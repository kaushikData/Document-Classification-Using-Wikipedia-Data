== Work ==

Abdul Vas work broaches heavily the obsessions of his home country Venezuela with the symbols of the American dream. Heavily influenced by [[Marc Chagall]], [[Mike Kelley (artist)|Mike Kelley]], [[Al Feldstein]] and [[James Ensor]], Vas's work heavily consists of depictions of aggressive and well-hung [[rooster]]s that represent the masculine element of the American cowboy-culture. Therefore, his pictures are full of references to the American baseball team [[Cincinnati Reds]], [[MLB]], [[Malcolm Young]],  [[the Rolling Stones]], [[Slayer]], [[Metallica]], [[the Black Crowes]], [[Muddy Waters]], [[SUV]]s, [[rock and roll]] and the symbols of the North American imperialist power: the [[Navistar]] trucks. Another common theme in his work is the Australian rock group [[AC/DC]], particularly lead singer [[Brian Johnson]]. Many of his other artworks are named after AC/DC songs or albums.

'''Beirut''' was a non-profit art institution that was founded in [[Giza]], [[Egypt]] in 2012. It was registered as Goldin + Senneby LLC in [[Cairo]], Egypt. The art space closed in 2015.

==Overview==
Beirut was an art initiative and exhibition space founded by Sarah Rifky and Jens Maier Rothe as a space that considers institution building as a curatorial act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newmuseum.org/blog/view/on-instituting-a-new-space-for-thought|title=On Instituting A New Space For Thought|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artterritories.net/?page_id=3202|title=008.01 BEIRUT  {{!}} ArtTerritories|website=www.artterritories.net|access-date=2016-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The institution’s activities were centered around hosting artists, artworks, research projects and other institutions engaging with similar questions of politics, economy, education, ecology and the arts. The art space was established in a late 1940s three-story villa surrounded by a little garden in the neighborhood of [[Agouza]], Giza. Beirut was initiated in the aftermath of the Egyptian uprising, examining the space of art during this insurgent time. It closed in 2015 following tightening security and decreased support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2012/10/30/beirut-in-cairo-the-citys-new-art-space/|title=Beirut in Cairo: the city’s new art space|date=30 October 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Imaginary School Program==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2016}} 
tISP was an eight-month cross-disciplinary practice and theory based program initiated by Beirut  in 2014. The program directed by Antonia Alampi, comprised a series of workshops, lectures, field trips and reading groups focused on the notion of instituting and organizing. Participants looked at collectives, non-movements, informal groups and non-governmental civic and cultural organizations in Cairo. tISP was designed in response too surge of new initiatives, collectives and institutions founded in Cairo following the 2011 uprising, taking a critical and investigative look at alternative civic infrastructures.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

The '''Celtic cross''' is a form of [[Christian cross]] featuring a [[halo (religious iconography)|nimbus]] or ring that emerged in [[Ireland]] and [[Great Britain|Britain]] in the [[Early Middle Ages]]. A type of [[ringed cross]], it became widespread through its use in the stone [[high cross]]es erected across the islands, especially in regions evangelized by [[Hiberno-Scottish mission|Irish missionaries]], from the 9th through the 12th centuries.

A staple of [[Insular art]], the Celtic cross is essentially a [[Latin cross]] with a nimbus surrounding the intersection of the arms and stem. Scholars have debated its exact origins, but it is related to earlier crosses featuring rings. The form gained new popularity during the [[Celtic Revival]] of the 19th century; the name "Celtic cross" is a convention dating from that time. The shape, usually decorated with [[Interlace (art)|interlace]] and other motifs from Insular art, became popular for funerary monuments and other uses, and has remained so, spreading well beyond Ireland.

==Early history==
[[File:Celtic Art in Pagan and Christian Times, p185.png|thumb|Early forms: cross slab, St. Madoes, Perthshire, Scotland]]
[[File:032Galarus Oratory.JPG|thumb|Early forms: pillar stone, [[Gallarus Oratory]], [[County Kerry]], Ireland]]

[[Ringed crosses]] similar to older Continental forms appeared in Ireland and Scotland in incised stone slab artwork and artifacts like the [[Ardagh chalice]]. However, the shape achieved its greatest popularity by its use in the monumental stone [[high cross]]es, a distinctive and widespread form of [[Insular art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Herren |first=Michael W. |last2= Brown|first2= Shirley Ann |year= 2002|title= Christ in Celtic Christianity: Britain and Ireland from the Fifth to the Tenth Century|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ZFqNUMa8bfYC&amp;pg=PA199&amp;dq=%22Celtic+cross%22+origin&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjWh6uw2OrPAhWG4iYKHRZDDrs Q6AEINTAE#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Celtic%20cross%22%20origin&amp;f=false |publisher= Boydell Press|pages= 193–195|isbn=0851158897}}&lt;/ref&gt; These monuments, which first appeared in the 9th century, usually (though not always) take the form of a ringed cross on a stepped or pyramidal base.&lt;ref name=Herren1&gt;{{cite book |last= Herren |first=Michael W. |last2= Brown|first2= Shirley Ann |year= 2002|title= Christ in Celtic Christianity: Britain and Ireland from the Fifth to the Tenth Century|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ZFqNUMa8bfYC&amp;pg=PA199&amp;dq=%22Celtic+cross%22+origin&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjWh6uw2OrPAhWG4iYKHRZDDrsQ6AEINTAE#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Celtic%20cross%22%20origin&amp;f=false |publisher= Boydell Press|page= 199|isbn=0851158897}}&lt;/ref&gt; The form has obvious structural advantages, reducing the length of unsupported side arms.&lt;ref&gt;Werner, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of theories as to its origin in Ireland and Britain. Some scholars consider the ring a holdover from earlier wooden crosses, which may have required struts to support the crossarm. Others have seen it as deriving from indigenous Bronze Age art featuring a wheel or disc around a head, or from early [[Coptic cross]]es based on the [[ankh]]. However, Michael W. Herren, Shirley Ann Brown, and others believe it originates in earlier ringed crosses in [[Christian art]]. Crosses with a ring representing the [[celestial sphere]] developed from the writings of the [[Church Fathers]]. The "cosmological cross" is an important motif in [[Coelius Sedulius]]'s poem ''[[Carmen Paschale]]'', known in Ireland by the 7th century.&lt;ref name=Herren2&gt;{{cite book |last= Herren |first=Michael W. |last2= Brown|first2= Shirley Ann |year= 2002|title= Christ in Celtic Christianity: Britain and Ireland from the Fifth to the Tenth Century|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ZFqNUMa8bfYC&amp;pg=PA199&amp;dq=%22Celtic+cross%22+origin&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjWh6uw2OrPAhWG4iYKHRZDDrsQ6AEINTAE#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Celtic%20cross%22%20origin&amp;f=false |publisher= Boydell Press|pages= 199–200|isbn=0851158897}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not clear where the first high crosses originated. The first examples date to about the 9th century and occur in two groups: at [[Ahenny]] in Ireland, and at [[Iona]], an Irish monastery off the Scottish coast. The Ahenny group is generally earlier. However, it is possible that St. Johns Cross at Iona was the first high cross; Iona's influence as a center of pilgrimage may have led this cross to inspire the Ahenny group as well as other ringed crosses in [[Pictish stone]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Werner, pp. 99–100.&lt;/ref&gt;

A variety of crosses bear inscriptions in [[ogham]]: an early medieval Irish alphabet. Standing crosses in Ireland and areas under Irish influence tend to be shorter and more massive than their Anglo-Saxon equivalents, which have mostly lost their headpieces. Irish examples with a head in cross form include the Cross of [[Kells, County Meath|Kells]], [[Ardboe High Cross]], the crosses at [[Monasterboice]], the Cross of the Scriptures, [[Clonmacnoise]] and those in Scotland at [[Iona]] and the [[Kildalton Cross]], which may be the earliest to survive in good condition. Surviving, free-standing crosses are in [[Cornwall]], including [[St Piran]]'s cross at [[Perranporth]], and [[Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;Langdon, Arthur G. (1896) Old Cornish Crosses. Truro: J. Pollard&lt;/ref&gt; Other stone crosses are found in the former [[Northumbria]] and [[Scotland]], and further south in England, where they merge with the similar Anglo-Saxon cross making tradition, in the [[Ruthwell Cross]] for example. Most examples in Britain were destroyed during the [[Protestant Reformation]]. By about A.D. 1200 the initial wave of cross building came to an end in Ireland.

Popular legend in Ireland says that the Christian cross was introduced by [[Saint Patrick]] or possibly [[Saint Declan]], though there are no examples from this early period. It has often been claimed that Patrick combined the symbol of Christianity with the [[sun cross]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;to give pagan followers an idea of the importance of the cross. By linking it with the idea of the life-giving properties of the sun, these two ideas were linked to appeal to pagans. Other interpretations claim that placing the cross on top of the circle represents Christ's supremacy over the pagan sun.

== Modern times ==

===Celtic Revival===
The [[Celtic Revival]] of the mid-19th century led to an increased use and creation of Celtic crosses in Ireland. In 1853, casts of several historical high crosses were exhibited at the Dublin Industrial Exhibition. In 1857, [[Henry O'Neill (illustrator)|Henry O'Neill]] published ''Illustrations of the Most Interesting of the Sculptured Crosses of Ancient Ireland''. These two events stimulated interest in the Celtic cross as a symbol for a renewed sense of heritage within Ireland.

New versions of the high cross were designed for fashionable cemetery monuments in Victorian Dublin in the 1860s. From Dublin, the revival spread to the rest of the country and beyond. Since the Celtic Revival, the ringed cross became an emblem of Celtic identity, in addition to its more traditional religious symbolism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.celtarts.com/revival_crosses.htm Stephen Walker, "Celtic Revival Crosses"], Celtic Arts website, accessed 22 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern interest in the symbol increased because of Alexander and Euphemia Ritchie. The two worked on the Isle of [[Iona]] in Scotland from 1899 to 1940 and popularised use of the Celtic cross in jewelry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alexander-ritchie.co.uk/history.htm "A Brief History of the Ritchies"], Alexander Ritchie website, accessed 20 Nov 208&lt;/ref&gt; Using the Celtic cross in fashion is still popular today.

&lt;/Gallery&gt;

Since its revival in the 1850s, the Celtic cross has been used extensively as grave markers. Straying from medieval usage, when the symbol was typically used for a public monument. The Celtic cross now appears in various retail items. Both the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] and the [[Northern Ireland national football team]] have used versions of the Celtic cross in their logos and advertising. The [[Church in Wales]] since 1954 have used a flag with a Celtic cross in the centre.

"'''Christmas Eve/Sarajevo 12/24'''" is an [[instrumental]] [[wiktionary:Medley|medley]] of "[[God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen]]" and "[[Shchedryk (song)|Shchedryk]]", first released on the [[Savatage]] album ''[[Dead Winter Dead]]'' in 1995 as "Christmas Eve (Sarajevo 12/24)." It was re-released by the [[Trans-Siberian Orchestra]], a side project of several Savatage members, on their 1996 debut album ''[[Christmas Eve and Other Stories]]''.  The piece describes a lone [[cello]] player playing a forgotten [[Christmas carol]] in war-torn [[Sarajevo]].

== Composition ==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}
"Christmas Eve/Sarajevo 12/24" consists of four sections, alternating between soft and loud, as well as between the two component pieces in the medley. Part one consists of "God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen" performed on a cello, accompanied only by a picked electric guitar and a flute in [[round (music)|round]]. After a short ritard, part two abruptly begins, with "Shchedryk" (recognizable in the English-speaking world as the melody from "[[Carol of the Bells]]") being played at full volume, full orchestration and the synthesizers and electric guitars taking lead melody. The time signature also abruptly shifts from [[alla breve|cut time]] to a driving [[triple meter]], which persists through the rest of the piece.

After a short transition, the third section consists of a piano solo, featuring [[Motif (music)|motifs]] from both melodies being played simultaneously, with light string backing that builds through the section. The transition to the fourth and final section is again abrupt; the final section closely resembles the second, with "Shchedryk" being the central melody, again led by guitar and synthesizer with piano added. The [[Coda (music)|coda]] consists of backing strings continuing softly after the fourth section ends, fading to a close.

Both of the tunes used in "Christmas Eve/Sarajevo 12/24" were in the [[public domain]] in 1995: "Shchedryk" was released in 1918 (although the English lyrics to "Carol of the Bells," dating to 1936, were still under copyright and were not included in the recording), while "God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen" dated back several centuries.

== Background and writing ==
Paul O'Neill explained the story behind '''''Christmas Eve/Sarajevo 12/24''''' in an interview published on ChristianityToday.com:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Breimeier | first = Russ | title = Interview with Paul O'Neill on ChristianityToday.com | publisher = ChristianityToday.com | date = 2003-12-22 | accessdate = 2007-12-14 | url = http://www.christianitytoday.com/music/interviews/2003/tso-1203.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|
... We heard about this cello player born in Sarajevo many years ago who left when he was fairly young to go on to become a well-respected musician, playing with various symphonies throughout Europe. Many decades later, he returned to Sarajevo as an elderly man—at the height of the [[Bosnian War]], only to find his city in complete ruins.

I think what most broke this man's heart was that the destruction was not done by some outside invader or natural disaster—it was done by his own people. At that time, Serbs were shelling Sarajevo every night. Rather than head for the bomb shelters like his family and neighbors, this man went to the town square, climbed onto a pile of rubble that had once been the fountain, took out his cello, and played Mozart and Beethoven as the city was bombed.

He came every night and began playing Christmas Carols from that same spot. It was just such a powerful image—a white-haired man silhouetted against the cannon fire, playing timeless melodies to both sides of the conflict amid the rubble and devastation of the city he loves. Some time later, a reporter traced him down to ask why he did this insanely stupid thing. The old man said that it was his way of proving that despite all evidence to the contrary, the spirit of humanity was still alive in that place.

The song basically wrapped itself around him. We used some of the oldest Christmas melodies we could find, like "God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen" and "Carol of the Bells" part of the medley (which is from Ukraine, near that region). The orchestra represents one side, the rock band the other, and single cello represents that single individual, that spark of hope.

The '''Church of St. Dunat''' ({{lang-hr|Crkva svetog Dunata}}) is a Roman Catholic church located on the island of [[Krk]], [[Croatia]].

==Location==
Church of St. Dunat was built at the intersection of roads leading to [[Punat]], [[Krk]], [[Kornić]] and [[Vrbnik]] where the Bay of Punat is most encased in the land, that is, at the bottom of Bay of Punat, by the sea.

==The significance, dating and form==
With the churches in [[Nin, Croatia|Nin]] and [[Zadar]], this one is the most important monument of early Croatian architecture. It cannot be determined with certainty when was it constructed. According to some, it was built in the 9th century. However, the information board near the church says that it was built in the 12th century.

Church has a four-leafed cruciform layout, square entrance and base with a dome covering it. Present-day appearance is undoubtedly significantly different from the previous, when it was covered with carved stone from the outside, which can still be seen only at the bottom. It was probably  decorated with mosaics and frescoes from the inside. It seems as if the unskilled master built it entirely spontaneously with no accurate measures and models.

==First mention==
Church was first mentioned in year 1565 when the Bishop Petar Bembo visited the area, and had examined witnesses which stated that the church was donated by bishop Donat a Turre (1484-1515) to the owners of terrains around [[Kornić]]. After his death, they have sold terrains which was followed by the period of edifices deterioration. During the visit of bishop Donat, a poor condition of church was determined. It was mentioned that it didn't have floor nor the door, while only preserved was altar.

==Dedication==
Church is dedicated to St. Dunat (not to be mistaken with [[Donatus of Zadar]]), an early Christian saint who was martyred during the persecution of emperor [[Julian (emperor)|Julian the Apostate]] in the second half of the 4th century. It is not known whom it was originally dedicated to.

==History of deterioration and renovation==
In addition to previously mentioned churches poor state, there is no other information about it so it can be assumed that it wasn't used for holding Holy Mass but was in the process of deterioration over the years. Church was restored in 1914 thanks to the Austrian conservator Anton Gnirs from [[Pula]]. However, immediately after World War II it was again damaged. Namely, in the immediate vicinity of the church was an inn of Maračić family where [[Yugoslav Partisans]] stored their weapons and ammunition during the war. On 3 October 1945 the explosion that badly damaged church, namely its dome, occurred. The explosion was so strong that it was heard all over the island. 15 islanders who have sought refuge in the surrounding fields and along the coast were killed while the area of the inn turned into a crater. Three years later, the church was restored to its present-day appearance. The renovation was led by the architect {{ill|Aleksandar Freudenreich|hr}}. At the site of the former inn was built anotherone while a small harbor was built nearby.

The '''Code of Hammurabi''' is a well-preserved [[Babylonia]]n [[code of law]] of ancient [[Mesopotamia]], dated back to about 1754 BC ([[Middle Chronology]]).  It is one of the oldest deciphered writings of significant length in the world. The sixth Babylonian king, [[Hammurabi]], enacted the code. A partial copy exists on a 2.25 metre (7.5 ft) stone [[stele]]. It consists of 282 laws, with scaled punishments, adjusting "an [[eye for an eye]], a tooth for a tooth" (''lex talionis'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Review: The Code of Hammurabi|first= J. Dyneley |last=Prince|journal= The American Journal of Theology |volume= 8| issue =  3 |date=July 1904|pages= 601–609 |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |jstor=3153895}}&lt;/ref&gt; as graded depending on social status, of slave versus free, man or woman.&lt;ref name="Bar"&gt;[[Gabriele Bartz]], Eberhard König, (Arts and Architecture), Könemann, Köln, (2005), {{ISBN|3-8331-1943-8}}. The laws were based with scaled punishments, adjusting "an eye for an eye" depending on social status.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly half of the code deals with matters of contract, establishing the wages to be paid to an ox driver or a surgeon for example. Other provisions set the terms of a transaction, the liability of a builder for a house that collapses, or property that is damaged while left in the care of another. A third of the code addresses issues concerning household and family relationships such as inheritance, divorce, paternity, and [[sexual behavior|reproductive behaviour]]. Only one provision appears to impose obligations on an official; this provision establishes that a judge who reaches an incorrect decision is to be fined and removed from the bench permanently.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commonlaw.com/Hammurabi.html Code of Hammurabi] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070921205329/http://www.commonlaw.com/Hammurabi.html |date=21 September 2007 }} at commonlaw.com  {{cite |url=http://www.commonlaw.com/home/legal-history-and-philosophy/code-of-hammurabi |date=22 May 2017 |title=Code of Hammarubi at Commonlaw }}&lt;/ref&gt; A few provisions address issues related to military service.

The code was discovered by modern [[archaeology|archaeologists]] in 1901, and its ''[[editio princeps]]'' translation published in 1902 by [[Jean-Vincent Scheil]]. This nearly complete example of the code is carved into a basalt stele in the shape of a huge [[index finger]],&lt;ref&gt;Iconographic Evidence for Some Mesopotamian Cult Statues, Dominique Collon, Die Welt der Götterbilder, Edited by Groneberg, Brigitte; Spieckermann, Hermann;, and Weiershäuser, Frauke, Berlin, New York (Walter de Gruyter) 2007, pp. 57–84&lt;/ref&gt; {{convert|2.25|m|foot|abbr=on}} tall. The code is inscribed in the [[Akkadian language]], using [[cuneiform script]] carved into the stele. 

It is currently on display in the [[Louvre]], with replicas in numerous institutions, including the [[University of Chicago Oriental Institute|Oriental Institute at the University of Chicago]], the Northwestern Pritzker School of Law in Chicago, the Clendening History of Medicine Library &amp; Museum at the University of Kansas Medical Center, the library of the [[Theological University of the Reformed Churches]] in the Netherlands, the [[Pergamon Museum]] of Berlin, the Arts Faculty of the University of Leuven in Belgium, the [[National Museum of Iran]] in Tehran, and the Department of Anthropology, [[National Museum of Natural History]], [[Smithsonian Institution]], the University Museum at the University of Pennsylvania, and [[Museum of the Bible]] in Washington, DC.

[[Hammurabi]] ruled for nearly 42 years, from about 1792 to 1749 BC according to the [[Middle chronology]]. In the preface to the law, he states, "[[Anu]] and [[Bel (mythology)|Bel]] called by name me, Hammurabi, the exalted prince, who feared God, to bring about the rule of righteousness in the land, to destroy the wicked and the evil-doers; so that the strong should not harm the weak; so that I should rule over the black-headed people like [[Shamash]], and enlighten the land, to further the well-being of mankind."&lt;ref name="wsu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/MESO/CODE.HTM |title=Mesopotamia: The Code of Hammurabi |accessdate=14 September 2007 |publisher=Washington State University |year=1996 |author1=Edited by Richard Hooker |author2=Translated by L.W King |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070909114038/http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/MESO/CODE.HTM |archivedate=9 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the stone slab are 44 columns and 28 paragraphs that contained 282 laws.

It had been taken as plunder by the [[Elam|Elamite]] king [[Shutruk-Nahhunte]] in the 12th century BC and was taken to [[Susa]] in [[Elam]] (located in the present-day [[Khuzestan Province]] of Iran) where it was no longer available to the Babylonian people. However, when [[Cyrus the Great]] brought both Babylon and Susa under the rule of his [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]], and placed copies of the document in the [[Cyrus the Great#Library at Sippar|Library of Sippar]], the text became available for all the peoples of the vast Persian Empire to view.&lt;ref&gt;Marc Van De Mieroop: A History of the Ancient Near East, second edition p. 296&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1901, Egyptologist [[Gustave Jéquier]], a member of an expedition headed by [[Jacques de Morgan]], found the stele containing the Code of Hammurabi during archaeological excavations at the ancient site of Susa in Khuzestan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0H0EpSm8aioC&amp;pg=PA313&amp;lpg=PA313&amp;dq=khuzestan+susa+hammurabi&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ckH25GVD5y&amp;sig=KJOFs2tnpffmgH_yfQUdZMagTUo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwBmoVChMI9KWthsvvyAIVR8FjCh2LZwPw#v=onepage&amp;q=khuzestan%20susa%20hammurabi&amp;f=false|title=Cultures in Contact: From Mesopotamia to the Mediterranean in the Second Millennium B.C|publisher=[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]|date=2013|access-date=November 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Laws of Hammurabi's Code==
{{Main article|Babylonian law}}
The Code of Hammurabi was one of the only sets of laws in the [[ancient Near East]] and also one of the first forms of law.&lt;ref name="yale"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/medieval/hamframe.htm |title=The Code of Hammurabi: Translated by L.W.

University of Michigan Library, 2009, (originally published in 1916 by American Sunday-School Union) p. 406.&lt;/ref&gt;
These codes come from similar cultures in a relatively small geographical area, and they have passages which resemble each other.&lt;ref&gt;Barton 2009, p. 406. Barton, a scientist of Semitic languages at the University of Pennsylvania from 1922 to 1931, stated that while there are similarities between the Mosaic Law and the Code of Hammurabi, a study of the entirety of both laws "convinces the student that the laws of the Old Testament are in no essential way dependent upon the Babylonian laws." He states that "such resemblances" arose from "a similarity of antecedents and of general intellectual outlook" between the two cultures, but that "the striking differences show that there was no direct borrowing."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Milkau Oberer Teil der Stele mit dem Text von Hammurapis Gesetzescode 369-2.png|thumb|Figures at the top of the stele "fingernail", above Hammurabi's code of laws.]]
The Code of Hammurabi is the longest surviving text from the Old Babylonian period.&lt;ref&gt;"The Code of Hammurabi," [http://www.historyguide.org/ancient/hammurabi.html], The History Guide, 3 August 2009, Retrieved on 2 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The code has been seen as an early example of a fundamental law, regulating a government – i.e., a primitive [[constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;What is a Constitution? William David Thomas, Gareth Stevens (2008) p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Flach, Jacques.  Le Code de Hammourabi et la constitution originaire de la propriete dans l'ancienne Chaldee. (Revue historique.  Paris, 1907. 8. v. 94, pp. 272–289.&lt;/ref&gt; The code is also one of the earliest examples of the idea of [[presumption of innocence]], and it also suggests that both the accused and accuser have the opportunity to provide [[evidence]].&lt;ref&gt;Victimology: Theories and Applications, Ann Wolbert Burgess, Albert R. Roberts, Cheryl Regehr, Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning, 2009, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; The occasional nature of many provisions suggests that the code may be better understood as a codification of Hammurabi's supplementary judicial decisions, and that, by memorializing his wisdom and justice, its purpose may have been the self-glorification of Hammurabi rather than a modern legal code or constitution. However, its copying in subsequent generations indicates that it was used as a model of legal and judicial reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;For this alternative interpretation see Jean Bottéro, "The 'Code' of Hammurabi" in ''Mesopotamia: Writing, Reasoning and the Gods'' (University of Chicago, 1992), pp. 156–184.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Code of Hammurabi was trying to achieve equality, biases still existed towards those categorized in the lower end of the social spectrum and some of the punishments and justice could be gruesome. The magnitude of criminal penalties often was based on the identity and gender of both the person committing the crime and the victim. The Code issues justice following the three classes of Babylonian society: property owners, freed men, and slaves.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.history.com/news/history-lists/8-things-you-may-not-know-about-hammurabis-code|title=8 Things You May Not Know About Hammurabi’s Code|work=History.com|access-date=2017-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Punishments for someone assaulting someone from a lower class were far lighter than if they had assaulted someone of equal or higher status.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.history.com/news/history-lists/8-things-you-may-not-know-about-hammurabis-code|title=8 Things You May Not Know About Hammurabi’s Code|work=History.com|access-date=2017-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if a doctor killed a rich patient, he would have his hands cut off, but if he killed a slave, only financial restitution was required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyextra.com/article/international-history/nutshell-babylon|title=What was Babylon? |work=History Extra}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women could also receive punishments that their male counterparts would not, as men were permitted to have affairs with their servants and slaves, whereas married women would be harshly punished for committing adultery.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Various copies of portions of the Code of Hammurabi have been found on baked clay tablets, some possibly older than the celebrated basalt stele now in the Louvre. The Prologue of the Code of Hammurabi (the first 305 inscribed squares on the stele) is on such a tablet, also at the Louvre (Inv #AO 10237). Some gaps in the list of benefits bestowed on cities recently annexed by Hammurabi may imply that it is older than the famous stele (currently dated to the early 18th century BC).&lt;ref&gt;Fant, Clyde E. and Mitchell G.

B. Eerdmans Publishing Co., p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the [[Museum of the Ancient Orient]], part of the [[Istanbul Archaeology Museums]], also has a "Code of Hammurabi" clay tablet, dated to 1790 BC, in (Room 5, Inv # Ni 2358).&lt;ref&gt;[[John Freely|Freely, John]], ''Blue Guide Istanbul'' (5th ed., 2000), London: [[A&amp;C Black]], New York: [[WW Norton]], p. 121. ("The most historic of the inscriptions here [i.e., Room 5, Museum of the Ancient Orient, Istanbul] is the famous Code of Hammurabi (#Ni 2358) dated 1750 BCE, the world's oldest recorded set of laws.")&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.istanbul.gov.tr/Default.aspx?pid=13150 Museum of the Ancient Orient website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503212551/http://english.istanbul.gov.tr/Default.aspx?pid=13150 |date=3 May 2012 }} ("This museum contains a rich collection of ancient ... archaeological finds, including ... seals from Nippur and a copy of the Code of Hammurabi.")&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2010, archaeologists reported that a fragmentary Akkadian cuneiform tablet was discovered at [[Tel Hazor]], [[Israel]], containing a c. 1700 BC text that was said to be partly parallel to portions of the Hammurabi code. The Hazor law code fragments are currently being prepared for publication by a team from the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/138788|title=Code of Hammurabi Tablet Found |work=Inside Israel News – Arutz Sheva}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each character in '''[[Commedia dell'arte]]''' is distinctly different, and defined by their movement, actions, [[Commedia dell'Arte Masks|masks]], and costumes. These costumes show their social status and background.

'''[[Pantalone]]''' typically wore tight red pants and a matching shirt, a long black cape, black or red pointed shoes, and a belt that had a purse attached. Pantalone also carried a knife and handkerchief, and wore glasses. His hat sat very close to his head, and did not have a brim – very much like a skullcap. He might also wear a [[codpiece]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Lea, K. M. Italian popular comedy. A study in the Commedia dell’Arte, 1560–1620 with special reference to the English stage. 1934. Reprint.

New York: Hill and Wang, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Il Dottore]]''' was dressed almost entirely in black – shoes, pants, shirt, robe, belt, and hat – broken only by a white handkerchief, white ruffled collar, white cuffs on his sleeves, or maybe white socks. The pants came to his knees, as did the full cloak that stood out, like a dress with a petticoat. His hat could either be small and look like a skullcap, or larger and floppy with a wide brim.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''[[Il Capitano]]''' did not have a consistent dress code, but he did have a consistent costume theme. He wore the current soldiers' outfit from a foreign country.  Sometimes his clothes were slashed to show that he had been in battle. His hat was overdone and typically had large feathers sticking out of it. Ribbons and shiny buttons often cluttered his clothes. He always carried a sword, and in the seventeenth century the sword upgraded to a gun. Every Il Capitano costume also included a coat or cloak, that he could fling off in a moment of rage or passion.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''[[Innamorati|The Lovers]]''' wore whatever was the latest fashion. They wore a lot of makeup, but tastefully done to match the elaborate outfits. They never wore masks.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''[[Pulcinella]]''' always had white baggy pants and shirt, large buttons on the shirt, and a piece under his garments that made his belly appear very large. His clothes were held on by a rope belt, where a dagger and purse would hang. A humpback piece was sometimes used. He also wore a mask that depicted a large, sometimes broken nose. His hat was short and fluffy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Gordon, Mel. Lazzi: The Comedic Routines of the Commedia dell’Arte.

{{Right|[[File:André Derain - Arlequin et Pierrot.jpg|thumb|Harlequin in diamonds, and Pierrot in white]]}}
'''[[Harlequin|Harlequin's]]''' costume has varied over time. At first, in the mid sixteen century, his clothes were light colored and baggy, with red, yellow, and green patches with no particular pattern. His facial hair suggested a younger man for a few years, but then a fuller beard was worn later. He had a black mask and a feathered white hat. About a hundred years later, his signature outfit changed to include white stripes and colored diamonds, or triangles instead of patches. For the next 200 years, the suit got tighter, and a black belt was added. He wore a hat with two points, and his clothes had lots of sparkles. By the twentieth century, all the sparkles, collar ruffles, and large fancy hats were gone. Arlecchino wore a very small hat, the mask was sometimes swapped out for a face-painted diamond, and the costume pattern became entirely made up of diamonds with a small bow or collar.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''[[Brighella]]''' wore a servant's suit of rough off-white fabric, trimmed with green on the sides of his pants and down the front of his long shirt. His mask had a hooked nose, beard, and mustache. His dagger was worn at his belt.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''[[Coviello]]''' had a lighter beige mask with a large nose, and his white costume had bells attached.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''[[Mezzettino]]''' wore servant's clothes with red stripes, but without the common servant's mask.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''[[Zanni]]''' was the main servant, who wore large loose pants and a shirt that had a hood.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''[[Pierrot]]''' had loose white clothing, with a large matching collar. He painted his face white instead of wearing a mask.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''[[Pedrolino|Pedrolino's]]''' costume was essentially like Pierrot's – white, big buttons, short hat, and white face – but it was way too big for him, and the sleeves covered his hands, to emphasize that Pedrolino was a little person in hand-me-downs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''{{ill|Peppe Nappa|it}}''' copied Pierrot's clothes, but wore them in blue instead of white.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''[[Scaramouche]]''' wore black clothes without a mask. Defiant eyebrows and a powdered face accompanied the large black mustache. He had a white collar, and a large loose hat that hung down over his neck.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''''The Couple in a Cage: Two Amerindians Visit the West''''' was a 1992-1993 performance art piece by artists [[Guillermo Gómez-Peña]] and [[Coco Fusco]] for their exhibition ''The Year of the White Bear and Two Undiscovered Amerindians Visit the West--''which toured five countries and was performing in nine different locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.blouinartinfo.com/news/story/760842/still-in-the-cage-thoughts-on-two-undiscovered-amerindians-20-years-later|title=Still in the Cage: Thoughts on "Two Undiscovered Amerindians," 20 Years Later|last=Fusco|first=Coco|date=2012|work=|newspaper=BlouinArtInfo|access-date=2018-06-22|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; First performed in honor of the [[quincentenary]] anniversary of [[Christopher Columbus]]' arrival to the Americas, the work sought to make visible the history of abuse, captivity and exploitation of indigenous peoples.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blogs.walkerart.org/visualarts/2014/10/14/a-history-of-revisionism-contemporary-art-and-columbusindigenous-peoples-day/|title=A History of Revisionism: Contemporary Art and Columbus/Indigenous People’s Day|last=Lopez|first=Mia|date=October 14, 2014|work=|newspaper=Walker Art Center (Blog)|access-date=2016-12-06|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their inspiration drew heavily upon the history of [[othering]], the [[human zoo]], and life stories of historical figures such as [[Ota Benga]] and [[Sarah Baartman]]—beginning with the kidnapping of [[Arawak]] Indian by Columbus and his men to be displayed in the Spanish Court.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Staging and performance==
Presenting themselves as previously undiscovered Amerindians from the fictional uncolonized island of Guatinau, Fusco and Gómez-Peña presented a fabricated [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] entry on "Amerindians" and a corresponding map of the [[Gulf of Mexico]] island of Guatinau as part of the staging of their performance.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  This information was further supplemented both by plaques or pedestals alluding to the history of peoples placed on exhibit over the last 500 years.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Other texts provided also narrated their role as volunteer representatives of Guatinau, detailing the daily life activities of the Amerindians, and validating the habitat of the cage and its contents as their natural habitat.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Aided by the students of the University of California-Irvine, the artists erected a cage and filled it with a ghetto blaster, candles, Polaroid camera and film, bed pans, ritual artifacts, spray paint, body paint, a television and hammock.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Students and institutional staff members served as guards and assistants to the caged couple: feeding them, educating the audience about their origins, and assisting audience members in taking commemorative Polaroids with the caged performers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Those acting as docents or guards also were responsible for the daily disposal of cage waste, feeding the performers, and escorting them to the bathroom on a leash.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Gómez-Peña and Fusco were outfitted in primitive costumes:  designer sunglasses, a cheetah [[luchador]] mask, [[banda people|banda]] boots, face paint, long wigs, grass skirt, necklaces, a leopard bikini top and Converse low sneakers.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The caged artists performed "traditional" Guatinau tasks:  watching television, sewing [[voodoo doll]]s, using a laptop computer, pacing back and forth, eating or being fed fruit, and drinking bottled water and Coca-Cola Classic.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1992/10/20/performance/64a5c70e-d3db-4cd6-ad7f-62596334d1b9/|title=PERFORMANCE|last=Sommers|first=Pamela|date=1992-10-20|newspaper=The Washington Post|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286|access-date=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In stark contrast to works from their own practices and from other collaborations, the artists remained silent during the performances, apart from Gómez-Peña, who would recite traditional stories in a fictitious nonsensical language in return for donations.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bombmagazine.org/article/1599/coco-fusco-and-guillermo-g-mez-pe-a|title=BOMB Magazine — Coco Fusco and Guillermo Gómez-Peña by Anna Johnson|website=bombmagazine.org|access-date=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the last performance, these "traditional stories" chronicled the Guatinaui tour of the West, with the nonsensical outpouring peppered with recognizable words like "Chicago", "Mexico", "Minnesota" and "America".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Who We Be: A Cultural History of Race in Post-Civil Rights America|last=Chang|first=Jeff|publisher=St. Martin's Press|date=October 21, 2014|isbn=1250074894|location=New York, NY|pages=151|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contexts ==
===[[University of California-Irvine]]===
As "Take One" of ''The Year of the White Bear,'' held at the Fine Arts Gallery of UC-Irvine from February 24 - March 4, 1992, with performances held all day March 1, 2, 3 with "ritual events" at 7:30 on the 3rd and 4th&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ucisca.wordpress.com/2011/03/11/guillermo-gomez-pena-and-coco-fusco-in-1992/|title=Guillermo Gomez-Pena &amp; Coco Fusco The Year of the White Bear: Take One|last=Gomez-Pena|first=Guillermo|date=February 24, 1992|work=|access-date=October 11, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the performance the artists were contacted by the Health Department of UC-Irvine due to the misunderstanding that they were anthropologists bringing in "real aborigines" whose excrement could be hazardous.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; One woman went so far as to ask for a rubber glove in order to fondle Gómez-Peña in a sexual manner.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Approximately 1,000 individuals saw these performances.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== [[Plaza de Colón|Columbus Plaza]], Madrid  ===
Selected for the Edge Biennial, the artists took their performance to a much more public context in Columbus Plaza of May 1992.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Edge '92, taking place in both London and Madrid, was planned as a quincentennial celebration of Madrid as a hub of European culture.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Spanish businessmen reverted to childhood, mocking the performers with ape noises,&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; while school children compared the performers to the wax [[Arawak]] figures housed in the museum across the street.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Teenagers also attempted to burn Gómez-Peña while handing him a beer bottle filled with urine.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Men donated to see Fusco dance, explaining that they wanted to see her breasts.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; More than half of the people believed the performance to be a real display of Amerindians.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== [[Covent Gardens]], London ===
Three days after Madrid, the pair performed in Covent Gardens.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Covent Gardens as a venue has a history as a location where people of color have been exhibited, starting from the 17th century through to the 18th century.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; It was even the venue for the play [[Omai (play)|''Omai'']], inspired by the [[Omai]], a Tahitian native who embodied the idea of the [[noble savage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/the-savage-art-of-the-human-zoo/news-story/39b1994d89368a8dcad69f7161812a04|title=The savage art of the human zoo|last=Leetberg|first=Ilmar|date=2012-02-19|work=The Australian|access-date=2016-12-12|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the performance a group of neo-nazis attempted to rattle the cage.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== [[Walker Art Center]], Minneapolis ===
Exhibited as part of their show ''The Year of the White Bear'', the performance took place outside in the Sculpture Garden of the Walker Art Center in September 1992.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; 15,000 visitors saw the performance and exhibition.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Many audience members believed the performance to be real.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This is the first of two instances in which the work was clearly presented in an art context.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== [[Smithsonian Museum of Natural History|Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History]], Washington D.C. ===
On view from October 17-18th, 1992,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; the performance reached approximately 120,000 visitors over a two-day period.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The performance confused many museum goers who questioned the authenticity, and who were even more perplexed when docents continued to keep up the performance.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; One alarmed attendee even called the Humane Society to seek assistance in freeing the caged couple.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== [[Australian Museum]] of Natural History, Sydney ===
In December 1992 the artists performed at the Australian Museum of Natural History, with approximately 5,000 visitors; staff members here became uneasy after Japanese tourists left the museum deeply disturbed, fearing this would result in negative press for the museum.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; One woman sat down with her young child to loudly apologize to the performers for having "taken [their] land away".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===[[Field Museum of Natural History]], Chicago ===
From January 16–17, 1993 Gómez-Peña and Fusco performed at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, aided by Field Museum "docents" played by Paula Killen, Claire DeCoster and Pablo Helguera.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/specimens-from-the-new-world/Content?oid=881265|title=Specimens From the New World|last=Rago|first=Carmela|website=Chicago Reader|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a script written by the artists, DeCoster and Helguera encouraged the audience's questions and analysis while members of the museum's education department surveyed visitors.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This was a devastating experience for the docents, as they witnessed the large majority of the audience persistently ignore the plaques on either side of the cage and believe the Amerindians to be real.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Approximately 5,000 people attended, with the Field Museum receiving 48 phone calls regarding the misinformation the public believed was due to the Field Museum.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== [[Whitney Biennial]], New York ===
''The Couple in the Cage: Two Undiscovered Amerindians Visit the West'' ended its tour as a selection of the 1993 Whitney Biennial, an exhibition noted to be one of the most consciousness-raising in the history of the Biennial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artspace.com/magazine/art_101/in_focus/history_whitney_biennial-52098|title=A Brief History of the Whitney Biennial, America's Most Controversial Art Show|website=Artspace|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the traditional Guatinaui tasks Gómez-Peña and Fusco consistently performed, the artists offered views of Gómez-Peña's genitals for donations of five dollars a view, and a native dance to hip hop music for fifty cents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1993-03-10/entertainment/ca-1335_1_art-world|title=ART REVIEW :  Crushed by Its Good Intentions :  Under the banner of opening up the institutional art world to expansive diversity, the Whitney Biennial has in fact perversely narrowed its scope to an almost excruciating degree.|last=KNIGHT|first=CHRISTOPHER|date=1993-03-10|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035|access-date=2016-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the one of the two instances in which the work was clearly presented and contextualized as artwork during the entirety of its tour.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fusco|first=Coco|date=1994-01-01|title=The Other History of Intercultural Performance|jstor=1146361|journal=TDR (1988-)|volume=38|issue=1|pages=143–167|doi=10.2307/1146361}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, some attendees assumed the artists were actors performing in a work by an artist.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Reception ==
Criticism for ''The Couple in a Cage'' varied upon the location of the presentation, though what alarmed the artists most was the substantial public belief that their performances were reality and the substantial number of critics who critiqued their work as unethical due to its misrepresentation, rather than to fully discuss its cultural and institutional critique.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Despite a substantial number of intellectuals remaining critical towards the misinformation of the performances, performative scholar [[Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett]] points out that Gómez-Peña's and Fusco's were not the first to fictionalize ethnography, but rather participate inside a previously established history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kirshenblatt-Gimblett|first=Barbara|year=Summer 1998|title=The Ethnographic Burlesque|url=http://www.nyu.edu/classes/bkg/web/couple.PDF|journal=The Drama Review: A Journal of Performative Studies|volume=42| issue =  2|pages=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The performance gained further recognition and criticism through its participation in the 1993 Whitney Biennial; despite reflecting the political times, art critic [[Roberta Smith]] disparaged that the exhibition lost sight of art as a visual experience in its motivations to further a cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/05/arts/at-the-whitney-a-biennial-with-a-social-conscience.html|title=AT THE WHITNEY, A BIENNIAL WITH A SOCIAL CONSCIENCE|last=Smith|first=Roberta|date=1993-03-05|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In stark contrast to the Western response, people of color responded either in distaste due to the inauthenticity of the performance, discomfort in identifying with the experience, or solidarity in its symbolism:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;"One Pueblo elder from Arizona who saw us in the Smithsonian went so far as to say that our display was more "real" than any other statement about the condition of Native peoples in the Museum." &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;-Coco Fusco, ''The Other History of Intercultural Performance''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3401">[[File:Pre-Columbian collection, Dumbarton OaksDSCF7954.JPG|thumb|The Dumbarton Oaks birthing figure]]
The '''Dumbarton Oaks birthing figure''' is a possibly [[Aztec]] [[scapolite]] figurine of a woman giving childbirth in a [[Childbirth positions#Squatting position|squatting position]]. Housed in the [[Dumbarton Oaks]] collection, United States, the figurine is considered by several scholars to be a [[pre-Columbian art]]work, while others believe it was made in modern times, possibly in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="jsa"&gt;{{cite web | url =https://jsa.revues.org/8623|title=The Dumbarton Oaks Tlazolteotl: looking beneath the surface|work=[[Journal de la Société des Américanistes]]|author=Jane MacLaren Walsh| date=2008| accessdate =Aug 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The figurine measures 20.2&amp;nbsp;cm in height.

Birthing figures, while common in [[New Spain|Colonial Mexican]] manuscripts, are rare in Aztec three-dimensional art. Women, however, occupied a prominent position in the [[Aztec mythology]].

==Provenance==
Early mentions of the figurine come from [[Ernest-Théodore Hamy]], who first saw it in a [[Paris]] antique store.&lt;ref name="twp"&gt;{{cite web | url =https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/a-stone-figure-at-dumbarton-oaks-tells-an-intriguing-story/2014/01/13/495c2b98-7c85-11e3-95c6-0a7aa80874bc_story.html|title=Local Intriguing story behind a stone figure at Dumbarton Oaks|work=[[The Washington Post]]| author=John Kelly|date=Jan 13, 2014| accessdate =Aug 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The figurine was later bought by French obstetrician and collector Alban Ribemont-Dessaignes.&lt;ref name="twp"/&gt; In 1947, the figure was acquired by [[Robert Woods Bliss]], the founder of [[Dumbarton Oaks]].&lt;ref name="twp"/&gt;

==Authenticity==
The first scholarly article about the figurine was written by [[Ernest-Théodore Hamy]] in 1899 and called it "absolutely unique in the history of Mexican art".&lt;ref name="jsa"/&gt; In 1906, Hamy published an article in the ''[[Journal de la Société des Américanistes]]'' writing that the figurine is of [[pre-Columbian Mexican]] origin and represents the Aztec goddess Ixcuina, also known as [[Tlazolteotl]]. Scholars such as [[Pal Kelemen]], [[Miguel Covarrubias]], [[John Alden Mason]], [[Michael D. Coe]] and [[Jeffrey Quilter]] also considered the figurine to be authentic.&lt;ref name="jsa"/&gt; Others, such as [[Claude-François Baudez]] and [[Esther Pasztory]], question the figurine's stylistic features. The authenticity was also questioned on the basis of technical virtuosity compared to the technical limitations of pre-Columbian artisans.&lt;ref name="jsa"/&gt; According to [[Jane MacLaren Walsh]], "the essential nature of the sculpture is almost completely anomalous with regard to the accepted canon of Mexica art, and does not in fact resemble any other Mesoamerican art form" and "the choice of stone, the complicated carving in the round, the birthing position, the facial expression of the mother, the somewhat grotesque realism, the lack of iconographic detail all point to a highly [[idiosyncratic]] work".&lt;ref name="jsa"/&gt;

''E.S.P.'' is a [[computer and video game|game]] giving players the opportunity to find out whether they possess [[extrasensory perception]]. While displaying a constantly changing graphic design on the screen, the program briefly flashes emotionally charged words, randomly chosen from a word list, on the screen.  The program then asks a series of questions to determine if the player's attitudes have been influenced by the subliminal messages.  A file-builder is included to allow players to insert new words in the data base.

The program was offered in both a stand-alone [[Floppy disk#The 5.BC-inch minifloppy|disk]] version and a compendium, along with ''E.S.P.'' and ''Zintar'', called Party-Pak I.  However, Edu-Ware dropped the game from its product line by the time its August 1, 1980 catalog was issued.

''Perception'' is a [[puzzle game]] consisting of three [[Video game|games]] designed to challenge and improve players' [[visual perception|visual skills]]. The first involves using [[Paddle (game controller)|game paddles]] to draw lines matching those drawn by the computer.  The second, based on a [[World War II]] test for [[spy]] candidates, tests players' power of observation by showing them only small glimpses of an [[abstract object]] as a narrow mask travels over it and then asking them to choose from among several objects what they had just seen.  The third modules tests player's visual memory by requiring them to distinguish sizes of identical shapes.  Players have control over the shape, display time, and presentation format.

Originally developed by Steffin before founding Edu-Ware, he wrote a second version of the program soon after establishing the [[Video game publisher|publishing company]]. The program was offered as both a stand-alone versions, and in a compendium, along with ''Statistics'' and ''[[Compu-Read]]'', called Edu-Pak I. Edu-Ware upgraded the program to high respolution graphics using its EWS3 graphics engine in [[1982 in video gaming|1982]], renaming it ''Perception 3.0'', which was featured in the company's catalogs until [[1984 in video gaming|1984]].

''Rescue'' is a low-resolution graphics [[action game]] in which the player uses [[Paddle (game controller)|game paddles]] move his spaceship to intercept with a damaged ship randomly floating around the screen. The program was offered in both [[Floppy disk#The 5.BC-inch minifloppy|disk]] and [[Cassette tape|cassette]] stand-alone versions, as well as in a compendium, along with ''War'', called Rescue/War, but was dropped from Edu-Ware's catalog by [[1980 in video gaming|1980]].

''Statistics'' is an [[analytical software|analytical program]] performing many of the statistical calaculations ordinally found in [[FORTRAN]] driven SPSS programs of the time.  Calculations performed by the program included mean, variance, standard deviation, Pearson correlation, normal distribution, Chi-square test, and T-Test.

The program was offered in both [[Floppy disk#The 5.BC-inch minifloppy|disk]] and [[Cassette tape|cassette]] stand-alone versions, as well as in a compendium, along with ''Perception'' and ''[[Compu-Read]]'', called Edu-Pak I.

Originally developed by Steffin before founding Edu-Ware, the company upgraded the program to high respolution graphics using its EWS3 graphics engine in [[1982 in video gaming|1982]], renaming it ''Statistics 3.0'', which was featured in the company's catalogs until [[1984 in video gaming|1984]].

''War'' is a numeric [[strategy game]] occurring in ten rounds.  In each round, the program would display a number on the screen and allow the player to type another number in response.  The program would then use both numbers in a formula to determine the winner for that round, and the side that won the most number of rounds would win the game.  The challenge for the player was to determine the formula the program was using to determine the winner in each round.

The program was offered in both [[Floppy disk#The 5.BC-inch minifloppy|disk]] and [[Cassette tape|cassette]] stand-alone versions, as well as in a compendium, along with ''Rescue'', called Rescue/War, but was dropped from Edu-Ware's product line by the time its March 1, 1980 catalog was issued.

'''''Erin Brockovich''''' is a 2000 American [[biographical film]] directed by [[Steven Soderbergh]] and written by [[Susannah Grant]]. The film is a dramatization of the true story of [[Erin Brockovich]], portrayed by [[Julia Roberts]], who fought against the energy corporation [[Pacific Gas and Electric Company]] (PG&amp;E). The film was a box office success, and critical reaction was positive.

Roberts won the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]], [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA]], [[Golden Globe Award]], [[Screen Actors Guild Award]], and various critics awards for Best Actress. The film itself was also nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Steven Soderbergh at the [[73rd Academy Awards]]. He won that year, but for directing the film ''[[Traffic (2000 film)|Traffic]]''.  Early in the film the real Erin Brockovich has a [[cameo appearance]] as a waitress named Julia.

==Plot==
In 1993, [[Erin Brockovich]] is an unemployed single mother of three children who has recently been injured in a traffic accident with a doctor and is suing him. Her lawyer, [[Edward L. Masry|Ed Masry]], expects to win, but Erin's explosive courtroom behavior under [[cross-examination]] loses her the case, and Ed will not return her phone calls afterwards. One day, he arrives at work to find her in the office, apparently working. She says that he told her things would work out and they did not, and that she needed a job. Smart and hardworking she asks Ed for a job, which he reluctantly gives her. 

Erin is given files for a real estate case where the [[Pacific Gas and Electric Company]] (PG&amp;E) is offering to purchase the home of Donna Jensen, a resident of [[Hinkley, California]]. Erin is surprised to see medical records in the file and visits Donna, who explains that she had simply kept all her PG&amp;E correspondence together. Donna appreciates PG&amp;E's help: she has had several tumors and her husband has [[Hodgkin's lymphoma]], but PG&amp;E has always supplied a doctor at their own expense. Erin asks why they would do that, and Donna replies, "because of the chromium". Erin begins digging into the case and finds evidence that the groundwater in Hinkley is seriously contaminated with carcinogenic [[hexavalent chromium]], but PG&amp;E has been telling Hinkley residents that they use a safer form of chromium. After several days away from the office investigating, she finds her possessions missing from her desk. She is then informed by Brenda, Mr. Masry's secretary, that she has been fired. 

Rehired, she continues her research, and over time, visits many Hinkley residents and wins their trust. She finds many cases of tumors and other medical problems in Hinkley. Everyone has been treated by PG&amp;E's doctors and thinks the cluster of cases is just a coincidence, unrelated to the "safe" chromium. The Jensens' claim for compensation grows into a major [[class action]] lawsuit, but the direct evidence only relates to PG&amp;E's Hinkley plant, not to the senior management.

Knowing that PG&amp;E could slow any settlement for years through delays and appeals, Ed takes the opportunity to arrange for disposition by binding arbitration, but a large majority of the plaintiffs must agree to this. Erin returns to Hinkley and persuades all 634 plaintiffs to go along. While she is there, a man named Charles Embry approaches her to say that he and his cousin were PG&amp;E employees, but his cousin recently died from the poison. The man says he was tasked with destroying documents at PG&amp;E, but, "as it turns out," he "wasn't a very good employee".

Embry gives Erin the documents, which include a 1966 memo proving corporate headquarters knew the water was contaminated with hexavalent chromium, did nothing about it, and advised the Hinkley operation to keep this secret. The judge orders PG&amp;E to pay a settlement amount of $333 million to be distributed among the plaintiffs.

In the aftermath, Ed hands Erin her bonus payment for the case but warns her he has changed the amount. She explodes into a complaint that she deserves more respect, but is astonished to find that he has increased it—to $2 million.

===Reviews===
The majority of critics responded favorably towards the film, with Roberts's performance receiving positive reviews. It holds a certified "Fresh" rating of 84% on film review website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] and 73 metascore on [[Metacritic]]. In his review for ''[[The New York Observer]]'', [[Andrew Sarris]] wrote, "We get the best of independent cinema and the best of mainstream cinema all in one package. ''Erin Brockovich'', like ''[[Wonder Boys (film)|Wonder Boys]]'' right before it, makes the year 2000 seem increasingly promising for movies".&lt;ref name= "sarris"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sarris|first=Andrew|coauthors=|title=She Doesn't Have a Résumé, but She's Got Other Assets|work=[[The New York Observer]]|pages=|language=|publisher=|date=March 19, 2000|url=http://www.observer.com/node/42723|accessdate=March 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Newsweek]]'' magazine's [[David Ansen]] began his review with, "Julia Roberts is flat-out terrific in ''Erin Brockovich''." Furthermore, he wrote, "Roberts has wasted her effervescence on many paltry projects, but she hits the jackpot this time. Erin, single mother of three, a former Miss [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]] who improbably rallies a community to take on a multi-billion-dollar corporation, is the richest role of her career, simultaneously showing off her comic, dramatic and romantic chops".&lt;ref name= "ansen"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ansen|first=David|coauthors=|title=A Trash-Talking Crusader|work=[[Newsweek]]|pages=|language=|publisher=|date=March 13, 2000|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/83319|accessdate=March 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine's [[Peter Travers]] wrote, "Roberts shows the emotional toll on Erin as she tries to stay responsible to her children and to a job that has provided her with a first taste of self-esteem".&lt;ref name= "travers"&gt;{{cite news|last=Travers|first=Peter|coauthors=|title=''Erin Brockovich''|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|pages=|language=|publisher=|date=February 9, 2001|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/5947601/review/5947602/erin_brockovich|accessdate=December 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his review for ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', [[Owen Gleiberman]] gave the film a "B+" rating and wrote, "It's a delight to watch Roberts, with her flirtatious sparkle and undertow of melancholy, ricochet off Finney's wonderfully jaded, dry-as-beef-jerky performance as the beleaguered career attorney who knows too much about the loopholes of his profession to have much faith left in it".&lt;ref name= "gleiberman"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gleiberman|first=Owen|coauthors=|title=''Erin Brockovich''|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|pages=|language=|publisher=|date=March 24, 2000|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,275735,00.html|accessdate=December 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Sight &amp; Sound]]'' magazine's Andrew O'Hehir wrote, "Perhaps the best thing about this relaxed and supremely engaging film (for my money the best work either the director or his star has ever done) is that even its near-fairytale resolution doesn't offer a magical transformation".&lt;ref name="OHehir"&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Hehir|first=Andrew|coauthors=|title=''Erin Brockovich''|work=[[Sight and Sound]]|pages=|language=|publisher=|date=May 2000|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/review/354|accessdate=March 4, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091231174708/http://www.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/review/354|archivedate=December 31, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her review for ''[[The Village Voice]]'', [[Amy Taubin]] wrote, "What's pretty original about the picture is that it focuses an investigative drama based on a true story around a comic performance".&lt;ref name= "taubin"&gt;{{cite news|last=Taubin|first=Amy|coauthors=|title=Tit for Tat|work=[[The Village Voice]]|pages=|language=|publisher=|date=March 14, 2000|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2000-03-14/film/tit-for-tat/1|accessdate=March 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, film critic [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film a two-star review, writing, "There is obviously a story here, but ''Erin Brockovich'' doesn't make it compelling. The film lacks focus and energy, the character development is facile and thin".&lt;ref name= "ebert"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ebert|first=Roger|coauthors=|title=''Erin Brockovich''|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|pages=|language=|publisher=|date=March 17, 2000|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20000317/REVIEWS/3170303/1023|accessdate=May 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his review for ''[[The New York Times]]'', A.O. Scott wrote, "After proving, for about 40 minutes, what a marvelous actress she can be, Ms. Roberts spends the next 90 content to be a movie star. As the movie drags on, her performance swells to bursting with moral vanity and phony populism".&lt;ref name= "scott"&gt;{{cite news|last=Scott|first=A.O|coauthors=|title=''Erin Brockovich'': High Ideals, Higher Heels|work=[[The New York Times]]|pages=|language=|publisher=|date=March 17, 2000|url=https://www.nytimes.com/library/film/031700erin-film-review.html|accessdate=December 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's Richard Corliss found the film to be "slick, grating and false.

[[American Film Institute]] recognition:

** Erin Brockovich — No. 31
* [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Cheers]] – No. 73

==Accuracy==
On her website, Brockovich says the film is "probably 98% accurate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brockovich.com/the-movie/|title=Erin Brockovich - The Movie|work=Erin Brockovich}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the general facts of the story are accurate, there are some minor discrepancies between actual events and the movie, as well as a number of controversial and disputed issues more fundamental to the case. In the film, Erin Brockovich appears to deliberately use her cleavage to seduce the water board attendant to allow her to access the documents. Brockovich has acknowledged that her cleavage may have had an influence, but denies consciously trying to influence individuals in this way.&lt;ref name= "frog"&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|coauthors=|title=Chasing the Frog - ''Erin Brockovich'' - Questioning the Story|work=Chasing the Frog|pages=|language=|publisher=|date=|url=http://www.chasingthefrog.com/reelfaces/brockovich.php|accessdate=December 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the film, Ed Masry represents Erin Brockovich in the car crash case. In reality, it was his law partner, Jim Vititoe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://masryvititoe.com/erin_brockovich.shtml Masry &amp; Vititoe - Erin Brockovitch resumé] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080212005804/http://www.masryvititoe.com/erin_brockovich.shtml |date=February 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Brockovich had never been Miss Wichita; she had been Miss Pacific Coast. According to Brockovich, this detail was deliberately changed by Soderbergh as he thought it was "cute" to have her be beauty queen of the region from which she came.&lt;ref name=frog/&gt; The "not so good employee" that met Brockovich in the bar was Chuck Ebersohl. He told Erin about the documents that he and Lillian Melendez had been tasked by PG&amp;E to destroy.&lt;ref&gt;Erin Brockovich 'Take It From Me Life's a Struggle But You Can Win' McGraw-Hill copyright 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

The scientific accuracy of the film has been questioned. According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', scientists have suggested that their profession would have more rationally and scientifically evaluated the medical evidence that inspired Brockovich. One scientist who spoke to the paper urged audiences to ask themselves if the science supports the film's assertions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kolata|first=Gina|title=REFLECTIONS; A Hit Movie Is Rated 'F' In Science|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/11/health/reflections-a-hit-movie-is-rated-f-in-science.html|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=January 23, 2013|date=April 11, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Achille Devéria erotism.jpg|thumb|200px|right|&lt;center&gt;In [[Achille Devéria]]'s "libertine watercolor" the explicit [[Cunnilingus|erotic scene]] is taking place clandestinely against the background of a "respectable" party seen at the back&lt;/center&gt;]]
'''Erotic art''' covers any [[Work of art|artistic work]] that is intended to evoke [[Sexual arousal|erotic arousal]] or that depicts scenes of [[human sexuality|sexual activity]]. It is a type of [[erotica]] and includes drawings, engravings, films, paintings, photographs, and sculptures, and writing.

==Definition==
{{details|Erotic literature}}
The definition of erotic art is somewhat subjective, and dependent on context, since perceptions of both what is ''erotic'' and what is ''art'' vary. For example, a sculpture of a [[phallus]] in some cultures may be considered a traditional symbol of potency rather than overtly erotic. Material that is produced to illustrate [[sex education]] may be perceived by others as inappropriately erotic.

A distinction is often made between erotic art and [[pornography]], which also depicts scenes of sexual activity and is intended to evoke erotic arousal, but is not usually considered [[fine art]]. Some draw a distinction based on the work's intent and message: erotic art would be works intended for purposes in addition to arousal, which could be appreciated as art by someone uninterested in their erotic content. [[Supreme Court of the United States|US Supreme Court]] Justice [[Potter Stewart]] famously wrote that the distinction was intuitive, saying about hard-core pornography which would not be legally protected as erotic art, "I know it when I see it"&lt;ref&gt;''Jacobellis v. Ohio'', 378 U.S. 184, 197 (1964).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical==
{{details|History of erotic depictions#Early depictions|Erotic art in Pompeii and Herculaneum}}
Among the oldest surviving examples of erotic depictions are [[Paleolithic]] cave paintings and carvings, but many cultures have created erotic art. Artifacts have been discovered from ancient Mesopotamia depicting explicit heterosexual sex.&lt;ref name="BlackGreen1992"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Black|first1=Jeremy|first2=Anthony|last2=Green|title=Gods, Demons and Symbols of Ancient Mesopotamia: An Illustrated Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=05LXAAAAMAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Inana|publisher=The British Museum Press|year=1992|isbn=0-7141-1705-6|pages=150-152|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NemetNejat"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nemet-Nejat|first=Karen Rhea|date=1998|title=Daily Life in Ancient Mesopotamia|location=Santa Barbara, California|publisher=Greenwood|series=Daily Life|isbn=978-0313294976|page=137|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Glyptic art from the [[Sumer]]ian [[Early Dynastic Period (Mesopotamia)|Early Dynastic Period]] frequently shows scenes of frontal sex in the [[missionary position]].&lt;ref name="BlackGreen1992"/&gt; In Mesopotamian [[Ex-voto|votive plaques]] from the early second millennium BC, the man is usually shown entering the woman from behind while she bends over, drinking [[beer]] through a straw.&lt;ref name="BlackGreen1992"/&gt; [[Assyria|Middle Assyrian]] lead votive [[figurine]]s often represent the man standing and penetrating the woman as she rests on top of an altar.&lt;ref name="BlackGreen1992"/&gt; Scholars have traditionally interpreted all these depictions as scenes of [[Hieros gamos|ritual sex]],&lt;ref name="BlackGreen1992"/&gt; but they are more likely to be associated with the cult of [[Inanna]], the goddess of sex and prostitution.&lt;ref name="BlackGreen1992"/&gt; Many sexually explicit images were found in the temple of Inanna at [[Assur]],&lt;ref name="BlackGreen1992"/&gt; which also contained models of male and female sexual organs,&lt;ref name="BlackGreen1992"/&gt; including stone [[phallus|phalli]], which may have been worn around the neck as an amulet or used to decorate [[Cult image|cult statues]],&lt;ref name="BlackGreen1992"/&gt; and clay models of the female [[vulva]].&lt;ref name="BlackGreen1992"/&gt;

Depictions of sexual intercourse were not part of the general repertory of ancient Egyptian formal art,&lt;ref name="Gay1993"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Robins|first1=Gay|title=Women in Ancient Egypt|date=1993|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0-674-95469-6|pages=189-190|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UTSA88SVHCMC&amp;pg=PA189&amp;dq=Turin+erotic+papyrus&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjMmKPkn8HYAhXLQt8KHePuB48Q6AEIRTAF#v=onepage&amp;q=Turin%20erotic%20papyrus&amp;f=false|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; but rudimentary sketches of heterosexual intercourse have been found on pottery fragments and in graffiti.&lt;ref name="Gay1993"/&gt; The [[Turin Erotic Papyrus]] (Papyrus 55001) is a {{convert|8.5|ft|m}} by {{convert|10|in|cm}} Egyptian papyrus scroll discovered at [[Deir el-Medina]],&lt;ref name=oconnor2001&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Connor|first=David|title=Eros in Egypt|url=http://fontes.lstc.edu/~rklein/Documents/eros_in_egypt.htm|website=Archaeology Odyssey|date=September–October 2001|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gay1993"/&gt; the last two-thirds of which consist of a series of twelve [[Vignette (literature)|vignette]]s showing men and women in various [[sexual position]]s.&lt;ref name=oconnor2001/&gt; The men in the illustrations are "scruffy, balding, short, and paunchy" with exaggeratedly large genitalia&lt;ref name=schmidt2000&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schmidt|first1=Robert A.|last2=Voss|first2=Barbara L.|date=2000|title=Archaeologies of Sexuality|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eSBVQpifqhkC&amp;lpg=PA254&amp;pg=PA254#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Turin%20Papyrus%22&amp;f=false|location=Abingdon-on-Thames, England|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-22366-9|page=254|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; and do not conform to Egyptian standards of physical attractiveness,&lt;ref name=schmidt2000/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gay1993"/&gt; but the women are [[nubile]]&lt;ref name=schmidt2000/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gay1993"/&gt; and they are shown with objects from traditional erotic [[iconography]], such as [[convolvulus]] leaves and, in some scenes, they are even holding items traditionally associated with [[Hathor]], the goddess of love, such as [[lotus flower]]s, monkeys, and [[sistra]].&lt;ref name=schmidt2000/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gay1993"/&gt; The scroll was probably painted in the Ramesside period (1292-1075 BC)&lt;ref name=oconnor2001/&gt; and its high artistic quality indicates that was produced for a wealthy audience.&lt;ref name=oconnor2001/&gt; No other similar scrolls have yet been discovered.&lt;ref name="Gay1993"/&gt;

The ancient [[Greeks]] painted sexual scenes on their ceramics, many of them famous for being some of the earliest depictions of same-sex relations and pederasty, and there are numerous sexually explicit paintings on the walls of ruined Roman buildings in [[Pompeii]]. The [[Moche (culture)|Moche]] of [[Peru]] in [[South America]] are another ancient people that sculpted explicit scenes of sex into their pottery.&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, M., Leslie, J. &amp; Butts, S. (2005) ''Pornography: the Secret History of Civilization'' [DVD], Koch Vision.&lt;/ref&gt; There is an entire gallery devoted to pre-Columbian erotic ceramics ([[Moche (culture)|Moche]] culture) in [[Lima]] at the [[Larco Museum]].

Additionally, there has been a long tradition of erotic painting in Eastern cultures. In [[Japan]], for example, [[Shunga (art)|shunga]] appeared in the 13th century and continued to grow in popularity until the late 19th century when photography was invented.&lt;ref name = shunga&gt;{{cite web| title = Shunga| publisher = Japanese art net and architecture users system| year = 2001| url = http://www.aisf.or.jp/%7Ejaanus/deta/s/shunga.htm| accessdate = 2006-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the erotic art of [[China]] reached its popular peak during the latter part of the [[Ming Dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;Bertholet, L.

(1997) "Dreams of Spring: Erotic Art in China," in: ''Bertholet Collection'', Pepin Press (October, 1997) {{ISBN|90-5496-039-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[India]], the famous [[Kama Sutra]] is an ancient sex manual that is still popularly read throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;Daniélou, A., trans.

In Europe, starting with the [[Renaissance]], there was a tradition of producing [[erotica]] for the amusement of the aristocracy. In the early 16th century, the text ''[[I Modi]]'' was a [[woodcut]] album created by the designer [[Giulio Romano]], the engraver [[Marcantonio Raimondi]] and the poet [[Pietro Aretino]]. In 1601 [[Michelangelo Merisi|Caravaggio]] painted the "[[Amor Vincit Omnia (Caravaggio)|Amor Vincit Omnia]]," for the collection of the Marquis Vincenzo Giustiniani.

An erotic cabinet, ordered by [[Catherine the Great]], seems to have been adjacent to her suite of rooms in the [[Gatchina Palace]]. The furniture was highly eccentric with tables that had large penises for legs. Penises and vaginas were carved on the furniture. The walls were covered in erotic art. The rooms and the furniture were seen in 1941 by two Wehrmacht-officers but they seem to have vanished since then.&lt;ref&gt;Igorʹ Semenovich Kon and James Riordan, ''Sex and Russian Society'' page 18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=http://www.trouw.nl/tr/nl/4512/Cultuur/archief/article/detail/1775415/2003/12/06/Het-Geheim-van-Catherina-de-Grote.dhtml|title=Het Geheim van Catherina de Grote|newspaper=Trouw|author=Peter Dekkers|date=6 December 2003|trans-title=The Secret of Catherine the Great|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; A documentary by Peter Woditsch suggests that the cabinet was in the [[Peterhof Palace]] and not in Gatchina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Secret of Catherine the Great|url=http://www.deproductie.nl/en/films/het-geheim-van-catherina-de-grote/|last=Woditsch|first=Peter|website=De Productie|accessdate=8 July 2014}} Includes trailer of the documentary by Peter Woditsch.&lt;/ref&gt;

The tradition was continued by other, more modern painters, such as [[Jean-Honoré Fragonard|Fragonard]], [[Gustave Courbet|Courbet]], [[Jean-François Millet|Millet]], [[Balthus]], [[Picasso]], [[Edgar Degas]], [[Toulouse-Lautrec]] and [[Egon Schiele]]. Schiele served time in jail and had several works destroyed by the authorities for offending contemporary mores with his depictions of nude girls.

By the 20th century, photography became the most common medium for erotic art. Publishers like [[Taschen]] mass-produced erotic illustrations and [[erotic photography]].

==Modern==
[[File:Ciągliński Symbolic dance.jpg|thumb|150px|left|''Symbolic dance'' by [[Jan Ciągliński]], late 19th-century subtle [[lesbian]] erotica ([[National Museum, Warsaw|National Museum]] in [[Warsaw]]).]]
Today, erotic artists thrive, although in some circles, much of the genre is still not as well accepted as the more standard genres of art such as portraiture and landscape. During the last few centuries, society has broadened its view of what can be considered as art and several new styles developed during the 19th century such as [[Impressionism]] and [[Realism (visual arts)|Realism]]. This has given today's artists a broad variety of genres from which to choose, including; [[Fantasy art|fantasy]], [[Pinup art|pinup]], [[Horror fiction|horror]], [[Fetish art|fetish]], [[Adult comics|comics]], [[anime]], [[hentai]], and many other niche genres all with erotic elements.

Classic "war-era" pin-ups like the works of [[Alberto Vargas]], [[Gil Elvgren]] and [[Baron Von Lind]], are still as popular as their contemporaries: [[Bunny Yeager]], [[Greg Hildebrandt]], [[Olivia De Berardinis]], [[Hajime Sorayama]], [[Aslan (artist)|Alain Aslan]], and [[List of pin-up artists|others]].

The acceptance and popularity of erotic art has pushed the genre into mainstream pop-culture and has created many famous icons. [[Frank Frazetta]], [[Luis Royo]], [[Boris Vallejo]], [[Chris Achilleos]], and [[Clyde Caldwell]] are among the artists whose work has been widely distributed.  The Guild of Erotic Artists were formed in 2002 to bring together a body of like minded individuals whose sole purpose was to express themselves and promote the sensual art of erotica for the modern age.&lt;ref&gt;For an overview, see Eberhard and Phyllis Kronhausen: ''Erotic Art.'' Carroll &amp; Graf Publishers, [[New York City|New York]] 1993, {{ISBN|0-88184-970-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2010 and 2015 [[sexologist]] and [[gallerist]] [[Laura Henkel]], curator of the [[Erotic Heritage Museum]] and the Sin City Gallery, organised 12 Inches of Sin, an exhibition focussing on art that expresses a diverse view of sexuality and challenging ideas of high and low art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thecreatorsproject.vice.com/blog/las-vegas-sexologist-art|title=One Sexologist’s Quest to Stimulate Las Vegas’ Art Scene|website=The Creators Project|author=Alyssa Buffenstein|date=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 Henkel collaborated with former [[MoMA]] curator and art historian Rosa JH Berland to create the Modern Provocateur Manifesto, that describes artwork that is about human sexuality.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

==Legal standards==
Whether or not an instance of erotic art is [[obscene]] depends on the standards of the jurisdisction and community in which it is displayed.

In the [[United States]], the 1973 ruling of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in ''[[Miller v. California]]'' established a three-tiered [[Miller test|test]] to determine what was obscene—and thus not protected, versus what was merely erotic and thus protected by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].

Delivering the opinion of the court, Chief Justice [[Warren Burger]] wrote, &lt;blockquote&gt;
The basic guidelines for the trier of fact must be: (a) whether 'the average person, applying contemporary community standards' would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest, (b) whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law; and (c) whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.&lt;ref&gt;''Miller v. California'', 413 U.S. 15, 24 (1973).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As this is still much more vague than other judicial tests within U.S. jurisprudence, it has not reduced the conflicts that often result, especially from the ambiguities concerning what the "contemporary community standards" are. Similar difficulties in distinguishing between erotica and obscenity have been found in other legal systems.

The '''Esquiline Treasure''' is an ancient Roman silver treasure that was found in 1793 on the [[Esquiline Hill]] in Rome. The hoard is considered an important example of late antique silver work from the 4th century AD, probably about 380 for the major pieces.&lt;ref&gt;Projecta; Cameron argues for about this date for the Projecta pieces, throughout; Shelton argues for "about 330-370", in Shelton (1985), 147&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1866, 57 objects, representing the great majority of the treasure, have been in the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?place=32644&amp;plaA=32644-3-2 British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Two of the most important objects in the treasure are the ornate silver-gilt engraved boxes known as the ''Projecta Casket'' and the ''Muse Casket''. The treasure was part of the belongings of a wealthy Roman household of high social status, which can probably be identified. The collection includes 8 plates (4 circular and 4 rectangular), a fluted dish, a ewer inscribed for "Pelegrina", a flask with embossed scenes, an [[amphora]], 6 sets of horse trappings, with furniture fittings including 4 [[tyche]] figures representing the 4 main cities of the [[Roman Empire]]: Rome, [[Constantinople]], [[Antioch]] and [[Alexandria]], two hands clenching bannisters, and an assortment of jewellery.&lt;ref&gt;Kent and Painter, 44; Projecta and other BM pages; see External links for how to reach these&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a number of large late Roman hoards have been discovered, most are from the fringes of the empire (such as [[List of Roman hoards in Britain|Roman Britain]]), and very few objects from the period can be presumed to have been made by silversmiths in Rome itself, giving the Esquiline Treasure a "special significance".&lt;ref&gt;Kent and Painter, 18-19, 44 quoted&lt;/ref&gt;  This major hoard is displayed in room 41 of the British Museum alongside the [[Carthage Treasure]] and near the British finds of the [[Mildenhall Treasure]], [[Hoxne Hoard]], [[Water Newton Treasure]] and the [[Corbridge Lanx]]. It has been observed that the majority of the major surviving late Roman silver hoards are in the British Museum.&lt;ref&gt;Kent and Painter, 9; at the start of his "Late-Roman silver plate: a reply to Alan Cameron" in the ''Journal of Roman Archaeology'' 6, 1993, Kenneth Painter lists (before the discovery of the [[Sevso Treasure]], which he implies should join the list) "the 5 surviving major hoards" of late Roman silver, of which four (Esquiline, Carthage, Mildenhall and the earlier Chaourse) are in the British Museum. The other was the [[Kaiseraugst Treasure]] in [[Augst]], Switzerland, [http://www.journalofromanarch.com/v6_first%20pages/lo-res%20PDFs/v6_06%20Painter.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery of the Treasure==
[[Image:Esquiline Treasure (4).JPG|350px|thumb|left|Lid of the Projecta Casket]]
In the summer of 1793 workers encountered a large collection of silver objects during excavation work at the foot of the Esquiline Hill in Rome, which had been the area favoured by the Roman aristocracy for their houses throughout the Roman period. These items were found in the ruins of a Roman building, which was at that time in the premises of the monastery of San Francesco di Paola in [[Rome]]. The first official record of the finds was made one year after their discovery by the famous Italian classical archaeologist and later head of the Capitoline Museum [[Ennio Quirino Visconti]].&lt;ref&gt;Kent and Painter, 44; Projecta and other BM pages&lt;/ref&gt;

The treasure passed through many hands before eventually being acquired by the French collector and one-time ambassador to Rome the [[Pierre Louis Jean Casimir de Blacas|Duc de Blacas]]. In 1866 his collection was sold in its entirety to the British Museum.&lt;ref&gt;Kent and Painter, 44; Projecta and other BM pages&lt;/ref&gt; However, two other items in the treasure can be found in the [[Petit Palais|Musee du Petit Palais]] in Paris (a highly decorated ''trulla'' or saucepan),&lt;ref&gt;Kent and Painter, #94&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Naples National Archaeological Museum|Museo Nazionale]] in Naples (a jug in the form of a women's head).

==The Projecta Casket==
The so-called '''Projecta Casket''' (M&amp;ME 1866,12-29,1) is one of the most famous and magnificent examples of silver craftsmanship from [[late antiquity]] in Rome. It is partially [[gilding|gilded]] to highlight some areas, and was made by the [[repoussé]] technique - that is the ornamented relief was achieved by means of pressing or pushing back the metal surface. The box is 55.9&amp;nbsp;cm long, 28.6&amp;nbsp;cm high and 43.2&amp;nbsp;cm wide and has a weight of 8.2&amp;nbsp;kg. The base of the box has swinging handles at each end.&lt;ref&gt;Projecta&lt;/ref&gt;

The five panels on the lid of the box represent three mythological scenes, a double portrait and a bathing scene. On the top panel of the lid are half-length figures of a man and woman within a wreath held by standing [[erotes]] (or [[putti]] in modern terms) and an inscription which reads: "SECVNDE ET PROIECTA VIVATIS IN CHRI[STO] ('Secundus and Projecta, may you live in Christ').&lt;ref&gt;Kent and Painter, #88; Projecta&lt;/ref&gt; The attire of the two figures is clearly that of an affluent couple from late antiquity. The woman is wearing a long-sleeved tunic with a large necklace. In her hands she holds a papyrus roll. The man is in a long-sleeved tunic that he wears under a [[chlamys]].

The four panels of the box itself depict bathing and dressing scenes, representing the preparations for a grand Roman wedding. These are placed between columns joined by alternating arches and bottomless [[pediment]]s, all under a [[frieze]] with scrolling vines.  In one scene, Projecta is shown sitting on an ornate chair holding a decorated box similar in shape to the Muse Casket. She wears a long-sleeved tunic under a [[colobium]] or short-sleeved tunic.&lt;ref&gt;Kent and Painter, #88; Projecta&lt;/ref&gt;  A smaller inscription on the front rim of the lid gives the weight as "XXII-III", meaning "[Pondo] XXII,III [Unciae],S[emuncia]" or "Twenty-two pounds, three and one-half ounces" in [[Roman pound|Roman units]].&lt;ref&gt;Projecta, catalogue database&lt;/ref&gt;

The casket has travelled abroad to several international exhibitions: New York in 1977-1978, [[Rimini]] in 1996, [[New Dehli]] in 1997, [[Mumbai]] in 1998, [[Trier]] in 2007, Paris in 2009 and most recently Chicago in 2012-13.&lt;ref&gt;Projecta, catalogue database&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Muse Casket==
[[Image:Esquiline Treasure (3).JPG|thumb|left|300px|The "Muse Casket"]]
Another ornate object in the treasure is the Muse Casket (M&amp;ME 1866,12-29,2), which is a domed silver box, suspended on three chains. It is 25.4&amp;nbsp;cm high and 33&amp;nbsp;cm across. The outside of the box is decorated with [[relief]] panels showing eight of the [[Muse|Nine Muses]] alternating with decorative motifs. Inside the casket were found a set of five silver lidded bottles, or "four identical silver canisters and one silver flask" in the centre.&lt;ref&gt;Muse Casket in collection database&lt;/ref&gt;  These were presumably to hold perfumed oils for toiletries.  An apparently identical casket is carried by a female servant on the back panel of the Projecta Casket, suggesting that both were commissioned for the same wedding.&lt;ref&gt;Kent and Painter, #89&lt;/ref&gt;

This casket is also well-travelled, exhibited in New York in 1977-1978, Rome in 2000, Milan in 2003, Paris in 2009 and most recently Chicago in 2012-13.&lt;ref&gt;catalogue database&lt;/ref&gt;

==Projecta and the Turcii==
The British Museum follows Kathleen J. Shelton in dating the treasure as a whole to the period 330-370; Shelton favours a period of some 20 to 25 years within that range, with the major objects from the same workshop, and probably for more than one generation within a family.&lt;ref&gt;"Muse"; Shelton, 147-148. The British Museum website in January 2014 follows the "Damasus" dating of "about 380" for the Projecta Casket, but Shelton's "330-370" for the Muse Casket and other items.&lt;/ref&gt;  
Current research suggests that the Projecta Casket and some other items in the treasure (but probably not all of them) were a wedding gift to the newly married couple Projecta and Secundus.&lt;ref&gt;Projecta&lt;/ref&gt; Projecta has been associated with an [[epitaph]] for a woman of that name who died in 383, shortly before her 17th birthday, written by [[Pope Damasus I]] (r. 366-84) that was once displayed in the church of [[San Martino ai Monti]], close to where the find was made. Though only nine lines long, and described by [[Alan Cameron (classical scholar)|Alan Cameron]] as "typically lame and frigid" (for a composition by Damasus) and "a tissue of tags and clichés shakily strung together and barely squeezed into the meter", the epitaph creates a number of puzzles and has generated much scholarly discussion.&lt;ref&gt;Cameron, 136-139 being his contribution; 136 and 137 are quoted in turn; Shelton, 148-150 disagrees with him&lt;/ref&gt;  The epitaph reads:

[[Image:Arte tardoantica da roma, brocca di 'pelegrina' in niello, IV sec.jpg|thumb|The Pelegrina Ewer; her name can be seen at the widest point, across the three "dimples" to the right]]

The translation here of "PROIECTAE FVERAT PRIMO QVAE IVNCTA MARITO" as "Projecta, who had been the wife of Primus" continues to be hotly discussed; ''primus'', meaning "first" was a Roman male name, but other possibilities are that Projecta had a "first" husband, or that her unnamed husband was ''primus'' or "first" in the complimentary sense of being "the tops".  Alan Cameron, who supports the Projecta of the epitaph being the wife of L. Turcius Secundus and the owner of the casket, sees ''primo'' as punning wordplay by Damasus - "second" was actually "first" in quality; he says this would be typical of Damasus's style.  Kathleen Shelton disagrees, seeing no connection between two different women called Projecta, one of the epitaph and the other of the casket, and supporting "Primus" as the name of the husband in the epitaph.&lt;ref&gt;Their two articles referenced here deal at length with these questions, and the arguments of each other.&lt;/ref&gt;

The epitaph for Projecta gives her father's name as Florus, who may be the important and pious Iberian official of that name who was close to [[Theodosius I]] (himself Iberian), and given great appointments at just this period.  He was part of a coterie of Iberian Christians close to the emperor, most seemingly related, which included Pope Damasus.&lt;ref&gt;Cameron, 142-143&lt;/ref&gt;  Florus may be the figure of that name depicted with Damasus and a Simon and Peter in a [[gold glass]] cup in the [[Vatican Museums]] and in another with Simon (Simon appears in a further glass with Damasus), suggesting "a circle of friends, or at least associates".&lt;ref&gt;Grig, 210-211&lt;/ref&gt;

Two pieces of silver plate, a rectangular dish and a circular one were inscribed with a monogram that has been translated as standing for Projecta Turci. Based on this evidence, some scholars have suggested that Projecta was married to L. Turcius Secundus, and given her age this must have been not long before 383. However, not all the monograms seem to relate to this couple, and it may well be that the treasure represented the family silver accumulated over more than one generation. A ewer in the treasure is inscribed with the female name Pelegrina, but her identity has not been the subject of equal speculation, as there is no other evidence to go on. Another couple of a Turcius and Pelegrina has been tentatively suggested, though how their dates would relate to Projecta and Secundus is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;Cameron, 135-136; Shelton (1985), 147-148&lt;/ref&gt;

While Projecta was evidently Christian, her husband, if he was L. Turcius Secundus, was a member of a prominent family many of whom remained pagans until the end of the century.&lt;ref&gt;Projecta; Cameron, 142-144; Shelton, 152&lt;/ref&gt; The ivory [[Symmachi–Nicomachi diptych]] from the same period and milieu in Rome shows pagan iconography; some 70 years after the conversion of [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]] the old religion still had supporters in the Roman elite.  The four ''tyche'' of the main cities of the empire suggest they were made for the posts of a great official's chair or litter; members of the Turcii held several such positions. Cameron claims that the helmet of Constantinople is a form not found on ''tyche'' figures of that city before 380, when the see of Constantinople was suddenly raised to be second to Rome, above older ones such as Alexandria.&lt;ref&gt;Cameron, 140-141; disputed by Shelton, 152&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that the treasure was buried at the Turcii house on the Esquiline Hill just before the [[Visigothic]] attack on Rome by [[Alaric I]] in 410 AD.&lt;ref&gt;Kent and Painter, 44; Projecta&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christian/Pagan Iconography==
In spite of the Christian inscription on the Projecta Casket, the [[iconography]] of the figurative decoration of the treasure is purely [[Ancient Roman religion|pagan]], a common mixture in Roman metalwork from the period to about 350, when [[Early Christian art]] had not yet devised iconography for essentially secular decoration.&lt;ref&gt;Kent and Painter, 17&lt;/ref&gt; Three sides of the Projecta Casket's lid are decorated with pagan mythological motifs - these include the deity [[Aphrodite|Venus]] on a cockleshell, [[nereid]]s (sea-nymphs) riding a [[ketos]] (a dragon-like sea monster) and a [[hippocamp]] (a monster with the front quarters of a horse and the tail of a fish).&lt;ref&gt;Projecta in collection database&lt;/ref&gt; The mixture of Christian and pagan inscriptions and symbols may have been a compromise reflecting the affiliations of the bride and groom's families, described in the previous section.&lt;ref&gt;Projecta, catalogue database&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fiona Cumming''' (9 October 1937 – 1 January 2015) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[television director]], noted for her work on the [[BBC]] [[television series]], ''[[Doctor Who]]'', during the show's [[Fifth Doctor]] era.&lt;ref name=kasterborous&gt;{{cite news|first=Jonathan|last=Appleton |title=Doctor Who Director Fiona Cumming, 1937-2015|url=http://www.kasterborous.com/2015/01/doctor-director-fiona-cumming-1937-2015|work=[[Kasterborous]]|date=10 January 2015|accessdate=24 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=scotlandnow&gt;{{cite news|first=Kenny|last=Smith|title=Doctor Who: Meet the Scots director who worked with five different Time Lords in the series|url=http://www.scotlandnow.dailyrecord.co.uk/lifestyle/doctor-who-meet-scots-director-4492303|work=Scotland Now|date=25 October 2014|accessdate=18 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her credits included the 1982 episode, ''[[Castrovalva (Doctor Who)|Castrovalva]]'', the [[Doctor Who (season 19)|Season 19 premiere]] which marked the debut of [[Peter Davison]] as the show's fifth [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|Doctor]].&lt;ref name=kasterborous/&gt; Her other work with the show included ''[[Snakedance]]'' in January 1983 and ''[[Enlightenment (Doctor Who)|Enlightenment]]'' in March 1983 for [[Doctor Who (season 20)|season 20]].&lt;ref name=kasterborous/&gt; Cumming shot much of the 1984 serial, ''[[Planet of Fire]]'', on location in [[Lanzarote]], [[Canary Islands]].&lt;ref name=scotlandnow/&gt;

She transitioned from [[acting]] to [[television production]] in 1964. She had initially applied to the BBC and taught school in Scotland before breaking into production. She recalled her entry into the industry in a 2014 interview, telling Scotland Now, "I had applied to the BBC in 1964 when they were getting ready for [[BBC Two|BBC2]], and I had been accepted - but they lost my file and because I had a teaching degree, I came back up to Glasgow and started teaching at [[Bellahouston Academy]]. I can remember in 1963 when the kids came in, talking about this brilliant TV show they had seen the Saturday night before, and I said, 'What do you mean, it's set in a police box?'...Then in 1964 I went to the BBC as a relief assistant floor manager, where you were slotted into various programmes. I was doing the twice-weekly soaps Compact and Swizzlewick, and the first time I was moved on to something different it was ''Doctor Who''."&lt;ref name=scotlandnow/&gt;

In 1965, she was hired as an assistant [[floor manager]] on the set of ''[[The Massacre of St Bartholomew's Eve]]''.&lt;ref name=scotlandnow/&gt; "I was put onto The Massacre in 1965 - so it's now 48 years since I first worked on ''Doctor Who''. [[Peter Purves]] was William Hartnell's assistant at that time and the director was [[Paddy Russell]], who had such a great reputation," she recalled in 2014.&lt;ref name=scotlandnow/&gt; Cumming later worked as a [[production assistant]] for several episodes of ''Doctor Who'' during the 1960s and 1970s, including ''[[The Highlanders (Doctor Who)|The Highlanders]]'', ''[[The Seeds of Death]]'', and ''[[The Mutants]]''.&lt;ref name=kasterborous/&gt;

In 1974, Cumming was hired as a staff television director for the BBC.&lt;ref name=kasterborous/&gt; She directed episode's for some of the BBC leading dramatic series during the 1970s, including ''[[Angels (TV series)|Angels]]'', ''[[Play for Today]]'', ''[[Z-Cars]]'', and ''[[The Omega Factor]]'', a short-lived series which aired in 1979.&lt;ref name=kasterborous/&gt; In 1980, Cumming directed two episodes of ''[[Blake's 7]]'' during the show's third season, ''Sarcophagus'' and ''Rumours of Death''.&lt;ref name=kasterborous/&gt;

Cumming was booked to direct ''[[The Ultimate Evil]]'' during ''Doctor Who'''s [[Doctor Who (season 23)|23rd season]] in 1986, but the production was cancelled when the show was put on [[Hiatus (television)|hiatus]].&lt;ref name=kasterborous/&gt; While she did not direct additional episodes on ''Doctor Who'', she maintained a working relationship with the show 's producer, [[John Nathan-Turner]], and collaborated with him at [[Teynham Productions]].&lt;ref name=kasterborous/&gt;

In 1988, Cumming made a cameo appearance as a tourist at Windsor Castle in ''[[Silver Nemesis]]'' for Doctor Who's [[Doctor Who (season 25)|25th season]].&lt;ref name=doctorwhonews/&gt; She also oversaw the re-edit of her 1983 serial, ''[[Enlightenment (Doctor Who)|Enlightenment]]'', for its re-release as part of the Black Guardian Trilogy DVD box set in 2009 as well as the re-edit of her 1984 serial, ''[[Planet of Fire]]'' for its re-release as part of the Kamelion Tales DVD box set in 2010.&lt;ref name=kasterborous/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2431">'''"Four Abstract Classists"''' was a landmark exhibition organized by [[Jules Langsner]] in 1959. The show featured the work of [[Karl Benjamin]], [[Lorser Feitelson]], [[Frederick Hammersley]], and [[John McLaughlin (artist)|John McLaughlin]]. The term “abstract classicists” was coined in 1959 by Langsner to define these four southern California painters.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theartstory.org/movement-hard-edge-painting.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

__TOC__

==Exhibition==
The exhibition opened at the San Francisco Museum of Art (now the [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]]), and then travelled to the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]] in Exposition Park (prior to LACMA’s existence as an independent art museum). Renamed “West Coast [[Hard-edge]],” the revised version later traveled to the institute of Contemporary Art in London and Queen’s University in Belfast, Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lacma.org/art/exhibition/four-abstract-classicists |title=Four Abstract Classicists |publisher=LACMA.org |date= |accessdate=2015-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the exhibition catalog, Langsner described Abstract Classicist painting as "Hard-edge painting" in which "color and shape are one and the same entity.

"Four Abstract Classicists reveals, in retrospect, not merely four senior moderns who reduced their painting to precise, flat profundities, but a current of sensibility in the esthetic climate of Los Angeles," critic [[Peter Plagens]] wrote in 1974. As he saw it, the hard-edge style rose from Los Angeles’ "desert air, youthful cleanliness, spatial expanse, architectural tradition".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lacma.org/node/12498 |title=What’s in a Name?

In 2014 she completed a 68-date UK/Ireland tour and has had multiple off-West End London runs at the [[Tricycle Theatre]], the [[Hackney Empire]], and the [[Soho Theatre]].

==Comedy==
In 2000, Martinez became the first female comic to win the prestigious Daily Telegraph Open Mic Award at the Edinburgh Festival.

In 2003 she was listed in ''[[The Observer]]'' as one of the 50 funniest acts in British comedy.

Martinez has performed sell-out shows in many countries including Australia, Canada, Ireland, [[Malaysia]], Singapore, South Africa, the United States, performing at [[Caroline's on Broadway]], [[92YTribeca]] and the [[Upright Citizens Brigade Theater]] (all in New York City), and the [[Laugh Factory]] and the [[Comedy Store]] (both in Los Angeles). She also performed at the 2008 [[World Economic Forum]] in [[Davos]], [[Switzerland]], alongside [[Emma Thompson]].

Her tour 'WHAT THE **** IS NORMAL?!' clocked up over 130 dates around the world – winning a Fringe Media Network Award at the Edinburgh Fringe, as well as being nominated for Best Show at Dave's Leicester Comedy Festival and at the Perth Festival, Australia.

In 2014, her best-selling book 'WHAT THE **** IS NORMAL?! was published by [[Random House]] to critical acclaim. It has been nominated for the Chortle Comedy 'Best Book' Award and The Bread And Roses Radical Publishing Award.

==Television and radio==
Before becoming a comedian Martinez appeared in the [[BBC]] children's drama series ''[[Grange Hill]]'' from 1994–1998, and has acted in other drama series such as ''[[Holby City]]''.

In August 2005 she appeared in the BBC sitcom ''[[Extras (TV series)|Extras]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[List of Extras episodes#Series 1 .282005.29]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2008 Martinez made global headlines when (live on [[Channel 4 News]]) she became the first [[Olympic torch]] bearer to pull out of the London relay in protest over China's treatment of Tibet.

In April 2009 she appeared on the [[BBC Radio 4]] stand-up comedy show, [[4 Stands Up]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00f4ptw |title=BBC Radio 4 – 4 Stands Up |publisher=BBC |date=7 May 2009 |accessdate=20 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012 she made her debut appearance on BBC Radio 4's topical panel show ''[[The News Quiz]]'', alongside regulars [[Jeremy Hardy]] and [[Sandi Toksvig]]. She appeared on ''The News Quiz'' again in January and July 2013.

Martinez has become a regular face on television, including appearances on ''[[The Frank Skinner Show]],'' in [[Ricky Gervais]] and [[Stephen Merchant]]'s comedy series ''[[Extras (TV series)|Extras]]'', ''[[Russell Howard's Good News]]'' [[BBC Three]], [[The Jonathan Ross Show]], ITV's [[Loose Women]], ''[[Free Speech]]'' BBC3, [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]]'s ''[[The Saturday Night Show]]'' with [[Brendan O'Connor (media personality)|Brendan O'Connor]], ''[[Adam Hills Tonight]]'' and ''Spicks &amp; Specks''.

==Campaigner==
On 8 December 2012, Martinez launched a campaign ''War on Welfare''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefedonline.org.uk/disability-in-the-news/martinez-brings-star-quality-to-fresh-assault-on-coalition-s-war-on-welfare |title=Martinez brings star quality to fresh assault on coalition's 'war on welfare' – Disability in the News |publisher=The Fed Online |accessdate=21 January 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204013255/http://www.thefedonline.org.uk/disability-in-the-news/martinez-brings-star-quality-to-fresh-assault-on-coalition-s-war-on-welfare |archivedate=4 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; which pledged to get 100,000 supporters to sign a petition calling for an end to government cuts for [[disability benefits]] and an independent impact assessment of the government's welfare changes. The petition attracted 5,000 signatures in the first 48 hours,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekklesia.co.uk/node/17717 |title=Welfare petition aims for ten thousand backers by New Year's Day |publisher=Ekklesia |accessdate=20 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and achieved its target of 100,000 supporters on 30 November 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/war-welfare-petition-100000-sign-2870513|title=100,000 sign War on Welfare petition asking for assessment of cuts to the sick and disabled|first=Steve|last=Robson|date=30 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An outspoken opponent of welfare reform by the government, she uses her public profile to raise issues about disability and fight for a fairer system. Martinez said: "As a disabled person in the media, I want to help give this issue a voice. It's morally wrong for the government to target those in need instead of saving money by targeting the real causes of this crisis – and close tax loopholes and regulate the financial sector. To me, it's a human rights issue."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.update.org.uk/news-detail.php?page=563|title=Disability Information Scotland|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130423211500/http://www.update.org.uk/news-detail.php?page=563|archivedate=23 April 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She is patron of a number of charities.&lt;ref name=Personally&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.personallyspeakingbureau.com/speaker/francesca-martinez/ |title=Francesca Martinez – Personally Speaking Bureau|accessdate=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CAF&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cafamily.org.uk/what-we-do/our-team/|title=Our Team – Contact a Family|accessdate=16 May 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160604052159/http://www.cafamily.org.uk/what-we-do/our-team|archivedate=4 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She has challenged the government in numerous TV interviews, including on ''[[Newsnight]]'' and ''[[This Week (BBC TV series)|This Week]]''.

Martinez has become a respected social commentator, speaking at meetings and demos across the UK, as well as being a key part of the People's Assembly Against Austerity.

In 2015 she helped organise [[This Changes Everything (book)|This Changes Everything]], a one-day event on climate and social justice, with [[Naomi Klein]], [[Russell Brand]], and many other speakers. The event was streamed globally and aimed to kick-start a movement to unify the left against climate change.

In 2013 she was nominated for a Women in Public Life Award, and won the Public Affairs Achiever of the Year Award. In April 2014 she was named as one of Britain's most influential women in the BBC Woman's Hour power list 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Woman's Hour Power List 2014 – Game Changers|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03zy4m5/profiles|publisher=BBC Radio 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was also nominated for Red Magazine's Woman of the Year Award 2014 and for a European Diversity Hero of the Year Award 2014.

In July 2015, Martinez endorsed [[Jeremy Corbyn]]'s [[Jeremy Corbyn Labour Party leadership campaign, 2015|campaign]] in the [[Labour Party (UK) leadership election, 2015|Labour Party leadership election]].&lt;ref name="newstatesman"&gt;{{cite news |last=Bush|first=Stephen|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2015/07/25-campaign-groups-and-activists-back-jeremy-corbyn-labour-leader|title=25 campaign groups and activists back Jeremy Corbyn for Labour leader|work=[[New Statesman]]|date=29 July 2015|accessdate=15 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, along with numerous other celebrities, she toured the UK to support Corbyn's bid to become [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]].&lt;ref name="jc4pmtour"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jc4pmtour.com/|title=#JC4PM|publisher=jc4pmtour|date=28 July 2015|accessdate=15 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite news |last=Wilkinson|first=Michael|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/Jeremy_Corbyn/12134051/Celebrities-to-tour-Britain-in-Jeremy-Corbyn-For-Prime-Minister-musical-show.html|title=Celebrities to tour Britain in 'Jeremy Corbyn For Prime Minister' musical show|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=1 February 2016|accessdate=15 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2016, she performed at the Keep Corbyn rally in Brighton in support of [[Jeremy Corbyn]]'s [[Jeremy Corbyn Labour Party leadership campaign, 2016|campaign]] in the [[Labour Party (UK) leadership election, 2016|Labour Party leadership election]].&lt;ref name="doncasterfreepress"&gt;{{cite news |last=Burke|first=Darren|url=https://www.doncasterfreepress.co.uk/news/tv-star-comedians-line-up-for-jeremy-corbyn-rally-in-doncaster-1-8090226|title=TV star comedians line up for Jeremy Corbyn rally in Doncaster|work= |location=Doncaster|publisher=''[[Doncaster Free Press]]''|date=26 August 2016|accessdate=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''French Colonial''' is a style of architecture used by the [[French colonial empire|French during colonization]]. Many former French colonies, especially those in Southeast Asia, have previously been reluctant to promote their colonial architecture as an asset for tourism; however, in recent times, the new generation of local authorities has somewhat "embraced" the architecture and advertise it.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eng.hochiminhcity.gov.vn/abouthcmcity/Lists/Posts/Post.aspx?CategoryId=10&amp;ItemID=5440&amp;PublishedDate=2005-03-13T11:19:09Z/&lt;/ref&gt; French Colonial architecture has a long history, beginning in North America in 1604 and being most active in the Western Hemisphere (Caribbean, Guiana, Canada, Louisiana) until the 19th century, when the French turned their attention more to Africa, Asia, and the Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mqup.ca/architecture-and-urbanism-in-the-french-atlantic-empire-products-9780773553149.php&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Canada==
[[French colonization of the Americas|French settlements in Canada]] date back to the mid-16th century and until the annexion of Quebec by the British Crown after the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)]], [[New France|French Canada]] alongside with Louisiana, was immensely prosperous. Hence the abundant architectural legacy from that period particularly in [[Quebec City]] but also in [[Montreal]]. Most buildings constructed during the French colonial period utilized a heavy timber frame of logs installed vertically on a sill, ''[[poteaux-sur-sol]]'', or into the earth, ''[[Post in ground|poteaux-en-terre]]''.  An infill of lime mortar or clay mixed with small stones ([[pierrotage]]) or a mixture of mud, moss, and animal hair ([[bousillage]]) was used to pack between the logs.  Many times the infill would later be replaced with [[brick]].  This method of construction was used in the [[Illinois Country]] as well as Louisiana. General characteristics of a French Colonial dwelling included a raised [[basement]] which would support the floor of the home's primary living quarters.  Exterior stairs were another common element; the stairs would often climb up to a distinctive, full-length [[veranda]] or "gallery," on a home's [[façade]]. The roof over the veranda was normally part of the overall roof. French Colonial roofs were either a steep [[Hip roof|hipped roof]], with a [[dormer]] or dormers, or a side-gabled roof.  The veranda or gallery was often accessed via [[French doors]].  French Colonial homes in the [[Southern United States|American South]] commonly had [[stucco]]ed exterior walls.&lt;ref name=bigolin&gt;Bigolin, Steve.

==In the United States==
French Colonial was one of four domestic architectural styles that developed during the colonial period in what would become the [[United States]]. The other styles were [[Colonial Georgian]], [[Dutch Colonial]], and [[Spanish Colonial]].  French Colonial developed in the settlements of the [[Illinois Country]] and [[Louisiana (New France)|French Louisiana]].  It is believed to have been primarily influenced by the building styles of [[French Canada]] and the [[Caribbean]].&lt;ref&gt;Gamble, Robert ''Historic architecture in Alabama: a guide to styles and types, 1810-1930'', page 180. Tuscaloosa, Alabama: The University of Alabama Press, 1990. {{ISBN|0-8173-1134-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It had its beginnings in 1699 with the establishment of French Louisiana but continued to be built after [[Spain]] assumed control of the colonial territory in 1763. Styles of building that evolved during the French colonial period include the [[Creole cottage]], [[Buildings and architecture of New Orleans#Creole townhouse|Creole townhouse]], and [[Louisiana Creole people|French Creole]] [[Plantations in the American South|plantation]] house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/travel/louisiana/architecture.htm |title=French Creole Architecture |accessdate=2008-08-02 |work=Louisiana Division of Historic Preservation |publisher=National Park Service's National Register of Historic Places }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Southeast Asia==
There are some colonial buildings as France's legacy in the area, dating back to the 19th and 20th [[French Indochina]] colony. Most of them are located in [[Hanoi]], [[Ho Chi Minh City]] and [[Phnom Penh]]. Saigon (present-day Ho Chi Minh City) and Hanoi, as the capitals of Indochina, respectively, in 1887–1902 and 1902-1945, present the most exceptional and among the best-preserved French Colonial buildings in the region, including:

'''Gibsons Games''' is an independent, family owned [[United Kingdom|British]] board game and [[jigsaw puzzle]] manufacturer, and the oldest of its kind in the [[United Kingdom]].
In 1903, Harry Gibson managed to obtain an unsecured loan of £500 from the Royal Bank of Scotland in Bishopsgate, London. This generous sum enabled him to start a business, which at that time was called The International Card Co. Trading from offices in Aldersgate Street, he supplied retailers with a range of products including card games and postcards; an unlikely combination these days, but back then, most towns would have a number of stationers in the High Street and they became Harry Percy’s first customers.
The International Card business was sold to the De La Rue Company and H. P. Gibson &amp; Sons Limited was formed in 1919. The International Series brand continued to be used on some products right up to the early 1980s, but H P Gibson &amp; Sons Ltd made its name with the ‘HPG’ brand of indoor games, with old favourites such as L’Attaque and Dover Patrol; huge sellers before and after the Second World War. Sadly the company’s premises, along with all its manufacturing equipment were destroyed during the blitz in 1940 and when the war ended, it was almost a case of starting from scratch.
Robert and Harry Gibson (jnr.), sons of the founder, re-established trading from Barrett Street in London’s West End. The company continued to sell its own family games and pastimes, alongside ranges from other established names, including Waddingtons and Chad Valley.
1966 Harry Percy’s grandson, Michael Gibson joined the family business. He remembers his father paying him £11.00 a week out of which he had to pay his mother living expenses. In the late 70s H P Gibson &amp; Sons shortened its name to ‘Gibsons’, and shortly after, in the early 80s, Gibsons introduced their first jigsaw puzzles. 

Gibsons originally had only six puzzle pictures in the range which depicted aerial shots of well-known British landmarks, but nowadays, the range has grown to over 250 titles, running from 2 to 2000 pieces, with over 50 new jigsaw puzzle images added every year.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5373">'''Joachim Ritter''' ({{IPA-de|ˈʁɪtɐ|lang}}; April 3, 1903 – August 3, 1974) was a German philosopher and founder of the so-called Ritter School ({{lang-de|Ritter-Schule}}).

==Biography==
Born in [[Geesthacht]], Ritter studied philosophy, theology, German literature, and history in [[Heidelberg]], [[Marburg]], [[Freiburg]] and [[Hamburg]]. A disciple of [[Martin Heidegger]] and [[Ernst Cassirer]], he obtained his doctorate with a dissertation on [[Nicolas of Cusa]] in 1925. Ritter was Cassirer's assistant and a lecturer at the [[University of Hamburg]]. A [[Marxism|Marxist]] in the late 1920s and early 1930s, he became a member of the [[Nazi Party]] in 1937 and an officer of the German [[Wehrmacht]] in 1940. After [[World War II]], Ritter was appointed professor of philosophy at the [[University of Münster]].&lt;ref&gt;Mark Schweda, ''Joachim Ritter und die Ritter-Schule zur Einführung'', Hamburg: Junius 2015, p. 14-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ritter's philosophical work focuses on a theory of [[modernity]]. In a liberal interpretation of [[Hegel|Hegel's]] ''[[Elements of the Philosophy of Right|Philosophy of Right]]'', he developed the view that "bifurcation" is the constitutive structure of the modern world and a necessary precondition for the universal realization of individual freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Comay, ''Mourning Sickness: Hegel and the French Revolution'', Stanford: Stanford University Press 2011, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ritter's theory of culture as compensation, arts and humanities have the function of balancing the [[Disenchantment|disenchanted]], ahistorical condition of modern society.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas E. Di Liberto, [http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1102&amp;context=edissertations ''Overcoming the Empty Years: the Role of Philosophy and the Humanities in West Germany after 1945''] (2009). Publicly accessible Penn Dissertations. Paper 89, p. 307-312.&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]], his work on [[Aristotle]]'s ethics and political theory initiated the renewal of practical philosophy in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Kelvin Knight, ''Aristotelian Philosophy: Ethics and Politics from Aristotle to MacIntyre'', Cambridge: Polity 2007, p. 64-101.&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in [[Münster]].

==Legacy==
Ritter is considered one of the most influential philosophers in postwar [[West Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;Jan Werner Müller, ''A Dangerous Mind: Carl Schmitt in Post-War European Thought'', Yale University Press 2003, p. 116-132&lt;/ref&gt; Among his disciples were scholars and public intellectuals like [[Ernst-Wolfgang Böckenförde]], [[Max Imdahl]], [[Hermann Lübbe]], [[Odo Marquard]], and [[Robert Spaemann]]. Together with them, Ritter started the „Historisches Wörterbuch der Philosophie“ and contributed to development of [[conceptual history]] in the field of philosophy. In the 1980s, [[Jürgen Habermas]] opposed the Ritter School for being leading representatives of German [[neo-conservatism]].&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Habermas, ''Neoconservative Culture Criticism in the United States and West Germany: An Intellectual Movement in Two Political Cultures'', in: Télos 1983 (56), p. 75-89. &lt;/ref&gt; More recent scholarship in intellectual history points out Ritter's seminal role for the modernization of German political thought and the development of a modern [[Liberalism|liberal]] [[republicanism]].&lt;ref&gt;Jens Hacke, ''Philosophie der Bürgerlichkeit. Die liberalkonservative Begründung der Bundesrepublik'', Göttingen: Wallstein 2006/2008. See also Jerry Z. Muller, ''German Neo-Conservatism ca. 1968–1985.

'''Jēkabs Bīne''' (11 April 1895-24 October 1955) was a Latvian painter, [[stained glass]] artist, teacher and art critic.

== Biography ==
Jēkabs Bīne was born in [[Riga]] in 1895 in merchant family. He studied at the [[Riga City Art School]] (1913-1915), [[Kharkov Art School]] (1915-1918) and the [[Art Academy of Latvia]] (1921–1926).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artnet.com/artists/jekabs-bine/biography Jekabs Bine Biography]. [[Artnet]].&lt;/ref&gt; His graduation work from [[Jānis Tilbergs]]' figurative painting class at the Art Academy was the painting ''Resurrection''. He held teaching positions throughout his life: at the Art Studio of the Latvian People University (1928-1940), Riga People University, Institute of Housekeeping in Kaucminde (1932-1939), at the Riga State Art of Craft School (1933-1944), at the School of the Riga society of painters (1936-1939), at the Art Academy of Latvia (1942-1944), at the Kuldiga Secondary Art School (1944-1951), and at combine "Art" (1951-1955).&lt;ref name="paintings"&gt;[http://paintings.lv/en/artist/55?view=about Jekabs Bine]. Galerija Jēkabs.&lt;/ref&gt;

His first solo exhibition was held in 1917. In the 1920s he painted Christian subjects, including the altarpieces for the churches in Cesvaines (1924), Jumprava (1926) and Vecsaule (1927). His focus on sacral painting developed into an interest in Latvian mythology, [[idealism]] and an ambition to connect art to folk culture and nature.&lt;ref name="paintings" /&gt; He studied the symbols of Latvian ornamentation and incorporated this in his art. He became involved in [[Ernests Brastiņš]]' [[Modern Paganism|neopagan]] movement [[Dievturība]] and became one of its main public promotors.&lt;ref name="opentheology"&gt;Anita Stasulane, Gatis Ozoliņš. [https://www.degruyter.com/downloadpdf/j/opth.2017.3.issue-1/opth-2017-0019/opth-2017-0019.pdf Transformations of Neopaganism in Latvia: From Survival to Revival]. ''[[Open Theology]]'' 2017; 3: 239–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1940 and throughout the [[Stalinist]] era this was repressed as "bourgeois art". Bīne's diaries show that he was disappointed with the direction of Soviet authorities set out for art and viewed it as vulgarization. He did however adapt to the new regime. As part of his acceptance of a position as a [[stained glass]] specialist in 1951, he wrote a 1952 paper titled ''Ornament'' in which he condemned his previous views on Latvian ornamentation.&lt;ref name="opentheology" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="911">The '''Karlskoga Nobel Art Scholarship''' is an annual [[scholarship]] given to artists in memory of the Swedish inventor [[Alfred Nobel]].  In 1996 a [[Sweden|Swedish]] artist by the name of Göran Persson created a portfolio of graphics describing Nobel's life in [[Karlskoga]], Sweden. Proceeds from the sales of the portfolio were used as the initial fund for the scholarship.

A project of the [[Karlskoga Municipality]], the scholarship is open to all active Swedish artists with preference given to those working in [[graphics]]. Founded in 1996, the first Karlskoga Nobel Art Scholarship award was given on December 10 of the same year. Recipients of the scholarship have their works selected by a jury.

'''''Kinderstern'''''/'''''Star for Children''''', is an artwork the German artist [[Imi Knoebel]] has created since 1988. The artwork is entirely donated to projects for children in need. The Star for Children has so far collected donations of four million Euros and is the only artwork worldwide which proceeds go a 100% to children in need. The "Star for Children in Need" receives support through artists and collectors, musicians and actors/actresses,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.welt.de/print-wams/article617615/Der_Stern_fuer_Kinder_in_Not.html ''Der Stern für Kinder in Not'', viewed 11.21.2011]&lt;/ref&gt; museums like [[Deutsche Guggenheim]] in Berlin and Sammlung Grässlin in the Blackforest&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deutsche-guggenheim.de/assets-alt/pdf/DGM7.pdf ''Stars for Children in Need'' accessdate=November 21, 2011] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120611140110/http://www.deutsche-guggenheim.de/assets-alt/pdf/DGM7.pdf |date=June 11, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Kunst tut gut'' Museum Fridericianum Kassel 1995&lt;/ref&gt; and art fairs.&lt;ref&gt;''Ein Kinderstern für Tschernobyl-Opfer'' Art Frankfurt 1993, Frankfurter Rundschau 25.

==Leitmotif==
Kinderstern stands for the [[Children's rights]] .

==Idea==
[[File:Kinderstern 1991.jpg|thumb|Drawing by Johannes Stuettgen. Art transforms itself to stand for the Children's rights]]
The Kinderstern  is a [[Social sculpture]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uni-jena.de/060519_Knoebel.html ''Bildbegriff der Moderne zu erweitern und mit der Idee der Sozialen Plastik seines Lehrers zu versöhnen sucht'', accessdate=November 22, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;  realizing the extended notion of art, formulated 1967 by  [[Joseph Beuys]], by which art also ought to change society. Donations given to Kinderstern transform the donated money to being a Bearer of the Right of a Child, exposing a deeper purpose of money: Bearer of Human Rights. Kinderstern stands for the Rights and dignity of all Children. It stands for the right of a home, of food, of generous attention, medical care, and education. This patronage unifies unredeemed Rights of Children,  Kinderstern is their artwork in times of need.

==History==
[[File:P1010136 rgb 72dpi.jpg|thumb|Kinderstern on tour 2011]]

In 1988, the Star for Children was printed for the first time as silkscreen in red. This print was, next to original prints from the artists [[Sol LeWitt]], [[Jörg Immendorff]],  [[Sigmar Polke]], [[Max Bill]], [[Heinz Mack]], [[Keith Haring]], part of a portfolio created under the auspices of [[Lothar Späth]],&lt;ref&gt;''Kinderstern'' Zeitschrift für Allgemeinmedizin, 15. Januar 1990&lt;/ref&gt; minister-president of Baden-Württemberg/Germany. Title of the portfolio: „Kinderstern“/Star for Children . Its proceeds supported the financing of accommodations for parents close to pediatric clinics.
Imi Knoebels artistic intention that lead and tied him to the Star for Children went beyond the first project. His intention aimed at continuity and expansion. Star for Children became the aggenda with the promise to actively step into the breach in the name of children. In the same year with headquarters in Düsseldorf a non-profit organization was founded under the name Kinderstern/Star for Children . Their responsibilities included detecting projects of non-profit organizations already carried out serving children in need. Imi Knoebel, as the artistic initiator not a member, committed himself to continuously producing stars for the non profit organization. Almost every year new Stars for Children are released in limited colors. These Stars for Children are donated as an appreciation to all contributors who support the agenda of the Star for Children.

'''''La Revue blanche''''' was a French art and [[literary magazine]] run between 1889 and 1903. Some of the greatest writers and artists of the time were its collaborators.

==History==
The ''Revue blanche'' was founded in [[Liège]] in 1889 and run by the Natanson brothers (Alexander, Thaddeus and Louis-Alfred, aka "Alfred Athis"). In 1891, the magazine moved to [[Paris]] where it rivaled the ''[[Mercure de France]]'', hence its name, which served mark the difference with the ''Mercure'''s  purple cover. During the early years the magazine was associated with [[Marcel Proust]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Ellison|title=A Reader's Guide to Proust's 'In Search of Lost Time'|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RBv3wE6l-RYC&amp;pg=PA12|accessdate=21 November 2014|date=18 February 2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-78909-7|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thaddeus's wife, Misia, participated in the launch of the magazine and served as a model for some covers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Toulouse-Lautrec, Henri de|url=http://www.masterworksfineart.com/inventory/4707|publisher=Masterworks Fine Art|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The critics [[Lucien Muhlfeld]] and [[Félix Fénéon]] from 1896 to 1903 served as secretaries, as well as [[Léon Blum]] himself.

The journal served as a representative for the cultural and artistic intelligentsia of the time. Starting from 1898, at the instigation of [[Lucien Herr]], it contributed to the [[Dreyfus affair]],&lt;ref name=ven&gt;{{cite book|author=Venita Datta|title=Birth of a National Icon: The Literary Avant-Garde and the Origins of the Intellectual in France|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AdSfgOC9n8AC&amp;pg=PA22|accessdate=21 November 2014|year=1999|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-4207-4|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; siding with the captain accused of treason. During this period the magazine developed close relations with [[Emile Durkheim]].&lt;ref name=ven/&gt;

[[Octave Mirbeau]] published his ''[[The Diary of a Chambermaid (novel)|Diary of a Chambermaid]]'' in serial form in the ''Revue blanche'' in 1900.

'''LeBaron Incorporated''' (originally '''LeBaron, Carrossiers Inc.''') was a design and [[coachbuilder|coach building company]] from 1920 until 1953. American designers [[Dietrich Inc.|Raymond H. Dietrich]] and [[Hibbard &amp; Darrin|Thomas L. Hibbard]] had met while working for [[Brewster &amp; Co.|Brewster]]. '''LeBaron''' was founded in [[New York City]] in 1920 by [[Dietrich Inc.|Raymond H. Dietrich]] and [[Hibbard &amp; Darrin|Thomas L. Hibbard]].&lt;ref name="coachbuilt.com"/&gt; The company originally was called '''LeBaron, Carrossiers Inc.''', and served as design consultants. Dietrich and Hibbard were unknown outside of Brewster, so a clever new name - LeBaron, Carrossiers - was arrived at by the two partners using a list of French words that had the ring of prestige and could be easily pronounced through a telephone.&lt;ref name="coachbuilt.com"/&gt;  

==Founding==
Business progressed in 1920 that Thomas Hibbard offered his friend, Ralph Roberts, who had just gotten his Bachelor of Science degree from [[Dartmouth College]], a job. Tom Hibbard met fellow designer, [[Howard Darrin|Howard A. "Dutch" Darrin]] in 1923. Hibbard and Darrin decided to go to Paris, initially to try to sell LeBaron designs but instead decided to set up their own company and founded [[Hibbard &amp; Darrin]]. Hibbard resigned from LeBaron in 1923. Dietrich and Roberts continued operating LeBaron with a new illustrator, veteran Roland L. Stickney.&lt;ref name="coachbuilt.com"/&gt;Tiring of the corporate environment they started freelance work in their spare time and when William H. Brewster discovered this he fired Dietrich and Hibbard left.&lt;ref name="hemmings"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.hemmings.com/hcc/stories/2006/07/01/hmn_feature16.html | title=Howard A.

In 1924, LeBaron merged with the Blue Ribbon and Bridgeport Body companies and changed their name to '''LeBaron Inc.''', becoming body builders as well as designers.&lt;ref name="webring.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webspace.webring.com/people/nm/michael_a_cole/hist.html|title=Chrysler LeBaron History|work=webring.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5umfCdb1v?url=http://webspace.webring.com/people/nm/michael_a_cole/hist.html|archivedate=2010-12-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conceptcarz.com/vehicle/z17187/Chrysler-LeBaron.aspx|title=1985 Chrysler LeBaron  (LeBaron Town &amp; Country, LeBaron Mark Cross Convertible, T&amp;C, LeBaron GTS, LS Sedan) - Conceptcarz.com|work=conceptcarz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="coachbuilt.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="coachbuilt.com1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coachbuilt.com/bui/b/briggs/briggs.htm|title=Briggs Mfg.

LeBaron became one of the many prominent [[coachbuilder]]s in the 1920s to provide bodies for luxury cars. Until the late 1930s, most of the great prestige automakers - [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]], [[Hispano-Suiza]], [[Duesenberg]], [[Packard]] - often supplied only a running chassis, which wealthy buyers would outfit with custom bodywork at substantial extra cost.

==Briggs Manufacturing==
Dietrich received a lucrative offer from [[Murray Corporation of America|Murray Corporation]], one of [[Ford Motor Company|Ford's]] and [[Lincoln (automobile)|Lincoln's]] main body builders, in 1925 and resigned from LeBaron to start [[Dietrich Inc.|Dietrich, Inc.]].  With both founders gone, LeBaron could have been in trouble.  But Roberts continued to run the company and orders kept coming in.
[[Walter Briggs, Sr.|Walter O. Briggs]] began talks with Roberts in 1926 to buy LeBaron and move it to Detroit, setting up operations at [[Mack Avenue Engine Complex|Mack Avenue Stamping (Old Mack Factory)]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allpar.com/corporate/factories/mack-avenue-engine.html History of Mack Avenue factories]&lt;/ref&gt;

LeBaron was purchased by [[Briggs Manufacturing Company]] of Detroit in 1926 and operated as a subsidiary.  Briggs was already supplying bodies to nearby [[Chrysler]], [[Essex (automobile)|Essex]], [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], [[Hudson Motor Car Company|Hudson]], and [[Overland Automobile|Overland]].  As a Briggs subsidiary, LeBaron handled special custom work, provided design ideas for the main business, and supplied exquisite custom bodies for various car companies such as [[Chrysler]]'s luxury [[Chrysler Imperial|Imperial]] line, [[Duesenberg]], [[Packard]], and [[Cadillac]].  In 1932, for example, they built 28 beautiful Imperial Custom Convertible Coupes, Chrysler's top model, which rode a 146-inch wheelbase and used a 384.8 cubic-inch straight-8 engine.&lt;ref name="webring.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="coachbuilt.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="coachbuilt.com1"/&gt;

Thomas L. Hibbard became design director at [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] in 1947. Raymond H. Dietrich was hired by Chrysler in 1932 to become the first official Chrysler stylist.&lt;ref name="coachbuilt.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="coachbuilt.com1"/&gt;

The lion lights were devised by [[Maasai people|Maasai]] Richard Turere to prevent night attacks by lions on his family's [[cattle]] herd, which was in [[Kitengela]] on the unfenced south side of [[Nairobi National Park]], in [[Kenya]]. These types of attacks often lead to the hunting and killing of the lions, which are endangered.

When Richard Turere was 9 he tried kerosene lamps and [[scarecrow]]s but these proved not to work, but he noticed that the lions did not attack when people were present, and he theorised that they were deterred by moving torchlight. Therefore, Turere &lt;ref name="paula"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnXbRO3CcTQ Lion Li/]&lt;/ref&gt; placed LED lights around the perimeter of his family's cow shed, connected them to vehicle indicator flashers, and powered the system from car batteries charged by a solar panel.

The lion attacks ceased and soon neighbours were asking for him to set up similar systems around their farms.&lt;ref name="paula"/&gt; The cattle were also calmer because the lights meant that they could see the land around was safe.

Based on this invention, Turere won a scholarship to [[Brookhouse School]].&lt;ref name="paula"/&gt;

Although originally intended for lions, lion lights may also work for other predators such as [[leopard]]s and [[cheetah]]s.

The '''''Madonna of Foligno''''' is a painting by the [[Italy|Italian]] [[High Renaissance]] painter [[Raphael]].  First painted on [[Panel painting|wood panel]], it was later [[Transfer of panel paintings|transferred to canvas]].

==History==
The painting was executed for Sigismondo de' Conti, chamberlain to [[Pope Julius II]], in 1511. It was placed on a high altar of the church of [[Santa Maria in Aracoeli]] on [[Capitoline Hill]] ([[Italian language|Italian]]: Campidoglio) in [[Rome]],&lt;ref name="Champlin"&gt;{{cite book | title=Cyclopedia of Painters and Paintings | editor=Champlin, J |editor2=Perkins, C | volume=3 | publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons | location=New York | year=1913 | page=138 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4wgFAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA138}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bates"/&gt; where Sigismondo was buried in 1512.

It was moved by Anna Conti, a descendant of Sigismondi Conti, to the monastery of St. Anne in [[Foligno]] in 1565 and remained there for more than two centuries, hence the name.&lt;ref name="Champlin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bates"/&gt;

In 1799 it was carried to Paris, France by Napoleon. There, in 1802, the painting was transferred from panel to canvas by Hacquin and restored by Roser of Heidelberg.&lt;ref name="Champlin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bates"/&gt; A note was made by the restorer: "Rapporto dei cittadini Guijon Vincent Tannay e Berthollet sul ristauro dei quadri di Raffaello conosciuto sotto il nome di Madonna di Foligno." &lt;ref name="Ricci"/&gt;

In 1815, after the [[Battle of Waterloo]], it was returned to Italy, where it was placed in the room with the [[Transfiguration (Raphael)|Transfiguration]]&lt;ref name="Champlin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bates"/&gt; in the Pinacoteca Vaticana of the [[Vatican Museum]] in the [[Vatican City]].

==Description==
The painting is a ''[[Sacred conversation|sacra conversazione]],'' where holy figures seem to be in conversation and draw the audience into their discussion.&lt;ref name="Hersey"&gt;{{cite book | title=High Renaissance art in St. Peter's and the Vatican: An Interpretive Guide | author=Hersey, G | publisher=University of Chicago Press | location=Chicago | year=1993 | page=124 | isbn=0-226-32781-7 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fs5zhwjSYAUC&amp;pg=PA124 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than sitting under a canopy, of the Umbrian or Florentine style,&lt;ref name="Bates"/&gt; the Virgin is seated on clouds, embracing Jesus, while surrounded by angels. They look down upon Sigismonde de' Conti, kneeling in a red, fur lined cape.  Conti is presented by [[St. Jerome]] on the right with his lion, appealing for the Virgin's protection.  On the left are the kneeling [[St. Francis of Assisi]] and [[St. John the Baptist]], who is standing and wearing a tunic of skins. As St. John points to Jesus, he clearly looks out to us, pulling us in, while St. Francis points to us and looks at the Christ Child.  Between the men is an angel, linking the saints of earth to the seraph host of heaven. Behind them are the towers of Foligno.&lt;ref name="Champlin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bates"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ricci"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hersey"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Potter"/&gt;

Painted during Raphael's Roman period, it is a testament to his artistic maturity, evidenced in the paintings composition, coloring and form.&lt;ref name="Ricci"&gt;{{cite book | title=Vatican: Its History Its Treasures | author=Ricci, C | publisher=Kessinger Publishing | location= | year=2003 | origyear=1914 | page=216 | isbn=0-7661-3941-7 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mu86ZWFl9GYC&amp;pg=PA216 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Conti commissioned the painting to commemorate his survival of a shell that exploded near him during the Siege of Foligno, his hometown.  He credited his safety to heavenly intervention.&lt;ref name="Bates"&gt;{{cite book | title=Masters in Art: A Series of Illustrated Monographs | volume=1 | author= | publisher=Bates &amp; Guild Company | location=Boston | year=1900 | page=38 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Oq4pAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA38 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ricci"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hersey"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Potter"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Vatican: Being a Brief History of the Palace, and an account of the Principal Art Treasures within its Walls | author=Potter, M | publisher=The Botolph Society | location=Boston | year=1912 | page=308 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s7uS2GseeJsC&amp;pg=PA308 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian [[Massimo Polidoro]] this painting has been used by UFO websites as evidence of a flying saucer crash. What Polidoro says you are actually seeing is the house of Sigismondo Conti and a fireball. Painters at this time used "symbolic meanings that were anything but random." The angel is holding a sign with nothing written on it. According to Polidoro this was because Sigismondo died before he could tell Raphael what "thank you" to the Virgin he wanted written on the sign. Polidoro calls the UFO explanation, "reinterpreting with the eyes of twenty-first-century Europeans the product of other cultures".&lt;ref name="Polidoro"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Polidoro|first1=Massimo|authorlink=Massimo Polidoro|title=Does the Vatican Hold a Painting of a UFO?|journal=Skeptical Inquirer|date=2018|volume=42|issue=3|page=19|publisher=Committee for Skeptical Inquiry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mogao Caves''', also known as the '''Thousand Buddha Grottoes''' or '''Caves of the Thousand Buddhas''', form a system of 492 temples {{convert|25|km|mi|abbr=on}} southeast of the center of [[Dunhuang]], an oasis strategically located at a religious and cultural crossroads on the [[Silk Road]], in [[Gansu]] province, China. The caves may also be known as the '''Dunhuang Caves''', however, this term is also used as a collective term to include other Buddhist cave sites in and around the Dunhuang area, such as the [[Western Thousand Buddha Caves]], [[Eastern Thousand Buddha Caves]], [[Yulin Caves]], and [[Five Temple Caves]]. The caves contain some of the finest examples of [[Buddhist art]] spanning a period of 1,000 years.&lt;ref name="unesco"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/440
|title=Mogao Caves
|publisher=UNESCO
|accessdate=2007-08-05
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The first caves were dug out in 366 AD as places of Buddhist meditation and worship.&lt;ref name="unesco"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zhang Wengin&lt;/ref&gt; The Mogao Caves are the best known of the [[China|Chinese]] Buddhist grottoes and, along with [[Longmen Grottoes]] and [[Yungang Grottoes]], are one of the three famous ancient Buddhist sculptural sites of China.

An important cache of documents was discovered in 1900 in the so-called "Library Cave", which had been walled-up in the 11th century. The contents of the library were subsequently dispersed around the world, and the largest collections are now found in Beijing, London, Paris and Berlin, and the [[International Dunhuang Project]] exists to coordinate and collect scholarly work on the [[Dunhuang manuscripts]] and other material. The caves themselves are now a popular tourist destination, with a number open for visiting.&lt;ref name=LAT&gt;Makinen, Julie (September 27, 2014) [http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/la-et-cm-mogao-grottoes-buddhist-caves-dunhuang-20140928-story.html "Getty Institute helps save China's Mogao Grottoes from tourism's impact"] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The caves are commonly referred to in Chinese as the Thousand Buddha Caves ({{zh|c=千佛洞|p=qiānfó dòng}}), a name that some scholars have speculated to have come from the legend of its founding, when a monk Yuezun had a vision of a thousand Buddhas at the site.  This name however may have come from the large number of Buddha figures at the site, or the miniatures figures painted on the walls of these caves as these figures are called "thousand Buddhas" colloquially.{{sfn|Chung|1994|pp=29&amp;ndash;30}} The name Mogao Caves ({{zh|c={{linktext|莫高窟}}|p= Mògāo kū}}) was used in the Tang dynasty, where 'Mogao' refers to an administrative district at the site during the Tang dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=voerPYsAB5wC&amp;pg=PA242#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Asia and Oceania: International Dictionary of Historic Places|editors= Trudy Ring, Noelle Watson, Paul Schellinger|page=242 |publisher=Routledge|date=13 June 1996|isbn= 978-1884964046 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mogao may mean  "peerless" (literally "none higher", where "''mo''" means "none", and "''gao''" means "high");&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/may/13/dunhuang-caves-artifacts-ancient-history-chinese-civilization-getty-institute-silk-road-los-angeles |title=Artifacts from ancient Chinese cave temples head west for California exhibit |first=Jordan |last=Riefe|date=13 May 2016 |work=The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EWmmCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA55&amp;lpg=PA55#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Cave Temples of Mogao at Dunhuang: Art History on the Silk Road: Second Edition |authors= Roderick Whitfield, Susan Whitfield, Neville Agnew |page=55 |publisher=Getty Publications|edition= 2nd |date=29 September 2015|isbn= 978-1606064450}}&lt;/ref&gt; an alternative reading may be "high in the desert" if "mo" is read as a variant of the Chinese term for "desert".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=6wmQAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=mogao+desert+high&amp;q=mo+desert+high |title=Frescoes and Fables: Mural Stories from the Mogao Grottoes in Dunhuang|first=Naomi |last=McPherson |publisher=New World Press|date= 1998|page=14 |isbn=9787800054006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mogao is also used as the name of a modern town that is administered by [[Dunhuang]] city: Mogao Town ({{linktext|莫高|镇}}).&lt;ref name="xzqhdh"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.xzqh.org/html/show/gs/30392.html |script-title=zh:敦煌市历史沿革 |trans-title=Dunhuang City Historical Development |publisher=XZQH.org |language=Simplified Chinese |date=27 June 2016 |accessdate=27 May 2018 |quote="{{lang|zh-hans|莫高镇}}"}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="statsdh"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stats.gov.cn/tjsj/tjbz/tjyqhdmhcxhfdm/2016/62/09/620982.html |title=2016年统计用区划代码和城乡划分代码：敦煌市 |trans-title=2016 Statistical Area Numbers and Rural-Urban Area Numbers: Duhuang City |language=zh-hans |publisher=[[National Bureau of Statistics of the People's Republic of China]] |date=2016 |accessdate=27 May 2018 |quote="{{lang|zh-hans|莫高镇}}"}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mogao Caves are also often referred to as the Dunhuang Caves after the nearest city [[Dunhuang]], which means "blazing beacon" as beacons were used  at the frontier outpost to warn of attacks by nomadic tribes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HDBZDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA87 |title=Cave Temples of Dunhuang |isbn=9781606064894 |author1=Agnew |first1=Neville |last2=Reed |first2=Marcia |last3=Ball |first3=Tevvy |date=2016-05-07 |page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term Dunhuang Caves however is also used in a broader sense as a collective term for all the caves found in or around the Dunhuang area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=HvIa9sere_8C&amp;pg=PA427#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Eighteen Lectures on Dunhuang |first= Xinjiang |last=Rong |page=427 |publisher=Brill Academic Publishers|isbn=9789004252332 |date=2013-06-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Dunhuang Mogao cave 159.jpg|thumb|left|Details of painting of the meeting of [[Manjusri]] and [[Vimalakirti]]. Cave 159.]]
Dunhuang was established as a frontier garrison outpost by the Han Dynasty [[Emperor Wu of Han|Emperor Wudi]] to protect against the [[Xiongnu]] in 111 BC. It also became an important gateway to the West, a centre of commerce along the [[Silk Road]], as well as a meeting place of various people and religions such as [[Buddhism]].

The construction of the Mogao Caves near Dunhuang is generally taken to have begun sometime in the fourth century AD. According to a book written during the reign of Tang [[Wu Zetian|Empress Wu]], ''Fokan Ji'' ({{lang|zh-hant|佛龕記}}, ''An Account of Buddhist Shrines'') by Li Junxiu ({{lang|zh|李君修}}), a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] monk named Lè Zūn ({{lang|zh-hant|樂尊}}, which may also be pronounced Yuezun) had a vision of a thousand [[Gautama Buddha|Buddhas]] bathed in golden light at the site in 366 AD, inspiring him to build a cave here.&lt;ref&gt;''Fokan Ji'' {{lang|zh-hant|《佛龕記》}} '''Original text:''' {{lang|zh-hans|莫高窟者厥，秦建元二年，有沙门乐僔，戒行清忠，执心恬静。当杖锡林野，行至此山，忽见金光，状有千佛。□□□□□，造窟一龛。}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The story is also found in other sources, such as in inscriptions on a [[stele]] in cave 332; an earlier date of 353 however was given in another document, ''Shazhou Tujing'' ({{lang|zh-hant|沙州土鏡}}, ''Geography of Shazhou'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Le Huu Phuoc |title=Buddhist Architecture |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9jb364g4BvoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |publisher=Grafikol |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-9844043-0-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was later joined by a second monk Faliang ({{lang|zh|法良}}), and the site gradually grew, by the time of the [[Northern Liang]] a small community of monks had formed at the site. The caves initially served only as a place of meditation for hermit monks, but developed to serve the monasteries that sprang up nearby. Members of the ruling family of [[Northern Wei]] and [[Northern Zhou]] constructed many caves here, and it flourished in the short-lived [[Sui Dynasty]]. By the [[Tang Dynasty]], the number of caves had reached over a thousand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the Sui and Tang dynasties, Mogao Caves had become a place of worship and pilgrimage for the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Dunhuang Sees Great Changes Over the Years |author=Xiuqing Yang |publisher=China Intercontinental Press |year=2007 |isbn=7-5085-0916-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From the 4th until the 14th century, caves were constructed by monks to serve as shrines with funds from donors. These caves were elaborately painted, the cave paintings and architecture serving as aids to [[meditation]], as visual representations of the quest for enlightenment, as [[mnemonic]] devices, and as teaching tools to inform those illiterate about Buddhist beliefs and stories. The major caves were sponsored by patrons such as important clergy, local ruling elite, foreign dignitaries, as well as Chinese emperors. Other caves may have been funded by merchants, military officers, and other local people such as women's groups.

During the Tang Dynasty, Dunhuang became the main hub of commerce of the Silk Road and a major religious centre. A large number of the caves were constructed at Mogao during this era, including the two large statues of Buddha at the site, the largest one constructed in 695 following an edict a year earlier by Tang Empress [[Wu Zetian]] to build giant statues across the country.&lt;ref name="duanwenjie"&gt;{{cite book  |first= Chung |last=Tan |title=Dunhuang art: through the eyes of Duan Wenjie |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0SdXEVaFTJ0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=daqin&amp;f=false  |isbn=81-7017-313-2 |year=1994 |publisher= Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts }}&lt;/ref&gt; The site escaped the [[Great Anti-Buddhist Persecution|persecution of Buddhists]] ordered by [[Emperor Wuzong of Tang|Emperor Wuzong]] in 845 as it was then under [[Tibetan Empire|Tibetan]] control. As a frontier town, Dunhuang had been occupied at various times by other non-Han Chinese people. After the Tang Dynasty, the site went into a gradual decline, and construction of new caves ceased entirely after the [[Yuan Dynasty]]. By then Islam had conquered much of Central Asia, and the Silk Road declined in importance when trading via sea-routes began to dominate Chinese trade with the outside world. During the Ming Dynasty, the Silk Road was finally officially abandoned, and Dunhuang slowly became depopulated and largely forgotten by the outside world. Most of the Mogao caves were abandoned; the site, however, was still a place of pilgrimage and was used as a place of worship by local people at the beginning of the twentieth century when there was renewed interest in the site.

=== Discovery and revival ===
[[File:Anonymous-Bodhisattva Leading the Way.jpg|thumb|right|Bodhisattva leading a lady [[donor portrait|donor]] towards the Pure Lands. Painting on silk (Library Cave), Late Tang.]]
During late nineteenth century and early twentieth century, Western explorers began to show interest in the ancient Silk Road and the lost cities of Central Asia, and those who passed through Dunhuang noted the murals, sculptures, and artifacts such as the [[Stele of Sulaiman]] at Mogao. The biggest discovery, however, came from a Chinese [[Taoist]] named [[Wang Yuanlu]] who appointed himself guardian of some of these temples around the turn of the century.

Some of the caves had by then been blocked by sand, and Wang set about clearing away the sand and made an attempt at repairing the site. In one such cave, on 25 June 1900, Wang discovered a walled up area behind one side of a corridor leading to a main cave.&lt;ref name="Duan"&gt;{{cite book|author=Wenjie Duan|title=Dunhuang Art: Through the Eyes of Duan Wenjie|date=1 January 1994|publisher=Abhinav Publications|isbn=978-81-7017-313-7|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="idp"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Behind the wall was a small cave stuffed with an enormous [[Dunhuang manuscripts|hoard of manuscripts]]. In the next few years, Wang took some manuscripts to show to various officials who expressed varying level of interest, but in 1904 Wang re-sealed the cave following an order by the governor of Gansu.

[[File:Wang Yuanlu.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Abbot [[Wang Yuanlu]], discoverer of the hidden Library Cave]]
Words of Wang's discovery drew the attention of a joint British/Indian group led by the Hungarian-born British archaeologist [[Aurel Stein]] who was on an archaeological expedition in the area in 1907.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dsr.nii.ac.jp/toyobunko/VIII-5-B2-9/V-2/page/0283.html.en Aurel Stein, Serindia vol. II] pg. 801-802&lt;/ref&gt;  Stein negotiated with Wang to allow him to remove a significant number of manuscripts as well as the finest paintings and textiles for a fee. He was followed by a French expedition under [[Paul Pelliot]] who acquired many thousands of items in 1908, and then by a Japanese expedition under [[Otani Kozui]] in 1911 and a Russian expedition under [[Sergei F. Oldenburg]] in 1914. A well-known scholar [[Luo Zhenyu]] edited some of the manuscripts Pelliot acquired into a volume which was then published in 1909 as "Manuscripts of the Dunhuang Caves" ({{lang|zh-hant|敦煌石室遺書}}).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/dunhuang-shi-shi-yi-shu/oclc/52768538 Dunhuang shi shi yi shu]&lt;/ref&gt;

Stein and Pelliot provoked much interest in the West about the Dunhuang Caves; however, there was initially little interest in official circles in China. Concerned that the remaining manuscripts might be lost, Luo Zhenyu and others persuaded the Ministry of Education to recover the rest of the manuscripts to be sent to Peking ([[Beijing]]) in 1910. However, not all the remaining manuscripts were taken to Peking, and of those retrieved, some were then stolen. Some of the caves were [[Russians in China#Vandalism of Mogao Caves|damaged and vandalized by White Russian soldiers]] when they were used by the local authority in 1921 to house Russian soldiers fleeing the [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] following the [[Russian Revolution]].&lt;ref name="杨秀清2006"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yang |first1=Xiuqing (杨秀清) |script-title=zh:风雨敦煌话沧桑: 历经劫难的莫高窟 Feng yu Dunhuang hua cang sang: li jing jie nan de Mogao ku|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xtshc7KLLJwC&amp;pg=PT163|year=2006| publisher = [[:zh:五洲传播出版社|China Intercontinental Press]]|isbn=978-7-5085-0916-7|pages=158–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1924, American explorer [[Langdon Warner]] removed a number of murals as well as a statue from some of the caves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Foreign Devils on the Silk Road |author=Peter Hopkirk |authorlink = Peter Hopkirk|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DoxsQDBQHYEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |publisher=John Murray |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-7195-6448-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = https://www.harvardartmuseums.org/art/209770 |title = From the Harvard Art Museums’ collections Eight Men Ferrying a Statue of the Buddha (from Mogao Cave 323, Dunhuang, Gansu province) }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://img.mp.itc.cn/upload/20160413/2e3f23e8bbaf4d3598091e5b13e369c0.jpg |title = Eight Men Ferrying a Statue of the Buddha }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939 [[Kuomingtang]] soldiers stationed at Dunhuang caused some damage to the murals and statues at the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authors=Whitfield, Roderick, [[Susan Whitfield]], and Neville Agnew|title= Cave Temples of Dunhuang: Art and History on the Silk Road |year=2000|publisher= The British Library |page=37|isbn= 0-7123-4697-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The situation improved in 1941 when, following a visit by [[Wu Zuoren]] to the site the previous year, the painter [[Zhang Daqian]] arrived at the caves with a small team of assistants and stayed for two and a half years to repair and copy the murals. He exhibited and published the copies of the murals in 1943, which helped to publicize and give much prominence to the art of Dunhuang within China.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icm.gov.mo/exhibition/daqian/significanceE.asp The Epochal Significance in Zhang Daqian's Copies of Dunhuang Fresco] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728114420/http://www.icm.gov.mo/exhibition/daqian/significanceE.asp |date=2011-07-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Xiang Da then persuaded [[Yu Youren]], a prominent member of the [[Kuomintang]] (Chinese Nationalist Party), to set up an institution, the Research Institute of Dunhuang Art (which later became the [[Dunhuang Research Academy|Dunhuang Academy]]), at Mogao in 1944 to look after the site and its contents. In 1956, the first [[Premier of the People's Republic of China]], [[Zhou Enlai]], took a personal interest in the caves and sanctioned a grant to repair and protect the site; and in 1961, the Mogao Caves were declared to be a specially protected historical monument by the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]], and large-scale renovation work at Mogao began soon afterwards. The site escaped the widespread damage caused to many religious sites during the [[Cultural Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |first= Chung |last=Tan |title=Dunhuang art: through the eyes of Duan Wenjie |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0SdXEVaFTJ0C&amp;pg=233#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |page=223 |isbn=81-7017-313-2 |year=1994 |publisher= Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Library Cave ==

[[File:Dunhuang Cave 16.jpg|thumb|280px|Picture of Cave 16, by Aurel Stein in 1907, with manuscripts piled up beside the entrance to Cave 17, the Library Cave, which is to the right in this picture.]]
The cave no. 17 discovered by [[Wang Yuanlu]] came to be known as the Library Cave. It is sited off the entrance leading to cave no.16, and was originally used as a memorial cave for a local monk Hongbian on his death in 862. Hongbian, from a wealthy Wu family, was responsible for the construction of cave 16, and the Library Cave may have been used as his retreat in his lifetime. The cave originally contained his statue which was moved to another cave when it was used to keep manuscripts, some of which bear Hongbian's seal. A large number of documents dating from 406 to 1002 were found in the cave, heaped up in closely packed layers of bundles of scrolls. In addition to the 1,100 bundles of scrolls, there were also over 15,000 paper books and shorter texts, including a Hebrew penitential prayer (selichah) (see [[Dunhuang manuscripts]]). The Library Cave also contained textiles such as banners, numerous damaged figurines of Buddhas, and other Buddhist paraphernalia. According to Stein who was the first to describe the cave in its original state:&lt;ref&gt;[http://dsr.nii.ac.jp/toyobunko/VIII-5-B2-8/V-2/page/0246.html.en Opening of the hidden chapel] M. Aurel Stein, ''Ruins of Desert Cathay: Vol II''&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Heaped up in layers, but without any order, there appeared in the dim light of the priest's little lamp a solid mass of manuscript bundles rising to a height of nearly ten feet, and filling, as subsequent measurement showed, close on 500 cubic feet. The area left clear within the room was just sufficient for two people to stand in.|Aurel Stein|''Ruins of Desert Cathay: Vol. II''}}
The Library Cave was walled off sometime early in the 11th century. A number of theories have been proposed as the reason for sealing the caves. Stein first proposed that the cave had become a waste repository for venerable, damaged and used manuscripts and hallowed paraphernalia and then sealed perhaps when the place came under threat. Following this interpretation some suggested that the handwritten manuscripts of the [[Tripitaka]] became obsolete when printing became widespread, the older manuscripts were therefore stored away.&lt;ref&gt;Akira, Fujieda, "The Tun-Huan Manuscripts", in ''Essays on the sources for Chinese history'' (1973). edited by Donald D. Leslie, Colin Mackerras, and Wang Gungwu. [[Australian National University]], {{ISBN|0-87249-329-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another suggestion is that the cave was simply used as a book storehouse for documents which accumulated over a century and a half, then sealed up when it became full.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toyo-bunko.or.jp/newresearch/upload/2010011510422259.pdf The Provenance and Character of the Dunhuang Documents] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414223151/http://www.toyo-bunko.or.jp/newresearch/upload/2010011510422259.pdf |date=2012-04-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Others, such as Pelliot, suggested an alternative scenario, that the monks hurriedly hid the documents in advance of an attack by invaders, perhaps when [[Western Xia|Xi Xia]] invaded in 1035. This theory was proposed in light of the absence of documents from Xi Xia and the disordered state in which Pelliot found the room (perhaps a misinterpretation because unbeknownst to him the room was disturbed by Stein months before). Another theory posits that the items were from a monastic library and hidden due to threats from Muslims who were moving eastward. This theory proposes that the monks of a nearby monastery heard about the fall of the Buddhist [[kingdom of Khotan]] to [[Kara-Khanid Khanate|Karakhanids]] invaders from [[Kashgar]] in 1006 and the destruction it caused, so they sealed their library to avoid it being destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Rong, [http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/asie_0766-1177_1999_num_11_1_1155 The Nature of the Dunhuang Library Cave and the Reasons for its Sealing]&lt;/ref&gt;  The latest date recorded in the documents found in the cave is generally accepted to be 1002, and although other dates have been suggested, the cave was likely to have been sealed not long after that date.

===Dunhuang manuscripts===
{{Main|Dunhuang manuscripts}}
[[File:Pelliot cave163.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Paul Pelliot]] examining manuscripts in the Library Cave, 1908]]

The manuscripts from the Library Cave date from fifth century until early eleventh century when it was sealed. Up to 50,000 manuscripts may have been kept there, one of the greatest treasure troves of ancient documents found. While most of them are in Chinese, a large number of documents are in various other languages such as [[Tibetic languages|Tibetan]], [[Old Uyghur alphabet|Uigur]], [[Sanskrit]], and [[Sogdian language|Sogdian]], including the then little-known [[Saka language|Khotanese]]. They may be old hemp paper scrolls in Chinese and many other languages, Tibetan pothis, and paintings on hemp, silk or paper. The subject matter of the great majority of the scrolls is Buddhist in nature, but it also covers a diverse material. Along with the expected Buddhist canonical works are original commentaries, [[apocrypha]]l works, workbooks, books of prayers, [[Confucian]] works, [[Taoist]] works, [[Nestorian Christian]] works, works from the Chinese government, administrative documents, anthologies, glossaries, dictionaries, and calligraphic exercises.

Many of the manuscripts were previously unknown or thought lost, and the manuscripts provide a unique insight into the religious and secular matters of Northern China as well as other Central Asian kingdoms from the early periods up to the Tang and early Song Dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Whitfield, Susan |title=The Silk Road: Trade, Travel, War and Faith. |year=2004  |publisher=British Library, Serindia Publications |isbn=978-1-932476-13-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The manuscripts found in the Library Cave include the earliest dated printed book, the [[Diamond Sutra]] from 868, which was first translated from Sanskrit into Chinese in the fourth century. These scrolls also include manuscripts that ranged from the Nestorian [[Jesus Sutras]] to the [[Dunhuang Go Manual]] and ancient music scores, as well as the image of the [[Chinese astronomy]] [[Dunhuang map]]. These scrolls chronicle the development of Buddhism in China, record the political and cultural life of the time, and provide documentation of mundane secular matters that gives a rare glimpse into the lives of ordinary people of these eras.

The manuscripts were dispersed all over the world in the aftermath of the discovery. Stein's acquisition was split between Britain and India because his expedition was funded by both countries. Stein had the first pick and he was able to collect around 7,000 complete manuscripts and 6,000 fragments for which he paid £130, although these include many duplicate copies of the Diamond and [[Lotus Sutra]]s. Pelliot took almost 10,000 documents for the equivalent of £90, but, unlike Stein, Pelliot was a trained [[Sinology|sinologist]] literate in Chinese, and he was allowed to examine the manuscripts freely, so he was able to pick a better selection of documents than Stein. Pelliot was interested in the more unusual and exotic of the Dunhuang manuscripts, such as those dealing with the administration and financing of the monastery and associated lay men's groups. Many of these manuscripts survived only because they formed a type of [[palimpsest]] whereby papers were reused and Buddhist texts were written on the opposite side of the [[paper]]. Hundreds more of the manuscripts were sold by Wang to Otani Kozui and Sergei Oldenburg. Efforts are now underway to reconstitute the Library Cave manuscripts digitally, and they are now available as part of [[International Dunhuang Project]].

The art of Dunhuang covers more than ten major genres, such as [[architecture]], [[stucco]] sculpture, [[Mural|wall paintings]], silk paintings, calligraphy, woodblock printing, embroidery, literature, music and dance, and popular entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;Whitfield, Roderick, [[Susan Whitfield]], and Neville Agnew. "Cave Temples of Dunhuang: Art and History on the Silk Road" (2000). The British Library. {{ISBN|0-7123-4697-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Architecture===
The caves are examples of [[rock-cut architecture]], but unlike [[Longmen Grottoes]] and [[Yungang Grottoes]], the local rock is a rather soft [[gravel]] conglomerate that is not suitable for either sculpture or elaborate architectural details.&lt;ref&gt;Whitfield and Farrer, pp 13-14&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the early caves were developed from earlier Buddhist rock-cut ''[[chaitya]]'' styles seen in places such as the [[Ajanta Caves]] in India, with a square-sectioned central column, with sculpture in niches, representing the [[stupa]] round which worshippers may [[Circumambulation|circumambulate]] (''[[parikrama]]'') and gain blessings. Others are hall caves influenced by traditional Chinese and Buddhist temple architecture. These caves may have a truncated pyramidal ceiling sometimes painted to resemble a tent, or they may have a flat or gabled ceiling that imitates traditional buildings. Some of the caves used for meditation are adaptations of the Indian [[vihara]] (monastery) cave plan and contain side-chambers just large enough for one person to sit in.

Many of the caves originally had wooden porches or fore-temples built out from the cliff, but most of these have decayed or been lost in other ways, with only five remaining, the two earliest of which are rare surviving examples of Song dynasty wooden architecture. The most prominent wooden building at the site, first built during the Tang dynasty, houses the Great Buddha and was originally 4 storeys high, but it has been repaired at least 5 times and is no longer the original structure. A storey was added between 874-885, then repaired in the [[Guiyi Circuit|Guiyijun]] period, and two further storeys were added during a restoration in 1898. Two further restorations were carried out in the 20th century, and the building is now a 9-storey structure.&lt;ref name="fan jinshi1"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Caves of Dunhuang |author=Fan Jinshi |publisher=The Dunhuang Academy |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-85759-540-6 |page=124 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Murals===
[[File:Dunhuang General Zhang Yichao army detail.jpg|thumb|left|Detail of mural commemorating the victory of General [[Zhang Yichao]] over the [[Tibetan Empire]]. Cave 156, Late Tang Dynasty.]]
The murals in the caves date from a period of over a thousand years, from the 5th to the 14th century, and many earlier ones were repainted at later points within the period. The murals are extensive, covering an area of {{convert|490,000|ft2|m2|abbr=off}}. The most fully painted caves have paintings all over the walls and ceilings, with geometrical or plant decoration filling the spaces not taken by figurative images, which are above all of the [[Buddha]]. Sculpture is also brightly painted. The murals are valued for the scale and richness of content as well as their artistry. Buddhist subjects are most common, however some have traditional mythical subjects and [[donor portrait|portraits of patrons]]. These murals document the changing styles of Buddhist art in China for nearly a thousand years. The artistry of the murals reached its apogee during the Tang period, and the quality of the work dropped after the tenth century.

Early murals showed a strong Indian and Central Asian influence in the painting techniques used, the composition and style of the paintings as well as costumes worn by the figures, but a distinct Dunhuang style began to emerge during Northern Wei Dynasty.&lt;ref name=press&gt;{{cite book |title=Three Thousands Years of Chinese Paintings |author=Yang Xin, Rihard M. Branhart, Nie Chongzheng, [[James Cahill (art historian)|James Cahill]], Lang Shaojun, Wu Hung. |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-0-300-07013-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Motifs of Chinese, Central Asian and Indian origin may be found in a single cave, and Chinese elements increased during the Western Wei period.&lt;ref name=press/&gt;

A common motif in many caves is the areas entirely covered by rows of small seated Buddha figures, after which this and other "Thousand Buddhas Caves" are named. These small Buddhas were drawn using [[stencil]]s so that identical figures may be replicated. Flying [[apsara]]s, or celestial beings may be depicted in the ceiling or above the Buddhas, and figures of donors may be shown along the bottom of the walls. The paintings often depict [[jataka tales]] which are stories of the life of Buddha, or [[avadana]] which are parables of the doctrine of [[karma]].

[[File:Dunhuang Mogao mural repainted.jpg|thumb|Early mural revealed after later over-painting had been partly removed. The flesh tones of the figure with its pigments protected from oxidation contrast with the darkened tone of buddhas in later painting seen on the right. Cave 253, Northern Wei.]]

[[Bodhisattvas]] started appearing during the Northern Zhou period, with [[Avalokitesvara]] ([[Guanyin]]), which was originally male but acquired female characteristics later, the most popular. Most caves show [[Mahayana]] and [[Sravakayana]] ([[Theravada]] or [[Hinayana]]) influences, although Mahayana Buddhism became the dominant form during the Sui Dynasty. An innovation of the Sui-Tang period is the visual representation of the sutra &amp;ndash; Mahayana Buddhist teachings transformed into large complete and detailed narrative paintings.&lt;ref name="fanjinshi"/&gt;  One of the central features of Tang art in Mogao is the representation of the paradise of the [[Pure Land]], indicating the increasing popularity of this school of Mahayana Buddhism in the Tang era. The iconography of [[Vajrayana|Tantric Buddhism]], such as the eleven-headed or thousand-armed Avalokitesvara, also started to appear in Mogao wall paintings during the Tang period. It became popular during the Tibetan occupation of Dunhuang and the subsequent periods, especially during the [[Yuan dynasty]].&lt;ref name="duanwenjie"/&gt;

[[File:Dunhuang figures showing shading technique.jpg|thumb|left|Figures showing shading technique, and on the left, the effect of darkening of the paint used in shading which changed the appearance of the figure.]]
While Buddhist art is stylistically distinct from secular art, the style of paintings in the caves often reflects that of contemporary secular painting (insofar as we know of this), especially those depicting secular scenes. Donor figures are generally depicted in secular style, and may include secular events associated with them. For example, scenes depicting General [[Zhang Yichao]], who ruled over Dunhuang in a quasi-autonomous manner during the Late Tang period, include a commemoration of his victory over the Tibetans in 848. The portraits of donors increased in size during the period ruled by the Cao family who succeeded the Zhang family. The Caos formed alliances with the [[Uyghur people|Uyghur]]s ([[Uyghur Gansu Kingdom]] and [[Kingdom of Qocho]]) and the Saka [[Kingdom of Khotan]] and their portraits are featured prominently in some of the caves.&lt;ref name="dra"/&gt;

Many of the figures have darkened due to oxidation of the lead-based pigments from exposure to air and light. Many early figures in the murals in Dunhuang also used painting techniques originated from India where shading was applied to achieve a 3-dimensional or [[chiaroscuro]] effect.&lt;ref name="dra"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://public.dha.ac.cn/content.aspx?id=185436748917 |title=The Art of Dunhuang |work=Dunhuang Research Academy}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the darkening of the paint used in shading over time resulted in heavy outlines which is not what the painters had originally intended. This shading technique is unique to Dunhuang in East Asia at this period as such shading on human faces was generally not done in Chinese paintings until much later when there were influences from European paintings. Another difference from traditional Chinese painting is the presence of figures that are semi-nude, occasionally fully nude, as figures are generally fully clothed in Chinese paintings. Many of the murals have been repaired or plastered over and repainted over the centuries, and older murals may be seen where sections of later paintings had been removed.

===Sculptures===
[[File:Great Buddha, Cave 96, Mogao Caves.jpg|thumb|left|The Great Buddha of cave 96]]

There are around 2,400 surviving clay sculptures at Mogao. These were first constructed on a wooden frame, padded with reed, then modelled in clay stucco, and finished with paint. The giant statues however have a stone core. The [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] is generally shown as the central statue, often attended by [[boddhisattva]]s, [[Four Heavenly Kings|heavenly kings]], [[Deva (Buddhism)|deva]]s, and apsaras, along with [[yaksha|yaksas]] and other mythical creatures.&lt;ref name="fanjinshi"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Caves of Dunhuang |author=Fan Jinshi |publisher=The Dunhuang Academy |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-85759-540-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:Grotta nr 275.JPG|thumb|250px|Figure of [[Maitreya Buddha]] in cave 275 from [[Northern Liang]] (397-439), one of the earliest caves. The crossed ankle figure with a three-disk crown shows influence from [[Kushan]] art.]]

The early figures are relatively simple and mainly of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. The Buddhas of Northern Wei may have two attendant Bodhisattvas, and two further disciples were added in Northern Zhou, forming a group of five.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wenjie Duan|title=Dunhuang Art: Through the Eyes of Duan Wenjie|date=1 January 1994|publisher=Abhinav Publications|isbn=978-81-7017-313-7|page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Figures from the Sui and Tang periods may be present as larger groups of seven or nine, and some showed large-scale [[parinirvana]] scene with groups of mourners. The early sculptures were based on Indian and Central Asian prototypes, with some in the [[Greco-Indian]] style of [[Gandhara]]. Over time the sculptures showed more Chinese elements and became gradually sinicized.

The two giant statues represent [[Maitreya Buddha]]. The earlier and larger one in cave 96, at 35.5 m high, was constructed in 695 under the edicts from Empress Wu Zetian who instructed the constructions of monasteries in 689 and giant statues in 694. The smaller one is 27 m tall and was constructed in 713-41.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Caves of Dunhuang |author=Fan Jinshi |publisher=The Dunhuang Academy |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-85759-540-6 |page=160 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The larger northern giant Buddha was damaged in an earthquake and had been repaired and restored multiple times, consequently its clothing, colour and gestures had been changed and only the head retains its original Early Tang appearance. The southern statue however is largely in its original form apart for its right hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wenjie Duan|title=Dunhuang Art: Through the Eyes of Duan Wenjie|date=1 January 1994|publisher=Abhinav Publications|isbn=978-81-7017-313-7|page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; The larger Buddha is housed in a prominent wooden 9-storey structure.&lt;ref name="fan jinshi1"/&gt;
[[File:BeijingNationalArtMuseumofChina7.jpg|thumb|left|Reproduction of the reclining Buddha of the Tibetan period from cave 158. [[National Art Museum of China]], Beijing.]]

One type of caves constructed during the Tibetan era is the Nirvana Cave, which features a large reclining Buddha that covers the entire length of the hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wenjie Duan|title=Dunhuang Art: Through the Eyes of Duan Wenjie|date=1 January 1994|publisher=Abhinav Publications|isbn=978-81-7017-313-7|page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; Figures of mourners in murals or in sculptural forms are also depicted along the length of the hall behind the Buddha. The Buddha figure in cave 158 measures 15.6 m long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Caves of Dunhuang |author=Fan Jinshi |publisher=The Dunhuang Academy |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-85759-540-6 |pages=170–175 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original function of the "Library Cave" was as a shrine commemorating Hong Bian, the 9th-century monk. His portrait statue, unusual here and among all surviving works in China, was removed to another spot when the cave was sealed up in the 11th century, but has been returned now the library has been removed. There is also a stone [[stele]] describing his life, and the wall behind the statue is painted with attendant figure; such blending of painted sculpture and wall paintings into a single composition is very common at the site.&lt;ref&gt;Whitfield and Farrer, pp 16-17&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paintings on silk and paper===
Before the discovery in the Library Cave, original paintings on silk and paper from the Tang dynasty, a formative period in Chinese art, were very rare, and most of the surviving examples were copies made in later periods. Over a thousand paintings on silk, banners, and embroideries were found in the Library Cave, none apparently dating before the late 7th century.&lt;ref&gt;Whitfield and Farrer, p 20&lt;/ref&gt;  The great majority of the paintings are anonymous, but many are of high quality, especially from the Tang. Most are sutra paintings, images of Buddha, and narrative paintings. The paintings show something of the contemporary Chinese style of the capital [[Chang'an]], but many also reflect Indian, Tibetan and Uighur painting styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Caves of Dunhuang |author=Fan Jinshi |publisher=The Dunhuang Academy |year=2010 |page=235 |isbn=978-1-85759-540-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are brush paintings in ink alone, some in just two colours, as well as many in full colour. Most common are single figures, and most paintings were probably donated by an individual, who is often portrayed on a diminutive scale. The donor figures become notably more elaborate in dress by the 10th century.&lt;ref&gt;Whitfield and Farrer, pp 21, and numbers 41 and 42&lt;/ref&gt;

===Printed images===
[[File:Jingangjing.jpg|thumb|280px|The Chinese ''Diamond Sūtra'', the oldest known dated [[Woodblock printing|printed]] book in the world, {{IDP|Or.8210/P.2|British Library}}.]]
The Library Cave is equally important as a source of rare early images and texts produced by [[woodblock printing]], including the famous [[Diamond Sutra]], the earliest printed book to survive. Other printed images were made to be hung, often with text below containing prayers and sometimes a dedication by the pious commissioner; at least two prints were commissioned by Cao Yuanzhong, Imperial Commissioner at Dunhuang in 947. Many of the images have colour added by hand to the printed outline. Several sheets contain repeated impressions of the same block with a Buddha image. Possibly these reflect stock for cutting when sold to pilgrims, but inscriptions in some examples show these were also printed out at different times by an individual as a devotion to acquire merit. It is unclear whether such people owned their own blocks, or visited a monastery to have the images printed.&lt;ref&gt;Whitfield and Farrer, pp 99-107&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dunhuang Mogao textile embroidery.jpg|thumb|left|Detail of embroidered panel from the Library Cave. A small duck is shown in the middle among the flowers. Tang Dynasty.]]

===Textiles===
The textiles found in the Library Cave include silk banners, altar hangings, wrappings for manuscripts, and monks' apparel ([[Kasaya (clothing)|kāṣāya]]). The monks normally used fabrics consisting of a patchwork of different scraps of cloth as a sign of humility; these therefore provide valuable insights into the various type of silk cloth and embroidery available at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The British Museum Book of Chinese Art |author=Jessica Rawson |publisher=British Museum Press |year=1992 |isbn=0-7141-1453-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Silk banners were used to adorn the cliff-face at the caves during festivals, and these are painted and may be embroidered.  [[Window valance|Valances]] used to decorate altars and temples had a horizontal strip at the top, from which hung streamers made from strips of different cloths ending in a V that look like a modern male necktie.&lt;ref&gt;Whitfield and Farrer, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

==Caves==
[[File:Dunhuang mural flying apsarasa.jpg|thumb|Flying apsaras, or celestial beings. Caves 285, 538-539 AD, Western Wei Dynasty]]
The caves were cut into the side of a cliff which is close to two kilometers long. At its height, during the [[Tang Dynasty]], there were more than a thousands caves, but over time many of the caves were lost, including the earliest caves. 735 caves currently exist in Mogao; the best-known ones are the 487 caves located in the southern section of the cliff which are places of pilgrimage and worship.   248 caves have also been found to the north which were living quarters, meditation chambers, and burial sites for the monks. The caves at the southern section are decorated, while those at the northern section are mostly plain.

The caves are clustered together according to their era, with new caves from a new dynasty being constructed in different part of the cliff. From the murals, sculptures, and other objects found in the caves, the dates of around five hundred caves have been determined. Following is a list of the caves by era, compiled in the 1980s (more have been identified since):

* [[Sixteen Kingdoms]] (366-439) - 7 caves, the oldest dated to [[Northern Liang]] period.
* [[Northern Wei]] (439-534) and [[Western Wei]] (535-556) - 10 from each phase
* [[Northern Zhou]] (557-580) - 15 caves
* [[Sui Dynasty]] (581-618) - 70 caves
* Early Tang (618- 704) - 44 caves
* High Tang (705-780) - 80 caves
* Middle Tang (781-847) - 44 caves (This era in Dunhuang is also known as the [[Tibetan Empire|Tibetan]] period because Dunhuang was then under Tibetan occupation.)
* Late Tang (848-906) - 60 caves (This and the subsequent periods until the Western Xia period are also known collectively as the [[Guiyi Circuit|Guiyijun]] period (歸義軍, Return to Righteousness Army, 848-1036) when Dunhuang was ruled by the Zhang and Cao families.)
* [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period|The Five Dynasty]] (907-960) - 32 caves
* [[Song Dynasty]] (960-1035)- 43 caves
* [[Western Xia]] (1036–1226) - 82 caves
* [[Yuan Dynasty]] (1227–1368) - 10 caves

}}
'''Monochromacy''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''mono'', meaning "one "and ''chromo'', meaning "color") is the ability of organisms or machines to distinguish only one single frequency of the [[Electromagnetic spectrum|electromagnetic light spectrum]]. In the physical sense, no source of electromagnetic radiation is purely monochromatic but can be considered as a [[gaussian distribution]] of frequencies shaped around a peak. In the same way, a visual system of an organism or a machine cannot be monochromat but will distinguish a continuous set of frequencies around a peak, depending by the intensity of the light. Organisms with monochromacy are called monochromats.

Many species, such as all [[marine mammal]]s, the [[owl monkey]] and the [[Australian sea lion]] (pictured at right) are monochromats under normal conditions. In [[human]]s, absence of color discrimination or poor color discrimination is one among several other symptoms of severe inherited or acquired diseases, as for example inherited [[achromatopsia]] ([[Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man|OMIM]] 216900 262300 139340 613093), acquired achromatopsia or inherited [[blue cone monochromacy]] (OMIM 303700).

==Humans==
Vision in humans is due to a system that starts with [[rod cell|rods]] and [[cone cell|cones]] photoreceptors, passes through [[retinal ganglion cells]] and arrives in the brain [[visual cortex]]. [[Color vision]] is achieved through cone cells, each one able to distinguish between a continuous band of frequencies, retinal ganglion cells and the visual cortex.

Rods, which are extremely abundant (about 120 million), are in the periphery of the human retina. Rods respond only to faint levels of light and are very light sensitive, therefore, completely useless in daylight because bright light bleaches them.&lt;ref name="Kalat"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kalat|first=James|title=Biological Psychology|year=2013|publisher=Jon-David Hague|isbn=978-1-111-83100-4|page=158}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cones, which are mostly near the [[fovea centralis|fovea]] in the eye and are less active in dim light, more useful in bright light, are essential for color vision.&lt;ref name="Kalat" /&gt; There are three types of cones in normal human eyes (short, medium and long wavelength, sometimes called blue, green and red); each detects a different range of wavelengths. Rods outnumber cones by about 20 to 1 in the human retina, but cones provide about 90% of the brain's input.&lt;ref name="Kalat" /&gt; Cones respond faster than rods and have three types of pigments with different color sensitivities, where rods only have one and so are achromatic (colorless).&lt;ref name="Kalat" /&gt; Because of the distribution of rods and cones in the human eye, people have good color vision near the fovea (where cones are) but not in the periphery (where the rods are).&lt;ref name="Kalat" /&gt;

These types of color blindness can be inherited, resulting from alterations in cone pigments or in other proteins needed for the process of [[Visual phototransduction|phototransduction]]:&lt;ref name="NEITZ2-COL"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Neitz|first1=J|last2=Neitz|first2=M|title=The genetics of normal and defective color vision|journal=Vision Res.|date=2011|volume=51|issue=7|pages=633–651|pmid=21167193|pmc=3075382|doi=10.1016/j.visres.2010.12.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#[[Anomalous trichromacy]], when one of the three cone pigments is altered in its spectral sensitivity but [[trichromacy]] (distinguishing color by both the green-red and blue-yellow distinctions) is not fully impaired.
#[[Dichromacy]], when one of the cone pigments is missing and colour is reduced to the green-red distinction only or the blue-yellow distinction only.
# Monochromacy, when two of the cones are not functional. Vision reduced to blacks, whites, and greys.
# Rod Monochromacy ([[Achromatopsia]].), when all three of the cones are non functional and light perception is achieved only with rod cells. Color vision is heavily or completely impaired, vision reduced to seeing only the level of light coming from an object. [[Dyschromatopsia]] is a less severe type of achromatopsia.

Monochromacy is one of the symptoms of diseases that occur when only one kind of light receptor in the human [[retina]] is functional at a particular level of illumination. It is one of the symptoms of either acquired or inherited disease as for example acquired [[achromatopsia]], inherited autosomal recessive [[achromatopsia]] and [[Sex linkage#X-linked recessive inheritance|recessive X-linked]] [[blue cone monochromacy]].&lt;ref name="NATHA_BCM1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nathans|first1=J|last2=Davenport|first2=C M|last3=Maumenee|first3=I H|last4=Lewis|first4=R A|last5=Hejtmancik|first5=J F|last6=Litt|first6=M|last7=Lovrien|first7=E|last8=Weleber|first8=R|last9=Bachynski|first9=B|last10=Zwas|first10=F|last11=Klingaman|first11=R|last12=Fishman|first12=G|title=Molecular genetics of human blue cone monochromacy|journal=Science|date=1989|volume=245|issue=4920|pages=831–838|pmid=2788922|doi=10.1126/science.2788922}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NATHA_BCM2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nathans|first1=J|last2=Maumenee|first2=I H|last3=Zrenner|first3=E|last4=Sadowski|first4=B|last5=Sharpe|first5=L T|last6=Lewis|first6=R A|last7=Hansen|first7=E|last8=Rosenberg|first8=T|last9=Schwartz|first9=M|last10=Heckenlively|first10=J R|last11=Trabulsi|first11=E|last12=Klingaman|first12=R|last13=Bech-Hansen|first13=N T|last14=LaRoche|first14=G R|last15=Pagon|first15=R A|last16=Murphey|first16=W H|last17=Weleber|first17=R G|title=Genetic heterogeneity among blue-cone monochromats|journal=Am.

*Rod monochromacy (RM), also called [[Achromatopsia#Congenital|congenital complete achromatopsia]] or total color blindness, is a rare and extremely severe form of an [[autosomal recessive]]ly inherited retinal disorder resulting in severe visual handicap. People with RM have a reduced visual acuity, (usually about 0.1 or 20/200), have total color blindness, [[Photophobia|photo-aversion]] and [[nystagmus]]. The nystagmus and photo-aversion usually are present during the first months of life, and the prevalence of the disease is estimated to be 1 in 30,000 worldwide.&lt;ref name="Eksandh"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Eksandh L, Kohl S, Wissinger B | title = Clinical features of achromatopsia in Swedish patients with defined genotypes | journal = Ophthalmic Genet. | volume = 23 | issue = 2 | pages = 109–20 | date = June 2002 | pmid = 12187429 | doi = 10.1076/opge.23.2.109.2210}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, since patients with RM have no cone function and normal rod function,&lt;ref name="Eksandh" /&gt; a rod monochromat cannot see any color but only shades of grey. Also see [[Pingelap#Color-blindness]].
*Cone monochromacy (CM) is the condition of having both rods and cones, but only having one functioning type of cone. A cone monochromat can have good pattern vision at normal daylight levels, but will not be able to distinguish hues.

In humans, who have three types of cones, the short (S, or blue) wavelength sensitive, middle (M, or green) wavelength sensitive and long (L, or red) wavelength sensitive cones&lt;ref name="NATHA1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nathans|first1=J|last2=Thomas|first2=D|last3=Hogness|first3=D S|title=Molecular genetics of human color vision: the genes encoding blue, green, and red pigments|journal=Science|date=1986|volume=232|issue=4747|pages=193–202|pmid=2937147|doi=10.1126/science.2937147}}&lt;/ref&gt; have three differing forms of cone monochromacy, named according to the single functioning cone class:

#Green cone monochromacy (GCM), also known as M-cone monochromacy, is a condition where the blue and red cones are absent in the [[fovea centralis|fovea]]. The prevalence of this type of monochromacy is less than 1 in 1 million.
#Red cone monochromacy (RCM), also known as L-cone monochromacy, is a condition where the blue and green cones are absent in the fovea. Like GCM, RCM is also present in less than 1 in 1 million people. Animal research studies have shown that the nocturnal wolf and ferret have lower densities of L-cone receptors.&lt;ref name="Peichl" /&gt;

*Cone monochromacy, type II, if its existence were established, would be the case in which the retina contains no rods, and only a single type of cone. Such an animal would be unable to see at all at lower levels of illumination, and of course would be unable to distinguish hues. In practice, it is hard to produce an example of such a retina, at least as the normal condition for a species.

==Animals that are monochromats==
It used to be confidently claimed that most [[mammal]]s other than [[primate]]s were monochromats. In the last half-century, however, evidence of at least [[dichromat]]ic color vision in a number of mammalian [[order (biology)|orders]] has accumulated. While typical mammals are dichromats, with S and L cones, two of the orders of [[sea mammals]], the [[pinniped]]s (which includes the seal, sea lion and walrus) and [[cetacean]]s (which includes dolphins and whales) clearly are cone monochromats, since the short-wavelength sensitive cone system is genetically disabled in these animals.{{dubious|lacking the 2 S cone could make them dichromats|date=January 2014}} The same is true of the [[owl monkey]]s, genus ''Aotus''.

Researchers Leo Peichl, Guenther Behrmann and Ronald H. H. Kroeger report that of the many animal species studied, there are three carnivores that are cone monochromats: [[raccoon]], [[crab-eating raccoon]] and [[kinkajou]] and a few [[rodents]] are cone monochromats because they are lacking the S-cone.&lt;ref name="Peichl"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peichl|first=Leo|last2=Behrmann |first2=Gunther |last3=Kroger |first3=Ronald H.

They use the example of water depth and the smaller amount of sunlight that is visible as one continues to go down. They explain it as follows, "Depending on the type of water, the wavelengths penetrating deepest may be short (clear, blue ocean water) or long (turbid, brownish coastal or estuarine water.)" &lt;ref name="Peichl" /&gt; Therefore, the variety of visible availability in some animals resulted in them losing their S-cone opsins.

==Monochromat capability==
According to [[Jay Neitz]], a renowned color vision researcher at the [[University of Washington]], each of the three standard color-detecting cones in the retina of [[trichromat]]s can pick up about 100 gradations of color. The brain can process the combinations of these three values so that the average human can distinguish about one million colors.&lt;ref name="Roth 2006" &gt;{{cite web

[[File:Internationale Kunstausstellung Muenchen 1897.jpg|thumb|315px|Poster by [[Franz von Stuck]] for the Seventh International Art Exhibition in Munich, 1897]]
The '''Munich Secession''' was an association of visual artists who broke away from the mainstream Munich Artists' Association in 1892, to promote and defend their art in the face of what they considered official paternalism and its conservative policies. They acted as a form of [[cooperative]], using their influence to assure their economic survival and obtain commissions. In 1901, the association split again when some dissatisfied members formed the group [[Phalanx (art group)|Phalanx]]. Another split occurred in 1913, with the founding of the "New Munich Secession".

== Background ==
[[File:Franz von Lenbach.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Franz von Lenbach, the "Prince of Painters". From ''[[Die Gartenlaube]]'', c.1900]]
By the end of the Nineteenth Century, more artists lived in Munich than lived in Vienna and Berlin put together. However, the art community there was dominated by the conservative attitudes of the Munich Artists' Association and its supporters in the government. These attitudes found expression in the official "mission statements", written by the so-called "Prince of Painters" (Malerfürst) [[Franz von Lenbach]]. Matters came to a head in 1891 when the Prince-Regent  [[Luitpold, Prince Regent of Bavaria|Luitpold of Bavaria]] founded the ''Prinzregent-Luitpold-Stiftung zur Förderung der Kunst, des Kunstgewerbes und des Handwerks in München'', an art foundation devoted to promoting traditional [[history painting]] in the service of the state. This foundation created and maintained a high level of artistic quality and brought world attention to the [[Academy of Fine Arts, Munich|Academy of Fine Arts]], but was firmly opposed to [[impressionism]], [[expressionism]], [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]] and other contemporary trends in the art world.

Another factor was the complete financial failure of an exhibition in 1888 at the [[Glaspalast (Munich)|Glaspalast]], organized by the Artists' Association. This led to a bitter debate about responsibility and the exhibition's content which grew so furious, it attracted the attention of the Ministry of State for Science and Art.&lt;ref&gt;Rita Hummel: ''Die Anfänge der Münchener Secession''. Schriften aus dem Institut für Kunstgeschichte der Universität München, Vol. 46, {{ZDB|57236-6}}. Tuduv-Verlags-Gesellschaft, München 1989, {{ISBN|3-88073-345-7}}. (based on a thesis for the [[University of Munich]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

To address this situation, a group of artists with a progressive outlook gathered together in 1892, announced their separation from the official Artists' Association and established the Munich Secession, with an eye toward exhibiting at the upcoming [[World's Columbian Exposition]]. They called for a transformation in the ideas of what constitutes art and promoted the idea of an artists' freedom to present works directly to the public.

{{Zitat|"''Man soll auf unseren Ausstellungen Kunst sehen und jedes Talent, ob älterer oder neuerer Richtung, dessen Werke München zur Ehre gereichen, soll seine Blüte reich entfalten können''." (One should see, in our exhibitions, every form of art, whether old or new, which will redound to the glory of Munich, whose art will be allowed to develop to its full flowering)}}

In this statement of principles, the artists declared their intentions to move away from outmoded principles and a conservative conception of what art is.&lt;ref&gt;Clelia Segieth: ''Memorandum des Vereins Bildender Künstler Münchens''. In: Buhrs, Best: ''Secession 1892–1914'', S.&amp;nbsp;20–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Foundation ==
[[File:Bruno-piglhein.jpg|thumb|150px|Bruno Piglhein, first President of the Secession]]
On April 4, 1892, ninety-six artists who had resigned from the official Association, established the ''Association of Visual Artists of Munich''. [[Bruno Piglhein]] was elected the first President and [[Paul Hoecker]] became the first Secretary. In a few months the original name gave way to the more popular name: ''Munich Secession''.

Financial support initially came from three sources: [[Georg Hirth]], a writer and journalist who coined the word "secession" to describe the spirit of the various art movements at that time. In 1896, he would establish the [[Art-Nouveau]] magazine ''[[Jugend (magazine)|Jugend]]'' ; [[Georg von Vollmar]], editor of the [[Democratic socialism|Democratic Socialist]] party's official organ ; and Hans Viet, Graf von Toerring-Jettenbach (1862-1929), a member of the liberal opposition to the government's policies.

That same year saw the creation of another breakaway association, the ''{{ill|Luitpold-Gruppe|de}}'', composed of more moderate artists who wanted to maintain the high-quality standards of the Academy. The [[Vienna Secession]] followed five years later, and the [[Berlin Secession]] was established in 1898.

== Exhibitions ==
[[File:Ausstellungspalast, Berlin 1885.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The National Exhibition Building (ULAP), c.1885]]
At first, the Secession had some difficulty finding a building for their exhibitions. The city of Frankfurt offered to provide the necessary space and 500,000 [[German gold mark|Gold Marks]], if the group would move there permanently.&lt;ref name="Helmut Kästl"&gt;Helmut Kästl: [http://www.muenchenersecession.de/hist.php ''Historisches zur Münchener Secession''.] In: ''muenchenersecession.de'', abgerufen am 22. Juni 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Their first exhibition actually took place at Berlin's "National Exhibition Building" (now known as "[[Universum Landes-Ausstellungs-Park|ULAP]]") early in 1893.

Baurat (city construction supervisor) Franz von Brandl provided the Secession with some free land at the corner of [[Prinzregentenstraße (Munich)|Prinzregentenstraße]] and Pilotystraße. Construction began immediately and their debut exhibition took place on July 16, 1893, in the first portion of the building to be completed. Over 4,000 visitors came to see 876 works by 297 artists.

The success of this effort eventually allowed them to come to an agreement with Franz von Lenbach and the Artists' Association. As a result, the art exhibition building on the [[Königsplatz, Munich|Königsplatz]] (now the [[Staatliche Antikensammlungen]]) was transferred to the Secession in 1897.

== Later history ==
In 1933, the [[National Socialist]] party began their crusade to bring all forms of artistic expression under their control: a process known as [[Gleichschaltung]] (bringing into line). Artists were eventually required to obtain state endorsement for all of their works. Those who were considered "[[Degenerate art|degenerate]]" were not allowed to paint.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hermann Glaser]]: ''Wie Hitler den deutschen Geist zerstörte. Kulturpolitik im Dritten Reich''. Ellert&amp;nbsp;&amp; Richter, Hamburg 2005, {{ISBN|3-8319-0227-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938, the Munich Secession was dissolved as part of the "Kulturellen Säuberung" ([[cultural cleansing]]) process.

Following the end of World War II in 1946, the ''{{ill|Neue Gruppe|de}}'' and the ''Neue Münchner Künstlergenossenschaft'' (New Munich Artists' Association) were founded and led to the establishment of the ''Bundesverband Bildender Künstlerinnen und Künstler'' (Federal Association of Visual Artists).

In 1992, the Secession celebrated its centennial and, in March of the following year, the ''Society of Friends and Sponsors of the Munich Secession'' was created to support the Secession's continuing goals, maintain the "Secessionsgalerie" and promote exhibitions.

'''Music recording certification''' is a system of certifying that a music [[Sound recording|recording]] has shipped, sold, or streamed a certain number of units. The threshold quantity varies by type (such as album, [[single (music)|single]], [[music video]]) and by nation or territory (see [[List of music recording certifications]]).

Almost all countries follow variations of the [[RIAA certification]] categories, which are named after precious materials ([[gold]], [[platinum]] and [[diamond]]).

The threshold required for these awards depends upon the population of the territory where the recording is released. Typically, they are awarded only to international releases and are awarded individually for each country where the album is sold. Different sales levels, some perhaps 10 times lower than others, may exist for different music media (for example: videos versus [[album]]s, singles, or downloads).

== History ==
The original gold and silver record awards were presented to artists by their own record companies to publicize their sales achievements. The first silver disc was awarded by [[Regal Zonophone]] to [[George Formby]] in December 1937 for sales of 100,000 copies of "[[The Window Cleaner]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.georgeformby.co.uk/alan_randall/memorobilia/list.htm |title=Alan's treasured possessions |work=Alan Randall's Memorabilia |accessdate=12 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PUFMCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT54&amp;lpg=PT54 |title=George Formby: An Intimate Biography of the Troubled Genius |publisher=Lulu Press |first=David |last=Bret |page=54 |date=2014 |isbn=978-1-291-87257-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first gold disc was awarded by [[RCA Victor]] (under division imprint [[Bluebird Records]])  to [[Glenn Miller and His Orchestra]] in February 1942, celebrating the sale of 1.2 million copies of single "[[Chattanooga Choo Choo]]". Another example of a company award is the gold record awarded to [[Elvis Presley]] in 1956 for one million units sold of his single "[[Don't Be Cruel]]". The first gold record for an [[LP record|LP]] was awarded by RCA Victor to [[Harry Belafonte]] in 1957 for the album ''[[Calypso (album)|Calypso]]'' (1956), the first album to sell over 1,000,000 copies in RCA's reckoning.

At the industry level, in 1958 the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] introduced its gold record award program for records of any kind, [[LP record|albums]] or [[single (music)|singles]], which achieved one million dollars in retail sales. These sales were restricted to U.S.-based record companies and did not include exports to other countries.&lt;ref name="Venable2011"&gt;{{cite book |title=Gold: A Cultural Encyclopedia |publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]] |first=Shannon L. |last=Venable |year=2011 |isbn= 0-313-38431-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shelton1986"&gt;{{cite book |title=No Direction Home: The Life and Music of Bob Dylan |publisher=William Morrow |location=New York |first=Robert |last=Shelton |page=389 |year=1986 |isbn=0-688-05045-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; For albums in 1968, this would mean shipping approximately 250,000 units; for singles the number would be higher due to their lower retail price.&lt;ref name="Shelton1986" /&gt; The platinum certification was introduced in 1976 for the sale of one million units for albums and two million for singles, with the gold certification redefined to mean sales of 500,000 units for albums and one million for singles.&lt;ref name="White1990"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Billboard Book of Gold &amp; Platinum Records |publisher=Billboard Books |first=Adam |last=White |page=viii |date=1990 |isbn=978-0-7119-2196-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; No album was certified platinum prior to this year. For instance, the recording by [[Van Cliburn]] of [[Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto No. 1 (Van Cliburn 1958 recording)|the Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto]] from 1958 would eventually be awarded a platinum citation, but this would not happen until two decades after its release. In 1999, [[list of best-selling albums in the United States|the diamond certification]] was introduced for sales of ten million units. In the late 1980s, the certification thresholds for singles were dropped to match that of albums.&lt;ref name="White1990" /&gt;

=== RIAA certification ===
{{Main|RIAA certification}}
[[File:Artie's Gold Record.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Gold record presented to [[Artie Schroeck]] for his arrangement on "[[Can't Take My Eyes Off You]]", 1967]]
The first official designation of a "gold record" by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) was established for [[single (music)|singles]] in 1958, and the RIAA also [[trademark]]ed the term "gold record" in the United States. On 14 March 1958, the RIAA certified its first gold record, [[Perry Como]]'s hit single "[[Catch a Falling Star]]". The ''[[Oklahoma! (soundtrack)|Oklahoma!]]'' soundtrack was certified as the first gold album four months later. In 1976, RIAA introduced the platinum certification, first awarded to the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]] compilation album ''[[Their Greatest Hits (1971–1975)]]'' on 24 February 1976,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&amp;ar=Eagles&amp;ti=Their+greatest+hits&amp;lab=&amp;genre=&amp;format=&amp;date_option=release&amp;from=&amp;to=&amp;award=&amp;type=&amp;category=&amp;adv=SEARCH# |title=Gold &amp; Platinum: Eagles/Their Greatest Hits 1971 - 1975 |publisher=RIAA |accessdate=14 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to [[Johnnie Taylor]]'s single "[[Disco Lady]]" on 22 April 1976.&lt;ref name="riaa-story"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/story/ |title=Story of Gold &amp; Platinum |publisher=RIAA |accessdate=14 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&amp;ar=&amp;ti=&amp;lab=&amp;genre=&amp;format=&amp;date_option=release&amp;from=&amp;to=&amp;award=P&amp;type=&amp;category=&amp;adv=SEARCH&amp;col=certification_date&amp;ord=asc#search_section |title=Gold &amp; Platinum: Platinum Awards |publisher=RIAA |accessdate=14 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As music sales increased with the introduction of compact discs, the RIAA created the Multi-Platinum award in 1984. Diamond awards, honoring those artists whose sales of singles or albums reached 10,000,000 copies, were introduced in 1999.&lt;ref name="riaa-award-history"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/about-awards/ |title=About the Awards |publisher=RIAA |accessdate=14 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th century, and for a part of the first decade of the 21st, it was common for distributors to claim certifications based on their shipments – wholesale to retail outlets – which led to many certifications which outstripped the actual final retail sales figures. This became much less common once the majority of retail sales became paid digital downloads and digital streaming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tunecore.com/blog/2011/04/getting-a-gold-record-by-selling-nothing.html |title=Getting A Gold Record By Selling Nothing |publisher=TuneCore |first=Jeff |last=Price |date=28 April 2011 |accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Digital media certification ===
In most countries certifications no longer apply solely to physical media but now also include sales awards recognizing digital [[download]]s (in the U.S. and U.K. since 2004).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Goodbye, 2004. Hello, 2005!|url=https://www.riaa.com/newsitem.php?news_year_filter=&amp;resultpage=30&amp;id=D518ECA3-C7F5-6CDB-F346-A6E9BDEF73C9|publisher=Recording Industry Association of American|accessdate=23 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2006, the RIAA also certified the [[ringtone]] downloads of songs. Streaming from on-demand services such as [[Apple Music]],
[[Spotify]], [[Tidal (service)|Tidal]] and [[Napster (streaming music service)|Napster]] has been included into existing digital certification in the U.S since 2013 and the U.K. and Germany since 2014. In the U.S. and Germany video streaming services like [[YouTube]], [[VEVO]], and [[Yahoo! Music]] also began to be counted towards the certification, in both cases using the formula of 100 streams being equivalent to one download.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.riaa.com/newsitem.php?content_selector=newsandviews&amp;news_month_filter=5&amp;id=03662575-C88F-51CF-779C-8396A2B8D74D |title=RIAA Adds Digital Streams To Historic Gold &amp; Platinum Awards |publisher=RIAA |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924161215/http://www.riaa.com/newsitem.php?content_selector=newsandviews&amp;news_month_filter=5&amp;id=03662575-C88F-51CF-779C-8396A2B8D74D |archivedate=24 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stream"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/1560846/exclusive-on-demand-streams-now-count-toward-riaa-gold-platinum |title=Exclusive: On-Demand Streams Now Count Toward RIAA Gold &amp; Platinum|author= Alex Pham |date= 9 May 2013 |work=Billboard }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musikindustrie.de/aktuell_einzel/news/neuer-diamond-award-fuer-die-erfolgreichsten-singles-und-alben-in-deutschland/|title=Neuer DIAMOND AWARD für die erfolgreichsten Singles und Alben in Deutschland|publisher=Bundesverband Musikindstie|accessdate=15 May 2014|language=German|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140626082058/http://www.musikindustrie.de/aktuell_einzel/news/neuer-diamond-award-fuer-die-erfolgreichsten-singles-und-alben-in-deutschland/|archivedate=26 June 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other countries, such as Denmark and Spain, maintain separate awards for digital download singles and streaming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.ifpi.dk/?q=node/11|title=IFPI Denmark: Guld og platin (2014)|year=2014|publisher=[[IFPI]] Denmark|language=Danish|accessdate=31 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.promusicae.es/listas/semanales|title=Listas semanales: 14 July 2014 – 20.7.2014|publisher=[[PROMUSICAE]]|language=Spanish|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140727040623/http://www.promusicae.es/listas/semanales|archivedate=27 July 2014|date=July 2014|accessdate=21 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== IFPI certification ===
The [[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]] (IFPI) was founded in 1996, and grants the IFPI Platinum Europe Award for album sales over one million within Europe and (as of October 2009) the Middle East. Multi-platinum Europe Awards are presented for sales in subsequent multiples of one million. Eligibility is unaffected by time (from date of release), and is not restricted to European-based artists.

=== IMPALA certification ===
The [[Independent Music Companies Association]] (IMPALA) was founded in 2000 to grow the independent music sector and promote independent music in the interests of artistic, entrepreneurial and cultural diversity. IMPALA sales awards were launched in 2005 as the first sales awards recognising that success on a pan-European basis begins well before sales reach one million. The award levels are Silver (20,000+), Double Silver (40,000+), Gold (75,000+), Double Gold (150,000+), Diamond (200,000+), Platinum (400,000+) and Double Platinum (800,000+).

== Certification thresholds ==
{{Main|List of music recording certifications}}

[[File:Gold Record.jpg|thumb|Boy band [[Plus One (band)|Plus One]] displaying their gold records]]
Below are certification thresholds for the United States, United Kingdom, Canada and France. The numbers in the tables are in terms of "units", where a unit represents one sale or one shipment of a given medium. Certification is often awarded cumulatively, and it is possible for a single album to be certified silver, gold, and platinum in turn. An album that becomes Platinum twice over, for example, an album which has sold 2,000,000 copies in the United States, is said to be "Double-Platinum", or sometimes "Multi-Platinum". Since 2013 in the U.S.,&lt;ref name="stream" /&gt; and 2014 in the U.K.&lt;ref name="occ20140622"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/uks-official-singles-chart-to-include-streaming-data-for-first-time__4245/ |title=UK's Official Singles Chart to include streaming data for first time |publisher=Official Charts Company |first=Lauren |last=Kreisler |date=22 June 2014 |accessdate=12 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Germany,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/digital-and-mobile/5862334/streaming-tally-joins-germanys-official-charts|work=Billboard|date=7 January 2014|title=Streaming Tally Joins Germany's Official Charts|first=Wolfgang|last=Spahr}}&lt;/ref&gt; streaming of songs counts towards certification of singles with 150 streams being the equivalent of 1 unit sold.&lt;ref name="occ20140622"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/business/6859551/riaa-streaming-gold-platinum-certification-methodology |title=RIAA Accepts Streams for Gold and Platinum Certifications |work=Billboard |date=1 February 2016 |accessdate=12 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since February 2016, RIAA includes on-demand audio and video streams and a track sale equivalent in Gold and Platinum Album Award.

The plaques themselves contain various items under the glass. Modern awards often use CDs instead of records. Most gold and platinum records are actually vinyl records which have been [[Vacuum metallizing|vacuum metallized]] and tinted, while trimmed and plated metal "masters", "mothers", or "stampers" (metal parts used for pressing records out of vinyl) were initially used. The music in the grooves on the record may not match the actual recording being awarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/154422901/ |title=All That Music is Not Gold |work=Reno Gazette-Journal |page=65 |date=12 March 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individual plaque-makers produced their awards according to available materials and techniques employed by their graphic arts departments. The plaques, depending on size and elaborateness of design, cost anywhere between [[US$]]135 and $275, most often ordered and purchased by the record label that issued the original recording.

'''National Book Tokens''' are a [[book token]] that is available in the UK and Ireland. They are solely owned and issued by Book Tokens Ltd (part of the Booksellers Association Group of Companies).

National Book Tokens are sold and accepted for exchange in almost all UK bookshops, including all major chains.

The Book Tokens scheme was established in 1932, by publisher Harry Raymond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/nov/17/weekend.lucymangan|title=An appreciation of a token|first=Lucy|last=Mangan|date=17 November 2007|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original format of the tokens was as "lick-and-stick" stamp-like vouchers, which were glued into gift cards and had to be removed by the bookseller redeeming the token. In the 1990s, this design was changed to a "currency-style" voucher, available in a number of different denominations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalbooktokens.com/about-us/gallery/Brief-History.aspx|title=National Book Tokens|website=National Book Tokens}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a redesign in 2003 the Book Tokens scheme was relaunched as National Book Tokens, with new vouchers designed by LMC Design. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketingmagazine.co.uk/news/rss/186570/Book-Tokens-unveils-redesign-ahead-national-push/|title=Campaign: marketing, advertising and media news &amp; analysis|website=www.marketingmagazine.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the paper vouchers were phased out. They were replaced by National Book Token [[gift card|gift cards]] which were identified by a [[bar code]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebookseller.com/news/busy-first-day-electronic-gift-cards.html?quicktabs_1=0|title='Busy' first day for electronic gift cards - The Bookseller|website=www.thebookseller.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Parmigiani Fleurier SA''' ({{IPA-fr|paʁmiʒani flœʁje}}) is a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] brand of luxury [[watchmaker]]s founded in 1996 in [[Fleurier]], [[Switzerland]], by Michel Parmigiani. In 2006, Parmigiani produced the Bugatti 370, a driving watch which won the 2006 "Watch of the Year Award" from the [[Japan]]ese press, supposedly based on the [[Bugatti Veyron]] supercar.

==History==
Parmigiani Fleurier was started in 1996 in [[Val-de-Travers]]. Founder Michel Parmigiani had conceived the brand as far back as 1976 through his work restoring watchmaking artefacts and his detailed knowledge of historical mechanical clocks and watches.

==Watches==
Parmigiani carries a men's line of watches, and a line that caters specifically to women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.europastar.com/europastar/magazine/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003119871|title= Mechanical watches for ladies |accessdate=2008-02-05 |last= Strandberg|first= Keith W.|work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.europastar.com/europastar/magazine/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002274745|title= Charm offensive at Parmigiani |accessdate=2008-02-05 |last= Maillard|first= Pierre|work= }}&lt;/ref&gt; All Parmigiani Fleurier watches are hand-made, taking at least four hundred hours to put together;&lt;ref name= tourbillion&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.tourbillon-watches.com/tourbillon.asp?pg=editorial/2002/parmigiani.htm&amp;house=49|title= Parmigiani Fleurier |accessdate=2008-02-05 |format= |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt; they are constructed with only [[precious metal]]s{{what|date=April 2015}} and [[gemstone|precious]] or semi-precious stones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.americanwatchguild.com/manufacturer_detail.php?id=197|title= Parmigiani-Fleurier |accessdate=2008-02-05 |format= |work= American Watch Guild.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to create exclusivity, only a few thousand pieces are produced every year.&lt;ref name = luxury&gt;{{cite web |url= http://theluxurybazaar.com/timepieces/webforms/watches/brand/brand.aspx?c=0318c28a-3e0b-4854-b17d-1dd0d67df26c|title= Parmigiani Fleurier|accessdate=2008-02-05 |format= |work= Luxury Bazaar.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their watch lines include the Toric, Forma (renamed Kalpa) and the single watch, the Bugatti 370.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.europastar.com/europastar/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003594012|title= Parmigiani's new Kalpa'graph |accessdate=2008-02-05 |last= Strandberg|first= Keith W.|work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Senfine concept==

In 2016, Parmigiani-Fleurier presents the Senfine concept housing a new escapement taking advantage of the properties of silicon flat springs. The revolutionary concept uses an oscillator with high frequency and low amplitude for enhanced precision and power reserve.&lt;ref&gt;Monochrome-watches, [https://monochrome-watches.com/a-technical-perspective-the-evolution-of-the-escapement-and-recent-innovations "The evolution of the escapement and recent innovations"], February 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pfaltzgraff''' is an [[United States|American]] [[kitchenware]] brand that sells quality dinnerware, serveware, drinkware and flatware.

== History ==
It is commonly reported that the Pfaltzgraff company was founded in 1811 in [[York County, Pennsylvania]],&lt;ref name=walsh-stetler&gt;{{citation|editor-last=Walsh|editor-first=David A.|editor2-last=Stetler|editor2-first=Polly|title=Pfaltzgraff: America's Potter|publisher=Historical Society of York County; Pfaltzgraff Company|year=1989|location=York, PA}}&lt;/ref&gt; by several members of the Pfaltzgraff family who were [[Pottery|potters]], though the most notable member was [[Johann George Pfaltzgraff]], who arrived in York County from Germany in 1833. Johann, having come from a family of potters, knew the trade, and passed his skills on to his seven sons. After Johann died in 1873, three of his children, John, George, and Henry, were still carrying on the business. The business became official in 1889 when George and Henry started a partnership that would become ''The Pfaltzgraff Co.'' The first factory was built in 1895.

The business continued to grow, and in 1960, Pfaltzgraff opened their first [[retail store]] under the name ''Pottery Hill.'' During the 1950s and 1960s, the products were mostly sold in [[specialty store]]s, but in the 1970s, the business made a strategic decision to sell in higher-end [[department store]]s, such as [[G Fox]] and [[Macy's]]. Several lines of Pfalzgraff glazed earthenwares have featured among the 100 most popular ceramic designs.&lt;ref&gt;"Appendix A: 100 Most Popular Patterns" listed from the records of Replacements.com and illustrated in ''Dish: 813 Colorful, Wonderful Dinner Plates''  Shax Riegler. 2011. pp256ff.&lt;/ref&gt; A large [[Murals of York, PA#The History of Pottery|mural depicting Pfaltzgraff's history]] was painted in York, Pennsylvania in 1998. The Pfaltzgraff Co. was sold to [[Lifetime Brands]], Inc. in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://multichannelmerchant.com/news/Pfaltzgraff-sold-Lifetime-0605/ |title=Pfaltzgraff Co. Sold to Lifetime Brands |accessdate=2008-04-17 |last=Fischer |first=John |date=2005-06-20 |work=Multichannel Merchant |publisher=Penton Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until recently, the company owned and operated 67 stores throughout the U.S. as well as their online presence at www.pfaltzgraff.com. In 2009, Lifetime Brands opted to close all 67 stores and only maintain their Internet presence.  All the stores, most of which were outlet stores, were liquidated and closed.  The product line currently includes dinnerware, glassware, flatware, and other kitchen preparatory and cooking tools.

'''Polystylism''' is the use of multiple [[music genre|style]]s or [[wikt:technique|techniques]] in literature, art, film, or, especially, music, and is a [[postmodern]] characteristic.

Some prominent [[contemporary music|contemporary]] polystylist composers include [[Peter Maxwell Davies]]&lt;ref&gt;John Webb, "Schnittke in Context" ''Tempo'' New Series/182, September 1992. 19-22.

''Perspectives of New Music'' 36. no. 1 (Winter 1998): 5–41, citation on 24-26.&lt;/ref&gt; Polystylist composers from earlier in the twentieth century include [[Charles Ives]]&lt;ref&gt;Nachum Schoffman, "Charles Ives's Song 'Vote for Names', ''Current Musicology'' 23 (1977): 56–68.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Erik Satie]].&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Albright, "Postmodern Interpretations of Satie's ''Parade''", ''Canadian University Music Review/Revue de Musique des Universités Canadiennes'' 22, no. 1 (2002): 22–39.&lt;/ref&gt; Among literary figures, [[James Joyce]] has been referred to as a polystylist.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolph von Abele, "Film as Interpretation: A Case Study of ''Ulysses''", ''Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism'' 31 (1973): 487–500, citation on 495.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though perhaps not the original source of the term, the first important discussion of the subject is Alfred Schnittke's essay "Polystylistic Tendencies in Modern Music (1971)".&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Schnittke, "Polystylistic Tendencies in Modern Music (1971)", in ''A Schnittke Reader'', edited by Aleksandr Ivashkin, English translation by John Derek Goodliffe, 87–90 (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2002) {{ISBN|0-253-33818-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-253-33818-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The composers cited by Schnittke as those who make use of polystylism are [[Alban Berg]], [[Luciano Berio]], [[Pierre Boulez]], [[Edison Denisov]], [[Hans Werner Henze]], [[Mauricio Kagel]], [[Jan Klusák]], [[György Ligeti]], [[Carl Orff]], [[Arvo Pärt]], [[Krzysztof Penderecki]], [[Henri Pousseur]], [[Rodion Shchedrin]], [[Dmitri Shostakovich]], [[Sergei Slonimsky]], [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]], [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Boris Tishchenko]], [[Anton Webern]], and [[Bernd Alois Zimmermann]].

[[File:Pomander 3.jpg|thumb|Venetian woman with a pomander]]

A pomander, from [[French language|French]] ''pomme d'ambre'', i.e., apple of amber, is a ball made for perfumes, such as [[ambergris]] (whence the name), [[musk]], or [[civet (perfumery)|civet]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=46}} The pomander was worn or carried in a vase, also known by the same name, as a protection against [[infection]] in times of pestilence or merely as a useful article to modify bad smells.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=46}} The globular cases which contained the pomanders were hung from a neck-chain or belt, or attached to the girdle, and were usually perforated in a variety of [[openwork]] techniques, and made of gold or silver.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=46}} Sometimes they contained several partitions, in each of which was placed a different perfume.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=46}}

The term "pomander" can refer to the scented material itself or to the container that which contains such material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.larsdatter.com/pomanders.htm|title=Pomanders|work=larsdatter.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.silvercollection.it/dictionarypomander.html POMANDER MEMENTO MORI]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Corine Schleif and Volker Schier, ''Katerina's Windows: Donation and Devotion, Art and Music, as Heard and Seen Through the Writings of a Birgittine Nun,'' University Park: Penn State Press, 2009, pp. 237, 242-244&lt;/ref&gt; The container could be made of gold or silver and eventually evolved to be shaped like nuts, skulls, hearts, books and ships. Smaller versions were made to be attached by a chain to a finger ring and held in the hand. Even smaller versions served as cape buttons or rosary beads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ganoksin.com/article/small-wonders-aromatic-adornments/|title=Small Wonders – Aromatic Adornments|publisher= ganoskin|accessdate= 12 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A pomander can be a bag containing fragrant herbs and might be viewed as an early form of [[aromatherapy]]. Pomanders can be considered related to [[censer]]s, in which aromatics are burned or roasted rather than naturally evaporated.

==History==
Pomanders were first mentioned in literature in the mid-thirteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/bulletin_of_hispanic_studies/v086/86.1.twomey.html|title=Project MUSE - The Bulletin of Hispanic Studies - Perfumes and perfume-making in the Celestina|work=jhu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were used in the late [[Middle Ages]] through the 17th century.&lt;ref name="groom274"&gt;Groom, p. 274&lt;/ref&gt;
Also a version of the pomander with oranges, [[clove]]s, oils, and a golden ribbon can be used as a recovery charm in witchcraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hearth-n-home.blogspot.com/2011/12/pomander-recovery-spell-and-charm.html|title=Hearth-n-Home: Pomander Recovery spell and charm|author=Mamma Kay|work=hearth-n-home.blogspot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://begumafreedaali.blogspot.com/2013/08/a-magical-pomander.html|title=A-Magical Pomander ~ Begum Afreeda Ali|work=begumafreedaali.blogspot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://witcheslore.com/bookofshadows/rituals-spell-casting/magic-and-spell-casting/2537/|title=Magic and Spell-Casting - Witchcraft - Pagan, Wiccan, Occult and Magick|work=witcheslore.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spellsofmagic.com/coven_spells.html?coven=6&amp;slist=7|title=Cure Spells|work=SpellsOfMagic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval===
Pomanders were first made for carrying as religious keepsakes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guyotbrothers.com/jewelry-history/jewelry-history-page11.htm Jewelry of the middle ages]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renaissance===
The ''Archaeological Journal'', Volume 31 of 1874 describes on page 339 a 1584 formula for making a pomander that was also published by [[Frederic Madden]] in his 1831 history book ''Privy purse expenses of the Princess Mary, daughter of [[King Henry the Eighth]], afterwards [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary]]'' on page 257:

{{Quote|[[Benzoin resin]], [[calamite]], [[labdanum]], and [[storax balsam]] were ground into a powder, dissolved in [[rose water]] and put into a pan over a fire to cook together. The cooked mixture was then removed from the fire, rolled into an apple shape and coated with a powdered mixture of cinnamon, sweet sanders, and cloves.

After this, a concoction was made from three grains each of [[ambergris]], [[deer musk]], and [[civet (perfumery)|civet musk]]. The ambergris was dissolved first and the deer and civet musk mixed in later. The "apple" ball was rolled through the musk concoction to blend in these ingredients and then kneaded to combine and molded back into the shape of an apple.&lt;ref&gt;Longman, p. 339&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Madden, p. 257&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Nostradamus====
[[Michel de Nostredame]] had a similar method and formula using similar ingredients, but a rather different procedure.

"Rose tablets" were made by soaking a pound of roses without the flower heads in [[deer musk]] water overnight. The water was then thoroughly squeezed out and the roses ground with seven ounces of [[benzoin resin|benzoin]], a quarter of [[ambergris]] and another of [[civet (perfumery)|civet musk]]. This mixture was made into tablets, which were each sandwiched between rose petals and dried in a cool, dark area&lt;ref name=Boeser11&gt;Boeser (chapter 11)&lt;/ref&gt;

To form the final pomander, two ounces of the purest [[labdanum]], an ounce each of [[Styrax]] calamites and benzoin resin, half an ounce of the rose tablets, one ounce of violet powder, and half a [[dram (unit)|dram]] each ambergris and musk were ground into a powder and kneaded with the rose-musk water from the production of the rose tablets. This produced "an aromatic ball of the most supreme perfume, and the longest-lasting that can be made anywhere in the world."&lt;ref name=Boeser11/&gt;

====Pouncet box====
In the late 16th century the pouncet box appeared which, whilst retaining the traditional features of the pomander, was designed to hold liquid perfumes, blended with powder and absorbed on a sponge or piece of cotton. It was favoured by the upper classes who appreciated the delicacy of the liquid perfumes. Its name stemmed from the fact that the box was "pounced" or pierced to release the scent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ganoksin.com/article/small-wonders-aromatic-adornments/|title=Small Wonders – Aromatic Adornments|publisher=Ganoskin|accessdate=12 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern===
[[File:Orange pomander.jpg|thumb|An orange studded with [[clove]]s.]]

One modern style of pomander is made by studding an orange or other fruit with whole dried [[clove]]s and letting it [[curing (food preservation)|cure dry]], after which it may last several years. This modern pomander serves the functions of perfuming and freshening the air and also of keeping drawers of clothing and linens fresh, pleasant-smelling, and moth-free.

==Ingredients==
Other ingredients in the process of making pomanders are:

==Culture==
A pomander is worn by [[Mia Farrow|Rosemary Woodhouse]], in [[Roman Polanski]]'s 1968 film, ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]''. It figures as a central part of the plot development.

The pouncet box is mentioned in Shakespeare's ''[[Henry IV Part I]]'' when Hotspur is accused of withholding Scottish nobles captured in a skirmish and in self-defence pleads, in describing the King's messenger:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
::He was perfumèd like a milliner,
::And ’twixt his finger and his thumb he held
::A pouncet box, which ever and anon
::He gave his nose and took’t away again,
::Who therewith angry, when it next came there,
::Took it in snuff; and still he smiled and talked.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Etymology==
Medieval pomander paste formulas usually contained ambergris. From this came "pomme ambre" (amber apple) and from there the word ''pomander'' was developed.&lt;ref name="groom274"/&gt; Other names for the pomander are Ambraapfel, Bisamapfel, Bisamknopf, Bisambüchse, balsam apple, Desmerknopf, musk ball Desmerapfel, Oldanokapsel, Pisambüchse, and smelling apple.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12902">'''Post Occupancy Evaluation''' (POE) has its origins in [[Scotland]] and the [[United States]] and has been used in one form or another since the 1960s. Preiser and colleagues define POE as: &lt;blockquote&gt;the process of evaluating buildings in a systematic and rigorous manner after they have been built and occupied for some time" &lt;/blockquote&gt;The unique aspect of Post Occupancy Evaluation is that it generates recommendations based on all stakeholder groups' experiences of subject buildings' affects on productivity and wellbeing. &lt;ref&gt;Preiser, W. F., White, E., &amp; Rabinowitz, H. (2015). ''Post-Occupancy Evaluation (Routledge Revivals)''. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purposes of POE==
Post Occupancy Evaluations is used to improve the ways that buildings are used to support productivity and wellbeing.

Specifically it is used to:
* Account for building quality
* Inform planning and briefing (programming) for new buildings and alterations
* Troubleshoot building/use problems (such as change management and new work styles)

The [[British Council for Offices]] (BCO)&lt;ref&gt;Oseland N A (2007) ''British Council for Offices Guide to Post-Occupancy Evaluation''. London: BCO.&lt;/ref&gt; summarises that a POE provides [[feedback]] of how successful the workplace is in supporting the occupying organization and the requirements of individual end-users. The BCO also suggests that POE can be used to assess if a project brief has been met. Furthermore, the BCO recommends that POE is used as part of the [[Evidence-based design]] process, where the project usually refers to a [[building design]] fit-out or refurbishment, or to inform the project brief where the project is the introduction of a new initiative, system or process. POE usually involves feedback from the building occupants, through questionnaires, interviews and workshops, but may also involve more objective measures such as environmental monitoring, space measurement and cost analysis.

==Building interest groups==
Post Occupancy Evaluations involve all stakeholder groups with interests in the subject buildings. Stakeholders are typically:
* [[Employees]] - working in the buildings
* [[Customer|Clients]], customers, students, prisoners, guests and patients - receiving services in the buildings
* [[Executive sponsor|Project sponsors]], [[Architect|architects]], engineers, builders - who produced the building
* Maintenance managers, tradespeople and cleaners - who maintain the building
* Future generations (represented by architects) - who will live in the environmental polluted by the buildings' construction and operation

==Components of POE==
The POE process provides value-neutral prompts to stimulate stakeholders to make testable observations about their experiences of buildings' effect on productivity and wellbeing. These observations are clarified and documented by the evaluator. Stakeholders' testable observations will be specific to building design, use and operating conditions and these may involve "negotiation" of all three dimensions of building evaluation to realize the optimum ways of achieving productivity and wellbeing.

Recommendations are based on complete set of stakeholders' observations. Most recommendations are to inform planning and design of future new buildings the operational practices. They also generate some recommendations for modifications to the subject buildings and for changes in the ways that they are used. POE evaluators may recommend monitoring, research, investigation or project management studies.

Some POE include other building studies. POE incorporate may include [[Quantitative research|quantitative]] and [[qualitative research|qualitative]] techniques. Most POEs will involve seeking feedback from the occupants of the place being evaluated; this may be achieved through various [[survey methodology]] including [[questionnaire]], [[interview]] or [[focus group]]. The occupant feedback may be supplemented by [[environmental monitoring]], such as temperature, noise levels, lighting levels and indoor air quality. More recently, POEs tend to include sustainable measures such as energy consumption, waste levels, and water usage. Other commonly used quantitative measures include space metrics, for example occupational density, space utilization and tenant efficiency ratio. Cost, either expressed as the cost of the project per square meter or the total cost of occupancy, is considered a key metric in building evaluation and may be compared with the occupant feedback to provide a better understanding of value.

==Certification scheme==
Both [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] and [https://www.wellcertified.com/enWELL WELL] consider occupant surveys as part of their certification scheme. 

=== LEED v4 ===
[[Building science|IEQ]] survey, as a part of POE, is involved in [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] certification scheme v4. For all LEED [[Maintenance (technical)|O+M]] projects using LEED v4, one point (EQ Credit: Occupant Comfort Survey) can be awarded to those who intents to assess building occupants' comfort.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.usgbc.org/sites/default/files/LEED%20v4%20EBOM_01.5.18_current.pdf|title=LEED v4 for BUILDING OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE|last=|first=|publisher=U.S. Green Building Council|year=2018|isbn=|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== WELL v2 ===
WELL involves the occupant survey in both preconditions&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://v2.wellcertified.com/v2.2/en/community/feature/3|title=Occupant Survey|last=|first=|date=|website=International WELL Building Institute|archive-url=https://v2.wellcertified.com/v2.2/en/community/feature/3|archive-date=2018-11-17|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and optimization&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://v2.wellcertified.com/v2.2/en/community/feature/4|title=Enhanced Occupant Survey|last=|first=|date=|website=International WELL Building Institute|archive-url=https://v2.wellcertified.com/v2.2/en/community/feature/4|archive-date=2018-11-17|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; features in the concept of community. Besides, it has a particular feature related to occupant survey on [[thermal comfort]] concept&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://v2.wellcertified.com/v2.1/en/thermal%20comfort/feature/2|title=Enhanced Thermal Performance|last=|first=|date=|website=International WELL Building Institute|archive-url=https://v2.wellcertified.com/v2.1/en/thermal%20comfort/feature/2|archive-date=2018-11-17|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==== Occupant Survey ====
Occupant Survey (Feature C03) is one of the precondition features of the community concept, which means it is mandatory for certification. This feature intends to establish minimum standards for the evaluation of experience and self-reported health and well-being of building occupants. The requirements of this feature are the following two parts&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;:

* Part 1: Select project survey. This can be either a third-party survey, or a custom survey;
* Part 2: Administer survey and report results.

==== Enhanced Occupant Survey ====
Enhanced Occupant Survey (Feature C04) is an optimization feature of community concept, which helps to achieve WELL certification. The purpose of this feature is to evaluate comfort, satisfaction, behavior change, self-reported health and other robust factors related to the well-being of occupants in buildings. A project can have up to 3 points  it meets below requirements&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;:

* Part 1: Select enhanced survey. This survey can be one of the pre-approved surveys in Feature C03 Part 1 with either additional one to three modules specific to WELL or additional  three to six project related topics (1 point);
* Part 2: Administer pre-occupancy survey and report results (1 point);
* Part 3: Monitor survey responses (1 point);
* Part 4: Facilitate interviews and focus groups (1 point).

==== Enhanced Thermal Performance ====
Enhanced Thermal Performance (Feature T02) is one of the optimization features of thermal comfort concept. This feature aims to enhance thermal comfort and promote human productivity by ensuring that a substantial majority of building users (above 80%) perceive their environment as thermally acceptable. The maximum points are three, and there are achieved by following parts&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;:

* Part 1:  Enhanced thermal environment. This is achieved by meeting specific standards (1 point);
* Part 2: Achieve thermal comfort. A post-occupancy survey should be administered at least twice a year to check whether regular occupants are satisfied with the thermal performance or not.

==POE at any stage after building occupancy==
The term "post occupancy" can be confusing and simply refers to an occupied building rather than a vacant one. Furthermore, POEs may be conducted at regular intervals to monitor how the building facilities and its operation are currently supporting the occupants. A pre-project POE may be used to:

* Document ways in which stakeholders experience buildings
* To inform the briefing and [[design process]] for proposed buildings and building alterations
* To negotiate and resolve new building features and qualities, which compromise productivity and well being
* Measure a dimension of project success
* [[feedback]] and feed-forward
* Set a baseline for measurement
* Establish [[wikt:benchmark|benchmark]] data
* Input to the [[change management]] programme and to align change management and design
* Highlight where future investments may be best placed, and best avoided

A POE is often carried out six to twelve months after construction work is complete and buildings are occupied. Post Occupancy Evaluations are also undertaken at any time buildings' "lives"; particularly to understand stakeholders' experience of them, for briefing alterations and changes.

==Any built environment accommodating people==
POE's have been conducted of facilities for schools, universities, technical institutes, kindergartens, museums, offices, courts, corrections, military, hospitals, landscape/civil works, learning environments,&lt;ref&gt;Barlex M J (2006) ''Guide to Post Occupancy Evaluation''. London: HEFCE/AUDE.&lt;/ref&gt; libraries,&lt;ref&gt;Lackney J A and Zajfen P (2005) Post-occupancy evaluation of public libraries: Lessons learned from three case studies. ''Library Administration and Management, 19(1)''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Enright S (2002) Post-occupancy evaluation of UK library building projects. ''Liber Quarterly, 12,'' pp 26-45.&lt;/ref&gt; jails,&lt;ref&gt;Wener R E (1994) ''Post Occupancy Evaluation Procedure: Instruments &amp; Instructions for Use''. Orange County Corrections Division and National Institute of Correction Jail Centre.&lt;/ref&gt; police stations,&lt;ref&gt;Home Office (2009) ''Design Policy, Post Occupancy Evaluation: North Kent Police''. London: Home Office.&lt;/ref&gt; housing,&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson, F and Leaman A 2010) Housing occupancy feedback: Linking performance with behaviour. ''Building Research and Information, 38 (5).''&lt;/ref&gt; health centres&lt;ref&gt;Carthey J (2006) Post occupancy evaluation: Development of a standardised methodology for Australian health projects. ''The International Journal of Construction Management'', pp 57-75.&lt;/ref&gt; and zoos.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson M et al (2003) Post-occupancy evaluation of zoo Atlanta's Giant Panda Conservation Center. ''Zoo Biology, 22 (4) pp 365-363.''&lt;/ref&gt; It would be equally possible to apply POE techniques to ships and "virtual" environments. POE has been applied to selected parts of buildings, aspects of buildings and groups of buildings on the same campus and several sites.

==Independent evaluation==
POE is usually carried out by architects or building professionals with a [[social science]] or [[workplace consulting]] background. POE by independent [[consultant]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s can offer an impartial evaluation.

==Other building studies==
POE can be informed by reference to other building studies and POEs sometimes recommend other studies such as:
* [[Energy audit]]
* [[Survey (human research)]]
* [https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newPPM_74.htm Post Implementation Review]
* Proprietary building rating schemes
* Noise measurements
* [[Indoor air quality|Indoor Air Quality]] measurements
* [[Benefits realisation management]]
* Building (maintenance) inspection
* [[Life-cycle assessment]]
* [[Valuation (finance)|Valuation]]
* Environmental rating schemes ([[BREEAM]], [[Green Star (Australia)|Green Star]], [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]])

==Relevant Organisations==
POE has been developed and discussed within these organisations:
* [[International Association of People-Environment Studies|International Association for People-Environment Studies]]
* [http://www.edra.org/ Environment Design Research Association]
*[[Center for the Built Environment]]

{{Expand Persian|کتاب کوچه|date=January 2010}}
'''''The Book of Alley''''' ({{lang-fa|کتاب کوچه}} ''Ketâb-e Kucheh'') is a series of books about [[Persian language|Persian]] idioms and proverbs by [[Ahmad Shamlou]] coauthored with his wife [[Aida Sarkisian]].

==History==

[[Ahmad Shamlou|Shamlou]] devoted four decades of his life to collecting and organizing [[Iranian folklore]]. Folklore from his perspective is a body of traditional beliefs, customs, and expressions. The language in general, and oral languages in particular, address it through different uses such as proverbs, laments, cries and so on. Therefore the language could be used as an index to folklore as a body of tradition. The research work entitled ''Ketab Kuche ''(Translation: ''The Book of Alley'') indexes the Iranian folklore through the Persian language. The book is a multi-volume, multi-disciplinary work designed as a major source of information, providing a detailed and accurate picture of an important world civilization over a span of several thousand years. ''Ketab Kuche'' is one of the third Iranian national projects on Persian heritage and language beside the [[Encyclopædia Iranica]], a multi-disciplinary reference work and research tool designed to record the facts of Iranian history and civilization and the [[Dehkhoda dictionary]], the largest comprehensive Persian dictionary ever published, comprising 15 volumes. 14 volumes of this book were printed during his lifetime.

After Shamlou's death, his wife [[Aida Sarkisian]] took responsibility for the book.

'''''The Diving Bell and the Butterfly''''' (original French title: ''Le Scaphandre et le Papillon'') is a [[memoir]] by journalist [[Jean-Dominique Bauby]]. It describes what his life is like after suffering a massive [[stroke]] that left him with [[locked-in syndrome]]. It also details what his life was like before the stroke.

The French edition of the book was published on March 7, 1997. It received excellent{{peacock term|date=October 2018}} reviews, sold the first 25,000 copies on the day of publication, reaching 150,000 in a week. It went on to become a number one bestseller across Europe. Its total sales are now in the millions. 
== Plot summary ==
On December 8, 1995, Bauby, the editor-in-chief of French ''[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]'' magazine, suffered a stroke and lapsed into a [[coma]]. He awoke 20 days later, mentally aware of his surroundings, but physically paralyzed with what is known as [[locked-in syndrome]], with the only exception of some movement in his head and eyes. His right eye had to be sewn up due to an irrigation problem. The entire book was written by Bauby blinking his left eyelid, which took ten months (four hours a day). Using [[partner assisted scanning]], a transcriber repeatedly recited a [[French language]] [[Letter frequencies|frequency-ordered alphabet]] (E, S, A, R, I, N, T, U, L, etc.), until Bauby blinked to choose the next letter. The book took about 200,000 blinks to write and an average word took approximately two minutes. The book also chronicles everyday events for a person with locked-in syndrome. These events include playing at the beach with his family, getting a bath, and meeting visitors while in hospital at [[Berck-sur-Mer]]. On March 9, 1997, two days after the book was published, Bauby died of [[pneumonia]].&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;Thomas, Rebecca.

== Chapters ==
{{Long plot|section|date=January 2018}}
* '''Prologue:''' Jean-Dominique Bauby begins by detailing his rousing in room 119 at the Maritime Hospital at Berck the morning a year after the stroke that led to his [[locked-in syndrome]]. He recalls the days that followed and the resulting limitations: paralysis and blinking in his left eyelid. His mind on the other hand is active and he prepares for the publisher’s emissary arrival, though his thoughts are interrupted a nurse.
* '''The Wheelchair:''' He is visited by many medical professionals. His situation hasn’t fully sunken in and he does not fully understand the connotation of the wheelchair. It isn’t until a comment is made by the occupational therapist that it becomes clear to him.
* '''Prayer:''' There are only 2 patients at Berck that have locked-in syndrome. His case is unique in that he maintains the ability to turn his head. He hopes to improve his respiration and regain his ability to eat without a gastric tube; as well as possibly to be able to speak again. His friends and family have dedicated to all kinds of religions and spiritual deities on his recovery, and he has assigned specific parts of his body to some too.
* '''Bathtime:''' His physical therapist arrives for the exercise, “mobilization,” where his limbs are moved. He has lost 60 pounds in twenty weeks. He notes that he has more mobilization in his head as he can rotate it 90 degrees. He recounts that even with limited facial expression, he still has varying emotions each time he is cleaned or given a bath.
* '''The Alphabet:''' He describes the creation, use, and precision of the alphabet he uses to communicate. ESARINTULOMDPCFB VHGJQZYXKW. He ordered the letters from the most common to the least in the French language. His visitors read the alphabet and when he hears the letter he wishes for them to write down, he blinks his left eye. This is not without its challenges though.
* '''The Empress:''' [[Eugénie de Montijo|Empress Eugenie]], wife of Napoleon III, was the patroness of the hospital, which contains various depictions of her. He tells of an imperial visit on May 4, 1864, where he imagines himself beside her. In one of the depictions, he sees a reflection that he finds disfigured but then realizes that it is his.
* '''Cinecittà:''' The author describes the location of the Maritime Hospital at Berck which is in the [[Pas-de-Calais|Pas de Calais]]. On one occasion that he is being wheeled through the hospital corridors he spots a corner of the hospital which contains a lighthouse which he names Cinecittà.
* '''Tourists:''' The author says Berck, the hospital, focused primarily on the care of young tuberculosis patients following the Second World War. It has now shifted toward older patients, which make up most of the hospital's population. He refers to Tourists as those who spend a short time in the hospital following injuries such as broken limbs. For him, the best place to observe this is in the rehabilitation room and the interactions he has with these patients.
* '''The Sausage:''' He doesn’t pass his dietary test, as yogurt enters his airway, so he “eats” through a tube connected to his stomach. His only taste of food is in his memories where he imagines himself cooking dishes. One food is the sausage which connects to a memory from his childhood. 
* '''Guardian Angel:''' The author refers to Sandrine, his speech therapist, who has developed this communication code for him. He undergoes speech therapy with her and is in the process of regaining vocal language. He listens to his daughter, Céleste, his father, and Florence speak to him on the phone but he is unable to reply. 
* '''The Photo:''' The last time the author saw his father was a week before his stroke where he had shaved him. He describes his aging father in this chapter. He receives calls from his father from time to time. He recalls a photograph from his father on the back of which was written ''[[Berck|Berck-sur-Mer]], April 1963.''  
* '''Yet Another Coincidence:''' The author identifies with [[Alexandre Dumas]]' character from [[The Count of Monte Cristo]], Noirtier de Villefort. As this character is on a wheelchair and must blink to communicate, Noirtier might be the first case of locked-in syndrome in literature. The author would like to write a modern take of this classic, where Monte Cristo is a woman. 
* '''The Dream:''' He recounts a dream in which he and his friend, Bernard, are trudging through thick snow as they try to return to France even as it is paralyzed by a general strike. Then Bernard and he have an appointment with an influential Italian businessman whose headquarters are in the pillar of a viaduct. Upon entering the headquarters, he meets the watchman Radovan Karadzic, a Serbian leader. Bernard tells that the author is having trouble breathing and the Serbian leader is performs a [[tracheotomy]] on him. They have drinks at the headquarters and he discovers that he has been drugged. The police arrive and as everyone tries to escape, he finds himself unable to move - only a door separates him from freedom. He tries to call for his friends but he cannot speak, realizing that reality has permeated the dream. 
* '''Voice Offstage:''' He awakens one morning to find a doctor sewing his right eyelid shut, as the eyelid no longer functions and risks an ulceration of his right cornea. He mulls over how, like a pressure cooker, he must contain a delicate balance of resentment and anger which leads him to the suggestion of a play he may base on his experiences, though the man in the play will have a final scene where he gets up and walks, but a voice says, "Damn! It was only a dream!"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Bauby, J. (1998). The Diving Bell and the Butterfly (First Vintage International ed.). New York: Random House, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''My Lucky Day:''' He describes a day where, for half an hour, the alarm on the machine that regulates his feeding tube has been beeping non-stop, his sweat has unglued the tape on his right eyelid causing his eyelashes to tickle his eye, and the end of his urinary catheter has come off and he is drenched. A nurse ends up finally coming in. 
* '''Our Very Own Madonna:''' The author tells the story of his pilgrimage to [[Lourdes]] with Josephine in the 1970s. During the trip, he argued with Josephine repeatedly. Later, while traveling through the town, the two see a statue of the Madonna, the Holy Virgin. He buys it for her although later they know they will separate. He attempts to read the book, The Trace of the Serpent, he notices that Josephine has written a letter on every page, so that collectively they read: "I love you, you idiot. Be kind to your poor Josephine."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 
* '''Through a Glass, Darkly:''' Théophile and Céleste visit the author for Father's Day with their mother Sylvie, Bauby's ex-wife. They head to the beach outside the hospital. He observes his children but is filled with sorrow as he cannot touch his son. He plays hangman with Théophile while Céleste puts on a show of acrobatics and song. They spend their day on the beach until it is time for his children to go. 
* '''Paris:''' His old life burns within him like a dying ember. Since his stroke, he has traveled twice to Paris. The first time he went, he passed the building where he used to work as Elle's editor-in-chief, which makes him weep. The second time though, about four months later, he felt indifferent but knew nothing was missing except for him. 
* '''The Vegetable:''' He recounts the opening to a letter he has sent to friends and associates, about sixty people, which make up the first words of his monthly letter from Berck. In his absence, rumors in Paris said that he had turned into a vegetable, of which he wished to dispel. This monthly letter allows him to communicate with his loved ones, the letters he receives in return he reads himself and keeps like a treasure. 
* '''Outing:''' Weeks or months have passed since Bauby has ventured outside the hospital. On this day, he is accompanied by his old friend, Brice, and Claude, the person who he is dictating the book to. Though the journey is rough on his butt and winding, he keeps moving toward his goal. Meanwhile, he contemplates how his universe is divided into those who knew him before the stroke and all others. Drawing closer to his destination, he sees Fangio, a patient of the hospital who cannot sit so he must remain standing or laying down. His destination ends up being a place that serves french fries, a smell which he doesn't tire of. 
* '''Twenty to One:''' He tells two stories in this chapter: of an old horse called [[Mirtha-Grandchamp]] and of the arrival of his friend Vincent. Over a decade ago, Vincent and he had gone to a race where it was rumored the horse Mirtha-Grandchamp would win. They had both planned to bet on the horse but the betting counter had closed before they were able to make a bet. The horse ends up winning.
* '''The Duck Hunt:''' Bauby has hearing problems. His right ear is completely blocked whereas his left distorts all sound that is more than ten feet away. The loud activities and patients of the hospital hurt his ears, but once they are gone, he can hear butterflies in his head. 
* '''Sunday:''' Bauby dreads Sundays as there as no visitors of any sort, friends or hospital staff, besides the rare nurse. He receives a bath and is left to watch TV, though he must choose wisely as the wrong program or sound can hurt his ears, and it'll be long before someone comes in and is able to change the channel. The hours stretch and he is left to contemplate. 
* '''The Ladies of Hong Kong:''' He loves traveling and has banks of memories and smells to recall. The one place he has not visited though is Hong Kong, as various events would keep him from going. He imagines his colleagues there and how his assumed superstitious nature of the culture would treat him. 
* '''The Message:''' He contrasts the cafeteria population to his side of the hospital. Then, mentions a typewriter that sits with a blank pink empty slip. He is convinced that a message will be on it for him one day and he waits. 
* '''At the Wax Museum:''' He has a dream of visiting the [[Musée Grévin]]. The museum has changed a lot and is distorted. Rather than contemporaries figures, the various personnel he encounters in the hospitable adorn the museum. He has given them all nicknames. He then goes on to the next exhibit which is a recreation of his hospital room excepts his pictures and posters on his wall contain stills of people he recognizes. He is then woken by a nurse asking if he wants his sleeping pill. 
* '''The Mythmaker:''' The author tells of an old schoolyard friend, Olivier, known for his runaway mythomania where he would claim to have spent his Sunday with Johnny Hallyday, gone to London to see the new James Bond, or had been driving the latest Honda.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Just as Olivier wove stories about himself, Bauby now imagines himself a Formula One driver, a soldier, or a cyclist. 
* '''"A Day in the Life":''' He describes the day of his stroke, Friday, December 8, 1995. As he traveled to work, he listened to the Beatles song, [[A Day in the Life]]. Once he leaves work, he goes to pick up his son Théophile to take him to the theater but, on his way, his vision and mind blur. He makes it near where his sister-in-law, Diane, who is a nurse, lives. He sends his son to get her and she takes him to a clinic where he is taken in by doctors. His final thoughts before slipping into a coma involve the night he was to have with his son and where his son had gone off to. 
* '''Season of Renewal:''' Summer is ending: it is now September and the author describes the events that come with it. He can now grunt a song about a kangaroo; an ability which he attributes to his speech therapy. Claude rereads the pages of text that they have written together of the past two months and he wonders whether it is enough to fill a book. He closes the book with, "Does the cosmos contain keys for opening up my diving bell? A subway line with no terminus? A currency strong enough to buy my freedom back? We must keep looking. I'll be off now."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Film adaptations==
In 1997, [[Jean-Jacques Beineix]] directed a 27-minute television documentary, "Assigné à résidence" (released on DVD in the U.S. as  "Locked-in Syndrome" with English subtitles), that captured Bauby in his paralyzed state, as well as the process of his book's composition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.film-documentaire.fr/4DACTION/w_fiche_film/3739_1 Film-documentaire.fr]&lt;/ref&gt;

Artist/director [[Julian Schnabel|Julian Schnabel's]] [[The Diving Bell and the Butterfly (film)|feature-film adaptation]] of the book was released in 2007, starring [[Mathieu Amalric]] as Bauby. The film was nominated for several international awards and won best director that year at the Cannes Film Festival&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.altfg.com/blog/awards/60th-cannes-film-festival-awards/ Cannes Film Festival Awards 2007: Alternative Film Guide]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/BasicSearchInput.jsp Academy Awards Database] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921143432/http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/BasicSearchInput.jsp |date=2008-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bafta.org/awards/film/nominations/?year=2007 BAFTA Awards Database]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goldenglobes.org/browse/film/26136 HFPA Awards Database]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9467">{{redirect|The Golden Axe|other uses|Golden Axe (disambiguation)}}
'''The Honest Woodcutter''', also known as '''Mercury and the Woodman''' and '''The Golden Axe''', is one of [[Aesop's Fables]], numbered 173 in the [[Perry Index]]. It serves as a cautionary tale on the need for cultivating honesty, even at the price of self-interest.

==The story==
The Greek version of the story tells of a woodcutter who accidentally dropped his axe into a river and, because this was his only means of livelihood, sat down and wept. Taking pity on him, the god [[Hermes]] (also known as [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]]) dived into the water and returned with a golden axe. "Was this what you had lost?", Hermes asked, but the woodcutter said it was not, and returned the same answer when a silver axe was brought to the surface. Only when his own tool is produced does he claim it. Impressed by his honesty, the god allows him to keep all three. Hearing of the man's good fortune, an envious neighbor threw his own axe into the river and wailed for its return. When Hermes appeared and offered him a golden axe, the man greedily claimed it but was denied both that and the return of his own axe.

Though the tale's moral is that 'Honesty is the best policy', as the English proverb has it, there existed a medieval Byzantine proverb apparently alluding to the fable, which stated that 'A river does not always bring axes'. But since this was glossed to mean that no person always acts consistently, it is obviously at a considerable remove from the story's application.&lt;ref name="Hansen2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=William F. Hansen|title=Ariadne's Thread: A Guide to International Tales Found in Classical Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ezDlXl7gP9oC&amp;pg=PA44|accessdate=2013-04-14|year=2002|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=0-8014-3670-2|page=44|chapter=Hermes and the Woodcutter}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sequence of ideas that led to this understanding of the fable also exposes the gap in the envious neighbor's logic. He had observed the [[proximate and ultimate causation|proximate cause]] for enrichment, namely dropping an axe in the river, and overlooked the ultimate cause - the need for scrupulous honesty. The right combination of circumstances had to be there for Hermes to act as he did. Without them, as the neighbor eventually learned, 'the river does not always bring (golden) axes'. 

A burlesque retelling of the fable occurs in [[François Rabelais]]'s 16th-century novel ''[[Gargantua and Pantagruel]]''. It takes up most of the author's prologue to the 4th Book and is considerably extended in his typically prolix and circuitous style. The woodcutter's cries disturb the chief of the gods as he deliberates the world's business and he sends Mercury down with instructions to test the man with the three axes and cut off his head if he chooses wrongly. Although he survives the test and returns a rich man, the entire countryside decides to follow his example and gets decapitated. So, Rabelais concludes, it is better to be moderate in our desires. Much the same story is told in [[La Fontaine's Fables]] (V.1) but in more concentrated form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.readbookonline.net/readOnLine/19785 |title=An English version |publisher=Readbookonline.net |date= |accessdate=2013-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, rather than beheading the woodman's imitators, Mercury merely administers a heavy blow.

==The fable in the arts==
Some paintings named from the fable have been broad landscapes with small figures added in the middle plane. [[Salvator Rosa]]'s ''Mercury and the Dishonest Woodman'' in the [[National Gallery]], London, dates from about 1650.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/salvator-rosa-landscape-with-mercury-and-the-dishonest-woodman |title=Salvator Rosa &amp;#124; Landscape with Mercury and the Dishonest Woodman &amp;#124; NG84 &amp;#124; The National Gallery, London |publisher=Nationalgallery.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; An 18th-century watercolour by George Robertson (1748–88) seems to derive from this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icollector.com/George-Robertson-1748-1788-watercolour-Mercury-and-The-Woodman-9-5-x-15-5-ins_i5078639 |title=George Robertson (1748-1788) watercolour, Mercury and The Woodman, 9.5 x 15.5 ins |publisher=Icollector.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles-André van Loo]] gives greater prominence to the figures in his ''Mercure présentant des haches au bûcheron'' in the [[Hôtel de Soubise]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.insecula.com/oeuvre/photo_ME0000063203.html |title=Mercure présentant des haches au bûcheron |publisher=Insecula.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025055023/http://www.insecula.com/oeuvre/photo_ME0000063203.html |archivedate=2012-10-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this the god hovers in mid-air and presents the axes to the surprised and kneeling woodman. 

Illustrations of the fable on English chinaware draw on the woodcut in [[Samuel Croxall]]'s edition of Aesop. A Wedgwood plate of about 1775 displays a red picture in a square, garlanded frame. The rim has a wavy edge printed with detached sprays of flowers. Much the same picture as there, printed in green, is used on a contemporary Liverpool tile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://collections.vam.ac.uk/search/?listing_type=&amp;offset=0&amp;limit=15&amp;narrow=&amp;q=mercury+and+the+woodman&amp;commit=Search&amp;quality=0&amp;objectnamesearch=&amp;placesearch=&amp;after=&amp;after-adbc=AD&amp;before=&amp;before-adbc=AD&amp;namesearch=&amp;materialsearch=&amp;mnsearch=&amp;locationsearch= |title=Both are on display in the Victoria and Albert Museum |publisher=Collections.vam.ac.uk |date=2013-04-02 |accessdate=2013-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the left foreground, Mercury is presenting an axe to the seated woodman. In the distance, on the opposite bank, his dishonest neighbour has raised his axe before throwing it into the river. 

In 1987 the story was included on the 40 drachma value of the eight-stamp set of Aesop's fables issued by Greece and features the naked god seated on a rock in the river and offering the three axes to the bearded woodman on the bank.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.creighton.edu/aesop/artifacts/stamps/greece Creighton University]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other versions==
The appearance of other tellings of the story, with local variations, from [[Nigeria]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tcdZB_qga58C&amp;q=honesty+and+dishonesty#v=snippet&amp;q=honesty%20and%20dishonesty&amp;f=false|last=Aare |first=Emmanuel |title=African Tales|chapter=Honesty and Dishonesty|page=18 |isbn=978-1-60808-000-7 |publisher=WriteLife LLC |date=1 December 2008 |accessdate=2013-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thailand]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=raupectOnCkC&amp;q=honest+woodcutter#v=snippet&amp;q=honest%20woodcutter&amp;f=false|isbn=1-56308-096-6 |chapter=The Honest Woodcutter |title=Thai Tales |first1=Supaporn |last1=Vathanaprida |first2=Margaret |last2=MacDonald |first3=Boonsong |last3=Rohitasuke |page=42 |publisher=Libraries Unlimited |date=1994 |accessdate=2013-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tibet]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b3jVISrJayEC&amp;q=golden+axe#v=snippet&amp;q=golden%20axe&amp;f=false|title=Essentials of modern literary Tibetan: a reading course and reference grammar |last1=Goldstein|first1=Melvin|last2=Rimpoche|first2=Gelek|last3=Phuntshog|first3=Lobsang|chapter=The Golden Axe|page=208|isbn=0-520-07622-2 |publisher=University of California Press |date=7 August 1991 |accessdate=2013-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; seems to call in question the purely Greek origin of the story. The Thai account claims to originate from a Buddhist [[Jataka]] tale but gives no source for a comparison to be made. Since the main lines of the story in all three are the same as in Aesopic versions, one might infer that, whatever their original form, they have since been influenced by the European model. 

A certain kinship has also been observed between the fable and the account of the miraculous recovery of an axe from a river in the [[Tanakh|Jewish Bible]]. There the prophet [[Elisha]] was travelling with some members of a religious community 'and when they came to the Jordan, they began cutting down trees; but it chanced that as one man was felling a trunk, the head of his axe flew off into the water. "Oh master," he exclaimed, "it was a borrowed one." "Where did it fall?" asked the man of God. When he was shown the place, he cut off a piece of wood and threw it in and made the iron float.' (NEB, Kings II, 6.4-6)

'''''The Prelude or, Growth of a Poet's Mind; An Autobiographical Poem''''' is an [[autobiography|autobiographical]] poem in [[blank verse]] by the English poet [[William Wordsworth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Wordsworth|first=William |title=The Prelude or, Growth of a Poet's Mind; An Autobiographical Poem|edition=1|work=Internet Archive|publisher=Edward Moxon, Dover Street|publication-date=1850|publication-place=London|url=https://archive.org/stream/prelude00unkngoog#page/n9/mode/2up|accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intended as the introduction to the more [[philosophical poets|philosophical]] poem ''The Recluse,'' which Wordsworth never finished, ''The Prelude'' is an extremely personal work and reveals many details of Wordsworth's life.

Wordsworth began ''The Prelude'' in 1798, at the age of 28, and continued to work on it throughout his life. He never gave it a title, but called it the "Poem (title not yet fixed upon) to [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]]" and in his letters to [[Dorothy Wordsworth]] referred to it as "the poem on the growth of my own mind". The poem was unknown to the general public until the final version was published three months after Wordsworth's death in 1850. Its present title was given to it by his widow Mary. It is widely regarded as Wordsworth's [[Masterpiece|greatest work]].

==Versions==
There are three versions of the poem:
* The 1799 ''Prelude'', called the ''Two-Part Prelude'', composed 1798–99, containing the first two parts of the later poem.
* The 1805 ''Prelude'', which was found and printed by [[Ernest de Sélincourt]] in 1926, in 13 books.
* The 1850 ''Prelude'', published shortly after Wordsworth's death, in 14 books.

''The Prelude'' was the product of a lifetime: for the last part of his life Wordsworth had been "polishing the style and qualifying some of its radical statements about the divine sufficiency of the human mind in its communion with nature".&lt;ref name="The Norton"&gt;''The Norton Anthology of English Literature'' 323.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure: ''The Prelude'' and ''The Recluse''==
The poem was intended as the prologue to a long three-part epic and philosophical poem, ''The Recluse''.  Though Wordsworth planned this project when he was in his late 20s, he went to his grave at 80 years old having written to some completion only ''The Prelude'' and the second part (''[[The Excursion]]''), and leaving no more than fragments of the rest.

Wordsworth initially planned to write this work together with [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], their joint intent being to surpass [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' (''Table Talk'' II.70–71; IG3).&lt;!--I know this makes little sense--I lifted this reference from the text as I found it.--&gt; If ''The Recluse'' had been completed, it would have been about three times longer than ''Paradise Lost'' (33,000 lines versus 10,500). Wordsworth often commented in his letters that he was plagued with agony because he had failed to finish the work.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} In his introduction to the version of 1850 Wordsworth explains that the original idea, inspired by his "dear friend" Coleridge, was "to compose a philosophical Poem, containing views of Man, Nature, and Society, and to be entitled the ''Recluse''; as having for its principal subject, the sensations and opinions of a poet living in retirement".&lt;ref name="The Poems"&gt;''The Poems of William Wordsworth'' 237.&lt;/ref&gt;

Coleridge's inspiration and interest is evident in his letters. For instance, in 1799 he wrote to Wordsworth: "I am anxiously eager to have you steadily employed on 'The Recluse'... I wish you would write a poem, in blank verse, addressed to those who, in consequence of the complete failure of the French Revolution, have thrown up all hopes of amelioration of mankind, and are sinking into an almost Epicurean selfishness, disguising the same under the soft titles of domestic attachment and contempt for visionary philosophies. It would do great good, and might form a Part of 'The Recluse'." (STC to WW, Sept. 1799).

Wordsworth pays tribute to Coleridge in his introduction to the edition of 1850: "work [is] addressed to a dear friend, most distinguished for his knowledge and genius, and to whom the author's intellect is deeply indebted."&lt;ref name="The Poems" /&gt;

==Literary critic on ''The Prelude''==
According to Monique R. Morgan's "Narrative Means to Lyric Ends in Wordsworth's ''Prelude''," "Much of the poem consists of Wordsworth's interactions with nature that 'assure[d] him of his poetic mission.' The goal of the poem is to demonstrate his fitness to produce great poetry, and ''The Prelude'' itself becomes evidence of that fitness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1353/nar.0.0009 |title=Narrative Means to Lyric Ends in Wordsworth's ''Prelude'' |year=2008 |first1=Monique R. |last1=Morgan |journal=Narrative |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=298–330}}&lt;/ref&gt; It traces the growth of the poet's mind by stressing the mutual consciousness and spiritual communion between the world of nature and man.

==Content==
The work is a poetic reflection on Wordsworth's own sense of his poetic [[vocation]] as it developed over the course of his life. Its focus and mood present a sharp and fundamental fall away from the neoclassical and into the Romantic. [[John Milton|Milton]], who is mentioned by name in line 181 of Book One, rewrote God's [[Genesis creation myth|creation]] and [[The Fall of Man]] in ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' in order to "justify the ways of God to men," Wordsworth chooses his own mind and imagination as a subject worthy of epic.

This [[spiritual autobiography]] evolves out of Wordsworth's "persistent [[metaphor]] [that life is] a circular journey whose end is 'to arrive where we started / And know that place for the first time' ([[T. S. Eliot]], ''[[Little Gidding (poem)|Little Gidding]]'', lines 241-42).  ''The Prelude'' opens with a literal journey [during his manhood] whose chosen goal [...] is the Vale of [[Grasmere (village)|Grasmere]]. ''The Prelude'' narrates a number of later journeys, most notably the crossing of the [[Alps]] in Book VI and, in the beginning of the final book, the climactic ascent of [[Snowdon]]. In the course of the poem, such literal journeys become the metaphorical vehicle for a spiritual journey—the quest within the poet's memory [...]".&lt;ref name="The Norton" /&gt;

'''''The Women''''' is a 1939 American [[comedy-drama|comedy-drama film]] directed by [[George Cukor]]. The film is based on [[Clare Boothe Luce]]'s [[The Women (play)|play of the same name]], and was adapted for the screen by [[Anita Loos]] and [[Jane Murfin]], who had to make the film acceptable for the [[Production Code]] for it to be released.

The film stars [[Norma Shearer]], [[Joan Crawford]], [[Rosalind Russell]], [[Paulette Goddard]], [[Joan Fontaine]], [[Lucile Watson]], [[Mary Boland]], [[Florence Nash]], and [[Virginia Grey]], as well as [[Marjorie Main]] and [[Phyllis Povah]], the last two of whom reprised their stage roles from the play. [[Ruth Hussey]], [[Virginia Weidler]], [[Butterfly McQueen]], and [[Hedda Hopper]] also appeared in smaller roles. Fontaine was the last surviving actress with a credited role in the film; she died in 2013. &lt;!-- as per check of IMDb bios for the film's actresses. --&gt;

The film continued the play's all-female tradition—the entire cast of more than 130 speaking roles was female. Set in the glamorous Manhattan apartments of high society evoked by [[Cedric Gibbons]], and in Reno, Nevada, where they obtain their divorces, it presents an acidic commentary on the pampered lives and power struggles of various rich, bored wives and other women they come into contact with.

Throughout ''The Women'', not a single male is seen — although the males are much talked about, and the central theme is the women's relationships with them. Lesbianism is intimated in the portrayal of only one character, Nancy Blake ("I am an old maid, a frozen asset."). The attention to detail was such that even in props such as portraits, only female figures are represented, and several animals which appeared as pets were also female. The only exceptions are a poster-drawing clearly of a bull in the fashion show segment, a framed portrait of Stephen Haines as a boy, a figurine on Mary's night stand, and an ad on the back of the magazine Peggy reads at Mary's house before lunch.

Filmed in black and white, it includes a 6-minute fashion parade filmed in [[Technicolor]], featuring [[Adrian (costume designer)|Adrian]]'s most ''outré ''designs; often cut in modern screenings, it has been restored by Turner Classic Movies. On DVD, the original black-and-white fashion show, which is a different take, is available for the first time.

==Plot==
''The Women'' follows the lives of Manhattan women, focusing in particular on Mary Haines, the cheerful, contented wife of Stephen and mother of Little Mary. After a bit of gossip flies around the salon these wealthy women visit, Mary's cousin Sylvia Fowler goes to a salon to get the newest, exclusive nail color: Jungle Red. She learns from a manicurist that Mary's husband has been having an affair with a predatory perfume counter girl named Crystal Allen. A notorious gossip, Sylvia delights in sharing the news with Mary's friends; she sets up Mary with an appointment with the same manicurist so that she hears the rumor about Stephen's infidelity.

While Mary's mother urges her to ignore the gossip, Mary begins to have her own suspicions about her husband's increasingly frequent claims that he needs to work late. She decides to travel to Bermuda with her mother to think about the situation and hope the rumors will fade. Upon her return, Mary heads to a fashion show and learns that Crystal is in attendance, trying on clothes in a dressing room. Mary, at Sylvia's insistence, confronts her about the affair, but Crystal is completely unapologetic and slyly suggests that Mary keep the status quo unless she wants to lose Stephen in a divorce. Heartbroken and humiliated, Mary leaves quickly. The gossip continues, exacerbated by Sylvia and her friend Edith, who turns the affair into a public scandal by recounting Sylvia's version of the story to a notorious gossip columnist. Mary chooses to divorce her husband despite his efforts to convince her to stay. As she is packing to leave for Reno, Mary explains the divorce to Little Mary.

On the train to Reno, where she will get her divorce, Mary meets several women with the same destination and purpose: the dramatic, extravagant Countess de Lave; Miriam Aarons, a tough-cookie chorus girl; and, to her surprise, her friend Peggy Day, a shy young woman. Mary and her new friends settle in at a Reno ranch, where they get plenty of unsolicited advice from Lucy, the gruffly warm-hearted woman who runs the ranch. The Countess tells tales of her multiple husbands and seems to have found another prospect in Reno, a cowboy named Buck Winston. Miriam reveals she has been having an affair with Sylvia Fowler's husband and plans to marry him. Peggy, who has discovered that she is pregnant, is urged to call her husband, resolve their misunderstanding, and end the divorce proceedings. She succeeds. Sylvia arrives at the ranch, now that her husband has requested a divorce ("Well, girls: move over"). When she discovers that Miriam is to become the new Mrs. Fowler, a catfight ensues. Mary succeeds in breaking up the fight. Miriam convinces her that she, too, should forget her pride, get her husband on the phone, and try to patch things up before their divorce becomes legal in a few hours. Before Mary can decide, it rings — the call is from Stephen, who informs Mary that Crystal and he have just been married.

Two years pass. At the Haines apartment, Crystal, now Mrs. Haines, is taking a bubble bath and talking on the phone to her lover, who turns out to be Buck Winston, now the husband of the Countess and a successful radio star. Little Mary overhears the conversation before being shooed away by Crystal, who, not surprisingly, has no time or patience for the child. Sylvia figures out with whom Crystal has been speaking and is having an affair. Still an unrelenting gossip, Sylvia tucks this information away for later use. Mary hosts a dinner for her Reno friends to celebrate the two-year anniversary of the Countess and Buck, after which the Countess, Miriam, and Peggy go to a nightclub and urge Mary to come along. Mary decides to stay home. She chats with Little Mary, who inadvertently reveals how unhappy Stephen is and mentions Crystal's "lovey dovey" talk with Buck on the telephone. This news changes Mary's mind about the party. She gets dressed up, intent on fighting to get her ex back: "I've had two years to grow claws, Mother -- Jungle Red!"

At the nightclub (in the ladies' room), Mary worms the details of the affair out of Sylvia, then makes sure that a gossip columnist (played by a real-life one, [[Hedda Hopper]]) is alerted to it. Mary tells the Countess that her husband Buck has been having an affair with Crystal, then informs Crystal that everyone knows what she has been doing. Crystal does not care and tells Mary she can have Stephen back, since she will now have Buck to support her. The Countess reveals that she has been funding Buck's radio career and that with Crystal, he will be penniless and out of a job. Crystal resigns herself to the fact that she will be heading back to the perfume counter, adding: "And by the way, there's a name for you ladies, but it isn't used in high society -- outside of a kennel."

Mary, triumphant, heads out the door and up the stairs to win back Stephen, who is waiting for her.

==Production==
In January 1937, producers Harry M. Goetz and [[Max Gordon (producer)|Max Gordon]] bought the film rights to the play for $125,000 and planned on turning it into a [[Claudette Colbert]] vehicle, with [[Gregory LaCava]] as the director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=509&amp;category=Notes|title=Notes|work=Turner Classic Movies|accessdate=April 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1938, [[Norma Shearer]] and [[Carole Lombard]] were in negotiations to star.&lt;ref&gt;"Looking at Hollywood", ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', March 2, 1938&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1938, it was announced [[Jane Murfin]] was busy writing the film's screenplay at MGM. [[Virginia Weidler]] was cast on April 24, 1939.&lt;ref&gt;"Robert Donat Named as 'Ruined City' Star", ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', April 25, 1939&lt;/ref&gt; [[F.

===Technicolor sequence===
''The Women'' has one color sequence by Technicolor, a scene featuring a fashion show. When interviewed by TCM host Robert Osborne, director George Cukor stated that he did not like the sequence and that he wanted to remove it from the film.

==Reception==
The film was commercially successful and was cited as one of the best of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Frost|first=Jennifer |title=Hedda Hopper's Hollywood: Celebrity Gossip and American Conservatism|year=2011|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=0-814-72823-5|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it received no [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations, many critics now describe it as one of the major films of what was a stellar year in Hollywood film production. On Rotten Tomatoes, ''The Women'' holds a 91% "Fresh" rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{rotten-tomatoes|1023906-women|The Women}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Box office===
According to MGM records the film earned $1,610,000 in the US and Canada and $660,000 elsewhere but because of its high production cost ultimately incurred a loss of $262,000.&lt;ref name="Mannix"/&gt;  However, the film was re-released in 1947 and earned a small profit of $52,000.

===Cultural impact===
In 2007, ''The Women'' was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/film/registry_titles.php "National Film Registry"]. ''[[Library of Congress]]'', accessed October 28, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Actress [[Anna Kendrick]] considers the film to be her favorite film to watch, calling it “a wildly funny all female cast and a female writer. I revisit it almost every year and my appreciation for the performances and the writing grows.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/five-favorite-films-with-anna-kendrick/ FIVE FAVORITE FILMS WITH ANNA KENDRICK]&lt;/ref&gt; She later reiterated her love for the film, several years later.&lt;ref&gt;[https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/anna-kendricks-five-favorite-films/ ANNA KENDRICK'S FIVE FAVORITE FILMS]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parody==
On his November 5, 1939 radio broadcast, Jack Benny presented a sketch parody of ''The Women'' with all the male cast members in female roles and [[Mary Livingstone]] as the announcer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jack Benny: The Jell-O Program Starring Jack Benny---1939|url=https://archive.org/details/JackBennyTheJell-oProgramStarringJackBenny---1939|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Remakes==
It was remade as a 1956 musical comedy titled ''[[The Opposite Sex]]'', starring [[June Allyson]], [[Joan Collins]], and [[Ann Miller]].

In 1960, MGM toyed with the idea of doing an all-male remake of ''The Women'' which would have been entitled, ''Gentlemen's Club''. Like the female version, this would have involved an all masculine cast and the plot would have involved a man ([[Jeffrey Hunter]]) who recently discovers among his friends that his wife is having an affair with another man ([[Earl Holliman]]) and after going to Reno to file for divorce and begin a new life, he later finds himself doing what he can to rectify matters later on when he discovers that the other man is only interested in money and position and he decides to win his true love back again. Although nothing ever came of this, it would have consisted of the following ensemble: Jeffrey Hunter (Martin Heal), Earl Holliman (Christopher Allen), [[Tab Hunter]] (Simon Fowler), [[Lew Ayres]] (Count Vancott), [[Robert Wagner]] (Mitchell Aarons), [[James Garner]] (Peter Day), [[Jerry Mathers]] (Little Martin), [[James Stewart]] (Mr. Heal), [[Ronald Reagan]] (Larry), [[Troy Donahue]] (Norman Blake), and [[Stuart Whitman]] (Oliver, the bartender who spills the beans about the illicit affair).

In 1977 it was remade by [[Rainer Werner Fassbinder]] for German television as ''Women in New York''.

In 2008, [[Diane English]] wrote and directed [[The Women (2008 film)|a remake of the same title]], her feature film directorial debut. The comedy starred [[Meg Ryan]], [[Eva Mendes]], [[Annette Bening]], [[Jada Pinkett Smith]], [[Bette Midler]], and [[Debra Messing]], and was released in 2008 by Picturehouse Entertainment, a sister company to Warner Bros. (the current owners of the 1939 version through Turner Entertainment).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117972296.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1&amp;query=diane+english | work=Variety | title=Femmes front 'Women' | first=Michael | last=Fleming | date=September 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It holds a 13% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{rotten-tomatoes|10009516_women|The Women}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Theatre Royal''' was a theatre in [[Aldershot]] in [[Hampshire]] which opened in 1891 and was demolished in 1959. The teenage [[Charlie Chaplin]] appeared there in 1904 and the actor [[James Mason]] is believed to have made his stage début at the theatre in 1931.&lt;ref name=Sweeney&gt;Sweeney, Kevin.

Located on the corner of Gordon Road and Birchett Road in Aldershot, the Theatre Royal replaced the Apollo Music Hall which had been on the corner of Union Street and Grosvenor Road in Aldershot from 1856 until it was destroyed by a fire in February 1889&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visitoruk.com/Aldershot/19th-century-T1799.html Timeline History of Aldershot - Welcome to Aldershot website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Howard N.

The new theatre was designed by the theatre architects [[Bertie Crewe]] and [[W. G. R. Sprague]].&lt;ref name=Lloyd&gt;[http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/AldershotTheatres/TheatreRoyalAldershot.htm The Theatre Royal on the Arthur Lloyd Music Hall and Theatre History Website]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The singer and comedian [[Arthur Lloyd (musician)|Arthur Lloyd]] appeared at the theatre in a tour of his play ''Ballyvogan'' in 1891. The theatre was extensively rebuilt and remodelled by Sounes and opened on 15 October 1900 as the New Theatre Royal with a production of ''[[The Private Secretary]]''.&lt;ref name=Lloyd/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cole, p151&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charlie Chaplin]], who had made his first stage appearance in Aldershot in 1894 returned to the town in May 1904 as a professional actor to play Billy the Page Boy in a tour of [[William Gillette]]'s play ''[[Sherlock Holmes (play)|Sherlock Holmes]]'', with [[Harry Arthur Saintsbury]] in the title role.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ovzYAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA226&amp;lpg=PA226&amp;dq=theatre+royal+aldershot&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wxu5MVmMSV&amp;sig=3sP5qiDK9w4Xkkqb4TmCOR7OpB8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi228--h_nPAhUhAZoKHYsPB6wQ6AEITDAI#v=onepage&amp;q=theatre%20royal%20aldershot&amp;f=false David Robinson, ''Chaplin: His Life And Art'', [[Penguin Books]] - [[Google Books]]]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The aviator [[Samuel Franklin Cody]] was in a box in the theatre in 1912 when, being observed by the audience he was invited to step to the front of the box to talk about the aeroplanes he was developing.&lt;ref&gt;Cole, p174&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8_mxBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA32&amp;lpg=PA32&amp;dq=theatre+royal+aldershot&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GcdYQCiDGv&amp;sig=RIM3H7qJJ6MIv9nIft0hSYfOWOo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjs3PX1o_nPAhVGdCwKHR_AB4s4FBDoAQg1MAY#v=onepage&amp;q=theatre%20royal%20aldershot&amp;f=false Murray Rowlands, ''Aldershot in the Great War: The Home of the British Army'', Pen &amp; Sword Military (2015) - [[Google Books]] - p32]&lt;/ref&gt; The English Opera Company appeared here in March 1914 in ''[[The Bohemian Girl]]'', ''[[Il trovatore|Il Trovatore]]'', ''[[Don Giovanni]]'' and ''[[Cavalleria rusticana|Cavalleria Rusticana]]'', among other works.&lt;ref&gt;Playbill for the English Opera Company - March 1914 at the Theatre Royal, Aldershot - Glenn Christodoulou Theatre Collection&lt;/ref&gt; In 1917 the [[curtain raiser]] ''Ida Collaborates'' by [[Noël Coward]] and [[Esmé Wynne-Tyson]] was performed at the theatre.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=4qJOBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA777&amp;lpg=PA777&amp;dq=theatre+royal+aldershot&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=X9K3cZKmhj&amp;sig=-EloayZrp_SQEWRfHXCeMYc06iM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjxtKHcn_nPAhWmCJoKHacjDng4ChDoAQgwMAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=theatre%20royal%20aldershot&amp;f=false [[Noël Coward]] (Ed.

This new theatre was very small on a small site and could only seat 881 in total, with 197 in the stalls, 220 in the pit, 84 in the Dress Circle, and 350 in the gallery at the rear of the dress circle with its own entrance from Gordon Road. There were two boxes which seated 30 in total on each side at Dress Circle level, with elaborate plasterwork on the dress circle and box fronts. The proscenium opening was 24 feet wide and 26 feet deep with the flies 32 feet high. In addition there were eight dressing rooms, a manager's office  and a band room with the stalls, pit and circle each having its own licensed bar.&lt;ref name=Lloyd/&gt;

From 1925 to 1926 the theatre was owned by local businessman W. A.

Aldershot being a Garrison Town, much of the audience at this time was male leading to a number of nude revues being held at the theatre. Other acts at this time included [[Todd Slaughter]] in the [[melodrama]] ''[[Jack the Ripper]]'', [[Billy Reid (British songwriter)|Billy Reid]] and his accordion band with [[Dorothy Squires]] as his vocalist, and [[Phyllis Dixey]] in her revue ''Peek A Boo''.&lt;ref name=Lloyd/&gt;

==Decline==
From 1946 to 1948 the Theatre Royal was home to Harry Hanson's Court Players. In the late 1940s, as her film career floundered, [[Jessie Matthews]] ran an amateur theatre group at the theatre. In 1948 Garcia leased the theatre to another management who formed the Aldershot Repertory Company who put on plays there including ''[[Pygmalion (play)|Pygmalion]]'' in 1950 starring Jessie Matthews until their final production, the [[pantomime]] ''[[Aladdin#Pantomimes|Aladdin]]'' in December 1952. Following this there was a short season of [[repertory theatre]] by the [[Arthur Brough|Arthur Brough Players]] but the theatre again went bankrupt and finally closed. A backstage fire in 1957 lead to great damage and the Theatre Royal was demolished in 1959.&lt;ref name=Lloyd/&gt;&lt;ref name=Vickers/&gt; A block of flats, Matinée House, occupies the site today.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7488">The '''Thomason Collection of Civil War Tracts''' consists of more than 22,000 pamphlets, broadsides, manuscripts, books, and news sheets, most of which were printed and distributed in [[London]] from 1640 to 1661. The collection represents a major [[primary source]] for the political, religious, military, and [[social history of England]] during the final years of the reign of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]], the [[English Civil War]], the [[Interregnum (England)|Interregnum]], and the [[English Restoration]] of [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]]. It is now held in the [[British Library]].

== Compilation of the collection ==
Bookseller and publisher [[George Thomason]] (died 1666), who maintained a shop in the churchyard of [[St. Paul's Cathedral]] in London, methodically collected and preserved the works over two decades. The tracts consist of a broad range of writings, including sermons, songs, political speeches, debates, opinions, jokes, gossip, news reports, descriptions of the trial and execution of Charles I, accounts of Civil War battles, reports from Parliament, and several regularly appearing publications that historians consider the forebears of modern newspapers. Thomason's collection represents approximately 80 percent of the published works released in England during this period.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=868}}{{sfn|Gillies|2013}}

Thomason frequently made handwritten annotations on the tracts, providing such information as publication dates and the authorship of anonymous works. During the turbulent years of the Civil War and [[the Protectorate]] of [[Oliver Cromwell]] Thomason reputedly moved the collection several times to protect the more controversial works from destruction by government or opposition censors.{{sfn|Gillies|2013}}

== History of the collection ==
Thomason appears to have entrusted the collection to the care of [[Thomas Barlow (bishop)|Thomas Barlow]], provost of [[The Queen's College, Oxford|The Queen's College]] and former librarian of the [[Bodleian Library]] at the [[University of Oxford]], and a future [[Bishop of Lincoln]]. Between 1660 and 1664 Barlow offered the tracts, together with two copies of a manuscript catalogue to the university for £4,000 but the sale was not agreed. Thomason remained hopeful that they would be sold, and in his will dated 1664, he charged his three executors (Barlow, Thomas Lockey, and [[John Rushworth]]) with selling the collection to the University on behalf of his children.

After Thomason's death in April 1666, the negotiations fell through and the collection remained in Barlow's hands, until they were acquired about 1677–1679 by the bookbinder [[Samuel Mearne]] on behalf of the Royal Library at the [[Palace of Whitehall]]. Mearne rebound the tract volumes in a uniform manner but was never paid for his work and so retained the collection. Eventually Mearne's widow sought and obtained the permission of the [[Privy Council]] in May 1684 to dispose of them on her family's behalf. Over the next four decades various members of the Sisson family (descendants of Samuel Mearne) endeavoured to sell the collection on numerous occasions to [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer]], the [[Bodleian Library]], [[Thomas Thynne, 1st Viscount Weymouth]], [[James Brydges, 1st Duke of Chandos]], [[Frederick, Prince of Wales]], the [[Radcliffe Library]] in Oxford and the antiquary and book collector [["Honest Tom" Martin]], but in each case the potential purchasers were put off by the high price asked.

In January 1754 Elizabeth Sisson approached [[Thomas Birch]] one of the trustees of the newly established [[British Museum]], loaning him the 12 volume catalogue, but again nothing was to come of the sale during Elizabeth Sisson's lifetime. Finally, in 1762, [[John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute]] purchased the collection on behalf of [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] for the bargain price of £300 (a fraction of the cost of forming the collection). In that same year [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] donated the collection to the new [[British Museum]] at [[Montagu House, Bloomsbury|Montagu House]], where they were originally known as the "King's pamphlets" and added to the Royal Library Collection. In 1973, the museum transferred the Thomason Tracts to the British Library where they continue to be housed.{{sfn|Gillies|2013}}

==Significance of the collection ==
According to [[Thomas Carlyle]], the Thomason Tracts were;
{{quote|
the most valuable set of documents connected with English history; greatly preferable to all the sheepskins in the Tower and other places, for informing the English what the English were in former times; I believe the whole secret of the seventeenth century is involved in that hideous mass of rubbish there (Report of the Commissioners appointed to inquire into the constitution and government of the British Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stoker|1992}} cites ''Report of the Commissioners appointed to inquire into the constitution and government of the British Museum'', (London, 1850), p. 274.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

== The Thomason Tracts today ==
Many of the publications that comprise the collection are exceedingly rare. In fact, some are not known to exist anywhere else. The tracts are bound into some 2,000 volumes and housed at the British Library's main building at [[St Pancras, London|St. Pancras]]. Because of their rarity and fragile condition, the originals are not available to general researchers. However, the library maintains paper facsimiles in its rare books collection, and in 1977 University Microfilms International released a set of 256 [[microfilm]] reels containing the entire collection. The microfilms are available at research libraries around the world.&lt;ref&gt;The Library of Congress, "[https://www.loc.gov/rr/microform/brit_govt.html British Government Documents in the Microform Reading Room]."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Virgilia bewailing the absence of Coriolanus, by Thomas Woolner.jpg|thumb|"Virgilia bewailing the absence of Coriolanus by [[Thomas Woolner]]]]
'''Virgilia''' is the wife of Coriolanus in [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Coriolanus (play)|Coriolanus]]'' (1607–1610), in which same play [[Volumnia (Shakespeare)|Volumnia]] is his mother.  With respect to the legendary figure [[Caius Marcius Coriolanus]], some accounts (Brewer, 1898) say that his wife's name was actually [[Volumnia (wife of Coriolanus)|''Volumnia'']], probably following the Roman historian [[Livy]].  However, in the very influential account of his life, and one familiar to Shakespeare, namely, [[Plutarch]]'s ''[[Lives of the Noble Greeks and Romans]]'', the wife's name is ''Virgilia'', or in [[John Dryden]]'s translation, ''Vergilia''. Virgilia is described by [[John Ruskin]] as "perhaps loveliest" of Shakespeare's female characters.

[[File:Suushi Yurei.jpg|thumb|''Yūrei'' by Sawaki Sūshi (1737)]]
'''''Yūrei-zu''''' (幽霊図) are a genre of Japanese art consisting of painted or woodblock print images of ghosts, demons and other supernatural beings. They are considered to be a subgenre of ''fūzokuga'', "pictures of manners and customs."&lt;ref name="Schaap 1998, 17"&gt;Schaap 1998, 17&lt;/ref&gt; These types of art works reached the peak of their popularity in Japan in the mid- to late 19th century.&lt;ref name="Addis"&gt;Addis 1985, 178&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Yūrei''==
Literally translatable as ‘faint (''yū'' - 幽) spirit (''rei'' - 霊),’ ''[[yūrei]]'' is just one of several Japanese words used to refer to spirit beings. Other terms include: ''[[obake]]'' (お化け), ''[[yōkai]]'' (妖怪), ''bōrei'' (亡霊), and ''[[shiryō]]'' (死霊). There is a long tradition of belief in the supernatural in Japan stemming from a variety of influences. Imported sources include [[Buddhism]], [[Taoism]] and [[List of supernatural beings in Chinese folklore|Chinese folklore]]. The most notable influence, however, is [[Shinto|Shintō]], a native Japanese [[animism|animistic religion]] which presupposes that our physical world is inhabited by eight million omnipresent spirits.&lt;ref name="Rubin"&gt;Rubin 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese ghosts are essentially spirits "on leave" from hell in order to complete an outstanding mission.&lt;ref name="Richie 1983, 7"&gt;Richie 1983, 7&lt;/ref&gt; The souls (''reikon'' - 霊魂) of those who die violently, do not receive proper funerary rites, or die while consumed by a desire for vengeance, do not pass peacefully to join the spirits of their ancestors in the afterlife. Instead, their ''reikon'' souls are transformed into ''ayurei'' souls, which can travel back to the physical world.&lt;ref&gt;Monstrous.com&lt;/ref&gt; According to Buddhist belief, the journey from the world of the living (''konoyo'' - この世) to that of the dead (''anoyo'' - あの世) takes 49 days, and it is in this limbo-like phase that they can attend to unresolved issues.&lt;ref&gt;Iwasaki and Toelken 1994, 15&lt;/ref&gt; There is a close relationship between the degree of an individual’s suffering in life and the severity of their actions in the afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan 1985, 27&lt;/ref&gt; While their intentions are not always evil, the results of their actions are almost always damaging for the humans involved.&lt;ref name="Richie 1983, 7"/&gt; Belief held that a ghost could only receive release through the prayers of a living individual that his/her soul be allowed to pass into the underworld.&lt;ref name="Rubin"/&gt;

==Historical background ==
[[File:Shimobe Fudesuke and the Ghost of the Woman in the Waterfall LACMA M.84.31.442.jpg|thumb|''Shimobe Fudesuke and the Ghost of the Woman in the Waterfall'' by Tsukioka Yoshitoshi (c. 1865)]]
Images of supernatural beings, as well as gory and grotesque scenes exist on Japanese painted scrolls going back to the medieval period. This tradition continued through the centuries, providing a foundation for ''yūrei-zu'', as well as for violent ''chimidoro-e'' (“bloody pictures” - 血みどろ絵) and ''muzan-e'' (“cruel pictures” - 無残絵) which were to become popular in [[Edo period|Edo Japan]].&lt;ref name="Fensom 2012"&gt;Fensom 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Although there are prior examples, ''yūrei-zu'' reached the pinnacle of their popularity in the mid- through late 19th century,&lt;ref name="Addis" /&gt; along with ghost themed ''[[kabuki]]'' plays and ghost tales (''[[kaidan]]'' - 怪談).&lt;ref name="Schaap 1998, 17"/&gt; Scholars link the "persistent popularity"&lt;ref&gt;Bell 2004, 140&lt;/ref&gt; of the occult to the "unsettled social conditions" prevailing during the late Edo,&lt;ref name="Addis" /&gt; which included the oppressive [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa]] regime, the beginnings of westernization, and a number of natural disasters.
&lt;ref&gt;See Addis 1985, 178; Rubin 2000; Harris 2010, 156; Schaap 1998, 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In addition to floods and earthquakes, Japan was blighted by a series of droughts which led to twenty periods of famine between 1675 and 1837 (Dolan and Worden 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Yūrei-zu'' and theatre==
[[File:Funazu - Yoshitoshi ryakuga - Walters 95350.jpg|thumb|''Yoshitoshi ryakuga'' by Tsukioka Yoshitoshi (1882)]]
Japan has long had a vibrant folkloric tradition of ghost stories, and in the early eighteenth century these began to be dramatized for the [[Noh|''nō'']] stage and ''[[bunraku]]'' puppet theatre.&lt;ref name="Rubin"/&gt; As ''kabuki'' began to flourish throughout the later 1700s, so too did the number of dramas based on ghost stories, particularly those involving vengeful female ghosts returning to punish their wrong-doers.&lt;ref name="Rubin"/&gt; ''Kabuki'', like ''[[ukiyo-e]]'', was a populist art form, which aimed to satisfy the dramatic tastes of a “proletarian clientele”: the rising working and middle classes in [[Edo]] (present-day Tokyo).&lt;ref&gt;Addis 1985, 179&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kabuki'' and ''ukiyo-e'' shared a close kinship, as woodblock artists attempted to tap into “the public’s ever-increasing appetite for tales of the bizarre and thrilling,” and share the ''kabuki'' audience demographic.&lt;ref name="Schaap 1998, 17"/&gt; As Sarah Fensom notes, "that prints of the macabre, the supernatural and the grotesque were so frequently designed and distributed is for the most part a greater reflection of 19th century Japanese tastes than of the agenda of the artists." &lt;ref&gt;2013&lt;/ref&gt; Artists produced images of ghosts as well as of actors in ghost roles, effecting a conflation of three prevailing trends in ''ukiyo-e'' of the period: depictions of the female form ([[Bijinga|''bijin-ga'']]), depictions of supernatural or macabre themes, and depictions of celebrated actors (''kabuki-e'' or ''shibai-e'').

==Censorship==
In an attempt to return Japan to its feudal, agrarian roots, the Tokugawa regime in 1842 instituted the [[Tenpō Reforms|Tempō Reforms]] (''Tempō no kaikaku'' - 天保の改革), a collection of laws governing many aspects of everyday life. In addition to the economy, the military, agriculture and religion, the Reforms reached into the world of art.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, ''Tempō Reforms''&lt;/ref&gt; The intent of the Reforms was essentially to valorize frugality and loyalty,&lt;ref name="The Fitzwilliam Museum"&gt;The Fitzwilliam Museum&lt;/ref&gt; thus ostentatious or morally dubious images such as depictions of ''geisha'', ''[[oiran]]'' courtesans and ''kabuki'' actors were banned.&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt; According to an 1842 decree aimed at print publishers: “To make woodblock prints of Kabuki actors, courtesans and geisha is detrimental to public morals. Henceforth the publication of new works [of this kind] as well as the sale of previously procured stocks is strictly forbidden. In future you are to select designs that are based on loyalty and filial piety and which serve to educate women and children, and you must insure that they are not luxurious.”&lt;ref name="The Fitzwilliam Museum"/&gt;

Given this climate of censorship, some artists used the ''yūrei-zu'' genre "to symbolically and humorously disguise … criticism of the social and political maladies of the day by having fantastic creatures appear as substitutes for real people, especially the ruling elite."&lt;ref name="Harris"&gt;Harris 2010, 156&lt;/ref&gt; Such critiques led the government to subsequently ban both ''yūrei-zu'' and ghost plays.&lt;ref name="Rubin" /&gt; The Tempō Reforms were ultimately unsuccessful,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; and the strict regulation of art works was no longer enforced after 1845, once the shogunal advisor who had initiated the Reforms left the government.&lt;ref&gt;Jesse 2012, 95&lt;/ref&gt; As long as the rules remained nominally in effect, some artists invoked clever word- and picture-play to circumvent censorship.&lt;ref name="The Fitzwilliam Museum"/&gt;

==''Yūrei-zu'' physical characteristics==
[[File:Hokusai Kohada Koheiji.jpg|thumb|''Kohada Koheiji'' by Hokusai (1831-1832)]]
The ghosts featured in Edo period ''ukiyo-e'' come in various forms. They can appear as animal creatures both real and imagined, such as foxes, cats, dragons and demons. They can also be the discontent spirits of male warriors.&lt;ref&gt;Fensom 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the ghosts featured, however, tend to be female, "specifically," as [[Donald Richie]] notes, "dissatisfied females."&lt;ref&gt;1983, 6&lt;/ref&gt;

The subjects in ''yūrei-zu'' typically correspond to a very specific set of physical characteristics:&lt;ref&gt;Jordan 1985, 25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davisson 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
* long, straight black hair, which is often unkempt
* white or pale-coloured kimono akin to the plain white ''katabira'' (帷子) or ''kyōkatabira'' (経帷子) funerary kimono
* long, flowing sleeves
* some are depicted with a triangular ''[[hitaikakushi]]'' (額隠) forehead cloth also associated with [[Japanese funeral|Japanese funerary tradition]]
* a thin, fragile frame
* outstretched arms, sometimes waving or beckoning
* hands hanging limply from the wrists
* no body below the waist
* often accompanied by ''[[hitodama]]'' (人魂), green, blue or purple floating flames
* transparent or semi-transparent

By nature, they:&lt;ref&gt;Richie 1983, 6&lt;/ref&gt;
* are nocturnal
* avoid running water
* appear in true ghostly guise when reflected in a mirror or water surface

==Notable Edo examples==
[[File:Oyuki.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|''Ghost of Oyuki'' by Maruyama Ōkyo (1750–1780)]]

===''The Ghost of Oyuki''===
The earliest ''yūrei-zu'' is considered to be by [[Maruyama Ōkyo]] (円山 応挙), founder of the Maruyama school and one of the most significant artists of the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, ''Maruyama Ōkyo''&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Ghost of Oyuki]]'' (''Oyuki no maboroshi'' - お雪の幻) is a silk scroll painting dating to the second half of the 18th century &lt;ref&gt;Jordan suggests the painting was produced when Maruyama was “in his mid-forties” (1985, 33n), which would make it c. 1778; however, Stevenson states that it was completed for the shogun in or around 1760 (1983, 10), and yet another source believes it to date from 1750 (Chin Music Press).&lt;/ref&gt; In Maruyama’s naturalistic style,&lt;ref&gt;Apocryphally, Maruyama once painted such a realistic ghost image that it came to life and terrified him. The incident is immortalized in a painting by [[Taiso Yoshitoshi]] (1839-1892) entitled 'Yoshitoshi Ryakuga'. (Art History Reference)&lt;/ref&gt; it depicts a faintly coloured female ghost whose body tapers into transparency. It has been described as an “image of haunting beauty.”&lt;ref name="Jordan_a"&gt;Jordan 1985, 26&lt;/ref&gt; According to a scroll box inscription by a one-time owner, the subject of the painting is Maruyama’s lover,&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson suggests that in the absence of the subject, Maruyama’s dying aunt acted as his model (1983, 10)&lt;/ref&gt; a ''[[geisha]]'' who died young.&lt;ref name="Jordan_a"/&gt; Her ghost is said to have visited the artist in a dream and inspired him to paint her portrait.&lt;ref name="Jordan_a"/&gt;

===Other Edo artists===
All of the pre-eminent ''ukiyo-e'' artists of the later Edo period produced ''yūrei-zu'', including [[Kunisada]], [[Hokusai]] &lt;ref&gt;See the 1831 series ''One Hundred [Ghost] Tales'' (''Hyaku monogatari'')&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Utagawa Kuniyoshi]], who “designed the largest number of prints portraying ghosts as well as other strange, unusual and fantastic creatures.” &lt;ref name="Harris" /&gt;

Another major producer of ''yūrei-zu'' was [[Yoshitoshi|Tsukioka Yoshitoshi]] who reputedly had personal encounters with ghosts in 1865 and 1880. In 1865 he produced the series ''One Hundred Ghost Stories of China and Japan'' (''Wakan hyaku monogatari''), his first series to feature ghosts. The original series, which was based on a popular game of the period involving ghost stories, included one hundred images; however, only twenty-six were published.&lt;ref&gt;Chiappa, J. Noel and Levine, Jason M. 2009&lt;/ref&gt; His final print series, ''New Forms of 36 Ghosts'' (''Shinkei sanjūrokuten''), was "so freakishly popular," according to Sarah Fensom, "that the blocks from which it was printed wore out."&lt;ref name="Fensom 2012"/&gt;

==Contemporary examples==
[[File:Female Ghost.JPG|thumb|upright|''Female Ghost'' by Kunisada (1852)]]
Although patently no longer as pervasive as during the late Edo period, ''yūrei-zu'' and contemporary variations continue to be produced by Japanese artists in various media. One prominent example is the ''[[nihonga]]'' painter [[Fuyuko Matsui]] (b. 1974), whose ghostly images are described as “beautiful and eerie,”&lt;ref&gt;Japan Echo&lt;/ref&gt; “dark [and] Gothic,” and “disturbing and mesmerizing.”&lt;ref name="Liddell"&gt;Liddell&lt;/ref&gt; Matsui has identified a goal of her works as imparting “a condition that maintains sanity while being close to madness.”&lt;ref name="Liddell"/&gt; Matsui’s colour on silk hanging scroll “Nyctalopia” (2005) is particularly reminiscent of classic ''yūrei-zu'' such as Maruyama’s “The Ghost of Oyuki.”&lt;ref&gt;See image at http://www.matsuifuyuko.com/works-e/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Another artist whose works echo ''yūrei-zu'' is [[Hisashi Tenmyouya]] (b. 1966). Between 2004 and 2005, Tenmyouya completed a series of acrylic on wood paintings entitled ''New Version of Six Ghost Stories'' (新形六怪撰).  The six images are reworkings of famous Japanese ghost stories, such as [[Yotsuya Kaidan|''Tokaido Yotsuya'']] ''Ghost Story'' and ''Kohata Koheiji Ghost Story'', which were rendered in woodblocks by Edo artists.&lt;ref&gt;See images at http://www3.ocn.ne.jp/~tenmyoya/paintings/0_paintings.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Also creating contemporary ''yūrei-zu'' in a traditional style is American-born, Japanese-resident artist Matthew Meyer. His ''Japanese Yōkai'' series is collected in his illustrated book ''The Night Parade of One Hundred Demons''. According to Meyer, the intention of his paintings is "to recreate the feeling of old Japanese woodblock prints while adding a contemporary illustrative touch."&lt;ref&gt;http://matthewmeyer.net/&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of ''yūrei-zu'' is also evident in the [[manga]] of [[Shigeru Mizuki]] (b. 1922) and [[Hiroshi Shiibashi]] (b. 1980), both of whom are renowned for their works dealing with traditional Japanese aspects of the supernatural.
