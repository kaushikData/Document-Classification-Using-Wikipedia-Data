'''Abu 'Ali Ahmad Chaghani''' ({{lang-fa|ابوعلی احمد چغانی}}) (died 955) was the [[Muhtajids|Muhtajid]] ruler of [[Chaghaniyan]] (939&amp;ndash;955) and governor of [[Samanid]] [[Greater Khorasan|Khurasan]] (939&amp;ndash;945, 952&amp;ndash;953). He was the son of [[Abu Bakr Muhammad]].

== Biography ==
In 939, Muhammad became ill and Abu 'Ali was assigned to succeed him in his posts. As governor of Khurasan he undertook several campaigns in northern [[Iran]], conquering [[Gurgan]] and territory as far west as [[Ray, Iran|Ray]] from the [[Ziyarids]], forcing the Ziyarids to acknowledge Samanid authority, and killing the [[Dailamite]] adventurer [[Makan ibn Kaki]]. After he departed for Khurasan the [[Buyid]] [[Rukn al-Dawla]] seized Ray. In 945 Abu 'Ali returned and expelled the Buyids from Ray, but they returned a year later.
[[File:Iran circa 1000AD.png|thumb|right|250px|Persia in the mid-10th century]]
That same year, 945, the Samanid amir [[Nuh I]] dismissed Abu 'Ali from the governorship of Khurasan after hearing complaints of the latter's harsh rule,{{sfn|Frye|1975|pp=149-151}}{{sfn|Bosworth|1984|pp=764–766}} and sought to replace him with a Turk, the [[Simjurids|Simjurid]] [[Ibrahim ibn Simjur]]. Abu 'Ali refused to accept his dismissal and rebelled. He was joined by several prominent Iranian figures such as [[Abu Mansur Muhammad]], whom he appointed as the commander of Khurasan. Abu 'Ali also convinced a Samanid, Nuh's uncle [[Ibrahim ibn Ahmad]], to come from [[Iraq]] and installed him as amir in [[Bukhara]] when he took the city in 947. Abu 'Ali, now having secured his position, returned to Chaghaniyan. Ibrahim, however, was unpopular with the people of Bukhara, and Nuh soon retaliated by retaking the city and blinding Ibrahim and two brothers.

When the news of the re-capture of Bukhara arrived to Abu 'Ali, he once again marched towards Bukhara, but was defeated by an army sent by Nuh and withdrew back to Chaghaniyan. After some time, he left the region and tried to obtain support from other Samanid vassals. Meanwhile, Nuh had Chaghaniyan ravaged{{sfn|Bosworth|2011|p=63}} and its capital sacked.{{sfn|Frye|1975|pp=149-151}} Another battle shortly ensured between Abu 'Ali and a Samanid army in [[Tukharistan]], which resulted in a Samanid victory. Fortunately for Abu 'Ali, he managed to secure the support of other Samanid vassals, such as the rulers of [[Khuttal]], and the Kumiji mountain people, and in the end made peace with Nuh, who allowed him to keep Chaghaniyan in return for sending his son [[Abu'l Muzaffar Abdallah]] as hostage to Bukhara.{{sfn|Bosworth|2011|p=63}}{{sfn|Bosworth|1984|pp=764–766}}

Some time later, Abu 'Ali was sent on an expedition to quell a rebellion near Chaghaniyan under a self-proclaimed prophet known as Mahdi.{{sfn|Bosworth|2011|p=64}} Abu 'Ali managed to successfully defeat and capture the latter and then had his head sent to Bukhara. In ca. 951/2, Abu 'Ali's son Abu'l Muzaffar Abdallah died in an accident{{sfn|Bosworth|1984|pp=764–766}} and his corpse was shortly sent to Chaghaniyan, where he was buried.{{sfn|Bosworth|2011|p=64}}

In 952 following the death of the governor of Khurasan, [[Mansur ibn Qara-Tegin]] (Ibrahim ibn Simjur had already died in 948), 'Abu Ali was reinstated by Nuh as governor of the province.{{sfn|Frye|1975|pp=149-151}} At the insistence of the Ziyarids he began a war with the Buyid Rukn al-Dawla, but was unable to take Ray and made peace. This action upset Nuh, who again removed him from the governorship. 'Abu Ali fled to the Buyids and received an investiture diploma for Khurasan from the [[Caliph]] and was even reinforced by an army under [[Lashkarwarz]], but was unable to enforce his claim or even return to Chaghaniyan. 

In 955 he and one of his sons died of the plague in Ray. Their bodies were shortly brought to Chaghanian where they were buried. A certain Muhtajid prince, [[Abu'l Muzaffar ibn Muhammad]], probably the grandson of 'Abu Ali, was then appointed as the new ruler of Chaghaniyan. However, according to some other sources, Abu 'Ali was succeeded by his relative [[Abu'l-Hasan Taher]].{{sfn|Bosworth|1984|pp=764–766}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10647">The '''[[Martti Ahtisaari|Ahtisaari]] Plan''', formally the '''Comprehensive Proposal for the Kosovo Status Settlement''' ('''CSP'''), is a status settlement proposal covering a wide range of issues related to the [[Kosovo status process]] for [[Kosovo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Letter dated 26 March 2007 from the Secretary-General addressed to the President of the Security Council |publisher=[[United Nations Security Council]] |date=26 March 2007 |at=Annex |url=http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/rwb.nsf/retrieveattachments?openagent&amp;shortid=YZHG-6ZNTVS&amp;file=Full_Report.pdf |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20071214235411/http%3A//www.reliefweb.int/rw/RWFiles2007.nsf/FilesByRWDocUnidFilename/YZHG%2D6ZNTVS%2Dfull_report.pdf/%24File/full_report.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=14 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the main components of the plan include the formation of the [[International Steering Group for Kosovo]] (ISG), and the [[International Civilian Representative for Kosovo]] (ICR), the [[European Union Special Representative]] (EUSR) for Kosovo, appointed by the [[Council of the European Union]].&lt;ref name="plan-art4.1"&gt;{{citation|title=Letter dated 26 March 2007 from the Secretary-General addressed to the President of the Security Council, Addendum, Comprehensive Proposal for the Kosovo Status Settlement, Annex IX, International Civilian Representative |publisher=[[United Nations Security Council]] |date=26 March 2007 |at=article 4.1 |url=http://www.unosek.org/docref/Comprehensive_proposal-english.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091009130102/http://www.unosek.org/docref/Comprehensive_proposal-english.pdf |archivedate=9 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="plan-art12.1"&gt;{{citation|title=Letter dated 26 March 2007 from the Secretary-General addressed to the President of the Security Council, Addendum, Comprehensive Proposal for the Kosovo Status Settlement |publisher=[[United Nations Security Council]] |date=26 March 2007 |at=article 12.1 |url=http://www.unosek.org/docref/Comprehensive_proposal-english.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091009130102/http://www.unosek.org/docref/Comprehensive_proposal-english.pdf |archivedate=9 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2012 President [[Boris Tadić]] recommended his Five-Point Plan for Kosovo, essentially an upgrade of the Ahtisaari Plan. 

On 10 September 2012, the International Steering Group had its final meeting&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ico-kos.org/f/pdf/COMMUNIQUE16thISG-Eng.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022143615/http://www.ico-kos.org/f/pdf/COMMUNIQUE16thISG-Eng.pdf |archivedate=2013-10-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ico-kos.org/?id=61|title=Ending of supervised independence 10 September 2012|publisher=International Civilian Office|accessdate=6 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and formally ended its supervision,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.ria.ru/world/20120910/175884680.html|title=International Steering Group Ends Kosovo Supervision|author=Sputnik|date=10 September 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The proposal included provisions covering:

* Constitutional provisions
* Rights of Communities and their Members
* Decentralization of local government
* Justice system
* Religious and cultural heritage
* International debt
* Property and archives
* Kosovo security sector
* [[International Civilian Representative]]
* [[European Security and Defense Policy]] (ESDP) [[EU mission in Kosovo|Rule of Law mission]]
* International Military Presence (such as continuation of KFOR)

[[Martti Ahtisaari]] stated, on 8 February 2007, that after a period of consultations with the parties, he would finalize his Settlement proposal for submission to the UN Security Council, when he would also elaborate on the status issue itself.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://web.archive.org/web/20070926213916/http://www.unosek.org/pressrelease/2007-02-08-Press_Conference_by_SE_Martti_Ahtisaari,_in_NY_.doc Ahtisaari press conference] ", ''UNOSEK website'' , New York, 8 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Belgrade, [[Prime Minister of Serbia|Serbian Prime Minister]] [[Vojislav Koštunica]] refused to receive Ahtisaari.  Koštunica claimed that because Serbia had still not formed a new government after the January 21 parliamentary elections he had no mandate to discuss Kosovo and therefore could not meet Ahtisaari.  Nevertheless, he later denounced the proposal as "illegitimate and unacceptable" because he alleged it "violates the U.N. Charter  ... by undermining sovereignty of U.N. member Serbia."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://voanews.com/english/2007-02-02-voa51.cfm UN Envoy Presents Kosovo Plan, Serbia Quickly Rejects It] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070204060433/http://www.voanews.com/english/2007-02-02-voa51.cfm |date=2007-02-04 }} ", by Barry Wood, ''[[Voice of America]]'' (VOA), Washington, 2 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.srbija.gov.rs/vesti/vest.php?id=31550 "Ahtisaari's proposal unacceptable and illegitimate for Serbia"], Government of the Republic of Serbia website, Belgrade, 7 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Boris Tadić]] did receive Ahtisaari, after which he reaffirmed his vow to never accept an independent Kosovo.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/un_kosovo;_ylt=Ao.rrNE3_hxI1gVTsCEJYhkXxHcA;_ylu=X3oDMTBiMW04NW9mBHNlYwMlJVRPUCUl U.N. envoy unveils Kosovo proposal] ", by Garentina Kraja, ''[[Associated Press]]'' (AP), Pristina, 2 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Foreign Minister [[Vuk Drašković]] warned that it was "necessary to avoid an imposed solution that could cause Serbia to become a factor of instability."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/02/07/europe/EU-GEN-Serbia-EU.php "Serbian leaders warn UN plan for Kosovo could destabilize Balkans"], ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'', Belgrade, 7 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Pristina, Kosovo Albanian leaders issued a statement after meeting with Ahtisaari saying they are "convinced that the international process for the resolution of Kosovo's status led by President Ahtisaari will be concluded soon with Kosovo becoming an independent state."&lt;ref&gt;"Unity Team Press Statement," 2 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States called the proposal "fair and balanced,"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2007/february/79774.htm Presentation of Kosovo Status Proposal to the Parties] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171006013500/https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2007/february/79774.htm |date=2017-10-06 }}, Sean McCormack, U.S. Department of State spokesman, Washington, DC, 2 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; while the EU Presidency noted that Ahtisaari's proposals "build on almost twelve months of direct talks between Belgrade and Pristina."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eu2007.de/en/News/CFSP_Statements/February/0202Kosovo.html EU Presidency Statement on the Kosovo status proposals to be presented today by Martti Ahtisaari in Belgrade and Pristina] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208061300/http://www.eu2007.de/en/News/CFSP_Statements/February/0202Kosovo.html |date=2007-02-08 }}, 2 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 February, Ahtisaari began a period of consultations with the parties in Vienna to finalize the Settlement.  He made clear that his proposal was a draft and that he would incorporate compromise solutions into the final document.  After this period of consultations and further modification of the Settlement, Ahtisaari convened a high-level meeting of the parties in Vienna on March 10.  After this meeting, leaders from both sides signaled a total unwillingness to compromise on their central demands (Kosovo Albanians for Kosovo's independence; Serbia for continued sovereignty over Kosovo).  Concluding that there was no chance for the two sides to reconcile their positions, Ahtisaari said he intended to submit to the UN Security Council his proposed status recommendations, including an explicit recommendation for the status outcome itself, by the end of March.

In November 2008, the EU accepted the demand of Serbia not to implement the plan of Ahtisaari through EULEX.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=BalkanInsight.com |url=http://www.sofiaecho.com/article/eu-accepts-belgrade-s-conditions-for-eulex/id_32852/catid_68 |title=EU accepts Belgrade’s conditions for EULEX |publisher=Sofiaecho.com |date=2008-11-07 |accessdate=2010-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of Algeria}}

The '''2002 Algerian Legislative election''' was held in [[Algeria]] on 30 May 2002 to elect members of the [[People's National Assembly]]. The governing [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|National Liberation Front]] (FLN) won a majority of seats in the election. The election suffered from a low turnout, violence and boycotts by some opposition parties.

==Candidates==
The election saw 10,052 candidates standing in the election from 23 [[List of political parties in Algeria|political parties]]. Of the candidates, 694 were female and 1,266 were independents.&lt;ref name=guide&gt;{{cite web| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/monitoring/media_reports/2013000.stm | title = Guide to Algeria elections | accessdate = 2008-08-01 | date = 2002-05-28 | publisher = ''[[BBC Online]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campaign==
[[President of Algeria|President]] [[Abdelaziz Bouteflika]] announced the date of the election on 20 February and the official campaign began on 9 May.&lt;ref name=diminishing&gt;{{cite web| url = http://aceproject.org/ero-en/regions/africa/DZ/Algeria%20-%20A400686_24062002.pdf/view | title = Algeria - Diminishing Returns: Algeria’s 2002 Legislative Elections(ICG Report)  | accessdate = 2008-08-01 | date = 2002-05-28 | publisher = ''ACE Electoral Knowledge Network''}}&lt;/ref&gt; The President vowed that they would be free elections and warned people against undermining them.&lt;ref name=care&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,54028,00.html | title = Algeria Holds Elections, and Few Care | accessdate = 2008-08-02 | date = 2002-05-30 | publisher = ''[[Fox News Channel]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; However five opposition parties boycotted the election, the [[Socialist Forces Front]] (FFS), [[Rally for Culture and Democracy]] (RCD), [[Republican National Alliance]] (ANR), [[Movement of Democrats and Socialists]] (MDS) and the [[Socialist Workers' Party (Algeria)|Socialist Workers' Party]] (PST).&lt;ref name=guide/&gt; They claimed that previous elections in 1997 and 1999 were fraudulent and that this election would be no different.&lt;ref name=wins&gt;{{cite news| url = http://archives.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/africa/05/31/algeria.elections/index.html | title = Ruling party wins Algeria election | accessdate = 2008-08-01 | date = 2002-05-31 | publisher = ''[[CNN]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A survey carried out by Al-Watan newspaper showed that 70% would vote for one of the 3 parties in the ruling coalition, the FLN, [[National Rally for Democracy (Algeria)|National Rally for Democracy]] and the [[Movement of Society for Peace]].&lt;ref name=berbers&gt;{{cite web | url = http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2002/588/re8.htm | title = Berbers boycott polls | accessdate = 2008-08-02 | date = 2002-05-30 | publisher = ''[[Al-Ahram]]'' | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081011073718/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2002/588/re8.htm | archive-date = 2008-10-11 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The FLN of [[Prime Minister of Algeria|Prime Minister]] [[Ali Benflis]] campaigned on a platform of unifying the different social groups of Algeria such as by [[regional development]] in the south. The RND, which had won the most seats at the [[Algerian legislative election, 1997|last election in 1997]], campaigned for [[Economic liberalism|economic liberalisation]] but was undermined by the lack of a base of support or a social ideology.&lt;ref name=diminishing/&gt; The leader of the RND, [[Ahmed Ouyahia]], warned of the dangers of an [[Islamism|Islamist]] victory but his concerns were dismissed by the [[interior minister]].&lt;ref name=guide/&gt; The opposition [[Workers' Party (Algeria)|Workers' Party]] led by [[Louisa Hanoune]] campaigned against outside interference in Algeria and against [[privatisation]].&lt;ref name=diminishing/&gt;

The campaign saw widespread apathy with many people seeing the parliament as toothless and the military as remaining the main power.&lt;ref name=ruling&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.sptimes.ru/index.php?action_id=2&amp;story_id=7302 | title = Ruling NLF Makes Gains in Algerian Poll | accessdate = 2008-08-01 | date = 2002-06-04 | publisher = ''[[The St. Petersburg Times]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FLN attempted to raise interest in the election by doing things such as creating a rap song for younger people.&lt;ref name=diminishing/&gt; However the poll by El Watan showed that over a third planned not to vote and in areas such as [[Bab el-Oued]] election billboards were mostly empty.&lt;ref name=care/&gt;&lt;ref name=roil&gt;{{cite web| url = http://allafrica.com/stories/200205300727.html | title = Algeria: Boycott, Violence Roil Algerian Elections | accessdate = 2008-08-02 | date = 2002-05-30 | publisher = ''[[AllAfrica.com]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; High unemployment, water and housing shortages were also seen as contributing to the apathy in the election.&lt;ref name=wins/&gt;

===Election day===
On the day before the election 23 people were killed in [[Sendjas]] by the [[Armed Islamic Group]] (GIA) in continued violence from the [[Algerian Civil War]].&lt;ref name=dissent&gt;{{cite news| url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/may/31/gilestremlett | title = Death and dissent as Algeria goes to polls | accessdate = 2008-08-02 | date = 2002-05-31 | publisher = ''[[guardian.co.uk]]'' | location=London | first=Giles | last=Tremlett}}&lt;/ref&gt; On polling day itself security forces were out in force in [[Algiers]] with many [[roadblock]]s to prevent terrorist attacks.&lt;ref name=wins/&gt;

In the north eastern [[Kabylie]] region a [[general strike]] was organised and running battles took place in the regional capital [[Tizi Ouzou]] to try to prevent the election from taking place in the region.

==Results==

The '''Bayfield Applefest''' is a fall [[harvest festival]] held in October, in [[Bayfield, Wisconsin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bayfield.org|url=https://www.bayfield.org/festivals-events/bayfield-apple-festival/|accessdate=27 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in 1962, it has become a destination for many people from across the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], with an annual attendance of approximately 60,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Duluth News Tribune|url=http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/lifestyle/3582660-apple-time-theres-lots-slices-bayfields-annual-event|accessdate=27 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The festival is a celebration of Bayfield's local heritage, especially showcasing products from the many local [[Orchard|apple orchards]] and [[Winery|wineries]]. The festival offers a variety of events and attractions. The street festival features over 60 booths, offering fresh foods and local crafts. Other attractions include tours of the 14 local orchards, live music, and an [[amusement park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Duluth News Tribune|url=http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/lifestyle/3582660-apple-time-theres-lots-slices-bayfields-annual-event|accessdate=27 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the early 1960s, Jim Erickson, the owner of an orchard in Bayfield, was traveling to North Dakota to deliver a shipment of apples. While in [[Duluth, Minnesota|Duluth]], his truck had a flat tire. While waiting for a spare to be driven up from home, many people stopped to ask about buying his fruit. After selling bushels of apples to 25 people, he started wondering why he (and other Bayfield apple growers) were traveling so far to sell their goods. Realizing an opportunity, a discussion was raised about selling the local orchard's products more locally, and the idea of Applefest was born. The attendance of the first event in 1962 was 5,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Duluth News Tribune|url=http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/lifestyle/3582660-apple-time-theres-lots-slices-bayfields-annual-event|accessdate=27 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over they years, Applefest has continued to experience huge growth in attendance.

The '''April 9 tragedy''' (also known as '''Tbilisi massacre''' or '''Tbilisi tragedy''') refers to the events in [[Tbilisi]], [[Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic]], on April 9, 1989, when an [[anti-Soviet]] (but pro-Stalin) demonstration was dispersed by the [[Soviet Army]], resulting in 21 deaths and hundreds of injuries. April 9 is now remembered as the '''Day of National Unity''' ({{lang-ka|ეროვნული ერთიანობის დღე}} ''erovnuli ertianobis dghe''), an annual [[Public holidays in Georgia|public holiday]].

==Prelude==
The anti-Soviet movement became more active in the Georgian SSR in 1988. Several strikes and meetings were organized by anti-Soviet political organizations in Tbilisi. The conflict between the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] government and Georgian nationalists deepened after the so-called Lykhny Assembly on March 18, 1989, when several thousand [[Abkhaz people|Abkhaz]] demanded secession from Georgia and restoration of the Union republic status of 1921&amp;ndash;1931. In response, the anti-Soviet groups organized a series of unsanctioned meetings across the republic, claiming that the Soviet government was using Abkhaz separatism in order to oppose the pro-independence movement.

The protests reached their peak on April 4, 1989, when tens of thousands of [[Georgian people|Georgians]] gathered before the House of Government on [[Rustaveli Avenue]] in Tbilisi. The protesters, led by the Independence Committee ([[Merab Kostava]], [[Zviad Gamsakhurdia]], [[Giorgi Chanturia]], Irakli Bathiashvili, Irakli Tsereteli and others) organized a peaceful demonstration and hunger strikes, demanding the punishment of Abkhaz secessionists and restoration of Georgian independence.&lt;ref name="Sobchak"&gt;[http://sobchak.org/rus/docs/zakluchenie.htm Report of the Sobchak's commission of inquiry (in Russian)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Local [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] authorities lost control over the situation in the capital and were unable to contain the protests. First Secretary of the Georgian Communist Party [[Jumber Patiashvili]] asked USSR leadership to send troops to restore order and impose curfew.&lt;ref name="Sobchak"/&gt;

==The demonstrations==
In the evening of April 8, 1989, [[Colonel General]] [[Igor Rodionov]], Commander of the [[Transcaucasus Military District]], ordered his troops to mobilize. Moments before the attack by the Soviet forces, the Patriarch of Georgia [[Ilia II]] addressed the demonstrators asking them to leave [[Rustavelis Gamziri|Rustaveli Avenue]] and the vicinity of the government building due to the danger which accumulated during the day after appearance of Soviet tanks near the avenue. The demonstrators refused to disband even after the Patriarch's plea. The local Georgian [[militsiya]] (police) units were disarmed just before the operation.&lt;ref name=Sobchak /&gt;

On April 9, at 3:45 a.m., Soviet [[Armoured personnel carrier|APCs]] and troops under General [[Igor Rodionov]] surrounded the demonstration area.&lt;ref name=Sobchak /&gt; Later, Rodionov claimed in his interview that groups of Georgian militants attacked unarmed soldiers with stones, metal chains and rods.&lt;ref name ="Rodionov" &gt;[http://www.warlib.ru/index.php?id=000064 Interview with Igor Rodionov]&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet troops received an order from General Rodionov to disband and clear the avenue of demonstrators by any means necessary.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;New Nations Rising: The Fall of the Soviets and the Challenge of Independence, Nadia Diuk, Adrian Karatnycky&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Clash ===
The Soviet detachment, armed with military batons and [[Entrenching tool|spades]] (a favorite weapon of [[spetsnaz|Soviet special forces]] &lt;ref&gt;[[Viktor Suvorov]] ''[http://militera.lib.ru/research/suvorov6/index.html Spetsnaz]'', 1987, Hamish Hamilton Ltd, {{ISBN|0-241-11961-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;), advanced on demonstrators moving along the [[Rustaveli Avenue]].&lt;ref name=Sobchak /&gt; During the advance, the soldiers started to attack demonstrators with spades, inflicting injuries both minor and serious to anyone who was struck.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

One of the victims of the attack was a 16-year-old girl who tried to get away from the advancing soldiers, but was chased down and beaten to death near the steps of the government building, receiving blows to the head and chest. She was dragged out of the area by her mother who was also attacked and wounded. This particularly violent attack was recorded on video from the balcony of a building located on the other side of the avenue. The video was used in the aftermath as evidence during [[Anatoly Sobchak|Sobchak's]] ''Parliamentary commission on investigation of events of April 9, 1989''. Groups of Soviet soldiers were reported to chase individual victims, rather than dispersing the crowd.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=LToXsIwZ_P8|title=Documentary Film - The April 9, 1989 Tragedy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[stampede]] following the attack resulted in the death of 19 people, among them 17 women. [[Autopsies]] conducted on the victims concluded the direct cause of death of all those who died, with 
the exception of one case of serious skull and brain injury, was suffocation (asphyxia) caused by both the compression of the body and the inhalation of chemical substances.&lt;ref name="Sobchak" /&gt;

Official Soviet reports blamed the demonstrators for causing the clash, saying that the troops were attacked with sticks and knives.&lt;ref name="lib.unb.ca"&gt;http://www.lib.unb.ca/Texts/JCS/bin/get4.cgi?directory=spring99/&amp;filename=cotter_notes.htm&lt;/ref&gt; According to Tass, the soldiers followed orders not to use their weapons, but that extremists attacked them with pieces of metal, bricks and sticks. Tass described the demonstrators as stirring interethnic strife and calling for the overthrow of the Georgian government. President Gorbachev slammed "actions by irresponsible persons" for loss of life. He said that the disturbances sought to overthrow the Georgian government and stir ethnic tension in Georgia. Foreign ministry spokesman said that the clashes were sparked by "die-hard nationalists, extremists and political adventurists who are abusing democratization to the detriment of our new policy of openness and of our very society." &lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, Toronto Star, Apr 13, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1989-04-11/news/mn-1600_1_calm-soviet-georgia-nationalist-armenia-and-azerbaijan Los Angeles Times, April 11, 1989]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[CN gas|CN]] and [[CS gas]] were used against the demonstrators;&lt;ref name="Sobchak" /&gt; vomiting, respiratory problems and sudden paralyses of the [[nervous system]] were reported.&lt;ref name="State 1998 pp. 26-27"&gt;Nationalist Violence and the State: Political Authority and Contentious Repertoires in the Former USSR, Mark R. Beissinger Comparative Politics, Vol. 30, No. 4 (Jul., 1998), pp. 26-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

The unarmed police officers attempted to evacuate the panicked group of demonstrators, however a video taken secretly by opposition journalists showed that soldiers did not allow doctors and emergency workers to help the injured people; even ambulances were attacked by the advancing soldiers&lt;ref&gt;Defending the Border: Identity, Religion, And Modernity in the Republic of Georgia (Culture and Society After Socialism)

On April 10, the Soviet government issued a statement blaming the demonstrators for causing unrest and danger to the safety of the public. The next day, Georgian TV showed the bodies of the 19 women violently killed, demonstrating alleged brutality by the Soviet soldiers, as the faces of the deceased women were hard to identify due to the facial injuries and blows to the head. The Soviet government blamed the demonstrators for the death of the 20 people, claiming that they had trampled each other while panicking and retreating from the advancing Soviet soldiers.&lt;ref name="Georgia p 18" /&gt; Ironically there was some truth in this, as Soviet troops had blocked all exists from the area except for one narrow passage, which made flight from the area difficult and induced the crush of the crowd and, possibly, some desperate defensive violence by the trapped demonstrators.&lt;ref&gt;Lehrke, Jesse Paul. The Transition to National Armies in the Former Soviet Republics, 1988-2005.” Oxfordshire, UK: Routledge (2013), Chapter 2. (See: http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9780415688369/) &lt;/ref&gt;

A Parliamentary commission on investigation of events of April 9, 1989 in Tbilisi was launched by [[Anatoly Sobchak]], member of [[Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union|Congress of People's Deputies]] of [[Soviet Union]]. After full investigation and inquiries, the commission confirmed the government's claim that the deaths had resulted from trampling, but another contributing factor had been the chemical substances used against the demonstrators. It condemned the military, which had caused the deaths by trying to disperse demonstrators. The commission's report made it more difficult to use military power against demonstrations of civil unrest in the Soviet Union. Sobchak's report presented a detailed account of the violence which was used against the demonstrators and recommended the full prosecution of military personnel responsible for the April 9 event.&lt;ref name="State 1998 pp. 26-27" /&gt;

==Aftermath==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2011}}
[[File:April9victims.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Photos of the April 9, 1989 Massacre victims (mostly young women) on a billboard in Tbilisi.]]
On April 10, in protest against the crackdown, Tbilisi and the rest of Georgia went out on strike and a 40-day period of mourning was declared. People brought massive collections of flowers to the place of the killings. A state of emergency was declared, but demonstrations continued.

The government of the Georgian SSR resigned as a result of the event. [[Moscow]] claimed the demonstrators attacked first and the soldiers had to repel them.  At the first [[Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union|Congress of People's Deputies]] (May&amp;ndash;June 1989) [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] disclaimed all responsibility, shifting blame onto the army. The revelations in the liberal Soviet media, as well as the findings of the "pro-[[Perestroika]]" Deputy [[Anatoly Sobchak]]'s commission of enquiry into the Tbilisi events, reported at the second Congress in December 1989, resulted in embarrassment for the Soviet hardliners and army leadership implicated in the event.

==Legacy==

The April 9 tragedy radicalised Georgian opposition to Soviet power. A few months later, a session of the Supreme Council of Georgian SSR, held on November 17–18, 1989, officially condemned the occupation{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} and annexation of [[Democratic Republic of Georgia]] by [[Russian SFSR|Soviet Russia]] in 1921.

The events of April 9 also gave rise to the so-called 'Tbilisi Syndrome'. This syndrome was characterized by the reluctance of military officers and soldiers to take any tactical decisions or even obey orders without a clear trail of responsibility to a higher authority. It arose because of the Soviet leadership's refusal to take responsibility for the orders to clear the square and the commission report's and Shevardnadze's criticism of the military in general. 'Tbilisi Syndrome' continued to spread in the coming years, especially following events in Baku and Vilnius, and contributed in 1991 to the refusal of soldiers to prevent demonstrations during the August 1991 putsch.&lt;ref&gt;Lehrke, Jesse Paul. The Transition to National Armies in the Former Soviet Republics, 1988-2005.” Oxfordshire, UK: Routledge (2013), Chapter 2 and 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 31, 1991, Georgians voted overwhelmingly in favor of independence from the [[Soviet Union]] in a [[Georgian independence referendum, 1991|referendum]].  With a 90.5% turnout, approximately 99% voted in favor of independence. On April 9, the second anniversary of the tragedy, the [[Supreme Council of the Republic of Georgia]] proclaimed Georgian sovereignty and independence from the Soviet Union.

A memorial to the victims of the tragedy was opened at the location of the crackdown on [[Rustaveli Avenue]] on November 23, 2004.

"'''Celtic Tiger'''" ({{lang-ga|An Tíogar Ceilteach}}) is a term referring to the [[economy of the Republic of Ireland]] from the mid-1990s to the late-2000s, a period of rapid real economic growth fuelled by foreign direct investment. The boom was dampened by a subsequent [[property bubble]] which resulted in a severe economic downturn.

At the start of the 1990s, Ireland was a poor country by West European standards, with high poverty, unemployment, inflation, and low growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/02/world/europe/suddenly-rich-poor-old-ireland-seems-bewildered.html|title=Suddenly Rich, Poor Old Ireland Seems Bewildered|first=Lizette|last=Alvarez|date=2 February 2005|publisher=|accessdate=5 April 2018|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Irish economy expanded at an average rate of 9.4% between 1995 and 2000 and continued to grow at an average rate of 5.9% during the following decade until 2008, when it [[Post-2008 Irish economic downturn|fell into recession]]. Ireland's rapid growth has been described as a rare example of a Western country to match the growth of East Asian nations, i.e. the '[[Four Asian Tigers]]'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/node/3261071|title=The luck of the Irish|author=|date=|website=The Economist|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Term ==
The [[colloquial]] term "Celtic Tiger"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irelandinformationguide.com/History_of_rail_transport_in_Ireland |title=Ireland Information Guide, Irish, Counties, Facts, Statistics, Tourism, Culture, How |publisher=Irelandinformationguide.com |date= |accessdate=21 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001222814/http://www.irelandinformationguide.com/History_of_rail_transport_in_Ireland |archivedate= 1 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; has been used to refer to the country itself, and to the years associated with the boom. The first recorded use of the phrase is in a 1994 [[Morgan Stanley]] report by Kevin Gardiner.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/6715664/A-Critical-Perspective Reinventing Ireland: Culture, Society and the Global Economy] (2002) Peadar Kirby, Luke Gibbons, Michael Cronin, p. 17. {{ISBN|0 7453 1825 8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The term refers to Ireland's similarity to the [[East Asian Tigers]]: Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan during their periods of rapid growth in the early 1960s and late 1990s. ''An Tíogar Ceilteach'', the [[Irish language]] version of the term, appears in the [[Foras na Gaeilge]] terminology database&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tearma.ie/Search.aspx?term=an+T%C3%ADogar+Ceilteach&amp;lang=3116659 |title=Tearma.ie - Dictionary of Irish Terms - Foclóir Téarmaíochta |publisher= |accessdate=18 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been used in government and administrative contexts since at least 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2005041900020?opendocument Irish Parliamentary Debates] - Deputy McGinley: "go speisialta ó tháinig an tíogar Ceilteach chun cinn"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.president.ie/speeches/annual-showcase-of-young-social-innovators-2012/ Speech by the President of Ireland] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213044817/http://www.president.ie/speeches/annual-showcase-of-young-social-innovators-2012/ |date=13 December 2013 }} "is measa a bhain leis an Tíogar Ceilteach"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.galway.ie/ga/Seirbhisi/Timpeallacht/BainistiuDramhaiola/Bhileogaeolaislehaghaidhnahearnalateaghlaigh/gaeilge%20travel%20handbook.pdf Galway County Council] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131217045611/http://www.galway.ie/ga/Seirbhisi/Timpeallacht/BainistiuDramhaiola/Bhileogaeolaislehaghaidhnahearnalateaghlaigh/gaeilge%20travel%20handbook.pdf |date=17 December 2013 }} - "ó na 1990í i leith an Tíogar Ceilteach"&lt;/ref&gt;

The Celtic Tiger period has also been called [[Economic boom|"The Boom"]] or "Ireland's Economic Miracle".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Celtic Tiger: Ireland's Economic Miracle Explained|url=http://www.dublinwastetoenergy.ie/archive/files/info_sessions/Statutory/Processes/Presentation.ppt |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180903045749/https://www.dublinwastetoenergy.ie/archive/files/info_sessions/Statutory/Processes/Presentation.ppt |dead-url=yes |archive-date=3 September 2018 | work=Dublic Water to Energy |accessdate=8 August 2009 }} &lt;/ref&gt;  During that time, the country experienced a period of economic growth that transformed it from one of Western Europe's poorer countries into one of its wealthiest. The causes of Ireland's growth are the subject of some debate, but credit has been primarily given{{by whom|date=June 2014}} to state-driven economic development; [[social partnership]] among employers, government and [[trade union]]s; increased participation by women in the labour force; decades of investment in domestic higher education; targeting of [[foreign direct investment]]; a low [[corporation tax]] rate; an English-speaking workforce; and membership of the [[European Union]], which provided transfer payments and export access to the [[Single Market]].

By mid-2007, in the wake of the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2010|growing global financial crisis]], the Celtic Tiger had all but died. Some critics, such as [[David McWilliams (economics pundit)|David McWilliams]], who had been warning about impending collapse for some time, concluded: "The case is clear: an economically challenged government, perniciously influenced by the interests of the housing lobby, blew it. The entire Irish episode will be studied internationally in years to come as an example of how not to do things."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sbpost.ie/post/pages/p/story.aspx-qqqt=DAVID+McWilliams-qqqs=commentandanalysis-qqqid=38577-qqqx=1.asp|title=The Sunday Business Post|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101113070817/http://www.sbpost.ie/post/pages/p/story.aspx-qqqt=DAVID+McWilliams-qqqs=commentandanalysis-qqqid=38577-qqqx=1.asp|archive-date=13 November 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Richard Aldous stated the Celtic Tiger has now gone the "way of the [[Dodo (bird)|dodo]]". In early 2008, many commentators thought a [[soft landing (economics)|soft landing]] was likely, but by January 2009, it seemed possible the country could experience a [[Depression (economics)|depression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/cowen-must-be-mister-fixit-not-a-master-of-disaster-1586804.html|title=Cowen must be Mister Fix-It, not a master of disaster|work=Independent.ie|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In early January 2009, ''[[The Irish Times]]'', in an editorial, declared:
"We have gone from the Celtic Tiger to an era of financial fear with the suddenness of a [[HMS Titanic|Titanic]]-style shipwreck, thrown from comfort, even luxury, into a cold sea of uncertainty."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2009/0103/1230842387565.html|title=No time for whingers|work=Irish Times|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tribune.ie/article/2009/jan/25/so-who-got-us-into-this-mess/ So Who Got Us Into This Mess?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091010201658/http://www.tribune.ie/article/2009/jan/25/so-who-got-us-into-this-mess/ |date=10 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In February 2010, a report by Davy Research concluded that Ireland had "largely wasted” its years of high income during the boom, with private enterprise investing its wealth "in the wrong places". It compared Ireland's growth to other small [[eurozone]] countries such as Finland and Belgium&amp;nbsp;– noting that the physical wealth of those countries exceeds that of Ireland because of their "vastly superior" transport infrastructure, telecommunications network, and public services.&lt;ref name='davyresearch'&gt;{{cite news | first=Rossa | last=White | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Fruits of boom largely wasted, says Davy report | date=2 October 2010 | publisher=[[The Irish Times]] | url =http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/finance/2010/0220/1224264879149.html | work =The Irish Times | pages = | accessdate = 20 February 2010 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tiger economy ==
From 1995 to 2000, [[GDP]] growth rate ranged between 7.8 and 11.5%; it then slowed to between 4.4 and 6.5% from 2001 to 2007.&lt;ref name="International Monetary Fund"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2002/cr02170.pdf |format=PDF |title = IMF Staff Country Report No. 02/170|publisher = International Monetary Fund}}&lt;/ref&gt; During that period, the Irish GDP per capita rose dramatically to equal, then eventually surpass, that of all but one state in Western Europe. Although GDP does not represent the [[standard of living]], and the [[GNP]] remained lower than the GDP, in 2007, the GNP achieved the same level as of some other Western European countries'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finfacts.ie/irishfinancenews/article_1025366.shtml Irish Economy: Sustainable growth dependent on foreign firms since 1990] – website article, 22 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Causes ===

==== Tax policy ====
Many economists credit Ireland's growth to a low [[corporate tax]]ation rate (10 to 12.5% throughout the late 1990s). Since 1956, successive Irish governments have pursued low-taxation policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/opinion/editorial/lowtax-policies-created-the-tiger-485406.html| title = Low-tax policies created the Tiger (Ireland's Economy)| accessdate = 2 November 2006|work=Irish Independent| date=24 October 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.revenue.ie/budget/budget1997/income.htm#Tax%20Rates,%20Bands%20&amp;%20Tables |title=Budget 1997 |publisher=[[Office of the Revenue Commissioners|Revenue Commissioners]] |accessdate=19 May 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070517021054/http://www.revenue.ie/budget/budget1997/income.htm |archivedate=17 May 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

==== European Union Structural and Cohesion Funds ====
Since joining the EU in 1973, Ireland has received over €17 billion in EU Structural and Cohesion Funds. These are made up of the [[European Regional Development Fund]] (ERDF) and the [[European Social Fund]] (ESF) and were used to increase investment in the [[Education in the Republic of Ireland|education system]] and to build physical infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;name = "EU support for Irish Regions"[http://www.iro.ie/EU-structural-funds.html "The Irish Regions Office" Retrieved 28 March 2013] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918031401/http://www.iro.ie/EU-structural-funds.html |date=18 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These [[transfer payment]]s from members of the [[European Union]], such as [[Economy of Germany|Germany]] and [[Economy of France|France]], were as high as 4% of Ireland's [[gross national product]] (GNP). Ireland is unique among cohesion countries, having allocated up to 35% of its Structural Funds to human resource investments, compared with an average of around 25% for other cohesion fund recipients. The Irish economy's increased productive capacity is sometimes attributed to these investments, which made Ireland more attractive to high-tech businesses,&lt;ref name="heritage"&gt;Sean Dorgan [http://www.heritage.org/Research/WorldwideFreedom/bg1945.cfm "How Ireland Became the Celtic Tiger"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100303165903/http://www.heritage.org/Research/WorldwideFreedom/bg1945.cfm |date=3 March 2010 }} The Heritage Foundation: 23 June 2006. Retrieved 6 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; though the libertarian [[Cato Institute]] has suggested that the EU transfer payments were economically inefficient and may have actually slowed growth.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Powell(2003). [http://www.cato.org/dailys/04-21-03.html Markets Created a Pot of Gold in Ireland] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706011854/http://www.cato.org/dailys/04-21-03.html |date= 6 July 2008 }}. Cato Institute. Accessed 4 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The conservative [[The Heritage Foundation|Heritage Foundation]] also attributed to transfer payments no significant role in causing growth.&lt;ref name="heritage"/&gt;

==== Trade within the European Union ====
Ireland's membership in the EU since 1973 helped the country gain access to Europe's large markets. Ireland's trade had previously been predominantly with the [[Economy of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name="economist1"&gt;[http://www.economist.com/surveys/showsurvey.cfm?issue=20041016 "The luck of the Irish".] ''[[The Economist]]'', 14 October 2004. Retrieved 6 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Industrial policies ====
In the 1990s, the provision of [[subsidies]] and investment capital by Irish state organisations (such as [[IDA Ireland]]) encouraged high-profile companies, such as [[Dell]], [[Intel]], and [[Microsoft]], to locate in Ireland; these companies were attracted to Ireland because of its EU membership, relatively low wages, government [[Grant (money)|grants]],{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} and low tax rates. Enterprise Ireland,&lt;ref name="Home - Enterprise Ireland"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enterprise-ireland.com/|title=Home - Enterprise Ireland|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a state agency, provides financial, technical, and social support to start-up businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/17/business/smallbusiness/17edge.html?_r=2&amp;ref=business&amp;oref=login&amp;oref=slogin. | work=The New York Times | title=Entrepreneurship Takes Off in Ireland | first=James | last=Flanigan | date=17 January 2008 | accessdate=1 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, the building of the [[International Financial Services Centre]] in Dublin led to the creation of 14,000 high-value jobs in the accounting, legal, and financial management sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ifsc.ie/page.aspx?idpage=6|title=I.F.S.C |publisher = I.F.S.C.ie |date= 21 June 2010 |accessdate=28 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2003, the government established the [[Science Foundation Ireland]]&lt;ref name="sfi.ie"&gt;[http://www.sfi.ie/about/history/ Web site of Science Foundation Ireland] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312045501/http://www.sfi.ie/about/history/ |date=12 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; on a statutory basis to promote education for highly skilled careers, particularly in biotechnology and information and communications technology, with the additional purpose to invest in science initiatives that aim to further Ireland's [[knowledge economy]].

US firms were drawn to Ireland by cheap wage costs compared to the UK, and by the limited government intervention in business {{clarify|date=August 2018}} compared to other EU members, and particularly to countries in Eastern Europe. Growing stability in Northern Ireland brought about by the [[Good Friday Agreement]] further established Ireland's ability to provide a stable business environment.&lt;ref name="economist1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dermot McAleese. [http://ipac.ca/toronto/news_highlights/fall2001/celtic.htm Miracle of the Celtic Tiger: Learning from Ireland's Success] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070623164942/http://ipac.ca/toronto/news_highlights/fall2001/celtic.htm |date=23 June 2007 }}. Accessed 4 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Irish workers can communicate effectively with Americans&amp;nbsp;– especially compared to those in other low-wage{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}, non-English-speaking EU nations, such as Portugal and Spain; this factor was vital {{citation needed|date=August 2018}} to U.S. companies' choosing Ireland for their European headquarters. It has also been argued{{By whom|date=July 2013}} that the [[demographic dividend]] from the rising ratio of workers to dependents due to falling fertility, and increased female labour market participation, increased income per capita.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

== Impact of economic growth ==
[[File:Irish GDPDebt Ratio Chart.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Public debt as a percentage of GDP dropped significantly over the 1990s.]]
Ireland was transformed from one of the poorest countries in Western Europe to one of the wealthiest.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} [[Disposable income]] soared to record levels, enabling a huge rise in consumer spending with foreign holidays accounting for over 91% of total holiday expenditure in 2004. However, the gap between the highest and lowest income households widened in the five-year period to 2004-2005;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.cso.ie/en/media/csoie/releasespublications/documents/housing/hbs.pdf |format=PDF |title = Household Budget Survey 2004 -05 |publisher = Central Statistics Office | date= July 2007 | accessdate= 28 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in response, the [[Economic and Social Research Institute]] (ESRI) stated in 2002: "On balance, budgets over the past 10 to 20 years have been more favourable to high income groups than low income groups, but particularly so during periods of high growth".&lt;ref name="ESRI Dublin"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/eiro/2002/10/feature/ie0210203f.htm |title = 'The distributive impact of budgetary policy: A medium term view'|publisher = ESRI Dublin | year= 2002 | accessdate= 28 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unemployment fell from 18% in the late 1980s to 4.5% by the end of 2007,&lt;ref&gt;Central Statistics Office: Quarterly National Household Survey for Q4 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and average industrial wages grew at one of the highest rates in Europe. Inflation brushed 5% per annum towards the end of the "Tiger" period, pushing Irish prices up to those of Nordic Europe, even though wage rates are roughly the same as in the UK. The national debt had remained constant during the boom, but the GDP to debt ratio rose, due to the dramatic rise in GDP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.business2000.ie/cases/cases_7th/case21.htm|title=Business 2000&amp;nbsp;– Case Studies for the Classroom.

The new wealth resulted in large investments in modernising Irish infrastructure and cities. The [[National Development Plan]] led to improvements in roads, and new transport services were developed, such as the [[Luas]] light rail lines, the [[Dublin Port Tunnel]], and the extension of the [[Cork Suburban Rail]]. Local authorities enhanced city streets and built monuments such as the [[Spire of Dublin]].&lt;ref&gt;name = "REGIONAL PROGRAMMES WITHIN THE NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN 2000-2006"[http://www.iro.ie/EU-NDP-2000-2006.html "The Irish Regions Office" Retrieved 28 March 2013] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120709041220/http://www.iro.ie/EU-NDP-2000-2006.html |date= 9 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ireland's trend of net emigration was reversed as the republic became a destination for immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.cso.ie/en/media/csoie/releasespublications/documents/population/2003/popmig_2003.pdf| format=PDF |title = Population and Migration Estimates April 2003 |publisher = Central Statistics Office | date= 10 December 2003 | accessdate= 28 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This significantly changed Irish demographics and resulted in expanding [[multiculturalism]]{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}, particularly in the [[Dublin]], [[Cork (city)|Cork]], [[Limerick]], and [[Galway]] areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.cso.ie/en/media/csoie/releasespublications/documents/population/2005/popmig_2005.pdf|format=PDF |title = Population and Migration Estimates April 2005 |publisher = Central Statistics Office | date= 14 September 2005 | accessdate= 28 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was estimated{{who|date=July 2013}} in 2007 that 10% of Irish residents were foreign-born; most of the new arrivals were citizens of Poland and the Baltic states, many of whom found work in the retail and service sectors. A study conducted in 2006 found that many Irish people regarded immigration as an important factor for economic progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ssb.no/a/english/publikasjoner/pdf/sa104/attitudes.pdf|format=PDF|title = Attitudes towards immigrants and immigration | publisher = Immigration and immigrants}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Within Ireland, many young people left the rural countryside to live and work in urban centres.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}
Many people in Ireland believe that the growing consumerism during the boom years eroded the [[culture of Ireland|country's culture]], with the adoption of American capitalist ideals. While Ireland's historical economic ties to the UK had often been the subject of criticism, Peader Kirby argued that the new ties to the US economy were met with a "satisfied silence".&lt;ref&gt;Paul Keenan. [http://www.dcu.ie/news/pub/pub4.shtml Book review of Peader Kirby's ''The Celtic Tiger In Distress''.] Accessed 4 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, voices on the political left have decried the "closer to Boston than Berlin" philosophy of the [[Members of the 29th Dáil|Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrat government]].&lt;ref name="independent"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/ffpd-policy-to-blame-for-economic-ills-claims-report-2554051.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130218004009/http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/ffpd-policy-to-blame-for-economic-ills-claims-report-2554051.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=18 February 2013 |work=Irish Independent |first=Siobhan |last=Creaton |title=FF-PD policy to blame for economic ills, claims report |date=24 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Writers such as [[William Wall (writer)|William Wall]], Mike McCormick, and [[Gerry Murphy (poet)|Gerry Murphy]] have satirised these developments. Growing wealth was blamed for rising crime levels among youths, particularly alcohol-related violence resulting from increased spending power. However, it was also accompanied by rapidly increased life expectancy and very high quality of life ratings; the country ranked first in ''The Economist'''s 2005 quality of life index, &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.economist.com/media/pdf/QUALITY_OF_LIFE.pdf|format=PDF |title = The Economist Intelligence Unit’s quality-of-life index|publisher = The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt; dropping to 12th by 2013.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/the-where-to-be-born-index-the-highest-and-lowest-scoring-countries.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The growing success of Ireland's economy encouraged [[entrepreneurship]] and risk-taking, qualities that had been dormant during poor economic periods. However, whilst some semblance of a culture of entrepreneurship exists, foreign-owned companies account for 93% of Ireland's exports.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url = http://www.finfacts.ie/irishfinancenews/article_1016593.shtml |title = Irish Economy: Home Truths on Irish Exports as Ireland faces a changed global economy in the decade ahead|date=4 May 2009 |publisher =Finfacts Team}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The economy was adversely affected by a large reduction in investment in the worldwide information technology (IT) industry. The industry had over-expanded in the late 1990s, and its stock market equity declined sharply. Ireland was a major player in the IT industry: in 2002, it had exported US$10.4 billion worth of computer services, compared to $6.9 billion from the US. Ireland accounted for approximately 50% of all mass-market packaged software sold in Europe in 2002 (OECD, 2002; OECD, 2004).{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

[[Foot and mouth disease]] and the [[11 September 2001 attacks]] damaged Ireland's tourism and agricultural sectors {{dubious|date=August 2018}}, deterring U.S. and British tourists.

At the same time, economies globally experienced a slowdown. The US economy grew only 0.3% in April, May, and June 2002 from a year earlier, and the [[Federal Reserve]] made 11 rate cuts that year{{which|date=July 2013}} in an attempt to stimulate the US economy. The EU scarcely grew throughout the whole of 2002, and many members' governments (notably in Germany and France) lost control of [[public finance]]s, causing large deficits that broke the terms of the EMU [[Stability and Growth Pact]].{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

The economic downturn in Ireland was not a [[recession]] but a slowdown in the rate of economic expansion. Signs of a recovery became evident in late 2003, as US investment levels increased once again.

== Challenges ==

[[File:The Spire of Dublin from Henry Street 2006-06-16.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Spire of Dublin]] symbolises the modernisation and growing prosperity of Ireland.]]

=== Property market ===
The return of the boom in 2004 was claimed to be primarily the result of the large construction sector's catching up with the demand caused by the first boom. The construction sector represented nearly 12% of GDP and a large proportion of employment among young, unskilled men. A number of sources, including ''[[The Economist]],''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/finance/displayStory.cfm?story_id=4079027 The global housing boom.] ''[[The Economist]]'': 16 June 2005. Accessed 4 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; warned of [[Irish property bubble|excessive Irish property values]]. 2004 saw the construction of 80,000 new homes, compared to the UK's 160,000&amp;nbsp;– a nation that has 15 times Ireland's population. House prices doubled between 2000 and 2006; tax incentives were a key driver of this price rise,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=//www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/leaflets/it65.pdf |title=Tax Reliefs for Owner-Occupied and Rented Residential Accommodation |author=Charlie McCreevy TD Minister for Finance |publisher=Department of the Environment and Local Government/An Roinn Comhshaoil agus Rialtais Aitiuil |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111104193158/https://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/leaflets/it65.pdf |archivedate=4 November 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Fianna Fáil]]-[[Progressive Democrats]] government subsequently received substantial criticism for these policies.&lt;ref name="independent"/&gt;

In January 2009, [[University College Dublin|UCD]] economist Morgan Kelly predicted that house prices would fall by 80% from peak to trough in real terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/finance/2009/0113/1231738220759.html|title=Warning that house prices may fall by 80%|work=Irish Times|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Loss of competitiveness ===
Rising wages, inflation, and excessive public spending&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.audgen.gov.ie/documents/vfmreports/VFM_51_PPARS_Report.pdf |title=Development of Human Resource Management System for the Health Service (PPARS) | author=John Purcell, Comptroller and Auditor General|date=8 December 2005|work=Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General }}&lt;/ref&gt; led to a loss of competitiveness in the Irish economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2008/wp0802.pdf |format=PDF |title = IMF Working Paper 08/02 Spillovers to Ireland | author=Daniel Kanda, |publisher = International Monetary Fund}}&lt;/ref&gt; Irish wages were substantially above the EU average, particularly in the Dublin region, though [[Expansion of the European Union|many poorer Eastern European states had joined the EU since 2004]], substantially lowering the average EU wage below its 1995 level. Low-paid sectors, such as retail and hospitality, remained below the EU-15 average, however. The pressures primarily affect unskilled, semi-skilled, and manufacturing jobs. Outsourcing of professional jobs also increased, with Poland in 2008 gaining several hundred former Irish jobs from the accountancy divisions of [[Philips]] and [[Dell]].{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

=== Promotion of indigenous industry ===
One of the major challenges facing Ireland is the successful promotion of indigenous industry. Although Ireland boasted a few large international companies, such as [[Allied Irish Banks|AIB]], CRH, [[Élan]],  [[Kerry Group]], [[Ryanair]], and [[Smurfit Kappa]], there are few companies with over one billion euros in annual revenue. The government has charged Enterprise Ireland&lt;ref name="Home - Enterprise Ireland"/&gt; with the task of boosting Ireland's indigenous industry and launched a website&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.basis.ie/|title=Supporting SMEs Online Tool|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060709041234/http://www.basis.ie/|archive-date=9 July 2006|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2003 with the objective of streamlining and marketing the process of starting a business in Ireland.

=== Reliance on foreign energy sources ===
Ireland relies on imported fossil fuels for over 80% of its energy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Forfás]] (2006).{{cite web|url=http://www.forfas.ie/publications/forfas060404/webopt/forfas060404_irelands_oil_dependence_report.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060524143349/http://www.forfas.ie/publications/forfas060404/webopt/forfas060404_irelands_oil_dependence_report.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=24 May 2006 |title=''A Baseline Assessment of Ireland’s Oil Dependence&amp;nbsp;– key policy considerations.'' }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(9.88&amp;nbsp;KB)}} Retrieved 8 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ESB&gt;[[ESB Group|ESB]] (2006) {{cite web|url=http://www.dcenr.gov.ie/NR/rdonlyres/54C78A1E-4E96-4E28-A77A-3226220DF2FC/27077/ESBCommentsonGreenPaper.pdf |title=ESB Comments on GreenPaper ''Towards a Sustainable Energy Future for Ireland'' |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318164748/http://www.dcenr.gov.ie/NR/rdonlyres/54C78A1E-4E96-4E28-A77A-3226220DF2FC/27077/ESBCommentsonGreenPaper.pdf |archivedate=18 March 2009 |df= }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(237&amp;nbsp;KB)}} Retrieved 5 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ireland for many years in the middle twentieth century limited its dependence on external energy sources by developing its [[peat]] bogs, building various [[hydroelectric]] projects, including a dam at [[Ardnacrusha (village)|Ardnacrusha]] on the [[River Shannon]] in 1928, developing [[Oil platform|offshore]] gas fields, and diversifying into coal in the 1970s. As gas, peat, and hydroelectric power have been almost fully exploited in Ireland, there is a continuously increasing need for imported fossil fuels at a time of increasing concerns about [[peak oil|security of supply]] and [[global warming]]. One solution is to develop alternative energy sources, including [[wind power]] and, to a lesser extent, [[wave power]]. Wind,however, is not a panacea&lt;ref name=ESB/&gt; as it needs to have conventional plants to augment it. 

An offshore [[wind farm]] is currently{{when|date=July 2013}} under construction off the east coast near [[Arklow]], and many remote locations in the west show potential for wind farm development. A report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seai.ie/Publications/Statistics_Publications/Renewable_Energy_in_Ireland/Renewable+Energy+in+Ireland+-+2008+Report+%E2%80%93+Focus+on+Wind+Energy+and+Biofuels.pdf|title=Publications - Resources - SEAI|author=|date=|website=Sustainable Energy Authority Of Ireland - SEAI|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Sustainable Energy Ireland indicated that if wind power were properly developed, Ireland could{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} one day be exporting excess wind power if the natural difficulties of integrating wind power into the national grid are solved. Wind power by November 2009 already accounted for 15.4% of total installed generating capacity in the state. By 2020, the Irish government forecasts that 40% of the country's energy needs will come from renewable sources, well above the EU average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sei.ie/Renewables/Wind_Energy/ |title=Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland | accessdate = 23 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Distribution of wealth ===
Ireland's new wealth is unevenly distributed.&lt;ref name="ESRI Dublin"/&gt; The [[United Nations]] reported in 2004 that Ireland was second only to the US in inequality among Western nations.&lt;ref name="guardian1"/&gt; There is some opposition to the theory that Ireland's wealth has been unusually unevenly distributed, among them economist and journalist [[David McWilliams (economics pundit)|David McWilliams]]. He cites [[Eurostat]] figures which indicate that Ireland is just above average in terms equality by one type of measurement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.davidmcwilliams.ie/2006/11/19/friedman-the-free-thinker|title=Friedman the free thinker - David McWilliams|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204011229/http://www.davidmcwilliams.ie/2006/11/19/friedman-the-free-thinker|archive-date=4 February 2009|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, while it is better off by this measurement than generally less developed or more free market countries like Britain, the Mediterranean, and the new accession states, Ireland is still more unequal than France, Germany, and the Scandinavian countries. Moreover, Ireland's inequality persists by other measurements. According to an ESRI report published in December 2006, Ireland's child poverty level ranks 22nd out of the 26 richest countries, and it is the 2nd most unequal country in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.village.ie/Opinion/Editorial/The_promises_of_greed/ village.ie - Editorial: The promises of greed] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202181834/http://www.village.ie/Opinion/Editorial/The_promises_of_greed/ |date= 2 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death of the Tiger ==
In an economic analysis, the [[Economic and Social Research Institute]] (ESRI) on 24 June 2008 forecasted the possibility the Irish economy would experience marginal negative growth in 2008. This would be the first time since 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/we-blew-the-boom-1419958.html|title=We blew the boom|work=Independent.ie|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Outlining possible prospects for the economy for 2008, the ESRI said output of goods and services might fall that year—which would have been the Irish definition of a mild recession.

The recession was confirmed by figures from the [[Central Statistics Office (Ireland)|Central Statistics Office]] showing the bursting of the property bubble and a collapse in consumer spending that terminated the boom that was the Celtic Tiger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/irishexaminer/pages/story.aspx-qqqg=ireland-qqqm=ireland-qqqa=ireland-qqqid=73270-qqqx=1.asp|title=Page not Found - Irish Examiner|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202103830/http://www.irishexaminer.com/irishexaminer/pages/story.aspx-qqqg=ireland-qqqm=ireland-qqqa=ireland-qqqid=73270-qqqx=1.asp|archivedate=2 February 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2008/0929/breaking58.html|title=Gilmore says Govt has no strategy to get out of recession|work=Irish Times|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The figures show the gross domestic product (GDP), which measures the value of all the goods and services produced in the State, fell 0.8% in the second three months of 2008 compared with the same quarter of 2007.

In a November 2008 interview in'' [[Hot Press]],'' in a grim assessment of where Ireland stood, then Taoiseach [[Brian Cowen]] said many people still did not realise how badly shaken the public finances were.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.herald.ie/national-news/cowen-public--needs-to-wake-up-to-current-financial-crisis-1524706.html|title=Cowen: Public needs to wake up to current financial crisis|work=Herald.ie|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By 30 January 2009, Ireland’s government debt had become the riskiest in the euro zone, surpassing Greece’s sovereign bonds, according to credit-default swap prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2009/0130/breaking42.html?via=mr|title=Ireland's Gov't debt now rated riskiest in Europe|work=Irish Times|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In February 2009, Taoiseach Brian Cowen said that Ireland's economy appeared on course to contract by 6.5% in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/|title=Breaking News, World News &amp; Multimedia|author=|date=|website=nytimes.com|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==
Former Taoiseach [[Garret FitzGerald]] blamed Ireland's dire economic state in 2009 on a series of "calamitous" government policy errors. Between the years of 2000 and 2003 the then Finance Minister [[Charlie McCreevy]] boosted public spending by 48% while cutting income tax. A second problem occurred when government policies allowed, or even encouraged, a housing [[bubble (economics)|bubble]] to develop, "on an immense scale".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/fitzgerald-says-crisis-started-with-mccreevy-1606203.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120525211649/http://www.independent.ie/national-news/fitzgerald-says-crisis-started-with-mccreevy-1606203.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=25 May 2012 |title=FitzGerald says crisis started with McCreevy |work=Independent.ie |accessdate=18 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, he wrote nothing of the impact of the [[European Central Bank]]'s low interest rates which funded the property bubble and further exacerbated the overheating economy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/opinion/editorial/look-to-boston-not-to-berlin-26232084.html|title=Look to Boston, not to Berlin|work=Independent.ie|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''“As far as responding to the recession goes, Ireland appears to be really, truly without options, other than to hope for an export-led recovery, if and when the rest of the world bounces back.”''

The [[International Monetary Fund]] in mid-April 2009 forecast a very poor outlook for Ireland. It projected that the Irish economy would contract by 8 per cent in 2009 and by 3 per cent in 2010&amp;nbsp;– and that might be on the optimistic side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sbpost.ie/post/pages/p/story.aspx-qqqt=VINCENT+BROWNE-qqqs=commentandanalysis-qqqid=41280-qqqx=1.asp|title=The Sunday Business Post|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090701133709/http://www.sbpost.ie/post/pages/p/story.aspx-qqqt=VINCENT+BROWNE-qqqs=commentandanalysis-qqqid=41280-qqqx=1.asp|archivedate=1 July 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/frontpage/2009/0422/1224245137788.html|title=IMF warns Ireland will pay highest price to secure banks|author=|date=|website=irishtimes.com|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unemployment in Ireland was forecasted to rise almost 17 percent in 2010, the [[Economic and Social Research Institute]] (ESRI) stated in a report published on 28 April 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2009/0429/breaking18.html?via=mr|title=Unemployment to hit 17% - ESRI|work=Irish Times|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; however the unemployment rate in 2010 steadied at 14%. In 2012, the unemployment rate was at 14.8 percent, and in order to escape economic downfall, Ireland requested €67.5 billion ($85.7 billion) from the International Monetary Fund and members of the euro area. Taking the money meant accepting austerity: The government has cut expenditure by 15 percent over three years, consumer spending has dropped for six straight quarters, and young Irish by the thousands have emigrated to Australia and elsewhere.

On 19 November 2010, The Irish Government had begun talks on a multibillion-dollar economic assistance package with experts from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the European Union.

In mid-2011 the ratings agency [[Moody's]] proceeded to downgrade Ireland's government bond ratings to junk.&lt;ref&gt;[http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/world/2011-07-12-ireland-moodys-junk-rating_n.htm ] date=March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural impact==

The Celtic Tiger had more than just an economic impact, impacting also Ireland's social backdrop. 2007 research by the [[Economic and Social Research Institute]], prior to the crash, found that fears over wider social inequality, declining community life, and a more selfish, materialist approach to life were largely unfounded, and that the social impact of the Celtic Tiger had largely been positive. The economic boom led to lower levels of emigration and higher immigration than had been historically been the case, and the government at the time did acknowledge that placed a strain on some public services and Ireland's approach to integration. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; | title=Social effects of the Celtic Tiger | url=https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/social-effects-of-the-celtic-tiger-1.1212643 | publisher=The Irish Times | date=29 June 2007 | access-date=23 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.esri.ie/pubs/BKMNEXT96.pdf | title=Best of Times?

'''Fameal''' is a general word for a food product, used by [[Non-governmental organizations]] (NGOs), in programs to feed the hungry as a part of the [[Agricultural Act of 1949]]. The food product is made up of a wheat-soy meal blend of a [[cornmeal]]-soy blend (WSB or CSB, [[corn soy blend]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=COMMODITIES REFERENCE GUIDE  FACT SHEET: CORN SOY BLEND |url=http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/humanitarian_assistance/ffp/crg/downloads/fscornsoyblend.pdf |publisher=USDA:FSA:PDD:EOB April, 1996 |accessdate=7 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218031623/http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/humanitarian_assistance/ffp/crg/downloads/fscornsoyblend.pdf |archivedate=18 February 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This food is distributed, often aided by volunteers, in the [[Caribbean]] and [[West Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fuguitt |first=Dana |title=THE IMPACT OF EXTRUDED CORN-SOYA BLENDS ON RURAL NJOMBE WOMEN'S TIME AND WELFARE:  A MODEL FOR PRE-PROJECT MARKETING ANALYSES |journal=Michigan State University, Eckerd College |year=1991 |url=http://gencen.isp.msu.edu/documents/Working_Papers/WP224.pdf |accessdate=7 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111228221058/http://gencen.isp.msu.edu/documents/Working_Papers/WP224.pdf |archivedate=28 December 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Typical usage==
A premade mix of fameal is [[Food extrusion|extrusion]] cooked for usage under primitive conditions. In this form, the meal is eaten as a thin paste or thickened and made into dumplings or bread. The taste is sometimes described as "foody" and some  consider it  delicious.  The cooked product can be added to soups and casseroles or made into cookies.

==Nutritional components==

The general measures of fameal are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=USAID Section II: Food Commodity Fact Sheets, Corn Soy Blend |url=http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/humanitarian_assistance/ffp/crg/fscornsoyblend.htm |accessdate=7 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120410052121/http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/humanitarian_assistance/ffp/crg/fscornsoyblend.htm |archivedate=10 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 50% (by volume) [[Cornmeal]] or [[Whole-wheat flour|Wheat Meal]].
* 30% (by volume) Bean meal, of any kind, including soy. [[Lentil]]s are sometimes used due to ease of grinding and fast cooking.
* 10% (by volume) Cooking Oil. Any cooking oil works.
* 10% (by volume) Sugar, honey, syrup, or similar sweetener.
* Salt for taste.
* Multi-vitamin powder, or multi-vitamins ground to a meal.

In [[Preparation (principle)|preparation]], the fameal is a powder which can be mixed slowly with boiling water (three cups of water per cup of meal). Once boiling, remove heat, cover, and allow to cook for 10 minutes.  Alternatively, the meal can be used as a flour replacement for baking, similar to [[cornbread]], or as a cake mix.

[[File:2011 Greece Uprising.jpg|thumb|100,000 people protest against the austerity measures in front of parliament building in Athens (29 May 2011).]]

The '''First Economic Adjustment Programme for Greece''', initially called the '''Economic Adjustment Programme for Greece''' and usually referred to as the '''first bailout package''' or the '''first memorandum''', is a [[memorandum of understanding]] on financial assistance to the [[Hellenic Republic]] in order to cope with the [[Greek government-debt crisis]].

It was signed on 3 May 2010 by the [[Government of Greece|Greek Government]] under then-prime minister [[George Papandreou]] on one hand, and on the other hand by the [[European Commission]] on behalf of the [[Eurogroup]], the [[European Central Bank]] (ECB) and the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF).

Of the totaling €107.3 billion of financial assistance, €72.8 billion were disbursed by 1 March 2012, when the programme was superseded by the [[Second Economic Adjustment Programme for Greece]] comprising the undisbursed amounts of the first programme and additional €130 billion for the years 2012–14.

==Background==
{{main|Greek government-debt crisis}}
Having had the credit rating agencies further downgraded Greece's ability to achieve and the risk premiums on long-term Greek [[government bonds]] first record levels, the Greek government on 23 April 2010 requested official financial assistance by the European Union and the IMF.

==Memorandum of Understanding==

On 1–2 May 2010, [[European Commission]], [[European Central Bank]] (ECB) and the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), colloquially called the [[European troika]],&lt;ref name=elp131/&gt; agreed with the Greek government in a three-year financial aid programme that was outlined in a [[Memorandum of Understanding]].

The total amount of €110 billion would consist of €80 billion bilateral loan commitments provided by the [[Eurogroup]] and pooled by the European Commission in the [[Greek Loan Facility]] (GLF), and additional €30 billion to be provided under a [[IMF Stand-By Arrangement|Stand-By Arrangement]] (SBA) by the IMF, which was headed at the time by [[Dominique Strauss-Kahn]].&lt;ref name=elp131/&gt;

Instrumental in determining the rates of the individual euro area countries in the €80bn of the Eurozone was the respective equity interest in the capital of the ECB, which in turn is determined every five years after the prorated share of a country in the total population and economic output in the EU. The German share of the €80bn was 28%, or about €22.4bn in three years&lt;ref name="spiegel_2010-5-9"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/soziales/0,1518,693884,00.html |title= Internationaler Währungsfonds billigt Kredite für Athen. s. hier: Tabelle: Wo das Geld für Griechenland herkommt |work= Spiegel Online | language =German |date=9 May 2010|accessdate=November 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; while France paid €16.8bn.&lt;ref name="France24_04-05-2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20100504-france-approval-greece-rescue-package-parliament-crisis-bailout-financial-aid |title=French lawmakers approve Greece rescue package|publisher=[[France 24]] |date=2010-05-04 |accessdate=November 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The amount of €80 billion to be provided by the Eurogroup was later reduced by €2.7bn, as [[Slovakia]] decided not to participate in the Greek Loan Facility Agreement and as [[Ireland]] and [[Portugal]] had to step down from the facility themselves requesting financial assistance.

===Commitments of the Greek government===

==Disbursement==
In May 2010 Greece received the first [[tranche]] of the bailout loans totaling €20bn.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/wirtschaft/Griechenland-rechnet-mit-zweiter-Tranche-der-IWFEUHilfen/story/15058638?track# Griechenland rechnet mit zweiter Tranche der IWF/EU-Hilfen] tagesanzeiger.ch, 30.

On 13 September the second tranche of €6.5bn was disbursed. The 3rd tranche of the same amount was paid on 19 January 2011. On 16 March, 4th tranche in the amount of €10.9 billion was paid out, followed by the 5th installment on 2 July.&lt;ref name="BMF_Chronologie" /&gt; The 6th tranche of €8bn was paid out after months of delay in early December.

'''The [[Great Depression]] severely affected Central Europe'''. The unemployment rate in [[Germany]], [[Austria]] and [[Poland]] rose to 20% while output fell by 40%.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} By November 1949{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}, every European country had increased [[tariff]]s or introduced [[import quota]]s. 

Under the [[Dawes Plan]], the German economy boomed in the 1920s, paying reparations and increasing domestic production. Germany's economy retracted in 1929 when Congress discontinued the Dawes Plan loans. This was not just a problem for Germany. Europe received almost $8 billion USD in American credit between 1924 and 1930 in addition to previous war time loans.

Germany's [[Weimar Republic]] was hit hard by the depression as American loans to help rebuild the German economy now stopped. Unemployment soared, especially in larger cities. Repayment of the war reparations due by Germany were suspended in 1932 following the [[Lausanne Conference of 1932]]. By that time, Germany had repaid 1/8 of the reparations. People were devastated about how the Weimar Republic dealt with the economy.

Falling prices and demand induced by the crisis created an additional problem in the central European banking system, where the financial system had particularly close relationships with business. In 1931, the [[Creditanstalt]] bank in [[Vienna]] collapsed, causing a financial panic across Europe.

The [[feminist philosophy]] journal [[Hypatia: A Journal of Feminist Philosophy|''Hypatia'']] became involved in a dispute in April 2017 that led to the [[online shaming]] of one of its authors, Rebecca Tuvel, a Canadian [[Academic tenure|untenured]] [[assistant professor]] of philosophy at [[Rhodes College]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]].&lt;ref name=Brubaker18May2017&gt;[[Rogers Brubaker|Brubaker, Rogers]] (18 May 2017). [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/18/opinion/the-uproar-over-transracialism.html "The Uproar Over 'Transracialism'"], ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; The journal had published a [[Scholarly peer review|peer-reviewed]] article by Tuvel in which she compared aspects of the situation of [[Caitlyn Jenner]], a [[trans woman]], to that of [[Rachel Dolezal]], a white woman who identifies as black. When the article was criticized on [[social media]], scholars associated with ''Hypatia'' joined in the criticism and urged the journal to retract it.&lt;ref name=Singal2May2017&gt;Singal, Jesse (2 May 2017). [http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/05/transracialism-article-controversy.html "This Is What a Modern-Day Witch Hunt Looks Like"], ''New York'' magazine.&lt;/ref&gt; The controversy exposed a rift within the journal's editorial team and more broadly within [[feminism]] and academic [[philosophy]].&lt;ref name=McKenzie6May2017/&gt;

In the article—"In Defense of Transracialism", published in ''Hypatia''{{'}}s spring 2017 issue on 25 April—Tuvel argued that "[s]ince we should accept transgender individuals' decisions to change sexes, we should also accept transracial individuals' decisions to change races."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tuvel|first=Rebecca|date=Spring 2017|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/hypa.12327/pdf|title=In Defense of Transracialism|work=Hypatia: A Journal of Feminist Philosophy|volume=32|issue=2|pages=(263–278), 264|doi-access=free|doi=10.1111/hypa.12327|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170510220050/http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/hypa.12327/full|archive-date=10 May 2017|dead-url=yes|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three days later, a small group on [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]]  began criticizing the article and attacking Tuvel. From 29 April an open letter, naming a member of ''Hypatia''{{'}}s editorial board as its point of contact, urged that the article be retracted. The article's publication had sent a message, the letter said, that "white [[Cisgender|cis]] scholars may engage in speculative discussion of these themes" without engaging "theorists whose lives are most directly affected by [[transphobia]] and [[racism]]".&lt;ref name=letter/&gt;&lt;ref name=Singal2May2017/&gt;

On 1 May a post appeared on the journal's Facebook page apologizing for the article's publication, on behalf of "a majority" of ''Hypatia''{{'}}s associate editors.&lt;ref name=Heyes30April2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=Singal2May2017/&gt; By the following day the open letter had 830 signatories,&lt;ref name=Anderson18May2017/&gt; including scholars associated with ''Hypatia'' and two members of Tuvel's [[dissertation committee]].

===Jenner and Dolezal===
Tuvel began writing the article after noticing the contrast, in 2015, between the reception given to [[Caitlyn Jenner]]'s coming out as a [[trans woman]] in April and that given in June to [[Rachel Dolezal]], a white woman who identifies and had been [[Passing (racial identity)|passing]] as black. Jenner became one of ''[[Glamour (magazine)|Glamour]]'' magazine's Women of the Year and appeared on the cover of ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', while Dolezal lost her position as president of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] chapter in [[Spokane]], Washington, and became, in her view, unemployable.&lt;ref&gt;Engber, Daniel (30 May 2017).

Woman's Story Stirs Up a Furor"], ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; Tuvel was not interested in the details of the cases but in their structure. She set about writing an argument in support of the position: "Since we should accept transgender individuals' decisions to change sexes, we should also accept transracial individuals' decisions to change races."{{sfnp|Tuvel|2017|loc=264}}

Tuvel suggests that "[g]enerally, we treat people wrongly when we block them from assuming the personal identity they wish to assume." As an example, she offers [[conversion to Judaism]]. Assuming there is no reason to block the conversion, such as the rabbi doubting the seriousness of the commitment, transition to the new identity will be accepted. Self-identification and social recognition of the new identity are the two components needed for a successful change.{{sfnp|Tuvel|2017|loc=264}}

Tuvel then argues for "an account of race that allows for racial membership on the basis of social treatment and&amp;nbsp;... self-identification".{{sfnp|Tuvel|2017|loc=264}} She maintains that [[Race (human categorization)|race]] is a malleable [[Social constructionism|social construct]] and that, while [[ancestry]]—a feature external to the body—is a highly valued determinant of [[Race and ethnicity in the United States|race in America]], its value varies elsewhere. [[Race and ethnicity in Brazil|In Brazil]], for example, Tuvel suggests that Dolezal's exposure to [[African-American culture|black culture]], self-identification as black, and living as someone society had accepted as black, would be enough to deem her black. From a genetic standpoint, there is no matter of fact, no "real race", Tuvel writes.{{sfnp|Tuvel|2017|loc=266–267}}

Four objections to [[Transracial (identity)|transracialism]] are addressed and rejected. The first is that a claim to be black cannot be accepted without the experience of having grown up with the suffering anti-black [[racism]] causes; Tuvel quotes the journalist [[Touré (journalist)|Touré]], who called this the "one thing that binds black people"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Tuvel|2017|loc=268}}; Schwartz, Ian (16 June 2015). [http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2015/06/16/toure_roasts_rachel_dolezal_the_one_thing_that_binds_black_people_is_the_experience_of_racism.html "Toure Roasts Rachel Dolezal: "The One Thing That Binds Black People Is The Experience Of Racism"], ''RealClear Politics''.&lt;/ref&gt; That trans women are not raised with the suffering caused by [[sexism]] is not reason enough, Tuvel argues, to reject their identification as women. Following this argument, Dolezal's experience of racism while living as a black woman would be sufficient exposure.{{sfnp|Tuvel|2017|loc=268}}

The second objection holds that Dolezal cannot identify as black because of the importance placed on ancestry (in America, at least). No matter the genetic facts, there is [[Intersubjectivity|intersubjective]] agreement that ancestry matters; it is crucial because it is regarded as crucial. Tuvel argues that this position—espoused by [[Cressida Heyes]], the associate editor who posted the apology—holds the possibility of change "hostage to the status quo". How racial categorization does operate is not necessarily how it should operate.{{sfnp|Tuvel|2017|loc=268–269}}

Third, there is an objection that the black community is harmed when a white individual seeks to enter that category; several commentators compared Dolezal's passing as black to the harmful practice of [[blackface]]. Tuvel distinguishes between what she calls problematic and unproblematic identification. Dolezal's self-identification is not based on a change in physical appearance alone; there is nothing obviously insulting about it; her change does not appear to be temporary; there are no questionable ends; and there is no reinforcement of harmful stereotypes. It is therefore an example of unproblematic identification, Tuvel argues.{{sfnp|Tuvel|2017|loc=269–270}}

A fourth objection holds that Dolezal is engaged in a "wrongful exercise of white privilege". This argument holds that a white person can restore their [[white privilege]] whenever they need it; a black person is denied this ease of movement.{{sfnp|Tuvel|2017|loc=270}} Tuvel quotes the writer Tamara Winfrey Harris: "I will accept Ms. Dolezal as black like me only when society can accept me as white like her."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Tuvel|2017|loc=270}}; Harris, Tamara Winfrey (16 June 2015). [https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/16/opinion/rachel-dolezals-harmful-masquerade.html "Black Like Who? Rachel Dolezal’s Harmful Masquerade"], ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; Tuvel writes that the same argument applies to trans women, especially before surgery; that someone could return to [[male privilege]] should not preclude their transition. She argues further than the exercise of privilege is a separate issue. That more men than women get jobs as philosophy professors does not mean we should get rid of philosophy professors; instead, we should address the inequality. Similarly, if society comes to accept transracialism, it could be made easier for all races to transition. Tuvel adds that it is hard to see how Dolezal could be accused of exercising white privilege by choosing to give it up.{{sfnp|Tuvel|2017|loc=270–271}}

Finally, Tuvel asks whether, if we accept her position, we are obliged to accept any and all self-identification, such as individuals who [[Otherkin|identify as nonhuman]]. She repeats that two components are necessary for a successful change: self-identification and social acceptance of the new identity. It is reasonable to ask that social acceptance depend on it being possible for individuals to imagine what it is like to exist and be treated as a member of the category they seek to join. Without that, there is "too little commonality to make the group designation meaningful".{{sfnp|Tuvel|2017|loc=272}}

Botts was unable to attend, but she submitted a couple of paragraphs in reply to Tuvel and the panel members, arguing that the contemporary understanding of race in the United States in the 21st century is that it is an "identity marker based in ancestry", which unlike gender is not changeable; she called race "externally derived" and gender "internally derived".

===Criticism===
On Friday, 28 April 2017, Tuvel and the article came under attack on Facebook and Twitter. Tuvel was called transphobic, racist, crazy and stupid, and was accused of having engaged in "epistemic violence".&lt;ref name=Oliver7May2017&gt;[[Kelly Oliver|Oliver, Kelly]] (7 May 2017).

Alton Jones Professor of Philosophy at Vanderbilt University, who chaired Tuvel's [[dissertation committee]] in 2014,&lt;ref name=PhDcommittee/&gt; made an effort on Facebook to defend Tuvel by asking for arguments rather than insults, and suggested that ''Hypatia'' invite critical responses. She was told her comments were "unforgivable", and that her suggestions were "doing violence" and triggering [[PTSD]].&lt;ref name=Oliver7May2017/&gt;

According to Oliver, several people associated with ''Hypatia'' joined in the criticism and apologized individually for the article. A friend of Oliver's described one of the Facebook apologies as "like something ISIS makes its captors read in a hostage video before beheading them". Dissenters were shut down or afraid to speak up. Several people who wrote sympathetically to Tuvel in private attacked her in public. Others who posted criticism acknowledged privately that they had not read the article.  A "senior feminist philosopher" telephoned Tuvel to remind her that she had to appeal to the "right people" to get tenure. Oliver writes: "Through every medium imaginable, senior feminist scholars were pressuring, even ''threatening'', Tuvel that she wouldn't get tenure and her career would be ruined if she didn’t retract her article."&lt;ref name=Oliver7May2017/&gt; Tuvel said that people were "absolutely vicious" toward her.&lt;ref name=Sosis/&gt;

The paper's references to surgery, Berenstain wrote, objectified trans bodies, and its reference to "a male-to-female (mtf) trans individual who could return to male privilege" promoted "the harmful transmisogynistic ideology that trans women have (at some point had) male privilege".&lt;ref name=Singal2May2017/&gt;

{{quote|1.  It uses vocabulary and frameworks not recognized, accepted, or adopted by the conventions of the relevant subfields; for example, the author uses the language of “transgenderism” and engages in [[deadnaming]] a trans woman;

2.  It mischaracterizes various theories and practices relating to religious identity and conversion; for example, the author gives an off-hand example about conversion to Judaism;

3.  It misrepresents leading accounts of belonging to a racial group; for example, the author incorrectly cites [[Charles W. Mills|Charles Mills]] as a defender of voluntary racial identification;

4.  It fails to seek out and sufficiently engage with scholarly work by those who are most vulnerable to the intersection of racial and gender oppressions (women of color) in its discussion of “transracialism”. We endorse Hypatia's stated commitment to "actively reflect and engage the diversity within feminism, the diverse experiences and situations of women, and the diverse forms that gender takes around the globe," and we find that this submission was published without being held to that commitment.&lt;ref name=letter&gt;"Open letter to Hypatia", Google Docs.

====Rebuttal====
{{Feminism sidebar}}
According to Justin Weinberg, [[associate professor]] of philosophy at the [[University of South Carolina]], and Jesse Singal of ''New York'' magazine, most of the letter's claims were false or arguable.&lt;ref name=Singal2May2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=Weinberg1May2017/&gt; Regarding the term ''transgenderism'', [[GLAAD]] does caution against its use. The [[deadnaming]] consisted of Tuvel including Jenner's previous name in parentheses, a name that Jenner herself refers to, Singal wrote.&lt;ref name=Singal2May2017/&gt;{{efn|[[Caitlyn Jenner]] (2017): "Transgender guidelines suggest that I no longer be referred to as Bruce in any circumstance. Here are my guidelines: I will refer to the name Bruce when I think it appropriate and the name Caitlyn when I think it appropriate. Bruce existed for sixty-five years, and Caitlyn is just going on her second birthday. That's the reality."&lt;ref&gt;Jenner, Caitlyn (2017). ''The Secrets of My Life''. New York: Grand Central Publishing, vii.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Weinberg argued that it was unclear why the conversion example was deemed objectionable; it consisted of a paragraph explaining that, barring (for example) objections from the rabbi that the prospective convert is not committed to Judaism, those who wish to become Jews can do so.&lt;ref name=Weinberg1May2017/&gt;{{sfnp|Tuvel|2017|loc=264}} Weinberg also argued that Tuvel had not identified Charles Mills as a "defender of voluntary racial identification"; he wrote that this allegation was "just plain false".&lt;ref name=Weinberg1May2017/&gt;{{efn|Tuvel (2017): "Charles Mills identifies at least five categories generally relevant to the determination of racial membership, including 'self-awareness of ancestry, public awareness of ancestry, culture, experience, and self-identification' (Mills 1998, 50). If ancestry is a less emphasized feature in some places (for example, in Brazil), then Dolezal's exposure to black culture, experience living as someone read as black, and her self-identification could be sufficient to deem she is black in those places. And because there is no fact of the matter about her 'actual' race from a genetic standpoint, these features of Dolezal's experience would be decisive for determining her race in that particular context. The crucial point here is that no 'truth' about Dolezal's 'real' race would be violated."{{sfnp|Tuvel|2017|loc=268}}}}

The criticism that Tuvel had not cited enough women of color may be a fair point, according to Singal, but hardly sufficient to demand a retraction.&lt;ref name=Singal2May2017/&gt; Weinberg argued that Tuvel's critics had failed to point out a particular work that was both directly relevant and that had been omitted.&lt;ref name=Weinberg1May2017&gt;Justin Weinberg (1 May 2017).

&lt;blockquote&gt;To compare ethically the lived experience of trans people (from a distinctly external perspective) primarily to a single example of a white person claiming to have adopted a black identity creates an equivalency that fails to recognize the history of racial appropriation, while also associating trans people with racial appropriation. We recognize and mourn that these harms will disproportionately fall upon those members of our community who continue to experience marginalization and discrimination due to racism and cisnormativity.&lt;ref name=Singal2May2017/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It continued that "clearly, the article should not have been published", and blamed the review process, which had exposed Tuvel to criticism that was "both predictable and justifiable". The associate editors had been asked but declined to name the anonymous reviewers.&lt;ref name=Singal2May2017/&gt;

==Reception==
===Author's statement===
Tuvel issued a statement, on 1 May 2017, in response to the associate editors' apology:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I wrote this piece from a place of support for those with non-normative identities, and frustration about the ways individuals who inhabit them are so often excoriated, body-shamed, and silenced. When the case of Rachel Dolezal surfaced, I perceived a transphobic logic that lay at the heart of the constant attacks against her. My article is an effort to extend our thinking alongside transgender theories to other non-normative possibilities.&lt;ref name=Weinberg1May2017/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Citing scholars who have adopted sympathetic positions on transracialism, including [[Adolph L. Reed Jr.]] and [[Melissa Harris-Perry]], she argued that failing to examine the issues would "reinforce gender and racial essentialism". She apologized for the parenthetical reference to Jenner's previous name,&lt;ref name=Weinberg1May2017/&gt; which was removed from the article at her request on 4&amp;nbsp;May.{{sfnp|Tuvel|2017}} She also acknowledged that "[a] valid reproach is that my article discusses the lives of vulnerable people without sufficiently citing their own first-person experiences and views." Expressing concern about the personal attacks and hate mail she had received, including from commentators who had not read the article, she wrote that commentators had warned her that failing to retract the article would "be devastating for&amp;nbsp;... [her] personally, professionally, and morally". She argued that "critical thought is in danger", and that "the last place one expects to find such calls for censorship rather than discussion is amongst philosophers".&lt;ref name=Weinberg1May2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=McKenzie1May2017&gt;McKenzie, Lindsay (1 May 2017).

===Early response from ''Hypatia''===
[[Sally Scholz]], the journal's editor-in-chief, offered her support to Tuvel on 6 May, writing that "it is utterly inappropriate for editors to repudiate an article they have accepted for publication (barring issues of plagiarism or falsification of data)." The board of associate editors was a policy board with no role in the journal's management, she wrote, and it had acted independently in drafting and posting the letter.{{efn|[[Sally Scholz|Sally J. Scholz]] (6 May 2017): "As Editor of an academic journal that espouses pluralism and diversity, I believe that Hypatia should publish on a wide array of topics employing a wide array of methodologies. I believe that a community of scholars should contest concepts and engage in dialogue within the pages of the journal to advance our collective project of educating—students and ourselves. I believe that an academic journal is not a blog or a discussion board.{{pb}}"I firmly believe, and this belief will not waver, that it is utterly inappropriate for editors to repudiate an article they have accepted for publication (barring issues of plagiarism or falsification of data). In this respect, editors must stand behind the authors of accepted papers. That is where I stand. Professor Tuvel's paper went through the peer review process and was accepted by the reviewers and by me.{{pb}} "The Associate Editorial board acted independently in drafting and posting their statement. That board is a policy board and plays no role in the day to day management of the Journal.{{pb}} "Since April 30, I have been working with the publisher, Wiley, to respond responsibly and appropriately. We have consulted with the corporation which owns ''Hypatia'' and, together, we are proceeding to refer the situation to Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) for guidance."&lt;ref name=McKenzie6May2017/&gt;}} Scholz's position was supported by [[Miriam Solomon]], president of Hypatia Inc.'s board of directors. Scholz, the board and the publisher, John Wiley &amp; Sons, referred the matter to the [[Committee on Publication Ethics]].&lt;ref name=McKenzie6May2017/&gt;

On 18 May the board issued a statement with a mixed message.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Charlotte (18 May 2017). [http://www.weeklystandard.com/finally-a-meek-and-halfhearted-defense-of-rebecca-tuvel-from-hypatia/article/2008107 "Finally, a (Meek and Halfhearted) Defense of Rebecca Tuvel from Hypatia"], ''The Weekly Standard''.&lt;/ref&gt; Signed by [[Elizabeth S. Anderson|Elizabeth Anderson]], [[Leslie Francis]] (treasurer), Heidi Grasswick (secretary), Solomon (president), and [[Lisa Tessman]] (chair), it acknowledged the "intensity of experience and convictions around matters of intersectionality", and the "egregious history of treatment of women of color feminists and feminists from other marginalized social positions" within academic philosophy. Dismissing the view that objections to the article were too minor to have triggered such a strong response, the board wrote that such a view from "outsiders" reflects "ignorance of the cumulative history of marginalization, disrespect, and misrepresentation of oppressed groups".&lt;ref&gt;McKenzie, Lindsay (18 May 2017). [http://www.chronicle.com/article/Journal-s-Board-Disavows/240116 "Journal's Board Disavows Apology for 'Transracialism' Article, Making Retraction Unlikely"], ''The Chronicle of Higher Education''.&lt;/ref&gt; The statement continued that the associate editors had apologized without adequate consultation with the editor-in-chief and on their own behalf only. Condemning the personal attacks on Tuvel, the directors said they stood behind the editor-in-chief and that the article would not be retracted "barring discovery of misconduct or plagiarism". The associate editors' apology remained on ''Hypatia''{{'}}s Facebook page; on 25 May 2017 it was updated to say that it did not represent the views of the editor or board of directors.&lt;ref name=Anderson18May2017/&gt;

===Early academic reaction===
The academic community came out in support of Tuvel, particularly on two popular philosophy blogs, Justin Weinberg's ''[[Daily Nous]]'' and [[Brian Leiter]]'s ''Leiter Reports''.&lt;ref name=Weinberg1May2017/&gt; Leiter wrote that he had "never seen anything like this in academic philosophy".&lt;ref name=Singal2May2017/&gt; Mark Newman, chair of the [[Rhodes College]] philosophy department where Tuvel teaches, expressed the department's "complete and unconditional support" for her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Leiter |first1=Brian |author-link=Brian Leiter|title=Philosophy Department at Rhodes College speaks out in support of Prof. Tuvel |url=http://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2017/05/philosophy-department-at-rhodes-college-speaks-out-in-support-of-prof-tuvel.html |website=Leiter Reports |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180725134940/http://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2017/05/philosophy-department-at-rhodes-college-speaks-out-in-support-of-prof-tuvel.html |archivedate=25 July 2018 |date=4 May 2017|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of harm had been "twisted beyond all recognition" by the associate editors' letter, according to José Luis Bermúdez, professor of philosophy at [[Texas A&amp;M University]].&lt;ref&gt;Bermúdez, José Luis (5 May 2017). [https://www.insidehighered.com/views/2017/05/05/real-damage-done-flare-over-philosophers-journal-article-essay "Defining 'Harm' in the Tuvel Affair"], ''Inside Higher Ed''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Bloom (psychologist)|Paul Bloom]] called the episode "a bizarre and ugly attack".&lt;ref name=Singal2May2017/&gt; Several commentators blamed social media's [[call-out culture]] for the speed with which the dispute unfolded.&lt;ref name=McKenzie6May2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=Oliver7May2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=Walters5May2017/&gt; In the view of [[Suzanna Danuta Walters]], editor-in-chief of the feminist journal ''[[Signs (journal)|Signs]]'', the associate editors had undermined "the whole process of peer review and the principles of scholarly debate".&lt;ref name=Walters5May2017/&gt; Dan Kaufman, professor of philosophy at [[Missouri State University]], blamed the profession's "increasing obsession with identity politics" and "purity-purges".&lt;ref&gt;Sosis, Cliff (25 January 2018). [http://www.whatisitliketobeaphilosopher.com/#/dan-kaufman/ "Interview with Dan Kaufman"], ''What Is It Like to Be a Philosopher?''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rogers Brubaker]], author of ''Trans: Gender and Race in an Age of Unsettled Identities'' (2016), described as "epistemological insiderism" the idea that certain issues can be covered only by particular categories of scholar, and that as a white cisgender woman Tuvel had no standing to argue about transgender or transracial issues. For Brubaker, acknowledging himself as a white cisgender man, this position means not only that certain topics are too easily closed off to particular scholars, but that scholars with [[lived experience]] are expected to focus on those topics.&lt;ref name=Brubaker18May2017/&gt;

[[File:Sally Haslanger, May 2013 (cropped).jpeg|thumb|left|upright|[[Sally Haslanger]]]]
Systemic [[sexism]] within the discipline was cited. There had been tension for some time between ''Hypatia'' and women-of-color philosophers, who believed the journal did not take their work seriously, according to [[Tina Fernandes Botts]]. Botts was critical of the ''Hypatia'' peer-review process that had allowed the paper to be published. "What you do when someone submits the paper is you find people who are experts in that area to review it," she told ''The Chronicle of Higher Education'', "to make sure that it is situated within contemporary scholarly discussions. Obviously they didn’t do that."&lt;ref name=McKenzie6May2017/&gt;

[[Sally Haslanger]], later appointed co-chair of ''Hypatia''{{'s}} governance task force, complained about poor working conditions and the narrow focus of philosophy journals; she wrote that there are days she can "hardly stand the arrogance, the ignorance, the complacency, in short, the bullshit, of the profession". The situation was not Tuvel's fault; she had been unfairly targeted, in Haslanger's view. Of 13,000 professional philosophers in the United States in 2013, she wrote, only 55 were black women and 30 percent of those were PhD students.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sally Haslanger|Haslanger, Sally]] (4 May 2017).

[http://www.chronicle.com/article/Why-Tuvel-s-Article-So/240029 "Why Tuvel’s Article So Troubled Its Critics"], ''The Chronicle of Higher Education''.&lt;/ref&gt; Oliver Traldi argued in ''[[Quillette]]'' that the dispute was partly attributable to the influence of [[Continental philosophy|continental]] as opposed to [[Analytic philosophy|analytic]] philosophy, and the idea that philosophy should be a vehicle for social change, rather than an impartial search for truth.&lt;ref&gt;Traldi, Oliver (9 May 2017). [http://quillette.com/2017/05/09/line-sand-academic-philosophy/ "A Line in the Sand for Academic Philosophy"], ''[[Quillette]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Hypatia'' resignations and task force===
The Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) reported in July 2017 that the associate editors' apology had been inappropriate, and that, when responding to an external complaint about a journal article, an internal inquiry should be held prior to a public response. The associate editors apparently refused to accept the report's conclusions.&lt;ref name=Zamudio-Suaréz21July2017/&gt; On 20 July ''Hypatia'' announced the resignation of Scholz, the editor-in-chief, and Shelley Wilcox, editor of Hypatia Reviews Online. They also announced that a task force would restructure the journal's governance, and that anyone holding an editorial or non-board position with ''Hypatia'' would be "required to sign a statement of adherence" to COPE guidelines.&lt;ref name=Weinberg21July2017&gt;{{cite news |last1=Weinberg |first1=Justin |title=Hypatia’s Editor and Reviews Editor Resign; Authority of Associate Editors 'Temporarily Suspended' |url=http://dailynous.com/2017/07/21/hypatias-editor-reviews-editor-resign-authority-associate-editors-temporarily-suspended/ |work=Daily Nous |date=21 July 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180726135550/http://dailynous.com/2017/07/21/hypatias-editor-reviews-editor-resign-authority-associate-editors-temporarily-suspended/ |archivedate=26 July 2018|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=resignation&gt;{{cite web |title=Board of Directors' Statement (July 20, 2017) |url=http://hypatiaphilosophy.org/statements/board-directors-statement-july-20-2017/ |website=Hypatia |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180724105806/http://hypatiaphilosophy.org/statements/board-directors-statement-july-20-2017/ |date=20 July 2017|archivedate=24 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=interim&gt;{{cite web|title=Continuation of Interim Editorial Team|url=http://www.hypatiaphilosophy.org/Editorial/index.html|publisher=Hypatia News|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201043838/http://www.hypatiaphilosophy.org/Editorial/index.html|date=20 July 2017|archivedate=1 December 2017|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Weinberg3Aug2017&gt;{{cite news|last1=Weinberg|first1=Justin|title=Further Developments at Hypatia|url=http://dailynous.com/2017/08/03/further-developments-at-hypatia/|work=Daily Nous|date=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a statement from the associate editors, the board asked them, on 17 July, to resign or it would suspend the journal's governance documents, thereby removing the associate editors' authority to choose the next editor. Eight of the associate editors resigned. In a resignation letter, they argued that feminist philosophy had an ethical commitment to transform philosophy into "a discipline that honors the perspectives and welcomes the scholarly contributions of historically marginalized groups, including people of color, trans* people, disabled people, and queer people".&lt;ref name=Weinberg24July2017&gt;{{cite news|last1=Weinberg|first1=Justin|title=Hypatia's Associate Editors Resign|url=http://dailynous.com/2017/07/24/hypatias-associate-editors-resign/|work=Daily Nous|date=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Flaherty|first1=Colleen|title=(Another) Shake-Up at 'Hypatia'|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/07/24/divisions-within-hypatias-editorial-board-lead-resignations-top-editors|work=Inside Higher Ed|date=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Zamudio-Suaréz21July2017&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zamudio-Suaréz|first1=Fernanda|title=Months After 'Transracialism' Flap, Controversy Still Rages at Feminist Philosophy Journal|url=http://www.chronicle.com/article/Months-After/240722|work=The Chronicle of Higher Education|date=21 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sally Haslanger]], [[Serene Khader]] and Yannik Thiem were named as co-chairs of the governance task force, and [[Ann Garry]], Serene Khader, and [[Alison Stone]] were appointed as interim editors.&lt;ref name=interim/&gt; In February 2018 the five-person board of directors was replaced.&lt;ref name=search23Feb2018/&gt; [[Linda Martín Alcoff]] and Kim Hall, two of the associate editors who resigned in July,&lt;ref name=Weinberg24July2017/&gt; became, respectively, president of the board of directors and chair of the search committee for the new editorial team.&lt;ref name=search23Feb2018&gt;{{cite web|title=Announcement from Hypatia's Board of Directors and Task Force Co-Chairs|url=http://hypatiaphilosophy.org/announcements/announcement-hypatias-board-directors-task-force-co-chairs/|publisher=''Hypatia''|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180301164503/http://hypatiaphilosophy.org/announcements/announcement-hypatias-board-directors-task-force-co-chairs/|archivedate=1 March 2018|date=23 February 2018|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2018 symposium, Mellon Foundation grant===
[[Peg Birmingham]], editor of ''[[Philosophy Today]]'', published a symposium on Tuvel's article in the journal's Winter 2018 edition, with contributions from Chloë Taylor (Alberta), [[Lewis Gordon]] ([[University of Connecticut|UConn]]), Kris Sealey ([[Fairfield University|Fairfield]]), Sabrina Hom ([[Georgia College &amp; State University|GCSU]]), Tina Fernandes Botts and Rebecca Tuvel.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pdcnet.org/collection-anonymous/browse?fp=philtoday&amp;fq=philtoday%2fVolume%2f8938%7c62%2f8999%7cIssue%3a+1%2f "Special symposium: Rebecca Tuvel and her interlocutors"], ''Philosophy Today''. 62(1), Winter 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2018 the [[Andrew W.

The '''International Hot-Air Balloon Festival in Château-d'Oex''' is a [[hot-air balloon]]s festival that has taken place every year during nine days at the end of January in [[Château-d'Œx]], [[Switzerland]] since 1979.&lt;ref&gt;chateau-doex.ch, [http://www.chateau-doex.ch/en/Manifestations/topevent/festivalinternationaldeballon International Hot-Air Balloon Festival in Château-d’Oex] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807120116/http://www.chateau-doex.ch/en/Manifestations/topevent/festivalinternationaldeballon |date=2011-08-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ch/books?id=j7bcqQEMsV8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=fr#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Frommer's 500 Adrenaline Adventures, 10 Hot-Air Balloon Rides to Lift Your Spirits]&lt;/ref&gt; It is attended by nearly a hundred balloons from over twenty countries. It is famous for taking place in a snowy valley (most of the time) and also for a unique event : the "night-glow" show, where all the balloons are exposed on the mountain, lit by their burners, during the evening of the 7th day.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11910">[[File:Inaugural invitation 2009.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Photograph of the invitation to Barack Obama's inauguration]]
One million '''invitations to Barack Obama's inauguration''' were sent out in the first week of January 2009. Printed between December 11, 2008, and January 2, 2009, the invitations invited people to celebrate [[Barack Obama]]'s [[First inauguration of Barack Obama|inauguration]] as the [[List of Presidents of the United States|forty-fourth]] [[President of the United States]]. The invitations have kept the same basic design of a gold seal and black script since the 1949 inauguration of [[Harry S. Truman]], but this invitation was produced in a [[Environmentally friendly|green]] manner, using recycled paper, by companies certified by the [[Forest Stewardship Council]] (FSC).

==Preparations==
===Design===
The invitations have followed the same design since those for [[Harry S. Truman]]'s [[Harry S. Truman 1949 presidential inauguration|presidential inauguration]] on January 20, 1949.&lt;ref name="SI"&gt;{{cite news |first=Stephannia |last=Cleaton |title=Staten Island firm to send out Obama's invitations |url=http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2009/01/staten_island_firm_to_send_out.html |work=[[Staten Island Advance]] |date=January 1, 2009 |accessdate=January 21, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ABC"&gt;{{cite news |first=David |last=Muir |title=Printer Crafts 1 Million Inaugural Invitations |url=http://abcnews.go.com/WN/Inauguration/story?id=6551979&amp;page=1 |format=video |publisher=[[World News with Charles Gibson|ABC World News with Charles Gibson]] |date=December 30, 2009 |accessdate=January 21, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The invitations have a gold embossed inauguration seal at the top of the page and black-inked script using customized Shelley Alegro and Kuenstler typefaces.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news |first=Caroline |last=Dworin |title=Inside a Gritty Brooklyn Factory, Potomac Fever |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/21/nyregion/thecity/21prin.html?_r=1&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink |work=[[New York Times]] |page=CY5 |date=December 21, 2008 |accessdate=January 21, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The invitation reads, "The [[Presidential Inaugural Committee]] requests the honor of your presence to attend and participate in the Inauguration of Barack H. Obama as President of the United States of America and Joseph R. Biden Jr. as Vice President of the United States of America on Tuesday, the twentieth of January two thousand and nine in the city of Washington."&lt;ref name="SI" /&gt;

===Printing===
[[File:Reverse of seal of Obama inauguration invitation.jpg|right|thumb|150px|The reverse of the seal of Obama's inauguration invitation]]
Ink for the invitations was supplied by [[Chicago]] company BuzzInk,&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; and the [[Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies]] selected Precise Continental of [[Brooklyn, New York]] to print the invitations.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; Precise Continental was selected because it is a [[trade union|union company]], uses recycled paper, and is [[Forest Stewardship Council]] certified.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; The printing technique for the invitations was [[engraving]]. The design was cut into the surface of a copper plate, which was then inked and inserted into a printing press with a sheet of paper. The result is a slightly raised impression on the front of the page and a slightly indented impression on the bottom.&lt;ref name="HOW"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.howdesign.com/article/inaugurationinvitation/ |title=1M Inaugural Invites for Obama Stirs the Ink at Printer |accessdate=January 21, 2009 |last=Kuhn |first=Jessica |date=January 16, 2009 |work=[[HOW (magazine)|HOW]] |publisher=[[F+W Media Inc.|F+W Media]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first plate had to be scrapped because it was engraved without the President's middle initial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Obama Inauguration: Local Company Printing Invitations |url=http://www.myfoxny.com/myfox/pages/News/Detail?contentId=8204279&amp;version=1&amp;locale=EN-US&amp;layoutCode=VSTY&amp;pageId=3.2.1 |publisher=[[WNYW]] |format=video |location= |id= |pages= |page= |date= |accessdate=21 January 2009 |language= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The golden seal was engraved in three printing runs. The first print laid down a rough-textured basic gold shape. The second run added smoothness and shine, and the final print run added the fine details to the seal.&lt;ref name="HOW" /&gt; One million invitations were printed over 20 hours every day between December 11, 2008, and January 2, 2009, with employees working in two shifts and taking breaks only on Christmas Day and New Year's Day.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HOW" /&gt; The invitations were printed one at a time on 11×17 sheets of paper, which were then cut in half to 8½×11 sheets.&lt;ref name="ABC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HOW" /&gt;

===Paper===
The paper used to print the invitations on initially came from [[Michigan]]. Waste paper collected from local companies in [[Grand Rapids]] was collected by [http://www.padnos.com/ Louis Padnos Iron &amp; Metal]. It was shipped to Wisconsin, where it was turned into [[Pulp (paper)|pulp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=West Michigan scraps part of inaugural invitations |url=http://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2009/01/west_michigan_scraps_part_of_i.html |work=[[Grand Rapids Press]] |date=January 20, 2009 |accessdate=January 21, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Whiting Paper Mill, owned by Neenah Paper, another FSC certified company, converted the pulp into ''CLASSIC CREST Recycled 100 Natural White Papers manufactured by Neenah Paper'', which contains FSC certified fibers and is made with 100 percent renewable green energy in a completely carbon-neutral, chlorine-free process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neenahpaper.com/CLASSICCRESTColorChart/index.asp?ft=Home |title=Classic Crest Color Chart |accessdate=January 21, 2009 |publisher=[[Neeneh Papers]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081222013843/http://www.neenahpaper.com/CLASSICCRESTcolorChart/index.asp?ft=Home |archivedate=December 22, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper was delivered to Precise by [[Central National-Gottesman]], another FSC certified company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Obama team chooses FSC-certified paper for inaugural invitations |publisher=[[Forest Stewardship Council]] |url=http://www.fscus.org/news/?article=533 |accessdate=January 21, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mailing===
Prompt Mailers of [[Staten Island, New York]] mailed the invitations, which also included a letter from the Presidential Inaugural Committee and a leaflet from the inaugural store. Between December 31, 2008, and January 7, 2009, 3,100 to 3,500 envelopes were filled and sealed every hour.&lt;ref name="SI" /&gt;

==Recipients==

Invitations were sent to the chiefs of diplomatic missions to the United States and their spouses but not to any other representatives of foreign countries. As a result, [[North Korea]]'s offer to send a senior envoy was rejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=N Korea "sought Obama invite" |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia-pacific/2009/01/20091135623421404.html |publisher=Al Jazeera |date=2009-01-13 |accessdate=2009-01-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090121101135/http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia-pacific/2009/01/20091135623421404.html |archivedate=2009-01-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tuskegee Airmen]] were among the invited guests for the inauguration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/10/us/politics/10inaug.html|title=Inauguration Is a Culmination for Black Airmen |accessdate=2008-12-19|date=2008-12-09|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=Seelye, Katharine Q.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The five-person crew of [[US Airways Flight 1549]], including pilot [[Chesley Sullenberger]], were also invited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Katharine Q. |last=Seelye |title=Obama Invites Flight 1549 Pilot and Crew to Inauguration |url=http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/01/19/obama-invites-flight-1549-pilot-and-crew-to-inauguration/?hp |publisher=The New York Times |date=2009-01-19 |accessdate=2009-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Entertainment industry figures such as [[Beyoncé]], [[Jay-Z]], [[Steven Spielberg]], [[Magic Johnson]], [[Dustin Hoffman]], [[Muhammad Ali]], [[John Cusack]], and [[Oprah Winfrey]] received invitations,&lt;ref name="Insider"&gt;{{cite news |title=Celeb Sightings at the Inauguration |url=http://www.theinsider.com/news/1560108_Celeb_Sightings_at_the_Inauguration?ttag=cbsnti&amp;imageHeight=52&amp;imageWidth=52 |work=[[The Insider (TV series)|The Insider]] |date=January 20, 2009 |accessdate=January 21, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Barack Assumes Presidency as the World Watches |url=http://www.etonline.com/news/2009/01/69866/index.html |work=[[Entertainment Tonight]] |date=January 20, 2009 |accessdate=January 21, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124043759/http://www.etonline.com/news/2009/01/69866/index.html |archivedate=January 24, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as politicians such as [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], Governor of California; Massachusetts Senator [[Ted Kennedy]]; and Arizona Senator [[John McCain]].&lt;ref name="Insider" /&gt; The invitiation to Evangelical pastor [[Rick Warren]] drew some criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Warren defends invite by Obama |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2008/dec/22/warren-defends-invite-by-obama/ |agency=[[Associated Press]] |work=[[Washington Times]] |date=December 22, 2008 |accessdate=January 21, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the general public also received invitations to the inaugural ceremony.

'''Marktrock''' is a music festival held each year around 15 August, in the heart of the university town of [[Leuven]], Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marktrock.com&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a smaller Marktrock festival in [[Poperinge]] which is held the last Saturday of August.

The name Marktrock comes from the Dutch word {{lang|nl|markt}}, meaning market and it is held on 2 squares (4 until 24th edition) in the historical city center of Leuven: "Oude Markt" and "Ladeuzeplein". Until the 24th edition (2006) the three-day festival always had 15 August [[Assumption Day]] as its last day.

In 2004, the 22nd edition of the Marktrock festival was held in Leuven and it has grown into one of Europe's biggest urban music festivals with over 350,000 visitors each year.

On 5 February 2007 the Marktrock vzw organization announced the end of the festival. Main reasons were the raising price of quality artists and groups, the low capacity of the main stage on the "Oude Markt", the new and expensive legal regulations each year, the financial risk of open-air festivals and the organization refused to raise entry tickets for the "Oude Markt" stage again. The rain during the 2006 edition certainly didn't help either. Over the 24 years history of the original MarktRock more than 1400 artists performed at Marktrock, more than 5 million people visited the festival and it launched several Belgian artists.

In March 2007 Marktrock came under new management, which revived the festival and redesigned the 2007 edition. The free stages disappeared, replaced by two paying stages: the Oude Markt focused on local and upcoming bands, while the larger Ladeuzeplein featured established and international artists. This new setup met with significant criticism and attendance was low.

For the 2008 edition, the festival was once again revamped, bringing back the various free stages throughout the city, leaving only the Oude Markt with an entry fee. The festival still struggled to draw the crowds it used to draw.

The 2009 festival changed its approach once more, ditching both the entry fee and international acts. It secured additional funding from the city of Leuven on the condition that the festival would focus on local talent. Despite a line-up of mostly obscure bands, this edition drew an estimated 95,000 visitors, causing minor organisational problems as visitors were turned back from venues that were filled to capacity.

The '''Memorable Order of Tin Hats''' ('''M.O.T.H.''') was founded in 1927 by [[Charles Evenden]] as a brotherhood of [[South African]] former front-line soldiers. The ideal is to help fellow comrades in need, either financially or physically; and to remember all servicemen who have answered the ''Sunset Call'', both in war and peace time.&lt;ref name="M.O.T.H."&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moth.org.za/about-us/|title=Memorable Order of Tin Hats – About Us|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;SESA 1974, pp. 327–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation==
[[File:MOTH Shellhole.JPG|thumb|left|200px|M.O.T.H. Shellhole, [[Bloemfontein]].]]
According to the ''Dictionary of South African Biography'', one night in 1927 after he and the editor of ''The Natal Mercury'', RJ Kingston Russell, had seen a war film, [[Charles Evenden]] was persuaded to draw a cartoon on 'remembrance'. According to the Dictionary, "The cartoon showed a tin helmet surmounted by a burning candle. Around the flames of the candle were six words – ''True Comradeship'' – ''Mutual Help'' – ''Sound Memory''".&lt;ref name="DSAB 1987, pp. 250–51"&gt;DSAB 1987, pp. 250–51.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the official M.O.T.H. website carries a cartoon captioned ''Forgetfulness'' and this led to the founding of the Order. This is confirmed by the ''Eastern Province Herald'' which describes the cartoon as follows: "a bullet- and shrapnel-riddled Allied helmet awash in the ocean. In the background a steamship passes over the horizon, leaving the forgotten, ghostly form of a veteran forlornly wading through the water."

"The concepts of ''True Comradeship'', ''Mutual Help'' and ''Sound Memory'' were to become the inspiration of a remarkable organisation of ex-front line soldiers, of all ranks, known as M.O.T.H. Evenden, as the founder of the movement and its guiding inspiration was given the title of ''Moth O'' – a position he held until his death."&lt;ref name="DSAB 1987, pp. 250–51"/&gt;

The membership of the M.O.T.H. movement, under Evenden's vigorous direction and leadership, grew into thousands. Men and women of two world wars, of the [[Second Boer War|Second Anglo Boer War]] (1899–1902) and even those of former enemy forces streamed into its ranks. All who were prepared to keep alive the memories of comradeship and self-sacrifice – the finer virtues that war brings forth – were welcomed and made at home in shell holes as the meeting premises are called with colourful and meaningful names of war-time memories and occasions. M.O.T.H. shell holes have been opened in [[Malawi]], [[Namibia]], [[Zambia]], and [[Zimbabwe]]. Membership was extended to those who had participated in the [[South African Border War]].&lt;ref name="M.O.T.H."/&gt;

==Warrior's Gate M.O.T.H. Shrine, Durban==
The shrine, located in [[Durban]], is modelled on a [[Norman architecture|Norman]] design from a photograph given to Evenden by Admiral [[Edward Evans, 1st Baron Mountevans|Evans-of-the-Broke]].

==Memorials==
In 1948 Evenden opened Mount Memory, a monument to the missing and dead of the Second World War, in the foothills of the [[Drakensberg]] mountains.

The '''Mendelssohn on Mull Festival''' is an annual chamber music festival held at various venues on the Isles of [[Mull]] and [[Iona]] and the surrounding area, usually during the first week in July. In 2019, the festival dates will move to 1–7 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://soundwavesscio.org.uk/mendelssohn-on-mull-festival/ |title=Mendelssohn on Mull Festival 2018 brochure |accessdate=6 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==

The festival takes its name from a visit by the composer [[Felix Mendelssohn]] to Scotland in 1829. Although only twenty years old, Mendelssohn was already an established composer and conductor. The natural beauty of Scotland and its rich history of fact and fable delighted the young composer and inspired his [[Symphony No. 3 (Mendelssohn)|Symphony No. 3, ''Scottish'']].&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.mendelssohninscotland.com/journey-north "The Journey North"] in [http://www.mendelssohninscotland.com/ ''Mendelssohn in Scotland''] website, accessed 9 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mendelssohn stayed in [[Tobermory, Mull|Tobermory]] on [[Mull]] en route to [[Staffa]] where he visited [[Fingal's Cave]]. The concert overture known both as [[The Hebrides (overture)|''The Hebrides'']] and as ''Fingal's Cave'' was composed shortly after his visit, and was originally entitled 'The Lonely Island'. Mendelssohn sent a postcard to his family with the opening phrase of the overture written on it. In a note to his sister, [[Fanny Mendelssohn]] he said: "In order to make you understand how extraordinarily the Hebrides affected me, I send you the following, which came into my head there."&lt;ref name="OPO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orlandophil.org/downloads/program-notes/2006-07/opo-prog-notes-pac1.pdf |title=Orlando Philharmonic Orchestra Program Notes |accessdate=2006-11-08 |author=David R.

The festival that now bears his name was conceived as a musical pilgrimage in commemoration of Mendelssohn's visit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The festival was founded in 1988 by the violinist [[Leonard Friedman]], as a week of music-making, concentrating on string chamber music, where the participants were a blend of established professionals and students, at which audiences were welcome at no cost.&lt;ref name="scotsman-25"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/culture/music/mendelssohn-on-mull-festival-marks-25th-anniversary-1-2975253 | title=Mendelssohn on Mull: Festival marks 25th anniversary | newspaper=[[The Scotsman]] | date=25 June 2013 | accessdate=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Friedman's death in 1994, the festival has maintained this pattern with artistic direction being provided by [[Levon Chilingirian]]&lt;ref name=Guardian_2012&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2012/may/25/scotland-best-classical-music-festivals |author=Mark Porter |title=Scotland's best classical music festivals  |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=25 May 2012 |accessdate=6 July 2018 |}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2003–2016), and the [[Doric String Quartet]] (2018 to present).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://soundwavesscio.org.uk/mendelssohn-on-mull-festival/doric-string-quartet/ | title = Doric String Quartet at the Mendelssohn on Mull Festival | publisher = Mendelssohn on Mull Festival | accessdate = 17 March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The festival is administered by a trust which organises the events and pays the expenses of the participants and professionals. Since 2016 the festival has been administered by Sound Waves SCIO.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oscr.org.uk/search-oscr/charity-details?number=SC044935&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jennifer Ann Crecente''' (September 9, 1987 &amp;ndash; February 15, 2006), a victim of [[teen dating violence]], was an 18-year-old high school student who was shot and killed in southwest [[Austin, Texas]] by Justin Crabbe, an ex-boyfriend, on February 15, 2006. Crecente's murder was the first in Austin in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.texaspsyc.org/displaycommon.cfm?an=1&amp;subarticlenbr=73 Texas Psychological Association]&lt;/ref&gt; In response to her murder, two charitable organizations have been formed, a memorial grant created in her name, and legislation passed in Texas to prevent teen dating violence.

==Life==
Jennifer Ann Crecente was born in 1987 in Las Cruces. Her family moved to Austin, where she attended local schools, including high school. Among her classmates at [[Bowie High School (Austin, Texas)|Bowie High School]] in Austin was Justin Crabbe, until he dropped out of school in the tenth grade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kxan.com/Global/story.asp?S=4527453 "Crecente Murder Investigation Continues"], KXAN, Feb 20, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Jennifer was a camp counselor at [[SciTrek]] in [[Atlanta]] and hospital volunteer in Austin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elpasotimes.com/breakingnews/ci_6415655|title=Dating violence bill hopes to educate students|work=El Paso Times.com|accessdate=29 December 2014}}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her grandmother was a psychologist and it was a field Jennifer was considering for study.

She and Crabbe dated for a period but she had ended their relationship.

Both parents have founded organizations in Jennifer's honor. Organizational goals for the two organizations sometimes converge but work as individual entities:

[[Jennifer Ann's Group]], a [[501(c)(3)]] [[non-profit]] organization, was created by Jennifer's father Drew  in February 2006 in Crecente's memory to prevent [[teen dating violence]]. The stated purpose of the organization is to "keep Jennifer Crecente's memory alive through education and good works." The organization distributes educational materials to schools and organizations across the US for free and has speakers for national and regional events to talk about teen dating violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://JenniferAnn.org|title=Jennifer Ann's Group :: #stopTDV|publisher=|accessdate=29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the creator of the [http://www.jenniferann.org/games.htm Life.Love.

Jennifer's Hope was founded in August 2006 by Jennifer's mother, Elizabeth Crecente. She speaks to teens and professionals, and has had several national appearances, multiple statewide appearances, and is involved in the Austin/Travis county community drives to prevent teen dating violence and promote healthy relationships.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jennifershope.org Jennifer's Hope]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legislation ==
On February 5, 2007, the Texas Legislature's State Representative Dawnna Dukes entered a bill to require school districts in Texas to create policies regarding [[Teen Dating Violence]].

== Dedications ==
The [[Colquitt County]] Arts Center Theatre dedicated the 2007 production of ''[[Oliver!]]'' to Jennifer Ann Crecente. In 1998 the Arts Center had performed ''Oliver!'', and Jennifer and her father had both appeared in the production. The 2007 production is dedicated to Crecente because of her performance; in addition, the show includes a theme of [[dating violence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.moultrieobserver.com/local/local_story_202222934.html |title=''Moultrie Observer:'' Play dedicated to slain teen |access-date=2007-07-22 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120910172552/http://www.moultrieobserver.com/local/local_story_202222934.html |archive-date=2012-09-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''NIN''''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|НИН}}) is a weekly [[newsmagazine]] published in [[Belgrade]], [[Serbia]]. Its name is an [[acronym]] for '''''Nedeljne informativne novine''''' (Недељне информативне новине) which roughly translates into ''Weekly Informational Newspaper''.

Though a current events magazine in its essence, ''NIN'' also earned an esteemed reputation due to a long tradition of opening its pages to the best and the brightest within [[Serbia]]n, and previously [[SFR Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] society, whether in arts, sciences, or even sports. This reputation has recently somewhat been tarnished{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} as the magazine was forced into commercial competition with numerous political periodicals that sprung up in [[Serbia]] after the collapse of [[socialism]]. Since then, ''NIN'' has adopted a slightly more populist tone, though it is still highly regarded.

{{As of|2007}}, the magazine had 35 employees.

In July 2008, the magazine celebrated the release of its 3000th issue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politika.rs/rubrike/Drustvo/NIN-objavio-3000-broj.lt.html NIN objavio 3000. broj, ''Politika'', June 27, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; On March 13, 2009 it was announced that majority stake in the magazine was bought by Swiss media company [[Ringier AG]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blic.rs/drustvo.php?id=83328 NIN prodat kompaniji "Ringier", ''Blic'', March 13, 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090314235159/http://www.blic.rs/drustvo.php?id=83328 |date=March 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
''NIN'' was originally started in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Thomas|title=Serbia Under Milošević: Politics in the 1990s|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IDzmXEDJFX8C&amp;pg=PR15|accessdate=2 August 2015|date=January 1999|publisher=C. Hurst &amp; Co. Publishers|isbn=978-1-85065-367-7|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the late 1980s [[Slobodan Milošević]] and his followers converted major publications, including ''NIN'', into media outlets of [[Serbian nationalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard West|title=Tito and the Rise and Fall of Yugoslavia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J34leeCdXFQC&amp;pg=PT210|accessdate=24 April 2016|date=15 November 2012|publisher=Faber &amp; Faber|isbn=978-0-571-28110-7|page=210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2009 sale===
In 2007 ''NIN'' was preparing for [[privatization]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.b92.net/biz/vesti/srbija.php?yyyy=2007&amp;mm=07&amp;dd=27&amp;nav_id=256974 NIN na aukciji 29. septembra, B92, July 27, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; At that time the magazine's ownership structure was: 87% publicly owned (društveni kapital), 10% owned by [[Politika AD]], and 3% owned by the employees. A 60.9% stake (70% of the public stake) in the magazine was to be auctioned off on September 29, 2007 with starting price set at [[Serbian dinar|RSD]]13.2 million (~ [[euro|€]]170,000).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.b92.net/biz/vesti/srbija.php?yyyy=2007&amp;mm=08&amp;dd=28&amp;nav_id=261073 Više od deset kupaca za NIN, B92, August 28, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the auction as the method of privatization for the magazine was scrapped by the Serbian Privatization Agency due to employee demands and a new [[Tender offer|tender]] was set for sometime during spring 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blic.co.rs/ekonomija.php?id=27214 Tender za NIN do kraja marta, ''Blic'', January 18, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

The tender was actually opened on October 30, 2008 and it closed on December 19, 2008. On December 25, 2008, it was reported that companies [[Ringier AG]] and [[Novosti AD]] submitted competing offers for 61.48% stake in ''NIN'' (70% of the magazine's public stake, which is in turn 87% of the total stake).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rts.rs/page/stories/ci/story/124/%D0%94%D1%80%D1%83%D1%88%D1%82%D0%B2%D0%BE/35451/%D0%9F%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%B0%D1%98%D0%B0+%22%D0%9D%D0%98%D0%9D%22-%D0%B0.html Продаја "НИН"-а, RTS, December 26, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid March 2009, it was announced that Ringier AG bought the majority stake in ''NIN'' for RSD57.455 million (~ €810,000). Soon afterward the magazine's headquarters moved from Cetinjska Street to Kraljice Marije Street at the same location where ''[[Blic (newspaper)|Blic]]'' daily (Ringier's other major asset in Serbia) has its headquarters. Sometime in April 2009, longtime editor-in-chief Slobodan Reljić was let go and replaced with Srđan Radulović, up to that point an editor at ''Blic'' daily. The change was done quietly without any press releases.

In September 2009, an open letter written by the magazine's longtime journalists to Ringier AG chairman [[Michael Ringier]] surfaced in which they are criticizing some of the moves and changes since Ringier took over.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pravda.rs/dogadjaji/12185/novi-anonimusi-unishtavau-nin Нови анонимуси уништавају НИН.

==The ''NIN'' Literary Award==
In January every year, ''NIN''{{'}}s special jury vote on what they feel was the best novel released during the previous year and award it with ''[[NIN Prize|Ninova nagrada]]'' (Нинова награда, ''the NIN Prize''), which has over the years become one of the highest honours for contemporary Serbian authors. The award is also very relevant commercially as its recipients usually go on to become bestsellers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6422">The '''National Black Theatre Festival (NBTF)''' was founded in 1989 by [[Larry Leon Hamlin]] in [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina]]. Serving as its executive director, Hamlin’s goal in creating the Festival was "to unite black [[theatre]] companies in [[United States|America]] to ensure the survival of the genre into the next millennium".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nbtf.org/nbtf_history.html | title=National Black Theatre Festival History Page | publisher=National Black Theatre Festival | year=2007 | accessdate=2007-06-08 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703013428/http://www.nbtf.org/nbtf_history.html | archivedate=2007-07-03 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Held biennially since 1989 for six days, the NBTF showcases the best in [[African-American]] theater.

==Beginnings==
As he was doing research for a magazine article in the late 1980s, Hamlin discovered a disconnect between the number of black theatre companies at that time. He concluded that a festival could serve as a method to bring these companies together, and he contacted renowned author and poet [[Maya Angelou]] for support. Together, they raised $500,000 in grants and contributions to finance the festival's operating costs.&lt;ref name=robertson-larry&gt;{{cite news | last = Robertson | first = Campbell | title = Larry Leon Hamlin, 58, Dies; Promoted Black Theaters | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/08/arts/08hamlin.html?ei=5088&amp;en=4901c88d6649a970&amp;ex=1338955200&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss&amp;adxnnlx=1182960727-bVefLTqP+THfqm8Nz138hw | accessdate = 2007-06-27 | publisher = ''The New York Times'' | date=June 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Festival attracted 10,000 people and offered 30 different performances by 17 of America’s best professional black theatre companies. Its theme was "An International Celebration and Reunion of Spirit". Angelou served as the Festival's first chairperson, and other prominent African-American performers lent their professional and financial support.  It was covered by both the national and international media with wide acclaim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nbtf.org/nbtf_history.html | title=National Black Theatre Festival History Page | publisher=National Black Theatre Festival | year=2007 | accessdate=2007-06-27 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703013428/http://www.nbtf.org/nbtf_history.html | archivedate=2007-07-03 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges==
The NBTF has been successful, but not without difficulties. In 2001, the Festival faced serious financial troubles that threatened its existence.  Several funding sources reduced support and the budget for the Festival was left with a $300,000 deficit. In spite of this setback, Hamlin did not cancel the festival and was able to raise enough money to compensate the loss. He believed that African-American theatre was important and was able to make his dream a success.&lt;ref name=armstrong-black&gt;{{cite web | last = Armstrong | first = Linda | title = Black Theatre Family Holds Biannual Reunion; A firsthand report from the National Black Theatre Festival in Winston-Salem, N.C. | url = http://www.theatermania.com/content/news.cfm/story/1581 | accessdate = 2007-06-08 | year = 2001 | publisher = TheaterMania.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Today==
The NBTF brings nearly 60,000 people to Winston-Salem.&lt;ref name=dewan-six&gt;{{cite news | last = Dewan | first = Sheila | title = A Six-Day Bash Celebrates Black Theater | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/06/theater/newsandfeatures/06fest.html?ex=1280980800&amp;en=2a26eac01564f301&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss | accessdate = 2007-06-08 | publisher = ''The New York Times'' | date=August 6, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to over 100 theatrical performances, highlights of the Festival are the Opening Night Gala, the Readers' Theatre of New Works, the Youth/Celebrity Project, International Colloquia, the International Vendor's Market, a poetry slam, and various workshops and seminars. More than 50 celebrities can be expected to attend the Festival during its run.

The 2007 festival was the first without the direct guidance of Hamlin, who died on June 6, 2007; organizers continued preparations though his presence was missed.&lt;ref name="winsalemjournal"&gt;[http://www.journalnow.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=WSJ/MGArticle/WSJ_BasicArticle&amp;c=MGArticle&amp;cid=1173351523116 ''Winston-Salem Journal'': "Founder of National Black Theatre Festival dies"], June 6, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nicosia Old General Hospital''' was the chief hospital of [[Nicosia]], [[Cyprus]] from 1936 to 2006. In 2006, its patients were transferred to the [[Nicosia New General Hospital]], and it was demolished in 2010 amidst some controversy over whether it should have been preserved.

The decision for erecting a purpose built general [[hospital]] in [[Nicosia]] was taken during the British colonial administration of [[Cyprus]] in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Cyprus hospital move prompts data protection probe | date=20 March 2007 | publisher=Reuters | url =http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L20729202.htm | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2007-03-20 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was inaugurated on 14 April 1939 by the then British governor Richard Palmer. This coincided with the breakout of [[World War II]] and many British and Cypriot soldiers were transported there, away from the front line, for recovery. Cyprus escaped the fighting, apart from the occasional German bombing raid.

The building, designed by Polyvios Michaelides was one of the first structures in Cyprus to import the [[Bauhaus]] style of architecture from Germany and featured in the French journal ''L’Architecture d’aujourd’hui''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first =Stefanos | last =Evripidou | coauthors = | authorlink = | title =Why we should save Nicosia’s least-loved building | date =March 29, 2009 | publisher = | url =http://www.cyprus-mail.com/news/main.php?id=44862&amp;archive=1 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20090603163136/http://www.cyprus-mail.com/news/main.php?id=44862&amp;archive=1 | dead-url =yes | archive-date =June 3, 2009 | work =[[Cyprus Mail]] | pages = | accessdate =2009-04-09 | language = | df = }} &lt;/ref&gt;

The hospital served as a tertiary referral centre for most disciplines. Over time and with scientific and medical advances, it became apparent that the hospital premises were not fit for purpose. A [[Nicosia New General Hospital]] was constructed in the suburb of [[Latsia]] and was delivered in 2006. The last remaining patients were transferred over and the old hospital closed its emergency department on 8 October 2006, after 67 years of operation having treated millions of patients. It continues to run [[outpatients]] clinics and a psychiatric ward.

The fate of the old building has recently been surrounded by controversy. It lies in the centre of Nicosia on prime real estate and surrounded by dense eucalyptus woodland. The [[Cyprus Green Party]] has been campaigning for the building’s preservation, as it is considered as one of the few remaining examples of colonial architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=John | last=Leonidou | coauthors= | title=Greens campaign to save old hospital building | date= October 25, 2006 | publisher= | url =http://www.cyprus-mail.com/news/main.php?id=28628&amp;archive=1 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20070927203051/http://www.cyprus-mail.com/news/main.php?id=28628&amp;archive=1 | dead-url =yes | archive-date =September 27, 2007 | work =[[Cyprus Mail]] | pages = | accessdate = 2007-03-20 | language = }} &lt;/ref&gt; Plans to demolish it and to erect a new [[Cyprus Museum]] have been criticized by the Cyprus Architects Association, that has also championed its preservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first =Anna | last =Hassapi | coauthors = | authorlink = | title =Old hospital to be demolished in March to make way for museum | date =January 14, 2009 | publisher = | url =http://www.cyprus-mail.com/news/main.php?id=43504&amp;archive=1 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20090603162123/http://www.cyprus-mail.com/news/main.php?id=43504&amp;archive=1 | dead-url =yes | archive-date =June 3, 2009 | work =[[Cyprus Mail]] | pages = | accessdate =2009-04-09 | language = | df = }} &lt;/ref&gt;
The building was finally demolished and the contractor Philippos Kameris confirmed on 15 June 2010 that the work was completed.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

'''Norrköping Exhibition of Art and Industry''' ({{lang-sv|Konst- och industriutställningen i Norrköping}}) was an [[exhibition]] in [[Norrköping]], Sweden in 1906.

At the initiative of the local industrial association ''Norrköpings Fabriksförening och Handtverksförening'' it was decided an art and industrial exhibition should be held in Norrköping between June{{nbsp}}1{{snd}}September{{nbsp}}15, 1906.&lt;ref&gt;Hulting, Johan (Norrköping 1906), ''Norrköping och dess omgifningar. Officiell handbok utgifven af Förvaltningsutskottet för 1906 års Konst- och Industriutställning, s V-XX''.&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition was opened by the [[Gustaf V of Sweden|Crown Prince Gustaf]] and was mostly held at the area south of the Sylten neighbourhood.  The architect [[Carl Bergsten]] designed the exhibition's two main buildings the ''Industrihallen'' (industrial hall) that was {{convert|7500|m2|ft2|abbr=on}} with places for 630 exhibitiors, and the ''Konsthallen'' (art exhibition hall). He also designed the ''Jaktpaviljongen'' (hunting pavilion). [[Werner Northun]] designed the ''Maskinhallen'' (engines hall) at a total of {{convert|3600|m2|ft2|abbr=on}}, as well as the main restaurant seating 400 people and the ''Thaliatemplet'' theatre (500 folding chairs).

[[File:Gate of Old Jewish Cemetery Wrocław.jpg|thumb|Cemetery gate]]
[[File:Hands motif.jpg|thumb|Hands motif]]
The '''Old Jewish Cemetery in Wrocław''' is located in the southeast part of [[Wrocław]] (formerly known as Breslau), [[Poland]], currently along Ślężna street. The first burial took place on 17 November 1856 which back then was a village of Gabitz. The current shape of the cemetery evolved mostly during the 19th century, during the German period of the city. The cemetery area was expanded twice. In 1943 the burial ceremonies were abandoned and the necropoly was leased for five years to a gardening center. During [[World War II]], the cemetery became a fierce battleground, the marks of which are still visible on many [[tombstone]]s. After 1945 it slowly turned into ruins. It was put on the list of the city's monuments in 1975.

==Architecture==

Most of the cemetery objects were built in second half of the 19th century. They imitate various architectural styles including [[Ancient]], the [[Middle Ages]], [[Renaissance]], [[Baroque]]. Great example of Ancient architecture are numerous columns located throughout the cemetery that are symbols of life and eternity. Columns imitating broken trees reflect the tragedy of fragile life and death. Tombstones are signed by bilingual inscriptions, most commonly [[German language|German]] and [[Jewish languages|Jewish]].&lt;ref name="Wroclaw"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Stary Cmentarz Żydowski we Wrocławiu|last=Łagiewski|first=Maciej|publisher=Via Nova}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* oriental tree - ancient symbol of messianic hope
* broken rose - motif of death
* helmet - army officer symbol
* palms - symbols of national sacrifice of Jews &lt;ref name="Wroclaw" /&gt;

'''Paul Neumann''' (1839–July 2, 1901) was a lawyer, politician, and diplomat in [[California]] and the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]].

==Life==
Born in [[Prussia]], Neumann became a lawyer in [[California]] around 1864 and served three terms as a state senator of California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=California. Legislature. Senate |title=Journal of the Senate of the State of California |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hUFNAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA231 |year=1880 |publisher=State Printing Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He worked for fellow-[[German American]] [[Claus Spreckels]] (1828–1908), who maintained a monopoly of  the refining of sugar from Hawaii in California.
Neuman met Hawaiian royalty when they would come to California to be entertained by Spreckels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= San Francisco: Items of Interest from the Metropolis |newspaper= Sacramento Daily Record-Union |location= |date= October 24, 1881 |url= http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82014381/1881-10-24/ed-1/seq-3 |accessdate= July 19, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Neumann was the [[Republican Party of California]]'s candidate for the [[United States House of Representatives]] in  November 1882 for the [[San Francisco]] district.
However, he was denounced by the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' as being a "sugar coated candidate", being used by Spreckels to advance his own interests, and was defeated in the election. In 1883, Neumann came to the [[Hawaiian Islands]] to serve as legal counsel for Spreckels who was now the publisher of the ''[[Honolulu Advertiser]]'' newspaper, first in the fall for a short visit.&lt;ref name="kingdom3"&gt;{{cite book |title=Hawaiian Kingdom 1874-1893, the Kalakaua Dynasty |author= [[Ralph Simpson Kuykendall]] |url= http://www.ulukau.org/elib/cgi-bin/library?c=kingdom3&amp;l=en |volume=3 |publisher= University of Hawaii Press |year= 1967 |isbn= 978-0-87022-433-1 |pages=267–268}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He was one of the first [[Judaism|Jewish]] leaders in the Hawaiian Islands,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= The History of Kona Beth Shalom |work= web site for Congregation Kona Beth Shalom |url= http://www.konabethshalom.org/ourhistoryxx.htm |accessdate= June 18, 2010 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110726234717/http://www.konabethshalom.org/ourhistoryxx.htm |archivedate= July 26, 2011 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; although in later years he led a more secular life and did not raise his children in the Jewish faith.&lt;ref name="jew"/&gt;

Being from Europe, Neumann was comfortable around a monarchy, and made friends with the other Europeans in the islands.&lt;ref name="greek"&gt;{{cite journal |hdl=10524/422 |title=The Queen's "Greek Artillery Fire": Greek Royalists in the Hawaiian Revolution and Counterrevolution |author=Helen G. Chapin |journal=Hawaiian Journal of History |year=1981 |volume=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Kalākaua|King David Kalākaua]] and other members of the government depended on loans from Spreckels to support their lifestyles.
Within days of returning, Neumann was admitted to the bar and appointed as [[attorney general]] of the Kingdom of Hawaii, and a member of Kalākaua's [[Privy Council]]  on December 14, 1883.&lt;ref name="office"/&gt;
[[Walter M. Gibson]] had been acting as attorney general, even though he had no legal training. The cabinet stayed intact until June 30, 1886, when another combination (except Gibson) was brought in, probably at the suggestion of Spreckels.
Neumann was sometimes attacked by the conservative press for his "[[bohemianism]]", including playing [[Poker]] with the king, which the missionaries thought was sinful.&lt;ref name="kingdom3"/&gt; He had been president of the [[Bohemian Club]] in San Francisco.&lt;ref name="elisa"/&gt;
[[Charles T. Gulick]], although related to missionaries, also became a member of the Kalākaua cabinet as Minister of the Interior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://archives1.dags.hawaii.gov/gsdl/collect/governme/index/assoc/HASH01e6/502328b2.dir/Gulick,%20Charles%20T.jpg |title= Gulick, Charles T. office record |work= state archives digital collections |publisher= state of Hawaii |accessdate= June 18, 2010 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160303205518/http://archives1.dags.hawaii.gov/gsdl/collect/governme/index/assoc/HASH01e6/502328b2.dir/Gulick%2C%20Charles%20T.jpg |archivedate= March 3, 2016 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1884 Neumann was appointed to the [[House of Nobles (Hawaii)|House of Nobles]] in the kingdom legislature, and the board of health. 
He served as envoy to [[Mexico]] in 1884, and investigated forming a consular office in [[San Francisco]] in 1885. Under the new [[1887 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaii]], the House of Nobles became an elected office, so he lost his seat, until winning the election of 1892 for one more session.&lt;ref name="office"/&gt;

[[Liliuokalani|Queen Lili{{okina}}uokalani]] appointed him attorney general again on August 29, but he resigned the next day after a [[motion of no confidence]] in the legislature, when his scheme for a state [[lottery]] was heavily opposed in the legislature. On September 12 he was appointed again and served to November 1, 1892.&lt;ref name="office"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archives1.dags.hawaii.gov/gsdl/collect/governme/index/assoc/HASH0180/8da9d121.dir/Neumann,%20Paul.jpg |title=Neumann, Paul office record |work=state archives digital collections |publisher=state of Hawaii |accessdate=June 17, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303192440/http://archives1.dags.hawaii.gov/gsdl/collect/governme/index/assoc/HASH0180/8da9d121.dir/Neumann%2C%20Paul.jpg |archivedate=March 3, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neumann became the private attorney of the queen after the [[overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii]] in 1893.  He was sent to [[Washington, DC]] to protest the overthrow and plead for the restoration of the monarchy. After an editorial in the ''Advertiser'' offended him, Neumann (who had a wooden leg) attacked new editor Henry Northrop Castle (son of [[Samuel Northrup Castle]]) with his cane in December 1893.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= The Ex-Queen's attitude a Surprise: Her Desire to Behead Those Who Deposed Her Has Hurt Her Cause |newspaper= [[New York Times]] |date= February 3, 1894 |url= https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1894/02/11/106897623.pdf |format= pdf |accessdate= June 18, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
He defended Lili{{okina}}uokalani and other prisoners in a military tribunal following the failed [[1895 Counter-Revolution in Hawaii|1895 rebellion]] against the [[Republic of Hawaii]], where she was convicted of [[misprision of treason]]. He advised Lili{{okina}}uokalani to issue a formal abdication, which she did, and the revolutionaries were pardoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Abdication of Queen Liliuokalan: Safety at the Price of a Kingdom, of Little Moment Now for the Cause of the Royalists is a Lost Cause |newspaper= The Morning Call |location= San Francisco |date= February 7, 1895 |url=  http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn94052989/1895-02-07/ed-1/seq-1 |accessdate= July 19, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
When a circuit judge position opened up, he was passed over for the much younger [[William Stanley (Hawaii)|William Stanley]].&lt;ref name="judge"&gt;{{cite news |title= Selection Made: W. F. L.

After the islands were annexed to the [[United States]] in 1898, he became more resigned to the situation, and applied to be the first attorney from Hawaii to practice before the [[Supreme Court of the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Paul Neumann Here: Did not Plead the Cause of ex-Queen Liluokalani at Washington |newspaper= The San Francisco Call |location= San Francisco |date= February 28, 1899 |url= http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85066387/1899-02-28/ed-1/seq-10 |accessdate= July 19, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He did think the [[ceded lands|Crown Lands of Hawaii]] had been seized illegally, a case that is still controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Liluokalani will Ask for her Rights: Her First Visit was for her People, Now on her Own Mission  |newspaper= The San Francisco Call |location= San Francisco |date= November 22, 1898  |url= http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85066387/1898-11-22/ed-1/seq-7 |accessdate= July 19, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he had no government position, he was accepted in society enough to become toastmaster of the local [[Masonic Lodge]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Paul Neumann as Toastmaster: Unity First Sentiment  |newspaper= The hawaiian Gazette |location= Honolulu |date=July 5, 1898 |url=  http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83025121/1898-07-05/ed-1/seq-3 |accessdate= July 18, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and president of the Hawaii Bar Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Bar Association: Permanently Organized on a Non-Political Basis and the Debatable Resolutions are Withdrawn  |newspaper= The Independent |location= Honolulu |date= June 29, 1899 |url= http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85047097/1899-06-29/ed-1/seq-3|accessdate= July 18, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
He represented many of the Chinese victims of the [[Chinatown, Honolulu|Great Honolulu Chinatown Fire of 1900]].
He died July 2, 1901.&lt;ref name="obit"&gt;{{cite news |title= Death list of a day: Paul Neumann |newspaper= New York Times |date= July 9, 1901 |url= https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1901/07/09/117968460.pdf  |format= pdf |accessdate= July 17, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
At his funeral he was called "one of the most brilliant men who ever set foot on Hawaiian soil".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Local and General News: The Last Ceremony  |newspaper= The Independent |location= Honolulu |date= July 3, 1901 |url= http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85047097/1901-07-03/ed-1/seq-3 |accessdate= July 18, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was buried in [[Oahu Cemetery]].

His daughter Eva (1871–1921) married Alfred Fowler (1860–1933) and became a friend of [[Ezra Pound]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Ezra Pound and Dorothy Shakespear, their letters, 1909-1914 |editor= A.

Neumann's wife Elisa also moved to London, as did daughter Lily Neumann who married Robert MacDonald Bird.
Other daughters Anita A. Neumann married Herman T. Focke in Honolulu in 1895, and Inez Sophie Neumann married William F. C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2129">'''Phisoderm''' is a skin [[detergent]] which assists persons who are allergic to soap and Phisohex, a detergent&lt;ref name=jim/&gt; and sudsless cleanser&lt;ref name=hex/&gt; which prevents the spread of infections.
In the 1950s both Phisoderm and Phisohex were manufactured by Winthrop Laboratories. Earlier the product  was made by [[Fairchild Brothers &amp; Foster]]. Phisoderm was developed by Dr. B. Thurber Guild (1886 ''-'' 1958), a physician and pharmaceutical manufacturer. Guild practiced medicine in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] and was a specialist in allergies.&lt;ref name=jim&gt;''Dr. B. Thurber Guild, Allergist, Was 72'', [[New York Times]], June 17, 1958, pg. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; The brand is currently owned by [[Mentholatum]].

==Withdrawal from sale and reinstatement==

Both Phisoderm and Phisohex were removed by drugstores and retail outlet stores when the [[Food and Drug Administration]] halted the production and distribution of products containing more than 1% of [[hexachlorophene]], in September 1972.&lt;ref name=hex&gt;''[[Germicide]] Limit Stirs Confusion'', New York Times, September 24, 1972, pg. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Phisoderm continued to be produced by Winthrop Laboratories, a division of [[Sterling Drug]], in 1980. An [[over-the-counter drug]], its advertising was carried out by Warren Muller Dulubowsky.&lt;ref&gt;''A Sterling Drug Account May Be Up For Grabs'', New York Times, April 14, 1980, pg. D7.&lt;/ref&gt; By April 1989 Sterling Drug was owned by [[Eastman Kodak]]. Three Sterling brands, Haley's M-O, Philips' Milk of Magnesia, and Phisoderm, were being advertised by N.W. Ayer.&lt;ref&gt;''Advertising, Moves By Sterling'', New York Times, November 8, 1989, pg. D25.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991 the Phisoderm account was picked up by Ammirati &amp; Puris of [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;''Advertising'' New York Times, June 25, 1991, pg. D21.&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Bayer]] bought Sterling in 1994, [[Chattem]] acquired the Phisoderm brand by that time. In 2005, it was sold to The Mentholatum Company.

'''''Polly''''' was an [[United States|American]] [[brig]] that was swamped during a gale in late 1811, and spent the next six months adrift in the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The saga of ''Polly'' was mentioned by [[Edgar Allan Poe]] in his novel ''[[The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket]]''.&lt;ref name="Poe2004"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym |title=The Essential Tales and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe |last=Poe |first=Edgar Allan |year=2004 |publisher=Spark Educational Publishing |page=540 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0sJr1xPt30UC&amp;pg=PA540 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

''Polly'' was a 131-ton brig constructed at [[Pembroke, Massachusetts]] in 1791, probably by shipbuilders Alden Briggs, Calvin Turner and Ichabod Thomas, Jr.&lt;ref name="Briggs1889"&gt;{{cite book |title=History of Shipbuilding on North River, Plymouth County, Massachusetts |last=Briggs |first=Lloyd Vernon |year=1889 |publisher=Coburn Brothers |pages=174 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lgsWDUXvU2QC }}&lt;/ref&gt; During her service life, the ship was home ported in [[Boston, Massachusetts]].

==Shipwreck==

On December 12, 1811, ''Polly'' departed Boston with a cargo of [[lumber]] and provisions (including salted meat) bound for the [[Virgin Islands]].&lt;ref name="doremus"&gt;[[The Passing Parade]] by [[John Doremus]], [[2CH|Radio 2CH]], 20:40 [[AEST]] September 21, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The ship was commanded by Captain Casneau,&lt;ref name="Howes1892"&gt;{{cite book |title=Genealogy of the Howes Family in America |last=Howes |first=Joshua Crowell |year=1892 |publisher=F. Hallett |pages=205  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EWUXq8epi5UC }}&lt;/ref&gt; and carried eight others: the mate, four seamen, an Indian cook,&lt;ref name="Howes1892"/&gt; a passenger named Mr. Hunt, and a 12-year-old&lt;ref name="doremus"/&gt; African-American slave or servant girl belonging to Hunt.&lt;ref name="Poe2004"/&gt;

Three days out, on December 15, the ''Polly'' was caught in a severe [[gale]].&lt;ref name="Grocott1997"&gt;{{cite book |title=Shipwrecks of the Revolutionary &amp; Napoleonic Eras  |last=Grocott |first=Terence |year=1998 |publisher=Stackpole Books |pages=xiii  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YD3FnOwPgBkC }}&lt;/ref&gt; The storm capsized the ship and the masts were either carried away by the storm, or cut away by the crew. Relieved of the topweight, ''Polly'' rolled back onto an even keel. The ship was completely filled with water, but the cargo of lumber kept the ship afloat.&lt;ref name="Marvin2006"&gt;{{cite book |title=The American Merchant Marine: Its History and Romance from 1620 to 1902 |last=Marvin |first=Winthrop T. |year=2006 |publisher=Kessinger Publishing |pages=189–190  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q6RumhEtMzUC }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, two people, one of whom was Hunt, were lost during the storm, and the girl was badly injured.&lt;ref name="doremus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marvin2006"/&gt;

The survivors began to salvage the wreck for usable items. Quantities of salted pork were recovered, and the survivors ate that raw until the cook managed to start a fire twelve days after the wreck, by using two sticks rubbed together.&lt;ref name="Marvin2006"/&gt; The supplies of salted pork ran out after forty days, and the survivors were forced to eat [[barnacle]]s scraped off the hull, and the occasional shark and fish. The barnacles were exhausted by mid-April, but the survivors managed to catch additional fish.&lt;ref name="Marvin2006"/&gt; Stores of fresh water ran out after eighteen days, and water was subsequently obtained from a makeshift [[still]] made out of a tea kettle, a metal pot, and a pistol.&lt;ref name="Howes1892"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marvin2006"/&gt; Seawater was boiled in the pot, and condensation was captured in the tea kettle.&lt;ref name="Howes1892"/&gt;

Over the next 191 days, ''Polly'' drifted across the Atlantic. The hulk was passed by over a dozen ships, but none offered assistance.&lt;ref name="Poe2004"/&gt; Henry Howes, the first mate,&lt;ref name="Marvin2006"/&gt; was the first of the survivors to die, either 43&lt;ref name="Howes1892"/&gt; or 50 days&lt;ref name="Marvin2006"/&gt; after the wreck. Three other crewmen followed suit. Some references indicate the cook died at this time,&lt;ref name="Marvin2006"/&gt; while others indicate the cook survived the ordeal.&lt;ref name="Howes1892"/&gt; By the 65th day, only two survivors remained.&lt;ref name="Howes1892"/&gt;

On June 19, 1812, Captain Casneau and either the cook&lt;ref name="Howes1892"/&gt; or a crewmember named Samuel Badger,&lt;ref name="Poe2004"/&gt; were rescued by Captain Featherstone of the British ship ''Fame'', en route to [[London]] from [[Rio de Janeiro]]. The crew were picked up 600 leagues (3,330 kilometers) west of [[Marrakesh]],&lt;ref name="Grocott1997"/&gt; having drifted over two thousand miles across the Atlantic.&lt;ref name="Poe2004"/&gt; On July 9, the survivors were transferred to the brig ''Dromero'' and taken back to the United States.&lt;ref name="Poe2004"/&gt;

The story of the ''Polly'' is mentioned in an in-character footnote in Chapter 13 of [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s ''[[The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket]]''. Poe's narrator, Arthur Pym, refers to the ordeal as similar to the one he experiences in the course of the narrative.&lt;ref name = "Poe2004"/&gt; Poe's source for the material may have been R. Thomas' ''Remarkable Events and Remarkable Shipwrecks'', published in 1836.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Huntress |first1=Keith |year=1944 |title=Another Source for Poe's Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym |journal=American Literature |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=19–25 |publisher=Duke University Press |jstor=2920915 |doi=10.2307/2920915}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Pontoffel Pock, Where Are You?''''' (titled '''''Pontoffel Pock &amp; His Magic Piano''''' for the sing-a-long videocasette release) is an [[Animation|animated]]  [[Musical film|musical]] [[television special]] written by [[Dr. Seuss]], directed by Gerard Baldwin, produced by [[DePatie–Freleng Enterprises]], completed in 1979 and first aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] on May 2, 1980. This was one of the final cartoons done at DePatie–Freleng as the studio would be sold to [[Marvel Comics]] and become [[Marvel Productions]] in 1981. The songs are by [[Joe Raposo]].

==Plot==
Pontoffel Pock confuses the "Pullum" and "Pushum" controls for a device that places pickles into jars, wreaking havoc at the [[pickled cucumber|dill pickle]] factory and prompting the owner to deny him of work. Now having been denied of a job, Pontoffel returns alone to his dilapidated house and wishes that he could "get away from it all". He is immediately visited by McGillicuddy, a representative of the "Amalgamated Do-Gooding [[fairy|Fairies]]" who says: "Pontoffel Pock, your wish has been heard, and your wish has been granted." McGillicuddy and his [[fairy]] associates, Humboldt and Higby (and later on, Hoikendorf), give him a magical flying piano that takes him anywhere in the world. To do so, Pontoffel Pock plays these six very simple notes (C, C, C, D, D#, E) and then chooses a destination by pressing one of many differently-colored buttons, which fly him to his destination. The first place he goes to is Groogen (based on [[Switzerland]]).

Pontoffel recklessly flies through Groogen, scaring the locals ("Groogenites") out of their wits and causing a flugelhorn to get damaged. In a measure of self-defense, he is attacked by their "Goomy Gun", which fires multi-colored paint, that turns his piano yellow and causes its motor to lose power. He plummets downward, but at the last second Pontoffel "twitches the Homing Pigeon Switch" that sends him and the piano home. When he gets home, McGillicuddy at first attempts to take the piano back for Pontoffel's failure, calling him a "show-off" and a "smart-aleck", but eventually relents and gives Pontoffel a second chance.

The piano's next destination is Casbahmopolis (based on [[The Middle East]]), where Pontoffel falls in love with a girl named Neefa Feefa, a famous "eyeball dancer" who dislikes her job of dancing for the King and, like Pontoffel, wants to "get away from it all". He infiltrates the King's palace to rescue her and is pursued and surrounded by the palace guards, one of whom breaks the Homing Pigeon Switch such that Pontoffel cannot take Neefa Feefa home with him. When he decides to travel somewhere else, he loses control of the piano and Neefa Feefa slips off into the guards' clutches. Having lost his sense of direction, Pontoffel starts pushing random buttons, sending him to several different places (which are based on many ''real'' places such as the [[North Pole]], the [[Congo region]], [[Spain]], [[Waikiki]], [[Africa]], [[Japan]], and others, including Seuss's birthplace of [[Springfield, Massachusetts]]) in the hope of returning to her.

Meanwhile, McGillicuddy gets worried, having not heard from Pontoffel in a long time, so he enlists the help of all of his [[fairy]] associates to fly all over the world, looking for him by song: "Pontoffel Pock, Where The Heck Are You?" Finally remembering the right button, Pontoffel goes straight to Neefa Feefa, only to crash-land into the tower where she is being kept prisoner and destroy the piano. Neefa Feefa voices a wish to "get away from it all", just as Pontoffel had earlier, which comes to the attention of the fairies who appear to grant her wish. They are escorted home together, and for proving himself, Pontoffel is somehow hired at the pickle factory, along with Neefa Feefa. Outside, a [[rainbow]] appears as the Fairies fly the worn-out piano away.

'''Sakhi Sarwar''' ([[Urdu]], [[Saraiki language|Saraiki]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]]: {{Nastaliq|سخی سرور}}) is a town in [[Dera Ghazi Khan District]], [[Pakistan]]. It is named after a [[Muslim]] [[Sufi]] saint [[Syed Ahmad Sultan]], also known as Sakhi Sarwar, whose [[tomb]] is situated in the vicinity.&lt;ref name=TheNews/&gt;

The tomb itself was built in the 13th century in a small village named Muqam in the [[Sulaiman Mountains]], {{convert|35|km|mi}} from [[Dera Ghazi Khan]] city.&lt;ref name=TheNews&gt;[https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/194677-The-attan-and-the-dance-of-death Sakhi Sarwar Town on The News International website], Published 27 March 2017, Retrieved 24 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt; It was later expanded by the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] king [[Babur|Zahir-ud-din Muhammad Babur]]. It is a unique building of [[Mughal architecture]].

An ''[[urs]]'', or festival in the honour of Syed Ahmad Sultan, also locally called "Sangh [[Mela]]", has been celebrated for centuries during [[Vaisakhi]] (March–April), with thousands of pilgrims coming to the town from the nearby localities. Historically, followers of Syed Ahmad Sultan belonged to various religions – [[Max Arthur Macauliffe]], a colonial office appointed in Punjab, observed in 1875 that not only Muslims but Hindus also visited the shrines during the ''urs''.{{cn|date=February 2016}}

On 3 April 2011, at the annual festival (''[[urs]]'') in the honour Syed Ahmad Sultan, a [[2011 Dera Ghazi Khan bombings|twin suicide attack]] left 112 dead and almost two hundred injured.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thenews.com.pk/archive/amp/296565-mastermind-of-sakhi-sarwar-carnage-held-from-taunsa, The News International newspaper, Published 19 April 2011, Retrieved 24 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sandra Samuel''' (born {{circa|1964}}) is an [[India]]n [[nanny]] who saved the life of two-year-old Moshe Holtzberg during the [[November 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks]]. Samuel saved Holtzberg when [[Nariman House]] was attacked by the terrorists. Both of Holtzberg's parents were killed in the attack. Samuel now lives in Israel after being granted honorary citizenship in 2010. She works for ALEH in Jerusalem and still has a relationship with Moshe.

==Background==
Samuel had been living in the [[Nariman House|Mumbai Chabad House]] and working for Rabbi [[Gavriel Holtzberg]] and his wife, [[Rivka Holtzberg|Rivka]], since 2003. The Holtzbergs were the [[Israel]]-born directors of the house run by the global [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] [[Chabad]] movement. Samuel had been the nanny caring for the Holtzbergs' son Moshe since his birth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nydailynews.com/news/us_world/2008/12/04/2008-12-04_inside_hero_nannys_dash_to_save_young_bo.html Inside hero nanny's dash to save young boy during Mumbai massacre] by Aimee Ginsburg, New York Daily News, 5 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Samuel stated that she called them "my rabbi" and "my Rivki." When she started working there in 2003, it was expected to be a temporary job but she stated that she was "so captivated by their generous, courageous spirits" that she stayed on. When Moshe was born, she took the role of nanny.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2008Dec08/0,4670,MLMumbaiOrphanapossNanny,00.html Nanny moves to Israel with boy orphaned in Mumbai] by Amy Teibel, Associated Press (reprinted by the Fox News), 8 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2008, her husband, John, a [[Syrian Malabar Nasrani|Keralite]] who worked as a mechanic, died suddenly in his sleep of an undiagnosed illness. She has two sons, Martin and Jackson, who were aged 18 and 25 at the time of the attack. She is a Christian. Samuel's family was originally from [[Goa]] but she lived most of her life in Mumbai.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,24776746-2703,00.html Israel welcomes selfless Mumbai nanny Sandra Samuel]". ''The Australian''. 10 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/printArticle/550578 Nanny recalls rescue of Jewish toddler] by Amy Teibel, [[Associated Press]] (reprinted by the [[Toronto Star]]), 9 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.rediff.com/slide-show/2009/nov/23/slide-show-1-anniversary-26-11-exclusive-encounter-with-sandra-samuel.htm Sandra Samuel one year after 26/11: 'I could have saved the mother'] by Vaihayasi P Daniel, Rediff.com, 23 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attack on the Nariman House==
On 26 November 2008, as the [[November 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks|Mumbai attacks]] began, [[Nariman_House#Terrorist_attack|a group of attackers entered the Chabad house]] and began shooting at everyone inside. Samuel heard gunshots and locked herself in a laundry room as she heard Rivka screaming. Later, she heard Moshe  calling out her name and crying. After emerging from the room and running upstairs, she found Gavriel and Rivka motionless and covered in blood with Moshe crying beside them, his pants drenched in blood. With the attackers still inside, Samuel said she grabbed Moshe and ran from the building. Later, when Indian commando teams stormed the house, it was confirmed that Gavriel and Rivka were among the 173 people killed in the attacks, and that Moshe was now an orphan.&lt;ref name=Sandra1&gt;[http://www.canadaeast.com/rss/article/498264 Young orphan of slain rabbi, wife arrives in Israel after Mumbai nightmare] by [[Mark Lavie]], Associated Press (reprinted by ''CanadaEast''), 1 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==After the attack==
The [[Chabad movement]]'s leaders decided Moshe should not stay in [[India]] and that he would be relocated to [[Israel]] where he has family. However, the movement insisted that Samuel be allowed to come with him, because, as a Chabad spokesperson stated: "At this point she's the only one the boy is responding to."&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.indiainfo.com/2008/12/01/0812011439_terror-nanny.html Israeli immigration permit to Indian nanny] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110617035245/http://news.indiainfo.com/2008/12/01/0812011439_terror-nanny.html |date=17 June 2011 }}, Indiainfo.com, 1 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although Samuel had no [[passport]], Moshe's grand uncle, Rabbi [[Yitzchak Dovid Grossman]], helped arrange for her to get a [[Visa (document)|visa]] to come to Israel with Holtzberg to help him start his new life. The Israeli government under [[Foreign Affairs Minister of Israel|Foreign Minister]] [[Tzipi Livni]] granted Samuel a special visa offering immigration status. They left India for Israel shortly after attending Moshe's parents' funeral.&lt;ref name=Sandra1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3630653,00.html Chabad: Allow Indian nanny to immigrate to Israel], [[Ynet]] News, 30 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 December 2008, Samuel gave an interview with [[CNN]] in which she said she sees no heroism in her actions and that she wishes she could have been able to help more people, especially Moshe's parents. She also stated that she still has nightmares about the attacks. Currently, Samuel is living in Israel where she remains the caregiver for Moshe, who she says is learning to play again although he likes to have her close by. Samuel told an interviewer, "They said it is important I am here [in Israel]. Me, I just take care of the baby." When asked about her plans for the future, Samuel said she would stay in Israel for as long as Moshe needs her.&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/12/04/nanny.mumbai.interview/index.html In her own words, nanny's brave escape in Mumbai], CNN, 4 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nypost.com/seven/12052008/news/worldnews/i_just_took_kid__ran_142806.htm 'I Just Took Kid and Ran' - Hero Nanny Relives Mumbai Escape] by Cathy Burke, [[New York Post]], 5 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; She stated that "No one knows how much Moshe saw, or how much he knows.

Samuel later revealed that she was not supposed to be at the Chabad house that evening because she usually visited one of her sons on Wednesday evenings. She stated that "God kept me there because God already knew what would happen."&lt;ref name=Orphansafe&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&amp;objectid=10547662 |title=Orphan safe in arms of nanny rescuer after Mumbai attacks |author=Lynfield, Ben |date=12 December 2008 |agency=[[The Independent]] |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=7 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a subsequent interview, Samuel stated that Moshe Holtzberg is happy again, and that he "is like a normal kid, just enjoying himself. He has gotten used to other people surrounding him. He loves it here. He is in very good condition, just like normal. He is having his breakfast, lunch and snacks and he sleeps very well now." She added that he no longer cries out for his parents: "He is not even asking for them now because he is too happy. He loves it here. He has swings, a garden, a see-saw."&lt;ref name=Orphansafe/&gt;

Samuel and Holtzberg initially stayed with Rabbi Grossman after arriving in Israel. However, they later moved to [[Afula]] to live with his maternal grandparents.&lt;ref name=Orphansafe/&gt;

In early December 2008, fifth-graders at Solomon Schecter Day School in [[Jericho, New York]] wrote individual letters to Samuel to thank her for saving Holtzberg's life. The students cited Samuel's heroism based on the Jewish tradition that "one who saves one person saves an entire nation."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3637426,00.html New York students thank Indian nanny for saving Chabad orphan], [[Ynet]] News, 12 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6UAYE8gQz8 5th Graders thank Sandra Samuel, Mumbai Heroine], Youtube.com.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indianexpress.com/news/fifth-graders-thank-moshes-nanny-sandra/397616/ Fifth graders thank Moshe's nanny Sandra], Indianexpress.com, 12 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==

===Esfira Maiman Women Rescuers Medal===
On 30 November 2008, the [[International Raoul Wallenberg Foundation]], at a special session, unanimously voted to grant Sandra Samuel the Esfira Maiman Women Rescuers Medal in recognition of her bravery. The foundation stated that "Sandra has taught us two lessons of cardinal importance. The first one is that human solidarity is agnostic to race and religion. The second lesson, not less important, is that rescuers are still very much relevant nowadays, as they were more than six decades ago."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.raoulwallenberg.net/?en/news/international-raoul-wallenberg.5242.htm The International Raoul Wallenberg Foundation to honor Mumbai rescuer]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, [[International Raoul Wallenberg Foundation]], 2 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5738">'''Soliciting to murder'''
It shall be unlawful for any person or agent of that person to solicit another person or persons to cause the death of a human being by the act of murder in the first degree as is defined by Section 701.7 of this title. A person who is convicted, pleads guilty or pleads nolo contendere to the act of solicitation for murder in the first degree, except as provided in Section 701.7 of this title, shall be guilty of a felony punishable by imprisonment in a state penal institution for not less than five (5) years nor more than life imprisonment in the State Penitentiary.
In common parlance, the act of soliciting to murder may be thought of as "hiring a hitman", though the word "hiring" is used loosely, and the act requires no financial transaction to qualify as such. Merely the intent to engage another in an act of murder qualifies as soliciting.

==England and Wales==
This offence is created by section 4 of the [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]] which reads:

{{Blockquote|...&amp;nbsp;whosoever shall solicit, encourage, persuade, or endeavour to persuade, or shall propose to any person, to [[Murder in English law|murder]] any other person, whether he be a subject of Her Majesty or not, and whether he be within the Queen’s dominions or not, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and being convicted thereof shall be liable ... to [imprisonment for life] ...}}

===Textual amendments===

The words omitted at the beginning were repealed by sections 5(10)(a) and 65(5) of, and Schedule 13 to, the [[Criminal Law Act 1977]].

The words omitted elsewhere were repealed by the [[Statute Law Revision Act 1892]].

The words "imprisonment for life" were substituted for the words from "be kept" to "years", on 8 September 1977,&lt;ref&gt;The [[Criminal Law Act 1977 (Commencement No. 1) Order 1977]] (S.I. 1977/1365)&lt;/ref&gt; by section 5(10)(b) of the [[Criminal Law Act 1977]].

===Case law===

The following cases are relevant:
*''R v Fox'' (1870) 19 WR 109 (Ir)
*''R v Banks'' (1873) 12 Cox 393
*''R v Ransford'' (1874) 13 Cox 9, (1874) 3 LT 488, [[Court for Crown Cases Reserved|CCR]]
*''R v Most'' (1881) 7 QBD 244, (1881) 14 Cox 583, (1881) 45 JP 696&lt;ref&gt;In this case, the defendant published an article in a newspaper the gist of which was that the recent assassination of the Russian Tsar was wonderful news and was to be held up as an example to revolutionaries everywhere. He was convicted.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''R v Bourtzeff'' (1898) 127 CCC Sess Pap 284

*''R v Shephard'' [1919] 2 KB 125, 14 [[Criminal Appeal Reports|Cr App R]] 26, [[Court of Criminal Appeal|CCA]]

===Visiting forces===

Soliciting to murder is an [[offence against the person]] for the purposes of section 3 of the [[Visiting Forces Act 1952]].&lt;ref&gt;The [[Visiting Forces Act 1952]], section 3(6) and [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo6and1Eliz2/15-16/67/schedule Schedule], paragraph 1(b)(i)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mode of trial===

Soliciting to murder is an [[indictable-only offence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/s_to_u/sentencing_manual/soliciting_to_murder/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111113094953/http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/s_to_u/sentencing_manual/soliciting_to_murder/ |archivedate=2011-11-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orders on conviction===

As to violent offender orders, see section 98(3) of the [[Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008]].

===History===

Initially, a person guilty of an offence under section 4 was liable on conviction to [[penal servitude]] for a term not more than ten and not less than three years or to be imprisoned for a term not exceeding two years, with or without [[hard labour]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/24-25/100/crossheading/homicide/enacted&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1948&lt;ref&gt;The [[Criminal Justice Act 1948]], section 1(1)&lt;/ref&gt; to 8 September 1977, the maximum sentence was imprisonment for a term of ten years.

==Northern Ireland==
This offence is created by section 4 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861. The penalty was increased by article 5(1) of the [[Criminal Law (Northern Ireland) Order 1977]] (S.I. 1977/1249 (N.I. 16)).

==Republic of Ireland==
This offence is created by section 4 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861.&lt;ref&gt;The [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/isbc/bps1861.html Irish Statute Book] says that has been neither repealed nor otherwise amended.&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Super Best Friends'''" is the third episode of the [[South Park (season 5)|fifth season]] of the American animated television series ''[[South Park]]'', and the 68th episode of the series overall. It first aired on [[Comedy Central]] in the [[United States]] on July 4, 2001. In the episode, [[Stan Marsh|Stan]], [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] and [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] discover the magician [[David Blaine]] performing in South Park and decide to join his cult, the Blaintologists. Stan quickly finds out that the Blaintologists are not as nice as everyone thinks and tries to convince the other boys they've been brainwashed, and have forsaken their friends and families. Teaming up with Jesus, Stan calls upon the Super Best Friends, a parody of the [[Super Friends]], to destroy Blaine and thwart the [[mass suicide]] pact he has launched.

The episode was written by series co-creator [[Trey Parker]] and is rated [[TV-MA]] in the United States. It depicts several religious figures, [[Depictions of Muhammad|including Muhammad]], whose appearance at the time of the original airing caused little to no controversy. Following [[Islamism|Islamists']] death threats regarding Muhammad's portrayal in the 2010 episode titled "[[201 (South Park)|201]]", the South Park Studios website no longer streams "Super Best Friends", nor is it available for streaming or purchase from online stores. The episode has been replaced on the South Park Studios with a notice: "We apologize that South Park Studios cannot stream Super Best Friends."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southparkstudios.com/episodes/103940/ |title=Super Best Friends (Season 5, Episode 4) – Full Episode Player |publisher=South Park Studios |date= |accessdate=2016-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The episode was also featured in [[broadcast syndication|syndication]], but was permanently removed after the threats.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} It is one of three episodes which are unavailable on [[Hulu]], along with season 14's "[[200 (South Park)|200]]" and the aforementioned "201."

In 2013, fans voted "Super Best Friends" as the best episode of Season 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southparkstudios.com/fans/summer-of-south-park/season-5 |title=Summer of South Park (Season 5) |publisher=South Park Studios |date= |accessdate=2013-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
[[David Blaine]] visits South Park, impressing the town's residents, including [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], [[Stan Marsh|Stan]], [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]], and [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]], with his [[magic (illusion)|street magic]]. Mesmerized, the boys join the cult of "Blaintology," hoping to learn more about magic. Stan becomes progressively more disturbed by the cult and soon leaves, but Kyle refuses to join him, and so Stan asks [[Jesus (South Park)|Jesus]] for help.  Meanwhile, Kyle and Cartman go door to door in a [[proselytizing|recruitment drive]], sporting nametags labeled "[[LDS Missionary|Elder]] Kyle" and "Elder Cartman."

Jesus appears at Blaine's show in [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]], and challenges him by performing the [[feeding the multitude|miracle of the loaves and fish]]... after requesting that everybody in the audience turn around; Blaine manages to win the crowd with much more powerful enchantments. Jesus promptly requires the assistance of the Super Best Friends: a group of major religious figures including [[Muhammad]], [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], [[Moses]], [[Joseph Smith]], [[Krishna]], [[Laozi]] and "Sea Man", an [[Aquaman]]-like character.&lt;ref&gt;Amos N. Guiora, Freedom From Religion: Rights and National Security, Oxford Univ Pr, 2011, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;  They are dedicated to defending the world against [[evil]] (except for Buddha, who "[[Problem of evil#Buddhism|doesn't really believe in evil]]").

The Blaintologists, meanwhile, petition the government for [[tax exemption|tax-exempt status]]. Their request is denied, and all the Blaintologists are told that they are to commit [[mass suicide]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] Kyle is shown to have escaped the cult's control, but when he tries to convince Cartman that they should flee, Cartman reports him, and Kyle is imprisoned in a glass bubble and forced to participate at the mass suicide. When word about the mass suicide reaches the Super Best Friends, they consult [[Moses]] (previously seen in "[[Jewbilee]]") for advice.

In D.C., the Blaintologists begin to drown themselves in the [[Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool|Reflecting Pool]] even though it is only approximately a foot deep, while Cartman installs a hose in Kyle's glass bubble to fill it with water, so as to drown him. The Super Best Friends arrive at the scene, to which Blaine responds by animating the [[Lincoln Memorial|statue of Abraham Lincoln]] to fight them.

Meanwhile, Stan searches for his friends, first finding Kenny drowned in the pool and shouting "Oh my God! They killed Kenny!", to which Kyle replies "You bastards!"; they alternately repeat their catchphrases in [[Marco Polo (game)|Marco Polo]] fashion to find each other. In order to defeat the [[Abraham Lincoln]] statue, the Super Best Friends create a giant animated [[John Wilkes Booth]] statue, which shoots it in the head, causing it to fall over and shatter Kyle's prison. Afterwards, Joseph Smith uses his ice powers to freeze the reflecting pool so as to prevent more suicides.

It is revealed that Cartman has not managed to kill himself, as he keeps coming up for air.  Blaine curses the Super Best Friends for ruining his plans and flies away in a rocket ship. Stan finally announces that any religion which forces people to relinquish their money or control over their lives is really a cult. After his speech, Kyle reconciles with Stan, they amuse themselves with kicking a taunting Cartman in the testicles, and the episode ends with the Super Best Friends flying away.

==References to Scientology==
In the DVD commentary, Parker states that the episode's references to real-life magician [[David Blaine]] and ''Blaintology'' were allusions to [[Scientology]].&lt;ref&gt;Season 5 DVD commentary&lt;/ref&gt;

==Depiction of Muhammad==
[[File:South park muhammad.jpg|thumb|[[Muhammad]], as portrayed in "Super Best Friends", is described as "the Muslim prophet with the powers of flame".&lt;ref name="nyt-douthat" /&gt;]]
{{see also|Depictions of Muhammad|200 (South Park)|201 (South Park)}}
In 2005, cartoon depictions of [[Muhammad]] became more controversial during the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|''Jyllands-Posten'' Muhammad cartoons controversy]]. The creators of ''South Park'' returned to this theme in later episodes, parodying censorship attempts and portraying Muhammad again in the 2006 episodes "[[Cartoon Wars Part I]]" and  "[[Cartoon Wars Part II]]"&lt;ref name=nyt-douthat&gt;{{cite news|last=Douthat|first=Ross|title=Not Even in South Park?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/26/opinion/26douthat.html|newspaper=New York Times|date=April 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and again in the 2010 episode "[[200 (South Park)|200]]". Further controversy ensued, and one group, "[[Revolution Muslim]]", warned that South Park's creators would "probably wind up like [[Theo van Gogh (film director)|Theo van Gogh]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8636455.stm|title=South Park creators warned over Muhammad depiction|publisher=BBC | date=April 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around this time, the original "Super Best Friends" episode was removed from the South Park Studios website.&lt;ref name="nyt-douthat" /&gt;

==Home release==
"Super Best Friends", along with the fourteen other episodes from ''South Park: the Complete Fifth Season'', were released on a three-disc DVD set in the United States on February 22, 2005. The sets included brief audio commentaries by Parker and Stone for each episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=South Park: The Complete Fifth Season DVD Review |publisher=Bullz-Eye |date=February 26, 2009 |last=Codding |first=Jamey  |url=http://www.bullz-eye.com/television_reviews/2001/south_park_5.htm |accessdate=April 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The episode was included in the re-release of the fifth season on [[Blu-ray]], released on December 5, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/South-Park-Seasons-1-through-5-Blu/23779 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-11-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171105165404/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/South-Park-Seasons-1-through-5-Blu/23779 |archivedate=2017-11-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first time the episode was made available in [[High-definition video|HD]], as the episode was not released alongside the rest of the season when it debuted in HD on [[iTunes]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;https://itunes.apple.com/us/tv-season/south-park-season-5/id213888284&lt;/ref&gt; The episode is shown in its original presentation, without Muhammad's image being obscured as in later episodes of the series.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thedigitalbits.com/item/south-park-season-5-brd&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Telemachus''' ({{IPAc-en|t|ə|ˈ|l|ɛ|m|ə|k|ə|s}} {{respell|tə|LEM|ə-kəs}}; [[Ancient Greek]]: Τηλέμαχος ''Tēlemakhos'', literally "far-fighter") is a figure in [[Greek mythology]], the son of [[Odysseus]] and [[Penelope]], and a central character in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]''. The first four books of the ''Odyssey'' focus on Telemachus's journeys in search of news about his father, who has yet to return home from the [[Trojan War]], and are traditionally given the title the ''[[Telemachy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Odyssey''. [[George Herbert Palmer]], 1921, prose.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==

Telemachus's name in [[Greek language|Greek]] means "far from battle", or perhaps "fighting from afar", as a bowman does.&lt;ref&gt;Brann, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Tr0sHkgKBmUC&amp;pg=PA277 p. 277].&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Odyssey''==
[[File:Mnesterophonia Louvre CA7124.jpg|thumb|right|Slaughter of the suitors by Odysseus and Telemachus, [[Campania]]n red-figure bell-[[krater]], ca. 330 BC, [[Louvre]] (CA 7124)]]

In Homer's ''Odyssey'', Telemachus, under the instructions of [[Athena]] (who accompanies him during the quest), spends the first four books trying to gain knowledge of his father, Odysseus, who left for Troy when Telemachus was still an infant. At the outset of Telemachus' journey, Odysseus had been absent from his home at [[Ithaca]] for twenty years due to the Trojan War and the intervention of [[Poseidon]]. During his absence, Odysseus' house has been occupied by hordes of suitors seeking the hand of Penelope.&lt;ref&gt;Homer, ''Odyssey'' Books I–II&lt;/ref&gt; Telemachus first visits [[Nestor (mythology)|Nestor]] and is well received by the old man who regales him with stories of his father's glory. Telemachus then departs with Nestor's son [[Peisistratus (Odyssey)|Peisistratus]],&lt;ref&gt;Homer ''Odyssey'' Book III&lt;/ref&gt; who accompanies him to the halls of [[Menelaus]] and his wife [[Helen of Troy|Helen]]. Whilst there, Telemachus is again treated as an honored guest as Menelaus and Helen tell complementary yet contradictory stories of his father's exploits at Troy.&lt;ref&gt;Homer ''Odyssey'' Book IV&lt;/ref&gt;

Telemachus focuses on his father's return to Ithaca in Book XV.  He visits [[Eumaeus]], the swineherd, who happens to be hosting a disguised Odysseus.  After Odysseus reveals himself to Telemachus due to Athena's advice, the two men plan the downfall of the suitors. Telemachus then returns to the palace to keep an eye on the suitors and to await his father as the beggar.&lt;ref&gt;Homer, ''Odyssey'' Books XV–XVI&lt;/ref&gt;

When Penelope challenges the suitors to string Odysseus' bow and shoot an arrow through the handle-holes of twelve axeheads, Telemachus is the first to attempt the task. He would have completed the task, nearly stringing the bow on his fourth attempt; however, Odysseus subtly stops him before he can finish his attempt. Following the suitors' failure at this task, Odysseus reveals himself and he and Telemachus bring swift and bloody death to the suitors.&lt;ref&gt;Homer, ''Odyssey'' Books XXI–XXII&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Telegony''==
The ''[[Telegony]]'' was a short two-book epic poem recounting the life and death of Odysseus after the events of the ''Odyssey''. In this mythological postscript, Odysseus is accidentally killed by [[Telegonus]], his unknown son by the goddess [[Circe]]. After Odysseus' death, Telemachus returns to [[Aeaea]] with Telegonus and Penelope, and there marries Circe.

From the ''[[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]]'':{{full citation needed|date=September 2018}}&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Telemachus''': The son of Odysseus and Penelope (Hom. Od. i. 216). He was still an infant at the time when his father went to Troy, and in his absence of nearly twenty years he grew up to manhood. After the gods in council had determined that Odysseus should return home from the island of Ogygia, Athena, assuming the appearance of Mentes, king of the Taphians, went to Ithaca, and advised Telemachus to eject the troublesome suitors of his mother from his house, and to go to Pylos and Sparta, to gather information concerning his father. Telemachus followed the advice, but the suitors refused to quit his house; and Athena, in the form of Mentes, accompanied Telemachus to Pylos. There they were hospitably received by Nestor, who also sent his own son to conduct Telemachus to Sparta. Menelaus again kindly received him, and communicated to him the prophecy of Proteus concerning Odysseus (Hom. Od. i.–iv.).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Sparta Telemachus returned home; and on his arrival there, he found his father, with the swineherd Eumaeus. But as Athena had metamorphosed him into a beggar, Telemachus did not recognise his father until the latter disclosed to him who he was. Father and son now agreed to punish the suitors; and when they were slain or dispersed, Telemachus accompanied his father to the aged Laertes. (Hom. Od. xv.–xxiv.; comp. Odysseus.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the post-Homeric traditions, we read that Palamedes, when endeavouring to persuade Odysseus to join the Greeks against Troy, and the latter feigned idiocy, placed the infant Telemachus before the plough with which Odysseus was ploughing (Hygin. Fab. 95; Serv. ad Aen. ii. 81; Tzetz. ad Lycoph. 384; Aelian, V. H. xiii. 12.).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;According to some accounts, Telemachus became the father of Perseptolis either by [[Polycaste]], the daughter of [[Nestor (mythology)|Nestor]], or by [[Nausicaa]], the daughter of Alcinous (Eustath. ad Hom. p. 1796; Dict. Cret. vi. 6.). Others relate that he was induced by Athena to marry Circe, and became by her the father of [[Latinus]] (Hygin. Fab. 127; comp. Telegonus), or that he married Cassiphone, a daughter of Circe, but in a quarrel with his mother-in-law he slew her, for which in his turn he was killed by Cassiphone (Tzetz. ad Lycoph. 808.). He is also said to have had a daughter called Roma, who married [[Aeneas]] (Serv. ad Aen. i. 273.).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One account states that Odysseus, in consequence of a prophecy that his son was dangerous to him, sent him away from Ithaca. Servius (ad Aen. x. 167) makes Telemachus the founder of the town of Clusium in Etruria.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Later classical authors==
In ''[[Contest of Homer and Hesiod]]'', it is alleged that the Roman Emperor [[Hadrian]] asked the [[Delphic Oracle]] about Homer's birthplace and parentage. The Oracle replied that Homer came from Ithaca and that Telemachus was his father by [[Epicasta]], daughter of Nestor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://omacl.org/Hesiod/homrhes.html "Hesiod, The Homeric Hymns, and Homerica"] (''[[Contest of Homer and Hesiod]]'')&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Herbert William|last=Parke|title=Greek Oracles|year=1967|pages=136–137 citing the ''[[Contest of Homer and Hesiod|Certamen]]'', 12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Aristotle]] and [[Dictys of Crete]], Telemachus married [[Nausicaa]], King Alcinous' daughter, and fathered a son named Perseptolis or Ptoliporthus.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}

==Other appearances==
Telemachus is the subject of [[François Fénelon]]'s ''[[Les Aventures de Télémaque|The Adventures of Telemachus, Son of Ulysses]]'' (1699), a scathing attack on the [[monarchy]] of France.

Telemachus was the subject of numerous [[opera]]s throughout the eighteenth century, most based on Fénelon's version.&lt;ref&gt;{{GroveOnline|title=Telemachus|author=Dale E. Monson|access-date=January 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the most famous of these operas were [[André Cardinal Destouches]]'s ''[[Télémaque (Destouches)|Télémaque]]'' (1714), [[Alessandro Scarlatti]]'s ''[[Telemaco (Scarlatti)|Telemaco]]'' (1718), Gluck's ''[[Telemaco (Gluck)|Telemaco, ossia L'isola di Circe]]'' (1765), [[Giuseppe Gazzaniga]]'s ''Gli errori di Telemaco'' (1776), [[Jean-François Le Sueur]]'s ''Télémaque dans l'île de Calypso ou Le triomphe de la sagesse'' (1796), [[Simon Mayr]]'s ''[[Telemaco (Mayr)|Telemaco nell'isola di Calipso]]'' (1797), and Fernando Sor's ''[[Telemaco (Sor)|Telemaco nell'isola di Calipso]]'' (1797).

Telemachus is one of the main characters in ''Ulysses'', a 1706 play by [[Nicholas Rowe (writer)|Nicholas Rowe]].

Telemachus is featured in the 1833 poem (published in 1842) "[[Ulysses (poem)|Ulysses]]" by [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]].

In the 1922 novel ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' by [[James Joyce]], [[Stephen Dedalus]] is generally regarded as corresponding to Telemachus.

"Telemachus" is the title of Book Three of [[Thomas Wolfe]]'s autobiographical novel ''[[Of Time and the River]]'' (1935).

[[Joseph Brodsky]] published the poem "Odysseus to Telemachus" in 1972.

Telemachus is a frequent character in the poetry of [[Louise Glück]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baymoon.com/~ariadne/poets/louise.gluck.htm ''Meadowlands'' (1996), summary]&lt;/ref&gt;

Telemachus was the name of [[Carole King]]'s cat and is pictured on the cover of her album ''[[Tapestry (Carole King album)|Tapestry]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/journalists/helen-brown/5201808/Carole-King-interview.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Telemachus appears as the son of Ulysses in the 1981 French-Japanese animated television series ''[[Ulysses 31]]''.

Telemachus is a major character in Madeline Miller's novel ''Circe''.  He eventually marries and has children with Circe.

Telemachus is the title of a poem by American poet Ocean Vuong &lt;ref&gt;http://www.forwardartsfoundation.org/poetry/telemachus/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Triplemanía II-A''' a major ''[[lucha libre]]'', or [[professional wrestling]] event [[Asistencia Asesoría y Administración]] (AAA) that took place at the [[Aguascalientes, Aguascalientes|Aguascalientes]] baseball stadium on April 26, 1994. The show was the first of three Triplemanía II shows held in 1994 with two subsequent shows held in May. 1994 was the first year AAA held multiple Triplemanía shows in a year, a tradition they would continue through 1997, after which Triplemanía became a single annual event. The annual Triplemanía show(s) are AAA's biggest show of the year, serving as the culmination of major storylines and feature wrestlers from all over the world competing in what has been described as AAA's version of [[WrestleMania]] or their [[Super Bowl]] event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Madigan, Dan|title=Mondo Lucha Libre: the bizarre and honorable world of wild Mexican wrestling|publisher=HarperColins Publisher|year=2007|chapter=A family affair|pages=128–132|isbn=978-0-06-085583-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the main event of the first Triplemanía II show was a ''[[Lucha de Apuestas]]'', or bet match, where both [[Heavy Metal (wrestler)|Heavy Metal]] and [[Jerry Estrada]] "bet" their hair on the outcome of the match. The main event originally ended in a disqualification loss for Heavy Metal, which seemed like he was going to be shaved bald. Moments later AAA owner and booker [[Antonio Peña]] came to ringside and restarted the match, with Heavy Metal winning the match and the hair of Jerry Estrada. On the under-card the team known as ''[[Los Payasos]]'' (Spanish for "The Clowns"; Coco Rojo, Coco Verde and Coco Amarillo) defeated ''[[Capos (professional wrestling)|Los Hermanos Dinamita]]'' ([[Cien Caras]], [[Máscara Año 2000]] and [[Universo 2000]]) to win the [[Mexican National Trios Championship]]. The show featured six additional matches with AAA wrestlers as well as the Japanese [[Tiger Mask III]] from [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]].

==Production==
===Background===
AAA founder [[Antonio Peña]] had originally envisioned the [[Triplemanía]] series as three shows held over the summer, but for the first year AAA only held 1 show, [[Triplemanía I]]. In 1994 AAA announced that they would hold three Triplemanía shows, building the storylines into its climax at the third and final Triplemanía II show. The first Triplemanía II show would take place in the outdoor baseball stadium in [[Aguascalientes, Aguascalientes]] on April 26, the second show, ''[[Triplemanía II-B]]'', would be at the [[Estadio Olímpico Benito Juárez]] in [[Zapopan, Jalisco]] on May 15 and the third and final Triplemanía II show, [[Triplemanía II-C]],  would happen at the [[Plaza de Toros Monumental de Tijuana|El Toro]] [[bullfighting]] arena in [[Tijuana]], [[Baja California]] on May 27, 1994.&lt;ref name="Trip2"/&gt;&lt;ref name=TripleSlam&gt;{{cite web | url=http://slam.canoe.com/SlamWrestlingInternational/triplemania.html | title=TripleMania: Mexico's answer to WrestleMania | first=John F. | last=Molinaro | year=2000 | accessdate=June 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Trip2B"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/mexico/aaa/triple.html#ii-b | title = Asistencia Asesoría y Administración TripleManía | accessdate = 2009-02-19| publisher = ProWrestlingHistory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Trip2C"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/mexico/aaa/triple.html#ii-c | title = Asistencia Asesoría y Administración TripleManía | accessdate = 2009-02-19| publisher = ProWrestlingHistory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peña decided that [[Konnan]] and [[Jake Roberts]], who were slated to main event Triplemanía II-C would not face off at Triplemanía II-A, making it more special when they actually fought on the later Triplemanía shows.&lt;ref name=TripleSlam/&gt;&lt;ref name=YIR1994/&gt;

===Storylines===
[[File:Octagón.jpg|thumb|left|[[Octagón]], teamed with [[El Hijo del Santo]] and [[Perro Aguayo]] to defeat ''[[Los Gringos Locos]]''.]]
The Triplemanía show featured eight [[Professional wrestling match types|professional wrestling matches]] with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing [[Screenplay|scripted]] feuds, [[plot (narrative)|plots]] and [[narrative thread|storylines]]. Wrestlers were portrayed as either [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heels]] (referred to as ''rudos'' in Mexico, those that portray the "bad guys") or [[Face (professional wrestling)|faces]] (''técnicos'' in Mexico, the "good guy" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.

==Event==
During the fifth match of the night cameras showed wrestlers [[Miguel Pérez, Jr.]] and Chicano Power in the crowd, holding up a Puerto Rican flag while heckling Konnan. At one point during the match Konnan's partner [[Máscara Sagrada]] had to prevent him from jumping into the crowd to go after the two heckling wrestlers.

==Aftermath==
AAA's main storyline post Triplemanía II-A and for more or less the entire year that followed was ''Los Gringos Locos'' and their storyline war with all of AAA. The next chapter came at Triplemanía II-B where Black Cat was unmasked after losing a ''Lucha de Apuestas'' to [[Máscara Sagrada]]. The main event of Triplemanía II-B saw Miguel Pérez Jr. debut as part of ''Los Gringos Locos'', following up on his appearance in the crowd during Triplemanía II-A. Pérez, Roberts and Love Machine would lose to Konnan, Aguayo and Cien Caras.&lt;ref name="Trip2"/&gt; That match served as a preview to Triplemanía II-C's main event between Konnan and Jake Roberts where Konnan finally ended the storyline with Roberts that had started a year earlier.&lt;ref name="Trip2C"/&gt; The ''Los Gringos Locos'' storyline carried AAA into their subsequent major shows "Night of Champions" and later on their first ever [[pay-per-view]] (PPV) [[AAA When Worlds Collide]] that was driven by the feud between ''a Pareja del Terror'' ([[Eddy Guerrero]] and [[Art Barr|Love Machine]]) facing off against El Hijo del Santo and Octagón in a ''Luchas de Apuestas'' match where Guerrero and Love Machine ended up losing their hair.&lt;ref name="AlmanacWorlds"&gt;{{cite news|title=Historical Cards|work=PWI Presents: 2007 Wrestling Almanak and book of facts|publisher=Kappa Publications|id=2007 Edition|page=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; 19 days afterwards Love Machine, real name Art Barr, dies of unknown causes.&lt;ref name=BarrRemembered&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.com/WrestlingStarBios/barr_art.html |title=Art Barr: What could have been; Looking back at Love Machine's career|last=Molinaro|first=John|accessdate=2008-10-12|work=Slam! Sports|publisher=[[Canadian Online Explorer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popularity of Konnan in the wake of his victory over Jake Robers made his turn to the ''rudo'' side months later ever more shocking, with Konnan attacking his longtime friend Perro Aguayo during a match and joining ''Los Gringos Locos'' instead.&lt;ref name=AAAOficial&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.luchalibreaaa.com/historia/when-worlds-collide.html | title= El evento que comenzo la revolucion mundial | publisher=[[Asistencia Asesoría y Administración]] | accessdate=June 27, 2015 | language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; As When Worlds Collide Aguayo defeated Konnan in a [[steel cage match]].&lt;ref name="AlmanacWorlds"/&gt;

''Los Payasos'' winning the Mexican National Trios Championship would be one of the last victories in the trios' "Undefeated Streak"&lt;ref group=Note&gt;The wrestlers who played ''Los Payasos'' had lost several times in their previous identities, but AAA had booked them to win every single match they had up until this point.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Los Payasos'' lost the Mexican National Trios Championship to the team of [[Ángel Azteca]], El Hijo del Santo and [[Super Muñeco]] on May 22, 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Royal Duncan and Gary Will | title=Wrestling Title Histories | publisher=Archeus Communications | chapter = Mexico: National Trios Title | page = 393 | year= 2000 | isbn=0-9698161-5-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Lucha 2000 Staff | title = Los Reyes de Mexico: La Historia de Los Campeonatos Nacionales | work =Lucha 2000 | id = Especial 21 | date = December 20, 2004 | language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Los Payasos'' and ''Los Hermanos Dinamita'' in what became a non-title rematch at Triplemanía II-C which tool place inside a steel cage match. At the show ''Los Hermanos Dinamita'' were able to hand ''Los Payasos their second loss ever.&lt;ref name="Trip2C"/&gt;

NJPW representative Tiger Mask III also competed at the next Triplemanía II show, teaming with fellow NJPW representative [[Jushin Thunder Liger]] and AAA representatives El Hijo del Santo and Octagón, defeating the team of [[La Parka]], [[Psicosis]], Blue Panther, and Eddy Guerrero at Triplemanía II-B&lt;ref name="Trip2B"/&gt; Afterwards Tiger Mask II and Jushin Thunder Liger returned to Japan but AAA and NJPW would work together repeatedly over the years until NJPW began partnering with [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] (CMLL) in Mexico. At that point AAA began working with both [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]] and [[Pro Wrestling Noah]] and has toured Japan on more than one occasion.

==Reception==
John Molinario, who writes about wrestling for the [[Canadian Online Explorer]], wrote that the main event ''Lucha de Apuestas'' match was considered the best match on the show and stated that "Fans and critics were blown away by the show, thinking that there was no way the remaining two shows could possibly match its quality".&lt;ref name=TripleSlam/&gt;

[[Tasmania]] has been since it was settled by Europeans, traversed in many ways, and in most cases un-recorded.

In the twenty-first century, some people have created and recorded their journeys around the island as 'events' for publicity and fund raising, with most [[Walking|walks]] mentioned here in the latter category.

A north–south crossing of [[Australia]] may also include walking around Tasmania, known as a 'traversal crossing'.

Historically, the sheer volume of people walking or traversing the island in a number of ways is not traceable.  Some noted nineteenth-century ventures around the island before proper roads included such ventures of the walks of [[Thomas Bather Moore]] and the [[Walk to the West]], which involved substantial logistic issues due to terrain and lack of support.

==Twenty-first-century ventures==
The claims of these ventures in no way should be considered 'firsts', as in most cases earlier walks of substantially more difficult circumstances were never recorded in this manner.  Also most walks and walkers are on made roads.

===Christopher and Kelvyn Linton===
Kelvyn Charles Yong-Hyeon Linton and his father Christopher Neil Linton walked across Tasmania, in 2015 to raise funds for [[mood disorders]]. They [[backpacking (travel)|backpacked]] the entire coastal route, although they did accept some offers of food and hospitality along the way. Kelvyn was 14 years old at the time, making him the youngest person to have walked across Tasmania, at that time. This was also the first father-son team to complete the journey.&lt;ref name=Kelvyn1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themercury.com.au/news/tasmania/kelvyn-steps-up-for-good-with-epic-walk-across-tasmania/story-fnj4f7k1-1227312720138|title=Kelvyn steps up for good with epic walk across Tasmania|work=Mercury|accessdate=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father went on to complete a walk around the perimeter of Tasmania, becoming the first person to do so.&lt;ref name=nearend&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themercury.com.au/news/tasmania/chris-linton-nears-end-of-walk-around-tasmanias-perimeter/story-fnj4f7k1-1227351866303|title=Chris Linton nears end of walk around Tasmania’s perimeter|work=Mercury|accessdate=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bluesbeater /&gt;&lt;ref name=bidshift /&gt;&lt;ref name=veterans /&gt;&lt;ref name=stepatatime /&gt;&lt;ref name=finalstint /&gt;&lt;ref name=triumph/&gt;&lt;ref name="nearend"/&gt;&lt;ref name=bluesbeater&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themercury.com.au/news/tasmania/epic-blues-beater-puts-dad-on-the-map/story-fnj4f7k1-1227357590621|title=Epic blues-beater puts dad on the map|work=Mercury|accessdate=17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bidshift&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theadvocate.com.au/story/3024364/opening-up-in-bid-for-shift/|title=Opening up in bid for shift|author=Fairfax Regional Media|date=20 April 2015|work=The Advocate|accessdate=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=veterans&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theadvocate.com.au/story/3033211/walkers-pause-to-reflect-on-difficulties-for-veterans/|title=Walkers pause to reflect on difficulties for veterans|author=Fairfax Regional Media|date=24 April 2015|work=The Advocate|accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=stepatatime&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theadvocate.com.au/story/3039674/tassie-a-step-at-a-time/|title=Tassie: a step at a time|author=Fairfax Regional Media|date=27 April 2015|work=The Advocate|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=finalstint&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theadvocate.com.au/story/3082517/final-stint-of-46-day-stroll/|title=Final stint of 46-day stroll|author=Fairfax Regional Media|date=15 May 2015|work=The Advocate|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=triumph&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theadvocate.com.au/story/3084816/walk-triumph-for-father-son/?cs=86/|title=Walk triumph for father, son|author=Fairfax Regional Media|date=18 May 2015|work=The Advocate|accessdate=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hardy James "Jimmy" Harrington===
Hardy James "Jimmy" Harrington walked around [[Tasmania]], in 2014 to raise funds for child cancer. He left Melbourne on the [[Spirit of Tasmania]] to Devonport on 2 May, departing Devonport toward [[Hobart]] on 3 May. His route took him through Deloraine to [[Launceston, Tasmania|Launceston]], through the Epping Forest to Ross, to Oatlands, past Bagdad and into [[Hobart]] on 9 May. He then rested in Hobart a day then went back to Devonport and departed once again on the [[Spirit of Tasmania]] back to [[Melbourne]] (11 May). James was 20 years old at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/a-16000-kilometre-walk-to-support-sick-children-20140408-36bf0.html/|title=A 16,000 kilometre walk to support sick children|author=Ian Waden|date= 9 April 2014|work=ACT News|accessdate= 22 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===John Olsen===
John Olsen has walked across Australia twice, between the northern and southern-most points, and the western and eastern-most points. His first crossing included crossing Tasmania.

His first journey commenced in 2004. John walked 5,622&amp;nbsp;km unsupported from [[Cape York Peninsula|Cape York]] to [[Tasmania]] in 167 days, and raised a little over $10,000 for a charity working with children with [[cerebral palsy]]. On 18 June 2008, John Olsen undertook his second walk, walking from [[Steep Point]], to [[Cape Byron]]. He travelled a distance 4752&amp;nbsp;km, raising $130,000 for the Australian Lions Children’s Mobility Foundation (ALCMF) and the Australian Leukodystrophy Support Group Inc (ALDS).&lt;ref name = "john_olsen1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Northern Star|title=John Olsen's last leg of epic Aussie charity walk|url=http://www.northernstar.com.au/story/2008/11/27/last-leg-walk-across-oz/|date=27 November 2008|accessdate=2011-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The disparity in distance is due to John walking back to his home in [[Geelong]] after reaching [[Cape Byron]]. Both the ALCMF and ALDS help children with progressive degenerative brain disease, which gives rise to mobility problems. The progress of John’s second journey was broadcast by Ian McNamara’s ABC radio’s ‘Australia All Over’ program on Sundays. John completed the walk in 200 days, finishing on 3 January 2009.&lt;ref name="john_olsen2"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lions Club Australia|title=Lions Club Australia Monthly Newsletter - Volume 32, Issue 8, p5-6.|url=http://www.lionsclubs.org.au/201v5/Lions_Newsletter1_March%202009.pdf|date=1 March 2009|accessdate=2011-03-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726112052/http://www.lionsclubs.org.au/201v5/Lions_Newsletter1_March%202009.pdf|archivedate=26 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John’s accomplishment was recognised by Sensis when they depicted him on the cover of the local (Geelong and Colac) Yellow and White Pages directories for 2010/2011&lt;ref name = "john_olsen3"&gt;{{cite web|last=Telstra Corporation Ltd|title=Courageous Australian John Olsen to feature on Geelong's Yellow Pages and White Pages|url=http://www.whitepagescommunity.com.au/content/courageous-australian-john-olsen-feature-geelongs-yellow-pages%C2%AE-and-white-pages%C2%AE|date=10 March 2010|accessdate=2011-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Andrew "Cad" Cadigan===
Andrew "Cad" Cadigan finished a solo walk from Sydney back to Sydney in June 2012. He walked unassisted via Tasmania, Melbourne, Adelaide, Albany, Perth, Broome, Darwin, Townsville, and Brisbane. Cadigan undertook the walk in honour of Chris Simpson, a friend who had died from complications related to [[Myelodysplastic syndrome|myelodysplasia]], and raised over $65,000 - $25,000 for [[Cancer Council Australia|The Cancer Council]] and $40,000 for the Leukemia Foundation. Shortly after completing the walk, whilst holidaying and recuperating in Thailand, Cadigan suffered head injuries in a motorcycle accident, and later died in hospital in Sydney, on 5 October 2012. A book, written by his author father Neil, about his walk and tragic death was released in 2014. The Leukemia Foundation has struck a research PHD into myelodysplasia, named in honour of Cadigan and Simpson, with a trust called Cad's Cause continuing to raise funds.&lt;ref name = "cad1"&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=|title=ozonfoot.com|url=http://www.ozonfoot.com/|date=|accessdate=2011-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "cad2"&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=|title=Cancer Council Fundraising - Oz on foot|url=http://nsw.cancercouncilfundraising.org.au/personalPage.aspx?SID=366404&amp;Lang=en-CA|date=|accessdate=2011-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "cad3"&gt;{{cite web|last=Transcontinental News|title=Lone wanderer walks for his mate 'Simmo'|url=http://www.ozonfoot.com/picture_library/documents/20110428__Trans%20Continental,%20Pt%20Augusta.pdf|date=27 April 2011|accessdate=2011-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "cad4"&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=|title=Across Australia on foot|url=http://blogs.abc.net.au/sa/2011/05/across-australia-on-foot.html?site=northandwest&amp;program=north_and_west_sa_weekends|date=12 May 2001|accessdate=2011-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wallace|first=Morgaine|title=Andrew Cadigan in Port Pirie|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHJAybNJCVo|publisher=Southern Cross News|accessdate=14 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ozonfoot.com/cgi-bin/home.cgi "Oz on foot"], ''SportSites''.

===Colin Ricketts===
Colin Ricketts walked around Australia raising money for kids with cancer. He departed [[Adelaide]] on 4 January 2005, returning 15,430&amp;nbsp;km and 379 days later on 17 January 2006. He pushed a three-wheel baby-jogger named 'Wilson' and followed [[Highway 1 (Australia)|National Highway 1]] in an anti-clockwise direction. Colin incorporated a Tasmania crossing from Hobart to Devonport as part of his walk.&lt;ref name="ricketts1"&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=|title=Start a New Life|url=http://www.startanewlife.com.au/|date=n.d.|accessdate=2011-04-04|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110220154933/http://startanewlife.com.au/|archivedate=20 February 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Victorian Rally Championship''' was the [[Evolution (term)|evolution]] series of [[Rallying|car rallies]] in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria, Australia]].  Prior to 1972, car rallies/trials relied heavily on the ability of a [[navigator]] to read a [[map]] and direct their [[Driving|driver]] over a planned [[Course (navigation)|course]] covering [[shire]] [[road]]s and [[forest]] tracks at [[night]].

In 1972 the series evolved in line with the improvement of [[forest track]]s, and the [[population]] of properties along Shire roads – into a more driver-oriented [[sporting event|event]].

Route instructions became comprehensive, making it easier for a crew to avoid getting lost, and results were effectively determined by how fast the drivers drove on the generally narrow [[forest road]]s.

Since 1990, many of these events have been held during [[daylight]] [[hour]]s – making the [[competition]] more attractive to [[Spectator sport|spectators]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2473">'''Whoop-Up Days''' is an annual non-profit [[festival]], [[fair|exhibition]] and [[rodeo]] held in [[Lethbridge]], [[Alberta]], for five days in the last full week of August.

The event includes a 4-km parade through [[Downtown Lethbridge|downtown]], daily concerts, bull riding, a rodeo, an indoor and outdoor trade show, entertainment on the free stage, a [[Midway (fair)|midway]], HobbyWorld and citywide [[pancake]] breakfasts. In 2007, a record-breaking attendance at the event numbered 69,964. The previous record was set in 2006 when 67,590 visitors attended.

Economic impact from the fair amounts to roughly $2.5 million spent by event operations, locals and 13,000 visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Location==
Whoop-Up Days takes place at the [[Exhibition Park (Lethbridge)|Exhibition Park]], which is on the eastern edge of the city. Permanent structures at the site include a 10,664 m² (114,787&amp;nbsp;ft²) pavilion complex (main, north, west and south pavilions, and Saddle Room), Heritage Hall, Pioneer Park, a grandstand, and a racetrack.

==History==
The first fair was held on 5 October 1897 at the agricultural grounds in Queen Victoria Park (renamed in 1955 to Gyro Park). It included stage presentations, traveling shows and horse racing.

In 1904, eight years before the [[Calgary Stampede]], the first large-scale rodeo was staged as part of Whoop-Up Days.

In 1912, the festival was moved to its current location east of [[Henderson Park (Lethbridge)|Henderson Park]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2956">'''Willard Fuller''' (1915-2009) was an American [[Faith healing|faith healer]] and proponent of psychic dentistry.&lt;ref name="Nickell 1993"&gt;[[Joe Nickell|Nickell, Joe]]. (1993). ''Looking for a Miracle: Weeping Icons, Relics, Stigmata, Visions &amp; Healing Cures''. Prometheus Books. pp. 141-142. {{ISBN|1-57392-680-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

Fuller was born in [[Grant Parish, Louisiana]]. In 1946 he graduated in [[theology]] at the [[Southern Baptist Theological Seminary]]. He formed his own healing ministry known as the Lively Stones World Healing Fellowship.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3403801837.html "Willard Fuller"]. ''Encyclopedia of Occultism and Parapsychology''. (2001). 20 July, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; He worked in [[Palatka, Florida]].&lt;ref name="Nickell 1993"/&gt;

It was alleged that Fuller could cause [[Dental restoration|dental filling]]s to appear spontaneously, change silver into golden fillings, straighten crooked teeth or produce new teeth. However, [[Magic (illusion)|magicians]] and skeptics have found these claims dubious, unsupported by any solid evidence. One dentist examined some patients of Fuller. In one case miraculous gold fillings turned out to be [[tobacco]] stains. In another case a female patient who reported a miraculous new silver filling admitted she had forgotten that the filling was already there.&lt;ref name="Nickell 1993"/&gt;

Science writer Kurt Butler has written:

&lt;blockquote&gt;As explained by James Randi in ''The Faith Healers'', he convinces many that the miracles happen because people aren't very observant about their own teeth, regular amalgam can appear yellowish with a dim flashlight, and because they want to believe. When they later realize that no miracle occurred, Fuller's circus has left town or they are too embarrassed to complain, or they blame their lack of faith for the fading and erasure of the miracle."&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Kurt. (1999). ''Lying for Fun and Profit: The Truth about the Media : Exposes the Corrupt Symbiosis Between Media Giants and the Health Fraud Industries''. Health Wise Productions. pp. 100-101. {{ISBN|978-0967328102}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Fuller was once convicted of fraud in [[Australia]] for practicing dentistry without a license.&lt;ref name="Nickell 1993"/&gt;

Science writer [[Terence Hines]] has written that Fuller was "nothing more than a practitioner of sleight of hand."&lt;ref&gt;[[Terence Hines|Hines, Terence]]. (2003). ''Psychic Surgery''. In ''Pseudoscience and the Paranormal''. Prometheus Books. {{ISBN|1-57392-979-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rear Admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] '''William Reynolds Purnell''' (6 September 1886 – 3 March 1955) was an officer in the [[United States Navy]] who served in [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. A 1908 graduate of the [[United States Naval Academy]], he captained destroyers during World War I. He was awarded the [[Navy Cross (United States)|Navy Cross]] for his role in protecting convoys against German submarines as commander of the  {{USS|Lamson|DD-18|6}}.

He was promoted to [[Rear Admiral (United States)|rear admiral]] in November 1941. During World War II, he was chief of staff of the ill-fated [[Asiatic Fleet]] at the start of the [[Pacific War]]. He later served as Assistant [[Chief of Naval Operations]] for Materiel. He was the navy representative on the Joint Committee on New Weapons and Equipment, and, from September 1942, the navy representative on the Military Policy Committee, the three-man committee that oversaw the [[Manhattan Project]].  Purnell helped coordinate its activities with those of the navy. In 1945, he travelled to [[Tinian]] as the representative of the Military Policy Committee, and coordinated preparations for the [[atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] with senior army and navy commanders in the Pacific. He retired from the navy in 1946 and died in 1955.

== Early life ==
William Reynolds Purnell was born in [[Bowling Green, Missouri]], on 6 September 1886.{{sfn|Ancell|Miller|1996|p=596}} In 1908, he graduated from the [[United States Naval Academy]] at [[Annapolis]]. He was commissioned as an [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]] in 1910. During [[World War I]], he commanded the [[destroyer]]s {{USS|Lamson|DD-18|6}}, {{USS|Patterson|DD-36|6}}, {{USS|Rowan|DD-64|6}}, and {{USS|Montgomery|DD-121|6}}.{{sfn|Ancell|Miller|1996|p=596}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/r9/rowan-ii.htm |title=Rowan |publisher=United States Navy |accessdate=8 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For his services, he was awarded the [[Navy Cross (United States)|Navy Cross]]. His citation read:{{quote|The President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting the Navy Cross to Lieutenant Commander William Reynolds Purnell, United States Navy, for distinguished service in the line of his profession as commanding officer of the USS ''Lamson'', engaged in the important, exacting and hazardous duty of patrolling the waters infested with enemy submarines and mines, in escorting and protecting vitally important convoys of troops and supplies through these waters, and in offensive and defensive action, vigorously and unremittingly prosecuted against all forms of enemy naval activity during World War I.&lt;ref name="Navy Cross"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://projects.militarytimes.com/citations-medals-awards/recipient.php?recipientid=10334 |publisher=Military Times |title=Valor Awards for William Reynolds Purnell |accessdate=8 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

In January 1917, while he was serving on the ''Rowan'', he married Ada Dodge Curtiss, the daughter of Walter Phelps Dodge and the ex-wife of Gerald S. Curtiss. They had one son, William Reynolds Purnell, Jr.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

After the war, he commanded the [[tanker (ship)|tanker]] {{USS|Cuyama|AO-3|6}} from 1934 to 1936. Alternating duty afloat with service ashore, he then became secretary to the [[General Board]]. He commanded the [[cruiser]] {{USS|New Orleans|CA-32|6}} from January to December 1939.{{sfn|Ancell|Miller|1996|p=596}}

== World War II ==
Purnell became Chief of Staff of [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] [[Thomas C. Hart]]'s  [[Asiatic Fleet]].{{sfn|Ancell|Miller|1996|p=596}} Purnell represented the United States at a planning conference in Singapore in April 1941 at which American, British, Dutch, Australian, and New Zealand commanders attempted to coordinate their plans for an increasingly likely war with Japan.{{sfn|Morison|1948|pp=53–55}} He was promoted to [[Rear Admiral (United States)|rear admiral]] in November 1941.{{sfn|Ancell|Miller|1996|p=596}} On 7 December, Purnell played golf with Hart. War broke out the next morning.{{sfn|Morison|1948|pp=168–169}} The Japanese advanced quickly and the Asiatic Fleet moved from the Philippines to Java in January.{{sfn|Morison|1948|p=277}} As the Japanese closed in on Java, Purnell flew to [[Broome, Western Australia|Broome]] on 25 February.{{sfn|Morison|1948|p=337}}

In Australia, Purnell became chief of staff to Vice Admiral [[William A. Glassford]], the commander of US Naval Forces, [[South West Pacific Area (command)|Southwest Pacific]]. When Glassford departed in May 1942, Purnell took his place. He too left Australia in June 1942, for duty in Washington, D.C., in the Office of the Commander in Chief, [[United States Fleet]], Admiral [[Ernest J. King]].{{sfn|Ancell|Miller|1996|p=596}} For his services, he was awarded the [[Navy Distinguished Service Medal]]. His citation read:{{quote|The President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Navy Distinguished Service Medal to Rear Admiral William Reynolds Purnell, United States Navy, for especially meritorious service as Chief of Staff to Commander in Chief, Asiatic Fleet, and Commander U.S. Forces, Southwest, Pacific, since the outbreak of war for duties involving great responsibility connected with formulation plans, counseling their application and aid in directing execution, especially of offensive missions of forces of this command which have resulted in substantial damage to the enemy together with skill and tact displayed in negotiating, conferring and dealing with commanders of the Allied Forces during World War II.&lt;ref name="Navy Cross"/&gt;}}

[[File:Three Tinian Joint Chiefs.jpg|thumb|300px|The "Tinian Joint Chiefs": Captain [[William S. Parsons]] (left), Rear Admiral William R. Purnell (center), and Brigadier General [[Thomas F. Farrell]] (right)]]
Purnell became Deputy [[Chief of Naval Operations]] for Materiel.{{sfn|Ancell|Miller|1996|p=596}} He was also the navy representative on the Joint Committee on New Weapons and Equipment, and, from September 1942, the navy representative on the Military Policy Committee, the three-man committee that oversaw the [[Manhattan Project]].{{sfn|Jones|1985|p=77}} Purnell helped coordinate the activities of the Manhattan Project with those of the navy, particularly the navy's [[Uranium enrichment#Thermal diffusion|thermal diffusion]] research,{{sfn|Jones|1985|p=174}} and he helped provide scientists and technicians from the navy for the project.{{sfn|Jones|1985|p=350}}

In February 1945, Purnell arranged for [[Commander]] [[Frederick Ashworth]] to go to [[Guam]] to brief [[Fleet Admiral]] [[Chester Nimitz]] on the project. He provided Ashworth with a letter from King stressing the project's importance and the need for secrecy. Ashworth selected a base site for the Manhattan Project's operations. He inspected facilities on Guam and [[Tinian]], and chose the latter.{{sfn|Groves|1962|pp=277–279}}

Tinian's harbor suffered from congestion due to extensive base development work, and ships sometimes took months to unload. The director of the Manhattan Project, [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[Leslie R. Groves, Jr.]], went to Purnell, who arranged for an order from King to Nimitz stating that all shipments related to the Manhattan Project and the [[509th Composite Group]] had to be unloaded immediately on arrival, regardless of the consequent disruption to the port's operations.{{sfn|Groves|1962|p=280}}{{sfn|Jones|1985|p=526}}

[[File:Awaiting the return of the Enola Gay 080125-f-3927s-045.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Purnell (center), [[General (United States)|General]] [[Carl Spaatz]] (second from right) and other dignitaries await the return of the ''[[Enola Gay]]'' and her crew from the [[bombing of Hiroshima|mission to Hiroshima]] ]]
Problems like this underlined the value of having high-ranking officers on hand to deal with local commanders to make decisions on the spot if necessary. In drawing up an organization for command of the Manhattan Project's operations, Groves and Purnell agreed that Purnell should to be present on Tinian as both the representative of the Military Policy Committee and the personal representative of Admiral King. He was joined by [[Brigadier General (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[Thomas F. Farrell]], the Manhattan Project's Deputy for Operations, and the two shared responsibility for coordinating the Manhattan Project's activities with the senior army and navy commanders in the Pacific.{{sfn|Groves|1962|p=311}} Along with Captain [[William S. Parsons]], the director of [[Project Alberta]], they formed what became informally known as the "Tinian Joint Chiefs".{{sfn|Christman|1998|p=176}}

Purnell was the first proponent of the idea that two atomic attacks, one following quickly after the other, would be required to end the war. This was something that Groves and Purnell discussed a number of times. "I knew that with him and Farrell on the ground at Tinian," Groves wrote. "There would be no unnecessary delay in exploiting our success"{{sfn|Groves|1962|p=342}} after the [[bombing of Hiroshima]]. The main difficulty with the second mission, then scheduled for 11 August, was the weather, which was predicted to be good until 9 August but bad for at least five days starting on 10 August. Parsons agreed to work the assembly team around the clock to get the [[Fat Man]] bomb ready by the evening of 8 August.{{sfn|Jones|1985|p=538}}

Before [[Major]] [[Charles Sweeney]] took off on the mission, Purnell took him aside and asked him if he knew how much the bomb cost.{{sfn|Groves|1962|p=344}} Sweeney did not know; Purnell told him it was about $2 billion. He then asked if Sweeney knew how much his aircraft was worth. This Sweeney did know; over half a million dollars. Purnell then told him: "I'd suggest you keep those relative values in mind for this mission."{{sfn|Sweeney|Antonucci|Antonucci|1997|p=200}}

== Later life ==
After the war, Purnell served as a member of the Army-Navy Evaluation Board during [[Operation Crossroads]].&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; He retired from the navy in October 1946,{{sfn|Ancell|Miller|1996|p=596}} and moved to [[Palo Alto, California]], where he died on 5 March 1955.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; He was buried in [[Golden Gate National Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.locategrave.org/l/433608/William-Reynolds-Purnell-CA |title=William Reynolds Purnell |publisher= FindTheBest.com |accessdate=8 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was survived by his wife, Ada Dodge Purnell, and his son, William R.

'''World War&amp;nbsp;II''' (often abbreviated to '''WWII''' or '''WW2'''), also known as the '''Second World War''', was a [[World war|global war]] that lasted from 1939 to 1945. [[World War II by country|The vast majority of the world's countries]]—including all the [[great power]]s—eventually formed two opposing [[military alliance]]s: the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] and the [[Axis powers|Axis]]. A state of [[total war]] emerged, directly involving more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. The major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the [[war effort]], blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources. World War II was the [[List of wars by death toll|deadliest conflict]] in human history, marked by 50 to 85 million fatalities, most of whom were civilians in the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|China]]. It included [[massacre]]s, the [[genocide]] of [[the Holocaust]], [[Strategic bombing during World War II|strategic bombing]], premeditated death from [[starvation]] and disease, and the only use of [[nuclear weapon]]s in war.{{sfn|Gilbert|2001|p=291}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=War, Violence, and Population: Making the Body Count |author=James A.

[[Empire of Japan|Japan]], which [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere|aimed to dominate]] [[Asia]] and the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]], was [[Second Sino-Japanese War|at war]] with China by 1937,{{sfn|Barrett|Shyu|2001|p=6}}{{efn|Although open hostilities existed between Japan and China from 1937, neither belligerent formally declared war on the other until after the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941.}} though neither side had [[declaration of war|declared war]] on the other. World War II is generally said to have begun on 1 September 1939,&lt;ref&gt;Axelrod, Alan (2007) ''Encyclopedia of World War II, Volume 1''. Infobase Publishing. pp. 659.&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[Invasion of Poland|invasion]] of [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] by [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] and subsequent declarations on Germany by [[French Third Republic|France]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. From late 1939 to early 1941, in a series of [[military campaign|campaign]]s and [[Tripartite Pact|treaties]], Germany conquered or controlled much of continental [[Europe]], and formed the Axis alliance with [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] and Japan. Under the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] of August 1939, Germany and the Soviet Union partitioned and annexed territories of their European neighbours, [[Soviet invasion of Poland|Poland]], [[Winter War|Finland]], [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|Romania]] and the [[Occupation of the Baltic states|Baltic states]]. Following the onset of campaigns in [[Western Desert Campaign|North Africa]] and [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East Africa]], and the [[Battle of France|fall of France]] in mid 1940, the war continued primarily between the European Axis powers and the [[British Empire]]. War in the [[Balkan Campaign (World War II)|Balkans]], the aerial [[Battle of Britain]], the [[The Blitz|Blitz]], and the long [[Battle of the Atlantic]] followed. On 22 June 1941, the European Axis powers launched [[Operation Barbarossa|an invasion of the Soviet Union]], opening the largest land theatre of war in history. This [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] trapped the Axis, most crucially the German [[Wehrmacht]], into a [[attrition warfare|war of attrition]]. In December 1941, Japan [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|launched a surprise attack]] on the [[United States]] and [[Japanese invasion of Malaya|European colonies]] in the Pacific Ocean. Following an immediate U.S. declaration of war against Japan, supported by one from Great Britain, the European Axis powers quickly declared war on the U.S. in solidarity with their Japanese ally. Rapid Japanese conquests over much of the Western Pacific ensued, perceived by many in Asia as liberation from Western dominance and resulting in the support of several armies from defeated territories.

The Axis advance in the Pacific halted in 1942 when Japan lost the critical [[Battle of Midway]]; later, Germany and Italy were [[Second Battle of El Alamein|defeated in North Africa]] and then, decisively, at [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]] in the Soviet Union. Key setbacks in 1943, which included a series of German defeats on the Eastern Front, the [[Allied invasion of Sicily|Allied invasions of Sicily]] and [[Allied invasion of Italy|Italy]], and Allied victories in the Pacific, cost the Axis its initiative and forced it into strategic retreat on all fronts. In 1944, the Western Allies [[Normandy landings|invaded German-occupied France]], while the Soviet Union regained its territorial losses and turned toward Germany and its allies. During 1944 and 1945 the Japanese suffered major reverses in mainland Asia in [[Second Guangxi Campaign|South]] [[Battle of West Hunan|Central China]] and [[Burma Campaign|Burma]], while the Allies crippled the [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Japanese Navy]] and captured key Western Pacific islands.

The war in Europe concluded with an [[Western Allied invasion of Germany|invasion of Germany]] by the Western Allies and the Soviet Union, culminating in the [[Battle of Berlin|capture of Berlin]] by Soviet troops, the [[Death of Adolf Hitler|suicide of Adolf Hitler]] and the [[German Instrument of Surrender|German unconditional surrender]] on [[Victory in Europe Day|8 May 1945]]. Following the [[Potsdam Declaration]] by the Allies on 26 July 1945 and the refusal of Japan to surrender under its terms, the United States [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|dropped atomic bombs]] on the Japanese cities of [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]] on 6 and 9 August respectively. With an [[Operation Downfall|invasion of the Japanese archipelago]] imminent, the possibility of additional atomic bombings, the Soviet entry into the war against Japan and its [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria|invasion of Manchuria]], Japan announced its intention to surrender on 15 August 1945, cementing total victory in Asia for the Allies. Tribunals were set up by fiat by the Allies and [[war crimes]] trials were conducted in the wake of the war both [[Nuremberg Trials|against the Germans]] and [[Japanese war crimes#War crimes trials|the Japanese]].

World War&amp;nbsp;II changed the political alignment and social structure of the globe. The [[United Nations]] (UN) was established to foster international co-operation and prevent future conflicts; the victorious [[great power|great powers]]—China, France, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States—became the [[Permanent members of the United Nations Security Council|permanent members]] of its [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]].&lt;ref name="The UN Security Council"&gt;{{Citation|title=The UN Security Council|url=http://www.unfoundation.org/what-we-do/issues/united-nations/the-un-security-council.html|accessdate=15 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet Union and United States emerged as rival [[superpower|superpowers]], setting the stage for the nearly half-century long [[Cold War]]. In the wake of European devastation, the influence of its great powers waned, triggering the [[decolonisation of Africa]] and [[Decolonisation of Asia|Asia]]. Most countries whose industries had been damaged moved towards [[Post–World War II economic expansion|economic recovery and expansion]]. Political integration, especially [[European integration|in Europe]], emerged as an effort to end pre-war enmities and create a common identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=From War to Peace: A European Tale|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2012/eu-lecture_en.html|publisher=Nobel Lecture by the European Union|accessdate=4 January 2014|author=Herman Van Rompuy, President of the European Council|author2=José Manuel Durão Barroso, President of the European Commission|date=10 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact date of the [[End of World War II in Asia|war's end]] is also not universally agreed upon. It was generally accepted at the time that the war ended with the [[armistice]] of 14 August 1945 ([[Victory over Japan Day|V-J Day]]), rather than the formal [[surrender of Japan]], which was on 2 September 1945 that officially [[End of World War II in Asia|ended the war in Asia]].

== Background ==
{{Main|Causes of World War II}}

=== Europe ===
[[World War I]] had radically altered the [[Geopolitics|political]] European map, with the defeat of the [[Central Powers]]—including [[Austria-Hungary]], [[German Empire|Germany]], [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]]—and the 1917 [[October Revolution|Bolshevik seizure of power]] in [[Russian Republic|Russia]], which eventually led to the founding of the [[Soviet Union]]. Meanwhile, the victorious [[Allies of World War I]], such as France, Belgium, Italy, Romania and Greece, gained territory, and new [[nation-states]] were created out of the collapse of Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman and [[Russian Empire]]s.

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-09042, Genf, Völkerbund, Sitzungssaal.jpg|thumb|right|The [[League of Nations]] assembly, held in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]], 1930]]

To prevent a future world war, the [[League of Nations]] was created during the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|1919 Paris Peace Conference]]. The organisation's primary goals were to prevent armed conflict through [[collective security]], military and [[Washington Naval Treaty|naval disarmament]], and settling international disputes through peaceful negotiations and arbitration.

Despite strong [[pacifist]] sentiment [[aftermath of World War I|after World War I]],{{sfn|Ingram|2006|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=bREQibN9i-sC&amp;pg=PA76 76–8]}} its aftermath still caused [[irredentist]] and [[revanchist]] [[nationalism]] in several European states. These sentiments were especially marked in Germany because of the significant territorial, colonial, and financial losses incurred by the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. Under the treaty, Germany lost around 13 percent of its home territory and all of [[German colonial empire|its overseas possessions]], while German annexation of other states was prohibited, [[World War I reparations|reparations]] were imposed, and limits were placed on the size and capability of the country's [[Reichswehr|armed forces]].{{sfn|Kantowicz|1999|p=149}}

[[File:Nürnberg Reichsparteitag Hitler retouched.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Adolf Hitler]] at a German [[National Socialist]] political rally in [[Nuremberg]], August 1933]]

The German Empire was dissolved in the [[German Revolution of 1918–1919]], and a democratic government, later known as the [[Weimar Republic]], was created. The interwar period saw strife between supporters of the new republic and hardline opponents on both the [[right-wing politics|right]] and [[left-wing politics|left]]. Italy, as an Entente ally, had made some post-war territorial gains; however, Italian nationalists were angered that the [[Treaty of London (1915)|promises made]] by the United Kingdom and France to secure Italian entrance into the war were not fulfilled in the peace settlement. From 1922 to 1925, the [[Italian Fascism|Fascist]] movement led by [[Benito Mussolini]] seized power in Italy with a nationalist, [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]], and [[class collaboration]]ist agenda that abolished representative democracy, repressed socialist, left-wing and liberal forces, and pursued an aggressive expansionist foreign policy aimed at making Italy a [[world power]], promising the creation of a "[[New Roman Empire]]".{{sfn|Shaw|2000|p=35}}

[[Adolf Hitler]], after an [[Beer Hall Putsch|unsuccessful attempt to overthrow the German government]] in 1923, eventually [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power|became the Chancellor of Germany]] in 1933. He abolished democracy, espousing a [[New Order (Nazism)|radical, racially motivated revision of the world order]], and soon began a massive [[German re-armament|rearmament campaign]].{{sfn|Brody|1999|p=4}} Meanwhile, France, to secure its alliance, [[Franco-Italian Agreement|allowed Italy a free hand in Ethiopia]], which Italy desired as a colonial possession. The situation was aggravated in early 1935 when the [[Saar (League of Nations)|Territory of the Saar Basin]] was legally reunited with Germany and Hitler repudiated the Treaty of Versailles, accelerated his rearmament programme, and introduced [[conscription]].{{sfn|Zalampas|1989|p=62}}

The United Kingdom, France and Italy formed the [[Stresa Front]] in April 1935 in order to contain Germany, a key step towards [[military globalization]]; however, that June, the United Kingdom made an [[Anglo-German Naval Agreement|independent naval agreement]] with Germany, easing prior restrictions. The Soviet Union, concerned by [[Drang nach Osten|Germany's goals of capturing vast areas of Eastern Europe]], drafted a treaty of mutual assistance with France. Before taking effect though, the [[Franco-Soviet pact]] was required to go through the bureaucracy of the League of Nations, which rendered it essentially toothless.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mandelbaum|1988|p=96}}; {{Harvnb|Record|2005|p=50}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The United States, concerned with events in Europe and Asia, passed the [[Neutrality Acts of 1930s|Neutrality Act]] in August of the same year.{{sfn|Schmitz|2000|p=124}}

Hitler defied the Versailles and [[Locarno treaties]] by [[Remilitarization of the Rhineland|remilitarising the Rhineland]] in March 1936, encountering little opposition due to [[appeasement]].{{sfn|Adamthwaite|1992|p=52}} In October 1936, Germany and Italy formed the [[Rome–Berlin Axis]]. A month later, Germany and Japan signed the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]], which Italy would join in the following year.{{sfn|Shirer|1990|pp=298-299}}

=== Asia ===
The [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) party in China launched a [[Northern Expedition|unification campaign]] against [[Warlord Era|regional warlords]] and nominally unified China in the mid-1920s, but was soon embroiled in a [[Chinese Civil War|civil war]] against its former [[Chinese Communist Party]] allies{{sfn|Preston|1998|p=104}} and [[Central Plains War|new regional warlords]]. In 1931, an [[Statism in Shōwa Japan|increasingly militaristic]] [[Empire of Japan]], which had long sought influence in China{{sfn|Myers|Peattie|1987|p=458}} as the first step of what its government saw as the country's [[Hakko ichiu|right to rule Asia]], used the [[Mukden Incident]] as a pretext to [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria|launch an invasion of Manchuria]] and establish the [[puppet state]] of [[Manchukuo]].{{sfn|Smith|Steadman|2004|p=28}}

Too weak to resist Japan, China appealed to the [[League of Nations]] for help. Japan withdrew from the League of Nations after being [[Lytton Report|condemned]] for its incursion into Manchuria. The two nations then fought several battles, in [[28 January Incident|Shanghai]], [[Battle of Rehe|Rehe]] and [[Defense of the Great Wall|Hebei]], until the [[Tanggu Truce]] was signed in 1933. Thereafter, Chinese volunteer forces continued the resistance to Japanese aggression in [[Pacification of Manchukuo|Manchuria]], and [[Actions in Inner Mongolia (1933–1936)|Chahar and Suiyuan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Coogan|1993}}: "Although some Chinese troops in the Northeast managed to retreat south, others were trapped by the advancing Japanese Army and were faced with the choice of resistance in defiance of orders, or surrender. A few commanders submitted, receiving high office in the puppet government, but others took up arms against the invader. The forces they commanded were the first of the volunteer armies."&lt;/ref&gt; After the 1936 [[Xi'an Incident]], the Kuomintang and communist forces agreed on a ceasefire to present a [[Second United Front|united front]] to oppose Japan.{{sfn|Busky|2002|p=10}}

{{Main|Second Italo-Ethiopian War}}
[[File:Mussolini truppe Etiopia.jpg|thumb|left|[[Benito Mussolini]] inspecting troops during the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War|Italo-Ethiopian War]], 1935]]

The [[Second Italo–Ethiopian War]] was a brief [[colonial war]] that began in October 1935 and ended in May 1936. The war began with the invasion of the [[Ethiopian Empire]] (also known as [[Names of Ethiopia|Abyssinia]]) by the armed forces of the [[Kingdom of Italy]] (''Regno d'Italia''), which was launched from [[Italian Somaliland]] and [[Italian Eritrea|Eritrea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GtCL2OYsH6wC |title=Cultural Sociology of the Middle East, Asia, and Africa: An Encyclopedia |author1=Andrea L.

Seybolt |page=308 |accessdate=6 April 2014|isbn=9781412981767 |date=5 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The war resulted in the [[military occupation]] of Ethiopia and its [[annexation]] into the newly created colony of [[Italian East Africa]] (''Africa Orientale Italiana'', or AOI); in addition it exposed the weakness of the [[League of Nations]] as a force to preserve peace. Both Italy and Ethiopia were member nations, [[Appeasement|but the League did little]] when the former clearly violated Article X of the League's [[Covenant of the League of Nations|Covenant]].{{sfn|Barker|1971|pp=131–2}} The United Kingdom and France supported imposing sanctions on Italy for the invasion, but they were not fully enforced and failed to end the Italian invasion.{{sfn|Shirer|1990|p=289}} Italy subsequently dropped its objections to Germany's goal of absorbing [[Federal State of Austria|Austria]].{{sfn|Kitson|2001|p=231}}

=== Spanish Civil War (1936–1939) ===
{{Main|Spanish Civil War}}

When civil war broke out in Spain, Hitler and Mussolini lent military support to the [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalist rebels]], led by General [[Francisco Franco]]. The Soviet Union supported the existing government, the [[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish Republic]]. Over 30,000 foreign volunteers, known as the [[International Brigades]], also fought against the Nationalists. Both Germany and the Soviet Union used this [[proxy war]] as an opportunity to test in combat their most advanced weapons and tactics. The Nationalists won the civil war in April 1939; Franco, now dictator, remained officially neutral during World War II but generally favoured the Axis.{{sfn|Payne|2008|page=271}} His greatest collaboration with Germany was the sending of [[Blue Division|volunteers]] to fight on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]].{{sfn|Payne|2008|page=146}}

=== Japanese invasion of China (1937) ===
{{Main|Second Sino-Japanese War}}
[[File:Shanghai1937IJA ruins.jpg|thumb|left|[[Japanese Imperial Army]] soldiers during the [[Battle of Shanghai]], 1937]]

In July 1937, Japan captured the former Chinese imperial capital of [[Peking]] after instigating the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]], which culminated in the Japanese campaign to invade all of China.{{sfn|Eastman|1986|pp=547–51}} The Soviets quickly signed a [[Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact|non-aggression pact with China]] to lend [[materiel]] support, effectively ending China's prior [[Sino-German cooperation 1926–1941|co-operation with Germany]]. From September to November, the Japanese attacked [[Battle of Taiyuan|Taiyuan]], engaged the [[National Revolutionary Army|Kuomintang Army]] [[Battle of Xinkou|around Xinkou]],&lt;ref name="Hsu &amp; Chang 1971 221"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hsu|Chang|1971|pp=195–200}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and fought [[Communist Party of China|Communist forces]] [[Battle of Pingxingguan|in Pingxingguan]].&lt;ref name=Tucker2009&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h5_tSnygvbIC&amp;pg=PA1873|title=A Global Chronology of Conflict: From the Ancient World to the Modern Middle East [6 volumes]: From the Ancient World to the Modern Middle East|first=Spencer C.|last=Tucker|date=23 December 2009|publisher=ABC-CLIO|accessdate=27 August 2017|via=Google Books|isbn=9781851096725}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=yang&gt;Yang Kuisong, "On the reconstruction of the facts of the Battle of Pingxingguan"&lt;/ref&gt; [[Generalissimo]] [[Chiang Kai-shek]] deployed his [[German-trained divisions in the National Revolutionary Army|best army]] to [[Battle of Shanghai|defend Shanghai]], but, after three months of fighting, Shanghai fell. The Japanese continued to push the Chinese forces back, [[Battle of Nanking|capturing the capital Nanking]] in December 1937. After the fall of Nanking, tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of Chinese civilians and disarmed combatants were [[Nanking Massacre|murdered by the Japanese]].&lt;ref&gt;Levene, Mark and Roberts, Penny.

In March 1938, Nationalist Chinese forces won their [[Battle of Taierzhuang|first major victory at Taierzhuang]] but then the city of [[Xuzhou]] [[Battle of Xuzhou|was taken by Japanese]] in May.{{sfn|Hsu|Chang|1971|pp=221–230}} In June 1938, Chinese forces stalled the Japanese advance by [[1938 Yellow River flood|flooding the Yellow River]]; this manoeuvre bought time for the Chinese to prepare their defences at [[Wuhan]], but the [[Battle of Wuhan|city was taken]] by October.{{sfn|Eastman|1986|p=566}} Japanese military victories did not bring about the collapse of Chinese resistance that Japan had hoped to achieve; instead the Chinese government relocated inland to [[Chongqing]] and continued the war.{{sfn|Taylor|2009|pp=150–2}}{{sfn|Sella|1983|pp=651–87}}

=== Soviet–Japanese border conflicts ===
{{Main|Soviet–Japanese border conflicts}}
[[File:Battle of Lake Khasan-Red Army gunners in the interval.jpg|thumb|[[Red Army]] artillery unit during the [[Battle of Lake Khasan]], 1938]]

In the mid-to-late 1930s, Japanese forces in [[Manchukuo]] had sporadic border clashes with the Soviet Union and [[Mongolian People's Republic|Mongolia]]. The Japanese doctrine of [[Hokushin-ron]], which emphasised Japan's expansion northward, was favoured by the Imperial Army during this time. With the Japanese defeat at [[Battles of Khalkhin Gol|Khalkin Gol]] in 1939, the ongoing Second Sino-Japanese War{{sfn|Beevor|2012|p=342}} and ally Nazi Germany pursuing neutrality with the Soviets, this policy would prove difficult to maintain. Japan and the Soviet Union eventually signed a [[Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact|Neutrality Pact]] in April 1941, and Japan adopted the doctrine of [[Nanshin-ron]], promoted by the Navy, which took its focus southward, eventually leading to its war with the United States and the Western Allies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Goldman, Stuart D. |date=28 August 2012 |title=The Forgotten Soviet-Japanese War of 1939 |accessdate=26 June 2015 |publisher=The Diplomat |url=http://thediplomat.com/2012/08/the-forgotten-soviet-japanese-war-of-1939/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Timothy Neeno |accessdate=26 June 2015 |title=Nomonhan: The Second Russo-Japanese War |publisher=MilitaryHistoryOnline.com |url=http://www.militaryhistoryonline.com/20thcentury/articles/nomonhan.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, Germany and Italy were becoming more aggressive. In March 1938, Germany [[Anschluss|annexed Austria]], again provoking [[Appeasement of Hitler|little response]] from other European powers.{{sfn|Collier|Pedley|2000|p=144}} Encouraged, Hitler began pressing German claims on the [[Sudetenland]], an area of [[Czechoslovakia]] with a predominantly [[ethnic German]] population. Soon the United Kingdom and France followed the counsel of British Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]] and conceded this territory to Germany in the [[Munich Agreement]], which was made against the wishes of the Czechoslovak government, in exchange for a promise of no further territorial demands.{{sfn|Kershaw|2001|pp=121–2}} Soon afterwards, Germany and Italy forced Czechoslovakia to [[First Vienna Award|cede additional territory]] to [[Hungary]], and Poland annexed Czechoslovakia's [[Zaolzie]] region.{{sfn|Kershaw|2001|p=157}}

Although all of Germany's stated demands had been satisfied by the agreement, privately Hitler was furious that British interference had prevented him from seizing all of Czechoslovakia in one operation. In subsequent speeches Hitler attacked British and Jewish "war-mongers" and in January 1939 [[Plan Z|secretly ordered a major build-up of the German navy]] to challenge British naval supremacy.

With the situation in Europe and Asia relatively stable, Germany, Japan, and the Soviet Union made preparations. With the Soviets wary of mounting tensions with Germany and the Japanese planning to take advantage of the European War by seizing resource-rich European possessions in [[Southeast Asia]], the two powers signed the [[Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact]] in April 1941.{{sfn|Garver|1988|p=114}} By contrast, the Germans were steadily making preparations for an attack on the Soviet Union, massing forces on the Soviet border.{{sfn|Weinberg|2005|p=195}}

Hitler believed that the United Kingdom's refusal to end the war was based on the hope that the United States and the Soviet Union would enter the war against Germany sooner or later.{{sfn|Murray|1983|p=[http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/AAF/AAF-Luftwaffe/AAF-Luftwaffe-3.html 69]}} He therefore decided to try to strengthen Germany's relations with the Soviets, or failing that to attack and eliminate them as a factor. In November 1940, [[German–Soviet Axis talks|negotiations took place]] to determine if the Soviet Union would join the Tripartite Pact. The Soviets showed some interest, but asked for concessions from Finland, Bulgaria, Turkey, and Japan that Germany considered unacceptable.

=== War breaks out in the Pacific (1941) ===
{{Main|Pacific War}}

In 1939, the United States had renounced its trade treaty with Japan, and beginning with an [[aviation gasoline]] ban in July 1940, Japan became subject to increasing economic pressure.{{r|ibiblio_1940}} During this time, Japan launched its [[Battle of Changsha (1939)|first attack against Changsha]], a strategically important Chinese city, but was repulsed by late September.{{sfn|Jowett|Andrew|2002|p=14}} Despite [[1939–40 Winter Offensive|several offensives]] by both sides, the war between China and Japan was stalemated by 1940.

Chinese nationalist forces launched a large-scale [[1939–40 Winter Offensive|counter-offensive]] in early 1940. In August, [[Communist Party of China|Chinese communists]] launched an [[Hundred Regiments Offensive|offensive in Central China]]; in retaliation, Japan instituted [[Three Alls Policy|harsh measures]] in occupied areas to reduce human and material resources for the communists.{{sfn|Joes|2004|p=224}} Continued antipathy between Chinese communist and nationalist forces [[New Fourth Army incident|culminated in armed clashes in January 1941]], effectively ending their co-operation.{{sfn|Fairbank|Goldman|2006|p=320}} In March, the Japanese 11th army attacked the headquarters of the Chinese 19th army but was repulsed during [[Battle of Shanggao]].{{sfn|Hsu|Chang|1971|p=30}} In September, Japan attempted to [[Battle of Changsha (1941)|take the city of Changsha]] again and clashed with Chinese nationalist forces.{{sfn|Hsu|Chang|1971|p=33}}

German successes in Europe encouraged Japan to increase pressure on European governments in [[Southeast Asia]]. The Dutch government agreed to provide Japan some oil supplies from the [[Dutch East Indies]], but negotiations for additional access to their resources ended in failure in June 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Japanese Policy and Strategy 1931 – July 1941 |website=US Army in WWII – Strategy and Command: The First Two Years |pp=45–66 |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-P-Strategy/Strategy-2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1941 Japan sent troops to southern Indochina, thus threatening British and Dutch possessions in the Far East. The United States, United Kingdom and other Western governments reacted to this move with a freeze on Japanese assets and a total oil embargo.{{sfn|Anderson|1975|p=201}}{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|2012|p=456}} At the same time, Japan was [[Kantokuen|planning an invasion of the Soviet Far East]], intending to capitalise off the German invasion in the west, but abandoned the operation after the sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coox|first1=Alvin|title=Nomonhan: Japan against Russia, 1939|date=1985|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford, California|pages=1046–1049|isbn=978-0-8047-1835-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since early 1941 the United States and Japan had been engaged in negotiations in an attempt to improve their strained relations and end the war in China. During these negotiations Japan advanced a number of proposals which were dismissed by the Americans as inadequate.&lt;ref name=USAWWIIcp5&gt;{{cite web |title=The decision for War |website=US Army in WWII – Strategy and Command: The First Two Years |pp=113–27 |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-P-Strategy/Strategy-5.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands engaged in secret discussions for the joint defence of their territories, in the event of a Japanese attack against any of them.&lt;ref name=USAWWIIcp4&gt;{{cite web |title=The Showdown With Japan Aug–Dec 1941 |website=US Army in WWII – Strategic Planning for Coalition Warfare |pp=63–96 |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-WD-Strategic1/USA-WD-Strategic1-4.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roosevelt reinforced [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|the Philippines (an American protectorate scheduled for independence in 1946)]] and warned Japan that the United States would react to Japanese attacks against any "neighboring countries".{{r|USAWWIIcp4}}

Frustrated at the lack of progress and feeling the pinch of the American-British-Dutch sanctions, Japan prepared for war. On 20 November a new government under [[Hideki Tojo]] presented an interim proposal as its final offer. It called for the end of American aid to China and for lifting the embargo on the supply of oil and other resources to Japan. In exchange Japan promised not to launch any attacks in Southeast Asia and to withdraw its forces from southern Indochina.{{r|USAWWIIcp5}} The American counter-proposal of 26 November required that Japan evacuate all of China without conditions and conclude non-aggression pacts with all Pacific powers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibiblio.org/pha/pha/congress/app-d.html#363 The United States Replies]. Investigation of the Pearl Harbor attack.&lt;/ref&gt; That meant Japan was essentially forced to choose between abandoning its ambitions in China, or seizing the natural resources it needed in the Dutch East Indies by force;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Painter|2012|p=26}}: "The United States cut off oil exports to Japan in the summer of 1941, forcing Japanese leaders to choose between going to war to seize the oil fields of the Netherlands East Indies or giving in to U.S. pressure."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wood|2007|p=9}}, listing various military and diplomatic developments, observes that "the threat to Japan was not purely economic."&lt;/ref&gt; the Japanese military did not consider the former an option, and many officers considered the oil embargo an unspoken declaration of war.{{sfn|Lightbody|2004|p=125}}

Japan planned to rapidly seize European colonies in Asia to create a large defensive perimeter stretching into the Central Pacific. The Japanese would then be free to exploit the resources of Southeast Asia while exhausting the over-stretched Allies by fighting a defensive war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Weinberg|2005|p=310}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dower|1986|p=5}}, calls attention to the fact that "the Allied struggle against Japan exposed the racist underpinnings of the European and American colonial structure. Japan did not invade independent countries in southern Asia. It invaded colonial outposts which the Westerners had dominated for generations, taking absolutely for granted their racial and cultural superiority over their Asian subjects." Dower goes on to note that, before the horrors of Japanese occupation made themselves felt, many Asians responded favourably to the victories of the Imperial Japanese forces.&lt;/ref&gt; To prevent American intervention while securing the perimeter, it was further planned to neutralise the [[United States Pacific Fleet]] and the American military presence in the Philippines from the outset.{{sfn|Wood|2007|pp=11–2}} On 7 December 1941 (8 December in Asian time zones), Japan attacked British and American holdings with near-simultaneous [[Japanese expansion (1941–1942)|offensives against Southeast Asia and the Central Pacific]].{{sfn|Wohlstetter|1962|pp=341–3}} These included an [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|attack on the American fleets at Pearl Harbor]] and [[Philippines Campaign (1941–42)|the Philippines]], [[Malayan Campaign|landings in Thailand and Malaya]],{{sfn|Wohlstetter|1962|pp=341–3}} and the [[Battle of Hong Kong]].{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

These attacks led the [[United States declaration of war on Japan|United States]], [[United Kingdom declaration of war on Japan|United Kingdom]], China, Australia and several other states to formally declare war on Japan, whereas the Soviet Union, being heavily involved in large-scale hostilities with European Axis countries, maintained its neutrality agreement with Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dunn|1998|p=157}}. According to {{Harvnb|May|1955|p=155}}, Churchill stated: "Russian declaration of war on Japan would be greatly to our advantage, provided, but only provided, that Russians are confident that will not impair their Western Front."&lt;/ref&gt; Germany, followed by the other Axis states, declared war on the United States&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Adolf Hitler's Declaration of War against the United States|Adolf Hitler's Declaration of War against the United States]] in Wikisource.&lt;/ref&gt; in solidarity with Japan, citing as justification the American attacks on German war vessels that had been ordered by Roosevelt.{{r|Events1941}}&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Klooz |first1=Marle |last2=Wiley |first2=Evelyn |others=Director: Humphrey, Richard A. |year=1944 |title=Events leading up to World War II – Chronological History |series=78th Congress, 2d Session – House Document N. 541 |location=Washington |publisher=US Government Printing Office |at=p. 310 ([http://www.ibiblio.org/pha/events/1941.html 1941]) |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/pha/events/}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Casablanca-Conference.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|US President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and British PM [[Winston Churchill]] seated at the [[Casablanca Conference]], January 1943]]

On 1 January 1942, the [[Four Policemen|Allied Big Four]]{{sfn|Bosworth|Maiolo|2015|pp=313–314}}—the Soviet Union, China, the United Kingdom and the United States—and 22 smaller or exiled governments issued the [[Declaration by United Nations]], thereby affirming the [[Atlantic Charter]],{{sfn|Mingst|Karns|2007|p=22}} and agreeing to not to sign a [[separate peace]] with the Axis powers.{{sfn|Shirer|1990|p=904}}

During 1942, Allied officials debated on the appropriate [[grand strategy]] to pursue. All agreed that [[Europe first|defeating Germany]] was the primary objective. The Americans favoured a straightforward, [[Operation Sledgehammer|large-scale attack]] on Germany through France. The Soviets were also demanding a second front. The British, on the other hand, argued that military operations should target peripheral areas to wear out German strength, leading to increasing demoralisation, and bolster resistance forces. Germany itself would be subject to a heavy bombing campaign. An offensive against Germany would then be launched primarily by Allied armour without using large-scale armies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The First Full Dress Debate over Strategic Deployment.

At the [[Casablanca Conference]] in early 1943, the Allies reiterated the statements issued in the 1942 Declaration by the United Nations, and demanded the [[unconditional surrender]] of their enemies. The British and Americans agreed to continue to press the initiative in the Mediterranean by invading Sicily to fully secure the Mediterranean supply routes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Casablanca – Beginning of an Era: January 1943 |website=US Army in WWII – Strategic Planning for Coalition Warfare |pp=18–42 |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-WD-Strategic2/USA-WD-Strategic2-1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the British argued for further operations in the Balkans to bring Turkey into the war, in May 1943, the Americans extracted a British commitment to limit Allied operations in the Mediterranean to an invasion of the Italian mainland and to invade France in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Trident Conference – New Patterns: May 1943 |website=US Army in WWII – Strategic Planning for Coalition Warfare |pp=126–45 |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-WD-Strategic2/USA-WD-Strategic2-6.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of April 1942, Japan and its ally Thailand had almost fully conquered [[Japanese conquest of Burma|Burma]], [[Battle of Malaya|Malaya]], [[Dutch East Indies campaign|the Dutch East Indies]], [[Battle of Singapore|Singapore]], and [[Rabaul]], inflicting severe losses on Allied troops and taking a large number of prisoners.{{sfn|Beevor|2012|pp=247–267, 345}} Despite stubborn [[Philippines Campaign (1941–42)|resistance]] by Filipino and US forces, the [[Philippine Commonwealth]] was eventually captured in May 1942, forcing its government into exile.{{sfn|Lewis|1953|loc=p. 529 (Table 11)}} On 16 April, in Burma, 7,000 British soldiers were encircled by the Japanese 33rd Division during the [[Battle of Yenangyaung]] and rescued by the Chinese 38th Division.{{sfn|Slim|1956|pp=71–4}} Japanese forces also achieved naval victories in the [[Sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse|South China Sea]], [[Battle of the Java Sea|Java Sea]] and [[Indian Ocean raid (1942)|Indian Ocean]],{{sfn|Grove|1995|p=362}} and [[Bombing of Darwin|bombed the Allied naval base]] at [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], Australia. In January 1942, the only Allied success against Japan was a Chinese [[Battle of Changsha (1942)|victory at Changsha]].{{sfn|Ch'i|1992|p=158}} These easy victories over unprepared US and European opponents left Japan overconfident, as well as overextended.{{sfn|Perez|1998|p=145}}

In early May 1942, Japan initiated operations to [[Operation Mo|capture Port Moresby]] by [[amphibious assault]] and thus sever communications and supply lines between the United States and Australia. The planned invasion was thwarted when an Allied task force, centred on two American fleet carriers, fought Japanese naval forces to a draw in the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]].{{sfn|Maddox|1992|pp=111–2}} Japan's next plan, motivated by the earlier [[Doolittle Raid]], was to seize [[Midway Atoll]] and lure American carriers into battle to be eliminated; as a diversion, Japan would also send forces to [[Aleutian Islands Campaign|occupy the Aleutian Islands]] in Alaska.{{sfn|Salecker|2001|p=186}} In mid-May, Japan started the [[Zhejiang-Jiangxi Campaign]] in China, with the goal of inflicting retribution on the Chinese who aided the surviving American airmen in the Doolittle Raid by destroying air bases and fighting against the Chinese 23rd and 32nd Army Groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schoppa|2011|p=28}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=lILltXBTo8oC&amp;pg=PA19 Chevrier &amp; Chomiczewski &amp; Garrigue 2004], p.19.&lt;/ref&gt; In early June, Japan put its operations into action, but the Americans, having broken [[Japanese naval codes]] in late May, were fully aware of the plans and order of battle, and used this knowledge to achieve a decisive [[Battle of Midway|victory at Midway]] over the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ropp|2000|p=368}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Marines rest in the field on Guadalcanal.jpg|left|thumb|[[United States Marine Corps|US Marines]] during the [[Guadalcanal Campaign]], in the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|Pacific theatre]], 1942]]

With its capacity for aggressive action greatly diminished as a result of the Midway battle, Japan chose to focus on a belated attempt to capture [[Port Moresby]] by an [[Kokoda Track campaign|overland campaign]] in the [[Territory of Papua]].{{sfn|Weinberg|2005|p=339}} The Americans planned a counter-attack against Japanese positions in the southern [[Solomon Islands]], primarily [[Guadalcanal]], as a first step towards capturing [[Rabaul]], the main Japanese base in Southeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Gilbert |first=Adrian |year=2003 |title=The Encyclopedia of Warfare: From Earliest Times to the Present Day |publisher=Globe Pequot |isbn=978-1-59228-027-8 |p=259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both plans started in July, but by mid-September, [[Guadalcanal Campaign|the Battle for Guadalcanal]] took priority for the Japanese, and troops in New Guinea were ordered to withdraw from the Port Moresby area to the [[Oro Province|northern part of the island]], where they faced Australian and United States troops in the [[Battle of Buna-Gona]].{{sfn|Swain|2001|p=197}} Guadalcanal soon became a focal point for both sides with heavy commitments of troops and ships in the battle for Guadalcanal.

Despite considerable losses, in early 1942 Germany and its allies stopped a major Soviet offensive in central and southern Russia, keeping most territorial gains they had achieved during the previous year.{{sfn|Glantz|2001|p=31}} In May the Germans defeated Soviet offensives in the [[Battle of the Kerch Peninsula|Kerch Peninsula]] and at [[Second Battle of Kharkov|Kharkov]],{{sfn|Read|2004|p=764}} and then launched their main [[Case Blue|summer offensive]] against southern Russia in June 1942, to seize the [[Baku Oil Fields|oil fields of the Caucasus]] and occupy [[Kuban]] [[steppe]], while maintaining positions on the northern and central areas of the front. The Germans split [[Army Group South]] into two groups: [[Army Group A]] advanced to the lower [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]] and struck south-east to the Caucasus, while [[Army Group B]] headed towards the [[Volga River]].

Within a week, German forces had exhausted themselves against the Soviets' deeply echeloned and well-constructed defences,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Glantz|1986}}; {{Harvnb|Glantz|1989|pp=149–59}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and for the first time in the war Hitler cancelled the operation before it had achieved tactical or operational success.{{sfn|Kershaw|2001|p=592}} This decision was partially affected by the Western Allies' [[Allied invasion of Sicily|invasion of Sicily]] launched on 9 July, which, combined with previous Italian failures, resulted in the ousting and arrest of Mussolini later that month.{{sfn|O'Reilly|2001|p=32}}

On 12 July 1943, the Soviets launched their own [[Operation Kutuzov|counter-offensives]], thereby dispelling any chance of German victory or even stalemate in the east. The Soviet victory at Kursk marked the end of German superiority,{{sfn|Bellamy|2007|p=595}} giving the Soviet Union the initiative on the Eastern Front.{{sfn|O'Reilly|2001|p=35}}{{sfn|Healy|1992|p=90}} The Germans tried to stabilise their eastern front along the hastily fortified [[Panther–Wotan line]], but the Soviets broke through it at [[Battle of Smolensk (1943)|Smolensk]] and by the [[Lower Dnieper Offensive]]s.{{sfn|Glantz|2001|pp=50–5}}

On 3 September 1943, the Western Allies [[Allied invasion of Italy|invaded the Italian mainland]], following [[Armistice of Cassibile|Italy's armistice with the Allies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kolko|1990|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Germany with the help of fascists responded by disarming Italian forces that were in many places without superior orders, seizing military control of Italian areas,{{sfn|Mazower|2008|p=362}} and creating a series of defensive lines.{{sfn|Hart|Hart|Hughes|2000|p=151}} German special forces then [[Gran Sasso raid|rescued Mussolini]], who then soon established a new client state in German-occupied Italy named the [[Italian Social Republic]],{{sfn|Blinkhorn|2006|p=52}} causing an [[Italian Civil War|Italian civil war]]. The Western Allies fought through several lines until reaching the [[Winter Line|main German defensive line]] in mid-November.{{sfn|Read|Fisher|2002|p=129}}

German operations in the Atlantic also suffered. By [[Black May (1943)|May 1943, as Allied counter-measures became increasingly effective]], the resulting sizeable German submarine losses forced a temporary halt of the German Atlantic naval campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Padfield|1998|pp=335–6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1943, [[Franklin D.

From November 1943, during the seven-week [[Battle of Changde]], the Chinese forced Japan to fight a costly war of attrition, while awaiting Allied relief.&lt;ref name="Beevor 2012 268_274"&gt;{{Harvnb|Beevor|2012|pp=268–74}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=H161&gt;{{Harvnb|Ch'i|1992|p=161}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hsu Chang 412-416"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hsu|Chang|1971|pp=412–416, Map 38}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1944, the Allies launched a [[Battle of Monte Cassino|series of attacks in Italy against the line at Monte Cassino]] and tried to outflank it with [[Operation Shingle|landings at Anzio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Weinberg|2005|pp=660–1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 January 1944, [[Leningrad Front|Soviet]] troops launched [[Siege of Leningrad#Soviet relief of the siege|a major offensive]] that expelled German forces from the [[Leningrad Oblast|Leningrad region]], thereby ending the longest and [[List of battles by casualties#Sieges and urban combat|most lethal siege in history]].&lt;ref name="Glantz 2002 327_366"&gt;{{Harvnb|Glantz|2002|pp=327–66}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Leningrad–Novgorod Offensive|following Soviet offensive]] was [[Battle of Narva (1944)|halted on the pre-war Estonian border]] by the German [[Army Group North]] aided by [[Occupation of Estonia by Nazi Germany#Estonians in German Military Units in 1941–1944|Estonians]] hoping to [[Estonian government-in-exile#Failure to reestablish independence|re-establish national independence]].

The period featured massacres with victims in the hundreds at [[Civitella in Val di Chiana|Civitella]] ({{Harvnb|de Grazia|Paggi|1991}}; {{Harvnb|Belco|2010}}), [[Ardeatine massacre|Fosse Ardeatine]] ({{Harvnb|Portelli|2003}}), and [[Sant'Anna di Stazzema massacre|Sant'Anna di Stazzema]] ({{Harvnb|Gordon|2012|pp=10–1}}), and is capped with the [[Marzabotto massacre]].&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The Allies had mixed success in mainland Asia. In March 1944, the Japanese launched the first of two invasions, [[Operation U-Go|an operation against British positions in Assam, India]],&lt;ref name="Lightbody 2004 224"&gt;{{Harvnb|Lightbody|2004|p=224}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and soon besieged Commonwealth positions at [[Battle of Imphal|Imphal]] and [[Battle of Kohima|Kohima]].&lt;ref name="Zeiler"&gt;{{Harvnb|Zeiler|2004|p=60}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1944, British forces mounted a counter-offensive that drove Japanese troops back to Burma,&lt;ref name="Zeiler"/&gt; and Chinese forces that had [[Battle of Northern Burma and Western Yunnan|invaded northern Burma]] in late 1943 [[Siege of Myitkyina|besieged Japanese troops]] in [[Myitkyina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Beevor|2012|pp=555–60}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Operation Ichi-Go|second Japanese invasion]] of China aimed to destroy China's main fighting forces, secure railways between Japanese-held territory and capture Allied airfields.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ch'i|1992|p=163}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By June, the Japanese had conquered the province of [[Henan]] and begun a [[Battle of Changsha (1944)|new attack on Changsha]] in the [[Hunan]] province.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Coble|2003|p=85}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

An attempt to advance into northern Germany spearheaded by [[Operation Market Garden|a major airborne operation]] in the Netherlands failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dear|Foot|2001|p=562}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After that, the Western Allies slowly pushed into Germany, but [[Operation Queen|failed to cross the Ruhr river]] in a large offensive.

On 22 June, the Soviets launched a strategic offensive in Belarus ("[[Operation Bagration]]") that destroyed the German [[Army Group Centre]] almost completely.&lt;ref name="Zaloga 1996 7"&gt;{{Harvnb|Zaloga|1996|p=7}}: "It was the most calamitous defeat of all the German armed forces in World War II."&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after that, [[Lvov–Sandomierz Offensive|another Soviet strategic offensive]] forced German troops from Western Ukraine and Eastern Poland. The Soviet advance prompted [[Armia Krajowa|resistance forces in Poland]] to [[Operation Tempest|initiate several uprisings]] against the German occupation. However, the largest of these, [[Warsaw Uprising|in Warsaw]] and a [[Slovak National Uprising|national uprising]] in [[Slovak Republic (1939–1945)|Slovakia]], did not receive Soviet support and were subsequently suppressed by the Germans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Berend|1996|p=8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Red Army's [[Jassy–Kishinev Offensive|strategic offensive in eastern Romania]] cut off and destroyed the [[Army Group South Ukraine|considerable German troops there]] and triggered [[King Michael's Coup|a successful coup d'état in Romania]] and [[Bulgarian coup d'état of 1944|in Bulgaria]], followed by those countries' shift to the Allied side.&lt;ref name="countrystudies.us"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/romania/23.htm|title=Armistice Negotiations and Soviet Occupation|publisher=US Library of Congress|accessdate=14 November 2009|quote=The coup speeded the Red Army's advance, and the Soviet Union later awarded Michael the Order of Victory for his personal courage in overthrowing Antonescu and putting an end to Romania's war against the Allies.

In September 1944, Soviet troops advanced into [[Democratic Federal Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] and forced the rapid withdrawal of German Army Groups [[Army Group E|E]] and [[Army Group F|F]] in [[Axis occupation of Greece|Greece]], [[Albanian Kingdom (1943–44)|Albania]] and Yugoslavia to rescue them from being cut off.&lt;ref name="Evans 2008 653"&gt;{{Harvnb|Evans|2008|p=653}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By this point, the Communist-led [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisans]] under Marshal [[Josip Broz Tito]], who had led an [[World War II in Yugoslavia|increasingly successful guerrilla campaign]] against the occupation since 1941, controlled much of the territory of Yugoslavia and engaged in delaying efforts against German forces further south. In northern [[Serbia (1941–1944)|Serbia]], the [[Red Army]], with limited support from Bulgarian forces, assisted the Partisans in a joint [[Belgrade Offensive|liberation of the capital city of Belgrade]] on 20 October. A few days later, the Soviets launched a [[Budapest Offensive|massive assault]] against [[Operation Panzerfaust|German-occupied]] Hungary that lasted until [[Battle of Budapest|the fall of Budapest]] in February 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wiest|Barbier|2002|pp=65–6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike impressive Soviet victories in the Balkans, [[Continuation War|bitter Finnish resistance]] to the [[Vyborg–Petrozavodsk Offensive|Soviet offensive]] in the [[Karelian Isthmus]] denied the Soviets occupation of Finland and led to a [[Moscow Armistice|Soviet-Finnish armistice]] on relatively mild conditions,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Wiktor|first=Christian L|title=Multilateral Treaty Calendar – 1648–1995|publisher=Kluwer Law International|year=1998|isbn=978-90-411-0584-4|page=426}}&lt;/ref&gt; although Finland was forced to [[Lapland War|fight their former allies]].{{sfn|Schire|1990|p=1085}}

In the Pacific, US forces continued to press back the Japanese perimeter. In mid-June 1944, they began their [[Mariana and Palau Islands campaign|offensive against the Mariana and Palau islands]], and decisively defeated Japanese forces in the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]]. These defeats led to the resignation of the Japanese Prime Minister, [[Hideki Tojo]], and provided the United States with air bases to launch intensive heavy bomber attacks on the Japanese home islands. In late October, American forces [[Battle of Leyte|invaded the Filipino island of Leyte]]; soon after, Allied naval forces scored another large victory in the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]], one of the largest naval battles in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cook|Bewes|1997|p=305}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Axis collapse, Allied victory (1944–45) ===
On 16 December 1944, Germany made a last attempt on the Western Front by using most of its remaining reserves to launch [[Battle of the Bulge|a massive counter-offensive in the Ardennes]] and [[Operation Nordwind|along the French–German border]] to split the Western Allies, encircle large portions of Western Allied troops and capture their primary supply port at [[Antwerp]] to prompt a political settlement.&lt;ref name="parkerxiii"&gt;{{Harvnb|Parker|2004|pp=xiii–xiv, 6–8, 68–70, 329–330}}&lt;/ref&gt; By January, the offensive had been repulsed with no strategic objectives fulfilled.&lt;ref name="parkerxiii"/&gt; In Italy, the Western Allies remained stalemated at the German defensive line.

The key military factor causing this effect was the sea blockade, which crippled Japan's ability to produce and equip the forces necessary to execute its strategy. The most important factor accounting for the timing of surrender  was the Soviet attack against Manchuria, largely because it persuaded previously adamant Army leaders that the homeland could not be defended.".&lt;/ref&gt; The Red Army also captured the southern part of [[Sakhalin]] Island and the [[Kuril Islands]]. On 15 August 1945, [[Surrender of Japan|Japan surrendered]], with the [[Japanese Instrument of Surrender|surrender documents]] finally signed at [[Tokyo Bay]] on the deck of the American battleship [[USS Missouri (BB-63)|USS ''Missouri'']] on 2 September 1945, ending the war.&lt;ref name="Beevor 2012 776"&gt;{{Harvnb|Beevor|2012|p=776}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Allies established occupation administrations in [[Allied-occupied Austria|Austria]] and [[Allied-occupied Germany|Germany]]. The former became a neutral state, non-aligned with any political bloc. The latter was divided into western and eastern occupation zones controlled by the Western Allies and the Soviet Union. A [[denazification]] programme in Germany led to the prosecution of Nazi war criminals in the [[Nuremberg trials]] and the removal of ex-Nazis from power, although this policy moved towards amnesty and re-integration of ex-Nazis into West German society.&lt;ref name="Frei 2002 41_66"&gt;{{Harvnb|Frei|2002|pp=41–66}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an effort to maintain [[world peace]],&lt;ref name="Yoder 1997 39"&gt;{{Harvnb|Yoder|1997|p=39}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the Allies formed the [[United Nations]], which officially came into existence on 24 October 1945,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/aboutun/history.htm |title=History of the UN |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=25 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218221016/http://www.un.org/aboutun/history.htm |archivedate=18 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and adopted the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] in 1948 as a common standard for all [[Member states of the United Nations|member nations]].&lt;ref name="Waltz 2002"&gt;{{Harvnb|Waltz|2002}}.&lt;br&gt;
The UDHR is viewable here [https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/].&lt;/ref&gt; The great powers that were the victors of the war—France, China, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union and the United States—became the [[Permanent members of the United Nations Security Council|permanent members]] of the UN's [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]].&lt;ref name="The UN Security Council"/&gt; The five permanent members remain so to the present, although there have been two seat changes, [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758|between]] the [[Taiwan|Republic of China]] and the [[China|People's Republic of China]] in 1971, and between the Soviet Union and its [[successor state]], the [[Russia|Russian Federation]], following the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991.

[[File:EasternBloc BorderChange38-48.svg|thumb|upright=0.8|Post-war border changes in [[Central Europe]] and creation of the [[Eastern Bloc]]]]

Germany had been ''de facto'' divided, and two independent states, the [[West Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]] and the [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]],&lt;ref name="Wettig 2008 96_100"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|pp=96–100}}.&lt;/ref&gt; were created within the borders of [[Bizone|Allied]] and [[Soviet occupation zone]]s.

As a result, [[East Germany]],&lt;ref name="Applebaum 2012"&gt;{{Harvnb|Applebaum|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]], [[Hungarian People's Republic|Hungary]], [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]], [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]], and [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|Albania]]&lt;ref name="Naimark 2010"&gt;{{Harvnb|Naimark|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt; became Soviet [[satellite state]]s.

Post-war division of the world was formalised by two international military alliances, the United States-led [[NATO]] and the Soviet-led [[Warsaw Pact]].&lt;ref name="Borstelmann 2005 318"&gt;{{Harvnb|Borstelmann|2005|p=318}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The long period of political tensions and military competition between them, the [[Cold War]], would be accompanied by an unprecedented [[arms race]] and [[proxy war]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Leffler|Westad|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Asia, the United States led the [[occupation of Japan]] and [[Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands|administrated Japan's former islands]] in the Western Pacific, while the Soviets annexed [[Sakhalin]] and the [[Kuril Islands]].&lt;ref name="Weinberg 2005 911"&gt;{{Harvnb|Weinberg|2005|p=911}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Korea]], formerly [[Korea under Japanese rule|under Japanese rule]], was [[Division of Korea|divided and occupied]] by the Soviet Union in the [[North Korea|North]] and the United States in the [[South Korea|South]] between 1945 and 1948.

In China, nationalist and communist forces resumed [[Chinese Civil War|the civil war]] in June 1946. Communist forces were victorious and established the People's Republic of China on the mainland, while nationalist forces retreated to [[Taiwan]] in 1949.&lt;ref name="Lynch 2010 12_13"&gt;{{Harvnb|Lynch|2010|pp=12–3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Middle East, the Arab rejection of the [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine]] and the [[creation of Israel]] marked the escalation of the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]]. While European powers attempted to retain some or all of their [[colonial empire]]s, their losses of prestige and resources during the war rendered this unsuccessful, leading to [[Decolonization|decolonisation]].&lt;ref name="JMRoberts 1996 589"&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|1997|p=589}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|2007|pp=441–3, 464–8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The global economy suffered heavily from the war, although participating nations were affected differently. The United States emerged much richer than any other nation, leading to a [[Post–World War II baby boom|baby boom]], and by 1950 its gross domestic product per person was much higher than that of any of the other powers, and it dominated the world economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dear|Foot|2001|p=1006}}; {{Harvnb|Harrison|1998|pp=34–5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The UK and US pursued a policy of [[Allied plans for German industry after World War II|industrial disarmament in Western Germany]] in the years 1945–1948.&lt;ref name = "Balabkins 1964 207"&gt;{{Harvnb|Balabkins|1964|p=207}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of international trade interdependencies this led to European economic stagnation and delayed European recovery for several years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Petrov|1967|p=263}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Balabkins 1964 208,209"&gt;{{Harvnb|Balabkins|1964|pp=208, 209}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese [[prisoner-of-war camp]]s, many of which were used as labour camps, also had high death rates.

At least five million Chinese civilians from northern China and Manchukuo were enslaved between 1935 and 1941 by the [[East Asia Development Board]], or ''Kōain'', for work in mines and war industries. After 1942, the number reached 10 million.&lt;ref name="zhifen2002"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ju|url=http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~asiactr/sino-japanese/session6.htm|first=Zhifen|title=Japan's atrocities of conscripting and abusing north China draughtees after the outbreak of the Pacific war|work=Joint Study of the Sino-Japanese War:Minutes of the June 2002 Conference|publisher=Harvard University Faculty of Arts and Sciences|date=June 2002|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120521093637/http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~asiactr/sino-japanese/session6.htm|archivedate=21 May 2012|accessdate=28 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Java]], between 4 and 10 million ''[[rōmusha]]'' (Japanese: "manual labourers"), were forced to work by the Japanese military.

[[File:Palmiry before execution.jpg|thumb|right|Polish civilians wearing blindfolds photographed just before [[Palmiry massacre|their execution by German soldiers in Palmiry forest]], 1940]]

In Europe, occupation came under two forms. In Western, Northern, and Central Europe (France, Norway, Denmark, the Low Countries, and the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia|annexed portions of Czechoslovakia]]) Germany established economic policies through which it collected roughly 69.5 billion reichmarks (27.8 billion US dollars) by the end of the war; this figure does not include the [[Nazi plunder|sizeable plunder]] of industrial products, military equipment, raw materials and other goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Liberman|1996|p=42}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the income from occupied nations was over 40 per cent of the income Germany collected from taxation, a figure which increased to nearly 40 per cent of total German income as the war went on.&lt;ref name="Milward 1979 138"&gt;{{Harvnb|Milward|1992|p=138}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-031-2436-03A, Russland, Hinrichtung von Partisanen retouched.jpg|thumb|left|[[Soviet partisans]] hung executed by the German army. The [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] reported in 1995 [[World War II casualties of the Soviet Union|civilian victims in the Soviet Union]] at German hands totalled 13.7 million dead, twenty percent of the 68 million persons in the occupied Soviet Union.]]

In the East, the intended gains of ''[[Lebensraum]]'' were never attained as fluctuating front-lines and Soviet [[scorched earth]] policies denied resources to the German invaders.&lt;ref name="Milward 1992 148"&gt;{{Harvnb|Milward|1992|p=148}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike in the West, the [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|Nazi racial policy]] encouraged extreme brutality against what it considered to be the "[[Untermensch|inferior people]]" of Slavic descent; most German advances were thus followed by [[Generalplan Ost|mass executions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barber|Harrison|2006|p=232}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[Resistance during World War II|resistance groups]] formed in most occupied territories, they did not significantly hamper German operations in either the East&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hill|2005|p=5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or the West&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Christofferson|Christofferson|2006|p=156}}&lt;/ref&gt; until late 1943.

In Asia, Japan termed nations under its occupation as being part of the [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]], essentially a Japanese [[hegemony]] which it claimed was for purposes of liberating colonised peoples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Radtke|1997|p=107}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Japanese forces were originally welcomed as liberators from European domination in some territories, their excessive brutality turned local public opinion against them within weeks.&lt;ref name="GSWW6_266" /&gt; During Japan's initial conquest it captured {{convert|4000000|oilbbl}} of oil (~5.5×10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; tonnes) left behind by retreating Allied forces, and by 1943 was able to get production in the Dutch East Indies up to {{bbl to t|50|mlt=M}}, 76 per cent of its 1940 output rate.&lt;ref name="GSWW6_266"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rahn|2001|p=266}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Home fronts and production ===
{{Main|Military production during World War II|Home front during World War II}}
[[File:WorldWarII-GDP-Relations-Allies-Axis-simple.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Allied to Axis GDP ratio]]

In Europe, before the outbreak of the war, the Allies had significant advantages in both population and economics. In 1938, the Western Allies (United Kingdom, France, Poland and British Dominions) had a 30 per cent larger population and a 30 per cent higher gross domestic product than the European Axis powers (Germany and Italy); if colonies are included, it then gives the Allies more than a 5:1 advantage in population and nearly 2:1 advantage in GDP.&lt;ref name="6Econ3"&gt;{{Harvnb|Harrison|1998|p=3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In Asia at the same time, China had roughly six times the population of Japan, but only an 89 per cent higher GDP; this is reduced to three times the population and only a 38 per cent higher GDP if Japanese colonies are included.&lt;ref name="6Econ3"/&gt;

The United States provided about two-thirds of all the ordnance used by the Allies in terms of warships, transports, warplanes, artillery, tanks, trucks, and ammunition.&lt;ref&gt;Mark R. Wilson, ''Destructive Creation: American Business and the Winning of World War II'' (2016) p.2.&lt;/ref&gt; Though the Allies' economic and population advantages were largely mitigated during the initial rapid blitzkrieg attacks of Germany and Japan, they became the decisive factor by 1942, after the United States and Soviet Union joined the Allies, as the war largely settled into one of [[Attrition warfare|attrition]].&lt;ref name="6Econ2"&gt;{{Harvnb|Harrison|1998|p=2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; While the Allies' ability to out-produce the Axis is often attributed to the Allies having more access to natural resources, other factors, such as Germany and Japan's reluctance to employ women in the [[labour force]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|1991|p=267}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Allied [[Strategic bombing during World War II|strategic bombing]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Griffith|first=Charles|title=The Quest: Haywood Hansell and American Strategic Bombing in World War II|isbn=978-1-58566-069-8|publisher=DIANE Publishing|year=1999|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Germany's late shift to a [[war economy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Overy|1994|p=26}}.&lt;/ref&gt; contributed significantly. Additionally, neither Germany nor Japan planned to fight a protracted war, and were not equipped to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|BBSU|1998|p=84}}; {{Harvnb|Lindberg|Todd|2001|p=126}}..&lt;/ref&gt; To improve their production, Germany and Japan used millions of [[slave labour]]ers;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Unidas|first=Naciones|title=World Economic And Social Survey 2004: International Migration|page=23|publisher=United Nations Pubns|year=2005|isbn=978-92-1-109147-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|Germany used]] about 12 million people, mostly from Eastern Europe,&lt;ref name="compensation"/&gt; while [[Slavery in Japan|Japan used]] more than 18 million people in Far East Asia.&lt;ref name="zhifen2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="indonesiaww2"/&gt;

=== Advances in technology and warfare ===
{{Main|Technology during World War II}}
[[File:Boeing-Whichata B-29 Assembly Line - 1944.jpg|thumb|[[Boeing B-29 Superfortress|B-29 Superfortress]] [[strategic bombers]] on the [[Boeing]] assembly line in [[Wichita, Kansas]], 1944]]

Aircraft were used for [[Reconnaissance aircraft|reconnaissance]], as [[fighter aircraft|fighters]], [[bomber]]s, and [[close air support|ground-support]], and each role was advanced considerably. Innovation included [[airlift]] (the capability to quickly move limited high-priority supplies, equipment, and personnel);&lt;ref name="EncWWII_76"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tucker|Roberts|2004|p=76}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and of [[strategic bombing]] (the bombing of enemy industrial and population centres to destroy the enemy's ability to wage war).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Levine|1992|p=227}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anti-aircraft warfare|Anti-aircraft weaponry]] also advanced, including defences such as [[radar]] and surface-to-air artillery. The use of the [[jet aircraft]] was pioneered and, though late introduction meant it had little impact, it led to jets becoming standard in air forces worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Klavans|Di Benedetto|Prudom|1997}}; {{Harvnb|Ward|2010|pp=247–51}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[Missile|guided missiles]] were being developed, they were not advanced enough to reliably [[Surface-to-air missile|target aircraft]] until some years after the war.

Advances were made in nearly every aspect of [[naval warfare]], most notably with aircraft carriers and submarines. Although [[Aeronautics|aeronautical]] warfare had relatively little success at the start of the war, [[Battle of Taranto|actions at Taranto]], [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]], and the [[Battle of the Coral Sea|Coral Sea]] established the carrier as the dominant capital ship in place of the battleship.&lt;ref name="EncWWII_163"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tucker|Roberts|2004|p=163}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Bishop|first1=Chris|last2=Chant|first2=Chris|title=Aircraft Carriers: The World's Greatest Naval Vessels and Their Aircraft|page=7|publisher=Silverdale Books|year=2004|isbn=978-1-84509-079-1|location=Wigston, Leics}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Chenoweth|first1=H.

The British focused development on [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine]] [[anti-submarine weapon|weaponry]] and tactics, such as [[sonar]] and convoys, while Germany focused on improving its offensive capability, with designs such as the [[German Type VII submarine|Type VII submarine]] and [[Wolfpack (naval tactic)|wolfpack]] tactics.&lt;ref name="Bur&amp;Ryd 1995 16"&gt;{{Harvnb|Burcher|Rydill|1995|p=16}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Gradually, improving Allied technologies such as the [[Leigh light]], [[Hedgehog (weapon)|hedgehog]], [[Squid (weapon)|squid]], and [[Mark 24 mine|homing torpedoes]] proved victorious.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

[[Land warfare]] changed from the static front lines of [[trench warfare]] of World War&amp;nbsp;I, which had relied on improved [[artillery]] that outmatched the speed of both [[infantry]] and [[cavalry]], to increased mobility and [[combined arms]]. The [[tank]], which had been used predominantly for infantry support in the First World War, had evolved into the primary weapon.&lt;ref name="EncWWII_125"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tucker|Roberts|2004|p=125}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1930s, tank design was considerably more advanced than it had been during World War I,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Dupuy|first=Trevor Nevitt|title=The Evolution of Weapons and Warfare|publisher=[[Jane's Information Group]]|isbn=978-0-7106-0123-0|year=1982|page=231}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tanks in World War II|advances continued throughout the war]] with increases in speed, armour and firepower.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} At the start of the war, most commanders thought enemy tanks should be met by tanks with superior specifications.&lt;ref name="EncWWII_108"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tucker|Roberts|2004|p=108}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This idea was challenged by the poor performance of the relatively light early tank guns against armour, and German doctrine of avoiding tank-versus-tank combat. This, along with Germany's use of combined arms, were among the key elements of their highly successful blitzkrieg tactics across Poland and France.&lt;ref name="EncWWII_125"/&gt; Many means of [[anti-tank warfare|destroying tanks]], including [[Indirect fire|indirect artillery]], [[anti-tank gun]]s (both towed and [[self-propelled gun|self-propelled]]), [[anti-tank mine|mines]], short-ranged infantry antitank weapons, and other tanks were used.&lt;ref name="EncWWII_108" /&gt; Even with large-scale mechanisation, infantry remained the backbone of all forces,&lt;ref name="EncWWII_734"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tucker|Roberts|2004|p=734}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and throughout the war, most infantry were equipped similarly to World War&amp;nbsp;I.&lt;ref name="Comp_221"&gt;{{Harvnb|Cowley|Parker|2001|p=221}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The portable machine gun spread, a notable example being the German [[MG34]], and various [[submachine gun]]s which were suited to [[close combat]] in urban and jungle settings.&lt;ref name="Comp_221" /&gt; The [[assault rifle]], a late war development incorporating many features of the rifle and submachine gun, became the standard postwar infantry weapon for most armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The AK-47: the worlds favourite killing machine |publisher=controlarms.org |first=Oliver |last=Sprague |first2=Hugh |last2=Griffiths |url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/act30/011/2006/en/ |accessdate=14 November 2009 |year=2006 |format=PDF |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most major belligerents attempted to solve the problems of complexity and security involved in using large [[codebook]]s for [[cryptography]] by designing [[cipher]]ing machines, the most well known being the German [[Enigma machine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ratcliff|2006|p=11}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Development of [[SIGINT]] (''sig''nals ''int''elligence) and [[cryptanalysis]] enabled the countering process of decryption.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3659">'''Yahya ibn Zikrawayh''', also known under his [[assumed name]] '''Sahib al-Naqa''' ("Master of the She-camel"), was a [[Qarmatian]] leader in the [[Syrian Desert]] in the early years of the 10th century.

Yahya was the eldest son of the Qarmatian leader [[Zikrawayh ibn Mihrawayh]], and a descendant of the seventh [[Isma'ili]] [[imam]], [[Muhammad ibn Isma'il]]. His name made direct allusion to [[John the Baptist]] (known as Yahya ibn Zakariyya in [[Islam]]), but he also assumed the title of "''Sahib al-Naqa''" ("Master of the She-camel") and claimed to be the awaited [[Mahdi]] under the name "Muhammad ibn Abdallah".{{sfn|Brett|2001|p=65}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|pp=286–287}} Along with his brother [[al-Husayn ibn Zikrawayh|Husayn]] Yahya established a base of operations at [[Palmyra]]. The brothers were successful in gaining the support of many local [[Bedouin]]—especially from the [[Banu Kalb]], thus acquiring a potent military force.{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|pp=286–287}} 

From this base they began launching raids against the [[Abbasid]] and [[Tulunid]] provinces of [[Bilad al-Sham|Syria]], with devastating effect. In 902, the Qarmatians defeated the Tulunids under [[Tughj ibn Juff]] near [[Raqqa]], and laid siege to [[Damascus]]. The city was successfully held by Tughj, and Yahya was killed. Leadership passed to his brother, who assumed the title "Man with the Mole", and led the Qarmatians until his defeat, capture and execution after the [[Battle of Hama]] in November 903.{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=286}}{{sfn|Brett|2001|pp=65–66}}{{sfn|Rosenthal|1985|pp=136–144}} 

Zikrawayh, the brothers' father, also rebelled in 906 near [[Kufa]] but was killed in the next year during an attack on the ''[[hajj]]'' caravan. With these defeats, the Qarmatian movement virtually ceased to exist in the Syrian Desert, although their counterparts in [[Bahrayn (historical region)|Bahrayn]] remained an active threat for several decades to come.{{sfn|Rosenthal|1985|pp=158–168}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|pp=185, 286}}{{sfn|Brett|2001|p=66}}
