The '''16th century''' begins with the [[Julian calendar|Julian]] year [[1501]] and ends with either the Julian or the [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]] year [[1600]] (depending on the reckoning used; the Gregorian calendar introduced a lapse of 10 days in October 1582).&lt;ref&gt;Modern reference works on the period tend to follow the introduction of the Gregorian calendar for the sake of clarity; thus [http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEhelp/calendar.html NASA's lunar eclipse catalogue] states "The Gregorian calendar is used for all dates from 1582 Oct 15 onwards. Before that date, the Julian calendar is used." For dates after 15 October 1582, care must be taken to avoid confusion of the two styles.
&lt;/ref&gt;

The 16th century is regarded by historians as the century in which the rise of [[Western civilization|the West]] occurred.
During the 16th century, [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]] explored the world's seas and opened worldwide oceanic trade routes. Large parts of the [[New World]] became Spanish and Portuguese colonies, and while the Portuguese became the masters of Asia's and Africa's Indian Ocean trade, the Spanish opened trade across the Pacific Ocean, linking the Americas with Asia.

This era of [[colonialism]] established [[mercantilism]] as the leading school of economic thought, where the economic system was viewed as a [[zero-sum game]] in which any gain by one party required a loss by another.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ekelund|Tollison|1981|p=9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The mercantilist [[doctrine]] encouraged the many intra-European wars of the period and arguably fueled European [[expansionism|expansion]] and [[imperialism]] throughout the world until the [[19th century]] or early [[20th century]].

In [[Europe]], the [[Protestant Reformation]] gave a major blow to the authority of the [[Pope|papacy]] and the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. European politics became dominated by religious conflicts, with the groundwork for the epochal [[Thirty Years' War]] being laid towards the end of the century. In [[Italy]], [[Luca Pacioli]] published the first work ever on [[accounting]] and [[Galileo Galilei]] made the first thermometer. In [[Kingdom of England|England]], the Italian [[Alberico Gentili]] wrote the first book on public international law and divided secularism from canon law and Roman Catholic theology.

In the [[Middle East]], the [[Ottoman Empire]] continued to expand, with the [[Sultan]] taking the title of [[Caliph]], while dealing with a resurgent Persia. Iran and Iraq were caught by major popularity of the [[Shia Islam|Shiite]] sect of [[Islam]] under the rule of the [[Safavid dynasty]] of warrior-mystics, providing grounds for a Persia independent of the majority-[[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] [[Muslim world]].

China evacuated the coastal areas, because of Japanese piracy. Japan was suffering a severe civil war at the time, known as the [[Sengoku period]]. Elsewhere in Asia, [[Mughal Emperor]] [[Akbar]] extended the power of the [[Mughal Empire]] to cover most of the southern lands of the continent. His rule significantly influenced arts and culture in the region.

[[Copernicus]] proposed the [[heliocentrism|heliocentric universe]], which was met with strong resistance, and [[Tycho Brahe]] refuted the theory of [[celestial spheres]] through observational measurement of the [[SN 1572|1572 appearance]] of a [[Milky Way]] [[supernova]]. These events directly challenged the long-held notion of an immutable universe supported by [[Ptolemy]] and [[Aristotle]], and led to major revolutions in [[astronomy]] and [[scientific revolution|science]].

==About Abjjad==
Abjjad was designed in Arabic to attract Arabic readers and authors to a one [[social network]]. It also aims to provide an accurate and enormous database for [[Arabic books]] and authors.&lt;ref name="test4"&gt;[http://arablit.wordpress.com/2014/03/11/abjjad-an-arabic-social-network-for-books-with-a-big-vision/ Abjjad: An Arabic Social Network for Books with a Big Vision.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Abjjad recommends a variety of 10 books each week and a weekly article written by one of the members.&lt;ref name="test4" /&gt; It also allows members to follow each other, or follow authors or books to receive notifications once a new review has been added about the books or new information was added in the writer page.&lt;ref name="test3" /&gt;

Abjjad is linked to [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] which provides Abjjad with an extensive database of English books making it easy for members to find English books. In addition, it includes more than 30 thousand Arabic books.

Members of Abjjad call themselves "Abjjadyeen" which created a brand for the website and helped in spreading it around the Middle East. The website is featured with the "Abjadyya" where members can use to filter what to appear on their timelines from members' status, book reviews or book ratings. The "Abjadyya" is a status a member can write and share with his followers where they can like and comment on it. Members of the website tend to use the word "Abjadyya" to refer to other members statuses.

Animism is the world's oldest religion, "Animism predates any form of organized religion and is said to contain the oldest spiritual and supernatural perspective in the world.

Animism is used in the [[anthropology of religion]] as a term for the belief system of many [[indigenous people]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ritual and Belief: Readings in the Anthropology of Religion|first=David|last=Hicks|publisher=[[Rowman Altamira]]|edition=3|year=2010|page=359|quote=Tylor's notion of animism—for him the first religion—included the assumption that early ''Homo sapiens'' had invested animals and plants with souls&amp;nbsp; ... }}&lt;/ref&gt; especially in contrast to the relatively more recent development of [[organised religion]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Animism|publisher=ELMAR Project (University of Cumbria)|date=1998–99|others=Contributed by Helen James; coordinated by Dr. Elliott Shaw with assistance from Ian Favell|url=http://www.philtar.ac.uk/encyclopedia/seasia/animism.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although each culture has its own different mythologies and rituals, "animism" is said to describe the most common, foundational thread of indigenous peoples' "spiritual" or "supernatural" perspectives. The animistic perspective is so widely held and inherent to most indigenous peoples that they often do not even have a word in their languages that corresponds to "animism" (or even "religion");&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Native American Religious and Cultural Freedom: An Introductory Essay|work=The Pluralism Project|publisher=President and Fellows of Harvard College and Diana Eck|year=2005|url=http://www.pluralism.org/reports/view/176}}&lt;/ref&gt; the term is an [[Emic and etic|anthropological construct]].

Largely due to such [[ethnolinguistic]] and cultural discrepancies, opinion has differed on whether ''animism'' refers to an ancestral mode of experience common to indigenous peoples around the world, or to a full-fledged religion in its own right. The currently accepted definition of animism was only developed in the late 19th century (1871) by Sir [[Edward Tylor]], who created it as "one of [[anthropology]]'s earliest concepts, if not the first".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bird-David|first=Nurit|title="Animism" Revisited: Personhood, Environment, and Relational Epistemology|journal=Current Anthropology|year=1999|volume=40|issue=S1|page=S67|doi=10.1086/200061}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Stephen|title=A New Kind of Science|publisher=Wolfram Media, Inc.|year=2002|page=1195|isbn=1-57955-008-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Animism encompasses the beliefs that all material phenomena have agency, that there exists no hard and fast distinction between the [[Spirituality|spiritual]] and physical (or material) world and that [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] or [[spirit]] or sentience exists not only in humans, but also in other animals, plants, rocks, geographic features such as mountains or rivers or other entities of the natural environment, including thunder, wind and shadows. Animism thus rejects [[Cartesian dualism]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} Animism may further attribute souls to abstract concepts such as words, [[true name]]s or metaphors in [[mythology]]. Some members of the non-tribal world also consider themselves animists (such as author [[Daniel Quinn]], sculptor [[Lawson Oyekan]] and many contemporary [[Modern Paganism|Pagans]]).&lt;ref name="Harvey"&gt;{{cite book|title=Animism: Respecting the Living World|last=Harvey|first=Graham|page=9|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2006|url=https://books.google.com/?id=q2np2LCDmIMC&amp;printsec=frontcover|isbn=978-0-231-13700-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theories ==
=== Old animism ===
Earlier anthropological perspectives, which have since been termed the "old animism", were concerned with knowledge on what is alive and what factors make something alive.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=xi}} The "old animism" assumed that animists were individuals who were unable to understand the difference between [[persons]] and [[object (philosophy)|things]].{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=xiv}}
Critics of the "old animism" have accused it of preserving "colonialist and dualist worldviews and rhetoric".{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=xii}}

==== Edward Tylor's definition ====
[[File:Edward Burnett Tylor.jpg|thumb|[[Edward Tylor]] developed animism as an anthropological theory.]]

The idea of animism was developed by the [[anthropology|anthropologist]] Sir [[Edward Burnett Tylor|Edward Tylor]] in his 1871 book ''Primitive Culture'',{{sfnp|EB|1878}} in which he defined it as "the general doctrine of souls and other spiritual beings in general". According to Tylor, animism often includes "an idea of pervading life and will in nature";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Sir Edward Burnett Tylor| title = Primitive Culture: Researches Into the Development of Mythology, Philosophy, Religion, Art, and Custom| url = https://books.google.com/?id=AucLAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA260| year = 1871| publisher = J. Murray| isbn = | page = 260 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a belief that natural objects other than humans have souls. That formulation was little different from that proposed by [[Auguste Comte]] as "[[fetishism]]",&lt;ref name="Kuper 2005 85"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kuper|first=Adam|title=Reinvention of Primitive Society: Transformations of a Myth (2nd Edition)|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|location=Florence, KY, USA|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the terms now have distinct meanings.

For Tylor, animism represented the earliest form of religion, being situated within an evolutionary framework of religion which has developed in stages and which will ultimately lead to humanity rejecting religion altogether in favor of scientific rationality.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=6}}
Thus, for Tylor, animism was fundamentally seen as a mistake, a basic error from which all religion grew.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=6}} He did not believe that animism was inherently illogical, but he suggested that it arose from early humans' dreams and visions and thus was a rational system. However, it was based on erroneous, unscientific observations about the nature of reality.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=8}} Stringer notes that his reading of ''Primitive Culture'' led him to believe that Tylor was far more sympathetic in regard to "primitive" populations than many of his contemporaries and that Tylor expressed no belief that there was any difference between the intellectual capabilities of "savage" people and Westerners.&lt;ref name=stringer /&gt;

Tylor had initially wanted to describe the phenomenon as "spiritualism" but realised that would cause confusion with the modern religion of [[Spiritualism]], that was then prevalent across Western nations.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=7}} He adopted the term "animism" from the writings of the German scientist [[Georg Ernst Stahl]],{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=5}} who, in 1708, had developed the term ''{{lang|la|animismus}}'' as a [[biology|biological]] theory that [[soul (spirit)|souls]] formed the [[vital principle]] and that the normal phenomena of life and the abnormal phenomena of disease could be traced to spiritual causes.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|pp=3–4}} The first known usage in English appeared in 1819.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bird-David|first=Nurit|title="Animism" Revisited: Personhood, Environment, and Relational Epistemology|journal=Current Anthropology|year=1999|volume=40|issue=S1|pages=S67–S68|doi=10.1086/200061}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea that there had once been "one universal form of primitive religion" (whether labelled "animism", "totemism", or "shamanism") has been dismissed as "unsophisticated" and "erroneous" by the archaeologist [[Timothy Insoll]], who stated that "it removes complexity, a precondition of religion now, in ''all'' its variants".{{sfn|Insoll|2004|p=29}}

==== Social evolutionist conceptions ====
Tylor's definition of animism was a part of a growing international debate on the nature of "primitive society" by lawyers, theologians and philologists. The debate defined the field of research of a new science: anthropology. By the end of the 19th century, an orthodoxy on "primitive society" had emerged, but few anthropologists still would accept that definition. The "19th-century armchair anthropologists" argued "primitive society" (an evolutionary category) was ordered by kinship and was divided into exogamous [[kinship|descent groups]] related by a series of marriage exchanges. Their religion was animism, the belief that natural species and objects had souls. With the development of private property, the descent groups were displaced by the emergence of the territorial state. These rituals and beliefs eventually evolved over time into the vast array of "developed" religions. According to Tylor, the more scientifically advanced a society became, the fewer members of that society believed in animism. However, any remnant ideologies of souls or spirits, to Tylor, represented "survivals" of the original animism of early humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kuper|first=Adam|title=The Invention of Primitive Society: Transformations of an Illusion|year=1988|publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul|location=London|pages=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1869 (three years after Tylor proposed his definition of animism), the Edinburgh lawyer, [[John Ferguson McLennan]], argued that the animistic thinking evident in [[fetishism]] gave rise to a religion he named [[Totemism]]. Primitive people believed, he argued, that they were descended of the same species as their totemic animal.&lt;ref name="Kuper 2005 85" /&gt; Subsequent debate by the 'armchair anthropologists' (including [[Johann Jakob Bachofen|J. J. Bachofen]], [[Émile Durkheim]] and [[Sigmund Freud]]) remained focused on [[totemism]] rather than animism, with few directly challenging Tylor's definition. Indeed, anthropologists "have commonly avoided the issue of Animism and even the term itself rather than revisit this prevalent notion in light of their new and rich [[ethnographies]]."&lt;ref name="Bird-David 1999 S68"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bird-David|first=Nurit|title="Animism" Revisited: Personhood, Environment, and Relational Epistemology|journal=Current Anthropology|year=1999|volume=40|issue=S1|page=S68|doi=10.1086/200061}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the anthropologist [[Tim Ingold]], animism shares similarities to totemism but differs in its focus on individual spirit beings which help to perpetuate life, whereas totemism more typically holds that there is a primary source, such as the land itself or the ancestors, who provide the basis to life. Certain indigenous religious groups such as the [[Australian Aboriginals]] are more typically totemic, whereas others like the [[Inuit]] are more typically animistic in their worldview.&lt;ref&gt;Ingold, Tim. (2000). "Totemism, Animism and the Depiction of Animals" in ''The Perception of the Environment: Essays on Livelihood, Dwelling and Skill''. London: Routledge, pp.&amp;nbsp;112–113.&lt;/ref&gt;

From his studies into child development, [[Jean Piaget]] suggested that children were born with an innate animist worldview in which they anthropomorphized inanimate objects, and that it was only later that they grew out of this belief.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=14}} Conversely, from her ethnographic research, [[Margaret Mead]] argued the opposite, believing that children were not born with an animist worldview but that they became acculturated to such beliefs as they were educated by their society.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=14}}
Stewart Guthrie saw animism – or "attribution" as he preferred it – as an evolutionary strategy to aid survival. He argued that both humans and other animal species view inanimate objects as potentially alive as a means of being constantly on guard against potential threats.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=15}} His suggested explanation, however, did not deal with the question of why such a belief became central to religion.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=16}}

In 2000, Guthrie suggested that the "most widespread" concept of animism was that it was the "attribution of spirits to natural phenomena
such as stones and trees".{{sfn|Guthrie|2000|p=106}}

=== The new animism ===

Many anthropologists ceased using the term "animism", deeming it to be too close to early anthropological theory and religious polemic.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=xii}} However, the term had also been claimed by religious groups – namely indigenous communities and [[nature worship]]ers – who felt that it aptly described their own beliefs, and who in some cases actively identified as "animists".{{sfn|Harvey|2005|pp=xii, 3}} It was thus readopted by various scholars, however they began using the term in a different way,{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=xii}} placing the focus on knowing how to behave toward other persons, some of whom aren't human.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=xi}} As the religious studies scholar Graham Harvey stated, while the "old animist" definition had been problematic, the term "animism" was nevertheless "of considerable value as a critical, academic term for a style of religious and cultural relating to the world."{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=xv}}

[[File:Hombres ojibwe.jpg|thumb|left|Five [[Ojibwe]] chiefs in the 19th century; it was anthropological studies of Ojibwe religion that resulted in the development of the "new animism".]]
The "new animism" emerged largely from the publications of the anthropologist [[Alfred Irving Hallowell|Irving Hallowell]] which were produced on the basis of his ethnographic research among the [[Ojibwe]] communities of Canada in the mid-20th century.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=17}} For the Ojibwe encountered by Hallowell, ''[[personhood]]'' did not require human-likeness, but rather humans were perceived as being like other persons, who for instance included rock persons and bear persons.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=18}} For the Ojibwe, these persons were each wilful beings who gained meaning and power through their interactions with others; through respectfully interacting with other persons, they themselves learned to "act as a person".{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=18}} Hallowell's approach to the understanding of Ojibwe personhood differed strongly from prior anthropological concepts of animism.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=19}} He emphasized the need to challenge the modernist, Western perspectives of what a person is by entering into a dialogue with different worldwide-views.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=18}}

Hallowell's approach influenced the work of anthropologist Nurit Bird-David, who produced a [[Academic journal#Scholarly articles|scholarly article]] reassessing the idea of animism in 1999.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=20}} Seven comments from other academics were provided in the journal, debating Bird-David's ideas.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=21}}

More recently post-modern anthropologists are increasingly engaging with the concept of animism. Modernism is characterized by a Cartesian subject-object dualism that divides the subjective from the objective, and culture from nature; in this view, Animism is the inverse of [[scientism]], and hence inherently invalid. Drawing on the work of [[Bruno Latour]], these anthropologists question these modernist assumptions, and theorize that all societies continue to "animate" the world around them, and not just as a Tylorian survival of primitive thought. Rather, the instrumental reason characteristic of modernity is limited to our "professional subcultures," which allows us to treat the world as a detached mechanical object in a delimited sphere of activity. We, like animists, also continue to create personal relationships with elements of the so-called objective world, whether pets, cars or teddy-bears, who we recognize as subjects. As such, these entities are "approached as communicative subjects rather than the inert objects perceived by modernists."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hornborg|first=Alf|title=Animism, fetishism, and objectivism as strategies for knowing (or not knowing) the world|journal=Ethnos|year=2006|volume=71|issue=1|pages=22–4|doi=10.1080/00141840600603129}}&lt;/ref&gt; These approaches are careful to avoid the modernist assumptions that the environment consists dichotomously of a physical world distinct from humans, and from modernist conceptions of the person as composed dualistically as body and soul.&lt;ref name="Bird-David 1999 S68" /&gt;

Nurit Bird-David argues that "Positivistic ideas about the meaning of 'nature', 'life' and 'personhood' misdirected these previous attempts to understand the local concepts. Classical theoreticians (it is argued) attributed their own modernist ideas of self to 'primitive peoples' while asserting that the 'primitive peoples' read their idea of self into others!"&lt;ref name="Bird-David 1999 S68" /&gt; She argues that animism is a "relational epistemology", and not a Tylorian failure of primitive reasoning. That is, self-identity among animists is based on their relationships with others, rather than some distinctive feature of the self. Instead of focusing on the essentialized, modernist self (the "individual"), persons are viewed as bundles of social relationships ("dividuals"), some of which are with "superpersons" (i.e. non-humans).

Guthrie expressed criticism of Bird-David's attitude toward animism, believing that it promulgated the view that "the world is in large measure whatever our local imagination makes it". This, he felt, would result in anthropology abandoning "the scientific project".{{sfn|Guthrie|2000|p=107}}

Tim Ingold, like Bird-David, argues that animists do not see themselves as separate from their environment: "Hunter-gatherers do not, as a rule, approach their environment as an external world of nature that has to be 'grasped' intellectually&amp;nbsp; ... indeed the separation of mind and nature has no place in their thought and practice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ingold|first=Tim|title=The Perception of the Environment: Essays in Livelihood, Dwelling and Skill|year=2000|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Willerslev extends the argument by noting that animists reject this [[Cartesian dualism]], and that the animist self identifies with the world, "feeling at once ''within'' and ''apart'' from it so that the two glide ceaselessly in and out of each other in a sealed circuit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Willerslev|first=Rane|title=Soul Hunters: Hunting, Animism and personhood among the Siberian Yukaghirs|year=2007|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The animist hunter is thus aware of himself as a human hunter, but, through mimicry is able to assume the viewpoint, senses, and sensibilities of his prey, to be one with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Willerslev|first=Rane|title=Soul Hunters: Hunting, Animism and personhood among the Siberian Yukaghirs|year=2007|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shamanism]], in this view, is an everyday attempt to influence spirits of ancestors and animals by mirroring their behaviours as the hunter does his prey.

Cultural ecologist and philosopher [[David Abram]] articulates and elaborates an intensely ethical and ecological form of animism grounded in the [[Phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenology]] of sensory experience. In his books ''Becoming Animal'' and ''The Spell of the Sensuous,'' Abram suggests that material things are never entirely passive in our direct experience, holding rather that perceived things actively "solicit our attention" or "call our focus," coaxing the perceiving body into an ongoing participation with those things. In the absence of intervening technologies, sensory experience is inherently animistic, disclosing a material field that is animate and self-organizing from the get-go. Drawing upon contemporary cognitive and natural science, as well as upon the perspectival worldviews of diverse indigenous, oral cultures, Abram proposes a richly pluralist and story-based cosmology, in which matter is alive through and through. Such an ontology is in close accord, he suggests, with our spontaneous perceptual experience; it would draw us back to our senses and to the primacy of the sensuous terrain,  enjoining a more respectful and ethical relation to the more-than-human community of animals, plants, soils, mountains, waters and weather-patterns that materially sustains us.&lt;ref&gt;Abram, David ''The Spell of the Sensuous: Perception and Language in a More-than-Human World'', Pantheon, 1996; Vintage 1997: {{ISBN|978-0-679-77639-0}} and Abram, David: ''Becoming Animal: An Earthly Cosmology'' Pantheon, 2010; Vintage 2011: {{ISBN|978-0-375-71369-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast to a long-standing tendency in the Western social sciences, which commonly provide rational explanations of animistic experience, Abram develops an animistic account of reason itself. He holds that civilized reason is sustained only by an intensely animistic participation between human beings and their own written signs. Indeed, as soon as we turn our gaze toward the alphabetic letters written on a page or a screen, these letters speak to us—we 'see what they say'—much as ancient trees and gushing streams and lichen-encrusted boulders once spoke to our oral ancestors. Hence reading is an intensely concentrated form of animism, one that effectively eclipses all of the other, older, more spontaneous forms of participation in which we once engaged. "To tell the story in this manner—to provide an animistic account of reason, rather than the other way around—is to imply that animism is the wider and more inclusive term, and that oral, mimetic modes of experience still underlie, and support, all our literate and technological modes of reflection. When reflection's rootedness in such bodily, participatory modes of experience is entirely unacknowledged or unconscious, reflective reason becomes dysfunctional, unintentionally destroying the corporeal, sensuous world that sustains it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Abram|first=David|title=The Spell of the Sensuous|year=1996|publisher=Pantheon|location=New York|page=303}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The religious studies scholar Graham Harvey defined animism as the belief "that the world is full of persons, only some of whom are human, and that life is always lived in relationship with others".{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=xi}} He added that it is therefore "concerned with learning how to be a good person in respectful relationships with other persons".{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=xi}}
Graham Harvey, in his 2013 Handbook of Contemporary Animism, identifies the animist perspective in line with Martin Buber's "I-thou" as opposed to "I-it". In such, Harvey says, the Animist takes an I-thou approach to relating to his world, where objects and animals are treated as a "thou" rather than as an "it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harvey|first=Graham|title=The Handbook of Contemporary Animism|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fetishism/totemism ===

In many animistic world views, the human being is often regarded as on a roughly equal footing with other animals, plants, and natural forces.&lt;ref&gt;Fernandez-Armesto, p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shamanism ===

{{Main|Shamanism}}
A shaman is a person regarded as having access to, and influence in, the world of [[Evocation|benevolent and malevolent spirits]], who typically enters into a [[trance]] state during a [[ritual]], and practices [[divination]] and [[healing]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/shaman?view=uk Oxford Dictionary Online].&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mircea Eliade, shamanism encompasses the premise that shamans are intermediaries or messengers between the human world and the spirit worlds. Shamans are said to treat ailments/illness by mending the soul. Alleviating traumas affecting the soul/spirit restores the physical body of the individual to balance and wholeness. The shaman also enters [[otherworld|supernatural realms]] or [[Plane (esotericism)|dimensions]] to obtain solutions to problems afflicting the community. Shamans may visit other worlds/dimensions to bring guidance to misguided souls and to ameliorate illnesses of the human soul caused by foreign elements. The shaman operates primarily within the spiritual world, which in turn affects the human world. The restoration of balance results in the elimination of the ailment.&lt;ref name = Eli72&gt;Mircea Eliade, ''Shamanism, Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy'', Bollingen Series LXXVI, Princeton University Press 1972, pp. 3–7.&lt;/ref&gt; Abram, however, articulates a less supernatural and much more ecological understanding of the shaman's role than that propounded by Eliade. Drawing upon his own field research in Indonesia, Nepal, and the Americas, Abram suggests that in animistic cultures, the shaman functions primarily as an intermediary between the human community and the more-than-human community of active agencies — the local animals, plants, and landforms (mountains, rivers, forests, winds and weather patterns, all of whom are felt to have their own specific sentience). Hence the shaman's ability to heal individual instances of dis-ease (or imbalance) within the human community is a by-product of her/his more continual practice of balancing the reciprocity between the human community and the wider collective of animate beings in which that community is embedded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Abram|first=David|title=The Spell of the Sensuous|year=1996|publisher=Pantheon|location=New York|pages=3–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Distinction from pantheism ===
Animism is not the same as [[pantheism]], although the two are sometimes confused. Some religions are both pantheistic and animistic. One of the main differences is that while animists believe everything to be spiritual in nature, they do not necessarily see the spiritual nature of everything in existence as being united (monism), the way pantheists do. As a result, animism puts more emphasis on the uniqueness of each individual soul. In pantheism, everything shares the same spiritual essence, rather than having distinct spirits and/or souls.&lt;ref&gt;Paul A. Harrison ''Elements of Pantheism'' 2004, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carl McColman ''When Someone You Love Is Wiccan: A Guide to Witchcraft and Paganism for Concerned Friends, Nervous parents and Curious Co-Workers'' 2002, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;

== Animist life ==

=== Animals, plants, and the elements ===

Animism entails the belief that "all living things have a soul", and thus a central concern of animist thought surrounds how animals can be eaten or otherwise used for humans' subsistence needs.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=99}} The actions of non-human animals are viewed as "intentional, planned and purposive",{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=101}} and they are understood to be persons because they are both alive and communicate with others.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=100}} In animist world-views, non-human animals are understood to participate in [[kinship]] systems and ceremonies with humans, as well as having their own kinship systems and ceremonies.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=102}} Harvey cited an example of an animist understanding of animal behaviour that occurred at a [[powwow]] held by the [[Conne River]] [[Mi'kmaq]] in 1996; an eagle flew over the proceedings, circling over the central drum group. The assembled participants called out ''kitpu'' ("eagle"), conveying welcome to the bird and expressing pleasure at its beauty, and they later articulated the view that the eagle's actions reflected its approval of the event and the Mi'kmaq's return to traditional spiritual practices.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|pp=102–103}}

Some animists also view plant and fungi life as persons and interact with them accordingly.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=104}} The most common encounter between humans and these plant and fungi persons is with the former's collection of the latter for food, and for animists this interaction typically has to be carried out respectfully.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=106}} Harvey cited the example of Maori communities in New Zealand, who often offer ''[[karakia]]'' invocations to [[sweet potatoes]] as they dig the latter up; while doing so there is an awareness of a kinship relationship between the Maori and the sweet potatoes, with both understood as having arrived in [[Aotearoa]] together in the same canoes.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=106}} In other instances, animists believe that interaction with plant and fungi persons can result in the communication of things unknown or even otherwise unknowable.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=104}} Among some modern Pagans, for instance, relationships are cultivated with specific trees, who are understood to bestow knowledge or physical gifts, such as flowers, sap, or wood that can be used as firewood or to fashion into a [[wand]]; in return, these Pagans give offerings to the tree itself, which can come in the form of [[libation]]s of mead or ale, a drop of blood from a finger, or a strand of wool.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|pp=104–105}}

Various animistic cultures also comprehend as stones as persons.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|pp=106–107}} Discussing ethnographic work conducted among the Ojibwe, Harvey noted that their society generally conceived of stones as being inanimate, but with two notable exceptions: the stones of the [[Bell Rocks]] and those stones which are situated beneath trees struck by lightning, which were understood to have become Thunderers themselves.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=107}} The Ojibwe conceived of weather as being capable of having personhood, with storms being conceived of as persons known as 'Thunderers' whose sounds conveyed communications and who engaged in seasonal conflict over the lakes and forests, throwing lightning at lake monsters.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=107}} Wind, similarly, can be conceived as a person in animistic thought.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|pp=108–109}}

The importance of place is also a recurring element of animism, with some places being understood to be persons in their own right.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=109}}

=== Spirits ===

Animism can also entail relationships being established with non-corporeal [[spirit]] entities.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=122}}

== Other usages ==

=== Science and animism ===
In the early 20th century, [[William McDougall (psychologist)|William McDougall]] defended a form of Animism in his book ''Body and Mind: A History and Defence of Animism'' (1911).

The physicist [[Nick Herbert (physicist)|Nick Herbert]] has argued for "quantum animism" in which mind permeates the world at every level.

{{quote|The quantum consciousness assumption, which amounts to a kind of "quantum animism" likewise asserts that consciousness is an integral part of the physical world, not an emergent property of special biological or computational systems. Since everything in the world is on some level a quantum system, this assumption requires that everything be conscious on that level. If the world is truly quantum animated, then there is an immense amount of invisible inner experience going on all around us that is presently inaccessible to humans, because our own inner lives are imprisoned inside a small quantum system, isolated deep in the meat of an animal brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Nick|last= Herbert|authorlink=Nick Herbert (physicist)|title= Holistic Physics – or – An Introduction to Quantum Tantra|date=2002|accessdate=2014-05-01 |url=http://www.southerncrossreview.org/16/herbert.essay.htm|publisher=southerncrossreview.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Werner Krieglstein]] wrote regarding his quantum Animism:

{{quote|Herbert's quantum Animism differs from traditional Animism in that it avoids assuming a dualistic model of mind and matter. Traditional dualism assumes that some kind of spirit inhabits a body and makes it move, a ghost in the machine. Herbert's quantum Animism presents the idea that every natural system has an inner life, a conscious center, from which it directs and observes its action.&lt;ref&gt;Werner J. Krieglstein ''Compassion: A New Philosophy of the Other'' 2002, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Ashley Curtis has argued in ''Error and Loss: A Licence to Enchantment''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Error and Loss: A Licence to Enchantment|last=Curtis|first=Ashley|publisher=Kommode Verlag|year=2018|isbn=978-3952462690|location=Zürich|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the Cartesian idea of an experiencing subject facing off with an inert physical world is incoherent at its very foundation, and that this incoherence is predicted rather than belied by Darwinism. Human reason (and its rigorous extension in the natural sciences) fits an evolutionary niche just as echolocation does for bats and infrared vision does for pit vipers, and is—according to western science's own dictates—epistemologically on a par with rather than superior to such capabilities. The meaning or aliveness of the "objects" we encounter—rocks, trees, rivers, other animals—thus depends for its validity not on a detached cognitive judgment but purely on the quality of our experience. The animist experience, and, indeed, the wolf's or raven's experience, thus become licenced as equally valid world-views to the modern western scientific one—indeed, they are more valid, since they are not plagued with the incoherence that inevitably crops up when "objective existence" is separated from "subjective experience."

=== Socio-political impact ===

Harvey opined that animism's views on personhood represented a radical challenge to the dominant perspectives of [[modernity]], because it accords "intelligence, rationality, consciousness, volition, agency, intentionality, language and desire" to non-humans.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=xviii}} Similarly, it challenges the view of human uniqueness that is prevalent in both [[Abrahamic religion]]s and Western [[rationalism]].{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=xix}}

=== In art and literature ===
Animist beliefs can also be expressed through artwork.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=50}} For instance, among the Maori communities of New Zealand, there is an acknowledgment that creating art through carving wood or stone entails violence against the wood or stone person, and that the persons who are damaged therefore have to be placated and respected during the process; any excess or waste from the creation of the artwork is returned to the land, while the artwork itself is treated with particular respect.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=55}} Harvey therefore argued that the creation of art among the Maori was not about creating an inanimate object for display, but rather a transformation of different persons within a relationship.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=64}}

Harvey expressed the view that animist worldviews were present in various works of literature, citing such examples as the writings of [[Alan Garner]], [[Leslie Silko]], [[Barbara Kingsolver]], [[Alice Walker]], [[Daniel Quinn]],  [[Linda Hogan]], [[David Abram]],  [[Patricia Grace]], [[Chinua Achebe]], [[Ursula Le Guin]], [[Louise Erdrich]], and [[Marge Piercy]].{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=xxiii}} Animist worldviews have also been identified in the animated films of [[Hayao Miyazaki]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/spirits-gods-and-pastel-paints-the-weird-world-of-master-animator-hayao-miyazaki-1880974.html|title=Spirits, gods and pastel paints: The weird world of master animator Hayao Miyazaki|author=Robert Epstein|date=January 31, 2010|publisher=The Independent|access-date=June 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kyotojournal.org/the-journal/culture-arts/musings-on-miyazaki-early-and-late-2/|title=Musings on Miyazaki|author=Dr. David A.

'''Art Nouveau''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɑː|r|t|_|n|uː|ˈ|v|oʊ|,_|ˌ|ɑː|r}}; {{IPA-fr|aʁ nuvo|lang}})  is an international [[style (visual arts)|style]] of art, architecture and [[applied art]], especially the [[decorative arts]], that was most popular between 1890 and 1910.&lt;ref&gt;Sterner (1982), 6.&lt;/ref&gt;  A reaction to the [[academic art]] of the 19th century, it was inspired by natural forms and structures, particularly the curved lines of plants and flowers.

English uses the French name Art Nouveau (new art).  The style is related to, but not identical with,  styles that emerged in many countries in Europe at about the same time:  in Austria it is known as ''[[Vienna Secession|Secessionsstil]]'' after ''[[Wiener Secession]]''; in Spanish ''Modernismo''; in Catalan ''[[Modernisme]]''; in Czech ''Secese''; in Danish ''Skønvirke'' or ''Jugendstil''; in German ''Jugendstil'', Art Nouveau or ''Reformstil''; in Hungarian ''Szecesszió''; in Italian Art Nouveau, ''Stile Liberty'' or  ''Stile floreale''; in Lithuanian ''Modernas''; in Norwegian ''Jugendstil''; in Polish ''Secesja''; in Slovak ''Secesia''; in Ukrainian and Russian ''Модерн'' (Modern)&lt;!--''Ар-нуво'' [Ar-nuvo] or ''Югендстиль'' [JUgendstil']--&gt;; in Swedish and Finnish ''Jugend''.

Art Nouveau is a [[gesamtkunstwerk|total art style]]: It embraces a wide range of fine and decorative arts, including architecture, painting, graphic art, interior design, jewelry, [[Art Nouveau furniture|furniture]], textiles, ceramics, glass art, and metal work. 

By 1910, Art Nouveau was already out of style. It was replaced as the dominant European architectural and decorative style first by [[Art Deco]] and then by [[Modernism]].&lt;ref&gt;Henry R. Hope, review of H. Lenning, ''The Art Nouveau'', ''The Art Bulletin'', vol. 34 (June 1952), 168–171 (esp. 168–169): Discussing the state of Art Nouveau during 1952, the author notes that Art Nouveau, which had become disfavored, was not yet an acceptable study for serious art history or a subject suitable for major museum exhibitions and their respective catalogs. He predicts an impending change, however.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="grove"&gt;Michèle Lavallée, "Art Nouveau", ''[[Grove Dictionary of Art]]'', [[Oxford University Press]] [accessed 11 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Naming==
Art Nouveau took its name from the ''Maison de l'Art Nouveau'' (''House of the New Art''), an art gallery opened in 1895 by the Franco-German [[art dealer]] [[Siegfried Bing]] that featured the new style. In France, Art Nouveau was also sometimes called by the British term "Modern Style" due to its roots in the [[Arts and Crafts movement]], ''Style moderne'', or ''Style 1900.''&lt;ref name="duncan23" /&gt; It was also sometimes called ''Style Jules Verne'', ''Le Style Métro'' (after Hector Guimard's iron and glass subway entrances), ''Art Belle Époque'', and ''Art fin de siècle''.&lt;ref name="Gontar, Cybele 2006" /&gt;

In Belgium, where the architectural movement began, it was sometimes termed ''Style nouille'' (noodle style) or ''Style coup de fouet'' (whiplash style).&lt;ref name="Gontar, Cybele 2006" /&gt;

In Britain, it was known as the ''Modern Style'', or, because of the Arts and Crafts movement led by [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]] in Glasgow,  as the [[Glasgow School|"Glasgow" style]].

In Italy, because of the popularity of designs from London's [[Liberty (department store)|Liberty &amp; Co]] department store (mostly designed by [[Archibald Knox (designer)|Archibald Knox]]), it was sometimes called the ''Stile Liberty'' ("Liberty style"),  ''Stile floral'', or ''Arte nova'' (New Art).

In the United States, due to its association with [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]], it was often called the "Tiffany style".&lt;ref name="grove" /&gt;&lt;ref name="grove" /&gt;&lt;ref name="duncan23" /&gt;&lt;ref name="duncan23"&gt;Duncan (1994): 23–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany and Scandinavia, a related style emerged at about the same time; it was called ''Jugendstil'', after the popular German art magazine of that name.&lt;ref name="Gontar, Cybele 2006" /&gt;  In Austria and the neighboring countries then part of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], a similar style emerged, called ''Secessionsstil'' in German, ({{lang-hu|szecesszió}}, {{lang-cs|secese}}) or ''Wiener Jugendstil'', after the artists of the [[Vienna Secession]].

The style was called ''Modern'' (Модерн) in Russia and ''Nieuwe Kunst'' (new art) in the Netherlands.&lt;ref name="grove" /&gt;&lt;ref name="duncan23" /&gt; In Spain the related style was known as ''Modernismo'', ''Modernisme'' (in Catalan), ''Arte joven'' ("young art"); and in Portugal ''Arte nova'' (new art). 

Some names refer specifically to the organic forms that were popular with the Art Nouveau artists: ''Stile Floreal'' ("floral style") in France; ''Paling Stijl'' ("eel style") in the Netherlands;  and ''Wellenstil'' ("wave style") and ''Lilienstil'' ("lily style") in Germany.&lt;ref name="duncan23" /&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The new art movement had its roots in Britain, in the floral designs of [[William Morris]], and in the [[Arts and Crafts movement]] founded by the pupils of Morris. Early prototypes of the style include the Red House of Morris (1859), and the lavish [[Peacock Room]] by [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]]. The new movement was also strongly influenced by the [[Pre-Raphaelite]] painters, including [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] and [[Edward Burne-Jones]], and especially by British graphic artists of the 1880s, including [[Selwyn Image]], [[Heywood Sumner]], [[Walter Crane]], [[Alfred Gilbert]], and especially [[Aubrey Beardsley]].&lt;ref&gt;Bouillon, Jean-Paul, ''Journal de l'Art Nouveau'' (1985), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, the style combined several different tendencies. In architecture, it was influenced by the architectural theorist and historian [[Eugène Viollet-le-Duc]], a declared enemy of the historical [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts architectural style]]. In his 1872 book ''Entretiens sur l'architecture'', he wrote, "use the means and knowledge given to us by our times, without the intervening traditions which are no longer viable today, and in that way we can inaugurate a new architecture. For each function its material; for each material its form and its ornament."&lt;ref&gt;Viollet le-Duc, ''Entretiens sur l'architecture''&lt;/ref&gt;  This book influenced a generation of architects, including [[Louis Sullivan]], [[Victor Horta]], [[Hector Guimard]], and [[Antoni Gaudí]].{{Sfn|Bouillon|1985|page=24}}

The French painters [[Maurice Denis]], [[Pierre Bonnard]] and [[Édouard Vuillard]] played an important part in integrating fine arts painting with decoration. "I believe that before everything a painting must decorate", Denis wrote in 1891. "The choice of subjects or scenes is nothing. It is by the value of tones, the colored surface and the harmony of lines that I can reach the spirit and wake up the emotions."&lt;ref&gt;Interview in ''L'Écho de Paris'', 28 December 1891, cited in Bouillon (1985)&lt;/ref&gt;  These painters all did both traditional painting and decorative painting on screens, in glass, and in other media.{{Sfn|Bouillon|1985|page=26}}

Another important influence on the new style was [[Japonism]]: the wave of enthusiasm for Japanese [[woodblock printing]], particularly the works of [[Hiroshige]], [[Hokusai]], and [[Utagawa Kunisada]] which were imported into Europe beginning in the 1870s. The enterprising [[Siegfried Bing]] founded a monthly journal, ''Le Japon artistique'' in 1888, and published thirty-six issues before it ended in 1891. It influenced both collectors and artists, including [[Gustav Klimt]]. The stylized features of Japanese prints appeared in Art Nouveau graphics, porcelain,  jewelry, and furniture.

New technologies in printing and publishing allowed Art Nouveau to quickly reach a global audience. Art magazines, illustrated with photographs and color [[lithographs]], played an essential role in popularizing the new style. ''[[The Studio (magazine)|The Studio]]'' in England, ''Arts et idèes'' and ''Art et décoration'' in France, and ''[[Jugend]]'' in Germany allowed the style to spread rapidly to all corners of Europe. [[Aubrey Beardsley]] in England, and [[Eugène Grasset]], [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]], and [[Félix Vallotton]] achieved international recognition as illustrators.{{Sfn|Lahor|2007|page=30}}

With the posters by [[Jules Cheret]] for dancer [[Loie Fuller]] in 1893, and by [[Alphonse Mucha]] for actress [[Sarah Bernhardt]] in 1895, the poster became not just advertising, but an art form. [[Toulouse-Lautrec]] and other artists achieved international celebrity status.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The Franco-German art dealer and publisher [[Siegfried Bing]] played a key role in publicizing the style. In 1891, he founded a magazine devoted to the art of Japan, which helped publicize [[Japonism]] in Europe. In 1892, he organized an exhibit of seven artists, among them [[Pierre Bonnard]], [[Félix Vallotton]], [[Édouard Vuillard]], [[Toulouse-Lautrec]] and [[Eugène Grasset]], which included both modern painting and decorative work. This exhibition was shown at the [[Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts|Société nationale des beaux-arts]] in 1895. In the same year, Bing opened a new gallery at [[Rue de Provence|22 rue de Provence]] in Paris, the ''[[Maison de l'Art Nouveau]]'', devoted to new works in both the fine and decorative arts. The interior and furniture of the gallery were designed by the Belgian architect [[Henry Van de Velde]], one of the pioneers of Art Nouveau architecture. The ''Maison de l'Art Nouveau'' showed paintings by [[Georges Seurat]], [[Paul Signac]] and [[Toulouse-Lautrec]], glass from [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]] and [[Emile Gallé]], jewelry by [[René Lalique]], and posters by [[Aubrey Beardsley]]. The works shown there were not at all uniform in style. Bing wrote in 1902, "Art Nouveau, at the time of its creation, did not aspire in any way to have the honor of becoming a generic term. It was simply the name of a house opened as a rallying point for all the young and ardent artists impatient to show the modernity of their tendencies."{{Sfn|Bouillon|1985}}

===Beginning of Art Nouveau architecture (1893–1898)===

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The first Art Nouveau houses, the [[Hôtel Tassel]] by Victor Horta and the [[Bloemenwerf]] house by [[Henry Van de Velde]], were built in Brussels in 1893–1895. Both Horta and Van de Velde designed not only the houses, but also all of the interior decoration, furniture, carpets, and architectural details.

Horta, an architect with classical training, designed the residence of a prominent Belgian chemist, Émile Tassel, on a very narrow and deep site. The central element became the stairway, beneath a high skylight. The floors were supported by slender iron columns like the trunks of trees. The mosaic floors and walls were decorated with delicate arabesques in floral and vegetal forms, which became the most popular signature of Art Nouveau.{{Sfn|Lahor|2007|page=127}}

Van de Velde was by training a designer, not an architect, and collaborated with an architect on the plan of the [[Bloemenwerf]], the house that he built for himself. He was inspired by the British Arts and Crafts Movement, particularly William Morris's Red House, and like them he designed all aspects of the building, including the furniture, wallpaper and carpets.

After visiting Horta's Hôtel Tassel, [[Hector Guimard]] built the [[Castel Béranger]], the first Paris building in the new style, between 1895 and 1898. Parisians had been complaining of the monotony of the architecture of the boulevards built under [[Napoleon III]] by [[Georges-Eugène Haussmann]]. They welcomed Guimard's colorful and picturesque style; the Castel Béranger was chosen as one of the best new façades in Paris, launching Guimard's career. Guimard was given the commission to design the entrances for the new [[Paris Métro]] system, which brought the style to the attention of the millions of visitors to the city's 1900 [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|''Exposition Universelle'']].&lt;ref name="Gontar, Cybele 2006"&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/artn/hd_artn.htm Gontar, Cybele.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The Paris 1900 [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|''Exposition universelle'']] marked the high point of Art Nouveau. Between April and November 1900, it attracted nearly fifty million visitors from around the world, and showcased the architecture, design, glassware, furniture and decorative objects of the style. The architecture of the Exposition was often a mixture of Art Nouveau and [[Beaux-Arts architecture]]: the main exhibit hall, the [[Grand Palais]] had a Beaux-Arts façade completely unrelated to the spectacular Art Nouveau stairway and exhibit hall in the interior.

The Exposition particularly highlighted French designers, who all made special works for the Exhibition: [[Lalique]] crystal and jewelry; jewelry by [[Henri Vever]] and [[Georges Fouquet]]; [[Daum (studio)|Daum]] glass; the [[Manufacture nationale de Sèvres]] in [[porcelain]]; ceramics by [[Alexandre Bigot]]; sculpted glass lamps and vases by [[Emile Gallé]] and [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]], and Company from the United States; furniture by [[Édouard Colonna]] and [[Louis Majorelle]]; and many other prominent arts and crafts firms from around Europe and the world. At the 1900 Paris Exposition, [[Siegfried Bing]] presented a pavilion called '' Art Nouveau Bing'', which featured six different interiors entirely decorated in the Style.&lt;ref name="eidelberg"&gt;Martin Eidelberg and Suzanne Henrion-Giele, "Horta and Bing: An Unwritten Episode of L'Art Nouveau", ''The Burlington Magazine'', vol. 119, Special Issue Devoted to European Art Since 1890 (Nov. 1977), pp. 747–752.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="duncanbing"&gt;Duncan (1994), pp. 15–16, 25–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Paris Exposition was by far the largest, other expositions did much to popularize the style. The [[1888 Barcelona Universal Exposition]] marked the beginning of the [[Modernisme]] style in Spain, with some buildings of [[Lluís Domènech i Montaner]]. The [[Esposizione Internazionale d'Arte Decorativa Moderna (1902)|''Esposizione internazionale d'arte decorativa moderna'']] of 1902 in [[Turin]], Italy, showcased designers from across Europe.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Following the 1900 Exposition, the capital of Art Nouveau was Paris. The most extravagant residences in the style were built by [[Jules Lavirotte]], who entirely covered the façades with ceramic sculptural decoration. The most flamboyant example is the [[Lavirotte Building]], at 29 avenue Rapp (1901). Office buildings and department stores featured high courtyards covered with stained glass cupolas and ceramic decoration. The style was particularly popular in restaurants and cafés, including ''[[Maxim's]]'' at [[Rue Royale, Paris|3 rue Royale]], and [[Le Train Bleu (restaurant)|''Le Train bleu'']] at the [[Gare de Lyon]] (1900).{{Sfn|Texier|2012|pages=86–87}}

The city of [[Nancy, France|Nancy]] in [[Lorraine]] became the other French capital of the new style. In 1901, the ''Alliance provinciale des industries d'art'', also known as the ''[[École de Nancy]]'', was founded, dedicated to upsetting the hierarchy that put painting and sculpture above the decorative arts.  The major artists working there included the glass vase and lamp creators [[Emile Gallé]], the [[Daum (studio)|Daum]] brothers in glass design, and the designer [[Louis Majorelle]], who created furniture with graceful floral and vegetal forms. The architect [[Henri Sauvage]] brought the new architectural style to Nancy with his [[Villa Majorelle]] in 1898.

The French style was widely propagated by new magazines, including ''The Studio'', ''Arts et Idées'' and ''Art et Décoration'', whose photographs and color lithographs made the style known to designers and wealthy clients around the world.

In France, the style reached its summit in 1900, and thereafter slipped rapidly out of fashion,  virtually disappearing from France by 1905. Art Nouveau was a luxury style, which required expert and highly-paid craftsmen, and could not be easily or cheaply mass-produced. One of the few Art Nouveau products that could be mass-produced was the perfume bottle, and these continue to be manufactured in the style today.

Belgium was an early center of the Art Nouveau, thanks largely to the architecture of [[Victor Horta]], who designed the first Art Nouveau houses, the [[Hôtel Tassel]] in 1893, and the [[Hôtel Solvay]] in 1894. Horta met and had a strong influence on the work of the young [[Hector Guimard]]. Other important designers included architect [[Paul Hankar]], who built an Art Nouveau house in 1893; the architect and furniture designer [[Henry van de Velde]], the decorator [[Gustave Serrurier-Bovy]], and the graphic artist [[Fernand Khnopff]].&lt;ref&gt;Lahor, ''L'Art Nouveau'', p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="unescohorta"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1005|title=Major Town Houses of the Architect Victor Horta (Brussels)|first=UNESCO World Heritage|last=Centre|website=whc.unesco.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sterner (1982), pp. 38–42.&lt;/ref&gt;  Belgian designers took advantage of an abundant supply of [[ivory]] imported from the [[Belgian Congo]]; mixed sculptures, combining stone, metal and ivory, by such artists as [[Philippe Wolfers]], was popular.{{Sfn|Riley|2004|page=323}}

In the Netherlands, the style was known as the ''Nieuwe Kunst'', the New Art. Architects included [[Hendrik Petrus Berlage]], who designed a more functional, rational variant, while [[Carel Adolph Lion Cachet]], [[Theo Nieuwenhuis]] and [[Gerrit Willem Dijsselhof]] designed a more picturesque and decorative style. Furniture design was influenced by the importation of exotic woods from the Dutch East Indies (modern [[Indonesia]]), while textiles were influenced by the designs and techniques of [[batik]].{{Sfn|Riley|2004|page=323}}

Prominent Swiss artists of the period included painter and graphic artist [[Théophile Steinlen]], creator of the famous poster for the Paris [[cabaret]] [[Le Chat Noir|''Le Chat noir'']], and the artist, sculptor and decorator [[Eugène Grasset]], who moved from Switzerland to Paris where he designed graphics, furniture, tapestries, ceramics and posters. In Paris, he taught at the Guérin school of art (''École normale d'enseignement du dessin''), where his students included [[Augusto Giacometti]] and [[Paul Berthon]].&lt;ref&gt;Lahor, ''L'Art Nouveau'', p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="duncan37"&gt;Duncan (1994), p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Art Nouveau had its roots in Britain, in the [[arts and crafts movement]] of the 1880s, which called for a closer union between the fine arts and decorative arts, and a break away from historical styles to designs inspired by function and nature. One notable early example [[Arthur Mackmurdo]]'s design for the cover of his essay on the city churches of [[Sir Christopher Wren]], published in 1883.

Other important innovators in Britain included the graphic designers [[Aubrey Beardsley]] whose drawings featured the curved lines which became the most recognizable feature of the style. free-flowing [[wrought iron]] from the 1880s could also be adduced, or some flat floral textile designs, most of which owed some impetus to patterns of 19th century design. Other British graphic artists who had an important place in the style included [[Walter Crane]] and [[Charles Robert Ashbee|Charles Ashbee]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huntfor.com/arthistory/c19th/artnouveau.htm|title=Art Nouveau - Art Nouveau Art|date=22 February 2013|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130222070337/http://www.huntfor.com/arthistory/c19th/artnouveau.htm|archivedate=22 February 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Liberty (department store)|Liberty]] department store in London played an important role, through its colorful stylized floral designs for textiles, and the silver, pewter, and jewelry designs of Manxman (of Scottish descent) [[Archibald Knox (designer)|Archibald Knox]]. His jewelry designs in materials and forms broke away entirely from the historical traditions of jewelry design.

For Art Nouveau architecture and furniture design, the most important center in Britain was [[Glasgow, Scotland|Glasgow]], with the creations of [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]] and the [[Glasgow School]], whose work was inspired by the French Art Nouveau, Japanese art, symbolism and Gothic revival. Beginning in 1895, Mackintosh displayed his designs at international expositions in London, Vienna, and Turin; his designs particularly influenced the Secession Style in Vienna. His architectural creations included the Glasgow Herald Building (1894) and the library of the [[Glasgow School of Art]] (1897). He also established a major reputation as a furniture designer and decorator, working closely with his wife, [[Margaret Macdonald Mackintosh]], a prominent painter and designer. Together they created striking designs which combined geometric straight lines with gently curving floral decoration, particularly a famous symbol of the style, the ''Glasgow Rose".{{Sfn|Lahor|page=160}}

[[Léon-Victor Solon]], made an important contribution to Art Nouveau ceramics as art director at Mintons. He specialised in plaques and in [[Tubelining|tube-lined]] vases marketed as "secessionist ware" (usually described as named after the [[Viennese Secession|Viennese art movement]]).&lt;ref name="Muter"&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=41809144 | title=Leon Solon and John Wadsworth | work=Journal of the Decorative Arts Society | year=1985 | author=Muter, Grant}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Apart from ceramics, he designed textiles for the [[Thomas Wardle (industrialist)|Leek silk industry]]&lt;ref&gt;He was commissioned by the Wardle family of dyers and printers, trading as "Thomas Wardle &amp; Co" and "Bernard Wardle and Co".[http://www.whitworth.manchester.ac.uk/collection/recentprojects/wardle/ The Wardel Pattern Books Revealed]{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203044031/http://www.whitworth.manchester.ac.uk/collection/recentprojects/wardle/ |date=3 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[doublure (bookbinding)|doublure]]s for a bookbinder (G.T.Bagguley of Newcastle under Lyme), who patented the ''Sutherland'' binding in 1895.

The Edward Everard building in Bristol, built during 1900–01 to house the [[Former Everard's Printing Works|printing works of Edward Everard]], features an Art Nouveau façade. The figures depicted are of [[Johannes Gutenberg]] and [[William Morris]], both eminent in the field of printing. A winged figure symbolises the "Spirit of Light", while a figure holding a lamp and mirror symbolises light and truth.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
German Art Nouveau is commonly known by its German name, ''Jugendstil''. The name is taken from the artistic journal, ''[[Jugend (magazine)|Die Jugend]]'', which was published in Munich and which espoused the new artistic movement. It was founded in 1896 by [[Georg Hirth]] (Hirth remained editor until his death in 1916, and the magazine continued to be published until 1940). The magazine was instrumental in promoting the style in Germany. As a result, its name was adopted as the most common German-language term for the style: ''Jugendstil'' ("youth style"). Although, during the early 20th century, the word was applied to only two-dimensional examples of the graphic arts,&lt;ref&gt;A. Philip McMahon, "review of F. Schmalenbach, ''Jugendstil''", ''Parnassus'', vol. 7 (Oct., 1935), 27.&lt;/ref&gt; especially the forms of organic [[typography]] and [[graphic design]] found in and influenced by German magazines like ''[[Jugend (magazine)|Jugend]]'', ''[[Pan (magazine)|Pan]]'', and ''[[Simplicissimus]]'', it is now applied to more general manifestations of Art Nouveau visual arts in Germany, the [[Netherlands]], the [[Baltic states]], and [[Nordic countries]].&lt;ref name="grove" /&gt;&lt;ref name="heller"&gt;Reinhold Heller, "Recent Scholarship on Vienna's "Golden Age", Gustav Klimt, and Egon Schiele", ''The Art Bulletin'', vol. 59 (Mar., 1977), pp. 111–118.&lt;/ref&gt; The two main centres for Jugendstil art in Germany were [[Munich]] and [[Darmstadt]] ([[Darmstadt Artists' Colony|Mathildenhöhe]]).

Two other journals, ''[[Simplicissimus]]'', published in Munich, and ''[[Pan (magazine)|Pan]]'', published in Berlin, proved to be important proponents of the Jugendstil. The magazines were important for spreading the visual idiom of ''Jugendstil'', especially the graphical qualities. Jugendstil art includes a variety of different methods, applied by the various individual artists and features the use of hard lines as well as sinuous curves. Methods range from classic to romantic. One feature of Jugendstil is the typography used, the letter and image combination of which is unmistakable. The combination was used for covers of novels, advertisements, and [[Art exhibition|exhibition]] [[poster]]s. Designers often used unique display [[typeface]]s that worked harmoniously with the image.

One of the most famous German artists associated with both ''Die Jugend'' and ''Pan'' was [[Otto Eckmann]]. His favourite animal was the swan, and such was his influence in the German movement that the swan came to serve as the [[leitmotif]] for the Jugendstil.

One of the most prominent German designers in the style was [[Richard Riemerschmid]], who made furniture, pottery, and other decorative objects in a sober, geometric style that pointed forward toward Art Deco.{{Sfn|Lahor|2007|page=52}}

{{Main article|Vienna Secession}}
Vienna became the center of a distinct variant of Art Nouveau, which became known as the [[Vienna Secession]], an art movement that was founded in April 1897 by a group of artists which included [[Gustav Klimt]], [[Koloman Moser]], [[Josef Hoffmann]], [[Joseph Maria Olbrich]], [[Max Kurzweil]], and [[Otto Wagner]]. The painter Klimt became the president of the group. They objected to the conservative orientation toward [[historicism]] expressed by [[Vienna Künstlerhaus]], the official union of artists. The Secession founded a magazine, ''[[Ver Sacrum]]'', to promote their works in all media. The Secession style was notably more feminine, less heavy and less nationalist than the ''Jugendstil'' in neighboring Germany.{{Sfn|Lahor|2007|page=63}} The architect Joseph Olbrich designed the domed Secession building in the new style, which became a showcase for the paintings of Gustav Klimt and other Secession artists. The architectural style of the Vienna Secession had an influence well beyond the city. Buildings in the style appeared in the other major cities of the Empire and beyond; one of the most famous examples is the [[Stoclet Palace]] built by Josef Hoffmann in Brussels in 1905–11. The interior is entirely decorated in Secession style, including notable paintings by Gustav Klimt.

Klimt became the best-known of the Secession painters, often erasing the border between fine art painting and decorative painting. [[Koloman Moser]] was an extremely versatile artist in the style; his work including magazine illustrations, architecture, silverware, ceramics, porcelain, textiles, stained glass windows, furniture, and more. He often worked in collaboration with Hoffmann and Klimt; the three together created the interiors, furnishing and even clothing to be worn in the Stoclet Palace in Brussels. In 1903, he and Hoffmann founded the [[Wiener Werkstätte]], a training school and workshop for designers and craftsmen of furniture, carpets, textiles and decorative objects.{{Sfn|Lahor|2007|page=120}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
In the capitals of Central Europe, then ruled by the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]] in Vienna, national forms of Art Nouveau are quick to appear, and often took on historical or folkloric elements. The furniture designs of [[Ödön Faragó]] in [[Budapest]] ([[Hungary]]) combined traditional popular architecture, oriental architecture and international Art Nouveau in a highly picturesque style. [[Pál Horti]], another Hungarian designer, had a much more sober and functional style, made of oak with delicate traceries of ebony and brass.

[[Prague]], in the [[Czech Republic]], has a notable collection of Art Nouveau architecture, including the ''Hotel Central'' and the [[Jubilee Synagogue]], built in 1908.

The style of combining Art Nouveau and national architectural elements was typical also for a [[Slovakia|Slovak]] architect [[Dušan Jurkovič]] who was under the influence of Hungarian Art Nouveau. His most original works are the Cultural House in [[Skalica]] in [[Slovakia]] (1905), buildings of spa in [[Luhačovice]] in the [[Czech Republic]] (1901–1903) and 35 war cemeteries near [[Nowy Żmigród]] in [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] (now Poland), most of them heavily influenced by local Lemko ([[Rusyns|Rusyn]]) folk art and carpentry (1915–1917). Another example of Secession architecture in Slovakia is the [[Church of St. Elisabeth (Bratislava)|Church of St. Elisabeth]] (The Little Blue Church) in [[Bratislava]].

Italy's ''Stile Liberty'' took its name from the British department store [[Liberty (store)|Liberty]], the colorful textiles of which were particularly popular in Italy. Notable Italian designers included [[Galileo Chini]], whose ceramics were inspired both by [[majolica]] patterns and by Art Nouveau. He was later known as a painter and a scenic designer; he designed the sets for two Puccini operas  ''[[Gianni Schicchi]]'' and ''[[Turandot]]''.

The [[Teatro Massimo]] in [[Palermo]], by the architect [[Ernesto Basile]], is an example of the Italian variant of the style, architectural style, which combined Art Nouveau and classical elements.

The most important figure in Italian Art Nouveau furniture design was [[Carlo Bugatti]], the son of an architect and sculptor, and brother of the famous automobile designer. He studied at the [[Brera Academy|Milanese Academy of Brera]], and later the [[Académie des Beaux-Arts]] in [[Paris]]. His work was distinguished by its exoticism and eccentricity, included silverware, textiles, ceramics, and musical instruments, but he is best remembered for his innovative furniture designs, shown first in the 1888 Milan Fine Arts Fair. His furniture often featured a keyhole design, and had unusual coverings, including parchment and silk, and inlays of bone and ivory. It also sometimes had surprising organic shapes, copied after snails and cobras.{{Sfn|Riley|2007|page=310}}

In Spain, a highly original variant of the style, Catalan ''[[Modernisme]]'', appeared in [[Barcelona]]. Its most famous creator was [[Antoni Gaudi|Antoni Gaudí]], who used Art Nouveau's floral and organic forms in a very novel way in ''[[Palau Güell]]'' (1886).{{Sfn|Lahor|2007|page=142}}&lt;ref&gt;James Grady, ''Special Bibliographical Supplement: A Bibliography of the Art Nouveau'', in "The Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians", vol. 14 (May, 1955), pp. 18–27.&lt;/ref&gt; His designs from about 1903, the ''[[Casa Batlló]]'' (1904–1906) and ''[[Casa Milà]]'' (1906–1908), are most closely related to the stylistic elements of Art Nouveau.&lt;ref name="duncan52"&gt;Duncan (1994): 52.&lt;/ref&gt; However, famous structures such as the ''[[Sagrada Família]]'' characteristically contrast the modernising Art Nouveau tendencies with revivalist [[Neo-Gothic]].&lt;ref name="duncan52" /&gt; Besides the dominating presence of Gaudí, [[Lluís Domènech i Montaner]] also used Art Nouveau in Barcelona in buildings such as the [[Castell dels Tres Dragons]] (1888), [[Palau de la Música Catalana]] and [[Casa Lleó Morera]] (1905).&lt;ref name="duncan52" /&gt; Another major modernista was [[Josep Puig i Cadafalch]], who designed the [[Casa Martí]] and its Quatre Gats café, the Casimir Casaramona textile factory (now the [[Caixa Forum|CaixaFòrum]] art museum), Casa Macaya, [[Casa Amatller]], the Palau del Baró de Quadras (housing Casa Àsia for 10 years until 2013) and the Casa de les Punxes ("House of Spikes"). Also well-known is [[Josep Maria Jujol]], with houses in [[Sant Joan Despí]] (1913–1926), several churches near [[Tarragona]] (1918 and 1926) and the sinuous Casa Planells (1924) in [[Barcelona]]. A few other major architects working outside of Barcelona were Lluís Muncunill i Parellada, with a magnificent textile factory in [[Terrassa]] (Vapor Aymerich, Amat i Jover, now the Science and Technology Museum of Catalonia – Museu de la Ciència i de la Tècnica de Catalunya) and a "farmhouse"/small manor house called Masia Freixa in the same city; and [[Cèsar Martinell i Brunet]], with his spectacular "wine cathedrals", housing town cooperative wineries throughout southern and central [[Catalonia]]. A [[Valencian Country|Valencian]] architect who worked in Catalonia before emigrating to the [[United States|States]] was [[Rafael Guastavino]]. Attributed to him is the Asland Cement Factory in [[Castellar de n'Hug]], among other buildings.

The Catalan furniture designer Gaspar Homar (1870–1953), influenced by Antoni Gaudí, often combining marquetry and mosaics with his furnishings.{{Sfn|Riley|2007|page=311}} Examples of Art Nouveau (''Arte nova''), based largely on the French model, appeared in Portugal in [[Porto]] and [[Aveiro, Portugal|Aveiro]].  A notable example is the '[[Livraria Lello]]' bookstore in [[Porto]], designed by Xavier Esteves (1906).

Art Nouveau was popular in the [[Nordic countries]], where it was usually known as [[Jugendstil]], and was often combined with the [[National Romantic Style]] of each country. In [[Norway]] the Art Nouveau was connected with a revival inspired by [[Viking]] folk art and crafts. Notable designers included Lars Kisarvik, who designed chairs with traditional Viking and [[Celts|Celtic]] patterns, and [[Gerhard Munthe]], who designed a chair with a stylized dragon-head emblem from ancient Viking ships, as well as a wide variety of posters, paintings and graphics.{{Sfn|Riley|2007|page=312}} Other examples include the [[Skien Church]] (1887–1894) and [[Fagerborg Church]] in [[Kristiania]] (Oslo) (1900–1903).

In [[Finland]], good examples are the [[Helsinki Central railway station]], designed by [[Eliel Saarinen]], father of the famous American modernist architect [[Eero Saarinen]]. Examples of the style include the [[Finnish National Theatre]], [[Kallio Church]], the [[Finnish National Museum]], and [[Tampere Cathedral]]. In contrast to the very elaborate furniture of the Norwegian Art Nouveau, Finnish Art Deco was extremely simple and functional, as in the chairs designed by Eliel Saarinen (1907-1908).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitfinland.com/article/the-charm-of-old-helsinki/|title=The Charm of Old Helsinki — VisitFinland.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artnouveau.eu/en/city.php?id=136|title=Art Nouveau European Route : Cities|website=www.artnouveau.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A very colorful Russian variation of Art Nouveau appeared in Moscow and [[Saint Petersburg]] in 1898 with the publication of a new art journal, "Мир искусства" (transliteration: ''[[Mir Iskusstva]]'') ("The World of Art"), by Russian artists [[Alexandre Benois]] and [[Léon Bakst]], and chief editor [[Sergei Diaghilev]]. The magazine organized exhibitions of leading Russian artists, including [[Mikhail Vrubel]], [[Konstantin Somov]], [[Isaac Levitan]], and the book illustrator [[Ivan Bilibin]]. The World of Art style made less use of the vegetal and floral forms of French Art Nouveau; it drew heavily upon the bright colors and exotic designs of Russian folklore and fairy tales. The most influential contribution of the "World of Art" was the creation by Diaghilev of a new ballet company, the ''[[Ballets Russes]]'', headed by Diaghilev, with costumes and sets designed by Bakst and Benois. The new ballet company premiered in Paris in 1909, and performed there every year through 1913. The exotic and colorful sets designed by Benois and Bakst had a major impact on French art and design. The costume and set designs were reproduced in the leading Paris magazines, ''[[L'Illustration]]'', [[La Vie Parisienne (magazine)|''La Vie parisienne'']] and [[Gazette du Bon Ton|''Gazette du bon ton'']], and the Russian style became known in Paris as ''à la Bakst''. The company was stranded in Paris first by the outbreak of World War I, and then by the [[Russian Revolution]] in 1917, and ironically never performed in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan, Alistair, ''Art déco'', Thames and Hudson (1988), pp. 147–48&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Moscow]] and [[Saint Petersburg]] have several prominent Art Nouveau buildings constructed in the last years before the Revolution; notably the [[Hotel Metropol (Moscow)|Hotel Metropol]] in Moscow, which features a ceramic mural on the façade, ''The Princess of Dreams'', by scenic designer [[Mikhail Vrubel]];  and the [[Vitebsk Railway Station]] in Saint Petersburg (1904)

===Tiffany Style in the United States===

&lt;/gallery&gt;
In the United States, the firm of [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]] played a central role in American Art Nouveau. Born in 1848, he studied at the [[National Academy Museum and School|National Academy of Design]] in New York, began working with glass at the age of 24, entered the family business started by his father, and 1885 set up his own enterprise devoted to fine glass, and developed new techniques for its coloring. In 1893, he began making glass vases and bowls, again developing new techniques that allowed more original shapes and coloring, and began experimenting with decorative window glass. Layers of glass were printed, marbled and superimposed, giving an exceptional richness and variety of color In 1895 his new works were featured in the Art Nouveau gallery of Siegfried Bing, giving him a new European clientele. After the death of his father in 1902, he took over the entire Tiffany enterprise, but still devoted much of his time to designing and manufacturing glass art objects. At the urging of [[Thomas Edison]], he began to manufacture electric lamps with multicolored glass shades in structures of bronze and iron, or decorated with mosaics, produced in numerous series and editions, each made with the care of a piece of jewelry. A team of designers and craftsmen worked on each product. The Tiffany lamp in particular became one of the icons of the Art Nouveau, but Tiffany's craftsmen (and craftswomen) designed and made extraordinary windows, vases, and other glass art. Tiffany's glass also had great success at the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|''1900 Exposition Universelle'']] in Paris; his stained glass window called the ''Flight of Souls'' won a gold medal.{{Sfn|Lahor|2007|page=167}}

Another important figure in American Art Nouveau was the architect [[Louis Sullivan]], best known as the architect of some of the first American iron-framed skyscrapers. At the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in Chicago, most famous for the neoclassical architecture of its renowned ''White City'', he designed a spectacular Art Nouveau entrance to the Transportation Building. The Columbian Exposition was also an important venue for Tiffany; a chapel he designed was shown at the Pavilion of Art and Industry. The Tiffany Chapel, along with one of the windows of Tiffany's home in New York, are now on display at the [[Charles Hosmer Morse Museum of American Art]] in [[Winter Park, Florida]].

==Form and character==
[[File:Théophile-Alexandre Steinlen - Tournée du Chat Noir de Rodolphe Salis (Tour of Rodolphe Salis' Chat Noir) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''La tournée du Chat noir de Rodolphe Salis'' (1896) by [[Théophile Steinlen]]]]

Although Art Nouveau acquired distinctly localised tendencies as its geographic spread increased, some general characteristics are indicative of the form. A description published in ''Pan'' magazine of [[Hermann Obrist]]'s wall hanging ''Cyclamen'' (1894) described it as "sudden violent curves generated by the crack of a whip", which became well known during the early spread of Art Nouveau.&lt;ref name="duncan27"&gt;Duncan (1994): 27–28.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, not only did the work itself become better known as ''The Whiplash'' but the term "whiplash" is frequently applied to the characteristic curves employed by Art Nouveau artists.&lt;ref name="duncan27" /&gt; Such decorative "whiplash" motifs, formed by dynamic, undulating, and flowing lines in a syncopated rhythm and asymmetrical shape, are found throughout the architecture, painting, sculpture, and other forms of Art Nouveau design.

The origins of Art Nouveau are sometimes attributed in the resistance of the artist [[William Morris]] to the cluttered compositions and the [[Gothic revival|revival]] tendencies of the 19th century and his theories that helped initiate the [[Arts and crafts movement]].&lt;ref name="duncan10"&gt;Duncan (1994): 10–13.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arthur Mackmurdo]]'s book-cover for ''[[Christopher Wren|Wren]]'s City Churches'' (1883), with its rhythmic floral patterns, is also sometimes described as the first realisation of Art Nouveau.&lt;ref name="duncan10" /&gt; About the same time, the flat perspective and strong colors of [[Ukiyo-e|Japanese wood block prints]], especially those of [[Katsushika Hokusai]], had a strong effect on the formulation of Art Nouveau.&lt;ref name="duncan14"&gt;Duncan (1994): 14–18.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Japonisme]]'' that was popular in Europe during the 1880s and 1890s was particularly influential on many artists with its organic forms and references to the natural world.&lt;ref name ="duncan14" /&gt; Besides being adopted by artists like [[Emile Gallé]] and [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]], Japanese-inspired art and design was championed by the businessmen [[Siegfried Bing]] and [[Arthur Lasenby Liberty]] at their stores&lt;ref&gt;Before opening the ''Maison de l'Art Nouveau'', Bing managed a shop specialising in items from Japan; after 1888, he promoted Japanism with his magazine [[Artistic Japan|''Le Japon artistique'']]: Duncan (1994): 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt; in Paris and London, respectively.&lt;ref name="duncan14" /&gt; &lt;!--If confirmed: "One of the first Art Nouveau paintings can be found at [[Roquetaillade castle]] (France). [[Viollet-le-Duc]] restored the castle during the 1850s, and, even though his ideal was to create a [[Gothic revival]], his [[fresco]] in the keep of the castle is a pure example of "pre" Art Nouveau style—organic movement and color. "--&gt;
[[File:Immeuble rue de l'église détail Porte.jpg|thumb|upright|Doorway at 24 place Etienne Pernet, ([[15th arrondissement of Paris|Paris 15e]]), 1905 Alfred Wagon, architect.]]

In architecture, [[hyperbola]]s and [[parabola]]s in windows, arches, and doors are common, and decorative [[:molding (decorative)|mouldings]] 'grow' into plant-derived forms. Like most design styles, Art Nouveau sought to harmonise its forms. The text above the Paris Metro entrance uses the qualities of the rest of the iron work in the structure.&lt;ref&gt;Sterner (1982), 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Art Nouveau in architecture and interior design eschewed the eclectic revival styles of the 19th century. Though Art Nouveau, designers selected and 'modernised' some of the more abstract elements of [[Rococo]] style, such as [[flame]] and [[Animal shell|shell]] textures, they also advocated the use of very stylised organic forms as a source of inspiration, expanding the 'natural' repertoire to use [[seaweed]], [[grass]]es, and insects. The softly-melding forms of 17th-century [[auricular style]], best exemplified in Dutch silverware, was another influence.

==Relationship with contemporary styles and movements==
[[File:Gustav Klimt, 1907, Adele Bloch-Bauer I, Neue Galerie New York.jpg|thumb|left|upright0.1||''[[Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I]]'' by [[Gustav Klimt]] (1907)]]
As an art style, Art Nouveau has affinities with the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelites]] and the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] styles, and artists like [[Aubrey Beardsley]], [[Alphonse Mucha]], [[Edward Burne-Jones]], [[Gustav Klimt]] and [[Jan Toorop]] could be classed in more than one of these styles. Unlike Symbolist painting, however, Art Nouveau has a distinctive appearance; and, unlike the [[artisan]]-oriented [[Arts and Crafts Movement]], Art Nouveau artists readily used new materials, machined surfaces, and [[abstraction]] in the service of pure design.

Art Nouveau did not eschew the use of machines, as the Arts and Crafts Movement did. For sculpture, the principal materials employed were glass and wrought iron, resulting in sculptural qualities even in architecture. Ceramics were also employed in creating editions of sculptures by artists such as [[Auguste Rodin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musee-rodin.fr/communication/images/CPrevejaponais_anglais.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726155845/http://www.musee-rodin.fr/communication/images/CPrevejaponais_anglais.pdf |archivedate=26 July 2011 |df=dmy }} Edmond Lachenal produced editions of Rodin's sculptures&lt;/ref&gt;

Art Nouveau architecture made use of many [[technology|technological]] innovations of the late 19th century, especially the use of exposed iron and large, irregularly shaped pieces of glass for architecture.
 
Art Nouveau tendencies were also absorbed into local styles. In [[Denmark]], for example, it was one aspect of ''Skønvirke'' ("aesthetic work"), which itself more closely relates to the [[Arts and Crafts style]].&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Opie, ''A Dish by Thorvald Bindesbøll'', in ''The Burlington Magazine'', vol. 132 (May, 1990), pp. 356.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Claire Selkurt, "New Classicism: Design of the 1920s in Denmark", in ''The Journal of Decorative and Propaganda Arts'', vol. 4 (Spring, 1987), pp. 16–29 (esp. 18 n. 4).&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, artists adopted many of the floral and organic motifs of Art Nouveau into the ''[[Młoda Polska]]'' ("Young Poland") style in [[Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;Danuta A. Boczar, ''The Polish Poster'', in ''Art Journal'', vol. 44 (Spring, 1984), pp. 16–27 (esp. 16).&lt;/ref&gt; ''Młoda Polska'', however, was also inclusive of other artistic styles and encompassed a broader approach to art, literature, and lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;Danuta Batorska, "Zofia Stryjeńska: Princess of Polish Painting", in ''Woman's Art Journal'', vol. 19 (Autumn, 1998–Winter, 1999), pp. 24–29 (esp. 24–25).&lt;/ref&gt;

The graphic arts flourished in the Art Nouveau period, thanks to new technologies of printing, particularly color [[lithography]] which allowed the mass production of color posters. Art was no longer confined to galleries, museums and salons; it could be found on Paris walls, and in illustrated art magazines, which circulated throughout Europe and to the United States. The most popular theme of Art Nouveau posters was women; women symbolizing glamour, modernity and beauty, often surrounded by flowers.

In Britain, the leading graphic artist in the Art Nouveau style was [[Aubrey Beardsley]] (1872-1898). He began with engraved book illustrations for ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'', then black and white illustrations for [[Salome]] by [[Oscar Wilde]] (1893), which brought him fame. In the same year, he began engraving illustrations and posters for the art magazine ''The Studio'', which helped publicize European artists such as [[Fernand Khnopff]] in Britain. The curving lines and intricate floral patterns attracted as much attention as the text. {{Sfn|Lahor|2007|page=99}}

The Swiss-French artist [[Eugène Grasset]] (1845-1917) was one of the first creators of French Art Nouveau posters. He helped decorate the famous cabaret [[Le Chat Noir|Le Chat noir]] in 1885 and made his first posters for the ''Fêtes de Paris''. He made a celebrated posters of [[Sarah Bernhardt]] in 1890, and a wide variety of book illustrations. The artist-designers [[Jules Chéret]], [[Georges de Feure]] and the painter [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]] all made posters for Paris theaters, cafés, dance halls cabarets. The [[Czechs|Czech]] artist [[Alphonse Mucha]] (1860–1939) arrived in Paris in 1888, and in 1895 made a poster for actress Sarah Bernhardt in the play ''[[Gismonda]]'' by [[Victorien Sardou]]. The success of this poster led to a contract to produce posters for six more plays by Bernhardt. Over the next four years, he also designed sets, costumes, and even jewelry for the actress.&lt;ref name="Johnston"&gt;''[http://www.mala.bc.ca/~Johnstoi/praguepage/muchalecture.htm An Introduction to the Work of Alphonse Mucha and Art Nouveau]'', lecture by [[Ian Johnston (academic)|Ian Johnston]] of [[Malaspina University-College]], [[Nanaimo]], British Columbia.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, Julie. H. [http://www.style2000.com/p05b.html "Recycling art"] style2000.com.&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the success of his theater posters, Mucha made posters for a variety of products, ranging from cigarettes and soap to beer biscuits, all featuring an idealized female figure with an hourglass figure.  He went on to design products, from jewelry to biscuit boxes, in his distinctive style. {{Sfn|Lahor|2007|page=112}}

In Vienna, the most prolific designer of graphics and posters was [[Koloman Moser]] (1868-1918), who actively participated in the Secession movement with [[Gustav Klimt]] and [[Josef Hoffmann]], and made illustrations and covers for the magazine of the movement, ''Ver Sacrum'', as well as paintings, furniture and decoration.{{Sfn|Lahor|pages=120-121}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Painting was another important domain of Art Nouveau, though most Art Nouveau painters were also associated with other art movements, particularly the [[Nabis]] in France and the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolists]] in France and Austria. In 1892, [[Siegfried Bing]] organized an exhibition in Paris featuring seven painters, including [[Pierre Bonnard]], [[Édouard Vuillard]], [[Félix Vallotton]], and [[Maurice Denis]]; and his ''Maison de l'Art Nouveau'' exhibited paintings by [[Georges Seurat]], [[Paul Signac]], and [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]]. [[Eugène Grasset]], [[Koloman Moser]] and [[Gustav Klimt]] moved comfortably in the avant-garde and Art Nouveau. In Belgium, [[Fernand Khnopff]] worked in both painting and graphic design. Paintings by Gustav Klimt were an integral part of he decorative scheme of [[Josef Hoffmann]] for the [[Palais Stoclet]]. One common theme of both symbolist and Art Nouveau painters of the period was the stylized depiction of women. One popular subject was the American dancer [[Loie Fuller]], portrayed by French and Austrian painters and poster artists.&lt;ref&gt;Bouillon, Jean-Paul, ''Journal de l'Art Nouveau (1870-1914)'', Skira, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Glass art]] was a medium in which Art Nouveau found new and varied ways of expression. Intense amount of experimentation went on, particularly in France, to find new effects of transparency and opacity: in engraving win cameo, double layers, and acid engraving, a technique which permitted production in series. The city of [[Nancy, France|Nancy]] became an important center for the French glass industry, and the workshops of [[Emile Gallé]] and the [[Daum (studio)|Daum]] studio, led by [[Auguste Daum|Auguste]] and Antonin Daum, were located there. They worked with many notable designers, including [[Ernest Bussière]], [[Henri Bergé]], and [[Amalric Walter]]. They developed a new method of incrusting glass by pressing fragments of different color glass into the unfinished piece. They often collaborated with the furniture designer [[Louis Majorelle]], whose home and workshops were in Nancy. Another feature of Art Nouveau was the use of stained glass windows with that style of floral themes in residential salons, particularly in the Art Nouveau houses in Nancy. Many were the work of Jacques Gruber, who made windows for the [[Villa Majorelle]] and other houses.{{Sfn|Riley|2007|page=318}}

In Belgium, the leading firm was the glass factory of [[Val Saint Lambert]], which created vases in organic and floral forms, many of them designed by [[Philippe Wolfers]]. Wolfers was noted particularly for creating works of [[symbolist]] glass, often with metal decoration attached. In [[Bohemia]], then a region of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]] noted for crystal manufacture, the companies [[Lobmeyr]] and [[Loetz-Witwe]] also experimented with new coloring techniques, producing more vivid and richer colors. In Germany, experimentation was led by Karl Köpping, who used blown glass to create extremely delicate glasses in the form of flowers; so delicate that few survive today.{{Sfn|Riley|2007|page=320}}

In Vienna, the glass designs of the Secession movement were much more geometrical than those of France or Belgium; [[Otto Prutscher]] was the most rigorous glass designer of the movement.{{Sfn|Riley|2007|page=320}}

In Britain, a number of floral stained glass designs were created by [[Margaret Macdonald Mackintosh]] for the architectural display called "The House of an Art Lover."

In the United States, [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]] and his designers became particularly famous for their lamps, whose glass shades used common floral themes intricately pieced together. Tiffany lamps gained popularity after the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in Chicago in 1893, where Tiffany displayed his lamps in a Byzantine-like chapel. Tiffany experimented extensively with the processes of coloring glass, patenting in 1894 the process [[Favrile glass]], which used metallic oxides to color the interior of the molten glass, giving it an iridescent effect. His workshops produced several different series of the [[Tiffany lamp]] in different floral designs, along with stained glass windows, screens, vases and a range of decorative objects. His works were first imported to Germany, then to France by [[Siegfried Bing]], and then became one of the decorative sensations of the 1900 Exposition. An American rival to Tiffany, [[Steuben Glass]], was founded in 1903 in [[Corning (city), New York|Corning, NY]], by [[Frederick Carder]], who, like Tiffany, used the Fevrile process to create surfaces with iridescent colors. Another notable American glass artist was [[John La Farge]], who created intricate and colorful stained glass windows on both religious and purely decorative themes.{{Sfn|Riley|2007|page=320}}

The 19th-century architectural theorist [[Viollet-le-Duc]] had advocated showing, rather than concealing the iron frameworks of modern buildings, but Art Nouveau architects [[Victor Horta]] and [[Hector Guimard]] went a step further: they added iron decoration in curves inspired by floral and vegetal forms both in the interiors and exteriors of their buildings. They took the form of stairway railings in the interior, light fixtures, and other details in the interior, and balconies and other ornaments on the exterior. These became some of the most distinctive features of Art Nouveau architecture. The use of metal decoration in vegetal forms soon also appeared in silverware, lamps, and other decorative items.{{Sfn|Riley|2007|page=322}}

In the United States, the designer [[George Grant Elmslie]] made extremely intricate cast iron designs for the balustrades and other interior decoration of the buildings of Chicago architect [[Louis Sullivan]].

While French and American designers used floral and vegetal forms, [[Joseph Maria Olbrich]] and the other Secession artists designed teapots and other metal objects in a more geometric and sober style.{{Sfn|Riley|2007|page=324}}

Art Nouveau is characterized done by soft, curved shapes and lines, and usually features natural designs such as flowers, birds and other animals. The female body is a popular theme and is featured on a variety of jewelry pieces, especially cameos. It frequently included long necklaces made of pearls or sterling-silver chains punctuated by glass beads or ending in a silver or gold pendant, itself often designed as an ornament to hold a single, faceted jewel of [[amethyst]], [[peridot]], or [[citrine quartz|citrine]].&lt;ref name="Art Nouveau Jewelry"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collectorsweekly.com/fine-jewelry/art-nouveau|title=Art Nouveau Jewelry|accessdate=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Art Nouveau period brought a notable stylistic revolution to the jewelry industry, led largely by the major firms in Paris. For the previous two centuries, the emphasis in fine jewelry had been creating dramatic settings for diamonds. During the reign of Art Nouveau, diamonds usually played a supporting role. Jewelers experimented with a wide variety of other stones, including [[agate]], [[garnet]] [[opal]], [[moonstone (gemstone)|moonstone]], [[Beryl#Aquamarine and maxixe|aquamarine]] and other semi-precious stones, and with a wide variety of new techniques, among others [[vitreous enamel|enameling]], and new materials, including [[horn (anatomy)|horn]], molded glass, and [[ivory]].

Early notable Paris jewelers in the Art Nouveau style included [[Louis Aucoc]], whose family jewelry firm dated to 1821. The most famous designer of the Art Nouveau period, [[René Lalique]], served his apprenticeship in the Aucoc studio from 1874 to 1876. Lalique became a central figure of Art Nouveau jewelry and glass, using nature, from [[dragonfly|dragonflies]] to grasses, as his model. Artists from outside of the traditional world of jewellery, such as [[Paul Follot]], best known as a furniture designer, experimented with jewellery designs. Other notable French Art Nouveau jewellery designers included [[Jules Brateau]] and Georges Henry. In the United States, the most famous designer was [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]], whose work was shown at the shop of [[Siegfried Bing]] and also at the 1900 Paris Exposition.

In Britain, the most prominent figure was the Liberty &amp; Co. designer [[Archibald Knox (designer)|Archibald Knox]], who made a variety of Art Nouveau pieces, including silver belt buckles. [[C. R. Ashbee]] designed pendants in the shapes of peacocks. The versatile [[Glasgow]] designer [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]] also made jewellery, using traditional Celtic symbols. In Germany, the center for ''Jugendstil'' jewelry was the city of [[Pforzheim]], where most of the German firms, including [[Theodor Fahrner]], were located. They quickly produced works to meet the demand for the new style.

Art Nouveau architecture was a reaction against the eclectic styles which dominated European architecture in the second half of the 19th century. It was expressed through decoration. The buildings were covered with ornament in curving forms, based on flowers, plants or animals: butterflies, peacocks, swans, irises, cyclamens, orchids and water lilies. Façades were asymmetrical, and often decorated with polychrome ceramic tiles. The decoration usually suggested movement; there was no distinction between the structure and the ornament.&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé, ''Les styles de l'architecture et du mobilier'' (2006), pp. 107-111&lt;/ref&gt;

The style first appeared in Brussels' [[Hôtel Tassel]] (1894) and [[Hôtel Solvay]] (1900) of [[Victor Horta]]. The Hôtel Tassel was visited by [[Hector Guimard]], who used the same style in his first major work, the [[Castel Béranger]] (1897–98). In all of these houses, the architects also designed the furniture and the interior decoration, down to the doorknobs and carpeting. In 1899, based on the fame of the Castel Béranger, Guimard received a commission to design the entrances of the stations of the new [[Paris Métro]], which opened in 1900. Though few of the originals survived, These became the symbol of the Art Nouveau movement in Paris.

In Paris, the architectural style was also a reaction to the strict regulations imposed on building facades by [[Georges-Eugène Haussmann]], the prefect of Paris under [[Napoleon III]]. [[Bow window]]s were finally allowed in 1903, and Art Nouveau architects went to the opposite extreme, most notably in the houses of [[Jules Lavirotte]], which were essentially large works of sculpture, completely covered with decoration. An important neighborhood of Art Nouveau houses appeared in the French city of [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], around the [[Villa Majorelle]] (1901–02), the residence of furniture designer [[Louis Majorelle]]. It was designed by [[Henri Sauvage]] as a showcase for Majorelle's furniture designs.&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé, (2006), pp. 107-111&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Furniture design in the Art Nouveau period was closely associated with the architecture of the buildings;  the architects often designed the furniture, carpets, light fixtures, doorknobs, and other decorative details. The furniture was often complex and expensive; a fine finish, usually polished or varnished, was regarded as essential, and continental designs were usually very complex, with curving shapes that were expensive to make. It also had the drawback that the owner of the home could not change the furniture or add pieces in a different style without disrupting the entire effect of the room. For this reason, when Art Nouveau architecture went out of style, the style of furniture also largely disappeared.

In France, the center for furniture design and manufacture was in [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], where two major designers, [[Émile Gallé]] and [[Louis Majorelle]] had their studios and workshops, and where the ''Alliance des industries d'art'' (later called the School of Nancy) had been founded in 1901. Both designers based on their structure and ornamentation on forms taken from nature, including flowers and insects, such as the dragonfly, a popular motif in Art Nouveau design. Gallé was particularly known for his use of [[marquetry]] in relief, in the form of landscapes or poetic themes. Majorelle was known for his use of exotic and expensive woods, and for attaching bronze sculpted in vegetal themes to his pieces of furniture. Both designers used machines for the first phases of manufacture, but all the pieces were finished by hand. Other notable furniture designers of the Nancy School included [[Eugène Vallin]] and [[Émile André]]; both were architects by training, and both designed furniture that resembled the furniture from Belgian designers such as Horta and Van de Velde, which had less decoration and followed more closely the curving plants and flowers. Other notable French designers included [[Henri Bellery-Desfontaines]], who took his inspiration from the neo-Gothic styles of [[Eugène Viollet-le-Duc|Viollet-le-Duc]]; and [[Georges de Feure]], [[Eugène Gaillard]], and Édouard Colonna, who worked together with art dealer [[Siegfried Bing]] to revitalize the French furniture industry with new themes. Their work was known for "abstract naturalism", its unity of straight and curved lines, and its [[rococo]] influence. The furniture of de Feure at the Bing pavilion won a gold medal at the 1900 Paris Exposition. The most unusual and picturesque French designer was [[François-Rupert Carabin]], a sculptor by training, whose furniture featured sculpted nude female forms and symbolic animals, particularly cats, who combined Art Nouveau elements with [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]]. Other influential Paris furniture designers were [[Charles Plumet]], and [[Alexandre Charpentier]].{{sfn|Riley|2007|page=302}}  In many ways the old vocabulary and techniques of classic French 18th-century [[Rococo]] furniture were re-interpreted in a new style.&lt;ref name="Gontar, Cybele 2006" /&gt;

In Belgium, the pioneer architects of the ''Art Nouveau movement'', [[Victor Horta]] and [[Henry van de Velde]], designed furniture for their houses, using vigorous curving lines and a minimum of decoration.  The Belgian designer [[Gustave Serrurier-Bovy]] added more decoration, applying brass strips in curving forms. In the Netherlands, where the style was called ''Nieuwe Kunst'' or New Art, H.P. Berlag, Lion Cachet and Theodor Nieuwenhuis followed a different course, that of the English [[Arts and Crafts]] movement, with more geometric rational forms.

In Britain, the furniture of [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]] was purely Arts and Crafts, austere and geometrical, with long straight lines and right angles and a minimum of decoration.&lt;ref name="Lucie-Smith, 160"&gt;Lucie-Smith, 160&lt;/ref&gt; Continental designs were much more elaborate, often using curved shapes both in the basic shapes of the piece, and in applied decorative motifs. In Germany, the furniture of [[Peter Behrens]] and the [[Jugendstil]] was largely rationalist, with geometric straight lines and some decoration attached to the surface. Their goal was exactly the opposite of French Art Nouveau; simplicity of structure and simplicity of materials, for furniture that could be inexpensive and easily mass-manufactured. The same was true for the furniture of designers of the [[Wiener Werkstätte]] in Vienna, led by [[Otto Wagner]], [[Josef Hoffmann]], Josef Maria Olbrich and [[Koloman Moser]]. The furniture was geometric and had a minimum of decoration, though in style it often followed national historic precedent, particularly the [[Biedemeier]] style.{{Sfn|RIley|2007|page=308}}
 
Italian and Spanish furniture design went off in their own direction. [[Carlo Bugatti]] in Italy designed the extraordinary Snail Chair, wood covered with painted parchment and copper, for the Turin International Exposition of 1902. In Spain, following the lead of [[Antoni Gaudi]] and the ''Modernismo'' movement, the furniture designer Gaspar Homar designed works that were inspired by natural forms with touches of Catalan historic styles.{{Sfn|Riley|2007|page=312}}

In the United States, furniture design was more often inspired by the Arts and Crafts movement, or by historic American models, than by the Art Nouveau. One designer who did introduce Art Nouveau themes was [[Charles Rohlfs]] in Buffalo, New York, whose designs for American white oak furniture were influenced by motifs of [[Celtic Art]] and [[Gothic art]], with touches of Art Nouveau in the metal trim applied to the pieces.{{Sfn|Riley|2007|page=312}}

The last part of the 19th century saw many technological innovation in the manufacture of ceramics, particularly the development of high temperature (''grand feu'') porcelain with crystallised and matte glazes. At the same time, several lost techniques, such as oxblood glaze, were rediscovered. Art Nouveau ceramics were also influenced by traditional and modern Japanese and Chinese ceramics, whose vegetal and floral motifs fitted well with the Art Nouveau style. In France, artists also rediscovered the traditional [[Stoneware|''grés'']] methods and reinvented them with new motifs. Ceramics also found an important new use in architecture: Art Nouveau architects, [[Jules Lavirotte]] and [[Hector Guimard]] among them, began to decorate the façades of buildings with ceramic tiles, many of them made by the firm of [[Alexandre Bigot]], giving them a distinct Art Nouveau sculptural look. In the Art Nouveau ceramics quickly moved into the domain of sculpture and architecture.{{Sfn|Riley|2007|pages=314-15}}

One of the pioneer French Art Nouveau ceramists was [[Ernest Chaplet]], whose career in ceramics spanned thirty years. He began producing stoneware influenced by Japanese and Chinese prototypes. Beginning in 1886, he worked with painter [[Paul Gauguin]] on stoneware designs with applied figures, multiple handles, painted and partially glazed, and collaborated with sculptors [[Félix Bracquemond]], [[Jules Dalou]] and [[Auguste Rodin]]. His works were acclaimed at the 1900 Exposition.

The major national ceramics firms had an important place at the 1900 Paris Exposition: the [[Manufacture nationale de Sèvres]] outside Paris; [[Nymphenburg]], [[Meissen]], [[Villeroy &amp; Boch]] in Germany, and [[Doulton Industrial Products|Doulton]] in Britain. Other leading French ceramists included [[Taxile Doat]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Pierre-Adrien Dalpayrat|fr}}, [[Edmond Lachenal]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Albert Dammouse|fr}} and [[Auguste Delaherche]].&lt;ref&gt;''Edmond Lachenal and His Legacy'', by Martin Eidelberg, Claire Cass, Hudson Hills Press; illustrated edition (25 February 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, Art Nouveau ceramics sometimes crossed the line into sculpture. The porcelain figurine ''Dancer with a Scarf'' by [[Agathon Léonard]], made for the [[Manufacture nationale de Sèvres]], won recognition in both categories at the 1900 Paris Exposition.

The [[Zsolnay|Zsolnay factory]] in [[Pécs]], [[Hungary]], was led by [[Miklós Zsolnay]] (1800–1880) and his son, [[Vilmos Zsolnay]] (1828–1900,) with [[Tádé Sikorski]] (1852–1940) chief designer, to produce stoneware and other ceramics in 1853. In 1893, Zsolnay introduced porcelain pieces made of [[eosin]]. He led the factory to worldwide recognition by demonstrating its innovative products at world fairs and international exhibitions, including the [[Weltausstellung 1873 Wien|1873 World Fair in Vienna]], then at the [[Exposition Universelle (1878)|1878 World Fair in Paris]], where Zsolnay received a ''Grand Prix''. Frost-resisting Zsolnay building decorations were used in numerous buildings, specifically during the Art Nouveau movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.magyarkeramia.hu/keramia/zsolnay/page_en.html Timeline], accessed 1/23/08&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Textiles and wallpapers were an important vehicle of Art Nouveau from the beginning of the style, and an essential element of Art Nouveau interior design. In Britain, the textile designs o[[William Morris]] had helped launch the [[Arts and Crafts Movement]] and then Art Nouveau. Many designs were created for the [[Liberty (department store)|Liberty department store]] in London, which popularized the style throughout Europe. One such designer was the [[Silver Studio]], which provided colorful stylized floral patterns. Other distinctive designs came from [[Glasgow School]], and [[Margaret Macdonald Mackintosh]]. The Glasgow school introduced several distinctive motifs, including stylized eggs, geometric forms and the "Rose of Glasgow".

In France, a major contribution was made by designer [[Eugène Grasset]] who in 1896 published ''La Plante et ses applications ornamentales'', suggesting Art Nouveau designs based on different flowers and plants. Many patterns were designed for and produced by for the major French textile manufacturers in Mulhouse, Lille and Lyon, by German and Belgian workshops. The German designer [[Hermann Obrist]]  specialized in floral patterns, particularly the cyclamen and the "whiplash" style based on flower stems, which became a major motif of the style. The Belgian [[Henry van de Velde]] presented a textile work, ''La Veillée d'Anges'', at the Salon ''La Libre Esthéthique'' in Brussels, inspired by the symbolism of [[Paul Gauguin]] and of the [[Nabis]]. In the Netherlands, textiles were often inspired by [[batik]] patterns from the Dutch colonies in the [[East Indies]]. Folk art also inspired the creation of tapestries, carpets, embroidery and textiles in Central Europe and Scandinavia, in the work of [[Gerhard Munthe]] and [[Frida Hansen]] in Norway. The ''Five Swans'' design of [[Otto Eckmann]] appeared in more than one hundred different versions. The Hungarian designer [[János Vaszary]] combined Art Nouveau elements with folkloric themes.{{Sfn|Riley|2007|page=328}}

'''''Art and Illusion, A Study in the Psychology of Pictorial Representation''''', is a 1960 book of [[art theory]] and [[art history|history]] by [[Ernst Gombrich]], derived from the 1956 [[Bollingen Foundation#Number 35: The A. W. Mellon Lectures in the Fine Arts|A. W. Mellon Lectures in the Fine Arts]]. The book had a wide impact in art history,&lt;ref&gt;Shone, Richard and Stonard, John-Paul, eds. ''The Books That Shaped Art History: From Gombrich and Greenberg to Alpers and Krauss'', chapter 9. London: Thames &amp; Hudson, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; but also in history (e.g. [[Carlo Ginzburg]], who called it "splendid"&lt;ref&gt;Ginzburg, Carlo. "From Aby Warburg to E.H. Gombrich." In Clues, Myths, and the Historical Method, 47. Baltimore: JHU Press, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;), [[aesthetics]] (e.g. [[Nelson Goodman]]'s ''[[Languages of Art]]''&lt;ref&gt;N. Goodman: ''Languages of Art'', Indianapolis and Cambridge, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;), [[semiotics]] ([[Umberto Eco]]'s ''Theory of Semiotics''&lt;ref&gt;U. Eco: ''Theory of Semiotics'', Bloomington, 1976, pp.204-05.&lt;/ref&gt;), and music psychology ([[Robert Gjerdingen|Robert O. Gjerdingen]]'s schema theory of [[Galant style]] music).

In ''Art and Illusion,'' Gombrich argues for the importance of "schemata" in analyzing works of art: he claims that artists can only learn to represent the external world by learning from previous artists, so representation is always done using stereotyped figures and methods.

'''Bandung''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɑː|n|d|ʊ|ŋ}}) is the capital of [[West Java]] province in [[Indonesia]]. According to 2015 estimate, it is the third-largest city in Indonesia after Jakarta and Surabaya with over 2.5 million inhabitants, while [[Greater Bandung]] is the country's second largest [[List of metropolitan areas in Indonesia|metropolitan area]] with over 8.5 millions inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.citypopulation.de/php/indonesia-jawa-admin.php&lt;/ref&gt; Located {{convert|768|m|abbr=off}} [[above sea level]], approximately {{convert|140|km|0|abbr=off}} southeast of [[Jakarta]], Bandung has cooler year-round temperatures than most other [[List of cities in Indonesia|Indonesian cities]]. The city lies on a [[river basin]] surrounded by [[volcano|volcanic]] mountains. This topography provides a natural defense system, which was the primary reason for the [[Dutch East Indies]] government's plan to move the colony capital from Batavia (modern-day [[Jakarta]]) to Bandung.

The Dutch colonials first established tea [[plantation]]s around the mountains in the eighteenth century, and a road was constructed to connect the plantation area to the colonial capital [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] ({{convert|180|km|0|abbr=off}} to the northwest). The Dutch inhabitants of Bandung demanded the establishment of a municipality (''gemeente''), which was granted in 1906, and Bandung gradually developed into a resort city for plantation owners. Luxurious hotels, restaurants, cafés, and European boutiques were opened, hence the city was nicknamed ''Parijs van Java'' ({{lang-nl|"The Paris of Java"}}).

After [[Indonesian Declaration of Independence|Indonesia declared independence]] in 1945, the city experienced rapid development and urbanization, transforming Bandung from an idyllic town into a dense 16,500 people/km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (per square kilometer) metropolitan area, a living space for over 8.5 million people. New [[skyscraper]]s, high-rise buildings, bridges, and gardens have been constructed. [[Natural resource]]s have been heavily exploited, particularly by conversion of protected upland area into highland villas and real estate. Also, although the city has encountered many problems (ranging from waste disposal and floods to a complicated traffic system resulting from a lack of road infrastructure), Bandung still attracts large numbers of tourists, weekend sightseers, and migrants from other parts of Indonesia. The city has won a regional environmental sustainability award for having the cleanest air among other major cities in [[ASEAN]] countries in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://jakartaglobe.id/news/bandung-wins-cleanest-air-award-asean/|title=Bandung Wins Cleanest Air Award From Asean|newspaper=Jakarta Globe|accessdate=13 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city has also become known as a [[Smart City]], leveraging technology to improve government services, including social media, that alert the authorities to issues such as floods or traffic jams &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chandran|first1=Nyshka|title=Architect-turned-mayor transforms his hometown into Indonesia's least bureaucratic city|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/13/indonesian-city-of-bandung-capitalizes-on-smart-technology-under-mayor-ridwan-kamil.html|accessdate=24 January 2018|publisher=CNBC|date=13 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Valentina|first1=Jessicha|title=Bandung is Indonesia's leading smart city: Eco-architect|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/life/2017/03/02/bandung-is-indonesias-leading-smart-city-eco-architect.html|accessdate=24 January 2018|publisher=The Jakarta Post|date=March 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first [[Asian-African Conference]], also known as the ''Bandung Conference'' was hosted in Bandung by President [[Soekarno|Sukarno]] in 1955. Redevelopment of the international airport was completed in 2016. To improve infrastructure, the construction of a Jakarta-Bandung [[High-speed rail|High Speed Rail]] and Bandung Metro Kapsul, a type of indigenous [[people mover|Automated People Mover]] (APM) will begin in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://berita.suaramerdeka.com/bandung-segera-miliki-metro-kapsul/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=3 February 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170204004502/http://berita.suaramerdeka.com/bandung-segera-miliki-metro-kapsul/ |archive-date=4 February 2017 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new Bandung [[Kertajati International Airport]] opened in June 2018 with a 2,500 meter long runway and only one flight per day to [[Surabaya]].

The Bandung Basin is an important source of water for potable water, irrigation, and fisheries, with its {{convert|6,147|e6m3|abbr=unit}} of groundwater being a major reservoir for the city.&lt;ref name="iges"/&gt;
The northern section of Bandung is hillier than other parts of the city, and the distinguished truncated flat-peak shape of the [[Mount Tangkuban Perahu|Tangkuban Perahu]] volcano (''Tangkuban Perahu'' literally means 'upside-down boat') can be seen from the city to the north. Long-term volcanic activity has created fertile [[andisols|andisol]] soil in the north, suitable for intensive [[rice]], [[fruit]], [[tea]], [[tobacco]], and [[coffee]] plantations. In the [[south]] and [[east]], [[alluvial]] soils deposited by the Cikapundung river predominate.

The official name of the city during the colonial Dutch East Indies period was '''Bandoeng'''.

The earliest reference to the area dates back to 1488, although archaeological findings suggest a type of ''[[Homo erectus]]'' species had long previously lived on the banks of the Cikapundung River and around the old lake of Bandung.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=B.

In 1786, a supply road connecting Batavia (now [[Jakarta]]), [[Bogor]], [[Cianjur]], Bandung, [[Sumedang]] and [[Cirebon]] was constructed. In 1809, [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]], French Emperor and conqueror of much of Europe including the [[Netherlands]] and its colonies, ordered the Dutch Indies Governor [[Daendels|H.W. Daendels]] to improve the defensive systems of [[Java island|Java]] to protect against the British in India. Daendels built a road, stretching approximately {{convert|1,000|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the west to the east coast of Java, passing through Bandung.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pramoedya sheds light on dark side of Daendels highway|publisher=The Jakarta Post|date=8 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Peter .J.M Nas |author2=Pratiwo |year=2001|publisher=University of Leiden|url=http://www.leidenuniv.nl/fsw/nas/pdf/NasPratiwoPostweg30-10-2001.pdf|format=PDF|title=Java and De Groote Postweg, La Grande Route, The High Military Road|accessdate=22 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1810, the road was laid down in Bandung and was named ''De Groote Postweg'' (or the '[[Great Post Road]]'), the present-day location of Asia-Afrika Street. Under Daendels' orders, R. A. Wiranatakusumah II, the Chief Administrator of the Bandung regency at that time, moved office from Krapyak, in the south, to a place near a pair of holy city wells (''sumur Bandung''), the present-day site of the city square (''alun-alun''). He built his ''dalem'' (palace), ''masjid agung'' (the grand mosque) and ''pendopo'' (public-official meeting place) in the classical Sundanese orientation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Wajah Bandung Tempoe Doeloe|author=Kunto, Haryanto|year=1984|publisher=Granesia}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the pendopo facing [[Tangkuban Perahu]] mountain, which was believed to have a mystical ambience.

[[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]] flocked into the city to help run facilities, services and as vendors. The area adjacent to the train station is still recognisable as the old Chinatown district. In 1906, Bandung was given the status of ''gemeente'' (municipality) and then twenty years later ''stadsgemeente'' (city municipality).

Beginning of time the early 1920s, the Dutch East Indies government made plans to move their capital from Batavia to Bandung. Accordingly, during this decade, the Dutch colonial government commenced construction of military barracks, the central government building (''Gouvernments Bedrijven'', the present-day [[Gedung Sate]]) and other government buildings. However, this plan, was cut short by [[World War II]], after which the Dutch were not able to re-establish their colony due to the Indonesian Declaration of Independence.

The fertile area of the Parahyangan Mountains surrounding Bandung supports productive [[tea]] plantations. In the nineteenth century, [[Franz Wilhelm Junghuhn|Franz Junghuhn]] introduced the [[cinchona]] (''kina'') plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=If Only Junghuhn Knows How Cinchona in Indonesia Becomes... |publisher=Pikiran Rakyat |language=Indonesian |url=http://www.pikiran-rakyat.com/cetak/0604/07/0108.htm |date=7 June 2004 |accessdate=21 August 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060517024534/http://www.pikiran-rakyat.com/cetak/0604/07/0108.htm |archivedate=17 May 2006 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; With its cooler elevated landscape, surrounded by major plantations, Bandung became an exclusive European resort area.&lt;ref name=brief&gt;{{cite web  | title = An Extremely Brief Urban History of Bandung | publisher = Institute of Indonesian Architectural Historian | url=http://www.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~fujimori/lsai/bandung.html| accessdate = 20 August 2006 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060716093926/http://www.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~fujimori/lsai/bandung.html| archivedate= 16 July 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rich plantation owners visited the city on weekends, attracting ladies and business people from the capital, Batavia. [[Braga Street]] grew into a promenade street with cafés, restaurants and boutique shops. Two [[art-deco]] style hotels, Savoy Homann and Preanger, were built in the vicinity of the Concordia Society, a clubhouse for the wealthy with a large ballroom and a theatre.&lt;ref name=creative/&gt;

After [[Indonesian Declaration of Independence|Indonesian Independence]] in 1945, Bandung was designated the capital of [[West Java]] [[province]]. During the [[Indonesian National Revolution|1945-1949 independence struggle]] against the [[Netherlands]] seeking to retake its colonies in the "Dutch East Indies", some of the heaviest battles occurred in and around Bandung. At the end of World War II Dutch troops were virtually absent in Java. To assist the restoration of Dutch sovereignty, the [[United Kingdom|British]] took a military hold on Java's major cities, and the British military commander set an ultimatum for the Indonesian combatants in Bandung to leave the city. In response, on 24 March 1946, much of the southern part of Bandung was deliberately set alight as the combatants left; an event known as ''Bandung Lautan Api'' or the 'Bandung Sea of Fire'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.bandungheritage.org/images/stories/dokumen/bandung_sea_of_fire.pdf |format=PDF |title=Social History of Bandung Lautan Api (Bandung Sea of Fire) 24 March 1946 |author=Sitaresmi, Ratnayu |accessdate=22 August 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170603233047/http://www.bandungheritage.org/images/stories/dokumen/bandung_sea_of_fire.pdf |archivedate=3 June 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955, the first Asian-African Conference - also known as the ''[[Bandung Conference]]'' - was hosted in Bandung by President [[Soekarno]], and attended by the heads of states representing twenty-nine independent countries from Asia and Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Jamie Mackie, 'Bandung 1955: Non-Alignment and Afro-Asian Solidarity', [[Singapore]], Editions Didier Millet, {{ISBN|981-4155-49-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conference venue was at the [[Gedung Merdeka]], the former Concordia Society building. The conference announced 10 points of declaration for the promotion of [[world peace]] promotion and for opposition against [[colonialism]], and is known as the [[Bandung Conference#Declaration|Declaration of Bandung]]. This was followed by a wave of nationalism and [[decolonization]] movements around the globe which remapped world politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cold War II: The Eisenhower Administration, the Bandung Conference, and the Reperiodization of the Postwar Era| author=Jason Parker| journal=Diplomatic History| volume=30| issue=5| year=2006| pages=867–892| doi=10.1111/j.1467-7709.2006.00582.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conference was also the first international conference of people of color in the history of mankind.&lt;ref name="wright"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Color Curtain: A Report on the Bandung Conference| author=Richard Wright| authorlink=Richard Wright (author)| publisher=University Press of Mississippi |year=1995|isbn=0-87805-748-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]] in his book, ''[[The Color Curtain]]'', claims that there was epic meaning of the conference for people of color around the world.&lt;ref name="wright"/&gt;

In 1987, the city boundary was expanded by the 'Greater Bandung' (''Bandung Raya'') plan; with a relocation of higher concentration development zones outside the city in an attempt to dilute population density in the old city. During this development, the [[city centre|city core]] was often uprooted, with old buildings torn down, lot sizes regrouped and rezoned, changing idyllic residential areas to commercial zones with bustling chain supermarkets, malls, banks and upscale developments.&lt;ref name=brief/&gt;

In 2005, an Asian-African Conference was partly held in Bandung, attended by world leaders such as Indonesian President Susilo B. Yudhoyono, President of [[China]] Hu Jintao, Prime Minister of [[India]] Manmohan Singh, President of [[South Africa]] Thabo Mbeki, President of [[Nigeria]] Obasanjo, and other luminaries.&lt;ref name="Discover Bandung"&gt;[http://discoverbandung.chasecareer.net Discover Bandung] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130307003733/http://discoverbandung.chasecareer.net/ |date=7 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Climate ==
Bandung experiences [[tropical monsoon climate]] (''Am'') according to [[Köppen climate classification]] as the driest month precipitation total is below {{convert|60|mm}}, bordering with [[subtropical highland climate]] (''Cfb''). The wettest month is February with precipitation total {{convert|255.0|mm}}, while the driest month is September with precipitation total {{convert|50.0|mm}}. The average temperature throughout the year tends to be cooler than most cities in Indonesia due to the altitude influence. The average temperature throughout the year only has little variation due to its location near the equator.

===Old buildings and structures===
Bandung is home to numerous examples of Dutch colonial architecture; most notably the tropical Art Deco, dubbed [[New Indies Style]]. [[Henri Maclaine Pont]] was among the first Dutch architects to recognise the importance of combining each architectural style with local cultural traditions. He stressed that [[modern architecture]] should interact with [[local history]] and native elements.&lt;ref name="ww"&gt;{{cite conference|author1=W. Wangsadinata |author2=T.K.

In the same year, another Dutch architect J Gerber designed ''Gouverments Bedrijven'' (Government Companies) in line with the colonial government plan to move the capital from Batavia to Bandung. The building is an example of a harmonious mixture between West and East architectural styles, particularly the [[Italian Renaissance]] style of [[arch]] structures in the wings and [[pendopo]]-like structures commonly found in Java in the middle section. The building is known as [[Gedung Sate]], named after the distinguished small [[satay]]-shaped structure on the roof, and is today used as the head office of the [[West Java]] provincial government and House of Representatives.

The architectural blending of modern and native traditional was followed by several Dutch architects who shaped the city landmarks. In the 1930s, Bandung became known as an architectural laboratory due to the many Dutch architects who experimented with new architectural designs. [[Albert Aalbers]] added the [[streamline moderne]] style to the Art Deco by designing the DENIS bank (1936) and renovated the Savoy Homann Hotel (1939). [[Wolff Schoemaker|C.P.W. Schoemaker]] was one of architects who strongly added native elements in his artworks, including the [[Villa Isola]] (1932), Hotel Preanger (1929), the regional military headquarter (1918), [[Gedung Merdeka]] (1921) and ITB Rectorate Building (1925).&lt;ref name="ww"/&gt;

=== Modern high-rise buildings===
Though Bandung is known for its large number of old Dutch architecture buildings, the city is going through high rise building boom recently. At present there are more than 100 high rise building in the city and many more under construction or planned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.emporis.com/city/100261/bandung-indonesia/type/3/1|title=High-rise buildings in Bandung}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transportation==

===Road===

Bandung can be accessed by highways from Jakarta. An intercity toll highway called [[Cipularang Toll Road]], connecting [[Jakarta]], [[Karawang]], [[Purwakarta]], Padalarang and Bandung, was completed in May 2005 and is the fastest way to reach Bandung from the capital by road. Driving time is about 1.5 hours on average. There are three other options: the Puncak route (Jakarta-[[Cianjur]]/[[Sukabumi]]-Bandung), Purwakarta route (Jakarta-Cikampek-Purwakarta-Cikalong Wetan-Padalarang-Cimahi-Bandung) and the Subang route (Jakarta-[[Cikampek]]-[[Subang, Indonesia|Subang]]-[[Lembang]]-Bandung). From cities further east ([[Cirebon]], [[Tasikmalaya]] and [[Central Java]] province), Bandung can be accessed through the main provincial road. [[Indonesian National Route 3]] links Bandung with the rest of Java towards [[Cilegon]] and Ketapang ([[Banyuwangi]]).

The [[Pasupati Bridge]]  was built to relieve traffic congestion in the city for east-west transport. The {{convert|2.8|km|1|adj=on}} [[cable-stayed bridge]] lies through the Cikapundung Valley. It is {{convert|30|to|60|m|ft|abbr=off}} wide and, after extensive delays, it was finally completed in June 2005, following financial investment from [[Kuwait]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kuwait Investasikan 1,5 Milyar Dollar AS di Indonesia|trans-title=Kuwait invested USD 1.5 billion in Indonesia|url=http://www.kompas.com/kompas-cetak/0209/14/ekonomi/kuwa14.htm|work=Kompas|language=Indonesian|date=14 October 2002|accessdate=23 August 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311083734/http://www.kompas.com/kompas-cetak/0209/14/ekonomi/kuwa14.htm|archivedate=11 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bridge is part of Bandung's comprehensive inner-city highways plan.

[[Taxicab|Taxis]] and [[mobile apps]] transport are widely available. The primary means of public transportation is by minibus, called ''[[Share taxi#Indonesia|angkot]]'' (from ''angkutan'' 'transportation' and ''kota'' 'city'). They are privately operated and cheap, serving multiple routes throughout the city, but are basic transport and not known for being comfortable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bandung.world-guides.com/bandung_travel.html Bandung Transport and Car Rental: Bandung, West Java, Indonesia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; To find exact angkot routes, information is available through the drivers or at terminals. City-owned [[bus]]es, called ''DAMRI'', operate on longer high capacity routes. Bandung has 2 intercity bus terminals: Leuwipanjang, serving buses from the west, and Cicaheum, serving buses from the east. Both are at full capacity and are to be replaced by a new terminal at Gedebage on {{convert|15|ha}} land, after which the old terminals will function as inner city terminals. The new terminal will be located next to the Gedebage railway station near of Gedebage container dry port.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pikiran-rakyat.com/node/147232|title=Bappeda Targetkan Studi Kelaikan Terminal Gedebage Selesai Tahun Ini|work=Pikiran Rakyat|date=2 June 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324152413/http://www.pikiran-rakyat.com/node/147232|archivedate=24 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2012|04}}, a cable car project 'Bandung Skybridge' to connect Pasteur (Cihampelas) to Sabuga (Taman Sari) was said to be 90 percent complete and awaiting legal authorization to operate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.pikiran-rakyat.com/node/185342 |title="Bandung Skybridge" akan Direalisasikan |work=Pikiran Rakyat |date=20 April 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422041745/http://www.pikiran-rakyat.com/node/185342 |archivedate=22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, {{As of|2016|lc=y}}, the project has still to be realised. To ease Cihampelas traffic congestion, a skywalk for pedestrians only from Cihampelas to Tamansari was built with budget of Rp45 billion. The skywalk, named Teras Cihampelas, was inaugurated by the mayor of Bandung, Ridwan Kamil, on 4 February 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Saokani|first1=Kukuh|title=Skywalk Cihampelas Bandung Hadir untuk Manjakan Pejalan Kaki|url=http://regional.liputan6.com/read/2847254/skywalk-cihampelas-bandung-hadir-untuk-manjakan-pejalan-kaki|accessdate=18 March 2017|work=liputan6.com|date=5 February 2017|language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vehicles will be able to be parked at Tamansari.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jabar.tribunnews.com/2014/02/08/bandung-skywalk-tahap-pertama-dibangun-di-cihampelas |title=Bandung Skywalk Tahap Pertama Dibangun di Cihampelas |date=8 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bandung City has also announced an intention to build LRT (Light Rail Transit).

==Science and education==
[[File:ITB 1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Institut Teknologi Bandung]]]]
There are hundreds of public and private schools in Bandung and several state-funded and administered Junior High Schools (SMP Negeri) and State High Schools (SMA Negeri). At least sixteen universities—three of which are state-owned—and 45 [[professional schools]] are scattered across the city. Education from social sciences and technology to tourism education can be found at one of those universities.

===Colleges and universities===
Among the universities located in Bandung are: [[Institut Teknologi Bandung]] (Bandung Institute of Technology), [[Universitas Padjadjaran]] (Padjadjaran University), [[Parahyangan Catholic University]], [[Universitas Islam Bandung]], (Bandung Islamic University), [[Maranatha Christian University|Universitas Kristen Maranatha]] (Maranatha Christian University), [[Universitas Islam Nusantara]] (Nusantara Islamic University), [[Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia]] (Indonesia University of Education), [[Universitas Islam Negeri Sunan Gunung Djati]] (Sunan Gunung Djati Islamic State University), [[Universitas Pasundan]] (Pasundan University), [[Institut Teknologi Telkom]] (Telkom Institute of Technology), [[Politeknik Negeri Bandung]] (Bandung State Polytechnic), and [[Sekolah Tinggi Pariwisata Bandung]] (Bandung Institute of Tourism), all being considered among the best universities in their respective fields of specialty in Indonesia.

Retrieved on 12 March 2016. p. 35/51.&lt;/ref&gt; (defunct)

===Observatories===
In the north of Bandung, [[Bosscha Observatory]] is the only [[observatory]] in Indonesia. Construction of the observatory began in 1923 and was completed in 1928. In 1922, the first international publication from Bosscha Observatory was published and in 1959, the observatory was absorbed as a part of the Department of [[Astronomy]] at Institut Teknologi Bandung (The Bandung Institute of Technology).

==Economy==

The Bandung economy is mainly built upon tourism, business, creative industry, high-tech and manufacturing industries, educational institutions, technology, retail services, financial services, pharmaceutical companies, and food production.&lt;ref name="Discover Bandung"/&gt;

Bandung has nearly 50 higher educational institutions and is among the most popular destination for education in Indonesia.  The once quiet residential district of Dago has become an important business and entertainment centre with chic cafés and restaurants spread out along Dago Street. In the early 1990s Cihampelas Street became a popular clothing store location and remains so to this day.

Creative culture has shaped some of the Bandung economy. Small businesses known as "distro" sell non-[[trademark]]ed products made by local designers. Books, indie label records, magazines, fashion products, and other accessories are typical distro products. Distros are popular with young people and distance themselves from factory outlets in term of [[philosophy]]. Distros arise from individual designers and young entrepreneurs, while factory outlet products are from large-scale garment factories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=From Indie to Magic |url=http://www.kompas.com/kompas-cetak/0308/22/muda/504835.htm |language=Indonesian |publisher=Kompas |date=22 August 2003 |accessdate=21 August 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929134336/http://www.kompas.com/kompas-cetak/0308/22/muda/504835.htm |archivedate=29 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bandung city administration has agreed to substantially develop seven industrial and trade areas, for Bandung specialty products:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pikiran-rakyat.com/node/179610 |title=Tujuh Sentra Industri Jadi Ciri Bandung 2013 |date=6 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of Bandung is part of the [[Creative Cities Network|UNESCO Creative Cities Network]] which it joined in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://aseaneconomist.com/unesco-names-singapore-and-bandung-as-creative-cities-of-design/|title=Unesco names Singapore and Bandung as Creative Cities of Design - Asean Economist|last=Rivers|first=Paul|date=2015-12-13|work=Asean Economist|access-date=2018-10-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental issues==

The north of the city serves as a [[water reservoir]] for Bandung, however, the area has seen substantial residential development. Several attempts to protect this area have been made, including the creation of reserves such as the Juanda National Park and Puncrut, but development continues. Regular flooding in Bandung's south also presents a real and dangerous ongoing problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

From mid-2005, Bandung faced another environmental disaster, when the city's [[landfill]] site was reevaluated after a garbage slide in 2005 which buried a village, Kampung Gajah, beneath it, killing over a hundred people.&lt;ref&gt;SP 18 May 2006 http://www.sp18.com/2006/05/&lt;/ref&gt; The accumulation of {{convert|8,000|m3/day|abbr=on}} of domestic garbage piled up, causes severe air pollution by local burning, the spread of disease, and water contamination. The provincial government has so far failed in its attempts to solve the garbage issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Trash in Bandung Fears Uncollected|publisher=Pikiran Rakyat|language=Indonesian|url=http://www.pikiran-rakyat.com/cetak/2005/0205/23/0103.htm|date=23 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=From Bandung Ocean of Flame to the Ocean of Trash |publisher=Kompas |language=Indonesian |url=http://www.kompas.com/kompas-cetak/0503/14/teropong/1615278.htm |date=25 March 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130625071739/http://www.kompas.com/kompas-cetak/0503/14/teropong/1615278.htm |archivedate=25 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, it was awarded in 2015 as the least polluted city in the country from the forestry and environment ministry, and a further regional award in 2017 was also given from [[ASEAN]] as the cleanest air among other major cities in ASEAN countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jakartaglobe.id/news/bandung-wins-cleanest-air-award-asean/ |title=Bandung Wins Cleanest Air Award From Asean |accessdate=September 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Fascism sidebar}}
The '''''Milizia Volontaria per la Sicurezza Nazionale''''' ('''MVSN''', "Voluntary Militia for National Security"), commonly called the '''Blackshirts''' ({{lang-it|Camicie Nere}}, CCNN, singular: ''Camicia Nera'') or '''''[[Squadrismo|squadristi]]''''' (singular: ''squadrista''), was originally the [[paramilitary]] wing of the [[National Fascist Party]] and, after 1923, an all-volunteer [[militia]] of the [[Kingdom of Italy]]. Its members were distinguished by their black uniforms (modelled on those of the ''[[Arditi]]'', Italy's elite troops of World War I) and their loyalty to [[Benito Mussolini]], the ''[[Duce]]'' (leader) of [[Italian Fascism|Fascism]], to whom they swore an oath. The founders of the paramilitary groups were nationalist intellectuals, former army officers and young landowners opposing peasants' and country labourers' unions. Their methods became harsher as Mussolini's power grew, and they used violence and intimidation against Mussolini's opponents.&lt;ref name="Bosworth"&gt;Bosworth, R. J. B, ''Mussolini's Italy: Life Under the Fascist Dictatorship, 1915–1945'' (Penguin Books, 2005), p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943, following the [[Fall of the Fascist regime in Italy|fall of the Fascist regime]], the MVSN was integrated into the [[Royal Italian Army]] and disbanded.

==History==
The Blackshirts were established as the ''squadristi'' in 1919 and consisted of many disgruntled former soldiers. It was given the task of leading fights against their bitter enemies – the Socialists. They may have numbered 200,000 by the time of Mussolini's [[March on Rome]] from 27 to 29 October 1922. In 1922 the ''squadristi'' were reorganized into the ''milizia'' and formed numerous ''bandiere'', and on 1 February 1923 the Blackshirts became the Volunteer Militia for National Security (''Milizia Volontaria per la Sicurezza Nazionale'', or MVSN), which lasted until the 8 September 1943 [[Armistice of Cassibile]]. The [[Italian Social Republic]], located in the areas of northern Italy occupied by Germany, reformed the MVSN on 8 December 1943 into the [[National Republican Guard (Italy)|National Republican Guard]] (''Guardia Nazionale Repubblicana'', or GNR).

==Organization==
{{main|Founding of Blackshirts|Milizia Coloniale|Albanian Fascist Militia}}
Benito Mussolini was the leader, or [[Commandant|Commandant-General]] and First Honorary Corporal, of the blackshirts, but executive functions were carried out by the Chief of Staff, equivalent to an army general. The MVSN was formed in imitation of the ancient [[Roman army]], as follows:

===Basic organization===
The terms after the first are not words common to European armies (e.g., the Italian ''battaglione'' has cognates in many languages). Instead, they derive from the structure of the [[Roman army|armies of ancient Rome]].

*Zona (zone) = [[division (military)|division]]
*Legione ([[Roman legion|legion]]) = [[regiment]], each legion was a [[militia]] unit consisting of a small active cadre and a large reserve of civilian volunteers.
*Coorte ([[Cohort (military unit)|cohort]]) =  [[battalion]]
*Centuria ([[centuria]]) = [[company (military unit)|company]]
*Manipolo ([[Maniple (military unit)|maniple]]) = [[platoon]]
*Squadra ([[squad]]) = squad

These units were also organized on the triangular principle as follows:

* 3 squadre = 1 manipolo ([[Maniple (military unit)|maniple]])
* 3 manipoli = 1 centuria ([[centuria]])
* 3 centuriae = 1 coorte ([[Cohort (military unit)|cohort]])
* 3 coorti = 1 legione ([[Roman legion|legion]])
* 3 legioni = 1 divisioni (field division)
* 3 or more legioni = 1 zona (zone &amp;ndash; an administrative division)

===Territorial organization===
The [[MVSN original organization]] consisted of 15 zones controlling 133 legions (one per [[Provinces of Italy|province]]) of three cohorts each and one Independent Group controlling 10 legions. In 1929 it was reorganized into  four ''raggruppamenti'', but later in October 1936 it was reorganized into 14 zones controlling only 133 legions with two cohorts each, one of men 21 to 36 years old and the other of men up to 55 years old. There were also special units in Rome, on [[Ponza]] Island and the black uniformed ''Moschettieri del Duce'' ("The Leader's Musketeers", Mussolini's Guard), the [[Albanian Fascist Militia]] (four legions) and ''[[Milizia Coloniale]]'' in Africa (seven legions).

===Security militia===
Special militias were also organized to provide [[security police]] and [[gendarmerie]] functions, these included:

* Forestry Militia
* [[Border guard|Frontier Militia]]
* [[Highway patrol|Highway Militia]]
* Port Militia
* Posts and Telegraph Militia
* Railway Militia
* [[University Militias|University Militia]]
* Anti-aircraft and Coastal Artillery Militia, a combined command which controlled two militias:
** Anti-Aircraft Militia
** [[Coastal Artillery]] Militia

===Ethiopian Campaign===
[[File:Dire Dawa Station Blackshirts 1936.jpg|thumb|Blackshirts seize a railway station in [[Dire Dawa]].]]
During the 1935–36 [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|Abyssinian Campaign]] seven CCNN Divisions were organized:

*[[1st Blackshirt Division (23 March)|1st (23rd March) CCNN Division]]
*[[2nd Blackshirt Division (28 October)|2nd (28th October) CCNN Division]]
*[[3rd Blackshirt Division (21 April)|3rd (21st April) CCNN Division]]
*[[4th Blackshirt Division (3 January)|4th (3rd January) CCNN Division]]
*[[5th Blackshirt Division 1 Febbraio|5th (1st Febbraio) CCNN Division]]
*[[6th Blackshirt Division (Tevere)|6th (Tevere) CCNN Division]]
The first six Divisions were sent to Ethiopia and participated in the war.
*[[7th Blackshirt Division (Cirene)|7th (Cirene) CCNN Division]] – The 7th CCNN Division "Cirene" was never deployed overseas or even fully equipped before it was disbanded.&lt;ref&gt;The Blackshirt Division Order of Battle comes from "Storia delle Unità Combattenti della MVSN 1923-1943" by Ettore Lucas and Giorgio de Vecchi, Giovanni Volpe Editore 1976 pages 63 to 116 plus errata.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Spanish Civil War ==
Three CCNN Divisions were sent to participate in the [[Spanish Civil War]] as part of the [[Corpo Truppe Volontarie]]. The Blackshirt (Camicie Nere, or CCNN) Divisions contained regular soldiers and volunteer militia from the Fascist Party. The CCNN divisions were semi-motorised.
* [[1st CCNN Division "Dio lo Vuole"]] (''"God Wills it"'')
* [[2nd CCNN Division "Fiamme Nere"]] (''"Black Flames"'')
* [[3rd CCNN Division "Penne Nere"]] (''"Black Feathers"'')

The 3rd CCNN Division was disbanded and consolidated with the 2nd CCNN Division in April 1937 after their defeat at [[Battle of Guadalajara|Guadalajara]]. After the [[War in the North|campaigns in Northern Spain]] ended in October 1937, the 2nd CCNN Division was consolidated with the 1st CCNN and renamed the [[Division XXIII di Marzo|XXIII de Marzo Division "Llamas Negras"]].

==World War II==
[[File:CCNN in Russia 1.jpg|thumb|Blackshirts during Operation Barbarossa]]
In 1940 the MVSN was able to muster 340,000 first-line combat troops, providing three divisions (1st, 2nd and 4th &amp;ndash; all three of which were lost in the [[North African Campaign]]) and, later in 1942, a fourth division ("M") and fifth division ''Africa'' were forming.

Mussolini also pushed through plans to raise 142 MVSN combat battalions of 650 men each to provide a ''Gruppo di Assalto'' to each army division. These Gruppi consisted of two cohorts (each of three ''centuriae'' of three ''manipoli'' of two ''squadre'' each) plus Gruppo Supporto company of two heavy machine gun ''manipoli'' (with three HMG each) and two 81&amp;nbsp;mm mortar ''manipoli'' (with three Mortars each).

Later 41 Mobile groups were raised to become the third regiment in Italian Army divisions as it was determined through operational experience that the Italian army's binary divisions were too small in both manpower and heavy equipment. These mobile groups suffered heavy casualties due to being undermanned, under equipped and under trained. 

Late in the war Mussolini decided to create 22 highly trained combat battalions called M Battalions. These battalions were given the designation M alongside their names in the Army OOB to indicate their status; that they had received specialist assault and combat training, or had proven themselves in combat and had received a battlefield promotion to this status. By the end of the Fascist regime only 11 battalions had been fully formed.

The MVSN fought in every theater where Italy did.

==Appearance==
The Blackshirts wore the same uniform as the Italian army with the addition of a black shirt and tie and a black [[fez]]. The uniform jacket had black flames with two ends on the collar in place of the insignia and the lictor bundles instead of the army's stars &lt;ref&gt;http://www.regioesercito.it/uniformi/unimilizia35.htm&lt;/ref&gt;. There was an all-black dress uniform worn by some officers and the ''Moschettieri del Duce'' ("The Leader's Musketeers", Mussolini's Guard)

==Ranks==
''With translated material from the corresponding Italian Wikipedia article''


Mussolini as ''Comandante Generale'' was made ''Primo Caporale Onorario'' (First Honorary Corporal) in 1935 and Adolf Hitler was made ''Caporale Onorario'' (Honorary Corporal) in 1937. All other ranks closely approximated those of the old [[Roman army]] as follows.

== Legacy ==
[[File:Rothermere - Hurrah for the Blackshirts.jpg|thumb|Infamous ''[[Daily Mail]]'' article congratulating the [[British Union of Fascists]].]]

The ethos and sometimes the uniform were later copied by others who shared Mussolini's political ideas, including [[Adolf Hitler]] in [[Nazi Germany]], who issued brown shirts to the "Storm Troops" (''[[Sturmabteilung]]'') and black uniforms to the "Defense Squad" (''[[Schutzstaffel]]'', also colloquially known as "Brownshirts", because they wore black suit-like tunics with brown shirts), Sir [[Oswald Mosley]] in the [[United Kingdom]] (whose [[British Union of Fascists]] were also known as the "Blackshirts"), the [[Ratniks|Warriors for the Advancement of the Bulgarian National Spirit]] who wore red shirts,  [[William Dudley Pelley]] in the [[United States]] ([[Silver Legion of America]] or "Silver Shirts"),  in [[Mexico]] the [[Camisas Doradas]] or "Golden Shirts",  [[Plínio Salgado]] in [[Brazil]] (whose followers wore green shirts), and [[Eoin O'Duffy]] in the [[Irish Free State]] (Army Comrades Association or "[[Blueshirts]]"). "Blueshirts" can also refer to Canadian fascists belonging to the [[Canadian National Socialist Unity Party]] and to the members of [[Falange Española]], the most influential party within [[francoism|Franco's dictatorship]] in [[Spain]]. The paramilitary fascist [[Iron Guard]] members in Romania and the fascist [[Yugoslav Radical Union]] wore green shirts.

After the [[Armistice of Cassibile]] was signed, the Blackshirts were dissolved; in the pro-fascist [[Italian Social Republic]] they were replaced by the [[National Republican Guard (Italy)|National Republican Guard]] and the [[Black Brigades]] in the militia role, alongside the [[Republican Police Corps]].

{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2012}}
'''Christian deism''' is a standpoint in the [[philosophy of religion]], which branches from [[Christianity]]. It refers to a deist who believes in the moral teachings—but not divinity—of [[Jesus]]. Corbett and Corbett (1999) cite [[John Adams]] and [[Thomas Jefferson]]&lt;!--Discuss on talk page before removing!--&gt; as exemplars.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Corbett and Julia Mitchell Corbett, ''Politics and religion in the United States'' (1999) p. 68
&lt;/ref&gt; 

The earliest-found usage of the term ''Christian deism'' in print in English is in 1738 in a book by [[Thomas Morgan (deist)|Thomas Morgan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T_fP-TKe-PwC&amp;pg=PA189 | title=The moral philosopher: In a dialogue between Philalethes a Christian deist, and Theophanes a Christian Jew | first=Thomas | last=Morgan | authorlink=Thomas Morgan (deist) | year=1738}}&lt;/ref&gt; appearing about ten times by 1800.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com/search?q=%22christian+deism%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lpJ0TbX-JpHmsQPxhcTQCw&amp;ved=0CCEQpwUoBA&amp;source=lnt&amp;tbs=bks%3A1%2Ccdr%3A1%2Ccd_min%3ADec+31_2+399%2Ccd_max%3A1799-12-31&amp;tbm= |title=Googlebooks.com search for "Christian Deism" before 1800.}} In most cases it was used to name a group that the author opposed.
&lt;/ref&gt;
The term ''Christian deist'' is found as early as 1722,&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book | title=Christianity vindicated against infidelity | first=Daniel | last=Waterland | year=1722 | page=63 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m4pbAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA63 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
in ''Christianity vindicated against infidelity'' by Daniel Waterland (he calls it a misuse of language), and adopted later by [[Matthew Tindal]] in his 1730 work, ''Christianity as Old as the Creation''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Christianity as Old as the Creation | first=Matthew | last=Tindal |authorlink=Matthew Tindal | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-aIOAAAAIAAJ | year=1730 |pages=368 ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian deism is influenced by [[Christianity]], as well as both main forms of deism: classical and modern. In 1698 English writer Matthew Tindal (1653–1733) published a pamphlet "The Liberty of the Press" as a "Christian" deist.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}{{dubious|date=July 2011|reason= also vague in terms of meaning}} He believed that the state should control the Church in matters of public communication.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony C. Thiselton, ''Hermeneutics: An Introduction'' (2009) p 137&lt;/ref&gt;{{relevance inline|date=October 2012}}

It adopts the ethics and non-mystical teachings of Jesus, while denying that Jesus was a deity. Scholars of the founding fathers of the United States "have tended to place the founders' religion into one of three categories—non-Christian deism, Christian deism, and orthodox Christianity."&lt;ref&gt;The faiths of the founding fathers, by David Lynn Holmes, p. 163 (2006)
&lt;/ref&gt;
[[John Locke]] and [[John Tillotson]], especially, inspired Christian deism, through their respective writings.&lt;ref name="Williston Walker 1985"&gt;A history of the Christian church, by Williston Walker, 579 (1985)
&lt;/ref&gt;
Possibly the most famed person to hold this position was Thomas Jefferson, who praised "nature's God" in the "Declaration of Independence" (1776) and edited the "[[Jefferson Bible]]"—a Bible with all reference to revelations and other miraculous interventions from a deity cut out.

In an 1803 letter to [[Joseph Priestley]], Jefferson states that he conceived the idea of writing his view of the "Christian system" in a conversation with [[Benjamin Rush]] during 1798–99. He proposes beginning with a review of the morals of the ancient philosophers, moving on to the "deism and ethics of the Jews", and concluding with the "principles of a pure deism" taught by Jesus, "omit[ting] the question of his divinity, and even his inspiration."&lt;ref name="Correspondence"&gt;[http://www.cooperativeindividualism.org/jefferson_m_03.html Excerpts from the Correspondence of Thomas Jefferson] Retrieved 12 Jul 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian deists see no paradox in adopting the values and ideals espoused by Jesus without believing he was God. Without providing examples or citations, one author maintains, "A number of influential 17th- and 18th-century thinkers claimed for themselves the title of 'Christian deist' because they accepted both the Christian religion based on revelation and a deistic religion based on natural reason. This deistic religion was consistent with Christianity but independent of any revealed authority. Christian deists often accepted revelation because it could be made to accord with natural or rational religion."&lt;ref&gt;''Jesus Christ in History and Scripture'', Edgar V. McKnight, p. 96 (1999)
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

===Deism===
Deism is a [[Humanism|humanist]] theological position (though encompassing a wide variety of view-points) concerning God's relationship with the [[Nature|natural world]] which emerged during the [[scientific revolution]] of 17th-century Europe and came to exert a powerful influence during the [[Age of Enlightenment|18th-century enlightenment]].

Deists reject atheism,&lt;ref name="González1984"&gt;{{cite book|author=Justo L. González|title=The Reformation to the present day|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GWoHUb5qQccC&amp;pg=PA190|accessdate=14 Aug 2010|year=1984|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=9780060633165|pages=190–}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there were a number of different types of deists in the 17th and 18th century.

Deism holds that God does not intervene with the functioning of the natural world in any way, allowing it to run according to the [[Physical law|laws of nature]] that he configured when he created all things. Because God does not control or interfere with his self-sustaining Creation, its component systems work in concert to achieve the balanced natural processes that make up the physical world. As such, Human beings are "free agents in a free world." A "free agent" is someone who has authority and ability to choose his/her actions and who may make mistakes. A "free world" is one which ordinarily operates as it is designed to operate and permits the consequential properties of failure and accident to be experienced by its inhabitants. God is thus conceived to be wholly [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] and never [[immanent]]. For deists, human beings can only know God via [[reason]] and the observation of nature but not by revelation or supernatural manifestations (such as miracles)—phenomena which deists regard with caution if not skepticism.

Christian deism is one of several branches of deism to have come about over time:
{{quote|Over time there have been other schools of thought formed under the umbrella of deism including Christian deism, belief in deistic principles coupled with the moral teachings of Jesus of Nazareth, and [[Pandeism]], a belief that God became the entire universe and no longer exists as a separate being.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mnn.com/lifestyle/arts-culture/stories/what-is-deism What Is Deism?], Douglas MacGowan, ''[[Mother Nature Network]]'', May 21, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===History===
[[Williston Walker]], in ''A History of the Christian Church'', wrote: "In its milder form, it emerged as 'rational supernaturalism,' but in its central development it took the form of a full Christian Deism, while its radical wing turned against organized religion as anti-Christian Deism."&lt;ref name="Williston Walker 1985"/&gt; "English Deism on the whole was a cautious, Christian Deism, largely restricted in influence to the upper classes. But a radical anti-Christian Deism, militant in its attack on organized Christianity, though with few supporters, accompanied it."&lt;ref&gt;A history of the Christian church, by Williston Walker, 584 (1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

An early Christian deist wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;For God, according to these [[Philosophers]], makes and governs a natural World that is capable of governing itself, and that might have made itself as well, had they not pass'd a needless and insignificant Compliment upon, the Creator. But I hope they will mend their Scheme, and compound this Matter for their own Honour, and not pretend to fay, that God has made a necessary World, or a self-existent System of Creatures. Yet this is the philosophical Scheme of Atheism, which its Patrons would fain call Deism, and in which the Christian Jews or Jewish Christians assist them, by joining inadvertently in the fame Cry. But if this be not a fine Scheme of Philosophy, let Christian Deism stand for an odd Sort of Religion, and let the Christian Jews be for ever orthodox, and be allow'd as the only religious Men in the World. It is certain, that if God governs moral Agents at all, he must; govern them by Hope and Fear, or by such a wise and suitable Application of Rewards and Punishments, as the different Circumstances of Persons, and the Ends of Government require. And these Rewards and Punishments must be such as are not the natural, necessary Consequences of the Actions themselves, themselves, since every one must see that this would be no Government at all, and that the Case, in this Respect, must be the very same whether we suppose any rectoral Justice, or any Presence or Operation of God in the World or not. And yet this which is really no Government at all, is all the general Providence which some seem willing to allow. But since those Gentlemen are all deep Philosophers, and above the gross Ignorance of the common Herd, I would here only ask them, What are the Laws of Nature ? What is the Law of Gravity, the Law of communicating Motion from one Body to another by Impulse, and the Law of the Vis -Inertia of Bodies ? Are these natural, essential and inherent Properties of the Bodies themselves, or are they the regular Effects of some universal, extrinsick Cause acting incessantly upon the whole material System, by such and such general Laws and Conditions of Agency?&lt;ref&gt;The moral philosopher: in a dialogue between Philalethes, a Christian deist and Theophanes a Christian Jew. By Thomas Morgan, 189-190 (1737).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This may give the Reader some Notion of this Writer's Candour and Sincerity, and what we are to think of his pretended Regard for Christianity, which in Effect amounts to this: That the Christianity revealed in the Writings of the New Testament is Jewish Christianity; that is, Christianity corrupted and adulterated with Judaism, which according to him is the worst Religion in the World. But the true and genuine Christianity is Christian Deism, to be learned not from the Writings of the New Testament, but from the Volume of Nature, from every Man's own Breast, from the Heavens, the Earth, and especially the Brute Creatures,the genuine uncorrupted Instructors in our Author's Christianity. So that the "Gentlemen that assume to themselves the Title of Deists, seem resolved that for the future they only shall be called the true Christians too. Those that look upon the New Testament to be divinely inspired, and receive it as the Rule of their Faith, and take their Religion from thence, must be called Christian Jews, who only put a strange Mixture of inconsistent Religions upon the World for Christianity : whereas these Christian Deists teach it in its Purity, and in order to propagate pure uncorrupted Christianity they do their utmost to discard.the Writings of the New Testament, that Is, the Writings that give us aft Account of the Doctrines taught by Christ and his Apostles, But since these Gentlemen will not allow; us the honorable Title of Christians, it is but fair that they should leave us that of Free-Thinkers, to which I really think the Advocates for the Gospel Revelation have a much juster Pretension than they.&lt;ref&gt;''The divine authority of the Old and New Testament asserted'', by John Leland, p viii-ix (1739)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Christian foundation===
In conjunction with deistic perspectives, Christian deism incorporates Christian tenets. Christian deists believe that [[Jesus Christ]] was a deist. Jesus taught that there are two basic laws of God governing humankind. The first law is that life comes from God and we are to use it as God intends, as illustrated in Jesus' parable of the [[Attic talent|talents]]. The second law is that God intends for human beings to live by love for each other, as illustrated in Jesus' parable of the good Samaritan.

Jesus summarized two basic "commandments" or laws of God as "love for God and love for neighbor." These two commandments through Christian deism were known to Jesus from the Hebrew scriptures but Jesus expanded the definition of "neighbor" to include everyone concerned in the natural world. "Love for God" means having appreciation for God as the creator of the world and the source of human life. "Love for neighbor" means having appreciation for the value of every human life. These are not laws or "truths" that Jesus received through some supernatural "revelation" according to Christian deism. In his "parable of the sower," Jesus taught that the "word of God" is known naturally because it is sown "in the heart" of everyone. For instance, the apostle [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]], who was a Jew, recognized that God's laws are known naturally by everyone. Paul wrote, "When Gentiles (non-Jews) who do not have the (Mosaic) law do by nature what the law requires, they are a law to themselves, even though they do not have the law. They show that what the law requires is written on their hearts" (Romans 2:14-15). Christian deism is therefore based on appreciation for all creation and on appreciation for every human life.

In his teachings, Jesus used examples from the natural world and from human nature to explain basic truths about life. In his parables, Jesus spoke of mustard seeds, wheat, weeds, fishing nets, pearls, vineyards, fig trees, salt, candlelight and sheep to illustrate his points. Jesus also used illustrations from human nature to teach basic concepts such as repentance, forgiveness, justice, and love.

Jesus called for people to follow God's laws, or commandments, so the "kingdom of God" could come "on earth as it is in heaven." As Jesus preached the "gospel", or good news, that the "kingdom of God is at hand," Christians deists believe the Romans viewed Jesus as a Jewish revolutionary seeking to liberate the Jews from Roman rule. Jesus refused to stop preaching his "gospel" even though he knew that he was risking crucifixion, the usual Roman penalty for revolutionaries. Jesus called for his followers to take this same risk, "If a man would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. For whoever would save his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake and the gospel's will save it" (Mark 8:34-35).

After his crucifixion, Jesus' cross became a symbol of commitment to establishing the "kingdom of God" on earth. Christian deists are committed to following God's natural laws, as summarized in the two "commandments" to love God and love our neighbor.

==Different schools of thought==
The broad spectrum of thought available within the idea of a Christian deism encompasses models of [[Deism#The history of classical deism|classical deism]] and [[pandeism]] with simple [[Reverence (attitude)|reverence]] for the message of [[Toleration|tolerance]] claimed as espoused by the human Jesus, to belief in Jesus as a sort of naturally occurring divine figure, a mystical product of the rational processes of a rational [[universe]]. An example of the broadness attributed to Christian deism is found in this criticism of the position:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Christian Deist, i.e., a man who alleges that the Christian religion is nothing else than pure natural religion. The Deist, whom he introduces speaking, speaks with great presumption, as the ignorant are accustomed to do: that he neither possessed any acquaintance with the ancient languages nor with history, which he betrays in the very beginning, awakens no good anticipations in favour of Morgan, who appears in the person of the Deist. Morgan alleges with great boldness, that his religion of reason alone is divine, that the Christian is a mere invention and device of man, and through all ages since its introduction, has been regarded as such by a small but oppressed party: that the character of [[Judaism]], which is not only human, but altogether devilish, cleaves still to the followers of a blind faith': that the apostle Paul was the chief of the freethinkers who wished to have no connexion with Judaism, and alone preached Christianity in its purity, whilst the other apostles were merely the chiefs of a political party who in the spirit of Judaism had attached themselves to it.

....

The freer Paulinian party, according to Morgan's view, had been from the first always persecuted and oppressed by the others; and although the Jewish Christians had afterwards fallen asunder and separated into various hostile sects, the same intolerant Jewish spirit still, in a greater or a less degree, animated them all, and they would not consent to relinquish the service of sacrifices; this spirit has given birth to a religion of priests among all those sects, which is immeasurably removed from the true religion. In addition, Morgan will not at all admit that his opinions approach in any respect to atheism, or that his object is to defend any thing similar to it; he alone, as he alleges, is a teacher of the true moral religion. It will not therefore be a matter of surprise, that a division of his book treats of the public forms of divine worship, and especially upon prayer. On the other hand, his Christian Deist will have nothing to do with sacrifices or satisfaction,—nothing with the vicarious death of Christ,—nothing with sacrifices and ceremonies,—with grace or election, which does not depend upon the merit of the person elected.&lt;ref&gt;''History of the Eighteenth Century and of the Nineteenth'', by F.C. Schlosser, p. 47 (1843)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Christian deists do not worship Jesus as God. However, there are differing views concerning the exact nature of Jesus, as well as differing levels of hewing to traditional, orthodox deistic belief on this issue. There are two main theological positions.

===Jesus as the Son of God===
Of the Christian deists who look upon Jesus as the Son of God, (but not God himself), the Christian aspect of their faith is drawn from three main aspects of prior Christian thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enlightenmentdeism.com/?page_id=156 |title=Christian Deism |publisher=Enlightenment Deism |date= |accessdate=2013-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They take a modified view of [[Pelagius]], that there is no need for divine aid in performing good works and that the only "grace" necessary is the declaration of the law. They also hold a mild version of the [[moral influence theory of atonement]] philosophy. They combine these two philosophies with certain aspects of classical [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] theology. Indeed, mainstream deistic thought contributed to the rise of Unitarianism itself, with people in the 19th century increasingly self-identifying as Unitarians rather than as deists.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernest Campbell Mossner|Mossner, Ernest Campbell]] (1967). "Deism". The Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Vol. 2. Collier-MacMillan. pp. 326–336&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jesus as a moral teacher===
Christian deists who do not believe in Jesus as the son of God strongly reject any theories of atonement.

Different theories receive different levels of rejection, the strongest rejection being reserved for the theory of [[penal substitution]], that claims that Jesus had to die as a sacrifice to pay the "death penalty" for humankind and save them from the "wrath" of God. And they do not view God as a whimsical tyrant who sends plagues and pestilence to punish people on earth and who plans to torture people in "[[hell]]" in the future. Christian deists reject these ideas as products of human hatred and a failure to recognize God's natural laws of love for others.

Christian deists consider themselves to be disciples, or students, of Jesus because Jesus taught the natural laws of God. But Christian deists believe that Jesus was only human.&lt;ref&gt;[http://christiandeism.com/Jesus.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100925150953/http://christiandeism.com/Jesus.html |date=25 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus had to struggle with his own times of disappointment, sorrow, anger, prejudice, impatience, and despair, just as other human beings struggle with these experiences. Jesus never claimed to be perfect but he was committed to following God's natural laws of love.

==Diverging from Christianity and deism==
Christian deism can differ from both mainstream deism and orthodox Christianity. This can occasionally be on the same subject but most often, Christian deism finds itself in agreement with one on a given theological topic, only to disagree on the next theological topic.

Christian deism is opposed to the doctrine of predestination in which everything that happens is thought to be the will of God, and instead tend to believe in the concept of free will. [[John Calvin]] was a proponent of the theory of predestination in which God allegedly determines everything that happens, whether good or bad. Christian deists believe that it is never God's will for anyone to be sick or injured. In that bad things occur as a result of prior interactions that resulted in a specified outcome. These bad things may be caused by interfering with naturalistic processes that result in negative consequences to carbon-based life, or by human interaction on the surface of the Earth that leads to degrees of inhospitable conditions for others. Christians deists believe God gifted the human intellect to heal many illnesses, but God does not directly intervene to heal people on demand by some supernatural occurrence. Humans are believed to already have the endowed capacity to create synergies and contribute in some way toward the development of fairer societies on Earth, whether it be through scientific understanding or spiritual enlightenment. However, Christian deists also strongly oppose the mainstream deistic notion that sacred texts like the Bible contain no revealed truths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://christian-deist.blogspot.com/ |title=the christian deist café |publisher=Christian-deist.blogspot.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://christiandeism.com/beliefs/ |title=Beliefs |publisher=Christiandeism.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''chronogram''' is a sentence or inscription in which specific letters, interpreted as [[numeral system|numerals]], stand for a particular date when rearranged. The word, meaning "time writing", derives from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] words ''chronos'' (χρόνος "time") and ''gramma'' (γράμμα, "letter"). 

In the ''pure chronogram'' each word contains a numeral; the ''natural chronogram'' shows all numerals in the correct numerical order, e.g. A'''M'''ORE '''M'''AT'''V'''R'''I'''TAS = MMVI = 2006. Chronograms in [[Metre (poetry)|versification]] are referred to as ''chronosticha'' if they are written in [[hexameter]] and ''chronodisticha'' if they are written in [[distich]].

In the [[History of Indonesia|ancient Indonesian]] Hindu-Buddhist tradition, especially in ancient Java, chronograms were called ''chandrasengkala'' and usually used in inscriptions to signify a given year in the [[Saka]] Calendar. Certain words were assigned their specific number, and poetic phrases were formed from these selected words to describe particular events that have their own numerical meanings. For example, the ''candrasengkala'' "''sirna ilang kertaning bumi''" ("the wealth of earth disappeared and diminished") (''sirna'' = 0, ''ilang'' = 0, ''kerta'' = 4, ''bumi'' = 1) corresponds to the year 1400 in the Saka Calendar (1478 CE), the date of the fall of the [[Majapahit Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://m.thejakartapost.com/news/2003/03/30/sengkalan-mystery-words-and-forms.html Jakarta Post, March 30, 2003: ''Sengkalan: Mystery of words and forms ''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141025144719/http://m.thejakartapost.com/news/2003/03/30/sengkalan-mystery-words-and-forms.html |date=25 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roman numerals==

Chronograms from the [[Roman Empire]] are reported but not confirmed.  The earliest confirmed chronograms using Roman numerals were devised in the mid 14th century but retrospective chronograms which express earlier dates are known.&lt;ref&gt;Chronograms, 5000 and More in Number, James Hilton, google books, page vi.&lt;/ref&gt;  Chronograms were particularly popular during the [[Renaissance]], when chronograms were often used on [[headstone|tombstones]] and foundation stones to mark the date of the event being commemorated. They were popular during the Baroque as well.  In 1711, Joseph Addison compared chronograms to "[[anagram]]s and [[acrostic]]s".&lt;ref&gt;Chronograms, 5000 and More in Number, James Hilton, google books, page xi.&lt;/ref&gt;  Examples include:

[[Image:chronogram Dolany.jpg|left|thumb|Chronogram at statue near church in Dolany ([[Czech Republic]]).&lt;br&gt;'''In honoreM&lt;br&gt; InsIgnIs athLetae&lt;br&gt; DIVI fLorIanI&lt;br&gt; IneXstrVCta'''&lt;br&gt;1729]]

[[File:ChronogrHildesheim.jpg|thumb|Chronogram above the entrance of the [[Hospital of the Five Wounds, Hildesheim|Hospital of the Five Wounds]] in [[Hildesheim]], Germany. &lt;br&gt;'''CV'''ra Bon'''I'''fa'''CII''', Pr'''IM'''o, Q'''V'''o Praef'''VI'''t Anno Abbas Spe'''C'''tatos '''C'''o'''LL'''o'''C'''at Hos '''C'''e'''L'''ares. 1770.]]

*''My Day Closed Is In Immortality'' is a chronogram commemorating the death of Queen [[Elizabeth I of England]]. The capitals read MDCIII, which corresponds to 1603, the year of Elizabeth's death.
*''ChrIstVs DuX ergo trIVMphVs'' ("Christ the Leader, therefore triumphant"), on a coin struck by Gustavus Adolphus in 1627, gives MDCXVVVII or 1627.&lt;ref&gt;The History of Mathematics, Anne Rooney, page 21.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although chronograms are relatively scarce on coins, many inscriptions on medals incorporate chronograms.&lt;ref&gt;Chronograms, 5000 and More in Number, James Hilton, google books, page vii.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In a work entitled ''Hugo Grotius his Sophompaneas'', published in 1652, the date is indicated by the author's name: ''FranCIs GoLDsMIth''. This gives MDCLII or 1652.
*An example of a short chronogram is on the monument commemorating the 1764 Massacre at Madéfalva in Transsylvania. The script [[Siculicidium]](in Latin, meaning "murder of Székelys") written SICVLICIDIVM, gives exactly 1764. Only the beginning letter "S" is not used from the one-word chronogram.

Many lengthy examples of chronograms can be found in Germany and the countries that had been part the [[Holy Roman Empire]], such as Austria, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic. These often commemorate the building of houses in the form of prayers or quotations from the Bible. For instance, ''S'''V'''RGE O '''I'''EHO'''V'''A ATQ'''V'''E '''DI'''SPERGE '''I'''N'''IMIC'''OS T'''V'''OS'' ("Rise, oh Jehovah, and destroy your enemies", a slightly altered version of [[Psalm]] 68:2) gives 1625 as the year of building. One double chronogram, in Latin and English, on the year 1642, reads, "'TV DeVs IaM propItIVs sIs regI regnoqVe hVIC VnIVerso." – "O goD noVV sheVV faVoVr to the kIng anD thIs VVhoLe LanD."  The English sentence demonstrates that the origin of the letter '''w''' as a double '''v''' or '''u''' was recognised historically.
In [[Hildesheim]] in the North of Germany, the inscription "'''CV'''ra Bon'''I'''fa'''CII''', Pr'''IM'''o, Q'''V'''o Praef'''VI'''t Anno Abbas Spe'''C'''tatos '''C'''o'''LL'''o'''C'''at Hos '''C'''e'''L'''ares " showing the year 1770 can be read above the entrance of the [[Hospital of Five Wounds, Hildesheim|Hospital of Five Wounds]] which was built in the year indicated.

==Hebrew numerals==

The great popularity of chronograms in Jewish tradition, and the extent to which they have been cultivated, may be explained by the fact that they are a variety of the Jewish mystical practice of [[Gematria]].

The earliest chronogram in [[Jewish literature]] is one found in a [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] poem of the year 1205 by [[Yehuda Alharizi|Al-Harizi]], while the earliest Latin chronogram is dated five years later. According to [[Abraham Firkovich]], Hebrew chronograms date back to 582; but the inscriptions cited by him are probably forgeries. In the thirteenth century chronograms are found in the epitaphs of German Jews (Lewysohn, "Nafshot Zaddikim", No. 14, of the year 1261; No. 16, of the year 1275).

===In epitaphs===

It is evident, therefore, that for a period of five hundred years chronograms occurred in the epitaphs of European Jews. Thus the dates of the epitaphs of the family of [[Asher ben Jehiel]] in the first half of the fourteenth century are indicated by chronograms (Almanzi, "Abne Zikkaron", pp.&amp;nbsp;4, 6, 9); and among sixty-eight [[Frankfurt|Frankfort]] epitaphs of that century four chronograms have been preserved (Horowitz, "Inschriften... zu Frankfurt-am-Main", Nos. 8, 29, 36, 68). The German Jews seem to have possessed little skill in the composition of chronograms, there being only about twenty-five (and these very simple) in a total of some 6,000 inscriptions. In [[Bohemia]] and [[Poland]], chronograms in epitaphs occur more frequently, and are often very clever; for example, the epitaph of the physician Menahem b. Asher Mazzerato, who died at [[Prague]] in 1680, reads as follows: '''א'''יש '''צ'''דיק '''י'''שר '''ח'''כם '''ו'''ענו '''ה'''אלוף '''מ'''הר״ר '''מ'''נחם '''ר'''ופא '''מ'''ומחה (Lieben, "Gal 'Ed," p.&amp;nbsp;36); and the numerical value of the marked initial letters therein amounts to 440; i.e., 5440, the Jewish year in which Menahem died. The year of death of the associate rabbi of Prague, Zalman, who perished in the great fire of 1689 (=5449 Jewish era), is indicated by the words ''''באש יצא מא'''ת '''ד''' (bolded letters equal 448) (ib. No. 59).

===In books===
While the epitaphs, in addition to the chronograms, in many cases directly mention the dates, many manuscripts, and an even greater number of printed books, are dated simply by means of chronograms; authors, copyists, and typographers rivaling one another in hiding the dates in intricate chronograms, most difficult to decipher. Hence, many data of Jewish [[bibliography]] still remain to be determined, or at least rectified. Down to recent times the custom of indicating dates by means of chronograms was so prevalent in Jewish literature that all but few books are dated by numerals only. In the earliest printed books the chronograms consist of one or two words only: the Soncino edition of the [[Talmud]], for instance, has for its date the earliest printed chronogram, גמרא ("Gemara") = 244 (1484 C.E.). Words like רננו ("rejoice ye!"), שמחה ("joy"), ברנה ("with rejoicing") were especially used for this purpose, as they express happiness. Later on, entire verses of the Bible, or sentences from other books, having some reference to the contents or title of the book, or to the name of the author, publisher, printer, etc., were used. In longer sentences, in which some of the letters were not utilized in the chronogram, those that counted were marked by dots, lines, or different type, or were distinguished in other ways. Innumerable errors have been made by bibliographers because the distinguishing marks were missing or blotted, or had been omitted. To this source of confusion must be added the varying methods of indicating the "thousand" of the Jewish [[calendar era|era]]. The Italian, [[Oriental]], and earlier [[Amsterdam]] editions frequently designate the thousand as {{lang|he|לפ״ג}} &lt;span style="direction:ltr" dir="ltr"&gt;(&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{lang|he|לפרט גדול}}, "the major era")&lt;/span&gt;. The German and Polish editions omit the thousand, considering only {{lang|he|לפ״ק}} &lt;span style="direction:ltr" dir="ltr"&gt;(&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{lang|he|לפרט קטן}}, "the minor era")&lt;/span&gt;; but as neither the former nor the latter is employed throughout the respective editions, many errors arise. The following chronogram, which Rabbi [[Samuel Schotten]] adds to his work "Kos ha-Yeshu'ot" ([[Frankfurt|Frankfort-on-the-Main]], 1711), shows how artificial and verbose chronograms may be: "Let him who wishes to know the year of the Creation pour the contents out of the cup [i.e., count the word "kos," כוס with defective spelling = 80] and seek aid [{{lang|he|ישועה}}&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="direction:ltr" dir="ltr"&gt;=&amp;nbsp;391; together 471]&lt;/span&gt; in the sixth millennium." The days of the month and week are indicated in the same way.

Many important years in [[Jewish history]] are indicated by their respective chronograms; e.g., the year 1492 by מזרה ("scatterer" = 252, after Jer. xxi. 10, which says that God scattered Israel). This was the year when the Jews were expelled from Spain ([[Abarbanel|Abravanel]]'s Introduction to his Commentary on [[Books of Kings|Kings]]).

===In poetry===

[[Neo-Hebraic poetry]], which laid especial stress on the formal side of verse, also cultivated chronograms. A number of Hebrew poems were produced in the first half of the 19th century, in which the letters of each verse have the same numerical value, being generally the year in which it was written. A New-year's poem in this style, written in the year 579 (=1819), is found in Shalom Cohen's "Ketab Yosher" (ed. [[Warsaw]], p.&amp;nbsp;146). Two years later [[Jacob Eichenbaum]] wrote a poem in honor of a friend, each line of which had the numerical value of 581 ("Kol Zimrah", ed. [[Leipzig|Leipsic]], pp.&amp;nbsp;50–53). While this poem is really a work of art, in spite of the artifice employed, Eichenbaum's imitators have in their translations merely produced rimes with certain numerical values. [[Gottlober]] (in "Ha-Kokabim", i. 31) wrote an excellent satire on these rimesters, each line of his poem having the numerical value of 618 (=1858). The first two verses of the poem are as follows:

{{rtl-para|he|עם הלפקים כה אריבה&lt;br/&gt;
ולאלה כגמול ידם להם אשיבה}}

But even poets like [[I. L. Gordon]] and [[A. B. Lewensohn]] have a great weakness for the לפקים ("minor eras"), though employing them only in the super-scriptions to their poems.

'''Conception dreams''' are [[dream]]s that are said to foretell the [[Fertilisation|conception]] or [[birth]] of a child, dreamt by the future mother or people close to her. The belief that a dream will foretell a baby's birth originates from Ancient [[India]]&lt;ref&gt;Beal, Samuel, transl. (1875), The romantic legend of Sâkya Buddha (Abhiniṣkramaṇa Sūtra), London: Trübner&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/details/romanticlegendof00ahbi&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Mahāvastu, Sacred Books of the Buddhists, 2, London: Luzac &amp; Co&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/details/sacredbooksofbud18londuoft&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dreaming in the Lotus: Buddhist Dream Narrative, Imagery, and Practice By Serinity Young&lt;/ref&gt; and is found in some Asian countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asdreams.org/2003/abstracts/nah-ree_doh.htm|title=Psychological significance of Korean women's "conception dreams"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In India==
Ancient India believes that conception dream predicts the child character. [[Maya (mother of the Buddha)]] dreamt that a white elephant with six white tusks entered her right side.&lt;ref&gt;Beal, Samuel, transl. (1875), The romantic legend of Sâkya Buddha (Abhiniṣkramaṇa Sūtra), London: Trübner&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/details/romanticlegendof00ahbi&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Mahāvastu, Sacred Books of the Buddhists, 2, London: Luzac &amp; Co&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/details/sacredbooksofbud18londuoft&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Jainism]] dreams are connected with the births of [[Tirthankara]]s and the other prominent people including ''[[chakravarti]]'', ''[[Balabhadra]]''s and ''Vāsudevas''. They are 63 in total and called ''[[Shalakapurusha]]''. Their mothers see a certain number of dreams on conception of their soul in womb. They are described in the great detail in [[Kalpa Sūtra|Kalpasutra]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jainpedia.org/nc/themes/principles/holy-symbols/dreams.html?sword_list%5B0%5D=dreams&amp;cHash=33eba476582356cda9587de0d285a3b9Balbir, Nalini.

==In Korea==
In Korea conception dreams are known as 태몽(''taemong''). Many women in Korean culture report having such dreams themselves. Popular topics of the dreams include fruit (such apples, [[persimmon]]s, cherries, chestnuts), animals (tigers, snakes, goldfish), nature (rivers, rainbows), children and jewels. The dreamer might eat or take fruits, embrace animals, or interact with nature. The topic is believed to influence the [[gender]] or the future of the baby; for example, fruits are seen as a sign for a baby girl.

The person having the dream can be the mother herself, but close family members such as her mother or the husband can also have conception dreams instead of the mother.

Dreams are often considered to be [[omen]]s, and sometimes people will "buy" dreams from friends, if they feel it is a good omen or a good conception dream.

Accounts of conception dreams can be found in numerous old histories. One example is the conception dream of [[Kim Yushin]], from the 6th century [[Common Era|CE]], documented in the [[Samguk Sagi]].

The ''' conservation and restoration of vinyl discs''' refers to the preventive measures taken to defend against damage and slow degradation, and to maintain [[fidelity]] of singles, 12" singles, EP, LP in  45 or 33⅓ rpm [[Gramophone record|disc]] [[Sound recording and reproduction|recordings]]. LPs are most often in the 12” format, although very early [[gramophone record|vinyl]] recordings were 10”. Vinyl LP preservation is generally considered separate from conservation, which refers to the repair and stabilization of individual discs. Commonly practiced in major sound archives and research [[libraries]] that house large collections of [[Sound recording and reproduction|audio]] recordings, it is also frequently followed by [[audiophiles]] and home record collectors. Because [[Vinyl group|vinyl]]—a virtually unbreakable light plastic made up of polyvinyl chloride acetate copolymer, or [[PVC]]—is considered the most stable of analog recording media, it is seen as less a concern for deterioration than earlier sound recordings made from more fragile materials such as acetate, vulcanite, or [[shellac]]. This hardly means that vinyl recordings are infallible, however, and research—both expert and evidential—has shown that the way in which discs are handled and cared for can have a profound effect on their [[longevity]]. Though some [[Gramophone record|45s]] (7”s) are also made from vinyl, many of them are actually [[polystyrene]]—a more fragile medium that is prone to fracturing from internal stress.&lt;ref&gt;McWilliams, Jerry. ''The Preservation and Restoration of Sound Recordings,'' page 42. Nashville: American Association for State and Local History, 1979. '', page 42&lt;/ref&gt; Still, many of the recommendations for the care of vinyl LPs can be applied to 45s.

Library of Congress Study, 1959.]]
[[File:Fonoteca Nacional 01.JPG|thumbnail|right|Modern vinyl disc machine cleaning at the Fonoteca Nacional (National Sound Archive of Mexico)]]

== Historical development and standards ==

In 1959—roughly a decade after [[gramophone record|vinyl]] LPs first became widely available to [[consumer]]s—the [[Library of Congress]] published ''Preservation of Sound Recordings'' (A.G. Pickett and M.M. Lemcoe), the first and most extensive investigation of the deterioration of grooved discs and [[magnetic tape]]. Funded by a grant from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]], the purpose of the investigation was to establish suitable guidelines for the storage and preservation of [[sound recordings]] for libraries. Conducted at the Southwest Research Institute of San Antonio, the study involved subjecting sound recordings to a series of lab tests, from accelerated aging to fungal exposure. Though considered the definitive study in the field, the chemical makeup of [[plastics]] and how they perform under stress was the primary focus of the report, whereas playback deterioration—a significant concern to sound archivists and record collectors—was excluded from the investigation.&lt;ref&gt;Pickett, A. G., and M. M. Lemcoe. ''Preservation and Storage of Sound Recordings,'' page iv. Washington: Library of Congress, 1959.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Preservation and Restoration of Sound Recordings'' (Jerry McWilliams), published in 1979 by the American Association of State and Local History, did include information about disc wear through playback, and is still a practical source of information on sound recording preservation. A comprehensive manual based on reports gathered from library professionals, sound [[archivists]], audio engineers, and other experts, it included information on such topics as disc damage from frequency of use, stylus wear, and inferior or improperly adjusted equipment.

In 1986 the Association of Recorded Sound Collections (ARSC) Associated Archives (AAA) Committee received a grant from the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] to conduct an in-depth study in order to identify the problems of preservation and access for sound recordings. Their 860-page report, titled ''Audio Preservation, A Planning Study'' was published in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;Swartzburg, Susan G. ''Preserving Library Materials: A Manual," page 201. N.J.: Scarecrow Press, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the shift from [[Analog signal|analog]] to [[digital recording]], research in the preservation of sound recordings has been in serious decline. Gerald L. Gibson, the head of the Motion Picture, Broadcasting, and Recorded Sound Division of the [[Library of Congress]] expressed his concern on this issue in 1991, by referencing an investigation on the effects of fire on sound and audiovisual recordings as some of the only new research being done on the topic, stating, “Comparatively little is known about the preservation, conservation, aging problems, or properties of sound recordings…virtually no independent work is going on in these areas.” (Gerald L. Gibson, Head of the Motion Picture, Broadcasting, and Recorded Sound Division of the Library of Congress, 1991).&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, Gerald D. “Preservation and Conservation of Sound Recordings,” page 27 in ''Conserving and Preserving Materials in Nonbook Formats''. Henderson, Kathryn L. and William T., editors. Urbana-Champaign, Ill.: University of Illinois, Graduate School of Library and Information Science, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though guidelines and recommendations for the care, handling, and proper storage of vinyl LPs are available from such resources as The Library of Congress and the [[National Library of Canada]], to this date there are no nationally agreed upon standards for audio preservation.&lt;ref name=arl&gt;Association of Research Libraries, [http://www.arl.org/bm~doc/stsrfinal.pdf Letter to National Recording Preservation Board], Library of Congress&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2007, a five-page letter was sent to the National Recording Preservation Board at the Library of Congress on behalf of the Association of Research Libraries (ARL) in support of a study on the current state of recorded sound preservation in the United States, stating “the lack of agreed upon standards and commonly accepted best practices presents a major barrier to effective audio preservation.”(Prudence S. Adler, Associate Executive Director and Karla L. Hahn, Director, Office of Scholarly Communication, Association of Research Libraries, Jan. 2007)&lt;ref name=arl /&gt;

== Recommendations ==

Though recommendations for LP preservation differ among professionals, the majority are in agreement on some basic [[guidelines]]: discs need to be kept clean, stored in such a way to prevent distortion, and maintained in a stable, climate-controlled environment. Routine [[Preventive maintenance|maintenance]] of [[Phonograph|turntable]] equipment including regular inspection of the weight, tracking, and condition of the [[stylus]] is also advised.

=== Cleaning ===

Though proper methods are debated, [[Parts cleaning|cleaning]] is extremely important in maintaining the [[fidelity]] of LPs. As Gibson stated, “As with most things in the field, there is very little certainty regarding cleaning. What is known is based on trial-and-error, not upon controlled, scientific study…however, one thing is certain: playing a dirty recording, regardless of its format, is one of the most damaging things you can do to it.”(Gerald L. Gibson, Head of the Motion Picture, Broadcasting, and Recorded Sound Division of the Library of Congress, 1991)&lt;ref name="Gibson, Gerald D. 1991"&gt;Gibson, Gerald D. “Preservation and Conservation of Sound Recordings,” page 32 in ''Conserving and Preserving Materials in Nonbook Formats''.

It is imperative that LPs be kept free from foreign matter deposits. [[Oils]] from fingerprints, adhesives, and soot are damaging, as are air [[pollutants]] like cigarette smoke. Even [[Petroleum|grease]] from cooking can deposit itself on LPs. Probably the number one contributor to damage, however, is ordinary household [[dust]]. Dust can become embedded permanently into the disc’s grooves, causing distortion of the transmitting signal, ticks, pops, and inferior sound quality. Vinyl discs can become so dirty and scratched that they are virtually unlistenable.

It is recommended that discs be cleaned before—and after—each playback, carbon-fibre brushes are quite effective. Records should be cleaned in a circular motion, in the direction of the grooves. [[Distilled water]] (not tap water as it will leave behind mineral deposits) and a soft, lint-free cloth is a common method of cleaning. Another method is to clean the LP on the turntable with a disc cleaning brush (the Discwasher system is frequently recommended by the audio press).&lt;ref&gt;McWilliams, Jerry. ''The Preservation and Restoration of Sound Recordings,'' page 60. Nashville: American Association for State and Local History, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; A simple "cleaning bath" device called the Spin Clean gives good results,{{according to whom|date=November 2015}}  and there are also vacuum machines on the market such as the Nitty Gritty, Keith Monks, Clearaudio, and VPI, which are recommended for more a thorough cleaning.&lt;ref name="Gibson, Gerald D. 1991"/&gt; In recent years, ultrasonic cleaning machines from manufacturers such as Klaudio (Korea) and Audio Desk Systeme (Germany) have also been used with great success. The effectiveness of the ultrasonic machines coupled with their premium price tags (both $4,000 US in January 2015) has opened the door for companies to offer professional ultrasonic cleaning at an affordable cost of just a few dollars per record.&lt;ref&gt;Stereophile review of Audio Desk Systeme Vinyl Cleaner [http://www.stereophile.com/content/audio-desk-systeme-vinyl-cleaner] Websites for professional ultrasonic cleaning service  [http://originalsvinyl.com][http://recordgenie.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Another cleaning product recently released called Record Revirginizer uses a polymer that is applied to record surface then left to dry, the polymer is then peeled from the surface taking the microscopic contaminants with it.&lt;ref&gt;Queensland university student restores retro records [http://newsmaker.com.au/news/2741] Official Website [http://recordrevirginizer.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Though in the past, using [[alcohol]] on vinyl LPs was considered safe, experts now caution against it unless absolutely necessary, as alcohol threatens the loss of the plasticizer or stabilizer.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, Gerald D. “Preservation and Conservation of Sound Recordings,” page 33 in ''Conserving and Preserving Materials in Nonbook Formats''. Henderson, Kathryn L. and William T., editors. Urbana-Champaign, Ill.: University of Illinois, Graduate School of Library and Information Science, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; As vinyl is often prone to electrostatic charges that cause dust and debris to be attracted to its surface, anti-static products can be used if needed.

Other recommendations for the care, handling, and storage of LPs include the following:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/preserv/care/record.html Cylinder, Disc, and Tape Care in A Nutshell], Library of Congress&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collectionscanada.ca/6/28/s28-10190e.html The Preservation of Recorded Sound Materials], National Library of Canada&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Handling ===
* When possible, use clean, white, lint-free gloves for handling.
* Handle by edge and label areas only, with the third and fourth fingers balancing the label and the thumb supporting the rim.
* Remove from jacket by bowing the jacket open and holding it against the body and letting the LP with its inner sleeve slide out gently (following the same method for removing the inner sleeve).
* Do not expose to air or light unnecessarily. Return LPs to their jackets immediately after playback.

=== Storing ===
* Store exactly vertically to prevent [[wikt:warp|warp]]ing. Spacers are recommended for every four to six inches.
* Store LPs with other LPs. Avoid mixing with other sizes such as 10″ and 7″ discs. Never use bookends.
* Store on metal shelves (as opposed to wood, which expands and contracts).
* Do not allow LPs to hang over the edge of shelves.
* Remove shrink wrap from dust jackets immediately after acquiring.
* Use polyethylene inner sleeves. Never use PVC sleeves as their chemical makeup is too close to vinyl and may cause imprints or fuse to the LP.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, Gerald D. “Preservation and Conservation of Sound Recordings,” page 34 in ''Conserving and Preserving Materials in Nonbook Formats''. Henderson, Kathryn L. and William T., editors. Urbana-Champaign, Ill.: University of Illinois, Graduate School of Library and Information Science, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; Replace paper sleeves as paper deteriorates, leaving oil and paper residue.
* Store in-use LPs at a temperature of {{convert|65|to|70|F|C}}. Those in long-term storage should be kept at {{convert|45|to|50|F|C}}. Though [[relative humidity]] (RH) is considered less an issue for vinyl than other recorded media,&lt;ref&gt;McWilliams, Jerry. ''The Preservation and Restoration of Sound Recordings,'' page 42. Nashville: American Association for State and Local History, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; it is recommended that LPs be stored at 45 to 50% RH.

=== Playback equipment ===

* The stylus tip should be kept clean at all times. A soft, camelhair brush is recommended with a drop of Discwasher solution. Only clean from back to front.
* The stylus should be periodically inspected as it is gradually worn by use. Never play LPs with a worn stylus.
* Maintain proper tracking force. If too high, the stylus will bear down on the groove walls of the LP; if too low, the stylus will bounce in the groove.&lt;ref&gt;McWilliams, Jerry. ''The Preservation and Restoration of Sound Recordings,'' page 74. Nashville: American Association for State and Local History, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reformatting ===

As vinyl recordings are known to degrade after repeated playback, preservation copying is recommended for archival purposes. This is especially true for rare recordings or those that have special value. A general guideline is to digitise the recording using the appropriate stylus, tracking weight, equalisation curve and other playback parameters and use high-quality analogue-to-digital converters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iasa-web.org/tc04/audio-preservation ''Guidelines on the Production and Preservation of Digital Audio Objects'' (IASA TC04)]  International Association of Sound and Audiovisual Archives 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; A service copy of the recording can then be created (on CD or other format) from the preservation master. A second option is to create three copies, the second copy acting as a duplicating master and the third for public use.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7353">The '''Consorzio ICoN''' is an interuniversity consortium for [[Italian Studies]] established in 1999. It consists of 21 Italian universities and focuses on [[philology]] and [[cultural studies]]. The consortium is based and administrated at the [[University of Pisa]] and is supported by the Italian [[Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (Italy)|Ministry of University and Research]] (''Ministero dell'Università e della Ricerca''). It aims at diffusing Italian language, culture and literature.

* [[Ca' Foscari University of Venice]] (Università "Cà Foscari" di Venezia)

== Bachelor's degree ==

The [[University of Pisa]], in collaboration with the consortium, offers a [[bachelor's degree]] program in Italian [[philology]] and [[cultural studies]] (Corso di laurea triennale in ''Lingua e cultura italiana per stranieri'') for foreigners and expatriates, based on [[distance education]] and [[e-learning]]. The program refers to the bachelor's degree class L-10 (literary studies) and offers four majors in

* [[linguistics]] and [[didactics]],
* [[literature]],
* [[arts]] and
* [[history]] and [[culture]].

Exams are carried out at institutions in the country of residence (partner universities, Italian embassies). The title will be issued by the administrative university, actually Pisa, mentioning all participating universities. As Italy is part of [[European Higher Education Area]], the program has a value of 180 [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System|ECTS]] points and permits to participate in a [[Master's degree]] program.

== Master's degrees ==

The ICoN consortium organizes three [[executive master's degree]]s (60 [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System|ECTS]]) in the field of Italian studies. They consist of phases of attendance, distance education and e-learning. The offer includes

* [[Translation|Specialized translation]] (English–Italian), issued by the Universities of [[University of Pisa|Pisa]], [[University of Bari|Bari]] and [[University of Genoa|Genoa]]
* [[Didactics]] of Italian language and literature, issued by the Foreigner Universities of [[University for Foreigners Perugia|Perugia]] and [[Foreigners University of Siena|Siena]]
* [[Cultural heritage management]], issued by the [[University of Parma]]

== Language courses ==

The consortium ICoN also offers language courses and programs in written Italian at distinct levels. For native English speakers special packages have been designed in collaboration with the [[National Italian American Foundation]] and the [[University of California, Los Angeles|University of California]]'s department of Italian. The courses have been awarded with the [[European Commission]]'s ''European Language Label''.

'''''Darwin's Angel''''' is a book published in response to [[Richard Dawkins]]' ''[[The God Delusion]]''. It was written by [[John Cornwell (writer)|John Cornwell]] and subtitled ''An Angelic Riposte to The God Delusion''.

Cornwell runs a "Public Understanding of Science" programme at [[Jesus College, Cambridge]], one of the constituent colleges of the [[University of Cambridge]]. He has previously written reviews of religious and scientific books, including other works of Dawkins. He stated that he finds ''The God Delusion'' harmful in its failure to tackle the problem of extremism, and wrong on many important issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A great debate for heaven's sake |work=Cambridge Evening News |url=http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/news/features/2007/09/17/01a992cd-b6a6-44a4-96aa-30ea96d47914.lpf |accessdate=5 October 2007 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
In this book, Cornwell adopts the persona of the [[guardian angel]] of [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Gregor Mendel]], who is now looking after [[Richard Dawkins]]. He pens a letter to Dawkins in 21 chapters.&lt;ref&gt;The summaries here are quotes or direct paraphrases from the relevant chapters of Darwin's Angel.&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''A Summary of your Argument'' suggests that Dawkins regards all claims about God's existence as "the exclusive province of science and reason".
# ''Your Sources'' suggests that the book ignores distinguished scholarship and uses inappropriate sources.
# ''Imagination'' suggests that Dawkins takes things too literally.
# ''Beauty'' suggests that Dawkins misunderstands the links between beauty, creativity and faith, and suggests he studies [[George Steiner]], [[William Blake]], [[T. S. Eliot]] and [[C. S. Lewis]].
# ''What is Religion'' suggests that religion is not science and that Dawkins should study sociologists of religion such as [[Émile Durkheim]].
# ''Is God Supernatural?'' claims that Dawkins' image of God is not what most theists believe in.
# ''Celestial Teapots'' suggests that the comparison with [[Russell's teapot]] is misplaced because Cornwell claims there are ''prima facie'', albeit inconclusive, grounds for believing in God.
# ''God's Simplicity'' claims that Dawkins imagines that God is an object but this is not how theologians think about God. 
# ''Theories of Everything'' claims that [[Stephen Hawking]] and others now believe a "[[Theory of Everything]]" is impossible due to [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]].
# ''Dawkins versus Dostoyevsky'' suggests that Dawkins mistakenly attributes the nihilistic views of [[Ivan Karamazov]] to [[Dostoyevsky]]. Dawkins responded to this chapter specifically by saying that he was either misunderstood or misquoted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://richarddawkins.net/article,1610,Honest-Mistakes-or-Willful-Mendacity,Richard-Dawkins Richard Dawkins' Response to Cornwell] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011120904/http://richarddawkins.net/article%2C1610%2CHonest-Mistakes-or-Willful-Mendacity%2CRichard-Dawkins |date=11 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Jesus, the Jews and the "Pigs"'' suggests that Dawkins relies on a single source when he discusses "the moral consideration for others" in Judaism and Christianity being originally intended to apply only to a narrowly defined in-group.
# ''Dawkins's Utopia'' claims that Lenin, Stalin, Mao and Hitler all used "science as an ideology combined with militant atheism".&lt;ref&gt;Darwin's Angel p 86&lt;/ref&gt; He also claims that Stalin's atheism was foundational to his entire ideology, and that as atheism doesn't necessarily lead to violence, nor does religion.
# ''Fundamentalism'' suggests that it is important to distinguish between tolerant and violent forms of faith. Cornwell also claims it is a [[Category mistake|category error]] to confuse creationism and the "doctrine of creation".&lt;ref&gt;''ibid.'' p 98&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Is Religious Education Child Abuse?'' questions whether being indoctrinated in a faith is tantamount to child abuse. He goes on to claim the [[Amish]] are a living testimony to the advantages of frugality and simplicity.
# ''Life After Death'' suggests that most religious believers ''hope'' for an afterlife,&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Kenny argues that this is theologically unsound. Christians don't just hope for an afterlife, Christians "affirm in the creeds belief in a final judgement, a resurrection of the body, and an everlasting life."&lt;/ref&gt; In Dawkins' response to the book, he criticised Cornwell for quoting him out of context in this section. 
# ''Religious People Less Clever than Atheists?'' suggests that scientific eminence does not guarantee sound judgement, and that scientists are prejudiced against religious believers. 
# ''Does our Moral Sense have a Darwinian Origin?'' claims that there is more to morality than evolution can explain.
# ''The Darwinian Imperative'' claims that attempts to explain religion via evolution are simplistic. 
# ''Religion as a Bacillus'' discusses Dr [[Gerhard Wagner (Nazi physician)|Gerhard Wagner]], and states that describing all religious believers as infected with a virus has deplorable overtones.&lt;ref&gt;DA p 141-145.&lt;/ref&gt; 
# ''Does God Exist?'' suggests that Dawkins does not understand the question "why is there something rather than nothing?", which is why he finds it ridiculous.&lt;ref&gt;DA pp152-153.&lt;/ref&gt; Cornwell goes on to say "the ludicrous anthropomorphic deity that rightly appals" Dawkins is not the view of God most Christian theologians hold.
# ''Being Religious'' suggests that being religious is not a question of factual beliefs but a personal relationship and quest based on prayer and love.

==Reviews and comments==

The book was praised by [[Salley Vickers]] in ''[[The Times]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/non-fiction/article2361294.ece ''Darwin's Angel: An Angelic Response to the God Delusion''], 1 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Madeleine Bunting]] in ''[[The Guardian]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Madeleine Bunting]] [http://commentisfree.guardian.co.uk/madeleine_bunting/2007/09/the_smallest_signs_of_retreat.html ''The smallest signs of retreat''] [[The Guardian]] 6 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Polkinghorne]] in ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]''&lt;ref&gt;[[John Polkinghorne]] [http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/the_tls/article2778493.ece "The truth in religion"] [[The Times Literary Supplement|TLS]] 31 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Peter Stanford]] in ''[[The Independent]]''&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Stanford]] [[The Independent]] 14 September 2007 [http://arts.independent.co.uk/books/reviews/article2959467.ece Doubts about Dawkins] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071022042200/http://arts.independent.co.uk/books/reviews/article2959467.ece |date=22 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was named one of the 'Books of the Year' by the ''[[Financial Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;FT Magazine 8/9 Dec 2007 ''The Year in Books'' p37.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anthony Kenny]] reviewed the book in ''[[The Tablet]]'' noting that both Cornwell and Dawkins fail to observe the prime rule of intellectual debate, that one should attack the opponent's arguments, not his personality. Kenny goes on to say that neither ''The God Delusion'' nor ''Darwin's Angel'' "provides the reader with sufficient grounds for a reasoned conclusion" about God's existence.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony Kenny]] in [[The Tablet]] 13 September 2007 [http://www.thetablet.co.uk/reviews/359 Argument not always angelic]&lt;/ref&gt; A profile of ''Darwin's Angel'' in ''[[New Scientist]]'' by Amanda Gefter criticised Cornwell for confusing two meanings of "religion" demarcated in ''[[The God Delusion]]'' and for holding one religion in higher esteem than any other. She also suggested that both books are part of a modern debate that is suffering from the fact that the two sides do not concentrate on one definition of religion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19526221.800-review-ian-angelic-riposte-to-the-god-delusioni-by-john-cornwell.html Review: ''An angelic riposte to the God Delusion'' by John Cornwell – 22 September 2007 – New Scientist Space&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Darwin's Angel'' is listed on the RichardDawkins.net website as one of several "fleas" following ''The God Delusion''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The fleas are multiplying |url=http://old.richarddawkins.net/articles/1617-the-fleas-are-multiplying |accessdate=12 September 2007 |work=www.RichardDawkins.net |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140121235026/http://old.richarddawkins.net/articles/1617-the-fleas-are-multiplying |archivedate=21 January 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Dawkins, the book contains a number of inaccurate portrayals of what he actually said.

{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Deus ex machina''}}
[[File:Medea rappresentation (2009) 07.JPG|thumb|''Deus ex machina'' in classical theatre: Euripides' ''[[Medea (play)|Medea]]'', performed in 2009 in Syracuse, Italy]]

'''''Deus ex machina''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈdeʊs ɛks ˈmaː.kʰɪ.naː|lang}}: {{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|eɪ|.|ə|s|_|ɛ|k|s|_|ˈ|m|ɑː|k|iː|n|ə}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|iː|ə|s|_|ɛ|k|s|_|ˈ|m|æ|k|ᵻ|n|ə}};&lt;ref&gt;''[[Random House Dictionary]]''&lt;/ref&gt; plural: ''dei ex machina''; English ‘god from the machine’) is a [[plot device]] whereby a seemingly unsolvable problem in a story is suddenly and abruptly resolved by an unexpected and seemingly unlikely occurrence, typically so much as to seem contrived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary | title=deus ex machina | dictionary=Merriam-Webster | accessdate=23 Apr 2018 | url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/deus%20ex%20machina}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.britannica.com/art/deus-ex-machina | title=Deus ex machina | website=Encyclopaedia Britannica | accessdate=23 Apr 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its function can be to resolve an otherwise irresolvable plot situation, to surprise the audience, to bring the tale to a [[happy ending]], or act as a comedic device.

==Origin of the expression==
''Deus ex machina'' is a Latin [[calque]] {{ety|gre|''ἀπὸ μηχανῆς θεός'' (apò mēkhanês theós)|god from the machine}}.&lt;ref&gt;One of the earliest occurrences of the phrase is in fragment 227 of [[Menander]]: ἀπὸ μηχανῆϛ θεὸς ἐπεφάνηϛ "You are by your epiphany a veritable god from the machine", as quoted in ''The Woman Possessed with a Divinity'', as translated in ''Menander: The Principal Fragments'' (1921) by [[:de:Francis Greenleaf Allinson|Francis Greenleaf Allinson]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was coined from the conventions of [[Greek tragedy]], where a machine is used to bring actors playing gods onto the stage. The machine could be either a crane (''[[mechane]]'') used to lower actors from above or a riser that brought actors up through a trapdoor. Preparation to pick up the actors was done behind the ''[[Skene (theatre)|skene]]''. The idea was introduced by [[Aeschylus]] and was used often to resolve the conflict and conclude the drama. Although the device is associated mostly with Greek tragedy, it also appeared in comedies.&lt;ref name="machine"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chondros |first1=Thomas G. |last2=Milidonis |first2=Kypros|last3=Vitzilaios |first3=George |last4=Vaitsis|first4=John |title="Deus-Ex-Machina" reconstruction in the Athens theater of Dionysus |journal=Mechanism and Machine Theory |date=September 2013 |volume=67 |pages=172–191 |doi=10.1016/j.mechmachtheory.2013.04.010}}&lt;!--|accessdate=15 December 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient examples===
[[Aeschylus]] used the device in his ''[[The Eumenides|Eumenides]]'', but it was with [[Euripides]] that it became an established stage machine. More than half of Euripides' extant [[tragedy|tragedies]] employ a ''deus ex machina'' in their resolution, and some critics claim that Euripides, not Aeschylus, invented it.&lt;ref&gt;Rehm (1992, 72) and Walton (1984, 51).&lt;/ref&gt; A frequently cited example is Euripides' ''[[Medea (play)|Medea]]'', in which the ''deus ex machina'', a dragon-drawn chariot sent by the sun god, is used to convey his granddaughter [[Medea]], who has just committed murder and [[infanticide]], away from her husband [[Jason]] to the safety and civilization of Athens. In ''[[Alcestis (play)|Alcestis]]'', the [[eponymous]] heroine agrees to give up her own life in order to spare the life of her husband, Admetus. At the end, [[Heracles]] shows up and seizes Alcestis from [[Thanatos|Death]], restoring her to life and to Admetus.

[[Aristophanes]]' play ''[[Thesmophoriazusae]]'' parodies Euripides' frequent use of the crane by making Euripides himself a character in the play and bringing him on stage by way of the ''mechane''.

The effect of the device on Greek audiences was a direct and immediate emotional response. Audiences would have a feeling of wonder and astonishment at the appearance of the gods, which would often add to the moral effect of the drama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cunningham |first1=Maurice P.|title=Medea ΑΠΟ ΜΗΧΑΝΗΣ|journal=Classical Philology |date=July 1954 |volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=151–160 |jstor = 265931 |doi = 10.1086/363788 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=28 September 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern theatrical examples===
[[Shakespeare]] used the device in ''[[As You Like It]]'', ''[[Pericles, Prince of Tyre]]'', ''[[Cymbeline]]''  and ''[[The Winter's Tale]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Rehm (1992, 70).&lt;/ref&gt; It was also used in John Gay's ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]'' where the author uses a character to break the action and rewrite the ending as a reprieve of the hanging of MacHeath. Both in Shakespeare's and Gay's plays the ''deus ex machina'' happens with breaking the dramatic illusion often in the form of an episodic narrator exposing the play itself and laying bare the author. This is different from the use of the ''deus ex machina'' in the ancient examples with the ending coming from a participant in the action in the form of a god. It is natural for the gods to be considered participants and not outside sources because of their privileged position and power. It is these attributes that allow the Greek gods to believably wrap up and solve the series of events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dunn|first1=Francis M|title=Tragedy's End : Closure and Innovation in Euripidean Drama: Closure and Innovation in Euripidean Drama |date=1996 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the politically turbulent 17th and 18th&amp;nbsp;centuries, the ''deus ex machina'' was sometimes used to make a controversial thesis more palatable to the powers of the day. For example, in the final scene of [[Molière]]'s ''[[Tartuffe]]'' the heroes are saved from a terrible fate by an agent of the compassionate, all-seeing [[Louis XIV|king]] — the same king that held Molière's career and livelihood in his hands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novelguide.com/a/discover/dfs_18/dfs_18_00023.html "Tartuffe: Novel Guide"]. 2003. Retrieved 2&amp;nbsp;November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot device==
[[Aristotle]] was the first to use a Greek term equivalent to the Latin phrase ''deus ex machina'' as a term to describe the technique as a device to resolve the plot of tragedies.&lt;ref name=machine /&gt; It is generally deemed undesirable in writing and often implies a lack of creativity on the part of the author. The reasons for this are that it does not pay due regard to the story's internal logic (although it is sometimes deliberately used to do this) and is often so unlikely that it challenges [[suspension of disbelief]], allowing the author to conclude the story with an unlikely, though perhaps more palatable, ending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.cn.edu/kwheeler/lit_terms_D.html |title=Literary Terms and Definitions: D |author= Dr. L. Kip Wheeler |accessdate=2008-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples===
In H. G. Wells's ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'', the Martians, who have destroyed everything in their path and apparently triumphed over humanity, are killed by bacteria.&lt;ref name=Greenwood&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Westfahl |editor1-first=Gary |title=The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy: Themes, Works, and Wonders, Volume 1 |date=2005 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |isbn=0313329516 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=SQMQQyIaACYC&amp;pg=PA195 195] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the novel ''[[Lord of the Flies]]'', the rescue of the savage children by a passing navy officer (which author [[William Golding]] called a "gimmick") is viewed by some critics as a ''deus ex machina''. The abrupt ending conveys the terrible fate that would have afflicted the children (in particular Ralph) if the officer had not arrived at that moment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=William Golding's Lord of the Flies |editor-last=Bloom |editor-first=Harold |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j1ZJcFqQ7V8C&amp;pg=PA67&amp;lpg=PA67&amp;dq=Lord+of+the+Flies,+deus+ex+machina |pages=67–68 |chapter=Grief, grief, grief: ''Lord of the Flies'' |first=Lawrence S. |last=Friedman |publisher=Infobase Publishing |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[J. R. R. Tolkien]] referred to the [[Eagle (Middle-earth)|Great Eagles]] that appear in several places in ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' as "a dangerous 'machine'."&lt;ref&gt;J. R. R. Tolkien, letter 210 as quoted [http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Eagles here]&lt;/ref&gt;. This was in a letter refusing permission to a film adapter to have the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] transported by eagles rather than traveling on foot. He felt that the eagles had already been overused as a plot device. For example, in ''[[The Hobbit]]'', the eagles save [[Bilbo Baggins]], [[Gandalf]], and the dwarves from the goblins and wargs, then help turn the tide of the [[Battle of the Five Armies]], and in ''[[The Return of the King]]'' they save [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] from certain death on Mount Doom. In the [[Harvard Lampoon]]'s parody [[Bored of the Rings]], the eagles are referred to as 'Deus ex Machina Airlines.'

''Deus ex machina'' was also used by [[Charles Dickens]] in ''[[Oliver Twist]]'', when in the very peak of climax, Rose Maylie turns out to be the long-lost sister of Agnes, and therefore Oliver's aunt; and she marries her long-time sweetheart Harry, allowing Oliver to live happily with his saviour, Mr. Brownlow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Glossary of Literary Terms |editor-last=Abrams |editor-first=MH |url=http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/glossary-of-literary-terms-m-h-abrams/1100175018?ean=9780495898023 |pages=44–45 |publisher=Harcourt Brace &amp; Company, USA |year=1993 |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The ''deus ex machina'' device has many criticisms attached to it, mainly referring to it as inartistic, too convenient, and overly simplistic. On the other hand, champions of the device say that it opens up ideological and artistic possibilities.&lt;ref name="ghosts"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Breton |first1=Rob |title=Ghosts in the Machina: Plotting in Chartist and Working-Class Fiction |journal=Victorian Studies |date=Summer 2005 |volume=47 |issue=4 |pages=557–575 |doi=10.1353/vic.2006.0003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient criticism===
[[Antiphanes (comic poet)|Antiphanes]] was one of the device's earliest critics. Antiphanes believed that the use of the ''deus ex machina'' was a sign that the playwright was unable to properly manage the complications of his plot. 
{{quote|when they don't know what to say

and have completely given up on the play

just like a finger they lift the machine

and the spectators are satisfied.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Handley |first1=Miriam |title=Shaw's response to the deus ex machina: From the Quintessence of Ibsenism to ''Heartbreak House'' |publisher=Theatre: Ancient &amp; Modern, January 1999 Conference |accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Another critical reference to the device can be found in [[Plato]]'s dialogue ''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'', 425d, though it is made in the context of an argument unrelated to drama.

[[Aristotle]] criticized the device in his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', where he argued that the resolution of a plot must arise internally, following from previous action of the play:&lt;ref&gt;Janko (1987, 20)&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|In the characters too, exactly as in the structure of the incidents, [the poet] ought always to seek what is either necessary or probable, so that it is either necessary or probable that a person of such-and-such a sort say or do things of the same sort, and it is either necessary or probable that this [incident] happen after that one. It is obvious that the solutions of plots too should come about as a result of the plot itself, and not from a contrivance, as in the ''Medea'' and in the passage about sailing home in the ''[[Iliad]]''. A contrivance must be used for matters outside the drama — either previous events which are beyond human knowledge, or later ones that need to be foretold or announced. For we grant that the gods can see everything. There should be nothing improbable in the incidents; otherwise, it should be outside the tragedy, e.g., that in [[Sophocles]]' ''[[Oedipus Rex|Oedipus]]''. |''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' |(1454a33–1454b9) }}

Aristotle praised Euripides, however, for generally ending his plays with bad fortune, which he viewed as correct in tragedy, and somewhat excused the intervention of a deity by suggesting that "astonishment" should be sought in tragic drama:&lt;ref&gt;''Poetics'' 11.5, Penguin (1996, 45).&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Irrationalities should be referred to what people say: That is one solution, and also sometimes that it is not irrational, since it is probable that improbable things will happen.}}

Such a device was referred to by [[Horace]] in his ''[[Ars Poetica (Horace)|Ars Poetica]]'' (lines 191–2), where he instructs poets that they should never resort to a "god from the machine" to resolve their plots "unless a difficulty worthy of a god's unraveling should happen" [''nec deus intersit, nisi dignus uindice nodus inciderit; nec quarta loqui persona laboret''].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/learning/essay/237830?page=3 |title=Ars Poetica by Horace |date=21 September 2017 |website=Poetry Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern criticism===
Following Aristotle, Renaissance critics continued to view the ''deus ex machina'' as an inept plot device, although it continued to be employed by Renaissance dramatists.

Towards the end of the 19th century, [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] criticized [[Euripides]] for making tragedy an optimistic [[genre]] via use of the device, and was highly skeptical of the "Greek cheerfulness", prompting what he viewed as the plays' "blissful delight in life".&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche (2003, 85).&lt;/ref&gt; The ''deus ex machina'' as Nietzsche saw it was symptomatic of [[Socrates|Socratic]] culture, which valued knowledge over [[Apollonian and Dionysian|Dionysiac]] music and ultimately caused the death of tragedy:&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche (2003, 84–86).&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote| But the new non-Dionysiac spirit is most clearly apparent in the ''endings'' of the new dramas. At the end of the old tragedies there was a sense of metaphysical conciliation without which it is impossible to imagine our taking delight in tragedy; perhaps the conciliatory tones from another world echo most purely in ''[[Oedipus at Colonus]]''. Now, once tragedy had lost the genius of music, tragedy in the strictest sense was dead: for where was that metaphysical consolation now to be found? Hence an earthly resolution for tragic dissonance was sought; the hero, having been adequately tormented by fate, won his well-earned reward in a stately marriage and tokens of divine honour. The hero had become a gladiator, granted freedom once he had been satisfactorily flayed and scarred. Metaphysical consolation had been ousted by the ''deus ex machina''.|Friedrich Nietzsche}}
Nietzsche argued that the ''deus ex machina'' creates a false sense of consolation that ought not to be sought in phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche (2003, 80).&lt;/ref&gt; His denigration of the plot device has prevailed in critical opinion.
 
In [[Arthur Woollgar Verrall]]'s publication ''Euripides the Rationalist'' (1895), he surveyed and recorded other late 19th century responses to the device. He recorded that some of the critical responses to the term referred to it as 'burlesque', 'coup de théâtre', and 'catastrophe'. Verrall notes that critics have a dismissive response to authors who deploy the device in their writings. He comes to the conclusion that critics feel that the ''deus ex machina'' is evidence of the author's attempt to ruin the whole of his work and prevent anyone from putting any importance on his work.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

However, other scholars have looked at Euripides' use of ''deus ex machina'' and described its use as an integral part of the plot designed for a specific purpose. Often Euripides' plays would begin with gods, so it is argued that it would be natural for the gods to finish the action. The conflict throughout Euripides' plays would be caused by the meddling of the gods and therefore would make sense to both the playwright and the audience of the time that the gods would resolve all conflict that they began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Abel |first1=D. Herbert |title=Euripides' Deus ex Machina: Fault or Excellence |journal=The Classical Journal |date=December 1954 |volume=50 |issue=3 |pages=127–130 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Half of Euripides' eighteen extant plays end with the use of ''deus ex machina'', therefore it was not simply a device to relieve the playwright of the embarrassment of a confusing plot ending. This device enabled him to bring about a natural and more dignified dramatic and tragic ending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Flickinger |first1=Roy Caston |title=The Greek Theatre and its Drama |date=1926 |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago, Illinois}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other champions of the device believe that it can be a spectacular agent of subversion. It can be used to undercut generic conventions and challenge cultural assumptions and the privileged role of tragedy as a literary/theatrical model.&lt;ref name=ghosts /&gt;

Some 20th-century revisionist criticism suggests that ''deus ex machina'' cannot be viewed in these simplified terms, and contends that the device allows mortals to "probe" their relationship with the divine.&lt;ref name="Rehm 1992, 71"&gt;Rehm (1992, 71).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rush Rehm]] in particular cites examples of Greek tragedy in which the ''deus ex machina'' complicates the lives and attitudes of characters confronted by the deity, while simultaneously bringing the drama home to its audience.&lt;ref name="Rehm 1992, 71" /&gt; Sometimes, the unlikeliness of the ''deus ex machina'' plot device is employed deliberately. For example, comic effect is created in a scene in ''[[Monty Python's Life of Brian]]'' when Brian, who lives in [[Judea]] at the time of [[Christ]], is saved from a high fall by a passing [[ancient astronauts|alien space ship]].&lt;ref&gt;James Berardinelli, James.

A '''disciplinary repository''' (or '''subject repository''') is an online archive containing works or data associated with these works of [[scholar]]s in a particular [[Discipline (academia)|subject area]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://scholarworks.iu.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/2022/166/WP03-01B.html?sequence=1 | title=The Internet and Unrefereed Scholarly Publishing | year=2003 | accessdate=2010-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.arl.org/resources/pubs/br/br226/br226ir.shtml | title=Institutional Repositories: Essential Infrastructure for Scholarship in the Digital Age| year=2003 | accessdate=2010-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disciplinary repositories can accept work from scholars from any institution. A disciplinary repository shares the roles of collecting, disseminating, and archiving work with other repositories, but is focused on a particular subject area. These collections can include academic and [[Academic paper|research papers]].

Disciplinary repositories can acquire their content in many ways. Many rely on author or organization submissions, such as [[Social Science Research Network|SSRN]]. Others such as [[CiteSeerX]] crawl the web for scholar and researcher websites and download publicly available [[academic paper]]s from those sites. [[AgEcon]], established in 1995,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://smartech.gatech.edu/handle/1853/28460 | title=AgEcon Search: An International Disciplinary Repository| year=2009 | accessdate=2010-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; grew as a result of active involvement of academia and societies.

A disciplinary repository generally covers one broad based discipline, with contributors from many different institutions supported by a variety of funders; the repositories themselves are likely to be funded from one or more sources within the subject community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ir.inflibnet.ac.in/dxml/handle/1944/987 | title=Development of Disciplinary Repositories: A Case Study of Open DOAR | year=2010 | accessdate=2010-11-20 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923212301/http://ir.inflibnet.ac.in/dxml/handle/1944/987 | archivedate=2010-09-23 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Deposit of material in a disciplinary repository is sometimes [[Open-access mandate|mandated]] by [[Funding of science|research funders]].

Disciplinary repositories can also act as stores of data related to a particular subject, allowing documents along with data associated with that work to be stored in the repository.

What was believed to be the first public Workshop on Disciplinary Repositories&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://indico.cern.ch/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=132638 | title=Digital Repositories and Field-Specific Digital Libraries: Opportunities and Challenges | year=2011 | accessdate=2011-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; was held on June 16 and 17, 2011, at the ACM Joint Conference on Digital Libraries in [[Ottawa]], Ontario, Canada.

'''''Double Dragon III: The Sacred Stones''''', released in [[Japan]] as {{nihongo|'''''Double Dragon III: The Rosetta Stone'''''|ダブルドラゴンⅢ　ザ・ロゼッタストーン}},  is a side-scrolling [[beat-'em-up]] produced for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] in {{vgy|1991}}. It was the third [[Double Dragon (series)|Double Dragon]] game for the NES,  developed by [[Technos Japan Corp.]] and published in [[North America]] and [[Europe]] by [[Acclaim Entertainment]]. Although loosely based on the similarly titled arcade game  ''[[Double Dragon 3: The Rosetta Stone]]'', it is not a port, but a parallel project that was developed at the same time.&lt;ref name=urabanashi&gt;{{cite web|url=http://star.ap.teacup.com/kunio/|title=Inside stories by Yoshihisa Kishimoto|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
A year after the downfall of the Shadow Warriors, a new enemy threatens Billy and Jimmy Lee, as Marion is kidnapped by a mysterious organization. The only witness to her kidnapping, Brett, dies before he could divulge their leader's true identity. A fortune teller named Hiruko informs the Lee brothers that Marion's kidnappers are searching for the three Sacred Stones of Power that had been scattered around the world and that the only way to rescue her is to procure them before the kidnappers do. After the initial battle in the [[United States]], the Lee brothers embark on a worldwide journey to find the stones, which takes them to [[China]], [[Japan]] and [[Italy]], where they face numerous formidable fighters in each country. The final stage is set in [[Egypt]], where the Lee brothers uncover the truth about Marion's disappearance and come face to face with the true leader of the enemy.

==Gameplay==

''Double Dragon III'' can be played by one or two players simultaneously, with an "A mode" where both players can't harm each other and a "B mode" that allows friendly fire. Like its arcade counterpart, the NES version of ''Double Dragon III'' reverts to having punch and kick buttons as the standard control scheme and the ability to dash by pressing the d-pad left or right twice has been added. The rest of the combat system is a bit closer to the previous NES games, retaining the hair grab move that was removed in the arcade version (although the shoulder throw is gone, as well as the flying knee kick and hyper uppercut from the NES version of ''[[Double Dragon II: The Revenge]]''). New moves in this version include a running jump kick (which can become a triangle jump kick when performed on a wall) and a midair somersault that allows the player to throw enemies by jumping on them. During 2-player mode, when both players are controlling each Lee brother, they can perform a twin cyclone spin kick and a triangle jump kick.

The game discards the traditional lives system from the previous NES installments, as well as the item shops from the arcade version. Instead, the player gains the ability to control two new fighters in addition to the Lee brothers as they progress through the game. These extra fighters join the player's party once they've been defeated as enemy bosses. {{nihongo|Chin Seimei|陳 清明}}, a [[Chinese martial arts]] master, joins at the end of Mission 2, while {{nihongo|Yagyu Ranzou|柳生 乱蔵|Yagyū Ranzō}}, the head of a [[ninja]] clan, appears at the end of Mission 3. By pressing the Select button at any point, the player can access a character selection screen and switch between any of the available fighters. Each fighter has his own fighting techniques, health points and speed, making them suitable for different situations. When the player loses a fighter, he will automatically change to the next available character until the entire party has been defeated. Normally the game ends when the player's entire party has been defeated, but a continue option is available for the final two stages if the player loses once.

In addition to fighting unarmed (or with a sword in Ranzou's case), each fighter has a backup weapon that they can draw at any time from the character selection screen, but can only be used for a limited time. This feature allows the Lee brothers to use [[nunchaku]]s, Chin to wield an iron claw and Ranzou to throw [[shuriken]]s. Weapons can also be obtained by disarming certain enemies, although only the Lee brothers and Chin can arm themselves with enemy weapons (which include a throwing knife, a sai and a beer bottle). An enemy's weapons can be used as long as the original wielder is alive.

==Regional differences==
The English version altered the plot of the game during the translation process, as the Japanese version (titled ''Double Dragon III: The Rosetta Stone'') features a script that's much closer to the arcade game. While the English version involves another rescue mission to save Marion, there's no mention of her in the Japanese script and the Lee brothers are simply searching for the stones in order to become the world's strongest fighters (the final boss is a resurrected [[Cleopatra]] instead of Princess Noiram). Additionally, the death of Brett (whose name was Aldo in the Japanese version) was not connected to the search for the stones, but rather the culprit turns out to be Jim, the boss of the first stage, who is revealed to be the brother of Willy from the original ''Double Dragon'' (a subplot that was eliminated in the English version). Additionally, the purpose of the trip to Italy was to find a clue to solving the riddle of Egypt, rather than train for the big battle; it turns out that the boss of this stage, a shirtless muscle-bound gladiator, had the map of the Pyramid, and rather than revealing in the third stage that Hiruko had the last stone, it is in the Italy stage that she reveals she has it. Lastly, the difficulty is slightly different between the two versions. In the Japanese version, the player starts each stage with more health for their characters and there are less enemies to fight. However, the ending of the Japanese version differs depending on which of the player characters are still alive by the end of the game, whereas the English version always shows the complete ending with all four protagonists no matter what.&lt;ref name=dd3fc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://koti.mbnet.fi/goutetsu/misc/doubledragon3_comparison.htm|title=Double Dragon III script comparison}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''Double Dragon III'' was a major commercial failure, leaving publisher [[Acclaim Entertainment]] with half a million unsold copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=N64 Phobia |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=94|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=May 1997 |page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bimmy==
While Billy's name is spelled correctly throughout most of the game, even in the 1-player version of the opening, the opening of the 2-players mode has his name misspelled as "Bimmy" when both Lee brothers are shown together on the first screen. While this mistake is often attributed to a translation error, the English script is not a direct translation of the Japanese original, as the story underwent changes during the localization.&lt;ref name=dd3fc /&gt; A promotional flyer for the Famicom version features a more direct translation of the original opening text, which spells the name correctly.&lt;ref name=dd3fcflyer&gt;{{cite web|url=http://disk-kun.com/handbills/double-dragon-iii|title=''Double Dragon III: The Rosetta Stone'' Famicom version flyer|website=Disk-kun}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This typo served as the inspiration for the enemy characters "Bimmy 'n' Jammy" in ''[[Double Dragon Neon]]'', deformed clones of the Lee brothers who are described by their introductory tag line as "Mistranslated Mutants".{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

As a reference to this typo, wrestling web-series OSW Review calls [[Suplex#Belly-to-belly suplex|Belly-to-belly suplexes]] ''"Bimmy-to-Jimmy" suplexes''.&lt;ref&gt;http://oswreview.com/dictionary/#bimmy-to-jimmy-suplex&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13610">'''False necessity''', or '''anti-necessitarian social theory''', is a contemporary [[social theory]] that argues for the plasticity of social organizations and their potential to be shaped in new ways.  The theory rejects the assumption that laws of change govern the history of human societies and limit human freedom.&lt;ref name= "fn xvii"&gt;Unger, Robero Mangabeira, ''False necessity: anti-necessitarian social theory in the service of radical democracy: from Politics, a work in constructive social theory'' (London: Verso, 2004), xvii.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a critique of "necessitarian" thought in conventional social theories (like [[liberalism]] or [[Marxism]]) which hold that parts of the social order are necessary or the result of the natural flow of history. The theory rejects the idea that human societies must be organized in a certain way (for example, [[liberal democracy]]) and that human activity will adhere to certain forms (for example if people were only motivated by [[homo economicus|rational self-interest]]).

''False necessity'' uses [[Structuralism|structural analysis]] to understand socio-political arrangements, but discards the tendency to assemble indivisible categories and to create law-like explanations. It aims to liberate human activity from necessary arrangements and limitations, and to open up a world without constraints where the possible becomes actual.&lt;ref&gt;See Unger, Roberto Mangabeira. 1987. Social Theory: Its Situation and Its Task. Politics 2. New York: Verso; Unger, Roberto Mangabeira. 1987. False Necessity: Anti-necessitarian Social Theory in the Service of Radical Democracy. Politics, a Work in Constructive Social Theory. London: Verso; Unger, Roberto Mangabeira. 1987. Plasticity into Power: Comparative-historical Studies of the Institutional Conditions of Economic and Military Success. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Modern social theory contains a tension between the realization of human freedom and the necessity of social rules.&lt;ref&gt;This background is drawn from Ian Shapiro, "Review: Constructing Politics," Political Theory 17, no. 3 (1989): 475-482, Roberto Mangabeira Unger, ''Social Theory: Its Situation and its Task, Politics 2'' (New York: Verso, 1987), Bernard Yack, ''The longing for total revolution: philosophic sources of social discontent from Rousseau to Marx and Nietzsche'' (Princeton, N.J: Princeton University Press, 1986), Bernard Yack, "Review: Toward a Free Marketplace of Social Institutions: Roberto Unger's 'Super-Liberal' Theory of Emancipation," Harvard Law Review 101, no. 8 (June 1, 1988): 1961-1977.
&lt;/ref&gt; [[Classical liberalism#Intellectual sources|Liberal political theorists]] of the seventeenth century, such as [[Hobbes]] and [[John Locke|Locke]], saw the issue as one of sacrificing some individual freedoms in order to gain others. They understood social rules as enabling constraints—necessary impositions that limited activity in some spheres in order to expand it in others. (For example, traffic laws compel us to drive on one side of the road but allow us to travel more freely than if we were constantly assailed by oncoming traffic.) In the socio-political realm, these early liberal thinkers argued that we agree to surrender our freedom for political authority in order to gain greater freedom from a [[state of nature]]. The sovereign authority is a constraint, but it allows freedom from the constraints that other individuals might impose upon us. In this way, rules are always seen as a means of increasing freedom rather than rescinding it.

These early [[Age of Enlightenment#Important intellectuals|Enlightenment thinkers]] opposed existing religious, aristocratic, and absolutist institutions and organizations as the natural state of the world. However, they did not argue for the absolute freedom of the individual outside of any constraining rules. For them, human activity was still subject to certain types of social arrangements that followed a historical necessity.  

Inspired by [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s thesis of [[Immanuel Kant#Idea of freedom|human freedom]], which argued that there is no evidence to disprove our absolute freedom or capacity to resist external domination, thinkers at the end of the eighteenth century addressed how human freedoms were constrained by social institutions. Thinkers like [[Fichte]], [[Schiller]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], and [[Hegel]] argued that those institutions that constrain human freedom and subject the individual to fear and prejudice insult human dignity and deny the individual his autonomy. But they attempted to formulate universal laws, which in turn led to deterministic social and political arrangements. Marx, for example, put humanity at the mercy of historical and institutional necessity. 

The contemporary theory of false necessity attempts to realize this idea in its entirety, and to escape the limitations of liberal and Marxist theories. It aims to realize social plasticity by decoupling human freedom from any necessary social rules or historical trajectory. The theory recognizes the need for social rules, but also affirms the human potential to transcend them. Humanity need not be constrained by any structure.

==Development and content==
The development of the theory is credited to philosopher and politician [[Roberto Mangabeira Unger]]. His main book on the thesis, ''False Necessity: Anti-necessitarian social theory in the service of radical democracy'', was first published in 1987 by Cambridge University Press, and reissued in 2004 by Verso with a new 124 page introduction, and a new appendix, "Five theses on the relation of religion to politics, illustrated by allusions to Brazilian experience."&lt;ref&gt;Unger, Roberto Mangabeira, ''False necessity: anti-necessitarian social theory in the service of radical democracy: from Politics, a work in constructive social theory,'' second edition (London: Verso, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory of ''false necessity'' attempts to understand humans and human history without making ourselves the object of a law-giving fate. It rejects the assumption that certain and necessary laws of organization and change govern the social, political, and economic institutions of human activity and thereby limit human freedom. It holds that the problem with traditional deep structure theory, such as Marxism, is that it couples the distinction of deep structure and routine practice with both indivisible types of social organization, and deep seated constraints and developmental laws. The theory rejects the constraints and focuses on how human behavior is shaped by the deep structures of these institutions, and how they can be remade at will, either in whole or in part. The aim is to rescue social theory and recreate the project of self-affirmation and society.&lt;ref name= "fn xvii"/&gt;

Rather than "enabling constraint" or "universal structure", the theory advocates "structure-denying structures"—that is, structures that enable their own dissolution and remaking. Since these structures normally constrain our activities, this would increase our freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, Hugh. 1987. "Roberto Unger and the Critical Legal Studies Movement." Journal of Law and Society 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources of entrapment and emancipation==
The problem of false necessity arises due to the failure of transformative practice to realize its stated aim. This can take form in three different scenarios:&lt;ref name="Social Theory 5"&gt;Unger, Roberto Mangabeira, ''Social Theory: Its Situation and its Task, Politics 2'' (New York: Verso, 1987), chapter 5.&lt;/ref&gt;
*the ideals fought for (democracy, decentralization, technical coordination, etc.) result in the development of rigid institutions
*an oligarchy effect in which groups and rulers clash at the summit of power and drum up popular support
*the survival effect in which there is a fear of disturbance of contemporary arrangements.

Unger points to mass politics as a means to counter oligarchy and group identity. However, if these forms are only disturbed and not destroyed, democracy is limited and becomes a quarrel about forms of power and seizing advantage. Likewise, enlarged economic rationality provides another source of emancipation by shifting economic and social relations in the ability to constantly innovate and renew.&lt;ref name="Social Theory 5"/&gt;

==The radical project==
The theory of ''false necessity'' develops the idea that the organization of society is made and can be remade—we can rebel against the worlds we have built; we can interrupt our rebellions and establish ourselves in any of those worlds. By emphasizing the disembodiment of institutional and social structures, the theory provides a basis to explain ourselves and our world without using necessitarian thought or predetermined institutional arrangements.&lt;ref name= "fn xvii"/&gt;

At the extreme, the theory of ''false necessity'' criticizes and thus unifies strands of the radical tradition. It frees leftist and liberal ideals from institutional fetishism, and emancipates modernist ideals from structural fetishism. The theory further detaches the radical commitment from utopian claims and provides a theoretical basis for transformative action.&lt;ref&gt;Unger, Roberto Mangabeira, ''Social Theory: Its Situation and its Task, Politics 2'' (New York: Verso, 1987), chapter 7.&lt;/ref&gt; That transformative action, Unger believes, does not have to be a complete overhaul or total revolution, but rather is "a piecemeal but cumulative change in the organization of society".&lt;ref&gt;Unger, Robero Mangabeira, ''False necessity: anti-necessitarian social theory in the service of radical democracy: from Politics, a work in constructive social theory'' (London: Verso, 2004), xix.&lt;/ref&gt; The key to the project, in the words of one critic, "is to complete the rebellion against the naturalistic fallacy (that is, the confusion of accident with essence and contingency with necessity) and to effect an irrevocable emancipation from false necessity".&lt;ref&gt;Hutchinson, Allan C. "Review: A Poetic Champion Composes: Unger (Not) on Ecology and Women." The University of Toronto Law Journal 40, no. 2 (April 1, 1990): 275.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thinkers and opinions==

Contemporary{{when|date=September 2014}} political thinkers and philosophers have developed and advocated the theory of false necessity. [[Roberto Mangabeira Unger]] has employed the theory in developing social, political, and economic alternatives,&lt;ref&gt;Unger, Roberto Mangabeira. ''Democracy realized: the progressive alternative.'' London: Verso, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Unger, Roberto Mangabeira. ''Free trade reimagined: the world division of labor and the method of economics.'' Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Unger, Roberto Mangabeira. ''The future of American progressivism: an initiative for political and economic reform.'' Boston: Beacon Press, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Unger, Roberto Mangabeira. ''The left alternative.'' London: Verso, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in his political activism and appointments in Brazilian politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Press|first=Eyal|title=The Passion of Roberto Unger|url=http://linguafranca.mirror.theinfo.org/9903/unger.html|publisher=Lingua Franca|accessdate=4 July 2011|date=March 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Barrionuevo | first = Alexei | title = 'Minister of Ideas' Tries to Put Brazil's Future in Focus | publisher = [[The New York Times]] | date = 2008-02-02 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/02/world/americas/02unger.html?_r=2&amp;ref=world&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin | accessdate = 2008-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Rorty]] compared the theory's move towards greater liberalism with [[Jürgen Habermas]], and called it a powerful alternative to the postmodern "[[School of Resentment]]".&lt;ref&gt;Rorty, Richard. "Unger, Castoriadis, and the Romance of a National Future." ''Northwestern University Law Review'' 82 (1988 1987).&lt;/ref&gt; Other thinkers have said the theory is "a challenge that the social disciplines can ignore only at their peril".&lt;ref&gt;Trubek, David M. "Radical Theory and Programmatic Thought." ''American Journal of Sociology'' 95, no. 2 (1989): 447.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bernard Yack]] wrote that it contributed to "a new left Kantian approach to the problem of realizing human freedom in our social institutions".&lt;ref&gt;Yack, Bernard. "Review: Toward a Free Marketplace of Social Institutions: Roberto Unger's 'Super-Liberal' Theory of Emancipation." ''Harvard Law Review'' 101, no. 8 (June 1, 1988): 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:DionisioGate.jpg|thumb|Torii Gate by Dionicio Rodriguez at [[Brackenridge Park]], [[San Antonio]], Texas.]]

'''Faux bois''' (from the French for ''false wood'') refers to the artistic imitation of wood or wood grains in various media. The craft has roots in the [[Renaissance]] with [[trompe-l'œil]]. It was probably first crafted with concrete using an iron [[Armature (sculpture)|armature]] by garden craftsmen in France called "[[rocailleur]]s" using common iron materials: rods, barrel bands, and [[chicken wire]]. 

Early examples of the craft survive at [[Parc des Buttes-Chaumont]] opened for an exposition in Paris in 1867. In 1873, the inventor of [[ferrocement]], [[Joseph Monier]] expanded his patents to include bridges. He designed the first bridge of [[reinforced concrete]], crossing the [[moat]] at the Chateau Chazelet, in France. It was sculpted to resemble timbers and logs. &lt;ref name="light"&gt;Light, Patsy Pittman (2005). ''Capturing Nature: the Cement Sculpture of Dionicio Rodriguez''. Texas A&amp;M University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ferrocement faux bois uses a combination of concrete, [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]] and [[grout]] applied to a steel frame or armature to sculpt lifelike representations of wooden objects. Final sculpting can be done while the mixture is wet, in a putty state, or slightly stiff.  Techniques vary among artisans.  Most popular in the late 19th century through the 1940s, ferrocement faux bois has largely disappeared with the passing of those most expert in its practice. What few objects remain from that peak period (mostly in the form of garden art, such as planters and birdbaths) are now highly prized by collectors.

In Mexico and Texas, this style is sometimes known as "el trabajo rústico" (''the rustic work''). It is often characterized by a more realistic look in both composition and coloring, as well as a more finely detailed finish than comparable European work. One highly regarded artist who worked in this style was [[Dionicio Rodriguez]], a Mexican who relocated to Texas in the early 1920s. Although Rodriguez is not widely known, his large-scale faux bois installations have been listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name="light" /&gt; Dionicio's great-nephew is one of the handful of artists still creating faux bois today.

{{Buddhism}}
'''Greco-Buddhism''', or '''Graeco-Buddhism''', is the cultural [[syncretism]] between [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic culture]] and [[Buddhism]], which developed between the 4th century BC and the 5th century AD in [[Bactria]] and the [[Indian subcontinent]]. It was a cultural consequence of a long chain of interactions begun by Greek forays into India from the time of [[Alexander the Great]]. The [[ancient Macedonians|Macedonian]] [[satraps]] were then conquered by the [[Mauryan Empire]], under the reign of [[Chandragupta Maurya]]. The Mauryan [[Emperor Ashoka]] would convert to Buddhism and spread the religious philosophy throughout his domain, as recorded in the [[Edicts of Ashoka]]. Following the collapse of the Mauryan Empire, Greco-Buddhism continued to flourish under the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]], [[Indo-Greek Kingdoms]], and [[Kushan Empire]]. Buddhism was adopted in Central and Northeastern [[Asia]] from the 1st century AD, ultimately spreading to [[China]], [[Korea]], [[Japan]], [[Siberia]], and [[Vietnam]].

{{See also|History of Buddhism}}
The introduction of [[Hellenistic Greece]] started when [[Alexander the Great]] conquered the [[Achaemenid Empire]] and further regions of [[Central Asia]] in 334 BC. Alexander would then venture into [[Punjab]] (land of five rivers), which was conquered by [[Darius the Great]] before him. Alexander crossed the [[Indus River|Indus]] and [[Jhelum River]] when defeating Porus and appointing him as a satrap following the [[Battle of the Hydaspes]]. Alexander's army would mutiny and retreat along the [[Beas River]] when confronted by the [[Nanda Empire]], thus wouldn't conquer Punjab entirely.

Alexander founded several cities in his new territories in the areas of the [[Amu Darya]] and [[Bactria]], and Greek settlements further extended to the [[Khyber Pass]], [[Gandhara]] (see [[Taxila (modern)|Taxila]]), and the [[Punjab]]. Following Alexander's death on June 10, 323&amp;nbsp;BC, the [[Diadochi]] or "successors" founded their own kingdoms. General [[Seleucus I Nicator|Seleucus]] set up the [[Seleucid Empire]] in [[Anatolia]] and [[Central Asia]] and extended as far as India.

The [[Mauryan Empire]], founded by [[Chandragupta Maurya]], would first [[Conquest of the Nanda Empire|conquer the Nanda Empire]]. Chandragupta would then defeat the Seleucid Empire during the [[Seleucid-Mauryan War]]. This resulted in the transfer of the Macedonian satraps in the [[Indus Valley]] and [[Gandhara]] to the Mauryan Empire. Furthermore, a marriage alliance was enacted which granted Seleucus's daughter as Chandragupta's wife for diplomatic relations. The conflict additionally led to the transfer of 500 war elephants to the Seleucid Empire from the Mauryan Empire, presumably as expenses of lives lost and damages sustained.

The Mauryan Emperor Ashoka established the [[List of largest empires in India|largest Indian empire]]. Following the destructive [[Kalinga War]], Ashoka converted to Buddhism. Abandoning an expansionist agenda, Ashoka would adopt humanitarian reformation in place.&lt;ref&gt;The Contribution of the Emperor Asoka Maurya to the Development of the Humanitarian Ideal in Warfare
30-04-1995 Article, International Review of the Red Cross, No. 305, by Gerald Draper&lt;/ref&gt; As ascribed in the [[Edicts of Ashoka]], the Emperor spread [[Dharma]] as Buddhism throughout his empire. Ashoka claims to have converted many, including the Greek populations within his realm to Buddhism:
{{quote|Here in the king's domain among the Greeks, the [[Kambojas]], the Nabhakas, the Nabhapamkits, the Bhojas, the Pitinikas, the Andhras and the Palidas, everywhere people are following Beloved-of-the-Gods' instructions in [[Dharma]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;''[[Edicts of Ashoka|Rock Edict Nb13]]'' (S. Dhammika)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The decline and overthrow of the Mauryans by the [[Shunga Empire]], and of the revolt of [[Bactria]] in the Seleucid Empire led to the formation of the [[Greco-Bactrian]] Kingdom (250–125&amp;nbsp;BC). The Greco-Bactrians were followed by the [[Indo-Greek Kingdom]] (180&amp;nbsp;BC&amp;nbsp;– AD&amp;nbsp;10). Even though the region was conquered by the [[Indo-Scythians]] and the [[Kushan Empire]] (1st–3rd centuries AD), Buddhism continued to thrive.

[[Buddhism in India]] was a major religion for centuries until a major Hindu revival from around the 5th century, with remaining strongholds such as [[Bengal]] largely ended during the [[Islamic invasions of India]].

==Cultural interaction==
{{see also|Hellenistic influence on Indian art}}
The length of the Greek presence in Central Asia and northern India provided opportunities for interaction, not only on the artistic, but also on the religious plane.

===Alexander the Great in Bactria and India (331–325&amp;nbsp;BC)===
[[File:Alexander victory coin Babylon silver c 322 BCE.jpg|thumb|upright|"Victory coin" of [[Alexander the Great]], minted in [[Babylon]] {{circa|322&amp;nbsp;BC}}, following his campaigns in [[India]].&lt;br/&gt;'''Obverse''': Alexander being crowned by [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]].&lt;br/&gt;'''Reverse''': Alexander attacking [[King Porus]] on his elephant.&lt;br/&gt;Silver. [[British Museum]].]]
When Alexander invaded [[Bactria]] and Gandhara, these areas may already have been under [[Śramaṇa|Sramanic]] influence, likely Buddhist and [[Jainism|Jain]]. According to a legend preserved in the [[Pali Canon]], two [[merchant]] brothers from [[Kamsabhoga]] in Bactria, Tapassu and Bhallika, visited Gautama Buddha and became his disciples. The legend states that they then returned home and spread the Buddha's teaching.&lt;ref&gt;Foltz, ''Religions of the Silk Road'', p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

In 326 BC, Alexander conquered the Northern region of India. King Ambhi of Taxila, known as [[Taxiles]], surrendered his city, a notable Buddhist center, to Alexander. Alexander fought an epic battle against [[King Porus]] of [[Pauravas]] in the Punjab, at the Battle of the Hydaspes in 326 BC.

===Mauryan empire (322–183&amp;nbsp;BC)===
{{See also|Greco-Buddhist monasticism}}
The Indian emperor [[Chandragupta Maurya]], founder of the [[Maurya Empire]], reconquered around 322&amp;nbsp;BC the northwest Indian territory that had been lost to [[Alexander the Great]]. However, contacts were kept with his Greco-Iranian neighbours in the [[Seleucid Empire]]. Emperor [[Seleucus I Nicator]] came to a marital agreement as part of a peace treaty,&lt;ref&gt;"The whole region from Phrygia to the Indus was subject to Seleucus. He crossed the Indus and waged war with Sandrocottus [Chandragupta], king of the Indians, who dwelt on the banks of that stream, until they came to an understanding with each other and contracted a marriage relationship. Some of these exploits were performed before the death of Antigonus and some afterward." [[Appian]] ''History of Rome'', The Syrian Wars [http://www.livius.org/ap-ark/appian/appian_syriaca_11.html 55]&lt;/ref&gt; and several Greeks, such as the historian [[Megasthenes]], resided at the Mauryan court.

[[File:Pataliputra Palace capital by L A Waddell 1895.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Hellenistic]] [[Pataliputra capital]], discovered in [[Pataliputra]], capital of the [[Maurya Empire]], dated to the 3rd century BC.]]
Chandragupta's grandson Ashoka embraced the Buddhist faith and became a great proselytizer in the line of the traditional Pali canon of Theravada Buddhism, insisting on non-violence to humans and animals ([[ahimsa]]), and general precepts regulating the life of lay people.

According to the [[Edicts of Ashoka]], set in stone, some of them written in Greek&lt;ref&gt;For an English translation of the Greek edicts: {{cite book|title=Religions and Trade: Religious Formation, Transformation and Cross-Cultural Exchange between East and West|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AXdfAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA65|date=2 December 2013|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-25530-2|pages=65–}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some in [[Aramaic alphabet|Aramaic]], the official language of the [[Achaemenids]], he sent Buddhist emissaries to the Greek lands in Asia and as far as the Mediterranean. The edicts name each of the rulers of the [[Hellenistic period]]:
{{quote|The conquest by [[Dharma]] has been won here, on the borders, and even six hundred yojanas [4,000 miles] away, where the Greek king [[Antiochus II Theos|Antiochos]] (Antiyoga) rules, and beyond there where the four kings named [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus|Ptolemy]] (Turamaya), [[Antigonus II Gonatas|Antigonos]] (Antikini), [[Magas of Cyrene|Magas]] (Maka) and [[Alexander II of Epirus|Alexander]] (Alikasu[n]dara) rule, likewise in the south among the [[Chola dynasty|Cholas]], the [[Pandyan dynasty|Pandyas]], and as far as [[Tamraparni]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Edicts of Ashoka|Rock Edict Nb.13]], Full text of the Edicts of Ashoka. [http://www.cs.colostate.edu/~malaiya/ashoka.html See Rock Edict 13] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131028175927/http://www.cs.colostate.edu/~malaiya/ashoka.html |date=2013-10-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Ashoka also claims he converted to Buddhism Greek populations within his realm:
{{quote|Here in the king's domain among the Greeks, the [[Kambojas]], the Nabhakas, the Nabhapamkits, the Bhojas, the Pitinikas, the Andhras and the Palidas, everywhere people are following Beloved-of-the-Gods' instructions in [[Dharma]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;}}
Finally, some of the emissaries of Ashoka, such as the famous [[Dharmaraksita]], are described in [[Pali]] sources as leading Greek ("[[Yona]]") Buddhist monks active in Buddhist proselytism (the [[Mahavamsa]], XII&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020052522/http://lakdiva.org/mahavamsa/chap012.html|title=Chapter XII|date=20 October 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;), founding the eponymous [[Dharmaguptaka]] school of Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.congress-on-buddhist-women.org/index.php?id=62|title=Abstract Sujato: Sects &amp; Sectarianism|website=www.congress-on-buddhist-women.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greek presence in Bactria (325–125&amp;nbsp;BC)===
{{Main|Greco-Bactrian Kingdom}}
[[File:AiKhanoumAndIndia.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom|Greco-Bactrian]] city of [[Ai-Khanoum]] ({{circa|300}}–145&amp;nbsp;BC) was located at the doorstep of [[India]].]]
Alexander had established in Bactria several cities ([[Ai-Khanoum]], [[Bagram]]) and an administration that were to last more than two centuries under the [[Seleucid Empire]] and the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]], all the time in direct contact with Indian territory. The Greeks sent ambassadors to the court of the [[Maurya Empire]], such as the historian [[Megasthenes]] under [[Chandragupta Maurya]], and later [[Deimachus]] under his son [[Bindusara]], who reported extensively on the civilization of the Indians. Megasthenes sent detailed reports on Indian religions, which were circulated and quoted throughout the Classical world for centuries:&lt;ref&gt;Surviving fragments of Megasthenes:[https://web.archive.org/web/20081210080315/http://www.mssu.edu/projectsouthasia/history/primarydocs/Foreign_Views/GreekRoman/Megasthenes-Indika.htm Full text]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Megasthenes makes a different division of the philosophers, saying that they are of two kinds, one of which he calls the [[Brahman|Brachmanes]], and the other the [[Sramana|Sarmanes]]..." [[Strabo]] XV. 1. 58-60&lt;ref name="Strabo XV.1"/&gt;}}
The Greco-Bactrians maintained a strong Hellenistic culture at the door of India during the rule of the Maurya Empire in India, as exemplified by the archaeological site of [[Ai-Khanoum]]. When the Maurya Empire was toppled by the [[Shunga Empire]] around 180 BC, the Greco-Bactrians expanded into India, where they established the [[Indo-Greek Kingdom]], under which Buddhism was able to flourish.

[[File:Greek Gods and Dharmachakra.jpg|thumb|350px|Greek Gods and the "Wheel of the Law" or [[Dharmachakra]]: '''Left:''' [[Zeus]] holding [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]], who hands a victory [[wreath]] over a Dharmachakra (coin of [[Menander II]]).

{{Main|Indo-Greek Kingdom}}
The Greco-Bactrians conquered parts of [[North India]] from 180&amp;nbsp;BC, whence they are known as the Indo-Greeks. They controlled various areas of the northern Indian territory until AD&amp;nbsp;10.

Buddhism prospered under the Indo-Greek kings, and it has been suggested that their invasion of India was intended to protect the Buddhist faith from the religious persecutions of the [[Shunga Empire|Shungas]] (185–73&amp;nbsp;BC), who had overthrown the Mauryans. [[Zarmanochegas]] was a śramana (possibly, but not necessarily a Buddhist) who, according to ancient historians such as [[Strabo]], [[Cassius Dio]] and [[Nicolaus of Damascus]] traveled to [[Antioch]] and [[Athens]] while [[Augustus]] (died AD&amp;nbsp;14) was ruling the [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref name="perseus.tufts.edu"&gt;Strabo, xv, 1, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0239&amp;layout=&amp;loc=15.1.73 on the immolation of the Sramana in Athens (Paragraph 73)].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="liv, 9"&gt;[[Dio Cassius]], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/54*.html#9 liv, 9].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Coinage====
The coins of the Indo-Greek king [[Menander I]] (reigned 160–135&amp;nbsp;BC), found from [[Afghanistan]] to central India, bear the inscription "Saviour King Menander" in Greek on the front. Several Indo-Greek kings after Menander, such as [[Zoilos I]], [[Strato I]], [[Heliokles II]], [[Theophilos (king)|Theophilos]], [[Peukolaos]], [[Menander II]] and [[Archebius]] display on their coins the title "Maharajasa Dharmika" (lit. "King of the Dharma") in [[Prakrit]] written in [[Kharoshthi]].

Some of the coins of Menander I and [[Menander II]] incorporate the Buddhist symbol of the eight-spoked wheel, associated with the Greek symbols of victory, either the palm of victory, or the victory wreath handed over by the goddess [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]]. According to the [[Milinda Panha|Milinda Pañha]], at the end of his reign Menander I became a Buddhist [[arhat]],&lt;ref&gt;Extract of the [[Milinda Panha]]: "And afterwards, taking delight in the wisdom of the Elder, he handed over his kingdom to his son, and abandoning the household life for the houseless state, grew great in insight, and himself attained to [[Arhat|Arahatship]]!" ([[Milinda Panha|The Questions of King Milinda]], Translation by [[Thomas William Rhys Davids|T. W. Rhys Davids]], 1890)&lt;/ref&gt; a fact also echoed by [[Plutarch]], who explains that his relics were shared and enshrined.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch on Menander: "But when one Menander, who had reigned graciously over the Bactrians, died afterwards in the camp, the cities indeed by common consent celebrated his funerals; but coming to a contest about his relics, they were difficultly at last brought to this agreement, that his ashes being distributed, everyone should carry away an equal share, and they should all erect monuments to him." (Plutarch, "Political Precepts" Praec. reip. ger. 28, 6) p147–148 [https://web.archive.org/web/20060220090138/http://oll.libertyfund.org/Texts/Plutarch0206/Morals/0062-05_Bk.pdf Full text]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MenanderChakra.jpg|thumb|250px|left|A coin of [[Menander I]] (r.160–135 BC) with a [[dharmacakra]] and a palm.]]

The ubiquitous symbol of the elephant in Indo-Greek coinage may also have been associated with Buddhism, as suggested by the parallel between coins of [[Antialcidas]] and [[Menander II]], where the elephant in the coins of Antialcidas holds the same relationship to Zeus and Nike as the Buddhist wheel on the coins of Menander II. When the [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] [[Indo-Parthian Kingdom]] invaded North India in the 1st century AD, they adopted a large part of the symbolism of Indo-Greek coinage, but refrained from ever using the elephant, suggesting that its meaning was not merely geographical.

Finally, after the reign of Menander I, several Indo-Greek rulers, such as [[Amyntas Nikator]], [[Nicias (Indo-Greek king)|Nicias]], [[Peukolaos]], [[Hermaeus]], [[Hippostratos]] and [[Menander II]], depicted themselves or their Greek deities forming with the right hand a benediction gesture identical to the Buddhist vitarka [[mudra]] (thumb and index joined together, with other fingers extended), which in Buddhism signifies the transmission of Buddha's teaching.

====Cities====
According to [[Ptolemy]], Greek cities were founded by the Greco-Bactrians in northern [[India]]. Menander established his capital in [[Sagala]] (modern [[Sialkot]], [[Punjab, Pakistan]]) one of the centers of the blossoming [[Buddhist culture]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Milinda Panha]], Chap. I&lt;/ref&gt; A large Greek city built by [[Demetrius I of Bactria|Demetrius]] and rebuilt by Menander has been excavated at the archaeological site of [[Sirkap]] near [[Taxila (modern)|Taxila]], where Buddhist [[stupa]]s were standing side-by-side with [[Hindu]] and [[Ancient Greek temple|Greek temples]], indicating religious tolerance and syncretism.

====Scriptures====
Evidence of direct religious interaction between Greek and Buddhist thought during the period include the ''[[Milinda Pañha]]'' or "Questions of Menander", a Pali-language discourse in the [[Platonism|Platonic style]] held between Menander I and the Buddhist monk [[Nagasena]].

[[File:Ruvanvelisaya Dagoba.jpg|thumb|According to the ''[[Mahavamsa]]'', the [[Ruwanwelisaya]] in [[Anuradhapura]], [[Sri Lanka]], was dedicated by a 30,000-strong [[Yona]] delegation from [[Alexandria on the Caucasus]] around 130&amp;nbsp;BC.]]
The ''[[Mahavamsa]]'', chapter 29, records that during Menander's reign, a Greek ''thera'' (elder monk) named ''[[Mahadharmaraksita]]'' led 30,000 Buddhist monks from "the Greek city of Alexandria" (possibly [[Alexandria on the Caucasus]], around {{convert|150|km}} north of today's [[Kabul]] in Afghanistan), to [[Sri Lanka]] for the dedication of a stupa, indicating that Buddhism flourished in Menander's territory and that Greeks took a very active part in it.&lt;ref name="McEvilley2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas  McEvilley|title=The Shape of Ancient Thought: Comparative Studies in Greek and Indian Philosophies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gbjelOMYyN8C&amp;pg=PT558|date=7 February 2012|publisher=Constable &amp; Robinson|isbn=978-1-58115-933-2|pages=558–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several Buddhist dedications by Greeks in India are recorded, such as that of the Greek [[meridarch]] (civil governor of a province) named [[Theodorus (meridarch)|Theodorus]], describing in Kharosthi how he enshrined [[śarīra|relics of the Buddha]]. The inscriptions were found on a vase inside a stupa, dated to the reign of Menander or one of his successors in the 1st century BC.&lt;ref name="Tarn2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Tarn|first=William Woodthorpe|title=The Greeks in Bactria and India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-HeJS3nE9cAC|date=24 June 2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-108-00941-6|page=391|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Buddhist tradition recognizes Menander as one of the great benefactors of the faith, together with Ashoka and [[Kanishka the Great]].

Buddhist manuscripts in cursive Greek have been found in Afghanistan, praising various Buddhas and including mentions of the [[Mahayana]] figure of "[[Avalokiteśvara|Lokesvara]]raja Buddha" ({{lang|grc|λωγοασφαροραζοβοδδο}}). These manuscripts have been dated later than the 2nd century AD.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Sims-Williams, "A Bactrian Buddhist Manuscript"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kushan empire (1st–3rd century AD)===
{{Main|Kushan Empire}}
The [[Kushan Empire]], one of the five tribes of the [[Yuezhi]], settled in [[Bactria]] around 125&amp;nbsp;BC, displacing the Greco-Bactrians and invading the northern parts of Pakistan and India from around AD&amp;nbsp;1. By that time they had already been in contact with Greek culture and the Indo-Greek kingdoms for more than a century. They used the Greek script to write their language, as exemplified by their [[coin]]s and their adoption of the [[Greek alphabet]].

[[File:Indo-GreekBanquet.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Hellenistic culture in the Indian subcontinent: Greek clothes, [[amphora]]s, wine and music. Detail from [[Chakhil-i-Ghoundi Stupa]], [[Hadda, Afghanistan|Hadda]], [[Gandhara]], 1st century AD.]]
The Kushan King Kanishka, who honored Zoroastrian, Greek and Brahmanic deities as well as the Buddha and was famous for his religious syncretism, convened the [[Fourth Buddhist council]] around 100 in [[Kashmir]] in order to redact the [[Sarvastivada#Canon|Sarvastivadin canon]]. Some of Kanishka's coins bear the earliest representations of the Buddha on a coin (around 120), in Hellenistic style and with the word "Boddo" in Greek script.

Kanishka also had the original Gandhari Prakrit [[Mahāyāna sūtras]] translated into [[Sanskrit]], "a turning point in the evolution of the Buddhist literary canon"&lt;ref&gt;Foltz, ''Religions of the Silk Road'', p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Kanishka casket]], dated to the first year of Kanishka's reign in 127, was signed by a Greek artist named ''Agesilas'', who oversaw work at Kanishka's stupas ([[cetiya]]), confirming the direct involvement of Greeks with Buddhist realizations at such a late date.

==Philosophical influences==
Several philosophers, including [[Pyrrho]], [[Anaxarchus]] and [[Onesicritus]], are said to have accompanied Alexander in his eastern campaigns. During the 18 months they were in India, they were able to interact with Indian ascetics, generally described as [[Gymnosophists]] ("naked philosophers").

Pyrrho returned to Greece and founded [[Pyrrhonism]], the first Western school of [[skepticism]]. The Greek biographer [[Diogenes Laërtius]] explained that Pyrrho's equanimity and detachment from the world were acquired in India.&lt;ref&gt;"He would withdraw from the world and live in solitude, rarely showing himself to his relatives; this is because he had heard an Indian reproach [[Anaxarchus]], telling him that he would never be able to teach others what is good while he himself danced attendance on kings in their court. He would maintain the same composure at all times." (Diogenes Laertius, IX.63 on Pyrrhon)&lt;/ref&gt; Pyrrho was directly influenced by Buddhism in developing his philosophy, which is based on Pyrrho's interpretation of the Buddhist [[Three marks of existence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Beckwith |first=Christopher I. |title=Greek Buddha: Pyrrho's Encounter with Early Buddhism in Central Asia |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |year=2015 |page=28 |url=http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s10500.pdf |ISBN=9781400866328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another of these philosophers, Onesicritus, a [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynic]], is said by [[Strabo]] to have learnt in India the following precepts: "That nothing that happens to a man is bad or good, opinions being merely dreams. ... That the best philosophy [is] that which liberates the mind from [both] pleasure and grief".&lt;ref name="Strabo XV.1"&gt;Strabo, XV.I.65: {{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0239&amp;query=head%3D%23119 |title=Strabo XV.1 |publisher=Perseus.tufts.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher [[Hegesias of Cyrene]], from the city of [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]] where [[Magas of Cyrene]] ruled, is thought by some to have been influenced by the teachings of Ashoka's Buddhist missionaries.&lt;ref&gt;"The philosopher Hegesias of Cyrene (nicknamed ''Peisithanatos'', "The advocate of death") was a contemporary of Magas and was probably influenced by the teachings of the Buddhist missionaries to Cyrene and Alexandria. His influence was such that he was ultimately prohibited from teaching." Jean-Marie Lafont, [[Inalco]] in "Les Dossiers d'Archéologie", No254, p.78&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artistic influences==
{{Main|Greco-Buddhist art}}
Numerous works of [[Greco-Buddhist art]] display the intermixing of Greek and Buddhist influences in such creation centers as [[Gandhara]]. The subject matter of Gandharan art was definitely Buddhist, while most motifs were of [[Western Asia]]tic or Hellenistic origin.

===Anthropomorphic representation of the Buddha===
[[File:MaraAssault.jpg|thumb|upright|An aniconic representation of [[Mara (demon)|Mara]]'s assault on the Buddha, 2nd century AD, [[Amaravathi village, Guntur district]], [[India]].]]
Although there is still some debate, the first [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] representations of the Buddha himself are often considered a result of the Greco-Buddhist interaction. Before this innovation, Buddhist art was "[[aniconism|aniconic]]": the Buddha was only represented through his symbols (an empty throne, the [[Bodhi Tree]], [[Buddha footprint]]s, the [[Dharmachakra]]).

This reluctance towards anthropomorphic representations of the Buddha, and the sophisticated development of aniconic symbols to avoid it (even in narrative scenes where other human figures would appear), seem to be connected to one of the Buddha's sayings reported in the ''[[Digha Nikaya]]'' that discouraged representations of himself after the extinction of his body.&lt;ref&gt;"Due to the statement of the Master in the ''Dighanikaya'' disfavouring his representation in human form after the extinction of body, reluctance prevailed for some time". Also "''Hinayanis'' opposed image worship of the Master due to canonical restrictions".   R.C. Sharma, in "The Art of Mathura, India", Tokyo National Museum 2002, p.11&lt;/ref&gt;

Probably not feeling bound by these restrictions, and because of "their cult of form, the Greeks were the first to attempt a sculptural representation of the Buddha".&lt;ref&gt;Linssen, "[[Zen]] Living"&lt;/ref&gt; {{page needed|date=June 2014}} In many parts of the Ancient World, the Greeks did develop [[syncretic]] divinities, that could become a common religious focus for populations with different traditions: a well-known example is [[Serapis]], introduced by [[Ptolemy I Soter]] in [[Egypt]], who combined aspects of Greek and Egyptian Gods. In India as well, it was only natural for the Greeks to create a single common divinity by combining the image of a Greek [[god-king]] ([[Apollo]], or possibly the deified founder of the [[Indo-Greek Kingdom]], [[Demetrius I of Bactria]]), with the traditional [[physical characteristics of the Buddha]].

}}
Many of the stylistic elements in the representations of the Buddha point to Greek influence: [[himation]], the [[contrapposto]] stance of the upright figures, such as the 1st–2nd century Gandhara standing Buddhas, the stylized curly hair and [[ushnisha]] apparently derived from the style of the [[Apollo Belvedere]] (330&amp;nbsp;BC) and the measured quality of the faces, all rendered with strong artistic [[Realism (arts)|realism]]. A large quantity of [[sculpture]]s combining Buddhist and purely Hellenistic styles and [[iconography]] were excavated at the modern site of [[Hadda, Afghanistan]]. The curly hair of Buddha is described in the famous list of the [[physical characteristics of the Buddha]] in the Buddhist sutras. The hair with curls turning to the right is first described in the [[Pāli canon]]; we find the same description in the ''[[Prajnaparamita|Dāsāṣṭasāhasrikā prajñāpāramitā]]''.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Greek artists were most probably the authors of these early representations of the Buddha, in particular the standing statues, which display "a realistic treatment of the folds and on some even a hint of modelled volume that characterizes the best Greek work. This is Classical or Hellenistic Greek, not archaizing Greek transmitted by Persia or Bactria, nor distinctively [[Ancient Rome|Roman]]."&lt;ref&gt;Boardman{{full citation needed|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greek stylistic influence on the representation of the Buddha, through its idealistic realism, also permitted a very accessible, understandable and attractive visualization of the ultimate state of [[Bodhi|enlightenment]] described by Buddhism, allowing it to reach a wider audience:
{{quote|One of the distinguishing features of the Gandharan school of art that emerged in north-west India is that it has been clearly influenced by the naturalism of the Classical Greek style. Thus, while these images still convey the inner peace that results from putting the Buddha's doctrine into practice, they also give us an impression of people who walked and talked, etc. and slept much as we do. I feel this is very important. These figures are inspiring because they do not only depict the goal, but also the sense that people like us can achieve it if we try.|[[14th Dalai Lama]]&lt;ref&gt;[[14th Dalai Lama]], foreword to "Echoes of Alexander the Great", 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

During the following centuries, this anthropomorphic representation of the Buddha defined the canon of Buddhist art, but progressively evolved to incorporate more Indian and Asian elements.

===Hellenized Buddhist pantheon===

[[File:Coin of Kanishka I.jpg|thumb|left|A Buddhist coin of [[Kanishka I]], with legend ΒΟΔΔΟ "Boddo" (=the [[Buddha]]) in Greek script on the reverse.]]
Several other Buddhist deities may have been influenced by Greek gods. For example, [[Heracles]] with a lion-skin, the protector deity of [[Demetrius I of Bactria]], "served as an artistic model for [[Vajrapani]], a protector of the Buddha"&lt;ref&gt;Foltz, ''Religions of the Silk Road'', p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; (See&lt;ref&gt;Images of the Herakles-influenced Vajrapani: [https://web.archive.org/web/20131216205740/http://www.exoticindiaart.com/artimages/BuddhaImage/greece_sm.jpg Image 1], [http://faculty.maxwell.syr.edu/gaddis/HST210/Oct21/Heracles-Vajrapani.jpg Image 2] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040313155937/http://faculty.maxwell.syr.edu/gaddis/HST210/Oct21/Heracles-Vajrapani.jpg |date=2004-03-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;). In [[Japan]], this expression further translated into the wrath-filled and muscular [[Nio|Niō]] guardian gods of the Buddha, standing today at the entrance of many Buddhist temples.

According to Katsumi Tanabe, professor at Chūō University, Japan, besides Vajrapani, Greek influence also appears in several other gods of the Mahayana pantheon such as the Japanese [[Fūjin]], inspired from the Greek divinity [[Anemoi#Boreas|Boreas]] through the Greco-Buddhist [[Wardo]], or the mother deity [[Hariti]] inspired by [[Tyche]].&lt;ref&gt;Katsumi Tanabe, ''Alexander the Great: East-West Cultural Contact from Greece to Japan'' (Tokyo: NHK Puromōshon and Tokyo National Museum, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, forms such as [[garland]]-bearing [[cherub]]s, [[vine]] [[scroll]]s, and such semi-human creatures as the [[centaur]] and [[Triton (mythology)|triton]], are part of the repertory of Hellenistic art introduced by Greco-Roman artists in the service of the Kushan court.

===Gandharan proselytism in the East===

[[File:Central Asian Buddhist Monks.jpeg|thumb|upright|left|Blue-eyed [[Buddhism in Central Asia|Central Asia]]n monk teaching East-Asian monk. A fresco from the  [[Bezeklik Thousand Buddha Caves]], dated to the 9th or 10th century ([[Kara-Khoja Kingdom]]).]]

Greek monks played a direct role in the upper hierarchy of Buddhism, and in its early dissemination. During the rule (165–135&amp;nbsp;BC) of the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom|Greco-Bactrian]] King [[Menander I]] ([[Pāli|Pali]]: "Milinda"),  [[Mahadharmaraksita]] (literally translated as 'Great Teacher/Preserver of the Dharma') was "a Greek ([[Pāli|Pali]]: [[Yona]], lit. [[Ionia]]n) Buddhist head monk," according to the [[Mahavamsa]] (Chap. XXIX), who led 30,000 Buddhist monks from "the Greek city of Alasandra" ([[Alexandria of the Caucasus]], around 150&amp;nbsp;km north of today's [[Kabul]] in [[Afghanistan]]), to Sri Lanka for the dedication of the [[Ruwanwelisaya|Great Stupa]] in [[Anuradhapura]]. [[Dharmaraksita]] ([[Sanskrit]]), or Dhammarakkhita ([[Pāli|Pali]]) ([[translation]]: ''Protected by the [[Dharma]]''), was one of the [[missionary|missionaries]] sent by the [[Mauryan]] emperor [[Ashoka]] to proselytize the [[Buddhist]] faith. He is described as being a Greek ([[Pāli|Pali]]: "[[Yona]]", lit. "[[Ionia]]n") in the [[Mahavamsa]], and his activities are indicative of the strength of the Hellenistic [[Hellenistic Greece|Greek]] involvement during the formative centuries of Buddhism. Indeed, [[Menander I]] was famously converted to Buddhism by [[Nagasena]], who was a student of the Greek Buddhist monk [[Dharmaraksita]]. Menander is said to have reached enlightenment as an [[arhat]] under Nagasena's guidance and is recorded as a great patron of Buddhism. The dialogue of the Greek King Menander I ([[Pāli|Pali]] "Milinda") with the monk [[Nagasena]] comprises the Pali Buddhist work known as the [[Milinda Panha]].

Buddhist monks from the region of [[Gandhara]] in Afghanistan, where Greco-Buddhism was most influential, later played a key role in the development and the transmission of Buddhist ideas in the direction of northern Asia. Greco-Buddhist [[Kushan]] monks such as [[Lokaksema (Buddhist monk)|Lokaksema]] ({{circa|AD&amp;nbsp;178}}) travelled to the Chinese capital of [[Loyang]], where they became the first translators of Buddhist scriptures into Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Foltz|Foltz, Richard]], ''Religions of the Silk Road'', Palgrave Macmillan, 2nd edition, 2010, p. 46 {{ISBN|978-0-230-62125-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Central Asian and East Asian Buddhist monks appear to have maintained strong exchanges until around the 10th century, as indicated by the [[Bezeklik Thousand Buddha Caves]] frescos from the [[Tarim Basin]]. In legend too [[Bodhidharma]], the founder of [[Chán]]-Buddhism, which later became [[Zen]], and the legendary originator of the physical training of the [[Shaolin Monastery|Shaolin]] monks that led to the creation of [[Shaolin Kung Fu]], is described as a Buddhist monk from [[Buddhism in Central Asia|Central Asia]] in the first Chinese references to him (Yan Xuan-Zhi in 547).&lt;ref&gt;Broughton, Jeffrey L. (1999), The Bodhidharma Anthology: The Earliest Records of Zen, Berkeley: University of California Press, {{ISBN|0-520-21972-4}}. pp. 54-55.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout [[Buddhist art]], Bodhidharma is depicted as a rather ill-tempered, profusely bearded and wide-eyed barbarian, and he is referred as "The Blue-Eyed [[Barbarian]]" ({{zh|c=碧眼胡|p=Bìyǎn hú|labels=no}}) in Chinese Chan texts.&lt;ref&gt;Soothill, William Edward; Hodous, Lewis (1995), A Dictionary of Chinese Buddhist Terms, London: RoutledgeCurzon https://web.archive.org/web/20140303182232/http://buddhistinformatics.ddbc.edu.tw/glossaries/files/soothill-hodous.ddbc.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In 485 AD, according to the 7th century Chinese historic treatise [[Liang Shu]], five monks from Gandhara travelled to the country of [[Fusang]] ("The country of the extreme East" beyond the sea, probably eastern [[Japan]]), where they introduced Buddhism:

{{quote|"[[Fusang]] is located to the east of China, 20,000 ''[[Li (Chinese unit)|li]]'' [1,500&amp;nbsp;km] east of the state of ''Da Han'' (itself east of the state of ''Wa'' in modern [[Kyūshū]], [[Japan]]). (...) In former times, the people of Fusang knew nothing of the Buddhist religion, but in the second year of Da Ming of the [[Song dynasty]] [AD&amp;nbsp;485], five monks from Kipin ([[Kabul]] region of Gandhara) travelled by ship to Fusang. They propagated Buddhist doctrine, circulated scriptures and drawings, and advised the people to relinquish worldly attachments. As a result the customs of Fusang changed." (Chinese: "{{lang|zh|扶桑在大漢國東二萬餘里,地在中國之東(...)其俗舊無佛法,宋大明二年,罽賓國嘗有比丘五人游行至其國,流通佛法,經像,教令出家,風 俗遂改.}}")}}

Two half-brothers from [[Gandhara]], [[Asanga]] and [[Vasubandhu]] (4th century), created the [[Yogacara]] or "Mind-only" school of Mahayana Buddhism, which through one of its major texts, the [[Lankavatara Sutra]], became a founding block of Mahayana, and particularly Zen, philosophy.

===Greco-Buddhism in the West===
[[File:AsokaKandahar.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Kandahar Bilingual Rock Inscription]] ([[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Aramaic]]) 3rd century BC by Indian Buddhist King Ashoka. This edict advocates the adoption of "godliness" using the Greek term [[Eusebeia]] for [[Dharma]]. [[Kabul]] Museum.]]
Intense westward physical exchange at that time along the [[Silk Road]] is confirmed by the Roman craze for [[silk]] from the 1st century BC to the point that the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] issued, in vain, several edicts to prohibit the wearing of silk, on economic and moral grounds. This is attested by at least three authors: [[Strabo]] (64/63&amp;nbsp;BC – {{circa|AD&amp;nbsp;24}}), [[Seneca the Younger]] ({{circa|3&amp;nbsp;BC}} – AD&amp;nbsp;65), and [[Pliny the Elder]] (AD&amp;nbsp;23–79). The aforementioned Strabo and [[Plutarch]] ({{circa|45}}–125) also wrote about Indo-Greek Buddhist king [[Milinda|Menander]], confirming that information about the Indo-Greek Buddhists was circulating throughout the Hellenistic world.

[[Zarmanochegas]] (Zarmarus) (Ζαρμανοχηγὰς) was a monk of the [[Sramana]] tradition (possibly, but not necessarily a Buddhist) who, according to ancient historians such as [[Strabo]] and [[Dio Cassius]], met [[Nicholas of Damascus]] in [[Antioch]] while Augustus (died AD&amp;nbsp;14) was ruling the Roman Empire, and shortly thereafter proceeded to Athens where he burnt himself to death.&lt;ref name="perseus.tufts.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="liv, 9"/&gt; His story and tomb in Athens were well-known over a century later. [[Plutarch]] (died AD&amp;nbsp;120) in his Life of Alexander, after discussing the self-immolation of [[Calanus of India]] ([[Kalanos]]) witnessed by Alexander writes: "The same thing was done long after by another Indian who came with Caesar to Athens, where they still show you 'the Indian's Monument,'"&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch. 'Life of Alexander' in The Lives of the Noble Grecians and Romans. (trans John Dryden and revised Arthur Hugh Clough) The Modern Library (Random House Inc). New York.p850&lt;/ref&gt; referring to Zarmanochegas' tomb in Roman Athens.

Another century later the Christian church father [[Clement of Alexandria]] (died 215) mentioned Buddha by name in his Stromata (Bk I, Ch XV): "The Indian [[gymnosophists]] are also in the number, and the other barbarian philosophers. And of these there are two classes, some of them called Sarmanæ and others Brahmins. And those of the Sarmanæ who are called "Hylobii" neither inhabit cities, nor have roofs over them, but are clothed in the bark of trees, feed on nuts, and drink water in their hands. Like those called Encratites in the present day, they know not marriage nor begetting of children. Some, too, of the Indians obey the precepts of [[Buddha]] (Βούττα) whom, on account of his extraordinary sanctity, they have raised to divine honours."&lt;ref name="ccel.org"&gt;Clement of Alexandria Stromata.

Although the philosophical systems of Buddhism and Christianity have evolved in rather different ways, the moral precepts advocated by Buddhism from the time of Ashoka through his edicts do have some similarities with the Christian moral precepts developed more than two centuries later: respect for life, respect for the weak, rejection of violence, pardon to sinners, tolerance.

One theory is that these similarities may indicate the propagation of Buddhist ideals into the Western World, with the Greeks acting as intermediaries and religious syncretists.&lt;ref&gt;"Certain Indian notions may have made their way westward into the budding Christianity of the Mediterranean world through the channels of the Greek diaspora."  Foltz, ''Religions of the Silk Road'', p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"Scholars have often considered the possibility that Buddhism influenced the early development of Christianity. They have drawn attention to many parallels concerning the births, lives, doctrines, and deaths of the Buddha and Jesus" (Bentley, ''Old World Encounters'').}}

The story of the birth of the Buddha was well known in the West, and possibly influenced the story of the birth of Jesus: [[Jerome|Saint Jerome]] (4th century AD) mentions the birth of the Buddha, who he says "was born from the side of a virgin,"&lt;ref name="McEvilley, p391"&gt;McEvilley, p391&lt;/ref&gt; and the influential early Christian church father [[Clement of Alexandria]] (died AD 215) mentioned Buddha (Βούττα) in his Stromata (Bk I, Ch XV).&lt;ref name="ccel.org"/&gt; The legend of Christian saints [[Barlaam and Josaphat]] draws on the life of the Buddha.&lt;ref&gt;John Walbridge ''The Wisdom of the Mystic East: Suhrawardī and Platonic Orientalism'' Page 129  – 2001 "The form Būdhīsaf is the original, as shown by Sogdian form Pwtysfi and the early New Persian form Bwdysf. ... On the Christian versions see A. S. Geden, Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics, s.v. "Josaphat, Barlaam and," and M. P. Alfaric, ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Henryk Stażewski''' (9 January 1894 – 10 June 1988) was a Polish painter, considered to be a pioneer of the classical [[avant-garde]] of the 1920s and 1930s.

Stażewski was a foremost representative of the [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivist]] movement, as well as the co-creator of the [[Geometric abstraction|Geometric Abstract]] art movement, and a member of the [[Cercle et Carré]] group of abstract painters based in Paris.

The '''Holly Bluff Site''' ([[Smithsonian trinomial|22 YZ 557]]), sometimes known as the '''Lake George Site''', and locally as "The Mound Place," is an [[archaeological site]] that is a [[type site]] for the Lake George phase of the prehistoric [[Plaquemine culture]] period of the area. The site is on the southern margin of the [[Mississippian culture|Mississippian cultural]] advance down the [[Mississippi River]] and on the northern edge of that of the [[Coles Creek culture|Cole's Creek]] and Plaquemine cultures of the South."&lt;ref name="nhlsum"/&gt; The site was first excavated by [[Clarence Bloomfield Moore]] in 1908 and tested by [[Philip Phillips (archaeologist)|Philip Phillips]], [[Paul Gebhard]] and [[Nick Zeigler]] in 1949.

It was declared a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1964.&lt;ref name="nhlsum"/&gt;

==Location==
One of the half dozen really big sites in the State of [[Mississippi]], the Holly Bluff Site is located on the south bank of George Lake, or Lake George as it is sometimes known, a half mile east of its confluence with the [[Sunflower River]] and a mile and a half southeast of the village of [[Holly Bluff, Mississippi|Holly Bluff]], [[Yazoo County, Mississippi|Yazoo County]]. Today the site is bisected by a [[County highway|county road]] and is used as a plantation headquarters but still clearly visible are the numerous large mounds and the remains of a surrounding wall.

==Prehistoric Timeline==
[[File:Cahokian influence on Plaquemine culture map HRoe 2011.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Early Mississippian influence on the Yazoo Basin area]]
The sites occupation begins with a [[Jaketown Site|Jaketown Phase]] occupation evidenced by a scattering of [[Poverty Point culture|Poverty Point]] objects in the lowest levels of excavations. This is followed, after a hiatus evidenced by a complete lack of ''[[Tuscola Phase]]'' materials, by an early [[Marksville culture|Marksville period]] component tentatively assigned an early [[Anderson Landing Phase]] that may have lasted into an early Issaquena times. The succeeding late '[[Issaquena Phase]] and [[Deasonville Phase]]s are virtually unrepresented at Holly Bluff. The site was again occupied from the lower half of the [[Baytown culture|Baytown]] period up to the late prehistoric times. All phases of the local sequence from the Bayland on through the ''Lake George Phase (1350-1500)''(of which the site is the [[type site]] for the Lower Yazoo Basin Plaquemine chronology) are abundantly documented. Materials of the [[Crippen Point Phase]] of the Late Coles Creek appear to be most widely spread, and it may have been at this time that the settlement attained its greatest size. In the final Lake George Phase additions were made to some of the mounds, especially Mound A, and the enclosing embankment was built, but the total area occupied was perhaps not as large as in the preceding period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Phillips | first = Philip |  title = [[Archaeological Survey in the Lower Yazoo Basin, Mississippi, 1949-1955]] | publisher = [[Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology]] | year = 1970 | pages = 278}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Site Description==
It will be noted that Mound A is almost the exact center of the site, a most unusual location for the dominant mound in ceremonial centers of the Coles Creek and Mississippi periods. In the case of centers the [[plaza]] is normally the central feature with the principal "[[Platform mound|temple mound]]" located on one side, usually but not always the west, its principal ramp giving access from the plaza on the east side of the mound. In the case of Holly Bluff there seems to have been two plazas to the east and west of the Mound A respectively.

Sampling evidence supports the theory that Mound A was originally part of a group (including mounds B, C, D, E, and F) surrounding the western plaza possibly as early as the [[Bayland phase]] (but more likely the [[Aden Site|Aden phase]]), and certainly established by the [[Kings Crossing Site|Kings Crossing phase]]. Mound A may or may not have been the principal structure at this time. This plan may have carried on into the Crippen Point phase, but the evidence strongly suggests that either then or in the succeeding [[Mayersville Archeological Site|Mayersville phase]] site reorientation took place. Mound A becoming the principle feature of an east plaza assemblage (with mounds F', G, G', H, U, and V) which remained the ritual center of the site throughout the remainder of its history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Phillips | first = Philip |  title = [[Archaeological Survey in the Lower Yazoo Basin, Mississippi, 1949-1955]] | publisher = [[Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology]] | year = 1970 | pages = 288–289 | authorlink = Philip Phillips (archaeologist)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The twenty-five mounds that are now recognized range from barely noticeable rises to the massive Mound A, which is {{convert|55|ft|m}} high and covers nearly two acres.  It is believed that the lower rises were used as house substructures and repeatedly reconstructed. The larger mounds were most likely used for ceremonial purposes rather than residential.  Until recent erosion, earthen ramps could be seen climbing to the summits of these large mounds. Seven of the mounds are situated along the bank of George Lake and six more are located within the embankment. The remaining twelve mounds are positioned around the two plazas situated to the east and west of Mound A.  This design is unusual and extremely large for the area; the closest in size and layout being the [[Winterville Site]].&lt;ref name="Williams 1960"&gt;{{cite book| authors= Williams, Stephen and [[Jeffrey Phipps Brain|Brain, Jeffrey P.]]| title =1983 Excavations at the Lake George Site Yazoo County Mississippi|pages= 1958–1960.|publisher=[[Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology]], [[Harvard University Press]], [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]|isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
The final major feature of the site is the earthen wall and the trench that surrounds it on three sides. In the earliest survey of the site, C. B. Moore reported that the wall was four to {{convert|6|ft|m}} high and still reached this height although large sections have now been destroyed. It is likely that the ditch, which was filled with water from George Lake, supplied the dirt for the wall. The one side that was not protected by the wall was the lake side of the site, the lake bank creating a steep enough boundary on this northern side to provide protection.

Besides topographical settings, the environment of the Lake George site was extremely favorable for occupation. In prehistoric times the rich soils and the varying ecologies supported a vast array of plant and animal species.&lt;ref Name="Williams 1960"/&gt; The natural levees created by deposits from the Mississippi were made of rich sandy and silty loams which allowed the common Southeastern deciduous hardwoods, such as [[hickory]], [[elm]], [[fraxinus|ash]], [[Eastern Cottonwood|cottonwood]], [[maple]], [[pecan]], [[Celtis occidentalis|hackberry]], [[honey locust]], [[Platanus occidentalis|sycamore]], and even [[Nyssa sylvatica|gums]] and [[oak]]s to flourish. The swamps surrounding the site supported an entirely different ecosystem including [[alligator]]s, small reptiles and [[aquatic plant]]s.&lt;ref name="Williams 1960"/&gt; The streams and rivers also provided fish, shellfish, and other aquatic fauna, which can be seen from excavations of shell middens and deposits of the site.&lt;ref name="Williams 1960"/&gt; These waterways also provided a major form of communication. This abundant region was obviously utilized by many different peoples over the course of prehistory as the Holly Bluff Site shows.

==Excavations==
Looting, erosion and cultivation have extensively damaged the Holy Bluff site over the years. This has caused some debate over the form and degree of some of the earthworks.  Clarence B. Moore noted in 1908, following a visit, that some thirty rises and mounds, small and large, could be counted within the enclosure. Nine years later Calvin S. Brown visited and counted only twenty-five or so mounds within the wall.&lt;ref name="Williams 1960"/&gt; In 1928 and again in 1936 James A. Ford recorded only twenty-two mounds.  In a site report in January 1941, [[Jesse D. Jennings]] described twenty-seven mounds and some questionable rises.&lt;ref name="Williams 1960"/&gt; C. B. Moore's original estimate is believed to most accurately reflect the situation; many of the smaller earthworks have been lost to recent and intense cultivation.

In January and February 1908, [[Clarence Bloomfield Moore]]  received permission from the then owner Judge William Andrew Henry of Yazoo City to excavate the sites along the [[Yazoo River]] and its tributary the [[Sunflower River]] in his steamboat, The Gopher.&lt;ref name="Williams 1960"/&gt; On his excavation Moore recorded eleven sites and partially excavated eight, including Holly Bluff: "with a large force to dig, including May who had been in our service before, we go directly to work on such mounds".&lt;ref name="Clarence Bloomfield Moore"&gt;{{cite book|author=Moore, Clarence B. | title =Certain Mounds of Arkansas and Mississippi|publisher=Reprint from Journal of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, 13|pages=480–600|authorlink=Clarence Bloomfield Moore}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moore commented on the physical appearance of the site: "Strewn over the enclosed area, among the mounds and on them…are [[chert]] pebbles; fragments of chert; bits of mussel shell; and small parts of earthenware vessels"&lt;ref name="Clarence Bloomfield Moore"/&gt; Most of the earthenware was undecorated, he recorded, and mostly shell tempered with some stone tempering which is common in the Yazoo-Sunflower region.&lt;ref name="Williams 1960"/&gt; C. B. Moore's excavations produced various small artifacts including projectile points, a [[pebble ax]] of [[fossilized wood]], a chert [[hammerstone]], and a [[zoomorphic]] effigy pipe of [[Mississippian culture pottery|shell-tempered pottery]].  He was disappointed, however, in finding nothing of great importance other than two disturbed burials in a mound on the lake front.&lt;ref name="Williams 1960"/&gt;  Moore's disappointment was evident in his failing to map the site and his statement, "it having become evident to us that our search was inadequately rewarded".&lt;ref name="Clarence Bloomfield Moore"/&gt;

Numerous other archaeologists with varying degrees of success followed up Moore's excavations. Each of the later excavations found an extremely different system of mounds. In the 1920s the site was damaged by the then-plantation owner Mr. Charles W. Perry who pastured cattle on the large mounds and cultivated the smaller mounds.&lt;ref name="Williams 1960"/&gt;  The cattle foraged the cover of the larger mounds and their trampling eroded much of the site, erasing the ramps described by Moore. In 1949 [[Philip Phillips (archaeologist)|Philip Phillips]], [[Paul Gebhard]] and [[Nick Zeigler]] began performing test excavations of the Holly Bluff site.  These were the first truly scientific excavations carried out at the site.  The interpretations of the data provided the first reliable conclusions of the culture history.&lt;ref name="Williams 1960"/&gt; These tests finally provided evidence that the Holly Bluff site had been occupied for approximately one millennium.&lt;ref name="Williams 1960"/&gt;  The conclusions proved that the Holly Bluff site was an important phase of the [[Coles Creek culture]]. From 1958 to 1960, "hundreds of skeletons were removed" from Mound C.&lt;ref name="Williams 1960"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26604">The '''innateness hypothesis''' is an expression coined by [[Hilary Putnam]] to refer to a linguistic theory of [[language acquisition]] which holds that at least some knowledge about language exists in humans at birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/innateness+hypothesis |title=Innateness hypothesis &amp;#124; Define Innateness hypothesis at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic1327223.files/Putnam%20item.pdf |date= |accessdate=2016-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Putnam used the expression "the innateness hypothesis" to target linguistic nativism and specifically the views of [[Noam Chomsky]].  Facts about the complexity of human language systems, the universality of language acquisition, the facility that children demonstrate in acquiring these systems, and the comparative performance of adults in attempting the same task are all commonly invoked in support. However, the validity of Chomsky's approach is still debated. Empiricists advocate that language is entirely learned. Some have criticized Chomsky's work, pinpointing problems with his theories while others have proposed new theories to account for language acquisition (with specific differences in terms of language acquisition per se compared to second language acquisition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lightbown |first1=Patsy |last2=Spada |first2=Nina |title=How Languages are Learned |date=2006 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-442224-6 |page=35 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

==Linguistic nativism==
Linguistic nativism is the theory that humans are born with some knowledge of language. One acquires a language not entirely through learning.

Human language is complicated and is said to form one of the most complex areas of human cognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goldberg|first1=Adele E|title=Universal Grammar? Or prerequisites for natural language?|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|date=2008|volume=31|issue=5|pages=522–523|doi=10.1017/s0140525x0800513x}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite its complexity, children are able to accurately acquire a language within a short period of time. Moreover, research has shown that language acquisition among children (including the blind and the deaf) occurs in ordered developmental stages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Laurence|first1=Stephen|last2=Margolis|first2=Eric|title=The Poverty of the Stimulus Argument|journal=The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science|date=2001|volume=52|issue=2|pages=217–276|doi=10.1093/bjps/52.2.217}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This highlights the possibility of humans having an innate language acquisition ability. According to Noam Chomsky,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chomsky|first1=N|title=Language and the problems of knowledge|date=1988|publisher=MIT Press|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The speed and precision of vocabulary acquisition leaves no real alternative to the conclusion that the child somehow has the concepts available before experience with language and is basically learning labels for concepts that are  already a part of his or her conceptual apparatus." Chomsky's view that the human faculty of language is innate is also affirmed by [[Steven Pinker]]. Moreover, in his work, The Language Instinct, Pinker argued that language in humans is a biological adaptation—language is hard-wired into our minds by evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pinker|first1=Steven|title=The language instinct : how the mind creates language|date=2007|publisher=Harper Perennial Modern Classics|location=New York|edition=1st Harper Perennial Modern Classics}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in contrast to children's ease in language acquisition, having passed the critical age for language acquisition the complexity of a language often makes it challenging for adult learners to pick up a second language.&lt;ref name=Clark&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clark|first1=Alexander Simon|last2=Lappin|first2=Shalom|title=Linguistic nativism and the poverty of the stimulus|date=2010|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd|location=Hoboken}}&lt;/ref&gt; More often than not, unlike children, adults are unable to acquire native-like proficiency.&lt;ref name=Clark/&gt;
Hence, with this idea in mind, nativists advocate that the fundamentals of language and grammar are innate rather than acquired through learning. The innateness hypothesis supports language nativism and several reasons and concepts have been proposed to support and explain this hypothesis. In his work, Chomsky introduced the idea of a [[language acquisition device]] (LAD) to account for the competence of humans in acquiring a language. The [[universal grammar]] (UG) that is also often credited to Chomsky was later introduced.

=== Language acquisition device===
According to Chomsky, humans are born with a set of language learning tools referred to as the LAD. The LAD is an abstract part of the human mind which houses the ability for humans to acquire and produce language.&lt;ref name=Volkmar&gt;{{cite book|last1=Volkmar|first1=Fred R.|title=Encyclopedia of Autism Spectrum Disorders|date=2013|publisher=Springer New York|location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chomsky expressed that children are able to derive rules of a language through hypothesis testing because they are equipped with a LAD. The LAD then transforms these rules into basic grammar.&lt;ref name=Volkmar/&gt; Hence, according to Chomsky, the LAD explains why children seem to have the innate ability to acquire a language and accounts for why no explicit teaching is required for a child to acquire a language.

=== Universal grammar ===
In his argument for the existence of a LAD, Chomsky proposed that for a child to acquire a language, sufficient innate language-specific knowledge is needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goldberg|first1=Adele E|title=Universal Grammar? Or prerequisites for natural language?|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|date=2008|volume=31|issue=5|pages=522–523|doi=10.1017/s0140525x0800513x}}&lt;/ref&gt; These constraints were later termed as universal grammar (UG). In this theory, it is suggested that all humans have a set of limited rules for grammar that are universal to all natural human languages. These rules are genetically wired into our brains and they can be altered in correspondence to the language children are exposed to. In other words, under this theory, language acquisition is seen as a process of filtering through the set of possible grammatical structures in natural languages pre-programmed in one's mind and this is guided by the language input in one's environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lewis|first1=John D|last2=Elman|first2=Jeffrey L|title=Learnability and the Statistical Structure of Language: Poverty of Stimulus Arguments Revisited|journal=Proceedings of the Annual Boston University Conference on Language Development|date=2002|volume=26|issue=1|pages=359–370}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chomsky later introduced [[generative grammar]]. He argued that "properties of a generative grammar arise from an "innate" universal grammar".&lt;ref name="Abushıbab"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Abushıbab |first1=İbrahim |title=Can Transformational Generative Grammar Be Used For Pedagogical Purposes? |journal=Ekev Academic Review |date=2008 |volume=12 |issue=36 |pages=301–312}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory of generative grammar describes a set of rules that are used to order words correctly in order to form grammatically-sound sentences.&lt;ref name="Abushıbab" /&gt; It also attempts to describe a speaker's innate grammatical knowledge.&lt;ref name="Abushıbab" /&gt;

=== Poverty of stimulus ===
One of the most significant arguments generative grammarians had for language nativism is the [[poverty of the stimulus]] argument. Since 1980, the poverty of stimulus became increasingly integrated into the theory of generative grammar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thomas|first1=Margaret|title=Development of the Concept of 'the Poverty of the Stimulus'|journal=Linguistic Review|date=2002|volume=19|pages=51–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this argument, Noam Chomsky put forth that the amount of input a child receives during language acquisition is insufficient to account for the linguistic output.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Behme|first1=Christina|last2=Deacon|first2=S Helene|title=Language Learning in Infancy: Does the Empirical Evidence Support a Domain Specific Language Acquisition Device?|journal=4015: psycholinguistics; child language acquisition|date=2008|volume=21|issue=5|pages=641–671|doi=10.1080/09515080802412321}}&lt;/ref&gt; To be exact, he said that, "the native speaker has acquired a grammar on the basis of very restricted and degenerate evidence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chomsky|first1=Noam|title=Language and mind.|date=1972|publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|location=New York|edition=Enl.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in his paper, Pinker concludes that humans have a system that is more sophisticated than what they are being exposed to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pinker|first1=Steven|title=Rules of Language|journal=Science|volume=253|issue=5019|doi=10.1126/science.1857983|pmid=1857983|pages=530–535|year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their article, Pullum and Scholz summarised the properties of a child's environment.&lt;ref name="PullumScholz2002"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pullum |first1=Geoffrey K. |last2=Scholz |first2=Barbara C. |title=Empirical assessment of stimulus poverty arguments |journal=Linguistic Review |date=2002 |volume=19 |issue=1/2}}&lt;/ref&gt; They identified properties of positivity, degeneracy, incompleteness and idiosyncrasy. Under positivity, they assert that children are only exposed to positive linguistic data. Moreover, there is lack in negative data that aids a child in identifying ungrammatical sentences that are unacceptable in the language.&lt;ref name="PullumScholz2002" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Longa|first1=Víctor M|title=What about a (really) minimalist theory of language acquisition?|journal=Linguistics|date=2008|volume=46|issue=3|pages=541–570|doi=10.1515/ling.2008.018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also claimed that children are unable to acquire a language with positive evidence alone. In addition, under degeneracy, it is stated that children are often exposed to linguistic data that are erroneous. This is supported by Zohari that states that in adult speech, erroneous utterances that include speech slips, ungrammatical sentences, incomplete sentences etc. are often observed.&lt;ref name="Zohari"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zohari |first1=Parissa |title=Language acquisition and the argument from the poverty of the stimulus |journal=ProQuest Dissertations and Theses |date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the linguistic data each child is exposed to is different (i.e. idiosyncrasy) and there are many utterances that a child might not have heard (i.e. incompleteness). However, despite the properties mentioned above, children would eventually be able to deliver a linguistic output that is similar to the target language within a relatively short amount of time.&lt;ref name="Zohari" /&gt; In contrast, when placed in certain environments, other organisms are unable to attain the language mastery humans have reached.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chomsky|first1=Noam|title=Poverty of Stimulus: Unfinished Business|journal=Studies in Chinese Linguistics|date=2012|volume=33|issue=1|pages=3–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From the nativists' point of view, all of these highlight that babies are hard-wired with a UG and thus support the innateness hypothesis.

However, it is important to note that the argument that the poverty of stimulus supports the innateness hypothesis remains very controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Laurence|first1=Stephen|title=The Poverty of the Stimulus Argument|journal=The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science|date=2001|volume=52|issue=2|pages=217–276|doi=10.1093/bjps/52.2.217}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, in one of the latest work against the poverty of stimulus argument, Fiona Cowie wrote in her paper that the Poverty of Stimulus argument fails "on both empirical and conceptual grounds to support nativism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cowie|first1=Fiona|title=What's Within? Nativism Reconsidered|date=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Critical period hypothesis ===
The [[critical period hypothesis]] by Linguist [[Eric Lenneberg]] states that full native competence in acquiring a language can only be achieved during an optimal period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lenneberg|first1=E.H.|title=Biological foundations of language|date=1967|publisher=Wiley|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothesis supports the innateness hypothesis about the biological innateness of linguistic competence. Lenneberg expressed that age plays a salient role in the ability to acquire language. According to him, a child before the age of two will not sufficiently acquire language, while development of full native competence in a language must occur before the onset of puberty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lenneberg|first1=E. H.|title=Biological Foundations of Language|date=1967|publisher=Wiley|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that language is innate that occurs through development instead of feedback from the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chomsky and language learning.|url=http://www2.vobs.at/ludescher/Ludescher/LAcquisition/Nativist/nativist%20theory.htm|accessdate=14 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, should a child not hear any language during this period, the child would not be able to learn nor be able to speak. This hypothesis is also said to explain why adults do not acquire languages as well as children.

Evidence for the critical period hypothesis can be seen in the case of [[Genie (feral child)|Genie]]. When discovered, she was without language. Genie's subsequent language acquisition process was studied, whereby her linguistic performance, cognitive and emotional development was deemed abnormal. Genie was said to have right-hemisphere language, resembling other cases where language was acquired outside of the "critical period".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Curtiss|first1=Susan|title=Genie: A Psycholinguistic Study of a Modern-Day "Wild Child"|date=1977|publisher=Academic Press|location=Boston, MA|pages=234}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would lend support to Lenneberg's hypothesis. Moreover, some saw the case of Genie as a support to the innateness hypothesis. When the LAD is not triggered during the critical period, the natural process of language acquisition cannot be reached.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=D.H.|title=Principles of language learning and teaching|date=2000|publisher=Addison Wesley Longman, Inc.|location=New York|edition=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Genie's case is complex and controversial. It has been  argued that it does not support linguistic innateness. Some have asserted that there is at least a possible degree of first language acquisition beyond the critical period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Snow E.|first1=Catherine|last2=Hoefnagel-Höhle|first2=Marian|title=The Critical Period for Language Acquisition: Evidence from Second Language Learning|journal=Society for Research in Child Development|date=1978|volume=49|issue=4|pages=1114–1128|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.1978.tb04080.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MayberryEichen1991"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mayberry |first1=Rachel I. |last2=Eichen |first2=Ellen B. |title=The critical period for language acquisition and the deaf child's language comprehension: a psycholinguistic approach |journal=Journal of Memory and Language |date=1991 |volume=30 |issue=4 |pages=486–512 |doi=10.1016/0749-596x(91)90018-f}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the emotional and cognitive deprivation may have also played a part in Genie's linguistic and cognitive difficulties.&lt;ref name="MayberryEichen1991" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sampson|first1=Geoffrey|title=Educating Eve: The 'Language Instinct' Debate|date=1997|publisher=Cassell|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of the [[Nicaraguan sign language]] by students in a school for the deaf also lends evidence to the hypothesis. Initially a [[pidgin]] sign language with simple grammar, there were large grammatical differences and variations across signers. Eventually, the pidgin became a full-fledged language (like a [[Creole language|creole]])  as younger signers developed a significantly more grammatically structured and regular system&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sandler|first1=Wendy|title=Sign language: An overview|url=http://sandlersignlab.haifa.ac.il/html/html_eng/pdf/Sign_Language_Overview_ELL2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as specific grammatical structures&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Senghas|first1=Ann|title=The Development of Nicaraguan Sign Language via the Language Acquisition Process|journal=Proceedings of Boston University Child Language Development|date=1995|volume=19|pages=543–552}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, the differences in abilities between the younger and older students to use sign language are said to suggest evidence for a critical period. The spontaneity of the development of NSL also shows that there is an innate element to the process of language learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Children create new sign language|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/3662928.stm|website=BBC News|accessdate=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, the critical period hypothesis in relation to language acquisition is also widely debated. Other research has also indicated that any age effects depend largely on the opportunities for learning, learning situations and how significant the initial exposure is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lightbown |first1=Patsy M. |title=Classroom SLA research and second language teaching |journal=Applied Linguistics |date=2000 |volume=21 |issue=4 |pages=431–462 |doi=10.1093/applin/21.4.431}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Linguistic empiricism==
[[Empiricism]] is the theory that all knowledge is based on experience derived from the senses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Empiricism|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/empiricism|website=Oxford Dictionaries|accessdate=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Empiricists only study observable behaviour instead of unobservable mental representations, states and processes. They claim that sense and experience is the ultimate source of all concepts and knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Markie|first1=Peter|title=Rationalism vs. Empiricism|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2013/entries/rationalism-empiricism/|website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=17 October 2014|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, linguistic empiricism is a perspective where language is entirely learned. These data-driven theorists also support that children do not have linguistically-specific knowledge at birth. Language and grammar are only learned through exposure and accumulated experience. This is also called the "nurture" perspective as opposed to the "nature" perspective (linguistic nativism).

Against Chomsky's Innateness Hypothesis, philosopher [[John Locke]] insisted that our knowledge, including language, cannot be innate.&lt;ref name=Locke&gt;{{cite book|last1=Book|first1=I|last2=II|first2=Book II|last3=Locke|first3=John|title=An essay concerning human understanding|publisher=Edwin Mellen Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, all ideas are derived from experience.&lt;ref name=Locke/&gt; [[Geoffrey Sampson]] also showed the same stand by stating that "Our languages are not inborn but are learned wholly with experience."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sampson|first1=Geoffrey|title=Linguistic universals as evidence for empiricism|date=1978|publisher=Cambridge Univ Press|pages=183–206}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Empiricists have criticised concepts like generative grammar that support linguistic nativism. In fact, some would argue that "language structure" is created through language use.&lt;ref name=Tomasello&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tomasello|first1=Michael|last2=Tomasello|first2=Michael|title=Constructing a language: A usage-based theory of language acquisition|date=2009|publisher=Harvard University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, they assert that theories like the [[Language Acquisition Device|LAD]] are unsupported by empirical evidence.

===Arguments===
Contrastive analyses about the innateness hypothesis have been done by [[Jacek Fisiak]] in 1980.&lt;ref name=Fisiak&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fisiak|first1=Jacek|title=Theoretical issues in contrastive linguistics|date=1981|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Fisiak's analysis, [[Hilary Putnam|Putnam]], Hiż and [[Nelson Goodman|Goodman]] criticized Chomsky's innate hypothesis by stating that:

#The fact that languages have similar properties is common and natural.&lt;ref name=Fisiak/&gt; There is no necessity to appeal to innate concepts for the explanation of this fact.  Goodman also expressed that claims about language universals are dubious. He argues that it is not surprising that languages in the world will coincidentally have features in common.&lt;ref name=Chapman&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chapman|first1=Siobhan|title=Philosophy for linguists: an introduction|date=2000|publisher=Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the claim that common features, which have been identified as natural 'language universals', should not be supported.&lt;ref name=Chapman/&gt;
#The hypothesis cannot be supported by empirical evidence.&lt;ref name=Fisiak/&gt;
It is hard to explain what it is for someone to have an innate concept since empirical evidence to support this theory is hard to find.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Markie|first1=Peter|title=Rationalism vs. Empiricism|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2013/entries/rationalism-empiricism/#4|website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, there is no way to falsify the theory unless empirical evidence is found.

Over the years, many theories that are against language innateness have been developed to account for language acquisition. Many have championed that human beings learn language through experience with some leaning towards children being equipped with learning mechanisms while others suggesting that social situations or cognitive capacities can account for language learning.

Bates and Elman summarised a research conducted by Saffran, Aslin and Newport&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Saffran|first1=Jenny R|last2=Aslin|first2=Richard N|last3=Newport|first3=Elissa L|title=Statistical learning by 8-month-old infants|journal=Science|date=1996|volume=274|issue=5294|pages=1926–1928|doi=10.1126/science.274.5294.1926|pmid=8943209}}&lt;/ref&gt; that supports that learning is "a purely inductive, statistically driven process".&lt;ref name="pmid8984644"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bates |first1=Elizabeth |last2=Elman |first2=Jeffrey |title=Learning Rediscovered |journal= Science |date=1996 |volume=274 |issue=5294 |pages=1849–1850 |doi=10.1126/science.274.5294.1849 |pmid=8984644}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the research, it was found that 8 month old infants were able to use simple statistics to identify word boundaries in speech. The results of the research highlight that language acquisition is a process of learning through statistical means. Moreover, it raises the possibility that infants possess experience-dependent mechanisms that allow for word segmentation and acquisition of other aspects of language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jenkin|first1=Lyle|title=Biolinguistics: Exploring the Biology of Language|date=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=264}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Bates and Elman found that this contradicts the extensive view that human beings are unable and cannot utilize generalized statistical procedures for language acquisition.&lt;ref name="pmid8984644" /&gt; This is empirical evidence for linguistic empiricism, thereby going against the innateness hypothesis.

[[Michael Tomasello]]'s findings highlight the significance of a usage-based theory of language acquisition and indicates that there is a relation between cognitive and social skills with linguistic competence.&lt;ref name=Tomasello/&gt; This shows the importance of the role of experience in language acquisition. By empirically studying the developmental stages of child language acquisition, he argues that children have specific cognitive capacities at birth that promote growth in linguistic competence and specific interpersonal abilities that aid language learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Joseph T|first1=Kessler|title=Michael Tomasello on Language Development: The Puzzle of Human Linguistic Uniqueness|journal=Handbook of Child Psychology: Cognitive Development|date=2010|pages=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he emphasised that this does not prove that language is innate. In addition, his experiments indicate that children's awareness and understanding of the intentional communicative cues displayed by others is a salient social cognitive skill that determines their ability to learn words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hurford|first1=James R|title=Review of Michael Tomasello and Elizabeth Bates (eds.), Language Development: the essential readings|url=http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/~jim/tomasello.bates.revu.html|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tomasello also stated that young children's initial multi-word productions are very concrete as they are based on specific words and phrases instead of innate and abstract linguistic categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tomasello|first1=Michael|last2=Bates|first2=Elizabeth|title=Language Development: The Essential Readings|date=2001|publisher=Blackwell Publishers|pages=388}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, this would explain why grammar development is progressive and word-specific.

[[Geoffrey Sampson]] also supports that the "richness of the environment" plays a role in language acquisition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jabli|first1=Taieb|title=Chomskyan Rationalist Approach to Language Acquisition Versus The Empiricist Approach|url=https://www.academia.edu/3461596/Chomskyan_Rationalist_Approach_to_Language_Acquisition_Versus_The_Empiricist_Approach|website=Academia.edu|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Sampson observed that not only human beings but all species are capable of recognizing speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Geoffrey|first1=Sampson|title=The 'Language Instinct' Debate|date=2005|publisher=Continuum|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ability indicates that a child is equipped with the capacity for normalisation which plays a fundamental role in acquiring the phonology of a language. Therefore, he contends that a child is born with the ability to learn and this is through testing and guessing instead of the innate ability that nativists support.

'''''Ius indigenatus''''' ([[Latin]] for "right of local birth") is a [[right]] which was from the 15th to the 18th century a requirement for people to hold office in Prussia. It limited offices and land ownership to local [[Prussia (region)|Prussian]] natives, i.e. persons from the [[Monastic state of the Teutonic Knights]] as of 1453.

When the Prussian cities (some of them [[Hanseatic league]] members) and gentry (many of German origin) seceded from the Order in 1454, it was, along with [[Danzig's privileges]], a prerequisite for a [[personal union]] with the [[King of Poland]]. It was confirmed in 1466 by the [[Second Peace of Thorn]] which secured a large decree of [[autonomy]] for [[Royal Prussia]]. The Prussian Ius indigenatus was valid for both parts of Prussia separated in 1466, the western part, later called [[Royal Prussia]], and the eastern part, from 1525 the [[Duchy of Prussia]], later [[East Prussia]]. 

At times this Prussian birthright (nationality), has been frequently ignored by the Polish side in later centuries. 

In [[Silesia]], the Silesian Ius indigenatus was customary as well.

'''Jacmel''', ({{lang-ht|Jakmèl}}; {{lang-es|Yáquimo}}) is a [[List of communes of Haiti|commune]] in southern [[Haiti]] founded by the Spanish in 1504&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Carl Ortwin Sauer|title=The Early Spanish Main|date=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-521-08059-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_xmGrUQG_rEC&amp;lpg=PA153&amp;pg=PA153#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; and repopulated by the French in 1698. It is the capital of the [[Departments of Haiti|department]] of [[Sud-Est (department)|Sud-Est]] and has an estimated population of 40,000, while the commune of Jacmel had a population of 137,966 at the 2003 Census. The town's name is derived from its indigenous [[Taíno people|Taíno]] name of ''Yaquimel''. In 1925, Jacmel was dubbed as the "City of Light," becoming the first in the Caribbean to have electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/lighting-the-way-forward-in-haiti/article1319729/?service=mobile |title=Lighting the way forward in Haiti |author=Leeder, Jessica |publisher=The Global and Mail |year=2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city has well-preserved historical French colonial architecture that dates back from the early nineteenth century and has little changed. The town has been tentatively accepted as a [[World Heritage site]] and [[UNESCO]] reports that it has sustained damage in the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]].&lt;ref name="heritage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/579|title=Heritage in Haiti|date=2010-01-20|publisher=UNESCO.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2010}}
The town was founded by the "Compagnie de Saint-Domingue" in 1698 as the capital of the southeastern part of the French colony [[Saint-Domingue]]. The area now called Jacmel was [[Taíno people|Taíno]] territory, part of the Xaragua chiefdom ruled by cacique Bohechio. With the arrival of the French, and the later establishment of the town, the French renamed Yaquimel as Jacmel.

The city was developed to boost sugar production and trade, but soon it evolved into a coffee trading centre. In 1896 it suffered a major fire that destroyed most of the buildings in the city. The city was rebuilt, often using prefabricated cast-iron pillars and balconies shipped from [[France]]. Many ornate mansions of wealthy coffee merchants from this time have been preserved up to this day without much change and the whole central part of the city has changed little over the last 100 years{{when|date=February 2016}}.

The mansions of Jacmel, with their cast-iron pillars and balconies, would later influence the homes in much of [[New Orleans]]. Today, many of these homes are now artisan shops that sell vibrant handicrafts, [[papier-mâché]] masks, and carved-wood animal figures. In recent years, efforts have been made to revitalize the once flourishing [[cigar]] and [[coffee]] industries. The town is a popular tourist destination in Haiti due to its relative tranquility and distance from the political turmoil that plagues [[Port-au-Prince]].

Over the years, this rather small town experienced a number of noted historical events. Some of these occurrences are:

===War of Knives===
[[Toussaint Louverture]] fought over Jacmel in the so-called [[War of Knives]] between him and his fellow countryman [[André Rigaud]], who wished to maintain authority over the city. This war began in June 1799. By November the rebels were pushed back to this strategic southern port, the defence of which was commanded by [[Alexandre Pétion]]. Jacmel fell to Toussaint's troops in February 1800, during which the [[United States|American]] warship [[USS General Greene (1799)|USS ''General Greene'']] bombarded the city. After which the rebellion was effectively over. Pétion and other [[mulatto]] leaders subsequently went into exile in France.

===Creation of the Gran Colombia flag===
A Venezuelan predecessor of [[Simón Bolívar]] in the liberation struggle against colonialism in Venezuelan and much of Spanish-ruled South America, [[Francisco de Miranda]] created the first [[flag of Gran Colombia]] near Jacmel, which served as the national flag of the [[First Republic of Venezuela]]. Anchored in the Bay of Jacmel (''Baie de Jacmel''), he first raised the flag on March 12, 1806, on the corvette ''Leander''. This day is still celebrated as Venezuelan Flag Day. The general design of the Gran Colombian flag served as the model for the current flags of Venezuela, Colombia and Ecuador, which emerged as independent nations at the breakup of Gran Colombia in 1830. This flag is often referred to as the "bandera madre" (mother flag) due to its role as inspiration and resemblance to the flags of Colombia and Ecuador.

===Ramón Emeterio Betances===
Puerto Rican pro-independence leader [[Ramón Emeterio Betances]] spent a short interval in Jacmel in 1870, from where he gathered support for an uprising in the Dominican Republic, seeking to install a liberal government there. Then-president of Haiti, [[Nissage Saget]] supported Betances's ideals of a pan-Antillean union, and gave the uprising his support.

===Modern Jacmel prior to the 12 January 2010 earthquake===

The port town is internationally known for its very vibrant art scene and elegant townhouses dating from the 19th century. Among the wealth of art and crafts available in Jacmel are the papier-mâché, done by nearly 200 artisans and the renowned Atelier created by Moro Baruk. In recent years Jacmel has been host to a large film festival, called the ''[[Jacmel Film Festival]]'', that started in 2004, and in 2007 the international ''[[Jacmel Music Festival]]'' was successfully launched as well. Its carnival, the nearby [[Bassin Bleu (Jacmel)|Bassin Bleu]] (Haiti's most famous natural deep pools), and the scenic white sand (Timouillage, Cabic, Raymond-les-bains, located primarily in Cayes-Jacmel) beaches attract many visitors. The town is regarded as one of the safest in the country, and foreign visitors that come to Haiti seeking tranquility often go for Jacmel. Its urbanization has been increasing in large part due to the income generated by tourism. Royal Caribbean, the leading tourism company whose cruise ships regularly dock at [[Labadee]], plans to add stopovers at Jacmel. In February 2007, Edwin Zenny became the town's newly elected mayor. In addition, the [[Jacmel Film Festival]] is held there annually. On January 11, 2010, [[Choice Hotels]] announced they would open a 120-room [[Comfort Inn]] in Jacmel, the first chain hotel to be opened there in a decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Chain Hotels Coming Back to Haiti |date=January 11, 2010  |work=ABC News |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Travel/wireStory?id=9534520}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010 Haiti earthquake===
{{main|2010 Haiti earthquake}}

On 12 January 2010, Haiti experienced [[2010 Haiti earthquake|a magnitude 7.0 earthquake]] that caused heavy damage and casualties in Jacmel.&lt;ref&gt;[https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/recenteqsww/Quakes/us2010rja6.php "Magnitude 7.0 – HAITI REGION"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110603050654/http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/recenteqsww/Quakes/us2010rja6.php |date=2011-06-03 }}, [[United States Geological Survey]]&lt;/ref&gt; The first temblor rocked the city at 4:40 pm, but the later temblor at 5:37 pm stopped the cathedral's clock. A Jacmel radio station estimated that at least 5000 were dead from the quake itself, although mayor Zennie Edwin later reported that the figure was closer to 300–500 deaths and 4,000 injured. About 70 per cent of the homes were damaged, with most of the heavier damage being in the poorer neighbourhoods.&lt;ref&gt;AFP, [http://www.mysinchew.com/node/34251 "In Haiti, the Jacmel cathedral clock stopped at 5:37 pm"], 20 January 2010 (accessed 20 January 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; The town hall was so severely damaged that it had to be demolished.&lt;ref&gt;Leeder, Jessica (9 February 2010) [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/blogs/project-jacmel-blog/welcome-to-jacmel/article1463734/ "Welcome to Jacmel"], ''Globe and Mail''.&lt;/ref&gt; A small [[tsunami]] hit Jacmel Bay, with the ocean receding, leaving fish high and dry on the seabed, and rushing back in, four times.&lt;ref&gt;Kinzie, Susan (24 January 2010) [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/23/AR2010012302632.html "In Jacmel, Haiti, parties give way to aftershocks and rescue missions"], ''Washington Post''.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Recovery====
In December 2010, the [[Capponi Construction Group]], a Miami-based construction company, decided to help with the revitalization of Jacmel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fagenson|first=Zachary|title=Haiti's President huddles privately with developers in Miami|url=http://www.michaelcapponi.com/web/press_awards.php?id=266|work=article|publisher=Miami Today|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004174453/http://www.michaelcapponi.com/web/press_awards.php?id=266|archivedate=2011-10-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Adams|first=David|title=The Pied Piper of Jacmel|url=http://www.podermagazine.com/article_detail.php?id_article=5670|work=Magazine|publisher=Poder|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120909052610/http://www.podermagazine.com/article_detail.php?id_article=5670|archivedate=2012-09-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This initiative was created to help stimulate a self-sustaining tourism economy for Haiti.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Pied Piper of Jacmel|url=http://www.podermagazine.com/article_detail.php?id_article=5670|work=Poder Magazine|publisher=Poder|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120909052610/http://www.podermagazine.com/article_detail.php?id_article=5670|archivedate=2012-09-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Capponi, founder of the Capponi Group, formed the [https://archive.is/20120728134546/http://www.discoveringhaiti.com/team/ Jacmel Advisory Council] to help revitalize Jacmel, while preserving its arts, culture and traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jacmel Advisory Council|url=http://www.discoveringhaiti.com/team/|publisher=Discoveringhaiti.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120728134546/http://www.discoveringhaiti.com/team/|archivedate=2012-07-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The board promotes best practices to provide a socio-economic system for thousands of Haitians living in the southeast region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schaaf|first=Bryan|title=Envisioning a New Jacmel|url=http://www.haitiinnovation.org/en/2011/05/30/envisioning-new-jacmel|work=Haiti Innovation|publisher=haitiinnovation.com|accessdate=May 29, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110602010335/http://www.haitiinnovation.org/en/2011/05/30/envisioning-new-jacmel|archivedate=June 2, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Capponi Group Haiti is also restoring a 200-year-old coffee-sorting house at the port of Jacmel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Haiti|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/thorntree/thread.jspa?threadID=2069022|work=forum|publisher=Lonely Planet}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project hopes to again make Jacmel a commercial and tourist center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Adams|first=David|title=Man with Plan, for Haiti|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2011/06/14/2265213/man-with-plan-for-haiti.html|work=Miami Herald|publisher=The Miami Herald|accessdate=June 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While earlier Jewish immigrants from Germany tended to be politically conservative, the wave of Eastern European Jews, starting in the early 1880s, were generally more liberal or left-wing, and became the political majority.&lt;ref name="Hasia Diner 2004"&gt;[[Hasia Diner]], ''The Jews of the United States. 1654 to 2000'' (2004), ch 5&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the latter came to America with experience in the [[socialism|socialist]], [[Jewish Anarchism|anarchist]], and [[communism|communist]] movements as well as the [[General Jewish Labor Union|Labor Bund]], emanating from Eastern Europe. Many Jews rose to leadership positions in the early 20th century [[American labor movement]], and helped to found unions that played a major role in left-wing politics and, after 1936, in [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] politics.&lt;ref name="Hasia Diner 2004"/&gt;  For most of the 20th century since 1936, the vast majority of Jews in the United States have been aligned with the Democratic Party. Towards the end of the 20th century, and at the beginning of the 21st century, Republicans have launched initiatives to woo American Jews away from the Democratic Party.

Over the past century, Jews in Europe and the Americas have traditionally tended towards the [[left-wing politics|political left]], and played key roles in the birth of the [[labor movement]] as well as [[socialism]]. While Diaspora Jews have also been represented in the [[conservatism|conservative]] side of the political spectrum, even politically conservative Jews have tended to support [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]] more consistently than many other elements of the [[right-wing politics|political right]].

The divide between right and left correlates to the various religious movements among Americans Jews. The more socially conservative movements in American Judaism (the Orthodox movement and various [[haredi]] sects, but not the Conservative movement) tend to be politically conservative, while the majority movements (Conservative, Reform, and Reconstructionist) tend to be more politically liberal or left-leaning. Level of religious observance is not a significant factor in Jewish political affiliation; there are highly-observant Jews in all of the major movements of American Judaism.

There are also a number of Jewish secular organizations at the local, national, and international levels.  These organizations often play an important part in the Jewish community. Most of the largest groups, such as [[Hadassah]] and the United Jewish Communities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ujc.org/ |title=ujc.org |publisher=ujc.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; have an elected leadership. No one secular group represents the entire Jewish community, and there is often significant internal debate among Jews about the stances these organizations take on affairs dealing with the Jewish community as a whole, such as anti-Semitism and Israeli policies. In the United States and Canada today, the mainly secular [[United Jewish Communities]] (UJC), formerly known as the [[United Jewish Appeal]] (UJA), represents over 150 [[Jewish Federations]] and 400 independent communities across North America. Every major American city has its local "Jewish Federation", and many have sophisticated community centers and provide services, mainly health care-related. They raise record sums of money for [[philanthropy|philanthropic]] and [[humanitarian]] causes in North America and Israel. Other organizations such as the [[Anti-Defamation League]], [[American Jewish Congress]], [[American Jewish Committee]], [[American Israel Public Affairs Committee]], Zionist Organization of America, Americans for a safe Israel, [[B'nai B'rith]], and [[Agudath Israel of America|Agudath Israel]] represent different segments of the American Jewish community on a variety of issues.

==Progressive movement==

With the influx of Jews from Central and Eastern Europe many members of the Jewish community were attracted to labor and socialist movements and numerous Jewish newspapers such as [[The Forward|Forwerts]] and [[Morgen Freiheit]] had a socialist or communist orientation. Left wing organizations such as the [[Arbeter Ring]] and the [[Jewish People's Fraternal Order]] played an important part in Jewish community life until [[World War II]].

Liberal Jewish Americans were not just involved in nearly every important social movement, but in the forefront of promoting such issues as workers rights, civil rights, woman's rights, gay rights, freedom of religion, freedom from religion, peace movements, and various other progressive causes.

==Presidential elections==
Although American Jews generally leaned Republican in the second half of the 19th century, the majority has voted Democratic or leftist since at least 1916, when they voted 55% for [[Woodrow Wilson]].&lt;ref name=JVLvote&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/US-Israel/jewvote.html|title=Jewish Vote In Presidential Elections|accessdate=2008-10-28|publisher= American-Israeli Cooperative Enterprise}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940 and 1944, 90% of American Jews voted for [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], and 75% voted for [[Harry S. Truman]] in 1948,&lt;ref name=JVLvote/&gt; despite both party platforms supporting the creation of a Jewish state in the latter two elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libarts.uco.edu/history/faculty/roberson/course/1493/supplements/chp26/26.%20Abba%20Silver.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120804111220/http://www.libarts.uco.edu/history/faculty/roberson/course/1493/supplements/chp26/26.%20Abba%20Silver.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-08-04 |title=Abba Hillel Silver |publisher=Libarts.uco.edu |date=2013-01-16 |accessdate=2013-09-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the 1952 and 1956 elections, they voted 60% or more for [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]], while [[Dwight Eisenhower|General Eisenhower]] garnered 40% for his reelection; the best showing to date for the Republicans since [[Warren G Harding|Harding's]] 43% in 1920.&lt;ref name=JVLvote/&gt; In 1960, 83% voted for Democrat [[John F. Kennedy]], the first [[Catholicism|Catholic]], versus [[Richard Nixon]], and in 1964, 90% of American Jews voted for [[Lyndon Johnson]]; his Republican opponent, arch-conservative [[Barry Goldwater]], was a Protestant with Jewish paternal grandparents.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Mark R. Levy and Michael S. Kramer, ''The Ethnic Factor'' (1973) p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Hubert Humphrey]] garnered 81% of the Jewish vote in the 1968 elections, in his losing bid for president against [[Richard Nixon]].&lt;ref name=JVLvote/&gt;

During the Nixon re-election campaign of 1972, Jewish voters were apprehensive about [[George McGovern]], and only favored the Democrat by 65%, while Nixon more than doubled Jewish support for Republicans to 35%. In the election of 1976, Jewish voters supported Democrat [[Jimmy Carter]] by 71% over incumbent president [[Gerald Ford]]'s 27%, but during the Carter re-election campaign of 1980, Jewish voters greatly abandoned the Democrat, with only 45% support, while Republican winner, [[Ronald Reagan]], garnered 39%, and 14% went to independent [[John B. Anderson|John Anderson]].&lt;ref name=JVLvote/&gt;&lt;ref name="voting"/&gt;

During the Reagan re-election campaign of 1984, the Republican retained 31% of the Jewish vote, while 67% voted for Democrat [[Walter Mondale]].  The 1988 election saw Jewish voters favor Democrat [[Michael Dukakis]] by 64%, while [[George H W Bush|George Bush Sr.]] polled a respectable 35%, but during his re-election in 1992, Jewish support dropped to just 11%, with 80%, voting for [[Bill Clinton]] and 9% going to independent [[Ross Perot]]. Clinton's re-election campaign in 1996 maintained high Jewish support at 78%, with 16% supporting [[Robert Dole]] and 3% for Perot.&lt;ref name=JVLvote/&gt;&lt;ref name=voting/&gt;

The elections of 2000 and 2004 saw continued Jewish support for Democrats [[Al Gore]] and [[John Kerry]], another Catholic candidate, remain in the high- to mid-70% range, while Republican [[George W Bush]]'s re-election in 2004 saw Jewish support rise from 19% to 24%.&lt;ref name=voting/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;.[http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/pages/results/states/US/P/00/epolls.0.html 2004 exit polls at [[CNN]]]&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 presidential election]], [[Joe Lieberman]] became the first Jewish American to run for national office on a major party ticket when he was chosen as Democratic presidential candidate [[Al Gore]]'s vice-presidential nominee.

In the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential election]], 78% of Jews voted for [[Barack Obama]], who became the first [[African-Americans|African-American]] to be elected president.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jta.org/news/article/2008/11/05/1000800/op-ed-why-jews-voted-for-obama OP-ED: Why Jews voted for Obama] by Marc Stanley, [[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]] (JTA), November 5, 2008 (retrieved on December 6, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; Polls indicate during this election, 83% of "white" Jews voted for Obama compared to just 34% of white Protestants and 47% of white Catholics, though 67% of those identifying with another religion and 71% identifying with no religion also voted Obama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/results/polls/#val=USP00p2 |title=CNN Exit Poll |publisher=Cnn.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[2012 presidential election]], 68% of Jews voted for Barack Obama.

==United States Congress==
For Congressional and Senate races, since 1968, American Jews have voted about 70%-80% for Democrats;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=F.

==Civil rights==
During the American Civil War, Jews were divided in their views of slavery and abolition. Prior to 1861, there were virtually no rabbinical sermons on slavery. The silence on this issue was probably a result of fear that the controversy would create conflict within the Jewish community. Jews were pivotal in ending slavery. Some Jews owned slaves or traded them, and the livelihoods of many in the Jewish community of both the North and South were tied to the slave system. Most southern Jews supported slavery, and some, like [[Judah P. Benjamin]], advocated its expansion. The abolitionist Ben Wade, who knew Benjamin in the U.S. Senate, described him as "an Israelite with Egyptian principles". Northern Jews sympathized with the South, and very few were abolitionists, seeking peace and remaining silent on the subject of slavery. America's largest Jewish community, New York's Jews, were "overwhelmingly pro-southern, pro-slavery, and anti-Lincoln in the early years of the war". However, eventually, they began to lean politically toward "Father Abraham", his Republican party, and emancipation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forward.com/articles/179441/jews-mostly-supported-slavery-or-kept-silent-d/?p=all Jews Mostly Supported Slavery — Or Kept Silent — During Civil War] The Jewish Daily Forward, 5 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the beginning of the 20th century, many American Jews have been very active in fighting prejudice and discrimination, and have historically been active participants in [[movements for civil rights]], including active support of and participation in the [[Civil Rights Movement]], active support of and participation in the labor rights movement, and active support of and participation in the [[women's rights movement]].

[[Seymour Siegel]] suggests that the historic struggle against prejudice faced by Jews led to a natural sympathy for any people confronting discrimination. Joachim Prinz, president of the [[American Jewish Congress]], stated the following when he spoke from the podium at the Lincoln Memorial during the famous [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom|March on Washington]] on August 28, 1963: "As Jews, we bring to this great demonstration, in which thousands of us proudly participate, a twofold experience - one of the spirit and one of our history ... From our Jewish historic experience of three and a half thousand years, we say: Our ancient history began with slavery and the yearning for freedom. During the Middle Ages, my people lived for a thousand years in the ghettos of Europe ... It is for these reasons that it is not merely sympathy and compassion for the black people of America that motivates us. It is, above all and beyond all such sympathies and emotions, a sense of complete identification and solidarity born of our own painful historic experience."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joachimprinz.com/civilrights.htm |title=Joachim Prinz March on Washington Speech |publisher=Joachimprinz.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crmvet.org/info/mowprog.htm |title=Veterans of the Civil Rights Movement - March on Washington |publisher=Crmvet.org |date=1963-08-28 |accessdate=2013-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International affairs==
[[File:Synagogue D-Day3.jpg|thumb|[[Normandy Landings|D-Day]] services at Congregation Emunath Israel on West Twenty-third Street, New York City]]
American Jews (and Jews worldwide) began taking a special interest in international affairs in the early twentieth century, especially regarding their co-religionists persecution during [[pogrom]]s in [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]], and later, regarding increasing restrictions on immigration in the 1920s. This period is also synchronous with the development of [[Streams of Zionism|political Zionism]], as well as the [[Balfour Declaration of 1917|Balfour Declaration]], which gave Zionism its first official recognition.

During the 1930s, large-scale boycotts of German merchandise were organized; this period was synchronous with the rise of [[Fascism]] in Europe. [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s leftist domestic policies received strong Jewish support in the 1930s and 1940s, as did his foreign policies and the subsequent founding of the [[United Nations]]. Support for political Zionism in this period, although growing in influence, remained a distinctly minority opinion. The founding of [[Israel]] in 1948 made the [[Middle East]] a center of attention; the immediate recognition of Israel by the American government was an indication of both its intrinsic support and the influence of political Zionism.

This attention initially was based on a natural and religious affinity toward, and support for, Israel and world Jewry. The attention is also because of the ensuing and unresolved conflicts regarding the founding Israel and Zionism itself. A lively internal debate commenced, following the [[Six-Day War]]. The American Jewish community was divided over whether or not they agreed with the Israeli response; the great majority came to accept the war as necessary. A tension existed especially for leftist Jews, between their liberal ideology and (rightist) Zionist backing in the midst of this conflict. This deliberation about the Six-Day War showed the depth and complexity of Jewish responses to the varied events of the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Staub (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Similar tensions were aroused by the 1977 election of Begin and the rise of [[Revisionist Zionism|revisionist]] policies, the [[1982 Lebanon War]], and the continuing occupation of the West Bank and Gaza.&lt;ref&gt;Roberta Strauss Feuerlicht. "The Fate of the Jews, A people torn between Israeli Power and Jewish Ethics". Times Books, 1983. {{ISBN|0-8129-1060-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disagreement over Israel's 1993 acceptance of the [[Oslo Accords]] caused a further split among American Jews;&lt;ref&gt;Danny Ben-Moshe, Zohar Segev, Israel, the Diaspora, and Jewish Identity, Published by Sussex Academic Press, 2007, {{ISBN|1-84519-189-7}}, Chapter 7, The Changing Identity of American Jews, Israel and the Peace Process, by Ofira Seliktar, p. 126 [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=1bXETKMOI1cC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA124&amp;dq=lobbies+Congress+to+slow+the+peace+process.+Their+allies+are+mostly+Republicans&amp;ots=JMqdkm1fzo&amp;sig=q2gD-JsQoqjyl3nomo4apnWbNhQ].
&lt;blockquote&gt; The 1993 Oslo Agreement made this split in the Jewish community official. Prime Minister Yitzak Rabin's handshake with Yasir Arafat during the 13 September White House ceremony elicited dramatically opposed reactions among American Jews. To the liberal universalists, the accord was highly welcome news. As one commentator put it, after a year of tension between Israel and the United States, "there was an audible sigh of relief from American and Jewish liberals. Once again, they could support Israel as good Jews, committed liberals, and loyal Americans." The community "could embrace the Jewish state, without compromising either its liberalism or its patriotism". Hidden deeper in this collective sense of relief was the hope that, following the peace with the Palestinians, Israel would transform itself into a Western-style liberal democracy, featuring a full separation between the state and religion. Not accidentally, many of the leading advocates of Oslo, including Yossi Beilin, the then-Deputy Foreign Minister, cherish the belief that a "normalized" Israel would become less Jewish and more democratic.

However, to the hard-core Zionists - the Orthodox community and right-wing Jews - the peace treaty amounted to what some dubbed the "handshake earthquake". From the perspective of the Orthodox, Oslo was not just an affront to the sanctity of Eretz Yisrael, but also a personal threat to the Orthodox settlers - often kin or former congregants - in the West Bank and Gaza. For Jewish nationalists such as Morton Klein, the president of the Zionist organization of America, and Norman Podhoretz, the editor of Commentary, the peace treaty amounted to an appeasement of Palestinian terrorism. They and others repeatedly warned that the newly established Palestinian Authority (PA) would pose a serious security threat to Israel.&lt;/blockqoute&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This mirrored a similar split among Israelis, and led to a parallel rift within the [[Israel lobby in the United States|pro-Israel lobby]].&lt;ref&gt;Danny Ben-Moshe, Zohar Segev, Israel, the Diaspora, and Jewish Identity, Sussex Academic Press, 2007, {{ISBN|1-84519-189-7}}, Chapter 7, The Changing Identity of American Jews, Israel and the Peace Process, by Ofira Seliktar, p. 126
&lt;blockquote&gt;Abandoning any pretense of unity, both segments began to develop separate advocacy and lobbying organizations. The liberal supporters of the Oslo Accord worked through Americans for Peace Now (APN), Israel Policy Forum (IPF), and other groups friendly to the Labour government in Israel. They tried to assure Congress that American Jewry was behind the Accord, and defended the efforts of the administration to help the fledgling Palestinian authority (PA), including promises of financial aid. In a battle for public opinion, IPF commissioned a number of polls showing widespread support for Oslo among the community.

Working on the other side of the fence, a host of Orthodox groups, such as ZOA, Americans For a Safe Israel (AFSI), and the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs (JINSA), launched a major public opinion campaign against Oslo. On 10 October 1993, the opponents of the Palestinian-Israeli accord, organized at the American Leadership Conference for a Safe Israel, where they warned that Israel was prostrating itself before a "an armed thug", and predicted that the "thirteenth of September is a date that will live in infamy". Hard-core Zionists also criticized, often in harsh language, Prime Minister Rabin and Shimon Peres, his foreign minister and chief architect of the peace accord. With the community so strongly divided, AIPAC and the Presidents Conference, which was tasked with representing the national Jewish consensus, struggled to keep the increasingly shrill discourse civil. Reflecting these tensions, Abraham Foxman from the Jewish Anti-Defamation League was forced by the conference to apologize for bad mouthing ZOA's Klein. The Conference, which under its organizational guidelines was in charge of moderating communal discourse, reluctantly censured some Orthodox spokespeople for attacking Colette Avital, the labor-appointed Israel Council General in New York and an ardent supporter of the peace process.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Middle East Review of International Affairs, Journal, Volume 6, No. 1 - March 2002, [http://meria.idc.ac.il/journal/2002/issue1/jv6n1a7.html Scott Lasensky, Underwriting Peace in the Middle East: U.S. Foreign Policy and the Limits of Economic Inducements] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020422101455/http://meria.idc.ac.il/journal/2002/issue1/jv6n1a7.html |date=April 22, 2002 }}
&lt;blockquote&gt; The Palestinian aid effort was certainly not helped by the heated debate that quickly developed inside the Beltway. Not only was the Israeli electorate divided on the Oslo accords, but so, too, was the American Jewish community, particularly at the leadership level and among the major New York and Washington-based public interest groups. U.S. Jews opposed to Oslo teamed up with Israelis "who brought their domestic issues to Washington", and together they pursued a campaign that focused most of its attention on Congress and the aid program. The dynamic was new to Washington. The Administration, the Rabin-Peres government, and some American Jewish groups teamed on one side, while Israeli opposition groups and anti-Oslo American Jewish organizations pulled Congress in the other direction.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2004 poll indicated that a majority of Jewish Americans favored the creation of an independent [[Palestinian state]] and believed that Israel should remove some or all of its settlements from the West Bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tomgrossmedia.com/mideastdispatches/archives/000069.html |title=Mideast Dispatch Archive: Iraq war leads Jewish voters to Kerry, poll finds (and other items) |publisher=Tomgrossmedia.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though some felt that Israeli security was among the motivations for American intervention in Iraq, Jews were less supportive of the [[Iraq War]] than Americans as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishaz.com/issues/story.mv?051223+poll]&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of the conflict, [[Arab Americans]] were more supportive of the Iraq War than American Jews were (although both groups were less supportive of it than the general population).

Because of the emotional connection many Jews have for Israel, the issue has generated strong passions among both left-wing and right-wing Jews. There is a significant Jewish presence in the disparate political movement known  as the "[[liberal hawks]]" or the [[pro-war Left]], which, while strongly committed to liberal or leftist social domestic policy, also supports a [[Liberal internationalism|liberal interventionist]], [[hawkish]] or right-wing pro-Israel [[foreign policy]] for the United States. (Examples include [[Joe Lieberman]], [[Christopher Hitchens]], many of the contributors to [[Dissent (American magazine)|''Dissent'' magazine]], and many of the signatories of the [[Euston Manifesto]].) At the same time, there is a significant Jewish presence in the pro-Palestinian movement seeking a [[two-state solution]], including [[Norman Finkelstein]], [[Noam Chomsky]], [[Judith Butler]], and key UK advocates of an [[academic boycotts of Israel|academic boycott of Israel]] like [[Stephen Rose|Stephen]] and [[Hilary Rose (academic)|Hilary Rose]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Stephen Hawking's boycott hits Israel where it hurts: science|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/political-science/2013/may/13/stephen-hawking-boycott-israel-science|accessdate=4 January 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=13 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "[[Israel lobby in the United States|Israel lobby]]" is the diverse coalition of groups and individuals seeking to influence the [[foreign policy of the United States]] in support of Zionism, [[Israel]] or the specific policies of its elected government.&lt;ref name=MearsheimerWaltLRB&gt;[[John Mearsheimer|Mearsheimer, John J.]] and [[Stephen Walt|Walt, Stephen]].

These groups have reportedly increased in size and influence over the years. The term itself has been subject to debate and criticism over the years, concerning its clarity and exact definition.

==Contemporary politics==
Today, American Jews are a distinctive and influential group in the nation's politics. Jeffrey S. Helmreich writes that the ability of American Jews to affect this through political or financial clout is overestimated,&lt;ref&gt;Steven L. Spiegel, ''The Other Arab-Israeli Conflict'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1985), pp. 150–165.&lt;/ref&gt; and that the primary influence lies in the group's voting patterns.&lt;ref name=voting&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jcpa.org/jl/vp446.htm|title=THE ISRAEL SWING FACTOR: HOW THE AMERICAN JEWISH VOTE INFLUENCES U.S. ELECTIONS |author=Jeffrey S. Helmreich|accessdate=2008-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Jews have devoted themselves to politics with almost religious fervor", writes [[Mitchell Bard]], who adds that Jews have the highest percentage voter turnout of any ethnic group. While 2–2.5% of the United States population is Jewish, 94% live in 13 key [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral college]] states, which combined have enough electors to elect the president.&lt;ref name=lobby&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/US-Israel/lobby.html|title=The Israeli and Arab Lobbies|author=Mitchell Bard|publisher=The American-Israeli Cooperative Enterprise|accessdate=2008-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rabbi&gt;{{cite news|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/politics/2008-09-16-964127071_x.htm|title=Family ties: Obama counts rabbi among relatives|author=Sophia Tareem|accessdate=2008-09-22|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the majority (60–70%) of the country's Jews identify as Democratic, Jews span the political spectrum, and Helmreich describes them as "a uniquely swayable bloc" as a result of Republican stances on [[Israel]].&lt;ref name=voting /&gt;&lt;ref name=rabbi /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.njdc.org/media/entry/busting_the_myth_jews_remain_democrats_new_independent_polling_shows|title=Busting the Myth: Jews Remain Democrats, New Independent Polling Shows|accessdate=2008-10-02|publisher=National Jewish Democratic Council}}&lt;/ref&gt; A paper by Dr. Eric Uslaner of the University of Maryland disagrees, at least with regard to the 2004 election: "Only 15% of Jews said that Israel was a key voting issue. Among those voters, 55% voted for Kerry (compared to 83% of Jewish voters not concerned with Israel)." The paper goes on point out that negative views of Evangelical Christians had a distinctly negative impact for Republicans among Jewish voters, while Orthodox Jews, traditionally more conservative in outlook as to social issues, favored the Republican Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bsos.umd.edu/gvpt/uslaner/uslanerlichbachjewishvotingbehaviorsummary.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=June 15, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615202225/http://www.bsos.umd.edu/gvpt/uslaner/uslanerlichbachjewishvotingbehaviorsummary.pdf |archivedate=June 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''New York Times'' article suggests that the Jewish movement to the Republican party is focused heavily on faith-based issues, similar to the Catholic vote, which is credited for helping President Bush taking Florida in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/05/politics/campaign/05religion.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=2&amp;oref=slogin |work=The New York Times |title=Bush Benefits From Efforts to Build a Coalition of the Faithful |date=2004-11-05 |accessdate=2010-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though critics have charged that Jewish interests were partially responsible for the push to war with Iraq, Jewish Americans are actually more strongly opposed to the [[Iraq War]] than any other major religious group or even most Americans. The greater opposition to the war is not simply a result of high Democratic identification among U.S. Jews, as Jews of all political persuasions are more likely to oppose the war than non-Jews who share the same political leanings. The widespread Jewish opposition to the war in Iraq is also not simply a matter of the majority of Americans now also opposing the war because the majority of Jews already opposed the war in 2003 and 2004 when most Americans did not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/26677/Among-Religious-Groups-Jewish-Americans-Most-Strongly-Oppose-War.aspx|title=Among Religious Groups, Jewish Americans Most Strongly Oppose War|publisher=Gallup, Inc. |author=Jeffrey M.

Owing to high Democratic identification in the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 United States presidential election]], 78% of Jews voted for Democrat [[Barack Obama]], versus 21% for Republican [[John McCain]], despite Republican attempts to connect Obama to Muslim and pro-Palestinian causes.&lt;ref name="78%" /&gt; It has been suggested that running mate [[Sarah Palin]]'s conservative views on social issues may have nudged Jews away from the McCain-Palin ticket.&lt;ref name=voting /&gt;&lt;ref name="78%"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3618408,00.html|title= 78% of American Jews vote Obama|author=Yitzhak Benhorin|publisher=Yedioth Internet|accessdate=2008-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Obama's chief strategist, [[David Axelrod (political consultant)|David Axelrod]], is Jewish, as is his former [[Chief of Staff]], [[Rahm Emanuel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/uselection2008/2017043/Barack-Obama-tells-Jewish-voters-of-his-support-for-Israel.html |title=Barack Obama tells Jewish voters of his support for Israel |accessdate=2008-11-06 |publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited 2008 |location=London |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080626052040/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/uselection2008/2017043/Barack-Obama-tells-Jewish-voters-of-his-support-for-Israel.html |archivedate=2008-06-26 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

American Jews are largely supportive of [[gay rights]], though a split exists within the group by observance. [[Reform Judaism|Reform]], [[Reconstructionist Judaism|Reconstructionist]], Jews are far more supportive on issues like gay marriage than [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jews]] are.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewsonfirst.org/howjewsseegr.html |title=Attacks on Gay Rights: How Jews See It |publisher=Jewsonfirst.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2007 survey of Conservative Jewish leaders and activists showed that an overwhelming majority now supports gay rabbinical ordination and same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forward.com/articles/9989/|title=Poll: Conservative Leaders Back Gay Rabbis|author=Rebecca Spence|accessdate=2009-04-23|publisher=Forward Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, 78% percent of Jewish voters rejected [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|Proposition 8]], the bill which banned gay marriage in California. No other ethnic or religious group voted as strongly against it.&lt;ref name=gaymarriage&gt;{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2008/11/la-jews-overwhe.html|title=L.A.

Jews in America also overwhelmingly oppose current United States [[marijuana]] policy. Eighty-six percent of Jewish Americans opposed arresting non-violent marijuana smokers, compared to 61% for the population at large and 68% of all Democrats. Additionally, 85% of Jews in the United States opposed using federal law enforcement to close patient cooperatives for [[medical marijuana]] in states where medical marijuana is legal, compared to 67% of the population at large and 73% of Democrats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://norml.org/index.cfm?Group_ID=5052|title=Majority of Americans Oppose US Marijuana Policies|accessdate=2009-04-23|publisher=NORML}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2012 presidential election, support for Democrats fell by 9 percentage, while support for Republicans increased by the same percentage. The American Jewish vote for President Barack Obama fell from 78 percent to 69 percent in 2012. Obama's opponent in 2008, John McCain, received the support of 21 percent of Jewish, whereas Mitt Romney increased that share to 30 percent in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/214135-gop-sees-signs-of-jewish-voters-drifting-away-from-democrats&lt;/ref&gt;

Israelis favored Republican presidential candidate [[Mitt Romney]] over [[Barack Obama]] in the 2012 United States presidential election by a 57 percent to 22 percent margin.&lt;ref&gt;http://thehill.com/policy/international/264609-romney-polls-far-ahead-of-obama-in-israel&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bernie Sanders]] won the [[New Hampshire Democratic primary]] on February 9, 2016, by 22.4% of the vote (60.4% to [[Hillary Clinton]]'s 38.0%); he received strong support from voters who considered it important to nominate a candidate who is "honest and trustworthy".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2016/primaries/new-hampshire&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT02916"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Patrick Healy and Jonathan Martin|title=Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders Win the New Hampshire Primaries|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/10/us/politics/new-hampshire-primary.html|accessdate=February 10, 2016|work=The New York Times|date=February 10, 2016|quote= ...

The [[Bible]] has been [[translation|translated]] into [[Bible translations by language|many languages]] from the [[biblical languages]] of [[Biblical Hebrew|Hebrew]], [[Biblical Aramaic|Aramaic]] and [[Koine Greek|Greek]]. The Latin [[Vulgate]] translation was dominant in [[Western Christianity]] through the Middle Ages. Since then, the Bible has been translated into [[Bible translations by language|many more languages]]. [[English Bible translations]] also have a rich and varied history of more than a millennium.

Included when possible are dates and the source language(s) and, for incomplete translations, what portion of the text has been translated.  Certain terms that occur in many entries are linked at the bottom of the page.

Because different groups of Jews and Christians differ on the true content of the Bible, the "incomplete translations" section includes only translations seen by their translators as incomplete, such as Christian translations of the New Testament alone.  Translations such as Jewish versions of the [[Tanakh]] are included in the "complete" category, even though Christians traditionally have considered the Bible to consist properly of more than just the Tanakh.

| The RSV-2CE is a slight update of the 1966 Revised Standard Version - Catholic Edition.  It removes archaic pronouns (thee, thou) and accompanying verb forms (didst, speaketh), revises passages used in the lectionary according to the Vatican document Liturgiam authenticam and elevates some passages out of RSV footnotes when they reflect Catholic teaching. For instance, the RSV-2CE renders "almah" as "virgin" in Isaiah 7:14, restores the term "begotten" in John 3:16 and other verses, uses the phrase "full of grace" instead of "favored one" in Luke 1:28, and substitutes "mercy" for "steadfast love" (translated from the Hebrew hesed) throughout the Psalms. As with the original RSV, gender-neutral language is not used when it has no direct referent in original language of the text.

[[W. E. Johns|William Earl Johns]] (professionally known as W. E. Johns; 1893–1968) was an English writer and journalist. He wrote over 150 books and was, after [[Enid Blyton]], "the most prolific and popular children's writer of his time".{{sfn|Williams|Berresford Ellis|2008}} Most of Johns's work—102 books—consists of the stories of [[Biggles]], a [[First World War]] pilot and, later, adventurer, detective and [[Second World War]] [[squadron leader]]. He also wrote science fiction stories, and two further series of war stories, featuring the characters [[Worrals]] of the [[Women's Auxiliary Air Force|Women's Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF)]] and [[Captain Lorrington "Gimlet" King|Gimlet]], a [[British Commando]].{{sfn|Williams|Berresford Ellis|2008}}{{sfn|Schmidt|1995|pp=128–29}}

Johns served in the army during the First World War.{{efn|Johns was with the [[Norfolk Yeomanry]] at the start of the war, serving in the [[Gallipoli Campaign]], before he transferred to the [[Machine Gun Corps]] for service in [[Salonika]].{{sfn|Williams|Berresford Ellis|2008}}}}  In 1917 he was commissioned into the [[Royal Flying Corps]] (RFC) and saw action in Northern France. In September 1918 his aircraft was shot down and Johns, wounded, was captured by the Germans; he remained a prisoner until the end of the war, despite two attempts to escape. He remained with the RFC through its change into the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF), and served with them until 1927.{{sfn|Williams|Berresford Ellis|2008}}&lt;ref name="Gage CA" /&gt;{{efn|Johns was the recruiting officer who signed [[T. E. Lawrence]] into the RAF. Although Johns wanted to reject the application because of the obviously false name given by Lawrence, he was ordered to accept the former soldier.{{sfn|Williams|Berresford Ellis|2008}}}}

On leaving the RAF he became a journalist and illustrator. In 1932 he founded ''Popular Flying'' magazine and became its first editor. He used the magazine to publish his Biggles short stories.&lt;ref name="Times: obit" /&gt;{{sfn|Wright|2001|pp=4–5}} Johns described Biggles as "typical of the type of British airman I knew during the Great War. His chief characteristics are courage, loyalty and sportsmanship."&lt;ref name="Times: obit" /&gt; He continued to publish his stories in periodicals and newspapers throughout his career. Six months after the first Biggles stories were published they were collected in book form in ''The Camels are Coming''.  During the Second World War, Johns worked for the [[Air Ministry]]; the ministry asked him to create a female character to boost recruitment into the [[Women's Auxiliary Air Force]], which resulted in the publication of the Worrals stories and books.{{sfn|Cadogan|1990|p=5}} The character was successful and the [[War Office]] requested Johns introduce a soldier, which led to the introduction of Gimlet.{{sfn|Williams|Berresford Ellis|2008}}

Johns also wrote eight non-fiction books, most of which related to flying and pilots, although a book on gardening and two children's books—''The Modern Boys Book of Pirates'' and ''The Biggles Book of Treasure Hunting''—were also published.

==Career==
Gallagher began her career, in the 1970s, researching the use of technology in education,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Gallagher | first = Margaret | title = Broadcast evaluation report number one: analysis M231 | publisher = [[Open University]] | location = Walton, Milton Keynes | date = August 1975 | url = http://eric.ed.gov/?q=author%3a%22margaret+gallagher%22&amp;id=ED119667  |oclc=424965558}} [http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED119667.pdf Pdf.] (Audio-Visual Media Research Group with Faculty of Mathematics.)&lt;/ref&gt; eventually becoming deputy head of the Audiovisual Media Research Group at the [[Open University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Advisors: Margaret Gallagher | url = http://www.ecrea.eu/board/advisory | publisher = [[ECREA – European Communication Research and Education Association|European Communication Research and Education Association (ECREA)]] | access-date = 19 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She moved into gender and media research, including participation rates and portrayal of women in the media, in the early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Gallagher | first = Margaret | title = The image reflected by mass media: stereotypes: images of women in the mass media | publisher = [[UNESCO]] | location = New York | year = 1980 | url = http://unesdoc.unesco.org/Ulis/cgi-bin/ulis.pl?catno=43179&amp;set=0056207A13_2_181&amp;gp=0&amp;lin=1&amp;ll=1  |oclc=23071662}} [http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0004/000431/043179eb.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986 Gallagher established the European Commission's Steering Committee for Equal Opportunities in Broadcasting, which she coordinated until 1990. From 1989 to 1999 she worked on the "Prix Niki", the European Commission's biennial television prize for innovative portrayal of women and men. She has also acted as a consultant to a consortium of five European broadcasters for the development of an audiovisual training kit Screening Gender (1997-2000), and to the [[World Association for Christian Communication|World Association for Christian Communication (WAAC)]] for the second [[The Global Media Monitoring Project|Global Media Monitoring Project (GMMP)]] (2000).&lt;ref name=SMTYEWTK /&gt;

In 2001, Gallagher became an associate of the [[Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press]] (WIFP).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wifp.org/who-we-are/associates/|title=Associates {{!}}  The Women’s Institute for Freedom of the Press|website=www.wifp.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gallagher is currently Key Expert on Media Monitoring for the European Neighbourhood Barometer project "Opinion Polling and Media Monitoring" ([[International Cooperation and Development|EuropeAid]], [[European Commission]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Carter | first1 = Cynthia | last2 = Steiner | first2 = Linda | last3 = McLaughlin | first3 = Lisa | author-link1 = Cynthia Carter | author-link2 = Linda Steiner | contribution = Contributors | editor-last1 = Carter | editor-first1 = Cynthia | editor-last2 = Steiner | editor-first2 = Linda | editor-last3 = McLaughlin | editor-first3 = Lisa | editor-link1 = Cynthia Carter | editor-link2 = Linda Steiner | title = The Routledge companion to media &amp; gender | publisher = Routledge | page = xiv | location = London New York | year = 2015 | isbn = 9781138849129 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20150801090454/http://euneighbourhood.eu/ Project details.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2018, Gallagher was one of 40 senior academics who wrote an open letter to ''[[The Guardian]]'' condemning what they called anti-[[Jeremy Corbyn|Corbyn]] bias in media coverage of [[Antisemitism in the Labour Party|the antisemitism debate]] saying it was "framed in such a way as to mystify the real sources of [[Antisemitism|anti-Jewish]] bigotry and to weaponise it against a single political figure just ahead of [[United Kingdom local elections, 2018|important elections]]."&lt;ref name="theguardian"&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/02/stop-jeremy-corbyns-trial-by-media-over-antisemitism|title=Stop Jeremy Corbyn’s trial by media over antisemitism|work= |location= |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|date=2 April 2018|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Maritime Archaeology Sea Trust''' (MAST) is a [[charitable trust]] founded in February 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thisismast.org |title=Maritime Archaeology Sea Trust |publisher=Thisismast.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; which focuses on investigations into the maritime heritage of the [[United Kingdom]] and further afield, through [[maritime history|historical]] and [[maritime archaeology|archaeological investigations]]. MAST uses its profits from contract work as well as donations to fund its charitable aims.

Its stated objective is to advance the education of the public in maritime heritage, focusing in particular on maritime archaeological material. By such means as the directors in their discretion shall from time to time think fit including the preservation and investigation of shipwrecked vessels and of historically or otherwise valuable maritime material and the dissemination of the educationally useful results of such investigation to the general public. It does this by conducting archaeological surveys and excavations, conservation of material and publication of results. Clients include [[Historic England]], the Ministry of Defence and the [[National Trust]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/salcombe-to-hope-cove/things-to-see-and-do/view-page/item535880/ |title=North and South Sands canoe trail, Salcombe |publisher=National Trust |date= |accessdate=2014-01-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102193743/http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/salcombe-to-hope-cove/things-to-see-and-do/view-page/item535880/ |archivedate=2 January 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

MAST is also accredited to the Governing Bodies of the 2001 UNESCO Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/underwater-cultural-heritage/partners-society/partners-ngos/accredited-ngos/ |title=Accredited Non-Governmental Organisations |publisher=UNESCO |date= 2015 |accessdate=2016-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is a signatory to the Armed Forces Covenant which is committed to honour and to support the Armed Forces community of the United Kingdom&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/499917/Maritime_Archaeology_Sea_Trust_Armed_Forces_Covenant_20160113.pdf |title=The Armed Forces Corporate Covenant |publisher=Ministry of Defence |date= 2016 |accessdate=2016-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Projects==

MAST takes a holistic approach to maritime archaeology covering a wide range of methods and environments including geophysics (both on land and sea), excavations, surveys, conservation and desk-based research.

===HMS Invincible 1744===
In July 2016 MAST received a £2 million grant for the rescue excavation, recovery, conservation and public display of material from the wreck of [[HMS Invincible (1747)]] with partners [[Bournemouth University]], [[National Museum of the Royal Navy]], Dan Pascoe of Pascoe Archaeological Services and Serving and ex-Service volunteers and the Community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/libor-fines-to-be-used-to-support-military-charities-and-royal-voluntary-service| title=LIBOR fines to be used to support military charities and Royal Voluntary Service|publisher=HM Treasury|date= 2016-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chancellor [[George Osborne]] said: "The wreck of the HMS Invincible is an invaluable part of the UK's proud maritime history and it is important we work to save as much as possible. This hugely worthwhile project will support military veterans, serving personnel and disadvantaged teenagers to learn new skills and put artefacts from the wreck on public display for the first time".

The site was first found in 1979 by Arthur Mack. John Bingeman subsequently led excavations between 1980-90 (Bingeman 2010). Dan Pascoe of Pascoe Archaeological Services took the reins in 2010, monitoring the increasingly vulnerable site, undertaking extensive survey work and raising artefacts at risk from destruction, work funded by [[Historic England]]. It was this that led Historic England to recognise the site's vulnerability.

[[Chatham Historic Dockyard]] holds a significant collection of HMS Invincible artefacts. Maritime archaeological material from the 18th century is poorly represented as a whole in the UK considering the amount of wrecks of this era off our coasts. The HMS Invincible 1744 Project will vastly increase our knowledge and understanding of this important era in shipbuilding and ship life.&lt;ref&gt;http://thedockyard.co.uk/explore/command-of-the-ocean/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Esmeralda 1503===
Following the discovery of a site consistent with an early 16th-century European wreck off [[Al-Hallaniyah]] in 1998, the Omani government, spearheaded by its Ministry of Heritage and Culture, agreed to initially to a reconnaissance expedition in 2013. [[David Mearns]], director of Blue Water Recoveries, brought together a team of maritime archaeologists from MAST and Bournemouth University, geophysicists and other scientists in 2013 to conduct a reconnaissance survey of the site, 14 years after its initial discovery. The archaeology team, led by Associate Professor Dave Parham of Bournemouth University, was supported by MAST which co-funded the first expedition in 2013. There have two subsequent fieldwork seasons and fieldwork was completed in November 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mearns|first1=David|last2=Parham|first2=Dave|last3=Frolich|first3=Bruno|title=A Portuguese East Indiaman from the 1502–1503 Fleet of Vasco da Gama off Al Hallaniyah Island, Oman: an interim report|journal=International Journal of Nautical Archaeology|date=14 March 2016|volume=46|issue=2|pages=1–21|doi=10.1111/1095-9270.12175|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1095-9270.12175/full|accessdate=1 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esmeraldashipwreck.com/history/|title=Vasco da Gama shipwreck history following find of Esmeralda Shipwreck off Oman coast|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Royal Navy Loss List===
As part of a team undertaking the 2001 [[UNESCO]] Convention Impact Review for the United Kingdom, MAST completed the [[Royal Navy]] Loss List, a major assessment of the international spread of UK sovereign wrecks.

The RN Loss List, from 1512-1947, is compiled from the volumes and websites listed below from the earliest known RN wreck. The assessment shows that there are over 4,700 Royal Naval wrecks scattered across the oceans of the world, covering the period between 1512 and 1945.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rmg.co.uk/discover/researchers/research-guides/research-guide-b3-royal-navy-sources-enquiries&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/underwater-cultural-heritage/about-the-underwater-cultural-heritage/world-war-i/heritage-for-peace-education-initiative/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coronation Geophysical Survey===
A Geophysical Survey was conducted by MAST and the Cornwall and Isles of Scilly Maritime Archaeological Society (CISMAS) on the [[HMS Coronation (1685)|Coronation Protected Wreck Site]]. Promare UK was sub-contracted to conduct the magnetometer survey and Swathe Services to conduct a multibeam survey producing a site plan of geo-referenced targets of both designated sites and the Intermediate area.

The Coronation was a 90-gun second rate, built in 1685 by Isaac Betts at Portsmouth dockyard as one of the 1677 thirty-ships programme. On 3 September 1691 after patrolling for the French fleet, the English Fleet made for Plymouth. The Coronation foundered in a strong south easterly gale whilst trying to round Penlee Point with a loss of all but 13 of her crew, including the captain, Charles Skelton.

The Coronation Protected wreck site consists of two designated areas: Inshore (designated 1988) &amp; Offshore (designated 1978). The area in between these two protected sites is known as the "Intermediate" site wherein lies an unverified scatter of archaeological material.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thisismast.org/downloads/CoronationWebReport.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bamburgh Castle Beach Wreck===
A rarely seen portion of an unknown wreck within the intertidal zone of [[Bamburgh Castle]] Beach was reported to MAST by Steve Brown, a PADI Basic Archaeological Diver (BAD) Instructor and local historian. MAST has conducted two preliminary surveys of the site in 2013 to establish the extent of the site and how much remains under the sand.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thisismast.org/downloads/bamburghcastle_v3.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The survival and position of some of the features within the wreck would suggest that the buried structure could be mostly intact as the position of hull structure, deck beams, masts and even deck fittings are all as would be expected from a mostly intact buried vessel.

[[Dendrochronology|Dendrochronological]] samples were taken as part of this survey to try and establish the date and origin of the vessel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.northumberlandgazette.co.uk/news/local-news/shipwreck-offers-unique-opportunity-for-study-1-6119465 |title=Shipwreck offers unique opportunity for study |publisher=Northumberland Gazette |date=2013-10-05 |accessdate=2014-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site is now protected under the [[Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979]].

===Swash Channel Wreck Artefacts===
MAST has donated funds to conserve three of the carvings from the [[Swash Channel Wreck]] as well as a [[Canister shot|canister]]

They were raised in August 2010. The two carvings were found directly above the gunports in the bowcastle and are in extremely good condition. They bring the number of carvings found on the site to five.

The work will be done by the [[York Archaeological Trust]]. Once conserved you will be able to see the artefacts up close at [[Poole Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisismast.org/projects.html |title=Maritime Archaeology Sea Trust : Swash Channel Wreck Artefacts |publisher=Thisismast.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scubaverse.com/2013/09/20/uk-minister-for-culture-ed-vaizey-visits-the-maritime-archaeology-sea-trust-mast/ |title=UK Minister For Culture Ed Vaizey Visits The York Archaeology Trust To View Marine Artefacts &amp;#124; Scubaverse &amp;#124; The World's Best Online Dive Companion |publisher=Scubaverse |date=2013-09-20 |accessdate=2014-01-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102191210/http://www.scubaverse.com/2013/09/20/uk-minister-for-culture-ed-vaizey-visits-the-maritime-archaeology-sea-trust-mast/ |archivedate=2 January 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-dorset-23602554 |title=BBC News - Poole Swash Channel Wreck: Raising the rudder |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2013-08-19 |accessdate=2014-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== MoD wrecks===
MAST, in partnership with [[Bournemouth University]], won a Ministry of Defence (MoD) contract to assess the environmental and safety risks posed by the tankers [[RFA Creosol]] (1916), [[RFA War Mehtar]] (1919) and the escort carrier [[HMS Dasher (D37)]]. This assessment includes research into the history of the wreck and its cargo/contents.

The ships fall into two broad groups, purpose-built tankers and an escort aircraft carrier converted from a merchant ship. The first two are relatively simple vessels and the third a much more complex vessel that is likely to be complicated by its conversion and change of use and reuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisismast.org/mod-wrecks.html |title=MoD wrecks |publisher=Thisismast.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Not for Profit==
MAST has conducted two major charity events off [[Plymouth Sound]]. One in 2012 and one in 2013. In September 2012 MAST raised £6,000 to raise awareness for maritime heritage in the UK and for the [[RNLI]]'s Plymouth branch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rnli.org/NewsCentre/Pages/Plymouth-RNLI-receives-%C2%A31000-donation.aspx |title=Plymouth RNLI receives £1,000 donation |publisher=Rnli.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2013, MAST raised money again to raise awareness for the need to protect UK maritime heritage but also for the charity [[Battle Back Challenge Centre|Battle Back]] which received £2,000 towards helping injured Service personnel in their rehabilitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Herald |first=Plymouth |url=http://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/Divers-delving-deep-help-injured-heroes/story-19672043-detail/story.html |title=Divers delving deep to help injured heroes |publisher=Plymouth Herald |date=2013-08-17 |accessdate=2014-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diving Speciality==
In 2012 MAST created a [[PADI]] Distinctive Specialty called Basic Archaeological Diver, a no frills, no fuss introduction to the basics of archaeology underwater with simple recording techniques using little more than a camera and tape measures.

'''Medical torture''' describes the involvement of, or sometimes instigation by, [[medical personnel]] in acts of [[torture]], either to judge what victims can endure, to apply treatments which will enhance torture, or as torturers in their own right. Medical torture overlaps with '''medical interrogation''' if it involves the use of professional medical expertise to facilitate [[interrogation]] or [[corporal punishment]], in the conduct of torturous [[human experimentation]] or in providing professional medical sanction and approval for the torture of prisoners. Medical torture also covers torturous scientific (or pseudo-scientific) experimentation upon unwilling human subjects.

==Medical ethics and international law==
It is generally accepted that medical torture fundamentally violates [[medical ethics]], which all medical practitioners are expected to adhere to.
* The [[Hippocratic Oath]] makes explicit statements against deliberate harm not in the patient's best interests. These statements are often translated as ''"I will prescribe regimens for the good of my patients according to my ability and my judgment"'' and ''"to never deliberately do harm to anyone, for anyone else's interest."'' (Note: these statements are formulations of the ethical principles of [[beneficence (ethics)|beneficence]] and [[non-maleficence]].)
* In response to the [[Nazi human experimentation]] on prisoners during [[World War II]], which were declared at the post-World War II [[Nuremberg Trials]] to be "[[crimes against humanity]]", the [[World Medical Association]] developed the [[Declaration of Geneva]] to supplant the dated Hippocratic Oath. The Declaration of Geneva requires medical practitioners to state "&lt;nowiki&gt;[I, the medical practitioner]&lt;/nowiki&gt; will maintain the utmost respect for human life from its beginning even under threat and I will not use my medical knowledge contrary to the laws of humanity."
* The Nuremberg Trials also led to the emergence of the [[Nuremberg code]] which explicitly outlines the boundaries of acceptable medical experimentation.
* Additionally in response to the [[Nazi atrocities]], the [[Geneva Convention]]s of 1949 outright prohibits the torture of [[prisoners of war]] and other protected [[non-combatants]].
* The [[World Medical Association]] [[Declaration of Tokyo (1975)]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/tokyo.html&lt;/ref&gt; makes a number of specific statements against torture, including "The doctor shall not ''countenance'', ''condone'' or ''participate in'' the practice of torture".
* Also the [[UN Convention Against Torture]], which also applies to medical personnel (in addition to [[law enforcement officers]], [[military personnel]], [[politicians]], and other persons acting in an [[official capacity]]), prohibits the use of torture under any circumstance. Under Article 2(2) of the Convention, it states that "No exceptional circumstances whatsoever, whether a state of [[war]] or a threat of war, internal [[Failed state|political instability]] or any other [[State of Emergency|public emergency]], may be invoked as a justification of torture."
* The UN Principles of Medical Ethics relevant to the Role of Health Personnel, particularly Physicians, in the Protection of Prisoners and Detainees against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (UN.1982) applies specifically to medical and other health workers but it has no implementation mechanism to ensure enforcement. It is up to state, provincial, and national bodies to enforce the standards in the document.
* The development of [[command responsibility]] established [[legal liability|criminal liability]] for all people, including physicians, involved in crimes against humanity.

There remain gaps in regulation relating to medical torture in many countries:

*  Government sponsored torture and organized violence, with the complicity and or participation of health personnel, is internationally prohibited yet these violations occur with impunity in a significant amount of cases. An example of this impunity is found in the [[Abu Ghraib|Abu Ghraib prison]] torture and prisoner scandal as well as documented by [[Amnesty International]].
* A higher standard of behaviour is expected of health professionals yet the [[UN Principles of Medical Ethics]] are not enforceable when governments are complicit in violations. This higher standard is reflected in the principles of beneficence, non-maleficence (above all do no harm), autonomy, justice, dignity and informed consent and these are not covered comprehensively by the [[UN Convention Against Torture]].

==Asserted instances==
* Between 1937 and 1945, Japanese medical personnel who were part of [[Unit 731]] participated in the torture killings of as many as 10,000 Chinese, Russian, American and other prisoners as well as Allied POWs during the [[Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945)|second Sino-Japanese War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aiipowmia.com/731/731caveat.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430115229/http://www.aiipowmia.com/731/731caveat.html |archivedate=2009-04-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* During [[World War II]], the [[Nazism|Nazi]] regime in Germany conducted [[Nazi human experimentation|human medical experimentation]] on large numbers of people held in its concentration camps. In particular, [[Josef Mengele]]'s experiments on prisoners at [[Auschwitz]] earned him the nicknames "the Angel of Death" and "Dr. Death".
* During [[World War II]], the [[Nazism|Nazi]] regime in Germany regularly executed prisoners and opponents of the regime. According to some accounts, medical staff was involved in torture during executions. One account of [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]]'s death states that, as doctor at [[Flossenbürg concentration camp]], "Fischer-Hüllstrung had the job of reviving political prisoners after they had been hanged until they were almost dead, in order to prolong the agony of their dying."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=2010|author=Ferdinand Schlingensiepen|isbn=0-7735-1531-3|title=Dietrich Bonhoeffer, 1906–1945: Martyr, Thinker, Man of Resistance|publisher=Continuum/T &amp; T Clark}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Japanese surgeons also performed [[vivisection]] and other medical experiments to torture [[United States|American]] prisoners of war in several islands of the Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.crimesofwar.org/a-z-guide/medical-experiments-on-pows/&lt;/ref&gt;
* Between 1970 and 1971, mentally disorienting interrogation techniques were used against interned prisoners captured in [[Northern Ireland]], including [[white noise]]. The Irish government complained to the [[European Commission for Human Rights]], who found Britain guilty of torture; however the higher [[European Court of Human Rights]] ruled that the British government's actions were "inhuman and degrading but did not constitute torture".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/war/troubles/origins/internment.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;
* In Soviet mental hospitals [[Punitive psychiatry in the Soviet Union|used to hold political prisoners]], very unpleasant medications were given to these "patients" as a means of punishment.  A psychiatric diagnosis was devised to describe people who oppose government policies.
* In 1978, "Pisaot menuh" ("Human Experiments") were performed on seventeen [[political prisoner]]s held at the infamous prison [[Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum|Tuol Sleng]] in [[Phnom Penh]] under the [[Khmer Rouge]].
* A study called "[[The Aversion Project]]" found that gay conscripts in the [[South African Defence Force]]s (SADF) during the [[apartheid]] era had been forced to submit to "curing" their homosexuality, both by electroshock therapies and by botched [[sex change]]s.
* There have been numerous claims that [[electroconvulsive therapy]] and [[Leukotomy|prefrontal lobotomies]] and similar psychiatric treatments have sometimes been performed not in the patient's best interests, but rather as punishment for misbehaviour or to otherwise make the patient easier to manage. A classic example of this is the Lake Alice, New Zealand atrocity which occurred in the early 1970s. Children admitted to the [[Lake Alice Hospital]]'s open child and adolescent unit were routinely punished with unmodified ECT (that is, [[electroconvulsive therapy#technique|ECT]] without anesthesia). Some governments (e.g. [[Norway]] and [[New Zealand]]) have since begun paying reparations to patients who suffered such treatments. The [[World Health Organization]] has called for a ban on unmodified ECT, and states no form of it should be used on children.
* In 2014, Howard S Schneider, a Jacksonville, Florida pediatric dentist (not to be confused with Howard W Schneider, a pediatric dentist practicing in New York), was accused of [[wikt:sadistic|sadistically]] torturing patients as young as 2. He avoided prosecution by claiming incompetence and is no longer practicing. &lt;ref name="Schneider"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstcoastnews.com/story/news/local/consumer/on-your-side/2015/05/07/lawsuit-filed-jacksonville-dentist/70950856/|title=Lawsuit alleges torture, abuse, fraud at local dentist's office}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2016, a group consisting of 71 British medical doctors urged that [[Israel]]'s membership in the [[World Medical Association]] should be revoked because Israeli doctors allegedly perform state-endorsed "medical torture" on Palestinians.&lt;ref name="israel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/British-doctors-seek-to-expel-Israel-from-World-Medical-Association-442215|title=British doctors seek to expel Israel from World Medical Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Asserted medical or professional complicity==
According to the [[Center for Constitutional Rights]]' When Healers Harm campaign, health professionals were complicit in the torture and abuse of detainees during U.S. President [[George W. Bush]]'s "[[war on terror]]".  Health professionals, including medical doctors, psychiatrists, medical examiners, psychologists, and nurses, have been implicated in the torture and abuse of prisoners in [[CIA]] secret prisons and military detention centers, such as those in [[Guantánamo Bay detention camp|Guantánamo]], [[Afghanistan]], and [[Iraq]].

Among other things, health professionals are accused of:

* crafting abusive tactics and falsely legitimizing their use;
* advised interrogators on methods of abuse that would exploit prisoners’ vulnerabilities;
* using medical procedures to harm prisoners;
* gauging [[pain]] and monitoring interrogations that risked leaving prisoners in need of treatment;
* checking prisoners to certify that they were capable of surviving additional abuse;
* conditioning medical or mental health treatment on cooperation with interrogation;
* sharing confidential patient information that was used to harm patients;
* covering up evidence of torture and abuse; and
* turning a blind eye to cruel treatment.

To date, no state licensing boards or professional associations have investigated – or recognized, in some cases – abusive conduct by individual members of their professions.  In 2009, after years of denial, the [[American Psychological Association]] finally recognized that psychologists had engaged in torture.  However, the American Psychological Association has not recognized that psychologists were involved in the Bush Administration’s torture policy.  Some criticize the [[American Psychological Association|APA]] for failing to respond to allegations of “collusion between APA officials and the national security apparatus in providing ethical cover for psychologists’ participation in detainee abuse."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psychoanalystsopposewar.org/blog/2009/06/29/open-letter-in-response-to-the-american-psychological-association-board/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090704035404/http://psychoanalystsopposewar.org/blog/2009/06/29/open-letter-in-response-to-the-american-psychological-association-board/ |archivedate=2009-07-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the [[American Medical Association]] has made clear that physicians should not be involved in interrogations of any kind, it continues to insist that it has “no specific knowledge of doctors being involved in abuse or torture,” despite evidence to the contrary, including government documents and [[Office of Legal Counsel]] memos, a report by the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] and multiple accounts by survivors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://armed-services.senate.gov/Publications/Detainee%20Report%20Final_April%2022%202009.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429200942/http://armed-services.senate.gov/Publications/Detainee%20Report%20Final_April%2022%202009.pdf |archivedate=2009-04-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aclu.org/safefree/general/olc_memos.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Some other accounts of medical or professional complicity in torture include:
*The SERE ("[[Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape]]") program's chief psychologist, Col. Morgan Banks, issued guidance in early 2003 for the "behavioral science consultants" who helped to devise [[Guantanamo Bay detainment camp|Guantánamo]]'s interrogation strategy although he has emphatically denied that he had advocated the use of SERE counter-resistance techniques to break down detainees. The ''New Yorker'' notes that in November, 2001 Banks was detailed to Afghanistan, where he spent four months at [[Bagram Air Base]], "supporting combat operations against Al Qaeda and Taliban fighters".
*Confidential medical records of [[Guantanamo Bay detainment camp|Guantánamo]] prisoners were used to identify physical and psychological weaknesses that could be exploited during abusive interrogation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hickman |first=John |year=2013 |title=Selling Guantánamo |location=Gainesville |publisher=University Press of Florida |pages=180–181}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A 2005 report by [[Human Rights Watch]] suggested that torture was routine under the appointed Iraqi government.&lt;ref&gt;http://hrw.org/reports/2005/iraq0105/&lt;/ref&gt;
* Dr. [[J.C. Carothers]], British colonial Kenyan psychiatrist, has been implicated by some recent academic historians in designing interrogation of [[Mau Mau]] prisoners.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} His advice was published by the Kenya Government as The Psychology of Mau Mau, in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;For discussion of Carothers involvement with [[Mau Mau]] in Kenya in the 1950s: {{cite book |last=McCulloch |first=Jock |year=1995 |title=Colonial Psychiatry and "the African Mind" |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=FToFMwnBacQC&amp;pg=PA64 64–74]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Similarly, it has been implied that Interim [[Iraq]]i Prime Minister Dr. [[Ayad Allawi]] violated his obligation to medical ethics whilst serving as Western European chief of [[secret police]] for the [[Ba'ath Party|Baath]]ist government of [[Saddam Hussein]]. However, the same sources allege that Allawi had abandoned his medical education at that point and his medical degree "was conferred upon him by the Baath party."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/?040628fa_fact&lt;/ref&gt;

==In fiction==
* Actor [[Michael Palin]] plays a medical torturer in Director [[Terry Gilliam]]'s 1985 dark comedic dystopian film ''[[Brazil (1985 film)|Brazil]]''.
* In the film adaptation of [[George Orwell]]'s [[Nineteen Eighty-Four]] the main character, [[Winston Smith]], is subjected to medical torture by the [[thought police]].

* The film ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (film)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]]'', starring [[Jack Nicholson]], depicts abuse of psychiatric techniques including [[electroconvulsive therapy]] and [[lobotomy]].
* In the popular series, ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'', various forms of medical torture (including hallucinogens and injections) are utilized to obtain confessions and information from high-threat terrorists being interrogated in the fictional Counter-Terrorist Unit (CTU) of the United States.
* In Anthony Burgess' book ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange]]'', Alex, the anti-hero of the book, undergoes a fictional medical torture program called 'The Ludovico Technique', in which he is given a nausea-inducing drug, strapped to a chair with his eyelids forced open and forced to watch hours of films of extreme violence and rape to condition him to associate feelings of nausea with rape and violence.
* The theme of the 2009 horror film ''[[The Human Centipede (First Sequence)]]'' is that of a sadistic, psychopathic retired surgeon torturing three people by surgically connecting them mouth to rectum, forcing the last two to swallow the excrement of the person in front of them and physically beating all three of them if they try to rebel or escape.
* The 2008 horror film ''[[Autopsy (2008 film)|Autopsy]]'' focused on an insane doctor who runs a hospital where victims are lured in and experimented with, so that the doctor can find a cure for his wife's terminal disease.
* In the book ''[[Dearly Devoted Dexter]]'' by [[Jeff Lindsay (writer)|Jeff Lindsay]] the central antagonist is a character nicknamed 'Dr. Danco' who surgically removes all body parts not necessary for life from his victims as what is revealed to be forfeits in a twisted game of [[hangman (game)|hangman]], carrying out the operations with the victim conscious and watching the procedures in a mirror.
* The multi-perspective novel ''The Sea and Poison'' ([[Shusaku Endo]], 1957; translated by Michael Gallagher) depicts the vivisection experiments performed by Japanese doctors on American soldiers during World War II. Kei Kumai's 1986 drama film ''[[The Sea and Poison]]'' is based on this book (original film title "Umi to dokuyaku").
* Dr. Jane Payne, a character in the children's book ''[[Wayside School Gets A Little Stranger]]'', is a sadistic dentist who pulls more teeth than is necessary in order to get extra money.

The '''Ministry of Antiquities''' is the Egyptian government organization which serves to protect and preserve the heritage and ancient history of Egypt.

==History==
It was formed from the [[Supreme Council of Antiquities]] in 2011&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Brief History of the Supreme Council of Antiquities (SCA): 1858 to present|url=http://www.sca-egypt.org/eng/sca_history.htm|website=SCA Egypt|accessdate=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; during the reign of [[President of Egypt|President]] [[Hosni Mubarak]] to deal with the security and theft of Egyptian [[antiquities]].

'''Monte Cristi Pipe Wreck''' is a submerged [[archaeological]] site located off the north coast of [[Hispaniola]] in the [[Dominican Republic]] near the border of [[Haiti]], part of the [[Greater Antilles]] in the [[Caribbean]]. The site is one of the hundreds of historic shipwrecks that lie on the ocean floor between [[San Fernando de Monte Cristi|Monte Cristi]] and [[San Felipe de Puerto Plata|Puerto Plata]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Archaeological evidence indicates that the shipwreck is one of a merchant trader, probably sinking in the second half of the 17th century. Hispanola, together with [[Jamaica]], was originally settled by adventurous men seeking the life of a [[buccaneer]], and until the 18th century, these islands thrived through [[piracy]] rather than through growing sugar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

This wreck is known as the "Pipe Wreck" because of the large number of [[Smoking pipe (tobacco)#Clay|clay smoking pipes]] it carried as [[cargo]], the type of long pipe the indigenous inhabitants used to smoke tobacco that was a shaped cane and called ''tobago''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
The wreck lies at a depth of {{convert|4.4|m}}, in a bed of [[sea grass]] {{convert|80|m}} off the northeastern bulge of Isla Cabra&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Isla Cabra|url=https://www.google.com/maps/@19.889529,-71.6655635,4089m/data=!3m1!1e3|website=Google Maps|publisher=Google|accessdate=27 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the northern side of Monte Cristi Bay.

Five large masses are visible, covered by a layer of [[calcium carbonate]]. Three of the objects seem to be combinations of iron and copper-alloy, and two appear to be solid slabs of iron. The calcium carbonate furnishes ample material for the [[reef]] [[ecosystem]] that covers the existing [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]].&lt;ref name="shipwreck"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hall|first1=J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3316">'''Nausharo''' is located in [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]], [[Pakistan]].  It is well known as an archaeological site for the [[Indus Valley Civilization|Harappan]] period. The excavations were carried out between 1985 and 1996 by a French team of archaeologists, under the direction of [[Jean-François Jarrige]]. The other sites belonging to the same cluster are [[Mehrgarh]] and [[Pirak]].

==Nausharo excavation==
Excavations at Nausharo, 6&amp;nbsp;km from Mehrgarh, revealed a dwelling-site contemporaneous and identical to [[Mehrgarh]], It was occupied between 3000 and 2550 BCE and again between 2550 and 1900 BCE.

The discovery of a pottery workshop at Nausharo revealed fired and unfired pottery pieces and unworked clay, as well as 12 flint blades or blade fragments. The blades showed use-wear traces that indicates their usage in shaving clay while shaping pottery on a potter's wheel. The excavated blades were compared to experimentally produced replica blades used for a variety of other activities such as harvesting and processing of silica-rich plants, hide processing, and hand-held use for shaping clay; however, the use-wear traces were almost identical to the excavated blades when used with a mechanical potter's wheel in the shaping of clay pots. Also significant was the discovery of copper traces found on the platforms of two blades examined with a scanning electron microscope and X ray analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Méry|first1=S|last2=Anderson|first2=P|last3=Inizan|first3=M.L.|last4=Lechavallier|first4=M|last5=Pelegrin|first5=J|title=A pottery workshop with flint tools on blades knapper with copper at Nausharo (Indus civilisation ca. 2500 BC)|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|date=2007|volume=34|issue=7|pages=1098–1116|doi=10.1016/j.jas.2006.10.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[logic]], '''negation''', also called the '''logical complement''', is an [[operation (mathematics)|operation]] that takes a [[proposition]] &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; to another proposition "not &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;", written &lt;math&gt;\neg P&lt;/math&gt; (¬P), which is interpreted intuitively as being true when &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is false, and false when &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is true. Negation is thus a unary (single-argument) [[logical connective]]. It may be applied as an operation on [[notion (philosophy)|notions]], [[proposition]]s, [[truth value]]s, or [[interpretation (logic)|semantic values]] more generally. In [[classical logic]], negation is normally identified with the [[truth function]] that takes ''truth'' to ''falsity'' and vice versa. In [[intuitionistic logic]], according to the [[Brouwer–Heyting–Kolmogorov interpretation]], the negation of a proposition &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is the proposition whose proofs are the refutations of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;.

==Definition==
No agreement exists as to the possibility of defining negation, as to its logical status, function, and meaning, as to its field of applicability..., and as to the interpretation of the negative judgment, (F.H. Heinemann 1944).&lt;ref name=Horn&gt;{{cite book |last=Horn |first=Laurence R |year=2001 |title=A NATURAL HISTORY OF NEGATION |url=http://emilkirkegaard.dk/en/wp-content/uploads/A-natural-history-of-negation-Laurence-R.-Horn.pdf |location=Stanford University |chapter=Chapter 1 |page=1 |publisher=CLSI Publications |isbn=1-57586-336-7  |accessdate=29 Dec 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Classical negation'' is an  [[logical operation|operation]] on one [[logical value]], typically the value of a [[proposition]], that produces a value of ''true'' when its operand is false and a value of ''false'' when its operand is true.  So, if statement &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is true, then &lt;math&gt;\neg P&lt;/math&gt; (pronounced "not P") would therefore be false; and conversely, if &lt;math&gt;\neg P&lt;/math&gt; is false, then &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; would be true.

The [[truth table]] of &lt;math&gt;\neg P&lt;/math&gt; is as follows:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center; background-color: #ddffdd;"
|- bgcolor="#ddeeff"
| &lt;math&gt; P &lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt; \neg P &lt;/math&gt;
|-
| True || False
|-
| False || True
|}

Negation can be defined in terms of other logical operations.  For example, &lt;math&gt;\neg P&lt;/math&gt; can be defined as &lt;math&gt;P \rightarrow \bot&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; is [[logical consequence]] and &lt;math&gt;\bot&lt;/math&gt; is [[False_(logic)|absolute falsehood]]). Conversely, one can define &lt;math&gt;\bot&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;Q \land \neg Q&lt;/math&gt; for any proposition &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;\land&lt;/math&gt; is [[logical conjunction]]). The idea here is that any [[contradiction]] is false.  While these ideas work in both classical and intuitionistic logic, they do not work in [[paraconsistent logic]], where contradictions are not necessarily false. In classical logic, we also get a further identity, &lt;math&gt;P \rightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt; can be defined as &lt;math&gt;\neg P \lor Q&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\lor&lt;/math&gt; is [[logical disjunction]].

Algebraically, classical negation corresponds to [[Complement (order theory)|complementation]] in a [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]], and intuitionistic negation to pseudocomplementation in a [[Heyting algebra]]. These algebras provide a [[algebraic semantics (mathematical logic)|semantics]] for classical and intuitionistic logic respectively.

==Notation==
The negation of a proposition &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is notated in different ways in various contexts of discussion and fields of application. Among these variants are the following:

{| class="wikitable"
|- style="background:paleturquoise"
! style="text-align:center" | Notation
! Plain Text
! Vocalization
|-
| style="text-align:center" | &lt;math&gt;\neg p&lt;/math&gt;
| ¬p
| Not ''p''
|-
| style="text-align:center" | &lt;math&gt;\mathord{\sim} p&lt;/math&gt;
| ~p
| Not ''p''
|-
| style="text-align:center" | &lt;math&gt;-p&lt;/math&gt;
| -p
| Not ''p''
|-
| style="text-align:center" | N''p''
|
| En ''p''
|-
| style="text-align:center" | &lt;math&gt;p'&lt;/math&gt;
| p'
| {{unbulleted list
 | ''p'' prime,
 | ''p'' complement
 }}
|-
| style="text-align:center" | &lt;math&gt;\overline{p}&lt;/math&gt;
| ̅p
| {{unbulleted list
 | ''p'' bar,
 | Bar ''p''
 }}
|-
| style="text-align:center" | &lt;math&gt;!p&lt;/math&gt;
| !p
| {{unbulleted list
 | Bang ''p''
 | Not ''p''
 }}
|-
|}

The notation N''p'' is [[Polish_notation#Polish_notation_for_logic|Łukasiewicz notation]].

In [[Set theory#Basic concepts and notation|set theory]] &lt;math&gt;\setminus&lt;/math&gt; is also used to indicate 'not member of': &lt;math&gt;U \setminus A&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all members of &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; that are not members of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.

No matter how it is notated or [[List of logic symbols|symbolized]], the negation &lt;math&gt;\neg P&lt;/math&gt; can be read as "it is not the case that &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;", "not that &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;", or usually more simply as "not &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;".

==Properties==

===Double negation===

Within a system of [[classical logic]], double negation, that is, the negation of the negation of a proposition &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, is [[logically equivalent]] to &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;.  Expressed in symbolic terms, &lt;math&gt;\neg \neg P \equiv P&lt;/math&gt;. In [[intuitionistic logic]], a proposition implies its double negation but not conversely. This marks one important difference between classical and intuitionistic negation. Algebraically, classical negation is called an [[involution (mathematics)|involution]] of period two.

However, in [[intuitionistic logic]] we do have the equivalence of &lt;math&gt;\neg \neg \neg P \equiv \neg P&lt;/math&gt;. Moreover, in the propositional case, a sentence is classically provable if its double negation is intuitionistically provable. This result is known as [[Double-negation translation|Glivenko's theorem]].

===Distributivity===

[[De Morgan's laws]] provide a way of [[Distributive property|distributing]] negation over [[logical disjunction|disjunction]] and [[logical conjunction|conjunction]] :

:&lt;math&gt;\neg(P \lor Q) \equiv (\neg P \land \neg Q)&lt;/math&gt;,&amp;nbsp; and
:&lt;math&gt;\neg(P \land Q) \equiv (\neg P \lor \neg Q)&lt;/math&gt;.

===Linearity===
Let &lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt; denote the logical [[Exclusive or|xor]] operation. In [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]], a linear function is one such that:

If there exists &lt;math&gt;a_0, a_1, \dots, a_n \in \{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;f(b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n) = a_0 \oplus (a_1 \land b_1) \oplus \dots \oplus (a_n \land b_n)&lt;/math&gt;,
for all &lt;math&gt;b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n \in \{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt;.

Another way to express this is that each variable always makes a difference in the [[truth-value]] of the operation or it never makes a difference. Negation is a linear logical operator.

===Self dual===
In [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]] a self dual function is one such that:

&lt;math&gt;f(a_1, \dots, a_n) = \neg f(\neg a_1, \dots, \neg a_n)&lt;/math&gt; for all
&lt;math&gt;a_1, \dots, a_n \in \{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt;.
Negation is a self dual logical operator.

==Rules of inference==
There are a number of equivalent ways to formulate rules for negation. One usual way to formulate classical negation in a [[natural deduction]] setting is to take as primitive rules of inference ''negation introduction'' (from a derivation of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; to both &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\neg Q&lt;/math&gt;, infer &lt;math&gt;\neg P&lt;/math&gt;; this rule also being called ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]''), ''negation elimination'' (from &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\neg P&lt;/math&gt; infer &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;; this rule also being called ''ex falso quodlibet''), and ''double negation elimination'' (from &lt;math&gt;\neg \neg P&lt;/math&gt; infer &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;). One obtains the rules for intuitionistic negation the same way but by excluding double negation elimination.

Negation introduction states that if an absurdity can be drawn as conclusion from &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; must not be the case (i.e. &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is false (classically) or refutable (intuitionistically) or etc.). Negation elimination states that anything follows from an absurdity. Sometimes negation elimination is formulated using a primitive absurdity sign &lt;math&gt;\bot&lt;/math&gt;. In this case the rule says that from &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\neg P&lt;/math&gt; follows an absurdity. Together with double negation elimination one may infer our originally formulated rule, namely that anything follows from an absurdity.

Typically the intuitionistic negation &lt;math&gt;\neg P&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;math&gt;P \rightarrow \bot&lt;/math&gt;. Then negation introduction and elimination are just special cases of implication introduction ([[conditional proof]]) and elimination ([[modus ponens]]). In this case one must also add as a primitive rule ''ex falso quodlibet''.

==Programming==
As in mathematics, negation is used in [[computer science]] to construct logical statements.
&lt;source lang="cpp"&gt;
    if (!(r == t))
    {
         /*...statements executed when r does NOT equal t...*/
    }
&lt;/source&gt;
The "&lt;code&gt;!&lt;/code&gt;" signifies logical NOT in [[B (programming language)|B]], [[C Programming Language|C]], and languages with a C-inspired syntax such as [[C++]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[JavaScript]], [[Perl]], and [[PHP]]. "&lt;code&gt;NOT&lt;/code&gt;" is the operator used in [[ALGOL 60]], [[BASIC programming language|BASIC]], and languages with an ALGOL- or BASIC-inspired syntax such as [[Pascal programming language|Pascal]], [[Ada programming language|Ada]], [[Eiffel (programming language)|Eiffel]] and [[Seed7]]. Some languages (C++, Perl, etc.) provide more than one operator for negation. A few languages like [[PL/I]] and [[Ratfor]] use &lt;code&gt;¬&lt;/code&gt; for negation. Some modern computers and [[operating systems]] will display &lt;code&gt;¬&lt;/code&gt; as &lt;code&gt;!&lt;/code&gt; on files encoded in [[ASCII]]. Most modern languages allow the above statement to be shortened from &lt;code&gt;if (!(r == t))&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;if (r != t)&lt;/code&gt;, which allows sometimes, when the compiler/interpreter is not able to optimize it, faster programs.

In computer science there is also ''bitwise negation''. This takes the value given and switches all the [[binary numeral system|binary]] 1s to 0s and 0s to 1s.  See [[bitwise operation]].  This is often used to create [[signed number representations|ones' complement]] or "&lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt;" in C or C++ and [[two's complement]] (just simplified to "&lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt;" or the negative sign since this is equivalent to taking the arithmetic negative value of the number) as it basically creates the opposite (negative value equivalent) or mathematical complement of the value (where both values are added together they create a whole).

To get the absolute (positive equivalent) value of a given integer the following would work as the "&lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt;" changes it from negative to positive (it is negative because "&lt;code&gt;x &lt; 0&lt;/code&gt;" yields true)

&lt;source lang="cpp"&gt;
    unsigned int abs(int x)
    {
        if (x &lt; 0)
            return -x;
        else
            return x;
    }
&lt;/source&gt;

To demonstrate logical negation:

&lt;source lang="cpp"&gt;
    unsigned int abs(int x)
    {
        if (!(x &lt; 0))
            return x;
        else
            return -x;
    }
&lt;/source&gt;

Inverting the condition and reversing the outcomes produces code that is logically equivalent to the original code, i.e. will have identical results for any input (note that depending on the compiler used, the actual instructions performed by the computer may differ).

This convention occasionally surfaces in written speech, as computer-related [[slang]] for ''not''.  The phrase &lt;code&gt;!voting&lt;/code&gt;, for example, means "not voting".

==Kripke semantics==
In [[Kripke semantics]] where the semantic values of formulae are sets of [[possible world]]s, negation can be taken to mean [[set-theoretic complement]]ation.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} (See also [[possible world semantics]].)

'''Paul Webley''' [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (19 November 1953 – 2 March 2016) was director and [[vice-chancellor|principal]] of the [[School of Oriental and African Studies]], [[University of London]] from 2006 to 2015.  From 2010 until his death in 2016, he was [[Deputy Vice-Chancellor]] of the [[University of London]].&lt;ref&gt;SOAS Director appointed Deputy Vice-Chancellor of University of London https://www.soas.ac.uk/news/newsitem58215.html&lt;/ref&gt;  He was a member of the editorial board of the ''[[Journal of Economic Psychology]]'' and a former president of the [[International Association for Research in Economic Psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/former-soas-director-paul-webley-dies|title=Former SOAS director Paul Webley dies|last=|first=|date=|work=Times Higher Education (THE)|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Webley12.JPG|thumb|alt=Paul Webley.|Paul Webley speaking at the Institute of Education.]]

Webley received his BSc and PhD from the [[London School of Economics]]. After a brief period at the [[University of Southampton]] he moved to the [[University of Exeter]], where he remained for 26 years, rising from lecturer to professor of [[economic psychology]].  He was head of the Department and School of Psychology from 1993 to 2003, and from 2003 to 2006 he was one of the university's deputy vice-chancellors (Senior Deputy VC, 2005-6).  His major research interests were economic [[socialization]], the psychology of money, and the psychology of [[tax]]ation, though he also worked on [[environmental psychology]] and the general issue of the [[social psychology]] underlying rule [[compliance (regulation)|compliance]].

Webley was appointed [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] in the [[2015 New Year Honours]] for services to higher education.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=61092|supp=y|page=N10|date=31 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/391413/New_Year_Honours_List_2015.pdf 2015 New Year Honours List]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==

Webley wrote 10 books, 58 chapters in books, 68 journal articles, and more than a dozen papers for newsletters, magazines, and miscellaneous professional and academic publications. A full list is available here:

==Site description==
The petroglyphs of Arpa-Uzen, located on ancient migration routes, include over 3500 examples of [[rock art]], the most abundant collection in all of southern [[Kazakhstan]].  These pictorials depict scenes from life during the Late [[Bronze Age]] to Early [[Iron Age]], portraying the domestication and sacrifice of animals amongst other things.  A [[palimpsest]] was formed wherein older petroglyphs were covered by [[Saka]] pictorials from the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/1135/ Petroglyphs of Arpa-Uzen - UNESCO World Heritage Centre]
&lt;/ref&gt;

==World Heritage Status==
This site was added to the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage]] Tentative List on September 24, 1998 in the Cultural category.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/1135/ Petroglyphs of Arpa-Uzen - UNESCO World Heritage Centre]

'''Pierre Bottineau''' (January 1, 1817 &amp;ndash; July 26, 1895) was a [[Minnesota]] [[frontiersman]].&lt;ref&gt;'Compendium of History and Biography of Central and Northern Minnesota,' G. A. Ogle &amp; Company: 1904, Biographical Sketch of Pierre Bottineau, pg. 144&lt;/ref&gt;

Known as the "[[Kit Carson]] of [[Old Northwest|the Northwest]]," he was an integral part of the history and development of [[Minnesota]] and [[North Dakota]]. He was an accomplished surveyor and his many settlement parties founded cities all over Minnesota and North Dakota. Those settlements would become cities such as [[Osseo, Minnesota]] and [[Maple Grove, Minnesota]] northwest of the Twin Cities, as well as [[Breckenridge, Minnesota]] and [[Wahpeton, North Dakota]] on either side of the [[Red River of the North]].

He also took part in the founding of Orono Village, [[Sherburne County, Minnesota]] (later absorbed by), [[Elk River, Minnesota]] and the booming city of St. Anthony (later absorbed by [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]]). He was also a renowned diplomat and translator, earning him the nickname "The Walking Peace Pipe." He played a part in forging many treaties with Native American tribes. According to his obituary he spoke [[French language|French]], [[English language|English]], [[Dakota language|Dakota]], [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]], [[Cree language|Cree]], [[Mandan language|Mandan]], and [[Winnebago language|Winnebago]].

Pierre was born in a hunting camp on the [[American bison|buffalo]] trail near [[Grand Forks, North Dakota|Grand Forks]]. His father Charles Bottineau was a [[French Canadians|French-Canadian]], and his mother Marguerite Macheyquayzaince Ahdicksongab "(Clear Sky Woman)" "Queen of the Skies" was half [[Dakota people|Dakota]] and half [[Ojibwe]] of the Lake of the Woods band, she was a sister of Pembina Ojibwe Chief Misko-Makwa or Red Bear, the daughter of Waubojeeg "King Fisher" last ruler of the O'Jibway Dynasty. Pierre's grandfather was Mamongazida "Loons Foot" of the Adik Reindeer Clan. 

Although technically born in United States territory, control of the Upper Mississippi Valley fell to the British during the [[War of 1812]]. Even after the 1815 [[Treaty of Ghent]] returned the land to the United States, British and Canadian traders and the Native American tribes held all real control in the area. The U.S. government used Pierre and others like him to settle the land and help establish American sovereignty. Most mixed race, or [[Métis]], lived as outcasts to both White and Native societies, but Pierre would soon use his many talents to become accepted as an American hero. His many invaluable services earned him celebrity status in his time. Upon his retirement, the United States Congress granted him a pension of $50 a month. He died in [[Red Lake Falls, Minnesota]] at the age of 78.

[[Bottineau County, North Dakota]], and its county seat [[Bottineau, North Dakota]] are named in his honor as well as the Pierre Bottineau branch library and Bottineau Park in Minneapolis and [[County Road 81 (Hennepin County, Minnesota)|Bottineau Blvd]] in [[Hennepin County, Minnesota]]. The [[Bottineau LRT]] line has been proposed in Minneapolis.

{{The Works of Aristotle}}
[[Aristotle]]'s '''''Poetics''''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Περὶ ποιητικῆς}}; {{lang-la|De Poetica}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isnature.org/Files/Aristotle/ ''Aristotelis Opera''] by [[August Immanuel Bekker]] (1837)&lt;/ref&gt; c. 335 BC&lt;ref name="dukore"&gt;Dukore (1974, 31).&lt;/ref&gt;) is the earliest surviving work of [[dramatic theory]] and first [[Extant literature|extant]] philosophical treatise to focus on [[literary theory]] in the West.&lt;ref&gt;Janko (1987, ix).&lt;/ref&gt;  This has been the traditional view for centuries.  However, recent work is now challenging whether Aristotle focuses on literary theory per se (given that not one poem exists in the treatise) or whether he focuses instead on dramatic musical theory that only has language as one of the elements.&lt;ref&gt;"Aristotle on the Power of Music in Tragedy," Pierre Destrée, Greek &amp; Roman Musical Studies, Vol. 4, Issue 2, 2016; Gregory L. Scott, ''Aristotle on Dramatic Musical Composition The Real Role of Literature, Catharsis, Music and Dance in the Poetics'' (2016b), {{ISBN|9780999704929}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In it, Aristotle offers an account of what he calls "poetry" (a term which in Greek literally means "making" and in this context includes verse [[drama]] – [[Comedy (drama)|comedy]], [[tragedy]], and the [[satyr play]] – as well as [[lyric poetry]] and [[epic poetry]]). They are similar in the fact that they are all imitations but different in the three ways that Aristotle describes:
# Differences in music rhythm, harmony, meter and melody. 
# Difference of goodness in the characters. 
# Difference in how the narrative is presented:  telling a story or acting it out.

In examining its "first principles", Aristotle finds two: 1) imitation and 2) [[genre]]s and other concepts by which that of truth is applied/revealed in the poesis. His analysis of [[tragedy]] constitutes the core of the discussion.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle ''Poetics'' 1447a13 (1987, 1).&lt;/ref&gt; Although Aristotle's ''Poetics'' is universally acknowledged in the [[Western culture|Western]] critical tradition, "almost every detail about his seminal work has aroused divergent opinions".&lt;ref name="carlson"&gt;Carlson (1993, 16).&lt;/ref&gt;

The work was lost to the Western world for a long time. It was available in the [[Middle Ages]] and early [[Renaissance]] only through a Latin translation of an Arabic version written by [[Averroes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Habib|first=M.A.R.|title=A History of Literary Criticism and Theory: From Plato to the Present|year=2005|publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]]|isbn=0-631-23200-1|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reason is that Aristotle says three times in the treatise that the protagonist can go from fortune to misfortune or &lt;i&gt;misfortune to fortune&lt;/i&gt;; also in Chapter 14 the best type of &lt;i&gt;tragoidos&lt;/i&gt; is that which ends happily, like &lt;i&gt;Cresphontes&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Iphigenia&lt;/i&gt; (presumably &lt;i&gt;"in Tauris"&lt;/i&gt;)!&lt;ref&gt;&lt;i&gt;Aristotle's Favorite Tragedy: Oedipus or Cresphontes?&lt;/i&gt;, Gregory Scott, 2018, {{ISBN|9780999704912}} or 9780999704905&lt;/ref&gt;

===Form===
The table of contents page of the ''Poetics'' found in Modern Library's ''Basic Works of Aristotle'' (2001) identifies five basic parts within it.&lt;ref&gt;''The Basic Works of Aristotle''. Ed. Richard McKeon Modern Library (2001) – Poetics. Trans. Ingrid Bywater, pp. 1453–87&lt;/ref&gt;

* A. Preliminary discourse on tragedy, epic poetry, and comedy, as the chief forms of imitative poetry.
* B. Definition of a tragedy, and the rules for its construction. Definition and analysis into qualitative parts.
* C. Rules for the construction of a tragedy: Tragic pleasure, or [[catharsis]] experienced by fear and pity should be produced in the spectator. The characters must be four things: good, appropriate, realistic, and consistent. [[Discovery (observation)|Discovery]] must occur within the plot. Narratives, stories, structures and poetics overlap. It is important for the poet to visualize all of the scenes when creating the plot. The poet should incorporate complication and [[dénouement]] within the story, as well as combine all of the elements of [[tragedy]]. The poet must express thought through the characters' words and actions, while paying close attention to [[diction]] and how a character's spoken words express a specific idea. Aristotle believed that all of these different elements had to be present in order for the poetry to be well-done.  However, starting in 1948 with a Macedonian classicist, M.D. Petruševski, some scholars have rejected that Aristotle himself could have written the word ''katharsis'' in the definition of tragedy, because unlike all of the other words in the definition, it is not discussed either before or after the definition.&lt;ref&gt;M.D. Petruševski "Pathēmatōn Katharsin ou bien Pragmatōn Systasin?," Ziva antika/Antiquite vivante (Skopje: Societe d'etudes classiques Ziva Antika) 1954.

* D. Possible criticisms of an epic or tragedy, and the answers to them.
* E. Tragedy as artistically superior to epic poetry: Tragedy has everything that the epic has, even the epic meter being admissible. The reality of presentation is felt in the play as read, as well as in the play as acted. The tragic imitation requires less space for the attainment of its end. If it has more concentrated effect, it is more pleasurable than one with a large admixture of time to dilute it. There is less unity in the imitation of the epic poets (plurality of actions) and this is proved by the fact that an epic poem can supply enough material for several tragedies.

===Content===

Aristotle distinguishes between the [[genre]]s of "poetry" in three ways:
* Matter
::[[language]], [[rhythm]], and [[melody]], for Aristotle, make up the matter of poetic creation. Where the [[epic poem]] makes use of language alone, the playing of the lyre involves rhythm and melody. Some poetic forms include a blending of all materials; for example, Greek tragic drama included a singing chorus, and so music and language were all part of the performance.  These points also convey the standard view.  Recent work, though, argues that translating ''rhuthmos'' here as "rhythm" is absurd:  melody already has its own inherent musical rhythm, and the Greek can mean what Plato says it means in ''Laws'' II, 665a:  "(the name of) ordered body movement," or dance.  This correctly conveys what dramatic musical creation, the topic of the ''Poetics'', in ancient Greece had:  music, dance, and language.  Also, the musical instrument cited in Ch 1 is not the lyre but the ''kithara'', which was played in the drama while the kithara-player was dancing (in the chorus), even if that meant just walking in an appropriate way.  Moreover, epic might have had only literary exponents, but as Plato's ''Ion'' and Aristotle's Ch 26 of the ''Poetics'' help prove, for Plato and Aristotle at least some epic rhapsodes used all three means of mimesis:  language, dance (as pantomimic gesture), and music (if only by chanting the words).&lt;ref name="Scott 2016b"&gt;Scott (2016b)&lt;/ref&gt;  
* Subjects
::Also "agents" in some translations. Aristotle differentiates between [[tragedy]] and [[comedy]] throughout the work by distinguishing between the nature of the [[Character (arts)|human characters]] that populate either form. Aristotle finds that tragedy treats of serious, important, and virtuous people. Comedy, on the other hand, treats of less virtuous people and  focuses on human "weaknesses and foibles".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Aristotle's Poetics|page= 270

|first= Stephen |last= Halliwell |year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle introduces here the influential ''tripartite division of characters'' in superior (βελτίονας) to the audience, inferior (χείρονας), or at the same level (τοιούτους).&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Michael Sifakis (2001) [https://books.google.com/books?id=9GfLAlkcFYgC&amp;pg=PA50 ''Aristotle on the function of tragic poetry''] p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, Poetics 1448a, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0056%3Asection%3D1448a English], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0055%3Asection%3D1448a original Greek]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Northrop Frye]] (1957). ''[[Anatomy of Criticism]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Method
::One may imitate the agents through use of a narrator throughout, or only occasionally (using direct speech in parts and a narrator in parts, as Homer does), or only through direct speech (without a narrator), using actors to speak the lines directly.  This latter is the method of tragedy (and comedy): without use of any narrator.

Having examined briefly the field of "poetry" in general, Aristotle proceeds to his definition of tragedy:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Tragedy is a [[Mimesis|representation]] of a serious, complete action which has magnitude, in embellished speech, with each of its elements [used] separately in the [various] parts [of the play] and [represented] by people acting and not by [[Diegesis|narration]], accomplishing by means of pity and [[terror]] the [[catharsis]] of such emotions.

By "embellished speech", I mean that which has rhythm and melody, i.e. song. By "with its elements separately", I mean that some [parts of it] are accomplished only by means of spoken verses, and others again by means of song (1449b25-30).&lt;ref&gt;Janko (1987, 7). In Butcher's translation, this passage reads: "Tragedy, then, is an imitation of an action that is serious, complete, and of a certain magnitude; in language embellished with each kind of artistic ornament, the several kinds being found in separate parts of the play, in the form of action, not of narrative; through pity and fear effecting the proper [[catharsis]] of these emotions."&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
He then identifies the "parts" of tragedy:

* [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] (''[[Mythos (Aristotle)|mythos]]'')
::Refers to the "organization of incidents". It should imitate an action evoking pity and fear. The plot involves a change from bad towards good, or good towards bad. Complex plots have reversals and recognitions. These and suffering (or violence) are used to evoke the tragic emotions. The most tragic plot pushes a good character towards undeserved misfortune because of a mistake  (''[[hamartia]]''). Plots revolving around such a mistake are more tragic than plots with two sides and an opposite outcome for the good and the bad. Violent situations are most tragic if they are between friends and family. Threats can be resolved (best last) by being done in knowledge, done in ignorance and then discovered, almost be done in ignorance but be discovered in the last moment.

::Actions should be follow logically from the situation created by what has happened before, and from the character of the agent. This goes for recognitions and reversals as well, as even surprises are more satisfying to the audience if they afterwards are seen as a plausible or necessary consequence.

* [[Character (arts)|character]] (''[[ethos]]'')
::Character is the moral or ethical character of the agents. It is revealed when the agent makes moral choices. In a perfect tragedy, the character will support the plot, which means personal motivations and traits will somehow connect parts of the cause-and-effect chain of actions producing pity and fear. 
::Main character should be
::* good—Aristotle explains that audiences do not like, for example, villains "making fortune from misery" in the end. It might happen though, and might make the play interesting. Nevertheless, the moral is at stake here and morals are important to make people happy (people can, for example, see tragedy because they want to release their anger)
::* appropriate—if a character is supposed to be wise, it is unlikely he is young (supposing wisdom is gained with age)
::* consistent—if a person is a soldier, he is unlikely to be scared of blood (if this soldier is scared of blood it must be explained and play some role in the story to avoid confusing the audience); it is also "good" if a character doesn't change opinion "that much" if the play is not "driven" by who characters are, but by what they do (audience is confused in case of unexpected shifts in behaviour [and its reasons and morals] of characters)
::* "consistently inconsistent"—if a character always behaves foolishly it is strange if he suddenly becomes smart. In this case it would be good to explain such change, otherwise the audience may be confused. If character changes opinion a lot it should be clear he is a character who has this trait, not a real life person - this is also to avoid confusion
* thought (''[[dianoia]]'')—spoken (usually) reasoning of human characters can explain the characters or story background
* diction (''[[Lexis (Aristotle)|lexis]]'')  Lexis is better translated according to some as "speech" or "language."  Otherwise, the relevant necessary condition stemming from ''logos'' in the definition (language) has no followup:  mythos (plot) could be done by dancers or pantomime artists, given Chs 1, 2 and 4, if the actions are structured (on stage, as drama was usually done), just like plot for us can be given in film or in a story-ballet with no words.&lt;ref name="Scott 2016b"/&gt;
::Refers to the quality of speech in tragedy. Speeches should reflect character, the moral qualities of those on the stage. The expression of the meaning of the words.
* melody (''melos'')  "Melos" can also mean "music-dance" as some musicologists recognize, especially given that its primary meaning in ancient Greek is "limb" (an arm or a leg).  This is arguably more sensible because then Aristotle is conveying what the chorus actually did.&lt;ref&gt;Scott 2016a and 2016b&lt;/ref&gt;
::The Chorus too should be regarded as one of the actors. It should be an integral part of the whole, and share in the action. Should be contributed to the unity of the plot. It is a very real factor in the pleasure of the drama. 
* spectacle (''[[opsis]]'')
::Refers to the visual apparatus of the play, including set, costumes and props (anything you can see). Aristotle calls spectacle the "least artistic" element of tragedy, and the "least connected with the work of the poet (playwright). For example: if the play has "beautiful" costumes and "bad" acting and "bad" story, there is "something wrong" with it. Even though that "beauty" may save the play it is "not a nice thing".

He offers the earliest-surviving explanation for the origins of tragedy and comedy:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Anyway, arising from an [[Improvisation|improvisatory]] beginning (both tragedy and comedy—tragedy from the leaders of the [[dithyramb]], and comedy from the leaders of the [[phallic processions]] which even now continue as a custom in many of our cities) [...] (1449a10-13)&lt;ref&gt;
Janko (1987, 6). This text is [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Aristot.+Poet.+1449a available online] in an older translation, in which the same passage reads: "At any rate it originated in improvisation—both tragedy itself and [[Comedy (drama)|comedy]]. The one tragedy came from the prelude to the dithyramb and the other comedy from the prelude to the [[Fertility rite|phallic songs]] which still survive as institutions in many cities."
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Influence==
[[File:Poetique Aristote Arabe 2346.jpg|thumbnail|Arabic translation of the ''Poetics'' by [[Abu Bishr Matta ibn Yunus|Abū Bishr Mattā]].]]
The Arabic version of Aristotle's ''Poetics'' that influenced the [[Middle Ages]] was translated from a Greek manuscript dated to some time prior to the year 700. This manuscript, translated from Greek to Syriac, is independent of the currently-accepted 11th-century source designated ''Paris 1741.''  The [[Syriac language | Syriac-language]] source used for the Arabic translations departed widely in vocabulary from the original ''Poetics'' and it initiated a misinterpretation of Aristotelian thought that continued through the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;Hardison, 81.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Paris 1741'' appears online at the Bibliothèque nationale de France (National Library of France).&lt;ref&gt;To obtain it on images or on a pdf format, follow this route: &gt; http://www.bnf.fr/; &gt; COLLECTIONS ET SERVICES; &gt; Catalogues; &gt; Accès à BnF archives et manuscrits; &gt; Collections; &gt; Département des Manuscrits; &gt; Grec; &gt; Manuscrits grecs - Présentation du fonds. &gt; Grec 1741 &gt; Download Images or pdf. The Poetics begins at 184r, page 380 of the pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

Arabic scholars who published significant commentaries on Aristotle's ''Poetics'' included [[Avicenna]], [[Al-Farabi]] and [[Averroes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Encyclopedia of Rhetoric and Composition|pages= 15–16

A '''postpipe''' or '''post pipe''' is the remains of an upright timber placed in a [[posthole]]. Given the right conditions, timbers may survive over long periods of time and a recovered postpipe can be of solid wood. Under less preservative conditions, only a dark circular stain of organic material may be left in the fill of the posthole observable in plan and [[archaeological section|section]]. This differs in consistency from the less organic backfill of the posthole and can be identified through this change in makeup. The size and depth and of the postpipe can provide information as to any reuse of the posthole especially if several different postpipes can be identified. They can also indicate the species of wood used and help suggest the nature of the structure that the timber once supported.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4630">'''Robert Deutsch''' is an Israeli antiquities dealer, known for being accused and acquitted of only one forgery charge - out of six while the other charges were dropped due to being obsolete - of several biblical archaeological artifacts. 
==Trial, acquittal and subsequent lawsuit ==   
In 2004, Deutsch, [[Oded Golan]] and two others were indicted in a Jerusalem court on charges of forgery. The [[Israel Antiquities Authority]] (IAA) claimed that the four were part of a forgery ring that had been operating for more than 20 years, misleading collectors of biblical artifacts into purchasing modern day forgeries. 
In 2012, Deutsch was acquitted of all charges,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[Haaretz]]|url=http://www.haaretz.com/blogs/outside-edge/.premium-1.591953|title='Jehoash Tablet' Returns to Owner

Following his acquittal, Dr. Robert Deutsch sued the IAA, its director Shuka Dorfman, the head of the IAA's anti-theft unit Amir Ganor, the Jerusalem District Attorney and Assistant district Attorney. Demanding $3 million in damages, the suit alleged gross negligence by the defendants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[Fox news]]|url=http://www.foxnews.com/science/2013/12/03/antiques-dealer-sues-israeli-government-for-3-million-after-acquitted-forgery.html|title=Antiques dealer sues Israel for $3 million after being acquitted of forgery charges|date=December 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Jerusalem District Court
[17.03.2008]
Honorable Justice Aharon Farkash&lt;ref&gt;

...........


The request of the Defendant 2, Robert Deutsch (hereinafter: "the Defendant" or "Deutsch") to cancel the indictment against him, in whole or in part, on the grounds of "defense of justice".


...........

The bottom line is that I did not find grounds for the cancellation of the charges against the defendant, but I found it appropriate to state that there was no room for the harsh and harsh words that were claimed in the application against the investigators on behalf of the Israel Antiquities Authority or against the plaintiff, or against the State barrister Dan Bahat. Each of them fulfills his or her duties, to the best of his ability and in good faith, when he is under the supervision of his superiors. Even if the Defendant's counsel believes that there was no basis for filing an indictment against his client, it would not have been appropriate to use such harsh words and to relate to the Plaintiff and the Investigator some malicious intentions, as stated above, without any basis being laid to prove them.

...........

This being said the defendant's request to cancel the indictment against him, in whole or in part, is rejected.

Robert Deutsch holds 99% of the stock shares of “Archaeological Center Ltd.” having registered headquarters at 26 Eliezer Kaplan, Herzlia, Israel. Deutsch is also the CEO of the Center.

During the years, both Deutsch and the Center avoided heavy tax payments while illegally claiming that the Center legitimately paid the expenses incurred during Deutsch trial in which he was charged with six criminal offenses.

The tax avoiding payment issue reached the court in several cases and appeals initiated by Deutsch started with the District Court and ended with the Supreme Court. In all these cases Deutsch and the Center actions and claims were turned down by the court while both Deutsch and/or the Center were ordered by the court to pay the significant amounts to the State as "legal expenditures" - these in addition to the taxation debts.

{{Spanish language}}
'''Spanglish''' (a [[portmanteau]] of the words "Spanish" and "English") is a name sometimes given to various contact dialects, [[pidgin]]s, or [[creole language]]s that result from interaction between Spanish and English used by people who speak both languages or parts of both languages, mainly in the United States. It is a blend of Spanish and English [[lexical item]]s and [[grammar]].  Spanglish is not a [[pidgin]], because unlike pidgin languages, Spanglish can be the primary speech form for some individuals.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Spanglish can be considered a variety of Spanish with heavy use of English or a variety of English with heavy use of Spanish.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} It can be more related either to Spanish or to English, depending on the circumstances. Since Spanglish arises independently in each region, it reflects the locally spoken varieties of English and Spanish. In general different varieties of Spanglish are not necessarily mutually intelligible. In Mexican and Chicano Spanish the common term for "Spanglish" is "Pocho".&lt;ref name="D'Amore2009"&gt;{{cite book|last= D'Amore|first=Anna Maria|title=Translating Contemporary Mexican Texts: Fidelity to Alterity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1hLCm7MH7u8C&amp;pg=PA79|year=2009|publisher=Peter Lang|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4331-0499-2|page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was introduced by the Puerto Rican poet [[Salvador Tió]] in the late 1940s, when he called it '''Espanglish''' or ''Inglañol'' (from ''Español'' + ''English'', and ''Inglés'' + ''Español'', respectively).&lt;ref&gt;[http://repeatingislands.com/2011/11/15/salvador-tio%E2%80%99s-100th-anniversary/ Repeating Islands: News and commentary on Caribbean culture, literature, and the arts]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of these creoles have become recognized languages in their own right, such as [[San Andrés–Providencia Creole]] of Colombia.

==History and distribution==
In the late 1940s, the Puerto Rican journalist, poet, and essayist [[Salvador Tió]] coined the terms ''Espanglish'' (later shortened to ''Spanglish'') for Spanish spoken with some English terms, and the less commonly used ''Inglañol'' (for English spoken with some Spanish terms).

After Puerto Rico became a United States territory in 1898, Spanglish became progressively more common there as the United States Army and the early colonial administration tried to impose the English language on island residents. Between 1902 and 1948, the main language of instruction in public schools (used for all subjects except Spanish language courses) was English. Currently Puerto Rico is nearly unique in having both English and Spanish as its official languages&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nash|first1=Rose|title=Spanglish: Language Contact in Puerto Rico|journal=American Speech|volume=45|issue=3/4|pages=223|doi=10.2307/454837}}&lt;/ref&gt; (but see also [[New Mexico#Official language|New Mexico]]). Consequently, many American English words are now found in the vocabulary of Puerto Rican Spanish. ''Spanglish'' may also be known by different regional names.

Spanglish does not have one unified dialect—specifically, the varieties of Spanglish spoken in New York, Florida, Texas, and California differ. Spanglish is popular in many Spanish-speaking communities in the United States, especially in the [[Miami Hispanic]] community.  Monolingual speakers of standard Spanish may have difficulty in understanding it.&lt;ref&gt;Ardila 2005, pg. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;
It is common in Panama, where the 96-year (1903–1999) U.S. control of the [[Panama Canal]] influenced much of local society, especially among the former residents of the [[Panama Canal Zone]], the [[Zonian]]s.

Many Puerto Ricans living on the island of [[St. Croix]] speak in informal situations a unique Spanglish-like combination of [[Puerto Rican Spanish]] and the local [[Virgin Islands Creole|Crucian dialect]], which is very different from the Spanglish spoken elsewhere. The same applies to the large Puerto Rican-descended populations of New York City and Boston.

Spanglish is spoken commonly in the modern United States, reflecting the growth of the Hispanic-American population due to immigration. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the population of Hispanics grew from 35.3 million to 53 million between 2000 and 2012.&lt;ref name="Guzman, B. 2000 &amp; US Census 2012"&gt;Guzman, B. 2000 &amp; US Census 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Hispanics have become the largest minority ethnic group in the US.  More than 60% are of Mexican descent. Mexican Americans form one of the fastest-growing groups, increasing from 20.6 million to 34.5 million between 2000 and 2012.&lt;ref name="Guzman, B. 2000 &amp; US Census 2012"/&gt; Around 58% of this community chose California, especially Southern California, as their new home. Spanglish is widely used throughout the heavily Mexican-American and other Hispanic communities of Southern California.&lt;ref name="Rothman, Jason pg. 1"&gt;Rothman, Jason &amp; Rell, Amy Beth, pg. 1&lt;/ref&gt;
The use of Spanglish has become important to Hispanic communities throughout the United States in areas such as Miami, New York City, Texas, and California. In Miami, the [[Afro-Cuban]] community makes use of a Spanglish familiarly known as "Cubonics," a portmanteau of the words "Cuban" and "Ebonics," a slang term for [[African American Vernacular English]] that is itself a portmanteau of "Ebony phonics."&lt;ref name="Rothman, Jason pg. 1"/&gt;

Spanglish is known as bilingualism/ ''semi-lingualism.'' The acquisition of the first language is interrupted or unstructured language input follows from the second language. This can also happen in reverse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pendientedemigracion.ucm.es/info/circulo/no56/lopez.pdf|title=Spanglish from a neurologist point of view|last=Lopez|first=Angel|date=2013|website=El Circulo|publisher=Universidad Computense de Madrid|access-date=2016-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Mexican-Americans (Chicanos), immigrants and bilinguals express themselves in various forms of Spanglish. For many, Spanglish serves as a basis for self-identity, but others believe that it should not exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://homes.chass.utoronto.ca/~cpercy/courses/6362Olague2.htm|title=Towards New Dialects: Spanglish in the United States|website=homes.chass.utoronto.ca|access-date=2016-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Spanglish is difficult, because if the speaker learned the two languages in separate contexts, they use the ''conditioned system'', in which the referential meanings in the two languages differ considerably. Those who were literate in their first language before learning the other, and who have support to maintain that literacy, are sometimes those least able to master their second language. Spanglish is part of ''receptive bilingualism.'' Receptive bilinguals are those who understand a second language but don't speak it. That is when they use Spanglish. Receptive bilinguals are also known as ''productively bilingual'', since—to give an answer, the speaker exerts much more mental effort to answer in English, Spanish, or Spanglish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fusion.net/story/269512/bilingual-makes-brain-stronger/|title=Does Speaking English And Spanish Make You Worse At Both Languages?|website=Fusion|access-date=2016-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without first understanding the culture and history of the region where Spanglish evolved as a practical matter an in depth familiarizing with multiple cultures. This knowledge, indeed the mere fact of one's having that knowledge, often forms an important part of both what one considers one's personal identity and what others consider one's identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=. "Poly-system repertoire and identity".|last=Halwachs,|first=Dieter|publisher=Grazer Linguistische|year=1993|isbn=|location=|pages=39–43 71–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other places where similar mixed codes are spoken are Gibraltar (''[[Llanito]]''), [[Belize]] (''Kitchen Spanish''), [[Aruba]], [[Bonaire]], and [[Curaçao]] (along with [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and [[Papiamento]]). {{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

==Usage==

===Spanglish patterns===

Spanglish is informal and lacks documented structure and rules, although speakers can consistently judge the grammaticality of a phrase or sentence. From a linguistic point of view, Spanglish often is mistakenly labeled many things. Spanglish is not a [[Creole language|creole]] or [[dialect]] of Spanish because, though people claim they are native Spanglish speakers, Spanglish itself is not a language on its own, but speakers speak English or Spanish with a heavy influence from the other language. The definition of Spanglish has been unclearly explained by scholars and linguists despite being noted so often. Spanglish is the fluid exchange of language between English and Spanish, present in the heavy influence in the words and phrases used by the speaker.&lt;ref&gt;Montes-Alcala, Cecilia, pg. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; Spanglish is currently considered a hybrid language by linguists—many actually refer to Spanglish as "Spanish-English [[code-switching]]", though there is some influence of [[Lexicalization|borrowing, and lexical and grammatical shifts]] as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Martínez|first1=Ramón Antonio|title="Spanglish" as Literacy Tool: Toward an Understanding of the potential Role of Spanish-English Code-Switching in the Development of Academic Literacy|date=2010|publisher=National Council of Teachers of English|location=Research in the Teaching of English|pages=124–129|edition=45.2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Individuals "communicate their thoughts and ideas using a combination of Spanish and English, often referring to this hybrid language practice as Spanglish."  Martinez, Ramon Antonio. https://www.jstor.org/stable/40997087?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents. Vol. Vol. 45. Austin: National Council of Teachers of English, 2010. 124-49. Print. No. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The inception of Spanglish is due to the influx of [[Latin American]] people into [[North America]], specifically the United States of America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Morales|first=Ed|title=Living in Spanglish: The Search for Latino Identity in America|year=2002|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=0312310005|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; As mentioned previously, the phenomenon of Spanglish can be separated into two different categories: [[Code-switching|code switching]] or [[Lexicalization|borrowing, and lexical and grammatical shifts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ardila|first=Alfredo|title=Spanglish: An Anglicized Spanish Dialect|journal=Hispanic Journal of Behavioral Sciences|date=February 2005|volume=27|issue=1|pages=60–81|doi=10.1177/0739986304272358}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Codeswitching has sparked controversy because it is seen "as a corruption of Spanish and English, a 'linguistic pollution' or 'the language of a "raced," underclass people'."&lt;ref&gt;Bonnie Urciuoli, [https://books.google.com/books?id=faAfAAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=urciuoli+1996&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwitzYDGmLTJAhXVWogKHVmoB7QQ6AEIIzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=raced&amp;f=false ''Exposing Prejudice: Puerto Rican Experiences of Language, Race, and Class''] (Boulder, Colo.: Westview Press, 1996), p. 38, cited by Arlene Dávila, [https://books.google.com/books?id=2E0rPRGz_bgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=davila+2012&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiW1P2XlLTJAhUB_R4KHXYIA2cQ6AEIHTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=raced&amp;f=false ''Latinos Inc.: The Marketing and Making of a People''] (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2012), p. 168, and quoted in turn by Viviana Rojas and Juan Piñón, [http://www.internationalhispanicmedia.org/spanish-english-spanglish-media-strategies-corporate-struggles-reach-second-later-generations-of-latinos/ "Spanish, English or Spanglish? Media Strategies and Corporate Struggles to Reach the Second and Later Generations of Latinos."] International Journal of Hispanic Media. N.p., Aug. 2014. Web. 04 Oct. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a fluent bilingual speaker addressing another bilingual speaker might engage in code switching with the sentence, "I'm sorry I cannot attend next week's meeting porque tengo una obligación de negocios en Boston, pero espero que I'll be back for the meeting the week after"—which means, "I'm sorry I cannot attend next week's meeting because I have a business obligation in Boston, but I hope to be back for the meeting the week after."

===Calques===
[[Calques]] are translations of entire words or phrases from one language into another. They represent the simplest forms of Spanglish, as they undergo no lexical or grammatical structural change.&lt;ref name="Stavans 2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stavans|first=Ilan | authorlink = Ilan Stavans|title=The gravitas of Spanglish|journal=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]|year=2000|volume=47|issue=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of calques is common throughout most languages, evident in the calques of Arabic exclamations used in Spanish.&lt;ref name="Montes-Alcala, pg. 107"&gt;Montes-Alcala, pg. 107&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples:
* "to call back"  → ''llamar p'atrás'' (volver a llamar)
* "It's up to you." → ''Está p'arriba de ti.'' (Depende de ti.)
* "to run for governor" → ''correr para gobernador'' (presentarse para gobernador)&lt;ref name="Montes-Alcala, pg. 107"/&gt;

===Semantic extensions===
Semantic extension or reassignment refers to a phenomenon where speakers use a word of language A (typically Spanish in this case) with the meaning of its cognate in language B (typically English), rather than its standard meaning in language A. In Spanglish this usually occurs in the case of "[[false friends]]" (similar to, but technically not the same as [[false cognates]]), where words of similar form in Spanish and English are thought to have like meanings based on their cognate relationship.&lt;ref name="Montes-Alcala, pg. 105"&gt;Montes-Alcala, pg. 105&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of this lexical phenomenon in Spanglish is the emergence of new verbs when the [[Productivity (linguistics)|productive]] Spanish verb-making suffix ''-ear'' is attached to an English verb. For example, the Spanish verb for "to eat lunch" (''almorzar'' in standard Spanish) becomes ''lonchear'' (occasionally ''lunchear''). The same process produces ''watchear'', &lt;!--- Include ''puchar'' here IF its meaning and English basis can be given. --&gt; ''parquear'', ''emailear'', ''twittear'', etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rothman|first=Jason|author2=Amy Beth Rell |title=A linguistic analysis of Spanglish: relating language to identity|journal=Linguistics and the Human Sciences|year=2005|volume=1|issue=3|pages=515–536|doi=10.1558/lhs.2005.1.3.515}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Loan words===
[[loanword|Loan words]] occur in any language due to the presence of items or ideas not present in the culture before, such as modern technology. The increasing rate of technological growth requires the use of loan words from the donor language due to the lack of its definition in the lexicon of the main language. This partially deals with the "prestige" of the donor language, which either forms a dissimilar or more similar word from the loan word. The growth of modern technology can be seen in the expressions: "hacer click" (to click), "mandar un e-mail" (to send an e-mail), "faxear" (to fax), "textear" (to text message), or "hacker" (hacker).  Some words borrowed from the donor languages are adapted to the language, while others remain unassimilated (e. g. "sandwich"). The items most associated with Spanglish refer to words assimilated into the main morphology.&lt;ref&gt;Montes-Alcala, pg. 106&lt;/ref&gt; Borrowing words from English and "Spanishizing" them has typically occurred through immigrants.&lt;ref name="The New York Times"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Alvarez|first1=Lizette|title=It’s the talk of Nueva York: The hybrid called Spanglish|publisher=The New York Times|date=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method makes new words by pronouncing an English word "Spanish style", thus dropping final consonants, softening others, and replacing certain consonants (i.e., M's, N's, V's) with B's.&lt;ref name="The New York Times"/&gt;

Examples: 
*"Aseguranza" (insurance)
*"Biles" (bills)
*"Chorcha" (church)
*"Ganga" (gang)
*"Líder" (leader) – considered an established Anglicism 
*"Lonchear/Lonchar" (to have lunch)
*"Marqueta" (market)
*"Taipear" (to type)
*"Troca" (truck) – Widely used in most of northern Mexico as well

=== Fromlostiano ===
[[Image:Spanglish Madrid Baidefeis.png|thumb|Spanish street ad in [[Madrid]] humorously showing ''baidefeis'' instead of the Spanish ''gratis'' (free).&lt;br&gt;''Baidefeis'' derives from the English "by the face"; Spanish: ''por la cara'', "free". The adoption of English words is very common in Spain.]]
Fromlostiano is a type of artificial and humorous [[wordplay]] that translates Spanish [[idiom]]s word-for-word into English. The name ''fromlostiano'' comes from the expression ''From Lost to the River'', which is a word-for-word translation of ''de perdidos al río''; an idiom that means that one is prone to choose a particularly risky action in a desperate situation (this is somewhat comparable to the English idiom ''in for a penny, in for a pound''). 
The humor comes from the fact that while the expression is completely grammatical in English, it makes no sense to a native English speaker. Hence it is necessary to understand both languages to appreciate the humor.

This phenomenon was first noted in the book ''From Lost to the River'' in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ochoa|first=Ignacio|title=From Lost to the River|date=1995|publisher=Publicaciones Formativas, S.A.|location=Madrid|isbn=978-84-920231-1-0|author2=Frederico López Socasau |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book describes six types of ''fromlostiano'':
# Translations of Spanish idioms into English: ''With you bread and onion'' (''Contigo pan y cebolla''), ''Nobody gave you a candle in this burial'' (''Nadie te ha dado vela en este entierro''), ''To good hours, green sleeves'' (''A buenas horas mangas verdes'').
# Translations of American and British celebrities' names into Spanish: ''Vanesa Tumbarroja'' (''Vanessa Redgrave'').
# Translations of American and British street names into Spanish: ''Calle del Panadero'' (''Baker Street'').
# Translations of Spanish street names into English: ''Shell Thorn Street'' (''Calle de Concha Espina'').
# Translations of multinational corporations' names into Spanish: ''Ordenadores Manzana'' (''Apple Computers'').
# Translations of Spanish [[minced oath]]s into English: ''Tu-tut that I saw you'' (''Tararí que te vi'').
The use of Spanglish has evolved over time. It has emerged as a way of conceptualizing one's thoughts whether it be in speech or on paper.

==Identity==
The use of Spanglish is often associated with an individual's association with identity (in terms of language learning) and reflects how many minority-American cultures feel toward their heritage. Commonly in ethnic communities within the United States, the knowledge of one's [[heritage language]] tends to assumably signify if one is truly of a member of their culture. Just as Spanish helps individuals identify with their Spanish identity, Spanglish is slowly becoming the poignant realization of the Hispanic-American, especially Mexican-American, identity within the United States. Individuals of Hispanic descent living in America face living in two very different worlds and need a new sense of bi-cultural and bilingual identity of their own experience. "This synergy of cultures and struggle with identity is reflected in language use and results in the mixing of Spanish and English." Spanglish is used to facilitate communication with others in both worlds; "...code-switching is not merely a random phenomena but rather a complex system composed of a variety". While some individuals believe that Spanglish should not be considered a language, it is a language that has evolved and is continuing to grow and affect the way new generations are educated, culture change, and the production of media.&lt;ref&gt;Rojas, Viviana, and Juan Piñón. "Spanish, English or Spanglish? Media Strategies and 
Corporate Struggles to Reach the Second and Later Generations of Latinos." 
International Journal of Hispanic Media. N.p., Aug. 2014. Web. 04 Oct. 2015.
&lt;/ref&gt; Living within the United States creates a synergy of culture and struggles for many Mexican-Americans. The hope to retain their cultural heritage/language and their dual-identity in American society is one of the major factors that lead to the creation of Spanglish.&lt;ref&gt;Rothman &amp; Rell 2005, pg. 527&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

;Literature
* [[H.G.Wells]], in his 1933 [[future history]] ''[[The Shape of Things to Come]]'', predicted that in the twenty first century English and Spanish would "become interchangeable languages".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brownbagebook.com/eBooks/HG-Wells/Shape-Things/chapter25.html H.G.Wells, ''The Shape of Things to Come'', Ch. 12] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510075432/http://www.brownbagebook.com/eBooks/HG-Wells/Shape-Things/chapter25.html |date=2011-05-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Music
The use of Spanglish by incorporating English and Spanish lyrics into music has risen in the United States over time. In the 1980s 1.2% of songs in the [[Billboard hot 100|Billboard Top 100]] contained Spanglish lyrics, eventually growing to 6.2% in the 2000s. The lyrical emergence of Spanglish by way of Latin-American Musicians has grown tremendously, reflective of the growing Hispanic population within the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Pisarek &amp; Valenzuela 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

{{italic title}}
'''''Suite for Barbara Loden''''' ([[French language|French]]: ''Supplément à la vie de Barbara Loden'') is a 2012 book by [[Nathalie Léger]]. The book was first offered in English translation by UK publishers Les Fugitives in 2015 with a translation by  Natasha Lehrer and Cécile Menon; the following year it was published in the U.S. by Dorothy, a publishing project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SUITE FOR BARBARA LODEN NATHALIE LÉGER|url=http://dorothyproject.com/?book=suite-for-barbara-loden|accessdate=30 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SUITE FOR BARBARA LODEN|url=http://www.lesfugitives.com/books/#/suite-for-barbara-loden/|accessdate=30 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Léger was inspired to write the piece after being asked to write an encyclopedia entry on [[Barbara Loden]]'s only film as director, the 1970 film ''[[Wanda (film)|Wanda]]''. Delving into research she found herself with enough material to write a short book, a mix of novel, biography, and art criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=DEMARCO|first1=AMANDA|title=SUITE FOR BARBARA LODEN BY NATHALIE LÉGER|url=http://therumpus.net/2015/06/suite-for-barbara-loden-by-nathalie-leger/|accessdate=30 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An excerpt from the book was published in the fall 2016 issue of ''[[The Paris Review]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Léger|first1=Nathalie|title=Barbara, Wanda|url=http://www.theparisreview.org/letters-essays/6820/barbara-wanda-nathalie-leger|accessdate=30 September 2016|work=The Paris Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Time travel]] is a common theme in [[fiction]] and has been [[List of time travel works of fiction|depicted in a variety of media]], such as literature, television, film, and advertisements.&lt;ref name="Nahin"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nahin|first1=Paul J.|title=Time Machines: Time Travel in Physics, Metaphysics, and Science Fiction|date=1999|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=9780387985718|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nahin|first1=Paul J.|title=Time Travel: A Writer's Guide to the Real Science of Plausible Time Travel|date=2011|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|isbn=1421401207|page=ix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Time travel#History of the time travel concept|concept of time travel by mechanical means]] was popularized in [[H. G.

Time travel in modern fiction is sometimes achieved by [[Wormhole|space and time warps]], stemming from the scientific theory of [[general relativity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Space and Time Warps|author=Stephen Hawking|date=1999|url=http://www.hawking.org.uk/space-and-time-warps.html|accessdate=February 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Time travel#History of the time travel concept|Stories from antiquity]] often featured time travel into the future through a [[#time slip|time slip]] brought on by traveling or sleeping,{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} or in other cases, time travel into the past through supernatural means, for example brought on by [[angel]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alkon|first1=Paul K.|title=Origins of Futuristic Fiction|date=1987|publisher=University of Georgia Press|location=Athens|isbn=082030932X|pages=95–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; or spirits.&lt;ref name="Kuiper"/&gt;

==Time travel themes==

===Changing the past===
The idea of changing the past is logically [[contradiction|contradictory]], and results in a [[grandfather paradox]].&lt;ref name="unchangeable"&gt;{{cite web|author=Norman Swartz|title=Time Travel: Visiting the Past|url=https://www.sfu.ca/~swartz/time_travel1.htm|date=1993|publisher=SFU.ca|accessdate=February 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul J. Nahin]], who has written extensively on the topic of time travel in fiction, states that "[e]ven though the consensus today is that the past cannot be changed, science fiction writers have used the idea of changing the past for good story effect".&lt;ref name="Nahin"/&gt;{{rp|267}} Time travel to the past and [[#Precognition|precognition]] without the ability to change events may result in [[causal loop]]s.&lt;ref name="Klosterman"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Klosterman|first1=Chuck|title=Eating the Dinosaur|date=2009|publisher=Scribner|location=New York|isbn=9781439168486|pages=60-62|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The possibility of characters inadvertently or intentionally changing the past also gave rise to the idea of "time police", people tasked with preventing such changes from occurring by themselves engaging in time travel to rectify such changes.&lt;ref name="Stableford"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stableford|first1=Brian|title=Science Fact and Science Fiction: An Encyclopedia|date=2006|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=0415974607|page=534}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Alternative future, history, timelines, and dimensions====
{{See also|Parallel universe (fiction)|Future history|Alternate history|:Category:Multiple time paths in fiction}}
An alternative future or alternate future is a possible [[future]] that never comes to pass, typically when someone travels back into the [[past]] and alters it so that the events of the alternative future cannot occur,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Prucher|first1=Jeffrey|last2=Wolfe|first2=Gene|title=Brave New Words: The Oxford Dictionary of Science Fiction|date=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=9780195305678|pages=4–5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iYzi8m8FbEsC&amp;pg=PA4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=4 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; or when a communication from the future to the past effected a change that alters the future.&lt;ref name="Nahin"/&gt;{{rp|165}} Alternative histories may exist "side by side", with the time traveller actually arriving at different dimensions as he changes time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Journeys in Space and Time|episode-link=|url=|accessdate=|series=[[Cosmos: A Personal Voyage]]|series-link=|first=|last=|network=[[PBS]]|station=|date=November 16, 1980|season=|series-no=|number=8|minutes=|time=36 minute mark|transcript=|transcript-url=|quote=|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Butterfly effect====
The [[butterfly effect]] is the notion that small events can have large, widespread consequences. The term describes events observed in [[chaotic systems|chaos theory]] where a very small change in initial conditions results in vastly different outcomes. The term was coined by mathematician [[Edward Norton Lorenz|Edward Lorenz]] years after the phenomenon was first described.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hilborn|first1=Robert C.|title=Sea gulls, butterflies, and grasshoppers: A brief history of the butterfly effect in nonlinear dynamics|journal=[[American Journal of Physics]]|date=April 2004|volume=72|issue=4|pages=425–427|doi=10.1119/1.1636492|bibcode=2004AmJPh..72..425H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The butterfly effect has found its way into popular imagination. For example, in Ray Bradbury's 1952 short story ''[[A Sound of Thunder]]'', the killing of a single insect millions of years in the past drastically changes the world, and in the 2004 film ''[[The Butterfly Effect]]'', the protagonist's small changes to their past results in extreme changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archive.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2008/06/08/the_meaning_of_the_butterfly/?page=full|title=The meaning of the butterfly|author=Peter Dizikes|date=June 8, 2008|work=Boston Globe|accessdate=May 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communication from the future===
In literature, [[communication]] from the future as a [[plot device]] is encountered in various [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] stories. [[Forrest J. Ackerman]] noted in his 1973 anthology of the best fiction of the year that "[t]he theme of getting hold of tomorrow's newspaper is a recurrent one".&lt;ref name="Ackerman"&gt;[[Forrest J. Ackerman]], ed., ''Best Science Fiction for 1973'' (1973), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; An early example of this device can be found in the [[H.G. Wells]] 1932 [[short story]] "[[The Queer Story of Brownlow's Newspaper]]",&lt;ref name="Ackerman"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks06/0601931h.html|title=The Queer Story of Brownlow's Newspaper|publisher=Gutenberg.net.au|date=1971-11-10|accessdate=2015-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; which tells the tale of a man who receives such a paper from 40 years in the future. The 1944 film ''[[It Happened Tomorrow]]'' also employs this device,&lt;ref name="Ackerman"/&gt; with the protagonist receiving the next day's newspaper from an elderly colleague (who is possibly a ghost). Ackerman's anthology also highlights a short story by [[Robert Silverberg]], "What We Learned From This Morning's Newspaper".&lt;ref name="Ackerman"/&gt; In that story, a block of homeowners wake to discover that on November 22, they have received the ''New York Times'' for the coming December 1.&lt;ref name="Nahin"/&gt;{{rp|38}} As characters learn of future events affecting them through a newspaper delivered a week early, the ultimate effect is that this "so upsets the future that spacetime is destroyed".&lt;ref name="Nahin"/&gt;{{rp|165}} The television series ''[[Early Edition]]'', inspired by the film ''It Happened Tomorrow'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Young|first1=R.G.|title=The Encyclopedia of Fantastic Film: Ali Baba to Zombies|date=1997|publisher=Applause|location=New York|isbn=1557832692|page=318}}&lt;/ref&gt; also revolved around a character who daily received the next day's newspaper,&lt;ref name="Nahin"/&gt;{{rp|235}} and sought to change some event therein forecast to happen.

A newspaper from the future can be a fictional edition of a real newspaper, or an entirely [[List of fictional newspapers|fictional newspaper]]. [[John Buchan]]'s novel ''[[The Gap in the Curtain]]'', is similarly premised on a group of people being enabled to see, for a moment, an item in ''[[The Times|Times]]'' newspaper from one year in the future. During the [[Swedish general election, 2006|Swedish general election of 2006]], the [[Liberal People's Party (Sweden)|Swedish liberal party]] used election posters which looked like news items, called ''Framtidens nyheter'' ("News of the future"), featuring things that Sweden in the future had become what the party wanted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/fp-satsar-pa-lopsedlar-som-valaffischer/|title=Fp satsar på löpsedlar som valaffischer|publisher=Dagens nyheter|language=Swedish|trans-title=FP focuses on headlines as election posters|author=Gunnar Jonsson|date=29 June 2006|accessdate=9 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A communication from the future raises questions about the ability of humans to control their destiny.&lt;ref name="Nahin"/&gt;{{rp|165}} If the recipient is allowed to presume that the future is malleable, and if the future forecast affects them in some way, then this device serves as a convenient explanation of their [[motivation]]s. In ''It Happened Tomorrow'', the events that are described in the newspaper do come to pass, and the protagonist's efforts to avoid those events set up circumstances which instead cause them to come about.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} By contrast, in ''Early Edition'', the protagonist is able to successfully prevent catastrophes predicted in the newspaper, although if the protagonist does nothing, these catastrophes do come about.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Where such a device is used, the source of the future news may not be explained, leaving it open to the reader or watcher to imagine that it might be technology, magic, an act of a god etc.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} In the H.G. Wells story,&lt;!--what story ?--&gt; the author writes of the newspaper that "apparently it had been delivered not by the postman, but by some other hand".{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} As in ''It Happened Tomorrow'' and ''Early Edition'', no explanation is offered for the source of the future news. Ackerman suggests that "[t]he longer that authors mush on with the tale of... the next-week's-newspaper-now, the more difficult it becomes to pull a new rarebit out of the hat".&lt;ref name="Ackerman"/&gt;

===Precognition===
[[Precognition]] has been explored as a form of time travel in fiction. Author [[J. B. Priestley]] wrote of it both in fiction and non-fiction, analysing testimonials of precognition and other "temporal anomalies" in his book ''Man and Time''. His books include time travel to the future through dreaming, which upon waking up results in memories from the future. Such memories, he writes, may also lead to the feeling of ''[[déjà vu]]'', that the present events have already been experienced, and are now being re-experienced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Price|first1=Katy|title=Testimonies of precognition and encounters with psychiatry in letters to J. B. Priestley|journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part C: Studies in History and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences|date=December 2014|volume=48|pages=103–111|doi=10.1016/j.shpsc.2014.07.006|pmid=25176614}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infallible precognition, which describes the future as it truly is, leads to [[causal loop]]s, a form of which is explored in [[Newcomb's paradox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Craig|first1=William Lane|title=Divine Foreknowledge and Newcomb's Paradox|journal=Philosophia|date=October 1987|volume=17|issue=3|pages=331–350|doi=10.1007/BF02455055|url=http://www.leaderu.com/offices/billcraig/docs/newcomb.html|accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dummett|first1=Michael|title=The Seas of Language|date=1993|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780198240112|pages=356, 370-375|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film ''[[12 Monkeys (film)|12 Monkeys]]'' heavily deals with themes of predestination and the [[Cassandra (metaphor)|Cassandra complex]], where the protagonist who travels back in time explains that he can't change the past.&lt;ref name="Klosterman"/&gt;

===Time loop===
{{See also|Time loop|List of films featuring time loops}}
A "time loop" or "temporal loop" is a [[plot device]] in which periods of time are repeated and re-experienced by the characters, and there is often some hope of breaking out of the cycle of repetition.&lt;ref name="sfencyclopedia"&gt;{{cite web|author=Chelsea Quinn Yarbro|url=http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/time_loop|title=Time Loop|publisher=[[The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction]]|date=|accessdate=2015-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Time loops are sometimes referred to as [[causal loop]]s,&lt;ref name="Klosterman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sfencyclopedia"/&gt; but these two concepts are distinct. Although similar, causal loops are unchanging and self-originating, whereas time loops are constantly resetting. In a time loop when a certain condition is met, such as a death of a character or a clock reaching a certain time, the loop starts again, with one or more characters retaining the memories from the previous loop.&lt;ref name="Jones"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Matthew|authorlink1=Matt Jones (writer)|last2=Ormrod|first2=Joan|title=Time Travel in Popular Media: Essays on Film, Television, Literature and Video Games|date=2015|publisher=[[McFarland &amp; Company]]|isbn=0786478071|page=207}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stories with time loops commonly center on the character learning from each successive loop through time.&lt;ref name="sfencyclopedia"/&gt;

===Time paradox===
{{further|Temporal paradox}}
Many time travel works explore the topic of disrupting causality leading to time paradoxes. One of the most commonly referred to in time travel literature is known as the [[grandfather paradox]]. Many works of fiction explore what would happen if a time traveller went back in time and changed the past, for example if they killed their own grandparents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Langford|first1=David|authorlink=David Langford|url=http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/time_paradoxes|title=Time Paradoxes|publisher=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction|date=|accessdate=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Time slip===
{{main|Time slip}}
A time slip is a [[plot device]] used in [[fantasy]] and [[science fiction]] in which a person, or group of people, seem to [[time travel|travel through time]] by unknown means for a period of time.&lt;ref name="io9._Time"&gt;{{cite web|title=Timeslip romance|author=Charlie Jane Anders|work=io9|date=2009-06-12|accessdate=2015-08-27|url=http://io9.com/tag/timeslip-romance}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Palmer"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Palmer|first1=Christopher|title=Philip K.

The difference is that in time slip stories, the protagonist typically has no control and no understanding of the process (which is often never explained at all) and is either left marooned in a past time and must make the best of it, or is eventually returned by a process as unpredictable and uncontrolled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schweitzer|first1=Darrell|title=The Fantastic Horizon: Essays and Reviews|date=2009|publisher=Borgo Press|location=Rockville, Maryland|isbn=9781434403209|page=112|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HG-vjhQqE_cC&amp;pg=PA112|accessdate=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plot device is also popular in children's literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lucas|first1=Ann Lawson|title=The Presence of the Past in Children's Literature|date=2003|publisher=Praeger|location=Westport, Connecticut|isbn=9780313324833|page=113|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3mBA_EHrxvEC&amp;pg=PA153&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cosslett|first1=Tess|title="History from Below": Time-Slip Narratives and National Identity|journal=The Lion and the Unicorn|date=1 April 2002|volume=26|issue=2|pages=243–253|doi=10.1353/uni.2002.0017|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/35545/pdf|accessdate=22 September 2017|issn=1080-6563}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Time slips featuring a child and a realistic depiction of an earlier period enjoyed a vogue in the UK in the mid-20th century.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} Successful examples include [[Alison Uttley]]'s ''A Traveller in Time'' (1939) going back to the time of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]]; [[Philippa Pearce]]'s ''[[Tom's Midnight Garden]]'' (1958) returning to the 1880s and 1890s; [[Barbara Sleigh]]'s ''[[Jessamy]]'' (1967) and Penelope Farmer's ''[[Charlotte Sometimes (novel)|Charlotte Sometimes]]'', both slipping back to the period of the [[First World War]]; [[Ruth Park]]'s ''[[Playing Beatie Bow]]'' (1980), where the slip in [[Sydney]], Australia, is to the squalor of 1873; and [[Helen Cresswell]]'s ''[[Moondial]]'', where three times periods are involved (1988, also televised).{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

===Time tourism===
A "distinct subgenre" of stories explore the possibility that time travel might be used as a means of tourism,&lt;ref name="Kuiper"/&gt; with travelers curious to visit periods or events such as the [[Victorian Era]], [[Crucifixion of Christ]], or some point where [[dinosaur]]s could be watched (or hunted by [[big game hunter]]s), or to meet historical figures such as [[Abraham Lincoln]] or [[Ludwig van Beethoven]].&lt;ref name="Stableford"/&gt; This theme can be addressed from two directions. An early example of present-day tourists travelling back to the past is [[Ray Bradbury]]{{'}}s ''A Sound of Thunder'' (1952), in which the protagonists are [[big game hunter]]s who travel to the distant past to hunt dinosaurs.&lt;ref name="Kuiper"/&gt; An early example of the other type, in which tourists from the future visit the present, is [[Catherine L. Moore]] and [[Henry Kuttner]]{{'}}s ''[[Vintage Season]]'' (1946), a story which was selected for inclusion in Volume Two of ''[[The Science Fiction Hall of Fame, Volume Two|The Science Fiction Hall of Fame]]'' collection.&lt;ref name="Bova"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bova|first1=Ben|title=[[The Science Fiction Hall of Fame, Volume Two]]|date=2003|publisher=[[Tor Books]]|location=New York|isbn=9780765305343|pages=ix-xi|edition=1st|chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immortality===
{{Unsourced section|date=October 2018}}
Instances of immortality are prevalent in time travel fiction. Oxford defines immortality as "the ability to live forever; eternal life." A distinct sub-thematic characteristic is warnings of said time-traveling immortals to other characters about the dangers of time travel. Some examples are 4th dimensional beings from ''[[Rick and Morty]]'', Professor Paradox from ''[[Ben 10]]'', and the Doctor from ''[[Doctor Who]]''.

===Time war===
{{See also|:Category:Temporal war fiction}}
''[[The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction]]'' describes a time war as a fictional war that is "fought across time, usually with each side knowingly using time travel ... in an attempt to establish the ascendancy of one or another version of history". Time wars are also known as "change wars" and "temporal wars".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Langford|first1=David|authorlink=David Langford|title=Changewar|url=http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/changewar|website=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction|accessdate=November 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul J. Nahin|P. Nahin]] compiles a variety of examples of fictional works that raise issues framed as arising in a time war:

{{quote|Consider this passage from ''[[The Fall of Chronopolis]]'' (Bayley), a novel about a "time-war." Just after the detection of temporal invaders, we read of them that "They had come in from the future at high speed, too fast for defensive time-blocks to be set up, and had only been detected by ground-based stations deep in historical territory. If the target was to alter past events—the usual strategy in a time-war—then the empire's chronocontinuity would be significantly interfered with." And in ''Time of the Fox'' (Costello), American physicists battle KGB physicists in a war of time travelers in the past, each side attempting to change history to its advantage. In this novel the history changers isolate themselves from all the alterations taking place outside of their Time Lab, and they compare their stored historical records with those of external libraries. That allows the staff historian to adjust for each new round of changes. As the historian explains, outside of the Time Lab "History might change, but here [in the Time Lab] the past lives on."

In a novel of a galaxy-wide confrontation between humans and [[android (robot)|androids]]—''Time and Again'' (Simak)—the use of time travel to alter history is central: "A war in time ... would reach back to win its battles. It would strike at points in time and space which would not even know that there was a war. It could, logically, go back to the silver mines of Athens, to the horse and chariot of Thut- mosis III, to the sailing of Columbus. ... It would twist the fabric of the past."&lt;ref name="Nahin"/&gt;{{rp|267}}}}

===Hitler and World War II===
In Western fiction, one common use of time travel technology is to travel back in time and attempt to kill [[Adolf Hitler]] in an attempt to avoid [[World War II]] and the [[Holocaust]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Burnett |first1=Dean |title=Time travellers: please don’t kill Hitler |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2014/feb/21/time-travellers-kill-adolf-hitler |accessdate=October 26, 2018 |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=February 21, 2014 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fiction that applies the [[Novikov self-consistency principle]] that the past can't be changed results in plots where attempts to assassinate Hitler or avert the war are destined to fail, or where they actually result in the rise of Hitler as history records it.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} Fiction that does allow the past to be changed often explores the unintended consequences of time travel or the [[butterfly effect]], which result in Germany and Japan winning World War II.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} This outcome is also explored in parallel world fiction such as ''[[The Man in the High Castle]]''.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}
