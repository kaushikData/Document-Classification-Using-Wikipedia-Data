      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5978">'''A.G. Syjuco''' (born Augusto Cesare Amado R. Syjuco in August 1980) is a music producer, composer, and musician originally from [[Manila]], [[Philippines]]. He is the eldest son of [[avant-garde]] artists [[Cesare Syjuco]] and [[Jean Marie Syjuco]] and is the producer, principal composer, and primary instrumentalist  of the experimental rock band Jack of None.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jackofnone.net/|title=Jack of None|website=Jackofnone.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the lead guitarist and composer for the art-rock band FAUST! at age 15. The band was discovered by MTV Asia in 1996 and quickly signed to a major label. FAUST! released two albums that included ''My Secret Identity'' (MSI) in 1998 — which was arguably the first full-length album in the Philippines to be released for free on the Internet by a group of commercially signed recording artists - and disbanded shortly after.  A.G. took a hiatus from the music industry for eight years, and during this period he graduated valedictorian (Summa Cum Laude) with a bachelor's degree in Information Technology from San Beda College Alabang.  &lt;ref name="philstar.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.philstar.com/opinion/2011/01/05/645051/cruz-syjuco-achievers-ingrid-rey-resume-journey|title=Cruz, Syjuco: Achievers /Ingrid, Rey resume journey|website=Philstar.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://chuvaness.com/tag/philippine-star/|title=philippine star - Chuvaness.com|website=Chuvaness.com|accessdate=3 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pinoyalbums.com/45011/faust-toons-from-an-alien-broadcast/|title=Faust – Toons From An Alien Broadcast|website=Pinoyalbums.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.flyahmagazine.com/2016/06/jack-of-none-cool-and-unique.html|title=Jack of None cool and unique|website=Flyah Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''A House-Boat on the Styx''''' is a fantasy novel written by [[John Kendrick Bangs]] in 1895.

The original full title was ''A House-Boat on the Styx: Being Some Account of the Divers Doings of the Associated Shades''. The novel was first published by Harper Brothers in 1896 with illustrations by [[Peter Newell]] (24 plates).&lt;ref name=HDL&gt;[https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/001027045 Catalog record (New York: Harper, 1896)]. HathiTrust Digital Library. Retrieved 2016-08-04. &lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; Contents and Illustrations, pp. v-viii, list 12 chapters and 24 plates. The illustrations are not credited but they are clearly signed by Peter Newell, the credited illustrator of the sequels.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==

The premise of the book is that everyone who has ever died (up to the time in which the book is set, which seems to be about the time of its publication) has gone to [[Styx (mythology)|Styx]], the river that circles the underworld.

The book begins with [[Charon (mythology)|Charon]], ferryman of the Styx being startled&amp;mdash;and annoyed&amp;mdash;by the arrival of a [[houseboat]] on the Styx. At first afraid that the boat will put him out of business, he later finds out that he is actually to be appointed the boat's [[janitor]].

What follows are eleven more stories (for a total of twelve) which are set on the house boat. There is no central theme, and the purpose of the book appears to be as a literary [[thought experiment]] to see what would happen if various famous dead people were put in the same room with each other. Each chapter is a short story featuring various souls from history and mythology. In the twelfth chapter the house boat disappears, leading into the [[sequel]], ''[[The Pursuit of the House-Boat]]''.

==Notes==
''A House-Boat on the Styx'' appears to have no original fictional characters in it.  All are borrowed&amp;mdash;with varying degrees of licence&amp;mdash;from either history or mythology.

Bangs' idea of setting people in the afterlife (called [[Bangsian fantasy]] after his name) is quite similar to a book called ''[[God Bless You, Dr. Kevorkian]]'' by [[Kurt Vonnegut]].

Throughout the book, there is a running joke that Shakespeare didn't actually write any of his own plays, that they were actually ghostwritten by [[Sir Francis Bacon]], [[Sir Walter Raleigh]], and other contemporaries.  Will always tries to change the subject quickly when authorship comes into conversation.

''Heroes in Hell'', the first book in a series of [[fantasy]] short story collections by various authors, has a similar, albeit more modern, theme.

[[Philip José Farmer]]'s [[Riverworld]] series is similar in that the main characters are, for the most part, historical figures who are resurrected on a planet with one great river winding around it, and Farmer credited the book as one of his inspirations for the series.&lt;ref name="farmer1"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=j7o9Cb-CzR8C&amp;pg=PA70#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Magic Labyrinth of Philip José Farmer], p. 70-71 (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was on the ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' list of [[Publishers Weekly list of bestselling novels in the United States in the 1890s#1896|10 best-selling novels in the US, 1896]].

'''Altruistic suicide''' is sacrifice of one's life to save or benefit others, for the good of the group, or to preserve the traditions and honor of a society. It is always intentional. '''Benevolent suicide''' refers to the [[self sacrifice]] of one's own life for the sake of the greater good.&lt;ref name="Smedes1989"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lewis B. Smedes|title=Mere Morality: What God Expects from Ordinary People|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IDC-50N-VDwC&amp;pg=PA114|date=9 March 1989|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|isbn=978-0-8028-0257-6|pages=114–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such sacrifice may be for the sake of executing a particular action, or for the sake of keeping a natural balance in the society. It is a theme or concept of a custom of [[sacrifice]] typically found within certain types of [[science fiction]] stories. However, real examples of these customs have been recorded to exist among some indigenous people, such as certain [[Inuit]] tribes.  This was seen by [[Émile Durkheim]] in his study ''[[Suicide (book)|Suicide]]'' as the product of over-integration with society.&lt;ref name="Barry1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert L. Barry|title=Breaking the Thread of Life: On Rational Suicide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BU4XAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA13|date=1 January 1996|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=978-1-56000-923-8|pages=13–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jensen2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven J.

In contrast a "sacrifice" committed by force of a [[State (polity)|state]] is instead referred to as [[eugenics]] or [[mass murder]], but may be otherwise referred to as "enforced population limits" or "population control". In literature, examples may promote the concept as a means for ending enduring types of social [[Group conflict|conflict]], or else deride the concept as an example of a [[dystopian]] future society.&lt;ref name="Ket"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rysa Ket|title=ReadOn|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mlw8AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PT223|publisher=Rysa|pages=1–|id=GGKEY:PJG0JH7UBZD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rituals==
If a person ends their life willingly it is not seen as a tragic death. [[Émile Durkheim]] notes that in some cultures there is a duty to intentionally commit ritual suicide.  A Japanese [[Samurai]] intentionally ends life (Seppuku) to preserve [[honor]] and to avoid disgrace. [[India]]n, Japanese, and other [[widows]] sometimes participate in an end of life ritual after the death of a husband, although Westernized populations have abandoned this practice. The elderly members of certain cultures intentionally ended their lives, in what is termed as [[senicide]]. In [[hunter-gatherer]] societies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Geronticide: Killing the Elderly
|author=Brogden, Michael |location=London and Philadelphia |publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers Ltd.|year=2001|page=57|isbn=1-85302-709-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; death "was determined for the elderly ... normally characterised by a liminal period and ceremonies in which the old person was transferred from the present world to the next." Durkheim also observes that altruistic suicide is unlikely to occur much in contemporary Western society where "individual personality is increasingly freed from the collective personality".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Lecture on Emile Durkheim|url=http://home.ku.edu.tr/~dyukseker/lecture-durkheim2-05.doc|author=Deniz Yükseker}}&lt;/ref&gt; Altruistic suicide has been described as an [[evolutionarily stable strategy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Suicide as an evolutionarily stable strategy|first=Steven |last=Mascaro |author2=Kevin B. Korb |author3=Ann E. Nicholson  |journal=Lecture Notes in Computer Science |volume=2159 |year=2001|url=http://www.springerlink.com/index/dq0nchqjf0n2n2q7.pdf |pages=120–132 |doi=10.1007/3-540-44811-X_12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Altruistic suicide has a long history in India, even being noted in the [[Dharmashastras]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Altruistic suicide in India|first= Lakshmi  |last=Vijayakumar|journal=Archives of Suicide Research |date=January 2004 |issue=8| volume=1 |pages=73–80 |url=http://www.informaworld.com/index/714860330.pdf |doi=10.1080/13811110490243804 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some perceive [[self-immolation]] as an altruistic or "worthy" suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Loren |last=Coleman |title=The Copycat Effect: How the Media and Popular Culture Trigger the Mayhem in Tomorrow's Headlines |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3B4lTTZE58oC&amp;pg=PA48 |location=New York |publisher=Paraview Pocket-Simon and Schuster |year=2004 |page=48 |isbn=0-7434-8223-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emergencies==
In contemporary Western society, this is seldom referred to as [[suicide]], and most often referred to as [[heroism]]. This only exists in times of emergency, and is always lauded, and is perceived as tragic death. Self-sacrificial acts of heroism, such as [[falling on a grenade]] is one example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Death by hand grenade: altruistic suicide in combat |first=JA |last=Blake |journal=Suicide &amp; life-threatening behavior |date=Spring 1978 |volume=8 |pages=46–59 |pmid=675772}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Intentionally remaining on deck of a sinking ship to leave room in the life rafts (for women and children), intentionally ending one's life to preserve the resources (fuel and food) of a group in the face of deprivation and the like are suicidal acts of heroism. [[Firefighters]], law-enforcement individuals, [[undercover agents]], sailors, and [[soldiers]] more often are at risk of opportunities for this form of unplanned self-sacrifice. These are all as a result of tragic, life-threatening, emergencies. It is only an emergency measure, a willing, yet unintentional end to the person's life. It is never as a result of a planned action, yet may involve some planning.

==In popular culture==
* In [[Dan Brown]]'s book ''[[Inferno (Brown novel)|Inferno]]'', Professor [[Robert Langdon]] stumbles upon an article entitled "W.H.O. needs Agathusia" (see above), dealing with the sacrifice that is required of a part of the world's population, in order to ensure the human race's survival in the face of imminent [[resource depletion]] and [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]].&lt;ref name="Brown2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dan Brown|title=Inferno|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MV4uCAAAQBAJ|date=14 May 2013|publisher=Doubleday}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In real life the group ''[[Voluntary Human Extinction Movement]]'' ("VHEMT") does not promote direct suicide but not having any descendant among its affiliates, as an altruistic way to avoid suffering and more damages to thousands of other sentient species and also to millions of unborn human beings. It is a kind of "genetic suicide" (placing an end to the "selfish gene" stigma) in order that persons and animals already living may enjoy better conditions and more natural space.
* "[[Children of the Corn]]", a Stephen King short story in which all the children must offer themselves up to sacrifice when they are 18 years of age.
* ''[[Logan's Run]]'' (1967 novel and 1976 film), in which all are mandated to be terminated upon reaching the age of 21 years (30 in the film). The [[dystopian]] theme is a [[Cold War]] allegory, asserting the nature of the "[[East-West dichotomy|East and West]]" contrast as one of [[totalitarianism]] versus [[Freedom (political)|freedom]], as these manifest as artificial and natural drives, respectively.

* The [[Isaac Asimov]] novel ''[[Pebble in the Sky]]''&amp;mdash;In a distant future, [[Earth]] is [[radioactive]] and all inhabitants are [[euthanasia|euthanized]] at the age of sixty to keep the population under control.

Eventually, the team reveals the truth, and improves the field so that the population can age and increase normally.
* In [[Lois Lowry]]'s novel ''[[The Giver]]'', the protagonist is a young boy living in a seemingly utopian future society which suppresses strong emotions. He has been taught that the elderly (and other "unfit" people) are "released" at a certain age to live outside the community, but eventually learns that they actually are being euthanized. This is meant to eradicate grief by making death normal and monotonous, but ends up making people numb to the horror.

In the field of [[computer security]], Anderson's rule refers to a principle formulated by [[Ross J. Anderson]]: by their nature large [[database]]s will never be free of abuse by breaches of security. If a large system is designed for ease of access it becomes insecure; if made watertight it becomes impossible to use.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/henryporter/2009/aug/10/id-card-database-breach Guardian newspaper article on a security breach, in which Anderson's Rule is formulated]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[geometry]], an '''apeirogon''' (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word ἄπειρος ''apeiros'', "infinite, boundless" and γωνία ''gonia'', "angle") is a generalized [[polygon]] with a [[countable set|countably]] infinite number of sides.&lt;ref&gt;Coxeter, Regular polytopes, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; It can be considered as the limit of an ''n''-sided polygon as ''n'' approaches infinity. The [[interior (topology)|interior]] of a linear apeirogon can be defined by a direction order of vertices, and defining half the plane as the interior.

This article describes an '''apeirogon''' in its linear form as a [[tessellation]] or partition of a [[line (geometry)|line]].

==Regular apeirogon==
A '''regular apeirogon''' has equal edge lengths, just like any [[regular polygon]], {p}. Its [[Schläfli symbol]] is {∞}, and its [[Coxeter–Dynkin diagram]] is {{CDD|node_1|infin|node}}. It is the first in the dimensional family of regular [[hypercubic honeycomb]]s.

This line may be considered as a [[circle]] of infinite radius, by analogy with regular polygons with great number of edges, which resemble a circle.

In two dimensions, a regular apeirogon divides the plane into two half-planes as a regular [[apeirogonal dihedron]]. The interior of an apeirogon can be defined by its orientation, filling one half plane. [[Dual polyhedron|Dually]] the [[apeirogonal hosohedron]] has digon faces and an apeirogonal vertex figure, {2, ∞}. A truncated apeirogonal hosohedron becomes a [[apeirogonal prism]], with each vertex bounded by two squares and an apeirogon. An alternated apeirogonal prism is a [[apeirogonal antiprism]], with each vertex bounded by three triangles and an apeirogon.

==Irregular apeirogon==

An '''isogonal apeirogon''' has a single type of vertex and alternates two types of edges.

A '''quasiregular apeirogon''' is an isogonal apeirogon with equal edge lengths.

An '''isotoxal apeirogon''', being the dual of an isogonal one, has one type of edge, and two types of vertices, and is therefore geometrically identical to the regular apeirogon. It can be shown seen by drawing vertices in alternate colors.

All of these will have half the symmetry (double the fundamental domain sizes) of the regular apeirogon.

== In hyperbolic plane==

[[File:Hyperbolic apeirogon example.png|250px|thumb|an apeirogon and circumscribed [[horocycle]] ]]

Apeirogons in the [[hyperbolic plane]], most notably the ''regular apeirogon'', {∞}, can have a curvature just like finite polygons of the Euclidean plane, with the vertices circumscribed by [[horocycle]]s or [[Hypercycle (geometry)|hypercycles]] rather than [[circle]]s.

Regular apeirogons that are scaled to converge at infinity have the symbol {∞} and exist on horocycles, while more generally they can exist on hypercycles.

The regular tiling {∞, 3} has regular apeirogon faces. Hypercyclic apeirogons can also be isogonal or quasiregular, with truncated apeirogon faces, t{∞}, like the tiling tr{∞,3}, with two types of edges, alternately connecting to triangles or other apeirogons.

{{wiktionary|boast}}
{{wikiquote}}
'''Boasting''' is to speak with excessive [[pride]] and self-satisfaction about one’s achievements, possessions, or abilities. This is also known as "bragging rights", which are not cancelled out by another individual's objection to said bragging rights. For example, when a young woman allegedly stopped a driver from crossing a railroad track when the train was approaching and there were no visible warnings of its approach, her rights to brag were not thwarted when another individual attempted to dispute the validity of her heroic act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Boast|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/boast|publisher=Oxford Dictionary|accessdate=November 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boasting occurs when someone feels a sense of satisfaction or when someone feels that whatever occurred proves their superiority and is recounting accomplishments so that others will feel admiration or [[envy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Nina|title=Coping with Infuriating, Mean, Critical People: The Destructive Narcissistic Pattern|date=2006|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9780313070402|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals construct an image of themselves, a personal identity, and present themselves in a manner that is consistent with that image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Schlenker | first=Barry R. | year=1980 | title=Impression Management: The Self-Concept, Social Identity, and Interpersonal Relations | publisher=Brooks/Cole | location=Monterey/California}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Theodore Millon]] theorized that in [[Impression management#Self-presentation|self-presentation]], individuals seek to balance boasting against discrediting themselves with excessive self-promotion or being caught blatantly misrepresenting themselves. Studies show that people often have a limited ability to perceive how their efforts at self-presentation are actually impacting their acceptance and likeability by others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Millon|first1=Theodore|title=Handbook of Psychology, Personality and Social Psychology|date=2003|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9780471384045|page=337}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Forms of Bragging ==
Although a brag can be as straightforward as a simple claim to riches or greatness, it often assumes [https://www.lesspenguiny.com/articles/best-article-on-bragging#iii-the-17-modes-of-bragging a variety of more subtle forms] in order to shield the speaker from any opprobrium they might otherwise receive for transgressing the social norms of humility. The most popular of these forms is the humblebrag, a term coined by comedian [[Harris Wittels]], whereby the brag is masked in a complaint. For example: “Dating websites are so much work. Every time I log in, I have like 100 new messages.”

==Religious teachings==
'''Christian bible:''' ''Thus says the Lord: “Let not the wise man boast in his wisdom, let not the mighty man boast in his might, let not the rich man boast in his riches'' (Jeremiah 9:23 ESV).

'''Quran''': ''Verily, Allâh does not like such as are proud and boastful; Those who are miserly and enjoin miserliness on other men and hide what Allâh has bestowed upon them of His Bounties'' (The Noble Qur'an 4:36-37).

'''Hindu Wisdom:'''  ''Whereas, in our Occident, the most dry and sterile minds brag in front of Nature'' (La Bible de l'Humanite in Oeuvres).

==Society and culture==
{{Expand section|date=November 2015}}
The Ancient Greek book ''The Characters of [[Theophrastus]]'' devotes a chapter to "The Boastful Man".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Theophrastus |title=The Characters of Theophrastus: An English Tr. from a Rev. Text |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GOhfAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA192 |accessdate=November 13, 2015 |year=1870 |publisher=Macmillan &amp; Company |page=192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Beot|Bēot]]'' is [[Old English]] for a ritualized boast, vow, threat or promise, which was usually made by an Anglo-Saxon warrior on the eve of or during battle. Bēots can be found in the epic poem ''[[Beowulf]]'', including by the hero himself.

A ''[[Gab (song)|gab]]'' ([[Old Occitan]] [ˈɡap] for "boast") is a [[troubadour]] boasting song.

Boasting and bragging are necessary components of maintaining "[[Face (sociological concept)|Face]]" in some Arab societies.&lt;ref&gt;''CIA:  Concepts of "Face"'' https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/kent-csi/vol8no3/html/v08i3a05p_0001.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fictional characters noted for their boasting===
* [[Miles Gloriosus]], a stock character from ancient Roman comedy
* [[Rodomonte]], a major character in the Italian romantic [[Epic poetry|epic poems]] ''[[Orlando innamorato]]'' by [[Matteo Maria Boiardo]] and ''[[Orlando furioso]]'' by [[Ludovico Ariosto]], which gave rise to the word [[rodomontade]], meaning "boastful, bragging talk"
* [[Scaramouche]], a stock clown character in Italian [[commedia dell'arte]]
* [[Falstaff]], in three of [[William Shakespeare]]'s plays
* [[Baron Munchausen]], a baron made famous by the novel of [[Rudolf Raspe]] who enjoys telling fantastical and absurd stories about his adventures abroad. He was based on a real-life German baron who was known for his exaggerated tales.
* ''[[The Twelve Idle Servants]]'', a fairy tale by [[The Brothers Grimm]] about twelve servants who boast about their incredible laziness.
* [[Daffy Duck]]: American cartoon character who often brags about himself. In all of the cartoons he appeared in since the 1950s, he is usually victim of his own overestimations.
* [[Lambik]]: A Belgian comics character who often sees himself as smart, strong, attractive and a born leader, but is actually neither of those things.
* [[Odd Della Robbia]], one of the main characters of the French animated series ''[[Code Lyoko]]''.

In [[social science]], the term '''built environment''', or '''built world''', refers to the [[human impact on the environment|human-made surroundings]] that provide the setting for [[human behavior|human activity]], ranging in scale from buildings to parks. It has been defined as "the human-made space in which people live, work, and recreate on a day-to-day basis."&lt;ref name=roof&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roof|first=K|author2=Oleru N.|title=Public Health: Seattle and King County's Push for the Built Environment.|journal=J Environ Health|year=2008|volume=75|pages=24–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "built environment encompasses places and spaces created or modified by people including buildings, parks, and transportation systems." In recent years,{{when|date=January 2015}} [[public health]] research has expanded the definition of "built environment" to include [[healthy diet|healthy]] [[food security|food access]], [[community gardening|community garden]]s, [[mental health]],&lt;ref&gt;http://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/44398590/14-IJTPE-Issue26-Vol8-No1-Mar2016-pp81-87.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJ56TQJRTWSMTNPEA&amp;Expires=1483131396&amp;Signature=gIDntD2bsxFSNNgi%2BR2REeETjFc%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DIJTPE_Journal_IMPACT_OF_BUILT_ENVIRONMEN.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Assari, A Birashk, B Nik, M Mousavi Naghdbishi, R|year=2016|title=IMPACT OF BUILT ENVIRONMENT ON MENTAL HEALTH: REVIEW OF TEHRAN CITY IN IRAN|url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/44398590/14-IJTPE-Issue26-Vol8-No1-Mar2016-pp81-87.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJ56TQJRTWSMTNPEA&amp;Expires=1483131396&amp;Signature=gIDntD2bsxFSNNgi%2BR2REeETjFc%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DIJTPE_Journal_IMPACT_OF_BUILT_ENVIRONMEN.pdf|journal=International Journal on Technical and Physical Problems of Engineering|volume=8 |issue=26|pages=81–87|via=IJTPE}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[walkability]]", and "[[bikeability]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lee|first=V|title=Strategies for Enhancing the Built Environment to Support Healthy Eating and Active Living|url=http://www.preventioninstitute.org/component/jlibrary/article/id-60/127.htm|work=Prevention Institute|accessdate=29 April 2012|author2=Mikkelsen, L|author3=Srikantharajah, J|author4=Cohen, L}}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{expand section|date=January 2015}}
Early concepts of built environment date to [[Classical Antiquity]]: [[Hippodamus]] of [[Miletos]], known as the "father of urban planning,"{{by whom|date=January 2015}} developed [[Ancient Greece|Greek cities]] from 498&amp;nbsp;BC to 408&amp;nbsp;BC that created order by using grid plans that mapped the city. These early city plans eventually gave way to the City Beautiful movement in the late&amp;nbsp;1800s and early&amp;nbsp;1900s, inspired by [[Daniel Hudson Burnham]], a reformist for the Progressivism movement who actively promoted "a reform of the landscape in tandem with political change."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The City Beautiful Movement|url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~cap/citybeautiful/city.html |accessdate=26 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effort was in partnership with others who believed that beautifying American cities would improve the moral compass of the cities and encourage the upper class to spend their money in cities. This beautification process included parks and architectural design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Architecture: The City Beautiful Movement|url=http://encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/61.html|accessdate=22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; By mid-century modernist "indifferent" design influenced the character of work and public spaces, followed by what Alexander describes as a late twentieth century "revival of interest relating to the concept of place (including the built environment), and its relevance to mental health and other fields of study."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alexander|first=Donald|date=2008|title=Physical determinism, modernism and mental health|journal=Environments|issue=35 no.3|doi=|pmid=|hdl=10613/2722}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern built environment==
Currently, built environments are typically used to describe the [[interdisciplinary]] field that addresses the design, construction, management, and use of these man-made surroundings as an interrelated whole as well as their relationship to human activities over time (rather than a particular element in isolation or at a single moment in time). The field is generally not regarded as a traditional profession or [[academic discipline]] in its own right, instead drawing upon areas such as [[economics]], law, [[public policy]], public health, [[management]], [[geography]], design, engineering, technology, and [[environmental sustainability]]. Within the field of public health, built environments are referred to as building or renovating areas in an effort to improve the community's well-being through construction of “aesthetically, health improved, and environmentally improved landscapes and living structures”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Built Environment and Health: 11 Profiles of Neighborhood Transformation|url=http://www.preventioninstitute.org/index.php?option=com_jlibrary&amp;view=article&amp;id=114&amp;Itemid=127|accessdate=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example: community forest user group in Nepal is multidimensional institution, which serves goods and services to the communities through natural resource management (see [[Climate change adaptation in Nepal]]).

==Public health==
In public health, built environment refers to physical environments that are designed with health and wellness as integral parts of the communities. Research has indicated that the way neighbourhoods are created can affect both the physical activity and mental health of the communities’ residents.&lt;ref name=renalds&gt;{{cite journal|last=Renalds|first=A|author2=Smith, T|author3=Hale, P|title=A Systematic Review of Built Environment and Health|journal=Family and Community Health|year=2010|volume=33|issue=1|pages=68–78|doi=10.1097/fch.0b013e3181c4e2e5|pmid=20010006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have shown that built environments that were expressly designed to improve physical activity are linked to higher rates of physical activity, which in turn, positively affects health.&lt;ref name=carlson&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carlson|first=C|author2=Aytur, S|author3=Gardner, K|author4=Rogers, S|title=Complexity in Built Environment, Health, and Destination Walking: A Neighborhood-Scale Analysis|journal=J Urban Health|year=2012|volume=89|issue=2|pages=270–84|doi=10.1007/s11524-011-9652-8|pmid=22350512|pmc=3324613}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:WTM3 Gnarly 0028.jpg|thumb|A separated bike lane in New York City.]]
Neighbourhoods with more [[walkability]] had lower rates of [[obesity]] as well as increased physical activity among its residents. They also had lower rates of [[Depression (mood)|depression]], higher [[social capital]], and less [[alcohol abuse]]. Walkability features in these neighbourhoods include safety, [[sidewalk]] construction, as well as destinations in which to walk.&lt;ref name=renalds /&gt; In addition, the perception of a walkable neighbourhood, one that is perceived to have good sidewalks and connectivity, is correlated with higher rates of physical activity.&lt;ref name=carlson /&gt;

Assessments of walkability have been completed through the use of [[GIS]] programs, such as the Street Smart Walk Score. This example of a walkability assessment tool determines distances to grocery stores and other amenities, as well as connectivity and intersection frequency using specific addresses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Walk Score Methodology|url=http://www2.walkscore.com/pdf/WalkScoreMethodology.pdf|accessdate=30 March 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120511085256/http://www2.walkscore.com/pdf/WalkScoreMethodology.pdf|archivedate=11 May 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assessments such as the Street Smart Walk Score can be utilized by city and country planning departments to improve existing walkability of communities. 

To implement walkable neighbourhoods, community members and local leaders should focus on policy development. An effective framework that has been utilized in an abundance of communities is the Complete Streets concept of community planning that has been developed by the National Complete Streets Coalition (NCSC). &lt;ref name="policy"&gt;{{cite web|title=Complete Streets local policy workbook, Smart Growth America| url=https://smartgrowthamerica.org/resources/complete-streets-local-policy-workbook|archivedate=21 Oct 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; NCSC states that the most successful policies are those that reflect input from a broad group of stakeholders, including transportation planners and engineers, elected officials, transit agencies, public health departments, and members of the community. &lt;ref name="policy"/&gt; According to Riggs, 2016, policies may focus on a “Complete Streets” investment, which includes sidewalk bulb-outs and refuges to reduce crossing distances or street widths for pedestrians. Other investments should include installing crosswalks, road markings, benches, shelters and sidewalk art installations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Riggs|first1=William|title=Inclusively walkable: exploring the equity of walkable housing in the San Francisco Bay Area|journal=Local Environment|volume=21|issue=5|pages=527–554|doi= 10.1080/13549839.2014.982080|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every community will have a unique method of policy development depending on whether it is an urban, suburban, or rural community and how the policy will combine the variety of transportation modalities. Communities may choose to focus on walkability, but will also need to consider biking, wheeling/rolling, driving, and emergency vehicles. The NCSC policy workbook gives descriptive guidance on how to proceed with policy development whether they be council-driven, council-approved, directives, or citizen vote. &lt;ref name="policy"/&gt; When deciding how to proceed with walkability policy development, considerations should be made regarding current and past transportation policies, local community and government support, and how transportation policies have been implemented in the past. 

[[File:Community garden.jpg|thumb|A [[community garden]] located in Montreal, Canada.]]
Public health also addresses additional components of built environments including “[[bikeability]]” and healthy food access such as proximity to grocery stores and [[community garden]]s. Bikeability refers to the access that an area has granted to safe biking through multiple bike paths and [[bike lane]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Horacek|first=TM|author2=White AA|author3=Greene GW|title=Sneakers and spokes: an assessment of the walkability and bikeability of U.S. postsecondary institutions|journal=J Environ Health|year=2012|volume=74|issue=2|pages=8–15|display-authors=etal|pmid=21949979}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both walkability and bikeability have been cited as determinants of physical activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cochrane|first=T|author2=Davey, R|title=Increasing uptake of physical activity: A social ecological approach|journal=J R Soc Promot Health|year=2008|volume=128|issue=1|pages=31–40|pmid=18274328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Access to healthy food is also an important component of the built environment. A higher density of convenience stores has been associated with obesity in children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grafova|first=I|title=Overweight Children: Assessing The Contribution Of The Built Environment.|journal=Prev Med|year=2008|volume=47|issue=3|pages=304–308|doi=10.1016/j.ypmed.2008.04.012|pmid=18539318}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, improved access to community supermarkets and farmer's markets is correlated with lower overweight status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rahman|first=T|author2=Cushing RA|author3=Jackson RJ|title=Contributions of built environment to childhood obesity|journal=Mt Sinai J Med|year=2011|volume=78|issue=1|pages=49–57|doi=10.1002/msj.20235|pmid=21259262}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically in low income neighbourhoods, the presence of a local grocery store is correlated with lower BMI/overweight risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zick|first=C|author2=Smith, K|author3=Fan, J|author4=Brown, B|author5=Yamada, I|author6=Kowaleski-Jones, L|title=Running to the store?

The intersection of public health with other disciplines is evident in the design process of built environments which includes [[environmental planning]], [[policy development]] and [[land-use planning]].&lt;ref name=roof /&gt; Research suggests that people are more active in [[Mixed-use development|mixed-use communities]] or those that incorporate retail and residential and densely populated areas as well as those with good street connectivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Heath|first=G|author2=Brownson, R|author3=Kruger, J|title=The effectiveness of urban design and land use and transport policies and practices to increase physical activity: a systematic review|journal=J Phys Act Health|year=2006|volume=3|issue=s1|pages=S55–S76|display-authors=etal|pmid=28834525|doi=10.1123/jpah.3.s1.s55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who preferred to walk and live in walkable environments often have lower obesity rates and drive less compared to those who preferred living in auto-dependent environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frank|first=L|author2=Saelens, B|author3=Powell, K|author4=Chapmen, J|title=Stepping towards causation: Do built environments or neighborhood and travel preferences explain physical activity, driving, and obesity?|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|year=2007|volume=65|issue=9|pages=1898–1914|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2007.05.053 |pmid=17644231}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Built environments containing recreational facilities have been associated with greater physical activity among children.&lt;ref name="Sallis"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sallis |first1=James F. |last2=Floyd |first2=Myron F. |last3=Rodriguez |first3=Daniel A. |last4=Saelens |first4=Brian E. |title=The Role of Built Environments in Physical Activity, Obesity, and CVD |journal=Circulation |date=February 2012 |volume=125 |issue=5 |pages=729–37 |doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.969022 |pmid=22311885 |pmc=3315587 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one study found that walking paths, parks with playgrounds, swimming areas, basketball courts and other various recreational facilities increased physical activity among adolescent girls. &lt;ref name="cohen"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cohen |first1=Deborah A. |last2=Ashwood |first2=Scott |last3=Scott |first3=Molly M. |last4=Overton |first4=Adrian |last5=Evenson |first5=Kelly R. |last6=Staten |first6=Lisa K. |last7=Porter |first7=Dwayne |last8=McKenzie |first8=Thomas L. |last9=Catellier |first9=Diane |title=Public Parks and Physical Activity Among Adolescent Girls |journal=Pediatrics |date=November 2006 |volume=118 |issue=5 |pages=e1381–9 |pmid=17079539 |pmc=2239262 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/118/5/e1381.long?sso=1&amp;sso_redirect_count=1&amp;nfstatus=401&amp;nftoken=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000&amp;nfstatusdescription=ERROR%3a+No+local+token |accessdate=October 29, 2018|doi=10.1542/peds.2006-1226 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Urban planning and its utilization of mixed use development are key factors affecting childhood obesity. Mixed use spaces are composed of residential, commercial, cultural, and institutional components. &lt;ref name="apa"&gt;{{cite web |title=Planning and Community Health Research Center: Mixed Use Development |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130207034351/https://www.planning.org/nationalcenters/health/mixedusedevelopment.htm |website=American Planning Association |accessdate=October 29, 2018|date=2013-02-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of development helps to reduce the distance residents have to travel to access a grocery store or school. It also creates a more walkable and bike friendly environment for residents. It has been proven that high-density environments, meaning mixed use spaces and neighborhoods with higher walkability and bikeability, will increase physical activity. &lt;ref name="duncan2" /&gt; A multivariable cross-sectional study done by the Harvard School of Public Health examined the association of walkable built environment characteristics with body mass index (BMI) scores among a large sample of children and adolescents. &lt;ref name="duncan2"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Duncan |first1=Dustin T. |last2=Sharifi |first2=Mona |last3=Melly |first3=Steven J. |last4=Marshall |first4=Richard |last5=Sequist |first5=Thomas D. |last6=Rifas-Shiman |first6=Sheryl L. |last7=Taveras |first7=Elsie M. |title=Characteristics of walkable built environments and BMI z-scores in children: evidence from a large electronic health record database |journal=Environmental Health Perspectives |date=December 2014 |volume=122 |issue=12 |pages=1359–65 |doi=10.1289/ehp.1307704|pmid=25248212 |pmc=4256697 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eight geographic information system variables were used to characterize a walkable built environment. (1) A distance less than 15 km to a private or public recreational open space has been linked to an increase in physical activity among children. &lt;ref name="duncan2" /&gt;This may be due to the influence children have on one another when they see others playing.&lt;ref name="duncan2" /&gt; (2) Also, a higher number of open spaces increases the likelihood of physical activity among children. &lt;ref name="duncan2" /&gt; (3) A more densely populated residential area can increase children’s proximity to their peers creating a more walkable environment. &lt;ref name="duncan2" /&gt; (4) Less traffic density can also increase physical activity among children because their parents feel safe when they are walking in the neighborhood.&lt;ref name="duncan2" /&gt; (5-7) Lower neighborhood speed limits with more sidewalks and intersections also create a safer environment for children increasing their likelihood to walk in the neighborhood. &lt;ref name="duncan2" /&gt; (8) Finally, a greater variety of land use mix, or mixed use spaces, result in more children walking. &lt;ref name="duncan2" /&gt; These built environment characteristics that can increase walkability were found to be generally associated with a lower BMI scores among the children sampled. &lt;ref name="duncan2" /&gt; Another study looking at active commuting, those reporting walking, biking, or skateboarding to school more than three times a week, among elementary aged children had significantly lower BMI than non-active commuters. &lt;ref name="Rosenberg"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rosenberg |first1=Dori E. |last2=Sallis |first2=James F. |last3=Conway |first3=Terry L. |last4=Cain |first4=Kelli L. |last5=McKenzie |first5=Thomas L. |title=Active Transportation to School Over 2 Years in Relation to Weight Status and Physical Activity |journal=Obesity |volume=14 |issue=10 |pages=1771–6 |date=September 2012 |doi=10.1038/oby.2006.204 |pmid=17062807 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For these reason, mixed use lands within the built environment are imperative to helping address childhood obesity. Urban sprawl, which has been positively associated with increased obesity, and an overall decline in active transportation in recent decades presents a real need for improving health within the built environment. &lt;ref name="Rosenberg" /&gt; &lt;ref name="Lopez"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lopez |first1=Russ |title=Urban Sprawl and Risk for Being Overweight or Obese |journal=Am J Public Health |date=September 2004 |volume=94 |issue=9 |pages=1574–9 |pmid=15333317 |pmc=1448496 }}&lt;/ref&gt; High-density environments bring schools, parks, and grocery stores closer to residents making it convenient to potentially eat healthier foods and exercise on a regular basis. Comprehensive urban planning, such as mixed use development, promotes healthier lifestyles in general. 

The strength of the evidence for reducing obesity through environment has been highlighted by the [[Center for Disease Control]] in its Common Community Measures for Obesity Prevention Project, which includes measures of healthy food access and physical activity environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kahn|first=LK|author2=Sobush K|author3=Keener D|title=Recommended community strategies and measurements to prevention obesity in the United States|journal=MMWR Recomm Rep|year=2009|volume=58|issue=RR-7|pages=1–26|display-authors=etal|pmid=19629029}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Landscape architecture==
In [[landscape architecture]], the built environment is understood to mean a human-made landscape, as distinguished from the [[natural environment]]; for example, a [[city park]] is a built environment.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

The '''''CORPS''''' game system, or '''''Complete Omniversal Role Playing System''''', is a [[generic role-playing game system]]. It was created by [[Greg Porter (game designer)|Greg Porter]] in 1990.

When the game was first published, it was available in game stores and conventions. Beginning in 2003, [[Blacksburg Tactical Research Center]] ended publication of CORPS books and related materials. They are available only in a [[PDF]] format download, or printed [[Print on demand|on demand]].

== History ==
In 1987, [[Blacksburg Tactical Research Center|Blacksburg Tactical Research Center ("BTRC")]] published its first game, ''[[Timelords (role-playing game)|Timelords]]'', in which players played characters based upon themselves in a time travel setting.  As a time travel/science fiction based game crossing many possible settings, much of the groundwork was already laid for converting the base system into a truly universal RPG, and in fact some players were already using it as a generic game system.  The CORPS system is loosely based on the ''Timelords'' system, but dropping detailed realism in exchange for speed and playability.

The ''CORPS'' game book was first published in 1990 in a small (by comparison to other RPGs) print run and limited marketing.  This was standard business practice for BTRC, which has tried to never go into excessive debt to introduce a product.  The system was initially criticized for not being a truly universal RPG, focusing only on human centered settings. BTRC attempted to learn from this criticism and make changes in the design of its 2nd edition, published in 1995, and later in its next universal system, ''[[EABA]]''.

In August 2008, [[Applied Vectors]] entered into a new contract to create the CORPS Rules Expansion, which included a host of addons for the original game, including a bestiary and reprinted material from the original first edition game. Although this was a new contract, it followed an unrealised earlier contract entered into some time before. This was made available in April 2009.

In September 2011 [[Applied Vectors]] announced a license agreement with BTRC to produce the 3rd edition of the CORPS roleplaying game. This was intended to be a complete overhaul of the system, but as of March 31, 2018 no product other than the CORPS Rules Expansion has appeared and the company seems to be concentrating its efforts on other game systems.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.drivethrurpg.com/browse/pub/556/Applied-Vectors&lt;/ref&gt;

==System==
''CORPS'' uses a custom d10 based system for most actions.

===Characters===
A character in ''CORPS'' is built based on two types of [[statistic (role-playing games)|statistic]] based on '''Attributes''' and '''Skills'''. These are purchased in a points based system, using Attribute Points (AP) to purchase attributes, and Skill Points (SP) to purchase skills.  The total number of points available to spend depends on the setting and Game Master.  A "normal" human might start with 100AP and 50SP, while a superhero character might start with 200AP and SP (or more).

===Attributes===
Attributes are ranked on a 1-10 scale, with an average human rating a 4-5 in any one attribute and 10 being human maximum. ''CORPS'' uses six basic Attributes: '''Strength''', '''Agility''', '''Awareness''', '''Willpower''', '''Health''' and '''Power'''.

The cost of an Attribute is the square of the Attribute rank purchased, so a Strength of 4 would cost 16AP, and an Agility of 5 would cost 25AP.

===Skills===
Skills are linked to attribute scores via aptitudes (attribute/4) and applied to a specific area. Certain skill level requires Skill Points equal to square of the desired skill level minus the square of the related aptitude. Hence character with a high attribute would have to spend less Skill Points to develop skills related to that attribute.

Skills are further broken down into '''Primary''', '''Secondary'''  and '''Tertiary''' skills.  These break down specializations of specific skills. Secondary skills have a maximum level of one-half of the associated Primary skill, and Tertiary skills have a maximum level of one-half of the associated Secondary skill. The aptitude savings apply only to primary skills.

For example, the character with the ''Firearms'' skill of 4 may decide to also purchase the associated Secondary skill of ''Longarms'' with a maximum of 2, and the Tertiary skill of ''M-16A2'' with a maximum of 1.  This character could then use an M-16A2 rifle with a total skill of 7.

===Ads and disads===
Players can also use the points for additional advantages or gain more points by accepting disadvantages. These are very generic like Age, Authority/Duty, Natural Aptitude/Debility, Physical Advantage/Limitation, Psychological Limitation and Wealth (positive or negative). The system also gives some points for writing a character background and drawing a character portrait.

===Success Rolls===
To keep the system simple and fast moving, success rolls are not needed for many actions.  Any action a character may attempt is rated based on difficulty.  If the character's appropriate skill level is equal to or higher than the difficulty, the action succeeds automatically. If it is lower, the player may roll 1d10. If they roll less than 11 minus the difference between their skill and the difficulty of the action times 2, they succeed.  

For example, the character above with a total skill of 7 attempts an action with a difficulty of 8. It is higher than his skill, so it's not automatic. The difference is only 1, so he needs to roll a 9 or less. (11 - (2x1) = '''9'''). If the action had a difficulty of 9, he would need to roll a 7 or less.

While it may seem confusing at first, this system makes success rolls very quick and predictable. The only rolls ever needed are 9, 7, 5, 3, or 1. Any action with a difficulty more than 5 points higher than a character's skill is therefore impossible unless the campaign uses the "long shot" rule; if the player rolls 1, they may roll again with a -5 difficulty.

===Advancement===
Characters advance by increasing their skills and attributes. During play, characters earn additional Attribute and Skills Points related to the attributed and skills they used in play. The cost to increase a skill or attribute is the difference between the cost of the level they currently have, and the cost of the level they want. Therefore, to improve a Strength score from 5 to 6 would cost 11 points (6² - 5² = '''11'', omitting aptitude savings).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7458">[[File:2 parallel footprints.png|thumb|Individual left and right footprints are chiral '''enantiomorphs''' in a plane because they are mirror images while containing no mirror symmetry individually.]]
In [[geometry]], a figure is '''chiral''' (and said to have '''chirality''') if it is not identical to its [[mirror image]], or, more precisely, if it cannot be mapped to its mirror image by [[Rotation (mathematics)|rotation]]s and [[Translation (geometry)|translation]]s alone. An object that is not chiral is said to be achiral. In 3 dimensions, not all achiral objects have a mirror plane. For example, a 3-dimensional object with [[inversion centre]] as its only nontrivial [[symmetry operation]] is achiral but has no mirror plane.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

A chiral object and its mirror image are said to be '''enantiomorphs'''. The word ''chirality'' is derived from the Greek {{lang|grc|χείρ}} (cheir), the hand, the most familiar chiral object; the word ''enantiomorph'' stems from the Greek {{lang|grc|ἐναντίος}} (enantios) 'opposite' + {{lang|grc|μορφή}} (morphe) 'form'.  A non-chiral figure is called '''achiral''' or '''amphichiral'''.

== Examples==
[[File:3D Cartesian Coodinate Handedness.jpg|thumb|left|Left and [[right-hand rule]]s in three dimensions]]
{| class=wikitable align=right
|+ The [[tetromino]]s S and Z are enantiomorphs in 2-dimensions
![[File:Tetromino S.svg|100px]]&lt;BR&gt;S
![[File:Tetromino Z.svg|94px]]&lt;BR&gt;Z
|}
Some chiral three-dimensional objects, such as the [[helix]], can be assigned a right or left [[handedness]], according to the [[right-hand rule]].

Many other familiar objects exhibit the same chiral symmetry of the human body, such as gloves and shoes. Right shoes differ from left shoes only by being mirror images of each other. In contrast thin gloves may not be considered chiral if you can wear them [[wiktionary:inside out|inside-out]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

The J, L, S and Z-shaped ''[[tetromino]]es'' of the popular video game [[Tetris]] also exhibit chirality, but only in a two-dimensional space. Individually they contain no mirror symmetry in the plane.

==Chirality and symmetry group==
A figure is achiral&lt;!--sic!--&gt; if and only if its [[symmetry group]] contains at least one ''orientation-reversing'' isometry. (In Euclidean geometry any [[isometry]] can be written as &lt;math&gt;v\mapsto Av+b&lt;/math&gt; with an [[orthogonal matrix]] &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and a vector &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;. The [[determinant]] of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is either 1 or &amp;minus;1 then. If it is &amp;minus;1 the isometry is ''[[orientation (mathematics)|orientation]]-reversing'', otherwise it is orientation-preserving.)

See &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Petitjean, M. | title = Chirality in metric spaces. In memoriam Michel Deza | journal = Optimization Letters | year = 2017 | doi = 10.1007/s11590-017-1189-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a full mathematical definition of chirality.

==Chirality in three dimensions==
[[File:Chiralität von Würfeln V.1.svg|thumb|Pair of chiral [[dice]] (enantiomorphs)]]
In three dimensions, every figure that possesses a [[mirror plane of symmetry]] ''S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', an inversion center of symmetry ''S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', or a higher [[improper rotation]] (rotoreflection) ''S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' axis of symmetry&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2. Symmetry operations and symmetry elements|url=http://chemwiki.ucdavis.edu/Theoretical_Chemistry/Symmetry/Symmetry_operations_and_symmetry_elements|website=chemwiki.ucdavis.edu|accessdate=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is achiral. (A ''plane of symmetry'' of a figure &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is a plane &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is invariant under the mapping &lt;math&gt;(x,y,z)\mapsto(x,y,-z)&lt;/math&gt;, when &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is chosen to be the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-&lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;-plane of the coordinate system. A ''center of symmetry'' of a figure &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is a point &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is invariant under the mapping &lt;math&gt;(x,y,z)\mapsto(-x,-y,-z)&lt;/math&gt;, when &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is chosen to be the origin of the coordinate system.) Note, however, that there are achiral figures lacking both plane and center of symmetry. An example is the figure

:&lt;math&gt;F_0=\left\{(1,0,0),(0,1,0),(-1,0,0),(0,-1,0),(2,1,1),(-1,2,-1),(-2,-1,1),(1,-2,-1)\right\}&lt;/math&gt;

which is invariant under the orientation reversing isometry &lt;math&gt;(x,y,z)\mapsto(-y,x,-z)&lt;/math&gt; and thus achiral, but it has neither plane nor center of symmetry. The figure

:&lt;math&gt;F_1=\left\{(1,0,0),(-1,0,0),(0,2,0),(0,-2,0),(1,1,1),(-1,-1,-1)\right\}&lt;/math&gt;

also is achiral as the origin is a center of symmetry, but it lacks a plane of symmetry.

Note also that achiral figures can have a [[Point groups in three dimensions#Center of symmetry|center axis]].

==Chirality in two dimensions==
[[File:Bracelets33.svg|thumb|300px|The colored [[Necklace (combinatorics)|necklace]] in the middle is '''chiral''' in 2-dimensions, the two others are '''achiral'''.&lt;br&gt;This means that as physical necklaces on a table the left and right one could be rotated into their mirror image while remaining on the table. The one in the middle, however, would have to be picked up and turned in three dimensions.]]
In two dimensions, every figure which possesses an [[axis of symmetry]] is achiral, and it can be shown that every ''bounded'' achiral figure must have an axis of symmetry. (An ''axis of symmetry'' of a figure &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is a line &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is invariant under the mapping &lt;math&gt;(x,y)\mapsto(x,-y)&lt;/math&gt;, when &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is chosen to be the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-axis of the coordinate system.) For that reason, a [[triangle]] is achiral if it is [[equilateral triangle|equilateral]] or [[isosceles triangle|isosceles]], and is chiral if it is scalene.

Consider the following pattern:
:[[File:Krok 6.png|320px]]

This figure is chiral, as it is not identical to its mirror image:
:[[File:Krok 6 mirrored.png|320px]]

But if one prolongs the pattern in both directions to infinity, one receives an (unbounded) achiral figure which has no axis of symmetry. Its symmetry group is a [[frieze group]] generated by a single [[glide reflection]].

==Knot theory==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Figure-eight knot (mathematics)]] --&gt;

A [[knot (mathematics)|knot]] is called [[amphichiral knot|achiral]] if it can be continuously deformed into its mirror image, otherwise it is called a [[chiral knot]]. For example, the [[unknot]] and the [[figure-eight knot (mathematics)|figure-eight knot]] are achiral, whereas the [[trefoil knot]] is chiral.

'''Comparative cognition''' is the comparative study of the mechanisms and origins of [[cognition]] in various [[species]], and is sometimes seen as more general than, or similar to, [[comparative psychology]].
From a biological point of view, work is being done on the brains of [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit flies]] that should yield techniques precise enough to allow an understanding of the workings of the human brain on a scale appreciative of individual groups of [[neurons]] rather than the more regional scale previously used. Similarly, gene activity in the human [[brain]] is better understood through examination of the brains of mice by the Seattle-based [[Allen Institute for Brain Science]] (see link below), yielding the freely available [[Allen Brain Atlas]]. This type of study is related to comparative cognition, but better classified as one of [[comparative genomics]]. Increasing emphasis in [[psychology]] and [[ethology]] on the biological aspects of [[perception]] and [[behavior]] is bridging the gap between [[genomics]] and [[behavioral analysis]].

In order for scientists to better understand cognitive function across a broad range of species they can systematically compare cognitive abilities between closely and distantly related species&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=van Horik|first=Jayden|last2=Emery|first2=Nathan J.|date=2011-11-01|title=Evolution of cognition|journal=Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Cognitive Science|language=en|volume=2|issue=6|pages=621–633|doi=10.1002/wcs.144|pmid=26302412|issn=1939-5086}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through this process they can determine what kinds of selection pressure has led to different cognitive abilities across a broad range of animals. For example, it has been hypothesized that there is convergent evolution of the higher cognitive functions of corvids and apes, possibly due to both being omnivorous, visual animals that live in social groups.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5084">In [[mathematics]], a '''composition ring''', introduced in {{harv|Adler|1962}}, is a [[commutative ring]] (''R'', 0,  +, &amp;minus;, ·), possibly without an identity 1 (see [[non-unital ring]]), together with an operation

: &lt;math&gt;\circ: R \times R \rightarrow R&lt;/math&gt;

such that, for any three elements &lt;math&gt;f,g,h\in R&lt;/math&gt; one has

# &lt;math&gt;(f+g)\circ h=(f\circ h)+(g\circ h)&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;(f\cdot g)\circ h = (f\circ h)\cdot (g\circ h)&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;(f\circ g)\circ h = f\circ  (g\circ h).&lt;/math&gt;

It is ''not'' generally the case that &lt;math&gt;f\circ g=g\circ f&lt;/math&gt;, ''nor'' is it generally the case that &lt;math&gt;f\circ (g+h)&lt;/math&gt; (or &lt;math&gt;f\circ (g\cdot h)&lt;/math&gt;) has any algebraic relationship to &lt;math&gt;f\circ g&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f\circ h&lt;/math&gt;.

==Examples==

There are a few ways to make a commutative ring ''R'' into a composition ring without introducing anything new.
*Composition may be defined by &lt;math&gt;f\circ g=0&lt;/math&gt; for all ''f'',''g''. The resulting composition ring is a rather uninteresting.
*Composition may be defined by &lt;math&gt;f\circ g=f&lt;/math&gt; for all ''f'',''g''. This is the composition rule for constant functions.
*If ''R'' is a [[boolean ring]], then multiplication may double as composition: &lt;math&gt;f\circ g=fg&lt;/math&gt; for all ''f'',''g''.
More interesting examples can be formed by defining a composition on another ring constructed from ''R''.
*The polynomial ring ''R''[''X''] is a composition ring where &lt;math&gt;(f\circ g) (x)=f(g(x))&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;f, g \in R&lt;/math&gt;.
*The formal power series ring ''R''{{brackets|''X''}} also has a substitution operation, but it is only defined if the series ''g'' being substituted has zero constant term (if not, the constant term of the result would be given by an infinite series with arbitrary coefficients). Therefore, the subset of ''R''{{brackets|''X''}} formed by power series with zero constant coefficient can be made into a composition ring with composition given by the same substitution rule as for polynomials. Since nonzero constant series are absent, this composition ring does not have a multiplicative unit.
*If ''R'' is an integral domain, the field ''R''(''X'') of rational functions also has a substitution operation derived from that of polynomials: substituting a fraction ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for ''X'' into a polynomial of degree ''n'' gives a rational function with denominator &lt;math&gt;g_2^n&lt;/math&gt;, and substituting into a fraction is given by
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{f_1}{f_2}\circ g=\frac{f_1\circ g}{f_2\circ g}.&lt;/math&gt;
:However, as for formal power series, the composition cannot always be defined when the right operand ''g'' is a constant: in the formula given the denominator &lt;math&gt;f_2\circ g&lt;/math&gt; should not be identically zero. One must therefore restrict to a subring of ''R''(''X'') to have a well-defined composition operation; a suitable subring is given by the rational functions of which the numerator has zero constant term, but the denominator has nonzero constant term. Again this composition ring has no multiplicative unit; if ''R'' is a field, it is in fact a subring of the formal power series example.
*The set of all functions from ''R'' to ''R'' under pointwise addition and multiplication, and with &lt;math&gt;\circ&lt;/math&gt; given by composition of functions, is a composition ring. There are numerous variations of this idea, such as the ring of continuous, smooth, holomorphic, or polynomial functions from a ring to itself, when these concepts makes sense.

For a concrete example take the ring &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb Z}[x]&lt;/math&gt;, considered as the ring of polynomial maps from the integers to itself.  A ring endomorphism
: &lt;math&gt;F:{\mathbb Z}[x]\rightarrow{\mathbb Z}[x]&lt;/math&gt;
of &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb Z}[x]&lt;/math&gt; is determined by the image under &lt;math&gt; F&lt;/math&gt; of the variable &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, which we denote by
: &lt;math&gt;f=F(x)&lt;/math&gt;
and this image &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; can be any element of &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb Z}[x]&lt;/math&gt;.    Therefore, one may consider the elements &lt;math&gt;f\in{\mathbb Z}[x]&lt;/math&gt; as endomorphisms and assign &lt;math&gt;\circ:{\mathbb Z}[x]\times{\mathbb Z}[x]\rightarrow{\mathbb Z}[x]&lt;/math&gt;, accordingly.  One easily verifies that &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb Z}[x]&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the above axioms.  &lt;!-- Is &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb Z}[x]&lt;/math&gt;  the free composition ring on one generator?--&gt; For example, one has
: &lt;math&gt;(x^2+3x+5)\circ(x-2)=(x-2)^2+3(x-2)+5=x^2-x+3.&lt;/math&gt;
This example is isomorphic to the given example for ''R''[''X''] with ''R'' equal to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb Z&lt;/math&gt;, and also to the subring of all functions &lt;math&gt;\mathbb Z\to\mathbb Z&lt;/math&gt; formed by the polynomial functions.

'''Cultural imperialism''' comprises the [[Culture|cultural]] aspects of [[imperialism]]. Imperialism here refers to the creation and maintenance of unequal relationships between [[civilization]]s, favoring the more powerful civilization. Thus, cultural imperialism is the practice of promoting and imposing a culture, usually that of a politically powerful [[nation]], over a less powerful society; in other words, the [[cultural hegemony]] of [[Industrialisation|industrialized]] or [[Developed country|economically influential countries]] which determine general cultural values and standardize civilizations throughout the world. The term is employed especially in the fields of history, [[cultural studies]], and [[postcolonial theory]]. It is usually used in a pejorative sense, often in conjunction with calls to reject such influence. Cultural imperialism can take various forms, such as an attitude, a formal policy, or military action, insofar as it reinforces cultural hegemony.

==Background and definitions==
Although the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' has a 1921 reference to the "cultural imperialism of the Russians",&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'', within "cultural"&lt;/ref&gt; John Tomlinson, in his book on the subject, writes that the term emerged in the 1960s&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=0CFMS0z5-gcC&amp;dq=cultural+imperialism&amp;q=%221960s+and+has%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%221960s%20and%20has%22&amp;f=false Tomlinson (1991)], p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; and has been a focus of research since at least the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Hamm, (2005), p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Terms such as "[[media imperialism]]", "structural imperialism", "cultural dependency and domination",  "cultural synchronization", "[[electronic colonialism]]", "ideological imperialism", and "[[economic imperialism]]" have all been used to describe the same basic notion of cultural imperialism.&lt;ref name="White"/&gt;

Various academics give various definitions of the term. American [[media critic]] [[Herbert Schiller]] wrote: "The concept of cultural imperialism today [1975] best describes the sum of the processes by which a society is brought into the modern world system and how its dominating stratum is attracted, pressured, forced, and sometimes bribed into shaping social institutions to correspond to, or even promote, the values and structures of the dominating centre of the system. The public media are the foremost example of operating enterprises that are used in the penetrative process. For penetration on a significant scale the media themselves must be captured by the dominating/penetrating power. This occurs largely through the commercialization of broadcasting."&lt;ref name="Schiller 76"&gt;{{cite book|last=Schiller|first=Herbert I.|title=Communication and cultural domination|publisher=International Arts and Sciences Press, 901 North Broadway, White Plains, New York 10603 |year=1976|pages=9–10|isbn=978-0-87332-079-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tom McPhail]] defined "Electronic colonialism as the dependency relationship established by the importation of communication hardware, foreign-produced software, along with engineers, technicians, and related information protocols, that vicariously establish a set of foreign norms, values, and expectations which, in varying degrees, may alter the domestic cultures and socialization processes."&lt;ref name="McPhail"&gt;{{cite book|last=McPhail|first=Thomas L.|title=Electronic colonialism: the future of international broadcasting and communication|publisher=Sage Publications|year=1987|series=Volume 126 of Sage library of social research|page=18|isbn=978-0-8039-2730-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sui-Nam Lee observed that "communication imperialism can be defined as the process in which the ownership and control over the hardware and software of mass media as well as other major forms of communication in one country are singly or together subjugated to the domination of another country with deleterious effects on the indigenous values, norms and culture."&lt;ref name="Lee"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lee |first=Siu-Nam Lee |year=1988|title=Communication imperialism and dependency: A conceptual clarification|journal=International Communication Gazette|publisher=Kiuwer Academic Publishers|location=Netherlands|issue= 41|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ogan saw "media imperialism often described as a process whereby the United States and Western Europe produce most of the media products, make the first profits from domestic sales, and then market the products in Third World countries at costs considerably lower than those the countries would have to bear to produce similar products at home."&lt;ref name="Ogan"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ogan|first=Christine|date=Spring 1988|title=Media Imperialism and the Videocassette Recorder: The Case of Turkey|journal=Journal of Communication|volume= 38|issue= 2|page=94|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.1988.tb02049.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Downing and Sreberny-Mohammadi state: "Imperialism is the conquest and control of one country by a more powerful one. Cultural imperialism signifies the dimensions of the process that go beyond economic exploitation or military force. In the history of [[colonialism]], (i.e., the form of imperialism in which the government of the colony is run directly by foreigners), the educational and media systems of many Third World countries have been set up as replicas of those in Britain, France, or the United States and carry their values. Western advertising has made further inroads, as have architectural and fashion styles. Subtly but powerfully, the message has often been insinuated that Western cultures are superior to the cultures of the Third World."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Downing,|first=John|author2=Ali Mohammadi |author3=Annabelle Sreberny-Mohammadi |title=Questioning the media: a critical introduction|publisher=SAGE|year=1995|edition=2, illustrated|page=482|isbn=978-0-8039-7197-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Needless to say, all these authors agree that cultural imperialism promotes the interests of certain circles within the imperial powers, often to the detriment of the target societies.

The issue of cultural imperialism emerged largely from [[communication studies]].&lt;ref name="Salwen"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Salwen |first=Michael B. |title=Cultural imperialism: A media effects approach  |date=March 1991|journal=Critical Studies in Media Communication|volume= 8|issue= 1 |pages=29–38 |doi=10.1080/15295039109366778}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, cultural imperialism has been used as a framework by scholars to explain phenomena in the areas of [[international relations]], [[anthropology]], education, science, history, literature, and sports.&lt;ref name="White" /&gt;

==Theoretical foundations==
Many of today's academics that employ the term, ''cultural imperialism,'' are heavily informed by the work of [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]], [[Jacques Derrida|Derrida]], [[Edward Said|Said]], and other [[Post-structuralism|poststructuralist]] and postcolonialist theorists.&lt;ref name=White&gt;White, Livingston A. "Reconsidering Cultural Imperialism Theory" ''Transnational Broadcasting Studies'' no.6 Spring/Summer 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Within the realm of postcolonial discourse, ''cultural imperialism'' can be seen as the cultural legacy of colonialism, or forms of social action contributing to the continuation of Western [[hegemony]]. To some outside of the realm of this discourse, the term is critiqued as being unclear, unfocused, and/or contradictory in nature.&lt;ref name="White" /&gt;

===Michel Foucault===
The work of French philosopher and [[social theorist]] [[Michel Foucault]] has heavily influenced use of the term ''cultural imperialism,'' particularly his philosophical interpretation of [[Power (philosophy)|power]] and his concept of [[governmentality]].

Following an interpretation of power similar to that of [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavelli]], Foucault defines power as immaterial, as a "certain type of relation between individuals" that has to do with complex strategic social positions that relate to the subject's ability to control its environment and influence those around itself.&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, Michel. 1979. "''Omnes et Singulatim'': Towards a Criticism of Political Reason" in Faubion, James D. (ed.) ''Essential Works of Foucault, Volume 3: Power'' New York: The New Press&lt;/ref&gt; According to Foucault, power is intimately tied with his conception of [[truth]]. "Truth", as he defines it, is a "system of ordered procedures for the production, regulation, distribution, circulation, and operation of statements" which has a "circular relation" with systems of power.&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, Michel. 1979. "Truth and Power" in Faubion, James D. (ed.) ''Essential Works of Foucault, Volume 3: Power'' New York: The New Press&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, inherent in systems of power, is always "truth", which is culturally specific, inseparable from [[ideology]] which often coincides with various forms of [[hegemony]]. ''Cultural imperialism'' may be an example of this.

Foucault's interpretation of governance is also very important in constructing theories of transnational power structure.  In his lectures at the [[Collège de France]], Foucault often defines governmentality as the broad art of "governing", which goes beyond the traditional conception of governance in terms of state mandates, and into other realms such as governing "a household, souls, children, a province, a convent, a religious order, a family".&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, Michel. 1978. "Governmentality" in  Faubion, James D. (ed.) ''Essential Works of Foucault, Volume 3: Power'' New York: The New Press&lt;/ref&gt; This relates directly back to Machiavelli's [[The Prince]], and Foucault's aforementioned conceptions of [[truth]] and [[Power (philosophy)|power]]. (i.e. various [[Subjectivity|subjectivities]] are created through power relations that are culturally specific, which lead to various forms of culturally specific governmentality such as [[neoliberal]] governmentality.)

===Edward Saïd===
Informed by the works of [[Noam Chomsky]], Foucault, and [[Antonio Gramsci]], Edward Saïd is a founding figure of postcolonialism, established with the book ''[[Orientalism (book)|Orientalism]]'' (1978), a [[Humanism|humanist]] critique of [[Age of Enlightenment|The Enlightenment]], which criticizes Western knowledge of "The East"—specifically the English and the French [[Social construct|constructions]] of what is and what is not "Oriental".&lt;ref&gt;Robert Young, ''White Mythologies: Writing History and the West'', New York &amp; London: Routledge, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.counterpunch.org/said08052003.html Orientalism 25 Years Later, by Said in 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Orientalism"&gt;Saïd, Edward. 1978. ''Orientalism.'' New York: Pantheon Books&lt;/ref&gt; Whereby said "knowledge" then led to cultural tendencies towards a [[binary opposition]] of the Orient vs. the Occident, wherein one concept is defined in opposition to the other concept, and from which they emerge as of unequal value.&lt;ref name="Orientalism" /&gt; In ''[[Culture and Imperialism]]'' (1993), the sequel to ''Orientalism'', Saïd proposes that, despite the formal end of the “age of empire” after the [[World War II|Second World War]] (1939–45), colonial imperialism left a cultural legacy to the (previously) colonized peoples, which remains in their contemporary civilizations; and that said ''cultural imperialism'' is very influential in the international systems of [[Power (social and political)|power]].&lt;ref&gt;Saïd, Edward. 1993. ''[[Culture and Imperialism]]'' New York: Pantheon Books&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak===

A self-described "practical Marxist-feminist-deconstructionist"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=LAHIRI|first=BULAN|title=Speaking to Spivak|url=http://www.hindu.com/lr/2011/02/06/stories/2011020650020100.htm|accessdate=9 December 2011|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|date=2011-02-06|location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak]] has published a number of works challenging the "legacy of colonialism" including ''A Critique of Postcolonial Reason: Towards a History of the Vanishing Present'' (1999), ''Other Asias'' (2005), and "Can the Subaltern Speak?" (1988).&lt;ref name=speak&gt;[http://www.maldura.unipd.it/dllags/docentianglo/materiali_oboe_lm/2581_001.pdf  Spivak, Gayatri Chakravorty. 1988. "Can the Subaltern Speak"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105154619/http://www.maldura.unipd.it/dllags/docentianglo/materiali_oboe_lm/2581_001.pdf |date=5 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "Can the Subaltern Speak?" Spivak critiques common representations in the West of the [[Sati (practice)|Sati]], as being controlled by authors other than the participants (specifically English colonizers and Hindu leaders). Because of this, Spivak argues that the [[subaltern (postcolonialism)|subaltern]], referring to the communities that participate in the Sati, are not able to represent themselves through their own voice. Spivak says that cultural imperialism has the power to disqualify or erase the knowledge and mode of education of certain populations that are low on the social hierarchy.&lt;ref name=speak /&gt;

Throughout "Can the Subaltern Speak?", Spivak cites the works of Karl Marx, Michel Foucault, Walter Benjamin, Louis Althusser, Jacques Derrida, and Edward Said, among others.

In ''A critique of Postcolonial Reason'', Spivak argues that Western philosophy has a history of not only exclusion of the subaltern from discourse, but also does not allow them to occupy the space of a fully human subject.

==Contemporary ideas and debate==
''Cultural imperialism'' can refer to either the forced acculturation of a subject population, or to the voluntary embracing of a foreign culture by individuals who do so of their own free will.  Since these are two very different referents, the validity of the term has been called into question.

Cultural influence can be seen by the "receiving" culture as either a threat to or an enrichment of its [[cultural identity]]. It seems therefore useful to distinguish between cultural imperialism as an (active or passive) attitude of superiority, and the position of a culture or group that seeks to complement its own cultural production, considered partly deficient, with imported products.

The imported products or services can themselves represent, or be associated with, certain values (such as [[consumerism]]). According to one argument, the "receiving" [[culture]] does not necessarily perceive this link, but instead absorbs the foreign culture passively through the use of the foreign goods and services. Due to its somewhat concealed, but very potent nature, this hypothetical idea is described by some experts as "''banal imperialism''." For example, it is argued that while "American companies are accused of wanting to control 95 percent of the world's consumers", "cultural imperialism involves much more than simple consumer goods; it involved the dissemination of American principles such as freedom and democracy", a process which "may sound appealing" but which "masks a frightening truth: many cultures around the world are disappearing due to the overwhelming influence of corporate and cultural America".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sayre|first=Shay|title=Entertainment and Society: Influences, Impacts, and Innovations |year=2010|publisher=Routledge|location=Oxon, New York|isbn=0-415-99806-9|page=31|edition=2nd|author2=Cynthia King}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some believe that the newly globalised economy of the late 20th and early 21st century has facilitated this process through the use of new information technology.  This kind of cultural imperialism is derived from what is called "[[soft power]]". The theory of electronic colonialism extends the issue to global cultural issues and the impact of major multi-media conglomerates, ranging from [[Viacom]], [[Time-Warner]], [[Disney]], [[News Corp]], to [[Google]] and [[Microsoft]] with the focus on the hegemonic power of these mainly United States-based communication giants.

===Cultural diversity===
One of the reasons often given for opposing any form of cultural imperialism, voluntary or otherwise, is the preservation of [[cultural diversity]], a goal seen by some as analogous to the preservation of [[biodiversity|ecological diversity]].  Proponents of this idea argue either that such diversity is valuable in itself, to preserve human historical heritage and knowledge, or instrumentally valuable because it makes available more ways of solving problems and responding to catastrophes, natural or otherwise.

===Ideas relating to African colonization===
Of all the areas of the world that scholars have claimed to be adversely affected by imperialism, Africa is probably the most notable. In the expansive "age of imperialism" of the nineteenth century, scholars have argued that European colonization in Africa has led to the elimination of many various cultures, worldviews, and [[Epistemology|epistemologies]], particularly through neocolonization of public education.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://getd.libs.uga.edu/pdfs/sabrin_mohammed_201305_phd.pdf|title=EXPLORING THE INTELLECTUAL FOUNDATIONS OF EGYPTIAN NATIONAL EDUCATION|last=Sabrin|first=Mohammed|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Monga, C. 1996.  ''Anthropology of Anger: Civil Society and Democracy in Africa.'' Boulder, CO: Lynne Rienner&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name =wa&gt;wa Thiongo, N. 1986. ''Decolonising the Mind: The Politics of Language in African Literature.'' London: James Curry.&lt;/ref&gt; This, arguably has led to uneven development, and further informal forms of social control having to do with culture and imperialism.&lt;ref name=Abdi&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Abdi | first1 = Ali A | year = 2000 | title = Globalization, Culture, and Development: Perspectives on Africa | url = | journal = Journal of Alternative Perspectives in the Social Sciences | volume = 2 | issue = 1| pages = 1–26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A variety of factors, scholars argue, lead to the elimination of cultures, worldviews, and [[Epistemology|epistemologies]], such as "de-linguicization" (replacing native African languages with European ones), devaluing [[Ontology|ontologies]] that are not explicitly individualistic,&lt;ref name=Abdi /&gt; and at times going as far as to not only define Western culture itself as science, but that non-Western approaches to science, the Arts, indigenous culture, etc. are not even knowledge.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; One scholar, [[Ali A. Abdi]], claims that imperialism inherently "involve[s] extensively interactive regimes and heavy contexts of identity deformation, misrecognition, loss of self-esteem, and  individual and social doubt in self-efficacy."(2000: 12)&lt;ref name=Abdi /&gt; Therefore, all imperialism would always, already be cultural.

===Ties to neoliberalism===
[[Neoliberalism]] is often critiqued by sociologists, anthropologists, and cultural studies scholars as being culturally imperialistic. Critics of neoliberalism, at times, claim that it is the newly predominant form of imperialism.&lt;ref name=Abdi /&gt; Other Scholars, such as Elizabeth Dunn and Julia Elyachar have claimed that [[neoliberalism]] requires and creates its own form of [[governmentality]].&lt;ref name=Dunn&gt;Dunn, Elizabeth C. 2004. ''Privatizing Poland: Baby Food, Big Business, and the Remaking of Labor'' Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Elyachar&gt;Elyachar, Julia. 2005. ''Markets of Dispossession: NGOs, Economic Development, and the State in Cairo'' US: Duke University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

In Dunn's work, ''Privatizing Poland'', she argues that the expansion of the [[multinational corporation]], Gerber, into Poland in the 1990s imposed Western, neoliberal [[governmentality]], [[Ideology|ideologies]], and [[Epistemology|epistemologies]] upon the post-soviet persons hired.&lt;ref name=Dunn /&gt; Cultural conflicts occurred most notably the company's inherent [[Individualism|individualistic]] policies, such as promoting competition among workers rather than cooperation, and in its strong opposition to what the company owners claimed was [[bribery]].&lt;ref name=Dunn /&gt;

In Elyachar's work, ''Markets of Dispossession'', she focuses on ways in which, in [[Cairo]], [[NGO]]s along with [[International nongovernmental organization|INGO]]s and the state promoted neoliberal [[governmentality]] through schemas of economic development that relied upon "youth microentrepreneurs."&lt;ref name=Elyachar /&gt; Youth microentrepreneurs would receive small loans to build their own businesses, similar to the way that [[microfinance]] supposedly operates.&lt;ref name=Elyachar /&gt; Elyachar argues though, that these programs not only were a failure, but that they shifted cultural opinions of [[value (personal and cultural)]] in a way that favored Western ways of thinking and being.&lt;ref name=Elyachar /&gt;

===Ties to development studies===
Often, methods of promoting development and social justice to  are critiqued as being imperialistic, in a cultural sense. For example, Chandra Mohanty has critiqued Western [[feminism]], claiming that it has created a misrepresentation of the "third world woman" as being completely powerless, unable to resist male dominance.&lt;ref name=Mohanty&gt;Mohanty, Chandra. 1988. "Under Western Eyes: Feminist Scholarship and Colonial Discourses" ''Feminist Review'' no. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, this leads to the often critiqued narrative of the "white man" saving the "brown woman" from the "brown man." Other, more radical critiques of [[development studies]], have to do with the field of study itself. Some scholars even question the intentions of those developing the field of study, claiming that efforts to "develop" the [[Global South]] were never about the South itself. Instead, these efforts, it is argued, were made in order to advance Western development and reinforce Western hegemony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dossa | first1 = Shiraz | year = 2007 | title = Slicing Up 'Development': Colonialism, political theory, ethics | url = | journal = Third World Quarterly | volume = 28 | issue = 5| pages = 887–899 | doi=10.1080/01436590701371595}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ties to media effects studies===
The core of cultural imperialism thesis is integrated with the political-economy traditional approach in media effects research. Critics of cultural imperialism commonly claim that non-Western cultures, particularly from the Third World, will forsake their traditional values and lose their cultural identities when they are solely exposed to Western media. Nonetheless, Michael B. Salwen, in his book ''Critical Studies in Mass Communication'' (1991),&lt;ref&gt;Salwen, Michael B. 1991. "Cultural Imperialism: A Media Effects Approach." Critical Studies In Mass Communication 8, no. 1: 29. Communication &amp; Mass Media Complete, EBSCOhost&lt;/ref&gt; claims that cross-consideration and integration of empirical findings on cultural imperialist influences is very critical in terms of understanding mass media in the international sphere. He recognizes both of contradictory contexts on cultural imperialist impacts. 
The first context is where cultural imperialism imposes socio-political disruptions on developing nations. Western media can distort images of foreign cultures and provoke personal and social conflicts to developing nations in some cases.&lt;ref&gt;Tan, A.s., Tan, G. K., &amp; Tan. A.S. (1987), American TV in the Philippines: A test of cultural impact. Journalism Quarterly&lt;/ref&gt; 
Another context is that peoples in developing nations resist to foreign media and preserve their cultural attitudes. Although he admits that outward manifestations of Western culture may be adopted, but the fundamental values and behaviors remain still. Furthermore, positive effects might occur when male-dominated cultures adopt the “liberation” of women with exposure to Western media&lt;ref&gt;Kang, J. G., &amp; Morgan, M. (1988). Culture clash: Impact of U.S. television in Korea. Journalism Quarterly&lt;/ref&gt; and it stimulates ample exchange of cultural exchange.&lt;ref&gt;Sparkes, V. (1977). TV across the Canadian border: Does it matter? Journal of Communication,&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticisms of "cultural imperialism theory"===
Critics of scholars who discuss cultural imperialism have a number of critiques. ''Cultural imperialism'' is a term that is only used in discussions where [[cultural relativism]] and [[Constructivist epistemology|constructivism]] are generally taken as true. (One cannot critique promoting Western values if one believes that said values are absolutely correct. Similarly, one cannot argue that Western epistemology is unjustly promoted in non-Western societies if one believes that those epistemologies are absolutely correct.&lt;ref name="White" /&gt;) Therefore, those who disagree with cultural relativism and/or constructivism may critique the employment of the term, ''cultural imperialism'' on those terms.

John Tomlinson provides a critique of cultural imperialism theory and reveals major problems in the way in which the idea of cultural, as opposed to economic or political, imperialism is formulated. In his book ''Cultural Imperialism: A Critical Introduction'', he delves into the much debated “[[media imperialism]]” theory. Summarizing research on the Third World’s reception of American television shows, he challenges the cultural imperialism argument, conveying his doubts about the degree to which US shows in developing nations actually carry US values and improve the profits of US companies. Tomlinson suggests that cultural imperialism is growing in some respects, but local transformation and interpretations of imported media products propose that cultural diversification is not at an end in global society.&lt;ref&gt;Lechner, Frank J. and Boli, John (2009). ''The Globalization Reader'' (4th ed), Wiley-Blackwell. p.341&lt;/ref&gt; He explains that one of the fundamental conceptual mistakes of cultural imperialism is to take for granted that the distribution of cultural goods can be considered as cultural dominance. He thus supports his argument highly criticizing the concept that [[Americanization]] is occurring through global overflow of American television products. He points to a myriad of examples of television networks who have managed to dominate their domestic markets and that domestic programs generally top the ratings. He also doubts the concept that cultural agents are passive receivers of information. He states that movement between cultural/geographical areas always involves translation, mutation, adaptation, and the creation of hybridity.

Other major critiques are that the term is not defined well, and employs further terms that are not defined well, and therefore lacks explanatory power, that ''cultural imperialism'' is hard to measure, and that the theory of a legacy of [[colonialism]] is not always true.&lt;ref name="White" /&gt;

===Rothkopf on dealing with cultural dominance===
[[David Rothkopf]], managing director of [[Kissinger Associates]] and an adjunct professor of [[international relations|international affairs]] at [[Columbia University]] (who also served as a senior [[US Commerce Department]] official in the [[Clinton Administration]]), wrote about cultural imperialism in his provocatively titled ''In Praise of Cultural Imperialism?'' in the summer 1997 issue of ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' magazine. Rothkopf says that the United States should embrace "cultural imperialism" as in its self-interest. But his definition of cultural imperialism stresses spreading the values of [[Toleration|tolerance]] and openness to cultural change in order to avoid war and conflict between cultures as well as expanding accepted technological and legal standards to provide free traders with enough security to do business with more countries. Rothkopf's definition almost exclusively involves allowing individuals in other nations to accept or reject foreign cultural influences. He also mentions, but only in passing, the use of the [[English language]] and consumption of news and popular music and film as cultural dominance that he supports. Rothkopf additionally makes the point that [[globalization]] and the [[Internet]] are accelerating the process of cultural influence.&lt;ref name=rothkopf&gt;Rothkopf, David, [http://www.globalpolicy.org/globaliz/cultural/globcult.htm "In Praise of Cultural Imperialism"], ''Foreign Affairs'', Summer 1997, Volume 107, pp. 38–53; all descriptions of Rothkopf's points and his quotes are from this article {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081117105019/http://www.globalpolicy.org/globaliz/cultural/globcult.htm |date=17 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Culture is sometimes used by the organizers of society—politicians, theologians, academics, and families—to impose and ensure order, the rudiments of which change over time as need dictates. One need only look at the 20th century's [[genocide]]s. In each one, leaders used culture as a political front to fuel the passions of their armies and other minions and to justify their actions among their people.

Rothkopf then cites genocide and [[Wiktionary:massacre|massacre]]s in [[Armenia]], Russia, the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], [[Cambodia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Rwanda]] and [[East Timor]] as examples of culture (in some cases expressed in the ideology of "political culture" or religion) being misused to justify violence. He also acknowledges that cultural imperialism in the past has been guilty of forcefully eliminating the cultures of natives in the Americas and in Africa, or through use of the [[Inquisition]], ''"and during the expansion of virtually every [[empire]]."''.The most important way to deal with cultural influence in any nation, according to Rothkopf, is to promote tolerance and allow, or even promote, cultural diversities that are compatible with tolerance and to eliminate those cultural differences that cause violent conflict:

:Successful multicultural societies, be they nations, federations, or other conglomerations of closely interrelated states, discern those aspects of culture that do not threaten union, stability, or prosperity (such as food, holidays, rituals, and music) and allow them to flourish. But they counteract or eradicate the more subversive elements of culture (exclusionary aspects of religion, language, and political/ideological beliefs). History shows that bridging cultural gaps successfully and serving as a home to diverse peoples requires certain social structures, laws, and institutions that transcend culture. Furthermore, the history of a number of ongoing experiments in [[multiculturalism]], such as in the European Union, India, South Africa, Canada and the United States, suggests that workable, if not perfected, integrative models exist. Each is built on the idea that tolerance is crucial to social well-being, and each at times has been threatened by both intolerance and a heightened emphasis on cultural distinctions. The greater public good warrants eliminating those cultural characteristics that promote conflict or prevent harmony, even as less-divisive, more personally observed cultural distinctions are celebrated and preserved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = O'Meara | first1 = Patrick. | last2 = Mehlinger | first2 = Howard D. | last3 = Krain | first3 = Matthew. | title = Globalization and the challenges of a new century : a reader | year = 2000 | publisher = Indiana University Press | location = Bloomington, Ind. | isbn = 978-0-253-21355-6 | pages = 445–446 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VLwlnhq01RIC&amp;dq=Globalization+and+the+challenges&amp;q=445+chinese#v=snippet&amp;q=445%20chinese&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural dominance can also be seen in the 1930s in Australia where the Aboriginal Assimilation Policy acted as an attempt to wipe out the Native Australian people. The British settlers tried to biologically alter the skin colour of the Australian Aboriginal people through mixed breeding with white people. The policy also made attempts to forcefully conform the Aborigines to western ideas of dress and education.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Caruso, Australian Feminist Studies, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the term was popularized in the 1960s, and was used by its original proponents to refer to cultural hegemonies in a post-colonial world, cultural imperialism has also been used to refer to times further in the past.

===Ancient Rome===
The [[Roman Empire]] has been seen as an early example of cultural imperialism.

Early Rome, in its conquest of Italy, assimilated the people of [[Etruria]] by replacing the [[Etruscan language]] with Latin, which led to the demise of that language and many aspects of [[Etruscan civilization]].&lt;ref name="books.google.co.uk"&gt;Kolb, RW., [https://books.google.com/books?id=v751AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT607&amp;dq=%22cultural+imperialism%22+rome&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=M-meVaXiFKe27Abz8K7QCA&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22cultural%20imperialism%22%20rome&amp;f=false ''Encyclopedia of Business Ethics and Society''], SAGE Publications, 2007, p. 537.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural [[Romanization (cultural)|Romanization]] was imposed on many parts of Rome's empire by "many regions receiving Roman culture unwillingly, as a form of cultural imperialism."&lt;ref&gt;Ermatinger, JW., [https://books.google.com/books?id=EdBEHD4XQ-0C&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=%22cultural+imperialism%22+rome&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=p-ieVZusJKnD7gbzloLQBQ&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22cultural%20imperialism%22%20rome&amp;f=false ''The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire''], Greenwood Publishing Group, 2004, p.1.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when Greece was conquered by the Roman armies, Rome set about altering the culture of Greece to conform with Roman ideals. For instance, the Greek habit of stripping naked, in public, for exercise, was looked on askance by Roman writers, who considered the practice to be a cause of the Greeks' effeminacy and enslavement.&lt;ref&gt;Goldhill, S., [https://books.google.com/books?id=rbwCTL507fsC&amp;pg=PA21&amp;dq=%22cultural+imperialism%22+rome&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=p-ieVZusJKnD7gbzloLQBQ&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwCA#v=snippet&amp;q=naked%20plutarch%20open%20air&amp;f=false ''Being Greek Under Rome: Cultural Identity, the Second Sophistic and the Development of Empire''], Cambridge University Press, 2006, pp. 2 &amp; 114.&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman example has been linked to modern instances of European imperialism in African countries, bridging the two instances with Slavoj Zizek's discussions of 'empty signifiers'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://getd.libs.uga.edu/pdfs/sabrin_mohammed_201305_phd.pdf|title=EXPLORING THE INTELLECTUAL FOUNDATIONS OF EGYPTIAN NATIONAL EDUCATION|last=Sabrin|first=Mohammed|date=2013|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Pax Romana]] was secured in the empire, in part, by the "forced acculturation of the culturally diverse populations that Rome had conquered."&lt;ref name="books.google.co.uk"/&gt;

===British Empire===
British worldwide expansion in the 18th and 19th centuries was an economic and political phenomenon. However, "there was also a strong social and cultural dimension to it, which [[Rudyard Kipling]] termed the '[[white man's burden]]'." One of the ways this was carried out was by religious proselytising, by, amongst others, the [[London Missionary Society]], which was "an agent of British cultural imperialism."&lt;ref&gt;Olson, JS.; Shadle, R., [https://books.google.com/books?id=f0VnzMelzm8C&amp;pg=PA682&amp;dq=%22cultural+imperialism%22+british+empire+-sport&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5o6fVaTwEump7Ab4r4PoCQ&amp;ved=0CFQQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22cultural%20imperialism%22%20british%20empire%20-sport&amp;f=false ''Historical Dictionary of the British Empire, Volume 2''], Greenwood Publishing Group, 1996, p. 682.&lt;/ref&gt; Another way, was by the imposition of educational material on the colonies for an "imperial curriculum". Morag Bell writes, "The promotion of empire through books, illustrative materials, and educational syllabuses was widespread, part of an education policy geared to cultural imperialism".&lt;ref&gt;Bell, M., [https://books.google.com/books?id=sGa7AAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=%22cultural+imperialism%22+british+empire+-sport&amp;q=%22cultural+imperialism%22+curriculum#v=snippet&amp;q=%22cultural%20imperialism%22%20curriculum&amp;f=false ''Geography and Imperialism, 1820-1940''], Manchester University Press, 1995, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; This was also true of science and technology in the empire. Douglas M. Peers and Nandini Gooptu note that "Most scholars of colonial science in India now prefer to stress the ways in which science and technology worked in the service of colonialism, as both a 'tool of empire' in the practical sense and as a vehicle for cultural imperialism. In other words, science developed in India in ways that reflected colonial priorities, tending to benefit Europeans at the expense of Indians, while remaining dependent on and subservient to scientific authorities in the colonial metropolis."&lt;ref&gt;Peers, DM.; Gooptu, N., [https://books.google.com/books?id=kTYfAQAAQBAJ&amp;dq=%22cultural+imperialism%22+british+empire+-sport&amp;q=%22cultural+imperialism%22+science#v=snippet&amp;q=%22cultural%20imperialism%22%20science&amp;f=false ''India and the British Empire''], OUP Oxford, 2012. p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt;

The analysis of cultural imperialism carried out by Edward Said drew principally from a study of the [[British Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Webster, A., [https://books.google.com/books?id=EbgNECex-mkC&amp;dq=%22cultural+imperialism%22+british+empire+-sport&amp;q=%22cultural+imperialism%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22cultural%20imperialism%22&amp;f=false ''The Debate on the Rise of British Imperialism''], Manchester University Press, 2006, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Danilo Raponi, the cultural imperialism of the British in the 19th century had a much wider effect than only in the British Empire. He writes, "To paraphrase Said, I see cultural imperialism as a complex cultural hegemony of a country, Great Britain, that in the 19th century had no rivals in terms of its ability to project its power across the world and to influence the cultural, political and commercial affairs of most countries. It is the 'cultural hegemony' of a country whose power to export the most fundamental ideas and concepts at the basis of its understanding of 'civilisation' knew practically no bounds." In this, for example, Raponi includes Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Raponi, D., [https://books.google.com/books?id=gw5HBQAAQBAJ&amp;dq=%22cultural+imperialism%22+british+empire+-sport&amp;q=%22cultural+imperialism%22+manifest#v=snippet&amp;q=%22cultural%20imperialism%22%20manifest&amp;f=false ''Religion and Politics in the Risorgimento: Britain and the New Italy, 1861-1875''], Palgrave Macmillan, 2014, pp. 56-58.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other pre-Second World War examples===
The [[New Cambridge Modern History]] writes about the cultural imperialism of [[Napoleonic France]]. Napoleon used the [[Institut de France]] "as an instrument for transmuting French universalism into cultural imperialism." Members of the Institute (who included Napoleon), descended upon Egypt in 1798. "Upon arrival they organised themselves into an Institute of Cairo. The Rosetta Stone is their most famous find. The science of Egyptology is their legacy."&lt;ref&gt;Crawley, CW. (ed.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=mfV7qQ_oiVEC&amp;dq=%22cultural+imperialism%22+nazi+war&amp;q=%22cultural+imperialism%22+egypt+126#v=snippet&amp;q=%22cultural%20imperialism%22%20egypt%20126&amp;f=false ''The New Cambridge Modern History: Volume 9, War and Peace in an Age of Upheaval, 1793-1830'']. Cambridge University Press, 1965, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[First World War]], Germans were worried about the extent of French influence in the annexed [[Rhineland]], with the French [[occupation of the Ruhr]] Valley in 1923. An early use of the term appeared in an essay by Paul Ruhlmann (as "Peter Hartmann") at that date, entitled ''French Cultural Imperialism on the Rhine''.&lt;ref&gt;Poley, J., [https://books.google.com/books?id=q__sRFdeKeIC&amp;dq=%22cultural+imperialism%22+french&amp;q=%22cultural+imperialism%22+french+rhine+1923#v=snippet&amp;q=%22cultural%20imperialism%22%20french%20rhine%201923&amp;f=false ''Decolonisation in Germany: Weimar Narratives of Colonial Loss and Foreign Occupation''], Peter Lang, 2007, pp. 165 &amp; 216.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nazi colonialism===
''Cultural imperialism'' has also been used in connection with the expansion of German influence under the [[Nazis]] in the middle of the twentieth century. Alan Steinweis and Daniel Rogers note that even before the Nazis came to power, "Already in the Weimar Republic, German academic specialists on eastern Europe had contributed through their publications and teaching to the legitimization of German territorial [[revanchism]] and cultural imperialism. These scholars operated primarily in the disciplines Of history, economics, geography, and literature."&lt;ref&gt;Steinweis, AE; Rogers, DE., [https://books.google.com/books?id=RZ7igJKC6YQC&amp;pg=PA72&amp;dq=nazi+%22cultural+imperialism%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwADgKahUKEwj5n8CUo9_GAhUDPhQKHYxuAHk#v=onepage&amp;q=nazi%20%22cultural%20imperialism%22&amp;f=false ''The Impact of Nazism: New Perspectives on the Third Reich and Its Legacy']', U of Nebraska Press, 2003, p.72.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the area of music, Michael Kater writes that during the WWII German occupation of France, [[Hans Rosbaud]], a German conductor based by the Nazi regime in [[Strasbourg]], became "at least nominally, a servant of Nazi cultural imperialism directed against the French."&lt;ref&gt;Kater, MH., [https://books.google.com/books?id=JGSDC5w-pfMC&amp;pg=PA275&amp;dq=nazi+%22cultural+imperialism%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBzgKahUKEwj5n8CUo9_GAhUDPhQKHYxuAHk#v=onepage&amp;q=nazi%20%22cultural%20imperialism%22&amp;f=false ''Composers of the Nazi Era: Eight Portraits''], Oxford University Press, USA, 1999, p.275.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Italy during the war, Germany pursued "a European cultural front that gravitates around German culture". The Nazi propaganda minister [[Joseph Goebbels]] set up the European Union of Writers, "one of Goebbels's most ambitious projects for Nazi cultural hegemony. Presumably a means of gathering authors from Germany, Italy, and the occupied countries to plan the literary life of the new Europe, the union soon emerged as a vehicle of German cultural imperialism."&lt;ref&gt;Ben-Ghiat, R., [https://books.google.com/books?id=MBFe5v2ZTy4C&amp;pg=PA179&amp;dq=nazi+%22cultural+imperialism%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwBWoVChMI6_-fgarfxgIVAVYUCh3gCgAb#v=onepage&amp;q=nazi%20%22cultural%20imperialism%22&amp;f=false ''Fascist Modernities: Italy, 1922-1945''], University of California Press, 2001, p.17.&lt;/ref&gt;

For other parts of Europe, [[Robert Gerwarth]], writing about cultural imperialism and [[Reinhard Heydrich]], states that the "Nazis' Germanization project was based on a historically unprecedented programme of racial stock-taking, theft, expulsion and murder." Also, "The full integration of the [Czech] [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia|Protectorate]] into this New Order required the complete Germanization of the Protectorate's cultural life and the eradication of indigenous Czech and Jewish culture."&lt;ref&gt;Gerwarth, R., [https://books.google.com/books?id=yUz33XJnJOMC&amp;pg=PA268&amp;dq=nazi+%22cultural+imperialism%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAzgoahUKEwjr3IjAsd_GAhVKOhQKHdsQC1E#v=onepage&amp;q=nazi%20%22cultural%20imperialism%22&amp;f=false ''Hitler's Hangman: The Life of Heydrich''], Yale University Press, 2011, p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt;

The actions by [[Nazi Germany]] reflect on the notion of race and culture playing a significant role in imperialism. The idea that there is a distinction between the Germans and the Jews has created the illusion of Germans believing they were superior to the Jewish inferiors, the notion of us/them and self/others.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory, Derek, Johnston, Ron, and Pratt, Geraldine, eds.

'''Demand flow technology''' ('''DFT''') is a strategy for defining and deploying business processes in a flow, driven in response to customer demand.  DFT is based on a set of applied mathematical tools that are used to connect processes in a flow and link it to daily changes in demand.
DFT represents a scientific approach to flow manufacturing for discrete production.  It is built on principles of demand pull where customer demand is the central signal to guide factory and office activity in the daily operation.  DFT is intended to provide an alternative to schedule-push manufacturing which primarily uses a sales plan and forecast to determine a production schedule.

==History==
It was created by John R. Costanza, an executive with operations management experience at [[Hewlett Packard]] and [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]].&lt;ref&gt;Fortune Magazine (2000).  Heroes of U.S. Manufacturing, 20 March 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;  Costanza, who was later nominated as a Nobel Laureate in Economics ( this is not true, he is not on nobel laureat list for economics) for Working Capital Management, founded the John Costanza Institute of Technology in Englewood, CO in 1984 to provide consulting and education services for manufacturers to implement the methodology.

DFT uses applied mathematical methods to link raw and in-process materials with units of time and production resources in order to create a continuous flow in the factory.  The objective is to link factory processes together in a flow and drive it to customer demand instead of to an internal forecast that is inherently inaccurate.

Early adopters of DFT included [[American Standard Companies]]&lt;ref name="E. Kampouris, Long Range Planning pp. 82-95"&gt;"Transforming productivity in multinational manufacture using demand flow technology," with E. Kampouris, Long Range Planning, Vol. 27, no. 6, pp. 82–95, December 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fortune Magazine (1994). PROPHET OF ZERO WORKING CAPITAL. 13 June 1994&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Lawrence Bossidy]]; [[Ram Charan]] (2004) Confronting Reality. p203. {{ISBN|1-4000-5084-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[General Electric]] &lt;ref&gt;[[Lawrence Bossidy]]; [[Ram Charan]] (2002) Execution. p65. {{ISBN|0-609-61057-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and John Deere ([[Deere &amp; Company]]).

In the early years, DFT was regarded as a method for "[[Just in time (business)|just-in-time]]" (JIT), which advocated manufacturing processes driven to actual customer demand via [[Kanban]].  It was introduced as a way for American manufacturers to adopt Japanese production techniques, such as [[Toyota Production System]] (TPS), whilst avoiding some of the cultural conflicts in applying Japanese business methods in an American company.  Later, it has come to be seen as a [[lean manufacturing]] method that allows factories to implement techniques such as one-piece flow, TAKT-based line design, [[Kanban]] material management and demand-driven production.

Demand Flow Technology is promoted as a method particularly suitable for high-mix, low-volume manufacturing.  in 2001, Costanza was awarded a patent for this approach for mixed-model manufacturing.&lt;ref name="Costanza, John R. 1996 pp. 1-352"&gt;Costanza, John R., "The Quantum Leap In Speed To Market", John Costanza Institute of Technology, Inc. (1996). pp. 1–352&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;US Patent 6198980 – System and method for designing a mixed-model manufacturing process, 6 March 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles==

===Demand-driven manufacturing===

The central tenet to DFT is the primacy of customer demand in daily execution of the operation.  According to Aberdeen Group,

:"Demand driven manufacturing involves a synchronized, closed loop between customer orders, production scheduling, and manufacturing execution; all while simultaneously coordinating the flow of materials across the supply chain." [Aberdeen Group, 2007].&lt;ref&gt;"How to achieve best in class demand-driven manufacturing", http://news.thomasnet.com/IMT/archives/2008/01/how_to_achieve_best_in_class_demand_driven_manufacturing.html&lt;/ref&gt;

DFT is a pathway to achieve demand-driven manufacturing capability.  It is used as a framework to guide the design, implementation and deployment of demand driven manufacturing in a repeatable form.  In this way, it is similar original concept of Just-in-Time (JIT) that was first deployed in Japanese manufacturers using a foundation of total quality management.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Walton. (1986). “The Deming Management Method”, page 75, {{ISBN|0-399-55000-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More recently, [[Just in time (business)|Just-in-time]] has been more commonly used to describe supplier delivery methods, rather than a production philosophy.  DFT assumes basic process capability that can arise from TQM and [[statistical process control]] (SPC) principles and embeds it in a framework of management that can more easily achieve demand driven in a repeatable way.

As a result, In-Progress and Finished inventories are all but eliminated, converted permanently into cash at full market value through much faster response to customer orders.

Cash released from Working Capital in this way no longer has to be reinvested in inventory. It becomes available to retire debt, fund growth and innovation.

===Mixed-model production===

[http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/mixed-model-production.html Mixed-model production] is the production of a wide range of product models using a certain degree of shared resources and common material.  It is commonly accepted that modern manufacturing places a greater pressure on producers for more choice in the product offering.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Anderson.  (2006). “The Long Tail: Why the Future of Business is Selling Less of More”. {{ISBN|1-4013-0237-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Products are increasingly assembled from standard components and sub-assemblies, using machines and automated systems as well as manual labour.  DFT is designed to handle this mix and provide a way to establish mixed-model production lines.

A [[production schedule]] based on MRP will tend to cope with high product mix by allocating each model to a multiple of a shift or a day.  This means that the whole product mix is supplied across a scheduling cycle of a multiple of weeks.  This tends to extend the lead-time or increase dependency on the forecast.  DFT offers “The ability to accommodate a range of volumes for any product, any day, based on the direction of actual customer demand”.&lt;ref name="Costanza, John R. 1996 pp. 1-352"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Product synchronization===

The first tool to be used in a DFT implementation, product synchronization is a definition of relationship of processes in a flow to build a product.  It takes the form of a diagram, usually created in pen and paper or whiteboard and formalized with a visualization program such as Microsoft PowerPoint or Visio.  It displays how the processes relate to each other in a flow, with the conversion of raw material to finished goods.  A process is defined by "A logical grouping of value-adding work performed to a common volume".

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Product Synch.JPG]] --&gt;

===Sequence of events (SoE)===

Each of the processes in the product synchronization requires a standard process definition.  In DFT, the sequence of events provides this definition.  In ''The Quantum Leap'', written by Costanza,&lt;ref&gt;John R. Costanza (2005).  The Quantum Leap: Next Generation {{ISBN|1-932159-44-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; the sequence of events is defined as "[t]he definition of the required work and quality criteria to build a product in a specific production process."
The SoE usually takes the form of a table with the product code, process ID, task description and sequence, required work and set-up time for machines and labour, and quality check criteria.  The SoE intends to define times that are reasonable, realistic and repeatable to perform to the necessary quality.  Many of the strengths and criticisms of DFT as a methodology stem from the SoE.  The SoEs are the foundation of process definition but are not used as work instructions.  To communicate standard work at the work center, operation method sheets are used.
In an MRP systems environment, the SoE represents a drill-down from the routing that provides a tabular view of the Product Synchronization at the process level.  A DFT manufacturer would therefore use the SoE as the master record of process definition and derive routings and ISO documentation from it.

===Operation method sheets===

These are visual description of work in motion, materials and the required quality check.  In the purest form, operation method sheets are drawn in [[wire-frame model|wire-frame]] to show the significant contours of the product form and clearly represent work in motion and quality without visual noise.  The OMS has three stages of activity: total quality check, work, and verify.  This establishes the concept where each operator checks the output quality of the operation immediately upstream.  This can contribute to a total quality culture and parts-per-million capability.

===Mixed-model process map===

The sequence of events and product synchronization define how tasks and quality check compose the process for any given product.  The mixed-model process map shows how products and processes form a requirement for resources.  In such a map, the products and processes form a matrix with products as rows and processes as columns.  At the intersection are most commonly actual times (standard times at the process from the sequence of events), but could also display yield and optionality ratios.

===Demand at capacity===

Demand at capacity is the volume of production for a single product item at capacity.  It is a fixed value that defines the maximum daily rate of supply.  The Demand-at-Capacity is often confused with the daily rate of production.  In contrast to [[Toyota Production System]], and many other lean manufacturing derivatives, a DFT line is designed for variable output rates according to daily demand.  Thus, the demand data that are used for line design represent a limit quantity not an actual rate of supply.  The relationship between the Dc and the average daily demand will be driven by the required service level of the product item to market demand.  A higher service level will call for capacity that can supply a higher daily rate than the average over a long range.  This will likely affect the [[resource productivity]] and inventory levels.  A greater mix on the line is able to provide a higher level of service for any given level of resources and inventory.

===Effective hours===

The effective hours is the time available for a given resource to produce product or perform process set-up or changeover.  It is defined per shift and represents the total available time to perform tasks set in the SoE.  Non-productive time such as equipment maintenance, breaks, 5S activity and continuous improvement is deducted from effective hours.  Setup time is included as it is arguably a form of productive time and calculations for batch size optimization and dynamic Kanban will require setup and run-time to be managed from a common pool of resource time.

===Takt &amp; Operational Cycle-Time, OP c/t===

Takt-time is the ratio of time to volume at capacity and in DFT is expressed as

Where HE is Effective Hours, S is the number of shifts and DC is the demand at capacity, a daily rate set for design purposes at some point 2 to 5 years into the future.  This ratio can be expressed for finished products at the end of the line and is referred to as Takt-Time.  It can also apply at the process where bill of material relationships, process yield and optionality can affect the dependent volume for any given Dc at the finished goods level.  At the process level, this ratio is known as operational cycle-time.

Takt time is typically used to calculate the "line design" or number and disposition of physical resources required to produce a given mix and volume of products that changes on a daily basis according to customer demand.

Uniquely to DFT Takt time is constant, based on a fixed mix and product volume which is set for factory design purposes 2 to 5 years into the future. This allows for a stable "line design" that does not need to change on a daily basis. Daily changes in mix and volume are accommodated in DFT by adjusting the number of people working in production. Those not required to meet the Daily Rate (Dr) are free to spend quality time in training and continuous improvement activities.

Weekly scheduling cycles to achieve level-loading of mix and volume, which cause significant planning delays, are eliminated. It becomes possible to produce any product on any day in response to real customer demand making possible a true Demand Flow.

As a result, In-Progress and Finished inventories are all but eliminated, converted permanently into cash at full market value through much faster response to customer orders.

Cash released from Working Capital in this way no longer has to be reinvested in inventory. It becomes available to retire debt, fund growth and innovation etc.

===Material Kanban===

DFT shares a conventional definition of material [[Kanban]] based on a visual signal to replenish a point of consumption with required material.  A typical material Kanban system in DFT is "Single Card, Multiple Container" and enables card or container quantities to be consumed and replenished without shortages.

Material Kanban provides an alternative to kitting as a way of issuing material to the production floor.  A DFT environment will strive to simplify the definition of [[warehouse]] locations for material and reduce the number of transactions required to control the flow of material during production.  The aim of Material Kanban is to connect the material flow with actual requirement at the process and provide a more robust availability of parts to production whilst reducing the response-time to the customer.

===Production Kanban===

Production Kanban is designed for a replenishment quantity that may be smaller than a lot size or batch.  It is based on a "dual card Kanban" system where a "move" card or container represents the quantity required by the downstream point of consumption and a "produce" card is kept on a display board and accumulates to a replenishment batch.

===Demand-based management===

Demand-based management is an approach that defines tolerance capability for demand in order to unify material and [[production planning]] under conditions of demand uncertainty.  It uses "flex fences" to set the upper and lower boundaries of supply against a definition of the current daily rate of demand.  The current rate is usually some kind of [[average|smoothed average]] and will move over time.  The flex-fences will be different for different product items or groups and should be calculated individually.  Order policies, purchasing, inventory and production capacity will all be set against these flex fence boundaries, so these calculations will sit at the heart of [[Planning|operations planning]].

Unfortunately, this is a calculation-intensive and critical process that is largely unsupported by [[Manufacturing resource planning|MRP]]/[[Enterprise resource planning|ERP]] systems.  The lack of system tools and clash with conventional MRP planning routine are primary reason why demand-based management has not had the same level of adoption experienced by the rest of the DFT principles.

==Value and results==

Companies that implement DFT are typically looking for an improvement in the response to customer demand.  This is reflected in the lead-time or replenishment time for finished product and will affect the level of inventory that is held to buffer response requirements.
Effective response to demand can be described as a distribution curve, with some orders taking longer to fill than others.  The result is variation and uncertainty in the manufacturer’s ability to serve the market.  [[Working capital]] is required to hedge this response lag and uncertainty.

DFT aims to reduce both the variation and duration of response to demand.  This can be seen as a more capable fulfillment that provides a higher level of customer service at a lower level of working capital.  The intended results are improvement in delivery performance together with increased [[cash-flow]] and return on working capital.

==Applications==

Demand flow technology is applicable in a wide range of product environments and has been successfully deployed in many different industries.  Companies who have embraced demand flow technology include [[John Deere]],&lt;ref&gt;Demand Flow Technology, Not Just a Manufacturing Strategy, YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWfKpJTLK7U&amp;feature=youtube_gdata&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="STANLEY-WORKS-Mar-1997-10-K"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edgar.secdatabase.com/210/95013697000279/filing-main.htm |title=STANLEY WORKS, Form 10-K, Annual Report, Filing Date Mar 19, 1997 |publisher=secdatabase.com |accessdate =May 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;Stanleyworks (1996). Form 10-K&lt;/ref&gt; [[Flextronics]], [[American Standard Companies]],&lt;ref name="E. Kampouris, Long Range Planning pp. 82-95"/&gt; [[Trane]], [[AstraZeneca]] and many others.  It has a strength in those manufacturing operations that are expected to supply a high mix to an unpredictable and volatile market.  It is often seen as the science behind flow manufacturing for discrete manufacturers, whose products do not naturally flow across the manufacturing processes.

==Advantages and criticisms==

===Advantages===

====It is simple====
Demand flow technology provides a simple, logical method based on applied mathematics.  The technique is based on simple operators of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division so it does not rely on advanced mathematics.

====It is repeatable====
DFT forms a step-by-step guide to converting production from a scheduled-push to a demand-pull and flow system.  Although it is applicable to a wide range of products, the steps are consistent and work in the same way.  It does not depend on the judgment of an expert in the same way as lean or Six Sigma and can be taught to a broader audience though short training workshops.

====It is effective====
At its heart, DFT formalizes the natural flow of material, processes and information required to build a product.  It is not so much an invented technology as a description of the optimal way to align a factory towards customer demand.

====It is customer-centric====
DFT places the customer at the center of the operation.  It enables companies to formalise a customer-centric view with practical tasks and actions that guide behaviour in the organisation.  It moves the concept of [[customer-driven]] to an achievable plan of action beyond a statement of philosophy.

====It aligns business and customer goals====
The concept of maximizing shareholder value is often seen as a conflict with the quality of customer service.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Welch.  (2009) Welch condemns share price focus, Financial Times, 12 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Demand Flow Technology, if applied correctly, can unify financial and customer objectives in a holistic approach to managing operating capital and growing a business.

===Criticisms===

====It is constrained to the factory====
Demand flow techniques have been widely applied to the factory, yet have failed to gain widespread acceptance in corporate management.  All too often, it tends to be limited to production planning whilst operations and material planning continue to be dominated by use of ERP/MRP systems.  The holistic ideal of demand flow may be fractured by this conflict.

====It is unsupported by systems====
Major ERP/MRP vendors have largely ignored the advantages of Demand Flow techniques, or been acquired before their products have had a chance to gain market share.  The advocates and users of Demand Flow have largely failed to challenge the inadequate logic that conventional MRP uses for planning [[capacity planning|capacity]] and [[capacity planning|production resources]] &lt;ref&gt;Mabert, Vincent A. (2006) The early road to material requirements planning, The Journal of Operations Management.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pochet, Yves. Wolsey, Laurence A. (2000).  Production planning by mixed integer programming.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, manufacturers are forced to rely on an outdated routine for planning that is largely unchanged since the 1960s.

====It requires process definition and discipline====
DFT aims to apply a standard process definition of product to daily requirements of demand.  This favours processes that are capable and defined to the task level.  This is sometimes a level of detail and discipline absent from the organisation.  The creation and maintenance of Sequence of Events documentation involves extensive manual work.  There are powerful advantages to quality and capability in performing this work, but success usually depends on management commitment to change beyond the narrow actions of a DFT implementation.

'''''Du-reformen''''' ({{IPA-sv|ˈdʉː reˈfɔrmən}}, ''the you-reform'') was the process in the late 1960s of popularization of the [[Grammatical person|second-person]] [[singular number|singular]] [[pronoun]] ''du'' as a universal form of address in [[Sweden]]. The use of ''[[wikt:du#Swedish|du]]'' ([[cognate]] with English ''[[thou]]'', French ''tu'', and German ''du'') replaced an intricate former system where people chiefly addressed each other in third person, with or without a preceding Mr./Mrs./Ms. ''(herr, fru ''or'' fröken)'' before the title, often omitting both [[surname]] and given name. Less respectfully, people could be addressed with Mr./Mrs./Ms. plus surname, or in a family setting, alternatively even less respectfully, with the plain name or third person pronoun ''han'' ("he") or ''hon'' (she).

Before ''du-reformen,'' it was considered impolite to address most people without an appropriate title, although a subordinate could be addressed by name, or less respectfully as ''Ni'' or ''han/hon.'' The informal ''du'' had been used for addressing children, siblings, close friends and possibly for [[cousin]]s, but hardly for elder relatives. Members of [[Free church]]es, [[Good Templars]] and the like considered each other as siblings, and may well have used ''Du'' in that setting.

With exception for [[dialect]]al usage, the second person plural pronoun ''Ni'' had long been considered degrading when used to address a single person. However, the usage varied between different parts of the country, and as well by social context, both before and after the reform. 

[[Finland-Swedish]] has undergone a similar development, but slower and slightly less due to influence of the somewhat more conservative usage in [[Finnish language|Finnish]]. In particular, the use of second person plural ''(Ni)'' to address an unknown person is considered respectful or neutral rather than degrading.

==History==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2012}}
In the Swedish of Sweden, the polite ''ni'' was known from earlier epochs, but had come to be considered careless, bullying or rude; instead, an intricate system had evolved in order to prudently step around pronouns almost altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sweden.se/eng/Home/Education/Swedish-language/Reading/How-the-Swedish-language-lost-its-formality/ |title=How the Swedish language lost its formality |last=Hellström |first=Elin |author= |date=Jun 7, 2011 |year= |department= |website=sweden.se |series= |publisher=[[Swedish Institute]] |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120911224725/http://www.sweden.se/eng/Home/Education/Swedish-language/Reading/How-the-Swedish-language-lost-its-formality/ |archive-date=2012-09-11 |dead-url=yes |access-date=Feb 1, 2017 |quote=Previously, the proper way to address people of the same or higher social status had been by title and surname. Colleagues spoke to each other in a more formal way at the office, asking if  “Accountant Olsson could send the invoice” or if “Managing Director Johnsson would mind postponing the meeting.” The use of herr (mr), fru (mrs) or fröken (miss) was considered acceptable in initial conversation with strangers of unknown occupation, academic title or military rank. |ref= |postscript= |subscription= |registration= |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Addressing in third [[person (grammar)|person]] singular adding '''title and surname''' was considered proper and respectful in most cases. But with persons of higher standing, say a doctor, count or managing director, there arose the question when to use that title only and when to precede it with a ''herr'' ('mister' or, in this context, 'sir'); not doubling such titles could be very rude unless you were on somewhat informal terms.  A woman, married to a husband with a specific title, was addressed using the ''feminine form of her husband's title'' as a matter of course. This created its own set of problems as more and more women acquired professional titles of their own.

*If two persons were somewhat acquainted and not too far apart in rank and age, they could then drop the name and use the '''title only'''. 

*'''Surname without title''' was considered proper between friends not too close and for a superior to his subordinate or someone of similar rank. That was also customary in male brotherhoods like between students.

*Below that on the social scale, both among peers and from above, was the '''third person singular pronoun only''' (''han'' 'he', ''hon'' 'she'). That was more usual in the countryside; considered rustic by "educated" people, but fitting towards e.g. an old fisher- or woodman.

*Simple folks of venerable age could be properly addressed '''father/mother/aunt plus Christian name''' ''(far/mor/moster)'', both by their own, by other villagers and by superiors. A farmwife could be addressed as ''mor'' even if young; otherwise, one had to make do with the nearest-fitting other way of addressing.

*A master could address his servant, and a farmer his farmhand, by '''Christian name in the third person'''; that was more common between females, as the female world was generally more confined, but more restricted between the sexes. A subordinate, in each case, answered by using the superior's title or, in private, the informal term for his rank (e.g. ''herrn'', ''patron'').

*The proper '''kinship term plus Christian name''', still never alternating with pronoun, was proper in private to nearer relatives.

The second person singular ''du'' was used only to and between children, within a married couple, between lovers or to a more or less voluntary mistress of lower standing, and between friends who had toasted for brotherhood with each other ('toasted for thou' in a ''"du-skål"'' as it was known)—of course initiated by the elder or higher-ranked party. Again, the custom could be slightly more relaxed among women—at least the toast itself was usually dispensed with. Otherwise, ''du'' could be used to insult a tramp or the like.

Parts of this system began to erode around the Second World War or so, but the essentials held up into the late 1960s.

In the province of [[Dalarna]], however, and in a some other remote places with few upper-class people, the ''du/ni'' distinction had remained one of number only; although children addressed their parents with Father/Mother ''(Far/Mor)'' rather than a grammatically logical ''du.'' In other remote places, the ''Ni'' survived in its older form ''I'' (cognate with '[[Ye (pronoun)|ye]]') as both the second person plural pronoun and the polite address to singular elders, including one's parents, unless classified with "better people". In [[Standard language|standard]] Swedish, that form had become archaic and solemn well before the 20th century. (''I'' is capitalized to avoid confusion with a common [[homograph]], the preposition ''[[wikt:i#Swedish|i]]'' ('in'), rather than of respect.)

As the twentieth century progressed, this circumlocutive system of addressing, with its innumerable ambiguities and opportunities for unintentional offence, was increasingly felt as a nuisance. An early way out was to carry the circumlocutions one degree further—finding impersonal ways of saying what was needful, avoiding both personal pronoun and title (''Får det lov att vara en kopp kaffe?'', approximately 'Might it be a cup of coffee?'; ''Så det är till att resa?'', approximately 'So, it is about travelling?'), often using the [[passive voice]]. However, that soon proved of little avail. For one thing, you still had to address the person you talked with directly from time to time in the conversation, otherwise you would really have sounded impolite—and over time, it became ''de rigueur'' to do so more and more often, until it was a system with both longish titles used instead of personal pronouns and impersonal circumlocutions; and for another, the impersonal constructions soon acquired their own gradations, to be observant upon—e.g., that in the second example above being perceived as more and more rustic, ending up rude.

==Reform==
The beginning of ''du-reformen'' is associated with [[Bror Rexed]], the then head of the [[National Board of Health and Welfare (Sweden)|National Board of Health and Welfare]] (''Socialstyrelsen''), who in his welcome speech to the staff in 1967 announced that he would address everyone as ''du'', increasing the effects of the reform and bringing it to a more frequent use. 

The actual reform had started earlier, including the amended language in the major newspaper [[Dagens Nyheter]]. It was seen as a reform in a democratic and egalitarian direction. First, authorities and influential circles had tried rehabilitating the ''Ni'' in a so-called "''ni''-reform". But most people could not bring themselves to feel civil using that. Then, in a process dubbed the "''du'' reform", the system rapidly broke down and the informal ''du'' became the accepted way of addressing any one person except royalty.

Addressing [[Swedish Royal Family]] also changed, but third person addressing still dominates in official settings. The universal ''ers majestät'' ('Your Majesty'), etc. became rare, possibly used on formal occasions, and is replaced by ''[[wikt:konung#Swedish|konungen]]'' or ''[[wikt:kung#Swedish|kungen]]'' ("the King"), ''kronprinsessan'' ("the Crown Princess"), etc. 

In parallel with ''du-reformen'', the use of [[title]]s was further reduced. In many other countries, [[professional title]]s rather than names are used to attract someone’s attention, while this is not usually the case in Sweden. Only slightly less accepted is the use of [[Christian name]] also when addressing an  acquaintance or colleague (''Daniel, Pia,'' etc.).

Since about 1990, it has become somewhat more common for retail and restaurant staff to address customers as ''ni'' (second-person plural), although this was not formerly considered formal language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ne.se/ni-tilltal Nationalencyklopedin].&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Riksdag]], where debate is conducted via the [[Speaker of the Riksdag|Speaker]], titles are frequently used, even though politicians are most often addressed as ''du'' in other contexts.

In order to "alleviate the intrusion" in writing, e.g. in letters or in advertisement, the ''Du'' can be capitalized. That usage was most widespread in the early days of universal ''du'' address; it has become slightly more common again simultaneously with the partial ''Ni'' revival.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5354">'''EconMult''' is a general [[fishing fleet|fleet]] [[model (abstract)|model]] to be used in [[fishery|fisheries]] modelling. EconMult has been developed since 1991 as a part of the Multispecies management programme by the [[Norwegian Research Council]] at the [[Norwegian College of Fishery Science]] ([[University of Tromsø]], [[Norway]]).

==Model resolution and key variables==
EconMult is a [[discrete time]] [[simulation]] model where the fleet activity is controlled by two [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]]: ''Number of vessels ('''v''')'' (within each fleet segment) and ''Number of fishing days '''d''')'' (within each time interval). ''The biomass units'' ('''''x''''') are exogenous variables. The model resolution is determined by four structural variables: ''Number of fleet groups '''j''')'', ''Number of targeted species '''n''')'', ''Number of biomass units '''i''')'' (which may be more than one within each targeted species) and ''Period length'' (time step in the simulation). The number of vessels and fishing days therefore are presented in fleet (columns)-targeted species (rows) matrices, while the biomass units is presented in a column vector ('''''X'''''):

{|
|&lt;math&gt;
V = \begin{pmatrix} 
v_{1,1} &amp; \cdots &amp; v_{1,n} \\ \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\ v_{j,1} &amp; \cdots &amp; v_{j,n}
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
| style="padding-left:2em" |
&lt;math&gt;
D = \begin{pmatrix} 
d_{1,1} &amp; \cdots &amp; d_{1,n} \\ \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\ d_{j,1} &amp; \cdots &amp; d_{j,n}
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
| style="padding-left:2em" |
&lt;math&gt;X = \begin{pmatrix} x_{1} \\ \vdots \\ x_{i} \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
| style="padding-left:2em" |
&lt;math&gt;i \ge n &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;j &gt; 0 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|}

==Catch production==
A ''fishery'' is in EconMult defined as a unique fleet/targeted species combination. The total catch within each fishery may include all biomass units defined in the model. Each biomass unit vessel catch is computed by [[Cobb–Douglas]] [[production function]], applying two input variables: ''number of fishing days '''d''')'' and ''biomass unit '''x''')''. In the matrix below each column represents a fleet group and each row a targeted species so each element in the matrix is a fishery and gives the vessel catch of the biomass units represented. The biomass units represent all the targeted species. Each catch is represented a Cobb–Douglas production equation as shown in the vessel yield matrix (Y):

&lt;math&gt;
Y_{V} = \begin{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 
q_{1,1,1} d_{1,1} v_{1,1}^{\alpha_{1,1,1}-1} x_{1}^{\beta_{1,1,1}} \\ \vdots \\ q_{1,1,i} d_{1,1} v_{1,1}^{\alpha_{1,1,i}-1} x_{i}^{\beta_{1,1,i}} 
\end{pmatrix} &amp; \cdots &amp; \begin{pmatrix}
q_{1,n,1} d_{1,n} v_{1,n}^{\alpha_{1,n,1}-1} x_{1}^{\beta_{1,n,1}} \\ \vdots \\ q_{1,n,i} d_{1,n} v_{1,n}^{\alpha_{1,n,i}-1} x_{i}^{\beta_{1,n,i}} 
\end{pmatrix} \\ \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\ \begin{pmatrix} 
q_{j,1,1} d_{j,1} v_{j,1}^{\alpha_{j,1,1}-1} x_{1}^{\beta_{j,1,1}} \\ \vdots \\ q_{j,1,i} d_{j,1} v_{j,1}^{\alpha_{j,1,i}-1} x_{i}^{\beta_{j,1,i}} 
\end{pmatrix} &amp; \cdots &amp; \begin{pmatrix}
q_{j,n,1} d_{j,n} v_{j,n}^{\alpha_{j,n,1}-1} x_{1}^{\beta_{j,n,1}} \\ \vdots \\ q_{j,n,i} d_{j,n} v_{j,n}^{\alpha_{j,n,i}-1} x_{i}^{\beta_{j,n,i}} 
\end{pmatrix} \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

The corresponding fleet catches are

&lt;math&gt;
Y = \begin{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 
q_{1,1,1} d_{1,1} v_{1,1}^{\alpha_{1,1,1}} x_{1}^{\beta_{1,1,1}} \\ \vdots \\ q_{1,1,i} d_{1,1} v_{1,1}^{\alpha_{1,1,i}} x_{i}^{\beta_{1,1,i}} 
\end{pmatrix} &amp; \cdots &amp; \begin{pmatrix}
q_{1,n,1} d_{1,n} v_{1,n}^{\alpha_{1,n,1}} x_{1}^{\beta_{1,n,1}} \\ \vdots \\ q_{1,n,i} d_{1,n} v_{1,n}^{\alpha_{1,n,i}} x_{i}^{\beta_{1,n,i}} 
\end{pmatrix} \\ \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\ \begin{pmatrix} 
q_{j,1,1} d_{j,1} v_{j,1}^{\alpha_{j,1,1}} x_{1}^{\beta_{j,1,1}} \\ \vdots \\ q_{j,1,i} d_{j,1} v_{j,1}^{\alpha_{j,1,i}} x_{i}^{\beta_{j,1,i}} 
\end{pmatrix} &amp; \cdots &amp; \begin{pmatrix}
q_{j,n,1} d_{j,n} v_{j,n}^{\alpha_{j,n,1}} x_{1}^{\beta_{j,n,1}} \\ \vdots \\ q_{j,n,i} d_{j,n} v_{j,n}^{\alpha_{j,n,i}} x_{i}^{\beta_{j,n,i}} 
\end{pmatrix} \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

''α'' ''β'' and ''q'' are parameters, the first two known as output elasticities of effort and biomass respectively, ''q'' is often referred to as ''the catchability coefficient''. All the three parameters have the same dimension as the matrix above, e.g. the catchability coefficient:

&lt;math&gt;Q = \begin{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 
q_{1,1,1} \\ \vdots \\ q_{1,1,i} 
\end{pmatrix} &amp; \cdots &amp; \begin{pmatrix}
q_{1,n,1} \\ \vdots \\ q_{1,n,i} 
\end{pmatrix} \\ \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\ \begin{pmatrix} 
q_{j,1,1} \\ \vdots \\ q_{j,1,i} 
\end{pmatrix} &amp; \cdots &amp; \begin{pmatrix}
q_{j,n,1} \\ \vdots \\ q_{j,n,i} 
\end{pmatrix} \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

== Early life, career and education ==
Linwood was born July 14, 1956 in Lowell and attended Billerica Memorial High School&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/warriorbillerica1974unse|title=1974 Billerica Memorial High School Year Book, pg. 66|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Massachusetts before moving to [[New York City]] when he was nineteen. He came out as a gay man just before the [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] epidemic struck. Testing positive for the HIV virus in the early 1980s led him to a life of activism around this condition. Linwood worked in the field of electronic publishing most of his life. He earned dual Bachelor degrees in sociocultural anthropology and philosophy from [[New York University]] (NYU) in 1982, then attended the [[University of Chicago]] through 1983. He earned dual Masters degrees in Arts and Education from [[San Francisco State University]]’s (SFSU) Interdisciplinary Arts Program in 1993. He attended [[New College School of Law]] in San Francisco through a state-funded HIV empowerment grant,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Law school graduation a first for four New College students|last=Laird|first=Cynthia|date=May 24, 2001|work=San Francisco Bay Area Reporter|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became a California attorney in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://members.calbar.ca.gov/fal/Member/Detail/220890|title=State Bar of CA :: Elliott   Linwood|last=California|first=The State Bar of|website=members.calbar.ca.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influences ==
Linwood was influenced by the work of [[Christine Tamblyn]], a feminist media artist and critic, who was Linwood’s instructor and mentor at SFSU. Tamblyn studied under [[Allan Kaprow]], the originator of [[Happening]]s and Life Art,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-02-14|title=Allan Kaprow|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Allan_Kaprow&amp;oldid=765421639|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[University of California, San Diego|University of California San Diego]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-02-17|title=Christine Tamblyn|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Christine_Tamblyn&amp;oldid=766041198|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through Tamblyn’s tutelage Linwood learned about the performative aspects of Life Art. In a 1991 interview with her Linwood wrote, “In her role as art instructor, Christine Tamblyn teaches that happenings, process-oriented conceptual art, body art, feminist art, persona art, even documentation art . . . can all be considered ‘Life Art."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Life Art: Performing Christine Tamblyn|last=Linwood|first=Elliott|date=1991|work=The San Francisco Sentinel|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At NYU Linwood was also introduced to works of anthropologist [[Gregory Bateson]] which analyzed rituals&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Naven: A Survey of the Problems Suggested by a Composite Picture of the Culture of a New Guinea Tribe Drawn from Three Points of View|last=Bateson|first=Gregory|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=1936|isbn=0-80470520-8|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; using [[cybernetics]] and [[Systems theory in anthropology|systems theory]] models.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Steps to an Ecology of Mind: Collected Essays in Anthropology, Psychiatry, Evolution and Epistemology|last=Bateson|first=Gregory|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1976|isbn=0-226-03905-6|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas, combined with his practical knowledge of computer programming and design of index and list publications, informed his art practice.

Film director [[Blue (1993 film)|Dereck Jarman’s movie ''Blue'']]'','' also influenced work that Linwood presented in “Share Your Vision,”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.visualaids.org/projects/detail/share-your-vision|title=Share Your Vision catalog|last=|first=|date=2003|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; for which he won first place and an award. This outreach exhibition was organized to raise awareness about [[Cytomegalovirus retinitis|CMV retinitis]], a preventable condition that causes blindness in people with compromised immune systems. Organized by Visual AIDS&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.visualaids.org/|title=Visual AIDS, NY, NY|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hoffmann-La Roche|Roche Pharmaceuticals]], the show was presented at [[Artists Space]] in New York City in 2003. An homage to Jarman’s film (consisting entirely of a blue lit movie screen with dialog of the artist visiting doctors about his loss of sight) appears in Linwood’s ''Halos,'' which reads as blurred silhouettes like dark pupils immersed in a field of iris blue light.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.visualaids.org/gallery/detail/460|title=Visual AIDS Online Gallery|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Teaching ==
Linwood developed core graduate curricula in Life Art which he taught at SFSU. These seminars explored conceptual and de-materialized art forms,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Six Years: The Dematerialization of the Art Object from 1966 to 1972|last=Lippard|first=Lucy|publisher=University of California Press|year=1997|isbn=978-0520210134|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ephemera (printed matter, video, digital communication, etc.) generated around performance spectacles, as documentary records, which might then be commodified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Performance Artist Nao Bustamante's Wake Up Calls|last=Linwood|first=Elliott|date=1994|work=San Francisco Bay Area Reporter|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural criticism ==
Linwood wrote for ''High Performance Magazine'' in Los Angeles, and the ''Bay Area Reporter'', ''The Sentinel'' and ''PhotoMetro'' in San Francisco from 1990 to 1994. Some of the writers and artists Linwood wrote about include [[Christine Tamblyn]], [[Nao Bustamante]], [[Sheree Rose]], [[Millie Wilson]], [[Carrie Mae Weems]], [[Diamanda Galás|Diamanda Gallas]], The Theory Girls, [[Jerome Caja]], Cliff Hengst, [[Paul Monette]], [[Sapphire (author)|Sapphire]], [[Dodie Bellamy]], [[Kevin Killian]], [[Justin Chin]], The Hittite Empire, [[Joe Goode]] and others.

== "Stand Up Theory" ==

Of ''Initiation,'' a sculpture referencing AIDS and made of honey, Tamblyn wrote, “The piece adroitly expressed the melancholic sensibility that the disease evokes by capitalizing on honey’s association with seduction, entrapment and preservation.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Boys Club, Craft Hut, Carnival or Cyberspace?|last=Tamblyn|first=Christine|date=1993|work=High Performance Magazine|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Photo grids &amp; cross-referencing installations ==
[[File:Halos.jpg|thumb|Elliott Linwood's ''Halos,'' part of an exhibition Share Your Vision, 2003]]
Linwood is best known for his large-scale photo grids composed of original and found images culled from the environment, the Internet, cult movies and magazine ads. His cross-referencing installations are similarly made up of found and fabricated objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.visualaids.org/artists/detail/elliott-linwood|title=Visual AIDS, Elliott Linwood (detail)|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both bodies of work share similar characteristics, such as a non-linear viewpoint and an indexical relationship between the images and objects presented, which in turn point to things outside their framing device.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Elliott Linwood at Morphos|last=Hormel|first=Julie|date=1994|work=Visions Art Quarterly|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His sculptures, ''Initiation,'' and ''Resistance,'' and his projection ''Citizen Pan,'' were displayed in ''A Living Testament of the Blood Fairies'' at Artists Space in New York in 1997,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://artistsspace.org/exhibitions/a-living-testament-of-the-blood-fairies|title=A Living Testament of the Blood Fairies at Artists Space|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; an exhibition that Frank Moore curated around text-based work.

== Reception ==

Holland Cotter in the April 1997 ''Art in America'' wrote of the exhibition: “The bittersweet tone was set [by] pieces by Elliott Linwood which opened the show. One was a slide projection of words from Sir J.M. Barrie’s ''Peter Pan:'' ‘When the first baby laughed for the first time, the laugh broke into a thousand pieces and spread over the entire world, and that was the beginning of fairies. But all the fairies are dying now because children know such a lot they don’t believe or laugh anymore.’”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.artinamericamagazine.com/news-features/magazine/from-the-archives-art-aids-the-stuff-life-is-made-of/print/|title=Art &amp; AIDS - The Stuff Life is Made Of|last=Cotter|first=Holland|date=1997|work=Art in America|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bill Arning, in the December 10, 1996 ''Village Voice'' also wrote about Linwood’s work in the exhibition, “This synthesis of queer politics, camp humour, dark children’s stories, and magic sets us up for a different kind of AIDS show than New York has seen before.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Days With Artt|last=Arning|first=Bill|date=1996|work=Village Voice|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Feminism sidebar|concepts}}

[[Feminism]] is the theory of the political, economic, and social equality of the sexes,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/feminism Merriam-Webster dictionary], as accessed April 1, 2018, entry ''feminism'', sense 1.&lt;/ref&gt; even though many [[feminist movements and ideologies]] differ on exactly which claims and strategies are vital and justifiable to achieve equality.

However, equality, while supported by most feminists, is not universally seen as the required result of the feminist movement, even by feminists. Some consider it feminist to increase the rights of women from an origin that is less than man's without obtaining full equality.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wollstonecraft|2009|p=158}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Echols|1989|pp=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Echols_Snitow_11_12"&gt;{{harvp|Echols|1989|pp=289}}, citing Snitow, Ann, ''Retrenchment vs. Transformation: The Politics of the Anti-Pornography Movement'', in ''Caught Looking: Feminism, Pornography and Censorship'' (N.Y.: Caught Looking, 1986), pp. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt; Their premise is that some gain of power is better than nothing. At the other end of the continuum, a minority of feminists have argued that women should set up at least one women-led society and some institutions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrea Dworkin]]: [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/may/13/politics1 "Take No Prisoners", in ''The Guardian'', May 13, 2000], as accessed September 6, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Spender_151_214"&gt;[[Dale Spender|Spender, Dale]], ''For the Record: The Making and Meaning of Feminist Knowledge'' (London: The Women's Press, 1985 ({{ISBN|0-7043-2862-3}})), p.&amp;nbsp;151 (on institutions) but see p.&amp;nbsp;214 (antibureaucratic).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chesler_298_299"&gt;Chesler, Phyllis, ''Women and Madness'' (Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday, 1972 ({{ISBN|0-385-02671-4}})), pp.&amp;nbsp;298-299.&lt;/ref&gt;

Freedom is sought by those among feminists who believe that equality is undesirable or irrelevant, although some equate gaining an amount of freedom equal to that of men to the pursuit of equality, thus joining those who claim equality as central to feminism.&lt;ref name="FeminismAbyssFree-passim-espp96-nn11-15"&gt;{{harvp|Zerilli|2005|loc=''passim'', esp. p. 96 &amp; nn. 11–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Charlotte-WhatIsFeminism"&gt;Gilman, Charlotte Perkins, ''What is "Feminism"?'', in ''The Sunday Herald'', Sep. 3, 1916, [§] ''Magazine'', p. [7] [of §], of ''The Boston Herald'' (Boston, Mass.).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Agreement on definition==
According to Tilburg University women's studies chair Tineke M. Willemsen, "[i]t is hardly even possible to give a definition of feminism that every feminist will agree with".&lt;ref&gt;Willemsen, Tineke M., ''Feminism and Utopias: An Introduction'', in Lenning, Alkeline van, Marrie Bekker, &amp; Ine Vanwesenbeeck, eds., ''Feminist Utopias: In a Postmodern Era'' (Tilburg Univ. Press, 1997 ({{ISBN|90-361-9747-3}})), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Bronwyn Winter has criticized resistance to defining ''feminism'' for specialists and nonspecialists, a resistance "so widespread as to appear to be the dominant feminist theoretical position: a sort of 'non-position'".&lt;ref&gt;[http://fty.sagepub.com/content/1/1/105 Winter, Bronwyn, ''Who Counts (or Doesn't Count) What as Feminist Theory?: An Exercise in Dictionary Use'', in ''Feminist Theory'', vol. 1, no. 1 (April, 2000)], as accessed Apr. 5, 2012 (possibly via different URL), p. 106 (internal single quotation marks so in original) (DOI 10.1177/14647000022229092).&lt;/ref&gt; However, definitions have been offered in feminist literature and practice.{{Citation needed|reason=References to some relatively widely accepted definitions would be useful here.|date=September 2018}}

==Equality==
Much of the literature defines ''feminism'' as being about equal rights for women or equality between the sexes. Not only did feminism influence equality among genders, but also in race. The Chicana Feminism Movement became politically active in the search for female and lesbian equality within American society. It challenged the roles of gender stereotypes.

Using different language, Riane Eisler, "re-examining human society from a gender-holistic perspective", "propose[d] ... two basic models of society", "[t]he first ... [being] the ''dominator'' model, ... what is popularly termed either patriarchy or matriarchy—the ''ranking'' of one half of humanity over the other" and "[t]he second, in which social relations are primarily based on the principle of ''linking'' rather than ranking, may best be described as the ''partnership'' model. In this model—beginning with the most fundamental difference in our species, between male and female—diversity is not equated with either inferiority or superiority."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Eisler|1987|p=xvii}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[T]he problem is not men as a sex, but men and women as they must be socialized in a dominator system."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Eisler|1987|p=185}}&lt;/ref&gt; She advocated for a gylany, a partnership linking the two genders, in lieu of the present and historical androcracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Eisler|1987|pp=185–203, 205–214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of historical interest, [[Plato]], according to Elaine Hoffman Baruch, around 394 &lt;small&gt;B.C.&lt;/small&gt;, while believing that men ultimately would excel, argued that women should be equal with men politically, socially, sexually, educationally, and in military combat and should be able to enter the highest class of society, that most gender differences could not be explained by biology (Plato being one of the earliest published thinkers to say so), and that a system of [[child care]] would free women to participate in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Schönpflug|2008|pp=159–160}}, citing Rohrlich, R. &amp; Elaine Hoffman Baruch, ''Women in Search of Utopia: Mavericks and Mythmakers'' (N.Y.: Schocken Books, 1984), and Plato, ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'' (''ca.'' 394 B.C.).&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[radical feminism|radical feminist]]s critiqued equality, denying that "equality in an unjust society was worth fighting for".&lt;ref name="DaringBad-p139"&gt;{{harvp|Echols|1989|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ambiguous on equality==
{{see| Egalitarianism}}
"Feminism makes claims for a rebalancing between women and men of the social, economic, and political power within a given society, on behalf of both sexes in the name of their common humanity, but with respect for their differences."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Offen|1988|pp=151–152}}&lt;/ref&gt; When ''feminism'' and related words began being widely used in the 1890s in Europe and the Western Hemisphere and continuing into modern times, the terms' relationship to equality was often unclear. "Then, as now, many parties used the terms polemically, as epithets, rather than analytically; then, as now, the words were not used by everyone to mean the same thing. And, as the study of their history reveals, they referred far more often to the 'rights of women' than to 'rights equal to those of men.' This is a subtle but profound distinction. Even then the vocabulary of feminism connoted a far broader sociopolitical critique, a critique that was woman-centered and woman-celebratory in its onslaught on male privilege."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Offen|1988|p=128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminist author bell hooks&lt;!-- bell hooks is an author who spells her name entirely in lower case. --&gt; wrote, "Masses of people think that feminism is always and only about women seeking to be equal to men.... The feminism they hear about the most is portrayed by women who are primarily committed to gender equality — equal pay for equal work, and sometimes women and men sharing household chores and parenting."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|hooks|2000|pp=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[F]eminism is a movement to end sexist oppression."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|hooks|2000|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deborah Siegel "use[s] the term ["feminism"] in a general sense to refer to the philosophy powering a movement to eradicate sexism and better women's lives."&lt;ref&gt;Siegel, Deborah, ''Sisterhood, Interrupted: From Radical Women to Grrls Gone Wild'' (N.Y.: Palgrave Macmillan, 2007 ({{ISBN|978-1-4039-8204-9}})), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sex and gender distinction|Genders (usually distinguished from sexes)]] are counted as other than two in some feminist utopian literature, according to Karin Schönpflug, analyzing works by [[Gabriel de Foigny]] (1676), [[Ursula K. Le Guin]] (1969), [[Samuel R. Delany]] (1976), [[Donna Haraway]] (1980), and Alkeline van Lenning (1995).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Schönpflug|2008|pp=23–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ascending toward equality==
Feminism in practice can be exhausting and expensive and other needs may compete for personal and organizational resources. Pragmatism may encourage seeking lesser goals, such as having more power than without feminism while not trying to seek full equality.

According to [[Alice Echols]], "Carol Hanisch ... argued that looking pretty and acting dumb were survival strategies which women should continue to use until such time as the 'power of unity' could replace them."&lt;ref name="DaringBad-p144"&gt;{{harvp|Echols|1989|p=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One feminist leader, Ann Snitow, speculated that [[difference feminism]] became preferred over [[gender equality]] so that "men might be more responsive".&lt;ref name="Echols_Snitow_11_12"/&gt;

In the late 18th century in [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]], [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] wrote in ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' of "[a]sserting the rights which women in common with men ought to contend for".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wollstonecraft|2009|p=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Let it not be concluded that I wish to invert the order of things; I have already granted, that, from the constitution of their bodies, men seem to be designed by Providence to attain a greater degree of virtue. I speak collectively of the whole sex; but I see not the shadow of a reason to conclude that their virtues should differ in respect to their nature."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wollstonecraft|2009|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; "I ... would fain convince reasonable men of the importance of some of my remarks, and prevail on them to weigh dispassionately the whole tenor of my observations.—I appeal to their understandings; and, as a fellow-creature, claim, in the name of my sex, some interest in their hearts. I entreat them to assist to emancipate their companion, to make her a ''help meet'' for them! [¶] Would men but generously snap our chains, and be content with rational fellowship instead of slavish obedience, they would find us more observant daughters, more affectionate sisters, more faithful wives, more reasonable mothers—in a word, better citizens."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wollstonecraft|2009|p=158}} (italicization so in original)
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Superiority==
According to [[Diane Davis]], radical feminisms "tend to be interested in female privilege rather than equality."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Davis|2000|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Feminist theology|Spiritual feminism]] and [[ecofeminism]], according to Prof. Davis, are interested less in equity than in finding ways to flip the ["masculine/feminine"] binary privilege"&lt;ref name="BreakingUpAtTotality-p145"&gt;{{harvp|Davis|2000|pp=145–146}}&lt;/ref&gt; to place "the 'feminine' ... on top (so to speak)."&lt;ref name="BreakingUpAtTotality-p145" /&gt; Some authors of utopian fiction wrote about "ideal worlds in which women's positions are better than men's".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Schönpflug|2008|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A minority of feminists have called for the existence of one or possibly more [[Matriarchy#In feminist thought|societies in which women would govern women and men]].&lt;ref&gt;'''Sources''':

==Freedom, apart from equality==
[[Difference feminism]] is based on the assumption that women and men are different, that for women to be equal to men means to be like men, which is not desirable.&lt;ref name="Charlotte-WhatIsFeminism" /&gt; Instead of equality, difference feminism is based on women having freedom.&lt;ref name="FeminismAbyssFree-passim-espp96-nn11-15" /&gt;

In 1916, [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]] argued for feminism without calling for "equality". Favoring women's "freedom"&lt;ref name="Charlotte-WhatIsFeminism" /&gt; and "full[ness]",&lt;ref name="Charlotte-WhatIsFeminism" /&gt; she wrote, "[f]eminism ... is the social awakening of the women of all the world. It is that great movement ... which is changing the centre of gravity in human life..... It is the movement for ... [among other goals] [women's] full economic independence..... [A]nti-feminists [speak] ... in their frantic fear of freedom for women."&lt;ref name="Charlotte-WhatIsFeminism" /&gt; She wrote of essential differences between women and men, including in motherhood and fatherhood,&lt;ref name="Charlotte-WhatIsFeminism" /&gt; and that "[f]eminists are women, plus: plus full human endowment and activity."&lt;ref name="Charlotte-WhatIsFeminism" /&gt;

== Politics ==

=== Organisations ===
Examples of organizations in the [[United States|U.S.]] seeking equality are the [[National Women's Political Caucus]] ([[National Women's Political Caucus|NWPC]]) and the [[National Organization for Women]] ([[National Organization for Women|NOW]]) and, historically, the [[National Woman's Party]] ([[National Woman's Party|NWP]]). NOW, at its first national conference, in 1967, called for equality, e.g., "Equal Rights Constitutional Amendment", "Equal and Unsegregated Education", "Equal Job Training Opportunities", "equal employment opportunity [to] be guaranteed to all women, as well as men", "the right of women to be educated to their full potential equally with men ... eliminating all discrimination and segregation by sex", and "the right of women in poverty to secure job training, housing, and family allowances on equal terms with men".&lt;ref&gt;''NOW (National Organization for Women) Bill of Rights'', in [[Robin Morgan|Morgan, Robin]], ed., ''[[Sisterhood Is Powerful|Sisterhood is Powerful: An Anthology of Writings From the Women's Liberation Movement]]'' (N.Y.: Random House, 1st ed. 1970), pp. 512–513 (§ ''Historical Documents'') ("[a]dopted at NOW's first national conference, Washington, D.C., 1967", per ''id.'', p. 512).&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Notable Politicians ===
[[Victoria Woodhull]] ran in the 1872 election to be [[President of the United States|President of the U.S.]], asserting a right to equality.&lt;ref&gt;Gabriel, Mary, ''Notorious Victoria: The Life of Victoria Woodhull, Uncensored'' (Chapel Hill, N.Car.: Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill, 1st ed. 1998 ({{ISBN|1-56512-132-5}})), ''passim'', esp. pp. 54–57 &amp; nn..&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Underhill, Lois Beachy, ''The Woman Who Ran for President: The Many Lives of Victoria Woodhull'' (Bridgehampton, N.Y.: Bridge Works, 1st ed. 1995 ({{ISBN|1-882593-10-3}})), ''passim'', esp. ch. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Nesta Helen Webster]], a political conservative in the [[United Kingdom|U.K.]] early in the 20th century, implied the genders might be equal&lt;ref name="VoiceConspiracy"&gt;Lee, Martha F., ''Nesta Webster: The Voice of Conspiracy'', in ''Journal of Women's History'', vol. 17, no. 3 (Fall, 2005), p. 81 ''ff.''&lt;/ref&gt; and believed that there had been "women's supremacy ... [in] pre-revolutionary France, when powerful women never attempted to compete directly with men, but instead drew strength from other areas where they excelled, in particular, 'the power of organisation and the power of inspiration.'"&lt;ref name="VoiceConspiracy" /&gt;

'''Forced displacement''' or '''forced immigration''' is the coerced movement of a person or people away from their [[home]] or home [[region]] and it often connotes violent coercion. Someone who has experienced forced displacement is a '''"forced immigrant"''', a '''"displaced person" (DP)''', rarely also a '''"displacee"''', or if it is within the same country, an [[internally displaced person]] (IDP). In some cases the forced immigrant can also become a [[refugee]], as that term has a specific legal definition. A specific form of forced displacement is [[population transfer]], which is a coherent policy to move unwanted groups, for example, as an attempt at [[ethnic cleansing]]. Another form is [[deportation]].

Forced displacement has accompanied persecution, as well as war, throughout human history but has only become a topic of serious study and discussion relatively recently. This increased attention is the result of greater ease of travel, allowing displaced people to flee to nations far removed from their homes, the creation of an international legal structure of human rights, and the realizations that the destabilizing effects of forced immigration, especially in parts of [[Africa]], the [[Middle East]], south and central [[Asia]], ripple out well beyond the immediate region.

== Definition ==
The concept of forced displacement envelopes demographic movements like flight, evacuation, displacement, and resettlement. The [[International Organization for Migration]] defines a forced migrant as any person who migrates to "escape persecution, conflict, repression, natural and human-made disasters, ecological degradation, or other situations that endanger their lives, freedom or livelihood".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---asia/---ro-bangkok/documents/publication/wcms_160632.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iom.int/jahia/jsp/index.jsp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110821023804/http://www.iom.int/jahia/jsp/index.jsp |archivedate=2011-08-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Association for the Study of Forced Migration]] (IASFM) defines it as "the movements of refugees and internally displaced people (those displaced by conflicts) as well as people displaced by natural or environmental disasters, chemical or nuclear disasters, famine, or development projects."&lt;ref name="forcedmigration.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forcedmigration.org/about/whatisfm/what-is-forced-migration|title=What is forced migration? — Forced Migration Online|website=www.forcedmigration.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Alden Speare, "in the strictest sense migration can be considered to be involuntary only when a person is physically transported from a country and has no opportunity to escape from those transporting him." Movement under threat, even the immediate threat to life, contains a voluntary element, as long as there is an option to escape to another part of the country, go into hiding or to remain and hope to avoid persecution."&lt;ref name=conflict/&gt; However this thought has been questioned, especially by Marxians, who argue that in most cases migrants have little or no choice.&lt;ref name=conflict&gt;{{cite web |title=FORCED MIGRATION IN INDONESIA : HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES |url=http://www.conflictrecovery.org/bin/Graeme_Hugo-Forced_Migration_in_Indonesia-Historical_Perspectives.doc |work=graeme hugo |accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Causes for forced displacement can include:
* [[Natural disaster]]: Occurrence of a disaster – such as floods, tsunamis, landslides, earthquakes or volcanoes – leads to temporary or permanent displacement of population from that area. In such a scenario, migration becomes more of a survival strategy, as natural disasters often cause the loss of money, homes, and jobs. For example, [[Hurricane Katrina]] resulted in displacement of almost the entire population of New Orleans, leaving the community and government with several economic and social challenges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://understandingkatrina.ssrc.org/Oliver-Smith/ |title=Disasters and Forced Migration in the 21st Century |work=ssrc.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Environmental problems]]: The term [[environmental refugee]] has been in use recently representing people who are forced to leave their traditional habitat because of environmental factors which negatively impact his or her livelihood, or even environmental disruption i.e. biological, physical or chemical change in ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;Terminski, Bogumil. Environmentally-Induced Displacement: Theoretical Frameworks and Current Challenges, University de Liege, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Migration can also occur as a result of slow-onset [[climate change]], such as [[desertification]] or [[sea-level rise]], of deforestation or [[land degradation]]. Man-made disasters can also cause forced migration: examples are industrial accidents and especially accidents that involve radioactivity, such as in [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]] or [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|Fukushima]]. An elaboration of such migrants is given by Essam El-Hinnawi:
# Migrants who are able to return to their original habitat once the disruption is over, as in the case of the [[Bhopal disaster]].
# Migrants  who remain permanently displaced.
# Migrants  who seek better living conditions due to deterioration of environmental conditions in their present habitat, such as soil fertility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://repository.forcedmigration.org/show_metadata.jsp?pid=fmo:1158 |title=Environment and forced migration : a review   Paper for 4th IRAP conference 5–9 January 1994, Oxford |author=Forced Migration Online, Refugee Studies Centre, Oxford Department of International Development, University of Oxford |work=forcedmigration.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the middle of the 19th century, for example, Ireland experienced a famine never before seen in the country’s history.
* [[War]], [[civil war]], [[political repression]] or [[Religious intolerance|religious conflict]]s: Some migrants are impelled to cross national borders by war or persecution, due to political, social, ethnic, religious reasons. These immigrants may be considered [[refugees]] if they apply for [[asylum seekers|asylum]] in the receiving country.&lt;ref&gt;Conventions No. 29, 105, 138 and 182; Convention No. 97 (Art. 3, Annex I; Art. 8 and Annex II, Art. 13); Convention No. 143, Part I; 1990 International Convention (Art. 21)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Development-induced displacement]]: Such displacement or [[population transfer]] is the forcing of communities and individuals out of their homes, often also their homelands, for the purposes of [[economic development]]. It has been historically associated with the construction of dams for [[hydroelectric power]] and [[irrigation]] purposes but also appears due to many other activities, such as [[mining]] and transport (roads, ports, airports). The best-known recent example of such development-induced displacement may be that resulting from the construction of the [[Three Gorges Dam]] in [[China]]. This type of forced migration disproportionately affects low income earners and ethnic minorities. According to estimates, between 90 and 100 million people were forced to leave their homes due to development projects in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="forcedmigration.org"/&gt;
* [[Human trafficking]] and [[human smuggling]]: Migrants displaced through deception or coercion with purpose of their exploitation fall under this category. The data on such forced migration are limited since the activities involved are clandestine in nature. While migration of this nature is well covered for male migrants (working in agriculture, construction etc.), same cannot be said for their female counterparts as the market situation for them might be unscrupulous (sex work or domestic service). The [[International Labour Organization]] considers trafficking an offence against labor protection and denies them the opportunity of utilizing their resources for their country. ILO’s Multilateral Framework includes principle no. 11 that recommends, "Governments should formulate and implement, in consultation with the social partners, measures to prevent abusive practices, migrant smuggling and people trafficking; they should also work towards preventing irregular labor migration.
* [[Slavery]]: History's greatest forced migration was the [[Middle Passage]] of the [[Atlantic slave trade]] during the 15th through the 19th centuries.  Of the 20 million Africans captured for the trade, half died in their forced march to the African coast, and another ten to twenty percent died on slave ships carrying them from Africa to the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part1/1p277.html |author=PBS-WGBH |title=The Middle Passage |work=Africans in America |date=1999 |accessdate=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ethnic cleansing]]: The systematic forced removal of ethnic or religious groups from a given territory by a more powerful ethnic group, with the intent of making it ethnically homogeneous.

==Conditions==

In the majority of cases forced migration across borders takes place without the required documentation. It may even involve human smugglers and traffickers. Displaced people often place their lives at risk, are obliged to travel in inhumane conditions and may be exposed to exploitation and abuse. And on top of that the states where they seek protection may regard them as a threat to their security.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unhcr.org/46f7c0ee2.pdf | page 16&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview and distinctions between the terms==
{{see|Refugee law|Refugee}}
* The term 'Refugee Studies' denotes an academic discipline or field of study which covers the study of refugees, often their experiences in seeking refuge.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cameron|first=Bobby Thomas|date=2014|title=Reflections on Refugee Studies and the Study of Refugees: Implications for Policy Analysts|url=https://bobbycameron.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/final_bobby-thomas-cameron_refugee-studies.pdf|journal=Journal of Management &amp; Public Policy|volume=6|pages=4–13|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are several categories of individuals who are included in this study, with labels that include: 'Refugee’; ‘expellees’; ‘exile’; ‘displaced person’; ‘internally displaced person (IDP)’; ‘economic refugees’; ‘humanitarian refugee’; ‘stateless person’; ‘tsunami refugee’; ‘development refugee’; ‘environmental refugee’; ‘government assisted refugee (GAR)’ etc.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

* The term displaced person (DP) was first widely used during [[World War II]] and the resulting refugee outflows from [[Eastern Europe]],&lt;ref&gt;Mark Wyman: ''Dps: Europe's Displaced Persons, 1945–1951''. Cornell University Press 1998 (reprint). {{ISBN|0-8014-8542-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; when it was used to specifically refer to one removed from his or her native country as a [[refugee]], [[prison]]er or a [[unfree labour|slave laborer]]. Most of the victims of war, political refugees and DPs of the immediate post-Second World War period were Ukrainians, Poles, other Slavs, as well as citizens of the Baltic states – Lithuanians, Latvians, and Estonians, who refused to return to Soviet-dominated eastern Europe. A.J. Jaffe claimed that the term was originally coined by [[Eugene M. Kulischer]].&lt;ref&gt;A. J. Jaffe: Notes on the Population Theory of Eugene M. Kulischer. In: ''The Milbank Memorial Fund Quarterly'', Vol. 40, No. 2. (April 1962). Pp. 187–206.[https://www.jstor.org/pss/3348648 (online)]&lt;/ref&gt; The meaning has significantly broadened in the past half-century.

* If the displaced person has crossed an international border and falls under one of the [[Refugee Law|relevant international legal instruments]], they may become a [[refugee]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/o_c_ref.htm U.N. Convention relating to status of Refugees] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080309151637/http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/o_c_ref.htm |date=March 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "refugee" is also commonly used as a synonym for displaced person, causing confusion between the general descriptive class of anyone who has left their home and the subgroup of legally defined [[refugee]]s who enjoy specified international legal protection. However, forced migrants may not apply for asylum in the country they fled to, so they may not be classed as [[asylum seeker]]s or – if application would be successful – [[refugee]]s. The terms refugee and asylum seeker always have a legal framework or system as context. If forced migrants do not access this legal system or it does not exist in the country they have fled to, they cannot be categorised as such.

* Forced migrants are always either IDPs or displaced people, as both of these terms do not require a legal framework and the fact that they left their homes is sufficient. The distinction between the terms displaced person and forced migrant is minor, however, the term displaced person has an important historic context (e.g. [[World War II]]).

* A displaced person who crosses an international border without permission from the country they are entering, and without applying for asylum, may be considered an [[illegal immigrant]].

* A displaced person who left his or her home because of political persecution or violence, but did not cross an international border, is commonly considered to be the less well-defined category of [[internally displaced person]] (IDP), and is subject to more tenuous international protection. Bogumil Terminski distinguishes two general categories of internal displacement: displacement of risk (mostly conflict-induced displacement, deportations and disaster-induced displacement) and displacement of adaptation (associated with voluntary resettlement, development-induced displacement and environmentally-induced displacement).

* If the displaced person was forced out their home because of economically driven projects like that of the [[Three Gorges Dam]] in China and various [[India]]n dams, it is called [[development-induced displacement]]. People are also often displaced due to [[natural disaster|natural]] or man-made disasters. Displacement can also occur as a result of slow-onset [[climate change]], such as [[desertification]] or [[sea-level rise]]. A person who is displaced due to environmental factors which negatively impact his or her livelihood is generally known as an [[environmental migrant]]. Such displacement can be cross-border in nature but is frequently internal. No specific international legal instrument applies to such individuals. Foreign nations often offer disaster relief to mitigate the effects of such disaster displacement.

* Displaced person generally refers to one who is forced to migrate for reasons other than economic conditions, such as war or persecution. A migrant who fled because of economic hardship is an [[economic migrant]].

==Criminal prosecution==
Forced displacement has been subjected to several trials before local and international courts. One of the requirements that need to be met for an offence as a [[war crime]] is that the victim is a "protected person" under [[international humanitarian law]]. The expression "protected person" originally referred only to the categories of individuals explicitly protected under one of the four [[Geneva Conventions of 1949]], but was later accepted as defining a [[civilian]] or police force who do not participate directly in a conflict.&lt;ref name=UNHCR&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/4e0344b344.pdf | title=Legal and Protection Policy Research Series: Forced Displacement and International Crimes |publisher=UNHCR| author=Guido Acquaviva |date=June 2011|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the end of [[World War II]], the [[Krupp trial]] was held with a specific charge to the forced displacement of civilian populations for the purpose of forced labour. The US Military Tribunal concluded that "
[t]here is no international law that permits the deportation or the use of civilians against their will for other than on reasonable requisitions for the need of the army, either within the area of the army or after deportation to rear areas or to the homeland of the occupying power".&lt;ref name=UNHCR/&gt; At the [[Nuremberg trials]], [[Hans Frank]], chief jurist in [[occupied Poland]], was found guilty, among others for forced displacement of the civilian population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/nuremberg-trial-judgements-hans-frank|title=Nuremberg Trial Judgements: Hans Frank|publisher=Jewish Virtual Library|accessdate=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Article 49, the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]], adopted on 12 August 1949, specifically forbids forced displacement:

{{quote3|Individual or mass forcible transfers, as well as deportations of protected people from occupied territory to the territory of the Occupying Power or to that of any other country, occupied or not, are prohibited, regardless of their motive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/ihl/WebART/380-600056 |publisher=[[International Committee of the Red Cross|ICRC]] |title=Convention (IV) relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War. Geneva, 12 August 1949 – DEPORTATIONS, TRANSFERS, EVACUATIONS |accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]] defines forced displacement as a crime within the jurisdiction of the court:
{{quote3|"Deportation or forcible transfer of population" means forced displacement of the people concerned by expulsion or other coercive acts from the area in which they are lawfully present, without grounds permitted under international law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/rdonlyres/ADD16852-AEE9-4757-ABE7-9CDC7CF02886/283503/RomeStatutEng1.pdf |publisher=International Criminal Court |title=Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court |year=2011 |p=7|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Several people were tried and convicted by the [[ICTY]] for connection to forced displacement during the [[Yugoslav Wars]] in the 1990s. On 11 April 2018, the Appeals Chamber sentenced [[Vojislav Šešelj]] 10 years in prison under Counts 1, 10, and 11 of the indictment for instigating [[deportation]], [[persecution]] (forcible displacement), and other inhumane acts (forcible transfer) as [[crimes against humanity]] due to his speech in Hrtkovci on 6 May 1992, in which he called for the [[expulsion of Croats from Vojvodina]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unmict.org/en/news/appeals-chamber-reverses-%C5%A1e%C5%A1elj%E2%80%99s-acquittal-part-and-convicts-him-crimes-against-humanity|title=APPEALS CHAMBER REVERSES ŠEŠELJ’S ACQUITTAL, IN PART, AND CONVICTS HIM OF CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY| date=11 April 2018| publisher=United Nations Mechanism for International Criminal Tribunals| accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.trtworld.com/europe/un-court-sentences-ultranationalist-serb-leader-to-10-years-16638|title=UN court sentences ultranationalist Serb leader to 10 years |publisher=[[TRT World]] |accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2018/04/serbia-conviction-of-war-criminal-delivers-long-overdue-justice-to-victims/|title=Serbia: Conviction of war criminal delivers long overdue justice to victims| publisher=Amnesty International| accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other convictions for forced displacement included ex-Bosnian Serb politician [[Momčilo Krajišnik]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=UN tribunal transfers former Bosnian Serb leader to UK prison |url=https://news.un.org/en/story/2009/09/311692-un-tribunal-transfers-former-bosnian-serb-leader-uk-prison| date=8 September 2009|publisher=UN News |accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ex-Croatian Serb leader [[Milan Martić]], &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=UN tribunal upholds 35-year jail term for leader of breakaway Croatian Serb state|url=https://news.un.org/en/story/2008/10/277112-un-tribunal-upholds-35-year-jail-term-leader-breakaway-croatian-serb-state|date=8 October 2008|publisher=UN News |accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; former Bosnian Croat paramilitary commander [[Mladen Naletilić]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Bosnian Croat commander convicted by UN tribunal to serve jail term in Italy |url=https://news.un.org/en/story/2008/04/257282-bosnian-croat-commander-convicted-un-tribunal-serve-jail-term-italy| date=25 April 2008|publisher=UN News |accessdate=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Bosnian Serb politician [[Radoslav Brđanin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Bosnian Serb politician convicted by UN tribunal to serve jail term in Denmark |url=https://news.un.org/en/story/2008/03/251232-bosnian-serb-politician-convicted-un-tribunal-serve-jail-term-denmark |date=4 March 2008|publisher=UN News |accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''gay–straight alliance''' ('''GSA''') is a student-led or community-based organization, found in [[Middle school#United States|middle school]]s and [[High school (North America)|high school]]s as well as [[College#United States|college]]s and [[university|universities]], primarily in the United States and Canada, that is intended to provide a safe and supportive environment for [[LGBT]] youth (or those who are perceived as such) and their [[straight ally|cisgender heterosexual allies]].{{sfn|GLBTQ|2004}} A GSA may also be known by another name such as ''gender-sexuality alliance'' or ''genders &amp; sexualities alliance''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Our Approach: Genders &amp; Sexualities Alliance Network |url=https://gsanetwork.org/about-us |website=[[GSA Network]] |accessdate=July 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In middle schools and high schools, GSAs are overseen by a responsible teacher. The first GSAs were established in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="GSA-ACLU"&gt;{{cite web |title=GSA court victories |url=https://www.aclu.org/other/gsa-court-victories-guide-lgbt-high-school-students |website=[[ACLU]] |accessdate=April 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the right of students to establish a GSA at school is guaranteed by both the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]] (with regard to every level of schooling) and the federal [[Equal Access Act]] (with regard to secondary schools where other student clubs are allowed, with the definition of secondary school for purposes of the federal law including middle schools and high schools). Since 1998, there have been at least 17 federal court cases in which high school and middle school students have conclusively prevailed in defending the free exercise of their civil rights on this issue, with federal courts consistently ruling that students have both a right to establish a GSA at school and to use the name ''Gay-Straight Alliance'' instead of an alternative name.&lt;ref name="GSA-ACLU" /&gt; In 2000, the [[United States District Court for the Central District of California]] ruled in favor of high school students whose attempt to form a GSA had been blocked by the school board, in the case of ''Colin v.

== History of the GSA Network ==
The [[GSA Network]] is an LGBT rights organization was founded in 1998 by Carolyn Laub to empower youth activists to start GSA clubs in their respective schools to motivate and inspire fellow students to fight against [[homophobia]] and [[transphobia]]. Laub initially started working with this movement in 40 GSA clubs in the [[San Francisco]] Bay area during 1988–99 and then gradually expanded to other cities and states. By 2001, The GSA Network became a statewide organization having branches in other schools in different parts of the state.  In the year 2005, it began operating programs nationally. The year 2008 saw the GSA network become incorporated as its own independent 501(c)3 non-profit organization. Prior to that, it was a fiscally sponsored project of [[The Tides Center]].  In 2015, the network hired two long time staff to serve as Co-Executive Directors to replace outgoing founder and Executive Director Carolyn Laub.  In 2016, the ''Gay-Straight Alliance Network'' formally changed its name to ''Genders &amp; Sexualities Alliance Network'' and continues to network organizations representing over 4000 GSA clubs across the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://gsanetwork.org/about-us/history |title=History of GSA Network|}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The GSA Network organization is based in [[San Francisco]] and has regional offices in [[Fresno]], [[Los Angeles]] and [[New Orleans]].

== Goal ==
The goal of most gay–straight alliances is to make their school community safe, facilitate activism on campus, and create a welcoming environment for [[LGBT]] students. They are part of the [[LGBT student movement]] and participate in national campaigns to raise awareness, such as the ''[[Day of Silence]]'', ''[[National Coming Out Day]]'', ''No Name Calling Week'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nonamecallingweek.org/cgi-bin/iowa/home.html No Name Calling Week] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151115171355/http://www.nonamecallingweek.org/cgi-bin/iowa/home.html |date=2015-11-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Transgender Day of Remembrance]]'', ''[[Harvey Milk Day]]'', ''GSA day''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gsaday.org/ |title=GSA Day for Racial Justice – Feb. 20th, 2015 |work=gsaday.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; or locally organized campaigns, such as ''Take It Back: Anti-Slur Campaign'', ''Beyond the Binary'', ''LGBTQ-Inclusive Curriculum'' and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Change Your School |url=http://gsanetwork.org/get-involved/change-your-school |website=gsanetwork.org |publisher=gsanetwork |accessdate=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many GSAs work with local chapters of the ''[[Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network]]'' (GLSEN) or ''Gay–Straight Alliance Network'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gsanetwork.org |title=Home – Gay-Straight Alliance Network |work=gsanetwork.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; a national organization supporting youth leadership. The registered number of GSAs with GLSEN is over 4000, as of 2008.&lt;ref name="glsen5q" /&gt; In California, there are over 900 GSAs registered with ''GSA Network'',&lt;ref name="GSA FAQ"&gt;{{cite web |title=Frequently Asked Questions about GSA Network |url=http://www.gsanetwork.org/about-us/faq |website=gsanetwork.org |publisher=gsanetwork |accessdate=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; representing over half of California's high schools.&lt;ref name="GSA FAQ" /&gt; Over half the states in the United States have one or more statewide groups that work with GSAs.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} Many of these state based groups and local chapters of GLSEN participate in the ''[[National Association of GSA Networks]]''. GSA Networks have been formed to help local area students to network and connect to local resources, provide training for youth leaders, and sponsor local GSA efforts.

The inclusion of [[heterosexual]] "straight allies" in the missions of these groups "is an important distinguishing factor from early support groups for LGBT teens, and recognizes the need for a comprehensive approach to youth safety," and attempts to build a network of support for [[non-heterosexual]] and [[transgender]] teens, as well as raising awareness of [[homophobia]] and [[heterosexism]].{{sfn|GLBTQ|2004}}

== Impact ==

=== Outcomes ===

==== Social ====
LGBT students routinely experience harassment in their schools however, GSAs and other support clubs have been found to provide social support for LGBT students.  Students have reported hearing homophobic remarks from both students and instructors in their schools.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[null Kosciw, J. G., Greytak, E. A., Bartkiewicz, M. J., Boesen, M. J., &amp; Palmer, N. A. (2011). The 2011 National School Climate Survey: The experiences of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender youth in our nation's schools. New York: Gay, Lesbian, &amp; Straight Education Network.]&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the more harassment students reported, the more likely the student also reported higher levels of depression and lower self-esteem.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  However, LGBT students attending a school with an active support club reported hearing less homophobic expressions and experienced less victimization than LGBT students attending a school without a GSA or support club.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Goodenow, C. , Szalacha, L. , &amp; Westheimer, K. (2006). School support groups, other school factors, and the safety of sexual minority adolescents. Psychology in the Schools, 43(5), 573-589&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, LGBT students with a GSA in their high school reported more positive outcomes when it came to high school belonging and school victimization.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Heck, N. C., Flentje, A., &amp; Cochran, B. N. (2013). Offsetting risks: High school gay-straight alliances and lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) youth. Psychology Of Sexual Orientation And Gender Diversity, 1(S), 81-90. doi:10.1037/2329-0382&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the mere presence of a GSA on campus, level of participation in a GSA has also been linked to the amount of social support reported by LGBT students.  A 2011 study by Toomey, Ryan, Diaz and Russell (2011)&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Toomey, R., Ryan, C., Diaz, R., &amp; Russell, S. T. (2011). High school gay-straight alliances (GSAs) and young adult well-being: An examination of GSA presence, participation, and perceived effectiveness. Applied Developmental Science, 15(4), 175–185.&lt;/ref&gt; found that the presence of a GSA, participation in a GSA, and perceived effectiveness of a GSA were each individually associated with youth's well being.  In certain cases, research showed these three factors protected youth's well being against victimization.  Furthermore, youths who participated in a GSA reported lower levels of depression and higher self-esteem.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

GSAs are important not only at the individual level, but also to promote the education of LGBT issues to school populations.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Stonefish, T., &amp; Lafreniere, K. D. (2015). Embracing Diversity: The Dual Role of Gay-Straight Alliances. Canadian Journal of Education, 38(4).&lt;/ref&gt;  GSA's have been found to promote social activism.  Researchers have argued that GSAs are a grassroots student initiated form of activism.  The same researchers claimed that GSAs are important to challenge the status Quo, confront discrimination, and reconceptualize gender.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==== Academic ====
LGBT youths in schools across the U.S. are subject to serious obstacles that may impact their ability to perform in school.  A 2011 study found that two thirds of LGBT students reported feeling unsafe at school.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some students felt so unsafe that they reported missing school due to safety concerns.  The same study found that the GPA of LGBT children was, on average, half a grade lower than straight.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  This may be an indicator that LGBT youth face different barriers to education than straight youth.

LGBT youth's school experience may impact their life decisions.  LGBT youth in high school were less likely to report that they wanted to pursue further education than straight youth.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  These findings suggest that LGBT youths' negative experiences in primary education relate to their decision not to continue on in the education system.  This then robs LGBT youth of all of the opportunities that advanced education offers.

However, an active GSA on a high school campus has been associated with better academic outcomes for LGBT students.  LGBT youth attending schools with an active GSA were less likely to report feeling unsafe at school and were less likely to miss school due to a threat to their safety.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Additionally, LGBT youths who had an active GSA at their high school reported higher educational attainment than LGBT youth who did not have a GSA on their high school campus.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== Health ====
GSAs are associated with better mental health outcomes for LGBT students.  LGBT students with a GSA in their high school reported less depression less general psychological distress and higher self-esteem than students without a GSA at their high school.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Students in schools that had an active GSA also reported less truancy&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;. Gay-straight alliances are associated with student health: A multi school comparison of LGBTQ and heterosexual youth. Journal of Research on Adolescence, 23, 319–330.&lt;/ref&gt;).  LGBT students with a support club in their school also reported lower levels of victimization and suicide attempts in comparison to schools without a support group&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;).

GSAs have also been associated with other reduced health risk factors.  LGBT students with a GSA in their high school reported more positive outcomes when it came to alcohol use and problems related to alcohol use.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  LGBT students with support groups in their schools reported half as much dating violence and less casual sex.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Students with an active GSA in their high school were also less likely to be threatened or injured at school in comparison to students without an active GSA.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Impact on students ===
GSAs are associated with benefits for LGBT students while they are attending school and beyond.  The next important step is to understand why GSAs are associated with these benefits.  One qualitative study found that the most beneficial aspect of a GSA was that it provides direct support to LGBTQ members and helps create a support network for LGBT students by connecting them.&lt;ref&gt;St. John, A., Travers, R., Munro, L., Liboro, R., Schneider, M., &amp; Greig, C. L. (2014). The Success of Gay-Straight Alliances in Waterloo Region, Ontario: A Confluence of Political and Social Factors. Journal of LGBT Youth, 11(2), 150-170.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another qualitative study found that GSAs were beneficial to LGBTQ students because they act as a protective factor for LGBT students' educational and social experience in school.  The study further explained that GSAs provided LGBT students with a sense of identity within their school, improved their self-esteem, and even provided students with courage and support to come out to their families and peers.&lt;ref&gt;McCormick, A., Schmidt, K., &amp; Clifton, E. (2015). Gay–straight alliances: Understanding their impact on the academic and social experiences of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning high school students. Children &amp; Schools, 37(2), 71-77. doi:10.1093/cs/cdu028&lt;/ref&gt;

One study investigated some of the possible factors within GSAs to discover which specific components of GSAs were associated with which beneficial outcomes.  This study found that when GSA advisors served for longer periods of time, students had better health outcomes.  In addition, LGBT students who perceived they had more control over their GSA experience and LGBT students who perceived their school to be more supportive had healthier outcomes.  In addition, this study reported that "students level of GSA advocacy also predicted students' sense of life purpose."&lt;ref&gt;Poteat, V. P., Yoshikawa, H., Calzo, J. P., Gray, M. L., DiGiovanni, C. D., Lipkin, A., &amp; Shaw, M. P. {{cite journal |title=Contextualizing Gay-Straight Alliances: Student, Advisor, and Structural Factors Related to Positive Youth Development Among Members |date=1 January 2015 |publisher= |journal=Child Development |volume=86 |issue=1 |pages=176–193 |doi=10.1111/cdev.12289 |pmid=25176579 |pmc=4331256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Impact after high school ===
The relationship between having a GSA in a high school and attitudes towards LGBT individuals does not end after high school.  The mere presence of a GSA, whether or not students participated in said GSA, is related to students' attitudes toward LGBT people beyond their time in their high school.  University students who reported having a GSA in their high school were more likely to report positive attitudes towards LGBT individuals while attending their university.&lt;ref&gt;Worthen, M. F. (2014). The interactive impacts of high school gay-straight alliances (GSAs) on college student attitudes toward LGBT individuals: An investigation of high school characteristics. Journal of Homosexuality, 61(2), 217-250. doi:10.1080/00918369.2013.839906.&lt;/ref&gt;  This was true for all students except students whom were raised in the southern U.S. where having a GSA in one's high school actually correlated with less positive attitudes toward LGBT individuals.

=== Impact summary ===
GSAs are associated with positive social academic and health outcomes for LGBT students.  The relationship between having a GSA in one's high school and certain positive social outcomes is known to last beyond high school, however little beyond that is known about the long lasting associations with high school GSAs.  Further research should be conducted on the lasting effects if GSAs for LGBT individuals.  Researchers have also claimed that GSAs are important not only to LGBT students, but also to change the school climate as a whole to be more informed and respectful of LGBT issues.  It has also been claimed that GSAs are important to get students involved in social activism.  Researchers should investigate the relationship between having a GSA in a high school the school's social climate. Due to the positive associations between GSAs and student outcomes, school faculty including school psychologists and counselors should become social justice advocates for LGBTQ students by supporting GSAs on their campuses.&lt;ref&gt;Bidell, M. P. (2011). School Counselors and Social Justice Advocacy for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Questioning Students. Journal of School Counseling, 9(10).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Accomplishments ===
The various accomplishments since the founding of the GSAs include:
* GSAs have played a great leadership role in the grassroots by organizing the passage of many ground-breaking, statewide legislations, like the AB 537: The California Student Safety and Violence Prevention Act of 2000 which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity.
* It has achieved a critical victory as the plaintiff in the first lawsuit filed under AB 537; which was a three-year settlement agreement which required the Visalia schools to enact sweeping reforms including mandatory teacher and student trainings that would be supportive to LGBT students.
* It also helped to pass 11 key laws to protect LGBT youth and create safer school environment.
* They also launched the [[National Association of GSA Networks]] in 2005 to unite statewide organizations to support GSAs and to accelerate the growth and impact of the GSA movement nationwide.  To date, there are 40 states which have joined the National Association in the United States of America alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://gsanetwork.org/about-us/history |title=Accomplishments of the GSA Network|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History in the United States ==
Described as "perhaps the most important precursor of the GSA movement," Los Angeles' ''Project 10'' is seen as the start of the GSA movement. Founded in 1984, ''Project 10'' was widely recognised as the first organised effort to provide support for LGBTQ youth in schools across the United States. The majority of its facilitators were heterosexual, and was named after the commonly-held statistic that 10% of the adult male population is "exclusively homosexual". ''Project 10'' focused on issues such as [[drug abuse]], [[alcohol abuse]], and discussing issues of high-risk sexual behavior.{{sfn|GLBTQ|2004}}

The first GSA was started in 1988, in [[Concord, Massachusetts]] at [[Concord Academy]] by [[Kevin Jennings]], the founder and head of the Gay Lesbian Straight Education Network [[GLSEN]]. The first public school gay–straight alliance was started at [[Newton South High School]] (Newton Centre, Massachusetts) by teacher Robert Parlin.&lt;ref&gt;Jennings, Kevin: ''Mama's Boy, Preacher's Son: A Memoir'', page 196. Beacon Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; GSAs made headlines in 1999 with the Federal Court ruling in ''Utah–East High Gay/Straight Alliance v. Board of Education of Salt Lake City School District''.&lt;ref&gt;(81 F. Supp.2d 1166, 1197 (D. Utah 1999))&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Jennifer Toomer-Cook |author2=Marjorie Cortez |title=3 groups sue S.L. board over club |url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/619419/3-groups-sue-SL-board-over-clubs.html |website=deseretnews.com |publisher=Deseret News |accessdate=20 January 2015 |date=19 March 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ruling found that denying access to a school-based gay–straight alliance was a violation of the Federal [[Equal Access Act]] giving students the right to use facilities for extra curricular activities at any school that receives public funding—regardless of private standing or religious affiliation.

On January 24, 2012, Secretary of Education, [[Arne Duncan]], released a video on [[YouTube]] commemorating ''GSA Day'' and endorsing GSA clubs in schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94NNqjxh58A |title=National Gay-Straight Alliance Day message from Secretary Arne Duncan |date=24 January 2012 |work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inclusivity ===
Approximately 28% of participants at GSA Network identify as [[heterosexual]].&lt;ref name="GSA FAQ" /&gt;

=== Opposition ===
Some students face opposition from school administrations, elected school boards, or local communities in starting a school GSA.

In 2015, students at Brandon High School in [[Rankin County, Mississippi]], attempted to start a GSA, but the school board met and publicly stated they wanted to prevent the formation of "gay clubs" in the school district. They then created a policy requiring parents to provide written permission before a student can join any club. Students then protested with support from the [[ACLU]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Proposed LGBT club prompts new Rankin school policy |url=http://www.clarionledger.com/story/news/local/2015/01/14/rankin-schools-gay-club-policy/21745481/ |website=The Clarion Ledger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Students at [[West Carteret High School]] in [[Morehead City, North Carolina]] tried to start a GSA but the Carteret County Board of Education turned it down.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} In 1999, the [[Orange Unified School District]] in [[Orange County, California]] moved to prohibit the formation of a GSA at [[El Modena High School]]. The students then sued the school board, claiming that their rights under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] and the 1984 [[Equal Access Act]] had been violated. In the first-ever ruling of its kind, Judge [[David O. Carter]] of the [[United States District Court for the Central District of California]] issued a preliminary injunction ordering the school to allow the GSA to meet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Colin ex rel. Colin v. Orange Unified School District |vol=83 |reporter=F. Supp. 2d |opinion=1135 |court=C.D. Cal. |date=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The right of students to establish a GSA at school is guaranteed by both the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]] (with regard to every level of schooling) and the federal [[Equal Access Act]] (with regard to secondary schools as long as other student clubs are allowed, with the definition of secondary school for purposes of the federal law including middle schools and high schools).
{{quote|author=[[GSA Network]]|text=''GSAs cannot be banned if other non-curricular student clubs are allowed to exist at the school. The Federal Equal Access Act and the First Amendment of the US Constitution establish the requirement of equal treatment for all non-curriculum related clubs regardless of the content of speech at the club meetings.''&lt;ref name="GSA FAQ" /&gt;}}

== History outside the United States ==

=== United Kingdom ===
Worldwide, gay–straight alliances are not as popular as they are in the United States but are beginning to take-off slowly. In the [[United Kingdom|UK]], there has always been more of an emphasis on stand alone lesbian and gay youth groups that take place outside of the school setting, often funded by the local health authority or education service. The first GSA in the UK was founded in 2000 by [[CN Lester]] at [[Putney High School]] GDST, and led in part to the formation of Queer Youth Network. The second GSA in the UK was started in 2010 at [[Shimna Integrated College]] in Northern Ireland. Another GSA started in 2012 by Copland Community school in Wembley.&lt;ref name=GraunGSA&gt;{{cite news |last1=Vasagar |first1=Jeevan |title=Gay-Straight Alliance club confronts homophobia at north London school |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/mar/02/gay-straight-alliance-homophobia-school |accessdate=16 August 2015 |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The setting up of the club has subsequently resulted in the school being known for "tackling homophobic prejudice".&lt;ref name=GraunGSA /&gt; Acland Burghley school in Camden set up a gay–straight alliance in 2012 called ''Connected''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/ConnectedLGBT |title=Connected: LGBTQ-Straight Alliance |work=Facebook}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mexico ===
The first GSA in Mexico was begun by a group of students in 2004 at the [[American School Foundation]], a private American school in Mexico City. The GSA was initially opposed by several school board members and a small group of religious conservative parents. But the students eventually won and formed the student club. The GSA's co-advisor, Ian K. Macgillivray, wrote  several articles detailing his students' experiences, as well as the book, ''Gay-Straight Alliances: A Handbook for Students, Educators, and Parents'' (2007, Harrington Park Press).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Macgillivray |first=Ian |title=Shaping Democratic Identities and Building Citizenship Skills Through Student Activism: Mexico's First Gay-Straight Alliance |journal=Equity &amp; Excellence in Education |year=2005 |volume=38 |issue=4 |pages=320–330 |doi=10.1080/10665680500299783}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Macgillivray |first=Ian |title=The Struggle for Mexico's First Gay-Straight Alliance: Como una Novela Real |journal=Journal of Gay &amp; Lesbian Issues in Education |year=2006 |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=33–46 |doi=10.1300/J367v04n01_04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canada ===
Beyond a school group the [[Toronto District School Board]] has been committed to an unwritten alliance with their students, funding the [[Triangle Program]] at OASIS Alternative School, designed for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender students who are at risk of dropping out or committing [[self-harm]] because of harassment in regular schools.

The first GSA in Canada was started at [[Pinetree Secondary School]] in Coquitlam, British Columbia in 1998. The start of the Pinetree GSA garnered national media attention, and its members continued to play a role in public affairs by meeting with successive provincial Ministers of Education, testifying before the B.C. Safe Schools Task Force on anti-bullying, and delivering workshops to students and educators about LGBT-sensitive inclusive language and how to start GSAs. In early 2002, the Pinetree GSA held the first Pride Day at a high school in Canada. The Pride Day included an information fair with booths from various local LGBT organizations, PrideTalk workshops delivered in numerous classes, and an assembly with a talk on transgender rights and a performance by G.L.A.S.S., a local LGBT youth choir.

In [[Saskatchewan]], Carlton Comprehensive High School houses one of the first GSA movements in the city of [[Prince Albert, Saskatchewan|Prince Albert]]. The first GSA in the city of [[Saskatoon]] first met on March 18, 2003 at [[Mount Royal Collegiate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library2.usask.ca/srsd/chronology/?year=2003 |title=Celebrating a History of Diversity: Lesbian and Gay Life in Saskatchewan, 1971–2006 |publisher=Library2.usask.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, GSAs have been established at Nutana, [[Walter Murray Collegiate Institute|Walter Murray]], [[Evan Hardy Collegiate|Evan Hardy]], [[Marion M. Graham Collegiate|Marion Graham]], [[Bedford Road Collegiate|Bedford Road]] and [[Aden Bowman Collegiate|Aden Bowman]] Collegiates. The city of North Battleford Saskatchewan, had their first GSA in 2004 at Sakewew High School, a [[First Nations]] school.

Parkside High School (Dundas, Ontario) held the first Gay–Straight-Alliance assembly in Canada, in 2011.

In [[Ontario]], Arnprior District High school, a small rural [[Ottawa Valley]] town started a GSA created by the students in 2009.

In May 2010 [[Egale Canada]] launched MyGSA.ca, a website focused on GSAs and their role in making Canadian schools safer and more LGBTQ inclusive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mygsa.ca |title=MyGSA |work=mygsa.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As part of MyGSA.ca's mission the site maintains an online directory of Canadian GSAs and provided resources and information to students who wish to start a GSA in their school and for teachers who wish to support them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mygsa.ca/GSADirectory/ |title=GSA Directory |publisher= |date= |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100524015047/http://mygsa.ca/GSADirectory |archivedate=May 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In December 2011, the government of the most populous Canadian province, Ontario, announced it would bring a legislation making it mandatory for all publicly funded schools to support the formation of "tolerance clubs" and student associations. Gay–straight clubs were to be specifically mentioned in that act. The main focus of that legislation would be to counterattack bullying of students, particularly those of a racial or sexual minority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2011/12/12/dalton-mcguinty-catholic-ontario-bullying-law_n_1143920.html?ref=canada-politics |title=Huffington Post; Dec.15,2011 |publisher=Huffingtonpost.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Bathurst, New Brunswick]], Students and teachers at [[Superior Middle School]] started their own GSA and it continues to run. It is a safe haven for many LGBT+ Students in the school.

=== Netherlands ===
The first GSAs in the Netherlands were started in 2009. At the beginning of 2011, a nationwide campaign was started on television to promote GSAs in Dutch schools, featuring several well-known young actors and singers. A number of GSAs already exist in a wide variety of Dutch schools throughout the country, most of them at the university level, but increasingly popular on secondary school level.

=== New Zealand ===

=== Australia ===
In Australia, the group Safe Schools Coalition Victoria piloted a system of reducing homophobia though teacher training and student groups that promote inclusion of LGBT young people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.safeschoolscoalition.org.au/who-we-are |title=Who we are |work=Safe Schools Coalition Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Started by [[The Foundation for Young Australians]] and Gay and Lesbian Health Victoria, along with La Trobe University, the program was expanded to run Australia wide. The program is supported by [[Beyondblue]], [[Headspace (organisation)|Headspace]], the [[University of Canberra]], [[Macquarie University]], [[University of Western Sydney]], [[Curtin University]], various family planning and HIV prevention groups, government bodies and Uniting Church organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.safeschoolscoalition.org.au/our-supporters/organisations |title=Supporter Organisations |work=Safe Schools Coalition Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hong Kong ===
In 2008, students at [[The University of Hong Kong]] founded Queer Straight Alliance (QSA), a registered society under Hong Kong laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://queerstraightalliance.wordpress.com |title=Queer Straight Alliance (QSA) |work=Queer Straight Alliance (QSA)}}&lt;/ref&gt; For several years it was the only GSA in the city, and it serves students in all campuses through social activities, career support and advocacy. In more recent years, university students in the city have formed other student LGBT groups. However, GSA efforts in secondary schools remain limited, if any.

=== Bulgaria ===
In 2016, [[Bulgaria]] became the first country in the [[Balkans]] to open a gay–straight alliance in [[American College of Sofia|Sofia American College]].

=== India ===
The first GSA in [[India]] was started in [[Tagore International School]] in New Delhi in 2014 by a group of students and their mentor Shivanee Sen who had formed a pro-LGBT group initiative known as 'Breaking Barriers' which was the first student-led campaign in India to address LGBTQI (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex) issues. This group was first inspired to care and focus on the lives of oppressed students and hijras, a community of transgender women, intersex individuals, and [[eunuchs]] in India who are marginalized both socially and economically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thebetterindia.com/86407/meet-co-founder-thrive-magazine-platform-lgbt-youth |title=Breaking Barriers, First GSA in India|}}&lt;/ref&gt;
At [[Presidency University, Kolkata]], around 100 students have formed a GSA group called Ardhek Akash, which also produces a magazine of the same name. In recent months the group has formed new chapters at [[Jadavpur University]] and [[St. Xavier's College]]—also in Calcutta—and is looking to expand further.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://gsanetwork.org/about-us/history |title=Ardhek Akash, GSA|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2599">'''Generally Accepted Privacy Principles''' (GAPP) is a framework intended to assist [[Chartered Accountants]] and [[Certified Public Accountants]] in creating an effective [[privacy]] program for managing and preventing privacy risks. The framework was developed through joint consultation between the [[Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants]] (CICA) and the [[American Institute of Certified Public Accountants]] (AICPA) through the AICPA/CICA Privacy Task Force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web 
| url = https://www.cippguide.org/2010/07/01/generally-accepted-privacy-principles-gapp/
| title = Generally Accepted Privacy Principles (GAPP) &lt;&lt; CIPP Guide
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GAPP framework was previously known as the AICPA/CICA Privacy Framework, and is founded on a single privacy principle: [[personally identifiable information]] must be collected, used, retained and disclosed in compliance with the commitments in the entity's privacy notice and with criteria set out in the GAPP issued by the AICPA/CICA. This privacy objective is supported by ten main principles and over seventy objectives, with associated measurable criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| title = Generally Accepted Privacy Principles (GAPP) &lt;&lt; CIPP Guide
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Privacy is defined in Generally Accepted Privacy Principles as "the rights and obligations of individuals and organizations with respect to the collection, use, retention, disclosure, and disposal of personal information."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32312">{{about|the classical approach to Green's functions|a modern discussion|fundamental solution}}
In [[mathematics]], a '''Green's function''' is the [[impulse response]] of an [[inhomogeneous ordinary differential equation|inhomogeneous]] linear [[differential equation]] defined on a domain, with specified initial conditions or boundary conditions.

Through the [[superposition principle]] for [[linear operator]] problems, the [[convolution]] of a Green's function with an arbitrary function {{math|''f'' (''x'')}} on that domain is the solution to the inhomogeneous differential equation for  {{math|''f'' (''x'')}}.
In other words, given a [[linear differential equation|linear ordinary differential equation]] (ODE), ''L''(solution) = source, one can first solve {{math|''L''(green) {{=}} ''δ&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, for each {{mvar|s}}, and realizing that, since the source is a sum of [[delta function]]s, the solution is a sum of Green's functions as well, by linearity of {{mvar|L}}.

Green's functions are named after the British [[mathematician]] [[George Green (mathematician)|George Green]], who first developed the concept in the 1830s. In the modern study of linear [[partial differential equation]]s, Green's functions are studied largely from the point of view of [[fundamental solution]]s instead.

Under [[Green's function (many-body theory)|many-body theory]], the term is also used in [[physics]], specifically in [[quantum field theory]], [[aerodynamics]], [[aeroacoustics]], [[electrodynamics]], [[seismology]] and [[statistical field theory]], to refer to various types of [[correlation function (quantum field theory)|correlation functions]], even those that do not fit the mathematical definition. In quantum field theory, Green's functions take the roles of [[propagator]]s.

==Definition and uses==
A Green's function, {{math|''G''(''x,s'')}}, of a [[linear differential operator]]  {{math|''L'' {{=}} ''L''(''x'')}} acting on [[distribution (mathematics)|distributions]] over a subset of the [[Euclidean space]] &lt;math&gt;\R^n&lt;/math&gt;, at a point  {{math|''s''}}, is any solution of
{{NumBlk|1=::|2=&lt;math&gt;LG(x,s)=\delta(s-x),&lt;/math&gt;|3=(1)|RawN=.}}
where  {{math|''δ''}} is the [[Dirac delta function]]. This property of a Green's function can be exploited to solve differential equations of the form
{{NumBlk|1=::|2=&lt;math&gt;Lu(x)=f(x).&lt;/math&gt;|3=(2)|RawN=.}}

If the [[kernel (linear operator)|kernel]] of  {{math|''L''}} is non-trivial, then the Green's function is not unique. However, in practice, some combination of [[symmetry]], [[boundary condition]]s and/or other externally imposed criteria will give a unique Green's function. 
Green's functions may be categorized, by the type of boundary conditions satisfied, by a [[Green's function number]].
Also, Green's functions in general are [[Distribution (mathematics)|distributions]], not necessarily [[Function (mathematics)|functions]] of a real variable.

Green's functions are also useful tools in solving [[wave equation]]s and [[diffusion equation]]s. In [[quantum mechanics]], the Green's function of the [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] is a key concept with important links to the concept of [[density of states]].

As a side note, the Green's function as used in physics is usually defined with the opposite sign, instead,  that is,
:&lt;math&gt;LG(x,s)=\delta(x-s).&lt;/math&gt;
This definition does not significantly change any of the properties of the Green's function.

If the operator is [[translation invariant]], that is, when  {{math|''L''}}   has [[constant coefficients]] with respect to  {{math|''x''}}, then the Green's function can be taken to be a [[convolution operator]], that is,
:&lt;math&gt;G(x,s)=G(x-s).&lt;/math&gt;

In this case, the Green's function is the same as the impulse response of [[LTI system theory|linear time-invariant system theory]].

==Motivation==
{{See also |Spectral theory}}
Loosely speaking, if such a function {{mvar|G}}  can be found for the operator {{mvar|L}}, then, if we multiply the equation (1) for the Green's function by {{math|''f'' (''s'')}}, and then integrate with respect to {{mvar|s}}, we obtain,
:&lt;math&gt;\int L G(x,s)f(s) \, ds = \int \delta(x-s)f(s) \, ds = f(x).&lt;/math&gt;

The right-hand side is now given by the equation (2) to be equal to {{math|''L'' ''u''(''x'')}}, thus
:&lt;math&gt;Lu(x)=\int LG(x,s) f(s) \, ds.&lt;/math&gt;

Because the operator &lt;math&gt;L = L(x)&lt;/math&gt; is linear and acts on the variable {{mvar|x}} alone (not on the variable of integration {{mvar|s}}), one may take the operator {{mvar|L}} outside of the integration on the right-hand side, yielding
:&lt;math&gt;Lu(x)=L\left(\int G(x,s) f(s) \,ds\right),&lt;/math&gt;
which suggests
{{NumBlk|1=::|2=&lt;math&gt;u(x)=\int G(x,s) f(s) \,ds.&lt;/math&gt;|3=(3)|RawN=.}}

Thus, one may obtain the function  {{math| ''u''(''x'')}}  through knowledge of the Green's function in equation (1) and the source term on the right-hand side in equation (2). This process relies upon the linearity of the operator {{mvar|L}}.

In other words, the solution of equation (2),  {{math| ''u''(''x'')}}, can be determined by the integration given in equation (3). Although {{math|''f'' (''x'')}}  is known, this integration cannot be performed unless {{mvar|G}} is also known. The problem now lies in finding the Green's function  {{mvar|G}}  that satisfies equation (1). For this reason, the Green's function is also sometimes called the [[fundamental solution]] associated to the operator  {{mvar|L}}.

Not every operator  {{mvar|L}} admits a Green's function. A Green's function can also be thought of as a [[Inverse function#Left and right inverses|right inverse]] of  {{mvar|L}}.  Aside from the difficulties of finding a Green's function for a particular operator, the integral in equation (3) may be quite difficult to evaluate. However the method gives a theoretically exact result.

This can be thought of as an expansion of  {{mvar|f}}  according to a [[Dirac delta function]] basis (projecting  {{mvar|f}} over {{math| ''δ''(''x−s'')}}); and a superposition of the solution on each [[Projection (mathematics)|projection]]. Such an integral equation is known as a [[Fredholm integral equation]], the study of which constitutes [[Fredholm theory]].

{{see also|Volterra integral equation}}

==Green's functions for solving inhomogeneous boundary value problems==
The primary use of Green's functions in mathematics is to solve non-homogeneous [[boundary value problem]]s.  In modern [[theoretical physics]], Green's functions are also usually used as [[propagator]]s in [[Feynman diagram]]s;  the term ''Green's function'' is often further used for any [[correlation function (quantum field theory)|correlation function]].

===Framework===
Let {{math|''L''}} be the [[Sturm–Liouville theory|Sturm–Liouville]] operator, a linear differential operator of the form
:&lt;math&gt;L=\dfrac{d}{dx}\left[p(x) \dfrac{d}{dx}\right]+q(x)&lt;/math&gt;
and let  {{math|''D''}} be the [[boundary condition]]s operator
:&lt;math&gt;Du= \begin{cases}
 \alpha_1 u'(0)+\beta_1 u(0) \\
 \alpha_2 u'(l)+\beta_2 u(l) ~.
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

Let  {{math|''f''(''x'')}} be a [[continuous function]] in [0, {{math|''l''}}].  Further suppose that the problem
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 Lu &amp;= f \\
 Du &amp;= 0
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
is regular, i.e., only the [[Trivial (mathematics)|trivial]] solution exists for the [[homogenization (mathematics)|homogeneous]] problem.

===Theorem===
There is one and only one solution  {{math|''u''(''x'')}} that satisfies
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
 Lu &amp; = f\\
 Du &amp; = 0,
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
and it is given by
:&lt;math&gt;u(x)=\int_0^\ell f(s) G(x,s) \, ds~,&lt;/math&gt;
where  {{math|''G''(''x'',''s'')}} is a Green's function satisfying the following conditions:
# &lt;math&gt;G(x,s)&lt;/math&gt; is continuous in &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;.
# For &lt;math&gt;x \ne s&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;L G(x, s)=0&lt;/math&gt;.
# For &lt;math&gt;s \ne 0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;D G(x, s)=0&lt;/math&gt;.
# [[Derivative]] "jump": &lt;math&gt;G'(s_{+0}, s)-G'(s_{-0}, s)=1 / p(s)&lt;/math&gt;.

{{See also|Green's function (many-body theory)|propagator}}Sometimes the Green's function can be split into a sum of two functions. One with the variable positive (+) and the other with the variable negative (-). These are the advanced and special Green's functions, and when the equation under study depends on time, one of the parts is [[causal]] and the other anti-causal. In these problems usually the causal part is the important one.

==Finding Green's functions==

===Units===
While it doesn't uniquely fix the form the Green's function will take, performing a [[dimensional analysis]] to find the units a Green's function must have is an important sanity check on any Green's function found through other means. A quick examination of the defining equation,
:&lt;math&gt; L G(x, s) = \delta(x - s), &lt;/math&gt;
shows that the units &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; depend not only on the units of &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; but also on the number and units of the space of which the position vectors &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; are elements. This leads to the relationship:
:&lt;math&gt; [[G]] = [[L]]^{-1} [[\mathrm{d} x]]^{-1}, &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;[[G]]&lt;/math&gt; is defined as, "the physical units of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;", and &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d} x&lt;/math&gt; is the [[volume element]] of the space (or [[spacetime]]).

For example, if &lt;math&gt;L = \partial_t^2&lt;/math&gt; and time is the only variable then: 
:&lt;math&gt;[[L]] = [[\mathrm{time}]]^{-2},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;[[\operatorname{d} x]]  = [[\mathrm{time}]],\ \mathrm{and}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;[[G]] = [[\mathrm{time}]].&lt;/math&gt;
If &lt;math&gt;L = \square = \frac{1}{c^2}\partial_t^2-\nabla^2&lt;/math&gt;, the [[d'Alembert operator]], and space has 3 dimensions then:
:&lt;math&gt;[[L]] = [[\mathrm{length}]]^{-2},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;[[\operatorname{d} x]] = [[\mathrm{time}]] [[\mathrm{length}]]^3,\ \mathrm{and}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;[[G]] = [[\mathrm{time}]]^{-1} [[\mathrm{length}]]^{-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Eigenvalue expansions===
If a [[differential operator]]  {{math|''L''}} admits a set of [[eigenvectors]]  {{math|''Ψ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x'')}} (i.e., a set of functions   {{math|''Ψ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and scalars {{math|''λ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} such that  {{math|''LΨ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}}  = {{math|''λ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;  Ψ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} ) that is complete, then it is possible to construct a Green's function from these eigenvectors and [[eigenvalues]].

"Complete" means that the set of functions { {{math|''Ψ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} } satisfies the following [[completeness relation]],
:&lt;math&gt;\delta(x-x')=\sum_{n=0}^\infty \Psi_n^\dagger(x) \Psi_n(x').&lt;/math&gt;

Then the following holds,

{{Equation box 1
|indent =:
|equation =  &lt;math&gt;G(x, x')=\sum_{n=0}^\infty \dfrac{\Psi_n^\dagger(x) \Psi_n(x')}{\lambda_n},&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding= 6
|border
|border colour = #0073CF
|bgcolor=#F9FFF7}}
where &lt;math&gt;\dagger&lt;/math&gt; represents complex conjugation.

Applying the operator  {{math|''L''}} to each side of this equation results in the completeness relation, which was assumed.

The general study of the Green's function written in the above form, and its relationship to the [[function space]]s formed by the eigenvectors, is known as [[Fredholm theory]].

There are several other methods for finding Green's functions, including the [[method of images]], [[separation of variables]], and [[Laplace transforms]] (Cole 2011).

===Combining Green's functions===
If the differential operator &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; can be factored as &lt;math&gt;L=L_1 L_2&lt;/math&gt; then the Green's function of &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; can be constructed from the Green's functions for &lt;math&gt;L_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;L_2&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt; G(x, s) = \int G_2(x, s_1)\, G_1(s_1, s) \operatorname{d} s_1. &lt;/math&gt;
The above identity follows immediately from taking &lt;math&gt;G(x, s)&lt;/math&gt; to be the representation of the right operator inverse of &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;, analogous to how for the [[Invertible matrix#Other properties|invertable linear operator]] &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;, defined by &lt;math&gt;C= (AB)^{-1} = B^{-1} A^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, is represented by its matrix elements &lt;math&gt;C_{i,j}&lt;/math&gt;.

A further identity follows for differential operators that are scalar polynomials of the derivative, &lt;math&gt;L = P_N(\partial_x)&lt;/math&gt;. The [[fundamental theorem of algebra]], combined with the fact that &lt;math&gt;\partial_x&lt;/math&gt; [[Commutative property|commutes with itself]], guarantees that the polynomial can be factored, putting &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; in the form:
:&lt;math&gt; L = \prod_{i=1}^N (\partial_x - z_i),
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;z_i&lt;/math&gt; are the zeros of &lt;math&gt;P_N(z)&lt;/math&gt;. Taking the [[Fourier transform]] of &lt;math&gt;L G(x, s) = \delta(x - s)&lt;/math&gt; with respect to both &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; gives:
:&lt;math&gt; \hat{G}(k_x, k_s) = \frac{\delta(k_x - k_s)}{\prod_{i=1}^N (ik_x - z_i)}. &lt;/math&gt;
The fraction can then be split into a sum using a [[Partial fraction decomposition]] before Fourier transforming back to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; space. This process yields identities that relate integrals of Green's functions and sums of the same. For example, if &lt;math&gt;L = (\partial_x + \gamma) (\partial_x + \alpha)^2&lt;/math&gt; then one form for its Green's function is:
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}G(x, s) &amp; = \frac{1}{(\alpha - \gamma)^2}\Theta(x-s) \operatorname{e}^{-\gamma(x-s)} - \frac{1}{(\alpha - \gamma)^2}\Theta(x-s) \operatorname{e}^{-\alpha(x-s)} + \frac{1}{\gamma-\alpha} \Theta(x - s) \, (x - s) \operatorname{e}^{-\alpha(x-s)} \\
&amp; = \int \Theta(x - s_1) (x - s_1) \operatorname{e}^{-\alpha(x-s_1)} \Theta(s_1 - s) \operatorname{e}^{-\gamma (s_1 - s)} \operatorname{d} s_1. \end{align}  &lt;/math&gt;
While the example presented is tractable analytically, it illustrates a process that works when the integral is not trivial (for example, when &lt;math&gt;\nabla^2&lt;/math&gt; is the operator in the polynomial).

===Table of Green's functions=== 
The following table gives an overview of Green's functions of frequently appearing differential operators, where &lt;math&gt;\textstyle r=\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \rho = \sqrt{x^2+y^2}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \Theta(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the  [[Heaviside step function]], &lt;math&gt;\textstyle J_\nu(z)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Bessel function]], &lt;math&gt;\textstyle I_\nu(z)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[modified Bessel function of the first kind]], and &lt;math&gt;\textstyle K_\nu(z)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Bessel function#Modified Bessel functions: I.CE.B1 .2C K.CE.B1|modified Bessel function of the second kind]].&lt;ref&gt;some examples taken from Schulz, Hermann: Physik mit Bleistift. Frankfurt am Main: Deutsch, 2001. {{ISBN|3-8171-1661-6}} (German)&lt;/ref&gt; Where time ({{math|''t''}}) appears in the first column, the advanced (causal) Green's function is listed.

==Green's functions for the Laplacian==
Green's functions for linear differential operators involving the [[Laplacian]] may be readily put to use using the second of [[Green's identities]].

To derive Green's theorem, begin with the [[divergence theorem]] (otherwise known as [[Gauss's theorem]]),
:&lt;math&gt;\int_V \nabla \cdot \vec A\ dV=\int_S \vec A \cdot d\hat\sigma ~.&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;\vec A=\phi\nabla\psi-\psi\nabla\phi&lt;/math&gt; and substitute into Gauss' law.

Compute &lt;math&gt;\nabla\cdot\vec A&lt;/math&gt; and apply the product rule for the ∇ operator,
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 \nabla\cdot\vec A &amp;=\nabla\cdot(\phi\nabla\psi \;-\; \psi\nabla\phi)\\
 &amp;=(\nabla\phi)\cdot(\nabla\psi) \;+\; \phi\nabla^2\psi \;-\; (\nabla\phi)\cdot(\nabla\psi) \;-\; \psi\nabla^2\phi\\
 &amp;=\phi\nabla^2\psi \;-\; \psi\nabla^2\phi ~.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Plugging this into the divergence theorem produces [[Green's theorem]],
:&lt;math&gt;\int_V (\phi\nabla^2\psi-\psi\nabla^2\phi) dV=\int_S (\phi\nabla\psi-\psi\nabla\phi)\cdot d\hat\sigma.&lt;/math&gt;

Suppose that the linear differential operator {{mvar|L}} is the [[Laplacian]], ∇², and that there is a Green's function {{mvar|G}} for the Laplacian. The defining property of the Green's function still holds,
:&lt;math&gt;L G(x,x')=\nabla^2 G(x,x')=\delta(x-x').&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;\psi=G&lt;/math&gt; in Green's second identity, see [[Green's identities]].  Then,
:&lt;math&gt;\int_V \left[ \phi(x') \delta(x-x')-G(x,x') {\nabla'}^2\phi(x')\right]\ d^3x' = \int_S \left[\phi(x')\nabla' G(x,x')-G(x,x')\nabla'\phi(x')\right] \cdot d\hat\sigma'.&lt;/math&gt;

Using this expression, it is possible to solve [[Laplace's equation]] ∇²''φ(x)'' = 0 or [[Poisson's equation]]  ∇²''φ(x)'' =−''ρ(x)'', subject to either [[Neumann boundary condition|Neumann]] or [[Dirichlet boundary condition|Dirichlet]] boundary conditions. In other words, we can solve for  ''φ(x)'' everywhere inside a volume where either (1) the value of ''φ(x)'' is specified on the bounding surface of the volume (Dirichlet boundary conditions), or (2) the normal derivative of ''φ(x)''  is specified on the bounding surface (Neumann boundary conditions).

Suppose the problem is to solve for ''φ(x)'' inside the region. Then the integral
:&lt;math&gt;\int\limits_V {\phi(x')\delta(x-x')\ d^3x'}&lt;/math&gt;
reduces to simply ''φ(x)'' due to the defining property of the [[Dirac delta function]] and we have
:&lt;math&gt;\phi(x)=-\int_V G(x,x') \rho(x')\ d^3x'+\int_S \left[\phi(x')\nabla' G(x,x')-G(x,x')\nabla'\phi(x')\right] \cdot d\hat\sigma'.&lt;/math&gt;

This form expresses the well-known property of [[harmonic function]]s, that ''if the value or normal derivative is known on a bounding surface, then the value of the function inside the volume is known everywhere''.

In [[electrostatics]],  ''φ(x)'' is interpreted as the [[electric potential]],  ''ρ(x)'' as [[electric charge]] [[density]], and the normal derivative &lt;math&gt;\nabla\phi(x')\cdot d\hat\sigma'&lt;/math&gt; as the normal component of the electric field.

If the problem is to solve a Dirichlet boundary value problem, the Green's function should be chosen such that ''G(x,x')''  vanishes when either ''x'' or ''x''′ is on the bounding surface. Thus only one of the two terms in the surface integral remains. If the problem is to solve a Neumann boundary value problem, the Green's function is chosen such that its normal derivative vanishes on the bounding surface, as it would seem to be the most logical choice. (See Jackson J.D. classical electrodynamics, page 39).  However, application of Gauss's theorem to the differential equation defining the Green's function yields
:&lt;math&gt;\int_S \nabla' G(x,x') \cdot d\hat\sigma' = \int_V \nabla'^2 G(x,x') d^3x' = \int_V \delta (x-x') d^3x' = 1   ~,&lt;/math&gt;
meaning the normal derivative of ''G(x,x')''  cannot vanish on the surface, because it must integrate to 1 on the surface.  (Again, see Jackson J.D. classical electrodynamics, page 39 for this and the following argument).

The simplest form the normal derivative can take is that of a constant, namely 1/''S'', where ''S'' is the surface area of the surface.  
The surface term in the solution becomes
:&lt;math&gt;\int_S \phi(x')\nabla' G(x,x')\cdot d\hat\sigma' = \langle\phi\rangle_S &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\langle\phi\rangle_S &lt;/math&gt; is the average value of the potential on the surface.  This number is not known in general, but is often unimportant, as the goal is often to obtain the electric field given by the gradient of the potential, rather than the potential itself.

With no boundary conditions, the Green's function for the Laplacian ([[Green's function for the three-variable Laplace equation]]) is
:&lt;math&gt;G(x,x')=-\dfrac{1}{4 \pi |x-x'|}.&lt;/math&gt;

Supposing that the bounding surface goes out to infinity and plugging in this expression for the Green's function  finally yields the standard expression for electric potential in terms of electric charge density as

{{Equation box 1

==Example==
&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Example.''' Find the Green function for the following problem, whose [[Green's function number]] is X11:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  Lu &amp; = u'' + k^2 u = f(x)\\
  u(0)&amp; = 0, \quad u\left(\tfrac{\pi}{2k}\right) = 0.
 \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''First step:''' The Green's function for the linear operator at hand is defined as the solution to

:&lt;math&gt;g''(x,s) + k^2 g(x,s) = \delta(x-s).&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;x\ne s&lt;/math&gt;, then the delta function gives zero, and the general solution is

:&lt;math&gt;g(x,s)=c_1 \cos kx+c_2 \sin kx.&lt;/math&gt;

For &lt;math&gt;x&lt;s&lt;/math&gt;, the boundary condition at &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt; implies

:&lt;math&gt;g(0,s)=c_1 \cdot 1+c_2 \cdot 0=0, \quad c_1 = 0&lt;/math&gt;

 if &lt;math&gt;x &lt; s&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s \ne \tfrac{\pi}{2k}&lt;/math&gt;.

For &lt;math&gt;x&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;, the boundary condition at &lt;math&gt;x=\tfrac{\pi}{2k}&lt;/math&gt; implies

:&lt;math&gt;g\left(\tfrac{\pi}{2k},s\right) = c_3 \cdot 0+c_4 \cdot 1=0, \quad c_4 = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

The equation of &lt;math&gt;g(0,s)=0&lt;/math&gt; is skipped for similar reasons.

To summarize the results thus far:

:&lt;math&gt;g(x,s)= \begin{cases}
  c_2 \sin kx, &amp; \text{for }x&lt;s\\
  c_3 \cos kx, &amp; \text{for }s&lt;x
 \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Second step:''' The next task is to determine &lt;math&gt;c_{2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c_{3}&lt;/math&gt;.

Ensuring continuity in the Green's function at &lt;math&gt;x=s&lt;/math&gt; implies

:&lt;math&gt;c_2 \sin ks=c_3 \cos ks&lt;/math&gt;

One can ensure proper discontinuity in the first derivative by integrating the defining differential equation from &lt;math&gt;x=s-\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;x=s+\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; and taking the limit as &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; goes to zero:

:&lt;math&gt;c_3 \cdot \left(-k \sin ks\right)-c_2 \cdot \left( k \cos ks\right )=1&lt;/math&gt;

The two (dis)continuity equations can be solved for &lt;math&gt;c_{2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c_{3}&lt;/math&gt; to obtain

: &lt;math&gt;c_2 = -\frac{\cos ks}{k}  \quad;\quad c_3 = -\frac{\sin ks}{k}&lt;/math&gt;

So the Green's function for this problem is:

:&lt;math&gt;g(x,s)=\begin{cases}
  -\frac{\cos ks}{k} \sin kx, &amp; x&lt;s\\
  -\frac{\sin ks}{k} \cos kx, &amp; s&lt;x
 \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

Then, the [[Heaviside step function]] {{mvar|H}}({{mvar|x}}−{{mvar|x}}&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) is a Green's function of  {{mvar|L}} at {{mvar|x}}&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.

Also, assume a [[Dirichlet boundary condition]] is imposed at  {{mvar|x}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 and a [[Neumann boundary condition]] is imposed at  {{mvar|y}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0. Then the X10Y20 Green's function is

::&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
G(x, y, x_0, y_0) =\dfrac{1}{2\pi} &amp;\left[\ln\sqrt{(x-x_0)^2+(y-y_0)^2}-\ln\sqrt{(x+x_0)^2+(y-y_0)^2} \right. \\
&amp;\left. + \ln\sqrt{(x-x_0)^2+(y+y_0)^2}- \ln\sqrt{(x+x_0)^2+(y+y_0)^2}\right]
\end{align}    ~.&lt;/math&gt;

* Let &lt;math&gt; a &lt; x &lt; b &lt;/math&gt;, and all three are elements of the real numbers. Then, for any function from reals to reals, &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;, with an &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; derivative that is integrable over the interval &lt;math&gt;[a, b]&lt;/math&gt;:

::&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
f(x) &amp; = \sum_{m=0}^{n-1} \frac{(x - a)^m}{m!} \left[ \frac{\operatorname{d}^m f}{\operatorname{d} x^m} \right]_{x=a} + \int_a^b \left[\frac{(x - s)^{n-1}}{(n-1)!} \Theta(x - s)\right] \left[ \frac{\operatorname{d}^n f}{\operatorname{d} x^n} \right]_{x=s} \operatorname{d}s 
\end{align} ~.&lt;/math&gt;

: The Green's function in the above equation, &lt;math&gt;G(x,s) = \frac{(x - s)^{n-1}}{(n-1)!} \Theta(x - s)&lt;/math&gt;, is not unique. How is the equation modified if &lt;math&gt;g(x-s)&lt;/math&gt; is added to &lt;math&gt;G(x,s)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;g(x)&lt;/math&gt; satisfies &lt;math&gt;\frac{\operatorname{d}^n g}{\operatorname{d} x^n} = 0&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x \in [a, b]&lt;/math&gt; (for example, &lt;math&gt;g(x) = -x/2&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;n=2&lt;/math&gt;)? Also, compare the above equation to the form of a [[Taylor series]] centered at &lt;math&gt;x=a&lt;/math&gt;.

'''''Growing Up in the Universe''''' was a series of lectures given by [[Richard Dawkins]] as part of the [[Royal Institution Christmas Lectures]], in which he discussed the [[evolution|evolution of life]] in the universe.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Dawkins]], ''[[Brief Candle in the Dark: My Life in Science]]'', [[Bantam Press]], 2015, chapter "Christmas Lectures", pages 105-117 ({{ISBN|978-0-59307-256-1}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

The lectures were first broadcast in 1991, in the form of five one-hour episodes, on the [[BBC]] in the United Kingdom. The [[Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science]] was granted the rights to the televised lectures, and a DVD version was released by the foundation on 20 April 2007.

Dawkins' book ''[[Climbing Mount Improbable]]'' developed from the ideas presented in the lectures, and the title itself is taken from the third lecture in the series.

==Parts==

===Part 1: Waking Up in the Universe===
To start off part one, Dawkins discusses the amazing capabilities of the [[human body]] and contrasts these with the limited capabilities of computers and other man-made machines. He uses a small [[totem pole]] (which is used in [[ancestor worship]]) to illustrate the importance of studying our ancestors to understand how we've evolved. To contrast ease of reproduction with the difficulty of becoming an ancestor, Dawkins uses the example of paper folding to explain [[exponential growth]]. Dawkins then tells the audience that exponential growth does not generally happen in the real world - natural factors come into play which control the population numbers, meaning that only an elite group of organisms will actually become distant ancestors. To be in this elite group, the organism must "have what it takes" to survive and pass on their genes to offspring.

The long chain of successful ancestors means that the probability of our existence is very small, and we are lucky to be alive. By turning down the lights and shining a small spotlight on a large ruler in front of him, Dawkins illustrates the darkness of the distant past and of the unknown future.

After expounding on how lucky we are to be alive, and urging us not to waste the precious time that we have, Dawkins brings up the usefulness of science in aiding our understanding of the universe. He mentions the reply that [[Michael Faraday]] gave to [[Sir Robert Peel]] when asked about the use of science. Faraday's response was "What is the use of a baby?" Dawkins explains that Faraday was either referring to the vast potential of a baby, or to the idea that there must be something more to life than growing up, working, getting old, and dying. There must be a point to it all; Perhaps science can uncover the answers to our biggest questions.

To shake off the "anesthetic of familiarity," Dawkins shows the audience a number of strange terrestrial organisms which he humorously nicknames "By-Jovians," playing off a term we might use to refer to living organisms from another planet, for instance Jupiter. He uses a [[scanning electron microscope]] to look at small organisms including mites, mosquitoes, and a bee being parasitized by a [[strepsiptera]]. Using a model of a [[eukaryotic]] cell, he discusses the [[mitochondria]] and presents the audience with a complicated diagram of the [[metabolic pathways]].

Dawkins suggests that we can also shake off the familiarity by stepping backwards in time. By using a single pace to represent going back 1000 years, he starts at year zero and takes four steps in front of his desk, going back to 4000 BCE. Pointing to a portrait of [[Homo habilis]], he states that to go back to the time of habilis, he would have to walk about two kilometers. He has audience members hold up portraits of other human ancestors, telling them how far he would have to walk to get back to the time of each one.

By imagining what an advanced alien species would think of humans if they were to arrive on Earth, Dawkins suggests that their science would be similar to ours. They would know about [[pi]], the [[Pythagorean theorem]], and the [[theory of relativity]]. However, Dawkins explains that the alien anthropologists would most likely scoff at our local, parochial religious beliefs. He then contrasts evidence-based beliefs with revealed, tradition-based, and authority-based beliefs.

To explain the problem with beliefs in the supernatural, Dawkins conducts a small experiment with the audience to "find the psychic." Using a coin, he assigns half the audience to will it to land on heads, and assigns the other half to will it to land on tails. After each flip, the section of the audience that was wrong is eliminated from the experiment, and he repeats the experiment using the remainder. After eight coin flips, only one boy in the audience remains. Dawkins then asks the question "Is he psychic?" Obviously, because of how the experiment was set up, one person was bound to have been correct about the result of each coin flip. Dawkins argues that this is exactly how seemingly supernatural events occur in the real world, especially when the "audience" is the entire population of the planet.

To conclude the lecture, Dawkins claims that there is nothing wrong with having faith in a proper scientific prediction. To illustrate this, he takes a cannonball which has been suspended from the ceiling with a rope, pulls it aside and touches it to his forehead. He announces that he is going to release the cannonball, letting it swing away from him, and that when it comes back to him, he is going to ignore his natural instinct to run because he has faith in his scientific prediction of what will happen - the cannonball should stop about an inch short of his forehead. He releases the cannonball, and his prediction is proved correct.

===Part 2: Designed and Designoid Objects===
Dawkins' second lecture of the series examines the problem of design. He presents the audience with a number of simple objects, such as [[rocks]] and [[crystals]], and notes that these objects have been formed by simple laws of physics and are therefore not designed. He then examines some designed objects - including a [[microscope]], an electronic [[calculator]], a [[pocket watch]],
and a clay pot - and notes that none of these objects could have possibly come about by sheer luck. Dawkins then discusses what he calls "designoid objects", which are complex objects that are neither simple, nor designed. Not only are they complex on the outside, they are also complex on the inside - perhaps billions of times more complex than a designed object such as a microscope.

Dawkins then shows the audience a number of designed and designoid objects, including the [[pitcher plant]], megalithic mounds built by the compass termite, and pots made by [[trapdoor spider]]s, [[potter wasp]]s, and [[mason bee]]s. He examines some designoid objects that use [[camouflage]], such as a [[grasshopper]] that looks like a stone, a [[sea horse]] that looks like sea weed, a [[leaf insect]], a green snake, a [[stick insect]], and a collection of [[butterflies]] that look like dead leaves when their wings are closed. Dawkins notes that many animals share similar types of camouflage or protection because of a process called [[convergent evolution]]. Examples of such designoid objects include the [[hedgehog]] and the [[spiny anteater]] (both of which evolved pointed spines along their back) and the [[marsupial wolf]] (which looks like a dog but is actually a marsupial). He illustrates the reason why convergent evolution occurs by using two small models of commercial aircraft. The reason they look similar isn't due to industrial espionage, it is due to the fact that they are both built to fly, so they must make use of similar design principles.

Using a camera and a model eye, Dawkins then compares the designed camera with the designoid eye. Both are involved in similar processes - using a lens to direct light onto a film or a retina. Both the camera and the eye also have an iris, which is used to control the amount of light which is allowed in. Using a volunteer from the audience, Dawkins demonstrates the contraction of the human
iris by shining a light into her right eye.

The lecture then moves into an explanation of [[natural selection]], which brings forth designoid objects. To explain natural selection, Dawkins first explains [[artificial selection]] by discussing the evolution of [[wild cabbage]] into [[broccoli]], [[cauliflower]], [[cabbage]], [[red cabbage]], [[kohlrabi]], and [[Brussels sprouts]]. He continues the discussion of artificial selection by explaining the evolution of the ancestral wolf into the many varieties of modern dog. Starting with the ancestral wolf, Dawkins imagines that everyone on one side of the room is breeding for small wolves, while everyone on the other side is breeding for big wolves. By selectively breeding the smallest or largest of each litter for a number of years, you may eventually end up with something like the [[Chihuahua (dog)|Chihuahua]] on one side of the room, and something like a [[Great Dane]] on the other side of the room.

Dawkins then introduces an Arthromorphs computer program (similar to the Biomorphs program&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phy.syr.edu/courses/mirror/biomorph/ Blind Watchmaker Applet]  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5wDmfapFG?url=http://www.phy.syr.edu/courses/mirror/biomorph/ |date=3 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;), explaining how it works while a volunteer uses the computer to selectively breed more and more generations.

At this point, Dawkins switches from explaining artificial selection to explaining natural selection. To demonstrate natural selection in a computer program, Dawkins uses a program written by Peter Fuchs to simulate the evolution of the [[spiderweb]]. The program builds "genetic" variations of a parent web, as if the web was actually being built by a child spider. For each generation, a simulation is run which randomly generates flies - some of which will hit the web, and others that will miss it. The child web that is able to capture the highest number of flies is selected as the parent for the next generation of webs. Dawkins shows the audience the "fossil record" that the program recorded after simulating a large number of generations overnight. The web starts off very simple and inefficient, but by the end it has evolved into a web that is highly efficient and highly complex. This is the same process that has led to the existence of all designoid objects.

Dawkins now discusses the most popular alternative to natural selection, which is known as [[creationism]]. He explains that creationists mistakenly believe designoid objects to be designed objects created by a divine being. Quoting from [[William Paley]]'s ''Natural Theology'', Dawkins discusses the [[argument from design]] using the example of the watch and the watchmaker. Even though designoid objects appear to be designed, [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] proved that this is not the case. Although Darwin's theory was discovered well after Paley developed his watchmaker argument, Dawkins explains that the argument of a divine watchmaker was still a bad argument, even in Paley's day. Paraphrasing [[David Hume]], Dawkins explains that anything capable of creating humans must itself be highly complicated. Thus, the argument from design actually explains nothing - "shooting itself in the foot." While it is true that designoid objects cannot come about by chance, evolution provides a non-random method of creation - namely, natural selection.

After developing the argument against a divine creator, Dawkins examines a number of designoid objects that contain imperfections, which is something you would not expect to find in an object that is supposedly created by a divine being. Showing the audience a [[halibut]] flatfish, he explains how they evolved from an upright swimming ancestor with one eye on each side of the head into a bottom-hugging flatfish with a distorted set of eyes on one side of the body. Dawkins claims that this is poorly designed, as any proper engineer would design an organism more like a [[Skate (fish)|skate]], which flattened out on its belly instead of on its side. This is an example of something you would expect from an evolved/designoid object, but not something you would expect from a created/designed object.

Using labeled building blocks, Dawkins shows the audience how designed objects came to be. He starts off by placing the simple block on the bottom, and explaining that you don't have to start with a complex being, but can start with a very simple foundation. If you have a simple foundation, you can place the next block on top - the designoid block. From this block, you can get complex organisms. Only after complex designoid objects come to be can you get the final building block of design (microscopes, clay pots, etc.).

===Part 3: Climbing Mount Improbable===

Dawkins starts the lecture coming in with a [[Stick Insect|stick insect]] on his hand. He describes with how many details such a being imitates its environment, its almost like a [[key (lock)|key]] that fits a [[Lock (security device)|lock]]. He then shows another insect, namely a [[Leaf Insect]], which basically looks exactly like a dead leaf. He gives some more examples for this amazing imitation of the surrounding, e.g. a [[Potoo]], which looks like a branch of tree and a [[thorn bug]], which gains protection by looking like a [[rose]] [[Thorns, spines, and prickles|thorn]].

He, once again, makes the point that you can compare these beings with a key, which they represent themselves, whereas nature is the lock. Professor Richard Dawkins then explains that a key has to fit a lock exactly, and demonstrates this with a model of a lock. He mentions that a key is something very improbable. However it is hard to measure the probability of such a key, therefore Dawkins takes a [[bicycle lock]] for illustration, where you can calculate how likely it is to open the lock, because there is a fixed number of dials with a fixed number of positions. In Dawkin's case we have 3 dials, with 6 positions each, so the probability that you open the lock by sheer luck is one in 216.

Dawkins then shows the mechanism of the lock with a big model: Each dial has to be in the correct position in order to open up the lock. The model is then adapted to demonstrate a staged or gradualist solution to finding the right combination to open the lock. The probability of unlocking the combination in three separate phases falls to one in eighteen.

In this illustration, Dawkins identifies the role of sub-stages in Darwinian evolution. It is to increase the efficiency of mutation without affecting the probability of evolutionary success. The single stage requires 216, while the series of sub-stages requires only 18 non-random mutations at 100% probability of evolutionary success. That is an efficiency factor of 12 for mutations due to sub-staging without any change in probability. Similar efficiencies are achieved with random mutation without any change in probability.

After addressing the claim by [[Fred Hoyle]] that probability alone could not produce the complexity of a typed text by Shakespeare, Dawkins introduces the notion of inherited improvements over a number of generations. Nature proceeds through small evolutionary steps,rather than large leaps. This idea is  illustrated by a model of the ascent of Mount Improbable, which provides the title for this lecture.

Dawkins then illustrates the difference between the reproduction of inanimate phenomena, such as fires spread through sparks, with the inter-generational transmission of DNA in living structures. The gradual evolutionary adaption of these organisms is demonstrated through the examples of the eye, varieties of wings and protective camouflage.

The example of the gradual emergence of the eye is first shown: starting with a simple light sensitive flat surface and demonstrating the evolutionary benefits of a cone shaped proto-eye for detecting shadows and shapes. Dawkins then relates this model to the simple pinhole eye structure of a [[nautilus]] [[mollusc]].

The benefit of wing structures is illustrated by way of body flattening behaviour in tree snakes, the web like skin of flying squirrels and similar adaptions to be found on flying lizards.

===Part 4: The Ultraviolet Garden===
{{Expand section|date=October 2007}}
Dawkins begins by relating the story of asking a little girl "what she thought flowers were 'for'." Her response is anthropocentric, that flowers are there for our benefit. Dawkins points out that many people throughout history have thought that the natural world existed for our benefit, with examples from Genesis and other literature. Author [[Douglas Adams]], who is sitting in the audience, is called to read a relevant passage from his novel ''[[The Restaurant at the End of the Universe]]''.

Dawkins then asks  his audience to put off the idea that the natural world exists for our benefit. He considers the question of flowers seen through the eyes of bees and other pollinators, and performs a series of demonstrations which use ultraviolet light to excite fluorescence in various substances.

===Part 5: The Genesis of Purpose===
{{Expand section|date=May 2011}}
Dawkins opens by talking how organisms “grow up” to understand the universe around them, which requires certain apparatus, such as a [[brain]]. But before brains can become large enough to model the universe they must develop from intermediate forms. Dawkins then discusses the [[Sphex|digger wasp]] and the set of experiments conducted by [[Nikolaas Tinbergen]] of how the digger wasp models the local geography around its nest. He then talks about the limitations of the digger wasps’ brain and concludes that only the human brain is sufficiently developed to model large-scale phenomena about the world. He then shows a [[MRI]] scan of a human brain (later revealed to be his own brain) and describes how an image develops from the eye onto the [[visual cortex]].

Dawkins discusses how the image on the [[retina]] is upside-down and in two dimensions but the overlapping images from each of the eyes are [[stereopsis|composited]] to form a three-dimensional model in the brain. He shows this by asking the audience to focus on him while holding their hand at eye level which causes them to see two images of their hand; one from each eye. He then describes how using his finger to wriggle his [[eyeball]] that the outside world appears to move because he is moving the image on his retina. However this does not happen when he voluntary rolls his eyes from side to side. This is due to the brain using the internal model to compensate for the relative change in position of images on the retina. Dawkins gets someone to wear a [[virtual reality]] headset and move around in a 3-D computer generated world and draws an analogy between the model of the universe developed in one’s head with the virtual reality universe developed in the [[computer]].

He then goes on the show that the brain uses models to describe the universe by looking at how the brain interprets various optical illusions, such as the [[hollow-face illusion]] using a rotating hollow mask of [[Charlie Chaplin]], the "impossible" geometry of a [[Penrose triangle]], the shifting interpretations of the [[Necker cube]] and the ability of humans to find [[pareidolia|faces in random shapes]].

Dawkins then begins to discuss the evolution of the human brain. He shows an animation of the increasing skull size from ''[[Australopithecus]]'' to ''[[Homo habilis]]'' to ''[[Homo erectus]]'' and then finally to modern day [[humans]].

The ability of a brain to run complex simulations is a powerful evolutionary advantage. Dawkins talks about how this ability to model future events by showing a painting suggesting a hypothetical situation in which a female ''Homo erectus'' uses a mental model of a tree fallen across a gorge as a possible solution to crossing the gorge. The group then burns a tree so that it would create a bridge over the gap. He goes on to describe how the complex modelling ability of the brain may have developed due to this imaginative simulation of various possible scenarios or by the development of [[language]], which would allow ideas to be passed from generation to generation, or by technology, which is an extension of human hands and eyes; or, indeed, if it is a combination of all three.

Dawkins concludes that purpose has arisen in the [[Universe]] due to human brains. The simulations developed in our brain allow us to develop intent and purpose; and over time our collective understanding of the Universe will improve as we continue to study and exchange ideas.

==Quotations==
{{cquote|Life makes the wonders of technology seem commonplace. So where does life come from? What is it? Why are we here? What are we for? What is the meaning of life? There's a conventional wisdom which says that science has nothing to say about such questions. Well, all I can say is that if science has nothing to say, it's certain that no other discipline can say anything at all. But in fact, science has a great deal to say about such questions. And that's what these five lectures are going to be about. Life "grows up" in the universe by gradual degrees - evolution - and we grow up in our understanding of our origins and our meaning.}}

{{cquote|The present century is a tiny spotlight, inching its way along a gigantic ruler of time. Everything before the spotlight is the darkness of the dead past. Everything after the spotlight is in the darkness of the unknown future. We live in the spotlight. Of all the 200,000,000 centuries along the ruler of time, 199,999,999 centuries are in darkness. Only one is lit up, and that is the one in which we happen - by sheer luck - to be alive. The odds against our century happening to be the present century are the same as the odds against a penny tossed out at random on the road from London to Istanbul happening to fall on a particular ant.}}

{{cquote|We do of course, have an ordinary life to get on with. We do have a living to earn. We've got to earn our living being a solicitor or a lavatory cleaner or something like that. But nevertheless, it is worthwhile also from time to time shaking off the anaesthetic of familiarity and awakening to the wonder that is really all around us all the time.}}

{{cquote|Natural selection - nature - is constantly choosing which individual shall live, [and] which individual shall breed. And the result, after many generations of natural selection, is much the same as the result after many generations of artificial selection.}}

{{cquote|In any case, all creation, all design, all machines and houses and paintings and computers and airplanes, everything designed and made by us, everything made by other creatures, is only made possible because there are already brains put together as designoid objects - and designoid objects come about only through gradual evolution. Creation, when it does occur in the universe, is an afterthought. When creation appeared on this planet it came locally, and it came late. Creation does not belong in any account of the fundamentals of the universe. Creation is something that, rather late in the day, grows up in the universe.}}

'''Hazing in the [[Republic of Korea Armed Forces]]''' refers to [[hazing]] and [[bullying]] carried out within the military, often to conscripts and junior members. A similar example is that of Russia's [[Dedovshchina]]. Hazing was enforced mainly under the pretext of establishing military discipline, despite evidence that it did not achieve that goal. Hazing resulted in cases of [[fragging]] and [[suicide]], which are referred to as non-combat casualties.&lt;ref&gt;박휘락. (2014). 한국군의 악성 병영사고 예방책들의 평가와 대안. 한국의회학회보, 3(1), 155–177. Park, Hwee Rhak.

{{Hedonism}}
'''Hedonism''' is a school of thought that argues that the pursuit of [[pleasure]] and [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic goods]] are the primary or most important goals of human life.&lt;ref name="stanford"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hedonism/ |title=Hedonism |website=stanford.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; A hedonist strives to maximize net pleasure (pleasure minus [[pain]]). However upon finally gaining said pleasure, happiness may remain stationary.

Ethical hedonism is the idea that all people have the right to do everything in their power to achieve the greatest amount of pleasure possible to them.  It is also the idea that every person's pleasure should far surpass their amount of pain. Ethical hedonism is said to have been started by [[Aristippus]] of Cyrene, a student of [[Socrates]]. He held the idea that pleasure is the highest good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics|page=567|volume=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology and lexicon==
The name derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word for "delight" ({{lang|grc|ἡδονισμός}} ''hēdonismos'' from {{lang|grc|ἡδονή}} ''[[hedone|hēdonē]]'' "pleasure", cognate via [[Proto-Indo-European]] swéh₂dus through [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἡδύς}} with English ''sweet'' + suffix -ισμός ''-ismos'' "[[-ism|ism]]"). An extremely strong aversion to hedonism is [[hedonophobia]].

==History of development==

===Sumerian civilization===
In the original Old Babylonian version of the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]], which was written soon after the invention of writing, [[Siduri]] gave the following advice: "Fill your belly. Day and night make merry. Let days be full of joy. Dance and make music day and night [...] These things alone are the concern of men." This may represent the first recorded advocacy of a hedonistic [[philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Дробович |first=Антон |title=Вчення про насолоди і задоволення: від історії значень до концептуалізації понять | publisher=Практична філософія |pages=184–185|year=2012|volume=№2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient Egypt===
Scenes of a harper entertaining guests at a feast were common in [[ancient Egypt]]ian tombs (see [[Harper's Songs]]), and sometimes contained hedonistic elements, calling guests to submit to pleasure because they cannot be sure that they will be rewarded for good with a blissful afterlife. The following is a song attributed to the reign of one of the pharaohs around the time of the 12th dynasty, and the text was used in the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|eighteenth]] and [[Nineteenth dynasty of Egypt|nineteenth]] dynasties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wilson |first=John A. | title=Ancient Near Eastern Texts Relating to the Old Testament | publisher=Princeton University Press | chapter=Egyptian Secular Songs and Poems | authorlink=John A. Wilson (Egyptologist) | year=1969 | location=New Jersey | page=467}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Дробович |first=Антон |title=Вчення про насолоди і задоволення: від історії значень до концептуалізації понять | publisher=Практична філософія |page=185|year=2012|volume=№2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;Let thy desire flourish, 
In order to let thy heart forget the [[Ancient Egyptian burial customs|beatifications]] for thee.
Follow thy desire, as long as thou shalt live.
Put [[myrrh]] upon thy head and clothing of fine linen upon thee,
Being anointed with genuine marvels of the gods' property.
Set an increase to thy good things;
Let not thy heart flag.
Follow thy desire and thy good.
Fulfill thy needs upon earth, after the command of thy heart,
Until there come for thee that day of mourning.&lt;/poem&gt;}}

===Classic schools of antiquity===
[[Democritus]] seems to be the earliest philosopher on record to have categorically embraced a hedonistic philosophy; he called the supreme goal of life "contentment" or "cheerfulness", claiming that "joy and sorrow are the distinguishing mark of things beneficial and harmful" ([[Diels-Kranz|DK]] 68 B 188).&lt;ref&gt;p. 125, C.C.W. Taylor, "Democritus", in C. Rowe &amp; M. Schofield (eds.), ''Greek and Roman Political Thought'', Cambridge 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cyrenaic school ====
{{main article|Cyrenaics}}
[[File:Aristippus.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;[[Aristippus of Cyrene]]&lt;/center&gt;]]

The Cyrenaics were an ultra-hedonist Greek school of philosophy founded in the 4th century BC, supposedly by [[Aristippus of Cyrene]], although many of the principles of the school are believed to have been formalized by his grandson of the same name, [[Aristippus the Younger]]. The school was so called after [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]], the birthplace of Aristippus. It was one of the earliest [[Socrates|Socratic]] schools. The Cyrenaics taught that the only intrinsic good is pleasure, which meant not just the absence of pain, but positively enjoyable momentary sensations. Of these, physical ones are stronger than those of anticipation or memory. They did, however, recognize the value of social obligation, and that pleasure could be gained from [[altruism]]{{Citation needed|reason=by whom?|date=March 2011}}. [[Theodorus the Atheist]] was a latter exponent of hedonism who was a disciple of [[Aristippus the Younger|younger Aristippus]],&lt;ref name="diog86"&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, ii. 86&lt;/ref&gt; while becoming well known for expounding [[atheism]]. The school died out within a century, and was replaced by [[Epicureanism]].

The Cyrenaics were known for their skeptical [[Epistemology|theory of knowledge]]. They reduced logic to a basic doctrine concerning the criterion of truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reale|Catan|1986|p=274}}&lt;/ref&gt; They thought that we can know with certainty our immediate [[Empirical evidence|sense-experiences]] (for instance, that I am having a sweet sensation now) but can know nothing about the nature of the objects that cause these sensations (for instance, that the honey is sweet).&lt;ref name="copleston121"&gt;{{Harvnb|Copleston|2003|p=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also denied that we can have knowledge of what the experiences of other people are like.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reale|Catan|1986|pp=274–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; All knowledge is immediate sensation. These sensations are motions which are purely subjective, and are painful, indifferent or pleasant, according as they are violent, tranquil or gentle.&lt;ref name="copleston121"/&gt;&lt;ref name="annas230"&gt;{{Harvnb|Annas|1995|p=230}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, they are entirely individual and can in no way be described as constituting absolute objective knowledge. Feeling, therefore, is the only possible criterion of knowledge and of conduct.&lt;ref name="copleston121"/&gt; Our ways of being affected are alone knowable. Thus the sole aim for everyone should be pleasure.

Cyrenaicism deduces a single, universal aim for all people which is pleasure. Furthermore, all feeling is momentary and homogeneous. It follows that past and future pleasure have no real existence for us, and that among present pleasures there is no distinction of kind.&lt;ref name="annas230"/&gt; Socrates had spoken of the higher pleasures of the intellect; the Cyrenaics denied the validity of this distinction and said that bodily pleasures, being more simple and more intense, were preferable.&lt;ref name="annas231"&gt;{{Harvnb|Annas|1995|p=231}}&lt;/ref&gt; Momentary pleasure, preferably of a physical kind, is the only good for humans. However some actions which give immediate pleasure can create more than their equivalent of pain. The wise person should be in control of pleasures rather than be enslaved to them, otherwise pain will result, and this requires judgement to evaluate the different pleasures of life.&lt;ref name="copleston122"&gt;{{Harvnb|Copleston|2003|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regard should be paid to law and custom, because even though these things have no intrinsic value on their own, violating them will lead to unpleasant penalties being imposed by others.&lt;ref name="annas231"/&gt; Likewise, friendship and justice are useful because of the pleasure they provide.&lt;ref name="annas231"/&gt; Thus the Cyrenaics believed in the hedonistic value of social obligation and altruistic behaviour.

==== Epicureanism ====
{{main article|Epicureanism|Epicurus}}
Epicureanism is a system of [[philosophy]] based upon the teachings of [[Epicurus]] (''c''. 341–''c''. 270 BC), founded around 307 BC. Epicurus was an [[atomism|atomic]] [[materialism|materialist]], following in the steps of [[Democritus]] and [[Leucippus]]. His [[materialism]] led him to a general stance against superstition or the idea of divine intervention. Following [[Aristippus]]—about whom very little is known—Epicurus believed that the greatest good was to seek modest, sustainable "pleasure" in the form of a state of tranquility and freedom from fear  ([[ataraxia]]) and absence of bodily pain ([[aponia]]) through knowledge of the workings of the world and the limits of our desires. The combination of these two states is supposed to constitute happiness in its highest form. Although Epicureanism is a form of hedonism, insofar as it declares pleasure as the sole intrinsic good, its conception of absence of pain as the greatest pleasure and its advocacy of a simple life make it different from "hedonism" as it is commonly understood.

[[Image:Epicurus bust2.jpg|thumb|left|&lt;center&gt;[[Epicurus]]&lt;/center&gt;]]In the Epicurean view, the highest pleasure (tranquility and freedom from fear) was obtained by knowledge, friendship and living a virtuous and temperate life. He lauded the enjoyment of simple pleasures, by which he meant abstaining from bodily desires, such as sex and appetites, verging on [[asceticism]]. He argued that when eating, one should not eat too richly, for it could lead to dissatisfaction later, such as the grim realization that one could not afford such delicacies in the future. Likewise, sex could lead to increased lust and dissatisfaction with the sexual partner. Epicurus did not articulate a broad system of social ethics that has survived but had a unique version of the [[Golden Rule]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is impossible to live a pleasant life without living wisely and well and justly (agreeing "neither to harm nor be harmed"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Tim |last=O'Keefe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ugI3eRmNJrcC&amp;printsec=frontcover|title=Epicurus on Freedom|publisher= Cambridge University Press|year= 2005|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is impossible to live wisely and well and justly without living a pleasant life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://classics.mit.edu/Epicurus/princdoc.html ''Epicurus Principal Doctrines''] tranls. by Robert Drew Hicks (1925)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Epicureanism was originally a challenge to [[Platonism]], though later it became the main opponent of [[Stoicism]]. Epicurus and his followers shunned politics. After the death of Epicurus, his school was headed by [[Hermarchus]]; later many Epicurean societies flourished in the Late Hellenistic era and during the Roman era (such as those in [[Antioch]]ia, [[Alexandria]], [[Rhodes]] and [[Ercolano]]). The poet [[Lucretius]] is its most known Roman proponent. By the end of the Roman Empire, having undergone Christian attack and repression, Epicureanism had all but died out, and would be resurrected in the 17th century by the atomist [[Pierre Gassendi]], who adapted it to the Christian doctrine.

Some writings by Epicurus have survived. Some scholars consider the epic poem ''[[On the Nature of Things]]'' by [[Lucretius]] to present in one unified work the core arguments and theories of Epicureanism. Many of the papyrus scrolls unearthed at the [[Villa of the Papyri]] at [[Herculaneum]] are Epicurean texts. At least some are thought to have belonged to the Epicurean [[Philodemus]].

===Yangism===
{{main article|Yangism}}
Yangism has been described as a form of psychological and ethical egoism. The Yangist philosophers believed in the importance of maintaining self-interest through "keeping one's nature intact, protecting one's uniqueness, and not letting the body be tied by other things." Disagreeing with the Confucian virtues of li (propriety), ren (humaneness), and yi (righteousness) and the Legalist virtue of fa (law), the Yangists saw wei wo, or "everything for myself," as the only virtue necessary for self-cultivation. Individual pleasure is considered desirable, like in hedonism, but not at the expense of the health of the individual. The Yangists saw individual well-being as the prime purpose of life, and considered anything that hindered that well-being immoral and unnecessary.

The main focus of the Yangists was on the concept of xing, or human nature, a term later incorporated by Mencius into Confucianism. The xing, according to sinologist A. C. Graham, is a person's "proper course of development" in life. Individuals can only rationally care for their own xing, and should not naively have to support the xing of other people, even if it means opposing the emperor. In this sense, Yangism is a "direct attack" on Confucianism, by implying that the power of the emperor, defended in Confucianism, is baseless and destructive, and that state intervention is morally flawed.

The Confucian philosopher Mencius depicts Yangism as the direct opposite of Mohism, while Mohism promotes the idea of universal love and impartial caring, the Yangists acted only "for themselves," rejecting the altruism of Mohism. He criticized the Yangists as selfish, ignoring the duty of serving the public and caring only for personal concerns. Mencius saw Confucianism as the "Middle Way" between Mohism and Yangism.

=== Judaism ===

[[Judaism]] believes that mankind was created for pleasure, as [[God]] placed [[Adam and Eve]] in the [[Garden of Eden]]—Eden being the Hebrew word for "pleasure." In recent years, Rabbi [[Noah Weinberg]] articulated five different [http://www.aish.com/sp/f/Five_Levels_of_Pleasure.html levels of pleasure]; connecting with God is the highest possible pleasure. The Book of Ecclesiastes in the Old Testament proclaims, "There is nothing better for a person than that he should eat and drink and find enjoyment in his toil. This also, I saw, is from the hand of God..." (Ecclesiastes 2:24)

=== Christianity ===
{{main article|Christian hedonism}}
Ethical hedonism as part of [[Christian theology]] has also been a concept in some [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] circles, particularly in those of the [[Reformed theology|Reformed]] tradition.&lt;ref name="desiringgod1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.desiringgod.org/ResourceLibrary/TopicIndex/85_Christian_Hedonism/1538_Christian_Hedonism/|title=Christian Hedonism|website=Desiring God}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term [[Christian Hedonism]] was first coined by [[Reformed Baptists|Reformed Baptist]] theologian [[John Piper (theologian)|John Piper]] in his 1986 book ''Desiring God'': “My shortest summary of it is: God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in him. Or: The chief end of man is to glorify God by enjoying him forever. Does Christian Hedonism make a god out of pleasure? No. It says that we all make a god out of what we take most pleasure in.” &lt;ref name="desiringgod1"/&gt;  Piper states his term may describe the theology of [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]], who in 1812 referred to “a future enjoyment of him [God] in heaven.”&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Edwards, ''A treatise concerning religious affections'' (Dublin: J. Ogle, 1812)[https://books.google.com/books?id=99cHAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=titlepage&amp;source=gbs_v2_summary_r&amp;cad=0(accessed on Google Book on July 26, 2009)]&lt;/ref&gt; Already in the 17th century, the atomist [[Pierre Gassendi]] had adapted Epicureanism to the Christian doctrine.

===Hinduism===

The concept of hedonism is also found in [[Nastika]] (heterodox) philosophy such as the [[Charvaka]] school. However, Hedonism is critcized by [[Astika]]  (orthodox) schools of thought on the basis that it is inherently egoistic and therefore detrimental to spiritual liberation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Companion Encyclopaedia of Hindu Philosophy: An Exposition of the Principle [sic] Religio-philosophical Systems and an Examination of Different Schools of Thought|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JZWdEymxyp4C&amp;pg=PA252&amp;dq=hinduism+vedas+Hedonism#v=onepage&amp;q=hinduism%20vedas%20Hedonism&amp;f=false|page=252|publisher=Genesis Publishing Pvt Ltd|isbn=9788177552034|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Hinduism|page=464|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Utilitarianism===
{{main article|Utilitarianism}}
Utilitarianism addresses problems with moral motivation neglected by [[Kantianism]] by giving a central role to happiness. It is an ethical theory holding that the proper course of action is the one that maximizes the overall good of the society.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;, Salters-Nuffield Advanced Biology for Edexcel A2 Biology 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; It is thus one form of [[consequentialism]], meaning that the moral worth of an [[action (philosophy)|action]] is determined by its resulting outcome. The most influential contributors to this theory are considered to be the 18th and 19th-century British philosophers [[Jeremy Bentham]] and [[John Stuart Mill]]. Conjoining hedonism—as a view as to what is good for people—to utilitarianism has the result that all action should be directed toward achieving the greatest total amount of happiness (see [[Hedonic calculus]]). Though consistent in their pursuit of happiness, Bentham and Mill's versions of hedonism differ. There are two somewhat basic schools of thought on hedonism:&lt;ref name="stanford"/&gt;

* One school, grouped around Bentham, defends a quantitative approach. Bentham believed that the value of a pleasure could be quantitatively understood. Essentially, he believed the value of pleasure to be its intensity multiplied by its duration - so it was not just the number of pleasures, but their intensity and how long they lasted that must be taken into account.
* Other proponents, like Mill, argue a qualitative approach. Mill believed that there can be different levels of pleasure - higher quality pleasure is better than lower quality pleasure. Mill also argues that simpler beings (he often refers to pigs) have an easier access to the simpler pleasures; since they do not see other aspects of life, they can simply indulge in their lower pleasures. The more elaborate beings tend to spend more thought on other matters and hence lessen the time for simple pleasure. It is therefore more difficult for them to indulge in such "simple pleasures" in the same manner.
=== Libertinage ===
{{main article|Libertine}}
An extreme form of hedonism that views moral and sexual restraint as either unnecessary or harmful. Famous proponents are [[Marquis de sade]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/who-was-marquis-de-sade-180953980/|title=Who Was the Marquis de Sade?|first=Tony|last=Perrottet|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20141006-marquis-de-sade-still-shocking|title=Who’s afraid of the Marquis de Sade?|first=Jason|last=Farago|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John Wilmot]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://virginia-anthology.org/drama/rochester/?print=print|title=John Wilmot, the Earl of Rochester - The Open Anthology of Literature in English|website=virginia-anthology.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
=== Contemporary approaches ===
Contemporary proponents of hedonism include [[Sweden|Swedish]] philosopher [[Torbjörn Tännsjö]],&lt;ref&gt;Torbjörn Tännsjö; ''Hedonistic Utilitarianism''. Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press (1998).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fred Feldman (philosopher)|Fred Feldman]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Fred Feldman (philosopher)|Fred Feldman]](2006). ''Pleasure and the Good Life: Concerning the Nature, Varieties, and Plausibility of Hedonism.'' Oxford University Press and (1997). ''Utilitarianism, Hedonism, and Desert: Essays in Moral Philosophy. Cambridge University Press''&lt;/ref&gt; and Spanish ethic philosopher [[Esperanza Guisán]] (published a "Hedonist manifesto" in 1990).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Manifiesto_hedonista.html?id=75OJV9DAGegC|title=Manifiesto hedonista|website=google.com|isbn=9788476582213|last1=Guisán|first1=Esperanza|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A dedicated contemporary hedonist philosopher and writer on the history of hedonistic thought is the French [[Michel Onfray]]. He has written two books directly on the subject (''L'invention du plaisir : fragments cyréaniques''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=L'invention du plaisir. : Fragments cyrénaïques Le Livre de Poche Biblio: Amazon.es: Michel Onfray: Libros en idiomas extranjeros|work=amazon.es|id= {{ASIN|2253943231|country=es}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''La puissance d'exister : Manifeste hédoniste'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/2290054526/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_dp_ss_2?pf_rd_p=479289967&amp;pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe&amp;pf_rd_t=201&amp;pf_rd_i=2253083976&amp;pf_rd_m=A1X6FK5RDHNB96&amp;pf_rd_r=055JCMT72GK8V673HPSR|title=Manifeste hédoniste: Amazon.fr: Michel Onfray: Livres|website=amazon.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; He defines hedonism "as an introspective attitude to life based on taking pleasure yourself and pleasuring others, without harming yourself or anyone else."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newhumanist.org.uk/1421|title=Atheism à la mode|website=newhumanist.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Onfray's philosophical project is to define an ethical hedonism, a joyous [[utilitarianism]], and a generalized [[aesthetic]] of sensual [[materialism]] that explores how to use the brain's and the body's capacities to their fullest extent -- while restoring philosophy to a useful role in art, politics, and everyday life and decisions."&lt;ref name="wpunj.edu"&gt;[http://www.wpunj.edu/newpol/issue40/Ireland40.htm Introductory Note to Onfray by Doug Ireland] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090427113134/http://www.wpunj.edu/newpol/issue40/Ireland40.htm |date=27 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Onfray's works "have explored the philosophical resonances and components of (and challenges to) science, painting, gastronomy, sex and sensuality, bioethics, wine, and writing. His most ambitious project is his projected six-volume Counter-history of Philosophy,"&lt;ref name="wpunj.edu"/&gt; of which three have been published. For him "In opposition to the ascetic ideal advocated by the dominant school of thought, hedonism suggests identifying the highest good with your own pleasure and that of others; the one must never be indulged at the expense of sacrificing the other. Obtaining this balance – my pleasure at the same time as the pleasure of others – presumes that we approach the subject from different angles – political, ethical, aesthetic, erotic, bioethical, pedagogical, historiographical…."

For this he has "written books on each of these facets of the same world view."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=39991&amp;URL_DO=DO_PRINTPAGE&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html|title=Archives from 1948 - United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=unesco.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; His philosophy aims for "micro-revolutions", or "revolutions of the individual and small groups of like-minded people who live by his hedonistic, libertarian values."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ainfos.ca/06/dec/ainfos00234.html|title=A-Infos (en) France, Media, Michel Onfray, A self labeled Anarchist Philosoph|website=ainfos.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Abolitionism ====
{{main article|David Pearce (philosopher)}}
[[File:David Pearce (transhumanist).jpg|thumb|David Pearce, transhumanist philosopher]]
The [[Abolitionist Society]] is a [[transhumanism|transhumanist]] group calling for the abolition of [[suffering]] in all sentient life through the use of advanced [[biotechnology]]. Their core philosophy is [[negative utilitarianism]]. [[David Pearce (philosopher)|David Pearce]] is a theorist of this perspective and he believes and promotes the idea that there exists a strong ethical imperative for humans to work towards the abolition of [[suffering]] in all [[Sentience|sentient]] life. His book-length internet manifesto ''The Hedonistic Imperative''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Hedonistic Imperative|url=http://www.hedweb.com/hedethic/tabconhi.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; outlines how [[technology|technologies]] such as [[genetic engineering]], [[nanotechnology]], [[pharmacology]], and [[neurosurgery]] could potentially [[technological convergence|converge]] to eliminate all forms of unpleasant experience among human and non-human animals, replacing suffering with gradients of well-being, a project he refers to as  "[[paradise engineering]]".&lt;ref name="bodhissatva"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Genomic Bodhisattva |publisher=H+ Magazine |date=2009-09-16 |url=http://hplusmagazine.com/2009/09/16/genomic-bodhisattva/ |accessdate=2011-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[transhumanist]] and a [[vegan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year=2011 |title=Criação animal intensiva. Um outro Holocausto? |publisher=Revista do Instituto Humanitas Unisinos|url=http://www.ihuonline.unisinos.br/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3811&amp;secao=359 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pearce believes that we (or our future posthuman descendants) have a responsibility not only to avoid [[cruelty to animals]] within human society but also to alleviate the suffering of animals in the wild.

In a talk David Pearce gave at the [[Future of Humanity Institute]] and at the [[Charity International]] 'Happiness Conference' he said "Sadly, what ''won't'' abolish suffering, or at least not on its own, is socio-economic reform, or exponential economic growth, or technological progress in the usual sense, or any of the traditional panaceas for solving the world's ills. Improving the external environment is admirable and important; but such improvement can't recalibrate our hedonic treadmill above a genetically constrained ceiling. Twin studies confirm there is a [partially] heritable set-point of well-being - or ill-being - around which we all tend to fluctuate over the course of a lifetime. This set-point varies between individuals. [It's possible to ''lower'' an individual's hedonic set-point by inflicting prolonged uncontrolled stress; but even this re-set is not as easy as it sounds: suicide-rates typically go down in wartime; and six months after a quadriplegia-inducing accident, studies{{Citation needed|reason=Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence|date=November 2016}} suggest that we are typically neither more nor less unhappy than we were before the catastrophic event.] Unfortunately, attempts to build an ideal society can't overcome this biological ceiling, whether utopias of the left or right, free-market or socialist, religious or secular, futuristic high-tech or simply cultivating one's garden. Even if ''everything'' that traditional futurists have asked for is delivered - eternal youth, unlimited material wealth, morphological freedom, superintelligence, immersive VR, molecular nanotechnology, etc - there is no evidence that our subjective quality of life would on average significantly surpass the quality of life of our hunter-gatherer ancestors - or a New Guinea tribesman today - in the absence of reward pathway enrichment. This claim is difficult to prove in the absence of sophisticated neuroscanning; but objective indices of psychological distress e.g. suicide rates, bear it out. ''Un''enhanced humans will still be prey to the spectrum of Darwinian emotions, ranging from terrible suffering to petty disappointments and frustrations - sadness, anxiety, jealousy, existential angst. Their biology is part of "what it means to be human". Subjectively unpleasant states of consciousness exist because they were genetically adaptive. Each of our core emotions had a distinct signalling role in our evolutionary past: they tended to promote behaviours that enhanced the inclusive fitness of our genes in the ancestral environment."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://abolitionist.com/|title=The Abolitionist Project|last=admin@abolitionist.com|website=abolitionist.com|access-date=2016-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Hedonism as a scientific basis for long-term future forecasting ====

Russian physicist and philosopher Victor Argonov argues that hedonism is not only a philosophical but also a verifiable scientific hypothesis. In 2014 he suggested "postulates of pleasure principle" confirmation of which would lead to a new scientific discipline, hedodynamics. Hedodynamics would be able to forecast the distant future development of human civilization and even the probable structure and psychology of other rational beings within the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Victor Argonov |title=The Pleasure Principle as a Tool for Scientific Forecasting of Human Self-Evolution |journal=Journal of Evolution and Thechnology |volume=24 |year=2014 | pages=63–78 | url=http://jetpress.org/v24/argonov.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In order to build such a theory, science must discover the neural correlate of pleasure - neurophysiological parameter unambiguously corresponding to the feeling of pleasure (hedonic tone).

According to Argonov, posthumans will be able to reprogram their motivations in an arbitrary manner (to get pleasure from any programmed activity).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Victor Argonov |title=Artificial programming of human motivations: A way to degradation or rapid development? |journal=Questions of Philosophy (in Russian) |volume=12 |year=2008 | pages=22–37 | url=http://transhumanism-russia.ru/content/view/392/144}}&lt;/ref&gt; And if pleasure principle postulates are true, then general direction of civilization development is obvious: maximization of integral happiness in posthuman life (product of life span and average happiness). Posthumans will avoid constant pleasure stimulation, because it is incompatible with rational behavior required to prolong life. However, in average, they can become much happier than modern humans.

Many other aspects of posthuman society could be predicted by hedodynamics if the neural correlate of pleasure were discovered. For example, optimal number of individuals, their optimal body size (whether it matters for happiness or not) and the degree of aggression.

==Criticisms==
Critics of hedonism have objected to its exclusive concentration on pleasure as valuable.

In particular, [[G. E. Moore]] offered a thought experiment in criticism of pleasure as the sole bearer of value: he imagined two worlds—one of exceeding beauty and the other a heap of filth. Neither of these worlds will be experienced by anyone. The question, then, is if it is better for the beautiful world to exist than the heap of filth. In this Moore implied that states of affairs have value beyond conscious pleasure, which he said spoke against the validity of hedonism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/hedonism/#SH3c%7ctitle=Hedonism%7cwork=utm.edu%7ctitle=Hedonism%7cwork=utm.edu|title=Hedonism|website=utm.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic criticisms===
In [[Islam]], God admonished mankind not to love the worldly pleasures, since they are related with greed and sources of sinful habits. He also threatened those who prefer worldly life rather than hereafter with [[Hell]]. Few Muslim scholars believe that God doesn't ask for the renunciation of all pleasure, but rather for the deliverance of corresponding responsibilities which come with pleasure.

{{blockquote|''Those who choose the worldly life and its pleasures will be given proper recompense for their deeds in this life and will not suffer any loss. Such people will receive nothing in the next life except Hell fire. Their deeds will be made devoid of all virtue and their efforts will be in vain.''|[http://almubin.tripod.com/mdsarwar.htm Quran 11:15-16, (Muhammad Sarwar translation)]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.islamkingdom.com/en/quran-translation/sarwar/hood/15 Quran chapter 11:15, translated by Muhammad Sarwar]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.islamkingdom.com/en/quran-translation/sarwar/hood/16 Quran chapter 11:16, translated by Muhammad Sarwar]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The '''ITS launch vehicle''' was a 2016-2017 design for a [[private spaceflight|privately funded]] [[orbital spaceflight|orbital]] [[launch vehicle]] planned to be developed by [[SpaceX]].  Design work was discontinued in 2017 when development was shifted to a smaller version, now called [[BFR (rocket)|BFR]].&lt;ref name=issR&amp;Dconf20170719-49:48/&gt; 
The initial design objective of the ITS launch vehicle was to launch a variety of SpaceX [[Interplanetary Transport System]] missions to [[Mars]] and other destinations in the [[beyond Earth orbit|beyond-Earth-orbit]] portion of the [[Solar System]]. The first launch was not expected before the 2020s.&lt;ref name=sn20160927/&gt; 

The ITS launch vehicle was to be operated as a somewhat unusual [[multistage rocket|two-stage]] rocket. Its first stage was to have been powered by 42 [[Raptor (rocket engine family)|Raptor rocket engines]]—designed and manufactured by SpaceX—operating on [[subcooling|densified]] (chilled near [[Methane (data page)|triple point]]) [[liquid methane|methane]]/[[liquid oxygen|oxygen]], [[propellant]]s that have not been widely used as rocket propellants in the past. Like the [[Falcon 9]] orbital launch vehicle that preceded it, the ITS launch vehicle's [[Multistage rocket|first stage]] design was intended to be [[reusable launch system|reusable]], following a [[Return to Launch Site|return to the launch site]] and [[VTVL|vertical landing]] following each launch. When announced, it was also designed to have a new feature for SpaceX launch vehicles:  full reusability of even the second-stage and orbital spacecraft as well.  The large payload capacity of the launch vehicle placed it into the [[Super heavy-lift launch vehicle|super-heavy lift]] class, with the ability to place {{convert|300|tonnes|lb}} into [[low Earth orbit]] in [[reusable launch vehicle|reusable]] configuration and {{convert|550|tonnes|lb}} in [[expendable launch vehicle|expendable]] mode.&lt;ref name=spacex-itspresentation201609/&gt;

The [[second stage]] of the Earth launch vehicle was planned to have two versions, the ''Interplanetary spaceship'' for passengers and cargo and the ''ITS tanker'' to deliver [[Rocket propellant|propellants]] to Earth orbit. Both were to be powered by six vacuum-optimized Raptor rocket engines with three additional sea-level-nozzle Raptor engines for maneuvering.  Thus, the element of the launch vehicle that was to provide second-stage acceleration to [[orbital speed|orbital velocity]] on all launches from Earth would also be used as an on-orbit spacecraft.  The ''Interplanetary spaceship'' was planned as a very long-duration carrier of both [[human spaceflight|passengers]] and space cargo to [[interplanetary spaceflight|interplanetary destinations]], and was to have served as both a [[Mars landing|descent]] and ascent vehicle at Mars.

The high-level specifications for the vehicle were publicly announced in September 2016, but by July 2017, SpaceX had stated they would not build the {{cvt|12|m|adj=on}}-diameter vehicles as previously planned, but would instead build a "still large" but much smaller launch vehicle first.&lt;ref name=issR&amp;Dconf20170719-49:48/&gt; Subsequently, that was revealed to be the [[BFR (rocket)|BFR]] in September 2017, a vehicle intended to cost-effectively replace and supersede all existing SpaceX launch vehicles and passenger/cargo spacecraft.&lt;ref name=sn20170929/&gt;&lt;ref name=verge20170926/&gt;

== History ==

The launch vehicle was initially mentioned in public discussions by [[Elon Musk]] in 2012 as part of SpaceX{{'s}} description of its overall Mars system architecture, then known as the ''Mars Colonial Transporter'' (MCT).&lt;ref name=dn20121213/&gt;  MCT was [[SpaceX]]'s name for its [[private equity|privately funded]] [[New product development|development project]] to design and build a spaceflight system&lt;ref name=nsf20140307/&gt; of [[reusable launch vehicle|reusable]] [[rocket engine]]s, [[launch vehicle]]s and [[space capsule]]s to eventually [[human mission to Mars|transport humans to Mars]] and return them to [[Earth]].

As early as 2007 however, Musk had stated a personal goal of eventually enabling [[exploration of Mars|human exploration]] and [[colonization of Mars|settlement of Mars]].&lt;ref name=wired20070522&gt;{{cite news|last=Hoffman|first=Carl|title=Elon Musk Is Betting His Fortune on a Mission Beyond Earth's Orbit|url=https://www.wired.com/science/space/magazine/15-06/ff_space_musk?currentPage=all| accessdate=2014-03-14| newspaper=Wired Magazine| date=2007-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mw20110422&gt;{{cite news|title=Elon Musk: I'll Put a Man on Mars in 10 Years |url=http://www.marketwatch.com/video/asset/elon-musk-ill-put-a-man-on-mars-in-10-years-2011-04-22/CCF1FC62-BB0D-4561-938C-DF0DEFAD15BA#!CCF1FC62-BB0D-4561-938C-DF0DEFAD15BA |newspaper=Market Watch |date=2011-04-22 |publisher=The Wall Street Journal |location=New York |accessdate=2011-12-01 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/63bvaGo3E?url=http://www.marketwatch.com/video/asset/elon-musk-ill-put-a-man-on-mars-in-10-years-2011-04-22/CCF1FC62-BB0D-4561-938C-DF0DEFAD15BA |deadurl=no |archivedate=1 December 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012, Musk first publicly articulated a high-level plan to build a second reusable rocket system with capabilities substantially beyond the [[Falcon 9]]/[[Falcon Heavy]] launch vehicles on which SpaceX had by then spent several billion US dollars.&lt;ref name=fg20121015&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/spacex-aims-big-with-massive-new-rocket-377687/ |title=SpaceX aims big with massive new rocket |date=15 Oct 2012 |author=Zach Rosenberg |accessdate=2016-09-25 |publisher=Flight Global }}&lt;/ref&gt; This new vehicle was to be "an evolution of SpaceX's Falcon 9 booster ... much bigger [than Falcon 9]."

According to SpaceX engine development head [[Tom Mueller]], concept designs at the time indicated SpaceX could use nine [[Raptor (rocket engine family)|Raptor]] engines on a single rocket, similar to the use of nine [[Merlin (rocket engine family)#Merlin 1D|Merlin]] engines on each [[Falcon 9]] booster core, in order "to put over 100 tons of cargo on Mars."&lt;ref name=pbt20140219/&gt;

By August 2014, media sources speculated that the initial [[flight test]] of the Raptor-driven super-heavy launch vehicle could occur as early as 2020, in order to fully test the engines under orbital spaceflight conditions; however, any colonization effort was then reported to continue to be "deep into the future".&lt;ref name=nsf20140830&gt;

== Description and technical specifications ==

The ITS launch vehicle stack is composed of two stages.  The first stage is always an ''interplanetary booster'' while the second stage may be either an ''interplanetary spaceship'' (for beyond-Earth-orbit missions) or an ''ITS tanker'' (for on-orbit propellant transfer operations).

Both stages of the ITS launch vehicle were to be powered by [[Raptor (rocket engine family)|Raptor]] [[bipropellant|bipropellant liquid]] [[rocket engine]]s utilizing the [[full flow staged combustion cycle]] with [[liquid methane]] fuel and [[liquid oxygen]] oxidizer.&lt;ref name=nsf20150511&gt;

The self-pressurization gas system is a critical part of SpaceX strategy to reduce launch vehicle fluids from five in their legacy Falcon 9 vehicle family to just two, eliminating not only the helium tank pressurant but all [[hypergolic propellant]]s as well as [[nitrogen]] for cold-gas reaction-control thrusters.&lt;ref name=nsf20161003/&gt;

The overall launch vehicle height, first stage and the integrated second-stage/spacecraft, will be {{cvt|122|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=MuskTweetPreSpeech&gt;https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/780831628104966144&lt;/ref&gt; Both stages of the ITS LV will be constructed of lightweight-yet-strong [[carbon fiber]], even the [[deep cryogenic|deep-cryogenic]] propellant tanks,&lt;!-- an initial ground-test article tank has already been built and test of the carbon fiber material and construction technique, as of Sep 2016. --&gt; a major change from the [[aluminum-lithium alloy]] tank and structure material used in SpaceX Falcon 9 family of launch vehicles.

[[File:Interplanetary Transport System (29937260386).jpg|thumb|300px|Rendering of the reusable ITS booster in descent]]

===ITS booster===

The first-stage '''ITS booster'''&lt;!-- Bolded per [[WP:MOS]]/[[WP:MOSBOLD]] as redirected term to this article section --&gt;, or Interplanetary booster—is a {{convert|12|m|ft|0|abbr=on|adj=on}}-diameter, {{convert|77.5|m|ft|0|abbr=on|adj=on}}-high, reusable rocket &lt;!-- with a dry mass of {{cvt|1234|MT|ST|0|abbr=on}} --&gt;powered by 42 sea-level rated [[Raptor (rocket engine)|Raptor engines]] producing over {{convert|3024|kN|lbf}} of [[thrust]] in each engine. Total booster thrust is approximately {{convert|29000000|lbf|MN|order=flip|abbr=on}}, several times the {{convert|8000000|lbf|MN|order=flip|abbr=on}} thrust of the [[Saturn V]] Moon mission launch vehicle.&lt;ref name=nsf20160927a/&gt;

The engine configuration will include 21 engines in the outer ring and 14 in the inner ring, with these 35 engines fixed in place.  The center cluster of seven engines are [[gimbaled thrust|gimbaled]] for directional control, although some directional control to the rocket is also available by utilizing [[Differential engine thrust|differential thrust]] on the fixed engines.  Design thrust on each engine is [[rocket engine throttling|variable]] between 20 and 100 percent of rated thrust.&lt;ref name=sfi20160927/&gt;

Methane/oxygen will also be used to power the [[reaction control system|control thrusters]], as [[cold gas thruster|gas thrusters]] rather than the subcooled liquid used to power the main engines. The methalox control thrusters will be used to control booster orientation in space, as well as to help provide additional accuracy in landing once the velocity of the descending booster has slowed.&lt;ref name=sfi20160927/&gt;

The design is intended to use about seven percent of the total propellant load at launch in order to support the reusable aspect and bring the booster [[Return To Launch Site|back to the launch pad]] for a [[VTVL|vertical landing]], assessment, and relaunch,&lt;ref name=sfi20160927&gt;

During [[atmospheric reentry]], once the [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]] is sufficiently dense, [[grid fin]]s will be used to control the attitude of the rocket and fine tune the landing location.&lt;ref name=sfi20160927/&gt;
The booster return flights are expected to encounter loads that are lower than those experienced on the Falcon 9 rentries, principally because it will have both a lower mass ratio and a lower density than Falcon 9.&lt;ref name=gw20161023/&gt;
The booster will be designed for 20&amp;nbsp;[[G's|G]] nominal loads, and possibly as high as 30–40&amp;nbsp;G's without breaking up.&lt;ref name=gw20161023/&gt;

In contrast to the landing approach used on SpaceX mid-2010s reusable rocket first stages—either a large, flat concrete pad or [[downrange]] [[Autonomous spaceport drone ship|floating landing platform]] used with Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy—the ITS booster was to be designed to land on a [[Launch mount landing pad|launch mount]] itself, where it may then be refilled with propellant and checked out for follow-on flights.&lt;ref name=sfi20160927/&gt;

=== Spacecraft that operate briefly as upper stages during launch ===

The ITS launch vehicle does not have a dedicated and single-function [[second stage]] in the way most launch vehicles have had.  Instead, the upper stage function of gaining sufficient velocity to place a payload into [[orbit|Earth orbit]] is provided as a relatively short term role by a [[spacecraft]] that has all the requisite systems for long-duration spaceflight.&lt;ref name=sfi20160927/&gt;  This is not a role that most upper stages have had in launch vehicle designs through the 2010s, as typical upper stage on-orbit life is measured in hours.
Previous exceptions to this norm exist, for example the [[Space Shuttle]] orbiter provided part of the boost energy and all of the second stage energy for lofting itself into low-Earth orbit.  Differences also exist: the Space Shuttle expended its propellant tank and primary launch vehicle structure on ascent, whereas the ITS first- and second-stage options are designed to be fully reusable.

In the 2016 design, SpaceX had identified two spacecraft that would also play the upper stage role on each Earth-away launch: the ''interplanetary spaceship''  and the ''ITS tanker''.
Both spacecraft are the same physical external dimensions: {{convert|49.5|m|ft|sp=us|abbr=on|adj=on}}-long and {{convert|12|m|ft|sp=us|abbr=on|adj=on}}-diameter {{convert|17|m|ft|sp=us|abbr=on}} across at the widest point. Both designs were powered by six vacuum-optimized Raptor engines, each producing {{convert|3.5|MN|lbf|abbr=on}} thrust, and were to have had three lower-expansion-ratio Raptor engines for in-space maneuvering as well as during descent and landing to allow for reuse on future launches.&lt;ref name=nsf20160927a/&gt;&lt;ref name=spacex-itspresentation201609/&gt;

==== Interplanetary spaceship ====

The '''Interplanetary spaceship'''&lt;!-- Bolded per [[WP:MOS]]/[[WP:MOSBOLD]] as redirected term to this article section --&gt; was a large passenger-carrying [[spacecraft]] design proposed by SpaceX as part of their ITS launch vehicle in September 2016.  The ship would operate as a second-stage of the orbital launch vehicle on Earth-ascents—and would also be the [[Beyond Earth orbit|interplanetary]] [[space transport|transport]] vehicle for both cargo and passengers—&lt;!-- where the second stage is both a traditional second stage—used to accelerate the vehicle to [[orbital speed|orbital velocity]]—and is also a [[space capsule]] capable of supporting long-term transits to interplanetary locations. --&gt; capable of transporting up to {{convert|450|tonne|lbs}} of cargo per trip to Mars following propellant-refill in Earth orbit.&lt;ref name=nsf20160927a/&gt;

[[File:SpaceX-InterplanetarySpaceship-back quarter view-with solar extended (cropped &amp; retouched).jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.15|Back-quarter view of a rendering of the ''interplanetary spaceship'' from engineering drawings, with the [[Solar panels on spacecraft|solar panels]] extended.]]

In addition to use during maneuvering, descent and landing, the three lower-expansion-ratio Raptor engines were also to have been used for initial ascent from the surface of Mars.&lt;ref name=nsf20160927a/&gt;
In 2016, the first test launch of a spaceship was not expected until 2020 or later, and the first flight of the ITS booster was expected to follow a year or more later.&lt;!-- no explicit mention of tanker schedule in any source; could be earlier (as a "pre-spaceship" SSTO test vehicle) or later than the spaceship and booster --&gt;&lt;ref name=sn20160927&gt;
{{cite news |last=Foust|first=Jeff |url=http://spacenews.com/spacex-unveils-mars-mission-plans/ |title=SpaceX’s Mars plans call for massive 42-engine reusable rocket |work=[[SpaceNews]] |date=2016-09-27 |accessdate=2016-10-14 |quote=Musk stated it’s possible that the first spaceship would be ready for tests in four years, with the booster ready a few years after that, but he shied away from exact schedules in his presentation. 'We’re kind of being intentionally fuzzy about the timeline,' he said. 'We’re going to try and make as much progress as we can with a very constrained budget.' }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ITS Tanker (cropped).jpg|thumb|Rendering of an ITS tanker (top) transferring propellant to an interplanetary spaceship (bottom) in Earth orbit.|246x246px]]
Early Mars flights—in the mid-2020s or later—were expected to carry mostly equipment and few people.&lt;ref name=dn20121213/&gt;

==== ITS tanker ====

The '''ITS tanker'''&lt;!-- Bolded per [[WP:MOS]]/[[WP:MOSBOLD]] as redirected term to this article section --&gt; is a [[propellant tanker]] variant of the ITS second stage spacecraft. This spacecraft design was to be used exclusively for launch and short-term holding of propellants to be transported to [[low-Earth orbit]].  Once on orbit, a [[proximity operations|rendezvous]] operation was to have been effected with one of the ''interplanetary spaceships'', [[autonomous robot|plumbing connections made]], while a maximum of {{convert|380|tonne|lbs}} of [[liquid methane]] and [[liquid oxygen]] propellants would be transferred in one load to the spaceship.  To fully fuel an ''interplanetary spaceship'' for a long-duration interplanetary flight, it was expected that up to five tankers would be required to launch from Earth, carrying and transferring a total of nearly {{convert|1900|tonne|lbs}} of propellant to fully load the spaceship for the journey.&lt;ref name=spacex-itspresentation201609/&gt;&lt;ref name=sfi20160927/&gt;

Following completion of the on-orbit propellant offloading, the reusable tanker was to [[atmospheric reentry|reenter]] the [[atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]], land, and be prepared for another tanker flight.&lt;ref name=spacex-itspresentation201609/&gt;

=== Reusability ===

Both stages were designed by SpaceX to be fully reusable and were to land [[VTVL|vertically,]] using a [[SpaceX reusable launch system development program|set of technologies previously developed by SpaceX and tested in 2013–2016 on a variety of Falcon 9 test vehicles]] as well as [[Falcon 9 first-stage landing tests|actual Falcon 9 launch vehicles]].&lt;ref name=nsf20160927a&gt;
{{cite news |last=Bergin|first=Chris |url=https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2016/09/spacex-reveals-mars-game-changer-colonization-plan/ |title=SpaceX reveals ITS Mars game changer via colonization plan |work=[[NASASpaceFlight.com]] |date=2016-09-27 |accessdate=2016-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Importantly, the "fully and rapidly reusable" aspect of the ITS launch vehicle and spacecraft design was the largest factor in the SpaceX analysis for bringing down the currently huge cost of transporting mass to space, in general, and to interplanetary destinations, in particular.  While the transport [[system]] under development in 2016-2017 relied on a combination of [[Interplanetary Transport System#Description|several elements]] to make long-duration [[beyond Earth orbit]] (BEO) spaceflights possible by reducing the cost per ton delivered to Mars, the reusability aspect of the launch and spacecraft vehicles alone was expected by SpaceX to reduce that cost by approximately {{nowrap|2 1/2}} [[orders of magnitude]] over what NASA had previously achieved on similar missions.  Musk stated that this is over half of the total {{nowrap|4 1/2}} orders of magnitude reduction that he believes is needed to enable a sustainable settlement off Earth to emerge.&lt;ref name="spacex-itsvideo201609-09:20"&gt;
{{cite AV media |people=Elon Musk |date=27 September 2016 |title=Making Humans a Multiplanetary Species |trans-title= |medium=video |language= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7Uyfqi_TE8 |access-date=10 October 2016 |format= |time=9:20–10:10 |location=IAC67, Guadalajara, Mexico |publisher=SpaceX |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote=''So it is a bit tricky. Because we have to figure out how to improve the cost of the trips to Mars by five million percent ... translates to an improvement of approximately 4 1/2 orders of magnitude. These are the key elements that are needed in order to achieve a 4 1/2 order of magnitude improvement.  Most of the improvement would come from full reusability—somewhere between 2 and 2 1/2 orders of magnitude—and then the other 2 orders of magnitude would come from refilling in orbit, propellant production on Mars, and choosing the right propellant.'' |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=spacex-itspresentation201609/&gt;

=== Launch location ===

When announced in September 2016, the targeted location for initial launches of the ITS launch vehicle was [[LC-39A]], at SpaceX's leased pad at [[Launch pad 39A]] on the [[Florida]] [[space coast|coast]], the same launchpad where [[Apollo 11]] launched in 1969 to the Moon. Subsequent Apollo Missions were also launched from the pad.&lt;ref name=nsf20160927a/&gt;

== Operations concept ==

The [[concept of operations]] for ITS launches envisioned the fully loaded second-stage reaching orbit with only minimal propellant remaining in the ''interplanetary spaceship'' vehicle's tanks.  Then, while the spaceship remained in Earth orbit, three to five cargo second stages—called ''ITS tankers''—would be launched from Earth carrying additional [[liquid methane|methane]] fuel and [[liquid oxygen]] oxidizer to [[proximity operations|rendezvous with]], and [[propellant depot|transfer propellant to]], the outgoing spaceship.  Once refueled, the spaceship was to perform a [[trans-Mars injection]] burn, departing Earth orbit for the interplanetary portion of the journey.&lt;ref name=nsf20160927a/&gt;

== Economic considerations ==

=== Funding ===

The [[New product development|development]] work on the new two-stage launch vehicle design was [[private spaceflight|privately funded]] by SpaceX. The entire project is even possible only as a result of SpaceX multi-faceted approach focusing on the reduction of launch [[cost]]s.&lt;ref name=nsf20160927a/&gt;

The full build-out of the Mars colonialization plans was envisioned by Musk in 2016 to be funded by [[public private partnership|both private and public funds]].  The speed of commercially available Mars transport for both cargo and humans will be driven, in large part, by [[demand (economics)|market demand]] as well as constrained by the [[supply (economics)|technology development and development funding]].

Elon Musk said that there is no expectation of receiving NASA contracts for any of the ITS system work SpaceX was doing. He also indicated that such contracts, if received, would be good.&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/SpcPlcyOnline/status/780894498893225984 https://twitter.com/SpcPlcyOnline/status/780894498893225984]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Competition for the American super-heavy-lift market ===
In August 2014, media sources noted that the US launch market might have two [[Space launch market competition|competitive launch vehicles]] available in the 2020s to launch payloads of {{convert|100|tonnes|lb}} or more to low Earth orbit.  The [[Federal government of the United States|US government]] is currently developing the [[Space Launch System]] (SLS), a [[super heavy-lift launch vehicle]] designed to propel very large payloads of {{convert|70|to|130|tonnes|lb}} to low Earth orbit.&lt;ref name="nsf20140830"/&gt;&lt;ref name=KSC-SLS-manifest&gt;
{{cite news |title=KSC meeting portrays SLS as scrambling for a manifest plan |url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2016/01/ksc-meeting-sls-scrambling-manifest-plan/ |accessdate=14 January 2016 |date=12 January 2016 |quote=''Also notable – though understandably not referenced at the KSC meeting – is SpaceX’s plan to have its BFR – a reusable booster with the power of two Saturn Vs – already up and running by the 2020s, ahead of MCT (Mars Colonial Transporter) missions.'' }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Blue Origin]]'s [[New Glenn]] rocket, announced in September 2016, is also expected to compete in the super-heavy lift class.&lt;ref name=sfi20160912&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.spaceflightinsider.com/organizations/blue-origin/blue-origin-reveals-new-glenn-launch-vehicle-plans/ |title=Blue Origin reveals New Glenn launch vehicle plans |work=Spaceflight Insider |first=Bart|last=Leahy |date=12 September 2016 |accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2017, New Glenn's reusable payload capacity was announced as 45 tonnes to LEO and 13 tonnes to GTO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spacenews.com/eutelsat-first-customer-for-blue-origins-new-glenn/|title=Eutelsat first customer for Blue Origin’s New Glenn|last=Foust|first=Jeff|publisher=Space News|date=March 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Justice for Jews from Arab Countries (JJAC)''' is a [[political advocacy]] organization founded in New York in 2002, which was formed by the [[Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations|Conference of Presidents]], the [[World Jewish Congress]], the [[American Sephardi Federation]], and the [[World Organization of Jews from Arab Countries]]. Today, JJAC works with the [[American Jewish Committee]], [[American Jewish Congress]], [[Jewish Council for Public Affairs]], the World Sephardic Congress.&lt;ref&gt;Urman, Seeking Justice for Displaced Jews, October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission statement==
Its mission statement is:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justiceforjews.com/mission.html Mission Statement]&lt;/ref&gt;
*a) To represent the interests of Jews from Arab countries;
*b) To recognize the legacy of Jewish refugees from Arab countries;
*c) To register and record personal testimonies of Jews from Arab countries, in order to preserve their history and heritage;
*d) To serve as a clearing house of information and documentation on Jewish refugees from Arab countries; and
*e) To conduct public education programs that provide historical perspective, in the pursuit of truth, justice and reconciliation.

==Achievements==
According to founder Stanley Urman in 2009, "Perhaps our most significant accomplishment was the adoption in April 2008 by the United States Congress of Resolution 185, which granted the first-ever recognition of Jewish refugees from the Arab countries. This now requires US diplomats in all Middle East negotiations to refer to a quote of what the resolution calls "multiple population of refugees" with a specific injunction that hands forth any specific reference and "any specific reference to the Palestinian refugees must be matched by an explicit reference to Jewish refugees"... our mandate is to follow that lead. Any explicit reference to Palestinians should be followed by explicit reference to Jewish refugees."&lt;ref&gt;Urman, Seeking Justice for Displaced Jews, October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics have suggested that JJAC's resolution was "a tactic to help the Israeli government deflect Palestinian refugee claims in any final Israeli-Palestinian peace deal, claims that include Palestinian refugees' demand for the "right of return" to their pre-1948 homes in Israel."&lt;ref&gt;Fischbach, 2008, "On 1 April 2008, the New York–based coalition Justice for Jews from Arab Countries (JJAC) announced that the U.S. House of Representatives had passed Resolution 185 (H.Res. 185), a nonbinding "sense of the House" resolution concerning the fate of 800,000 Jews who left Arab countries in the wake of the first Arab-Israeli war of 1948, some without their property. Describing these Jews as "refugees," the resolution called on the U.S. president to ensure that American representatives participating in international fora refer to the plight of Jewish refugees from Arab countries whenever mention is made of the 1948 Palestinian refugees. H.Res. 185—which JJAC helped to write—was not an effort to demand compensation for Jewish property losses in the Arab world, but rather a tactic to help the Israeli government deflect Palestinian refugee claims in any final Israeli-Palestinian peace deal, claims that include Palestinian refugees' demand for the "right of return" to their pre-1948 homes in Israel."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Keith Porteous Wood''' (born November 1947) is the president of the [[National Secular Society]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. From 1996 until November 2017 he held the paid position of [[Secretary (title)|general secretary]] which was later re-titled [[executive director]].

In 2007, he received the Distinguished Service to Humanism Award from the [[International Humanist and Ethical Union]] for his work in building up the National Secular Society and campaigning for secularism both nationally and internationally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iheu.org/node/2641 2007 award for Distinguished Service to Humanism, citation]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Before his appointment as National Secular Society general secretary in 1996, Wood had been director of finance for companies in the wholesale and retail food distribution, financial services and insurance sectors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skeptic.org.uk/pub/archive/ ''The Skeptic'', author archive]&lt;/ref&gt;

On his retirement in 2017, he stepped down from his position as the executive director and was elected president, replacing his [[Civil partnership in the United Kingdom|civil partner]] [[Terry Sanderson (writer)|Terry Sanderson]], who was president for eleven years before stepping down and being elected a [[vice president]]. They had been together for over two decades before civil partnerships were introduced in 2005, and they entered into a civil partnership in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.campaignforhomosexualequality.org.uk/pdfs/annual_report_2005-06.pdf Campaign for Homosexual Equality, Annual Report, 2005-2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Secularist and humanist activities==
In 1996, Wood was appointed general secretary of the [[National Secular Society]], following the retirement of Terry Mullins (who had held the post since 1979). Describing him as a "radical campaigner in a business suit", [[Peter Brearey]], then editor of ''[[The Freethinker (journal)|The Freethinker]]'', welcomed Wood's appointment, noting his campaigning track record and background of "25 years in senior managerial and professional roles covering administration, accounting, legal and company secretarial issues."&lt;ref&gt;Brearey (1996, p.7)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, following criticisms from [[George Carey|Lord Carey]], that David Cameron was "feeding anxieties" about Christian persecution and "that the government seemed to be "aiding and abetting" aggressive secularisation," Wood declared that Carey had "no right to insist that his discriminatory and intolerant views should prevail over those of the public and Parliament.”&lt;ref name=Beeb&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-21979034|title=Lord Carey attacks PM over Christian 'support'|work=BBC news|date=30 March 2013|accessdate=30 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an international representative of the International Humanist and Ethical Union, he has criticised the [[Holy See and the United Nations|activities of the Holy See within the United Nations system]] and accused the Vatican of not fulfilling its political obligations under the [[UN Convention on the Rights of the Child]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iheu.org/iheu-calls-vatican-recognize-its-responsibilities-children-and-under-un-convention UN: IHEU calls the Vatican to account over child abuse]&lt;/ref&gt; Wood is strongly critical of the Vatican and the Roman Catholic Church over [[Catholic sex abuse cases]], [[Roman Catholic sex abuse cases by country|worldwide]] and corruption in the Vatican. He stated, ''"Child abuse is a major issue, along with corruption, that he [Pope Francis] needs to sort out. His legacy will be judged, I think, on his ability to deal with these immensely difficult problems."''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abolishsexabuse.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1771:un-tells-vatican-to-hand-over-details-of-child-sex-abuse-cases&amp;catid=71:world-news&amp;Itemid=181 UN tells Vatican to hand over details of child sex abuse cases]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19936">In [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]], the '''Krohn–Rhodes theory''' (or '''algebraic automata theory''') is an approach to the study of finite [[semigroup]]s and [[automata theory|automata]] that seeks to decompose them in terms of elementary components. These components correspond to finite [[aperiodic semigroup]]s and finite [[simple groups]] that are combined together in a feedback-free manner (called a "[[wreath product]]" or "cascade").

Krohn and [[John Rhodes (mathematician)|Rhodes]] found a general decomposition for [[finite automata]]. In doing their research, though, the authors discovered and proved an unexpected major result in finite semigroup theory, revealing a deep connection between finite automata and semigroups.

==Definitions and description of the Krohn–Rhodes theorem  {{anchor|Description of the Krohn–Rhodes theorem}} ==
A [[semigroup]] ''S'' that is a [[homomorphic]] image of a [[subsemigroup]] of ''T'' is said to be a '''divisor''' of ''T''.

The '''Krohn–Rhodes theorem for finite semigroups''' states that every finite semigroup ''S'' is a divisor of a finite alternating [[wreath product]] of finite [[simple group]]s, each a divisor of ''S'', and finite [[aperiodic semigroup]]s (which contain no nontrivial [[subgroup]]s).&lt;ref name=Hol142&gt;Holcombe (1982) pp. 141–142&lt;/ref&gt;

In the automata formulation, the '''Krohn–Rhodes theorem for finite automata'''  states that given a [[finite automaton]] ''A'' with states ''Q'' and input set ''I'', output alphabet ''U'', then one can expand the states to ''Q' '' such that the new automaton ''A' '' embeds into a cascade of "simple", irreducible automata: In particular, ''A'' is emulated by a feed-forward cascade of  (1) automata whose transitions semigroups are  [[finite simple groups]] and (2) automata which are banks of [[flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flop]]s running in parallel.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;The flip-flop is the two-state automaton with three input operations: the identity (which leaves its state unchanged) and the two reset operations (which overwrite the current state by a resetting to a particular one of the two states). This can be considered a one-[[bit]] read-write storage unit: the identity corresponds to reading the bit (while leaving its value unaltered), and the two resets to setting the value of the bit to 0 or 1. Note that a reset is an irreversible operator as it destroys the currently stored bit value.  NB: The semigroup of the flip-flop and all its subsemigroups are irreducible.&lt;/ref&gt; The new automaton ''A' ''     has the same input and output symbols as ''A''. Here, both the states and inputs of the cascaded automata have a very special hierarchical coordinate form.

Moreover, each simple group (''prime'') or non-group irreducible semigroup (subsemigroup of the [[semigroup with three elements|flip-flop monoid]]) that divides the transformation semigroup of ''A'' must divide the transition semigroup of some component of the cascade, and only the primes that must occur as divisors of the components are those that divide ''A'' 's transition semigroup.

==Group complexity==
The '''Krohn–Rhodes complexity''' (also called '''group complexity''' or just '''[[complexity]]''') of a finite semigroup ''S'' is the least number of groups in a [[wreath product]] of finite groups and finite aperiodic semigroups of which ''S'' is a divisor.

All finite aperiodic semigroups have complexity 0, while non-[[trivial (mathematics)|trivial]] finite groups have complexity 1. In fact, there are semigroups of every non-negative [[integer]] complexity. For example, for any ''n'' greater than 1, the multiplicative semigroup of all (''n''+1)×(''n''+1) upper triangular [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] over any fixed finite [[field (mathematics)|field]] has complexity ''n'' (Kambites, 2007).

A major open problem in finite semigroup theory is the ''decidability of complexity'': is there an [[algorithm]] that will compute the Krohn–Rhodes complexity of a finite semigroup, given its [[multiplication table]]?
Upper bounds and ever more precise lower bounds on complexity have been obtained (see, e.g. Rhodes &amp; Steinberg, 2009).   Rhodes has conjectured that the problem is decidable.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;J.  Rhodes, Keynote talk at the International Conference on Semigroups &amp; Algebraic Engineering (Aizu, Japan), 26 March 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and applications==
At a conference in 1962, [[Kenneth Krohn]] and [[John Rhodes (mathematician)|John Rhodes]] announced a method for decomposing a [[Deterministic finite automaton|(deterministic) finite automaton]] into "simple" components that are themselves finite automata.  This joint work, which has implications for philosophy, comprised both Krohn's doctoral thesis at [[Harvard University]], and Rhodes' doctoral thesis at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]].&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;[[Morris Hirsch|Morris W. Hirsch]], "Foreword to Rhodes' ''Applications of Automata Theory and Algebra''".  In J. Rhodes, ''Applications of Automata Theory and Algebra: Via the Mathematical Theory of Complexity to Biology, Physics, Philosophy  and Games", (ed. C. L. Nehaniv), World Scientific Publishing Co.,  2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  Simpler proofs, and generalizations of the theorem to infinite structures, have been published since then (see Chapter 4 of Steinberg and Rhodes' 2009 book ''The'' q-''Theory of Finite Semigroups'' for an overview).

In the 1965 paper by Krohn and Rhodes, the proof of the theorem on the decomposition of finite automata (or, equivalently [[sequential machines]]) made extensive use of the algebraic [[semigroup]] structure.  Later proofs contained major simplifications using finite [[wreath product]]s of finite transformation semigroups. The theorem generalizes the [[Jordan–Hölder decomposition]] for finite groups (in which the primes are the finite simple groups), to all finite transformation semigroups (for which the primes are again the finite simple groups plus all subsemigroups of the "flip-flop" (see above)). Both the group and more general finite automata decomposition require expanding the state-set of the general, but allow for the same number of input symbols. In the general case, these are embedded in a larger structure with a hierarchical "coordinate system".

One must be careful in understanding the notion of "prime" as Krohn and Rhodes explicitly refer to their theorem as a "prime decomposition theorem" for automata. The components in the decomposition, however, are not prime automata (with ''prime'' defined in a naïve way); rather, the notion of ''prime'' is more sophisticated and algebraic: the semigroups and groups associated to the constituent automata of the decomposition are prime (or irreducible) in a strict and natural algebraic sense with respect to the wreath product (Eilenberg, 1976). Also, unlike earlier decomposition theorems, the Krohn–Rhodes decompositions usually require expansion of the state-set, so that the expanded automaton covers (emulates) the one being decomposed. These facts have made the theorem difficult to understand, and challenging to apply in a practical way—until recently, when computational implementations became available (Egri-Nagy &amp; Nehaniv 2005, 2008).

H.P. Zeiger (1967) proved an important variant called the '''holonomy decomposition''' (Eilenberg  1976).&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Eilenberg 1976, as well as Dömösi and Nehaniv, 2005, present proofs that correct an error in Zeiger's paper.&lt;/ref&gt;  The holonomy method appears to be relatively efficient and has been implemented computationally by A. Egri-Nagy (Egri-Nagy &amp; Nehaniv 2005).

Meyer and Thompson (1969) give a version of Krohn–Rhodes decomposition for finite automata that is equivalent to the decomposition previously developed by Hartmanis and Stearns, but for useful decompositions, the notion of ''expanding'' the state-set of the original automaton is essential (for the non-permutation automata case).

Many proofs and constructions now exist of Krohn–Rhodes decompositions (e.g., [Krohn, Rhodes &amp; Tilson 1968], [Ésik 2000], [Diekert et al. 2012]), with the holonomy method the most popular and efficient in general (although not in all cases). Due to the close relation between monoids and categories, a version of the Krohn–Rhodes theorem is applicable to [[category theory]]. This observation and a proof of an analogous result were offered by Wells (1980).&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;See also (Tilson 1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Krohn–Rhodes theorem for semigroups/monoids is an analogue of the [[Jordan–Hölder theorem]] for finite groups (for semigroups/monoids rather than groups). As such, the theorem is a deep and important result in semigroup/monoid theory. The theorem was also surprising to many mathematicians and computer scientists&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;C.L. Nehaniv, Preface to (Rhodes, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; since it had previously been widely believed that the semigroup/monoid axioms were too weak to admit a structure theorem of any strength, and prior work (Hartmanis &amp; Stearns) was only able to show much more rigid and less general decomposition results for finite automata.

Work by Egri-Nagy and Nehaniv (2005, 2008–) continues to further automate the holonomy version of the Krohn–Rhodes decomposition extended with the related decomposition for finite groups (so-called [[Frobenius–Lagrange coordinates]]) using the [[computer algebra system]] [[GAP computer algebra system|GAP]].

Applications outside of the semigroup and monoid theories are now computationally feasible.  They include computations in [[biology]] and biochemical systems (e.g. Egri-Nagy &amp; Nehaniv 2008), [[artificial intelligence]], finite-state [[physics]], [[psychology]], and [[game theory]] (see, for example, Rhodes 2009).

==Mindfulness practice==
Mindfulness practice involves the process of developing the skill of bringing one’s attention to whatever is happening in the present moment.&lt;ref name=" Kabat-Zinn_2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Karunamuni2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Mindfulness in plain English"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gunaratana |first1=Bhante |title= Mindfulness in plain English |date=2011 |publisher= Wisdom Publications |location= Boston |isbn=978-0861719068 |page=21 |url= http://www.wisdompubs.org/sites/default/files/preview/Mindfulness%20in%20Plain%20English%20Book%20Preview.pdf |accessdate=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several exercises designed to develop mindfulness meditation, which are aided by [[guided meditation]]s "to get the hang of it."&lt;ref&gt;Kabat-Zinn himself, in ''Full Catastrophe Living (Revised Edition)'' (2013), p. lxiv&lt;/ref&gt;{{R|"Nisbet"}}{{refn|group=note|Kabat-Zinn, in ''Full Catastrophe Living (Revised Edition)'' (2013), p. lxiv advises to use CD's with guided mindfulness practices: "Almost everybody finds it easier, when embarking for the first time on a daily meditation practice, to listen to an instructor-guided audio program and let it "carry them along" in the early stages, until they get the hang of it from the inside, rather than attempting to follow instructions from a book, however clear and detailed they may be."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Compare Rupert Gethin (2004), ''On the practice of Buddhist meditation'', pp. 202–03, noting that the Buddhist sutras hardly explain how to meditate, and then stating that "the effective practice of meditation requires the personal instruction of a teacher." Gethin seems to echo Vetter (1988), ''The Ideas and Meditative Practices of Early Buddhism'', who notes that the ''[[:Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta]]'' describes the Buddha as instructing his first followers in turn: instructing two or three of them, while the others go out begging for food, signifying the need of personal instruction to learn ho to practice ''dhyana''.}} One method is to sit on a straight-backed chair or sit cross-legged on the floor or a cushion, close one’s eyes and bring attention to either the sensations of breathing in the proximity of one’s nostrils or to the movements of the abdomen when breathing in and out.&lt;ref group=web name=AskDrK&gt;{{cite web |last=Komaroff |first=Anthony |title=Does "mindfulness meditation" really help relieve stress and anxiety? |url= http://www.askdoctork.com/mindfulness-meditation-really-help-relieve-stress-anxiety-201403316226 |work=Ask Doctor K |publisher= Harvard Health Publications |accessdate=22 April 2014 |date= March 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Wilson|2014}}&lt;ref name="Baer defines2"/&gt; In this meditation practice, one does not try to control one’s breathing, but attempts to simply be aware of one’s natural breathing process/rhythm.&lt;ref name=" Kabat-Zinn_2013"/&gt; When engaged in this practice, the mind will often run off to other thoughts and associations, and if this happens, one passively notices that the mind has wandered, and in an accepting, non-judgmental way, returns to focusing on breathing.

Other meditation exercises to develop mindfulness include body-scan meditation where attention is directed at various areas of the body and noting body sensations that happen in the present moment.&lt;ref name="Kabat-Zinn_2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Baer defines2"/&gt;  Engaging in yoga practices, while attending to movements and body sensations, as well as walking meditation are other methods of developing mindfulness.&lt;ref name=" Kabat-Zinn_2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Baer defines2"/&gt;  One could also focus on sounds, sensations, thoughts, feelings and actions that happen in the present.&lt;ref name="Kabat-Zinn_2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mindfulness in plain English"/&gt; In this regard, a famous exercise, introduced by Kabat-Zinn in his [[#Jon Kabat-Zinn and MBSR|MBSR]] program,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.umassmed.edu/cfm/mindfulness-based-programs/mbsr-courses/about-mbsr/history-of-mbsr/]&lt;/ref&gt; is the mindful tasting of a raisin,{{sfn|Ihnen|Flynn|2008|p=148}} in which a raisin is being tasted and eaten mindfully.{{sfn|Teasdale|Segal|2007|pp=55–56}}{{refn|group=note|See also [http://hfhc.ext.wvu.edu/r/download/114469 ''Eating One Raisin: A First Taste of Mindfulness''] for a hand-out file}}

Meditators are recommended to start with short periods of 10 minutes or so of meditation practice per day. As one practices regularly, it becomes easier to keep the attention focused on breathing.&lt;ref name="Kabat-Zinn_2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Time2014"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=24640415 |year=2014 |author1= Pickert |first1=K |title=The art of being mindful.

The Buddhist term translated into English as "mindfulness" originates in the Pali term ''[[Sati (Buddhism)|sati]]'' and in its Sanskrit counterpart [[smriti|''smṛti'']]. It is often translated as "bare attention," but in the Buddhist tradition it has a broader meaning and application, and the meaning of these terms has been the topic of extensive debate and discussion.{{sfn|Sharf|2014|p=942}}

According to Bryan Levman writing in the ''Journal of the Oxford Centre for Buddhist Studies'', "the word ''sati'' incorporates the meaning of 'memory' and 'remembrance' in much of its usage in both the ''suttas'' and the [traditional Buddhist] commentary, and... without the memory component, the notion of mindfulness cannot be properly understood or applied, as mindfulness requires memory for its effectiveness".&lt;ref name=levman17&gt;[http://www.jocbs.org/index.php/jocbs/article/view/167 Bryan Levman (2017)], p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to Robert Sharf, ''smṛti'' originally meant "to remember," "to recollect," "to bear in mind," as in the Vedic tradition of remembering the sacred texts. The term ''sati'' also means "to remember." In the ''Satipaṭṭhāna-sutta'' the term ''sati'' means to remember the [[dharma]]s, whereby the true nature of phenomena can be seen.{{sfn|Sharf|2014|p=942}} Sharf refers to the [[Milindapañha]], which explained that the arisement of ''sati'' calls to mind the wholesome [[dhamma]]s such as the four establishings of mindfulness, the five faculties, the [[Bodhipakkhiyādhammā#Five powers|five powers]], the seven awakening-factors, the noble eight-factored path, and the attainment of insight.{{sfn|Sharf|2014|pp=942–43}} According to Rupert Gethin, 
{{quote|[''sati''] should be understood as what allows awareness of the full range and extent of ''dhammas''; ''sati'' is an awareness of things in relation to things, and hence an awareness of their relative value. Applied to the ''satipaṭṭhānas'', presumably what this means is that ''sati'' is what causes the practitioner of yoga to "remember" that any feeling he may experience exists in relation to a whole variety or world of feelings that may be skillful or unskillful, with faults or faultless, relatively inferior or refined, dark or pure."{{sfn|Sharf|2014|p=943}}{{refn|group=note|Quotes from Gethin, Rupert M.L. (1992), ''The Buddhist Path to Awakening: A Study of the Bodhi-Pakkhiȳa Dhammā''. Brill's Indological Library, 7. Leiden and New York: Brill}}}}

Sharf further notes that this has little to do with "bare attention," the popular contemporary interpretation of ''sati'', "since it entails, among other things, the proper discrimination of the moral valence of phenomena as they arise."{{sfn|Sharf|2014|p=943}}

[[Georges Dreyfus]] has also expressed unease with the definition of mindfulness as "bare attention" or "nonelaborative, nonjudgmental, present-centered awareness", stressing that mindfulness in Buddhist context means also "remembering", which indicates that the function of mindfulness also includes the retention of information.&lt;ref name="Dreyfus" /&gt;{{refn|group=note|Dreyfus concludes his examination by stating: "[T]he identification of mindfulness with bare attention ignores or, at least, underestimates the cognitive implications of mindfulness, its ability to bring together various aspects of experience so as to lead to the clear comprehension of the nature of mental and bodily states. By over-emphasizing the nonjudgmental nature of mindfulness and arguing that our problems stem from conceptuality, contemporary authors are in danger of leading to a one-sided understanding of mindfulness as a form of therapeutically helpful spacious quietness. I think that it is important not to lose sight that mindfulness is not just a therapeutic technique but is a natural capacity that plays a central role in the cognitive process. It is this aspect that seems to be ignored when mindfulness is reduced to a form of nonjudgmental present-centered form of awareness of one’s experiences.&lt;ref name="Dreyfus"&gt;[http://info-buddhism.com/Mindfulness_Present-Centered_Nonjudgmental-Attention_Introspection-A-Discussion_Dreyfus.html "Is Mindfulness Present-Centered and Nonjudgmental? A Discussion of the Cognitive Dimensions of Mindfulness"] by Georges Dreyfus&lt;/ref&gt;}} Robert H. Sharf notes that Buddhist practice is aimed at the attainment of "correct view", not just "bare attention".&lt;ref group=web name="Sharf" /&gt;{{refn|group=note|Sharf: "[[Mahasi Sayadaw|Mahasi]]’s technique did not require familiarity with Buddhist doctrine (notably abhidhamma), did not require adherence to strict ethical norms (notably monasticism), and promised astonishingly quick results. This was made possible through interpreting sati as a state of "bare awareness" – the unmediated, non-judgmental perception of things "as they are," uninflected by prior psychological, social, or cultural conditioning. This notion of mindfulness is at variance with premodern Buddhist epistemologies in several respects. Traditional Buddhist practices are oriented more toward acquiring "correct view" and proper ethical discernment, rather than "no view" and a non-judgmental attitude."&lt;ref group=web name="Sharf"&gt;[http://blogs.mcgill.ca/tcpsych/tag/geoffrey-samuel/ Robert H. Sharf, ''Mindfulness or Mindlessness: Traditional and Modern Buddhist Critiques of "Bare Awareness"'']&lt;/ref&gt;}} [[Jay Garfield]], quoting [[Shantideva]] and other sources, stresses that mindfulness is constituted by the union of two functions, ''calling to mind'' and vigilantly ''retaining in mind''. He demonstrates that there is a direct connection between the practice of mindfulness and the cultivation of morality – at least in the context of Buddhism from which modern interpretations of mindfulness are stemming.&lt;ref&gt;[http://info-buddhism.com/Mindfulness-and-Morality-J-Garfield.html "Mindfulness and Ethics: Attention, Virtue and Perfection"] by Jay Garfield&lt;/ref&gt;

===Translation===
The Pali-language scholar [[Thomas William Rhys Davids]] (1843–1922) first translated ''sati'' in 1881 as English ''[[Wikt:mindfulness|mindfulness]]'' in ''sammā-sati'' "Right Mindfulness; the active, watchful mind".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=T.W. Rhys |last1=Davids |year=1881 |title=Buddhist Suttas |publisher=Clarendon Press |oclc=13247398 |page=107 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Noting that Daniel John Gogerly (1845) initially rendered ''sammā-sati'' as "Correct meditation",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gogerly |first1=D.J. |year=1845 |title=On Buddhism |journal=Journal of the Ceylon Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society |volume=1 |pages=7–28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Davids explained: 
{{quote|''sati'' is literally 'memory' but is used with reference to the constantly repeated phrase 'mindful and thoughtful' (''sato sampajâno''); and means that activity of mind and constant presence of mind which is one of the duties most frequently inculcated on the good Buddhist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=T.W. Rhys |last1=Davids |year=1881 |title=Buddhist Suttas |publisher=Clarendon Press |oclc= 13247398 |page=145 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Alternative translations===
[[John D. Dunne]] asserts that the translation of ''sati'' and  ''smṛti'' as mindfulness is confusing. A number of Buddhist scholars have started trying to establish "retention" as the preferred alternative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Lecture, Stanford University Center for Compassion and Altruism Research and Education |url= http://ccare.stanford.edu/node/21 |publisher=The Center for Compassion and Altruism Research and Education |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121120171057/http://ccare.stanford.edu/node/21 |archivedate= 2012-11-20 |date=2011 |deadurl= yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Bhikkhu Bodhi also points to the meaning of "sati" as "memory".&lt;ref name="BB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inquiringmind.com/Articles/Translator.html |title=Translator for the Buddha: An Interview with Bhikkhu Bodhi |website=www.inquiringmind.com |accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|"The word derives from a verb, sarati, meaning “to remember,” and occasionally in Pali sati is still explained in a way that connects it with the idea of memory. But when it is used in relation to meditation practice, we have no word in English that precisely captures what it refers to. An early translator cleverly drew upon the word mindfulness, which is not even in my dictionary. This has served its role admirably, but it does not preserve the connection with memory, sometimes needed to make sense of a passage.&lt;ref name="BB" /&gt;}} The terms sati/smriti have been translated as:

==Definitions==

===Psychology===
A.M. Haynes and G. Feldman have highlighted that mindfulness can be seen as a strategy that stands in contrast to a strategy of avoidance of emotion on the one hand and to the strategy of emotional overengagement on the other hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/clipsy/bph080 |title=Clarifying the Construct of Mindfulness in the Context of Emotion Regulation and the Process of Change in Therapy |journal=Clinical Psychology: Science and Practice |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=255–62 |year=2004 |last1=Hayes |first1=A.M |citeseerx= 10.1.1.168.5070 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mindfulness can also be viewed as a means to develop self-knowledge and wisdom.&lt;ref name="Karunamuni2017"/&gt;

====Trait, state and practice====
According to Brown, Ryan, and Creswell, definitions of mindfulness are typically selectively interpreted based on who is studying it and how it is applied. Some have viewed mindfulness as a mental state, while others have viewed it as a set of skills and techniques.&lt;ref name="Brown et al 2007"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/10478400701598298 |title=Mindfulness: Theoretical Foundations and Evidence for its Salutary Effects |journal=Psychological Inquiry |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=211–37 |year=2007 |last1=Brown |first1=Kirk Warren |last2=Ryan |first2= Richard M |last3=Creswell |first3=J. David }}&lt;/ref&gt; A distinction can also be made between the ''state'' of mindfulness and the ''trait'' of mindfulness.{{sfn|Gehart|2012|pp=7–8}}

According to David S. Black, whereas "mindfulness" originally was associated with esoteric beliefs and religion, and "a capacity attainable only by certain people",{{sfn|Black|2011|p=1}} scientific researchers have translated the term into measurable terms, providing a valid operational definition of mindfulness.{{sfn|Black|2011|p=2}}{{refn|group=note|Black: "[S]everal decades of research methodology and scientific discovery have defrayed these myths; mindfulness is now widely considered to be an inherent quality of human consciousness. That is, a capacity of attention and awareness oriented to the present moment that varies in degree within and between individuals, and can be assessed empirically and independent of religious, spiritual, or cultural beliefs.{{sfn|Black|2011|p=1}}}} Black mentions three possible domains:{{sfn|Black|2011|p=2}}
# A trait, a dispositional characteristic (a relatively long lasting trait),{{sfn|Black|2011|p=2}} a person's tendency to more frequently enter into and more easily abide in mindful states;{{sfn|Gehart|2012|p=7}}
# A state, an outcome (a state of awareness resulting from mindfulness training),{{sfn|Black|2011|p=2}} being in a state of present-moment awareness;{{sfn|Gehart|2012|p=7}}
# A practice (mindfulness meditation practice itself).{{refn|group=note|"Mindfulness meditation" may refer to either the secular, western practice of mindfulness,{{sfn|Zgierska|2009}} or to modern Buddhist [[Vipassana|Vipassana-meditation]].{{sfn|Didonna|2008|p=27}}{{sfn|Kristeller|2007|p=393}}{{sfn|Germer|2005|p=15}}}}

=====Trait-like constructs=====
According to Brown, mindfulness is:
{{quote|A quality of consciousness manifest in, but not isomorphic with, the activities through which it is enhanced."&lt;ref name="Brown et al 2007"/&gt;}}

Several mindfulness measures have been developed which are based on self-reporting of trait-like constructs:{{sfn|Hick|2010|p=10}}
* [https://ppc.sas.upenn.edu/resources/questionnaires-researchers/mindful-attention-awareness-scale Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS)]
* Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory (FMI)
* Kentucky Inventory of Mindfulness Skills (KIMS)
* Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale (CAMS)
* Mindfulness Questionnaire (MQ)
* Revised Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale (CAMS-R)
* Philadelphia Mindfulness Scale (PHLMS)

=====State-like phenomenon=====
According to Bishop, et alia, mindfulness is, "A kind of nonelaborative, nonjudgmental, present-centered awareness in which each thought, feeling, or sensation that arises in the attentional field is acknowledged and accepted as it is."&lt;ref name="bishopetal2004"/&gt;

* The Toronto Mindfulness Scale (TMS) measures mindfulness as a state-like phenomenon, that is evoked and maintained by regular practice.{{sfn|Hick|2010|p=10}}
* The State Mindfulness Scale (SMS) is a 21-item survey with an overall state mindfulness scale, and 2 sub-scales (state mindfulness of mind, and state mindfulness of body).&lt;ref name="Tanay"&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1037/a0034044 |pmid=24059475 |title= State Mindfulness Scale (SMS): Development and initial validation |journal= Psychological Assessment |volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=1286–99 |year=2013 |last1=Tanay |first1=Galia |last2= Bernstein |first2=Amit }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mindfulness-practice====
Mindfulness as a practice is described as:
* "Mindfulness is a way of paying attention that originated in Eastern meditation practices"&lt;ref&gt;Marlatt &amp; Kristeller, 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;68&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Paying attention in a particular way: on purpose, in the present moment, and nonjudgmentally"&lt;ref name="Baer defines2"/&gt;
* "Bringing one’s complete attention to the present experience on a moment-to-moment basis"&lt;ref name="Baer defines2" /&gt;

According to Steven F. Hick, mindfulness practice involves both formal and informal meditation practices, and nonmeditation-based exercises.{{sfn|Hick|2010|p=6}} Formal mindfulness, or meditation, is the practice of sustaining attention on body, breath or sensations, or whatever arises in each moment.{{sfn|Hick|2010|p=6}} Informal mindfulness is the application of mindful attention in everyday life.{{sfn|Hick|2010|p=6}} Nonmeditation-based exercises are specifically used in dialectical behavior therapy and in [[acceptance and commitment therapy]]. {{sfn|Hick|2010|p=6}}

====Two-component model====
In a paper that described a consensus among [[Clinical psychology|clinical psychologists]] on an operational and testable definition, Bishop, Lau, et al. (2004)&lt;ref name="bishopetal2004"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/clipsy.bph077 |title=Mindfulness: A Proposed Operational Definition |journal= Clinical Psychology: Science and Practice |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=230–41 |year=2006 |last1=Bishop |first1=Scott R. |last2=Lau |first2=Mark |last3=Shapiro |first3=Shauna |last4=Carlson |first4=Linda |last5= Anderson |first5=Nicole D. |last6=Carmody |first6=James |last7=Segal |first7=Zindel V. |last8=Abbey |first8=Susan |last9=Speca |first9=Michael |last10=Velting |first10=Drew |last11=Devins |first11=Gerald |citeseerx= 10.1.1.168.6212 }}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a two-component model of mindfulness: 
{{quote|The first component involves the self-regulation of attention so that it is maintained on immediate experience, thereby allowing for increased recognition of mental events in the present moment. The second component involves adopting a particular orientation toward one’s experiences in the present moment, an orientation that is characterized by curiosity, openness, and acceptance.&lt;ref name="bishopetal2004" /&gt;{{rp|232}}}}

In this two-component model, self-regulated attention (the first component) "involves bringing [[awareness]] to current experience - observing and attending to the changing fields of "objects" (thoughts, feelings, sensations), from moment to moment – by regulating the focus of attention". Orientation to experience (the second component) involves maintaining an attitude of curiosity about objects experienced at each moment, and about where and how the mind wanders when it drifts from the selected focus of attention. Clients are asked to avoid trying to produce a particular state (e.g. relaxation), but rather to just notice each object that arises in the [[Stream of consciousness (psychology)|stream of consciousness]].&lt;ref name="bishopetal2004" /&gt;{{rp|233}}

====The five-aggregate model====
An ancient model of the mind, generally known as the five-aggregate model&lt;ref name="Aggregates"/&gt; enables one to understand the moment-to-moment manifestation of subjective conscious experience, and therefore can be a potentially useful theoretical resource to guide mindfulness interventions.

The five aggregates are described as follows:
# ''Material form:'' includes both the physical body and external matter where material elements are continuously moving to and from the material body.
# ''Feelings:'' can be pleasant, unpleasant or neutral.
# ''Perceptions:'' represent being aware of attributes of an object (e.g. color, shape, etc.)
# ''Volition:'' represents bodily, verbal, or psychological behavior.
# ''Sensory consciousness:'' refers to input from the five senses (seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting or touch sensations) or a thought that happen to arise in the mind.

This model describes how sensory consciousness results in the generation of feelings, perception or volition, and how individuals’ previously conditioned attitudes and past associations influence this generation. The five aggregates are described as constantly arising and ceasing in the present moment.&lt;ref name="Aggregates"/&gt;

====Cultivating self-knowledge and wisdom====
The practice of mindfulness can be utilized to gradually develop self-knowledge and wisdom.&lt;ref name="Karunamuni2017"/&gt; In this regard, Buddhist teachings provide detailed instructions on how one can carry out an inquiry into the nature of the mind, and this guidance can help one to make sense of one’s subjective experience. This could include understanding what the “present moment” is, how various thoughts, etc., arise following input from the senses, the conditioned nature of thoughts, and other realizations.&lt;ref name="Karunamuni2017"/&gt; In Buddhist teachings, ultimate wisdom refers to gaining deep insight into all phenomena or “seeing things as they are.”&lt;ref name="Bhikkhu Bodhi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Karunamuni2017"/&gt;

===Definitions arising in modern teaching of meditation===
Since the 1970s, most books on meditation use definitions of mindfulness similar to [[Jon Kabat-Zinn]]'s definition as "present moment awareness".  However, recently a number of teachers of meditation have proposed quite different definitions of mindfulness.  [[Shinzen Young]] says a person is mindful when they have mindful awareness, and defines that to be when "concentration power, sensory clarity, and equanimity [are] working together."&lt;ref&gt;From 'See, Hear, Feel: An Introduction', draft 1.8., https://www.shinzen.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SeeHearFeelIntroduction_ver1.8.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  [[John Yates (Culadasa)]] defines mindfulness to be "the optimal interaction between attention and peripheral awareness", where he distinguishes attention and peripheral awareness as two distinct modes in which one may be conscious of things.&lt;ref&gt;p. 30, ''The Mind Illuminated'', Culadasa with Immergut and Graves, Hay House, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other usages===
The English term ''mindfulness'' already existed before it came to be used in a (western) Buddhist context. It was first recorded as ''myndfulness'' in 1530 ([[John Palsgrave]] translates French ''[[:wikt:pensée|pensée]]''), as ''mindfulnesse'' in 1561, and ''mindfulness'' in 1817. [[Morphology (linguistics) |Morphologically]] earlier terms include ''mindful'' (first recorded in 1340), ''mindfully'' (1382), and the obsolete ''mindiness'' (c. 1200).&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'', 2nd ed., 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, mindfulness may also refer to "a state of being aware".&lt;ref group=web name="MW"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/thesaurus/mindfulness|title=Thesaurus results for 'Mindfulness' |website= www.merriam-webster.com |accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Synonyms for this "state of being aware" are [[Wakefulness#Mindfulness |wakefulness]],{{sfn|Kabat-Zin|2011|pp=22–23}}{{sfn|Kabat-Zin|2013|p=65}} [[attention]],&lt;ref group=web&gt;{{cite web |url= http://dico.isc.cnrs.fr/dico/en/search?b=1&amp;r=mindfulness&amp;send=Look+it+up|title=Component Selection for 'mindfulness' |website= dico.isc.cnrs.fr |accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; alertness,&lt;ref group=web name="TC"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://thesaurus.com/browse/mindfulness|title=I found great synonyms for "mindfulness" on the new Thesaurus.com! |website= www.thesaurus.com |accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; prudence,&lt;ref group=web name="TC" /&gt; conscientiousness,&lt;ref group=web name="TC" /&gt; awareness,&lt;ref group=web name="MW" /&gt; consciousness,&lt;ref group=web name="MW" /&gt; and observation.&lt;ref group=web name="MW" /&gt;

==Historical development==

===Buddhism===
Mindfulness as a modern, Western practice is founded on [[Zen]] and [[Vipassana movement|modern vipassana]],{{R|"Nisbet"}}&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt;{{refn|group=note|Vipassana as taught by teachers from the [[Vipassana movement]] is a 19th century development, inspired by and reacting against Western modernism.{{sfn|McMahan|2008}}{{sfn|Sharf|1995-B}} See also [[Buddhist modernism]].}} and involves the training of sati, which means "moment to moment awareness of present events", but also "remembering to be aware of something".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mindandlife.org/dialogues/past-conferences/ml18 |title=The 18th Mind and Life Dialogues meeting |publisher=|accessdate=7 January 2018 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140322013413/http://www.mindandlife.org/dialogues/past-conferences/ml18/ |archivedate=22 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

====Early Buddhism====
''Sati'' is one of the [[bojjhanga|seven factors of enlightenment]]. "Correct" or "right" mindfulness (Pali: ''sammā-sati'', Sanskrit ''samyak-smṛti'') is the seventh element of the [[noble eightfold path]]. Mindfulness is an antidote to delusion and is considered as a 'power' (Pali: ''[[Five Strengths|bala]]'') which contributes to the attainment of ''[[nirvana]]''. This faculty becomes a power in particular when it is coupled with [[sampajañña|clear comprehension]] of whatever is taking place. Nirvana is a state of being in which greed, hatred and [[Avidya (Buddhism)|delusion]] (Pali: ''moha'') have been overcome and abandoned, and are absent from the mind.

According to Paul Williams, referring to Erich Frauwallner, mindfulness provided the way in early Buddhism to liberation, "constantly watching sensory experience in order to prevent the arising of cravings which would power future experience into rebirths."{{sfn|Williams|2000|p=46}}{{refn|group=note|name="Frauwallner"|Frauwallner, E. (1973), ''History of Indian Philosophy'', trans. V.M. Bedekar, Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass. Two volumes., pp.150 ff}} According to Vetter, ''[[Dhyāna in Buddhism|dhyana]]'' may have been the [[Pre-sectarian Buddhism#Contents and teachings of earliest Buddhism|original core practice of the Buddha]], which aided the maintenance of mindfulness.{{sfn|Vetter|1988}}

According to Rhys Davids, the doctrine of mindfulness is "perhaps the most important" after the [[Four Noble Truths]] and the [[Noble Eightfold Path]]. T.W. Rhys Davids viewed the teachings of Gotama as a rational technique for self-actualization and rejected a few parts of it, mainly the doctrine of rebirth, as residual superstitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rhys Davids |first1=T.W. |title= Dialogues of the Buddha, Part II |date=1959 |orig-year=1910 |publisher=Pali Text Society |location= Oxford, Great Britain |isbn=0 86013 034 7 |pages= 322–346}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Zazen====
{{Main|Zazen|Shikantaza}}

The aim of [[zazen]] is just [[sitting]], that is, suspending all judgmental thinking and letting words, ideas, images and thoughts pass by without getting involved in them.&lt;ref name="hcz2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Warner|first=Brad|authorlink=Brad Warner|title=[[Hardcore Zen|Hardcore Zen: Punk Rock, Monster Movies, &amp; the Truth about Reality]]|publisher=[[Wisdom Publications]]|pages=189–190|year=2003|isbn= 086171380X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Suzuki|first=Shunryū|authorlink=Shunryū Suzuki|title=[[Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind]]|pages=15–16|publisher=[[Shambhala Publications]]|year=2011|ISBN=978-159030849-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Contemporary ''vipassana''-meditation====
In modern ''vipassana''-meditation, as propgated by the [[Vipassana movement]], ''sati'' aids ''vipassana'', [[Wisdom in Buddhism|insight]] into the true nature of reality, namely the [[three marks of existence]], the [[impermanence]] of and the [[dukkha|unsatisfactoriness]] of every conditioned thing that exists, and [[anatta|non-self]].&lt;ref name="Karunamuni2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Analayo_2003"/&gt; With this insight, the practitioner becomes a socalled ''[[Sotāpanna]]'', a "stream-enterer", the first stage on the [[Buddhist Paths to liberation|path to liberation]].&lt;ref name="Sister Ayya Khema"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/khema/allofus.html |title=All of Us |accessdate= 2009-03-16|publisher=Access to Insight |last= Sister Ayya Khema}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bhikkhu Bodhi"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/waytoend.html |title= The Noble Eightfold Path |accessdate= 2009-03-16 |publisher= Access to Insight |last=Bhikkhu Bodhi}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|In [[Mahayana]] contexts, it entails insight into what is variously described as [[sunyata]], [[dharmata]], the inseparability of appearance and emptiness ([[two truths doctrine]]), clarity and emptiness, or bliss and emptiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Defined by Reginald A.

Vipassana is practiced in tandem with [[samatha]], and also plays a central role in other Buddhist traditions.&lt;ref name="Analayo_2003"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Anālayo |first1=Bhikku |title= Satipaṭṭhāna, the direct path to realization |date=2003 |publisher= Windhorse Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Theravada Buddhism?|url= http://www.accesstoinsight.org/theravada.html|work=Access to Insight |publisher= Access to Insight |accessdate=17 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the contemporary Theravada orthodoxy, samatha is used as a preparation for vipassanā, pacifying the mind and strengthening the concentration in order to allow the work of insight, which leads to [[Enlightenment in Buddhism |liberation]].

Vipassanā-meditation has gained popularity in the west through the modern Buddhist vipassana movement, modeled after Theravāda Buddhism meditation practices,{{sfn|McMahan}} which employs vipassanā and [[anapana|ānāpāna]] meditation as its primary techniques and places emphasis on the teachings of the {{IAST|Satipaṭṭhāna}} Sutta.

=====Anapanasati, satipaṭṭhāna, and vipassana=====
[[Anapanasati]] is mindfulness of breathing. "Sati" means [[Mindfulness (Buddhism) |mindfulness]]; "ānāpāna" refers to inhalation and exhalation. Anapanasati means to feel the sensations caused by the movements of the breath in the body. The ''Anapanasati Sutta'' gives an exposition on this practice.{{refn|group=note|[[Majjhima Nikaya]] (MN), sutta number 118. See [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.118.than.html Thanissaro, 2006]. Other discourses which describe the full four tetrads can be found in the [[Samyutta Nikaya]]'s ''Anapana-samyutta'' (Ch. 54), such as SN 54.6 (Thanissaro, 2006a), SN 54.8 (Thanissaro, 2006b) and SN 54.13 (Thanissaro, 1995a). The one-tetrad exposition of anapanasati is found, for instance, in the ''Kayagata-sati Sutta'' ([[Majjhima Nikaya|MN]] 119; Thanissaro, 1997), the ''Maha-satipatthana Sutta'' ([[Digha Nikaya|DN]] 22; Thanissaro, 2000) and the ''[[Satipatthana Sutta]]'' (MN 10; Thanissaro, 1995b).}}

[[Satipaṭṭhāna]] is the establishment of mindfulness in one's day-to-day life, maintaining as much as possible a calm awareness of one's body, feelings, mind, and [[dharma]]s. The practice of mindfulness supports analysis resulting in the arising of wisdom (Pali: ''paññā'', Sanskrit: ''prajñā'').&lt;ref name="Analayo_2003"/&gt;

=====''Samprajaña'', ''apramāda'' and ''atappa''=====
In contemporary Theravada practice, "mindfulness" also includes ''samprajaña'', meaning "clear comprehension" and ''apramāda'' meaning "vigilance".&lt;ref name="Subhuti"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://madhyamavani.fwbo.org/8/mindfulness.html |title=Friends of the Western Buddhist Order (FWBO): Buddhism and Mindfulness |first= |last=Satyadarshin |website= madhyamavani.fwbo.org |accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|[I]n Buddhist discourse, there are three terms that together map the field of mindfulness [...] [in their Sanskrit variants] ''smṛti'' (Pali: ''sati''), ''samprajaña'' (Pali: ''[[Sampajañña]]'')  and ''[[apramāda]]'' (Pali: ''appamada'').&lt;ref name="Subhuti" /&gt;}} All three terms are sometimes (confusingly) translated as "mindfulness", but they all have specific shades of meaning.

In a publicly available correspondence between [[Bhikkhu Bodhi]] and [[B. Alan Wallace]], Bodhi has described Ven. [[Nyanaponika Thera]]'s views on "right mindfulness" and sampajañña as follows:
{{quote|He held that in the proper practice of right mindfulness, sati has to be integrated with sampajañña, clear comprehension, and it is only when these two work together that right mindfulness can fulfill its intended purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://shamatha.org/sites/default/files/Bhikkhu_Bodhi_Correspondence.pdf |title="The Nature of Mindfulness and Its Role in Buddhist Meditation" A Correspondence between B.A. wallace and the Venerable Bikkhu Bodhi, Winter 2006, p.4 |publisher= |accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note| According to this correspondence, Ven. Nyanaponika spend his last ten years living with and being cared for by Bodhi. Bodhi refers to Nyanaponika as "my closest kalyāṇamitta in my life as a monk."}}}}

====Monitoring mental processes====
According to Buddhadasa, the aim of mindfulness is to stop the arising of disturbing thoughts and emotions, which arise from sense-contact.{{sfn|Buddhadasa Bhikkhu|2014|p=79, 101, 117 note 42}}

According to Grzegorz Polak, the four ''upassanā'' (foundations of mindfulness) have been misunderstood by the developing Buddhist tradition, including Theravada, to refer to four different foundations. According to Polak, the four ''upassanā'' do not refer to four different foundations, but to the awareness of four different aspects of raising mindfulness:{{sfn|Polak|2011}}
* the [[Ayatana|six sense-bases]] which one needs to be aware of (''kāyānupassanā''); 
* contemplation on [[vedanā]]s, which arise with the contact between the senses and their objects (''vedanānupassanā'');
* the altered states of mind to which this practice leads (cittānupassanā);
* the development from the [[five hindrances]]  to the [[seven factors of enlightenment]] (''dhammānupassanā'').}}

===Transcendentalism===
Kabat-Zinn himself refers to Thoreau as a predecessor of the interest in mindfulness, together with the other eminent [[Transcendentalism|Transcendentalists]] Emerson and Whitman:{{sfn|Kabat-Zinn|year unknown}}
{{quote|The collective experience{{refn|group=note|The resort to "experience" as the ground for religious truths is a strategy which goes back to Schleiermacher, as a defense against the growing influence of western rationality on the religious life of Europeans in the 19th century. See Sharf (1995), ''Buddhist Modernism and the Rhetoric of Meditative Experience''.{{sfn|Sharf|1995-B}}}} of sages, yogis, and Zen masters offers a view of the world which is complementary to the predominantly reductionist and materialistic one currently dominating Western thought and institutions. But this view is neither particularly "Eastern" nor mystical. Thoreau saw the same problem with our ordinary mind state in New England in 1846 and wrote with great passion about its unfortunate consequences.{{sfn|Kabat-Zinn|year unknown}}}}

The forms of Asian religion and spirituality which were introduced in the west were themselves influenced by Transcendentalism and other 19th-century manifestations of [[Western esotericism]]. Transcendentalism was closely connected to the Unitarian Church,{{sfn|Harris|2009|p=268}}&lt;ref group=web&gt;{{cite web|last1=Finseth|first1=Ian Frederick |title= The Emergence of Transcendentalism |url= http://xroads.virginia.edu/~ma95/finseth/trans.html |website= virginia.edu |publisher=The University of Virginia |accessdate= 9 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which in India collaborated with [[Ram Mohan Roy]] (1772–1833) and his [[Brahmo Samaj]].{{sfn|Harris|2009|p=268}} He found that [[Unitarianism]] came closest to true Christianity,{{sfn|Harris|2009|p=268}} and had a strong sympathy for the Unitarians.{{sfn|Kipf|1979|p=3-8}} This influence worked through on [[Vivekananda]], whose modern but idiosyncratic interpretation of Hinduism became widely popular in the west.{{sfn|King|2001}} Vipassana meditation, presented as a centuries-old meditation system, was a 19th-century reinvention,{{sfn|Wilson|2014|p=22}} which gained popularity in south-east due to the accessibility of the Buddhist sutras through English translations from the Pali Text Society.{{sfn|McMahan|2008}} It was brought to western attention in the 19th century by the [[Theosophical Society]].{{sfn|McMahan|2008}}{{sfn|Wilson|2014|p=17}} Zen Buddhism first gained popularity in the west through the writings of [[D.T.

===Jon Kabat-Zinn and MBSR===
In 1979, [[Jon Kabat-Zinn]] founded the [[Mindfulness-based stress reduction|Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction]] (MBSR) program at the [[University of Massachusetts]] to treat the chronically ill.&lt;ref&gt;"The Stress Reduction Program, founded by Dr. Jon Kabat-Zinn in 1979..." - http://www.umassmed.edu/cfm/stress/index.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; This program sparked the application of mindfulness ideas and practices in Medicine&lt;ref&gt;"Much of the interest in the clinical applications of mindfulness has been sparked by the introduction of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR), a manualized treatment program originally developed for the management of chronic pain (Kabat-Zinn, 1982; Kabat-Zinn, Lipworth, &amp; Burney, 1985; Kabat-Zinn, Lipworth, Burney, &amp; Sellers, 1987)." - Bishop et al, 2004, "Mindfulness: A Proposed Operational Definition"&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|230–1}} for the treatment of a variety of conditions in both healthy and unhealthy people. MBSR and similar programs are now widely applied in schools, prisons, hospitals, veterans centers, and other environments.

Mindfulness practices were inspired mainly by teachings from the [[Eastern World]], particularly from Buddhist traditions. Kabat-Zinn himself was first introduced to meditation by [[Philip Kapleau]], a [[Zen]] missionary who came to speak at MIT where Kabat-Zinn was a student. Kabat-Zinn went on to study meditation with other Zen-Buddhist teachers such as [[Thích Nhất Hạnh]] and [[Seungsahn]].&lt;ref name=Wilson&gt;{{cite book |first=Jeff |last=Wilson |title=Mindful America: The Mutual Transformation of Buddhist Meditation and American Culture |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2014 |page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also studied at the [[Insight Meditation Society]] and eventually taught there.&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt;One of MBSR's techniques - the "body scan" - was derived from a meditation practice ("sweeping") of the Burmese [[U Ba Khin]] tradition, as taught by [[S. N. Goenka]] in his [[Vipassana]] retreats, which he began in 1976. It has since been widely adapted in secular settings, independent of religious or cultural contexts.{{refn|group=note|name="jama.ama-assn.org"|"Historically a Buddhist practice, mindfulness can be considered a universal human capacity proposed to foster clear thinking and open-heartedness. As such, this form of meditation requires no particular religious or cultural belief system." - Mindfulness in Medicine by Ludwig and Kabat-Zinn, available at [http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/short/300/11/1350 jama.ama-assn.org]}}{{refn|group=note|"Kabat-Zinn (2000) suggests that mindfulness practice may be beneficial to many people in Western society who might be unwilling to adopt Buddhist traditions or vocabulary.

===Popularization, "mindfulness movement"===
Mindfulness is gaining a growing popularity as a practice in daily life, apart from Buddhist insight meditation and its application in clinical psychology.&lt;ref name=Time2014/&gt; In this context mindfulness is defined as moment-by-moment awareness of thoughts, feelings, bodily sensations, and surrounding environment, characterized mainly by "acceptance" - attention to thoughts and feelings without judging whether they are right or wrong. Mindfulness focuses the human brain on what is being sensed at each moment, instead of on its normal [[Rumination (psychology) |rumination]] on the past or on the future.&lt;ref name="What Is Mindfulness"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/topic/mindfulness/definition |title= What Is Mindfulness?|website= The Greater Good Science Center |publisher= The Greater Good Science Center at the University of California, Berkeley |accessdate= 2014-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Mindfulness'' may be seen as a mode of being,&lt;ref name="Israel"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ira-israel/types-of-mindfulness_b_3347428.html |title= What's the Difference Between Mindfulness, Mindfulness Meditation and Basic Meditation? |website= The Huffington Post |date= 30 May 2013 |last= Israel |first= Ira}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can be practiced outside a formal setting.&lt;ref name="Bernhard"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/turning-straw-gold/201106/6-benefits-practicing-mindfulness-outside-meditation |title= 6 Benefits of Practicing Mindfulness Outside of Meditation |date= 6 Jun 2011 |website= Psychology Today |last= Bernhard |first= Toni}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terminology used by scholars of religion, scientists, journalists, and popular media writers to describe this movement of mindfulness "popularization," and the many new contexts of mindfulness practice which have cropped up, has regularly evolved over the past 20 years, with some criticisms arising.&lt;ref name="Valerio 1–27"&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1080/14639947.2016.1162425 |title= Owning Mindfulness: A Bibliometric Analysis of Mindfulness Literature Trends Within and Outside of Buddhist Contexts |journal= Contemporary Buddhism |volume=17 |pages= 157–83 |year=2016 |last1= Valerio |first1=Adam }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Therapy programs===

====Mindfulness-based stress reduction====
{{Main article|Mindfulness-based stress reduction}}

Mindfulness-based stress reduction ('''MBSR''') is a mindfulness-based program&lt;ref name=MBSRwebsite&gt;{{cite web |title= What is Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction? |publisher= Mindful Living Programs |url=http://www.mindfullivingprograms.com/whatMBSR.php |accessdate=April 15, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060718065653/http://www.mindfullivingprograms.com/whatMBSR.php |archivedate= July 18, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; developed by Jon Kabat-Zinn at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center, which uses a combination of mindfulness meditation, body awareness, and [[Yoga as exercise or alternative medicine|yoga]] to help people become more mindful.&lt;ref name=" Kabat-Zinn_2013"/&gt; While MBSR has its roots in spiritual teachings, the program itself is [[Secularism|secular]].&lt;ref name="Kabat-Zinn_2013"/&gt;

====Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy====
{{Main article|Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy}}

Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is a [[psychological therapy]] designed to aid in preventing the relapse of depression, specifically in individuals with [[Major depressive disorder]] (MDD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2011.05.002 |pmid= 21802618 |title=The effect of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for prevention of relapse in recurrent major depressive disorder: A systematic review and meta-analysis |journal= Clinical Psychology Review |volume=31 |issue=6 |pages= 1032–40 |year=2011 |last1=Piet |first1=Jacob |last2= Hougaard |first2=Esben }}&lt;/ref&gt; It uses traditional [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT) methods and adds in newer psychological strategies such as mindfulness and mindfulness meditation. Cognitive methods can include educating the participant about depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1016/j.jad.2010.09.027 |pmid=21093925 |title= Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy vs cognitive behaviour therapy as a treatment for non-melancholic depression |journal= Journal of Affective Disorders |volume=130 |issue=1–2 |pages=138–44 |year=2011 |last1= Manicavasgar |first1= Vijaya |last2=Parker |first2=Gordon |last3=Perich |first3=Tania }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mindfulness and mindfulness meditation, focus on becoming aware of all incoming thoughts and feelings and accepting them, but not attaching or reacting to them.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect"&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1016/j.psc.2010.04.006 |pmid=20599141 |pmc=2898899 |title=The Empirical Status of the "New Wave" of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy |journal= Psychiatric Clinics of North America |volume= 33 |issue=3 |pages=701–10 |year=2010 |last1= Hofmann |first1=Stefan G |last2=Sawyer |first2= Alice T |last3=Fang |first3=Angela }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like CBT, MBCT functions on the theory that when individuals who have historically had depression become distressed, they return to automatic cognitive processes that can trigger a depressive episode.&lt;ref name="Felder"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/jclp.21832 |pmid=23616298 |title= Collaboration in Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy |journal=Journal of Clinical Psychology |volume=68 |issue=2 |pages=179–86 |year=2012 |last1=Felder |first1=Jennifer N |last2= Dimidjian |first2=Sona |last3=Segal |first3=Zindel }}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of MBCT is to interrupt these automatic processes and teach the participants to focus less on reacting to incoming stimuli, and instead accepting and observing them without judgment.&lt;ref name="Felder" /&gt; This mindfulness practice allows the participant to notice when automatic processes are occurring and to alter their reaction to be more of a reflection. 
Research supports the effects of MBCT in people who have been depressed three or more times and demonstrates reduced relapse rates by 50%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1037/0022-006x.72.1.31 |pmid=14756612 |title= Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for Depression: Replication and Exploration of Differential Relapse Prevention Effects |journal= Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology |volume=72 |issue=1 |pages=31–40 |year=2004 |last1=Ma |first1=S.

====Acceptance and commitment therapy====
{{Main article|Acceptance and commitment therapy}}

Acceptance and commitment therapy or (ACT) (typically pronounced as the word "act") is a form of [[clinical behavior analysis]] (CBA)&lt;ref name="Plumb"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid= 22478515 |pmc=2686995 |year=2009 |author1= Plumb |first1=J.

====Dialectical behavior therapy====
Mindfulness is a "core" exercise used in [[dialectical behavior therapy]] (DBT), a psychosocial treatment [[Marsha M. Linehan]] developed for treating people with [[borderline personality disorder]]. DBT is [[dialectic]], explains Linehan,&lt;ref&gt;Linehan 1993, p.19&lt;/ref&gt; in the sense of "the reconciliation of opposites in a continual process of synthesis." As a practitioner of Buddhist meditation techniques, Linehan says:
{{quote|This emphasis in DBT on a balance of acceptance and change owes much to my experiences in studying meditation and Eastern spirituality. The DBT tenets of observing, mindfulness, and avoidance of judgment are all derived from the study and practice of Zen meditations.&lt;ref&gt;Linehan 1993, p.20-21&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Mode deactivation therapy====
[[Mode deactivation therapy]] (MDT) is a treatment methodology that is derived from the principles of cognitive behavioral therapy and incorporates elements of Acceptance and commitment therapy, Dialectical behavior therapy, and mindfulness techniques.&lt;ref name=MDT_Book&gt;{{Cite book |vauthors=Apsche JA, DiMeo L |title= Mode Deactivation Therapy for aggression and oppositional behavior in adolescents: An integrative methodology using ACT, DBT, and CBT |year=2010 |publisher= New Harbinger |location= Oakland, CA  |isbn= 978-1608821075}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mindfulness techniques such as simple breathing exercises are applied to assist the client in awareness and non-judgmental acceptance of unpleasant and distressing thoughts and feelings as they occur in the present moment. Mode Deactivation Therapy was developed and is established as an effective treatment for adolescents with problem behaviors and complex trauma-related psychological problems, according to recent publications by [[Jack A.

Since 2006, research supports promising mindfulness-based therapies for a number of medical and psychiatric conditions, notably [[chronic pain]] (McCracken et al. 2007), [[Stress (biological)|stress]] (Grossman et al. 2004), anxiety and depression (Hofmann et al. 2010), [[substance abuse]] (Melemis 2008:141-157), and recurrent [[suicidal behavior]] (Williams et al. 2006). Bell (2009) gives a brief overview of mindful approaches to therapy, particularly [[family therapy]], starting with a discussion of [[mysticism]] and emphasizing the value of a mindful therapist.

;Morita therapy
The Japanese psychiatrist [[Shoma Morita]], who trained in Zen meditation, developed [[Morita therapy]] upon principles of mindfulness and non-attachment. Since the beginnings of [[Gestalt therapy]] in the early 1940s, mindfulness, referred to as "awareness", has been an essential part of its theory and practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Gestalt theory concepts |url= http://www.gestalttheory.com/concepts |accessdate= 25 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Schools===
In 2012 Congressman [[Tim Ryan (politician)|Tim Ryan]] of Ohio published ''A Mindful Nation'', and has received a $1 million federal grant to teach mindfulness in schools in his home district.&lt;ref name=Time2014/&gt;

[[Mindful Kids Miami, Inc.(MKM)]] is a tax-exempt, 501 (c)(3), non-profit corporation established in 2011 and dedicated to making age-appropriate mindfulness training available to school children in Miami-Dade County public and private schools. This is primarily accomplished by training educators and other child care providers to incorporate mindfulness practices in the children’s daily activities.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.Mindfulkidsmiami.org&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, [[Susan Kaiser Greenland#Work|The Inner Kids Program]], a mindfulness-based program developed for children, was introduced into public and private school curricula in the greater Los Angeles area.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.susankaisergreenland.com/inner-kids.html&lt;/ref&gt;

MindUP, a classroom-based program spearheaded by [[Goldie Hawn]]'s Hawn Foundation, teaches students to self-regulate behavior and mindfully engage in focused concentration required for academic success. For the last decade, MindUP has trained teachers in over 1,000 schools in cities from Arizona to Washington.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://thehawnfoundation.org/mindup/ |title= MindUP™ |accessdate=2015-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Holistic Life Foundation, a non-profit organization that created an in-school mindfulness program called Mindful Moment, is currently serving almost 350 students daily at Robert W. Coleman Elementary School and approximately 1300 students at Patterson Park High School in Baltimore, Maryland. At Patterson High School, the Mindful Moment program engages the school's faculty along with the students during a 15-minute mindfulness practice at the beginning and end of each school day.

Mindful Life Project, a non-profit 501(c)3 based out of Richmond, California, teaches mindfulness to elementary school students in underserved schools in the South Richmond school district. Utilizing curriculum, “Rise-Up” is a regular school day intervention program serving 430 students weekly, while “Mindful Community” is currently implemented at six South Richmond partner schools. These in-school mindfulness programs have been endorsed by Richmond Mayor Gayle McLaughlin, who has recommended additional funding to expand the program in order to serve all Richmond youth.

=== Education ===
Mindfulness practices are becoming more common within educational institutions including [[Elementary school (United States)|Elementary]] and [[Secondary school|Secondary]] schools. This has been referred to as part of a 'contemplative turn' in education that has emerged since the turn of the millennium.&lt;ref name="Ergas &amp; Todd"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Oren |editor1-last=Ergas |editor2-first=Sharon |editor2-last=Todd |title=Philosophy East/West: Exploring intersections between educational and contemplative practices |date=2016 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |edition=1st |isbn=978-1-119-14733-6 }}{{page needed|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The applications of mindfulness in schools are aimed at calming and relaxation of students as well as for students and educators to build compassion and empathy for others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1750-8606.2012.00240.x |pmid=22905038 |pmc=3420012 |title=Contemplative Practices and Mental Training: Prospects for American Education |journal=Child Development Perspectives |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=146–53 |year=2012 |last1=j.

Within educational systems, the application of mindfulness practices shows an improvement of students' attention and focus, emotional regulation, creativity, and problem solving skills.&lt;ref name="Zenner, Herrnleben-Kurz &amp; Walach 2014"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00603 |pmid=25071620 |pmc=4075476 |title=Mindfulness-based interventions in schools—a systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=Frontiers in Psychology |volume=5 |pages=603 |year=2014 |last1=Zenner |first1=Charlotte |last2=Herrnleben-Kurz |first2=Solveig |last3=Walach |first3=Harald }}&lt;/ref&gt; As discussed by Ergas and Todd, the development of this field since the turn of the millennium has brought diverse possibilities as well as complexities, given the origins of mindfulness within [[Buddhism]] and the processes of its secularization and measurement based on science.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Renshaw and Cook state, “As scientific interest in the utility of Mindfulness-Based Intervention (MBI) in schools grew steadily, popular interest in mindfulness in schools seemed to grow exponentially”.&lt;ref name="Renshaw, T. L. 2016"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/pits.21978 |title=Introduction to the Special Issue: Mindfulness in the Schools-Historical Roots, Current Status, and Future Directions |journal=Psychology in the Schools |volume=54 |pages=5–12 |year=2017 |last1=Renshaw |first1=Tyler L |last2=Cook |first2=Clayton R }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite research on mindfulness being comparatively unexamined, especially with young students, the practice has seen a spike in use within the educational arena. “A relatively recent addition to discourse around preventing school expulsion and failure, mindfulness is gaining popularity for its potential to improve students’ social, emotional, behavioral, and learning-related cognitive control, thereby improving academic outcomes”.&lt;ref name="Eklund, K. 2016"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/pits.21983 |title=Gauging Mindfulness in Children and Youth: School-Based Applications |journal=Psychology in the Schools |volume=54 |pages=101–14 |year=2017 |last1=Eklund |first1=Katie |last2=O'Malley |first2=Meagan |last3=Meyer |first3=Lauren }}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers and educators are interested in how mindfulness can provide optimal conditions for a students’ personal development and academic success. Current research on mindfulness in education is limited but can provide insight to the potential benefits for students, and areas of improvement for future studies.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Mindfulness in the classroom is being touted as a promising new intervention tool for young students. According to Choudhury and Moses, “Although still marginal and in some cases controversial, secular programs of mindfulness have been implemented with ambitious goals of improving attentional focus of pupils, social-emotional learning in “at-risk” children and youth, not least, to intervene in problems of poverty and incarceration”.&lt;ref name="Choudhury &amp; Moses 2016"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0959354316669025 |title=Mindful interventions: Youth, poverty, and the developing brain |journal=Theory &amp; Psychology |volume=26 |issue=5 |pages=591–606 |year=2016 |last1=Choudhury |first1=Suparna |last2=Moses |first2=Joshua M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Emerging research is concerned with studying teachers and programs using mindfulness practices with students, and is discovering tension arising from the moral reframing of eastern practices in western school settings. As cited by Renshaw and Cook, “Unlike most other approaches to contemporary school-based intervention, which are squarely grounded in behavioral, cognitive-behavioral, and ecological systems theories, MBIs have their origins in Eastern religious traditions”.&lt;ref name="Renshaw, T. L. 2016"/&gt; Some school administrators are concerned about implementing such practices, and parents have been reported to take their children out of mindfulness programs because of their personal religious beliefs.  Yet, MBI’s continue to be accepted by the mainstream in both primary and secondary schools because, “Mindfulness practices, particularly in relationship to children who might otherwise be considered broken or unredeemable, fill a critical niche – one that allows its advocates to imagine a world where people can change, become more compassionate, resilient, reflective, and aware; a world with a viable future”.&lt;ref name="Choudhury &amp; Moses 2016"/&gt; As mindfulness in education continues to develop, ethical consequences will remain a controversial issue because the generic description for the “benefits” and “results” of MBI’s are largely concerned with individual and inward-focused achievement, rather than the original Buddhist ideal of global human connection.

Available research reveals a relationship between mindfulness and attention. Semple, Lee, Rosa, &amp; Miller argue, “Anxiety can impair attention and promote emotionally reactive behaviors that interfere with the development of good study skills, so it seems reasonable that increased mindfulness would be associated with less anxiety”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10826-009-9301-y |title=A Randomized Trial of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for Children: Promoting Mindful Attention to Enhance Social-Emotional Resiliency in Children |journal=Journal of Child and Family Studies |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=218–29 |year=2009 |last1=Semple |first1=Randye J |last2=Lee |first2=Jennifer |last3=Rosa |first3=Dinelia |last4=Miller |first4=Lisa F }}&lt;/ref&gt; They conducted a randomized trial of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for Children (MBCT-C) that found promise in managing anxiety for elementary school-aged children, and suggests that those who completed the program displayed fewer attention problems. In addition, Flook shows how an eight-week mindfulness awareness program was evaluated in a random and controlled school setting, and measured the effects of awareness practices on executive functions in elementary school children. Their findings concluded, “Participation in the mindfulness awareness program was associated with improvements in behavioral regulation, metacognition, and overall executive functions”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/15377900903379125 |title=Effects of Mindful Awareness Practices on Executive Functions in Elementary School Children |journal=Journal of Applied School Psychology |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=70–95 |year=2010 |last1=Flook |first1=Lisa |last2=Smalley |first2=Susan L |last3=Kitil |first3=M.

These perspectives are a valuable source of data given that caregivers and educators interact with the children daily and across a variety of settings. According to Eklund, Omalley, and Meyer, “School-based practitioners should find promise in the evidence supporting mindfulness-based practices with children, parents, and educators”.&lt;ref name="Eklund, K. 2016"/&gt; Lastly, a third study by Zenner, Herrnleben-Kurz, and Walach concluded, “Analysis suggest that mindfulness-based interventions for children and youths are able to increase cognitive capacity of attending and learning by nearly one standard deviation and yield”.&lt;ref name="Zenner, Herrnleben-Kurz &amp; Walach 2014"/&gt; Application of Mindfulness-Based Interventions continue to increase in popularity and practice.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Mindfulness-Based Interventions are rising across western culture, but its effectiveness in school programs is still being determined. Research contends, “Mindfulness-based approaches for adults are effective at enhancing mental health, but few controlled trials have evaluated their effectiveness among young people”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1192/bjp.bp.113.126649 |pmid=23787061 |title=Effectiveness of the Mindfulness in Schools Programme: Non-randomised controlled feasibility study |journal=The British Journal of Psychiatry |volume=203 |issue=2 |pages=126–31 |year=2013 |last1=Kuyken |first1=W |last2=Weare |first2=K |last3=Ukoumunne |first3=O.

A firmly controlled experiment, Johnson, Burke, Brinkman, and Wade evaluated “the impact of an existing and widely available school-based mindfulness program, no improvements were demonstrated on any outcome measured either immediately post intervention or at three-month follow-up”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.brat.2016.03.002 |pmid=27054828 |title=Effectiveness of a school-based mindfulness program for transdiagnostic prevention in young adolescents |journal=Behaviour Research and Therapy |volume=81 |pages=1–11 |year=2016 |last1=Johnson |first1=Catherine |last2=Burke |first2=Christine |last3=Brinkman |first3=Sally |last4=Wade |first4=Tracey }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many questions remain on which practices best implement effective and reliable mindfulness programs at schools, and further research is needed to identify the optimal methods and measurement tools for mindfulness in education.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Mindfulness has gained increasing empirical attention since 1970.&lt;ref name="Harrington2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; According to a 2015 [[systematic review]] and [[meta-analysis]] of systematic reviews of [[Randomized controlled trial|RCT]]s (that included a combined total of 8683 participants consisting of different patient categories as well as healthy adults and children), evidence supports the use of mindfulness programs to alleviate symptoms of a variety of [[mental disorder|mental]] and physical disorders.&lt;ref name="Gotink"/&gt; Other reviews report similar findings.&lt;ref name="Sharma"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Garland"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sequeira"/&gt;

However, this study included a highly heterogeneous group of meditation styles (i.e., it did not focus exclusively on mindfulness meditation), which is a significant limitation of this study.

==Concerns and criticism==

===Scholarly research===
Many of the above cited review studies however also indicate the necessity for more high-quality research in this field such as conducting intervention studies using larger sample sizes, the use of more randomized controlled studies and the need for providing more methodological details in reported studies.&lt;ref name="Creswell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Keng2011"/&gt; There are also a few review studies that have found little difference between mindfulness interventions and control groups, though they did also indicate that their intervention group was treated too shortly for the research to be conclusive.&lt;ref name= McLean2017 &gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1186/s12883-017-0876-4 |pmid=28506263 |pmc=5433018 |title=Mindfulness-based stress reduction in Parkinson's disease: A systematic review |journal=BMC Neurology |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=92 |year=2017 |last1=McLean |first1=G |last2=Lawrence |first2=M |last3=Simpson |first3=R |last4=Mercer |first4=S.

Various scholars have criticized how mindfulness has been defined or represented in recent western psychology publications.&lt;ref name="bishopetal2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wallace06"&gt;{{cite book |title=The attention revolution: Unlocking the power of the focused mind |last=Wallace |first=B.

These modern understandings depart significantly from the accounts of mindfulness in early Buddhist texts and authoritative commentaries in the Theravada and Indian Mahayana traditions.&lt;ref name="wallace06" /&gt;{{rp|62}}&lt;ref name="chiesa13"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s12671-012-0123-4 |title=The Difficulty of Defining Mindfulness: Current Thought and Critical Issues |journal=Mindfulness |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=255–68 |year=2012 |last1=Chiesa |first1=Alberto }}&lt;/ref&gt; Adam Valerio has introduced the idea that conflict between academic disciplines over how mindfulness is defined, understood, and popularly presented may be indicative of a personal, institutional, or paradigmatic battle for ownership over mindfulness, one where academics, researchers, and other writers are invested as individuals in much the same way as religious communities.&lt;ref name="Valerio 1–27"/&gt;

===Shortcomings===
The popularization of mindfulness as a "commodity"{{sfn|Safran|2014}} has been criticized, being termed "McMindfulness" by some critics.&lt;ref group=web name="McMindfulness"&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ron-purser/beyond-mcmindfulness_b_3519289.html Ron Purser and David Loy (2013), ''Beyond McMindfulness'', Huffington Post]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=web name="TriMc"&gt;[http://tricycle.org/trikedaily/trike-contributing-editor-david-loy-takes-mcmindfulness/ Alex Caring-Lobel (2013), ''Trike Contributing Editor David Loy takes on "McMindfulness" '', Tricycle Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Bazzano|2014}} According to Safran, the popularity of mindfulness is the result of a marketing strategy:{{sfn|Safran|2014}}
"McMindfulness is the marketing of a constructed dream; an idealized lifestyle; an identity makeover."{{sfn|Safran|2014}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/677842 |title=Creating the Responsible Consumer: Moralistic Governance Regimes and Consumer Subjectivity |year=2014 |last1=Giesler |first1=Markus|last2=Veresiu |first2=Ela |journal=Journal of Consumer Research |volume=41 |issue=October |pages=849–67 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Safran, Jeremy D., PhD.

According to Purser and Loy, mindfulness is not being used as a means to awaken to insight in the "unwholesome roots of greed, ill will and delusion,"&lt;ref group=web name="McMindfulness" /&gt; but reshaped into a "banal, therapeutic, self-help technique" that has the opposite effect of reinforcing those passions.&lt;ref group=web name="McMindfulness" /&gt; While mindfulness is marketed as a means to reduce stress, in a Buddhist context it is part of an all-embracing ethical program to foster "wise action, social harmony, and compassion."&lt;ref group=web name="McMindfulness" /&gt; The privatization of mindfulness neglects the societal and organizational causes of stress and discomfort, instead propagating adaptation to these circumstances.&lt;ref group=web name="McMindfulness" /&gt; According to Bhikkhu Bodhi, "[A]bsent a sharp social critique, Buddhist practices could easily be used to justify and stabilize the status quo, becoming a reinforcement of [[consumer capitalism]]."&lt;ref group=web name="McMindfulness" /&gt; The popularity of this new brand of mindfulness has resulted in the commercialization of meditation through self-help books, guided meditation classes, and mindfulness retreats.

Buddhist commentators have criticized the movement as being presented as equivalent to Buddhist practice, while in reality it is very possibly denatured with undesirable consequences, such as being ungrounded in the traditional reflective morality and therefore, astray from traditional Buddhist ethics. Criticisms suggest it to be either de-moralized or re-moralized into clinically based ethics. The conflict is often presented in concern to the teacher's credentials and qualifications, rather than the student's actual practice. Reformed Buddhist-influenced practices are being standardized and manualized in a clearly distinct separation from Buddhism seen as a religion based in monastic temples, as expressed as mindfulness in a new psychology ethic practiced in modern meditation centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shonin|first1=Edo|title=Buddhist Foundations of Mindfulness (Mindfulness in Behavioral Health)|date=August 27, 2015|publisher=Springer|pages=90–94|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mundaneum''' is a non profit organisation based in [[Mons]], [[Belgium]] that runs an exhibition space, website and archive which celebrate the legacy of the original Mundaneum established by [[Paul Otlet]] and [[Henri La Fontaine]] in the early twentieth century.&lt;ref name=MES&gt;{{cite web|title=Mundaneum Exhibition Space|url=http://expositions.mundaneum.org/en|website=Mundaneum|accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The '''Mundaneum''' was  created in 1910, following an initiative begun in 1895 by Belgian lawyers Paul Otlet and Henri La Fontaine,&lt;ref name="Google"&gt;{{cite news |work=New York Times |date=March 12, 2012 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/13/technology/google-to-announce-venture-with-belgian-museum.html?_r=2&amp;ref=global |title=Google to Announce Venture With Belgian Museum |author=Eric Pfanner}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of their work on [[documentation science]]. Otlet first called it the Palais Mondial, meaning "world palace" in English, and it occupied the left wing of the [[Cinquantenaire|Palais du Cinquantenaire]], a government building in Brussels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=van den Heuvel|first1=Charles|editor1-last=Rayward|editor1-first=W. Boyd|title=Information Beyond Borders: International Cultural and Intellectual Exchange in the Belle Époque|date=2016|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317116790|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5C43DAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT315&amp;dq=%22Palais%20Mondial%22%20mundaneum&amp;pg=PT315#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|chapter=Dynamics of Networks and of Decimal Classification Systems, 1905-1935}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It aimed to gather together all the world's [[knowledge]] and classify it according to a system they developed called the [[Universal Decimal Classification]]. Otlet and La Fontaine organized an International Conference of International Associations which was the origin of the [[Union of International Associations]] (UIA).

The Mundaneum has been identified as a milestone in the history of data collection and management,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = Wolfram | title = Alpha | url = http://www.wolframalpha.com/docs/timeline/computable-knowledge-history-5.html | contribution = Computable knowledge History}}&lt;/ref&gt; and (somewhat more tenuously) as a precursor to the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = OUP USA| isbn = 9780199931415| last = Wright| first = Alex| title = Cataloging the World: Paul Otlet and the Birth of the Information Age| location = Oxford ; New York| date = 2014-07-10| pages = 8–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Otlet regarded the project as the centrepiece of a new 'world city'—a centrepiece which eventually became an [[archive]] with more than 12 million [[index card]]s and documents. Some consider it a forerunner of the [[Internet]] (or, perhaps more appropriately, of systematic knowledge projects such as [[Wikipedia]] and [[WolframAlpha]]) and Otlet himself had dreams that one day, somehow, all the information he collected could be accessed by people from the comfort of their own homes.

An English pamphlet published in 1914 described it:

{{quote |The International Centre organises collections of world-wide importance. These collections are the International Museum, the International Library, the International Bibliographic Catalogue and the Universal Documentary Archives.  These collections are conceived as parts of one universal body of documentation, as an encyclopedic survey of human knowledge, as an enormous intellectual warehouse of books, documents, catalogues and scientific objects.  Established according to standardised methods, they are formed by assembling cooperative everything that the participating associations may gather or classify. Closely consolidated and coordinated in all of their parts and enriched by duplicates of all private works wherever undertaken, these collections will tend progressively to constitute a permanent and complete representation of the entire world (Union of International Associations, 1914, p. 116).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = W Boyd | last = Rayward | url = http://people.lis.uiuc.edu/~wrayward/otlet/xanadu.htm | contribution = Visions of Xanadu: Paul Otlet (1868–1944) and Hypertext | title = Jasis | volume = 45 | year = 1994 | pages = 235–50}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Mundaneum was originally housed at the [[Cinquantenaire Museum|Palais du Cinquantenaire]] in [[Brussels]] (Belgium). This was originally renamed Palais Mondial, before the name Mundaneum was adopted. Otlet commissioned architect [[Le Corbusier]] to design a Mundaneum project to be built in [[Geneva, Switzerland]] in 1929.  Although never built, the project triggered the [[Mundaneum Affair]], a theoretical argument between Corbusier and Czech critic and architect [[Karel Teige]].

In 1933, with Otlet's agreement, [[Otto Neurath]] founded the Mundaneum Institute as a branch in [[The Hague]] in 1933,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hegselmann|first=Rainer|article=Introduction|title=Unified Science|date=1987|publisher=D. Reidel Publishing Company|location=Dordrecht}}&lt;/ref&gt; which became central to his activities when he moved to the [[Netherlands]] as a refugee following the defeat of the [[Austrian Social Democratic Party]] in the [[Austrian Civil War]]. In 1936 the Mundaneum Institute launched the [[International Encyclopedia of Unified Science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Neurath|first=Otto|article=An International Encyclopedia of Unified Science (1936)|editor1-last=Cohen|editor1-first=Robert S.|editor2-last=Neurath|editor2-first=Marie|title=Otto Neurath: Philosophical papers 1913-1946|date=1983|publisher=D. Reidel Publishing Company|location=Dordrecht|page=139|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Nazi Germany]] invaded Belgium in 1940, the Mundaneum was replaced with an exhibit of [[Art of the Third Reich|Third Reich art]], and some material was lost.&lt;ref name="Google"/&gt;

The Mundaneum was reconstituted in a large but decrepit building in [[Leopold Park]].
It remained there until it was forced to move again in 1972.

The Mundaneum has since been relocated to a converted 1930s department store in [[Mons]] ([[Wallonia]]), where the existing museum opened in 1998.&lt;ref name="Google"/&gt;

{{Nazism sidebar}}
A '''Nazi punk''' is a [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] who is part of the [[punk subculture]]. The term also describes the related music genre,&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, Amy. ''The Official Punk Rock Book of Lists.'' Backbeat Books, 2007. p. 186&lt;/ref&gt; which is sometimes also referred to as '''hatecore'''. Nazi Punk music generally sounds like other forms of [[punk rock]], but differs by having lyrics that express hatred of some [[Minority groups|ethnic minorities]], [[Jews]], [[homosexuality |homosexuals]],[[anarchism| anarchists]], and other perceived enemies. 

It is a subgenre of punk that contrasts sharply with the [[anti-authoritarianism|anti-authoritarian]] ideas prevalent in much of the punk subculture. While early punks including [[Sid Vicious]] and [[Siouxsie Sioux]] incorporated Nazi imagery such as [[Swastika|Swastikas]], this has commonly been interpreted as an attempt to shock, rather than as a genuine belief in principles of Nazism.  In the long-standing band [[The Exploited]], [[Wattie Buchan]] has been regularly questioned about his swastika tattoo and he has constantly denied being a racist.&lt;ref name=Documentary&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJj6x0neC7E Documentary on the history of the band The Exploited&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978 in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], the [[White nationalism|white nationalist]] [[National Front (United Kingdom)|National Front]] had a punk-oriented youth organization called the Punk Front.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Simon. ''Rip It Up and Start Again: Postpunk 1978-1984.'' Penguin (Non-Classics), 2006. p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Punk Front only lasted one year, it recruited several [[English people|English]] punks, as well as forming a number of [[White supremacy|white power]] punk bands such as The Dentists, The Ventz, Tragic Minds and White Boss.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Simon, ''Rip It Up and Start Again: Postpunk 1978-1984'' (Penguin (Non-Classics), 2006), p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sabin, Roger, ''Punk Rock: So What?: The Cultural Legacy of Punk.'' (Routledge, 1999), pp. 207-208.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1980s, the [[white power skinhead]] band Brutal Attack temporarily transformed into a Nazi punk band.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.detour-records.co.uk/STRAPS.htm "The Straps: History"]&lt;/ref&gt; They said they did that in the hopes of getting public concerts booked easier, but this tactic did not work, and they soon returned to being a racist skinhead band.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

The Nazi Punk subculture appeared in the [[United States]] by the early 1980s in the [[hardcore punk]] scene.&lt;ref&gt;Andersen, Mark. ''Dance of Days: Two Decades of Punk in the Nation's Capital.'' Akashic Books, 2003. p. 159&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Flynn, Michael. ''Globalizing the Streets.'' Columbia University Press, 2008. p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31519">A '''nuclear-free zone''' is an area in which [[nuclear weapons]] (see [[nuclear-weapon-free zone]]) and [[nuclear power]] [[power station|plants]] are banned. The specific ramifications of these depend on the locale in question.

Nuclear-free zones usually neither address nor prohibit [[radiopharmaceuticals]] used in [[nuclear medicine]] even though many of them are produced in nuclear reactors. They typically do not prohibit other nuclear technologies such as [[cyclotrons]] used in particle physics.

Several sub-national authorities worldwide have declared themselves "nuclear-free". However, the label is often symbolic, as nuclear policy is usually determined and regulated at higher levels of government: nuclear weapons and components may traverse nuclear-free zones via military transport without the knowledge or consent of local authorities which had declared nuclear-free zones.

[[Palau]] became the first nuclear-free nation in 1980.&lt;ref name="Palau"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clark|first1=Roger|last2=Roff|first2=Sue Rabbitt|title=Micronesia: the problem of Palau|date=1984|publisher=Minority Rights Group|location=London|isbn=9780946690145|page=13|edition=Rev.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[New Zealand]] was the first Western-allied nation to legislate towards a [[New Zealand's nuclear-free zone|national nuclear free zone]] by effectively renouncing the [[nuclear deterrent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lange|first=David|title=Nuclear Free: The New Zealand Way|year=1990|publisher=Penguin Books|location=New Zealand}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nuclear-free zone by geographical areas==

===Australia===
{{Expand section|1=nuclear power|date=July 2017}}

Many Australian [[Local government in Australia|local government areas]] of Australia have passed anti-nuclear weaponry legislation; notable among these are [[Brisbane]], capital of Queensland, which has been nuclear weapon free since 1983, and the South and North Sydney councils. However the passage of such legislation is generally considered just a symbolic measure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nuclear-free city? Afraid no|url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/news/queensland/nuclearfree-city-afraid-not/2009/03/18/1237054855860.html|accessdate=6 Feb 2014|newspaper=Brisbane Times|date=March 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of councils which have passed anti-nuclear weaponry legislation are members of the Australian Nuclear Free Zones and Toxic Industries Secretariat which has 44 member councils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www2.hornsby.nsw.gov.au/ebp/ebp2001.nsf/21097a8176941d6e4a2564600016add3/b21f168f52a1fe494a2569d500238d0e/$FILE/flyer_algnfz.pdf | publisher=Australian Nuclear Free Zones and Toxic Industries Secretariat | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222201519/http://www2.hornsby.nsw.gov.au/ebp/ebp2001.nsf/21097a8176941d6e4a2564600016add3/b21f168f52a1fe494a2569d500238d0e/$FILE/flyer_algnfz.pdf | archivedate=22 February 2014 | title=[Untitled leaflet]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Austria===
Austria is a nuclear free zone, when a nuclear power station was built during the 1970s at [[Zwentendorf]], [[Austria]], start-up was prevented by a popular vote in 1978. The completed power plant is now marketed as a shooting location for film and television.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nuclear-power-plant.net/index.php?lang=en&amp;item=location Zwentendorf – location&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; On July 9, 1997, the [[Parliament of Austria|Austrian Parliament]] voted unanimously to maintain the country's anti-nuclear policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www10.antenna.nl/wise/index.html?http://www10.antenna.nl/wise/478/aai.html |publisher=WISE News Communique |date=September 26, 1997 |title=Coalition of Nuclear-Free Countries |accessdate=2006-05-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060223141723/http://www10.antenna.nl/wise/index.html?http%3A%2F%2Fwww10.antenna.nl%2Fwise%2F478%2Faai.html |archivedate=February 23, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ironically, the headquarters of the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] is located in Vienna, and the IAEA maintains nuclear laboratories both in Vienna and Seibersdorf.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iaea.org/OurWork/ST/NA/NAAL/labmain.php] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110910162745/http://www.iaea.org/OurWork/ST/NA/NAAL/labmain.php |date=September 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The IAEA has also established programs to assist nuclear energy projects in developing countries.

Austria's anti-nuclear stance also causes tension with its nuclear neighbors. Vienna is located close to the Czech reactor at [[Temelin]], and four reactors are being built in neighboring Slovakia and two in neighboring Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-16359991 | work=BBC News | title=Austria and Czech Republic divided over nuclear power | date=January 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Austria also draws from regional electricity grids, meaning it imports nuclear power, although chancellor Werner Faymann has pledged to eliminate Austria's reliance on foreign power by 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fr.myeurop.info/2011/07/11/nucleaire-l-autriche-se-debranche-des-2015-2936 Nucléaire: l'Autriche se débranche dès 2015&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
[[Vancouver]] is a nuclear weapons free city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zoning &amp; Development Bylaw 3575, Section 10|url=http://bylaws.vancouver.ca/zoning/sec10.pdf|publisher=City of Vancouver|page=10.23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Victoria, British Columbia]] is also a nuclear weapons free city. This has caused problems as nearby Esquimalt houses [[CFB Esquimalt]], Canada's Pacific naval base, which is used frequently by the [[United States Navy]]. The USN routinely sends ships or aircraft carriers loaded with nuclear weapons to Esquimalt. As a result, the ships are forced to dock out of the city limits as not to violate the city by-laws.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}The policy does not limit operations at [[TRIUMF]], Canada's national laboratory for nuclear and particle physics at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver. The province of [[British Columbia]] also bans mining for uranium, and the construction of nuclear power plants within its territorial limits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energybc.ca/profiles/nuclear.html EnergyBC: Nuclear Power&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307170021/http://www.energybc.ca/profiles/nuclear.html |date=2014-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nanaimo, British Columbia]], [[Kitimat, British Columbia]]; [[Red Deer, Alberta]], and [[Regina, Saskatchewan]] are also  nuclear weapons-free cities.

===Former Soviet Union===

====Central Asia====
{{Expand section|1=nuclear power|date=July 2017}}

All states of [[Central Asia]] have signed the [[Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons]] and signed the [[Central Asian Nuclear Weapon Free Zone]] treaty. Thus, there are no technologies to create a weapon or enrich the particles, but in [[Tajikistan]], during the Soviet Union, such initiatives were brought to life, but with the collapse of the Soviet Union, the facilities were dismantled and moved to the [[Russian Federation]]. The Treaty came into force on 21 March 2009.

====Estonia====
{{refimprove|date=December 2013}}
After Estonia [[Singing Revolution#Estonia|seceded from the Soviet Union]] in the early 1990s, Estonia became a nuclear-free country.  
The two land-based [[nuclear reactor]]s at the [[Soviet Navy]] [[Nuclear navy|nuclear submarine]] training centre in [[Paldiski]] were removed when Russia finally relinquished control of the nuclear reactor facilities in September 1995.
There are no nuclear power stations in Estonia.

===Japan===
[[File:Kobe City view from Po-ai Shiosai Park01s3.jpg|thumb|350px|Nuclear-free [[Kobe Port]], seen from Po-ai Shiosai Park in 2011]]

{{main article|Japan's non-nuclear policy}}

As a resource-poor nation, Japan is heavily reliant on nuclear power, but its unique experience in [[World War II]] has led to the wholesale rejection of nuclear weapons, holding nuclear weapons shall not be manufactured in, possessed by, or allowed entry into Japan. These tenets, known as the [[Three Non-Nuclear Principles]], were first stated by [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]] [[Eisaku Satō]] in 1967, and were adopted as a parliamentary resolution in 1971, though they have never formally been entered into law. They continue to reflect the attitudes of both government and the general public, who remain staunchly opposed to the manufacture or use of nuclear weapons.

The [[Japan Self-Defense Forces]] have never made any attempt to manufacture or otherwise obtain nuclear arms, and no nuclear weapons are known to have been introduced into the Japanese [[Japanese archipelago|Home Islands]] since the end of [[World War II]]. While the United States does not maintain nuclear bases within its military installations on the Home Islands, it is believed to have once stored weapons at [[Okinawa]], which remained under US administrative jurisdiction until 1972.

===Italy===
{{main article|Italian nuclear power referendum, 1987}}
Italy is a nuclear free zone since the Italian nuclear power referendum of November 1987. Following center-right parties' victory in the 2008 election, Italy's industry minister announced that the government scheduled the construction to start the first new Italian nuclear-powered plant by 2013. The announced project was paused in March 2011, after the Japanese earthquake, and scrapped after a referendum on 12–13 June 2011.

===New Zealand===
{{main article|New Zealand's nuclear-free zone}}

In 1984, Prime Minister [[David Lange]] barred [[nuclear power|nuclear-powered]] or [[nuclear weapon|nuclear-armed]] ships from using [[New Zealand]] ports or entering New Zealand waters.  Under the [[New Zealand Nuclear Free Zone, Disarmament, and Arms Control Act 1987]],&lt;ref&gt;[[New Zealand Nuclear Free Zone, Disarmament, and Arms Control Act 1987]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nuclear Free Zone"&gt;[http://canterbury.cyberplace.org.nz/peace/nukefree.html Nuclear Free Zone&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; territorial sea and land of New Zealand became nuclear weapons and nuclear-powered ship free zones. It does not ban nuclear power stations. A research reactor was operated by the University of Canterbury until 1981. Official planning for a nuclear power station continued until the 1980s. A nuclear reactor provided electricity for McMurdo Station, in the New Zealand Antarctic Territory from 1962–1972.

The Act prohibits "entry into the internal waters of New Zealand 12 miles (22.2 km) radius by any ship whose propulsion is wholly or partly dependent on nuclear power" and bans the dumping of [[radioactive waste]] within the nuclear-free zone, as well as prohibiting any New Zealand citizen or resident "to manufacture, acquire, possess, or have any control over any nuclear explosive device."&lt;ref name="Nuclear Free Zone"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greens.org.nz/searchdocs/speech5334.html New Zealand Nuclear Free Zone Extension Bill – Green Party&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060630032138/http://greens.org.nz/searchdocs/speech5334.html |date=2006-06-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Combined with the firm policy of the United States to "neither confirm nor deny" whether particular naval vessels carry nuclear weapons, the Act effectively bars these ships from entering New Zealand waters.&lt;ref name="Pugh"&gt;{{cite book

New Zealand's security treaty with the United States, [[ANZUS]], did not mention nuclear deterrence and did not require unconditional port access. However, after New Zealand refused entry to [[USS Buchanan (DDG-14)|USS ''Buchanan'']], the [[United States]] government suspended its [[ANZUS]] obligations to New Zealand, seeing New Zealand's effective rejection of United States Navy vessels as voiding the treaty. The [[Fourth Labour Government of New Zealand|Lange Labour government]] did not see their stance as incompatible with the treaty and sought a compromise for over two years before passing the Act.&lt;ref name="Pugh"/&gt; Support for the non-nuclear policy was bolstered by the perceived over-reaction of the United States and by the [[sinking of the Rainbow Warrior]] by [[DGSE|French spies]] while docked in [[Auckland]]. According to some commentators, the legislation was a milestone in New Zealand's development as a nation and seen as an important act of sovereignty, self-determination and cultural identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4150550.stm | work=BBC News | title=Lange's impact on NZ and world | date=August 14, 2005 | accessdate=May 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110518224427/http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/06/08/asia/AS-GEN-New-Zealand-Nuclear-Landmark.php Nuclear threat continues to grow, New Zealand warns on anniversary of anti-nuclear law – International Herald Tribune&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[New Zealand]]’s three decade [[anti-nuclear]] campaign is the only successful movement of its type in the world which resulted in the nation's nuclear-free zone status being enshrined in legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The nuclear-free zone law does not make building land-based nuclear power plants illegal. However, the relatively small [[Electricity sector in New Zealand|electricity system]], abundance of other resources to generate electricity, and public opposition has meant a nuclear power plant has never gone beyond the investigation phase – a nuclear power plant was proposed north of [[Auckland]] in the early 1970s, but the discovery of large natural gas reserves in [[Taranaki region|Taranaki]] saw the proposal shelved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf97.html|title=Nuclear Energy Prospects in New Zealand|publisher=World Nuclear Association|date=April 2009|accessdate=2009-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nordic countries===
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2013}}
Nuclear weapons-free Nordic (''Finn. Ydinaseeton Pohjola'') was an initiative by the [[President of Finland]] [[Urho Kekkonen]] for a nuclear weapons-free zone in the [[Nordic countries]]. The aim was to prevent the Nordic countries from becoming a nuclear battleground and a route for [[cruise missile]]s in the event of a nuclear war between the [[Soviet Union]] and [[NATO]].

Nuclear energy, however, is used in both [[Finland]] and [[Sweden]].

===Palau===
[[Palau]] adopted its first constitution in July 1979, stating that the Micronesian country would be "nuclear-free". The United States told the Palauan government that this constitution was likely incompatible with the [[Compact of Free Association]]. The Palauan government submitted a revised version of the constitution  without the "nuclear-free" clause the following October. The Palauan people rejected the revised document and instated the original constitution in July 1980.&lt;ref name="Palau"/&gt; Seven years later, however, the Palauan people voted to overturn their nuclear-free status out of "economic survival".&lt;ref name="NY Times Palau"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/07/world/palau-drops-nuclear-free-status.html |title=Palau Drops Nuclear-Free Status |date=7 August 1987 |publisher=AP |work=The New York Times |accessdate=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===

The Nuclear Free Zone Movement in the [[United Kingdom]] was very strong in early 1980s; up to two hundred local authorities including [[county council]]s, [[Districts of England|district council]]s and [[city council]]s such as the [[Greater London Council]] (GLC) (before its abolition) declared themselves to be 'nuclear free'. The first 'nuclear-free zone' in the UK was [[Manchester City Council]] in 1980 – this still exists to this day.  Wales became 'nuclear free' on 23 February 1982 after Clwyd County Council declared itself 'nuclear free' and the Nuclear Free Wales Declaration was made.  This policy was legally underpinned by Section 137 of the Local Government Act, which allowed local authorities to spend a small amount on whatever members considered was in the interest of their area or a part of their area.

UK nuclear-free local authorities refused to take part in civil defence exercises relating to nuclear war, which they thought were futile. The non-cooperation of the nuclear-free zone authorities was the main reason for the cancellation of the national 'Hard Rock' [[civil defence]] exercise in July 1982.  In England and Wales 24 of the 54 county councils refused to participate and seven more co-operated only in a half-hearted way.&lt;ref&gt;Bolsover, Philip, "A victory – and a new development", in Minnion, J., and Bolsover, P., ''The CND Story'', London: Alison and Busby, 1983&lt;/ref&gt; This has been seen as a victory for the [[Peace movement#United Kingdom|British Peace movement]] against the policies of [[Margaret Thatcher]]. Generally, nuclear-free zones were predominantly [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] controlled councils but [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] and even a few [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] councillors were often active in this respect too.

A number of towns, cities and counties in the [[United States]] established themselves as Nuclear-Free Zones in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. The first was [[Missoula, Montana]]. In the November 1978 general election, Missoula voters overwhelmingly approved a ballot initiative in the form of a land-use ordinance establishing the entirety of Missoula County as a "'nuclear free' zoning district" banning all nuclear facilities except those for medical purposes. (In the same election, Montana voters approved a statewide initiative by a 2–1 margin barring nuclear facilities or reactors without strict state-enforced regulatory standards and ratification by popular referendum, and in a follow-up 1980 initiative, Montanans narrowly voted to ban the disposal of nuclear waste.) That Missoula's measure was originally drafted as a zoning ordinance legally enforceable by the county planning department apparently created the popular term "Nuclear Free Zone" adopted as the name of the local political action group sponsoring the initiative and later used by other jurisdictions worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;For more on the Missoula zoning ordinance, see Missoula Independent, Nov. 30, 2000, at: http://missoulanews.bigskypress.com/missoula/reading-the-sign/Content?oid=1133059.

Subsequently, the tiny town of [[Garrett Park, Maryland]], attracted worldwide attention with its referendum in May, 1982. The following year, [[Takoma Park, Maryland]], was officially declared a nuclear-free zone in 1983 by then-mayor Sam Abbott. A citizen committee of the local city council continues to monitor city contracts. The city cannot hold contracts with any company associated with any aspect of nuclear weapons without a waiver from the citizen committee. In September 2005, Takoma Park took a stand against the transportation of high-level nuclear waste through the City. It voted to amend its Nuclear-Free Zone Ordinance to give its citizen committee responsibility to collect information and from this information and from consultations with individuals and organizations involved in the transportation of high-level nuclear waste, to advise the City on how to promote the safety and welfare of its citizens from harmful exposure to high-level nuclear waste.&lt;ref&gt;For more on Takoma Park's nuclear-free history see: {{cite web |url=http://www.takomaparkmd.gov/committees/nfz/nftpc.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-11-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060628032216/http://www.takomaparkmd.gov/committees/nfz/nftpc.htm |archivedate=2006-06-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another well-known nuclear-free community is [[Berkeley, California]], whose citizens passed the Nuclear Free Berkeley Act in 1986 which allows the city to levy fines for nuclear weapons-related activity and to boycott companies involved in the United States nuclear infrastructure. The City of Berkeley has posted signs at city limits proclaiming its nuclear free status. The ordinance specifies possible fines for such activities within its borders. The [[University of California, Berkeley]] is deeply involved in the [[history of nuclear weapons]], and the [[University of California]] system until recently managed operations at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]], a U.S. nuclear weapons design laboratory, and continues to manage the [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]]. At the time of the passage of the act, the University operated a nuclear reactor for research purposes, the [[Etcheverry Hall|Etcheverry Reactor]], which it continued to operate after the act went into effect. The University of California, as a state institution, is not subject to Berkeley's municipal regulations, including the ban. Berkeley also has major freeway and train lines which are used in transporting nuclear materials.

On November 14, 1984 the [[Davis, California]] [[City Council]] declared the city to be a nuclear-free zone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://daviswiki.org/Nuclear_Free_Zone Nuclear Free Zone – Davis Wiki&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Davis has major freeway and train arteries running through it which are used for transporting nuclear materials.  The [[University of California]], with a campus at [[University of California, Davis|Davis]], runs a research reactor at the nearby former [[McClellan Air Force Base]], as well as workers who are involved with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.

On November 8, 1988 the city of [[Oakland, California]] passed "Measure T" with 57% of the vote, making that city a nuclear free zone.  Under Ordinance No. 11062 CMS then passed on December 6, 1988, the city is restricted from doing business with ''"any entity knowingly engaged in nuclear weapons work and any of its agents, subsidiaries or affiliates which are engaged in nuclear weapons work."''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oaklandnet.com/government/obra/raillineremoval/Schedule%20P%20-%20Nuclear%20Free.pdf Schedule P, City of Oakland, rev. 7/30/01] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526022607/http://www.oaklandnet.com/government/obra/raillineremoval/Schedule%20P%20-%20Nuclear%20Free.pdf |date=May 26, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The measure was invalidated in federal court, on the grounds that it interfered with the Federal Government's constitutional authority over national defense and atomic energy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/28/us/a-nuclear-free-zone-is-ruled-to-be-invalid.html A Nuclear-Free Zone Is Ruled to Be Invalid, New York Times/AP, 4/28/90]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www10.antenna.nl/wise/334/3337.html Guardian (US), 23 May 1990, p7, via WISE Nuclear Issues Information Service] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090611125759/http://www10.antenna.nl/wise/334/3337.html |date=June 11, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The issue being Oakland is a major port, and like Berkeley, and Davis, has major freeway and train arteries running through it.  In 1992, the Oakland City Council unanimously reinstated modified elements of the older ordinance, reportedly bringing the total number of Nuclear Free Zones in the United States at that time to 188, with a total population of over 17 million in 27 states.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-18768942.html Oakland City Council Reinstates Nuclear-Free Policy, US Newswire 7/3/92, via Highbeam]{{dead link|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Operating deflection shape''' (ODS), is a term often used in the structural [[Vibration#Vibration analysis|vibration analysis]], known as ODS analysis. ODS analysis is a method used for visualisation of the vibration pattern of a machine or structure as influenced by its own operating forces. This is as opposed to the study of the vibration pattern of a machine under an (known) external force analysis, which is called [[modal analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/research/hsl_pdf/2006/hsl06104.pdf | title=The use of Operating Deflection Shapes (ODS) to model the vibration of sanders and polishers | accessdate=May 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Orientation''' is a function of the [[mind]] involving awareness of three dimensions: [[time]], [[Location (geography)|place]] and [[person]].&lt;ref&gt;Berrios G E (1982) Disorientation States in Psychiatry. ''Comprehensive Psychiatry'' 23: 479-491&lt;/ref&gt; Problems with orientation lead to ''dis''orientation, and can be due to various conditions, from [[delirium]] to [[Substance intoxication|intoxication]]. Typically, disorientation is first in time, then in place and finally in person.

==Assessment==
{{manual|section|date=September 2017}}
In the context of an accident or major trauma, the [[emergency medical technician#Emergency Medical Responder|Emergency Medical Responder]] performs spiraling (increasingly detailed) assessments which guide the critical first response. Assessment of mental orientation typically lands within the immediate top three priorities: 
# '''Safety''' - Assess the area safety (potential traffic, fire, overhead/underfoot objects and collapse risks, rushing water, gunfire, chemical/radiation threats, storm conditions, downed power lines, etc.), wait for the threat to subside, or move the person to safety if and when possible, all without endangering oneself. 
# '''ABCs''' - Note conscious or unconscious then assess '''A'''irway, '''B'''reathing and '''C'''irculation factors (with priority to any potential gross or debilitating blood loss.)
# '''Orientation''' - Determine if the person is ''"awake, alert, and oriented, times three (to person, place, and time)."'' This is frequently abbreviated '''AAOx3''' which also serves as a mnemonic. The assessment involves asking the patient to repeat his own full name, his present location, and today's date. The assessment is best done right up front, ahead of moving or transporting the victim, because it may illuminate potential internal damage.
#'''Event/Situation'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pgu.edu/downloads/mental-status-exam.pdf|title=LICENSED PROFESSIONALS PRACTICE DESCRIPTION - MENTAL STATUS EXAM|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/52389268|title=Handbook of psychological assessment|last=Gary.|first=Groth-Marnat,|date=2003|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=0471420182|edition= 4th|location=Hoboken, N.J.|oclc=52389268}}&lt;/ref&gt; - A fourth category is now used as well. If the person is oriented to what is going on around them, then they are said to be '''AAOx4'''. AAOx3 is not a concerning response since people are sometimes less aware of the situation due to pain, time of day, or lack of significant event.

Alternately, the letters in AAOx4 can be documented as '''COAX4'''. A person who is COAx4 is said to be "conscious, alert, &amp; oriented to person, place, time and event". When a handoff report is made, anything less than 4 is specifically noted for clarity (e.g., patient is COAx2, oriented to place and self).

Mental orientation is closely related, and often intermixed with trauma shock, including physical shock (see: [[Shock (circulatory)]]) and mental shock (see: [[Acute stress reaction]], a psychological condition in response to terrifying events.)

The exact [[brain|cerebral]] region involved in orientation is uncertain, but lesions of the [[brain stem]] and the [[cerebral hemisphere]]s have been reported to cause disorientation, suggesting that they act together in maintaining awareness and its subfunction of orientation.

==Disorientation==
{{expand section|date=September 2017}}
Disorientation is the opposite of orientation.  It is a cognitive disability in which the senses of time, direction, and [[Recognition (sociology)|recognition]] of items (things), people and places become difficult to distinguish/identify.&lt;ref&gt;Isaac M., Janca A., Sartious N., 1994.''ICD-10 Symptom Glossery For Mental Disorders,''10th ed. WHO.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes of mental disorientation==
Disorientation can occur in healthy young adults as well as in the elderly or ill person. While exercising, if a person becomes dehydrated as a result of over-exertion, he or she may become disoriented to the time or place. While exercising, the body may not be able to supply enough oxygen to the brain fast enough.  Mental disorientation can be the aim of some performance art, as creators with 'audience disorientation' as a goal may work to deliberately augment sensations of time, place, person, purpose.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10565">A '''peace walk''' or '''peace march''', sometimes referred to as a '''peace pilgrimage''',  is a form of [[nonviolent]] action where a person or groups of people march a set distance to raise awareness of particular issues important to the walkers.

==Europe==
Europe is launching its first permanent Peace Walk Route, that will run along the former division between East and West Europe and end in Trieste, N-E Italy. A pan European network is currently working on its Design, and it is set to open in 2014, to mark the 100th anniversary of World War I.

==India==
One famous example was that of [[Vinoba Bhave]], who undertook a peace walk with many of his followers throughout India for land reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Fifties Spiritual Marketplace: American Religion in a Decade of Conflict|first=Robert S. |last=Ellwood|publisher=Rutgers University Press|ISBN=0-8135-2346-X|pages=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent peace walk campaign named ''[[Freedom Walk]]'' was organized by the Free Software Community in [[Kerala]] in 2008. 4 volunteers walked 750 miles (1,200 km) from one end of the state to the other to promote [[Free Software]].&lt;ref name="fw-fsf"&gt;[http://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/freedom-walk Freedom Walk], covered under community events in FSF Blogs.&lt;/ref&gt;

A peace walk was undertaken in 1962 by [[Satish Kumar]] and his companion who walked without money from India via the [[Soviet Union]], France and the [[United Kingdom|UK]] to the United States (using [[ship]]s to cross the channel and Atlantic). Vinoba gave 2 gifts to Satish and his companion: pennilessness, i.e. [[voluntary poverty]], and [[vegetarianism]].

==UK==
Early in 1984, [[peace camp]]ers walked 26 miles from [[Daws hill]] to [[Naphill]] through country roads and countryside to raise money for ''[[The Angry Pacifist]]'' magazine.

==US==
[[File:San Diego Peace March 2003.jpg|thumb|About 7,000 San Diego Peace Marchers in Balboa Park Protest the Iraq War, March 15, 2003]]The ''[[King-Carter Freedom Peace Walk]]'' is a 1.5-mile walkway in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]'s (USA) Freedom Park. It commemorates the only two Georgia winners of the [[Nobel Prize]] for Peace: [[Martin Luther King Jr]]. and [[Jimmy Carter]].

Various peace organizations throughout the United States have organized marches and vigils to protest the [[Iraq War]], since before the war started in 2003, and then annually ever since.  Sometimes these marches are coordinated to take place on the same day across the nation. In San Diego, the greatest number of anti-war protesters, an estimated 7,000, turned out for a demonstration on March 15, just five days before the beginning of the Iraq War.

==International==

===The Interfaith Pilgrimage for Peace and Life===
"The Interfaith Pilgrimage for Peace and Life" started in Auschwitz, Poland on December 8, 1994, and ended in Nagasaki on the fiftieth anniversary of the Nagasaki bombing, 9 August 1995. It was led by [[Nipponzan-Myōhōji]] Japanese Buddhist monks. The monks, however, were dwarfed in number by American, European, South American and Japanese lay people.

The trip was organized to both commemorate the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II as well as to be witness to the suffering in contemporary war zones. The group walked from Auschwitz to Vienna, then travelled through Croatia, Bosnia and Serbia. They crossed the front lines of the Bosnian war in Mostar and held a day of vigil, fasting and prayer there. The next leg took them through Israel, the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, Jordan and Iraq.

The group travelled across the front lines in Cambodia, where they joined the [[Dhammayietra]], an annual Cambodian peace walk led by "the Gandhi of Cambodia" [[Maha Ghosananda]]. They then visited war sites in Vietnam and the Philippines before going to Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

This walk was one of many peace pilgrimages organized by the Nipponzan Myōhōji monks, but it was the largest in scale, number of participants, time, and distance travelled.

Over 1000 people participated in at least part of the pilgrimage, including Buddhists, [[Quaker]]s, [[Catholic]]s, [[Muslim]]s and [[Jew]]s. The pilgrimage received media attention and books were written about it.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

===A Walk to Moscow===
[[File:Donna,_(Spirit),_Bradley_and_her_son_on_A_Walk_for_Survival,_Oregon_Coast,_April_22,_1980.jpeg|thumb|right|Donna Bradley and her son on A Walk For Survival, Oregon Coast, April 22, 1980]]
"A Walk to Moscow" was a peace walk, one of many walks for peace in the 20th century. These were specially organized by groups of [[pacifists]] and [[List_of_peace_activists|peace activists]] who wanted to make some protest against the politics of war and the use of chemical, biological and [[nuclear weapons]]. In the early 1960s, there was a walk across the United States, [[Europe]] and the [[USSR]] (its history is told in a book ''You Come with Naked Hands'' by [[Bradford Lyttle]].

In the 1980s, a group organized to walk across America and through Europe to [[Moscow]] to show solidarity with all people and to demonstrate in a grass roots way that all people are linked by their right to live on the earth in peace and safety. This walk was conceived by organizers while on another peace walk "A Walk for Survival" (from Santa Cruz, California to Washington State) in 1980. While at a requested meeting with the Russian Consulate in San Francisco one organizer, Jack Chalmers asked if we continued our walk across America, and Europe would we be allowed to walk to Moscow? The Consulate answered "of course". "A Walk for Survival" ended at Bangor, [[Washington (state)|Washington]] State at the site of a Trident nuclear submarine base, and the organizers immediately started planning "A Walk to Moscow". The walk started in Bangor on March 1, 1981 and reached the East Coast in time to winter it out in [[Boston]], before flying to Europe in March 1982. The summer of 1982 was spent walking across the UK (with a side-tip to Ireland), France, Belgium, and [[Federal Republic of Germany]] (with a trip to [[West Berlin]] by bus which returned to its starting point in order for the walking route to continue uninterrupted.) The Walk operated by sending advance teams a few weeks ahead to cities and towns along a prospective path to set up press, speaking engagements and accommodations for the group. Decisions were made only by complete consensus, which often led to long and stormy meetings.

The [[German Democratic Republic]] had refused entry to the group, so they walked south to [[Bavaria]] and stayed there for the winter, while negotiating visas for [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Poland]] and the USSR.  A Walk to Moscow (the indefinite article rather than the definite "The Walk" was important to many of the original walkers, as it implied that it was only one initiative, and others would hopefully follow.  The distinction was, however, lost on people in the Eastern countries of the route,as Slavonic languages do not have words for either an or the!) spent nearly a year in Europe working from an Old Mill in [[Regnitzlosau]] in [[Bavaria]], Germany. It was difficult to get the governments then in the [[Communist]] Bloc to allow the group to walk through their territory. While the group negotiated with the government of Czechoslovakia, Poland and Russia the walkers visited many places on foot in Germany and gave talks to local Peace groups. Some members of the group got involved in [[passive resistance]] chaining themselves to railings over conscription in Germany or others fasted for peace in the world. Members went to Denmark to join in with peace groups and talk about the walk.

In 1983 visas were obtained for Czechoslovakia and Poland, and a continuous walking route was planned and successfully carried out as far as the border between Poland and the USSR.

Relations with official "peace" groups in those countries were tricky, and the Czech government tried to incorporate the initiative into their showpiece pro-[[Warsaw Pact]] 1983 conference in [[Prague]] - however the group did not partake, although a few members lobbied delegates outside, and were invited in for one discussion).  Walking across the USSR was not permitted however.  The group entered and transited to [[Minsk]], then [[Smolensk]], hoping for some compromise in negotiations, but this did not happen.  At this point many of the members chose to return, and not go to Moscow; the others tried to walk to Moscow anyway, but were immediately apprehended and sent to rejoin the others in Minsk.  Some members went to Denmark to join in with peace groups and talk about the walk. When the walk finished some people from the group talked at a [[CND]] rally about their work and the passive resistance movement. The group membership was international, people came from all over the world to join in and make a difference.

Some Walk to Moscow participants later met with other walks that crossed the U.S. and Europe, including [[Walk of the People - A Pilgrimage for Life]], which occurred from 1984 to 1985.

===Women Cross DMZ===
The [[Women Cross DMZ]] ([[Korean Demilitarized Zone|Korean demilitarized zone]]) group, which includes noted American feminist and activist [[Gloria Steinem]], [[Nobel Peace]] Prize laureate Mairead Maguire, and organizer [[Christine Ahn]] with other activist women members, have conducted a peace symposium in [[Pyongyang]] on May 20, 2015 and this women group walked across the DMZ, separating North and South Korea for peace on May 24, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://time.com/3890280/gloria-steinem-north-korea-south-womencrossdmz/ | work=Time | first=Sabrina | last=Toppa | title=Gloria Steinem in North Korea for DMZ Peace March | date=May 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.buzzfeed.com/rosiegray/women-activists-defend-north-korea-trip-on-capitol-hill#.sx3Ll3DK&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Mosaicr seagull.jpg|thumb|200px|A photographic mosaic of a [[sea gull]] made from pictures of [[bird]]s and other [[nature]] photos using [[hexagon]]al tiles]]

In the field of photographic  imaging, a '''photographic mosaic''', also known under the term '''Photomosaic''', a [[portmanteau]] of photo and [[mosaic]], is a picture (usually a [[photograph]]) that has been divided into (usually equal sized) tiled sections, each of which is replaced with another photograph that matches the target photo.&lt;ref name="Cartwright07"&gt;Cartwright (2007) p.102 quote: Photographic mosaic, also known as Photomosaic, a portmanteau of photo and mosaic, is a picture that is divided into small sections. When viewed as a whole, it appears to be one image, when in fact the image is made up of hundreds or even thousands of smaller images.&lt;/ref&gt; When viewed at low magnifications, the individual [[pixel]]s appear as the primary image, while close examination reveals that the image is in fact made up of many hundreds or thousands of smaller images.&lt;ref name="Cartwright07"/&gt; Most of the time they are a computer-created type of [[Photomontage|montage]].

There are two kinds of mosaic, depending on how the matching is done.  In the simpler kind, each part of the target image is averaged down to a single color.  Each of the library images is also reduced to a single color.  Each part of the target image is then replaced with one from the library where these colors are as similar as possible.  In effect, the target image is reduced in resolution (by [[downsampling]]), and then each of the resulting pixels is replaced with an image whose average color matches that pixel.

In the more advanced kind of photographic mosaic, the target image is not downsampled, and the matching is done by comparing each pixel in the rectangle to the corresponding pixel from each library image.  The rectangle in the target is then replaced with the library image that minimizes the total difference.  This requires much more computation than the simple kind, but the results can be much better since the pixel-by-pixel matching can preserve the resolution of the target image.

Originally, the term ''photomosaic'' referred to compound photographs created by stitching together a series of adjacent pictures of a scene. Space scientists have been assembling mosaics of this kind since at least as early as the Soviet Union space satellite missions to the moon in the late 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = To a Rocky Moon: A Geologist's History of Lunar Exploration|last = Wilhelms|first = Don E.|publisher = University of Arizona Press|year = 1993|isbn = |location = |pages = ii (Front Matter)|url = http://www.lpi.usra.edu/publications/books/rockyMoon/01FrontMatter.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name photomosaic and an implementation concept were trademarked by Robert Silvers' Runaway Technology, Inc.&lt;ref name="USTradmarkOffice"/&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Photo-mosaic-Joseph-Francis.jpg|thumb|right|1993 ''Live from Bell Labs'' event poster]]
* '''1993''' Joseph Francis, working for R/Greenberg Associates in Manhattan, is believed to be the inventor of the modern-day computer-generated colour image versions. His ''Live from Bell Labs'' poster created in 1993 used computer-themed tile photographs to create a mosaic of a face ([[Ryszard Horowitz]]/ Photography and Art Direction, Robert Bowen/ Digital Artist). He went on to create a mosaic for ''Animation Magazine'' in 1993, which was repeated in ''Wired Magazine'' (November 1994, p.&amp;nbsp;106).  Francis has said on his "History of Photo Mosaics" webpage that his interest in developing these techniques further was in part stimulated by the work of artist [[Chuck Close]].
* '''1994''' [[Dave McKean]] creates an image for DC Comics, a mosaic of a face made from photos of faces, although this is believed to be created manually using Photoshop.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Jfk mosaic adam finkelstein.jpg|thumb|left|1994 John F. Kennedy mosaic, Adam Finkelstein and Sandy Farrier]] --&gt;
* '''1994''' Adam Finkelstein and Sandy Farrier create a mosaic of [[John F. Kennedy]] from parts of Marilyn Monroe pictures. The result was displayed in the Xerox PARC Algorithmic Art Show in 1994.
* '''1994''' Benetton: AIDS - Faces mosaic. Over one thousand young peoples' portraits from all over the word computer-processed spell out the word AIDS.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Gioconda Sapiens Spain Domus.jpg|thumb|right|1995 Gioconda Sapiens, Domus museum, Spain]] --&gt;
* '''1995''' The '' Gioconda Sapiens'', a face with ten thousand faces, was presented to the public in April 1995 (Spain, Domus museum). This was the first large photographic mosaic, using photographs of 10,062 people from 110 countries to make the ''[[Mona Lisa]]''.
* '''1995''' Adam Finkelstein (published mosaic in Mossy Bits) creates a mosaic of the oil painting ''[[American Gothic]]'' from images collected from the Web in early 1995.
* '''1995''' Robert Silvers creates an algorithm for generating Photomosaics programmatically and goes on to trademark the term Photomosaic and patent his process for creation of Photomosaics in 1997.

==Artistic aspects==
There is debate over whether Photomosaics are an art or mere technique.&lt;ref&gt;Silvers (2000) quote: "More than anything else people ask me whether Photomosaics are an art or a science. l tell them that Photomosaics, like any art in formative stage, has elements of both."&lt;/ref&gt; The making of a photomosaic is sometimes parallelled and compared to forms of [[artistic appropriation]], like [[literary assemblage]].&lt;ref name="Menke08p232"&gt;Menke (2008) p.232 quote: [In Rudyard Kipling's 1902 science-fiction short story "Wireless"] we recognize that the tale's marshalling of realistic particulars has also been a systematic importation of details from Keats's poetry and life history [...] The tale's elaborate descriptions were really Keats's pre-scriptions all along. As in a photomosaic image, the elements of the story that make it seem recognizable and real turn out to be chosen from an artificially constrained palette of appropriations; examined closely, each realistic detail reveals itself as a micro-quotation from that collection.&lt;/ref&gt;

Artists such as [[David Hockney]], Christopher Kates and Pep Ventosa have pioneered their own photographic mosaic techniques where multiple photographs are taken of a scene and then pieced together again to create a cohesive image.

==Trademark and intellectual property of the concept==
Robert Silvers, a Master's student at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], filed for a [[trademark]] on the term ''Photomosaic'' on September 3, 1996. This trademark was registered on August 12, 2003.&lt;ref name="USTradmarkOffice"&gt;{{cite web
  | title = Trademark information for Trademark 75159436
  | publisher = US Trademark Office
  | url = http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&amp;entry=75159436
  | accessdate = 2007-08-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Silvers also applied for a U.S. [[patent]] on the production of Photomosaics on January 2, 1997, which was granted as {{Cite patent|US|6137498}} in October 2000 and has been assigned to Runaway Technology, Inc. Patent applications in other countries were also filed, and patents granted include {{Cite patent|EP|0852363}}, {{Cite patent|JP|10269353}}, {{Cite patent|CA|2226059}}, and {{Cite patent|AU|723815B}}. He is quoted as saying: "By being granted this patent in the United States and other countries, we can protect our proprietary innovations and continue to make unique artwork." &lt;ref name="PhotomosaicCompay"&gt;{{cite web
 |url= http://www.photomosaic.com/corporate_patents.html
 |title= Robert Silvers {{!}} Corporate {{!}} Patents
 |first= Robert |last= Silvers
 |publisher= Runaway Technology, Inc.
 |accessdate= November 12, 2011
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2008, the [[Public Patent Foundation]] filed a formal request with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to review certain claims in the {{Cite patent|US|6137498}} on photomosaics. The request was granted and a reexamination proceeding ensued. On August 31, 2010, the USPTO issued a Reexamination Certificate confirming the patentability of all claims in the patent which were amended to refer to shape matching (a feature that contributes to the high resolution of photomosaics).

There are a number of other commercial companies that create mosaics with photos. Since there has been no litigation of these patents, these companies must therefore either use processes that do not infringe on the particular claimed process, have licenses under the patents, or are infringing those patents but Runaway Technology has chosen not to bring infringement proceedings.

Silvers' patent may be regarded as a [[software patent]], a subject over which there is a great deal of [[software patent debate|debate]]. For example, {{EPC Article|52|2|c}} states that "programs for computers as such" are not regarded as [[patentable subject matter|patentable inventions]]. Nevertheless, current practice relating to [[Software patents under the European Patent Convention|computer-implemented inventions under the EPC]] means that a process that provides a technical effect may be patented even if it is implemented by a computer.

The UK patent deriving from {{Cite patent|EP|0852363}} became the subject of revocation proceedings in July 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Using the [http://www.patent.gov.uk/patent/p-find/p-find-number.htm UK Patents Status Enquiry] for EP0852363 provides full details on the current status of the patent.&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2009, the [[United Kingdom Patent Office|UK Intellectual Property Office]] (UK-IPO) decided that the patent should not be revoked and terminated the proceeding. The European patents expired on 31 December 2017.

==Video mosaic==
Photographic mosaics are typically formed from a collection of still images. A more recent phenomenon, however, has been video mosaics which assemble video clips rather than still images to create a larger image. The closing credits of the 2005 [[PlayStation 2]] game ''[[God of War (video game)|God of War]]'', for example, incorporates a still image of the main character, [[Kratos (God of War)|Kratos]], formed from a number of in-game videos.

The term "video mosaic" also describes a large still image made from adjacent frames of video, such as those from video shots of geographic features like roads or cities. A mosaic of the video's relevant frames replaces the full video, saving time and bandwidth, since the stills are much smaller.

'''''Pilgrimage to Cedars of Lebanon''''' (in Hungarian: '''''Zarándoklás a cédrusokhoz Libanonban''''') is a picture of the Hungarian painter [[Tivadar Csontváry Kosztka]] of 1907.&lt;ref name="europeana.eu"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2063625/HU_280_006.html |title=Pilgrimage to the Cedars in Lebanon, Tivadar Csontváry Kosztka |website=europeana.eu |language=en |access-date=23 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hung-art.hu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hung-art.hu/frames.html?/magyar/c/csontvar/muvek/5/csont510.html |title=Zarándoklás a cédrusokhoz Libanonban |website=hung-art.hu |language=hu |access-date=23 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The picture is painted with oil paints and has dimensions of 200 × 192&amp;nbsp;cm.  The picture is in the [[Hungarian National Gallery]] in [[Budapest]].

It is one of the most iconic paintings in Hungarian painting. After 40 years Tivadar Costco Chontvari left pharmaceuticals and took up art. He traveled thousands of miles in search of inspiration. The picture of cedar trees painted in Lebanon while on pilgrimage is a key part of his work. The symbolism stems from the strong religious character. According to the ancient  beliefs, cedars play an important role in ancient Hungarian mythology.&lt;ref name="europeana.eu"/&gt; The cedar is a symbol of fertility, assumed to be the tree of life and the tree of knowledge.&lt;ref name="hung-art.hu"/&gt;

In his painting, Chontvari presents his outlook, which is reflected in the art.&lt;ref name="europeana.eu"/&gt; It is a complex system of symbols, and synthesizes diverse content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mng.hu/kiallitasok/allando/178/128 |title=Csontváry Kosztka Tivadar - Zarándoklás a cédrusokhoz Libanonban |language=hu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''planning fallacy''', first proposed by [[Daniel Kahneman]] and [[Amos Tversky]] in 1979,&lt;ref name="PezzoLitman2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pezzo|first1=Mark V.|last2=Litman|first2=Jordan A.|last3=Pezzo|first3=Stephanie P.|title=On the distinction between yuppies and hippies: Individual differences in prediction biases for planning future tasks |journal=Personality and Individual Differences|volume=41|issue=7|year=2006|pages=1359–1371|issn=0191-8869|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2006.03.029}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Daniel |last1=Kahneman |first2=Amos |last2=Tversky |title=Intuitive prediction: biases and corrective procedures |journal= TIMS Studies in Management Science|volume=12 |year=1979| pages=313–327}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a phenomenon in which predictions about how much time will be needed to complete a future task display an [[optimism bias]] and underestimate the time needed.

This phenomenon occurs regardless of the individual's knowledge that past tasks of a similar nature have taken longer to complete than generally planned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://homepages.se.edu/cvonbergen/files/2013/01/Exploring-the-Planning-Fallacy_Why-People-Underestimate-Their-Task-Completion-Times.pdf|title = Exploring the Planning Fallacy|date = 1994|accessdate = 7 November 2014|website = |publisher = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://ll3md4hy6n.scholar.serialssolutions.com/?sid=google&amp;auinit=J&amp;aulast=Kruger&amp;atitle=If+you+don%27t+want+to+be+late,+enumerate:+Unpacking+reduces+the+planning+fallacy&amp;id=doi:10.1016/j.jesp.2003.11.001&amp;title=Journal+of+experimental+social+psychology&amp;volume=40&amp;issue=5&amp;date=2004&amp;spage=586&amp;issn=0022-1031|title = If you don't want to be late, enumerate: Unpacking Reduces the Planning Fallacy|date = 15 October 2003|accessdate = 7 November 2014|website = |publisher = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://eds.a.ebscohost.com.gate.lib.buffalo.edu/ehost/detail/detail?vid=53&amp;sid=d2c8483c-7954-4367-a1cc-d4e1934f7fbb%40sessionmgr4002&amp;hid=4105&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl#db=psyh&amp;AN=2000-12567-007|title = Overcoming the Planning Fallacy Through Willpower|date = November 2000|accessdate = 22 November 2014|website = |publisher = European Journal of Social Psychology|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The bias only affects predictions about one's own tasks; when outside observers predict task completion times, they show a pessimistic bias, overestimating the time needed.&lt;ref name="buehlerHandB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="abouttime" /&gt; The planning fallacy requires that predictions of current tasks' completion times are more optimistic than the beliefs about past completion times for similar projects and that predictions of the current tasks' completion times are more optimistic than the actual time needed to complete the tasks. In 2003, Lovallo and Kahneman proposed an expanded definition as the tendency to underestimate the time, costs, and risks of future actions and at the same time overestimate the benefits of the same actions. According to this definition, the planning fallacy results in not only time overruns, but also [[cost overruns]] and [[benefit shortfall]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lovallo |first=Dan |author2=Daniel Kahneman  |date=July 2003 |title=Delusions of Success: How Optimism Undermines Executives' Decisions |journal=Harvard Business Review |pages=56–63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Empirical evidence ==

=== For individual tasks ===
In a 1994 study, 37 [[psychology]] students were asked to estimate how long it would take to finish their [[senior thesis|senior theses]]. The average estimate was 33.9 days. They also estimated how long it would take "if everything went as well as it possibly could" (averaging 27.4 days) and "if everything went as poorly as it possibly could" (averaging 48.6 days). The average actual completion time was 55.5 days, with only about 30% of the students completing their thesis in the amount of time they predicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.67.3.366 |last=Buehler |first=Roger |author2=Dale Griffin |author3=Michael Ross  |year=1994 |title= Exploring the "planning fallacy": Why people underestimate their task completion times |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |publisher=American Psychological Association |volume=67 |pages= 366–381 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study asked students to estimate when they would complete their personal academic projects. Specifically, the researchers asked for estimated times by which the students thought it was 50%, 75%, and 99% probable their personal projects would be done.&lt;ref name="abouttime"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/14792779343000112 |last=Buehler |first=Roger |author2=Dale Griffin |author3=Michael Ross  |year=1995 |title=It's about time: Optimistic predictions in work and love |journal=European Review of Social Psychology |publisher=American Psychological Association |volume=6 |pages=1–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 13% of subjects finished their project by the time they had assigned a 50% probability level;
* 19% finished by the time assigned a 75% probability level;
* 45% finished by the time of their 99% probability level.

A survey of Canadian tax payers, published in 1997, found that they mailed in their tax forms about a week later than they predicted. They had no misconceptions about their past record of getting forms mailed in, but expected that they would get it done more quickly next time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Buehler |first=Roger |author2=Dale Griffin |author3=Johanna Peetz  |year=2010 |title=The Planning Fallacy: Cognitive, Motivational, and Social Origins |journal=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology |publisher=Academic Press |volume=43 |pages=9 |url=http://www.psych.nyu.edu/trope/Ledgerwood%20et%20al_Advances%20chapter.PDF#page=10 |accessdate=2012-09-15 |doi=10.1016/s0065-2601(10)43001-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This illustrates a defining feature of the planning fallacy; that people recognize that their past predictions have been over-optimistic, while insisting that their current predictions are realistic.&lt;ref name="buehlerHandB" /&gt;

=== For group tasks ===
Carter and colleagues conducted three studies in 2005 that demonstrate empirical support that the planning fallacy also affects predictions concerning group tasks. This research emphasizes the importance of how temporal frames and thoughts of successful completion contribute to the planning fallacy.&lt;ref name=Sanna-2005/&gt;

=== Additional studies ===
[[Bent Flyvbjerg]] and [[Cass Sunstein]] argue that [[Albert O. Hirschman|Albert O. Hirschman's]] [[Hiding hand principle|Hiding Hand principle]] is the planning fallacy writ large, and they tested the empirical validity of the principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flyvbjerg|first=Bent|last2=Sunstein|first2=Cass R.|date=2015|title=The Principle of the Malevolent Hiding Hand; or, the Planning Fallacy Writ Large|ssrn=2654423|location=Rochester, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; See also further reading below for additional studies.

== Proposed explanations ==
* Kahneman and Tversky originally explained the fallacy by envisaging that planners focus on the most optimistic scenario for the task, rather than using their full experience of how much time similar tasks require.&lt;ref name="buehlerHandB"&gt;Buehler, Roger; Griffin, Dale, &amp; Ross, Michael (2002). "Inside the planning fallacy: The causes and consequences of optimistic time predictions". In Thomas Gilovich, Dale Griffin, &amp; Daniel Kahneman (Eds.), ''Heuristics and biases: The psychology of intuitive judgment'', pp. 250–270. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Roger Buehler and colleagues account for the fallacy by examining [[wishful thinking]]; in other words, people think tasks will be finished quickly and easily because that is what they want to be the case.&lt;ref name="PezzoLitman2006" /&gt;
* In a different paper, Buehler and colleagues suggest an explanation in terms of the [[self-serving bias]] in how people interpret their past performance. By taking credit for tasks that went well but blaming delays on outside influences, people can discount past evidence of how long a task should take.&lt;ref name="PezzoLitman2006" /&gt; One experiment found that when people made their predictions anonymously, they do not show the optimistic bias. This suggests that the people make optimistic estimates so as to create a favorable impression with others,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pezzoa | first1 = Stephanie P. | last2 = Pezzob | first2 = Mark V. | last3 = Stone | first3 = Eric R. | year = | title = The social implications of planning: How public predictions bias future plans | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 2006 | issue = | pages = 221–227 | doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2005.03.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is similar to the concepts outlined in [[impression management]] theory.
* Another explanation proposed by Roy and colleagues is that people do not correctly recall the amount of time that similar tasks in the past had taken to complete; instead people systematically underestimate the duration of those past events. Thus, a prediction about future event duration is biased because memory of past event duration is also biased. Roy and colleagues note that this memory bias does not rule out other mechanisms of the planning fallacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roy|first=Michael M.|last2=Christenfeld|first2=Nicholas J. S.|last3=McKenzie|first3=Craig R. M.|title=Underestimating the Duration of Future Events: Memory Incorrectly Used or Memory Bias?|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/0033-2909.131.5.738|journal=Psychological Bulletin|language=en|volume=131|issue=5|pages=738–756|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.131.5.738}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Sanna and colleagues examined temporal framing and thinking about success as a contributor to the planning fallacy. They found that when people were induced to think about a deadline as far away (i.e., lots of time remaining) vs. rapidly approaching (i.e., little time remaining), they made more optimistic predictions and had more thoughts of success. In their final study, they found that the ease of generating thoughts also caused more optimistic predictions. &lt;ref name=Sanna-2005&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sanna|first=Lawrence J.|last2=Parks|first2=Craig D.|last3=Chang|first3=Edward C.|last4=Carter|first4=Seth E.|title=The Hourglass Is Half Full or Half Empty: Temporal Framing and the Group Planning Fallacy.|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/1089-2699.9.3.173|journal=Group Dynamics: Theory, Research, and Practice| year=2005 |volume=9|issue=3|pages=173–188|doi=10.1037/1089-2699.9.3.173}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* One explanation, [[focalism]], proposes that people fall victim to the planning fallacy because they only focus on the future task and do not consider similar tasks of the past that took longer to complete than expected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://eds.a.ebscohost.com.gate.lib.buffalo.edu/ehost/detail/detail?vid=12&amp;sid=d2c8483c-7954-4367-a1cc-d4e1934f7fbb%40sessionmgr4002&amp;hid=4111&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl#db=psyh&amp;AN=2000-03212-001|title = Focalism: A source of durability bias in affective forecasting.|date = May 2000|accessdate = 21 November 2014|website = |publisher = American Psychological Association|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* As described by [[Fred Brooks]] in ''[[The Mythical Man-Month]]'', adding new personnel to an already-late project incurs a variety of risks and overhead costs that tend to make it even later; this is known as [[Brooks's law]].
* The "authorization imperative" offers another possible explanation: much of project planning takes place in a context which requires financial approval to proceed with the project, and the planner often has a stake in getting the project approved. This dynamic may lead to a tendency on the part of the planner to deliberately underestimate the project effort required. It is easier to get forgiveness (for overruns) than permission (to commence the project if a realistic effort estimate were provided). Such deliberate underestimation has been named by Jones and Euske "strategic misrepresentation".&lt;ref name="jpart-jones-1991"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jones,|first1=Larry R|last2=Euske|first2=Kenneth J |title=Strategic misrepresentation in budgeting|journal=Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory|date=October 1991|volume=1|issue=4|pages=437–460
|url=http://jpart.oxfordjournals.org/content/1/4/437
|accessdate=11 March 2013
|publisher=Oxford University Press
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Apart from psychological explanations, the phenomenon of the planning fallacy has also been explained by [[Nassim Nicholas Taleb|Taleb]] as resulting from natural [[asymmetry]] and from [[scale (ratio)|scaling]] issues.  The asymmetry results from random events giving negative results of delay or cost, not evenly balanced between positive and negative results.  The scaling difficulties relate to the observation that consequences of disruptions are not [[linear]], that as size of effort increases the error increases much more as a natural effect of inefficiencies of larger efforts' ability to react, particularly efforts that are not divisible in increments.  Additionally this is contrasted with earlier efforts being more commonly on-time (e.g. the [[Empire State Building]], [[The Crystal Palace]], the [[Golden Gate Bridge]]) to conclude it indicates inherent flaws in more modern planning systems and modern efforts having hidden fragility. (For example, that modern efforts – being computerized and less localized invisibly – have less insight and control, and more dependencies on transportation.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods for counteracting ==

=== Segmentation effect ===
The segmentation effect is defined as the time allocated for a task being significantly smaller than the sum of the time allocated to individual smaller sub-tasks of that task. In a study performed by Forsyth in 2008, this effect was tested to determine if it could be used to reduce the planning fallacy. In three experiments, the segmentation effect was shown to be influential. However, the segmentation effect demands a great deal of cognitive resources and is not very feasible to use in everyday situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758%2FMC.36.4.791|title = Allocating time to future tasks: The effect of task segmentation on planning fallacy bias|date = June 2008|accessdate = 7 November 2014|journal = Memory &amp; Cognition|doi=10.3758/MC.36.4.791|volume=36|pages=791–798 | last1 = Forsyth | first1 = D. K.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Implementation intentions ===
[[Implementation intention]]s are concrete plans that accurately show how, when, and where one will act. It has been shown through various experiments that implementation intentions help people become more aware of the overall task and see all possible outcomes. Initially, this actually causes predictions to become even more optimistic. However, it is believed that forming implementation intentions "explicitly recruits willpower" by having the person commit themselves to the completion of the task. Those that had formed implementation intentions during the experiments began work on the task sooner, experienced fewer interruptions, and later predictions had reduced optimistic bias than those who had not. It was also found that the reduction in optimistic bias was mediated by the reduction in interruptions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Reference class forecasting ===
[[Reference class forecasting]] predicts the outcome of a planned action based on actual outcomes in a reference class of similar actions to that being forecast.

== Real-world examples ==
[[File:Sydney Opera House - construction - phase 2 1966.jpg|thumb|Sydney Opera House, still under construction in 1966, three years after its expected completion date]]
The [[Sydney Opera House]] was expected to be completed in 1963. A scaled-down version opened in 1973, a decade later. The original cost was estimated at $7 million, but its delayed completion led to a cost of $102 million.&lt;ref name=Sanna-2005/&gt;

The [[Eurofighter Typhoon]] defense project took six years longer than expected, with an overrun cost of 8 billion euros.&lt;ref name=Sanna-2005/&gt;

The [[Central Artery|Boston Central Artery]] was completed seven years later than planned, costing another $12 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.pogo.org/our-work/reports/90s/tr-bigdig-19950201.html|title = No Light at the End of his Tunnel: Boston's Central Artery/Third Harbor Tunnel Project|date = 1 February 1995|accessdate = 7 November 2014|website = |publisher = Project on Government Oversight|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Denver International Airport]] opened sixteen months later than scheduled, with a total cost of $4.8 billion, over $2 billion more than expected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GAOREPORTS-AIMD-95-230/pdf/GAOREPORTS-AIMD-95-230.pdf|title = Denver International Airport|date = September 1995|accessdate = 7 November 2014|website = |publisher = United States General Accounting Office|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6347">A '''population model''' is a type of [[mathematical model]] that is applied to the study of [[population dynamics]]. 

==Rationale==

[[Mathematical model|Model]]s allow a better understanding of how complex interactions and processes work. Modeling of dynamic interactions in nature can provide a manageable way of understanding how numbers change over time or in relation to each other. Many patterns can be noticed by using population modeling as a tool.&lt;ref name="Worster"&gt;{{cite book|last = Worster|first = Donald|title = Nature's Economy|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 1994|pages = 398–401}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Ecological]] population modeling is concerned with the changes in parameters such as [[population size]] and [[age distribution]] within a population. This might be due to interactions with the environment, individuals of their own species, or other species.&lt;ref name="Uyenoyama"&gt;{{cite book|last = Uyenoyama|first = Marcy|title = The Evolution of Population Biology |editor=Rama Singh |publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2004|pages = 1–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Population models are used to determine maximum harvest for agriculturists, to understand the dynamics of [[biological invasion]]s, and for [[environmental conservation]]. Population models are also used to understand the spread of parasites, viruses, and [[disease spread|disease]].&lt;ref name="Uyenoyama"/&gt;

Another way populations models are useful are when species become endangered. Population models can track the fragile species and work and curb the decline. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1447430?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents]  

== History ==
Late 18th-century biologists began to develop techniques in population modeling in order to understand dynamics of growing and shrinking ball populations of living organisms. [[Thomas Malthus]] was one of the first to note that populations grew with a geometric pattern while contemplating the fate of humankind.&lt;ref name = "McIntosh"&gt;{{cite book|last = McIntosh|first = Robert|title = The Background of Ecology|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 1985|pages = 171–198}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most basic and milestone models of population growth was the [[logistic model of population growth]] formulated by [[Pierre François Verhulst]] in 1838. The logistic model takes the shape of a [[sigmoid curve]] and describes the growth of a population as exponential, followed by a decrease in growth, and bound by a carrying capacity due to environmental pressures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Renshaw|first = Eric|title = Modeling Biological Populations in Space and Time|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 1991|pages = 6–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Population modeling became of particular interest to biologists in the 20th century as pressure on limited means of sustenance due to increasing human populations in parts of Europe were noticed by biologist like [[Raymond Pearl]]. In 1921 Pearl invited physicist [[Alfred J. Lotka]] to assist him in his lab. Lotka developed paired [[differential equation]]s that showed the effect of a parasite on its prey. Mathematician [[Vito Volterra]] equated the relationship between two species independent from Lotka. Together, Lotka and Volterra formed the [[Lotka–Volterra equation|Lotka–Volterra model]] for competition that applies the logistic equation to two species illustrating competition, predation, and parasitism interactions between species.&lt;ref name="McIntosh"/&gt; In 1939 contributions to population modeling were given by Patrick Leslie as he began work in biomathematics. Leslie emphasized the importance of constructing a life table in order to understand the effect that key life history strategies played in the dynamics of whole populations. Matrix algebra was used by Leslie in conjunction with life tables to extend the work of Lotka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Kingsland|first = Sharon|title = Modeling Nature: Episodes in the History of Population Ecology|publisher = University of Chicago Press|year = 1995|pages = 127–146}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Matrix population models|Matrix models]] of populations calculate the growth of a population with life history variables. Later, [[Robert MacArthur]] and [[E. O. Wilson]] characterized island biogeography. The [[Ecology#Biogeography|equilibrium model of island biogeography]] describes the number of species on an island as an equilibrium of immigration and extinction. The logistic population model, the Lotka–Volterra model of community ecology, life table matrix modeling, the equilibrium model of island biogeography and variations thereof are the basis for ecological population modeling today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Gotelli|first = Nicholas|title = A Primer of Ecology|publisher = Sinauer|year = 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Equations ==

[[Logistic growth]] equation:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{dN}{dt} = rN\left(1-\frac{N}{K}\right)\,&lt;/math&gt;

[[Lotka-Volterra equation]]:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{dN_1}{dt} = r_1 N_1\frac{K_1-N_1 - \alpha N_2}{K_1}\,&lt;/math&gt;

[[Island biogeography]]:

: &lt;math&gt;S = \frac{IP}{I+E}&lt;/math&gt;

[[Species–area relationship]]:

The '''science of man''' (or the '''science of human nature''') is a topic in [[David Hume]]'s 18th century experimental philosophy ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]'' (1739). The science of man expanded the understanding of facets of human nature, including [[sense]]s, impressions, ideas, imagination, passions, [[morality]], justice, and society.

The science of man first established that impressions from the senses, and memories of impressions, are the foundation of all ideas. [[Passion (emotion)|Passions]] are a part of human nature and they rule over our reason in determining our actions. Morality is based on necessary actions, those we make in reaction to a certain set of circumstances, and is therefore natural.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Treatise of human nature being an attempt to introduce the experimental method of reasoning into moral subjects|last=Hume|first=David|publisher=Kitchener, Ont. : Batoche|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=192-313}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, morality is founded on self-interest, which includes the pleasure we find in sensing the pleasure in others.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals|last=Hume|first=David|publisher=Hackett Publishing Company|year=1983|isbn=0915145464|editor-last=Schneewind|editor-first=J.B.|location=Indianapolis- Cambridge|pages=79-81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hume identifies sympathy as a passion that causes us to feel for other humans because of their similarity to us. This includes our tendency to feel, to some degree, emotions that we observe in other humans. Man has been naturally inclined to develop the rules of justice over time in order to maximize pleasure. Given the tendency of self-interest to overpower the pleasure felt through sympathy, the eventual accumulation of wealth necessitated the development of some form of government, initially somewhat monarchical, to ensure that the rules of justice were followed. Hume bases his further discussions of humans as individuals and in society in ''A Treatise of Human Nature'' on the initial premises set by his ''science of man.''

''A Treatise on Human Nature'' and later works influenced other [[Philosophy|philosophers]], such as [[Adam Smith]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], and [[Immanuel Kant]]—especially in discussions of morality and cause and effect.

=== Relationship Between Passion and Reason ===
The passions are a subgroup of impressions which in themselves are used to categorize the “perception of the mind”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; . Impressions are divided into two groups, Original impressions that represent instinctual senses that all humans are born with. Secondary(reflective) impressions represents passions and arise directly from original impressions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;The passions are divided into two categories, "direct passions" which are the raw emotional state human being experience when under  intense emotions. "Indirect Passions" are of the same principles of direct passions but have gained additional complexity to them.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Hume makes the distinction that in the relationship between passion and reason, passion shall always supersede the former. He first states that passion is the raw emotion that proceeds in the mind whenever someone is faced with "pleasure and pain".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Reason alone cannot provide man the impulse to perform action, but passions that come from emotions that cause us to "avoid or embrace" an object can provide this purpose&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. Reason than is tool used to understand how the source of the emotion may affect the person themselves and guide them to react to said object.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Reason alone cannot prevent nor stop a passion from proceeding. Reason has no capability of creating the impulse to act, thus if reason alone cannot act, it cannot oppose a passion.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

When one feels passion, that is the raw emotional state that all judgments that proceed from that state shall be based off.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Thus passion cannot be "reasonable or unreasonable" because all judgments made shall originate from this passion. What can makes a passion unreasonable is not the passion itself but the ideas that form around that emotional state.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Relationship Between Morality and Self Interest ===
Morality is not based on reason because reason itself does not have the capacity to create action.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Treatise of human nature being an attempt to introduce the experimental method of reasoning into moral subjects|last=Hume|first=David|publisher=Kitchener, Ont. : Batoche|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=192-313}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A system of virtue is favorable to humans because it is created with self interest, if anyone were to join this system, they do so in the pursuit that the system will work for them. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;Secondarily following this system of morality creates passion of pleasure by allowing humans to present themselves better than others through their virtues &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. They receive enjoyment through praise and continue to do so in order to receive further praise. Thus humans through envy shall try to receive the same pleasures as well, leading to a more moral society. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Francis Crick]] in 1958.{{sfn|Crick|1958}} It states that the sequence of bases in the genetic material ([[DNA]] or [[RNA]]) determines the sequence of [[amino acid]]s for which that segment of nucleic acid codes, and this amino acid sequence determines the three-dimensional structure into which the [[protein]] folds. The three-dimensional structure of a protein is required for a protein to be functional. This hypothesis then lays the essential link between information stored and inherited in nucleic acids to the chemical processes which enable life to exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Brenner | first1 = Sydney | authorlink1 = Sydney Brenner| title = Retrospective [[Frederick Sanger]] (1918-2013) | doi = 10.1126/science.1249912 | journal = Science | volume = 343 | issue = 6168 | pages = 262 | year = 2014 | pmid =  24436413| pmc = | bibcode = 2014Sci...343..262B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Or, as Crick put it in 1958:

{{pull quote|text=In its simplest form it [the Sequence Hypothesis] assumes that the specificity of a piece of [[nucleic acid]] is expressed solely by the sequence of its [[base pair|bases]], and that this sequence is a (simple) code for the amino acid sequence of a particular protein.

This hypothesis appears to be rather widely held. Its virtue is that it unites several remarkable pairs of generalisations: the central biochemical importance of proteins and the dominating role of [[genes]], and in particular of their nucleic acid; the linearity of protein molecules (considered covalently) and the genetic linearity within the functional gene [...]; the simplicity of the composition of protein molecules and the simplicity of the nucleic acids. |author=Francis Crick{{sfn|Crick|1958|p=152}} }}

This description is further amplified in the article and, in discussing how a protein folds up into its three-dimensional structure, Crick suggested that "the ''folding is simply a function of the order of the amino acids''" in the protein.{{sfn|Crick|1958|p=144}}

'''Signal-to-Quantization-Noise Ratio''' ('''SQNR''' or '''SN&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;R''') is widely used quality measure in analysing [[digitizing]] schemes such as PCM ([[Pulse-code modulation|pulse code modulation]]) and [[multimedia codec]]s. The SQNR reflects the relationship between the maximum nominal [[signal strength]] and the [[quantization error]] (also known as quantization noise)  introduced in the [[analog-to-digital conversion]].

The SQNR formula is derived from the general SNR ([[signal-to-noise ratio|Signal-to-Noise Ratio]]) formula for the binary pulse-code [[Modulation|modulated]] [[Channel (communications)|communication channel]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SNR}=\frac{3 \times 2^{2n}}{1+4P_e \times (2^{2n} - 1)} \frac{m_m(t)^2}{m_p(t)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;P_e&lt;/math&gt; is the probability of received bit error
:&lt;math&gt;m_p(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the peak message signal level
:&lt;math&gt;m_m(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the mean message signal level

As SQNR applies to quantized signals, the formulae for SQNR refer to discrete-time digital signals. Instead of &lt;math&gt;m(t)&lt;/math&gt;, we will use the digitized signal &lt;math&gt;x(n)&lt;/math&gt;. For &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; quantization steps, each sample, &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; requires &lt;math&gt;\nu=\log_2 N&lt;/math&gt; bits. The [[probability distribution function]] (pdf) representing the distribution of values in &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and can be denoted as &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;. The maximum magnitude value of any &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is denoted by &lt;math&gt;x_{max}&lt;/math&gt;.

As SQNR, like SNR, is a ratio of signal power to some noise power, it can be calculated as:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SQNR} = \frac{P_{signal}}{P_{noise}} = \frac{E[x^2]}{E[\tilde{x}^2]}&lt;/math&gt;
The signal power is:
:&lt;math&gt;\overline{x^2} = E[x^2] = P_{x^\nu}=\int_{}^{}x^2f(x)dx&lt;/math&gt; 
The quantization noise power can be expressed as:
:&lt;math&gt;E[\tilde{x}^2] = \frac{x_{max}^2}{3\times4^\nu}&lt;/math&gt;
Giving:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SQNR} = \frac{3 \times 4^\nu\times \overline{x^2}}{x_{max}^2}&lt;/math&gt;

When the SQNR is desired in terms of [[Decibels|Decibels (dB)]], a useful approximation to SQNR is:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SQNR}|_{dB}=P_{x^\nu}+6\nu+4.8&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; is the number of bits in a quantized sample, and &lt;math&gt;P_{x^\nu}&lt;/math&gt; is the signal power calculated above. Note that for each bit added to a sample, the SQNR goes up by approximately 6dB (&lt;math&gt;20\times log_{10}(2)&lt;/math&gt;).

'''Smart Parks''' is an organisation which focuses on supporting conservation and anti poaching using modern technology.

==History==
Smart Parks  was formed by the merger of two charities [[ShadowView]] and Internet of Life in 2017. The organisation operates as a registered [[Charitable organisation|charity]] in the [[UK]] and a [[Stichting]] with a [[Social Enterprise]] model limited company in the [[Netherlands]]. 
The mission of Smart Parks is to utilise technology to assist in [[Anti-poaching]] and park management across the world. The primary operational focus is to create a network of sensors and technologies that allows permanent live monitoring of assets in the park that is being protected. 
In 2017 Rwanda’s [[Akagera National Park]] launched the Smart Parks technology which allows park rangers to monitor animals, visitors, and equipment in real-time. The Smart Parks system is based on the [[LoRa]] technology a Long Range Wide-Area Network (LoRaWAN) with low-bandwidth, low-power networking technology that can blanket large areas at relatively low costs.&lt;ref name="The Verge"&gt;{{Cite news|title=High Tech plan to combat poachers|url=http://www.theverge.com/2017/7/20/16002752/smart-park-rwanda-akagera-poaching-lorawan.html|publisher=The Verge.com.|date=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operations==
In January 2017 The Internet of Life and the [[ShadowView]] Foundation organisations co-developed a [[LoRa]]-equipped sensor that is implanted directly into a [[rhinoceros]] horn for protection against poaching in [[Akagera National Park]]. The sensor has given park rangers the ability to accurately monitor the whereabouts and activities of the critically endangered black rhinos and keep them safe from wildlife criminals and poachers. The LoRa-equipped tracking sensor is part of a comprehensive LoRaWAN™-based [[Internet of things|IoT]] security solution utilised by Smart Parks&lt;ref name="Park rangers use IoT"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Park rangers use IoT in mission to save endangered black rhinos|url=https://internetofbusiness.com/park-rangers-use-iot-tech-to-save-the-endangered-black-rhino//|publisher=Internet Of Business|date=29 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is now being deployed throughout [[Mkomazi National Park]] and many other locations. &lt;ref name="Nasdaq Global Newswire"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Semtech LoRa Technology Tracks Location of Endangered Black Rhinos in Africa|url=https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2017/01/17/906237/0/en/Semtech-LoRa-Technology-Tracks-Location-of-Endangered-Black-Rhinos-in-Africa.html|publisher=GlobeNewswire.com.|date=17 Jan 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Smart Parks has installed its fourth and largest African smart park to date in Malawi's [[Liwonde National Park]] in October 2018.
In just two weeks, the 548km2 national park was equipped with gateways and sensors that gather information to help improve park management and protection. The construction of the network in the [[Liwonde National Park]] was implemented alongside a team from [[African Parks]], a conservation NGO that manages the park on behalf of the Malawian government. The group was trained by Smart Parks for the construction of the site &lt;ref name="New Smart Park in Africa"&gt;{{Cite news|title=See How This New Smart Park in Africa Could Help Rangers Curb Poaching|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jenniferhicks/2018/11/07/see-how-this-new-smart-park-in-africa-could-help-rangers-curb-poaching/#138f2f063180|publisher=Forbes.com |date=7 Nov 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The '''sociological study of [[peace]], [[war]], and [[social conflict]]''' entails the use of [[sociological theory]] and methods to analyze [[group conflict]]s, especially [[collective violence]] and alternative constructive nonviolent forms of [[conflict transformation]].  

The [[by-law|by-laws]] of the Section on Peace, War and Social Conflict of the [[American Sociological Association]] specify:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.asanet.org/sectionpwsc/sectinfo.html What is the Peace, War, and Social Conflict Section?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110911102238/http://www2.asanet.org/sectionpwsc/sectinfo.html |date=2011-09-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The purpose of the Section on Peace, War, and Social Conflict is to foster the development and application of sociological theories and methods for the understanding and study of dynamics of collective conflict and its prevention, conduct, and resolution. Included is the study of military institutions and conflict between collectivities such as countries, ethnic groups, political movements, and religious groups. Also included are the roles of military organizations, other governmental organizations, non-governmental organizations, and social movements.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5781">In [[mathematics]], more precisely in [[differential geometry]], a '''soldering''' (or sometimes '''solder form''') of a [[fiber bundle]] to a [[smooth manifold]] is a manner of attaching the fibres to the manifold in such a way that they can be regarded as tangent.  Intuitively, soldering expresses in abstract terms the idea that a manifold may have a point of [[contact (mathematics)|contact]] with a certain model [[Klein geometry]] at each point.  In extrinsic differential geometry, the soldering is simply expressed by the tangency of the model space to the manifold.  In intrinsic geometry, other techniques are needed to express it.  Soldering was introduced in this general form by [[Charles Ehresmann]] in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;Kobayashi (1957).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soldering of a fibre bundle==
Let ''M'' be a smooth manifold, and ''G'' a [[Lie group]], and let ''E'' be a smooth fibre bundle over ''M'' with structure group ''G''.  Suppose that ''G'' [[group action|acts transitively]] on the typical fibre ''F'' of ''E'', and that dim ''F'' = dim ''M''.  A '''soldering''' of ''E'' to ''M'' consists of the following data:
# A distinguished [[section (fiber bundle)|section]]  ''o'' : ''M'' → ''E''.
# A linear isomorphism of vector bundles θ : T''M'' → ''o''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;V''E'' from the [[tangent bundle]] of ''M'' to the [[pullback bundle|pullback]] of the [[vertical bundle]] of ''E'' along the distinguished section.
In particular, this latter condition can be interpreted as saying that θ determines a linear isomorphism
:&lt;math&gt;\theta_x : T_xM\rightarrow V_{o(x)} E&lt;/math&gt;
from the tangent space of ''M'' at ''x'' to the (vertical) tangent space of the fibre at the point determined by the distinguished section.  The form θ is called the '''solder form''' for the soldering.

==Special cases==

===Affine bundles and vector bundles===
Suppose that ''E'' is an affine [[vector bundle]] (a vector bundle without a choice of zero section).  Then a soldering on ''E'' specifies first a ''distinguished section'': that is, a choice of zero section ''o'', so that ''E'' may be identified as a vector bundle.  The solder form is then a linear isomorphism
:&lt;math&gt;\theta\colon TM \to V_oE,&lt;/math&gt;
However, for a vector bundle there is a canonical isomorphism between the vertical space at the origin and the fibre V&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;''E'' ≈ ''E''.  Making this identification, the solder form is specified by a linear isomorphism
:&lt;math&gt;TM \to E.&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, a soldering on an [[affine bundle]] ''E'' is a choice of isomorphism of ''E'' with the tangent bundle of ''M''.

Often one speaks of a ''solder form on a vector bundle'', where it is understood ''a priori'' that the distinguished section of the soldering is the zero section of the bundle.  In this case, the structure group of the vector bundle is often implicitly enlarged by the [[semidirect product]] of ''GL''(''n'') with the typical fibre of ''E'' (which is a representation of ''GL''(''n'')).&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Kobayashi (1957) section 11 for a discussion of the companion reduction of the structure group.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Examples====
* As a special case, for instance, the tangent bundle itself carries a canonical solder form, namely the identity.
* If ''M'' has a [[Riemannian metric]] (or [[pseudo-Riemannian metric]]), then the [[covariant metric tensor]] gives an isomorphism &lt;math&gt;g\colon TM \to T^*M&lt;/math&gt; from the tangent bundle to the [[cotangent bundle]], which is a solder form.
* In [[Hamiltonian mechanics]], the solder form is known as the [[tautological one-form]], or alternately as the '''Liouville one-form''', the '''Poincaré one-form''', the '''canonical one-form''', or the '''symplectic potential'''.

====Applications====
A solder form on a vector bundle allows one to define the [[torsion tensor|torsion]] and [[contorsion tensor]]s of a [[connection (vector bundle)|connection]].

===Principal bundles===
In the language of principal bundles, a '''solder form''' on a smooth [[principal bundle|principal ''G''-bundle]] ''P'' over a [[smooth manifold]] ''M'' is a horizontal and ''G''-equivariant [[vector-valued differential form|differential 1-form]] on ''P'' with values in a [[linear representation]] ''V'' of ''G'' such that the associated [[bundle map]] from the [[tangent bundle]] ''TM'' to the [[associated bundle]] ''P''&amp;times;&lt;sub&gt;''G''&lt;/sub&gt; ''V'' is a [[bundle map|bundle isomorphism]]. (In particular, ''V'' and ''M'' must have the same dimension.)

A motivating example of a solder form is the [[frame bundle#Solder form|tautological or fundamental form]] on the [[frame bundle]] of a manifold.

The reason for the name is that a solder form solders (or attaches) the abstract principal bundle to the manifold ''M'' by identifying an associated bundle with the tangent bundle. Solder forms provide a method for studying [[G-structure|''G''-structures]] and are important in the theory of [[Cartan connection]]s. The terminology and approach is particularly popular in the physics literature.

'''Teleological behaviorism''' is a variety of [[behaviorism]]. Like all other forms of [[Behaviorism]] it relies heavily on attention to outwardly observable human behaviors. Similarly to other branches of behaviorism, teleological behaviorism takes into account cognitive processes, like emotions and thoughts, but does not view these as empirical causes of behavior. Teleological behaviorism instead looks at these emotions and thoughts as behaviors themselves. Teleological behaviorism differs from other branches of Behaviorism through its focus on human capacity for self-control and also emphasizes the concept of free will.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Psychologistworld.com|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The founder of teleological behaviorism is [[Howard Rachlin]], an Emeritus Research Professor of Psychology at the [[State University of New York, Stony Brook]]. Originally focusing his work on operant behavior, he eventually became interested in the concepts of free-will as they applied to [[Behavioral Economics]] and turned his interest to the related field of teleological behaviorism from there. A large influence for Rachlin’s work was Aristotle’s early philosophies on the mind, specifically how “Artistotle’s classification of movements in terms of final rather than efficient causes corresponds to [[B.F. Skinner]]’s conception of an operant as a class of movements with a common end”.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Mele|1994|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept that Rachlin is referring to is Artistotle’s concept of [[Telos (philosophy)|Telos]], “the final cause” that drives us all forward towards a common end.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Psychologistworld.com|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rachlin also found heavy inspiration in the writings and work of Tolman and Bandura after their work in Behaviorism. An example of Artistotle’s concept of Telos could come from the concept of drinking water. While most behaviorists would approach drinking water as a direct reaction to being thirsty, Rachlin would also consider the long-term effects and consider that the person is drinking water so that they do not eventually die of thirst. This far-sighted view offers a different viewpoint into the behaviors of human beings that may not be explained as clearly by operant conditioning, a concept of Behavioral Psychology that mostly focuses upon the short-term reactions that someone has learned. 

On the subject of self-control, Rachlin states that it is less of a subject of knowing that one should not do something and more a matter of patience. He considers those with strong self-control simply more “long-term behaviorally-oriented” or “far-sighted.” This concept of considering further implications in the future is related to many other fields, particularly Rachlin’s second interest of Behavioral Economics. He likens the ability to weight the options of the future to avoiding making short-term poor investments in exchange for profitable, more beneficial ones at a much later point in time. 

Many people{{who|date=April 2012}} criticize Rachlin for his perspective, however, as his concepts of simply considering the potential reactions to certain situations over a longer time frame have been hailed as being closer to a self-help practice of making good investments and life choices than it is close to an actual Psychological practice. His main counter to this argument is that through this approach he has managed to help people by preparing them for potential negative outcomes in the future and trained them to recognize their own potential outcomes behind their actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Psychologistworld.com|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rachlin also has a different viewpoint on the subject of [[Free Will]] than most other people. He writes, “the meaning of free will lies not in what may or may not be going on in people’s heads or elsewhere in their bodies, but rather in how the term free will is actually used by the community to describe and to guide overt behavior” {{harv|Rachlin|2007}}. In other words, society’s definitions and expectations are what guide us in terms of what they consider right and wrong as any other external factors do. Our definitions of free-will are contingent upon how much we let them affect our actions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6535">In [[philosophy]], the '''unity of the proposition''' is the problem of explaining how a sentence in the [[indicative mood]] expresses more than just what a list of [[proper name]]s expresses.

== History ==

The problem was discussed under this name by [[Bertrand Russell]], but can be traced back to [[Plato]]. In Plato's ''[[Sophist_(dialogue)|Sophist]]'', the simplest kind of sentence consists of just a proper name and a [[Universality (philosophy)|universal]] [[terminology|term]] (i.e. a [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]]). The name refers to or picks out some [[individual]] [[object (philosophy)|object]], and the predicate then says something about that individual.

The difficulty is to explain how the predicate does this.  If, as Plato thinks, the predicate is the name of some universal [[concept]] or [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/plato-metaphysics/ form], how do we explain how the sentence comes to be [[Truth|true]] or false?  If, for example, "[[Socrates]] is wise" consists of just a name for Socrates, and a name for the universal concept of [[Wisdom]], how could the sentence be true ''or'' false?  In either case, the "Socrates" [[Sign (linguistics)|signifies]] Socrates, and the predicate signifies Wisdom.  But the sentence ''[[Logical assertion|asserts]]'' that Socrates is wise.  The assertion of wisdom must consist in the assertion of some relation between Socrates and Wisdom.  What is this relation?

The problem was discussed much later by [[F. H. Bradley|Francis Bradley]].  If we assume that a sentence consists of two objects and a relation that connects them, and we represent this by three names, say John, loving, Mary, how do we express the fact that John loves Mary?  For "John", "loving" and "Mary" would name the objects they do, even if this were not a fact.  This is known as [[Bradley's regress]].

== Frege, Russell, Wittgenstein ==

The problem became significant in the early development of [[set theory]].  Set membership is a [[Formal set theory|formal]] [[Knowledge representation|representation]] of the relation between the two parts of the proposition, and there are certain philosophical problems connected with this, as [[Frege]] realised when he investigated the distinction between [[concept and object]].  Assume that "Shergar is a horse" analyses into what "Shergar" names (an "Object", according to Frege), and what "is a horse" names (a "Concept").  Objects are fundamentally different from concepts, otherwise we get the problem of the unity of the proposition.  A predicate cannot function as the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] of a sentence.  But what are we doing when we talk about the concept ''is a horse''? Aren't we using the expression "the concept ''is a horse''", and isn't that a subject expression, which refers (on Frege's account) to an Object? Yes, says Frege, and on that account the concept ''is a horse'' is not a concept at all. This is a [[dogma]] that even Frege's most faithful followers found difficult to swallow.

The difficulty was discussed in detail in ''[[Principia Mathematica|The Principles of Mathematics]]'' by Russell, who saw no resolution.

:There appears to be an ultimate notion of assertion, given by the verb, which is lost as soon as we substitute a verbal noun, and is lost when the proposition in question is made the subject of some other proposition. ...Thus the contradiction which was to have been avoided, of an entity which cannot be made a logical subject, appears to have here become inevitable.  This difficulty, which seems to be inherent in the very nature of truth and falsehood, is one with which I do not know how to deal with satisfactorily.  ...I therefore leave this question to the [[logic]]ians with the above brief indication of a difficulty. (§ 52)

Consider e.g. "A differs from B".  The constituents of this proposition are simply A, difference and B.  The proposition relates A and B, using the words "is ... from" in "A is different from B".  But if we represent this contribution by words for relations, as e.g. "A &lt;R&gt; difference &lt;R&gt; B" we are back to a list of terms, we are essentially back at Bradley's regress.
	
: A proposition, in fact, is essentially a ''unity'', and when analysis has destroyed the unity, no enumeration of constituents will restore the proposition. The verb, when used as a verb, embodies the unity of the proposition, and is thus distinguishable from the verb considered as a term, though I do not know how to give a clear account of the distinction. (§ 52)

[[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] addresses the problem early on in the ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]''.  In section 2.01 he claims that "states of affairs" are combinations of objects. In section 2.03 he explains that nothing is needed to link the objects, since the objects ''hang together''.  The arrangement of words that in the sentence corresponds to the arrangement or ''structure'' of objects in the [[State of affairs (philosophy)|state of affairs]] expressed by the sentence. This is the so-called [[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus#The picture theory|picture theory of the proposition]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5833">'''VinyLoop''' is a proprietary physical [[plastic recycling]] process for [[polyvinyl chloride]] (PVC). It is based on dissolution in order to separate PVC from other materials or impurities.&lt;ref name="VL About"&gt;{{cite web |title=VinyLoop - About us |url=http://www.vinyloop.com/en/about-us.html |publisher=VinyLoop Ferrara SpA |accessdate=16 September 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180916040228/http://www.vinyloop.com/en/about-us.html |archivedate=16 September 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
A major factor of the [[recycling]] of [[polyvinyl chloride]] waste is the purity of the recycled material. In most composite materials, PVC is among several other materials, such as wood, metal, or textile. To make new products from the recycled PVC, it is necessary to separate it from other materials. Traditional recycling methods are not sufficient and expensive because this separation has to be done manually and product by product.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/sectors/chemicals/files/sustdev/pvc_report_en.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-12-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130404075536/http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/sectors/chemicals/files/sustdev/pvc_report_en.pdf |archive-date=2013-04-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

VinyLoop is a recycling process which separates PVC from other materials through a process of dissolution, filtration and separation of contamination. A solvent is used in a closed loop to [[Elution|elute]] PVC from the waste. This makes it possible to recycle composite structure PVC waste, which would normally be incinerated or put in a landfill site.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ifu.com/uploads/tx_ifureference/Umberto_Success_Solvay_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Process ==
The process consists of the following steps:

# Pre-treatment: waste plastics are cleaned, ground and mixed
# Dissolution: a specific solvent is used to selectively dissolve the PVC compound in a closed loop
# Filtration: impurities which have not been dissolved are removed through filtration—they are separated by type of material by filtration, centrifugation and decantation. After separation, the secondary materials are washed with pure solvent to dissolve all remaining PVC compounds
# Precipitation of the regenerated PVC [[Chemical compound|compound]]: the solution of PVC is recovered in a precipitation tank, where steam is injected to evaporate the solvent and precipitate the PVC. The PVC compound is separated in the form of [[Aqueous solution|aqueous]] effluent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=moonlight dancer productions |url=http://www.roofcollect.com/recycling/vinyloop_prozess.cfm?hn_Id=6&amp;sub_Id=185 |title=Roofcollect |language=de |publisher=Roofcollect |date= |accessdate=2012-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Plastics Technology, 8 August 2001, p 58-61: New methods in PVC recycling&lt;/ref&gt; and dried.
# Drying: after recovering the excess water from the slurry, the wet PVC goes to a dryer.

Possible products made from recycled PVC are coatings for waterproofing membranes, pond foils, shoe soles, hoses, diaphragms tunnel, coated fabrics, and PVC sheets. It is an attempt to solve the recycling waste problem of PVC products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.plasticseurope.org/documents/document/20110422155920-vinyl2010__progress_report_2011.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-12-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111218140808/http://www.plasticseurope.org/documents/document/20110422155920-vinyl2010__progress_report_2011.pdf |archive-date=2011-12-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Machine Design, Cleveland, June 5, 2003. vol. 75, Iss. 11; pg. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vinyloop.com&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ecological importance ==
VinyLoop-based recycled PVC's primary energy demand is 46 percent lower than conventional produced PVC. The [[global warming potential]] is 39 percent lower.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=To Recycle or Not to Recycle – PVC Cable Waste is the Question7|url=http://www.knowtheflow.com/2012/to-recycle-or-not-to-recycle-pvc-cable-waste-is-the-question/|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The VinyLoop process has been selected to recycle membranes of different temporary venues of the [[London Olympics 2012]]. Roofing covers of the [[Olympic Stadium (London)|Olympic Stadium]], the [[Water Polo Arena]], the [[London Aquatics Centre]] and the [[Royal Artillery Barracks]] will be deconstructed and a part will be recycled in the VinyLoop process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.wasterecyclingnews.com/article/20120801/NEWS02/120809998/pvc-at-olympics-destined-for-reuse-or-recycling |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-12-08 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121208155043/http://www.wasterecyclingnews.com/article/20120801/NEWS02/120809998/pvc-at-olympics-destined-for-reuse-or-recycling |archive-date=2012-12-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the process could not remove low molecular weight pthalate plasticizers during recycling, tightening EU regulations meant the recycling plant based in Ferrara, Italy has closed as of 28th June 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ferrra Plant Closure Press Release |url=http://www.vinyloop.com/images/PRESS/ClosureVinyloopPressRelease28June2018.pdf |website=VinyLoop |accessdate=29 October 2018 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20181029061135/http://www.vinyloop.com/images/PRESS/ClosureVinyloopPressRelease28June2018.pdf |archivedate=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
