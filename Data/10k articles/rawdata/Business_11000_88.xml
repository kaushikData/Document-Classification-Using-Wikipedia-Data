Prince Abdullah's family on the father's side is directly descended from [[Saud bin Faisal bin Turki|Saud bin Faisal]].&lt;ref name=wasrepme/&gt; Saud's rule as well as that of his brother Abdullah marked the end of [[Second Saudi State|the second Saudi state]] after an invasion of [[Ottomans]] early in the 19th century.&lt;ref name=wasrepme/&gt;

Prince Abdullah received elementary and secondary education in Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref name=sauam/&gt; He then went to the United Kingdom for higher education&lt;ref name=wasrepme/&gt; where he studied engineering.&lt;ref name=eui/&gt;

==Career and activities==
Prince Abdullah's early career as an engineer involved both technical and management positions. He assumed the responsibility of the coordination of various studies for the two industrial cities, and later for the industrial security and safety sector.&lt;ref name=eui/&gt;

Abdullah bin Faisal began his career at the Royal Commission for Jubail and Yanbu immediately after its establishment in 1975.&lt;ref name=eui/&gt; He served as the acting secretary general of the Royal Commission from 1985 to 1987. Then, he was appointed secretary general of the royal commission in 1987.&lt;ref name=sj&gt;{{cite news|title=Saudis confident US presence will prevent Iraq attack|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3TkpAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=NmUFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1484,3825855&amp;dq=abdullah+bin+faisal+bin+turki&amp;hl=en|accessdate=10 December 2012|newspaper=Sun Journal|date=21 August 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Next, he was appointed chairman of the body in 1991 and he served as chief executive officer of the commission and chairman of its board of directors.&lt;ref name=eui/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Royal decrees on ministerial and top-level appointments|url=http://www.saudiembassy.net/archive/1997/news/page137.aspx|work=Saudi Embassy|accessdate=23 June 2012|date=6 July 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
In April 2000, [[Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority|Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority (SAGIA)]] was created, responsible for promotions of the foreign and domestic investments in Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About SAGIA |url=http://www.gcf.org.sa/en/About-GCF/About-SAGIA/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091019191332/http://gcf.org.sa/en/About-GCF/About-SAGIA/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=19 October 2009 |work=Global Competitiveness Forum |accessdate=7 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Simon Henderson| url=http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/uploads/Documents/pubs/PolicyFocus96.pdf|title=After King Abdullah|work=Washington Institute|accessdate=28 July 2012|format=Policy Paper|date=August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prince Abdullah was appointed governor of SAGIA with the rank of minister in 2000.&lt;ref name=eui/&gt;&lt;ref name=ameinfo03&gt;{{cite news|title=Prince Abdullah bin Faisal bin Turki Al Saud |url=http://www.ameinfo.com/23570.html |accessdate=7 June 2012 |work=AMEinfo |date=6 May 2003 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529034728/http://www.ameinfo.com/23570.html |archivedate=29 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His tenure lasted until 2004 when he resigned from this post.&lt;ref name=pbs&gt;{{cite web|title=Wide Angle|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/wideangle/episodes/the-saudi-question/whos-who-the-house-of-saud/prince-abdullah-bin-faisal-bin-turki-al-saud/2885/|work=PBS|accessdate=7 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was speculated that since he was frustrated with the government’s bureaucratic approach and the slow pace of the reforms in the country, he left SAGIA.&lt;ref name=pbs/&gt;

Prince Abdullah was the chairman of Saudi Italian Development Company (SIDCO), charged with the task of revitalizing Saudi Arabia's economy. Since he had knowledge of the Italian economy, he was regarded as the most appropriate figure to support the commercial relations between [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Italy]].&lt;ref name=sidco&gt;{{cite web|title=Board of Directors|url=http://www.sa-sidco.com/English/Mgt.html|work=Saudi Italian Development Company Limited (SIDCO)|accessdate=7 June 2012|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130202194446/http://www.sa-sidco.com/English/Mgt.html|archive-date=2 February 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===SAGIA governorship===
When Prince Abdullah was the governor of SAGIA, he strongly supported both liberal policies and privatization in the Saudi Arabia’s economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Saudi Arabia's New Private Sector Investment Strategies|url=http://www.idcworld.com/saudiprivate.htm|work=International Development Consultants, LLC|accessdate=7 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly 2,000 foreign business licenses were issued during his tenure. The worth of these licenses were estimated to be 15 billion U.S. dollars.&lt;ref name=ameinfo03/&gt;&lt;ref name=pbs/&gt; Prince Abdullah further encouraged the membership of Saudi Arabia to [[the World Trade Organization]].&lt;ref name=pbs/&gt; However, this goal was not achieved at that time because of Saudi Arabia’s protectionist policies towards the industries of oil production and telecommunications, and its inability to produce a formal trade agreement with the United States.&lt;ref name=pbs/&gt;

==Personal life==
Abdullah bin Faisal is married and has four children:&lt;ref name=wasrepme/&gt; Turki, Salman, Elanoude and Sarah.&lt;ref name="alg"/&gt; He is keenly interested in environmental issues and in international relations as well as in the arts.&lt;ref name=eui/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3352">An '''associate attorney''' is a lawyer and an [[employee]] of a [[law firm]] who does not hold an [[ownership]] interest as a [[Law firm#Partnership|partner]].

==Types==

===Practicing attorney===
An associate may be a junior or senior attorney, but normally does not hold an ownership interest in the firm even if associated with the firm for many years. First-year associates are entry-level junior attorneys and are generally recent [[law school]] graduates in their first year of law practice.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{cite book |title = Making Partner: A Guide for Law Firm Associates |first1 = John R. |last = Sapp |first2 = Alexander P. |last2 = Fraser |edition = 3rd |publisher = American Bar Association |year = 2006 |isbn = 978-1-59031-773-0  |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Swc69nT0qMIC |via = [[Google Books]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, an associate has the goal of being made a partner in the firm, after a number of years gaining practice experience and being assigned to increasingly important and remunerative tasks. At firms with an "[[Cravath System|up or out]]" policy, associates who are repeatedly passed over for promotion to partner may be asked to resign. Some firms will also have "non-partner-track" associates who, though performing satisfactorily as employees, for whatever reason, will not be promoted to partner.

Junior attorneys were formerly called "law clerks"; the term "associate attorney" was coined by [[Emory Buckner]], hiring partner of Root, Clark &amp; Bird (which subsequently became [[Dewey Ballantine]]) in the 1920s.{{citation needed|date = October 2011}} The term "[[law clerk]]" now generally refers to an attorney who serves as a research and writing assistant in a judge's chambers, although some law firms use the term to refer to a lawyer or non-lawyer who has specialized knowledge in one of the firm's practice areas but is not classified as a practicing attorney at the law firm.

===Summer associates===
Summer associates are current law students who have usually completed their second year of school (or in some cases, their first year of law school) and are [[internship|interning]] at the firm for the summer. Summer associates have not [[Admission to practice law|passed the bar exam]] and are not attorneys.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt; The summer associate program is often the primary method by which a law firm recruits for full-time associate positions.

==Compensation==
According to published data from the New York Times, the annual base salary for partner-track first year associate attorneys at top law firms in major U.S. legal markets such as [[New York (state)|New York]], [[California]], [[Massachusetts]], the [[District of Columbia]], and [[Texas]] can range from $160,000 to $180,000 per year—with salary varying depending on the size and reputation of the firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/07/business/dealbook/law-firm-salaries-jump-for-the-first-time-in-nearly-a-decade.html?_r=0 |title = Law Firm Salaries Jump for the First Time in Nearly a Decade |first = Elizabeth |last= Olson |date = June 6, 2016 |work = [[The New York Times]] | access-date = January 4, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3737">'''Career development''' is the lifelong process of managing learning, work, leisure, and transitions in order to move toward a personally determined and evolving preferred future.

In educational development, [[career]] development provides a person, often a student, focus for selecting a career or subject(s) to undertake in the future. Often educational institutions provide career counsellors to assist students with their educational development.

In [[organizational development]] (or OD), the study of '''career development''' looks at:
*how individuals manage their careers within and between organizations and,
*how organizations structure the career progress of their members, it can also be tied into [[succession planning]] within most of the organizations.
In today's world, more employers are looking for ways to facilitate career development and encourage their employees to drive their own careers.

In [[personal development]], career development is:
* " ...  the total constellation of psychological, sociological, educational, physical, economic, and chance factors that combine to influence the nature and significance of work in the total lifespan of any given individual."&lt;ref&gt;Career Development: A Policy Statement of the National Career Development Association Board of Directors
(Adopted March 16, 1993; revised 2003) [http://www.ncda.org/pdf/Policy.pdf PDF]  [http://lifeworkps.com/HPH/NCDA/NCDA-Policy-Statement-on-Seven-Stages-of-CD.html HTML] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616065155/http://lifeworkps.com/HPH/NCDA/NCDA-Policy-Statement-on-Seven-Stages-of-CD.html |date=June 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The evolution or development of a career – informed by (1) Experience within a specific field of interest (with career, job, or task specific skills as by-product) (2) Success at each stage of development, (3) educational attainment commensurate with each incremental stage, (4) Communications (the capacity to analytically reflect your suitability for a given job via cover letter, resume, and/or the interview process), and (5) understanding of career development as a navigable process. (Angelo J. Rivera)
* "... the lifelong psychological and behavioral processes as well as contextual influences shaping one’s career over the life span. As such, career development involves the person’s creation of a career pattern, decision-making style, integration of life roles, values expression, and life-role self concepts."&lt;ref&gt;Herr, E.L., &amp; Cramer, S. H. (1996). Career guidance and counseling through the lifespan: Systematic approaches. New York: HarperCollins) (Niles, S. G. &amp; Harris-Bowlsbey, J (2002) Career Development Interventions in the 21st Century. Columbus, OH: Merrill Prentice Hall., p7&lt;/ref&gt;

Castner was an early member of SCI.&lt;ref name=Bard /&gt;

The medal is presented in a public lecture, usually at the annual Electrochem conference, which is organised by the [[Royal Society of Chemistry]] (RSC) Electrochemistry Interest Group and the SCI Electrochemical Technology Group. When this is not possible, the medal presentation and lecture takes place at SCI's headquarters.

The medal's design was conceived by [[Humphrey Paget]] by commission of SCI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Editorial|journal=The Analyst|volume=78|issue=926|page=261|date=1953}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least until 1958, the award was called Castner Gold Medal.&lt;ref name=RSC1958&gt;{{cite journal|title=News and Notes|journal=Journal of the Royal Institute of Chemistry|date=1958|volume=82|issue=January|page=61|doi=10.1039/JI9588200001|url=http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticlePDF/1958/JI/JI9588200001|language=en|issn=0368-3958}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After stints in New York, Hong Kong and Singapore, he left to set up his own investment company before starting '''Capital Diamonds International''' in [[Singapore]]. In 1997, he transformed the diamond wholesale business and founded The Carat Club, a diamond retail operation based in Kuala Lumpur. 

The company grew to some 150 people with distribution in Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong, China, Taiwan, Macau and the Middle East. Under his leadership, The Carat Club was consistently nominated for Suria KLCC’s Best Luxury Retailer and Best Service Awards and in addition, was also the recipient of The 4th Asia Pacific International Honesty Enterprise Keris Award and the SMI-Unicity 2003 Best Product Award.  In 2010, the company moved its base to Shanghai to better serve the Chinese market, focusing on the 3 carats and larger segment.

He was one of the hosts and a judge of the [[corporate]] [[reality television]] series ''[[The Firm (Malaysian TV series)|The Firm]]'', where he played himself, acting as a corporate leader and mentor.&lt;ref&gt;Chandran, Sheela (27 June 2007).

The '''Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier''' (CSSF) is responsible for the [[financial regulation]] in [[Luxembourg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cssf.lu/|title=Home: Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (CSSF)|website=www.cssf.lu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CSSF is responsible for the supervision of credit institutions, experts in the financial sector, investment companies, pension funds, regulated securities markets and their operators, multilateral trading facilities and payment institutions. The CSSF is the competent authority for the public auditor oversight.

== History ==
The CSSF took over the duties of the former Commissariat aux Bourses and of the Institut Monétaire Luxembourgeois (IML), which on 1 June 1998, became the [[Central Bank of Luxembourg|Banque centrale du Luxembourg]] (BCL).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cssf.lu/fileadmin/files/Lois_reglements/Legislation/Lois/L_231298_cssf_upd210712.pdf|title=404: Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (CSSF)|website=www.cssf.lu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==
Beside the board the CSSF consists of:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cssf.lu/nc/fr/la-cssf/structure-et-organisation/|title=Organisation générale: Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (CSSF)|website=www.cssf.lu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Board Secretariat
* Secretariat
* Law Department
* Department of Human Resources, Administration and Finance
* Department of Information Systems
and 10 departments, including 8 are responsible for the supervision of the financial sector, a section for general supervision and control of the Department of the profession:
* General Supervision
* Supervision of UCI
* Supervision of Management Companies of UCI
* Supervision of banks
* Supervision of investment firms
* Specialised care of PFS
* Information Systems and Supervision of Support PFS
* Supervision of pension funds, and securitization SICAR organisms
* Monitoring of the securities markets
* Public Auditor Oversight
* Investor Protection

== Responsibilities ==

=== Supervision ===
The CSSF supervision of the financial sector aims at the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cssf.lu/fr/la-cssf/mission-et-competences/|title=Mission et compétences: Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (CSSF)|website=www.cssf.lu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Promotion of a considered and prudent business policy in accordance with regulatory requirements
* Protect the financial stability of the regulated entities and the financial sector as a whole
* Monitoring the quality of the organization and internal control systems
* Strengthening the quality of risk management
The CSSF monitors all financial activities in Luxembourg, which require the approval of the Minister responsible for the CSSF. It is only in the public interest, ensure that the laws and ordinances are enforced on the financial sector and respected and that international conventions and EU directives in the areas under their responsibility to be implemented. The CSSF is authorized to require all necessary information to perform their duties of companies under its supervision. The CSSFübernimmt at Community and international level negotiations on the financial sector and coordinate the implementation of government initiatives and measures about an orderly expansion of the activities of the financial sector.

=== Public auditor oversight ===
The CSSF is the public auditor oversight. In this regard, the CSSF is thus responsible for the granting of the professional qualifications of the "Independent Auditor" (auditors) and "cabinet de Revision" (audit) for the approval and registration of statutory auditors and audit firms. The CSSF is also responsible for the implementation of auditing standards and professional ethics standards and internal quality control of audit firms and approved for continuing education.

=== Investor protection ===
The CSSF is directly responsible for investor protection related queries.  As part of the FIN-NET programme, the CSSF is the sole recourse for investors who seek compensation or complaints handling.  Unlike some jurisdictions, there is no separate or independent ombudsman.  There have been a number of high-profile cases, including Madoff, where the CSSF's ability to enforce customer complaints has come into question.  To date, the general response has been unsatisfactory and there are increasing concerns over the capabilities of the CSSF to carry out their duties effectively.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2011/cr11148.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Companies House''' is the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[registrar of companies]] and is an [[executive agency]] and [[trading fund]] of [[Government of the United Kingdom|Her Majesty's Government]]. It falls under the remit of the [[Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy]] (BEIS) and is also a member of the [[Public Data Group]]. All forms of companies (as permitted by the United Kingdom [[Companies Act 2006|Companies Act]]) are incorporated and registered with Companies House and file specific details as required by the current [[Companies Act 2006]]. All registered limited companies, including subsidiary, small and inactive companies, must file annual [[financial statements]] in addition to annual company returns, which are all public records. Only some registered [[unlimited company|unlimited companies]] (meeting certain conditions) are exempt from this requirement.

The United Kingdom has had a system of company registration since 1844. The legislation governing company registration matters is the [[Companies Act 2006]].

==History==
The [[Joint Stock Companies Act 1844]] permitted the [[incorporation (business)|incorporation]] of [[joint-stock company|joint-stock companies]], previously only possible by the mechanisms of [[royal charter]] or [[local and personal Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom|private act]], which had meant few companies were formed. The act therefore required that all companies formed under it were recorded on a public register, and created the office of [[Registrar of Joint Stock Companies]] to be responsible for maintaining the register.

Company registration in Scotland commenced in 1856, with the first company registered being 'The Daily Bulletin Limited'. The first Registrar of Joint Stock Companies for Scotland was George Deane from 1856 to 1858, before he was transferred to the London office of Companies House to be Chief Clerk to the Registrar for England and Wales.

The remaining staff were transferred to the office of the [[Queen's and Lord Treasurer's Remembrancer]] (Q&amp;LTR), who took on the role of Registrar of Companies for Scotland.

In 1982 the post of Q&amp;LTR was transferred to the [[Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service#Crown Agent|Crown Agent]] and the staff and functions relating to companies registration in Scotland were transferred to the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) on 1 April 1981.

In October 1988, Companies House became an [[executive agency]] of the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]], and then in October 1991 started to operate as a [[trading fund]], self-financing by retaining income from charges.

==England and Wales==
[[England and Wales]] are treated as a single entity (companies may be ‘Registered in England and Wales’) with a unified register, separate from those of Scotland or Northern Ireland. Companies must advise Companies House of their intended [[registered office]] (the official address of the company), which may be in England and Wales, in Scotland, or in Wales.&lt;ref name="companies house"&gt;{{cite web|title=Company Formation GBF1|url=http://www.companieshouse.gov.uk/about/gbhtml/gbf1.shtml|accessdate=10 October 2008|publisher=Companies House|year=2003|work=Companies House website|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012111500/http://www.companieshouse.gov.uk/about/gbhtml/gbf1.shtml|archivedate=12 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, on incorporation, companies will be either ‘Registered in England and Wales’, ‘Registered in Scotland’, or ‘Registered in Wales’. Effectively, companies in England must register in England and Wales, companies in Scotland must register in Scotland, while companies in Wales may choose to register in either England and Wales, or in Wales.

Although actual legal registration is in either England and Wales, or in Wales, according to Companies House companies must display the company registered office location in a format similar to one of the following suggested formats:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''“On all company’s business letters, order forms (in hard copy, electronic or any other form) and its websites, the company must show in legible lettering:''

''(a) the part of the United Kingdom in which the company is registered which is:''

''For Companies registered in England and Wales either:''

*''Registered in England and Wales; or''
*''Registered in England; or''
*''Registered in Wales; or''
*''Registered in London; or''
*''Registered in Cardiff.”''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Companies House, Cardiff - geograph.org.uk - 1521422.jpg|thumb|The Cardiff office]]
The Companies House office in [[Cardiff]] handles companies incorporated in [[England and Wales]].&lt;ref name="companies house"/&gt; These companies are subject to [[English law]]. There was another office at [[Nantgarw]], Wales, however this location was closed in 2011.

The London office at Abbey Orchard Street is purely a facility to file and view documents, which are then processed in Cardiff.

The [[Registrar of Companies for England and Wales]] is the Chief Executive Louise Smyth. The role of Chief Registrar is not a political one and the incumbent is a civil servant. The previous Chief Executive was Tim Moss.

Companies House is also responsible for [[Dissolution (law)|dissolving]] companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glossary of Useful Terms|url=https://baileyahmad.co.uk/business/glossary/|website=Bailey Ahmad|accessdate=18 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scotland==
The [[Edinburgh]] office handles companies incorporated in [[Scotland]]. These companies are subject to [[Scots law]].

The [[Registrar of Companies for Scotland]] is Aoife Martin.

==Northern Ireland==
The [[Companies Act 2006]] was fully implemented on 1 October 2009 and the Northern Ireland companies register was fully integrated into Companies House.  Companies House maintains a satellite office in Belfast, headed by the Registrar of Companies for Northern Ireland.

Before 1 October 2009 all limited companies in [[Northern Ireland]] were registered with the [[Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment]] and were subject to [[Northern Ireland law]].

==Types of companies==
There are many different types of companies, including:
*[[Public limited company]] (PLC)
*[[Private company limited by shares]] (Ltd, Limited)
*[[Private company limited by guarantee]], typically a non-commercial membership body which may, or may not, be charitable (Ltd, Limited)
*Private [[unlimited company]] (either with or without a share capital)
*[[Limited liability partnership]] (LLP)
*[[Limited partnership]]  (LP)
*[[Societas Europaea]] (SE): European Union-wide company structure
*Companies incorporated by [[Royal Charter]] (RC)
*[[Community interest company]] (CIC) : Usually a standard ltd company but regardless of the companies articles it must reinvest any and all profit
*[[Charitable incorporated organisation]] (CIO): a charity with limited liability

==Register of company directors==

All companies are required to appoint one or more directors (the minimum number is dependent upon the company type) and generally it is up to the members to appoint the people they believe will run the company well on their behalf. The only restrictions that prevent anyone becoming a director are they must be at least 16 and:

*they must not have been disqualified from acting as a company director(unless the court has given them permission to act for a particular company);
*they must not be an undischarged bankrupt (unless they have been given permission by the court to act for a particular company).

In February 2008, ''The Times''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-check.com/media/d/content_pressarticle_reference/Times_CompaniesHouse_0802.pdf|title=The Times: 4,000 company directors listed as global terror suspects and fraudsters|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Computer Weekly''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerweekly.com/Articles/2008/02/21/229520/uk-companies-house-register-contains-3994-high-risk-individuals-datanomic.htm|title=UK Companies House register contains 3,994 high-risk individuals, Datanomic finds|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; broke a story that almost 4,000 of the names on the Companies House register of directors were on international watchlists of alleged fraudsters, money launderers, terror financiers and corrupt officials. The results came from [[Datanomic]] who had screened the 6.8 million names on the register against a World-Check database of high risk  individuals and businesses. The exercise also revealed more than 1,500 disqualified company directors were being allowed to run other UK companies as Companies House was not checking names against its register of disqualified persons.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1988">'''Court auction''' is an auction which takes place at a public location designated by the court.

If a property owner fails to pay the mortgage, the mortgage holder can [[Foreclosure|foreclose]] on that property. If the owner is unable to make sufficient payments, the property can be sold at auction. The time and place of the auction is published in official records.

In case the value of the debt being foreclosed on is substantially less than the market value of the real property, this can finish the trouble for the debitor by paying all the credits.

== Germany ==

In [[Germany]] the court may suspend the auction for 6 months on the debtor's justified request. Justification may be hardship, e.g. if debtor has a physical disability and cannot find adequate housing. The creditor can object up to twice if the result of the auction is not sufficient to fulfil the claim. The bidder must deposit security in the amount of 10%. The highest bidder becomes the owner of the real property. If the claim is greater than the market value of the real property, debts are handled in an [[insolvency]] proceeding.

== Spain ==

Spanish mortgage holders are responsible for the full amount of the loan to the bank in addition to penalty interest charges, and court fees.

== United States ==

Historically, the vast majority of judicial foreclosures have been unopposed, since most defaulting borrowers have no money with which to hire counsel. The highest bidder at the auction becomes the owner of the real property, free and clear of interest of the former owner. In 2009 there was a growing consensus that the deepening collapse of the housing market was at the heart of the country’s acute economic downturn. The rules for court auction differ in the states.

'''Decentralized decision-making''' is any process where the decision-making authority is distributed throughout a larger group. It also connotes a higher authority given to lower level functionaries, executives, and workers. This can be in any organization of any size, from a governmental authority to a [[corporation]]. However, the context in which the term is used is generally that of larger organizations. This distribution of power, in effect, has far-reaching implications for the fields of management, organizational behavior, and government.

The decisions arising from a process of decentralized decision-making are the functional result of [[group intelligence]] and [[crowd wisdom]]. Decentralized decision-making also contributes to the [[core knowledge]] of [[group intelligence]] and [[crowd wisdom]], often in a [[subconscious]] way a la [[Carl Jung]]'s [[collective unconscious]].

[[Decision theory]] is a method of [[deductive reasoning]] based on formal [[probability]] and [[deductive reasoning]] models. It is also studied in a specialized field of mathematics wherein models are used to help make decisions in all human activities including the sciences and engineering. (See also [[Game theory]], [[Uncertainty]], [[Expectation maximization principle]].)

== History ==

Decentralization and centralization have been consistent themes throughout history pertaining to governmental authority and political theory. From the rise and fall of the Roman Empire, there have been periods of centralization and decentralization in societies worldwide. Almost any political movement, from the rise of [[city states]] in [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] times, to the later rise and downfall of [[feudal]] empires during the [[middle ages]], to the rise of [[fascism]] in Germany prior to [[World War II]], to the late 20th century formation of the [[European Economic Union]], the history of Europe has been one of cycles of centralization and decentralization.

[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] Professor [[Thomas W. Malone]] explains that "decentralization has three general benefits:

# encourages motivation and creativity
# allows many minds to work simultaneously on the same problem
# accommodates flexibility and individualization

Decentralized decision-making, Malone says, tends to create less rigidity and flatter hierarchies in organizations. When upper management delegates decision-making responsibilities, there also exist wider spans of control among managers, creating a more lateral flow of information. Thus there will be more bottom up directional information flow, allowing for more innovation and efficiency closer to the means of production. This increased flow information thereby allows for innovation in what is called [[Total quality management]].

'''Emilio Gnutti''' is an [[Italy|Italian]] [[financier]] and founder of the [[Hopa (company)|Hopa SpA]] [[holding company]]. He was involved in many important [[takeover]]s, most notably the one of [[Telecom Italia]] made  in 1999 with [[Roberto Colaninno]], and the subsequent sale of the company to [[Marco Tronchetti Provera]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/01_33/b3745082.htm "Tronchetti's Telecom Italia Coup"], ''[[BusinessWeek]]'', August 31, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; On October 25, 2006 he was sentenced to six months in jail for [[insider trading]] in the [[Unipol]] (''[[bancopoli]]'') case, together with [[Giovanni Consorte]] and [[Ivano Sacchetti]]. He appealed, but then he decided to accept a [[plea bargain]] and on November 12, 2007 the [[Milan]] [[Court of Appeal]] converted the sentence into a [[fine (penalty)|fine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} [http://www.corriere.it/economia/07_novembre_12/Unipol_consorte.shtml "Unipol, condanna confermata a Consorte"], ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'', November 13, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Accounting}}
In [[accountancy|accounting]], '''equity''' (or '''owner's equity''') is the difference between the value of the [[asset|assets]] and the value of the [[liability (financial accounting)|liabilities]] of something owned. It is governed by the following equation:
:&lt;math&gt; \text{equity} = \text{assets} - \text{liabilities} &lt;/math&gt;
For example, if someone owns a car worth $15,000 (an asset), but owes $5,000 on a loan against that car (a liability), the car represents $10,000 of equity. Equity can be [[negative equity|negative]] if liabilities exceed assets. '''Shareholders' equity''' (or stockholders' equity, shareholders' funds, shareholders' capital or similar terms) represents the equity of a company as divided among [[shareholder]]s of [[common stock|common]] or [[preferred stock]]. Negative shareholders' equity is often referred to as a shareholders' deficit.

Alternatively, equity can also refer to a [[corporation]]'s [[share capital]] (''capital stock'' in American English). The value of the share capital depends on the corporation's future economic prospects. For a company in [[liquidation]] proceedings, the equity is that which remains after all liabilities have been paid.

==Owner's equity==

When starting a [[business]], the [[owner]]s fund the business to finance various [[business operations|operations]]. Under the model of a [[private limited company]], the business and its owners are separate entities, so the business is considered to owe these funds to its owners as a liability in the form of [[share capital]]. Throughout the business's existence, the equity of the business will be the difference between its assets and debt liabilities; this is the [[accounting equation]].

When a business [[liquidation|liquidates]] during [[bankruptcy]], the proceeds from the assets are used to reimburse creditors. The creditors are ranked by priority, with secured [[creditor]]s being paid first, other creditors being paid next, and owners being paid last. Owner's equity (also known as risk capital or liable capital) is this remaining or [[residual claimant|residual claim]] against assets, which is paid only after all other creditors are paid. In such cases where even creditors could not get enough money to pay their bills, the owner's equity is reduced to zero because nothing is left to reimburse it.

==Accounting==
In [[financial accounting]], owner's equity consists of the [[net assets]] of an entity. Net assets is the difference between the total [[asset]]s and total [[liability (financial accounting)|liabilities]].&lt;ref&gt;IFRS Framework quotation: [[International Accounting Standards Board]] F.49(c)&lt;/ref&gt; Equity appears on the [[balance sheet]] (also known as the [[Statement of Financial Position|statement of financial position]]), one of the four primary [[financial statement]]s.

The assets of an entity can be both tangible and intangible items. Intangible assets include items such as brand names, copyrights or goodwill. Tangible assets include land, equipment, and cash. The types of accounts and their description that comprise the owner's equity depend on the nature of the entity and may include:
*[[Share capital]] ([[common stock]])
*[[Preferred stock]]
*[[Capital surplus]]
*[[Retained earnings]]
*[[Treasury stock]]
*[[Stock options]]
*[[Reserve (accounting)|Reserve]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://finance.yahoo.com/q/bs?s=C&amp;annual Example of Balance Sheet]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Book value===
The [[book value]] of equity will change in the case of the following events:
* Changes in assets relative to liabilities. For example, a profitable firm receives more cash for its products than the cost at which it produced these goods, and so in the act of making a profit, increases its retained earnings, therefore its shareholders' equity.
* Issue of new equity in which the firm obtains new capital increases the total shareholders' equity.
*[[Share repurchase]]s, in which a firm returns money to investors, reducing on the asset side its financial assets, and on the liability side the shareholders' equity. For practical purposes (except for its tax consequences), share repurchasing is similar to a dividend payment. Rather than giving money to all shareholders immediately in the form of a dividend payment, a share repurchase reduces the number of shares outstanding.
* Dividends paid out to [[preferred stock]] owners are considered an expense to be subtracted from [[net income]] {{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}(from the point of view of the common share owners).
* Other reasons - Assets and liabilities can change without any effect being measured in the Income Statement under certain circumstances; for example, changes in accounting rules may be applied retroactively.  Sometimes assets bought and held in other countries get translated back into the reporting currency at different exchange rates, resulting in a changed value.

===Shareholders' equity===
When the owners are [[shareholder]]s, the interest can be called shareholders' equity; the [[accounting]] remains the same, and it is ownership equity spread out among shareholders. If all shareholders are in one and the same class, they share equally in ownership equity from all perspectives. However, shareholders may allow different priority ranking among themselves by the use of share classes and options. This complicates analysis for both [[stock valuation]] and accounting.

Shareholders' equity is obtained by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of the shareholders.&lt;ref name="StolowyLebas2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Hervé Stolowy|author2=Michel Lebas|title=Financial Accounting and Reporting: A Global Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rRGF7iSaxc8C&amp;pg=PA139|date=January 2006|publisher=Cengage Learning EMEA|isbn=1-84480-250-7|pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; These assets and liabilities can be:

*Equity (beginning of year)
*+ net income
*− dividends
*+/− gain/loss from changes to the number of [[shares outstanding]].
*= Equity (end of year) if one gets more money during the year or less or not anything

==Equity stock==

===Equity investments===
{{main|Stock trader}}
An equity investment generally refers to the buying and holding of shares of [[stock]] on a [[stock market]] by individuals and firms in anticipation of income from [[dividend]]s and [[capital gain]]s. Typically, equity holders receive voting rights, meaning that they can vote on candidates for the board of directors (shown on a [[Proxy (statistics)|diversification]] of the fund(s) and to obtain the skill of the professional [[Investment management|fund managers]] in charge of the fund(s)). An alternative, which is usually employed by large private investors and pension funds, is to hold shares directly; in the institutional environment many clients who own [[Portfolio (finance)|portfolio]]s have what are called [[segregated fund]]s, as opposed to or in addition to the pooled mutual fund alternatives.

A calculation can be made to assess whether an equity is over or underpriced, compared with a long-term government bond. This is called the [[yield gap]] or Yield Ratio. It is the ratio of the [[dividend]] yield of an equity and that of the long-term bond.

=== Market value of equity stock ===
In the [[stock market]], market price per share does not correspond to the equity per share calculated in the accounting statements. Equity stock valuations, which are often much higher, are based on other considerations related to the business' [[operating cash flow]], profits and future prospects; some factors are derived from the accounting statement. While accounting equity can potentially be negative, market price per share is never negative since equity shares represent ownership in limited liability companies. The principle of limited liability guarantees that a shareholder's losses may never exceed his investment.

===Merton model===
Under the "Merton model",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Merton|first1=Robert C.|title=On the Pricing of Corporate Debt: The Risk Structure of Interest Rates.|journal=Journal of Finance|date=1974|volume=29|issue=2|pages=449–470|doi=10.1111/j.1540-6261.1974.tb03058.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; the value of stock equity is modeled as a [[call option]] on the [[enterprise value|value of the whole company]] (including the liabilities), [[Strike price|struck]] at the nominal value of the liabilities. Here, the equity market value depends on the volatility of the market value of the company assets.

This is the first example of a "structural model", where bankruptcy is modeled using a microeconomic model of the firm's [[capital structure]] - it treats [[bankruptcy]] as a continuous [[probability of default]], where, on the random occurrence of [[debt default|default]], the stock price of the defaulting company is assumed to go to zero. &lt;ref&gt;Robert Merton, “Option Pricing When Underlying Stock Returns are Discontinuous” ''Journal of Financial Economics'', 3, January–March, 1976, pp. 125–44.&lt;/ref&gt;  
This microeconomic approach, to some extent, allows us to answer the question "what are the economic causes of default?". &lt;ref name="Brigo"&gt;[https://cdn.uclouvain.be/public/Exports%20reddot/csam/documents/Damiano_Brigo_Nonlinear_Valuation_and_XVA_under_Credit_Risk_Collateral_Margins_and_Funding_Costs.pdf Nonlinear valuation and XVA under credit risk, collateral margins and Funding Costs]. Prof. Damiano Brigo, Univ. Catholique de Louvain&lt;/ref&gt; 
(Structural models are distinct from "reduced form models" - such as [[Jarrow–Turnbull model|Jarrow–Turnbull]] - where bankruptcy is modeled as a statistical process.)

== Equity in real estate ==
The notion of equity as it relates to real estate derives from the concept called [[equity of redemption]]. This equity is a property right valued at the difference between the market value of the property and the amount of any mortgage or other encumbrance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8232">'''False self-employment''' is a situation in which somebody registered as [[self-employed]], a [[freelancer]], or a [[Temporary work|temp]] is de facto an [[employee]] carrying out a professional activity under the authority and subordination of another company.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Beyens and Valery Vermeulen, [http://www.droitbelge.be/fiches_detail.asp?idcat=25&amp;id=211 Le faux indépendant], DroitBelge.net, accessed 15 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Such false self-employment is often a way to circumvent social welfare and employment legislation, for example by avoiding employer's social security and income tax contributions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hudsoncontract.co.uk/news-resources/2016/jan/what-is-false-self-employment/&lt;/ref&gt; While a modern "gig economy" encourages more casual employment practices in the interests of labour flexibility, the extent to which this disguises precarious employment and denial of rights is of growing concern to authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Booth, [https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/20/hmrc-launch-crackdown-gig-economy-firms-agency-self-employed-staff Ministers order HMRC crackdown on ‘gig economy’ firms], ''[[The Guardian]]'', Oct. 20, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vanessa Houlder and Sarah O’Connor, [https://www.ft.com/content/9228e40a-976d-11e6-a80e-bcd69f323a8b Revenue cracks down on ‘false self-employment’], ''[[Financial Times]]'', Oct. 21, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a grey area of self-employed persons who rely heavily on a single customer while legitimately being independent.&lt;ref&gt;U. Muehlberger, ''Dependent Self-Employment: Workers on the Border between Employment and Self-Employment'' (Palgrave, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Principle ==
A salaried-work relation hidden behind a false pretense of self-employment is in some jurisdictions a violation of and a non‑compliance with labour law.

For social security, the falsely self-employed is declared not to be subject to employment law, but actually works under an employer’s authority in a [[:fr:Lien de subordination en droit du travail français|subordinate relationship]], with the same conditions as his salaried colleagues but without any [[employment contract]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.droitbelge.be/fiches_detail.asp?idcat=25&amp;id=211 Pierre Beyens, avocat au barreau de Bruxelles auprès de van Cutsem Wittamer Marnef &amp; Partners]&lt;/ref&gt;

When a salaried-work relation is hidden under such a false pretense, there is a violation of law and both parties expose themselves to sanctions.

The constitutive elements of an employment contract typically are:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.droitbelge.be/fiches_detail.asp?idcat=25&amp;id=211 Pierre Beyens, avocat au barreau de Bruxelles auprès de van Cutsem Wittamer Marnef &amp; Partners]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Work performed;
* for [[remuneration]];
* in a subordinate relationship.

== In Belgium ==
The (Belgian) legislator considers the following elements to define a subordinate relationship:
# No worker’s participation in the company’s profits or losses;
# No proper capital investments in the company;
# No responsibility or decision‑taking power in the company;
# The certainty of getting a regular payment;
# The fact of having just a single and unique customer company;
# The fact of having no personal workers/the fact of not being an employer;
# The fact of not being able to organise one’s working period;
# The existence of in-house control procedures, with related sanctions;
# No decision‑taking power concerning customers’ invoicing.
[[Labour law]] tends in a jurisprudential way to view self-employment as false when many of the above elements are present.

The ministers’ council (the Belgian Cabinet) on 5 May 2006 examined a legislative proposal (a bill) which no longer refers to a “faux indépedant” (read: falsely self-employed person), but to "qualification adequate de la nature des relations de travail" ("appropriate qualification about the nature of relationships at work"), whether salaried or independent. The bill came from the minister of small business, [[Sabine Laruelle]] (MR political party – liberal), and the minister of social affairs, [[Rudy Demotte]] (PS political party – socialist). The governmental declaration of July 2004 already planned such a bill.

The legislative proposal confirms the general principles stated by the jurisprudence and the [[Court of Cassation (Belgium)|Court of Cassation]]: to have an employment contract, there must be a relationship of authority and subordination; (and) to have a contract between independent actors, there must be no such relationship. This reflects the party’s intention as expressed in their programme. Elements such as freedom to organise one’s working time/period, freedom to organise one's work and the possibility to have a hierarchical control allow to evaluate the existence or not of any hierarchical relationship.

Moreover, this establishes legal certainty: the current system of freedom of contract between parties is confirmed, the potential problems are framed either in specific sectors, or in individual situations.

==In Britain==
===Construction industry===
A British trade union [[UCATT]] which specialized in the construction industry has expressed concern that false self-employment was being used by many British employers to evade taxes and engage workers without having to respect employment rights and entitlements such as holiday pay, sick pay and pensions. In their opinion, whilst the practice was immoral, it was not, in their view, necessarily illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ucatt.org.uk/false-self-employment|title=False Self Employment|publisher=UCATT/Unite union UK|accessdate =2017-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The UK taxation arrangement known as the  Construction Industry Scheme (CIS)  allowed registered companies to deduct tax at source and thus avoid employing workers directly as their regular or casual employee who would thus have acquired legal employee rights.

Instead casual staff could be assumed to be sub-contractors who were falsely supposed to be self-employed, and thus responsible for paying their own tax and social security contributions.

If such persons were not registered as self-employed, they would thereby be liable for unlawfully evading their legal obligations.

===Offshore Oil===
The British Government’s [[HM Revenue and Customs]] service found in 2013  evidence that some companies and employment businesses connected with the [[North Sea oil|offshore oil industry]] were using [[Employment Agencies Act 1973|employment intermediaries]] to disguise the employment of their workers as self-employment, primarily to avoid paying employers [[National Insurance]] contributions  and to reduce the costs associated with [[Employment Rights Act 1996|workers’ employment rights]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/onshore-employment-intermediaries-false-self-employment HM Revenue and Customs:Onshore employment intermediaries: false self-employment]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spain==
The Spanish Ministry of Employment is trying (as of mid August 2017) to address commercial accounting agencies who invoice employers on behalf of regular employees falsely presented self-employed persons to evade or minimise their tax and social security obligations (Self employed people are known as autónomos in Spanish, and usually raise their own invoices for irregular work assignments themselves). Fidelis Factu Sociedad Cooperativa, better known as Factoo, has been obliged to close its operation following a sanction imposed by the Ministry. There are known to be several other cooperatives of this type, although Factoo is the largest so far identified and the first to be shut down.&lt;ref&gt;[https://economia.elpais.com/economia/2017/08/17/actualidad/1502980859_019100.html#?ref=rss&amp;format=simple&amp;link=link El País Spanish newspaper:Empleo pone coto a las falsas cooperativas de autónomos y obliga a cerrar Factoo]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7800">'''The Franchise Rule''' defines acts or practices that are unfair or deceptive in the franchise industry in the [[United States]]. The Franchise Rule is published by the [[Federal Trade Commission]].
The Franchise Rule seeks to facilitate informed decisions and to prevent deception in the sale of franchises by requiring franchisors to provide prospective franchisees with essential information prior to the sale. It does not, however, regulate the substance of the terms that control the relationship between franchisors and franchisees.
Also, while The Franchise Rule removed the regulation of the sale of franchises from the purview of the states under the authority of the FTC to regulate interstate commerce,  The FTC Franchise Rule does not require franchisors to disclose the unit performance statistics of the franchised system to new buyers of franchises as would be necessary and material under state and federal Securities and Exchange law.

==Franchise Law==
In the United States, the [[Federal Trade Commission]] has oversight of [[franchising]], rather than the US [[Securities and Exchange Commission]]. 
The FTC administrates oversight via the FTC Franchise Rule.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ftc.gov/os/fedreg/2007/march/070330franchiserulefrnotice.pdf#page=102&lt;/ref&gt; 
The FTC announced an update to the franchise Rule on January 23, 2007, becoming effective July 1, 2007.&lt;ref name="ftc.gov"&gt;http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2007/01/franchiserule.shtm&lt;/ref&gt;

The most recent version of the FTC ''Franchise Rule'' was in 2007, is printed in {{harvnb|FR|2007a|pp=15544–15575}}.

After July 2008, all franchisors in the United States are to use the [[Franchise Disclosure Document]] with potential franchisees.

==Franchise Law background==
The Federal Trade Commission began examining practices in franchising in 1970. In 1971 the FTC began a formal rule making proceeding, to possibly develop a regulation requiring disclosure and prohibiting unfair practices in offering and selling franchises. These developments resulted in promulgation of the FTC Franchise Rule in 1979. The FTC enforces the [[Federal Trade Commission Act]] ("FTC Act"), which prohibits unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.

The FTC Act also empowers the Commission to prescribe rules that define with specificity acts or practices that are unfair or deceptive. One such rule is the Commission's Franchise Rule.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2002"&gt;http://www.ftc.gov/os/2002/06/020625bealesfranruletest.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commission focuses much of its Franchise Rule enforcement and consumer educational resources on combating business opportunity fraud.

The Franchise Rule requires franchisors to make material disclosures in five categories: 
*(1)	the nature of the franchisor and the franchise system;
*(2)	the franchisor's financial viability;
*(3)	the costs involved in purchasing and operating a franchised outlet;
*(4)	the terms and conditions that govern the franchise relationship; and
*(5)	the names and addresses of current franchisees who can share their experiences within the franchise system, thus helping the prospective franchisee to verify independently the franchisor's claims.

In addition, franchisors must have a reasonable basis and substantiation for any earnings claims made to prospective franchisees, as well as disclose the basis and assumptions underlying any such earnings claims.  Earnings Claims are not required to be provided to prospective franchisees  under the FTC Rule and the majority of franchisors do not make earnings claims and do not disclose the unit performance statics of their franchisees to prospective franchisees.

The Franchise Rule generally covers two different types of business arrangements: franchises and business opportunity ventures.

==Franchise Agreements==
Franchise agreements typically involve retail outlets that bear the franchisor's trademark and follow the franchisor's business operations model, such as fast-food restaurants, hotels, and automotive repair shops. These are commonly known as "business-format" franchises.

==Franchise business opportunities rip offs==
Franchise business opportunities rip offs often do not entail a trademark or detailed business plan. 
The franchise business opportunity typically promises to provide the buyer with equipment that is used to sell products or services to the public, such as vending machines, rack displays, pay phones, or medical billing software, and frequently promises to find the buyer a market for the products or services.
Many business opportunities are outright scams that disappear shortly after taking consumers' money. Compliance with The Franchise Rule by business opportunity sellers is low.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2002"/&gt;

==UFOC Franchise Disclosure Laws==
In addition to the FTC, fifteen states require pre-sale disclosure in franchise sales in the form of a [[Uniform Franchise Offering Circular]] ("UFOC").  
Because a UFOC is accepted by both the states and the FTC, the UFOC Guidelines have effectively become the national franchise disclosure standard.

==Franchise Rule Enforcement==
The Franchise Rule has the force and effect of law, and it may be enforced through civil penalty actions in federal courts.(10) The FTC Act authorizes courts to impose civil penalties of not more than $11,000 per compliance violation.

==Franchise Disclosure Document==
The Franchise Rule requires franchisors to provide all potential franchisees with a disclosure document containing 23 specific items of information about the offered franchise, its officers, and other franchisees.

Required Franchise Disclosure Document topics include: the franchise’s litigation history, past and current franchisees and their contact information, any exclusive territory that comes with the franchise, assistance the franchisor provides franchisees, and the cost of purchasing and starting up a franchise. If a franchisor makes representations about the financial performance of the franchise, this topic also must be covered, as well as the material basis backing up those representations."

==Franchise termination==
Franchise termination is covered in the franchise agreement between the franchiser and franchisee. In the 2007 Franchise Rule, comments from former franchisees were listed concerning confidentiality agreements and [[Franchise fraud]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3287">'''Frederick Orton Hamilton''' (27 December 1873 &amp;ndash; 25 July 1945) was a [[Nelson, New Zealand]] wool, grain, and produce and general merchant who led the development of his region's horticulture.

==Family==
He was born in [[Greymouth]], [[West Coast Region|West Coast]], New Zealand on 27 December 1873 second son, by his first wife Sarah Jane Orton, of the fourteen children of Francis Hamilton, then a hardware merchant and later a [[mayor of Grey]]mouth.&lt;ref name="DNZB Hamilton"&gt;{{DNZB|last=Kuchciak|first=Natalie|id=4h11|title=Frederick Orton Hamilton|accessdate=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frederick married Isabelle Porter, second daughter of Colonel T W Porter and Herewaka Porourani Potae who was to inherit the high rank of [[Ariki]] Tapirau in [[Te Whanau-a-Apanui]].  Frederick and Isabelle were leading personalities in Nelson. She died in 1936, he died in 1945. They were survived by four daughters and two sons.&lt;ref name="DNZB Hamilton"/&gt;

==E Buxton &amp; Co==
Francis Hamilton bought E Buxton &amp; Co, general merchants in 1881 and greatly expanded the business so that it handled a large wholesale and retail trade in agricultural, mining, building and household equipment and groceries. As a stock and station agency it handled wool hops and barley, purchased directly from farmers. The barley was malted and supplied to local breweries.&lt;ref&gt;page 98, ''The Cyclopedia of New Zealand (Nelson District)'', The Cyclopedia Company Limited, Christchurch 1906&lt;/ref&gt;

After the business was restructured in 1936 it was renamed Buxton's. In 1963 it was sold to [[Wright Stephenson|Wright Stephenson &amp; Co]].

Frederick Hamilton entered the firm ten years after his father had purchased it. After three years he went to work for the hardware business of Briscoe, MacNeil &amp; Co as a representative covering the East Coast of the North Island. Appointed a director of Buxton's when his father died in 1901 Frederick developed broader interests for the firm now run with his brothers.&lt;ref name="DNZB Hamilton"/&gt;

==Horticulture==
===Apples===
When apples began to be grown for export Frederick offered growers financial help. He also successfully lobbied the government to offer apple exporters a guaranteed price and help with marketing arrangements in London.&lt;ref name="DNZB Hamilton"/&gt;

===Hops===
A district hop growers association was founded in 1918. Hamilton offered them his full co-operation and his enthusiasm and encouragement in the development of hop marketing led to his being appointed their managing agent.&lt;ref name="DNZB Hamilton"/&gt;

===Tobacco===
[[Johann Gerhard Husheer|Gerhard Husheer]] of the New Zealand Tobacco Company was persuaded by Hamilton to choose Nelson for tobacco-growing following a visit to the district in 1914. Again Hamilton offered supervision of the culture of the crop and offered growers financial help.&lt;ref name="DNZB Hamilton"/&gt;

'''Golden Triangle of Jakarta''' ({{lang-id|Segitiga Emas Jakarta}}) is roughly a triangular shape area of [[Jakarta]], [[Indonesia]], which extends from [[Central Jakarta]] to [[South Jakarta]]. Most of the business, financial, and diplomatic establishments are located in the area, which also forms the center of the city.

During the period between 1960-1965 Jakarta's urban development changed drastically when President [[Sukarno]], also an architect and an urban planner, personally drove the city into a modern capital that would not only be the pride of the Indonesian nation, but would also be a "beacon" of a powerful new nation.{{sfn|Silver|2007|p=101}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2015/06/22/sukarno-s-vision-a-modern-capital.html Sukarno's vision of a modern capital] www.thejakartapost.com&lt;/ref&gt; Development axis of Jakarta was shifted towards south direction starting from [[Medan Merdeka]] to [[Kebayoran Baru|Kebayoran]] as the center of Jakarta in the 1950s, replacing that of [[Medan Merdeka]]-[[Senen]]-[[Salemba]]-[[Jatinegara]] axis which has grown since the 18th century.

Some of the notable infrastructure projects of Sukarno during the first half of the 1960s were, construction of wide avenues like [[Jalan M.H. Thamrin]],  [[Jalan Jenderal Sudirman]], [[Jalan Jenderal Gatot Subroto|Jalan Gatot Subroto]] and  Semanggi "clover-leaf" highway interchange. [[Jalan H.R. Rasuna Said]] was being developed in 1970's, which after completion along with Sudirman, and Gatot Subroto roads formed the "golden triangle" of Jakarta. During the period, the earliest signs of building appeared in [[Jalan Jenderal Sudirman|Sudirman Road]] north of [[Semanggi Interchange]].{{sfn|Merrillees|2015|p=27}}

'''Guillermo Alberto Santiago Lasso Mendoza''' (born 16 November 1955) is an [[Ecuador]]ian businessman and politician. In the [[Ecuadorian general election, 2013]] he was presidential candidate for the party [[Creating Opportunities]].&lt;ref name=creo&gt;[http://www.ecuadortimes.net/2012/11/14/creo-enrolled-lasso-solines-binomial/ CREO enrolled Lasso-Solines binomial]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"In that case the opposition should unite around a single candidate who, according to ARCOP, would be Guillermo Lasso, with 26% of voter preference in the same survey." [http://www.ecuadortimes.net/2013/02/04/correas-reelection-is-uncertain/ Correa’s reelection is uncertain]&lt;/ref&gt; He landed in second place with 22.68% of valid votes but as incumbent President [[Rafael Correa]] received more than double that amount, namely 57.17%. Lasso is, through a trust named with his initials, GLM, the largest share holder in Banco de Guayaquil, where he has been executive president for more than 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Weisbrot: [http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/international/325442-media-cant-ignore-financial-scandal-in-ecuadors-presidential Media can't ignore financial scandal in Ecuador's presidential election], TheHill, 24. March 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2017, Lasso launched his second presidential campaign to succeed incumbent President Correa for the conservative [[Creating Opportunities]] party in the [[Ecuadorian general election, 2017|2017 presidential elections]], as Correa had already served his two-term constitutionally defined limit. His campaign's theme was one of "change" and he pledged to create one million more jobs in Ecuador.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecuadorinmediato.com/index.php?module=Noticias&amp;func=news_user_view&amp;id=2818813638&amp;umt=guillermo_lasso_inicia_su_campaf1a_electoral_visitando_puerta_a_puerta_a_ciudadanos_en_guayaquil Guillermo Lasso inicia su campaña electoral visitando puerta a puerta a ciudadanos en Guayaquil], ecuadorinmediato.com, 2017-01-03 (Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt; Lasso received 48.84% and lost to  [[Lenín Moreno]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Ecuadors-Right-Wing-Opposition-Doesnt-Show-Up-to-Public-Recount-it-Demanded-20170418-0015.html Lenin Again Wins Ecuador's Presidential Race After Recount], teleSUR English, 18 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2017, Lasso said in an interview with a British newspaper that in case of his victory in the presidential election he would “cordially ask” [[Julian Assange]], the [[WikiLeaks]] founder, to leave the Ecuadorian Embassy in London within 30 days.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/09/ecuador-julian-assange-embassy-notice-eviction Ecuador presidential hopeful promises to evict Julian Assange from embassy], The Guardian, 9. February 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

According to information from the Inspectorate of Banks of [[Panamá]], revealed by the Argentine newspaper [[Página 12]], Guillermo Lasso is associated with forty-nine offshore companies located in tax havens. His fortune would have jumped from $1 million to $31 million between 1999 and 2002, after his brief passage to the government.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pagina12.com.ar/25889-lasso-el-magnate-de-las-offshore&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Health Reimbursement Account''' is a notional derivative of a '''Health Reimbursement Arrangement''' ('''HRA'''),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p969.pdf IRS Publication 969]&lt;/ref&gt; a type of US employer-funded health benefit plan that reimburses employees for out-of-pocket medical expenses. Following implementation of the [[Affordable Care Act]], the health plans must be integrated with a qualified employer-sponsored group health insurance plan to avoid excise tax penalties.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-13-54.pdf IRS Notice 2013-54]&lt;/ref&gt; Using a Health Reimbursement Arrangement yields "tax advantages to offset health care costs" for both employees and employers.&lt;ref name=IRS969&gt;Internal Revenue Service. [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p969.pdf.] 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Establishment==
Health Reimbursement Accounts are funded solely by the employer; they cannot be funded through employee salary deductions. The employer sets the parameters for the Health Reimbursement Accounts, and unused dollars remain with the employer: they do not follow the employee to new employment.

==Contributions==
Health Reimbursement Accounts are notional accounts; no funds are expensed until reimbursements are paid. By health reimbursement arrangements, employers reimburse employees directly only after the employees incur approved medical expenses. According to the IRS, an HRA "must be funded solely by an employer. Contributions cannot be paid through a salary reduction agreement (such as a [[cafeteria plan]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p969/index.html|title=Publication 969 - Main Content |publisher=IRS|accessdate=22 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no minimum or maximum contribution limit on the employer's contributions to an HRA.&lt;ref name=IRS969/&gt;

==Distributions==
According to the IRS, employees are reimbursed tax-free for qualified medical expenses up to a maximum amount for a coverage period. HRAs reimburse only items (co-pays, coinsurance, deductibles, and services) agreed to by the employer that are not covered by the employer's selected standard insurance plan (any health insurance plan, not only a [[High Deductible Health Plan]]). The arrangements are described in IRC Section 105.

With an HRA, employers fund individual reimbursement accounts for their employees and define what those funds can be used for, specified out-of-pocket expenses such as deductibles and co-pays.

Qualified claims must be described in the HRA plan document at inception: before reimbursing employees for the medical expenses. Arrangements (medical services, dental services, co-pays, coinsurance, deductibles, participation) may vary from plan to plan, and an employer may have multiple plans in place, allowing much flexibility. The kinds of expenses that can be paid under an HRA are generally the same as the expenses that can be paid through a Flexible Spending Account (FSA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pfeifer|first=William|title=How to Deduct Medical Bills as Business Expenses at your Law Firm|url=http://law.about.com/od/financialmanagement/a/How-To-Deduct-Medical-Bills-As-Business-Expenses-At-Your-Law-Firm.htm|work=About.com Law Practice Management|publisher=About.com|accessdate=23 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The employer is not required to prepay into a fund for reimbursements. Instead, the employer reimburses employee claims as they occur.

Reimbursements under an HRA can be made to the following persons:
# Current and former employees.
# Spouses and dependents of those employees.
# Any person the employee could have claimed as a dependent on the employee's return unless:
## The person filed a joint return,
## The person had gross income of $3,400 or more, or
## The employee or spouse, if filing jointly, could be claimed as a dependent on someone else's tax return.
# Spouses and dependents of deceased employees.

==Advantages==

Advantages of HRAs for employers include:
* Reimbursements of qualified claims are tax-deductible for the employer.
* Employers know their maximum expense related to their health care benefit.

Advantages of HRAs for employees include:
* Contributions that employers make can be excluded from employees' gross income (contributions must be made by the employer, not come from payroll reductions).
* Reimbursements may be tax free if the employee pays qualified medical expenses.
* Unused funds in the HRA can be rolled into future years for reimbursement.
* HRAs may be offered in conjunction with other employer-provided health benefits, including [[Flexible spending account|Flexible Spending Accounts]] (FSAs).
* Employees can be reimbursed for a health care plan that meets their or their families' specific needs, as opposed to a standard company plan.

==Disadvantages==
A frequent complaint regarding HRA arrangements is that they are extremely opaque in regards to their requirements. HRAs must follow "a variety of statutory rules and provisions" including the [[Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985|COBRA]] continuation coverage requirements, [[ERISA]], and [[HIPAA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Health Reimbursement Arrangements|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-02-45.pdf|publisher=IRS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HRA plans are considered "Primary Payers" subject to Medicare Secondary Payer (MSP) mandatory reporting requirements. There are significant penalties for failure to comply with the MSP reporting requirements. Although the MSP reporting requirements began to apply to certain group health plans on January 1, 2009, [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services|CMS]] has delayed mandatory reporting for HRAs.&lt;ref&gt;Employee Benefits Institute of America 7/7/2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Rules pertaining to their reimbursements are perceived by member participants to be somewhat contradictory and/or even incoherent, leading some to lose contributions intended for healthcare but later (after the procedure or laboratory test) to be disallowed.

Other disadvantages of HRAs include:
* Self-employed persons are usually ineligible.
* "Highly compensated" participants may be subject to "certain limitations."

A sole proprietor can employ a spouse who actually helps the business. The employer would need to establish a W-2 to make the spouse's employment legitimate. The health care can be run through the business and save the family, on average, $3,000 each year. As small businesses look to reduce costs, especially medical, the HRA can be a great tool that has been used by all too few since the 1954 tax law.

HRAs are treated as group health plans and subject to the Medicare secondary payment (MSP). HRAs are subject to the provisions regardless of whether or not they have an end-of-year carry-over feature.

Standalone HRAs not offered in conjunction with a High Deductible Health Plan are subjected to restrictions starting in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jaeckle.com/Publications/Alerts/StandAloneHRAMayViolatetheHealthCareReformLaw&lt;/ref&gt; The law now essentially bans the existence of most such HRAs, as a health plan with maximum benefit limit.

After announcing his intention to vote against a same-sex marriage bill before the Senate, his opponent in the 2010 election, Democrat Susan Savage, denounced Farley's position at a rally on the steps of the New York State Capitol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://blog.timesunion.com/capitol/archives/33671/susan-savage-pretty-angry-in-pink/ |title=Susan Savage, pretty angry in pink |work=Times Union |date=2010-10-28 |accessdate=2016-05-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Farley defeated Savage was again re-elected with one of the largest pluralities in the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailygazette.com/news/2010/nov/03/1103_farley/ |title=Farley defeats Savage to win 18th term (with video) |work=The Daily Gazette |date=2010-11-03 |accessdate=2016-05-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the New York State Legislature enacted a law legalizing same-sex marriage, with Senator Farley again voting no, citing that most of his constituents had expressed opposition to the measure.

In 2016, Farley announced that he would not seek re-election in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/albany/2016/05/8598220/after-40-years-hugh-farley-announces-decision-leave-senate |title=After 40 years, Hugh Farley announces decision to leave Senate |work=POLITICO New York |date=2016-05-03 |accessdate=2016-05-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''George Huntington Hartford II''' (April 18, 1911 – May 19, 2008) was an American businessman, philanthropist, stage and film producer, and art collector. He was also heir to the [[The Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Company|A&amp;P]] supermarket fortune.

After his father's death in 1922, Hartford became one of the heirs to the estate left by his grandfather and namesake, [[George Huntington Hartford]].&lt;ref&gt;Marc Levinson (2011), The Great A&amp;P and the Struggle for Small Business in America, Hill and Wang. {{ISBN|978-0-8090-9543-8}}, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating from [[Harvard University]] in 1934, he only briefly worked for A&amp;P.

Hartford was once known as one of the world's richest people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1808636,00.html|title=Milestones|date= May 22, 2008|work=[[Time Magazine]]|first=Alex|last=Altman}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/05/19/AR2008051902520.html|title=Huntington Hartford lost millions on investments and forays into the arts as a patron, ultimately declaring bankruptcy while living in New York. |date=May 20, 2008|work=[[Washington Post]]|first=Adam|last=Bernstein}}&lt;/ref&gt; His final years were spent living in the Bahamas with his daughter, Juliet.&lt;ref name=times1 /&gt;

==Early life and education==
Huntington Hartford was born in [[New York City]], the son of Henrietta Guerard (Pollitzer) and [[Edward V. Hartford]] (1870–1922). He was named George Huntington Hartford II for his grandfather, [[George Huntington Hartford]]. His father and uncles, [[John Augustine Hartford]] and [[George Ludlum Hartford]], privately owned the [[Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company|A&amp;P]] Supermarket, which at one point had 16,000 stores in the U.S. and was the largest retail empire in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Marc Levinson (2011), The Great A&amp;P and the Struggle for Small Business in America. Hill and Wang. {{ISBN|978-0-8090-9543-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s A&amp;P was the world's largest grocer and, next to General Motors, it sold more goods than any other company in the world. ''Time'' magazine reported that A&amp;P had sales of $2.7 billion in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19501113,00.html|title=Time Magazine Cover showing Hartford's uncles|date=November 13, 1950|work=[[Time Magazine]]|accessdate=May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His maternal grandfather was from an Austrian Jewish family, and his maternal grandmother, who was Protestant, had deep roots in South Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=548eAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Flush%20with%20success,%20Edward%20Hartford%20married%20in%20JUNE%201991%201902%20a%20woman%20with%20social%20ambitions%20that%20exceeded%20his%20own:%20Henrietta%20Guerard%20Pollitzer%22&amp;dq=%22Flush%20with%20success,%20Edward%20Hartford%20married%20in%20JUNE%201991%201902%20a%20woman%20with%20social%20ambitions%20that%20exceeded%20his%20own:%20Henrietta%20Guerard%20Pollitzer%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=nUIQVfuUI4SqyQSru4LIBw&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwAA|title=The Connoisseur|date=May 1, 1991|publisher=National Magazine Company|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hartford's father was a successful inventor and manufacturer who perfected the automotive [[shock absorber]].  Along with his brothers, Edward was also an heir to the A&amp;P fortune and served as A&amp;P's corporate secretary as well as one of three trustees that controlled A&amp;P's stock.

After Hartford's birth, the family moved to [[Deal, New Jersey]], a wealthy community on the Atlantic shore.&lt;ref name=times1&gt;{{cite news |first=Daniel |last=Lewis |coauthors= |title= Huntington Hartford, A&amp;P Heir, Dies at 97|work=New York Times |page= |date=May 20, 2008|accessdate= |quote= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Huntington's father died when he was 11, his mother moved the family to a mansion in [[Newport, Rhode Island]] known as "Seaverge" next to [[Rough Point]], the mansion owned by tobacco heiress [[Doris Duke]].  The family also lived on a {{convert|1000|acre|km2|adj=on}} plantation in [[South Carolina]] called "Wando" as well as an apartment on Fifth Avenue in [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref name="Astor"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mrsastor.com/2008_05_01_archive.htm |title=Mrs. Astor and the Gilded Age |publisher= |date=May 23, 2008 |accessdate=December 26, 2011 }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his father died in 1922, Hartford's mother sent him to [[St. Paul's School (Concord, New Hampshire)|St. Paul's School]]. He later majored in English literature at [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref name=times1 /&gt;  After his graduation from Harvard in 1934, he went to work at A&amp;P headquarters in New York in the statistical department.  He lived on a trust fund that generated about $1.5 million per year.

On 10 November 1936, he purchased from Alan Villiers the sailing ship [[Joseph Conrad (ship)|Joseph Conrad]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Villiers|first1=Alan|title=Cruise of the Conrad|date=1937|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|pages=379|url=http://opac.navalmarinearchive.com/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=11414}}&lt;/ref&gt; which he converted to a private yacht, and donated to the [[U.S. Maritime Commission]] as a sail training ship in 1939.

==Career==
In 1940, Hartford invested $100,000 to help start a newspaper, ''PM'', with [[Marshall Field III]] and worked as a reporter for the publication.  An avid sailor, he donated his [[yacht]] to the [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] at the start of [[World War II]].  During the war he was commissioned in the Coast Guard and commanded the Army supply ship ''FS-179'', commissioned in May 1944, in the Pacific Theater.  Hartford twice accidentally ran the ship aground.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/20/arts/design/20hartford.html&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, he moved to Los Angeles and attempted to purchase [[Republic Pictures]] and [[RKO Studios]] from [[Howard Hughes]]. Huntington also started a modeling agency and an artists' colony, and opened a theater.&lt;ref name=times1 /&gt;

In the 1950s, Hartford purchased a penthouse duplex on the 13th and 14th floors of [[Beekman Place (Manhattan)|One Beekman Place]] in the 1950s after moving from an apartment at the River House in New York City. He owned a home called "Pompano" on 240 El Vedado Drive in [[Palm Beach, Florida|Palm Beach]], a {{convert|150|acre|km2|adj=on}} estate in [[Mahwah, New Jersey]] called "Melody Farm", a {{convert|160|acre|km2|adj=on}} Hollywood estate known as "The Pines" (also known as [[Runyon Canyon Park]]), a townhouse in London, a home in [[Juan-les-Pins]] France and a house on [[Paradise Island]] in the [[Bahamas]].&lt;ref name="The Benefactor"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,939906,00.html|title=The Benefactor|date=March 2, 1962|work=[[Time Magazine]] | accessdate=May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hartford owned Huntington Hartford Productions which produced several films including the [[Abbott and Costello]] film, ''[[Africa Screams]]'', in 1949. In 1950, Hartford produced ''[[Hello Out There]]'', the last film of [[James Whale]], the acclaimed director of the [[Frankenstein (1931 film)|1931 version of ''Frankenstein'']].  He produced several films starring Marjorie Steele and encouraged her to become an artist.&lt;ref name=times1 /&gt;

In 1955, Hartford founded the Oil Shale Corporation, later known as Tosco, and was its majority shareholder and chairman.  Tosco was later acquired by [[ConocoPhillips]].  He also set up the Denver Research Institute at the [[University of Denver]] to find alternate methods of oil extraction. During this period, he also wrote and produced ''The Master of Thornfield'', a stage adaptation of ''[[Jane Eyre]]'' that ran for two weeks in Cincinnati starring [[Errol Flynn]] as Mr. Rochester. This partnership led to Flynn staying in Hartford's pool-house briefly in 1957–58 and is the origin of a legend that "The Pines" was Flynn's estate. Later, Hartford produced the play on Broadway.&lt;ref name=times1 /&gt; In 1964, Hartford offered The Pines as a gift to the city but was turned down by Mayor [[Sam Yorty]]. As Lloyd Wright recalled in 1977, "Here was this very wealthy man, and he wanted to give something very stunning to Hollywood. The Chambers of Commerce, the hotel owners and the various businesses were jealous of the park and with the help of the city officials, the city refused to give us permits. Hunt was so angry that he wanted to get out immediately and sold the property to [Jules] Berman who destroyed the mansion and let the place run down."{{cite quote|date=November 2014}}

When his uncle George Ludlum Hartford died in 1957, the trust set up by the elder George Huntington Hartford was liquidated and Hartford inherited his portion of the estate. The ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' estimated his wealth in 1969 as half a billion dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/583423642.html?dids=583423642:583423642&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Mar+09%2C+1969&amp;author=&amp;pub=Chicago+Tribune&amp;desc=Huntingon+Hartford+Is+Really+One+of+the+Good+Guys&amp;pqatl=google|title=Huntingon Hartford Is Really One of the Good Guys|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=March 9, 1969|accessdate=January 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959, [[Mike Wallace]] introduced him on television interview as being worth half a billion dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwR8Z4L_ccg|title=Mike Wallace interviews A&amp;P Supermarket Heir Huntington Hartford|work=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]|date=May 12, 1959|accessdate=December 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Frenchcloisters.jpg|thumb|left|14th-century French cloisters reassembled by Hartford on Paradise Island]]

In 1959, Hartford bought Hog Island in the Bahamas, renaming it [[Paradise Island]]. He developed it over the next three years hoping to turn it into another [[Monte Carlo]]. One feature of his Ocean Club was a cloister built from the disassembled stones of a monastery that [[William Randolph Hearst]] had stored in a Florida warehouse.&lt;ref name="The Benefactor"/&gt; In an interview with [[David Frost]] on British television, Hartford stated that the flag he created for Paradise Island was in the shape of a "P" and that he wanted to put it on the moon as a symbol of peace for the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1511987|title=The David Frost Show|work=[[IMDB]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hartford was responsible for getting the gambling license for Paradise Island by hiring Sir [[Stafford Sands]], a Bahamian lawyer.

In 1969, Hartford produced the Broadway show ''[[Does a Tiger Wear a Necktie?]]'', which opened at the [[Belasco Theater]] starring the then-unknown actor [[Al Pacino]]. Pacino won a [[Tony Award|Tony]] for his performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000199/bio|title=Al Pacino biography|work=[[IMDB]]|accessdate=January 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Patronage of the arts===
[[Image:2 Columbus Circle.jpg|thumb|upright|Huntington Hartford funded the Gallery of Modern Art at 2 Columbus Circle]]

Hartford was a patron of the arts, building an artists colony above Los Angeles and later a gallery in New York City, and his opinions on the arts were equally strong. He criticized Abstract Expressionists, believing they had ushered in a great "ice age of art," freezing out the grand traditions of music, painting and sculpture; he described [[Pablo Picasso]] as a "mountebank".&lt;ref name=LAT011009&gt;Sam Watters, [http://www.latimes.com/features/la-hm-lostla10-2009jan10,0,2361475.story Colony in Pacific Palisades nurtured top artists in 1950s, 1960s], ''Los Angeles Times'', January 10, 2009, accessed August 19, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond expressionism, he derided the "[[beatnik]], the [[Existentialist]], the juvenile delinquent, the zaniest of abstract art, the weirdest aberrations of the mentally unbalanced, the do-nothing philosophy of [[Zen Buddhism]]" as a result of wanton "abuse of liberty and freedom."&lt;ref name=LAT011009/&gt; He had strong opinions against the work of [[Tennessee Williams]], [[T. S. Eliot]], and [[Willem de Kooning]], as well as art dealer [[Sidney Janis]].&lt;ref name=LAT011009/&gt;

To support the art that he enjoyed, Hartford built an artists' colony in [[Rustic Canyon, Los Angeles|Rustic Canyon]], above the [[Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles|Pacific Palisades]] neighborhood of Los Angeles. Buying more than 150 acres in 1948, he hired [[Lloyd Wright]] (son of [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]) to adapt existing structures and design new ones. When it opened in 1951, it had more than a dozen cottages and a central dining room for distinguished artists, composers and craftspeople who won scholarships for one to six-month retreats.&lt;ref name=LAT011009/&gt; For nearly 15 years, more than 400 colony artists generated international success with exhibitions, concerts, theater performances and [[Pulitzer Prize]]s; included among them were composers [[Ernst Toch]] and [[Ruth Shaw Wylie]], writer and activist [[Max Eastman]], and painter [[Edward Hopper]].&lt;ref name=LAT011009/&gt;

Hartford also renovated and opened a theater which he renamed the [[Huntington Hartford Theater]], which opened in 1954. For ten years the Hartford Theater was Los Angeles's premier venue for Broadway-scale productions featuring the stars of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.themontalban.com/history-of-our-theater/ |title=History of Our Theatre |publisher=Ricardo Montalbán Theatre |accessdate=February 25, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170305171704/http://www.themontalban.com/history-of-our-theater/ |archive-date=March 5, 2017 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hartford's taste for Los Angeles began to wane, however, after the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]] rejected an exhibition he proposed. He decided to build his own museum in New York City, the 1964 Gallery of Modern Art on New York's Columbus Circle, declaring that building a museum in Los Angeles was like putting up "a theater in [[Oklahoma]]" due to a lack of audience.&lt;ref name=LAT011009/&gt; With the financial commitment to a new museum in New York and tiring of his art colony, he asked local government officials and wealthy patrons to contribute to the colony's support. Lacking what he felt would be sufficient commitment, he shut down the colony in 1965&lt;ref name=LAT011009/&gt; (he had sold the Huntington Hartford Theater in 1964).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/9863 |title=Ricardo Montalban Theater |work=Cinema Treasures |accessdate=February 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art collection===
Hartford owned an extensive art collection.  In an interview by [[Edward R. Murrow]] on his show ''[[Person to Person]]'' he gave a tour of the collection at his Beekman Place apartment including [[Rembrandt]]'s "Portrait of a man, half-length, with his arms akimbo", which sold at [[Christie's]] auction house in London on December 8, 2009 for $33 million, a world record for a Rembrandt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/sep/18/rembrandt-portrait-sale|title=Rembrandt for sale|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=September 18, 2009|first=Maeve|last=Kennedy|accessdate=May 4, 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To house his extensive collection of 19th- and 20th-century art, Hartford built the Gallery of Modern Art at [[2 Columbus Circle]] in Manhattan which opened in 1964.  Pointedly, it did not include [[Abstract Expressionism]] which Hartford panned in his book, ''Art or Anarchy''.  Hartford was a patron of the architect [[Edward Durell Stone]] who designed the modernist marble-clad structure often derided as the "lollipop building".  Stone had previously designed the [[Museum of Modern Art]] for the [[Rockefeller]] family. Hartford commissioned [[Salvador Dalí]] to paint [[The Discovery of America by Christopher Columbus]] for the museum's opening. The museum also included Hartford's paintings by [[Monet]], [[Manet]], [[Degas]], and [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]]. Hartford closed the museum after five years. Later the building housed the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs and was recently rebuilt with a new facade to house the [[Museum of Arts and Design]].

==Personal life==
Hartford was married four times, all ending in divorce, and had five children. His mother intended Huntington to marry [[Doris Duke]], but in April 1931, Huntington married Mary Lee Epling, the 18-year-old daughter of a dentist from Covington, West Virginia. They divorced in 1939.&lt;ref name=times1 /&gt; In 1938, Huntington had a son, Edward "Buzzy" Barton, with dancer Mary Barton.&lt;ref name=melia&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/topstories/2008-05-19-3416697470_x.htm|title=A&amp;P heir Huntington Hartford dies at age 97|last=Melia|first=Michael|date=May 19, 2008|publisher=usatoday.com|accessdate=November 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hartford supported the boy financially but refused to legally acknowledge him as his son. In 1967, Edward Barton died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2004/12/hartford200412#|title=Hostage of Fortune|last=Andrews|first=Suzanna|date=December 2004|publisher=vanityfair.com|page=3|accessdate=November 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Huntington's second wife was Marjorie Steele, an aspiring actress whom Hartford married in 1949.  The couple had two children, Catherine (born 1950) and John Hartford (born 1958). The couple divorced in 1960.&lt;ref name=times1 /&gt; Catherine Hartford died of a drug overdose in June 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glamourgirlsofthesilverscreen.com/show/123/Huntington+Hartford/index.html|title=The Life and Times of Huntington Hartford|publisher=glamourgirlsofthesilverscreen.com|accessdate=November 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Hartford later became a musician and music teacher. He died of [[throat cancer]] on April 15, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newmilfordspectrum.com/news/article/John-Hartford-57-enjoyed-teaching-music-1345665.php|title=John Hartford, 57, enjoyed teaching music|date=April 20, 2011|publisher=newmilfordspectrum.com|accessdate=November 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, Hartford married Diane Brown at Melody Farm in [[Mahwah, New Jersey]].  They had a daughter, Cynara Juliet, before divorcing in 1970.  Five years later, he married Elaine Kay but was divorced again in 1981.&lt;ref name="Diliberto"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Diliberto|first=Gioia|date=June 9, 1986|title=Huntington Hartford's Third Wife, Diane, Claims Her Ex Is Bedrugged, Bedeviled and Bewildered by Unsavory Friends|journal=People|volume=25|issue=23|issn=0093-7673|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20093833,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years and death==

'''James Emilius Broome''' (December 15, 1808 – November 23, 1883) was an American politician who was the [[List of Governors of Florida|third Governor]] of Florida.

== Early life and career ==

Broome was born in [[Hamburg, Aiken County, South Carolina|Hamburg, South Carolina]] and moved to Florida in 1837. He engaged in the mercantile business until he retired in 1841. In that same year, Governor [[Richard Keith Call]] appointed him to the position of [[Probate|Probate Judge]] of [[Leon County, Florida|Leon County]]. He served in that position until 1848.

== Political life ==

He was elected governor in 1852 as a [[United States Democratic Party|Democrat]], and took office on October 3, 1853. He was an early [[States' rights|States'-Righter]]. During his term, the [[United States Whig Party|Whig Party]], the opposition to the [[United States Democratic Party|Democrats]] at the time, controlled the [[Florida State Legislature]]. He vetoed so many of the bills that were passed by the legislature that he became known as the "Veto Governor". After his gubernatorial stint ended on October 5, 1857, Broome served as a member of the [[Florida Senate]] in 1861. A large [[Planter (American South)|planter]], he was very sympathetic to the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] cause.

== Marriages ==

James E. Broome was married five times.  In 1865, he moved to New York City. On a visit with his son in [[DeLand, Florida]], Broome died in 1883.

'''Joe Louis Arena''' is a defunct multi-purpose [[arena]] in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]. Completed in 1979 at a cost of $57 million as a replacement for the [[Detroit Olympia]], it sits adjacent to [[Cobo Center]] on the bank of the [[Detroit River]] and is accessible by the [[Joe Louis Arena station]] on the [[Detroit People Mover]]. The venue is named after former heavyweight champion [[boxer]] [[Joe Louis]], who grew up in Detroit.

It was the home of the [[Detroit Red Wings]] of the [[National Hockey League]]&lt;ref name="pistons"/&gt; and the second oldest NHL venue after [[Madison Square Garden]] until the start of the [[2017–18 NHL season]]. Joe Louis Arena is owned by the city of Detroit, and operated by [[Olympia Entertainment]], a subsidiary of team owner [[Ilitch Holdings]].&lt;ref name="holdings"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.olympiaentertainment.com/about-olympia-entertainment|title=About Olympia Entertainment|accessdate=July 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017, the Red Wings hosted their final game at Joe Louis Arena; the venue was succeeded by the new [[Little Caesars Arena]], in [[Midtown Detroit]], beginning with the 2017–18 season. Joe Louis Arena will be demolished, and its site slated for redevelopment. The arena closed on July 30, 2017. Demolition was scheduled to begin in September 2017, but Olympia renewed the lease of the arena with the city and are using it as storage and offices until November 2017. Olympia Entertainment moved out in November 2017, and demolition is planned to begin sometime in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.freep.com/story/money/business/2018/02/03/demolition-detroit-joe-louis-arena/1088694001/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Joe Louis Arena replaced the [[Olympia Stadium]], where the [[Detroit Red Wings]] had played since 1927. The neighborhood around the Olympia had gradually deteriorated, especially after the [[1967 Detroit riot]]. After two murders near the Olympia, Red Wings owner [[Bruce Norris (ice hockey)|Bruce Norris]] seriously considered moving to a proposed arena in suburban [[Pontiac, Michigan|Pontiac]]. However, the city of Detroit countered with a proposal for a new riverfront arena at one-third of the rent Pontiac was offering. The package also gave the Red Wings operational control of the arena, nearby [[Cobo Arena]] and nearby lots.

The arena hosted its first event on December 12, 1979: a college basketball game between the [[1979–80 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team|University of Michigan]] and the [[Detroit Titans men's basketball|University of Detroit]].{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} The Red Wings played their first game at Joe Louis Arena on December 27, 1979, hosting the [[St. Louis Blues]].

Joe Louis Arena was the site of the [[1987 NHL Entry Draft]], which marked the first NHL Entry Draft to be held in the United States. In 1980, the arena hosted the [[1980 Republican National Convention|Republican National Convention]] that nominated [[Ronald Reagan]] as the Republican candidate for [[President of the United States]].

In 1990, color matrix boards were installed on the scoreboard; these were replaced by four Sony [[JumboTron]] video walls three years later, when the matrix boards were placed in the corners of the fascia. In 2006, LED video screens replaced the JumboTrons. The screens debuted November 22, 2006, when the Red Wings played the [[Vancouver Canucks]]. That same day, the arena's West Entrance was named the "[[Gordie Howe]] Entrance" in honor of the legendary Red Wing player, and a bronze statue of Howe was placed inside the entrance.

==Other tenants and events==

In 1995, the [[Detroit Junior Red Wings]] won the [[Ontario Hockey League]]'s [[J. Ross Robertson Cup]], defeating the [[Guelph Storm]].

Joe Louis Arena hosted college hockey events as part of [[College Hockey at The Joe]], the [[Great Lakes Invitational]], and the [[Big Ten Conference]] hockey tournament in 2015 and 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New Detroit Arena Will Be in Mix to Host Many Events|first=George|last=Sipple|url=http://www.freep.com/story/sports/nhl/red-wings/2014/09/24/detroit-red-wings-arena/16155149/|newspaper=Detroit Free Press|date=September 24, 2014|accessdate=November 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Detroit Pistons]] of the NBA used the arena for Game 5 of [[1984 NBA Playoffs#(4) Detroit Pistons vs. (5) New York Knicks|their 1984 playoff series]] against the [[New York Knicks]] when the [[Pontiac Silverdome]] was unavailable due to a scheduling conflict. In the game, Pistons star [[Isiah Thomas]] scored 16 points in the final 1:34 of regulation to send the game into overtime before the Pistons lost. The Pistons were forced to return to Joe Louis Arena for 15 games during the 1984–85 season, after the roof of the Silverdome collapsed during a snowstorm.

The National Hockey League's [[Detroit Red Wings]] hosted the [[Stanley Cup Finals]] at the arena six times (1995, 1997, 1998, 2002, 2008, and 2009), and won two of their Stanley Cup championships at Joe Louis Arena in 1997 and 2002. The 1998 Stanley Cup championship was won in Washington, D.C.'s [[MCI Center]] and the 2008 championship was won in Pittsburgh's [[Mellon Arena]]. The Red Wings lost in the Finals to New Jersey in 1995 at the [[Meadowlands Arena]] and lost on home ice in the 2009 Stanley Cup Finals to Pittsburgh.

Joe Louis Arena was the site of the decisive Game 5 of the [[2006 WNBA Finals]] between the [[Sacramento Monarchs]] and [[Detroit Shock]] on September 9, due to [[The Palace of Auburn Hills]] (the Shock's usual home arena) being used for a [[Mariah Carey]] concert on the same day. The Shock won the game 80–75 to clinch the championship.

Former [[Arena Football League]] team the [[Detroit Drive]] also had success during their time at the arena, playing in six consecutive ArenaBowls from 1988 to 1993 and winning four of them. Four of the games ([[ArenaBowl III]], [[ArenaBowl IV]], [[ArenaBowl V]] and [[ArenaBowl VII]]) were played in Joe Louis Arena.

Joe Louis Arena was the site of the [[2013 Skate America|2013 edition]] of the [[Skate America]] figure skating competition. In addition, Joe Louis Arena hosted the [[1994 U.S. Figure Skating Championships]], best known for the pre-competition attack on [[Nancy Kerrigan]] by associates of [[Tonya Harding]].

It was announced on May 7, 2015, that the [[Horizon League Men's Basketball Tournament]] would be held in Detroit beginning in 2016 under a five-year deal; the 2016 and 2017 tournaments were held at Joe Louis Arena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Moving Horizon League tourney to Detroit is all about branding|url=http://www.detroitnews.com/story/sports/college/2015/05/07/jla-to-host-horizon-league-basketball-tournament/70957924/|website=Detroit News|publisher=Digital First Media|accessdate=8 May 2015|date=May 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joe Louis Arena was also a [[concert]] venue. Until the Palace of Auburn Hills was built in 1988, Joe Louis Arena was Michigan's largest indoor arena for concerts. The first concert to take place there occurred on February 17, 1980,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url =http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/tours/800217ticket.jpg|title =February 17th, 1980 Rush ticket stub|date =|access-date =|website =|publisher =|last =|first =|deadurl =yes|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20160415110222/http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/tours/800217ticket.jpg|archivedate =2016-04-15|df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which [[Max Webster]] opened for the Canadian rock group [[Rush (band)|Rush]] To compensate for most of Joe Louis Arena's concert business being moved north following the opening of the Palace, the Red Wings began a tradition of playing a home game on [[New Year's Eve]]. Aside from [[Labor unrest|lockouts]] cancelling part or all of the [[1994–95 NHL lockout|1994–95]], [[2004–05 NHL lockout|2004–05]], and [[2012–13 NHL lockout|2012–13]] seasons, the Red Wings left the New Year's Eve date open in years they were scheduled to participate in the [[NHL Winter Classic]]. For New Year's Eve 2012 and 2013, the [[Zac Brown Band]] held concerts at the Joe. The 2012 date was open due to the planned 2013 Winter Classic that was postponed by lockout until [[2014 NHL Winter Classic|2014]].

'''John D. Rockefeller Jr. Memorial Parkway''' is a scenic road that connects [[Grand Teton National Park]] and [[Yellowstone National Park]] in the U.S. state of [[Wyoming]]. It is federally owned and managed by the [[National Park Service]]. It is named in remembrance of [[John D. Rockefeller Jr.]], a conservationist and philanthropist who was instrumental in the creation and enlargement of numerous [[national parks]] including [[Grand Teton National Park|Grand Teton]], [[Virgin Islands National Park|Virgin Islands]], [[Acadia National Park|Acadia]] and the [[Great Smoky Mountains National Park|Great Smoky Mountains]].

Created in 1972 through the authorization of the [[United States Congress]], and consisting of {{convert|24,000|acre}}, it also borders [[United States National Forest|National Forest]] lands and is an integral part of the [[Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem]]. [[Caribou-Targhee National Forest]] borders the parkway on the west and [[Bridger-Teton National Forest]] and the [[Teton Wilderness]] forms the eastern border.
[[File:JDR Parkway.JPG|right|thumb|The [[Snake River]] in [[Wyoming]]]]

The land was originally part of [[Teton National Forest]] and was transferred to the [[National Park Service]] from the United States Forest Service to assure an unbroken connection between Grand Teton and Yellowstone National Parks. The parkway road itself extends from the northern end of Grand Teton National Park, through the parkway lands, and then on to [[Geothermal areas of Yellowstone|West Thumb Geyser Basin]] in Yellowstone National Park, a distance of 27 miles (43&amp;nbsp;km). The 24,000-acre park is managed by Grand Teton National Park.

The parkway is a transitional zone in terms of [[geology]] with ancient [[lava]] beds being found in the north and the granitic rocks of the Teton Range in the south. The [[Snake River]] flows through the parkway as it heads south to [[Jackson Lake]] and is considered a prime [[trout]] [[fly fishing]] area. In Grand Teton and Yellowstone, [[grizzly bears]], [[American black bear|black bears]], [[moose]], [[Red Deer|elk]], [[bighorn sheep]] and [[mule deer]] can be found there. The [[Yellowstone fires of 1988]] affected the northern sections of the parkway consuming {{convert|4,000|acre}}). As of 2005, the forest had begun to be rejuvenated and wildlife habitat had actually increased due to better mix of meadow and forest lands. A major relocation project for the [[Flagg Ranch]] concession operation (consisting of a lodge, gas station, camp store, cabins and a campground) from along the Snake River to a point higher up and less visible from the road was completed in 2002. Rafting is a popular activity during the summer and guided snowmobile tours use the parkway as a starting point for trips into Yellowstone during the winter.

'''Lorenzo "Larry" J. Cruz''' (September 17, 1941 – feb. 8, 2008) was a [[Philippines|Filipino]] restaurateur who founded the LJC Restaurant Group, which operates several restaurants in the Philippines.&lt;ref name=mt&gt;{{cite news |title=Larry J.

Aguilar Cruz]].&lt;ref name=mt2&gt;{{cite news|author=Larry Cruz |title=My Mother Fely J |url=http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2007/may/13/yehey/weekend/20070513week2.html |publisher=Manila Times |date=2007-05-13 |accessdate=2008-04-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081005233036/http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2007/may/13/yehey/weekend/20070513week2.html |archivedate=October 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cruz was also a journalist and magazine publisher.

Before entering the restaurant business, Cruz was a reporter for the [[Manila Times]] and the [[Philippine Herald]]. In the 1960s, he joined the staff of a Hong Kong-based magazine. In the early years of the administration of [[President of the Philippines|Philippine President]] [[Ferdinand Marcos]], Cruz was a member of the presidential press office.&lt;ref name=mt/&gt;

Cruz, who was not a chef himself, established Café Adriatico in [[Malate, Manila]] in 1979.&lt;ref name=inq/&gt; The venture proved successful and helped revitalize the Malate area, other restaurants and cafes opening in the vicinity in the midst of the Adriatico's success. Cruz expanded his restaurant business with the opening of several other restaurants within [[Metro Manila]] through the LJC Restaurant Group. At the time of his death in 2008, Cruz had opened fourteen restaurants in the Philippines. Several of his restaurants featured Filipino and Kapampangan cuisine.

In the late 1980s, Cruz published ''Metro Magazine'', a city guide/political/lifestyle magazine inspired by ''[[New York (magazine)|New York Magazine]]'' and ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]''.&lt;ref name=inq2&gt;{{cite news |author=Thelma Sioson San Juan |title=Larry can't cook  |url=http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/lifestyle/lifestyle/view/20080207-117427/Larry-cant-cook  |publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer |date=2008-02-07 |accessdate=2008-04-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He later sold the magazine to [[Eugenio Lopez Jr.]] in order to finance the expansion of his restaurants.&lt;ref name=inq2/&gt;

Upon his death on February 4, 2008, following complications from cancer, Cruz was hailed at the time of his death as the leading Filipino "pioneer in theme or concept restaurants" and the man who had "shaped Philippine café society".&lt;ref name=inq&gt;{{cite news |author=Thelma Sioson San Juan |title=Larry Cruz, restaurateur, journalist, dies in US; 66 |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20080205-116845/Larry-Cruz-restaurateur-journalist-dies-in-US-66 |publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer |date=2008-02-05 |accessdate=2008-03-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080207055843/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20080205-116845/Larry-Cruz-restaurateur-journalist-dies-in-US-66 |archivedate=2008-02-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lewis Miller''' (July 24, 1829 &amp;ndash; February 17, 1899) was an [[Ohio]] businessman and philanthropist who made a fortune in the late 19th century as inventor of the first [[Combine harvester|combine]] (harvester-reaper machine) with the blade mounted efficiently in front of the driver, to the side of the horse(s), rather than pulled behind. His daughter Mina (1865–1947) married fellow Ohio inventor [[Thomas Alva Edison]] on February 24, 1886.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/edis/learn/historyculture/mina-miller-edison.htm|title=Mina Miller Edison - Thomas Edison National Historical Park (U.S. National Park Service)|website=www.nps.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Miller was born in [[Greentown, Ohio]]. He devoted much of his wealth to public service and to charitable causes associated with the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]], and was the inventor of the "[[Akron Plan]]" for Sunday schools, a building layout with a central assembly hall surrounded by small classrooms, a configuration Miller conceived with Methodist minister [[John Heyl Vincent]] and architect [[Jacob Snyder]]. The arrangement accommodated 1) a collective opening exercise for all the children; 2) small radiating classrooms for graded instruction in the uniform lesson of the day; and 3) a general closing exercise in the central assembly area.

[[John Heyl Vincent]] collaborating was baptist layman B.F. Jacobs devised a system to encourage Sunday school work, and a committee was established to provide the International Uniform Lesson Curriculum, also known as the "Uniform Lesson Plan".  By the 1800s, 80% of all new members were introduced to the church through Sunday school.&lt;ref&gt;"Sunday School Movement”, Dictionary of Christianity in America, InterVarsity Press, 1990, p 1147&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1874, interested in improving the training of Sunday school teachers for the Uniform Lesson Plan, Miller and Vincent worked together again to found what is now the [[Chautauqua Institution]] on the shores of [[Chautauqua Lake|Chautauqua Lake, New York]].

Miller died in 1899 of [[kidney disease]] and was buried in [[Glendale Cemetery]] in Akron, Ohio.&lt;ref&gt;Vigil, Vicki Blum (2007). ''Cemeteries of Northeast Ohio: Stones, Symbols &amp; Stories''. Cleveland, OH: Gray &amp; Company, Publishers. {{ISBN|978-1-59851-025-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''MIT Global Startup Workshop (MIT GSW)''' is a flagship event of the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)|url = http://mit.edu/|access-date = 2016-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; run by a student group in association with [[Martin Trust Center for MIT Entrepreneurship]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Home {{!}} Martin Trust Center for MIT Entrepreneurship |url = http://entrepreneurship.mit.edu/|access-date = 2016-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; the MIT Legatum Center for Development and Entrepreneurship,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Home {{!}} MIT Legatum Center|url = https://legatum.mit.edu/|access-date = 2016-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the MIT Regional Entrepreneurship Acceleration Program (MIT REAP).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = MIT Regional Entrepreneurship Acceleration Program|url = http://reap.mit.edu/|access-date = 2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

MIT GSW is an annual conference that brings together entrepreneurs, students, investors, and key stakeholders from across the world to accelerate the entrepreneurial ecosystem of a host region. Through a series of tailored workshops, panels and keynote speakers, MIT GSW aims to share the entrepreneurial practices that have empowered thousands of companies to launch from MIT. 

Each year, about 30 MIT students, alumni, and staff organize the conference in close collaboration with partners from a different host country, tailoring the conference to the local cultural needs of the startup ecosystem in the country. Since 1998, the organization has held 21 international workshops across 6 continents.

The 21st edition of MIT GSW was held in [[Bangkok]], Thailand from 26–28 March 2018 in collaboration with [[Sasin Graduate Institute of Business Administration of Chulalongkorn University|Sasin School of Management]] and the MIT Association of Thailand.

== History ==
The MIT Global Startup Workshop (MIT GSW) was founded in 1997 when the MIT $50K (now the [[MIT $100K Entrepreneurship Competition|MIT $100K]]) Entrepreneurship Competition received numerous queries from around the world from organizations interested in starting and improving their own business plan competitions (BPCs). The first MIT GSW was held in Cambridge, Massachusetts in March 1998. A decade later, in 2007 the MIT GSW expanded its mission to include all aspects of the entrepreneurial ecosystem. Since its founding, the MIT GSW has held 21 international workshops across 6 continents, reached participants from over 70 nations, and grown to become the premier workshop for fostering global entrepreneurship.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title=Join Leading Entrepreneurs at the MIT Global Startup Workshop|url=https://alum.mit.edu/slice/join-leading-entrepreneurs-mit-global-startup-workshop-march-28-30|website=SLICE of MIT|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|accessdate=16 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mihail Melas''' ({{lang-el|Μιχαήλ Μελάς}}, 1833–1897) was a [[Greece|Greek]] politician and merchant, who served as [[Mayor of Athens]] in 1891–1894.

==Biography==
He was born in [[Syros]], the son of Georgios Melas, a member of the ''[[Filiki Eteria]]'' and the scion of a distinguished [[Epirote]] family.  He studied law in [[Paris]] and became involved with commerce at an early age, importing Russian wheat to [[London]] and [[Marseilles]]. From these activities he amassed a large fortune.

In 1874, Melas settled permanently in [[Athens]], where he soon achieved a distinguished place among Athenian high society. He played a crucial role in the foundation of the Athens Club in 1875, the Greek capital's oldest and most exclusive [[gentlemen's club]], and served as its president in 1882–1886 and 1888–1897. In 1890, he was elected to the [[Greek Parliament]] for [[Attica]]. He became mayor of Athens in 1891, holding the office until 1894, after an unsuccessful first attempt in 1883, when he lost to [[Dimitrios Soutsos]]. Melas also served in the founding board of the [[Hellenic Red Cross]], and as chairman of the ''[[Ethniki Etaireia]]'', a secret nationalist society, which played a major role in the outbreak of the disastrous [[Greco-Turkish War of 1897]]. Melas is also notable as one of the first Athenians to build a house in [[Kifissia]], then a suburban summer resort for the capital's wealthy families. He was also an avid art collector, and during his stay in Marseilles, he chaired the local French Cultural Club for several years. In 1886–88 he served as president of the ''[[Filekpaideftiki Etaireia]]'' ("Learned Society", a charitable educational society founded in 1836).

== Family ==
He was married with Eleni Voutsina and had seven children: Maria, wife of Ektoras Romanos, chamberlain of [[Prince Nicholas of Greece]]; [[Anna Mela-Papadopoulou|Anna]], wife of the landowner Apostolos Papadopoulos; Georgios (1866–1931) a judge and private secretary of King [[Constantine I of Greece|Constantine I]]; [[Pavlos Melas|Pavlos]] (1870–1904), an [[Hellenic Army|Army]] officer and hero of the [[Macedonian Struggle]]; [[Leon M. Melas|Leon]] (1872–1905), a lawyer and politician; [[Konstantinos Melas]] (1874–1953), a [[Hellenic Navy|Navy]] officer and politician; and [[Vassileios M. Melas|Vassilios]] (1879–1956), a General and also president of the Athens Club.

'''Miguel Santiago''' is an [[American people|American]] [[politician]], currently serving in the [[California State Assembly]], where he serves as chairman of the Communications and Conveyance Committee.&lt;ref&gt;http://acom.assembly.ca.gov/&lt;/ref&gt; Santiago is a [[California Democratic Party|Democrat]] representing the [[California's 53rd State Assembly district|53rd Assembly District]], which encompasses parts of [[Downtown Los Angeles]] and [[East Los Angeles, California|East Los Angeles]].

Santiago is a member of the California Latino Legislative Caucus.&lt;ref&gt;http://latinocaucus.legislature.ca.gov/member-directory&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to being elected to the Assembly in 2014, he was a member of the [[Los Angeles Community College District]] Board of Trustees.&lt;ref&gt;http://laccd.edu/Board/Pages/Miguel-Santiago.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; He also served as District Director to former [[List of Speakers of the California State Assembly|Assembly Speaker]] [[John A. Perez|John Pérez]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.laccd.edu/Board/PublishingImages/Miguel-Santiago.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

==Net Neutrality Bill Co-Authorship==
Santiago co-authored [https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB822 S.B. 822] alongside Senator [[Scott Wiener]], legislation that would strengthen [[Net neutrality in the United States|net neutrality]] protections in California. Hours after being signed into law by Governor [[Jerry Brown]], a Motion for Preliminary [[Injunction]] was filed by the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]]. Both parties have agreed to wait until a separate court case in the D.C. Circuit Court is decided before moving on. As part of the agreement, the law is not currently being enforced and the injunction was withdrawn. 

After passing the [[California_State_Senate|California Senate]],&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billVotesClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB822|title=Bill Votes|website=leginfo.legislature.ca.gov|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; S.B. 822 was amended by Miguel Santiago in June 2018.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/06/20/us/ap-us-net-neutrality-california.html&lt;/ref&gt;  SB-822 would restore [[Barack Obama|Obama]]-era rules that the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]-controlled [[Federal Communications Commission]] rolled back in December, 2017.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://biglawbusiness.com/lawmaker-changes-cloud-calif-net-neutrality-bill-outlook/|title=Lawmaker Changes Cloud Calif. Net Neutrality Bill Outlook|access-date=2018-06-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Santiago's amendments removed all provisions of the bill's net neutrality protections that were not in the text of the 2015 Open Internet Order, leaving in only those that were in the two-pages of rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/blog/2018/06/failing-real-test-sb-822-no-longer-restores-all-lost-net-neutrality-protections|title=Failing the Real Test: SB 822 No Longer Restores All the Lost Net Neutrality Protections|website=cyberlaw.stanford.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; This prompted the bill's original sponsor, Senator Scott Wiener, to pull his support for his own bill and declare that it had been "hijacked" and that he was "not interested in passing a bill that is watered down so severely." &lt;ref&gt;https://www.commondreams.org/news/2018/06/20/telecom-backed-democrat-california-just-mutilated-nations-strongest-state-net&lt;/ref&gt; The changes also included deleting a large section of definitions, which critics claim could make it more difficult for California's attorney general to prosecute violations of the legislation.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/06/20/californias-net-neutrality-legislation-just-got-watered-down-in-a-big-way/&lt;/ref&gt; 

The amendments, published less than 12 hours before the hearing, were approved 8-0[6] by the Communications and Conveyance committee, which Santiago chairs, on June 20, 2018. That vote occurred before Wiener could argue against them and before any testimony. After the testimony, the amended bill was approved 8-2.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://sd11.senate.ca.gov/news/20180620-senator-wiener%E2%80%99s-statement-gutting-net-neutrality-bill-assembly-committee|title=Senator Wiener’s Statement on Gutting of Net Neutrality Bill in Assembly Committee|date=2018-06-20|work=Senator Scott Wiener|access-date=2018-06-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/06/rampant-corruption-assembly-committee-gutted-californias-net-neutrality&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents of the amended version stated that Santiago's changes would create loopholes through which [[Internet service provider|broadband providers]] could charge fees to content providers while exempting their own content from any data caps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billVotesClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB822|title=Bill Votes|website=leginfo.legislature.ca.gov|access-date=2018-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://calchannel.granicus.com/MediaPlayer.php?view_id=7&amp;clip_id=5632|title=Assembly Communications and Conveyance Committee  - Jun 20th, 2018|website=calchannel.granicus.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.latimes.com/opinion/la-ol-enter-the-fray-net-neutrality-bill-neutered-in-the-fine-1529530738-htmlstory.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wired.com/story/california-net-neutrality-bill-was-hijacked-lawmaker-says/&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of the changes contend that without them broadband providers would not be allowed to offer free mobile data that doesn't count against users' caps, harming consumers, and that net neutrality in general would discourage providers from improving their [[Internet_backbone#Infrastructure|network infrastructure]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sacbee.com/opinion/op-ed/article213519679.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Representatives of major ISPs continue to oppose the bill, even in its amended form.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

State Assemblyman Miguel Santiago has received over $60,000 from telecom [[lobbyists]], with [[AT&amp;T]] and [[Comcast]] being the top telecom contributors, over the course of his assembly career.&lt;ref&gt;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QcUCKnY7pDPf4iSLuyk3xgFei33JySJhAFV1w5OMMz8/edit#gid=0&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://votesmart.org/candidate/campaign-finance/151853/miguel-santiago#.WyhL_xJKhE4%5D&lt;/ref&gt; However, Wiener said that despite the "strenuous disagreement here, [...] it’s not about campaign contributions" and that the telecoms "spent a lot of money in California targeting members with Twitter and Facebook ads, doing robo-calls to seniors telling them their bills are going to go up, that this bill is going to make your monthly payment go up. They flooded the capitol with lobbyists."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

On June 6, 2018, Santiago released a [https://a53.asmdc.org/press-releases/20180622-assemblymember-miguel-santiago-issues-statement-net-neutrality press statement] saying that his amendments were intended to help "deliver a bill that could withstand legal challenges from the telecommunications industry" and that "we ran out of time" to reach an agreement with Wiener. Knowing Wiener would not support the changes, the committee "took action to insert amendments without his consent to keep the bill moving." Santiago expressed regret at the "legislative maneuverings" required to advance the bill and that he does not "envision policy being created in this manner." The public response was intense, and Santiago stated that his family had received threats and that offensive memes smearing his wife and children had been shared online. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://a53.asmdc.org/press-releases/20180622-assemblymember-miguel-santiago-issues-statement-net-neutrality|title=Assemblymember Miguel Santiago Issues Statement on Net Neutrality|date=2018-06-22|work=Official Website - Assemblymember Miguel Santiago Representing the 53rd California Assembly District|access-date=2018-06-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/business/national-business/article213665394.html|title=California lawmaker faces harsh attacks over net neutrality|work=charlotteobserver|access-date=2018-06-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Money Cash.jpg|thumb|400x400px|Overheads and direct costs, when combined, equals total expenses endured by a business.]]
In business, '''overhead''' or '''overhead expense''' refers to an ongoing [[expense]] of operating a business. Overheads are the [[expenditure]] which cannot be conveniently traced to or identified with any particular cost unit, unlike operating expenses such as raw material and labor. Therefore, overheads cannot be immediately associated with the products or services being offered, thus do not directly generate profits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= PMO and Project Management Dictionary - PM Hut |url= http://www.pmhut.com/pmo-and-project-management-dictionary|website = www.pmhut.com |accessdate= 2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, overheads are still vital to business operations as they provide critical support for the business to carry out profit making activities.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = What is overhead? - Questions &amp; Answers - AccountingTools|url = http://www.accountingtools.com/questions-and-answers/what-is-overhead.html|website = www.accountingtools.com|accessdate = 2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, overhead costs such as the rent for a factory allows workers to manufacture products which can then be sold for a profit. Such expenses are incurred for output generally and not for particular work order; e.g., wages paid to watch and ward staff, heating and lighting expenses of factory, etc. Overheads are also very important cost element along with direct materials and direct labor.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Overheads are often related to [[accounting]] concepts such as [[fixed cost]]s and [[indirect costs]].

Overhead expenses are all costs on the income statement except for direct labor, direct materials, and direct expenses. Overhead expenses include accounting fees, [[advertising]], [[insurance]], interest, legal fees, labor burden, [[renting|rent]], repairs, supplies, taxes, telephone bills, travel expenditures, and [[utilities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Calculating overhead and price {{!}} Missouri Business Development Program|url = http://missouribusiness.net/article/calculating-overhead-and-price/|website = missouribusiness.net|accessdate = 2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are essentially two types of business overheads: administrative overheads and manufacturing overheads.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Effects of Lean Manufacturing|last = Cook ; Graser|first = Cynthia ; John|publisher = RAND Corporation|year = 2001|isbn = |location = |pages = 103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Administrative overheads ==
Administrative overheads include items such as utilities, strategic planning, and various supporting functions. These costs are treated as overheads due to the fact that they aren't directly related to any particular function of the organization nor does it directly result in generating any [[profit (accounting)|profit]]s. Instead, these costs simply take on the role of supporting all of the business' other functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Administrative Costs and Overhead|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/paul-brest/administrative-costs-and_b_162505.html|website = The Huffington Post|accessdate = 2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Universities regularly charge administrative overhead rates on research. In the U.S. the average overhead rate is 52%, which is spent on building operation, administrative salaries and other areas not directly tied to research.&lt;ref&gt;Tracy Jan. Research giants win on federal funding: Fend off US bid to cut overhead payments. Boston Globe. March 18, 2013. https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/nation/2013/03/17/harvard-mit-and-other-research-schools-thwart-obama-administration-effort-cap-overhead-payments/Nk5PT0Mc8MQZihFVNs5gNK/story.html&lt;/ref&gt; Academics have argued against these charges. For example, [[Benjamin Ginsberg (political scientist)|Benjamin Ginsberg]] showed how overhead rates are primarily used to subsidize ballooning administrative salaries and building depreciation, neither of which directly benefit research; although it does benefit the administrators that determine university policy in his book [[The Fall of Faculty]].  An article written by [[Joshua Pearce]] in [[Science (journal)|Science]] argued that overhead accounting practices hurt science by removing funds from research and discouraging the use of less-expensive [[open source hardware]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pearce | first1 = Joshua M. | year = 2016 | title = Undermined by overhead accounting | url = http://science.sciencemag.org/content/352/6282/158.2 | journal = Science | volume = 352 | issue = | pages = 158–159 | doi = 10.1126/science.352.6282.158-b }}&lt;/ref&gt; He went into detail on the accounting showing how millions were wasted each year on overhead cash grabs by university administrators in [[ZME Science]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zmescience.com/science/antiquated-accounting-costs-millions/  How Antiquated Accounting Costs American Science Millions a Year]. ''ZME Science'' 3.9.2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Examples ===

==== Employee salaries ====
This includes mainly monthly and annual [[Salary|salaries]] that are agreed upon. They are considered overheads as these costs must be paid regardless of sales and profits of the company. In addition, salary differs from wage as salary is not affected by working hours and time, therefore will remain constant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 1883513|title = Fixed Costs and Market Price|last = Bell|first = Spurgeon|date = 1918|journal = The Quarterly Journal of Economics|doi = 10.2307/1883513|pmid = |volume=32|pages=507}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, this would more commonly apply to more senior staff members as they are typically signed to longer tenure contracts, meaning that their salaries are more commonly predetermined.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Are Wages Paid to Temporary Personnel a Variable Cost?|url = http://smallbusiness.chron.com/wages-paid-temporary-personnel-variable-cost-38573.html|website = Small Business - Chron.com|accessdate = 2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Office equipment and supplies ====
This includes office equipment such as printer, fax machine, computers, refrigerator, etc. They are equipment that do not directly result in sales and profits as they are only used for supporting functions that they can provide to [[business operations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Fixed Costs: Definition, Formula &amp; Examples - Video &amp; Lesson Transcript {{!}} Study.com|url = http://study.com/academy/lesson/fixed-costs-definition-formula-examples.html|website = Study.com|accessdate = 2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, equipment can vary between administrative overheads and manufacturing overheads based on the purpose of which they are using the equipment. For example, for a printing company a printer would be considered a manufacturing overhead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 2391742|title = Research on the Size of Administrative Overhead and Productivity: Some Methodological Considerations|last = Dogramaci|first = Ali|date = March 1977|journal = Administrative Science Quarterly|doi = 10.2307/2391742|pmid = |volume=22|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== External legal and audit fees ====
This includes the cost of hiring external law and [[audit]] firms on behalf of the company. This would not apply if company has own internal lawyers and audit plans. Due to [[regulation]]s and necessary annual audits to ensure a satisfactory work place environment, these costs often cannot be avoided. Also, since these costs do not necessarily contribute directly to sales, they are considered as indirect overheads. Although in most cases necessary, these costs can sometimes be avoided and reduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 2549364|title = Fixed Costs|last = Lewis|first = Arthur W.|date = Nov 1946|journal = Economica|doi = 10.2307/2549364|pmid = |volume=13|pages=231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Company cars ====
Many companies provide usage of company cars as a [[Employee benefit|perk]] for their employees. Since these cars do not contribute directly to sales and profits, they are considered an overhead. Similar company perks that are a one-off or constant payment such as partner [[contract]] fees with a gym will also fall under administrative overheads.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Putting a Price Tag on Perks: Valuing employee benefits|last = BARRETT JR.|first = JOHN E.|publisher = American Bar Association|year = 2001|isbn = |location = |pages = 26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Travel and entertainment costs ====
This will include company-paid business travels and arrangements. As well as refreshments, meals, and entertainment fees during company gatherings. Although one might argue that these costs motivate workers to become more productive and efficient, the majority of economists agree that these costs do not directly contribute to sales and profits, therefore shall be categorized as an administrative overhead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 10.1086/587761|title = A Rent Extraction View of Employee Discounts and Benefits|last = Marino ; Zábojník|first = Anthony M. ; Ján|date = July 2008|journal = Journal of Labor Economics|doi = 10.1086/587761|pmid = |volume=26|pages=485–518}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these costs occurring periodically and sometimes without prior preparation, they are usually one-off payments and are expected to be within the company's [[budget]] for travel and entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 30189250|title = The Ultimate Management Perk|last = Mackiel|first = John J.|date = Dec 1996|journal = The Clearing House|doi = 10.1080/00098655.1996.9959406|pmid = |volume=70|pages=95–96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Manufacturing overheads ==
Manufacturing overheads are all costs endured by a business that is within the physical platform in which the product or service is created. Difference between manufacturing overheads and administrative overheads is that manufacturing overheads are categorized within a [[factory]] or office in which the sale takes place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://astro.temple.edu/~banker/Accounting/15%20An%20Empirical%20Study%20of%20Manufacturing%20Overhead%20Cost%20Drivers.pdf|title = An empirical analysis of manufacturing overhead cost drivers|last = Banker ; Potter ; Schroeder|first = Rajiv ; Gordon ; Roger G.|date = July 1994|journal = Journal of Accounting and Economics|doi = 10.1016/0165-4101(94)00372-c|pmid = |access-date = 2015-11-01|volume=19|pages=115–137}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst administrative overheads is typically categorized within some sort of [[Back office|back-office]] or supporting office. Although there are cases when the two physical buildings may overlap, it is the usage of the overheads that separates them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Chapter 46 Overhead Variances|url = http://www.unf.edu/~dtanner/dtch/dt_ch46.htm|website = www.unf.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Examples ===

==== Employee salaries ====
Although the general concept is identical to the example under administrative overheads, the key difference is the role of the employee. In the case of manufacturing overheads, employees would have roles such as [[Maintenance, repair, and operations|maintenance]] personnel, manufacturing [[managers]], materials management staff, and [[quality control]] staff. It would also include the set [[wage]]s for janitorial staff members. Once again, the key difference lies in the nature of their respective jobs and the physical location in which their jobs are carried out.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=8329411&amp;fileId=S0007680500028932|title = Early Cost Accounting for Internal Management Control|last = Johnson|first = Thomas H.|date = 11 June 2012|journal = Business History Review|doi = 10.2307/3113343|pmid = |access-date = 2015-11-01|volume=46|pages=466–474}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Depreciation of assets and equipment ====
This refers to the reduction in [[value (economics)|value]] of equipments as it becomes older and more obsolete. For example, if a printer has a potential useful life span of 5 years, the amount that it can be sold for will decrease each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Cost Management with a Strategic Emphasis|last = Blocher ; Berry|first = Edward ; William|publisher = Ohio State University Press|year = 1998|isbn = |location = Columbus, Ohio|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, this value in [[depreciation]] is calculated as a manufacturing overhead. Moreover, this also applies to vehicles as they tend to depreciate in value significantly after the first year. When calculating manufacturing overheads, [[accountant]]s mainly use two [[Accounting method|method]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s: straight-line method and declining balance method.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.gnucash.org/docs/v2.6/C/gnucash-guide/dep_value1.html|title = Estimating Valuation|date = |accessdate = 2015-11-01|website = GnuCash|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt;

==== Property Taxes on Production Facilities ====
Every single [[property]] unless government owned is subject to some form of [[property tax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Capitalization Period of Direct and Indirect Costs|url = https://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&amp;-Self-Employed/Capitalization-Period-of-Direct-and-Indirect-Costs|website = www.irs.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the [[tax]]es on production factories are categorized as manufacturing overheads as they are costs which cannot be avoided nor cancelled. In addition, property taxes do not change in relation to the business's profits or sales and will likely remain the same unless a change by the [[government administration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Indirect Costs|journal = Science|date = 1981-09-11|pages = 1198–1203|volume = 213|series = New Series|issue = 4513|first = Lionel F.|last = Jaffe|first2 = Herbert|last2 = Gursky|first3 = Samuel B.|last3 = Guze|first4 = John W.|last4 = Donahoe|first5 = Kenneth T.|last5 = Brown|doi=10.1126/science.213.4513.1198-b|jstor=1687322}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:The central gate factory «OCM».JPG|thumb|The rent for factory buildings is considered a manufacturing overhead]]

==== Rent of Factory Building ====
Unless the business decides to purchase land and build its own factory, it will be subject to some sort of [[renting|rent]] due to the amount of [[Capital accumulation|capital]] required to build a privately owned factory. Therefore, this rent must be paid to the landlord on a regular basis regardless of the performance of the business. Although the rent for the building provides the physical platform for the company to produce its products and services, it is not a direct contributor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Fixed Costs, Efficient Resource Management, and Conservation|journal = American Journal of Agricultural Economics|date = 2001-11-01|pages = 942–957|volume = 83|issue = 4|first = Jinhua|last = Zhao|first2 = David|last2 = Zilberman|doi=10.1111/0002-9092.00221|jstor=1244705}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Utilities for Factory ====
This would vary depending on how the [[utility bill]] is structured. In the case of it being an overhead, the utility bill is pre-negotiated meaning that the monthly utility bill will be the same regardless of the amount in which the factory actually consumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Electric Utilities--Costs and Performance|journal = Journal of Political Economy|date = 1962-08-01|pages = 406–407|volume = 70|issue = 4|first = Yoram|last = Barzel|doi=10.1086/258672|jstor=1861741}}&lt;/ref&gt; This will only be relevant in various countries where there is an option for standardized utility bills. However, due to the vast consumption of electricity, gas, and water in most factories, most companies tend to not have standardized utility bills as it tends to be more expensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://eit.umd.edu/~nsw/chbe446/HowToEstimateUtilityCosts-UlrichVasudevan2006.pdf|title = How to Estimate Utility Costs|date = April 2006|accessdate = 2015-11-01|website = |publisher = University of New Hampshire Press|last = Ulrich ; Vasudevan|first = Gael D. ; Palligarnai T.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Standardized utility bills are also oftentimes discouraged by governments as it leads to wastage of resources and [[Externalities|negative externalities of production]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://eml.berkeley.edu/~saez/course131/externalities1_ch05.pdf|title = Externalities: Problems and Solutions|date = |accessdate = 2015-11-01|website = 131 Undergraduate Public Economics|publisher = University of California Berkeley Press|last = Saez|first = Emmanuel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Application of Business Overheads ==
For most businesses, business overheads are calculated by [[accountant]]s for [[budget]]ing purposes but also often so the business has an idea of how much they must charge consumers in order to make a [[Profit (economics)|profit]]. The following are common accounting tools which take account of business overheads.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.leanconstruction.org/media/docs/IGLC02Kim-Ballard.pdf|title = OVERHEAD COSTS ANALYSIS|date = August 2002|accessdate = 2015-11-02|website = |publisher = University of Berkeley Press|last = Kim ; Ballard|first = Yong-Woo ; Glenn}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:CVP-FC-Contrib-PL-BEP.svg|thumb|A standard break-even analysis chart]]

=== Break-Even Analysis ===
The [[Break even analysis|break-even analysis]] determines the point which the business's revenue is equivalent to the costs required to receive that revenue. It first calculates a [[Margin of safety (accounting)|margin of safety]] (the point which the revenue exceeds the break-even point) as that is the "safe" amount which the revenue can fall whilst still remaining to be above the break-even point.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Break-Even Analysis Definition {{!}} Investopedia|url = http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/breakevenanalysis.asp?optm=sa_v2|website = Investopedia|accessdate = 2015-11-02|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The graph on the right shows a typical break-even chart. [[Contribution margin|Contribution]] refers to sales of the product or service, it can also be interpreted as the business's [[revenue]] stream. Fixed costs in this case serves the same purpose as business overheads, it will simply be shown as a straight horizontal line on the graph as shown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = An HBR Refresher on Breakeven Quantity|url = https://hbr.org/2015/06/an-hbr-refresher-on-breakeven-quantity|website = Harvard Business Review|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shut-Down Graph ===
In economics, revenue curves are often illustrated to show whether or not a business should stay in business, or shut down. In theory, if a business is able cover variable [[operational costs]] but unable to cover business overheads in the short run, the business should remain in business. On the other hand, if the business is not even able to cover [[operational costs]], it should shut down.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://people.oregonstate.edu/~emersonp/201/notes/12.pdf |title= Economics 201 Lecture 12 |date= |accessdate= 2015-11-02 |website= people.oregonstate.edu |publisher= Oregon State University |last= |first= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this rule largely differs depending on the size of the business, the business's cash-flow, and the [[Competition (economics)|competitive]] nature of the business, it serves as a model rule for most small competitive businesses to operate on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Microeconomics|last = Perloff|first = J.|publisher = Pearson|year = 2009|isbn = 0-321-56439-1|location = |pages = 237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Balance Sheet ===
[[Balance sheet]] is a financial statement which outlines a company's [[financial asset]]s, [[LIABILITIES|liabilities]], and [[Shareholder's Equity|shareholder's equity]] at a specific time. Both assets and liabilities are separated into two categories depending on their time frame; current and long-term. Business overheads in particular fall under current liabilities as they are costs for which the company must pay on a relatively short-term/immediate basis. Although the balance sheet by itself does not offer much information, it is a useful piece of financial information when combined with other documents such as the [[income statement]] or [[ratio analysis]] as it offers a diverse and well-rounded description of the company's financial position.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Balance Sheet: What Does It Mean?

The '''Riverplace Tower''' is a 28-floor office building on the south bank of the [[St. Johns River]] in [[Jacksonville, Florida]]. At the time of its construction, it was the tallest building in the state of Florida and was the defining landmark in Jacksonville's skyline.&lt;ref name=EMP/&gt;&lt;ref name=SKY&gt;[http://skyscraperpage.com/cities/?buildingID=119 "Riverplace Tower"] Skyscraper Page website, Database&lt;/ref&gt; On April 18, 2012, the [[American Institute of Architects]]'s Florida Chapter placed the building on its list of ''Florida Architecture: 100 Years. 100 Places'' as the '''Riverplace Tower / Formerly Gulf Life Tower'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aiaflatop100.org/Current-Standings.cfm Florida Architecture: 100 Years. 100 Places]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:GulfLifeJAX.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Gulf Life Tower in 1968.]]
The Auchter Company, Jacksonville's oldest general construction contractor, built the 542,000&amp;nbsp;ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; '''Gulf Life Tower''' for the Gulf Life Insurance Company in 1966. It was designed by the notable architect, [[Welton Becket]] and [[KBJ Architects]]. When completed in 1967, it was the tallest precast, post-tensioned concrete structure in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://direct.bl.uk/bld/PlaceOrder.do?UIN=158149873&amp;ETOC=RN&amp;from=searchengine British Library Direct: Concrete Products 2004, VOL 107; NUMB 10, pages 52-52]&lt;/ref&gt;

It remained Florida's tallest for five years until Miami's [[One Biscayne Tower]] was constructed in 1972.&lt;ref name=SKY /&gt;  
It was Jacksonville's tallest for eight years until the [[Independent Life Building]] (now the Wells Fargo Center) was built in 1974. In 2007, 40 years after its construction, Riverplace Tower was still the fifth tallest building in Jacksonville.&lt;ref name=EMP/&gt;

Gulf Life Insurance Company was merged into American General Life of Houston in 1991 and the Jacksonville Gulf Life Tower was unneeded and destined to be sold.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aig.com/American-General-Life-Accident_20_21374.html AIG website: Company history]&lt;/ref&gt; American General wanted $30 million, but the building was 24 years old and no longer a class "A" property. Several prospective buyers looked at the building, but the property stayed on the market for more than two years. For tax reasons, American General was desperate to sell during 1993 and accepted a cash offer from [[Gate Petroleum]] for substantially less than their asking price. Shortly thereafter, Gate began a multimillion-dollar renovation of the entire building and renamed it ''Riverplace Tower''.&lt;ref&gt;Peyton, H: "Newboy", page 159. Edwards Brothers, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

Building occupancy was 40% when the sale closed; within two years from the completion of the renovation, it had soared to nearly 95% and the building was restored to its former prominence.&lt;ref&gt;Brune-Mathis, Karen: [http://jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/090397/1b4barne.html "Barnett's buildings in question"] Florida Times-Union, September 3, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

The banner sign at the top of the building originally displayed "Gulf Life" in 1967. After Gulf Life was acquired by American General in 1991, it was changed to "SouthTrust", and the structure was known as the ''SouthTrust Building''. When SouthTrust and Wachovia merged in 2005, "Wachovia" signage was installed, but it was removed January 22, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, Jon M.: [http://jacksonville.com/video/news/metro/2011-01-23/watch-wachovia-signage-removed-riverplace-tower "Watch: Wachovia Signage Removed from Riverplace Tower"] Florida Times-Union, January 23, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1968, the University Club of Jacksonville has occupied the building's top floor. The private club is available members and their guests, or [[ClubCorp]] affiliates. There are approximately 1,300 members: business executives of both genders; older, long-term associates; and young professionals. The facility is a hub for networking and entertaining clients, as well as providing conference rooms and offices for conducting business in private. The club also offers two full service athletic facilities; one co-ed and one for men only.&lt;ref&gt;Capullo, Lori: [http://www.floridatrend.com/article.asp?aID=55522 "Private Business Clubs in Florida"] Florida Trend magazine, September 1, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.virtualtourist.com/travel/North_America/United_States_of_America/Florida/Jacksonville-763031/Local_Customs-Jacksonville-Skyscrapers_Architecture-BR-1.html Virtual tourist.com: Skyscrapers &amp; Architecture: Riverplace Tower and its little known dining spots]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description and tenants==
The structural system consists of precast concrete floorplates and a poured concrete core. The concrete grid on the outside of the building is the only support needed to hold up the structure, leaving the interior completely available for use. Each of the exposed beams consist of fourteen precast units held together with high strength post-tensioned steel cables. The beams cantilever 42 feet from the columns as they taper upward and inward. The color of the concrete façade comes from White quartz sand and white cement bonded to the surface.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/bu/?id=riverplacetower-jacksonville-fl-usa Emporis.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Gate River Run]] ''Hall of Fame'' was established in 2002 and is permanently located on the concourse level. Memorabilia from the event, which began in 1978, is on display, and a five-minute video gives visitors an overview of the race. Plaques for each of the 12 persons inducted into the HOF are on display.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gate-riverrun.com/hof.htm "Hall of Fame"] Gate River Run website&lt;/ref&gt;

The Southbank Grille is a public restaurant located on the second floor of the tower, and it offers an excellent view of the river and northbank through its glass, north-facing wall.

==Honors==
In honor of its 50th anniversary, the ''Precast/Prestressed Concrete Institute'' went through the arduous process of selecting the Seven precast concrete "Wonders". Their choices were: the Department of Housing &amp; Urban Development Headquarters in Washington, D.C.; '''Gulf Life Tower in Jacksonville, Fla.;''' Disney World Monorail in Orlando, Fla.; TransAmerica Pyramid in San Francisco, Calif.; Aurora Justice Facility and Municipal Center in Aurora, Colo.; Sunshine Skyway Bridge in Tampa Bay, Fla.; and the Blue Cross-Blue Shield Parking Structure in North Haven, Conn.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pci.org/publications/newsletters/etrends/issue_23.cfm Precast Concrete Institute publications: Issue 23]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an Architecture article in ''Time Magazine'', "(the) Gulf Life, placed in a shoddy, chaotic part of Jacksonville, is a tonic for its area, acts as an organizing beacon. And the bold Alcoa building…makes a positive contribution to San Francisco. Both buildings thus achieve excellence." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,838498-4,00.html Time Magazine: Aug. 02, 1968- To Cherish Rather than Destroy]&lt;/ref&gt;

Its [[business intelligence]] product includes both a back-end powered by in-chip technology that enables non-technical users to join and analyze [[big data|large data sets]] from multiple sources,&lt;ref name=ForbesMarch13 /&gt; and a front-end for creating [[data visualization|visualizations]], like dashboards and reports, on any device, including mobile.&lt;ref name=IncJune13 /&gt;&lt;ref name=NextWebApril13 /&gt;&lt;ref name=FierceOct12 /&gt;&lt;ref name=DataInformedAugust12 /&gt;&lt;ref name=GigaomApril13 /&gt;&lt;ref name=NocamelsApril13 /&gt;

== History ==
Sisense was founded in 2004 in Tel Aviv by Elad Israeli, Eldad Farkash, Aviad Harell, Guy Boyangu and Adi Azaria.&lt;ref name=Haaretz /&gt; The company worked in stealth mode on research and development until 2010, when initial investors, including [[Genesis Partners]], [[Opus Capital]] and Eli Farkash, provided $4 million in [[Series A round|Series A financing]].&lt;ref name=Haaretz /&gt;&lt;ref name=CrunchBase /&gt;

Amit Bendov was appointed CEO in July 2012.&lt;ref name=SVBJ12 /&gt; In April 2013, Sisense announced a $10 million [[Series B round|series B funding round]] led by [[Battery Ventures]], with participation from Genesis Partners and Opus Capital. In June 2014, new investor [[Draper Fisher Jurvetson]] Growth (DFJ Growth) led a $30 million series C funding round with participation from existing investors Battery Ventures, Genesis Partners and Opus Capital.&lt;ref name=TechCrunchJune14 /&gt;&lt;ref name=WSJjune14 /&gt;

In February 2013, as the first company in [[TechCrunch#CrunchBase|CrunchBase's]] "Developer Spotlight Program,"&lt;ref name="ForbesMarch13" /&gt; Sisense analyzed 10 years of CrunchBase data in a public interactive investment dashboard dubbed CrunchAnalytics.&lt;ref name="SisenseCB" /&gt; By analyzing a decade's worth of data about 100,000 companies, the dashboard provides the public with a research tool that enables users to query the data by different categories to see trends in investment over the past ten years.&lt;ref name="ForbesMarch13" /&gt;

In 2015, Amir Orad was appointed CEO. Orad previously served as CEO of [[NICE Actimize]].&lt;ref name="EnterpriseappstodayMarch2015"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.enterpriseappstoday.com/business-intelligence/startup-spotlight-sisenses-big-data-analytics.html|title=Startup Spotlight: Sisense’s Big Data Analytics|last=All|first=Ann|date=20 March 2015|work=Enterprise Apps Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GeektimeMarch2015"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.geektime.com/2015/03/23/from-a-145m-exit-to-ceo-of-sisense-amir-orad-could-lead-this-big-data-company-to-a-grand-future/|title=From a $145M exit to CEO of Sisense, Amir Orad could lead this big data company to a grand future|last=Weinglas|first=Simona|date=March 23, 2015|work=Geek Time}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.geektime.com/2015/03/23/from-a-145m-exit-to-ceo-of-sisense-amir-orad-could-lead-this-big-data-company-to-a-grand-future/|title=From a $145M exit to CEO of Sisense, Amir Orad could lead this big data company to a grand future|date=2015-03-23|work=Geektime|access-date=2018-06-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2016, the company announced a new $50 million funding round led by [[Bessemer Venture Partners]], with participation by  Battery Ventures, Draper Fisher Jurvetson, Genesis Partners and Opus Capital.&lt;ref name="WSJJan16"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/2016/01/07/under-new-ceo-sisense-raises-50m/|title=Under New CEO, Sisense Raises $50M|last=Gage|first=Deborah|date=January 7, 2016|work=Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company's software is used by companies in 49 countries.&lt;ref name="NextWebApril13" /&gt; Customers include [[Target Corporation|Target]].&lt;ref name="WSJnov12" /&gt; In February 2018, the company was listed as a Visionary on the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Analytics and Business Intelligence Platforms.&lt;ref name="Gartner18" /&gt;

In September 2018, the company announced another $80 million funding round led by Insight Venture Partners.&lt;ref name="80funding" /&gt;

== Technology ==
In April 2013, Sisense introduced an alternative to [[in-memory database|in-memory technology]] called In-Chip analytics,&lt;ref name=InfoNov13 /&gt; designed to maximize the disk, memory and CPU with resulting low latency.&lt;ref name=GigaomApril13 /&gt;

In May 2013, Sisense unveiled Prism 10X, which allows users to analyze 100 times more data at 10 times the speed of in-memory solutions. The company’s In-Chip Analytics technology couples a columnar database with smart algorithms that use the in-chip cache, RAM or disk as needed instead of relying solely on RAM or disk.&lt;ref name=KDNuggetsMay13 /&gt;&lt;ref name=BusinessIntelligenceNov13 /&gt;

In October 2013, Sisense introduced Crowd Accelerated BI,&lt;ref name=BusinessIntelligenceNov13 /&gt; a technology that allows companies to scale users by providing faster query results as load increases and scale to thousands of simultaneous users on a single box.&lt;ref name=DataNamiOct13 /&gt;&lt;ref name=DatabaseOct13 /&gt;

Each query is broken down to its basic components, which then helps the software decide which data to store on disk and which data to bring to memory. As more queries are catalogued, the software is able to more quickly recognize future similar queries and call up relevant data.&lt;ref name=ForbesOct13 /&gt;

In April 2017, Sisense introduced Sisense Pulse which provides alert when it detects results outside of normal parameters for a particular metric.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/12/sisense-pulse-uses-machine-learning-to-trigger-data-anomaly-alerts/|title=Sisense Pulse uses machine learning to trigger data anomaly alerts – TechCrunch|website=techcrunch.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A {{Nihongo|'''special purpose company'''|特定目的会社|tokutei mokuteki kaisha|abbreviated '''SPC''' or '''TMK'''}} is a type of [[corporation]] which can be formed under [[Japanese law]]. SPCs were enacted by the [[Diet of Japan]] in Law No. 105 of 1998.

The main features of an SPC are:

* An SPC can only be used for the {{Nihongo|fluidization (i.e. securitization) of assets|資産の流動化|shisan no ryūdōka}}. It cannot manage or dispose of assets, although it can commission these activities to a third party manager.
* If certain conditions are met, an SPC can write off the assets it distributes as losses for tax purposes, thus exempting those distributions from [[corporate tax]]ation.

SPCs are the only corporate entity which can make tax-free distributions under Japanese tax law as of 2006, and are an attractive alternative to [[general partnership]]s, [[tokumei kumiai]], [[Trust law|trust]]s or other tax-free alternatives in a number of [[investment]] transactions.

==Structure==
An SPC is formed by registering [[articles of incorporation]] with a Legal Affairs Bureau, a branch office of the Ministry of Justice. Each SPC must have at least one [[board of directors|director]] and at least one [[statutory auditor]].

==Investing in an SPC==
An SPC may issue any of five types of [[security|securities]] in exchange for an investment:

# {{Nihongo|Preferred investment certificates|優先出資証券|yūsen shusshi shōken}}, [[Stock|equity]] securities similar to shares of [[preferred stock]], where the bearers have rights to share in the profits of the company, but cannot participate in decision-making 
# {{Nihongo|Special [[Bond (finance)|bond]]s|特定社債券|tokutei shasai ken}}
# {{Nihongo|Special [[commercial paper]]|特定約束手形|tokutei yakusoku tegata}}
# {{Nihongo|Convertible special bonds|転換特定社債|tenkan tokutei shasai}}
# {{Nihongo|Special bonds with subscription rights for new preferred investment certificates|新優先出資証券引受権付特定社債|shin yūsen shusshi shōken hikiuke ken tsuke tokutei shasai}}

==Taxation==
In order for its distributions to be exempt from corporate taxes, an SPC must meet a number of criteria:

# Be registered on the national list of SPCs (maintained by the Prime Minister's office)
# Either:
#* Have ¥100,000,000 or more in outstanding special bonds, or
#* Have all of its outstanding bonds held by [[institutional investor]]s, or
#* Have more than fifty holders of preferred investment certificates, or
#* Have all of its outstanding preferred investment certificates held by institutional investors
# Conduct at least 50% of the total value of its equity and debt offerings within Japan
# Have an accounting period of one year or less
# Conform to the purposes permitted for SPCs throughout the tax year in question

== History ==

'''The HTML500''' was founded in 2013 by Canadian entrepreneurs Khurram Virani and Jeremy Shaki. Virani and Shaki are the co-founders of [[Lighthouse Labs]], the largest Canadian [[web developer]] [[Coding Bootcamp]] .&lt;ref name="biv"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.biv.com/article/2015/5/hybrid-coding-boot-camp-aims-bring-global-tech-sec/|title=‘Hybrid’ coding boot camp aims to bring tech sector to rural Canada &amp;#124; Technology &amp;#124; Business in Vancouver|publisher=biv.com|accessdate=2015-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thelondoner"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelondoner.ca/2015/01/09/the-html500-makes-london-stop-in-february|title=The HTML500 makes London stop in February &amp;#124; Londoner|author=nurun.com|publisher=thelondoner.ca|accessdate=2015-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lighthouse Labs acts as the official sponsor and parent company of the conferences. In an interview with [[BetaKit]], Shaki said of the educational initiative, "It’s about more people in Canada understanding the value of digital literacy.

In 2014, the event expanded to three additional Canadian cities: [[Calgary]], [[Toronto]], and [[London, Ontario|London]].

The second annual event in [[Vancouver]] had over 2500 applicants, of which the official 500 were selected through a lottery process.&lt;ref name="globalnews"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalnews.ca/news/1791427/html500-teaches-basics-of-coding-opens-doors-to-b-c-s-tech-sector/|title=HTML500 teaches basics of coding, opens doors to B.C.&amp;#8217;s tech sector - BC &amp;#124; Globalnews.ca|publisher=globalnews.ca|accessdate=2015-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over half of the attendees were women.&lt;ref name="vancouversun"/&gt; Beginning with the second Vancouver event, the Vancouver Economic Commission began running a career fair in tandem with the day's activities to further provide career resources to aspiring [[web developer]]s.&lt;ref name="cbc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/html500-coding-class-prepares-calgarians-for-booming-tech-sector-1.2939763|title=HTML500 coding class prepares Calgarians for booming tech sector - Calgary - CBC News|publisher=cbc.ca|accessdate=2015-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The multi-city events are routinely covered on the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] television network.&lt;ref name="cbc"/&gt;

== Event activities ==

Each event is designed to host 500 attendees. In each city, 50 local technology companies are chosen to help participate by managing and providing teaching assistance at one of the event's 50 attendee roundtables. All the partners and local community members who participate in the event donate their time voluntarily, as the event is a [[not-for-profit]], and there is no entry charge.&lt;ref name="betakit"/&gt;

Each event begins with a keynote speech plus an educational crash course taught by a notable member of the Canadian technology industry. Attendees are then provided with reference materials to assist them in the second phase of the schedule: building a website from scratch.&lt;ref name="globalnews"/&gt; By the end of the seven-hour schedule, it is the conference's goal to have removed the attendees' intimidation associated with programming, and to give them the confidence and resources needed to continue their [[web development]] learning if they choose to do so.&lt;ref name="thelondoner"/&gt;

'''The Qube''', previously known as the '''Chase Tower''', the '''Bank One Center''', and the '''National Bank of Detroit Building''', is a [[high-rise]] [[office building]] and [[Quicken Loans]] operations center in the U.S. designated [[Detroit Financial District]] at 611 [[M-1 (Michigan highway)|Woodward Avenue]], in [[Downtown Detroit|Downtown]] [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]. It was built in 1959 and stands at 14 floors in height and was completely remodeled in 2011. It was designed in the [[Modern architecture|modern architectural style]], and uses a great deal of [[marble]] to coordinate with the buildings in the nearby Civic Center. It was designed by [[Albert Kahn Associates]].

==History==
[[File:ChaseBuildingDetroit.JPG|thumb|left|220px|The Qube (white low rise) from [[Campus Martius Park]]]] 
[[File:150828-N-CI175-009 Navy Band Great Lakes perform at downtown Detroit.JPG|thumb|left|220px|A naval band performing outside the Qube in August 2015.]]
The Qube stands on the site of Detroit's first skyscraper, the [[Hammond Building]]. The ground floor of this building is a massive 1.5-story glass sheathed, [[banking]] hall. The building was known as 'Chase Tower' from 2006 to 2011 to reflect [[Chase Bank]]'s buyout of [[Bank One]]. In March 2007, the Sterling Group purchased the tower from JP Morgan Chase. Occupancy was approximately 50 percent at the time of sale. The building has had 3 official names now, for each of the 3 successive banks that have owned it: National Bank of Detroit (NBD), succeeded by Bank One, and lastly Chase.
The building has gone by several names in the past, most notably: Bank One Center, [[National Bank of Detroit]] Building, Bank One Building and Chase Tower.&lt;ref name="Qube"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.emporis.com/application/?nav=building&amp;lng=3&amp;id=118534| title=The Qube| publisher=[[Emporis]]| accessdate=May 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, [[Quicken Loans]] bought the building, renamed it the Qube and relocated 4,000 of the company's employees to the facility. The company plans to fill remaining space with retail.&lt;ref name=chase&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.mlive.com/business/detroit/index.ssf/2011/04/quicken_loans_closes_on_deal_t.html| title=Quicken Loans closes on deal to buy Chase Tower, parking garage in Downtown Detroit| agency=[[Associated Press]]| date=7 April 2011| work=[[Booth Newspapers|MLive]]| accessdate=2014-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2014, the Detroit bureau of [[Southfield, Michigan|Southfield]]-based [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] affiliate [[WXYZ-TV]] moved into the Qube after spending several decades across from the headquarters of the [[Detroit Police Department]]; its new location now includes satellite studio and newsroom facilities.

==Location==
The building is located on the block bordered by [[Woodward Avenue]] to the east, with the [[First National Building]] across Woodward. [[M-85 (Michigan highway)|West Fort Street]] borders the building on the north, with [[Cadillac Square]] and [[1001 Woodward]] across the street. [[Griswold Street]] borders the building to the west, with the [[Penobscot Block]] and [[Chrysler House]] across the street. [[West Congress Street]] borders the building to the south, with the [[Guardian Building]] across the street. Across Woodward Ave. from the Guardian Building lies [[Ally Detroit Center]], and the [[Buhl Building]] lies across Griswold Street, to the west. The building has a similar shape and size to the [[411 Building]], owned by competitor [[Comerica]].
