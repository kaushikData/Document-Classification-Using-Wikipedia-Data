The '''A19''' is a major [[road]] in [[England]] running approximately parallel to and east of the [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1 road]], although the two roads meet at the northern end of the A19, the two roads originally met at the southern end of the A19 in Doncaster but the old route of the A1 was changed to the A638. From Sunderland northwards, the route was formerly the A108. In the past the route was known as the East of Snaith-York-Thirsk-Stockton-on-Tees-Sunderland Trunk Road. Most traffic joins the A19, heading for [[Teesside]], from the [[A168 road|A168]] at [[Dishforth]] Interchange.

==Route==
{{Essay-like|section|date=August 2009}}

===Doncaster-Selby===
The southern end of the A19 starts at the ''St Mary's Roundabout'' with the [[A630 road|A630]] ''Church Way'' and A638 just to the north of Doncaster itself near to the parish church; this junction has been improved in recent years. It leaves the A638 at the next roundabout as ''Bentley Road'', and then winds its way over the [[East Coast Main Line]], which it follows through Selby and York, through the suburb of Bentley passing the [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] ''Bentley Service Station'',  St Peter's [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/178097 church] and the ''[https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/287294 Druid's Arms]'' and out into the countryside to the north of the urban area. It then passes the [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/287268 Pavilion] exhibition centre.

Much of the course of the southern section of the A19 runs through the old [[Yorkshire]] [[coalfield]], with evidence of old slag-heaps and colliery buildings. It passes through [[Toll Bar]] and the [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/287263 primary school]. It passes through [[Askern]], a former mining village. It meets the B1220 for [[Carcroft]] and goes through [[Owston, South Yorkshire|Owston]], passing the ''Owston Park Lodge''. Here it passes the ''Askern Hotel'', ''Red Lion Hotel'' and ''Askern Service Station'' and goes over a [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/234867 level crossing]. There is also a [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/89808 boating lake], St Peter's [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/234701 church] and a [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/89791 greyhound stadium]. There is a left turn for [[Norton, Doncaster|Norton]]. There are some long straights north of here, and the surrounds are mostly flat as the road heads towards the [[M62 motorway|M62]]. It enters [[North Yorkshire]] and the district of [[Selby (district)|Selby]] where it crosses the [[River Went]] near Walden Stubbs. There are some [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/280185 crossroads] at Balne Moor, and it passes through Whitley Thorpe and [[Whitley, North Yorkshire|Whitley]] and the ''[https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/246726 George &amp; Dragon]''. It meets the M62 at junction 34.

[[File:Eggborough Power Station at Sunset - geograph.org.uk - 1237134.jpg|thumb|140px|left|Eggborough power station]]
From the M62, the village of [[Eggborough]] has been bypassed in recent years, with the new road travelling from this roundabout to near the power station to the right (there are three power stations in a row at this point, running west-east: [[Ferrybridge power station|Ferrybridge]], [[Eggborough Power Station|Eggborough]], and [[Drax, North Yorkshire|Drax]], with its enormous chimney, to the east). Close by is [[Whitley Bridge]] and the A19 then meets the A645 at a roundabout and its previous alignment to the north of the village, before travelling through [[Chapel Haddlesey]] where it crosses the [[River Aire]] and the small village of [[Burn, North Yorkshire|Burn]], west of the former [[RAF Burn]], where it [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/753813 crosses] the [[Selby Canal]], then before [[Brayton, North Yorkshire|Brayton]], it joins the A63. The £44m six mile A63 Selby bypass, to the south of the town opened on 11 June 2004. Before this happened, all the traffic, headed straight towards the centre of Selby, over a level-crossing and on to a busy traffic-light junction with the [[A63 road|A63]] from [[Leeds]]. The A19 took the major of the concurrency&lt;!--what does this mean?--&gt; through the town centre, whilst crossing the old [[toll bridge]] and heading on north towards [[York]]. The road is still the A19 through Selby, but the bypass is the A63. However, north-bound traffic follows the A63.

===Selby-Thirsk===
[[File:A19 Barlby Osgodby 2.JPG|thumb|140px|right|Barlby Junction with the [[A63 road|A63]] on the former [[East Coast Main Line]] north of Selby]]
The £5m {{convert|5|mi|adj=on}} Riccall and Barlby bypass opened in October 1987. This provided better junctions with the A63 ([[Howden]]) and A163 ([[Holme-on-Spalding-Moor]]). The A63 and A19 meet at a roundabout near a large [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/159628 pickle factory]. It heads [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/343442 towards] [[Riccall]] where the road is much [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/877042 straighter] after the bypass; it is following what was the East Coast Main Line before the [[Selby Diversion]] was built. Where the road leaves the old railway, the [[Trans Pennine Trail]] follows along the old track. At [[Escrick]], it enters the Vale of York, and passes the [[BP]] ''York Road Garage'', the Parsonage Hotel and the [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/77137 church] of [[Helena (Empress)|St Helen]]. Next is [[Deighton, York|Deighton]], passing the ''White Swan Inn'', then it heads [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/295057 towards] [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/295033 Crockey Hill]. It [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/278193 meets] the A64 near the [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/278190 headquarters] of [[Persimmon plc]].

[[File:Dawnay Arms - geograph.org.uk - 903636.jpg|thumb|140px|left|''[http://www.thedawnayarms.co.uk Dawnay Arms]'' in the unbypassed [[Shipton-by-Beningbrough]] ]]
The [[York Outer Ring Road|York Northern By-Pass]] as the A1237 is a substitute for the A19 through York – this road is poorly engineered and has frequent roundabouts. The A19 still goes through York, beginning with the ''Fulford Interchange'' with the [[A64 road|A64]] close to a shopping centre, then [[Fulford]], meeting the B1222 and passing St Oswald's [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/77129 church]. It crosses the East Coast Main Line and passes through [[Clifton, City of York|Clifton]] and [[Rawcliffe, York|Rawcliffe]]. North of York, the road passes the ''Riverside Farm'' pub, then goes through [[Skelton, York|Skelton]] as ''Shipton Road'' passing the ''Blacksmith's Arms'' and ''Ramada York Hotel''. It [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/265261 re-enters] North Yorkshire and the district of [[Hambleton District|Hambleton]] and goes straight [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/265258 through] the middle of [[Shipton, North Yorkshire|Shipton by Beningbrough]] as ''Main Street'', to the annoyance of many residents. It passes the ''Sidings Hotel'', ''Dawnay Arms'' and the Holy Evangelists [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/11568 church]. Leaving the village it passes a [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/257511 garage] on the left; on 25 July 2004 [[Mark Hobson]] was caught by the police here.

[[File:Lay by on A19 south near Thirsk. - geograph.org.uk - 832328.jpg|thumb|140px|right|[[Thirsk]] bypass]]
There is a left turn for [[Tollerton, North Yorkshire|Tollerton]] and goes [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/263839 through] Tollerton Forest. Heading northward the section between York and [[Thirsk]] was not helped much by the opening of the £5m {{convert|3|mi|adj=on}} [[Easingwold]] [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/886090 Bypass] in November 1994, as the road remained single carriageway, starting at a [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/263853 roundabout]. There is a left turn for [[Raskelf]]. The residents of [[Thormanby]] look forward to their village being bypassed. Here it passes the ''Black Bull'' pub. There is the small dwelling of [https://web.archive.org/web/20041225192146/http://www.hambleton.gov.uk/hambleton/parish.nsf/par/all/birdforth?opendocument Birdforth] with a roadside [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/320757 cafe] and crossroads for [[Hutton Sessay]] and [[Carlton Husthwaite]]. It [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/416358 crosses] the Thirkleby Beck near [[Great Thirkleby]] and goes across [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/444703 Pudding Pie Hill]. It meets the A168 from the south, and the old route through Thirsk is now the A170 then the [[A61 road|A61]]. The [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/854733 bypass] meets the A61 and A168 (for Northallerton) at a junction near [[South Kilvington]].

===Thirsk-Billingham===
[[File:A19 Bridge Over the River Leven - geograph.org.uk - 145627.jpg|thumb|left|Leven Viaduct]]
North of Thirsk, the A19 takes over from the A168 as the link from the A1 to [[Teesside]] and becomes a fast [[dual carriageway]] with mostly grade separated [[Interchange (road)|interchanges]]. The five-mile £4.4 million Thirsk By-pass was opened on 5 September 1972 by [[Robin Turton, Baron Tranmire]], the local MP (from 1929), with a flypast by four [[Royal Air Force]] [[Vickers Varsity]] aircraft - [[RAF Topcliffe]] is to the south-west of Thirsk. It passes [[North Kilvington]], and the £0.3 million South of Knayton (at Swan Lane) to north of Thirsk Bypass section opened in the early 1970s. It climbs slightly past the junction at [[Knayton]] near [[Borrowby, Hambleton|Borrowby]] and skirting the western edge of the [[North York Moors]], meeting the A684 (for [[Northallerton]]) a Clack Lane End after [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/403314 passing] through [[Leake, North Yorkshire|Leake]] and by the ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20141210201216/http://www.thehaynesarms.com/ Haynes Arms]''. The Borrowby Diversion opened in the late 1960s. The £1.1 million South of Clack Lane End to north end of Borrowby Diversion opened in the early 1970s. The Cleveland Tontine to Clack Lane End improvement opened in the early 1970s. It drops towards the [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/66791 Cleveland Tontine] at the junction with the A172 (for [[Stokesley]] and [[Guisborough]]). {{convert|1|mi}} later, it passes the BP ''Exelby Services'' on both sides of the road. Eventually after passing the [[Crathorne, North Yorkshire|Crathorne]]/[[Yarm]] exit the road passes over the [[River Leven, North Yorkshire|Leven]] Viaduct towards Teesside. From the Crathorne bypass, the road leaves the old route to the east, with the old route now being the A67 then the A135 through Stockton. About {{convert|2|mi}} from the Parkway Turn (A174) in [[Middlesbrough]] the road is raised slightly, overlooking [[Thornaby]] Industrial Estate and one of Europe's biggest housing estates known as [[Ingleby Barwick]], giving clues that Teesside is imminent.

[[File:A19 Tees Viaduct rom Maze Park viewing hill-2-1088.jpg|thumb|Tees Viaduct looking east towards Middlesbrough]]
At the Parkway the lighting columns appear then the road widens to three lanes, then at [[Acklam, Middlesbrough|Acklam]] at the A1130 interchange it becomes four before two peel off for the [[A66 road|A66]] for [[Stockton-on-Tees]] and Middlesbrough. The Tees Bridge opened in 1975. Either side of the River Tees crossing, the [[Tees Viaduct]], is a retail park - [[Teesside Park]] with a [[Morrisons]] to the south of the river and [[Portrack]] with an [[Asda]] on the Stockton side, with a mass of industry in the vicinity of the A66/A19 interchange. This interchange is one of the few 4-way [[free-flow interchange]]s in Britain not found on the motorway network, and is similar to a four-level [[stack interchange]], but with a single loop ramp covering the A19 south to A66 west movement.  This road was improved in 1998 by widening from 2 to 3 &amp; 4 lanes each way the {{convert|4|mi|adj=on}} section between the Parkway and [[Norton, County Durham|Norton]]. Even in [[rush hour]] the road still flows quite well. The grade-separated {{convert|4|mi|adj=on}} £19m [[Billingham]] Diversion was officially opened in February 1983, which diverted the traffic through a sub-standard section with roundabouts ([[Wolviston]] By-pass) built in the late 1960s.

===Billingham-Seaton Burn===
[[File:The old A19 dual carriageway leaves the new A19 - geograph.org.uk - 407666.jpg|thumb|140px|left|Billingham Diversion meets the former route (now a spur to the [[A689 road|A689]] for Hartlepool) at [[Elwick, County Durham|Elwick]]]] 
Past Teesside the A19 enters rural landscape, meeting the former route through Billingham, where it enters the borough of Hartlepool. There is a right turn for [[Dalton Piercy]] at the Windmill Motel, and two link roads into [[Elwick, County Durham|Elwick]], to the east. At [[Sheraton with Hulam]], there is an intersection for the B1280 (for [[Wingate, County Durham|Wingate]] to the west), and the [[A179 road|A179]] (for Hartlepool, to the east). At this intersection the road enters [[County Durham]]. The route over Sedgewick Hill has been improved to the east. There is staggered crossroads, for [[Hutton Henry]], to the left. There used to be a right turn for [[Castle Eden]], now accessible only from the southbound carriageway. North of here, the Castle Eden Diversion opened in the early 1970s. It crosses a former railway (now [[National Cycle Network|NCN]] [[National Cycle Route 1|1]] and [[National Cycle Route 14|14]]), and meets the A181 (for [[Wheatley Hill]] and [[Durham, England|Durham]]), and the B1281 (for [[Hesleden]]) at an intersection, and passes west of [[Old Shotton|Shotton]], where it joins the former route. There is a large intersection at ''Burnhope Way Roundabout'' for [[Shotton Colliery]] and a large industrial estate, to the west, and the B1320 for the [[new town]] of [[Peterlee]], to the east.
A [[overpass|flyover]] was constructed in the early 1990s to replace the previous roundabout, known locally as the Turnpike.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uklaws.org/statutory/instruments_00/doc00470.htm Roundabout improvement]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:South-bound Boxing Day traffic on the A19 near Hylton Castle - geograph.org.uk - 1633443.jpg|thumb|140px|right|Near [[Hylton Castle]] ]]
The 3.5-mile Easington and Cold Hesledon Diversion opened in the early 1970s, initially designated as the A19(M). There is an access road to the south from [[Easington, County Durham|Easington]] and the [[A1086 road|A1086]] (for Peterlee and Hartlepool) has limited access to the northbound and from the southbound routes. There is an intersection for the [[A182 road|A182]] (for [[Hetton-le-Hole]]), and limited access from the B1283 (for Easington Village), with no access from the southbound route. The former route north of Easington is the B1432 (to the east). At [[Cold Hesledon]], there is an intersection for the A182 (to [[Seaham]], to the east) and the B1285 (for [[Murton, County Durham|Murton]], to the west). The three-mile New Seaham and Seaton Diversion opened in the early 1970s, with the former route now the B1285 through [[Dalton-le-Dale]]. The eight miles of sections from Easington to Seaham were built by A. R. Carmichael in late 1971, and made the A19 from Thirsk to Sunderland completely dual-carriageway, with the contract awarded in October 1969. At [[Seaton with Slingley]], there is a limited-access (to and from the south) intersection for the [[A1018 road|A1018]], for Sunderland and [[Ryhope]]. At the same point there is a limited-access intersection (to and from the north) for the B1404 for [[Seaton, County Durham|Seaton]] and [[Houghton-le-Spring]]. The former route through the south of Sunderland is now the B1522. At the point where a former railway crosses (now NCN Route 1) the road enters the [[City of Sunderland]].

[[File:River Wear 20070702 Hylton Viaduct 01.jpg|thumb|140px|left|Hylton Bridge]]
At this point, the A19 makes a large deviation from its former route, by bypassing Sunderland from the west. Its former route went near the coast. The 8.75-mile Sunderland Bypass opened as the [[A roads in Zone 1 of the Great Britain numbering scheme|A108]], and was built by W.C. French, with fourteen bridges and five underpasses, with the contract awarded in February 1970. The A108 was also previously the number of an A road in north London, for a re-routed [[A10 road (England)|A10]] to [[Hoddesdon]]. At [[Herrington]] the A19 meets the A690 (for Houghton-le-Spring) and the B1286 at an interchange. It is crossed by the B1286. At [[Offerton, Tyne and Wear|Offerton]] and [[Hastings Hill]] there is an interchange with the [[A183 road (England)|A183 road]] (for [[Penshaw]] and [[Pennywell]]). The road crosses the [[River Wear]] on the [[Hylton Viaduct|Hylton Bridge]], which was built as the A108 in 1975 by W.C. French (Construction) Ltd. At [[North Hylton]], there is an interchange with the [[A1231 road|A1231]] (for [[Washington, Tyne and Wear|Washington]] and [[Castletown, Sunderland|Castletown]]). It passes the [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]] [[Nissan Motor Manufacturing (UK) Ltd|Nissan plant]] on the left, formerly the site of the [[Battle of Britain]] airfield, [[RAF Usworth]]. It meets the A1290, for Washington, at an interchange, where the road enters the borough of [[South Tyneside]] and is crossed by the [[Great North Forest Trail]].

[[File:Tyne Tunnel - Southern Entrance - geograph.org.uk - 324288.jpg|thumb|140px|right|Southern entrance of the [[Tyne Tunnel]] ]]
At Testo's Roundabout with the A184 (for [[Gateshead]] and [[The Boldons]]), the A19 originally ended as the A1 took over to run through the Tyne Tunnel, before that classification became assigned to the Newcastle Western Bypass from the [[Angel of the North]] to [[Kingston Park]]. To the east the A19 now approaches the [[Tyne Tunnel]], where a second tunnel has recently been completed to relieve traffic congestion. There is a limited access junction (from the north) for [[Hedworth]], and the road is crossed by the Green Line of the [[Tyne and Wear Metro]]. It meets the [[A194 road|A194]] (for [[South Shields]]) at an interchange. At the Jarrow Interchange, there is a roundabout for the A185 (for Hebburn) and the B1297 at the start of the single-carriageway £13m Tyne Tunnel, opened in October 1967 as the A108. The former route north of Sunderland is now the A1018.

The A19 continues in a north-westerly direction through North Tyneside past [[Killingworth]] and [[Cramlington]], rejoining the current A1, just north of Newcastle at [[Seaton Burn]].

Between Testo's Roundabout and Seaton Burn, the A19 was designated as part of the [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1]] until the opening of the Newcastle Western Bypass.

==Incidents==
In November 1986 a tanker loaded with [[toluene]] overturned and caught fire near [[Brookfield, Middlesbrough|Brookfield]]. The driver and the occupants of three cars were injured. The fire burned for eight hours and led to residents being warned  by [[Cleveland Police]] of potentially toxic fumes. The fire service later criticised the police response as a "massive overreaction".&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.commercialmotor.com/article/29th-november-1986/6/flaming-tanker-sparks-fresh-row Flaming tanker sparks fresh row]&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2008 a fuel tanker began leaking oil from its engine covering a mile-long stetch, including  bend, before stopping near [[Hartlepool]]. A small fire broke out and cars began sliding, although none crashed. The fire service shut down the road to clean it.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hartlepoolmail.co.uk/news/a19-oil-spill-chaos-1-1028596 A19 oil spill chaos]&lt;/ref&gt;
==In popular culture==
The road also inspired the song "A19" by the North East band [[Maximo Park]].

'''Anatoly Babko''' (15 October 1905 in [[Anzhero-Sudzhensk|Sudzhenskoye]], Tomsk Governorate – 7 January 1968) was a famous [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] [[chemist]], specializing in analytical chemistry and in the chemistry of complex compounds.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.achem.univ.kiev.ua/conference/babko/babko_summary.htm&lt;/ref&gt; 

Babko was a student of Professor N. Tananaev, a Member of the Academy of Sciences of the Ukrainian Soviet Republic (since 1957), and an Honoured Science Worker of the [[Ukrainian SSR]] (after 1966). In 1939, he organized the research department at the Institute of General and Inorganic Chemistry of the Ukrainian SSR, and managed it until the end of his life. In 1943 he was appointed to a professorship, and in 1944 became the Head of the Department of Analytical Chemistry at the [[University of Kiev]].&lt;ref&gt;http://persons-info.com/persons/BABKO_Anatolii_Kirillovich/&lt;/ref&gt; 

Babko's main works are devoted to the physical chemistry of complex compounds and their use in analytical chemistry as well as photometric and fluorescence methods of analysis.&lt;ref&gt;http://dic.academic.ru/dic.nsf/bse/66491/%D0%91%D0%B0%D0%B1%D0%BA%D0%BE&lt;/ref&gt;

He published more than 450 scientific works and 9 books that have been translated into several languages.

Bibliographic coupling occurs when two works [[citation|reference]] a common third work in their [[Bibliography|bibliographies]]. It is an indication that a probability exists that the two works treat a related subject matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Martyn | first1 = J | year = 1964 | title = Bibliographic coupling | url = | journal = Journal of Documentation | volume = 20 | issue = 4| page = 236 | doi=10.1108/eb026352}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two documents are ''bibliographically coupled'' if they both ''cite'' one or more documents in common. The "coupling strength" of two given documents is higher the more citations to other documents they share. The figure to the right illustrates the concept of bibliographic coupling. In the figure, documents A and B both cite documents C, D and E. Thus, documents A and B have a bibliographic coupling strength of 3 - the number of elements in the intersection of their two reference lists.

Similarly, two authors are ''bibliographically coupled'' if the cumulative reference lists of their respective oeuvres each contain a reference to a common document, and their coupling strength also increases with the citations to other documents that their share. If the cumulative reference list of an author's oeuvre is determined as the [[multiset]] union of the documents that the author has co-authored, then the ''author bibliographic coupling strength'' of two authors (or more precisely, of their oeuvres) is defined as the size of the multiset intersection of their cumulative reference lists, however.&lt;ref name="DOI: 10.1002/asi.20910"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zhao | first1 = D. | last2 = Strotmann | first2 = A. | year = 2008 | title = Evolution of research activities and intellectual influences in information science 1996–2005: Introducing author bibliographic-coupling analysis | url = | journal = Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology | volume = 59 | issue = 13| pages = 2070–2086 | doi = 10.1002/asi.20910 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bibliographic coupling can be useful in a wide variety of fields, since it helps researchers find related research done in the past. On the other hand, two documents are '''[[Co-citation|co-cited]]''' if they are both independently ''cited by'' one or more documents.

==History==
The concept of '''bibliographic coupling''' was introduced by M. M. Kessler of [[MIT]] in a paper published in 1963,&lt;ref&gt;"Bibliographic coupling between scientific papers," ''American Documentation'' 24 (1963), pp. 123-131.&lt;/ref&gt; and has been embraced in the work of the information scientist [[Eugene Garfield]].&lt;ref&gt;See for example "Multiple Independent Discovery and Creativity in Science," ''Current Contents'', Nov. 3, 1980, pp. 5-10, reprinted in [http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/essays.html Essays of an Information Scientist], vol. 4 (1979-80), pp. 660-665.&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the earliest citation analysis methods for document similarity computation and some have questioned its usefulness, pointing out that two works may reference completely unrelated subject matter in the third. Furthermore, bibliographic coupling is a retrospective similarity measure,&lt;ref&gt;Garfield Eugene, 2001.[http://garfield.library.upenn.edu/papers/drexelbelvergriffith92001.pdf ''From Bibliographic Coupling to Co-Citation Analysis via Algorithmic Historio-Bibliography''] presented at Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA&lt;/ref&gt; meaning the information used to establish the similarity relationship between documents lies in the past and is static, i.e. bibliographic coupling strength cannot change over time, since outgoing citation counts are fixed.

The [[Co-citation|'''co-citation''' analysis]] approach introduced by Henry Small and published in 1973 addressed this shortcoming of bibliographic coupling by considering a document's incoming citations to assess similarity, a measure that can change over time. Additionally, the co-citation measure reflects the opinion of many authors and thus represents a better indicator of subject similarity.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Small, 1973. [http://polaris.gseis.ucla.edu/gleazer/296_readings/small.pdf "Co-citation in the scientific literature: A new measure of the relationship between two documents"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121202085010/http://polaris.gseis.ucla.edu/gleazer/296_readings/small.pdf |date=2012-12-02 }}. ''Journal of the American Society for Information Science'' (JASIS), volume 24(4), pp. 265-269. doi = 10.1002/asi.4630240406&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972 Robert Amsler published a paper&lt;ref&gt;Robert Amsler, Dec. 1972 [http://openlibrary.org/works/OL12801639W/Applications_of_citation-based_automatic_classification?v=2 "Applications of citation-based automatic classification"], Linguistics Research Center, University Texas at Austin, Technical Report 72-14.&lt;/ref&gt; describing a measure for determining subject similarity between two documents by fusing bibliographic coupling and co-citation analysis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webla.sourceforge.net/javadocs/pt/tumba/links/Amsler.html Class Amsler] written by Bruno Martins and developed by the XLDB group of the ''Department of Informatics'' of the ''Faculty of Sciences of the University of Lisbon'' in Portugal&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981 Howard White and Belver Griffith introduced author co-citation analysis (ACA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = White | first1 = Howard D. | last2 = Griffith | first2 = Belver C. | year = 1981 | title = Author Cocitation: A Literature Measure of Intellectual Structure | url = | journal = Journal of the American Society for Information Science | volume = 32 | issue = 3| pages = 163–171 | doi = 10.1002/asi.4630320302 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Not until 2008 did Dangzhi Zhao and Andreas Strotmann combine their work and that of M. M. Kessler to define author bibliographic coupling analysis (ABCA), noting that as long as authors are active this metric is not static and that it is particularly useful when combined with ACA.&lt;ref name="DOI: 10.1002/asi.20910"/&gt;

More recently, in 2009, Gipp and Beel introduced a new approach termed [[Co-citation Proximity Analysis]] (CPA). CPA is based on the concept of co-citation, but represents a refinement to Small's measure in that CPA additionally considers the placement and proximity of citations within a document's full-text. The assumption is that citations in closer proximity are more likely to exhibit a stronger similarity relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Bela Gipp and Joeran Beel, 2009 [http://gipp.com/wp-content/papercite-data/pdf/gipp09a.pdf Citation Proximity Analysis (CPA) – ''A new approach for identifying related work based on Co-Citation Analysis''] in Proceedings of the 12th international conference on scientometrics and informetrics (issi’09), Rio de Janeiro (Brazil), 2009, pp. 571-575.&lt;/ref&gt;

In summary, a chronological overview of citation analysis methods includes: 
* Bibliographic coupling (1963) 
* Co-citation analysis (published 1973) 
* Amsler measure (1972)
* Author co-citation analysis (1981)
* Author bibliographic coupling analysis (2008)
* Co-citation proximity analysis (CPA) (2009)

==Applications==
Online sites that make use of bibliographic coupling include
[http://liinwww.ira.uka.de/bibliography/ The Collection of Computer Science Bibliographies] and [http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/cs CiteSeer.IST]

==Further reading==
For an interesting summary of the progression of the study of citations see.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Small | first1 = Henry | year = 2001 | title = Belver and Henry | doi = 10.1023/a:1019690918490 | journal = Scientometrics | volume = 51 | issue = 3| pages = 489–497 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper is more a memoir than a research paper, filled with decisions, research expectations, interests and motivations—including the story of how Henry Small approached Belver Griffith with the idea of co-citation and they became collaborators, mapping science as a whole.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1564">'''Capital strike''' refers to the withholding of new [[investment]] in an [[Economic system|economy]].  It arises from the determination that [[return on investment]] may be low or nonexistent.  

A capital strike can occur when banks decide to raise lending standards or minimum loan requirements to individuals and business entities, and decide to sit on cash reserves, rather than take many loan risks, until a later point in time. Capital strikes may sometimes result when [[governments]] pursue policies that investors consider "unfriendly" or "inflexible," such as [[rent control]] or [[nationalization]].   The term can refer to a capital strike by a single investor&lt;ref&gt;http://brophyworld.com/foreign-investor-explains-capital-strike-against-chile/&lt;/ref&gt; or a large group such as those who refused to invest in the United States in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.independent.org/blog/index.php?p=635&lt;/ref&gt;{{broken link|date=March 2017}} A capital strike is the premise of [[Ayn Rand]]'s novel ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]''.

In response, governments sometimes act to appease investors; however, governments committed to [[endogenous]] development (recently, in [[Latin America]]) occasionally refuse to capitulate and instead pursue [[economic development]] plans which utilize other resources.

A '''champagne flow''' is an [[astrophysical]] event whereby an [[HII region]] created inside a molecular cloud from [[ionization]] due to a recently formed star (usually an [[OB star|O-star]]) expands outward until it reaches the interstellar medium, at which point the ionized [[hydrogen]] [[gas]] bursts outward like an uncorked champagne bottle. This event is also sometimes called a [[Blister]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Franco|first1=Jose|last2=Ferrini|first2=Federico|last3=(Ed)|first3=G. TENORIO-TAGLE|title=Star Formation, Galaxies and the Interstellar Medium|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=9780521444125|page=241|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=4g9sT_xZp3gC&amp;pg=PA241|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The champagne model is perhaps one of the first [[numerical calculation]]s of the propagation of [[ionisation]] fronts and of the expansion of [[HII region]]s that 
did not assumed a constant density medium around the massive exciting [[star]]. The model assumes that 
[[star formation]] takes place in a dense cloud, surrounded and in pressure equilibrium with a low density inter-cloud gas.
The ample supply of [[UV photon]]s generated by the star rapidly establishes an HII region and the expansion of this, sooner or later 
allows also for the ionisation of the inter cloud gas. Ionisation disrupts then the former pressure balance between the 
cloud and the inter-cloud gas as under the stellar radiation field all photo-ionised gas acquires a temperature of the order of 10000 K.
In this way, the ionised cloud material acquires an excess pressure, a pressure larger than the ionised low density inter cloud gas and this 
provoques the supersonic expansion of the ionised cloud matter into the surrounding gas (the champagne flow). The streaming of matter out of the cloud allows 
for the ionisation of a larger portion of the original cloud susteining in this way the pressure imbalance which eventually leads to the complete disruption
of the parent cloud.   The terms champagne model and champagne flow were coined by [[Mexico|Mexican]] astrophysicist Guillermo Tenorio-Tagle in a paper in 1979 (Astronomy and Astrophysics 1979A&amp;A....71...59T).
The model focus on the  size, [[velocity field]] and the large density variations observed in HII regions.  This article was followed by further [[hydrodynamical]] 
calculations  in one and two dimensions, in collaboration with Drs. Peter Bodenheimer, Harold W. Yorke and Piet Bedijn see:1979ApJ...233…85B.1983A&amp;A...127..313Y,  1979A&amp;A....80..110T,  1982ASSL...93….1T,  1984A&amp;A...138..325Y,  1981A&amp;A....98…85B

In [[coding theory]], '''concatenated codes''' form a class of [[error-correcting code]]s that are derived by combining an '''inner code''' and an '''outer code'''. They were conceived in 1966 by [[Dave Forney]] as a solution to the problem of finding a code that has both exponentially decreasing error probability with increasing block length and [[polynomial-time]] decoding [[Computational complexity theory|complexity]].&lt;ref name="Forney"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Concatenated codes became widely used in space communications in the 1970s.

==Background==
The field of [[channel coding]] is concerned with sending a stream of data at the highest possible rate over a given [[communications channel]], and then decoding the original data reliably at the receiver, using encoding and decoding algorithms that are feasible to implement in a given technology.

[[Noisy-channel coding theorem|Shannon's channel coding theorem]] shows that over many common channels there exist channel coding schemes that are able to transmit data reliably at all rates &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; less than a certain threshold &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;, called the [[channel capacity]] of the given channel. In fact, the probability of decoding error can be made to decrease exponentially as the block length &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; of the coding scheme goes to infinity. However, the complexity of a naive optimum decoding scheme that simply computes the likelihood of every possible transmitted codeword increases exponentially with &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;, so such an optimum decoder rapidly becomes infeasible.

In his [http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?tid=5813&amp;ttype=2 doctoral thesis], [[Dave Forney]] showed that concatenated codes could be used to achieve exponentially decreasing error probabilities at all data rates less than capacity, with decoding complexity that increases only polynomially with the code block length.

==Description==
[[File:Concatenated codes diagram.png|thumb|upright=2|Schematic depiction of a concatenated code built upon an inner code and an outer code.]]
[[File:Concatenation of Reed–Solomon code with Hadamard code.svg|thumb|400px|This is a pictorial representation of a code concatenation, and, in particular, the [[Reed–Solomon code]] with n=q=4 and k=2 is used as the outer code and the [[Hadamard code]] with n=q and k=log q is used as the inner code. Overall, the concatenated code is a &lt;math&gt;[q^2,k \log q]&lt;/math&gt;-code.]]

Let ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''in''&lt;/sub&gt; be a [''n'', ''k'', ''d''] code, that is, a [[block code]] of length ''n'', [[dimension (vector space)|dimension]] ''k'', minimum [[Hamming distance]] ''d'', and [[code rate|rate]] ''r'' = ''k''/''n'', over an alphabet ''A'':
:&lt;math&gt;C_{in}: A^k \rightarrow A^n&lt;/math&gt;
Let ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''out''&lt;/sub&gt; be a [''N'', ''K'', ''D''] code over an alphabet ''B'' with |''B''| = |''A''|&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; symbols:
:&lt;math&gt;C_{out}: B^K \rightarrow B^N&lt;/math&gt;
The inner code ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''in''&lt;/sub&gt; takes one of |''A''|&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; = |''B''| possible inputs, encodes into an ''n''-tuple over ''A'', transmits, and decodes into one of |''B''| possible outputs.  We regard this as a (super) channel which can transmit one symbol from the alphabet ''B''. We use this channel ''N'' times to transmit each of the ''N'' symbols in a codeword of ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''out''&lt;/sub&gt;.  The ''concatenation'' of ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''out''&lt;/sub&gt; (as outer code) with ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''in''&lt;/sub&gt; (as inner code), denoted ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''out''&lt;/sub&gt;∘''C''&lt;sub&gt;''in''&lt;/sub&gt;, is thus a code of length ''Nn'' over the alphabet ''A'':&lt;ref name="Forney"/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;C_{out} \circ C_{in}: A^{kK} \rightarrow A^{nN}&lt;/math&gt;
It maps each input message ''m'' = (''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''m''&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt;) to a codeword (''C''&lt;sub&gt;''in''&lt;/sub&gt;(''m''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''in''&lt;/sub&gt;(''m''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), ..., ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''in''&lt;/sub&gt;(''m''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;)),
where (''m''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''m''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''m''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''out''&lt;/sub&gt;(''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''m''&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt;).

The ''key insight'' in this approach is that if ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''in''&lt;/sub&gt; is decoded using a [[maximum likelihood decoding|maximum-likelihood approach]] (thus showing an exponentially decreasing error probability with increasing length), and ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''out''&lt;/sub&gt; is a code with length ''N'' = 2&lt;sup&gt;''nr''&lt;/sup&gt; that can be decoded in polynomial time of ''N'', then the concatenated code can be decoded in polynomial time of its combined length ''n''2&lt;sup&gt;''nr''&lt;/sup&gt; = [[O notation|''O'']](''N''⋅log(''N'')) and shows an exponentially decreasing error probability, even if ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''in''&lt;/sub&gt; has exponential decoding complexity.&lt;ref name="Forney"/&gt; This is discussed in more detail in section [[#Decoding concatenated codes|Decoding concatenated codes]].

In a generalization of above concatenation, there are ''N'' possible inner codes ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''in'',''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and the ''i''-th symbol in a codeword of ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''out''&lt;/sub&gt; is transmitted across the inner channel using the ''i''-th inner code.  The [[Justesen code]]s are examples of generalized concatenated codes, where the outer code is a [[Reed–Solomon code]].

==Properties==
'''1.''' The distance of the concatenated code ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''out''&lt;/sub&gt;∘''C''&lt;sub&gt;''in''&lt;/sub&gt; is at least ''dD'', that is, it is a [''nN'', ''kK'', ''D''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;] code with ''D''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; ≥ ''dD''.

''Proof:''
Consider two different messages ''m''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; ≠ ''m''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ∈ ''B''&lt;sup&gt;''K''&lt;/sup&gt;. Let Δ denote the distance between two codewords. Then
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta(C_{out}(m^1), C_{out}(m^2)) \ge D.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, there are at least ''D'' positions in which the sequence of ''N'' symbols of the codewords ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''out''&lt;/sub&gt;(''m''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''out''&lt;/sub&gt;(''m''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) differ. For these positions, denoted ''i'', we have
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta(C_{in}(C_{out}(m^1)_i), C_{in}(C_{out}(m^2)_i)) \ge d.&lt;/math&gt;

Consequently, there are at least ''d''⋅''D'' positions in the sequence of ''n''⋅''N'' symbols taken from the alphabet ''A'' in which the two codewords differ, and hence
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta(C_{in}(C_{out}(m^1)), C_{in}(C_{out}(m^2))) \ge dD.&lt;/math&gt;

'''2.''' If ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''out''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''in''&lt;/sub&gt; are [[linear block code]]s, then ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''out''&lt;/sub&gt;∘''C''&lt;sub&gt;''in''&lt;/sub&gt; is also a linear block code.

This property can be easily shown based on the idea of defining a [[generator matrix]] for the concatenated code in terms of the generator matrices of ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''out''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''in''&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Decoding concatenated codes==

A natural concept for a decoding algorithm for concatenated codes is to first decode the inner code and then the outer code. For the algorithm to be practical it must be [[polynomial-time]] in the final block length. Consider that there is a polynomial-time unique decoding algorithm for the outer code. Now we have to find a polynomial-time decoding algorithm for the inner code. It is understood that polynomial running time here means that running time is polynomial in the final block length. The main idea is that if the inner block length is selected to be logarithmic in the size of the outer code then the decoding algorithm for the inner code may run in [[exponential time]] of the inner block length, and we can thus use an exponential-time but optimal [[Decoding methods#Maximum likelihood decoding|maximum likelihood decoder]] (MLD) for the inner code.

In detail, let the input to the decoder be the vector ''y'' = (''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;) ∈ (''A''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt;. Then the decoding algorithm is a two-step process:
# Use the MLD of the inner code ''C''&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt; to reconstruct a set of inner code words ''y''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; = (''y''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''y''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;), with ''y''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = MLD&lt;sub&gt;''C''&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;(''y''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;), 1 ≤ ''i'' ≤ ''N''.
# Run the unique decoding algorithm for ''C''&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt; on ''y''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;.

Now, the time complexity of the first step is [[O notation|''O'']](''N''⋅exp(''n'')), where ''n'' = ''O''(log(''N'')) is the inner block length. In other words, it is ''N''&lt;sup&gt;''O''(1)&lt;/sup&gt; (i.e., polynomial-time) in terms of the outer block length ''N''. As the outer decoding algorithm in step two is assumed to run in polynomial time the complexity of the overall decoding algorithm is polynomial-time as well.

===Remarks===

The decoding algorithm described above can be used to correct all errors up to less than ''dD''/4 in number. Using [[minimum distance decoding]], the outer decoder can correct all inputs ''y''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; with less than ''D''/2 symbols ''y''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; in error. Similarly, the inner code can reliably correct an input ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; if less than ''d''/2 inner symbols are erroneous. Thus, for an outer symbol ''y''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; to be incorrect after inner decoding at least ''d''/2 inner symbols must have been in error, and for the outer code to fail this must have happened for at least ''D''/2 outer symbols. Consequently, the total number of inner symbols that must be received incorrectly for the concatenated code to fail must be at least ''d''/2⋅''D''/2 = ''dD''/4.

The algorithm also works if the inner codes are different, e.g., for [[Justesen code]]s. The [[generalized minimum distance decoding|generalized minimum distance algorithm]], developed by Forney, can be used to correct up to ''dD''/2 errors.&lt;ref name="gmd"&gt;

==Applications==
Although a simple concatenation scheme was implemented already for the 1971 [[Mariner]] Mars orbiter mission,&lt;ref name="McEliece"/&gt; concatenated codes were starting to be regularly used for [[Deep Space Network|deep space]] communication with the [[Voyager program]], which launched two [[space probe]]s in 1977.&lt;ref name="deep-space-codes"&gt;K. Andrews et al., ''The Development of Turbo and LDPC Codes for Deep-Space Applications'', Proceedings of the IEEE, Vol. 95, No. 11, Nov. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, concatenated codes became the workhorse for efficient error correction coding, and stayed so at least until the invention of [[turbo codes]] and [[LDPC codes]].&lt;ref name="McEliece"/&gt;&lt;ref name="deep-space-codes"/&gt;

Typically, the inner code is not a block code but a [[soft-decision decoder|soft-decision]] [[convolutional code|convolutional]] [[Viterbi decoder|Viterbi-decoded]] code with a short constraint length.&lt;ref name="Odenwalder"&gt;
{{cite journal
|author=J. P. Odenwalder
|title=Optimal decoding of convolutional codes
|publisher=[[U.C.L.A.]], Systems Science Dept. ''(dissertation)''
|year=1970
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
For the outer code, a longer hard-decision block code, frequently a [[Reed-Solomon code]] with eight-bit symbols, is used.&lt;ref name="Forney"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McEliece"&gt;
{{cite journal
|author1=Robert J. McEliece

|author2=Laif Swanson
|title=Reed–Solomon Codes and the Exploration of the Solar System
|publisher=JPL
|date=20 August 1993
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
The larger symbol size makes the outer code more robust to [[error burst]]s that can occur due to channel impairments, and also because erroneous output of the convolutional code itself is bursty.&lt;ref name="Forney"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McEliece"/&gt; An [[forward error correction#Interleaving|interleaving layer]] is usually added between the two codes to spread error bursts across a wider range.&lt;ref name="McEliece"/&gt;

The combination of an inner Viterbi convolutional code with an outer [[Reed–Solomon code]] (known as an RSV code) was first used in ''[[Voyager 2]]'',&lt;ref name="McEliece"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. Ludwig, J. Taylor, [http://descanso.jpl.nasa.gov/DPSummary/Descanso4--Voyager_new.pdf Voyager Telecommunications Manual], [[JPL]] DESCANSO ''(Design and Performance Summary Series)'', March 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; and it became a popular construction both within and outside of the space sector. It is still notably used today for [[satellite communication]]s, such as the [[DVB-S]] [[digital television]] broadcast standard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/300400_300499/300421/01.01.02_60/en_300421v010102p.pdf Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB); Framing structure, channel coding and modulation for 11/12 GHz satellite services], [[ETSI]] EN 300 421, V1.1.2, August 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a looser sense, any (serial) combination of two or more codes may be referred to as a concatenated code. For example, within the [[DVB-S2]] standard, a highly efficient [[LDPC code]] is combined with an algebraic outer code in order to remove any resilient errors left over from the inner LDPC code due to its inherent [[error floor]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/302300_302399/302307/01.02.01_60/en_302307v010201p.pdf Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB); Second generation framing structure, channel coding and modulation systems for Broadcasting, Interactive Services, News Gathering and other broadband satellite applications (DVB-S2)], [[ETSI]] EN 302 307, V1.2.1, April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

A simple concatenation scheme is also used on the compact disc (CD), where an interleaving layer between two Reed–Solomon codes of different sizes spreads errors across various blocks.

== Turbo codes: A parallel concatenation approach ==
The description above is given for what is now called a serially concatenated code. [[Turbo code]]s, as described first in 1993, implemented a parallel concatenation of two convolutional codes, with an interleaver between the two codes and an iterative decoder that passes information forth and back between the codes.&lt;ref name="deep-space-codes"/&gt; This design has a better performance than any previously conceived concatenated codes.

However, a key aspect of turbo codes is their iterated decoding approach. Iterated decoding is now also applied to serial concatenations in order to achieve higher coding gains, such as within serially concatenated convolutional codes (SCCCs). An early form of iterated decoding was implemented with two to five iterations in the "Galileo code" of the [[Galileo (spacecraft)|Galileo space probe]].&lt;ref name="McEliece"/&gt;

'''''Cool It: The Skeptical Environmentalist's Guide to Global Warming''''' is a book by the Danish statistician and [[Political science|political scientist]] [[Bjørn Lomborg]].  The book is a sequel to ''[[The Skeptical Environmentalist]]'' (first published in Danish in 1998), which in English translation brought the author to world attention. Lomborg argues that many of the elaborate and expensive actions being considered to stop [[global warming]] will cost hundreds of billions of dollars without the same [[Rate of return|return on investment]], often are based on emotional rather than strictly scientific assumptions, and may have very little impact on the world's temperature for centuries. Lomborg concludes that a limited [[carbon tax]] is needed in the [[First World]] as well as subsidies from the [[First World]] to the [[Third World]] to help fight ongoing humanitarian crises.

==Reviews and critique==

In a review in ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Andrew Revkin]] says that Lomborg uses the book to reprise "his earlier argument with a tighter focus. He tries to puncture more of what he says are environmental myths, like the [[Polar bears#Conservation status.2C efforts and controversies|imminent demise of polar bears]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;blockquote&gt;[...] Bjorn Lomborg is like the [[Oliver Stone]] of climate change. He has written a book that sets out to support a certain point of view, and, unless you are an expert, you will never know which facts are correct and appropriately used and which are not. You might not be aware that large (and crucial) chunks of the story are skipped altogether. But like a Stone movie, it is a well-told tale and raises some questions that are worth thinking about. So if you are going to read only one book on climate, don’t read this one. But if you are going to read ten, reading Lomborg may be worthwhile.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===The Lomborg Deception===
In 2010, [[Howard Friel]] wrote ''[[The Lomborg Deception]]'', a book-length critique of ''Cool It'', which traces Lomborg’s many references and tests their authority and substance. Friel has said he found "misrepresentation of academic research, misquotation of data, reliance on studies irrelevant to the author’s claims and citation of sources that seem not to exist".&lt;ref&gt;Richard Girling. [http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/non-fiction/article7097185.ece The Lomborg Deception: Setting the Record Straight About Global Warming by Howard Friel], ''The Sunday Times'', April 18, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|Friel's conclusion, as per his book's title, is that Lomborg is "a performance artist disguised as an academic."
I don't want to be as trusting as the reviewers who praised Lomborg's scholarship without (it seems) bothering to check his references, so rather than taking Friel at his word just as they took Lomborg at his, I've done my best to do that checking. Although Friel engages in some bothersome overkill, overall his analysis is compelling.|||Sharon Begley|''[[Newsweek]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/233942 |title=Book Review: The Lomborg Deception: Debunking the claims of the climate-change skeptic |first=Sharon |last=Begley |publisher=Newsweek |date=22 February 2010 |accessdate=22 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Howard |last=Friel |authorlink=Howard Friel |title=The Lomborg Deception – Setting the Record Straight About Global Warming |publisher=Yale University Press |year=2010 |isbn=0-300-16103-4 |url=http://yalepress.yale.edu/Yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=9780300161038 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Lomborg, Friel's book appears to be aimed primarily at the popular version of ''Cool It'' as opposed to the longer more thoroughly cited edition.&lt;ref&gt;Bjorn Lomborg's response to Howard Friel. http://www.lomborg.com/sites/lomborg.com/files/bl_reply_to_howard_friel_0.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''electron microprobe''' (EMP), also known as an '''electron probe microanalyzer''' (EPMA) or '''electron micro probe analyzer''' (EMPA), is an analytical tool used to non-destructively determine the chemical composition of small volumes of solid materials. It works similarly to a [[scanning electron microscope]]: the sample is bombarded with an [[electron beam]], emitting x-rays at wavelengths characteristic to the elements being analyzed. This enables the abundances of elements present within small sample volumes (typically 10-30 cubic [[micrometers]] or less) to be determined.&lt;ref name="WittryPatent"&gt;Wittry, David B. (1958). "Electron Probe Microanalyzer", [https://www.google.com/patents?id=g7tMAAAAEBAJ&amp;d US Patent No 2916621], Washington, DC: U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.&lt;/ref&gt; The concentrations of elements from [[beryllium]] to [[plutonium]] can be measured at levels as low as 100 [[parts per million]] (ppm).  Recent models of EPMAs can accurately measure elemental concentrations of approximately 10 ppm.

== History ==
In 1944, MIT built an electron microprobe, combining an electron microscope and an energy loss spectrometer.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} [[Electron energy loss spectroscopy]] is very good for light element analysis and they obtained spectra of C-Kα, N-Kα and O-Kα radiation. In 1947, Hiller patented the idea of using an electron beam to produce analytical X-rays, but never constructed a working model. His design proposed using [[Bragg diffraction]] from a flat crystal to select specific X-ray wavelengths and a photographic plate as a detector.

In 1948-1950,  [[:fr:Raimond Castaing|Raymond Castaing]], supervised by [[André Guinier]], built the first electron “microsonde électronique” (electron microprobe) at [[Office national d'études et de recherches aérospatiales|ONERA]]. This microprobe produced an electron beam diameter of 1-3 μm with a beam current of ~10 nanoamperes (nA) and used a Geiger counter to detect the X-rays produced from the sample. However, the Geiger counter could not distinguish X-rays produced from specific elements and in 1950, Castaing added a [[quartz]] crystal between the sample and the detector to permit wavelength discrimination. He also added an optical microscope to view the point of beam impact. The resulting microprobe was described in Castaing's 1951 PhD Thesis,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis|last=Castaing |first=Raimond |type=PhD Thesis |title=Application des sondes électroniques à une méthode d'analyse ponctuelle chimique et cristallographique: publication ONERA ([[Office national d'études et de recherches aérospatiales|Office national d'études et de recherches aéronautiques]]/ Institute for Aeronautical Research) N. 55 |publisher=University of Paris |origyear=Submitted 1951 |publication-date=1952}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he laid the foundations of the theory and application of quantitative analysis by electron microprobe, establishing the theoretical framework for the matrix corrections of absorption and fluorescence effects. Castaing (1921-1999) is considered the "father" of electron microprobe analysis.

[[CAMECA]] (France) produced the first commercial microprobe, the “MS85,” in 1956.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} It was soon followed by many microprobes from other companies; however, all companies except [[CAMECA]] , [[JEOL]] and [[Shimadzu Corporation]] are now out of business. In addition, many researchers build electron microprobes in their labs. Significant subsequent improvements and modifications to microprobes included scanning the electron beam to make X-ray maps (1960), the addition of solid state EDS detectors (1968) and the development of synthetic multilayer diffracting crystals for analysis of light elements (1984). Later, [[CAMECA]] became also the pioneer on manufacturing a shielded version of the electron microprobe for [[nuclear reactor|nuclear]] applications. Several new advances in [[CAMECA]] instruments in the last decades allowed them to expand their range of applications on [[metallurgy]], [[electronics]], [[geology]], [[mineralogy]], [[nuclear plant]]s, [[trace element]]s, [[dentistry]], etc.

==How it works==
A beam of electrons is fired at a sample.  The beam causes each element in the sample to emit [[X-rays]] at a characteristic frequency; the X-rays can then be detected by the electron microprobe.&lt;ref name=Jansen1982&gt;{{Cite journal

===Detailed description===

Low-energy electrons are produced from a [[tungsten]] filament, a [[lanthanum hexaboride]] crystal cathode or a [[field emission]] electron source and accelerated by a positively biased [[anode]] plate to 3 to 30 thousand [[electron volts]] (keV). The anode plate has central aperture and electrons that pass through it are collimated and focused by a series of magnetic lenses and apertures. The resulting electron beam (approximately 5&amp;nbsp;nm to 10 μm diameter) may be rastered across the sample or used in spot mode to produce excitation of various effects in the sample. Among these effects are: [[phonon]] excitation (heat), [[cathodoluminescence]] (visible light fluorescence), continuum X-ray radiation ([[bremsstrahlung]]), characteristic X-ray radiation, secondary electrons ([[plasmon]] production), backscattered electron production, and [[Auger electron]] production.

When the beam electrons (and scattered electrons from the sample) interact with bound electrons in the innermost electron shells of the atoms of the various elements in the sample, they can scatter the bound electrons from the electron shell producing a vacancy in that shell (ionization of the atom). This vacancy is unstable and must be filled by an electron from either a higher energy bound shell in the atom (producing another vacancy which is in turn filled by electrons from yet higher energy bound shells) or by unbound electrons of low energy. The difference in binding energy between the electron shell in which the vacancy was produced and the shell from which the electron comes to fill the vacancy is emitted as a photon. The energy of the photon is in the X-ray region of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]. As the electron structure of each element is unique, the series X-ray line energies produced by vacancies in the innermost shells is characteristic of that element, although lines from different elements may overlap. As the innermost shells are involved, the X-ray line energies are generally not affected by chemical effects produced by bonding between elements in compounds except in low atomic number (Z) elements ( B, C, N, O and F for K&lt;sub&gt;alpha&lt;/sub&gt; and Al to Cl for K&lt;sub&gt;beta&lt;/sub&gt;) where line energies may be shifted as a result of the involvement of the electron shell from which vacancies are filled in chemical bonding.

The characteristic X-rays are used for chemical analysis. Specific X-ray wavelengths or energies are selected and counted, either by [[wavelength dispersive X-ray spectroscopy]] (WDS) or [[energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy]] (EDS). WDS utilizes [[Bragg diffraction]] from crystals to select X-ray wavelengths of interest and direct them to gas-flow or sealed proportional detectors. In contrast, EDS uses a solid state [[semiconductor detector]] to accumulate X-rays of all wavelengths produced from the sample.  While EDS yields more information and typically requires a much shorter counting time, WDS is generally a more precise technique with lower limits of detection because its superior X-ray peak resolution and greater peak to background ratio.

Chemical composition is determined by comparing the intensities of characteristic X-rays from the sample material with intensities from known composition (standards). Counts from the sample must be corrected for [[matrix effect]]s (depth of production of the X-rays,&lt;ref&gt;Duncumb P. and Reed S.J.B., NBS Spec. Publ. 298, Heinrich K.F.J. ed., 1968, p. 133 
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bishop H.E., 4th Int. Congr. X-Ray Opt., Orsay, Hermann, Paris, 1966, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] and secondary [[fluorescence]]&lt;ref&gt;S.J.B. Reed, Electron microprobe analysis, Cambridge University Press, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;K.F.J. Heinrich, and D.E. Newbury eds., Electron probe quantitation, Plenum Press, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;) to yield quantitative chemical compositions. The resulting chemical information is gathered in textural context. Variations in chemical composition within a material (zoning), such as a mineral grain or metal, can be readily determined.

Volume from which chemical information is gathered (volume of X-rays generation) is 0.3 – 3 cubic micrometers.

=== Limitations ===
* WDS is useful for higher atomic numbers, therefore WDS cannot determine elements below number 5 (boron). This limitation sets restrictions to WDS when analyzing geologically important elements such as H, Li, and Be.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://serc.carleton.edu/research_education/geochemsheets/wds.html|title=Wavelength-dispersive spectroscopy (WDS)|website=Geochemical Instrumentation and Analysis|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Despite the improved spectral resolution of elemental peaks, some peaks exhibit significant overlaps that result in analytical challenges (e.g., VKα and TiKβ). WDS analyses are not able to distinguish among the valence states of elements (e.g. Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; vs. Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;) such that this information must be obtained by other techniques (e.g. [[Mössbauer spectroscopy]] or [[Electron energy loss spectroscopy]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://serc.carleton.edu/research_education/geochemsheets/wds.html|title=Wavelength-dispersive spectroscopy (WDS)|website=Geochemical Instrumentation and Analysis|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The multiple masses of an element (i.e. isotopes) cannot be determined by WDS, but rather are most commonly obtained with a [[Mass spectrometry|mass spectrometer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://serc.carleton.edu/research_education/geochemsheets/wds.html|title=Wavelength-dispersive spectroscopy (WDS)|website=Geochemical Instrumentation and Analysis|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==

===Materials science and engineering===
[[Image:1886VE10-SEM-HD.jpg|thumb|A section of the 1886VE10 [[microcontroller]] [[Die (integrated circuit)|die]] as seen by an electron microprobe. The small bright cylinders are [[tungsten]] [[Via (electronics)|vias]] left over from a [[Metallizing|metalization]] [[Etching (microfabrication)|etching]] process. The [[X-ray spectroscopy]] technique can be used to determine the material composition of the vias.]]
[[Image:1886VE10-optical.jpg|thumb|For comparison purposes, a similar section of the 1886VE10 [[microcontroller]] [[Die (integrated circuit)|die]] as seen by an [[optical microscope]].]]

The technique is commonly used for analyzing the chemical composition of metals, alloys, ceramics, and glasses.  It is particularly useful for assessing the composition of individual particles or grains and chemical changes on the scale of a few micrometres to millimeters. The electron microprobe is widely used for research, quality control, and failure analysis.

===Mineralogy and petrology ===

This technique is most commonly used by mineralogists and petrologists.  Most rocks are aggregates of small mineral grains.  These grains may preserve chemical information adopted during their formation and subsequent alteration.  This information may illuminate geologic processes, such as crystallization, lithification, volcanism, metamorphism, orogenic events (mountain building), plate tectonics. This technique is also used for the study of extraterrestrial rocks (i.e. meteorites), and provides chemical data which is vital to understanding the evolution of the planets, asteroids, and comets.

The change in elemental composition from the center (also known as core) to the edge (or rim) of a mineral can yield information about the history of the crystal's formation, including the temperature, pressure, and chemistry of the surrounding medium. Quartz crystals, for example, incorporate a small, but measurable amount of titanium into their structure as a function of temperature, pressure, and the amount of titanium available in their environment.  Changes in these parameters are recorded by titanium as the crystal grows.

===Palaeontology===
In exceptionally preserved fossils, such as those of the [[Burgess shale]], soft parts of organisms may be preserved.  Since these fossils are often compressed into a 2D film, it can be difficult to deduce what features were what:  a famous example is that of triangular extensions in ''[[Opabinia]]'', which were interpreted as either legs or extensions of the gut.  Elemental mapping showed that they had a similar composition to the gut, favouring the second interpretation.&lt;ref name="ZhangBriggs2007"&gt;{{ cite journal

[[Image:Gilberts versorium needle electroscope.png|thumb|Gilbert's ''versorium''.]]

An  '''electroscope''' is a [[scientific instrument]] used to detect the presence and magnitude of [[electric charge]] on a body.  It was the first electrical [[measuring instrument]].   The first electroscope, a pivoted needle called the ''[[versorium]]'', was invented by British physician [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]] around 1600.&lt;ref name="Gilbert" &gt;{{cite book

Fleury Mottelay of William Gilbert (1600) ''Die Magnete'', London&lt;/ref&gt;   The '''pith-ball electroscope''' and the '''gold-leaf electroscope''' are two classical types of electroscope that are still used in physics education to demonstrate the principles of [[electrostatics]].  A type of electroscope is also used in the [[quartz fiber radiation dosimeter]]. Electroscopes were used by the Austrian scientist [[Victor Hess]] in the discovery of [[cosmic rays]].

Electroscopes detect electric charge by the motion of a test object due to the [[Coulomb's law|Coulomb electrostatic force]]. Since the [[electric potential]] or [[voltage]] of an object with respect to ground equals its charge divided by its [[capacitance]] to ground, an electroscope can be regarded as a crude [[voltmeter]]. However, the accumulation of enough charge to detect with an electroscope requires hundreds or thousands of [[volt]]s, so electroscopes are only used with high-voltage sources such as [[static electricity]] and [[electrostatic machine]]s.  Electroscopes generally give only a rough, qualitative indication of the magnitude of the charge. An instrument that measures charge [[quantitatively]] is called an [[electrometer]].

Modern electroscopes frequently use plastic balls and the ball is suspended by a [[silk]] thread from the hook of an [[Electrical insulation|insulated]] stand. In order to test the presence of a charge on an object, the object is brought near to the uncharged pith ball. If the object is charged, the ball will be attracted to it and move toward it.

The pith is a [[nonconductor]], so the [[electron]]s in the ball are bound to atoms of the pith and are not free to leave the atoms and move about in the ball, but they can move a little within the atoms. See diagram at right.  If, for example, a positively charged object ''(B)'' is brought near the pith ball ''(A)'', the negative [[electron]]s ''&lt;span style="color:blue;"&gt;(blue minus signs)&lt;/span&gt;'' in each atom ''(yellow ovals)'' will be attracted and move slightly toward the side of the atom nearer the object.  The positively charged [[Atomic nucleus|nuclei]] ''&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;(red plus signs)&lt;/span&gt;'' will be repelled and will move slightly away.  Since the negative charges in the pith ball are now nearer the object than the positive charges ''(C)'', their attraction is greater than the repulsion of the positive charges, resulting in a net attractive force.&lt;ref name="Kaplan" /&gt;  This separation of charge is microscopic, but since there are so many atoms, the tiny forces add up to a large enough force to move a light pith ball.

The pith ball can be charged by touching it to a charged object, so some of the charges on the surface of the charged object move to the surface of the ball.  Then the ball can be used to distinguish the polarity of charge on other objects because it will be repelled by objects charged with the same polarity or sign it has, but attracted to charges of the opposite polarity.

Often the electroscope will have a pair of suspended pith balls.  This allows one to tell at a glance whether the pith balls are charged. If one of the pith balls is touched to a charged object, charging it, the second one will be attracted and touch it, communicating some of the charge to the surface of the second ball.  Now both balls have the same polarity charge, so they repel each other.  They hang in an inverted 'V' shape with the balls spread apart.  The distance between the balls will give a rough idea of the magnitude of the charge.

== Gold-leaf electroscope ==
[[Image:Electroscope showing induction.png|thumb|right|250px|Gold leaf electroscope showing [[electrostatic induction]]]]
[[File:13. Електризација на електроскоп со инфлуенца.ogv|thumb|right|280px|Using an electroscope to show electrostatic induction. The device has leaves/needle the become charged when introducing a charged rod to it. The leaves bend the leave/needle, and the stronger the static introduced, the more bending occurs.]]
The gold-leaf electroscope was developed in 1787 by British clergyman and physicist [[Abraham Bennet]],&lt;ref name="Derry" /&gt; as a more sensitive instrument than  pith ball or [[straw]] blade electroscopes then in use.&lt;ref name="eb"&gt;[Anon.] (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of a vertical [[metal]] rod, usually [[brass]], from the end of which hang two parallel strips of thin flexible [[gold leaf]].  A disk or ball terminal is attached to the top of the rod, where the charge to be tested is applied.&lt;ref name="eb"/&gt; To protect the gold leaves from drafts of air they are enclosed in a glass bottle, usually open at the bottom and mounted over a [[Electrical conductor|conductive]] base. Often there are [[ground (electricity)|grounded]] metal plates or foil strips in the bottle flanking the gold leaves on either side.   These are a safety measure; if an excessive charge is applied to the delicate gold leaves, they will touch the grounding plates and discharge before tearing.  They also capture charge leaking through the air that  accumulate on the glass walls, and that increase the sensitivity of the instrument.  In the precision instruments the inside of the bottle was occasionally evacuated, to prevent the charge on the terminal from leaking off through the ionization of the air.

When the metal terminal is touched with a charged object, the gold leaves spread apart in a 'V'. This is because some of the charge on the object is conducted through the terminal and metal rod to the leaves.&lt;ref name="eb"/&gt; Since they receive the same sign charge they repel each other and thus diverge. If the terminal is [[Electrical ground|grounded]] by touching it with a [[finger]], the charge is transferred through the [[human body]] into the earth and the gold leaves close together.

The electroscope can also be charged without touching it to a charged object, by [[electrostatic induction]].  If a charged object is brought near the electroscope terminal, the leaves also diverge, because the [[electric field]] of the object causes charges in the electroscope rod to separate the leaves.  Charges of the opposite polarity to the charged object are attracted to the terminal, while charges with the same polarity are repelled to the leaves, causing them to spread.  If the electroscope terminal is grounded while the charged object is nearby, by touching it momentarily with a finger, the same polarity charges in the leaves drain away to ground, leaving the electroscope with a net charge of opposite polarity to the object.  The leaves close because the charge is all concentrated at the terminal end.  When the charged object is moved away, the charge at the terminal spreads into the leaves, causing them to spread apart again.

'''Frank Morton Carpenter''' (September 6, 1902 – January 18, 1994) received his PhD from [[Harvard University]], and was curator of [[fossil]] insects at the [[Museum of Comparative Zoology|Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology]] for 60 years.  He studied the [[Permian]] fossil insects of [[Elmo, Kansas]], and compared the North American fossil insect fauna with [[Paleozoic]] [[taxa]] known from elsewhere in the world.  A careful and methodical worker, he used venation and mouthparts to determine the relationships of fossil taxa, and was author of the ''[[Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology|Treatise]]'' volume on Insects.  He reduced the number of extinct insect orders then described from about fifty to nine.

Entomologists [[David Grimaldi (entomologist)|David Grimaldi]] and [[Michael S. Engel]] consider him "the most influential paleoentomologist of his generation" (Grimaldi and Engel 2005 p.&amp;nbsp;143).  He has been memorialized frequently with patronyms, including the [[Bittacidae|hanging fly]] ''[[Bittacus carpenteri]]'' Cheng, 1957,&lt;ref&gt;F. Y. Cheng. 1957. Revision of the Chinese Mecoptera.

'''Girolamo della Volpaia''' (ca. 1530-1614) was an Italian maker of [[clock]]s and [[scientific instruments]] from [[Volpaia]].

Girolamo continued the business of his father [[Camillo della Volpaia]] (1484-1560) and his uncles [[Benvenuto della Volpaia]] (1486-1532) and [[Eufrosino della Volpaia]] (late 15th century - 16th century), who were an important family of craftsmen in Tuscany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.mhs.ox.ac.uk/epact/catalogue.php | website=Epact | title=Armillary Sphere | publisher=Museum of the History of Science, Oxford | accessdate=27 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.volpaia.info/della_volpaia.htm | publisher=Volpaia | title=Volpaia - home of clockmakers | accessdate=27 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1554, he made an [[armillary sphere]], now preserved in the [[Science Museum, London|Science Museum]] in [[London]].&lt;ref name="smg"&gt;{{cite web|title=Italian armillary sphere, 1554|url=http://collection.sciencemuseum.org.uk/objects/co56284/italian-armillary-sphere-1554-armillary-sphere|publisher=Science Museum Group|accessdate=27 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1560, he succeeded his father as superintendent of the large clock in the [[Palazzo Vecchio]]. He also asked to be assigned the maintenance of his grandfather [[Lorenzo della Volpaia|Lorenzo]]'s (1446-1512) ''Orologio dei Pianeti'' [Planetary Clock], which he restored himself. In 1564, he designed a clock for the [[Piazza San Marco]] in [[Venice]]. In 1590, he built his last clock, preserved at the [[Museo Galileo]] of [[Florence]] (inv. 2460).

A '''hapaxanth''' is a [[plant]] species whose individuals [[flower]] only once in their lifetimes and die subsequently. Other terms with the same meaning are ''[[Reproduction#Other types of reproductive strategies|semelparous]]'' and ''[[monocarpic]]''. The term was first used by [[Alexander Braun]].

This term is used for plants that only have one flowering event and then die. It is used most often in conjunction with describing some of the [[taxa]] of [[Arecaceae]] (palms) and some species of [[bamboo]], but rarely used otherwise. Many [[annual plant|annuals]] flower over a period of time and can have flowers and seeds on the same plant at the same time, thus they are not hapaxanthic, because flowering does not lead to death. A related term is [[pleonanth]]ic, again used with Arecaceae (palms) and some bamboos for stems that flower more than once. Its antonym is often given as ''[[pollakanth]]'', although ''pleonanth'' is also seen.

The '''International Commission on Stratigraphy''' ('''ICS'''), sometimes referred to by the unofficial name "'''International Stratigraphic Commission'''" is a daughter or major [[subcommittee]] grade scientific daughter organization that concerns itself with [[stratigraphy]], [[geology|geological]], and [[chronology|geochronological]] matters on a global scale. 

It is a subordinate body of the [[International Union of Geological Sciences]]—of which it is the largest body within the organisation—and of which it is essentially a permanent [[working committee|working subcommittee]] that meets far more regularly than the quadrennial meetings scheduled by the IUGS, when it meets as a congress or [[committee|membership of the whole]].

==Aims==
{{Geology to Paleobiology|margin=0 0 1.3em 1.2em;}}
One of its main aims, a project begun in 1974, is to establish a multidisciplinary standard and global [[geologic time scale]] that will ease [[paleontology|paleontological]] and [[geobiology|geobiological]] comparisons region to region by benchmarks with stringent and rigorous strata criteria called [[Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point]]s (GSSPs) within the fossil record. (i.e. section of the [[geologic record|rock record]] as of a core sample section or accessible exposed strata, which when a core sample are usually "trayed" in long pieces, also called "sections" about a meter in length.)

==Methodology==
Additionally the ICS defines an alternative type of benchmark and criteria called [[Global Standard Stratigraphic Age]]s (GSSAs) where the characteristics and dating criteria set solely by [[physical sciences]] methods (such as magnetic alignment sequences, radiological criteria, etcetera.) as well as encouraging an international and open debate amongst [[earth sciences|Earth scientists]] in the [[paleontologists|paleontology]], [[geology]], [[geobiology]] and [[chronostratigraphy]] fields, among others.  

The International Commission on Stratigraphy has spawned numerous [[subcommittee]] level organizations organized and mobilized on a local country-wide or regional basis that are the true working committees of the IUGS, and these do the field work, basis comparisons in conference or co-ordination [[research committee]] meetings of local or wide-scale scope.

==Publications==
The ICS publishes various reports and findings as well as revised references periodically, summarized in the '''International Stratigraphic Chart''', a combined ''working proposal'' and ''guideline-to-date'' released after the last ICS deliberations prior to the upcoming (next) meeting of the IUGS. Until the IUGS accepts the recommendations, they are unofficial since the IUGS parent approves or dismisses the individual deliberation reports of the ICS, which are presented as recommendations, and span dating and strata selection criteria, and related issues including nomenclatures. In ''[[de facto]]'' everyday matters, the deliberative results reported out of any meetings of the ICS are widely accepted and immediately enter everyday use, except in the rare cases where they result in a strong body of dissenting opinion, which matters are resolved before the full IUGS.

One such controversy arose in 2009 when the ICS deliberated and decided that the [[Pliocene]] [[series (geology)|Series]] of the current but unofficially named [[Quaternary]] [[period (geology)|Period]] should be shifted into the [[Neogene]] [[system (geology)|System]] and Neogene Period.&lt;ref name="Riccardi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stratigraphy.org/upload/IUGS%20Ratification_Q%20&amp;%20Pleistocene.pdf|title=Ratification of the definition of the base of Quaternary System/Period (and top of the Neogene System/Period), and redefinition of the base of the Pleistocene Series/Epoch (and top of the Pliocene Series/Epoch)|last=Riccardi|first=A.C.|date=30 June 2009|publisher=[[International Union of Geological Sciences]]|accessdate=30 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term Quaternary has yet to be officially adopted by the IUGS, but has widespread support as acceptable nomenclature for the current geologic period beginning at the [[GSSP]] accepted at 5,332,000 years ago at the transition between the [[Messinian|Messinian Age]] to the [[Zanclean]] [[age (geology)|Age]] (3.6 mya). The ICS voted, perhaps because the time units span human paleo-archaeological strata, to begin the Quaternary at the end GSSP of the [[Piacenzian|Piacenzian Age]] (2.588 mya) or possibly the end of the [[Gelasian]] (1.806 mya), any of which are in a different [[epoch (geology)|epoch]].

==Logo==
The logo of International Commission on Stratigraphy was designed after the Chinese character of "mountain".

==NASA Office of Inspector General cases==
[[File:Gutheinz Omniplan photo - NASA.jpg|right|thumb|Joseph Gutheinz during the Omniplan Investigation]]
Gutheinz led the Omniplan task force investigation, which determined that Omniplan, a NASA contractor, was submitting false claims to NASA. The company had claimed it was leasing through three companies that were in fact shell companies controlled by Omniplan's owner Ralph Montijo. Gutheinz created the task force with 25 agents, inspectors, auditors and a financial analyst from eight agencies. The investigation led to the closure of 7 companies, making it one of the highest profile in NASA history at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/17/us/businessman-is-sentenced-for-bilking-space-agency.html|title=Businessman Is Sentenced For Bilking Space Agency|date=17 January 1996|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Grand Jury Indicts 7 in NASA Scam Case |first=Mark |last=Carreau |newspaper=Houston Chronicle |date=November 3, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=NASA Contractor Admits Multimillion-dollar Fraud: OMNI Contractor admits 179 counts of fraud and embezzlement |newspaper=Houston Post |date=February 1, 1995 |pages=1A &amp; 11A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gutheinz subsequently gave a speech to the International Business Forum about the Omniplan case, a speech attended by one of the principal defense attorneys in that case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Omniplan Owners Plead Guilty |first=Laura |last=Johnson |newspaper=The Citizen |date=February 3, 1995 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Omniplan Defrauded NASA Through Elaborate Scheme |first=C.R. |last=Cooper |newspaper=The Citizen |date=January 19, 2000 |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operation Lunar Eclipse===
Gutheinz led and went undercover in Operation Lunar Eclipse, a [[sting operation]] to recover the Honduras [[Apollo 17]] Goodwill Moon Rock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Apollo 17 Moon Rock Recovered: Plan to Sell Rock for $5m |author=Associated Press |date=December 8, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Moon rock business gets man date with feds |first=Liz |last=Gutierrez Henson |newspaper=The Citizen |location=Clear Lake, Texas |date=December 16, 1998 |pages=1 &amp; 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Judge Rules against Moon Rock Sends it Back to Honduras |first=Ted |last=Strevli |newspaper=[[Galveston Daily News]] |date=March 27, 2003 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Lost: the Hottest Rocks on Earth |first=Anjana |last=Ahuja |location=London, UK |newspaper=[[The Times]] |date=July 20, 2004 |pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Passion and Profit: Towards an anthropology of collecting |first=Paul |last=van der Grijp |location=Berlin |publisher=[[LIT Verlag]] |page=145 |year=2006 |isbn=978-3825892586}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Honduras Apollo 17 Goodwill Moon Rock had been offered to Gutheinz for 5 million dollars, and Texas billionaire [[H. Ross Perot]] put up the money which facilitated the moon rock's recovery. The three agencies in Operation Lunar Eclipse were [[NASA Office of Inspector General]] (SSA Joseph Gutheinz aka Tony Coriasso), the United States Postal Inspection Service (Inspector Bob Cregger aka John Marta) and United States Customs (SA David Attwood and SA Dwight Weikel). Operation Lunar Eclipse was designed to catch con-artists selling terrestrial rocks and dust and offering them as Apollo era moon rocks and lunar dust. Upon determining that the seller of the Honduras Apollo 17 Goodwill Moon Rock was selling a genuine Apollo era moon rock, Gutheinz investigated further and determined that there was a lack of accountability on all the Apollo 11 and 17 Moon Rocks and lunar dust that the Nixon, Ford and Carter Administrations gifted away to the states and nations of the world. Gutheinz had previously requested, in 1998-1999, that NASA OIG attempt to account for the gifted moon rocks and lunar dust. In December 2011 NASA OIG revealed the finding of an audit they conducted on loaned, not gifted, Apollo era lunar samples, which revealed a lack of accountability by both NASA and the recipient individuals and entities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Moon Rock Going Back to Owner |quote="Gutheinz a special agent from Clear Lake posed as (Tony) Coriasso" |first=Eric |last=Ervin |newspaper=Clear Lake Citizen |date=April 2, 2003 |page=9A}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://litigation-essentials.lexisnexis.com/webcd/app?action=DocumentDisplay&amp;crawlid=1&amp;doctype=cite&amp;docid=13+DePaul-LCA+J.+Art+%26+Ent.+L.+465&amp;srctype=smi&amp;srcid=3B15&amp;key=b169c4d984e7dbf6a3b0d32a1578f1bc |title=Case Summary: United States of America v.

===Canada's Apollo 17 Goodwill Moon Rock===

In 2002, Gutheinz first assigned his University of Phoenix students to track down Canada's Apollo 17 Moon Rock. Their efforts discerned that the moon rock and plaque were unaccounted for and believed stolen decades earlier. Gutheinz's students tracked down the moon rock to a storage facility at the Canadian Museum of Nature. In 2009 Gutheinz and his students pressured Canada and the Museum to place the Canadian Apollo 17 Goodwill Moon Rock on display for the 40th anniversary Apollo 11. The moon rock was transferred to the Canadian Science and Technology Museum and placed on display in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://windsorstar.com/travel/Canada+goodwill+moon+rock+going+back+display/1813881/story.html?id=1813881 |title=Canada's 'Goodwill Moon Rock' Going Back on Display |first=Cassandra |last=Drudi |newspaper=[[Windsor Star]] |date=July 21, 2009 |accessdate=November 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Moon Rocks in Storage: Ex NASA Officials Says Canada Should Display its Piece of History |first1=Pat |last1=Hewitt |first2=Amy |last2=Fuller |newspaper=[[The Chronicle Herald]] |date=July 21, 2009 |pages=B1 &amp; B2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Our Bit of the Moon Finally has Day in the Sun |first=Cassandra |last=Drudi |newspaper=[[Ottawa Citizen]] |date=July 22, 2009 |pages=C1 &amp; C2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="83498">'''Le Sage's theory of gravitation''' is a kinetic theory of [[gravity]] originally proposed by [[Nicolas Fatio de Duillier]] in 1690 and later by [[Georges-Louis Le Sage]] in 1748.  The theory proposed a mechanical explanation for Newton's gravitational force in terms of streams of tiny unseen particles (which Le Sage called ultra-mundane corpuscles) impacting all material objects from all directions. According to this model, any two material bodies partially shield each other from the impinging corpuscles, resulting in a net imbalance in the pressure exerted by the impact of corpuscles on the bodies, tending to drive the bodies together. This mechanical explanation for gravity never gained widespread acceptance, although it continued to be studied occasionally by physicists until the beginning of the 20th century, by which time it was generally considered to be conclusively discredited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Pushing Gravity: New Perspectives on Le Sage's Theory of Gravitation |edition=illustrated |first1=Matthew R. |last1=Edwards |publisher=Indiana University |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-9683689-7-8 |page=65 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ggoIAQAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Basic theory ==
[[Image:Pushing1.svg|left|thumb|150px|&lt;div class="center"&gt;P1: Single Body&lt;br /&gt;No net directional force&lt;/div&gt;]]The theory posits that the [[force]] of gravity is the result of tiny particles (corpuscles) moving at high speed in all directions, throughout the [[universe]]. The intensity of the flux of particles is assumed to be the same in all directions, so an isolated object A is struck equally from all sides, resulting in only an inward-directed [[pressure]] but no net directional force (P1).
[[Image:Pushing2.png|right|thumb|150px|&lt;div class="center"&gt;P2: Two bodies "attract" each other&lt;/div&gt;]]
With a second object ''B'' present, however, a fraction of the particles that would otherwise have struck A from the direction of B is intercepted, so B works as a shield, i.e. from the direction of B, A will be struck by fewer particles than from the opposite direction. Likewise B will be struck by fewer particles from the direction of A than from the opposite direction. One can say that A and B are "shadowing" each other, and the two bodies are pushed toward each other by the resulting imbalance of forces (P2). Thus the apparent attraction between bodies is, according to this theory, actually a diminished push from the direction of other bodies, so the theory is sometimes called ''push gravity'' or ''shadow gravity'', although it is more widely referred to as ''Lesage gravity''.

;Nature of collisions:&lt;!--if there are to be semicolons at the start of lines for bold then they must end in a colon or it breaks html for screen-readers see [[Help_talk:Wiki_markup#Semi.2Fcolon]]--&gt; 
[[Image:Pushing3.svg|left|thumb|150px|&lt;div class="center"&gt;P3: Opposite streams&lt;/div&gt;]]
If the collisions of body A and the gravific particles are fully [[Elastic collision|elastic]], the intensity of the reflected particles would be as strong as of the incoming ones, so no net directional force would arise. The same is true if a second body B is introduced, where B acts as a shield against gravific particles in the direction of A. The gravific particle C which ordinarily would strike on A is blocked by B, but another particle D which ordinarily would not have struck A, is re-directed by the reflection on B, and therefore replaces C. Thus if the collisions are fully elastic, the reflected particles between A and B would fully compensate any shadowing effect. In order to account for a net gravitational force, it must be assumed that the collisions are not fully elastic, or at least that the reflected particles are slowed, so that their momentum is reduced after the impact. This would result in streams with diminished momentum departing from A, and streams with undiminished momentum arriving at A, so a net directional momentum toward the center of A would arise (P3). Under this assumption, the reflected particles in the two-body case will not fully compensate the shadowing effect, because the reflected flux is weaker than the incident flux.

;Inverse square law:
[[Image:Pushing4.svg|right|thumb|150px|&lt;div class="center"&gt;P4: Inverse square relation&lt;/div&gt;]]
Since it is assumed that some or all of the gravific particles converging on an object are either absorbed or slowed by the object, it follows that the intensity of the flux of gravific particles emanating from the direction of a massive object is less than the flux converging on the object. We can imagine this imbalance of momentum flow - and therefore of the force exerted on any other body in the vicinity - distributed over a spherical surface centered on the object (P4). The imbalance of momentum flow over an entire spherical surface enclosing the object is independent of the size of the enclosing sphere, whereas the surface area of the sphere increases in proportion to the square of the radius. Therefore, the momentum imbalance per unit area decreases inversely as the square of the distance.

;Mass proportionality:
From the premises outlined so far, there arises only a force which is proportional to the surface of the bodies. But gravity is proportional to the masses. To satisfy the need for mass proportionality, the theory posits that a) the basic elements of matter are very small so that gross matter consists mostly of empty space, and b) that the particles are so small, that only a small fraction of them would be intercepted by gross matter. The result is, that the "shadow" of each body is proportional to the surface of every single element of matter. If it is then assumed that the elementary opaque elements of all matter are identical (i.e., having the same ratio of density to area), it will follow that the shadow effect is, at least approximately, proportional to the mass (P5).

[[Image:Fatio.jpg|thumb|right|150px|&lt;div class="center"&gt;[[Nicolas Fatio de Duillier|Nicolas Fatio]]&lt;/div&gt;]]
Nicolas Fatio presented the first formulation of his thoughts on gravitation in a letter to [[Christiaan Huygens]] in the spring of 1690.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Duillier |first=N. Fatio de |author-link=Nicolas Fatio de Duillier |year= 1690a |contribution=Lettre N° 2570 |contribution-url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k778578/f388.table |editor= Société Hollandaise des Sciences |title=Oeuvres complètes de Christiaan Huygens |volume=9 |place=The Hague |publication-date=1888–1950 |pages=381–389 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later Fatio read the content of the letter before the [[Royal Society]] in London. In the following years Fatio composed several draft [[manuscript]]s of his major work ''De la Cause de la Pesanteur'', but none of this material was published in his lifetime. In 1731 Fatio also sent his theory as a Latin poem, in the style of [[Lucretius]], to the Paris Academy of Science, but it was dismissed. Some [[literary fragment|fragments]] of these manuscripts and copies of the poem were later acquired by [[Georges-Louis Le Sage|Le Sage]] who failed to find a publisher for Fatio's papers.&lt;ref name=notice&gt;See secondary sources, Prévost (1805)&lt;/ref&gt; So it lasted until 1929,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Duillier |first=N.

Fatio de |author-link=Nicolas Fatio de Duillier |chapter=De la Cause de la Pesanteur |editor=Gagnebin, Bernard |title=De la Cause de la Pesanteur: Mémoire de Nicolas Fatio de Duillier |journal=Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=125–160 |year=1743 |publication-date=1949 |chapter-url=http://www.journals.royalsoc.ac.uk/link.asp?id=bn57l77831121738 |doi=10.1098/rsnr.1949.0018 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gagnebin used the collected fragments in possession of Le Sage to reconstruct the paper. The Gagnebin edition includes revisions made by Fatio as late as 1743, forty years after he composed the draft on which the Bopp edition was based. However, the second half of the Bopp edition contains the mathematically most advanced parts of Fatio's theory, and were not included by Gagnebin in his edition. For a detailed analysis of Fatio's work, and a comparison between the Bopp and the Gagnebin editions, see Zehe&lt;ref name=zehe&gt;Zehe (1980), secondary sources&lt;/ref&gt; The following description is mainly based on the Bopp edition.

=== Features of Fatio's theory ===
;Fatio's pyramid (Problem I):
[[Image:Fatio1.jpg|left|thumb|150px|&lt;div class="center"&gt;P6: Fatio's pyramid&lt;/div&gt;]]
Fatio assumed that the universe is filled with minute particles, which are moving indiscriminately with very high speed and rectilinearly in all directions. To illustrate his thoughts he used the following example: Suppose an object ''C'', on which an infinite small plane zz and a sphere centered about ''zz'' is drawn. Into this sphere Fatio placed the [[pyramid]] ''PzzQ'', in which some particles are streaming in the direction of ''zz'' and also some particles, which were already reflected by ''C'' and therefore depart from ''zz''. Fatio proposed that the mean velocity of the reflected particles is lower and therefore their momentum is weaker than that of the incident particles. The result is ''one stream'', which pushes all bodies in the direction of ''zz''. So on one hand the speed of the stream remains constant, but on the other hand at larger proximity to ''zz'' the density of the stream increases and therefore its intensity is proportional to 1/r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. And because one can draw an infinite number of such pyramids around ''C'', the proportionality applies to the entire range around ''C''.

;Reduced speed:
In order to justify the assumption, that the particles are traveling after their reflection with diminished velocities, Fatio stated the following assumptions:
* Either ordinary matter, or the gravific particles, or both are [[Inelastic collision|inelastic]], or
* the impacts are fully elastic, but the particles are not absolutely hard, and therefore are in a state of [[vibration]] after the impact, and/or
* due to [[friction]] the particles begin to [[Rotation|rotate]] after their impacts.
These passages are the most incomprehensible parts of Fatio's theory, because he never clearly decided which sort of collision he actually preferred. However, in the last version of his theory in 1742 he shortened the related passages and ascribed "perfect elasticity or spring force" to the particles and on the other hand "imperfect elasticity" to gross matter, therefore the particles would be reflected with diminished velocities. Additionally, Fatio faced another problem: What is happening if the particles collide with each other? Inelastic collisions would lead to a steady decrease of the particle speed and therefore a decrease of the gravitational force. To avoid this problem, Fatio supposed that the diameter of the particles is very small compared to their mutual distance, so their interactions are very rare.

;Condensation:
Fatio thought for a long time that, since corpuscles approach material bodies at a higher speed than they recede from them (after reflection), there would be a progressive accumulation of corpuscles near material bodies (an effect which he called "condensation"). However, he later realized that although the incoming corpuscles are quicker, they are spaced further apart than are the reflected corpuscles, so the inward and outward flow rates are the same. Hence there is no secular accumulation of corpuscles, i.e., the density of the reflected corpuscles remains constant (assuming that they are small enough that no noticeably greater rate of self-collision occurs near the massive body). More importantly, Fatio noted that, by increasing both the velocity and the elasticity of the corpuscles, the difference between the speeds of the incoming and reflected corpuscles (and hence the difference in densities) can be made arbitrarily small while still maintaining the same effective gravitational force.

;Porosity of gross matter:
[[Image:Fatio2.jpg|left|thumb|150px|&lt;div class="center"&gt;P7: Crystal lattice ([[icosahedron]])&lt;/div&gt;]]
In order to ensure mass proportionality, Fatio assumed that gross matter is extremely permeable to the flux of corpuscles. He sketched 3 models to justify this assumption:
* He assumed that matter is an accumulation of small "balls" whereby their diameter compared with their distance among themselves is "infinitely" small. But he rejected this proposal, because under this condition the bodies would approach each other and therefore would not remain stable.
* Then he assumed that the balls could be connected through bars or lines and would form some kind of crystal lattice. However, he rejected this model too - if several atoms are together, the gravific fluid is not able to penetrate this structure equally in all direction, and therefore mass proportionality is impossible.
* At the end Fatio also removed the balls and only left the lines or the net. By making them "infinitely" smaller than their distance among themselves, thereby a maximum penetration capacity could be achieved.

;Pressure force of the particles (Problem II):
Already in 1690 Fatio assumed, that the "push force" exerted by the particles on a plain surface is the sixth part of the force, which would be produced if all particles are lined up normal to the surface. Fatio now gave a proof of this proposal by determination of the force, which is exerted by the particles on a certain point zz. He derived the formula ''p=ρv&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;zz/6''. This solution is very similar to the formula known in the kinetic theory of gases ''p=ρv&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/3'', which was found by [[Daniel Bernoulli]] in 1738. This was the first time that a solution analogous to the similar result in [[kinetic theory of gases|kinetic theory]] was pointed out - long ''before'' the basic concept of the latter theory was developed. However, Bernoulli's value is twice as large as Fatio's one, because according to Zehe, Fatio only calculated the value ''mv'' for the change of impulse after the collision, but not ''2mv'' and therefore got the wrong result. (His result is only correct in the case of totally inelastic collisions.) Fatio tried to use his solution not only for explaining gravitation, but for explaining the behaviour of gases as well. He tried to construct a thermometer, which should indicate the "state of motion" of the air molecules and therefore estimate the temperature. But Fatio (unlike Bernoulli) did not ''identify'' heat and the movements of the air particles - he used another fluid, which should be responsible for this effect. It is also unknown, whether Bernoulli was influenced by Fatio or not.

;Infinity (Problem III):
In this chapter Fatio examines the connections between the term ''[[infinity]]'' and its relations to his theory. Fatio often justified his considerations with the fact that different phenomena are "infinitely smaller or larger" than others and so many problems can be reduced to an undetectable value. For example, the diameter of the bars is infinitely smaller than their distance to each other; or the speed of the particles is infinitely larger than those of gross matter; or the speed difference between reflected and non-reflected particles is infinitely small.

;Resistance of the medium (Problem IV):
This is the mathematically most complex part of Fatio's theory. There he tried to estimate the resistance of the particle streams for moving bodies. Supposing ''u'' is the velocity of gross matter, ''v'' is the velocity of the gravific particles and ''ρ'' the density of the medium. In the case ''v &lt;&lt; u'' and ''ρ = const.'' Fatio stated that the resistance is ''ρu&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''. In the case ''v &gt;&gt; u'' and ''ρ = const.'' the resistance is ''4/3ρuv''. Now, Newton stated that the lack of resistance to the orbital motion requires an extreme sparseness of any medium in space. So Fatio decreased the density of the medium and stated, that to maintain sufficient gravitational force this reduction must be compensated by changing v "''inverse proportional to the square root of the density''". This follows from Fatio's particle pressure, which is proportional to ''ρv&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''. According to Zehe, Fatio's attempt to increase v to a very high value would actually leave the resistance very small compared with gravity, because the resistance in Fatio's model is proportional to ''ρuv'' but gravity (i.e. the particle pressure) is proportional to ''ρv&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''.

=== Reception of Fatio's theory ===
Fatio was in communication with some of the most famous scientists of his time.
[[Image:Fatio3.jpg|right|thumb|350px|&lt;div class="center"&gt;P8: Signatures of [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], [[Christiaan Huygens|Huygens]] and [[Edmond Halley|Halley]] on Fatio's manuscript&lt;/div&gt;]]

There was a strong personal relationship between [[Isaac Newton]] and Fatio in the years 1690 to 1693. Newton's statements on Fatio's theory differed widely. For example, after describing the necessary conditions for a mechanical explanation of gravity, he wrote in an (unpublished) note in his own printed copy of the ''Principia'' in 1692:''The unique hypothesis by which gravity can be explained is however of this kind, and was first devised by the most ingenious geometer Mr. N. Fatio.''&lt;ref name=zehe /&gt; On the other hand, Fatio himself stated that although Newton had commented privately that Fatio's theory was the best possible ''mechanical'' explanation of gravity, he also acknowledged that Newton tended to believe that the true explanation of gravitation was not mechanical. Also, [[David Gregory (mathematician)|Gregory]] noted in his "Memoranda": "''Mr. Newton and Mr. Halley laugh at Mr. Fatio’s manner of explaining gravity.''"&lt;ref name=zehe /&gt; This was allegedly noted by him on December 28, 1691. However, the real date is unknown, because both ink and feather which were used, differ from the rest of the page. After 1694, the relationship between the two men cooled down.

[[Christiaan Huygens]] was the first person informed by Fatio of his theory, but never accepted it. Fatio believed he had convinced Huygens of the consistency of his theory, but Huygens denied this in a letter to [[Gottfried Leibniz]]. There was also a short correspondence between Fatio and Leibniz on the theory. Leibniz criticized Fatio's theory for demanding empty space between the particles, which was rejected by him (Leibniz) on philosophical grounds. [[Jakob Bernoulli]] expressed an interest in Fatio's Theory, and urged Fatio to write his thoughts on gravitation in a complete manuscript, which was actually done by Fatio. Bernoulli then copied the manuscript, which now resides in the university library of Basel, and was the base of the Bopp edition.

Nevertheless, Fatio's theory remained largely unknown with a few exceptions like Cramer and Le Sage, because he never was able to formally publish his works and he fell under the influence of a group of religious fanatics called the "French prophets" (which belonged to the [[camisard]]s) and therefore his public reputation was ruined.

== Cramer and Redeker ==
In 1731 the Swiss [[mathematician]] [[Gabriel Cramer]] published a dissertation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Cramer |first=G. |author-link=Gabriel Cramer |year=1731 |title=Theses Physico-Mathematicae de Gravitate (Dissertation) |place=Geneva }}&lt;/ref&gt; at the end of which appeared a sketch of a theory very similar to Fatio's - including net structure of matter, analogy to light, shading - but without mentioning Fatio's name. It was known to Fatio that Cramer had access to a copy of his main paper, so he accused Cramer of only repeating his theory without understanding it. It was also Cramer who informed Le Sage about Fatio's theory in 1749. In 1736 the German [[physician]] Franz Albert Redeker also published a similar theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Redeker |first=F. A. |year=1736 |title=De cause gravitatis meditatio |periodical=Lemgoviae ex officina Meyeriana}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any connection between Redeker and Fatio is unknown.

== Le Sage ==
{{see also|Georges-Louis Le Sage}}

[[Image:Lesage.jpg|thumb|left|150px|&lt;div class="center"&gt;[[Georges-Louis Le Sage]]&lt;/div&gt;]]
The first exposition of his theory, ''Essai sur l'origine des forces mortes'', was sent by Le Sage to the Academy of Sciences at Paris in 1748, but it was never published.&lt;ref name=notice /&gt; According to Le Sage, ''after'' creating and sending his [[essay]] he was informed on the theories of Fatio, Cramer and Redeker. In 1756 for the first time one of his expositions of the theory was published,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Sage |first=G.-L. Le  |year=1756 |title=Letter à une académicien de Dijon.. |journal=Mercure de France |pages=153–171 |author-mask=Georges-Louis Le Sage}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1758 he sent a more detailed exposition, ''Essai de Chymie Méchanique'', to a competition to the Academy of Sciences in [[Rouen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Sage |first=G.-L.

=== Le Sage's basic concept ===
[[Image:Lesage1.jpg|right|thumb|350px|&lt;div class="center"&gt;P9: Le Sage's own illustration of his ultramundane corpuscles&lt;/div&gt;]]
Le Sage discussed the theory in great detail and he proposed quantitative estimates for some of the theory's parameters.
* He called the gravitational particles ''ultramundane corpuscles'', because he supposed them to originate beyond our known universe. The distribution of the ultramundane flux is [[Isotropic radiation|isotropic]] and the laws of its propagation are very similar to that of light.
* Le Sage argued that no gravitational force would arise if the matter-particle-collisions are perfectly elastic . So he proposed that the particles and the basic constituents of matter are "absolutely hard" and asserted that this implies a complicated form of interaction, completely inelastic in the direction normal to the surface of the ordinary matter, and perfectly elastic in the direction tangential to the surface. He then commented that this implies the mean speed of scattered particles is 2/3 of their incident speed. To avoid inelastic collisions between the particles, he supposed that their diameter is very small relative to their mutual distance.
* That resistance of the flux is proportional to uv (where v is the velocity of the particles and u that of gross matter) and gravity is proportional to v&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, so the ratio resistance/gravity can be made arbitrarily small by increasing v. Therefore, he suggested that the ultramundane corpuscles might move at the [[speed of light]], but after further consideration he adjusted this to 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; times the speed of light.
* To maintain mass proportionality, ordinary matter consists of cage-like structures, in which their diameter is only the 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;th part of their mutual distance. Also the "bars", which constitute the cages, were small (around 10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; times as long as thick) relative to the dimensions of the cages, so the particles can travel through them nearly unhindered.
* Le Sage also attempted to use the shadowing mechanism to account for the forces of cohesion, and for forces of different strengths, by positing the existence of multiple species of ultramundane corpuscles of different sizes, as illustrated in Figure 9.
Le Sage said that he was the first one, who drew all consequences from the theory and also Prévost said that Le Sage's theory was more developed than Fatio's theory.&lt;ref name=notice /&gt; However, by comparing the two theories and after a detailed analysis of Fatio's papers (which also were in possession of Le Sage) Zehe judged that Le Sage contributed nothing essentially new and he often did not reach Fatio's level.&lt;ref name=zehe /&gt;

=== Reception of Le Sage's theory ===
Le Sage’s ideas were not well-received during his day, except for some of his friends and associates like [[Pierre Prévost]], [[Charles Bonnet]], [[Jean-André Deluc]], Charles Mahon, 3rd Earl Stanhope and [[Simon Lhuilier]]. They mentioned and described Le Sage's theory in their books and papers, which were used by their contemporaries as a secondary source for Le Sage's theory (because of the lack of published papers by Le Sage himself) .

;Euler, Bernoulli, and Boscovich:
[[Leonhard Euler]] once remarked that Le Sage's model was "infinitely better" than that of all other authors, and that all objections are balanced out in this model, but later he said the analogy to light had no weight for him, because he believed in the wave nature of light. After further consideration, Euler came to disapprove of the model, and he wrote to Le Sage:&lt;ref&gt;Wolf (1852), secondary sources&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|You must excuse me Sir, if I have a great repugnance for your ultramundane corpuscles, and I shall always prefer to confess my ignorance of the cause of gravity than to have recourse to such strange hypotheses.}}

[[Daniel Bernoulli]] was pleased by the similarity of Le Sage's model and his own thoughts on the nature of gases. However, Bernoulli himself was the opinion that his own kinetic theory of gases was only a speculation, and likewise he regarded Le Sage's theory as highly speculative.&lt;ref&gt;Evanes (2002), secondary sources&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Joseph Boscovich]] pointed out, that Le Sage's theory is the first one, which actually can explain gravity by mechanical means. However, he rejected the model because of the enormous and unused quantity of ultramundane matter. [[John Playfair]] described Boscovich's arguments by saying:

{{cquote|An immense multitude of atoms, thus destined to pursue their never ending journey through the infinity of space, without changing their direction, or returning to the place from which they came, is a supposition very little countenanced by the usual economy of nature. Whence is the supply of these innumerable torrents; must it not involve a perpetual exertion of creative power, infinite both in extent and in duration?&lt;ref&gt;Playfair (1807), secondary sources&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A very similar argument was later given by Maxwell (see the sections below). Additionally, Boscovich denied the existence of all contact and immediate impulse at all, but proposed repulsive and attractive [[Action at a distance (physics)|actions at a distance]].

;Lichtenberg, Kant, and Schelling:
[[Georg Christoph Lichtenberg]]'s&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Lichtenberg |first=G. C. |author-link=Georg Christoph Lichtenberg |title=Aufzeichnungen über die Theorie der Schwere von G.L. Le Sage |editor1=Zehe, H. |editor2=Hinrichs, W. |periodical=Nachrichten der Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Göttingen, II. Mathematisch-physikalische Klasse |year=2003 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; knowledge of Le Sage's theory was based on "Lucrece Newtonien" and a summary by Prévost. Lichtenberg originally believed (like Descartes) that every explanation of natural phenomena must be based on rectilinear motion and impulsion, and Le Sage's theory fulfilled these conditions. In 1790 he expressed in one of his papers his enthusiasm for the theory, believing that Le Sage's theory embraces all of our knowledge and makes any further dreaming on that topic useless. He went on by saying: ''"If it is a dream, it is the greatest and the most magnificent which was ever dreamed..."'' and that we can fill with it a gap in our books, which can only be filled by a dream.&lt;ref&gt;Lichtenberg, in German: ''"Ist es ein Traum, so ist es der größte und erhabenste der je ist geträumt worden, und womit wir eine Lücke in unseren Büchern ausfüllen können, die nur durch einen Traum ausgefüllt werden kann"''.&lt;/ref&gt;

He often referred to Le Sage's theory in his lectures on physics at the [[Georg August University of Göttingen|University of Göttingen]]. However, around 1796 Lichtenberg changed his views after being persuaded by the arguments of [[Immanuel Kant]], who criticized any kind of theory that attempted to replace attraction with impulsion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Kant |first=I. |author-link=Immanuel Kant |title=Metaphysische Anfangsgründe der Naturwissenschaft |pages=Dynamik, Lehrsatz 5 |year=1786 |url=http://philosophiebuch.de/metannat.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kant pointed out that the very existence of spatially extended configurations of matter, such as particles of non-zero radius, implies the existence of some sort of binding force to hold the extended parts of the particle together. Now, that force cannot be explained by the push from the gravitational particles, because those particles too must hold together in the same way. To avoid this [[Begging the question|circular reasoning]], Kant asserted that there must exist a fundamental attractive force. This was precisely the same objection that had always been raised against the impulse doctrine of Descartes in the previous century, and had led even the followers of Descartes to abandon that aspect of his philosophy.

Another German philosopher, [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]], rejected Le Sage's model because its mechanistic materialism was incompatible with Schelling's very idealistic and anti-materialistic philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Schelling |first=F.W.J. |author-link=Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling |title=Ideen zu einer Philosophie der Natur (2. book, 3. chapter) |year=1797 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7SQCAAAAQAAJ |publisher=[[Google]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Laplace:
Partly in consideration of Le Sage's theory, [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] undertook to determine the necessary [[speed of gravity]] in order to be consistent with astronomical observations. He calculated that the speed must be “at least a hundred millions of times greater than that of light”, in order to avoid unacceptably large inequalities due to aberration effects in the lunar motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Laplace |first=P.-S. |author-link=Pierre-Simon Laplace |title=A Treatise in Celestial Mechanics |volume=4 |issue=10 |chapter=7 |location=Chelsea, New York |year=1966 |origyear=1805}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was taken by most researchers, including Laplace, as support for the Newtonian concept of instantaneous action at a distance, and to indicate the implausibility of any model such as Le Sage's. Laplace also argued that to maintain mass-proportionality the upper limit for earth's molecular surface area is at the most the ten-millionth of earth surface. To Le Sage's disappointment, Laplace never directly mentioned Le Sage's theory in his works.

== Kinetic theory ==
Because the theories of Fatio, Cramer and Redeker were not widely known, Le Sage's exposition of the theory enjoyed a resurgence of interest in the latter half of the 19th century, coinciding with the development of the [[kinetic theory of gases|kinetic theory]].

;Leray:
Since Le Sage's particles must lose speed when colliding with ordinary matter (in order to produce a net gravitational force), a huge amount of energy must be converted to internal energy modes. If those particles have no internal energy modes, the excess energy can only be absorbed by ordinary matter. Addressing this problem, Armand Jean Leray&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Leray |first=le P. |title=Theorie nouvelle de la gravitation |journal=Comptes Rendus |volume=69 |pages=615–621 |year=1869 |url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k30260/f617.item}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a particle model (perfectly similar to Le Sage's) in which he asserted that the absorbed energy is used by the bodies to produce [[magnetism]] and [[heat]]. He suggested, that this might be an answer for the question of where the energy output of the stars comes from.

;Kelvin and Tait:
[[Image:Lord Kelvin photograph.jpg|thumb|150px|&lt;div class="center"&gt;[[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]]&lt;/div&gt;]]
Le Sage's ''own'' theory became a subject of re-newed interest in the latter part of the 19th century following a paper published by [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Kelvin]] in 1873.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Thomson |first=William (Lord Kelvin) |author-link=William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin |title=On the ultramundane corpuscles of Le Sage |journal=Phil. Mag. |volume=45 |pages=321–332 |year=1873 |url=http://www.hti.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?idno=aat1571.0005.001&amp;c=umhistmath&amp;seq=81&amp;size=s&amp;view=image}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Leray, who treated the heat problem imprecisely, Kelvin stated that the absorbed energy represents a very high heat, sufficient to vaporize any object in a fraction of a second. So Kelvin re-iterated an idea that Fatio had originally proposed in the 1690s for attempting to deal with the thermodynamic problem inherent in Le Sage's theory. He proposed that the excess heat might be absorbed by internal energy modes of the particles themselves, based on his proposal of the [[vortex]]-nature of matter. In other words, the original translational kinetic energy of the particles is transferred to internal energy modes, chiefly vibrational or rotational, of the particles. Appealing to Clausius's proposition that the energy in any particular mode of a gas molecule tends toward a fixed ratio of the total energy, Kelvin went on to suggest that the ''energized'' but slower moving particles would subsequently be restored to their original condition due to collisions (on the cosmological scale) with other particles. Kelvin also asserted that it would be possible to extract limitless amounts of free energy from the ultramundane flux, and described a [[perpetual motion]] machine to accomplish this.

Subsequently, [[Peter Guthrie Tait]] called the Le Sage theory the only plausible explanation of gravitation which has been propounded at that time. He went on by saying:

{{cquote|The most singular thing about it is that, if it be true, it will probably lead us to regard all kinds of energy as ultimately Kinetic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Tait |first=P. G. |author-link=Peter Guthrie Tait |title=Lectures on some recent advances in physical science with a special lecture on force |year=1876 |place= London|publisher=Macmillan and Co. |url=https://archive.org/details/lecturesonsomere00taitrich}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Kelvin himself, however, was not optimistic that Le Sage's theory could ultimately give a satisfactory account of phenomena. After his brief paper in 1873 noted above, he never returned to the subject, except to make the following comment:

{{cquote|This kinetic theory of matter is a dream, and can be nothing else, until it can explain chemical affinity, electricity, magnetism, gravitation, and the inertia of masses (that is, crowds) of vortices. Le Sage's theory might give an explanation of gravity and of its relation to inertia of masses, on the vortex theory, were it not for the essential aeolotropy of crystals, and the seemingly perfect isotropy of gravity. No finger post pointing towards a way that can possibly lead to a surmounting of this difficulty, or a turning of its flank, has been discovered, or imagined as discoverable.&lt;ref&gt;Kelvin, Popular Lectures, vol. i. p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

;Preston:
[[Samuel Tolver Preston]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Preston |first=S. T. |title=On some dynamical conditions applicable to LeSage’s theory of gravitation |journal=Phil. Mag. |series=5th Series |volume=4 |pages=206–213 (pt. 1) and 364–375 (pt. 2) |year=1877}}&lt;/ref&gt; illustrated that many of the postulates introduced by Le Sage concerning the gravitational particles, such as rectilinear motion, rare interactions, ''etc.''., could be collected under the single notion that they behaved (on the cosmological scale) as the particles of a gas with an extremely long [[mean free path]]. Preston also accepted Kelvin's proposal of internal energy modes of the particles. He illustrated Kelvin's model by comparing it with the collision of a steel ring and an anvil - the anvil would not be shaken very much, but the steel ring would be in a state of vibration and therefore departs with diminished velocity. He also argued, that the mean free path of the particles is at least the distance between the planets - on longer distances the particles regain their translational energy due collisions with each other, so he concluded that on longer distances there would be no attraction between the bodies, ''independent of their size''. [[Paul Drude]] suggested that this could possibly be a connection with some theories of [[Carl Gottfried Neumann]] and [[Hugo von Seeliger]], who proposed some sort of absorption of gravity in open space.&lt;ref&gt;Drude (1897), secondary sources&lt;/ref&gt;

;Maxwell:
[[Image:James Clerk Maxwell big.jpg|thumb|150px|&lt;div class="center"&gt;[[James Clerk Maxwell]]&lt;/div&gt;]]
A review of the Kelvin-Le Sage theory was published by [[James Clerk Maxwell]] in the Ninth Edition of the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] under the title ''Atom'' in 1875.&lt;ref name="Maxwell 38–47"&gt;{{cite EB9|mode=cs2 |inline=1 |last=Maxwell |first=J. C. |author-link=James Clerk Maxwell |wstitle=Atom |volume=3 |pages=38–47 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After describing the basic concept of the theory he wrote (with [[sarcasm]] according to Aronson):&lt;ref name=aronson&gt;{{harv|Aronson|1964}}, secondary sources&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|Here, then, seems to be a path leading towards an explanation of the law of gravitation, which, if it can be shown to be in other respects consistent with facts, may turn out to be a royal road into the very arcana of science.&lt;ref name="Maxwell 38–47"/&gt; }}

Maxwell commented on Kelvin’s suggestion of different energy modes of the particles that this implies the gravitational particles are not simple primitive entities, but rather systems, with their own internal energy modes, which must be held together by (unexplained) forces of attraction. He argues that the temperature of bodies must tend to approach that at which the average kinetic energy of a molecule of the body would be equal to the average kinetic energy of an ultra-mundane particle and he states that the latter quantity must be much greater than the former and concludes that ordinary matter should be incinerated within seconds under the Le Sage bombardment.&lt;ref name="Maxwell 38–47"/&gt; He wrote:

{{cquote|We have devoted more space to this theory than it seems to deserve, because it is ingenious, and because it is the only theory of the cause of gravitation which has been so far developed as to be capable of being attacked and defended.&lt;ref name="Maxwell 38–47"/&gt;}}

Maxwell also argued that the theory requires "an enormous expenditure of external power" and therefore violating the conservation of energy as the fundamental principle of nature.&lt;ref name="Maxwell 38–47"/&gt; Preston responded to Maxwell's criticism by arguing that the kinetic energy of each individual simple particle could be made arbitrarily low by positing a sufficiently low mass (and higher number density) for the particles. But this issue later was discussed in a more detailed way by [[Henri Poincaré|Poincaré]], who showed that the thermodynamic problem within Le Sage models remained unresolved.

;Isenkrahe, Ryšánek, du Bois-Reymond:
[[Caspar Isenkrahe]] presented his model in a variety of publications between 1879-1915.
&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Isenkrahe |first=C. |author-link=Caspar Isenkrahe |year=1879 |title=Das Räthsel von der Schwerkraft: Kritik der bisherigen Lösungen des Gravitationsproblems und Versuch einer neuen auf rein mechanischer Grundlage |place=Braunschweig |publisher=Friedrich Vieweg und Sohn}}&lt;/ref&gt;
His basic assumptions were very similar to those of Le Sage and Preston, but he gave a more detailed application of the kinetic theory. However, by asserting that the velocity of the corpuscles after collision was reduced without any corresponding increase in the energy of any other object, his model violated the conservation of energy. He noted that there is a connection between the weight of a body and its density (because any decrease in the density of an object reduces the internal shielding) so he went on to assert that warm bodies should be heavier than colder ones (related to the effect of [[thermal expansion]]).

In another model Adalbert Ryšánek in 1887
&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Ryšánek |first=A. |journal=Repert. Exp. Phys. |volume=24 |pages=90–115 |year=1887}}&lt;/ref&gt;
also gave a careful analysis, including an application of Maxwell's law of the particle velocities in a gas. He distinguished between a gravitational and a [[luminiferous aether]]. This separation of those two mediums was necessary, because according to his calculations the absence of any drag effect in the orbit of [[Neptune]] implies a lower limit for the particle velocity of 5 · 10&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; cm/s. He (like Leray) argued that the absorbed energy is converted into heat, which might be transferred into the luminiferous aether and/or is used by the stars to maintain their energy output. However, these qualitative suggestions were unsupported by any quantitative evaluation of the amount of heat actually produced.

In 1888 [[Paul du Bois-Reymond]] argued against Le Sage's model, partly because the predicted force of gravity in Le Sage's theory is not strictly proportional to mass. In order to achieve exact mass proportionality as in Newton's theory (which implies no shielding or saturation effects and an infinitely porous structure of matter), the ultramundane flux must be infinitely intense. Du Bois-Reymond rejected this as absurd. In addition, du Bois-Reymond like Kant observed that Le Sage's theory cannot meet its goal, because it invokes concepts like "elasticity" and "absolute hardness" etc., which (in his opinion) can only be explained by means of attractive forces. The same problem arises for the cohesive forces in molecules. As a result, the basic intent of such models, which is to dispense with elementary forces of attraction, is impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Bois-Reymond |first=P. du |author-link=Paul du Bois-Reymond |title=Ueber die Unbegreiflichkeit der Fernkraft |journal=Naturwissenschaftliche Rundschau |volume=3 |issue=14 |pages=169–176 |year=1888 |url=http://www.digizeitschriften.de/resolveppn/GDZPPN001069322}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wave models ==
;Keller and Boisbaudran:
In 1863, François Antoine Edouard and Em. Keller&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author1=Keller, F.A.E |author2=Keller, Ém. |title=Mémoire sur la cause de la pesanteur et des effets attribués à l'attraction universelle |journal=Comptes Rendus |volume=56 |pages=530–533 |year=1863 |url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k3013s/f530.item}}&lt;/ref&gt; presented a theory by using a Le Sage type mechanism in combination with [[longitudinal wave]]s of the aether. They supposed that those waves are propagating in every direction and losing some of their momentum after the impact on bodies, so between two bodies the pressure exerted by the waves is weaker than the pressure around them. In 1869, [[Paul-Emile Lecoq de Boisbaudran]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Boisbaudran |first=Lecoq de |title=Note sur la théorie de la pesanteur |journal=Comptes Rendus |volume=69 |pages=703–705 |year=1869 |url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k30260/f705.item}}&lt;/ref&gt; presented the same model as Leray (including absorption and the production of heat etc.), but like Keller and Keller, he replaced the particles with longitudinal waves of the aether.

;Lorentz:
[[Image:Hendrik Antoon Lorentz.jpg|thumb|150px|&lt;div align=center&gt;[[Hendrik Lorentz|Hendrik Antoon Lorentz]]&lt;/div&gt;]]
After these attempts, other authors in the early 20th century substituted [[electromagnetic radiation]] for Le Sage’s particles. This was in connection with [[Lorentz ether theory]] and the electron theory of that time, in which the electrical constitution of matter was assumed.

In 1900 [[Hendrik Lorentz]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Lorentz |first=H. A. |author-link=Hendrik Lorentz |title=Considerations on Gravitation |journal=Proc. Acad. Amsterdam |volume=2 |pages=559–574 |year=1900 |url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Considerations_on_Gravitation}}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote that Le Sage's particle model is not consistent with the electron theory of his time. But the realization that trains of electromagnetic waves could produce some pressure, in combination with the penetrating power of Röntgen rays (now called [[x-ray]]s), led him to conclude that nothing argues against the possible existence of even more penetrating radiation than x-rays, which could replace Le Sage's particles. Lorentz showed that an attractive force between charged particles (which might be taken to model the elementary subunits of matter) would indeed arise, but only if the incident energy were entirely absorbed. This was the same fundamental problem which had afflicted the particle models. So Lorentz wrote:

{{cquote|The circumstance however, that this attraction could only exist, if in some way or other electromagnetic energy were continually disappearing, is so serious a difficulty, that what has been said cannot be considered as furnishing an explanation of gravitation. Nor is this the only objection that can be raised. If the mechanism of gravitation consisted in vibrations which cross the aether with the velocity of light, the attraction ought to be modified by the motion of the celestial bodies to a much larger extent than astronomical observations make it possible to admit.}}

In 1922&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Lorentz |first=H. A. |author-link=Hendrik Lorentz |title=Lectures On Theoretical Physics|publisher=Macmillan and Co. |year=1927 |origyear=1922 |place= London |url=https://archive.org/details/lecturesontheore031600mbp}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lorentz first examined [[Martin Knudsen]]'s investigation on rarefied gases and in connection with that he discussed Le Sage's particle model, followed by a summary of his own electromagnetic Le Sage model - but he repeated his conclusion from 1900: Without absorption no gravitational effect.

In 1913 [[David Hilbert]] referred to Lorentz's theory and criticised it by arguing that no force in the form 1/r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; can arise, if the mutual distance of the atoms is large enough when compared with their wavelength.&lt;ref&gt;Corry (1999), secondary sources&lt;/ref&gt;

;J.J. Thomson:
In 1904 [[J. J. Thomson]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Thomson |first=J. J. |author-link=J. J. Thomson |title=Electricity and matter |place=Westminster |publisher=Archibald Constable &amp; Co., Ltd. |year=1904 |url=https://archive.org/details/electricitymatte00thomiala}}&lt;/ref&gt; considered a Le Sage-type model in which the primary ultramundane flux consisted of a hypothetical form of radiation much more penetrating even than x-rays. He argued that Maxwell's heat problem might be avoided by assuming that the absorbed energy is not converted into heat, but ''re-radiated'' in a still more penetrating form. He noted that this process possibly can explain where the energy of radioactive substances comes from - however, he stated that an internal cause of [[Radioactive decay|radioactivity]] is more probable. In 1911 Thomson went back to this subject in his article "Matter" in the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition]].&lt;ref name="Thompson 1911 p. 895"&gt;{{cite EB1911|mode=cs2 |last=Thomson |first=J. J. |author-link=J. J. Thomson |wstitle=Matter |volume=17 |pages=895}}&lt;/ref&gt; There he stated, that this form of secondary radiation is somewhat analogous to how the passage of electrified particles through matter causes the radiation of the even more penetrating x-rays. He remarked:

{{cquote|It is a very interesting result of recent discoveries that the machinery which Le Sage introduced for the purpose of his theory has a very close analogy with things for which we have now direct experimental evidence....Röntgen rays, however, when absorbed do not, as far as we know, give rise to more penetrating Röntgen rays as they should to explain attraction, but either to less penetrating rays or to rays of the same kind.&lt;ref name="Thompson 1911 p. 895"/&gt;}}

;Tommasina and Brush:

Unlike Lorentz and Thomson, [[Thomas Tommasina]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Tommasina |first=T. |title=La Physique de la Gravitation |place=Paris |publisher=Gauthier-Villars |year=1928}}&lt;/ref&gt; between 1903 and 1928 suggested long wavelength radiation to explain gravity, and short wavelength radiation for explaining the cohesive forces of matter. [[Charles F. Brush]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Brush |first=C. F. |author-link=Charles F. Brush |title=A kinetic theory of gravitation |journal=Nature |volume=86 |issue=2160 |pages=130–132 |year=1911 |doi=10.1038/086130a0 |bibcode=1911Natur..86..130. }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1911 also proposed long wavelength radiation. But he later revised his view and changed to extremely short wavelengths.

== Later assessments ==
;Darwin:
In 1905, [[George Darwin]] subsequently calculated the gravitational force between two bodies at extremely close range to determine if geometrical effects would lead to a deviation from Newton’s law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Darwin |first=G. H. |author-link=George Darwin |title=The analogy between Lesage’s theory of gravitation and the repulsion of light |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society |volume=76 |issue=511 |pages=387–410 |year=1905 |url=http://visualiseur.bnf.fr/CadresFenetre?O=NUMM-56169&amp;I=402&amp;M=imageseule |doi=10.1098/rspa.1905.0042 |bibcode=1905RSPSA..76..387D }}&lt;/ref&gt; Here Darwin replaced Le Sage's cage-like units of ordinary matter with microscopic hard spheres of uniform size. He concluded that only in the instance of perfectly inelastic collisions (zero reflection) would Newton’s law stand up, thus reinforcing the thermodynamic problem of Le Sage's theory. Also, such a theory is only valid if the normal ''and'' the tangential components of impact are totally inelastic (contrary to Le Sage's scattering mechanism), and the elementary particles are exactly of the same size. He went on to say that the emission of light is the exact converse of the absorption of Le Sage's particles. A body with different surface temperatures will move in the direction of the colder part. In a later review of gravitational theories, Darwin briefly described Le Sage's theory and said he gave the theory serious consideration, but then wrote:

{{cquote|I will not refer further to this conception, save to say that I believe that no man of science is disposed to accept it as affording the true road.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Darwin |first=G. H. |author-link=George Darwin |title=Introduction to Dynamical Astronomy |place= |publisher= |year=1916}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

;Poincaré:
[[Image:Poincare.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Henri Poincaré]]]]
Partially based on the calculations of Darwin, an important criticism was given by [[Henri Poincaré]] in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Poincaré |first=Henri |year=1913|title=The foundations of science (Science and Method)|chapter=[[s:The New Mechanics#The Theory of Lesage|The Theory of Lesage]]|place=New York|publisher=Science Press|pages=517–522}}&lt;/ref&gt; He concluded that the attraction is proportional to &lt;math&gt;S\sqrt{\rho}v&lt;/math&gt;, where ''S'' is earth's molecular surface area, ''v'' is the velocity of the particles, and ρ is the density of the medium. Following Laplace, he argued that to maintain mass-proportionality the upper limit for ''S'' is at the most a ten-millionth of the Earth's surface. Now, drag (i.e. the resistance of the medium) is proportional to ''Sρv'' and therefore the ratio of drag to attraction is inversely proportional to ''Sv''. To reduce drag, Poincaré calculated a lower limit for ''v'' = 24 · 10&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; times the speed of light. So there are lower limits for ''Sv'' and v, and an upper limit for ''S'' and with those values one can calculate the produced heat, which is proportional to ''Sρv&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;''. The calculation shows that earth's temperature would rise by 10&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt; degrees per second. Poincaré noticed, ''"that the earth could not long stand such a regime."'' Poincaré also analyzed some wave models (Tommasina and Lorentz), remarking that they suffered the same problems as the particle models. To reduce drag, superluminal wave velocities were necessary, and they would still be subject to the heating problem. After describing a similar re-radiation model like Thomson, he concluded: ''"Such are the complicated hypotheses to which we are led when we seek to make Le Sage's theory tenable"''.

He also stated that if in Lorentz' model the absorbed energy is fully converted into heat, that would raise earth's temperature by 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; degrees per second. Poincaré then went on to consider Le Sage's theory in the context of the "new dynamics" that had been developed at the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th centuries, specifically recognizing the relativity principle. For a particle theory, he remarked that "''it is difficult to imagine a law of collision compatible with the principle of relativity''", and the problems of drag and heating remain.

== Predictions and criticism ==

=== Matter and particles ===
;Porosity of matter:
A basic prediction of the theory is the extreme porosity of matter. As supposed by Fatio and Le Sage in 1690/1758 (and before them, Huygens) matter must consist mostly of empty space so that the very small particles can penetrate the bodies nearly undisturbed and therefore every single part of matter can take part in the gravitational interaction. This prediction has been (in some respects) confirmed over the course of the time. Indeed, matter consists mostly of empty space and certain particles like [[neutrino]]s can pass through matter nearly unhindered. However, the image of elementary particles as classical entities who interact directly, determined by their shapes and sizes (in the sense of the net structure proposed by Fatio/Le Sage and the equisized spheres of Isenkrahe/Darwin), is not consistent with current understanding of elementary particles. The Lorentz/Thomson proposal of electrical charged particles as the ''basic constituents'' of matter is inconsistent with current physics as well.

;Cosmic radiation:
Every Le Sage-type model assumes the existence of a space-filling isotropic flux or radiation of enormous intensity and penetrating capability. This has some similarity to the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] (CMBR) discovered in the 20th century. CMBR is indeed a space-filling and fairly isotropic flux, but its intensity is extremely small, as is its penetrating capability. The flux of neutrinos, emanating from (for example) the [[sun]], possesses the penetrating properties envisaged by Le Sage for his ultramundane corpuscles, but this flux is not isotropic (since individual stars are the main sources of neutrinos) and the intensity is even less than that of the CMBR. Of course, neither the CMBR nor neutrinos propagate at superluminal speeds, which is another necessary attribute of Le Sage’s particles. From a more modern point of view, discarding the simple “push” concept of Le Sage, the suggestion that the neutrino (or some other particle similar to the neutrino) might be the mediating particle in a quantum field theory of gravitation was considered and disproved by Feynman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Feynman |first=R. P. |author-link=Richard Feynman |title=Feynman Lectures on Gravitation |pages=23–28 |year=1995 |publisher=Addison-Wesley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gravitational shielding ===
[[Image:Pushing6.svg|left|thumb|250px|&lt;div align=center&gt;P10: Gravitational Shielding&lt;/div&gt;]]
Although matter is postulated to be very sparse in the Fatio-Le Sage theory, it cannot be perfectly transparent, because in that case no gravitational force would exist. However, the lack of perfect transparency leads to problems: with sufficient mass the amount of shading produced by two pieces of matter becomes less than the sum of the shading that each of them would produce separately, due to the overlap of their shadows (P10, above). This hypothetical effect, called [[Gravity shielding|gravitational shielding]], implies that addition of matter does not result in a direct proportional increase in the gravitational mass.  Therefore, in order to be viable, Fatio and Le Sage postulated that the shielding effect is so small as to be undetectable, which requires that the interaction cross-section of matter must be extremely small (P10, below). This places an extremely high lower-bound on the intensity of the flux required to produce the observed force of gravity. Any form of gravitational shielding would represent a violation of the [[equivalence principle]], and would be inconsistent with the extremely precise [[null result]] observed in the [[Eötvös experiment]] and its successors — all of which have instead confirmed [[Equivalence principle#The weak equivalence principle|the precise equivalence of active and passive gravitational mass with inertial mass]] that was predicted by [[general relativity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |last1=Bertolami |first1=O |last2=Paramos |first2=J |display-authors=etal |eprint=gr-qc/0602016 |title=General Theory of Relativity: Will it survive the next decade? |class= |date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; For more historical information on the connection between gravitational shielding and Le Sage gravity, see Martins,&lt;ref&gt;Martin (1999), secondary sources&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martins (2002), secondary sources&lt;/ref&gt; and Borzeszkowski et al.&lt;ref&gt;Borzeskkowski et al.

Since Isenkrahe's proposal on the connection between density, temperature and weight was based purely on the anticipated effects of changes in material ''density'', and since temperature at a given density can be increased or decreased, Isenkrahe's comments do not imply any fundamental relation between [[temperature]] and gravitation. (There actually ''is'' a relation between temperature and gravitation, as well as between binding energy and gravitation, but these actual effects have nothing to do with Isenkrahe's proposal. See the section below on "Coupling to Energy".) Regarding the prediction of a relation between gravitation and density, all experimental evidence indicates that there is no such relation.

=== Speed of gravity ===
;Drag:
According to Le Sage's theory, an isolated body is subjected to [[drag (physics)|drag]] if it is in motion relative to the unique isotropic frame of the ultramundane flux (i.e., the frame in which the speed of the ultramundane corpuscles is the same in all directions). This is due to the fact that, if a body is in motion, the particles striking the body from the front have a higher speed (relative to the body) than those striking the body from behind - this effect will act to ''decrease'' the distance between the sun and the earth. The magnitude of this drag is proportional to vu, where v is the speed of the particles and u is the speed of the body, whereas the characteristic force of gravity is proportional to v&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, so the ratio of drag to gravitational force is proportional to u/v. Thus for a given characteristic strength of gravity, the amount of drag for a given speed u can be made arbitrarily small by increasing the speed v of the ultramundane corpuscles. However, in order to reduce the drag to an acceptable level (i.e., consistent with observation) in terms of classical mechanics, the speed v must be many orders of magnitude greater than the [[speed of light]]. This makes Le Sage theory fundamentally incompatible with the modern science of mechanics based on [[special relativity]], according to which no particle (or wave) can exceed the speed of light. In addition, even if superluminal particles were possible, the effective temperature of such a flux would be sufficient to incinerate all ordinary matter in a fraction of a second.

;Aberration:
As shown by Laplace, another possible Le Sage effect is orbital aberration due to finite [[speed of gravity]].  Unless the Le Sage particles are moving at speeds much greater than the speed of light, as Le Sage and Kelvin supposed, there is a time delay in the interactions between bodies (the transit time).  In the case of orbital motion this results in each body reacting to a retarded position of the other, which creates a leading force component.  Contrary to the drag effect, this component will act to accelerate both objects away from each other.  In order to maintain stable orbits, the effect of gravity must either propagate much faster than the speed of light or must not be a purely central force. This has been suggested by many as a conclusive disproof of any Le Sage type of theory. In contrast, general relativity is consistent with the lack of appreciable aberration identified by Laplace, because even though gravity propagates at the speed of light in general relativity, the expected aberration is almost exactly cancelled by velocity-dependent terms in the interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Carlip |first=S. |title=Aberration and the Speed of Gravity |journal= Phys. Lett. A |volume=267 |pages=81–87 |year=1999 |arxiv=gr-qc/9909087|bibcode=2000PhLA..267...81C |doi=10.1016/S0375-9601(00)00101-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Range of gravity ===
In many particle models, such as Kelvin's, the range of gravity is limited due to the nature of particle interactions amongst themselves. The range is effectively determined by the rate that the proposed ''internal modes'' of the particles can eliminate the momentum defects (''shadows'') that are created by passing through matter. Such predictions as to the effective range of gravity will vary and are dependent upon the specific aspects and assumptions as to the modes of interactions that are available during particle interactions.  However, for this class of models the observed [[large-scale structure of the cosmos]] constrains such dispersion to those that will allow for the aggregation of such immense gravitational structures.

=== Energy ===
;Absorption:
As noted in the historical section, a major problem for every Le Sage model is the [[energy]] and [[heat]] issue. As Maxwell and Poincaré showed, [[inelastic collision]]s lead to a [[vaporization]] of matter within fractions of a second and the suggested solutions were not convincing. For example, Aronson&lt;ref name=aronson /&gt; gave a simple proof of Maxwell's assertion:

{{cquote|Suppose that, contrary to Maxwell's hypothesis, the [[molecule]]s of gross matter actually possess more energy than the particles. In that case the particles would, on the average, gain energy in the collision and the particles intercepted by body B would be replaced by more energetic ones rebounding from body B. Thus the effect of gravity would be reversed: there would be a mutual repulsion between all bodies of mundane matter, contrary to observation. If, on the other hand, the average kinetic energies of the particles and of the molecules are the same, then no net transfer of energy would take place, and the collisions would be equivalent to elastic ones, which, as has been demonstrated, do not yield a gravitational force.}}

Likewise Isenkrahe's violation of the [[energy conservation law]] is unacceptable, and Kelvin's application of Clausius' theorem leads (as noted by Kelvin himself) to some sort of [[perpetual motion]] mechanism. The suggestion of a secondary re-radiation mechanism for wave models attracted the interest of JJ Thomson, but was not taken very seriously by either Maxwell or Poincaré, because it entails a gross violation of the second law of [[thermodynamics]] (huge amounts of energy spontaneously being converted from a colder to a hotter form), which is one of the most solidly established of all physical laws.

The energy problem has also been considered in relation to the idea of mass accretion in connection with the [[Expanding Earth theory]]. Among the early theorists to link mass increase in some sort of push gravity model to Earth expansion were [[Ivan Osipovich Yarkovsky|Yarkovsky]] and [[Ott Christoph Hilgenberg|Hilgenberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  |editor1=Scalera, G. |editor2=Jacob, K.-H. |title=Why expanding Earth? – A book in honour of O.C. Hilgenberg |year=2003 |place=Rome |publisher= INGV}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of mass accretion and the expanding earth theory are not currently considered to be viable by mainstream scientists. This is because, among other reasons, according to the principle of [[mass-energy equivalence]], if the Earth was absorbing the energy of the ultramundane flux at the rate necessary to produce the observed force of gravity (i.e. by using the values calculated by Poincaré), its mass would be doubling in each fraction of a second.

;Coupling to energy:
Based on [[Equivalence principle#Tests of the weak equivalence principle|observational evidence]], it is now known that [[Equivalence principle#The strong equivalence principle|gravity interacts with all forms of energy]], and not just with mass.  The electrostatic binding energy of the nucleus, the energy of weak interactions in the nucleus, and the kinetic energy of electrons in atoms, all contribute to the gravitational mass of an atom, as has been confirmed to high precision in [[Eötvös experiment|Eötvös type]] experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Carlip |first=S. |title=Kinetic Energy and the Equivalence Principle |journal=Am. J. Phys. |volume=65 |pages=409–413 |year=1997 |arxiv=gr-qc/9909014 |bibcode=1998AmJPh..66..409C |doi=10.1119/1.18885 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This means, for example, that when the atoms of a quantity of gas are moving more rapidly, the gravitation of that gas increases.
Moreover, [[Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment|Lunar Laser Ranging experiments]] have shown that even gravitational binding energy itself also gravitates, with a strength consistent with the [[equivalence principle]] to high precision
—
which furthermore demonstrates that any successful theory of gravitation must be nonlinear and self-coupling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Adelberger |first=E.G. |last2=Heckel |first2=B.R. |last3=Smith |first3=G. |last4=Su |first4=Y. |last5=Swanson |first5=H.E. |title=Eötvös experiments, lunar ranging and the strong equivalence principle |journal=Nature |volume=347 |issue=6290 |pages=261–263 |date=Sep 20, 1990 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v347/n6290/abs/347261a0.html |doi=10.1038/347261a0|bibcode=1990Natur.347..261A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Le Sage's theory does not predict any of these aforementioned effects, nor do any of the known variants of Le Sage's theory.

== Non-gravitational applications and analogies ==
;Mock gravity:
[[Lyman Spitzer]] in 1941&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Spitzer |first=L. |authorlink=Lyman Spitzer |title=The dynamics of the interstellar medium; II. Radiation pressure |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |year=1941 |volume=94 |pages=232–244 |bibcode=1941ApJ....94..232S |doi=10.1086/144328 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; calculated, that absorption of radiation between two [[dust|dust particles]] lead to a net attractive force which varies proportional to 1/r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (evidently he was unaware of Le Sage's shadow mechanism and especially Lorentz's considerations on radiation pressure and gravity).

Absorption of the radiation lead to a Lesage mechanism between the electrons, which might have had an important role in the process of [[galaxy formation]] shortly after the [[big bang]]. However, this proposal was disproved by Field in 1971,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Field |first=G.

But it was shown by Wang and Field&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Wang |first=B. |last2=Field |first2=G.B. |title=Galaxy formation by mock gravity with dust? |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |year=1989 |volume=346 |pages=3–11 |bibcode=1989ApJ...346....3W |doi=10.1086/167981 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; that any form of mock gravity is incapable of producing enough force to influence galaxy formation.

;Plasma:
The Le Sage mechanism also has been identified as a significant factor in the behavior of [[dusty plasma]]. A.M. Ignatov&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Ignatov |first=A.M. |title=Lesage gravity in dusty plasma |journal=Plasma Physics Reports |year=1996 |volume=22 |issue=7 |pages=585–589 |bibcode=1996PlPhR..22..585I }}&lt;/ref&gt; has shown that an attractive force arises between two dust grains suspended in an isotropic collisionless plasma due to inelastic collisions between ions of the plasma and the grains of dust. This attractive force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between dust grains, and can counterbalance the Coulomb repulsion between dust grains.

;Vacuum energy:
In [[quantum field theory]] the existence of [[virtual particles]] is proposed, which lead to the so-called [[Casimir effect]]. Casimir calculated that between two plates only particles with specific wavelengths should be counted when calculating the [[vacuum energy]].  Therefore, the energy density between the plates is less if the plates are close together, leading to a net attractive force between the plates. However, the conceptual framework of this effect is very different from the theory of Fatio and Le Sage.

== Recent activity ==
The re-examination of Le Sage's theory in the 19th century identified several closely interconnected problems with the theory.  These relate to excessive heating, frictional drag, shielding, and gravitational aberration.  The recognition of these problems, in conjunction with a general shift away from mechanical based theories, resulted in a progressive loss of interest in Le Sage’s theory. Ultimately in the 20th century Le Sage’s theory was eclipsed by Einstein’s theory of [[general relativity]].

In 1965 [[Richard Feynman]] examined the Fatio/Lesage mechanism, primarily as an example of an attempt to explain a ''"complicated"'' physical law (in this case, Newton's inverse-square law of gravity) in terms of simpler primitive operations without the use of complex mathematics, and also as an example of a failed theory. He notes that the mechanism of ''"bouncing particles"'' reproduces the inverse-square force law and that ''"the strangeness of the mathematical relation will be very much reduced"'', but then remarks that the scheme ''"does not work"'', because of the drag it predicts would be experienced by moving bodies, ''"so that is the end of that theory"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Feynman |first=R.

Instead of a single "inventor", the [[Internet]] was developed by many people over many years. The following are some '''Internet pioneers''' who contributed to its early development. These include early theoretical foundations, specifying original protocols, and expansion beyond a research tool to wide deployment.

==The pioneers==

===Claude Shannon===
{{main|Claude Shannon}}

'''Dennis M. Jennings''' is an Irish physicist, academic, Internet pioneer, and venture capitalist. In 1984, the [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) began construction of several regional [[supercomputing]] centers to provide very high-speed computing resources for the US research community. In 1985 NSF hired Jennings to lead the establishment of the [[National Science Foundation Network]] (NSFNET) to link five of the super-computing centers to enable sharing of resources and information. Jennings made three critical decisions that shaped the subsequent development of NSFNET:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livinginternet.com/i/ii_nsfnet.htm "Internet &gt; History &gt; NSFNET -- National Science Foundation Network"], ''livinginternet.com: The World's First Web Published Book'', 2000, accessed 16 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; 
* that it would be a general-purpose research network, not limited to connection of the supercomputers; 
* it would act as the backbone for connection of regional networks at each supercomputing site; and 
* it would use the [[ARPANET]]'s [[Internet protocol suite|TCP/IP protocols]].

Jennings was also actively involved in the start-up of research networks in Europe ([[European Academic Research Network]], EARN - President; [[EBONE]] - Board member) and Ireland ([[HEAnet]] - initial proposal and later Board member). He chaired the Board and General Assembly of the [[Council of European National Top Level Domain Registries]] (CENTR) from 1999 to early 2001 and was actively involved in the start-up of the [[Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers]] (ICANN). He was a member of the ICANN Board from 2007 to 2010, serving as Vice-Chair in 2009-2010.&lt;ref name=RealNetPioneer&gt;[http://www.independent.ie/business/technology/irelandrsquos-real-net-pioneer-1115628.html "Ireland's real net pioneer"], ''Independent.ie'', 4 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2014 Jennings was inducted into the Internet Hall of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.internethalloffame.org/inductees/dennis-jennings "Dennis Jennings Internet Hall of Fame Pioneer"], Internet Hall of Fame, April 2014.

    '''BIRTH OF THE INTERNET'''
 &lt;small&gt;
    THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE INTERNET AND THE DESIGN OF
    THE CORE NETWORKING PROTOCOL TCP (WHICH LATER BECAME TCP/IP)
    WERE CONCEIVED BY VINTON G. CERF AND ROBERT E. KAHN DURING 1973
    WHILE CERF WAS AT STANFORD'S DIGITAL SYSTEMS LABORATORY AND
    KAHN WAS AT ARPA (LATER DARPA). IN THE SUMMER OF 1976, CERF LEFT STANFORD
    TO MANAGE THE PROGRAM WITH KAHN AT ARPA.
 
    THEIR WORK BECAME KNOWN IN SEPTEMBER 1973 AT A NETWORKING CONFERENCE IN ENGLAND.
    CERF AND KAHN'S SEMINAL PAPER WAS PUBLISHED IN MAY 1974.
 
    CERF, YOGEN K. DALAL, AND CARL SUNSHINE
    WROTE THE FIRST FULL TCP SPECIFICATION IN DECEMBER 1974.
    WITH THE SUPPORT OF DARPA, EARLY IMPLEMENTATIONS OF TCP (AND IP LATER)
    WERE TESTED BY BOLT BERANEK AND NEWMAN (BBN),
    STANFORD, AND UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON DURING 1975.
 
    BBN BUILT THE FIRST INTERNET GATEWAY, NOW KNOWN AS A ROUTER, TO LINK NETWORKS TOGETHER.
    IN SUBSEQUENT YEARS, RESEARCHERS AT MIT AND USC-ISI, AMONG MANY OTHERS,
    PLAYED KEY ROLES IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SET OF INTERNET PROTOCOLS.

This is a list of sites where claims for the use of [[archaeoastronomy]] have been made, sorted by country.

[[Clive Ruggles]] and Michel Cotte have edited a book on heritage sites of astronomy and archaeoastronomy that provides a list of the main archaeoastronomical sites around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Clive Ruggles and Michel Cotte (ed.), Heritage Sites of Astronomy and Archaeoastronomy. ICOMOS and IAU, Paris, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Armenia==
* [[Zorats Karer]] (aka Carahunge), archeological site claimed to have astronomical significance although this is disputed.

==Australia==
* [[Australian Aboriginal Astronomy|Ngaut Ngaut]] oral tradition says these engravings represent lunar cycles.&lt;ref name="csiro"&gt;[http://www.atnf.csiro.au/research/AboriginalAstronomy/ Australian Aboriginal Astronomy] at the [[CSIRO]] site. Accessed on 2009-08-02.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brazil==
* [[Calçoene]] (called "Amazon Stonehenge")

==Bulgaria==

* [[Magura Cave]],  Bronze Age "paintings of staggered black and white squares could have been used to count the days in a calendar month", possibly indicating the number of days in the solar tropical year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Stoev | first = Alexey | last2 = Maglova | first2 = Penka | editor1-last = Ruggles | editor1-first = Clive L.

==Egypt==
* [[Abu Simbel]], The axis of the temple was positioned by the ancient Egyptian architects in such a way that twice a year, on October 20 and February 20, the rays of the sun would penetrate the sanctuary and illuminate the sculpture on the back wall, except for the statue of [[Ptah]], the god connected with the [[Underworld]], who always remained in the dark.&lt;ref&gt;Alberto Siliotti, Egypt: temples, people, gods,1994&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ania Skliar, Grosse kulturen der welt-Ägypten, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Finland==
*The so-called [[Giant's Church|Giants' Churches]] (Finn. ''jätinkirkko''), which are large, from c. {{convert|20|m|ft}} to over {{convert|70|m|ft}} long rectangular or oval stone enclosures built in the Neolithic (c. 3000-1800 BC), have axis and doorway orientations towards the sunrises and sunsets of the solstices and other calendrically significant days. For example, the Kastelli of Raahe, which is one of the largest Giants' Churches, had its five "gates", i.e. wall openings, oriented towards the midsummer sunset, the winter solstice sunrise, winter solstice sunset, the sunrises of the mid-quarter days of early May (Walpurgis, Beltaine) and August (Lammas), as well as the sunrise 11 days before the vernal equinox in 2500 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Okkonen, J. &amp; Ridderstad, M. 2009: Jätinkirkkojen aurinkosuuntauksia; in ''Ei kiveäkään kääntämättä, Juhlakirja Pentti Koivuselle'', pp. 129-136.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tähdet ja Avaruus, Ursa astronomical assosiacion's magazine 4 / 2009 p.15&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Mound of the Hostages]]
* [[Drombeg stone circle]], at the winter solstice, the sun sets into a v formed by two distant overlapping hills and makes an alignment with the altar stone and the two main uprights. Due to the nature of the site and the western hills, local sunset is c. 15:50.
* [[Beltany stone circle]]
* [[Beaghmore Stone Circles]], a complex of early Bronze Age megalithic features, stone circles and cairns.  Some archaeologists believe that the circles have been constructed in relation to the rising of the sun at the solstice, or to record the movements of the sun and moon acting as observatories for particular lunar, solar or stellar events. Three of the stone rows point to the sunrise at the time of the solstice and another is aligned towards moonrise at the same period.

As on the Moon and Mars, sequences of craters and basins of differing relative ages provide the best means of establishing stratigraphic order on Mercury.&lt;ref name="h11.pdf"&gt;{{cite book| url=https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/Projects/PlanetaryMapping/DIGGEOL/mercury/h11/h11.pdf| title=Geologic Map of the Discovery (H-11) Quadrangle of Mercury| first=Newell J.| last= Trask|author2=Daniel Dzurisin | year=1984| publisher= U.S. Geological Survey| accessdate=December 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pohn, H. A., and Offield, T. W., 1970, Lunar crater morphology and relative-age determination of lunar geologic units—Part 1. Classification: in Geological Survey research 1970, U.S. Geological Survey Professional Paper 700-C, p. C153–C162.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stuart-Alexander, D. E., and Wilhelms, D. E., 1975, The Nectarian System, a new lunar time-stratigraphic unit: U.S. Geological Survey Journal of Research, v. 3, no. l, p. 53–58.&lt;/ref&gt; Overlap relations among many large mercurian craters and basins are clearer than those on the Moon. Therefore, as this map shows, we can build up many local stratigraphic columns involving both crater or basin materials and nearby plains materials.

Over all of Mercury, the crispness of crater rims and the morphology of their walls, central peaks, ejecta deposits, and secondary-crater fields have undergone systematic changes with time. The youngest craters or basins in a local stratigraphic sequence have the sharpest, crispest appearance. The oldest craters consist only of shallow depressions with slightly raised, rounded rims, some incomplete. On this basis, five age categories of craters and basins have been mapped; the characteristics of each are listed in the explanation. In addition, [[secondary crater]] fields are preserved around proportionally far more craters and basins on Mercury than on the Moon or Mars, and are particularly useful in determining overlap relations and degree of modification.

Because only limited photographic evidence was available from ''[[Mariner 10]]''{{'}}s three flybys of the planet, these divisions are often tentative. The five crater groups, from youngest to oldest, are:
* c5: Fresh-appearing, sharp-rimmed, [[rayed crater]]s. Highest albedo in map area; haloes and rays may extend many crater diameters from rim crests. Superposed on all other map units. Generally smaller and fewer than older craters.
* c4: Fresh but slightly modified craters—Similar in morphology to c5 craters but without bright haloes or rays; sharp rim crests; continuous ejecta blankets; very few superposed [[secondary crater]]s. Floors consist of crater or smooth plains materials.
* c3: Modified craters—Rim crest continuous but slightly rounded and subdued. Ejecta blanket generally less extensive than those of younger craters of similar size. Superposed craters and rays common; smooth plains and intermediate plains materials cover floors of many craters. Central peaks more common than in c4 craters, probably because of larger average size of c3 craters.
* c2: Subdued craters—Low-rimmed, relatively shallow craters, many with discontinuous rim crests. Floors covered by smooth plains and intermediate plains materials. Crater density of ejecta blankets similar to that of intermediate plains material.
* c1 Degraded craters—Similar to c2 crater material but more deteriorated; many superposed craters.

:''This is a list of the chemical elements and their isotopes, listed in terms of stability.''

Atomic [[Atomic nucleus|nuclei]] consist of [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s, which attract each other through the [[nuclear force]], while protons repel each other via the [[electric force]] due to their positive [[charge (physics)|charge]]. These two forces compete, leading to some combinations of neutrons and protons being more stable than others. Neutrons stabilize the nucleus, because they attract protons, which helps offset the electrical repulsion between protons. As a result, as the number of protons increases, an increasing [[proton-neutron ratio|ratio of neutrons to protons]] is needed to form a stable nucleus; if too many or too few neutrons are present with regard to the optimum ratio, the nucleus becomes unstable and subject to certain types of [[nuclear decay]]. Unstable isotopes decay through various [[radioactive decay|radioactive decay pathways]], most commonly [[alpha decay]], [[beta decay]], or [[electron capture]]. Many other rare types of decay, such as [[spontaneous fission]] or [[cluster decay]] are known. (See [[radioactive decay]] for details.)

[[File:Isotopes and half-life.svg|right|thumb|300px|Isotope half-lives. Note that the darker more stable isotope region departs from the line of protons (Z) = neutrons (N), as the element number Z becomes larger]]

Of the first 82 elements in the [[periodic table]], 80 have [[isotope]]s considered to be stable.&lt;ref name=nuclidetable/&gt; The 83rd element, bismuth, was traditionally regarded as having the heaviest stable isotope, [[bismuth-209]], but in 2003 researchers in [[Orsay]], France, measured the [[half-life]] of {{SimpleNuclide2|Bismuth|209|link=yes}} to be {{val|1.9|e=19|u=years}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Marcillac|first = Pierre de| author2 = Noël Coron| author3 = Gérard Dambier| author4 = Jacques Leblanc| author5 = Jean-Pierre Moalic| last-author-amp = yes|date=2003|title = Experimental detection of α-particles from the radioactive decay of natural bismuth|journal = Nature|volume = 422|pages = 876–878|pmid=12712201|doi = 10.1038/nature01541|issue = 6934| bibcode= 2003Natur.422..876D}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://physicsweb.org/articles/news/7/4/16| title=Bismuth breaks half-life record for alpha decay| date=2003-04-23 | publisher=[[Institute of Physics]] Publishing| first=Belle| last= Dumé}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Technetium]], [[promethium]] ([[atomic number]]s 43 and 61, respectively{{ref label|Note1|a|a}}) and all the elements with an atomic number over 82 only have isotopes that are known to decompose through [[radioactive decay]]. No undiscovered elements are expected to be stable; therefore, [[lead]] is considered the heaviest stable element. However, it is possible that some isotopes that are now considered stable will be revealed to decay with extremely long half-lives (as with {{SimpleNuclide2|Bismuth|209|link=yes}}). This list depicts what is agreed upon by the consensus of the scientific community as of 2016.&lt;ref name=nuclidetable/&gt;

For each of the 80 stable elements, the number of the stable isotopes is given. Only 90 isotopes are expected to be perfectly stable, and an additional 163 are energetically unstable,{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} but have never been observed to decay. Thus, 253 isotopes ([[nuclide]]s) are [[stable isotope|stable]] by definition (including tantalum-180m, for which no decay has yet been observed). Those that may in the future be found to be radioactive are expected to have half-lives longer than 10&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt; years (for example, xenon-134).{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

Of the chemical elements, only one element ([[tin]]) has 10 such stable isotopes, one ([[xenon]]) has eight isotopes, four have seven isotopes, eight have six isotopes, ten have five isotopes, nine have four isotopes, five have three stable isotopes, 16 have two stable isotopes, and 26 have a single stable isotope.&lt;ref name=nuclidetable/&gt;

Additionally, about 29 nuclides of the naturally occurring elements have unstable isotopes with a half-life larger than the age of the [[Solar System]] (~10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; years or more).{{ref label|Note2|b|b}} An additional four nuclides have half-lives longer than 100 million years, which is far less than the age of the solar system, but long enough for some of them to have survived. These 33 radioactive naturally occurring nuclides comprise the ''radioactive'' [[primordial nuclide]]s. The total number of primordial nuclides is then 253 (the stable nuclides) ''plus'' the 33 radioactive primordial nuclides, for a ''total'' of 286 primordial nuclides. This number is subject to change if new shorter-lived primordials are identified on Earth.

One of the primordial nuclides is [[tantalum-180m]], which is predicted to have a half-life in excess of 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; years, but has never been observed to decay. The even longer half-life of 7.7 x 10&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt; years of [[tellurium-128]] was measured by a unique method of detecting its radiogenic daughter [[xenon-128]] and is the longest known experimentally measured half-life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://presolar.wustl.edu/work/noblegas.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928143717/http://presolar.wustl.edu/work/noblegas.html |archivedate=2011-09-28 |df= }} Novel Gas Research. Accessed April 26, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Another notable example is the only naturally occurring isotope of bismuth, [[bismuth-209]], which has been predicted to be unstable with a very long half-life, but has been observed to decay. Because of their long half-lives, such isotopes are still found on Earth in various quantities, and together with the stable isotopes they are called [[primordial element|primordial isotopes]]. All the primordial isotopes are given in order of their decreasing [[Abundance of the chemical elements|abundance on Earth]].{{ref label|Note3|c|c}}. For a list of primordial nuclides in order of half-life, see [[list of nuclides]].

118 [[chemical elements]] are known to exist. All elements to element 94 are found in nature, and the remainder of the [[List of chemical elements by their discovery|discovered elements]] are artificially produced, with isotopes all known to be highly [[radioactive isotopes|radioactive]] with relatively short half-lives (see below). The elements in this list are ordered according to the lifetime of their most stable isotope.&lt;ref name=nuclidetable&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/chart/|title=Interactive Chart of Nuclides|publisher=Brookhaven National Laboratory|author=Sonzogni, Alejandro|location=National Nuclear Data Center|accessdate=2008-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, three elements ([[bismuth]], [[thorium]], and [[uranium]]) are primordial because they have half-lives long enough to still be found on the Earth,{{ref label|Note4|d|d}} while all the others are produced either by [[radioactive decay]] or are [[synthetic element|synthesized]] in laboratories and [[nuclear reactors]]. Only 13 of the 38 known-but-unstable elements (assuming the total number of elements is 118) have isotopes with a half-life of at least 100 years. Every known isotope of the remaining 25 elements is highly radioactive; these are used in academic research and sometimes in industry and medicine.{{ref label|Note5|e|e}} Some of the heavier elements in the periodic table may be revealed to have yet-undiscovered isotopes with longer lifetimes than those listed here.{{ref label|Note6|f|f}}

About 338 nuclides are found naturally on Earth. These comprise 253 stable isotopes, and with the addition of the 33 long-lived radioisotopes with half-lives longer than 100 million years, a total of 286 [[primordial nuclide]]s, as noted above. The nuclides found naturally comprise not only the 286 primordials, but also include about 52 more short-lived isotopes (defined by a half-life less than 100 million years, too short to have survived from the formation of the Earth) that are daughters of primordial isotopes (such as [[radium]] from [[uranium]]); or else are made by energetic natural processes, such as [[carbon-14]] made from atmospheric nitrogen by bombardment from [[cosmic ray]]s.

==Elements by number of primordial isotopes==
An even number of protons or neutrons is more stable (higher [[binding energy]]) because of [[Semi-empirical mass formula#Pairing term|pairing effects]], so even-even [[nuclide]]s are much more stable than odd-odd. One effect is that there are few stable odd-odd nuclides: in fact only five are stable, with another four having half-lives longer than a billion years.

Another effect is to prevent beta decay of many even-even nuclides into another even-even nuclide of the same mass number but lower energy, because decay proceeding one step at a time would have to pass through an odd-odd nuclide of higher energy. ([[Double beta decay]] directly from even-even to even-even, skipping over an odd-odd nuclide, is only occasionally possible, and is a process so strongly hindered that it has a [[half-life]] greater than a billion times the [[age of the universe]].) This makes for a larger number of stable even-even nuclides, [[beta-decay stable isobars|up to three for some mass numbers]], and up to seven for some atomic (proton) numbers and at least four for all stable even-Z elements beyond [[iron]] except for [[strontium]].

Since a nucleus with an odd number of protons is relatively less stable, odd-numbered elements tend to have fewer stable isotopes. Of the 26 "[[monoisotopic element|monoisotopic]]" elements that have only a single stable isotope, all but one have an odd atomic number — the single exception being [[beryllium]]. In addition, no odd-numbered element has more than two stable isotopes, while every even-numbered element with stable isotopes, except for helium, beryllium, and carbon, has at least three.

==Tables==
The following tables give the elements with [[primordial nuclide]]s, which means that the element may still be identified on Earth from natural sources, having been present since the Earth was formed out of the solar nebula. Thus, none are shorter-lived daughters of longer-lived parental primordials, such as [[radon]]. Two nuclides which have half-lives long enough to be primordial, but have not yet been conclusively observed as such (&lt;sup&gt;244&lt;/sup&gt;Pu and &lt;sup&gt;146&lt;/sup&gt;Sm), have been excluded.

The tables of elements are sorted in order of decreasing number of nuclides associated with each element. (For a list sorted entirely in terms of half-lives of nuclides, with mixing of elements, see [[List of nuclides]].) Stable and unstable (marked ''decays'') nuclides are given, with symbols for unstable (radioactive) nuclides in italics. Note that the sorting does not quite give the elements purely in order of stable nuclides, since some elements have a larger number of long-lived unstable nuclides, which place them ahead of elements with a larger number of stable nuclides. By convention, nuclides are counted as "stable" if they have never been observed to decay by experiment or from observation of decay products (extremely long-lived nuclides unstable only in theory, such as tantalum-180m, are counted as stable).

The first table is for even-atomic numbered elements, which tend to have far more primordial nuclides, due to the stability conferred by proton-proton pairing. A second separate table is given for odd-atomic numbered elements, which tend to have far fewer stable and long-lived (primordial) unstable nuclides.

*{{note label|Note1|a|a}} See [[stability of technetium isotopes]] for a detailed discussion as to why technetium and promethium have no stable isotopes.
*{{note label|Note2|b|b}}Isotopes that have a half-life of more than about 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; yr may still be found on Earth, but only those with half-lives above 7×10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; yr (as of &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U) are found in appreciable quantities. The present list neglects a few isotopes with half-lives about 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; yr because they have been measured in tiny quantities on Earth. [[Uranium-234]] with its half-life of 246,000 yr and natural isotopic abundance 0.0055% is a special case: it is a decay product of [[uranium-238]] rather than a primordial nuclide.
*{{note label|Note3|c|c}}There are unstable isotopes with extremely long half-lives that are also found on Earth, and some of them are even more abundant than all the stable isotopes of a given element (for example, beta-active &lt;sup&gt;187&lt;/sup&gt;Re is twice as abundant as stable &lt;sup&gt;185&lt;/sup&gt;Re). Also, a bigger natural abundance of an isotope just implies that its formation was favored by the [[stellar nucleosynthesis]] process that produced the matter now constituting the [[Earth]] (and, of course, the rest of the [[Solar System]]) (see also [[Formation and evolution of the Solar System]]).
*{{note label|Note4|d|d}}While [[bismuth]] has only one primordial isotope, uranium has three isotopes that are found in nature in significant amounts ([[uranium-238|{{SimpleNuclide|uranium|238}}]], [[uranium-235|{{SimpleNuclide|uranium|235}}]] and [[uranium-234|{{SimpleNuclide|uranium|234}}]]; the first two are primordial, while &lt;sup&gt;234&lt;/sup&gt;U is radiogenic), and thorium has two (primordial [[thorium-232|{{SimpleNuclide|thorium|232}}]] and radiogenic [[thorium-230|{{SimpleNuclide|thorium|230}}]]).

*{{note label|Note6|f|f}}For elements with a higher atomic number than californium (with Z&gt;98), there might exist undiscovered isotopes that are more stable than the known ones.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4634">This is a '''list of active, dormant and extinct [[volcanoes]]''' located beyond planet [[Earth]]. They may be designated '''mons''' (mountain), '''patera''' (an irregular crater) or '''tholus''' (small mountain or hill) in accordance with the [[International Astronomical Union]]'s rules for [[planetary nomenclature]]. Many of them are nameless.

[[Image:Tvashtarvideo.gif|thumb|300px|right|Animation of eruption from [[Tvashtar Paterae]] (Io), taken from imagery from the [[New Horizons]] probe in 2007]]
[[Image:Tvastarpic2.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Lava flow at [[Tvashtar Paterae]]]]
[[Io (moon)|Io]], a [[Natural satellite|moon]] of the [[planet]] [[Jupiter]], is the most volcanically active body in the Solar System. Its volcanoes are believed to eject [[sulfur]] and [[sulfur dioxide]], as well as [[basalt]]ic and [[ultramafic]] silicate lavas.

==[[Mars]]==
{{See also|Volcanism on Mars|Category:Volcanoes of Mars}}
Mars has many [[shield volcano]]es, including the largest known volcano of the Solar System, but they are all dormant if not extinct.

==[[Venus]]==
{{See also|Volcanology of Venus|Category:Volcanoes of Venus}}
On Venus, volcanic features are very numerous and quite diverse, but, like on Mars, none is known to be currently active. These volcanoes range from several to several hundred kilometers in diameter; a majority of them are [[shield volcano]]es. In addition, Venus has unusual types of volcanoes: [[pancake dome]]s and [[scalloped margin dome]]s. Most small volcanoes on Venus are nameless.

==The [[Moon]]==
{{See also|Geology of the Moon|Lunar mare|List of maria on the Moon}}
Due to the low viscosity of most lunar [[lava]], volcanic mountains were seldom created. Instead, basaltic lava flooded large areas, which became [[lunar maria]]. [[Shield volcano]]es are known from a few areas on the Moon; they are called [[lunar dome]]s. Some areas of the Moon are covered with a usually dark coating, which is interpreted as [[pyroclastic rock|pyroclastic deposits]]. Sometimes they form a dark halo around [[rille]]s. See also:
* [[Lunar dome]]
* [[Mons Rümker]]
* [[Mons Hansteen]]

==Mercury==
{{See also|Mercury (planet)#Surface geology|Geology of Mercury}}
[[File:MESSENGER - BV Microsymposium49.jpg|thumb|Lava-flooded craters and large expanses of smooth volcanic plains on Mercury]]
Many of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]'s basins contain smooth plains, like the lunar mare, that are believed likely to be filled with lava flows. Collapse structures possibly indicative of volcanism have been found in some craters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/gallery/sciencePhotos/image.php?gallery_id=2&amp;image_id=127 MESSENGER views an intriguing crater] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131120010308/http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/gallery/sciencePhotos/image.php?gallery_id=2&amp;image_id=127 |date=2013-11-20 }}, NASA/Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory/Carnegie Institution of Washington, 2008-01-20.&lt;/ref&gt; Eleven volcanic domes were identified in Mariner 10 images, including a 1.4-km high dome near the centre of [[Odin Planitia]].&lt;ref&gt;Katterfeld, G. N. (1984). [http://www.springerlink.com/content/t713q4n28hk116u8/ Volcanism on Mercury], ''[[Bulletin of Volcanology]]'', Volume 47, Number 3, 531-535. {{DOI|10.1007/BF01961224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other planets and moons==
* [[Saturn]]'s moon [[Enceladus (moon)|Enceladus]] has geysers that spew water which have been photographed erupting by NASA's ''[[Cassini–Huygens]]'' spacecraft.
* Reports from NASA's ''Cassini–Huygens'' mission indicate that [[Saturn]]'s moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] probably has volcanoes that eject water ([[cryovolcano]]es).
* [[Triton (moon)|Triton]], a [[Natural satellite|moon]] of the [[planet]] [[Neptune]], has noncryovolcanic geysers that are believed to eject [[nitrogen]], dust, or [[methane]] compounds, as well as possible cryovolcanic features.
* [[Pluto]] has features that may be cryovolcanoes.

The '''list of seaweeds and marine flowering plants of Australia (temperate waters)''' is a list of marine species that form a part of the flora of [[Australia]].

The geographical range is from [[Perth, Western Australia]] to [[New South Wales]], and those tropical species which are also found in this range may also be listed here.

The listed organisms are generally identifiable to the naked eye. Many microscopic algae also inhabit this region.

Ranges are generally given relating to Australian waters. If listed as [[endemic]], they have been found only in the listed range. Others may have much greater ranges.

== Biographical information ==

Born in [[Moscow]], [[Russian SFSR]] to a Jewish family, her father was a plant physiologist and mother, a chemist. Ratner's mother was fired from work in the 1940s for writing to her mother in Israel, then considered an enemy of the Soviet state. Ratner gained an interest in mathematics in her fifth grade. She then studied at the [[Moscow State University]] in 1956 where she was inspired by [[Andrey Kolmogorov|A.N. Kolmogorov]] and his group.{{cn|date=October 2018}} Her graduate studies were under [[Yakov Sinai|Yakov G. Sinai]], also a student of Kolmogorov.&lt;ref&gt;{{MathGenealogy|id=32902}}&lt;/ref&gt; She emigrated from the Soviet Union in 1971 after obtaining a Ph.D. to Israel and taught at the Hebrew University 1971–1975. She began to work with [[Rufus Bowen]] at Berkeley and later emigrated to the United States and became a professor of mathematics at Berkeley.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.upi.com/Archives/1987/12/03/Soviet-refusenik-to-be-released/2923565506000/|title=Soviet refusenik to be released|last=Hartsock|first=John|date=1987-12-03|work=UPI|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her work included proofs of conjectures dealing with unipotent flows on quotients of Lie groups made by [[S.

The term '''model year''' in [[computer modeling]] is used for calculated equations describing one calendar year of data. If a [[climate model]], for example, is calculating the [[climate]] from 2015 to 2020, the computer has to calculate 5 model years, however it most likely takes much less time for the computer to do so.

The term is used in descriptions for models like [[climateprediction.net]], which has produced about 125 million model years of data until May 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.climateprediction.net |title= Climate prediction.net |accessdate=2011-05-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Norwegian Scientific Expedition to [[Tristan Da Cunha]]''' was a scientific and cultural exploration of the [[Extreme points of Earth|most remote]] inhabited [[archipelago]] in the world, in the south [[Atlantic Ocean]], 2,000 kilometres (1,200&amp;nbsp;mi) from the nearest inhabited land, [[Saint Helena]]. The expedition arrived on the island in December 1937 and left in March 1938.

==History==
Captained by botanist [[Erling Christophersen]], the thirteen man crew included three [[University of Oslo]] Ph.D. students conducting research for their dissertations, which were published shortly after their return; these included sociologist [[Peter A. Munch]], ornithologist [[Yngvar Hagen]], and [[phycology|phycologist]] [[Egil Baardseth]]. Also among the crew were a geologist, a marine biologist, an [[ichthyology|ichthyologist]], a dentist and a doctor. A late addition to the crew was topological surveyor [[Allan Bryant Crawford|Allan Crawford]], a British engineer who was recruited by the captain en route to [[Cape Town]], and who would later come to be regarded as a leading authority on Tristan Da Cunha.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Telegraph obituary: Allan Crawford|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1545199/Allan-Crawford.html|publisher=|accessdate=29 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on observations made during the voyage, Christophersen published ''Tristan da Cunha, the Lonely Isle'' (1938) and the comprehensive ''Norwegian Scientific Expedition to Tristan Da Cunha, 1937-1938'' (1945), while the Ph.D. students published their work and achieved their degrees. Munch published ''Sociology of Tristan da Cunha'' (1946), Hagen published ''Birds of Tristan da Cunha'' (1952), and Baardseth published ''The Marine Algae of Tristan da Cunha'' (1941).

The only nuclear transition suitable as a reference frequency is
the [[gamma decay]] of [[thorium-229m]], a [[nuclear isomer]] of
[[thorium]]-229 and the lowest-energy nuclear isomer known. The
transition is expected to be in the [[vacuum ultraviolet]], which
would make it accessible to laser excitation.

In 2016, the first direct detection of the isomeric transition has
constrained its energy to be between 6.3 and 18.3 [[Electronvolt|eV]].&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1943">'''Particle mass analyser''' is a measurement technique for classifying [[aerosol]] particles according to their mass-to-charge ratio.

Techniques exist for classifying (selecting) aerosol particles in the sub 1,000&amp;nbsp;nm range according to [[electrical mobility]] using devices such as differential mobility analysers.

==Electrical mobility==
In electrical mobility measurement, aerosol particles are classified according to their aerodynamic drag-charge ratio. If the particle is non-spherical, the electrical-mobility diameter will not correspond to any measurable physical dimensions of the particle. (For a spherical particle, the electrical-mobility diameter will correspond to physically measurable diameter.)

==Centrifugal particle mass analyzer==
An alternative technique classifies particles according to their [[mass-to-charge ratio]], using opposing electrical and [[centrifugal force]]s. This allows the classifier to select particles of a specified mass-to-charge ratio independent of particle shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ehara|title=Novel method to classify aerosol particles according to their mass-to-charge ratio - Aerosol particle mass analyser|journal=Journal of Aerosol Science|date=March 1996|volume=27|issue=2|page=217|doi=10.1016/0021-8502(95)00562-5|ref=1|display-authors=etal|bibcode=1996JAerS..27..217E}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{aquatic layer topics}}
The '''pelagic zone''' consists of the water column of the open ocean, and can be further divided into regions by depth. The word "pelagic" is derived {{ety|grc|''[[wikt:πέλαγος|πέλαγος]]'' (pélagos)|open sea}}. The pelagic zone can be thought of in terms of an imaginary cylinder or [[water column]] that goes from the surface of the sea almost to the bottom. Conditions differ deeper in the water column such that as pressure increases with depth, the temperature drops and less light penetrates. Depending on the depth, the water column, rather like the [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]], may be divided into different layers.

The pelagic zone occupies 1,330 million km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (320 million mi&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) with a mean depth of {{convert|3.68|km|mi|abbr=on}} and maximum depth of {{convert|11|km|mi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Costello |first1=Mark John |last2=Cheung |first2=Alan |last3=De Hauwere |first3=Nathalie |title=Surface Area and the Seabed Area, Volume, Depth, Slope, and Topographic Variation for the World's Seas, Oceans, and Countries |journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology |volume=44 |issue=23 |year=2010 |pages=8821–8 |doi=10.1021/es1012752 |bibcode=2010EnST...44.8821C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Charette |first1=Matthew |last2=Smith |first2=Walter |title=The Volume of Earth’s Ocean |journal=Oceanography |volume=23 |issue=2 |year=2010 |pages=112–4 |hdl=1912/3862 |doi=10.5670/oceanog.2010.51 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ouramazingplanet.com/oceans-depth-and-volume-revealed-0206/# Ocean's Depth and Volume Revealed] ''OurAmazingPlanet'', 19 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Fish that live in the pelagic zone are called [[pelagic fish]]. Pelagic life decreases with increasing depth. It is affected by light intensity, pressure, temperature, salinity, the supply of dissolved oxygen and nutrients, and the submarine topography, which is called [[bathymetry]]. In deep water, the pelagic zone is sometimes called the '''open-ocean zone''' and can be contrasted with water that is near the [[coast]] or on the [[continental shelf]]. In other contexts, coastal water not near the bottom is still said to be in the pelagic zone.

The pelagic zone can be contrasted with the [[benthic zone|benthic]] and [[demersal zone|demersal]] zones at the bottom of the sea. The benthic zone is the ecological region at the very bottom of the sea. It includes the sediment surface and some subsurface layers. Marine organisms living in this zone, such as [[clam]]s and [[crab]]s, are called [[benthos]]. The demersal zone is just above the benthic zone. It can be significantly affected by the seabed and the life that lives there. Fish that live in the demersal zone are called [[demersal fish]], and can be divided into [[demersal fish#Benthic fish|benthic fish]], which are denser than water so they can rest on the bottom, and [[demersal fish#Benthopelagic fish|benthopelagic fish]], which swim in the water column just above the bottom. Demersal fish are also known as [[bottom feeder]]s and [[groundfish]].

==Depth and layers==
[[File:Pelagiczone.svg|thumb|200px|A scale diagram of the layers of the pelagic zone]]

Depending on how deep the sea is, the pelagic zone can extend to five vertical regions in the ocean. From the top down, these are:

===Epipelagic (sunlight)===
{{See also|Photic zone|Epipelagic fish}}
''From the surface ([[Sea level|MSL]]) down to around {{convert|200|m|ft|abbr=on}}'' 

This is the illuminated zone at the surface of the sea where enough light is available for photosynthesis. Nearly all [[primary production]] in the ocean occurs here. Consequently, plants and animals are largely concentrated in this zone. Examples of organisms living in this zone are [[plankton]], [[Sargassum|floating seaweed]], [[jellyfish]], [[tuna]], many [[shark]]s and [[dolphin]]s.

===Mesopelagic (twilight)===
{{See also|Mesopelagic zone|pelagic fish#Mesopelagic fish}}
''From {{convert|200|m|ft|abbr=on}} down to around {{convert|1000|m|ft|abbr=on}}''

The most abundant organisms thriving into the mesopelagic zone are heterotrophic bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mazuecos | first1 = E. | last2 = Arístegui | first2 = J. | last3 = Vázquez-Domínguez | first3 = E. | last4 = Ortega-Retuerta | first4 = E.| last5 = Gasol | first5 = JM. |last6 = Reche | first6 = I.| year = 2012| title = Temperature control of microbial respiration and growth efficiency in the mesopelagic zone of the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans.| url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967063714001976| journal = Deep Sea Research Part I: Oceanographic Research Papers  | volume = 95 | issue = | pages = 131–138 |doi= 10.3354/ame01583 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of animals that live here are [[swordfish]], [[squid]], ''[[Anarhichadidae]]'' or "wolffish" and some species of [[cuttlefish]]. Many organisms that live in this zone are [[bioluminescence|bioluminescent]].&lt;ref name="marinebio.com"&gt;http://www.marinebio.com/Oceans/open-ocean.asp&lt;/ref&gt;  Some creatures living in the mesopelagic zone rise to the epipelagic zone at night to feed.&lt;ref name="marinebio.com"/&gt;

===Bathypelagic (midnight)===
{{See also|Bathyal zone|pelagic fish#Bathypelagic fish}}
''From {{convert|1000|m|ft|abbr=on}} down to around {{convert|4000|m|ft|abbr=on}}''

The name stems {{ety|grc|[[wikt:βαθύς|βαθύς]]|deep}}. At this depth, the ocean is pitch black, apart from occasional [[bioluminescence|bioluminescent]] organisms, such as [[anglerfish]]. No living plant exists here. Most animals living here survive by consuming the [[detritus]] falling from the zones above, which is known as "[[marine snow]]", or, like the [[marine hatchetfish]], by preying on other inhabitants of this zone. Other examples of this zone's inhabitants are [[giant squid]], smaller [[squid]]s and the [[grimpoteuthis]] or "dumbo octopus". The giant squid is hunted here by deep-diving [[sperm whale]]s.

===Abyssopelagic (lower midnight)===
{{Main article|Abyssal zone}}
''From around {{convert|4000|m|ft|abbr=on}} down to above the ocean floor''

The name is derived {{ety|grc|[[wikt:ἄβυσσος|ἄβυσσος]]|bottomless}} (a holdover from the times when the deep ocean, or [[abyssal zone|abyss]], was believed to be bottomless). Very few creatures live in the cold temperatures, high pressures and complete darkness of this depth.&lt;ref name="marinebio.com"/&gt; Among the species found in this zone are several species of squid; [[echinoderm]]s including the [[basket star]], swimming cucumber, and the [[Scotoplanes|sea pig]]; and marine arthropods including the [[sea spider]].&lt;ref name="marinebio.com"/&gt; Many of the species living at these depths are transparent and eyeless because of the total lack of light in this zone.&lt;ref name="marinebio.com"/&gt;

===Hadopelagic===
{{Main article|Hadal zone}}
''The deep water in ocean trenches''

The name is derived from the realm of [[Hades]], the [[Greek underworld]]. However, many organisms live in [[hydrothermal vent]]s in this and other zones. Some define the hadopelagic as waters below {{convert|6000|m|ft|abbr=on}}, whether in a trench or not.

==Pelagic ecosystem==
[[File:Sterna fuscata flight.JPG|thumb|200px|The pelagic [[sooty tern]] spends months at a time flying at sea, returning to land only for breeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{IUCN2008|assessor=BirdLife International|year=2008|id=144265|title=Sterna fuscata|downloaded=7 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The pelagic ecosystem is based on [[phytoplankton]]. Phytoplankton manufacture their own food using a process of [[photosynthesis]]. Because they need sunlight, they inhabit the upper, sunlit epipelagic zone, which includes the coastal or [[neritic zone]]. Biodiversity diminishes markedly in the deeper zones below the epipelagic zone as dissolved oxygen diminishes, water pressure increases, temperatures become colder, food sources become scarce, and light diminishes and finally disappears.&lt;ref&gt;Walker P and Wood E (2005) [https://books.google.com/books?id=O0GpAZsmrVAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=intitle:The+intitle:Open+intitle:Ocean&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=lBFnTfWTFYa8cIiz6Y0M&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''The Open Ocean''] (volume in a series called ''Life in the sea''), Infobase Publishing, {{ISBN|978-0-8160-5705-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pelagic birds===
{{See also|Seabird}}

'''Pelagic birds''', also called '''oceanic birds''', live on the open sea, rather than around waters adjacent to land or around inland waters. Pelagic birds feed on planktonic [[crustacean]]s, [[squid]] and [[forage fish]]. Examples are the [[Atlantic puffin]], [[macaroni penguin]]s, [[sooty tern]]s, [[shearwater]]s, and [[Procellariiformes]] such as the [[albatross]], [[Procellariidae]] and [[petrel]]s.

The term [[seabird]] includes birds which live around the sea adjacent to land, as well as pelagic birds.

===Pelagic fish===
{{Main article|Pelagic fish}}

'''Pelagic fish''' live in the [[water column]] of coastal, ocean, and lake waters, but not on or near the bottom of the sea or the lake. They can be contrasted with demersal fish, which live on or near the bottom, and [[coral reef fish]].&lt;ref name="Lal8"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lal|first1=Brij V.|authorlink1=Brij Lal (historian)|last2=Fortune|first2=Kate|title=The Pacific Islands: An Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T5pPpJl8E5wC&amp;pg=PA8|date=January 2000|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=978-0-8248-2265-1|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These fish are often [[fish migration|migratory]] [[forage fish]], which feed on [[plankton]], and the larger fish that follow and feed on the forage fish. Examples of migratory forage fish are [[herring]], [[anchovy|anchovies]], [[capelin]], and [[menhaden]]. Examples of larger pelagic fish which [[predation|prey]] on the forage fish are [[billfish]], [[tuna]], and oceanic [[shark]]s.

===Pelagic invertebrates===
Some examples of pelagic invertebrates include [[krill]], [[copepod]]s, [[jellyfish]], [[Decapodiformes|decapod]] [[larvae]], [[hyperiid]] [[amphipod]]s, [[rotifer]]s and [[cladocera]]ns.

[[Thorson's rule]] states that [[benthic]] [[marine invertebrates]] at low latitudes tend to produce large numbers of eggs developing to widely dispersing pelagic larvae, whereas at high latitudes such organisms tend to produce fewer and larger [[lecithotrophic]] (yolk-feeding) eggs and larger offspring.&lt;ref name="Thorson"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Thorson |first1=G |year=1957 |chapter=Bottom communities (sublittoral or shallow shelf) |title=Treatise on Marine Ecology and Palaeoecology |editor1-first=J.W. |editor1-last=Hedgpeth |pages=461–534 |publisher=Geological Society of America }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mileikovsky"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mileikovsky |first1=S. A. |title=Types of larval development in marine bottom invertebrates, their distribution and ecological significance: a re-evaluation |journal=Marine Biology |volume=10 |issue=3 |year=1971 |pages=193–213 |doi=10.1007/BF00352809 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pelagic reptiles===
''[[Pelamis platura]]'', the pelagic sea snake, is the only one of the 65 species of [[Hydrophiidae|marine snake]]s to spend its entire life in the pelagic zone. It bears live young at sea and is helpless on land. The species sometimes forms aggregations of thousands along slicks in surface waters. The pelagic sea snake is the world’s most widely distributed snake species.

Many species of [[sea turtles]] spend the first years of their lives in the pelagic zone, moving closer to shore as they reach maturity.

'''Recognition-primed decision''' ('''RPD''') is a model of how people make quick, effective [[decision making|decision]]s when faced with complex situations. In this model, the decision maker is assumed to generate a possible course of action, compare it to the constraints imposed by the situation, and select the first course of action that is not rejected. RPD has been described in diverse groups including Whitewater kayaking Trauma nurses, fireground commanders, chess players, commercial Whitewater river guides and  stock market traders. It functions well in conditions of time pressure, and in which information is partial and goals poorly defined. The limitations of RPD include the need for extensive experience among decision-makers (in order to correctly recognize the salient features of a problem and model solutions) and the problem of the failure of recognition and modeling in unusual or misidentified circumstances. It appears{{to whom?|date=May 2017}} to be a valid model for how human decision-makers make decisions.

==Overview==
The RPD model identifies a reasonable reaction as the first one that is immediately considered. RPD combines two ways of developing a decision; the first is recognizing which course of action makes sense, and the second, evaluating the course of action through [[imagination]] to see if the actions resulting from that decision make sense. However, the difference of being experienced or inexperienced plays a major factor in the decision-making processes. 

RPD reveals a critical difference between experts and novices when presented with recurring situations. Experienced people will generally be able to come up with a quicker decision because the situation may match a prototypical situation they have encountered before. Novices, lacking this experience, must cycle through different possibilities, and tend to use the first course of action that they believe will work. The inexperienced also have the tendencies of using [[trial and error]] through their imagination.

==Variations==
There are three variations in RPD strategy. In Variation 1, decision makers recognize the situation as typical: a scenario where both the situational detail and the detail of relevant courses of action are known. Variation 1 is therefore essentially an “If… then…” reaction. A given situation will lead to an immediate course of action as a function of the situation's typicality. More experienced decision makers are more likely to have the knowledge of both prototypical situations and established courses of action that is required for an RPD strategy to qualify as Variation 1. 

Variation 2 occurs when the decision maker diagnoses an unknown situation to choose from a known selection of courses of action. Variation 2 takes the form of “If (???)… then…,” a phrase which implies the decision maker's specific knowledge of available courses of action but lack of knowledge regarding the parameters of the situation. In order to prevent situational complications and the accrual of misinformation, the decision maker models possible details of the situation carefully and then chooses the most relevant known course of action. Experienced decision makers are more likely to correctly model the situation, and are thus more likely to more quickly choose more appropriate courses of action.

In Variation 3, the decision maker is knowledgeable of the situation but unaware of the proper course of action. The decision maker therefore implements a mental trial and error simulation to develop the most effective course of action. Variation 3 takes the form of “If… then… (???)” wherein the decision maker models outcomes of new or uncommon courses of action. The decision maker will cycle through different courses of action until a course of action appears appropriate to the goals and priorities of the situation. Due to the time constraint fundamental to the RPD model, the decision maker will choose the first course of action which appears appropriate to the situation. Experienced decision makers are likely to develop a viable course of action more quickly because their expert knowledge can rapidly be used to disqualify inappropriate courses of action.

==Application==
Recognition primed decision making is highly relevant to the leaders or officers of organizations that are affiliated with emergency services such as fire fighters, search and rescue units, police, and other emergency services. It is applied to both the experienced and the inexperienced, and how they manage their decision making processes. The Recognition primed decision making model is developed as samples for organizations on how important decisions can affect important situations which may either save lives or take lives. The model developed can be used as a study for organizations to fill in the gaps and to determine which type of RPD variation is more applicable to the organization.

A '''slide chart''' is a hand-held device, usually of paper, cardboard, or plastic, for conducting simple calculations or looking up information.
A circular slide chart is sometimes referred to as a wheel chart or [[volvelle]].

Unlike other hand-held mechanical calculating devices such as [[slide rules]] and [[addiator]]s, which have been replaced by electronic calculators and computer software, wheel charts and slide charts have survived to the present time. There are a number of companies who design and manufacture these devices.

Unlike the general-purpose mechanical calculators, slide charts are usually devoted to carrying out a particular specialized calculation, or displaying information on a single product or a particular process. For example, the "CurveEasy" wheel chart displays information related to spherical geometry calculations and the Prestolog calculator is used for cost/profit calculations.  Another example of a wheel chart is the [[planisphere]], which shows the location of stars in the sky for a given location, date, and time.

Slide charts are often associated with particular sports, political campaigns or commercial companies. For example, a pharmaceutical company may create wheel charts printed with their company name and product information for distribution to medical practitioners.

Slide charts are common collectables.

'''''The Fifth Discipline: The Art and Practice of the Learning Organization''''' {{Harv|Senge|1990}} is a book by [[Peter Senge]] (a senior lecturer at [[MIT]]) focusing on group problem solving using the [[systems thinking]] method in order to convert companies into [[learning organization]]s. The five disciplines represent approaches (theories and methods) for developing three core learning capabilities: fostering aspiration, developing reflective conversation, and understanding [[complexity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Gharajedaghi | first=Jamshid | author-link = Jamshid Gharajedaghi| year=1999 | title=Systems Thinking: Managing Chaos and Complexity | publisher=Burlington, MA: Butterworth-Heinemann | ISBN=0-7506-7163-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7N-sFxFntakC&amp;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Five Disciplines==
The five disciplines of what the book refers to as a "learning organization" discussed in the book are:

# "Personal mastery is a discipline of continually clarifying and deepening our personal vision, of focusing our energies, of developing patience, and of seeing reality objectively."&lt;ref name="senge-1990"&gt;
{{Citation| last=Senge | first=Peter M. | year=1990 | title=The Fifth Discipline | publisher=Doubleday/Currency | isbn=0-385-26094-6 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bVZqAAAAMAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# "[[Mental models]] are deeply ingrained assumptions, generalizations, or even pictures of images that influence how we understand the world and how we take action."&lt;ref name="senge-1990" /&gt;
# "Building shared vision - a practice of unearthing shared pictures of the future that foster genuine commitment and enrollment rather than compliance."&lt;ref name="senge-1990" /&gt;
# "[[Team learning]] starts with 'dialogue', the capacity of members of a team to suspend assumptions and enter into genuine 'thinking together'."&lt;ref name="senge-1990" /&gt;
# "[[Systems thinking]] - The Fifth Discipline that integrates the other four."&lt;ref name="senge-1990" /&gt;

Senge describes extensively the role of what it refers to as "mental models," which he says are integral in order to "focus on the openness needed to unearth shortcomings" in perceptions. The book also focuses on "team learning" with the goal of developing "the skills of groups of people to look for the larger picture beyond individual perspectives." In addition to these principles, the author stresses the importance of "personal mastery" to foster "the personal motivation to continually learn how [...] actions affect [the] world."&lt;ref name="senge-1990" /&gt;

==The Learning Disabilities==
In addition to "disciplines," which Senge suggests are beneficial to what he describes as a "learning organization," Senge also posits several perceived deleterious habits or mindsets, which he refers to as "learning disabilities."&lt;ref name="senge-1990" /&gt;

# "I am my position."
# "The enemy is out there."
# The Illusion of Taking Charge
# The Fixation on Events
# The Parable of the [[Boiling frog]]
# The Delusion of Learning from Experience
# The Myth of the Management Team

==The 11 Laws of the Fifth Discipline==
# Today's problems come from yesterday's "solutions."
# The harder you push, the harder the system pushes back.
# Behavior grows better before it grows worse.
# The easy way out usually leads back in.
# The cure can be worse than the disease.
# Faster is slower.
# Cause and effect are not closely related in time and space.
# Small changes can produce big results...but the areas of highest leverage are often the least obvious.
# You can [[have one's cake and eat it too|have your cake and eat it too]] ---but not all at once.
# Dividing an elephant in half does not produce two small elephants.
# There is no blame.

==Reception==
In 1997, ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'' identified ''The Fifth Discipline'' as one of the seminal management books of the previous 75 years.&lt;ref name="infed"&gt;[http://www.infed.org/thinkers/senge.htm The Fifth Discipline is one of his most popular books with over one million copies sold.  Peter Senge and the Learning Organization at the Infed Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis also reviewed the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Fifth Discipline: The Art and Practice of the Learning Organization {{!}} Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis|url = https://www.minneapolisfed.org/publications/the-region/the-fifth-discipline-the-art-and-practice-of-the-learning-organization|website = www.minneapolisfed.org|access-date = 2016-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Panda's Thumb: More Reflections in Natural History''''' (1980) is a collection of 31 essays by the [[Harvard University]] [[paleontologist]] [[Stephen Jay Gould]]. It is the second volume culled from his 27-year monthly column "This View of Life" in ''[[Natural History (magazine)|Natural History]]'' magazine.&lt;!-- what timespan for that column? for this selection? 
 --&gt;
&lt;!-- In typically discursive fashion, the book deals with themes familiar to Gould's writing 
 -- what a load of fluff --&gt;Recurring themes of the essays are 
evolution and its teaching, science biography, probabilities and common sense.

The title essay (of 1978, originally titled "The panda's peculiar thumb") presents the paradox that poor design is a better argument for evolution than good design, as illustrated by the [[anatomy]] of the [[panda]]'s "thumb"&amp;mdash;which is not a thumb at all&amp;mdash;but an extension of the radial [[sesamoid]]. Topics addressed in other essays include the female brain, the [[Piltdown Man]] hoax, [[Down syndrome]], and the relationship between dinosaurs and birds.

''The Panda's Thumb'' won the 1981 U.S. [[National Book Award]] [[List of winners of the National Book Award#Science|in Science]].&lt;ref name=nba1981&gt;
[https://www.nationalbook.org/awards-prizes/national-book-awards-1981 "National Book Awards – 1981"]. [[National Book Foundation]]. Retrieved 2012-03-07.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;
This was the 1981 [[List of winners of the National Book Award#Science|award for hardcover Science]]. 
&lt;br&gt;From 1980 to 1983 in [[National Book Awards#History|National Book Awards history]] there were dual hardcover and paperback awards in most categories, and [[National Book Award for Nonfiction#nonfiction categories|multiple nonfiction subcategories]]. Most of the paperback award-winners were reprints, including the 1981 Science.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1682">'''Web-based taxonomy''' is the effort by [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomists]] to use the [[World Wide Web]] in order to create unified, consensus taxonomies of life on Earth.

In his 2002 paper on the subject,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v417/n6884/full/417017a.html Godfray, H.C.J (2002). Challenges for taxonomy. ''Nature'' 417: 17-19]&lt;/ref&gt; [[H. Charles J. Godfray]] called for the creation of Web-based organisations to collect all the accumulated literature on a taxonomic group into a centralized knowledge base and make this data available through the Web as a unified taxonomy, so that it can be more easily examined and revised. Such a platform would be owned and maintained by a taxonomic working group, governed by an editor or an editorial board. An example of such a platform is [[FishBase]].

The notion of Web-based consensus taxonomies remains controversial because, as two Australian researchers pointed out,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = [[Kevin Thiele|Thiele, Kevin]] and David Yeates | year = 2002 | title = Tension arises from duality at the heart of taxonomy | journal = Nature | issue =   6905| doi = 10.1038/419337a | pages = 337 | volume = 419 | pmid = 12353005}}&lt;/ref&gt; taxonomic names are not fixed but hypotheses, and therefore in constant change.

[[File:ATSIII 10NOV67 153107.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The first color image of Earth, a composite of images taken in 1967 by the [[ATS-3]] satellite, was used as the cover image of ''Whole Earth Catalog''{{'}}s first edition.]]
The '''''Whole Earth Catalog'''''  ('''WEC''') was an American [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] magazine and product catalog published by [[Stewart Brand]] several times a year between 1968 and 1972, and occasionally thereafter, until 1998. The magazine featured essays and articles, but was primarily focused on product reviews. The editorial focus was on [[self-sufficiency]], [[ecology]], alternative education, [[DIY|"do it yourself" (DIY)]], and [[holism]], and featured the slogan "access to tools".  While WEC listed and reviewed a wide range of products (clothing, books, tools, machines, seeds, etc.), it did not sell any of the products directly.  Instead, the vendor's contact information was listed alongside the item and its review. This is why, while not a regularly published periodical, numerous editions and updates were required to keep price and availability information up to date.

==Origin==
[[File:Nuclear Environmentalist.jpg|thumb|Stewart Brand in 2010]]
The title ''Whole Earth Catalog'' came from a previous project by [[Stewart Brand]].  In 1966, he initiated a public campaign to have [[NASA]] release the then-rumored satellite photo of the sphere of [[Earth]] as seen from space, the first image of the "Whole Earth."  He thought the image might be a powerful symbol, evoking a sense of shared destiny and adaptive strategies from people.  The [[Stanford]]-educated Brand, a biologist with strong artistic and social interests, believed that there was a groundswell of commitment to thoroughly renovating American industrial society along ecologically and socially just lines, whatever they might prove to be.

Andrew Kirk in ''Counterculture Green'' notes that the ''Whole Earth Catalog'' was preceded by the "Whole Earth Truck Store". The WETS was a 1963 [[Dodge]] truck: In 1968, Brand, who was then 29, and his wife Lois embarked "on a commune road trip" with the truck, hoping to tour the country doing educational fairs.  The truck was not only a store, but also an alternative lending library and a mobile microeducation service.&lt;ref name=kirk48&gt;Andrew Kirk. ''Counterculture Green.'' (Lawrence: Univ. of Kansas, 2007):48.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kevin Kelly (editor)|Kevin Kelly]], who would edit later editions of the catalog, summarizes the very early history this way:

{{quote|'Here's a tool that will make drilling a well, or grinding flour, easier,' Brand would tell [the hippies,] pointing it out in his catalog of recommended tools. But his best selling tool was the catalog itself, annotated by him, featuring tools that didn't fit into his truck.&lt;ref name=kelly4&gt;Kevin Kelly, ''Cool Tools: A Catalog of Possibilities'', (Hong Kong, KK*, 2013): 4&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The "Truck Store" finally settled into its permanent location in [[Menlo Park, California|Menlo Park]], [[California]].&lt;ref&gt;John Markoff. ''What the Dormouse Said'', (New York, Penguin):154.&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead of bringing the store to the people, Brand decided to create "accumulatively larger versions of his tool catalog"&lt;ref name=kelly4 /&gt; and sell it by mail so the people could contact the vendors directly.

Using the most basic typesetting and page-layout tools, Brand and his colleagues created the first issue of ''The Whole Earth Catalog'' in 1968.  In subsequent issues, its production values gradually improved.  Its outsize pages measured 11×14 inches (28×36&amp;nbsp;cm).  Later editions were more than an inch thick.  The early editions were published by the [[Portola Institute]], headed by Richard Raymond. The so-called ''Last Whole Earth Catalogue'' (June 1971) won the first U.S. [[National Book Award]] in [[List of winners of the National Book Award#Current|category Contemporary Affairs]].&lt;ref name=nba1972&gt;
[https://www.nationalbook.org/awards-prizes/national-book-awards-1972 "National Book Awards – 1972"]. [[National Book Foundation]]. Retrieved 2012-03-09. &lt;br/&gt;There was a "Contemporary" or "Current" award category from 1972 to 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;
It was the first time a catalog had ever won such an award.  
Brand's intent with the catalog was to provide [[education]] and "access to tools" so a reader could "find his own inspiration, shape his own environment, and share his adventure with whoever is interested."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Whole Earth Catalog | date = Fall 1969 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[J. Baldwin]] was a young designer and instructor of design at colleges around the San Francisco Bay (San Francisco State University [then San Francisco State College], the San Francisco Art Institute, and the California College of the Arts [then California College of Arts and Crafts]). As he recalled in the film ''Ecological Design'' (1994), "Stewart Brand came to me because he heard that I read catalogs.  He said, 'I want to make this thing called a "whole Earth" catalog so that anyone on Earth can pick up a telephone and find out the complete information on anything. ... That's my goal.'"  Baldwin served as the chief editor of subjects in the areas of technology and design, both in the catalog itself and in other publications which arose from it.

True to his 1966 vision, Brand's publishing efforts were suffused with an awareness of the importance of [[ecology]], both as a field of study and as an influence upon the future of humankind and emerging human awareness.

==Organization==

From the opening page of the 1969 ''Catalog'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;
;Function

The WHOLE EARTH CATALOG functions as an evaluation and access device.  With it, the user should know better what is worth getting and where and how to do the getting.

An item is listed in the CATALOG if it is deemed:
# Useful as a tool,
# Relevant to independent education,
# High quality or low cost,
# Not already common knowledge,
# Easily available by mail.

CATALOG listings are continually revised according to the experience and suggestions of CATALOG users and staff.
;Purpose
We '''are''' as gods and might as well get good at it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pc.tedcdn.com/talk/stream/2017U/None/StewartBrandandChrisAnderson_2017U-320k.mp4#t=1473,1488|title=Mammoths resurrected, geoengineering, and other thoughts from a futurist|last=|first=|date=|website=[[TED (conference)|TED]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=January 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;   So far, remotely done power and glory—as via government, big business, formal education, church—has succeeded to the point where gross defects obscure actual gains.  In response to this dilemma and to these gains a realm of intimate, personal power is developing—power of the individual to conduct his own education, find his own inspiration, shape his own environment, and share his adventure with whoever is interested.  Tools that aid this process are sought and promoted by the WHOLE EARTH CATALOG.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The 1968 catalog divided itself into seven broad sections:

* Understanding Whole Systems
* Shelter and Land Use
* Industry and Craft
* Communications
* Community
* Nomadics
* Learning

Within each section, the best tools and books the editors could find were collected and listed, along with images, reviews and uses, prices, and suppliers.  The reader was also able to order some items directly through the catalog.

Later editions changed a few of the headings, but generally kept the same overall framework.

The ''Catalog'' used a broad definition of "tools."  There were informative tools, such as books, maps, professional journals, courses, and classes. There were well-designed special-purpose utensils, including garden tools, carpenters' and masons' tools, welding equipment, chainsaws, fiberglass materials, tents, hiking shoes, and potters' wheels. There were even early synthesizers and personal computers.

The ''Catalog'''s publication coincided with a great wave of convention-challenging experimentalism and a do-it-yourself attitude associated with "the counterculture," and tended to appeal not only to the intelligentsia of the movement, but to creative, hands-on, and outdoorsy people of many stripes. Some of the ideas in the ''Catalog'' were developed during Brand's visits to [[Drop City]].

With the ''Catalog'' opened flat, the reader might find the large page on the left full of text and intriguing illustrations from a volume of [[Joseph Needham]]'s ''Science and Civilization in China'', showing and explaining an astronomical clock tower or a chain-pump windmill, while on the right-hand page are a review of a beginners' guide to modern technology (''The Way Things Work'') and a review of ''The Engineers' Illustrated Thesaurus''.  On another spread,  the verso reviews books on accounting and moonlighting jobs, while the recto bears an article in which people tell the story of a community credit union they founded.  Another pair of pages depict and discuss different kayaks, inflatable dinghies, and houseboats.

==Books==
Three books were serialized in the pages of the WEC, printing a couple of paragraphs per page.  This made reading the catalog a page-by-page experience.
* ''[[Divine Right's Trip]]'' by [[Gurney Norman]], July 1971 edition
* ''Tales of Tongue Fu'' by [[Paul Krassner]], October 1974 edition
* ''The Rising Sun Neighborhood'' by [[Anne Herbert (writer)|Anne Herbert]], March 1981 edition

== Impact ==
[[File:NASA-Apollo8-Dec24-Earthrise.jpg|thumb|250px|''[[Earthrise]]'', by [[William Anders]], [[Apollo 8]], 1968, the cover photo of the second and third editions.]]
[[Steve Jobs]] compared ''The Whole Earth Catalog'' to Internet search engine [[Google]] in his June 2005 Stanford University [[commencement speech]]. "When I was young, there was an amazing publication called ''The Whole Earth Catalog'', which was one of the bibles of my generation ... It was sort of like Google in paperback form, 35 years before Google came along. It was idealistic and overflowing with neat tools and great notions." During the commencement speech, Jobs also quoted the farewell message placed on the back cover of the 1974 edition of the ''Catalog'': "Stay hungry. Stay foolish."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1R-jKKp3NA&amp;t=12m45s |title=Steve Jobs Stanford Commencement Speech 2005 |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2012-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jobs"&gt;[http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/2005/june15/jobs-061505.html Commencement address by Steve Jobs, delivered on June 12, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://htmlimg3.scribdassets.com/4988llwpkwmc54c/images/324-157e00fdae/000.jpg Back cover of the ''Whole Earth Catalog'' with its famous farewell message.]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kevin Kelly (editor)|Kevin Kelly]] made a similar comparison in 2008:

&lt;blockquote&gt;For this new [[counterculture of the 1960s|countercultural movement]], information was a precious commodity. In the '60s, there was no Internet; no 500 cable channels. [ ... The ''WEC''] was a great example of [[user-generated content]], without advertising, before the Internet. Basically, Brand invented the [[blogosphere]] long before there was any such thing as a [[blog]]. [ ... ] No topic was too esoteric, no degree of enthusiasm too ardent, no amateur expertise too uncertified to be included. [ ... ] This I am sure about: it is no coincidence that the ''Whole Earth Catalogs'' disappeared as soon as the web and blogs arrived. Everything the ''Whole Earth Catalogs'' did, the web does better.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Kelly: [http://kk.org/ct2/2008/09/the-whole-earth-blogalog.php The Whole Earth Blogalog] September 17, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Looking back and discussing attitudes evident in the early editions of the catalog, Brand wrote, "At a time when the [[New Left]] was calling for [[grassroots]] ''political'' (i.e., referred) power, ''Whole Earth'' eschewed politics and pushed grass-roots ''direct'' power—tools and skills."&lt;ref&gt;Winter 1998 edition of the ''Whole Earth Catalog'', p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

The broad interpretation of "tool" coincided with that given by the designer, philosopher, and engineer [[Buckminster Fuller]], though another thinker admired by Brand and some of his cohorts was [[Lewis Mumford]], who had written about words as tools.  Early editions reflected the considerable influence of Fuller, particularly his teachings about "[[systems theory|whole system]]s," "[[Synergetics (Fuller)|synergetics]]," and efficiency or reducing waste. By 1971, Brand and his co-workers were already questioning whether Fuller's sense of direction might be too anthropocentric.  New information arising in fields like ecology and biospherics was persuasive.

By the mid-1970s, much of the [[Buddhist economics]] viewpoint of [[E. F. Schumacher]], as well as the activist interests of the biological species [[Environmentalism|preservationist]]s, had tempered the overall enthusiasm for Fuller's ideas in the catalog.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} Still later, the amiable-architecture ideas of people like [[Christopher Alexander]] and similar community-planning ideas of people like [[Peter Calthorpe]] further tempered the engineering-efficiency tone of Fuller's ideas.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

An important shift in philosophy in the ''Catalogs'' occurred in the early 1970s, when Brand decided that the early stance of emphasizing individualism should be replaced with one favoring ''community''.  He had originally written that "a realm of intimate, personal power is developing"; regarding this as important in some respects (to wit, the soon-emerging potentials of personal computing), Brand felt that the overarching project of humankind had more to do with living within natural systems, and this is something we do in common, interactively.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

As an early indicator of the general Zeitgeist, the catalog's first edition preceded the original [[Earth Day]] by nearly two years.  The idea of Earth Day occurred to Senator [[Gaylord Nelson]], its instigator, "in the summer of 1969 while on a conservation speaking tour out west," where the [[Sierra Club]] was active, and where young minds had been broadened and stimulated by such influences as the catalog.

Despite this popular and critical success, particularly among a generation of young hippies and survivalists, the catalog was not intended to continue in publication for long, just long enough for the editors to complete a good overview of the available tools and resources, and for the word, and copies, to get out to everyone who needed them.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

== Publication after 1972 ==
After 1972 the catalog was published sporadically. Updated editions of ''The Last Whole Earth Catalog'' appeared periodically from 1971 to 1975, but only a few fully new catalogs appeared.  In 1974 the ''Whole Earth Epilog'' was published, which was intended as a "volume 2" to the ''Last Whole Earth Catalog''.  In 1980, ''The Next Whole Earth Catalog'' ({{ISBN|0-394-70776-1}}) was published; it was so well received that an updated second edition was published in 1981.

There were two editions in the 1980s of the ''Whole Earth Software Catalog'', a compendium for which [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] had bid $1.4 million for the trade paperback rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B06EFDA1738F931A15757C0A965948260 | work=The New York Times | title=Publishing: The Computer Software Race Is On | first=Edwin | last=Mcdowell | date=April 22, 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, ''The Essential Whole Earth Catalog'' ({{ISBN|0-385-23641-7}}) was published, and in 1988 the ''WEC'' was published on CD-ROM using an early form of hypertext developed by [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]] called ''[[HyperCard]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://wholeearth.com/issue/1290/article/342/a.brief.history.of.the.whole.earth.catalog | title = A Brief History of The Whole Earth Catalog | publisher = Whole Earth}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mania&gt;''[https://archive.org/details/CC501_hypercard Hypercard Mania!]''. [[Computer Chronicles]], 1987. [[Stewart Cheifet]] Productions (archive.org)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, there was a ''WEC'' dedicated to Communications Tools.  A ''Whole Earth Ecolog'' was published in 1990, devoted exclusively to environmental topics.  Around this time there were special ''WEC''s on other topics (e.g., ''The Fringes of Reason'' in 1989).

The last "full" ''WEC'', entitled ''The Millennium Whole Earth Catalog'' ({{ISBN|0-06-251059-2}}), was published in 1994.

A slender, but still on [[A3 paper]]. ''30th Anniversary Celebration WEC'' was published in 1998 as part of Issue 95 of the ''Whole Earth'' magazine ({{ISSN|0749-5056}}); it reprinted the original ''WEC'' along with new material.  An important aspect of this copy of the first ''WEC'' was a limitation placed on it by book publishers who "begged [''Whole Earth''] not to reprint the Catalog with their names anywhere near books they no longer carry".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scribd.com/doc/201033163/The-Whole-Earth-Catalog&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, all such information was placed at the back of the catalog.  This placement hampered a valuable function of the ''WEC'': nudging publishers to keep featured seminal works in print.

==Spin-offs and inspirations==
From 1974 to 2003, the Whole Earth principals published a magazine, known originally as ''[[CoEvolution Quarterly]]''.  When the short-lived ''[[Whole Earth Software Catalog and Review|Whole Earth Software Review]]'' (a supplement to ''The [[Whole Earth Software Catalog and Review|Whole Earth Software Catalog]]'') failed, it was merged in 1985 with ''[[CoEvolution Quarterly]]'' to form the ''[[Whole Earth Review]]'' (edited at different points by [[Jay Kinney]], 
[[Kevin Kelly (editor)|Kevin Kelly]], and [[Howard Rheingold]]), later called ''Whole Earth Magazine'' and finally just ''Whole Earth''.  The last issue, number 111 (edited by [[Alex Steffen]]), was meant to be published in Spring 2003, but funds ran out. The [[Point Foundation (environment)|Point Foundation]], which owned ''Whole Earth'', closed its doors later that year. {{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

The Whole Earth website&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.wholeearth.com/ | title = Whole Earth}}&lt;/ref&gt; continues the ''WEC'' legacy of concepts in popular discourse, medical self-care, community building, bioregionalism, environmental restoration, nanotechnology, and cyberspace.

Recognizing the "developed country" focus of the original WEC, groups in several developing countries have created "catalogs" of their own to be more relevant to their countries. One such effort was an adaptation of the WEC (called the "Liklik Buk") written and published in the late 1970s in Papua New Guinea; by 1982 this had been enlarged, updated, and translated (as "Save Na Mekem") into the [[Pidgin]] language used throughout Melanesia, and updates of the English "Liklik Buk" were published in 1986 and 2003.

In the United States, the book ''Domebook One'' was a direct spin-off of the WEC. [[Lloyd Kahn]], Shelter editor of the WEC, borrowed WEC production equipment for a week in 1970 and produced the first book on building [[geodesic domes]]. A year later, in 1971, Kahn again borrowed WEC equipment (an [[IBM Selectric typewriter#The Selectric as computer terminal|IBM Selectric Composer]] typesetting machine and a Polaroid MP-5 camera on an easel), and spent a month in the Santa Barbara Mountains producing ''Domebook 2'', which went on to sell 165,000 copies. With production of DB 2, Kahn and his company Shelter Publications followed Stewart Brand's move to nationwide distribution by [[Random House]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Kahn | first = Lloyd | title = The Birth of West Coast Publishing | journal = Whole Earth Review | date = Winter 1988 | page = 15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, Kirsten Grimstad and Susan Rennie are part of a research project at Berkeley University&lt;ref&gt;''Antioch University — Kirsten Grimstad, PhD'', https://www.antioch.edu/los-angeles/faculty/kirsten-grimstad-phd/&lt;/ref&gt; and publish a feminist catalog inspired by the Whole Earth Catalog, the [[New Woman's Survival Catalog]],&lt;ref&gt;''The New Woman's Survival Catalog'', 27 March 2012, http://feminismandgraphicdesign.blogspot.be/2012/03/new-womans-survival-catalog.html&lt;/ref&gt; which gathers feminist initiatives in different domains (art, communication, work, money, [[self-help]], self-defense…) in the USA.

In 1969, a store which was inspired by (but not financially connected with) ''The Whole Earth Catalog,'' called the [[Whole Earth Access]] opened in [[Berkeley, California]]. It closed in 1998. In 1970 a store called the "Whole Earth Provision Co.", inspired by the catalogue, opened in Austin, Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wholeearthprovision.com/about.php |title=Whole Earth Provision Co |publisher=Wholeearthprovision.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; It now has eight stores in Austin, Houston, Dallas, Southlake, and San Antonio.

In late 2006, [[Worldchanging]] released their 600-page compendium of solutions, ''Worldchanging: A User's Guide to the 21st Century'', which [[Bill McKibben]], in an article in the ''[[New York Review of Books]]'' called "The Whole Earth Catalog retooled for the iPod generation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Liu1dsizymcC&amp;pg=PA73&amp;lpg=PA73&amp;dq=The+Whole+Earth+Catalog+retooled+for+the+iPod+generation#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Whole%20Earth%20Catalog%20retooled%20for%20the%20iPod%20generation&amp;f=false |title=The New Village Green: Living Light, Living Local, Living Large – Stephen Morris – Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= 2013-10-18|accessdate=2012-12-01|isbn=9781550923445 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The editor of Worldchanging has since acknowledged the Catalog as a prime inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.plentymag.com/features/2006/11/a_world_of_good.php | title = A World of Good | journal = Plenty | date = November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.well.com/conf/inkwell.vue/topics/223/WorldChanging-com-Another-World-page01.html#post4 | publisher = The Well | title = WorldChanging.com: Another World is Here}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Whole Arctic Catalog'' was written by Pamela Richot and Published in ''Backet 3: At Extremes'' in 2015 to draw attention to threats to the arctic region specifically, similarly to how ''The Whole Earth Catalog'' drew attention to global environmental threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/852733851|title=At Extremes|last=|first=|publisher=|others=Przybylski, Maya,, Sheppard, Lola|year=2015|isbn=0989331768|location=Barcelona|pages=89–97|oclc=852733851}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarship==
[[Stewart Brand]] and ''The Whole Earth Catalog'' are both subjects of interest to scholars. Notable examples include works by [[Theodore Roszak (scholar)|Theodore Roszak]], [[Howard Rheingold]], [[Fred Turner (academic)|Fred Turner]], [[John Markoff]], Andrew Kirk, Sam Binkley and Felicity Scott. The  [[Stanford University Libraries and Academic Information Resources|Stanford University Library System]] has a ''Whole Earth'' archive in their Department of Special Collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/tf7n39n9ms | title = Guide to the Whole Earth Catalog Records, 1969–1986 (bulk 1974–1980) | publisher = CD Lib}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==

In 1970, on April Fool's Day, the Whole Earth Restaurant opened at [[UC Santa Cruz]]. It was an early source of "whole foods" in Northern California until it closed in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Donahue |first1=Louise |title=Whole Earth Restaurant Closes |url=http://www1.ucsc.edu/currents/02-03/07-22/restaurant.html |website=UCSC.edu |accessdate=10 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2010 issue of the political art magazine made by the [[Adbusters|Adbusters Media Foundation]] was titled ''The Whole Brain Catalog'', which features a parody cover with a small human brain in place of the earth, and many references to the 1960s counter culture movement. The tagline read ''Access to Therapies'' rather than ''Access to Tools''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = https://www.adbusters.org/magazine/90 | title = The Whole Brain Catalog | year = 2010 | volume = 90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 17, 2018 [[My Morning Jacket]] frontman [[Jim James]] announced the release of his third solo album ''[[Uniform Distortion]]'', which he stated was inspired by ''The'' ''Whole Earth Catalog.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/allsongs/2018/04/17/603048490/jim-james-decries-blanket-distortion-in-society-with-new-song-album|title=Jim James Decries Media Distortion In Society With New Song, Album|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-04-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Internet==
Kevin Kelly, mentioned above for his role in editing later editions of the ''Whole Earth Catalog'', maintains a web site—Cool-Tools.org—that publishes reviews of "the best/cheapest tools available. Tools are defined broadly as anything that can be useful. This includes hand tools, machines, books, software, gadgets, websites, maps, and even ideas."  He also published a large format book in 2013—''Cool Tools A Catalog of Possibilities''&lt;ref name=kelly4 /&gt;—which draws on the many reviews published over the years on that web site. The format, size, and style of the book reflect and pay homage to the original ''Whole Earth Catalog''.

* 1935 – [[Irène Joliot-Curie]] - [[artificial radioactivity]]
* 1911 – [[Marie Curie|Marie Sklodowska-Curie]] - discovery of [[radium]] &amp; [[polonium]]
Five women have won the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] (listed above), awarded annually since 1901 by the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]]. [[Marie Curie]] was the first woman to receive the prize in 1911, which was her second Nobel Prize (she also won the prize in physics in 1903, along with [[Pierre Curie]] and [[Henri Becquerel]] - making her the only woman to be award two Nobel prizes). Her prize in chemistry was for her "discovery of the elements radium and polonium, by the isolation of radium and the study of the nature and compounds of this remarkable element." [[Irene Joliot-Curie]], Marie's daughter, became the second woman to be awarded this prize in 1935 for her discovery of artificial radioactivity. [[Dorothy Hodgkin]] won the prize in 1964 for the development of [[Protein Crystallography|protein crystallography]]. Among her significant discoveries are the structures of [[penicillin]] and [[vitamin B12]]. Forty five years later, Ada Yonath shared the prize with [[Venkatraman Ramakrishnan]] and [[Thomas A. Steitz]] for the study of the structure and function of the [[ribosome]].
