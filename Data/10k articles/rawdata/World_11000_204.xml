'''AsiaCell Telecom Company''' ({{lang-ar|آسياسيل}}, {{lang-ckb|ئاسیاسێڵ}}) is an [[Iraq]]i [[telecommunications company]] that offers [[mobile phone]] services and [[Mobile Internet]] mainly in [[Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.investingroup.org/publications/kurdistan/overview/telecom/ Telecom - Kurdistan Region.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Asiacell, the first mobile telecommunications company in Iraq, was established in the city of [[Sulaymaniyah]] in 1999.

Asiacell began its first commercial operations in 2000.

In October 2003, Asiacell was granted a two-year GSM license for the six northern provinces of Iraq, catering in the process to a wider client base who collectively shared a need for a quality mobile network. The license was extended in 2005 to cover the entirety of the Iraqi Republic. Consequently, today it is the only telecom network to provide coverage nationwide.

In August 2007, Asiacell bid and won a 15-year national license, becoming the GSM telecom operator with the largest long-term network coverage in the country. The company's breakthrough successes have naturally led to its expansion and growth, thereby quickly reaching almost 2000 employees. The famous Kurdish singer [[Chopy Fatah]] became the cultural ambassador of the company in 2008. To handle new business operations, Asiacell also simultaneously established new executive offices in Baghdad, Mosul, and other major cities in Iraq,
 
Today, the company caters to more than 9.1 million subscribers around the country.

On February 2, 2013, Asiacell went public offering 25% of its equity, in an IPO that was considered the largest in the MEANA region since 2008.

In April 2015, the Iraqi legend of Arabic music [[Kadhim Al-Saher]] became representative of the brand.

'''Black metal''' is an [[extreme metal|extreme]] subgenre of [[heavy metal music]]. Common traits include [[Tempo#Beats per minute|fast tempos]], a [[Screaming (music)#Black metal|shrieking]] vocal style,&lt;ref name=metalsucks&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.metalsucks.net/2012/11/08/vons-satanic-blood-black-black-black-black-no-1/ | title=Von's Satanic Blood: Black Black Black Black No. 1 | publisher=[[MetalSucks]] | date=8 November 2012 | accessdate=8 May 2013 | author=O'Hagar, Sammy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=allmusic&gt;{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=inri-mw0000243175|pure_url=yes}} |title=((( I.N.R.I. &gt; Overview ))) |author=Rivadavia, Eduardo |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=2007-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sputnikmusic&gt;{{cite web|last=Freeman|first=Channing|title=Album Review - Darkthrone: A Blaze in the Northern Sky|url=https://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/54469/Darkthrone-A-Blaze-in-the-Northern-Sky/|publisher=[[Sputnikmusic]]|accessdate=22 January 2013|date=18 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; heavily distorted [[Electric guitar|guitars]] played with [[tremolo picking]], raw ([[Lo-fi music|lo-fi]]) recording, unconventional [[song structure]]s, and an emphasis on atmosphere. Artists often appear in [[corpse paint]] and adopt pseudonyms.

During the 1980s, several [[thrash metal]] and [[death metal]] bands formed a prototype for black metal.&lt;ref name="Stylus Magazine"/&gt; This so-called first wave included bands such as [[Venom (band)|Venom]], [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]], [[Mercyful Fate]], [[Hellhammer]] and [[Celtic Frost]].&lt;ref name=sam&gt;{{cite video |last=Dunn |first=Sam |year=2005 |title=[[Metal: A Headbanger's Journey]] |type=motion picture |publisher=Seville Pictures}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second wave arose in the early 1990s, spearheaded by [[Norway|Norwegian]] bands such as [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]], [[Darkthrone]], [[Burzum]], [[Immortal (band)|Immortal]], [[Emperor (band)|Emperor]], [[Satyricon (band)|Satyricon]] and [[Gorgoroth]]. The [[early Norwegian black metal scene]] developed the style of their forebears into a distinct genre. Norwegian-inspired black metal scenes emerged throughout Europe and North America, although some other scenes developed their own styles independently. Some prominent Swedish bands spawned during this second wave, such as [[Marduk (band)|Marduk]], [[Nifelheim]] and [[Dark Funeral (band)|Dark Funeral]].&lt;ref name=billzebub&gt;{{cite video |last=Debub |first=Bill |year=2007 |title=Black Metal: A Documentary |type=motion picture |publisher=Bill Zebub Productions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially a synonym for "Satanic metal",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McIver |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel McIver |title=Justice for All - The Truth About Metallica |edition=updated |publisher=Omnibus Press |year=2009 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SvW-uN-qEbIC&amp;pg=PT98&amp;dq=%22black+metal%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22black%20metal%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; black metal is intentionally separate from mainstream culture and this dissociation is often reciprocated, due to the actions and [[Black metal#Ideology|ideologies]] regularly associated with the genre. Many artists express extreme [[Anti-Christian sentiment|anti-Christian]] and [[Misanthropy|misanthropic]] views, advocating various forms of [[Satanism]] or [[Ethnic religion|ethnic]] [[paganism]]. In the 1990s, members of the scene were responsible for a spate of [[Black metal#Church burnings|church burnings]] and murders. There is also a small [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] [[National Socialist black metal|movement]] within black metal, although it has been shunned by many prominent artists.&lt;ref name=billzebub/&gt;&lt;ref name=kingovhell&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.maelstrom.nu/ezine/interview_iss50_224.php |title=Interview with Jotunspor |last=Škot |first=Mladen |work=maelstrom.nu |accessdate=4 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927131014/http://www.maelstrom.nu/ezine/interview_iss50_224.php |archivedate=27 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=infernus1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.Net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=93004 |title=Blabbermouth.net - Gorgoroth Guitarist Infernus: 'I Personally Am Against Racism in Both Thought and Practice' |date=15 March 2008 |work=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |accessdate=4 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422024415/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.Net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=93004 |archivedate=22 April 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, black metal strives to remain [[Underground music|underground]], inaccessible to the mainstream and those who are [[Poseur|not committed]].{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=30, 42}}

== Characteristics ==
Although ''contemporary black metal'' typically refers to the Norwegian style with shrieking vocals and raw production, the term has also been applied to bands with widely differing sounds.&lt;ref name=billzebub/&gt;&lt;ref name=emperor10&gt;''Emperor''. In: Jon Kristiansen: ''Metalion: The Slayer Mag Diaries''. Brooklyn, NY: Bazillion Points Books 2011, p. 274.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Instrumentation and song structure ===

Norwegian-inspired black metal guitarists usually favor high-pitched or [[Treble (sound)|trebly]] guitar tones and heavy [[distortion (guitar)|distortion]].{{sfn|Kahn-Harris|2007|p=4}} The guitar is usually played with fast, un-[[Palm mute|muted]] [[tremolo picking]].{{sfn|Kahn-Harris|2007|p=4}}&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite news |first=Chris |last=Campion |title=In the Face of Death |date=20 February 2005 |publisher=[[Guardian Unlimited]] |url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,11710,1419364,00.html |work=[[The Guardian|guardian.co.uk]] |accessdate=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chronicles&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chroniclesofchaos.com/Articles/rants/6-668_black_metal_a_brief_guide.aspx |title=CoC : Rant : Black Metal: A Brief Guide |last=Kalis |first=Quentin |date=31 August 2004 |work=[[Chronicles of Chaos (webzine)|Chronicles of Chaos]] |accessdate=4 September 2012 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/61ANsSfHb?url=http://www.chroniclesofchaos.com/Articles/rants/6-668_black_metal_a_brief_guide.aspx |archive-date=24 August 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Guitarists often use [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonance]]—along with specific [[Musical scale|scales]], [[Interval (music)|intervals]] and chord progressions—to create a sense of dread. The [[tritone]], or flat-fifth, is often used. [[Guitar solo]]s and low [[guitar tunings]] are rare in black metal.&lt;ref name=chronicles/&gt; The [[bass guitar]] is seldom used to play stand-alone melodies. It is not uncommon for the bass to be muted against the guitar,&lt;ref name=chronicles/&gt; or for it to [[Homophony|homophonically]] follow the low-pitched riffs of the guitar. While electronic keyboards were initially "not heard in [this] type of music", [[Dimmu Borgir]] say they started using keyboards "in the background" and then started using them as a "proper instrument" for creating "atmosphere".&lt;ref name="Patterson, Dayal 2013. p. 301"&gt;Patterson, Dayal. ''Black Metal: Evolution of the Cult''. Feral House, 2013.  p. 301.&lt;/ref&gt; Some newer black metal bands began raising their production quality and introducing additional instruments such as [[synthesizer]]s and even [[orchestra]]s.

The [[Drum kit|drumming]] is usually fast and relies on [[Heel-toe technique|double-bass]] and [[blast beat]]s to maintain tempos that can sometimes approach 300 beats per minute. These fast tempos require great skill and physical stamina, typified by black metal drummers Frost ([[Kjetil-Vidar Haraldstad]]) and Hellhammer ([[Jan Axel Blomberg]]).&lt;ref&gt;Sharpe-Young, Garry: ''Rockdetector A-Z of Black Metal'';  2001, Cherry Red Books, London, UK; p. i.&lt;/ref&gt; Even still, [[authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]] is still prioritized over technique. "This professionalism has to go," insists well-respected drummer and metal historian [[Fenriz]] (Gylve Fenris Nagell) of [[Darkthrone]]. "I want to ''de-learn'' playing drums, I want to play primitive and simple, I don't want to play like a drum solo all the time and make these complicated riffs".&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, Dayal: ''Black Metal: Evolution of the Cult''; 2013, Feral House, Port Townsend, Washington; p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt;

Black metal songs often stray from [[Song structure (popular music)|conventional song structure]] and often lack clear verse-chorus sections. Instead, many black metal songs contain lengthy and repetitive instrumental sections. The Greek style—established by [[Rotting Christ]], [[Necromantia]] and Varathron&lt;ref&gt;J. Campbell: [http://www.nwnprod.com/?p=2078 ''Varathron "Genesis of the Unaltered Evil" DLP/Triple LP and TS Out Now''], 30 January 2012, accessed on 13 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;—has more [[traditional metal|traditional heavy metal]]&lt;ref&gt;Chad Bowar: [http://heavymetal.about.com/b/2011/06/24/retro-recommendation-rotting-christ-thy-mighty-contract.htm ''Retro Recommendation: Rotting Christ - Thy Mighty Contract''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513034715/http://heavymetal.about.com/b/2011/06/24/retro-recommendation-rotting-christ-thy-mighty-contract.htm |date=13 May 2013 }}, 24 June 2011, accessed on 13 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[death metal]]&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Glas: ''Rotting Christ''.

=== Vocals and lyrics ===

Traditional black metal bands tend to favor raspy, high-pitched vocals which include techniques such as shrieking, screaming, and snarling,{{sfn|Kahn-Harris|2007|p=4}}&lt;ref name=chronicles/&gt; a vocal style influenced by [[Quorthon]] of [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]].{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=18f}} [[Death growl]]s, common in the [[death metal]] genre, are sometimes used, but less frequently than the characteristic black metal shriek.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The SAGE Handbook of Popular Music|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=2jPtBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT458#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher = SAGE|date = 2015-01-19|isbn = 9781473914407|first = Andy|last = Bennett|first2 = Steve|last2 = Waksman|page = 458}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Deleuze and Music|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=MkpsrsmYPv0C&amp;pg=PA107#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher = Edinburgh University Press|date = 2004-01-01|isbn = 9780748618699|first = Ian|last = Buchanan|first2 = Marcel|last2 = Swiboda|page = 107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Black metal lyrics typically attack Christianity and the other institutional religions,&lt;ref name=chronicles/&gt; often using apocalyptic language. [[Satanism|Satanic]] lyrics are common,&lt;ref name=murdermusic&gt;{{cite AV media|last=Dome |first=Michael |author-link=Malcolm Dome |year=2007 |title=Murder Music: Black Metal |type=motion picture |time={{time needed|date=October 2018}} |publisher=Rockworld TV}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many see them as essential to black metal. For Satanist black metal artists, "Black metal songs are meant to be like Calvinist sermons; deadly serious attempts to unite the true believers".{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=25}} [[Misanthropy]], [[global catastrophe]], war, death, destruction and rebirth are also common themes.&lt;ref name=murdermusic/&gt; Another topic often found in black metal lyrics is that of the wild and extreme aspects and phenomena of the natural world, particularly the wilderness, forests, mountains, winter, storms, and blizzards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marone|first=V.|year=2014|title=A Winterhorde in a Ravenrealm: Immortal’s lyrics as an expression of Northeroic Gothic|url=https://media.wix.com/ugd/c8fb40_5a122829af3a422fb718923030522f22.pdf|journal=Aeternum: The Journal of Contemporary Gothic Studies|volume=1 |issue=2|pages=40–60|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black metal also has a fascination with the distant past. Many bands write about the mythology and folklore&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Musical Style, Ideology, and Mythology in Norwegian Black Metal (Book chapter in: Metal Rules the Globe: Heavy Metal Music Around the World)|last=Hagen|first=Ross|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2011|isbn=|location=Durham, NC, USA|pages=180–199|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of their homelands and promote a revival of pre-Christian, pagan traditions. A significant number of bands write lyrics only in their native language and a few (e.g. [[Arckanum]]) have lyrics in archaic languages. Some [[doom metal]]-influenced artists' lyrics focus on depression, nihilism, introspection, self-harm and suicide.&lt;ref name=AE&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Ebner |first=Arne |date=25 July 2010 |title=Ästhetik des Doom |type=Bachelor |institution=Macromedia University of Applied Sciences for Media and Communication - Cologne |url=http://doom.resettheworld.com/aesthetik_des_doom_arne_ebner_40mb.pdf |access-date=18 August 2018 |language=German |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304075156/http://doom.resettheworld.com/aesthetik_des_doom_arne_ebner_40mb.pdf |archivedate=4 March 2016 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Vein&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sil|first1=Janet|editor1-last=Ishmael|editor1-first=Amelia|editor2-last=Price|editor2-first=Zareen|editor3-last=Stephanou|editor3-first=Aspasia|editor4-last=Woodward|editor4-first=Ben|title=Open a Vein: Suicidal Black Metal and Enlightenment|journal=Helvete: A Journal of Black Metal Theory|date=2013|issue=1|pages=5–19|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WNR9GGaUkTQC&amp;pg=PA5#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher=Punctum Books|location=Brooklyn|issn=2326-683X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Feral&gt;{{cite book|last1=Patterson|first1=Dayal|title=Black Metal: Evolution of the Cult|date=2013|publisher=Feral House|location=Port Townsend|isbn=9781936239757|page=351|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-kIxCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA351}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Imagery and performances ===

[[File:Hindvir Gaulhammer Fest 111008 01 C.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A common black metal convention is the use of corpse paint, black-and-white make-up intended to make the wearer look inhuman, corpse-like, or demonic. Shown here: Taalroth of French Pagan black metal band Hindvir.]]

Many bands choose not to play live.&lt;ref&gt;Marc Spermeth: ''Besessen von der Dunkelheit und dem Bösen''. In: ''Ablaze'', no. 5, May/June 1995, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=putrid&gt;Ben Ratliff: [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/15/arts/music/15metal.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all ''Thank You, Professor, That Was Putrid'']. In: ''[[The New York Times]]'', 14 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of those who do play live maintain that their performances "are not for entertainment or spectacle. Sincerity, [[Authenticity (philosophy)#In music|authenticity]] and extremity are valued above all else".{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=47}} Some bands consider their concerts to be rituals{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=47}} and often make use of stage props and theatrics. Bands such as [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]] and [[Gorgoroth]] are noted for their controversial shows, which have featured impaled animal heads, mock crucifixions, medieval weaponry and band members doused in animal blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article723414.ece |title=Aftenposten Norway, Norwegian news in English |last=Tisdall |first=Jonathan |date=4 February 2004 |work=aftenposten.no |accessdate=4 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309110157/http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article723414.ece |archivedate=9 March 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A few vocalists, such as [[Per "Dead" Ohlin|Dead]], [[Sven Erik Kristiansen|Maniac]] and [[Niklas Kvarforth|Kvarforth]], are known for [[Self-harm|cutting themselves]] while singing onstage.

Black metal artists often appear dressed in black with combat boots, bullet belts, spiked wristbands&lt;ref name=murdermusic/&gt; and [[Cross of St. Peter|inverted crosses]] and [[pentagram]]s to reinforce their anti-Christian or anti-religious stance.&lt;ref name=sam/&gt; However, the most stand-out trait is their use of corpse paint—black and white face paint sometimes mixed with real or fake blood, which is used to create a corpse-like or demonic appearance.

The imagery of black metal reflects its lyrics and ideology. In the early 1990s, most pioneering black metal artists had minimalist album covers featuring [[Xerox art|xeroxed]] black-and-white pictures and/or writing.&lt;ref name=billzebub/&gt; This was partly a reaction against death metal bands, who at that time had begun to use brightly colored album artwork.&lt;ref name=billzebub/&gt; Many purist black metal artists have continued this style. Black metal album covers are typically dark and tend to be atmospheric or provocative; some feature natural or fantasy landscapes (for example [[Burzum]]'s ''[[Filosofem]]'' and Emperor's ''[[In the Nightside Eclipse]]'') while others are violent, sexually transgressive, sacrilegious, or iconoclastic (for example [[Marduk (band)|Marduk]]'s ''[[Fuck Me Jesus]]'' and [[Dimmu Borgir]]'s ''[[In Sorte Diaboli]]'').

=== Production ===
The earliest black metal artists had very limited resources, which meant that recordings would often be done in homes or basements,{{sfn|Kahn-Harris|2007|p=4}} giving their recordings a distinctive "[[lo-fi]]" quality. However, even when success allowed access to professional studios, many artists instead chose to continue making lo-fi recordings.&lt;ref name=chronicles/&gt;&lt;ref name=murdermusic/&gt; Artists believed that by doing so, they would both stay true to the genre's underground roots as well as make the music sound more "raw" or "cold".&lt;ref name=murdermusic/&gt; A well-known example of this approach is on the album ''[[Transilvanian Hunger]]'' by [[Darkthrone]], a band who Johnathan Selzer of ''[[Terrorizer (magazine)|Terrorizer]]'' magazine says "represent the [[DIY]] aspect of black metal."&lt;ref name=murdermusic/&gt; In addition, lo-fi production was used to keep black metal inaccessible or unappealing to mainstream music fans and those who are [[Poseur|not committed]]. Many have claimed that black metal was originally intended only for those who were part of the scene and not for a wider audience.&lt;ref name=murdermusic/&gt; Vocalist [[Gaahl]] said that during its early years, "Black metal was never meant to reach an audience, it was purely for our own satisfaction".&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;

== History ==
The conventional history of black metal is that pioneers like [[Venom (band)|Venom]], [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]] and [[Hellhammer]] were part of a "first wave", and that a "second wave" was begun by the early Norwegian scene, especially by Mayhem vocalist, Dead's suicide;&lt;ref&gt;Enrico Ahlig: [http://www.metal-hammer.de/news/meldungen/article299447/marduk-gitarrist-besitzt-leichenteile-von-dead.html ''Marduk-Gitarrist besitzt Leichenteile von Dead''], 5 June 2012, accessed on 9 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Mayhem's leader, Euronymous, who founded the Norwegian scene after Dead's suicide;{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=39}} and Darkthrone's album ''[[A Blaze in the Northern Sky]]''.&lt;ref name=paganfront&gt;[[Hendrik Möbus]]: [https://web.archive.org/web/20071214012732/http://www.thepaganfront.com/pf.php?show=articles&amp;article=1 ''National Socialist Black Metal''], accessed on 2 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jon "Metalion" Kristiansen: [https://www.vice.com/read/saga-true-black-metal-v15n5 ''The Saga of True Norwegian Black Metal''], accessed on 2 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wolf-Rüdiger Mühlmann: ''Darkthrone''. ''A Blaze in the Northern Sky''. In: ''Rock Hard'', no. 269, October 2009, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; There are also some who argue that albums like [[Sarcófago]]'s ''[[I.N.R.I. (Sarcófago album)|I.N.R.I.]]''&lt;ref&gt;Mersus: ''5 Klassiker''. In: ''Rock Hard'', no. 269, October 2009, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Samael (band)|Samael]]'s ''[[Worship Him]]''&lt;ref&gt;sG: ''5 Klassiker''. In: ''Rock Hard'', no. 269, October 2009, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; began the second wave.

=== Roots ===
Occult and Satanic lyrical themes were present in the music of heavy metal and rock bands of the late 1960s and early 1970s such as [[Black Sabbath]] and [[Coven (band)|Coven]].&lt;ref name="Patterson, Dayal 2013. pp. 1-5"&gt;Patterson, Dayal. ''Black Metal: Evolution of the Cult''. Feral House, 2013.  pp. 1-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1970s, the form of rough and aggressive heavy metal played by the British band [[Motörhead]] gained popularity.&lt;ref name="Patterson, Dayal 2013. pp. 1-5"/&gt; Many first wave black metal bands would cite Motörhead as an influence.&lt;ref name="Patterson, Dayal 2013. pp. 1-5"/&gt; Also popular in the late 1970s, [[punk rock]] came to influence the birth of black metal.&lt;ref name="Patterson, Dayal 2013. pp. 1-5"/&gt; [[Tom G. Warrior]] of Hellhammer and Celtic Frost credited English music group [[Discharge (band)|Discharge]] as "a revolution, much like Venom", saying, "When I heard the first two Discharge records, I was blown away. I was just starting to play an instrument and I had no idea you could go so far."&lt;ref&gt;J. Bennett, "Procreation of the Wicked", ''Precious Metal: Decibel Presents the Stories Behind 25 Extreme Metal Masterpieces'', Albert Mudrian, ed., Da Capo Press, pp. 34f.&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of corpse paint in the black metal imagery was mainly influenced by the American 1970s [[rock music|rock]] band [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]].&lt;ref name="Patterson, Dayal 2013. pp. 1-5"/&gt;

=== First wave ===

[[File:Venom live at hellfest.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Venom's album titled ''[[Black Metal (album)|Black Metal]]'' inspired the name of the genre]]

The first wave of black metal refers to those bands during the 1980s who influenced the black metal sound and formed a prototype for the genre. They were often [[speed metal]] or [[thrash metal]] bands.&lt;ref name=sam/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sharpe-Young |first=Garry |title=Metal: The Definitive Guide |page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "black metal" was coined by the English band Venom with their second album ''[[Black Metal (album)|Black Metal]]'' (1982). Although deemed thrash metal rather than black metal by today's standards,&lt;ref name=murdermusic/&gt; the album's lyrics and imagery focused more on anti-Christian and Satanic themes than any before it. Their music was fast, unpolished in production and with raspy or grunted vocals. Venom's members also adopted pseudonyms, a practice that would become widespread among black metal musicians.

Another major influence on black metal was the Swedish band [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]]. The band, led by Thomas Forsberg (a.k.a. [[Quorthon]]), created "the blueprint for Scandinavian black metal".{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=21}} Not only was Bathory's music dark, fast, heavily distorted, lo-fi and with anti-Christian themes, Quorthon was also the first to use the shrieked vocals that came to define black metal.{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=18f}} The band played in this style on their first four albums: ''[[Bathory (album)|Bathory]]'' (1984), ''[[The Return……]]'' (1985), ''[[Under the Sign of the Black Mark]]'' (1987) and ''[[Blood Fire Death]]'' (1988). With ''Blood Fire Death'' and the two following albums, Bathory pioneered the style that would become known as [[Viking metal]].

In 1990 and 1991, Northern European metal acts began to release music influenced by these bands or the older ones from the first wave. In Sweden, this included Marduk, [[Dissection (band)|Dissection]], [[Nifelheim]] and [[Abruptum]]. In Finland, there emerged a scene that mixed the first wave black metal style with elements of death metal and [[grindcore]]; this included [[Beherit (band)|Beherit]], [[Archgoat]] and [[Impaled Nazarene]], whose debut album ''Tol Cormpt Norz Norz Norz'' ''Rock Hard'' journalist Wolf-Rüdiger Mühlmann considers a part of war metal's roots.&lt;ref name=rh307&gt;Wolf-Rüdiger Mühlmann: ''Impaled Nazarene''.

=== Second wave ===
{{Main|Early Norwegian black metal scene}}

[[File:Immortal Getaway Rock Festival.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Norwegian black metal band Immortal influenced countless bands in the black metal genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://heavymetal.about.com/od/immortal/p/immortal.htm |title=Immortal |publisher=[[About.com]] |last=Marsicano |first=Dan |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100602232143/http://heavymetal.about.com/od/immortal/p/immortal.htm |archivedate=2 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The second wave of black metal began in the early 1990s and was spearheaded by the Norwegian black metal scene. During {{nowrap|1990–1993}}, a number of Norwegian artists began performing and releasing a new kind of black metal music; this included [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]], [[Darkthrone]], [[Burzum]], [[Immortal (band)|Immortal]], [[Emperor (band)|Emperor]], [[Satyricon (band)|Satyricon]], [[Enslaved (band)|Enslaved]], [[Thorns (band)|Thorns]], [[Carpathian Forest]] and [[Gorgoroth (band)|Gorgoroth]]. They developed the style of their 1980s forebears into a distinct genre. This was partly thanks to a new kind of guitar playing developed by Snorre 'Blackthorn' Ruch of Stigma Diabolicum/Thorns and [[Euronymous|Øystein 'Euronymous' Aarseth]] of Mayhem.&lt;ref name=billzebub/&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt; Fenriz of Darkthrone described it as being "derived from Bathory"&lt;ref name=untilthelight&gt;{{cite video |year=2009 |title=[[Until the Light Takes Us]] |medium=motion picture |publisher=Variance Films}}&lt;/ref&gt; and noted that "those kinds of riffs became the new order for a lot of bands in the '90s".&lt;ref name=revolver&gt;Kory Grow: [http://www.revolvermag.com/uncategorized/web-exclusive-interview-darkthrones-fenriz-part-2-his-thoughts-on-transilva.html ''WEB-EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW: DARKTHRONE'S FENRIZ, PART 2! HIS THOUGHTS ON 'TRANSILVANIAN HUNGER' AND HIP''].&lt;/ref&gt;

The wearing of [[corpse paint]] became standard, and was a way for many black metal artists to distinguish themselves from other metal bands of the era.&lt;ref name=murdermusic/&gt; The scene also had an ideology and ethos. Artists were bitterly opposed to Christianity and presented themselves as misanthropic Devil worshippers who wanted to spread terror, hatred and evil.{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=27, 33, 41}} They professed to be serious in their views and vowed to act on them. [[Ihsahn]] of Emperor said that they sought to "create fear among people"{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=222}} and "be in opposition to society".{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=218f}} The scene was exclusive and created boundaries around itself, incorporating only those who were "true" and attempting to expel all "[[poseur]]s".{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=30, 42}} Some members of the scene were responsible for a spate of church burnings and murder, which eventually drew attention to it and led to a number of artists being imprisoned.

==== Helvete and Deathlike Silence ====
[[File:Helvete Oslo - black metal graffiti.jpg|thumb|200px|The basement of Helvete, showing graffiti from the early 1990s]]

During May–June 1991,{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=66}} Euronymous of Mayhem opened an independent record shop named ''Helvete'' ([[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] for ''hell'') in Oslo. It quickly became the focal point of Norway's emerging black metal scene and a meeting place for many of its musicians; especially the members of Mayhem, Burzum, Emperor and Thorns.&lt;ref name="Satan rir media"/&gt; Jon 'Metalion' Kristiansen, writer of the fanzine ''Slayer'', said that the opening of Helvete was "the creation of the whole Norwegian black metal scene".{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=39}} In its basement, Euronymous founded an [[independent record label]] named [[Deathlike Silence Productions]]. With the rising popularity of his band and others like it, the underground success of Euronymous's label is often credited for encouraging other record labels, who had previously shunned black metal acts, to then reconsider and release their material.

==== Dead's suicide ====
On 8 April 1991, Mayhem vocalist [[Per "Dead" Ohlin|Per Yngve Ohlin]] (who called himself "Dead") committed suicide while alone in a house shared by the band.&lt;ref name=onceuponatime&gt;{{cite video |year=2007 |title=Once Upon a Time in Norway |medium=motion picture |publisher=Another World Entertainment}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=purefucking&gt;{{cite video |year=2008 |title=Pure Fucking Mayhem |medium=motion picture |publisher=Index Verlag}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fellow musicians described Dead as odd, introverted and depressed. Before going onstage he went to great lengths to make himself look like a corpse and would cut his arms while singing.&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt; Mayhem's drummer, [[Jan Axel Blomberg|Hellhammer]], said that Dead was the first to wear the distinctive corpse paint that became widespread in the scene.&lt;ref name=basik&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thetruemayhem.com/interviews/previous/hh-june1998.htm |title=Interview with Hellhammer conducted by Dmitry Basik June 1998 |last=Basik |first=Dmitri |date=June 1998 |work=thetruemayhem.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823184104/http://www.thetruemayhem.com/interviews/previous/hh-june1998.htm |archivedate=23 August 2007 |accessdate=7 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was found with slit wrists and a [[shotgun]] wound to the head. Dead's suicide note apologized for firing the weapon indoors and ended: "Excuse all the blood".&lt;ref name=purefucking/&gt;{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=62}} Before calling the police, Euronymous got a disposable camera and photographed the body,{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=49}} after re-arranging some items. One of these photographs was later used as the cover of a bootleg live album, ''[[Dawn of the Black Hearts]]''.&lt;ref name=basik/&gt;

Euronymous made necklaces with bits of Dead's skull and gave some to musicians he deemed worthy.&lt;ref name=sam/&gt;&lt;!--this has been confirmed by others--&gt; Rumors also spread that he had made a stew with bits of his brain.&lt;ref name=murdermusic/&gt;&lt;ref name=onceuponatime/&gt; Euronymous used Dead's suicide to foster Mayhem's evil image and claimed Dead had killed himself because extreme metal had become trendy and commercialized.{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=59-60}} Mayhem bassist [[Necrobutcher|Jørn 'Necrobutcher' Stubberud]] noted that "people became more aware of the black metal scene after Dead had shot himself ... I think it was Dead's suicide that really changed the scene".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bromley |first=Adrian "The Energizer" |title=Mayhem: To Hell and Back |magazine=Unrestrained |issue=15 |url=http://www.thetruemayhem.com/interviews/previous/necro-unrestrained15.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823101847/http://www.thetruemayhem.com/interviews/previous/necro-unrestrained15.htm |archivedate=23 August 2007 |accessdate=7 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Church burnings ====
[[File:Bergen, Fantoft2.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The [[Fantoft stave church]] &lt;!-- Please add a picture of one of the churches burning, if possible --&gt;]]

In 1992, members of the Norwegian black metal scene began a wave of arson attacks on Christian churches. By 1996, there had been at least 50 such attacks in Norway.&lt;ref name="Satan rir media"/&gt; Some of the buildings were hundreds of years old and seen as important historical landmarks. The first to be burnt down was Norway's [[Fantoft stave church]]. Police believe [[Varg Vikernes]] of Burzum was responsible.&lt;ref name="Satan rir media"/&gt; The cover of Burzum's EP ''[[Aske (album)|Aske]]'' ("ashes") is a photograph of the destroyed church. In May 1994, Vikernes was found guilty for burning down [[Holmenkollen Chapel]], Skjold Church and [[Old Åsane Church|Åsane Church]].&lt;ref name=untilthelight/&gt;{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=93}} To coincide with the release of Mayhem's ''[[De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas]]'', Vikernes and Euronymous had also allegedly plotted to bomb [[Nidaros Cathedral]], which appears on the album cover. The musicians [[Faust (musician)|Faust]],{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=94f}} [[Samoth]],{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=141}} (both of Emperor) and [[Jørn Inge Tunsberg]] (of [[Hades Almighty]]){{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=141}}&lt;ref name="Satan rir media"/&gt; were also convicted for church arsons. Members of the Swedish scene started to burn churches in 1993.{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=269f}}

Those convicted for church burnings showed no remorse and described their actions as a symbolic "retaliation" against Christianity in Norway.{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=89}} Mayhem drummer Hellhammer said he had called for attacks on mosques and Hindu temples, on the basis that they were more foreign.{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=105}} Today, opinions on the church burnings differ within the black metal community. Many, such as Infernus and Gaahl of Gorgoroth, continue to praise the church burnings, with the latter saying "there should have been more of them, and there will be more of them".&lt;ref name=sam/&gt; Others, such as Necrobutcher and Kjetil Manheim of Mayhem and [[Abbath]] of Immortal,&lt;ref name=sam /&gt; see the church burnings as having been futile. Manheim claimed that many arsons were "just people trying to gain acceptance" within the black metal scene.&lt;ref name=onceuponatime/&gt; [[Watain]] vocalist Erik Danielsson respected the attacks, but said of those responsible: "the only Christianity they defeated was the last piece of Christianity within themselves. Which is a very good beginning, of course".&lt;ref name=blackmetalsatanica&gt;''Black Metal Satanica'', 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Please do not remove these tags --&gt;

==== Murder of Euronymous ====
In early 1993, animosity arose between Euronymous and Vikernes.{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=117}} On the night of 10 August 1993, Varg Vikernes (of Burzum) and Snorre 'Blackthorn' Ruch (of Thorns) drove from Bergen to Euronymous's apartment in Oslo. When they arrived a confrontation began and Vikernes stabbed Euronymous to death. His body was found outside the apartment with 23 cut wounds—two to the head, five to the neck, and sixteen to the back.&lt;ref&gt;Steinke, Darcey. "Satan's Cheerleaders". ''[[Spin (magazine)|SPIN]]''. February 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been speculated that the murder was the result of either a power struggle, a financial dispute over Burzum records or an attempt at outdoing a stabbing in Lillehammer the year before by Faust.&lt;ref name=ukcrlz&gt;{{cite web|last=Huey |first=Steve |url=http://music.yahoo.com/ar-257375-bio |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130105103704/http://music.yahoo.com/ar-257375-bio |dead-url=yes |archive-date=5 January 2013 |title=Mayhem Mayhem Biography on Yahoo! Music |work=yahoo.com |date=10 August 1993 |accessdate=24 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Vikernes denies all of these, claiming that he attacked Euronymous in self-defense. He says that Euronymous had plotted to stun him with an [[electroshock weapon]], tie him up and torture him to death while videotaping the event.&lt;ref name=untilthelight/&gt; He said Euronymous planned to use a meeting about an unsigned contract to ambush him.&lt;ref name=untilthelight/&gt;&lt;ref name=burzumstory2&gt;Vikernes, Varg: [http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/a_burzum_story02.shtml ''A Burzum Story: Part II - Euronymous'']. Burzum.org.&lt;/ref&gt; Vikernes claims he intended to hand Euronymous the signed contract that night and "tell him to fuck off", but that Euronymous panicked and attacked him first.&lt;ref name=burzumstory2/&gt; He also claims that most of the cuts were from broken glass Euronymous had fallen on during the struggle.&lt;ref name=burzumstory2/&gt; The self-defense story is doubted by Faust{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=123}} and other members of the scene.

Vikernes was arrested on 19 August 1993, in Bergen.{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=120}} Many other members of the scene were taken in for questioning around the same time. Some of them confessed to their crimes and implicated others. In May 1994, Vikernes was sentenced to 21 years in prison (Norway's maximum penalty) for the murder of Euronymous, the arson of four churches, and for possession of 150&amp;nbsp;kg of explosives. However, he only confessed to the latter. Two churches were burnt the day he was sentenced, "presumably as a statement of symbolic support".{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=141}} Vikernes smiled when his verdict was read and the picture was widely reprinted in the news media. Blackthorn was sentenced to eight years in prison for being an accomplice to the murder.{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=141}} That month saw the release of Mayhem's album ''De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas'', which featured Euronymous on guitar and Vikernes on bass guitar.&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt; Euronymous's family had asked Mayhem's drummer, Hellhammer, to remove the bass tracks recorded by Vikernes, but Hellhammer said: "I thought it was appropriate that the murderer and victim were on the same record".&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt; In 2003, Vikernes failed to return to Tønsberg prison after being given a short leave. He was re-arrested shortly after while driving a stolen car with various weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Berglund |first=Nina |date=27 October 2003 |title=Police Nab 'The Count' After He Fled Jail |newspaper=[[Aftenposten]] |url=http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article655724.ece |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070308164838/http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article655724.ece |archivedate=8 March 2007 |accessdate=5 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vikernes was released on [[parole]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Varg Vikernes ute på prøve |url=http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/artikkel.php?artid=557287 |newspaper=[[Verdens Gang]] |location=[[Oslo]], [[Norway]] |agency=[[Norsk Telegrambyrå|NTB]] |date=10 March 2009 |accessdate=5 September 2012 |language=Norwegian|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.vg.no%2Fnyheter%2Finnenriks%2Fartikkel.php%3Fartid%3D557287&amp;date=2009-03-10 |archivedate=10 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ute av fengsel |url=http://www.dagbladet.no/2009/05/22/nyheter/black_metal/varg_vikernes/6354526/ |work=dagbladet.no |date=22 May 2009 |accessdate=23 May 2009 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Outside Norway ====

[[File:Enthroned 201107 Paris 07.jpg|thumb|left|[[Enthroned]] is a black metal band from Belgium]]

Black metal scenes also emerged on the European mainland during the early 1990s, inspired by the Norwegian scene or the older bands, or both. In [[Poland]], a scene was spearheaded by [[Graveland]] and [[Behemoth (band)|Behemoth]]. In [[France]], a close-knit group of musicians known as [[Les Légions Noires]] emerged; this included artists such as [[Mütiilation]], [[Vlad Tepes (band)|Vlad Tepes]], Belketre and Torgeist. In [[Belgium]], there were acts such as [[Ancient Rites]] and [[Enthroned]]. Bands such as [[Black Funeral]], [[Grand Belial's Key]] and [[Judas Iscariot (band)|Judas Iscariot]] emerged during this time in the United States. [[Black Funeral]], from [[Houston]], formed in 1993, was associated with [[black magic]] and [[Satanism]].&lt;ref name="paganbelial.awardspace.com"&gt;[http://paganbelial.awardspace.com/?p=841 ''Black Funeral''.

[[File:Cradle of Filth 2005.jpg|thumb|right|250px|English black metal band Cradle of Filth performing at [[Metalmania]] in 2005]]

A notable black metal group in [[England]] was [[Cradle of Filth]], who released three demos in a black/death metal style with symphonic flourishes, followed by [[The Principle of Evil Made Flesh|a studio album]], which featured a then-unusual hybrid style of black and [[gothic metal]]. The band then abandoned black metal for gothic metal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Baddeley |first1=Gavin |last2=Filth |first2=Dani |authorlink2=Dani Filth |title=[[The Gospel of Filth]] |date=March 2010 |pages=48–50 |publisher=FAB Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; becoming one of the most successful [[extreme metal]] bands to date. John Serba of [[AllMusic]] commented that their first album "made waves in the early black metal scene, putting Cradle of Filth on the tips of metalheads' tongues, whether in praise of the band's brazen attempts to break the black metal mold or in derision for its 'commercialization' of an underground phenomenon that was proud of its grimy heritage".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-principle-of-evil-made-flesh-mw0000025519 |title=The Principle of Evil Made Flesh - Cradle of Filth |last=Serba |first=John |work=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=27 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some black metal fans did not consider Cradle of Filth to be black metal. When asked if he considers Cradle of Filth a black metal band, vocalist [[Dani Filth]] said he considers them black metal in terms of philosophy and atmosphere, but not in other ways.{{sfn|Partridge|Christianson|2014|p=42}} Another English band called Necropolis never released any music, but "began a desecratory assault against churches and cemeteries in their area" and "almost caused Black Metal to be banned in Britain as a result".{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=316-318}} Dayal Patterson says successful acts like Cradle of Filth "provoked an even greater extremity [of negative opinion] from the underground" scene due to concerns about "[[selling out]]".&lt;ref name="Patterson, Dayal 2013"&gt;Patterson, Dayal.

The controversy surrounding [[Absurd (band)|Absurd]] drew attention to the [[Germany|German]] black metal scene. In 1993, the members murdered a boy from their school, Sandro Beyer.{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=272}} A photo of Beyer's gravestone is on the cover of one of their demos,&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]]: ''Black Sun: Aryan Cults, Esoteric Nazism, and the Politics of Identity''.

In the beginning of the second wave, the different scenes developed their own styles; as [[Alan Averill|Alan 'Nemtheanga' Averill]] says, "you had the Greek sound and the Finnish sound, and the Norwegian sound".&lt;ref name=billzebub/&gt; By the mid-1990s, the style of the Norwegian scene was being adopted by bands worldwide, and in 1998, ''[[Kerrang!]]'' journalist [[Malcolm Dome]] said that "black metal as we know it in 1998 owes more to Norway and to Scandinavia than any other particular country".&lt;ref name="Satan rir media"&gt;{{cite video |title=[[Satan rir media|Satan Rides the Media]] |year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newer black metal bands also began raising their production quality and introducing additional instruments such as [[synthesizer]]s and even full-symphony [[orchestra]]s.

After Euronymous's death, "some bands went more towards the Viking metal and epic style, while some bands went deeper into the abyss".&lt;ref name=blackmetalsatanica/&gt; Since 1993, the Swedish scene had carried out church burnings, grave desecration and other violent acts. In 1995, [[Jon Nödtveidt]] of [[Dissection (band)|Dissection]] joined the [[Temple of the Black Light|Misanthropic Luciferian Order]] (MLO).&lt;ref&gt;Andrea Biagi: [https://archive.is/20031005065926/http://www.dissection.nu/biography.htm ''Biography Part One''.

The Swedish band [[Shining (Swedish band)|Shining]], founded in 1996, began writing music almost exclusively about depression and suicide, musically inspired by Strid and by Burzum's albums ''[[Hvis lyset tar oss]]'' and ''[[Filosofem]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sabine Langner: [http://www.legacy.de/index.php/stories/archiv/item/3639-shining ''Shining''.

[[File:Watain3.jpg|thumb|[[Watain]] singer Erik Danielsson in torn clothes and covered with blood]]
According to Erik Danielsson, when his band Watain formed in 1998 there were very few bands who took black metal as seriously as the early Norwegian scene had.&lt;ref name=blackmetalsatanica/&gt; A newer generation of Swedish Satanic bands like Watain and [[Ondskapt]], supposedly inspired by [[Ofermod]],&lt;ref&gt;Nathan T.

Kvarforth said, "It seems like people actually [got] afraid again".&lt;ref name=blackmetalsatanica/&gt; "The current Swedish black metal scene has a particularly ambitious and articulate understanding of [[mysticism]] and its validity to black metal. Many Swedish black metal bands, most notably Watain and Dissection, are [or were] affiliated with the Temple of the Black Light, or Misanthropic Luciferian Order […] a [[Theism|Theistic]], [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]], Satanic organization based in Sweden".{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=126}} Upon his release in 2004, Jon Nödtveidt restarted Dissection with new members who he felt were able to "stand behind and live up to the demands of Dissection's Satanic concept".&lt;ref name=faustleaves&gt;[https://archive.is/20040127040134/http://www.dissection.nu/faustleaves.htm ''FAUST LEAVES DISSECTION BECAUSE OF THE SATANIC CONCEPT''], accessed on 25 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; He started calling Dissection "the sonic propaganda unit of the MLO"&lt;ref&gt;[[Dissection (band)|Dissection]]: ''[[Live Legacy]]'', [[Nuclear Blast]] 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dissectioninterview2&gt;[https://archive.is/20071020061147/http://www.dissection.nu/interviews/Interview2.htm ''INTERVIEW FOR THE FANS BY THE FANS''.

A part of the underground scene adopted a [[Carl Jung|Jungian]] interpretation of the church burnings and other acts of the early scene as the re-emergence of ancient archetypes, which Kadmon of [[Allerseelen]] and the authors of ''[[Lords of Chaos (book)|Lords of Chaos]]'' had implied in their writings.{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=176f}}&lt;ref name=paganfront/&gt; They mixed this interpretation with Paganism and Nationalism.&lt;ref name=paganfront/&gt; Varg Vikernes was seen as "an ideological messiah" by some,&lt;ref name=decibelnsbm&gt;J. Bennett: [https://web.archive.org/web/20080208184453/http://www.decibelmagazine.com/features/may2006/nsbm.aspx ''NSBM Special Report''].&lt;/ref&gt; although Vikernes had disassociated himself from black metal&lt;ref name=decibelnsbm/&gt;{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=102}} and his neo-Nazism had nothing to do with that subculture.{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=102}} This led to the rise of [[National Socialist black metal]] (NSBM), which Hendrik Möbus of [[Absurd (band)|Absurd]] calls "the logical conclusion" of the Norwegian black metal "movement".&lt;ref name=paganfront/&gt; Other parts of the scene oppose NSBM as it is "indelibly linked with Asá Trŭ and opposed to Satanism", or look upon Nazism "with vague skepticism and indifference".{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=99}} Members of the NSBM scene, among others, see the Norwegian bands as [[poseur]]s whose "ideology is cheap", although they still respect Vikernes and Burzum, whom Grand Belial's Key vocalist Richard Mills called "the only Norwegian band that remains unapologetic and literally convicted of his beliefs".&lt;ref name=decibelnsbm/&gt;

In France, besides Les Légions Noires (The Black Legions), a NSBM scene arose. Members of French band Funeral desecrated a grave in [[Toulon]] in June 1996, and a 19-year-old black metal fan stabbed a priest to death in [[Mulhouse]] on Christmas Eve 1996.{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=312-315}} According to MkM of [[Antaeus (band)|Antaeus]], the early French scene "was quite easy to divide: either you were NSBM and you had the support from zine and the audience, or you were part of the black legions and you had that 'cult' aura".&lt;ref&gt;Ankit: [http://infernal-dominion.blogspot.de/2011/08/interview-with-mkm-from-antaeus-and.html ''Interview with MKM from Antaeus and Aosoth (French Black Metal)''], 23 August 2011, accessed on 31 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Many French bands, like [[Deathspell Omega]] and Aosoth, have an avantgarde approach&lt;ref&gt;Jan Jaedike: ''Merrimack''.

The early American black metal bands remained underground.

== Stylistic divisions ==

Regarding the sound of black metal, there are two conflicting groups within the genre: "those that stay true to the genre's roots, and those that introduce progressive elements".&lt;ref name=murdermusic/&gt; The former believe that the music should always be [[Minimalism|minimalist]]—performed only with the standard guitar-bass-drums setup and recorded in a [[low fidelity]] style. One supporter of this train of thought is [[Blake Judd]] of [[Nachtmystium]], who has rejected labeling his band black metal for its departure from the genre's typical sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailyherald.com/story/?id=208961 |title=Daily Herald &amp;#124; Nachtmystium shines black light on black metal |last=Pizek |first=Jeff |date=20 June 2008 |work=[[Daily Herald (Arlington Heights)|dailyherald.com]] |accessdate=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Snorre Ruch of [[Thorns (band)|Thorns]], on the other hand, has said that modern black metal is "too narrow" and believes that this was "not the idea at the beginning".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.voicesfromthedarkside.de/interviews/thorns.htm |title=Thorns |work=voicesfromthedarkside.de |accessdate=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1990s, different styles of black metal have emerged and some have melded Norwegian-style black metal with other genres:

{{dynamic list}}

===Ambient black metal===
Ambient black metal is a style of black metal which relies on heavy incorporation of atmospheric, sometimes dreamy textures, and is therefore less aggressive. It often features synthesizers or classical instrumentation, typically for melody or ethereal "shimmering" over the wall of sound provided by the guitars. The music is usually slow to mid paced with rare blast beat usage, without any abrupt changes and generally features slowly developing, sometimes repetitive melodies and riffs, which separate it from other black metal styles. Subject matter usually concerns nature, folklore, mythology, and personal introspection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/beautiful-brutality/Content?oid=1109755|title = Beautiful Brutality|date = 22 May 2008|accessdate = 14 March 2015|website = [[Chicago Reader]]|publisher = [[Wrapports]]|last = Raymer|first = Miles}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artists include [[Agalloch]]&lt;ref name="ABM"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://exclaim.ca/Music/article/agalloch-reluctant_kings|title = Agalloch Reluctant Kings|date = 23 May 2014|accessdate = 18 June 2015|website = Exclaim!|last = Walschots|first = Natalie}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Wolves in the Throne Room]].&lt;ref name="ABM"/&gt;

== Ideology ==
[[File:Taake Hellfest 2009 8 NB.jpg|thumb|left|175px|[[Taake]] vocalist Hoest—the [[Cross of St. Peter|inverted Christian cross]] is often used by black-metallers to signify their opposition to Christianity]]

Unlike other metal genres, black metal is associated with an ideology and ethos. It is fiercely [[anti-Christian sentiment|opposed to Christianity]]&lt;ref name=sam/&gt; and the other main [[Organized religion|institutional religions]], [[Criticism of Islam|Islam]] and [[Criticism of Judaism|Judaism]]. Many black metal bands are [[Satanism|Satanists]] and see Satanism as a key part of black metal. Others advocate ethnic Paganism, "often coupled with nationalism",{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=359}} although the early Pagan bands did not call themselves 'black metal'.&lt;ref name=halupczok/&gt;&lt;ref name=enslavedfrost/&gt;&lt;ref name=nordicmetal/&gt;

Black metal tends to be [[Misanthropy|misanthropic]] and hostile to modern society.&lt;ref name=murdermusic/&gt; It is "a reaction against the mundanity, insincerity and emotional emptiness that participants feel is intrinsic to modern secular culture".{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=37}} The black metal scene tends to oppose [[political correctness]], [[humanitarianism]], [[consumerism]], [[globalization]] and homogeneity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Murphy |first=David |editor=Ullrich Kockel |title=A Companion to the Anthropology of Europe |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |date=2012 |pages=437 |chapter=Chapter 25: Extreme Neo-nationalist Music Scenes at the Heart of Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |ref=harv |last=Manea |first=Irina-Maria |date=16 April 2015 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HzcnCAAAQBAJ |title=Primal Roots: Ancestry and Race in Extreme Music Discourses |journal=Proceedings of IAC-SSaH 2015: International Academic Conference on Social Sciences and Humanities in Prague 2015 |publisher=Czech Institute of Academic Education |pages=186–187, 190 |isbn=9788090579125 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Noys |first=Benjamin |editor=Nicola Masciandaro |title=Hideous Gnosis: Black Metal Theory Symposium |publisher=Glossator |date=2010 |pages=106–108 |chapter='Remain True to the Earth!': Remarks on the Politics of Black Metal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aaron Weaver from [[Wolves in the Throne Room]] said: "black metal is an artistic movement that is critiquing modernity on a fundamental level, saying that the modern world view is missing something".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2009/05/an_interview_w_13.html |title=An Interview w/ Wolves in the Throne Room's Aaron Weaver |date=22 May 2009 |work=brooklynvegan.com |accessdate=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of this, black metal glorifies nature and has a fascination with the distant past.{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=2}}&lt;ref name=chonicles&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chroniclesofchaos.com/articles/rants/6-668_black_metal_a_brief_guide.aspx |title=CoC : Rant : Black Metal: A Brief Guide |last=Kalis |first=Quentin |date=31 August 2004 |work=[[Chronicles of Chaos (webzine)|Chronicles of Chaos]] |accessdate=4 September 2012 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/61ANsSfHb?url=http://www.chroniclesofchaos.com/Articles/rants/6-668_black_metal_a_brief_guide.aspx |archive-date=24 August 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been likened to [[Romanticism]] and there is an undercurrent of [[romantic nationalism]] in the genre.&lt;ref&gt;Van Young, Adrian.

However, it is argued that followers of Euronymous were anti-individualistic,{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=27f}} and that "Black Metal is characterized by a conflict between radical individualism and group identity and by an attempt to accept both polarities simultaneously".{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=2}}

In his master's thesis, Benjamin Hedge Olson wrote that some artists can be seen as [[Transcendentalism|transcendentalists]]. Dissatisfied with a "world that they feel is devoid of spiritual and cultural significance",{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=129}} they try to leave or "transcend" their "mundane physical forms" and become one with the divine.{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=4}} This is done through their concerts, which he describes as "musical rituals" that involve self-mortification and taking on an alternative, "spiritual persona" (for example by the wearing of costume and face paint).{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=50}}

=== Satanism ===
[[File:Pentagram4.svg|thumb|150px|right|The [[pentagram]] is commonly used by bands in the genre]]

Black metal was originally a term for extreme metal bands with Satanic lyrics and imagery. However, most of the 'first wave' bands (including Venom, who coined the term 'black metal') were not Satanists and rather used Satanic themes to provoke controversy or gain attention. One of the few exceptions was [[Mercyful Fate]] singer and [[Church of Satan]] member [[King Diamond]], whom [[Michael Moynihan (journalist)|Michael Moynihan]] calls "one of the only performers of the '80s Satanic metal who was more than just a [[poseur]] using a devilish image for [[shock value]]".{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=16}}

[[File:Gorgoroth by Christian Misje.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Video shoot for "Carving a Giant" by Gorgoroth, which features mock crucifixions]]

In the early 1990s, many Norwegian black-metallers presented themselves as genuine Devil worshippers.{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=7f}} Mayhem's Euronymous was the key figure behind this.{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=27f}} They attacked the Church of Satan for its "freedom and life-loving" views;&lt;ref name=killyourself2&gt;Esa Lahdenpera: [https://web.archive.org/web/20120207234358/http://www.fmp666.com/moonlight/mayhem.html ''Northern Black Metal Legends'']. In: ''Kill Yourself'', no. 2, August 1993. Retrieved 30 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[theistic Satanism]] they espoused was an inversion of Christianity. Benjamin Hedge Olson wrote that they "transform[ed] Venom's quasi-Satanic stage theatrics into a form of cultural expression unique from other forms of metal or Satanism" and "abandoned the mundane identities and ambitions of other forms of metal in favor of religious and ideological fanaticism".{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=27f}} Some prominent scene members—such as Euronymous and Faust&lt;ref name=emperor10/&gt;&lt;ref name=killyourself/&gt;—stated that only bands who are Satanists can be called 'black metal'. Bands with a Norwegian style, but without Satanic lyrics, tended to use other names for their music.&lt;ref name=halupczok&gt;{{cite journal |last=Halupczok |first=Marc |title=Waldschrate &amp; Met-Trinker |magazine=[[Metal Hammer]] |date=March 2010 |page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=enslavedfrost&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Frost (album)|Frost]] |type=CD liner notes |publisher=[[Osmose Productions]] |year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nordicmetal&gt;{{cite book |title=Nordic Metal – A Tribute to Euronymous |type=CD liner notes |publisher=[[Necropolis Records]] |year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view is still held by many artists—such as [[Infernus]],&lt;ref name=infernus&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.live-metal.net/features_interviews_infernus_gorgoroth.html |title=live-metal.net - Interviews: Gorgoroth - Infernus |last=Maki |first=Jeff |date=18 July 2006 |work=live-metal.net |accessdate=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Daniel Rostén|Arioch]],&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Rape: ''Funeral Mist''.

====National Socialist black metal====
{{main|National Socialist black metal}}
National Socialist black metal (also known as NSBM) promotes [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] or similar beliefs through its lyrics and imagery. Artists typically meld neo-Nazi ideology with ethnic European paganism, but a few meld these beliefs with Satanism or occultism. Some commentators see this ideology as a natural development of the black metal worldview. Members of the early Norwegian scene flirted with Nazi themes, but this was largely an attempt to provoke.{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=101}} Varg Vikernes—who now refers to his ideology as '[[Odalism]]'&lt;ref name=burzum.org&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/a_burzum_story07.shtml |title=A Burzum Story: Part VII - The Nazi Ghost |last=Vikernes |first=Varg |authorlink=Varg Vikernes |date=July 2005 |work=burzum.org |accessdate=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;—is credited with popularizing such views within the scene.{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=303}}{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=103}} NSBM emerged in the mid-1990s and was spearheaded by artists such as [[Absurd (band)|Absurd]] (from Germany), [[Graveland]], [[Infernum]] and Veles (from Poland), Branikald (from Russia) and [[Grand Belial's Key]] (from the US). It is particularly strong in the former [[Eastern Bloc]]. There are dozens of NSBM bands, several independent record labels and zines devoted to NSBM, and festivals associated with it. Some black metal bands have been wrongly labeled as NSBM for exploring Nazi Germany in their lyrics or referencing it for shock value.

'[[Unblack metal]]' (or 'Christian black metal') promotes Christianity through its lyrics and imagery.&lt;ref name=kapelovitz&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kapelovitz |first=Dan |date=February 2001 |title=Heavy Metal Jesus Freaks - Headbanging for Christ |journal=Mean Magazine |url=http://www.kapelovitz.com/christianmetal.htm |accessdate=6 September 2007 |quote=And where secular black metal thrived, so did its Christian counterpart, unblack metal, with names like [[Satanicide]], Neversatan, and Satan's Doom. |ref=harv |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070805040049/http://www.kapelovitz.com/christianmetal.htm |archivedate=5 August 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first unblack metal record, ''[[Hellig Usvart]]'' (1994) by Australian artist [[Horde (band)|Horde]], was a provocative parody of Norwegian black metal. It sparked controversy, and death threats were issued against Horde. Norwegian Christian band [[Antestor]] adopted a black metal style in the late 1990s.

Many black-metallers see "Christian black metal" as an oxymoron&lt;ref name=ultimatemetal/&gt; and believe black metal cannot be Christian.&lt;ref name=murdermusic/&gt; In fact, the early unblack metal groups Horde and Antestor refused to call their music "black metal" because they did not share its ethos. Horde called its music "holy unblack metal"&lt;ref name=Erasmus&gt;{{cite web |url=http://unblack.d135-1r43.de/hordeint/hordeinterview.html |title=Horde Interview |accessdate=9 December 2007 |author=Erasmus |year=2006 |publisher=Unblack.de |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023175915/http://unblack.d135-1r43.de/hordeint/hordeinterview.html |archivedate=23 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Antestor called theirs "sorrow metal".&lt;ref name=Morrow&gt;{{cite web |author=Morrow, Matt |title=Antestor - The Return of the Black Death |publisher=Open Publishing |year=2001 |work=The Whipping Post |url=http://thewhippingpost.tripod.com/antestorthereturnoftheblackdeath/ |accessdate=6 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Horde's [[Jayson Sherlock]] later said "I will never understand why Christians think they can play Black Metal.

The '''Ceretani''' (or '''Cerretani''')  were ancient people of possibly [[Iberians|Iberian]] origin, who occupied the current [[Cerdanya]] (from which derives the name), overall the valley [[Segre River|Segre]] and part of [[Aragon]]. Their neighbours from the east were [[Ausetani]] and from the south [[Ilergetes]]. Their main town was Julia libyca ([[Llívia]]).

Their capital was located most probably on the place of modern [[Castellciutat]].

After Cherry Boom disbanded, Lena Cha started her solo project Astro Bunny (原子邦妮) with bassist/producer Jay Cheng (程杰). Astro Bunny performed their first concert on 13 June 2012, at the Riverside Cafe (河岸留言) in Taipei and released their debut five-track EP "What If There’s No Tomorrow" the same month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.easternodyssey.com/up-and-coming/item/403-lena-cha-ex-cherry-boom-returns-with-new-band-astro-bunny|title=Lena Cha ex-Cherry Boom Returns with New band Astro Bunny|date=28 June 2012|work=East Odyssey Music|accessdate=8 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with the ''[[Taipei Times]]'', Cha said, "We named the group ‘bunny’ because I love bunnies and I forced him to like them too," Cha laughed. "I picked the word "astro" because I’m an anime and computer game geek".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2012/06/08/2003534784|title=Arts &amp; Culture: Parallel universe|date=8 June 2012|accessdate=8 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1368">The '''Coalition for International Justice''' (CIJ) was an international, [[non-profit]] organization based in both [[Washington D.C.]] and [[The Hague]] that supported the international [[war crimes]] [[tribunals]] for [[Rwanda]] and the former [[Yugoslavia]], and criminal and transitional justice initiatives for [[East Timor]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Cambodia]], and [[Sudan]].  CIJ initiated and conducted advocacy and public education campaigns, targeting decision-makers in [[Washington DC|Washington]] and other capitals, media, and the public.

In the field, CIJ provided practical assistance on legal, technical, and outreach matters to the tribunals and other justice initiatives.  From 2000-2003, CIJ conducted a substantial rule of law project in East Timor.  Most recently, in July 2004, CIJ assembled an international team of professionals who conducted over 1,200 interviews in Chad with refugees who had fled the [[Darfur conflict|conflict in Darfur]], Sudan.

On March 31, 2006, the Coalition for Justice closed operations. In a letter from its board of directors, they noted that CIJ "was not intended to become a permanent institution."[http://www.cij.org/CIJ_Farewell_Letter.pdf]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}

The [[Ministry of Transport (Czech Republic)|Czech Transport Ministry]]’s tender was won by the consortium with a bid of CZK 10.7 billion. CzechToll's bid was CZK 2.7 billion less than the second most favoured bid from [[Kapsch]], which has been operating the toll system in the Czech Republic since 2006. After signing the relevant agreements, CzechToll will be the electronic toll collection system operator in the Czech Republic. SkyToll is the guarantor for the construction and operation of the system within the consortium, and CzechToll has the role of strategic partner, which includes funding the project.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

For PPF Group, the participation in the Czech electronic toll tender process was a strategic decision. This is borne out by success so far in a similar tender in [[Germany]], where PPF, with SkyToll as a subcontractor responsible for technical aspects of the project, is now among the finalists bidding to collect tolls on 53,000 kilometres of roads and motorways.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vz24.cz/clanky/vitez-mytneho-v-cr-czechtoll-skytoll-je-ve-finale-tendru-v-srn/|title=Vítěz mýtného v ČR CzechToll/SkyToll je ve finále tendru v SRN {{!}} vz24.cz|last=a.s|first=iVZ CZ,|website=www.vz24.cz|language=cs|access-date=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of the Central African Republic}}

The '''Democratic Forum for Modernity''' ({{lang-fr|Forum Démocratique pour la Modernité}}, FODEM) is a [[political party]] in the [[Central African Republic]].

==History==
The party was founded by [[Charles Massi]] on 27 November 1997 and legally recognized on 4 May 1998.&lt;ref name=Pro&gt;[http://www.fodem.org/fodem%20rca/biographie.htm Charles Massi] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927102712/http://www.fodem.org/fodem%20rca/biographie.htm |date=2007-09-27 }} FODEM&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Central African Republic parliamentary election, 1998|1998 parliamentary elections]] it won two seats in the [[National Assembly (Central African Republic)|National Assembly]]. Massi was the party's candidate for the [[Central African Republic presidential election, 1999|1999 presidential elections]], finishing eighth out of ten candidates with 1.3% of the vote.

In the first round of the [[Central African Republic general election, 2005|presidential elections]] held on 13 March 2005, Massi won 3.2% of the vote.&lt;ref name=DB&gt;[http://africanelections.tripod.com/cf.html Elections in the Central African Republic], African Elections Database.&lt;/ref&gt; He backed [[François Bozizé]] in the second round&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.izf.net/izf/Actualite/RDP/04/rca.htm Elections: MM. Ngoupandé et Massi apportent leur soutien à M. Bozizé] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928021526/http://www.izf.net/izf/Actualite/RDP/04/rca.htm |date=2007-09-28 }} AFP, 21 April 2005 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became a Minister of State in the government after the elections.&lt;ref name=List&gt;[http://www.izf.net/izf/Guide/R%C3%A9publique%20Centrafricaine/gouvernement.htm Lists of governments of the Central African Republic] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928021935/http://www.izf.net/izf/Guide/R%C3%A9publique%20Centrafricaine/gouvernement.htm |date=2007-09-28 }} IZF {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the simultaneous National Assembly elections, the party was reduced to a single seat.

After Massi was appointed as Political Coordinator of the [[Union of Democratic Forces for the Rally]] (UFDR) rebel group,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acap-cf.info/Cyriaque-Gonda-deplore-la-designation-de-Charles-Massi-comme-coordonnateur-politique-de-l-UFDR_a1170.html Cyriaque Gonda déplore la désignation de Charles Massi comme coordonnateur politique de l'UFDR] ACAP, 14 May 2008 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; FODEM rejected this move and expelled Massi from the party; it established a provisional political bureau on 22 May 2008 with [[Joseph Garba Ouangolé]] as President.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acap-cf.info/Bienvenu-Guinon-du-Fodem-appelle-au-patriotisme-des-Centrafricains_a1514.html Bienvenu Guinon du Fodem appelle au patriotisme des Centrafricains] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721183817/http://www.acap-cf.info/Bienvenu-Guinon-du-Fodem-appelle-au-patriotisme-des-Centrafricains_a1514.html |date=2011-07-21 }} ACAP, 2 September 2008 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 FODEM joined the Presidential Majority alliance in preparation for the [[Central African Republic general election, 2011|2011 general elections]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.journaldebangui.com/article.php?aid=565 Political agreement between the parties of the Presidential Majority] Journal de Bangui, 24 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The party nominated six candidates for the 105 seats in the [[National Assembly (Central African Republic)|National Assembly]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.content.eisa.org.za/old-page/car-number-national-assembly-candidates-party-2011-election CAR: Number of National Assembly candidates by party in the 2011 election] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402135656/http://www.content.eisa.org.za/old-page/car-number-national-assembly-candidates-party-2011-election |date=April 2, 2015 }} EISA&lt;/ref&gt; and although the alliance won 11 seats, FODEM failed to win a seat.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2847">The Deposit guarantee scheme of German banks is a private institution legally responsible for guaranteeing the deposits of account holders of German banks in accordance with domestic legislation and EU directives. It is 100% owned by the [[Bundesverband deutscher Banken|Federal association of German banks]]. Other voluntary schemes exist alongside the mandatory scheme.

==History==
The EdB was established on 24 August 1998 in compliance with the deposit and depositor protection law (EAEG). Since its establishment it has had to deal with several large scale compensations (IKB, Hypo Real Estate und Düsseldorfer Hypothekenbank). In 2008 the fund did not have enough assets to deal with the claims resulting from Lehman Brothers and the German state stepped in by providing a [[SoFFin]] guarantee enabling the institution to raise 6.7 Billion Euros on the bond market.&lt;ref&gt;{de}http://ec.europa.eu/eu_law/state_aids/comp-2009/n017-09.pdf{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
The institution is charged with guarnteeing the statutory 100,000 Euro per account holder and bank. The domestic law provides for the guarantee to rise to in steps to reach 437.500 Euro from 1 January 2025.&lt;ref&gt;{de}http://www.bankenverband.de/service/faq/einlagensicherung&lt;/ref&gt;

==Financing==
According to the Federal budget the EdB had 700 million EUR in assets as of 31 of December 2011, an increase of 130 million euros over the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;{de}http://www.bundesfinanzministerium.de/Content/DE/Standardartikel/Themen/Oeffentliche_Finanzen/Bundeshaushalt/Haushalts_und_Vermoegensrechnungen_des_Bundes/haushaltsrechnung-und-vermoegensrechnung-des-bundes-Vermoegensrechnung-2011.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&amp;v=2&lt;/ref&gt;

The fund is funanced by contributiond from the members of the [[Bundesverband deutscher Banken|Federal association of German banks]] according to a formular that is based 50% on some objective financial rations and 50% on the rating given to the bank by external ratings agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{de}http://www.edb-banken.de/downloads/2012_EdB-Bonitaetsfunktion.pdf{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other voluntary schemes==
In Germany the different banking confederations provide voluntary schemes in addition to the mandatory public scheme.

*Deposit Protection Fund
*Depositor Compensation Scheme of the Association of German Public Sector Banks GmbH
*Deposit-Protection Fund of the Association of German Public Sector Banks e.V.
*German Saving Banks Association
*National Association of German Cooperative Banks
*The German Private Commercial Banks Compensation Scheme for Investors

The '''Honil Gangni Yeokdae Gukdo Ji Do''' ("Map of Integrated Lands and Regions of Historical Countries and Capitals."&lt;ref name="rimu"&gt;Kenneth R. Robinson [http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/rimu/2007/00000059/00000002/art00002  Choson Korea in the Ryukoku Kangnido] in ''Imago Mundi'', Vol. 59 No. 2 (June 2007) pp. 177-192, via Ingenta Connect.&lt;/ref&gt;), often abbreviated as '''Kangnido''', is a world map created in [[Korea]], produced by Yi Hoe and Kwon Kun in 1402.&lt;ref name="Ledyard"&gt;Cartography of Korea, pgs. 235-345, Gari Ledyard ''al''., (Department of Geography, University of Wisconsin, Madison), The History of Cartography, Volume Two, Book Two, Cartography in Cartography in the Traditional East and Southeast Asian Societies, 1994, The University of Chicago Press, J.

The Kangnido is one of the oldest ''surviving'' world maps from [[East Asia]], along with the (''ca''. 1398) Chinese ''[[Da Ming Hun Yi Tu]]''.&lt;ref&gt;明代的古地图 (Ming Cartography), Cartography, GEOG1150, 2013, Qiming Zhou ''et''.

Nevertheless, the surviving copies of the Kangnido constitute one of the most important materials for reconstructing the original form of the 14th-century Chinese map. As a world map, it reflects the [[Chinese geography|geographic knowledge of China]] during the [[Mongol Empire]] when geographical information about Western countries became available via [[Geography in medieval Islam|Islamic geographers]].&lt;ref name="miya"&gt;(Miya 2006; Miya 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

It depicts the general form of the [[Old World]], from [[Africa]] and [[Europe]] in the west to [[Japan]] in the east.&lt;ref&gt;Angelo Cattaneo [http://www.bimcc.org/articles/20071116_BIMCC_Formatting_Europe_Conf_Abstract_1_cattaneo.pdf Europe on late Medieval and early Renaissance world maps], International BIMCC Conference (Nov 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Although, overall, it is less geographically accurate than its Chinese cousin, most obviously in the depiction of rivers and small islands, it does feature some improvements (particularly the depictions of Korea and Japan, and a less cramped version of Africa).

==Manuscripts==
Only two copies of the map are known today. Both have been preserved in Japan and show later modifications.

The map currently in [[Ryukoku University|Ryūkoku University]] (hereafter, Ryūkoku copy) has gathered scholarly attention since the early 20th century. It is 158&amp;nbsp;cm by 163&amp;nbsp;cm, painted on silk. It is presumed that the Ryūkoku copy was created in Korea but it is not clear when the copy was brought to Japan. One claims that it was purchased by [[Ōtani Kōzui]] and others assume that it was looted during the [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592-1598)|invasion of Korea]] (1592-1598) and given to the West Honganji temple by [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]].&lt;ref&gt;(Miya 2006:598-599,650)&lt;/ref&gt; It contains some place names of Korea that are newer than 1402, suggesting that the Ryūkoku copy was partially modified from the 1402 original around the 1470s and 1480s.&lt;ref&gt;(Aoyama 1938:111-112; Aoyama 1939:149-152; Robinson 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:GeneralMapOfDistancesAndHistoricCapitals.jpg|thumb|320px|The later Honkōji version of the map.]]
Another copy (Honkōji copy&lt;ref&gt;The title of the Honkōji copy is written in [[seal script]] and difficult to read. Some earlier studies read "混一疆理歷代國都'''地'''圖." See (Miya 2006:601).&lt;/ref&gt;) was discovered in the Honkōji temple of [[Shimabara, Nagasaki]] in 1988. It is 220&amp;nbsp;cm by 280&amp;nbsp;cm, much larger than the Ryūkoku copy, and painted on paper. It seems that the Honkōji copy was created in Japan during the [[Edo period]].&lt;ref&gt;(Miya 2006:599)&lt;/ref&gt; The place names of Korea suggests that it was revised around the 1560s.&lt;ref&gt;(Miya 2007:14)&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two copies of maps in Japan that are related to the map. One (Honmyōji copy) housed in the Honmyōji temple of [[Kumamoto, Kumamoto|Kumamoto]] is known as the "Map of the Great Ming" (大明國地圖). The other (Tenri copy) at [[Tenri University]] has no title and is tentatively called by a similar name (大明國圖).&lt;ref&gt;Unno Kazutaka 海野一隆: ''Tenri toshokan shozō Daimin koku zu ni tsuite'' 天理図書館所蔵大明国図について, Memoirs of the Osaka University of the Liberal Arts and Education. A, Humanistic Science, No. 6, pp. 60-67, 1957.&lt;/ref&gt; They are considered to be later adaptations of the original. The most important change is that place names of China are updated to those of the [[Ming Dynasty]] while the original showed administrative divisions of the Mongol [[Yuan Dynasty]].

Based on a legend of the temple, it has been assumed naively that the Honmyōji copy was given to [[Katō Kiyomasa]], the ruler of Kumamoto, by Toyotomi Hideyoshi in preparation for the Korean campaigns. However, the ''[[Annals of Joseon Dynasty|Seonjo Sillok]]'' of Korea reports that in 1593 the son of a Korean official who had surrendered to Katō copied and offered map(s) of China and Korea to him. This may refer to the extant Honmyōji map.&lt;ref&gt;(Miya 2006:600-601)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources and contents==
The Ryūkoku and Honkōji copies contain Gwon Geun (權近)'s preface at the bottom. The preface is also recorded in his anthology named ''Yangchon Seonsaeng Munjip'' (陽村先生文集). According to Gwon, the map was based on the following four maps:
* the world map named ''Shengjiao Guangbei Tu'' (聲教廣被圖) by Li Zemin (李澤民)
* the historical map of China named ''Hunyi Jiangli Tu'' (混一疆理圖) by [[Qingjun]] (清浚)
* an unnamed map of Korea
* an unnamed map of Japan
In the fourth year of the [[Jianwen Emperor|Jianwen]] era (1402), Korean officials named Kim Sa-hyeong (金士衡) and Yi Mu (李茂), and later Yi Hoe (李薈), analyzed the two Chinese maps and combined these two maps into a single map. They though that Li Zemin's map did not properly depict the region east to the Liao River ([[Liaodong]]) and Korea, they added the enlarged Korea, and also appended a map of Japan, premised about a similar map that was introduced to Korea from Japan in 1402.&lt;ref name="Ledyard"/&gt;

===Li Zemin's world map===
&lt;!-- Note: Erroneous image hidden [[File:645px-KangnidoCaption.jpg|thumb|300px|Main areas of the world as described by the Kangnido map.]] --&gt;
Li Zemin's world map is lost, and little is known about the creator Li Zemin. The Kangnido is a key map for reconstructing Li's world map. Other extant maps considered to be based on Li's map are:
* a pair of maps named ''Dongnan Haiyi Tu'' (東南海夷圖) and ''Xinan Haiyi Tu'' (西南海夷圖),&lt;ref&gt;(Takahashi 1963:92-93; Miya 2006:509-511)&lt;/ref&gt; which is recorded in the ''[[Guang Yu Tu]]'' (廣與圖)(1555) by [[Luo Hongxian]] (羅洪先), and
* the ''[[Da Ming Hun Yi Tu]]'' (circa 1389).&lt;ref&gt;(Miya 2006:511-512)&lt;/ref&gt;

There are possible literary references to Li's world map.  An important clue is provided by Wu Sidao (烏斯道)'s anthology titled ''Chuncaozhai Ji'' (春草齋集), where Wu states that  he had merged a map named ''Guanglun Tu'' (廣輪圖) and Li Rulin (李汝霖)'s ''Shengjiao Beihua Tu'' (聲教被化圖). Although his own map is not known today, Wu seems to have referred to Li's map concerned because the ''Shengjiao Beihua Tu'' would be an alias for ''Shengjiao '''Guangbei''' Tu'' (聲教廣被圖) and Rulin would have been Li Zemin's [[courtesy name]]. Wu states that Li's map was newer than the ''Guanglun Tu'' (circa 1360). Based on place names on the map, earlier studies presumed that the source map had been created around 1319 and revised sometime between 1329 and 1338. However, Wu suggests that Li's map was created sometime after 1360. Most importantly, Korea's attempt to merge Chinese maps had at least one precedent in the Mongol era.&lt;ref&gt;(Miya 2006:514-517)&lt;/ref&gt;

As a world map, the Kangnido depicts the general form of the Old World, from Africa and Europe in the west to Japan in the east although the western portion is much smaller than its actual size. It contains the cartographic knowledge of Afro-Eurasia that cannot be found in China in the pre-Mongol period. Place names presented on the map suggest that the western portion of the map reflects roughly the situation of the early 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;(Sugiyama 2007:80)&lt;/ref&gt; In the East, geographic information about the West was not updated in the post-Mongol period until Europeans such as [[Matteo Ricci]] brought Western knowledge.

Place names based on traditional Chinese knowledge and Islamic knowledge coexist separately. Their boundary line can be drawn from [[Beshbalik|Besh Baliq]] to [[Delhi]]. Names based on Chinese geography were placed to the north and east of Besh Baliq even if they are actually located to the west. For example, the [[Talas River]], a historic site for the [[Tang Dynasty]], was placed to the northeast of Besh Baliq although its actual direction is northwest. Similarly, India and Tibet are based on traditional Chinese knowledge, mainly gained by [[Buddhist pilgrimage]] up to the Tang Dynasty. To the west of the "old" India, contemporary place names of India such as Delhi, [[Badaun]] and Duwayjir∼Duwayqir (Persianized form of [[Devagiri]]) are shown. This suggests that information was acquired via the [[Ilkhanate]].&lt;ref&gt;(Sugiyama 2007:57-61,66-67)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:KangnidoPoliticalDetails.jpg|thumb|300px|Details of [[Africa]], [[Europe]] and the [[Middle East]].]]
Western Turkestan, Persia, Arabia, Egypt and Anatolia are quite clearly delineated. These areas are depicted in great detail while place names are sparsely distributed in northwestern Eurasia. They correspond to the territories of Ilkhanate and the rival [[Golden Horde]] respectively, reinforcing Ilkhanate as the main source of information.&lt;ref&gt;(Sugiyama 2007:61-66,67-68)&lt;/ref&gt;

There are about 35 African place names. The knowledge of the contour of Africa predates the European explorations of [[Vasco da Gama]]. In particular, the southern tip of Africa is quite clearly depicted, as well as a river which may correspond to the [[Orange River]] in [[Southern Africa]]. To the north of the African continent, beyond the unexplored "black" central mass, a pagoda is represented for the lighthouse of [[Alexandria]], and the Arab word "Misr" for [[Cairo]] (al-Qāhira) and [[Mogadishu]] (Maqdashaw) are shown among others.&lt;ref&gt;(Sugiyama 2007:62-63)&lt;/ref&gt; The Mediterranean forms a clear shape but is not blackened unlike other sea areas. The Maghreb and the Iberian peninsula are depicted in detail while [[Genoa]] and [[Venice]] are omitted. There are over 100 names for the European countries alone,&lt;ref name="jackson"&gt;Peter Jackson, "The Mongols and the West", Pearson Education Limited (2005) {{ISBN|0-582-36896-0}}, p.330&lt;/ref&gt; including "Alumangia" for the Latin word ''Alemania'' ([[Germany]]).

===Historical map of China===
The ''Hunyi Jiangli Tu'' by Zen monk Qingjun (1328–1392) was one of historical maps that were popular among Chinese literati. It showed historical capitals of Chinese dynasties in addition to contemporary place names. For example, it shows the capital of Yao, the legendary sage-emperor.

It followed Chinese tradition in that it was a map of China, not the world. But contrary to [[Song Dynasty|Song period]] maps which reflected limited Chinese knowledge on geography, it incorporated information on Mongolia and Southeast Asia. It also provided information of sea routes, for example, the sea route from [[Zayton]] to [[Hormuz Island|Hormuz]] via [[Java]] and [[Madurai Sultanate|Ma'bar]] (There remain traces on the Honmyōji and Tenri copies).&lt;ref&gt;(Miya 2006:498-503)&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Qingjun's map is lost, a modified edition of the map is contained in the ''Shuidong Riji'' (水東日記) by the Ming period book collector Ye Sheng (葉盛) (1420–1474) under the name of ''Guanglun Jiangli Tu'' (廣輪疆理圖). Ye Sheng also recorded Yan Jie (嚴節)'s colophon to the map (1452). According to Yan Jie, the ''Guanglun Jiangli Tu'' was created in 1360. The extant map was modified, probably by Yan Jie, to catch up with contemporary Ming place names. The original map covered place names of the Mongol Yuan Dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;(Miya 2006:489-498)&lt;/ref&gt; Also, Yan Jie's map suggests that the western end of Qingjun's map was around [[Hotan]].&lt;ref&gt;(Miya 2007:30)&lt;/ref&gt;

One may notice that the name of Qingjun's map ''Hunyi Jiangli Tu'' (混一疆理圖) bears a striking resemblance to that of the Kangnido, ''Hunyi Jiangli Lidai Guodu Zhi Tu'' (混一疆理歷代國都之圖) in Chinese. Actually, it is a combination of phrases common during the Mongol era. There were many preceding Chinese maps with similar titles, including the "Yu Gong Jiuzhou '''Lidai''' Diwang '''Guodu''' Dili Tu" (禹貢九州歷代帝王國都地理圖; Map of Capitals of Historical Emperors and Kings in the [[Jiuzhou|Nine Provinces]] of the ''[[Yu the Great|Yu]] Gong'').&lt;ref&gt;(Miya 2007:151-160)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Map of Korea===
Although Gwon Geun did not clarify which map was utilized for Korea, it is usually identified as Yi Hoe's ''Paldodo'' (八道圖). But the original condition of the Korean portion is unclear because even the oldest Ryūkoku copy reflects the administrative situation as late as around 1470.

Gwon Geun wrote that Li Zemin's map had many gaps and omissions concerning Korea. It is not clear how Korea was depicted on Li's map since Korea is out of the range of the extant derivative (southern half of the original).&lt;ref&gt;(Miya 2007:69-70)&lt;/ref&gt; The modified version of Qingjun's map provides a relatively proper shape of Korea though place names presented there are those of the preceding Goryeo Dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;(Miya 2007:49-50)&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that, according to Gwon Geun, Korea was intentionally oversized (for practical reasons).

===Map of Japan===
The two original Chinese maps portray Japan as a set of three islands that lie from east to west. They would be influenced by the legend of [[Xu Fu]]. According to the ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'', Xu Fu claimed that there were three divine mountains in the sea and went to one of the mountain-islands, which were later believed to be Japan.&lt;ref&gt;(Miya 2007:49-50,69-70)&lt;/ref&gt;

Japan is shown in better shape on the Ryūkoku copy than on traditional Chinese maps, but is rotated by 90 degrees. This drew attention from scholars and some even associated it with the controversy over the location of [[Yamataikoku]]. But the other three copies suggest that it is merely exceptional.&lt;ref&gt;(Miya 2006:591-592; Miya 2007:237-240)&lt;/ref&gt;

Since information on Japan differs considerably among the four copies, the original condition is unreconstructible. The Honkōji copy resembles maps in the ''[[Haedong Jegukgi]]'' (1471), suggesting that information was regularly updated.&lt;ref&gt;(Miya 2007:241-242)&lt;/ref&gt;

The original source map which Gwon Geun did not cite either is usually identified as the one obtained in Japan supposedly in 1401 by Bak Donji (朴敦之), based on an article of the ''[[Annals of Joseon Dynasty|Sejong Sillok]]'' (the 10th month of 1438). However, this article is obviously wrong because Bak stayed in Japan from 1397 to 1399 as an envoy to the [[Ōuchi family]] of western Japan but could never be there in 1401. Japanese scholar Miya Noriko considers that the date was intentionally altered for political reasons (see below).&lt;ref&gt;(Miya 2006:588-590)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Importance in Korea==
This map originated from a historical setting of the [[Mongol Empire]], which connected the western Islamic world with the Chinese sphere. The Mongol Empire demonstrated the conquest of the world by publishing treatise on geography and world maps. Their attempt enabled the integration of Islamic science and traditional Chinese knowledge. Note that the Chinese source maps were of "consumer use." In other words, they were not created by the empire for itself. It is presumed that the Mongol government gathered much more detailed information that was not disclosed to the public.&lt;ref&gt;(Miya 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese source maps were created by and circulated among literati of southern China, especially those in Qingyuan-lu ([[Ningbo]]). Qingjun, who was from neighboring Taizhou, created the historical map of ''Hunyi Jiangli Tu'' when he stayed in Qingyuan. Wu Sidao, who left an important bibliographic clue, was also from Qingyuan. In addition, Qingyuan-lu was one of the most important seaports from which the sea routes were extended to Fuzhou and Guangzhou, and Southeast Asia, Japan and Korea.

It is possible that these maps were available in Korea during the Mongol era. Korea, at the time under the [[Goryeo Dynasty]] (918-1392), was closely integrated into the Mongol Empire as a ''quda'' (son-in-law) state.&lt;ref&gt;Morihira Masahiko 森平雅彦: ''Kōrai ō ika no kisoteki kōsatsu: Daigen urusu no ichi bunken seiryoku to shite no Kōrai ōke'' 高麗王位下の基礎的考察--大元ウルスの一分権勢力としての高麗王家 (A Fundamental Study of Gao-li Wang Wei-xia: The Koryŏ Royal House as One Part of Dai-ön Yeke Mongɣol Ulus), Chōsen shi kenkyūkai ronbunshū 朝鮮史研究会論文集, No. 36, pp. 55-87, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; One supporting fact is recorded in the ''[[Goryeo-sa]]'': Na Heung-yu (羅興儒) created a historical map based on maps of China and Korea, and dedicated it to King Gongmin (r. 1352-1374).&lt;ref&gt;(Miya 2006:583-584)&lt;/ref&gt; Note that Gwon Geun served to the king as ''bichigechi'' (secretary).

Earlier studies presumed that the two Chinese source maps had been obtained during Kim Sa-hyeong's diplomatic trip to Ming China in 1399 although there is no literary evidence for his acquisition. It is more plausible that these maps came to Korea in different times since Gwon Geun's preface implies that Korean officials picked out the two maps for their excellency from among various sources, maybe including Wu Sidao's combined map.&lt;ref&gt;(Miya 2006:516-517,580-583)&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese scholar Miya Noriko presumes that the year 1402 was a landmark for the reigning King Taejong of the newly founded Joseon Dynasty. After a bloody succession struggle, Taejong ascended to the throne in 1400. In 1401, he was officially recognized as King of Joseon by the Chinese Emperor for the first time in the dynasty's history. In the 6th month of 1402, Yi Hoe's map of Korea was offered in a ceremony to celebrate his birthday. Then the project to combine it with Chinese and Japanese maps reportedly started in the summer (4th-6th months). This would be of symbolic significance in demonstrating royal power. This hypothesis also explains the factual error about the map of Japan. It was during the reigns of Taejo (1st king) and Jeongjong (2nd) that the map was obtained in Japan, but the date was altered to Taejong's reign.

Oddly enough, the [[Annals of Joseon Dynasty]] never mentions the map although it was obviously a national project. Another interesting fact is that this map uses the Ming Chinese era name ''[[Jianwen Emperor|Jianwen]]''. After the Jianwen Emperor lost to [[Yongle Emperor|Zhu Di]] in a civil war, the new emperor banned the use of the era name ''Jianwen'' in the 10th month of 1402. Thus the map should have used the era name ''Hongwu'', not ''Jianwen''. However, the era name ''Jianwen'' can be found even on the later Ryūkoku and Honkōji copies. This suggests that the Kangnido was never disclosed to the Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;(Miya 2006:586,596)&lt;/ref&gt;

This map demonstrates the cartographic stagnation in the post-Mongol era. The maps of common use were transformed into a symbol of national prestige and overshadowed by secrecy. As the extant copies show, Korean officials regularly updated the map by conducting land surveys and collecting maps from surrounding countries. Geographic information about the West was, however, not updated until the introduction of European knowledge in the 16-17th centuries.

It borders [[Denmark]] to the north, [[Poland]] and the [[Czech Republic]] to the east, [[Austria]] and [[Switzerland]] to the south, and [[France]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]] to the west. Germany includes 16 [[States of Germany|constituent states]], covers an area of {{convert|357,386|km2|sqmi}},&lt;ref name="Fläche"/&gt; and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With nearly 83 million inhabitants, it is the second most populous state of [[Europe]] after [[Russia]], the most populous state lying entirely in Europe, as well as the most populous [[member state of the European Union|member state]] of the [[European Union]]. Germany is a very [[decentralized]] country. Its [[capital city|capital]] and [[List of cities in Germany by population|largest]] metropolis is [[Berlin]], while [[Frankfurt]] serves as its financial capital and has the country's busiest [[Frankfurt Airport|airport]]. Many federal institutions have their (secondary) seat in the [[Federal city]] of [[Bonn]]. Germany's largest conurbation is the [[Ruhr]], with its main centres of [[Dortmund]] and [[Essen]]. The country's other major cities are [[Hamburg]], [[Munich]], [[Cologne]], [[Stuttgart]], [[Düsseldorf]], [[Leipzig]], [[Bremen]], [[Dresden]], [[Hannover]], and [[Nuremberg]].

Various [[Germanic tribes]] have inhabited the northern parts of modern Germany since [[classical antiquity]]. A region named [[Germania]] was [[Germania (book)|documented]] before 100&amp;nbsp;AD. During the [[Migration Period]], the Germanic tribes expanded southward. Beginning in the 10th century, German territories formed a central part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;The Latin name ''Sacrum Imperium'' (Holy Empire) is documented as far back as 1157. The Latin name ''Sacrum Romanum Imperium'' (Holy Roman Empire) was first documented in 1254. The full name "Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation" (''Heiliges Römisches Reich Deutscher Nation'', short HRR) dates back to the 15th century.&lt;br /&gt;{{cite book | last = Zippelius| first = Reinhold| title = Kleine deutsche Verfassungsgeschichte: vom frühen Mittelalter bis zur Gegenwart| trans-title = Brief German Constitutional History: from the Early Middle Ages to the Present| edition = 7th| origyear = 1994| year = 2006| publisher =Beck| language = German| isbn = 978-3-406-47638-9| page = 25}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 16th century, [[Northern Germany|northern German regions]] became the centre of the [[Protestant Reformation]]. After the collapse of the Holy Roman Empire, the [[German Confederation]] was formed in 1815. The [[German revolutions of 1848–49]] resulted in the [[Frankfurt Parliament]] establishing major democratic rights.

In 1871, Germany became a nation state when [[unification of Germany|most of the German states (most notably excluding Switzerland and Austria) unified]] into the [[Prussia]]n-dominated [[German Empire]]. After [[World War I]] and the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|revolution of 1918–19]], the Empire was replaced by the parliamentary [[Weimar Republic]].

From southern [[Scandinavia]] and north Germany, they expanded south, east and west from the 1st century&amp;nbsp;BC, coming into contact with the [[Celt]]ic tribes of [[Gaul]] as well as [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]], [[Balts|Baltic]], and [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] tribes in [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first =Jill N. |last = Claster |title =Medieval Experience: 300–1400 |publisher =New York University Press |year =1982 |page =35 |isbn=978-0-8147-1381-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under [[Augustus]], [[Roman Empire|Rome]] began to invade Germania (an area extending roughly from the Rhine to the [[Ural Mountains]]).

[[File:Franks expansion.gif|thumb|upright=1.05|Frankish Realm and its expansion. As it was partitioned in 843, [[West Francia]] (blue) and [[East Francia]] (red) became predecessors of [[France]] and Germany, respectively]]

In the 3rd century a number of large West Germanic tribes emerged: [[Alemanni]], [[Franks]], [[Chatti]], [[Saxons]], [[Frisii]], [[Sicambri]], and [[Thuringii]].

Simultaneously several large tribes formed in what is now Germany and displaced or absorbed smaller Germanic tribes. Large areas known since the [[Merovingian]] period as [[Austrasia]], [[Neustria]], and [[Duchy of Aquitaine|Aquitaine]] were conquered by the Franks who established the [[Frankish Kingdom]], and pushed farther east to subjugate [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]] and [[Duchy of Bavaria|Bavaria]]. Areas of what is today the eastern part of Germany were inhabited by [[West Slavs|Western Slavic]] tribes of [[Sorbs]], [[Veleti]] and the [[Obotrites|Obotritic confederation]].&lt;ref name="9-13" /&gt;

=== East Francia and Holy Roman Empire ===
{{Main|East Francia|Holy Roman Empire}}
In 800, the Frankish king [[Charlemagne]] was crowned emperor and founded the [[Carolingian Empire]], which was later [[Treaty of Verdun|divided in 843]] among his heirs.&lt;ref name="f11"&gt;Fulbrook 1991, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the break up of the Frankish Realm, for 900 years, the history of Germany was intertwined with the history of the [[Holy Roman Empire]],&lt;ref&gt;The lumping of Germanic people into the generic term 'Germans' has its roots in the [[Investiture Controversy]] according to historian Herwig Wolfram, who claimed it was a defensive move made by the papacy to delineate them as outsiders, partly due to the papacy's insecurity and so as to justify counterattacks upon them. See: {{cite book|author=Wolfram, Herwig|title=The Roman Empire and its Germanic Peoples|publisher=California University Press|year=1997|pages=11–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; which subsequently emerged from the eastern portion of Charlemagne's original empire. The territory initially known as [[East Francia]] stretched from the Rhine in the west to the [[Elbe]] River in the east and from the [[North Sea]] to the [[Alps]].&lt;ref name="f11" /&gt; The [[Ottonian]] rulers (919–1024) consolidated several major [[Stem duchy|duchies]] and the German king [[Otto I]] was crowned [[Holy Roman Emperor]] of these regions in 962. In 996 [[Pope Gregory V|Gregory V]] became the first German Pope, appointed by his cousin [[Otto III]], whom he shortly after crowned Holy Roman Emperor. The Holy Roman Empire absorbed northern Italy and [[Burgundy (historical region)|Burgundy]] under the reign of the [[Salian]] emperors (1024–1125), although the emperors lost power through the [[Investiture Controversy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=McBrien, Richard|title=Lives of the Popes: The Pontiffs from St. Peter to Benedict XVI|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2000|page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lucas Cranach d.Ä. - Martin Luther, 1528 (Veste Coburg).jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Martin Luther]] (1483–1546) initiated the [[Protestant Reformation]].]]
In the 12th century, under the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] emperors (1138–1254), German princes increased their influence further south and east into territories inhabited by [[Slavs]]; they encouraged [[History of German settlement in Central and Eastern Europe|German settlement]] in these areas, called the eastern settlement movement ''([[Ostsiedlung]])''. Members of the [[Hanseatic League]], which included mostly north German cities and towns, prospered in the expansion of trade.&lt;ref&gt;Fulbrook 1991, pp. 13–24.&lt;/ref&gt; In the south, the Greater Ravensburg Trade Corporation (''Große Ravensburger Handelsgesellschaft'') served a similar function. The edict of the [[Golden Bull of 1356|Golden Bull]] issued in 1356 by Emperor [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] provided the basic constitutional structure of the Empire and codified the election of the emperor by seven [[prince-elector]]s who ruled some of the most powerful principalities and archbishoprics.&lt;ref&gt;Fulbrook 1991, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Population declined in the first half of the 14th century, starting with the [[Great Famine of 1315–1317|Great Famine]] in 1315, followed by the [[Black Death]] of 1348–50.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.vlib.us/medieval/lectures/black_death.html |title=The Great Famine (1315–1317) and the Black Death (1346–1351) |first=Lynn Harry |last=Nelson |publisher=University of Kansas |accessdate=19 March 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429072010/http://www.vlib.us/medieval/lectures/black_death.html |archivedate=29 April 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the decline, however, German artists, engineers, and scientists developed a wide array of techniques similar to those used by the Italian artists and designers of the time who flourished in such merchant [[Italian city-states|city-states]] as [[Republic of Venice|Venice]], [[Republic of Florence|Florence]] and [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]]. Artistic and cultural centres throughout the German states produced such artists as the Augsburg painters [[Hans Holbein the Elder|Hans Holbein]] and his [[Hans Holbein the Younger|son]], and [[Albrecht Dürer]]. [[Johannes Gutenberg]] introduced moveable-type [[printing]] to Europe, a development that laid the basis for the [[democratization of knowledge|spread of learning to the masses]].&lt;ref&gt;Eisenstein, Elizabeth.

[[File:HRR 1648.png|thumb|left|The [[Holy Roman Empire]] in 1648, after the [[Peace of Westphalia]], which ended the [[Thirty Years' War]]]]

In 1517, the [[Wittenberg]] monk [[Martin Luther]] publicised [[The Ninety-Five Theses]], challenging the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and initiating the [[Protestant Reformation]]. In 1555, the [[Peace of Augsburg]] established [[Lutheranism]] as an acceptable alternative to Catholicism, but also decreed that the faith of the prince was to be the faith of his subjects, a principle called [[Cuius regio, eius religio]]. The agreement at Augsburg failed to address other religious creed: for example, the [[Calvinism|Reformed faith]] was still considered a [[heresy]] and the principle did not address the possible conversion of an ecclesiastic ruler, such as happened in [[Electorate of Cologne]] in 1583. From the [[Cologne War]] until the end of the [[Thirty Years' War]]s (1618–1648), religious conflict devastated German lands.&lt;ref name=Philpott&gt;{{cite journal|last=Philpott|first=Daniel|title=The Religious Roots of Modern International Relations|journal=World Politics|date=January 2000|volume=52|issue=2|pages=206–245|doi=10.1017/S0043887100002604}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter reduced the overall population of the German states by about 30 per cent, and in some places, up to 80 per cent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Savage Wars of Peace: England, Japan and the Malthusian Trap |first=Alan |last=Macfarlane |publisher=Blackwell |year=1997 |page=51 |isbn=978-0-631-18117-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Peace of Westphalia]] ended religious warfare among the German states.&lt;ref name=Philpott /&gt; German rulers were able to choose either Roman Catholicism, Lutheranism or the Reformed faith as their official religion after 1648.&lt;ref&gt;For a general discussion of the impact of the Reformation on the Holy Roman Empire, see [[Hajo Holborn]], ''A History of Modern Germany, The Reformation'', Princeton N.J., Princeton University Press, 1959, chapters 6–9 (pp. 123–248).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 18th century, the Holy Roman Empire consisted of approximately 1,800 [[List of states in the Holy Roman Empire|territories]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gagliardo, G|title=Reich and Nation, The Holy Roman Empire as Idea and Reality, 1763–1806|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=1980|pages=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The elaborate legal system initiated by a series of [[Imperial Reform]]s (approximately 1450–1555) created the [[Imperial State|Imperial Estates]] and provided for considerable local autonomy among ecclesiastical, secular, and hereditary states, reflected in [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]]. The [[House of Habsburg]] held the imperial crown from 1438 until the death of [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI]] in 1740. Having no male heirs, he had convinced the [[Prince-elector|Electors]] to retain Habsburg hegemony in the office of the emperor by agreeing to the [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1713|Pragmatic Sanction]]. This was finally settled through the [[War of Austrian Succession]]; in the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]], Charles VI's daughter [[Maria Theresa]] ruled the Empire as [[Queen consort|Empress Consort]] when her husband, [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis I]], became Holy Roman Emperor. From 1740, the [[German dualism|dualism]] between the Austrian [[Habsburg Monarchy]] and the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] dominated the German history.

In 1772, then again in 1793 and 1795, the two dominant German states of Prussia and Austria, along with the [[Russian Empire]], agreed to the [[Partitions of Poland]]; dividing among themselves the lands of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. As a result of the partitions, millions of Polish speaking inhabitants fell under the rule of the two German monarchies. However, the annexed territories though incorporated into the Kingdom of Prussia and the Habsburg Realm, were not legally considered as a part of the Holy Roman Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Robert |last1=Bideleux |first2=Ian |last2=Jeffries |title=A History of Eastern Europe: Crisis and Change |publisher=Routledge |year=1998 |page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Judy |last1=Batt |first2=Kataryna |last2=Wolczuk |title=Region, State and Identity in Central and Eastern Europe |publisher=Routledge |year=2002 |page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the period of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], along with the arrival of the [[Napoleonic era]] and the subsequent [[Final Recess of the Reichsdeputation|final meeting of the Imperial Diet]], most of the secular [[Free Imperial Cities]] were annexed by dynastic territories; the ecclesiastical territories were secularised and annexed. In 1806 the ''Imperium'' was dissolved; many German states, particularly the [[Confederation of the Rhine|Rhineland states]], fell under the influence of France. Until 1815, France, Russia, Prussia and the Habsburgs (Austria) competed for hegemony in the German states during the [[Napoleonic Wars]].&lt;ref&gt;Fulbrook 1991, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== German Confederation and Empire ===
{{Main|German Confederation|German Empire|German Colonial Empire}}
[[File:Deutscher Bund.svg|thumb|A map showing the [[German Confederation]] (1815–1836) with its 39 member states.]]
Following the fall of [[Napoleon]], the [[Congress of Vienna]] (convened in 1814) founded the German Confederation (''Deutscher Bund''), a loose league of [[States of the German Confederation|39 sovereign states]]. The appointment of the [[Emperor of Austria]] as the permanent president of the Confederation reflected the Congress's failure to accept Prussia's rising influence among the German states, and acerbated the long-standing competition between the Hohenzollern and Habsburg interests. Disagreement within [[European Restoration|restoration]] politics partly led to the rise of [[Liberalism in Germany|liberal]] movements, followed by new measures of repression by Austrian statesman [[Klemens von Metternich|Metternich]]. The ''[[Zollverein]]'', a tariff union, furthered economic unity in the German states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Henderson |first=W.

The [[Hambach Festival]] in May 1832 was a main event in support of [[German question|German unity]], freedom and democracy. In the light of a [[Revolutions of 1848|series of revolutionary movements in Europe]], which established a republic [[French Revolution of 1848|in France]], intellectuals and commoners started the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states]]. King [[Frederick William IV of Prussia]] was offered the title of Emperor, but with a loss of power; he rejected the crown and the proposed constitution, leading to a temporary setback for the movement.&lt;ref name="state" /&gt;

King [[William I, German Emperor|William I]] appointed [[Otto von Bismarck]] as the new [[Minister President of Prussia]] in 1862. Bismarck successfully concluded [[Second Schleswig War|war on Denmark]] in 1864, which promoted German over Danish interests in the Jutland peninsula. The subsequent (and decisive) Prussian victory in the [[Austro-Prussian War]] of 1866 enabled him to create the [[North German Confederation]] (''Norddeutscher Bund'') which excluded [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] from the federation's affairs. After the French defeat in the [[Franco-Prussian War]], the German princes proclaimed the founding of the [[German Empire]] in 1871 at [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]], uniting all the scattered parts of Germany except Austria and the German-speaking parts of Switzerland. Prussia was the dominant constituent state of the new empire; the [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern]] King of Prussia ruled as its concurrent Emperor, and Berlin became its capital.&lt;ref name="state" /&gt;

In the {{lang|de|[[Gründerzeit]]}} period following the [[unification of Germany]], Bismarck's foreign policy as [[Chancellor of Germany]] under Emperor William I secured Germany's position as a great nation by forging alliances, isolating [[French Third Republic|France]] by diplomatic means, and avoiding war. Under [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]], Germany, like other European powers, took an [[New Imperialism|imperialistic]] course, leading to friction with neighbouring countries. Most alliances in which Germany had previously been involved were not renewed. This resulted in creation of a [[Dual Alliance (1879)|dual alliance]] with the [[multinational state|multinational realm]] of [[Austria-Hungary]], promoting at least [[benevolent neutrality]] if not outright military support. Subsequently, the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance of 1882]] included Italy, completing a Central European geographic alliance that illustrated German, Austrian and Italian fears of incursions against them by France and/or Russia. Similarly, Britain, France and Russia also concluded alliances that would protect them against Habsburg interference with Russian interests in the Balkans or German interference against France.&lt;ref&gt;Fulbrook 1991, pp.&amp;nbsp;135, 149.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Berlin Conference]] in 1884, Germany claimed several [[List of former German colonies|colonies]] including [[German East Africa]], [[German South West Africa]], [[Togoland]], and [[Kamerun]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=100 maps |year=2005 |publisher=Sterling Publishing |isbn=978-1-4027-2885-3 |editor=Black, John |page=202}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Germany further expanded its [[German colonial empire|colonial empire]] to include [[German New Guinea]], [[German Micronesia]] and [[German Samoa]] in the Pacific, and [[Kiautschou Bay concession|Kiautschou Bay]] in China. In what became known as the "First Genocide of the Twentieth-Century", between 1904 and 1907, the German colonial government in South West Africa (present-day [[Namibia]]) ordered the [[Herero and Namaqua genocide|annihilation of the local Herero and Namaqua peoples]], as a punitive measure for an uprising against German colonial rule. In total, around 100,000 people—80% of the [[Herero people|Herero]] and 50% of the [[Nama people|Namaqua]]—perished from imprisonment in [[concentration camps]], where the majority died of disease, abuse, and exhaustion, or from dehydration and starvation in the countryside after being deprived of food and water.&lt;ref&gt;Olusoga, David and Erichsen, Casper W (2010).

Germany was declared a [[republic]] at the beginning of the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|German Revolution]] in November 1918.

It was supported by parts of the ''[[Reichswehr]]'' (military) and other conservative, nationalistic and monarchist factions. After a tumultuous period of bloody street fighting in the major industrial centres, the [[occupation of the Ruhr]] by Belgian and French troops and the rise of inflation culminating in the [[Hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic|hyperinflation of 1922–23]], a [[Dawes Plan|debt restructuring plan]] and the creation of a [[German Rentenmark|new currency]] in 1924 ushered in the [[Golden Twenties]], an era of increasing artistic innovation and liberal cultural life.

Using deficit spending, a government-sponsored programme for economic renewal focused on public works projects.

After Germany surrendered, the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] partitioned Berlin and Germany's remaining territory into four military occupation zones. The western sectors, controlled by France, the United Kingdom, and the United States, were merged on 23 May 1949 to form the [[West Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]] (''Bundesrepublik Deutschland''); on 7 October 1949, the Soviet Zone became the [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]] (''Deutsche Demokratische Republik''). They were informally known as [[West Germany]] and [[East Germany]].

East Germany was an [[Eastern Bloc]] state under political and military control by the USSR via occupation forces and the [[Warsaw Pact]]. Although East Germany claimed to be a democracy, political power was exercised solely by leading members (''[[Politburo|Politbüro]]'') of the communist-controlled [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]], supported by the [[Stasi]], an immense secret service controlling many aspects of the society.&lt;ref name="spiegel_20080311"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/east-german-spies-new-study-finds-more-stasi-spooks-a-540771.html|title = New Study Finds More Stasi Spooks|author = maw/dpa|date = 11 March 2008|newspaper = Spiegel Online|accessdate = 30 October 2011|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121119094328/http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/east-german-spies-new-study-finds-more-stasi-spooks-a-540771.html|archivedate = 19 November 2012|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Soviet-style [[command economy]] was set up and the GDR later became a [[Comecon]] state.&lt;ref name="loc-cs"&gt;"Germany (East)", Library of Congress Country Study, [http://memory.loc.gov/frd/cs/germany_east/gx_appnb.html Appendix B: The Council for Mutual Economic Assistance] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501075842/http://memory.loc.gov/frd/cs/germany_east/gx_appnb.html |date=1 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While [[Communist propaganda|East German propaganda]] was based on the benefits of the GDR's social programmes and the alleged constant threat of a West German invasion, many of its citizens looked to the West for freedom and prosperity.&lt;ref name="NYT_19890822"&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/22/world/westward-tide-of-east-germans-is-a-popular-no-confidence-vote.html |title = Westward Tide of East Germans Is a Popular No-Confidence Vote |first = Ferdinand |last = Protzman |date = 22 August 1989 |work = The New York Times |accessdate = 30 October 2011 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121004232849/http://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/22/world/westward-tide-of-east-germans-is-a-popular-no-confidence-vote.html |archivedate = 4 October 2012 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Berlin Wall]], rapidly built on 13 August 1961 prevented East German citizens from escaping to West Germany, eventually becoming a symbol of the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref name="state" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/places/berlin_wall|title=The Berlin Wall|access-date=8 February 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170226011158/http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/places/berlin_wall|archivedate=26 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ronald Reagan]]'s "[[Mikhail Gorbachov|Mr. Gorbachov]], [[Tear down this wall!]]" speech at the Wall on 12 June 1987 influenced public opinion, echoing [[John F.

Tensions between East and West Germany were reduced in the early 1970s by Chancellor [[Willy Brandt]]'s {{lang|de|[[Ostpolitik]]}}. In summer 1989, Hungary decided to dismantle the [[Iron Curtain]] and open the borders, causing the emigration of thousands of [[East Germans]] to West Germany via Hungary. This had devastating effects on the GDR, where regular [[Monday demonstrations in East Germany|mass demonstrations]] received increasing support. The East German authorities eased the border restrictions, allowing East German citizens to travel to the West; originally intended to help retain East Germany as a state, the opening of the border actually led to an acceleration of the ''Wende'' reform process. This culminated in the ''[[Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany|Two Plus Four Treaty]]'' a year later on 12 September 1990, under which the four occupying powers renounced their rights under the [[German Instrument of Surrender|Instrument of Surrender]], and Germany regained full sovereignty. This permitted [[German reunification]] on 3 October 1990, with the accession of the [[New states of Germany|five re-established states]] of the former GDR.&lt;ref name="state" /&gt;

Germany is in [[Western Europe|Western]] and [[Central Europe]], with [[Denmark]] bordering to the north, [[Poland]] and the [[Czech Republic]] to the east, [[Austria]] to the southeast, [[Switzerland]] to the south-southwest, France, [[Luxembourg]] and Belgium lie to the west, and the [[Netherlands]] to the northwest. It lies mostly between latitudes [[47th parallel north|47°]] and [[55th parallel north|55° N]] and longitudes [[5th meridian east|5°]] and [[16th meridian east|16° E]]. Germany is also bordered by the North Sea and, at the north-northeast, by the Baltic Sea. With Switzerland and Austria, Germany also shares a border on the fresh-water [[Lake Constance]], the third largest lake in Central Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.mcmaster.ca/maps/fc1999.htm Image #432, Flying Camera Satellite Images 1999] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015142609/http://library.mcmaster.ca/maps/fc1999.htm |date=15 October 2015 }}, Lloyd Reeds Map Collection, McMaster University Library.&lt;/ref&gt; German territory covers {{convert|357021|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}, consisting of {{convert|349223|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} of land and {{convert|7798|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} of water.

Elevation ranges from the mountains of the [[Alps]] (highest point: the [[Zugspitze]] at {{convert|2962|m|ft|0|disp=or}}) in the south to the shores of the [[North Sea]] (''Nordsee'') in the northwest and the [[Baltic Sea]] (''Ostsee'') in the northeast. The forested uplands of central Germany and the lowlands of northern Germany (lowest point: [[Wilstermarsch]] at {{convert|3.54|m|ft|1|disp=or}} below sea level) are traversed by such major rivers as the Rhine, [[Danube]] and [[Elbe]]. Germany's alpine glaciers are experiencing deglaciation. Significant natural resources include iron ore, coal, [[potash]], timber, [[lignite]], [[uranium]], copper, natural gas, salt, nickel, [[arable land]] and water.&lt;ref name="CIA" /&gt;

=== Climate ===
[[File:Mittelrhein Burg Katz.jpg|thumb|right|Rhine valley in summer at [[Lorelei]].]]
Most of Germany has a [[temperate]] seasonal climate dominated by humid westerly winds. The country is situated in between the [[Oceanic climate|oceanic]] Western European and the [[Continental climate|continental]] Eastern European climate. The climate is moderated by the [[North Atlantic Current|North Atlantic Drift]], the northern extension of the [[Gulf Stream]]. This warmer water affects the areas bordering the North Sea; consequently in the northwest and the north the climate is oceanic. Germany gets an average of {{convert|789|mm|0|abbr=on}} of [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] per year; there is no consistent dry season. Winters are cool and summers tend to be warm: temperatures can exceed {{convert|30|°C|°F|lk=on}}.&lt;ref name="climate"&gt;{{cite web|title=Climate in Germany|url=http://www.germanculture.com.ua/library/facts/bl_climate.htm|publisher=GermanCulture|accessdate=26 March 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205082859/http://www.germanculture.com.ua/library/facts/bl_climate.htm|archivedate=5 February 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The east has a more continental climate: winters can be very cold and summers very warm, and longer dry periods can occur. Central and southern Germany are transition regions which vary from moderately oceanic to continental. In addition to the maritime and continental climates that predominate over most of the country, the Alpine regions in the extreme south and, to a lesser degree, some areas of the Central German Uplands have a mountain climate, with lower temperatures and more precipitation.&lt;ref name="climate" /&gt;

Though the German climate is rarely extreme, there are occasional spikes of cold or heat. Winter temperatures can sometimes drop to two-digit negative temperatures for a few days in a row. Conversely, summer can see periods of very high temperatures for a week or two. The recorded extremes are a maximum of {{convert|40.3|°C|°F|lk=on}} (July 2015, in [[Kitzingen]]), and a minimum of {{convert|-37.8|°C|°F|lk=on}} (February 1929, in [[Pfaffenhofen an der Ilm]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Wetterrekorde Deutschland |url=https://www.wetterdienst.de/Klima/Wetterrekorde/Deutschland/Temperatur/Max/ |publisher=wetterdienst.de |accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plants and animals include those generally common to Central Europe. [[Beeches]], [[oak]]s, and other [[deciduous]] trees constitute one-third of the forests; [[conifers]] are increasing as a result of [[reforestation]]. [[Spruce]] and [[fir]] trees predominate in the upper mountains, while [[pine]] and [[larch]] are found in sandy soil. There are many species of [[fern]]s, [[flowers]], [[fungi]], and [[mosses]]. Wild animals include [[Central European red deer|roe deer]], [[Central European boar|wild boar]], [[mouflon]] (a subspecies of wild sheep), [[Red fox|fox]], [[European badger|badger]], [[European hare|hare]], and small numbers of the [[Eurasian beaver]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Bekker |first=Henk |title=Adventure Guide Germany |year=2005 |publisher=Hunter |isbn =978-1-58843-503-3 |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Prussian blue|blue]] [[cornflower]] was once a German [[floral emblem|national symbol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Marcel Cleene|author2=Marie Claire Lejeune| title = Compendium of Symbolic and Ritual Plants in Europe: Herbs| url = https://books.google.com/?id=g5GBAAAAMAAJ| year = 2002| publisher = Man &amp; Culture| quote=The Cornflower was once the floral emblem of Germany (hence the German common name Kaiserblume).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Germany is a [[federal republic|federal]], [[parliamentary democratic|parliamentary]], [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] republic. The German political system operates under a framework laid out in the 1949 constitutional document known as the ''[[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Grundgesetz]]'' (Basic Law). Amendments generally require a two-thirds majority of both chambers of parliament; the fundamental principles of the constitution, as expressed in the articles guaranteeing human dignity, the separation of powers, the federal structure, and the [[rule of law]] are valid in perpetuity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.btg-bestellservice.de/pdf/80201000.pdf|title=Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|date=October 2010|website=Deutscher Bundestag|publisher=Btg-bestellservice|accessdate=14 April 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170619180331/https://www.btg-bestellservice.de/pdf/80201000.pdf|archivedate=19 June 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[President of Germany|president]], [[Frank-Walter Steinmeier]] (19 March 2017–present), is the [[head of state]] and invested primarily with representative responsibilities and powers. He is elected by the ''[[Bundesversammlung (Germany)|Bundesversammlung]]'' (federal convention), an institution consisting of the members of the ''Bundestag'' and an equal number of state delegates. The second-highest official in the [[German order of precedence]] is the ''Bundestagspräsident'' ([[President of the Bundestag|President of the ''Bundestag'']]), who is elected by the ''Bundestag'' and responsible for overseeing the daily sessions of the body. The third-highest official and the [[head of government]] is the Chancellor, who is appointed by the ''Bundespräsident'' after being elected by the ''Bundestag''.&lt;ref name="state" /&gt;

[[File:Political System of Germany.svg|thumb|left|The political system of Germany]]

The chancellor, [[Angela Merkel]] (22 November 2005–present), is the head of government and exercises [[executive (government)|executive power]] through their [[Cabinet of Germany|Cabinet]], similar to the role of a [[Prime Minister]] in other parliamentary democracies. Federal [[legislative power]] is vested in the parliament consisting of the ''[[Bundestag]]'' (Federal Diet) and ''[[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]]'' (Federal Council), which together form the legislative body. The ''Bundestag'' is elected through [[direct election]]s, by [[proportional representation]] ([[mixed member proportional representation|mixed-member]]).&lt;ref name="CIA" /&gt; The members of the ''Bundesrat'' represent the governments of the sixteen federated states and are members of the state cabinets.&lt;ref name="state" /&gt;

Since 1949, the party system has been dominated by the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] and the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]]. So far every chancellor has been a member of one of these parties. However, the smaller liberal [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (in parliament from 1949 to 2013) and the [[Alliance '90/The Greens]] (in parliament since 1983) have also played important roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/germany/159.htm|title=Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union|publisher=U.S. Library of Congress|accessdate=26 March 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430010247/http://countrystudies.us/germany/159.htm|archivedate=30 April 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2005, the left-wing populist party [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]], formed through the merger of two former parties, has been a staple in the German ''Bundestag'' though they have never been part of the federal government. In the [[German federal election, 2017]], the right-wing populist [[Alternative for Germany]] gained enough votes to attain representation in the parliament for the first time.

The [[debt-to-GDP ratio]] of Germany had its peak in 2010 when it stood at 80.3% and decreased since then.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2015/01/weodata/weorept.aspx?sy=2005&amp;ey=2020&amp;scsm=1&amp;ssd=1&amp;sort=country&amp;ds=.&amp;br=1&amp;pr1.x=67&amp;pr1.y=6&amp;c=122%2C136%2C124%2C941%2C423%2C137%2C939%2C181%2C172%2C138%2C132%2C182%2C134%2C936%2C174%2C961%2C178%2C184&amp;s=GGXWDG%2CGGXWDG_NGDP&amp;grp=0&amp;a= |title=World Economic Outlook Database, April 2015, General government gross debt (National currency, Percent of GDP) |publisher=International Monetary Fund |date=April 2015 |accessdate=26 January 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205090730/http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2015/01/weodata/weorept.aspx?sy=2005&amp;ey=2020&amp;scsm=1&amp;ssd=1&amp;sort=country&amp;ds=.&amp;br=1&amp;pr1.x=67&amp;pr1.y=6&amp;c=122%2C136%2C124%2C941%2C423%2C137%2C939%2C181%2C172%2C138%2C132%2C182%2C134%2C936%2C174%2C961%2C178%2C184&amp;s=GGXWDG%2CGGXWDG_NGDP&amp;grp=0&amp;a= |archivedate=5 February 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Eurostat]], the [[Government debt|government gross debt]] of Germany amounts to €2,152.0 billion or 71.9% of its [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/7141153/2-22012016-AP-EN.pdf/8288af1f-6f6f-4d2e-91ba-d5c45f07f2e2 |title=Third quarter of 2015 compared with second quarter of 2015 – Government debt fell to 91.6 % of GDP in euro area |publisher=Eurostat |date=22 January 2016 |accessdate=26 January 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160124213139/http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/7141153/2-22012016-AP-EN.pdf/8288af1f-6f6f-4d2e-91ba-d5c45f07f2e2 |archivedate=24 January 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The federal government achieved a budget surplus of €12.1 billion ($13.1 billion) in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/german-government-achieves-historic-budget-surplus-1452691320 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313173915/http://www.wsj.com/articles/german-government-achieves-historic-budget-surplus-1452691320 |archivedate=13 March 2016 |title=German Government Achieves 'Historic' Budget Surplus |publisher=The World Street Journal |date=13 January 2016 |accessdate=26 January 2016|newspaper=Wall Street Journal |last1=Thomas |first1=Andrea }}&lt;/ref&gt; Germany's [[credit rating]] by [[credit rating agencies]] [[Standard &amp; Poor's]], [[Moody's]] and [[Fitch Ratings]] stands at the highest possible rating ''AAA'' with a stable outlook in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSFit94584220160108 |title=Reuters: Fitch Affirms Germany at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable |newspaper=Reuters |date=8 January 2016 |accessdate=26 January 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160202054602/http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSFit94584220160108 |archivedate=2 February 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the differences in size and population the [[States of Germany#Subdivisions|subdivisions of the states]] vary. For regional administrative purposes four states, namely Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Hesse and North Rhine-Westphalia, consist of a total of 19 [[Regierungsbezirke|Government Districts]] (''Regierungsbezirke''). {{As of|2017}} Germany is divided into 401 [[Districts of Germany|districts]] (''Kreise'') at a municipal level; these consist of 294 [[List of rural districts of Germany|rural districts]] and 107 [[Urban districts of Germany|urban districts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.destatis.de/DE/ZahlenFakten/LaenderRegionen/Regionales/Gemeindeverzeichnis/Administrativ/Archiv/Verwaltungsgliederung/Verwalt2QAktuell.xlsx?__blob=publicationFile|title=Verwaltungsgliederung in Deutschland am 30 June 2017 – Gebietsstand: 30 June 2017 (2.

In peacetime, the Bundeswehr is commanded by the Minister of Defence.

The role of the ''Bundeswehr'' is described in the [[Constitution of Germany]] as defensive only.

Until 2011, [[Conscription in Germany|military service]] was compulsory for men at age 18, and conscripts served six-month tours of duty; [[conscientious objectors]] could instead opt for an equal length of ''[[Zivildienst]]'' (civilian service), or a six-year commitment to (voluntary) emergency services like a [[Volunteer fire department|fire department]] or the [[German Red Cross|Red Cross]].

=== Religion ===
{{Main|Religion in Germany}}
Upon its establishment in 1871, Germany was about two-thirds [[Protestant]]{{efn|German Protestantism has been overwhelmingly a mixture of Lutheran, Reformed (i.e. Calvinist), and United (Lutheran &amp; Reformed/Calvinist) churches, with Baptists, Pentecostals, Methodists, and various other Protestants being only a recent development.}} and one-third [[Roman Catholic]], with a notable [[Jews|Jewish]] minority. Other faiths existed in the state, but never achieved a demographic significance and cultural impact of these three confessions. Germany lost nearly all of its Jewish minority during the [[Holocaust]]. Religious makeup changed gradually in the decades following 1945, with West Germany becoming more religiously diversified through [[Immigration to Germany|immigration]] and East Germany becoming overwhelmingly irreligious through [[State atheism|state policies]]. It continues to diversify after the German reunification in 1990, with an accompanying substantial decline in religiosity throughout all of Germany and a contrasting increase of [[evangelical Protestants]] and [[Muslims]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vnocWI0_fywC&amp;pg=PA173|title=Germany: A Country Study|author=Solsten, Eric|isbn=978-0-7881-8179-5|year=1999|publisher=Diane Publishing|pages=173–175|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202033637/https://books.google.com/books?id=vnocWI0_fywC&amp;pg=PA173|archivedate=2 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geographically, Protestantism is concentrated in the northern, central and eastern parts of the country.{{efn|Lutheranism is found mostly throughout northern Germany, [[Württemberg]] and parts of [[Franconia]]; Calvinism in the extreme northwest and [[Lippe]], while the United churches throughout the remainder of Germany.}} These are mostly members of the EKD, which encompasses [[Lutheran]], [[Reformed]] and [[United and uniting churches|administrative or confessional unions of both traditions]] dating back to the [[Prussian Union of churches|Prussian Union]] of 1817.{{efn|Although the first such union between Lutheran and Calvinist Protestants happened in August 1817 in the [[Duchy of Nassau]] (a confessional union, ''see [[Unionskirche, Idstein]]''); that is before the Prussian Union of September 1817.

German painters have influenced [[Art of Europe|western art]].

Several German art groups formed in the 20th century, such as the [[November Group (German)|November Group]] or [[Die Brücke]] (The Bridge) and [[Der Blaue Reiter]] (The Blue Rider), by the Russian-born [[Wassily Kandinsky]], influenced the development of [[Expressionism]] in Munich and Berlin. The [[New Objectivity]] arose as a counter-style to it during the [[Weimar Republic]]. Post-World War II art trends in Germany can broadly be divided into [[Neo-expressionism]], [[performance art]] and [[Conceptual art|Conceptualism]]. Especially notable neo-expressionists include [[Georg Baselitz]], [[Anselm Kiefer]], [[Jörg Immendorff]], [[A. R. Penck]], [[Markus Lüpertz]], [[Peter Robert Keil]] and [[Rainer Fetting]]. Other notable artists who work with traditional media or figurative imagery include [[Martin Kippenberger]], [[Gerhard Richter]], [[Sigmar Polke]], and [[Neo Rauch]]. Leading German conceptual artists include or included [[Bernd and Hilla Becher]], [[Hanne Darboven]], [[Hans-Peter Feldmann]], [[Hans Haacke]], [[Joseph Beuys]], [[HA Schult]], [[Aris Kalaizis]], [[Neo Rauch]] ([[New Leipzig School]]) and [[Andreas Gursky]] (photography).

Architectural contributions from Germany include the [[Carolingian architecture|Carolingian]] and [[Ottonian architecture|Ottonian styles]], which were precursors of [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]]. [[Brick Gothic]] is a distinctive medieval style that evolved in Germany. Also in [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] and [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] art, regional and typically German elements evolved (e.g. [[Weser Renaissance]] and ''[[Dresden]] Baroque''). Among many renowned Baroque masters were [[Matthäus Daniel Pöppelmann|Pöppelmann]], [[Johann Balthasar Neumann|Balthasar Neumann]], [[Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff|Knobelsdorff]] and the [[Asam brothers]]. The [[Wessobrunner School]] exerted a decisive influence on, and at times even dominated, the art of stucco in southern Germany in the 18th century. The [[Upper Swabian Baroque Route]] offers a baroque-themed tourist route that highlights the contributions of such artists and craftsmen as the sculptor and plasterer [[Johann Michael Feuchtmayer]], one of the foremost members of the [[Feuchtmayer]] family and the brothers [[Johann Baptist Zimmermann]] and [[Dominikus Zimmermann]].&lt;ref&gt;Jan Koppmann, "Das Zeitalter des Barock", in M. Thierer (ed.), ''Lust auf Barock: Himmel trifft Erde in Oberschwaben'',  Lindenberg: Kunstverlag Fink, 2002, p. 11f.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vernacular architecture]] in Germany is often identified by its [[Fachwerkhaus|timber framing]] (''Fachwerk'') traditions and varies across regions, and among carpentry styles.&lt;ref name="Wilhelm Süvern 1971"&gt;Wilhelm Süvern: 1971.

When industrialisation spread across Europe, [[Classicism]] and a distinctive style of [[Historicism (art)|historism]] developed in Germany, sometimes referred to as ''[[Gründerzeit]] style'', due to the economical boom years at the end of the 19th century. Regional historicist styles include the ''[[Hanover school of architecture|Hanover School]]'', ''[[Nuremberg]] Style'' and Dresden's ''[[Gottfried Semper|Semper]]-[[Georg Hermann Nicolai|Nicolai]] School''. Among the most famous of German buildings, the [[Schloss Neuschwanstein]] represents [[Romanesque Revival]]. Notable sub-styles that evolved since the 18th century are the [[List of spa towns in Germany|German spa]] and [[List of seaside resorts in Germany|seaside resort]] architecture. German artists, writers and gallerists like [[Siegfried Bing]], [[Georg Hirth]] and [[Bruno Möhring]] also contributed to the development of [[Art Nouveau]] at the turn of the 20th century, known as ''Jugendstil'' in German.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huntfor.com/arthistory/c19th/artnouveau.htm |title=Art Nouveau&amp;nbsp;— Art Nouveau Art |publisher=Huntfor.com |accessdate=25 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130222070337/http://www.huntfor.com/arthistory/c19th/artnouveau.htm |archivedate=22 February 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Expressionist architecture]] developed in the 1910s in Germany and influenced [[Art Deco]] and other modern styles, with e.g. [[Johann Friedrich Höger|Fritz Höger]], [[Erich Mendelsohn]], [[Dominikus Böhm]], and [[Fritz Schumacher (architect)|Fritz Schumacher]] being influential architects. Germany was particularly important in the early [[modern architecture|modernist movement]]: it is the home of [[Deutscher Werkbund|Werkbund]] initiated by [[Hermann Muthesius]] ([[New Objectivity (architecture)|New Objectivity]]), and of the [[Bauhaus]] movement founded by [[Walter Gropius]]. Consequently, Germany is often considered the cradle of modern architecture and design. [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]] became one of the world's most renowned architects in the second half of the 20th century. He conceived of the glass façade [[skyscraper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=2006|title=A Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=880|isbn=978-0-19-860678-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Renowned contemporary [[List of German architects|architects]] and offices include [[Hans Kollhoff]], [[Sergei Enwerowitsch Tschoban|Sergei Tchoban]], [[Christoph Kohl (architect)|KK Architekten]], [[Helmut Jahn]], [[Behnisch Architekten|Behnisch]], [[Gerkan, Marg and Partners|GMP]], [[Ole Scheeren]], [[Jürgen Mayer (architect)|J.

[[Cinema of Germany|German cinema]] has made major technical and artistic contributions to film. The first works of the [[Max Skladanowsky|Skladanowsky Brothers]] were shown to an audience in 1895. The renowned [[Babelsberg Studio]] in [[Potsdam]] was established in 1912, thus being the first large-scale film studio in the world (today it is Europe's second largest studio after [[Cinecittà]] in [[Rome]], [[Italy]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinecitta.com/IT/it-it/cms/132/studios.aspx|title=Studios|last=SemiColonWeb|website=www.cinecitta.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110818094006/http://www.studiobabelsberg.com/service/filmstudios-ateliers/neue-film-1/ Studio Babelsberg] – ''Mit der Erschließung des direkt in der Nachbarschaft befindlichen Filmgeländes mit den Studios Neue Film 1 und Neue Film 2 konnte Studio Babelsberg seine Studiokapazitäten verdoppeln und verfügt so über Europas größten zusammenhängenden Studiokomplex.'', retrieved 3 December 2013 (German)&lt;/ref&gt; Other early and still active studios include [[UFA GmbH|UFA]] and [[Bavaria Film]].

[[File:Filmstudio Babelsberg Eingang.jpg|thumb|[[Babelsberg Studio]] near Berlin, the world's first large-scale film studio]]

After 1945, many of the films of the immediate post-war period can be characterised as ''[[Rubble film|Trümmerfilm]]'' (rubble film). Such films included [[Wolfgang Staudte]]'s ''[[Die Mörder sind unter uns]] (The Murderers are among us, 1946)'' and ''[[Somewhere in Berlin|Irgendwo in Berlin]]'' (Somewhere in Berlin, 1946) by [[Werner Krien]]. The state-owned East German film studio [[DEFA (film studio)|DEFA]] produced notable films including ''[[Marriage in the Shadows|Ehe im Schatten]]'' (Marriage in the Shadows) by [[Kurt Maetzig]] (1947), ''[[Der Untertan (film)|Der Untertan]]'' (1951); ''[[Die Geschichte vom kleinen Muck]]'' (The Story of Little Muck, 1953), [[Konrad Wolf]]'s ''[[Divided Heaven (film)|Der geteilte Himmel]] (Divided Heaven)'' (1964) and [[Frank Beyer]]'s ''[[Jacob the Liar (1975 film)|Jacob the Liar]]'' (1975). The defining film genre in West Germany of the 1950s was arguably the ''[[Heimatfilm]]'' ("homeland film"); these films depicted the beauty of the land and the moral integrity of the people living in it.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Brockmann, ''A Critical History of German Film'', Camden House, 2010, p. 286. {{ISBN|1571134689}}&lt;/ref&gt; Characteristic for the films of the 1960s were genre films including [[Films based on works by Edgar Wallace#German adaptations|Edgar Wallace]] and [[Karl May film adaptations|Karl May]] adaptations. One of the most successful German movie series of the 1970s included the [[sex report film|sex reports]] called ''[[Schulmädchen-Report]]'' (Schoolgirl Report). During the 1970s and 1980s, [[New German Cinema]] directors such as [[Volker Schlöndorff]], [[Werner Herzog]], [[Wim Wenders]], and [[Rainer Werner Fassbinder]] brought West German auteur cinema to critical acclaim.

Among the box office hits, there were films such as ''[[Chariots of the Gods (film)|Chariots of the Gods]]'' (1970), ''[[Das Boot]]'' (The Boat, 1981), ''[[The NeverEnding Story (film)|The Never Ending Story]]'' (1984), ''[[Otto – Der Film|Otto – The Movie]]'' (1985), ''[[Run Lola Run]]'' (1998), ''[[Der Schuh des Manitu|Manitou's Shoe]]'' (2001), the ''[[Resident Evil (film)|Resident Evil]]'' series (2002–2016), ''[[Good Bye, Lenin!]]'' (2003), ''[[Head-On (film)|Head On]]'' (2004), ''[[The White Ribbon]]'' (2009), ''[[Animals United]]'' (2010), and ''[[Cloud Atlas (film)|Cloud Atlas]]'' (2012). The [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] ("Oscar") went to the German production ''[[The Tin Drum (film)|Die Blechtrommel (The Tin Drum)]]'' in 1979, to ''[[Nowhere in Africa|Nirgendwo in Afrika (Nowhere in Africa)]]'' in 2002, and to ''[[The Lives of Others|Das Leben der Anderen (The Lives of Others)]]'' in 2007.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3561">The '''Hanseatic Days of New Time''' or the '''Hansa Days of New Time''' ({{lang-de|Hansetage der Neuzeit}}) is an annual international festival of member cities of the [[Hanseatic League#Modern_.22City_League_The_HANSE.22|Hanseatic League of New Time]] (also known as the New Hansa).

The Hanseatic Days are held annually in one of the member cities of the New Hansa since 1980, when it was decided to re-establish the [[Hanseatic League]] and the first Hanseatic Days were held in [[Zwolle]], [[the Netherlands]]. During the festival, Hanseatic cities from different European countries try to position themselves as cities that have rich historic traditions but that continue their successful development in our days as well. Apart from the festival, Hanseatic Days include an international forum where representatives of member cities of the New Hansa discuss their political, economic and cultural cooperation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37718">'''Italophilia''' is the admiration, appreciation or emulation of Italy, its people, its ideals, its civilization or its culture. Its opposite is [[Italophobia]].

The extent to which Italian civilization has shaped [[Western civilization]] and, by extension, the civilization of the whole world, is widely recognized and acknowledged.  Appreciation of the legacy of Italic ideals, civilization and culture has existed for many centuries, into the present day.

== Roman era ==
[[File:Statue-Augustus.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of [[Augustus]], first Roman emperor and creator of "Italia" as an entity]]

Rome was the center of an empire that stretched across a large segment of the then-known world, and later became the center of the Roman Catholic faith. [[Roman civilization]] was transplanted to many parts of Europe, the Mediterranean basin, North Africa and the Near East in the form of law, architecture, engineering, roads, aqueducts, public baths, sanitation, trade, literature, art, libraries, hospitals and agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, C., Baldwin, M. and Cole, C.; ''History of Western Civilization'', The Macmillan Company, New York, 1968&lt;/ref&gt;  It was possible for the people in the provinces to attain Roman citizenship, rise to the Senate, and even to become Roman emperor. The Roman provinces, having received much of the benefit of Roman civilization, became Romanized to a large degree.  [[Winston Churchill]] states:&lt;ref&gt;Churchill, Winston, ''History of the English Speaking Peoples'', Barnes and Noble, 1994, pg. 8&lt;/ref&gt;
: ''For nearly 300 years Britain, reconciled to the Roman system, enjoyed in many respects the happiest, most comfortable, and most enlightened times its inhabitants have ever had.

The Christian Faith was viewed in Rome as contrary to prevailing religious and political beliefs and, consequently, was suppressed.  Many Christians in Rome and elsewhere were persecuted.  After the conversion of the Emperor Constantine to Christianity in 312 AD, Christianity flourished and became an integral part of Roman life. Roman Catholicism, which combined Christianity and Roman administration, emerged in a form easily recognizable today, and took root in Rome and much of the Roman Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Durant, Will, ''Caesar and Christ, The Story of Civilization'', Simon &amp; Schuster, New York, 1953, pg. 618&lt;/ref&gt; The Church adopted many religious customs and forms common in pre-Christian Rome, such as the stole and other vestments, the use of incense and holy water in purifications, burning candles before the altar, the veneration of saints, the architecture of the basilica, the law of Rome as a basis for canon law, the title Pontifex Maximus for the Pope, and Latin as the language of Catholic ritual.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;''Caesar and Christ, The Story of Civilization'', pg. 619&lt;/ref&gt;

The cultural patrimony of Roman literature, architecture and sculpture inspired many of the achievements of the [[Middle Ages]] and [[Renaissance]] in Italy and the rest of Europe.  Works by poets, authors and historians, such as [[Ovid]], [[Horace]], [[Catullus]], [[Cicero]], [[Virgil]], [[Livy]] and [[Tacitus]] had a far reaching impact on the Western world.

The legacy of Rome is apparent in the Western world, and elsewhere, in numerous ways, such as:

* The Roman alphabet
* Roman numerals
* Names of the planets
* Names of the months
* Names of the days of the week (in Romance-language countries)
* [[Julian Calendar]] (used for almost 1500 years), replaced in 1582 by the [[Gregorian Calendar]]
* Systems of government and law based on Roman models
* First modern concept of a [[hospital]]
* Latin-derived languages in Italy, France, Spain, Portugal and by extension, the languages of many Latin American and African nations
* Languages heavily influenced by Latin, such as Modern English (approximately half Latin based)
* The Roman arch
* Techniques used in building roads, bridges, aqueducts, viaducts, etc.
* Use of concrete as a building material
* The stadium
* Wine-making cultures in Italy, France, Spain, Portugal, Austria and Southern Germany

== Medieval period ==

After the fall of the Roman Empire, its vast governmental network provided a structure for the Roman Catholic Church’s ecclesiastic rule.  The bishops, rather than the Roman prefects became the source of order and the seat of power.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In many important ways, the [[Roman Catholic Church]] became the successor of the Roman Empire.  The Church and its Pope were major stabilizing influences in Europe in the centuries that followed.  In the words of historian [[Will Durant]] (in his ''Caesar and Christ, The Story of Civilization):
: ''Rome died in giving birth to the Church; the Church matured by inheriting and accepting the responsibilities of Rome.

The civilization of Italy continued to be a cultural force that helped preserve Greco-Roman civilization and ideals during this period.  Latin, the indigenous language of the Italic people, became the universal language of the Catholic Church and, generally, of culture and learning in Europe.

Western [[Monasticism]], as first practiced by the followers of [[Benedict of Nursia|Saint Benedict]], born in Nursia in 480 AD, spread from Italy to all parts of Europe.  The Benedictine monks were a very important factor in preserving Greco-Roman culture and learning for later centuries.

[[Gregorian Chant]], an outgrowth of Roman plain chant, strongly influenced both liturgical and secular music during the Middle Ages. An Italian monk, [[Guido of Arezzo]] (born in 991), developed the form of musical notation that became the basis of Western music and, subsequently, of music worldwide.

[[Saint Francis of Assisi]] (born Giovanni di Bernardone in Assisi in 1181) was a friar who founded the men's Order of Friars Minor and the women’s Order of St. Clare, both of which attracted many followers from all over Europe. He became one of the most venerated religious figures in Catholic Church history.

[[Saint Thomas Aquinas]], a Dominican priest born in Aquino in 1225, was a philosopher and theologian. He was one of the greatest minds of the Middle Ages, and he had a widespread influence on Western thought.  He was considered then, as he is now, to be the greatest theologian and philosopher of the Catholic Church.  He is best known for his major work, the  ''Summa Theologica.

Educated people in Europe were familiar with the works of [[Dante]] and [[Boccaccio]], which dominated the literature of the Middle Ages, and with their contemporary [[Petrarch]], who had established the most important lyric poetry tradition in Europe.  These works had a significant influence on [[Shakespeare]], [[Chaucer]] and many other writers of the Middle Ages and Renaissance.

[[File:Dante Alighieri01.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Statue of Dante at the [[Uffizi Gallery]], Florence]]

Students and scholars came from all over Europe to study at institutions of higher learning in Italy.  The [[Schola Medica Salernitana|Medical School at Salerno]], founded in the ninth century, was the world's first medical school, and unrivalled in the Middle Ages. The [[University of Bologna]], the first modern university, was founded in Bologna in 1088. The University of Padua, the second oldest university in Italy, was founded in 1222 as a school of law.  The [[University of Naples Federico II|University of Naples]], founded in 1224, was the world's first state-supported university.

During the [[Middle Ages]], the vitality of Italian merchants was evident throughout Europe, and the resultant trade prompted their invention of financial and business practices which provided the foundation for modern banking, commerce and capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;Lopez, Robert, ''The Commercial Revolution of the Middle Ages, 950-1350'', Cambridge University Press, 1976&lt;/ref&gt; The original banks were "[[merchant bank]]s" that Italian grain merchants first invented in the Middle Ages. Merchants and bankers grew in stature based on the strength of the Lombard plains cereal crops, and [[capitalism]] evolved based on these banks.

Indeed, [[banking]] (from the Italian word for "bench") can be traced to medieval and early [[Renaissance]] [[Italy]], to the rich cities in the north such as [[Florence]], [[Venice]] and [[Genoa]]. The [[Bardi family|Bardi]] and [[Peruzzi]] families dominated banking in 14th century Florence, establishing branches in many other parts of [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;Hoggson, N. F, ''Banking Through the Ages'', Dodd, Mead &amp; Company, New York, 1926.&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the most famous Italian bank was the [[Medici]] bank, established by Giovanni Medici in 1397.&lt;ref&gt;Goldthwaite, R. A., ''Banks, Places and Entrepreneurs in Renaissance Florence'', Aldershot, Hampshire, Great Britain, Variorum, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; The development of banking spread from northern Italy through Europe during the early Renaissance and helped create modern capitalism.  [[Luca Pacioli]] is referred to as the "Father of Accounting"

The [[Bank of Saint George]] (''Casa delle compere e dei banchi di San Giorgio'') was a bank of the [[Republic of Genoa]], which was the main financer of the voyages of Columbus to the New World by [[Spain]], founded in the 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;George Macesich, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=h-5jG8hR-qQC&amp;pg=PA42&amp;dq=bank+saint+george+genoa+1407&amp;as_brr=3 Issues in money and banking]'', p42. Greenwood Publishing, 2000. {{ISBN|978-0-275-96777-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the oldest chartered [[bank]] in [[Europe]] and the world.

==The Renaissance==

The [[Italian Renaissance]] was to a large extent an expression of humanism, that led to one of the most productive and significant periods in human history in the arts, literature, medicine and science. Greeks fleeing the Turkish invasion of the Byzantine Empire flocked to Italy, and helped spur the Renaissance and interest in ancient Greek texts. The Italian Renaissance also transformed art and humanism across Europe, and set the stage for the Enlightenment.

In the words of historian Will Durant:&lt;ref&gt;Durant, Will, ''The Renaissance, The Story of Civilization'', Simon &amp; Schuster, New York, 1953, pg. 718&lt;/ref&gt;

: ''From 1500 to 1600 all Western Europe acknowledged her as the mother and nurse of the new civilization of science and art and the humanities ... So the sixteenth century, when the Renaissance declined in Italy, was an age of exuberant germination in France, England, Germany, Flanders, and Spain.

[[Giotto di Bondone|Giotto]], born in 1267, is recognized as the first great artistic genius of the Italian Renaissance. His ability to portray human emotions distinguished him from the artists of the Middle Ages, and he established a style of painting that would be widely emulated in Italy and, later, elsewhere in Europe.  Italian Renaissance painters and sculptors, such as Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo Buonarroti, and scores of others of the first rank, were greatly admired and acclaimed, and had a widespread influence on artistic concepts and esthetic standards throughout Europe.

Italian artists, beginning with Giotto, mastered the use of [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] and [[chiaroscuro]] (light and shadow), which had a widespread influence on Western art.  [[Brunelleschi]], an architect, was the first to explain perspective in terms of a well-defined set of geometric rules.  Some science historians credit the mastery of chiaroscuro, together with the discovery of the rules of perspective, as of fundamental importance in the development of modern science.&lt;ref&gt;Edgerton, Samuel, ''The Heritage of Giotto's Geometry: Art and Science on the Eve of the Scientific Revolution'', Cornell University Press, 1991, pg. 10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tarnas, Richard, ''Passions of the Western Mind'', Penguin Random House, 2011, pg. 230&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kemp, Martin ''The Science of Art: Optical Themes in Western Art from Brunelleschi to Seurat'', Yale University Press, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aldus Manutius]] (Aldo Manuzio) (1449 – 1515) was one of the foremost intellectuals and humanists of the Renaissance, but is most renowned as an early entrepreneur and innovator in the new printing media.  In over 20 years in which his Aldine Press (established 1494) was in operation, he published many classic works from antiquity.  He was the first to publish pocket-size volumes, achieving this by using standardized typefaces.  He was the innovator of the first [[italic type]] along with other typefaces and typographical characters.

[[File:Michelangelo's Pieta 5450 cropncleaned edit.jpg|thumb|[[Michelangelo|Michelangelo's]]
[[Pietà]] in [[St. Peter's Basilica]]]]

[[Leonardo da Vinci]], born in 1452 in Vinci,  was a painter, sculptor, architect, musician, mathematician, engineer, inventor, anatomist, geologist, cartographer, botanist, and writer. His genius, perhaps more than that of any of his contemporaries, epitomized the creative energy of the Renaissance. He is widely considered to be one of the greatest painters of all time, and his [[Mona Lisa]] is regarded by many to be the most famous painting in the world.  His anatomical drawings have never been surpassed in detail and accuracy, and are still in use today.&lt;ref&gt;Wells, Francis, ''The Heart of Leonardo'', Springer, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michelangelo]] was born in Florence in 1475 and, like Leonardo, was a true Renaissance man.  He was a sculptor, painter, architect, poet, and engineer who exerted an unparalleled influence on the development of Western art.  He was considered the greatest living artist in his lifetime and, since then, one of the greatest artists of all time. His two best-known sculptures, the Pietà and David, are famous throughout the world. Michelangelo also created two of the most famous and influential frescoes in the history of Western art: the scenes from Genesis covering the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, and The Last Judgment on the altar wall of the Chapel.

[[Renaissance architecture]] of the 15th and 16th centuries was a revival of elements of ancient Greek and Roman architecture.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/itar/hd_itar.htm&lt;/ref&gt; It first developed in Florence, with [[Brunelleschi]], [[Leon Battista Alberti|Alberti]] and [[Palladio]] being among its innovators, and soon spread to other Italian cities, and later to France, Germany, England, Russia and other parts of Europe.  The Renaissance style placed emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts as exemplified in the architecture of classical antiquity and in particular in the architecture of ancient Rome, of which many examples remained.  It was succeeded by [[Baroque architecture]].

Italian singers, composers, dancers and actors had a great impact on music and the performing arts. [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Palestrina]], [[Monteverdi]] and [[Girolamo Frescobaldi|Frescobaldi]] were responsible for musical innovations that were seminal in the development of Western music.  Italian [[Commedia dell'arte]] was an art form that had a great influence in the performing arts, not only in Italy but in many other parts of Europe as well.

[[Ballet]] began in 15th-century Renaissance Italy.  The foot positions and steps that make up classic ballet were created by Renaissance dance masters in the 1400s.  Wealthy Italian nobles staged elaborate court dances to celebrate events such as weddings or the birth of an heir. The choreographers of these Renaissance spectacles became known as ballet masters. One of the earliest ballet masters, [[Domenico da Piacenza]], wrote dance manuals describing the steps, with diagrams of the figures and patterns created by the movements, which allowed the dances to be recreated in other courts throughout Europe.  He used the word "ballo", the Italian word for dance, to describe his choreography.  When [[Catherine de Medici]] married [[Henry II of France|King Henry II of France]], she brought the Italian dance tradition with her to France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classroom.synonym.com/ballet-renaissance-period-15707.html|title=Ballet in the Renaissance Period - Synonym|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The flourishing of arts in [[Tudor England]] during the [[English Renaissance]] attracted many Italian artists and musicians to the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historytoday.com/john-gage/england-italian-renaissance|title=England in the Italian Renaissance - History Today|website=www.historytoday.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Shakespeare]] is said to have exhibited Italophilia in his many works with an Italian setting, such as [[Romeo and Juliet]] and [[The Merchant of Venice]].&lt;ref&gt;Clubb, Louise George, ''Italian Drama in Shakespeare's Time'' (New Haven and London, Yale University Press, 1989), p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Edmund Spenser|Spenser]]'s epic poem, [[The Faerie Queene]], was greatly influenced by Italian epic poems, particularly [[Ludovico Ariosto]]'s ''Orlando Furioso'' (1532), and [[Torquato Tasso]]'s ''Gerusalemme Liberata'' (1581). [[Francis I of France|Francis I]], king of France, initiated the French Renaissance by attracting many Italian artists, including Leonardo da Vinci, to his court. French theatre of the 17th century was rooted in the theatre of 16th-century Italy. [[Poland]] was strongly influenced by Italian artisans, painters, sculptors and architects, such as the sculptor, Giammaria Mosca,&lt;ref&gt;Schultz, Anne Markham, ''Giammaria Mosca, Called Padovano: A Renaissance Sculptor in Italy and Poland'', Pennsylvania State University Press, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; whose many commissions included the tomb of the king of Poland.  The Spanish writer, [[Miguel de Cervantes|Cervantes]], was greatly influenced by Italian literature, which is readily discernible in his own works.&lt;ref&gt;DeArmas, Frederick, ed.,''The Cambridge Companion to Cervantes'', Chapter 3: ''Cervantes and the Italian Renaissance'', Cambridge University Press, 2002, pp. 32-57&lt;/ref&gt;  Spanish theatre of the 17th century was strongly influenced by Italian models.

The University of Bologna, the first modern university, was a leading center of mathematical studies in the 16th century, and it was there that [[Niccolò Fontana Tartaglia]] developed the method of solving cubic equations, an achievement previously considered impossible.  Extending Tartaglia’s work, [[Lodovico Ferrari]] devised a similar method to solve quartic equations, and both solutions were published by [[Gerolamo Cardano]].  The solutions to the cubic and quartic equations used, for the first time, what are now known as [[complex numbers]], although it was another Bologna mathematician, [[Rafael Bombelli]], who first  explained what complex numbers are, and how they could be used.  Complex numbers have since found practical applications in many fields, including physics, chemistry, biology, economics, electrical engineering, and statistics.  Later, Cardano published the first systematic treatment of [[probability]].

Italy was a center of commerce and Italian explorers and merchants, such as the Venetian [[Marco Polo]], and the [[Maritime republics|Italian maritime republics]] moved all around the known world. The Genoese explorer [[Cristoforo Colombo]] discovered America in 1492, changing world history forever.  Another Italian navigator, [[Amerigo Vespucci]], was the source of the name given to the New World.  They were followed by other New World navigators from the Italian peninsula, notably the Venetians [[Giovanni Caboto]] (John Cabot) and  [[Sebastiano Caboto]] (Sebastian Cabot), and the Florentine [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]].

== Age of Enlightenment ==

Beginning in the 16th century, Italian states came under the political control of more powerful European monarchies; however, Italy continued to be a source of creative energy in art, science, music and medicine.  Enlightenment thinkers, like Renaissance thinkers, were interested in pre-Christian Greek and Roman thought.

[[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]], born in 1564 in [[Pisa]], was the most famous scientist of his age, and played a major role in the [[Scientific Revolution]].  He is often referred to as the “Father of Modern Science.”  His achievements include a greatly improved telescope, which he employed in making astronomical observations supporting the heliocentric theory of [[Copernicus]]; and also the experiments he carried out leading to his law of falling bodies, which was of key importance in [[Isaac Newton|Newton’s]] synthesis of his own famous three laws of motion.

[[Bonaventura Cavalieri]], a Jesuit priest and mathematician, born in 1598, is known for his work on indivisibles, a precursor of [[infinitesimal calculus]], and for [[Cavalieri's principle]] in geometry, which partially anticipated [[integral calculus]].

[[File:Galileo.arp.300pix.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Galileo Galilei]], the founder of modern science.]]

[[Alessandro Volta]], born in Como in 1745, invented the first true electrical battery, known as the voltaic pile. It provided a continuous source of electric current, which greatly benefitted [[André-Marie Ampère|Ampere]], [[Georg Ohm|Ohm]] and other electrical experimenters in their development of basic electrical theory.  A unit of electricity (volt) is named in his honor.

Italians such as [[Gabriello Fallopio|Fallopio]], [[Bartolomeo Eustachi|Eustachi]], [[Malpighi]], [[Giovanni Battista Morgagni|Morgagni]] and [[Antonio Maria Valsalva|Valsalva]] were important pioneers of modern anatomy at the [[University of Bologna]] and [[University of Padua]], which drew students from all over Europe.  Padua's famous anatomical theatre was renowned in Europe at the time, and the great English medical scientist [[William Harvey]] received his education there.&lt;ref&gt;Boorstin, Daniel, ''The Discoverers, Vintage Books, New York, 1985, pp. 376-83''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cesare Beccaria]], a philosopher, jurist and marquis wrote [[On Crimes and Punishments]] (1754), dealing with the abolition of [[torture]] and [[capital punishment]], which had a great impact throughout Europe and in the United States.  It strongly influenced intellectuals and politicians in the age of enlightenment, and led to a revolution and reform of judiciary systems to the prevailing modern concept.  In 1786, [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]] was the first to abolish capital punishment.

[[Giordano Bruno]] had a great influence on 17th-century scientific and philosophical thought and, ever since, his ideals have been absorbed by many philosophers.  Bruno's freedom of thought inspired European liberal movements of the 19th century.  The significance of Bruno’s work lies in his cosmological theories, which anticipated some fundamental aspects of the modern concept of the universe; his ethical ideas, in contrast with religious ascetical ethics, which appealed to modern humanistic activism; and his ideals of religious and philosophical tolerance. 

[[Giambattista Vico]] was a [[political philosopher]], [[rhetorician]], [[historian]], and [[jurist]], who is recognized as one of the great [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinkers. He criticized the expansion and development of modern rationalism and was an apologist of classical antiquity.  His major work, ''Scienza Nuova'', published in 1725, has been highly influential in the philosophy of history, into the 20th-century.

[[Opera]] originated in Italy at the end of the 16th century (with the opera [[Dafne]], which was composed by [[Jacopo Peri]], and produced in Florence in 1598), and soon spread to the rest of Europe. Italian opera was adapted by French, German and Russian composers, who developed their own national schools of opera.

Italian instrumental music was studied and emulated all over Europe.  The [[sonata]], [[concerto]], [[sinfonia]], [[oratorio]] and other musical forms all originated in Italy.  Italian terminology defining the tempo and mood of a musical passage was universally adopted in Western music.  The music of Italian composers, such as [[Arcangelo Corelli|Corelli]], [[Alessandro Scarlatti|Scarlatti]], and [[Antonio Vivaldi|Vivaldi]], was studied or transcribed by many other composers of the day, most notably [[Bach]].  In addition, many composers, such as [[Handel]], [[Christoph Willibald Ritter von Gluck|Gluck]] and [[Mozart]] studied or worked in Italy, and subsequently became famous for their instrumental music and operas.

The [[Fortepiano]], the fore-runner of the modern [[Piano]], was invented by [[Bartolomeo Cristofori]] in Florence around 1725, and soon replaced the harpsichord as a solo and ensemble keyboard instrument.

The family of stringed instruments, consisting of the violin, viola, cello and contrabass evolved in Italy in the mid 16th century.  [[Antonio Stradivari]], [[Andrea Guarneri]], [[Nicolo Amati]] and other [[History of the violin|master instrument makers]] crafted stringed instruments that were highly prized, widely imitated, but never equaled.

The education of upper-class young man was expected to be completed by a "grand tour" of Italy to be exposed to the visible legacies of its classical culture, as well as to its contemporary culture of music, literature, art and architecture. Famous examples included [[Goethe]], [[Keats]], [[Lord Byron]] and [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]].  Many of the nobility and royalty of the time visited Italy as a part of their education. Keats said that the country was a "paradise of exiles”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=9332&amp;st=&amp;st1=|title=John F. Kennedy: Remarks in Naples at NATO Headquarters.|website=www.presidency.ucsb.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Ruskin]] was a Victorian Italophile who respected the concepts of morality held in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, A. N. ''The Victorians''. New York, New York, USA: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, Ltd, 2003. Pp. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

Italian universities and medical schools attracted students and scholars from across Europe.  Luminaries, such as [[Copernicus]] and [[William Harvey|Harvey]], were educated in Italy.

At the end of the eighteenth century, Italiophilia was not uncommon among the founders of the United States, and some of the creators of the U.S. Constitution, such as [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[Benjamin Franklin]], looked to Roman models upon which to base the American systems of government and law.&lt;ref&gt;https://news.yahoo.com/italys-role-us-independence-honored-170938982.html&lt;/ref&gt; The founding fathers were also interested in Renaissance political thinkers and humanists like Machiavelli, and how Italian republics functioned.  Jefferson was among the most conspicuous of the early American Italophiles.&lt;ref&gt;''The Italian American Experience'', Salvatore LaGumina, ed., Garland Publishing, Inc., New York, 2000, pg. 305&lt;/ref&gt; He was especially impressed with Italian architecture, and based the design of his Virginia residence, Monticello, on prints by [[Palladio]], the 16th-century Italian architect.&lt;ref&gt;Mangione, Jerre and Morreale, Ben, ''La Storia, Five Centuries of the Italian American Experience'', Harper Perennial, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Jefferson Memorial]] in Washington DC, erected in honor of Jefferson, is a neo-Palladian imitation of the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] in Rome.  The Palladian style of architecture appears elsewhere in the U.S. Capital, and the White House itself was inspired by it.  (Congressional Resolution n. 259 of 6 December 2010 recognized Palladio as Father of American Architecture.)

The influence of Italian culture and artistry during this era is expressed by Barzini:&lt;ref&gt;Barzini, Luigi, ''The Italians'', A Bantom Book, 1965&lt;/ref&gt;
: ''Italian architects and masons built part of the Kremlin in Moscow, and the Winter Palace in Leningrad.  Italian artists embellished the Capital in Washington.  They have strewn churches, princely palaces and stately villas all over Catholic Europe, especially in Vienna, Madrid, Prague and Warsaw.  Their influence on architecture was felt almost everywhere.  They taught poetry, statesmanship and trade to the English; military art to the Germans; cuisine to the French; acting and ballet to the Russians; and music to everyone.

== Modern era ==
[[File:Guglielmo Marconi.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Guglielmo Marconi]], a pioneer in the development of [[wireless telegraphy]] and long-distance radio transmissions.]]
In 1861 Italy was united for the first time since the fall of the Roman Empire and became a [[Economy of Italy|modern industrialized country]], where the tradition of creativity, scientific achievement and excellence in manufacturing continued.
[[File:Enrico Fermi 1943-49.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Enrico Fermi]], pioneer of nuclear power.]]
[[Giuseppe Garibaldi]], a central figure in achieving Italian independence, was called the "Hero of Two Worlds" because of his military enterprises to achieve independence for countries in South America as well. Garibaldi was admired by many of the greatest intellectuals of his time, such as [[Victor Hugo]], [[Alexandre Dumas]], and [[George Sand]].

[[Maria Montessori]], born in 1870, was a physician and educator who became known around the world for the educational method that bears her name, and for her writings on pedagogy. Her methods are in use today in schools throughout the world.

Toward the end of the 19th century, mathematicians [[Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro]] and [[Tullio Levi-Civita]] developed [[tensor calculus]], which provided the mathematical framework for Einstein's [[General Theory of Relativity]] in the early 20th century.

In the early 20th century [[Pirandello]], a [[Nobel Laureate]], was the first European playwright to radically question the structures of traditional theatre. Since then, film directors and writers such as [[Federico Fellini|Fellini]], [[Michelangelo Antonioni|Antonioni]], [[Pier Paolo Pasolini|Pasolini]], [[Italo Calvino|Calvino]], [[Umberto Eco|Eco]] and [[Dario Fo|Fo]] have been recognized around the world.  [[Italian neorealism]] in films, beginning after the second world war, had a great impact on audiences around the world, and established a new philosophy of filmmaking adopted worldwide.

The legacy of Italian scientists [[Enrico Fermi|Fermi]] (nuclear power), [[Antonio Meucci|Meucci]] (telephone), and [[Guglielmo Marconi|Marconi]] (radio), whose discoveries and inventions transformed the world, is widely recognized. At the same time that German scientists were making major advancements in physics, beginning with [[Max Planck]], Italian scientists like Fermi's [[Via Panisperna boys|Via Panisperna]] group in Rome were making important fundamental discoveries in physics as well.  

The first public flight of a jet-engined aircraft was that of the Italian Caproni Campini N.1 prototype on August 27, 1940.  Italy was the fourth country in the world to build nuclear power plants, starting in 1955 (now decommissioned due to a popular referendum in 1987), and the third, after The United States and The Soviet Union, to launch a scientific earth satellite in the 1964 [[San Marco programme]], using an American [[Scout (rocket family)|Scout missile]] as the launch vehicle. The [[Broglio Space Centre]], located on a [[Jackup_rig#Barges|sea platform]] offshore the [[Kenya]] coast is the only example of a spacecraft launch center built on a floating sea platform. 

Italian companies have developed products that are of fundamental importance in contemporary society, such as the [[Olivetti]]-developed transistorized [[mainframe computer]] systems ([[Olivetti Elea]]) and, in 1964, the world's first commercial [[desktop computer]], the [[Programma 101]], invented by [[Pier Giorgio Perotto]].

Today, Italy is admired throughout the world for its design, particularly in the areas of fashion and manufactured goods. Italian fashions by [[Gucci]], [[Benetton Group|Benetton]], [[Armani]], [[Valentino SpA|Valentino]], [[Prada]], [[Dolce &amp; Gabbana]], [[Ferragamo]] and [[Versace]] are known worldwide.  In automobile design, the brand names [[Ferrari]], [[Lamborghini]] and [[Maserati]] are known and admired throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourguidetoitaly.com/ferrari-sports-cars.html|title=Ferrari (Ferrari Sports Cars)|website=www.yourguidetoitaly.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Britain in the 1960s the emerging [[Mod (subculture)|mod subculture]] championed Italian and French design, with mods adopting the [[Vespa GS]] and the [[Lambretta Li 125 Special|Lambretta LI 150]] motor scooters as their preferred means of transport as well as wearing Italian-designed clothes and shoes, and had a lasting effect - Britain remains Vespa's largest market outside of Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/culture/story/20131122-the-vespa-motoring-with-style |title=The Vespa: How a motor scooter became stylish |last=Glancey |first=Jonathan|author-link=Jonathan Glancey |date=22 November 2013|website=[[bbc.co.uk]]|access-date=19 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/music/the-mods-are-back-but-who-were-they/article4479191/ |title=The Mods are back, but who were they? |last1=Wheeler |first1=Brad|date=13 August 2012 |website=[[theglobeandmail.com]] |access-date=19 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Italian design and manufacturing in furniture, architecture and interior design is appreciated worldwide.  Architects like [[Renzo Piano]] have designed important modern buildings such as [[Centre Pompidou]] in [[Paris]] and [[Kansai International Airport]] in [[Osaka]]. Architect and designer [[Giò Ponti]] was a pioneer in industrial design, and inspired many other Italian designers who have established the Italian image of design excellence in the world.  Designers such as [[Ettore Sottsass]], and his [[Memphis Group]] of designers, are famous for creating [[Postmodernism|postmodern]] furniture, fabrics, ceramics, glass and metal objects; and lighting manufacturer [[Artemide]] is famous for lamps which transcend their common use as objects, and are nowadays considered cult manufacturing artworks, collected in [[Museum of Modern Art|Museums of Modern Art]].

Italy ranks among the world’s most popular tourist destinations, with about 45 million tourists visiting the country every year.  Italy has forty-seven [[UNESCO World Heritage Sites]], more than any other country.  It is also home to a large number of religious sites that draw people from all parts of the world.  According to UNESCO, the cultural and educational agency for the United Nations, over 60 percent of the entire world’s art treasures are found in Italy, &lt;ref&gt;http://www.aboutflorence.com/art-and-culture-of-Florence.html&lt;/ref&gt; which draws tourists, scholars, artists and art historians from everywhere in the world. Many are drawn to Rome, still known as the "Eternal City," for its history, culture and the fact that [[Vatican City]], the center of world-wide Catholicism, is located there. Other places in Italy that attract many tourists are Venice, Florence, and sites associated with [[Padre Pio]] and [[Francis of Assisi]].

The descendants of Italian immigrants to the countries of North and South America, in many cases, still retain an appreciation of their Italian roots, culture and traditions.  Italophilia is actively fostered by organizations such as the [[Order Sons of Italy in America]], the [[National Italian American Foundation]], the [[Dante Alighieri Society]] and the Italic Institute of America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.italic.org|title=Italic Institute of America, Italian Heritage, Italian American Heritage|website=www.italic.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Giorgio Silvestri (director of the "Assemblea legislativa della Liguria") has conjectured that there are nearly 250 million Italophiles in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globusetlocuseng.org/What_We_Do/Research/The_Italic_Project.kl|title=The Italics Project|website=www.globusetlocuseng.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kim Crosbie''' is a former Executive Director of the [[International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators]] (IAATO)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iaato.org|title=Home|last=|first=|date=|website=iaato.org|publisher=International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators|access-date=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been working in the polar regions since 1991.

== Early life and education ==
Crosbie is from Edinburgh, Scotland, and she completed her undergraduate degree in Geography at the [[University of Aberdeen]]. In 1991 Crosbie began conducting post-Graduate research at the Scott Polar Research Institute ([[Scott Polar Research Institute|SPRI]]) at the [[University of Cambridge]], where she gained an M.Phil. in environmental protection in the Canadian Arctic.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She then embarked on a PhD that focused on the ecological monitoring and management of visitor sites in the Antarctic. This required three austral summer seasons in primitive conditions at a temporary field camp on [[Cuverville Island]] in the Antarctic Peninsula surrounded by some 4,500 breeding pairs of [[gentoo penguin]]s.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.mercopress.com/2016/01/13/iaato-executive-director-and-falklands-resident-awarded-the-queen-s-polar-medal|title=IAATO Executive Director and Falklands' resident awarded the Queen's Polar Medal|last=|first=|date=2016|website=en.mercopress.com|publisher=Merco Press|access-date=2016-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, Crosbie  spent two seasons as field camp leader at a small temporary field camp.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iaato.org/the-secretariat|title=The Secretariat|last=|first=|date=|website=iaato.org|publisher=International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators|access-date=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following completion of her PhD, Crosbie remained in the field of visitor management, leading expeditions to the Arctic and the Antarctic,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.quarkexpeditions.com/all-about-the-international-association-of-antarctica-tour-operators|title=All about the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators|last=|first=|date=2013|website=quarkexpeditions.com|publisher=Quark Expeditions|access-date=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; primarily onboard expedition vessels, supporting groups of students, film makers, authors, artists and those simply interested in experiencing these unique environments in a sustainable way. She has subsequently described how such Antarctic tourism programmes "enrich a visitor’s experience of Antarctica by getting them involved and contributing to something bigger."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/travel-leisure/article/1898514/hong-kong-citizen-scientists-help-antarctic-climate-change|title=Hong Kong citizen scientists help Antarctic climate change fight|last=|first=|date=2016|website=scmp.com|publisher=[[South China Morning Post]]|access-date=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career and impact ==
Crosbie's Polar career began in 1991 when she joined the [[Scott Polar Research Institute]], University of Cambridge, as a research student and member of [[St. Catharine's College, Cambridge]]. Initially working in the Canadian Arctic, she attributes her love of cold places to growing up in Scotland.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/environment/scots-scientist-wins-prize-for-groundbreaking-antarctica-work-1-4003238|title=Scots scientist wins prize for groundbreaking Antarctica work|last=|first=|date=2016|website=scotsman.com|publisher=Scotsman|access-date=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, Crosbie joined the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO) as Environmental Manager and subsequently Operations Director before being appointed Executive Director in 2013.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; As Executive Director, Crosbie is responsible for the Association's strategic planning process, including sustainable tourism growth management strategies. Crosbie also directs IAATO's efforts with the [[Antarctic Treaty System|Antarctic Treaty]] Parties and other government bodies relevant to Antarctic tourism, including the [[International Maritime Organization]] (for instance, working on the Polar Code, which was adopted in 2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iaato.org/documents/10157/853702/Polar+Code+Workshop/9fbc3842-3c10-47a8-94c5-480d59203999|title=Facing the Challenge – a joint IAATO-Lloyd’s Register workshop to prepare for the Polar Code|last=|first=|date=2015|website=iaato.org|publisher=International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crosbie has published scientific papers and books with a diverse range of scientists and non-governmental representatives. Aspects of this work have contributed to the development of a series of visitor site guidelines both in the Antarctic and the small sub-Antarctic island of [[South Georgia Island|South Georgia]], as well as guidelines on wildlife and tourism&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.zoology.ubc.ca/~consort/MMRU/williams/tme70.pdf|title=Antarctic Whales and Antarctic Tourism|last=|first=|date=2007|website=zoology.ubc.ca|publisher=Tourism in Marine Environments|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the use of new technologies such as [[Unmanned Aerial Vehicles]] (UAVs).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.maritime-executive.com/article/guidelines-for-drone-use-in-antarctica-underway|title=Guidelines for Drone Use in Antarctica Underway|last=|first=|date=2014|website=maritime-executive.com|publisher=The Maritime Executive|access-date=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crosbie has also addressed the topic of citizen science, outreach and education: "This is more an opportunity than a challenge through citizen science, creating ambassadors for the continued protection of Antarctica and building on education efforts through social media and elsewhere."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.maritime-executive.com/article/polar-operators-keen-on-citizen-science|title=Polar Operators Keen on Citizen Science|last=|first=|date=2015|website=maritime-executive.com|publisher=The Maritime Executive|access-date=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honors==
In 2016, Crosbie was awarded the [[Polar Medal]] for contributions to knowledge in the Arctic and the Antarctic.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The '''Kimbundu languages''' are a group of [[Bantu languages]] coded Zone H.20 in Guthrie's classification. According to Nurse &amp; Philippson (2003), they probably form a valid node, though this is still uncertain. They are:
: [[Kimbundu language|Kimbundu]] (Mbundu), [[Sama language (Angola)|Sama]], [[Bolo language|Bolo]]. 

[[Songo language|Songo]] is often assumed to be a dialect of Kimbundu, but actually appears to be one of the [[Teke languages]]. [[Ngoya language|Ngoya]] to its south was until recently considered a dialect of Kimbundu, but has now been recognized as a language in own right, and may be transitional between Kimbundu and Umbundu.&lt;ref name=RELV&gt;Angenot et al.

The '''Liechtenstein identity card''' (in [[German language|German]]: ''Identitätskarte Liechtenstein'') is issued to Liechtenstein citizens by the Immigration and Passport Office in [[Vaduz]]. The card costs CHF80 for adults aged 15 or over and is valid for 10 years. For children, the card costs CHF30 and has a validity of 3 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.llv.li/amtsstellen/llv-apa-identitaetskarte/llv-apa-identitaetskarte-liechtensteinische_identitaetskarte.htm Ausländer- und Passamt: Liechtensteinische Identitätskarte] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111114091653/http://www.llv.li/amtsstellen/llv-apa-identitaetskarte/llv-apa-identitaetskarte-liechtensteinische_identitaetskarte.htm |date=2011-11-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{NSA surveillance}}
'''OAKSTAR''' is a secret internet surveillance program of the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) of the United States. It was disclosed in 2013 as part of the leaks by former NSA contractor [[Edward Snowden]].

OAKSTAR is an umbrella program involving surveillance of telecommunications, it falls under the category of "[[Upstream collection]]", meaning that data is pulled directly from fiber-optic cables and top-level communications infrastructure.&lt;ref name=fantastico1&gt;{{cite web | url=http://g1.globo.com/fantastico/noticia/2013/09/nsa-documents-show-united-states-spied-brazilian-oil-giant.html | title=NSA Documents Show United States Spied Brazilian Oil Giant | author=Fantástico | work=Fantástico | publisher=O Globo | date=2013-09-08 | accessdate=2014-03-23 | archivedate=March 23, 2014 | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6OHdKRngr?url=http://g1.globo.com/fantastico/noticia/2013/09/nsa-documents-show-united-states-spied-brazilian-oil-giant.html | deadurl=yes | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Really screengrabs in the attached video, they are exposed for only a few frames each--&gt;&lt;ref name="wp_slides"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/politics/prism-collection-documents/ | title=NSA slides explain the PRISM data-collection program | author=The Washington Post | work=The Washington Post | date=2013-06-06 | accessdate=2014-03-23 | archivedate=March 23, 2014 | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6OHdX5Sif?url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/politics/prism-collection-documents/ | deadurl=yes | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Upstream collection programs allow access to very high volumes of data, and most of the pre-selection is done by the providers themselves, before the data is passed on to the NSA.

'''Peeping Tom''' is a [[theatre]] company founded by Gabriela Carrizo (I/AR) and Franck Chartier (F) in 2000. The pair created a first location project that was taking place in a trailer home, Caravana (1999), with would-be long-time collaborator Eurudike De Beul, followed by the film Une vie inutile (2000).

Peeping Tom’s hallmark is a hyperrealistic aesthetic anchored to a concrete set: a garden, a living room and a basement in the first trilogy ( Le Jardin , 2001; Le Salon , 2004; and Le Sous Sol , 2007), two trailer homes in a snow-covered landscape in 32 rue Vandenbranden (2009), or a burned theatre in A Louer (2011). In these, the directors create an unstable universe that defies the logic of time and space. Isolation leads to an unconscious world of nightmares, fears and desires, which the creators deftly use to shed light on the dark side of a character or a community. The huis clos of family situations remains for Peeping Tom a major source of creativity. The company has started working on a second trilogy – Vader (Father), Moeder (Mother), Kinderen (Children) – around this theme, with Vader (Father) already having premiered.

In 2005, Le Salon was awarded the Prix du Meilleur Spectacle de Danse (Best Dance Show Prize) in France. In 2007, the company received the Mont Blanc Young Directors Award during the [[Salzburg Festival]] and the Patrons Circle Award at the [[Melbourne International Arts Festival]]. The pieces Le Sous Sol and A Louer were both selected for the Theaterfestival, which gathers the best shows of the season in Belgium and The Netherlands. In 2013, A Louer was nominated for the prestigious Ubu Awards in Italy, in the category Best Performance in Foreign Language, during the theatrical season 2012-2013. 32 rue Vandenbranden was elected Best Dance Show of the Year 2013 in São Paulo (BR) by magazine Guia Folha and won in 2015 a prestigious Olivier Award, in the category 'Best New Dance Production'.

Peeping Tom's latest production, Vader (Father), is the first part of the trilogy Father-Mother-Children. It premiered on 10 May 2014 in Theater im Pfalzbau (Ludwigshafen, DE) and was elected Best Dance Performance of 2014 by Dutch newspaper [[NRC Handelsblad]]. The jury of the 'Premios de la Crítica Barcelona' awarded Vader in its turn with a first prize in the category 'Best International Dance Production of 2014'.

[[File:British Isles - UK &amp; Ireland.png|thumb|upright=1.5|right|The sovereign states, dependencies and [[Countries of the United Kingdom|countries]] in the British Isles]]

The [[British Isles]] comprise two [[sovereign states]], [[Republic of Ireland]]  and the [[United Kingdom]], and [[Crown dependencies|three dependencies of the British Crown]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.justice.gov.uk/downloads/about/moj/our-responsibilities/Background_Briefing_on_the_Crown_Dependencies2.pdf|title=Background briefing on the Crown Dependencies: Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man|publisher=Ministry of Justice, UK}} "Government officials must never state or imply that the Crown Dependencies are part of the United Kingdom, or Great Britain or England or act on that assumption."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=justicecommittee&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmselect/cmjust/56/56i.pdf|title=House of Commons Justice Committee: Crown Dependencies: Eighth Report of Session 2009–10|date=March 30, 2010|publisher=House of Commons}} 7. The Bailiwicks of Jersey and Guernsey and the Isle of Man are Dependencies of the Crown, with Her Majesty The Queen as Sovereign.2 The Sovereign is represented in each jurisdiction by a Lieutenant Governor. Although they are proud of their British associations, the Crown Dependencies are not part of the United Kingdom and are
autonomous and self-governing, with their own, independent legal, administrative and fiscal systems. The Island parliaments legislate for themselves. UK legislation and international treaties are only extended to them with their consent. It has been argued that Westminster retains a residual legislative power over the Islands in order to avoid “the impossible position of having responsibility without power”. We are not aware of any example in recent times of such a power being exercised. …&lt;br /&gt;Her Majesty the Queen is Sovereign in each of the Crown Dependencies for historical reasons which are different for each Island. In each case, however, she executes her responsibilities for the Crown Dependencies on the advice of her Privy Council and her executive responsibilities are carried out by Her Majesty’s Government. Within HM Government, the Ministry of Justice is the point of contact for the Crown Dependencies, and communications in both directions are passed through its offices. Whilst this inquiry deals with the relationship between the Ministry of Justice and the Crown Dependencies, it is important to realise that their relationship is technically with the Crown and that HM Government’s responsibilities are derived from this fact.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Guernsey]], [[Jersey]] and the [[Isle of Man]].

Ireland is a [[unitary state]] and a republic. Since 1998, it shares certain common institutions with [[Northern Ireland]], in the United Kingdom, from which it was [[Partition of Ireland|partitioned]] in 1921. The United Kingdom is a [[constitutional monarchy]] and also a unitary state&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=British politics|first1=Dennis|last1=Kavanagh|first2=David|last2=Richards|first3=Andrew|last3=Geddes|first4=Martin|last4=Smith|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=2006|page=323|isbn=9780199269792|quote=Although the United Kingdom is composed of four nations it is a unitary state. Laws are passed by the Westminster Parliament and by the Scottish Parliament. The state is governed from London. Any power exercised by subordinate authorities is bestowed by, and can likewise be taken away by, Parliament.}}&lt;/ref&gt; comprising [[England]], [[Scotland]], [[Wales]], and Northern Ireland. Also since 1998, the United Kingdom has [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|devolved]] significant domestic powers (though differing in extent) to administrations in [[Northern Ireland Executive|Northern Ireland]], [[Scottish Government|Scotland]] and [[Government of Wales|Wales]]. [[Jersey]], the [[Isle of Man]], and [[Guernsey]] (including its two semi-autonomous territories of [[Alderney]] and [[Sark]]), are collectively known as the [[Crown Dependencies]]; although not part of the United Kingdom, the UK is responsible for their defence and international relations on behalf of the [[British Crown]].&lt;ref name="bradley"&gt;{{citation|title=Constitutional and Administrative Law|volume=Volume 1|author1=Anthony Wilfred Bradley|author2=Keith D.

For this purpose the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is the state, with authority to act also for its dependent possessions, such as the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man and its surviving overseas territories, such as Gibraltar, none of which is a state at international law.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=backgroundbrief&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov.uk/downloads/about/moj/our-responsibilities/Background_Briefing_on_the_Crown_Dependencies2.pdf|author=Ministry of Justice|title=Background briefing on the Crown Dependencies: Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man|quote=The UK Government is responsible for defence and international representation of the Crown Dependencies. In certain circumstances, the Crown Dependencies may be authorised to conclude their own international agreements ... within the terms of Letters of Entrustment issued to their Governments under the signature of the appropriate UK Minister.&lt;br /&gt;However, being responsible for the Crown Dependencies’ international representation is not limited to simply entering international agreements; it should be read to include any international or external relations whether or not they result in some internationally binding agreement.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, as part of the [[Good Friday Agreement]], Ireland and the United Kingdom established a number of organisations, including the [[British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference]] and the [[British-Irish Council]], the latter being a [[multilateralism|multilateral]] body in which both sovereign states, the three devolved administrations of the UK and the three Crown dependencies participate. Additionally, there are numerous relations between the countries in the British Isles, including formal and informal bilateral and multilateral relations between Ireland, the devolved administrations of the UK, and the crown dependencies, as well as shared cultural and economic links.

{{See also|Terminology of the British Isles}}

The British Isles contain two [[sovereign states]]:
* [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], also known as the Republic of Ireland
* the [[United Kingdom]], within which certain powers are devolved:
** to the [[Scottish Government]], [[Welsh Government]], and the [[Northern Ireland Executive]]

The archipelago also contains three [[Crown dependencies]]:
* [[Jersey]], [[Isle of Man]], and [[Guernsey]], which contains the somewhat autonomous [[Alderney]] and [[Sark]].

The Crown dependencies are constitutionally linked to the United Kingdom but independent of it.

===Ireland===
{{Main article|Politics of the Republic of Ireland}}

[[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] is a [[parliamentary republic]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Constitutional Law of 15 EU Member States|author1=L. Prakke|author2=C. A. J. M. Kortmann|author3=J. C. E. van den Brandhof|publisher=Kluwer|location=Deventer|page=429|quote=Since 1937, Ireland has been a parliamentary republic, in which ministers appointed by the president depend on the confidence of parliament|year=2004|isbn=9013012558}}&lt;/ref&gt; comprising approximately five sixths of the [[island of Ireland]] in the west of the archipelago.

The [[island of Ireland]] was partitioned in 1920 with the Government of Ireland Act into the 26 counties of Southern Ireland and the six counties of Northern Ireland. In 1921 Southern Ireland was renamed the Irish Free State when it gained independence from the United Kingdom following the Irish War of Independence. Since the passage in 1949 of the [[Republic of Ireland Act]], the [[Republic of Ireland]] is no longer part of the commonwealth.

===United Kingdom===
{{Main article|Politics of the United Kingdom}}
The [[United Kingdom]] is a [[constitutional monarchy]] that covers the whole of the island of [[Great Britain]] in the east of the archipelago, a north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and [[List of islands of the British Isles|many smaller surrounding islands]] including [[Orkney]] and [[Shetland]].

The United Kingdom comprises four parts: the countries of [[England]], [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]] and the province of [[Northern Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_3166-2_newsletter_ii-3_2011-12-13.pdf|title=Changes in the list of subdivision names and code elements|work=ISO 3166-2|publisher=International Organization for Standardization|date=15 December 2011|accessdate=28 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; All but Northern Ireland have been independent states at one point and each have their own history and sense of identity.

====Devolution====
{{Main article|Devolution in the United Kingdom}}
Northern Ireland has had a degree of self-government for most of the time since 1921. In 1998, following referendums in Scotland, Wales, and both parts of Ireland, a range of powers were [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|transferred]] to [[Scottish Government|Scotland]] and [[Welsh Government|Wales]] as well as restoring self-government in [[Northern Ireland Executive]]. England does not have self-government.

===Crown dependencies===
{{Main article|Crown dependencies|Politics of Guernsey|Politics of Jersey|Politics of the Isle of Man}}

The [[Crown dependencies]] of [[Guernsey]] and [[Jersey]], in the south of the archipelago (and geographically closer to France), and the [[Isle of Man]], in the Irish Sea between Great Britain and Ireland, are self-governing states but independent. The Bailiwick of Guernsey furthermore contains two smaller islands, which also have a certain degree of autonomy: [[Sark]] and [[Alderney]].

The Crown dependencies are not part of the [[United Kingdom]]. They are administered independently by their own governments, legislatures and judiciaries, but are not sovereign. The United Kingdom, on behalf of the British Crown, is responsible for their international relations and defence, and the [[British Crown|Crown]] is ultimately responsible for their good governance.&lt;ref name="royal-channel-islands"&gt;{{cite web|title=Channel Islands|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/QueenandCrowndependencies/ChannelIslands.aspx|work=Website of the British Monarchy|accessdate=17 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can be legislated for from the Parliament of the United Kingdom, although in practice the UK rarely exercises this power.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=David|last=Feldman|title=English Public Law|quote=Three 'Crown dependencies' - the Bailiwicks of Jersey and Guernsey, and the Isle of Man - have a distinct constitutional position, arising from an historical association with the Crown rather than by reason of being colonies. The British Overseas Territories and the Crown dependencies are not part of the United Kingdom but the Crown as responsibility for their international affairs. The UK Parliament asserts power to legislate for them.|page=38|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=2010|isbn=0199227934}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Crown dependencies are not part of the United Kingdom, residents of the Isle of Man, Jersey and Guernsey are nonetheless considered British citizens, and European Union citizens by extension (with some exceptions), and are given British passports (albeit with a special cover for each Crown dependency). Nevertheless, British citizens from outside of each Crown dependency and Irish citizens may require work permits in order to work on the islands&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.im/cso/immigration/faqs.xml#20|title=Immigration, Passports and Nationality FAQs}}&lt;/ref&gt; although usually this is merely a formality. There have been discussions within some of the Crown dependencies about greater independence from the Crown, but they have not yet gained strong popular or governmental support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Simon Tostevin|title=Independence: Islanders don't want it, says Trott|newspaper=Guernsey Evening Press|date=9 July 2008|url=http://www.thisisguernsey.com/2008/07/09/independence-islanders-dont-want-it-says-trott/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;

===Multilateral relations===
The main body for multilateral international relations in the islands, since 1998, is the [[British–Irish Council]]. The British-Irish Council ('''BIC''') is an [[international organisation]]&lt;ref&gt;Jesse, Neal G., Williams, Kristen P.: ''Identity and institutions: conflict reduction in divided societies''.Publisher: SUNY Press, 2005, page 107. {{ISBN|0-7914-6451-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; established under the [[Belfast Agreement]] in 1998. Its membership comprises representatives from:
* The two [[Sovereign state|sovereign]] governments of [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and the [[United Kingdom]]
* The three [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|devolved administrations]] of [[Northern Ireland]], [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]]
* The [[crown dependencies]] of [[Guernsey]], the [[Isle of Man]] and [[Jersey]].

The Council formally came into being on 2 December 1999. Its stated aim is to "promote the harmonious and mutually beneficial development of the totality of relationships among the peoples of these islands". The BIC has a standing secretariat, located in [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]], and meets in bi-annual summit session and regular [[Government minister|ministerial]] meetings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Releases/2010/06/25144630 "Scottish government website"]&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that the BIC provides a more equitable forum for participation of the devolved administrations than the UK-only Joint Ministerial Council, and that it has created a "novel political and administrative space for intergovernmental co-operation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-856X.2011.00503.x/full|title=Intergovernmental Relations and Political Parties in Northern Ireland|doi=10.1111/j.1467-856X.2011.00503.x|journal=The British Journal of Politics &amp; International Relations|author=Derek Birrell|volume=14|issue= 2|pages=270–284|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers have compared the British-Irish council to similar multilateral bodies amongst the Nordic countries: the [[Nordic Council]] and the [[Nordic Council of Ministers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The British-Irish Council: Nordic Lessons for the Council of the Isles|author1=Qvortrup, M  |author2=Hazell, R |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1998|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/spp/publications/unit-publications/28.pdf|publisher=University College London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly
In addition to the council, there is also the [[British–Irish Parliamentary Assembly]] ('''BIPA'''), a deliberative body consisting of members of legislative bodies in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], and the British [[crown dependency|crown dependencies]]. Its purpose is to foster common understanding between elected representatives from these jurisdictions.

The assembly consists of 25 members of each of the two sovereign parliaments: the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] and the [[Oireachtas]] (the Irish parliament). It also includes as five representatives from the [[Scottish Parliament]], five from the [[National Assembly for Wales]], five from the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]], and one each from the [[States of Jersey]], the [[States of Guernsey]] and the [[Tynwald]] of the [[Isle of Man]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Members |url=http://www.britishirish.org/members-2/ |work=British Irish Parliamentary Assembly website |accessdate=17 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Common travel area
Various arrangements over the years have led to the development of the [[Common Travel Area]], a passport-free zone that comprises the islands of [[Ireland]], [[Great Britain]], the [[Isle of Man]] and the [[Channel Islands]]. The area's internal borders are subject to minimal or non-existent border controls and can normally be crossed by Irish and British citizens with only minimal [[identity document]]s, if any.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/moving_country/moving_abroad/freedom_of_movement_within_the_eu/common_travel_area_between_ireland_and_the_uk.html |title=Common Travel Area between Ireland and the United Kingdom |publisher=Citizens Information Board |accessdate=12 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Inter-island relations
The three crown dependencies, while independent, share a relatively similar position with respect to the United Kingdom and with international bodies such as the EU or the OECD. As a result, the crown dependencies work together on areas of mutual interest. For example, in 2000, the three states cooperated on development of common policies for offshore banking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tax-news.com/news/Crown_Dependencies_Join_Forces_On_Money_Laundering_With_New_Know_Your_Customer_Principles____1569.html|title=Crown Dependencies Join Forces On Money Laundering With New "Know Your Customer" Principles|date=20 December 2000|journal=Tax-News.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, they developed a joint approach to certain EU activities around tax information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tax-news.com/news/Channel_Isles_And_IoM_Discuss_Joint_Approach_To_EU_Tax_Directive____13175.html|title=Channel Isles And IoM Discuss Joint Approach To EU Tax Directive|date=2 September 2003|journal=Tax-News.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iomtoday.co.im/news/business/joint-approach-needed-to-eu-1-1748396|title=JOINT APPROACH NEEDED TO EU |journal=Isle of Man Today|date=1 Sep 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The heads of government of the crown dependencies, including Isle of Man, Guernsey, Alderney, Sark, and Jersey, meet at an annual ''inter-island'' summit, to discuss matters of common concern, such as financial regulation and relations with the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Positive' meeting at Inter-Island conference.|date=7 Sep 2007|journal=Isle of Man Newspapers}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ifcfeed.com/articles/detail.aspx?articleid=2243|title=Inter-island crown dependencies meeting|journal=IFCFeed.com|date=28 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tax-news.com/news/Crown_Dependencies_Summit_Held____55673.html|title=Crown Dependencies Summit Held|date=30 May 2012|journal=Tax-News.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 January 2013 Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man signed [[double taxation]] agreements with each other (in the case of Jersey and Guernsey, updating the existing agreement) .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Double Tax Agreements with Guernsey and Isle of Man|url=http://www.gov.je/News/2013/pages/DoubleTaxAgreementGuernseyIoM.aspx|accessdate=24 January 2013|date=24 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was the first time all three Crown Dependencies had established such mutual agrrements which also included provision for exchange of tax information equivalent to [[TIEA]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Guernsey, Jersey and Isle of Man sign taxation agreement|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-guernsey-21185263|accessdate=24 January 2013|newspaper=BBC|date=24 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bilateral relations===
{{expand section|Needs a paragraph on anglo-irish relations here|date=June 2012}}
{{see also|Ireland-United Kingdom relations|Ireland–Isle of Man relations}}
Besides the dominant strand of [[Anglo-Irish relations]] (also known as the East-West strand or the Dublin-London axis), other bilateral relations exist between the various countries in the archipelago. Indeed, fostering such bilateral and multilateral relations between the countries was an explicit goal of the British Irish council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishirishcouncil.org/agreement-reached-multi-party-negotiations/strand-3-british-irish-council-and-intergovernmental|title=Strand 3: British-Irish Council and intergovernmental conference|accessdate=June 21, 2012}} 10. In addition to the structures provided for under this agreement, it will be open to two or more members to develop bilateral or multilateral arrangements between them. Such arrangements could include, subject to the agreement of the members concerned, mechanisms to enable consultation, co-operation and joint decision-making on matters of mutual interest; and mechanisms to implement any joint decisions they may reach. These arrangements will not require the prior approval of the BIC as a whole and will operate independently of it.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Note: Ireland and the United Kingdom are the only sovereign states in the archipelago; thus '''formal''' bilateral state-to-state relations (i.e. treaties, formal diplomatic exchanges, etc) only occur between them. However, many sources refer to bilateral relations as being broader than just sovereign state-to-state relations, so that is the sense in which the term '''bilateral''' is used here.&lt;/ref&gt;

One important body is the [[North/South Ministerial Council]] (NSMC) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northsouthministerialcouncil.org/annual_report_2010_ulster_scots.pdf|title=North-South Ministerial Council: 2010 Yeirlie Din|publisher=North/South Ministerial Council|location=Armagh|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; a body established by the British and Irish governments under the [[Good Friday Agreement]] to co-ordinate activity and exercise certain governmental powers across the whole island of [[Ireland]]. The Council takes the form of meetings between ministers from both the [[Republic of Ireland]] and [[Northern Ireland]] and is responsible for twelve policy areas. Six of these areas are the responsibility of corresponding North/South Implementation Bodies.

The [[Republic of Ireland]] has also established bilateral relations with three [[Crown dependencies]]: the [[Ireland-Isle of Man relations|Isle of Man]], [[Ireland–Jersey relations|Jersey]] and [[Ireland–Jersey relations|Guernsey]], for example through the signing of various bilateral tax agreements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/cm79/7965/7965.pdf|title=Government Response to the Justice Select Committee's report: Crown Dependencies|date=November 2010|publisher=Ministry of Justice}} Besides informal ties, Ireland has signed formal tax agreements with all of the Crown dependencies. The UK government has called these ''bilateral'' relationships - from the source: "The Government agrees with the Committee’s views on the increased use of entrustment. We consider the system of entrustment to have worked well so far. It has enabled the Crown Dependencies to negotiate and conclude numerous tax agreements with OECD, EU and G20 countries. They have been able to build important bilateral and multi lateral international relationships and to develop reputation, profile and credibility with international partners and overarching sovereign bodies."&lt;/ref&gt;

The crown dependencies are also pursuing direct linkages with other countries in the Isles. For example, Scotland's first minister was invited to the Isle of Man in 2008, the first such visit of a Scottish minister to the Island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.im/MNH//heritage/countryside/ViewNews.gov?page=lib/news/cso/chiefministerwel1.xml&amp;menuid=11570|title=Chief Minister welcomes Scottish Government Minister|date=March 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the two governments had a dispute over Isle of Man government laws restricting scallop fishing in the Irish sea, which were seen as unfair to Scottish fishermen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-isle-of-man-11797216|title=Scottish minister hits out at Manx scallop fishing ban|date=19 November 2010|journal=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2011 the government of Jersey has sent representatives to the main party conferences of the United Kingdom, its "most significant economic partner", as part of a commitment to enhancing political engagement with the UK. In 2012 the Assistant Chief Minister attended the conference of the UK Liberal Democrats, the Chief Minister attended the [[Labour Party (UK) Conference|UK Labour Party conference]], and the Deputy Chief Minister and Treasury and Resources Minister were announced to attend the UK Conservative Party conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jersey represented at Lib Dems conference|url=http://www.gov.je/News/2012/Pages/LibDemConference.aspx|publisher=States of Jersey|accessdate=4 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Deputy Chief Minister of Guernsey also attended the UK Liberal Democrats conference in 2012 to communicate the message that "Guernsey and the Channel Islands are good neighbours to the UK".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Deputy Chief Minister welcomes growing understanding of Guernsey at the Lib Dem Conference|url=http://www.gov.gg/article/103223/Deputy-Chief-Minister-welcomes-growing-understanding-of-Guernsey-at-the-Lib-Dem-Conference|publisher=States of Guernsey|accessdate=4 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chief Minister of Guernsey, accompanied by the Commerce and Employment Minister, has been announced to attend the UK Conservative Party conference 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Guernsey misses Labour conference due to 'limited budget'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-guernsey-19832158|accessdate=4 October 2012|newspaper=Guernsey Evening Press|date=4 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guernsey's Deputy Chief Minister and Jersey's Assistant Chief Minister travelled to Dublin in September 2012 as a first step in a more coordinated approach to international relations. The purpose of the visit was to meet Ireland's Minister for European Affairs ahead of Ireland's assumption of the European Union presidency in 2013 for mutual discussions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Channel Island Ministers to meet with Irish Government|url=http://www.gov.gg/article/102582/Channel-Island-Ministers-to-meet-with-Irish-Government|publisher=States of Guernsey|accessdate=4 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ireland has also established bilateral relationships with Wales and Scotland. In 1999, Ireland opened consulates in Edinburgh and Cardiff, although the Cardiff consulate was closed in 2009 in order to cut costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2009/07/01/irish-to-close-consulate-in-cardiff-91466-24038216/|title=Irish to close consulate in Cardiff|date=July 1, 2009|journal=Wales Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Irish and Welsh governments are collaborating on various economic development projects through the auspices of the Ireland Wales Programme, funded by the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irelandwales.ie/about|title=Ireland Wales Programme 2007 - 2013|accessdate=May 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scotland and Ireland are also pursuing various forms of bilateral cooperation, evidenced by visits of the Irish Prime Minister to address the Scottish Parliament, and public statements by Scottish leaders calling for closer bilateral ties between Ireland and Scotland.&lt;ref name=salmond&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Speeches/Speeches/First-Minister/british-irish|title=First Minister Alex Salmond, Statement on the 10th British Irish Council Summit|accessdate=June 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1309357/Ahern-pledges-closer-links-with-Scotland.html|title=Ahern pledges closer links with Scotland|date=21 June 2001|accessdate=June 19, 2012|journal=The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the creation of devolved administrations in the UK, there are also increasing bilateral and multilateral relations between the constituent countries of the UK, covered in more detail in [[Politics in the United Kingdom]] and [[Devolution in the United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name=salmond/&gt;

===Joint projects===
Several joint projects amongst the various countries in the Isles have been undertaken, often around infrastructure and energy. For example, the governments of Ireland, Scotland, and Northern Ireland are collaborating on the [[ISLES]] project, which will facilitate the development of offshore [[renewable energy sources]], such as [[Wind power|wind]], [[Wave power|wave]] and [[Tidal power|tidal]] energy, and renewable energy trade between [[Scotland]], [[Republic of Ireland]] and [[Northern Ireland]].&lt;ref name=mcwilliams&gt;{{cite conference | url=http://www.all-energy.co.uk/userfiles/file/patrick-mcwilliams-180511.pdf| first = Patrick | last = McWilliams| title= Irish-Scottish Links on Energy Study (ISLES)| conference = All Energy 2011| publisher = [[Scottish Government]]| format = PDF| date=2011-05-18| accessdate=2011-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the auspices of the British-Irish council, Ministers from the UK, Ireland, Isle of Man and the Channel Islands have agreed to work on energy cooperation and development through what is called the All Islands Approach (AIA), facilitating closer links between the energy markets of the various countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='ALL-ISLANDS' ENERGY PLAN AGREED|author=Andrew Woodcock|date=20 June 2011|newspaper=Press Association National Newswire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Isle of Man and Ireland are also planning the development of renewable energy sources, including sharing costs for the development of a wind farm off the coast of the Isle of Man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isleofman.com/news/article.aspx?article=37014|title=Isle of Man to share wind farm cost with Ireland?|date=June 21, 2011|publisher=Isleofman.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A wider collaboration is also planned, with Jersey, Guernsey, Isle of Man, and Ireland, to leverage the strong tidal currents around the Channel Islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=British Isles deal on channel Islands Renewable Energy|date=3 August 2011|newspaper=Indiainfoline News Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An intergovernmental collaboration platform called the [[Irish Sea Region]] has also been set up, managed by the Dublin regional authority. The platform links the governments of Ireland, Isle of Man, the UK, and various local jurisdictions, in order to collaborate on planning for development of the Irish sea and bordering areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Irish Sea Region|url=http://www.dra.ie/dynamicdata/irish_sea_regions.php|accessdate=May 24, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717012150/http://www.dra.ie/dynamicdata/irish_sea_regions.php|archivedate=July 17, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, a natural gas interconnection agreement was signed between Ireland and the UK, linking Ireland with Scotland via the Isle of Man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/cm71/7132/7132.pdf|title=Agreement relating to the Transmission of Natural Gas through a Second Pipeline between the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and Ireland and through a Connection to the Isle of Man|date=September 24, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three [[General lighthouse authority|lighthouse authorities]] in the British Isles: [[Northern Lighthouse Board]] - responsible for Scotland and the Isle of Man; The [[Trinity House|Trinity House Lighthouse Service]] - responsible for England, Wales, the Channel Islands and Gibraltar; [[Commissioners of Irish Lights]] - responsible for Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. These three authorities, responsible for provision of [[Aid to navigation|navigational aids]] around the coasts of the British Isles, collaborate closely, and all draw on a single fund administered by the UK [[Department for Transport]] and funded through [[light dues]] levied on ships calling at UK and Irish ports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nlb.org.uk/StandardPageNoToc.aspx?id=858|title=Northern Lighthouse Board|accessdate=June 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this broad arrangement will continue, from 2015-16 the work of the Commissioners of Irish Lights in the Republic of Ireland will be funded entirely from domestic sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/29/british-shipping-tax-subsidies-irish-lighthouses|title=British shipping tax subsidies for Irish lighthouses to end|date=29 April 2011|accessdate=June 19, 2012|journal=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Citizenship and citizens rights===
{{See also|British nationality law|Irish nationality law|British nationality law and the Republic of Ireland}}
Historically, citizens of Ireland were [[British subjects]]. Currently, people born in Northern Ireland are deemed by UK law to be [[British nationality law|citizens of the United Kingdom]] (unless neither parent is either a British or Irish citizen). They are also, with similar exceptions, entitled to be [[Irish nationality law|citizens of Ireland]]. This dual entitlement was reaffirmed in the 1998 [[Good Friday Agreement]] between the British and Irish governments, which provides that:&lt;blockquote&gt;"...it is the birthright of all the people of Northern Ireland to identify themselves and be accepted as Irish or British, or both, as they may so choose, and accordingly [the two governments] confirm that their right to hold both British and Irish citizenship is accepted by both Governments and would not be affected by any future change in the status of Northern Ireland."&lt;/blockquote&gt; Ireland and the United Kingdom provide reciprocal recognition to each other's citizens. Irish citizens resident in the UK can vote and stand in any UK elections. United Kingdom citizens resident in Ireland can vote or stand in European and local elections, and vote in parliamentary elections, but cannot vote or stand in Presidential elections or referendums. British and Irish citizens can avail of public services such as health care and [[social welfare]] in each other's jurisdiction on an equal basis, and are entitled to the right of abode, with deportation only in the most exceptional of circumstances.

Since the [[British Nationality Act 1981]] came into effect, the Crown dependencies have been treated as part of the United Kingdom for [[British nationality law]] purposes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/sitecontent/documents/policyandlaw/nationalityinstructions/nisec2gensec/Britishoverseasterritories?view=Binary&lt;/ref&gt; However, each dependency maintains local controls over housing and employment, with special rules applying to British citizens without specified connections to that dependency (as well as to non-British citizens).

===Unionism===
{{Main article|Unionism in Ireland|Unionism in the United Kingdom}}

An important political movement in several countries in the Isles is [[British unionism]], an ideology favouring the continued union of the United Kingdom. It is most prevalent in [[Unionism in Scotland|Scotland]], [[England]], and [[Unionism in Ireland|Northern Ireland]]. [[British unionism]] has close ties to [[British nationalism]]. Another movement is [[Loyalism#Modern loyalists in Great Britain and Ireland|Loyalism]], which manifests itself as loyalism to the [[British Crown]].{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

===Nationalism===

The converse of unionism, [[nationalism]], is also an important factor for politics in the Isles. Nationalism can take the form of [[Welsh nationalism]], [[Cornish nationalism]], [[English nationalism]], [[Irish nationalism]], [[Scottish nationalism]], [[Ulster nationalism]] or independence movements in the Isle of Man or Channel Islands.&lt;ref name=jerseyindependence&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thisisjersey.com/latest/2010/01/21/ministers-must-prepare-for-jersey-independence/|title=Ministers 'must prepare for Jersey independence'|date=21 January 2010|newspaper=This is Jersey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Identity===

Identity is intertwined with politics, especially in the case of nationalism and independence movements. Details on identity formation in the British Isles can be found at [[Britishness]], [[Scottish identity]], [[Irish people#Irish Identity|Irish people]].

[[Pan-Celticism]] is also a movement which is present in several of the countries which have a Celtic heritage.

===Political parties===

There are no major political parties that are present in all of the countries, but several Irish parties such as [[Sinn Féin]] and [[Fianna Fáil]] have won seats in both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, and both of these parties have established offices in Britain in order to raise funds and win additional supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishpost.ie/index.php/component/content/article/5-stories/199-political-parties-to-build-links-with-irish-in-britain|title=Political parties to build links with Irish in Britain|date=17 February 2012|newspaper=The Irish Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarship of identity and politics in the British Isles==

Several academic perspectives are important in the politics and relations in the British isles. Important strands of scholarship include research on identity, especially [[Britishness]] and [[Irish people#Irish Identity|Irish identity]], and studies of the major political movements, such as separatism, [[British unionism|unionism]] and [[nationalism]]. The concept of [[post-nationalism]] is also a contemporary trend in studies of history, culture and politics in the isles.

The recent trend of using an ''archipelago'' perspective in scholarship of history, politics and identity was initiated by historian [[J. G. A. Pocock]] in the 1970s. He coined the term ''Atlantic archipelago'' as a replacement for ''British Isles'', and he pressed his fellow historians to reconsider two issues linked to the future of British history. First, he urged historians of the [[British Isles]] to move away from histories of the Three Kingdoms (Scotland, Ireland, England) as separate entities,&lt;ref&gt;Pocock, ''The Discovery of Islands'', 77–93.&lt;/ref&gt; and he called for studies implementing a bringing-together or conflation of these national narratives into truly integrated enterprises. Pocock proposed the term ''Atlantic archipelago'' to avoid the contested ''British isles''. It has since become the commonplace preference of historians to treat British history in just this fashion (e.g. [[Hugh Kearney]]'s ''The British Isles: A History of Four Nations'' or [[Norman Davies]] ''The Isles: A History'').&lt;ref&gt;Pocock, "British History: a Plea for a New Subject," 22–43 (1975); "The Field Enlarged: an Introduction," 47–57; and "The Politics of the New British History," 289–300, in ''The Discovery of Islands''. See also "The Limits and Divisions of British History: in Search of the Unknown Subject," ''American Historical Review'' 87:2 (Apr. 1982), 311–36; "The New British History in Atlantic Perspective: an Antipodean Commentary," ''American Historical Review'' 104:2 (Apr. 1999), 490–500.&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent times, [[Richard Kearney]] has been an important scholar in this space, through his works for example on a Postnationalist Archipelago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kearney|first= Richard |title= Navigations: Collected Irish Essays, 1976-2006|publisher=Syracuse University Press|year=2006|isbn=9780815631262|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FGRW45lSoVIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|chapter=Chapter 1: Towards a Postnationalist Archipelago}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Kearney's work has been noted by many as important for understanding of modern Irish politics and identity, some have also argued that his approach can be applied to the archipelago as a whole: "Scholars and critics have noted the importance of Kearney's work on post-nationalism for Irish studies and politics. However, less attention has been paid to its implications for discussions and debates beyond the Irish Sea. In this context, Kearney's writings can be viewed as part of a broader intellectual landscape in which national identity, nationalism, and possibly postnationalism are at the center of political and intellectual discussions in the Isles. I say the Isles here, rather than simply Britain, because re-imagining the component parts of Britain, or more precisely the United Kingdom, entails reconfiguring the relationships in the entire archipelago."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Traversing the Imaginary: Richard Kearney and the Postmodern Challenge|series=Northwestern University studies in phenomenology &amp; existential philosophy|author1=Peter Gratton |author2=John Panteleimon Manoussakis |author3=Richard Kearney |editor1=Peter Gratton |editor2=John Panteleimon Manoussakis |publisher=Northwestern University Press|year=2007|isbn=9780810123786|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kearney's ideas and thinking were important in the lead-up to the [[Good Friday Agreement]], and he was an early proponent of what eventually became the [[British-Irish Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Traversing the Imaginary: Richard Kearney and the Postmodern Challenge|series=Northwestern University studies in phenomenology &amp; existential philosophy|author1=Peter Gratton |author2=John Panteleimon Manoussakis |author3=Richard Kearney |editor1=Peter Gratton |editor2=John Panteleimon Manoussakis |publisher=Northwestern University Press|year=2007|isbn=9780810123786|pages=61–75}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www2.bc.edu/~kearneyr/RKCV.html|title=Richard Kearney Curriculum Vitae}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Belfast Agreement and the Nation that "Always Arrives at Its Destination."|date=Winter 2002|journal=Int'l L.

The University of Exeter in the UK and the Moore Institute at the National University of Ireland, Galway started in October 2010 the Atlantic Archipelago Research Project, which purports to "take an interdisciplinary view on how Britain’s post-devolution state inflects the formation of post-split Welsh, Scottish and English identities in the context of Ireland’s own experience of partition and self-rule; Consider the significance of this island grouping to the understanding of a Europe that exists in a range of configurations; from large scale political union, to provinces, dependencies, and micro-nationalist regions (such as Cornwall), each with their contribution and presence; Reconsider relations across our island grouping in light of issues regarding the management and use of the environment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://humanities.exeter.ac.uk/english/research/projects/aarp/|title=Atlantic Archipelagos Research Project (AARP)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{About|the radio station founded in 2005|other uses|Radio Luxembourg (disambiguation){{!}}Radio Luxembourg}}

'''Radio Luxembourg''' is the name of a commercial radio station on [[Digital Radio Mondiale]] (DRM). Begun in 2005, it has broadcast in many languages in conjunction with a television service operated from the [[Grand Duchy of Luxembourg]].

==History==
{{Main|Radio Luxembourg (English)}}
Radio Luxembourg in English from 1933 to 1939 and from 1946 to 1992 was an important forerunner of modern commercial radio in the United Kingdom. It was an effective way to advertise products by circumventing [[United Kingdom|British]] broadcasting restrictions that were in place at the time. The English-language station broadcasting from the Grand Duchy closed down at the end of 1992.

===The DRM service===
In 2005 the parent RTL company stated that the AM transmissions would not resume but that a full-time English service would begin on [[Digital Radio Mondiale]] (DRM). During August of that year, the parent operating company of Radio Luxembourg conducted digital test broadcasts to Great Britain on 7145&amp;nbsp;kHz using DRM. This culminated in the soft re-launch of Radio Luxembourg in English at 07:00 BST on September 12, 2005.

For a time Radio Luxembourg was heard at 7295&amp;nbsp;kHz DRM, but RTL has now discontinued DRM broadcasts on 7295&amp;nbsp;kHz throwing the future of the DRM station into doubt, although local DRM broadcasts are still on air in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.

Radio Luxembourg can also be heard with a live stream with a [[classic rock]] playlist. Its presenters include Lisa V, Benny Brown and [[Enda Caldwell]].

Radio Luxembourg was hoping to broadcast in English on one of the two new digital national DAB services in the UK during 2008, if [[National Grid Wireless Limited]] won the licence. However, National Grid Wireless failed to win the license, so the long-term future of English transmissions must now be in serious doubt. The station continues as an online service for the moment, although the service has not been updated with any new audio programming since 31 December 2007.

'''Volcxken Diericx''' (c. 1525 – 1600) was a Flemish printmaker and publisher.

==Biography==
[[File:The Exchange (beurs) of Antwerp.jpg|thumb|The "New Exchange" of Antwerp around 1612]]
She was probably from [[Antwerp]] like her husband [[Hieronymus Cock]] and about the same age when she married him on 29 January 1547.&lt;ref name=Cock&gt;[https://rkd.nl/explore/artists/17404 Hieronymus Cock] in the [[RKD]]&lt;/ref&gt; Together they founded the publishing business ''Aux Quatre Vents'' (The Four Winds), for which they received a patent on 11 January 1548.&lt;ref name=Cock/&gt; Their shop was located near the ''New Exchange'', on the corner of Lange Nieuwstraat and Katelijnevest. They later moved near to the tapestry exchange called ''[[Bourla Theatre|Tapissierspand]]''.

From 1551 until Cock's death, the couple employed the engravers [[Pieter Breugel the Elder]], [[Lucas van Deutecum|Lucas]] and [[Joannes van Deutecum]], [[Giorgio Ghisi]], [[Cornelis Cort]], [[Philips Galle]], [[Maarten van Heemskerck]], [[Lambert Lombard]], [[Hans Vredeman de Vries]], [[Michiel Coxcie]] and [[Frans Floris]].&lt;ref name=Lugt&gt;[http://www.fondationcustodia.fr/english/actueel/Press_release%20IN_%20Hieronymus_Cock_Sept-Dec_2013_ENG.pdf Fondation Custodia]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Deutecum&gt;[https://rkd.nl/nl/explore/artists/23488 Joannes van Deutecum (I)] in the RKD&lt;/ref&gt; 

On a print by Johannes van Deutecum from 1560, the couple is portrayed in their shop (the rest of the building and street is from an architectural fantasy by Hans Vredeman de Vries).  The print has two inscriptions, "|||| vens" and a pun "''Laet de Cock coken om tvolckx wille''" which can mean that Cock cooks or makes what folks want or that he makes what his wife (Volckx) wants:

'''Xwejni Redoubt''' ({{lang-mt|Ridott tax-Xwejni}}) was a [[redoubt]] in Xwejni Bay, limits of [[Żebbuġ, Gozo|Żebbuġ]], [[Gozo]], [[Malta]]. It was built by the [[Knights Hospitaller|Order of Saint John]] between 1715 and 1716 as one of a series of coastal fortifications around the coasts of the Maltese Islands.

The redoubt formed part of a chain of fortifications built to defend [[Marsalforn Bay|Marsalforn]] and nearby bays from Ottoman or Barbary attacks. Although the area was fortified by a number of [[Marsalforn Tower|towers]], batteries, redoubts and entrenchments, all of these have been destroyed except for [[Qolla l-Bajda Battery]] between [[Qbajjar]] and [[Xwejni Bay]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bezzina|first1=Joseph|title=Marsalforn Culture &amp; History|url=http://www.zebbuggozo.com/history-marsalforn.php|website=Żebbuġ Local Council|accessdate=7 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Xwejni Redoubt was unusual in the sense that it had a semicircular or rectangular platform, while most redoubts were pentagonal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Spiteri|first1=Stephen C.|title=18th Century Hospitaller Coastal Batteries|url=http://www.militaryarchitecture.com/index.php/Fortifications/18th-century-hospitaller-coastal-batteries.html|website=MilitaryArchitecture.com|accessdate=7 August 2015|date=10 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No remains of the redoubt have survived.&lt;ref&gt;{{mt icon}} {{cite journal|last1=Camilleri|first1=Alex|title=It-Toponomastika t'Għawdex: Ix-Xtut taż-Żebbuġ, l-Għasri, u l-Għarb|journal=L-Imnara|date=2009|volume=9|issue=2|page=73|url=http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/L-Imnara/L-Imnara.%2009(2009)2=33/09s.pdf|accessdate=7 August 2015|publisher=Għaqda tal-Folklor}}&lt;/ref&gt;
