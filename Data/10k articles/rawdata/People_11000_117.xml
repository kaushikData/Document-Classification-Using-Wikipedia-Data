'''''A Day at the Beach''''' is a British 1970 film based on the 1962 book ''Een dagje naar het strand'' by Dutch author [[Simon Heere Heeresma|Heere Heeresma]].  The screenplay was written by [[Roman Polanski]], who was originally intended to be the director, although most of the direction was finally done by first-timer [[Simon Hesera]].

==Plot==
Set in a rundown Danish seaside resort, it depicts a day in the life of Bernie, a self-destructive alcoholic, as he takes Winnie, a young girl with a leg brace, to the resort despite constant rain.  Though Winnie calls Bernie "uncle," he is likely her biological father.  Over the course of the day, they encounter various people whom Bernie alternately berates and scams for alcohol, while Winnie is often left alone to fend for herself.

==Release==
The film was never released in theatres at the time of its completion, but has seen limited runs at film festivals since then. A small clip of the film appears in the documentary ''[[The Unknown Peter Sellers]]''.

The film is available on DVD in the U.S from Code Red DVD.

'''Alice Model''' (1856–1943) was a leader of the [[Union of Jewish Women]]. She founded and supported organisations promoting family welfare and other philanthropic causes.

==Personal life==
Alice Isabella Model née Sichel was born on 13 November 1856, the daughter  of Henriette Goldschmidt and Gustavus Sichel, and grew up in a middle-class family that resided in [[Hampstead]], [[London]].&lt;ref name=odnb&gt;[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/55200 Susan L. Tananbaum, ‘Model , Alice Isabella (1856–1943)’, ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; Like a growing number of women of her time, Model expanded the acceptable horizons for women through her involvement in charitable activities. Married to Louis Model at twenty-four and childless, she devoted her life to social work and initiated many social services for women and children.&lt;ref&gt;http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/britain-nineteenth-and-twentieth-centuries&lt;/ref&gt;

== Maternal welfare ==
She sat on the Child and Maternity Committee for Stepney and represented [[Stepney]] in the London Federation of Infant Welfare Centres.&lt;ref name =tan&gt;Tananbaum, Susan ''Jewish Immigrants In London 1880-1939''. (Routledge)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1895 she founded the Sick Room Helps Society, which evolved into the Jewish Maternity Hospital in Underwood Street in 1911. The organisation aimed to help sick, poor and confined women within their homes in the East End. The organisation was the first of its kind in the United Kingdom, providing home helps and maternity nurses - one of the most important contributions to maternal healthcare.&lt;ref name="jewisheastend.com"&gt;http://www.jewisheastend.com/heroines.html&lt;/ref&gt; It provided a model for many state and private agencies which followed suit.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

[[Alma Cogan]], [[Lionel Bart]] and [[Arnold Wesker]] were born in the Jewish Maternity Hospital.  It closed its doors in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;http://spitalfieldslife.com/2011/10/17/tom-ridge-the-jewish-maternity-hospital/&lt;/ref&gt; Despite a campaign to try and save it, in 2012 the hospital was demolished by the [[Peabody Trust]], who have used the land to build flats.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eastlondonadvertiser.co.uk/news/education/go_ahead_given_for_demolition_of_east_end_s_last_jewish_hospital_1_1110139 Demolition of Jewish Hospital]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nursery ==

Model was also a key player in the formation of a nursery on Shepherd Street in Spitalfields, which initially prioritised the children of widows, so they could work and would not be completely dependent on charity.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; The nursery is cited as eliminating illnesses rife in the East End by providing children with regular meals, places to wash and disinfecting their clothes. Daily visits from doctors also prevented illnesses reaching epidemic proportions. By 1911 annual attendance by children reached 11342. [[Louisa de Rothschild|Lady Louisa Rothschild]] was president of the nursery.&lt;ref name =tan/&gt; The nursery was renamed the Alice Model Nursery School to honour Model's 80th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;''Jewish Chronicle'', 13 Nov. 1936, p23&lt;/ref&gt; The Alice Model Nursery School still exists in Stepney today.&lt;ref&gt;http://alicemodel.weebly.com/contact-us.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other causes ==
Model recruited volunteers for good causes through the Union of Jewish Women and trained them to support poorer women who shared their religion.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; She always emphasised self-reliance and disapproved of charity that seemed to undermine individual responsibility.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

She served on a London committee for dealing with the new National Health Insurance Act (1912), and on a committee administering the National Relief Fund in World War One where she was a [[Jewish Board of Guardians (United Kingdom)|Jewish Board of Guardians]] representative. In 1933, when she was already in her seventies, she joined the Jewish Refugees Committee and helped with refugees’ housing needs.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

== Honours ==
On her 70th birthday she was presented with an illuminated album inscribed with the names of 22 societies and 367 people who had been associated with her. She was appointed an [[MBE]] in the 1935 New Year’s Honours list.&lt;ref name="jewisheastend.com"/&gt; The following year, the Alice Model Nursery School was named in her honour. (See above.)

'''Alice Orlowski''' (September 30, 1903 – 1976)&lt;ref&gt;Info. pertaining to the birthplace, birthdate and camp service of Alice Orlowski was found in Daniel Patrick Brown, "THE CAMP WOMEN - The Female Auxiliaries Who Assisted the SS in Running the Nazi Concentration Camp System" p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; was a German concentration camp guard at several of the [[Nazi German]] [[German camps in occupied Poland during World War II|camps in occupied Poland]] during [[World War II]].

==Wartime==
Born as '''Alice Minna Elisabeth Elling''' in [[Berlin]] in 1903, she began her guard training at the [[Ravensbrück concentration camp]] in Germany in 1941. In October 1942 she was selected as one of the [[SS]] ''[[Aufseherin]]'' to be posted at the [[Majdanek]] camp near [[Lublin]], [[Poland]] where she, and [[Hermine Braunsteiner]], came to be regarded as two of the most brutal overseers. They regularly loaded trucks of women destined for the gas chambers. When a child was left over, the two would throw him or her on the top of the adults like luggage, and bolt the door shut. Orlowski often awaited the arrivals of new transports of women. She would then whip the prisoners, especially across the eyes. In Majdanek, Orlowski was promoted to the rank of ''Kommandoführerin'' (Work Detail Overseer) in the sorting sheds.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

As the SS Aufseherin, Orlowski had over 100 women under her supervision, who sorted through stolen items from gassed prisoners: watches, furs, coats, gold, jewellery, money, toys, glasses, etc.  When the camp was evacuated, the Germans sent Orlowski to the notorious [[Kraków-Płaszów concentration camp]] near [[Kraków]], in Nazi-occupied Poland.&lt;ref&gt;The facts pertaining to Orlowski's crimes in Majdanek are detailed by [[Simon Wiesenthal]] in ''Justice Not Vengeance.''&lt;/ref&gt;  In Plaszow-Kraków, Alice was in charge of a work detail on the Camp Street (Lager Strasse) and was known for her viciousness.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

In early January 1945, Orlowski was one of the SS women posted on the death march to [[Auschwitz-Birkenau]] and it was during this time that her behaviour, previously noted as being brutal and [[Sadism and Masochism|sadistic]], became more humane. On the death march in mid-January 1945 from Auschwitz to [[Loslau]], Orlowski gave comfort to the inmates, and even slept alongside them on the ground outside. She also brought water to those who were thirsty.&lt;ref&gt;The facts about her behavior on the death march come from Malvina Graf: ''I survived the Kraków Ghetto and Plaszow Camp''&lt;/ref&gt;  It is unknown why her attitude changed, but some speculate that she sensed the war was almost over and she would soon be tried as a [[war crime|war criminal]]. Orlowski eventually ended up back at Ravensbrück as a guard.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

==Post-war==
After the war ended in May 1945, Orlowski was captured by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] forces and [[extradition|extradited]] to Poland to stand trial for war crimes. The "picture book SS woman" stood accused at the [[Auschwitz Trial]] in 1947. She was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]], but was released in 1957 after serving only 10 years. In 1975, [[West Germany]] tracked Orlowski down, and placed her on trial in the Third [[Majdanek Trials|Majdanek Trial]].

She died during the trial in 1976 at the age of 73.

[[File:ArlenSiuFSLN.jpg|thumb|A group of Nicaraguans holding and marching with a picture of Arlen Siu and the FSLN flag in [[Jinotepe]] 3 years after her death]]
'''Arlen Siu Bermúdez''' (15 July 1955 – 1 August 1975) was a [[Chinese Nicaraguan]] woman who became one of the first female [[martyr]]s of the [[Sandinista]] revolution.

==Early life==
Arlen Siu was born on 15 July 1955 in [[Jinotepe]], Nicaragua. Her father, Armando Siu Lau, was born in [[Guangdong]], [[China]], and immigrated to [[Nicaragua]] in the late 1940s after serving in the Communist Revolutionary Army.&lt;ref name="Arlen"/&gt; He later married a Nicaraguan woman. Arlen Siu attended ''La Escuela Normal de Señoritas'' (Young Women's [[Normal School]]) in Jinotepe, and she later attended [[UNAN]], where she often sang with Marlene Álvarez, a member of a music group named Pancasán.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Personalidades en la Musica de Nicaragua: Pancasán hizo su historia | date= | publisher=Manfut | url =http://www.manfut.org/museos/musicanac.html | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2007-08-08 | language =Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sandinista revolution===
Siu was 18 when she joined the [[Sandinistas]].&lt;ref name="Arlen"/&gt;  She had already attained a level of national celebrity as a talented songwriter, singer, and guitarist by the time she joined the movement. She was killed August 1, 1975&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mujeresrevolucionaria.blogspot.fr/2011/09/arlen-sui.html |title=Mujeres Que Hacen La Revolución: Arlen Siu |publisher=Mujeresrevolucionaria.blogspot.fr |date=2011-09-28 |accessdate=2013-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; during an [[ambush]] near [[El Sauce, León|El Sauce]], [[Leon, Nicaragua|Leon]], [[Nicaragua]], by soldiers from [[Anastasio Somoza Debayle]]'s [[National Guard (Nicaragua)|National Guard]]. She was twenty years old.

She is considered by many in Nicaragua to be one of the earliest martyrs of the revolutionary movement. Her artistic works and critical essays on [[Marxism]] and [[feminism]] served as an inspiration to both the Sandinista movement and the Nicaraguan [[women's movement]].&lt;ref name="Arlen"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Roshni Rustomji-Kerns |author2=Rajini Srikanth |author3=Leny Mendoza Strobel | title = Encounters: People of Asian Descent in the Americas | publisher = [[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]] | year = 1999 | pages = 119–120 | isbn = 0-8476-9145-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Her picture was often displayed at FSLN celebrations throughout Nicaragua. [[Managua]] and [[El Rama]] have neighborhoods named after her, and a park in [[León, Nicaragua|León]] is also named after her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Parque de León sin recursos | date= | publisher= | url =http://www.laprensa.com.ni/archivo/2007/enero/05/noticias/regionales/ | work =La Prensa | pages = | accessdate = 2007-08-20 | language = Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
Siu wrote a song entitled "Maria Rural", and since her death, it has been sung by Marlene Alvarez and Grupo Pancasán, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Randall | first =Margaret | title = Todas estamos despiertas: Testimonios de la mujer Nicaragüense de hoy | publisher = Siglo XXI | year = 1980 | pages = 122–123 | isbn = 968-23-1011-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4616">[[File:Solomon Miniature Fig. 6.jpg|right|thumb|225px|King Solomon enthroned between [[grand vizier]] Asif (left) and king of jinns (right). A 16th-century ([[Safavid]]) miniature.]]

'''Asif bin Barkhiyā''' ({{lang-ar|آصف بن برخيا}}) is thought to be the [[Islamic]] scriptural figure who brought [[Queen of Sheba]]'s throne to [[King Solomon]] "...in the twinkling of an eye". Credited with the role of court [[vizier]],&lt;ref name="Arabian"&gt;Richard F. Burton, ''Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night: vol. I'', Kissinger Publishing Co, 2003, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S Bağci, ''Muqarnas'', 1995&lt;/ref&gt; it is a story occasionally recounted in [[middle-eastern]] lore,&lt;ref&gt;"Sulaymān b. Dāwūd". Encyclopædia of Islam. "Later legendary lore has magnified all this material..."&lt;/ref&gt; but perhaps more so in [[occult]] circles. The figure himself is largely unexpounded, as very few references to him are found in classical texts other than through subtle terms in [[An-Naml|Chapter 27]] of the [[Qur'an]]. He is, however, apparent in a number of books that deal with Islamic occultism or ''[[Simiyya|Ruhaniyya]]'', and in one that appears to be attributed directly to him (titled, ''al-Ajnas''). In like manner, through the ages he was eminently revered by the [[Tafsir|Quranic exegetical]] traditions where the powers he possessed were associated to the [[Names of God in Islam|Ineffable Name of Allah]].&lt;ref name = "Arabian" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Lassner, ''Demonizing the Queen of Sheba: Boundaries of Gender and Culture in Postbiblical Judaism and Medieval Islam'', University of Chicago Press, 1993, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;

==Narration==
The Qur'anic narrative is as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
He said, 'O Council, which one of you will bring me her throne, before they come to me in surrender?' {{Cite quran|27|38}}
An [[Ifrit]] of the jinns said, 'I will bring it to thee, before thou risest from thy place; I have strength for it {{Cite quran|27|39}}
and I am trusty.' Said he who possessed knowledge of the Book, 'I will bring it to thee, before ever thy glance returns to thee.' Then, when he saw it settled before him, he said, 'This is of my Lord's bounty that He may try me, whether I am thankful or ungrateful. Whosoever gives thanks gives thanks only for his own soul's good, and whosoever is ungrateful -- my Lord is surely All-sufficient, All-generous.' {{Cite quran|27|40}}
He said, 'Disguise her throne for her, and we shall behold whether she is guided or if she is of those that are not guided.' {{Cite quran|27|41}}
So, when she came, it was said, 'Is thy throne like this?' She said, 'It seems the same.' 'And we were given the knowledge before her, and we were in surrender, {{Cite quran|27|42}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Commentary==
[[Ibn Kathir]]'s dissertation in ''[[Tafsir ibn Kathir]]'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theholybook.org/content/view/8145/2/ |title=How the Throne of Bilqis was brought in an Instant  |publisher=theholybook.org |accessdate=January 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;(One with whom was knowledge of the Scripture said: ) Ibn `Abbas said, "This was Asif, the scribe of Sulayman." It was also narrated by Muhammad bin Ishaq from Yazid bin Ruman that he was Asif bin Barkhiya' and he was a truthful believer who knew the Greatest Name of Allah. Qatadah said: "He was a believer among the humans, and his name was Asif." (I will bring it to you within the twinkling of an eye!) Meaning, lift your gaze and look as far as you can, and before you get tired and blink, you will find it before you. Then he got up, performed ablution and prayed to Allah, may He be exalted. Mujahid said: "He said, O Owner of majesty and honor." When Sulayman and his chiefs saw it before them...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In [[Kitab al-Kafi]], Imam [[Hasan al-Askari]] narrates that the greatest name of Allah has seventy three letters and Asif only knew one. With that letter, the land between him and the throne of the [[Queen of Sheeba]] shrunk such that he was able to place the throne before [[Sulayman]] and the land returned to its original state before the blinking of an eye. He then further states that the Imams of [[Ahl al-Bayt]] know seventy two of the letters and the final letter is kept exclusively with Allah as knowledge of the [[ghaib]]. &lt;ref name="Kulayni"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Al-Kulayni |first1=Abu Ja’far Muhammad ibn Ya’qub |title=Kitab al-Kafi |date=2015 |publisher=The Islamic Seminary Inc. |location=South Huntington, NY |isbn=9780991430864 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

But she has an unusual kind of beauty (Anglo-Irish, Latina) that the camera loves to explore, and when she does make the hyperspace jump to sincerity and initiative, the results are compelling.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[2014 Sundance Film Festival]] in January 2014, Plaza's film, ''[[Life After Beth]]'', which was written and directed by her boyfriend Jeff Baena, premiered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inthemixxshow.com/4143/youll-never-guess-aubrey-plazas-kinky-on-set-ritual|title=You'll Never Guess Aubrey Plaza's Kinky On-Set Ritual!|publisher=In the Mixx|date=October 17, 2013|accessdate=June 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Balinese name''' is part of a system of identification used by the [[Balinese people]] and in the western parts of the neighboring island of [[Lombok]], [[Indonesia]]. A Balinese name will have three parts: a title, a birth order name and a personal name.&lt;ref&gt;Geertz H. [https://books.google.com.au/books?id=-PxGieeV6boC&amp;pg=RA1-PR9&amp;dq=balinese+name&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi9ufn3iejVAhVRO7wKHdxaB5UQ6AEIMDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=balinese%20name&amp;f=false ''Images of Power: Balinese Paintings Made for Gregory Bateson and Margaret Mead''] University of Hawaii Press, 1994 p. ix. {{ISBN|082481679X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Balinese people do not use a family name.

Both boys and girls receive [[birth order|birth order name]] from a small typical group of names for each birth order position. These names may vary due to [[caste]], regional customs and variations in the Balinese language between the north and the south of the island. Balinese people use the birth order name to refer to one another.

As most Balinese are [[Hinduism in Indonesia|Hindus]], many names will be of [[Sanskrit]] origin. Some people have traditional Balinese names. 

==Birth order name==
A birth order name is chosen from a few typical names according to the position of the child in the birth order of siblings. The people of Bali use the birth order name to refer to one another. 

The first born are named ''Wayan'', ''Putu'', ''Gede'' or for a girl, ''Ni Luh''. ''Wayan'' is a Balinese name meaning "eldest".

Second born children are named ''Made'', ''Kadek'', or ''Nengah''. ''Made'' and ''Nengah'' mean ''madya'' or "middle". ''Kadek'' means "little brother" or "little sister".

The third born is given the name ''Nyoman'' or ''Komang''. These names may be shortened to "Man" and "Mang" respectively.

Fourth born children are named ''Ketut''. Ketut is often shortened to "Tut".

If there is a fifth child in the family, she is often called ''Wayan Balik'' (meaning "Wayan again").&lt;ref&gt;Zajonc, R. B. (2001). ''The family dynamics of intellectual development''. American Psychologist 56: 490–496, p. 490.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Names according to caste==
The naming system allows a person to recognise another's caste. A person's caste, unlike in [[India]], is relatively unimportant to the Balinese people. The idea of caste flowed into Balinese culture as close links with Hindu-Buddhist Java evolved. The inclusion of the caste may also have been due to [[Airlangga]] (991 {{ndash}} 1049), a half Balinese [[raja]] of the [[Kediri Kingdom]].

The naming system of the peasant farmers of Bali may have preceded the idea of the caste. The farmers included indigenous Balinese and very early Hindu-Buddhist missionaries and their followers. The farmers represented a caste level that in India, would be called ''Sudra''. This "farmer caste" also used birth order names, perhaps to indicate inheritance.

===Sudra===
Beyond the birth order name, there are no special names to denote people from the [[Shudra|Sudra]] caste. Those of the Sudra caste add an "I" (male) and "Ni" (female) in front of their names. For example, [[I Made Mangku Pastika]], is the governor of Bali.

===Wesya===
The [[Vaishya|Wesya]] is the trader and farmer caste. The Wesya once added "Ngakan", "Kompyang", "Sang", or "Si" before their name. However, most no longer do so due to assimilation into the Sudra. An example is Ngakan Gede Sugiarta Garjitha, a major general.

===Ksatria===
The Ksatria caste are the ruling and military elite in Hindu society. Some typical names of people of the [[Kshatriya|Ksatria]] caste include: ''I Gusti Ngurah'' (male), ''I Gusti Ayu'' (female), ''Anak Agung'' (male), ''Anak Agung Ayu'' or ''Anak Agung Istri'' (female), ''Tjokorda'' which is sometimes abbreviated as ''Tjok'' (male), ''Tjokorda Istri'' (female), ''Ida I Dewa'', ''Dewa Agung'' or ''I Dewa'' (male), and ''I Dewa Ayu'', and ''Desak'' (female).

The name ''Gusti'' literally means "leader" as members of the Ksatria were often families promoted from the farmer caste. The Ksatria often use birth order names. Sometimes the Kastria borrow the whole order of the farmer caste names, so it is possible to find a name like ''I Gusti Ketut Rajendra'', indicating a male of the Wesya caste, fourth born, whose personal name is ''Rajendra''.

The word ''Agung'' means "great", or "prominent". The word ''Tjokorda'' is a conjunction of the Sanskrit words ''Tjoka'' and ''Dewa''. It literally means "the foot of the Gods", and is awarded to the highest members of the aristocracy. 

Another typical name might be ''Anak Agung Rai'', meaning a Ksatria, whose personal name means "the great one". It is more difficult to differentiate sexes by name alone among the Ksatria people, though personal names often tell, like ''Putra'', or "prince", for a boy, and ''Putri'', or "princess", for a girl.

An example is [[Sri Aji Kresna Kepakisan]] (reign 1352 CE {{ndash}} 1380 CE}}. Other examples are [[I Gusti Ngurah Rai]], military commander and national hero, [[Ide Anak Agung Gde Agung]], former Indonesian Minister of Foreign Affairs, [[Tjokorda Gde Raka Soekawati]], president of the [[State of East Indonesia]], [[Dewa Made Beratha]], a former [[List of Governors of Bali|Governor of Bali]].

===Brahmana===
The Brahmin caste are academics, intellectuals, economists, aristocrats and lawyers. Names for the [[Brahmin|Brahmana]] caste include ''Ida Bagus'' (male), ''Ida Ayu'' (female). A typical name might be ''Ida Ayu Ngurah'', meaning "Brahman woman, Beautiful highness whose personal name is Ngurah," (in English, "gift from heaven"). Other examples are [[Oka Rusmini|Ida Ayu Oka Rusmini]], novelist and [[Ida Bagus Oka]], a former governor of Bali.

Inter-caste marriages occur. Those who marry someone from a higher caste will adopt the name ''Jero'' ("come in") in front of their name.

==Gender==
A name may have a prefix to indicate gender, ''I'' for males and ''Ni'' for females. Typical names are. for example, ''I Wayan Pedjeng'' (first-born male whose personal name is "moon") or ''Ni Ketut Sulastri'' (fourth-born female whose personal name is "fine light"). Unlike Javanese names, Balinese names of Sanskrit origin do not experience vowel change from ''a'' to ''o'' (as in Javanese ''Susilo'', from ''Susila'').

'''Barbara Fitzgerald''' (16 December 1911 – 21 May 1982) was an [[Irish people|Irish]] [[novelist]].&lt;ref name="Allen"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Allen|first1=Nicholas|editor1-last=McGuire |editor1-first=James |editor2-last=Quinn |editor2-first=James |title=Dictionary of Irish Biography |date=2009 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |chapter=Fitzgerald, Barbara (Barbara Fitzgerald Somerville)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Barbara Fitzgerald was born Barbara Gregg in [[Cork (city)|Cork]] on 16 December 1911. Her parents were [[John Gregg (Archbishop of Armagh)|John Allen Fitzgerald Gregg]] and Anna Gregg (née Jennings). Fitzgerald spent her youth in [[Kilkenny]] and [[Dublin]], attending school in England. She entered [[Trinity College Dublin]] as a foundation scholar in 1931. In 1933 she graduated with honours in Italian and French. She married Michael Fitzgerald Somerville on 21 August 1935 at [[St Bartholomew's Church, Dublin]]. As a society wedding, people lined the streets of [[Ballsbridge]] to watch the wedding party pass. Fitzgerald's father performed the wedding ceremony, with the couple then honeymooning in Scotland. Her husband was an oil executive, and the couple lived in west Africa until the beginning of [[World War II]] when they returned to England. Her father-in-law was [[Henry Boyle Townshend Somerville]], who was murdered on 14 March 1936 by the IRA.&lt;ref name="Allen" /&gt;

'''Belkacem Radjef''' (1909–1989) was born in Fort-National (today [[Larbaâ Nath Irathen]], [[Tizi Ouzou Province]]), [[Algeria]] and spent 32 years of his life in the fight for the independence Algeria from [[French colonialism]].  He joined the first movement for independence, [[:fr:Étoile nord-africaine|L'Etoile Nord Africaine]], in 1930.  He became its Treasurer in 1933 and was one of its president's, [[Messali Hadj]], two principal lieutenants and advisors during the 1930s.

He was voted onto the thirty member central committee of the [[Etoile Nord-Africaine]] (ENA) and remained in this position through both subsequent renaming of the organization: the [[Parti du Peuple Algerien]] in 1937 and the [[Mouvement pour le Triomphe des Libertés Démocratiques]] in 1946.  The start of the [[Algerian War of Independence]] on November 1, 1954 marked the merger of the military, religious, and political independence associations into the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|Front de Libération nationale]] (FLN).  Radjef became a permanent member of this organization's central committee in 1956 and remained so until the Algerian Independence in 1962.

He then joined the new Algerian government as a special attaché to the Minister of Labor and Social Affairs (Bachir Boumaza).  At the same time he founded Le Secours National Algerien, whose mission was to feed, lodge, and educate the neglected shoe-shining youth of the colonial era.  Radjef retired in 1978.

'''Personal Life''':
Radjef had three children with his French wife, Reine Bulot: Tarek, Yamina, and Patrick (né Amar).

'''J. William "Little Bill" Standifer''' (1853 - October 4, 1903) was an American [[gunfighter|gunman]] and [[police officer|lawman]] of the [[Old West]]. He is best remembered for having been killed by noted and better known gunman [[John Higgins (gunman)|John Higgins]] in 1903.

==Early life and notoriety==
Standifer was born J. William "Bill" Standifer in [[Burnet County, Texas]], and raised in [[Lampasas County, Texas]], working cattle. By the age of 14, he was working regularly as a [[cowboy]]. That year, when he came across four men [[cattle rustling|rustling cattle]], he was pistol whipped by the men and badly hurt, but survived. Despite his youth, he tracked all four men, and killed them one by one. Although charges were pursued, he was [[acquitted]]. 

In April 1879, Standifer was working as a cowboy on the ''Ike Mullins Ranch'', in [[Tom Green County, Texas]], where he came into contact with another cowboy, John McMahon, sometimes called John Mahon. The two found themselves involved in an argument when Standifer refused to allow McMahon to drive cattle across a [[pasture]] where Standifer was holding several head of Mullin's cattle. McMahon produced a [[bullwhip]], while a companion pointed a rifle at Standifer, then McMahon began whipping Standifer. Both men were mounted, and Standifer was able to ride away to escape. Days later, Standifer tracked McMahon to a cattle camp near Pony Creek, located in [[Coleman County, Texas|Coleman County]]. As Standifer rode up, McMahon was mounted talking with several other cowboys. Upon seeing Standifer, McMahon drew his pistol and fired, but missed. Standifer drew and fired also, hitting McMahon in the wrist, causing his pistol to fall from his grip. McMahon spun his horse and galloped away, with Standifer in pursuit. The two made it about 600 yards from where the shootout began, with Standifer shooting McMahon again in the back, knocking him from his saddle. McMahon scrambled to his feet and attempted to run, but was again shot in the back, killing him. 

Standifer fled, making it to [[Marfa, Texas]], where he became involved in a [[Western saloon|saloon]] argument with three soldiers from [[Fort Davis, Texas|Fort Davis]], during which he shot and wounded two of them, before fleeing. Members of the [[Texas Rangers Division|Texas Rangers]] hunted Standifer down for the McMahon killing, and arrested him. However he was acquitted in a [[trial]]. Those shootings led to Standifer becoming known as a "gunman", and helped him in gaining employment as a Range Detective.

==Lawman career, feud with John Higgins==

By the early 1880s, Standifer was working as a Range Detective, tracking down rustlers, and is known to have shot and killed at least one rustler near Estacado, Texas. When the demand for his services dwindled, Standifer ran and was elected as County Sheriff for [[Crosby County, Texas]] from 1888 through 1894. While serving as Sheriff, in 1891, he and Deputy Charlie Quillen pursued a group of [[Post Office]] thieves into [[Lincoln County, New Mexico]], where they captured them. 

On the return trip to Texas, while staying over at the ''VVN Ranch'' owned by George Neal, the [[outlaw]]s attempted to overpower him and Deputy Quillen. The deputy was shot and wounded in the chest with his own rifle, but was able to wrestle the outlaw to the floor and overpower him. The shot had also wounded George Neal's wife. Standifer, who was outside tending the horses, heard the wife scream, and ran inside. Another of the outlaws had acquired Standifer's [[shotgun]], but when Standifer entered, the shotgun misfired. Standifer beat the suspect into submission, then assisted Deputy Quillen. That same night he shackled all three outlaws, and rode with them and Quillen to the nearest doctor. Deputy Quillen survived, and the two were later able to take their prisoners on to Texas. 

In 1893 he began working again as a Range Detective for large and prosperous [[ranch]]es in the [[Texas Panhandle]], mainly the powerful ''Spur Ranch'', located in [[Spur, Texas]], where he first met John "Pink" Higgins, a notable gunman already known to Standifer, since they were both from [[Lampasas, Texas]]. Standifer quickly gained a reputation for being an excellent tracker, and for always locating his prey. In June 1898, while tracking rustlers, Standifer arrived in [[Clairemont, Texas]], a rough town at the time, and the location in which Jeff Hardin, brother to gunman [[John Wesley Hardin]], had been shot and killed. Standifer located a rustler named Bob Kiggins there, but Kiggins refused to surrender, and in the gunfight that followed Standifer shot and killed Kiggins. 

During this period, an animosity between Standifer and Higgins developed, one that has never truly been explained. It has been written that the [[Horrell Brothers]], who were brought down mostly through the efforts of "Pink" Higgins, and who were distant kin to Standifer, was part of their problems. However, it is more likely that it was due to Higgins' son, Cullin, an [[Lawyer|attorney]], who had only recently represented Standifer's wife in her divorce from Standifer. Fred Horsbrugh, manager of the ''Spur Ranch'', fired both Higgins and Standifer due to the increasing hostilities between them. However, Horsbrugh allowed Higgins to stay on for a time after this, until he could find another job. This angered Standifer. In 1900, Standifer moved to [[Hartley County, Texas]], where he was elected Sheriff. 

At one point, just prior to Higgins leaving the ''Spur Ranch'', he was dispatched to investigate a possible cattle rustling on a remote section of the ranch. Making a circular approach, Higgins spotted Standifer waiting in a group of trees. Rather than approach him, and knowing he was there to [[ambush]] him, Higgins simply went home. However, the animosity continued. On the morning of October 4, 1903, after having made comments that he would kill Higgins, Standifer rode out to Higgins' ranch. Higgins, seeing him from his house, rode out to meet him. Higgins' brother-in-law and daughter were standing on a hillside nearby, and witnessed what happened next. Standifer fired first, hitting Higgins' horse, which then jerked, causing Higgins first shot to go wild. In the shooting exchange that followed, Standifer was shot and killed. Higgins' horse also died. 

Higgins then retrieved another horse, and contacted Sheriff B. F. Roy, in Clairemont. When Higgins told Sheriff Roy that he believed he had killed Standifer, Sheriff Roy, who disliked Standifer for reasons unknown, stated "Well if you're not sure, you'd better go and finish the job". The shooting was ruled [[justifiable homicide]], and Higgins was never arrested or tried. He buried Standifer himself, on the Higgins property, naming the thicket where he is buried "Standifer's Thicket".

'''Catharine Alice MacKinnon''' (born October 7, 1946) is an American [[Radical feminism|radical feminist]] legal scholar. She is the Elizabeth A. Long Professor of Law at the [[University of Michigan Law School]], where she has been tenured since 1990, and the James Barr Ames Visiting Professor of Law at [[Harvard Law School]]. From 2008 to 2012 she was the special gender adviser to the [[Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court]].&lt;ref name=Harvardbio&gt;{{cite web |title=Catharine A.

As an expert on international law, constitutional law, political and legal theory, and jurisprudence, MacKinnon focuses on women's rights and sexual abuse and exploitation, including [[sexual harassment]], [[rape]], [[prostitution]], [[sex trafficking]] and [[pornography]]. She was among the first to argue that pornography is a civil rights violation, and that sexual harassment in education and employment constitutes sex discrimination.&lt;ref name=Harvardbio/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Also see {{cite news |last1=MacKinnon |first1=Catharine A. |title=#MeToo Has Done What the Law Could Not |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/04/opinion/metoo-law-legal-system.html |work=The New York Times |date=February 4, 2018 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20180205122930/https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/04/opinion/metoo-law-legal-system.html |archivedate=February 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
MacKinnon was born in [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]], the first of three children (a girl and two boys) to Elizabeth Valentine Davis and [[George MacKinnon|George E. MacKinnon]]; her father was a lawyer, congressman (1947–1949), and judge on the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit|U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit]] (1969–1995).&lt;ref name="Bio.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/catharine-a-mackinnon-9393211|title=Catharine A.

MacKinnon became the third generation of her family to attend her mother's alma mater, [[Smith College]], graduating in the top two percent of her class. She obtained her J.D. from [[Yale University]] in 1977 and a PhD in political science, also from Yale, in 1987. While at Yale, she received a [[National Science Foundation]] fellowship.&lt;ref name=UMBio/&gt;&lt;ref name=Harvardbio/&gt;

She has also written extensively on social and political theory and methodology.&lt;ref name="points"&gt;MacKinnon, Catherine A. (2000). "Points Against Postmodernism", 75, ''Chi.-Kent L. Rev.'', pp. 687–688.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research and legal work==
===Sexual harassment===
According to an article in 2006 by Deborah Dinner in ''[[Legal Affairs]]'', MacKinnon first focused on what became known as sexual harassment after learning about an administrative assistant at [[Cornell University]] who had resigned after being hospitalized because of it. The woman had refused a transfer when she complained about her supervisor's behavior, then was denied unemployment benefits because she quit for what were termed "personal" reasons.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

In 1977 MacKinnon graduated from [[Yale Law School]] having written a paper on sexual harassment for Professor Thomas I. Emerson arguing that it was a form of sex-based discrimination. Two years later, Yale University Press published MacKinnon's book, ''Sexual Harassment of Working Women: A Case of Sex Discrimination'' (1979), creating the legal claim for sexual harassment as a form of [[sex discrimination]] under [[Civil Rights Act of 1964#Title VII|Title&amp;nbsp;VII]] of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and any other sex-discrimination prohibition. While working on the paper and book, she shared draft copies with legal authorities who embraced her approach. She also conceived the legal claim for sexual harassment as sex discrimination in education under Title IX, which was established through litigation brought by Yale undergraduates in ''[[Alexander v. Yale]].'' While the plaintiff who went to trial on the facts, Pamela Price, lost, the case established the law: the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]] recognized that, under the civil rights statute [[Title IX]] of the [[Education Amendments of 1972]], schools must have procedures to address sexual harassment as a form of sex discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander v. Yale Univ., 631 F.2d 178, 181 n.1 (2d Cir. 1980).&lt;/ref&gt;

In her book, MacKinnon argued that sexual harassment is sex discrimination because the act is a product of, and produces, the social inequality of women to men (see, for example, pp.&amp;nbsp;116–18, 174). She distinguishes between two types of sexual harassment (see pp.&amp;nbsp;32–42): 1) "quid pro quo", meaning sexual harassment "in which sexual compliance is exchanged, or proposed to be exchanged, for an employment opportunity (p. 32)" and 2) the type of harassment that "arises when sexual harassment is a persistent condition of work (p. 32)". In 1980, the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] followed MacKinnon's framework in adopting guidelines prohibiting sexual harassment by prohibiting both quid pro quo harassment and hostile work environment harassment (see 29 [[Code of Federal Regulations|C.F.R.]] § 1604.11 (a)). Courts also used the concepts.

In 1986 the [[SCOTUS|Supreme Court]] held in ''[[Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson]]'' that sexual harassment may violate laws against sex discrimination. MacKinnon was co-counsel for Mechelle Vinson, the plaintiff, and wrote the brief in the Supreme Court. In ''Meritor'', the Court recognized the distinction between quid pro quo sexual harassment and hostile workplace harassment. In a 2002 article, MacKinnon wrote, quoting the Court:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Without question," then-Justice Rehnquist wrote for a unanimous Court, "when a supervisor sexually harasses a subordinate because of the subordinate's sex, that supervisor "discriminate&amp;#91;s&amp;#93;" on the basis of sex." The D.C. Circuit, and women, had won. A new common law rule was established.&lt;ref name="logic"&gt;Catharine A. MacKinnon, "The Logic of Experience: Reflections on the Development of Sexual Harassment Law", 90 ''Geo. L.J.'' 813, 824 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

MacKinnon's book, ''Sexual Harassment of Working Women: A Case of Sex Discrimination'', is the eighth most-cited American legal book published since 1978, according to a study published by [[Fred R. Shapiro]] in January 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=MacKinnon|first1=Catharine|title=Sexual Harassment of Working Women: A Case of Sex Discrimination|date=1979|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=9780300022995|page=1|edition=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pornography===
====Position====
{{Further|Anti-pornography movement}}
MacKinnon, along with late feminist activist [[Andrea Dworkin]], tried to change legal approaches to pornography by framing it as a civil rights violation in the form of sex discrimination, and as human trafficking. They defined pornography as:

{{quote|the graphic sexually explicit subordination of women through pictures or words that also includes women dehumanized as sexual objects, things, or commodities; enjoying pain or humiliation or rape; being tied up, cut up, mutilated, bruised, or physically hurt; in postures of sexual submission or servility or display; reduced to body parts, penetrated by objects or animals, or presented in scenarios of degradation, injury, torture; shown as filthy or inferior; bleeding, bruised, or hurt in a context that makes these conditions sexual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=MacKinnon |first1=Catherine |title=Feminism Unmodified: Discourses on Life and Law |date=1987 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge, MA|page=176|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In ''Toward a Feminist Theory of the State'', MacKinnon writes, "Pornography, in the feminist view, is a form of forced sex, a practice of sexual politics, and institution of gender inequality." As documented by extensive empirical studies, she writes, "Pornography contributes causally to attitudes and behaviors of violence and discrimination which define the treatment and status of half the population."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|title=Toward A Feminist Theory of The State|last=Mackinnon|first=Catharine|publisher=Harvard|year=1989|isbn=0674896467|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|page=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|196}}

====Anti-pornography ordinances====
{{Main|Antipornography Civil Rights Ordinance}}
In 1980, [[Linda Boreman]] (who had appeared, under the name Linda Lovelace in the pornographic film ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]'') claimed her ex-husband [[Chuck Traynor]] had violently coerced her into making Deep Throat and other pornographic films. Boreman made her charges public for the press corps at a press conference, together with MacKinnon, members of [[Women Against Pornography]], and feminist writer [[Andrea Dworkin]] offering statements in support. After the press conference, Dworkin, MacKinnon, Boreman, and [[Gloria Steinem]] began discussing the possibility of using federal civil rights law to seek damages from Traynor and the makers of ''Deep Throat''. This was not possible for Boreman because the [[statute of limitations]] for a possible suit had passed.&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite book | last = Brownmiller | first = Susan | author-link = Susan Brownmiller | title = In Our Time: Memoir of a Revolution | publisher = Dial Press | location = New York | year = 1999 | isbn = 9780385314862 |page=337}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MacKinnon and Dworkin continued to discuss civil rights litigation, specifically sex discrimination, as a possible approach to combating pornography. MacKinnon opposed traditional arguments and laws against pornography based on the idea of morality or filth or sexual innocence, including the use of traditional criminal obscenity law to suppress pornography. Instead of condemning pornography for violating "community standards" of sexual decency or modesty, they characterized pornography as a form of sex discrimination and sought to give women the right to seek damages under civil rights law when they could prove they had been harmed. Their anti-pornography ordinances make actionable only sexually explicit material that can be proven to subordinate on the basis of sex.

In 1983, the [[Minneapolis]] city government hired MacKinnon and Dworkin to draft an anti-pornography civil rights ordinance as an amendment to the Minneapolis city human rights ordinance. The amendment defined pornography as a [[civil rights]] violation against women and allowed women who claimed harm from trafficking in pornography to [[lawsuit|sue]] the producers and distributors for damages in [[Civil law (common law)|civil court]]. It also allowed those who had been coerced into pornography, had had pornography forced upon them, or were assaulted in a way caused by specific pornography to sue for harm they could prove. The law was passed twice by the Minneapolis city council but was vetoed by the mayor. Another version of the ordinance passed in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]] in 1984, but was ruled [[United States Constitution|unconstitutional]] by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit|Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals]], a decision summarily affirmed (without opinion) by the U.S. Supreme Court.

MacKinnon wrote in the ''Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Liberties Law Review'' in 1985

&lt;blockquote&gt;And as you think about the assumption of consent that follows women into pornography, look closely some time for the skinned knees, the bruises, the welts from the whippings, the scratches, the gashes. Many of them are not simulated. One relatively soft core pornography model said, "I knew the pose was right when it hurt." It certainly seems important to the audiences that the events in the pornography be real. For this reason, pornography becomes a motive for murder, as in "[[Snuff film|snuff]]" films in which someone is tortured to death to make a sex film. They exist."&lt;ref&gt;Catharine A. MacKinnon, "Pornography, Civil Rights, and Speech", 20 ''Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Liberties Law Review'' 1 (1985). For support for her claim that snuff films exist, MacKinnon wrote in footnote 61, "In the movies known as snuff films, victims sometimes are actually murdered."' 130 Cong. Rec. S13192 (daily ed. October 3, 1984; statement of Senator [[Arlen Specter]] introducing the [[Pornography Victims Compensation Act|Pornography Victims Protection Act]]). See ''People v. Douglas'', Felony Complaint No. NF 8300382 (Municipal Court, Orange County, Cal. August 5, 1983); "'Slain Teens Needed Jobs, Tried Porn"' and "Two Accused of Murder in 'Snuff' Films", ''[[Oakland Tribune]]'', August 6, 1983 (on file with ''Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Liberties Law Review''); L. Smith, The Chicken Hawks (1975)(unpublished manuscript; on file with ''Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Liberties Law Review'').&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

MacKinnon represented Boreman from 1980 until Boreman's death in 2002. Civil libertarians frequently find MacKinnon's theories objectionable (see "[[#Criticisms|Criticisms]]" section), arguing there is no evidence that sexually explicit media encourages or promotes violence against, or other measurable harm of women.&lt;ref&gt;Dworkin, Ronald. "Women and Pornography", ''[[New York Review of Books]]'' 40, no. 17 (21 October 1993): 299. "no reputable study has concluded that pornography is a significant cause of sexual crime: many of them conclude, on the contrary, that the causes of violent personality lie mainly in childhood"&lt;/ref&gt; Max Waltman states that the empirical evidence for this view is emphatic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Waltman|first=Max|date=March 2010|title=Rethinking Democracy: Legal Challenges to Pornography and Sex Inequality in Canada and the United States|url=|journal=Political Research Quarterly|volume=63|pages=218–237|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International work===
In February 1992 the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] largely accepted MacKinnon's theories of equality, hate propaganda, and pornography, citing extensively from a brief she co-authored in [[R. v. Butler|a ruling against]] [[Manitoba]] pornography distributor Donald Butler. The ''Butler'' decision was controversial to some; it is sometimes implied that shipments of Dworkin's book ''[[Pornography: Men Possessing Women]]'' were seized by Canadian customs agents under this ruling, as well as books by [[Marguerite Duras]] and [[David Leavitt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Margulis|first=Zachary|url=http://www.efc.ca/pages/wired-3.03.html|title=Canada's Thought Police|date=1995|work=Wired|publisher=Electronic Frontier Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nostatusquo.com/ACLU/dworkin/OrdinanceCanada.html|title=Canadian Customs and Legal Approaches to Pornography|accessdate=2007-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, MacKinnon's brief argued that seizure of materials for which no harm was shown was unconstitutional.

Successful ''Butler'' prosecutions have been undertaken against the [[lesbian]] [[sadomasochistic]] magazine ''Bad Attitude'', as well as the owners of a gay and lesbian bookstore for selling it. Canadian authorities raided an art gallery and confiscated controversial paintings depicting [[child abuse]]. Many free speech and gay rights activists have alleged that the law is selectively enforced, targeting the [[LGBT community]].

MacKinnon represented Bosnian and Croatian women against Serbs accused of genocide since 1992, creating the legal claim for rape as an act of genocide in that conflict. She was co-counsel, representing named plaintiff S. Kadic, in ''Kadic v. [[Radovan Karadžić|Karadzic]]'' and won a jury verdict of $745 million in New York City on August 10, 2000. The lawsuit (under the United States' [[Alien Tort Statute]]) established forced prostitution and forced impregnation when based on ethnicity or religion in a genocidal context as legally actionable acts of genocide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davies|first1=Cristyn|last2=Knox|first2=Sara L.|title=Cultural Studies of Law|date=2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-69727-5|pages=118, 126–128|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4pG9CgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA128&amp;pg=PA126|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, MacKinnon was named co-director of the Lawyers Alliance for Women (LAW) Project, an initiative of Equality Now, an international [[non-governmental organization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=Steven Harmon|title=The U.S. Justice System: Law and constitution in early America|date=2012|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-59884-304-0|pages=605–606|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Snia9Kt7rokC&amp;lpg=PA606&amp;pg=PA605|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MacKinnon proposed the law against prostitution in Sweden in 1990, which Sweden passed in 1999. What became termed the Swedish Model, also known as the Nordic Model or the Equality Model, penalizes buyers of persons for sexual use as well as sellers, namely pimps or sex traffickers, while decriminalizing all those who are bought and sold in prostitution. The fundamental concept is that the requirement to exchange sexual use for survival is a product of sex inequality and a form of violence against women. This model, shown to have reduced prostitution and sex trafficking dramatically, has been accepted in Norway, Iceland, Canada, Ireland, Northern Ireland, and France. &lt;sup&gt;(citation needed)&lt;/sup&gt; MacKinnon works actively with the Coalition Against Trafficking in Women (CATW) and Apne Aap in India.

==Political theory==
MacKinnon argues that the inequality between women and men in most societies form a hierarchy that institutionalizes male dominance, subordinating women, in an arrangement rationalized and often perceived as natural. She writes about the interrelations between theory and practice, recognizing that women's experiences have, for the most part, been ignored in both arenas. Furthermore, she uses [[Marxism]] to critique certain points in [[liberal feminism]] in [[feminist theory]] and uses [[radical feminism]] to criticize Marxist theory.{{sfn|MacKinnon|1987|pp=15–16, 60, 118–120, 136–137}} MacKinnon notes Marx's criticism of theory that treated class division as a spontaneous event that occurred naturally. She understands epistemology as theories of knowing, and politics as theories of power: "Having power means, among other things, that when someone says, 'this is how it is', it is taken as being that way.&amp;nbsp;... Powerlessness means that when you say 'this is how it is,' it is not taken as being that way. This makes articulating silence, perceiving the presence of absence, believing those who have been socially stripped of credibility, critically contextualizing what passes for simple fact, necessary to the epistemology of a politics of the powerless."&lt;ref&gt;MacKinnon, Catharine A. (1985). "Pornography, Civil Rights, and Speech", 20 ''Harv. C.R.-C.L. L. Rev.'' 1, 3 &amp; n.2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1996 [[Fred R. Shapiro]] calculated that "Feminism, Marxism, Method, and the State: Toward Feminist Jurisprudence", 8 Signs 635 (1983), was the 96th most cited article in law reviews even though it was published in a non-legal journal.&lt;ref&gt;Fred R. Shapiro, "The Most-Cited Law Review Articles Revisited," 71 ''Chi.-Kent L. Rev.'' 751 (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
During the "[[Feminist Sex Wars]]" in the 1980s, feminists opposing anti-pornography stances, such as Carole Vance and the late [[Ellen Willis]], began referring to themselves as "pro-sex" or "[[sex-positive feminists]]". Sex positive feminists and anti-pornography feminists have debated over the implicit and explicit meanings of these labels. Sex-positive feminists note that anti-pornography ordinances contrived by MacKinnon and Dworkin called for the removal, censorship, or control over sexually explicit material.&lt;ref&gt;Carole Vance. "More Pleasure, More Danger: A Decade after the Barnard Sexuality Conference", ''Pleasure and Danger: Towards a Politics of Sexuality'' (Carole Vance, ed., 1984).&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''States of Injury'' (1995), [[Wendy Brown (political theorist)|Wendy Brown]] contends that MacKinnon's attempt to ban prostitution and pornography does not primarily protect but reinscribes the category of "woman" as an essentialized identity premised on injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/5715.html|title=States of Injury book description|accessdate=June 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Nation]]'', Brown also characterized MacKinnon's ''Toward a Feminist Theory of the State'' (1989) as a "profoundly static world view and undemocratic, perhaps even anti-democratic, political sensibility" as well as "flatly dated" and "developed at 'the dawn of feminism's second wave ... framed by a political-intellectual context that no longer exists—a male Marxist monopoly on radical social discourse'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://acc.english.ucsb.edu/ACGCC%2014-15/Brown_The%20Impossibility%20of%20Women%27s%20Studies.pdf|title=The Impossibility of Women's Studies|accessdate=June 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
MacKinnon formerly had a relationship with author and animal-rights activist [[Jeffrey Masson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Dinitia|title=Love is Strange|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=61MAAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA36|work=New York Magazine|date=March 22, 1993|pages=36–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5409">The [[Organisation of African Unity]] (OAU) '''Convention Governing the Specific Aspects of Refugee Problems in Africa''', also called the '''OAU Refugee Convention''', or the '''1969 Refugee Convention''', is regional legal instrument governing [[refugee]] protection in Africa. It comprises 15 articles and was enacted in [[Addis Ababa]] on September 10, 1969 and entered into forced on June 20, 1974. It builds on the [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees|1951 Refugee Convention]] and the [[Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees|1967 Protocol]] and it has influenced the 1984 [[Cartagena Declaration]] and the 2009 [[Kampala Convention]]. The 1969 Refugee Convention's historical context is the era of [[decolonization]], [[Apartheid]], as well as internal political and military uprisings.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fmreview.org/faith/okello.html&lt;/ref&gt;

It was signed by 41 states or governments and has currently been ratified by 45 of the 54 member states of the [[African Union]]. It is the only binding, regional [[refugee law|legal instrument on refugee issues]] in the developing world and a regional complement of the 1951 Refugee Convention.&lt;ref&gt;http://lawjournal.mcgill.ca/userfiles/other/5818395-581.art.Sharpe.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal innovations==
The 1969 Refugee Convention has made some significant advances from the 1951 Refugee Convention.
* Discrimination against refugees is prohibited on the additional grounds of membership of a particular social group, nationality, or political opinion. These grounds were absent in the 1951 Refugee Convention.
* Any refugee who has “committed a serious non-political crime outside his country of refuge after his admission to that country as a refugee” or who "acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the OAU" will be excluded from the definition.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.achpr.org/instruments/refugee-convention/&lt;/ref&gt; It also contains a prohibition for refugees and asylum seekers to engage in any subversive activities against any member states.
* It contains suggestions for burden- and responsibility sharing, solidarity and cooperation between the member states, such as regional resettlement and financial support.
* It de-politicized the concept of asylum, a peaceful and humanitarian act, and declared that it shall no longer be perceived by member states as an unfriendly act and it urges the member states to grant asylum to those individuals who fall within the refugee definition. Whereas it advances here from the 1951 Refugee Convention it does still not grant an individual the right to asylum (it remains the state's discretion to grant this right).&lt;ref&gt;http://lawjournal.mcgill.ca/userfiles/other/5818395-581.art.Sharpe.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* It introduced the ''"absolute"'' prohibition of [[refoulement]], whereas the 1951 Refugee Convention allowed return or expulsion of refugees if the national security of the state would be at risk. However, if asylum seekers commit certain serious crimes, they will be excluded from the refugee definition and could still be returned or expelled. Refoulement is thus only limited but not absolutely prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;http://lawjournal.mcgill.ca/userfiles/other/5818395-581.art.Sharpe.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* The principle of [[voluntary repatriation]] was first codified. However, the situation in the country of origin to which the refugee would return, was not defined and thus a fundamental change in circumstances and human rights standards in that country is not needed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.forcedmigration.org/research-resources/expert-guides/international-law-and-legal-instruments/alternative-standards-specific-to-refugees-the&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expansion of the definition of the term refugee===

The 1969 Refugee Convention expanded the 1951 definition of who is a refugee:
* A second paragraph is added to the definition of the term "refugee", which includes "external aggression, occupation, foreign domination or events seriously disturbing public order" as reasons for flight.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.achpr.org/instruments/refugee-convention/&lt;/ref&gt; This includes accidental situations that are not based on deliberate state action, i.e. the source of danger does not need to be the state or its agents. This includes those fleeing environmental catastrophes such as drought and famine. And that means that the fear of danger is no longer only linked to the individual's personal subjective reaction but also to the causal element of refugee situations. This change in the definition has paved the way for ''"prima facie"'' group refugee status determination.
* Whereas the 1951 Refugee Convention uses "country of his nationality" as geographical unit that a refugee must have fled from, the second paragraph of the definition in the 1969 Refugee Convention uses "his place of habitual residence" as geographical frame of reference.

'''Danilo Restivo''' (born 3 April 1972) is an Italian man serving a life sentence with a 40-year [[Life imprisonment in England and Wales|tariff]] in Britain for the 12 November 2002 murder of Heather Barnett in [[Bournemouth]], England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/whole-life-term-for-hair-fetish-killer-2304783.html|title='Whole life' term for hair fetish killer|date=30 June 2011|work=The Independent (UK)|accessdate=30 June 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Investigators suspected Restivo had murdered Barnett because of his involvement in the 12 September 1993 disappearance of Elisa Claps in [[Potenza]], but they were unable to charge him because of lack of evidence.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;A Church Cover Up?, Sunday Times,19 Feb 2012, Culture magazine, p.36-37&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent to the 2010 discovery of Claps's body, Restivo was tried for the murder of Barnett, with evidence of similarities in ritualistic placing of hair on the bodies of Claps and Barnett being heard by the English court. He was found guilty of murdering Barnett,&lt;ref name=autogenerated8&gt;[http://www.cps.gov.uk/wessex/cps_wessex_news/press_release_on_found_guilty_of_murdering_heather_barnett/ Danilo Restivo found guilty of murdering Heather Barnett], Crown Prosecution Service, Wessex, 08/06/2011&lt;/ref&gt; and later convicted ''in absentia'' of the murder of Claps by an Italian court.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/danilo-restivo-guilty-of-teenager-murder-6260845.html|title=Danilo Restivo guilty of teenager murder|date=11 November 2011|work=The Independent (UK)|accessdate=17 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Restivo was born in [[Sicily]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S2yPCwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT46&amp;dq=%22danilo%20restivo%22%20%22sicily%22&amp;pg=PT46#v=onepage&amp;q=%22danilo%20restivo%22%20%22sicily%22&amp;f=false|title=Out For Blood: 18 Authentic True Crime Stories of Murder and Mayhem|last=King|first=Gary C.|date=2016-10-25|publisher=Bleak House Publishing|isbn=9781311250933|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972 he was living with his parents and his elder sister in the city of [[Potenza]], in Southern Italy. 
He would attempt to arrange dates with girls by claiming to have a present for them. Restivo harassed those who rejected him with phone calls in which he would play a soundtrack to ''[[Deep Red|Profondo Rosso]]'' (English title: ''Deep Red''), a ''[[giallo]]'' film about a serial killer who plays a melody before every murder.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HQP1A1xcZXoC&amp;lpg=PT58&amp;ots=naMNcFPCUz&amp;dq=restivo%20profondo%20rosso&amp;pg=PT58#v=onepage&amp;q=restivo%20profondo%20rosso&amp;f=false|title=Blood on the Altar|last=Jones|first=Tobias|date=2012-02-28|publisher=Faber &amp; Faber|isbn=9780571274956|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Claps, the 16-year-old daughter of a tobacconist and a clerk, was an honor student and a devoted Catholic, with ambitions to become a [[physician]] and work with [[Médecins Sans Frontières]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She was the youngest of three children and was described as very close to her family. Friends reported Claps felt sorry for Restivo, who appeared lonely and depressed. She  wrote several pages in her secret diary complaining about his odd behaviour. Despite misgivings, she agreed to meet Restivo at the 15th-century [[Chiesa della Santissima Trinità, Potenza|Chiesa della Santissima Trinità]] in the centre of the city, after Restivo phoned and asked for a date, pretending he had a love match with a friend of hers and asking for suggestions.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/jun/29/danilo-restivo-murder-conviction-iceberg Danilo Restivo's murder conviction is just the tip of the iceberg], Guardian, 29 June 2011,&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disappearance of Elisa Claps===
On Sunday 12 September 1993, Claps, accompanied by a female friend, went to meet Restivo at the church, arriving at approximately 11:30 a.m., just as mass had ended. When she did not return home, Claps' elder brother, Gildo, telephoned Restivo's family residence and was told that Restivo was out of town due to university essays and had no knowledge of Claps's whereabouts.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt; When Gildo went to the church, he discovered the priest in charge, Domenico Sabia, had suddenly left for some days, taking with him the only key giving access to the upper story of the church building.&lt;ref&gt;A Church Cover Up?, Sunday Times, 19 Feb 2012, Culture magazine, p.36-37&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1260664/Priest-knew-body-16-year-old-missing-student-church-months-discovered.html Priest 'knew' the body of 16-year-old missing student was in his church two months before it was 'discovered'], 25 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Gildo reported the disappearance of his sister to police, but was initially told the matter had "no urgency" and policemen suggested Elisa could have run away with her boyfriend or something similar.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; When a policeman questioned him, Restivo fell into a near-hysterical state, then admitted that he and Claps had spent some time together discussing the girl he had fallen in love with. Claps had then left the church, while he had stayed to pray. He added that Claps had seemed frightened and had confided to him that she "had been harassed by a boy before entering the church". Restivo explained a severe cut on his hand as the result of an accident. Later that day, he said, he had gone to [[Naples]], where he was a freshman at the Faculty of Dentistry. The Restivo family declined the policeman's request for clothes Restivo had worn on that Sunday morning. Moreover, the fiancé of Restivo's sister, a young man named Giovanni M., told the police that Restivo had looked terrified about that little cut on his hand and had insisted on being accompanied to the [[Emergency department|emergency room]]. Giovanni M. stated that Restivo's jacket looked very dirty and soaked with blood.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; Sabia opposed a search of the church.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookreviews/9086606/Blood-on-the-Altar-In-Search-of-a-Serial-Killer-by-Tobias-Jones-review.html Blood on the Altar: In Search of a Serial Killer by Tobias Jones: review] Telegraph, 20 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Restivo was known to police, who believed him be responsible for nine incidents in which women had had their hair clandestinely cut.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/jun/29/timeline-daniel-restivo-murder-trial?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487 Timeline: Danilo Restivo trial], Guardian, 29 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; He was also thought to have tied up two children before cutting one with a knife. A magistrate refused to issue an arrest warrant for Restivo in June 1994, but four months later he was taken into custody.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; An Italian policeman who questioned Restivo described him as "cunning" and "precise in his answers".&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt;

===Conspiracy-theorising and false leads===
Claps' disappearance was the subject of intense media interest and speculation.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/jun/29/how-danilo-restivo-was-caught How Danilo Restivo was caught], Guardian , 29 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Tobias Jones (writer)|Tobias Jones]] writes, "The case gradually became, for many, an obsession, one of the iconic Italian mysteries that enabled people to engage in ''dietrologia'', literally 'behindery' or conspiracy-theorising. Claps' face—her long, dark hair, thick glasses and carefree smile—haunted the nation."  An acquaintance of Claps said that she had been abducted by criminals. Claps' diary had a page missing; tests suggested that there were words written in [[Albanian language|Albanian]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; A connection to Albania was thought by some to be the most promising line of inquiry. Claps' elder brother, Gildo, alleged that the investigation into his sister's disappearance had been hindered by deference to prominent community figures.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; The investigation was taken away from the Potenza authorities and moved 120&amp;nbsp;km away to [[Salerno]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt;

===Claps's friend suspected===
Claps' close friend who had accompanied her on the day of her disappearance told investigators that she had last seen Claps outside the church at 11:30 a.m., at which point Claps had departed to meet Restivo in the church. She claimed Claps had told her she would be back in half an hour. Prosecutors accused her of lying and suspected her of involvement in the disappearance; they asserted that she had been seen with Claps later in the day.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; The young woman, aged only 16, later confessed to several friends that she was worried and that she could have met the same destiny of Claps if she had been with her.

====Investigation takes wrong track====
The assumption that Claps had subsequently left the church moved the focus of the investigation away from the church building and onto other lines of inquiry; the church was not thoroughly searched.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

=====Italian criminal procedure=====
{{further|Italian Code of Criminal Procedure}}
In Italy, the accused is presumed innocent, and both the defendant and the prosecution can appeal a court's judgment. An appeal triggers what is essentially a ''[[trial de novo]]'', in which all evidence and witnesses can be re-examined.&lt;ref name="Vogt"&gt;Vogt, Andrea: "[http://www.seattlepi.com/local/article/The-debate-continues-over-Knox-s-guilt-882848.php The debate continues over Knox's guilt]," SeattlePI.com, 14 December 2009, accessed 17 October 2011.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pisani"&gt;Pisani, Mario; et al.; Manuale di procedura penale. Bologna, Monduzzi Editore, 2006. {{ISBN|88-323-6109-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A further appeal can be made to the Italian Supreme Court of Cassation (''[[Corte di Cassazione]]''), but only on procedural grounds or on issues of the interpretation of law.&lt;ref name="Pisani" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Povoledo"&gt;Povoledo, Elisabetta: "[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/04/world/europe/amanda-knox-defends-herself-in-italian-court.html?pagewanted=all Amanda Knox Freed After Appeal in Italian Court]", The New York Times, 3 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Trial of Restivo with Claps's friend====
In 1996, Restivo was tried for giving false information. He testified that he had met Claps in a curtained area behind the altar before she left minutes later. He admitted he had previously taken girls to a room on the first floor of the church. In 2010, the remains of Claps were found yards from that location.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1262663/A-body-Italian-church-locks-stolen-hair---chilling-link-British-mothers-murder.html#ixzz1nD1KzOvo A body in an Italian church, locks of stolen hair ... and a chilling link to this British mother's murder], Daily Mail, 1 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Tried along with Restivo were an Albanian man and Claps' close friend. Restivo alone was convicted, he was sentenced to 20 months imprisonment and lost an appeal. Because short sentences are suspended in Italy, Restivo remained free and without restriction on his movements.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt; The prosecution appealed against the acquittal of Claps' friend, and at a second trial she was found guilty on a charge of perjury and sentenced to 14 months' imprisonment; the Italian Supreme Court later overturned the conviction.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;
; Exoneration of Claps' friend
When the body of Claps was discovered, it became clear that her friend had been telling the truth. She testified via a video link at Restivo's trial for murdering Barnett.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/news/9059621.print/ Heather Barnett jury hears more live evidence from Italy] Daily Echo, 1 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murder of Heather Barnett==
In May 2002 Restivo arrived in England, and moved in with a [[Bournemouth]] woman. He lived across the street from Barnett, a mother of two who worked from home as a seamstress. Restivo visited Barnett's flat on 6 November 2002, ostensibly to discuss having curtains made.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1387595/Danilo-Restivo-murdered-mutilated-mother-Heather-Barnett.html#ixzz1n342DCRI Man with fetish for cutting women's hair 'murdered and mutilated mother-of-two'] Daily Mail, 17 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 November 2002, Barnett was found by her children, aged 11 and 14, when they came home from school. She had been bludgeoned to death with a hammer and her breasts, which had been severed, were beside her head. A lock of hair, which was not Barnett's, had been placed in her right hand and some of her own hair was under her left hand.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; The time of death was estimated to be shortly after Barnett had returned home after taking her children to school that morning.

===Investigation===
Restivo was not immediately a person of interest for detectives. Along with his Italian landlady, Fiamma, he was taken to Bournemouth Police station on the evening of the 12th. With no translator to hand, Fiamma translated. At that interview, Restivo produced his timed and dated bus ticket. There were a number of innocent victims arrested prior to Restivo. Restivo was questioned by the Police in mid 2003 and released without charge.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt; At an early stage he had produced a bus ticket with a time-stamp of 8:44 a.m. to support his alibi of having been on his way to a computer course at the time of the murder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/news/9032958.Heather_Barnett_jury_told_of__deliberate_false_alibi__by_Danilo_Restivo/ Heather Barnett jury told of 'deliberate false alibi' by Danilo Restivo], Bournemouth Echo, 18 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The detective heading the inquiry later said that Restivo gave the impression of being "bumbling".&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-dorset-13860477 Heather Barnett murder: Danilo Restivo 'would kill again' fears]. BBC News, 29 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Forensic investigation showed the killer had left few traces at the crime scene. [[Luminol]] tests showed a trail of bloody shoe-prints that ended suddenly, this was thought to indicate the killer had changed his shoes before leaving Barnett's house.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt; Although Barnett's son told police the day after the murder that his mother's keys went missing after Restivo's visit of 6 November, and he was found to have soaked the trainers he had worn on 12 November in bleach,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-dorset-13893888 Heather Barnett murder: Film shows killer watching women], BBC News Dorset, 29 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Restivo was not strongly suspected at first because of his bus ticket.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;

In the light of Restivo's connection to Claps' disappearance and suspicious behaviour&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; detectives regarded him as chief suspect, but there was not sufficient evidence for a prosecution. In March 2004 he was put under close surveillance using electronic tracking and listening devices; police overheard Restivo being spoken to by his parents and female companion as if he were a child.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt; He was observed on repeated visits to a beauty spot where he was covertly filmed as he apparently stalked lone women. On 12 May 2004 the surveillance team became alarmed, a uniformed patrol was ordered to stop and search Restivo on a pretext. Although it was a warm day, he was wearing waterproof over-trousers. In his car police found an identical change of clothing, [[Fillet knife|filleting knife]], scissors, a [[Balaclava (clothing)|balaclava]] and gloves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/crimewatch/solved/howtheycaught/htc_danilo_restivo.shtml How They Caught: Danilo Restivo, Heather Barnett's Killer], BBC Crimewatch, 29 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2004 a schoolgirl identified Restivo as the man who had cut her hair on a bus; in November 2006 he was rearrested and his home searched. Police found a lock of hair. [[Sneakers|Trainers]] he had worn on the day of the murder had traces of blood, but it could not be identified. In 2008 new techniques revealed a bloodstained towel left at the murder scene had a [[DNA profiling|DNA]] match for Restivo, but he claimed to have left it on the visit to the home of Barnett on 6 November.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; The evidence was still judged insufficient for a prosecution.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

===Body of Elisa Claps discovered===
Priest Domenico Sabia from Potenza died in 2008; he had denied ever being acquainted with Restivo, but a photograph of Restivo's 18th birthday party emerged &lt;!-- when? --&gt; that showed Sabia had been one of the guests.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt; In March 2010 a body was found in the church, in a brick alcove beside the [[bell tower]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt; Forensic DNA analysis initially suggested the body was not that of Claps, but on re-testing it was found to be hers.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; Strands of Claps' own hair had been cut from her head shortly after her death and placed near her hands. Italian investigation found DNA and other evidence indicating Restivo was the murderer of Claps.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;
;Restivo charged
In a move that the prosecutor said was unrelated to the Italian investigation, it was decided that the evidence against Restivo was sufficient for a prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cps.gov.uk/wessex/complex_casework_unit/ Complex Casework Unit, Murder- Danilo Restivo], Crown Prosecution Service&lt;/ref&gt; Two months after the remains of Claps were found, Restivo was charged with the murder of Barnett.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;
Elisa's funeral service took place on July 2, 2011, and the holy mass was celebrated by Don Marcello Cozzi, an Italian priest well known for his strong battles against the [[mafia]] and crime.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A large number of people from all Italy took part to the ceremony.

===Trial and appeal===
It was ruled that the English court could hear evidence that Restivo had murdered Elisa Claps in Italy, and about the similarities of that murder with the murder of Barnett. Italian investigators testified to the English court that DNA recovered from the clothes on the body of Claps matched Restivo and was consistent with blood.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/news/heather_barnett_trial/trial/9089217.Restivo_jury_hears_DNA_evidence/ Restivo jury hears DNA evidence], Bourenmouth Echo, 16 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; When in May 2011, Restivo was found guilty of murdering Heather Barnett, the judge sentenced him to spend the rest of his life in prison.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8 /&gt; Appealing against the whole life term, Restivo's lawers argued the judge was wrong to take the Claps' murder into account when sentencing Restivo for the murder of Barnett, as Restivo had not been convicted of it at that time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-dorset-19904969 'Hair-in-hand' killer Danilo Restivo in appeal], BBC news broadcast, 10 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2012 the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] ruled in favour of Restivo and altered his minimum sentence to 40 years, but said it was "highly improbable" he would ever be released.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-dorset-20436668 Danilo Restivo's whole life tariff reduced to 40 years], BBC News Dorset, 21 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 Restivo appealed against a decision he should be deported, the [[Home Secretary]] having ordered his transfer to Italy, where he would be jailed for life.&lt;ref&gt;Bournemouth Echo, 19 February 2014.[http://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/news/11019440.Killer_Danilo_Restivo_fighting_plans_to_deport_him_to_Italy_by_claiming_right_to_family_life/?ref=var_0 Killer Danilo Restivo fighting plans to deport him to Italy by claiming right to family life]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dov Zakin''' ({{lang-he|דב זכין}}, 1922 &amp;ndash; 4 September 1986) was an [[Israel]]i politician who served as a member of the [[Knesset]] for the [[Alignment (political party)|Alignment]] and [[Mapam]] between 1969 and 1977 and again from 1981 until 1984.

==Biography==
Born in [[Baranovichi]] in [[Poland]] in 1922, Zakin made [[aliyah]] to [[Mandatory Palestine]] in 1936. He was educated at the [[Ben Shemen Youth Village]], before studying political Science and economics at [[Tel Aviv University]].

In 1945 he was amongst the founders of kibbutz [[Lehavot HaBashan]]. The following year he helped found the [[Wadi Ara]] branch of the Eretz Yisrael Workers Union. In 1950, 1952 and 1963 he travelled to the [[United States]] as an emissary for [[Hashomer Hatzair]], and between 1959 and 1961 served as secretary of the Peace Movement.

A member of the Mapam secretariat, he was elected to the Knesset on the Alignment list (an alliance of Mapam and the [[Israeli Labor Party|Labor Party]]) in [[Israeli legislative election, 1969|1969]]. He was re-elected in [[Israeli legislative election, 1973|1973]], and in 1977 was part of the Mapam faction that briefly broke away from the Alignment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.knesset.gov.il/faction/eng/FactionHistoryAll_eng.asp Mergers and Splits Among Parliamentary Groups] Knesset website&lt;/ref&gt; He lost his seat in the [[Israeli legislative election, 1977|1977 elections]], but returned to the Knesset after the [[Israeli legislative election, 1981|1981 elections]]. He lost his seat for a final time in [[Israeli legislative election, 1984|1984]]. In 1986 he became a member of the board of directors of the [[World Zionist Organization]].

He died in 1986.

'''Eddie Carmel''' (March 16, 1936 &amp;ndash; August 14, 1972) was an entertainer with [[gigantism]] and subsequent [[acromegaly]] resulting from a [[pituitary adenoma]]. Popularly known as "The [[Jews|Jewish]] [[Gigantism|Giant]]", Carmel was billed at the height of 8&amp;nbsp;ft 9 in (268&amp;nbsp;cm) and 9&amp;nbsp;ft 0.625 (276&amp;nbsp;cm) inches tall, though he may have more realistically been around 7&amp;nbsp;ft 3 tall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thetallestman.com/eddiecarmel.htm |title=The Tallest Man - Eddie Carmel}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of his [[death]] at age 36, he had shrunk several inches, due to [[kyphoscoliosis]] (curvature of the spine, a mixture of [[scoliosis]], and [[kyphosis]]).

== Early life ==
Oded Ha-Carmeili (Hebrew: עודד הכרמלי) was born in [[Tel Aviv]], [[Mandatory Palestine]], to American-Jewish immigrants. An only child, he was raised in [[the Bronx]], [[New York (state)|New York]], after his parents Itzhak and Miriam (née Pines) Ha-Carmeili relocated back to the [[United States]] when he was a young boy. "Eddie" was his nickname from his youth, and Carmel was a stage surname. He was made famous by [[photographer]] [[Diane Arbus]]' picture ''Jewish Giant, taken at Home with His Parents in the Bronx, N.Y.'' in 1970.

== Career ==
Due to his condition, his primary work was in carnival sideshows, including appearances at Hubert's Museum in Times Square and a few films such as'' 50,000 B.C. (Before Clothing)'' (1963), and ''[[The Brain That Wouldn't Die]]'' (1962). He died at age 36, in [[Montefiore Medical Center|Montefiore Hospital]] in [[the Bronx, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Eddie Carmel, 500-Pound Giant At Ringling Circus, Dies at 36|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1972/07/31/90718277.html?pageNumber=30|accessdate=20 April 2016|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 31, 1972|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

G4S has its origins in a guarding business founded in [[Copenhagen]] in 1901 by Marius Hogrefe, originally known as ''København Frederiksberg Nattevagt'' (''Copenhagen and [[Frederiksberg]] Night Watch'') and subsequently renamed ''[[Falck (Denmark)|Falck]]'' (''[[Falcon]]'').&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web

G4S was formed in July 2004, when Group 4 Falck's security business merged with [[Securicor]] to create Group 4 Securicor and began trading on both the London and [[Copenhagen Stock Exchange]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitallook.com/investing/visual_tools/security.cgi?csi=104331&amp;ac=&amp;username=|title=G4S Share Price |publisher=digitallook.com|access-date=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, Lars Nørby Johansen was succeeded as chief executive by Nick Buckles and, in 2006, the new G4S brand identity was rolled out across its business worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/people/person.asp?personId=2173401&amp;ticker=WDH:DC&amp;previousCapId=426471&amp;previousTitle=WILLIAM%20DEMANT%20HOLDING "Lars Nørby Johansen"].

In 2006, 2007 and 2008, G4S was the subject of a global campaign by union workers alleging that its subsidiaries undermine labour and human rights standards. Some of these groups were organised under the banner of the [[SEIU]]-funded Focus on Group 4 Securicor.&lt;ref&gt;

The strike imperiled the operations of the court system in the state of Victoria. The guards provided entry-point screening for weapons and bombs in both the County Court and Magistrates Court, as well as additional security in the court rooms themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unitedvoice.org.au/news/g4s-security-strike-could-shut-down-court-system "G4S Security Strike Could Shut Down Court System"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322153708/http://unitedvoice.org.au/news/g4s-security-strike-could-shut-down-court-system/ |date=22 March 2012 }}.

====Acquisitions of Guidance Monitoring and Chubb====
In April 2011, G4S acquired Guidance Monitoring, an international designer and manufacturer of electronic monitoring technologies, including hardware and software used for offender monitoring and tracking.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130126113505/http://www.info4security.com/story.asp?storycode=4127274 "Guidance Monitoring Operation Bought by G4S"]. Info4 Security. 27 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2011, G4S acquired the assets of Chubb Emergency Response, a large key holding company in the UK. The deal was finalised on 17 December 2011. The business has now been integrated into their existing key holding and response service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insidermedia.com/insider/south-east/66635-g4s-locks-down-17m-chubb-deal "G4S Locks Down £17m Chubb Deal"].

====Aborted acquisition of ISS====
On 17 October 2011, G4S announced it would purchase the Denmark-based facilities management group [[ISS A/S]] for £5.2&amp;nbsp;billion. The acquisition would have created the world's largest facilities management company.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-15331424 "G4S Shares Tumble on £5.2bn ISS Takeover Deal"]. [[BBC News]].&lt;/ref&gt; Within two weeks, the deal was dropped due to lack of shareholder support.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/supportservices/8863291/G4Ss-deal-for-ISS-buckled-under-the-weight-of-shareholder-anger.html "G4S's Deal for ISS Buckled Under the Weight of Shareholder Anger"]. ''The Telegraph''. 1 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; G4S's chief, Nick Buckles, recounted the events of the failed acquisition, which cost the company tens of millions of dollars, as "...one of the most bruising experiences of my life".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/supportservices/8870907/G4S-chief-Nick-Buckles-The-ISS-deal-failure-has-been-one-of-the-most-bruising-experiences-of-my-life.html "G4S Chief Nick Buckles: 'The ISS deal failure has been one of the most bruising experiences of my life'"]. ''The Telegraph''. 5 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; A combination of institutional investors who led the response and the minority shareholders who followed, objected to a variety of factors, not the least of which was the additional leverage and debt the deal would introduce to G4S's balance sheet. General consensus is that lack of planning for shareholder response on the G4S side doomed the deal. Furthermore, many investors and analysts questioned why the company would want to purchase a firm so far removed from its area of expertise.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/supportservices/8843221/Has-UK-security-giant-G4S-lost-the-plot.html "Has G4S Security Lost the Plot?"].

In March 2012, G4S announced that it would sell the "struggling" G4S Government Solutions business (the former Wackenhut (WSI) and All Star business) to exit the US government services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/05/us-g4s-idUSBRE9240JQ20130305 |title=Security Firm G4S to Sell Struggling U.S. Government Arm |agency=Reuters |access-date=21 August 2013 |first=Neil |last=Maidment |date=5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2013, Buckles resigned as chief executive of G4S with £1.2&amp;nbsp;million payoff and was replaced by [[Ashley Almanza]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/may/21/g4s-nick-buckles-quits|title=Nick Buckles Quits as Chief Executive of G4S with £1.2m Payoff| work = [[The Guardian]] |date=21 May 2013|access-date=8 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Failure to meet London 2012 Security Contract====
On 12 July 2012, it was announced that 3,500 British troops would be deployed at the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] due to a shortage of adequately trained G4S security staff, with Labour MP [[Keith Vaz]] claiming that, "G4S has let the country down and we have literally had to send in the troops".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-18813729 |title=Olympics Security Not Compromised, Theresa May Says |publisher= BBC News |date=12 July 2012 |access-date=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shares in G4S later dropped 9 percent after the firm claimed it faced a possible £50&amp;nbsp;million loss as a result of failing to provide sufficient trained staff for the 2012 Olympic Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-18856922 |title=G4S Olympics Staff 'Failed to Arrive' for Security Work |publisher= BBC News |date=16 July 2012 |access-date=16 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 July, the company's chief executive, Nick Buckles, appeared before the [[Home Affairs Select Committee]], where he apologised for the organisational failings, expressed regret at having taken on the Olympic security contract, and agreed in principle to pay bonuses to soldiers drafted at the last moment as replacement security staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = London 2012: G4S's Nick Buckles Regrets Taking Contract | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-18866153 | publisher = BBC News | date =17 July 2012  | access-date = 17 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pressed by Labour MP [[David Winnick]], he was forced to admit that organisational situation had become a "humiliating shambles".&lt;ref name=teen&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/video/2012/jul/17/g4s-boss-humiliating-shambles-video?newsfeed=true |title=G4S Boss Admits to 'Humiliating Shambles' over Olympic Security | work = [[The Guardian]] | location=London |date=17 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Newcastle, G4S was replaced by 500 staff from local security firms for Olympic events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-18951304 | publisher = BBC News | title=London 2012: Queen Hails Olympic 'Dedication' | date=24 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In Scotland, G4S was stripped of the security role with it passing to Strathclyde Police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-18929058 | publisher = BBC News |title=Strathclyde Police to Control Scots Olympic security | date=20 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Dorney Lake, the Olympic rowing and canoeing venue, a G4S manager reported G4S radios were not working, so staff were relying on personal mobile phones to communicate; G4S confirmed the venue was being manned by military personnel after 66 percent of rostered G4S staff were failing to show.  The venue manager reported parts of the CCTV system had already been replaced by Army patrols and a complete army takeover was "on the cards".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-berkshire-18913635 | publisher = BBC News | title=London 2012: Dorney Lake Security 'a Shambles' | date=20 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 July 2012, a contractor reported that a third of his expected staff had not turned up; instead, he was sent a group of mainly female, teenage students with minimal training, whom he turned away as he did not feel comfortable leaving them for night duties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Judd  | first = Terri  | title = G4S Shambles Revealed in Internal Report: One Operator Says He Was Sent Teenage Girls to Guard a Games Venue at Night| url = https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/olympics/news/g4s-shambles-revealed-in-internal-report-7965137.html | work = [[The Independent]] | date = 23 July 2012 | access-date = 23 July 2012 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 August 2012, G4S announced that it had finally contracted enough employees to fully fulfil its contract for the Olympic games. Although missing its initial target of 10,000, G4S announced the sending of 7,000 personnel each day to Olympic venues, in a way they felt would allow them to fully secure each venue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://espn.go.com/olympics/summer/2012/story/_/id/8246519/2012-london-olympics-private-contractor-g4s-fills-olympic-security-quota "G4S Fills Olympic Security Quota"]. [[ESPN]]. 8 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent to the Olympics contract failures, the chief constables of Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire were to recommend abandoning outsourcing work to G4S.  They were backed by [[Jim Paice]], the agriculture minister and Conservative MP for South East Cambridgeshire.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-18924979 "Chief Constables Want to Abandon G4S Scheme"].

''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sale of Wackenhut Pakistan====
G4S announced in late August 2012 that it would be selling its Pakistan division, Wackenhut Pakistan Limited, to its chairman [[Ikram Sehgal]] for a figure of around $10&amp;nbsp;million, according to the ''[[Financial Times]]''.&lt;ref name=WPL&gt;

[[Ikram Sehgal|Sehgal]] disputed this figure, calling it "speculative"  to the ''[[Express Tribune]]''.&lt;ref name=WPL /&gt;

G4S was one of the nominees for the 2013 [[Public Eye Award]], a counter-event created by NGOs, which awards the worst company of the year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publiceye.ch/en/vote/g4s/ "Public Eye"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130324024111/http://www.publiceye.ch/en/vote/g4s/ |date=24 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Employee Omar Mateen====
G4S was in the news in June 2016 because of employee [[Omar Mateen]], the gunman behind one of the worst mass-shooting incidents in United States history,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/06/12/us/why-the-orlando-shooting-was-so-deadly.html|title= Why the Orlando Shooting Was So Deadly|work = [[The New York Times]] |access-date=21 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was employed as a security guard by the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theeventchronicle.com/orlando-shooting/orlando-shooter-omar-mateen-not-first-g4s-employee-go-deadly-rampage/ |title=Orlando Shooter Omar Mateen Not First G4S Employee to Go on Deadly Rampage|publisher=Event Chronicle|access-date=21 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2006, Mateen had begun working as a recruit for the [[Florida Department of Corrections]], being assigned to the Martin Correctional Institution. In a letter explaining his juvenile record as part of his successful application, Mateen explained the incident of when he was arrested at school when he was fourteen. Following the [[Virginia Tech shooting]] in April 2007, Mateen suggested in a corrections officer training class that he would bring a gun to class. P.H. Skipper, who was the warden at institution, wrote that "in light of the tragic events at Virginia Tech officer Mateen's inquiry about bringing a weapon to class is at best extremely disturbing".

Mateen held an active [[concealed carry permit]] and an [[security guard|armed security guard]] licence. He was said to have passed a psychological test and medical exam performed by Dr. Syed Shafeeq Rahman, who had close ties with Mateen's family. It was also noted that Mateen had no criminal record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/pulse-orlando-nightclub-shooting/os-orlando-nightclub-omar-mateen-profile-20160613-story.html|title=Witness: Omar Mateen drank alone at Pulse before attack|last2=Brinkmann|first2=Paul|date=21 December 2016|work=Orlando Sentinel|last3=Stutzman|first3=Rene|first1=Gal Tziperman|last1=Lotan|accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to licensing records, he was a proficient shooter who scored in the 98th [[percentile]] with a [[9mm]] semiautomatic pistol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/nation/state-slaps-150000-fine-on-security-firm-that-employed-orlando-shooter/2292978|title=State slaps $150,000 fine on security firm that employed Orlando Pulse shooter Omar Mateen|work=The Tampa Bay Times|date=9 September 2016|accessdate=21 December 2016|first=Anthony|last=Cormier}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the shooting, a psychologist, who was said to have evaluated and cleared Mateen for his firearms licence in 2007, according to the records of the security company G4S, denied ever meeting him or having lived in Florida at the time, and said she had stopped her practice in Florida in January 2006. G4S admitted Mateen's form had a "clerical error", and clarified that he had instead been cleared by Rahman, who was from the same firm that bought the wrongly-named doctor's practice. Rahman had not interviewed Mateen, but evaluated the results of a standard test used in the screening he undertook before being hired.&lt;ref name=clerical/&gt;

==== Birmingham Prison ====

In October 2011, the security firm spent £499,000 replacing all the locks and keys at HMP Birmingham. A G4S spokesman acknowledged: "As has previously been extensively reported," this loss happened 18 days after G4S took over the prison in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Crone |first=Jack |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2827303/G4S-forced-spend-500-000-changing-locks-prison-blundering-guards-lost-keys.html#ixzz4CK0dK400 |title=G4S forced to spend £500k changing ALL the locks at prison &amp;#124; Daily Mail Online |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date=9 November 2014 |accessdate=15 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 December 2016, some 600 prisoners took part in a riot at [[HM Prison Birmingham]], a prison in [[Birmingham]], England, operated by G4S.&lt;ref name="Halliday"&gt;Josh Halliday, [https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/dec/18/birmingham-prison-riot-government-was-warned-two-months-earlier Birmingham prison riot: government was warned two months earlier], ''The Guardian''.&lt;/ref&gt; The disturbance was described as the worst in Britain since the 1990 Strangeways riot.&lt;ref name="Halliday"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Haddad"&gt;Tareq Haddad, [http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/rioters-hmp-birmingham-will-face-full-force-law-1597011 240 inmates moved after 12 hour riot at G4S prison], ''[[International Business Times]]'' (17 December 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; The national chairman of the [[POA (trade union)|Prison Officers Association]] said more than 30 officers at the prison had quit in the weeks before the riot and that further prison convulsions were inevitable.&lt;ref name="Halliday"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Haddad"/&gt;

In a statement to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]], [[Secretary of State for Justice]] [[Elizabeth Truss]] said that insufficient staffing lay at the root of the twelve-hour Birmingham riot and that G4S would have to pay the costs of deploying ten highly trained public sector Tornado elite teams, who were sent to quell the riot.&lt;ref name="Travis"&gt;Alan Travis, [https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/dec/19/g4s-must-pay-for-cost-of-birmingham-prison-riot-says-liz-truss G4S must pay for cost of Birmingham prison riot, says Liz Truss], ''The Guardian'' (19 December 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; John Thornhill, the president of the independent monitoring board, agreed that insufficient staff had caused rising levels of violence in prisons in [[England and Wales]], leading to "unrestrained violence" and the transfer of a "large number of prisoners ... to other prisons that are already stretched with their own problems and staffing issues."&lt;ref name="Travis"/&gt;

In August 2018 its contract to run Birmingham Prison was revoked, after [[Peter Clarke (police officer)|Peter Clarke]], the Government's [[Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons|Chief Inspector of Prisons]] reported that it was the worst he had ever visited.&lt;ref name="Shaw"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Shaw |first1=Danny |title='Crisis' prison taken over by government |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-45240742 |website=BBC News |accessdate=20 August 2018 |date=20 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Profit margins====
Ben Saunders, the head of two British immigrant centers that have been the locus of abuse of detainees was put on leave in September 2017. A parliamentary committee chair and the Opposition Labour shadow home secretary complained that G4S's contract with the Home Office limited it to a 6.8% profit on operations, but instead the pre-tax profit margins appear to have ranged between 20% to 30%. Saunders had previously directed the Medway Secure Training Centre where juveniles had been found to have been abused before G4S had divested itself of its youth detention component.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/15/head-of-scandal-hit-g4s-detention-centres-ben-saunders-is-put-on-administrative-leave Head of scandal-hit G4S detention centres is put on administrative leave], ''[[The Guardian]]'', Simon Hattenstone and Eric Allison, 15 September 2017.

===Activities===
[[File:G4S Västberga 2009.jpg|thumb|right|The former G4S offices in Västberga, Stockholm]]
G4S's core services include 'manned security services' – where it provides trained and screened security officers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://utahpeoplespost.com/2013/04/g4ss-top-pick-rating-reaffirmed-at-rbc-capital-gfs/ "People's Post"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130710025458/http://utahpeoplespost.com/2013/04/g4ss-top-pick-rating-reaffirmed-at-rbc-capital-gfs/ |date=10 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company also provides 'security systems' such as access control, CCTV, intruder alarms, fire detection, video analytics and security and building systems integration technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livemint.com/Companies/dhG2p6FScwD7GoZAzX36KN/G4S-plans-to-target-IT-infrastructure-and-hospitality-secto.html|title=G4S Plans to Target IT, Infrastructure and Hospitality Sectors|work=Livemint|access-date=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'Monitoring and response services' is another core service, where G4S provides key holding, mobile security patrol and response services and alarm receiving and monitoring facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prosecurityzone.com/News_Detail_G4s_monitoring_and_response_gains_new_md_4294.asp|title=ProSecurityZone: G4S Monitoring and Response Gains New MD (G4S Secure Solutions (UK and Ireland))|publisher=prosecurityzone.com|access-date=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; G4S also provides 'secure facilities services' which includes integrated facilities services for entire sites or estates for commercial customers and governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infologue.com/company-news/g4s-wins-major-ministry-of-justice-integrated-facilities-services-contract/|title=G4S Wins Major Ministry of Justice Integrated Facilities Services Contract|publisher=infologue.com|access-date=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The business provides 'risk management and consultancy services' which also includes mine detection and clearance services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stoplandmines.org/org.asp?o=116 E-Mine] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130710025426/http://www.stoplandmines.org/org.asp?o=116 |date=10 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; G4S also provides electronic tagging and monitoring of offenders at home or in the community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.securityoracle.com/news/G4S-Secures-Half-Year-Profits-Boost_18748.html "Security Oracle"].&lt;/ref&gt; The company provides back-office support functions for police forces, support for front-line policing, including the provision of custody suite services and forensic medical services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-lincolnshire-22338332|title= G4S Claims Improved Lincolnshire 999 Call Answer Times| publisher = BBC News |access-date=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also manages juvenile and adult custody centres. This includes the management of all aspects of a facility and those held within the facility – similar centres are also used for the detention of asylum applicants.  Prisoner escorting is another core service. G4S transports prisoners and asylum applicants between courts, police stations and custody centres.&lt;ref name=ar2012&gt;[http://www.g4s.com/~/media/Files/Annual%20Reports/g4s_annual_report_2012.ashx "G4S Annual Report 2012"].

In 2013, G4S Forensic and Medical Services were awarded a three-year contract to run services providing medical examinations and counselling for victims of rape and sexual assault in the West Midlands. It has been working in this area since 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=G4S contract to run sexual assault referral centres damned|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/may/24/g4s-contract-sexual-assault-referral-centres|access-date=9 September 2014| work = [[The Guardian]] |date=24 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The firm provides patient transport services for NHS Trusts including [[Barking, Havering and Redbridge University Hospitals NHS Trust]]; [[Surrey and Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust]]; [[St George's Healthcare NHS Trust]] (£2.7&amp;nbsp;million a year), and [[Epsom and St Helier University Hospitals NHS Trust]] (£3.5&amp;nbsp;million a year).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=What Is G4S Doing in England's NHS?|url=https://www.opendemocracy.net/ournhs/caroline-molloy/what-is-g4s-doing-in-englands-nhs|access-date=9 September 2014|publisher=Open Democracy|date=15 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of G4S' more interesting contracts may be securing the perimeter of Homey Airport, more commonly known as [[Area 51]], the secret [[United States Air Force]] base in Nevada. The base is guarded by civilians forces referred to by those who watch the base as [[Cammo Dudes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=AgentZero |url=http://www.area51.org/area-51-camo-dudes/ |title=Area 51 Camo Dudes: Lethal Force Authorized |publisher=Area51.org |date= |accessdate=18 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As neither the US Government nor Military will discuss Area 51 there is no official answer on who the guards work for however as a result of evidence pieced together from a leaked handbook for the guards and local job adverts it is widely believed they work for G4S. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bult |first=Laura |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/camo-dudes-patrol-area-51-article-1.2828248/ |title=Here's what we know about the 'Cammo Dudes' who patrol Area 51 |publisher=NY Daily News |date=12 October 2016 |accessdate=18 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operating structure===
G4S segments its business into two areas:&lt;ref name=ar2012/&gt;
* ''[[G4S Secure Solutions|Secure Solutions]]'' which includes services for commercial and government organisations in areas such as risk consulting, manned security, and security systems.

==Corporate social responsibility==
In 2011, G4S became a signatory to the [[UN Global Compact]], the international standard to promote socially responsible business behaviour including human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unglobalcompact.org/participant/13247|title=G4S plc|publisher=unglobalcompact.org|access-date=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, G4S launched a Human Rights Policy, co-authored by Dr Hugo Slim, an internationally recognised human rights expert, aiming to align the company's practices with 'UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights' and to introduce additional global guidelines for areas not currently covered by existing standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adsadvance.co.uk/g4s-launches-landmark-human-rights-policy.html|title=ADS Advance – G4S Launches Landmark Human Rights Policy|publisher=adsadvance.co.uk|access-date=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.business-humanrights.org/Links/Repository/1018464|title=[PDF] Human Rights Policy| publisher =business-humanrights.org|access-date=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Horst Fascher''' (born 5 February 1936) is a German music business figure who was a friend and business associate of [[the Beatles]] during their early career [[The Beatles in Hamburg|playing in Hamburg, Germany]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
Horst Fascher was born in [[Hamburg]], Germany, on 5 February 1936. His mother was a cleaning lady and his father was a seaman who fought in World War II, subsequently being held as a prisoner of war by the Soviet Union until 1951. As a young man, Fascher was a promising amateur [[Boxing|boxer]], becoming [[flyweight]] champion of West Germany. He had been expected to represent his country at the [[1960 Summer Olympics|1960 Olympics]], but after accidentally killing a sailor in a street fight he served six months in prison and was given a lifetime ban from boxing. After his release, Fascher became involved in the emerging [[rock and roll]] scene around Hamburg's [[Reeperbahn]], working as a barman and [[Bouncer (doorman)|bouncer]] in the music clubs and managing groups.&lt;ref name="NY Times"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bernstein|first1=Richard|authorlink1=Richard Bernstein|title=Memories of Hamburg, Enough to Build a Dream On|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/08/world/europe/08fascher.html|accessdate=29 March 2017|work=The New York Times|date=8 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MancalledHorst"&gt;{{cite web|first=Bill|last=Harry|authorlink=Bill Harry|url=http://www.triumphpc.com/mersey-beat/beatles/horst.shtml |title=A Man called Horst|work=Mersey Beat|publisher=Triumph PC|accessdate=12 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Beatles===
When the Beatles (including original drummer [[Pete Best]] and bassist [[Stuart Sutcliffe]]) made their first trip to Germany in August 1960, Fascher befriended the young group, who played at the [[Indra Club]] and the [[Kaiserkeller]]. As they rose through the ranks of bands playing the Reeperbahn (making five trips in all over the next two-and-a-half years), Fascher usually managed to be working at the same clubs, and for the same boss, as the Beatles. They visited him at home, and he in turn kept troublemakers away from the band. The only favour Fascher asked was to be able to sing with them occasionally onstage, which was granted; [[Eddie Cochran]]'s music was a common choice.

The Beatles (with Best now replaced by [[Ringo Starr]], and [[Paul McCartney]] changing to bass when Sutcliffe departed) did not want to make their last Hamburg visit, at the end of 1962, preferring to stay in England to promote their new [[single record|single]], "[[Love Me Do]]", but were persuaded by manager [[Brian Epstein]], via Horst Fascher, who recalled later "I had to give him thirty [[German mark|mark]]s [[bribery|under the table]] to make him do it." Nonetheless, the band had a holiday residency at the [[Star-Club]] (which Fascher co-ran), through the New Year.

Fascher guested with the Beatles during their [[New Year's Eve]] show, which was recorded by another [[Liverpool]] musician, [[Kingsize Taylor|Ted "Kingsize" Taylor]]. Years later (in 1977), the tape was released commercially as ''[[Live! at the Star-Club in Hamburg, Germany; 1962]]''. A song from the album, "[[Hallelujah, I Love Her So]]", features Horst Fascher's vocals. Another song, "[[Be-Bop-A-Lula]]", features his brother Fred's vocals.

Fascher remained a friend and admirer of the band years after they became famous. Some of his stories about the band's Hamburg days (and his impressions of the young Beatles) have found their way into music biographies, including [[Philip Norman (author)|Philip Norman]]'s ''Shout!''. His own memoir was published in 2006.

[[File:Coa fam ITA sanclemente.jpg|180px|thumb|right|Arms of the House of Santcliment.]]

The '''House of Santcliment''' is an aristocratic and [[Nobility|noble]] [[spanish people|Spanish]] [[Catalan people|Catalan]] House.

== History ==

===Branch of Lleida===

The House of Santcliment was established by Tomàs de Santcliment, lord of [[Mequinenza]] between 1230 and 1244. He was granted authority by [[James I of Aragon]] over the castles of Cinca, Malda, and Maldanell as a reward for his participation in the [[conquest of Valencia]]. He bought the castle of Alcarrás from Guillem de Cardona in 1249.  

In the fourteenth century the members of this branch resided on ''carrer Major'' of [[Lleida]] and lorded over territories that include [[Alcarràs]], Montagut, [[Sarroca de Lleida]], [[Llardecans]], and Vilanova de Remolins. The house also owned large estates in [[Flix]] and [[La Palma d'Ebre]] (the last two were sold to Barcelona in 1398). 

Francesc de Santcliment, is one of the notable figures in the Lleida branch of the House of Santcliment. He served under [[Peter IV of Aragon]], who sent him as ambassador to Avignon in 1336 and as a defender of the Aran Valley against the bishop of Comminges. Francesc founded the family chapel in the cathedral of Lleida. One of his children, Pere, was chancellor of the university of Lleida (1387-1403), canon, and then [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Lleida|bishop of Lleida]]. His other son Francesc was ''paer'' in 1380 and ''veguer'' in 1413. The son of Francesc, Bernat de Santcliment, carried out a long lawsuit against the chapter of Lleida due to a dispute over a property near Montagut, which he lost. He also fought in the war against [[John II of Aragon]] in 1467 and was ''paer''. By the sixteenth century, this branch was already in decline after losing Alcarrás, Sarroca, and Llardecans.

===Branch of Barcelona===

Pere de Santcliment was the first prominent member of the Santcliment branch in Barcelona. He was mentioned by James I of Aragon as "our scribe." The members of this branch continued to serve as ''notari major'' of the [[Chancery (medieval office)|chancery]] under [[Peter III of Aragon]]. The court positions held by the House helped this Barcelona branch amass fortune. The Santcliments continued to invest in the purchase of lands in addition to their small lordship near the Catalan capital in order to ensure their relevance to the group of distinguished citizens. The Barcelona barnch of the Santcliment had a rich heritage and their legacy can be traced in their properties in and around Barcelona and these include: the ''torre de Bell-lloc'' in Sant Andreu de Palomar, consisting of mills and farms; the ''Torre Vella'' in Badalona; the ''casa de la Murtra''  near Santa Coloma. In addition, the Santcliment was granted land holdings after the conquest of [[Sardinia]] and a member of this house was part of Spain's campaign to control the island.

'''Igor Vamos''', born April 15, 1968, is an internationally known multimedia artist, leading member of [[The Yes Men]] (using the alias '''Michael "Mike" Bonanno'''), and an [[associate professor]] of media arts at [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]].&lt;ref name="guggenheim"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rpi.edu/web/Campus.News/may_03/may_5/vamos.htm|title=Igor Vamos Wins Prestigious Guggenheim Fellowship|publisher=Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute Campus News|date=May 5, 2003|accessdate=2008-07-03|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080908053730/http://www.rpi.edu/web/Campus.News/may_03/may_5/vamos.htm|archivedate=2008-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, he received the [[Creative Capital]] award in the discipline of Emerging Fields. &lt;ref&gt;(http://creative-capital.org/projects/view/326)&lt;/ref&gt;  He is also a co-founder of [[RTmark]] and the recipient of a [[List of Guggenheim Fellowships awarded in 2003|2003 Guggenheim Fellowship]], granted for a project that used [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) and other wireless technology to create a new medium with which to "view" his documentary ''Grounded'', about an abandoned military base in [[Wendover, Utah]].&lt;ref name="guggenheim"/&gt;

In 1990, Vamos earned an undergraduate degree in Studio Art from [[Reed College]] in [[Portland, Oregon]]. He later earned an MFA in Visual Arts from the [[University of California, San Diego]]. While at Reed, Vamos organized a student group called Guerrilla Theater of the Absurd. They performed and documented "culture jamming" acts of protest, including ''Reverse Peristalsis Painters'', where 24 people in suits stood outside the downtown venue of [[Dan Quayle]]'s fundraiser for Oregon senator [[Bob Packwood]] and drank [[ipecac]], forcing themselves to vomit the red, white and blue remains of the mashed potatoes and food coloring they had consumed earlier; and a middle of the night contribution to the debate over renaming Portland's [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] Boulevard, wherein the city awoke to find that all of the street signs and freeway exits for another major boulevard had been changed to read "[[Malcolm X]] Street."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vdb.org/smackn.acgi$tapedetail?UNDENIABLE Video Data Bank page for Vamos film "Undeniable Evidence."]&lt;/ref&gt;

Vamos made ''Le petomane: Fin de siècle fartiste'' (1998)&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|250656|Le petomane: Fin de siècle fartiste}}&lt;/ref&gt; about the French [[flatulist]] and entertainer [[Joseph Pujol]], a humorous deconstruction in the style of a [[PBS]] documentary.&lt;ref name="Langlois"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fondation-langlois.org/html/e/page.php?NumPage=37|title=Igor Vamos (biography)|last=Bonin|first=Vincent|year=2002|publisher=[[Daniel Langlois Foundation]]|accessdate=26 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another early project was the "[[Barbie Liberation Organization]]", where Vamos and his cohorts purchased three hundred [[Barbie]] and [[G.I. Joe]] dolls, exchanged their electronic voice boxes, and then returned them to the stores; the soldiers ended up saying, "Let's go shopping!", and the Barbies exclaimed, "Vengeance is mine!". It was a small-scale project, and few people found themselves in possession of the switched dolls. The stunt nevertheless attracted national media attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/visualart/cool24.shtml|title=Cool irony is hot with a new generation of artists |last=Hackett|first=Regina|date=2004-04-24|work=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]|accessdate=2008-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vamos presented the Reed College Commencement Speech on May 19, 2014, where he announced that the college had decided to [[Disinvestment|divest]] from [[fossil fuels]],&lt;ref name="Reed"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yeslab.org/reed-college-commencement-speech-2014|title=Reed College Commencement Speech 2014|publisher=Yes Lab|accessdate=25 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; a decision the college has in fact not yet made.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2014/05/igor_vamos_pranks_reed_college.html "Igor Vamos of 'Yes Men' pranks Reed College during commencement speech," The Oregonian, May 20, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://portlandtribune.com/pt/9-news/221203-82343-yes-men-prankster-fools-media-with-hoax-about-reed-divestment- "Yes Men prankster fools media with hoax about Reed divestment," Portland Tribune, May 19, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

The story of Isaac is important in the [[Abrahamic religion]]s including Judaism, Christianity and Islam. Many modern scholars doubt the existence of figures from Genesis, including Isaac.&lt;ref name="EvansLohr2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Craig A. Evans|author2=Joel N. Lohr|author3=David L. Petersen|title=The Book of Genesis: Composition, Reception, and Interpretation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tB77B7HT23wC&amp;pg=PA64|date=20 March 2012|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-22653-1|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The [[Anglicisation|anglicized]] name Isaac is a transliteration of the Hebrew term ''Yiṣḥāq'' (יִצְחָק) which literally means "He laughs/will laugh." [[Ugaritic language|Ugaritic]] texts dating from the 13th century BCE refer to the benevolent smile of the [[Canaanite religion|Canaanite]] deity [[El (deity)|El]].&lt;ref name="EoR-Isaac"/&gt; Genesis, however, ascribes the laughter to Isaac's parents, Abraham and Sarah, rather than El. According to the biblical narrative, Abraham fell on his face and laughed when God (Hebrew, ''[[Elohim]]'') imparted the news of their son's eventual birth. He laughed because Sarah was past the age of childbearing; both she and Abraham were advanced in age. Later, when Sarah overheard three messengers of the Lord renew the promise, she laughed inwardly for the same reason. Sarah denied laughing when God questioned Abraham about it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Genesis|17:15–19|HE}} {{Bibleverse-nb||Genesis|18:10–15|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter=Isaac|chapter-url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=174&amp;letter=I&amp;search=Isaac|first=Isidore|last=Singer|authorlink=Isidore Singer|year=1901–1906|title=Jewish Encyclopedia|publisher=Funk &amp; Wagnalls|location=New York|first2=Isaac|last2=Broydé|authorlink2=Isaac Broydé|editor-first=Isidore|editor-last=Singer|editor-link=Isidore Singer|editor2-first=Cyrus|editor2-last=Adler|editor2-link=Cyrus Adler|display-editors=etal|title-link=Jewish Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter=Sarah (Sarai)|chapter-url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=245&amp;letter=S&amp;search=sarah|first=Emil G.|last=Hirsch|authorlink=Emil G.

In Amos, Isaac is spelled not with a צ but with a ש - Amos 7:9 ישחק.

==Genesis narrative==

===Birth===
It was prophesied to the patriarch Abraham that he would have a son and that his name should be Isaac. When Abraham became one hundred years old, this son was born to him by his first wife Sarah.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|18:10–12|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though this was Abraham's second son&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|16:15|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was Sarah's first and only child.

On the eighth day from his birth, Isaac was [[Religious male circumcision|circumcised]], as was necessary for all males of Abraham's household, in order to be in compliance with [[Yahweh]]'s covenant.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|21:1–5|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Isaac had been weaned, Sarah saw [[Ishmael]] mocking, and urged her husband to cast out [[Hagar]] the bondservant and her son, so that Isaac would be Abraham's sole heir. Abraham was hesitant, but at God's order he listened to his wife's request.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|21:8–12|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Binding===
[[File:Beit alfa02.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The ''Akedah'', mosaic on the floor of [[Beit Alfa Synagogue]]]]
{{main article|Binding of Isaac}}

At some point in Isaac's youth, his father Abraham brought him to Mount [[Moriah]]. At God's command, Abraham was to build a sacrificial altar and sacrifice his son Isaac upon it. After he had bound his son to the altar and drawn his knife to kill him, at the very last moment an [[angel]] of God prevented Abraham from proceeding. Rather, he was directed to sacrifice instead a nearby ram that was stuck in thickets.

===Family life===
Before Isaac was 40 (Gen 25:20) Abraham sent [[Eliezer]], his steward, into [[Mesopotamia]] to find a wife for Isaac, from his nephew [[Bethuel]]'s family. Eliezer chose the [[Aramean]] [[Rebecca|Rebekah]] for Isaac. After many years of marriage to Isaac, Rebekah had still not given birth to a child and was believed to be barren. Isaac prayed for her and she conceived. Rebekah gave birth to twin boys, [[Esau]] and [[Jacob]]. Isaac was 60 years old when his two sons were born.&lt;ref&gt;Genesis 25:26&lt;/ref&gt; Isaac favored Esau, and Rebekah favored Jacob.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|25:20–28|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The narratives about Isaac do not mention him having concubines.&lt;ref&gt;Title= Encyclopaedia Judaica | Volume 10 pg=34&lt;/ref&gt;

===Migration===
Isaac moved to ''[[Abraham#Abram and Hagar|Beer-lahai-roi]]'' after his father died.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|25:11|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the land experienced famine, he removed to the [[Philistines|Philistine]] land of [[Gerar]] where his father once lived. This land was still under the control of [[Abimelech|King Abimelech]] as it was in the days of Abraham. Like his father, Isaac also deceived Abimelech about his wife and also got into the well business. He had gone back to all of the wells that his father dug and saw that they were all stopped up with earth. The Philistines did this after Abraham died. So, Isaac unearthed them and began to dig for more wells all the way to [[Beersheba]], where he made a pact with Abimelech, just like in the day of his father.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|26|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Giotto di Bondone 080.jpg|thumb|left|Isaac blessing his son, as painted by [[Giotto di Bondone]]]]

===Birthright===
Isaac grew old and became blind. He called his son Esau and directed him to procure some venison for him, in order to receive Isaac's blessing. While Esau was hunting, Jacob, after listening to his mother's advice, deceived his blind father by misrepresenting himself as Esau and thereby obtained his father's blessing, such that Jacob became Isaac's primary heir and Esau was left in an inferior position. According to Genesis 25:29–34, Esau had previously sold his birthright to Jacob for "bread and stew of lentils". Thereafter, Isaac sent Jacob into Mesopotamia to take a wife of his mother's brother's house. After 20 years working for his uncle [[Laban (Bible)|Laban]], Jacob returned home. He reconciled with his twin brother Esau, then he and Esau buried their father, Isaac, in Hebron after he died at the age of 180.&lt;ref name="JewishEncyclopedia"&gt;''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]'', [http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=174&amp;letter=I ''Isaac''].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|35:28–29|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family tree===

==Burial site==
According to local tradition, the graves of Isaac and [[Rebecca|Rebekah]], along with the graves of Abraham and Sarah and Jacob and [[Leah]], are in the [[Cave of the Patriarchs]].

==Jewish views==
In [[Rabbinic literature|rabbinical tradition]], the age of Isaac at the time of binding is taken to be 37, which contrasts with common portrayals of Isaac as a child.&lt;ref name="New EoJ"&gt;''The New Encyclopedia of Judaism'', ''Isaac''.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[rabbi]]s also thought that the reason for the death of Sarah was the news of the intended sacrifice of Isaac.&lt;ref name="New EoJ"/&gt; The sacrifice of Isaac is cited in appeals for the [[Atonement in Judaism|mercy of God]] in later [[Judaism|Jewish]] traditions.&lt;ref name="Britannica-Isaac"&gt;''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', ''Isaac''.&lt;/ref&gt; The post-biblical Jewish interpretations often elaborate the role of Isaac beyond the biblical description and primarily focus on Abraham's intended sacrifice of Isaac, called the ''aqedah'' ("binding").&lt;ref name="EoR-Isaac"/&gt; According to a version of these interpretations, Isaac died in the sacrifice and was revived.&lt;ref name="EoR-Isaac"/&gt; According to many accounts of [[Aggadah]], unlike the Bible, it is [[Satan]] who is testing Isaac as an agent of [[God in Judaism|God]].&lt;ref name="Brill's New Pauly"&gt;Brock, Sebastian P., ''Brill's New Pauly'', ''Isaac''.&lt;/ref&gt; Isaac's willingness to follow God's command at the cost of his death has been a model for many Jews who preferred [[martyr]]dom to violation of the [[halakha|Jewish law]].&lt;ref name="New EoJ"/&gt;

According to the Jewish tradition, Isaac instituted the afternoon prayer. This tradition is based on Genesis chapter 24, verse 63&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|24:63|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; ("Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide").&lt;ref name="New EoJ"/&gt;

Isaac was the only [[patriarch]] who stayed in Canaan during his whole life and though once he tried to leave, God told him not to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|26:2|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbinic tradition gave the explanation that Isaac was almost sacrificed and anything dedicated as a sacrifice may not leave the [[Land of Israel]].&lt;ref name="New EoJ"/&gt; Isaac was the oldest of the biblical patriarchs at the time of his death, and the only patriarch whose name was not changed.&lt;ref name="EoR-Isaac"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Easton"&gt;Easton, M. G., ''Illustrated Bible Dictionary'', 3rd ed., ''Isaac''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbinic literature also linked Isaac's blindness in old age, as stated in the Bible, to the sacrificial binding: Isaac's eyes went blind because the tears of angels present at the time of his sacrifice fell on Isaac's eyes.&lt;ref name="Brill's New Pauly"/&gt;

==Christian views==
[[File:AbrahamIsaac.jpg|thumb|Isaac embraces his father Abraham after the [[Binding of Isaac]], early 1900s Bible illustration]]
The [[Early Christianity|early Christian church]] continued and developed the New Testament theme of Isaac as a type of Christ and the Church being both "the son of the promise" and the "father of the faithful".  [[Tertullian]] draws a parallel between Isaac's bearing the wood for the sacrificial fire with Christ's carrying his cross.&lt;ref&gt;Cross and Livingstone, ''Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church'', 1974, art '''Isaac'''&lt;/ref&gt; and there was a general agreement that, while all the sacrifices of the Old Law were anticipations of that on Calvary, the sacrifice of Isaac was so "in a pre-eminent way".&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, J.N.D. ''Early Christian Doctrines'', A &amp; C Black, 1965. p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and the Roman Catholic Church consider Isaac as a Saint along with other [[biblical patriarchs]].&lt;ref&gt;''The patriarchs, prophets and certain other Old Testament figures have been and always will be honored as saints in all the Church's liturgical traditions.'' – Catechism of the Catholic Church 61&lt;/ref&gt; Along with those of other patriarchs and the Old Testament Righteous, his feast day is celebrated in the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Byzantine rite of the Catholic Church on the Second Sunday before Christmas (December 11–17), under the title ''the Sunday of the Forefathers''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://orthodoxwiki.org/Sunday_of_the_Forefathers | title=Sunday of the Forefathers - OrthodoxWiki}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metropolitancantorinstitute.org/liturgy/Christmas_Fast.html Liturgy &gt; Liturgical year &gt;The Christmas Fast] – Byzantine Catholic Archeparchy of Pittsburgh&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Testament===
The [[New Testament]] states Isaac was "offered up" by his father Abraham, and that Isaac blessed his sons.&lt;ref name="Easton"/&gt; Paul contrasted Isaac, symbolizing [[Adiaphora#Adiaphora in Christianity|Christian liberty]], with the rejected older son Ishmael, symbolizing slavery;&lt;ref name="EoR-Isaac"&gt;''Encyclopedia of Religion'', ''Isaac''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Galatians|4:21–31|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hagar is associated with the [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]] covenant, while Sarah is associated with the covenant of grace, into which her son Isaac enters. The [[Epistle of James]] chapter 2, verses 21–24,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||James|2:21–24|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; states that the sacrifice of Isaac shows that justification (in the Johannine sense) requires both faith and works.&lt;ref name="EoC-Isaac"&gt;''Encyclopedia of Christianity'', Bowden, John, ed., ''Isaac''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Epistle to the Hebrews]], Abraham's willingness to follow God's command to sacrifice Isaac is used as an example of faith as is Isaac's action in blessing Jacob and Esau with reference to the future promised by God to Abraham&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|Hebrews|11:17–20|ASV}}&lt;/ref&gt; In verse 19, the author views the release of Isaac from sacrifice as analogous to the [[resurrection of Jesus]], the idea of the sacrifice of Isaac being a prefigure of the sacrifice of Jesus on the [[Christian cross|cross]].&lt;ref&gt;see F.F. Bruce, ''The Epistle to the Hebrews'' Marshall. Morgan and Scott, 1964 pp. 308–13 for all this paragraph.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islamic views==
{{Main article|Isaac in Islam}}
[[File:Grave Ishaq.JPG|thumbnail|''[[Cave of the Patriarchs]]'', [[Hebron]]]]
[[Islam]] considers Isaac a [[Prophets of Islam|prophet of Islam]], and describes him as the father of the [[Israelites]] and a righteous [[servant of God]].

Isaac, along with [[Ishmael]], is highly important for Muslims for continuing to preach the message of [[monotheism]] after his father [[Abraham]]. Among Isaac's children was the follow-up Israelite patriarch [[Jacob]], who too is venerated an Islamic prophet.

Isaac is mentioned fifteen times by name in the [[Quran]], often with his father and his son, [[Jacob]].&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Islam'', W. Montgomery Watt, ''Isaac''&lt;/ref&gt; The Quran states that Abraham received "good tidings of Isaac, a prophet, of the righteous", and that God blessed them both (37: 112). In a fuller description, when [[angel]]s came to [[Abraham]] to tell him of the future punishment to be imposed on [[Sodom and Gomorrah]], his wife, [[Sarah]], "laughed, and We gave her good tidings of Isaac, and after Isaac of (a grandson) Jacob" (11: 71–74); and it is further explained that this event will take place despite Abraham and Sarah's old age. Several verses speak of Isaac as a "gift" to Abraham (6: 84; 14: 49–50), and 24: 26–27 adds that [[God]] made "prophethood and the Book to be among his offspring", which has been interpreted to refer to Abraham's two prophetic sons, his prophetic grandson [[Jacob]], and his prophetic great-grandson [[Joseph in Islam|Joseph]]. In the [[Qur'an]], it later narrates that Abraham also praised [[God]] for giving him Ishmael and Isaac in his old age (14: 39–41).

Elsewhere in the Quran, Isaac is mentioned in lists: Joseph follows the religion of his forefathers Abraham, Isaac and Jacob (12: 38) and speaks of [[God]]'s favor to them (12: 6); [[Jacob]]'s sons all testify their faith and promise to worship the [[God]] that their forefathers, "Abraham, Ishmael and Isaac", worshiped (2: 127); and the Qur'an commands [[Muslim]]s to believe in the revelations that were given to "Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob and the Patriarchs" (2: 136; 3: 84). In the Quran's narrative of Abraham's near-sacrifice of his son (37: 102), the name of the son is not mentioned and debate has continued over the son's identity, though many feel that the identity is the least important element in a story which is given to show the courage that one develops through faith.&lt;ref&gt;''Concise Encyclopedia of Islam'', C. Glasse, ''Isaac''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quran===
The Quran mentions Isaac as a prophet and a righteous man of [[God in Islam|God]]. Isaac and Jacob are mentioned as being bestowed upon Abraham as gifts of God, who then worshipped God only and were righteous leaders in the way of God:
{{Quote|And We bestowed on him Isaac and, as an additional gift, (a grandson), Jacob, and We made righteous men of every one (of them).&lt;br&gt;And We made them leaders, guiding (men) by Our Command, and We sent them inspiration to do good deeds, to establish regular prayers, and to practise regular charity; and they constantly served Us (and Us only).|Quran, [[sura]] 21 ([[Al-Anbiya]]), [[ayah]] 72–73&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|21|72|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Quote|And WE gave him the glad tidings of Isaac, a Prophet, and one of the righteous.|Quran, [[sura]] 37 ([[As-Saaffat]]), [[ayah]] 112&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|37|112|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Academic==
Some scholars have described Isaac as "a [[legend]]ary figure" or "as a figure representing [[tribe|tribal]] history, or "as a [[nomad|seminomadic]] leader."&lt;ref name="EoC1-Isaac"&gt;''Eerdmans Encyclopedia of Christianity'', ''Isaac'', p. 744.&lt;/ref&gt; The stories of Isaac, like other patriarchal stories of Genesis, are generally believed to have "their origin in folk memories and oral traditions of the early Hebrew [[Pastoralism|pastoralist]] experience."&lt;ref name="EoCol-Isaac"&gt;''[[Columbia Encyclopedia]]'', ''Isaac''.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Cambridge Companion to the Bible'' makes the following comment on the biblical stories of the patriarchs:

{{Quote|Yet for all that these stories maintain a distance between their world and that of their time of literary growth and composition, they reflect the political realities of the later periods. Many of the narratives deal with the relationship between the ancestors and peoples who were part of Israel's political world at the time the stories began to be written down (eighth century B.C.E.). Lot is the ancestor of the Transjordanian peoples of Ammon and Moab, and Ishmael personifies the nomadic peoples known to have inhabited north Arabia, although located in the Old Testament in the Negev. Esau personifies Edom (36:1), and Laban represents the Aramean states to Israel's north. A persistent theme is that of difference between the ancestors and the indigenous Canaanites… In fact, the theme of the differences between Judah and Israel, as personified by the ancestors, and the neighboring peoples of the time of the monarchy is pressed effectively into theological service to articulate the choosing by God of Judah and Israel to bring blessing to all peoples."&lt;ref&gt;''The Cambridge Companion to the Bible'', p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to [[Martin Noth]], a scholar of the Hebrew Bible, the narratives of Isaac date back to an older cultural stage than that of the West-Jordanian Jacob.&lt;ref name="EoC1-Isaac"/&gt; At that era, the [[Israelite]] tribes were not yet sedentary. In the course of looking for grazing areas, they had come in contact in southern [[Philistia]] with the inhabitants of the settled countryside.&lt;ref name="EoC1-Isaac"/&gt; The biblical historian A. Jopsen believes in the connection between the Isaac traditions and the north, and in support of this theory adduces [[Book of Amos|Amos]] 7:9 ("the high places of Isaac").&lt;ref name="EoC1-Isaac"/&gt;

[[Albrecht Alt]] and Martin Noth hold that, "The figure of Isaac was enhanced when the theme of promise, previously bound to the cults of the 'God the Fathers' was incorporated into the Israelite creed during the southern-Palestinian stage of the growth of the [[Torah|Pentateuch]] tradition."&lt;ref name="EoC1-Isaac"/&gt; According to Martin Noth, at the Southern Palestinian stage of the growth of the Pentateuch tradition, Isaac became established as one of the biblical patriarchs, but his traditions were receded in the favor of Abraham.&lt;ref name="EoC1-Isaac"/&gt;

==In art==
The earliest Christian portrayal of Isaac is found in the [[Catacombs of Rome|Roman catacomb]] [[fresco]]es.&lt;ref name="Early Christian Art"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Smith, Alison Moore|title=The Iconography of the Sacrifice of Isaac in Early Christian Art|jstor=497708|journal=American Journal of Archaeology|volume=26|issue=2|pages=159–73|doi=10.2307/497708|year=1922}}&lt;/ref&gt; Excluding the fragments, Alison Moore Smith classifies these artistic works in three categories:

{{Quote|Abraham leads Isaac towards the altar; or Isaac approaches with the bundle of sticks, Abraham having preceded him to the place of offering .... Abraham is upon a pedestal and Isaac stands near at hand, both figures in orant [[attitude (art)|attitude]] .... Abraham is shown about to sacrifice Isaac while the latter stands or kneels on the ground beside the altar. Sometimes Abraham grasps Isaac by the hair. Occasionally the ram is added to the scene and in the later paintings the [[Hand of God (art)|Hand of God]] emerges from above.&lt;ref name="Early Christian Art"/&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5104">{{infobox person/Wikidata|fetchwikidata=ALL}}'''James Bertram''' (1872–1934) was the personal secretary of [[Andrew Carnegie]], the industrialist and philanthropist, from 1897-1914. Bertram also served the [[Carnegie Corporation of New York]] from its inception in 1911 as secretary and trustee until his death in 1934. He thus continued to have an important role in Carnegie's philanthropic projects after Carnegie's death in 1919.&lt;ref name="Carnegie"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.library.cmu.edu:7850/Research/Archives/UnivArchives/BertramAid.html |title=James Bertram Collection |first=Jennie |last=Benford |publisher=[[Carnegie Mellon Libraries]] |date=2004-11-16 |accessdate=2010-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Bertram was born in [[Corstorphine]], near [[Edinburgh]], the Scottish capital where was educated at [[Daniel Stewart's College]].&lt;ref name="Carnegie"/&gt;  His first position was with the [[Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)|Great Northern and Northeastern Railway]] company in Edinburgh. He emigrated to South Africa, where he continued to work in the railway industry. He returned to Scotland for health reasons in 1897, and was recruited by Andrew Carnegie, who had recently acquired a Scottish home, [[Skibo Castle]].

==Activities in the United States==
In the US Bertram by 1908 supervised Carnegie's library program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ellen Condliffe Lagemann|title=The Politics of Knowledge: The Carnegie Corporation, Philanthropy, and Public Policy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s0AalQle34cC&amp;pg=PA17|year=1992|publisher=U of Chicago Press|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He took a close interest in the new [[Carnegie library|Carnegie libraries]], commenting on the [[architectural plan]]s submitted by applicants.  Bertram's interventions discouraged extravagant architectural features and encouraged adherence to published guidelines. 

The Carnegie Libraries in Iowa Project notes that Bertram was empowered by Andrew Carnegie to carry on negotiations, answer questions, and oversee contractual arrangements. The Carnegie Libraries in Iowa Project further asserts that Bertram, and not Carnegie, was the one who established the eligibility requirements for a community to receive funding. While he did not exhibit much of a fluid or articulate communication style -- leaving his letters, notes, responses, etc. more confused and misinformed than enlightened by his instructions, Bertram considered the power Carnegie entrusted to him as a kind of sacred trust demanding his protection. Therefore, Bertram established the primary requirements that the community population should be sufficiently large to support the library. He also determined, as time went on, that beautiful architectural enhancements that adorned the library buildings – domes, marble staircases, statues -- had to be eliminated in order to cut down on costs and to improve the libraries functionality and working space for library services. He began a campaign of informing inquiring groups with pamphlets on the need for practicality of design so that the grant amount would cover the construction costs to make it ready for immediate occupancy and fulfillment of its purpose. Bertram's rigorous guardianship of the Carnegie trust had the immediate effect he desired; however, it also caused substantial difficulties for some Iowa communities seeking to build libraries with Carnegie funding. It was these stipulations that [[Alice S. Tyler]] quietly but strongly objected to during her time as Secretary, seeking to have them removed and encouraging Iowa communities to pursue local financial support and reject the Carnegie funds. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dsps.lib.uiowa.edu/clip/andrew-carnegie-james-bertram/|title=Andrew Carnegie &amp; James Bertram – Carnegie Libraries in Iowa Project|website=dsps.lib.uiowa.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Bertram authored ''Notes on Library Buildings'', a work which included complete plans, in 1910.&lt;ref name="Mohney"&gt;{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=88003017}}|title=National Register of Historic Places Registration: Milo Public Library|publisher=[[National Park Service]]|author=Kirk F.

'''Jeanne de Bellem''' or '''Jeanne Pinaut''' (1 March 1734 – [[Floruit|fl]]. 1793), was a politically active Belgian [[pamphlet]] writer and a participator of the [[Brabant revolution]] of 1789. She had a long-term relationship with the revolutionary leader [[Henri Van der Noot]] and exerted a great deal of political influence upon the rule within the [[United States of Belgium]] 1789–1790.

== Biography ==

Jeanne de Bellem was born in poverty but was given a good education. She arrived in [[Brussels]] in 1750, where she worked as a domestic and a prostitute and became known for being the mistress of many notables, such as the general governor Ollivier and vicomte de Quenonville, and had a daughter [[Marianne de Bellem]], by an unknown father. In parallel, she had a serious and lifelong relationship with Henri Van der Noot.

From 1787, Bellem was a well-known writer of political pamphlets, which encouraged the Belgians to follow the example of America and rise in rebellion toward Austria; she wrote the famous revolutionary poem: "Peuple Belgique/cour tyrannique/faisons commet l'Amerique". She was also politically active as the intermediary of Van der Noot, who spoke to the Belgian estates and maintained contact with them with her as messenger, as they did not dare to speak to Van der Noot directly. In 1788, during Noot's absence in [[London]], she was arrested for her political activity and put on trial. The trial aroused great attention, but ended with her release after her public apology. She was arrested again in 1789 but was released shortly before the revolution, and gained troops for the rebellion. The 18 December 1789, Jeanne de Bellem participated in the entrance of Henri Van der Noot in Brussels in the carriage by his side and attended the theatre by his side.

The involvement of Jeanne de Bellem in the state affairs of the republic was controversial and she was the target of a lot of abusive caricatures by the opposition who used her as a way of criticizing Van der Noot and the government. She was called Noots official mistress, was said to encourage her lovers to attack the democrats in a contra-revolutionary coup, and when Van der Noot took the title of Duke, she was said to long for the title of Duchess. In parallel to the slander, however, she also received a great deal of praise and admiration. It was said that Jeanne de Bellem, Henri Van der Noot and their (male) colleague Eupen lived in a [[menage-a-trois]]. Bellem was also in charge of the pamphlets issued by the state.

Upon the return of the Austrians and the death of the republic in 1790, Jeanne de Bellem was separated from Van der Noot and fled with her daughter Marianne to [[Breda]] in the [[Netherlands]].

'''Kevin Schon''' (born February 7, 1958) is an [[Americans|American]] actor, voice actor, producer and energy entrepreneur, who is known for his voice-over work in video games, movies and TV shows. He is best known for voicing Timon in the ''[[Timon &amp; Pumbaa]]'' TV series in Season 2 and in various other [[Disney]] related projects.

==Career==
Voice-over was his second career, begun in 1992 in [[Los Angeles]], after 10 years as a Senior Advisory Systems Engineer for [[IBM]], where he developed and taught Design Theory to IBM field engineers.  He spent his last three years with IBM living in [[Tokyo]], returning to the United States in 1990, where he left the company and began studying acting with [[Ivana Chubbuck]] and voice-over with [[Susan Blu]].

For many years, he was [[Nathan Lane]]'s voice double, taking over the role of [[Timon and Pumbaa|Timon]] in ''[[Timon &amp; Pumbaa (TV series)|The Lion King's Timon and Pumbaa]]'' and singing the title song as well. He appeared in over 120 episodes of that series. He reprised the role of Timon in ''The Lion Guard'' and ''House of Mouse''. He worked on the ground-breaking animated series ''[[Teacher's Pet (TV series)|Teacher's Pet]]'' created by renowned artist and cartoonist Gary Baseman, playing the roles of Spot and Scott, originated by Emmy winner Nathan Lane.  In addition, he is known by cartoon "cultists" everywhere for his work on ''[[Tick (comics)|The Tick]]'' - voicing both villains and superheroes. Schon also voiced Snowbell in ''[[Stuart Little: The Animated Series]]'' and ''[[Stuart Little 3: Call of the Wild]]'', once again replacing Nathan Lane. For 3 years, he was the "comedy voice" of the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television network, voicing all promos for their comedies (''[[Home Improvement (TV series)|Home Improvement]]'', ''[[The Drew Carey Show|Drew Carey]]'', ''[[Roseanne (TV series)|Roseanne]]'', and ''[[Ellen (TV series)|Ellen]]'', among others) and was the promo voice for ''[[Politically Incorrect]]'' when it moved from cable to ABC. Kevin's voice appears in over 40 episodes of ''[[Married... with Children]]'', with two on-camera appearances. He is also voiced Lob-Star in ''Skylanders; Trap Team'' and ''Skylanders; SuperChargers'', Otto in ''Ben 10: Omniverse'', Activist in ''Infamous Second Son'', Officer What in ''Jack and the Beanstalk'', Roboy in ''Bubble Guppies'', Onyx in ''Sofia the First'', Dead-Eye in ''Jumanji'', Male Patron and Male #2 in ''The Angry Beavers'', Announcer and Weatherman in ''Rugrats'', Velocirraptor, Peasant, Waiter and Reporter in ''I Am Weasel'', Conductor and Hyena in ''Cow and Chicken'', Thrakhath and Blizzard in ''Wing Commander Academy'', Major Taibot, Abomination, Judge, Samual Laroquette and Zzzax in ''The Incredible Hulk'', Stash in ''The Nuttiest Nutcracker'', Muc, Luc, Wolverine 1 and Simpson in the ''Balto'' franchise, Pongo in ''101 Dalmatians: The Series'', Grimskull and Prince Joshua in ''Skeleton Warriors'', Merdude and Alim Coelacanth in ''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'', Narrator in ''State to State'', Chungu and Chunga in ''The Lion Guard'', Elderly Peter Pan and In in ''Disney's Villains' Revenge'', Happy in ''House of Mouse'', Vega and UAC Soldier in the 2016 video game ''Doom'' and provided additional voices for ''Battlefield: Hardline'', ''Ben 10: Omniverse'', ''Family Dog'', ''Invasion America'', ''Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic'', ''Doom,'' and ''The Twisted Tales of Felix the Cat''.

He is also played Frank II and Mirabelle in The Naked Truth and Daryl O'Melveny in A Kiss Goodnight,

In 1999, he help financed the start-up of Ask Jeeves (now [[Ask.com]]), then went into semi-retirement when the company's IPO skyrocketed (this was at the beginning of the Internet "bubble") and moved with his wife (actor, writer, and filmmaker Suzanne Dudley Schon) and children from California to [[New Hampshire]]. In 2002, the couple purchased a house in [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]], the lengthy New Hampshire winters having produced symptoms of depression. In late 2003, he produced ''More'', an autobiographical one-woman show written and performed by [[Yeardley Smith]] (voice of Lisa on ''[[The Simpsons]]''), at the Union Square Theatre in New York City.  The show was critically acclaimed, but financially unsuccessful.

He was co-producer of ''[[Bat Boy: The Musical]]'' in the [[United Kingdom]], first in a limited run in [[Leeds]], then in a full-scale [[West End theatre|West End]] production at the [[Shaftesbury Theatre]] in [[London]]. Even though most press reviews were scathing, one notable exception - The ''Evening Standard'' - took up the cause for what became a groundbreaking cult classic which is now one of the most often-produced musicals in America. Film director [[John Landis]] was brought in to see the West End production and enthusiastically signed on to direct a film version. Though a film screenplay was written by the original authors under the guidance of Mr. Landis, the producers lost the rights to the property, the authors proved recalcitrant, vindictive and uncooperative, and the film remains unproduced.

The strain on Schon's marriage created, in part, by his extensive absences from his family, and the loss of several million dollars of his personal fortune in trying to keep his projects afloat led to the inevitable breakdown and ultimate breakup of his marriage. He and his wife divorced in October 2006.

Schon became interested in energy healing, holistic, and alternative medicine and metaphysical phenomena in late 2007. He began an in-depth study of various alternative and complementary medicine techniques (CAM) - including Zero Balancing, Crystal Therapy, and Reiki. Under the tutelage of Master Teachers John Harvey Gray and Lourdes Gray (Gray is one of the original 22 Western Reiki Master teachers trained by Hawayo Takata, who brought Reiki to the Western world from its original home in Japan), he attained the level of Reiki Master Practitioner in December 2009. He also became a serious collector and distributor of crystals and minerals and operates a private consulting practice which incorporates his various interests and life experiences.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16216">'''King Arthur's family''' grew throughout the centuries with [[King Arthur]]'s legend. Several of the legendary members of this mythical king's family became leading characters of mythical tales in their own right.

==In medieval Welsh literature==
[[File:Uther Pendragon by W. H. Margetson.png|thumb|upright|''Uther Pendragon'' by [[William Henry Margetson|W. H. Margetson]] (1914)]]

In Welsh Arthurian literature from before the time of [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' (''History of the Kings of Britain''), Arthur was granted numerous relations and family members. Several early Welsh sources are usually taken as indicative of [[Uther Pendragon]] being known as Arthur's father before Geoffrey wrote, with Arthur also being granted a brother ([[Madoc ap Uthyr|Madog]]) and a nephew ([[Eliwlod]]) in these texts.&lt;ref&gt;T. Green, ''Concepts of Arthur'' (Stroud: Tempus, 2007), pp.145–51; P. Sims-Williams, "The Early Welsh Arthurian Poems" in R. Bromwich, A.O.H. Jarman and B.F. Roberts (edd.) ''The Arthur of the Welsh'' (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 1991), pp.33–71 at pp.53-4&lt;/ref&gt; Arthur also appears to have been assigned a sister in this material – [[Gawain|Gwalchmei]] is named as his sister-son (nephew) in ''[[Culhwch and Olwen]]'', his mother being one Gwyar.&lt;ref&gt;R. Bromwich, ''Trioedd Ynys Prydein: the Welsh Triads'' (Cardiff: University of Wales, 1978), pp.372–3&lt;/ref&gt; ''Culhwch and Olwen'', the ''Vita Iltuti'' and the ''[[Brut Dingestow]]'' combine to suggest that Arthur had a mother too, named [[Igraine|Eigyr]].&lt;ref&gt;R. Bromwich and D. Simon Evans, ''Culhwch and Olwen. An Edition and Study of the Oldest Arthurian Tale'' (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 1992), pp.44-5&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to this immediate family, Arthur was said to have had a great variety of more distant relatives, including maternal aunts, uncles, cousins and a grandfather named [[Amlawdd Wledig|Anlawd (or Amlawdd) Wledig]] ("Prince Anlawd"). The latter is the common link between many of these figures and Arthur: thus the relationship of first cousins that is implied or stated between Arthur, [[Culhwch]], [[Illtud]], and Goreu mab Custenhin depends upon all of their mothers being daughters of this Anlawd, who appears to be ultimately a genealogical construct designed to allow such inter-relationships between characters to be postulated by medieval Welsh authors.&lt;ref&gt;R. Bromwich and D. Simon Evans, ''Culhwch and Olwen. An Edition and Study of the Oldest Arthurian Tale'' (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 1992), pp.44-5&lt;/ref&gt; Arthur's maternal uncles in ''Culhwch and Olwen'', including Llygatrud Emys, Gwrbothu Hen, Gweir Gwrhyt Ennwir and Gweir Baladir Hir, similarly appear to derive from this relationship.&lt;ref&gt;These maternal uncles are named at lines 251-2, 288-90: R. Bromwich and D. Simon Evans, ''Culhwch and Olwen. An Edition and Study of the Oldest Arthurian Tale'' (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

The genealogies from the 13th-century Mostyn MS. 117 assert that Arthur is the son of [[Uther Pendragon|Uthyr]], the son of Custennin, the son of Cynfawr, the son of Tudwal, the son of Morfawr, the son of Eudaf, the son of Cadwr the son of Cynan, the son of [[Caradog ap Bran|Caradoc]], the son of [[Bran the Blessed|Bran]], the son of [[Llŷr]].

Regarding Arthur's own family, his wife is consistently stated to be [[Guinevere|Gwenhwyfar]], usually the daughter of King [[Leodegrance|Ogrfan Gawr]] (variation: 'Gogrfan Gawr', "[G]Ogrfan the Giant") and sister to [[Gwenhwyach]], although ''Culhwch'' and ''Bonedd yr Arwyr'' do indicate that Arthur also had some sort of relationship with Eleirch daughter of Iaen, which produced a son named Kyduan (Cydfan).&lt;ref&gt;See T. Green, ''Concepts of Arthur'' (Stroud: Tempus, 2007), pp.151–5; R. Bromwich and D. Simon Evans, ''Culhwch and Olwen. An Edition and Study of the Oldest Arthurian Tale'' (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 1992), pp.76–7, 107-08 -- the latter note that the sons of Iaen appear to have been kinsmen of Arthur on ''their'' father's side, not Arthur's father's side, i.e. they were Arthur's in-laws via their sister&lt;/ref&gt; Kyduan was not the only child of Arthur according to Welsh Arthurian tradition – he is also ascribed sons called Amr (Anir),&lt;ref&gt;''Historia Brittonum'', [[s:History of the Britons#Arthuriana|73]] and also the romance ''[[Geraint and Enid]]'', which mentions an "Amhar son of Arthur"&lt;/ref&gt; Gwydre,&lt;ref&gt;R. Bromwich and D. Simon Evans, ''Culhwch and Olwen. An Edition and Study of the Oldest Arthurian Tale'' (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 1992), lines 1116-7&lt;/ref&gt; Llacheu&lt;ref&gt;R. Bromwich, ''Trioedd Ynys Prydein: the Welsh Triads'' (Cardiff: University of Wales, 1978), pp.416–8&lt;/ref&gt; and Duran.&lt;ref&gt;J. Rowland, ''Early Welsh Saga Poetry: a Study and Edition of the Englynion'' (Cambridge, 1990), pp.250–1&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other medieval literature==
[[File:Guinever by W. H. Margetson.png|left|thumb|upright|''Guinevere'' by W. H. Margetson (1914)]]

Relatively few members of Arthur's family in the Welsh materials are carried over to the works of Geoffrey and the [[Chivalric romance|chivalric romancers]]. His grandfather Anlawd Wledic and his maternal uncles, aunts and cousins do not appear there, and neither do any of his sons or his paternal relatives. Only the core family seem to have made the journey: his wife Gwenhwyfar (who became [[Guinevere]]), his father [[Uther]], his mother ([[Igerna]]) and his sister-son Gwalchmei ([[Gawain]]). Gwalchmei's mother – Arthur's sister – failed to make the journey, Gwyar's place being taken by Anna, the wife of [[King Lot|Loth]], in Geoffrey's account, whilst Medraut ([[Mordred]]) is made into a second sister-son for Arthur (a status he does not have in the Welsh material).&lt;ref&gt;B. F. Roberts, "Geoffrey of Monmouth, ''Historia Regum Britanniae'' and ''Brut Y Brenhinedd''" in R. Bromwich, A. O. H. Jarman and B. F. Roberts (edd.) ''The Arthur of the Welsh'' (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 1991), pp.98–116 at pp.112–3&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Morgan le Fay by W. H. Margetson.jpg|thumb|upright|''Morgan le Fay'' by W. H. Margetson (1914)]]

In addition, new family members enter the Arthurian tradition from this point onwards. Uther is given a new family, including two brothers and a father,&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey of Monmouth, ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' [[s:History of the Kings of Britain/Book 8#1|Book 8.1]]&lt;/ref&gt; while Arthur gains a sister, [[Morgan le Fay]] (first named as Arthur's sister by [[Chrétien de Troyes]]),&lt;ref&gt;''Arthurian Romances'' trans. W. Kibler and C. W. Carroll (Harmondsworth, Penguin, 1991)&lt;/ref&gt; and a new son, Loholt, in Chrétien's ''Eric and Enide'', the ''[[Perlesvaus]]'' and the [[Lancelot-Grail|Vulgate Cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;''Arthurian Romances'' trans. W. Kibler and C. W. Carroll (Harmondsworth, Penguin, 1991); ''The High Book of the Grail: A translation of the thirteenth century romance of Perlesvaus'' trans. N. Bryant (Brewer, 1996); ''Lancelot-Grail: The Old French Arthurian Vulgate and Post-Vulgate in Translation'' trans. N. J. Lacy (New York: Garland, 1992-6), 5 vols.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another significant new family-member is Arthur's half-sister [[Morgause]], the daughter of Gorlois and Igerna and mother of Gawain and Mordred in the French romances (replacing Geoffrey of Monmouth's Anna in this role). In the Vulgate ''Mort Artu'' we find [[Mordred]]'s relationship with Arthur once more reinterpreted, as he is made the issue of an unwitting incestuous liaison between Arthur and this Morgause, with Arthur dreaming that Mordred would grow up to kill him.&lt;ref&gt;''Lancelot-Grail: The Old French Arthurian Vulgate and Post-Vulgate in Translation'' trans. N. J. Lacy (New York: Garland, 1992-6), 5 vols.&lt;/ref&gt; This tale is preserved in all the romances based on the ''Mort Artu'', and by the time of Malory's ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'' Arthur has started to plot, [[Herod the Great|Herod]]-like, to kill all children born on the same day as Mordred in order to save himself from this fate.&lt;ref&gt;See A. Varin, "Mordred, King Arthur's Son" in ''Folklore'' 90 (1979), pp.167–77 on Mordred's birth, its origins and Arthur's reaction to his dream.&lt;/ref&gt; A third half-sister, [[Elaine (legend)#Elaine of Garlot|Elaine]], is also added at this time. Through his sisters, Arthur is given further nephews ([[Gareth]], [[Gaheris]], [[Agravain]], [[Ywain]], and [[Galeschin]]) who become Knights of the [[Round Table]]. {{clear left}}

==Descendants==
Although Arthur is given sons in both early and late Arthurian tales, he is rarely granted significant further generations of descendants; this is at least partly because of the premature deaths of his sons in these legends. Amr is the first to be mentioned in Arthurian literature, appearing in the 9th-century ''[[History of the Britons|Historia Brittonum]]'':

:"There is another wonder in the region which is called Ercing. A tomb is located there next to a spring which is called Licat Amr; and the name of the man who is buried in the tomb was called thus: Amr. He was the son of Arthur the soldier, and Arthur himself killed and buried him in that very place. And men come to measure the grave and find it sometimes six feet in length, sometimes nine, sometimes twelve, sometimes fifteen. At whatever length you might measure it at one time, a second time you will not find it to have the same length – and I myself have put this to the test."&lt;ref&gt;''Historia Brittonum'', [[s:History of the Britons#Arthuriana|73]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Why Arthur chose to kill his son is never made clear. The only other reference to Amr comes in the post-Galfridian Welsh romance ''[[Geraint and Enid|Geraint]]'', where "Amhar son of Arthur" is one of Arthur’s four chamberlains along with [[Bedivere|Bedwyr]]'s son Amhren.&lt;ref&gt;T. Jones and G. Jones, ''The Mabinogion'' (London: Dent, 1949), p.231&lt;/ref&gt; Gwydre is similarly unlucky, being slaughtered by the giant boar [[Twrch Trwyth]] in ''Culhwch and Olwen'', along with two of Arthur's maternal uncles – no other references to either Gwydre or Arthur's uncles survive.&lt;ref&gt;R. Bromwich and D. Simon Evans, ''Culhwch and Olwen. An Edition and Study of the Oldest Arthurian Tale'' (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 1992), lines 1116–7 and note on Gwydre; T. Jones and G. Jones, ''The Mabinogion'' (London: Dent, 1949), pp.132, 134&lt;/ref&gt;

More is known of Arthur's son Llacheu. He is one of the "Three Well-Endowed Men of the Island of Britain", according to the [[Welsh Triads|Triad]] 4, and he fights alongside [[Sir Kay|Cei]] in the early Arthurian poem ''[[Pa gur|Pa gur yv y porthaur?]]''.&lt;ref&gt;R. Bromwich, ''Trioedd Ynys Prydein: the Welsh Triads'' (Cardiff: University of Wales, 1978), no. 4; P. Sims-Williams, "The Early Welsh Arthurian Poems" in R. Bromwich, A.O.H. Jarman and B.F. Roberts (edd.) ''The Arthur of the Welsh'' (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 1991), pp.33–71 at p.43&lt;/ref&gt; Like his father is in ''[[Y Gododdin]]'', Llacheu appears in the 12th-century and later Welsh poetry as a standard of heroic comparison and he also seems to have been similarly a figure of local topographic folklore too.&lt;ref&gt;[[O. J. Padel]], ''Arthur in Medieval Welsh Literature'' (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 2000), pp.55–6, 99; P. Sims-Williams, "The Early Welsh Arthurian Poems" in R. Bromwich, A.O.H. Jarman and B.F. Roberts (edd.) ''The Arthur of the Welsh'' (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 1991), pp.33–71 at p.44&lt;/ref&gt; Taken together, it is generally agreed that all these references indicate that Llacheu was a figure of considerable importance in the early Arthurian cycle.&lt;ref&gt;T. Green, ''Concepts of Arthur'' (Stroud: Tempus, 2007), pp.168-9&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, Llacheu too dies, with the speaker in the pre-Galfridian poem ''Ymddiddan Gwayddno Garanhir ac Gwyn fab Nudd'' remembering that he had "been where Llacheu was slain / the son of Arthur, awful in songs / when ravens croaked over blood."&lt;ref&gt;J.B. Coe and S. Young, ''The Celtic Sources for the Arthurian Legend'' (Llanerch, 1995), p.125&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, Loholt is treacherously killed by [[Sir Kay]] so that the latter can take credit for the defeat of the giant Logrin in the ''[[Perlesvaus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''The High Book of the Grail: A translation of the 13th-century romance of Perlesvaus'' trans. N. Bryant (Brewer, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; Another son, known only from a possibly 15th-century Welsh text, is said to have died on the field of [[Battle of Camlann|Camlann]]:

:Sandde Bryd Angel drive the crow
:off the face of ?Duran [son of Arthur].
:Dearly and belovedly his mother raised him.
::Arthur sang it&lt;ref&gt;J. Rowland, ''Early Welsh Saga Poetry: a Study and Edition of the Englynion'' (Cambridge, 1990), pp.250-1&lt;/ref&gt;

Medraut/Mordred is an exception to this tradition of a childless death for Arthur's sons. Mordred, like Amr, is killed by Arthur – at Camlann – according to Geoffrey of Monmouth and the post-Galfridian tradition but, unlike the others, he is ascribed [[Sons of Mordred|two]] sons, both of whom rose against Arthur's successor and cousin [[Constantine III of Britain|Constantine]] with the help of the Saxons. However, in Geoffrey's ''Historia'' (when Arthur's killing of Mordred and Mordred's sons first appear), Mordred was not yet actually Arthur's son.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey of Monmouth, ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' [[s:History of the Kings of Britain/Book 11#2|Book 11.2-4]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Later literature has expanded Arthur's family further. [[Richard Johnson (16th century)|Richard Johnson]]'s 16th-century romance ''[[Tom a Lincoln]]'' adds another illegitimate son, the eponymous Tom. Through Tom, Arthur is also given grandsons referred to only as the [[Black Knight (Arthurian legend)|Black Knight]] and [[Faerie Knight]]. Other works, such as [[Henry Fielding]]'s ''[[Tom Thumb (play)|Tom Thumb]]'', [[Walter Scott]]'s ''[[The Bridal of Triermain]]'' and modern film and television adaptations of Arthurian legend, have occasionally given Arthur daughters, diverging from the earlier legends.

'''Liu Zhi''' ([[Xiao'erjing]]: {{lang|zh-Arab|ﻟِﯿَﻮْ  جِ}},  ca. 1660 – ca. 1739), or '''Liu Chih''', was a Chinese Sunni Muslim scholar and philosopher of the [[Qing dynasty]], belonging to the Huiru (Muslim) school of Neoconfucian thought.&lt;ref&gt;Friendship in Confucian Islam, Sachiko Murata&lt;/ref&gt; He was the most prominent of the Han Kitab writers who attempted to explain Muslim thought in the Chinese intellectual climate for a Hui Chinese audience, by frequently borrowing terminologies from Buddhism, Taoism and most prominently Neoconfucianism and aligning them with Islamic concepts. He was from the city of [[Nanjing]].&lt;ref&gt;See generally: [[William Chittick]] with [[Sachiko Murata]] and [[Tu Weiming]], ''The Sage Learning of Liu Zhi: Islamic Thought in Confucian Terms'' (Harvard University 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; His magnum opus, T'ien-fang hsing-li or 'Nature and Principle in the Direction of Heaven', was considered the authoritative exposition of Islamic beliefs and has been republished twenty-five times between 1760 and 1939, and is constantly referred to by Muslims writing in Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ibnarabisociety.org/articles/islamicneoconfucianism.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
In his childhood, he received instruction from his father, Liu Sanjie (劉三杰).  At the age of 12, he studied scriptures with Yuan Ruqi (袁汝契) at the Garden of Military Studies Mosque in [[Nanjing]], (which no longer exists).  At the age of 15, he began a career of study in his home: for fifteen years, he read up on Confucianism, Buddhism, Daoism and "Western Studies."  He considered [[Confucius]] and [[Mencius]] to be "Sages of the East" and [[Muhammad]] to be a "Sage of the West," and that "the teachings of the Sages of East and West, today as in ancient times, are one."  He further believed that the scriptures of [[Islam]] are also "generally similar to the intentions of [[Confucius]] and [[Mencius]]." From around the age of 30, he took up residence at the foot of Qingliangshan in [[Nanjing]], where he began to interpret and expound on the [[Islamic]] scriptures, using [[Confucian]] studies, for a period of about twenty years.  During this time, he twice brought his manuscript with him to visit and solicit advice and the opinions of both [[Muslim]]s and non-Muslims, leaving his tracks throughout [[Jiangsu]], [[Shandong]], [[Hebei]], [[Henan]], [[Anhui]], [[Zhejiang]], [[Guangdong]], and other places.  In his later years, he resided at his studio, ''Saoyelou'' ("House of Sweeping Leaves"), at Qingliangshan in [[Nanjing]].

He learned Arabic and studied both Buddhism and Daoism. He also wrote several works on Islam in 1674, 1710, and 1721.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Muslims in China|author=Paul Lunde|newspaper=SAUDI ARAMCO World|date=July–August 1985|url=http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/198504/muslims.in.china-the.history.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His writings became part of the [[Han Kitab]], a collection of literature which synthesized Islam and [[Confucianism]].

He said that Muslims were allowed to believe in the [[Mandate of Heaven]] and serve the [[Emperor]], because Allah allowed the Mandate of Heaven to exist.&lt;ref name="Masumi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science-islam.net/article.php3?id_article=676&amp;lang=fr |title=The completion of the idea of dual loyalty towards China and Islam |last=Masumi |first=Matsumoto |publisher= |accessdate=2010-06-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724054724/http://science-islam.net/article.php3?id_article=676&amp;lang=fr |archivedate=2011-07-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lucille "Lucy" van Pelt''' is a character in the syndicated [[comic strip]] ''[[:Peanuts]]'', written and drawn by [[Charles Schulz]]. She is the older sister of [[Linus van Pelt|Linus]] and [[Rerun van Pelt|Rerun]]. Lucy is characterized as a "fussbudget", crabby,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Choy|first=Penelope|title=Basic Grammar and Usage|publisher=Thomas Wadsworth|year=2005|page=160|isbn=1-4130-0892-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Umphlett|first=Wiley Lee|title=From Television to the Internet: Postmodern Visions of American Media Culture in the Twentieth Century|publisher=[[Fairleigh Dickinson University Press]]|year=2006|page=66|isbn=0-8386-4080-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; bossy and opinionated girl who bullies most other characters in the strip, particularly Linus and [[Charlie Brown]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mansour|first=David|title=From ABBA to Zoom: A Pop Culture Encyclopedia of the Late 20th&amp;nbsp;Century|publisher=[[Andrews McMeel Publishing]]|year=2005|page=281|isbn=0-7407-5118-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personality==
Lucy often mocks and intimidates others, especially [[Charlie Brown]] and her own younger brother, [[Linus van Pelt|Linus]]. She also has a strong unrequited crush on [[Schroeder (Peanuts)|Schroeder]]. She can be quite antagonistic, playing the villain role in a number of stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1965/01/07|title=Peanuts cartoon 07|date=January 1956|accessdate=December 24, 2014|website=Gocomics.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christopher Caldwell (journalist)|Christopher Caldwell]] has said about the character: "Lucy is no 'fussbudget.' She's an American nightmare, a combination of zero brains, infinite appetites and infinite self-esteem, who is (for that reason) able to run roughshod over all her playmates. At her best, she is the most terrifying character in the history of comics."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nypress.com/against-snoopy|title=Against Snoopy|date=January 4, 2000|accessdate=December 5, 2014|website = StrausMedia|publisher=Christopher Caldwell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While she often bullies and makes fun of characters like [[Charlie Brown]], he still thinks of Lucy as a good friend and deep down, Lucy does have a fondness of him, with a couple of times that she said that "he's full of surprises."

===Psychiatric booth===
Lucy also operates a [[Psychiatry|psychiatric]] booth, parodying the [[Lemonade Stand (business)|lemonade stand]] operated by many young children in the United States. Here, she offers advice and [[psychoanalysis]] for a [[nickel (United States coin)|nickel (five cents)]], usually to an anxious Charlie Brown. The "advice" is almost always worthless. However, on a few instances, Lucy’s advice may range from street-smart popular psychology, hilarious obvious truths, to somehow insightful investigation. One example is when, while treating Snoopy, Lucy asks him how he related, during his childhood, to the other (if you allow the expression) "dogs" in his family. Needless to say, Snoopy was quick to disallow the expression.

A sign on the front of the booth declares that "The Doctor is" in or out, depending on which side of the "In/Out" placard is displayed.  In ''[[A Charlie Brown Christmas]]'', Lucy reverses the placard from displaying its "Out" side to reveal the words "Real In". Another time, on the title panel of a Sunday strip, it showed Lucy chewing gum, and the sign read "The Doctor is Preoccupied."{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}{{undue weight inline|date=January 2015}}

===Baseball===
On Charlie Brown's baseball team Lucy plays right field (or occasionally center field), and is characterized as a bad player, who, when temporarily kicked off the team, turns to heckling the games. Lucy has a knack for coming up with a nonsensical excuse for every fly ball she misses, such as "The moons of Saturn got in my eyes" or "I think there were toxic substances coming from my glove, and they made me dizzy." Other times, she finds an excuse to have one-sided conversations with Charlie Brown at the pitcher's mound, often over some trivial thing she noticed, which usually result in Charlie Brown blowing his top and yelling at her to "Get back in rightfield where you belong!"{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Once, Charlie Brown berated her for letting fly balls drop, telling her he would not brook any more excuses; Lucy caught the ball cleanly, and tossed it back to him on the mound silently, after which he admitted he was actually looking forward to her next excuse. In a series of strips that later became part of the 2003 TV special ''[[Lucy Must Be Traded, Charlie Brown]]'', Charlie Brown traded Lucy to Peppermint Patty's baseball team for Marcie (and a pizza), but once Patty discovered what a terrible player Lucy really was, she traded her back. Even on the diamond, Lucy vainly flirts with [[Schroeder (Peanuts)|Schroeder]], who plays catcher on Charlie Brown's team.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}{{undue weight inline|date=January 2014}}

==History==
The third new character in ''Peanuts'' after [[Violet (Peanuts)|Violet]] and [[Schroeder (Peanuts)|Schroeder]], Lucy made her debut on March 3, 1952. She was originally a goggle-eyed toddler who continually annoys her parents and the older kids, but aged up over the next two years so that by 1954, she was the same age as Charlie Brown (the early strips with toddler-age Lucy were not reprinted until after Charles Schulz’s death). Schulz then altered Lucy's eyes to have the same appearance as that of the other characters, except for small extra lines around them which were also sported by her two siblings.

Lucy has short, black hair and wears a blue dress with blue socks and [[saddle shoes]] until the 1970s when Schulz began showing the strip's female characters in pants and shirts in order to keep their outfits more contemporary. By the late 1980s, she had switched to this look permanently.

Lucy frequently pulls the [[American football|football]] away from Charlie Brown right as he is about to kick it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Inge |first=M. Thomas |authorlink=M. Thomas Inge |title=Charles M. Schulz: Conversations |publisher=[[University Press of Mississippi]] |year=2000 |pages=89 |isbn=1-57806-305-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Grossman |first=Anna Jane |title=It's Not Me, It's You: The Ultimate Breakup Book|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=2007|page=101|isbn=0-7382-1090-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Jean|title=A Game for Rough Girls? A History of Women's Football in Britain|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2002|page=166|isbn=0-415-26337-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first occasion on which she did this was November 16, 1952 ([[Violet Gray|Violet]] unintentionally did the same thing a year before because she was afraid Charlie Brown would accidentally kick ''her''), but unlike subsequent stunts, Lucy first pulled the ball away because she did not want Charlie Brown to get it dirty (he took a second try in the same strip, only to trip over it at the end).

The football strips became an annual tradition, and Schulz did one every year for the rest of the strip's run.  One infamous example of this is the animated special ''[[It's Your First Kiss, Charlie Brown]]'', where her actions (she pulled the ball away four times) cost the school football team a win in the Homecoming game, yet Charlie Brown is blamed even though he is clearly not at fault. Charlie Brown did in fact kick the football in the September 12, 1956 strip, but only because Schroeder was holding the ball.

Lucy was named after Louanne van Pelt, a former neighbor of Charles Schulz in Colorado Springs and, according to David Michaelis of Time Magazine, was modeled after Schulz's first wife, Joyce.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title=Holiday TV: Mariemont woman inspired Lucy Van Pelt |url=http://cincinnati.com/blogs/tv/2012/12/18/holiday-tv-mariemont-woman-inspired-lucy-van-pelt/ |date=December 18, 2012 |accessdate=December 18, 2012 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121219144958/http://cincinnati.com/blogs/tv/2012/12/18/holiday-tv-mariemont-woman-inspired-lucy-van-pelt/ |archivedate=December 19, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular Culture==
* Lucy along with the other Peanuts made appearances on [[Family Guy]]. Her most recent appearance is in [[Brian's Got a Brand New Bag]]. [[Peter Griffin]] appeared in front of Lucy and fed up with her moving the football tricks on [[Charlie Brown]], roundhouse kicked her repeatedly. Lucy finally complied to his demands and let Charlie kick the football.

'''Maria "Masha" Bruskina''' ({{lang-be|Марыя Барысаўна Брускіна}} ''Marïya Barïsawna Bruskina''; {{lang-ru|Мария Борисовна Брускина}} ''Mariya Borisovna Bruskina''; 1924 &amp;ndash; 26 October 1941 in [[Minsk]]&lt;ref&gt;http://spartacus-educational.com/2WWbruskina.htm&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[History of the Jews in Belarus|Belarusian Jewish]] member of the [[Minsk]] [[Belarusian resistance during World War II|Resistance]] during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.auschwitz.dk/masha.htm&lt;/ref&gt; She volunteered as a nurse at the hospital in the Minsk Polytechnic Institute, which had been set up to care for wounded members of the [[Red Army]]. In addition to caring for the soldiers, she helped them escape by smuggling civilian clothing and false identity papers into the hospital. A patient told the Germans what Bruskina was doing, and she was arrested on October 14, 1941, by members of the [[Wehrmacht]]'s [[707th Security Division (Wehrmacht)|707th Infantry Division]] and the 2nd Schutzmannschaft Battalion,&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws.lp.findlaw.com/getcase/7th/case/973067.html USA v KAZYS CIURINSKAS]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lithuanian Auxiliary Police Battalions|Lithuanian auxiliary troops]] under the command of Major [[Antanas Impulevičius]]. After being arrested, Bruskina wrote a letter to her mother on October 20, 1941:

{{quotation|I am tormented by the thought that I have caused you great worry. Don't worry. Nothing bad has happened to me. I swear to you that you will have no further unpleasantness because of me. If you can, please send me my dress, my green blouse, and white socks. I want to be dressed decently when I leave here.}}

==Biography==
Masha Bruskin lived in Minsk with her mother, senior goods manager of the Book Trade Office of the [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic|BSSR]] State Publishing House. She studied well and read a lot. She was also a [[Vladimir Lenin All-Union Pioneer Organization|pioneer leader]] and a member of the school committee of [[Komsomol]]. in December 1938, the newspaper ''Pioneer of Belarus'' published a photograph of Masha with the caption: "Masha Bruskina - the schoolgirl of 8th grade in school  №  28, Minsk. She has only good and excellent marks in all subjects". In June 1941, Maria Bruskina graduated from Minsk secondary school № 28.

==The execution==
Local German authorities decided on a public hanging to make an example of Bruskina, along with two other members of the resistance, 16-year-old Volodia Shcherbatsevich and [[World War I]] veteran Kiril Trus. Before being hanged, she was paraded through the streets with a placard around her neck which read, in both [[German language|German]] and [[Russian language|Russian]]: "We are [[Soviet partisans|partisans]] and have shot at German troops". Members of the resistance were made to wear similar signs whether or not they had actually shot at German troops. She and her two comrades were hanged in public on Sunday, October 26, 1941, in front of Minsk Kristall, a yeast brewery and distillery plant on Nizhne-Lyahovskaya Street (15 Oktyabrskaya Street today). The Germans let the bodies hang for three days before allowing them to be cut down and buried.&lt;ref&gt;http://collections.ushmm.org/search/catalog/pa12790&lt;/ref&gt;

Pyotr Pavlovich Borisenko witnessed the execution:

{{quotation|When they put her on the stool, the girl turned her face toward the fence. The executioners wanted her to stand with her face to the crowd, but she turned away and that was that. No matter how much they pushed her and tried to turn her, she remained standing with her back to the crowd. Only then did they kick away the stool from under her.}}

Olga Shcherbatsevich, the mother of Volodia Shcherbatsevich, was hanged the same day as her son with two other members of the resistance in front of the [[National Academy of Sciences of Belarus]].&lt;ref&gt;''A Historical Injustice: the case of Masha Bruskina''; by Nechama Tec and Daniel Weiss, University of Connecticut in Stamford, ''Johns Hopkins University Holocaust and Genocide Studies''; 1997 11(3):366-377; {{doi|10.1093/hgs/11.3.366}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Identification and remembrance==
For decades after the war, Bruskina was officially referred to only as "the unknown girl", allegedly due to [[antisemitism]] from Soviet authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=D0ojAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=zM4FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1880%2C348797 | title=Did Soviets hide identity of executed teen in 1941? | work=The Palm Beach Post | date=Sep 16, 1987 | accessdate=30 May 2015 | author=Keller, Bill | pages=D1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Up to 2009, Bruskina's name was not acknowledged on the memorial plaque at the execution place. However, since 2009, a new memorial plaque at the execution place has been placed. The Russian inscription now reads "Here on October 26, 1941 the Fascists executed the Soviet patriots K. I. Truss, V. I. Sherbateyvich and M. B. Bruskina". Bruskina was first recognized in the 1960s, as most of her family and friends had been killed in the [[Minsk Ghetto]].&lt;ref&gt;http://spartacus-educational.com/2WWbruskina.htm&lt;/ref&gt; A monument for Bruskina was erected in [[HaKfar HaYarok]] in [[Israel]], and a street was named after her in [[Jerusalem]].

'''Morning Star''' ([[Cheyenne language|Cheyenne]]: '''''Vóóhéhéve''''';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cdkc.edu/cheyennedictionary/index-en.htm|title=Cheyenne Dictionary|accessdate=December 21, 2017|format=December 21, 2017 version|publisher=Chief Dull Knife College}}&lt;/ref&gt; also known by his [[Lakota language|Lakota Sioux]] name '''''Tȟamílapȟéšni''''' or its translation, '''Dull Knife'''&lt;ref&gt;Recorded as "Tah-me-la-pash-me", from '''''tȟa-''''' (his) + '''''míla''''' (big knife) + '''''pȟéšni''''' (dull).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Buechel |first=Eugene |author2=Paul Manhart |title=Lakota Dictionary: Lakota-English/English-Lakota |origyear=1970 |edition=New Comprehensive |year=2002 |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |location=Lincoln and London |isbn=0-8032-1305-0 |oclc=49312425}}&lt;/ref&gt;) (1810–1883) was a great chief of the [[Cheyenne|Northern Cheyenne]] people and headchief of the ''Notameohmésêhese'' ("Northern Eaters"; also simply known as ''Ȯhmésėhese'' or "Eaters") band on the northern [[Great Plains]] during the 19th century. He was noted for his active resistance to westward expansion and the United States federal government. It is due to the courage and determination of Morning Star and other leaders that the Northern Cheyenne still possess a homeland in their traditional country in present-day [[Montana]].

Although he was known as "Dull Knife" (or ''Motšêške Ôhnêxahpo'' in Cheyenne, a translation of his Lakota name) to local settlers, U.S. military leaders, and other American Indians, his Cheyenne name is translated as "Morning Star". A Cheyenne warrior in every sense of the word, Morning Star was described by many writers of the era as "an admirable outlaw" comparable to the likes of [[Robert Roy MacGregor|Rob Roy]] and [[William Wallace]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

==Life==
[[File:Little Coyote and Morning Star.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Little Wolf|Little Coyote (Little Wolf)]] and Morning Star (Dull Knife), chiefs of the Northern Cheyenne]]
In 1868, Morning Star represented his tribe at the signing of the [[Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868)|Treaty of Fort Laramie]]. Following Custer's Last Stand at the [[Battle of the Little Bighorn]] during the [[Great Sioux War of 1876]], Morning Star allied with the [[Sioux]] and other tribes against the United States. However, after [[Dull Knife Fight|a destructive raid]] by American soldiers under Colonel [[Ranald S. Mackenzie]] in which 200 lodges were destroyed and 700 livestock captured, most of the Cheyenne were eventually forced to surrender.&lt;ref name=Bourke&gt;{{Cite book |last=Bourke |first=John |title=Mackenzie's Last Fight with the Cheyennes |publisher=Argonaut Press Ltd. |year=1966 |pages=36, 39, 55}}&lt;/ref&gt; They expected to live on reservations with the Sioux in the north, but were subsequently transported to the [[Cheyenne and Arapaho Indian Reservation|Darlington Agency in the Southern Cheyenne Reservation]] in the [[Indian Territory]].

Unable to hunt sufficient game while on the reservation, the tribe suffered from starvation and disease until September 1878, when Morning Star [[Northern Cheyenne Exodus|led the tribe north]], back toward their ancient homelands. Fighting through, the Cheyenne were able to outmaneuver federal troops across the plains and in the [[Sandhills (Nebraska)|Nebraska Sand Hills]] until they were captured near [[Fort Robinson]]. The tribe was said to have taken apart their guns and hidden the pieces under blankets or as necklaces and bracelets worn by children. Though Morning Star explained that his people would put up no further resistance if allowed to live with [[Red Cloud]] on the [[Pine Ridge Indian Reservation]] in the [[Dakota Territory]], the Army still insisted that they return south to the Southern Cheyenne reservation. On January 8, 1879, the Northern Cheyenne tried to escape the fort using the dismantled guns they had hidden upon their arrival, but they were quickly pursued; many Cheyenne, mostly women and children, were killed by federal troops in the [[Fort Robinson massacre]]. However, a few of the tribe managed to escape, including Morning Star, who eventually reached the Pine Ridge Agency and was held as a prisoner until he and the survivors were allowed to settle on a reservation near [[Fort Keogh]] in the [[Montana Territory]].

==Legacy==
Morning Star died in 1883 and is interred on the Northern Cheyenne reservation at Lame Deer Cemetery. [[Chief Dull Knife College]], which is also in [[Lame Deer, Montana|Lame Deer]], is named in his honor. As Dull Knife, his photograph appears in [[Dee Brown (writer)|Dee Brown]]'s 1971 bestseller ''[[Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee]]''.

Actor [[Ian MacDonald (actor)|Ian McDonald]] played Dull Knife in the May 1957 episode "Dull Knife Strikes for Freedom" on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]/[[Desilu]] [[Western (genre)|western]] television series, ''[[The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp]]'', with [[Hugh O'Brian]] in the title role as deputy marshal [[Wyatt Earp]]. In the episode, Dull Knife leads his Indians from their reservation in [[Oklahoma Territory]] to their homeland in [[Montana]], which they claim the U.S. government had promised them. Meanwhile, some of their braves attack and burn a white settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0631782/?ref_=tt_ep_ep19|title="Dull Knife Strikes for Freedom", ''The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp'', May 7, 1957|publisher=[[Internet Movie Data Base]]|accessdate=April 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Pierre d'Ailly.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Pierre d'Ailly.]]
'''Pierre d'Ailly''' ({{IPA-fr|d‿aji|lang}}; [[Latin]] ''Petrus Aliacensis'', ''Petrus de Alliaco''; 1351{{snd}}9 August 1420) was a [[France|French]] [[theology|theologian]], [[astrologer]], and [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]].

==Academic career==
D'Ailly was born in [[Compiègne]] in 1350 or 1351 of a prosperous bourgeois family. He studied in Paris at the [[Collège de Navarre]],{{sfn|Valois|1911|p=438}} receiving the licentiate in arts in 1367 and the masters a year later.&lt;ref&gt;Pascoe, p. 8,&lt;/ref&gt; and was active in university affairs by 1372.&lt;ref&gt;Smoller, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  D'Ailly taught the Bible in 1375 and the ''Sentences'' of [[Peter Lombard]] in 1376–1377, and received the licentiate and doctorate in theology in 1381.  He was affiliated with the Collège, serving as rector in 1384; among his pupils were [[Jean Gerson]] and [[Nicholas of Clémanges]].

The church's [[Western Schism|Great Schism]], between two popes, arose in 1378. In the spring of 1379 Pierre d'Ailly, in anticipation even of the decision of the [[University of Paris]], had carried to the pope of [[Avignon]], [[Clement VII]] the "role" of the French nation, but notwithstanding this prompt adhesion he was firm in his desire to put an end to the schism, and when, on the 20th of May 1381, the university decreed that the best means to this end was to try to gather together a [[Catholic Ecumenical Councils|general council]], Pierre d'Ailly supported this motion before the king's council in the presence of the [[Louis I, Duke of Anjou|duke of Anjou]]. The dissatisfaction displayed shortly after by the government obliged the university to give up this scheme, and was probably the cause of Pierre d'Ailly's temporary retirement to [[Noyon]], where he held a [[Canon (priest)|canonry]]. There he continued the struggle for his side in a humorous work, in which the partisans of the council are amusingly taken to task by the demon [[Leviathan]].{{sfn|Valois|1911|p=438}}

D'Ailly returned to prominence  by leading the university's effort to secure removal of John Blanchard as [[Chancellor of the University of Paris|chancellor]], in which Blanchard was accused by d'Ailly before the Avignon [[antipope Clement VII]] of abuse of office.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, pp. 60-176.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, d'Ailly was twice entrusted with a mission to Clement VII in 1388 to defend the doctrines of the university, and especially those concerning the [[Immaculate Conception]] of the Virgin, against the preaching friar [[John of Montson|Jean de Montson]], and in 1389 to petition in the name of the king for the canonization of the young [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|cardinal]] [[Pierre de Luxembourg]]. The success which attended his efforts on these two occasions, and the eloquence which he displayed, perhaps contributed to his choice as the king's [[almoner]] and [[confessor]]. At the same time, by means of an exchange, he obtained to the highest dignity in the university, becoming [[Chancellor (ecclesiastical)|chancellor]] of [[Notre Dame de Paris]].{{sfn|Valois|1911|p=438}} This acceptability to many interests helps explain his advancement.&lt;ref&gt;Smoller, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

D'Ailly served as chancellor of the University from 1389 to 1395, and Gerson succeeded him. Both were involved in expelling the [[Dominican Order]] from the university for refusing to embrace the idea of the Immaculate Conception and in the effort mentioned above to end the Great Schism by means of an ecumenical council.

When [[Antipope Benedict XIII]] succeeded Clement VII at Avignon in 1394, Pierre d'Ailly was entrusted by the king with a mission of congratulation to the new pontiff. His obsequious language on this occasion, and the favours with which it was rewarded, formed a too violent contrast to the determined attitude of the university of Paris, which, tired of the schism, was even then demanding the resignation of the two pontiffs. Pierre d'Ailly himself had not long before taken part in the drawing up of a letter to the king in which the advantages of this double abdication were set forth, but since then his zeal had seemed to cool a little. Nevertheless, on his return from Avignon, he again in the presence of the king enlarged upon the advantages offered by the way which the university commended.{{sfn|Valois|1911|p=438}}

But the suspicions aroused by his conduct found further confirmation when he caused himself—or allowed himself—to be nominated bishop of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Le Puy-en-Velay|Le Puy]] by Benedict on 2 April 1395. The great number of [[benefice]]s which he held left room for some doubt as to his disinterestedness. Henceforward he was under suspicion at the university, and was excluded from the assemblies where the union was discussed.{{sfn|Valois|1911|p=438}}

==Ecclesiastical career==

===Appointments===
D'Ailly's ecclesiastical career prospered, however. After Le Puy, he was appointed [[Ancient Diocese of Noyon|bishop of Noyon]], and [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cambrai|bishop of Cambrai]] (1397).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite NIE|title=Ailly, Pierre|url=https://archive.org/stream/newinternational01gilm#page/231/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt; By virtue of this position, he became also a [[Princes of the Holy Roman Empire|prince of the Holy Roman Empire]]. In order to take possession of his new [[episcopal see]], he had to brave the wrath of [[Philip the Bold|Philip, duke of Burgundy]], override the resistance of the [[clergy]] and [[bourgeoisie]], and even withstand an armed attack on the part of several lords; but his protector, the duke of Orleans, had his investiture performed by [[Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia|Wenceslaus]], king of the Romans. The latter, though a partisan of the pope of Rome, took the opportunity of enjoining on Pierre d'Ailly to go in his name and argue with the pope of Avignon, a move which had as its object to persuade Benedict to an abdication, the necessity of which was becoming more and more evident. However, the language of the bishop of Cambrai seems on this occasion to have been lacking in decision; however that may be, it led to no felicitous result.{{sfn|Valois|1911|p=438}} From this point on, he spent most of his energy to addressing the schism. Although he was slow at first to embrace the [[Conciliarism|conciliar]] solution to the Schism, he was participating in councils by 1409.

===Schismatic pressures===
France next tried to bring violent pressure to bear to conquer the obstinacy of Benedict XIII by threatening a formal withdrawal from his obedience. Pierre d'Ailly, who, in spite of his attachment to the pope, had been carried away by the example of the kingdom, was among the first who, in 1403, after experience of what had happened, counselled and celebrated the restoration of obedience. He was sent by [[Charles VI of France|Charles VI]] on an embassy to Benedict and seized this opportunity of lavishing on the pontiff friendly congratulations mingled with useful advice. Two years later, before the same pontiff, he preached in the city of [[Genoa]] a sermon which led to the general institution, in the countries of the obedience of Avignon, of the festival of the [[Trinity|Holy Trinity]].{{sfn|Valois|1911|p=438}}

At the ecclesiastical council which took place at Paris in 1406, Pierre d'Ailly made every effort to avert a new withdrawal from the obedience and, by order of the king, took the part of defender of Benedict XIII, a course which yet again exposed him to attacks from the university party. The following year he and his disciple Gerson formed part of the great embassy sent by the princes to the two pontiffs, and while in Italy he was occupied in praiseworthy but vain efforts to induce the pope of Rome to remove himself to a town on the Italian coast, in the neighbourhood of his rival, where it was hoped that the double abdication would take place. Discouraged by his failure to effect this, he returned to his diocese of Cambrai at the beginning of 1408. At this time he was still faithful to Benedict, and the disinclination he felt to joining the members of the French clergy who were on the point of ratifying the royal declaration of neutrality excited the anger of Charles VI's government, and a [[mandate (criminal law)|mandate]], which was however not executed, ordered the arrest of the bishop.{{sfn|Valois|1911|p=438}}

===Conciliar councils===
It was not until after the cardinals of the two colleges had led to the convocation of the [[Council of Pisa]] (1409) that Pierre d'Ailly renounced the support of Benedict XIII, and, for want of a better policy, again allied himself with the cause which he had championed in his youth. In the council lay now, to judge from his words, the only chance of salvation; and, in view of the requirements of the case, he began to argue that, in case of schism, a council could be convoked by any one of the faithful, and would have the right to judge and even to depose the rival pontiffs. This was, in fact, the procedure of the council of Pisa, in which Pierre d'Ailly took part. After the declaration of the deposition of the Roman pope [[Pope Gregory XII|Gregory XII]] and Benedict XIII, the council went on to the election of [[Antipope Alexander V|Alexander V]] (June 26, 1409). This pope reigned only ten months; his successor, [[Antipope John XXIII|John XXIII]], raised Pierre d'Ailly to the rank of cardinal (June 6, 1411), and further, to indemnify him for the loss of the bishopric of Cambrai, conferred upon him the administration of that of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Limoges|Limoges]] (November 3, 1412), which was shortly after exchanged for the [[Ancient Diocese of Orange|bishopric of Orange]]. He also nominated Pierre d'Ailly as his [[Papal legate|legate]] in Germany (March 18, 1413).{{sfn|Valois|1911|p=438}}

Forgetting these benefits, d'Ailly was one of the most formidable adversaries of John XXIII at the [[Council of Constance]] (1414–1418); with Gerson, d'Ailly was one of the leading theologians at the council.&lt;ref&gt;Stump, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Convinced as he was of the necessity for union and reform, he contributed more than anyone to the adoption of the principle that, since the schism had survived the [[Council of Pisa]], it was necessary again to take up the work for a fundamental union, without considering the rights of John XXIII any more than they had those of Gregory XII and Benedict XIII. From this point of view Pierre d'Ailly, together with his compatriot [[Guillaume Fillastre|Cardinal Fillastre]], took the preponderating part during the first few months. Afterwards, seeing the trend of events, he showed some uneasiness and hesitation. He refused, however, to undertake the defence of John XXIII, and only appeared in the trial of this pope to make [[Deposition (law)|depositions]] against him, which were sometimes of an overwhelming character.{{sfn|Valois|1911|p=438}}

Among the other matters which claimed his attention at Constance may be mentioned also the condemnation of the errors of [[John Wycliffe]] and the trial of [[Jan Hus]]. The reading in public of Hus's two treatises ''De Potestate ecclesiastica'' and ''De Reformatione Ecclesiae'' revealed, besides ideas very peculiar to himself on the reform and constitution of the church, his design of reducing the power of the [[English people|English]] in the council by denying them the right of forming a separate nation (October 1{{snd}}November 1, 1416). By this campaign, which exposed him to the worst retaliation of the English, he inaugurated his role of "procurator and defender of the king of France."{{sfn|Valois|1911|pp=438-439}}

When at last the question arose of giving the Christian world a new pope, this time sole and uncontested, Pierre d'Ailly defended the right of the cardinals, if not to keep the election entirely in their own hands, at any rate to share in the election, and he brought forward an ingenious system for reconciling the pretensions of the council with the rights of the [[College of Cardinals]]. In this way was elected [[Pope Martin V]] (November 11, 1417), and the task of Pierre d'Ailly was at last finished.{{sfn|Valois|1911|p=439}}

==Retirement==
After the council, d'Ailly returned to Paris.  When in France's civil discord the Burgundian faction seized Paris in 1419, killing some professors in the process, he fled south and retired to [[Avignon]].&lt;ref&gt;Guenée, pp. 252-253.&lt;/ref&gt;  His former pupil Gerson settled nearby at a house of the [[Celestine Order]].  D'Ailly, known as the Cardinal of Cambrai, died in 1420 in Avignon.

==Writings==
D'Ailly wrote extensively on the Schism, reform, astrology and other topics.  His ideas on the powers of the [[college of cardinals]] and the [[infallibility]] of the general council were very influential.&lt;ref&gt;Francis Oakley, "Pierre d'Ailly and Papal Infallibility," ''Mediaeval Studies'' 26 (1964), 353-358.&lt;/ref&gt;  D'Ailly's ''Imago Mundi'' (1410), a work of [[cosmography]], influenced [[Christopher Columbus]] in his estimates of the size of world land-mass. Many questions in science and astrology, such as [[calendar reform]], attracted his attention.{{sfn|Valois|1911|p=439}} His views on astrology, expressed in several works, attempted to balance divine omniscience and human [[free will]].&lt;ref&gt;See the chronology of these works in Smoller, pp. 136-137.&lt;/ref&gt; D'Ailly's writings on the Schism put the crisis and the need for reform into an apocalyptic context.&lt;ref&gt;Pascoe, pp. 11-51.&lt;/ref&gt;  His astrology also was tied to the Schism, attempting to determine whether the division of the church was a sign of the coming of the [[Antichrist]].&lt;ref&gt;Smoller, pp. 85-86.&lt;/ref&gt; His works began appearing in print before the end of the fifteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Smoller, pp. 133-134.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
In ''[[The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon]]'', [[Karl Marx]] wrote that d'Ailly had told advocates of ethical reform at the Council of Constance, "Only the devil in person can still save the Catholic Church, and you ask for angels."&lt;ref&gt;K. Marx (1869), ''The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte'', 1934 translation, Moscow:  Progress Publishers, Chapter VII, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

The crater [[Aliacensis (crater)|Aliacensis]] on the Moon is named after him.

'''Rakhimzhan Qoshqarbaev''' ([[Kazakh language|Kazakh]]: Рақымжан Қошқарбаев, Raqımjan Qoşqarbayev; [[Russian language|Russian]]: Рахимжан Кошкарбаев) was the first soldier to raise the [[Flag of the Soviet Union|Soviet Flag]] at the [[Reichstag building]] in [[Berlin]], having become so after placing the flag by a staircase in the opera hall after sneaking into the building. After nightfall Qoshqarbaev and several of his comrades raised the flag on the roof. However, because they had raised the flag in the night when it was too dark to take a photo, none of them were part of the [[Raising a Flag over the Reichstag|iconic photo of Soviet soldiers raising the flag]] on 2 May. After the raising of the flag on 30 April it was shot down down by German snipers shortly before the Wehrmacht retook control of the building. However, by 2 May the Soviets retook control of the building and raised the flag again, bringing photographer [[Yevgeny Khaldei]] with them to capture a reenactment of the historic moment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ru.sputniknews.kz/society/20161019/855560/rahimzhan-koshkarbaev-on-byl-pervym-na-rejhstage.html|title=Рахимжан Кошкарбаев: он был первым на Рейхстаге|last=Sputnik|website=ru.sputniknews.kz|language=ru|access-date=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tengrinews.kz/kazakhstan_news/rahimjanu-koshkarbaevu-vodruzivshemu-znamya-pobedyi-293987/|title=Рахимжану Кошкарбаеву, водрузившему Знамя Победы на Рейхстаге, хотят присвоить звание Героя России|website=Tengrinews.kz|language=ru|access-date=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Berlin: The Downfall 1945]]|last=Beevor|first=Antony|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]|year=2003|isbn=978-0-14-028696-0|location=London|ref=harv|authorlink=Antony Beevor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Qoshqarbaev was born on 19 October 1924 in the village of Akmolinsk in within the Kyrgyz ASSR, currently located within the present-day city of Astana. He was sent to an orphanage at the age of 13 after his was repressed and declared an "[[enemy of the people]]" during the [[Great Purge]] in 1937. After completing seven years of secondary school he worked in a factory until he was allowed to join the Red Army.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.ivest.kz/124640937-na-istoricheskuyu-rekonstrukciyu-shturma-reyhstaga-priedet-doch-rahmzhana-koshkarbaeva|title=На историческую реконструкцию штурма Рейхстага приедет дочь Рахмжана Кошкарбаева|website=news.ivest.kz|language=ru|access-date=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== World War II ==
Immediately after the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941 Qoshqarbaev attempted to join the Red Army but was initially rejected because he was only sixteen years old at the time. He reapplied shortly before his eighteenth birthday in August 1942 and was sent for training in the city of [[Kokshetau]], which he completed in 1943. He was then sent for officer training at the Tambov All-Commander Infantry School, which he graduated from with honors before being sent to the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] as a junior lieutenant in October 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aif.ru/society/people/neprobivaemyy_kto_pervym_vodruzil_krasnoe_znamya_nad_reyhstagom|title=Непробиваемый. Кто первым водрузил красное знамя над Рейхстагом?|last=Набатникова|first=Марина|website=www.aif.ru|access-date=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1945 Qoshqarbaev distinguished himself while leading a platoon on an assault on enemy defenses, located on the Western bank of the Oder River; on April 17, one day after breaking through the enemy bridgehead, he led his unit towards a river channel to establish a new bridgehead and continued the advance despite heavy resistance from Axis forces. After Soviet forces opened fire on approaching enemy forces Qoshqarbaev entered the water, led his unit in the perilous crossing, and proceeded to storm a German trench after reaching the western bank of the canal. During the heavy fighting of that engagement over 40 German soldiers were killed after the platoon seized three machine guns in hand-to-hand combat and opened fire on the remaining German soldiers in the trench. After taking over the trench they established a firing point and gunned down the remaining enemy combatants in the area. After Qoshqarbaev's success in the Oder offensive, his platoon became the first unit to cross the [[Spree|Spree river]], doing so under heavy enemy fire. From the time of Oder crossing to when he raised the flag over the Reichstag in Berlin, his platoon killed over 200 German soldiers and held 184 of them hostage, took 27 high-caliber machine-guns, and obtained many other weapons that were once in the hands of enemy soldiers. When the war ended Qoshqarbaev was a Lieutenant and the commander of a reconnaissance platoon belonging the 674th Infantry Regiment in the 150th Infantry Division.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  

=== Raising the flag over the Reichstag ===
Qoshqarbaev initially placed the flag of the Soviet Union atop the staircase in front of the main entrance to the building on 30 April 1945 at 14:25 after sneaking into the building with another soldier, Grigory Bulatov. The flag was presented to the group of soldiers assigned to raising the flag over the building by a regimental commander; the meeting where the flag was given to them was held in Himmler's house. After Qoshqarbaev originally placed the flag in the entrance by the staircase under the watch of Ivan Klochkov they went on to place it atop the building; the soldiers then jumped out of a window and ran across the roof, but after coming under heavy fire they laid low on the roof for several hours and waited for the artillery fire to cease. While waiting for the opportunity to hoist up the flag Qoshqarbaev and Bulatov wrote their names and regiment numbers on the flag. After nightfall the artillery fire eventually died down and under the cover of darkness Bulatov and Qoshqarbaev raised the flag over the Reichstag. However, the flag was later shot down by German snipers. Qoshqarbaev and Bulatov were nominated for the title Hero of the Soviet Union but instead awarded the Order of the Red Banner; neither of them were present in the photo ''[[Raising a Flag over the Reichstag]]'' taken on 2 May by [[Yevgeny Khaldei]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.inform.kz/kz/erligi-62-zhyldan-son-gana-moyyndalgan-rakymzhan-koshkarbaev_a2200323|title=Ерлігі 62 жылдан соң ғана мойындалған Рақымжан Қошқарбаев|last=INFORM.KZ|website=www.inform.kz|language=ru|access-date=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://militera.lib.ru/memo/russian/klochkov_if/index.html|title=Мы штурмовали рейхстаг|last=Klochkov|first=Ivan|publisher=Лениздат|year=1986|isbn=|location=|pages=137-190|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

== Later life ==
After the war, Qoshqarbaev was the manager of the Alma-Ata Hotel. Unlike another Kazakh hero of the war, [[Bauyrzhan Momyshuly|Baurzhan Momyshuly]], Qoshqarbaev was never awarded the title [[Hero of the Soviet Union]], despite several petitions to Brezhnev from high-profile veterans of the war and other Kazakhs awarded the title of hero asking that Qoshqarbaev be declared a Hero of the Soviet Union. Many suspected the reason for his not receiving the award was the fact his father had been declared an [[enemy of the people]]. Qoshqarbaev passed away in August 1988. Over a decade after his death he was posthumously declared a [[Hero of Kazakhstan]] on 7 May 1999 by decree of the President of Kazakhstan [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hbd-CQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA12#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Аргументы и факты|date=2017-04-29|publisher=Litres|isbn=9785457781092|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6rV3CQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA74#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Сердцем подвиг пережить|last=Grigorjeva|first=Tamara|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=9781326165352|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|name=Hero of Kazakhstan|Most sources indicate Qoshqarbayev was declared a Hero of Kazakhstan on 7 May 1999, although one source indicates he was awarded the title in 2001}}

'''Samuel W. Ferguson''' (born '''Samuel Wragg Ferguson'''; November 3, 1834 – February 3, 1917) was a senior [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]] of the [[Confederate States Army]] who commanded [[cavalry]] in the [[Western Theater of the American Civil War|Western Theater]] of the [[American Civil War]]. After the war, he also served as a member of the [[Mississippi Valley Division|Mississippi River Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|title=The Cavalry Reunion|work=Weekly Democrat-Times|volume=20|number=31|location=Greenville, Miss.|date=February 18, 1888|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Samuel W. Ferguson graduated from the [[United States Military Academy]] in 1857. Before graduation, he joined [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [[Albert Sidney Johnson]]'s [[Utah War]] to fight the [[Mormon]]s. He then went to [[St. Louis]] to join his [[regiment]]. After the expedition, he was assigned to [[Fort Walla Walla]] in the [[Washington Territory]], where he stayed from 1859 to 1860. This all changed when he received the results of the [[United States presidential election, 1860|1860 presidential election]]. Hearing of the election of [[Abraham Lincoln]], he immediately resigned and left for [[Charleston, South Carolina]].&lt;ref name="KSHS"&gt;''Kansas State Historical Society's Collections of the Kansas State Historical Society'' (1912) pg. 303.&lt;/ref&gt;

==American Civil War==
In March 1861, Ferguson was commissioned a [[Captain (armed forces)|captain]] in the [[South Carolina Army National Guard|South Carolina militia]], afterwards being appointed [[Lieutenant]] and [[aide-de-camp]] to [[Confederate States of America|C.S.]] [[Brigadier general|Brigadier-General]] [[P. G. T. Beauregard]]. He was one of the officers who received the formal surrender of [[Major (United States)|U.S. Major]] [[Robert Anderson (Civil War)|Robert Anderson]] at [[Battle of Fort Sumter|Fort Sumter]], raised the first [[Flags of the Confederate States of America|Confederate States flag]], and posted the first guards at Fort Sumter. After the siege, he was sent to present the first Confederate flag struck by enemy shot to the [[Provisional Congress of the Confederate States]].&lt;ref name="KSHS" /&gt; He was a [[Lieutenant colonel|lieutenant-colonel]] and aide-de-camp to General Beauregard during the [[Battle of Shiloh]]. During the [[Siege of Corinth|Battle of Farmington]], he was in the 28th Mississippi Cavalry Regiment. He commanded the unit while defending [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]], and helped stop attacks made by [[Major general (United States)|U.S. Major-General]] [[William Tecumseh Sherman|William T. Sherman]] and [[Commodore (United States)|U.S. Commodore]] [[David Dixon Porter|David Porter]].

On July 28, 1863, Ferguson was promoted to brigadier-general. He was subsequently recommended for promotion to [[Major general|Major-General]], but [[Joseph Wheeler]] quickly objected.&lt;ref name=Warner&gt;[[Ezra J. Warner (historian)|Warner, Ezra J.]] ''Generals in Gray: Lives of the Confederate Commanders.'' Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1959, p. 89, {{ISBN|978-0-8071-0823-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; During [[Sherman's March to the Sea]], Ferguson and his cavalrymen harassed the flank of the [[United States Army]]. When Sherman got close to [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]], Ferguson's men left their horses and covered the Confederate retreat. He was then ordered to [[Danville, Virginia]], but before arriving was ordered to go to [[Charlotte, North Carolina]]. From Charlotte he escorted [[Jefferson Davis]] into Georgia, where his unit was disbanded.&lt;ref name=Wyatt-Brown107&gt;Wyatt-Brown, Betram, ''The Literary Percys: Family History, Gender &amp; the Southern Imagination'' (1994) pg. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
After the war Ferguson moved to [[Greenville, Mississippi]], where he practiced [[law]]. He married [[Kate Lee Ferguson|Catherine Sarah Lee]], daughter of Henry William and [[Eleanor Percy Lee]] who was a cousin of [[Robert E. Lee|Robert Edward Lee]].&lt;ref name="Wyatt-Brown107" /&gt; In 1876, he was appointed as president of the United States Board of Mississippi River Commissioners. He was also secretary and treasurer of the Mississippi Levee Board. In 1894, twenty thousand&lt;ref name=Black,9,10&gt;Black, Patti Carr and Marion Barnwell, ''Touring Literary Mississippi'' (2002) pg. 9&amp;ndash;10.&lt;/ref&gt; to forty thousand dollars&lt;ref name=Wyatt-Brown46&gt;Wyatt-Brown, Betram, ''The Literary Percys: Family History, Gender &amp; the Southern Imagination'' (1994) pg. 46&amp;ndash;47.&lt;/ref&gt; mysteriously disappeared from the Mississippi Levee Board, of which Ferguson was both secretary and treasurer.&lt;ref name="Black,9,10"/&gt; Later that year, he suddenly left and moved to his hometown of Charleston where worked as a [[civil engineer]]. After staying in Charleston, Ferguson moved to [[Ecuador]]. It would be many years before he returned.&lt;ref name="Black,9,10"/&gt; At the outbreak of the [[Spanish–American War]], he tried to join the war effort but he was turned down.&lt;ref name="KSHS" /&gt; On February 3, 1917, Ferguson died in [[Jackson, Mississippi]], where he is buried at the [[Greenwood Cemetery, Mississippi|Greenwood Cemetery]] along with other famous Confederate generals.&lt;ref name="Warner"/&gt;

While a law student, Neumeier authored a pamphlet on the use of [[Physical restraint|restraint and seclusion]] on [[Special education in the United States|special education]] students in Massachusetts public schools, as an intern for the [[Mental Health Legal Advisors Committee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.constantcontact.com/fs037/1102157695491/archive/1103545827214.html|title=Rappaport Center Spring/Summer Newsletter|website=archive.constantcontact.com|access-date=2018-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating from [[Smith College]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.smith.edu/news/2008-09/seniorstoryshain-135.php|title=Smith College: News|website=www.smith.edu|access-date=2018-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Suffolk University Law School]], Neumeier worked on [[youth rights]] policy issues for the [[Community Alliance for the Ethical Treatment of Youth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://autismnow.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Autistic-View-Of-Employment-Edited.pdf|title=An Autistic View of Employment: Advice, Essays, Stories, and More from Autistic Self Advocates|last=Autism NOW Center|first=|date=June 2013|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neumeier represented CAFETY at an industry conference of children's and youth behavioral modification residential treatment programs hosted by the American Association of Children’s Residential Centers, at which Neumeier advocated against the use of what they described as "fear-based marketing techniques" advertising quick fixes for challenging behavior and for more stringent regulations on treatment programs for youth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120055821/http://www.cafety.org/legislation/state-legislation/853-cafetys-qnational-gatheringq-report-sponsored-by-natsap-a-aacrc|title=CAFETY's Report on the NATSAP &amp; AACRC sponsored "National Gathering"|date=2013-01-20|access-date=2018-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2013, upon invitation by the [[United Nations special rapporteur on torture|United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture]], Neumeier joined CAFETY's Executive Director Kathryn Whitehead for an expert consultation meeting hosted at the [[Center for Human Rights &amp; Humanitarian Law|Center for Human Rights and Humanitarian Law]] on [[United Nations Convention against Torture|torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment]] in health-care settings with [[International human rights law|international human rights]] organizations, and delivered a presentation on systemic patterns of abuses in youth residential treatment programs, which CAFETY refers to as the [[Behavior modification facility|troubled teen industry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120055650/http://www.cafety.org/press/110-press-release/915-cafety-un-meeting-troubled-teen|title=UN Meeting: With Your Support, International Recognition|date=2013-01-20|access-date=2018-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Arthur-Pyle Sir Kay showeth the mystic sword unto Sir Ector.JPG|thumb|''Sir Kay showeth the mystic sword unto Sir Ector'', by [[Howard Pyle]] from ''The Story of King Arthur and His Knights''. (1903)]]

'''Sir Ector''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛ|k|t|ɔːr|,_|-|ər}}, sometimes '''Hector''', '''Antor''', or '''Ectorius''', is the father of [[Sir Kay]] and the adoptive father of [[King Arthur]] in the [[Arthurian legend]]. Sometimes portrayed as a king instead of merely a lord, he has an estate in the country as well as properties in [[London]]. 

Ector appears in the works of [[Robert de Boron]] and the [[Lancelot-Grail]] Cycle, as well as later adaptations such as the [[Post-Vulgate Cycle]] and [[Thomas Malory]]'s ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]''. In these versions, [[Merlin]] takes Arthur from his biological parents King [[Uther Pendragon]] and [[Igraine]], and brings him to Ector's estate. Merlin does not reveal the boy's true identity, and Ector takes him on and raises him with Kay as his own son. When Kay is old enough to be knighted, Ector's young ward serves as his squire. 

In ''[[The Once and Future King]]'' [[T. H. White]] says his lands lie in the "Forest Sauvage"; some later writers have used this as well. 

In the earlier Welsh stories, the father of Kay (Cei) is instead named Cynyr (Kyner).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyfiles.co.uk/KingListsBritain/CymruDemetia.htm Celtic Kingdoms of the British Isles].&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Other Media==
*In the 1963 Disney animated musical-fantasy-comedy movie ''[[The Sword in the Stone (film)|The Sword in the Stone]]'', Sir Ector is voiced by actor [[Sebastian Cabot (actor)|Sebastian Cabot]] and often treats Arthur harshly, and possesses a clear authority over him, treating him more as a servant, while doting on his birth son Kay. However, he does care for Arthur, as shown in his first scene, where he scolds Kay for allowing Arthur to go into the forest alone and worried that he might be dead. He also appoints him as Kay's [[squire]], and clearly has affection for Arthur, and does not always want to treat him poorly, but rather feels responsible for his welfare. After Arthur is revealed as the rightful King of England, he regrets his mistreatment of the boy and (out of fear of his former charge's reprisal) begs for Arthur's forgiveness.
*In the 1981 epic fantasy film ''[[Excalibur (film)| Excalibur]]'', Sir Ector is portrayed by actor [[Clive Swift]].
*In the 2011 historical-fantasy-drama TV series ''[[Camelot (TV series)|Camelot]]'' Sir Ector is portrayed by actor [[Sean Pertwee]].

'''Thomas Ashe''' (1770–1835) was an Irish novelist and miscellaneous writer.

==Biography==
Ashe was the third son of a [[half-pay]] officer, and was born at [[Glasnevin]], near [[Dublin]], 15 July 1770. He received a commission in the [[83rd (County of Dublin) Regiment of Foot|83rd regiment of foot]], which, however, was almost immediately afterwards disbanded; and he was sent to a [[counting-house]] at [[Bordeaux]]. There he suffered a short imprisonment for wounding in a [[duel]] a gentleman whose sister he had seduced, but, the wound not proving fatal, the prosecution was not persisted in.

Returning to Dublin, Ashe was appointed secretary to the Diocesan and Endowed Schools Commission, but, getting into debt, resigned his office and retired to Switzerland. He then spent several years in foreign travel, living, according to his own account,&lt;ref&gt;Memoirs and Confessions, 3 vols. 1815&lt;/ref&gt; in a free and unconstrained fashion, and experiencing a somewhat chequered fortune.

In his later years Ashe was short of money. He died at Bath on 17 December 1835.

==Works==
Besides recording in his ''Memoirs'' his impressions of the countries he visited, Ashe published separately:

* ''Travels in America in 1806'', 1808; 
* ''Memoirs of [[Mammoth]] and other Bones found in the vicinity of the [[Ohio]]'', 1806; and 
* ''A Commercial and Geographical Sketch of Brazil and [[Madeira]]'', 1812.

He was also the author of novels, including the ''Spirit of the Book'', 1811, 4th edition 1812; the ''Liberal Critic, or Henry Percy'', 1812: and the ''Soldier of Fortune'', 1816.

'''Val Logsdon Fitch''' (March 10, 1923 – February 5, 2015) was an American [[nuclear physics|nuclear physicist]] who, with co-researcher [[James Watson Cronin|James Cronin]], was  awarded the 1980 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for a 1964 experiment using the [[Alternating Gradient Synchrotron]] at [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] that proved that certain [[subatomic]] reactions do not adhere to fundamental symmetry principles. Specifically, they proved, by examining the decay of [[K-meson]]s, that a reaction run in reverse does not retrace the path of the original reaction, which showed that the reactions of subatomic particles are not indifferent to time. Thus the phenomenon of [[CP violation]] was discovered. This demolished the faith that physicists had that natural laws were governed by symmetry.

Born on a cattle ranch near [[Merriman, Nebraska]], Fitch was drafted into the U.S. Army during World War II, and worked on the [[Manhattan Project]] at the [[Los Alamos Laboratory]] in [[New Mexico]]. He later graduated from [[McGill University]], and completed his Ph.D. in [[physics]] in 1954 at [[Columbia University]].  He was a member of the faculty at [[Princeton University]] from 1954 until his retirement in 2005.

==Early life==
Val Logsdon Fitch was born on a cattle ranch near [[Merriman, Nebraska]], on March 10, 1923, the youngest of three children of Fred Fitch, a cattle rancher, and his wife Frances née Logsdon, a school teacher.&lt;ref name="autobio"&gt;{{Cite web  |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1980/fitch-bio.html  |title=Val Fitch – Biographical |publisher=Nobel Foundation  |accessdate=February 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had an older brother and sister.&lt;ref name="Finn Aserud"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aip.org/history/ohilist/33299.html |title=Interview with Val Fitch by Finn Aserud on December 18, 1986 |publisher=Niels Bohr Library and Archives, American Institute of Physics |accessdate=May 15, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The family farm was about {{convert|4|sqmi}} in size, and was about {{convert|40|mi}} from the site of the [[Wounded Knee Massacre]].&lt;ref name="autobio"/&gt; The ranch was a small one; his father specialized in raising breeding stock.&lt;ref name="Video"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/mediaplayer/index.php?id=1118 |title=Interview with Val Fitch |publisher=Nobel Foundation |accessdate=May 15, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after his birth, his father was badly injured in a horse riding accident and could no longer work on his ranch, so the family moved to the nearby town of [[Gordon, Nebraska]], where his father entered the insurance business.&lt;ref name="autobio"/&gt; It was here that he attended school,&lt;ref name="autobio"/&gt; graduating from Gordon High School in 1940 as [[valedictorian]].&lt;ref name="NNDB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Princeton"/&gt;

==Manhattan Project==
Fitch attended [[Chadron State College]] for three years, then transferred to [[Northwestern University]]; but this was during World War II, and his studies were interrupted by being drafted into the U.S. Army in 1943. After he had completed basic training, the Army sent him to [[Carnegie Institute of Technology]] for training under the [[Army Specialized Training Program]].&lt;ref name="Finn Aserud" /&gt; Under this program, some 200,000 soldiers attended colleges for intensive courses. Fitch was in the program for less than a year before the manpower requirements of the war became too great, and the Army terminated the program. Most of the soldiers in the ASTP were posted to combat units, but Fitch was one of a hundred or so ASTP soldiers who joined the [[Special Engineer Detachment]] (SED), which provided much-needed technicians to the [[Manhattan Project]].&lt;ref name="Finn Aserud" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ASTP"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pierce-evans.org/ASTP%20in%20WWII.htm |title=The Army Specialized Training Program In World War II |first=Louis E. |last=Keefer |accessdate=May 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SED"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nwsAAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA43&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=May 15, 2015 |title=All in Our Time: The View from the Bottom |volume=31 |issue=2 |date=February 1975 |pp=43–46 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Army sent Fitch to the Manhattan Project's [[Los Alamos Laboratory]] in New Mexico. By mid-1944, about a third of the technicians at Los Alamos were from the SED. While there, he met many of the greats of physics including [[Niels Bohr]], [[James Chadwick]], [[Enrico Fermi]], [[Isidor Isaac Rabi]], [[Bruno Rossi]], [[Emilio Segrè]], [[Edward Teller]] and [[Richard C. Tolman]], in some cases attending courses on physics taught by them. He worked in the group headed by [[Ernest Titterton]], a member of the [[British contribution to the Manhattan Project|British Mission]], and became well-acquainted with the techniques of [[experimental physics]]. He participated in the drop testing of mock [[atomic bomb]]s that was conducted at [[Wendover Army Air Field]] and the [[Salton Sea Naval Auxiliary Air Station]], and worked at the Trinity site, where he witnessed the [[Trinity nuclear test]] on July 16, 1945. He was discharged from the Army in 1946, but continued to work at Los Alamos as a civilian for another year in order to earn some money. He would briefly return to Los Alamos in summer 1948.&lt;ref name="autobio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Finn Aserud" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SED"/&gt;

==Academic career==
His wartime experiences led Fitch to decide to become a physicist. [[Robert Bacher]], the head of the physics division at Los Alamos, offered him a graduate assistantship at [[Cornell University]], but first he needed to complete his undergraduate degree. Rather than return to Northwestern or Carnegie Mellon, he elected to enter [[McGill University]], which Titterton had recommended. Fitch graduated from McGill with a bachelor's degree in [[electrical engineering]] in 1948. On the advice of Jerry Kellogg, who had been a student of Rabi's at [[Columbia University]], and was a division head at the Los Alamos, Fitch decided to pursue his doctoral studies at Columbia. Kellogg wrote him a letter of introduction to Rabi. [[James Rainwater]] became his academic supervisor. Rainwater gave him a paper by [[John Archibald Wheeler|John Wheeler]] concerning [[mu-mesic atom]]s, atoms in which an [[electron]] is replaced by a [[muon]]. These had never been observed; they were completely theoretical and there was no evidence that they existed, but it made a good thesis topic.&lt;ref name="autobio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Finn Aserud" /&gt;

Fitch designed and built an experiment to measure the [[gamma rays]] emitted from mu-mesic atoms. As it turned out, this was a good time to search for them. Columbia had recently commissioned a [[cyclotron]] at the [[Nevis Laboratories]] that could produce muons; [[Robert Hofstadter]] had developed the  thallium-activated sodium iodide gamma ray detector; and wartime advances in electronics yielded advances in components such as new [[phototube]]s needed to bring it all together. Initially nothing was found, but Rainwater suggested expanding the search beyond the energy range predicted by Wheeler on the basis of the then-accepted size of the radius of the [[atomic nucleus]] as around 1.4 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−15&lt;/sup&gt; m. When this was done, they found what they had been looking for, discovering in the process that the nucleus was closer to 1.2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−15&lt;/sup&gt; m.&lt;ref name="autobio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Finn Aserud" /&gt; He completed his [[Ph.D.]] in 1954, writing his thesis on "Studies of X-rays from mu-mesonic atoms".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://clio.columbia.edu/catalog/1563450 |title=Studies of X-rays from Mu-Mesonic atoms |year=1954 |publisher=[[Columbia University]] |accessdate=May 15, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The thesis was published in the ''[[Physical Review]]'' in November 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=[[Physical Review]] |title = Studies of X-Rays from Mu-Mesonic Atoms |last=Fitch |first=Val L. |last2=Rainwater |first2=James |volume = 92 |issue = 3 |pp=789–800 |date=November 1953  |publisher = American Physical Society |doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.92.789 |bibcode = 1953PhRv...92..789F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1949, Fitch married Elise Cunningham, a secretary who worked in the laboratory at Columbia. They had two sons. Elise died in 1972, and in 1976 he married Daisy Harper Sharp, thereby acquiring two stepdaughters and a stepson.&lt;ref name="NNDB"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nndb.com/people/838/000099541/ |title=Val Fitch |publisher=Soylent Communications |accessdate=May 15, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="New York Times"/&gt; After obtaining his doctorate, Fitch's interest shifted to [[strange particle]]s and [[K meson]]s. He took a position at [[Princeton University]], where he spent the rest of his career. He became a professor in 1960,  Fogg Brackett Professor in 1976, and McDonnell Distinguished University Professor of Physics in 1987, retaining this position until his retirement in 2005. He was chair of the Physics Department from 1976 to 1981.&lt;ref name="Princeton" /&gt;

Fitch conducted much of his research at the [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]], where he became acquainted with [[James Watson Cronin|James Cronin]]. The two of them played bridge at nights while they waited for the [[Cosmotron]] to become available. Cronin had built a new kind of detector, a [[spark chamber]] spectrometer, and Fitch realized that it would be perfect for experiments with [[K meson]]s (now known as kaons), which [[Yale University]] physicist [[Robert Adair (physicist)|Robert Adair]] had suggested had interesting properties worth investigating. They could decay into either matter or [[antimatter]]. Along with two colleagues, James Christenson and [[René Turlay]], they set up their experiment on the [[Alternating Gradient Synchrotron]] at Brookhaven. They discovered an unexpected result. The decay of neutral K mesons did not respect [[CP symmetry]]. K mesons that decayed into [[positron]]s did so faster than those that decayed into [[electron]]s.&lt;ref name="New York Times"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = Evidence for the 2π Decay of the K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; Meson |last=Christenson |first=J.

'''Dr Walter Thiel''' (March 3, 1910 [[Breslau]] – August 17, 1943 [[Karlshagen]], near [[Peenemünde]]) was a German [[rocket scientist]]. Walter Thiel provided the decisive ideas for the A4 ([[V-2 rocket|V-2]]) rocket engine and his research enabled rockets to head towards space.&lt;ref&gt;Thiel, K. and Przybilski, O.: Walter Thiel - Short life of a rocket scientist, 63rd International Astronautical Congress, Naples, Italy, IAC-12-E4-3B, October 4, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

Walter Erich Oskar Thiel was born on March 3, 1910 in the Silesian city of Breslau, as second son of Oskar Thiel (civil servant at the German Post) and Elsa (Prinz) Thiel.
In 1929 he passed all his school graduation exams (''Abitur'') with the highest possible grade A. After graduation he studied chemistry at the Technische Hochschule zu Breslau (now Wrocław University of Technology). Due to his excellent work he was exempt from study fees as of the third semester.

In summer semester of 1931 he passed the preliminary examination with excellence. In winter semester 1933 he passed all 7 diploma exams with the highest possible grade A and he became Dipl.-Ing. (chem.). In 1934 his thesis “Über die Addition von Verbindungen mit stark polarer Kohlenstoff-Halogenbindung an ungesättigte Kohlen-Wasserstoffe“&lt;ref group=note&gt;About the addition of compounds with highly polar carbon-halogen bonds to unsaturated hydrocarbons&lt;/ref&gt; received the highest possible honor (summa cum laude). He became Dr.-Ing. (chem.). His doctorate was confirmed on November 8, 1934 in Breslau (source: Walter Thiel’s doctorate).

Thiel's Professor in Breslau recommended Thiel to the Research Institute of the German army ordnance office of under-secretary Prof. Karl Erich Schumann at the University of Berlin. Thiel’s previous findings had technological applicability and therefore he was able to continue his fundamental research in a leading position. Late 1934 or early 1935 Thiel became research instructor at Reichswehrministerium. Schumann accompanied many diploma theses and dissertations, including that of [[Wernher von Braun]], who completed his dissertation in 1934. The contacts between the testing ground in [[Kummersdorf]] and Schumann’s Institute was close, the eastern part of the site in [[Kummersdorf]] served as an experimental base for Schumann’s institutes, in the west a group of scientists around Major [[Walter Dornberger]] carried out their experiments. Here Thiel got to know [[Walter Dornberger]] and [[Wernher von Braun]].

In autumn of 1936 Dornberger asked Thiel to move from fundamental research to Wa Prüf 11 at Kummersdorf’s western testing ground. All topics regarding the engine were assigned to Thiel, and he had to further advance the propulsion, which he managed in a very short time. In his paper “Empirische und theoretische Grundlagen zur Neuberechnung von Öfen und Versuchsdaten, Schießplatz Kummersdorf Vers. West“,&lt;ref group=note&gt;Empirical and theoretical fundamentals for the recalculation of furnace and experimental data, Kummersdorf Range West Test Station&lt;/ref&gt; that he presented on April 27, 1937, Thiel introduces developments that lead to decisive changes, including a shortening of the oven and an optimization of the injection nozzle. Furthermore, Thiel continued to research different fuel mixtures for the rocket engines.&lt;ref name=Neufeld&gt;{{cite book |last=Neufeld|first=Michael J|title=The Rocket and the Reich: Peenemünde and the Coming of the Ballistic Missile Era|year=1995|publisher=The Free Press|location=New York|isbn=|pages=56, 80, 84, 142, 157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937 the first scientists moved from [[Kummersdorf]] to [[Peenemünde]]. As the test stations were not ready yet, Thiel and his team stayed in [[Kummersdorf]] until 1940. After transferring from Kummersdorf to the [[Peenemünde]] Army Research Center in the summer of 1940, Thiel became deputy director of the [[Peenemünde#HVP Organization|Peenemünde HVP Organization]] under von Braun. In 1940 many new scientists were recruited in order to speed up the R&amp;D of the A4. Chemist Gerhard Heller became a very important co-worker of Thiel. They also established private contacts. Other colleagues of Thiel at the development unit included: Hermann M. Bedürftig, [[Konrad Dannenberg]], Werner Dobrick, [[Hans Fichtner]], Werner Gengelbach, Hans J. Lindenmayr, Dr. William A. Mrazek, Kurt E. Patt, Gerhard H. Reisig, Walther J. Riedel (Riedel III), [[Ludwig Roth]], Helmut Zoike. After the war, these scientists and others were recruited into United States-government service as part of [[Operation Paperclip]].

In the A4 project, the first successful launch occurred from test station VII on October 3, 1942. The rocket flew 190&amp;nbsp;km in the targeted direction and it reached a height of 85&amp;nbsp;km. The top-speed was 1,322&amp;nbsp;m/s. As the A4 was now showing military qualities, the NS leadership was demanding immediate implementation in war. Mass production replaced science, although the whole unit was still immature. There were many launch failures after October 3, 1942. In 1943 Thiel and many fellow scientists and researchers were very exhausted and unhappy in [[Peenemünde]]. Work overload, pressure to succeed and the changeover from a research unit to a production facility started to take its toll on the scientists. Thiel refused to declare the rocket engine ready for mass production. In a letter to von Braun, sent during a trip to a health farm, Thiel described the [[Aggregate (rocket family)|Aggregat 4]]: “…where it is more of a complicated lab product than a mass item….”. Thiel formulated his protest by handing in his resignation orally on August 17, 1943.&lt;ref name=Dornberger&gt;{{cite book |last=Dornberger|first=Walter|authorlink=Walter Dornberger|title=V2--Der Schuss ins Weltall|year=1952 -- US translation  ''V-2'' Viking Press:New York, 1954|publisher=Bechtle Verlag|location=Esslingan|language=German|isbn=|pages=27, 50, 53}}&lt;/ref&gt; He planned to get his professorship at a university. Dornberger rejected his resignation.

During the following night from August 17 to August 18, 1943 the Royal Air Force launched a bombing raid of Peenemünde, [[Operation Hydra (1943)|Operation ''Hydra'']]. The Thiel family died in a slit trench in front of their home in Karlshagen. It is very likely that a bomb hit the slit trench directly.{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=March 2017}} Thiel and his family (wife Martha, daughter Sigrid and son Siegfried) were buried at the war cemetery in Karlshagen. Martin Schilling replaced Thiel.&lt;ref name=Neufeld/&gt;

On 29 October 1944, Thiel was posthumously awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the War Merit Cross]] with Swords.

Thiel’s accomplishments were not forgotten. In 1970 a [[Thiel (crater)|moon crater]] is named after him. It is located on the far side of the moon and thus not visible from earth. (Coordinates: 40° 42’ N / 134° 30’ W, mean diameter: 32.0&amp;nbsp;km). In addition, Thiel was one of the first pioneers to be inducted in the “Space Hall of Fame” in Alamogordo, New Mexico, USA in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nmspacemuseum.org/halloffame/detail.php?id=24 International Space Hall of Fame :: New Mexico Museum of Space History :: Inductee Profile&lt;!-- bot-generated title --&gt;] at www.nmspacemuseum.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aggregate series Development==

Based on the '''film cooling''' ('veil cooling') solution identified by colleague Moritz Pöhlmann at [[Peenemünde]], Thiel designed annular rings of tiny perforations to inject unburnt fuel through the chamber walls at the throat for evaporative cooling to prevent [[V-2 rocket]] nozzle erosion.&lt;ref name=Neufeld/&gt;&lt;ref name=Klee&gt;{{cite book |last=Klee|first=Ernst|author2=Merk, Otto |title=The Birth of the Missile:The Secrets of Peenemünde|year=1963, English translation 1965|publisher=Gerhard Stalling Verlag|location=Hamburg|pages=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Collier&gt;{{cite book |last=Collier|first=Basil|title=The Battle of the V-Weapons, 1944-1945 |origyear=1964|year=1976|publisher=The Emfield Press|location=Yorkshire|isbn=0-7057-0070-4|pages=24, 91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By September 15, 1941, Thiel officially declared the basic eighteen-pot design of the A-4 motor finished.&lt;ref name=Neufeld/&gt;

Earlier in the Spring of 1941, Thiel began investigating nitric acid and diesel oil to be used as the fuel for the 30-ton-thrust [[Aggregate Series#A8|A-8]] .&lt;ref name=Neufeld/&gt;

Then on December 18, 1941, Thiel documented the initial [[Aggregate Series#A9|A-9/A-10]] motor design of six combustion chambers into one common nozzle in Secret Command Document 1496/41.&lt;ref name=Klee/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pocock&gt;{{cite book |last=Pocock|first=Rowland F|title=German Guided Missiles of the Second World War|year=1967|publisher=Arco Publishing Company, Inc.|location=New York|pages=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the middle of August 1943, Dr Thiel declared that the A-4 developmental problems preclude mass production, recommended the project be abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astronautix.com/astros/thialter.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-08-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110426045445/http://www.astronautix.com/astros/thialter.htm |archivedate=2011-04-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thiel also designed the motor for the [[Wasserfall]] anti-aircraft missile.

'''Winamac''' was the name of a number of [[Potawatomi]] leaders and warriors beginning in the late 17th century. The name derives from a man named Wilamet, a Native American from an eastern tribe who in 1681 was appointed to serve as a liaison between [[New France]] and the natives of the [[Lake Michigan]] region. Wilamet was adopted by the Potawatomis, and his name, which meant "Catfish" in his native [[Eastern Algonquian]] language, was soon transformed into "Winamac", which means the same thing in the [[Potawatomi language]]. The Potawatomi version of the name has been spelled in a variety of ways, including Winnemac, Winamek, and Winnemeg.

The Winamac name became associated with prominent members of the Fish clan of the Potawatomi tribe. In 1701, Winamac or Wilamet was a chief of the Potawatomi villages along the [[St. Joseph River (Lake Michigan)|St. Joseph River]] in what is now the U.S. state of [[Michigan]]. This man or another of the same name was an ally of New France who helped negotiate an end to the [[Fox Wars]] in the 1730s. Two other Winamacs were prominent during the [[War of 1812]]. One was active opponent of the United States, while the other was a U.S. ally. These two Winamacs have often been confused with each other.

== Wilamet ==
In 1681, a group of Native Americans from several [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] tribes of [[New England]] accompanied French explorer [[René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle]] on an expedition to the west.&lt;ref name="Clifton, 19-20"&gt;Clifton, 19-20.&lt;/ref&gt; One of these Natives, Wilamet (or Ouilamette or Wilamek), was appointed by La Salle to serve as a laison between [[New France]] and the natives of the [[Lake Michigan]] region.&lt;ref&gt;Clifton, 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Wilamet was adopted by the [[Potawatomi]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Susan Sleeper-Smith, ''Indian Women and French Men: Rethinking Cultural Encounter in the Western Great Lakes'' (Amherst: [[University of Massachusetts Press]], 2001), 175n35.&lt;/ref&gt; and his name, which meant "Catfish" in his native [[Eastern Algonquian]] language, was eventually transformed into "Winamac", which means the same thing in the [[Potawatomi language]].&lt;ref name="Clifton, 19-20"/&gt; Before long, he was recognized by the French as the "chief" of the Potawatomi villages along the [[St. Joseph River (Lake Michigan)|St. Joseph River]] in what is now the U.S. state of [[Michigan]].&lt;ref name="Clifton, 78"&gt;Clifton, 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilamet was therefore not a traditional Potawatomi leader (or ''okama''&lt;ref&gt;Clifton, 57.&lt;/ref&gt;), but was instead a "chief" appointed by the French.&lt;ref&gt;Clifton, 85-86.&lt;/ref&gt; French-appointed chiefs were a common feature of the [[Franco-Indian alliance]]. According to historian [[Richard White (historian)|Richard White]], "as the French singled out certain leaders to be the channels by which French power entered the villages, they created a new kind of chief which can best be distinguished as an alliance chief".&lt;ref&gt;White, 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilamet helped La Salle promote French policies while countering [[Iroquois]] influence in the Lake Michigan region.&lt;ref name="Clifton, 78"/&gt; In 1694, a man named Ouilamek, probably the same Wilamet, led 30 Potawatomis in an expedition under [[Antoine Laumet de La Mothe, sieur de Cadillac|Cadillac]] against the Iroquois.&lt;ref&gt;Clifton, 83.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1701, Wilamet and [[Onanghisse]] (or Onangizes), another prominent Potawatomi alliance chief,&lt;ref&gt;White, 39.&lt;/ref&gt; represented the Potawatomis at the great [[Treaty of Montreal]], which ended the war with the Iroquois.&lt;ref&gt;Clifton, 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Fox Wars]] (1712–1733), a Wilamek was a leader of the Fish clan of the St. Joseph Potawatomis.&lt;ref name="Clifton, 89"&gt;Clifton, 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian David Edmunds portrays this man as the same one who had attended the 1701 treaty, although Richard White writes that a Wilamek of this era was of a man of [[Sauk people|Sauk]] and [[Meskwaki]] (Fox) parentage who had married into the Potawatomi tribe.&lt;ref&gt;White, 171.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1719, Wilamek traveled to Montreal with a group of Meskwaki leaders in an effort to make peace.&lt;ref name="Clifton, 89"/&gt; The following year, his son was captured by the Meskwakis, but he was later released.&lt;ref&gt;Clifton, 89; Edmunds, 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

==War of 1812 era==
{{further|Indiana in the War of 1812|Illinois Territory in the War of 1812}}
During the [[War of 1812]] era, the Potawatomis, like other tribes, were divided over whether to oppose the expansion of the United States or to seek peaceful accommodation. Two men named Winamac were prominent in this era. One was an active opponent of the United States, while the other became a U.S. ally. These two men have often been confused with each other.&lt;ref name="Edmunds, 307n66"&gt;Edmunds, 307n66.&lt;/ref&gt; American historians have often distinguished them by referring to the "anti-American" or "hostile" Winamek and the "pro-American" or "friendly" Winamek.&lt;ref&gt;Clifton, 528; Edmunds, 307n66.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-American Winamac===
The "anti-American" Winamac was a Potawatomi leader who first appears in the historical record in 1810. That year, while returning from an unsuccessful raid against the [[Osage people|Osages]], Winamac's party stole horses from some white Illinois settlers. The settlers pursued the raiders, and the Potawatomis attacked, killing four men. Governor [[Ninian Edwards]] demanded that the Potawatomis surrender the raiders, but chief [[Chief Gomo|Gomo]] informed U.S. officials that the raiders had gone to [[Prophetstown (village)|Prophetstown]] in Indiana, headquarters of the anti-American resistance movement led by the [[Tenskwatawa|Shawnee Prophet]] and his brother [[Tecumseh]].&lt;ref&gt;Edmunds, 172-73.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with chiefs [[Shabbona]] and [[Waubonsie]], Winamac led the Potawatomi contingent against the Americans at the [[Battle of Tippecanoe]] at Prophetstown in 1811.&lt;ref&gt;Edmunds, 177.&lt;/ref&gt;

Winamac began the organization for the 1812 [[siege of Fort Wayne]]. Late in August, Winamac called together a war party from northern Indiana and Michigan. First attempting to convince Captain Rhea of their friendly intent, they sought entry to the post. Rebuffed, on August 28, 1812 the warriors killed a clerk who left the post for the Ohio.  What followed were occasional firing of outbuildings and shots aimed at any and all movement seen from the outside. On September 4, Winamac approached under a flag of truce.  Making no offer, Winamac found the fort susceptible to attack. The next day, two soldiers were killed outside the fort.  Late in the afternoon, Winamac approached the fort with a small delegation and sought admittance to see the commander.  Inside, they were heavily guarded, ending their ploy to kill the commander and attack from inside. The following day, September 6, saw the greatest action in the siege, but without help, the fort could not be taken. On September 11, a relief column under Governor Harrison arrived from Piqua and the siege ended.

After the siege of Fort Wayne, Winamac served as a scout under British Indian agent [[Matthew Elliott (loyalist)|Matthew Elliott]]. On November 22, 1812, Winamac was with a scouting party that captured several Indians, including Shawnee chief Logan ([[Spemica Lawba]]), a U.S. ally. Winamac was killed in an exchange of gunfire when Logan and his companions escaped; Logan died later from his wounds.&lt;ref&gt;Edmunds, 192.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pro-American Winamac===
The "pro-American" Winamek was a chief from the Tippecanoe Potawatomi on the Wabash.  Beginning in 1807 he and [[Five Medals]] and [[Topinabee (I)|Topinabee]] continued to ask the American government for agricultural help.  The equipment that was sent was never used, as only these chiefs were interested in agriculture, not their people.  In 1807, President Monroe wanted to acquire more Indian land.  A council was called at [[Fort Wayne]] in September.  Winamac led the Potawatomi delegation. When the other chiefs and the Miami refused to negotiate land cessions, it was Winamac who persuaded first the Miami and then the Potawatomi to agree to the cession.  When {{convert|3|e6acre|km2}} were agreed to, none were lands of the Potawatomi.  Winamac and the Potawatomi received a generous share of the payment for these lands.  The months following the treaty found Winamac at Detroit settling disputes for the lands in northwest Ohio.  Because of the Fort Wayne Treaty, discontent was growing and the number of warriors at Prophetstown was increasing.  Winamac provide information to Governor Harrison on the plans and activities at Prophetstown.  Harrison invited the Prophet to Washington and in June, Tecumseh led a delegation to Vincennes to meet with Harrison.  Here, [[Tecumseh]] denounced Winamac as a 'black dog' for supporting the American interests.&lt;ref name=McPherson&gt;'''Indian Names in Indiana''' by Alan McPherson, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the winter of 1811-1812, Potawatomi raids were launched against settlements in southern Indiana and Illinois.  To end the destruction, councils where held at [[Cahokia]] and [[Vincennes, Indiana|Vincennes]]. Winamac and Five Medals assured the agents that the few anti-American warriors were not representative of the Potawatomi. Because of the influence of the pro-British chiefs, Winamac and Five Medals refused a trip to Washington. Tecumseh the [[Shawnee]] spoke at the council blaming Winamac and Five Medals for not controlling their warriors.  When [[William Henry Harrison|Gov. Harrison]] marched north to [[Prophetstown State Park|Prophetstown]] on the [[Tippecanoe River|Tippecanoe]] in November 1811, Winamac marched with him.  When they were a short march from Prophetstown, Winamac went ahead to talk with the Prophet.  Winamac returned south to meet Harrison, but was on the far side of the Wabash and passed him by.  On the night of November 6, Gov. Harrison encamped for the night, planning on entering Prophetstown the next day.  When the sun rose, the confederacy had surrounded the troops.  The Potawatomi were led by [[Shabbona]] with [[Waubonsie|Waubansee]] and Winamac (2nd another chief among the Potawatomi).  The defeat of the Indian confederacy scattered the tribes to their home villages.  The dispersal of the Indian confederacy did not end the raids among the settlements.  Tension was so bad, even Winamac was warned to stay out of the settlements.  His unfailing support of the Americans would not protect him from harm.&lt;ref name="McPherson"/&gt;

When the war between the United States and England was known, Winamac continued to support the Americans and led a delegation to the Lake Peoria villages seeking the warriors accused of raiding the settlements.  He was ridiculed by the Potawatomi warriors and left unsuccessful. It was Winamac who carried William Hulls orders from Detroit to Fort Dearborn (Chicago) to evacuate, an attack was eminent. Winamac told Commander Heald that they must leave that day to save themselves, this was on August 9. On August 13, an escort of 13 Miami Indians arrived.  On August 15, Mad Sturgeon and Blackbird led the Potawatomi ambush of 500+ warriors against the 62 soldiers and 27 civilians in the dunes of Lake Michigan.  Fifty-three of the Americans died that day. Fifteen of the Indians died.&lt;ref name="McPherson"/&gt; [[Fort Dearborn]] fell on August 15, 1812 to an ambush, then Mackinac. These were followed by the siege of Detroit, which surrendered to the British on August 16.

In September 1817, Winamac and [[Metea]] represented the eastern Potawatomis at the [[treaty of Fort Meigs]], in which they sold lands in Ohio and south central Michigan to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Edmunds, 219.&lt;/ref&gt; Winamac died in 1821.&lt;ref name="Edmunds, 307n66"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
The Lord is my shepherd;
I have everything I need.
He lets me see a country of justice and peace
And directs my steps towards this land.
He gives me power.
He guides me in the paths of victory,
As he has promised
Even if a full scale violent confrontation breaks out 
I will not be afraid, Lord, 
For you are with me. 
Your shepherd's power and love protect me. 
You prepare me for my freedom,
Where all my enemies can see it;
You welcome me as an honoured guest
And fill my cup with righteousness and peace.
I know that your goodness and love
Will be with me all my life; and your liberating love will be my home
As long as I live.&lt;ref name=Pocket /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ejikeme&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ejikeme|first1=Anene|title=Culture and Customs of Namibia|date=2011|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|page=62|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MSLyZhzAmTAC&amp;pg=PA62|accessdate=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
