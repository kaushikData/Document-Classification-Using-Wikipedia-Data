The '''Chesterfield by-election, 1984''' was [[by-election|held]] on 1 March 1984 for a seat in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]] to represent [[Chesterfield (UK Parliament constituency)|Chesterfield]] in [[Derbyshire]]. This followed the [[Resignation from the British House of Commons|resignation]] of the sitting [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) [[Eric Varley]]. 

The eventual winner, former Labour [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|cabinet minister]] [[Tony Benn]] (who had been ousted from parliament at the general election nine months earlier) defeated sixteen other candidates, at the time the largest fielded in a British by-election &amp;mdash; surpassing the previous high of twelve, at the [[Croydon North West by-election, 1981]]. This record would remain unbroken until the [[Newbury by-election, 1993]].

At the time, there was no requirement for political parties fielding candidates to be registered, resulting in some fringe candidates using slogans or frivolous titles as their party name. Actor [[Bill Maynard]] finished in fourth place, standing as an "independent Labour" supporter who opposed Benn's candidacy. Other candidates included: John Davey, who ran in opposition to increases in the charges for [[National Health Service|NHS]] [[dentistry]], Helen Anscomb, a by-election veteran who called for [[freight]] to be transported by [[Rail transport|rail]] to improve [[road safety]], Donald Butler, a furniture shop owner who adopted the slogan "a [[Chesterfield sofa|Chesterfield]] for [[Chesterfield]]", T. A Layton stood in the name of the "Spare the Earth Ecology Party", which he had founded, and David Cahill campaigned for ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' to be treated as a [[Comics|comic]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.election.demon.co.uk/1983EB.html ALDRIDGE-BROWNHILLS to LEEDS, WEST, 1983 to 1997 election results] at election.demon.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

Chesterfield was Benn's fourth by-election victory. He had first entered [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] at the [[Bristol South East by-election, 1950]] and held that seat until he was disqualified from the [[British House of Commons|Commons]] in 1960, when he inherited a peerage, as [[Viscount Stansgate]], upon his father's death. At the resulting [[Bristol South East by-election, 1961|Bristol South East by-election 1961]], he won with an increased majority of votes, but because he was ineligible to take his seat, the Conservative candidate [[Malcolm St. Clair (UK politician)|Malcolm St Clair]] was declared elected. When the law was changed to allow peerages to be renounced, St Clair resigned the seat and Benn won the [[Bristol South East by-election, 1963|Bristol South East by-election 1963]].

[[File:BCN-ParcForum-4923.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of the 2004 Universal Forum of Cultures]]
The '''2004 Universal Forum of Cultures''' - ({{lang-ca|Fòrum Universal de les Cultures}}, {{lang-es|Fórum Universal de las Culturas}}) was a 141-day international event that took place in the ''Centre de Convencions Internacional de Barcelona (CCIB)'' and its surrounding venues, [[Barcelona]], [[Spain]] from May 9 to September 26, 2004, and was the first edition of the [[Universal Forum of Cultures]]. The open space used by the event is now a public park called the '''Parc del Fòrum'''.

==History==
[[File:Fòrum Universal 2004 - 30.JPG|thumb|Show "L'Arbre de la Memòria" by Els Comediants, during the 2004 Universal Forum of Cultures]]
The 2004 Universal Forum of Cultures was organized by Barcelona's city council, the regional government (the Generalitat de Catalunya), the Spanish National Government and [[UNESCO]]. It was conceived by its prime mover ([[Pasqual Maragall]], then Mayor of Barcelona) as a way of promoting the city's burgeoning tourist industry in the wake of the [[1992 Summer Olympics|1992 Olympic Games]], which were also held in Barcelona. The forum was also politically useful, given the mayor's earlier failure to deliver on a 1996 promise to secure an international exposition for the city.

The official aims of the 2004 Universal Forum of Cultures included support for peace, sustainable development, human rights and respect for diversity.

[[File:Michael-Gorbatchov-ABr.jpg|thumb|[[Mikhail Gorbachev]] at the  2004 Universal Forum of Cultures]]
The forum hosted more than 40 international conventions (participants included [[Juan Antonio Samaranch]], [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], [[José Saramago]], [[Felipe González]], [[Rigoberta Menchú]], [[Angelina Jolie]], [[Robert McNamara]], [[Valéry Giscard d'Estaing]], [[Lionel Jospin]], [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]], [[Romano Prodi]] and [[Salman Rushdie]], among others), performances, markets, games, 423 concerts, 57 street performances, 44 theatre, dance and cabaret companies, 20 circus acts and over 20 exhibitions.

[[Josep Acebillo]] was named Director for Architecture and Infrastructures of the Forum. The events were held at the eastern end of [[Avinguda Diagonal]], a main cross-city artery. The seaside area was developed to house the event. It covered 30 hectares between the Barcelona Olympic port and [[Sant Adrià de Besòs]], and culminated the urban regeneration programme started for the 1992 Olympics. The new site comprises a convention center, central plaza, parks, auditoriums, a new port and a [[Forum Building]] (designed by architectural firm [[Herzog &amp; de Meuron]]).

In the framework of this Forum, the 4th Porto Alegre Forum of Local Authorities for Social Inclusion was held, which approved the [[Agenda 21 for culture]] on 8 May 2004.

== Exhibitions ==

The forum showed four thematic exhibitions, intended to achieve a renewal of ideas and attitudes toward the 21st century, by undertaking a careful analysis of cultural diversity, sustainable development and the conditions for peace:

* '''Voices'''. An exhibit (designed by [[Ralph Appelbaum Associates]], creative direction by [[Mona Kim]][https://web.archive.org/web/20110710184244/http://www-org.elpais.com/articulo/cataluna/Vicenc/Villatoro/defiende/exposicion/Voces/tiene/ideas/politicas/explicitas/elpepiespcat/20040505elpcat_21/Tes?print=1]) of the world's [[languages]] to celebrate human communication and linguistic and cultural diversity.
* '''Inhabiting the World'''. A study about how humankind relates to the planet's environment. It showed the need to adopt a more rational criteria for the use of natural resources on a planetary scale. It also showed [[Earth]]'s natural diversity, and the effect caused by human activity, specifically by the phenomenon of urbanization. Finally, exposed the huge consumption and waste production by [[Western world|Western society]].
* '''Cities-Corners'''. A study about how cities are built. It included models about well known streets and building from the world ([[Piccadilly Circus]] in [[London]], [[Times Square]] or the [[Flatiron Building]] in [[New York City]], [[La Pedrera]] in [[Barcelona]], etc.) and maps showing how some cities grew. It also showed about the growing of megacities, like [[Bombay]], [[Mexico City]], [[Monterrey]], [[Cairo]] or [[Istanbul]].
* '''Warriors of Xi'an'''. An exhibition of Chinese [[funerary art]], based on archaeological finds at the tombs of [[Qinshihuang]] and [[Yangling]]. Among the pieces displayed, there was an exhibit of [[Terracotta Army|terracotta warriors of Xi'an]] from the [[Qin Dynasty]].

==Controversy==

[[Image:Photovoltaic.JPG|thumb|Sculptural photovoltaic plate in Forum area]]
The broad business concept shaping the forum was largely drawn up by [[ESADE]]. The link between the forum's commercial sponsors and the business school can readily be appreciated by comparing the companies listed on  ESADE's Board of Trustees and those featured on the forum's web site. The strong business orientation apparent in the organization of the event gave rise to considerable local controversy in both the run-up to the forum and during the event itself. Several NGOs argued that they were frozen out of the decision-making process as the original Forum concept was radically altered to cater to corporate interests.

The campaign against the forum took many forms. One of the biggest demonstrations consisted of a seaborne invasion by anti-Forum protesters [http://rotorrr.org/paterasurbanas/doss_prensa/] landing in makeshift rafts. This dealt a serious blow to the event's carefully groomed media image, particularly when Jordi Oliveras, the forum's Director-General was kicked by a demonstrator and Miquel Miró, the Director of Operations, was hit over the head by one of the forum's security guards. The "invasion" was widely reported in the press, despite the fact that major newspapers, radio and television stations had been co-opted into the forum under a special media consortium agreement.

The choice of some speakers at the forum's "dialogues" also sparked protest. An article in one of Catalonia's mass circulation dailies argued that [[Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada]] (former President of Bolivia and a keynote speaker at a Forum conference on development problems in South America) was a less than ideal choice. Lozada had a major stake in Bolivia's highly polluting Potosi mine and the previous year had taken a flight to Miami while the Bolivian military machine-gunned striking miners at home.

The forum also attracted the ire of demonstrators when the organizers refused to condemn the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The fact that several of the forum's sponsors had significant stakes in the arms industry further exacerbated protests.

Critics pointed to the $2.3 billion price tag and commercial sponsorship by multinationals ENDESA, [[Nestlé]], [[Coca-Cola]], [[Telefónica]], and [[Indra Sistemas|Indra]] with dubious reputations in the [[Third World]]. Several groups also criticised the massive property and coastline destruction involved in building the forum site. In addition, many [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs), including [[Greenpeace]] and [[Amnesty International]], withdrew from the forum project in protest. This may explain why the forum fell so far short of its projected attendance figures for the 141-day event. The forum expected 5 million visitors but the official final attendance figure was around 3.5 million. Independent estimates of attendance were significantly lower.

==The place today==
The central plaza and the open space surrounding forms a public area called Parc del Fòrum, and is now home to several massive events around the year, including the [[Primavera Sound Festival]], [[Summercase]], the [[Catalonia April Fair]] and the most popular concerts in [[La Merce|La Mercè]].

'''General elections''' are scheduled to be held in [[Panama]] on 5 May 2019.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.electionguide.org/countries/id/167/ Panama] IFES&lt;/ref&gt; Due to [[Constitution of Panama|constitutional term limits]], [[Incumbent]] [[President of Panama|President]] [[Juan Carlos Varela]] will be ineligible for a second consecutive term.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tribunal-electoral.gob.pa/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/DECRETO-22-Y-23-DEL-5-DE-MAYO-DE-2018.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electoral system==
Of the 71 members of the [[National Assembly (Panama)|National Assembly]], 26 will be elected in single-member constituencies and 45 by proportional representation in multi-member constituencies. Each [[Districts of Panama|district]] with more than 40,000 inhabitants forms a constituency. Constituencies elect one MP for every 30,000 residents and an additional representative for every fraction over 10,000.&lt;ref name=IPU&gt;[http://www.ipu.org/parline-e/reports/2245_B.htm Electoral system] IPU&lt;/ref&gt;

In single-member constituencies MPs are elected using the [[first-past-the-post voting|first-past-the-post system]]. In multi-member constituencies MPs are elected using party list [[proportional representation]] according to a double quotient; the first allocation of seats uses a simple quotient, further seats are allotted using the quotient divided by two, with any remaining seats are awarded to the parties with the greatest remainder.&lt;ref name=IPU/&gt;

'''Adrian Legg''' is an English guitar player who has been called "impossible to categorize".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Guitar |last=Chapman |first=Richard |authorlink= |author2= |year=2005 |publisher=DK Publishing |location= |isbn=0-7566-0945-3 |page= |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P_olAAAACAAJ |quote=Impossible to categorize as a player, Adrian Legg incorporates virtually every genre on his guitar in a virtuosic instrumental style with effects. He brought electric approaches to acoustic playing, creating a modern cross-over amalgamation in the tradition of eclectic folk playing that goes back to the 1960s.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He plays custom guitars that are a hybrid of electric and [[Acoustic guitar|acoustic]], and his [[Fingerstyle guitar|fingerstyle]] picking technique has been acknowledged by the readers of ''[[Guitar Player]]'' who voted Legg the "best acoustic fingerstyle" player four years in a row (1993–1996).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20010125080900/http://adrianlegg.com/reviews.htm Interview with Chris Fetters] for [http://www.whatsup-magazine.com/ What's Up!] magazine, Walla Walla Washington.&lt;/ref&gt;

From his early start as a bench technician customising electric guitars, Legg moved into guitar instruction, publishing books and videos on guitar technique. In 1996 and 1997, Legg shared the stage with acclaimed guitar experts [[Joe Satriani]], [[Eric Johnson]] and [[Steve Vai]] as part of the [[G3 (tour)|G3 tour]]. Vai called Legg "Uncle Adrian"&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20041019073531/http://www.adrianlegg.com/Archives/SleeveNotes/GB.htm Adrian Legg. Archives. Sleeve Notes. ''Guitar Bones – Adrian Legg''.] Retrieved 3 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and Satriani said of Legg's musicianship "He's simply the best acoustic guitar player I've ever heard. I don't know anyone else who can create such a cascade of beautiful notes... Adrian plays like he's got hammers for fingers."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20010125081300/http://adrianlegg.com/quotes.htm Guitar magazine, October 1997. ''Joe Satriani.''] Retrieved 3 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==
[[File:Adrian legg.jpg|thumb|left|upright=.75|Legg at the Hare and Hounds pub in North London, 27 March 1987]]
Legg was born 16 May 1948 in [[Hackney Central|Hackney]], east London. He studied the [[oboe]] as a child but in teenage years his interest shifted to the guitar.

In the early 1970s, Legg won both the composition and performance sections of a competition run by the now defunct Guitar magazine, published by Musical New Services of Denmark Street, which led to his being asked to contribute articles to the magazine.  From then on, his technical flair produced a stream of articles in UK music press in the 1970s and early 1980s, culminating in the Kaye and Ward book "Customising Your Electric Guitar", 1981. He spent from 1979 to 1981 as a technician at Rose Morris Ltd., who then handled Marshall amplification, [[Ovation Guitar]] and [[Takamine Guitars]], and designed original and well-reviewed passive circuits for the then relaunched Vox guitars. In 1990, he was involved in the prototyping and launch of the highly successful Trace Acoustic amplifiers, and continues to maintain technical relationships with the musical instrument industry.

From a 1983 promotional flyer (Technopickers) from Spindrift Records; Having demonstrated Ovation guitar for a number of years and with sessions with Tom Robinson, a tour with Richard Thompson and appearing on Radio One's in Concert programme all have helped established Adrian.

==Going global==
Legg's first US release, ''Guitars and Other Cathedrals'' in 1990, pleased guitar fans. Over the years, he's played at the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]] and toured with Richard Thompson, David Lindley, Joe Satriani, Eric Johnson and as part of the G3 Tour featuring Satriani, Johnson and [[Favored Nations]] founder [[Steve Vai]].&lt;ref name=LeggPress/&gt; For G3, Legg served as an opening act in 1996 and a headlining act in 1997. An infrequent singer, Legg helped with vocal duties on the collaborative G3 performance of [[Red House (song)|''Red House'']] by [[Jimi Hendrix]].

He's also shared the wealth of his talent and experience with teaching DVDs, videos and books. In recent years, he has also been a commentator-at-large for National Public Radio's "All Things Considered", and even more recently, regular listeners have heard his guitar versions of the show's theme music.&lt;ref name=LeggPress&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20000623213929/http://www.adrianlegg.com/press_page.htm Adrian Legg. ''Press Page''.] Retrieved 3 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style==
[[File:Adrian Legg in Spain 2006.jpg|thumb|Legg performing at the ''Auditorio Maestro Padilla'' in [[Almería, Spain]], 18 July 2006]]
Legg plays [[fingerstyle guitar]], mixing an [[alternating-bass]] style with [[harmonics]], banjo-peg retuning and single or double-string bending. Often he will play a piece entirely in [[arpeggios]] similar to a classical guitar style. He makes extensive use of altered tunings and [[capo]]s.

Legg has said that his true home is onstage. "Playing live is the whole point... Everyone makes a journey, an effort; we all come together – me, the audience, the people who run the venue – to share this wonderful, universal, human emotional interaction. This is where music lives."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20041011191729/http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/news.php?id=4060 All About Jazz. News. ''Favored Nations Acoustic Delivers Adrian Legg’s “Inheritance”''. August 24, 2004.] Retrieved 3 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant part of a performance by Legg is the wryly funny storytelling patter he uses between songs, some of these stories included on ''Adrian Legg Live'' (2017). His distinctive wit is also in written evidence everywhere from his liner notes to his tablature books.

Legg included the use of modeling technology and [[MIDI]] for fingerstyle guitar on his 2004 album ''Inheritance'', which features extensive use of [[Guitar synthesizer|guitar synthesisers]] and modeled guitar sounds. This stands in contrast to the more acoustic sound of ''Guitar Bones''.

In an interview with Frets, a Guitar Player publication, Adrian listed some of the signal processors and effects that he utilizes to shape his acoustic tone.  This included several notable effects boxes such as the [[Effectrode]] PC-2A compressor, a [[Wampler|Wampler Pedals]] Black '65 Overdrive, and an [[Effeectrode]] Helios fuzz.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nxtbook.com/nxtbooks/newbay/frets_201502/#/6|title=Frets - February 2015|website=www.nxtbook.com|access-date=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adrian is also endorsed by [[Neunaber Audio]] and is currently using a [[Neunaber Audio]] Immerse Reverberator for his reverb needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://neunaber.net/pages/adrian-legg|title=Adrian Legg|website=Neunaber Audio|access-date=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Alice Dollar'' incident''' was an affair involving a [[United States]]-flagged [[merchant ship]] and an American warship in 1920. [[China|Chinese]] [[rebellion|rebel]]s along the [[Yangtze River]] attacked the SS [[Robert Dollar|''Alice Dollar'']] on July 20, so the [[gunboat]] {{USS|Monocacy|PG-20|6}} was assigned to escort the vessel out of the area. On the following day, during the operation, rebels attacked again but were silenced by American counter-fire.&lt;ref name=tolley&gt;Tolley, p. 88–89.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incident==
The ''Alice Dollar'', of the [[Dollar Line]], was steaming upriver to the [[treaty port]] of [[Tang Chia To, China|Tang Chia To]] in the day of July 20 when armed Chinese rebels, belonging to a local [[warlord]], opened fire on the ship with [[small arms]]. The Americans were able to increase their speed and escape to port with minor damage and no casualties. [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] C. D. Gilroy, of USS ''Monocacy'', was informed of the situation and asked to escort the merchant ship back down the river on the next day, July 21. While only four miles off [[Chongqing|Chungking]], Chinese rebels along the river again attacked from the north bank of the Yangtze. Due to other related [[USS Monocacy incident|incidents]] in the past, the crews of ''Monocacy''{{'}}s [[M1919 Browning machine gun|{{convert|.30|in|mm|2|abbr=on}}]] [[machine gun]]s and {{convert|6|in|mm|abbr=on}} [[cannon]]s were immediately ordered to return fire.&lt;ref name=tolley/&gt;

Within just a few minutes and after firing six shells, the Chinese were in retreat but {{convert|.5|mi|km|abbr=on}} downriver, they attacked once more. The Americans again returned fire and shot several more shells and hundred of bullets into the surrounding hills, forcing the rebels to abandon their attempt. Captain Gilroy estimated that his ship was fired on 600 times though only 15 bullet holes were counted and two men were slightly wounded. After the affair, the U.S. consul in Chungking demanded and received a Chinese apology but no restitution was requested.&lt;ref name=tolley/&gt;

[[File:Aoix2.jpg|thumb|right|Man carrying a hollyhock float]]

The {{nihongo|'''Aoi Matsuri'''|葵祭}}, or "[[Hollyhock]] Festival," is one of the three main annual [[Japanese festivals|festivals]] held in [[Kyoto]], [[Japan]], the other two being [[Jidai Matsuri|the Festival of the Ages]] (Jidai Matsuri) and the [[Gion Matsuri|Gion Festival]]. It is a festival of the two Kamo shrines in the north of the city, [[Shimogamo Shrine]] and [[Kamigamo Shrine]]. The festival may also be referred to as the '''Kamo Festival'''. It is held on 15 May of each year.

==History==
[[File:Saio dai Roto-nogi 20160515.JPG|thumb|left|Saio Dai leaving Kyoto Emperor's palace]]
According to the ancient historical record known as the ''[[Nihon Shoki]]'', the festival originated during the reign of [[Emperor Kinmei]] (reigned CE 539 - 571). The ancient records known as the ''Honchō getsurei'' (本朝月令) and ''Nenchūgyōji hissho'' (年中行事秘抄) reveal that a succession of disastrous rains with high winds ruined the grain crops, and epidemics had spread through the country. Because diviners placed the cause on divine punishment by the [[Kamo Shrine|Kamo deities]], the Emperor sent his messenger with a retinue to the shrine to conduct various acts to appease the deities, in prayer for a bountiful harvest. These included riding a galloping horse.&lt;ref name="kaiyu.omiki.com"&gt;http://kaiyu.omiki.com/mioya/mioya.html&lt;/ref&gt;

This became an annual ritual, and the galloping horse performance developed into an [[Yabusame|equestrian archery]] performance. According to the historical record known as the ''[[Zoku Nihongi]]'' (続日本記）, so many people had come to view this equestrian performance on the festival day in the 2nd year of the reign of [[Emperor Monmu]] (r. 697–707) that the event was banned.&lt;ref name="kaiyu.omiki.com" /&gt;

In the ninth century, [[Emperor Kanmu]] established the seat of the [[Chrysanthemum Throne|imperial throne]] in Kyoto. This represented the beginning of the [[Heian period]] in Japanese history. Emperor Kanmu recognized the deities of the Kamo shrines as protectors of the Heian capital, and established the Aoi Matsuri as an annual imperial event.&lt;ref name=aoi&gt;Aoi, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The festival saw its peak of grandeur in the middle of the Heian Period, but this waned in the [[Kamakura period]] and the following [[Muromachi period]], and as the nation entered the [[Sengoku period]], the festival procession was discontinued. In the [[Genroku]] era (1688–1704) of the [[Edo period]], it was revived, but in the 2nd year of the [[Meiji period]] (1869), when the capital was moved from Kyoto to [[Tokyo]], observance of the festival procession stopped. In Meiji-17 (1885), it was again revived as part of a government plan to enliven Kyoto. All but the rituals at the shrine fronts were discontinued from 1944, due to [[World War II]]. At last, the festival procession started to be held again from 1953. The Saiō-Dai festival princess tradition was initiated in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kyoto-np.co.jp/kp/koto/aoi/arekore/kigen.html Kyoto Shimbun web page about the Aoi Festival (Japanese)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417063352/http://kyoto-np.co.jp/kp/koto/aoi/arekore/kigen.html |date=April 17, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The festival has been called Aoi festival for the [[hollyhock]] leaves used as decoration throughout the celebration. These leaves were once believed to protect against natural disasters.&lt;ref name=frang&gt;Frang, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==Festival events==
[[File:Saio Dai and Women parade 2015.JPG|thumb|Saiō-Dai and women parade]]
There are two parts to Aoi Matsuri: the procession and the shrine rites.&lt;ref name=frang/&gt;  The procession is led by the Imperial Messenger.  Following the imperial messenger are: two oxcarts, four cows, thirty-six horses, and six hundred people,&lt;ref name=frang/&gt; all of which are dressed in traditional Heian period apparel decorated with aoi leaves.&lt;ref name=frang/&gt;  The procession starts at 10:30 on May 15 and leaves the [[Kyoto Imperial Palace]] and slowly works its way towards the Shimogamo shrine and finally the Kamigamo shrine.&lt;ref name=shively&gt;Shively, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;  When they finally arrive at both shrines, the Saiō-Dai and Imperial Messenger perform their rituals.  The Saiō-Dai simply pays her respects to the deities and the Imperial Messenger intones the imperial rescript praising the deities and requesting their continued favor.&lt;ref name=shively/&gt;

There are two main figures in the Aoi Matsuri: the Saiō-Dai and the Imperial Messenger.&lt;ref name=aoi/&gt;  The Saiō-Dai is a woman who is chosen from the sisters and daughters of the Emperor to dedicate herself to the Shimogamo shrine.   The role of Saiō-Dai was to maintain ritual purity and to represent the Emperor at the festival.  Now, the role of the Saiō-Dai is played by an unmarried woman in Kyoto.&lt;ref name=aoi/&gt;   She is dressed in the traditional style of the Heian court.  Traditional Heian court dress for women would be wearing several layers of exquisitely colored silk robes.&lt;ref&gt;Layered, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;  The Saiō-Dai wears twelve layers of the traditional style robes ([[jūnihitoe]]).&lt;ref&gt;(Shimogamo, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;  To maintain ritual purity, the Saiō-Dai goes through several ceremonies of purification before the procession of the festival.  The Imperial Messenger leads the festival procession on horseback.&lt;ref name=aoi/&gt;   During the Heian period he would be a Fifth-Rank courtier holding the office of middle or lesser captain and was usually a man destined for high office.&lt;ref name=shively/&gt;  His role was to read the imperial rescript of the shrines and present the emperor’s offerings.&lt;ref name=shively/&gt;  During the Heian period, the Saiō-Dai and the Imperial messenger would be accompanied by ten dancers and twelve musicians.&lt;ref name=shively/&gt;

Also featured at the ''Kamo no matsuri'' are horse races (''kurabe-uma''),&lt;ref&gt;[http://eos.kokugakuin.ac.jp/modules/xwords/entry.php?entryID=1015  ''"Kurabe-uma,"''] ''Encyclopedia of Shinto; n.b., this link incorporates streaming video of a horse race at [[Kamo Shrine]].&lt;/ref&gt; and demonstrations of [[mounted archery]] ([[yabusame]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://kaiwai.city.kyoto.jp/raku/backnum/may07_e/buttone3.html  ''"Aoi matsuri,"''] Kyoto City Tourism and Culture Information System.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
In her review of the New York Musical Theatre Festival production, Anita Gates of the ''New York Times'' wrote: "This production has rousing songs, big voices, stylish staging and choreography, first-rate lighting and handsome period costumes. And framing it with the radio bulletins of Walter Winchell (Michael Thomas Holmes), the celebrity-gossip king of his day, was a smart idea."&lt;ref&gt;http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/18/new-york-musical-theater-festival-report-baby-case/?_r=0&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Huffington Post'' review wrote: "We were both overwhelmed by Ogborn's wit, juxtaposition of historical elements, his range of you-can't-keep-your-toes-from-tapping syncopation, his you-actually-walk-out-humming-them melodies and his handling of a complex and complicated subject...a cut above the original. Director Jeremy Dobrish deserves an E for Exceptionallly Excellent for his revisions."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/myra-chanin/michael-ogborn_b_1698552.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards and nominations ==
The musical received 4 [[Barrymore Awards for Excellence in Theater]] in 2002, including Best Musical.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theatrephiladelphia.org/barrymore-awards/2002&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, it received 4 NYMF awards in 2012, including Best of Fest.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.playbill.com/news/article/a-letter-to-harvey-milk-and-baby-case-lead-nymf-awards-for-excellence-196162&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Berlin Wintergarten theatre''' was a large [[Music hall|variety theatre]] in [[Mitte (locality)|Berlin-Mitte]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.berlin.de/tickets/theater/tipps/buehnen/2225303-2903274-wintergarten-variete.html Berlin.de]&lt;/ref&gt;

It opened in 1887 and was destroyed by bombs in June 1944.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/the-wintergarten-theatre-in-berlin-germany-circa-1926-it-news-photo/152448311 Getty Images]&lt;/ref&gt;

The name was taken on by a theatre in Potsdamer Strasse in 1992.

The [[Max Skladanowsky|Skladanowsky brothers]] showcased the first short movie presentation ever at the theatre in 1895, making it the first [[movie theater]] in history. But it was a multi-use variety theatre, not a true kino.  As Erwin Panofsky recalls, in about 1905 "there was only one obscure and faintly disreputable ''kino'' in the whole city of Berlin, bearing, for some unfathomable reason, the English name of 'The Meeting Room'".&lt;ref&gt;Panofsky,E, "Style and Medium in the Motion Pictures", &lt;u&gt;Transition&lt;/u&gt;, 26, (1937)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Boishakhi Mela''' ({{lang-bn|বৈশাখী মেলা}} ''[[Romanization of Bengali|Boishakhi Mêla]]'') is celebrated in '''Dhaka''', Bangladesh, '''London''', England, and in [[Bangladeshi American|New York City]], United States, Tokyo, Japan as well. In London, it takes place across the area of Banglatown in the borough of [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets|Tower Hamlets]] in east London through [[Brick Lane]] to Weavers Fields and Allen Gardens in [[Bethnal Green]]. The event is a celebration of the Bengali New Year, with musical and cultural events held. It is the largest open-air [[South Asia|Asian]] festival in Europe and the largest [[Bengali people|Bengali]] festival outside of [[Bangladesh]]. After the [[Notting Hill Carnival]], it is the second-largest street festival in the UK attracting over 80,000 visitors from around the UK. Although the Bengali new year falls on 14/15 April (1st [[Boishakh]] in the [[Bengali calendar]]), the festival is held in the second weekend of May on a Sunday to avoid the period of higher risk of rain during the month of April. Having started in 1997, the 10th anniversary of the mela was celebrated in 2007.

==History==
The Boishakhi Mela was launched in [[Brick Lane]] and celebrations of the [[Bengali New Year]] have been celebrated by the Bangladeshi community in England since 1997. The original event based in [[Bangladesh]] and [[West Bengal]] is called the [[Pohela Boishakh]]. The festival was created for the purpose of the [[Bangladeshi diaspora]] living in the UK. It was organized by the local people, and is now managed by the Boishakhi Mela Trust Ltd, a non-profit organization.

The Boishakhi Mela is a unique festival, which has been created by a generation of Bangladeshi people who want to celebrate the Bangla New Year. It inspires the [[British Bangladeshi|British Bangladeshi community]] to be more [[Creativity|creative]] during the arrival of the event, through the [[event planning|production]] and the [[presentation]] skills of excellent and innovative ideas through participation in the Boishakhi Mela, including the stage planning, music and dancing. Other than creating the event for the purposes of celebrations for the community, it also aims to gain [[Recognition (sociology)|recognition]] of the Bengali people in the London, by providing different cultures to some British people, and by encouraging them to participate in the event as well as recognising the Bangladeshi presence in London. Also providing the people the skills and opportunities for the young aspirations as well as professional artists to perform their music or dances.

Previously [[Bangla TV]] was the main broadcaster of the Boishakhi Mela event, however since 2005, [[Channel S]] has acquired the rights to broadcast the event due to its commitment to the community (the slogan is ''working for the community''), achieving popular support from the main sponsors within the community.

==Procession==
The event starts first during the morning from 12am at Allen Gardens, through [[Brick Lane]] and ends in Weavers Fields. This is known as the Grand Parade, where there are women and children dressed in colourful [[Bengali people|Bengali]] traditional clothes and masks. There will also be musicians or drummers, including dancers and also the leaders from the community. During the 2008 Mela, a great emperor was leading the parade symbolising the traditional landlord of the [[Indian subcontinent]], along with a tiger, an elephant on wheels, [[rickshaws]], and many others.&lt;ref name=yourlondon&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yourlondon.gov.uk/articles/2007/may/baishakhimela.jsp |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121224030625/http://yourlondon.gov.uk/articles/2007/may/baishakhimela.jsp |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-12-24 |title=Boishakhi Mela |publisher=Your London |date=May 2008 |accessdate=2008-12-10}} &lt;/ref&gt; [[Brick Lane]], which is home to many Bangladeshi-owned Indian restaurants, serves curry along the streets for the visitors, with traditional [[Bengali cuisine]] meals, and cooked by prominent chefs from [[Bangladesh]].&lt;ref name=thelondoner&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.london.gov.uk/londoner/06may/p3a.jsp?nav=off |title=Banglatown spices it up for New Year at the Boishakhi Mela |publisher=The Londoner |date=May 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930205943/http://www.london.gov.uk/londoner/06may/p3a.jsp?nav=off |archive-date=2007-09-30 |accessdate=2008-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Baishakhi mela poster.jpg|thumb|130px|The Tower Hamlets council poster of the Boishakhi Mela]]
After the parade, it will finally progress into the Music Programme, where there will be famous music artists from [[Bangladesh]] and the UK, dancers and actors performing on stages. The four stages will host Bengali music, theatre including [[Sylheti]] drama, and there will also be dance displays throughout the day. The music performed features a wide range of Bengali music, these include [[Traditional music|traditional]] Bengali or [[Folk music|folk]] songs,&lt;ref name=londontown&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.londontown.com/LondonEvents/BaishakhiMela/f89c9 |title=London Events: Boishakhi Mela |publisher=LondonTown.com |accessdate=2008-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Popular music|modern]], [[contemporary music]], and [[rap music]] in Bangla or Sylheti.

==2009: Tower Hamlets council==
Since 2009, the management and planning of the mela was undertaken by the Tower Hamlets Council for the long-term, who called the event "a Boishakhi Mela in Banglatown Brick Lane".&lt;ref&gt;[http://pdf.londontown.com/London/A_London_Calendar_May_2009/PDF/GENERATE May 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091223115032/http://pdf.londontown.com/London/A_London_Calendar_May_2009/PDF/GENERATE |date=23 December 2009 }} Londontown.com. Retrieved on 2009-04-29.&lt;/ref&gt; It was held on 10 May 2009, attracting up to 95,000 people which is a record high of the event. There were more than 250 school children, dancers, musicians and community groups which participated in the event alongside a mechanical [[Bengali tiger]] and the Bangla Queen, which is a four-metre tall peacock structure. The mela also included with nearly 200 stalls serving Bengali spices, food and drinks. It featured many popular artists from Bangladesh and the UK, such as [[Momtaz Begum|Momtaz]], Kajol Dewan and [[Nukul Kumar]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.towerhamlets.gov.uk/lgsl/1200/10003_banglatown_mela.aspx Tower Hamlets Council proudly presents a Boishakhi Mela in Banglatown Brick Lane] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090509185455/http://www.towerhamlets.gov.uk/lgsl/1200/10003_banglatown_mela.aspx |date=9 May 2009 }} Tower Hamlets.

The '''April Fair of Catalonia''', ('''''Feria de abril de Cataluña'''''), is an annual event held in the [[Catalonia|Catalan]] capital of [[Barcelona]], [[Spain]]. It usually takes place over the last week of April and the first week of May. 

In 1971, immigrants to Barcelona from [[Andalusia]], and their descendants, began their own version of the [[Seville Fair]], ''Feria de abril de Sevilla''. Since then the Barcelona event has grown to become the second largest Spring Fair in Spain.

The fair is currently held at the [[2004 Universal Forum of Cultures|Parc del Fòrum]] fairgrounds, a large area on the shores of the [[Mediterranean]], which is covered with rows of ''[[:es:Caseta de feria andaluza|casetas]],'' colorfully decorated [[marquee tent]]s which are temporarily set up. Most of the casetas are sponsored by cultural associations created by and for [[Andalusia]]n immigrants and their descendants. There are also casetas sponsored by the cultural associations of other ethnic groups, such as [[Latin America]]ns and [[Morocco|Moroccans]], as well as others sponsored by political parties. 

A  major difference between the Barcelona and Seville events is that the casetas in Barcelona are completely open to the public. In the casetas, food and drink are served, people either dance on dance floors, or are entertained by musical performances, usually by [[flamenco]] dancers and singers. 

Throughout the fairground, many men, women and children walk around dressed in traditional "trajes de corto" (short jacket, tight trousers and boots) and "trajes de flamenco" ([[flamenco]] style dresses).

The main sponsoring organization is FECAC, the Federation of Andalusian Cultural Groups in Catalonia, or ''Federación de Entidades Culturales Andaluzas en Cataluña''.

Order No. 5,778, ''reprinted in'' Herbert Hoover:  proclamations and executive orders, March 4, 1929 to March 4, 1933, Book 2, pp. [http://quod.lib.umich.edu/p/ppotpus/4731703.PROC.002/294 1066]-[http://quod.lib.umich.edu/p/ppotpus/4731703.PROC.002/295 1067].&lt;/ref&gt;  requiring employers to file weekly compliance reports.&lt;ref name=CRS94408/&gt;&lt;ref name=DOL/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.prevailingwage.org/fdb2mpwa.htm | title=From Davis-Bacon To Michigan’s Prevailing Wage Act | date=January 18, 2008 | accessdate=October 26, 2012 | author=Crawford, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The Copeland Act takes its name from U.S. Senator [[Royal S. Copeland]], its primary sponsor.  Copeland's [[United States Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism|Senate Subcommittee on Crime]] found that up to 25% of the federal money paid for labor under prevailing wage rates was actually returned by the wage-earner as a [[kickback (bribery)|kickback]] to the employing contractor or subcontractor, or to government officials.&lt;ref name=CRS94408&gt;{{cite web | url=http://wlstorage.net/file/crs/94-408.pdf | title=The Davis-Bacon Act: Institutional Evolution and Public Policy | publisher=United States Congressional Research Service | work=CRS report no. 94-408 | date=November 30, 2007 | accessdate=October 26, 2012 | author=Whittaker, William G. | pages=14–15, 41}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Copeland proposed the bill, S. 3041, with a brief statement in the [[United States Senate|Senate]] on April 26, 1934, and it passed without debate in both the Senate and [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]].&lt;ref name=CRS94408/&gt;  It was signed into law by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] on June 13, 1934.&lt;ref name=CRS94408/&gt;

==Text==
The Act is one long sentence as follows:

{{quote|Whoever, by force, intimidation, or threat of procuring dismissal from employment, or by any other manner whatsoever induces any person employed in the construction, prosecution, completion or repair of any public building, public work, or building or work financed in whole or in part by loans or grants from the United States, to give up any part of the compensation to which he is entitled under his contract of employment, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.}}

==Operation==
The Copeland Act is administered by the [[U.S. Department of Labor]].&lt;ref name=DOL/&gt;  The Department of Labor publishes its applicable regulations in the [[Code of Federal Regulations]], Title [[Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations|29]], Part 3.&lt;ref name=DOL/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;29 C.F.R. §§ [http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;sid=99c9a20e960f56be66f17ae91b52c888&amp;rgn=div5&amp;view=text&amp;node=29:1.1.1.1.4&amp;idno=29 3.1—3.11]  ''Contractors And Subcontractors On Public Building Or Public Work Financed In Whole Or In Part By Loans Or Grants From The United States''.  Retrieved October 26, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act originally provided for up to $5000 in fines and up to five years of imprisonment for violations.&lt;ref name=CRS94408/&gt;  The [[Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act]] of 1994 deleted the amount of the fine, bringing it under the general fine provisions of the [[Title 18 of the United States Code|federal criminal statutes]].&lt;ref name=DOLstatute&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/statutes/copeland.htm | title=Wage and Hour Division (WHD): Copeland "Anti-Kickback" Act | publisher=United States Department of Labor | date=July 16, 2012 | accessdate=October 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Deutscher Historikertag''' (or, usually, just ''Historikertag'') is one of the largest conventions of the humanities in Europe. It is organised by the German Association of Historians and the Association for History Teachers. The convention took place for the first time in 1893. The event is organised every second year in a German university town, and gathers c. 3000 historians mostly from the German speaking countries. Speaker at the opening is usually a high-ranking German politician such as the [[President of Germany|President]] or the [[Chancellor of Germany]].

The '''Edmonton International Fringe Festival''' is an annual [[arts festival]] held every August in [[Edmonton]], [[Alberta]], Canada. Produced by the Fringe Theatre Adventures (FTA), it is the oldest and largest [[fringe theatre]] festival in North America (based on ticket sales).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fringetheatre.ca/pdf/media/PSA_FringeopolisVolunteer2011.pdf |title=2011 Volunteer PSA |publisher=Fringe Theatre Adventures |accessdate=May 16, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812031708/http://www.fringetheatre.ca/pdf/media/PSA_FringeopolisVolunteer2011.pdf |archivedate=August 12, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Edmonton Fringe is a founding member of the [[Canadian Association of Fringe Festivals]].

In 2014, 118,280 tickets were sold, up from 117,000 in 2013.

==History==
In 1982, Chinook Theatre's artistic director [[Brian Paisley]] received $50,000 from Edmonton's Summerfest to put together "A Fringe Theatre Event" in Edmonton’s Old Strathcona District. Inspired by the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]], Scotland, the Edmonton Fringe (the first in North America) offered 200 live performances in five theatre venues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fringetheatre.ca/history_timeline.php |title=Fringe Theatre Adventures Historical Timeline |publisher=Fringe Theatre Adventures |accessdate=May 16, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120516233434/http://fringetheatre.ca/history_timeline.php |archivedate=May 16, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Venues==
The festival itself takes place in [[Old Strathcona]] which has a number of permanent theatres (including the Westbury Theatre and Nordic Studio Theatre in the ATB Financial Arts Barns, the [[The Walterdale Playhouse|Walterdale Playhouse]], the [[Varscona Theatre]], the Roxy on Whyte, and the Princess Theatre) and a number of other venues which are converted by FTA or independent artists into temporary theatre venues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fringetheatre.ca/festival/venues/ |title=Venue Locations for the Edmonton Fringe Festival |publisher=Fringe Theatre Adventures |accessdate=August 21, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the festival, the streets and alleys of the neighbourhood are also filled with [[street performers]] and masked or costumed [[actor]]s promoting their plays.

Unlike the [[Edinburgh Festival]]s, where artists are responsible for finding and running their own venues, the Edmonton Fringe implements a system in which for a relatively low application fee, the festival provides artists with a venue, a set number of performances, two technicians, and front-of-house and ticketing services and general festival marketing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://travelclub.canadiangeographic.ca/blogs/feature_articles/archive/2011/04/15/edmonton-fringe-festival.aspx |title=On the Fringe of Edmonton |work=Canadian Geographic Travel |author=Paul Matwychuk |date=April 15, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008165320/http://travelclub.canadiangeographic.ca/blogs/feature_articles/archive/2011/04/15/edmonton-fringe-festival.aspx |archivedate=2011-10-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Artists may also arrange for their own performance space independently as a "Bring Your Own Venue" or BYOV, similar to the Edinburgh Fringe model.

==Performers==

Admittance for performers to the festival is determined by application to a lottery held each November. The emphasis is on [[theatre]], but performances can and do feature almost every form of [[art]] and [[entertainment]]. In addition to the hundreds of national and international artists who travel from around the world to bring their shows to the Edmonton Fringe, there are also hundreds of local performers who participate each year. Many of the local performers have been with the festival since the early years. Performers such as [[Kenneth Brown (playwright)|Ken Brown]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.lfpress.com/2013/06/03/the-multifaceted-thespian-is-involved-in-four-productions-including-two-as-an-actor-at-this-fringe-festival |title=The multifaceted thespian is involved in four productions, including two as an actor, at this Fringe Festival  |last=Belanger |first=Joe |date=June 3, 2013 |website=The London Free Press |accessdate=November 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; local magician Ron Pearson, [[Rapid Fire Theatre]], [[Die-Nasty]], Teatro la Quindicina, [[Panties Productions]], [[Mump and Smoot]], The Wombats, Ribbit Productions, The Dan Show, Nikolai, [[Ryan Stock]] of Insane Entertainment, [[Three Dead Trolls in a Baggie]] and [[Tim Waterson]] have appeared at the festival regularly.

This information is related to the effects of the [[Great Recession]] that happened worldwide from 2007 to 2012.

==Overview==
The Great Recession was the worst post-[[World War II]] contraction on record:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.minneapolisfed.org/publications/special-studies/recession-in-perspective |title=The Recession and Recovery in Perspective |publisher=The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis |accessdate=2012-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Real gross domestic product (GDP) began contracting in the third quarter of 2008, and by early 2009 was falling at an annualized pace not seen since the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/TableView.asp?SelectedTable=1&amp;Freq=Qtr&amp;FirstYear=2007&amp;LastYear=2009 |title=U.S. Department of Commerce. Bureau of Economic Analysis |publisher=Bea.gov his wife  |date=2009-12-22 |accessdate=2010-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Capital investment, which was in decline year-on-year since the final quarter of 2006, matched the 1957–58 post war record in the first quarter of 2009. The pace of collapse in residential investment picked up speed in the first quarter of 2009, dropping 23.2% year-on-year, nearly four percentage points faster than in the previous quarter.
* Domestic demand, in decline for five straight quarters, is still three months shy of the 1974–75 record, but the pace – down 2.6% per quarter vs. 1.9% in the earlier period – is a record-breaker already.

==Trade and industrial production==
[[File:World trade 2000-2010.png|thumb|400 px|right|International trade, 2000-2010. 2000=100.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpb.nl/en/dataoverview/worldtrademonitor Source: ''World trade Monitor''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110126113330/http://www.cpb.nl/en/dataoverview/worldtrademonitor |date=January 26, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A plunge in the volumes of exchanges can be seen as of the second half of 2008.]]In middle-October 2008, the [[Baltic Dry Index]], a measure of shipping volume, fell by 50% in one week, as the credit crunch made it difficult for exporters to obtain [[letter of credit|letters of credit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jones |first=Sam |url=http://ftalphaville.ft.com/blog/2008/10/10/16912/a-juddering-halt-to-world-trade/ |title=A juddering halt to world trade |publisher=Ftalphaville.ft.com |date=2008-10-10 |accessdate=2010-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2009, ''The Economist'' claimed that the financial crisis had produced a "manufacturing crisis", with the strongest declines in industrial production occurring in export-based economies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=13144864 |title=The collapse of manufacturing |publisher=Economist.com |date=2009-02-19 |accessdate=2010-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2009, Britain's ''Daily Telegraph'' reported the following declines in industrial output, from January 2008 to January 2009: Japan −31%, Korea −26%, Russia −16%, Brazil −15%, Italy −14%, Germany −12%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Evans |first=Ambrose |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/comment/ambroseevans_pritchard/4958395/Thanks-to-the-Bank-its-a-crisis-in-the-eurozone-its-a-total-catastrophe.html |title=Thanks to the Bank it's a crisis; in the eurozone it's a total catastrophe |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=2009-03-08 |accessdate=2010-01-21 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some analysts ventured that the world was going through a period of [[deglobalization]] and protectionism after years of increasing economic integration.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/04/AR2009030404221.html A Global Retreat As Economies Dry Up].

The rise of advanced economies in Brazil, India, and China increased the total global labor pool dramatically. Recent improvements in communication and education in these countries has allowed workers in these countries to compete more closely with workers in traditionally strong economies, such as the United States. This huge surge in labor supply has provided downward pressure on wages and contributed to unemployment. So many people's professional career has been down to frozen level at this point of time. There was also change at the management level of the several organisations and due to this there was a huge employee turnover. In brief it can also be described as the collapse of the entire management system of any organisation. It has also been noted that there was an increased in the NPA's of lending by banks.{{fact|date=September 2018}}

==Financial markets==
{{Main|Financial crisis of 2007–2010}}
For a time, major economies of the 21st century were believed to have begun a period of decreased [[volatility (finance)|volatility]], which was sometimes dubbed [[The Great Moderation]], because many economic variables appeared to have achieved relative stability. The return of commodity, stock market, and currency value volatility are regarded as indications that the concepts behind the Great Moderation were guided by false beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/d6527f50-a442-11dd-8104-000077b07658.html |title=Volatility returns with a vengeance |publisher=Ft.com |date=2008-10-27 |accessdate=2010-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

January 2008 was an especially volatile month in world stock markets, with a surge in [[implied volatility]] measurements of the US-based [[S&amp;P 500]] index,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10635708 Markets, Uncertain Times], The Economist, February 4, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  and a sharp decrease in non-U.S. [[stock market]] prices on Monday, January 21, 2008 (continuing to a lesser extent in some markets on January 22). Some headline writers and a general news columnist called January 21 "[[Black Monday]]" and referred to a "global shares crash,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Peter |last=MacMahon |title=Market falls continue as £84bn is lost on Black Monday |url=http://business.scotsman.com/economics/84bn-lost-on-Black-Monday.3695586.jp |work=[[The Scotsman]] |publisher=Johnston Press Digital Publishing |date=2008-01-22 |accessdate=2008-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Dong |last=Zhixin |title=Black Monday for Chinese stocks, down 5% |url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/bizchina/2008-01/21/content_6409697.htm |work=[[China Daily]] |date=2008-01-21 |accessdate=2008-01-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080128031917/http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/bizchina/2008-01/21/content_6409697.htm |archivedate=January 28, 2008 }}

The effects of these events were also felt on the [[Shanghai Composite Index]] in China which lost 5.14 percent, most of this on financial stocks such as [[Ping An Insurance]] and [[China Life]] which lost 10 and 8.76 percent respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Dong |last=Zhixin |url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/bizchina/2008-01/21/content_6409697.htm |title=Black Monday for Chinese stocks, down 5% |publisher=Chinadaily.com.cn |date=2008-01-21 |accessdate=2009-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Investors worried about the effect of a recession in the US economy would have on the Chinese economy. [[Citigroup]] estimates due to the number of exports from China to America a one percent drop in US economic growth would lead to a 1.3 percent drop in China's growth rate.

There were several large Monday declines in stock markets worldwide during 2008, including one in January, one in August, one in September, and another in early October. As of October 2008, stocks in North America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region had all fallen by about 30% since the beginning of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.princeton.edu/~pkrugman/contagion.pdf|title=Contagion, revisited|author=[[Paul Krugman]]|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Dow Jones Industrial Average had fallen about 37% since January 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/q/hp?s=%5EDJI|title=Yahoo Finance Historical Data}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Small-business lending==
New York Times reported that the U.S. Treasury Department found a sizeable decrease in small-business lending by the 22 largest bank recipients of federal bailout money. The banks reduced their small-business lending by US$12.5 billion, a decline of 4.6 percent during a seven-month period ended in November 2009. During that time, the two biggest small-business lenders, Wells Fargo and Bank of America reduced their lending to small-business by 4.4 percent and 6.2 percent, respectively.
Bank of America explained that about half of the decline was attributable to decrease demand, and a decline in sales and creditworthiness among small businesses furthered the drop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=The Places They Go When Banks Say No |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/31/business/smallbusiness/31order.html? |publisher=New York Times |date=2010-01-30 |author=Andrew Martin |accessdate=2010-02-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning February 26, 2009, an Economic Intelligence Briefing was added to the daily intelligence briefings prepared for the President of the United States. This addition reflected the assessment of United States intelligence agencies that the global financial crisis presented a serious threat to international stability.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/25/AR2009022503389.html "CIA Adds Baitch To Threat Updates] White House Given First Daily Briefing" article by Joby Warrick, Washington Post Staff Writer, Thursday, February 26, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2009, British think tank Economist Intelligence Unit published a special report titled 'Manning the barricades' in which it estimated "who's at risk as deepening economic distress foments social unrest". The Report envisioned the next two years filled with great social upheavals, disrupted economies and toppled governments around the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/13490559/EIU-Special-Report-Manning-the-Barricades |title=EIU Special Report – Manning the Barricades |publisher=Scribd.com |date= |accessdate=2010-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Business Week in March 2009 stated that global political instability is rising fast due to the global financial crisis and is creating new challenges that need managing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/mar2009/gb20090310_721176.htm?chan=top+news_top+news+index+-+temp_global+business Business Week] article "Economic Woes Raising Global Political Risk" by Jack Ewing published March 10, 2009 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100207235715/http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/mar2009/gb20090310_721176.htm?chan=top+news_top+news+index+-+temp_global+business |date=February 7, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Associated Press reported in March 2009 that: United States "Director of National Intelligence Dennis Blair has said the economic weakness could lead to political instability in many developing nations."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5ifPGhNhtfxvQZKlCGBR2oW8_GGrgD96RUF6G0 The Associated Press] article "Experts: Financial crisis threatens US security" by STEPHEN MANNING published March 11, 2009 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090320080824/https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5ifPGhNhtfxvQZKlCGBR2oW8_GGrgD96RUF6G0 |date=March 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even some developed countries are seeing political instability.&lt;ref name=BBC1&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7744355.stm |title=BBC |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-11-23 |accessdate=2010-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; NPR reports that David Gordon, a former intelligence officer who now leads research at the Eurasia Group, said: "Many, if not most, of the big countries out there have room to accommodate economic downturns without having large-scale political instability if we're in a recession of normal length. If you're in a much longer-run downturn, then all bets are off."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=100781975 NPR] article "Economic Crisis Poses Threat To Global Stability" by Tom Gjelten&lt;/ref&gt;

:"The recent wave of popular unrest was not confined to Eastern Europe. Ireland, Iceland, France, the U.K. and Greece also experienced street protests, but many Eastern European governments seem more vulnerable as they have limited policy options to address the crisis and little or no room for fiscal stimulus due to budgetary or financing constrains. Deeply unpopular austerity measures, including slashed public wages, tax hikes and curbs on social spending will keep fanning public discontent in the Baltic states, Hungary and Romania. Dissatisfaction linked to the economic woes will be amplified in the countries where governments have been weakened by high-profile corruption and fraud scandals (Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Romania, the UK and Bulgaria)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/02/25/eastern-europe-eu-banks-euro-opinions-columnists_nouriel_roubini.html |title=Forbes |publisher=Forbes |date=2009-02-25 |accessdate=2010-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political scientists have argued that the economic stasis triggered social churning that got expressed through protests on a variety of issues across the developing world. In Brazil, disaffected youth protested over a bus-fare hike;&lt;ref name="nytReport"&gt;Romero, Simon. [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/14/world/americas/bus-fare-protests-hit-brazils-two-biggest-cities.html?_r=0 "Bus-fare protests hit Brazil's two biggest cities"],  [[The New York Times]], June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; in India, they marched in millions protesting against lack of safety for women; in Turkey, they protested the conversion of a park to a mall&lt;ref name="guardianReport"&gt;Letsch, Constanze. [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/31/istanbul-protesters-violent-clashes-police "Turkey protests spread after violence in Istanbul over park demolition"],  [[The Guardian]], May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and in Israel, they protested against high rents in Tel Aviv. In all these cases, the ostensible immediate cause of the protest was amplified by the underlying social suffering induced by the great recession.

==Gendered effects==

American popular media labeled the Great Recession the "mancession" because of the many male dominated industries affected (e.g., construction) although many more men were hired than women during the recovery period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Luhby|first1=Tammy|title=Where have all the women's jobs gone?|url=http://money.cnn.com/2012/04/19/news/economy/women_jobs/|website=CNN.com|publisher=CNN|accessdate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 2009 the unemployment rate for men was 10.7%, while women's unemployment peaked at 8.4%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11150-013-9181-1 |title=Gender, added-worker effects, and the 2007–2009 recession: Looking within the household |journal=Review of Economics of the Household |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=209–235 |year=2013 |last1=Starr |first1=Martha A }}&lt;/ref&gt; This trend of the "mancession" was seen in other countries as well; in 2008 605,000 of the 891,000 who lost their jobs in the United Kingdom were men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/13545701.2013.808762 |title=Economic Recession and Recovery in the UK: What's Gender Got to do with It? |journal=Feminist Economics |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=108–123 |year=2013 |last1=McKay |first1=Ailsa |last2=Campbell |first2=Jim |last3=Thomson |first3=Emily |last4=Ross |first4=Susanne }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stress of unemployment affects men and women differently. Some studies have concluded that men and blue-collar workers experience the most mental distress when they are [[involuntary unemployment|involuntarily unemployed]]&lt;ref name=PaulMoser2009&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jvb.2009.01.001 |title=Unemployment impairs mental health: Meta-analyses |journal=Journal of Vocational Behavior |volume=74 |issue=3 |pages=264–282 |year=2009 |last1=Paul |first1=Karsten I |last2=Moser |first2=Klaus }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been attributed to the greater structural vulnerability of blue collar workers in US economy as well as constructions of masculinity.&lt;ref name=PaulMoser2009/&gt; Men may feel pressure to fulfill their socially constructed role as "breadwinners" and may feel ashamed if they are not able to contribute financially to the household.&lt;ref name="Fukuda-Parr et al 2013"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/13545701.2013.806990 |title=Critical Perspectives on Financial and Economic Crises: Heterodox Macroeconomics Meets Feminist Economics |journal=Feminist Economics |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=4–31 |year=2013 |last1=Fukuda-Parr |first1=Sakiko |last2=Heintz |first2=James |last3=Seguino |first3=Stephanie }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2139/ssrn.1402687 |title=The Current Economic and Financial Crisis: A Gender Perspective |journal=SSRN Electronic Journal |year=2009 |last1=Antonopoulos |first1=Rania |hdl=10419/31580 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of mental health data in America from directly after the 2008 financial crisis that led to the Great Recession, however, found that women experienced more stress than men because they were more likely to be the financial managers of the household and therefore felt the impact of the recession on household budgets more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Heretick |first1=Donna M. L. |title=Clinicians' reports on the impact of the 2008 financial crisis on mental health clients |journal=Journal of Social, Behavioral, and Health Sciences |volume=7 |issue=1 |url=https://scholarworks.waldenu.edu/jsbhs/vol7/iss1/1/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Greece women also reported poor mental health, more so than men, upon losing their jobs.&lt;ref name=Drydakis2015&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2014.12.025 |pmid=25589031 |title=The effect of unemployment on self-reported health and mental health in Greece from 2008 to 2013: A longitudinal study before and during the financial crisis |journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine |volume=128 |pages=43–51 |year=2015 |last1=Drydakis |first1=Nick |hdl=10419/107534 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been attributed to higher rates of long term unemployment, poor housing and nutrition, debt, and discrimination, which all generally affect women more.&lt;ref name=Drydakis2015/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=European Commission|title=Urban Cities Facing the Crisis. Impact and Responses|journal=European Commission|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=World Health Organization |title=Impact of Economic Crisis on Mental Health |date=2011 |url=http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/134999/e94837.pdf }}{{pn|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The literature indicates that women may experience distress and decreased mental well being because of existing inequalities, while men's mental health is affected by the pressures of masculinity.&lt;ref name="Fukuda-Parr et al 2013"/&gt;

'''Eyrecourt''', historically known as '''Donanaghta''' ({{Irish place name|Dún an Uchta}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.logainm.ie/en/1390438 |publisher=Irish Placenames Database |title = Dún an Uchta - Eyrecourt|accessdate= 1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a village in [[County Galway]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. Eyrecourt is on the [[R356 road (Ireland)|R356]] [[Regional road (Ireland)|regional road]] 12&amp;nbsp;km west of the [[Banagher bridge]] over the [[River Shannon]].

==History==
The [[John Eyre (settler)|Eyres]] after whom the village is named, as well as other places such as [[Eyre Square]] in [[Galway City]], were an English family who came over with Cromwell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= http://www.celticcousins.net/ireland/1824eyrecourt.htm |work= Pigot's Directory of Ireland |date= 1824 |publisher=Pigot &amp; Company |title= Eyrecourt |page=204 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their former residence, [[Eyrecourt Castle]] (now a ruin),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.landedestates.ie/LandedEstates/jsp/property-show.jsp?id=872 |publisher=Landedestates.ie |title= Eyrecourt Castle|accessdate= 1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides the large metal gateway at the eastern end of main street and the {{convert|100|acre|km2|adj=on}} castle lawn beyond. The family were for many years closely associated with the local hunt, the Galway Blazers.

==Amenities==
The village stands midway along the [[Beara-Breifne Way]]; a historic way-marked way for walking, cycling and heritage. Eyrecourt is served by two public houses, a post office, library, shop, garage and fast food outlet, pharmacy, tractor dealership, medical centre, primary school, several small enterprises and the [[Meelick-Eyrecourt|Meelick-Eyrecourt GAA club]]. Various groups and classes use the village hall, including for Pilates, martial arts, scouting, art classes, badminton and other sports. Local sporting clubs include a kayaking club.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://meelickeyrecourtkayakclub.com|title=Meelick-Eyrecourt Kayak Club - Covering the Mid-Shannon|website=meelickeyrecourtkayakclub.com|language=en-US|access-date=17 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every second year in June the village hosts a festival of early machinery, the "Eyrecourt Vintage Festival", when old tractors, steam-engines and early farm machines are displayed. Each September Eyrecourt also hosts an [[agricultural show]], which includes livestock shows and baking and gardening competitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.eyrecourtagrishow.ie |publisher=Eyrecourt Agricultural Show committee|title=Eyrecourt Agricultural Show website |accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eyrecourt is approximately 70&amp;nbsp;km (1 hour by car) from Galway and 150&amp;nbsp;km (2 hours by car) from Dublin.

The '''Flagstaff Hill incident''' was an international incident between the [[Republic of Ireland]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. It took place on the night of 5/6 May 1976 near Cornamucklagh, a [[townland]] just inside the [[Cooley Peninsula]] in the north of [[County Louth]] in the [[Republic of Ireland]], when the [[Irish Army]] and [[Garda Síochána]] arrested eight British [[Special Air Service]] soldiers who had illegally crossed the [[Irish border]].

==Background==
{{See also|Drummuckavall Ambush|Kingsmill massacre}}
The worsening security situation in south [[County Armagh]], especially after the [[Drummuckavall Ambush|killing of three British soldiers at an observation post]] in November 1975 and the [[Kingsmill massacre|massacre of ten Protestant workers]] in January 1976, prompted British PM [[Harold Wilson]] to publicly acknowledge the presence of D squadron of the [[Special Air Service]] (SAS), which was deployed to [[Bessbrook]] Mill.&lt;ref&gt;Harnden, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; The ambush of the observation post exposed the fact that conventional military tactics hadn't worked for the British Government in South Armagh, since the British Army report of this incident identified a number of basic mistakes regarding camouflage, routine patterns and the observation post's arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;Harnden, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 October 1971, a confrontation took place between British and Irish troops at a cross-border bridge between the Republic and Northern Ireland, at the village of Munnelly, between counties [[County Fermanagh|Fermanagh]] and [[County Monaghan|Monaghan]]. A British patrol was laying explosive charges to destroy the bridge, as part of an effort to destroy bridges and roads being used by the [[Provisional IRA]] to import arms and supplies from the Republic of Ireland into Northern Ireland. A [[Garda Síochána]] officer stated that the bridge was at least half in the Republic, and the British Army officer on the scene disputed this. The [[Irish Army]] then deployed a unit of soldiers armed with [[H&amp;K MP5]] submachine guns, and its commander demanded that the British Army surrender their explosives. Following a 90-minute standoff, the British Army withdrew.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1144&amp;dat=19711028&amp;id=DIkbAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=MlEEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2761,5199277 Irish, British in confrontation] [[United Press International]], 28 October 1971&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xfFOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=2wEEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7126,4901821 British, Irish in Border Confrontation], [[Associated Press]], 28 October 1971&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Talón, Vicente (1972). ''Guerra en Irlanda''. Ed. San Martín, p. 37. [[OCLC]]: 40663502 {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first high-profile action carried out by the SAS in 1976 was in March when it abducted [[Sean McKenna (IRA volunteer)|Sean McKenna]], an IRA member wanted for attempted murder and a string of other offences. McKenna was abducted at 2:30 am while sleeping at home in [[Edentober]], on the Republic's side of the border, in a cross-border raid by the SAS. Once across the border, he was officially arrested by another detachment of the British Army.

In April, the SAS killed IRA member [[Peter Cleary]] in controversial circumstances near [[Forkhill]], just 60 yards inside Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Harnden, pp. 161–163&lt;/ref&gt; Although the porous nature of the border had led to 189 inadvertent border crossings by the British security forces in the previous two years, these latest incursions heightened the sensitivity to the issue by the Garda Síochána.&lt;ref name="inc"&gt;Harnden, p. 164&lt;/ref&gt; Another concern for the Irish Government was the activity of [[Ulster loyalism|loyalist]] paramilitary elements in the area, one of which had kidnapped and killed a civilian named [[Seamus Ludlow]] near [[Dundalk]] four days earlier.&lt;ref name="argus"&gt;[http://www.seamusludlow.com/argus030506.htm "Night Gardai and Army arrested eight armed SAS men in Omeath"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070816143540/http://www.seamusludlow.com/argus030506.htm |date=16 August 2007 }} by Kevin Mulligan. The Argus, Dundalk, 3 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==The incident==
After the kidnapping and murder of [[Seamus Ludlow]] near [[Dundalk]], the Republic's security forces stepped up their presence along the border.&lt;ref name=argus/&gt; A checkpoint was set up by the Gardaí and the Irish Army on Flagstaff Road&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Murray| first = Raymond| title = The SAS in Ireland| year = 1990| isbn = 0-85342-938-3| page = 176 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[townland]] of Cornamucklagh, some 700 yards inside [[County Louth]] in the Republic.&lt;ref name="Hara"&gt;Harnden, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;
At 10:40 pm, the Gardaí stopped a [[Triumph 2000]] car coming from the north with two men inside.&lt;ref name=Hara/&gt; The driver obeyed the signal to stop, but when questioned by the policemen about their destination, they avoided a straight answer. They were asked to step out of the vehicle, after one Garda noticed that the passenger had what seemed to be a gun hidden under a map. The unidentified men were unwilling to leave the car until Irish Army soldiers came out of the bushes and pointed [[Heckler &amp; Koch HK33]] rifles at them in support of the Gardaí.&lt;ref name=argus/&gt; The two men, who wore plain clothes, were [[Fiji|Fijian]]-born trooper Ilisoni Ligari and trooper John Lawson, both soldiers in the SAS. After searching the car, the policemen found a Sterling submachine-gun and a Browning pistol.&lt;ref name=Hara/&gt; The Gardaí immediately arrested them, with the help of the Army, and took them to nearby [[Omeath]] Garda station.&lt;ref name=argus/&gt; Lawson&lt;ref name=Hara/&gt; initially claimed that they were off-duty soldiers who became stranded while test-driving the car,&lt;ref name="rev"&gt;[http://www.nuzhound.com/articles/irish_news/arts2006/jul13_sanctions_threatened_1976_arrests.php Revealed — how British threatened harsh sanctions over SAS arrests] by Barry McCaffrey. [[Irish News]], 13 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and Ligari refused to talk about "the mission we were on".&lt;ref name=Hara/&gt; It later transpired that Lawson and Ligari were in the area to collect or relieve Staff Sergeant Malcolm Rees and Corporal Ronald Nicholson; two SAS soldiers who were carrying out surveillance from a hidden observation post on Flagstaff Hill, which is just inside South Armagh in [[Northern Ireland]] overlooking [[Carlingford Lough]].&lt;ref name=Hara/&gt; According to author [[Peter Taylor (journalist)|Peter Taylor]], Rees and Nicholson were actually deployed on the Republic's side of the border.&lt;ref name="tay"&gt;Taylor, pp. 192–193&lt;/ref&gt;

When the soldiers manning the surveillance post failed to meet Ligari and Lawson, they radioed their base at Bessbrook Mill. Initially an IRA ambush was suspected. Four plain-clothes SAS soldiers—troopers Nial McClean, Vincent Thompson, Nigel Burchell and Carsten Rhodes—were sent to search for their missing comrades in two cars, picking up the two men from the observation post in the process.&lt;ref name=Hara/&gt; The team was carrying another three Sterling sub machine-guns, &lt;span&gt;a &lt;/span&gt;[[Remington Model 870|Remington pump-action shotgun]] and 222 rounds of ammunition.&lt;ref name=tay/&gt; The first vehicle — a [[Hillman Avenger]] carrying Thompson, McClean, Rees and Nicholson - drove up to the Garda checkpoint at 2:05 am. Rees and Nicholson were still wearing [[British Army]] uniforms. The second car—a [[Vauxhall Victor]] with Burchell and Rhodes—was stopped shortly after. Sergeant Rees tried to explain the situation to the Gardaí: "Let us go back. If the roles were reversed we would let you go back. We are all doing the one bloody job", but he eventually ordered his men to surrender their weapons after Irish Army soldiers surrounded both cars and aimed rifles at them.&lt;ref name=Hara/&gt; The Garda unit, commanded by Sergeant Pat McLoughlin, radioed his superiors for instructions on how to deal with the men now in custody. The shotgun drew the attention of the Gardaí since the same type of weapon was used in three recent murders in the area. The [[Omeath]] Garda station was ordered to keep the men in custody until a decision was taken at a Governmental level in Dublin. Before dawn, it was decided that the SAS team be transferred to [[Dundalk]] Garda station.&lt;ref name=argus/&gt;

==Diplomatic consequences==
The arrest and detention of eight British Army soldiers put Irish [[Taoiseach]] [[Liam Cosgrave]] and his coalition government in a dilemma; if he released them without charge he was giving a green light for further British military incursions into the Republic, but if he permitted them to be put on trial and they were convicted, diplomatic relations with Britain would be at risk.&lt;ref name=argus/&gt; A report published by Mr Justice Henry Barron in 2006 revealed that the soldiers were questioned whilst in Garda custody about the three murders, especially that of [[Seamus Ludlow]] that had been recently committed in the area. They were also questioned about the 1974 [[Dublin and Monaghan bombings]],&lt;ref name=rev/&gt; and their weapons were checked in relation to forensic evidence from the murders in question.&lt;ref&gt;O'Halpin, Eunan (2000). ''Defending Ireland: the Irish state and its enemies since 1922''. Oxford University Press, p. 336&lt;/ref&gt; Both protesters and media camped outside Dundalk station. There were concerns that the station could be attacked by a mob or the IRA at any moment seeking to get at the prisoners. The detainees were subsequently moved under heavy armed escort to [[Dublin]], where they were charged by the [[Special Criminal Court]] with possession of firearms with intent to endanger life, and for carrying firearms without a certificate.&lt;ref name=argus/&gt;  The charges carried a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.&lt;ref name=rev/&gt; The 8 soldiers were released on bail after the British embassy paid £40,000 and a helicopter flew them out of the state. The British Army Minister, Bob Brown, apologised to the Irish Government, saying the incursion over the border had been a mistake.&lt;ref name=argus/&gt; The British Government, embarrassed by the situation,&lt;ref name=tay/&gt; gave top priority to the immediate release of the soldiers. [[Sir Arthur Galsworthy]], then British ambassador to the Republic of Ireland, stressed his concern about the finding of a shotgun and a dagger among the weapons confiscated by the Gardaí, and the fact that most of the soldiers were in plain clothes, and that the two groups had given different accounts of their purposes of presence within the Republic of Ireland. When it became clear that a trial was unavoidable, the British Government hardened its position, with a member of the [[Foreign Office]] proposing economic sanctions against the Republic, and even mooting the creation of a "buffer zone" along the border, which would have created "a no-man's land in which the terrorist could do what they would". A confidential memo from the [[Northern Ireland Office]] also called for pressure on the Irish Government to discharge the soldiers on the grounds that the safety of the SAS men in an Irish prison could not be guaranteed.&lt;ref name=rev/&gt;

==Aftermath==
Although Director of Public Prosecutions [[Eamonn Barnes]] was pressured by the Irish Government to drop the charges,&lt;ref&gt;http://politico.ie/archive/how-they-got-rid-commissioner-ed-garvey&lt;/ref&gt; the eight SAS men stood trial in March 1977. They were each found guilty and fined £100 for possession of arms and ammunition without firearms licensing.&lt;ref name="map"&gt;Harnden, p. 166&lt;/ref&gt; The weapons were returned to the British Government after forensic analysis by the Garda established that they had not used in any crime under investigation by it in the Republic of Ireland.&lt;ref name=tay/&gt; A British military source later explained that the use of a 1:63,000 scale map instead of a 1:20,000 map had led the SAS men to be south of the border without knowing it.&lt;ref name=map/&gt; In 1976, there were another 54 incursions by British forces inside the Republic's boundaries.&lt;ref name=inc/&gt; On 28 October 1986 there was another cross-border incident in which a British soldier was arrested by the Gardaí after an IRA mortar attack on Drummuckavall British Army watchtower in [[County Armagh]]. A red [[Ford Escort (Europe)|Ford Escort]] was pursued while escaping across the border towards [[Thomas Murphy (Irish republican)|Thomas Murphy]]'s farm by soldiers of the [[Scots Guards]]. One of the soldiers, a Lance Corporal, broke into a shed, where he was confronted by two IRA members. The soldier had inadvertently crossed the border and after a brief brawl with the two men, a Garda patrol arrived at the scene and arrested the soldier. He was taken to the Gardaí station at Dundalk, but was released six hours later after liaison between senior [[Royal Ulster Constabulary|RUC]] and Garda officers.&lt;ref&gt;Harnden, pp. 257–258&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Fort Bridger Rendezvous''' is an annual reenactment of trading which took place during the [[North American fur trade|Fur Trade Era]] between [[mountain men]], Native Americans, [[fur trappers]] and traders. The event takes place at [[Fort Bridger]], [[Wyoming]]. The Fort Bridger Rendezvous is a mountain man rendezvous in celebration of the Fur Trade Rendezvous Era that occurred in the Rocky Mountains between 1825-1840. It is one of the largest mountain man gatherings in the nation.
Held annually the first weekend of September at Fort Bridger Wyoming, this Mountain Man Rendezvous is an experience your family will be sure to remember for years. 

==History==
The [[fur trade]] era was from 1825-1840. It was caused by the popularity of [[beaver]] skin hats on the east coast of the United States and Europe. In response to the high demand fur trappers and traders headed west to hunt for beaver. In the fall and winter the beavers would be hunted and their pelts would be scraped, stretched and salted for shipment. Then in the spring and summer these trappers would travel over 1,000 miles one way to [[St. Louis]] so they could sell their product for supplies. The suppliers decided it would be more effective coming to the mountain men and trading supplies for the furs there instead of St. Louis, thus the Rendezvous was born. The first Rendezvous took place in southern Wyoming in 1825.  

Every year over [[Labor Day]] weekend the town of [[Fort Bridger, Wyoming]] holds a reenactment of the Rendezvous which took place during the Fur Trade Era. Marksmanship contests are held with rifles of the time period, along with axe throwing contests and archery. Foods of the time period are also sold, and the Fort Bridger Historical site has workshops people can get involved in to learn about what life was like in those days.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Zabelka.jpg|thumb|George Zabelka]] --&gt;

'''George B. Zabelka''', a Catholic chaplain with the U.S. Army Air Force, was stationed on Tinian Island in the South Pacific in 1945, where he was assigned to [[509th Composite Group]]. This is the unit of the crews of ''[[Enola Gay]]'' and ''[[Bockscar]]'' (aka Bock’s Car and Bocks Car), that dropped the Atomic Bombs (”Little Boy” and “Fat Man”) on [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]]. His duties included saying Mass on Sunday and during the week, hearing confessions, talking with the soldiers, and other typical duties of a wartime chaplain.

Zabelka was also very much a soldier and once received a military reprimand for “excessive zeal.” He left the military with the rank of lieutenant colonel. Then in 1973 he went on a retreat with other priests of his diocese that focused on the issue and the implications of Gospel nonviolence. About December 1975, he did what he called “an about face” (using a military term that means turn completely around).

But his conversion may have started just months after the dropping of the atomic bombs as he says: ''"Three of us chaplains took a trip to Nagasaki to see [the results of] the bombing. There were no restrictions of any kind. So we went to the nearest place where there were still the survivors. And this I think is what really got me started on even a beginning of a new way of thinking on this. Because, here were little children that were horribly burned and suffering and dying. By that time there were nurses and doctors taking care of them, because this was two or three months afterwards. But this was the beginning of a whole new kind of worm squirming in my stomach that something was wrong. These little children had nothing to do with the war. Why were they suffering?''" This quote can be found between 25:40 and 26:17 of [https://vimeo.com/48820359 The Reluctant Prophet DVD].

==Early life==

George Benedict Zabelka (1915-1992), the Catholic Chaplain for the [[509th Composite Group]], the Atomic Bomb crews on Tinian Island in 1945, was born in St. John’s, Michigan on May 8, 1915. His parents, John J. (1883-1957) and Katarina (Zolek, 1874-1940) Zabelka, were [[Moravia]]n Catholics who immigrated to the United States before the First World War, from [[Austria-Hungary]] where his father served in the army. George Zabelka was raised on a sixty-acre farm and attended elementary school in a one-room schoolhouse in St. John’s, Michigan. Upon graduation from grammar school, he entered the Sacred Heart Minor Seminary of the Catholic Archdiocese of Detroit. He completed his high school education there, and matriculated to Mount St. Mary’s Catholic Seminary in Cincinnati, Ohio, where he completed his college degree and theological education. He was ordained a Roman Catholic priest on June 7, 1941 by the Catholic Bishop of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Lansing|Diocese of Lansing]], Michigan, Joseph H. Albers. He celebrated his first Mass at St. Joseph’s Church in St. John’s Michigan. His first pastoral assignment was as assistant pastor to Rev. John Blasko at Sacred Heart Parish in Flint, Michigan. He remained in that position until December 1943.

==Military Life==

In December 1943, Rev. Zabelka joined the United States Army Air Corps Chaplaincy, attending Chaplaincy School at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He served first as a chaplain at Wright Field, a United States Army Air Corps airfield in Riverside, Ohio. His persistent request for combat chaplaincy service eventually resulted in his being assigned to the 309th General Hospital Unit on Tinian Island in the Marianas in 1945. The 509th Composite Group, which included the atomic bomb crews, also arrived in 1945 on Tinian Island in preparation for the bombing of Japan. The 509th had a Protestant chaplain but no Catholic chaplain. For security reasons, the 509th Group was sealed off from all other military personnel and operations on the island. Rev. George Zabelka was formally assigned by his military superiors to serve as its Catholic chaplain through August 1945.

In September 1945 he was transferred to mainland Japan. He served in the Occupation Forces in Japan from September 1945 to November 1946. He was first stationed on the southern island of Honshu, then in Tokyo and finally at Yamagata. During this time he earned his paratrooper’s wings. Zabelka was not only a Catholic military chaplain, but was known to be “all soldier.” He once received a military reprimand for “excessive zeal.”

George Zabelka was discharged from the military at Fort Lewis, Washington, in December 1946 with the rank of major. He returned to the Diocese of Lansing and was assigned as a parish priest to St. Thomas Aquinas Parish in East Lansing, where he was the moderator of the Newman Center at Michigan State University and was the Catholic chaplain for the Boys Vocational School in Lansing. He joined the Michigan National Guard and was assigned as Catholic Chaplain to the 125th Infantry Regiment. He stayed in the National Guard for twenty years, retiring as a lieutenant colonel.

==Back to Parish Life==

In 1955 Fr. Zabelka was transferred to Sacred Heart Parish in Flint, Michigan, with notification from the Bishop that the parish would soon close. He fought successfully to keep the church and parochial school open for black children, despite major objections from a variety of sources and an ongoing struggle over finances.

He and his parishioners started “Heart of the City” in Flint. This was a project whose goal was to train young black people for employment and to offer them counseling and other social services, including sometimes food, if there was a need. He preached against racism, vigorously and often during a time when racial antagonism and enmity often erupted into violence. He participated in the Poor Peoples’ March on Washington and stayed in Resurrection City.

In 1968, with riots erupting all over the U.S., including in Detroit, in response to the murder of the [[Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr.]], George Zabelka was the only white person able to walk the streets of Flint, in the company of young black men and women who were trying to prevent Flint from turning into Detroit. During these years, Zabelka also founded “Focus on Progress, a program to help students having academic difficulty in school upgrade their learning skills in those areas in which they were deficient. In the African-American community of Flint it was universally said, “Fr. George is a real civil rights man.”

In 1969, he suffered a heart attack. In 1971, following his recovery, he was transferred to a smaller parish, St. James, in Mason, Michigan. During this decade, motivated by his lifelong devotion to the Blessed Mother and the Rosary, he became a Tertiary Dominican, an order uniquely related to the Rosary and its history. He took the name Brother Thomas.

==His Conversion to Gospel Nonviolence==

In 1973, Rev. Zabelka attended a three-day workshop given by his Diocese for the priests of his Diocese on Gospel Nonviolence directed by a layman, [[Emmanuel Charles McCarthy]]. In the following two years, he attended the same workshop on two other occasions in different locations. Then, in his 1975 Christmas letter to his friends, he wrote this: ”“I do not want to lose any of you as my friends and I certainly do not want to offend any of you, but I must do an about face. I have attended this workshop on Christian Nonviolence several times and have read the books that were recommended at it. I have come to the conclusion that the truth of the Gospel is that Jesus was nonviolent and taught nonviolence as His way.””

In February 1976, he retired from the life of an active parish priest in the Diocese of Lansing and dedicated the remainder of his life to teaching the centrality of the nonviolent Jesus Christ of the Gospels and His Way of nonviolent love of friends and enemies for peace of soul, for peace among people and for the eternal salvation of all. He began and continued to ceaselessly insist that all the Churches of Christianity, by which he meant all Christians within all Christian churches, regardless of the rank each held in his or her Church, must begin to or return to following the Nonviolent Jesus of the Gospels and His Way of Nonviolent Love of all under all circumstances: ”"Until the various churches within Christianity repent and began to proclaim by word and deed what Jesus preached with relation to violence and enemies; there is not hope for anything other than escalating violence and destruction.””

==I was brainwashed. They told me it was necessary==

In August 1980 ”Sojourners” magazine published an extensive interview with Rev. George Zabelka, titled “I was brainwashed. They told me it was necessary.” In the interview, he described the process of his conversion from a hard-core belief in the moral validity of Christian Just War Theory as a viable moral option for a disciple of Jesus to a full-fledged and public commitment to the nonviolent Jesus of the Gospels and his way of nonviolent love of friends and enemies. The interview was picked up and published in religious and non-religious journals and books throughout the world. Its considerable influence was immediate, and it extends to this day.

One example of this is found in ”The Bishops and the Bomb”, James Castelli’s history of the U.S. Catholic Bishops’ Conference’s famous war-peace pastoral, The Challenge of Peace. Castelli writing about Bishop Frank Murphy, the sole initiator of the document that became The Challenge of Peace, and what influenced him to make this proposal to the U.S. Bishops says,”But the major influence on Murphy may have been Father George Zabelka, a Catholic priest, who as an Air Force chaplain had blessed the men who dropped the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, just as he had previously blessed the men who were inflicting massive bombing damage on the civilians of Tokyo. Murphy quoted from an interview with Zabelka in the evangelical Christian magazine, SOJOURNERS” (August, 1980).

”Fr. Zabelka: “I was brainwashed! It never entered my mind to publicly protest the consequences of these massive air raids. I was told the raids were necessary; told openly by the military and told implicitly by my Church’s leadership. To the best of my knowledge no American cardinals or bishops were opposing these mass air raids. Silence in such matters, especially by a public body like the American bishops, is a stamp of approval.””

==A Pilgrimage of Forgiveness==

Also as a consequence of that article, Zabelka and a Jesuit priest, [[Jack Morris (Jesuit)|Jack Morris]], planned, organized, and participated in the Bethlehem Peace Pilgrimage. This was a 7,500-mile (4,000 in the U.S, 3,500 in Europe) two-year walk on behalf of bringing God’s peace to humanity. It began in 1983, when walkers left the nuclear submarine base in Bangor, Washington, and it ended on Christmas Eve in 1984 in Bethlehem, Palestine/Israel. Zabelka was 67 when he began this pilgrimage.
In 1985, Fr. George Zabelka made a pilgrimage from Hiroshima to Nagasaki on the fortieth anniversary of the atomic bombings of those Japanese cities, as a way of asking those harmed by the bombings for forgiveness for himself and for his Church, ”“for bringing you death instead of the fullness of life, misery instead of mercy.””

As a tribute to Zabelka’s courage in admitting that he had made a grave moral mistake by his silence during the fire-bombings of Japan’s cities and the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and of Nagasaki, the renowned Australian folk singer, [http://www.peterkearneysongs.com.au/soh_discog.htm Peter Kearney], wrote and recorded a ballad, “[http://www.emmanuelcharlesmccarthy.org/hiroshima-hymn-my-name-is-george-zabelka-by-peter-kearney/ My Name is George Zabelka]” heard by tens of millions across the world, although never played on the secular or religious radio stations and networks in the United States. In 1988, a full-length documentary telling the story of Zabelka’s life and conversion was released in Great Britain. ”[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oITZo3ejz8 ”’The Reluctant Prophet”’]” has been viewed worldwide and is used, to this day, in the religious education classes of many local churches as well as in local peace and justice programs. To this day, however, it has not ever been shown on U.S. public or private secular television, nor on U.S. Christian television networks.
In his homily at a 1991 Mass celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of his ordination to the Catholic priesthood, Fr. Zabelka said, ”“I looked in the Catholic Bible. I looked in the Protestant Bible. I looked in the Orthodox Bible. And, in every one of them, there it was in no uncertain terms. Jesus saying ‘Love your enemies.’””

==Death==

George B. Zabelka’s died in Flint, Michigan on April 11, 1992. He was buried on April 15, 1992, from Sacred Heart Church in Flint, in a funeral liturgy and Mass of the Resurrection. The Bishop of the diocese, Kenneth Povich, presided at the Mass, which was concelebrated by other bishops and many priests, with a congregation that greatly overflowed the capacity of the church. In his homily, Bishop Povish commented: ”“In our priestly gatherings, when we would concelebrate Mass together, at the prayers of petition Fr. George would always have us pray for our enemies.””

As he requested, Zabelka’s body is buried in the veterans’ section, Wing Victory II, at Crestwood Memorial Cemetery in Grand Blanc, Michigan.

The '''Grenzau Feud''' ({{lang-de|Grenzauer Fehde}}) was a warlike conflict between the troops of [[Koblenz]] in the [[Electorate of Trier]] on the one hand and Lord Philip of [[House of Isenburg|Isenburg]] and Lord Reynard of [[Barony of Westerburg|Westerburg]] on the other at [[Grenzau Castle|Grenzau]] on 20 April 1347. The Koblenz soldiers were ambushed and 172 were killed.&lt;ref&gt;Tilemann Elhen von Wolfhagen: ''The Limburg Chronicle'' (=''[[Monumenta Germaniae Historica]]. Scriptores qui vernacula lingua usi sunt." T.4, P.1 = "''Deutsche Chroniken und andere Geschichtsbücher des Mittelalters.''" Vol. 4, Pt. 1). Published by Arthur Wyss. Hahn, Hanover, 1883,[http://daten.digitale-sammlungen.de/0000/bsb00000777/images/?id=00000777&amp;page=31 p.&amp;nbsp;31].&lt;/ref&gt;

Processions and memorial services to commemorate the fallen citizens were held in the churches of Koblenz on the Friday after Easter annually until about 1800. After mass in the [[Church of Our Lady, Koblenz|Church of Our Lady]], a citizen of Koblenz used to climb a stone block on a house opposite (then the parsonage) and told the story of the feud..&lt;ref&gt;[[Johann Christian von Stramberg|Christian von Stramberg]]: ''Coblenz, die Stadt. Historisch und topographisch dargestellt'' (= ''Denkwürdiger und nützlicher Rheinischer Antiquarius, welcher die wichtigsten und angenehmsten geographischen, historischen und politischen Merkwürdigkeiten des ganzen Rheinstroms, von seinem Ausfluß in das Meer bis zu seinem Ursprunge darstellt. Mittelrhein.'' Sect. 1, Vol. 4). Vol. 4. Hergt, Koblenz, 1856, [http://reader.digitale-sammlungen.de/de/fs1/object/goToPage/bsb11041175.html?pageNo=353 p.&amp;nbsp;327].&lt;/ref&gt;

The Grenzau Feud is classified as one of the warlike conflicts surrounding the election of [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]]. From 1314, [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Louis IV]] was the [[Roman-German king]]. After 1340, however, the German electors increasingly distanced themselves from Louis and in 1346 elected Charles IV as [[counter-king]]. The election of Charles IV marked the beginning of a civil war between king and counter-king. On the side of Charles were the Archbishop of Trier, [[Baldwin of Luxembourg|Baldwin]], and the [[Archbishop of Cologne]], [[Walram of Jülich|Walram]]. Louis's allies included the Limburg dynasty of [[Gerlach V of Isenburg-Limburg|Gerlach]] and Reinhard of Westerburg. In the course of these disputes, Reinhard captured Grenzau Castle in the [[Westerwald]] mountains. When they attempted to recapture the castle, the troops of Koblenz were ambushed. Following the massacre of 172 Koblenz citizens, Reinhard had to escape and fled to Gerlach at Limburg Castle. Now the Lords of Limburg had the castle as a fiefdom, one third each from the [[Holy Roman Empire|Empire]], the [[Landgrave of Hesse]] and the Archbishop of Trier. Baldwin advanced on the castle in Limburg and demanded that it was opened, citing the feudal treaty. But Gerlach rejected this, because he was only obliged to remain loyal to Baldwin if the feud did not go against the Reich, the Archbishop and the Landgrave. Baldwin withdrew, leaving it as unfinished business.

'''The International Chamber Music Festival''' in [[Plovdiv]]&lt;ref name=website/&gt;&lt;ref name=Visit/&gt;&lt;ref name=Programata/&gt; was founded in 1964 by a group of music enthusiasts,&lt;ref name=BNR/&gt; with the support of the Plovdiv Municipality and the Ministry of Culture.

==History==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2016}}
The first edition of the festival was held from June 1 to June 12, 1964, in the [[Plovdiv Regional Ethnographic Museum|Ethnographic Museum]] in the Old Plovdiv Architectural and Historical Complex.&lt;ref name="Old Plovdiv Architectural and Historical Complex"&gt;[http://oldplovdiv.com/en/index Old Plovdiv Architectural and Historical Complex"]&lt;/ref&gt; From its very beginning this event emerged as a promising creative endeavor, which quickly became an international venue for performances by renowned classical musicians, and a chance for the young musical talents of Bulgaria to witness world-class professionalism. Some of the founders and organizers are Vladimir Avramov, Alexandar Neynski, Dobrin Petkov, Marko Mesholam, the municipal institutions of Plovdiv, and the Bulgarian Concert Agency (Sofia). 
 
With each year the music event established itself as a tradition for the city and the region, featuring in its long history the names of many celebrated musicians, such as Yfrah Neaman, Michael Frischenschlager, the duo Emil Kamilarov and Dina Schneidermann, Stoika Milanova, Yuri Bukov, Mincho Minchev, and many more, premiere performances of musical compositions, celebrations of composers, conductors, ensembles, and solo performers of [[chamber music]]. 
 
During its half-century history the Festival has been organized and managed in different ways and methods, but its invariable aim has been to offer performances by some of the best chamber artists to the Plovdiv audience.

A foundation of the same name was created in the 1980s, and active members in it were the conductor Plamen Djurov, Jivko Jekov (director of the Regional Concert Agency), Georgi Ivanov, and others.

The selection and preparation of the annual festival programs are performed by an advisory board, on which have served distinguished Bulgarian musicians – Anastas Slavchev, Georgi Kanev, Alexandar Spirov, Krikor Chetinyan,  Julian Kujumdziev, Plina Kujumdzieva, Veselin Emanuilov, Adelina Kaludova, Julia Manolova, Polia Paunova-Tosheva, and others.

In 2008 the new market circumstances for the cultural processes in the country demanded the creation and application of a statute for the preparation, organization, and realization of the Festival, as a means and grounds for its renovation and contemporary image. As defined in the established statute, the International Chamber Music Festival – Plovdiv is managed and directed by a coordinating council with the Plovdiv Municipality, presided by the Head of the Culture Department, and producer and organizer is the ‘Interart Fest’ Association. Dimitar Malashinov is a long-standing manager of the Festival.

== Managers ==
During the period 1986–2016 the Festival has been organized by the Muzika Agency, the Interart Fes’ Association, and their long-time manager Dimitar Malashinov.

'''Kon-Tiki''' refers to Scout and Guide raft-building competitions held by [[Scouts South Africa]] and [[Scouts Australia]].

Named after [[Thor Heyerdahl]]'s [[Kon-Tiki]] expedition of 1947, teams of Scouts and Guides age 11 to 17 compete to build and live on a raft for a weekend. Support crews compete in other events while the raft is afloat. 

==South African events==
The Cape Town competition is held at the Sea Scout Base on the banks of [[Zandvlei Estuary Nature Reserve|Zandvlei]], and was first held in the early 1980s. The event starts on the Friday afternoon with teams arriving and starting construction of the raft.  The building criteria are very strict and judging takes place continuously until the raft launch on the Saturday at 2 pm.  Much of the judging is related to safety. 

The Gauteng competition is held at Arrowe Park in [[Benoni, Gauteng]] (previous events held at Murray Park, [[Springs, Gauteng|Springs]]). The first event was held in 1985 at Murray Park.
The competition is run in a very similar fashion to the Cape Town one, with the exception that the rafts launch at 11h00 on the Saturday morning.  There are also numerous other activities and competitions for the support crew to partake in, such as the ''Beaver Challenge'', ''Spare Time Activities'', ''Dress-up competition'' and others. The 2015 theme was "Here be Dragons".

Kon-Tiki events have also been held in [[Port Elizabeth]] in the [[Eastern Cape]]. 

==Australian event==
In 2012, [[Scouts Australia]] (SA Branch) ran the first Kon-tiki Raft Challenge outside South Africa.  The competition was based on that of the South Africans.

'''Kukurá''' (Cucurá, Kokura) is a [[spurious language]], fabricated by an interpreter in Brazil.

When [[Alberto Vojtěch Frič]] visited Rio Verde, Brazil, in 1901 he took with him a [[Pai Tavytera people|Kainguá]] Indian called Guzmán who said he spoke the language of the local ''[[Chavante]]'' people. 
A word list was published for the so-called Kukurá language, thought to be an isolate, in 1931.
In 1932 [[Curt Nimuendajú]], who had visited the Rio Verde in 1909 and 1913, showed that Guzmán's wordlist consisted half of fake words and half of mispronounced [[Guarani language|Guaraní]]. There was no resemblance to the [[Ofayé language]] that was actually spoken in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Campbell|first1=Lyle|last2=Grondona|first2=Verónica|title=The Indigenous Languages of South America: A Comprehensive Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pA-ryJRcG3AC&amp;pg=PA133|accessdate=2013-04-24|date=2012-01-27|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-025803-5|page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Kumaoni holi.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Kumaoni Khari holi, [[Uttarakhand]], [[India]]]] --&gt;

'''Kumauni''' or '''Kumaoni Holi''' (कुमाँऊनी होली), is the historical and cultural celebration of the Hindu festival of [[Holi]] in the region of [[Kumaon division|Kumaon]], [[Uttarakhand]], [[India]]. It is one of the most important festivals for the [[Kumauni people]] as it signifies not only the victory of good over evil but also end of the winter season and the start of the new sowing season which holds great importance for this agricultural community of the [[North Indian]] [[Himalayas]]. It is an amalgamation of the cultural traditions of North India and the local traditions of Kumaon.

The uniqueness of the Kumaoni Holi lies in its being a musical affair, whatever its form, be it the '''Baithki Holi''', the '''Khari Holi''' and the '''Mahila Holi''' all of which start from [[Basant Panchmi]]. 
This results in the festivities of Holi lasting for almost two months in Kumaon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euttaranchal.com/culture/fairs_festivals/kumaoni_holi.php]&lt;/ref&gt; The Baithki Holi and Khari Holi are unique in that the songs on which they are based have a combination of melody, fun, and spiritualism. These songs are essentially based on classical ragas. Baithki Holi is also known as '''Nirvan Ki Holi''' or Holi of Salvation.

Kumauni Holi has characteristics which are very different from Holi celebrations anywhere in the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Kumaon's+'Baithki+Holi'+begins+with+traditional+fervour.-a0220698197]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forms of Holi==
The following are the various forms musical gatherings in which Holi songs are ceremonially sung which are viewed as the start of the Holi celebration. All of these celebrations in the form of musical gatherings start on the [[Basant Panchmi]] Day.

===Origins===
The Origin of the forms of Holi especially '''Baithaki Holi''' musical traditions are in 15th century [[Champawat]] court of the [[Chand Kings]] and the adjoining regions of ''Kalikumaun'', ''Sui'' and ''Gumdesh'' where the musical traditions of Braj mixed with Kumaoni musical traditions. With the spread of Chand rule and integration of Kumaon under them the Holi traditions spread all across Kumaon and acquired their distinct Kumaoni flavour.

===Baithaki Holi===
'''Baithki Holi''' (बैठकी होली), (literally Sitting Holi) is a form of musical gatherg starting from the day of Basant Panchmi held all across Kumaon till the Dulhendi (or the last full moon day of the lunar month [[Phalguna]]). In some areas of Kumaon it starts even earlier at the peak of winter on the first Sunday of the Indian month of Paush that is in the month of December.
 
The Baithaki Holi songs are based on the classical traditions of [[Hindustani Classical Music]] but have heavy influence of Kumaoni folk music traditions.

The Baithki Holi begins from the premises of temples, where ''Holiyars'' (होल्यार), (the singers of Holi songs) as also the people gather to sing songs to the accompaniment of classical music like harmonium and tabla.

[[Kumauni people|Kumaonis]] are very particular about the time when the songs based on [[ragas]] should be sung. For instance, at noon the songs based on [[Pilu]], [[Bhimpalasi]] and Sarang ragas are sung while evening is reserved for the songs based on the ragas like Kalyan, Shyamkalyan and [[Yaman (raga)|Yaman]] etc.

The ''Baithaks'' or sittings are held in the local community centres and even at local homes.

The songs are usually religious in nature and concern tales from the life of the Hindu God [[Krishna]]. Still these ''Baithaks'' are an inter-religious affair as even Muslims and Christians participate in these gatherings.

'''होली राग'''--- 
समुझाय रही राधा नन्द, नन्द कुवर समुझय, होली खेलो फागुन ऋतु आयी,

===Khadi Holi===
'''Khadi Holi''' (खड़ी होली), (literally Standing Holi) usually starts along with but sometimes a little later than Baithaki Holi.
It is mostly celebrated in the rural areas of Kumaon. The songs of the Khari Holi are sung by the people, sporting traditional white ''[[Gandhi cap|nokdaar topi]]'',  ''[[churidar|churidar payajama]]''  and  ''[[kurta]]'', dance in groups to the tune of ethnic musical instruments like the ''Dhol'' and ''Hurka''.
 
Men in groups singing Khadi holi songs which are much more Kumaoni in flavour than the classical renditions of the Baithaki holi visit different homes and greet the members of that house and chant hymns praying for prosperity of the householder. These groups of men are called ''Toli''s.

'''Khadi Holi''' is filled with excitement and frolic as opposed to the more sombre nature of the  Baithaki Holi.
Example of a few commonly sung Khadi holi songs.

They are gatherings similar to Baithaki but composed exclusively of women.

==Rituals==
===Cheer Bandhan and Cheer Dahan===
The Holika bonfire in Kumaun is known as '''Cheer''' (चीर) which is ceremonically made in a ceremony known as ''Cheer Bandhan'' (चीर बंधन) fifteen days before Dulhendi.  The ''Cheer'' is basically a bonfire with a green ''Paiya'' tree branch in the middle.
The ''Cheer'' of every village and mohalla is rigorously guarded as rival mohallas try to steal the others ''cheer''. The cheer is the centre of the festivities. 

The Cheer is burnt on the night before Holi and is known as ''Cheer Dahan'' is symbolic of the victory of the pious [[Prahlad]] over his evil father's plans.

===Chharadi===
Dulhendi known as '''Chharadi''' (छरड़ी), in [[Kumaoni language|Kumaoni]] (from ''Chharad'' (छरड़), or natural colours made from flower extracts, ash and water) is celebrated with great gusto much in the same way as all across North India.
Principal ingredients of the celebration are Abeer and Gulal, in all possible colours. Next comes squirting of coloured water using pichkaris. Coloured water is prepared using Tesu flowers, which are first gathered from the trees, dried in the sun, and then ground up, and later mixed with water to produce orange-yellow coloured water. Another traditional Holi item now rarely seen is a red powder enclosed in globes of Lakh, which break instantly and cover the party with the powder.

===Shubh Kamna===
The culmination of the holi celebrations takes place with throwing ''abeer'', ''gulal'' in the air and reciting out aloud in unison the following prayer in [[Kumaoni language|Kumaoni]] for a healthy and prosperous year ahead.

हो हो हो लख रे (may you live a hundred thousand years)

हमार आमा बुबू जी रौला सौ लाख बरिस (may our grandparents live for a hundred thousand years)
   
हमार इजा बौजू जी रौला सौ लाख बरिस (may our parents live for a hundred thousand years)
 
हमार दाज्यू भौजी जी रौला सौ लाख बरिस (may our brothers and their families live for a hundred thousand years)
   
हो हो हो लख रे (may you live a hundred thousand years)

==Cuisine==
Special culinary preparations for Holi include ''[[gujia]]'' (fried dumpling filled with a sweet filling of roasted khoya, a milk extract, and dry fruits and nuts) and ''Aaloo Gutuk'' (आलू गुटुक), which is fried potatoes seasoned with ''jamboo'' (a Himalayan spice).

==Significance==
Apart from its symbolic significance of victory of pious [[Prahlad]] over his evil father  [[Hiranyakashipu]]'s plans. In Kumaon holi also signifies the end of the long Himalayan winter and the beginning of a new sowing season which is to be celebrated it also means a break from the rigorous life of hard agricultural labour for a few days for the Kumaoni peasantry.

'''''Love Child''''' was an Australian television drama program that follows the lives of staff and residents of the fictional [[Kings Cross, New South Wales|Kings Cross]] Hospital and Stanton House in Sydney, starting in 1969 and continuing into the 1970s.

The program was created by [[Sarah Lambert]] and was first broadcast on the [[Nine Network]] on 17 February 2014. The program is based on the real life [[forced adoption in Australia]] for which former Prime Minister [[Julia Gillard]] offered a national apology to those affected in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dss.gov.au/our-responsibilities/families-and-children/programs-services/forced-adoption-practices]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Love Child'' was renewed for a second series on 2 March 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://if.com.au/2014/03/02/article/Second-season-for-Love-Child/IRERLZBZEX.html|title=Second season for Love Child|date=2 March 2014|publisher=InterMedia|accessdate=2 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series was renewed for a third series on 23 February 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvtonight.com.au/2015/02/renewed-love-child-2.html|title=Renewed: Love Child|date=23 February 2015|publisher=TV Tonight|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series was renewed for a fourth series on 8 November 2016 at Nine's upfronts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2016/11/upfronts-2017-nine-highlights.html|title=Nine's Upfronts 2017|date=8 November 2016|publisher=TV Tonight|accessdate=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Monkey Man of New Delhi''' ([[Hindi]]: 'Kala Bandar') is a monster which was reported roaming [[Delhi]] in mid-2001.

==History==
In May 2001, reports began to circulate in the Indian [[Capital city|capital]] New Delhi of a strange [[monkey]]-like creature that was appearing at night and attacking people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rediff.com/news/2001/may/18mon2.htm It's a man! It's a monkey! It's a...]; by Onkar Singh in New Delhi; May 18, 2001; Rediff India. [http://www.rediff.com/news/2001/may/18mon.htm 'Monkey man' keeps Delhi awake again]; May 18, 2001; Rediff India. . Also see [http://www.rediff.com/news/2001/may/15myst.htm], [http://www.rediff.com/news/2001/may/16myst.htm], [http://www.rediff.com/news/2001/may/17mon1.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Eyewitness accounts were often inconsistent, but tended to describe the creature as about four feet (120&amp;nbsp;cm) tall,&lt;ref name="TOI_26Jun2010_DesiTales_MonkeymanofDelhi"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/India/Desi-fables/articleshow/6094485.cms|title=Desi fables - The Times of India|date=26 June 2010|work=[[Indiatimes]]|accessdate=25 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; covered in thick black hair, with a metal helmet, metal claws, glowing red eyes and three buttons on its chest; others, however, described the Monkey-man as having a more vulpine snout, and being up to eight feet tall, and muscular; it would leap from building to building.{{fact|date=April 2018}}

Many people reported being scratched, and two&lt;ref name="TOI_26Jun2010_DesiTales_MonkeymanofDelhi"/&gt; (by some reports, three) people even died when they leapt from the tops of buildings or fell down stairwells in a panic caused by what they thought was the attacker. At one point, exasperated police even issued artist's impression drawings in an attempt to catch the creature. 

Upon investigation the police have found reports of a Maruti alto always driving rashly away from the crime scene followed by a trail of 275 Classic mild cigarette butts on the ground.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=November 2018}}

==In popular culture==
The appearance of Monkey man in [[Old Delhi]] is the centre-point of the 2009 [[Bollywood]] [[Hindi]] film ''[[Delhi-6]]'' directed by [[Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra]]. In the film, the creature, called in [[Hindi]] as ''"Kala Bandar (Black Monkey)"'' is used as an allegory to represent the evil that resides inside every man alongside God (virtue). The monkey man has never actually been caught on tape.

In the 2011 graphic novel [[Munkeeman]] by [[Tere Bin Laden]] director [[Abhishek Sharma (director)|Abhishek Sharma]], the creature is interpreted as a misunderstood superhero, who is the result of a science experiment gone wrong. The first edition, Munkeeman Vol 1 chronicled the creatures brief appearance in Delhi, and the second edition will feature the creature in Kanpur, based on the incidents reported in February 2002.

'''Mortsafes''' were contraptions designed to protect [[grave]]s from disturbance. [[Resurrectionists in the United Kingdom|Resurrectionists]] had supplied the schools of anatomy in [[Scotland]] since the early 18th century. This was due to the necessity for [[medical student]]s to learn [[anatomy]] by attending [[dissection]]s of human subjects, which was frustrated by the very limited allowance of dead bodies - for example the corpses of executed criminals - granted by the government, which controlled the supply.&lt;ref&gt;Holder, Geoff (2010). ''Scottish Bodysnatchers''. Port Stroud : The History Press. {{ISBN|978-0-7524-5603-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Official inaction==
The authorities turned a blind eye to the grave-rifling because surgeons and students were working to advance medical knowledge. They kept publicity to a minimum to prevent people from realising what was happening. The cases of grave-robbing that came to light caused riots, damage to property and even fatal attacks. In the early 19th century, with the great increase in numbers of schools and students, there was continual rifling of lonely graveyards, fights in city burial grounds and other disturbances. Men were employed to steal bodies and transport them from place to place, even across the sea, for sale to medical schools. Revelations led to public outrage, particularly in Scotland, where there was great reverence for the dead and a literal belief in the [[Resurrection]]. It was popularly believed that the dead could not rise in an incomplete state.&lt;ref&gt;W Roughead, ed., Burke And Hare, Notable British Trials Series, William Hodge and Company Limited 1948, p.3:&lt;/ref&gt;

==Precautions==
Many people were determined to protect the graves of newly deceased friends and relatives. The rich could afford heavy table tombstones, [[Burial vault (tomb)|vaults]], [[Mausoleum|mausolea]] and iron cages around graves. The poor began to place flowers and pebbles on graves to detect disturbances. They dug heather and branches into the soil to make disinterment more difficult. Large stones, often coffin-shaped, sometimes the gift of a wealthy man to the parish, were placed over new graves. Friends and relatives took turns or hired men to watch graves through the hours of darkness. Watch-houses were sometimes erected to shelter the watchers. One watch-house in [[Edinburgh]] is a three-storey castellated building with windows. Watching societies were often formed in towns, one in [[Glasgow]] having 2,000 members. Many [[Session (Presbyterian)|kirk session houses]] were used by watchers, but graves were still violated.

==The mortsafe==
[[File:Mortsafe, Greyfriars Kirk.jpg|thumb|left|Mortsafe in Greyfriars Kirkyard, Edinburgh]]
The mortsafe was invented in about 1816. These were iron or iron-and-stone devices of great weight, in many different designs. Often they were complex heavy iron contraptions of rods and plates, [[padlock]]ed together - examples have been found close to all Scottish medical schools. A plate was placed over the coffin and rods with heads were pushed through holes in it. These rods were kept in place by locking a second plate over the first to form extremely heavy protection. It would be removed by two people with keys. They were placed over the coffins for about six weeks, then removed for further use when the body inside was sufficiently decayed. There is a model of a mortsafe of this type in [[Marischal Museum]], [[Aberdeen]]. Sometimes a church bought them and hired them out. Societies were also formed to purchase them and control their use, with annual membership fees, and charges made to non-members.

==Vaults and watch-houses==
[[File:Watchtower, Dalkeith Cemetery.jpg|thumb|Watchtower built in [[Dalkeith]] town cemetery, near Edinburgh, in 1827]]
Publicity surrounding the crimes of [[Burke and Hare]] heightened the fear felt by many people. It was about this time that vaults - repositories for dead bodies - were built by public subscription in Scotland, with their use governed by rules and regulations. Some of these were above ground while others - mainly in [[Aberdeenshire (historic)|Aberdeenshire]] - were wholly or partly underground. In one village, Udny Green, in Aberdeenshire there is a unique [[Udny Mort House|morthouse]], a circular building with a thick studded wooden door and an inner iron door. Inside there is turntable to accommodate seven coffins. A coffin would be moved round as further ones were added and by the time it reappeared the body would be of no use to the dissectionists. 

Probably all communities near the Scottish schools of medicine in Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen employed some means of protecting the dead. Some used both mortsafes and watching. There are watch-houses in the remoter Scottish areas, in the Borders, and two have been found in the English county of [[Northumberland]].

==Surviving mortsafes==

[[File:Mortsafe in Colinton Kirkyard.jpg|thumb|Iron coffin mortsafe in [[Colinton]], once a village outside Edinburgh]]
The mortsafes are mainly lying in churchyards and burial grounds; some are very broken and rusting away. One has been restored and hung in a church porch, with an explanatory note, by the [[East Lothian]] Antiquary Society. There are one or two in museums but those on display rarely have any indication of what they are or how they were used. Some documents appertaining to mortsafes and other protection devices are still in existence in libraries and record offices. There are two mortsafes in reasonable condition outside the old Aberfoyle church in Stirling, which was fully 30 miles from the nearest School of Anatomy in Glasgow.  One can also be found, in a slightly rusted state, to the right of the door outside [[Skene Parish Church]], [[Kirkton of Skene]], Aberdeenshire.   Another in reasonable condition can be found in the kirkyard at the remote hamlet of [[Towie, Aberdeenshire|Towie]], west of [[Alford, Aberdeenshire|Alford]]. [[Tullibody]], as well as having a famous stone coffin, is also recorded to have had an iron coffin case as an attempt to thwart local body-snatchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hallen|first1=A. W.

'''The Port Huron Project''',  is a series of six reenactments of [[protest]] speeches from the [[New Left]] movements of the 1960s and '70s. Each event takes place at the site of the original speech, and is delivered by a performer to an audience of invited guests and passers-by. Videos, audio recordings, and photographs of these performances are presented in various venues and distributed online and on DVD as open-source media.

== Previous Reenactments ==
'''Port Huron Project 1: ''Until the Last Gun Is Silent''' [http://www.nothing.org/porthuronproject/reenactments.html#PHP1]
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:CSK for Wiki.jpg|thumb|right|In September, 2006 Gina Brown delivered the first speech in the Port Huron Project series.]] --&gt;
The first reenactment took place on September 16, 2006 and was based on a speech given by [[Coretta Scott King]] at a peace march in [[Central Park]] on April 27, 1968, approximately three weeks after her husband, [[Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr]]., was assassinated. The speech, which was based on notes found in Dr. King's pockets, addresses the war in Vietnam, domestic poverty, and the power of women to effect social change. Gina Brown, a New York-based actor and former welfare mother, delivered the speech.

'''Port Huron Project 2: ''The Problem Is Civil Obedience''' [http://www.nothing.org/porthuronproject/reenactments.html#PHP2]
[[Image:MeghanBoudreau4.jpg|thumb|left|Matthew Floyd Miller on the [[Boston Common (park)|Boston Common]] in July, 2007 reenacting a speech by Howard Zinn.]]
The second event in the series took place on July 14, 2007. It was based on a speech originally delivered by author and activist [[Howard Zinn]] at a peace march on Boston Common on May 5, 1971. In this speech, Zinn defended the use of civil disobedience to protest the war in Vietnam and called on Congress to impeach the president and vice president of the United States for the "high crime" of "making war on the peasants of Southeast Asia."

'''Port Huron Project 3: ''We Must Name the System''' [http://www.nothing.org/porthuronproject/reenactments.html]
[[Image:Max Bunzle.JPG|thumb|right|Max Bunzel delivering an antiwar speech by Paul Potter.]]The third reenactment was staged near the Washington Monument on the National Mall in Washington, D.C on July 26, 2007. The original speech was given at the April 17, 1965 March on Washington To End the War in Vietnam by [[Students for a Democratic Society (1960 organization)|Students for a Democratic Society]] (SDS) President [[Paul Potter]]. Potter offered an insightful critique of our government’s use of the rhetoric of freedom to justify war, and calls for citizens of the United States to create a massive social movement to build a “democratic and humane society in which Vietnams are unthinkable.”

Selection criteria for the Port Huron Project include identifying New Left protest speeches, finding transcripts and/or recordings, and determining the locations in which specific speeches were given. Attention is given to speeches that were delivered at protests or demonstrations in public spaces and address issues of peace and social justice.

[[File:Potsdam big three.jpg|thumb|320px|The "Big Three": Attlee, Truman, Stalin]]

The '''Potsdam Agreement''' ({{lang-de|Potsdamer Abkommen}}) was the August 1945 agreement between three of the [[Allies of World War II]], the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States]], and the [[Soviet Union]]. It concerned the military occupation and reconstruction of [[Allied-occupied Germany|Germany]], its [[Former eastern territories of Germany|borders]], and the entire [[European Theatre of World War II|European Theatre of War]] territory. It also addressed Germany's [[demilitarisation]], [[German reparations for World War II|reparations]] and the prosecution of [[war criminal]]s.

Executed as a communiqué, the agreement was not a [[peace treaty]] according to [[international law]], although it created accomplished facts. It was superseded by the [[Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany]] signed on 12 September 1990.

As De Gaulle had not been invited to the Conference, the French resisted implementing the Potsdam Agreements within their occupation zone.  In particular, the French refused to resettle any expelled Germans from the east. Moreover, the French did not accept any obligation to abide by the Potsdam Agreement in the proceedings of the Allied Control Council; in particular resisting all proposals to establish common policies and institutions across Germany as a whole, and anything that they feared might lead to the emergence of an eventual unified German government.&lt;ref name="Ziemke 1990 114"&gt;{{cite book|last= Ziemke| first = Earl Frederick| title = The US Army and the Occupation of Germany 1944-1946| publisher = Center of Military History, United States Army| date = 1990| pages = 345}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
After the [[end of World War II in Europe]] (1939–45), and the decisions of the earlier [[Tehran Conference|Tehran]], [[Casablanca Conference|Casablanca]] and [[Yalta Conference]]s, the Allies by the [[Berlin Declaration (1945)|Berlin Declaration]] of June 5, 1945, had assumed supreme authority over Germany. In the ''Three Power Conference of Berlin'' (formal title of the [[Potsdam Conference]]) from 17 July to 2 August 1945, they agreed to and adopted the ''Protocol of the Proceedings, August 1, 1945'', signed at [[Cecilienhof]] Castle in [[Potsdam]]. The signatories were General Secretary [[Joseph Stalin]], President [[Harry S. Truman]], and Prime Minister [[Clement Attlee]], who, as a result of the [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|British general election of 1945]], had replaced [[Winston Churchill]] as the UK's representative. The three powers also agreed to invite [[France]] and [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|China]] to participate as members of Council of Foreign Ministers established to oversee the agreement. The [[Provisional Government of the French Republic]] accepted the invitation on August 7, with the key reservation that it would not accept ''a priori'' any commitment to the eventual reconstitution of a central government in Germany.

==Protocol==
{{Territorial evolution of Germany}}
{{Territorial evolution of Poland}}
In the Potsdam Agreement (Berlin Conference) the Allies (UK, USSR, USA) agree:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Senate Committee on Foreign Relations|title=A Decade of American Foreign Policy: Basic Documents, 1941-49|date=1950|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|location=Washington, DC|url=http://www.nato.int/ebookshop/video/declassified/doc_files/Potsdam%20Agreement.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Establishment of a [[Council of Foreign Ministers]], also including France and China; tasked the preparation of a peace settlement for Germany, to be accepted by the Government of Germany once a government adequate for the purpose had been established.
#:See the London Conference of Foreign Ministers and the [[Moscow Conference (1945)|Moscow Conference]] which took place later in 1945.
#The principles to govern the treatment of Germany in the initial control period.
#:See [[European Advisory Commission]] and [[Allied Control Council]]
#*A. Political principles.
#: Post-war Germany to be divided into four Occupation Zones under the control of Britain, the Soviet Union, the United States and France; with the Commanders-in-chief of each country's forces exercising sovereign authority over matters within their own zones, while exercising authority jointly through the Allied Control Council for 'Germany as a whole'. 
#:[[Democratization]]. Treatment of Germany as a single unit. Disarmament and [[Demilitarization]]. Elimination of all [[Nazism|Nazi]] influence.
#*B. Economic principles.
#:Reduction or destruction of all civilian heavy-industry with war-potential, such as shipbuilding, machine production and chemical factories. Restructuring of German economy towards agriculture and light-industry.
#[[German reparations for World War II|Reparations from Germany]].
#:This section covered reparation claims of the USSR from the [[Soviet occupation zone]] in Germany.  The section also agreed that 10% of the industrial capacity of the western zones unnecessary for the German peace economy should be transferred to the Soviet Union within two years. The Soviet Union withdrew its previous objections to French membership of the Allied Reparations Commission, which had been established in Moscow following the Yalta conference.
# Disposal of the [[Kriegsmarine|German Navy]] and merchant marine.
#:All but thirty submarines to be sunk and the rest of the German Navy was to be divided equally between the three powers.
#:The German merchant marine was to be divided equally between the three powers, and they would distribute some of those ships to the other Allies. But until the end of the war with the [[Empire of Japan]] all the ships would remain under the authority of the Combined Shipping Adjustment Board and the United Maritime Authority.
# City of [[Königsberg]] and the adjacent area (then [[East Prussia]], now [[Kaliningrad Oblast]]).
#:The United States and Britain declared that they would support the transfer of Königsberg and the adjacent area to the Soviet Union at the peace conference.
#War criminals
#: This was a short paragraph and covered the creation of the [[London Charter]] and the subsequent [[Nuremberg Trials]]:
#:&lt;blockquote&gt;The Three Governments have taken note of the discussions which have been proceeding in recent weeks in London between British, United States, Soviet and French representatives with a view to reaching agreement on the methods of trial of those major war criminals whose crimes under the [[Moscow Declaration]] of October 1943 have no particular geographical localization. The Three Governments reaffirm their intention to bring these criminals to swift and sure justice. They hope that the negotiations in London will result in speedy agreement being reached for this purpose, and they regard it as a matter of great importance that the trial of these major criminals should begin at the earliest possible date. The first list of defendants will be published before 1st September.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
#[[Allied-occupied Austria|Austria]]:
#:The government of Austria was to be decided after British and American forces entered [[Vienna]], and that Austria should not pay any reparations.
#[[People's Republic of Poland|Poland]]
#:There should be a [[Provisional Government of National Unity]] recognised by all three powers, and that those Poles who were serving in British Army formations should be free to return to Poland. The provisional western border should be the [[Oder–Neisse line]], with territories to the east of this excluded from the Soviet Occupation zone and placed under Polish and Soviet administration. Poland would receive former German territories in the north and west, but the final delimitation of the western frontier of Poland should await the peace settlement; which eventually took place as the [[Treaty on the Final Settlement With Respect to Germany]] in 1990.
# Conclusion on peace treaties and admission to the [[United Nations]] organization.
#:See [[Moscow Conference of Foreign Ministers]] which took place later in 1945.
#:It was noted that [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Italy]] had fought on the side of the Allies and was making good progress towards establishment of a democratic government and institutions and that after the peace treaty the three Allies would support an application from a democratic Italian government for membership of the United Nations. Further
#:&lt;blockquote&gt;[t]he three Governments have also charged the Council of Foreign Ministers with the task of preparing peace treaties for [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[Finland]], [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–1946)|Hungary]] and [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]]. The conclusion of Peace Treaties with recognized democratic governments in these States will also enable the three Governments to support applications from them for membership of the United Nations. The three Governments agree to examine each separately in the near future in the light of the conditions then prevailing, the establishment of diplomatic relations with Finland, Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary to the extent possible prior to the conclusion of peace treaties with those countries.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
#:The details were discussed later that year at the Moscow Conference of Foreign Ministers and the treaties were signed in 1947 at the [[Paris Peace Conference (1947)|Paris Peace Conference]]  
#:By that time the governments of Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary were Communist. 
#Territorial Trusteeship
#:Italian former colonies would be decided in connection with the preparation of a peace treaty for Italy. Like most of the other former European Axis powers the Italian peace treaty was signed at the 1947 Paris Peace Conference.
#Revised [[Allied Control Commission]] procedure in Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary
#:Now that hostilities in Europe were at an end the Western Allies should have a greater input into the Control Commissions of Central and Eastern Europe, the Annex to this agreement included detailed changes to the workings of the [[Allied Commission#Hungary|Hungarian Control Commission]].
#Orderly transfer of German Populations
#:Main article [[Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944–50)]]
#:&lt;blockquote&gt;The Three Governments, having considered the question in all its aspects, recognize that the transfer to Germany of German populations, or elements thereof, remaining in Poland, [[Czechoslovakia]] and Hungary, will have to be undertaken. They agree that any transfers that take place should be effected in an orderly and humane manner.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
#:"German populations, or elements thereof, remaining in Poland" refers to Germans living within the 1937 boundaries of Poland up to the [[Curzon line]] going East. In theory, that German ethnic population could have been expelled to the Polish temporarily administered territories of [[Silesia Province|Silesia]], [[Farther Pomerania]], East Prussia and eastern [[Province of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]].
#:Because the [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany]] were under great strain, the Czechoslovak government, the Polish provisional government and the control council in Hungary were asked to submit an estimate of the time and rate at which further transfers could be carried out having regard to the present situation in Germany and suspend further expulsions until these estimates were integrated into plans for an equitable distribution of these "removed" Germans among the several zones of occupation.
#Oil equipment in Romania
#[[Iran]]
#:Allied troops were to withdraw immediately from [[Tehran]] and that further stages of the withdrawal of troops from Iran should be considered at the meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers to be held in London in September 1945.
#The international zone of [[Tangier]].
#:The city of Tangier and the area around it should remain international and discussed further.
#The Black sea straits.
#:The [[Montreux Convention]] should be revised and that this should be discussed with the Turkish government.
#International inland waterways
#European inland transport conference.
#Directives to the military commanders on allied control council for Germany.
#Use of Allied property for satellite reparations or war trophies
#:These were detailed in Annex II
#Military Talks

*Annex II

Moreover, towards concluding the [[Pacific War|Pacific Theatre of War]], the Potsdam Conference issued the [[Potsdam Declaration]], the Proclamation Defining Terms for Japanese Surrender (26 July 1945) wherein the Western Allies (UK, US, USSR) and the [[National Government of the Republic of China#1927–49|Nationalist China]] of General [[Chiang Kai-shek]] asked Japan to surrender or be destroyed.

==Aftermath==
Already during the Potsdam Conference, on 30 July 1945, the [[Allied Control Council]] was constituted in Berlin to execute the Allied resolutions (the "Four Ds"):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=United States Department of State|title=Foreign Relations of the United States, 1949, Council of Foreign Ministers; Germany and Austria, Volume III Document 461|url=https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1949v03/d461|publisher=Office of the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs|accessdate=28 June 2017|date=24 May 1949}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Denazification|url=http://www.alliiertenmuseum.de/en/topics/denazification.html|website=Alliierten Museum|publisher=Federal Government Commissioner for Culture and the Media|accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Denazification]] of the German society to eradicate [[Nazism|Nazi]] influence
*[[Demilitarization]] of the former [[Wehrmacht]] forces and the German [[arms industry]]; however, the circumstances of the [[Cold War]] soon led to Germany's ''[[Wiederbewaffnung]]'' including the re-establishment of both the [[Bundeswehr]] and the [[National People's Army]] resp.
*[[Democratization]], including the formation of [[political party|political parties]] and [[trade union]]s, [[freedom of speech]], of the [[freedom of the press|press]] and [[freedom of religion|religion]]
*[[Decentralization]] resulting in [[Federalism in Germany|German federalism]], along with disassemblement as part of the [[industrial plans for Germany]]. Dismantling was stopped in [[West Germany]] in 1951 according to the [[Truman Doctrine]], whereafter [[East Germany]] had to cope with the impact alone.

===Territorial changes===
The northern half of the German province of [[East Prussia]], occupied by the [[Red Army]] during its [[East Prussian Offensive]] followed by its [[Evacuation of East Prussia|evacuation]] in winter 1945, had already been incorporated into Soviet territory as the [[Kaliningrad Oblast]]. The Western Allies promised to support the annexation of the territory north of the [[Braniewo|Braunsberg]]–[[Gołdap|Goldap]] line when a Final German Peace Treaty was held.

The Allies had acknowledged the legitimacy of the Polish [[Provisional Government of National Unity]], which was about to form a Soviet [[satellite state]]. Urged by Stalin, the UK and the US gave in to put the German territories east of the [[Oder–Neisse line]] from the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] coast west of [[Świnoujście]] up to the [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak]] border "under Polish administration"; allegedly confusing the [[Lusatian Neisse]] and the [[Nysa Kłodzka|Glatzer Neisse]] rivers. The proposal of an Oder-[[Bóbr|Bober]]-[[Kwisa|Queis]] line was rejected by the Soviet delegation. The cession included the former [[Free City of Danzig]] and the seaport of [[Szczecin|Stettin]] on the mouth of the [[Oder]] River ([[Szczecin Lagoon]]), vital for the [[Upper Silesian Industrial Region]].

Post-war, 'Germany as a whole' would consist solely of aggregate territories of the respective zones of occupation. As all former German territories east of the Oder-Neisse line were excluded from the Soviet Occupation Zone, they were consequently excluded from 'Germany as a whole'.

===Expulsions===
{{Expulsion of Germans}}
{{main|Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944–50)}}
In the course of the proceedings, [[Polish communism|Polish communists]] had begun to suppress the German population west of the Bóbr river to underline their demand for a border on the Lusatian Neisse. The Allied resolution on the "orderly transfer" of German population became the legitimation of the expulsion of Germans from the nebulous parts of [[Central Europe]], if they had not already fled from the advancing Red Army.

The expulsion of ethnic Germans by the Poles concerned, in addition to Germans within areas behind the 1937 Polish border in the West (such as in most of the old Prussian province of West Prussia), the territories placed "under Polish administration" pending a Final German Peace Treaty, i.e. southern East Prussia ([[Masuria]]), [[Farther Pomerania]], the [[New March]] region of the former [[Province of Brandenburg]], the districts of the ''Grenzmark'' [[Posen-West Prussia]], [[Lower Silesia]] and those parts of [[Upper Silesia]] that had remained with Germany after the 1921 [[Upper Silesia plebiscite]]. It further affected the German minority living within the territory of the former [[Second Polish Republic]] in [[Greater Poland]], eastern Upper Silesia, [[Chełmno Land]] and the [[Polish Corridor]] with Danzig.

The [[Germans in Czechoslovakia (1918–1938)|Germans in Czechoslovakia]], known as [[Sudeten Germans]] but also [[Carpathian Germans]], were expelled from the ''[[Sudetenland]]'' region where they formed a majority, from linguistic enclaves in central [[Bohemia]] and [[Moravia]], as well as from the city of [[Prague]].

Though the Potsdam Agreement only refers to Poland, Czechoslovakia and [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–1946)|Hungary]], expulsions also occurred in [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], where the [[Transylvanian Saxons]] were [[Deportation of Germans from Romania after World War II|deported]] and their property disseized, and in [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]. In the Soviet territories, Germans not only were expelled from northern East Prussia ([[Oblast Kaliningrad]]) but also from the adjacent Lithuanian [[Klaipeda Region]] and other lands settled by [[Baltic Germans]].

'''Rites of Spring''' is an annual music festival held at [[Vanderbilt University]] in [[Nashville]], [[Tennessee]] in late April.

== History ==
The history of the festival is explained on the Rites of Spring website:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://studentorg.vanderbilt.edu/ros/history/|title=History|date=2011-02-01|work=Rites of Spring|access-date=2018-06-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|During the late 1960s and early 1970s Vanderbilt students, faculty, and administrators went to great lengths to increase the amount of contact the school had with the Nashville community. One example of this community outreach was the student-formed "Free University" which offered instruction to Nashville residents in topics ranging from short wave radio to the arts. The "open campus" policy also resulted in many Nashville residents taking part in Vanderbilt campus events such as the implementation of the Rites of Spring Music Festival in 1971.}}

'''The Sackler Distinguished Lectures''' are an endowed annual lecture series, bringing an outstanding mathematician to Israel every year. The lectures are given at [[Tel Aviv University]]. They are supported by Raymond R. Sackler (a brother of [[Arthur M. Sackler]]) and his wife, Beverly, philanthropists with a commitment to support scientific research.

The first lecture series took place in 1980.

"'''Sex Type Thing'''" is the debut single released in 1993 by American [[rock music|rock]] band [[Stone Temple Pilots]] from their debut studio album, ''[[Core (Stone Temple Pilots album)|Core]]''. "Sex Type Thing" also appears on the greatest hits compilation album ''[[Thank You (Stone Temple Pilots album)|Thank You]]''. The song spawned a [[music video]] which received moderate rotation on [[MTV]] (at the height of the early 1990s [[grunge]] music scene). The single peaked at number 23 on the US [[Mainstream Rock Tracks|Album Rock Tracks]] chart.

==Lyrics and composition==
[[Scott Weiland]] wrote the lyrics after a girl he was dating was [[rape]]d by three high school football players after a party. Weiland has stated the song is an anti-rape statement, not a song simply about sex, saying:

{{quote|This song is really not about sex at all. It's about control, violence and abuse of power.&lt;ref&gt;"''{{cite web |url=http://belowempty.com/Discography/index.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-07-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070928022804/http://belowempty.com/Discography/index.php |archivedate=2007-09-28 |df= }}". below empty. Retrieved 2005-06-13.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to guitarist [[Dean DeLeo]], the song "[[In the Light]]" by [[Led Zeppelin]] had a direct influence on the main riff in "Sex Type Thing".&lt;ref&gt;"''{{cite web |url=http://belowempty.com/Discography/index.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-07-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070928022804/http://belowempty.com/Discography/index.php |archivedate=2007-09-28 |df= }}". below empty.

In an October 1997 interview in ''Seconds'' magazine, [[Glenn Danzig]] mentions the similarity of the main riff to the [[Danzig (band)|Danzig]] song "[[Danzig II: Lucifuge|Snakes of Christ]]".

==Live performances==
Over the years, "Sex Type Thing" became the band's traditional closer at live shows. During some performances from 1999 until STP's 2002 break-up, the band would extend the song's ending into a jam session where Weiland would strip naked in front of the audience and then wrap his lower body in an [[Flag of the United States|American flag]].

==Music video==
During the grunge explosion of the 1990s, the music video for "Sex Type Thing" is usually denoted as the single factor that drove Stone Temple Pilots into the scene. The video was in medium-heavy rotation on MTV during the time, and helped make STP a contender in the grunge era. The video itself hosts a very dark motif, showing the band performing in a [[dungeon]] chamber, with singer Scott Weiland having bleached his hair blond, interspersed between clips of a dancer swinging on a chain and a woman surrounded by a ring of fire. This video is rather distinctive because it is the first to showcase [[Scott Weiland|Scott Weiland's]] trademark "dance".&lt;ref&gt;"''https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-s3lmr09oVg

The set was used again for [[Sunny Day Real Estate]]'s "In Circles" music video in 1994. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SUNNY DAY REAL ESTATE “IN CIRCLES”|url=http://russellbates.com/work/sunny-day-real-estate-in-circles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Upon the success of "Sex Type Thing", controversies regarding the song's lyrics emerged while STP was on tour opening for [[Megadeth]]. Weiland found himself in the position of defending "Sex Type Thing" to individuals who took the first-person approach he used in the song ("I am a man, a man/I'll give ya something that ya won't forget/I said ya shouldn't have worn that dress") literally. In a 1993 interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', Weiland expressed his frustration with the song's reception by saying "It was, 'All right, the "[[Cop Killer (song)|Cop Killer]]" controversy's dead, let's try to find something else'...I never thought that people would ever seriously think that I was an advocate of date rape."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belowempty.com/articles.php?s=story&amp;id=9|title= Hard To The Core|date=August 1, 1993|work=|publisher=|accessdate=April 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''South Mountain Concert Hall''' is a historic performance hall on New South Mountain Road in [[Pittsfield, Massachusetts]].  Founded in 1918 by [[Chicago]] native [[Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge]], it has been home to a [[classical music]] summer performance series since then, featuring name performers including [[Leonard Bernstein]], [[Rudolf Serkin]], and major [[chamber music]] ensembles.  The hall was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1973, and the extensive estate grounds are open to the public as a nature preserve.&lt;ref name=MACRIS/&gt;

==History==
South Mountain was founded in 1918 by [[Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge]], who had moved to the Berkshires in a bid to improve her husband's health.  A longtime supporter of [[chamber music]], Mrs. Coolidge in 1916 established the [[Berkshire String Quartet]], which at first gave concerts in her home.&lt;ref name=MACRIS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mhc-macris.net/Details.aspx?MhcId=PIT.327|title=MACRIS inventory record for South Mountain Concert Hall|publisher=Commonwealth of Massachusetts|accessdate=2013-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two years later she had the performance hall built on her property that continues in use today.&lt;ref name=SMC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southmountainconcerts.org/|title=South Mountain Concerts|publisher=South Mountain Concerts|accessdate=2013-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hall has played host to a large number of well-known classical music performers, including [[Peter Serkin]], [[Leontyne Price]], the [[Guarneri String Quartet]], the [[Juilliard Quartet]], and others.  It has been the setting for world premiere performances of works by [[Bela Bartok|Bartok]], [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]], [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel]], and [[Arnold Schoenberg|Schoenberg]].  The first complete cycle of the 24 chamber works of [[Johannes Brahms]] was given here in 1924.&lt;ref name=NRHP&gt;{{cite web|url=https://catalog.archives.gov/id/63794358|title=NRHP nomination for South Mountain Concert Hall|publisher=National Archive|accessdate=2018-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Setting and architecture==
South Mountain is set on {{convert|200|acre|ha}} of primarily woodland, formerly part of the Coolidge estate.  The grounds are operated by the non-profit that manages the facility as a nature preserve open to the public on a year-round basis.  The hall is a single-story timber-frame structure, built to resemble a church.  It has a hip roof with a cupola, at the center, and a [[porte cochere]] at the main entrance on one of the long sides.  The long side opposite the entrance has five bays, each of which is fitted with a [[French door]], and there are casement-style windows above them for ventilation.   The main timbers for the building were taken from an old textile mill, and the seats were pews taken from a church.  The interior is finished with old wooden paneling.  The hall is sited adjacent to an open lawn, from which the music can also be heard.&lt;ref name=NRHP/&gt;  In addition to the hall Mrs. Coolidge had cabins built to provide housing for performers.

{{About|an economic boom between 1959 and 1974| more recent economic developments|Economy of Spain}}

[[Image:Torre de Madrid 01.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The 142m high ''[[Torre de Madrid]]'', built in 1957, heralded the "Spanish Miracle".]]

The '''Spanish miracle''' ({{lang-es|El Milagro español}}, literally "The Spanish Miracle") was the name given to a broadly based economic boom in [[Spain under Franco|Spain]] from 1959 to 1974. It was brought to an end by the international [[1970s energy crisis|oil]] and [[stagflation]] crises of the 1970s.

==History==

=== Initiation of the boom ===
The "economic miracle" was initiated by the reforms promoted by the so-called [[Technocracy (bureaucratic)|technocrat]]s who, with [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]'s approval, put in place policies developed in Spain. The technocrats, many of whom were members of [[Opus Dei]], were a new breed of politicians who replaced the old [[falangist]] guard.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, Geoffrey. "Franco: Soldier, Commander, Dictator". Washington D.C.: Potomac Books, Inc., 2005. p. 110-111.&lt;/ref&gt; The implementation of these policies took the form of [[economic development|development]] plans ({{lang-es|Planes de desarrollo}}) and it was largely a success: Spain enjoyed the second highest growth rate in the world, only slightly behind [[Japan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Before China's Transformation, There Was The "Spanish Miracle"|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/timreuter/2014/05/19/before-chinas-transformation-there-was-the-spanish-miracle/#186c2ed3b3e1|author=Reuter, Tim|date=May 19, 2014|publisher=''[[Forbes (magazine)|Forbes]]''|access-date=December 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became the ninth largest economy in the world, just behind [[Canada]]. Spain joined the industrialised world, leaving behind the poverty and endemic functional underdevelopment it had experienced following the Napoleonic wars, the loss of most of [[Spanish Empire|its imperium]] in the 1820s and the civil wars of the 19th century because of the dynastic dispute for the crown.

===Industrialization===
[[File:RentaEspPorMex.png|thumb|300px|right|Nominal GDP per capita of Spain, Portugal and México in the 20th century]]

[[Image:Monumento al Seat 600 . Fuengirola - España.jpg|right|thumb|A monument in Spain for the [[SEAT 600]], the car symbol of the Spanish miracle&lt;ref&gt;El coche como símbolo del declive http://www.abc.es/hemeroteca/historico-14-11-2008/abc/Opinion/el-coche-como-simbolo-del-declive_911233353595.html&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The rapid economic expansion reinvigorated old industrial areas: the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] and [[Ferrol, Spain|Ferrol]] northern coast (iron and steel, shipbuilding), in and around [[Barcelona]] (machinery, textiles, cars and petrochemicals) it also drove an enormous expansion in refining, petrochemicals, chemicals and engineering.  To help achieve rapid development, there was massive government investment through key state owned companies like the national industrial conglomerate [[Instituto Nacional de Industria]], the mass market car company [[SEAT]] in Barcelona and the shipbuilder [[Navantia|Empresa Nacional Bazán]]. With heavy protection from foreign competition within the domestic Spanish market, these companies led the [[industrialisation]] of the country, restoring the prosperity of industrial areas like Barcelona and [[Bilbao]] and creating new industrial areas, most notably around [[Madrid]]. Although there was economic liberalisation in the period, key enterprises remained under state control.

===Automotive industry===
The [[automotive industry]] was one of the most powerful ''locomotivos'' of the Spanish Miracle: from 1958 to 1972 it grew at a yearly compound rate of 21.7%; in 1946 there were 72,000 private cars in Spain, in 1966 there were over 1 million.&lt;ref&gt;J.L. García Ruiz, "Barreiros Diesel y el desarrolo de la automoción en España"  {{cite web|url= |title=ftp://ftp.funep.es/phe/hdt2003.pdf }}ftp://ftp.funep.es/phe/hdt2003.pdf{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt; This growth rate had no equal in the world.
The [[icon]] of the ''desarrollo'' was the [[SEAT 600]] car, produced by the Spanish company SEAT. More than 794,000 of them were made between 1957 and 1973, and if at the beginning of this period it was the first car for many Spanish working-class families, at its end it was the first ''second'' one for many more.

'''''The Roses of Eyam''''' is a [[historical]] [[drama]] by [[Don Taylor (English director and playwright)|Don Taylor]] about [[Great Plague of London|The Great Plague]] that swept Britain in 1665/66. It is  largely based on the events that happened in the 'Plague Village' of [[Eyam]] in Derbyshire, between September 1665 and December 1666.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/legacies/myths_legends/england/derby/article_5.shtml Historical background] BBC Local History - Derbyshire, Feb 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Published in 1970, The Roses of Eyam had its world premiere at The [[Northcott Theatre]] in Exeter, Devon on 23 September 1970.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.survivors-mad-dog.org.uk/MD_Eyam_Roses.html ‘The Roses of Eyam’] at Maddog. June 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Heinemann 1996 Intro"/&gt;

==Description==

The script requires a large cast, within which there must be a core of actors prepared to learn extensive parts and portray passionate and sustained emotion. The play best suits an atmospheric setting such as a  Norman church or [[English Restoration|Restoration]] [[Manor House]], where it can be performed in the [[Theatre in the round|round]].  Taylor himself filmed the story for television in 1973.&lt;ref name="imdb"&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0476366/ IMDB details] Information on the 1973 TV production.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roses of Eyam was originally intended for an adult audience but has become part of children's theatre. The play is now also a set text in many British schools for students of English Literature and Drama.&lt;ref name="Hunt"&gt;{{cite book|last1= Hunt|first1=Peter |last2=Sheila |first2=G|last3=Bannister |first3=Ray|title=InteInternational companion encyclopedia of children's literature  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=13jKoYZhTdgC&amp;pg=PA218&amp;dq=%E2%80%98The+Roses+of+Eyam%E2%80%99&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=_3wbTM-3M6qg4Qa-rfXICg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%E2%80%98The%20Roses%20of%20Eyam%E2%80%99&amp;f=false|year=1996 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=0-415-08856-9|page=218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==TV production==
A television production  of ''The Roses of Eyam'' was broadcast on BBC2 on 12 June 1973 and produced at the BBC's Pebble Mill Studios. Don Taylor himself adapted the stage play for television and he directed it.&lt;ref name="imdb"/&gt;

==Outline==
It begins as educated [[Anglican]] clergyman the [[Reverend William Mompesson]] receives the living from his benefactors, the Saville &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/eng/DBY/Eyam/WmMompesson.html Genealogical evidence of this] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930223501/http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/eng/DBY/Eyam/WmMompesson.html |date=2007-09-30 }} William Mompesson of Eyam (1639-1709) at Genealogy UK and Ireland. Rosemary Lockie , March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  family. A 'King's Man', he is replacing the previous [[Puritan]] incumbent, Thomas Stanley who has refused to comply with the [[Act of Uniformity 1662|1662 Act of Uniformity]] which makes use of the Anglican [[1662 Book of Common Prayer|Book of Common Prayer]] compulsory.&lt;ref name="Heinemann 1996 Intro"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Taylor|first1=Don |last2=Speakman|first2=Ray |title=The Roses of Eyam |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J6yRQfzsqhcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%E2%80%98The+Roses+of+Eyam%E2%80%99&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3oEbTMWUHIvu4gaRvNyYCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-thumbnail&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCsQ6wEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=1996 |publisher=Heinemann|isbn=0-435-23316-5|pages=Introduction }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early part of the play establishes that the village is still divided  between [[Cavalier|Royalist]] and [[Roundhead]] sympathisers. Meanwhile, local [[tailor]] George Vicars takes delivery of a large consignment of cloth from London. Within days the village is stricken by plague.

Families shut themselves away in their homes fearing that contact with others will invite the infection. With the onset of cold weather in autumn the number of cases falls but rises again when the warm weather comes in spring. An exodus of the village begins but Mompesson and Stanley  put aside their differences to persuade the villagers to stay put until the plague is over. The villagers are reminded that if they leave they will be welcome nowhere and will die as outcasts and vagrants, taking many other innocents with them. The villagers voluntarily decide to isolate themselves. Food is left for them by the county [[High Sheriff]] at stones marking the limits of the [[quarantine]]. As the play evolves the audience moves from location to location and the action intensifies as the village empties.

Some villagers build shacks in the hills, or live in caves, to be away from the infection. The deaths continue through the summer with hardly anyone left to bury the dead. Grass grows in the village streets. Both rectors have doubts at their actions but eventually the dying ceases and the survivors learn they have been successful with no other cases of plague occurring in the county.

Some humour is included by the mad orphan boy "Bedlam" who sings and dances through the worst times and the two cantankerous old yokels ''Unwin'' and ''Merril''.

In some productions each corpse reappears in ghostly white make-up until the audience is surrounded by keening wraiths.

Tiger Cub Economies are so named because they attempt to follow the same [[Export-oriented industrialization|export-driven]] model of [[technology]] and [[economic development]] already achieved by the rich [[high-tech]] [[industrialized]] [[developed country]] of [[South Korea]] and nation [[Taiwan]] along with the wealthy financial centers of [[Hong Kong]] and [[Singapore]], which are all collectively referred to as the [[Four Asian Tigers]].

'''Veralipride''' ('''Agreal''', '''Agradil''') is a benzamide neuroleptic medicine indicated in the treatment of vasomotor symptoms associated with the menopause. It was first authorised for use in 1979. Veralipride has never gained approval in the United States.

In September 2006, it was withdrawn from the Spanish market. As a result, the European Commission referred the matter to the [[European Medicines Agency]] (EMA).  On July 2007, the EMA recommended the withdrawal of marketing authorisations for veralipride.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emea.europa.eu/pdfs/human/referral/agreal/Veralipride-H-A-31-788-en.pdf   OVERALL SUMMARY OF THE SCIENTIFIC EVALUATION OF MEDICINAL PRODUCTS CONTAINING VERALIPRIDE (from the EMEA website)]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
