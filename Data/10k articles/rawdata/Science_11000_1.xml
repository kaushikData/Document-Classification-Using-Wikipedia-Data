'''4C +37.11''' or '''Galaxy 0402+379''' is a [[radio galaxy]] and [[elliptical galaxy]] featuring binary [[supermassive black hole]]s with the least separation of any directly observed binaries, as of 2006. The separation between the two is 24 [[light-years]] or 7.3 [[parsecs]], with an orbital period of 30,000 years.  The two supermassive black holes, about 750 million light years from earth, have a combined mass of about 15 billion {{Solar mass|link=y}}.&lt;ref name=Klesman&gt;{{cite web

Other supermassive binary black hole candidates suggest the smaller separation distances expected as they eventually merge, but have not been confirmed. For example, [[quasar]] [[OJ 287]] is inferred to have a binary supermassive black hole pair with an orbital period of 12 years, and thus be much closer together. However these have not been directly measured and additional observation, possibly over extended time periods, is needed.

The eventual collision of the pair, which should stay apart for at least a few million more years, would result in strong [[gravitational waves]].&lt;ref name=Klesman/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6200">[[Image:Adolf Busemann at Langley.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Adolf Busemann at Langley]]
'''Adolf Busemann''' (20 April 1901 – 3 November 1986) was a [[Germany|German]] [[aerospace engineering|aerospace engineer]] and influential [[Nazi]]-era pioneer in [[aerodynamics]], specialising in supersonic airflows. He introduced the concept of [[swept wing]]s, and after immigrating in  1947 to the [[United States]] (''see'' [[Operation Paperclip]]) invented the shockwave free [[Busemann's Biplane]].

Born in [[Lübeck]], [[German Empire|Germany]], Busemann attended the [[TU Braunschweig]], receiving his Ph.D. in engineering in 1924. The next year he was given the position of aeronautical research scientist at the [[Max-Planck Institute]] where he joined the famed team led by [[Ludwig Prandtl]], including [[Theodore von Kármán]], [[Max Munk]] and [[Jakob Ackeret]]. In 1930 he was promoted to professor at [[Georg-August University of Göttingen]]. He held various positions within the German scientific community during this period, and during the war he was the director of the [[Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt|Braunschweig Laboratory]], a famous research establishment.&lt;ref name=memorial&gt;[http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=1384&amp;page=64 Adolf Busemann, 1901-1986], memorial by Robert Jones&lt;/ref&gt;

Busemann discovered the benefits of the [[swept wing]] for aircraft at high speeds, presenting a paper on the topic at the [[Volta Conference]] in Rome in 1935. The paper concerned [[supersonic]] flow only. At the time of his proposal, flight much beyond 300 miles per hour had not been achieved and it was considered an academic curiosity. Nevertheless, he continued working with the concept, and by the end of the year had demonstrated similar benefits in the [[transonic]] region as well.&lt;ref name=memorial/&gt; As director of the Braunschweig labs, he started an experimental [[wind tunnel]] test series of the concept, and by 1942 had amassed a considerable amount of useful technical data. As the need for higher speed aircraft became pressing in Germany, the [[Messerschmitt Me P.1101]] was developed to flight test these designs.

When [[World War II]] ended, a team of American aerodynamists travelled to Germany as part of [[Operation Lusty]]. The team included von Kármán, [[Tsien Hsue-shen]], [[Hugh Dryden]] and [[George S. Schairer]] from [[Boeing]]. They reached the Braunschweig labs on 7 May, where they found a mass of data on the swept wing concept. When they asked Busemann about it, "his face lit up" and he said, "Oh, you remember, I read a paper on it at the Volta Conference in 1935".&lt;ref name=memorial/&gt; Several members of the team did remember the presentation, but had completely forgotten the details in terms of what the presentation was actually about.&lt;ref name=memorial/&gt; Realizing its importance, Schairer immediately wrote to Boeing and told them to investigate the concept, leading to a re-modeling of the [[B-47 Stratojet]] with a swept wing. Busemann's work, along with similar work by [[Robert Thomas Jones (engineer)|Robert T. Jones]] in the US, led to a revolution in aircraft design.

Near the end of the war, Busemann started studies of airflow around [[delta wing]]s, leading to the development of his supersonic conical flow theory. This reduced the complexity of the airflow to a [[conformal mapping]] in the complex plane, and was used for some time in the industry.{{cn|date=April 2016|reason=His work on both the conical flow and its modelling as a conformal mapping need citing.}}

Busemann moved to the United States in 1947 and started work at [[NACA]]'s [[Langley Research Center]]. In 1951 he gave a talk where he described the fact that air at near supersonic speeds no longer varied in diameter with speed according to [[Bernoulli's theorem]] but remained largely incompressible and acting as fixed diameter pipes, or as he put it, 'streampipes'. He jokingly referred to aerodynamicists as needing to become 'pipe fitters'. This talk lead an attendee, [[Richard Whitcomb]], to try and work out what these pipes were doing in a transonic test he was performing, inventing the [[Whitcomb area rule]] a few days later.&lt;ref&gt;[https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4219/Chapter5.html The Whitcomb Area Rule: NACA Aerodynamics Research and Innovation]&lt;/ref&gt;

At Langley, he worked primarily on the problems of [[sonic boom]]s, and spent a considerable amount of effort looking at ways to characterize them, and potentially eliminate them. He later invented Busemann's Biplane, a supersonic design he originally proposed in 1936 that emits no [[shock wave]]s and has no [[wave drag]], at the cost of having no lift.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|magazine=Air and Space Magazine|title= The Enduring Biplane: It Just Won't Quit|author=Wilkinson, Stephan|date=April 1986|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; Busemann also did early work on [[magneto-hydrodynamics]] in the 1920s, as well as on cylindrical focusing of shock waves and non-steady gas dynamics.

Busemann held a professorship at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]] from 1963 and suggested the use of ceramic tiles on the [[space shuttle]], which were adopted by NASA.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/05/obituaries/adolf-busemann-85-dead-designer-of-the-swept-wing.html Adolf Busemann, 85, Dead; Designer of the Swept Wing]&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded the [[Ludwig-Prandtl-Ring]] from the [[Deutsche Gesellschaft für Luft- und Raumfahrt]] (German Society for Aeronautics and Astronautics) for "outstanding contribution in the field of aerospace engineering" in 1966. He died at age 85 in [[Boulder, Colorado]].

'''''Aqueous Wastes from Petroleum and Petrochemical Plants''''' is a book about the composition and treatment of the various [[wastewater]] streams produced in the [[hydrocarbon]] processing industries (i.e., [[oil refinery|oil refineries]], [[petrochemical plant]]s and [[natural gas processing]] plants). When it was published in 1967, it was the first book devoted to that subject.

The book is notable for being the first technical publication of a method for the rigorous tray-by-tray design of [[steam distillation|steam distillation towers]] for removing [[hydrogen sulfide]] from oil refinery wastewaters. Such towers are commonly referred to as sour water strippers. The design method was also presented at a World Petroleum Congress Meeting shortly after the book was published.&lt;ref name=Beychok&gt;Beychok, M.R., ''The Design of Sour Water Strippers'', Individual Paper 61, Proceedings of Seventh World Petroleum Congress, Mexico City, April 1967&lt;/ref&gt;

The subjects covered in the book include wastewater [[pollutants]] and the pertinent governmental regulations, oil refinery and petrochemical plant wastewater [[effluent]]s, treatment methods, miscellaneous effluents, data on the cost of various wastewater treatment methods, and an extensive reference list.

==Availability in libraries==

The book became a classic in its field and is available in major university, public and industrial libraries worldwide. The book has no ISBN because they were not in use in 1967. The [[Library of Congress]] catalog number (LCCN) is 67019834 and the [[British Library]] system number is 012759691. It is no longer in print, but photocopies can be obtained from the ProQuest Company's  ''Books On Demand'' service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wwwlib.umi.com/bod/basic Books On Demand search page]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Book reviews==

One of the book reviews is that of Dr. Nelson V. Nemerow, a Civil Engineering professor at the [[University of Syracuse]] in New York state, published in 1968 in the [[American Chemical Society]]'s journal ''Environmental Science and Technology''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pubs.acs.org/cgi-bin/abstract.cgi/esthag/1968/2/i04/f-pdf/f_es60016a604.pdf?sessid=6006l3 BOOKSHELF:''Compleat aqueous waste control guide'']&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--[[Image:Pluto discovery plates.png|thumb|250px|An astrograph captured the photographic plates used to discover [[Pluto]].]]--&gt;
An '''astrograph''' ('''astrographic camera''') is a telescope designed for the sole purpose of [[astrophotography]]. Astrographs are mostly used in wide field [[astronomical survey]]s of the sky and for detection of objects such as [[asteroids]], [[meteor]]s, and [[comet]]s.

==Design==
Most research telescopes in this class are [[Refracting telescope|refractors]], although there are many (usually larger) [[Reflecting telescope|reflecting]] designs such as the [[Ritchey-Chrétien telescope|Ritchey-Chrétien]] and [[catadioptric]]s such as the [[Schmidt camera]]. The main parameters of an Astrograph are the diameter and [[Focal ratio|f-ratio]] of the [[objective (optics)|objective]], which determine the [[field of view]] and image scale on the photographic plate or [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] detector. The objective of an astrograph is usually not very large, on the order of {{convert|20|to|50|cm|abbr=on|0}}.

The shape of the focal plane is often designed to work in conjunction with a specific shaped photographic plate or CCD detector. The objective is designed to produce a particularly large (for example, {{convert|17|x|17|in}}), flat, and distortion-less image at the [[focal plane]]. They may even be designed to focus certain wavelengths of light to match the type of film they are designed to use (early astrographs were corrected to work in blue wavelengths to match photographic emulsions of the time).
 
Wide-angle astrographs with short f-ratios are used for photographing a huge area of sky. Astrographs with higher f-ratios are used in more precise measurements. Many observatories of the world are equipped with the so-called '''normal astrographs''' with an aperture of around {{convert|13|in}} and a focal length of {{convert|11|ft}}. The purpose of a "normal astrograph" is to create images where the scale of the image at the focal plane is a standard of approximately 60 [[Arc minute|arcsecs]]/mm.

==Applications==

===Astrometry===
Astrographs used in [[astrometry]] record images that are then used to "map" the positions of objects over a large area of the sky. These maps are then published in catalogs to be used in further study or to serve as reference points for deep-space imaging.

===Stellar classification===
Astrographs used for [[stellar classification]] sometimes consist of two identical telescopes on the same mount (a double astrograph). Each sky field can be simultaneously photographed in two colors (usually blue and yellow). Each telescope may have individually designed [[non-achromatic objective]]s to focus the desired wavelength of light which is paired with the respective color-sensitive (black-and-white) photographic plate. In other cases a single telescope is used to make two exposures of the same part of the sky with different filters and color sensitive film used on each exposure. Two-color photography lets astronomers measure the color, as well as the brightness (magnitude), of each star imaged. Colors tell the star's "temperature”. Knowing the color type and magnitudes lets astronomers determine the distance of a star. Sky fields that are photographed twice, decades apart in time, will reveal a nearby star's [[proper motion]] when measured against the background of distant stars or galaxies.

===Discovery of astronomical objects===
By taking two exposures of the same section of the sky days or weeks apart, it is possible to find objects such as [[asteroids]], [[meteor]]s, [[comet]]s, [[variable star]]s, [[nova]]e, and even unknown [[planet]]s. By comparing the pair of images, using a device such as a [[blink comparator]], astronomers are able to find objects that moved or changed brightness between the two exposures or simply appear in one image only, as in the case of a nova or meteor. Sometimes objects can even be found in one exposure since a fast moving object will appear as a "line" in a long exposure.

One well-known case of an astrograph used in a discovery is [[Clyde Tombaugh]]’s discovery of the [[dwarf planet]] [[Pluto]] in 1930. Tombaugh was given the job of hunting for a suspected "9th planet" to be achieved by systematically photographing the area of the sky around the [[ecliptic]]. Tombaugh used [[Lowell Observatory]]'s {{convert|13|in|sing=on}} (3 lens element), f/5.3 refractor astrograph, which recorded images on {{convert|14|x|17|in|sing=on}} glass plates.

== Use in amateur astrophotography ==

In the [[amateur astronomy]] field there are many types of commercial and [[Amateur telescope making|amateur built]] telescopes designed for [[astrophotography]] labeled "astrographs". Optical designs of amateur astrographs vary widely but include [[apochromatic]] [[Refracting telescope|refractors]], variations of Cassegrain reflectors including [[Ritchey-Chretien]] and [[Dall-Kirkham]] designs, or [[Newtonian reflector]]s. Most optical designs do not produce large, flat, and well-corrected imaging fields and therefore require some type of optical correction by way of [[Field flattener lens|field flatteners]] or [[Coma (optics)|coma]] correctors. Amateur astrographs typically have purpose-built focusers, are constructed of thermally stable materials like carbon fiber and are paired with heavy duty mounts to facilitate accurate tracking of deep sky objects for long periods of time.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

'''[[Jonkheer]] Bernard Amé Léonard du Bus de Gisignies''' (June 21, 1808 in [[Sint-Joost-ten-Node]] &amp;ndash; July 6, 1874 in [[Bad Ems]]) was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[nobleman]] and later on a [[Belgium|Belgian]] politician, [[ornithologist]] and [[paleontologist]]. He was the second son of [[Leonard Pierre Joseph du Bus de Gisignies]]. He married ''Petronilla Truyts'' on 19 May 1845, together they had two children; Viscount Bernard Daniel ([[Sint-Joost-ten-Node]], 7 October 1832-[[Brussels]], 17 February 1917) and Viscount Chretien ([[Sint-Joost-ten-Node]], 4 November 1845-[[Jabbeke]], 3 July 1883).

He studied law at the [[State University of Louvain]], but soon became more interested in [[ornithology]]. In 1835 he presented a manuscript to the [[The Royal Academies for Science and the Arts of Belgium|Royal Academy of Belgium]] in which described the bird ''[[Leptorhynchus pectoralis]]''. He was a member of parliament for [[Soignies]].

He became the first director of the [[Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences]] in 1846. On this occasion he donated 2474 birds from his own collection to the museum. In 1860, during the construction of new fortifications around [[Antwerp]] he became involved in [[paleontology]]. The [[fossils]] found were mainly from [[whales]]. He also obtained the skeletons from a [[bowhead whale]] (''Balaena mysticetus'') and a young [[Blue Whale]] (''Balaenoptera musculus''), which are still on display in the museum. In 1860 the skeleton of a [[Lier mammoth|mammoth]] was found near [[Lier, Belgium|Lier]] and was brought to the museum (on display since 1869). At that time the only other skeleton of a mammoth was on display in the museum of [[Saint Petersburg]] (Russia).

In 1867 he became the director of the ''science section'' of the [[The Royal Academies for Science and the Arts of Belgium|Royal Academy of Belgium]].

The '''''CO''met ''N''ucleus ''TOUR''''' ('''CONTOUR''') was a [[NASA]] [[Discovery Program|Discovery-class]] [[space probe]] that failed shortly after its July 2002 launch. It had as its primary objective close flybys of two [[comet]] nuclei with the possibility of a flyby of a third known comet or an as-yet-undiscovered comet.

The two comets scheduled to be visited were [[Comet Encke|Encke]] and [[Schwassmann-Wachmann-3]], and the third target was [[6P/d'Arrest|d'Arrest]]. It was hoped that a new comet would have been discovered in the [[inner Solar System]] between 2006 and 2008, in which case the spacecraft trajectory would have been changed if possible to rendezvous with the new comet. Scientific objectives included imaging the nuclei at resolutions of up to {{convert|4|m|ft|sp=us}}, performing spectral mapping of the nuclei at resolutions of up to {{convert|100|m|ft|sp=us}}, and obtaining detailed [[compositional data]] on gas and dust in the near-nucleus environment, with the goal of improving knowledge of the characteristics of comet nuclei.

After the [[solid rocket motor]] intended to inject the spacecraft into [[solar orbit]] was ignited on August 15, 2002, contact with the probe could not be re-established. Ground-based telescopes later found three objects along the course of the satellite, leading to the speculation that it had disintegrated. Attempts to contact the probe were ended on December 20, 2002. The probe thus accomplished none of its primary scientific objectives, but did prove some spaceflight technologies, such as the APL-developed non-coherent spacecraft navigation technique, which was later used on the [[New Horizons]] spacecraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=DeBoy |first=C.C. |last2=Haskins |first2=C.B. |last3=Brown |first3=T.A. |last4=Schulze |first4=R.C. |last5=Bernacik |first5=M.A. |last6=Jensen |first6=J.R. |last7=Millard |first7=W. |last8=Duven |first8=D. |last9=Hill |first9=S. |title=The RF telecommunications system for the New Horizons mission to Pluto |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1367922/ |pages=11 |journal=2004 IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings (IEEE Cat.

==Spacecraft==
[[File:CONTOUR pre-launch.jpg|thumb|right|The ''CONTOUR'' spacecraft at the [[Kennedy Space Center]] in May 2002, being prepared for launch.]]

===Design and construction===
The ''CONTOUR'' spacecraft was constructed in-house at the [[Johns Hopkins University]] [[Applied Physics Laboratory]]. ''CONTOUR'' was shaped as an [[octagonal prism]], measuring at {{convert|2.1|m|ft}} tall and {{convert|1.8|m|ft}} long, had a total fueled mass of {{convert|398|kg|lb|abbr=on}} at launch, not including the {{convert|377|kg|lb|abbr=on}} mass of the STAR 30 [[Booster (rocketry)|booster]] it was attached to, during the launch phase of the mission.&lt;ref name="nsscd"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Williams.|first1=David R.|title=CONTOUR (NSSDC/COSPAR ID: 2002-034A)|url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=2002-034A|website=[[National Space Science Data Center]]|publisher=[[Goddard Space Flight Center]] / [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)]]|date=2002|accessdate=23 January 2016|ref=nssdc}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spacecraft was fitted with a {{convert|25|cm|in|abbr=on}} [[whipple shield]], similar to the one used on ''[[Stardust (spacecraft)|Stardust]]'', on its leading face, designed with four layers of nextel fabric and seven layers of [[kevlar]].&lt;ref name="sfn-spacecraft"&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Applied Physics Laboratory]]|title=The CONTOUR spacecraft|url=https://spaceflightnow.com/delta/d292/020628contour.html|website=Spaceflight Now|date=28 June 2002|accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=paolo-david&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ulivi|first1=Paolo|last2=Harland|first2=David|title=Robotic Exploration of the Solar System: Part 3: Wows and Woes, 1997-2003|date=14 August 2012|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media]]|isbn=9780387096278|pages=250–254|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=Ndjt1DkCFvoC&amp;|accessdate=23 January 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shield was built to allow the spacecraft to withstand the respective 28.2 and 14&amp;nbsp;km/s velocity flybys of comets Encke and Schwassmann-Wachmann-3, where the spacecraft would be subjected to numerous particles ejecting from the [[comet nucleus|nuclei]] of the comets.&lt;ref name=asce-dustshield&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Osegueda|first1=R.|last2=Carrasco|first2=C.|last3=Orozco|first3=M.|last4=Eftis|first4=J.|last5=Reynolds|first5=E.|last6=Sholar|first6=T.|title=CONTOUR Dust Shield Performance|journal=[[Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part G: Journal of Aerospace Engineering|Journal of Aerospace Engineering]]|date=1 October 2001|volume=14|issue=4|pages=147–157|doi=10.1061/(ASCE)0893-1321(2001)14:4(147)|url=http://ascelibrary.org/doi/10.1061/%28ASCE%290893-1321%282001%2914%3A4%28147%29|accessdate=23 January 2016|issn=0893-1321}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although mission scientists predicted that the spacecraft would take no significant damage during the Encke and Schwassmann-Wachmann-3 encounters, the shield and its [[prototype]]s were tested vigorously during the construction of the spacecraft, including one where a shield prototype was shot at with surrogate [[nylon]] particles. The results of the earlier tests allowed mission planners to determine a safe distance from which the ''CONTOUR'' would pass by comets targeted on the mission.&lt;ref name=asce-dustshield/&gt; Three of the four [[scientific instrument]]s aboard the spacecraft are embedded within this heat shield.&lt;ref name="sfn-spacecraft"/&gt;

===Spacecraft subsystems===

====Power====
Power for ''CONTOUR'' derives from [[solar cell]]s, which are mounted onto the spacecraft, decorating the sides and rear and generating up to 670 [[watt]]s of power. A [[nickel–cadmium battery]] designed to last up to nine [[ampere-hour]]s was also installed aboard the spacecraft in the event that the solar cell system fails, or does not provide enough power for the spacecraft or its instruments to function.&lt;ref name="sfn-spacecraft"/&gt;

====Communications and data====

====Propulsion and guidance====

===Scientific payload===
* '''CIDA'''
:The Comet Impact Dust Analyzer (CIDA)

* '''CRISP'''
:The CONTOUR Remote Imager/Spectrograph (CRISP)

* '''CAI'''
:The CONTOUR Aft Imager (CAI), also known as the CONTOUR Forward Imager (CFI)

* '''NGIMS'''
:Neutral Gas Ion Mass Spectrometer (NGIMS)

==Mission==
[[File:CONTOUR Launch (19083178100).jpg|thumb|left|Long-exposure photograph of the launch of ''CONTOUR'' from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station|Cape Canaveral]] on July 3, 2002.]]
CONTOUR launched on a Delta 7425 (a [[Delta II rocket|Delta II]] Lite launch vehicle with four strap-on solid-rocket boosters and a Star 27 third stage) on July 3, 2002, at 6:47:41 UT (2:47:41&amp;nbsp;a.m. EDT) from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]]. It was launched into a high-[[apogee]] Earth orbit with a period of 5.5 days. Following a series of phasing orbits, the Star 30 solid rocket motor was used to perform an injection maneuver on August 15, 2002, to put CONTOUR in the proper trajectory for an Earth flyby in August 2003 followed by an encounter with comet Encke on November 12, 2003, at a distance of 100 to 160&amp;nbsp;km and a flyby speed of 28.2&amp;nbsp;km/s, 1.07 AU from the Sun and 0.27 AU from Earth. During the August 2002 injection maneuver, the probe was lost.

Three more Earth flybys would have followed, in August 2004, February 2005, and February 2006. On June 18, 2006, CONTOUR would have encountered comet Schwassmann-Wachmann-3 at 14&amp;nbsp;km/s, 0.95 AU from the Sun and 0.33 AU from Earth. Two more Earth flybys were scheduled in February 2007 and 2008, and a flyby of comet d'Arrest might have occurred on 16 August 2008 at a relative velocity of 11.8&amp;nbsp;km/s, 1.35 AU from the Sun and 0.36 AU from Earth. All flybys would have had a closest encounter distance of about 100&amp;nbsp;km and would have occurred near the period of maximum activity for each comet. After the comet Encke encounter, CONTOUR might have been retargeted towards a new comet if one was discovered with the desired characteristics (e.g. active, brighter than [[absolute magnitude]] 10, perihelion within 1.5 AU).

==Investigation into failure==
According to NASA: "An investigation board concluded that the most likely cause of the mishap was structural failure of the spacecraft due to plume heating during the solid-rocket motor burn. Alternate possible but less likely causes determined were catastrophic failure of the solid rocket motor, collision with space debris, and loss of dynamic control of the spacecraft."&lt;ref&gt;[http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/profile.cfm?MCode=CONTOUR&amp;Display=ReadMore CONTOUR] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080924061924/http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/profile.cfm?MCode=CONTOUR&amp;Display=ReadMore# |date=2008-09-24 }} at NASA.gov.

==Proposed reflight==
After the loss of CONTOUR, a replacement spacecraft &amp;ndash; CONTOUR 2 &amp;ndash; was proposed, scheduled for launch in 2006. However, the replacement did not ultimately materialize.

The '''Chronic Effects of Neurotrauma Consortium''' or '''CENC''' is a federally funded research project devised to address the long-term effects of mild [[traumatic brain injury]] in [[Military personnel|military service personnel]] (SMs) and [[Veterans]]. Announced by [[Barack Obama|President Barack Obama]] on August 20, 2013, the CENC was one of two major initiatives developed in response to the injuries incurred by U.S. service personnel during [[Operation Enduring Freedom]] and [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Obama Introduces New PTSD and Education Programs|publisher=[[Military.com]]|url=http://www.military.com/daily-news/2013/08/12/obama-introduces-new-ptsd-and-education-programs.html|accessdate=2 May 2014|date=12 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Obama administration to research TBI, PTSD in new efforts Read more: Chronic Effects of Neurotrauma Consortium - FierceGovernment |publisher=Fiercegovernment.com |url=http://www.fiercegovernment.com/story/obama-administration-research-tbi-ptsd-new-efforts/2013-08-14 |accessdate=2 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502230312/http://www.fiercegovernment.com/story/obama-administration-research-tbi-ptsd-new-efforts/2013-08-14 |archivedate=2 May 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=DoD, VA Establish Two Multi-Institutional Consortia to Research PTSD and TBI| publisher=[[United States Department of Veterans Affairs]]| url=http://www.va.gov/opa/pressrel/pressrelease.cfm?id=2473|accessdate=2 May 2014|date=10 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project is jointly funded in the amount of $62.175 million by the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] (DoD) and the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]] (VA).

==Background==


In short, critical gaps exist in the literature, with a paucity of prospective, controlled studies on late-life outcomes and [[neurodegeneration]] after [[Mild TBI|mTBI]] and related basic science research. These research gaps are particularly prominent in the injuries and difficulties seen in combat-exposed populations. The existing research, although suggestive, is not rigorous or robust enough to allow for a clear understanding of the relationships, risks, and potential effective interventions for mTBI, chronic symptoms, and neurodegeneration. To date, no controlled prospective longitudinal study has examined the late-life cognitive, behavioral, systemic, and functional effects of TBI of any severity. Given the absence of prospective studies, the association between TBI and early neurodegeneration is merely theoretical, and the actual risk factors and rate/extent of physiologic and clinical decline over time are unknown. It is also unclear whether a single TBI may be enough to begin a degenerative cascade in select individuals or whether a critical number (dose threshold) of TBIs is needed to “prime” the central nervous system for degeneration. As the majority of TBIs in the military are mild, prospective studies of cognitive outcomes from mild injury are necessary to determine the long-term risks posed to SMs and Veterans. The potential link between mTBI and the development of early dementia is a significant concern for not only at-risk SMs, Veterans, and their families, but also for DoD and VA resource planning, given the high service utilization in the DoD and VA health systems associated with dementia.&lt;ref&gt;Taber KH, Warden DL, Hurley RA: Blast-Related Traumatic Brain Injury: What Is Known? J Neuropsychiatr Clin Neurosci 2006;18:141-145&lt;/ref&gt;

Given these gaps in scientific research and knowledge, the military- and Veteran-specific issues involved, and the importance of a uniform approach to this critical set of problems, the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs jointly issued a request for proposals to fund a 5-year, $62.175 million project to address these concerns. After a competitive application process, a consortium led by [[Virginia Commonwealth University]] prevailed and was announced as the recipient of the award by President Obama on August 20, 2013.&lt;ref name="WhiteHouse10Aug2013FactSheet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VCU_VCUWillLead62Million"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VCU_LargestFederalGrantInVCUsHistory"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RTD_VCUToLeadMajorStudyOfConcussions"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ArmyTech_BrainTrust-TheUSConsortiaTacking"/&gt;&lt;ref name="USArmy_DODPartnersToCombatBrainInjury"/&gt;  At the time of the award, this was the single largest grant ever awarded to Virginia Commonwealth University.&lt;ref name="VCU_LargestFederalGrantInVCUsHistory"/&gt;

==The Consortium==

The mission of the CENC is to fill the gaps in knowledge about the basic science of [[mild TBI]] (also termed [[concussion]]), to determine its effects on late-life outcomes and [[neurodegeneration]], to identify service members most susceptible to these effects, and to identify the most effective treatment strategies.&lt;ref name="WhiteHouse10Aug2013FactSheet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VCU_VCUWillLead62Million"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VCU_LargestFederalGrantInVCUsHistory"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CENC_GoalsAndMissions"&gt;{{cite web | title=Goals and Mission | publisher=Chronic Effects of Neurotrauma Consortium| url=https://cenc.rti.org/Goals-and-Mission|accessdate=2 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CENC is a multi-center collaboration linking premiere basic science, translational, and clinical neuroscience researchers from the DoD, VA, academic universities, and private research institutes to effectively address the scientific, diagnostic, and therapeutic ramifications of mild TBI and its long-term effects.&lt;ref name="VCU_LargestFederalGrantInVCUsHistory"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ArmyTech_RTIToResearchMildTraumaticBrainInjury"/&gt;&lt;ref name="USArmy_DODPartnersToCombatBrainInjury"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RTD_VCUToLeadMajorStudyOfConcussions"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ArmyTech_BrainTrust-TheUSConsortiaTacking"/&gt;

===Oversight===
The CENC has oversight from a Government Steering Committee (GSC). Members of the GSC are DoD/VA appointed and is composed of both government representatives and non-government subject matter experts. The GSC approves all studies to be conducted, recommends new studies, and identifies existing and new requirements as they arise. The GSC is the overall main governing and management committee for the project and the committee through which the DoD and VA interact and collaborate with the CENC. The GSC determines all major scientific decisions, and clinical studies proposed by the Consortium Committee proceed into the implementation stage only with the approval of the GSC. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Government Steering Committee | publisher=Chronic Effects of Neurotrauma Consortium| url=https://cenc.rti.org/Consortium-Members/Government-Steering-Committee|accessdate=2 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=FY12 Chronic Effects of Neurotrauma Consortium (CENC) Government Steering Committee | publisher=Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs| url=http://cdmrp.army.mil/phtbi/panels/panels12_cenc.shtml|accessdate=2 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Comfort zone.jpg|thumb|The three psychological states.]]
A '''comfort zone''' is a [[Mental status examination|psychological state]] in which things feel familiar to a person and they are at ease and in control of their environment, experiencing low levels of [[anxiety]] and [[stress (psychological)|stress]]. In this zone, a steady level of performance is possible.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alasdair A. K. White]] "From Comfort Zone to Performance Management" [http://www.whiteandmaclean.eu/from-comfort-zone-to-performance-management/]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bardwick defines the term as "a behavioral state where a person operates in an anxiety-neutral position."&lt;ref name="Bardwick1995"&gt;{{cite book|first=Judith M. |last=Bardwick|title=Danger in the Comfort Zone: From Boardroom to Mailroom--how to Break the Entitlement Habit That's Killing American Business|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=rrJ_Ohzzm7oC}}|year=1995|publisher=AMACOM Div American Mgmt Assn|isbn=978-0-8144-7886-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brené Brown|Brown]] describes it as "Where our uncertainty, scarcity and vulnerability are minimized—where we believe we'll have access to enough love, food, talent, time, admiration. Where we feel we have some control."&lt;ref name="NYT 2011"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tugend|first1=Alina| title=Tiptoeing Out of One’s Comfort Zone (and of Course, Back In)|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/12/your-money/12shortcuts.html|accessdate=11 December 2014|date=11 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performance management==

Stepping out of a comfort zone raises anxiety and generates a stress response.  This results in an enhanced level of concentration and focus. 

White (2009) refers to the "optimal performance zone", in which performance can be enhanced by some amount of stress.&lt;ref name="White2009"&gt;{{cite book|first=Alasdair |last=White|title=From Comfort Zone to Performance Management: Understanding Development and Performance|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=H4R3MAEACAAJ}}|date=1 December 2009|publisher=White &amp; MacLean Publishing|isbn=978-2-930583-01-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Yerkes|Yerkes]] (1907) who reported, "Anxiety improves performance until a certain optimum level of arousal has been reached. Beyond that point, performance deteriorates as higher levels of anxiety are attained."&lt;ref&gt;Yerkes, R &amp; Dodson, J. - "The Dancing Mouse, A Study in Animal Behavior" 1907 "Journal of Comparative Neurology &amp; Psychology", Number 18, pp 459–482&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond the optimum performance zone, lies the "danger zone" in which performance declines rapidly under the influence of greater anxiety.

However, stress in general can have an adverse effect on decision making: Fewer alternatives are tried out&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Staal, Mark A. [https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=20060017835 "Stress, cognition, and human performance: A literature review and conceptual framework."] (2004), NASA/TM-2004-212824, IH-054&lt;/ref&gt; and more familiar strategies are used, even if they are not helpful anymore.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Optimal [[performance management]] requires maximizing time in the optimum performance zone.

In [[bioinformatics]], a '''DNA read error''' occurs when a  [[sequence assembly|sequence assembler]] changes one DNA base for a different base. The reads from the sequence assembler is then used to create a [[de Bruijn graph]] which is used in various ways to find the read errors.

== Overview ==

 {{multiple image
 | direction = vertical
 | width = 250
 | footer = A sample DNA sequence and its respective de Bruijn Graph
 | image1 = SEQUENCE 1.png
 | caption1 = sequence 1
 | image2 = Simple de Bruijn Graph.png
 | caption2 = figure 1
 }}

From the way a de Bruijn graph is formed, we can see that there is a possibility of 4^k different nodes to make arrangements of a genome. The number of nodes used to create the graph can be reduced in number by considering only the k-mers found within the DNA strand of interest.  Given sequence 1, we can determine the nodes of size 7, or 7-mers, that will be in the graph. These 7-mers then create the graph shown in figure 1.

The graph shown in figure 1 is a very simple version of what a graph could look like...&lt;ref name=Homolog&gt;
     ''De Bruijn Graph of a small sequence''. (2011). Retrieved Feb 7, 2015, from Homolog.us — Bioinformatics: http://www.homolog.us/Tutorials/index.php?p=2.1&amp;s=1&lt;/ref&gt; This graph is formed by taking the last 6 elements of the 7-mer and linking it to the node whose first 6 elements are the same. Figure 1 is the most simplistic a de Bruijn graph can be, since each node has exactly one path into it and one path out. Most of the time, you will most likely see a graph where there is more than one edge directed to a node and/or more than one edge leaving a node. This happens due to the way nodes are connected. The nodes are connected by edges pointing to nodes if, and only if, the last ''k-1'' elements of the ''k''-mer you are looking at matches the first ''k-1'' elements of any node. This allows for a multiple-edged de Bruijn graph to form. These more complicated graphs happen due to either read errors or variations in DNA strands. Both causes make it difficult to determine the correct structure of the DNA, and what is causing the differences. Since most DNA strands will likely include read errors and variations, scientists hope to use an assembly process that can merge nodes of the graph when they are unambiguously connected after the graph has been cleaned of vertices and edges created by the errors.&lt;ref name=Simpson&gt;

== Tips and Bubbles ==

When a graph is formed from sequenced data, the read errors form tips and bubbles. A '''tip''' is where an error occurred during the sequencing process and has caused the graph to end prematurely and includes both correct and incorrect ''k''-mers. A '''bubble''' is also formed when an error occurs during the sequence reading process; however, wherever the error happens, there is a path for the ''k''-mer reads to reconnect with the main graph and continue as though nothing had ever happened. When there are tips and bubbles present in a de Bruijn graph formed from the data, they may be removed only if an error is what caused the tip or bubble to appear. When scientists are using a [[reference genome]], they can quickly and easily tell where tips are located by comparing the graph of the reference genome and the graph of the sequence. If there is not a reference genome, these tips are eliminated by tracing the branches backward until a point of ambiguity is found. These tips are then removed only if the branch containing the tip is shorter than a set threshold length.&lt;ref name=Simpson /&gt; The process of removing bubbles is slightly more complicated. The first thing that needs done is to identify the beginning of the bubble. From there, each path from the beginning of the bubble is followed until the point of reconnection. The point of reconnection can be different for each path. Since there can be paths of various lengths from the beginning node, the path which has a lower coverage is removed.&lt;ref name=Simpson /&gt;

=== Example ===

[[File:Sequence.png|thumb|300px|sequence 2]]

Given a sequence of any length, the first step that needs done is to enter the sequence into a sequencing program, have it sequenced, and return base pair (bp) reads of a certain length. Since there is not a sequencing program that is completely accurate, there will always be some reads which contain errors.  The most common sequencing method is the [[shotgun method]], which is the method most probably used on sequence 2. Once a method is decided on, you have to specify the length of the bp reads you would like it to return. In the case of sequence 2, it returned 7-bp reads with all errors made during the process noted in red.&lt;ref name=Flicek&gt;Flicek, P., &amp; Birney, E. (2009). Sense from sequence reads: methods for alignment and assembly. ''Nature methods, 6'', S6-S12. Figure 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the reads are obtained, they are hashed into ''k''-mers. The ''k''-mers then are recorded in a table with how many times each ''k''-mer appeared in the reads. For this example, each read was hashed into ''4''-mers and if there was an error it was recorded in red. All of the ''4''-mers were then recorded, with their frequency in the following table.

|}

Each individual cell of the table will then form a node, allowing a de Bruijn graph to be formed from the given ''k''-mers. In figure 2, linear stretches are identified and then another graph, figure 3, is formed where the linear stretches have become a single node, of a different ''k''-mer size, allowing for a more concise graph. In this simplified graph, it is easy to identify various tips and bubbles, as shown in figure 4. These bubbles and tips can then be removed, since we can identify that they were formed from errors in the bp reads, giving us a graph structure that should accurately and completely reflect the original sequence.&lt;ref name=Flicek /&gt; If you follow the de Bruijn graph shown in figure 5, you will see that the sequence formed does indeed match the DNA sequence given in sequence 2.

== Comparing Two DNA Strands ==

When comparing two strands of DNA, colored de Bruijn graphs are frequently used to identify errors. These errors, often [[polymorphism (biology)#Genetics|polymorphism]]s, cause bubbles, similar to the ones mentioned above, to form. Currently there are four main algorithms used to generalize the data and locate bubbles. The four algorithms extend de Bruijn graphs by allowing the nodes and edges in the graph to be colored by the samples from which they were observed&lt;ref name=Iqbal&gt;Iqbal, Z., Caccamo, M., Turner, I., Flicek, P., &amp; McVean, G. (2012). De novo assembly and genotyping of variants using colored de Bruijn graphs. ''Nature genetics, 44''(2), 226-232&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bubble Calling ===

The simplest use of a colored de Bruijn graph is known as the bubble calling algorithm. This algorithm looks, and locates, bubbles on the genome that differ from the original. These bubbles must be “clean”, or simply a divergence from the reference genome, but cannot be caused by deletions of DNA bases. This algorithm can have high false positive rates since there is a difficulty of separating repeat- and variant-induced bubbles; however, there is often a reference genome to help improve reliability. The reference genome also helps in the detection of variants and is essential to detect variant sites.&lt;ref name=Iqbal /&gt; Recently, scientists have discovered a way to use the bubble calling algorithm with [[copy number variation]] detection to allow for an opportunity of unbiased detection of these variations in the future&lt;ref name=Nijkamp&gt;Nijkamp, J. F., van den Broek, M. A., Geertman, J. M. A., Reinders, M. J., Daran, J. M. G., &amp; de Ridder, D. (2012). De novo detection of copy number variation by co-assembly. ''Bioinformatics, 28''(24), 3195-3202&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Path Divergence ===

When looking at complex variants, there is a very low chance that they will make a clean [[contig]]. Since this is the case most often, the path divergence algorithm is useful, especially when considering where deletions occur and the variant is so complex it is constrained to the reference allele. When there is a bubble formed, the path divergence algorithm is used the most frequently and allows detected bubbles to get deleted in a very systematic procedure. The algorithm first locates each point of divergence. Then from each point of divergence, the strands that form the bubble are traced to find where the two paths join after ''n'' nodes. If the two paths join, then the path with a lower coverage is removed and stored in a file.&lt;ref name=Simpson /&gt;

=== Multiple Sample Analysis ===

Using multiple samples substantially improves the power and false discovery rate of detecting variants. In the simplest cases, the samples are combined into a group of a single color and the data is analyzed as described previously. However, by maintaining separate colors for each sample set, additional information on how the bubbles were formed, whether by error or by repeats, presents itself.&lt;ref name=Iqbal /&gt; In 1997, the Department of Technology Development at Genzyme Genetics in Framingham, Massachusetts developed a new approach that provided a breakthrough in dealing with bubbles using the multiplex allele-specific diagnostic assay (MASDA). This program combines forward [[dot blot|dot-blot]], complex simultaneous [[probe hybridization]] and direct mutation detection to help solve the dual problem of multiple sample analysis.&lt;ref name=Shuber&gt;Shuber, A. P., Michalowsky, L. A., Nass, G. S., Skoletsky, J., Hire, L. M., Kotsopoulos, S. K., ... &amp; Klinger, K. W. (1997). High throughput parallel analysis of hundreds of patient samples for more than 100 mutations in multiple disease genes. ''Human molecular genetics, 6''(3), 337-347&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Genotyping ===

The colored de Bruijn graphs can be used to genotype any DNA sample at a known loci, even when the coverage is less than sufficient for variant assembly.&lt;ref name=Iqbal /&gt; The first step to this process is to construct a graph of the reference allele, known variants and data from the sample. The algorithm then calculates the likelihood of each genotype and accounts for the structure of the graph, both of the local and genome-wide sequence. This then generalizes to multiple allelic types and helps genotype complex and compound variants.&lt;ref name=Iqbal /&gt; This algorithm is used frequently, as there are no bubbles formed to deal with. This also directly helps find the more complicated issues in genes more direct than any of the three algorithms previously mentioned.

The '''demonic tube-nosed fruit bat''' (''Nyctimene masalai'') is a species of [[bat]] in the family [[Pteropodidae]]. It is [[endemic]] to [[Papua New Guinea]].  The [[holotype]] specimen was collected in 1979 on [[New Ireland (island)|New Ireland]], in the [[Bismarck Archipelago]].
It was [[species description|described]] as a new species in 1983.&lt;ref name="Smith et al., 1983" /&gt;
The range of the species may extend to other islands, however the extent of the range is not presently known.&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt;

==Taxonomy and etymology==
Based on its morphology, it was placed into the ''cephalotes'' [[species complex|species group]] of its genus when it was described. Species groups are hypotheses of evolutionary relationships, so it is thought that the demonic tube-nosed fruit bat is most closely related to the other members of the species group:
*[[Pallas's tube-nosed bat]], (''N. cephalotes'')
*[[Island tube-nosed fruit bat]], (''N. major'')
*[[Eastern tube-nosed bat]], (''N. robinsoni'')
*[[Nendo tube-nosed fruit bat]], (''N. santacrucis'')
*[[Umboi tube-nosed fruit bat]], (''N. vizcaccia'')&lt;ref name="Kitchener 1993"/&gt;
More recently, others have placed it in the ''albiventer'' species group.
Other members of the ''albiventer'' group included in this study were:
*[[Common tube-nosed fruit bat]], (''N. albiventer'')
*[[Island tube-nosed fruit bat]], (''N. major'')
*[[Umboi tube-nosed fruit bat]], (''N. vizcaccia'')
*[[Dragon tube-nosed fruit bat]], (''N. draconilla'')
*[[Malaita tube-nosed fruit bat]], (''N. malaitensis'')&lt;ref name="Bergmans 2001"/&gt;
The [[specific epithet (zoology)|specific epithet]] comes from the [[Tolai language|Tolai]] word "[[masalai]]", which Smith and Hood translate as "forest demon or devil".&lt;ref name="Smith et al., 1983" /&gt;{{rp|7}}
Some sources place the demonic tube-nosed fruit bat as [[Synonym (taxonomy)|synonymous]] with the [[common tube-nosed fruit bat]], ''Nyctimene albiventer''.&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt;

'''Efraim Racker''' (June 28, 1913 – September 9, 1991) was an [[Austria]]n [[biochemist]] who was responsible for identifying and purifying Factor 1 (F1), the first part of the [[ATP synthase]] enzyme to be characterised.  F1 is only a part of a larger ATP synthase complex known as Complex V.  It is a peripheral membrane protein attached to component Fo, which is integral to the membrane.&lt;ref name="Lehninger"&gt;Cox, Michael M. and David L. Nelson.

== Early life ==
Efraim Racker was born to a Jewish family in 1913 in [[Neu Sandez]], [[Poland]] (then [[Austrian Galicia]]), but he grew up in [[Vienna]]. His elder brother, [[Heinrich Racker]], was to become a famous [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]].  Efraim Racker was studying medicine at the [[University of Vienna]] when Hitler invaded in 1938.  Racker fled to Great Britain, where he took a job in a mental hospital in Wales.  His research focused on the biochemical causes for mental diseases.  During the war, Racker was given the opportunity to practice medicine, but he decided to move to the United States to continue his research.&lt;ref  name="Unraveling"&gt;Kresge, Nicole, Robert D. Simoni and Robert L. Hill.  "Unraveling the Enzymology of Oxidative Phosphorylation: The Work of Efraim Racker".  Journal of Biological Chemistry Vol. 281, Issue 4.  January 27, 2006.  http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/281/4/e4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In the U.S., he accepted a position as a research associate in physiology at the [[University of Minnesota]] in Minneapolis from 1941 to 1942.  While investigating the biochemical basis for brain diseases, he discovered that the [[polio]] virus inhibited [[glycolysis]] in the brains of mice.  He eventually left his research position for a job as a physician at the [[Harlem Hospital]] in New York City.  In 1944 he became an associate professor of [[microbiology]] at the [[New York University Medical School]], where he continued his work on glycolysis.&lt;ref name="Unraveling"/&gt;

In 1952 he accepted a position at [[Yale Medical School]], but left after two years to accept the position of chief of the Nutrition and Physiology Department at the [[Public Health Research Institute]] of the City of New York.  It was here that Racker demonstrated that glycolysis was dependent on ATPase and the continuous regeneration of ADP and phosphate.  Maynard E. Pullam joined Racker's staff in 1953, and decided to uncover the mechanism of ATP synthesis in [[mitochondria]] and [[chloroplast]]s.  Joined by Anima Datta and Harvey S. Penefsky, they set out to identify the enzymes used in ATP synthesis.&lt;ref name="Unraveling"/&gt;

Racker left the Public Health Research Institute in 1966 to found the biochemistry department at [[Cornell University]].  He continued his research at Cornell, and was awarded many honors and prizes, including the Warren Triennial Prize in 1974, the [[National Medal of Science]] in 1976, the Gairdner Award in 1980, and the America Society of Biological Chemistry's Sober Memorial Lectureship.  In addition, he was appointed to the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] and the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://efraimracker.library.cornell.edu/about/timeline|title=Biographical timeline {{!}} Efraim Racker|last=University|first=Cornell|website=efraimracker.library.cornell.edu|access-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Efraim Racker died in 1991, leaving colleague and friend Dr. Mossaad Abdel-Ghany to take care of his lab and graduate students, but not before coining the phrase, "Don’t waste clean thinking on dirty enzymes," which is often quoted as one of "The Ten Commandments of Enzymology".&lt;ref name="Unraveling"/&gt;

==Discovery==
Racker and his associates, Anima Datta, Maynard Pullmand, and Harvey Penefsky, worked to isolate the enzymes involved in ATP synthesis.  They observed that isolated mitochondrial fragments were capable of respiration but not able to synthesize ATP. Racker and his co-workers concluded that oxidative phosphorylation could be restored by addition of the supernatant from the [[Centrifuge|centrifuging]].  The complex making this restoration possible was named Factor 1 or F1 as it is a necessary coupling factor for ATPase activity.  This discovery of the first enzyme of oxidative phosphorylation was identified and purified in 1960.&lt;ref name="Efraim"&gt;"Efraim Racker". Biographical Memoirs, Volume 70.  National Academy of Sciences.  1996.  http://www.nap.edu/readingroom/books/biomems/eracker.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The factor that binds F1 to the membrane, Fo, was discovered later in conjunction with Yasuo Kagawa.  This particle was found to be sensitive to the antibiotic oligomycin and thus named Fo.  This discovery had the added benefit of silencing any critics of the role of F1 in oxidative phosphorylation because it conferred oligomycin sensitivity on the ATPase activity complex.&lt;ref name="Efraim"/&gt;
Once both of these factors were identified Racker was able to confirm [[Peter D. Mitchell]]'s hypothesis that contrary to popular opinion, ATP synthesis was not coupled to respiration through a high-energy intermediate but instead by a transmembrane proton gradient.&lt;ref name="Unraveling"/&gt;
[[Image:ATPsynthase.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Media:ATPsynthase.jpg|ATPsynthase http://www.atpsynthase.info/Basics.html]]]]

F1 is a critical part of ATP synthesis within the mitochondria.  In its absence, Complex V is not able to create the proton gradient necessary to produce ATP.&lt;ref name="Lehninger"/&gt; It is responsible for coupling the [[oxidation]] of nutrients to the synthesis of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphates.&lt;ref name="Efraim"/&gt;

In September 6, 1991, Racker was felled by  a severe [[stroke]], and died in [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]] three days after.

The '''electrogyration''' effect is the spatial dispersion [[phenomenon]], that consists in the change of [[optical activity]] (gyration) of crystals by a constant or time-varying [[electric field]]. Being a [[spatial dispersion]] effect, the induced optical activity exhibit different behavior under the operation of wave vector reversal, when compared with the [[Faraday effect]]:  the [[optical activity]] increment associated with the electrogyration effect changes its sign under that operation, contrary to the Faraday effect. Formally, it is a special case of gyroelectromagnetism obtained when the [[magnetic permeability]] tensor is diagonal.&lt;ref name="ingentaconnect.com"&gt;[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/vsp/jew/2003/00000017/00000008/art00011] Prati E.  (2003) "Propagation in gyroelectromagnetic guiding systems", ''J. of Electr. Wav. and Appl.'' '''17, 8''', 1177&lt;/ref&gt;

The electrogyration effect linear in the [[electric field]] occurs in crystals of all point groups of symmetry except for the three cubic – m3m, 432 and &lt;math&gt;\overline{4}3m\, &lt;/math&gt;. The effect proportional to the square of the [[electric field]] can exist only in crystals belonging to acentric [[point groups]] of symmetry.

== The historical background of discovery of electrogyration ==
The changes in the optical activity sign induced by the external electric field have been observed for the first time in ferroelectric crystals LiH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(SeO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by H. Futama and R. Pepinsky in 1961 
,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipap.jp/jpsj/current/index.htm] Futama H.  and Pepinsky R. (1962) "Optical activity in ferroelectric LiH3(SeO3)2", ''J. Phys. Soc. Jap.'' '''17''', 725&lt;/ref&gt; while switching enantiomorphous ferroelectric domains (the change in the point symmetry group of the crystal being 2/m«m). The observed phenomenon has been explained as a consequence of specific domain structure (a replacement of optic axes occurred under the switching), rather than the electrogyration induced by spontaneous polarization. 
The first description of electrogyration effect induced by the biasing field and spontaneous polarization at ferroelectric phase transitions has been proposed by K. Aizu in 1963 on the basis of third-rank axial tensors &lt;ref&gt;[http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PR/v133/i6A/pA1584_1] Aizu K. (1964) “Reversal in optical rotatory power – “gyroelectric” crystals and “hypergyroelectric” crystals”, Phys. Rev. 133 (6A) A1584–A1588&lt;/ref&gt; (the manuscript received on September 9, 1963). Probably, K. Aizu has been the first who defined the electro-gyration effect (”the rate of change of the gyration with the biasing electric field at zero value of the biasing electric field is provisionally referred to as “electrogyration””) and introduced the term “electrogyration” itself. 
Almost simultaneously with K. Aizu, I.S. Zheludev has suggested tensor description of the electrogyration in 1964 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifo.lviv.ua/institute/personal/publ/001.pdf] Zheludev I.S. (1964), "Axial tensors of the third rank and the physical effects they describe", ''Kristallografiya'' '''9''', 501-505.[(1965). ''Sov.Phys.Crystallogr.'' '''9''',418]&lt;/ref&gt; (the manuscript received on February 21, 1964). In this paper the electrogyration has been referred to as “electro-optic activity”.
In 1969, O.G. Vlokh has measured for the first time the electrogyration effect induced by external biasing field in the quartz crystal and determined the coefficient of quadratic electro-gyration effect &lt;ref name="ifo.lviv"&gt;[http://www.ifo.lviv.ua/institute/personal/publ/002.pdf] Vlokh O.G.(1970). "Electrooptical activity of quartz crystals", ''Ukr.Fiz.Zhurn.'''''15'''(5), 758-762.[Blokh O.G. (1970). "Electrooptical activity of quartz crystals", ''Sov.Phys. Ukr.Fiz.Zhurn.'''''15''', 771.]&lt;/ref&gt; (the manuscript received on July 7, 1969).&lt;br /&gt;
Thus, the electrogyration effect has been predicted simultaneously by Aizu K. and Zheludev I.S. in 1963–1964 and revealed experimentally in quartz crystals by Vlokh O.G. in 1969.&lt;ref name="ifo.lviv" /&gt; 
.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jetpletters.ac.ru/ps/712/article_11013.shtml] Vlokh O.G. (1971) "Electrogyration effects in quartz crystals", ''Pis.ZhETF.'' '''13''', 118-121 [Blokh O.G. (1971) "Electrogyration effects in quartz crystals", ''Sov.Phys. Pis.ZhETF.'' '''13''', 81-83.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a752268592~db=all~order=page] Vlokh O.G. (1987), "Electrogyration properties of crystals" ''Ferroelectrics'' '''75''', 119-137.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifo.lviv.ua/journal/UJPO_PDF/2001_2/2001-53-57_new.pdf] Vlokh O.G. (2001) "The historical background of the finding of electrogyration", ''Ukr.J.Phys.Opt.'', '''2'''(2), 53-57&lt;/ref&gt;
Later in 2003, the gyroelectricity has been extended to gyroelectromagnetic media,&lt;ref name="ingentaconnect.com"/&gt; which account for [[ferromagnetic semiconductors]] and engineered [[metamaterials]], for which gyroelectricity and gyromagnetism ([[Faraday effect]]) may occur at the same time.

== Description ==

=== Electrodynamics relations ===
The electric field and the electric displacement vectors of electromagnetic wave propagating in gyrotropic crystals may be written respectively as:

 &lt;math&gt;E_{i}=B_{ij}^{0}D_{j}+\tilde\delta_{ijk}\frac{\partial D_{j}}{\partial x_{k}}=B_{ij}^{0}D_{j}+(ie_{ijl}\tilde{g}_{lk}k_k)D_{j}\, &lt;/math&gt;,				(1)

or
 &lt;math&gt;D_{i}=\epsilon_{ij}^{0}E_{j}+\delta_{ijk}\frac{\partial E_{j}}{\partial x_{k}}=\epsilon_{ij}^{0}E_{j}+(ie_{ijl}{g}_{lk}k_k)E_{j}\, &lt;/math&gt;,				(2)&lt;br /&gt;
where   &lt;math&gt;B_{ij}^{0}&lt;/math&gt;  is the optical frequency impermeability [[tensor]],   &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_{ij}^{0}&lt;/math&gt; the dielectric permittivity [[tensor]],  &lt;math&gt;\tilde{g}_{lk}\overline{n}=g_{kl}&lt;/math&gt;,  &lt;math&gt;\overline{n}&lt;/math&gt; the mean refractive index,  &lt;math&gt;D_{j}\, &lt;/math&gt; - induction, &lt;math&gt;\delta_{ijk}\, &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\tilde\delta_{ijk}&lt;/math&gt;  polar third rank [[tensors]],  &lt;math&gt;e_{ijl}\, &lt;/math&gt; the unit antisymmetric Levi-Civit pseudo-tensor,   &lt;math&gt;k_k\, &lt;/math&gt; the [[wave vector]], and &lt;math&gt;g_{lk}\, &lt;/math&gt;,  &lt;math&gt;\tilde{g}_{lk}&lt;/math&gt; the second rank gyration pseudo-tensors. The specific rotation angle of the polarization plane   &lt;math&gt;\rho\, &lt;/math&gt; caused by the natural [[optical activity]] is defined by the relation:
 &lt;math&gt;\rho=\frac{\pi}{\lambda n}g_{lk}l_{l}l_{k}=\frac{\pi}{\lambda n}G\, &lt;/math&gt;,							(3)&lt;br /&gt;
where  &lt;math&gt;n\, &lt;/math&gt;  is  the refractive index,  &lt;math&gt;\lambda\, &lt;/math&gt; the wavelength,   &lt;math&gt;l_{l}\, &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;l_{k}\, &lt;/math&gt; the transformation coefficients between the Cartesian and spherical coordinate systems  (&lt;math&gt;l_{1}=\sin \Theta \cos \varphi\, &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;l_{2}=\sin \Theta \sin \varphi, l_{3}=\cos \Theta&lt;/math&gt;), and  &lt;math&gt;G\, &lt;/math&gt; the pseudo-scalar gyration parameter.
The electro-gyration increment of gyration [[tensor]] occurred under the action of [[electric field]] &lt;math&gt;E_{m}\, &lt;/math&gt; or/and &lt;math&gt;E_{n}\, &lt;/math&gt; is written as:

 &lt;math&gt;\Delta g_{lk}=\gamma _{lkm}E_{m}+\beta _{lkmn}E_{m}E_{n}\, &lt;/math&gt;,						(4)

where  &lt;math&gt;\gamma _{lkm}\, &lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;\beta _{lkmn}\, &lt;/math&gt; are third- and fourth-rank axial tensors describing the linear and quadratic electrogyration, respectively. In the absence of linear [[birefringence]], electrogyration increment of the specific rotatory power is given by:
 &lt;math&gt;\Delta \rho=\frac{\pi}{\lambda n}g_{lk}l_{l}l_{k}=\frac{\pi}{\lambda n}\Delta G=\frac{\pi}{\lambda n}(\gamma _{lkm}E_{m}+\beta _{lkmn}E_{m}E_{n})l_{l}l_{k}&lt;/math&gt;.			(5)
The electrogyration effect may be also induced by spontaneous polarization &lt;math&gt;P_{m}^{s}P_{n}^{s}\, &lt;/math&gt; appearing in the course of ferroelectric phase transitions 
:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifo.lviv.ua/institute/personal/publ/006.pdf] Vlokh O.G., Kutniy I.V., Lazko L.A., and Nesterenko V.Ya. (1971) "Electrogyration of crystals and phase transitions", ''Izv.AN SSSR, ser.fiz.'' '''XXXV''' (9), 1852-1855.&lt;/ref&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;\Delta \rho=\frac{\pi}{\lambda n}g_{lk}l_{l}l_{k}=\frac{\pi}{\lambda n}\Delta G=\frac{\pi}{\lambda n}(\tilde\gamma _{lkm}P_{m}^{s}+\tilde\beta _{lkmn}P_{m}^{s}P_{n}^{s})l_{l}l_{k}&lt;/math&gt;.			(6)

=== Explanation on the basis of symmetry approach ===
The electrogyration effect can be easy explained on the basis of Curie and Neumann symmetry principles. In the [[crystals]] that exhibit centre of symmetry, natural gyration can not exist, since, due to the Neumann principle, the point symmetry group of the medium should be a subgroup of the symmetry group that describes the phenomena, which are properties of this medium. As a result, the gyration [[tensor]] possessing a symmetry of second-rank axial tensor - &lt;math&gt;\infty 2\, &lt;/math&gt; is not a subgroup of centrosymmetric media and so the natural [[optical activity]] cannot exist in such media. According to the Curie symmetry principle, external actions reduce the symmetry group of the medium down to the group defined by intersection of the symmetry groups of the action and the medium. When the [[electric field]] (with the symmetry of polar vector,  &lt;math&gt;\infty mm\, &lt;/math&gt;) influences the crystal which possess the inversion centre, the symmetry group of the crystal should be lowered to the acentric one, thus permitting the appearance of gyration. However, in case of the quadratic electrogyration effect, the symmetry of the action should be considered as that of the dyad product  &lt;math&gt;E_{m}E_{n} \, &lt;/math&gt; or, what is the same, the symmetry of a polar second-rank [[tensor]]  (&lt;math&gt;\infty /mmm\, &lt;/math&gt;). Such a centrosymmetric action cannot lead to  lowering of centrosymmetric symmetry of crystal to acentric states. This is the reason why the quadratic electrogyration exists only in the acentric crystals.

=== Eigenwaves in the presence of electrogyration ===
In a general case of light propagation along optically anisotropic directions, the eigenwaves become elliptically polarized in the presence of electrogyration effect, including rotation of the azimuth of polarization ellipse. Then the corresponding ellipticity &lt;math&gt;\kappa \, &lt;/math&gt; and the azimuth &lt;math&gt;\chi \, &lt;/math&gt; are defined respectively by the relations
 &lt;math&gt;\kappa =\frac{\Delta G}{2\Delta n\overline{n}}\, &lt;/math&gt;,								(7)&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;\tan 2(\alpha -\chi )=\frac{2\kappa }{1+\kappa ^2}\tan \boldsymbol{\Gamma } \left ( 1+\frac{P\tan 2\alpha +(1-R)}{R+\tan ^22\alpha } \right )\, &lt;/math&gt;, 		(8)		
where &lt;math&gt;\alpha \, &lt;/math&gt; is the polarization azimuth of the incident light with respect to the principal indicatrix axis,  &lt;math&gt;\Delta n\, &lt;/math&gt; the linear [[birefringence]],  &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\Gamma \, &lt;/math&gt; the phase retardation, &lt;math&gt;P=\frac{(1-\kappa ^2)^2}{2\kappa (1+\kappa ^2)}\, &lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;R=\left (\frac{2\kappa }{1+\kappa ^2}\right )^2+\left (\frac{1-\kappa ^2}{1+\kappa ^2}\right )^2\, &lt;/math&gt;. In the case of light propagation along optically isotropic directions (i.e., the optic axes), the eigenwave become circularly polarized (&lt;math&gt;\kappa =1\, &lt;/math&gt;), with different phase velocities and different signs of [[circular polarization]] (left and right ones). Hence the relation (8) may be simplified so as to describe a pure polarization plane rotation:
 &lt;math&gt;2(\alpha -\chi )=\boldsymbol\Gamma \, &lt;/math&gt;, 								(9)
or 
 &lt;math&gt;\rho d=\alpha -\frac{\boldsymbol\Gamma}{2}\, &lt;/math&gt;,							(10)
where  &lt;math&gt;d\, &lt;/math&gt; - is the sample thickness along the direction of light propagation.
For the directions of light propagation far from the optic axis, the ellipticity &lt;math&gt;\kappa \, &lt;/math&gt;  is small and so one can neglect the terms proportional to &lt;math&gt;\kappa ^2\, &lt;/math&gt; in Eq.(8). Thus, in order to describe the polarization  azimuth at  &lt;math&gt;\alpha =0\, &lt;/math&gt; and the gyration tensor,  simplified relations

 &lt;math&gt;\tan 2\chi =-2\kappa \sin \boldsymbol\Gamma\, &lt;/math&gt;,							(11)
or
 &lt;math&gt;g_{kl}=2\chi \Delta n\overline{n}\, &lt;/math&gt;.								(12)
are often used.
According to Eq.(11), when the light propagates along anisotropic directions, the [[gyration]] (or the electro-gyration) effects manifest themselves as oscillations of the azimuth of polarization ellipse occurring with changing phase retardation &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\Gamma\, &lt;/math&gt; .

'''''Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage''''' is a bestselling book written by [[Alfred Lansing]]. It was first published in 1959.

The book recounts the failure of the [[Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition]] led by Sir [[Ernest Shackleton]] in its attempt to cross the Antarctic continent in 1914 and the subsequent struggle for survival endured by the twenty-eight man crew for almost two years. The book's title refers to the ship Shackleton used for the expedition, the ''[[Endurance (1912 ship)|Endurance]]''. The ship was beset and eventually crushed by ice floes in the [[Weddell Sea]] leaving the men stranded on the pack ice. All in all the crew drifted on the ice for just over a year. They were able to launch their boats and somehow managed to land them safely on [[Elephant Island]]. Shackleton then led a crew of five aboard the ''[[James Caird (boat)|James Caird]]'' through the [[Drake Passage]] and miraculously reached [[South Georgia Island]] 650 nautical miles away. He then took two of those men on the first successful overland crossing of the island. Three months later he was finally able to rescue the remaining crew members they had left behind on Elephant Island.

Virtually every diary kept during the expedition was made available to the author and almost all the surviving members at the time of writing submitted to lengthy interviews. The most significant contribution came from Dr. [[Alexander Macklin]], one of the ship's surgeons, who provided Lansing with many diaries, a detailed account of the perilous journey the crew made to Elephant Island, and months of advice.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9263">'''Flow Cytometry Standard''' ('''FCS''') is a data file standard for the reading and writing of data from [[flow cytometry]] experiments. The FCS specification has traditionally been developed and maintained by the [[International Society for Advancement of Cytometry]] (ISAC).&lt;ref name="ISAC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://isac-net.org/|title=International Society for Advancement of Cytometry|accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; FCS used to be the only widely adopted file format in flow cytometry. Recently, additional standard file formats have been developed by ISAC.

==File Format==
The FCS file format describes a file that is a combination of textual data followed by binary data. The order of the file layout is as follows:
# HEADER segment
# TEXT segment
# DATA segment
# Optional ANALYSIS segment
# CRC value
# Optional OTHER segments

The HEADER segment is an ASCII text string that begins by identifying the version of the FCS standard used, followed by three pairs of byte offsets that designate the positions of the TEXT, DATA, and ANALYSIS segments. An example header segment is given below
&lt;pre&gt;FCS3.0          58    4380    4381    5586       0       0&lt;/pre&gt;
Because the field width of the header segment byte positions is constrained by 8 characters, the maximum position it is capable of storing is 99,999,999. Anything beyond that is encoded as a 0 for both the start and end position, and the corresponding TEXT segment keyword is used instead.

The text segment is an ASCII text string that is divided into a series of key-value pairs that are delimited by some chosen character, e.g. '|'. The first character immediately following the header segment is the delimiter. An example of a header and text segment is given below
&lt;pre&gt;FCS3.0          58    4380    4381    5586       0       0|$BEGINANALYSIS|0|$BEGINDATA|4381|$BEGINSTEXT|0|$BTIM|08:24:37.64|$BYTEORD|1,2,3,4|$CELLS|RBC|...|&lt;/pre&gt;
To be a valid FCS file, the text segment must contain all required keywords, which describe the DATA segment format and encoding. For FCS version 3.1, the required FCS primary TEXT segment keywords are as follows: 
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Keyword !! Description
|-
| $BEGINANALYSIS || Byte-offset to the beginning of the ANALYSIS segment.
|-
| $BEGINDATA || Byte-offset to the beginning of the DATA segment.
|-
| $BEGINSTEXT || Byte-offset to the beginning of a supplemental TEXT segment.
|-
| $BYTEORD || Byte order for data acquisition computer.
|-
| $DATATYPE || Type of data in DATA segment (ASCII, integer, floating point).
|-
| $ENDANALYSIS || Byte-offset to the last byte of the ANALYSIS segment.
|-
| $ENDDATA || Byte-offset to the last byte of the DATA segment.
|-
| $ENDSTEXT || Byte-offset to the last byte of a supplemental TEXT segment.
|-
| $MODE || Data mode (list mode - preferred, histogram - deprecated).
|-
| $NEXTDATA || Byte offset to next data set in the file.
|-
| $PAR || Number of parameters in an event.
|-
| $PnB || Number of bits reserved for parameter number n.
|-
| $PnE || Amplification type for parameter n.
|-
| $PnN || Short name for parameter n.
|-
| $PnR || Range for parameter number n.
|-
| $TOT || Total number of events in the data set. 
|}

The DATA segment of the FCS file follows after the TEXT segment and is laid out event-wise (row-wise) according to the order described in the parameters (a.k.a. channels) $P1N $P2N...$PnN. An event is either an actual biological cell or some other mass that was large enough to trigger the data acquisition capturing device of the flow cytometer instrument. Data segments hold the following layout:
&lt;pre&gt;Data Segment
[Event1][Event2][Event3]...[Event$TOT]&lt;/pre&gt;
Each event is laid out according to the number of bytes described by $PnB for each parameter. These bytes are to be interpreted according to the combination specified by $BYTEORD and $DATATYPE.
&lt;pre&gt;Event
[$P1B][$P2B][$P3B]...[$PnB]
&lt;/pre&gt;

==Data structure==
Flow cytometry data is typically saved for analysis in the form of an [[Array (data type)|array]], with fluorescence and scatter channels represented in columns, and individual "events" (most of which are cells) forming the rows. 
The number of events acquired from each sample usually ranges between the low thousands and the low millions.
[[File:Fcsmatrix.svg|thumb|400px|left|Representation of flow cytometry data from an instrument with three scatter channels and 13 fluorescent channels. Only the values for the first 30 (of hundreds of thousands) of cells are shown.]]

==History==
The first version of a Flow Cytometry Standard (FCS) was developed in 1984.&lt;ref name=FCS1&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Murphy | first1 = R. F. | last2 = Chused | first2 = T. M. | doi = 10.1002/cyto.990050521 | title = A proposal for a flow cytometric data file standard | journal = Cytometry | volume = 5 | issue = 5 | pages = 553–555 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6489069 | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, FCS became the standard [[file format]] supported by all flow cytometry software and hardware vendors. FCS is a [[binary file]] format with three main segments: a text segment containing meta data in keyword/value pairs structures, a data segment usually containing a matrix of detected expression values (so called list mode format), and a rarely used analysis segment.

Over the years, updates were incorporated to adapt to technological advancements in both flow cytometry and computing technologies.

In 1990, FCS 2.0  was introduced.&lt;ref name=FCS2&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Dean | first1 = P. N. | last2 = Bagwell | first2 = C. B. | last3 = Lindmo | first3 = T. | last4 = Murphy | first4 = R.

FCS 2.0 was followed by FCS 3.0 in 1997, which introduced the possibility of storing data sets larger than 100MB.&lt;ref name=FCS3&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Seamer | first1 = L. C. | last2 = Bagwell | first2 = C. B. | last3 = Barden | first3 = L. | last4 = Redelman | first4 = D. | last5 = Salzman | first5 = G. C. | last6 = Wood | first6 = J. C.

The latest version, FCS 3.1, was introduced in 2010.&lt;ref name=FCS31&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Spidlen | first1 = J. | last2 = Moore | first2 = W. | last3 = Parks | first3 = D. | last4 = Goldberg | first4 = M. | last5 = Bray | first5 = C. | last6 = Bierre | first6 = P. | last7 = Gorombey | first7 = P. | last8 = Hyun | first8 = B. | last9 = Hubbard | first9 = M. | last10 = Lange | doi = 10.1002/cyto.a.20825 | first10 = S. | last11 = Lefebvre | first11 = R. | last12 = Leif | first12 = R. | last13 = Novo | first13 = D. | last14 = Ostruszka | first14 = L. | last15 = Treister | first15 = A. | last16 = Wood | first16 = J. | last17 = Murphy | first17 = R.

Changes included in FCS 3.1 address potential ambiguities in the previous versions and provide a more robust standard. They include simplified support for international characters and improved support for storing compensation. The major additions are support for preferred display scale, a standardized way of capturing the [[Biological specimen|sample]] volume, information about the origins of the data file, and support for plate and well identification in high throughput, plate based experiments.

[[File:Abies procera 'Glauca' - 20101120-02.jpg|thumb|right|Seedlings of ''[[Abies procera]]'' sometimes arise that have attractive silvery-blue foliage. The name ''Abies procera'' Rehder forma ''glauca'' (Ravenscr.) Rehder has been created for these. However, if the plants are selectively propagated for the [[horticulture]] trade, a [[cultivar]] name is generally used instead.]]

In [[botanical nomenclature]], a '''''form''''' (''forma'', plural ''formae'') is one of the "secondary" [[taxonomic rank]]s, below that of [[Variety (biology)|variety]], which in turn is below that of species; it is an [[infraspecific taxon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=McNeill, J. |author2=Barrie, F.R. |author3=Buck, W.R. |author4=Demoulin, V. |author5=Greuter, W. |author6=Hawksworth, D.L. |author7=Herendeen, P.S. |author8=Knapp, S. |author9=Marhold, K. |author10=Prado, J. |author11=Prud'homme Van Reine, W.F. |author12=Smith, G.F. |author13=Wiersema, J.H. |author14=Turland, N.J. |year=2012 |volume=Regnum Vegetabile 154 |title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (Melbourne Code) adopted by the Eighteenth International Botanical Congress Melbourne, Australia, July 2011 |publisher=A.R.G.

Article 4&lt;/ref&gt; If more than three ranks are listed in describing a taxon, the "classification" is being specified, but only three parts make up the "name" of the taxon: a [[genus]] name, a [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]], and an [[infraspecific epithet]].

The abbreviation "f." or the full "forma" should be put before the infraspecific epithet to indicate the rank. It is not italicised.

For example:
* ''[[Acanthocalycium]] spiniflorum'' f. ''klimpelianum'' or
** ''Acanthocalycium spiniflorum'' forma ''klimpelianum'' (Weidlich &amp; Werderm.) Donald
* ''[[Crataegus aestivalis]]'' (Walter) Torr. &amp; A.Gray var. ''cerasoides'' Sarg. f. ''luculenta'' Sarg. is a classification of a plant whose name is:

A form usually designates a group with a noticeable morphological deviation. The usual taxonomic practice is that the individuals classified within the form are not necessarily known to be closely related (they may not form a [[clade]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author1=Hamilton, C.W. |author2=Reichard, S.H. |year=1992 |title=Current Practice in the Use of Subspecies, Variety, and Forma in the Classification of Wild Plants |journal=Taxon |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=485–498 |jstor=1222819 |doi=10.2307/1222819 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, white-flowered plants of species that usually have coloured flowers can be grouped and named (e.g., as "f. ''alba''"). '''''Formae apomicticae''''' are sometimes named among plants that reproduce asexually, by [[apomixis]]. There are theoretically countless numbers of forms based on minor genetic differences, and only a few that have particular significance are likely to be named.

The '''International Mathematical Union''' ('''IMU''') is an international [[non-governmental organization]] devoted to international cooperation in the field of [[mathematics]] across the world. It is a member of the [[International Council for Science]] (ICSU) and supports the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]]. Its members are national mathematics organizations from more than 80 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mathunion.org/membership/imu-members|title=International Mathematical Union (IMU): sorted by names|first=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The objectives of the International Mathematical Union (IMU) are: promoting international cooperation in mathematics, supporting and assisting the International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM) and other international scientific meetings/conferences, acknowledging outstanding research contributions to mathematics through the awarding of scientific prizes, and encouraging and supporting other international mathematical activities, considered likely to contribute to the development of mathematical science in any of its aspects, whether pure, applied, or educational.

The IMU was established in 1920, but dissolved in September 1932 and then re-established 1950 de facto at the Constitutive Convention in New York, de jure on September 10, 1951, when ten countries had become members. The last milestone was the General Assembly in March 1952, in Rome, Italy where the activities of the new IMU were inaugurated and the first Executive Committee, President and various commissions where elected. In 1952 the IMU was also readmitted to the ICSU. The past president of the Union is [[Ingrid Daubechies]] (2011–2014). The current president is [[Shigefumi Mori]] who is the first head of the group from Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2014/08/12/national/kyoto-university-professor-elected-head-international-mathematical-union/|title=Kyoto University professor elected head of International Mathematical Union|date=12 August 2014|publisher=|accessdate=19 November 2017|via=Japan Times Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 16th meeting of the IMU General Assembly in Bangalore, India, in August 2010, [[Berlin]] was chosen as the location of the permanent office of the IMU, which was opened on January 1, 2011, and is hosted by the Weierstrass Institute for Applied Analysis and Stochastics  (WIAS), an institute of the [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Scientific Community]], with about 120 scientists engaging in mathematical research applied to complex problems in industry and commerce.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.icm2010.org.in/imu-general-assembley-2010 |title=IMU General Assembly in Bangalore, India in August 2010 |access-date=2011-05-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903052817/http://www.icm2010.org.in/imu-general-assembley-2010 |archive-date=2011-09-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wias-berlin.de/|title=Weierstrass Institute|website=www.wias-berlin.de|accessdate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commissions and committees==
IMU has a close relationship to mathematics education through its [[International Commission on Mathematical Instruction]] (ICMI). This commission is organized similarly to IMU with its own Executive Committee and General Assembly.

Developing countries are a high priority for the IMU and a significant percentage of its budget, including grants received from individuals, mathematical societies, foundations, and funding agencies, is spent on activities for developing countries. Since 2011 this has been coordinated by the [http://www.mathunion.org/cdc Commission for Developing Countries (CDC)].

The [https://www.mathunion.org/cwm Committee for Women in Mathematics (CWM)] is concerned with issues related to women in mathematics worldwide. It organizes the [https://www.worldwomeninmaths.org/ World Meeting for Women in Mathematics &lt;math display="inline"&gt;((\mathrm{WM})^2)&lt;/math&gt;] as a satellite event of ICM.

The [[International Commission on the History of Mathematics]] (ICHM) is operated jointly by the IMU and the Division of the History of Science (DHS) of the [[International Union of History and Philosophy of Science]] (IUHPS).

The Committee on Electronic Information and Communication (CEIC) advises IMU on matters concerning mathematical information, communication, and publishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mathunion.org/ceic|title=CEIC|first=IMU Committee on Electronic Information and|last=Communication|website=www.mathunion.org|accessdate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prizes==
The scientific prizes awarded by the IMU are deemed to be the highest distinctions in the mathematical world.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} The opening ceremony of the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] (ICM) is where the awards are presented: [[Fields Medal]]s (two to four medals are given since 1936), the Rolf [[Nevanlinna Prize]] (since 1986), the [[Carl Friedrich Gauss Prize]] (since 2006), and the [[Chern Medal|Chern Medal Award]] (since 2010).

==Membership and General Assembly==
The IMU's members are Member Countries and each Member country is represented through an Adhering Organization, which may be its principal academy, a mathematical society, its research council or some other institution or association of institutions, or an appropriate agency of its government. A country starting to develop its mathematical culture and interested in building links to mathematicians all over the world is invited to join IMU as an Associate Member. For the purpose of facilitating jointly sponsored activities and jointly pursuing the objectives of the IMU, multinational mathematical societies and professional societies can join IMU as an Affiliate Member. Every four years the IMU membership gathers in a General Assembly (GA) which consists of delegates appointed by the Adhering Organizations, together with the members of the Executive Committee. All important decisions are made at the GA, including the election of the officers, establishment of commissions, the approval of the budget, and any changes to the statutes and by-laws.

==Organization and Executive Committee==
The International Mathematical Union is administered by an Executive Committee (EC) which conducts the business of the Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mathunion.org/organization/imu-executive-committee|title=International Mathematical Union (IMU): Executive Committee|first=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EC consists of the President, two Vice-Presidents, the Secretary, six Members-at-Large, all elected for a term of four years, and the Past President. The EC is responsible for all policy matters and for tasks, such as choosing the members of the ICM Program Committee and various prize committees.

==Publications==
Every two months IMU publishes an electronic newsletter, ''IMU-Net'', that aims to improve communication between IMU and the worldwide mathematical community by reporting on decisions and recommendations of the Union, major international mathematical events and developments, and on other topics of general mathematical interest. IMU Bulletins are published annually with the aim to inform IMU’s members about the Union’s current activities. In 2009 IMU published the document ''Best Current Practices for Journals''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mathunion.org/fileadmin/CEIC/bestpractice/bpfinal.pdf|title=Best Current Practices for Journals|publisher=|accessdate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==IMU’s Involvement in Developing Countries==
The IMU took its first organized steps towards the promotion of mathematics in developing countries in the early 1970s and has, since then supported various activities. In 2010 IMU formed the Commission for Developing Countries (CDC) which brings together all of the past and current initiatives in support of mathematics and mathematicians in the developing world.

Some IMU Supported Initiatives:
*''Grants Program for Mathematicians:'' The Commission for Developing Countries supports research travel of mathematicians based in developing countries as well as mathematics research conferences in the developing world through its Grants Program which is open to mathematicians throughout the developing world, including countries that are not (yet) members of the IMU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mathunion.org/cdc/grants/|title=Grants - CDC|first=IMU Commission for Developing|last=Countries|website=www.mathunion.org|accessdate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''African Mathematics Millennium Science Initiative'' (AMMSI) is a network of mathematics centers in sub-Saharan Africa that organizes conferences and workshops, visiting lectureships and an extensive scholarship program for mathematics graduate students doing PhD work on the African continent.
*''Mentoring African Research in Mathematics (MARM):'' IMU supported the London Mathematical Society (LMS) in founding the MARM programme, which supports mathematics and its teaching in the countries of sub-Saharan Africa via a mentoring partnership between mathematicians in the United Kingdom and African colleagues, together with their students. It focuses on cultivating long-term mentoring relations between individual mathematicians and students.
*''Volunteer Lecturer Program'' (VLP) of IMU identifies mathematicians interested in contributing to the formation of young mathematicians in the developing world. The Volunteer Lecturer Program maintains a database of mathematic volunteers willing to offer month-long intensive courses at the advanced undergraduate or graduate level in degree programmes at universities in the developing world. IMU also seeks applications from universities and mathematics degree programmes in the developing world that are in need of volunteer lecturers, and that can provide the necessary conditions for productive collaboration in the teaching of advanced mathematics.

IMU also supports the ''[[International Commission on Mathematical Instruction]]'' (ICMI) with its programmes, exhibits and workshops in emerging countries, especially in Asia and Africa.

IMU released a report in 2008, ''Mathematics in Africa: Challenges and Opportunities'', on the current state of mathematics in Africa and on opportunities for new initiatives to support mathematical development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mathunion.org/fileadmin/IMU/Report/Mathematics_in_Africa_Challenges___Opportunities.pdf|title=Mathematics in Africa: Challenges and Opportunities|publisher=|accessdate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the IMU's Commission for Developing Countries CDC released an update of the report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mathunion.org/fileadmin/CDC/cdc-uploads/CDC_MENAO/Africa_Report.pdf|title=''Mathematics in Africa'' 2014 Update|publisher=|accessdate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, reports about ''Mathematics in Latin America and the Caribbean and South East Asia''.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.mathunion.org/fileadmin/CDC/cdc-uploads/CDC_MENAO/Mathematics_in_Latin_America_and_the_Caribbean.Report.pdf ''Mathematics in Latin America'' report]&lt;/ref&gt; were published.

In July 2014 IMU released the report: The International Mathematical Union in the Developing World: Past, Present and Future (July 2014).
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mathunion.org/fileadmin/CDC/cdc-uploads/CVgrantsConference/The_INTERNATIONAL_MATHEMATICAL_UNION_in_the_DEVELOPING_WORLD-_Past__Present_and_Future.pdf|title=''The International Mathematical Union in the Developing World''|publisher=|accessdate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== MENAO Symposium at the ICM ==

In 2014, the IMU held a day-long symposium prior to the opening of the International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM), entitled ''Mathematics in Emerging Nations: Achievements and Opportunities'' (MENAO). Approximately 260 participants from around the world, including representatives of embassies, scientific institutions, private business and foundations attended this session. Attendees heard inspiring stories of individual mathematicians and specific developing nations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eODi4b5d27Y&amp;list=PL0c-546bsozhAecE1btXl18BO8p1fL_7u here MENAO Channel] at Youtube&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MENAO (12 August 2014)[http://www.mathunion.org/fileadmin/CDC/cdc-uploads/menao_doku_141120.pdf Symposium Report: Mathematics in Emerging Nations: Achievements and Opportunities]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Juice fasting''', also known as '''juice cleansing''', is a [[fad diet]] in which a person consumes only [[fruit juice|fruit]] and [[vegetable juice]]s while abstaining from solid food consumption. It is used for [[detoxification (alternative medicine)|detoxification]], an [[alternative medicine]] treatment, and is often part of [[Detoxification (alternative medicine)#Detox diets|detox diets]]. The diet can typically last for two to seven days and involve a number of fruits and vegetables and even spices that are not among the juices typically sold or consumed in the average Western diet. 

This diet is sometimes promoted with implausible and unsubstantiated claims about its [[Health benefit (medicine)|health benefits]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Do Juice Cleanses Work? 10 Truths About The Fad |date=27 May 2015 |publisher=Huffington Post |author=Valiant, Melissa |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2012/03/22/do-juice-cleanses-work_n_1372305.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
Catherine Collins, chief dietician of [[St George's, University of London|St George's Hospital Medical School]] in London, England, states that: "The concept of ‘[[Detoxification (alternative medicine)|detox]]’ is a marketing myth rather than a physiological entity. The idea that an avalanche of vitamins, minerals, and laxatives taken over a 2 to 7 day period can have a long-lasting benefit for the body is also a marketing myth."&lt;ref name="senseaboutscience.org.uk"&gt;[http://www.senseaboutscience.org/pages/debunking-detox.html Debunking detox] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140418091439/http://www.senseaboutscience.org/pages/debunking-detox.html |date=2014-04-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Detox diets, depending on the type and duration, are potentially dangerous and can cause various health problems including muscle loss and an unhealthy regaining of fat after the detox ends.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webmd.com/diet/features/detox-diets-purging-myths The Truth About Detox Diets]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''largest prehistoric organisms''' include both [[vertebrate]] and [[invertebrate]] species. Many are described below, along with their typical range of size (for the general dates of extinction, see the link to each). Many species mentioned might not actually be the largest representative of their clade due to the incompleteness of the [[fossil record]] and many of the sizes given are merely estimates since no complete specimen have been found. Their body mass, especially, is mostly conjecture because soft tissue was rarely fossilized. Generally the size of extinct species was subject to energetic&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Carbone | first1=Chris | last2=Teacher | first2=Amber | last3=Rowcliffe | first3=J |title=The Costs of Carnivory |journal=PLoS Biology |volume=5 |issue=2 |page=e22 |url=http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.0050022 |accessdate=2009-12-28 | doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0050022 | year=2007 | pmid=17227145 | pmc=1769424}}&lt;/ref&gt; and biomechanical constraints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hokkanen|first=J.E.I. |date=21 February 1986|title=The size of the largest land animal|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|publisher=Elsevier Ltd|volume= 118| issue = 4|pages=491–499|doi=10.1016/S0022-5193(86)80167-9|pmid=3713220}}

=== Mammals ([[Mammalia]]) ===

==== Monotremes ([[Monotremata]]) ====
The largest-known [[monotreme]] (egg-laying mammal) ever was the extinct [[long-beaked echidna]] species known as ''[[Zaglossus hacketti]]'', known from a couple of bones found in Western Australia. It was the size of a sheep, weighing probably up to {{cvt|30|kg}}.&lt;ref name="TourismWA"&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff |title =''Zaglossus hacketti'' – extinct giant echidna |url=http://www.megafauna.com.au/view/megafauna/zaglossus-hacketti |work=Tourism Western Australia |accessdate=2014-04-28 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140126010215/http://www.megafauna.com.au/view/megafauna/zaglossus-hacketti |archivedate=2014-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hippopotamus gorgops e.jpg|thumb|The extinct ''[[Hippopotamus gorgops]]'' is the most massive of the fossil even-toed ungulates.]]
* The largest-known [[Artiodactyla|artiodactyl]] was ''[[Hippopotamus gorgops]]'' with a length of {{cvt|4.3|m}} and a height of {{cvt|2.1|m}}. ''[[Bison latifrons]]'' reached a shoulder height of {{cvt|2.5|m}}, and had horns that spanned over {{cvt|2|m}}. The largest extinct bovid is [[Aurochs]] (''Bos primigenius'') with an average height at the shoulders of {{cvt|155|-|180|cm}} in bulls and {{cvt|135|-|155|cm}} in cows, while aurochs populations in Hungary had bulls reaching {{cvt|155|–|160|cm}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1 = Kysely | first1 = René | title = Aurochs and potential crossbreeding with domestic cattle in Central Europe in the Eneolithic period.

==== Carnivores ([[Carnivora]]) ====
* The largest terrestrial known [[carnivora]]n and the largest-known [[bear]] as well as the largest-known mammalian land-predator of all time was ''[[Arctotherium angustidens]]'' or the South American short-faced bears. A [[humerus]] of ''A. angustidens'' from [[Buenos Aires]] indicate that the large males could have weighed {{cvt|1,588|-|1,749|kg}} and standing at least {{cvt|11|ft|order=flip}} tall on the hind-limbs.&lt;ref name="Soibelzon2"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Soibelzon | first = L.

''[[Megalictis]]'' was thought to be around the size of a black bear according to old estimates. Newer estimates, however, significantly downgrade its size, although, at a maximum weight more than twice that of a wolverine, it is larger than most (if not all) living mustelids.

==== Armadillos, glyptodonts and pampatheres ([[Cingulata]]) ====
The largest [[Cingulata|cingulate]] known is ''[[Doedicurus]]'', at {{cvt|3.8|m}} long and reaching a mass of approximately {{cvt|1910|to|2370|kg|ST}} ''[[Glyptodon]]'' easily topped {{cvt|3.3|m}} and {{cvt|2|tonne|ST}}.

==== Hedgehogs, gymnures, shrews, and moles ([[Erinaceomorpha]] and [[Soricomorpha]]) ====
The largest-known animal of this group was ''[[Deinogalerix]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Villier | first1 = Boris | year = 2010 | title = Deinogalerix: a giant hedgehog from the Miocene | journal = Annali dell’Università di Ferrara | volume=6| pages=93–102 |ISSN = 1824-2707}}&lt;/ref&gt; measuring up to {{cvt|60|cm}} in total length, with a skull up to {{cvt|20|cm}} long. It occupied the same ecological niche as dogs and cats today.

==== Rabbits, hares, and pikas ([[Lagomorpha]]) ====
The largest-known prehistoric lagomorph is [[Minorcan giant lagomorph]] (''Nuralagus rex'') at {{cvt|23|kg}}.

==== Symmoriid ([[Symmoriida]]) ====
The largest-known symmoriid was ''[[Stethacanthus]]'' at {{cvt|2|m}} long.

==== Eugenedont ([[Eugeneodontida]]) ====
The largest-known eugenedont is a yet unnamed species of ''[[Helicoprion]]'' discovered in Idaho. The specimens suggest an animal that possibly exceeded {{cvt|12|m}} in length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eartharchives.org/articles/buzzsaw-toothed-leviathans-cruised-the-ancient-seas/|title=Buzzsaw-toothed leviathans cruised the ancient seas|website=eartharchives.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another fairly large eugenedont is Parahelicoprion. The specimens suggest an animal that grew to the same size ({{cvt|12|m|ft|disp=sqbr}}), but was much less slender and overall less heavy.&lt;ref&gt;http://img06.deviantart.net/8207/i/2015/143/8/e/parahelicoprion_clerci_by_teratophoneus-d8uf4rh.png&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Hybodontiform ([[Hybodontiformes]]) ====
The largest-known hydontiformid is ''[[Ptychodus]]'', which was about {{cvt|32|ft|order=flip}} long.

=== Placoderms ([[Placodermi]]) ===
The largest-known [[placoderm]] was the {{cvt|6|m}} long ''[[Dunkleosteus]]''. It is estimated to have weighed around {{cvt|3.6|tonne|ST}}. Its relative, ''[[Titanichthys]]'', may have rivaled it in size.

== Arthropods ([[Arthropoda]]) ==

=== [[Dinocaridida]] ===

==== Radiodont ([[Radiodonta]]) ====
The largest-known is ''[[Aegirocassis]]'' at least {{cvt|7|ft|order=flip}} long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2015/03/11/us-science-creature-idINKBN0M725O20150311|title=Gigantic ancient arthropod was really 'a very peaceful guy'|first=Reuters|last=Editorial|website=reuters.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== [[Chelicerata]] ===

==== Eurypterids ([[Eurypterida]]) ====
The largest-known in this group was ''[[Jaekelopterus rhenaniae]]'' at {{cvt|2.5|m}} in length. A close contender was ''[[Pterygotus]]'' at {{cvt|2.3|m}} in length.

==== Arachnids ([[Arachnida]]) ====
There are two contenders for largest-known ever [[arachnid]]: ''[[Pulmonoscorpius kirktonensis]]'' and ''[[Brontoscorpio|Brontoscorpio anglicus]]''. Pulmonoscorpius was {{cvt|70|cm}} Brontoscorpio was {{cvt|90|cm}}. The biggest difference is that ''Brontoscorpio'' was aquatic, and ''Pulmonoscorpius'' was terrestrial. ''Brontoscorpio'' is not to be confused with various [[Eurypterids]]: it was a true scorpion with a venomous stinger.

=== [[Myriapoda]] ===
The largest-known myriapod by far was the giant ''[[Arthropleura]]''. Measuring {{cvt|2.5|m}} and {{cvt|45|cm}} wide, it was the largest-known terrestrial [[arthropod]] of all time. Like its modern-day relatives, Arthropleura would have likely sprayed hydrogen cyanide at potential predators, although its sheer size and tough exoskeleton protected it from attack.

=== Trilobitomorpha ===

==== Trilobites ([[Trilobita]]) ====
Some of these extinct marine arthropods exceeded {{cvt|60|cm}} in length. A nearly complete specimen of ''[[Isotelus|Isotelus rex]]'' from [[Manitoba]] attained a length over {{cvt|70|cm}}, and an ''[[Ogyginus forteyi]]'' from Portugal was almost as long. Fragments of trilobites suggest even larger record sizes. An isolated [[pygidium]] of ''[[Hungioides bohemicus]]'' implies that the full animal was {{cvt|90|cm}} long.&lt;ref name="Hungioides"&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Gutiérrez-Marco| first1 = Juan C. | last2 = Sá | first2 = Artur A. | last3 = Garcia-Bellido | first3 = Diego C. | last4 = Rabano | first4 = Isabel | last5 = Valério | first5 = Manuel | title = Giant Trilobites and Trilobite Clusters from the Ordovician of Portugal | journal = Geology | volume = 37 | pages = 443–446 | year = 2009 | doi = 10.1130/G25513A.1| bibcode = 2009Geo....37..443G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Insects ([[Insecta]]) ===

==== Sawflies, wasps, bees, ants and allies ([[Hymenoptera]]) ====
The largest-known of this group was the giant ant ''[[Titanomyrma|Titanomyrma giganteum]]'' at {{cvt|3|cm}}, with [[Eusociality|queens]] growing to {{cvt|6|cm}}. It had a wingspan of {{cvt|15|cm}}.&lt;ref name="Messel"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Messel|author=Schaal, Stephan|date=27 January 2006|work=|publisher=|doi=10.1038/npg.els.0004143|journal=eLS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Protodonata ====
The largest-known in this group was probably ''[[Meganeura]]'' with a wingspan of {{cvt|75|cm}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Biomarker Guide: Biomarkers and Isotopes in Petroleum Systems and Earth History |work=Google Books |date= 2005 |page=1107 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qk8anEDZykwC&amp;pg=PA731&amp;lpg=PA731&amp;dq=meganeura+75+cm&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=EV-f6TwRxZ&amp;sig=JQy_hAaI37ZyC0UMh69AcKv-bIA&amp;hl=hu&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qRKVVe_XAqPjywO_7I_wBA&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwBjg8#v=onepage&amp;q=meganeura%2075%20cm&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another enormous and possibly larger species was ''[[Meganeuropsis permiana]]''.

==== Siphonaptera ====
The largest-known in this group was probably ''[[Saurophthirus]]'', growing to {{cvt|1|in|order=flip}} in length. It possibly sucked the [[blood]] of [[pterosaur]]s.

==== Palaeodictyoptera ====
The largest-known insect of this order was ''[[Mazothairos]]'', with a wingspan of up to {{cvt|22|in|order=flip}}.

== Molluscs ([[Mollusca]]) ==
[[File:Campanile giganteum.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Campanile giganteum]]'' shell]]

=== Gastropods ([[Gastropoda]]) ===

==== Snails and slugs ([[Gastropoda]]) ====
The largest-known of this group were in the genus ''[[Campanile (gastropod)|Campanile]]'', with the extinct ''[[Campanile giganteum]]'' having shell lengths up to {{cvt|90|cm}}.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.e-periodica.ch/cntmng?pid=egh-001:1987:80::1248&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bivalves ([[Bivalvia]]) ===

==== Bivalves ([[Bivalvia]]) ====
The largest-known [[bivalve]] ever was ''[[Platyceramus platinus]]'', a giant that usually had an axial length of {{cvt|1|m}}, but some individuals could reach an axial length of up to {{cvt|3|m}}.

=== Cephalopods ([[Cephalopoda]]) ===
{{Main|Cephalopod size}}
[[File:Parapuzosia seppenradensis cast.jpg|thumb|''[[Parapuzosia seppenradensis]]'' shell]]

==== Ammonites ([[Ammonoidea]]) ====
The largest-known ammonite was ''[[Parapuzosia seppenradensis]]''. A partial fossil specimen found in [[Germany]] had a shell diameter of {{cvt|1.95|m}}, but the [[living chamber]] was incomplete, so the estimated shell diameter was probably about {{cvt|2.55|m}} when it was alive.

==== Belemnites ([[Belemnoidea]]) ====
The largest-known belemnite was ''[[Megateuthis gigantea]]'' with a guard of {{cvt|46|cm}} in length and an estimated total length {{cvt|3|m}} long.

==== Nautiloids ([[Nautiloidea]]) ====
The longest- and largest-known of this group was ''[[Cameroceras]]'' with a shell length of {{cvt|9|m}}.&lt;ref name="TandK"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Teichert C|author2=B Kummel |year= 1960|title=Size of Endocerid Cephalopods|journal=Breviora Mus. Comp. Zool.|volume=128|pages=1–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Neocoleoidea ====
Both ''[[Tusoteuthis]]'' and ''[[Yezoteuthis]]'' are estimated to be similar in size to the modern-day [[giant squid]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tonmo.com/science/fossils/cretaceousGS.php{{full citation needed|date=July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Leonard Duncan Albert Hussey''', [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire|OBE]] (6 June 1891 – 25 February 1964) was an English [[meteorologist]], [[archaeologist]], [[explorer]], [[medical doctor]] and member of [[Ernest Shackleton]]'s [[Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition|Imperial Trans-Antarctic]] and [[Shackleton–Rowett Expedition]]s. During the latter, he was with Shackleton at his death, and transported the body part-way back to England.

Hussey was also a member of the [[British armed forces|armed forces]] during [[World War I]], serving in [[France]] and with Shackleton in [[Russia]]. After returning to private practice, Hussey rejoined the war effort in 1940 and became a decorated medical officer with the [[Royal Air Force]] during the [[Second World War]]. Returning once again to civilian practice in 1946, he was a member of the [[Royal College of Physicians]], a lecturer, [[author]], and [[The Scout Association|Boy Scouts]] leader prior to retirement. Many of the items he collected during his career were donated to a number of museums.

==Early life==

Hussey was born to James and Eliza Hussey ([[née]] Aitken) in Norman House, Norman Road in Leytonestone, in London. He was the sixth child of the family, and the only son to his father, a machine ruler at the local stationery printing factory.&lt;ref name="cool" /&gt; By 1900, the family resided at 342 Kingsland Road in Leytonestone with three further children,&lt;ref name="cool"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coolantarctica.com/Antarctica%20fact%20file/History/biography/hussey_leonard.htm|time = (1891–1964) – Biographical notes|publisher=Cool Antarctica|accessdate=7 April 2009|year = 1891|title = Leonard Duncan Albert Hussey (1891-1964) - Biographical notes}}&lt;/ref&gt; leaving Hussey one of eleven children; the eldest of four boys – the others being James, William and Percy – alongside five daughters, Maude, Beatrice, May, Blanche and Daisy.&lt;ref name="endbio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitandlearn.co.uk/TopicalFactfiles/EnduranceObituaries/LeonardHussey/tabid/124/Default.aspx |title=Leonard Duncan Albert hussey – Biography |publisher=Endurance Project |accessdate=15 April 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080205083605/http://www.visitandlearn.co.uk/TopicalFactfiles/EnduranceObituaries/LeonardHussey/tabid/124/Default.aspx |archivedate=5 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hussey attended [[Strand School]] and Hackney P.T. Centre.&lt;ref name="obit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enduranceobituaries.co.uk/hussey.htm|title=The Endurance Obituaries – Leonard Duncan Albert Hussey|author=J. F. Mann|accessdate=20 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 October 1909, Hussey entered the [[University of London]], taking as course in [[psychology]] and gaining a [[bachelor of science]] second class at [[King's College London]], as well as degrees in meteorology and [[anthropology]].&lt;ref name="cool" /&gt;&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt;

==Career==

===Sudan and Shackleton===
[[File:Shackletonhead.jpg|thumb|left|"He called for me, looked me up and down, walked up and down when he was talking to me, didn't seem to take any notice. Finally he said, 'Yes, I like you, I'll take you.' He told me afterwards he took me because he thought I looked funny!" – Hussey on his acceptance by Shackleton (pictured) for his Antarctic expedition.&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt;]]

From 1913, Hussey had undertaken employment as an anthropologist and [[archaeologist]] at a dig in [[Jebel Moya]],&lt;ref name="h402"&gt;Huntford, p. 402.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sudan]] as part of [[Henry Wellcome]]'s Expedition.&lt;ref name="pbs"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/shackletonexped/1914/t_hussey.html|title=Leonard Hussey – Meteorologist|publisher=PBS|accessdate=7 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside [[O. G. S. Crawford]], Hussey worked on a monthly pay of £8.&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt; While in the Sudan, he read in a month-old newspaper about Shackleton's intention to embark on an Antarctic Expedition, and 'The idea gripped me'. He wrote to Shackleton expressing his interest in joining the project.&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt; Shackleton replied telling Hussey to call on him when he returned to London. 'My luck in this respect was later explained to me by Shackleton, who said he was greatly amused to find amongst nearly five thousand applications to join the expedition, one that came from the heart of Africa.'&lt;ref name="Hussey"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hussey|first=Dr L. D. A. |title=South with Shackleton|publisher=Sampson Low|location=London|year=1949}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shackleton agreed to select him for the expedition, later telling him that he did so because he "looked funny".&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hussey"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hussey|first=Dr L. D. A. |title=South with Shackleton|publisher=Sampson Low|location=London|year=1949}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition 1914–17===

[[File:Hussey-left,-james-right.jpg|thumb|right| Reginald James, sitting on the left, working during the expedition. He is examining a [[Dimes anemometer]] while Leonard Hussey works on the right.&lt;ref name="cool"/&gt;]]
Hussey joined the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition of 1914–1917's Weddell Sea party as a meteorologist,&lt;ref name="s136"&gt;Stonehouse, p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hussey"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hussey|first=Dr L.

Often we would combine to provoke him just for the pleasure of hearing his clever retorts and invariably he would emerge the victor, no matter how many of us tried to best him."&lt;ref&gt;Perkins, Holtman, Kessler and McCarthy, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 June 1915, Hussey and the crew staged a four-hour "smoking concert" and costume party, during which Hussey dressed as a black [[minstrel]].&lt;ref name="cornwall"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nmmc.co.uk/index.php?page=Collections&amp;type=&amp;id=191&amp;choiceid=90|title=Leonard Hussey's banjo|publisher=National Maritime Museum Cornwall|accessdate=15 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roland Huntford recorded in ''Shackleton'' of Hussey's tendency to be "determinedly cheery to the point of egregiousness".&lt;ref name="h402"/&gt;

The instrument, weighing twelve pounds, was rescued from the wreck of the ''[[Endurance (1912 ship)|Endurance]]'' as "vital mental medicine" by Shackleton, who made an exception of his instructions that each person could take only 2 pounds in weight of personal belongings, so that it could be saved.&lt;ref name="cornwall"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hussey"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hussey|first=Dr L.

===World War I===
Hussey initially joined the London University contingent of the [[Officers' Training Corps]], and was commissioned as a [[second lieutenant]] in the cadets on 13 November 1912.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=28662|page=8288|date=12 November 1912}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hussey progressed to the full armed forces in the later years of the First World War,&lt;ref name="s136"/&gt; and was commissioned as a temporary second lieutenant in the [[Royal Garrison Artillery]] on 19 January 1917,&lt;ref name="endbio"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=29908|supp=y|page=733|date=16 January 1917}}&lt;/ref&gt; serving in France, as well as operating with Shackleton on operations at [[Murmansk]] in northern Russia as part of the [[Polar Bear Expedition]].&lt;ref name="endbio"/&gt;&lt;ref name= Huntford661&gt;Huntford, p. 661.&lt;/ref&gt; He was promoted to temporary lieutenant on 19 July 1918,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=30851|supp=y|page=9678|date=16 August 1918}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to the temporary rank of captain on 8 October.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=30956|supp=y|page=12222|date=15 October 1918}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hussey was demobilised on 14 May 1919, retaining the rank of captain.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=32266|supp=y|page=2371|date=22 March 1921}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hussey was asked by [[Frank Wild]], following Shackleton's death in harbour in [[South Georgia Island|South Georgia]], to escort the body to England while Wild himself assumed command of the ''Quest''. Hussey arrived in [[South America]] and [[Submarine telecommunications cable|cabled]] England with news of the explorer's passing.  Shackleton's widow responded that the explorer should be buried at [[Grytviken]] in [[South Georgia Island|South Georgia]], and Hussey carried out these instructions.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hussey"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hussey|first=Dr L.

===Medical career in London===

Following his return to England, Hussey practised medicine in London until 1940.&lt;ref name="s136"/&gt; He had become a member of the Royal College of Surgeons and a Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians, while residing at 328 Clapham Road, in London.&lt;ref name="endbio"/&gt;

===World War II===
Hussey joined the RAF as a medical officer during the Second World War, with the rank of [[flight lieutenant]] and the serial number 87314.&lt;ref name="s136"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gaz1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gaz1"&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=34996|supp=y|page=6642|date=19 November 1940}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served in [[Iceland]] as First Senior Medical Officer in the temporary rank of [[squadron leader]], to which he was promoted on 1 July 1943 and then at [[RAF Benson]] in Oxfordshire.&lt;ref name="endbio"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=36092|supp=y|page=3211|date=13 July 1943}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was [[Mentioned in Despatches]] on two occasions in 1945, on 1 January and 14 May.&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt; Appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 1946 New Year Honours,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=37407|supp=y|page=38|date=28 December 1945}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hussey retained his links to the RAF for a time after the end of the war, serving in the [[Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve]] as a squadron leader, until his retirement on 10 February 1954.&lt;ref&gt;Ingersoll, p . 22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=40226|supp=y|page=4018|date=6 July 1954}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later career===
Following the end of the war, Hussey resumed his medical practice,&lt;ref name="s136"/&gt; operating as a GP in [[Hertfordshire]] up until 1957.&lt;ref name="endbio"/&gt; He was appointed [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] (OBE) in the [[1946 New Year Honours]] for his war service,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=37407|page=38|date=28 December 1945}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1949 he served on the SS ''Clan Macauley'' as a ship's surgeon, sailing from England to [[South Africa]] and [[Australia]]. He also published his account of the Trans-Antarctic expedition entitled ''South with Endurance''.&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt; By 1957, having retired from his practice, Hussey became President of the Antarctic Club.&lt;ref name="endbio"/&gt; A Shackleton-Hussey trophy was created and awarded by Hussey to several scout movements from the 1960s, including the Chorleywood Scout pack, of which Hussey was the at one time the President of as part of his growing involvement in the [[scout movement]] following his retirement.&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt;

===Death===
In 1960, Hussey retired to [[Worthing]], and was forced to curtail his lecturing career due to poor health. His notes and lantern slides were donated to Ralph Gullett, a local scout leader and friend, who took over his lecturing. His banjo, which he took along with him on expeditions and later had on display at his practice,&lt;ref name="endbio"/&gt; was signed by all the members of ''Endurance'',&lt;ref name="cornwall"/&gt; and donated to the [[National Maritime Museum]] and was valued in 2004 at over [[£]]150,000.&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt; Hussey died in London in 1964 at the age of 72,&lt;ref&gt;Whitehead, p. 545.&lt;/ref&gt; and was survived by his wife, who died in 1980. The couple had no children,&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt; and his estate was passed to his housekeeper, Margaret Mock, until her own death in 1999.&lt;ref name="endbio"/&gt;

==Published works and decorations==
Hussey published a number of works throughout his life, including editing the records of both of Shackleton's expeditions,&lt;ref name="cool"/&gt; and a number of articles in partnership with other expedition members.&lt;ref name="endbio"/&gt;

'''Lepersonnite-(Gd)''' is a very rare [[rare-earth element|rare-earth]] and [[uranium]] mineral with the formula Ca(Gd,Dy)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;(SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;·48H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. It occurs associated with [[bijvoetite-(Y)]] in the [[Shinkolobwe]] deposit in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], famous for rare uranium minerals. Lepersonnite-(Gd) is unique in being the only confirmed mineral with essential [[gadolinium]].&lt;ref name=CanMin&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mindat&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gadolinium: The mineralogy of gadolinium - Mindat. org [http://www.mindat.org/element/Gadolinium]&lt;/reF&gt;

'''Schedule 1 substances''', in the sense of the [[Chemical Weapons Convention]], are chemicals which can either be used as chemical weapons themselves or used in the manufacture of chemical weapons and which have no, or very limited, uses outside of chemical warfare.

These may be produced or used for research, medical, pharmaceutical or chemical weapon defence testing (called "protective testing" in the treaty) purposes but production above 100 grams per year must be declared to the [[OPCW]] in accordance with Part VI of the "Verification Annex". A country is limited to possessing a maximum of one tonne of these materials.

They are sub-divided into Part A substances, which are chemicals that can be used directly as weapons, and Part B which are precursors useful in the manufacture of chemical weapons. Examples are [[sulfur mustard|mustard]] and [[nerve agent|nerve]] agents, and substances which are solely used as precursor chemicals in their manufacture. A few of these chemicals have very small-scale non-military applications; for example, minute quantities of [[nitrogen mustard]] are used to treat certain [[cancer]]s.

Chemicals which can be used as weapons, or used in their manufacture, but which have legitimate applications as well are listed in [[List of Schedule 2 substances (CWC)|Schedule 2]] (small-scale applications) and [[List of Schedule 3 substances (CWC)|Schedule 3]] (large-scale applications).

== Guidelines for Schedule 1 ==
[[Image:CWC schedule 1 phosphonofluoridates.png|thumb|x150px|Schedule 1 phosphonofluoridates; where R1 = (cyclo)alkyl with C&lt;C&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; and R2 = [[Methyl|Me]], [[Ethyl group|Et]], [[isopropyl|i-Pr]] or n-Pr.]]
The following criteria shall be taken into account in considering whether a toxic chemical or precursor should be included in Schedule 1:
*It has been developed, produced, stockpiled or used as a chemical weapon as defined in Article II;
*It poses otherwise a high risk to the object and purpose of this Convention by virtue of its high potential for use in activities prohibited under this Convention because one or more of the following conditions are met:
**It possesses a chemical structure closely related to that of other toxic chemicals listed in Schedule 1, and has, or can be expected to have, comparable properties;
**It possesses such lethal or incapacitating toxicity as well as other properties that would enable it to be used as a chemical weapon;
**It may be used as a precursor in the final single technological stage of production of a toxic chemical listed in Schedule 1, regardless of whether this stage takes place in facilities, in munitions or elsewhere;
*It has little or no use for purposes not prohibited under this Convention.

== Toxic chemicals ==
*O-Alkyl (&lt;C&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;, incl. cycloalkyl) alkyl (Me, Et, n-Pr or i-Pr)-phosphonofluoridates, ''e.g.''

{{Forms of government}}

This is a list of [[countries]] by [[system of government]]. There is also a [[Map|political mapping]] of the world that shows what form of government each country has, as well as a brief description of what each form of government entails. The list is colour-coded according to the type of government, for example: blue represents a republic with an executive head of state, and pink is a constitutional monarchy with a ceremonial head of state. The colour-coding also appears on the following map, representing the same government categories. The [[#Legend|legend]] of what the different colours represent is found just below the map.

==Systems of governance==
''Italics'' indicate states with limited recognition.

===Presidential systems===
These are systems in which a [[president]] is the active head of the [[executive branch]] of government, and is elected and remains in office independently of the [[legislature]].

In full [[presidential system]]s, the president is both head of state and head of government. There is generally no prime minister, although if one exists, in most cases, he or she serves purely at the discretion of the president (with the exceptions being Belarus and Kazakhstan, where the prime minister is effectively the head of government).&lt;ref name="BL"&gt;[https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Belarus_2004?lang=en Constitution of Belarus from 1994 (rev. 2004)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KZ"&gt;{{cite news |title=Nazarbaev Signs Kazakh Constitutional Amendments Into Law |url=http://www.rferl.org/a/kazakhstan-nazarbaev-signs-constitutional-amendments/28361743.html |publisher=[[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]] |date=10 March 2017 |access-date=10 March 2017}} For more information: please see {{cite news |last1=Abdurasulov |first1=Abdujalil |title=Kazakhstan constitution: Will changes bring democracy? |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-39177708 |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=6 March 2017 |access-date=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Candidates for both the Assembly of Experts and the presidency are vetted by the appointed [[Guardian Council]].&lt;/ref&gt;'''''

===Semi-presidential systems===
In [[semi-presidential system]]s, there is always both a president and a prime minister. In such systems, the president has genuine executive authority, unlike in a parliamentary republic, but the role of a head of government may be exercised by the [[prime minister]].

==== Premier-presidential systems====
The president chooses the prime minister and cabinet, but only the parliament may remove them from office with a ''vote of no confidence''. The president does ''not'' have the right to dismiss the prime minister or the cabinet.{{colbegin}}

{{colend}}

==== President-parliamentary systems====
The president chooses the prime minister without the [[confidence vote]] from the parliament, and the cabinet but must have the support of the parliament majority for his choice. In order to remove a prime minister or the whole cabinet from power, the president can dismiss them or the assembly can remove them by a ''vote of no confidence''.

===Parliamentary systems===
A [[parliamentary republic]] is a system in which a [[prime minister]] is the active head of the [[executive branch]] of government and also leader of the [[legislature]]. The president's degree of executive power may range from being significant (e.g. South Africa), to little (e.g. India), to only having certain limited reserve powers (e.g. Ireland) or none at all (e.g. Germany). Where the president holds little executive power, his or her function is primarily that of a symbolic [[figurehead]].

==== Full parliamentary republican systems====

*{{flag|Finland}}&lt;ref&gt;Formerly a semi-presidential republic, it is now a parliamentary republic according to David Arter, First Chair of Politics at Aberdeen University, who in his "Scandinavian Politics Today" (Manchester University Press, revised 2008 {{ISBN|9780719078538}}), he quotes {{Cite journal | last = Nousiainen | first = Jaakko | title = From semi-presidentialism to parliamentary government: political and constitutional developments in Finland | journal = [[Scandinavian Political Studies]] | volume = 24 | issue = 2 | pages = 95–109 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/1467-9477.00048 | date = June 2001 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1467-9477.00048 | ref = harv }} as follows: "There are hardly any grounds for the epithet 'semi-presidential'." Arter's own conclusions are only slightly more nuanced: "The adoption of a new constitution on 1 March 2000 meant that Finland was no longer a case of semi-presidential government other than in the minimalist sense of a situation where a popularly elected fixed-term president exists alongside a prime minister and cabinet who are responsible to parliament (Elgie 2004: 317)". According to the Finnish Constitution, the President has no possibility to rule the government without the ministerial approval, and substantially has not the power to disband the parliament under its own desire. Finland is actually represented by its Prime Minister, and not by its President, in the Council of the Heads of State and Government of the European Union. The 2012 constitutional amendments reduced the powers of the President even further.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mixed parliamentary republican systems====
A combined head of state and government is elected by the legislature in the form of an [[executive president]], however they are not subject to parliamentary confidence during their term (although their cabinet may be); the exceptions are [[South Africa]], where the president may be forced to resign by the Parliament's will,&lt;ref name="Constitution of South Africa"&gt;{{cite web|title=Constitution of South Africa|url=https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/South_Africa_2012?lang=en|website=Constitute|access-date=13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kiribati]], where the president is popularly elected and a successful parliamentary motion of no confidence automatically triggers a new presidential election.

====Directorial republican systems====
In the [[directorial system]] a council jointly exercises both state functions and governmental powers (the council is the collective head of state and government). The council is elected by the parliament, but it is not subject to [[Confidence (political science)|political confidence]] during its term which has a fixed duration.

{{colend}}

===Constitutional monarchies===
These are systems in which the [[head of state]] is a [[constitutional monarch]]; the existence of their office and their ability to exercise their authority is established and restrained or held back by constitutional law.

====Constitutional monarchies with ceremonial monarchs====
Systems in which a [[prime minister]] is the active head of the [[executive branch]] of government. In some cases the prime minister is also leader of the [[legislature]], in other cases the executive branch is clearly separated from legislature although the entire cabinet or individual ministers must step down in the case of a [[vote of no confidence]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stortinget.no/no/In-English/About-the-Storting/The-Constitution/ Norwegian Parliament web page]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/no.html#Govt CIA factbook on Norway]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dubious|Constitutional monarchy|date=November 2008}} The [[head of state]] is a [[constitutional monarch]] who normally only exercises his or her powers with the consent of the government, the people or their representatives.

{{Main article|Confederation}}A union of sovereign states, united for purposes of common action often in relation to other states.

==European Union==
{{main article|List of European Union member states by political system}}

The exact political character of the [[European Union]] is debated, some arguing that it is ''[[sui generis]]'' (unique), but others arguing that it has features of a [[federation]] or a [[confederation]]. It has elements of [[intergovernmentalism]], with the [[European Council]] acting as its collective "president", and also elements of [[supranationalism]], with the [[European Commission]] acting as its executive and bureaucracy.&lt;ref&gt;For more detailed discussion, see John McCormick, ''European Union Politics'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2011), Chapters 1 and 2.&lt;/ref&gt; But it is not easily placed in any of the above categories.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}

A list of active and extinct '''[[submarine volcano]]es''' and '''[[seamount]]s''' located under the world's oceans. There are estimated to be 40,000 to 55,000 seamounts in the global oceans.&lt;ref name="Census"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kim|first1=Seung-Sep|last2=Wessel|first2=Paul|title=New global seamount census from altimetry-derived gravity data|journal=Geophysical Journal International|date=2011|volume=186|issue=2|doi=10.1111/j.1365-246X.2011.05076.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost all are not well-mapped and many may not have been identified at all. Most are unnamed and unexplored. This list is therefore confined to seamounts that are notable enough to have been named and/or explored.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42349">In [[economics]], utility is the satisfaction or benefit derived by consuming a product; thus the '''marginal utility''' of a [[Good (economics)|good]] or [[Service (economics)|service]] is the change in the utility from an increase in the [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] of that good or service. 

In the context of [[cardinal utility]], economists sometimes speak of a '''law of diminishing marginal utility''', meaning that the first [[units of measurement|unit]] of consumption of a good or service yields more utility than the second and subsequent units, with a continuing reduction for greater amounts. Therefore, the fall in marginal utility as consumption increases is known as diminishing marginal utility. Mathematically:
:MU&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&gt;MU&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&gt;MU&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;......&gt;MU&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;

== Marginality ==
The term ''marginal'' refers to a small change, starting from some baseline level. As [[Philip Wicksteed]] explained the term,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Marginal considerations are considerations which concern a slight increase or diminution of the stock of anything which we possess or are considering&lt;ref&gt;[[Philip Wicksteed|Wicksteed, Philip Henry]]; ''The Common Sense of Political Economy'' (1910), Bk I Ch 2 and elsewhere.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Frequently the marginal change is assumed to start from the [[Capital (economics)#Endowment|endowment]], meaning the total resources available for consumption (see [[Budget constraint]]). This endowment is determined by many things including physical laws (which constrain how forms of energy and matter may be transformed), accidents of nature (which determine the presence of natural resources), and the outcomes of past decisions made by the individual himself or herself and by others.

For reasons of tractability, it is often assumed in [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical analysis]] that goods and services are [[Continuum (theory)|continuously divisible]]. Under this assumption, [[marginal concepts]], including marginal utility, may be expressed in terms of [[differential calculus]]. Marginal utility can then be defined as the first derivative of total utility—the total satisfaction obtained from consumption of a good or service—with respect to the amount of consumption of that good or service.

In practice the smallest relevant division may be quite large. Sometimes economic analysis concerns the marginal values associated with a change of one unit of a discrete good or service, such as a motor vehicle or a haircut. For a motor vehicle, the total number of motor vehicles produced is large enough for a continuous assumption to be reasonable: this may not be true for, say, an aircraft carrier.

== Utility ==
{{Main|Utility}}
Depending on which theory of ''utility'' is used, the interpretation of marginal utility can be meaningful or not. Economists have commonly described utility as if it were ''quantifiable'', that is, as if different levels of utility could be compared along a numerical scale.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Stigler|Stigler, George Joseph]]; ''The Development of Utility Theory'', I and II, ''Journal of Political Economy'' (1950), issues 3 and 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[George Stigler|Stigler, George Joseph]]; ''The Adoption of Marginal Utility Theory'', ''History of Political Economy'' (1972).&lt;/ref&gt; This has affected the development and reception of theories of marginal utility. Quantitative concepts of utility allow familiar arithmetic operations, and further assumptions of continuity and differentiability greatly increase tractability.

Contemporary mainstream economic theory frequently defers metaphysical questions, and merely notes or assumes that preference structures conforming to certain rules can be usefully ''proxied'' by associating goods, services, or their uses with quantities, and ''defines'' "utility" as such a quantification.&lt;ref&gt;[[David M. Kreps|Kreps, David Marc]]; ''A Course in Microeconomic Theory'', Chapter two: ''The theory of consumer choice and demand'', ''Utility representations''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another conception is [[Utilitarianism|Benthamite philosophy]], which equated usefulness with the production of pleasure and avoidance of pain,&lt;ref&gt;[[Jeremy Bentham|Bentham, Jeremy]]; ''Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation'', Chapter I §I–III.&lt;/ref&gt; assumed subject to arithmetic operation.&lt;ref&gt;Bentham, Jeremy; ''Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation'', Chapter IV.&lt;/ref&gt; British economists, under the influence of this philosophy (especially by way of [[John Stuart Mill]]), viewed utility as "the feelings of pleasure and pain"&lt;ref&gt;Jevons, William Stanley; “Brief Account of a General Mathematical Theory of Political Economy”, ''[[Journal of the Royal Statistical Society]]'' v29 (June 1866) §2.&lt;/ref&gt; and further as a "''quantity'' of feeling" (emphasis added).&lt;ref&gt;Jevons, William Stanley; ''Brief Account of a General Mathematical Theory of Political Economy'', ''Journal of the Royal Statistical Society'' v29 (June 1866) §4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though generally pursued outside of the mainstream methods, there are conceptions of utility that do not rely on quantification.
For example, the [[Austrian school]] generally attributes value to ''the satisfaction of wants'',&lt;ref&gt;Menger, Carl; ''Grundsätze der Volkswirtschaftslehre'' (''Principles of Economics'') Chapter 2 §2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mc_culloch" /&gt;&lt;ref name="georgescu-rogen"&gt;[[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen|Georgescu-Roegen, Nicholas]]; ''Utility'', ''International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences'' (1968).&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes rejects even the ''possibility'' of quantification.&lt;ref name="mises" &gt;[[Ludwig von Mises|von Mises, Ludwig Heinrich]]; ''Theorie des Geldes und der Umlaufsmittel'' (1912).&lt;/ref&gt;
It has been argued that the Austrian framework makes it possible to consider rational preferences that would otherwise be excluded.&lt;ref name="mc_culloch"&gt;Mc Culloch, James Huston; [https://www.mises.org/etexts/mcCulloch.pdf “The Austrian Theory of the Marginal Use and of Ordinal Marginal Utility”,] ''Zeitschrift für Nationalökonomie'' 37 (1977) #3&amp;amp;4 (September).&lt;/ref&gt;

In any standard framework, the same object may have different marginal utilities for different people, reflecting different preferences or individual circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Davenport, Herbert Joseph; ''The Economics of Enterprise'' (1913) Ch VII, pp. 86–87.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept in cardinal utility theory that marginal utilities diminish across the ranges relevant to decision-making is called the "law of diminishing marginal utility" (and is also known as [[Hermann Heinrich Gossen|Gossen]]'s [[Gossen's laws|First Law]]). This refers to the increase in utility an individual gains from increasing their consumption of a particular good. "The law of diminishing marginal utility is at the heart of the explanation of numerous economic phenomena, including [[time preference]] and the [[Value (economics)|value of goods]] ... The law says, first, that the marginal utility of each homogenous unit decreases as the supply of units increases (and vice versa); second, that the marginal utility of a larger-sized unit is greater than the marginal utility of a smaller-sized unit (and vice versa). The first law denotes the law of diminishing marginal utility, the second law denotes the law of increasing total utility."&lt;ref name=Mises/&gt;

In modern economics, choice under conditions of certainty at a single point in time  is modeled via [[ordinal utility]], in which the numbers assigned to the utility of a particular circumstance of the individual have no meaning by themselves, but which of two alternative circumstances has higher utility ''is'' meaningful. With ordinal utility, a person's preferences have no unique marginal utility, and thus whether or not marginal utility is diminishing is not meaningful. In contrast, the concept of diminishing marginal utility is meaningful in the context of [[cardinal utility]], which in modern economics is used in analyzing [[intertemporal choice]], [[expected utility hypothesis|choice under uncertainty]], and [[social welfare function|social welfare]].

The law of diminishing marginal utility is similar to the law of [[diminishing returns]] which states that as the amount of one [[Factors of production|factor of production]] increases as all other factors of production are held the same, the marginal return (extra output gained by adding an extra unit) decreases.

As the rate of commodity acquisition increases, ''marginal'' utility decreases. If commodity consumption continues to rise, marginal utility at some point may fall to '''zero''', reaching '''maximum''' total utility. Further increase in consumption of units of commodities causes marginal utility to become '''negative'''; this signifies '''dissatisfaction'''. For example,
* beyond some point, further doses of antibiotics would kill no pathogens at all, and might even become harmful to the body.
* to satiate thirst a person drinks water but beyond a point, consumption of more water might make the person vomit, hence leading to negative marginal and thus diminished total utility
* it takes a certain amount of food energy to sustain a population, yet beyond a point, more calories cannot be consumed and are simply discarded (or cause disease).

Diminishing marginal utility is traditionally a microeconomic concept and often holds for an individual, although the marginal utility of a good or service might be ''increasing'' as well. For example:
* bed sheets, which up to some number may only provide warmth, but after that point may be useful to allow one to effect an escape by being tied together into a rope;
* tickets, for travel or theatre, where a second ticket might allow one to take a date on an otherwise uninteresting outing;
* dosages of antibiotics, where having too few pills would leave bacteria with greater resistance, but a full supply could effect a cure.
* the third leg is more useful than the first two when building a chair.

As suggested elsewhere in this article, occasionally one may come across a situation in which marginal utility increases even at a macroeconomic level. For example, the provision of a service may only be viable if it accessible to most or all of the population, and the marginal utility of a raw material required to provide such a service will increase at the "tipping point" at which this occurs. This is similar to the position with very large items such as aircraft carriers: the numbers of these items involved are so small that marginal utility is no longer a helpful concept, as there is merely a simple "yes" or "no" decision.

== Marginalist theory ==
[[Marginalism]] explains choice with the hypothesis that people decide whether to effect any given change based on the marginal utility of that change, with rival alternatives being chosen based upon which has the greatest marginal utility.

=== Market price and diminishing marginal utility ===
If an individual possesses a good or service whose marginal utility to him is less than that of some other good or service for which he could trade it, then it is in his interest to effect that trade. Of course, as one thing is sold and another is bought, the respective marginal gains or losses from further trades will change. If the marginal utility of one thing is diminishing, and the other is not increasing, all else being equal, an individual will demand an increasing ratio of that which is acquired to that which is sacrificed. (One important way in which all else might not be equal is when the use of the one good or service complements that of the other. In such cases, exchange ratios might be constant.&lt;ref name="mc_culloch" /&gt;) If any trader can better his position by offering a trade more favorable to complementary traders, then he will do so.

In an economy with [[money]], the marginal utility of a quantity is simply that of the best good or service that it could purchase. In this way it is useful for explaining [[supply and demand]], as well as essential aspects of models of [[imperfect competition]].

==== The paradox of water and diamonds ====
{{Main|Paradox of value}}
The "paradox of water and diamonds", usually most commonly associated with [[Adam Smith]],&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Adam; ''An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations'' (1776) Chapter IV. "Of the Origin and Use of Money"&lt;/ref&gt; though recognized by earlier thinkers,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first = Scott|last = Gordon|year = 1991|title = History and Philosophy of Social Science: An Introduction|chapter = The Scottish Enlightenment of the eighteenth century|publisher = [[Routledge]]|isbn = 0-415-09670-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the apparent contradiction that water possesses a value far lower than diamonds, even though water is far more vital to a human being.

Price is determined by both marginal utility and marginal cost, and here the key to the "paradox" is that the marginal cost of water is far lower than that of diamonds.

That is not to say that the price of any good or service is simply a function of the marginal utility that it has for any one individual nor for some ostensibly typical individual. Rather, individuals are willing to trade based upon the respective marginal utilities of the goods that they have or desire (with these marginal utilities being distinct for each potential trader), and prices thus develop constrained by these marginal utilities.

== Quantified marginal utility ==
Under the [[special case]] in which usefulness can be quantified, the change in utility of moving from state &lt;math&gt;S_1&lt;/math&gt; to state &lt;math&gt;S_2&lt;/math&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta U=U(S_2)-U(S_1)\,&lt;/math&gt;
Moreover, if &lt;math&gt;S_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_2&lt;/math&gt; are distinguishable by values of just one variable &lt;math&gt;g\,&lt;/math&gt; which is itself quantified, then it becomes possible to speak of the ratio of the marginal utility of the change in &lt;math&gt;g\,&lt;/math&gt; to the size of that change:
[[Image:UtilityQuantified.svg|thumb|right|400px|Diminishing marginal utility, given quantification]]
:&lt;math&gt;\left.\frac{\Delta U}{\Delta g}\right|_{c.p.}&lt;/math&gt;
(where “[[ceteris paribus|c.p.]]” indicates that the ''only'' [[Dependent and independent variables|independent variable]] to change is &lt;math&gt;g\,&lt;/math&gt;).

Mainstream neoclassical economics will typically assume that the limit
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{\Delta g\to 0} \left.\frac{\Delta U}{\Delta g}\right|_{c.p.}&lt;/math&gt;
exists, and use “marginal utility” to refer to the [[partial derivative]]
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial U}{\partial g}=\lim_{\Delta g\to 0}\left.\frac{\Delta U}{\Delta g}\right|_{c.p.}&lt;/math&gt;.
Accordingly, diminishing marginal utility corresponds to the condition
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial^2 U}{\partial g^2}&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;.

== History ==
The concept of marginal utility grew out of attempts by economists to explain the determination of price.  The term “marginal utility”, credited to the [[Austrian School|Austrian]] economist [[Friedrich von Wieser]] by [[Alfred Marshall]],&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, Alfred; ''Principles of Economics'',  3 Ch 3 Note.&lt;/ref&gt; was a translation of Wieser's term “Grenznutzen” (''border-use'').&lt;ref name="wieser_ein"&gt;von Wieser,  Friedrich; ''Über  den Ursprung und die Hauptgesetze des wirtschaftlichen Wertes'' &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''The Nature and  Essence of Theoretical Economics''&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; (1884), p.  128.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref  name="wieser_zwei"&gt;Wieser, Friedrich von; ''Der natürliche Werth''  &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''Natural Value''&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; (1889), Bk I Ch V  “Marginal Utility” ([http://praxeology.net/FW-NV-I-5.htm HTML]).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Proto-marginalist approaches ===
Perhaps the essence of a notion of diminishing marginal utility can be found in [[Aristotle]]'s [[Politics (Aristotle)|''Politics'']], wherein he writes {{Quotation|external goods have a limit, like any other instrument, and all things useful are of such a nature that where there is too much of them they must either do harm, or at any rate be of no use&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristotle]], ''Politics'', Bk 7 Chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt;}} (There has been marked disagreement about the development and role of marginal considerations in Aristotle's value theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Soudek |first=Josef |title=Aristotle's Theory of Exchange: An Inquiry into the Origin of Economic Analysis |journal=Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society |volume=96 |issue=1 |year=1952 |pages=45–75 |jstor=3143742 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kauder"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kauder |first=Emil |title=Genesis of the Marginal Utility Theory from Aristotle to the End of the Eighteenth Century |journal=[[The Economic Journal]] |volume=63 |issue=251 |year=1953 |pages=638–50 |jstor=2226451 |doi=10.2307/2226451}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gordon |first=Barry Lewis John |title=Aristotle and the Development of Value Theory |journal=[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]] |volume=78 |issue=1 |pages=115–28 |year=1964 |jstor=1880547 |doi=10.2307/1880547}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="schumArist"&gt;Schumpeter, Joseph Alois; ''History of Economic Analysis'' (1954) Part II Chapter 1 §3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meikle, Scott; ''Aristoteles' Economic Thought'' (1995) Chapters 1, 2, &amp; 6.&lt;/ref&gt;)

A great variety of economists have concluded that there is ''some'' sort of interrelationship between utility and rarity that affects economic decisions, and in turn informs the determination of prices. Diamonds are priced higher than water because their marginal utility is higher than water .&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Přibram|Přibram, Karl]]; ''A History of Economic Reasoning'' (1983).&lt;/ref&gt;

Eighteenth-century Italian [[Mercantilism|mercantilists]], such as [[Antonio Genovesi]], [[Giammaria Ortes]], [[Pietro Verri]], [[Cesare, Marquis of Beccaria|Marchese Cesare di Beccaria]], and [[Giovanni Rinaldo|Count Giovanni Rinaldo Carli]], held that value was explained in terms of the general utility and of scarcity, though they did not typically work-out a theory of how these interacted.&lt;ref name="pribramItalMerc"&gt;Pribram, Karl; ''A History of Economic Reasoning'' (1983), Chapter 5 “Refined Mercantilism”, “Italian Mercantilists”.&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''Della moneta'' (1751), Abbé [[Ferdinando Galiani]], a pupil of Genovesi, attempted to explain value as a ratio of two ratios, ''utility'' and ''scarcity'', with the latter component ratio being the ratio of quantity to use.
[[Image:Richard Whately.jpg|thumb|right|105px|Richard Whately]]
[[Anne Robert Jacques Turgot]], in ''Réflexions sur la formation et la distribution de richesse'' (1769), held that value derived from the general utility of the class to which a good belonged, from comparison of present and future wants, and from anticipated difficulties in procurement.

Like the Italian mercantists, [[Étienne Bonnot de Condillac|Étienne Bonnot, Abbé de Condillac]], saw value as determined by utility associated with the class to which the good belong, and by estimated scarcity.  In ''De commerce et le gouvernement'' (1776), Condillac emphasized that value is not based upon cost but that costs were paid because of value.

This last point was famously restated by the Nineteenth Century proto-marginalist, [[Richard Whately]], who in ''Introductory Lectures on Political Economy'' (1832) wrote {{Quotation|It is not that pearls fetch a high price because men have dived for them; but on the contrary, men dive for them because they fetch a high price.&lt;ref&gt;Whately, Richard; ''Introductory Lectures on Political Economy, Being part of a course delivered in the Easter term'' (1832).&lt;/ref&gt;}} (Whatley's student [[Nassau William Senior|Senior]] is noted below as an early marginalist.)

=== Marginalists before the Revolution ===

The first unambiguous published statement of any sort of theory of marginal utility was by [[Daniel Bernoulli]], in “Specimen theoriae novae de mensura sortis”.&lt;ref&gt;Bernoulli, Daniel; “Specimen theoriae novae de mensura sortis” in ''Commentarii Academiae Scientiarum Imperialis Petropolitanae'' 5 (1738); reprinted in translation as “Exposition of a new theory on the measurement of risk” in ''Econometrica'' 22 (1954).&lt;/ref&gt;  This paper appeared in 1738, but a draft had been written in 1731 or in 1732.&lt;ref&gt;Bernoulli, Daniel; letter of 4 July 1731 to Nicolas Bernoulli ([http://www.cs.xu.edu/math/Sources/Montmort/stpetersburg.pdf#search=%22Nicolas%20Bernoulli%22 excerpted in PDF] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080909221757/http://www.cs.xu.edu/math/Sources/Montmort/stpetersburg.pdf |date=2008-09-09 }}).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bernoulli, Nicolas; letter of 5 April 1732, acknowledging receipt of “Specimen theoriae novae metiendi sortem pecuniariam” ([http://www.cs.xu.edu/math/Sources/Montmort/stpetersburg.pdf#search=%22Nicolas%20Bernoulli%22 excerpted in PDF] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080909221757/http://www.cs.xu.edu/math/Sources/Montmort/stpetersburg.pdf |date=2008-09-09 }}).&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1728, [[Gabriel Cramer]] had produced fundamentally the same theory in a private letter.&lt;ref&gt;Cramer, Garbriel; letter of 21 May 1728 to [[Nicolaus I Bernoulli|Nicolaus Bernoulli]] ([http://www.cs.xu.edu/math/Sources/Montmort/stpetersburg.pdf#search=%22Nicolas%20Bernoulli%22 excerpted in PDF] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080909221757/http://www.cs.xu.edu/math/Sources/Montmort/stpetersburg.pdf |date=2008-09-09 }}).&lt;/ref&gt;  Each had sought to resolve the [[St. Petersburg paradox]], and had concluded that the marginal desirability of money decreased as it was accumulated, more specifically such that the desirability of a sum were the [[natural logarithm]] (Bernoulli) or [[square root]] (Cramer) thereof.  However, the more general implications of this hypothesis were not explicated, and the work fell into obscurity.

In [http://socserv2.socsci.mcmaster.ca/~econ/ugcm/3ll3/lloyd/value “A Lecture on the Notion of Value as Distinguished Not Only from Utility, but also from Value in Exchange”], delivered in 1833 and included in ''Lectures on Population, Value, Poor Laws and Rent'' (1837), [[William Forster Lloyd]] explicitly offered a general marginal utility theory, but did not offer its derivation nor elaborate its implications.  The importance of his statement seems to have been lost on everyone (including Lloyd) until the early 20th century, by which time others had independently developed and popularized the same insight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=Edwin Robert Anderson Seligman |last=Seligman |first=E. R. A. |title=On Some Neglected British Economists |journal=[[The Economic Journal]] |volume=13 |issue=51 |pages=335–63 |year=1903 |jstor=2221519 |doi=10.2307/2221519}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''An Outline of the Science of Political Economy'' (1836), [[Nassau William Senior]] asserted that marginal utilities were the ultimate determinant of demand, yet apparently did not pursue implications, though some interpret his work as indeed doing just that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=White |first=Michael V. |title=Diamonds Are Forever(?): Nassau Senior and Utility Theory |journal=[[The Manchester School (journal)|The Manchester School]] |volume=60 |year=1992 |issue=1 |pages=64–78 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9957.1992.tb00211.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In “De la mesure de l’utilité des travaux publics” (1844), [[Jules Dupuit]] applied a conception of marginal utility to the problem of determining bridge tolls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dupuit |first=Jules |title=De la mesure de l’utilité des travaux publics |journal=Annales des ponts et chaussées |series=Second series |volume=8 |year=1844 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1854, [[Hermann Heinrich Gossen]] published ''Die Entwicklung der Gesetze des menschlichen Verkehrs und der daraus fließenden Regeln für menschliches Handeln'', which presented a marginal utility theory and to a very large extent worked-out its implications for the behavior of a market economy.  However, Gossen's work was not well received in the Germany of his time, most copies were destroyed unsold, and he was virtually forgotten until rediscovered after the so-called Marginal Revolution.

=== The Marginal Revolution ===
Marginalism eventually found a foothold by way of the work of three economists, [[William Stanley Jevons|Jevons]] in England, [[Carl Menger|Menger]] in Austria, and [[Léon Walras|Walras]] in Switzerland.
[[Image:Jevons.jpeg|thumb|105px|William Stanley Jevons]]
[[William Stanley Jevons]] first proposed the theory in [http://socserv2.socsci.mcmaster.ca/~econ/ugcm/3ll3/jevons/mathem.txt “A General Mathematical Theory of Political Economy”] ([http://www.eco.utexas.edu/~hmcleave/jevonsmath.pdf PDF]), a paper presented in 1862 and published in 1863, followed by a series of works culminating in his book ''The Theory of Political Economy'' in 1871 that established his reputation as a leading political economist and logician of the time. Jevons' conception of utility was in the [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] tradition of [[Jeremy Bentham]] and of [[John Stuart Mill]], but he differed from his [[classical economics|classical]] predecessors in emphasizing that "value depends entirely upon utility", in particular, on "final utility upon which the theory of Economics will be found to turn."&lt;ref&gt;W. Stanley Jevons (1871), ''The Theory of Political Economy'', p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; He later qualified this in deriving the result that in a model of exchange equilibrium, price ratios would be proportional not only to ratios of "final degrees of utility," but also to costs of production.&lt;ref&gt;W. Stanley Jevons (1879, 2nd ed.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=aYcBAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=jevons+%22the+theory+of+political+economy%22&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=IyxPG-thjm&amp;sig=ta6Vv6bIPxNZVaqyxFoGfv39Od8#PPA203,M1 ''The Theory of Political Economy''], p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R.D. Collison Brown (1987), "Jevons, William Stanley," [[The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics]], v. 2, pp. 1008–09.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carl Menger]] presented the theory in [http://docs.mises.de/Menger/Menger_Grundsaetze.pdf ''Grundsätze der Volkswirtschaftslehre''] (translated as [https://www.mises.org/etexts/menger/principles.asp ''Principles of Economics'']) in 1871.  Menger's presentation is peculiarly notable on two points.  First, he took special pains to explain ''why'' individuals should be expected to rank possible uses and then to use marginal utility to decide amongst trade-offs. (For this reason, Menger and his followers are sometimes called “the Psychological School”, though they are more frequently known as “the [[Austrian School]]” or as “the Vienna School”.) Second, while his illustrative examples present utility as quantified, his essential assumptions do not.&lt;ref name="georgescu-rogen" /&gt; (Menger in fact crossed-out the numerical tables in his own copy of the published ''Grundsätze''.&lt;ref&gt;Kauder, Emil; ''A History of Marginal Utility Theory'' (1965), p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;) Menger also developed the [[law of diminishing marginal utility]].&lt;ref name=Mises&gt;Polleit, Thorsten (2011-02-11) [https://mises.org/daily/5014/What-Can-the-Law-of-Diminishing-Marginal-Utility-Teach-Us What Can the Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility Teach Us?], ''[[Mises Institute]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Menger's work found a significant and appreciative audience.

[[Léon Walras|Marie-Esprit-Léon Walras]] introduced the theory in ''Éléments d'économie politique pure'', the first part of which was published in 1874 in a relatively mathematical exposition.  Walras's work found relatively few readers at the time but was recognized and incorporated two decades later in the work of [[Vilfredo Pareto|Pareto]] and [[Enrico Barone|Barone]].&lt;ref&gt;Donald A. Walker  (1987), "Walras, Léon" ''The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics, v. 4, p. 862.&lt;/ref&gt;

An American, [[John Bates Clark]], is sometimes also mentioned.  But, while Clark independently arrived at a marginal utility theory, he did little to advance it until it was clear that the followers of Jevons, Menger, and Walras were revolutionizing economics.  Nonetheless, his contributions thereafter were profound.

==== The second generation ====
[[Image:Vilfredo Pareto 1870s2.jpg|thumb|105px|Vilfredo Pareto]]
Although the Marginal Revolution flowed from the work of Jevons, Menger, and Walras, their work might have failed to enter the mainstream were it not for a second generation of economists.  In England, the second generation were exemplified by [[Philip Wicksteed|Philip Henry Wicksteed]], by [[William Smart (economist)|William Smart]], and by [[Alfred Marshall]]; in Austria by [[Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk]] and by [[Friedrich von Wieser]]; in Switzerland by [[Vilfredo Pareto]]; and in America by [[Herbert Joseph Davenport]] and by [[Frank Fetter|Frank A. Fetter]].

There were significant, distinguishing features amongst the approaches of Jevons, Menger, and Walras, but the second generation did not maintain distinctions along national or linguistic lines.  The work of von Wieser was heavily influenced by that of Walras.  Wicksteed was heavily influenced by Menger.  Fetter referred to himself and Davenport as part of “the American Psychological School”, named in imitation of the Austrian “Psychological School”. (And Clark's work from this period onward similarly shows heavy influence by Menger.)  William Smart began as a conveyor of Austrian School theory to English-language readers, though he fell increasingly under the influence of Marshall.&lt;ref name="salerno"&gt;Salerno, Joseph T. 1999; “The Place of Mises’s Human Action in the Development of Modern Economic Thought.” ''Quarterly Journal of Economic Thought'' v. 2 (1).&lt;/ref&gt;

Böhm-Bawerk was perhaps the most able expositor of Menger's conception.&lt;ref name="salerno" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Böhm-Bawerk, Eugen Ritter von. “Grundzüge der Theorie des wirtschaftlichen Güterwerthes”, ''Jahrbüche für Nationalökonomie und Statistik'' v 13 (1886).  Translated as ''Basic Principles of Economic Value''.&lt;/ref&gt;  He was further noted for producing a theory of interest and of profit in equilibrium based upon the interaction of diminishing marginal utility with diminishing [[marginal product]]ivity of time and with [[time preference]].&lt;ref&gt;Böhm-Bawerk, Eugen Ritter von; ''Kapital Und Kapitalizns. Zweite Abteilung: Positive Theorie des Kapitales'' (1889). Translated as ''Capital and Interest. II: Positive Theory of Capital'' with appendices rendered as ''Further Essays on Capital and Interest''.&lt;/ref&gt; (This theory was adopted in full and then further developed by [[Knut Wicksell]]&lt;ref&gt;Wicksell, Johan Gustaf Knut; ''Über Wert, Kapital unde Rente'' (1893). Translated as [https://www.mises.org/books/valuecapital.pdf ''Value, Capital and Rent''.]&lt;/ref&gt; and, with modifications including formal disregard for time-preference, by Wicksell's American rival [[Irving Fisher]].&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, Irving; ''Theory of Interest'' (1930).&lt;/ref&gt;)

Marshall was the second-generation marginalist whose work on marginal utility came most to inform the mainstream of neoclassical economics, especially by way of his ''Principles of Economics'', the first volume of which was published in 1890.  Marshall constructed the demand curve with the aid of assumptions that utility was quantified, and that the marginal utility of money was constant (or nearly so).  Like Jevons, Marshall did not see an explanation for supply in the theory of marginal utility, so he synthesized an explanation of demand thus explained with supply explained in a more [[Classical economics|classical]] manner, determined by costs which were taken to be objectively determined.  (Marshall later actively mischaracterized the criticism that these costs were themselves ultimately determined by marginal utilities.&lt;ref name="schumMarshScis"&gt;Schumpeter, Joseph Alois; ''History of Economic Analysis'' (1954) Pt IV Ch 6 §4.&lt;/ref&gt;)

==== The Marginal Revolution and Marxism ====
[[Karl Marx]] acknowledged that "nothing can have value, without being an object of utility",&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl Heinrich; ''Capital'' V1 Ch 1 §1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl Heinrich; [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1857/grundrisse/f239-289.htm ''Grundrisse''] (completed in 1857 though not published until much later)&lt;/ref&gt; but, in his analysis, "use-value as such lies outside the sphere of investigation of political economy",&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Marx|Marx, Karl Heinrich]]: ''A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy''] (1859), p. 276&lt;/ref&gt; with labor being the principal determinant of value under capitalism.

The doctrines of marginalism and the Marginal Revolution are often interpreted as somehow a response to [[Marxism|Marxist economics]]. However the first volume of ''[[Das Kapital]]'' was not published until July 1867, after the works of Jevons, Menger, and Walras were written or well under way (In 1874 Walras published Éléments d'économie politique pure and Carl Menger published Principles of Economics in 1871) ; and Marx was still a relatively minor figure when these works were completed. It is unlikely that any of them knew anything of him. (On the other hand, [[Friedrich Hayek|Hayek]] or [[William Warren Bartley|Bartley]] has suggested that Marx, voraciously reading at the [[British Museum]], may have come across the works of one or more of these figures, and that his inability to formulate a viable critique may account for his failure to complete any further volumes of ''Kapital'' before his death.&lt;ref&gt;Hayek, Friedrich August von, with [[William Warren Bartley|William Warren Bartley III]]; ''The Fatal Conceit: The Errors of Socialism'' (1988) p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;)

Nonetheless, it is not unreasonable to suggest that the generation who followed the preceptors of the Revolution succeeded partly because they could formulate straightforward responses to Marxist economic theory. The most famous of these was that of Böhm-Bawerk, ''Zum Abschluss des Marxschen Systems'' (1896),&lt;ref&gt;Böhm-Bawerk, Eugen Ritter von: "''Zum Abschluss des Marxschen Systems''" &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;"On the Closure of the Marxist System"&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, ''Staatswiss. Arbeiten. Festgabe für [[Karl Knies|K. Knies]]'' (1896).&lt;/ref&gt; but the first was Wicksteed's "The Marxian Theory of Value. ''Das Kapital'': a criticism" (1884,&lt;ref&gt;Wicksteed, Philip Henry; "Das Kapital: A Criticism", ''To-day'' 2 (1884) pp. 388–409.&lt;/ref&gt; followed by "The Jevonian criticism of Marx: a rejoinder" in 1885&lt;ref&gt;Wicksteed, Philip Henry; "The Jevonian criticism of Marx: a rejoinder", ''To-day'' 3 (1885) pp. 177–79.&lt;/ref&gt;). Initially there were only a few Marxist responses to marginalism, of which the most famous were [[Rudolf Hilferding]]'s ''Böhm-Bawerks Marx-Kritik'' (1904)&lt;ref&gt;Hilferding, Rudolf: ''Böhm-Bawerks Marx-Kritik'' (1904). Translated as ''Böhm-Bawerk's Criticism of Marx''.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Politicheskoy ekonomni rante'' (1914) by [[Nikolai Bukharin|Никола́й Ива́нович Буха́рин (Nikolai Bukharin)]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Nikolai Bukharin|Буха́рин, Никола́й Ива́нович (Nikolai Ivanovich Bukharin)]]; ''Политической экономии рантье'' (1914). Translated as [http://www.marxists.org/archive/bukharin/works/1927/leisure-economics/ ''The Economic Theory of the Leisure Class''].&lt;/ref&gt; However, over the course of the 20th century a considerable literature developed on the conflict between marginalism and the labour theory of value, with the work of the neo-Ricardian economist [[Piero Sraffa]] providing an important critique of marginalism.

It might also be noted that some followers of [[Henry George]] similarly consider marginalism and neoclassical economics a reaction to ''[[Progress and Poverty]]'', which was published in 1879.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mason Gaffney|Gaffney, Mason]], and Fred Harrison: ''The Corruption of Economics'' (1994).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s [[John Roemer]] and other [[Analytical Marxism#Exploitation|analytical Marxists]] have worked to rebuild Marxian theses on a marginalist foundation.

=== Reformulation ===
In his 1881 work [http://socserv.mcmaster.ca/econ/ugcm/3ll3/edgeworth/mathpsychics.pdf ''Mathematical Psychics''], [[Francis Ysidro Edgeworth]] presented the [[indifference curve]], deriving its properties from marginalist theory which assumed utility to be a differentiable function of quantified goods and services. Later work attempted to generalize to the indifference curve formulations of utility and marginal utility in avoiding unobservable measures of utility.

In 1915, [[Eugen Slutsky]] derived a theory of consumer choice solely from properties of indifference curves.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eugen Slutsky|Слуцкий, Евгений Евгениевич (Slutsky, Yevgyeniy Ye.)]]; "Sulla teoria del bilancio del consumatore", ''Giornale degli Economisti'' 51 (1915).&lt;/ref&gt; Because of [[World War I|the World War]], the [[October Revolution|Bolshevik Revolution]], and his own subsequent loss of interest, Slutsky's work drew almost no notice, but similar work in 1934 by [[John Hicks|John Richard Hicks]] and [[R. G. D. Allen]]&lt;ref&gt;Hicks, John Richard, and Roy George Douglas Allen; "A Reconsideration of the Theory of Value", ''Economica'' 54 (1934).&lt;/ref&gt; derived much the same results and found a significant audience. (Allen subsequently drew attention to Slutsky's earlier accomplishment.)

Although some of the third generation of Austrian School economists had by 1911 rejected the quantification of utility while continuing to think in terms of marginal utility,&lt;ref name="mises" /&gt; most economists presumed that utility must be a sort of quantity. Indifference curve analysis seemed to represent a way to dispense with presumptions of quantification, albeit that a seemingly arbitrary assumption (admitted by Hicks to be a "rabbit out of a hat"&lt;ref&gt;Hicks, Sir John Richard; ''Value and Capital'', Chapter I. 2"Utility and Preference" §8, p. 23 in the 2nd edition.&lt;/ref&gt;) about decreasing marginal rates of substitution&lt;ref name="hicks_vc"&gt;Hicks, Sir John Richard; ''Value and Capital'', Chapter I. "Utility and Preference" §7–8.&lt;/ref&gt; would then have to be introduced to have convexity of indifference curves.

For those who accepted that indifference curve analysis superseded earlier marginal utility analysis, the latter became at best perhaps pedagogically useful, but "old fashioned" and observationally unnecessary.&lt;ref name="hicks_vc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="samuelson"&gt;Samuelson, Paul Anthony; "Complementarity: An Essay on the 40th Anniversary of the Hicks-Allen Revolution in Demand Theory", ''Journal of Economic Literature'' vol 12 (1974).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Revival ===
[[Image:JohnvonNeumann-LosAlamos.gif|thumb|105px|[[John von Neumann]]]]
When Cramer and Bernoulli introduced the notion of diminishing marginal utility, it had been to address [[St. Petersburg paradox|a paradox of gambling]], rather than the [[paradox of value]].  The marginalists of the revolution, however, had been formally concerned with problems in which there was neither [[risk]] nor [[uncertainty]].  So too with the indifference curve analysis of Slutsky, Hicks, and Allen.

The [[expected utility hypothesis]] of Bernoulli and others was revived by various 20th century thinkers, with early contributions by [[Frank P. Ramsey|Ramsey]] (1926),&lt;ref&gt;Ramsey, Frank Plumpton; "Truth and Probability" ([http://cepa.newschool.edu/het//texts/ramsey/ramsess.pdf  PDF] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227205205/http://cepa.newschool.edu/het//texts/ramsey/ramsess.pdf |date=2008-02-27 }}), Chapter VII in ''The Foundations of Mathematics and other Logical Essays'' (1931).&lt;/ref&gt; [[John von Neumann|von Neumann]] and [[Oskar Morgenstern|Morgenstern]] (1944),&lt;ref&gt;von Neumann, John and Oskar Morgenstern; ''[[Theory of Games and Economic Behavior]]'' (1944).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Leonard Jimmie Savage|Savage]] (1954).&lt;ref&gt;Savage, Leonard Jimmie: ''Foundations of Statistics'' (1954).&lt;/ref&gt; Although this hypothesis remains controversial, it brings not only utility, but a quantified conception of utility (cardinal utility), back into the mainstream of economic thought.

A major reason why quantified models of utility are influential today is that risk and uncertainty have been recognized as central topics in contemporary economic theory.&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, Peter, and Michael Rothschild, eds.: ''Uncertainty in Economics'' (1989). Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Quantified utility models simplify the analysis of risky decisions because, under quantified utility, diminishing marginal utility implies [[risk aversion]].&lt;ref&gt;Demange, Gabriel, and Guy Laroque: ''Finance and the Economics of Uncertainty'' (2006), Ch. 3, pp. 71–72. Blackwell Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, many contemporary analyses of saving and portfolio choice require stronger assumptions than diminishing marginal utility, such as the assumption of [[Prudence#Prudence in economics and finance|prudence]], which means [[convex function|convex]] marginal utility.&lt;ref&gt;Kimball, Miles (1990), "Precautionary Saving in the Small and in the Large", ''[[Econometrica]]'', 58 (1) pp. 53–73.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the Austrian School continued to develop its ordinalist notions of marginal utility analysis, formally demonstrating that from them proceed the decreasing marginal rates of substitution of indifference curves.&lt;ref name="mc_culloch" /&gt;

The Metropolis Project's principal decision-making body is an International Steering Committee of representatives from over 40 countries. The Project is managed by a Secretariat with offices in [[Ottawa]], [[Amsterdam]] and in Asia with functions distributed across organizations in Seoul, Manila and Beijing. The Ottawa Secretariat is responsible for establishing the Project’s strategic directions.  Howard Duncan is the Project's Executive Head.

==Metropolis Professional Development==

The Metropolis Project launched in April 2014 a new training program for senior policy-makers, senior managers of settlement agencies, officials of international organizations and the private sector. The programme is intended to provide participants with information, analysis and tools on the management of migration and integration. A pilot training will be offered in June 2014. Metropolis Professional Development has been developed in collaboration with worldwide renowned experts such as [[Graeme Hugo]] (University of Adelaide), Jan Niessen (Migration Policy Group), Imelda Nicolas (Commission on Filipinos Overseas) and Peter Schatzer (IOM) among many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://carleton.ca/metropolis/about-us-2/what-we-do/training/|title=Metropolis Professional Development Website}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==

The Metropolis Project partners with Springer in the publication of an academic journal, the ''Journal of International Migration and Integration'' (''Revue de l'intégration et de la migration internationale''). It is published quarterly, in both [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]]; its first issue was in Winter, 2000. The managing editor for the 2013-2014 issue is Lori Wilkinson of the [[University of Manitoba]].

== Annual Conference ==
The project has hosted an international conference concerning research and policy on human migration annually since 1996. The 2015 meeting will be held in [[Mexico City]], [[Mexico]] in September 2015 ([http://www.metropolis2015.unam.mx/ Metropolis 2015 site]) with the slogan "Migrants: Key Players in the 21st Century".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7742">In [[quantum field theory]], the term '''moduli''' (or more properly '''moduli fields''') is sometimes used to refer to [[scalar field]]s whose potential energy function has continuous families of global minima.  Such potential functions frequently occur in [[supersymmetry|supersymmetric]] systems.  The term "modulus" is borrowed from mathematics, where it is used synonymously with "parameter".  The word moduli (''Moduln'' in German) first appeared in 1857 in [[Bernhard Riemann]]'s celebrated paper "Theorie der Abel'schen Functionen".&lt;ref name=dist&gt;Bernhard Riemann, Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik, vol. 54 (1857), pp. 101-155

== Moduli spaces in quantum field theories ==
In quantum field theories, the possible vacua are usually labelled by the vacuum expectation values of scalar fields, as Lorentz invariance forces the vacuum expectation values of any higher spin fields to vanish.  These vacuum expectation values can take any value for which the potential function is a minimum.   Consequently, when the potential function has continuous families of global minima, the space of vacua for the quantum field theory is a manifold (or orbifold), usually called the [[vacuum manifold]].  This manifold is often called the '''moduli space of vacua''', or just the moduli space, for short.

The term '''moduli''' is also used in [[string theory]] to refer to various continuous parameters which label possible [[string background]]s: the expectation value of the [[dilaton]] field, the parameters (e.g. the radius and complex structure) which govern the shape of the compactification manifold, et cetera.   These parameters are represented, in the quantum field theory that approximates the string theory at low energies, by the vacuum expectation values of massless scalar fields, making contact with the usage described above.  In string theory, the term "moduli space" is often used specifically to refer to the space of all possible string backgrounds.

==Moduli spaces of supersymmetric gauge theories==
In general quantum field theories, even if the classical potential energy is minimized over a large set of possible expectation values, generically once quantum corrections are included nearly all of these configurations cease to minimize the energy.  The result is that the set of vacua of the [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]] is generally much smaller than that of the [[classical theory]].  A notable exception occurs when the various vacua in question are related by a [[symmetry]] which guarantees that their energy levels remain exactly degenerate.

The situation is very different in [[supersymmetry|supersymmetric]] quantum field theories.  In general these possess large moduli spaces of vacua which are not related by any symmetry, for example the masses of the various excitations may differ at various points on the moduli space.  The moduli spaces of supersymmetric gauge theories are in general easier to calculate than those of nonsupersymmetric theories because supersymmetry restricts the allowed geometries of the moduli space even when quantum corrections are included.

===Allowed moduli spaces of 4-dimensional theories===
The more supersymmetry there is, the stronger the restriction on the vacuum manifold.  Therefore, if a restriction appears below for a given number N of spinors of supercharges, then it also holds for all greater values of N.

====N=1 Theories====

The first restriction on the geometry of a moduli space was found in 1979 by [[Bruno Zumino]] and published in the article [http://inspirehep.net/record/142186/?ln=en Supersymmetry and Kähler Manifolds].  He considered an N=1 theory in 4-dimensions with global supersymmetry.  N=1 means that the fermionic components of the supersymmetry algebra can be assembled into a single [[Majorana spinor|Majorana]] [[supercharge]].  The only scalars in such a theory are the complex scalars of the [[chiral superfield]]s.  He found that the vacuum manifold of allowed vacuum expectation values for these scalars is not only complex but also a [[Kähler manifold]].

If [[gravity]] is included in the theory, so that there is local supersymmetry, then the resulting theory is called a [[supergravity]] theory and the restriction on the geometry of the moduli space becomes stronger.  The moduli space must not only be Kähler, but also the Kähler form must lift to integral [[cohomology]].  Such manifolds are called [[Hodge manifold]]s.  The first example appeared in the 1979 article [http://www.slac.stanford.edu/spires/find/hep/www?j=NUPHA,B147,105  Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking and Higgs Effect in Supergravity Without Cosmological Constant] and the general statement appeared 3 years later in [https://inspirehep.net/record/11988/  Quantization of Newton's Constant in Certain Supergravity Theories].

====N=2 Theories====

In extended 4-dimensional theories with N=2 supersymmetry, corresponding to a single [[Dirac spinor]] supercharge, the conditions are stronger.  The N=2 supersymmetry algebra contains two [[representation theory|representation]]s with scalars, the [[vector superfield|vector multiplet]] which contains a complex scalar and the [[hypermultiplet]] which contains two complex scalars.  The moduli space of the vector multiplets is called the [[Coulomb branch]] while that of the hypermultiplets is called the [[Higgs branch]].  The total moduli space is locally a product of these two branches, as [[supersymmetry nonrenormalization theorems|nonrenormalization theorems]] imply that the metric of each is independent of the fields of the other multiplet.(See for example Argyres, [http://homepages.uc.edu/~argyrepc/cu661-gr-SUSY/fgilec.pdf Non-Perturbative Dynamics Of Four-Dimensional Supersymmetric Field Theories], pp.&amp;nbsp;6–7, for further discussion of the local product structure.)

In the case of global N=2 supersymmetry, in other words in the absence of gravity, the Coulomb branch of the moduli space is a [[special Kähler manifold]].  The first example of this restriction appeared in the 1984 article [https://inspirehep.net/record/202378/  Potentials and Symmetries of General Gauged N=2 Supergravity: Yang-Mills Models] by [[Bernard de Wit]] and [[Antoine Van Proeyen]], while a general geometric description of the underlying geometry, called [[special geometry]], was present by [[Andrew Strominger]] in his 1990 paper [http://inspirehep.net/record/26953  Special Geometry].

The Higgs branch is a [[hyperkähler manifold]] as was shown by [[Luis Alvarez-Gaume]] and [[Daniel Z. Freedman|Daniel Freedman]] in their 1981 paper [https://inspirehep.net/record/10231/  Geometrical Structure and Ultraviolet Finiteness in the Supersymmetric Sigma Model].  Including gravity the supersymmetry becomes local.  Then one needs to add the same Hodge condition to the special Kahler Coulomb branch as in the N=1 case.  [[Jonathan Bagger]] and [[Edward Witten]] demonstrated in their 1982 paper [http://inspirehep.net/record/13231/  Matter Couplings in N=2 Supergravity] that in this case the Higgs branch must be a [[quaternionic Kähler manifold]].

====N&gt;2 Supersymmetry====

In extended supergravities with N&gt;2 the moduli space must always be a [[symmetric space]].

'''Molecular dynamics''' ('''MD''') is a [[computer simulation]] method for studying the [[Motion (physics)|physical movements]] of [[atoms]] and [[molecules]]. The atoms and molecules are allowed to interact for a fixed period of time, giving a view of the [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamic]] evolution of the system. In the most common version, the [[trajectory|trajectories]] of atoms and molecules are determined by [[Numerical integration|numerically solving]] [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's equations of motion]] for a system of interacting particles, where [[Force (physics)|forces]] between the particles and their [[potential energy|potential energies]] are often calculated using [[interatomic potential]]s or [[molecular mechanics]] [[Force field (chemistry)|force fields]]. The method was originally developed within the field of theoretical physics in the late 1950s&lt;ref name=fput&gt;Fermi E., Pasta J., Ulam S., Los Alamos report LA-1940 (1955).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= a&amp;w&gt;{{cite journal

Because molecular systems typically consist of a vast number of particles, it is impossible to determine the properties of such [[complex systems]] analytically; MD simulation circumvents this problem by using [[Numerical analysis|numerical]] methods. However, long MD simulations are mathematically [[condition number|ill-conditioned]], generating cumulative errors in numerical integration that can be minimized with proper selection of algorithms and parameters, but not eliminated entirely.

For systems which obey the [[ergodic hypothesis]], the evolution of one molecular dynamics simulation may be used to determine macroscopic [[thermodynamic]] properties of the system: the time averages of an ergodic system correspond to [[microcanonical ensemble]] averages.

== History ==
Following the earlier successes of [[Monte Carlo simulation]]s, the method was first developed by Fermi, Pasta, Ulam and [[Mary Tsingou|Tsingou]]&lt;ref name=fput /&gt; in the mid 50s. In 1957, [[Berni Alder|Alder]] and Wainwright used an [[IBM 704]] computer to simulate perfectly elastic collisions between [[hard spheres]].&lt;ref name=a&amp;w /&gt; In 1960, Gibson et al., simulated radiation damage of solid [[copper]] by using a Born-Mayer type of repulsive interaction along with a cohesive surface force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1= J B |last1= Gibson |first2= A N |last2= Goland |first3= M |last3= Milgram |first4= G H |last4= Vineyard |year= 1960 |title= Dynamics of Radiation Damage |journal= Phys.

Calculations of system properties, such as the coefficient of [[self-diffusion]], compared well with experimental data.&lt;ref name=a.rahman /&gt;

Even before it became possible to simulate molecular dynamics with computers, some undertook the hard work of trying it with physical models such as macroscopic spheres. The idea was to arrange them to replicate the properties of a liquid. [[J.D. Bernal]] said, in 1962: "''... I took a number of rubber balls and stuck them together with rods of a selection of different lengths ranging from 2.75 to 4 inches. I tried to do this in the first place as casually as possible, working in my own office, being interrupted every five minutes or so and not remembering what I had done before the interruption.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first= J.D. |last= Bernal |year= 1964 |title= The Bakerian lecture, 1962: The structure of liquids |journal= Proceedings of the Royal Society |volume= 280 |issue= 1382 |pages= 299–322 |id= |url= |doi= 10.1098/rspa.1964.0147|bibcode= 1964RSPSA.280..299B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Areas of application and limits ==

Beginning in theoretical [[physics]], the method of MD gained popularity in [[materials science]] and since the 1970s also in [[biochemistry]] and [[biophysics]]. MD is frequently used to refine 3-dimensional structures of [[protein]]s and other [[macromolecule]]s based on experimental constraints from [[X-ray crystallography]] or [[Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy|NMR spectroscopy]]. In physics, MD is used to examine the dynamics of atomic-level phenomena that cannot be observed directly, such as thin film growth and ion-subplantation, and also to examine the physical properties of [[nanotechnology|nanotechnological]] devices that have not or cannot yet be created. In biophysics and [[structural biology]], the method is frequently applied to study the motions of macromolecules such as [[protein]]s and [[nucleic acid]]s, which can be useful for interpreting the results of certain biophysical experiments and for modeling interactions with other molecules, as in [[ligand docking]]. In principle MD can be used for [[De novo protein structure prediction|ab initio prediction]] of [[protein structure]] by simulating [[protein folding|folding]] of the [[polypeptide chain]] from [[random coil]].

The results of MD simulations can be tested through comparison to experiments that measure molecular dynamics, of which a popular method is NMR spectroscopy. MD-derived structure predictions can be tested through community-wide experiments in Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction ([[CASP]]), although the method has historically had limited success in this area. [[Michael Levitt]], who shared the [[Nobel Prize]] partly for the application of MD to proteins, wrote in 1999 that CASP participants usually did not use the method due to "''... a central embarrassment of molecular mechanics, namely that energy minimization or molecular dynamics generally leads to a model that is less like the experimental structure.''"&lt;ref name="Koehl"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Koehl |first1= P. |authorlink2= Michael Levitt |last2= Levitt |first2= Michael |year= 1999 |title= A brighter future for protein structure prediction |url= |journal= [[Nature Structural Biology]] |volume= 6 |issue= |pages= 108–111}}&lt;/ref&gt; Improvements in computational resources permitting more and longer MD trajectories, combined with modern improvements in the quality of [[force field (chemistry)|force field]] parameters, have yielded some improvements in both structure prediction and [[homology model]] refinement, without reaching the point of practical utility in these areas; many identify force field parameters as a key area for further development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Raval|first1=A|last2=Piana|first2=S|last3=Eastwood|first3=MP|last4=Dror|first4=RO|last5=Shaw|first5=DE|title=Refinement of protein structure homology models via long, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations.|journal=Proteins|date=August 2012|volume=80|issue=8|pages=2071–9|pmid=22513870|doi=10.1002/prot.24098}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beauchamp|first1=KA|last2=Lin|first2=YS|last3=Das|first3=R|last4=Pande|first4=VS|title=Are Protein Force Fields Getting Better?

Limits of the method are related to the parameter sets used, and to the underlying [[molecular mechanics]] force fields. One run of an MD simulation optimizes the [[potential energy]], rather than the [[Gibbs free energy|free energy]] of the protein {{Dubious|date=July 2017}}, meaning that all [[Entropy|entropic contributions]] to [[thermodynamic stability]] of protein structure are neglected, including the [[conformational entropy]] of the polypeptide chain (the main factor that destabilizes protein structure) and [[hydrophobic effect]]s (the main driving forces of protein folding).&lt;ref&gt;Hydrophobic effects are mostly of entropic nature at room temperature.&lt;/ref&gt; Another important factor are intramolecular [[hydrogen bond]]s,&lt;ref name="Myers"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Myers |first1= J. K. |last2= Pace |first2= C. N. |year= 1996 |title= Hydrogen bonding stabilizes globular proteins |journal= Biophys. J. |volume= 71 |issue= 4 |pages= 2033–2039 |doi=10.1016/s0006-3495(96)79401-8 |pmid= 8889177 |bibcode= 1996BpJ....71.2033M |pmc=1233669}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are not explicitly included in modern force fields, but described as Coulomb interactions of atomic point charges. This is a crude approximation because hydrogen bonds have a partially [[quantum mechanical]] and [[Quantum chemistry|chemical]] nature. Furthermore, electrostatic interactions are usually calculated using the [[Relative permittivity|dielectric constant]] of [[vacuum]], although the surrounding aqueous solution has a much higher dielectric constant. Using the [[macroscopic]] dielectric constant at short interatomic distances is questionable. Finally, [[Van der Waals force|van der Waals interactions]] in MD are usually described by [[Lennard-Jones potential]]s based on the [[Fritz London]] theory that is only applicable in vacuum. However, all types of van der Waals forces are ultimately of electrostatic origin and therefore depend on [[Permittivity|dielectric properties of the environment]].&lt;ref name="Israelachvili"&gt;[[Jacob Israelachvili|Israelachvili, Jacob]] (1992). ''Intermolecular and surface forces.'' Academic Press, San Diego.&lt;/ref&gt; The direct measurement of attraction forces between different materials (as [[Hamaker constant]]) shows that "the interaction between hydrocarbons across water is about 10% of that across vacuum".&lt;ref name="Israelachvili" /&gt; The environment-dependence of van der Waals forces is neglected in standard simulations, but can be included by developing polarizable force fields.

== Design constraints ==

Design of a molecular dynamics simulation should account for the available computational power. Simulation size (n=number of particles), timestep, and total time duration must be selected so that the calculation can finish within a reasonable time period. However, the simulations should be long enough to be relevant to the time scales of the natural processes being studied. To make statistically valid conclusions from the simulations, the time span simulated should match the [[Kinetics (physics)|kinetics]] of the natural process. Otherwise, it is analogous to making conclusions about how a human walks when only looking at less than one footstep. Most scientific publications about the dynamics of proteins and DNA &lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite |author1=Cruz, F.J.A.L. |author2=de Pablo, J.J. |author3=Mota, J.P.B. |title=Endohedral confinement of a DNA dodecamer onto pristine carbon nanotubes and the stability of the canonical B form |journal=J.

To obtain these simulations, several CPU-days to CPU-years are needed. Parallel algorithms allow the load to be distributed among CPUs; an example is the spatial or force decomposition algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;Plimpton, Steve. [http://www.sandia.gov/~sjplimp/md.html Molecular Dynamics - Parallel Algorithms]. sandia.gov&lt;/ref&gt;

During a classical MD simulation, the most CPU intensive task is the evaluation of the [[Force field (chemistry)|potential]] as a function of the particles' internal coordinates. Within that energy evaluation, the most expensive one is the non-bonded or non-covalent part. In [[Big O notation]], common molecular dynamics simulations [[analysis of algorithms|scale]] by &lt;math&gt;O(n^2)&lt;/math&gt; if all pair-wise [[electrostatic]] and [[van der Waals forces|van der Waals interactions]] must be accounted for explicitly. This computational cost can be reduced by employing electrostatics methods such as particle mesh [[Ewald summation]] ( &lt;math&gt;O(n \log(n))&lt;/math&gt; ), particle–particle-particle–mesh ([[P3M]]), or good spherical cutoff methods ( &lt;math&gt;O(n)&lt;/math&gt; ). {{citation needed |date=December 2017}}

Another factor that impacts total CPU time needed by a simulation is the size of the integration timestep. This is the time length between evaluations of the potential. The timestep must be chosen small enough to avoid [[discretization]] errors (i.e., smaller than the period related to fastest vibrational frequency in the system). Typical timesteps for classical MD are in the order of 1&amp;nbsp;femtosecond (10&lt;sup&gt;−15&lt;/sup&gt; s). This value may be extended by using algorithms such as the SHAKE [[constraint algorithm]], which fix the vibrations of the fastest atoms (e.g., hydrogens) into place. Multiple time scale methods have also been developed, which allow extended times between updates of slower long-range forces.&lt;ref name="Streett"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Streett WB, Tildesley DJ, Saville G |year=1978 |title=Multiple time-step methods in molecular dynamics |journal=Mol Phys |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=639–648 |doi=10.1080/00268977800100471|bibcode= 1978MolPh..35..639S |last2=Tildesley |last3=Saville}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tuckerman1991"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Tuckerman ME, Berne BJ, Martyna GJ |year=1991 |title=Molecular dynamics algorithm for multiple time scales: systems with long range forces |journal=J Chem Phys |volume=94 |issue=10 |pages=6811–6815 |doi=10.1063/1.460259|bibcode= 1991JChPh..94.6811T |last2=Berne |last3=Martyna}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tuckerman1992"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Tuckerman ME, Berne BJ, Martyna GJ |year=1992 |title=Reversible multiple time scale molecular dynamics |journal=J Chem Phys |volume=97 |issue=3 |pages=1990–2001 |doi=10.1063/1.463137|bibcode= 1992JChPh..97.1990T |last2=Berne |last3=Martyna}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For simulating molecules in a solvent, a choice should be made between [[Water model|explicit]] and [[implicit solvent]]. Explicit solvent particles (such as the [[TIP3P]], SPC/E and [[Flexible SPC water model|SPC-f]] water models) must be calculated expensively by the force field, while implicit solvents use a mean-field approach. Using an explicit solvent is computationally expensive, requiring inclusion of roughly ten times more particles in the simulation. But the granularity and viscosity of explicit solvent is essential to reproduce certain properties of the solute molecules. This is especially important to reproduce [[chemical kinetics]].

In all kinds of molecular dynamics simulations, the simulation box size must be large enough to avoid [[boundary condition]] artifacts. Boundary conditions are often treated by choosing fixed values at the edges (which may cause artifacts), or by employing [[periodic boundary conditions]] in which one side of the simulation loops back to the opposite side, mimicking a bulk phase (which may cause artifacts too).

=== Microcanonical ensemble (NVE) ===

In the [[microcanonical ensemble]], the system is isolated from changes in moles (N), volume (V), and energy (E). It corresponds to an [[adiabatic process]] with no heat exchange. A microcanonical molecular dynamics trajectory may be seen as an exchange of potential and kinetic energy, with total energy being conserved. For a system of N particles with coordinates &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and velocities &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, the following pair of first order differential equations may be written in [[Newton's notation for differentiation|Newton's notation]] as

:&lt;math&gt;F(X) = -\nabla U(X)=M\dot{V}(t)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;V(t) = \dot{X} (t).&lt;/math&gt;

The potential energy function &lt;math&gt;U(X)&lt;/math&gt; of the system is a function of the particle coordinates &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. It is referred to simply as the ''potential'' in physics, or the ''force field'' in chemistry. The first equation comes from [[Newton's laws of motion]]; the force &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; acting on each particle in the system can be calculated as the negative gradient of &lt;math&gt;U(X)&lt;/math&gt;.

For every time step, each particle's position &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and velocity &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; may be integrated with a [[symplectic integrator]] method such as [[Verlet integration]]. The time evolution of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is called a trajectory. Given the initial positions (e.g., from theoretical knowledge) and velocities (e.g., randomized Gaussian), we can calculate all future (or past) positions and velocities.

One frequent source of confusion is the meaning of [[temperature]] in MD. Commonly we have experience with macroscopic temperatures, which involve a huge number of particles. But temperature is a statistical quantity. If there is a large enough number of atoms, statistical temperature can be estimated from the ''instantaneous temperature'', which is found by equating the kinetic energy of the system to nk&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;T/2 where n is the number of degrees of freedom of the system.

A temperature-related phenomenon arises due to the small number of atoms that are used in MD simulations. For example, consider simulating the growth of a copper film starting with a substrate containing 500 atoms and a deposition energy of 100 eV. In the real world, the 100 eV from the deposited atom would rapidly be transported through and shared among a large number of atoms (&lt;math&gt;10^{10}&lt;/math&gt; or more) with no big change in temperature. When there are only 500 atoms, however, the substrate is almost immediately vaporized by the deposition. Something similar happens in biophysical simulations. The temperature of the system in NVE is naturally raised when macromolecules such as proteins undergo exothermic conformational changes and binding.

=== Canonical ensemble (NVT) ===

In the [[canonical ensemble]], amount of substance (N), volume (V) and temperature (T) are conserved. It is also sometimes called constant temperature molecular dynamics (CTMD). In NVT, the energy of endothermic and exothermic processes is exchanged with a thermostat.

A variety of thermostat algorithms are available to add and remove energy from the boundaries of a MD simulation in a more or less realistic way, approximating the [[canonical ensemble]]. Popular methods to control temperature include velocity rescaling, the [[Nosé-Hoover thermostat]], Nosé-Hoover chains, the [[Berendsen thermostat]], the [[Andersen thermostat]] and [[Langevin dynamics]]. The Berendsen thermostat might introduce the [[flying ice cube]] effect, which leads to unphysical translations and rotations of the simulated system.

It is not trivial to obtain a [[canonical ensemble]] distribution of conformations and velocities using these algorithms. How this depends on system size, thermostat choice, thermostat parameters, time step and integrator is the subject of many articles in the field.

=== Isothermal–isobaric (NPT) ensemble ===

In the [[isothermal–isobaric ensemble]], amount of substance (N), pressure (P) and temperature (T) are conserved. In addition to a thermostat, a barostat is needed. It corresponds most closely to laboratory conditions with a flask open to ambient temperature and pressure.

In the simulation of biological membranes, [[isotropic]] pressure control is not appropriate. For lipid bilayers, pressure control occurs under constant membrane area (NPAT) or constant surface tension "gamma" (NPγT).

=== Generalized ensembles ===

The [[replica exchange]] method is a generalized ensemble. It was originally created to deal with the slow dynamics of disordered spin systems. It is also called parallel tempering. The replica exchange MD (REMD) formulation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

== Potentials in MD simulations ==
{{Main|Interatomic potential|Force field (chemistry)|l2=Force field|Comparison of force field implementations}}
A molecular dynamics simulation requires the definition of a [[function (mathematics)|potential function]], or a description of the terms by which the particles in the simulation will interact. In chemistry and biology this is usually referred to as a [[force field (chemistry)|force field]] and in materials physics as an [[interatomic potential]]. Potentials may be defined at many levels of physical accuracy; those most commonly used in chemistry are based on [[molecular mechanics]] and embody a [[classical mechanics]] treatment of particle-particle interactions that can reproduce structural and [[conformational change]]s but usually cannot reproduce [[chemical reaction]]s.

The reduction from a fully quantum description to a classical potential entails two main approximations. The first one is the [[Born–Oppenheimer approximation]], which states that the dynamics of electrons are so fast that they can be considered to react instantaneously to the motion of their nuclei. As a consequence, they may be treated separately. The second one treats the nuclei, which are much heavier than electrons, as point particles that follow classical Newtonian dynamics. In classical molecular dynamics, the effect of the electrons is approximated as one potential energy surface, usually representing the ground state.

When finer levels of detail are needed, potentials based on [[quantum mechanics]] are used; some methods attempt to create hybrid [[QM/MM|classical/quantum]] potentials where the bulk of the system is treated classically but a small region is treated as a quantum system, usually undergoing a chemical transformation.

=== Empirical potentials ===

Empirical potentials used in chemistry are frequently called [[Force field (chemistry)|force fields]], while those used in materials physics are called [[interatomic potential]]s.

Most [[Force field (chemistry)|force fields]] in chemistry are empirical and consist of a summation of bonded forces associated with [[chemical bond]]s, bond angles, and bond [[dihedral angle|dihedrals]], and non-bonded forces associated with [[van der Waals force]]s and [[electrostatic charge]]. Empirical potentials represent quantum-mechanical effects in a limited way through ad-hoc functional approximations. These potentials contain free parameters such as [[electrostatic charge|atomic charge]], van der Waals parameters reflecting estimates of [[atomic radius]], and equilibrium [[bond length]], angle, and dihedral; these are obtained by fitting against detailed electronic calculations (quantum chemical simulations) or experimental physical properties such as [[Young's modulus|elastic constants]], lattice parameters and [[spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] measurements.

Because of the non-local nature of non-bonded interactions, they involve at least weak interactions between all particles in the system. Its calculation is normally the bottleneck in the speed of MD simulations. To lower the computational cost, [[Force field (chemistry)|force fields]] employ numerical approximations such as shifted cutoff radii, [[reaction field method|reaction field]] algorithms, particle mesh [[Ewald summation]], or the newer particle–particle-particle–mesh ([[P3M]]).

Chemistry force fields commonly employ preset bonding arrangements (an exception being ''[[ab initio quantum chemistry methods|ab initio]]'' dynamics), and thus are unable to model the process of chemical bond breaking and reactions explicitly. On the other hand, many of the potentials used in physics, such as those based on the [[bond order potential|bond order formalism]] can describe several different coordinations of a system and bond breaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Sinnott |first1= S.

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; can be considered a fully reactive hybrid between bond order potentials and chemistry force fields.

=== Pair potentials versus many-body potentials ===

The potential functions representing the non-bonded energy are formulated as a sum over interactions between the particles of the system. The simplest choice, employed in many popular [[force field (chemistry)|force fields]], is the "pair potential", in which the total potential energy can be calculated from the sum of energy contributions between pairs of atoms. An example of such a pair potential is the non-bonded [[Lennard–Jones potential]] (also termed the 6–12 potential), used for calculating van der Waals forces.

:&lt;math&gt;
U(r) = 4\varepsilon \left[ \left(\frac{\sigma}{r}\right)^{12} - \left(\frac{\sigma}{r}\right)^{6} \right]
&lt;/math&gt;

Another example is the Born (ionic) model of the ionic lattice. The first term in the next equation is [[Coulomb's law]] for a pair of ions, the second term is the short-range repulsion explained by Pauli's exclusion principle and the final term is the dispersion interaction term. Usually, a simulation only includes the dipolar term, although sometimes the quadrupolar term is also included.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/jp054304p |pmid=16375450 |author1=Cruz, F.J.A.L. |author2=Canongia Lopes, J.N. |author3=Calado, J.C.G. |author4=Minas da Piedade, M.E. |title=A Molecular Dynamics Study of the Thermodynamic Properties of Calcium Apatites. 1.

&lt;/math&gt;

In [[many body problem|many-body potentials]], the potential energy includes the effects of three or more particles interacting with each other.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Justo|first1=J.

In many-body potentials, the potential energy cannot be found by a sum over pairs of atoms, as these interactions are calculated explicitly as a combination of higher-order terms. In the statistical view, the dependency between the variables cannot in general be expressed using only pairwise products of the degrees of freedom. For example, the [[Tersoff potential]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

=== Semi-empirical potentials ===

[[Semi-empirical quantum chemistry methods|Semi-empirical]] potentials make use of the matrix representation from quantum mechanics. However, the values of the matrix elements are found through empirical formulae that estimate the degree of overlap of specific atomic orbitals. The matrix is then diagonalized to determine the occupancy of the different atomic orbitals, and empirical formulae are used once again to determine the energy contributions of the orbitals.

There are a wide variety of semi-empirical potentials, termed [[Tight binding (physics)|tight-binding]] potentials, which vary according to the atoms being modeled.

=== Polarizable potentials ===

{{Main|Force field (chemistry)|l1=Force field}}
Most classical force fields implicitly include the effect of [[polarizability]], e.g., by scaling up the partial charges obtained from quantum chemical calculations. These partial charges are stationary with respect to the mass of the atom. But molecular dynamics simulations can explicitly model polarizability with the introduction of induced dipoles through different methods, such as [[Drude particle]]s or fluctuating charges. This allows for a dynamic redistribution of charge between atoms which responds to the local chemical environment.

For many years, polarizable MD simulations have been touted as the next generation. For homogenous liquids such as water, increased accuracy has been achieved through the inclusion of polarizability.&lt;ref name="Lamoureux3"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lamoureux G, Harder E, Vorobyov IV, Roux B, MacKerell AD |year=2006 |title=A polarizable model of water for molecular dynamics simulations of biomolecules |journal=Chem Phys Lett |volume=418 |issue=1 |pages=245–249 |doi=10.1016/j.cplett.2005.10.135|bibcode= 2006CPL...418..245L |last2=Harder |last3=Vorobyov |last4=Roux |last5=MacKerell}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sokhan2015"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sokhan VP, Jones AP, Cipcigan FS, Crain J, Martyna GJ |year=2015 |title=Signature properties of water: Their molecular electronic origins |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=112 |issue=20 |pages=6341–6346 |doi= 10.1073/pnas.1418982112 |pmid=25941394 |pmc=4443379|bibcode=2015PNAS..112.6341S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cipcigan"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cipcigan FS, Sokhan VP, Jones AP, Crain J, Martyna GJ |year=2015 |title=Hydrogen bonding and molecular orientation at the liquid–vapour interface of water |journal=Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics |volume=17 |issue=14 |pages=8660–8669 |doi= 10.1039/C4CP05506C |pmid=25715668 |bibcode= 2015PCCP...17.8660C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some promising results have also been achieved for proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Protein−Nanoparticle Interactions: Opportunities and Challenges |journal=Chemical Reviews |date=2011 |volume=111 |issue=9 |pages=5610–37 |doi=10.1021/cr100440g |pmid=21688848 |last1=Mahmoudi |first1=Morteza |last2=Lynch |first2=Iseult |last3=Ejtehadi |first3=Mohammad Reza |last4=Monopoli |first4=Marco P. |last5=Bombelli |first5=Francesca Baldelli |last6=Laurent |first6=Sophie }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Patel2004b&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Patel, S. |author2=MacKerell, Jr. AD |author3=Brooks III, Charles L |year=2004 |title=CHARMM fluctuating charge force field for proteins: II protein/solvent properties from molecular dynamics simulations using a nonadditive electrostatic model |journal=J Comput Chem |volume=25 |pages=1504–1514 |doi=10.1002/jcc.20077 |pmid=15224394 |issue=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is still uncertain how to best approximate polarizability in a simulation.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

=== Potentials in ''ab initio'' methods ===
{{Main|Quantum chemistry|List of quantum chemistry and solid state physics software}}

In classical molecular dynamics, one potential energy surface (usually the ground state) is represented in the force field. This is a consequence of the [[Born–Oppenheimer approximation]]. In excited states, chemical reactions or when a more accurate representation is needed, electronic behavior can be obtained from first principles by using a quantum mechanical method, such as [[density functional theory]]. This is named Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics (AIMD). Due to the cost of treating the electronic degrees of freedom, the computational cost of these simulations is far higher than classical molecular dynamics. This implies that AIMD is limited to smaller systems and shorter times.

''[[Ab initio]]'' [[quantum mechanical]] and [[Quantum chemistry|chemical]] methods may be used to calculate the [[potential energy surface|potential energy]] of a system on the fly, as needed for conformations in a trajectory. This calculation is usually made in the close neighborhood of the [[reaction coordinate]]. Although various approximations may be used, these are based on theoretical considerations, not on empirical fitting. ''Ab initio'' calculations produce a vast amount of information that is not available from empirical methods, such as density of electronic states or other electronic properties. A significant advantage of using ''ab initio'' methods is the ability to study reactions that involve breaking or formation of covalent bonds, which correspond to multiple electronic states.

=== Hybrid QM/MM ===
{{Main|QM/MM}}
QM (quantum-mechanical) methods are very powerful. However, they are computationally expensive, while the MM (classical or molecular mechanics) methods are fast but suffer from several limits (require extensive parameterization; energy estimates obtained are not very accurate; cannot be used to simulate reactions where covalent bonds are broken/formed; and are limited in their abilities for providing accurate details regarding the chemical environment). A new class of method has emerged that combines the good points of QM (accuracy) and MM (speed) calculations. These methods are termed mixed or hybrid quantum-mechanical and molecular mechanics methods (hybrid QM/MM).&lt;ref&gt;The methodology for such methods was introduced by Warshel and coworkers. In the recent years have been pioneered by several groups including: [[Arieh Warshel]] ([[University of Southern California]]), Weitao Yang ([[Duke University]]), Sharon Hammes-Schiffer ([[The Pennsylvania State University]]), Donald Truhlar and Jiali Gao ([[University of Minnesota]]) and Kenneth Merz ([[University of Florida]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important advantage of hybrid QM/MM method is the speed. The cost of doing classical molecular dynamics (MM) in the most straightforward case scales O(n&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), where n is the number of atoms in the system. This is mainly due to electrostatic interactions term (every particle interacts with every other particle). However, use of cutoff radius, periodic pair-list updates and more recently the variations of the particle-mesh Ewald's (PME) method has reduced this to between O(n) to O(n&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). In other words, if a system with twice as many atoms is simulated then it would take between two and four times as much computing power. On the other hand, the simplest ''ab initio'' calculations typically scale O(n&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) or worse (restricted [[Hartree–Fock]] calculations have been suggested to scale ~O(n&lt;sup&gt;2.7&lt;/sup&gt;)). To overcome the limit, a small part of the system is treated quantum-mechanically (typically active-site of an enzyme) and the remaining system is treated classically.

In more sophisticated implementations, QM/MM methods exist to treat both light nuclei susceptible to quantum effects (such as hydrogens) and electronic states. This allows generating hydrogen wave-functions (similar to electronic wave-functions). This methodology has been useful in investigating phenomena such as hydrogen tunneling. One example where QM/MM methods have provided new discoveries is the calculation of hydride transfer in the enzyme liver [[alcohol dehydrogenase]]. In this case, [[quantum tunneling]] is important for the hydrogen, as it determines the reaction rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

=== Coarse-graining and reduced representations ===

At the other end of the detail scale are [[Coarse-grained modeling|coarse-grained]] and lattice models. Instead of explicitly representing every atom of the system, one uses "pseudo-atoms" to represent groups of atoms. MD simulations on very large systems may require such large computer resources that they cannot easily be studied by traditional all-atom methods. Similarly, simulations of processes on long timescales (beyond about 1 microsecond) are prohibitively expensive, because they require so many time steps. In these cases, one can sometimes tackle the problem by using reduced representations, which are also called [[Coarse-grained modeling|coarse-grained models]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kmiecik|first=Sebastian|last2=Gront|first2=Dominik|last3=Kolinski|first3=Michal|last4=Wieteska|first4=Lukasz|last5=Dawid|first5=Aleksandra Elzbieta|last6=Kolinski|first6=Andrzej|date=2016-06-22|title=Coarse-Grained Protein Models and Their Applications|journal=Chemical Reviews|doi=10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00163|issn=0009-2665|pmid=27333362|volume=116|issue=14|pages=7898–936}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The parameterization of these very [[Coarse-grained modeling|coarse-grained models]] must be done empirically, by matching the behavior of the model to appropriate experimental data or all-atom simulations. Ideally, these parameters should account for both [[enthalpy|enthalpic]] and [[entropy|entropic]] contributions to free energy in an implicit way. When coarse-graining is done at higher levels, the accuracy of the dynamic description may be less reliable. But very [[Coarse-grained modeling|coarse-grained models]] have been used successfully to examine a wide range of questions in structural biology, liquid crystal organization, and polymer glasses.

* [[Supercoiling|DNA supercoiling]] has been investigated using 1–3 pseudo-atoms per basepair, and at even lower resolution;
* Packaging of [[DNA|double-helical DNA]] into [[bacteriophage]] has been investigated with models where one pseudo-atom represents one turn (about 10 basepairs) of the double helix;
* RNA structure in the [[ribosome]] and other large systems has been modeled with one pseudo-atom per nucleotide.

The simplest form of coarse-graining is the ''united atom'' (sometimes called ''extended atom'') and was used in most early MD simulations of proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. For example, instead of treating all four atoms of a CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; methyl group explicitly (or all three atoms of CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; methylene group), one represents the whole group with one pseudo-atom. It must, of course, be properly parameterized so that its van der Waals interactions with other groups have the proper distance-dependence. Similar considerations apply to the bonds, angles, and torsions in which the pseudo-atom participates. In this kind of united atom representation, one typically eliminates all explicit hydrogen atoms except those that have the capability to participate in hydrogen bonds (''polar hydrogens''). An example of this is the [[CHARMM]] 19 force-field.

The polar hydrogens are usually retained in the model, because proper treatment of hydrogen bonds requires a reasonably accurate description of the directionality and the electrostatic interactions between the donor and acceptor groups. A hydroxyl group, for example, can be both a hydrogen bond donor, and a hydrogen bond acceptor, and it would be impossible to treat this with one OH pseudo-atom. About half the atoms in a protein or nucleic acid are non-polar hydrogens, so the use of united atoms can provide a substantial savings in computer time.

== Incorporating solvent effects ==
In many simulations of a solute-solvent system the main focus is on the behavior of the solute with little interest of the solvent behavior particularly in those solvent molecules residing in regions far from the solute molecule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Molecular Modelling: Principles and Applications|last=Leach|first=Dr Andrew|date=30 January 2001|publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=9780582382107|edition= 2nd|location=Harlow|language=English|id= {{ASIN|0582382106|country=uk}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solvents may influence the dynamic behavior of solutes via random collisions and by imposing a frictional drag on the motion of the solute through the solvent. The use of non-rectangular periodic boundary conditions, stochastic boundaries and solvent shells can all help reduce the number of solvent molecules required and enable a larger proportion of the computing time to be spent instead on simulating the solute. It is also possible to incorporate the effects of a solvent without needing any explicit solvent molecules present. One example of this approach is to use a [[Potential of mean force|potential mean force]] (PMF) which describes how the free energy changes as a particular coordinate is varied. The free energy change described by PMF contains the averaged effects of the solvent.

== Long-range forces ==
A long range interaction is an interaction in which the spatial interaction falls off no faster than &lt;math&gt;r^{-d}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is the dimensionality of the system. Examples include charge-charge interactions between ions and dipole-dipole interactions between molecules. Modelling these forces presents quite a challenge as they are significant over a distance which may be larger than half the box length with simulations of many thousands of particles. Though one solution would be to significantly increase the size of the box length, this brute force approach is less than ideal as the simulation would become computationally very expensive. Spherically truncating the potential is also out of the question as unrealistic behaviour may be observed when the distance is close to the cut off distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Computer Simulation of Liquids|last=Allen|first=Michael P.|last2=Tildesley|first2=Dominic J.|date=2017-08-22|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780198803201|edition= 2nd|location=|pages=216|language=English|id= {{ASIN|0198803206|country=uk}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Steered molecular dynamics (SMD) ==

Steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations, or force probe simulations, apply forces to a protein in order to manipulate its structure by pulling it along desired degrees of freedom. These experiments can be used to reveal structural changes in a protein at the atomic level. SMD is often used to simulate events such as mechanical unfolding or stretching.&lt;ref name="Nienhaus"&gt;{{cite book |title=Protein-ligand interactions: methods and applications |author=Nienhaus, Gerd Ulrich |year=2005 |pages=54–56 |isbn=978-1-61737-525-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two typical protocols of SMD: one in which pulling velocity is held constant, and one in which applied force is constant. Typically, part of the studied system (e.g., an atom in a protein) is restrained by a harmonic potential. Forces are then applied to specific atoms at either a constant velocity or a constant force. [[Umbrella sampling]] is used to move the system along the desired reaction coordinate by varying, for example, the forces, distances, and angles manipulated in the simulation. Through umbrella sampling, all of the system's configurations—both high-energy and low-energy—are adequately sampled. Then, each configuration's change in free energy can be calculated as the [[potential of mean force]].&lt;ref name="Leszczyński"&gt;{{cite book |title=Computational chemistry: reviews of current trends, Volume 9 |author=Leszczyński, Jerzy |year=2005 |pages=54–56 |isbn=978-981-256-742-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; A popular method of computing PMF is through the weighted histogram analysis method (WHAM), which analyzes a series of umbrella sampling simulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kumar|first=Shankar|author2=Rosenberg, John M. |author3=Bouzida, Djamal |author4=Swendsen, Robert H. |author5=Kollman, Peter A. |title=The weighted histogram analysis method for free-energy calculations on biomolecules.

The following biophysical examples illustrate notable efforts to produce simulations of a systems of very large size (a complete virus) or very long simulation times (up to 1.112 milliseconds):
* MD simulation of the full ''[[satellite tobacco mosaic virus]]'' (STMV) (2006, Size: 1 million atoms, Simulation time: 50 ns, program: [[NAMD]]) This virus is a small, icosahedral plant virus that worsens the symptoms of infection by Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV). Molecular dynamics simulations were used to probe the mechanisms of [[Virus#Structure|viral assembly]]. The entire STMV particle consists of 60 identical copies of one protein that make up the viral [[capsid]] (coating), and a 1063 nucleotide single stranded RNA [[genome]]. One key finding is that the capsid is very unstable when there is no RNA inside. The simulation would take one 2006 desktop computer around 35 years to complete. It was thus done in many processors in parallel with continuous communication between them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/STMV/ |title=Molecular dynamics simulation of the Satellite Tobacco Mosaic Virus (STMV) |vauthors=Freddolino P, Arkhipov A, Larson SB, McPherson A, Schulten K |work=Theoretical and Computational Biophysics Group |publisher=University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Folding simulations of the [[Villin]] Headpiece in all-atom detail (2006, Size: 20,000 atoms; Simulation time: 500 µs= 500,000 ns, Program: [[Folding@home]]) This simulation was run in 200,000 CPU's of participating personal computers around the world. These computers had the Folding@home program installed, a large-scale distributed computing effort coordinated by [[Vijay Pande]] at Stanford University. The kinetic properties of the Villin Headpiece protein were probed by using many independent, short trajectories run by CPU's without continuous real-time communication. One method employed was the Pfold value analysis, which measures the probability of folding before unfolding of a specific starting conformation. Pfold gives information about [[Phi value analysis|transition state]] structures and an ordering of conformations along the [[Protein folding|folding pathway]]. Each trajectory in a Pfold calculation can be relatively short, but many independent trajectories are needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jayachandran|first1=Guha|last2=Vishal|first2=V.|last3=Pande|first3=Vijay S.|title=Using massively parallel simulation and Markovian models to study protein folding: Examining the dynamics of the villin headpiece|journal=The Journal of Chemical Physics|date=28 April 2006|volume=124|issue=16|pages=164902|doi=10.1063/1.2186317|pmid=16674165|bibcode=2006JChPh.124p4902J}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The longest published result of a simulation performed using Anton is a 1.112-millisecond simulation of NTL9 at 355 K; a second, independent 1.073-millisecond simulation of this configuration was also performed (and many other simulations of over 250 µs continuous chemical time).&lt;ref name="DESRES-Science2011"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Lindorff-Larsen |first1= Kresten |last2= Piana |first2= Stefano |last3= Dror |first3= Ron O. |last4= Shaw |first4= David E. |year= 2011 |title= How Fast-Folding Proteins Fold |url= |journal= Science |volume= 334 |issue= 6055 |pages= 517–520 |doi=10.1126/science.1208351 |pmid= 22034434 |bibcode= 2011Sci...334..517L|citeseerx= 10.1.1.1013.9290 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''How Fast-Folding Proteins Fold'', researchers Kresten Lindorff-Larsen, Stefano Piana, Ron O.

}}'''Johann Adam Otto Bütschli''' (3 May 1848 – 2 February 1920) was a [[Germany|German]] [[zoologist]] and [[professor]] at the [[University of Heidelberg]]. He specialized in [[invertebrate]]s and [[insect]] [[developmental biology|development]]. Many of the groups of [[protist]]s were first recognized by him.

==Life==

Bütschli was born [[Frankfurt|Frankfurt am Main]]. He studied [[mineralogy]], [[chemistry]], and [[paleontology]] in [[Karlsruhe]] and became assistant of [[Karl Alfred von Zittel]] ([[geology]] and paleontology). He moved to [[Heidelberg]] in 1866 and worked with [[Robert Bunsen]] (chemistry). He received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] from the [[University of Heidelberg]] in 1868, after passing examinations in geology, paleontology, and [[zoology]]. He joined [[Rudolf Leuckart]] at the [[University of Leipzig]] in 1869. After leaving his studies to serve as an officer in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] (1870-1871), Bütschli worked in his private laboratory and then for two years (1873-1874) with [[Karl Möbius]] at the [[University of Kiel]]. After that, he worked privately. In 1876, he made [[Habilitation]]. He became professor at the [[University of Heidelberg]], as successor of [[Alexander Pagenstecher (zoologist)|Alexander Pagenstecher]], in 1878. He held this position for over 40 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://protistology.ifmo.ru/num8_1/fokin_protistology_8-1.pdf |title=Protistology|last=Fokin|first=Sergei I.|date=2013|accessdate=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Philosophy of Time Society''' is an organization which grew out of a [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] Summer Seminar on the [[Philosophy of space and time|Philosophy of Time]] offered by [[George N. Schlesinger]] in 1991.&lt;ref name="nottingham1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/philtimesoc/intro.aspx |title=Welcome to the Philosophy of Time Society – The University of Nottingham |publisher=Nottingham.ac.uk |accessdate=November 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The organization itself was formed in 1993.&lt;ref name="nottingham1"/&gt;  Its stated goal is "to promote the study of the philosophy of time from a broad [[Analytic philosophy|analytic perspective]], and to provide a forum as an affiliated group with the [[American Philosophical Association]], to discuss the issues in and related to the philosophy of time."&lt;ref name="nottingham1"/&gt;

The Philosophy of Time Society's meetings are held at the meetings of the [[American Philosophical Association]].

'''Point-defence''' (or '''point-defense'''; see [[American and British English spelling differences|spelling differences]]) is the  defence of a single object or a limited area, e.g. a ship, building or an airfield, now usually against air attacks and [[guided missile]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=First Strike!: The Pentagon's Strategy for Nuclear War |last=Aldridge |first=Robert C. |year=1983 |publisher=[[South End Press]] |isbn=978-0-89608-154-3 |page=192}}&lt;/ref&gt; Point-defence weapons have a smaller range in contrast to [[area-defence]] systems and are placed near or on the object to be protected.

Point-defence may include:
* short-ranged [[interceptor aircraft]]
* [[Close-in weapon system]]s on ships
* land-based short-ranged [[anti-aircraft]] guns or [[surface-to-air missile]] systems
* [[Active protection system]]s on tanks or other armoured fighting vehicles

[[Coastal artillery]] to protect harbours is similar conceptually, but is generally not classified as point-defence. Similarly, passive systems—[[electronic countermeasures]], decoys, [[Chaff (radar countermeasure)|chaff]], [[flare]]s, [[barrage balloon]]s—are not considered point-defence.

== Examples ==
* [[Bachem Ba 349]] ''Natter'' – vertical take-off rocket powered manned interceptor (prototypes only)
* [[Messerschmitt Me 163]] – World War II era German rocket powered [[interceptor aircraft|interceptor]].
* [[Goalkeeper CIWS]] – Gun [[CIWS]] in current service by the Dutch navy.
* [[Kashtan CIWS]] – Gun-Missile CIWS in current service by the Russian navy.
* [[RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile|RIM-116 RAM]] – Missile CIWS in current use by the US Navy.
* [[Type 730]] – in current use by the Chinese Navy.
* [[Arena active protection system|Arena APS]] – a Russian point defence system for individual armoured vehicles.

Cellular proteostasis is key to ensuring successful development, healthy [[aging]], resistance to [[environmental stresses]], and to minimize homeostasis perturbations by pathogens such as [[viruses]].&lt;ref name = Blach/&gt; Mechanisms by which proteostasis is ensured include regulated protein translation, chaperone assisted protein folding and protein degradation pathways. Adjusting each of these mechanisms to the demand for proteins is essential to maintain all cellular functions relying on a correctly folded [[proteome]].

== Mechanisms of proteostasis ==

===The roles of the ribosome in proteostasis ===

One of the first points of regulation for proteostasis is during [[translation]]. This is accomplished via the structure of the [[ribosome]], a complex central to translation. These two characteristics shape the way the protein folds and influences the proteins future interactions. The synthesis of a new [[peptide]] chain using the ribosome is very slow and the ribosome can even be stalled when it encounters a [[Genetic code|rare codon]], a codon found at low concentrations in the cell.&lt;ref name =Cavagnero&gt;{{cite journal | pmid=21370971|author1=Cavagnero, S.  |author2=Fedyukina, D. V. |lastauthoramp=yes | title=Protein Folding at the Exit Tunnel| journal=Annual Review of Biophysics  | volume=40 | date=March 2011 |pages=337–359 | doi=10.1146/annurev-biophys-042910-155338}}&lt;/ref&gt; These pauses provide an opportunity for an individual [[protein domain]] to have the necessary time to become folded before the production of following domains. This facilitates the correct folding of multi-domain proteins.&lt;ref name = Cavagnero/&gt;
The newly synthesized peptide chain exits the ribosome into the cellular environment through the narrow [[Eukaryotic Ribosome (80S)#Protein Translocation and Targeting|ribosome exit channel]] (width: 10Å to 20Å, length 80Å).&lt;ref name = Cavagnero/&gt; Due to space restriction in the exit channel the nascent chain already forms [[Protein secondary structure|secondary]] and limited [[Biomolecular structure#Tertiary structure|tertiary]] structures. For example, an [[alpha helix]] is one such structural property that is commonly induced in this exit channel.&lt;ref name =Bustamante&gt;{{cite journal | pmid=24895851| author= Bustamante, C. J., et.al. | title=Mechanisms of Cellular Proteostasis: Insights from Single-Molecule Approaches| journal=Annual Review of Biophysics  | volume=43 | date=2014 |pages=119–140 | doi=10.1146/annurev-biophys-051013-022811 | pmc=4620553}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time the exit channel also prevents premature folding by impeding large scale interactions within the peptide chain which would require more space.

=== Molecular chaperones and post-translational maintenance in proteostasis ===

In order to maintain protein homeostasis post-translationally, the cell makes use of [[Chaperone (protein)|molecular chaperones]] sometimes including [[chaperonin]]s, which aid in the assembly or disassembly of proteins.&lt;ref name =Ye&gt;{{cite journal | pmid=23746257| author= Ye, K., et.al.| title=Molecular Chaperone Functions in Protein Folding and Proteostasis| journal=Annual Review of Biophysics | volume=82 | date=2013 |pages=323–355 | doi=10.1146/annurev-biochem-060208-092442}}&lt;/ref&gt; They recognize exposed segments of [[Amino acid#Physicochemical properties of amino acids|hydrophobic amino acids]] in the nascent peptide chain and then work to promote the proper formation of [[Non-covalent interactions|noncovalent interactions]] that lead to the desired folded state.&lt;ref name = Ye/&gt; 
Chaperones begin to assist in protein folding as soon as a nascent chain longer than 60 amino acids emerges from the ribosome exit channel.&lt;ref name =Vabulas&gt;{{cite journal | pmid=21123396| author= Vabulas, M. R. et. al.| title=Protein Folding in the Cytoplasm and the Heat Shock Response| journal=Cold Spring Harb Perspect Biol | volume=2 | date=2010 |pages=1–18 | doi=10.1101/cshperspect.a004390 | pmc=2982175}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the most studied ribosome binding chaperones is trigger factor. Trigger factor works to stabilize the peptide, promotes its folding, prevents aggregation, and promotes refolding of denatured model substrates.&lt;ref name =Hoffman&gt;{{cite journal | pmid=20132842| author= Hoffman, A.| title=Structure and function of the molecular chaperone Trigger Factor| journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Molecular Cell Research| volume=1803 | date=June 2010 |pages=650–661 | doi=10.1016/j.bbamcr.2010.01.017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trigger factor not only directly works to properly fold the protein but also recruits other chaperones to the ribosome, such as Hsp70. Hsp70 surrounds an unfolded peptide chain, thereby preventing aggregation and promoting folding.&lt;ref name = Ye/&gt;&lt;ref name = Vabulas/&gt;

Chaperonins are a special class of chaperones that promote native state folding by cyclically encapsulating the peptide chain.&lt;ref name = Vabulas/&gt; Chaperonins are divided into two groups. [[Chaperonin#Categories of chaperonins|Group 1]] chaperonins are commonly found in bacteria, chloroplasts, and mitochondria. [[Chaperonin#Categories of chaperonins|Group 2]] chaperonins are found in both the cytosol of eukaryotic cells as well as in archaea.&lt;ref name =Yébenes&gt;{{cite journal | pmid=21723731| author= Yébenes, H., et. al. | title=Chaperonins: two rings for folding| journal=Trends Biochem Sci | volume=36 | date=Aug 2011 |pages=424–432 | doi=10.1016/j.tibs.2011.05.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Group 2 chaperonins also contain an additional helical component which acts as a lid for the cylindrical protein chamber, unlike Group 1 which instead relies on an extra cochaperone to act as a lid. All chaperonins exhibit two states (open and closed), between which they can cycle. This cycling process is important during the folding of an individual polypeptide chain as it helps to avoid undesired interactions as well as to prevent the peptide from entering into kinetically trapped states.&lt;ref name = Yébenes/&gt;

=== Regulating proteostasis by protein degradation ===

The third component of the proteostasis network is the protein degradation machinery. Protein degradation occurs in proteostasis when the cellular signals indicate the need to decrease overall cellular protein levels. The effects of protein degradation can be local, with the cell only experiencing effects from the loss of the degraded protein itself or widespread, with the entire protein landscape changing due to loss of other proteins’ interactions with the degraded protein.&lt;ref name = Bustamante/&gt; Multiple substrates are targets for proteostatic degradation. These degradable substrates include nonfunctional protein fragments produced from ribosomal stalling during translation, misfolded or unfolded proteins, aggregated proteins, and proteins that are no longer needed to carry out cellular function. Several different pathways exist for carrying out these degradation processes. When proteins are determined to be unfolded or misfolded, they are typically degraded via the [[unfolded protein response]] (UPR) or [[endoplasmic-reticulum-associated protein degradation]] (ERAD). Substrates that are unfolded, misfolded, or no longer required for cellular function can also be [[ubiquitin]] tagged for degradation by ATP dependent proteases, such as the [[proteasome]] in eukaryotes or ClpXP in prokaryotes. [[Autophagy]], or self engulfment, lysosomal targeting, and [[phagocytosis]] (engulfment of waste products by other cells) can also be used as proteostatic degradation mechanisms.&lt;ref name = Bustamante/&gt;

== Signaling events in proteostasis ==

Protein misfolding is detected by mechanisms that are specific for the cellular compartment in which they occur. Distinct surveillance mechanisms that respond unfolded protein have been characterized in the cytoplasm, ER and mitochondria. This response acts locally in a cell autonomous fashion but can also extend to intercellular signaling to protect the organism from anticipated proteotoxic stress.

=== Cell-autonomous stress responses ===

Cellular stress response pathways detect and alleviate proteotoxic stress which is triggered by imbalances in proteostasis. The cell-autonomous regulation occurs through direct detection of  misfolded proteins or inhibition of pathway activation by sequestering activating components in response to heat shock. Cellular responses to this stress signaling include transcriptional activation of chaperone expression, increased efficiency in protein trafficking and protein degradation and translational reduction.
[[File:Stress signaling.png|thumb|Proteostasis stress signaling response]]

=== Cytosolic heat shock response ===

The cytosolic HSR is mainly mediated by the transcription factor family HSF (heat shock family). HSF is constitutively bound by Hsp90. Upon a proteotoxic stimulus Hsp90 is recruited away from HSF which can then bind to heat response elements in the DNA and upregulate gene expression of proteins involved in the maintenance of proteostasis.

=== ER unfolded protein response ===

The unfolded protein response in the [[endoplasmatic reticulum]] (ER) is activated by imbalances of unfolded proteins inside the ER and the proteins mediating protein homeostasis. Different “detectors” - such as IRE1, ATF6 and PERK - can recognize misfolded proteins in the ER and mediate transcriptional responses which help alleviate the effects of ER stress.

=== Mitochondrial unfolded protein response ===

The mitochondrial unfolded protein response detects imbalances in protein stoichiometry of mitochondrial proteins and misfolded proteins. The expression of mitochondrial chaperones is upregulated by the activation of the transcription factors ATF-1 and/or DVE-1 with UBL-5.

=== Systemic stress signaling ===

Stress responses can also be triggered in a non-cell autonomous fashion by intercellular communication. The stress that is sensed in one tissue could thereby be communicated to other tissues to protect the proteome of the organism or to regulate proteostasis systemically. Cell non-autonomous activation can occur for all three stress responses.

Work on the model organism ''C. elegans'' has shown that neurons play a role in this intercellular communication of cytosolic HSR. Stress induced in the neurons of the worm can in the long run protect other tissues such as muscle and intestinal cells from chronic [[proteotoxicity]]. Similarly ER and mitochondrial UPR in neurons are relayed to intestinal cells . These systemic responses have been implicated in mediating not only systemic proteostasis but also influence organismal aging.&lt;ref name =Taylor&gt;{{cite journal | pmid=24556842 |vauthors=Taylor RC, etal | title=Systemic stress signalling: understanding the cell non-autonomous control of proteostasis| journal=Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology| volume=15 | date=2014 |pages=506–14 | doi=10.1038/nrm3752}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diseases of proteostasis ==

=== Proteostasis and diseases of protein folding ===
Dysfunction in proteostasis can arise from errors in or misregulation of protein folding. The classic examples are missense mutations and deletions that change the thermodynamic and kinetic parameters for the protein folding process.&lt;ref name = Powers/&gt; These mutations are often inherited and range in phenotypic severity from having no noticeable effect to embryonic lethality. Disease develops when these mutations render a protein significantly more susceptible to misfolding, aggregation, and degradation. If these effects only alter the mutated protein, the negative consequences will only be local loss of function. However, if these mutations occur in a chaperone or a protein that interacts with many other proteins, dramatic global alterations in the proteostasis boundary will occur. Examples of diseases resulting from proteostatic changes from errors in protein folding include cystic fibrosis, Huntington’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, lysosomal storage disorders, and others.&lt;ref name =Hipp&gt;{{cite journal | pmid=24946960 |vauthors=Hipp MS, etal | title=Proteostasis impairment in protein-misfolding and aggregation diseases| journal=Trends Cell Biol.| volume=24 | date=2014 |pages=211–217 | doi=10.1016/j.tcb.2014.05.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The role of model systems in the elucidation of protein-misfolding diseases ===
Small animal model systems have been and continue to be instrumental in the identification of functional mechanisms that safeguard proteostasis. Model systems of diverse misfolding-prone disease proteins have so far revealed numerous chaperone and co-chaperone modifiers of [[proteotoxicity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Brehme M, Voisine C | title=Model systems of protein-misfolding diseases reveal chaperone modifiers of proteotoxicity| journal=Dis Model Mech.| volume=9 | date=2016 | pmid= 27491084 | doi=10.1242/dmm.024703 | pmc=5007983 | pages=823–838}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Proteostasis and cancer ===

The unregulated cell division that marks cancer development requires increased protein synthesis for cancer cell function and survival. This increased protein synthesis is typically seen in proteins that modulate cell metabolism and growth processes. Cancer cells are sometimes susceptible to drugs that inhibit chaperones and disrupt proteostasis, such as [[Hsp90 inhibitors]] or [[proteasome inhibitor]]s.&lt;ref name = Powers/&gt; Furthermore, cancer cells tend to produce misfolded proteins, which are removed mainly by proteolysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 27448843 | doi=10.1016/j.biocel.2016.07.019 | volume=79 | title=The ubiquitin-proteasome system and autophagy: Coordinated and independent activities | journal=Int J Biochem Cell Biol | pages=403–418 | author=Cohen-Kaplan V, Livneh I, Avni N, Cohen-Rosenzweig C, Ciechanover A}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inhibitors of proteolysis allow accumulation of both misfolded protein aggregates, as well as apoptosis signaling proteins in cancer cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 26523494 | doi=10.1586/14737140.2015.1095095 | volume=15 | title=Drugs acting on homeostasis: challenging cancer cell adaptation | year=2015 | journal=Expert Rev Anticancer Ther | pages=1405–17 | author=Moschovi M, Critselis E, Cen O, Adamaki M, Lambrou GI, Chrousos GP, Vlahopoulos S}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 26405162 | doi=10.18632/oncotarget.5492 | volume=6 | title=Regulation of Bim in Health and Disease | pmc=4695108 | journal=Oncotarget | pages=23058–134 | author=Sionov RV, Vlahopoulos SA, Granot Z}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can can change the sensitivity of cancer cells to antineoplastic drugs; cancer cells either die at a lower drug concentration, or survive, depending on the type of proteins that accumulate, and the function these proteins have.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 22273806 | doi=10.1016/j.mce.2012.01.003 | volume=351 | title=Glucocorticoid and proteasome inhibitor impact on the leukemic lymphoblast: multiple, diverse signals converging on a few key downstream regulators | date=April 2012 | journal=Mol.

=== Proteostasis and obesity ===

A hallmark of cellular proteostatic networks is their ability to adapt to stress via protein regulation. Metabolic disease, such as that associated with obesity, alters the ability of cellular proteostasis networks adapt to stress, often with detrimental health effects. For example, when insulin production exceeds the cell’s insulin secretion capacity, proteostatic collapse occurs and chaperone production is severely impaired. This disruption leads to the disease symptoms exhibited in individuals with diabetes.&lt;ref name = Powers/&gt;

=== Proteostasis and aging ===

Over time, the proteostasis network becomes burdened with proteins modified by reactive oxygen species and metabolites that induce oxidative damage.&lt;ref name = Powers/&gt; These byproducts can react with cellular proteins to cause misfolding and aggregation (especially in nondividing cells like neurons). This risk is particularly high for intrinsically disordered proteins. The IGFR-1 pathway has been shown in ''C. elegans'' to protect against these harmful aggregates, and some experimental work has suggested that upregulation of insulin growth factor receptor 1 (IGFR-1) may stabilize proteostatic network and prevent detrimental effects of aging.&lt;ref name = Powers/&gt; Expression of the [[chaperome]], the ensemble of chaperones and co-chaperones that interact in a complex network of molecular folding machines to regulate proteome function, is dramatically repressed in human aging brains and in the brains of patients with neurodegenerative diseases. Functional assays in ''C. elegans'' and human cells have identified a conserved [[chaperome]] sub-network of 16 chaperone genes, corresponding to 28 human orthologs as a proteostasis safeguard in aging and age-onset neurodegenerative disease.
&lt;ref name =Brehme&gt;{{cite journal | pmid= 25437566 |vauthors=Brehme M, etal | title=A conserved chaperome sub-network safeguards protein homeostasis in aging and neurodegenerative disease| journal=Cell Rep.| volume=9 | date=2014 |pages=1135–1150 | doi=10.1016/j.celrep.2014.09.042 | pmc=4255334}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pharmacologic intervention in proteostasis ===

There are two main approaches that have been used for therapeutic development targeting the proteostatic network: pharmacologic chaperones and proteostasis regulators. The principle behind designing pharmacologic chaperones for intervention in diseases of proteostasis is to design small molecules that stabilize proteins exhibiting borderline stability. Previously, this approach has been used to target and stabilize G-protein coupled receptors, neurotransmitter receptors, glycosidases, lysosomal storage proteins, and the mutant CFTR protein that causes cystic fibrosis and transthyretin, which can misfiled and aggregate leading to amyloidoses.&lt;ref name = Powers/&gt; Vertex Pharmaceuticals and Pfizer sell regulatory agency approved pharmacologic chaperones for ameliorating cystic fibrosis and the transthyretin amyloidoses, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bulawa C.E., Connelly S., DeVit M., Wang L. Weigel, Fleming J. Packman, Powers E.T., Wiseman R.L., Foss T.R., Wilson I.A., Kelly J.W., Labaudiniere R. | year = 2012 | title = Tafamidis, A Potent and Selective Transthyretin Kinetic Stabilizer That Inhibits the Amyloid Cascade | url = | journal = Proc.

Sci. | volume = 109 | issue = | pages = 9629–9634 | doi=10.1073/pnas.1121005109| pmc = 3386102}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amicus sells a regulatory agency approved pharmacologic chaperone for Fabry disease–a lysosomal storage disease.
      	
The principle behind proteostasis regulators is different, these molecules alter the biology of protein folding and / or degradation by altering the stoichiometry of the proteostasis network components in a given sub cellular compartment. For example, some proteostasis regulators initiate stress responsive signaling, such as the unfolded protein response, which transcriptionally reprograms the endoplasmic reticulum proteostasis network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Plate L., Cooley C.B., Chen J.J., Paxman R.J., Gallagher C.M., Madoux F., Genereux J.C., Dobbs W., Garza D., Spicer T.P., Scampavia L., Brown S.J., Rosen H., Powers E.T., Walter P., Hodder P., Wiseman R.L., Kelly J.W. | year = 2016 | title = Small Molecule Proteostasis Regulators that Reprogram the ER to Reduce Extracellular Protein Aggregation | url = | journal = eLife | volume = 5 | issue = | page = 15550 | doi=10.7554/elife.15550}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that this approach could even be applied prophylactically, such as upregulating certain protective pathways before experiencing an anticipated severe cellular stress. One theoretical mechanism for this approach includes upregulating the heat shock response response to rescue proteins from degradation during cellular stress.&lt;ref name = Powers /&gt;

[http://www.rcreee.org The Regional Center for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency (RCREEE]) is an intergovernmental organization with diplomatic status that aims to enable and increase the adoption of renewable energy and energy efficiency practices in the Arab region. RCREEE teams with regional governments and global organizations to initiate and lead clean energy policy dialogues, strategies, technologies and capacity development in order to increase Arab states’ share of tomorrow’s energy.

Through its solid alliance with the [[League of Arab States]], RCREEE is committed to tackle each country’s specific needs and objectives through collaborating with Arab policy makers, businesses, international organizations and academic communities in key work areas: capacity development and learning, policies and regulations, research and statistics, and technical assistance.  The center is also involved in various local and regional projects and initiatives that are tailored to specific objectives.

Having today 17 Arab countries among its members  ([[Algeria]], [[Bahrain]], [[Djibouti]], [[Egypt]], [[Iraq]], [[Jordan]], [[Kuwait]], [[Lebanon]], [[Libya]], [[Mauritania]] [[Morocco]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], [[Somalia]] [[Sudan]], [[Syria]], [[Tunisia]], and [[Yemen]]), RCREEE strives to lead renewable energy and energy efficiency initiatives and expertise in all Arab states based on five core strategic impact areas: facts and figures, policies, people, institutions, and finance.

RCREEE is financed through its member state contributions, government grants provided by Germany through the [[Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit|German Development Cooperation (GIZ) GmbH]] [https://www.giz.de/en/worldwide/16275.html (link)], Denmark through the [[Danish International Development Agency|Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA)]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20160303225605/http://um.dk/en/danida-en/activities/business/contracts/long/contracts-awarded-by-danida2/awarded/ (link)], and Egypt through the [http://www.nrea.gov.eg/english1.html New and Renewable Energy Authority (NREA)] [http://www.nrea.gov.eg/annual%20report/annual2010En.pdf (link)]. RCREEE is also financed through selected fee-for-service contracts.

'''History'''

RCREEE was set up based on Cairo Declaration which was signed in June, 2008 by government representatives from ten Arab countries. The declaration outlined the following two core objectives for establishing the center:
# To diffuse the implementation of cost-effective renewable energy and energy efficiency policies, strategies and technologies in the Arab region.
# To increase the share of renewable energy and energy efficiency products and services in the Arab region and their share of global market.
RCREEE acquired its legal status in August, 2010 as an independent not-for-profit international organization through a Host Country Agreement with the government of Egypt.

In [[mathematics]], a '''rigid''' collection ''C'' of mathematical objects (for instance sets or functions) is one in which every ''c''&amp;nbsp;[[∈]]&amp;nbsp;''C'' is uniquely determined by less information about ''c'' than one would expect.

The above statement does not define a mathematical property.  Instead, it describes in what sense the adjective rigid is typically used in mathematics, by mathematicians.

Some examples include:
#[[Harmonic function]]s on the unit disk are rigid in the sense that they are uniquely determined by their boundary values.
#[[Holomorphic functions]] are determined by the set of all derivatives at a single point. A smooth function from the real line to the complex plane is not,  in general, determined by all its derivatives at a single point, but it is if we require additionally that it be possible to extend the function to one on a neighbourhood of the real line in the complex plane. The [[Schwarz lemma]] is an example of such a rigidity theorem.
#By the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]], [[polynomial]]s in '''C''' are rigid in the sense that any polynomial is completely determined by its values on any [[infinite set]], say '''N''', or the [[unit disk]]. By the previous example, a polynomial is also determined within the set of holomorphic functions by the finite set of its non-zero derivatives at any single point. 
#Linear maps '''L'''(''X'',&amp;nbsp;''Y'') between vector spaces ''X'',&amp;nbsp;''Y'' are rigid in the sense that any '''L''' ∈ '''L'''(''X'',&amp;nbsp;''Y'') is completely determined by its values on any set of [[basis vector]]s of ''X''.
#[[Mostow's rigidity theorem]], which states that the geometric structure of negatively curved manifolds is determined by their topological structure.
#A [[well-ordered set]] is rigid in the sense that the only ([[order-preserving]]) [[automorphism]] on it is the identity function.  Consequently, an [[isomorphism]] between two given well-ordered sets will be unique.
#[[Cauchy's theorem (geometry)|Cauchy's theorem]] on geometry of [[convex polytope]]s states that a convex polytope is uniquely determined by the geometry of its faces and combinatorial adjacency rules.
#[[Alexandrov's uniqueness theorem]] states that a convex polyhedron in three dimensions is uniquely determined by the [[metric space]] of [[geodesic]]s on its surface.

'''''SciGirls''''' is an American children's television series that premiered on February 11, 2010 on [[PBS Kids Go!]]. It has a mix of live-action and animated segments. It is produced by [[Twin Cities Public Television|Twin Cities PBS]].

It is an educational outreach program for elementary and middle-school children based on proven best practices for science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) education for girls. It was launched in February 2010 and produced by Twin Cities Public Television, the episodes are broadcast on most PBS stations, and the project's website is at http://pbskids.org/scigirls. ''SciGirls'' is designed to encourage girls to pursue STEM careers, in response to the low numbers of women in many scientific careers.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pbs.org/parents/scigirls/abouttheprogram/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tpt.org/uploads/pdfs/2484-5_SciGirls_press_release_Emmy_w_Izzie.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The show was awarded a [[Daytime Emmy Award]] in 2011 for Outstanding New Approaches in a Children's TV Show and Best Emmy for Summer 2011 and Metal Trophy for Winter 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/about/news/archive/2011/pbs-daytime-emmys/ PBS Daytime Emmys]&lt;/ref&gt; ''SciGirls'' developed from the award-winning PBS children's television series [[DragonflyTV]].

==Characters==
* '''Izzie''' (voiced by [[Lara Jill Miller]]) is a 12-year-old girl with a constantly expanding assortment of interests.  She also acts as the webmaster for the ''SciGirls'' website, which hosts a database of science videos following real-life SciGirls.  This resource often comes in handy, because whenever Izzie encounters a tricky situation and she is able to zap herself into her computer and follow along with the girls' investigations.  Afterward, she is easily able to design a solution to her own dilemma.
* '''Jake''' (voiced by [[Greg Cipes]]) has known Izzie since they were in preschool and has remained her closest friend.  He usually meets up with Izzie at school, online, or around the town.  More often than not, Jake finds himself drawn into Izzie's scientific situations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/teachers/scigirls/characters/ ''SciGirls'' characters]&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside Izzie and Jake, episodes feature several different groups of real SciGirls.

===Cameo characters===
*The Boy with Green Shirt (Flower Power)
*Mary with Orange Shirt (Flower Power)
*Julia with White Shirt (Flower Power)
*The Girl with Black Curly Hair (Flower Power)
*Jane (Mom) (Dolphin Dive)
*Grandpa Lou (Dolphin Dive)

==Episodes==
{{Main|List of SciGirls episodes}}

Season 2 launched in October 2012, Season 3 launched in April 2015, Season 4 launched in February 2018.

Each ''SciGirls'' half-hour episode depicts the STEM-themed activities of a group of middle-school girls including engineering a mini-wind farm, creating a turtle habitat, designing an electronic dress, and more.  Additionally, women scientists and engineers mentor the girls, demonstrating that interest in STEM subjects can lead to a rewarding lifelong pursuit.  The series is unified by two animated characters, Izzie and Jake, who emphasize how science and technology can help solve problems in everyday life.  These characters also appear on the series website, which is integrated into the TV episodes.

==Project approach==
The entire approach of ''SciGirls'' is based on published research into best practices for engaging girls in STEM. A quarter of a century of studies have converged on a set of common strategies which are built into the project's educational framework, and called the SciGirls Seven:{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

# Girls benefit from collaboration, especially when they can participate and communicate fairly (Fancsali, 2002; Parker &amp; Rennie, 2002). Girls are energized by the social part of science&amp;nbsp;– working and learning together. When discussions remain respectful and inclusive, every girl feels their contribution is valued. 
# Girls are motivated by projects they find personally relevant and meaningful (Eisenhart &amp; Finkel, 1998; Liston, Peterson, &amp; Ragan, 2008; Thompson &amp; Windschitl, 2005). Girls become engaged when they feel their project or task is important and can make a difference in their community. If they see how STEM is relevant to their own lives and interests, their attitude toward these subjects improves.
# Girls enjoy hands-on, open-ended projects and investigations (Burkam, Lee, &amp; Smerdon, 1997; Chatman, Nielsen, Strauss, &amp; Tanner, 2008; Fancsali, 2002). ''SciGirls'' promotes exploration, imagination, and invention&amp;nbsp;– encouraging girls to ask questions and explore all of the possibilities science and engineering have to offer.
# Girls are motivated when they can approach projects in their own way, applying their creativity, unique talents, and preferred learning styles (Calabrese Barton, Tan, &amp; Rivet, 2008; Eisenhart &amp; Finkel, 1998). ''SciGirls'' encourages girls to develop their own ways of exploring and sharing knowledge, and to come up with creative, exciting and surprising approaches to designing investigations, collecting data, and sharing their results.
# Girls' confidence and performance improves in response to specific, positive feedback on things they can control&amp;nbsp;– such as effort, strategies, and behaviors (Blackwell, Trzesniewski, &amp; Sorich Dweck, 2007; Halpern et al., 2007; Mueller &amp; Dweck, 1998; Zeldin &amp; Pajares, 2000). Self-confidence can make or break a girls' interest in STEM. SciGirls stresses that confronting problems and having experiments fail is a normal part of the scientific process.! 
# Girls gain confidence and trust in their own reasoning when encouraged to think critically (Chatman et al., 2008; Eisenhart &amp; Finkel, 1998). In ''SciGirls'' programming, asking questions and creative thinking are a must, even when these questions might challenge accepted ideas. When girls are free to voice their opinions and re-examine ideas from different perspectives, they become more engaged in STEM.
# Girls benefit from relationships with role models and mentors (Evans, Whigham, &amp; Wang, 1995; Liston et al., 2008). Seeing women who have succeeded in STEM helps inspire and motivate girls, especially when they can relate to these role models as people with lives outside of the lab. Role models and mentors not only broaden girls' views of who does science, but expand girls' vision of what's possible in their own lives.

In [[information theory]], '''specific-information''' is the [[Placeholder name|generic name]] given to the family of state-dependent measures that in expectation converge to the [[mutual information]]. There are currently three known varieties of specific information usually denoted &lt;math&gt;I_V&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;I_S&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;I_{ssi}&lt;/math&gt;.
The specific-information between a [[random variable]] &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and a state &lt;math&gt;Y=y&lt;/math&gt; is written as :&lt;math&gt;I( X ; Y = y)&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Team FREDNET''' is an international Open Source and Open Participation competitor in the [[Google Lunar X PRIZE]] competition. Uniquely, the team also allows organizations and individuals to participate freely in its mission through the team's website. Their strategy is to utilize the same approach for developing open source software in order to build a lunar lander and a lunar rovers capable of winning the Google Lunar X Prize.&lt;ref name=register&gt;{{cite web | title = The Register - Google encourages 10 teams to rocket to the moon. | url = https://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/02/22/google_xprize_lunar_teams/page2.html | date =  2008-02-22 | accessdate = September 12, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Team FREDNET plans to establish an Open Space Foundation that provides incentives, education, and funding to future individuals and organizations seeking to develop their own space projects. In addition, they hope to foster greater public interest and education in Space Exploration and Research.&lt;ref name=glxp&gt;{{cite web | title = FREDNET - X Prize Foundation

==Organization Overview==

=== Key People ===

Team FREDNET is led by Fred J. Bourgeois, III.&lt;ref name=glxp /&gt;  Dr. Sean Casey of the [[Universities Space Research Association]]&lt;ref name=spaceshow&gt;{{cite web | title = Space Show episode 1193 | url = http://www.thespaceshow.com/detail.asp?q=1193 | date = 2009-07-20 | accessdate = September 12, 2009 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100118224252/http://thespaceshow.com/detail.asp?q=1193 | archivedate = January 18, 2010 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; manages business development for Team FREDNET.  Mike Barrucco is the principal guidance, navigation, and control engineer for the team.&lt;ref name=spaceshow /&gt;  Richard Core is Team FREDNET's project manager.&lt;ref name=spaceshow /&gt;

===Key Affiliations===
Team FREDNET has affiliations with a number of clubs, schools, and businesses.

===Open Source Development Team===

The team's charter is "Make Cool Stuff".  This objective applies towards "stuff" that can be used in Space and towards building tools that will make it easier to build design the space "stuff".  Essentially, the goal is to build a catalog of Space Components in order to make Space Commercialization more open, cost-effective, productive, and accessible.&lt;ref name=threeteamsoneobjective&gt;
{{cite web | title = Three Teams, Many Goals, One Primary Mission | url = http://www.frednet.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=52:tfx-structure&amp;catid=40:org-faq-articles | accessdate = 2009-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Open Source Development Team====
Organizing this far-flung group posed perhaps the biggest and earliest challenge. Open source software teams can normally download a program and add their own contributions, but Team FREDNET had to translate its many individual ideas into rocket engines and rover gears.&lt;ref name=spaceglxparticle&gt;
{{cite web | title = Online Community Project Aims for the Moon | url = http://www.space.com/businesstechnology/090520-tw-glxp-frednet.html | accessdate = 2009-09-20 | date = 2009-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To address this challenge, Team FREDNET took major steps in August and September 2009 to make it easier for globally distributed collaboration to occur by providing guidelines for people who wanted to make contributions.&lt;ref name=newmembers&gt;
{{cite web | title = Guidelines for New Members | url = http://wiki.xprize.frednet.org/index.php/Guidelines_for_new_members | accessdate = 2009-09-20 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090821154525/http://wiki.xprize.frednet.org/index.php/Guidelines_for_new_members | archivedate = 2009-08-21 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Open Source Development Software Tools====
Team FREDNET relies heavily on Open Source Software Tools to accomplish their mission.

* The team uses [[MediaWiki]] software from the [[Wikimedia Foundation]] for organizing its development efforts.&lt;ref name=wikimedia&gt;{{cite web | title = Sites using MediaWiki/en | url = http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Sites_using_MediaWiki/en#T | accessdate = 2009-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Launchpad (website)|Launchpad]] is used for certain bug tracking and configuration management utilities.&lt;ref name=launchpad&gt;{{cite web | title = Team FREDNET in Launchpad | url = https://launchpad.net/~team-frednet | accessdate = 2009-10-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Blender (software)|Blender]] is the animation software the team uses for showing a simulation of the mission.&lt;ref name=blender&gt;{{cite web | url = http://wiki.teamfrednet.org/index.php/Talk:Animation_of_Lander_and_Rovers#Modeling_Software | title = Animation Talk Page | accessdate = 2009-10-25 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110728083052/http://wiki.teamfrednet.org/index.php/Talk:Animation_of_Lander_and_Rovers#Modeling_Software | archivedate = 2011-07-28 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Missions and Objectives==
[[Image:Frednet.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Team FREDNET tf(x) Lunar Rover Rendering|Team FREDNET tf(x) Rendering.|Team FREDNET tf(x) Lunar Rover Rendering.]]

===Mission Architecture===
Team FREDNET plans to use a simple architecture in their bid to win the Google Lunar X PRIZE, consisting of a small lander that will deploy a small lunar rover which in turn will use the lander as a communication relay back to Earth.&lt;ref name=MainMissionStatus&gt;{{cite web | url = http://wiki.teamfrednet.org/index.php/System_Overview#Main_mission_status | title = System Overview | accessdate = 2010-06-15 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100707224341/http://wiki.teamfrednet.org/index.php/System_Overview#Main_mission_status | archivedate = 2010-07-07 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three main components to the Team FREDNET mission which include (a) the transfer mission (i.e. getting the rover from the Earth to the Moon), (b) the Moon mission (i.e. directing the rover to accomplish the tasks needed to win the Google Lunar X-Prize), and (c) the Earth mission (i.e. receiving the data that the rover must transmit to Earth to win the Google Lunar X PRIZE).&lt;ref name=architecture&gt;{{cite web | title = System Overview / Mission Architecture | url = http://wiki.xprize.frednet.org/index.php/System_Overview#Mission_Architecture | accessdate = 2009-09-20 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090916024825/http://wiki.xprize.frednet.org/index.php/System_Overview#Mission_Architecture | archivedate = 2009-09-16 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Transfer Mission====
* The Launcher cost is proportional to mass. An applicable approximation is 31,000 $/kg. The launcher will put this mass to LEO orbit (8600&amp;nbsp;m/s of Delta_V for about 200&amp;nbsp;km LEO) with a solid propellant stage having a 260-second specific impulse.&lt;ref name=architecture /&gt;
* The Lunar Bus will do a number of maneuvers (elliptic transfer orbits) in order to gain 4400&amp;nbsp;m/s of Delta_V for the transfer orbit to the Moon. The Lunar Bus will use bi-propellant with a specific impulse of 320 s. Note that in some contexts we regard the Launcher and Bus as one component, the vehicle system transporting the Lander and Rover.&lt;ref name=architecture /&gt;

====The Moon Mission====
* The Lunar Lander is being designed to do a descent maneuver in order to gain 2200&amp;nbsp;m/s of Delta_V to transfer orbit to the Moon. The Lunar Bus will use a bi-propellant with a specific impulse of 320 s.&lt;ref name=architecture /&gt;
* The Lunar Rover plan is to travel 500 meters from the Lunar Lander then send prize-specified Mooncast, videos, pictures, emails, etc.&lt;ref name=architecture /&gt;

====The Earth Mission====
* A Ground Support System is planned to be able to receive the weak signal from the Moon in order to receive the rover Mooncast.&lt;ref name=architecture /&gt;

===Education Programs===
The team wants to offer educational institutions an opportunity to add science projects fitting inside the parameters of the mission to promote awareness of commercial space travel and space exploration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = About TEAM Frednet on the GLXP | url = http://www.googlelunarxprize.org/lunar/teams/frednet/about | accessdate = September 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of this education effort, the team has contributed towards a team that created a [[LEGO]] [[Lego Mindstorms|Mindstorms]] based rover that is controlled by [[Bluetooth]] technology.&lt;ref name=lego&gt;{{cite web | title = LEGO Mindstorms on Team FREDNET from the GLXP | url = http://www.googlelunarxprize.org/lunar/teams/frednet/blog/lego-picorover-mockup | accessdate = September 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A future elementary school level competition will be used to name the Rover that the team will eventually send to the moon.&lt;ref name=register /&gt;
