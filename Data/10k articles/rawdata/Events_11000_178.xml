==Overview==

The Aditya-L1 mission will be inserted in a halo orbit around the L1, which is about 1.5 million km from the Earth.  The 1,500 kg class satellite carries a total of seven payloads with diverse objectives, including but not limited to, the coronal heating problem, solar wind acceleration, coronal magnetometry, origin and monitoring of near-UV solar radiation (which drives Earth's upper atmospheric dynamics and global climate), coupling of the solar photosphere to chromosphere and corona, in-situ characterizations of the space environment around Earth by measuring energetic particle fluxes and magnetic fields of the solar wind and solar magnetic storms that have adverse effects on space and ground-based technologies.&lt;ref name="CurrSci_113_04"/&gt;

Aditya-L1 will be able to provide observations of Sun's photosphere, chromosphere and corona.  In addition, particle payloads will study the particle flux emanating from the Sun and reaching the L1 orbit, and the magnetometer payload will measure the variation in magnetic field strength at the halo orbit around L1.

==Payloads==
* '''Visible Emission Line Coronagraph (VELC):'''  Coronagraph creates an artificial total solar eclipse in space by blocking the sunlight by an occultor. This telescope will have capabilities of spectral imaging of the corona in visible and Infra-red. The objectives are to study the diagnostic parameters of solar corona and dynamics and origin of Coronal Mass Ejections (using 3 visible and 1 Infra-Red channels); magnetic field measurement of solar corona down to tens of Gauss. One wants to study the dynamical changes in the sun, why the solar atmosphere is so hot and how the changes in the sun can affect the interplanetary space and earth’s climate? The ejecta and the particles coming from the sun can affect the earth’s environment, called space weather; one need to predict that while studying the variability in the sun.  VELC payload weighs nearly 170 kg.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/here-comes-the-sun-watcher-indias-aditya-l1/article20942099.ece|title=Here comes the sun watcher, India’s Aditya-L1|last=Desikan|first=Shubashree|date=26 November 2017|work=TheHindu|access-date=26 November 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Solar Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope''' ('''SUIT'''): SUIT will observe the Sun between 200-400 nm wavelength range and it will provide full disk images of different layers of the solar atmosphere by making use of 11 filters. The Sun has never been observed from space in this wavelength range. The spacecraft being at the first Lagrangian point, SUIT shall be observing the Sun 24x7, without any interruption. The payload is being developed under the leadership of Prof. A. N. Ramaprakash and Prof. Durgesh Tripathi at the Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA), Pune in collaboration with ISRO and other institutes. SUIT payload weighs nearly 35 kg.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the major unsolved issues in the field of astrophysics is that the upper atmosphere of the Sun is a million degrees hot whereas the lower atmosphere is just 6000 degrees. In addition, we have not comprehended that how exactly the Sun’s radiation effects the dynamics of the Earth’s atmosphere on shorter as well as on longer time scale.  There are multi-fold advantages of observing the Sun in this wavelength range. On one hand, we shall obtain near simultaneous images of the different layers of the  Sun’s atmosphere, which shall let us study the ways in which the energy may be channeled and transferred from one layer to other. Using SUIT observations, we shall also be able to shed lights on the origin of energetic events occurring on the Sun’s surface such as flares and coronal mass ejections. On the other hand, the radiation from the Sun in this wavelength range governs the dynamics of the Earth’s atmosphere, for example, formation and dissociation of ozone layers. The ozone layer is of particular important as it blocks the UV radiation coming to the Earth and saving us from having skin cancer. Although solar radiation in this range is a very small fraction (~8%) of the total solar radiation, it varies by about 60% over a solar cycle. The SUIT observations will help us unravel the mystery of the cause of these variations.&lt;/p&gt;

The '''Age of the Sturlungs''' or the '''Sturlung Era''' ({{lang-is|Sturlungaöld}})  was a 42–44 year period of internal strife in mid-13th century [[Iceland]].  It may have been the bloodiest and most violent period in Icelandic history.  It is documented in the [[Sturlunga saga]].

[[Image:VassalToTheKing-Skardsbok.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A man swears vassalage to the King of Norway.  From the [[Skarðsbók]] manuscript]]

This period is marked by the conflicts of powerful chieftains, ''[[goði|goðar]]'', who amassed followers and fought wars, and is named for the [[Sturlungs]], the most powerful family clan in Iceland at the time.  At the end of the era, the [[Icelandic Commonwealth]] ceased to exist and Iceland became a part of [[Norway]].

Historians generally regard the year 1220 as the first year of the Age of the Sturlungs, although some wish to place its beginning at an earlier date because of the [[Battle of Víðines]].  Power in the country had consolidated within the grasp of a few family clans.  They were:

* The [[Haukdælir]], of Árnesþing
* The [[Oddaverjar]], of Rangárþing
* The [[Ásbirnings|Ásbirningar]], of [[Skagafjörður]]
* The [[Vatnsfirðings|Vatnsfirðingar]] of [[Ísafjörður]]
* The [[Svínfellings|Svínfellingar]] of the [[Eastern Region (Iceland)|Eastern Region]]
* The [[Sturlungs|Sturlungar]], of [[Hvammur]] in Dalir

At this time, [[Haakon IV of Norway|Hákon the Old]], King of Norway, was trying to extend his influence in Iceland.  Many Icelandic chieftains became his [[vassal]]s and were obliged to do his bidding—in exchange they received gifts, followers and a status of respect.  Consequently, the greatest Icelandic chieftains were soon affiliated with the King of Norway in one way or the other.

==''Goðar''==

In the [[Icelandic Commonwealth]], power was mostly in the hands of the [[Goði|''goðar'']] (local chieftains).  Iceland was effectively divided into [[Farthings of Iceland|farthing]]s (quarters).  Within each farthing were nine ''Goði''-dominions (''"Goðorð"'').  The North farthing had an additional three dominions due to its size.  All in all they were 39.

The ''Goði''-chieftains protected the farmers in their territory, and exacted compensation or vengeance if their followers' rights were violated.  In exchange, the farmers pledged their support to the ''Goði'', both by voting in his favor in the ''[[Althing|Alþingi]]'' parliament and (if needed) by taking up arms against his enemies.

The powers of the ''Goði''-chieftains, however, were neither permanent nor inherited.  This status came about by a combination of respect, honour, influence and wealth.  The chieftains constantly had to demonstrate their qualities as leaders, either by giving gifts to their followers or by holding great feasts.  If the chieftain was seen as failing in any respect, his followers could simply choose another, more qualified ''Goði'' to support.

The greatest chieftains of the 12th and 13th century started amassing great wealth, and subsuming lesser dominions.  This may be one of the causes of the civil war.

==Course of events==

===Beginning===

&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Snorri sturluson 230903.jpg|thumb|right|180px|An early 20th century painting of Snorri]] --&gt;
The Age of Sturlungs began in 1220, when [[Snorri Sturluson]], chieftain of the Sturlung clan and one of the great [[Icelandic saga]] writers, became a vassal of [[Haakon IV of Norway|King Hákon of Norway]].  The king insisted that Snorri help him bring Iceland under the sovereignty of Norway. Snorri returned home, and although he soon became the country's most powerful chieftain, he did little to enforce the king's will. According to one historian, "we do not know whether [Snorri's] inactivity was due to lack of will or his conviction that the case was hopeless".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title = The History of Iceland |last = Karlsson |first = Gunnar |year = 2000 | page = 80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1235, Snorri's nephew [[Sturla Sighvatsson]] also accepted vassalage under the king.  Sturla was more aggressive: he sent his uncle back to Norway, and started warring on the chieftains who refused to accept the king's demands.  However, Sturla and his father Sighvatur were soundly defeated by [[Gissur Þorvaldsson]], the chief of the [[Haukdælir]], and [[Kolbeinn the young]], chief of the [[Ásbirnings]], in [[Örlygsstaðir]] in [[Skagafjörður]].  The [[Battle of Örlygsstaðir]] was the largest armed conflict in the history of Iceland—the Sturlungs (Sturla Sighvatsson) had 1000 armed men and the [[Ásbirnings |Ásbirningar]] (Kolbeinn the young) had 1200 armed men. More than 50 people were killed.  After this crushing defeat, Gissur and Kolbeinn became the most powerful chieftains in the country.

Snorri Sturluson returned home to Iceland, having fallen out of favor with the king due to his support for Earl Skúli in an attempted coup.  Gissur Þorvaldsson, also a vassal of the Norwegian king, received instructions that Snorri be killed.  In 1241, Gissur went with many men to Snorri's home and murdered him.  Snorri's last words are said to have been "''Eigi skal höggva!''" ({{lang-en|"Do not strike!"}}).

===Þórður kakali stirs up trouble===

[[Image:HakonTheOldAndSkule-Flateyjarbok.jpg|thumb|left|220px|An illustration of Hákon, King of Norway, and [[Skule Bårdsson]], from [[Flateyjarbók]]]]

A year later, [[Þórður Sighvatsson|Þórður kakali Sighvatsson]] (the nickname ''kakali'' probably means "The Stutterer"), son of Sighvatur, Snorri's brother, returned home to Iceland from abroad.  He had cause for vengeance, for his brothers and father had fallen in the [[Battle of Örlygsstaðir]].  He soon showed himself to be a formidable tactician and leader.  Four years later, the rule of the [[Ásbirnings]] was effectively over, after fierce battles with Þórður.  The battles [[Flóabardagi]] (1244 – the only naval battle in Icelandic history with Icelanders on both sides) and the [[Battle of Haugsnes]] (1246 – the bloodiest battle in Icelandic history with about 110 fatalities) both take place during this period.

Þórður kakali and Gissur Þorvaldsson, however, did not fight each other.  Both were vassals of the king of Norway, and they appealed to him as dispute mediator.  The king decided in favor of Þórður and from 1247–1250 Þórður ruled Iceland almost alone.  He died in Norway, six years later.

===Gissur returns and the Commonwealth ends===

In 1252 the king sent Gissur to Iceland.  The followers of Þórður kakali were displeased and tried to kill him by putting his residence in [[Flugumýri]] in [[Skagafjörður]] to the torch—this incident is known as ''[[Flugumýrarbrenna]]'' ("The burning of Flugumýri").  Despite his influence and power, Gissur was unable to find the leader of the arsonists, and was forced to return to Norway in 1254 to bear the censure of the king, who was displeased with his failure in bringing Iceland under the Norwegian throne.

Minor conflicts continued throughout Iceland.  Meanwhile, Gissur was given the title of [[Jarl (title)|Jarl]] and sent home to negotiate.  Only when the king had sent his special emissary, Hallvarður gullskór ("Goldenshoes"), did the Icelanders agree on Norwegian kingship.  The Commonwealth came to an end with the signing of the ''[[Old Covenant (Iceland)|Gamli sáttmáli]]'' ("Old Covenant") agreement in 1264.

'''Aleksandr Fyodorovich Akimov''' ({{lang-ru|Александр Фёдорович Акимов}}; 6 May 1953 – 11 May 1986) was the shift supervisor of the night crew that worked at the [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant]] Unit #4 on the night of the [[Chernobyl disaster]], April 26, 1986.

==Chernobyl disaster==
The turbine was shut down as planned, and the power surged. Akimov pressed the AZ-5 (Class Five Emergency) to shut down the poisoned reactor. The control rods seized around 2-2.5 meters into the reactor (the reactor goes down to a depth of seven meters), but the boron bars had a graphite cover that caused an increase in power. The reactor then exploded, and the communications networks were suddenly flooded with calls and information - Akimov heard reports of massive reactor damage, but would not believe it and therefore relayed false information about the state of the reactor for a few hours.&lt;ref&gt;Felicity Barringer: Life After Death. The New York Times, April 22, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Once he knew the full extent of the accident, he worked with his crew in the reactor building until early morning, trying to pump water into the exposed [[Nuclear reactor technology|reactor]]. None of the men who stayed behind to save the reactor wore any protective gear.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Akimov died two weeks after the accident due to [[acute radiation syndrome]], also known as radiation poisoning, at the age of 33. In the inquiry, he and his co-workers were blamed. Later the blame was put on the plant's director and manager. The crew and directors did not adhere to the plant's safety guidelines and ignored repeated warnings of the control system.&lt;ref name="TheNTelegraph1"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=fZ8rAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=RvwFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6335,4713567&amp;dq=alexander+akimov&amp;hl=en | title= U.S. doctor indicates Chernobyl toll now at 13 | date=1986-05-16 | publisher= The Telegraph, Nashua }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Medvedev G.

'''Elections to the Algerian Assembly''' were held in Algeria in February 1951.&lt;ref name=DS&gt;[[Dolf Sternberger]], [[Bernhard Vogel (politician)|Bernhard Vogel]], [[Dieter Nohlen]] &amp; Klaus Landfried (1978) ''Die Wahl der Parlamente: Band II: Afrika, Erster Halbband'', p432 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like other post-1948 elections in French Algeria, it was rigged by the authorities to ensure the defeat of Algerian nationalists.&lt;ref name=FT&gt;Frank Tachau (1994) ''Political parties of the Middle East and North Africa'', Greenwood Press, p10&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electoral system==
The Assembly was elected by two colleges, each of which elected 60 seats; the First College consisted of Europeans and [[évolué]]s, whilst the Second College was composed of the remainder of the Algerian population.

The '''Anne Frank tree''' ({{lang-nl|Anne Frankboom}}&lt;ref name="NU19" /&gt; or, incorrectly, ''Anne Frank boom''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.annefranktree.nl/index.aspx?lang=nl|title=Anne Frank Boom|publisher=[[Anne Frank House]]|accessdate=19 November 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071116150749/http://www.annefranktree.nl/index.aspx?lang=nl| archivedate= 16 November 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[Aesculus hippocastanum|horse-chestnut tree]] (''Aesculus hippocastanum'') in the city center of [[Amsterdam]] that was featured in [[Anne Frank]]'s ''[[The Diary of a Young Girl]]''. Anne Frank described the tree from [[Anne Frank House|The Annexe]], the building where she and her family were hiding from the [[Nazism|Nazis]] during [[World War II]].

Over the years, the tree deteriorated significantly due to both a fungus and a [[moth]] infestation. The [[Amsterdam (municipality)#Boroughs|Borough]] Amsterdam Centrum declared that the tree had to be cut down on 20 November 2007 due to the risk that it could otherwise fall down. However, on 21 November 2007, a judge issued a temporary injunction stopping the removal. The Foundation and the neighbours developed an alternative plan to save the tree. The neighbours and supporters formed the Foundation Support Anne Frank Tree which carried out the suggested supporting construction and took over the maintenance of the tree.

On 23 August 2010, the tree was [[windthrow|blown down]] by high winds during a storm, breaking off approximately {{convert|1|m|ft}} above ground.&lt;ref name="Gray-Block"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gray-Block|first=Aaron|title=Anne Frank tree falls over in heavy wind, rain|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKTRE67M28P20100823|accessdate=23 August 2010|newspaper=Reuters UK Edition|date=23 August 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100830011837/http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKTRE67M28P20100823| archivedate= 30 August 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSLDE67M1DH Anne Frank tree falls over in heavy wind] Reuters.

The tree was estimated to be between 150 and 170 years old.

==Anne Frank==
The tree is mentioned three times&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=CNN|date=30 April 2010|title=Anne Frank's tree, now dying, still inspires hope and new life|author=Jessica Ravitz|url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/US/04/30/anne.frank.tree/index.html?hpt=C1}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Anne Frank]]'s diary ''[[The Diary of a Young Girl]]''. On 23 February 1944, she writes about the tree: {{quote|''Ik ga haast elke ochtend naar de zolder waar Peter werkt om de bedompte kamerlucht uit mijn longen te laten waaien. Vanuit mijn lievelingsplekje op de grond kijk ik naar de blauwe hemel, naar de kale kastanjeboom aan wiens takken kleine druppeltjes schitteren, naar de meeuwen en de andere vogels, die in hun scheervlucht wel van zilver lijken. [...] 'Zolang dit nog bestaat', dacht ik 'en ik het mag beleven, deze zonneschijn, die hemel waaraan geen wolk is, zolang kan ik niet treurig zijn'.''&lt;br/&gt;Nearly every morning I go to the attic to blow the stuffy air out of my lungs, from my favorite spot on the floor I look up at the blue sky and the bare chestnut tree, on whose branches little raindrops shine, appearing like silver, and at the [[seagull]]s and other birds as they glide on the wind. [...] As long as this exists, I thought, and I may live to see it, this sunshine, the cloudless skies, while this lasts I cannot be unhappy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = The Netherlands: Anne Frank’s Chestnut Tree to Be Cut Down|publisher = The Associated Press|format = reprint|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/15/world/europe/15briefs-amsterdamtree.html?_r=1&amp;n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fPeople%2fF%2fFrank%2c%20Anne&amp;oref=slogin|date = 2006-11-15|accessdate = 2006-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Otto Frank]], Anne's father, described his thoughts upon reading the diary for the first time in a 1968 speech. He described his surprise at learning of the tree's importance to Anne as follows: {{quote|How could I have suspected that it meant so much to Anne to see a patch of blue sky, to observe the gulls during their flight and how important the chestnut tree was to her, as I recall that she never took an interest in nature. But she longed for it during that time when she felt like a caged bird. She only found consolation in thinking about nature. But she had kept such feelings completely to herself.&lt;ref name = pressrelease&gt;{{cite press release|title = Horse chestnut tree diseased |publisher = The Anne Frank House|accessdate = 2006-11-17|url = http://www.annefrank.org/content.asp?pid=445&amp;lid=2| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061003170532/http://www.annefrank.org/content.asp?PID=445&amp;LID=2| archivedate= 3 October 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Interactive project==
The ''Anne Frank Tree'' is also the name of an interactive project started by the [[Anne Frank House]] in 2006, when it was opened by [[Emma Thompson]].&lt;ref name="PressreleaseDigitalTree"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.annefrank.org/content.asp?PID=721&amp;LID=2|publisher=annefrank.org|date=1 February 2006|title=Launch ‘Anne Frank Tree’ and ‘Anne Frank Guide’|author=[[Anne Frank Foundation]]|accessdate=19 November 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071107053554/http://www.annefrank.org/content.asp?PID=721&amp;LID=2| archivedate= 7 November 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Visitors to the museum are able to leave their name and location on a "leaf" of the tree, showing their affinity with Anne Frank.&lt;ref name="IHT0210"/&gt; Part of the intended audience of the on-line project are students of the more than 200 schools in the world named after Anne Frank.&lt;ref name="PressreleaseDigitalTree"/&gt;

==Recent events==
[[Image:Anne Frank Tree.jpg|frame|The tree in 2003]]
Concerns about the tree's health date back to at least 1993, when a soil analysis revealed that leakage from a nearby underground domestic fuel tank was endangering the tree's root system. The city of Amsterdam spent €160,000 on a soil sanitation program to save the tree.&lt;ref name = pressrelease/&gt; For the last several years, the tree was attacked by a particularly aggressive fungus (''[[Ganoderma applanatum]]'', also called "Artist's Conch" or "Artist's Bracket") which rotted the wood and undermined the tree's stability. Additionally, [[horse-chestnut leaf miner]] moth [[caterpillar]]s (''Cameraria ohridella'') ate the tree's leaves, causing them to  turn brown prematurely and fall off.&lt;ref name = pressrelease/&gt;

On 26 May 2005, the tree's [[crown (botany)|crown]] was drastically trimmed after a six-month study by [[botanist]]s concluded that this was the best way to ensure the tree's stability. However, the disease continued to thrive and a 2006 study estimated that 42% of the wood was rotten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Felling request for the Anne Frank tree |publisher=The Anne Frank House |accessdate=18 November 2006 |url=http://www.annefrank.org/content.asp?PID=33&amp;LID=2 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061003154648/http://www.annefrank.org/content.asp?PID=33&amp;LID=2 |archivedate=3 October 2006  |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some botanists concluded that the tree's death was unavoidable and the owner of the property decided to ask for a permit to cut the tree down in order to eliminate the risk of the huge tree collapsing.

In September 2007, an appeals panel made two decisions: one upholding the right of the tree's owner to have it cut down any time in the next two years, and one granting a request by the country's Trees Institute to investigate the possibility of saving it.  Property owner Henric Pomes of Keizersgracht 188, adjacent to the building that is now the [[Anne Frank Museum]], agreed to wait for the institute's proposal, due before 1 January 2008.

On 2 October 2007, and later the Dutch Tree Foundation ({{lang-nl|Bomenstichting}}), was involved in the discussions.&lt;ref name="IHT0210"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/10/02/news/letter.php |work=International Herald Tribune |date=2 October 2007 |accessdate=19 November 2007 |title=Letter from Amsterdam: Is Anne Frank's tree in Amsterdam doomed to disappear? |author=Tagliabue, John |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014013238/http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/10/02/news/letter.php |archivedate=14 October 2007  |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 November 2007, it claimed the tree was healthy enough to cause no danger,&lt;ref name="NU15"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nu.nl/news/1316439/10/'Anne_Frankboom_kan_blijven_staan'.html |date=15 November 2007 |title=Anne Frankboom kan blijven staan |accessdate=19 November 2007 |publisher=[[nu.nl]] |author=[[Algemeen Nederlands Persbureau]] |language=Dutch |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AUc6lYPp?url=http://www.nu.nl/algemeen/1316439/anne-frankboom-kan-blijven-staan.html |archivedate=7 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; based upon second opinion analysis by Neville Fay (a famous English expert of ancient trees) and by Frits Gielissen (a Dutch expert from O.B.T.A. De Linde).

On 13 November 2007, the Borough Amsterdam-Centrum declared  that it would cut down the tree on 21 November 2007.&lt;ref name=AP20071113&gt;{{citation |title=Anne Frank tree to be cut down Nov. 21 |publisher=Fort Wayne Journal Gazette |url=http://www.jg.net/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071113/NEWS04/71113016&amp;template=printart |author=Associated Press |date=13 November 2007 |accessdate=13 November 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716183610/http://www.jg.net/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20071113%2FNEWS04%2F71113016&amp;template=printart |archivedate=16 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, a pulling test was banned, but four days after that, this assessment of the strength of the tree was conducted. Boom-KCB, an engineering firm specialized in trees,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boom-kcb.nl/ Boom-kcb.nl] – official website of ''Boom-KCB''&lt;/ref&gt; determined that the tree was "storm-proof", and able to sustain itself, eliminating the need for outside interference as it did not pose a danger for the public.&lt;ref name="NU19"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nu.nl/news/1322126/10/rss/Bomenstichting_test_sterkte_'Anne_Frankboom'.html |date=19 November 2007 |title=Bomenstichting test sterkte 'Anne Frankboom' |accessdate=19 November 2007 |publisher=[[nu.nl]] |author=[[Algemeen Nederlands Persbureau]] |language=Dutch |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AUc4H3QR?url=http://www.nu.nl/algemeen/1322126/anne-frankboom-nog-sterk-genoeg.html |archivedate=7 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A court hearing involving the Tree Foundation was held the day before the scheduled removal.&lt;ref name=Reuters20071115&gt;{{cite news |last=Stevenson |first=Reed |title=Activists step in to stop felling of Anne Frank tree |newspaper=Washington Post |date=15 November 2007 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/15/AR2007111501440.html  | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20121104061946/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/15/AR2007111501440.html  | dead-url =yes  | archive-date =4 November 2012 |accessdate=16 November 2007}}

They urged the [[Mayor of Amsterdam]], Job Cohen, to proceed with emergency cutting.

[[File:AnneFrankHumanRightsMemorialSapling.jpg|thumb|upright|One of the eleven saplings in the U.S. is at the [[Anne Frank Human Rights Memorial]] in [[Boise, Idaho]]]]

On 17 December 2007, the working committee Support Anne Frank Tree presented its alternative plan to preserve the tree (the report has English abstracts &amp; conclusions) which included a construction to prevent the trunk from breaking down. Some weeks later, tree experts from both sides presented a joint evaluation of the tree. Their judgment was that the tree had a life expectancy of at least 5–15 years. To ensure safety, the supporting construction should be built.

The supporting structure, finished in May 2008, was designed to make it possible for the tree to survive at least five more years.&lt;ref&gt;De Volkskrant, 8 April 2008, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.support-annefranktree.nl/index_en.htm Support Anne Frank Tree.nl] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080119161102/http://www.support-annefranktree.nl/index_en.htm |date=19 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 August 2010, the tree was blown over in a rain-and-gale storm, breaking off about a meter above the ground.&lt;ref name="Gray-Block"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gray-Block |first=Aaron |title=Anne Frank tree falls over in heavy wind and rain |agency=Reuters |date=23 August 2010 |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2010/08/23/us-annefrank-tree-idUKTRE67M28P20100823 |accessdate=9 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It fell across a garden wall and damaged garden sheds but did not damage anything else. The next day, it was reported that a small side shoot was growing out of the stump below where it broke, and it is hoped that it will grow into a new tree. There are plans to keep large pieces of the fallen trunk and its large branches. The fallen tree is estimated to weigh about 27 [[metric ton]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/huff-wires/20100824/eu-netherlands-anne-frank-tree/ Small shoot to give Anne Frank tree new life] Huffington Post, 24 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the images in the Reuters report show, for most of the cross-section of the trunk, the characteristic fracture pattern of decayed wood across all the trunk cross-section except a thin rim of [[sapwood (wood)|sapwood]]. The fallen wood has now been removed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.annefrank.org/en/Worldwide/Anne-Frank-Boom/ image]&lt;/ref&gt;

Eleven [[sapling]]s from the tree have been distributed in the [[United States]] to museums, schools, parks and [[Holocaust]] remembrance centers through a project led by [http://annefrank.com The Anne Frank Center USA]. The first sapling was planted in April 2013 at [[The Children's Museum of Indianapolis]].

[[File:Heckrund4.JPG|thumb|[[Heck cattle]] have been bred to resemble the aurochs in the 1920s. Since they are regarded as not meeting the criteria for "new aurochs", recent efforts such as the [[TaurOs Project]] and [[Uruz Project]] attempt to get considerably closer to the wild aurochs.]]
[[File:Steppentarpan.jpg|thumb|[[Heck horse]] in [[Haselünne]], [[Germany]].]]

'''Breeding back''' is a form of [[artificial selection]] by the deliberate [[selective breeding]] of [[domestication|domestic]] animals, in an attempt to achieve an animal breed with a [[phenotype]] that resembles a [[wildtype]] ancestor, usually one that is [[extinction|extinct]] in its wild form. Breeding back is not to be confused with [[dedomestication]].

It must be kept in mind that a breeding-back breed may be very similar to the extinct wild type in phenotype, ecological niche, and to some extent genetics, but the initial [[gene pool]] of that wild type is lost forever with its [[extinction]]. It is not truly possible for a breeding back attempt to actually recreate an extinct wild type that is the breeding target, as an extinct wild type cannot be resurrected via selective breeding alone. Furthermore, even the outward authenticity of a bred-back type depends on the quality of the stock used as the foundation of the project. As a result, some breeds, like [[Heck cattle]], are at best a vague look-alike of the extinct wildtype [[aurochs]], according to the literature.&lt;ref name="vanVuure"&gt;Cis van Vuure: Retracing the Aurochs – History, Morphology and Ecology of an extinct wild Ox. 2005. {{ISBN|954-642-235-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
[[File:Rebuilding a Species.ogv|thumb|left|[[VOA]] report about the Quagga Project]]
It is the target of breeding back to restore the wild traits that may have been preserved in domestic animals within one breeding lineage. Commonly, not only the phenotype but also the ecological capacity are considered in breeding back projects, because hardy breeding back results are used in certain [[Conservation movement|conservation]] projects. In nature, usually only individuals suited to the natural circumstances can survive and reproduce, while humans select those with additional attractive, docile or productive characteristics. Therefore, selection criteria in nature versus those in domestic conditions are different and domesticated animals often differ significantly in [[phenotype]], behaviour and [[genetics]] from their wild forerunners. It is the target of breeding back to re-create the wild traits that may have been preserved in domestic animals within one breeding lineage.

In many cases, the extinct wild type ancestors of a given species are known only through skeletons and, in some cases, historical descriptions, so their phenotype is not directly accessible. Therefore, there is no certainty of success with a breeding back attempt and the results must be reviewed with caution. In order to test genetic closeness, both [[mitochondrial DNA]] and [[nuclear DNA]] have to be accessible. However, success is possible: humans selected only for superficial characters and as a rule did not change inner mechanisms such as digestion.&lt;ref name="vanVuure"/&gt;  Further, since many domestic animals show a behaviour that is derived from their wild ancestors (such as the herding instinct of [[cattle]] or the social instincts of [[dog]]s), and are fit to survive under natural circumstances, as evidenced by the many [[feral]] populations of many domestic animals, it can be presumed that back-bred animals will function like their wild ancestors.&lt;ref name="vanVuure"/&gt;  For example, food choice should be the same in domestic and wild types. [[Natural selection]] could serve as an additional tool in creating authentic robustness, behaviour and maybe also phenotype. For large herbivores, a sufficient predator population would also be necessary to support such a process, but this predator population is largely not present in today's [[Europe]], where many breeding back projects are conducted.

There is a difference between creating a look-alike breed from domestic animals and creating a look-alike via artificial selection of individuals of a different species or subspecies that may resemble the animal that is targeted. 

For example, the [[Quagga Project]] is trying to breed animals which strongly resemble the original [[Quagga]] of South Africa.  The quagga was a subspecies of the [[plains zebra]] and has no descendants.  Accordingly, the Project is limited to selecting for the physical appearance of the original, as illustrated by twenty three mounted specimens, contemporary paintings and written accounts.    

However, the two most noticeable characteristics of the quagga, fewer stripes and darker pelage, are frequently observed to varying degrees in wild plains zebra populations.  Animals with these characteristic are included in the Quagga Project breeding programme.  

After nearly thirty years of selective breeding, to concentrate these characteristics, recent foals show a marked resemblance to the original.

== Use ==

Bred-back breeds are interesting for [[conservation biology]] since they may fill an ecological gap that has been left due to the extinction of the wildtypes due to hunting by humans. As long as food choice, behaviour, robustness, defence against predators, hunting or foraging instincts and phenotype are the same as in the wild type, it will function like it in the wilderness. Releasing such animals into the wild would fill the previously empty niche and allows a natural dynamic between the species of the ecosystem to re-evolve. However, breeding-back attempts do not always result in an animal that is closer to the wild type than other domestic breeds. For example, Heck cattle bear less resemblance to the aurochs than many Iberian fighting cattle do.&lt;ref name="vanVuure"/&gt;

== Examples==

=== Aurochs ===
Ideas for creating an [[aurochs]]-like animal from domestic cattle have been around since 1835. In the 1920s, [[Heinz Heck|Heinz]] and [[Lutz Heck]] tried to breed a look-alike using central European dairy breeds and southern European cattle. The result, Heck cattle, are hardy, but differ from the aurochs in many respects, although a resemblance in colour and sometimes also horns has been achieved.&lt;ref name="vanVuure"/&gt; From 1996 onwards, Heck cattle have been crossed with primitive Iberian breeds like [[Sayaguesa Cattle]] and Fighting cattle, and the very large Italian breed [[Chianina]] in a number of German reserves in order to enhance the resemblance to the aurochs. The results are called [[Taurus cattle]], which are larger and more long-legged than Heck cattle and have a more aurochs-like horn shape. Another project to achieve a type of cattle that resembles the aurochs is [[TaurOs Project]], using primitive and hardy southern European breeds and also Scottish [[Highland cattle]]. These Tauros cattle are planned to be established in various European natural reserves.

=== European wild horse ===
The Polish [[Konik]] horse is often erroneously considered the result of a breeding-back experiment to "recreate" the [[phenotype]] of the [[Tarpan]], the European [[wild horse]]. The Konik is actually a hardy [[landrace]] breed originating in Poland which was called ''Panje horse'' before agriculturist [[Tadeusz Vetulani]] coined the name "Konik" in the 1920s. Vetulani did start an experiment trying to reconstruct the Tarpan using Koniks, but his stock only had a minor contribution to the modern Konik population.&lt;ref name="DPK"&gt;Tadeusz Jezierski, Zbigniew Jaworski: ''Das Polnische Konik. Die Neue Brehm-Bücherei Bd. 658'', Westarp Wissenschaften, Hohenwarsleben 2008, {{ISBN|3-89432-913-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, during World War II, the Heck brothers crossed Koniks with [[Przewalski's horse]]s and also other ponies like [[Icelandic horse]]s and [[Gotland pony|Gotland ponies]]; the result is now called the [[Heck Horse]]. During the last decades, Heck horses have continuously been crossed with Koniks, so that their phenotype now is nearly indistinguishable, except that the Heck horse has a slenderer build on average.&lt;ref name="Weiden"&gt;Bunzel-Drüke, Finck, Kämmer, Luick, Reisinger, Riecken, Riedl, Scharf &amp; Zimball: ''"Wilde Weiden: Praxisleitfaden für Ganzjahresbeweidung in Naturschutz und Landschaftsentwicklung''&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides the Konik-type horses, the [[Exmoor Pony]] that still lives in a [[semi-feral]] state in some parts of Southern England has also been claimed to be closer to the European wild horse as it carries [[pangare]] coloration and has a resemblance to the horses in [[Lascaux]] [[cave paintings]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurowildlife.org/news/wild-horses-for-europe–-which-breed-is-the-best/ ''European Wildlife'']&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wolf ===
[[File:Tamaskan.jpg|thumb|A [[Tamaskan Dog]], bred to visually resemble a wolf.]]
Although the [[wolf]], the wild ancestor of domestic dogs, is not extinct, its phenotype is the target of several developmental breeds including the [[Northern Inuit Dog]] and the [[Tamaskan Dog]]. They are all crossbreeds of [[German Shepherd]]s, [[Alaskan Malamutes]] and [[husky|huskies]], selected for phenotypic wolf characteristics. Therefore, these breeds are breeding-back attempts as well.&lt;ref&gt;C. Gamborg et al: ''[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/whp/ev/2010/00000019/00000001/art00005 De-Domestication: Ethics at the Intersection of Landscape Restoration and Animal Welfare] In: ''Environmental Values'' 2010, 19(1):57-78&lt;/ref&gt;

Although extinct, [[Japanese wolf]] DNA survives in the modern domestic [[Shikoku Inu]]. It is thought that crossing this breed with some subspecies of [[Asian Wolf]] would result in a authentic analogue to fill the ecological niche left by the absence of the apex predator.

The Dire Wolf Project, started in 1988, concerns the [[dire wolf]], an extinct prehistoric wolf, and aims to bring it back by breeding different dog breeds that resemble it.

The '''Changchun Film Festival''' (中国长春电影节) is a biennial international [[film festival]] held in the Chinese city of [[Changchun]]. Ostensibly international, its award for best film, the '''Golden Deer''' has nevertheless primarily been awarded to Chinese and other East Asia-region films. It was first held in 1992 and was founded in part by the Changchun Film Studio (now the [[Changchun Film Studio Group Corporation]]). 

The festival is funded in part by the Ministry of Radio, Cinema, and Television, the provincial government of [[Jilin]], and the Changchun municipal government.

'''Children in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict''' refers to the impact of the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]] on minors in [[Israel]] and the [[Palestinian territories]]. Laurel Holliday, in her 1999 book ''Children of Israel/Palestine'', writes that two "ethnically distinct peoples – both Palestinians and Israeli Jews – lay claim to the very same sand, stone, rivers, vegetation, seacoast, and mountains" and that the stories she presents show that "Israeli and Palestinian children grow up feeling that they are destined for conflict with their neighbors".&lt;ref&gt;Laurel Holliday, ''Children of Israel/Palestine'', Simon and Schuster, 1999, [https://books.google.com/books?id=mOSZr5sE7noC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=children+Israel+Palestine+conflict&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=uyfPUPaYCYfg0gGjzoHIDw&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=children%20Israel%20Palestine%20conflict&amp;f=false p. xv], {{ISBN|0-671-00804-8}}, 9780671008048.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the [[Israeli Defense Forces]] and militant Palestinian groups have been accused of violating the rights of children and causing injury and death. The media has been used manipulatively to create support for different sides. Children have been the victims of indoctrination, school closures, medical problems and post-traumatic stress as a result of the conflict. At the same time, various educational projects have been established to counter indoctrination and negative stereotypes. [[Joseph Massad]] has argued that the Western media are far more sensitive to the deaths of Jewish children than to child fatalities among Palestinians,&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Massad]], [http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2011/05/201152911579533291.html 'Are Palestinian children less worthy?,'] [[Al Jazeera]] May 30, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Sarah Honig]] argues the opposite position, that the international media tolerates murder of Jewish children and infants, particularly settler children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Another-Tack-Zissel-means-sweetie-380371 Another Tack: Zissel Means Sweetie], JPost, [[Sarah Honig]], 30 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In late April 2015 [[Human Rights Watch]] asked the UN to put both Israel and [[Hamas]] on its "List of Shame" regarding grave violations of children's rights in a conflict.&lt;ref name="HRW4615"&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/06/04/un-ensure-integrity-children-s-list-shame 'UN: Ensure Integrity of Children’s ‘List of Shame’,'] [[Human Rights Watch]] 4 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

A UN draft report on children in armed conflict, scheduled for publication in mid-June 2015, and prepared by [[Leila Zerrougui]] for the Secretary General of the United Nations reportedly recommended adding both Israel and Hamas to the "List of Shame", due to repeated violations of children's rights. Human Rights Watch wrote to Ban Ki-Moon on the 27 April requesting that the names of Israel and Hamas remain on the list, in the context of reports that Israel had been lobbying to have its name removed. Israel denies it has lobbied the UN over this. Inclusion in the list requires that a pattern of multiple instances of repeated abuses of children be evidenced. Human Rights Watch noted that in its 2014 report on events in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict over the preceding year, nearly 12 dozen Palestinian children were said to have been killed by Israel and over 1,200 Palestinian children had been injured. In addition 41 incidents in which school facilities were damaged, classes interrupted and students injured by IDF forces were registered. Palestinian armed groups, the reports also noted, had launched in the same period some 63 rockets into Israel from Gaza, resulting in disruptions to their schooling of over 12,000 Israeli children.&lt;ref name="HRW4615" /&gt;

==Terrorist attacks targeting children==
Though Israeli children were killed in the conflict during the decades prior, the first acts of Palestinian violence specifically targeting large numbers of Israeli children were committed in the 1970s.

The [[Avivim school bus massacre]] was a [[terrorist attack]] on an Israeli school bus on May 22, 1970 in which 12 Israeli civilians were killed, nine of them children, and 25 were wounded. The attack took place on the road to Moshav [[Avivim]], near Israel's border with [[Lebanon]]. Two [[bazooka]] shells were fired at the bus.&lt;ref name="jpost.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Home/Article.aspx?id=28775|title=Moshav Avivim still stands determined during tensions|work=The Jerusalem Post |accessdate=April 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attack was one of the first carried out by the [[PFLP-GC]].&lt;ref name=Yodfat&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qvoNAAAAQAAJ&amp;lpg=PA145&amp;dq=avivim%20pflp&amp;client=safari&amp;pg=PA145#v=onepage&amp;q=avivim%20pflp&amp;f=false ''PLO Strategy and Politics'' by Aryeh Y. Yodfat, Yuval Arnon-Ohanna]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ma'alot massacre]] in May 1974 involved a two-day hostage-taking of 115 people which ended in the deaths of over 25 hostages. It began when three armed members of the [[Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine]] (DFLP)&lt;ref name="Haaretz2007"&gt;Khoury, Jack. [http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/833554.html "U.S. filmmakers plan documentary on Ma'alot massacre"], ''[[Haaretz]]'', March 7, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; entered the Netiv Meir Elementary School, where they took more than 115 people (including 105 children) hostage on May 15, 1974, in Ma'alot. The hostage-takers soon issued demands for the release of 23 Palestinian militants from Israeli prisons, or else they would kill the students. On the second day of the [[Impasse|standoff]], a unit of the [[Golani Brigade]] stormed the building. During the takeover, the hostage-takers killed the children with grenades and automatic weapons. Ultimately, 25 hostages, including 22 children, were killed and 68 more were injured.

The [[Dolphinarium discotheque suicide bombing]] was a terrorist attack by on June 1, 2001 in which a [[suicide bomber]] Saeed Hotari, linked to the [[Palestinian nationalism|Palestinian]] group [[Hamas]], blew himself up outside a discotheque on a beachfront in [[Tel Aviv]], Israel, killing 21 Israeli teenagers and injuring 132.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ict.org.il/Articles/tabid/66/Articlsid/65/currentpage/22/Default.aspx|title=Publications|publisher=ICT|accessdate=April 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-48416289.html|title=No. 1 Hamas terrorist killed.

The [[Mercaz HaRav massacre]], also called the '''Mercaz HaRav shooting''', was an attack that occurred on March 6, 2008, in which a lone Palestinian gunman shot multiple students at the [[Mercaz HaRav]] [[yeshiva]], a school in [[Jerusalem]]. Eight students and the perpetrator were killed. Eleven more were wounded, five of them placed in serious to critical condition.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/7282269.stm Eight killed at Jerusalem school]", BBC News Online, March 6, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalterroralert.com/updates/2008/03/06/terror-attack-at-jerusalem-seminary-merkaz-harav-yeshiva-8-dead/ Terror Attack At Jerusalem Seminary – Merkaz HaRav Yeshiva – 8 Dead] National Terror Alert Response Center, March 6, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upi.com/NewsTrack/Top_News/2008/03/06/jerusalem_seminary_attacked/8267/ Jerusalem seminary attacked] UPI, March 6, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Other terrorist attacks targeting children included the [[Itamar attack]] in which six children and their parents were murdered in their beds, including a three-month-old infant,&lt;ref name="rallies"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/NationalNews/Article.aspx?id=211991 |title=Rallies held around country in response to Itamar attacks|work=The Jerusalem Post |accessdate=April 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 2011 [[Shaar HaNegev school bus attack]] in which Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip fired a Kornet laser-guided anti-tank missile over the border at an Israeli school bus, killing one child.&lt;ref name=apr9au&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/school-bus-attack-may-spark-gaza-war/story-e6frg6so-1226036217156 School bus attack may spark Gaza war], ''The Australian'' April 9, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal issues==
In 2010 [[Palestinian National Authority]] issued a "Report on the Implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child in the Occupied Palestinian Territory", i.e., the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza and noted the Authority's lack of jurisdiction over these areas and the Israel "closure regime", the "Israeli Wall of Annexation and Expansion" and the many checkpoints Israel has set up within the occupied territories. All make it difficult for Palestinians to stop Israeli violations of the rights of Palestinian children.&lt;ref name=PNAreport&gt;[http://resourcecentre.savethechildren.se/node/3834 Palestinian National Authority Report on the Implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child in the Occupied Palestinian Territory], December 2010, at the [[Save the Children]] website.&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to the Israeli military and prison service, at the end of February 2018 there were 356 Palestinian minors (defined as before 18th birthday) held as Israeli security detainees and prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.militarycourtwatch.org/page.php?id=J5V0bQevz8a19020AWwFbv7lxv2 |title=Military Court Watch |accessdate=April 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.btselem.org/statistics/minors_in_custody|accessdate=April 14, 2018| author = [[Btselem]] | title = Statistics on Palestinian minors in the custody of the Israeli security forces}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Applicable to Israelis and Palestinians is the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]], a [[international human rights instruments|human rights treaty]] setting out the civil, political, economic, social, health and cultural rights of children. The Convention defines a child as any human being under the age of eighteen, unless the state itself defines the [[age of majority]] as an earlier age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Convention on the Rights of the Child |url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm |publisher=Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm |archivedate=June 11, 2010 |df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israel ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1991.&lt;ref name=Kashti&gt;Or Kashti, [http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/unicef-israel-negligent-in-guarding-children-s-rights-1.325790 UNICEF: Israel negligent in guarding children's rights], ''[[Haaretz]]'', November 21, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Palestine did not have the status of a state, in 1995 [[Yassir Arafat]], as the representative of the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]], signed the Convention.&lt;ref name=PNAreport /&gt; The internationally accepted definition of children, codified in the [[United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child]] (CRC), defines children as individuals under the age of 18.

The law states that children under that age may not be arrested, and that children older than that age must not be interrogated unless their parents and their lawyer is present. The Israeli human rights monitoring group [[B'Tselem]] states that the law does not officially apply to Palestinian children in the Occupied Territories, who are subject to Israeli military law, but that the military court has recommended the provisions should be taken into consideration.&lt;ref name="B'tselem2013"&gt;{{cite web |title=Mass arrest of Palestinian children on their way to school in Hebron – at least 5 under the age of criminal responsibility |url=http://www.btselem.org/press_releases/20130320_minors_detained_in_hebron|publisher=B'Tselem|accessdate=March 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Gideon Levy]], these provisions are ignored in practice. A [[UNICEF]] report has stated that, "Ill-treatment of Palestinian children in the Israeli military detention system appears to be widespread, systematic and institutionalized," and that, "In no other country are children systematically tried by juvenile military courts."&lt;ref name="Alex Levac 2013"&gt;Gideon Levy and Alex Levac [http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/twilight-zone/aged-eight-wearing-a-mickey-mouse-sweatshirt-and-placed-in-israeli-custody.premium-1.512461 Aged eight, wearing a Mickey Mouse sweatshirt, and placed in Israeli custody], ''[[Haaretz]]'', March 29, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment of Palestinian children by the IDF==
[[Israel Defense Forces#Code of conduct|The Code of Conduct]] of the Israeli Defense Forces explicitly prohibits targeting non-combatants and dictates proportional force, stating, in part, that "The soldier shall make use of his weaponry and power only for the fulfillment of the mission and solely to the extent required; he will maintain his humanity even in combat. The soldier shall not employ his weaponry and power in order to harm non-combatants or prisoners of war, and shall do all he can to avoid harming their lives, body, honor and property."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dover.idf.il/IDF/English/about/doctrine/ethics.htm |title=Ethics – The IDF Spirit |publisher=[[IDF Spokesperson's Unit]] |accessdate=June 10, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090831080829/http://dover.idf.il/IDF/English/about/doctrine/ethics.htm |archivedate=August 31, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Philip E.

===Violence against children===
Since the Second Intifada, [[UNICEF]] (The United Nations Children's Fund), [[Amnesty International]], B'Tselem and individuals such as the British writer [[Derek Summerfield]], have called for Israel to protect children from violence in accordance with the [[Geneva conventions]]. The European Union has linked the suspension of Israel/Europe trade agreement talks to human rights issues, especially in regards to children.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/feb/25/israel-palestinian-territories Guardian] Upgrade Palestinian rights As it freezes an upgrade of relations with Israel, the EU should now demand respect for human rights, especially for children by Seth Freedman February 27, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, [[Breaking the Silence (non-governmental organization)|Breaking the Silence]], an organization founded by former Israeli soldiers whose purpose is to expose alleged abuses committed by the [[Israeli Defense Forces]] released a booklet of witness reports written by more than 30 former Israeli soldiers. These reports document of Palestinian children being beaten, intimidated, humiliated, verbally abused and injured by Israeli soldiers. Eran Efrati, a former IDF commander on the West Bank has said that ill-treatment of arrested children is routine. He himself admits to having arrested children aged 11 and over as though they were adults, with handcuffs and blindfolds:
&lt;blockquote&gt;'When the kid is sitting there in the base, I didn't do it, but nobody is thinking of him as a kid, you know—if there is someone blindfolded and handcuffed, he's probably done something really bad. It's OK to slap him, it's OK to spit on him, it's OK to kick him sometimes. It doesn't really matter.'&lt;ref name="BBC News"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8186905.stm 'Israeli troops 'ill-treat kids','] [[BBC News]] 6 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
700 of the 9,000 Palestinians arrested in 2013 were children.&lt;ref name="BBC News" /&gt; An Israeli Defense Forces spokesperson said the Breaking the Silence group had declined to provide the IDF with testimonies for verification, and Danny Lamm, president of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, said these types of testimonies are "anonymous ... devoid of critical detail and untested by any kind of cross-questioning."&lt;ref name="Guardian1"&gt;{{cite web |author=Harriet Sherwood |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/26/israeli-soldiers-mistreatment-palestinian-children |title=Former Israeli soldiers disclose routine mistreatment of Palestinian children |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=August 26, 2012 |accessdate=August 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/australian-jews-up-in-arms-about-israeli-ngo-report-on-idf-abuses.premium-1.462300 Australian Jews up in arms about Israeli NGO report on IDF abuses], ''[[Haaretz]]'', September 12, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The non-governmental organization, Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor, Accuse the Israeli forces of orchestring "their actions" to "humiliate and terrorize Palestinian children".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Human Rights Monitor|first1=Euro-Mediterranean|title=From Abduction to Prison|url=http://euromid.org/uploads/reports/Child-Palestine.pdf |publisher=Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor|accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Child detention===
In September 2009, after documentation emerged showing Palestinians children as young as 12 were prosecuted in adult military courts, Israel established a juvenile military court, 'the first and only juvenile military court in operation in the world.' Military Order 1651 establishes a maximum 6 months sentence for children aged 12–13, and 12 months for juniors aged 14–15, unless the offence involves throwing stones at persons or property with the intent to damage, in which case 10 years imprisonment is the maximum penalty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unicef.org/oPt/UNICEF_oPt_Children_in_Israeli_Military_Detention_Observations_and_Recommendations_-_6_March_2013.pdf 'Children in Israeli Military Detention Observations and Recommendations,'] February 2013 pp.6,8.&lt;/ref&gt;

In one case a 5-year-old child has been detailed on allegations he threw stones in Hebron. The IDF said that the boy had endangered passers-by and that soldiers only accompanied him to his parents. It stated that the child was not arrested and no charges were filed.&lt;ref&gt;Gili Cohen, [http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/watch-idf-soldiers-detain-five-year-old-palestinian-for-stone-throwing-in-hebron.premium-1.535260 'WATCH: IDF soldiers detain five-year-old Palestinian for stone-throwing in Hebron,'] ''[[Haaretz]]'', July 11, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://video.repubblica.it/mondo/gisgiordania-arrestato-a-5-anni-per-aver-tirato-una-pietra/134678/133218 'Cisgiordania, arrestato bambino di 5 anni per aver lanciato pietre contro un'auto,'] at ''[[La Repubblica]]'', July 11, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-23281567|title=Israel 'illegally detained' five-year-old Palestinian|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=April 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A separate study, conducted from 2005 until 2010 was released in mid-2011 by the Jerusalem-based non-profit [[B'Tselem]], found that the actions of the IDF potentially violated the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] and the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=B'Tselem |title=No Minor Matter Study 2011|url=http://www.btselem.org/publications/summaries/2011-no-minor-matter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When researching a story based on this study, [[The Guardian]] obtained a statement from Amir Ofek, the press attache for the Embassy of Israel in London. Ofek challenged these statements, writing, "When a minor involved in terrorist activity is arrested, the law is clear: no torture or humiliation is permitted, nor is solitary confinement in order to induce a confession." He further said that the DCI statement "[omits] the horrific nature of the atrocities that minors, some as young as 12, can be arrested for."&lt;ref name="1Guardian1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ofek|first=Amir|title=Israel does not mistreat detained Palestinian children|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/feb/02/israel-not-mistreat-palestinian-children|accessdate=March 11, 2013|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=February 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a March 2013 report by the [[United Nations Children's Fund]] ("UNICEF"), Israel has arrested some 7,000 Palestinian children; 18 of 27 arrested in Hebron in March 2013 were below the age of 12.&lt;ref name="Alex Levac 2013" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unicef.org/media/media_68093.html Palestinian children need improved protection in Israeli military detention], [[UNICEF]] Press release, March 6, 2013, plus link to report [http://www.unicef.org/oPt/UNICEF_oPt_Children_in_Israeli_Military_Detention_Observations_and_Recommendations_-_6_March_2013.pdf Children in Israeli military detention: observations and recommendations], February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The report was based on 400 cases documented since 2009. It stated that the Palestinian children who are detained by the Israeli military are subjected to "widespread, systematic and institutionalized" ill treatment in violation of international law. UNICEF estimated that in the [[West Bank]] IDF and Israeli security services annually arrest around 700 youths between 12 and 17 years old.  The report supported claims that the arrests were often made, without notice, in private homes at night. It reports that children are blindfolded, painfully restrained, and subjected to physical and verbal abuse while being detained, sometimes in solitary confinement.

The report further claims that, once in detention, they are interrogated and coerced into confession, without immediate access to a legal counsel or family members.&lt;ref name=Lubell&gt;{{cite news|last=Lubell|first=Maayan|title=Israel mistreats Palestinian children in custody: UNICEF|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/06/us-palestinians-israel-children-idUSBRE9250D520130306|access-date=March 11, 2013 |publisher=Reuters|date=March 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Signed confessions are typically typed in Hebrew, which few Palestinian minors can read. As of January 2013 Israeli military prisons held 233 males under 18, 31 under the age of 16.&lt;ref name=Fox&gt;{{cite news|title=UNICEF calls on Israel to reform detention policies for Palestinian minors|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2013/03/06/unicef-calls-on-israel-to-reform-detention-policies-for-palestinian-minors/|access-date=March 11, 2013 |publisher=Fox News|date=March 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally children are shackled during court appearances and made to serve sentences in Israel. UNICEF stated these findings "amount to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment according to the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention against Torture".&lt;ref name=Lubell /&gt;

About 60 percent of arrested minors are charged with throwing rocks at soldiers or passing cars,&lt;ref name=Fox /&gt; which the IDF regards as a form of terrorism as it has led to the death and injury of Israelis, including of children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Israeli army arrests Palestinians suspected of rock-throwing; Israeli infant badly injured|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2013/03/15/israeli-army-arrests-palestinians-suspected-rock-throwing-israeli-infant-badly/|accessdate=April 12, 2013|publisher=Fox News|date=March 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UNICEF report noted that Israel had made some positive changes over recent years, such as hand tying measures that do not cause pain or injury.&lt;ref name=Lubell /&gt; It urged Israel to refrain from blindfolding minors and holding them in solitary confinement, to permit an attorney or family member to attend interrogations, and to record interrogations to document any false claims of abuse. Israel's Foreign Ministry said Israel's military was already making changes to cooperate with the United Nations, including reducing holding time before seeing a judge to 48 hours, telling parents about arrest of children, and informing children of their right to consult a lawyer. UNICEF replied that the changes were insufficiently specific.&lt;ref name=Fox /&gt; Israeli Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor stated that "Israel will study the conclusions and will work to implement them through ongoing cooperation with UNICEF, whose work we value and respect".&lt;ref name=Lubell /&gt; In October,2013 UNICEF reported that the IDF was introducing changes in its arrest of minors in a pilot-test programme, but according to ''Haaretz'' the policy had not at that date been implemented and was still under study.&lt;ref&gt;Gili Cohen, [http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/1.552831 'Israeli army taking steps to change Palestinian child arrest policy,'] ''Haaretz'', October 16, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

January 2015, Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor has issued a press release about Israeli detention of a [[Palestinians|Palestinian]] girl. The monitor said that Malak Al-Khatib, 14 year old-Palestinian girl, has been imprisoned by [[Israel Defense Forces|Israeli authorities]] for 22 consecutive days without contact with her parents, and has just been sentenced to serve another month along with a stiff fine on her parents. In addition, the monitor said that another four [[child]]ren as young as 11 were recently held for four hours under threat of [[Detention (imprisonment)|detention]] and death. The Euro-Med Monitor has condemned Israel's policy of detaining children and subjecting them to abusive and inhumane treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.euromedmonitor.org/en/article/698/Palestinian-girl-imprisoned-for-two-months--four-other-children-threatened-by-Israeli-Authorities|title=Pallestinian Girl Imprisoned for Two Months, Four Other Children Threatened by Israeli Authorities |access-date=February 22, 2016|publisher=Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human shields===
Amnesty International's report into the 2008 [[Gaza War (2008–09)|Gaza War]] stated that they had found instances in which the IDF endangered the lives of civilians, including children, by using them as [[human shield]]s. The report discussed examples such as "forcing them to remain in or near houses which they took over and used as military positions. Some were forced to carry out dangerous tasks such as inspecting properties or objects suspected of being booby-trapped."&lt;ref name=AACL&gt;{{cite web|title=Israel/Gaza- Operation Cast Lead: 22Days of Death and Destruction|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde15/015/2009/en/|publisher=Amnesty international|accessdate=March 16, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Israeli military denied the allegations saying "The IDF operated in accordance with the rules of war and did the utmost to minimize harm to civilians uninvolved in combat.

Both soldiers received three months probation and a demotion in rank.

According to the [[Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers]]' "2004 Global Report on the Use of Child Soldiers" there was "no evidence of systematic recruitment of children by Palestinian armed groups." However, there were incidents where children were involved in suicide attacks or other militant operations.&lt;ref name="Child Soldiers Global Report 2004"&gt;[http://www.child-soldiers.org/global_report_reader.php?id=281 Child Soldiers Global Report 2004] [[Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers]], pp. 292, 304&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Human Rights Watch]], in 2004, the major Palestinian armed groups, including [[Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade]], the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]], [[Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine|Islamic Jihad]], and [[Hamas]] "have publicly disavowed the use of children in military operations, but those stated policies have not always been implemented." In part this is because some leaders state they consider children of 16 to be adults.&lt;ref name=HRW2004 /&gt; In 2005 [[Amnesty International]] condemned the use of children by Palestinian militant groups saying: "Palestinian armed groups have repeatedly shown total disregard for the most fundamental human rights, notably the right to life, by deliberately targeting Israeli civilians and by using Palestinian children in armed attacks."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/ar/documents/mde15/033/2005/ar/ Public Statement: Israel/Occupied Territories: Palestinian armed groups must not use children], [[Amnesty International]], May 23, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human shields===
During the [[Second Intifada]] (2000–2005) ''[[Haaretz]]'' reported that Palestinian militant gunmen used civilians and children as [[human shield]]s by surrounding themselves with children while shooting at [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/analysis-stoking-an-appetite-for-revenge-1.116136 |title=Analysis / Stoking an appetite for revenge |work=[[Haaretz]] |date=August 3, 2004 |accessdate=March 16, 2013 |author=Harel, Amos |quote=The photographs from recent operations show that the armed Palestinians use the many civilians in the area, including children, as a "human shield".

In a 2006 incident the [[Israeli Air Force]] warned Mohammed Weil Baroud, a Palestinian leader accused by Israel of firing [[Qassam rocket]]s at Israel, to evacuate his home in [[Beit Lahia]] in the Gaza Strip in advance of an Israeli [[airstrike]]. Instead, hundreds of Palestinians, including many women and children, gathered outside Baroud's house. Israel suspended the airstrike out of fear that the civilians would be killed or injured. A senior Hamas official said the new tactic was taken because in previous months Israel has destroyed 58 houses and more than 240 people had been left homeless. After Israel called off the strike, another Palestinian leader said: "We have won. From now on we will form human chains around every house that is threatened with demolition."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=41818 Gaza: Use of human shields continues]", ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'', November 19, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the Guardian reported that the Israeli military "accused a faction of Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement of using an 11-year-old boy as an unwitting human bomb after the child was discovered carrying explosive through an army checkpoint in Nablus.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/mar/17/israel1 Israelis say boy, 11, used as bomber], ''[[The Guardian]]'', March 17, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, a 14-year-old was captured by Israeli soldiers and told of being given $23 and a suicide bomber's vest. His family said he was gullible and easily manipulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/03/25/world/main608756.shtml|title=Teen Bomber Stopped At West Bank|date=March 25, 2004|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=April 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shafiq Masalha, a clinical psychologist who teaches at [[Tel Aviv University]], wrote in 2004 that 15 percent of Palestinian children dreamt of becoming suicide bombers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldpress.org/Mideast/1946.cfm The Children's Crusade], ''[[World Press Review]]'', September 29, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Eyad Sarraj, Palestinian psychiatrist and director of the Gaza Community Mental Health Program, a survey by his program found that 36 percent of Palestinians over 12 aspired to die "a martyr's death" fighting Israel.&lt;ref name="TheAge"&gt;{{cite news|title=Angry uncle leads uproar on the hesitant boy bomber|work=[[The Age]]|date=March 27, 2004|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/03/26/1079939847304.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former UN Under-Secretary General [[Olara Otunnu]] stated in 2003: "We have witnessed both ends of these acts: children have been used as suicide bombers and children have been killed by suicide bombings. I call on the Palestinian authorities to do everything within their powers to stop all participation by children in this conflict."&lt;ref&gt;Radler, Melissa, "UN condemns Palestinians' use of children in conflict," ''Jerusalem Post'', January 15, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manipulation of children===
According to some sources, Hamas uses children to transport weaponry and to perpetrate acts of violence against Israeli soldiers and civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Matthew Levitt]]|title=Hamas: Politics, Charity, And Terrorism in the Service of Jihad|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CG-AjU3rraQC&amp;pg=PA111&amp;lpg=PA111&amp;dq=palestinian+child+couriers&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=BQ0hCtcX0N&amp;sig=hwdh2Z1uiV2CoqKJD7Cu4X4hK5g&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=o6VoUcL1L5TRqAGTkoCYCQ&amp;ved=0CGcQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=palestinian%20child%20couriers&amp;f=false|accessdate=April 12, 2013|date=March 22, 2007|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-12258-9|pages=111–}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes grenade throwing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-4145140,00.html|title=ynet מאיר דגן נזכר בסיירת רימון: "הרגנו עשרות רבות" - חדשות|work=ynet|accessdate=April 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; rock throwing, and stabbing attacks.&lt;ref name="1Guardian1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mfa.gov.il"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/mfa/peace%20process/guide%20to%20the%20peace%20process/hebron%20-%20background|title=Hebron-Background|work=GxMSDev|accessdate=April 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, the [[Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers]] wrote that "children are used as messengers and couriers, and in some cases as fighters and suicide bombers in attacks on Israeli soldiers and civilians. All the main political groups involve children in this way, including Fatah, Hamas, Islamic Jihad, and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine."&lt;ref name="Child Soldiers Global Report 2004" /&gt;

An Israeli army report accused Palestinian groups of exploiting children by using them for "smuggling, digging tunnels, spying and intelligence-gathering" and by inciting them to violence, as their youthful appearance allows them to more easily approach soldiers and get through check points.&lt;ref name="JVL2004"&gt;{{cite news|title=Exploiting Young Arabs for Terror|publisher=Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs|year=2003|url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/2000_2009/2003/1/Participation%20of%20Children%20and%20Teenagers%20in%20Terrori}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report also noted that much of Palestinian society disapproves of these methods, but accused the Palestinian Authority of not taking appropriate measures to prevent their occurrence.&lt;ref name="JVL2004" /&gt;

The [[First Intifada]] of mass protests and rioting by [[Palestinian people|Palestinians]] in the occupied [[West Bank]], [[East Jerusalem]] and [[Gaza City|Gaza]] started in 1987, and children frequently participated. In an article in the London Review of Books, American professors [[John Mearsheimer]] and [[Stephen Walt]] claimed that the [[Israel Defense Forces]] ("IDF") encouraged troops to break protesters' bones. The Swedish branch of [[Save the Children]] estimated that during the first two years of the intifada, between 23,600 and 29,900 children required medical treatment for such beating injuries and that nearly a third were under the age of ten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Israel Lobby|journal=[[London Review of Books]]|last1=Mearsheimer|author1-link=John Mearsheimer|first1=John |last2=Walt|first2=Stephen|author2-link=Stephen Walt|volume=28|issue=6|year=2006|url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v28/n06/john-mearsheimer/the-israel-lobby|pages=3–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs lists 24 Israeli child fatalities between 1993 and 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Terrorism-+Obstacle+to+Peace/Palestinian+terror+before+2000/Fatal+Terrorist+Attacks+in+Israel+Since+the+DOP+-S.htm|title=Fatal Terrorist Attacks in Israel (Sept 1993–1999)|work=GxMSDev |accessdate=April 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects on children==

===Child indoctrination===
A comprehensive three-year study (2009–2012) of [[Textbooks in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict|Israeli and Palestinian textbooks]], regarded by its researchers as "the most definitive and balanced study to date on the topic,"&lt;ref name="Sherwood"&gt;Harriet Sherwood, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/04/israeli-palestinian-textbooks-borders 'Israeli and Palestinian textbooks omit borders,']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Danielle Ziri, [http://www.jpost.com/NationalNews/Article.aspx?id=302102 'Textbooks show both sides to blame for enmity,'] at ''[[Jerusalem Post]]'', February 4, 2013: '"The Israeli-Palestinian schoolbook study is among the most comprehensive, fact-based investigations ever done of school text books," the researchers, Wexler, Bar-Tal and Adwan said in a statement.'&lt;/ref&gt; found that incitement, demonization or negative depictions of the other in children's education was "extremely rare" in both Israeli and Palestinian school texts, with only 6 instances discovered in over 9,964 pages of Palestinian textbooks, none of which consisted of "general dehumanising characterisations of personal traits of Jews or Israelis".&lt;ref name="Sherwood" /&gt; Israeli officials rejected the study as biased, while Palestinian Authority officials claimed it vindicated their view that their textbooks are as fair and balanced as Israel's.&lt;ref name="Sanders"&gt;Edmund Sanders, [http://www.latimes.com/news/world/worldnow/la-fg-wn-israeli-palestinian-textbooks-unbalanced-20130204,0,3549890.story 'Israeli and Palestinian textbooks fail balance test, study finds,'] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', February 4, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The study, published in 2013 by the [[Munib Younan|Council for Religious Institutions in the Holy Land]], an interfaith association of Jewish, Christian, and Muslim leaders in Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza, produced different results. The study was supervised by a psychiatrist, Prof. emeritus [[Bruce Wexler]] of [[Yale University]] and his NGO, ''A Different Future'', and a joint Palestinian-Israeli research team, headed by Professors [[Daniel Bar-Tal]] ([[Tel Aviv University]]) and [[Sami Adwan]] ([[Bethlehem University]]), was commissioned. Six Israeli and four Palestinian bilingual research assistants were employed to analyze the texts of 370 Israeli and 102 Palestinian books from grades 1 to 12. The study found that, while most schoolbooks on either side were factually accurate, both Israel and the Palestinians failed to adequately and positively represent each other,&lt;ref name="Sanders" /&gt; and presented "exclusive unilateral national narratives".&lt;ref name="Australian"&gt;AAP, [http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/breaking-news/israeli-palestinian-textbooks-one-sided/story-fn3dxix6-1226570726519 Israeli, Palestinian textbooks 'one-sided'] [[Australian Associated Press|AAP]]/''[[The Australian]]'', February 5, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; It was found that 40 percent of Israeli and 15 percent of Palestinian textbooks were judged to contain neutral depictions of the other, whereas negative characterizations were discerned in 26 percent of Israeli state school books and 50 percent of the Palestinian ones.&lt;ref name="Ziri"&gt;Danielle Ziri, [http://www.jpost.com/NationalNews/Article.aspx?id=302102 'Textbooks show both sides to blame for enmity,'] ''[[Jerusalem Post]]'', February 4, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Israeli schoolbooks were deemed superior to Palestinian ones with regard to preparing children for peace, but the study praised both Israel and the Palestinian Authority for producing textbooks almost completely unblemished by "dehumanizing and demonizing characterizations of the other".&lt;ref name="Australian" /&gt;

In 2006 the [[Anti-Defamation League]] wrote that Hamas' four-year-old bi-weekly on-line magazine for children, al-Fatah (Arabic for "the conqueror"), featured stories and columns praising suicide bombers and attacks against the "Jewish enemy."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adl.org/main_Terrorism/al_fateh_hamas.htm Hamas Magazine for Kids Promotes Martyrdom and Hatred] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110804222805/http://www.adl.org/main_Terrorism/al_fateh_hamas.htm |date=August 4, 2011 }}, [[Anti-Defamation League]] website, March 14, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 Hamas refused to allow Palestinian children to learn about the Holocaust, which it called "a lie invented by the Zionists" and referred to Holocaust education as a "war crime."&lt;ref&gt;[http://jta.org/news/article/2009/08/31/1007549/hamas-condemns-un-for-teaching-the-holocaust#When:14:44:00Z "Hamas rips U.N. for teaching the Holocaust."] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090904093310/http://jta.org/news/article/2009/08/31/1007549/hamas-condemns-un-for-teaching-the-holocaust#When:14:44:00Z |date=September 4, 2009}} [[Jewish Telegraphic Agency|JTA]].

More than 37,000 Palestinian boys, aged 15–17, took part in a Hamas youth training program during the 2012–13 academic year, which has become part of the official state educational curriculum since September 2012. Its purpose is to "initiate a new generation of Palestinian men in the struggle against Israel" and included fighting skills, firing a rifle and first aid. The program includes contributions by the [[al-Qassam Brigades]].&lt;ref name="hamasyouth"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/palestinianauthority/10023810/Hamas-teaches-Palestinian-schoolboys-how-to-fire-Kalashnikovs.html|title=Hamas teaches Palestinian schoolboys how to fire Kalashnikovs|date=April 28, 2013|work=Telegraph|accessdate=April 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2013 more than 3,000 Palestinian teenagers graduated from Hamas's first high school military training program in the Gaza Strip. Hamas officials said the program, which is an elective course, is aimed at creating a new generation of leaders to struggle against Israel. According to Abu Hozifa, a 29-year-old national security officer who teaches in the program, children are taught to "honor the national flag and anthem, to strengthen their affinity with the homeland and Jerusalem, the spirit of resistance and the principles of steadfastness. We also prepare them in terms of faith and physical fitness to serve as resistance fighters if they want to be in the future."&lt;ref&gt;Barzak, Ibrahim.

Hamas also runs a two-week camp for 5,000 boys at a Hamas military base. The boys are dressed in military-style uniforms and trained by members of the Hamas National Guard and militants from Hamas' armed wing, the al-Qassam Brigades. They learn karate, street-fighting, and how to throw a [[hand grenade]].&lt;ref name="hamasyouth" /&gt;

In 2000, 25,000 Palestinian teenagers learned "kidnapping, ambushing and using assault weapons" at a summer camp run by [[Yassir Arafat]]'s staff who deal with [[psychological warfare]]. Lt. General [[Shaul Mofaz]], the IDF's Chief of the General Staff, regarded the camps as "evidence of the risks of a new Palestinian upheaval". The Arafat aide who oversees the camps compared the camps to the Israeli Gadna corps for teenagers and said "We hope that we will achieve our rights through negotiations, so that summer camps like these will cease to exist. ... There is nothing we want more than a full and genuine peace, including Jerusalem, which would allow us to end the weapons-training and concentrate instead on teaching our young people about computers, and swimming and other recreations."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/03/world/palestinian-summer-camp-offers-the-games-of-war.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm Palestinian Summer Camp Offers the Games of War], ''New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, a children performed a song at a kindergarten graduation ceremony in the West Bank which included these lyrics: "If you stretch your hand, it will be chopped off. If you just look with your eye, it will be gouged out. ... We come for you before, and woe betide you if we come back again. You come to this land alive, but you will leave it as body part."&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, Abraham.

Dr. [[Nurit Peled-Elhanan]], of the Tel Aviv University School of Education has said the [[Gadna (Israel)|Gadna]] military program for high school students "makes it clear, in no uncertain terms, at the supreme value is the state, and that the norms are established by the state and the army, whatever they may be ... there is no room for hesitation, for criticism or any signs of these. All, including the parents, must contribute to the effort of conscription." [[Hebrew University]] Professor Matanya Ben Artzi, whose son was arrested for resisting conscription, said "This is a takeover by the army of the high school, that is meant to be the foundation for a civil society." Education Minister [[Yuli Tamir]] said "We educate the pupils to civil and social commitment to the state, which includes military service. If the IDF is helping us encourage this outlook of commitment, then I will support the program."&lt;ref name="haaretz" /&gt;

According to Michael Kaplan and Gideon Levy, during a weapons display held on Israel's 66th Independence Day in [[Efrat]], numerous photos showed Israeli children dressed in military attire and holding weapons. According to Kaplan, this indicates that not only Palestinian, but groups of Israeli children 'learn to glory violence and aspire towards violence'.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Kaplan, [http://blogs.forward.com/forward-thinking/197866/when-israelis-teach-their-kids-to-hate/ 'When Israelis Teach Their Kids To Hate,'] ''[[The Jewish Daily Forward]]'', 8 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Gideon Levy]],[http://www.haaretz.com/opinion/.premium-1.589407 'Parental love, Israelil-style'] ''[[Haaretz]]'', 7 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Israeli Professor Edward Kaufman&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cidcm.umd.edu/about/people/profile.aspx?id=11 Profile of Professor Edward Kaufman], University of Maryland website, accessed April 22, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; has written that Israel's faith in military superiority, its use of "extra-judicial executions" or "targeted elimination" of suspects that often result in [[collateral damage|deaths of innocents]], has exacerbated the conflict. He writes it has resulted in the fact that "Israeli schoolchildren are among the most violent in the world, a phenomenon believed to be the result of force being an accepted societal means of dispute resolution. An astonishing 43 percent of Israeli children have admitted to bullying others, while one in four Israeli boys admitted to carrying a knife to school for protection. It is only to be expected that Israel's use of overwhelming force to deal with the Palestinians has had a trickle-down effect on society. The culture of violence prevalent in Israel has had a dramatic impact on the most impressionable members of the community: children."&lt;ref name="Kaufman"&gt;Edward Kaufman, "Merging the Human Rights Dimension into Peace Making – Is it good for the Jews", Chapter 9 of Elizabeth Matthews, ''The Israel–Palestine Conflict: Parallel Discourses'', Taylor &amp; Francis, 2011, [https://books.google.com/books?id=-ubfEsbawzoC&amp;pg=PA179 p. 179], access date April 22, 2013, {{ISBN|978-1-136-88432-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, a joint study of Palestinian, Jewish-Israeli and Arab-Israeli children found that exposure to political conflict and violence contributed to an increase in aggressive behavior. According to the study, "Palestinian children were at the greatest risk for exposure to violence across settings as well as at the highest level of aggressive behavior in comparison to the two other groups. Males were uniformly at greater risk than were females for all forms of exposure to violence as well as more aggressive."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmc=3505223 |pmid=22906188 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2012.01848.x |volume=84 |title=Exposure to violence across the social ecosystem and the development of aggression: a test of ecological theory in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict |journal=Child Dev |pages=163–77 |last1=Boxer |first1=P |last2=Rowell Huesmann |first2=L |last3=Dubow |first3=EF |last4=Landau |first4=SF |last5=Gvirsman |first5=SD |last6=Shikaki |first6=K |last7=Ginges |first7=J|url=https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/96242/1/cdev1848.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ben Gurion Beer Ora 1957.jpg|thumb|200|[[David Ben Gurion]] visiting a [[Gadna (Israel)|Gadna]] base in [[Be'er Ora]] (1957). Gadna is a one-week Israeli military program to prepare youth for their mandatory military service in the Israel Defense Forces or Border Police.&lt;ref name="haaretz" /&gt;]]
[[Gadna (Israel)|Gadna]] is an Israeli pre-army military program to prepare high school students for their mandatory service. Gadna was created before the [[Declaration of Independence (Israel)|Israeli declaration of independence]]. During the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]], trainees served as combatants. Until 1990, Gadna focused on instilling patriotic values in Israeli youth and encouraging immigration of youth to Israel. Nowadays, the program concentrates on increasing motivation to serve in the Army.&lt;ref name="jpgadna"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Gadna-pre-army-program-tries-to-restore-IDFs-appeal|title=Gadna pre-army program tries to restore IDF's appeal|work=The Jerusalem Post |accessdate=April 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2007, an estimated minority&lt;ref name="jpgadna" /&gt; of 16,000 to 19,000 11th grade pupils annually engage in squad-sized operations, night treks and shooting, with the promise of rewards for excellence when the youth join the Israel Defense Forces. Educators have criticized the program as "overly militaristic". The one-week-long program was revised in 2007 to include lessons in combat doctrine, the [[purity of arms]] and ethics in combat.&lt;ref name="haaretz"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/807850.html|title=New IDF Gadna youth program criticized as overly militaristic|work=[[Haaretz]] |author=Kashti, Or|date=January 1, 2007|accessdate=August 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Israeli-Palestinian conflict, however, has been found to have negative impacts on children's health and medical care.

The Unit of Emergency Medicine from Schneider Children's Medical Center of Israel performed a two-year research and review surrounding the medical care of child terror victims. The results, which were published in 2003, stated, "During the study period, 41 mass-casualty events (MCEs) were managed by Magen David Adom. Each event involved on average, 32 regular and nine mobile intensive care unit ambulances with 93 medics, 19 paramedics, and four physicians. Evacuation time was 5–10 minutes in urban areas and 15–20 minutes in rural areas. In most cases, victims were evacuated to multiple facilities.

In 2004 psychiatrist [[Derek Summerfield]] wrote in an opinion piece in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' that the then-recent Israeli military reoccupation of the West Bank and Gaza divided communities by "[[Israeli checkpoint|checkpoints]]", put up massive walls like the [[Israeli West Bank barrier]] and the [[Israel and Egypt – Gaza Strip barrier|Gaza Strip barrier]] and demolished 60,000 homes. The [[World Bank]] estimated that due to these actions Palestinian poverty had tripled in three years with 60% of the population subsisting at poverty level and over half of households eating just one meal daily. The barrier was isolating 97 primary health clinics and 11 hospitals from Palestinian patients. During that time there were 87 cases in which denial of access to medical treatment caused death, including to 30 children, some babies born while women in labor were kept at checkpoints. Summerfield said that [[Physicians for Human Rights-Israel]] has criticized the [[Israel Medical Association]] for its silence on these issues.&lt;ref&gt;Derek Summerfield, [http://www.bmj.com/content/329/7471/924?ijkey=a8226af1022ebb0cadde58e68d909f684dd5c9b3&amp;keytype2=tf_ipsecsha Personal View: Palestine: the assault on health and other war crimes], October 14, 2004;([http://www.zcommunications.org/palestine-the-assault-on-health-and-other-war-crimes-by-derek-summerfield copy readable without registration] at [[Z Communications]] website.)&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2009 [[The Lancet]] medical journal report, authored by Dr. Awad Mataria and Dr. Hanan Abdul Rahim, described the healthcare system in the Palestinian territories as "fragmented and incoherent".  Dr. Rahim said there were gaps in care, a low level of post-natal care, and little decline infant mortality rates compared with other Arab countries that had been able to bring them down. The report cited a United Nations' report that stated more than 60 Palestinian women had given birth at Israeli checkpoints and 36 of their babies died as a result. The physicians blamed conditions of military occupation, Palestinian political instability, inconsistent and fragmented foreign aid donor policies and a focus on emergency aid, as opposed to long-term development inside the Palestinian territories.&lt;ref name=BBC2009&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7924199.stm Palestinian health care 'ailing'], [[BBC]], Thursday, March 5, 2009; this was one article in ''The Lancet'' series [http://www.thelancet.com/series/health-in-the-occupied-palestinian-territory Health in the Occupied Palestinian Territory 2009], launched March 4, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Health Organization]] reports regularly on health care in the "occupied Palestinian territory."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/hac/crises/international/wbgs/en/ The occupied Palestinian territory, Situation reports archives], [[World Health Organization]] website.&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the Summerfield opinion piece, Irwin Mansdorf, a member of ''Task Force on Medical and Public Health Issues, Scholars for Peace in the Middle East'' wrote an opinion piece about routine care that Palestinians continue to receive in Israeli hospitals and from Israeli physicians, saying that "Palestinians receive care in Israel that they could not receive in any neighboring Arab country. In the last few months alone nearly 200 Palestinian children who were referred under a joint Israeli-Palestinian programme to treat children with serious medical conditions have already undergone major surgery at Israeli hospitals at no cost to the families. Another 350–400 Palestinian children have undergone free diagnostic testing."&lt;ref&gt;Irwin Mansdorf, [http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/329/7474/1102-a?ck=nck Personal View: Palestine: the assault on health and other war crimes: Summerfield's outrage is misplaced], ''[[The BMJ]]'', November 4, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Simon M Fellerman also wrote one noting that ''Saving Children'', established by the [[Peres Center for Peace]], enables hundreds of Palestinian children to receive free medical care, in particular cardiac surgery, from Israeli surgeons.&lt;ref&gt;Simon M Fellerman, [http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/329/7474/1110?ck=nck Personal View: Palestinian health: the truth, the lies, and the statistics], ''[[The BMJ]]'', November 4, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the Lancet report, an Israeli government spokesperson said that Palestinians in the territories could receive medical care in Israel itself, noting that 28,000 Palestinians from Gaza had been treated in Israel during the two years covered by the Lancet report.&lt;ref name=BBC2009 /&gt;

In a 2003 United Nations report, [[Special Rapporteur (UN)|Special Rapporteur]] [[Jean Ziegler]] reported that over 22 per cent of children under 5 in the Palestinian territories were suffering from malnutrition and 15.6 per cent from acute [[anaemia]]." According to the [[World Bank]], food consumption in the Palestinian Territories fell by more than 25 per cent per capita, and food shortages particularly of proteins, were reported.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhchr.ch/pdf/chr60/10add2AV.pdf Economic, social and cultural rights – The right to food] [[Jean Ziegler]]. United Nations Commission of Human Rights. October 31, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; A 2007 [[Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics]] poll of Palestinian children in the West Bank and Gaza found that as a result of poverty about 10 percent of Palestinian children suffer "permanent effects from malnutrition", including especially stunted growth.&lt;ref name="haaretz.com" /&gt; In 2010 the Danish government sponsored a survey that found that 10 percent of children in Gaza are malnourished.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/israel/7806209/Dispatch-Just-how-hungry-is-Gaza.html Dispatch: Just how hungry is Gaza?], ''The Telegraph'', June 5, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, the Israel Defense Forces spokesperson's office made available to the media comments by the deputy director of the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] in the Gaza Strip, who the IDF reported had said that there is "no humanitarian crisis in Gaza. If you go to the supermarket, there are products. There are restaurants and a nice beach." She further said that problems caused by the blockade were "mainly in maintenance of infrastructure and in access to goods, concrete for example."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/red-cross-official-gaza-isn-t-experiencing-a-humanitarian-crisis-1.357268 Red Cross official: Gaza isn't experiencing a humanitarian crisis], ''[[Haaretz]]'', April 21, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/MiddleEast/Article.aspx?id=217460 Red Cross: There is no humanitarian crisis in Gaza], ''[[Jerusalem Post]]'', April 21, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christian Science Monitor]] staff writer Dan Murphy interviewed the spokeswoman for the Red Cross, Cecilia Goin, who said the comments were not provided in full context and thus gave the inaccurate impression "that everything was OK" when in fact the situation was still "dire." Murphy, who has been to Gaza, wrote that products in supermarkets and restaurants were "out of reach" for most Gazans. He wrote: "In this context the "no humanitarian crisis" means that people in Gaza aren't starving, which is certainly true. The United Nation's Relief and Works Agency provides aid to most of Gaza's 1.5 million people, and has been allowed to bring in food and medical supplies. The Red Cross and other aid groups are active as well." He also noted that a 2008 United States diplomatic cable released by [[WikiLeaks]] stated that "Israeli officials have confirmed to Embassy officials on multiple occasions that they intend to keep the Gazan economy functioning at the lowest level possible consistent with avoiding a humanitarian crisis".&lt;ref&gt;Dan Murphy, [http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Backchannels/2011/0706/Did-the-Red-Cross-say-there-s-no-humanitarian-crisis-in-Gaza Did the Red Cross say there's no humanitarian crisis in Gaza?], ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'', July 6, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2012 report jointly issued by aid organizations [[Save the Children]] and Britain's [[Medical Aid for Palestinians]] found that 10 percent of Gaza children under five had stunted growth due to malnutrition and that 68 percent of pre-school children and 58 percent of children of school age suffered from anaemia. The report stated that the five-year blockade of Gaza Strip, which has prevented importation of necessary supplies and materials, as well as Israel's [[Gaza War (2008–09)|Gaza War]] bombing of infrastructure, has led to water being severely contaminated by fertilizer and human waste. Diseases like [[typhoid]] and [[diarrhea]], spread by contaminated water, have doubled in children under the age of 3, which has long-term health implications.&lt;ref name=Villarreal /&gt;&lt;ref name=STChildren&gt;[http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/resources/online-library/gazas-children-falling-behind Gaza's Children: Falling behind], Report of [[Save the Children]] and Britain's [[Medical Aid for Palestinians]], June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Open sewage is a problem and in 2012 three children drowned in pools of it.&lt;ref name=STChildren /&gt;&lt;ref name=Chernikoff&gt;[http://www.thejewishweek.com/blogs/yad/mea-culpa-media A Mea Culpa From The Media] ''[[The Jewish Week]]'', November 18, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012 an Israeli human rights group forced Israel to disclose a 2008 document that calculated that Gaza's 1.5 million inhabitants needed 2,279 calories per person a day to avoid malnutrition and widespread starvation. The Israeli military disputes critics' claims it used the guidelines during its blockade of Gaza to restrict food shipments to Gaza in order to put pressure on Hamas.&lt;ref name=APCalories&gt;[http://articles.nydailynews.com/2012-10-17/news/34532367_1_guy-inbar-gisha-gaza-residents Military counted Gaza residents' calories during Israeli blockade], [[Associated Press]], October 17, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The committee was discussing the effects of the terror attacks of the past 32 months on children. Laufer's findings were based on a study of some 3,000 children aged 13 to 15, from both sides of the "Green Line". Some 70 percent of the children said that the terror attacks had had a direct impact on their lives, causing them to abandon or avoid certain activities.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=300638&amp;contrassID=2&amp;subContrassID=1&amp;sbSubContrassID=0&amp;listSrc=Y ''Haaretz''] June 5, 2003 Terror leaves 42% of children with PTSD By Gideon Alon&lt;/ref&gt; Gaza Community Health Programs carried out a study and found that Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) rate for children in Gaza was that 54% suffered from severe PTSD, 33.5% from moderate and 11% from mild and doubtful levels of PTSD.&lt;ref name="DIPTSD" /&gt; In a report, published in the Canadian Journal of Psychiatry, it was estimated that the rate of psychological morbidity in the southern region of [[Bethlehem]] in the West Bank, to be 42.3% among Palestinian children.

According to some reports, more than 370,000 Palestinian children have been left shell-shocked by 2014 Israeli war on Gaza.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/gaza/11372893/Hundreds-of-thousands-of-children-shell-shocked-after-the-war-in-Gaza.html|title=Hundreds of thousands of children shell-shocked after the war in Gaza|date=January 28, 2015|work=Telegraph |accessdate=April 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Israeli professor Edward Kaufman has written that widespread PTSD among Israeli children is caused by "the environment of fear resulting from indiscriminate acts of terror."&lt;ref name="Kaufman"/&gt; According to an Israeli child psychiatrist, about half of the children in Jerusalem, the city hit hardest by Palestinian violence, experience symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, two to three times higher than the rate of children suffering from other causes of trauma. A recent study by Herzog's trauma centre found that 33 per cent of Israeli youth have been affected personally by terrorism, either by being at the scene of an attack or by knowing someone injured or killed by terrorists. Seventy per cent of those surveyed reported increased subjective fear or hopelessness.&lt;ref name="substantiate1"&gt;[http://www.ajn.com.au/pages/archives/feature/feature-01l.html ANJ.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041210144306/http://www.ajn.com.au/pages/archives/feature/feature-01l.html |date=December 10, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have found high levels of PTSD in southern Israel which is frequently attacked by rockets and mortars from the Gaza Strip.

==Media manipulation==
{{see also| Pallywood}}
Some images of children in the conflict have been shown to be false, digitally altered, or outdated, and are used to manipulate public sentiment.

During the [[March 2012 Gaza–Israel clashes]], Khulood Badawi, an Information and Media Coordinator for the United Nations [[Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs]], tweeted a picture of a Palestinian child covered in blood. She was criticized because the child was 5-year-old Raja Abu Shaban, who was killed in 2006 when she fell from a swing, and not in an Israeli attack.&lt;ref&gt;Sheera Frenkel, [http://northiowatoday.com/?p=12254 Tweets of misleading photos feed Israeli-Palestinian feud], [[The McClatchy Company]], March 14, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hadid" /&gt; Badawi later tweeted that she mistakenly had tweeted an old photo.&lt;ref&gt;Herb Keinon, [http://www.jpost.com/International/Article.aspx?id=262541 No sign UN will fire worker over incendiary tweet], ''Jerusalem Post'', March 20, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ma'an News Agency]] reported the hospital medical report on the dead girl stated she died "due to falling from a high area during the Israeli strike on Gaza". Interviews with relatives, news reports and investigations by human rights organizations also suggest that her death indirectly was caused by an Israeli air strike as little as 100 meters away, though accounts differ on how this occurred. Israeli officials have said that the girl's death had nothing to do with Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Charlotte Alfred, [http://www.maannews.net/eng/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=471498 Twitter flap obscures details of Gaza girl's death], [[Ma'an News Agency]], March 27, 2012 (updated) 01/04/2012 09:31&lt;/ref&gt;

One day later, [[Ofir Gendelman]], a spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]], tweeted a photo of an Israeli woman and her two children ducking a Gaza rocket describing it as "when a rocket fired by terrorists from Gaza is about to hit their home." When it was proved the photo was from 2009 he said, "I never stated that the photo was current. It illustrates the fear that people in southern Israel live in."&lt;ref name="hadid"&gt;Diaa Hadid, [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1A1-1f40d5c71d714838a2ee4223ba3b6bcb.html Old photos tweeted in Israel-Palestinian conflict], [[Associated Press]] Worldstream, via [[Highbeam]], March 15, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In early November 2012, Israeli activists reported that several journalists with cameras followed a Palestinian girl as she repeatedly tried without success to provoke a violent reaction from Israeli soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4303199,00.html Childish Weapon], Ynet November 16, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; On November 18, Alarab Net, an Arab news site, released a photo of three bloodied children and their mother with the caption "martyred massacred family in Gaza".

==Peace projects==
[[File:GalilSchoolSign.jpg|thumb|175px|left|The sign outside [[Galil Jewish-Arab School]].]]
Many [[Arab–Israeli peace projects]] actively involve children and teenagers. For example, [[Seeds of Peace]] was founded in 1993 with the goal of creating new generations of leaders in conflict regions that will no longer accept outdated and harmful stereotypes about each other. This would occur by bringing together youth from both sides of conflict regions to literally put a human face on those who were previously perceived as an enemy. The organization, which began with Israeli, Palestinian, and Egyptian teenagers, has expanded to reach [[Jordan]], [[Morocco]], [[Qatar]], [[Tunisia]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Yemen]], [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Maine]], [[Cyprus]] ([[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]]/[[Republic of Cyprus]]), and the [[Balkans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seedsofpeace.org/programs |title=List of Current Seeds of Peace Areas of Operation |accessdate=November 11, 2012 |publisher=Seeds of Peace}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Children of Peace]], a charity based in the United Kingdom, is self-described as focused "upon building alliances with like-minded organisations in the Gaza, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon and the West Bank [establishing] projects and programmes in the arts, education, health and sports for Israeli and Palestinian children, aged 4 – 17."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.childrenofpeace.org.uk/whatwedo.html |title=WHAT WE DO|author=Robin Jones|date=March 20, 2015|publisher=|accessdate=April 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Martin, who founded the organization in 2005, has stated that he refuses to take sides because "all children suffer in conflict."&lt;ref&gt;Vosper, Nicole and Walkden, Ruth (March 11, 2011).

[[File:Twoteachers.jpg|thumb|Two Hand in Hand teachers]]
Middle East Education Through Technology (MEET), the Institute for Circlework, TEC-the Center for Teachnologystrives, and [[Hand in Hand: Center for Jewish Arab Education in Israel|Hand in Hand]] focus on educational efforts. Hand in Hand is a network of bilingual (Hebrew-Arabic) schools in which Jewish and Arab children study together. It was founded in 1997 by two Israelis, one Arab and one Jewish, with the philosophy of breaking negative stereotypes, cultivating mutual respect and understanding, and providing a dynamic example that Jews and Arabs can study, work and live together in peace.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iie.org/Content/NavigationMenu/Programs7/Goldberg_Prize/Goldberg_Prize_2007_Press_Release.htm  "IIE AWARDS PRIZE TO FOUNDERS OF BILINGUAL AND MULTICULTURAL SCHOOLS"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012200139/http://iie.org/Content/NavigationMenu/Programs7/Goldberg_Prize/Goldberg_Prize_2007_Press_Release.htm |date=October 12, 2007 }}, International Institute of Education, Press Release, June 14, 2007.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hand in Hand has also hosted basketball games organized by PeacePlayers International (PPI) between Israeli and Palestinian teenagers, describing them as "baby steps" towards peace. Ala Khatib, a co-principal, said that "Never mind what is going on outside, whether it's bombing in Gaza or if it's suicide bombing in Tel Aviv, you can't stop school. You have to go to school, you have to face the other side, you have to say good morning, and you have to talk."&lt;ref&gt;Arie, Roni (November 18, 2008).

Retrieved January 26, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the United States-based Kabbalah Center and the Palestinian Abu Assukar Center for Peace and Dialogue organized a children's camp for 115 Israeli children and 115 Palestinian children aged 8 to 12 to take place near Tel Aviv at the Ramat Gan Safari Park. The camp, which lasted for four days, involved children from Bethlehem, Ramallah, East Jerusalem, Tulkarem, Jericho, and Jenin. The Israeli children involved were mostly those who came from severe poverty and violent backgrounds. Joint-organizer Osnat Youdkevitch remarked that, "Our message is that of dignity for all human beings. It's harder for adults to fully understand, since so much has already been built up around us, but kids have the chance to grow up thinking in a healthier way. If you play, eat and sweat for four days with a group of other kids who are supposed to be the 'enemy', it will stay in your heart forever."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Amelia (September 2, 2005).

Mifalot is an organization founded by the owners of Hapoel Tel Aviv Football Club to promote peaceful coexistence through football. In 2013, a football match was held in [[Holon]], bringing together Palestinian and Israeli teenagers. However, Fatah activists posted threatening messages on the Internet against the Palestinian boys and girls who participated in the tournament, and Fatah leaders in Ramallah condemned their participation in such events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/National-News/Friendly-soccer-match-leads-to-Fatah-threats-313240|title=Friendly soccer match leads to Fatah threats|work=The Jerusalem Post |accessdate=April 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cold Fire''' was a [[wildfire]] that started on August 2, 2016 in the [[Vaca Mountains]], near [[Lake Berryessa]] and just west of the city of [[Winters, California|Winters]], in [[Yolo County, California|Yolo County]], northern California. The fire was contained by 6 PM on August 11 after burning a total of {{convert|5,371|acres|km2}}, including two buildings, causing an estimated $100,000 in damage.&lt;ref name="NVR1"/&gt;

==Events==

According to contemporary theories of consciousness, the brain is the basis of [[subjectivity|subjective experience]], [[agency (philosophy)|agency]], [[self-awareness]], and [[awareness]] of the surrounding [[nature|natural world]]. When [[brain death]] occurs, all [[brain activity|brain function]] permanently ceases. Many people who believe that death is a permanent cessation of consciousness also believe that consciousness is dependent upon the functioning of the brain. Scientific research has discovered that some areas of the brain, like the [[reticular activating system]] or the [[thalamus]], appear to be [[necessity and sufficiency|necessary]] for consciousness, because [[disorders of consciousness|damage to these structures]] or their lack of function causes a loss of consciousness.

Through a naturalist analysis of the [[mind]] (an approach adopted by many philosophers of mind and neuroscientists), it is regarded as being dependent on the brain, as shown from the various effects of brain damage.&lt;ref name="Neuroscience and the soul"&gt;{{cite web

== Etymology ==
The English word "oblivion" (late 14c.) comes from the [[Old French]] ''oblivion'' (13c.) and directly from the [[Latin]] ''oblivionem'', meaning "forgetfulness; a being forgotten", which also comes from the word ''oblivisci'' ("to forget").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=oblivion|title=oblivion - Origin and meaning of oblivion by Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com|accessdate=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[:wikt:oblivion|Oblivion]] itself means "state of being forgotten".

==Oblivion and subjectivity==
Thomas W. Clark, founder of Center for Naturalism, wrote a paper titled "Death, Nothingness, and Subjectivity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.naturalism.org/death.htm |title=death |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140208055953/http://www.naturalism.org/death.htm |website=www.naturalism.org |archivedate=2014-02-08 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; He critiqued what he saw as a flawed description of eternal oblivion as a "plunge into darkness". When some imagine their deaths (including the non-religious), they project themselves into a future [[self]] which experiences an eternal silent darkness. This is wrong, because without consciousness, there is no awareness of [[space]] and no basis for [[time]]. For Clark, in oblivion there isn't even an absence of experience, as we can only speak of experience when a subjective self exists.

According to [[neuroscience|neuroscientist]] [[Giulio Tononi]], consciousness is "all we are and all we have: lose consciousness and, as far as you are concerned, your own self and the entire world dissolve into nothingness."&lt;ref name="pmid19098144"&gt;{{cite journal

==Neuroscience==
[[Steven Pinker]] explains the following in the seminar Is Science Killing the Soul, a discussion with [[Richard Dawkins]] presenting evidence against the existence of [[soul]]s. He elaborates;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.edge.org/conversation/richard_dawkins-steven_pinker-is-science-killing-the-soul|title=Is science killing the soul?|date=4 July 1999|first=John|last=Brockman|website=Edge|accessdate=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: "Many kinds of evidence show that the mind is an entity in the physical world, part of a causal chain of physical events. If you send an electric current through the brain, you cause the person to have a vivid experience. If a part of the brain dies because of a blood clot or a burst artery or a bullet wound, a part of the person is gone — the person may lose an ability to see, think, or feel in a certain way, and the entire personality may change. The same thing happens gradually when the brain accumulates a protein called beta-amyloid in the tragic disease known as [[Alzheimer's]]. The person — the soul, if you want — gradually disappears as the brain decays from this physical process. We know that every form of mental activity — every emotion, every thought, every percept — gives off electrical, magnetic, or metabolic signals that can be recorded with increasing precision by [[positron emission tomography]], [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]], [[magnetoencephalography]], and other techniques. We know that if you look at the brain under a microscope, it has a breathtaking degree of complexity — on the order of a trillion synapses — that's fully commensurate with the breathtaking complexity of human thought and experience. We know that when the brain dies, the person goes out of existence."

==Physics and death==
In his book ''The Big Picture'', physicist [[Sean M. Carroll|Sean Carroll]] asserts that through physics we can demonstrate that death is equivalent to eternal oblivion. He writes;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Carroll |first=Sean M. |title=The Big Picture: On the Origins of Life, Meaning, and the Universe Itself |year=2016 |publisher=Penguin |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x21qCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA218 |isbn=9780698409767 |p=218}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: "There is a much more profound implication of accepting the Core Theory as underlying the world of our everyday experience. Namely: there is no life after death. We each have a finite time as living creatures, and when it's over, it's over. The reasoning behind such a sweeping claim is even more straightforward than the argument against [[telekinesis]] or [[astrology]]. If the particles and forces of the Core Theory are what constitute each living being, without any immaterial soul, then the information that makes up "you" is contained in the arrangement of atoms that makes up your body, including your brain. There is no place for that information to go, or any way for it to be preserved, outside your body. There are no particles or fields that could store it and take it away."

== In philosophy ==
{{primary sources|section|date=August 2017}}
In the ''[[Apology (Plato)|Apology of Socrates]]'' (written by [[Plato]]), after [[Socrates]] is sentenced to death, he addresses the court. He ponders the nature of death, and summarizes that there are basically two opinions about it. The first is that it is a [[Metempsychosis|migration of the soul]] or [[consciousness]] from this existence into another, and that the souls of all previously deceased people will also be there. This excites Socrates, because he will be able to conduct his [[Socratic method|dialectic inquiries]] with all of the great [[Greek hero cult|Greek heroes]] and thinkers of the past. The other opinion about death is that it is oblivion, the complete cessation of consciousness, not only unable to feel but a complete lack of awareness, like a person in a deep, dreamless sleep. Socrates says that even this oblivion does not frighten him very much, because while he would be unaware, he would correspondingly be free from any pain or suffering. Indeed, Socrates says, not even the great King of Persia could say that he ever rested so soundly and peacefully as he did in a dreamless sleep.

[[Cicero]], writing three centuries later in his treatise ''[[Cato Maior de Senectute|On Old Age]]'', in the voice of [[Cato the Elder]], similarly discussed the prospects of death, frequently referring to the works of earlier Greek writers. Cicero also concluded that death was either a continuation of consciousness or cessation of it, and that if consciousness continues in some form, there is no reason to fear death; while if it is in fact eternal oblivion, he will be free of all worldly miseries, in which case he should also not be deeply troubled by death.

Similar thoughts about death were expressed by the [[Roman Republic|Roman]] [[poet]] and [[Philosophy|philosopher]] [[Lucretius]] in his first-century BC [[Didacticism|didactic]] poem ''[[De rerum natura]]'' and by the ancient [[Greek philosophy|Greek philosopher]] [[Epicurus]] in his ''Letter to Menoeceus'', in which he writes;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epicurus.net/en/menoeceus.html|title=Epicurus - Letter to Menoeceus|first=Vincent|last=Cook|website=www.epicurus.net|accessdate=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.gsu.edu/~phltso/deathfrags.html|title=Epicurus and Lucretius against the dear of death|website=www2.gsu.edu|accessdate=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: "Accustom yourself to believing that death is nothing to us, for good and evil imply the capacity for sensation, and death is the privation of all sentience; therefore, a correct understanding that death is nothing to us makes the mortality of life enjoyable, not by adding to life a limitless time, but by taking away the yearning after immortality. For life has no terrors for him who has thoroughly understood that there are no terrors for him in ceasing to live. Foolish, therefore, is the man who says that he fears death, not because it will pain when it comes, but because it pains in the prospect. Whatever causes no annoyance when it is present causes only a groundless pain in the expectation. Death, therefore, the most awful of evils, is nothing to us, seeing that, when we are, death is not come, and when death is come, we are not. It is nothing, then, either to the living or to the dead, for with the living it is not and the dead exist no longer."

Paraphrasing philosopher [[Paul Edwards (philosopher)|Paul Edwards]], Keith Augustine and Yonatan I. Fishman note that "the greater the damage to the brain, the greater the corresponding damage to the mind. The natural extrapolation from this pattern is all too clear — obliterate brain functioning altogether, and mental functioning too will cease".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dlRuBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA206 books.google.com], Augustine &amp; Fishman, 2015, p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt;

__NOTOC__
{{Redirect|EUDC|end-user defined characters in the Microsoft Windows environment|TrueType#File_formats}}
The '''European Universities Debating Championship''' ('''EUDC''') is an annual [[debate|debating]] tournament for teams from [[university|universities]] in [[Europe]]. The competition uses the [[British Parliamentary Style|British Parliamentary Debate]] format (the same debate format used at the [[World Universities Debating Championship]]).

The championships as they are known today were first held in [[Rotterdam]], [[Netherlands]] at [[Erasmus University]] from 8–11 April 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.viennaeudc.eu/abouteudc/|title=The European University Debating Championships (EUDC) - Vienna EUDC 2015|work=Vienna EUDC 2015|access-date=2018-04-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent tournaments were held at a similar time of year until Koc EUDC in 2007 when the tournament shifted to the late summer in order to accommodate all university examination periods across the continent. The competition has also become longer to accommodate the growth of the event.

The competition in 1999 involved 32 teams of two speakers, but has now grown to involve up to 200 teams each year. Institutions can enter more than one team based on the ability of the organisers to accommodate them. Some institutions also enter teams from more than one separate debating societies within their institution.

Participating teams are drawn principally from European [[tertiary education]] institutions, although teams from the [[Middle East]] and central [[Asia]]n institutions are eligible pending the formation of similar competitions in their regions. Students at the [[Inns of Court]] are also eligible subject to some conditions.

== Current Champions==

The current European Champions in the Open category are Noam Dahan and Tom Manor from [[Tel Aviv University]], Israel.

The 'English as a Second Language' category was won by Ido Kotler and Amichay Even Chen from [[Tel Aviv University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.achteminute.de/en/20180808/eudc-2018-results-tel-aviv-win-both-finals/|title=EUDC 2018 Results: Tel Aviv win both finals|date=2018-08-08|work=Achte Minute|access-date=2018-08-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== EUDC Council and EUDC Committee ==

In 1999, the EUDC Council was formed as the highest decision making organ. Every competing nation has one vote. The council sits during the tournament.  It decides on the constitution, criteria regarding eligibility issues, and about the hosts of future championships.

The EUDC Committee consist of a president, who also chairs the council, a secretary, a registrar, the hosts of the current tournament and the past tournament and regional representatives for central and eastern Europe, for Northern and Western Europe, South-East Europe, the middle east and the Islands of the North Atlantic.

Minutes of EUDC Council and the Constitution are published on the EUDC Council Website&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eudc.wikidot.com/documents|title=Constitution and Minutes - EUDC Council|website=eudc.wikidot.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current chair of council and president of the committee is Jan-Gunther Gosselke from the [[Debattierclub St Gallen]] from [[Switzerland]].

The '''Exploits Valley Salmon Festival''' is an annual festival held in [[Grand Falls-Windsor]] of the [[Exploits Valley]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], [[Canada]] that dates back to 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=[[The Telegram]]|author=Corrina Baggs|title=A river runs through it|date=July 10, 2009|url=http://www.thetelegram.com/Food/2009-07-10/article-1440484/A-river-runs-through-it/1|accessdate=December 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Events that are part of the festival include a dance in a stadium and a dinner of [[salmon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=[[The Telegram]]|title=Remaining events for salmon festival announced|date=June 24, 2010|url=http://www.thetelegram.com/Festivals-events/2010-06-24/article-1451652/Remaining-events-for-salmon-festival-announced/1|accessdate=December 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a concert, although the concert in 2007 was so poorly attended that the organisers lost $200,000 on it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=The Advertiser|author=Wendy Houlihan|title=Festival success stands test of time|date=December 13, 2007|url=http://www.gfwadvertiser.ca/Editorial-opinion/2007-12-13/article-1407132/Festival-success-stands-test-of-time/1|accessdate=December 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organisers continued to lose money on the festival in 2008, 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=The Advertiser|author=Sue Hickey|title=More than the money|date=November 23, 2009|url=http://www.gfwadvertiser.ca/Editorial-opinion/2009-11-23/article-1405149/More-than-the-money/1|accessdate=December 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=The Advertiser|author=Krysta Carroll|title='It is still a deficit'|date=October 4, 2010|url=http://www.gfwadvertiser.ca/News/2010-10-04/article-1818785/It-is-still-a-deficit/2|accessdate=December 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Businessman Boyd Cohen was the [[Patronage|patron]] of the 2009 festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=The Advertiser|author=Corrina Baggs|title=Local business icon named festival patron|date=July 16, 2009|url=http://www.gfwadvertiser.ca/News/2009-07-16/article-1405772/Local-business-icon-named-festival-patron/1|accessdate=December 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main festival concert in 2010 featured Matthew Hornell and the Diamond Minds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=The Advertiser|author=Krysta Carroll|title=Hitting the big stage|date=July 15, 2010|url=http://www.gfwadvertiser.ca/News/2010-07-15/article-1568691/Hitting-the-big-stage/1|accessdate=December 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also a [[Gospel music|gospel]] concert that was attended by hundreds of people.

As a result, the festival experienced a resurgence attracting larger crowds, The shows were headlined by popular groups such as [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], [[Smash Mouth]] and [[Down with Webster]] in 2011, [[Aerosmith]] &amp; [[Flo Rida]] in 2012, [[The Eagles]] and [[The Tragically Hip]] in 2013, [[Maroon 5]] in 2014 and [[John Fogerty]], [[Tom Cochrane]], [[America (band)|America]] and [[The Fables]] (making their first public performance in 12 years) in 2015.

The 2013 concert headlined by The Eagles was panned by critics for the poor planning. The temperature rose to approximately 30 degrees Celsius and many concert goers complained in regards to lack of available water as patrons were not permitted to bring their own. (concession stands reportedly ran out twice). according to reports more than 100 people had to be treated for dehydration. VIP ticket holders complained too many tickets were sold for the private section on the field and made the concert unenjoyable. Such complainants had told media outlets they were considering a class action lawsuit but it never materialized.

The 2014 concert achieved controversy during the planning stages. The town frequently delayed making an official announcement in regards to who would headline the show. Mayor Al Hawkins appeared on local radio commenting that the date would not be changed from a planned July 9th date. But despite this only a week later the concert was officially announced to take place on July 16th and would be headlined by Maroon 5. Many complained about the date change and were unimpressed with the lineup, expecting a more "legendary" act as in the past 3 years and cited lack of variety of types of music. as a result attendance was only 8,500 (less than 1/3 of the previous year) and the town reported a near $500,000 loss. the town denied any belief the date change lead to a low turnout instead blaming it on the media backlash from the previous year. 

In 2015, The town opted to buy out of their contract with RFO in response to the previous year's disappointment. The salmon festival success was threatened however, when the city of St. John's announced the date of their Confederation concert headlined by the legendary [[Rod Stewart]] would take place on the same date as the salmon festival concert. The own attempted to compete by announcing the salmon festival would headlined by [[John Fogerty]] and would feature [[Tom Cochrane]], [[America (band)|America]] and The Fables. Also, organizers allowed patrons to leave the grounds and return later (via a bracelet system) until 7pm. Despite rave reviews the concert was attended by only 5,500 people and a $667,000 loss. Later reports revealed promoters had advised the town to cancel the concert beforehand due to early tickets sales being poor but the decision to go ahead was narrowly passed by town council. reports also said John Fogerty had been paid $655,000 to perform at the show while Tom Cochrane and The Fables were paid a meager (by comparison) $52,000 and $10,000 respectively. 

The over $1 million in losses collectively over the previous 2 years lead to questions over the future of the yearly event. however, council announced the 2016 concert would go ahead but that it would be the end of the "mega concert". They would later announce a lineup consisting of headliner [[Trooper (band)|Trooper]] as well as [[The Stampeders]] and Newfoundland favorite [[Buddy Wasisname and the Other Fellers]]. the rest of the lineup consisting of local bands.

The body of '''Faith Hedgepeth''' (born September 26, 1992), an undergraduate student in her third year at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] (UNCCH), was found in her apartment by a friend on the morning of September 7, 2012. She had been beaten over the head with a blunt instrument, later found to be an empty liquor bottle, and very likely raped. The last time she was known for certain to be alive was much earlier that morning, when she went to bed after returning from a local nightclub with her roommate.&lt;ref name="ABC News story"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lopez|first1=Ed|last2=Valiente|first2=Alexa|title=Murdered UNC Student's Final Moments: What Police Say Happened to Faith Hedgepeth|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/murdered-unc-students-final-moments-police-happened-faith/story?id=42281581|newspaper=[[ABC News]]|date=September 22, 2016|accessdate=September 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Police have recovered considerable [[forensic evidence]] in the case, but so far it has served to eliminate one likely suspect, a former boyfriend of her roommate who reportedly expressed anger and resentment toward Hedgepeth, even supposedly threatening to kill her if he could not reunite with her roommate. His [[DNA]], however, did not match that left at the scene. A note left at the scene, suggesting the writer was jealous, is also believed to have been written by the killer; it was among a large group of documents released by police two years after the crime, following a court action brought by several local media outlets.&lt;ref name="WRAL documents release story"&gt;{{cite news|title=Newly released docs detail police's case in UNC student's murder|url=http://www.wral.com/newly-released-docs-detail-police-s-case-in-unc-student-s-murder/13954237/|newspaper=[[WRAL-TV]]|date=September 26, 2016|accessdate=September 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four years after the killing, a Virginia DNA testing company prepared and released, at police's behest, an image showing what the suspect might look like based on his genetic [[phenotype]].&lt;ref name="DNA phenotyping story"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fuerte|first1=Stephanie|last2=Valiente|first2=Alexa|title=Police Release Facial Image They Say Could Help Identify Murdered UNC Student's Killer|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/police-release-facial-image-identify-murdered-unc-students/story?id=42312443|newspaper=[[ABC News]]|date=September 23, 2016|accessdate=September 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A voicemail possibly accidentally recorded by Hedgepeth may also capture some of the events that led to her death. The [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina|Chapel Hill]] police continue to investigate.

==Background==

A member of the [[Haliwa-Saponi]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American tribe]] recognized by the state of [[North Carolina]], Faith Hedgepeth was born in 1992 in [[Warren County, North Carolina|Warren County]], part of the tribe's traditional territory. Her parents divorced within a year of her birth, and she was raised by her mother, with help from an older sister, in [[Hollister, North Carolina|Hollister]] and [[Warrenton, North Carolina|Warrenton]]. Connie Hedgepeth named her third daughter [[Faith (name)|Faith]] because she believed that was what she needed to raise a fourth child when she already had two sons and a daughter and a husband with a drug problem.&lt;ref name="Indian Country three-year anniversary story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Landry|first=Alyssa|title=Three Years Later: Still No Answers for Murdered Native Student’s Family|url=https://indiancountrymedianetwork.com/news/native-news/three-years-later-still-no-answers-for-murdered-native-students-family/|newspaper=[[Indian Country Media Network]]|date=September 9, 2015|accessdate=September 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In high school, Hedgepeth was an honor student, a cheerleader and a member of many extracurricular clubs and organizations. She did well enough academically to earn a [[Gates Millennium Scholars|Gates Millennium Scholarship]] to attend the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]]. Her father had attended UNCCH as well, but dropped out; she hoped to be the first in her family to graduate from college. After that, she was considering further studies to become either a [[pediatrics|pediatrician]] or teacher.&lt;ref name="Indian Country three-year anniversary story" /&gt;

Her first two years at the university went well for her; although she took the spring 2012 semester off.&lt;ref name="Daily Tarheel timeline story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Dulaney|first=Chelsea|title=On the last night of her life, an uncertain timeline for Faith Danielle Hedgepeth|url=http://www.dailytarheel.com/article/2012/10/on-last-night-an-uncertain-timeline|newspaper=[[The Daily Tar Heel]]|date=October 25, 2012|accessdate=September 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She remained in the [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina|Chapel Hill]] area over the summer, living in an off-campus apartment at the Hawthorne at the View complex between Chapel Hill and [[Durham, North Carolina|Durham]], on the line between [[Durham County, North Carolina|Durham]] and [[Orange County, North Carolina|Orange]] counties, during the month of August; she planned to move to another apartment after her [[Student financial aid (United States)|financial aid]] for the fall semester was made available to her. She shared the apartment with Karena Rosario, whom she had been friends with since freshman year,&lt;ref name="Daily Tarheel timeline story" /&gt; and Rosario's boyfriend, Eriq Takoy Jones.&lt;ref name="N&amp;O documents release story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Blythe|first=Anne|title=Court documents unsealed in search for Faith Hedgepeth's killer|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/crime/article10051073.html|newspaper=[[The News &amp; Observer]]|date=September 5, 2014|accessdate=September 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship between Jones and Rosario had been marked by [[domestic violence]], and eventually she ended it and he moved out. However, he had in early July 2012 twice attempted to break into the apartment, even after Rosario changed the locks. Hedgepeth drove her roommate to court to get a [[Injunction|protective order]] that required Jones to stay away from the apartment.&lt;ref name="Daily Tarheel timeline story" /&gt; Jones reportedly resented Hedgepeth's influence over his former girlfriend, and at one point reportedly threatened during a phone conversation with Hedgepeth to kill her if he could not get back together with Rosario.&lt;ref name="N&amp;O documents release story" /&gt;

==Homicide==

The evening of September 6, 2012, a Thursday, began at 5:45 p.m. with Hedgepeth attending a rush event for the campus chapter of [[Alpha Pi Omega]], a historically Native American [[sorority]] she hoped to join. At 7:15 she left, saying she had to work on a paper she was writing about the history of her tribe. She and Rosario went to the university's [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill#Libraries|Davis Library]] to study together at 8 p.m. Between 8:30 and 9 she exchanged texts with her father about her hopes to join the sorority.&lt;ref name="Daily Tarheel timeline story" /&gt; 

Hedgepeth left Rosario there briefly and returned around 11:30, after which they returned to their apartment together, arriving there around midnight. A half-hour later they left again, heading for Thrill, a nightclub in downtown Chapel Hill which admitted customers under the legal drinking age of 21 to dance. The two young women arrived at Thrill around 12:40 a.m. After almost an hour and a half of dancing, Rosario told police later that she was having an upset stomach and wanted to leave. [[Security camera]]s at the club show she and Hedgepeth leaving at 2:06 a.m.; it is the last visual record of her presence anywhere before the killing.&lt;ref name="ABC News story" /&gt;

By 3 a.m. Hedgepeth and Rosario had returned to their apartment. A woman who lived below the two and was awake watching television said that she heard three thumping noises, which she described as similar to a heavy bag being dropped or furniture being overturned, shortly afterward. Hedgepeth's [[Facebook]] page was also accessed around the same time.&lt;ref name="ABC News story" /&gt;

At 3:40 a.m., a text was sent from Hedgepeth's phone to that of Brandon Edwards, a former boyfriend of hers, saying "Hey b. Can you come over here please. Rosario needs you more aha. You know. Please let her know you care." Three minutes later, another text was sent from Hedgepeth's phone to Edwards' with the single word "than", believed to be a correction for the "aha" in the previous text. That was the last evidence of activity from her phone; at 4:16 Edwards sent a return text asking who the previous text was from.&lt;ref name="N&amp;O documents release story" /&gt;

Rosario's phone records show she was also trying to call Edwards around the same time. He did not answer, and when he did not she tried to call [[Jordan McCrary]], a [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's soccer|UNCCH soccer player]] she knew. At 4:25 a.m., she left the apartment to get in McCrary's car. At that time, Rosario said later, she believed Hedgepeth was asleep in her room, and left the apartment's door unlocked.&lt;ref name="ABC News story" /&gt;

McCrary drove Rosario to the home of another acquaintance on West Longview Street in Chapel Hill. She put the time of her arrival there at around 4:30 a.m. After spending the rest of the night and the early morning there, a short time after 10:30 she began trying to arrange a ride home. After attempting to reach Hedgepeth, who did not answer, Rosario instead called another friend, Marisol Rangel, who came and took her back to her apartment.&lt;ref name="ABC News story" /&gt;

When they arrived there, shortly before 11 a.m., they entered and called for Hedgepeth, who did not respond. In her bedroom, they found her bloodied body, wrapped in a quilt, partially nude. They immediately dialed [[9-1-1]] and informed police.&lt;ref name="ABC News story" /&gt;

==Investigation==

Details of the investigation were not discussed publicly at first, a deviation from the Chapel Hill police's usual practice;&lt;ref name="Dulaney Atavist piece"&gt;{{cite news|last=Dulaney|first=Chelsea|title=In the Shadow of the Sealings|url=https://synapse.atavist.com/sealings|newspaper=[[Atavist]]|date=April 2014|accessdate=September 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the town obtained a court order sealing all records as they were collected.&lt;ref name="Daily Tarheel timeline story" /&gt; Police collected [[semen]] from the scene and used it to develop a DNA profile; it reportedly was consistent with male DNA found elsewhere in the apartment. The autopsy determined that Hedgepeth had died from [[blunt force trauma]] to the head, likely a result of being hit by an empty rum bottle in the apartment.&lt;ref name="ABC News story" /&gt;

Jones seemed to be a very strong suspect from the beginning. Police learned of his history of domestic violence and his threat against Hedgepeth. They also found that the night before, around 6 p.m., he had texted an acquaintance asking for forgiveness "for what I am about to do" and then posted the same message on his [[Twitter]] feed. Three days later, he changed the banner on his [[Facebook]] page to read "Dear Lord, Forgive me for all of my sins and the sins I may commit today. Protect me from the girls who don't deserve me and the ones who wish me dead today."&lt;ref name="N&amp;O documents release story" /&gt;

Police sought a DNA sample from Jones, who they considered a [[person of interest]]; after some initial resistance, he complied. It did not match the one from the apartment, and they excluded him as a suspect. DNA from Edwards and many other men who police found had been at Thrill during the same time as Rosario and Hedgepeth was also tested, with the same result.&lt;ref name="Crime Watch Daily"&gt;{{cite news|title=Crime Watch Daily investigates the murder of Faith Hedgepeth|url=https://crimewatchdaily.com/2016/02/16/crime-watch-daily-investigates-the-murder-of-faith-hedgepeth/|newspaper=[[Crime Watch Daily]]|date=February 16, 2016|accessdate=September 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within days the university's board of trustees, the local [[Crime Stoppers]] chapter, the [[Haliwa-Saponi]] tribe and the apartment complex had offered a combined $29,000 in reward money for information leading to an arrest. Police hoped the reward money would lead to a quick resolution of the case, as their resources were limited. In the 2008 [[murder of Eve Carson]], at the time UNCCH's undergraduate student body president, a $25,000 reward had led to the killers' arrest.&lt;ref name="Daily Tarheel reward story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Dulaney|first=Chelsea|title=Trustees offer $25,000 in homicide case|url=http://www.dailytarheel.com/article/2012/09/trustees-offer-25000-in-homicide-case|newspaper=[[The Daily Tar Heel]]|date=September 12, 2012|accessdate=September 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two months later the office of [[Governor of North Carolina|governor]] [[Bev Perdue]] added another $10,000 to the reward for Hedgepeth's killer.&lt;ref name="Daily Tarheel governor's reward story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Dulaney|first=Chelsea|title=Reward raised for information in Hedgepeth slaying|url=http://www.dailytarheel.com/article/2012/11/reward-upped-in-student-slaying|newspaper=[[The Daily Tar Heel]]|date=November 14, 2012|accessdate=September 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Seal on case records===

In November, ''[[The Daily Tar Heel]]'', UNCCH's student newspaper, petitioned the judge who had ordered the investigation records sealed to release an early search warrant in the case. Instead the judge ordered it resealed for another 45 days. At that time the Chapel Hill police had not even released Hedgepeth's cause of death, although her parents told the media that their daughter's [[death certificate]] said she had been beaten.&lt;ref name="Daily Tarheel warrant reseal story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Dulaney|first=Chelsea|title=Still no answers in Hedgepeth killing|url=http://www.dailytarheel.com/article/2012/12/still-no-answers-in-hedgepeth-killing|newspaper=[[The Daily Tar Heel]]|date=December 5, 2012|accessdate=September 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Police announced in January that the DNA from the scene had come back as belonging to a male. From the crime scene and other evidence the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) had developed a [[Offender profiling|profile]] of the man. They said it was likely that he had lived near Hedgepeth in the past, had expressed an interest in her and his behavior may have changed since the crime, including showing an unusual interest in the case. Notwithstanding this release of information, the town successfully petitioned the court to keep the warrants under seal, saying that phase of the investigation was still not complete;&lt;ref name="Daily Tarheel profile story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Dulaney|first=Chelsea|title=Police profile male suspect in Hedgepeth homicide|url=http://www.dailytarheel.com/article/2013/01/50ececd570553|newspaper=[[The Daily Tar Heel]]|date=January 8, 2013|accessdate=September 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in May 2013 the court extended the seal another 60 days.&lt;ref name="Daily Tarheel May 2013 seal extension story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Greene|first=Taylor|title=Hedgepeth search warrants resealed by judge|url=http://www.dailytarheel.com/article/2013/05/hedgepeth-search-warrants-resealed-by-judge|newspaper=[[The Daily Tar Heel]]|date=May 22, 2013|accessdate=September 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2013, a year after the killing, Chapel Hill police formally requested the assistance of the [[North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation]], which had provided some help earlier in the investigation, with the case. "We're working the case hard, and we've used all the possible resources", said Chief Chris Blue. However, he would not share any more information about the case.&lt;ref name="Daily Tarheel SBI story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Surane|first=Jenny|title=Faith Hedgepeth case to get new SBI help|url=http://www.dailytarheel.com/article/2013/10/police-request-additional-assistance-in-hedgepeth-homicide|newspaper=[[The Daily Tar Heel]]|date=October 2, 2013|accessdate=September 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two months later, the ''Tar Heel'' noted that the Hedgepeth case remained open, along with the death of David Shannon, a UNCCH freshman whose body had been found on the grounds of a [[Carrboro, North Carolina|Carrboro]] cement plant the previous October 27 (while he had died from a fall, the autopsy found he was severely intoxicated, and the Carrboro police suspected [[Hazing in Greek letter organizations|hazing]] and believed there might be other students who could tell them more about the circumstances of Shannon's death). In Hedgepeth's case, there had been no new information about a possible suspect since January. Yet the case records remained under court-ordered seal.&lt;ref name="Daily Tarheel December 2013 story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Surane|first=Jenny|title=Faith Hedgepeth case to get new SBI help|url=http://www.dailytarheel.com/article/2013/12/yir-student-deaths|newspaper=[[The Daily Tar Heel]]|date=December 3, 2013|accessdate=September 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014 the ''Tar Heel'' was joined by the [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]] ''[[The News &amp; Observer|News &amp; Observer]]'' and [[Capitol Broadcasting Company]], which owns three television and radio stations in the [[Research Triangle]] area, in opposing the district attorney's motion to extend the seal another 60 days. They argued that the order was not justified by a [[compelling interest]] on the state's part, and that some of the orders had been issued before the records covered by them had been created, meaning the argument for sealing them was speculative.&lt;ref name="Daily Tarheel media companies story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Surane|first=Jenny|title=Faith Hedgepeth records to be reviewed on March 17|url=http://www.dailytarheel.com/article/2014/03/hedgepeth-records-to-be-reviewed-on-march-17|newspaper=[[The Daily Tar Heel]]|date=March 16, 2014|accessdate=September 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a hearing on the motion, the district attorney filed a more specific accounting of what investigative work had been done, allowing the media to report for the first time on what police had searched in the immediate aftermath of the crime. "Eighteen months goes by and no one's been charged and no one's been arrested" said a lawyer for the ''Tar Heel''. "The public has the right to assume the trail has gone cold, or it's not being investigated in a diligent manner." In response the district attorney's office argued that releasing the detailed records at that point would definitely hinder the investigation, and the records remained under seal.&lt;ref name="Daily Tarheel what was searched story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Surane|first=Jenny|title=Faith Hedgepeth records to stay sealed |url=http://www.dailytarheel.com/article/2014/03/faith-hedgepeth-records-to-stay-stealed|newspaper=[[The Daily Tar Heel]]|date=March 19, 2014|accessdate=September 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Criticism of seal====

The following month, Chelsea Dulaney, a reporter who had originally covered the case at the ''Tar Heel'', wrote an article on the ''[[Atavist]]'' platform taking a skeptical look at the sealing. She speculated that the seal's real purpose was to conceal early missteps by the Chapel Hill police, who might also not have been competent enough to handle the investigation all by themselves. The town's court filings, she noted, revealed that after the first two months of the investigation no new search warrants had been sought. "We have to ask, how hot is it?" asked one of the lawyers representing the media.&lt;ref name="Dulaney Atavist piece" /&gt;

Dulaney talked to the residents of the apartments at Hawthorne at the View who lived near Hedgepeth and Rosario. They told her that during the preceding summer, they strongly suspected the [[domestic violence]] later reported between Rosario and Jones; they thought the police presence on the day the body was found was related to that until they learned otherwise.&lt;ref name="Dulaney Atavist piece" /&gt;

Two of the neighbors told Dulaney that while the police sealed off the four-unit block where Hedgepeth and Rosario lived with [[Barricade tape|crime scene tape]], they only searched the women's apartment and not any of the others in it. Nor did they search the woods behind the apartments, and they only returned later to search one other apartment in the complex. They did not seem to [[canvassing|canvass]] the area, either, never knocking on doors and asking residents what they might have seen. The police also left Hedgepeth's car unsecured while they searched the apartments.&lt;ref name="Dulaney Atavist piece" /&gt;

When the [[North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation|State Bureau of Investigation]] officers began investigating the case late in 2013, they also interviewed residents of Hawthorne at the View. One resident who spoke to Dulaney said it was clear to her that the SBI investigators were better trained than their Chapel Hill counterparts had been. The agent who interviewed her asked questions that elicited more useful information from her, she recalled.&lt;ref name="Dulaney Atavist piece" /&gt;

In downtown Chapel Hill, Dulaney talked to the owner of a towing service who had the contract for the Thrill's parking lot. He had set up a system of [[security camera]]s to monitor activity in the club's parking lot that might have possibly recorded anything that happened outside of the club involving Hedgepeth and Rosario while they were there that morning, or after they left. The police did not ask to see it until shortly before Dulaney wrote the article, almost 19 months after the crime. By that time, he told her, any footage from that night had been long since recorded over.&lt;ref name="Dulaney Atavist piece" /&gt;

====Release of records====

The court ordered the records unsealed in July 2014. The media organizations were able to review and report on the search warrant applications and the investigative notes that had supported them, with most names [[Sanitization (classified information)|redacted]], for not only the residences and cars but Hedgepeth's phone, computer, Facebook records and bank account. Also released was the transcript of Rosario's 9-1-1 call, and the content of the early-morning text messages as well as the timeline of Rosario and Hedgepeth's actions the night before the body was found.&lt;ref name="N&amp;O documents release story" /&gt;

In September 2014, almost two years after Hedgepeth's death, the [[autopsy]] report was released. It confirmed what was on her death certificate, that she had died of blunt force trauma to the head. She had numerous cuts and bruises as well as blood under her fingernails, suggesting she had struggled with her killer. The DNA taken from the semen was matched to DNA elsewhere at the scene.&lt;ref name="N&amp;O documents release story" /&gt;

==Evidence==

The released records included the recording of Rosario's 9-1-1 call and two pieces of evidence that were seen as potentially helpful in narrowing down the killer's identity.&lt;ref name="N&amp;O documents release story" /&gt; The DNA profile was also used later to generate an image of the potential suspect.&lt;ref name="DNA phenotyping story" /&gt; "Investigators have excellent evidence in this case," Chief Blue said when the documents were released. "This is not a cold case. It has been and remains an active investigation."&lt;ref name="N&amp;O documents release story" /&gt;

===9-1-1 call===

''News &amp; Observer'' reporter Tom Gasparoli, who covered the case extensively for his newspaper, has also devoted most of his own [[blog]] to pondering the evidence and keeping the case alive. To him, Rosario's call raised many questions.&lt;ref name="Gaspo 9-1-1 call blog post"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gasparoli|first=Tom|title=The 911 Call Transcript is Here|url=http://www.gaspowrites.com/2014/07/the-911-call-transcript-is-here.html|newspaper=Gaspo Writes|date=July 7, 2014|accessdate=September 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; "To me, the whole call reeks of unusual," he wrote in 2017 on the case's fifth anniversary.&lt;ref name="Gaspo fifth anniversary blog post"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gasparoli|first=Tom|title=Five Years Ago, It Happened—New Info from Law Enforcement, Clip of Rosario 911 Call and Investigative Journey|url=http://www.gaspowrites.com/2017/09/new-info-from-law-enforcement-clip-of.html|newspaper=Gaspo Writes|date=September 6, 2017|accessdate=September 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gasparoli raised the possibility that Rosario's friend Marisol Rangel, whose voice sounds to him more like the constantly sobbing caller, was the real caller, only later identifying herself as Rosario after repeated requests from the dispatcher for her name. And if it was Rosario, she never mentions that Rangel accompanied her to the apartment. The caller also does not mention Hedgepeth's name in a call that lasts nearly eight minutes, only describing the body she has come upon as "her friend."&lt;ref name="Gaspo fifth anniversary blog post" /&gt;

And why, Gasparoli asked, does the caller seem reluctant to touch Hedgepeth's body despite repeated pleas from the dispatcher to at least see if she is still breathing? If Rosario was not able to bring herself to do so, could she not have asked Rangel to do so? "I have often thought," Gaparoli wrote,"[that] if it was [Rosario], that she didn't call 9-1-1 the moment she first saw [Hedgepeth]."&lt;ref name="Gaspo fifth anniversary blog post" /&gt;

===Note left at scene===
[[File:Hedgepeth note.jpeg|thumb|right|The note found near the body|alt=A wrinkled piece of white paper with the words "I'm not stupid bitch jealous" scrawled on them in ballpoint pen]]
Among the evidence collected was a note left near Hedgepeth's body with the text:
{{quote|&lt;center&gt;I'M NOT STUPID&lt;br&gt;BITCH&lt;br&gt;JEALOUS}}
It was sloppily written in ballpoint pen on what was determined to be the torn-off bottom of a white paper bag of the type commonly used for [[carry-out]] food. Police believe the bag may have come from Time-Out, a popular 24-hour restaurant in Chapel Hill that would have been the only place open&lt;ref name="Time-Out website"&gt;{{cite web|title=Time-Out Grill|url=http://timeout247.com/|accessdate=September 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the time Hedgepeth and Rosario left Thrill. It uses such bags and is a short distance away from the nightclub.&lt;ref name="ABC News story" /&gt;

Investigators have not said whether they have had the handwriting analyzed. The website ''[[Crime Watch Daily]]'' had an expert, Peggy Walla, look at photos of the note. She noted that it was clean of the blood reportedly found splattered all over the room, suggesting it was written either away from the crime scene or beforehand. The writer may have been using their non-dominant hand in an attempt to disguise their handwriting. Walla believes the writer was particularly agitated, likely to the point of homicidal rage, by being called "stupid".&lt;ref name="Crime Watch Daily" /&gt;

In his fifth-anniversary post, Gasparoli said a law enforcement source he talked to about the case refused to comment on whether the note was "odd" even as the source answered other questions. He elaborates that the words may have been intended to be read in a different order, producing wording that makes more sense ("I'm not jealous ... stupid bitch", for instance). In addition he theorizes that more than one writer may have been involved, or that not all of it may have been written at the same time.&lt;ref name="Gaspo fifth anniversary blog post" /&gt;

"Stupid", especially, looks to Gasparoli as if it might have been written separately from the other words, as it is written much more clearly and off to the side. The [[swash (typography)|swash]] extending leftward from the [[Counter (typography)|counter]] on the "P" in "STUPID", struck him as unusually distinctive. "[It] looks quite different, much more precise than any other letter in the note," he says. It seems to Gasparoli to suggest a female writer, or at least one calmer and more intelligent than the lettering elsewhere on the note.&lt;ref name="Gaspo fifth anniversary blog post" /&gt;

Gasparoli questioned in fact what purpose would be served by leaving it there. As a message to Hedgepeth it made no sense to leave it next to her body if she was dead; if it was written by the killer or killers it could have been particularly incriminating evidence and they had to be aware of that possibility. It looked to him, in fact, "[a]lmost as if it were a [[red herring]] ... left for some other reason than to reflect the real feelings of the killer(s). Left ... to confuse."&lt;ref name="Gaspo fifth anniversary blog post" /&gt;

===Conversation accidentally recorded===

A friend of Hedgepeth's shared with police a long conversation, perhaps inadvertently recorded, when Hedgepeth's phone [[Pocket dialing|pocket-dialed]] them on the night before the murder, that may have some bearing on the case. It consists of a three-way conversation, three minutes long, between what appears to be Hedgepeth and a male and female, with music in the background. It was [[timestamp]]ed at 1:23 a.m., when the timeline of that night has her at the Thrill.&lt;ref name="Crime Watch Daily" /&gt;

It was seen as mostly inaudible and of minimal evidentiary value until ''Crime Watch Daily'' hired audio expert [[Arlo West]], who specializes in enhancing such recordings. He claimed he heard Hedgepeth crying for help while the male says "I think she's dying" and the female says "Do it anyhow" after a long discussion in which the female seems to get angrier. The male and female use the name "Eric" and "Rosie" respectively.&lt;ref name="Crime Watch Daily" /&gt; Hedgepeth's father is convinced what was recorded was of his daughter's death; West agrees.&lt;ref name="Indian Country voicemail story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Landry|first=Alyssa|title=Chilling Voicemail in Hedgepeth Murder Case Made Public|url=https://indiancountrymedianetwork.com/news/native-news/chilling-voicemail-in-hedgepeth-murder-case-made-public/|newspaper=[[Indian Country Media Network]]|date=March 1, 2016|accessdate=September 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The website informed the Chapel Hill police of West's findings, and they agreed to consider West's enhanced version and evaluate it. However, due to the time of the message they do not believe it to be a recording of the killing; the music in the background further suggests it was recorded at Thrill.&lt;ref name="N&amp;O voicemail story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Schultz|first=Mark|title=Expert, police dispute voicemail in Faith Hedgepeth case|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/community/chapel-hill-news/article61107117.html|newspaper=[[The News &amp; Observer]]|date=February 20, 2016|accessdate=September 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several months later they added that the [[metadata]] associated with the call reinforces this belief.&lt;ref name="N&amp;O fourth anniversary story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gasparoli|first=Tom|title=Chapel Hill police say UNC student's murder not cold case|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/community/durham-news/dn-opinion/article95292287.html|newspaper=[[The News &amp; Observer]]|date=August 17, 2016|accessdate=September 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

West, for his part, cites a known software issue with phones like Hedgepeth's that resulted in inaccurate timestamps. He discounts the background sound as being music, since his analysis did not produce any sounds like percussion, a heavy bass or synthesizers. Further, he adds, there are none of the background sounds, like glasses clinking and others talking, that one would associate with a nightclub.&lt;ref name="N&amp;O voicemail story" /&gt;

===Image of suspect generated from DNA profile===

On a September 23, 2016, episode of the [[ABC News]] program ''[[20/20 (U.S. TV series)|20/20]]'', Chapel Hill police released an image generated by Parabon NanoLabs, a genetic testing company in [[Reston, Virginia]], of what the suspect who left the semen might look like based purely on the [[phenotype]] in his DNA profile.&lt;ref name="DNA phenotyping story" /&gt; Parabon's president told ABC that Snapshot, the program his company used to create the image, "predicts eye color, hair color, skin color, freckling, face morphology and ancestry." The image included a chart listing the probability that the suspect had the traits he was assigned.&lt;ref name="DNA phenotyping story" /&gt;

According to the image, the suspect was "very strongly Native American and European mixed ancestry or Latino". Most of his [[genetic marker]]s pointed to [[Mexican American|Mexican]], [[Colombian American|Colombian]] and [[Iberian peninsula|Iberian]] ancestry, with some other South American and African countries making up the balance. Parabon believed with over 80% confidence that the suspect would have a skin tone in the [[Olive skin|olive]] range, with very few freckles or none at all and black hair. It did not make any predictions as to his height and weight.&lt;ref name="DNA phenotyping story" /&gt;

==Theories==

Chapel Hill police have not named any suspects or even [[person of interest|persons of interest]] in the case, but have stated that they do not believe the killing was a mere [[crime of opportunity]] by a stranger, that instead it was committed by someone in her [[social group]], likely someone who knew her through UNCCH. They are certain the killer or killers knew Hedgepeth, and have interviewed 2,000 people, with DNA tests done on 750 of those. They have mapped the relations of many those interviewees with Hedgepeth and each other, and have reportedly narrowed a pool of a thousand possible suspects down to ten. "This is not a [[cold case]]. It's never been a cold case", Chief Blue told Gasparoli in 2016.&lt;ref name="N&amp;O fourth anniversary story" /&gt; 

A year later Gasparoli said that he believed that the killer was "just outside" Hedgepeth's closest friends and acquaintances. "Good chance this person didn't know [Hedgepeth] or investigators would know who it was," he wrote. They may, however, have been acting out of anger at some grievance she caused to someone closer to her.&lt;ref name="Gaspo fifth anniversary blog post" /&gt;

Blue declined to answer Gasparoli's question at that time as to whether investigators believed more than one person had been involved. "It's a piece of the puzzle we do not have if we connect the direct physical evidence," Celisa Lehew, who took over the case as the department's new chief investigator in 2016, told the reporter regarding that theory. "There was some knowledge that two people lived there."&lt;ref name="N&amp;O fourth anniversary story" /&gt;

Speculation has sometimes focused on Rosario, Hedgepeth's roommate at the time, due to her 9-1-1 call, the last texts sent from Hedgepeth's phone to her former boyfriend suggesting "[Rosario] needs you more than you know", the woman addressed as "Rosie" on the voicemail conversation and her decision to leave the apartment unlocked with, she claims, a sleeping Hedgepeth inside, to go sleep somewhere else at 4:30 the morning of the killing. Although she has left North Carolina and said very little about the case since then, Gasparoli wrote in 2017 that he learned from his police sources that they still regularly speak with her, and she cooperates. "They do believe there is more Rosario can tell them," he says. "[It] sounds to me like [Rosario] has been in the crosshairs ... as a key figure who knows more than she says she knows."&lt;ref name="Gaspo fifth anniversary blog post" /&gt;

The '''Four-State Tornado Swarm''' was a destructive outbreak of [[tornado]]es in [[New England]] on August 15, 1787. At least five separate tornadoes caused major damage in the states of [[Connecticut]], [[Rhode Island]], [[Massachusetts]], and [[New Hampshire]]. Two people were killed by a tornado in [[Wethersfield, Connecticut]], and many were injured throughout New England. This event is considered to be the first true [[tornado outbreak]] on record.&lt;ref name="Grazulis"&gt;Grazulis, pg. 553&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://wmo.asu.edu/tornado-largest-tornado-outbreak Tornado: Largest Tornado Outbreak] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130926235427/http://wmo.asu.edu/tornado-largest-tornado-outbreak |date=2013-09-26 }}.

==Synopsis==
[[File:Four-State Tornado Swarm.PNG|thumb|250px|A map of towns which reported damage. Not all of these damage areas were definitely [[tornado|tornadic]], and some tornadoes hit more than one town.&lt;ref name="Grazulis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ludlam 12"/&gt;]]
The first storm damage occurred in [[Litchfield, Connecticut]], where a strong northwest wind and [[hail]] stones weighing more than {{convert|1|oz|g}} damaged crops and broke windows. Four men were struck by lightning, but survived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Litchfield, August 20 | author = No Author | url = http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?index=18&amp;did=838184602&amp;SrchMode=1&amp;sid=4&amp;Fmt=10&amp;VInst=PROD&amp;VType=PQD&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=HNP&amp;TS=1245891146&amp;clientId=61720 | format = PDF | publisher = [[The Hartford Courant|The Connecticut Courant and Weekly Intelligencer]] | location = Hartford, Connecticut | date = August 27, 1787 | page = 3 | accessdate = June 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first tornado touched down near [[New Britain, Connecticut]], between 1 p.m. and 2 p.m., moving east-northeast. A barn roof was blown {{convert|2|mi|km}} away. The tornado then passed through [[Newington, Connecticut|Newington]] on its way to [[Wethersfield, Connecticut|Wethersfield]]. The tornado there was described as "[whirling] with amazing velocity and a most tremendous roar."&lt;ref name="Grazulis"/&gt; It passed through a mostly-uninhabited part of the town; if the path were more than {{convert|0.5|mi|km|sigfig=1}} further north or south, the tornado "would have been fatal to a large number of families."&lt;ref name="Wethersfield"&gt;{{cite news | title = An Account of the late hurricane at Wethersfield | author = J. Lewis | url = http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?index=0&amp;did=838184472&amp;SrchMode=2&amp;sid=3&amp;Fmt=10&amp;VInst=PROD&amp;VType=PQD&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=HNP&amp;TS=1244610276&amp;clientId=61720 | format = PDF | publisher = [[The Hartford Courant|Connecticut Courant and Weekly Intelligencer]] | location = Hartford, Connecticut | date = August 20, 2009 | page = 3 | accessdate = June 10, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The tornado traveled slightly north of east, and struck just one home. The inhabitants fled the house upon the sight of the tornado: two young boys, a laborer, and a mother and baby were overtaken by the tornado in a nearby field. The two boys were found amid some rubble, one dead and one was "feared mortally wounded." The mother was killed as well, but the baby who was in her arms survived with only minor injuries. The laborer was thrown over a fence but only slightly injured.&lt;ref name="Wethersfield"/&gt; Their house was unroofed, and several outbuildings were "leveled with the ground". Clothes from the house were found three miles away, and trees and boards were carried {{convert|0.5|mi|km|sigfig=1}} or more.&lt;ref name="Grazulis"/&gt;

The tornado continued east-northeast from Wethersfield, leveling almost all trees in its path, until it reached [[Glastonbury, Connecticut|Glastonbury]].&lt;ref name="Wethersfield"/&gt; There it damaged several homes and barns, including an unroofing of a large brick home, but only injured two people slightly. The damage continued into at least [[Bolton, Connecticut|Bolton]] and [[Coventry, Connecticut|Coventry]], where more damage was done, but any specific damage done or human casualties are unknown.&lt;ref name="Grazulis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wethersfield"/&gt;

The second tornado was spotted west of [[East Windsor, Connecticut|East Windsor]]. It moved northeast away from the center of town, but did damage to a home and a barn. Trees {{convert|2.5|ft|m}} in diameter were twisted down, and even sod and stones "of a considerable size" were torn up.&lt;ref name="Wethersfield"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ludlam 15"&gt;Ludlam, pg. 15&lt;/ref&gt; No injuries were reported, however.

The third tornado of the outbreak was a long-tracked tornado, first spotted in [[Killingly, Connecticut]]. It moved northeast into [[Rhode Island]] to near [[Glocester, Rhode Island|Glocester]]. Orchards were destroyed there, and a house and barn were "torn to pieces" while the family took shelter in the cellar.&lt;ref name="Glocester"&gt;{{cite news | title = Glocester, August 17, 1787 | author = No Author | url = http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?index=5&amp;did=837077472&amp;SrchMode=2&amp;sid=4&amp;Fmt=10&amp;VInst=PROD&amp;VType=PQD&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=HNP&amp;TS=1245889587&amp;clientId=61720 | format = PDF | publisher = The Connecticut Courant and Weekly Intelligencer | location = Hartford, Connecticut | date = September 3, 1787 | page = 2 | accessdate = June 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several other homes were unroofed, and a woman was carried some distance, but only suffered minor injuries.&lt;ref name="Glocester"/&gt; The tornado continued northeast into [[Massachusetts]] as far as [[Mendon, Massachusetts|Mendon]], {{convert|20|mi|km}} from where it touched down.&lt;ref name="Gloucester"&gt;{{cite news | title = Goucester, August 17, 1787 | author = No Author | url = http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?index=5&amp;did=837077472&amp;SrchMode=2&amp;sid=4&amp;Fmt=10&amp;VInst=PROD&amp;VType=PQD&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=HNP&amp;TS=1245889587&amp;clientId=61720 | format = PDF | publisher = The Connecticut Courant and Weekly Intelligencer | location = Hartford, Connecticut | date = September 3, 1787 | page = 2 | accessdate = June 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth known tornado was first spotted near [[Northborough, Massachusetts]]. The tornado caused more severe damage along the border between [[Marlborough, Massachusetts|Marlborough]] and [[Southborough, Massachusetts|Southborough]]. In Marlborough, a barn was thrown from its foundation. A house's roof was destroyed, with pieces scattered {{convert|0.75|mi|km|sigfig=2}} away. In Southborough and [[Framingham, Massachusetts|Framingham]], many structures were damaged. A house in Framingham was destroyed while two women were inside, but they suffered only bruises. The tornado dissipated east of Framingham.&lt;ref name="Ludlam 15"/&gt; Many crops were destroyed by winds and floods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Boston, August 20 | author = No Author | url = http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?index=20&amp;did=838184582&amp;SrchMode=1&amp;sid=2&amp;Fmt=10&amp;VInst=PROD&amp;VType=PQD&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=HNP&amp;TS=1245908777&amp;clientId=61720 | format = PDF | publisher = [[The Hartford Courant|Connecticut Courant and Weekly Intelligencer]] | location = Hartford, Connecticut | date = August 27, 1787 | page = 3 | accessdate = June 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Observers reported seeing pieces of buildings, furniture, and trees thrown about in the air. Severe tree damage was reported all along the tornado's path. Along the tornado's route, the damage was not more than {{convert|40|rd|ft m}} wide, and in some places was much narrower, though the damage was greatest in these areas.&lt;ref name="Ludlam 15"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ludlam 16"&gt;Ludlam, pg. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

The final tornado of the day occurred much further north in the town of [[Rochester, New Hampshire]]. A house was lifted from its foundation with eight people inside, but only two were injured. Pieces of the house were found {{convert|3|mi|km}} distant. A barn was "taken and entirely carried off" by the tornado, and was not found. Trees, fences, and crops were leveled along the tornado's path, which was around {{convert|20|rd|ft m}} wide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Portsmouth, August 18 | author = No Author | url = http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?index=19&amp;did=838184592&amp;SrchMode=1&amp;sid=4&amp;Fmt=10&amp;VInst=PROD&amp;VType=PQD&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=HNP&amp;TS=1245891146&amp;clientId=61720 | format = PDF | publisher = [[The Hartford Courant|The Connecticut Courant and Weekly Intelligencer]] | location = Hartford, Connecticut | date = August 27, 1787 | page = 3 | accessdate = June 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Considerable damage also occurred in [[Dunbarton, New Hampshire]] and [[Concord, New Hampshire]], but it is not known if this was not directly connected to the tornado.&lt;ref&gt;Perley, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical perspective==
This day was the most extensive tornado event on record at the time, and was the most severe tornado outbreak in early New England history, on par only with the [[September 1821 New England tornado outbreak]].&lt;ref name="Grazulis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ludlam 12"&gt;Ludlam, pg. 12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Great Tornado of 1821 In New Hampshire |last=Lamb |first=Fred W. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1908 |publisher= |location=Manchester, N.H. |isbn= |page= |pages= |id= |url=https://archive.org/details/greattornadoof1800lamb |accessdate=2009-08-15 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Very few buildings were struck by the tornadoes (though the tornadoes passed close to many highly populated towns) which accounts for the low death toll.&lt;ref name="Ludlam 12"/&gt; However, the destructive potential was high, as indicated by the incredible tree damage in places.&lt;ref name="Ludlam 13"&gt;Ludlam, pg. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

A document was published in the ''Connecticut Courant'' (now the ''[[Hartford Courant]]'') a few days later, detailing the appearance of "a black column from the earth to the cloud" near [[Wethersfield, Connecticut|Wethersfield]]. This was the most complete description of a tornado on record until the 1830s.&lt;ref name="Ludlam 12"/&gt;

The '''Great Escape Tour''' was the scheduled second headlining concert tour by Australian recording artist [[Iggy Azalea]] in support of her debut album, ''[[The New Classic]]'' (2014), its reissue, ''[[Reclassified]]'' (2014) and then-upcoming second studio album. The tour was scheduled to visit twenty-one cities across [[North America]] over the span of two months, beginning on 18 September 2015 in [[San Diego, California]] and concluding on 27 October 2015 in [[Glendale, Arizona]]. It was announced on 29 May 2015 that the entire tour was cancelled, with a new tour to be announced with her then-upcoming, later cancelled album in 2016.&lt;ref name="XXL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2015/05/iggy-azalea-cancels-tour/|title=Iggy Azalea Cancels Her Tour|work=[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]|date=29 May 2015|accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first of Azalea's tours to be cancelled, with her 2018 Bad Girls Tour also later cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/iggy-azalea-bad-girls-tour-canceled-1150078|title=Iggy Azalea Bad Girls Tour Canceled|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|last=Jaime|first=Natalya|date=7 October 2018|accessdate=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
On 10 December 2014, when reflecting on the year she has had and the struggles she faced in the years before, Azalea announced plans of an arena tour and a second studio album via her [[Twitter]] account. The same day, Azalea revealed the title of the tour and the concept behind it, which is Azalea picturing herself as "a musical escape artist for people." Azalea also revealed that the name of the tour goes along with the title of her upcoming second studio album, which will also be promoted on the tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bobb|first=Maurice|title=Iggy Azalea's Planning Her 'Great Escape': Here's What She's Talking About|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2023011/iggy-azalea-announces-great-escape-tour/|work=[[MTV]]|date=10 December 2014|accessdate=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 December 2014, the North American leg of the tour was officially announced. Presented by [[Anschutz Entertainment Group|AEG]], the first leg of tour, which was set to commence on 14 April 2015 in [[Fresno, California]], and was scheduled to visit twenty-four cities across North America during the spring of 2015 before ending on 24 May 2015 in [[Austin, Texas]]. Also revealed in the North American leg announcement was that [[Nick Jonas]] and [[Tinashe]] would be the special guests supporting Azalea on the first leg of the tour promoting their latest individual efforts, ''[[Nick Jonas (album)|Nick Jonas]]'' (2014) and ''[[Aquarius (Tinashe album)|Aquarius]]'' (2014). Azalea's [[disc jockey]], DJ Wizz Kidd, would also support Azalea throughout the tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bobb|first=Maurice|title=Iggy Azalea Announces The Great Escape Tour Dates: See Them Here!|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2027204/iggy-azalea-great-escape-tour-nick-jonas/|work=[[MTV]]|date=15 December 2014|accessdate=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning on 15 December 2014, pre-sale tickets were available to all [[American Express]] cardholders through 18 December 2014. The public on-sale followed immediately after with tickets becoming available on 19 December 2014. Platinum and VIP Packages also became available for purchase on AEG's website, in which the packages included premium seating and exclusive autographed merchandise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iggy Azalea Blazes a Trail For the Can’t-Miss The Great Escape Tour|url=http://www.aeglive.com/news/view/12284|work=[[Anschutz Entertainment Group]]|date=15 December 2014|accessdate=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with ''[[GQ]]'', Azalea began to reveal details about the tour's stage, visuals, and concept. When speaking about her main focus of the tour, Azalea stated "I want everything to be right—everything, from the tour book to what someone wears. Even the right faces for the dancers, and their attitude. Everything is equally important." While discussing stage layout, Azalea revealed that she's "trying to work on the initial stage design" and that she's "making a stage that [she can] engage with many people in an arena that big." She also noted that she was working with [[Jamie King]], who has also worked with [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] on her [[Confessions Tour]] (2006), which Azalea has stated is a major influence for the tour. Other influences for the tour that she's mentioned include the films ''[[Xanadu (film)|Xanadu]]'' (1980) and ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' (1940). In regards to the visuals, Azalea has stated that the tour will include "color blocking—loud, just obnoxious-type visual things", that she also characterized as "Trippy, cool, [and] colorful." Azalea also commented on the nature of the show by saying "The traditional hip-hop arena show is more focused on a DJ. I don't think it has as many props and spectacles as perhaps a pop show, which is also what I would say my show is visually like." Overall, Azalea has stated her desire for the show is "not to be too wacky" and to be "a great experience [in which fans feel] really immersed in the whole thing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ball|first=Sarah|title=Iggy Azalea Hopes She'll Still Be "Gyrating in a Leotard at 35"|url=https://www.gq.com/entertainment/music/201502/iggy-azalea-interview-grammys|work=[[GQ]]|date=20 January 2015|accessdate=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The whole point was to make no compromises, but nothing's changed in terms of my creative vision," Azalea told the [[Associated Press]] on 18 March 2014, backstage at a show for [[Samsung Galaxy]] during [[South by Southwest|SXSW]]. "It's very kind of like [[Patrick Nagel]], powerful 80s androgynous women vibe." Azalea admitted not wanting to wait until September to launch the tour, "but because the arenas are so far in advanced booked, it was kind of their next slot." She also mentioned taking advantage of the free time to finish recording her second album, "I didn't anticipate having any time to completely finish it, but now that I have kind of the time, I'd love to have an album at the end of 2015."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview: Iggy Azalea Talks 'Trouble,' Tour Postponement &amp; More with Michelle and Booker|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/iggy-azalea-social-media-tour-album-britney-spears-29746908|website=abcnews.go.com|date=19 March 2015|accessdate=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 March 2015, Azalea told ''Billboard'' at the [[iHeartRadio Music Awards]], the tour was now under the creative guidance of a new production designer, Baz Halpin, who'd been seasoning the show with a post-apocalyptic vibe, "It's going to be maybe a bit like [[Blade Runner]], full of dark and '80s ridiculous fare but not in a cliché way," also revealing she had parted ways with former tour producer AEG Live over creative differences earlier that month. "It's been great working with a new person who really understands my vision," Azalea said of Halpin, who had also fashioned the set for her performance of "[[Trouble (Iggy Azalea song)|Trouble]]" with [[Jennifer Hudson]] both at the iHeartRadio Awards and [[Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards]] on the previous day. "It's taken some of the workload off me that he's able to understand what I'm trying to achieve instead of battling it, or it being lost in translation," Azalea continued. "Some things just work. With Baz, I really don't have to say it; he's thinking what I'm thinking, and it's great. I'm super-excited about the tour," she said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iggy Azalea Is Done 'Battling' for What She Wants on Tour|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6516964/iggy-azalea-tour-iheartradio-awards-interview|work=Billboard|date=30 March 2015|accessdate=31 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rescheduling and cancellation==
On 10 March 2015, it was announced the tour was being rescheduled "due to tour production delays", according to a statement from Def Jam Recordings. After reports surfaced that the tour was to be cancelled due to lack of promotion and conflict between her and management, Def Jam announced the decision "to accommodate for creative team availability and tour productions, it was determined that the tour will not be ready this spring." They continued, "It's important to Iggy that she delivers the show she envisaged to share with her fans and that requires more time in development." The spring tour was rescheduled to the fall, kicking off on September 18 in San Diego, California. A rep for Azalea also added that "there's no truth to the rumor that there's any conflict between her and her management."&lt;ref name="bb2015"/&gt; The press release issued by AEG Live also noted tickets for dates on the tour would be valid for the new dates in the fall, with the exception of the Baltimore, Las Vegas and Sacramento shows being canceled altogether, also indicating that the opening acts for the spring tour, Nick Jonas and Tinashe, would be replaced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Varga|first=George|title=Iggy Azalea postpones her spring tour to fall|url=http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2015/mar/10/iggy-azalea-reschedules-spring-tour-for-fall/|website=utsandiego.com|date=10 March 2015|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the announcement, a message was also posted from Azalea's official Twitter account: "The tour getting pushed back only means that it'll be way more amazing than it would've been in April. Good things take time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Boardman|first=Madeline|title=Iggy Azalea Postpones The Great Escape Tour, Pushes It Months Back|url=http://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/iggy-azalea-postpones-the-great-escape-tour-pushes-it-months-back-2015103|work=[[Us Weekly]]|date=10 March 2015|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 May 2015, it was announced that the entire tour had been cancelled, with ticket holders receiving an email that stated "The Iggy Azalea Great Escape Tour scheduled for this fall has been cancelled and refunds are available at point of purchase. There will be a new tour planned around Iggy's new record to be released in 2016 and we apologize for any inconvenience."&lt;ref name="XXL"/&gt; Azalea stated, "I'm sad and sorry to let my fans down," confirming plans to "be back on the road when the next album is done."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iggy Azalea apologises to fans for cancelling tour|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/32943518/iggy-azalea-apologises-to-fans-for-cancelling-tour|work=bbc.co.uk|date=29 May 2015|accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She later issued a statement clarifying the cancellation saying she "had a different creative change of heart," in addition to being unable to find new opening acts available for the new dates she thought that would be a good fit for the tour and announcing she would also be taking a break to figure out the progression she wanted for her sound and visuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rizzo|first=Monica|title=Iggy Azalea Reveals Why She Canceled Her Upcoming Tour|url=http://www.seventeen.com/celebrity/music/news/a31241/exclusive-iggy-azalea-on-why-she-canceled-her-upcoming-tour/|work=[[Seventeen (American magazine)|Seventeen]]|date=1 June 2015|accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tour promoter, AEG Live's senior VP Debra Rathwell, stated they never put its full marketing support behind the tour, explaining, "As we were not able to fill the support slots on the tour in the fall, due to so many artists already having commitments and working this summer, we had not advertised or promoted the new shows since last winter." She added, "The dates were selling well and were going to do fine,” standing by Azalea’s creative decision to take a break and not exploring a move to smaller venues by clarifying, "there was no reason to do so. AEG LIVE is committed to her and will be working with her on her new tour." Azalea’s booking agency, CAA, also issued a statement, "The lines of communication between Iggy, myself, and her [Turn First] managers Sarah [Stennett] and Nadia [Khan] have always been open. Iggy is an incredibly talented and creative artist with a clear vision, which she continuously shares with myself and her management team."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Boardman|first=Madeline|title=Iggy Azalea Tour Cancellation Explained by AEG's Debra Rathwell &amp; CAA's Cara Lewis: Exclusive|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/business/6590031/iggy-azalea-tour-cancellation-aeg-caa-explanation|work=Billboard|date=4 June 2015|accessdate=5 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commercial performance==
After the tickets for the tour became available to the public for purchase on 19 December 2014, ''[[Forbes]]'' reported positive news for ticket sales on the primary and secondary markets. On 7 January 2015, a list compiled by [[TiqIQ]] revealed that tickets for Azalea's tour were ranked fourteenth for most expensive concert tickets of the year as of that month. On the secondary market, the average ticket price for Azalea's tour totals in about $167, therefore making the tickets some of the most expensive tickets available on the secondary market. Ticket prices for the tour managed to top artists such as the [[Foo Fighters]], but paled in comparison to artists such as [[Fleetwood Mac]], [[Maroon 5]], and [[Taylor Swift]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lawrence|first=Jesse|title=Top 15 2015 Concert Tours at the Ticket Booth|url=https://www.forbes.com/pictures/fjlg45mhfj/14-iggy-azalea-nick-jonas-the-great-escape-tour-avg-price-167-19/|work=[[Forbes]]|date=7 January 2015|accessdate=11 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2256">[[File:His Majesty's Theatre, Montreal.jpeg|thumb|His Majesty's Theatre, circa 1910.]]
'''Her Majesty's Theatre''' (also known as '''His Majesty's Theatre''') was a theatre located on [[Guy Street]] in [[Montreal|Montreal, Quebec]], Canada. For nearly 65 years it was one of the most important venues for [[orchestra]]l [[concert]]s, [[recital]]s, [[play (theatre)|plays]], [[opera]]s, and [[ballet]]s in that city.

[[File:Social. At His Majesty's Theatre BAnQ P48S1P05923.jpg|thumb|left|Spectators at a [[premiere]], His Majesty's Theatre, 1940.]]

Built in 1897-1898 during the reign of [[Queen Victoria]], the theatre was in continual operation until it was demolished in 1963. As the name of the theatre changed with the sex of the [[Monarchy of Canada|monarch of Canada]], the theatre was known as His Majesty's Theatre from 1901 to 1952, and then reverted to the title of Her Majesty's Theatre upon the accession of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]] in 1952.

It was the home of the [[Montreal Opera Company]] (1910-1913), the [[National Opera Company of Canada]] (1914), the [[Montreal Orchestra]] (1930-1941), and the [[Opera Guild of Montreal]] (1942-1963).

'''''Infierno en el Ring'' (2016)''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for "Inferno in the Ring") was a major [[professional wrestling]] event produced and scripted by the Mexican ''[[lucha libre]]'' promotion [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] (CMLL) that took place on Friday December 25, 2016 in [[Arena México]], [[Mexico City, Mexico]]. The show replaced CMLL's regularly scheduled ''[[CMLL Super Viernes]]'' show as is tradition with most of CMLL's signature events. The 2016 event marked the eight time CMLL has held a show under that name with previous shows in [[Infierno en el Ring (2008)|2008]], [[Infierno en el Ring (2009)|2009]], [[Infierno en el Ring (2010)|2010]], [[Infierno en el Ring (2012)|2012]], [[Infierno en el Ring (2013)|2013]], [[Infierno en el Ring (2014)|2014]] and [[Infierno en el Ring (2015)|2015]]. Each of the shows has featured a main event, multi-man [[Professional wrestling match types#Cages|steel cage match]], contested under ''[[Lucha de Apuestas]]'', or bet match rules referred to as ''Infierno el el Ring''. According to the rules the loser of the match, the last person to remain in the cage, would be forced to have his hair shaved off per ''Lucha Libre'' traditions.

The 2016 ''Infierno en el Ring'' event was the second time that female competitors were in the steel cage as [[La Jarochita]], [[Sanely]], [[Princesa Sugehit]], [[La Vaquerita]], [[Metálica (wrestler)|Metálica]] and [[Zeuxis (wrestler)|Zeuxis]] put their mask on the line while [[Marcela (wrestler)|Marcela]], [[Estrellita (wrestler)|Estellita]], [[Dalys la Caribeña|Dalys]] and [[La Amapola]] risked their hair on the outcome of the match. After eight women escaped the ring Zeuxis pinned La Vaquerita, forcing her to unmask and reveal her real name, Isabel Ordóñez Martínez, per ''lucha libre'' traditions. The show featured four additional matches and was shown live on CMLL's [[YouTube]] channel.

==Production==
===Background===
The Mexican [[wrestling promotion|wrestling company]] ''[[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]]'' (Spanish for "World Wrestling Council"; CMLL) has held a number of major shows over the years using the moniker ''[[Infierno en el Ring]]'' ("Inferno in the Ring"), all of which were main evented by a multi-man [[steel cage match]], the eponymous ''Infierno en el Ring'' match. CMLL has use the ''Infierno en el Ring'' match on other shows, but will intermittently hold a show billed specifically as ''Infierno en el Ring'', with the first such show held in 2008. The show has been an annual feature since 2012, with 2016 being the fifth year in a row CMLL held an ''Infierno en el Ring'' show. In 2012 and 2013 it was a summer show, but since 2014 it has been held in December.

All ''Infierno en el Ring'' shows have been held in [[Arena México]] in [[Mexico City|Mexico City, Mexico]] which is CMLL's main venue, its promotional "home".&lt;ref name=Mondo&gt;{{cite book|author=Madigan, Dan|title=Mondo Lucha A Go-Go: the bizarre &amp; honorable world of wild Mexican wrestling|publisher=HarperColins Publisher|year=2007|chapter=El nacimient de un sueño (the birth of a dream)|pages=41–50|isbn=978-0-06-085583-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 the show was held on December 25 as part of CMLL's Christmas/New Year's celebrations that also included ''[[Sin Piedad (2017)|Sin Piedad]]'' on January 1, 2017.&lt;ref name=SLPressConference&gt;{{cite web | url=http://superluchas.com/2016/12/14/cmll-conferencia-de-prensa-de-las-actividades-navidenas-de-la-empresa-infierno-en-el-ring-y-sin-piedad-ya-tienen-estelares/ | title=CMLL: Conferencia de prensa de las actividades navideñas de la empresa; “Infierno en el Ring” y “Sin Piedad” ya tienen estelares | date=December 14, 2016 | accessdate=December 28, 2016 | language=Spanish | work=SuperLuchas | author=Dark Angelita}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few days after the press conference it was announced that the show would be streamed live on CMLL's [[YouTube]] channel, something CMLL normally did not do for their Sunday shows.

===Storylines===
The event featured five [[Professional wrestling match types|professional wrestling matches]] with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing [[Screenplay|scripted]] feuds, [[plot (narrative)|plots]] and [[narrative thread|storylines]]. Wrestlers portrayed as either [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heels]] (referred to as ''rudos'' in Mexico, those that portray the "bad guys") or [[Face (professional wrestling)|faces]] (''técnicos'' in Mexico, the "good guy" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.

'''James Dallas Egbert III''' (October 29, 1962 – August 16, 1980) was a [[student]] at [[Michigan State University]] who disappeared from his [[dormitory]] room on August 15, 1979. The disappearance was widely reported in the press, and his participation in the [[fantasy]] [[role-playing game]] ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' was seized upon by press and investigators alike as being potentially related to his disappearance, propelling the previously obscure game to nationwide attention.&lt;ref name="Wired"&gt;{{cite news | last = Kushner | first = David | title = Dungeon Master: The Life and Legacy of Gary Gygax | work = Wired.com | url = http://archive.wired.com/gaming/virtualworlds/news/2008/03/ff_gygax?currentPage=all | accessdate = 2016-01-02 | date=March 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Egbert was born in [[Dayton, Ohio]] and grew up in [[Huber Heights, Ohio|Huber Heights]], a Dayton suburb, attending [[Wayne High School (Ohio)|Wayne High School]].&lt;ref name="Dear, 1984" /&gt; He was a [[child prodigy]], and entered [[Michigan State University]] at age 16, where he majored in [[computer science]]. Personal problems cited in the reports of his suicide attempt and disappearance include [[clinical depression|depression]], loneliness, parental pressure, [[drug addiction]], and (according to detective William Dear) difficulty in coming to terms with his [[homosexuality]].&lt;ref name="Dear, 1984"&gt;{{cite book |last= Dear |first= William C. |authorlink = William Dear (detective) |title= [[The Dungeon Master|Dungeon Master: The Disappearance of James Dallas Egbert III]] |publisher= [[Houghton Mifflin]] |year= 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disappearance==
On August 15, 1979, after writing a suicide note,&lt;ref&gt;"Police Seeking Genius", UPI, September 6, 1979, Lansing, Michigan&lt;/ref&gt; Egbert left his dormitory room at Case Hall and entered the university's steam tunnels.&lt;ref name="Dear, 1984" /&gt; He consumed some [[methaqualone]], intending to commit suicide, but the attempt proved unsuccessful. After waking up the next day, he went into hiding at a friend's house.&lt;ref name="The Disappearance of James Dallas Egbert III"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kushjar.com/the-disappearance-of-james-dallas-egbert-iii/ |title=The Disappearance of James Dallas Egbert III |publisher=KushJar |accessdate=13 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141212161017/http://kushjar.com/the-disappearance-of-james-dallas-egbert-iii/ |archivedate=12 December 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Investigation===
A police search for Egbert began. The story was followed widely in the news media after Michael Stuart, a journalist for the university's newspaper, ''[[The State News]]'', published details.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Egbert's parents hired a [[private investigator]], [[William Dear (detective)|William Dear]], to find their son. Knowing little about fantasy role-playing games, Dear theorized that Egbert's disappearance was related to his involvement with the ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' game, a possibility further promoted in subsequent news media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Fine |first= Gary Alan. |title= Shared Fantasy: Role-playing Games as social Worlds |publisher= [[the University of Chicago Press]] |year= 1983  |isbn= 0-226-24943-3 |pages= 254}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="designers"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Shannon Appelcline|title=Designers &amp; Dragons|publisher=Mongoose Publishing|year=2011| isbn= 978-1-907702-58-7|pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students were reported to play [[live action role-playing game|live-action sessions of the game]] in the steam tunnels below the school, and it was speculated that Egbert was injured or otherwise disappeared during such a session.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|title='Masters of Doom'|first=David|last=Kushner|date=May 4, 2003|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/04/books/chapters/0504-1st-kushner.html?pagew=&amp;pagewanted=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wired" /&gt;&lt;ref name="believer"&gt;{{cite journal | last = La Farge | first = Paul | title = Destroy All Monsters | journal = [[The Believer Magazine]] | date = September 2006 | url = http://www.believermag.com/issues/200609/?read=article_lafarge | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.believermag.com%2Fissues%2F200609%2F%3Fread%3Darticle_lafarge&amp;date=2008-10-04 | archivedate = 2008-10-04 | deadurl = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The search for Egbert continued unsuccessfully for several weeks, during which Egbert moved to two other houses in East Lansing before finally leaving the city via bus for New Orleans.&lt;ref name="Dear, 1984" /&gt;

==Discovery, eventual death==
Egbert made a second suicide attempt in [[New Orleans]] by consuming a [[cyanide]] compound, which also failed. He then moved to [[Morgan City, Louisiana]] and was employed as an [[oil field]] laborer. After four days on the job, Egbert called Dear and revealed his location. Dear traveled to Louisiana (others reported Texas) and recovered Egbert. Upon their meeting, Egbert asked the investigator to conceal the truth of his story. Dear agreed and released Egbert to the custody of his uncle, Marvin Gross, on September 13, 1979.&lt;ref name="Dear, 1984" /&gt;

Egbert died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound on August 16, 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Republic|location=Columbus, Indiana|date=August 18, 1980|page=21|title=Respirator Unplugged, Boy Genius Dies}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=When Dungeons &amp; Dragons Set Off a 'Moral Panic'|first=Clyde|last=Haberman|work=[[The New York Times]]|location=New York|date=April 18, 2016|via=[[InfoTrac]]|url=http://link.galegroup.com/apps/doc/A449822530/STND?sid=wikipedia|accessdate=March 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, Dear revealed Egbert's story in ''[[The Dungeon Master]]''.

==Legacy==
The idea of ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' players acting out real-life sessions in dangerous locations like the steam tunnels and losing touch with reality became ingrained into the cultural consciousness, inspiring movies such as ''[[Mazes and Monsters]]''.&lt;ref name="believer" /&gt; The perceived link between Egbert's disappearance and ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' was one of several [[Dungeons &amp; Dragons controversies|controversies]] linked to the game during the 1980s.

===Pritchard incident===
In 1988, during an investigation into his stepfather's murder, [[Chris Pritchard|Christopher Wayne Pritchard]] told the police that he and his friends had mapped the steam tunnels of [[North Carolina State University]] for the purposes of incorporating them into their ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' role-playing.&lt;ref name = "McGinnis, 1991"&gt;

===Fiction===
*In 1981, [[Rona Jaffe]] fictionalized the case in her novel ''[[Mazes and Monsters (novel)|Mazes and Monsters]]''. The book was adapted for the made-for-television movie ''[[Mazes and Monsters]]'' in 1982.&lt;ref name="designers"/&gt; In the novel, a group of college friends playing the role-playing game 'Mazes and Monsters' use an abandoned mine near their college campus for a live-action version of the game. One of the students (played by [[Tom Hanks]] in the movie) suffers a psychotic breakdown while playing the game.
*In 1983, an episode of ''[[The Greatest American Hero]]'' titled "Witches and Warlocks" depicted live-action role playing at a fictional university's steam plant.
*In 1984, [[Neal Stephenson]] wrote the university satire ''[[The Big U]]'', in which several live-action role playing gamers head into their university's sewers to play a game called "Sewers and Serpents".

'''Kenneth Roy Feinberg''' (born October 23, 1945) is an American [[lawyer|attorney]], specializing in [[mediation]] and [[alternative dispute resolution]]. Feinberg was appointed [[Special Master]] of the U.S. government's [[September 11th Victim Compensation Fund]] and served as the Special Master for [[Troubled Asset Relief Program|TARP]] Executive Compensation. Additionally, Feinberg served as the government-appointed administrator of the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill|BP Deepwater Horizon Disaster]] Victim Compensation Fund. Feinberg was appointed by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to administer the One Fund—the victim assistance fund established in the wake of the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings. Feinberg was also retained by [[General Motors]] to assist in their [[General Motors ignition switch scandal|recall]] response and by [[Volkswagen]] to oversee their U.S. compensation of VW diesel owners affected by the [[Volkswagen emissions scandal]]. Kenneth Feinberg is also an adjunct professor at the [[Columbia University School of Law]], [[University of Pennsylvania Law School]], [[Georgetown University Law Center]], [[New York University School of Law]], the [[University of Virginia School of Law]] and at the [[Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law]].

== Life and career ==
Feinberg was born in [[Brockton, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal =Time |title=2-min.bio: Compensation Czar Kenneth Feinberg |date=October 23, 2009 | url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1903547,00.html| accessdate=February 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received a [[Bachelor of Arts]] from the [[University of Massachusetts-Amherst]] in 1967 and a [[law degree]] from the [[New York University School of Law]] in 1970.  He worked for five years as an administrative assistant and chief of staff for U.S. Senator [[Ted Kennedy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=THE MAN BEHIND THESENATOR|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1992/09/24/the-man-behind-the-senator/6b1c2c68-35ae-411f-8397-bae8316b4f9b/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as a prosecutor for the [[U.S. Attorney General]].  Before founding his own firm The Feinberg Group (now the Law Offices of Kenneth Feinberg) in 1993, he was a founding partner at the Washington office of [[Kaye Scholer LLP]].

Feinberg has served as Court-Appointed Special Settlement Master in cases including [[Agent Orange]] [[product liability]] litigation, [[Asbestos and the law|Asbestos Personal Injury Litigation]] and [[Diethylstilbestrol|DES]] Cases.  Feinberg was also one of three arbitrators who determined the fair market value of the [[Zapruder film]] of the [[John F. Kennedy assassination|Kennedy assassination]] and was one of two arbitrators who determined the allocation of legal fees in the [[Holocaust slave labor]] litigation.  He is a former Lecturer-in-Law at a number of U.S. law schools.

Feinberg was the Chairman of the Board of Directors for the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mooney|first=Brian C.|title=JFK Library Foundation CEO steps down|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/breaking_news/2011/01/jfk_library_fou.html|newspaper=Boston Globe|date=January 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feinberg and his wife, Diane ("Dede") Shaff, have three children&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Swidey|first=Neil|title=Judge, Jury, Exchequer|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2010/06/16/judge_jury_exchequer/?page=full|newspaper=Boston Globe|date=February 1, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; and three grandchildren.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kenneth Feinberg, Weathering the Storm in the Gulf|url=http://www.aarp.org/personal-growth/transitions/info-10-2010/kenneth_feinberg_weathering_the_storm_in_the_gulf.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== September 11th Victim Compensation Fund ===
{{see also|September 11 attacks|September 11th Victim Compensation Fund}}
Appointed by Attorney General [[John Ashcroft]] to be Special Master of the fund, Feinberg worked for 33 months entirely [[pro bono]].  He developed the regulations governing the administration of the fund and administered all aspects of the program, including evaluating applications, determining appropriate compensation and disseminating awards.

====The eight-part Feinberg plan====
In his book titled ''What is Life Worth?'', Feinberg described the eight-part plan which was applied to approaching the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund. (i) Identifying someone with sufficient and exceptionally broad experience is mass tort action mediation, litigation, and settlement, which Feinberg possessed through his previous personal experience as a political activist and his work in the Agent Orange compensation settlement. (ii) To support and follow the unprecedented law of Congress for the proportional compensation of victims based on estimated loss from future earnings as a key legislated criterion. Hire a full staff of accountants and attorneys to track and service each claim individually. (iii) Accumulate all the reports and applications, along with counter-claims to gauge and initiate the direct compensation process. How the compensation fund  worked was in detail substantially different than the Agent Orange mass tort litigation case. (iv) The place of informed discretion in compensating claimants under the formula of keeping the domain of compensation (p47 of Feinberg's book) under the rule of thumb that 85% of the money should not go to 15% of the 'richest' claimant families, under the principle of "narrow the gap" between the largest and the smallest compensations paid to claimants. (v) With a mind to the future, the process of the program should be maintained and serviced as a precedent for future courts to defend in future compensation cases as needed. The actions taken should be uniform in their approach. (vi) There would be "no substitute for hard work and legal craftsmanship" of rigorous intellectual honesty. (vii) The support of Edward Kennedy would be recognized throughout the process whom Feinberg knew since 1975 (p7-8). (viii) Law suits were to be discouraged as contrary to the spirit of an enacted Law of Congress legislated to expedite the claim process of victims of September 11.&lt;ref&gt;Feinberg, Kenneth. ''What is Life Worth?: The Unprecedented Effort to Compensate the Victims of 9/11'' (2005), Perseus Books Group.&lt;/ref&gt;

====History of participation====
Early in the process he was described as aloof and arrogant. Feinberg was subjected to some very public criticism at meetings, in the media and on Web sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/lawreport/stories/2008/2302871.htm|title=The Law Report - 15July2008|publisher=ABC Radio interview transcript|accessdate=2008-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; "I underestimated the emotion of this at the beginning", Feinberg has said. "I didn't fully appreciate how soon this program had been established after 9/11, so there was a certain degree of unanticipated anger directed at me that I should have been more attuned to."&lt;ref name="abc_art"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/PersonOfWeek/story?id=131842  | author = ABC News | accessdate = January 26, 2007 | title = ABC News Person of the Week Article on Feinberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was up to Feinberg to make the decisions on how much each family of a 9/11 victim would receive.  Feinberg had to estimate how much each victim would have earned in a full lifetime.  If a family accepted the offer, it was not possible to appeal.  Families unhappy with the offer were able to appeal in a nonadversarial, informal hearing to present their case however they wanted.  Feinberg personally presided over more than 900 of the 1,600 hearings.  At the end of the process, $7 billion was awarded to 97 percent of the families.

"It's a brutal, sort of cold, thing to do. Anybody who looks at this program and expects that by cutting a [[U.S. Treasury]] check, you are going to make 9/11 families happy, is vastly misunderstanding what's going on with this program," said Feinberg.  "There is not one family member I've met who wouldn't gladly give back the check, or, in many cases, their own lives to have that loved one back. 'Happy' never enters into this equation."&lt;ref name="abc_art"/&gt;

Feinberg was able to change the mind of some of his harshest critics. Charles Wolf, whose wife died in the north tower, renamed his highly critical Web site called "Fix the Fund" to "The Fund is Fixed!".  At first he called Feinberg "patronizing, manipulative and at times, even cruel."  He later remarked, "To have one of your sharpest critics follow through on a promise and not only join the program he was criticizing, but promote it to his peers, says a lot about you and the way you have adjusted both the program and your attitude...Today, I have complete faith in you."

In 2005 his book, titled ''What is Life Worth?: The Unprecedented Effort to Compensate the Victims of 9/11'' was published.

Feinberg wrote that a widow of one firefighter cursed him "I spit on you, and your children." for being unfair in his compensation awards .&lt;ref&gt;Feinberg, Kenneth. What is Life Worth?: The Unprecedented Effort to Compensate the Victims of 9/11 (2005), Perseus Books Group, p 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hokie Spirit Memorial Fund===
{{see also|Virginia Tech shooting|Virginia Tech Foundation}}
On July 5, 2007, it was announced that Feinberg would work [[Pro bono publico|pro bono]] as the chief administrator to the [https://web.archive.org/web/20070706043713/http://www.vt.edu/fund/ Hokie Spirit Memorial Fund] (HSMF). The HSMF was set up by the Virginia Tech Foundation in the aftermath of the April 16, 2007, shooting attacks on the Virginia Tech campus. Feinberg and the university plan to disseminate a set of proposals for comment about distributions to the families in mid-July. The victims or families will have options on the ultimate uses of the funds. Payments would be completed sometime during the fall.&lt;ref name="Administrator of 9/11 fund"&gt;{{cite web | last =Hincker | first =Larry | title =Administrator of 9/11 victim compensation fund to administer Hokie Spirit Memorial Fund distributions | publisher =Virginia Tech | date =2007-07-05 | url =http://www.vtnews.vt.edu/story.php?relyear=2007&amp;itemno=385 | accessdate =2007-07-05 | deadurl =yes | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20100608020916/http://www.vtnews.vt.edu/story.php?relyear=2007&amp;itemno=385 | archivedate =2010-06-08 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Special Master for Executive Compensation===

On June 10, 2009, Feinberg was appointed by the [[U.S. Treasury Department]] to oversee the compensation of top executives at companies which have received federal bailout assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/11/business/11pay.html?hp|title=Obama Names Overseer to Set Pay at Rescued Companies |last=Labaton|first=Stephen|date=June 10, 2009|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=2009-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of his policies, he has suggested to many bank executives that they emphasize long-term stock compensation rather than cash payments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aKGZkktzkAlA&amp;pos=1|last=Goldman|first=Julia|date=February 10, 2010|publisher=Bloombergnews|accessdate=2009-02-10|title=Obama Doesn't 'Begrudge' Bonuses for Blankfein, Dimon (Update1)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Treasury Secretary [[Timothy Geithner]], in a statement about Feinberg's rulings on executive pay, said, "We all share an interest in seeing these companies return taxpayer dollars as soon as possible, and Ken today has helped bring that day a little bit closer."&lt;ref&gt;Reuters, Oct. 22, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1903547,00.html#ixzz0gBMFE6iU | work=Time | title=Compensation Czar Kenneth Feinberg | first=Frances | last=Romero | date=October 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===BP oil spill fund===
{{see also|Deepwater Horizon oil spill}}
On June 16, 2010, it was reported that Feinberg was to run a $20 billion fund to pay claims for the BP oil spill.&lt;ref&gt;https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100616/ap_on_bi_ge/us_gulf_oil_spill&lt;/ref&gt; President Obama said that the $20 billion from BP "will not be controlled by either BP or by the government. It will be put in an escrow account administered by an impartial, independent third party." Obama said he and BP's chairman, [[Carl-Henric Svanberg]], agreed on having Feinberg administer the fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/17/us/17feinberg.html | title = Feinberg distributes compensation | work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feinberg was also selected by Obama to oversee the compensation of top executives at bailed out banks.

BP is agreed to pay Feinberg's six-lawyer Washington, D.C., firm, Feinberg Rozen, a flat fee of $1,250,000 a month for labor and overhead costs, but the full details of compensation are unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Pressure on Kenneth Feinberg to disclose BP pay deal, Reuters: http://in.reuters.com/article/idINIndia-53083520101122&lt;/ref&gt; Feinberg has come under harsh criticism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oilwatchdog.org/2010/11/feinberg-cant-do-public-job-take-secret-private |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130415121017/http://www.oilwatchdog.org/2010/11/feinberg-cant-do-public-job-take-secret-private |archivedate=2013-04-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Man Who Will Spend BP's Money|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-man-who-will-spend-bps-money/}}&lt;/ref&gt; from public interest groups for refusing to disclose the amount of his compensation or the details of his arrangement with the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/companies/regulation/2011-02-02-gulf-spill-feinberg_N.htm | work=USA Today | title=Most Popular E-mail Newsletter | date=February 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 6, 2010, the [[Center for Justice &amp; Democracy]] (CJ&amp;D) sent a letter&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://centerjd.org/archives/press/2010/CJDBPTransparencyFSig12_3.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101210133929/http://www.centerjd.org/archives/press/2010/CJDBPTransparencyFSig12_3.pdf |archivedate=2010-12-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Bob Dudley|Robert Dudley]], the CEO of BP, concerning "serious new issues raised about the lack of transparency and potential conflicts of interest related to the administration of the Gulf Coast Claims Facility." In the letter, CJ&amp;D pointed out actions taken by Feinberg in the administration of the compensation fund that point to serious conflicts of interest:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Mr. Feinberg, employed by BP, has decided on his own authority that all claims recipients must release all companies who caused this disaster from any and all legal responsibility, no matter how grossly negligent they were. This sweeping release, which assigns victims' claims to BP, benefits only one actor: BP – the company that happens to pay Mr. Feinberg's salary.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In January 2011, Judge Barbier, the federal judge over the oil spill litigation, after hearing evidence and arguments of the attorneys, ruled that Kenneth Feinberg was not independent of BP and could no longer claim to be so. Feinberg had been telling victims he was their lawyer and did not answer to BP.

The letter also criticized Feinberg's lack of transparency in the matter of compensation:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Despite repeated calls for the release of documents establishing the formal relationship between BP and Feinberg Rozen, as well as its subcontractors who are reviewing and adjudicating claims, almost nothing has been publicly released. And now we learn, as reported by Reuters on November 22, 2010, that BP and Feinberg Rozen consider their arrangement 'verbal,' i.e., they have not committed to writing the firm's compensation arrangement so there can be no public examination of it. Is the public to believe that there is no paper evidence at all documenting a $10 million per year financial arrangement between BP and Feinberg Rozen? What about the contracts between BP, Feinberg Rozen and the subcontractors who are advising and adjudicating claims and also being paid directly by BP? Surely these contracts must be in writing and released. This failure to release the terms of all these financial arrangements under circumstances of tremendous historic and public significance is simply unacceptable.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Penn State settlement===
{{see also|Jerry Sandusky#Child sex abuse scandal|Penn State child sex abuse scandal}}
On September 12, 2012, Feinberg was hired by [[Penn State University]] to aid in the settlement of dozens of personal injury claims against the institution stemming from the [[Penn State child sex abuse scandal|sex abuse scandal]] involving [[Jerry Sandusky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/8403131/penn-state-nittany-lions-hire-fund-lawyer-ken-feinberg-settle-personal-injury-claims | work=ESPN.com | title=Penn State hires Ken Feinberg | date=September 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four months later, Feinberg said that he expected settlement discussions with 28 people to yield results within a matter of weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Penn State says Sandusky settlements appear close|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/local/neighborhoods-east/penn-state-says-sandusky-settlements-appear-close-672002/|newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Special Master to Oversee Treasury Implementation of Multiemployer Pension Reform Act Regulations===

The U.S. Department of the Treasury released proposed and temporary regulations to implement the Kline-Miller Multiemployer Pension Reform Act of 2014, as required by Congress. In Kline-Miller, Congress established a new process for multiemployer pension plans to propose a temporary or permanent reduction of pension benefits if the plan is projected to run out of money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Kline-Miller Multiemployer Pension Reform Act of 2014|url=https://www.treasury.gov/services/Pages/Benefit-Suspensions.aspx|publisher=US Treasury Deptarment|language=en-us}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As part of Treasury's commitment to ensuring an open and fair process, Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew appointed Kenneth Feinberg as a Special Master to help provide a dedicated, impartial and informed review of applications proposing to reduce pension benefits. Feinberg will oversee Treasury's implementation of Kline-Miller, including the review of applications to determine whether they meet the requirements set by Congress. He will also ensure that affected stakeholders have a single point of contact dedicated to this process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Treasury Releases Proposed and Temporary Multiemployer Pension Reform Act Regulations|date=June 17, 2015|url=https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/jl0078.aspx|publisher=US Treasury Department}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kenneth Feinberg to Oversee Cuts in Multiemployer Pension Plans|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/18/business/dealbook/kenneth-feinberg-to-oversee-cuts-in-multiemployer-pension-plans.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Archdiocese of New York Independent Reconciliation and Compensation Program===

In 2016, the Archdiocese of New York established the Independent Reconciliation and Compensation Program run by Kenneth Feinberg.

During past years, the Archdiocese has received various individual complaints alleging sexual abuse by clergy of the Archdiocese.  This Protocol outlines the eligibility criteria requirements and the process for these individuals to submit and resolve claims alleging such sexual abuse.  This Protocol governs only those individual claims previously submitted to the Archdiocese and will be considered Phase I of a two-phase Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Scores of sex abuse victims apply to Cardinal Dolan's program for compensation from New York Archdiocese|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/65-n-y-archdiocese-sex-abuse-vics-apply-compensation-article-1.2917953}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21148">'''Levitation''' (formerly '''Austin Psych Fest''') is an annual 3-day [[music festival]] developed and produced by [[The Reverberation Appreciation Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = LEVITATION {{!}} APRIL 29 - MAY 1, 2016 • AUSTIN, TEXAS|url = http://levitation-austin.com/|website = levitation-austin.com|access-date = 2016-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its sixth year in 2013 it has been held at Carson Creek Ranch in [[Austin, Texas]]. Inspired by the creative explosion of the 1960s, as well as by festivals such as [[All Tomorrow's Parties (music festival)|ATP]] and [[Primavera Sound]], they set out to create their vision of a music festival.

Over the years, this independent festival has grown to an internationally acclaimed, full weekend event that attracts attendees from all over the world. In 2015 Austin Psych Fest was renamed LEVITATION in honor of Austin's legendary [[psychedelic music|psychedelic]] rock godfathers [[The 13th Floor Elevators]].

The Reverberation Appreciation Society is a creative collective composed of Rob Fitzpatrick, Oswald James, and Christian Bland and Alex Maas of [[The Black Angels (band)|The Black Angels]]. In addition to the festival in Austin, the group has branched out into other cities beginning in 2013 with Levitation [[France]] and in 2015 with Levitation [[Vancouver]] and Levitation [[Chicago]]. The group also runs The Reverberation Appreciation Society record label and has curated events at Austin's [[SXSW]], The Netherlands' [[Le Guess Who?]], NYC's [[CMJ]] and NRMAL in [[Mexico City]].

== Levitation Austin ==
The first annual Austin Psych Fest was held on Saturday March 8, 2008 at The Red Barn in north [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], featuring performances by The Black Angels and [[Ringo Deathstarr]] among others.

In 2009, the festival was extended to three days and was held from March 13–15 at the Radio Room, a short lived venue on [[Sixth Street (Austin, Texas)|Sixth Street]]. [[The Seeds]]' Sky Saxon performed with Shapes Have Fangs as his backing band and Austin psychedelic legends [[The Golden Dawn (American band)|The Golden Dawn]] performed their 1968 album "Power Plant" in its entirety.  The lineup included modern psychedelic heavies [[Dead Meadow]], [[A Place to Bury Strangers]], [[Wooden Shjips]], [[The Warlocks]], and The Black Angels.

The third Austin Psych Fest was held April 23–25, 2010 at The Mohawk, a multi-stage venue on Red River. 41 acts performed, among them, [[The Raveonettes]], [[Warpaint (band)|Warpaint]], [[The Gaslamp Killer]], The Black Angels and 1960s legends [[Silver Apples]].

The 2011 festival was held on April 29-May 1 at the 1950s [[art deco]] [[Seaholm Power Plant]], a decommissioned steam power plant on the bands of [[Lady Bird Lake]] in downtown Austin that had been made temporarily available for events. Due to changes in city ordinances and construction plans, the festival changed venues 3 times before landing back at its originally intended location, The [[Seaholm Power Plant]], and the festival would be the last concert held within the plant's walls.  The 63 band bill was topped by [[Roky Erickson]] of [[The 13th Floor Elevators]], [[Spacemen 3]] offshoot Spectrum, Omar A Rodriguez group playing as [[The Mars Volta]] lineup, [[Crystal Stilts]], the first performance from [[Black Moth Super Rainbow]] in several years, and The Black Angels.

Austin Psych Fest 2012 was held  April 27–29 at the east-side location of legendary music venue [[Emo's]] in conjunction with the Beauty Ballroom.  The 5th annual festival featured a 61 band lineup including [[The Brian Jonestown Massacre]], The Black Angels, and the [[Black Lips]] along with [[Meat Puppets]], [[The Olivia Tremor Control]], [[Thee Oh Sees]], and [[Bombino (musician)|Bombino]], among others.

The 2013 and 2014 festivals were held at Carson Creek Ranch in Austin, Texas, located on the [[Colorado River]]. The 2013 festival, the 6th annual festival, held April 26–28, was the first year for the festival to be held at a completely outdoor venue, as well as the first year to have 3 stages of music, camping, and a poster series featuring US and international artists. The seventh annual festival, held May 2–4, 2014,  included 1960s legends [[The Zombies]], as well as [[Panda Bear (musician)|Panda Bear]], [[The Horrors]], [[Loop (band)|Loop]], [[The Brian Jonestown Massacre]], [[of Montreal]], [[The Dandy Warhols]], The Black Angels and many more.

In late 2014 [[The Reverberation Appreciation Society]] changed the festival's name from Austin Psych Fest to Levitation, titled after a track by Austin [[psychedelic music|psychedelic]] legends [[The 13th Floor Elevators]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Barlow|first=Eve|title=Levitation: the past, present and future of psychedelic music|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/may/11/levitation-past-present-future-psychedelic-music|accessdate=13 May 2015|newspaper=The Guardian|date=2015-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2015 festival was held May 8–10 at Carson Creek Ranch.  The lineup included [[The Flaming Lips]], [[The Jesus and Mary Chain]], [[Primal Scream]], [[Spiritualized]], [[Tame Impala]] as well as a reunion performance by [[The 13th Floor Elevators]], the band's first performance in 45 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Blackstock|first=Peter|title=13th Floor Elevators reunion a revelation at Levitation|url=http://music.blog.austin360.com/2015/05/11/13th-floor-elevators-reunion-a-revelation-at-levitation/|accessdate=13 May 2015|newspaper=Austin360|date=2015-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dates for the 2016 festival were April 29 - May 1, 2016, and the lineup featured Brian Wilson performing Pet Sounds, Ween, Animal Collective, Caribou, Flying Lotus, Slowdive, Courtney Barnett, Sleep, The Arcs, Brian Jonestown Massacre and many more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2016/04/top-10-music-festivals-spring-2016-power-rankings/|title=Top 10 Music Festivals: Spring 2016 Power Rankings|date=2016-04-04|work=Consequence of Sound|access-date=2017-06-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2016 festival at Carson Creek Ranch was cancelled due to severe weather, resulting in significant damage to the festival grounds and infrastructure. In response over 20 concerts were organized in downtown Austin hosting the lineup and attendees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://noisey.vice.com/en_us/article/levitation-2016-photo-essay|title=Salvaging a Good Time from the Wreckage of Levitation 2016|website=Noisey|language=en-us|access-date=2017-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2016, festival organizers announced that the festival would not be held in 2017, but would return in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/austinpsychfest/photos/a.306659636848.145888.163213341848/10154206026301849/?type=3&amp;theater|title=LEVITATION|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2017-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, this is speculation and has not been proven.

[[Levonorfenfluramine]], an active metabolite of levofenfluramine, is also a fairly potent serotonin releasing agent (with a potency of approximately 1/2 that of norfenfluramine and 1/6th that of dexfenfluramine) and, similarly to dexnorfenfluramine, is a 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2B&lt;/sub&gt; and 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2C&lt;/sub&gt; receptor agonist, as well as a somewhat less potent [[norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor]] (about 1/2 that of its efficacy as a serotonin releaser).&lt;ref name="pmid11104741" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid11888573" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17017961" /&gt; As such, likely contributes significantly to the [[biological activity]]—though not necessarily appetite suppressant effects—of not only levofenfluramine but of racemic fenfluramine as well. In contrast to levonorfenfluramine, levofenfluramine is virtually inactive as a reuptake inhibitor or releaser of [[norepinephrine]],&lt;ref name="pmid17017961" /&gt; and neither compound has any effect on [[dopamine]] reuptake or release.&lt;ref name="pmid17017961" /&gt;

American singer [[Katy Perry]] has released five [[studio albums]] as well as an [[acoustic music|acoustic album]] and two [[Live album|live albums]] since her debut in 2001. This has resulted in four concert tours (all of them worldwide), and a lot of TV and [[Award show|award shows]] performances. In 2001 she released her first studio album ''[[Katy Hudson (album)|Katy Hudson]]'' under the stage name [[Katy Hudson]]; her first and only Christian music album. Since adopting the stage name Katy Perry, she has been promoting all of her albums, starting with her second album ''[[One of the Boys (Katy Perry album)|One of the Boys]]'' in 2008 and 2009, through performances at several festivals including the [[Jingle Ball]] and the [[MTV Video Music Awards 2008|MTV Video Music Awards]].

In 2009 she embarked on her debut headlining concert tour, [[Hello Katy Tour]], which visited [[North America]], [[Europe]], [[Asia]] and [[Oceania]] and grossed over $1.5 million from 89 shows. In November 2009, Perry released her first [[extended play]]/live album: ''[[MTV Unplugged (Katy Perry EP)|MTV Unplugged]]'' in collaboration with [[MTV]]. She embarked on her second world tour [[California Dreams Tour]] in 2011 to promote her third studio album ''[[Teenage Dream (Katy Perry album)|Teenage Dream]]''.&lt;ref name="euro"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/katy-perry-announces-european-dates-for-2011-tour-2104769.html|title=Katy Perry announces European dates for 2011 tour|date=October 12, 2010|work=The Independent|accessdate=November 25, 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tour visited Europe, Oceania, Asia, North America and [[South America]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8709">The '''Machangulo Affair''' was a social and (eventually) political controversy that took place in the [[Netherlands]] in 2009. It involved a decision in 2007 by Dutch [[heir apparent|crown prince]] [[Willem-Alexander, Prince of Orange|Willem-Alexander]] and his wife [[Princess Máxima of the Netherlands|princess Máxima]] to invest in a land development project in [[Machangulo]] (in [[Mozambique]]). It ended on November 20, 2009 with the decision to sell the property.

==Background==
On 10 July 2008, the Prince and Princess announced that they had &amp;ndash; in the second half of 2007 &amp;ndash; invested in a development project on the [[Mozambique|Mozambican]] peninsula of [[Machangulo]]. The development project in question was aimed at building an ecologically responsible vacation resort, including a hotel and several luxury vacation houses for investors. In addition the project was to invest heavily in the local economy of the peninsula (building schools, wells and housing for the local populace) with an eye both towards "responsible sustainability" and maintaining a local staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trouw.nl/tr/nl/4324/Nieuws/article/detail/1280749/2008/07/10/Willem-Alexander-wil-huis-voor-kust-Mozambique.dhtml |title=Willem-Alexander wil huis voor kust Mozambique |date=July 10, 2008 |publisher=Trouw.nl |accessdate=23 January 2015|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The royal couple stated that they had been attracted to the project since it seemed to be a perfect match for their desires and interests: on the one hand a vacation resort far away, where they might take holidays without too many prying eyes; and on the other ecologically and sustainably responsible, investing in the local economy and ecology (which the Prince and Princess both have a personal interest in). Plus located in [[Africa]], a continent that has been dear to several generations of the royal family. So, after contacting Mozambican president [[Armando Guebuza]] to verify that the Mozambican government had no objections, the couple decided to invest.&lt;ref name="ADPres"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ad.nl/ad/nl/1000/Nieuws/article/detail/445318/2009/11/19/Prins-had-contact-met-president-Mozambique.dhtml |title=Prins had contact met president Mozambique |date=November 19, 2009 |publisher=[[Algemeen Dagblad]] |accessdate=11 June 2010|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
The announcement of the investment was initially not considered anything special in the Netherlands and was generally considered to be "information". However, in the course of 2009 there was quite a bit of controversy surrounding the project and the Prince's position in relation to it. There were reports in the press of corruption involving a contractor in the project, who turned out to have embezzled money from a number of investors (not the Prince, however). A local police chief was arrested for having murdered a local who was protesting the project. And shortly after that a report was published stating that there had been serious delays in building facilities for the local population (those facilities have been completed since). Also, there were questions about some of the investors (particularly members of the [[Flick family]]) and whether it was such a wonderful idea for the Prince to be neighbors with them.&lt;ref name="NOS_mysterie"&gt;{{cite web |title=Het mysterie van Machangulo |author=Tim de Wit |publisher=NOS |date=October 6, 2009 |url=http://nos.nl/artikel/96190-het-mysterie-van-machangulo.html|language=nl|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407011816/http://nos.nl/artikel/96190-het-mysterie-van-machangulo.html|archivedate=2012-04-07|accessdate=2015-01-23|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Towards November 2009 the rumors and speculation intensified, although there were also opinions issued in favor of the purchase.&lt;ref name="OpinieVanDerAa"&gt;{{cite news |title=Villa kroonprins is juist goed voor Mozambique |author=Gerbert van der Aa |newspaper=NRC Handelsblad |date=November 4, 2009 |url=http://www.nrc.nl/opinie/article2404868.ece/Villa_kroonprins_is_juist_goed_voor_Mozambique |accessdate=August 27, 2010|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; On top of corruption charges and project delays, there were rumors about the local population losing fishing grounds due to the closing of a 20 kilometer stretch of beach for private use of the resort and a protest by the local population being put down by the [[army]], using gunfire (both rumors were later denied, the latter one by Dutch [[prime minister]] [[Jan Peter Balkenende]]&lt;ref name="ADPres"/&gt;). 

In the course of 2009 there were several scandals and semi-scandals involving the royal couple (including a [[lawsuit]] against the [[Associated Press]]), as well as other members of the royal house. Several of these involved family finances (general expenses of the royal house, tax shelters being run from the Palace, travel expenses, use of a naval shipyard for the work on the [[Beatrix of the Netherlands|Queen's]] personal yacht). These rumors came at a time in which the Netherlands was starting to feel the effects of the [[late-2000s recession]] and negatively impacted the royal families popularity. This general downturn in popular support for the royals may have fed the political criticism that followed.

In November 2009 politicians such as [[Alexander Pechtold]] had started simply questioning the morality of building a luxury resort in a poor country such as Mozambique.&lt;ref name="NRC"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nrc.nl/international/Features/article2421003.ece/Crown_prince_bows_to_public_pressure_over_Mozambique_villa |title=Crown prince bows to public pressure over Mozambique villa |date=November 23, 2009 |publisher=NRC |accessdate=11 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; And there were questions about the Prince's behavior on rumors that he had "wined until he had gotten his way" and that he had "pushed ahead on the project without consulting the prime minister".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/netherlands/6284941/Dutch-Crown-Prince-Willem-Alexander-accused-over-Mozambique-villa.html |title=Dutch Crown Prince Willem-Alexander accused over Mozambique villa |date=October 10, 2009 |publisher=Telegraph |accessdate=11 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nu.nl/binnenland/2115552/beatrix-vakantiehuis-mozambique.html |title='Beatrix is tegen vakantiehuis Mozambique'  |date=November 3, 2009 |publisher=Nu.nl |accessdate=23 January 2015|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; These rumors were always attributed to an "anonymous source near the government", so their reliability is unclear; however, the unquestioning way they were accepted by a relatively large section of the public says something about the mood in the Netherlands towards the end of 2009. 

Finally, in November, there were a number of parliamentary debates on the issue and prime minister Balkenende was even called to answer questions. In these questions he explained that the project was a private affair of the Prince, but that extra distance had been created between the Prince and the business of the project to avoid entanglements. The extra distance came in the form of a [[Private foundation|foundation]] that managed the Prince's investment. The press called the independence of that foundation into question however, because it was run by a personal friend of the Prince's.&lt;ref name="NRC"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ad.nl/ad/nl/1013/Buitenland/article/detail/2067945/2009/10/29/Villa-van-kroonprins-zorgt-weer-voor-ophef.dhtml |title=Villa van kroonprins zorgt weer voor ophef |date=October 29, 2009 |publisher=[[Algemeen Dagblad]] |accessdate=2 May 2013|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, on November 20, the prime minister returned to parliament to announce that the Prince and Princess had decided, due to the public and parliamentary controversy, to sell the property in Machangulo once their house was completed. To this end he read a letter in parliament written by the Prince personally (an unusual event, since ministerial responsibility dictates that royals are usually not quoted directly in parliament).

In January 2012, it was confirmed that the villa had been sold back to Machangulo SA. Prime Minister [[Mark Rutte]] stated that the Crown Prince and Princess have no further involvement with the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nos.nl/koningshuis/artikel/331249-prins-verkoopt-villa-in-mozambique.html | title=Prins verkoopt villa in Mozambique | date=Jan 18, 2012 | publisher=[[Nederlandse Omroep Stichting]] | accessdate=2 May 2013|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Midburn ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: מידברן; [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: ميدبيرن) is a 6-day event held in the [[Negev|Negev Desert]] in southern [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Inside Midburn, Israel’s version of Burning Man | url = http://america.aljazeera.com/multimedia/photo-gallery/2014/6/photos-inside-israelsownburningmanfestival.html | author = | journal = [[Al Jazeera]] | date = 9 June 2014 | accessdate = 16 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first annual event was held in June, 2014, and was attended by 3,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Midburn in Israel’s Negev desert was a bizarre first attempt at the popular US festival Burning Man | url = http://www.news.com.au/travel/world-travel/midburn-in-israels-negev-desert-was-a-bizarre-first-attempt-at-the-popular-us-festival-burning-man/story-e6frfqc0-1226950365238 | author = | journal = [[News.com.au]] | date = 11 June 2014 | accessdate = 16 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second event was held in May 20-24, 2015, and was attended by 6,500 people. The name itself is a [[portmanteau]] of the Hebrew word for "desert" (מידבר ''midbar'') and the English word "burn" in reference to the annual [[Burning Man]] festival in the [[Nevada desert]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Now You Can Go to Burning Man After Birthright | url = http://time.com/2848120/israel-burning-man/ | author = | journal = [[Time (magazine)|TIME]] | date = 9 June 2014 | accessdate = 16 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The festival is held near [[Sde Boker]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Israele: il Midburn festival, il deserto diventa "creativo" | url = http://www.repubblica.it/esteri/2014/06/09/foto/midburn_festival_follie_e_condivisione_nel_deserto_israeliano-88484567/ | author = | journal = [[la Repubblica]] | language = Italian | date = 11 June 2014 | accessdate = 16 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the themes of the event are creativity, art and personal expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Midburn : festival déjanté en plein désert d'Israël | url = http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/galeries-photos/photo/20140610.OBS0008/photos-midburn-festival-dejante-en-plein-desert-d-israel.html | author =  Cyril Bonnet | journal = [[Le Nouvel Observateur]] | language = French | date = 10 June 2014 | accessdate = 16 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The burn is held every year in May or June, around the Hebrew holiday of "[[Shavuot]]" (Pentecost), and culminates in a bonfire of wooden sculptures.  The third Midburn event, in 2016, had an attendance of 8,000 participants, making it the 2nd biggest regional event outside the US, after [[AfrikaBurn]]. As of 2018, it is the only Burning Man regional event in the [[Middle East]].

'''''Miss Match''''' is an American [[comedy-drama]] television series created by Jeff Rake and [[Darren Star]] and [[production company|produced]] by [[20th Century Fox Television]], Darren Star Productions, and [[Imagine Entertainment|Imagine Television]]. It aired in the United States on [[NBC]], Australia on [[Seven Network]], [[Arena (TV network)|Arena]], and [[Fox8]], and in the United Kingdom on [[Sky Living|Living]], [[Channel 4]], and is on [[E4 (channel)|E4]]. Seventeen episodes of the series were filmed, with eleven aired in the United States. The entire series aired in both the UK and Canada.

Starring [[Alicia Silverstone]] and [[Ryan O'Neal]], the show garnered poor ratings, which could have been due to its inability to compete in the Friday 8&amp;nbsp;pm ET timeslot (the "[[Friday night death slot]]"). It was based on the real-life story of [[Samantha Daniels]].

==Premise==
A Los Angeles [[matrimony|matrimonial]] attorney, Kate Fox (Alicia Silverstone), doubles as a high-end [[matchmaking|matchmaker]] even though her own love life is far from perfect.

==Cast and characters==
===Main===
[[File:Missmatch poster.jpg|thumb|The cast of ''Miss Match'']]
* [[Alicia Silverstone]] as Kate Fox: A divorce lawyer by day who ends up becoming a match maker. Her own romantic life is complicated. Throughout the series she is involved with Michael and later his best friend, Adam. Kate often finds herself getting involved in the relationships she sets up for people. Various characters mention to her that she is addicted to love and lives through the lives of others.
* [[Lake Bell]] as Victoria Carlson: Kate's best friend who is a bartender. She often oversees the dates Kate sets people up with. She tends to only have flings with men, like the one she starts with Nick. The only man we see her like as more than a hookup is Adam.
* [[David Conrad]] as Michael Mendelson: Kate's on and off again boyfriend after she sets him up on several dates. His ex-girlfriend is Lauren who left him for his best friend Adam.
* [[Jodi Long]] as Claire: A secretary at Fox &amp; Associates.
* [[James Roday]] as Nick Paine: Kate's co-worker who is a womanizer. He and Kate tolerate each other, at best. He later dates Victoria.
* [[Ryan O'Neal]] as Jerry Fox: Kate's father who owned the law firm she works for. He was not a perfect father to Kate but they bonded over law. He is shown to still have feelings for Kate's mother but is not hung up on her. Later in the series he is linked with Serena.

===Recurring===
* [[Charisma Carpenter]] as Serena Lockner: An old classmate of Kate who comes back into her life. Kate helps her adopt a baby and give it back to the mother when she realizes she made a mistake. She later returns and starts a romance with Kate's father.
* [[Dina Meyer]] as Lauren Logan: Michael's ex-girlfriend and Adam's ex-wife. After finding out that Michael and Kate are involved, she makes Kate break it off. After finding out Adam and Kate are involved, she sues Kate's law firm for malpractice.
* [[Nathan Fillion]] as Adam Logan: Adam comes to town after Lauren hires Kate as her divorce lawyer. He and Michael end up repairing their friendship but he soon becomes involved with Kate and Victoria.

NBC had a cross promotion where Deanna Wright, [[Galen Gering]] and [[McKenzie Westmore]], who starred on NBC's soap opera ''[[Passions]]'', appeared in an episode of the series.

The series was executive produced by [[Darren Star]], who also directed the pilot, and Jeff Rake,&lt;ref name="Variety#1"&gt;{{cite web |last=Feiwell |first=Jill |url=https://variety.com/2003/scene/markets-festivals/from-sex-to-single-in-the-city-l-a-meets-its-match-1117889623/ |title=From 'Sex' to single in the city: L.A.

==History==
[[Image:Concert18.jpg|thumb|left|The ''Grote Zaal'' (Great Hall) of the [[Concertgebouw]] after which the Baltimore Lyric Opera House was modeled.]]

===Opera and music at the Lyric===
Prior to the 1909 purchase of the building on behalf of the Metropolitan Opera by [[Otto Kahn]], [[Oscar Hammerstein I]] presented an opera season and began to make plans to remodel it by enlarging the stage area.  However Kahn's purchase caused the venue's name to be changed to the Lyric Theatre.&lt;ref name=MODELL&gt;
[http://www.lyricoperahouse.com/page.php?cms_id=54 Lyric Opera House history] on lyricoperahouse.com.  Retrieved 12 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt; and firmed up the continuity of the [[Metropolitan Opera]]'s annual visits. In the early 20th century, the Lyric Opera featured opera tenor [[Enrico Caruso]] who appeared there with the Metropolitan Opera in a performance of [[Friedrich von Flotow|Flotow]]'s ''[[Martha (opera)|Martha]]''.

In 1950, building on earlier amateur efforts, the Baltimore Opera was formally established as the '''Baltimore Civic Opera Company''', with the famous American [[soprano]] [[Rosa Ponselle]] as its first [[artistic director]]. She brought [[Beverly Sills]] to Baltimore for a production of ''[[Manon]]'' in 1952. By 1970, the name was changed to '''Baltimore Opera Company ''' and had become firmly established at the Lyric.

Having been modeled on the Concertgebouw, the Lyric was primarily used as a concert hall. 1916 saw the founding of the [[Baltimore Symphony Orchestra]] which presented performances there until 1982, while the building was purchased from Kahn in 1920 and a significant renovation created an enlarged balcony with seating capacity reaching 2,800. In March 1974, the Lyric's 75th anniversary featured the return of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, and throughout these years, the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]] made regular appearances in Baltimore until April 1980. A highlight was the 1934 premiere of [[Rachmaninoff]]'s ''[[Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini]]'', with the composer at the piano.

===Other events===
Many different kinds of events were presented at the Lyric, including sporting events such as the 1905 lightweight boxing fight between [[Joe Gans]], the lightweight champion, and Mike Sullivan and the 1906 wrestling bout between Gus Schoenlein and the world champion, [[George Hackenschmidt]], the world champion of the time. The first public showing of electric cooking in Baltimore took place, as well as hosting speakers like [[Aimee Semple McPherson]], [[Will Rogers]], [[Richard Evelyn Byrd|Richard Byrd]], [[Clarence Darrow]], [[Amelia Earhart]], [[Charles Lindbergh]] and [[William Jennings Bryan]].

Performers appearing at the Lyric included in April/May 1984 [[Yul Brynner]] who starred in ''[[The King and I]]'' which over 70,000 people attended in four weeks.  That same year, Patti Labelle's performances sold out five performances while, in 1987, ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]'' played to over 75,000 people.

===Creating an opera house===
Major renovations from 1980-1982 completed its transformation into an opera house.

====Demographics====
[[File:Moscopole coa.jpg|thumb|left|180px|The coat of arms of Moscopole.]]
Although located in a rather isolated place in the mountains of southern Albania, the city rose to become the most important center of the Aromanians. It was a small settlement until the end of the 17th century, but afterwards showed a remarkable financial and cultural development.&lt;ref name=Miropoulos&gt;{{Cite book |last=Mikropoulos |first=Tassos A. |title=Elevating and Safeguarding Culture Using Tools of the Information Society: Dusty traces of the Muslim culture

According to the Swedish historian [[Johann Thunmann]], who visited Moscopole and wrote a history of the Aromanians in 1774, everyone in the city spoke Aromanian; many also spoke Greek, which was used for writing contracts, in fact the city is said to have been mainly populated by Vlachs/Aromanians. The fact was confirmed by a 1935 analysis of the family names shows that the majority of the population were indeed Vlachs, but there were also Greeks and Albanians present in the city.&lt;ref name=Stavrianos/&gt;

====Economy====
[[File:Voskopoja church.jpg|thumb|right|Murals of St. Nicholas church, painted by [[David Selenica]].]]
Historically the main economic activity of the city was the livestock farming. The alternative name "Voskopolis" means "City of shepherds".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=FPNMAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA35&amp;lpg=PA35&amp;dq=%CE%B2%CE%BF%CF%83%CE%BA%CF%8C%CF%80%CE%BF%CE%BB%CE%B9%CF%82&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=BdBQRFHwgb&amp;sig=xEv1noI9VEkeUwrBVJpvGXE4BtE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Lv4IUInILOGM0AWy7OzhCg&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%CE%B2%CE%BF%CF%83%CE%BA%CF%8C%CF%80%CE%BF%CE%BB%CE%B9%CF%82&amp;f=false Anonymous, Geographikon tēs Rhumunias ...

In Greek.]&lt;/ref&gt;  This activity led to the establishment of wool processing and carpet manufacturing units and the development of tanneries, while other locals became metal workers, silver and copper smiths.&lt;ref name=Miropoulos/&gt;  During the middle of the 18th century, the city became an important economic center whose influence spread over the boundaries of the [[Orthodox Archbishopric of Ohrid (ancient)|Archbishopric of Ohrid]], and reached further the Ottoman ruled Eastern-Orthodox world: the trade involved as far as the Archduchy of Austria, the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1538–1867)|Kingdom of Hungary]], and the [[Electorate of Saxony|Upper Saxony]]. Until 1769, the town traded on a large scale with renowned European commercial centres of that time, such as [[Venice]], [[Vienna]] and [[Leipzig]].&lt;ref name=Rousseva/&gt;

====Culture====
A printing press was also operating in Moscopole which was the second one in Ottoman Europe (in {{lang-tr|İskopol/Oskopol}},&lt;ref name="Albanians and mountain bandits"/&gt;) after that of Constantinople. This establishment produced a total of nineteen books, mainly Services to the Saints but also the ''Introduction of Grammar'' by the local scholar [[Theodore Kavalliotis]].&lt;ref name=Miropoulos/&gt; The later became director of the city's  prestigious educational institution, which from 1744 was known as [[New Academy (Moscopole)|New Academy]] or ''Hellenikon Frontistirion'', sponsored by the wealthy merchants of the diaspora. Moreover, the city hosted an [[orphanage]], known as ''Orphanodioiketerion'', probably the first in the post-Byzantine Orthodox world,&lt;ref&gt;Anthony L. Scott.

A cultural effervescence arose in Moscopole, and many authors published their works in both the [[Greek language]] (which was the language of culture of the Balkans at the time) and [[Aromanian language|Aromanian]], written in the [[Greek alphabet]]. In 1770, the first dictionary of four modern Balkan languages ([[Greek language|Greek]], [[Albanian language|Albanian]], Vlach/[[Aromanian language|Aromanian]] and [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]]) was published here. [[Daniel Moscopolites]] a Vlach-speaking native priest of Moscopole, compiled a quadrilingual lexicon of [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Vlach]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] and [[Albanian language|Albanian]], that aimed at the [[hellenization]] of the non-Greek-speaking Christian communities in the [[Balkans]].&lt;ref&gt;Friedman A.

The survivors were thus forced to flee, most of them emigrating mainly to [[Thessaly]] and [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]]. Some of the commercial elite moved to the [[Archduchy of Austria]], and the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1538–1867)|Kingdom of Hungary]] especially to the respective capitals of [[Vienna]] and [[Budapest]], but also to [[Principality of Transylvania (1711–1867)|Transylvania]], where they had an important role in the early [[National awakening of Romania]].

Moscopolis: The old Vlach-speaking inhabitants of Moscopolis dispersed in all directions at the end of the eighteenth century, because the Moslem Albanians living round about pillages that once famed city, and the comparatively few remaining families gradually moved elsewhere, particularly to Korçë, which slowly became an important commercial centre. Of the old Vlach families, only about thirty remain in Moscopolis; but on the other hand, the widespread disorder ravaging the area of Opar has caused many Albanian speaking families to leave the barren, mountainous parts of the country and remove to Moscopolis, where they till the land and raise livestock. Able Vlach-speaking families came from two Vlach settlements to Moscopolis, of which the entire population at present amounts to 200 families, of which 120 are Albanian-speaking and the remaining 80 Vlach speaking. All the old Vlach-speaking families have remained true to [their Greek national consciousness], but for three, who, together with some of the newcomers, have been led astray by the unfrocked priest Kosmas. The Romanising families there number twenty in all."&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1914 Moscopole was part of the [[Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus]]. It was destroyed again in 1916 during [[World War I]] by the marauding Albanian bands of [[Sali Butka]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=el&amp;id=dkRoAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=winnifrith+epirus&amp;q=marauding&amp;pgis=1#search_anchor Badlands, borderlands: a history of Northern Epirus/Southern Albania.] Tom Winnifrith.

During recent years, a Greek language institution, a joint Greek-Albanian initiative, has operated in Moscopole.&lt;ref name=Qaja118&gt;{{cite web|last=Καγιά|first=Έβις|script-title=el:Το Ζήτημα της Εκπαίδευσης στην Ελληνική Μειονότητα και οι Δίγλωσσοι Μετανάστες Μαθητές στα Ελληνικά Ιδιωτκά Σχολεία στην Αλβανία|url=http://invenio.lib.auth.gr/record/66383|publisher=[[University of Thessaloniki]]|accessdate=6 February 2013|pages=118–121|language=Greek|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moscopole, known in Albania as being a traditionally Christian settlement is neighbours with various Muslim and Christian Albanian villages that surround it, although the latter have become "demographically depressed", due to migration.&lt;ref name="De Rapper3"/&gt; During the communist period some Muslim Albanians from surrounding villages settled in Moscopole making locals view the village population as mixed (''i përzier'') and lamenting the decline of the Christian element.&lt;ref name="De Rapper3"&gt;{{cite journal|last=De Rapper|first=Gilles|title=Religion on the border: sanctuaries and festivals in post-communist Albania|url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00400432/document|journal=|volume=|issue=|year=2010|pages=3|ref=harv|quote="The three villages are known as Christians villages where Muslims have recently settled, especially during communist times, so that today their population is said to be 'mixed‘ (i përzier).

In the case of Voskopojë and Vithkuq, this loss is told in a more dramatic mode: both villages are known to have been prosperous Christian cities in the 18th century, before they were plundered and destroyed during repeated attacks by local Muslims."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
[[File:Voskopoje St Athanasius.JPG|thumb|Decorated exonarthex of St. Athanasius' Church]]
[[File:Voskopoje St Charalampus.JPG|thumb|Ruined St. Charalampus' Church]]
The remaining churches in the region are among the most representative of 18th century ecclesiastical art in the Balkans. Characteristically, their [[mural]]s are comparable to that in the large monastic centres at [[Mount Athos]] and [[Meteora]] in [[Greece]]. The architectural design is in general specific and identical: a large three-aisled [[basilica]] with a
gable roof. The churches are single-apsed, with a wide altar apse and internal niches that serve as [[Prothesis (altar)|prothesis]] and [[diaconicon]]. Most churches also have one niche, each on the northern and southern walls, next to the prothesis and the diakonicon. Along the southern side there is an arched porch.&lt;ref name=Rousseva/&gt;

The '''murder of Jamiel Shaw II''' occurred on March 2, 2008, in [[Arlington Heights, Los Angeles]], California. Shaw, a 17-year-old [[Los Angeles High School]] football player, was shot by two [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic]] men while returning home from the [[Beverly Center]]. Shaw was taken to a hospital, where he later died.&lt;ref name=LATimes&gt;{{cite web|url=http://homicide.latimes.com/post/jamiel-shaw/|title=Jamiel Shaw, 17|publisher=The Homicide Report|agency=''[[Los Angeles Times]]''|date=March 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A gang member, Pedro Espinoza, was later apprehended and convicted of the murder. Because Espinoza was an [[Alien (law)|illegal immigrant]] who had just been released from jail, the shooting sparked controversy and political debate over [[Los Angeles]]' status as a [[sanctuary city]], and over [[Special Order 40]].

==Backgrounds==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2016}}

===Jamiel Shaw II===
Jamiel "Jas" Andre Shaw, II (December 22, 1990&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.californiabirthindex.org/birth/jamiel_andre_shaw_born_1990_20265960 Jamiel Andre Shaw, Born 12/22/1990 in California]. California Birth Index.  Retrieved Sep 25, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; March 2, 2008) was a junior at [[Los Angeles High School]]. He played football, basketball, baseball, the piano, and ran track. On the morning of his murder, he had participated in a weekend football training program, that prepares top high school football players for college football and for a possible career in the [[National Football League]]. Shaw was also being prospected by several colleges, including [[Rutgers University]] and [[Stanford University]].{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} Shaw's mother Anita was serving her second tour in [[Iraq]] at the time of his death.

===Pedro Espinoza===
Pedro Espinoza (born {{circa}} 1989) was a member of the [[18th Street Gang]] and was residing in the U.S. [[Illegal immigration to the United States|illegally]]. He had previously been arrested in November 2007 on gun charges and assault on a police officer. He was given a four-month early release from jail on March 1, 2008. A day after Shaw's murder, Espinoza reported to his probation officer.

==Shooting==
In the early evening of March 2, 2008, Shaw was returning home from the [[Beverly Center]]. He was walking from the bus stop when his father, Jamiel Sr., called him on his phone. Shaw answered the phone and told him he was nearby. He was three blocks away from his home when he was killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Esquivel|first=Paloma|first2=Paul|last2=Pringle|first3=Francisco|last3=Vara-Orta|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/mar/04/local/me-shot4|title=A youth 'on track' until fatal gunfire|work=Los Angeles Times|date=March 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At about 8:40 p.m., two Hispanic men jumped out of a white car, confronted Shaw, and asked him what gang he belonged to. When  he did not answer quickly enough, they shot him. Shaw's father heard the gunshots, ran outside, and stayed by his son until medical personnel arrived. Shaw was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 9:55 p.m.&lt;ref name=LATimes/&gt;

Shaw was first shot in the stomach, causing him to fall to the ground. While he was on the ground with his hands over his head, he was shot through his hands, with the bullet then traveling into his face.{{cn|date=June 2016}}

Within an hour of Shaw's murder, Espinoza was found in a park by a [[Culver City, California|Culver City]] police officer who was not aware of the shooting. Because the park was closed, he was told to leave. The officer wrote down the license plate number of his vehicle and later shared it with the [[Los Angeles Police Department]]. Espinoza was later arrested.{{cn|date=June 2016}}

==Legal proceedings==
Espinoza was formally charged with [[first-degree murder]]. He was convicted on May 9, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kim|first=Victoria|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/may/10/local/la-me-jamiel-shaw-20120510|title=Gang member convicted of murdering Los Angeles High football star|work=Los Angeles Times|date=May 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The guilty verdict also included [[Special circumstances (criminal law)|special circumstances]], which made Espinoza eligible for the [[Capital punishment in California|death penalty]]. On May 23, 2012, the jury sentenced Espinoza to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lowery|first=Wesley|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/nov/02/local/la-me-1103-jamiel-shaw-20121104|title=Gang member sentenced to die in star athlete's killing|work=Los Angeles Times|date=November 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/los-angeles/story/_/id/8584686/pedro-espinoza-gets-death-sentence-2008-murder-jamiel-shaw-ii|title=Pedro Espinoza gets death sentence|work=[[Associated Press]]|date=November 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lawsuit===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2016}}
In 2009, the Shaw family filed a [[wrongful death]] lawsuit against [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]] and Sheriff [[Lee Baca]]. The suit also alleged negligence, violation of the [[Immigration and Nationality Act]], and deprivation of civil rights. In 2010, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Charles F. Palmer determined that the defendants were [[Legal immunity|legally immune]] from the action, and dismissed the lawsuit.

==Funeral==
Shaw's funeral was held on March 11, 2008, at the [[West Angeles Church of God in Christ]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-shaw12mar12-pg-photogallery.html|title=Funeral Service for Jamiel Shaw|work=Los Angeles Times|date=March 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction==
Shaw's murder sparked criticism and political debate&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Palta|first=Rina|url=http://www.scpr.org/news/2012/11/02/34809/pedro-espinoza-case-murder-spurred-immigration-fig/|title=Pedro Espinoza murder case that spurred immigration fight expected to end|work=[[KPCC]]|date=November 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; over Los Angeles' [[sanctuary city]] policy and [[Special Order 40]], which aimed to strengthen community safety by disallowing local officials from questioning a resident's immigration status, thus enabling local victims of crime to file reports without fear of deportation.

In rapper [[Ice Cube]]'s music video "[[Why Me? (Ice Cube song)|Why Me?]]", the Jamiel Shaw case is prominently featured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/jamiel-shaws-killing-lamented-ice-120370|title=Jamiel Shaw's killing lamented in Ice Cube video|publisher=''Hollywood Reporter''|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jamiel's Law===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2016}}
In response to the controversy, the Shaw family is supporting "Jamiel's Law", which would rescind Special Order 40. Mayoral candidate [[Walter Moore (politician)|Walter Moore]] campaigned as a supporter of this initiative. An attempt to get this proposal onto the May 2009 election ballot failed, when supporters did not gather enough signatures.

===Reaction from victim's family===
Shaw's parents became supporters of [[Donald Trump]]'s [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|2016 presidential campaign]]. Shaw Sr. was featured in a Trump television advertisement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.donaldjtrump.com/media/jamiel-tv-spot|title=Jamiel - TV Spot|publisher=[[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|Donald J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2908">A '''no-show job''' is a paid position that ostensibly requires the holder to perform duties, but for which no work, or even attendance, is actually expected. The awarding of no-show jobs is a form of [[political corruption|political]] or [[corporate corruption]].

== Organized crime and corruption ==

''[[The New York Times]]'' has written: "The no-show job has long played a central role in the annals of [[Crime in New York|crime]] and corruption in New York, offering an efficient way for crooked politicians, [[Trade union|union]] officials, [[Organized crime|mobsters]] and all manner of miscreants to funnel kickbacks and bribes to friends, family members, business associates and even themselves."&lt;ref&gt;William K. Rashbaum, [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/21/nyregion/edward-mangano-wife-food-taster.html Once Again, a No-Show Job Plays a Role in a New York Graft Case], ''New York Times'' (October 20, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philip Carlo]], in his biography of [[Anthony "Gaspipe" Casso]], writes that no-show jobs are "a classic [[American Mafia|Mafia]] setup" and that such positions were highly prized among mobsters.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Carlo, ''Gaspipe: Confessions of a Mafia Boss'' (HarperCollins, 2008), p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2012 report of the [[Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor]] found that "no-show jobs held by relatives of mobsters and other well-connected people continue to vex government officials trying to make the ports more efficient and more competitive."&lt;ref&gt;Patrick McGeehan, [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/22/nyregion/no-show-jobs-taint-new-york-harbor-waterfront-commission-says.html No-Show Jobs and Overstaffing Hurt New York Harbor, a Report Says], ''New York Times'' (March 21, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past, no-show jobs were also an aspect of corruption in [[Boston]]&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence S. DiCara with Chris Black, ''Turmoil and Transition in Boston: A Political Memoir from the Busing Era'' (Hamilton Books, 2013), p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;Melvin G. Holli, "The Daley Era: Richard J. to Richard M." in ''The Mayors: The Chicago Political Tradition: The Chicago Political Tradition'', 3d ed. (eds. Paul M. Green &amp; Melvin G. Holli: [[Southern Illinois University Press]], 2005), p. 230.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Corporate fraud ==

In the corporate world, "no-show" employees&amp;mdash;also called ghost employees&amp;mdash;usually have some family or personal relationship to a supervisor. In the corporate world, this is considered a type of [[payroll]] fraud. Fraud [[audit]]s seek to detect such practices.&lt;ref&gt;Sunder Gee, ''Fraud and Fraud Detection: A Data Analytics Approach'' (John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2015), pp. 173-74.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leonard W. Vona, ''The Fraud Audit: Responding to the Risk of Fraud in Core Business Systems'' (John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2011), pp. 214-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nowhere''' is a [[Burning Man]] regional Event in Spain. It is the biggest regional gathering in Europe. It is held annually in July in the [[Monegros Desert]], located in [[Aragon]] in north-eastern Spain.

Nowhere, like any Burning Man event, differs drastically from a common [[music festival]]. Participation is the key element of the event and every attendant is expected to be involved in some way. Everyone is regarded as a participant. Every task ranging from setup over maintaining the gate and perimeter up to first aid are volunteer based. There is no hired workforce aside from transport and logistics. Further, there are no scheduled performers or stages. Every participant is expected to contribute something to the event. Participants pay everything they contribute out of their own pocket as there is a strict rule of non commerce during the whole event.

As an official regional Event Nowhere embraces the Burning Man principles.

==Similarities and differences to Burning Man==
Nowhere's size, cultural background and geographical location produces quite a different event from Burning Man. Given it is Europes biggest burn event it attracts a very international crowd including people from overseas.

Unlike Burning Man, Nowhere doesn't include fire as a key feature of the event.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goingnowhere.org/en/blog/46-blogentry/326-nowhere-the-no-burn-burn Nowhere - The No-Burn Burn]. Goingnowhere.org&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the dry area, which is on wildfire alert during the summer, it is strictly forbidden to have any kind open fire, therefore no Art is set on fire. Fire spinning is restricted to a controlled area with fire marshals on duty. The burning of an effigy happened only once in 2016 after coming to an agreement with the local authorities. Nowhere uses a Lighthouse as their effigy and a [[Compass]] as its logo.

===Layout===
Like Burning Man Nowhere is created solely by the participants and driven by theme camps which are called ''Barrios''. During the last incarnations Nowhere used a layout that reassembled a compass. This leads to an arrangement of the Barrios in a circle like shape, in opposition to Burning Mans half round layout. Nowhere further divides the camps in three distinct sound zones reading from the ''green zone'' which has a no sound policy to the ''red zone'' which hosts the dance camps. The same goes for the free camping areas. There is no open space or ''deep playa'' at Nowhere.

===Art===
Art is the core of any burn event and Nowhere do not differ from this. Despite this large scale artworks in the dimension of Burning Man are rare at Nowhere. This is in part due to the strict non burning policy. The logistics of transport, setup, takedown and removal are more challenging to the participants because of this. Nowhere gives art grants for artists up to €3000.&lt;ref name="art grant"&gt;[https://www.goingnowhere.org/en/artandinnovation/artgrant Art Grant: Aims &amp; Guidelines]. Goingnowhere.org&lt;/ref&gt; Artworks that are meant to be build on the playa require a prior registration.

===Public infrastructure===
The event has a central shade structure known as ''Middle of Nowhere (MoN)''. As the name suggests she is placed prominently in the middle of the playa. It is a public space for relaxing, dancing, workshops and socializing. In difference to Burning Man there is no coffee sold there and commerce is limited to ice only. Other public infrastructure includes: ''NoInfo'' which serves as the general point of information, ''La Cantina'' which offers volunteers a free meal and ''Werkhaus'', which sets up and keeps the public infrastructure intact.

===Long drops===
Until 2017 Nowhere provided a special setup to avoid or limit the use of [[chemical toilet]]s called ''Long Drops''.&lt;ref name="long drop"&gt;[https://www.goingnowhere.org/en/generalinfo/toilets General Info on the Long Drops from 2015]. Goingnowhere.org&lt;/ref&gt; These were deep drilled holes which were covered by an open air toilet seat. Participants covered their feces down in the hole with some loose soil after using the Long Drops. These units were serviced by volunteers known as ''Shit Ninjas''. As the event has grown the use of the Long Drops was declined. Nowhere has since experimented with other alternative ways of human waste management. The Shit Ninjas have taken over the servicing of the chemical toilets and provide a very clean toilet setup compared to most other events.

==Landscape==
The landscape in the region of [[Monegros]] near [[Zaragoza]] is very dry and has a desert-like feel. Some canyons around Nowhere resemble the desert in Nevada. There is a lot of agriculture close to the Nowhere location, but it depends heavily on a well-developed irrigation system with water from the Pyrenees.
 
==History==
[[File:From mountain nowhere 2009 3 small cropped.jpg|thumb|Nowhere in 2009]]
The roots of Nowhere track back 2002, when UK burners started to organize a [[decompression party]] in London.&lt;ref name="dave"&gt;[http://fabelabs.com/nowhere/ Email Posting by David Bradshaw]&lt;/ref&gt; Nowhere began in 2004, in [[Bardenas Reales]], and has roughly doubled in size each year, to the current size of around 4000 participants in 2018. Nowhere has been held in several different locations in the Navarra and Aragon regions of Spain. The current location is near [[Sariñena]] in the [[Province of Huesca]].

===Origin of the name===
In 2004, at the first Nowhere event, there was a public board to suggest names for the event. Out of it came the formalization of the name '''Nowhere'''. According to Bongo Pedro, the first mention of the name Nowhere occurred in a thread discussing names for the event. Armand wrote that he couldn't wait to meet us all in the "middle of nowhere". Three people liked the idea of Nowhere as a name and none of the other ideas got more than one vote each.

It was suggested the name came from a sign showing ''Welcome to Nowhere'' outside the only store and gas station in [[Empire, Nevada]],&lt;ref name="nowhere_origin"&gt;[http://www.goingnowhere.org/en/forums.html?func=view&amp;catid=6&amp;id=1484#1618 Forum entry about Nowhere name origin]. Goingnowhere.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="empire"&gt;[http://cache.virtualtourist.com/1302596-Empire_Store_Deli-Empire.jpg Photo of the Nowhere Sign in Empire, Nevada]&lt;/ref&gt; the second-to-last town on the way to [[Burning Man]]; it consists only of a few houses and is literally in the middle of Nowhere, the Nevada desert.

==Principles==
Nowhere is built on the following key principles, they are inspired by Burning Man, however they have been adapted and re-edited in an inverted order:

# '''Self-expression''' - The freedom to be yourself: Be the person you are. Be the person you want to be. We respect and value you, and expect the same from you. You have the freedom to be yourself. Become who you are.
# '''Self-reliance''' - You are responsible for you, mentally and physically: From food and water to a hug or quiet, you need to take care of yourself in Nowhere’s challenging environment. Give yourself what you need – and ask others for help when you need it.
# '''No commerce''' - Forget about money – there’s nothing to buy: By removing commerce from our community, we create co-operation and participation. We plan ahead and work together. We live without money to remind us of what’s really important.
# '''Leave no trace''' - From dust to dust, we leave only footprints: We care for the environment, and we take care of our home. We clean up after ourselves; we leave nothing behind; we leave no trace we were there. From dust to dust, we leave only footprints.
# '''Participation''' Get involved – Nowhere is what we make it: The more you do, the more you get back. When you join others in play and in work, you are part of Nowhere. Your contribution is more valuable than you realise.
# '''Inclusion''' - Everyone is welcome to be a Nobody: We welcome everyone for their unique contribution to our community. Include others as you want to be included, with respect, consideration and tolerance.
# '''Gifting''' - We give our time, effort and gifts freely: We give to help others and because it makes us feel good. From a cold beer to digging out a tent pole to a small badge, our gifts are from our heart.
# '''Co-operation''' - Together we are stronger: From how we work together to how we communicate, co-operation is at Nowhere’s core. If we can make life easier, we will. If we can make life better, we will. Together we are stronger.
# '''Community''' - A family of individuals, we look after each other. A diverse group of separate self-reliant beings, we are united in our need to be part of something larger than ourselves. Community, others, self – united by tolerance and joy.
# '''Immediacy''' - Make now count: Be now here, be nowhere. Make now count. All this will soon be gone, so enjoy now. Experience, participate, be. This is all there is, so enjoy it!"

==Barrios==
A Barrio is a group of people who camp together, have a common infrastructure (kitchen, shade structure etc.) and typically provide a certain service or attraction for the other participants. Barrios have to register with the event and get a placement regarding their size and sound zone preferences.

Barrios are a vital part of Nowhere and in 2018 the event hosted about 50 Barrios ranging from large sound camps to meditation camps. There are special Barrios like Werkhaus, which houses core event volunteers. They range widely in size from less than ten to over a hundred members. Due to the international nature of the event, Barrios can take on a national character, with a majority of members from a certain country. Other Barrios are very international in their demography. Some Barrios have a history of 10 or more years of contributing to the event.

Each year, Norg - Nowhere board of organizers - awards the Prize of "Best Barrio of the Playa", based on various criteria as general look, respect of the principles, animations, communication with the other Barrios and installations provided. In 2017 and 2018, Ran'Dome, a Belgian-French camp with food, drinks and loud sound as main themes (as well as a certain fetishism around randomness and dices), received the prize, after a heavily disputed contest with their all-time challengers, Übertown.

== Freecampers ==
Aside from the Barrios there are many zones for independent campers that are not affiliated with a Barrio called free camps. Most participants of Nowhere stay in there. They are often referenced as ''Freecampers''. Some Freecampers build shade structures and artworks all on their own in these zones. Others organize public spaces within the free camping areas. One of the most famous is ''Middle of Frickin Freecamp'' (MOFF). MOFF offers the possibility to hold gatherings and workshops and has become a stable at Nowhere during the last years.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6075">The '''OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises''' are an annex to the [[OECD]] Declaration on International Investment and Multinational Enterprises. They are recommendations providing principles and standards for responsible business conduct for [[multinational corporations]] operating in or from countries adhering to the Declaration. The Guidelines are legally nonbinding, but the OECD Investment Committee and its Working Party on Responsible Business Conduct encourage implementation among adherents. Originally, the Declaration and the Guidelines were adopted by the OECD in 1976. The Guidelines were subsequently revised in 1979, 1982, 1984, 1991, 2000 and 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oecd.org/investment/guidelinesformultinationalenterprises/2011update.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic elements==
The Guidelines cover [[business ethics]] on a range of issues, including:
*[[employment]] and industrial relations
*[[human rights]]
*[[Natural environment|environment]]
*information disclosure
*combating [[bribery]]
*[[consumer]] interests
*science and technology
*[[competition]]
*[[taxation]]
In addition, the OECD has developed specific guidance in a number of sectors to help enterprises implement the Guidelines and proactively identify risks of adverse impacts. These sectors include extractives, mineral supply chains, agricultural supply chains, garment supply chains, and the financial sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/sectors/|title=Sectors - Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|website=mneguidelines.oecd.org|language=en|access-date=2017-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The work of the National Contact Points in support of this is called the "proactive agenda."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/proactiveagenda.htm|title=Guidelines for MNEs - Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|website=mneguidelines.oecd.org|language=en|access-date=2017-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Institutions==

===National Contact Points===
According to the OECD Council decision each adhering country has to set up a National Contact Point (NCP), an entity responsible for the promotion of the Guidelines on a national level. It handles all enquiries and matters related to the Guidelines in that specific country, including investigating complaints (referred to as "specific instances"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/specificinstances.htm|title=Guidelines for MNEs - Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|website=mneguidelines.oecd.org|language=en|access-date=2017-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;) about a company operating in, or headquartered in that country. Some are based in a relevant government department; some are independent structures comprising government officials, trade unions, employers unions and sometimes non-governmental organisations. In order to improve their functioning and coherence across adherent countries, the NCPs established a peer review schedule in 2016 that plans 4-6 reviews annually.

===OECD Investment Committee===
The OECD Investment Committee is the primary body responsible for overseeing the functioning of the Guidelines and implementation of all OECD investment instruments. The Committee consists of member states' senior officials from treasuries, economics, trade and industry, and foreign affairs ministries and central banks. All OECD member states are members of the Investment Committee. Argentina and Brazil are observers and the 13 non-Members that have subscribed to the Declaration participate in the work of the Committee on issues related to the Guidelines.  A Working Party on Responsible Business Conduct was established in 2013 as a subsidiary body of the Investment Committee to help implement the Guidelines and strengthen the system of National Contact Points.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://webnet.oecd.org/OECDGROUPS/Bodies/ShowBodyView.aspx?BodyID=7597&amp;BodyPID=10516&amp;Lang=en&amp;Book=True|title=On-Line Guide to OECD Intergovernmental Activity|website=webnet.oecd.org|access-date=2017-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Operation Enduring Freedom – Horn of Africa''' ('''OEF-HOA''') is the United States [[military operation]] to combat militant [[Islamism]] and [[piracy]] in the [[Horn of Africa]].&lt;ref name=EUCOM-OPERATIONS-AND-INITIATIVES/&gt; It is one component of [[Operation Enduring Freedom]] (OEF), which includes eight African states stretching from the far northeast of the continent to the oil-rich [[Gulf of Guinea]] in the west.&lt;ref name="Afwudlsos"&gt;{{cite web|last=Rozoff|first=Rick|title=AFRICOM's First War: U.S. Directs Large-Scale Offensive In Somalia|url=http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article24996.htm|publisher=Information Clearing House|accessdate=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other OEF mission in Africa is known as [[Operation Enduring Freedom – Trans Sahara]] (OEF-TS), which, until the creation of the new [[United States Africa Command]], was run from the [[United States European Command]].&lt;ref name=EUCOM-OPERATIONS-AND-INITIATIVES&gt;{{cite web|title=EUCOM: Operations and Initiatives|url=http://www.eucom.mil/english/Operations/main.asp|publisher=United States European Command|accessdate=6 February 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070109185740/http://www.eucom.mil/english/Operations/main.asp &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 9 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Combined Joint Task Force – Horn of Africa]] (CJTF-HOA) is the primary (but not sole) military component assigned to accomplish the objectives of the mission. The naval component is the multinational [[Combined Task Force 150]] (CTF-150) which operates under the direction of the [[United States Fifth Fleet]]. Both of these organizations have been historically part of [[United States Central Command]]. In February 2007, [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[George W. Bush]] announced the establishment of the United States Africa Command which took over all of the area of operations of CJTF-HOA in October 2008.&lt;ref name=DOD-ESTABLISHING-US-AFRICA-COMMAND&gt;{{cite news|title=DoD Establishing U.S. Africa Command|url=http://www.defenselink.mil/News/NewsArticle.aspx?id=2940|publisher=[[United States Department of Defense]]|date=6 February 2007|accessdate=6 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=africom-stands-up&gt;{{cite news | title= Africans Fear Hidden U.S. Agenda in New Approach to Africom | url= http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,430564,00.html | agency= Associated Press | date= 30 September 2008 | accessdate=30 September 2008 | publisher= Fox News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CJTF-HOA consists of about 2,000 servicemen and women from the United States military and allied countries. The official [[area of responsibility]] comprises Sudan, Somalia, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Seychelles and Kenya. Outside this Combined Joint Operating Area, the CJTF-HOA has operations in Mauritius, Comoros, Liberia, Rwanda, Uganda and Tanzania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.africom.mil/getArticle.asp?art=3967&amp;lang=0 |title=CJTF-HOA Factsheet |publisher=Hoa.africom.mil |accessdate=26 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916154416/http://www.africom.mil/getArticle.asp?art=3967&amp;lang=0 |archivedate=16 September 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The American contribution to the operation, aside from advisers, supplies, and other forms of non-combat support, consists mainly of drone strikes targeted at [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|Al-Shabaab]]. These are estimated to have killed roughly 400 militants as well as 3 to 10 civilians.&lt;ref name="thebureauinvestigates.com"&gt;[https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/category/projects/drones/drones-graphs/ "The Bureau of Investigative Journalism"], Somalia Datasheet.

==Operations==

===Interception of missiles from North Korea===
[[File:Asalto al So Sang.jpg|175px|thumb|left|''So San'' Assault.]]
On 9 December 2002 Spanish frigate [[SPS Navarra (F85)|SPS ''Navarra'' (F85)]] intercepted the unflagged freighter ''So San'' several hundred miles southeast of Yemen at the request of the United States government. The frigate fired across ''So San''{{'}}s bow after the freighter ignored hails and attempted to evade the frigate. The freighter's crew was North Korean; 23 containers containing 15 complete [[Scud]] ballistic missiles, 15 high-explosive warheads, and 23 [[nitric acid]] (used as an [[Liquid-propellant rocket|oxidizer for fueling]] Scud missiles) containers were found on board. Yemen claimed ownership of the shipment and protested the interception and U.S. officials released the vessel after receiving assurances that the missiles would not be transferred to a third party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2569687.stm |work=BBC News | title=Scud affair draws US apology | date=12 December 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://edition.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/asiapcf/east/12/11/us.missile.ship/ | title = U.S. lets Scud ship sail to Yemen |publisher=CNN |date=12 December 2002 |accessdate=20 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-piracy operations===
{{further|Combined Task Force 150|Operation Ocean Shield}}
Pirates are rampant along the coast of [[Piracy in Somalia|Somalia]] and present a hazard to all shipping there; as such, anti-piracy operations are a routine part of Operation Enduring Freedom: Horn of Africa. This is done primarily by the [[Combined Task Force 150]] and in parallel to other independent anti-piracy operations conducted off the coast of Somalia by other countries such as China, India and Russia.

====2005====
{{refimprove section|date=February 2012}}
The U.S. Coast Guard Cutter [[USCGC Munro (WHEC-724)|USCGC ''Munro'' (WHEC-724)]], working with carrier {{HMS|Invincible|R05|6}} and the destroyer {{HMS|Nottingham|D91|6}} in the Gulf of Aden, intercepted a hijacked vessel at around noon on 17 March. The interception was ordered after Commander, U.S. Naval Forces Central Command (COMUSNAVCENT) received telephone reports from the [[International Maritime Bureau]]'s Piracy Reporting Center in [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Malaysia]], concerning the hijacking of the Thai-flagged fishing boat ''Sirichai Nava 12'' by three Somalis on the evening of 16 March, as well as a fax indicating that the hijackers demanded U.S. $800,000 in ransom for the vessel's crew.

Commander, Combined Task Force (CTF) 150 tasked ''Invincible'', ''Nottingham'' and ''Munro'' to investigate the situation. A Visit, Board, Search and Seizure (VBSS) team from ''Munro'' boarded ''Sirichai Nava'', while a boarding team from ''Nottingham'' went on to a second fishing vessel, ''Ekhwat Patana'', which was with the Thai vessel. ''Munro''{{'}}s boarding team detained the Somalis without incident.

One of the crew members of the Thai vessel had a minor flesh wound, which was treated by the ''Munro'' boarding team. The Coast Guardsmen also discovered four automatic weapons in the pilothouse, expended ammunition shells on the deck of the vessel, as well as ammunition on the detained suspects. The three suspects were transferred to ''Munro''. The ''Munro'' was assigned to CTF 150, which is the Coalition maritime task force conducting Maritime Security Operations (MSO) in the vicinity of the Horn of Africa, Gulf of Aden, Red Sea, North Arabian Sea and the Gulf of Oman.

====2006====
On 21 January 2006, {{USS|Winston S. Churchill|DDG-81|6}}, an [[Arleigh Burke class destroyer|''Arleigh Burke''-class]] destroyer, captured a vessel operating off the Somali coast whose crew were suspected of piracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Suspected Pirates Captured Off Somali Coast|url=http://www.centcom.mil/sites/uscentcom2/Lists/Current%20Press%20Releases/DispForm.aspx?ID=2596|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080510215431/http://www2.centcom.mil/sites/uscentcom2/Lists/Current%20Press%20Releases/DispForm.aspx?ID=2596|dead-url=yes|archive-date=10 May 2008|publisher=[[United States Central Command]]|date=22 January 2007|accessdate=3 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 March 2006, {{USS|Cape St. George|CG-71|6}}, a [[Ticonderoga class cruiser|''Ticonderoga''-class]] cruiser and {{USS|Gonzalez|DDG-66|6}}, an [[Arleigh Burke class destroyer|''Arleigh Burke''-class]] destroyer, [[Action of 18 March 2006|engaged pirate vessels]] after receiving fire from them.

====2007====
On 3 June 2007, {{USS|Carter Hall|LSD-50|6}}, a [[landing ship dock]], [[Action of 3 June 2007|engaged]] pirates attacking a freighter, but failed to repel them.

On 28 October 2007, the destroyer {{USS|Porter|DDG-78|6}}, [[Action of 28 October 2007|opened fire]] on pirates who had captured a freighter and with other vessels blockaded a port the pirates attempted to take refuge in.

On 16 May, {{USS|Stephen W. Groves|FFG-29|6}} exchanged fire with ''Jih Chun Tsai 68'', a known pirate mothership.

The Danish Navy vessel, HDMS ''Esbern Snare'' exchanged fire with a hijacked boat, killing 4 pirates on 17 May. A boarding team subsequently captured 24 injured pirates and freed 16 hostages.&lt;ref name="Press Statement"/&gt;

On 11 September, a Spanish Navy patrol boat engaged Somali pirates, freeing a French hostage after sinking the pirate skiff and capturing 7 pirates.&lt;ref name="Reuters Africa"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://af.reuters.com/article/somaliaNews/idAFL5E7KB0J620110911 | title=French Hostage Rescued from Pirates after Gunfight | publisher=Reuters Africa | date=11 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The woman was taken hostage after pirates killed her husband and left her catamaran off the coast of Yemen.&lt;ref name="Reuters Africa"/&gt;

On 11 October, [[Royal Marines]] embarked on board {{ship|RFA|Fort Victoria|A387|6}} freed 23 crew members of a hijacked Italian cargo ship after it had been captured by pirates 5 days earlier.

Acting on intelligence from other counter-piracy forces, {{USS|Carney|DDG-64|6}} boarded the Indian-flagged [[dhow]], ''Al Qashmi'' on 6 January. By the time the search team boarded, all evidence of potential piracy had been disposed of, though the crew said they were hijacked by the 9 pirates on board from a different vessel. The 9 suspected pirates were disarmed and given sufficient fuel and provisions to return to Somalia.&lt;ref name="News Release"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.manw.nato.int/pdf/Press%20Releases%202012/Ocean%20Shield/OOS%202012%2001.pdf | title=NATO Task Force Neutralizes Two Pirate Mother Ships | publisher=NATO | date=8 January 2012 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120825205916/http://www.manw.nato.int/pdf/Press%20Releases%202012/Ocean%20Shield/OOS%202012%2001.pdf | archivedate=25 August 2012 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next day, the Danish warship {{Ship|HDMS|Absalon|L16|6}} intercepted an Iranian-flagged dhow after identifying it as a potential pirate mother ship. Warning shots had to be fired before a search team boarded. In addition to the crew of 5 Iranian and 9 Pakistani nationals, the team seized 25 pirates. The captured pirates were then taken aboard ''Absalon'' to determine whether they should be prosecuted.&lt;ref name="News Release"/&gt;

A third pirate vessel was intercepted on 13 January. RFA ''Fort Victoria'' fired off warning shots to stop the vessel and then launched a boarding party. The pirates surrendered without incident and search uncovered several [[RPGs]] and automatic weapons. Royal Marines held the pirates for further investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.manw.nato.int/pdf/Press%20Releases%202012/Ocean%20Shield/OOS%202012%2002.pdf | title=NATO Warship Disrupts Another Pirate Ship | publisher=NATO | date=13 January 2012 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120608013948/http://www.manw.nato.int/pdf/Press%20Releases%202012/Ocean%20Shield/OOS%202012%2002.pdf | archivedate=8 June 2012 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 11, pirates attacked Hong Kong registered tanker ''Island Splendor'' and attacked a Spanish fishing vessel 3 days later. Suspected to have been carried out by the same group of pirates, they were tracked down by RFA ''Fort Victoria'', supported by {{HMAS|Melbourne|FFG 05|6}}, {{Ship|ROKS|Wang Geon|DDH-978|6}}, European Union flagship {{HNLMS|Johan de Witt|L801|6}}, and a Seychelles-based maritime patrol aircraft from Luxembourg.

===Escalating tensions in Somalia===
{{main |Rise of the Islamic Courts Union (2006)}}
On 1 July 2006, a web-posted message purportedly written by [[Osama bin Laden]] urged Somalis to build an Islamic state in the country and warned western states that his [[al-Qaeda]] network would fight against them if they intervened there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Bin Laden releases Web message on Iraq, Somalia|url= https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2006-07-01-bin-laden-plans-message_x.htm |work=USA Today |date=1 July 2007|accessdate=3 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 July 2006, the [[Islamic Courts Union]] (ICU) took control of the Somali capital [[Mogadishu]], and by the beginning of December had firm control of most of the south of Somalia. In November 2006, a United States Marine detachment was in the town of [[Garissa]] in Kenya's [[North Eastern Province (Kenya)|North Eastern Province]], adjoining Somalia. Officially, the Marines were an engineering detachment conducting a humanitarian mission of drilling bore holes in conjunction with the Kenya military to support flood relief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Brett|last=Hart|title=CJTF-HOA to Support Kenyan Government Flood Relief Operations|url=http://www.hoa.centcom.mil/Stories/Dec06/20061205-001.html|publisher=[[Combined Joint Task Force – Horn of Africa]]|date=5 December 2007|accessdate=3 November 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927005927/http://www.hoa.centcom.mil/Stories/Dec06/20061205-001.html|archivedate=27 September 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, locals speculated that the Marines were performing a reconnaissance mission close to the Somali border.&lt;ref name = SUSPICION-AS-MARINES-HIT-TOWN&gt;{{Citation | url = http://allafrica.com/stories/200611170008.html | title = Suspicion As U.S. Marines Hit Town | newspaper = The East African Standard | date = Nov 17, 2006 | publisher = All Africa}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = MARINES-MISSION-MYSTERY&gt;{{Citation | url = http://allafrica.com/stories/200612041176.html | title = Marines Mission Shrouded in Mystery | newspaper = The East African Standard | date = Dec 4, 2006 | publisher = All Africa}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 November 2006, the U.S. Embassy in Kenya issued a travel alert to U.S. citizens regarding travel to Kenya or Ethiopia after letters allegedly written by the Somalian leader of the Islamic Courts Union (ICU), Sheik [[Hassan Dahir Aweys]], encouraged suicide attacks on U.S. citizens in those two countries.&lt;ref name=WHY-US-IMPOSED-TRAVEL-CURB&gt;{{Citation | url = http://allafrica.com/stories/200611260111.html | title = Why U.S. Imposed Travel Curb | newspaper = The Nation | date = Nov 26, 2006 | publisher = All Africa}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 December 2006, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported analysts in [[Nairobi]], Kenya claimed U.S. surveillance aircraft were funneling information to Ethiopian forces.

On 21 January the capture of U.S. troops was reported by the ICU's Qaadisiya.com site, as well as the death of one due to [[malaria]], but this assertion was denied as "utterly bogus" by [[Michael Ranneberger]], U.S. Envoy to Kenya and Somalia.&lt;ref name=US-HAS-GROUND-TROOPS-IN-SOUTHERN-SOMALIA&gt;{{cite news | title = U.S. has ground troops in southern Somalia: Journalist | url = http://www.garoweonline.com/stories/publish/article_7183.shtml | date = 21 January 2007 | publisher = [[Garowe Online]] | accessdate =29 February 2007 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 January, the U.S. admitted to have made a second airstrike, but did not confirm the exact date or location of the strike.&lt;ref name=US-SECOND-AIRSTRIKE&gt;{{cite news | title = Military Official Reports Second US Air Strike in Somalia | url = http://voanews.com/english/2007-01-24-voa67.cfm | publisher = [[Voice of America]] | date = 24 January 2007 | accessdate =6 February 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070215044053/http://voanews.com/english/2007-01-24-voa67.cfm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 15 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 February 2007, the captured ICU leader [[Sharif Ahmed]] was released from Kenyan police authorities.&lt;ref name= SOMALI-ISLAMIST-LEADER-RELEASED-FROM-KENYAN-AUTHORITIES&gt;{{cite news | title = Somali Islamist leader out of Kenyan custody | url = http://www.hiiraan.com/news2/2007/feb/somali_islamist_leader_out_of_kenyan_custody.aspx | date = 1 February 2007 | accessdate =1 February 2007 | agency = Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also was reported to have met with [[Michael Ranneberger]] allegedly to arrange for the release of the captured U.S. troops.&lt;ref name=US-DIPLOMAT-BIDS-THE-RELEASE-OF-11-US-SOLDIERS-SEIZED-IN-SOMALIA&gt;{{cite news | title = US diplomat bids the release of 11 US soldiers seized in Somalia | url = http://www.shabelle.net/news/ne2220.htm | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070203092455/http://www.shabelle.net/news/ne2220.htm | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 3 February 2007 | date = 1 February 2007 | publisher = [[Shabelle Media Network]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 8 February, Sheikh Sharif Sheik Ahmed had gone to Yemen where other ICU members are also thought to have gone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Somali Islamist travels to Yemen |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6342527.stm |date= 8 February 2007 |accessdate=8 February 2007 |publisher=BBC }}&lt;/ref&gt; On that day, reports in the Yememi Arabic newspaper ''Al-nedaa'' stated Sharif Ahmed's release was the first conditional step to arrange the release of varying reports of 11 or 15 United States Marines allegedly captured during fighting in southern Somalia at the [[Battle of Ras Kamboni]].

United States involvement in the conflict continued through 2008 with airstrikes targeting suspected Al Qaeda affiliated militants including a strike of dubious success conducted on 2 March 2008 where at least one U.S. naval vessel launched cruise missiles against an Al Qaeda target in a [[Attack on Dobley|strike on the village of Dobley]] and a successful strike on [[Dhusamareb airstrike|Dhusamareb]] which killed several militant leaders

===Alleged operations in Somaliland===
On 6 May 2005, a [[United States Marine Corps]] unit reportedly landed in Somaliland, the autonomous and self-declared state in northern Somalia. The landings were purportedly conducted to carry out searches, as well as to question locals regarding the whereabouts of terrorist suspects. United States military officials denied the allegations and said operations were not being conducted in Somaliland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=US denies Somali terror landing|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4517971.stm|publisher=BBC News |date=6 May 2007|accessdate=3 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Spirit West Coast''' ('''SWC''') is a [[Christian music festival]] that features Christian artists from several different genres. It also features lectures, workshops in tents, kids' shows, petting zoos, and comedians.

Spirit West Coast was founded by five families in 1995. It began in 1997 as a yearly festival in [[Monterey, California]]. Later, an additional festival in [[Del Mar, California]] was added. These two festivals are held every summer. The festivals are members of the [[Christian Festival Association]].

Many of the most popular Christian acts play concerts for the attendees. These include [[Michael W. Smith]], [[Audio Adrenaline]], [[Newsboys]], [[Delirious?]], [[Chris Tomlin]], [[Tree63]], [[Jeremy Camp]], [[Armour Under Fire]], [[Rebecca St. James]], [[Skillet (band)|Skillet]], [[The Kry]], [[Toby Mac]], [[Jars of Clay]], and many others.

Some of the top Christian speakers and authors give lectures/sermons at Spirit West Coast festivals. Past speakers include [[Charles Stanley]], [[Greg Laurie]], [[Luis Palau]], [[Tony Campolo]], [[Frank Peretti]], [[Miles McPherson]], [[Ron Luce]], and [[Louie Giglio]].

[[Compassion International]] is one of the focuses of SWC. Compassion has a tent where they encourage people to sponsor hungry and needy children in other countries. SWC keeps track of the number of sponsorships and announces the growing number over their loudspeaker.

The layout of Spirit West Coast consists of a main stage with large screens for those that have to stand or sit far away. In addition, it features side stages (some inside tents), several merchandise tents, and various other tents (e.g. first aid, lost and found, etc.). There are also numerous food vendors on site.

SWC offers camping to those that don't live nearby and to those that don't want to stay in hotels. Buses run from the campgrounds to the main stage, so people don't have to walk too far. These buses generally run until about midnight.

Many church groups attend Spirit West Coast. They pack their youth groups into buses and drive to Monterey or Del Mar. SWC offers a special rate for groups. One group calling themselves the "Traveling Circus" has made particularly visible appearances at the concert every year, starting large dance pits at performances. The group is made of a dozen or so Christian punks, goths and hippies.

These festivals last between 3–4 days. They start around 9am and end around midnight each night. People of all faiths (and no faith) can and do attend. There are invitational messages to repent and trust in [[Jesus]], presented both by the event staff and the individual musicians, and there are also [[baptism]]s held at the Monterey festival.

Spirit West Coast is run almost entirely by volunteers. Volunteers typically work four- or nine-hour shifts. Some, namely IT, electrical, construction, kitchen crews, operations, navigators, and a few others, work MANY more hours. For these individuals, SWC is an adventure and family reunion that they look forward to year after year. For these departments, and many others, onsite work often begins a week prior to the festival start date and doesn't end for days after when the last items are packed up and stored for the following year. There is much to be done to convert the Del Mar Fairgrounds into a festival site, and even more to be done to convert the dust bowl of [[Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca]].

'''Teatro San Samuele''' was an [[opera house]] and theatre located at the [[Rio del Duca]], between [[Campo San Samuele]] and [[Campo Santo Stefano]], in Venice. One of several important theatres built in that city by the [[Grimani]] family, the theatre opened in 1656 and operated continuously until a fire destroyed the theatre in 1747. A new structure was built and opened in 1748, but financial difficulties forced the theatre to close and be sold in 1770. The theatre remained active until 1807 when it was shut down by [[Napoleon]]ic decree. It reopened in 1815 and was later acquired by impresario [[Giuseppe Camploy]] in 1819. In 1853 the theatre was renamed the '''Teatro Camploy'''. Upon Camploy's death in 1889, the theatre was bequeathed to the City of Verona. The Venice City Council in turn bought the theatre and demolished it in 1894.

==History==
One of the most important Venetian theatres of the 17th and 18th centuries, the Teatro San Samuele was constructed in 1656 through a commission made by the [[Grimani]] family a year earlier. Initially the theatre was used primarily for [[play (theatre)|plays]] but in the 18th century the house became more closely associated with [[opera]] and [[ballet]]. The famous playwright and librettist [[Carlo Goldoni]] notably served as the theatre's director from 1737–1741, and many of his works were premiered at the theatre during his career.&lt;ref name="Venice"&gt;Nicola Mangini. ''I teatri di Venezia'', Mursia, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The original Teatro San Samuele was destroyed by fire on the last night of September 1747.&lt;ref&gt;Eleanor Selfridge-Field ''A new chronology of Venetian opera and related genres, 1660-1760'' p465&lt;/ref&gt; A new theatre was built in almost identical design and opened in May 1748 as opulent competition for the [[Teatro San Giovanni Grisostomo]]. The new theatre became associated with the [[opera buffa]] repertoire, as the Grimani family preferred to stage [[opera seria]] and other more dramatic works at their other theatre, the [[Teatro San Benedetto]] (built 1755).&lt;ref name="Venice"/&gt; 

At the end of the 18th century the Teatro San Samuele lost much of its former prestige. In 1770 the Grimani family had been forced to sell the theatre due to the economic crisis that hit the Venetian aristocracy.&lt;ref name="Venice"/&gt; The theatre continued to operate until 6 April 1807 when it was ordered closed by a [[Napoleon]]ic decree which also shut down the [[Teatro San Cassiano]], the [[Teatro San Angelo]], and the [[Teatro San Luca]]. The San Samuele and the San Luca were re-opened after a 21 April 1815 Austrian decree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Almanacco|match=Teatro San Samuele}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1819 the Teatro San Samuele was acquired by [[impresario]] [[Giuseppe Camploy]]. With the exception of the 1840s when performances were sporadic, the theatre remained continuously active until Camploy's death in 1889. In 1853 the theatre was renamed as the Teatro Camploy.  In the third edition of  Murray's ''Hand-book for travellers in northern Italy'' (1847) Sir [[Francis Palgrave]] reported "It is a pretty theatre well adapted for hearing. Opera buffas are performed here" &lt;ref&gt;''Hand-book for travellers in northern Italy'' [by sir F. Palgrave?]. Murray - Page 362 1847&lt;/ref&gt; In his will, Camploy bequeathed the theatre to the City of Verona. The Venice City Council bought it and, after demolishing the theatre in 1894, built the A. Scarsellini elementary school on the former site of the theatre.&lt;ref name="Venice"/&gt;

The '''Teatro de la Zarzuela''' is a theatre in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]]. The theatre is today mainly devoted to [[zarzuela]] (the Spanish traditional musical theatre genre), as well as [[operetta]] and [[recitals]].&lt;ref name="history"&gt;[http://teatrodelazarzuela.mcu.es/en/quienes-somos/historia ''A theatre for a genre... History of the Teatro de la Zarzuela'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.timeout.com/madrid/music/venue/13687/teatro-de-la-zarzuela Teatro de la Zarzuela - Timeout Madrid] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090908165115/http://www.timeout.com/madrid/music/venue/13687/teatro-de-la-zarzuela |date=2009-09-08 }}''&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The theatre was designed by architect [[Jerónimo de la Gándara]] and built by [[José María Sánchez Guallart]] on the initiative of the Spanish Lyrical Company to provide a space for performances of operettas in the Spanish capital. It was modelled on the [[La Scala]] theatre in [[Milan]] with its three-level horseshoe form and opened to the public on 10 October 1856, the birthday of [[Isabella II of Spain|Queen Isabella II]]. The name refers to zarzuela, a theatre form that alternates spoken and sung scenes. Its promoters were established masters of the genre such as [[Francisco Asenjo Barbieri]], Rafael Calleja Gómez, [[Joaquín Gaztambide]], [[Rafael Hernando]], [[José Inzenga]], [[baritono]] Francisco de Salas, librettist [[Luis de Olona]] and composer [[Cristóbal Oudrid]], under Francisco de las Rivas, an important banker.

In the second half of the nineteenth century, Teatro de la Zarzuela became Madrid's leading opera house, staging many of the great masterworks. On November 9, 1909 the building was virtually destroyed by fire. The rebuild by Cesareo Iradier reduced the amount of wood and metal, and in 1914 Maestro Luna raised the curtain with his orchestra to reopen the theatre. With the [[Teatro Real]] opera house closed from 1925 to 1997, Teatro de la Zarzuela remained Madrid's leading venue throughout the period and hosted most major opera events.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; The theatre's resident ensemble is the [[Community of Madrid Orchestra]].

The ceiling originally featured magnificent works by the painters [[Francisco Hernández Tomé]] and Manuel Castellanos, but these were destroyed in renovations and structural changes that were made in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mfxgGNCV62IC&amp;pg=PA408|page=408 |title=Anthem Guide to the Opera, Concert Halls and Classical Music Venues of Europe|first=Steven|last=Isserlis|publisher=Anthem Press |year=2009|ISBN=1843312727}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theatre then was acquired by the Sociedad General de Autores de España, although much of the facade and interior ornamentation was lost. Later it became the property of the state. In 1984 the Ministry of Culture, with Madrid still lacking an opera house, expanded the range of activities beyond zarzuela and opera to encompass flamenco and other dance. The building was given heritage status in 1994, and in 1998 was again remodelled, restoring much of the original structure and form.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

'''USinternetworking, Inc.''' (USi) was an [[application service provider]]. It offered outsourced business applications delivered over the Internet or a private network connection for an installation charge and a flat monthly fee. In October 2006, it was acquired by [[AT&amp;T]].

==History==
The company was founded in January 1998 by [[Christopher R. McCleary]], Chris Poelma and Stephen McManus

Early investors included Grotech&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A43495-2005Jan2.html | title=Grotech Hopes to Repeat Success of Long John Silver's | first=Terence | last=O'Hara | work=[[The Washington Post]] | date=January 3, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[US West]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bizjournals.com/baltimore/stories/1999/01/25/story1.html | title=USi to raise $86M in IPO | first=William | last=Glanz | work=[[American City Business Journals]] | date=January 25, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1998, the company pursued a merger with [[PSINet]] but was rejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB888183544836286000 | title=USinternetworking Won't Pursue Its Proposed Acquisition of PSINet | work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] | date=February 23, 1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1998, the company signed a lease for its 24,000 square foot office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bizjournals.com/baltimore/stories/1998/05/11/story1.html | title='Net exec wired for growth | first=David | last=Harrison | work=[[American City Business Journals]] | date=May 11, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 9, 1999, during the [[dot-com bubble]], the company became a [[public company]] via an [[initial public offering]]. Shares rose 174% on the first day of trading, ending the day at $57.50 per share.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://money.cnn.com/1999/04/09/markets/techwrap/ | title=Nets roll, but Compaq warns | work=[[CNNMoney]] | date=April 9, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.wired.com/1999/04/yet-another-big-ipo-day/ | title=YET ANOTHER BIG IPO DAY | first=CRAIG | last=BICKNELL | work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] | date=April 9, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 26, 1999, the company was named the first certified [[Broadvision]] application service provider.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=USinternetworking is named the first certified Broadvision Application Service Provider | url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/usinternetworking-is-named-the-first-certified-broadvision-application-service-provider-74210787.html | publisher=[[PR Newswire]] | date=April 26, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1999, the company announced an agreement to develop [[Microsoft Office 2000]] as an online service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.marketwatch.com/story/usinternetworking-shares-rise-on-news-of-microsoft-deal | title=USinternetworking shares rise on news of Microsoft deal | work=[[Marketwatch]] | date=November 12, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2000, founder Christopher R. McCleary resigned as [[chief executive officer]] of the company and was replaced with Andrew Stern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/2000/07/25/founder-steps-down-as-chief-executive-of-usinternetworking/3fe13434-1d74-42c6-b13a-ad079bfd73dc/ | title=Founder Steps Down As Chief Executive of USinternetworking | first=Yuki | last=Noguchi | work=[[The Washington Post]] | date=July 25, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By July 2001, after the bursting of the dot-com bubble, shares were trading for $1 each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://money.cnn.com/2001/07/10/markets/hotstox/index.htm | title=Hot Stocks: Deep discount | work=[[CNNMoney]] | date=July 10, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2002, the company filed [[bankruptcy]]. It emerged in May 2002 with financing from [[Bain Capital]] and a merger with Interpath.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/2002/05/22/usinternetworking-out-of-bankruptcy/3cabf60a-3d0a-43e7-bc35-0cccecfab422/ | title=USinternetworking Out of Bankruptcy | first=Yuki | last=Noguchi | work=[[The Washington Post]] | date=May 22, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.crn.com/news/channel-programs/18828409/usi-merges-with-interpath-emerges-from-bankruptcy.htm | title=USi Merges With Interpath; Emerges From Bankruptcy | first=Christina | last=Torode | work=[[CRN (magazine)|CRN]] | date=May 22, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2003, Stephen A. Mucchetti was named [[chief operating officer]] of the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/2003/09/03/former-ibm-executive-to-join-usinternetworking/bc5e00f1-d41e-4a6a-955f-64e54286330f/ | title=Former IBM Executive To Join USinternetworking | first=Yuki | last=Noguchi | work=[[The Washington Post]] | date=September 3, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5514">The '''Web 2.0 Summit''' (originally known as the '''Web 2.0 Conference''') was an annual event, held in [[San Francisco]], [[California]] from 2004 to 2011, that featured discussions about the [[World Wide Web]]. The event was started by [[Tim O'Reilly]], who is also widely credited with popularizing the term "[[Web 2.0]]". It was organized by O'Reilly's company, [[O'Reilly Media]], with O'Reilly and journalist/entrepreneur [[John Battelle]] serving as co-moderators. The Web 2.0 Summit was an invitation-only event and featured many of the most prominent entrepreneurs and thinkers of the web community.

Spin-off events included the Web 2.0 Expo, which lasted from 2007 to 2011,&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.web2expo.com/2011/12/a-long-goodbye-to-web-2-0-expo/ A Long Goodbye to Web 2.0 Expo], Kaitlin Pike, ''Web 2.0 Expo Blog'', December 1, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Gov 2.0 Summit]], which occurred in 2009 and 2010.

==After 2011==
The Web 2.0 Summit conference was not held in 2012 because co-organizer John Battelle lacked the time to help organize it while working on the book he was writing.

The '''World Wide Day of Genital Autonomy''' (WWDOGA) is a campaign day to [[Circumcision controversies|oppose circumcision of infants]] initiated by the German "Facharbeitskreis Beschneidungsbetroffener im MOGiS e.V.". Since 2013, it is celebrated on each 7 May in many countries and regarded by the press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article122864783/Tag-der-genitalen-Selbstbestimmung-geplant.html|title=Beschneidungsgegner: Tag der "genitalen Selbstbestimmung" geplant|website=DIE WELT}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.domradio.de/themen/menschenrechte/2016-05-07/vierter-jahrestag-des-koelner-beschneidungs-urteils|title=Vierter Jahrestag des Kölner Beschneidungs-Urteils - domradio.de|website=www.domradio.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.frauenrechte.de/online/index.php/themen-und-aktionen/weibliche-genitalverstuemmelung2/aktuelles/archiv/1185-erster-qworldwide-day-of-genital-autonomyq-75|title=Erster "Worldwide Day of Genital Autonomy"|website=[[Terre des Femmes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/to-cut-or-not-to-cut-the-never-ending-debate-around-circumcision/a-38745320|title=To cut, or not to cut?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8071">The '''Youth Internet Safety Survey''' was a series of two surveys conducted in the United States in 1999 and 2004.   The National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children (NCMEC) provided funding to Dr. [[David Finkelhor]], Director of the Crimes Against Children Research Center at the [[University of New Hampshire]], to conduct a research survey in 1999 on Internet victimization of youth. His research was cited by the [[United States Department of Justice]] as "the best profile of this problem to date".

Crimes Against Children Research Center staff interviewed a nationally representative sample youth, aged 10 to 17, who used the Internet regularly.  There were 1501 subjects in the first survey in 1999, and 1500 in the second survey in 2005.

Results from the surveys have been quoted in support of the [[Deleting Online Predators Act of 2006]], saying that "one in five children had received an unwanted online solicitation of a sexual nature".  This is a reference to the 19% found in the first survey (see "First Survey" below).  This is potentially misleading, since some have interpreted this as implying adults soliciting offline sexual contact from children.  The 19% includes solicitation from minors to minors, and are not generally requests for physical/"offline" contact.  The same survey found that none of the solicitations led to an actual sexual contact or assault.

The more complete results and recommendations are included below.

==Definitions==
'''Internet user:''' using the Internet at least once a month for the past six months at home, school, a library, or some other place.

'''Sexual solicitations and approaches:''' Requests to engage in sexual activities or sexual talk or give personal sexual information that were unwanted or, whether wanted or not, made by an adult.  Note that this includes solicitation from other minors, so unwanted advances by a 13-year-old on a 14-year-old are included in this.

'''Aggressive sexual solicitation:''' Sexual solicitations involving offline contact with the perpetrator through regular mail, by telephone, or in person or attempts or requests for offline contact.

'''Unwanted exposure to sexual material:''' Without seeking or expecting sexual material, being exposed to pictures of naked people or people having sex when doing online searches, surfing the web, opening E-mail or instant messages, or opening links in E-mail or instant messages.

'''Harassment:''' Threats or other offensive behavior (not sexual solicitation), sent online to the youth or posted online about the youth for others to see.

Not all such incidents were distressing to the youth who experienced them. Distressing incidents were episodes where youth rated themselves as very or extremely upset or afraid as a result of the incident.

==First Survey (1999)==
Known as YISS-1.  This was conducted between August 1999 and February 2000.  It interviewed 1501 youth Internet users, ages 10 through 17.

===Highlights of Results===

Regarding "Sexual Solicitations and Approaches", the survey found:
* 19 percent of the young Internet users surveyed received an unwanted sexual solicitation in the past year.
* 5 percent of the surveyed youth received a distressing sexual solicitation (i.e., the solicitation made them feel very or extremely upset or afraid).
* 3 percent of the youth received an aggressive solicitation involving offline contact or attempts or requests for offline contact.
* None of the solicitations led to an actual sexual contact or assault.

One-third of the surveyed youth who had received a solicitation were male; two-thirds were female. The great majority (77 percent) of the victims were 14 to 17 years old; however, almost one quarter were ages 10 to 13. The younger group reported 37 percent of the distressing solicitations.

Regarding "Unwanted Exposure to Sexual Material", the survey found:
* 25 percent of the surveyed youth reported unwanted exposures to sexual material.
* 6 percent of the youth had experienced distressing exposures (i.e., the exposure made them very or extremely upset).

A slightly higher percentage of boys than girls reported exposures (57 percent vs. 42 percent) or distressing exposures (55 percent vs. 45 percent). Almost two-thirds of exposures were to youth ages 15 to 17. Less than one-tenth were to 11- and 12-year-olds, and none to 10-year-olds.

Regarding harassment, the survey found:
* Six percent of the young people surveyed reported harassment incidents (threats, rumors, or other offensive behavior) during the past year.
* Two percent of the surveyed youth reported episodes of distressing harassment (i.e., the incident made them feel very or extremely upset or afraid).

==Second Survey (2004)==
Known as YISS-2.  This was conducted between March and June 2005.  It interviewed 1500 youth Internet users, ages 10 through 17.

===Highlights of Results===

Regarding "Sexual Solicitations and Approaches", the survey found:
* 13 percent of the young Internet users surveyed received an unwanted sexual solicitation in the past year.  This is a decrease from the 19 percent found in the prior survey.
* 4 percent of the surveyed youth received a distressing sexual solicitation (i.e., the solicitation made them feel very or extremely upset or afraid). This is approximately the same as the 5 percent found in the prior survey.
* 4 percent of the youth received an aggressive solicitation involving offline contact or attempts or requests for offline contact.  This is approximately the same as the 3 percent found in the prior survey.
* Two of the solicitations (0.1 percent) lead to sexual assault, compared to zero cases of sexual contact or assault in the prior survey.  For comparison, according to the FBI's criminal victimization tables' national rate for sexual assault, one would expect 4 rapes or sexual assaults every year in a group of youth this size.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/abstract/cvusst.htm Bureau of Justice Statistics Criminal Victimization in the United States - Statistical Tables&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060827051942/http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/abstract/cvusst.htm |date=August 27, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 


Regarding "Unwanted Exposure to Sexual Material", the survey found:
* 34 percent of the surveyed youth reported unwanted exposures to sexual material.  This is a marked increase from the 25% found in the prior survey.
* 9 percent of the youth had experienced distressing exposures (i.e., the exposure made them very or extremely upset).  This is a rough equal increase from the 6% found in the prior survey.  The study attributed this rise in part to aggressive tactics by pornography marketers, and the increased speed and capacity of computers and Internet connections to transmit images.

Regarding harassment, the survey found:
* 9 percent of the young people surveyed reported harassment incidents (threats, rumors, or other offensive behavior).  This is a marked increase from the 6% found in the prior survey.  Study authors said it was consistent with growing indicators of online incivility among youth.
* 3 percent of the surveyed youth reported episodes of distressing harassment (i.e., the incident made them feel very or extremely upset or afraid).  This is a roughly equal increase from the 2% found in the prior survey.
