'''Access to public information''' and '''[[freedom of information]]''' ('''FOI''') refer to the right to access information held by public bodies also known as "right to know". Access to public information is considered of fundamental importance for the effective functioning of democratic systems, as it enhances governments' and public officials' accountability, boosting people participation and allowing their informed participation into public life. The fundamental premise of the right to access public information is that the information held by governmental institutions is in principle public and may be concealed only on the basis of legitimate reasons which should be detailed in the law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/freedom-of-expression/freedom-of-information Freedom of Information, UNESCO. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-16}}]&lt;/ref&gt; Access to public information builds on the principle that in a democratic system people should be in the condition of accessing a wide range of information in order to effectively participate in public life as well as on matters affecting them.

The right of access to public information is a component of the fundamental right of [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]] set forth by Article 19 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (1948) which states that the fundamental right of freedom of expression encompasses the freedom "to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers". Access to public information and freedom of information are recognised as human rights in the three main regional systems of human rights, namely within the Americas, Europe and Africa, as well as in major international instruments.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.article19.org/resources.php/resource/3024/en/international-standards:-right-to-information ARTICLE 19, The Public's Right to Know. Principles on Freedom of Information Legislation, 05 April 2012. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-19}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

The right to access information places two obligations on public bodies. First, the proactive duty  to make public key information on the activities of authorities and governments; second, the reactive obligation to respond to  people's requests for information, either by releasing public original documents or copies of the documents held.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legalleaks.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Legal_Leaks_English_International_Version.pdf Access-Info and n-ost (edited by), LegalLeaks - Toolkit.

Over the past 10 years, the right to information and access to public information has been recognised in an increasing number of countries and several [[Freedom of information laws by country|FOI laws]] have been adopted all over the world, including in the developing countries. If in 1990 only 13 countries had a national freedom of information law, today there are 100 such laws across the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/freedom-of-expression/freedom-of-information/ UNESCO.{{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-16}}]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.access-info.org/frontpage/26216 Access-Info Europe, Statement by European RTI Community on the world's First Official Access to Information Day, 28 September 2016. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-18}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 The [[UNESCO]] General Conference voted to designate Sept. 28 as "International Day for the Universal Access to Information" or, as it is more commonly known, [[Access to Information Day]]. The date had previously been celebrated as "Right to Know Day" since 2002.  The UNESCO resolution recommends approval by the [[UN General Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.freedominfo.org/2015/11/unesco-names-sept-28-access-to-information-day/|title=UNESCO Names Sept. 28 Access to Information Day|last=|first=|date=17 November 2015|publisher=freedominfo.org|access-date=11 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
{{See also|Freedom of information}}
{{See also|Freedom of information laws by country}}

The right to access information builds on the principle that the public has a right to know how power is exercised and public money is spent, given that public bodies are elected by people and sustained by taxpayers. The access to public information is a precondition  for governments' and public officials' accountability and it enables the adoption of informed decisions by citizens, hence representing a fundamental element for the proper functioning of democratic systems. International standards and evolving jurisprudence have confirmed that information held by public bodies belong to the public.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.access-info.org/what-is-the-right-to-know Access-Info Europe, What is the right to know?{{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-17}}]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Council of Europe Convention on Access to Official Documents]] (2009) states that "all official documents are in principle public and can be withheld subject only to the protection of other rights and legitimate interests".&lt;ref&gt;[https://rm.coe.int/CoERMPublicCommonSearchServices/DisplayDCTMContent?documentId=0900001680084826 Council of Europe, Council of Europe Convention on Access to Official Documents. Council of Europe Treaty Series - No. 205, 2009.{{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-17}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

More than 100 countries around the world have now adopted national [[Freedom of information laws by country|access to information laws]] to make the right to know effective. The first law on access to public information was adopted in [[Sweden]] in 1766, but after that one should wait almost one century to have the second law approved in [[Finland]] in 1951 and in the [[United States]] in 1966. During the 1970s and 1980s there has been a small but constant growth in FOI's laws, with a real expansion after 1989 due to the activism of civil society groups in [[Central and Eastern Europe]] during the post-Communist transitions to democracy. Indeed, the big push forward in the field of access to information leading to the broadening of the definition and of the scope of the right of access to information came together with a coordinated civil society reaction to contrast the control over the information exercised by Communist regimes in the [[Eastern Bloc|Soviet bloc]]. It was this movement which gave a sound contribution to the development of access to information as a right in the sense of a human right. A 1992 decision of the Hungary's Constitutional Court established that access to information is a "fundamental right" essential for citizen oversight on the lawfulness and efficiency of the government.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.access-info.org/wp-content/uploads/CriticalPerspectivesonRightofAccesstoInfo_HelenDarbishire.pdf Helen Darbishire, "Ten Challenges for the Right to Information in the Era of Mega-Leaks"] in Tarlach McGonagle and Yvonne Donders (edited by), The United Nations and Freedom of Expression and Information. Critical perspectives, June 2015, {{ISBN|9781107083868}} {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, environmentalist groups and consumer associations also contributed to the affirmation of the right to know.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessinitiative.org/sites/default/files/companies_and_the_right_to_access_public_information.pdf Associación por los Derechos Civiles; Instituto del Banco Mundial; Inter-American Investment Corporation, 2007, Companies and the right to access public information. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-24}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

All the eight former communists countries which joined the [[Enlargement of the European Union|European Union in 2004]] had a freedom of information law; also [[Romania]] and [[Bulgaria]] had their own law when joined the EU in 2007 and [[Croatia]] had already had an access to information law in force for ten years when it joined the EU in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.access-info.org/wp-content/uploads/CriticalPerspectivesonRightofAccesstoInfo_HelenDarbishire.pdf Helen Darbishire, June 2015. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-20}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

Nowadays, in the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]] region 48 of the 56 member states have specific access to information laws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legalleaks.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Legal_Leaks_English_International_Version.pdf Access-Info and n-ost (edited by), June 2014.{{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-17}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

The right to access information places two obligations on governments and public bodies. First, the duty to make public key information on the activities implemented by public bodies; second, the obligation to respond to people's requests of accessing documents, either by making available the original documents or by sharing copies of documents and information held.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legalleaks.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Legal_Leaks_English_International_Version.pdf Access-Info and n-ost (edited by), June 2014.{{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-17}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

Access to information is a right which comprises two parts. The first is a proactive component, namely the positive obligation of public bodies to provide, make public and disseminate information about their activities, budgets and policies so that citizens can understand what public bodies are doing, can participate in public life and can monitor the behaviour of public authorities. The second component is a reactive one, entailing the right of all persons to requests information and documents to public bodies, along with the right to receive an answer. In principle, all the main information held by public bodies should be available, while exceptions to disclosure should be grounded on the protection of other values, such as privacy, national security or commercial interests.

On the occasion of the first officially recognised [[Access to Information Day]] celebrated on 28 September 2016, European civil society groups working to enhance the right of access to public information raised some concerns as, despite significant progress, there are still far-reaching shortcomings especially with regard to transparency of decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.access-info.org/frontpage/26216 Access-Info Europe, 28 September 2016. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-18}}]&lt;/ref&gt; According to such organisations, among the main obstacles to government openness there is the inadequate record keeping of public bodies’ information: minutes of public officials’ meetings are not recorded, exchange with lobbyists are not available, public decisions are adopted without proper justification or documented evidence available to the public.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.access-info.org/frontpage/26216 Access-Info Europe, 28 September 2016. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-18}}]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.access-info.org/decision-making-transparency Access-Info Europe, Opening up decision-making. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-18}}]&lt;/ref&gt; An additional problem concerns the over-application of exceptions with particular regard to the use of the privacy reasons, applied to not disclose the activities of public officials when performing public functions. Moreover, European civil society organisations are particularly concerned for the lack of transparency around the decision-making process at both national and EU level, as in the case of the refusal by the EU to disclose documents on the [[EU-Turkey refugee deal]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.access-info.org/frontpage/26216 Access-Info Europe, 28 September 2016. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-18}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Access to information as a human right==

A big push forward the advancement of the right to access information as a fundamental right was due to the activism of civil society movements which contrasted the regimes' control over information in the Communist countries in the Soviet bloc. A fundamental document in this sense is a 1992's decision of the Hungarian Constitutional Court which established that access to information is a "fundamental right" essential for citizen oversight on the lawfulness and efficiency of the government.&lt;ref&gt;See Decision 32/1992 (V.29) AB, 183-84 (as translated by the Office of the Hungarian Parliamentary Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information)&lt;/ref&gt;

Progressively, several national and international courts decisions have been treating access to information as a basic human right, thus providing a strong legal case for citizens resorting to courts to defend any refusals by authorities to provide access to public information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legalleaks.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Legal_Leaks_English_International_Version.pdf Access-Info and n-ost (edited by), June 2014. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-17}}]&lt;/ref&gt; Such decisions are grounded on a series of international declarations, human rights covenants and conventions at international, regional and EU levels. In the first place, the right to access public information is recognised as a fundamental right and as a component of the right of freedom of expression in the Article 19 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]; in the Article 19 of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights]]; and in the Article 13 of the [[American Convention on Human Rights]]. At regional level, all the three main regional systems of human rights, namely within the Americas, Europe and Africa, have recognised freedom of information as a universal human right.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.article19.org/resources.php/resource/3024/en/international-standards:-right-to-information ARTICLE 19, 05 April 2012. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-19}}]&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2011, the [[United Nations Human Rights Committee]] confirmed that the right to freedom of expression enshrined in Article 19 of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] includes the right of access public information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legalleaks.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Legal_Leaks_English_International_Version.pdf Access-Info and n-ost (edited by), June 2014. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-17}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the European Union level, Article 42 of the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union|European Charter of Fundamental Rights]] establishes the right of access to EU institutions documents, as recognised also by Article 15 of the [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union|Treaty on the Functioning of the EU]] ("Treaty of Lisbon"). In 2009, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] on the basis of Article 10 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], which is the article on [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]], acknowledged the fundamental right of access to information held by public bodies. Specifically, the Court established that the right to information is protected in particular in case of "[[information monopoly]]", namely when the public bodies are the only ones owning the requested information, and when the information is needed by media or civil society organisations for public accountability purposes. The decision of the European Court embraced a 2006 decision by the [[Inter-American Court of Human Rights]] which endorsed Article 13 of the [[American Convention on Human Rights|American Human Rights convention]] stating that individuals have the right to request information to public authorities and public authorities have the positive obligation to provide such information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legalleaks.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Legal_Leaks_English_International_Version.pdf Access-Info and n-ost (edited by), June 2014. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-17}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, many countries across the world recognise the right to information or access to documents in their [[Constitution]]s, either within the frame of the right to freedom of expression or separately and specifically as the right of access to information or documents. At least 50 countries all over the world, including 29 [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]] countries, have Constitutions including such provisions .&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legalleaks.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Legal_Leaks_English_International_Version.pdf Access-Info and n-ost (edited by), June 2014. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-17}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Societal benefits of access to public information: accountability, participation, efficiency==
[[Transparency (behavior)|Transparency]] enhanced through the right to access public information entails a series of core benefits for democratic societies, in particular [[accountability]], [[Participation (decision making)|participation]] and efficiency. First, access to public information enhances public accountability as it contributes to make governments and public officials more accountable for their actions and decisions. Second, the right to know boost people participation as it makes available information that can help citizens to make more effective decisions on matters that directly affect their lives and to participate with informed opinions in public debates and in the decision-making process. Third, access to public  information contributes to the efficiency of decision-making as disclosure encourages public institutions to better manage and organise information and may help to improve communication between public bodies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legalleaks.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Legal_Leaks_English_International_Version.pdf Access-Info and n-ost (edited by), June 2014. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-17}}]&lt;/ref&gt; Also, access to information serve some other social goals. For instance, access to medical records can help individuals to improve personal decision-making and make better decisions about medical treatment, financial planning and the like. Finally, access to information can facilitate effective business practices as some of the information held by public bodies related to economic issues can be very useful for enterprises and can therefore contribute to increasing the effectiveness of the business sector.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.article19.org/resources.php/resource/3024/en/international-standards:-right-to-information ARTICLE 19, International 7standards: Right to information. 05 April 2012. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-19}}]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessinitiative.org/sites/default/files/companies_and_the_right_to_access_public_information.pdf Associación por los Derechos Civiles; Instituto del Banco Mundial; Inter-American Investment Corporation, 2007. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-24}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

==International standards and laws==
At national level access to public information is regulated by [[Freedom of information laws by country|freedom of information laws]]. In addition to national legislation, principles and standards for access to public information are set forth into several international declarations and treaties that have authoritatively recognised the fundamental and legal nature of the right to freedom of information along with the need for effective legislations that should guarantee the respect of that right in practice.&lt;ref&gt;.[https://www.article19.org/resources.php/resource/3024/en/international-standards:-right-to-information ARTICLE 19, 05 April 2012. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-19}}]&lt;/ref&gt; Such international laws and standards include:

* '''Civil society standards and declarations''': these include the Ten Principles on the Right to Know by the Justice Initiative (2005); the Public's Right to Know - Principles on Freedom of Information Legislation by Article 19 (1999); the Atlanta Declaration and Plan of Action for the Advancement of the Right of Access to Information (2008); the Budapest Declaration on Right of Access to Information (2008); the Transparency Charter for International Financial Institutions: Claiming our Right to Know by the Global Transparency Initiative (2006); the Declaration on Parliamentary Openness (2012);
* '''International treaties''': these include the [[Council of Europe Convention on Access to Documents]] (2009) and the [[Aarhus Convention]] on Access to Information, Public Participation and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters (1999);
* '''Inter-governmental Principles and Recommendations''': these include the Principles on the Right of Access to Information by the [[Organization of American States|Organisation of American States]] (2000); the [[Council of Europe]] Recommendation 2002(2) on access to official documents (2002); the Declaration of Principles on Freedom of Expression in Africa by the [[African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights|African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights]] (2002); the [[UNESCO]]'s Maputo Declaration on Fostering Freedom of Expression, Access to Information and Empowerment of People (2008); the [[UNESCO]]'s Brisbane Declaration on Freedom of Information; the Dakar Declaration on Media and Good Governance (2005);
* '''Annual reports of the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Opinion and Expression''': the [[United Nations Special Rapporteur|UN Special Rapporteur]] has addressed the issue of freedom of information in its annual reports since 1997. After that, the Commission on Human Rights endorsed the commentaries of the Special Rapporteur and asked him to elaborate further on the right to seek and receive information. As a consequence, the UN Special Rapporteur expanded significantly his commentary on freedom of information in his 2000 annual Reports.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.article19.org/resources.php/resource/3024/en/international-standards:-right-to-information ARTICLE 19, International standards: Right to information. 05 April 2012. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-19}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Access to public information: guiding principles==
The non-governmental organisation [[Article 19|ARTICLE 19]] has published a set of principles called "The Public's Right To Know: Principles on Freedom of Information Legislation" which describes the best practices and standards on freedom of information legislation based on international and regional laws as well as on evolving national practices and legislations. Such principles, which are designed mainly for national laws, are also applicable to inter-governmental bodies such as the [[United Nations]] and the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.article19.org/data/files/pdfs/standards/righttoknow.pdf ARTICLE 19, The Public's Right to Know. Principles on Freedom of Information Legislation, June 1999. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-19}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Principle 1: Maximum disclosure===
The principle of maximum disclosure sets a presumption that all information held by public bodies should be covered by the scope of access to information laws. This presumption accepts only limited circumstances for exceptions. This principle incorporates the very basic rationale underpinning the concept of freedom of information. It entails that public authorities seeking to deny access to public information have the obligation to justifying their refusal. The principle of maximum disclosure provides for a broad definition of "public bodies" which are subject to the duty of releasing information. Such a broad interpretation includes all branches of government, e.g. local governments, elected bodies, nationalised industries and public corporations, judicial bodies and also private bodies carrying out public functions. Principle 1 requires the law to establish minimum standards regarding the maintenance and preservation of documents by public bodies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.article19.org/data/files/pdfs/standards/righttoknow.pdf ARTICLE 19, June 1999. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-19}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Principle 2: Obligation to publish===
This principle implies the obligation for public bodies to respond to access to information requests and to publish and disseminate documents of public interest. Few reasonable limits based, for instance, on resources and capacity can be accepted. As a minimum, public authorities should make public the following types of information:
* operational information on the functioning of public bodies, including objectives, results and costs;
* information on any requests or complaints that people may take in relation of a given public body;
* information on how members of the public may provide their contribution to the policy-making process;
* the types and formats of information held by public bodies;
* information on decisions and policies affecting the public, along with background information on those decisions and the evidence that led to their formulation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.article19.org/data/files/pdfs/standards/righttoknow.pdf ARTICLE 19, June 1999. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-19}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Principle 3: Promotion of open government===
This principle calls governments to actively promote a culture of openness in order to enhance the respect of the right to know. This is important as experiences in different countries have shown that recalcitrant public authorities can undermine the application of even the most progressive legislations. National laws should therefore allocate adequate resources to the promotion of an [[open government]] culture and the goals of FOI laws, including by means of internal codes on access and openness, educational programmes, media coverage and communications campaigns. Such activities should also be aimed at contrasting the culture of official secrecy within government for example through trainings for public officials.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.article19.org/data/files/pdfs/standards/righttoknow.pdf ARTICLE 19, June 1999. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-19}}]&lt;/ref&gt; An important step in this direction has been adopted in 2011 with the establishment of a new global alliance of democratic countries committed to the promotion of transparency, accountability and participation under the label [[Open Government Partnership]] &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.access-info.org/wp-content/uploads/CriticalPerspectivesonRightofAccesstoInfo_HelenDarbishire.pdf Helen Darbishire, June 2015. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-20}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Principle 4: Limited scope of exceptions===
Exceptions to disclosure should be grounded on clearly and narrowly defined exceptions. Public authorities should show that a refusal to provide the required information has passed a test through which to assess if the disclosure of a given information threaten to cause substantial harm to a legitimate aim and if the harm is greater than the public interest in having the information. Non-disclosure decisions should be taken on a case-by-case basis. National laws should provide an exhaustive list of the legitimate reasons that may justify non-disclosure. Such a list should be narrowly defined and include only highly relevant interests to be protected, such as [[law enforcement]], [[privacy]], [[national security]], commercial and other confidentiality, public or individual safety and the integrity of the decision-making process. However, even if can be demonstrated that disclosure would cause substantial harm to a legitimate interest, the information should be released when the benefits of disclosure prevail over the harm. In other words, the harm to the legitimate interest must be weighed against the public interest in having a given information publicly available.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.article19.org/data/files/pdfs/standards/righttoknow.pdf ARTICLE 19, June 1999. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-19}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Principle 5: Processes to facilitate access===
According to this principle requests for public information should be processed quickly and fairly and an independent review of any refusals should be made available to the applicant. Also, public bodies are called to set up open, accessible systems for implementing freedom of information laws and thus ensuring the public's right to receive the required information. Furthermore, the law should establish an individual right to [[appeal]] to an independent body for any refusal by a public body to release information. All members of the public should be in the condition of accessing to appeal procedures without incurring in undue costs and complicated procedures.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.article19.org/data/files/pdfs/standards/righttoknow.pdf ARTICLE 19, June 1999. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-19}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Principle 6: Costs===
This principle states that costs for accessing public information should not be so high as to deter applicants from making the request. Around the world there are different cost regimes, including, for instance, flat fees systems for each request and graduated fees depending on the actual cost of retrieving and reproducing the information and / or the documents requested.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.article19.org/data/files/pdfs/standards/righttoknow.pdf ARTICLE 19, June 1999. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-19}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Principle 7: Open meetings===
Freedom of information comprises the public's right to know how the government behaves on behalf of people and to participate to decision-making. Freedom of information law should thus incorporates the presumption that all relevant meetings of governing bodies, i.e. those involved in decision-making, should be open to the public. Meetings may be closed, but only when sound reasons for closure exist. Such reasons have to be clearly explained and closure have to comply to established procedures.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.article19.org/data/files/pdfs/standards/righttoknow.pdf ARTICLE 19, June 1999. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-19}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Principle 8: Disclosure takes precedence===
Other laws dealing with publicly held information should be consistent with the principle of maximum disclosure and the other principles underpinning freedom of information. In particular, the regime of exceptions  should be clearly defined in the freedom of information legislation; extensions of the exceptions regime should not be allowed by other laws.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.article19.org/data/files/pdfs/standards/righttoknow.pdf ARTICLE 19, June 1999.{{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-17}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Principle 9: Protection for whistleblowers===
[[Whistleblower]]s, i.e. individuals who make publicly available information on government's wrongdoings - including for instance corruption, dishonesty, maladministration, serious threat to health, safety or the environment, etc. - should be protected from any legal, administrative or other kind of sanctions. In this context the public interest refers to situations where the benefit of disclosure prevails over the harm, no matter how the disclosure has been conducted. This applies in particular when there are exceptionally serious reasons for releasing a certain information, such as a serious threat to public health or safety, or when there is a strong evidence that wrongdoing will be concealed or destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.article19.org/data/files/pdfs/standards/righttoknow.pdf ARTICLE 19, June 1999.{{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-19}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Access to public information: main features==

===Universal access===
Being a fundamental and universal right, in principle access to information is a right to everyone: almost all national [[Freedom of information laws by country|freedom of information laws]] recognise this by establishing that "anyone" may make a request to access public information. One noteworthy exception among the world's democracies is [[Canada]] where only citizens and residents are entitled to submit access to information requests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legalleaks.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Legal_Leaks_English_International_Version.pdf Access-Info and n-ost (edited by), June 2014. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-17}}]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, a major practical obstacle to the universal exercise of the right to access information is due to the obligation to submit the requests in the official language of the country which may hamper the exercise of the right to know for people that does not have a command of a country's official language.

In the EU, according to the treaties the right to access documents and the right to appeal to the [[European Ombudsman]] applies only to EU citizens, residents and companies registered inside the EU. While in general anyone whose right has been violated can appeal to the [[European Court of Justice]], in the case of the right to access information the Court is obliged to accept cases made by EU citizens, residents and businesses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legalleaks.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Legal_Leaks_English_International_Version.pdf Access-Info and n-ost (edited by), June 2014. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-17}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kind of information and documents to be made available under access to information laws===
In principle, all information held by public bodies can be accessed upon a FOI's request, unless some exceptions can be applied (e.g. on the ground of protecting state interests; private interests or human rights, or to ensure effective governments). Some national laws refer to "access to information" while others to "access to documents": even if these definitions actually overlap, it can be useful for the applicant to be aware of the exact phrasing used by the law in order to formulate properly the access to information request, and thus, having more chance of success. Usually "documents" and "information" should be made available whatever its medium, e.g. written on paper or in electronic format, or as a sound, visual or audiovisual.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legalleaks.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Legal_Leaks_English_International_Version.pdf Access-Info and n-ost (edited by), June 2014. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-17}}]&lt;/ref&gt; The EU Regulation 1049/2001 specifies that documents subject to access to information are those concerning "policies, activities and decisions falling within the institutions’ sphere of responsibility" and this applies to all documents held by the EU institutions "in all areas of activity of the European Union".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/register/pdf/r1049_en.pdf REGULATION (EC) No 1049/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2001 regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-17}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public bodies concerned by access to information===
In general in Europe the right of access to information applies to all administrative bodies, at any level of government, from central government to local authorities. Some rare exceptions to this can be found, as in the case of [[Ireland]] where police forces are exempted. In addition to administrative bodies, in national legislations which have been progressively approved the obligation to disclose information has been extended also to legislative and judicial bodies. Moreover, in many countries also some private bodies performing public functions or receiving public funds are obliged to respond to access to information requests. For instance, in [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] which adopted an access to information law in 2006, the right to access applies to local and national governments, legislative bodies and judicial authorities, and encompasses also private bodies with public functions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legalleaks.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Legal_Leaks_English_International_Version.pdf Access-Info and n-ost (edited by), June 2014. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-17}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Inter-governmental organisations====
Many inter-governmental bodies hold information about policies and decisions affecting people's lives. While the EU has defined a set of rules regulating access to information held by EU institutions, the debate is still open about whether the right of access information applies to inter-governmental organisations which are outside the scope of national laws and have not signed international human rights conventions. Campaigning organisations have worked for the adoption of internal rules - called "disclosure policies" or "access to information policies" - so that inter-governmental organisations could apply rules similar to national access to information laws. The [[World Bank]] adopted its Access to Information Policy in July 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legalleaks.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Legal_Leaks_English_International_Version.pdf Access-Info and n-ost (edited by), June 2014. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-17}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Standard exceptions to the right to information==
Although in  principles the right of access to information applies to all information held by public bodies, it is not an absolute right as there can be some exceptions not allowing the disclosure of certain kind of information. If released this information can violate some "legitimate interests", disturb public life or undermine other societal values. To justify the withhold of public information, authorities have the burden of the proof, thus have to demonstrate that disclosure would cause harm to a legitimate interest as specified by the law.

International laws and standards in the field of access to public information provide for three categories of standard exceptions. Specifically,

'''Exceptions to protect state interests or international relations''', such as:
* National security and defence of the state;
* International relations;
* Public safety or public order;
* Economic, monetary and exchange rate policies of the state;

'''Exceptions aimed at ensuring effective government''':
* Protection of internal public bodies’ deliberations prior to decision-making (known as "space to think" exception);
* Protection of criminal enquiries;

'''Exceptions to protect private interests and human rights''', such as:
* Privacy and other legitimate private interests;
* Commercial and other economic interests like, for instance, trade secrets;
* The environment;
* Guaranteeing the effective administration of justice and equality of parties before the courts.

However, even if the requested information or documents are sensitive and exceptions apply, some part of it could be released by public bodies on the ground of two factors. The first is the right of partial access according to which authorities have the duty of removing sensitive information and release the rest of the document. The second "exception to exceptions" applies when transparency overrides secrecy, thus even if the information is sensitive the public interest in knowing it is stronger. In this particular case public officials have to apply the so-called "public interest test", meaning that they have to scrutinize and ponder both the exceptions for not releasing information and the reasons of public interest in knowing the information required. Many national access to information laws foresees this kind of test.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legalleaks.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Legal_Leaks_English_International_Version.pdf Access-Info and n-ost (edited by), June 2014. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-17}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Right to appeal==
Applicant have the [[Appeal|right to appeal]] in case of "[[administrative silence]]" (i.e. the request is not answered), when public authorities reject the disclosure request or when their reply is not satisfying and does not meaningfully answer the question. Rules regulating the right to appeal depends on national legislations and vary from country to country. Generally, there are four main appeals mechanisms:

* '''Internal or Administrative Appeal''': internal review is addressed to the same authority that issued the denial or made a non-satisfying disclosure or to the administrative body which is immediately superior;
* '''Administrative or Higher Court Appeal''': appeal to administrative court is usually the step following internal review. This is regulated by administrative law and the competent authority entitled to examine the appeal are regional or national administrative courts. A further appeal to a higher court, including the [[European Court of Human Rights]], is also possible.
* '''Information Commission/er Appeal''': in this case the appeal is scrutinised by a dedicated body whose specific role is to protect the right to access information. Such bodies can issue binding decisions as well as non-binding recommendations, depending on national laws. The decisions of the [[Information commissioner|Information Commissioner]] can always go to appeal. In the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]] region, Information Commissions exist in 16 countries.
* '''Ombudsman Appeal''': in some countries, the [[Ombudsman]] - which is the institution whose role is to protect the rights of citizens vis à vis public authorities - has also the function to examine complains related to access to information. In many cases the Ombudsman's decision is only a recommendation, i.e. a non-binding measure, although usually his/her opinion is taken in due consideration by public authorities. At the EU level, the [[European Ombudsman]] is responsible for processing complaints concerning access to documents.

==Access to public information in practice==

===Request's contents===
Requests for accessing public information to the public authorities covered by the scope of national laws should be as clear and specific as possible about the information or documents required. A well-formulated request will facilitate the work of public officials and will more likely result in a positive answer or at least reducing the reasons for rejecting the request.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legalleaks.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Legal_Leaks_English_International_Version.pdf Access-Info and n-ost (edited by), June 2014. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-17}}]&lt;/ref&gt; Usually the name and address of the person filing the request have to be provided. Giving also the e-mail address as well as a phone number might facilitate the exchange with public officials. In some countries requests made by resorting to pseudonyms or anonymously are permitted.

===Procedure===
In general, the procedure for requesting public information under national laws is simple and does not foresees many formalities. Usually requests can be filed in writing, either by post or hand-delivered to the concerned public authority. In most countries, submission is allowed also by e-mail. Moreover, some access to information laws permit oral requests, made, for instance, by phone or in person. However, in some cases, such as in [[Slovenia]], oral request are not considered to be a formal basis for going to appeal. In some countries, such as in [[Armenia]] or [[Romania]], rules and timeframes for written requests and oral requests are different.

===Fees===
Filing a request for accessing public information should always be free of charge, as confirmed by the [[Council of Europe Convention on Access to Official Documents]] which allows only costs for copying and delivering the documents, such as photocopying, postage costs, or costs of reproduction into other formats or materials in case of DVDs or CDs. As a rule, electronic delivery is free of charge. The majority of countries in the [[Council of Europe]] region comply with this rule, even if there are notable exceptions, such as [[Ireland]] and [[Germany]] where, however, the required fees can be significantly reduced on the ground of public interest.

===Modalities of getting the information===
In reply of a formal request of accessing public information, the examination of the required information can be allowed in different ways, including the inspection of original documents; photocopies sent by post or e-mails; copies in DVDs or CDs.

===Timeframes for getting a reply===
There is a great variability across Europe on the timeframes for public authorities to answer requests as well as for notifying the extension of the timeframe for justified reasons or for issuing a refusal. However, the average time is about 15 working days.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legalleaks.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Legal_Leaks_English_International_Version.pdf Access-Info and n-ost (edited by), June 2014. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-17}}]&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, the countries with the shortest timeframe for response are [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]] (1–3 days). On the contrary, the Albanian and Austrian access to information laws give the authorities a period of respectively 40 and 60 days to respond to people's requests. Most national laws allow the extension of the timeframe in case of requests which are particularly complex. In all cases such extension should be notified to the applicant, along with an explanation of the reasons that led to it. At the EU level, the Regulation 1049/2001 establishes 15 working days for issuing a response; an extension of up 15 additional working days may be applied in exceptional cases, for instance when the request relates to long documents or a large number of documents.

&lt;/ref&gt; on affective haptics and real-time communication system with rich emotional and haptic channels. Driven by the motivation to enhance social interactivity and emotionally immersive experience of users of real-time messaging, virtual, augmented realities, the idea of reinforcing (intensifying) own feelings and reproducing (simulating) the emotions felt by the partner was proposed.
Four basic haptic (tactile) channels governing our emotions can be distinguished: (1) physiological changes (e.g., heart beat rate, body temperature, etc.), (2) physical stimulation (e.g., tickling), (3) social touch (e.g., hug, handshake), (4) emotional haptic design (e.g., shape of device, material, texture).

&lt;/ref&gt; the conscious experience of emotion occurs after the cortex receives signals about changes in physiological state. Researchers argued that feelings are preceded by certain physiological changes. Thus, when we see a venomous snake, we feel fear, because our cortex has received signals about our racing heart, knocking knees, etc. Damasio&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; distinguishes primary and secondary emotions. Both involve changes in bodily states, but the secondary emotions are evoked by thoughts. Recent empirical studies support non-cognitive theories of nature of emotions. It was proven that we can easily evoke our emotions by something as simple as changing facial expression (e.g., smile brings on a feeling of happiness).&lt;ref&gt;

== Sense of touch in affective haptics ==

Human emotions can be easily evoked by different cues, and the sense of touch is one of the most emotionally charged channels. Affective haptic devices produce different senses of touch including kinesthetic and coetaneous channels. Kinesthetic stimulations, which are produced by forces exerted on the body, are sensed by mechanoreceptors in the tendons and muscles. On the other hand, mechanoreceptors in the skin layers are responsible for the perception of cutaneous stimulation. Different types of tactile corpuscles allow us sensing thermal property of the object, pressure, vibration frequency, and stimuli location.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; key feature is that it physically reproduces the human-hug pattern, generating pressure simultaneously on each user’s chest and back. The idea to realistically reproduce hugging is in integration of active-haptic device HaptiHug and pseudo-haptic touch simulated by hugging animation. Thus, high immersion into the physical contact of partners while hugging is achieved.

=== Intimate touch ===
Affection goes further than hugging alone. People in long distance relationships are faced with a lack of physical intimacy on a day-to-day basis. Haptic technology allows for kinesthetic and tactile interface design. The field of digital co-presence envelops Teledildonics as well. The Kiiroo SVir is a good example of an Adult CyberToy that incorporates tactile input, by means of a surface that is touch capacitive, and an inside that is kinesthetic in nature. 12 rings contract, pulse and vibrate according to the movements one's partner makes in real time. The SVir mimics the actual motion of its OPue counterpart and is also compatible with other SVir models.
The SVir enables women to have intercourse with their partner through use of the OPue interactive vibrator no matter how great the distance that separates the couple.

=== Implicit emotion elicitation ===
Different types of devices can be used to produce the physiological changes. Of the bodily organs, the heart plays a particularly important role in our emotional experience. The heart imitator HaptiHeart&lt;ref name="Affective Haptics" /&gt; produces special heartbeat patterns according to emotion to be conveyed or elicited (sadness is associated with slightly intense heartbeat, anger with quick and violent heartbeat, fear with intense heart rate). False heart beat feedback can be directly interpreted as a real heart beat, so it can change the emotional perception. HaptiButterfly&lt;ref name="Affective Haptics" /&gt; reproduces “butterflies in your stomach” (the fluttery or tickling feeling felt by people experiencing love) through arrays of vibration motors attached to the user’s abdomen. HaptiShiver&lt;ref name="Affective Haptics" /&gt; sends “shivers up and down your spine” through a row of vibration motors. HaptiTemper&lt;ref name="Affective Haptics" /&gt; sends “chills up and down your spine” through both cold airflow from a fan and the cold side of a Peltier element. HaptiTemper is also intended for simulation of warmth on the human skin to evoke either pleasant feeling or aggression

=== Explicit emotion elicitation ===
HaptiTickler&lt;ref name="Affective Haptics" /&gt; directly evokes joy by tickling the user’s ribs. It includes four vibration motors reproducing stimuli similar to human finger movements

=== Affective (emotional) haptic design. ===
Recent findings show that attractive things make people feel good, which in turn makes them think more creatively.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of emotional haptic design was proposed.&lt;ref name="Affective Haptics" /&gt; The core idea is to make user to feel an affinity for the device through:
* appealing shapes evoking the desire to touch and haptically explore them,
* material pleasurable to touch, and
* the anticipation of the pleasure of wearing the device.

=== Affective computing ===
[[Affective computing]] can be used to measure and to recognize emotional information in systems and devises employing affective haptics. Emotional information is extracted by using such techniques as speech recognition, natural language processing, facial expression detection, and measurement of physiological data.

== Potential applications ==
[[Image:iFeelIM.png|thumb|400px | The iFeel_IM! architecture]]
Possible applications are as follows:
* treating depression and anxiety (problematic emotional states),
* controlling and modulating moods on the basis of physiological signals,
* affective and collaborative games,
* psychological testing,
* assistive technology and augmentative communication systems for children with autism.
Affective Haptics is in the vanguard of emotional telepresence,&lt;ref&gt;

[[Image:EmoHeart.png|thumb|EmoHeart object on the avatars’ chest vividly and expressively represents the communicated emotions]]
The philosophy behind the iFeel_IM! (intelligent system for Feeling enhancement powered by affect sensitive Instant Messenger) is “I feel [therefore] I am!”. In the iFeel_IM! system, great importance is placed on the automatic sensing of emotions conveyed through textual messages in 3D virtual world Second Life (artificial intelligence), the visualization of the detected emotions by avatars in virtual environment, enhancement of user’s affective state, and reproduction of feeling of social touch (e.g., hug) by means of haptic stimulation in a real world. The control of the conversation is implemented through the Second Life object called EmoHeart&lt;ref&gt;

To produce movie-specific tactile stimuli influencing the viewer’s emotions to the viewer’s body, the wearable tactile jacket was developed by Philips researchers.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Analog observation''' is typically divided into two iteration of application: The first iteration primarily studies the effect of manipulation of variables in the subject's environment, including setting and events, on the subject's behavior.

'''''Arche''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɑr|k|i}}; {{lang-grc|[[:wikt:ἀρχή|ἀρχή]]}}) is a Greek word with primary senses "beginning", "origin" or "source of action". ({{lang|grc|εξ’ ἀρχής}}: from the beginning, οr {{lang|grc|εξ’ ἀρχής λόγος}}: the original argument), and later "first principle" or "element", first so used by [[Anaximander]] (Simplicius in Ph. 150.23). By extension, it may mean  "first place, power", "method of government", "empire, realm", "authorities" (in plural: {{lang|grc|ἀρχαί}}), "command".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aalphabetic+letter%3D*a%3Aentry+group%3D318%3Aentry%3Da%29rxh%2F ἀρχή], ''[[A Greek-English Lexicon]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The first principle or element corresponds to the "ultimate underlying substance" and "ultimate undemonstrable principle".&lt;ref&gt;Peters Lexicon:1967:23&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[philosophical]] language of the [[archaic Greece|archaic period]] (8th to 6th century BC), ''arche'' (or ''archai'') designates the source, origin or root of things that exist.  In [[ancient Greek philosophy]], [[Aristotle]] foregrounded the meaning of ''arche'' as the element or principle of a thing, which although undemonstrable and intangible in itself, provides the conditions of the possibility of that thing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Presocratic Philosophy. Vol 3|author=Barry Sandywell|year=1996|publisher=Routledge New York|url=http://www.books.google.com/books?id=k561uXI-uPgC&amp;printsec }} pp. 142–144&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mythical cosmogonies==
In the mythical [[Greece|Greek]] [[cosmogony]] of [[Hesiod]] (8th to 7th century BC), the origin of the world is [[Chaos (cosmogony)|Chaos]], considered as a divine primordial condition, from which everything else appeared. In the creation "chaos" is a gaping-void, but later the word is used to describe the space between the earth and the sky, after their separation. "Chaos" may mean infinite space, or a formless matter which can be differentiated.&lt;ref&gt;This is described as a large windy-gap, almost unlimited ([[Abyss (religion)|abyss]]) where are the roots and the ends of the earth, sky, sea and [[Tartarus]]: [http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/hesiod/theogony.htm online ''The Theogony of Hesiod'']. Translation H.G.Evelyn White (1914): 116, 736-744&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of temporal infinity was familiar to the Greek mind from remote antiquity in the religious conception of immortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Greek Philosophy|author=William Keith Chambers Guthrie|year=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ogUR3V9wbbIC&amp;pg}} p 83&lt;/ref&gt; The conception of the "divine" as an origin influenced the first Greek philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;The phrase: "Divine is that which had no beginning, neither end" is attributed to [[Thales]]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In the [[Orphic]] cosmogony, the unaging [[Chronos]] produced [[Aether (mythology)|Aether]] and Chaos and made in divine Aether a silvery egg, from which everything else appeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Presocratic Philosophers|author=G.S.Kirk,J.E.Raven and M.Schofield|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|url=http://www.books.google.com/books?id=kFpd86J8PLsC&amp;printsec}} p.24&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mythological cosmogonies of the Near East, the universe is formless and empty and the only existing thing prior to creation was the water abyss. In the [[Babylonia]]n creation story, [[Enuma Elish]] the primordial world is described as a "watery chaos" from which everything else appeared. Something similar is described in [[Book of Genesis]] where the spirit of God is moving upon the dark face of the waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Greek Philosophy|author=William Keith Chambers Guthrie|year=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ogUR3V9wbbIC&amp;pg}} p 58, 59&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Hindu]] cosmology, which is similar to the [[Vedic]] cosmology, in the beginning there was nothing in the Universe but darkness. The self-manifested being created the primordial waters and established his seed into it. This turned into a golden egg ([[Hiranyagarbha]]) from which everything else appeared.&lt;ref&gt;[[Matsya Purana]] (2.25-30)[http://www.bharatadesam.com/spiritual/matsya_purana.php online]; The creation&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Arche'' in Ancient Greek philosophy==
The heritage of Greek [[mythology]] already embodied the desire to articulate reality as a whole and this universalizing impulse was fundamental for the first projects of speculative theorizing. It appears that the order of "being" was first imaginatively visualized before it was abstractly thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Precocratic Philosophy vol.3|author=Barry Sandywell|year=1996|publisher=Routledge New York|url=http://www.books.google.com/books?id=k561uXI-uPgC&amp;printsec }} p.28,42&lt;/ref&gt;
In the ancient [[Greek philosophy]], ''arche'' is the element and the first principle of existing things. This is considered as a permanent substance or nature (physis) either one or more which is conserved in the generation of rest of it. From this all things first come to be and into this they are resolved in a final state. This source of entity is always preserved. ([[Aristotle]]-Metaph.A, 983, b6ff). [[Anaximander]] was the first philosopher that used ''arche'' for that which writers from Aristotle onwards called "the substratum" ([[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius]] Phys. 150, 22).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Greek Philosophy|author=William Keith Chambers Guthrie|year=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ogUR3V9wbbIC&amp;pg }} p 55, 77&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek philosophers ascribed to ''arche'' divine attributes. It is the divine horizon of substance that encompasses and values all things.

[[Thales]] of [[Miletus]] (7th to 6th century BC), the father of philosophy, claimed that the first principle of all things is water,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;DK 7 B1a.&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and considered it as a substance that contains in it motion and change. His theory was supported by the observation of moisture throughout the world and coincided with his theory that the earth floated on water. His ideas were influenced by the Near-Eastern mythological cosmogony and probably by the [[Homeric]] statement that the surrounding [[Oceanus]] (ocean) is the source of all springs and rivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Pre-socratic Philosophers|author=G.S. Kirk, J.E. Raven and M. Schofield|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kFpd86J8PLsC&amp;pg}} p 89, 93, 94&lt;/ref&gt;

Thales' theory was refuted by his successor and esteemed pupil, [[Anaximander]]. Anaximander noted that water could not be the arche, because it could not give rise to its opposite, fire. Anaximander claimed that none of the [[Classical element|elements]] ([[earth]], [[fire]], [[air]], [[water]]) could be arche for the same reason. Instead, he proposed the existence of the [[Apeiron (cosmology)|apeiron]], an indefinite substance from which all things are born and to which all things will return.&lt;ref&gt;Simplicius, ''Comments on Aristotle's Physics'' (24, 13).&lt;DK 12 A9, B1&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; ''Apeiron'' (endless or boundless) is something completely indefinite and Anaximander was probably influenced by the original ''chaos'' of Hesiod (yawning abyss). He probably intended it to mean primarily "indefinite in kind" but assumed it also to be "of unlimited extent and duration".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Pre-socratic Philosophers|author=G.S.Kirk, J.E.Raven and M.Schofield|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kFpd86J8PLsC&amp;pg}} p 110&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of temporal infinity was familiar to the Greek mind from remote antiquity in the religious conception of immortality and Anaximander's description was in terms appropriate to this conception. This ''arche'' is called "eternal and ageless". (Hippolitus I,6,I;DK B2)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Greek Philosophy|author=William Keith Chambers Guthrie|year=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ogUR3V9wbbIC&amp;pg}} p 83&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]], Anaximander's pupil, advanced yet another theory. He returns to the elemental theory, but this time posits air, rather than water, as the arche and ascribes to it divine attributes. He was the first recorded philosopher who provided a theory of change and supported it with observation. Using two contrary processes of [[rarefaction]] and [[condensation]] (thinning or thickening), he explains how air is part of a series of changes. Rarefied air becomes fire, condensed it becomes first wind, then cloud, water, earth, and stone in order.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel.W.Graham.  [http://www.iep.utm.edu/anaximen/ ''The internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Anaximenes''].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Pre-socratic Philosophers|author=C.S.Kirk, J.E.Raven and M.Schofield|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kFpd86J8PLsC&amp;pg}} p 144&lt;/ref&gt; The ''arche'' is technically what underlies all of reality/appearances.

'''''Ars Poetica,''''' or "'''The Art of Poetry'''", is a poem written by [[Horace]] c. 19 [[Before Christ|BC]],&lt;ref&gt;The dating of the poem is uncertain. Different sources give various dates ranging from 19–10 BC. The date 19 BC is given by ''The Oxford Companion to Classical Literature,'' p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; in which he advises poets on the art of writing poetry and drama. The ''Ars Poetica'' has "exercised a great influence in later ages on European literature, notably on French drama"&lt;ref&gt;Howatson, M.C. ''The Oxford Companion to Classical Literature,'' 3rd ed. Oxford University Press, 2013, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; and has inspired poets and authors since it was written.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion of the Ars Poetica and related poems, see: Poets.org – http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/20035&lt;/ref&gt; Although it had been familiar since the [[Middle Ages]], it is used in [[literary criticism]] since the [[Renaissance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cambridge History of Literary Criticism: Volume 3, The Renaissance|last=Norton|first=Glyn|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2001|isbn=0521300088|location=Cambridge, UK|pages=199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The poem was written in [[hexameter]] verse as an Epistle (or Letter) to [[Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus (consul 15 BC)|Lucius Calpurnius Piso]] (the Roman senator and consul) and his two sons, and is sometimes referred to as the ''Epistula Ad Pisones'', or "Epistle to the Pisos". The first mention of its name as the ''"Ars Poetica"'' was c. 95 by the classical literary critic [[Quintilian]] in his ''[[Institutio Oratoria]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''Institutio Oratoria'' 8.60 (Also known as ''Institutes of Oratory'' in its Dedication to Trypho). See: ''Horace: Epistles Book II and Epistle to the Pisones (Ars Poetica),'' ed. by [[Niall Rudd]]. Cambridge University Press, 1990, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; and since then it has been known by that name. The translations of the original epistle are typically in the form of prose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/articles/69381/ars-poetica|title=Ars Poetica by Horace|date=2018-11-23|website=Poetry Foundation|language=en-us|others=Poetry Foundation|access-date=2018-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Written, like Horace's other epistles of this period, in a loose conversational frame, ''Ars poetica'' consists of 476 lines containing nearly 30 maxims for young poets."&lt;ref&gt;Article on ''Ars Poetica.'' Encyclopædia Britannica Academic Edition, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;   But ''Ars Poetica'' is not a systematic treatise of theory, and it wasn't intended to be. It is an inviting and lively poetic letter, composed for friends who appreciate poetic literature.&lt;ref&gt;Horace. Rudd, Niall, editor. ''Horace: Epistles Book II and Ars Poetica''. Cambridge Greek and Latin Classics. Cambridge University Press. (January 26, 1990). {{ISBN|978-0521312929}} page 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Horace approaches poetry from a practical standpoint—as a craft, or ''ars''—rather than the theoretical approach of his predecessors, Aristotle and the philosopher [[Plato]]. He also holds the poet in high regard, as opposed, for instance, to Plato, who distrusts ''[[mimesis]]'' and who has philosopher [[Socrates]] say in Book 10 of the ''Republic'' that he would banish poets from the ideal state.&lt;ref&gt;''The Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism,'' ed. by Vincent B. Leitch et al. New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Co., 2001, p. 121 and p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Summary ==
The following is a brief outline of the main subjects of the work:&lt;ref&gt;This summary is taken from: ''Horace: Satires; Epistles and Ars Poetica,'' translated and edited by H.R. Fairclough. Harvard: Loeb Classical Library, 1926, p. 443.&lt;/ref&gt;

::(a) A poem demands unity, to be secured by harmony and proportion, as well as a wise choice of subject and good [[diction]]. Meter and style must be appropriate to theme and to character. A good model will always be found in Homer (ll, 1–152).
::(b) Dramatic poetry calls for special care – as to character drawing, propriety of representation, length of a play, number of actors, use of the chorus and its music, special features for the satyric type, verse-forms, and employment of Greek models (ll. 153–294).
::(c) A poet's qualifications include common sense, knowledge of character, adherence to high ideals, combination of the ''dulce'' with the ''utile,'' intellectual superiority, appreciation of the noble history and lofty mission of poetry, and above all a willingness to listen to and profit by impartial criticism (ll. 295–476).

:''(For a more detailed summary of Horace's '''Ars Poetica''', see the article on [[Epistles (Horace)|Horace's ''Epistles'']] – Epistle II.3).''

== Literary phrases ==
"Many of...[the] apt phrases [of the Ars Poetica]...have passed into common literary parlance."&lt;ref&gt;Howatson, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;  Four quotations in particular are associated with the work:

* "''[[in medias res]]'' (l. 148)", or "into the middle of things". This describes a narrative technique of starting the story from its middle point. According to Horace, this entices the audience into the plot by making everyone curious about the characters' previous paths and their future destinies. The technique appeared frequently in ancient epics, and remains popular in modern narratives.
* "''[[ab ovo]]'' (l. 147)", or "from the beginning". As Homer did not initiate his epics about the Trojan War from the conception (thus, the egg – "ovo" in Latin) of Helen, poets and other story tellers should do something likewise: in other words, starting a story from its commencement will bore and fatigue audiences that may not be interested in a plot that is tediously inclusive. For another explanation of this mention of an egg, see [[Leda (mythology)]].
* "''quandoque bonus dormitat Homerus'' (l. 359)" or "sometimes even good Homer nods off". Today this expression is used to indicate that 1. even the most skilled poet can make continuity errors and 2. long works, usually epics (such as the [[Iliad]] or the [[Odyssey]]), may have their faults without that detracting significantly from their general quality. In context, however, Horace even censures Homer for such lapses. It reads "et idem | indignor quandoque bonus dormitat Homerus"; (I even castigate the good Homer for the same [fault of technical errors] whenever he nods off). 
* "''[[ut pictura poesis]]'' (l. 361)", or "as is painting so is poetry", by which Horace meant that poetry, in its widest sense meaning "imaginative texts", merits the same careful interpretation that was in his day reserved for painting.

:(The latter two phrases occur one after the other near the end of the poem).

== Key concepts ==
The work is also known for its discussion of the principle of [[decorum]] (the use of appropriate vocabulary and diction in each style of writing) (l.81–106), and for Horace's criticisms of [[purple prose]] ''(purpureus pannus,'' l.15–16), a term coined by him to mean the use of flowery language.&lt;ref&gt;''The Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism,'' p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; This principle is considered a core component of Horatian poetics as it principally aimed to achieve verisimilitude in artistic representation, guiding everything from the choice of genre to diction, dramatic characterization, meter, poetic invention, and the intended effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Poetics of Conduct: Oral Narrative and Moral Being in a South Indian Town|last=Prasad|first=Leela|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2007|isbn=0231139203|location=New York|pages=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some cited that decorum enforces subordination such as of parts to whole, woman to man, desire to reason, and individual to state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Horace: Odes and Epodes|last=Lowrie|first=Michele|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2009|isbn=9780199207695|location=Oxford|pages=160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In line 191, Horace warns against ''[[deus ex machina]]'', the practice of resolving a convoluted plot by having an [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian god]] appear and set things right. Horace writes "Nec deus intersit, nisi dignus vindice nodus": "That a god not intervene, unless a knot show up that be worthy of such an untangler".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.english.emory.edu/DRAMA/ArsPoetica.html Ars Poetica, line 191] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050209203746/http://www.english.emory.edu/DRAMA/ArsPoetica.html |date=February 9, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps it can even be said that the quotability of Horace's ''Ars Poetica'' is what has given it a distinguished place in literary criticism: ''The Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism'' says: 
::It would be impossible to overestimate the importance of Horace's ''Ars Poetica (Art of Poetry)'' for the subsequent history of literary criticism. Since its composition in the first century BCE, this epigrammatic and sometimes enigmatic critical poem has exerted an almost continual influence over poets and literary critics alike – perhaps because its dicta, phrased in verse form, are so eminently quotable. Horace's injunction that poetry should both "instruct and delight" has been repeated so often that it has come to be known as the Horatian platitude.&lt;ref&gt;''The Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism,'' p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Horatian platitude is usually given as "instruct ''and'' delight", but sometimes as "instruct ''or'' delight".  The first reading implies that all literature must be instructive. A related ambiguity is that "instruct" might be better translated as "help", "advise", or "warn". Horace repeats this maxim in different wordings: "Aut prodesse uolunt aut delectare poetae aut simul et iucunda et idonea dicere uitae" (The poet wishes to benefit or please, or to be pleasant and helpful at the same time), "miscuit utile dulci" (a mix of useful and sweet), and "delectando pariterque monendo" (delighting and advising).

The ''Ars Poetica'' was first translated into English in [[1566 in poetry|1566]] by [[Thomas Drant]].&lt;ref&gt;See the article on Thomas Drant by Fred Schurink in ''The Encyclopedia of English Renaissance Literature, Vol.1.'' Blackwell Publishing, 2012, pp.290–292.&lt;/ref&gt; A translation by [[Ben Jonson]] was published posthumously in [[1640 in poetry|1640]].

The '''Australian Drug Evaluation Committee''' or '''ADEC''', was a [[committee]] that provided independent scientific advice to the [[Government of Australia|Australian Government]] regarding therapeutic [[medication|drugs]]. The committee was originally formed in 1963 and more recently authorised under the ''Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 (Cth)'' as part of the [[Therapeutic Goods Administration]] (TGA). In 2010, ADEC was replaced by the [http://www.tga.gov.au/committee/acpm.htm Advisory Committee on Prescription Medicines (ACPM)]

ADEC provided advice to the Minister for Health and Ageing and the Secretary of the Department of Health on:
*quality, risk-benefit, effectiveness and accessibility of drugs referred to ADEC for evaluation
*medical and scientific evaluations of applications for registration of new drugs

An important role of ADEC was the classification of drugs in Australia into [[Pregnancy category|pregnancy categories]].

The two main subcommittees of ADEC which were responsible for specific aspects of drug regulation in Australia:
*the [[Adverse Drug Reactions Advisory Committee]] (ADRAC) (replaced in 2010 by the separate Advisory Committee on the Safety of Medicines, ACSOM);
*the Pharmaceutical Subcommittee &amp;ndash; which made recommendations to ADEC on the [[pharmaceutical]] aspects ([[chemistry]], [[quality control]], [[pharmacokinetics]], etc.) of drugs proposed for registration (replaced by the pharmaceutical subcommittee of the ACPM).

[[File:Blind men and elephant.jpg|thumb|Blind men and elephant]]
The [[parable]] of the '''blind men and an elephant''' originated in the ancient [[Indian subcontinent]], from where it has been widely diffused. However the meaning of the popular [[proverb]] differs in other countries. It is a story of a group of blind men, who have never come across an [[elephant]] before and who learn and conceptualize what the elephant is like by touching it. Each blind man feels a different part of the elephant's body, but only one part, such as the side or the tusk. They then describe the elephant based on their limited experience and their descriptions of the elephant are different from each other. In some versions, they come to suspect that the other person is dishonest and they come to blows. The moral of the parable is that humans have a tendency to claim absolute truth based on their limited, subjective experience as they ignore other people's limited, subjective experiences which may be equally true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=E. Bruce Goldstein|title=Encyclopedia of Perception|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6M3NSNm6MlkC&amp;pg=PA492|year=2010|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-4129-4081-8|page=492}}, '''Quote:''' The ancient Hindu parable of the six blind men and the elephant...."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="snyder12"/&gt;

The first version of the story itself is traceable to the Buddhist text ''Udana 6.4'', dated to about mid 1st millennium BCE. According to John Ireland, the parable is likely older than the Buddhist text.&lt;ref name="Ireland2007p9"&gt;{{cite book|author=John D. Ireland|title=Udana and the Itivuttaka: Two Classics from the Pali Canon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kIllG8k-OmIC |year=2007|publisher=Buddhist Publication Society|isbn=978-955-24-0164-0|pages=9, 81–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternate version of the parable describes normal men, experiencing a large statue on a dark night, or feeling a large object while being blindfolded. They then describe what it is they have experienced. In its various versions, it is a parable that has crossed between many religious traditions and is part of [[Buddhist]], [[Hindu]] and [[Jainism|Jain]] texts of 1st millennium CE or before.&lt;ref name="Griffiths2007p46"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul J.

The tale later became well known in Europe, with 19th century American poet [[John Godfrey Saxe]] creating [[s:The Blind Men and the Elephant|his own version]] as a poem, with a final verse that explains that the elephant is a metaphor for God, and the various blind men represent religions that disagree on something no one has fully experienced.&lt;ref name="Gardner1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin Gardner|title=Famous Poems from Bygone Days|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lTRorcYPLH0C&amp;pg=PA124|accessdate=2012-08-25|date=1 September 1995|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|isbn=978-0-486-28623-5|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story has been published in many books for adults and children, and interpreted in a variety of ways.

==The parable==
{{anchor|The story}}
The earliest versions of the parable of blind men and elephant is found in Buddhist, Hindu and Jain texts, as they discuss the limits of perception and the importance of complete context. The parable has several Indian variations, but broadly goes as follows:&lt;ref name=goldstein492&gt;{{cite book|author=E. Bruce Goldstein|title=Encyclopedia of Perception|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6M3NSNm6MlkC&amp;pg=PA492|year=2010|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-4129-4081-8|page=492}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=snyder12&gt;{{cite book|author1=C.R. Snyder|author2=Carol E. Ford|title=Coping with Negative Life Events: Clinical and Social Psychological Perspectives|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Bo7gBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA12|year= 2013|publisher=Springer Science |isbn=978-1-4757-9865-4|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|A group of blind men heard that a strange animal, called an elephant, had been brought to the town, but none of them were aware of its shape and form. Out of curiosity, they said: "We must inspect and know it by touch, of which we are capable". So, they sought it out, and when they found it they groped about it. In the case of the first person, whose hand landed on the trunk, said "This being is like a thick snake". For another one whose hand reached its ear, it seemed like a kind of fan. As for another person, whose hand was upon its leg, said, the elephant is a pillar like a tree-trunk. The blind man who placed his hand upon its side said, "elephant is a wall". Another who felt its tail, described it as a rope. The last felt its tusk, stating the elephant is that which is hard, smooth and like a spear.}}

[[File:Illustrated proverb- Blind men and an elephant.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The blind men and the elephant &lt;br /&gt; (wall relief in Northeast Thailand)]]
In some versions, the blind men then discover their disagreements, suspect the others to be not telling the truth and come to blows. The stories also differ primarily in how the elephant's body parts are described, how violent the conflict becomes and how (or if) the conflict among the men and their perspectives is resolved. In some versions, they stop talking, start listening and collaborate to "see" the full elephant. In another, a sighted man enters the parable and describes the entire elephant from various perspectives, the blind men then learn that they were all partially correct and partially wrong. While one's subjective experience is true, it may not be the totality of truth.&lt;ref name="Ireland2007p9"/&gt;&lt;ref name=goldstein492/&gt;

The parable has been used to illustrate a range of truths and [[fallacies]]; broadly, the parable implies that one's subjective experience can be true, but that such experience is inherently limited by its failure to account for other truths or a totality of truth. At various times the parable has provided insight into the relativism, opaqueness or inexpressible nature of truth, the behavior of experts in fields of contradicting theories, the need for deeper understanding, and respect for different perspectives on the same object of observation.

==Hinduism==
The ''Rigveda'', dated to have been composed between 1500 and 1200 BCE, states "Reality is one, though wise men speak of it variously." According to Paul J. Griffiths, this premise is the foundation of universalist perspective behind the parable of the blind men and an elephant. The hymn asserts that the same reality is subject to interpretations and described in various ways by the wise.&lt;ref name="Griffiths2007p46"/&gt; In the oldest version, four blind men walk into a forest where they meet an elephant. In this version, they do not fight with each other, but conclude that they each must have perceived a different beast although they experienced the same elephant.&lt;ref name="Griffiths2007p46"/&gt; The expanded version of the parable occurs in various ancient and Hindu texts. Many scholars refer to it as a Hindu parable.&lt;ref name=goldstein492/&gt;&lt;ref name=snyder12/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[a] {{cite book|author=Chad Meister|title=Philosophy of Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1egYDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA11 |year=2016|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1-137-31475-8|pages=11–12}};&lt;br&gt;[b] {{cite book|author1=Jeremy P.

The parable or references appear in ''[[bhasya]]'' (commentaries, secondary literature) in the Hindu traditions. For example, [[Adi Shankara]] mentions it in his ''bhasya'' on verse 5.18.1 of the ''[[Chandogya Upanishad]]'' as follows:

{{Quote|

==Jainism==
[[File:Medieval Jain temple Anekantavada doctrine artwork.jpg|thumb|left|Seven blind men and an elephant parable at a Jain temple]]
The medieval era Jain texts explain the concepts of ''[[anekāntavāda]]'' (or "many-sidedness") and ''[[Anekantavada#Sy.C4.81dv.C4.81da|syādvāda]]'' ("conditioned viewpoints") with the [[parable]] of the blind men and an elephant (''Andhgajanyāyah''), which addresses the manifold nature of truth. For example, this parable are found in ''Tattvarthaslokavatika'' of [[Vidyananda (8th-century Jain monk)|Vidyanandi]] (9th century) and ''Syādvādamanjari'' of Ācārya Mallisena (13th century). Mallisena uses the parable to argue that immature people deny various aspects of truth; deluded by the aspects they ''do'' understand, they deny the aspects they ''don't'' understand. "Due to extreme delusion produced on account of a partial viewpoint, the immature deny one aspect and try to establish another. This is the maxim of the blind (men) and the elephant."&lt;ref&gt;Mallisena, ''Syādvādamanjari'', 14:103–104. Dhruva, A.B. (1933) pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt; Mallisena also cites the parable when noting the importance of considering all viewpoints in obtaining a full  picture of reality. "It is impossible to properly understand an entity consisting of infinite properties without the method of modal description consisting of all viewpoints, since it will otherwise lead to a situation of seizing mere sprouts (i.e., a superficial, inadequate cognition), on the maxim of the blind (men) and the elephant."&lt;ref&gt;Mallisena, ''Syādvādamanjari'',  19:75–77. Dhruva, A.B. (1933) pp. 23–25.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhism==
[[File:Blind monks examining an elephant.jpg|right|thumb|380px|''Blind monks examining an elephant'', an [[ukiyo-e]] print by [[Hanabusa Itchō]] (1652–1724).]]
[[Gautama Buddha|The Buddha]] twice uses the simile of blind men led astray. The earliest known version occurs in the text ''[[Udana]] 6.4''.&lt;ref name="Ireland2007p9"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Gomez | first=Luis O. | title=Proto-Madhyamika in the Pali Canon | journal=Philosophy East and West | publisher=Univ of Hawaii Press | volume=26 | issue=2 | year=1976 | doi=10.2307/1398186 | page=164 note 73; 137–165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Canki Sutta'' he describes a row of blind men holding on to each other as an example of those who follow an old text that has passed down from generation to generation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.095x.than.html Accesstoinsight.org]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060628152156/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.095x.than.html |date=2006-06-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Udana]] (68–69)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.katinkahesselink.net/tibet/blind-men-elephant.html Katinkahesselink.net]&lt;/ref&gt; he uses the elephant parable to describe sectarian quarrels. A king has the blind men of the capital brought to the palace, where an elephant is brought in and they are asked to describe it.

&lt;blockquote&gt;When the blind men had each felt a part of the elephant, the king went to each of them and said to each: 'Well, blind man, have you seen the elephant? Tell me, what sort of thing is an elephant?'&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The men assert the elephant is either like a pot (the blind man who felt the elephant's head), a [[winnowing|winnowing basket]] (ear), a [[plowshare]] (tusk), a [[plow]] (trunk), a [[granary]] (body), a [[Column|pillar]] (foot), a [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] (back), a [[pestle]] (tail) or a brush (tip of the tail).

The men cannot agree with one another and come to blows over the question of what it is like and their dispute delights the king. The Buddha ends the story by comparing the blind men to preachers and scholars who are blind and ignorant and hold to their own views: "Just so are these preachers and scholars holding various views blind and unseeing.... In their ignorance they are by nature quarrelsome, wrangling, and disputatious, each maintaining reality is thus and thus." The Buddha then speaks the following verse:
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;O how they cling and wrangle, some who claim
For preacher and monk the honored name!
For, quarreling, each to his view they cling.
Such folk see only one side of a thing.&lt;ref name=Buddhist&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~rywang/berkeley/258/parable.html |title=The Blind Men and the Elephant |first =Randy |last=Wang |accessdate=2006-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

==Sufism==
[[File:Blind men and elephant4.jpg|thumb|Blind men and the elephant.]]
The [[Persian people|Persian]] [[Sufi]] [[poet]] [[Sanai]] of [[Ghazni]] (currently, [[Afghanistan]]) presented this [[teaching story]] in his ''The Walled Garden of Truth''.&lt;ref&gt;Included in [[Idries Shah]], ''[[Tales of the Dervishes]]'' {{ISBN|0-900860-47-2}} [[Octagon Press]] 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rumi]], the 13th Century Persian poet and teacher of Sufism, included it in his [[Masnavi]]. In his retelling, "The Elephant in the Dark", some Hindus bring an elephant to be exhibited in a dark room. A number of men touch and feel the elephant in the dark and, depending upon where they touch it, they believe the elephant to be like a water spout (trunk), a fan (ear), a pillar (leg) and a throne (back). Rumi uses this story as an example of the limits of individual perception:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The sensual eye is just like the palm of the hand. The palm has not the means of covering the whole of the beast.&lt;ref name="Rumi"&gt;{{cite web |title=71 – The Elephant in the dark, on the reconciliation of contrarieties |url=http://www.khamush.com/tales_from_masnavi.htm#The%20Elephant |work=Rumi – Tales from Masnavi |date=2004-05-09 |first=A.J. |last= Arberry |accessdate=2006-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rumi does not present a resolution to the conflict in his version, but states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The eye of the Sea is one thing and the foam another. Let the foam go, and gaze with the eye of the Sea. Day and night foam-flecks are flung from the sea: oh amazing! You behold the foam but not the Sea. We are like boats dashing together; our eyes are darkened, yet we are in clear water.&lt;ref name="Rumi" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rumi ends his poem by stating "If each had a candle and they went in together the differences would disappear." &lt;ref&gt;For an adaptation of Rumi's poem, see this song version by David Wilcox [http://davidwilcox.com/index.php?page=songs&amp;display=1998&amp;category=Out_Beyond_Ideas here] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101009233459/http://davidwilcox.com/index.php?page=songs&amp;display=1998&amp;category=Out_Beyond_Ideas |date=October 9, 2010 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==John Godfrey Saxe==
One of the most famous versions of the 19th century was the poem "[[s:The Blind Men and the Elephant|The Blind Men and the Elephant]]" by [[John Godfrey Saxe]] (1816–1887).
[[File:Blind men and elephant3.jpg|right|thumb|350px|
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;And so these men of Indostan&lt;ul&gt;Disputed loud and long,&lt;/ul&gt;Each in his own opinion&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;Exceeding stiff and strong,&lt;/ul&gt;Though each was partly in the right&lt;ul&gt;And all were in the wrong!&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}]]
The poem begins:
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;It was six men of Indostan
    To learning much inclined,
Who went to see the Elephant
    (Though all of them were blind),
That each by observation
    Might satisfy his mind&lt;ref name=Saxe&gt;{{cite wikisource|plaintitle=The poems of John Godfrey Saxe|chapter=The Blind Men and the Elephant|last=Saxe|first=John Godfrey|authorlink=John Godfrey Saxe|wspage=260|scan=Page:The poems of John Godfrey Saxe.djvu/279}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

Each in his own opinion concludes that the elephant is like a wall, snake, spear, tree, fan or rope, depending upon where they had touched. Their heated debate comes short of physical violence, but the conflict is never resolved.
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;
    '''Moral:'''
So oft in theologic wars,
    The disputants, I ween,
Rail on in utter ignorance
    Of what each other mean,
And prate about an Elephant
    Not one of them has seen!&lt;/poem&gt;}}

[[Natalie Merchant]] sang this poem in full on her [[Leave Your Sleep]] album (Disc 1, track 13).

== The meaning as proverb by country or domain ==
=== Japan ===
In Japan, the proverb is used as a simile of circumstance that ordinary men often fail to understand a great man or his great work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=日本国語大辞典|last=|first=|work=小学館国語辞典編集部|publisher=小学館|year=2001-04-20|isbn=4-09-521004-4|edition=2|volume=4 きかく～けんう|location=Tokyo|pages=1188|language=ja|chapter=群盲象を評す}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern treatments==
The story is seen as a [[metaphor]] in many disciplines, being pressed into service as an [[analogy]] in fields well beyond the traditional. In [[physics]], it has been seen as an analogy for the [[wave–particle duality]].&lt;ref&gt;For example, [https://books.google.com/books?id=9DWim3RhymsC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;lpg=PA26&amp;dq=wave+particle+duality+elephant+blind+men&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6G_1s_oA6v&amp;sig=UaEauX5CaISP-azpgp0NXQCRwU0&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=YYaOS7WbOKf20gSH8-zmDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CA0Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=wave%20particle%20duality%20elephant%20blind%20men&amp;f=false ''Quantum theory''] by David Bohm, p. 26. Retrieved 2010-03-03.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[biology]], the way the blind men hold onto different parts of the elephant has been seen as a good analogy for the [[Polyclonal B cell response]].&lt;ref&gt;See for instance ''The lymph node in HIV pathogenesis'' by Michael M. Lederman and Leonid Margolis, ''Seminars in Immunology'', Volume 20, Issue 3, June 2008, pp. 187–195.&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Blind men and elephant.png|thumb|"Blind men and elephant", &lt;small&gt;from Martha Adelaide Holton &amp; Charles Madison Curry, ''Holton-Curry readers''&lt;/small&gt;, 1914.]]The fable is one of a number of tales that cast light on the response of hearers or readers to the story itself. [[Idries Shah]] has commented on this element of [[self-reference]] in the many interpretations of the story, and its function as a [[teaching stories|teaching story]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;...people address themselves to this story in one or more [...] interpretations. They then accept or reject them. Now they can feel happy; they have arrived at an opinion about the matter. According to their conditioning they produce the answer. Now look at their answers. Some will say that this is a fascinating and touching allegory of the presence of God. Others will say that it is showing people how stupid mankind can be. Some say it is anti-scholastic. Others that it is just a tale copied by Rumi from Sanai – and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.idriesshah.info/Shah/ShahTeaStor.htm |title=The Teaching Story: Observations on the Folklore of Our "Modern" Thought |first=Idries |last=Shah |accessdate=2010-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Shah adapted the tale in his book ''[[The Dermis Probe]]''. This version begins with a conference of scientists, from different fields of expertise, presenting their conflicting conclusions on the material upon which a camera is focused. As the camera slowly zooms out it gradually becomes clear that the material under examination is the hide of an African elephant. The words 'The Parts Are Greater Than The Whole' then appear on the screen. This retelling formed the script for a short four-minute film by the animator [[Richard Williams (animator)|Richard Williams]]. The film was chosen as an Outstanding Film of the Year and was exhibited at the London and New York film festivals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.octagonpress.com/titles/books/depr.htm Octagon Press page for The Dermis Probe] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726115510/http://www.octagonpress.com/titles/books/depr.htm |date=July 26, 2011 }}, with preview of story&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rockethouse.co.uk/Elephant/|title=touching the elephant|publisher=The Rockethouse|accessdate=21 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The story enjoys a continuing appeal, as shown by the number of illustrated children's books of the fable; there is one for instance by [[Paul Galdone]] and another, ''Seven Blind Mice'', by [[Ed Young (illustrator)|Ed Young]] (1992).

In the title cartoon of one of his books, cartoonist [[Sam Gross]] postulated that one of the blind men, encountering a pile of the elephant feces, concluded that "An elephant is soft and mushy."

An [[elephant joke]] inverts the story in the following way:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Six blind elephants were discussing what men were like. After arguing they decided to find one and determine what it was like by direct experience. The first blind elephant felt the man and declared, 'Men are flat.' After the other blind elephants felt the man, they agreed.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{anchor|Biliteral|Triliteral|Multiliteral}}A '''Carroll diagram''', '''Lewis Carroll's square''', '''biliteral diagram''' or a ''two-way table'' is a [[diagram]] used for grouping things in a yes/no fashion. Numbers or objects are either categorised as 'x' (having an [[wiktionary:attribute#Noun|attribute]] x) or 'not x' (not having an attribute 'x'). They are named after [[Lewis Carroll]], the [[pseudonym]] of [[Charles Lutwidge Dodgson]].&lt;ref name="Ley_2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SJS_2013"/&gt;

==Usage==
[[Image:Carroll Diagram (two criteria).svg|thumb|A more complex Carroll diagram.]]
Although Carroll diagrams can be as simple as the first one above, the most well known types are those similar to the second one, where two attributes are shown. The &lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;universe&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; of a Carroll diagram is contained within the boxes in the diagram, as any [[number]] or [[Object (philosophy)|object]] has to either have an attribute or not have it.

Carroll diagrams are often learnt by [[schoolchildren]], but they can also be used outside the field of [[education]], since they are a tidy way of categorising and displaying information.

The '''Cegléd water jug''' ({{lang-hu|'Ceglédi kanna'}}) is a container for water named after the city of [[Cegléd]], Hungary. It is also used as a [[musical instrument]] in [[folk music]], in particular, in [[Romani music]] of Hungary.&lt;ref name=cepa&gt;[http://www.cegledipanorama.hu/index.php/lexikon/2163-cegl%C3%A9di-kanna.html "Ceglédi kanna"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150225094258/http://www.cegledipanorama.hu/index.php/lexikon/2163-cegl%C3%A9di-kanna.html |date=2015-02-25 }}, ''Ceglédi Panorama''; lexicon&lt;/ref&gt;

==Container==

A Cegléd [[jug (container)|jug]] is a 7&amp;ndash;9 liter metal jug for water, with a handle and a lid. It is a relatively modern invention. They were first manufactured by a János Rónay  in Cegléd in the 1910s. Before the wide distribution of [[water pipelines]], Cegléd jugs were popular for delivery of water to farmers during harvest, construction and other workers away from residential places.&lt;ref name=cepa/&gt; They quickly became popular, because they were not fragile like pottery jugs, easy to carry by hand, on bicycle or in a car, and were easy to clean. Since there was only one manufacturer for a long time, the name stuck.&lt;ref name=mava&gt;[http://www.magyarvagyok.com/kultura/hungarikum/nepi-hangszerek/idiofonok/1103-Cegledi-kanna.html "Ceglédi kanna"], ''Magyar Vagyok'',  Zoltán Kabai, September 15, 2010 (retrieved February 28, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally Cegléd jugs were made of galvanized tin. Later they were made of  aluminium and steel, both bare metal and enamel-covered, typically of red, blue or white color. Despite the complicated shape, the jug (without handle) was made of a single metal sheet. For sturdiness, the mouth and bottom rims were doubly folded.  The handle was attached by rivets.&lt;ref name=mava/&gt;

==Musical instrument==
Cegléd jugs became a rhythm musical instrument among Romani in 1970 through the 1980s. The first usage of the jug is attributed to Károly Rostás ("Huttyán"). Later it was perfected by other Roma musicians, such as [[Kalyi Jag (group)|Kalyi Jag]].&lt;ref name=cepa/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nol.hu/kultura/20091127-brummogo_bogo_helyett_cegledi_kanna-443961 "Brummogó bőgő helyett ceglédi kanna"], László Rab, ''NOL'' (''[[Népszabadság]]'' Online), November 27, 2009 (retrieved February 27, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; When hit by palms, Cegléd jugs produce a wide variety of sounds, depending on the place hit (handle, body, rim), whether it is struck or slapped, whether the jug mouth is muffled, etc.&lt;ref name=cepa/&gt;  The combination of metal sound and deep dull sound of the air cavity puts the instrument in categories of [[idiophone]]s and [[wind instrument]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Sárosi, Bálint ''Hangszerek a magyar néphagyományban'' (" Musical Instruments in Hungarian Folklore"), Budapest, Planétás, 1998, {{ISBN|9639014354}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 and 2009, two ''Ceglédi KannaBál'' festivals, that highlighted this musical instrument, took place.&lt;ref name=cepa/&gt; In addition to traditional Romani music, the festival featured [[reggae]], [[jazz]] and [[blues music]] bands which used  Ceglédi jugs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ctv.hu/archivum/3728.html "1. Ceglédi KannaBál"], archive of Cegléd City Television (CVT)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.port.hu/cegledi_kannabal/pls/w/festival.festival_page?i_festival_id=5617 "Ceglédi KannaBál 2009"]&lt;/ref&gt;  The kanna pioneer József Nagy of Kalyi Jag told the history of the instrument and taught how to play it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://est.hu/cikk/57752/ "Ceglédi KannaBál"], ''Est magazin'' July 22, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Ceiling Painting/Yes Painting''''' is a 1966 conceptual artwork by the Japanese artist [[Yoko Ono]].

==Work==
The work is made from paper, glass, a metal frame, a metal chain, a magnifying glass, and a painted ladder. The word YES is printed on the piece of paper.&lt;ref name='Bilbao'&gt;{{cite web|title=Ceiling Painting, Yes Painting|url=http://yokoono.guggenheim-bilbao.eus/en/artworks/ceiling-painting-yes-painting.html|publisher=Guggenheim Museum Bilbao|accessdate=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work is interactive, with the viewer (or participant) expected to climb the ladder and use a magnifying glass to look at the word 'YES' which is printed on paper beneath a sheet of glass suspended from the ceiling.&lt;ref name='Bilbao'/&gt;

==History==
The work was shown at Ono's autumn 1966 show, ''Unfinished Paintings and Objects By Yoko Ono'' at the [[Indica Gallery]] in London.&lt;ref name='Bilbao'/&gt; Two different ladders were used by Ono in the New York and subsequent London showing of the piece.&lt;ref name="Buskirk2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Martha Buskirk|title=Creative Enterprise: Contemporary Art Between Museum and Marketplace|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ELqZ5YQZ1HUC|date=12 April 2012|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=978-1-4411-8820-5|page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt; The piece was displayed at Ono's 2014 retrospective at the [[Guggenheim Museum Bilbao]].&lt;ref name='Bilbao'/&gt;

The relationship of the participant to the piece has changed in subsequent decades. At a retrospective in 2000, ''Ceiling Painting/Yes Painting'' was displayed on a pedestal with physical interaction no longer possible. Interaction with Ono's ''Painting to Hammer a Nail'' was equally limited, with the piece having been displayed behind plexiglass.&lt;ref name="Buskirk2012"/&gt;

The preview night of Ono's INDICA exhibition on 9 November 1966 was visited by the musician [[John Lennon]] who had heard that "this amazing woman was going to be putting on a show...and it was going to be a bit of a happening". Lennon was initially impressed by the humour of Ono's work ''[[Apple (artwork)|Apple]]'', and later said of his interaction with ''Ceiling Painting/Yes Painting'' that he had "climbed the ladder, looked through the spyglass, and in tiny little letters it said 'yes'...So it was positive. I felt relieved".&lt;ref name="BeramBoriss-Krimsky2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nell Beram|author2=Carolyn Boriss-Krimsky|title=Yoko Ono: Collector of Skies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6pCOWKp3LZ0C|date=1 February 2012|publisher=Abrams|isbn=978-1-61312-513-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lennon's initial interaction with ''Ceiling Painting/Yes Painting'' was depicted in the Canadian playwright [[Jean Yoon]]'s 2002 play ''The Yoko Ono Project''.&lt;ref name="YoonOno2002"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jean Yoon|author2=Yōko Ono|title=The Yoko Ono Project|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fGahrFq9-FgC|year=2002|publisher=Broken Jaw Press|isbn=978-1-55391-001-5|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The positive message of the piece attracted Lennon to Ono, the pair were subsequently introduced with neither apparently knowing much about each other's creative work.&lt;ref name="BeramBoriss-Krimsky2012"/&gt; Ono recalled in a 2014 interview with art critic [[Jonathan Jones (journalist)|Jonathan Jones]] for ''[[The Guardian]]'' that "The ladder John had to climb up was very high" with Jones writing that the "smallness of the yes and the difficulty of reaching it" reflected Ono's pain after the breakup of a recent relationship.&lt;ref name=Guard14&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/mar/13/yoko-ono-guggenheim-bilbao-conceptual-influence|title=Yoko Ono show at Guggenheim shines light on pioneering conceptual artist|date=13 March 2014|author=Jonathan Jones (journalist)|work=The Guardian|accessdate=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation==
''Ceiling Painting/Yes Painting'' has been described by Ono as being representative of a journey towards [[hope]] and affirmation from [[pain]]. The difficulty in attaining hope and affirmation has been likened by Ono to the intimidating stature of a cathedral.&lt;ref name='ArtStory'&gt;{{cite web|title=Ceiling Painting, Yes Painting|url=http://www.theartstory.org/artist-ono-yoko-artworks.htm|publisher=The Art Story|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship between ''Ceiling Painting/Yes Painting'' and Ono's 1964 work ''Cut Piece'' was extensively critiqued by James M. Harding in his essay "Between Material and Matrix: Yoko Ono's ''Cut Piece'' and the Unmaking of Collage" in his 2012 book of essays, ''Cutting Performances: Collage Events, Feminist Artists, and the American Avant-Garde''.&lt;ref name="Harding2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=James M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11734">The '''classical limit''' or '''correspondence limit''' is the ability of a [[theoretical physics|physical theory]] to approximate or "recover" [[classical mechanics]] when considered over special values of its parameters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bohm |first=D. |author-link=David Bohm |year=1989 |title=Quantum Theory |publisher=[[Dover Publications]] |isbn=0-486-65969-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The classical limit is used with physical theories that predict non-classical behavior.

==Quantum theory==
A [[heuristic]] postulate called the [[correspondence principle]] was introduced to [[Bohr model|quantum theory]] by [[Niels Bohr]]: in effect it states that some kind of continuity argument should apply to the classical limit of quantum systems as the value of [[Planck's constant]] normalized by the action of these systems becomes very small. Often, this is approached through "quasi-classical" techniques (cf. [[WKB approximation]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Landau |first1=L. D. |author1-link=Lev Landau |last2=Lifshitz |first2=E. M. |author2-link=Evgeny Lifshitz |year=1977 |title=Quantum Mechanics: Non-Relativistic Theory |edition=3rd |volume=Vol. 3 |publisher=[[Pergamon Press]] |isbn=978-0-08-020940-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More rigorously,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hepp |first=K. |author1-link=Klaus Hepp |year=1974 |title=The classical limit for quantum mechanical correlation functions |url=http://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.cmp/1103859623 |journal=[[Communications in Mathematical Physics]] |volume=35 |issue= 4|pages=265–277 |bibcode=1974CMaPh..35..265H |doi=10.1007/BF01646348 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the mathematical operation involved in classical limits is a [[group contraction]], approximating physical systems where the relevant action is much larger than Planck's constant {{mvar|ħ}}, so the "deformation parameter" {{mvar|ħ}}/{{mvar|S}} can be effectively taken to be zero (cf. [[Weyl quantization]].) Thus typically, quantum commutators (equivalently, [[Moyal bracket]]s) reduce to [[Poisson bracket]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Curtright |first1=T. L. |last2=Zachos |first2=C. K. |year=2012 |title=Quantum Mechanics in Phase Space |journal=[[Asia Pacific Physics Newsletter]] |volume=1 |issue= |pages=37 |doi=10.1142/S2251158X12000069|arxiv=1104.5269 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in a [[group contraction]].

In [[quantum mechanics]], due to [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg's]] [[uncertainty principle]], an [[electron]] can never be at rest; it must always have a non-zero [[kinetic energy]], a result not found in classical mechanics. For example, if we consider something very large relative to an electron, like a baseball, the uncertainty principle predicts that it cannot really have zero kinetic energy, but the uncertainty in kinetic energy is so small that the baseball can effectively appear to be at rest, and hence it appears to obey classical mechanics. In general, if large energies and large objects (relative to the size and energy levels of an electron) are considered in quantum mechanics, the result will appear to obey classical mechanics. The typical [[occupation number]]s involved are huge: a macroscopic harmonic oscillator with {{mvar|ω}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;Hz, {{mvar|m}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;10&amp;nbsp;g, and maximum [[amplitude]] {{mvar|x}}&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;10&amp;nbsp;cm, has {{math|''S''&amp;nbsp;≈&amp;nbsp;''E''/''ω''&amp;nbsp;≈ ''mωx''{{su|b=0|p=2}}/2&amp;nbsp;≈ 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kg·m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/s}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|ħn}}, so that {{mvar|n}}&amp;nbsp;≃&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt;. Further see [[Coherent states#The wavefunction of a coherent state|coherent states]]. It is less clear, however, how the classical limit applies to chaotic systems, a field known as [[quantum chaos]].

Quantum mechanics and classical mechanics are usually treated with entirely different formalisms: quantum theory using [[Hilbert space]], and classical mechanics using a representation in [[phase space]]. One can bring the two into a common mathematical framework in various ways. In the [[phase space formulation]] of quantum mechanics, which is statistical in nature, logical connections between quantum mechanics and classical statistical mechanics are made, enabling natural comparisons between them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bracken |first1=A. |last2=Wood |first2=J. |year=2006 |title=Semiquantum versus semiclassical mechanics for simple nonlinear systems |journal=[[Physical Review A]] |volume=73 |pages=012104 |arxiv=quant-ph/0511227 |bibcode=2006PhRvA..73a2104B |doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.73.012104 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Conversely, in the lesser-known [[Koopman–von Neumann classical mechanics|approach presented in 1932 by Koopman and von Neumann]], the dynamics of classical mechanics have been formulated in terms of an [[operator (physics)|operational]] formalism in [[Hilbert space]], a formalism used conventionally for quantum mechanics.

&lt;/ref&gt;

In a crucial paper (1933), [[Paul Dirac|Dirac]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dirac |first=P.A.M. |author-link=Paul Dirac |year=1933 |title=The Lagrangian in quantum mechanics |url=http://www.ifi.unicamp.br/~cabrera/teaching/aula%2015%202010s1.pdf |journal=[[Physikalische Zeitschrift der Sowjetunion]] |volume=3 |issue= |pages=64–72}}&lt;/ref&gt; explained how classical mechanics is an [[Emergence#Non-living, physical systems|emergent phenomenon]] of quantum mechanics: [[Destructive interference#Quantum interference|destructive interference]] among paths with non-[[extremal]] macroscopic actions {{mvar|S}}&amp;nbsp;»&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|ħ}} obliterate amplitude contributions in the [[path integral formulation|path integral]] he introduced, leaving the extremal action {{mvar|S}}&lt;sub&gt;class&lt;/sub&gt;, thus the classical action path as the dominant contribution, an observation further elaborated by [[Richard Feynman|Feynman]] in his 1942 PhD dissertation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Feynman |first=R. P. |author-link=Richard Feynman |year=1942 |title=The Principle of Least Action in Quantum Mechanics |type=Ph.D. Dissertation |publisher=[[Princeton University]]}}

==Time-evolution of expectation values==
{{main|Ehrenfest theorem}}
One simple way to compare classical to quantum mechanics is to consider the time-evolution of the ''expected'' position and ''expected'' momentum, which can then be compared to the time-evolution of the ordinary position and momentum in classical mechanics. The quantum expectation values satisfy the [[Ehrenfest theorem]]. For a one-dimensional quantum particle moving in a potential &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, the Ehrenfest theorem says&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2013}} Section 3.7.5&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;m\frac{d}{dt}\langle x\rangle = \langle p\rangle;\quad \frac{d}{dt}\langle p\rangle =  -\left\langle V'(X)\right\rangle .&lt;/math&gt;
Although the first of these equations is consistent with the classical mechanics, the second is not: If the pair &lt;math&gt;(\langle X\rangle,\langle P\rangle)&lt;/math&gt; were to satisfy Newton's second law, the right-hand side of the second equation would have read
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\langle p\rangle =-V'\left(\left\langle X\right\rangle\right)&lt;/math&gt;.
But in most cases,
:&lt;math&gt;\left\langle V'(X)\right\rangle\neq V'(\left\langle X\right\rangle)&lt;/math&gt;.
If for example, the potential &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is cubic, then &lt;math&gt;V'&lt;/math&gt; is quadratic, in which case, we are talking about the distinction between &lt;math&gt;\langle X^2\rangle&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\langle X\rangle^2&lt;/math&gt;, which differ by &lt;math&gt;(\Delta X)^2&lt;/math&gt;.

An exception occurs in case when the classical equations of motion are linear, that is, when &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is quadratic and &lt;math&gt;V'&lt;/math&gt; is linear. In that special case, &lt;math&gt;V'\left(\left\langle X\right\rangle\right)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\left\langle V'(X)\right\rangle&lt;/math&gt; do agree. In particular, for a free particle or a quantum harmonic oscillator, the expected position and expected momentum exactly follows solutions of Newton's equations.

For general systems, the best we can hope for is that the expected position and momentum will ''approximately'' follow the classical trajectories. If the wave function is highly concentrated around a point &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;V'\left(\left\langle X\right\rangle\right)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\left\langle V'(X)\right\rangle&lt;/math&gt; will be ''almost'' the same, since both will be approximately equal to &lt;math&gt;V'(x_0)&lt;/math&gt;. In that case, the expected position and expected momentum will remain very close to the classical trajectories, at least ''for as long as'' the wave function remains highly localized in position.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2013}} p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; 

Now, if the initial state is very localized in position, it will be very spread out in momentum, and thus we expect that the wave function will rapidly spread out, and the connection with the classical trajectories will be lost. When Planck's constant is small, however, it is possible to have a state that is well localized in ''both'' position and momentum. The small uncertainty in momentum ensures that the particle ''remains'' well localized in position for a long time, so that expected position and momentum continue to closely track the classical trajectories for a long time.

==Relativity and other deformations==
Other familiar deformations in physics involve:

*The deformation of classical Newtonian into relativistic mechanics ([[special relativity]]), with deformation parameter ''v/c''; the classical limit involves small speeds, so ''v/c''→0, and the systems appear to obey Newtonian mechanics.
*Similarly for the deformation of Newtonian gravity into [[general relativity]], with deformation parameter Schwarzschild-radius/characteristic-dimension, we find that objects once again appear to obey classical mechanics (flat space), when the mass of an object times the square of the [[Planck length]] is much smaller than its size and the sizes of the problem addressed.
*Wave optics might also be regarded as a deformation of [[geometrical optics|ray optics]] for deformation parameter ''λ/a''.
*Likewise, [[thermodynamics]] deforms to [[statistical mechanics]] with deformation parameter 1/''N''.

A '''cobalt bomb''' is a type of "[[salted bomb]]": a [[nuclear weapon]] designed to produce enhanced amounts of [[radioactive fallout]], intended to contaminate a large area with [[radioactive material]]. The concept of a [[Cobalt-60|cobalt]] bomb was originally described in a radio program by physicist [[Leó Szilárd]] on February 26, 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Armageddon Science: The Science of Mass Destruction|publisher=St. Martins Griffin|isbn=978-1-250-01649-2|author=Brian Clegg|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; His intent was not to propose that such a weapon be built, but to show that nuclear weapon technology would soon reach the point where it could end human life on Earth, a [[Doomsday device]].&lt;ref name="Bushan"&gt;{{cite book | last = Bhushan | first = K. | authorlink =  |author2=G.

This section was removed from later editions, but, according to Glasstone in 1978, not because it was inaccurate or because the weapons had changed.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Russian Federation]] has allegedly developed cobalt warheads for use with their [[Status-6 Oceanic Multipurpose System]] [[nuclear torpedo]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationalinterest.org/feature/russias-new-super-torpedo-carries-the-threat-nuclear-14537|title=Russia's New Super-Torpedo Carries the Threat of Nuclear Contamination|first=Michael|last=Peck|publisher=[[The National Interest]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2015/11/12/kremlin-controlled-tv-airs-secret-plans-for-new-submarine-launched-nuclear.html|title='Secret' Russian nuclear torpedo blueprint leaked|date=November 12, 2015|publisher=[[Fox News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rt.com/news/321640-leaked-russian-nuclear-torpedo/|title=‘Assured unacceptable damage’: Russian TV accidentally leaks secret ‘nuclear torpedo’ design|publisher=[[RT (TV network)|RT]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However many commentators doubt that this is a real project, and see it as more likely to be a staged leak to intimidate the United States. Amongst other comments on it, Edward Moore Geist wrote a paper in which he says that "Russian decision makers would have little confidence that these areas would be in the intended locations"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00963402.2016.1195199|title=Would Russia’s undersea “doomsday drone” carry a cobalt bomb?|first=Edward Moore|last=Geist|date=July 3, 2016|publisher=|volume=72|issue=4|pages=238–242|via=Taylor and Francis+NEJM|doi=10.1080/00963402.2016.1195199}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Russian military experts are cited as saying that "robotic torpedos could have other purposes, such as delivering deep-sea equipment or installing surveillance devices."&lt;ref name=BBC-Russia&gt;{{Cite news |title=Russia reveals giant nuclear torpedo in state TV 'leak' |date=November 12, 2015 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-34797252 |publisher=[[BBC News]] |access-date=February 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[British nuclear tests at Maralinga#Operation Antler|Operation Antler]]/Round 1 test by the British at the Tadje site in the [[British nuclear tests at Maralinga|Maralinga range]] in Australia on September 14, 1957, tested a bomb using cobalt pellets as a radiochemical tracer for estimating yield. This was considered a failure and the experiment was not repeated.&lt;ref name=arch&gt;{{cite web|title=1.6 Cobalt Bombs and other Salted Bombs |url=http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Nwfaq/Nfaq1.html#nfaq1.6|publisher=Nuclearweaponarchive.org |date= |accessdate=February 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Russia, the triple "[[Nuclear weapon design#Clean bombs|taiga]]" nuclear salvo test, as part of the preliminary March 1971 [[Pechora–Kama Canal]] project, produced relatively high amounts of Co-60 from the steel that surrounded the Taiga devices, with this [[neutron activation|fusion generated neutron activation]] product being responsible for about half of the gamma dose now (2011) at the test site. This high percentage contribution is largely because the devices did not rely much at all on fission reactions and thus the quantity of gamma emitting [[caesium-137]] fallout, is therefore comparatively low. [[photosynthesis|Photosynthesizing]] vegetation exists all around the lake that was formed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0265931X11000750|title=Radiological investigations at the 'Taiga' nuclear explosion site: Site description and in situ measurements| doi=10.1016/j.jenvrad.2011.04.003 |volume=102|pages=672–680|journal=Journal of Environmental Radioactivity}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0265931X11003043|title=Radiological investigations at the 'Taiga' nuclear explosion site, part II: man-made γ-ray emitting radionuclides in the ground and the resultant kerma rate in air| doi=10.1016/j.jenvrad.2011.12.009|volume=109|pages=1–12|journal=Journal of Environmental Radioactivity}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanism==
A cobalt bomb could be made by placing a quantity of ordinary [[cobalt]] metal (&lt;sup&gt;59&lt;/sup&gt;Co) around a [[thermonuclear bomb]].  When the bomb explodes, the [[neutron]]s produced by the fusion reaction in the secondary stage of the thermonuclear bomb's explosion would [[nuclear transmutation|transmute]] the cobalt to the radioactive [[cobalt-60]] (&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Co), which would be vaporized by the explosion.  The cobalt would then condense and fall back to Earth with the dust and debris from the explosion, contaminating the ground.

The deposited cobalt-60 would have a [[half-life]] of 5.27 years, decaying into  [[Nickel-60|&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Ni]] and emitting two [[gamma ray]]s with energies of 1.17 and 1.33 [[megaelectronvolt|MeV]], hence the overall nuclear equation of the reaction is:

{{nuclide|cobalt|59}} + n → {{nuclide|cobalt|60}} → {{nuclide|nickel|60}} + e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + gamma rays.

Nickel-60 is a stable isotope and undergoes no further decays after emitting the gamma rays.

The 5.27 year half life of the &lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Co is long enough to allow it to settle out before significant decay has occurred, and to render it impractical to wait in [[bomb shelter|shelters]] for it to decay, yet short enough that intense radiation is produced.&lt;ref name=arch /&gt; Many isotopes are more radioactive ([[gold-198]], [[tantalum-182]], [[zinc-65]], [[sodium-24]], and many more), but they would decay faster, possibly allowing some population to survive in shelters.

==Fallout from cobalt bombs vs. other nuclear weapons==
[[Fission products]] are more deadly than neutron-activated cobalt in the first few weeks following detonation. After one to six months, the fission products from even a large-yield thermonuclear weapon decay to levels tolerable by humans. The large-yield three-stage (fission–fusion–fission) thermonuclear weapon is thus automatically a weapon of radiological warfare, but its fallout decays much more rapidly than that of a cobalt bomb. A cobalt bomb's fallout on the other hand would render affected areas effectively stuck in this interim state for decades: habitable, but not safe for constant habitation.

Initially, gamma radiation from the fission products of an equivalent size fission-fusion-fission bomb are much more intense than [[cobalt-60|Co-60]]: 15,000 times more intense at 1 hour; 35 times more intense at 1 week; 5 times more intense at 1 month; and about equal at 6 months. Thereafter fission product fallout radiation levels drop off rapidly, so that Co-60 fallout is 8 times more intense than fission at 1 year and 150 times more intense at 5 years. The very long-lived isotopes produced by fission would overtake the &lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Co again after about 75 years.&lt;ref name="Nuclear Weapons FAQ: 1.6"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Nwfaq/Nfaq1.html#nfaq1.6|title=Section 1.0 Types of Nuclear Weapons|work=nuclearweaponarchive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theoretically, a device containing 510 [[metric ton]]s of Co-59 can spread 1 g of the material to each square km of the Earth's surface (510,000,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). If one assumes that all of the material is converted to Co-60 at 100 percent efficiency and if it is spread evenly across the Earth's surface, it is possible for a single bomb to kill every person on Earth. However, in fact, complete 100% conversion into Co-60 is unlikely; a 1957 British experiment at Maralinga showed that Co-59's neutron absorption ability was much lower than predicted, resulting in a very limited formation of Co-60 isotope in practice.

In addition, another important point in considering the effects of cobalt bombs is that deposition of fallout is not even throughout the path downwind from a detonation, so that there are going to be areas relatively unaffected by fallout and places where there is unusually intense fallout, so that the Earth would not be universally rendered lifeless by a cobalt bomb.&lt;ref name="gandd"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=The Effects of Nuclear Weapons |publisher=United States Department of Defense and Department of Energy |date=1977 |location=Washington, D.C. |url=http://www.alternatewars.com/WW3/WW3_Documents/Weapon_Effects/Effects_1977_09.pdf |editor1=Samuel Glasstone |editor2=Philip J. Dolan |edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The fallout and devastation following a nuclear detonation does not scale upwards linearly with the explosive yield (equivalent to tons of TNT). As a result, the concept of "overkill"—the idea that one can simply estimate the destruction and fallout created by a thermonuclear weapon of the size postulated by Leo Szilard's "cobalt bomb" thought experiment by extrapolating from the effects of thermonuclear weapons of smaller yields—is fallacious.&lt;ref name="bmart"&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Brian |last=Martin |title=The global health effects of nuclear war |journal=Current Affairs Bulletin |volume=59 |number=7 |date=December 1982 |pages=14–26 |url=http://www.bmartin.cc/pubs/82cab/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|date=July 2017}}

==Example of radiation levels vs. time==
Assume a cobalt bomb deposits intense fallout causing a dose rate of 10 [[sievert]]s (Sv) per hour. At this dose rate, any unsheltered person exposed to the fallout would receive a lethal dose in about 30 minutes (assuming a [[LD50|median lethal dose]] of 5 Sv). People in well-built shelters would be safe due to [[radiation protection|radiation shielding]].

After one half-life of 5.27 years, only half of the cobalt-60 will have decayed, and the dose rate in the affected area would be 5 Sv/hour. At this dose rate, a person exposed to the radiation would receive a lethal dose in 1 hour.

After 10 half-lives (about 53 years), the dose rate would have decayed to around 10 mSv/hour. At this point, a healthy person could spend 1 to 4 days exposed to the fallout with no immediate effects.

After 20 half-lives (about 105 years), the dose rate would have decayed to around 10 μSv/hour. At this stage, humans could remain unsheltered full-time since their yearly radiation dose would be about 80 mSv. However, this yearly dose rate is on the order of 30 times greater than the peacetime exposure rate of 2.5 mSv/year. As a result, the rate of cancer incidence in the survivor population would likely increase.

After 25 half-lives (about 130 years), the dose rate from cobalt-60 would have decayed to less than 0.4 μSv/hour (natural background radiation) and could be considered negligible.

==Decontamination==
{{See also|Cactus Dome|Radioactive contamination#Decontamination}}
In practice it is unlikely that people would simply sit and wait for nuclear decay to go to completion, as in all historical fallout cases, decontamination of valuable land has occurred. This is most commonly done with the use of simple equipment such as [[lead glass]] covered [[excavators]] and [[bulldozers]], similar to those employed in the [[Lake Chagan]] project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEqYroQEtA8|title=Born of Nuclear Blast: Russia's Lakes of Mystery|date=November 28, 2010|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; By skimming off the thin layer of fallout on the [[topsoil]] surface and burying it in the likes of a deep trench along with isolating it from [[ground water]] sources, the gamma air dose is cut by orders of magnitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-naweb.iaea.org/nafa/faqs-food-agriculture.html|title=Joint Division Questions &amp; Answers - Nuclear Emergency Response for Food and Agriculture, NAFA|author=Joint FAO/IAEA Programme|work=iaea.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;International Atomic Energy Agency

==Russian "Status-6"==
In 2015, a page from an apparent Russian nuclear-armed torpedo design was accidentally or deliberately leaked. The design was titled "Oceanic Multipurpose System Status-6". The document stated the torpedo would create "wide areas of radioactive contamination, rendering them unusable for military, economic or other activity for a long time". Its payload would be "many tens of megatons in yield". Russian government newspaper [[Rossiiskaya Gazeta]] speculated that the warhead would be a cobalt bomb. It is not known whether the Status-6 is a real project, or whether it is Russian disinformation.&lt;ref name=BBC-Russia/&gt;&lt;ref name=npr&gt;{{cite news|title=Buried In Trump's Nuclear Report: A Russian Doomsday Weapon|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2018/02/02/582087310/buried-in-trumps-nuclear-report-a-russian-doomsday-weapon|accessdate=4 February 2018|work=NPR.org|date=2 February 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018 the Pentagon's annual [[Nuclear Posture Review]] stated Russia is developing a system called the "Status-6 Oceanic Multipurpose System". If Status-6 does exist, it is not publicly known whether the leaked 2015 design is accurate, nor whether the 2015 claim that the torpedo might be a cobalt bomb is genuine.&lt;ref name=npr/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=U.S. calls for new nuclear weapons as Russia develops nuclear-armed torpedo|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/02/02/u-s-reverse-obama-decisions-catch-up-russia-china-rapidly-expanding-nuclear-capabilities-reverse-oba/302746002/|accessdate=4 February 2018|work=USA TODAY|date=2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Status-6 was officially disclosed and confirmed by Vladimir Putin in 2018 during his display of new Russian offensive weapons, including the Satan-2, Air Launched Iskander, Nuclear cruise-missile, and hypersonic glider.&lt;ref&gt;http://thesaker.is/putins-stunning-revelations-about-new-russian-weapons-systems/&lt;/ref&gt;

== In popular culture ==
In the 4th act of the classic [[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]] episode "[[Obsession (Star Trek: The Original Series)|Obsession]]", Ensign Garrovick refers to 10,000 Cobalt Bombs not equaling the power of less than one ounce of Antimatter.  

In ''[[Beneath the Planet of the Apes]]'' (1970) the main character, upon seeing that the underground people worship a giant bomb that can wipe out the world, comments "They finally made one, cased in cobalt" in reference to a cobalt bomb that could wipe out the world. Similarly, in the bestselling ''[[On the Beach (novel)|On the Beach]]'' (1957) the cobalt bomb was a symbol of man's hubris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=P. D.|title=Doomsday Men: The Real Dr Strangelove and the Dream of the Superweapon|publisher=Penguin UK|date=25 September 2008|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the black comedy ''[[Dr. Strangelove, or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb]]'' (1964), a type of cobalt-salted bomb is employed, with a [[Dead Hand (nuclear war)|Dead Hand]] mechanism, by the Soviet Union as a nuclear deterrent: if the system detects any nuclear attack, the doomsday device will be automatically unleashed. With unfortunate timing, a mentally ill American officer orders an attack on the USSR. One American bomber piloted by a hapless and unknowing crew gets through to their target; the Dead Hand mechanism works as designed and initiates a worldwide nuclear holocaust. The Russian Ambassador says "If you take, say, fifty H-bombs in the hundred megaton range and jacket them with Cobalt Thorium G, when they are exploded they will produce a doomsday shroud. A lethal cloud of radioactivity which will encircle the earth for ninety-three years!"

In the ''[[Spectreman]]'' episodes "Smash Alien Igorl!!" and "Enigma of the Cobalt Monster", the villainous Dr. Gori and race of Igorl aliens create a cobalt bomb from a heavy amount of cobalt found beneath a small village and place it within a monster, planning for it to destroy the world due to it reacting strongly to Earth's polluted atmosphere.

The '''e-Stewards''' Initiative is an electronics waste recycling standard created by the [[Basel Action Network]].

The program and the organization that created it grew out of the concern that electronic waste generated in wealthy countries was being dismantled in poor countries, often by underage workers. The young workers were being exposed to toxic metals and working in unsafe conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Recycling Electronic Wastes in Nigeria |url=http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/njihr/vol10/iss3/2 |journal=Northwestern Journal of International Human Rights |volume=10 |issue=3 |accessdate=8 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, BAN published the e-Stewards Standard for Responsible Recycling and Reuse of Electronic Equipment which set forth requirements for becoming a Certified e-Stewards Recycler—a program that "recognizes electronics recyclers that adhere to the most stringent environmentally and socially responsible practices when recovering hazardous electronic materials."&lt;ref name=rt&gt;{{cite news |title=Onsite Electronics Recycling earns e-Stewards certification |url=http://www.recyclingtoday.com/onsite-electronics-recycling-earns-e-stewards.aspx |accessdate=2 September 2011 |newspaper=Recycling Today |date=31 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recyclers that were qualified under the older Pledge program had until 1 September 2011 to achieve certification to the Standard by an e-Stewards Accredited Certification Body accredited by [[ANSI-ASQ National Accreditation Board (ANAB)|ANAB (ANSI-ASQ National Accreditation Board)]].

==Standard==
The e-Stewards Standard for Responsible Recycling and Reuse of Electronic Equipment was developed by the [[Basel Action Network]]. It is an industry-specific environmental management system standard that is the basis for the e-Stewards Initiative.   On 6 March 2012, BAN released and updated revised Version 2.0 to open public comment prior to its final adoption later in the spring of 2012.

The certification is available to all electronics recyclers and refurbishers. To achieve an e-Stewards certification organizations are subject to an initial Stage I and Stage II audit.  After passing such audits and being accepted by BAN, yearly surveillance audits take place to ensure organizations with the standard and have a registered [[ISO 14001]] environmental management system in place, as well as achieving numerous performance requirements including assuring no export of hazardous electronic wastes to developing countries, no use of prison labor and no dumping of toxic materials in municipal landfills.

[[File:Egocentrism1.Musfica.png|thumb|Egocentrism]]
'''Egocentrism''' is the inability to differentiate between self and other. More specifically, it is the inability to untangle subjective [[Schema (psychology)|schema]]s from objective reality and an inability to understand or assume any perspective other than one's own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Anderman|first1=Eric M.|last2=Anderman|first2=Lynley H.|title=Egocentrism|journal=Psychology of Classroom Learning: An Encyclopedia|date=2009|volume=1|pages=355–357|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CCX3027800102&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=cuny_hunter&amp;it=r&amp;p=GVRL&amp;sw=w&amp;asid=728b0bdaba5697edd4c746b81143d889}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=4jzwt9fUo1kC&amp;pg=PA134 134]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although egocentrism and [[narcissism]] appear similar, they are not the same. A person who is egocentric believes they are the center of attention, like a narcissist, but does not receive gratification by one's own admiration. Both [[Egotism|egotists]] and narcissists are people whose egos are greatly influenced by the approval of others, while for egocentrists this may or may not be true.

Although egocentric behaviors are less prominent in adulthood, the existence of some forms of egocentrism in adulthood indicates that overcoming egocentrism may be a lifelong development that never achieves completion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pronin|first1=Emily|last2=Olivola|first2=Christopher Y.|title=Encyclopedia of Human Development|date=2006|publisher=SAGE Reference|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|pages=441–442|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CCX3466300229&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=cuny_hunter&amp;it=r&amp;p=GVRL&amp;sw=w&amp;asid=511ed2d691ff0fe2e05fddeb93158426|accessdate=20 Oct 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adults appear to be less egocentric than children because they are faster to correct from an initially egocentric perspective than children, not because they are less likely to initially adopt an egocentric perspective.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Perspective taking in children and adults: Equivalent egocentrism but differential correction|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103104000241|journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|date = 2004-11-01|pages = 760–768|volume = 40|issue = 6|doi = 10.1016/j.jesp.2004.02.002|first = Nicholas|last = Epley|first2 = Carey K|last2 = Morewedge|first3 = Boaz|last3 = Keysar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, egocentrism is found across the life span: in infancy,&lt;ref name="Onishi, K. H. 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Onishi, K.

==During infancy==
The main concept infants and young children learn by beginning to show egocentrism is the fact that their thoughts, values, and behaviors are different from those of others, also known as the theory of mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Premack, D., Woodruff, G.|year=1978|title=Does the chimpanzee have a theory of mind?|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|volume=1|issue=4|pages=515–526|doi=10.1017/S0140525X00076512}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially when children begin to have social interactions with others, mainly the caregivers, they misinterpret that they are one entity, because they are together for a long duration of time and the caregivers often provide for the children's needs.  For example, a child may misattribute the act of their mother reaching to retrieve an object that they point to as a sign that they are the same entity, when in fact they are actually separate individuals.  As early as 15 months old,&lt;ref name="Onishi, K. H. 2005"/&gt; children show a mix of egocentrism and [[theory of mind]] when an agent acts inconsistently with how the children expect him to behave.  In this study the children observed the experimenter place a toy inside one of two boxes, but did not see  when the experimenter removed the toy from the original box and placed it in the other box, due to obstruction by a screen. When the screen was removed the children watched the experimenter reach to take the toy out of one of the boxes, yet because the children did not see the switching part, they looked at the experimenter's action much longer when she reached for the box opposite to the one she originally put the toy in.  Not only does this show the existence of infants' memory capacity, but it also demonstrates how they have expectations based on their knowledge, as they are surprised when those expectations are not met.

==During childhood==
According to [[George Butterworth (psychologist)|George Butterworth]] and Margaret Harris, during [[childhood]], one is usually unable to distinguish between what is [[Subjectivity|subjective]] and [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Butterworth G Harris M |title=Principles of developmental psychology |year=1994 |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc. |location=Hillsdale, NJ England}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Jean Piaget|Piaget]], "an egocentric child assumes that other people see, hear, and feel exactly the same as the child does."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.simplypsychology.org/preoperational.html|title=Preoperational Stage|year=2010|author=McLeod, Saul}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=January 2015}}

[[Jean Piaget]] (1896–1980) developed a theory about the development of human intelligence, describing the [[Piaget's theory of cognitive development|stages of cognitive development]]. He claimed that early childhood is the time of pre-operational thought, characterized by children's inability to process logical thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|authors=Pronin, E., &amp; Olivola, C. Y.|year=2006 | url = http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CCX3466300229&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=cuny_hunter&amp;it=r&amp;p=GVRL&amp;sw=w&amp;asid=511ed2d691ff0fe2e05fddeb93158426 | title =  Egocentrism|editor=N. J. Salkind|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Human Development|volume=1|pages=441–442|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|publisher=SAGE Reference|accessdate=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Piaget, one of the main obstacles to logic that children possess includes centration, "the tendency to focus on one aspect of a situation to the exclusion of others."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Invitation to the Life Span, Second Edition|last = Berger|first = Kathleen Stassen|publisher = Worth Publishers|year = 2014|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; A particular type of centration is egocentrism – literally, "self-centeredness." Piaget claimed that young children are egocentric, capable of contemplating the world only from their personal perspective. For example, a three-year-old presented his mother a model truck as her birthday present; "he had carefully wrapped the present and gave it to his mother with an expression that clearly showed he expected her to love it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Theories of Development: Concepts and Applications, Fifth Edition|last = Crain|first = William C.|publisher = Prentice Hall|year = 2005|isbn = |location = Upper Saddle River, NJ|pages = 108}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three-year-old boy had not chosen the present out of [[selfishness]] or greediness, but he simply failed to realize that, from his mother's perspective, she might not enjoy the model car as much as he would.

Piaget was concerned with two aspects of egocentricity in children: [[language]] and [[morality]].&lt;ref name="Fogiel"&gt;{{cite book |last=Fogiel |first=M |title=The psychology problem solver: a complete solution guide to any textbook |year=1980 |publisher=Research &amp; Education Association |location=New Jersey, NJ US}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that egocentric children use language primarily for communication with oneself. Piaget observed that children would talk to themselves during play, and this egocentric speech was merely the child's thoughts.&lt;ref name="Junefelt"&gt;{{cite book |last=Junefelt |first=K |title=Rethinking egocentric speech: towards a new hypothesis |year=2007 |publisher=[[Nova Science Publishers, Inc.]] |location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that this speech had no special function; it was used as a way of accompanying and reinforcing the child's current activity. He theorized that as the child matures cognitively and socially the amount of egocentric speech used would be reduced.&lt;ref name="Junefelt" /&gt; However, [[Vygotsky]] felt that egocentric speech has more meaning, as it allows the child's growth in social speech and high mental development.&lt;ref name="Junefelt" /&gt; In addition to Piaget's theory, he believed that when communicating with others, the child believes that others know everything about the topic of discussion and become frustrated when asked to give further detail.&lt;ref name="Fogiel" /&gt;

Piaget also believed that egocentrism affects the child's sense of morality.&lt;ref name="Fogiel" /&gt; Due to egocentrism, the child is only concerned with the final outcome of an event rather than another's intentions. For example, if someone breaks the child's toy, the child would not forgive the other and the child would not be able to understand that the person who broke the toy did not intend to break it.&lt;ref name="Fogiel" /&gt; This phenomenon can also be backed by the evidence from the findings of the case study by Nelson, who studied the use of motives and outcomes by young children as aiding to form their moral judgements.

Piaget did a test to investigate egocentrism called the mountains study. He put children in front of a simple plaster mountain range and then asked them to pick from four pictures the view that he, Piaget, would see. The younger children before age seven picked the picture of the view they themselves saw and were therefore found to lack the ability to appreciate a viewpoint different from their own. In other words, their way of reasoning was egocentric. Only when entering the concrete-operational stage of development at age seven to twelve, children became less egocentric and could appreciate viewpoints other than their own. In other words, they were capable of cognitive perspective-taking. However, the mountains test has been criticized for judging only the child's visuo-spatial awareness, rather than egocentrism. A follow up study involving police dolls showed that even young children were able to correctly say what the interviewer would see.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psychlotron.org.uk/newResources/cogdev/A2_AQB_cogDev_egocentrismTests.pdf |title=Tests of egocentrism  |last=Sammons |first=A |year=2010 |publisher=Psychlotron.org.uk |accessdate=19 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought that Piaget overestimated the extent of egocentrism in children. Egocentrism is thus the child's inability to see other people's viewpoints, not to be confused with selfishness. The child at this stage of [[cognitive development]] assumes that their view of the world is the same as other peoples.

In addition, a more well-known experiment by Wimmer and Perner (1983) called the false-belief task demonstrates how children show their acquisition of theory of mind (ToM) as early as 4 years old.&lt;ref name=Wimmer/&gt; In this task, children see a scenario where one character hides a marble in a basket, walks out of the scene, and another character that is present takes out the marble and put it in a box.  Knowing that the first character did not see the switching task, children were asked to predict where the first character would look to find the marble.  The results show that children younger than 4 answer that the character would look inside the box, because they have the superior knowledge of where the marble actually is.  It shows egocentric thinking in early childhood because they thought that even if the character itself did not see the entire scenario, it has the same amount of knowledge as oneself and therefore should look inside the box to find the marble.  As children start to acquire ToM, their ability to recognize and process others' beliefs and values overrides the natural tendency to be egocentric.

==During adolescence==
{{See|Adolescent egocentrism}}

Although most of the research completed on the study of egocentrism is primarily focused on early childhood development, it has been found to also occur during adolescence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Goossens L. |author2=Seiffge-Krenke I. |author3=Marcoen A. | year = 1992 | title = The many faces of adolescent egocentrism: Two European replications | url = | journal = Journal of Adolescent Research | volume = 7 | issue = 1| pages = 43–58 | doi = 10.1177/074355489271004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Elkind]] was one of the first to discover the presence of egocentrism in adolescence and late adolescence. He argues, "the young adolescent, because of the physiological metamorphosis he is undergoing, is primarily concerned with himself. Accordingly, since he fails to differentiate between what others are thinking about and his own mental preoccupations, he assumes that other people are obsessed with his behavior and appearance as he is himself."&lt;ref name="Elkind"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/1127100 |author=Elkind D |title=Egocentrism in adolescence |jstor=1127100 |journal=Child Dev |volume=38 |issue=4 |pages=1025–34 |date=December 1967 |pmid=5583052 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This shows that the adolescent is exhibiting egocentrism, by struggling to distinguish whether or not, in actuality, others are as fond of them as they might think because their own thoughts are so prevalent. Adolescents consider themselves as "unique, special, and much more socially significant than they actually are."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Elkind also created terms to help describe the egocentric behaviors exhibited by the adolescent population such as what he calls an [[imaginary audience]], the [[personal fable]], and the invincibility fable. Usually when an egocentric adolescent is experiencing an imaginary audience, it entails the belief that there is an audience captivated and constantly present to an extent of being overly interested about the egocentric individual. Personal fable refers to the idea that many teenagers believe their thoughts, feelings, and experiences are unique and more extreme than anyone else's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Vartanian LR |title=Revisiting the imaginary audience and personal fable constructs of adolescent egocentrism: a conceptual review |journal=Adolescence |volume=35 |issue=140 |pages=639–61 |date=Winter 2000 |pmid=11214204 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the invincibility fable, the adolescent believes in the idea that he or she is immune to misfortune and cannot be harmed by things that might defeat a normal person.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Egocentrism in adolescence is often viewed as a negative aspect of their thinking ability because adolescents become consumed with themselves and are unable to effectively function in society due to their skewed version of reality and cynicism.

There are various reasons as to why adolescents experience egocentrism:
* Adolescents are often faced with new social environments (for example, starting secondary school) which require the adolescent to protect the self which may lead to egocentrism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Peterson K. L. |author2=Roscoe B. | year = 1991 | title = Imaginary audience behavior in older adolescent females | url = | journal = Adolescence | volume = 26 | issue = 101| pages = 195–200 | pmid=2048473 | doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Development of the adolescent's identity may lead to the individual experiencing high levels of uniqueness which subsequently becomes egocentric – this manifests as the personal fable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=O'Connor B. P. |author2=Nikolic J. | year = 1990 | title = Identity development and formal operations as sources of adolescent egocentrism | url = | journal = Journal of Youth and Adolescence | volume = 19 | issue = 2| pages = 149–158 | doi = 10.1007/BF01538718 | pmid=24272375}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Parental rejection may lead to the adolescents experiencing high levels of self-consciousness, which can lead to egocentrism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Riley T. |author2=Adams G. R. |author3=Nielsen E. | year = 1984 | title = Adolescent egocentrism: The association among imaginary audience behavior, cognitive development, and parental support and rejection | url = | journal = Journal of Youth and Adolescence | volume = 13 | issue = 5| pages = 401–417 | doi = 10.1007/BF02088638 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study was completed on 163 undergraduate students to examine the adolescent egocentrism in college students.  Students were asked to complete a self-report questionnaire to determine the level of egocentrism present. The questions simply asked for the reactions that students had to seemingly embarrassing situations. It was found that adolescent egocentrism was more prevalent in the female population than the male.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rycek RF, Stuhr SL, McDermott J, Benker J, Swartz MD |title=Adolescent egocentrism and cognitive functioning during late adolescence |journal=Adolescence |volume=33 |issue=132 |pages=745–9 |date=Winter 1998 |pmid=9886002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This again exemplifies the idea that egocentrism is present in even late adolescence.

Results from other studies have come to the conclusion that egocentrism does not present itself in some of the same patterns as it was found originally. More recent studies have found that egocentrism is prevalent in later years of development unlike Piaget's original findings that suggested that egocentrism is only present in early childhood development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Myers, David G. |title=Psychology |publisher=Worth |location=New York |year=2008 |isbn=1-4292-2863-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Egocentrism is especially dominant in early adolescence, particularly when adolescents encounter new environments, such as a new school or a new peer group.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In addition, throughout adolescence egocentrism contributes to the development of self-identity; in order to achieve self-identity, adolescents go through different pathways of "crisis" and "commitment" stages,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Marcia, J. E.|year=1980|contribution=Identity in adolescence|editor=Adelson, J.|title=Handbook of Adolescent Psychology|publisher=Wiley|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; and higher self-identity achievement was found to be correlated with heightened egocentrism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=O'Connor, B. P.|author2=Nikolic, J.|lastauthoramp=y|year=1990|title=Identity development and formal operations as sources of adolescent egocentrism|journal=Journal of Youth and Adolescence|volume=19|issue=2|pages=149–158|pmid=24272375|doi=10.1007/BF01538718}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==During adulthood==
The prevalence of egocentrism in the individual has been found to decrease between the ages of 15 and 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Louw |first=DA |title=Human development, 2nd Ed. |year=1998 |publisher=Kagiso Tertiary |location=Cape Town, South Africa}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, adults are also susceptible to be egocentric or to have reactions or behaviours that can be categorized as egocentric.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Tesch S. |author2=Whitbourne S. K. |author3=Nehrke M. F. | year = 1978 | title = Cognitive egocentrism in institutionalized adult | url = | journal = Journal of Gerontology | volume = 33 | issue = 4| pages = 546–552 | doi=10.1093/geronj/33.4.546}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frankenberger tested adolescents (14–18 years old) and adults (20–89) on their levels of egocentrism and self-consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Frankenberger K. D. | year = 2000 | title = Adolescent egocentrism: A comparison among adolescents and adults | url = | journal = Journal of Adolescence | volume = 23 | issue = 3| pages = 343–354 | doi = 10.1006/jado.2000.0319 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was found that egocentric tendencies had extended to early adulthood and these tendencies were also present in the middle adult years.

Baron and Hanna looked at 152 participants and tested to see how the presence of [[Depression (mood)|depression]] affected egocentrism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Baron |first1=P |last2=Hanna |first2=J |year=1990 |title=Egocentrism and depressive symptomatology in young adults |journal=Social Behavior and Personality |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=279–285 |doi=10.2224/sbp.1990.18.2.279}}&lt;/ref&gt; They tested adults between the ages of 18 and 25 and found that the participants who suffered from depression showed higher levels of egocentrism than those who did not.

Finally, Surtees and Apperly found that when adults were asked to judge the number of dots they see and the number of dots the avatar in the computer simulation sees, the presence of the avatar interfered with the participants' judgment-making during the trials. Specifically, these were the trials where the number of dots seen by the participant was inconsistent from the number of dots the avatar saw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Surtees, A. D. R.|author2=Apperly, I. A.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2012|title=Egocentrism and automatic perspective taking in children and adults|journal=Child Development|volume=83|issue=2|pages=452–460|pmid=22335247|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2011.01730.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such effect on the participants diminished when the avatar was replaced with a simple yellow or blue line, which concluded that somehow the avatar having a personal attribute implicitly caused the participants to include its "vision" into their own decision making.  That said, they made more errors when they saw prompts such as "the avatar sees N" when N was the number of dots the participant saw and not the avatar, which shows that egocentric thought is still predominant in making quick judgments, even if the adults are well aware that their thoughts could differ from others.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9844">[[Image:Sangreal.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Holy Grail]], illustration by [[Arthur Rackham]], 1917. [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelite]] art at this time often represented contemporary interest in the "spirit body", "aura" or "body of light".]]
The '''etheric body''', '''ether-body''', '''æther body''', a name given by [[neo-Theosophy]] to a '''vital body''' or [[subtle body]] propounded in [[esoteric]] philosophies as the first or lowest layer in the "human energy field" or [[aura (paranormal)|aura]].&lt;ref&gt;Brennan, Barbara, ''Hands of Light : A Guide to Healing Through the Human Energy Field ([http://www.kheper.net/topics/subtlebody/BAB-etheric.htm Etheric body])'', Bantam Books, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; It is said to be in immediate contact with the [[Human anatomy|physical body]], to sustain it and connect it with "higher" bodies.

The English term "etheric" in this context seems to derive from the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophical]] writings of [[Madame Blavatsky]], but its use was formalised by [[Charles Webster Leadbeater|C.W. Leadbeater]]&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C. W., ''Man, Visible and Invisible'', 1902&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Annie Besant]]&lt;ref&gt;Besant, Annie, ''Man and His Bodies'', 1911&lt;/ref&gt; due to the elimination of Hindu terminology from the system of seven planes and bodies. ([[Theosophical Society Adyar|Adyar School of Theosophy]]).

The term gained some general popularity after the 1914-18 war, [[Walter John Kilner]] having adopted it for a layer of the "human atmosphere" which, as he claimed in a popular book, could be rendered visible to the naked eye by means of certain exercises.&lt;ref&gt;Kilner, Walter J., ''The Human Atmosphere, or the Aura Made Visible by the aid of Chemical Screens'', 1911, reprinted as "The Human Aura" by Citadel Press, NY, 1965, {{ISBN|0-8065-0545-1}}. The Aura, by Walter J. Kilner. Introd. by Sibyl Ferguson. New York, S. Weiser, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

The classical element [[Aether (classical element)|Aether]] of Platonic and Aristotlean physics continued in Victorian scientific proposals of a [[Luminiferous ether]] as well as the cognate chemical substance ether. According to Theosophists and [[Alice Bailey]] the etheric body inhabits an [[etheric plane]] which corresponds to the four higher subplanes of the [[physical plane]]. The intended reference is therefore to some extremely rarefied matter, analogous in usage to the word "spirit" (originally "breath"). In selecting it as the term for a clearly defined concept in an Indian-derived metaphysical system, the Theosophists aligned it with ideas such as the [[Kosha|prana-maya-kosha]] (sheath made of [[prana]], subtle breath or life-force) of [[Vedanta|Vedantic]] thought.

In popular use it is often confounded with the related concept of the [[astral body]] as for example in the term [[astral projection]] - the early Theosophists had called it the "astral double". Others prefer to speak of the "lower and higher astral".

== Accounts ==
{{planes of existence}}
[[Linga sarira]] is a Sanskrit term for the invisible double of the human body, the etheric body or etheric double (or [[astral body]] in some Theosophical concepts). It is one of the seven principles of the human being, according to Theosophical philosophy.

[[Rudolf Steiner]], the founder of [[Anthroposophy]], often referred to the etheric body (''Ätherleib'' or "Life Body") in association with the etheric formative forces and the [[Spiritual evolution|evolution]] of [[Human|man]] and the cosmos.&lt;ref&gt;Steiner, Rudolf, ''Occult science&amp;nbsp;– An Outline''. Trans. George and Mary Adams. London: Rudolf Steiner Press, 1909, 1969&lt;/ref&gt; According to him, it can be perceived by a person gifted with clairvoyance as being of "peach-blossom color".

Steiner considered the etheric reality or life principle as quite distinct from the physical material reality, being intermediate between the physical world and the astral or soul world.
The etheric body can be characterised as the life force also present in the plant kingdom. It maintains the physical body's form until death. At that time, it separates from the physical body and the physical reverts to natural disintegration.

According to [[Max Heindel]]'s [[Rosicrucian]] writings,&lt;ref&gt;Heindel, Max, ''The Rosicrucian Mysteries (Chapter IV, [http://www.rosicrucian.com/rms/rmseng02.htm#Chapter_IV The Constitution of Man: Vital Body - Desire Body - Mind])'', 1911, {{ISBN|0-911274-86-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; the etheric body, composed of four ethers, is called the "Vital Body" since the [[Aether (classical element)|ether]] is the way of ingress for vital force from the [[Sun]] and the field of agencies in nature which promote such vital activities as assimilation, growth, and propagation. It is an exact counterpart of our physical body, molecule for molecule, and organ for organ, but it is of the opposite polarity. It is slightly larger, extending about one and one-half inches beyond the periphery of the physical body.

[[Samael Aun Weor]] teaches that the vital body is the tetra-dimensional part of the physical body and the foundation of organic life.&lt;ref&gt;Samael Aun Weor, ''The Pistis Sophia Unveiled'', Thelema Press, (1983) 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Samael Aun Weor, "[http://www.gnosticteachings.org/content/view/230/99/ Death] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070509180046/http://www.gnosticteachings.org/content/view/230/99/ |date=2007-05-09 }}", ''The Book of the Dead'',  1966&lt;/ref&gt; He states that in the second Initiation of Fire, which is reached through working with [[Sex magic#Samael Aun Weor|sexual magic]] with a spouse, the [[Kundalini energy|Kundalini]] rises in the vital body. Then the initiate learns how to separate the two superior ethers from the others in order for them to serve as a vehicle to travel out of the physical body.&lt;ref&gt;Samael Aun Weor, ''The Three Mountains'', Thelema Press, (1972) 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

On the [[Tree of life (Kabbalah)|Tree of Life]] of the [[Kabbalah]], the vital body is often related to the [[Sephirot|sephirah]] [[Yesod (Kabbalah)|Yesod]].&lt;ref&gt;Samael Aun Weor, ''The Initiatic Path in the Arcana of Tarot and Kabbalah'', Thelema Press, (1978) 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

== Beings that possess only etheric bodies ==
In the teachings of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], [[Deva (New Age)|Devas]] are regarded as living either in the [[atmosphere]]s of the [[planet]]s of the [[solar system]] (''Planetary Angels'') or inside the [[Sun]] (''Solar Angels'') (presumably other [[planetary system]]s and [[star]]s have their own angels) and they help to guide the operation of the processes of [[nature]] such as the process of [[evolution]] and the growth of [[plants]]; their appearance is reputedly like colored flames about the size of a human being.  It is believed by Theosophists that devas can be observed when the [[third eye]] is activated.  Some (but not most) devas originally incarnated as [[human being]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Hodson, Geoffrey, ''Kingdom of the Gods'' {{ISBN|0-7661-8134-0}}&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; Has color pictures of what Devas supposedly look like when observed by the [[third eye]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; their appearance is reputedly like colored flames about the size of a human being. [https://web.archive.org/web/20040820064159/http://www.geocities.com/athens/Olympus/3987/devas2.html Paintings of some of the devas claimed to have been seen by Hodson from his book "Kingdom of the Gods":]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is believed by Theosophists that [[nature spirit]]s, [[elementals]] ([[gnome]]s, [[Ondine (mythology)|ondines]], [[sylphs]], and [[Salamander (legendary creature)|salamanders]]), and [[Fairy|fairies]] can also be observed when the [[third eye]] is activated.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20021121131124/http://geocities.com/athens/Olympus/3987/devas4.html Eskild Tjalve’s paintings of devas, nature spirits, elementals and fairies:]&lt;/ref&gt; It is maintained by Theosophists that these less evolutionarily developed beings have never been previously incarnated as human beings; they are regarded as on a separate line of spiritual evolution called the “deva evolution”; eventually, as their [[soul]]s advance as they [[Reincarnation|reincarnate]], it is believed they will incarnate as devas.&lt;ref&gt;Powell, A.E. ''The Solar System'' London:1930 The Theosophical Publishing House (A Complete Outline of the Theosophical Scheme of Evolution) See "Lifewave" chart (refer to index)&lt;/ref&gt;

It is asserted by Theosophists that all of the above-mentioned beings possess etheric bodies (but no physical bodies) that are composed of ''[[Etheric plane|etheric matter]]'', a type of matter finer and more pure that is composed of smaller particles than ordinary [[Matter|physical plane matter]].&lt;ref&gt;Powell, A.E.

'''Exaggeration''' is a representation of something in an excessive manner. The exaggerator has been a familiar figure in Western culture since at least [[Aristotle]]'s discussion of the [[alazon]]: 'the [[boaster]] is regarded as one who pretends to have distinguished qualities which he possesses either not at all or to a lesser degree than he pretends...exaggerating'.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Ethics'' (Penguin 1976) p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the opposite of [[Minimisation (psychology)|minimisation]].

Contexts of exaggeration include:

===Manipulation===
{{Main|Psychological manipulation}}
The [[boast]]ing and bragging by [[hubris|arrogant]] or manipulative people has been sent up on stage since the first appearance of the alazon – 'a stock character in Greek [[comedy]]'.&lt;ref&gt;H. J. Rose, ''A Handbook of Latin Literature'' (London 1966)p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; Inflated [[praise]] in the form of [[flattery]] and [[puffery]] has a similarly lengthy history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title="puff piece."

Amplifying achievements, obstacles and problems to [[attention seeking|seek attention]] is an everyday occurrence, as 'in ''exaggerating'' what one feels by magnifying the emotional expression: this is the ploy used by the six-year-old who dramatically twists her face into a pathetic frown, lips quivering, as she runs to complain to her mother about being teased'.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Goleman, ''Emotional Intelligence'' (London 1996) p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

Exaggerating is also a type of [[Deception#Types|deception]],&lt;ref name="Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007"&gt;Guerrero, L., Anderson, P., Afifi, W. (2007).

===Character assassination===
{{Main|Character assassination}}
Character assassination typically involves deliberate exaggeration or manipulation of facts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Thomas | first = D | title = Narcissism: Behind the Mask | year = 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cognitive distortions===
{{Main|Cognitive distortion}}
[[Cognitive behavioral therapy]] views ''magnification'' (as opposed to ''[[Minimisation (psychology)|minimization]]'') as unconscious, unrealistic mental processing or cognitive distortion, which can take the form of probability overestimation or of catastrophizing. This is better known as 'making a big deal out of nothing.' 'Whereas probability overestimation refers to exaggerating the "likelihood" of an event, catastrophizing refers to exaggerating the "importance" of the event'.&lt;ref&gt;M. M. Antony/P. J. Norton, ''The Anti-Anxiety Workbook'' (2008) p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Closely related 'is ''overgeneralizing'', where one takes a single negative event and see it as a never-ending pattern of defeat'.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Gilbert, ''Overcoming Depression'' (London 1999) p. 286&lt;/ref&gt;

Another form of cognitive exaggeration is inflation of the difficulty of achieving a goal after attaining it, possibly to improve [[self-esteem]].&lt;ref&gt;Beth Azar [http://www.apa.org/monitor/jun07/sciencewatch.aspx All puffed up] Monitor on Psychology June 2007, Vol 38, No. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[major depressive disorder|depression]], exaggerated all-or-nothing thinking can form a self-reinforcing cycle: these thoughts might be called ''emotional amplifiers'' because, as they go around and around, they become more intense. Here are some typical all-or-nothing thoughts:
* my efforts are either a success or they are an abject failure
* I am/other people are either all good or all bad
* if you're not with us, you're against us&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, p. 63 and p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Reaction formation====
[[Reaction formation]] ({{lang-de|Reaktionsbildung}}) is believed to be a [[defense mechanism]] in which emotions and impulses which are [[anxiety]]-producing or perceived to be unacceptable are mastered by exaggeration of the directly opposing tendency.&lt;ref name="defenses-psychpage"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

====Decatastrophizing====
{{Main|Decatastrophizing}}
In [[cognitive therapy]], decatastrophizing or decatastrophization is a [[cognitive restructuring]] technique to treat cognitive distortions, such as magnification and catastrophizing, commonly seen in psychological disorders like [[anxiety]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Ryan C. Martin, Eric R.

===Pathology===

[[Psychoanalysis]] considered that neurotic exaggerations were the products of [[Displacement (psychology)|displacement]]&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London 1994) p. 149&lt;/ref&gt; – overvaluations for example being used to maintain a repression elsewhere. Thus a conflict over [[ambivalence]] may be resolved by means of exaggerating one's love for a person so as to keep an unconscious hatred in further check.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Psychopathology'' (PFL 10) p. 317.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[grandiosity|grandiose]] sense of self-importance observed in [[narcissistic personality disorder|narcissists]]&lt;ref name="DSM-IV-TR"/&gt; also uses exaggeration to thwart any recognition  of a moderate fallibility, seeing any departure from complete success as total and hopeless failure.&lt;ref&gt;[[Neville Symington]], ''Narcissism: A New Theory'' (London 1993) p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;

"Self-dramatization, theatricality, and ''exaggerated'' expression of emotion" can be observed in those with [[histrionic personality disorder]]&lt;ref name="DSM-IV-TR"&gt;[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] Fourth edition Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) [[American Psychiatric Association]] (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; and other [[Personality disorder#Cluster B .28dramatic.2C emotional or erratic disorders.29|Cluster B personality disorders]]; while "catastrophizing" is associated with [[Depression (mood)|depressive]], [[neurosis|neurotic]] or [[paranoid]]  behavior – focusing on the worst possible outcome, however unlikely, or thinking that a situation is unbearable or impossible when it is really just uncomfortable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author=John M.Grohol; PsyD |title=What is Catastrophizing? – Psych Central |url=http://psychcentral.com/lib/2007/what-is-catastrophizing/ |accessdate=1 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.outofthefog.net/CommonBehaviors/Catastrophizing.html|title=Catastrophizing|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Münchausen syndrome by proxy===
{{Main|Münchausen syndrome by proxy}}
Münchausen syndrome by proxy is a controversial term for a behavior pattern in which a [[caregiver]] deliberately exaggerates, fabricates, or induces physical, psychological, behavioral, or mental health problems in those who are in their care.&lt;ref name="MBPBasics"&gt;{{cite web |last=Lasher |first=Louisa |url=http://www.mbpexpert.com/basics.htm |title=MBP Definitions, Maltreatment Behaviors, and Comments |accessdate=30 January 2012 |year=2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812034655/http://www.mbpexpert.com/basics.htm |archive-date=12 August 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alarmism==
{{Main|Alarmism}}
Alarmism is excessive or exaggerated alarm about a real or imagined [[threat]] e.g. the increases in deaths from [[infectious disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/xu472710j0670176/ |title=Alarmism is an infectious disease |journal=Society |doi=10.1007/BF02912206 |volume=34 |author=David Murray, Joel Schwartz |issue=4 |pages=35 |date=May 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The alarmist person is subject to the [[cognitive distortion]] of catastrophizing – of always expecting the worst of possible futures.&lt;ref&gt;P. Gilbert, ''Overcoming Depression'' (1999) p. 88-90&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural manifestations==

===Humour===
[[File:Tippies-of-1796-caricature.jpg|thumb|left|Caricature from 1796, parodying the fashion of one or two feathers issuing vertically from a woman's headdress, and women's neo-classically influenced gown styles, which were new in England in 1796){{citation needed|date=June 2016}}]]

'Some theoreticians of the comic consider exaggeration to be a universal comic device'.&lt;ref&gt;Emil Draitser, ''Techniques of Satire'' (1994) p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; It may take different forms in different genres, but all rely on the fact that 'the easiest way to make things laughable is to exaggerate to the point of absurdity their salient traits'.&lt;ref&gt;M. Eastman/W. Fry, ''Enjoyment of Laughter'' (2008) p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Caricature====
{{Main|Caricature}}
A caricature can refer to a [[portrait]] that exaggerates or distorts the essence of a person or thing to create an easily identifiable visual likeness: 'disproportionately increasing and emphasizing the defects of the features'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Filippo Baldinucci]], quoted in Harold Osborne ed., ''The Oxford Companion to Art'' (Oxford 1992) p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; In literature, a caricature is a description of a person using exaggeration of some characteristics and oversimplification of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://contemporarylit.about.com/cs/literaryterms/g/caricature.htm|title=Literary Term Definition of Resolution|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Slapstick====
{{Main|Slapstick}}
Slapstick is the recourse to humor involving exaggerated physical activity which exceeds the boundaries of common sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/slapstick |title=slapstick - definition of slapstick by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/encyclopedia/Romantic-Comedy-Yugoslavia/Slapstick-Comedy.html |title=Slapstick Comedy - film, cinema |publisher=Filmreference.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Slapstick+comedy |title=Slapstick comedy definition of Slapstick comedy in the Free Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; These exaggerated depictions are often found in cartoons, and light film comedies aimed at younger audiences.

====Paradoxical laughter====
{{Main|Paradoxical laughter}}
Paradoxical laughter is an exaggerated expression of humor which is unwarranted by external events. It may be uncontrollable laughter which may be recognised as inappropriate by the person involved. Freud considered 'the compulsive laughter which so often occurs on mournful occasions'&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Case Studies II'' (PFL 9) p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; the by-product of ambivalence.

====Miles Gloriosus====
[[Image:1600spanishcapitano.jpg|thumb|[[Il Capitano]] uses bravado and excessive shows of manliness to hide his true cowardly nature.]]
{{Main|Miles Gloriosus}}
The boastful soldier or Miles Gloriosus has for thousands of years formed part of the Western stage. 'The original ''miles gloriosus'' in [[Plautus]] is a son of Jove and Venus who has killed an elephant with his fist and seven thousand men in one day's fighting. In other words, he is trying to put on a good show: the exuberance of his boasting helps to put the play over'.&lt;ref&gt;Northrop Frye, ''Anatomy of Criticism'' (Princeton 1973) p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Overacting===
{{Main|Overacting}}
Overacting is the exaggeration of [[gesture]]s and speech when [[acting]]. It may be unintentional, particularly in the case of a bad [[actor]], or be required for the role. For the latter, it is commonly used in comical situations or to stress the [[evil]] characteristics of a [[villain]]. Since the perception of acting quality differs between people the extent of overacting can be subjective.

===Animation===
Exaggeration is an effect especially useful for [[animation]], as perfect imitation of reality can look static and dull in cartoons.&lt;ref name="AT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animationtoolworks.com/library/article9.html|title=12 Principles|last=Lightfoot|first=Nataha|publisher=Animation Toolworks|accessdate=June 27, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609091550/http://www.animationtoolworks.com/library/article9.html|archive-date=9 June 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The level of exaggeration depends on whether one seeks realism or a particular style, like a caricature or the style of a specific artist. The classical definition of exaggeration, employed by [[Disney]], was to remain true to reality, just presenting it in a wilder, more extreme form.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston &amp; Thomas (1981), p. 65-6.&lt;/ref&gt; Other forms of exaggeration can involve the supernatural or surreal, alterations in the physical features of a character; or elements in the storyline itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/BSoD/Introduction_to_the_Principles_of_Animation/Principles/Exaggeration|title=Exaggeration|last=Willian|date=June 29, 2006|publisher=Blender|accessdate=June 28, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207202658/http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/BSoD/Introduction_to_the_Principles_of_Animation/Principles/Exaggeration|archive-date=7 February 2009|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to employ a certain level of restraint when using exaggeration.  If a scene contains several elements, there should be a balance in how those elements are exaggerated in relation to each other, to avoid confusing or overawing the viewer.&lt;ref name="PoA E"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.evl.uic.edu/ralph/508S99/exaggera.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010413033041/http://www.evl.uic.edu/ralph/508S99/exaggera.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=13 April 2001|title=Exaggeration|last=De Stefano|first=Ralph A|publisher=Electronic Visualization Laboratory, [[University of Illinois at Chicago]]|accessdate=June 28, 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shock jock===
{{Main|Shock jock}}
A shock jock is a type of [[radio]] broadcaster or [[disc jockey]] who entertains listeners or attracts attention using [[humor]] and/or [[melodrama]]tic exaggeration that some portion of the listening audience may find offensive.

===Tragedy===
[[File:Hamlet William Morris Hunt.jpeg|thumb|Portrait of ''[[Prince Hamlet|Hamlet]]'', by [[William Morris Hunt]]]]
Although the boaster (alazon) is primarily a comic figure, 'the ''alazon'' may be one aspect of the [[tragic]] hero as well: the touch of ''miles gloriosus'' in [[Tamburlaine (play)|Tamburlaine]], even in [[Othello (character)|Othello]], is unmistakable, as is the touch of the obsessed philosopher in [[Faust]]us and [[Prince Hamlet|Hamlet]]'.&lt;ref&gt;Frye, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expressionism===
{{Main|Expressionism}}
'"Expressionist art"...attempted to intensify the expression of feeling and attitude by exaggeration'.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Bloom, ''Thomas Hardy'' (2010) p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; In its wake, even the 'new and hard [[New Objectivity|realism]]...kept much of the distortion and exaggeration which had been one of the chief devices of earlier Expressionism'.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Osborne ed., ''The Oxford Companion to Art'' (Oxford 1992) p. 397.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literary analogues===
* In the [[BookWorld]], warnings are issued about {{'}}'''Poetry Island'''...any visit longer than a few hours will have an ''exaggerating'' effect on the senses. Upbeat poems will tend to have you laughing uncontrollably, while sombre poems will have you questioning your own worth in a most hideously self-obsessed manner'.&lt;ref&gt;Jasper Fforde, ''One of Our Thursdays is Missing'' (London 2011) p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Monty Python]] [[Dirty Fork]] sketch demonstrates an absurd level of catastrophization where restaurant staff commit suicide and murder each other because of a customer complaint of a dirty fork. Compare with the scene in the film ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]'' involving the [[Black Knight (Monty Python)|Black Knight character]] which is the opposite extreme of absurdity ([[Minimisation (psychology)|minimisation]]).

'''Graphic violence''' is the depiction of especially vivid, brutal and realistic acts of [[violence in the media|violence]] in visual media such as [[literature]], [[film]], [[television]], and [[video game]]s. It may be real, simulated [[live action]], or [[animated]].

The "graphic" in graphic violence is a synonym for "explicit", referring to the clear and unabashed nature of the violence portrayed; this is what differentiates true graphic violence from lesser forms of violence in media productions, including "real" violence, "cartoon" violence and "fantasy" violence.

==Media==
Graphic violence generally consists of any clear and uncensored depiction of various violent acts. Commonly included depictions include murder, assault with a deadly weapon, accidents which result in death or severe injury, suicide, and torture. In all cases, it is the explicitness of the violence and the injury inflicted which results in it being labeled "graphic". In fictional depictions, appropriately realistic plot elements are usually included to heighten the sense of realism (i.e. [[Blood squirt|blood effects]], [[Troy weapon|prop weapon]]s, [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]]). In order to qualify for the "graphic" designation, the violence depicted must generally be of a particularly unmitigated and unshielded nature; an example would be a video of a man being shot by me, bleeding from the wound, and crumpling to the ground calling for his mother.

Graphic violence arouses strong emotions, ranging from titillation and excitement to utter revulsion and even terror, depending on the mindset of the viewer and the method in which it is presented. A certain degree of graphic violence has become ''de rigueur'' in adult "action" genre, and it is presented in an amount and manner carefully deliberated to excite the emotions of the target demographic without inducing disgust or revulsion. Even more extreme and grotesque acts of graphic violence (generally revolving around mutilation) are often used in the horror genre in order to inspire even stronger emotions of fear and shock (which the viewing demographic would presumably be seeking).

It is a highly controversial topic. Many believe that exposure to graphic violence leads to [[desensitization (psychology)|desensitization]] to committing acts of violence in person. It has led to [[censorship]] in extreme cases, and regulation in others. One notable case was the creation of the US [[Entertainment Software Rating Board]] in 1994. Many nations now require varying degrees of approval from television, movie, and software rating boards before a work can be released to the public.

On the other hand, some critics claim that watching violent media content can be cathartic, providings "acceptable outlets for anti-social impulses."&lt;ref name="bruder"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gradnet.de/papers/pomo2.archives/pomo98.papers/mtbruder98.htm |title= Aestheticizing Violence, or How To Do Things with Style |accessdate=2007-06-08 |last= Bruder |first= Margaret Ervin |year= 1998 |publisher= Film Studies, Indiana University, Bloomington IN |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20040908094032/http://www.gradnet.de/papers/pomo2.archives/pomo98.papers/mtbruder98.htm |archivedate= 2004-09-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film===
Graphic violence is used frequently in [[horror film|horror]], [[action film|action]], and [[crime film]]s. Several of these films were banned from certain countries for their violence. The [[snuff film]] takes horror to its furthest extreme as [[torture]] and murder are not simulated.

Violence in films is not an old topic, recently a study presented in an annual American Academy of Pediatrics conference showed that the "good guys" in superhero movies were on average more violent than the villains, potentially sending a strongly negative message to young viewers.[https://www.thenewstribe.com/2018/11/03/good-guys-more-violent-than-bad-ones-in-superhero-films-study/] 

==News media==
[[News media]] on television and online video frequently cover violent acts. The coverage may be preceded with a warning, stating that the footage may be disturbing to some viewers.

Sometimes graphic images are censored, by blurring or blocking a portion of the image, cutting the violent portions out of an image sequence or by removing certain portions of film footage from viewing. However, more and more throughout the years, it has been a ploy for media companies to attract more and more viewers by trivializing various events like the ones mentioned above for shock appeal.

==Music videos==
Graphic and gory violence has started appearing in [[music video]]s in recent times, an example being the controversial music video for the song "[[Rock DJ]]" by British rock vocalist [[Robbie Williams]], which features self-mutilation. Another example of a music video containing strong violence is the music video for the song "[[Hurricane (Thirty Seconds to Mars song)|Hurricane]]" by American rock band [[Thirty Seconds to Mars]] and "[[Happiness in Slavery]]" by American industrial rock group [[Nine Inch Nails]]. The music video for "[[Monolith of Inhumanity|Forced Gender Reassignment]]" by American [[deathgrind]] band [[Cattle Decapitation]] displays such intense graphic violence that it is not hosted by many popular video hosting sites like [[YouTube]] and [[Dailymotion]] and is only hosted by [[Bloody Disgusting]].

==Video games==
Violent content has been a central part of [[video game controversy]]. Because violence in video games is interactive and not passive, critics such as [[Dave Grossman (author)|Dave Grossman]] and [[Jack Thompson (attorney)|Jack Thompson]] argue that violence in games hardens children to unethical acts, calling [[first-person shooter]] games "murder simulators", although no conclusive evidence has supported this belief.

An example is the display of "[[Gib (video gaming)|gibs]]" (short for giblets&lt;ref&gt;Mahood, Andy, [http://uk.pc.gamespy.com/pc/half-life-2/682881p1.html Modify - Issue 12: Half-Life 2 on Steroids (PC)] ''GameSpy'', Jan. 26, 2006, Retrieved on Feb 27 2008&lt;/ref&gt;), little bits or giant chunks of [[internal organ]]s, [[flesh]], and [[bone]], when a character is killed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.pc.ign.com/mail/1999-07-28.html Reply to Letter to the Editor], ''IGN'', Jul 28, 1999, Retrieved Feb 27 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internet==
On the internet, several sites dedicated to recordings of real graphic violence, referred to as "gore", exist, such as [[Bestgore.com]] and [[Goregrish.com]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://globalnews.ca/news/1617578/luka-magnottas-gore-video-why-is-the-court-seeing-it/ |title=Luka Magnotta’s gore video: Why is the court seeing it? |last1=Minsky |first1=Amy|date=16 October 2014 |website= |publisher= |access-date=28 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/luka-magnotta-trial-jury-watches-infamous-video-1.2800822 |title=Luka Magnotta trial: Jury watches 'infamous' video |last1=Shivji|first1=Salimah |date=16 October 2014 |website= |publisher= |access-date=28 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, many content-aggregator sites such as [[Reddit]] or [[imageboard]]s and [[4chan]] have their own subsites which are dedicated to or allow that kind of content. Some of those sites also require that gore material to be marked as it, often by the [[internet slang]] "[[Not safe for life|NSFL]]" ([[shorthand]] for "not safe for life"). This kind of media might depict reality footage of war, car crashes and other accidents, decapitations, suicide, terrorism, murder, or executions. &lt;!-- [[LiveLeak]] --&gt;

An '''honor system''' or '''honesty system'''  is a philosophical way of running a variety of endeavors based on [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]], [[Honour|honor]], and [[honesty]]. Something that operates under the rule of the "honor system" is usually something that does not have strictly enforced rules governing its principles. In [[British English]], it would more often be called a '''"trust system"''' and should not be confused with the [[Orders, decorations, and medals of the United Kingdom|British honours system]].

The '''honor system''' is also a system granting freedom from customary surveillance (as to students or prisoners) with the understanding that those who are so freed will be bound by their [[honor]] to observe regulations (e.g. prison farms are operated under the '''''honor system'''''),&lt;ref&gt;"honor system." Webster's Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged. Merriam-Webster, 2002. http://unabridged.merriam-webster.com (24 Feb. 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; and will therefore not abuse the trust placed in them.

A person engaged in an honor system has a strong negative concept of breaking or going against it. The negatives may include community shame, loss of status, loss of a personal sense of integrity and pride or in extreme situations, banishment from one's community.

==Types of honor systems==
There are various types of honor systems that may be employed. A total honor system makes no checks on its users to verify their honesty, thereby easily allowing the system to be cheated. Though the system may face occasional audits, there would be no way thereafter of learning the identity of the violator. Some are simply contingent upon the truthfulness presumed of users; others are present when the losses caused by those who may cheat the system are less costly than a higher security system.

Other honor systems employ random checks of selected users to ensure they are in compliance. A minority of users will undergo this check, while the remainder will be given a chance to get away with a violation. In these cases, the management of the system hopes that the fear of getting checked will coerce users into compliance.

== Examples ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Honor bar]] --&gt;

=== Transport ===
In some places, [[public transport]] such as [[train]]s, [[tram]]s and/or buses operate on an honor system called [[proof-of-payment]].  The local government authorities may find it impractical or overly expensive to install ticket-checking [[turnstile]]s at every [[railway station|station]], and instead rely on casual human surveillance to check if all riders possess tickets.  In such a system one could thus ride the train or bus without paying, and simply hope to be lucky enough to avoid a random ticket check during the trip.  Such behavior is impossible for an honor system by itself to prevent. High penalties tend to be used to offset the financial cost of non-paying riders.

Some toll roads, including the [[Sawgrass Expressway]] near [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]], have unstaffed [[Toll house|toll booth]]s in which motorists are expected to pay their tolls. When a violation occurs, an alarm may sound, and the vehicle may be photographed, but {{cnspan|text=no officers will pursue the violator|date=November 2015}}.


At many Western airports, arriving international passengers are instructed by signs either to walk through one door (usually green) if they have nothing to declare, or a different door (usually red) if they have something to declare. Forcible screening is rare, though customs officers generally have authority to check persons suspected of falsely using the green channel. Items that must be declared commonly include cash, food, alcohol, luxury items, publications, weapons, tobacco, etc. Most other items, including personal belongings such as regular clothing, need not be declared. However, X-ray scans can reveal what items must be declared. {{cn|date=June 2017}}

=== Tourism ===
[[File:The Honor System.jpg|thumb|right|The honor system is used at [[Benicia State Recreation Area]].]]
Some hotels, mostly in [[continental Europe]], operate an [[honesty bar]], allowing guests to serve and record their own drinks and saving the cost of a night bartender. Patrons could theoretically lie about their drink consumption, and the hotel would have only limited powers to verify their claims. The concept of hotel "[[mini-bar]]s" in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] is similar, although the stock is quantified more carefully, making it difficult to lie. As well, most hotel minibars are now equipped with sensors which connect directly with the billing authority, making the honor system unnecessary.

In the [[Southern California]]n recreational [[sport fishing]] industry, the honor system is widely used, particularly on open party fishing boats. When the cook is occupied or in his bunk, passengers are permitted to get drinks and snacks on their own, providing they mark their own galley [[Bill (payment)|tab]].

Many publicly funded [[museum]]s and [[art galleries]] around the world ask for a certain "suggested donation" in exchange for admission. Patrons are almost never supervised during their donations, so there is no way of making sure the suggested minimum is being paid.  Strictly speaking this is not an honor system, as no payment obligation actually exists (merely a suggested donation); a true honor system is one in which there is an obligation, but it is not enforced.  However, these "suggested donation" schemes are often regarded as similar to an honor system, because they rely on the goodwill of patrons rather than the force of law.

[[National Park|National]] and [[State park]]s and some private parks often use an honor system to collect their admission fees. Rather than having a manned booth, they have a drop box known as an [[honesty box]] where money can be inserted, either directly, or in an envelope. Sometimes, the envelope contains a stub that is removed and placed on the guest's vehicle.

A lot of land [[International border]]s do not thoroughly check all persons passing the [[border checkpoint|checkpoint]]s for [[passport|required documents]] or [[contraband]]. When the security threat at the crossing is perceived by the nation's government to be low, checks may be conducted only on random persons or vehicles.

=== Education ===
{{main article|Academic honor code}}
The first honor system in America was penned by [[Thomas Jefferson]] at the [[College of William and Mary]], Jefferson's ''alma mater''.  In some colleges, the honor system is used to administer tests unsupervised. Students are generally asked to sign an [[honor code]] statement that says they will not cheat or use unauthorized resources when taking the test.  As an example, at [[Vanderbilt University]] students taking examinations are required to sign and include the following pledge: "On my honor as a student I have neither given nor received aid on this examination". Any student caught in violation of the Honor Code is referred to the Honor Council which investigates and determines the appropriate action, which can range from failing the course to expulsion from the University. At the [[University of Virginia]] a student taking an examination is also required to sign a pledge not to give or receive aid and there is but one penalty for transgression of the honor code, and that is dismissal from the University. Texas A&amp;M also has an Honor System which states, Aggies do not lie, cheat or steal or tolerate those who do. This is listed at the beginning of all tests. Any student that does not follow the code is remanded to the Honor council so they can determine the severity of the case and how the student should be punished or if expulsion is necessary.  The students at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] also maintain a student-run honor system.  Students maintain the integrity of the university by pledging not to cheat, steal or lie.  Unlike the University of Virginia, the honor system at Chapel Hill allows for different sanctions, ranging from probation to expulsion. A single-sanction Honor Code exists at the [[Virginia Military Institute]], where a "drum out" ceremony is still carried out upon a cadet's dismissal.

[[Washington and Lee University]] maintains an Honor System that was introduced by General [[Robert E. Lee]], who stated "We have but one rule here, and it is that every student must be a gentleman." The Washington &amp; Lee Honor System is entirely administered through the student body. It is one of the few universities in the [[United States]] to have a non-codified system. As a result, students decide what constitutes a breach of honor. These breaches are commonly named as lying, cheating, or stealing, but what constitutes an honor violation is open to the interpretation of the current student body. A single sanction of dismissal is enforced when a student is found guilty of an honor violation.

The [[California Institute of Technology]] implements an honor code that states "No member of the Caltech community shall take unfair advantage of any other member of the Caltech community."  Applications of this code range from professors trusting the students not to cheat with unsupervised take-home exams, laptops and bikes left unsecured in the dormitory lounges and courtyards (though the lounges and courtyards are secured against people who are not members of the Caltech community), and the food service trusting the students not to conduct food-hoarding raids during open kitchen hours.  The primary enforcement of the Caltech Honor Code is through student-run councils, but a few members of the Caltech faculty are involved.

=== Crime and justice ===

Some lower security [[Incarceration|inmate]]s at [[prison]]s are granted [[furlough]]s and allowed to temporarily leave the boundaries of the penitentiary for various reasons with the expectation they will return voluntarily when due without absconding. The reasons for departure may be for employment, education, recreation, or attending family events (such as [[wedding]]s or [[funeral]]s).

=== Non-profit ===
Another example can be seen in fundraising drives. Many [[charities]] distribute boxes of [[confectionery]] to businesses, which are placed in waiting rooms or similar for people to purchase items from. The confectionery is free to be removed by anyone who wishes to take it, and there is no enforcing of payment other than through the expectation of [[honesty]]. Indeed, most such boxes of confectionery bear the comment ''Your honesty is appreciated'' near where money is deposited.

In many places of [[worship]], those partaking in events with compulsory fees are expected to pay their dues, though most institutions such as these do not enforce payment. There is a general assumption of trust in most religious settings.

=== Retail ===
[[File:Martin's EasyShop system.jpg|right|thumb|200px|These handheld scanning devices at [[Giant-Carlisle#Martin's|Martin's]] allow customers to scan their own groceries while shopping. Such activity is not closely monitored by employees, and is therefore an honor system. Martin's has not reported an increase in shoplifting since introducing the system.]]
[[File:Gandhigiri Shop.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Example of the honor system at an unmanned Gandhigiri Shop in Mumbai, India]]

Some [[supermarket]] chains allow customers to scan their own groceries with handheld [[barcode reader]]s while placing them in their own carts (see [[self-checkout]]). While the system gives customers the ability to place groceries in their bags without paying, and customers can be randomly audited, participating supermarkets have reported that this experimental system has not increased the amount of [[shoplifting]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19276534/ Wait in self-check line? That’s so last month - U.S. business - MSNBC.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many hardware superstores, including [[Home Depot]], allow customers to place small items, such as [[screw]]s, into bags, then label the bags along with the exact price and quantity of the item they are purchasing. The system, which can be easily cheated, is contingent upon the honesty of customers, and is labeled in many stores as an "honor system."

In some countries, farmers leave bags of produce beside the road outside their houses with prices affixed. Passers-by pay by leaving cash in a container. In [[Ireland]], [[New Zealand]], [[Australia]] and the [[United Kingdom]] this is called the [[honesty box]] system. In other countries, small unmanned stores are run, where customers are able to enter, obtain what they need, and pay the bill in a secure container.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Basu|first=Mihika|title=Unmanned Shop|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/unmanned-shop/913972|publisher=Indian Express|accessdate=28 October 2012}}{{dead link|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sports===
In the sport of [[airsoft]], players rely on an honor system to tell whether or not an opponent is hit, because unlike [[paintballs]], airsoft pellets leave no visible markings on clothing.

Two combat sports practiced by the [[Society for Creative Anachronism]], [[SCA Armored Combat|Armored Combat]] and [[SCA fencing|Rapier Combat]], use an honor system to judge valid strikes.  The individual who is hit is responsible for acknowledging if the impact was valid.

[[Ultimate (sport)|Disc ultimate]] has historically relied on the honor system and encodes it as part of the “Spirit of the Game,” to the point where very few competitions use referees and players are allowed to call fouls on their opponents.

Sports that deliberately incorporate alternative sexualities, by necessity, rely on the honor system for enforcement. The [[National Gay Flag Football League]] limits heterosexual competition to 20% of a team's roster. [[Muggle quidditch]] requires a minimum number of players to be of a second gender, while allowing players to identify as any number of [[gender identity|gender identities]] to qualify under the rule.

==Advantages==
In many places where an honor system is used, it has been found to be cost-effective. Many businesses and organizations using an honor system have determined that the cost of maintaining staff to enforce proper payment outweighs the losses caused by the percentage of the population who are willing to cheat the system. In addition, efficiency is high when an honor system is used. For example, buses/trains do not have to wait to sell or check passenger tickets when boarding and can instead leave immediately, and customs green channels allow for much faster exits than if every passenger is routinely checked.

For the remainder of the population, the honor system gives a more welcoming feeling to customers. Those who are treated with trust may be more likely to return to the location, and thereby increase the amount of business.

==Criticism of the concept==
Deciding whether or not to obey an honor system can be a [[dilemma]], especially if one places his/her personal financial [[self-interest]] above the interest of the institution they are patronizing. This can lead to a future negative impact towards their personal financial self-interest. Honor systems are often criticized for promoting laziness and bad behavior. Some have suggested it is [[paradox]]ical to ask people to obey a law if there is no apparent law.

They do so by regulating and controlling information in social interaction.&lt;ref name= Piwinger&gt;{{Cite book | last=Piwinger | first= Manfred | last2=Ebert | first2= Helmut | year=2001 | chapter=Impression Management: Wie aus Niemand Jemand wird| title=in: Bentele, Guenther et al.

At an important game, a player would want to showcase themselves in the best light possible, because there are college recruiters watching. This person would have the flashiest pair of cleats and try and perform their best to show off their skills. Their main goal may be to impress the college recruiters in a way that maximizes their chances of being chosen for a college team rather than winning the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://education-portal.com/academy/lesson/impression-management-in-sociology-theory-definition-examples.html#lesson|title=Impression Management in Sociology: Theory, Definition &amp; Examples|website=Study.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Impression management is usually used synonymously with [[Self-concept|self]]-presentation, in which a person tries to influence the perception of their image. The notion of impression management was first applied to [[face-to-face communication]], but then was expanded to apply to [[computer-mediated communication]]. The concept of impression management is applicable to academic fields of study such as psychology and sociology as well as practical fields such as corporate communication and media.

== Background ==
The foundation and the defining principles of impression management were created by Erving Goffman in ''[[The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life]]''. Impression management theory states that one tries to alter one's perception according to one's goals. In other words, the theory is about how individuals wish to present themselves, but in a way that satisfies their needs and goals. Goffman "proposed to focus on how people in daily work situations present themselves and, in so doing, what they are doing to others", and he was "particularly interested in how a person guides and control how others form an impression of them and what a person may or may not do while performing before them".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Theory ==

=== Motives ===
A range of factors that govern impression management can be identified. It can be stated that impression management becomes necessary whenever there exists a kind of social situation, whether real or imaginary. Logically, the awareness of being a potential subject of monitoring is also crucial. Furthermore, the characteristics of a given social situation are important. Specifically, the surrounding [[cultural norms]] determine the appropriateness of particular nonverbal behaviours.&lt;ref&gt;Kamau, C. (2009) Strategising impression management in corporations: cultural knowledge as capital. In D. Harorimana (Ed) Cultural implications of knowledge sharing, management and transfer: identifying competitive advantage. Chapter 4. Information Science Reference. {{ISBN|978-1-60566-790-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actions have to be appropriate to the targets, and within that culture, so that the kind of audience as well as the relation to the audience influences the way impression management is realized. A person's goals are another factor governing the ways and strategies of impression management. This refers to the content of an assertion, which also leads to distinct ways of presentation of aspects of the self. The degree of self-efficacy describes whether a person is convinced that it is possible to convey the intended impression.&lt;ref&gt;Doering 1999, p. 261-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

A new study finds that, all other things being equal, people are more likely to pay attention to faces that have been associated with negative gossip than those with neutral or positive associations.
The study contributes to a body of work showing that far from being objective, human perceptions are shaped by unconscious brain processes that determine what they "choose" to see or ignore—even before they  become aware of it. The findings also add to the idea that the brain evolved to be particularly sensitive to "bad guys" or cheaters—fellow humans who undermine social life by deception, theft or other non-cooperative behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 21596956 | doi=10.1126/science.1201574 | volume=332 | issue=6036 | title=The visual impact of gossip. | date=Jun 2011 | journal=Science | pages=1446–8 | pmc=3141574 | last1 = Anderson | first1 = E | last2 = Siegel | first2 = EH | last3 = Bliss-Moreau | first3 = E | last4 = Barrett | first4 = LF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many methods behind self-presentation, including [[self disclosure]] (identifying what makes you "you" to another person), managing appearances (trying to fit in), ingratiation, aligning actions (making one's actions seem appealing or understandable), and alter-casting (imposing identities on other people). These self-presentation methods can also be used on the corporate level as impression management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisegeek.org/what-is-impression-management.htm|title=What is Impression Management?|website=wiseGEEK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Self-presentation  ===

Self-presentation is conveying information about oneself – or an image of oneself – to others. There are two types and motivations of self-presentation:
* presentation meant to match one's own self-image, and
* presentation meant to match audience expectations and preferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baumeister|first1=Roy F.|title=Self-Presentation Theory: Self-Construction and Audience Pleasing|journal=Springer Series in Social Psychology|date=1987|volume=Theories of Group Behavior}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-presentation is expressive. Individuals construct an image of themselves to claim personal identity, and present themselves in a manner that is consistent with that image.{{sfn|Schlenker|1980|p=37}} If they feel like it is restricted, they often exhibit [[reactance (psychology)|reactance]] or become defiant – try to assert their freedom against those who would seek to curtail self-presentation expressiveness. An example of this dynamic is the "preacher's daughter", whose suppressed personal identity and emotions cause an eventual backlash at her family and community.

* '''Boasting''' – [[Theodore Millon|Millon]] notes that in self-presentation individuals are challenged to balance boasting against discrediting themselves via excessive self-promotion or being caught and being proven wrong. Individuals often have limited ability to perceive how their efforts impact their acceptance and likeability by others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Millon|first1=Theodore|title=Handbook of Psychology, Personality and Social Psychology|date=2003|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-471-38404-5|page=337}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Flattery''' – [[Flattery]] or [[praise]] to increase social attractiveness{{sfn|Schlenker|1980|p=169}}
* '''Intimidation''' aggressively showing [[anger]] to get others to hear and obey one's demands.&lt;ref&gt;Felson 1984, p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-presentation can be either defensive or assertive strategies. Whereas defensive strategies include behaviours like avoidance of threatening situations or means of [[self-handicapping]], [[assertive]] strategies refer to more active behaviour like the verbal idealisation of the self, the use of status symbols or similar practices.&lt;ref&gt;Piwinger; Ebert 2001, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

These strategies play important roles in one's maintenance of [[self-esteem]].&lt;ref&gt;Leary; Kowalski 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; One's self-esteem is affected by their evaluation of their own performance and their perception of how others react to their performance. As a result, people actively portray impressions that will elicit self-esteem enhancing reactions from others.&lt;ref&gt;Hass 1981&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social interaction ===
Goffman argued in his 1967 book, ''Interaction ritual'', that people participate in social interactions by performing a "line", or "pattern of verbal and nonverbal acts", which is created and maintained by both the performer and the audience.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Interaction ritual: Essays on face-to-face behavior|last=Goffman|first=E.|publisher=Aldine|year=1967|isbn=|location=Chicago|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By enacting a line effectively, the person gains positive social value, which is also called "face". The success of a social interaction will depend on whether the performer has the ability to maintain face.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; As a result, a person is required to display a kind of character by becoming "someone who can be relied upon to maintain himself as an interactant, poised for communication, and to act so that others do not endanger themselves by presenting themselves as interactants to him".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Goffman analyses how a human being in "ordinnary work situations presents himself and his activity to others, the ways in which he guides and controls the impression they form of him, and the kinds of things he may and may not do while sustaining his performance before them”.&lt;ref&gt;Goffman, 1959, p.8&lt;/ref&gt;

When Goffman turned to focus on people physically presented in a social interaction, the "social dimension of impression management certainly extends beyond the specific place and time of engagement in the organization". Impression management is "a social activity that has individual and community implications".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; We call it "pride" when a person displays a good showing from duty to himself, while we call it "honor" when he "does so because of duty to wider social units, and receives support from these duties in doing so".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Another approach to moral standards that Goffman pursues is the notion of "rules of conduct", which "can be partially understood as obligations or moral constraints". These rules may be substantive (involving laws, morality, and ethics) or ceremonial (involving etiquette).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Rules of conduct play an important role when a relationship "is asymmetrical and the expectations of one person toward another are hierarchical."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Dramaturgical analogy ===
Goffman presented impression management [[Dramaturgy (sociology)|dramaturgically]], explaining the motivations behind complex human performances within a social setting based on a play metaphor.&lt;ref&gt;Dillard et al., 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Goffman's work incorporates aspects of a symbolic [[Interactionism|interactionist]] perspective,{{sfn|Schlenker|1980|p=34}} emphasizing a qualitative analysis of the interactive nature of the communication process. Impression management requires the physical presence of others. Performers who seek certain ends in their interest, must "work to adapt their behavior in such a way as to give off the correct impression to a particular audience" and "implicitly ask that the audience take their performance seriously".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Goffman proposed that while among other people individual would always strive to control the impression that others form of him or her so that to achieve individual or social goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://sk.sagepub.com/Books/the-social-thought-of-erving-goffman|title=The Social Thought of Erving Goffman|last=Jacobsen|first=Michael|last2=Kristiansen|first2=Søren|date=2015|location=Thousand Oaks, California|doi=10.4135/9781483381725}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The actor, shaped by the environment and target audience, sees interaction as a performance. The objective of the performance is to provide the audience with an impression consistent with the desired goals of the actor.&lt;ref&gt;Barnhart, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, impression management is also highly dependent on the situation.&lt;ref&gt;Goffman 2006, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to these goals, individuals differ in responses from the interactive environment, some may be non-responsive to an audience's reactions while others actively respond to audience reactions in order to elicit positive results. These differences in response towards the environment and target audience are called [[self-monitoring theory|self-monitoring]].&lt;ref name="Doring"&gt;Döring 1999, p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt; Another factor in impression management is [[self-verification theory|self-verification]], the act of conforming the audience to the person's [[self-concept]].

The audience can be real or imaginary. IM style norms, part of the mental programming received through socialization, are so fundamental that we usually do not notice our expectations of them. While an actor (speaker) tries to project a desired image, an audience (listener) might attribute a resonant or discordant image. An example is provided by situations in which embarrassment occurs and threatens the image of a participant.&lt;ref&gt;Goffman 1956&lt;/ref&gt;

Goffman proposes that performers "can use dramaturgical discipline as a defense to ensure that the 'show' goes on without interruption."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Goffman contends that dramaturgical discipline includes:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
# coping with dramaturgical contingencies;
# demonstrating intellectual and emotional involvement;
# remembering one's part and not committing unmeant gestures or faux pas;
# not giving away secrets involuntarily;
# covering up inappropriate behavior on the part of teammates on the spur of the moment;
# offering plausible reasons or deep apologies for disruptive events;
# maintaining self-control (for example, speaking briefly and modestly);
# suppressing emotions to private problems; and
# suppressing spontaneous feelings.

=== Manipulation and ethics ===
In business, "managing impressions" normally "involves someone trying to control the image that a significant stakeholder has of them". The ethics of impression management has been hotly debated on whether we should see it as an effective self-revelation or as cynical [[Psychological manipulation|manipulation]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Some people insist that impression management can reveal a truer version of the self by adopting the strategy of being '''transparent''', which is a kind of openness. Because [[Transparency (behavior)|transparency]] "can be provided so easily and because it produces information of value to the audience, it changes the nature of impression management from being cynically manipulative to being a kind of useful adaptation".

[[Virtue signalling]] is used within groups to criticize their own members for valuing outward appearance over substantive action (having a real or permanent, rather than apparent or temporary, existence).

[[Psychological manipulation]] is a type of [[social influence]] that aims to change the behavior or [[perception]] of others through [[abuse|abusive]], [[deceptive]], or underhanded tactics.&lt;ref name=braiker&gt;{{Cite book|title=Who's Pulling Your Strings ? How to Break The Cycle of Manipulation |first=Harriet B.|last=Braiker |year=2004 |isbn=0-07-144672-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; By advancing the interests of the manipulator, often at another's expense, such methods could be considered exploitative, abusive, devious, and deceptive.  The process of manipulation involves bringing an unknowing victim under the domination of the manipulator, often using deception, and using the victim to serve their own purposes.

[[Machiavellianism]] is a term that some social and personality psychologists use to describe a person's tendency to be unemotional, and therefore able to detach him or herself from conventional morality and hence to deceive and manipulate others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/sideways-view/201611/the-machiavellian-boss|title=The Machiavellian Boss|work=Psychology Today|date=November 18, 2016|author=Adrian Furnham}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See also [[Machiavellianism in the workplace]].)

[[Sophism]]
In modern usage sophist and sophistry are redefined and used disparagingly. A sophism is a '''specious''' argument for displaying ingenuity in reasoning or for deceiving someone. A sophist is a person who reasons with clever but fallacious and deceptive arguments.

[[Corporate jargon]]
Variously known as corporate speak, corporate lingo, business speak, business jargon, management speak, workplace jargon, or commercialese, is the jargon often used in large corporations, bureaucracies, and similar workplaces.[1][2] The use of corporate jargon, also known as "corporatese", is criticised for its lack of clarity as well as for its tedium, making meaning and intention opaque and understanding difficult.

== Application ==

=== Face-to-face communication ===

==== Self, social identity and social interaction ====
The social psychologist, Edward E. Jones, brought the study of impression management to the field of psychology during the 1960s and extended it to include people's attempts to control others' impression of their personal characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Leary; Kowalski 1990&lt;/ref&gt; His work sparked an increased attention towards impression management as a fundamental interpersonal process.

The concept of [[self]] is important to the theory of impression management as the images people have of themselves shape and are shaped by social interactions{{sfn|Schlenker|1980|p=47}} Our self-concept develops from social experience early in life.{{sfn|Schlenker|1980|p=85}} Schlenker (1980) further suggests that children anticipate the effect that their behaviours will have on others and how others will evaluate them. They control the impressions they might form on others, and in doing so they control the outcomes they obtain from social interactions.

[[Social identity]] refers to how people are defined and regarded in social interactions .{{sfn|Schlenker|1980|p=69}} Individuals use impression management strategies to influence the social identity they project to others.{{sfn|Schlenker|1980|p=85}} The identity that people establish influences their behaviour in front of others, others' treatment of them and the outcomes they receive. Therefore, in their attempts to influence the impressions others form of themselves, a person plays an important role in affecting his social outcomes.{{sfn|Schlenker|1980|p=90}}

Social interaction is the process by which we act and react to those around us. In a nutshell, social interaction includes those acts people perform toward each other and the responses they give in return.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://study.com/academy/lesson/social-interactions-definition-types-quiz.html|title=Social Interactions: Definition &amp; Types|last=Moffitt|first=Kimberly|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most basic function of self-presentation is to define the nature of a social situation (Goffman, 1959). Most social interactions are very role governed. Each person has a role to play, and the interaction proceeds smoothly when these roles are enacted effectively. People also strive to create impressions of themselves in the minds of others in order to gain material and social rewards (or avoid material and social punishments).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://faculty.washington.edu/jdb/452/452_chapter_07.pdf|title=CHAPTER 07 SELF-PRESENTATION|last=Brown|first=Jonathon|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cross-cultural communication   ====
Understanding how one's impression management behavior might be interpreted by others can also serve as the basis for smoother interactions and as a means for solving some of the most insidious communication problems among individuals of different racial/ethnic and gender backgrounds.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rosenfeld|first=Paul|last2=Giacalone|first2=Robert A.|last3=Riordan|first3=Catherine A.|date=1994-03-01|title=Impression Management Theory and Diversity Lessons for Organizational Behavior|url=http://abs.sagepub.com/content/37/5/601|journal=American Behavioral Scientist|language=en|volume=37|issue=5|pages=601–604|doi=10.1177/0002764294037005002|issn=0002-7642}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"People are sensitive to how they are seen by others and use many forms of impression management to compel others to react to them in the ways they wish" (Giddens, 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;142). An example of this concept is easily illustrated through cultural differences. Different cultures have diverse thoughts and opinions on what is considered beautiful or attractive. For example, Americans tend to find tan skin attractive, but in Indonesian culture, pale skin is more desirable.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.studentpulse.com/articles/553/impression-management-considering-cultural-social-and-spiritual-factors|title=Impression Management: Considering Cultural, Social, and Spiritual Factors|last=Norris|first=Ashley|date=2011|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another illustration of how people attempt to control how others perceive them is portrayed through the clothing they wear. A person who is in a leadership position strives to be respected and in order to control and maintain the impression. This illustration can also be adapted for a cultural scenario. The clothing people choose to wear says a great deal about the person and the culture they represent. For example, most Americans are not overly concerned with conservative clothing. Most Americans are content with tee shirts, shorts, and showing skin. The exact opposite is true on the other side of the world. "Indonesians are both modest and conservative in their attire" (Cole, 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;77).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Companies use [[cross-cultural training]] (CCT) to facilitate effective cross-cultural interaction. CCT can be defined as any procedure used to increase an individual's ability to cope with and work in a foreign environment. Training employees in culturally consistent and specific impression management (IM) techniques provide the avenue for the employee to consciously switch from an automatic, home culture IM mode to an IM mode that is culturally appropriate and acceptable. Second, training in IM reduces the uncertainty of interaction with FNs and increases employee's ability to cope by reducing unexpected events.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

==== Team-working in hospital wards   ====
Impression management theory can also be used in health communication. It can be used to explore how professionals 'present' themselves when interacting on hospital wards and also how they employ front stage and backstage settings in their collaborative work.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lewin|first=Simon|last2=Reeves|first2=Scott|date=2011-05-01|title=Enacting 'team' and 'teamwork': using Goffman's theory of impression management to illuminate interprofessional practice on hospital wards|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|volume=72|issue=10|pages=1595–1602|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2011.03.037|issn=1873-5347|pmid=21549467}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the hospital wards, Goffman's front stage and backstage performances are divided into 'planned' and 'ad hoc' rather than 'official' and 'unofficial' interactions.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Planned front stage is the structured collaborative activities such as ward rounds and care conferences which took place in the presence of patients and/or carers.

Ad hoc front stage is the unstructured or unplanned interprofessional interactions that took place in front of patients/carers or directly      involved patients/carers.

Planned backstage is the structured MDT meetings in which professionals gathered in a private area of the ward, in the absence of patients, to discuss management plans for patients under their care.

Ad hoc backstage is the use of corridors and other ward spaces for quick conversations between professionals in the absence of patients/carers.

Offstage is the social activities between and among professional groups/individuals outside of the hospital context.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Results show that interprofessional interactions in this setting are often based less on planned front stage activities than on ad hoc backstage activities. While the former may, at times, help create and maintain an appearance of collaborative interprofessional 'teamwork', conveying a sense of professional togetherness in front of patients and their families, they often serve little functional practice. These findings have implications for designing ways to improve interprofessional practice on acute hospital wards where there is no clearly defined interprofessional team, but rather a loose configuration of professionals working together in a collaborative manner around a particular patient. In such settings, interventions that aim to improve both ad hoc as well as planned forms of communication may be more successful than those intended to only improve planned communication.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Computer-mediated communication ===
The [[hyperpersonal model]] of [[computer-mediated communication]] (CMC) posits that users exploit the technological aspects of CMC in order to enhance the messages they construct to manage impressions and facilitate desired relationships. The most interesting aspect of the advent of CMC is how it reveals basic elements of interpersonal communication, bringing into focus fundamental processes that occur as people meet and develop relationships relying on typed messages as the primary mechanism of expression. "Physical features such as one's appearance and voice provide much of the information on which people base first impressions face-to-face, but such features are often unavailable in CMC. Various perspectives on CMC have suggested that the lack of nonverbal cues diminishes CMC's ability to foster impression formation and management, or argued impressions develop nevertheless, relying on language and content cues. One approach that describes the way that CMC's technical capacities work in concert with users' impression development intentions is the hyperpersonal model of CMC (Walther, 1996). As receivers, CMC users idealize partners based on the circumstances or message elements that suggest minimal similarity or desirability. As senders, CMC users selectively self-present, revealing attitudes and aspects of the self in a controlled and socially desirable fashion. The CMC channel facilitates editing, discretion, and convenience, and the ability to tune out environmental distractions and re-allocate cognitive resources in order to further enhance one's message composition. Finally, CMC may create dynamic feedback loops wherein the exaggerated expectancies are confirmed and reciprocated through mutual interaction via the bias-prone communication processes identified above."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walther|first=Joseph B.|date=2007-09-01|title=Selective self-presentation in computer-mediated communication: Hyperpersonal dimensions of technology, language, and cognition|url=http://isiarticles.com/bundles/Article/pre/pdf/38956.pdf|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|volume=23|issue=5|pages=2538–2557|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2006.05.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to O'Sullivan's (2000) impression management model of communication channels, individuals will prefer to use mediated channels rather than face-to-face conversation in face-threatening situations. Within his model, this trend is due to the channel features that allow for control over exchanged social information. The present paper extends O'Sullivan's model by explicating information control as a media affordance, arising from channel features and social skills, that enables an individual to regulate and restrict the flow of social information in an interaction, and present a scale to measure it. One dimension of the information control scale, expressive information control, positively predicted channel preference for recalled face-threatening situations. This effect remained after controlling for social anxiousness and power relations in relationships. O'Sullivan's model argues that some communication channels may help individuals manage this struggle and therefore be more preferred as those situations arise. It was based on an assumption that channels with features that allow fewer social cues, such as reduced nonverbal information or slower exchange of messages, invariably afford an individual with an ability to better manage the flow of a complex, ambiguous, or potentially difficult conversations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Feaster|first=John Christian|date=2010-10-01|title=Expanding the Impression Management Model of Communication Channels: An Information Control Scale|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1083-6101.2010.01535.x/abstract|journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|language=en|volume=16|issue=1|pages=115–138|doi=10.1111/j.1083-6101.2010.01535.x|issn=1083-6101}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals manage what information about them is known, or isn't known, to control other's impression of them. Anyone who has given the bathroom a quick cleaning when they anticipate the arrival of their mother-in-law (or date) has managed their impression. For an example from [[Information and communications technology|information and communication technology]] use, inviting someone to view a person's Webpage before a face-to-face meeting may predispose them to view the person a certain way when they actually meet.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C6eTAgAAQBAJ|title=Information and Communication Technologies in Action: Linking Theories and Narratives of Practice|last=Browning|first=Larry D.|last2=Saetre|first2=Alf Steinar|last3=Stephens|first3=Keri|last4=Sornes|first4=Jan-Oddvar|date=2010-09-28|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135889432|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Corporate brand ====
The impression management perspective offers potential insight into how corporate stories could build the corporate brand, by influencing the impressions that stakeholders form of the organization. The link between themes and elements of corporate stories and IM strategies/behaviours indicates that these elements will influence audiences' perceptions of the corporate brand.&lt;ref name="Sara Spear 491–501"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sara Spear|last2=Stuart Roper|date=2013-11-01|title=Using corporate stories to build the corporate brand: an impression management perspective|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JPBM-09-2013-0387|journal=Journal of Product &amp; Brand Management|volume=22|issue=7|pages=491–501|doi=10.1108/JPBM-09-2013-0387|issn=1061-0421}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Corporate storytelling =====
Corporate storytelling is suggested to help demonstrate the importance of the corporate brand to internal and external stakeholders, and create a position for the company against competitors, as well as help a firm to bond with its employees (Roper and Fill, 2012). The corporate reputation is defined as a stakeholder's perception of the organization (Brown et al., 2006), and Dowling (2006) suggests that if the story causes stakeholders to perceive the organization as more authentic, distinctive, expert, sincere, powerful, and likeable, then it is likely that this will enhance the overall corporate reputation.

Impression management theory is a relevant perspective to explore the use of corporate stories in building the corporate brand. The corporate branding literature notes that interactions with brand communications enable stakeholders to form an impression of the organization (Abratt and Keyn, 2012), and this indicates that IM theory could also therefore bring insight into the use of corporate stories as a form of communication to build the corporate brand. Exploring the IM strategies/behaviors evident in corporate stories can indicate the potential for corporate stories to influence the impressions that audiences form of the corporate brand.&lt;ref name="Sara Spear 491–501"/&gt;

===== Corporate document =====
Firms use more subtle forms of influencing outsiders' impressions of firm performance and prospects, namely by manipulating the content and presentation of information in corporate documents with the purpose of "distort[ing] readers" perceptions of corporate achievements" [Godfrey et al., 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;96]. In the accounting literature this is referred to as impression management. The opportunity for impression management in corporate reports is increasing. Narrative disclosures have become longer and more sophisticated over the last few years. This growing importance of descriptive sections in corporate documents provides firms with the opportunity to overcome information asymmetries by presenting more detailed information and explanation, thereby increasing their decision-usefulness. However, they also offer an opportunity for presenting financial performance and prospects in the best possible light, thus having the opposite effect. In addition to the increased opportunity for opportunistic discretionary disclosure choices, impression management is also facilitated in that corporate narratives are largely unregulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bangor.ac.uk/business/staff/doris_merkl-davies.php.en|title=Dr Doris Merkl-Davies  {{!}} Bangor Business School {{!}} Bangor University|last=University|first=Bangor|website=www.bangor.ac.uk|access-date=2016-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Media ====
The medium of communication influences the actions taken in impression management. Self-efficacy can differ according to the fact whether the trial to convince somebody is made through face-to-face-interaction or by means of an e-mail.&lt;ref name="Doring" /&gt; Communication via devices like telephone, e-mail or chat is governed by technical restrictions, so that the way people express personal features etc. can be changed. This often shows how far people will go.

===== Profiles on social networking sites =====
Social networking users will employ protective self-presentations for image management. Users will use subtractive and repudiate strategies to maintain a desired image.&lt;ref name="Rui, J 2013"&gt;Rui, J. and M. A. Stefanone (2013). Strategic Management of Other-Provided Information Online: Personality and Network Variables. System Sciences (HICSS), 2013 46th Hawaii International Conference on.&lt;/ref&gt; Subtractive strategy is used to untag an undesirable photo on Social Networking Sites. In addition to un-tagging their name, some users will request the photo to be removed entirely. Repudiate strategy is used when a friend posts an undesirable comment about the user. In response to an undesired post, users may add another wall post as an innocence defense. Michael Stefanone states that "self-esteem maintenance is an important motivation for strategic self-presentation online."&lt;ref name="Rui, J 2013" /&gt; Outside evaluations of their physical appearance, competence, and approval from others determines how social media users respond to pictures and wall posts. Unsuccessful self-presentation online can lead to rejection and criticism from social groups. Social networking sites like MySpace, Facebook, and StudiVZ are popular means of communicating personality. Recent theoretical and empirical considerations of homepages and Web 2.0 platforms show that impression management is a major motive for actively participating in social networking sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Krämer|first=Nicole C.|last2=Winter|first2=Stephan|date=2008-01-01|title=Impression Management 2.0|url=http://econtent.hogrefe.com/doi/abs/10.1027/1864-1105.20.3.106|journal=Journal of Media Psychology|volume=20|issue=3|pages=106–116|doi=10.1027/1864-1105.20.3.106|issn=1864-1105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Online social media presence often varies with respect to users' age, gender, and body weight. While men and women tend to utilize social media in comparable degrees, both uses and capabilities vary depending on individual preferences as well perceptions of power or dominance&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/908698924|title=Social media : enduring principles|last=Ashlee.|first=Humphreys,|isbn=9780199328437|location=Oxford|oclc=908698924}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In terms of performance, men tend to display characteristics associated with masculinity as well as more commanding language styles&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/908698924|title=Social media : enduring principles|last=Ashlee.|first=Humphreys,|isbn=9780199328437|location=Oxford|oclc=908698924}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In much the same way, women tend to present feminine self-depictions and engage in more supportive language&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/908698924|title=Social media : enduring principles|last=Ashlee.|first=Humphreys,|isbn=9780199328437|location=Oxford|oclc=908698924}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

With respect to usage across age variances, many children develop digital and social media literacy skills around 7 or 8 and begin to form online social relationships via virtual environments designed for their age group&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/908698924|title=Social media : enduring principles|last=Ashlee.|first=Humphreys,|isbn=9780199328437|location=Oxford|oclc=908698924}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The years between thirteen and fifteen demonstrate high social media usage that begins to become more balanced with offline interactions as teens learn to navigate both their online and in-person identities which may often diverge from one another&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/908698924|title=Social media : enduring principles|last=Ashlee.|first=Humphreys,|isbn=9780199328437|location=Oxford|oclc=908698924}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Social media platforms often provide a great degree of social capital during the college years and later&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/908698924|title=Social media : enduring principles|last=Ashlee.|first=Humphreys,|isbn=9780199328437|location=Oxford|oclc=908698924}}&lt;/ref&gt;. During middle adulthood, users tend to display greater levels of confidence and mastery in their social media connections while senior users tend to utilize social media for educational and supportive purposes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/908698924|title=Social media : enduring principles|last=Ashlee.|first=Humphreys,|isbn=9780199328437|location=Oxford|oclc=908698924}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These myriad factors influence how users will form and communicate their online personas.

Studies also suggest that adolescents body weight and their health status might influence their self-presentation practices. For example, research focusing on adolescent patients with obesity indicate that particularly girls with obesity tend to present themselves in such a way that their weight is not in focus, or avoid presenting food items that are associated with overweight/obesity &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holmberg|first=Christopher|last2=Berg|first2=Christina|last3=Hillman|first3=Thomas| last4=Lissner|first4=Lauren|last5=Chaplin|first5=John E.|date=2018-10-16|title= Self-presentation in digital media among adolescent patients with obesity: Striving for integrity, risk-reduction, and social recognition|url=  http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2055207618807603|journal=Digital Health|volume=4|pages=1–15|doi=10.1177/2055207618807603|}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

According to Marwick, social profiles create implications such as "context collapse" for presenting oneself to the audience. The concept of ‘‘context collapse,’’ suggests that social technologies make it difficult to vary self-presentation based on environment or audience. "Large sites such as Facebook and Twitter group friends, family members, coworkers, and acquaintances together under the umbrella term ‘‘friends’ "&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Online Identity|last=Marwick|first=Alice E.|publisher=Blackwell|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=355–364}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Political impression management =====
One arena where impression management is essential is in politics. "Political impression management" was coined in 1972 by sociologist Peter M. Hall, who defined the term as the art of making a candidate look electable and capable (Hall 1972). This is due in part to the importance of "presidential" candidates—appearance, image, and narrative are a key part of a campaign and thus impression management has always been a huge part of winning an election (Katz 2016). As social media becomes more and more a part of the political process, political impression management is becoming more challenging as the online image of the candidate often now lies in the hands of the voters themselves.

== Implications  ==
Impression management can distort the results of empirical research that relies on interviews and surveys, a phenomenon commonly referred to as "social desirability bias". Impression management theory nevertheless constitutes a field of research on its own.&lt;ref&gt;Tedeschi 1984&lt;/ref&gt;
When it comes to practical questions concerning public relations and the way organizations should handle their public image, the assumptions provided by impression management theory can also provide a framework.&lt;ref&gt;Piwinger; Ebert 2001, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

An examination of different impression management strategies acted out by individuals who were facing criminal trials where the trial outcomes could range from a death sentence, life in prison or acquittal has been reported in the forensic literature.&lt;ref&gt;Perri, Frank S. and Lichtenwald, Terrance G. (2010). "[http://www.all-about-forensic-psychology.com/support-files/female-psychopathic-killers.pdf The Last Frontier: Myths &amp; The Female Psychopathic Killer]". ''Forensic Examiner'', Summer 2010, 50-67.&lt;/ref&gt;
The Perri and Lichtenwald article examined female [[psychopathic]] killers, whom as a group were highly motivated to manage the impression that attorneys, judges, mental health professions and ultimately, a jury had of the murderers and the murder they committed. It provides legal case illustrations of the murderers combining and/or switching from one impression management strategy such as ingratiation or supplication to another as they worked towards their goal of diminishing or eliminating any accountability for the murders they committed.

Since the 1990s, researchers in the area of sport and exercise psychology have studied self-presentation.  Concern about how one is perceived has been found to be relevant to the study of athletic performance.  For example, anxiety may be produced when an athlete is in the presence of spectators.  Self-presentational concerns have also been found to be relevant to exercise.  For example, the concerns may elicit motivation to exercise.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Ginis, K.A., Lindwall, M., &amp; Prapavessis, H. (2007).  Who cares what other people think?  Self-presentation in exercise and sport.  In R. Eklund &amp; G. Tenenbaum (Eds.), Handbook of Sport Psychology (pp. 136–153).  Hoboken, NJ:  John Wiles &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent research investigating the effects of impression management on social behaviour showed that social behaviours (e.g. eating) can serve to convey a desired impression to others and enhance one's self-image. Research on eating has shown that people tend to eat less when they believe that they are being observed by others.&lt;ref&gt;Herman; Roth; Polivy 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

{{hatlink|For quality of information in a more general sense, see [[Information quality]].}}
'''Information quality''' ('''InfoQ''') is the potential of a [[data set]] to achieve a specific (scientific or practical) goal using a given [[Empirical research|empirical analysis method]].

== Definition ==
Formally, the definition is InfoQ = U(X,f|g) where X is the data, f the analysis method, g the goal and U the utility function. InfoQ is different from [[data quality]] and [[Efficiency (statistics)|analysis quality]], but is dependent on these components and on the relationship between them. 
   	
InfoQ has been applied in a wide range of domains like healthcare, customer surveys, data science programs, advanced manufacturing and Bayesian network applications.

Kenett and Shmueli (2014) proposed eight dimensions to help assess InfoQ and various methods for increasing InfoQ: Data resolution, [[Data structure]], Data integration, Temporal relevance, Chronology of data and goal, [[Generalization]], [[Operationalization]], Communication.

Isolation reduces the opportunity of the abused to be rescued or escape from the abuse. It also helps [[Destabilisation|disorientate]] the abused and makes the abused more dependent on the abuser. The degree of power and control over the abused is contingent upon the degree of his or her physical or emotional isolation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rand.org/pubs/papers/P3883.html |title=The Theory and Practice of Blackmail |publisher=RAND |date=1959-03-10 |accessdate=2016-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ryan Richard Thoreson |url=https://www.outrightinternational.org/content/blackmail-and-extortion-lgbt-people-sub-saharan-africa |title=Blackmail and Extortion of LGBT People in Sub-Saharan Africa &amp;#124; OutRight |publisher=Outrightinternational.org |date=2010-06-02 |accessdate=2016-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

An important element of psychological control is the isolation of the victim from the outside world.&lt;ref name="WHO 2013 p. 7"&gt;[http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/85239/1/9789241564625_eng.pdf ''Global and regional estimates of violence against women: prevalence and health effects of intimate partner violence and non-partner sexual violence.''] World Health Organization. 2013. {{ISBN|978-92-4-156462-5}}. p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Isolation includes [[Abusive power and control|controlling]] a person's social activity: who they see, who they talk to, where they go and any other method to limit their access to others. It may also include limiting what material is read.&lt;ref name="Duluth model"&gt;[http://www.theduluthmodel.org/pdf/PowerandControl.pdf ''Power and Control.''] Duluth Model.

'''Jangama dhyana''' is a [[meditation]] technique, which has been practiced by various sages over the centuries. In modern times, it has been used by Shri [[Shivabalayogi]] Maharaj and his direct disciple Shri [[Shivarudra Balayogi]] Maharaj to achieve [[self-realization]]. The technique is currently taught by Shri Shivarudra Balayogi. ''Jangama'' means 'eternal existence' and ''[[Dhyana in Hinduism|dhyana]]'' means 'meditation.' Hence ''Jangama dhyana'' is 'Meditation on the Eternal Existence (of the [[Self]]).'

== Origins ==
''Jangama dhyana'' is an ancient meditation technique which involves concentrating the mind and sight between the eyebrows. According to Patanjali, this is one method of achieving the initial concentration (''[[dharana]]'': [[Yoga Sutras]], III: 1) necessary for the mind to go introverted in meditation (''dhyana'': [[Yoga Sutras]], III: 2). In the deeper practice of the Jangama dhyana technique, the mind concentrated between the eyebrows begins to automatically lose all location and focus on the watching itself. Eventually, the meditator experiences only the consciousness of existence and achieves [[Self Realization]]. [[Swami Vivekananda]] describes the process in the following way:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
When the mind has been trained to remain fixed on a certain internal or external location, there comes to it the power of flowing in an unbroken current, as it were, towards that point. This state is called ''dhyana''. When one has so intensified the power of ''dhyana'' as to be able to reject the external part of perception and remain meditating only on the internal part, the meaning, that state is called ''Samadhi''.&lt;ref&gt;See Swami Vivekenanda on ''Dhyana'' and ''Samadhi'' in Raja Yoga [[s:The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda/Volume 1/Raja-Yoga/Dhyana And Samadhi/here]].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The point between the eyebrows is referred to as the ''[[bhrikuti]]'' and symbolically as the ''[[ajna chakra]]'', which means 'commanding circle.' When the mind becomes totally concentrated at this point, one becomes the commander of one's mind. Until then, the meditator will not have achieved self-mastery. The [[Bhagavad Gita]] describes the process and benefits of the meditation technique as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Shutting off sense &lt;br /&gt; 
From what is outward,&lt;br /&gt; 
Fixing the gaze &lt;br /&gt; 
At the root of the eye-brows,&lt;br /&gt; 
Checking the breath-stream&lt;br /&gt; 
In and outgoing &lt;br /&gt; 
Within the nostrils, &lt;br /&gt;
Holding the senses, &lt;br /&gt;
Holding the intellect, &lt;br /&gt;
Thrusts fear aside, &lt;br /&gt;
Thrusts aside anger &lt;br /&gt;
And puts off desire: &lt;br /&gt;
Truly that man &lt;br /&gt;
Is made free for ever.&lt;ref&gt;Swami Prabhavananda and Christoper Isherwood, 1987, ''Bhagavad-Gita: The Song of God'',  p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In modern times, the 19th century Yogi, Shri [[Ramakrishna]] Paramahamsa, practiced meditating between the eyebrows in order to achieve ''[[Nirvikalpa Samadhi]]'' (bringing the mind to a complete standstill, beyond imagination). Though he was able to withdraw his mind from all external sensations and objects, he initially could not go beyond the vision of goddess [[Kali]], which his mind had become totally concentrated upon during his long period of devotional ''[[tapas]]''. Shri [[Ramakrishna]] recounts how his [[Guru]] on the path of [[Advaita Vedanta]], Totapuri, gave him further instruction in the meditation technique to overcome this obstacle:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
He cast his eyes around. Finding a piece of glass he took it up and stuck it between my eyebrows... 'Concentrate the mind on this point!' he thundered. Then with stern determination I again sat to meditate... The last barrier fell. My spirit at once soared beyond the relative plane and I lost myself in ''Samadhi''.&lt;ref&gt;M., ''The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna'', p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Later Shri Ramakrishna was to give the same instruction in meditation to his illustrious disciple [[Swami Vivekananda]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Life of the Swami Vivekananda'', Volume I, 1979, Advaita Ashrama, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the technique is associated with Shri [[Shivabalayogi]] Maharaj and his direct disciple Shri [[Shivarudra Balayogi]] Maharaj. Shri Shivabalayogi was initiated into the technique at the age of fourteen. On 7 August 1949, he experienced a vision of a tall Jangama Sage (ancient order of ascetics) with matted hair, who told him to sit in padmasana (lotus posture), and close his eyes. The Sage then touched the young boy between the eyebrows and instructed, 'Watch here.' Thus, Shri Shivabalayogi Maharaj sat in ''[[tapas]]'' (deep, prolonged meditation) for twelve years, meditating for 23 hours a day for eight years and around 12 hours a day for the remaining four years. After this period, he initiated tens of thousands of people into the meditation technique he had used to achieve Self Realization. 
In 1994, Shri Shivabalayogi initiated his direct disciple, Seenu, into ''tapas'' using the Jangama dhyana technique. He achieved Self Realization in November 1999 and was given the name Shri Shivarudra Balayogi Maharaj, after meditating for around 20 hours a day over five years.

== Name ==
The name for the technique was coined by Shri Shivabalayogi while walking around the [[Dehradun]] [[ashram]] one night with his direct disciple, Seenu, who was later to become the Enlightened Yogi, Shri Shivarudra Balayogi. He suddenly turned to Seenu and said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Perhaps it would be nice to name the meditation technique we are teaching worldwide as ''Jangama dhyana.'' Lord Shiva first appeared to me in the form of a Jangama Sage to impart the technique, and ''Jangama'' means 'Eternal Existence'; so ''Jangama dhyana'' would mean 'meditation on the Eternal Existence of the Self.'&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Young, 2008, ''Guru-Disciple'', p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Technique ==
The Jangama dhyana technique is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;See description on the [http://www.shivarudrabalayogi.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=531&amp;Itemid=38/ website of Shri Shivarudra Balayogi].&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Sit, closing the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;
Concentrate the mind and sight in between eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;
Keep watching there by focusing the attention.&lt;br /&gt;
Do not repeat any mantra or name.&lt;br /&gt;
Do not imagine anything.&lt;br /&gt;
Do not open eyes until the duration of meditation is over.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Today, initiation into this technique is given by Shri Shivarudra Balayogi Maharaj. He identifies the greatest secret of meditation as not analyzing any thoughts or visions that may appear:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
This meditation is a purification process, but this purification doesn't occur quietly. During the purification, visions and thoughts come. It is just like when you are washing clothes; you see the dirt coming out into the water. In the same way, when the mind is going through the purification, then thoughts and visions occur. But they occur only for a moment, and then they disappear. That is why we need to be so careful in this regard, because if you are watching, then the mind can very easily get involved in the thought, and if it gets involved it can further acquire new imprints. This re-acquiring is so subtle. This is why it is so important not to analyze thoughts during meditation, and this is also why the total cleansing of the mind takes time.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, C&amp;C, 2007, ''From the Heart of Peace'', p. 95-96.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Visions and experiences are not important in meditation. The only symptom of progress is greater peace. After being totally cleansed through meditation, the mind becomes pure consciousness capable of realizing through deeper meditation (''Samadhi'') its existence beyond imagination as the eternal [[Self]].  This state is known as [[Self Realization]] or [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|Enlightenment]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5103">In [[ring theory]], a subfield of [[abstract algebra]], a '''right Kasch ring''' is a ring ''R'' for which every [[simple module|simple]] right ''R'' [[module (mathematics)|module]] is isomorphic to a [[right ideal]] of ''R''.&lt;ref&gt;This ideal is necessarily a [[minimal right ideal]].&lt;/ref&gt; Analogously the notion of a '''left Kasch ring''' is defined, and the two properties are independent of each other.

Kasch rings are named in honor of mathematician [[Friedrich Kasch]]. Kasch originally called [[Artinian ring]]s whose proper [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]]s have nonzero [[annihilator (ring theory)|annihilator]]s ''S-rings''. {{harv|Kasch|1954}}{{harv|Morita|1966}} The characterizations below show that Kasch rings generalize S-rings.

==Definition==
Equivalent definitions will be introduced only for the right-hand version, with the understanding that the left-hand analogues are also true. The Kasch conditions have a few equivalent statements using the concept of [[annihilator (ring theory)|annihilator]]s, and this article uses the same notation appearing in the annihilator article.

In addition to the definition given in the introduction, the following properties are equivalent definitions for a ring ''R'' to be right Kasch. They appear in {{harv|Lam|1999|loc=p. 281}}:
# For every simple right ''R'' module ''S'', there is a nonzero module [[homomorphism]] from ''M'' into ''R''.
# The [[maximal ideal|maximal right ideal]]s of ''R'' are right annihilators of ring elements, that is, each one is of the form &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{r.ann}(x)\,&lt;/math&gt; where ''x'' is in ''R''.
# For any maximal right ideal ''T'' of ''R'', &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{\ell.ann}(T)\neq\{0\}&lt;/math&gt;.
# For any proper right ideal ''T'' of ''R'', &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{\ell.ann}(T)\neq\{0\}&lt;/math&gt;.
# For any maximal right ideal ''T'' of ''R'', &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{r.ann}(\mathrm{\ell.ann}(T))=T&lt;/math&gt;.
# ''R'' has no [[dense submodule|dense]] right ideals except ''R'' itself.

==Examples==

*Let ''R'' be a [[semiprimary ring]] with [[Jacobson radical]] ''J''. If ''R'' is commutative, or if ''R''/''J'' is a [[simple ring]], then ''R'' is right (and left) Kasch. In particular, commutative [[Artinian ring]]s are right and left Kasch.
* For a division ring ''k'', consider a certain subring ''R'' of the four-by-four matrix ring with entries from ''k''. The subring ''R'' consists of matrices of the following form:
:: &lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}
a &amp; 0 &amp; b &amp; c \\
0 &amp; a &amp; 0 &amp; d \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; a &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; e \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
:This is a right and left Artinian ring which is right Kasch, but ''not'' left Kasch.
* Let ''S'' be the ring of [[power series]] on two noncommuting variables ''X'' and ''Y'' with coefficients from a field ''F''. Let the ideal ''A'' be the ideal generated by the two elements ''YX'' and ''Y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The [[quotient ring]] ''S''/''A'' is a [[local ring]] which is right Kasch but ''not'' left Kasch.
* Suppose ''R'' is a ring [[direct product]] of infinitely many nonzero rings labeled ''A''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;. The [[direct sum]] of the ''A''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; forms a proper ideal of ''R''. It is easily checked that the left and right annihilators of this ideal are zero, and so ''R'' is not right or left Kasch.
* The two-by-two upper (or lower) [[triangular matrix ring]] is not right or left Kasch.
* A ring with right [[Socle (mathematics)#Socle of a module|socle]] zero (i.e. &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{soc}(R_R)=\{0\}&lt;/math&gt;) cannot be right Kasch, since the ring contains no [[minimal ideal|minimal right ideal]]s. So, for example, [[domain (ring theory)|domain]]s which are not [[division ring]]s are not right or left Kasch.

[[File:loi m.gif|thumb|A typical LOI]]A '''letter of intent''' ('''LOI''' or '''LoI''', and sometimes capitalized as ''Letter of Intent'' in legal writing, but only when referring to a specific document under discussion) is a document outlining one or more agreements between two or more parties before the agreements are finalized. The concept is similar to a [[Heads of agreement (law)|heads of agreement]], [[term sheet]] or [[memorandum of understanding]]. Such outlined agreements may be mergers and acquisitions transaction agreements,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.themalawyer.com/what-you-need-to-know-about-ma-letters-of-intent/|title = What you need to know about M&amp;A letters of Intent|date = July 20, 2015|accessdate = August 28, 2015|website = The M&amp;A Lawyer Blog|publisher = Jasso Lopez PLLC|last = Lopez|first = Erik}}&lt;/ref&gt; joint venture agreements, real property lease agreements and several other categories of agreements that may govern material transactions.
* LOIs resemble short, written [[contract]]s, but are usually in tabular form and not binding on the parties in their entirety. Many LOIs, however, contain provisions that are binding, such as those governing [[non-disclosure agreement|non-disclosure]], [[governing law]], [[Exclusive right|exclusivity]] or [[Covenant (law)|covenants]] to negotiate in [[good faith]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; An LOI may sometimes be interpreted by a court of law as binding the parties to it if it too-closely resembles a formal contract and does not contain clear disclaimers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.mintz.com/newsletter/2013/Advisories/3203-0713-NAT-COR/index.html|title = When a Non-binding Term Sheet Becomes Binding|date = July 8, 2013|accessdate = August 28, 2015|website = Mintz Levin|publisher = Mintz Levin Cohn Ferris Glovsky and Popeo PC|last = Burwell|first = Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A letter of intent may be presented by one party to another party and subsequently negotiated before execution (or signature). If carefully negotiated, an LOI may serve to protect both parties to a transaction. For example, a seller of a business may incorporate what is known as a non-solicitation provision, which would restrict the buyer's ability to hire an employee of the seller's business should the two parties not be able to close the transaction. On the other hand, an LOI may protect the buyer of a business by expressly conditioning its obligation to complete the transaction if is unable to secure financing for the transaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exitpromise.com/letter-of-intent-to-buy-or-sell-a-business/|title=Letter of Intent to Buy A Business - Exit Promise|author=|date=11 March 2013|website=exitpromise.com|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purposes of an LOI ==
Common purposes of an LOI are:
* To allow parties to sketch out fundamental terms quickly before expending substantial resources on negotiating definitive agreements, finalizing due diligence, pursuing third-party approvals and other matters&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* To declare officially that the parties are currently negotiating, as in a [[merger]] or [[joint venture]] proposal
* To provide safeguards in case a deal collapses during negotiation
* To verify certain issues regarding payments made for someone else (''e.g.'', credit card payments)

Potential downsides to using an LOI may include:
* The parties may engage in protracted negotiations on only a subset of a deal’s terms
* Management time and focus may be diverted
* Alternative opportunities may be missed and markets may move against the parties during negotiations
* Parties may reduce their lack of a workable deal framework into an LOI, with a hope of making progress later
* Public disclosure obligations may be inadvertently triggered
* The risk of leaks, exacerbated by the desire of some to tout the LOI to the world, or shop it to other parties&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Specific examples==
{{See also|National Letter of Intent}}
In [[academia]], a letter of intent is part of the application process,{{clarify|date=November 2011|reason=For what? Grad school? Grants?}} in which it is also known as a statement of purpose or [[Admissions essay|application essay]]. In education in the [[United States]], letters of intent are also frequently reached between high school senior athletes and colleges/universities, for the reservation of [[athletic scholarship]]s for the athletes upon graduation from high school.  [[Head teacher|School administrator]]s in [[secondary education]] often require a letter of intent before approving the formation of a [[Extracurricular activity|student club]].

In [[real estate]], in cases where the [[real property]] in question is not listed on a [[multiple listing service]], there may not be an easy way to notify the owner of the property and other interested parties of intent to purchase. Often it is necessary to officially begin the process of a purchase, and allow all peripheral interested parties to begin any other processes, with a letter of intent. For example, a multimillion-dollar loan for a commercial property may require a letter of intent before a financial institution will allow personnel to spend time working on said loan necessary for the completion of the sale. The same may be followed at the time of purchase by any company. A tenant and landlord may sign a letter of intent prior to signing a lease agreement to stipulate rental rates and all regulations of the future tenancy.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

In the [[solicitation]] of government grants, a letter of intent is highly encouraged but it is not required or binding, and does not enter into the review of a subsequent application.  The information that it contains allows agency staff to estimate the potential workload and plan the review.&lt;ref name="WSHCA"&gt;Typical example: {{Citation|author= |title=2008 Grant Solicitation for Consumer-Controlled Health Record Bank Pilots |url=http://www.hca.wa.gov/hit/documents/officialhrbgrant051408.pdf |accessdate=2008-05-21 |publisher=Washington State Health Care Authority |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723192909/http://www.hca.wa.gov/hit/documents/officialhrbgrant051408.pdf |archivedate=July 23, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3415">'''Moral certainty''' is a concept of intuitive [[probability]]. It means a very high degree of probability, sufficient for action, but short of absolute or mathematical certainty.

==Origins==
The notion of different degrees of certainty can be traced back to a statement in [[Aristotle]]'s [[Nicomachean Ethics]] that one must be content with the kind of certainty appropriate to different subject matters, so that in practical decisions one cannot expect the certainty of mathematics. &lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Ethics'' (1976) pp. 64–5&lt;/ref&gt;

The Latin phrase ''moralis certitudo'' was first used by the [[France|French]] philosopher [[Jean Gerson]] about 1400,&lt;ref&gt;H. E. Braun/E. Vallance eds., ''The Renaissance Conscience'' (2011) p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; to provide a basis for moral action that could (if necessary) be ''less'' exact than Aristotelian practical knowledge, thus avoiding the dangers of [[philosophical scepticism]] and opening the way for a benevolent [[casuistry]].&lt;ref&gt;Braun, p. 12 and p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] mentions occurrences in English from 1637. 

==Law==
In law, moral (or 'virtual') certainty has been associated with [[verdict]]s based on certainty [[beyond a reasonable doubt]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.law.com/default2.asp?selected=1281&amp;bold=%7C%7C%7C%7C Legal definition of "moral certainty"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Moral certainty, a quantum of evidence of about 100 percent proof, is required in two kinds of cases:
# In a criminal prosecution, when no [[direct evidence]] exists, the [[circumstantial evidence]] must be ''morally certain''; see ''[[Lizzie Borden]]''.
# In a [[DNA paternity testing|paternity testing]] case, when a [[putative father]] has been adjudicated to be the actual father by [[clear and convincing evidence]], then ''moral certainty'' is required to disprove [[Parent|paternity]], the [[Blame|onus]] being moved to the newly found father.


Legal debate about instructions to seek a moral certainty has turned on the changing definitions of the phrase over time. Whereas it ''can'' be understood as an equivalent to 'beyond reasonable doubt', in another sense moral certainty refers to a firm conviction which ''does not'' correlate but rather opposes evidentiary certainty:&lt;ref&gt;R. L. Moore, ''Mass Communication Law and Ethics'' (1999) pp. 52–3&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. one may have a firm subjective gut feeling of guilt – a feeling of moral certainty – without the evidence necessarily justifying a guilty conviction.

[[File:Musical saw 2.jpg|250px|thumbnail|right|A busker playing a musical saw in Prague]]

A '''musical saw''', also called a '''singing saw''', is a [[hand saw]] used as a [[musical instrument]]. Capable of continuous [[glissando]] ([[portamento]]), the sound creates an ethereal tone, very similar to the [[theremin]]. The musical saw is classified as a plaque friction [[idiophone]] with direct friction (132.22) under the [[Hornbostel-Sachs]] system of [[musical instrument classification]].

==Playing==
{{Quote|[The musical saw is] a flexible handsaw played by holding the handle between the knees and bending the blade while bowing along the flat edge. The musical saw is found in the folk music of Russia and rural America, and is a popular vaudeville instrument.&lt;ref name="Nardolillo"&gt;Nardolillo, Jo (2014). ''All Things Strings'', pg. 90. Scarecrow; {{ISBN|9780810884441}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The saw is generally played seated with the handle squeezed between the legs, and the far end held with one hand. Some sawists play standing, either with the handle between the knees and the blade sticking out in front of them. The saw is usually played with the serrated edge, or "teeth", facing the body, though some players face them away. Some saw players file down the teeth which makes no discernable difference to the sound. Many—especially professional—saw players use a handle, called a Cheat, at the tip of the saw for easier bending and higher virtuosity.

To sound a note, a sawist first bends the blade into an S-curve. The parts of the blade that are curved are damped from vibration, and do not sound. At the center of the S-curve a section of the blade remains relatively flat. This section, the "sweet spot", can vibrate across the width of the blade, producing a distinct [[pitch (music)|pitch]]: the wider the section of blade, the lower the sound. Sound is usually created by drawing a [[Bow (music)|bow]] across the back edge of the saw at the sweet spot, or sometimes by striking the sweet spot with a mallet. 

The sawist controls the pitch by adjusting the S-curve, making the sweet spot travel up the blade (toward a thinner width) for a higher pitch, or toward the handle for a lower pitch. [[Harmonic]]s can be created by playing at varying distances on either side of the sweet spot. Sawists can add [[vibrato]] by shaking one of their legs or by wobbling the hand that holds the tip of the blade. Once a sound is produced, it will [[sustain]] for quite a while, and can be carried through several [[Musical note|note]]s of a [[phrase (music)|phrase]].

On occasion the musical saw is called for in orchestral music, but orchestral percussionists are seldom also sawists.  If a note outside of the saw's range is called for, an electric guitar with a slide can be substituted.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Peinkofer and Fritz Tannigel, Handbook of Percussion Instruments, (Mainz, Germany: Schott, 1976), pg. 75.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Sawists often use standard wood-cutting saws, although special musical saws are also made. As compared with wood-cutting saws, the blades of musical saws are generally wider, for [[range (music)|range]], and longer, for finer control. They do not have set or sharpened teeth, and may have grain running parallel to the back edge of the saw, rather than parallel to the teeth. Some musical saws are made with thinner metal, to increase flexibility, while others are made thicker, for a richer [[timbre|tone]], longer sustain, and stronger harmonics. 

A typical musical saw is {{Convert|5|in|cm}} wide at the handle end and {{Convert|1|in|cm}} wide at the tip. Such a saw will generally produce about two [[octave]]s, regardless of length. A bass saw may be over {{Convert|6|in|cm}} at the handle and produce about two-and-a-half octaves. There are also musical saws with 3–4 octaves range, and new improvements have resulted in as much as 5 octaves note range. Two-person saws, also called "misery whips", can also be played, though with less virtuosity, and they produce an octave or less of range.

Most sawists use cello or violin bows, using violin [[rosin]], but some may use improvised home-made bows, such as a wooden dowel.

==Producers==
Musical saws have been produced for over a century, primarily in the United States, but also in Scandinavia, Germany, France (Lame sonore) and Asia.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

=== United States ===
In the early 1900s, there were at least ten companies in the United States manufacturing musical saws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sawlady.com/DifferentSaws.htm|title=Musical Saw manufacturers|website=Sawlady.com|last = Paruz|first = Natalia|accessdate=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These saws ranged from the familiar steel variety to gold-plated masterpieces worth hundreds of dollars. However, with the start of World War II the demand for metals made the manufacture of saws too expensive and many of these companies went out of business. By the year 2000, only three companies in the United States—Mussehl &amp; Westphal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicalsaws.com/|title=The World's Finest Musical Saws - Anyone Can Play - Mussehl &amp; Westphal|website=Musical Saws|accessdate=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charlie Blacklock,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blacklocksaws.com|title=Home - Charlie Blacklock Musical Saws|website=Home - Charlie Blacklock Musical Saws|accessdate=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Wentworth&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicalsaw.com/|title=Singing Saw - Musical Saws For Sale - Easiest Instrument To Learn|website=Musical Saw - Singing Saw|accessdate=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;—were making saws.

===Marlene Dietrich===
German actress and singer [[Marlene Dietrich]], who lived and worked in the United States for a long time, is probably the most well known musical saw player. When she studied the violin for one year in Weimar in her early twenties, her musical skills were already evident. Some years later she learned to play the musical saw while she was shooting the film "Café Electric" in Vienna in 1927. Her colleague, the Bavarian actor and musician Igo Sym told her how to play. In the shooting breaks and at weekends both performed romantic duets, he at the piano and she at the musical saw.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Spoto: ''Marlene Dietrich.'' Heyne Verlag, München 1992, pg. 61.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sym gave his saw to her as a farewell gift. The following words are engraved on the saw: "Now Suidy is gone / the sun d’ont [sic!] / shine… / Igo / Vienna 1927"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kuenste-im-exil.de/KIE/Content/EN/Objects/dietrich-singende-saege-en.html?single=1|title=Objects - Marlene Dietrich’s Musical Saw|first=|last=|website=kuenste-im-exil.de|accessdate=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
She took the saw with her, when she left for Hollywood in 1929 and played there in the following years at film sets and Hollywood parties.
When she participated at the [[United Service Organizations]] (USO) shows for the US troops in 1944, she also played on the saw. Some of these shows were broadcast on radio, so there exist two rare recordings of her saw playing, embedded in entertaining interviews. 1. Aloha Oe&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMLG5iqh5c0 Marlene Dietrich performing "Aloha oe" on the musical saw]"&lt;/ref&gt;  2. other song&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo97E2H2Ec8|title=Marlene Dietrich Plays Her Musical Saw! 1948|date=14 January 2015|accessdate=31 July 2018|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composers and compositions==
{{moresources|section|date=July 2018}}
Beginning from the early 1920s composers of both contemporary and popular music wrote for the musical saw.
Probably the first was [[Dmitri Shostakovich]].  He included the musical saw, e.g., in the film music for ''[[The New Babylon]]'' (1929), in ''[[The Nose (opera)|The Nose]]'' (1928),&lt;ref name="Nardolillo"/&gt; and in ''[[Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District (opera)|Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District]]'' (1934).
Shostakovich and other composers of his time used the term "Flexaton" to mark the musical saw. "Flexaton" just means "to flex a tone"—the saw is flexed to change the pitch. Unfortunately, there exists another instrument called [[Flexatone]], so there has been confusion for a long time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.singende-saege.com/shostakovich-the-nose.html|title=Flexaton / Musical saw in Shostakovich's opera "The nose" - Katharina Micada - Singende Säge|first=Katharina|last=Micada|website=Singende-saege.com|accessdate=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aram Khachaturian]], who knew Shostakovich's music included the musical saw in his [[Piano Concerto (Khachaturian)|Piano Concerto]] (1936)&lt;ref name="Nardolillo"/&gt; in the second movement. Another composer was the Swiss [[Arthur Honegger]], who included the saw in his opera ''[[Antigone (Honegger)|Antigone]]'' in 1924 . 
The Romanian composer [[George Enescu]] used the musical saw at the end of the second act of his opera ''[[Œdipe (opera)| Œdipe]]'' (1931) to show in an extensive glissando—which begins with the mezzo-soprano and is continued by the saw—the death and ascension of the sphinx killed by Oedipus.
The Italian composer [[Giacinto Scelsi]] wrote a part for the saw in his quarter-tone piece ''Quattro pezzi per orchestra'' (1959). German composer [[Hans Werner Henze]] took the saw to characterize the mean hero of his tragical opera ''[[Elegy for young lovers]]'' (1961).&lt;br/&gt;
Other composers were [[Krysztof Penderecki]] with ''Fluorescences'' (1961), ''De natura sonoris Nr. 2'' (1971) and the opera ''[[Ubu Rex]]'' (1990), [[Bernd Alois Zimmermann]] with ''Stille und Umkehr'' (1970), [[George Crumb]] with ''[[Ancient voices of children]]'' (1970), [[John Corigliano]] with ''[[The Mannheim Rocket]]'' (2001).&lt;br/&gt;
[[Chaya Czernowin]] used the saw in her opera "PNIMA...Ins Innere" (2000) to represent the character of the grandfather, who is traumatized by the Holocaust.&lt;br/&gt; 
There are Further [[Leif Segerstam]], [[Hans Zender]] (orchestration of "5 préludes" by Claude Debussy), [[Franz Schreker]] (opera ''Christophorus'') and [[Oscar Strasnoy]] (opera ''Le bal'').&lt;br/&gt;
Russian composer [[Lera Auerbach]] wrote for the saw in her ballet ''The Little Mermaid'' (2005), in her symphonic poem ''Dreams and Whispers of Poseidon'' (2005), in her oratorio "Requiem Dresden – Ode to Peace" (2012), in her Piano Concerto No.1 (2015), in her comic oratorio ''The Infant Minstrel and His Peculiar Menagerie'' (2016)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sikorski.de/10619/en/new_work_the_infant_minstrel_and_his_peculiar_menagerie_by_lera_auerbach_in_bergen.html|title=The Infant Minstrel and His Peculiar Menagerie|author=Lera Auerbach|website=Sikorski.de|accessdate=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in her violin concerto Nr.4 "NyX – Fractured dreams" (2017).

Canadian composer Robert Minden has written extensively for the musical saw.&lt;ref&gt;see for example: "Serenade" from ''The Boy Who Wanted To Talk To Whales'', "Epilogue" from ''Long Journey Home'': [http://www.lostsound.com/recordings/default.html Catalogue: Otter Bay Productions], LostSound.com; accessed July 31, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael A. Levine]] composed ''[[Divination By Mirrors for Saw and Strings|Divination By Mirrors]]'' for musical saw soloist and two string ensembles tuned a [[quarter tone]] apart, taking advantage of the saws ability to play in both tunings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.violin-saw.com/daleviolinist/dalesawist.html|title=violin and musical saw|website=Violin-saw.com|accessdate=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20031120033216/http://www.ncco.org/Reviews/sacgaz10_17_03.htm Varied Program Highlights New Century Premier], NCCO.org; accessed July 31, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

The alleged '''illicit activities of the North Korean state''' include [[Illegal drug trade|manufacture and sale of illegal drugs]], the manufacture and sale of counterfeit goods, [[human trafficking]], [[arms trafficking]], [[Wildlife trade|wildlife trafficking]], [[counterfeit money|counterfeiting currency]] (especially the [[United States dollar]] and [[Chinese yuan]]), [[terrorism]], and other areas.&lt;ref name="Nautilus"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nautilus.org/publications/books/dprkbb/terrorism/dprk-briefing-book-curtailing-north-koreas-illicit-activities/|title=DPRK Briefing Book : Curtailing North Korea's Illicit Activities|author=Balbina Hwang|publisher=Heritage Foundation|date=August 25, 2003|accessdate=April 8, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6SLgVJkRm|archivedate=4 Sep 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTpg4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/23/magazine/23counterfeit.html?pagewanted=4&amp;_r=0|title=No Ordinary Counterfeit|author=Stephen Mihm |publisher=New York Times|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6SLgbhjs1|archivedate=4 Sep 2014|deadurl=no|date=July 23, 2006|accessdate=April 9, 2014|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/07/13/north-korean-diplomats-linked-to-lucrative-rhino-horn-trade-in-a/|title=North Korean diplomats linked to lucrative rhino horn trade in Africa|last=Ryall|first=Julian|date=2016-07-13|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2018-03-27|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is alleged many of these activities are undertaken at the direction and under the control of, the [[North Korean government]] and the ruling [[Workers' Party of Korea]], with their proceeds going towards advancing the country's [[North Korea and weapons of mass destruction|nuclear and conventional arms production]], funding the lifestyles of the country's elite, and propping up the [[Economy of North Korea|North Korean economy]].&lt;ref name=kan&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kan, Paul |author2=Bechton, Bruce |author3=Collins, Robert |title=Criminal Sovereignty: Understanding North Korea's Illicit International Activities|year=2010|publisher=Strategic Studies Institute |isbn=9781584874324}}{{rp|2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Unlike criminal syndicates, the extensive nature of these illegal endeavors, and the claim that they are directed and sanctioned by the highest levels of government,&lt;ref name=kan /&gt;{{rp|1}} has led to the nature of the North Korean state being defined as a form of "criminal sovereignty" by foreign policy experts such as [[Paul Rexton Kan]] and [[Bruce Bechtol]].&lt;ref name=kan /&gt;{{rp|3}}

However, there are questions remaining about the level of government involvement in each of the criminal enterprises. Many commentators agree that the North Korean state has been behind counterfeiting currency, human trafficking, the arms trade, etc., but the level to which it has been involved in the drug trade after the collapse of the [[Economy of North Korea#Food distribution system|Public Distribution System]] in the 1990s is not clear as semi-private and private black markets have arisen since then and some high-ranking officials may only be engaged in illicit trade for personal benefit.&lt;ref name=gret&gt;{{cite book|author=Greitens, Sheena|year=2014|title= Illicit: North Korea's Evolving Operations to Earn Hard Currency, Committee for Human Rights in North Korea|isbn=978-0-9856480-2-2|url=http://www.hrnk.org/uploads/pdfs/SCG-FINAL-FINAL.pdf|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6SLjbfuGJ|archivedate=4 Sep 2014|deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6}}

===Critical assessment===
The British academic, Hazel Smith, has argued that the allegations have a weak foundation, being largely based on the claims of a few US officials and North Korean defectors. She has pointed out that there have been very few criminal convictions. She has queried the assumption that all the activities are directed by North Korea's government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/27/north-korea-cliches-debunked-hazel-smith|title=Dangerous, isolated and primed for war? North Korean clichés debunked|first=Hazel|last=Smith|publisher=The Guardian|date=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to North Korea scholar [[Andrei Lankov]], the country's illicit activities never developed into lucrative hard currency earners. Instead, these activities exposed the country to international condemnation in exchange for marginal gain. Lankov suggests that smuggling was never intended to earn currency for the regime, but was simply a means of survival for diplomats whose funding was cut.&lt;ref name="Lankov2016"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lankov|first=Andrei|title=The Real North Korea: Life and Politics in the Failed Stalinist Utopia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FHpYCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA23|year=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-939003-8|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drug trade==
 
It is alleged that North Korea's illegal drug trade dates back to the 1970s and includes the manufacturing, selling, and trafficking of illicit drugs, as well as counterfeit otherwise legal pharmaceuticals.&lt;ref name="Insider"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/north-korea-meth-2014-4|title=North Korea's Huge Role In Global Meth Trade Revealed In Insane Criminal Case|author=Keegan Hamilton|publisher=Business Insider|date=April 4, 2014|accessdate=April 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Production began in the mountainous Hamkyung and Yangkang Provinces, particularly in the village of Yonsah, where [[Kim Il-sung]] sanctioned the creation of an [[opium]] farm.&lt;ref name=gret /&gt;{{rp|20}}

To provide a cover of legitimacy, the North Korean government uses [[front organization|front companies]], like the Ryugyong Corporation under the control of the [[Workers' Party of Korea|Korean Workers Party]]'s Foreign Relations Department, to conduct clandestine activities.&lt;ref name="NewFocus"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newfocusintl.com/the-dprk-is-capitalist-when-it-wants-to-be-the-story-of-drugs-incorporated-parts-12/|title=The DPRK is capitalist when it wants to be: the story of Drugs Incorporated|author=Staff|publisher=New Focus International|date=August 18, 2012|accessdate=April 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company also holds large tracts of land within the country for the sole purpose of growing opium&lt;ref name="Nautilus"/&gt; and each year the company sent tens of thousands of dollars in hard currency to [[Kim Jong-il]] for his use. Unlike most companies, Ryugyong Corporation has no import or export quota restrictions.&lt;ref name="NewFocus"/&gt;

According to defector Yoon Yong Sol, during the [[North Korean famine|famine]] "[t]here were some complaints that during the famine we should be growing grain, not poppies, but the instruction from the central government was that if we grow poppies we can sell the product for 10 times as much to buy grain. ... The only way to earn hard currency is by drugs."&lt;ref name=gret /&gt;{{rp|22}}

Reports of [[methamphetamine]] (known as "ice drug" in North Korea) use in the country surfaced in the late 1990s.&lt;ref name="ForeignPolicy"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/11/21/inside_north_koreas_crystal_meth_trade|title=Inside North Korea's Crystal Meth Trade|author=Issac Stone Fish|work=Foreign Policy|date=November 21, 2013|accessdate=September 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Isaac Stone Fish writing in ''[[Foreign Policy]]'', the production of methamphetamine in North Korea is done by chemists and other underemployed scientists.&lt;ref name="ForeignPolicy"/&gt; Methamphetamine is given as a medication within North Korea, which has helped to fuel its spread. As the production and sale of opium declined in the mid-2000s, methamphetamine became more pervasive.&lt;ref name="ForeignPolicy"/&gt; To bring in much-needed cash, the international methamphetamine trade began, spreading first to China, and with the drug being made in state-run laboratories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2013/08/21/how-north-korea-got-itself-hooked-on-meth/|title=How North Korea got itself hooked on meth|author=Max Fisher|work=Washington Post|date=August 21, 2013|accessdate=September 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Isaac Stone Fish admitted with regard to his report: "I have no idea what is actually happening inside North Korea".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Black Hole of North Korea|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/09/opinion/09iht-edfish09.html?_r=0|first=Isaac|last=Stone Fish|publisher=''New York Times''|date=8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

China officially admitted to the drug problem stemming from North Korea in 2004, with [[Jilin Province]] being the most important transhipment point from North Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brookings.edu/research/articles/2010/12/03-china-drug-trafficking-zhang|title=Drug Trafficking from North Korea: Implications for Chinese Policy|author=Yong-an Zhang|publisher=Brookings Institution|date=December 3, 2010|accessdate=September 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The production, storage, financing, and sale of the North Korea's methamphetamine trade reaches multiple countries from the Philippines, the United States, Hong Kong, Thailand, western Africa and others.&lt;ref name="Insider"/&gt; In 2010, five foreign nationals were prosecuted as part of a conspiracy involving North Korea to smuggle 40 pounds of methamphetamine into the United States and to sell it for $30,000 a pound.&lt;ref name="ForeignPolicy"/&gt;

In 2001, income from illegal drugs amounted to between $500 million and $1 billion.&lt;ref name="Nautilus"/&gt; In a 2013 ''[[Washington Post]]'' article, annual revenues from methamphetamine sales are estimated at $100 million to $200 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2013/03/22/report-north-korea-ordered-its-foreign-diplomats-to-become-drug-dealers/|title=Report: North Korea ordered its foreign diplomats to become drug dealers|author=Max Fisher|work=Washington Post|date=March 22, 2013|accessdate=September 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1977 and 2003, more than twenty North Korean diplomats, agents, and trade officials have been implicated, detained, or arrested in drug-smuggling operations in more than a dozen countries.&lt;ref name="Nautilus"/&gt; In 2004, two North Korean embassy employees were caught smuggling 150,000 tablets of [[clonazepam]] in Egypt, and in that same year, embassy employees from Bulgaria were arrested in Turkey in possession of over 500,000 tablets of [[Captagon]] (the brand name for the synthetic stimulant fenethylline, or phenethylline), with an estimated street value of $7 million.&lt;ref name=gret /&gt;{{rp|37}} The government of North Korea has only admitted that individuals undertook such acts, and not at the direction of the state.&lt;ref name=gret /&gt;{{rp|17}}

According to the [[Committee for Human Rights in North Korea]], since 2001 drug trafficking operations by diplomats had ceased, with the focus then becoming the production of drugs to be smuggled by other criminal organizations.&lt;ref name=gret /&gt;{{rp|18}}

In 2003, the North Korean owned [[Pong Su]] was intercepted importing heroin into Australia. While four men who had landed pleaded guilty, the ship's four officers were acquitted on all charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Drug ship officers set free |date=6 March 2006 |publisher=News.com.au |url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,10117,18360926-421,00.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215105940/http://www.news.com.au/story/0,10117,18360926-421,00.html |archivedate=15 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Counterfeiting==

===Currency===
{{See also|Superdollar}}
Counterfeiting currency is alleged to have begun in the 1970s under [[Kim Jong-il]]'s direction; however, the notes produced at the time were not of high quality.&lt;ref name="NYTpg4"/&gt; Since then, and within the jurisdiction of [[Room 39]], the North Korean government has counterfeited $50 and $100 United States banknotes using increasingly sophisticated techniques. In 1994, authorities in Hong Kong and Macao apprehended five North Korean diplomats and trade-mission members carrying around $430,000 in bills that turned out to be "[[superdollar]]" (also called "supernote") counterfeits.&lt;ref name="NYTpg5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/23/magazine/23counterfeit.html?pagewanted=5&amp;_r=0|title=No Ordinary Counterfeit|author=Stephen Mihm |publisher=New York Times|date=July 23, 2006|accessdate=April 9, 2014|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been two primary reasons for counterfeiting: the first is to wage economic warfare against the United States,&lt;ref name="NYTpg4"/&gt; and secondly, to help ease North Korea's domestic economic problems.&lt;ref name="NYTpg5"/&gt; According to a report by Dr. Balbina Hwang of [[American University]], North Korea circulated $100 million in counterfeit currency in 2001.&lt;ref name="Nautilus"/&gt; The revenues from this are estimated at between $15 million and $25 million annually.&lt;ref name="CSM"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/2013/1008/New-100-bill-why-North-Korea-won-t-be-very-happy-video|title=New $100 bill: why North Korea won't be very happy|journal=Christian Science Monitor|author=Mike Eckel|date=October 8, 2013|accessdate=April 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the United States released its newly redesigned [[United States one hundred-dollar bill|100 dollar bill]]. The primary purpose of the redesign was to fight against counterfeiting and prevent the recurrence of the "supernotes" which were produced by North Korea.&lt;ref name="CSM"/&gt;

The [[International Convention for the Suppression of Counterfeiting Currency]] is the primary treaty whereby states agree to criminalize acts of currency counterfeiting. North Korea is not a party to the treaty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://treaties.un.org/pages/LONViewDetails.aspx?src=LON&amp;id=551&amp;chapter=30&amp;lang=en|title=International Convention for the Suppression of Counterfeiting Currency|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=April 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Analyst [[Andrei Lankov]] has described the evidence for the counterfeiting of superdollars as merely circumstantial.&lt;ref name="Lankov2016"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lankov|first=Andrei|title=The Real North Korea: Life and Politics in the Failed Stalinist Utopia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FHpYCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA23|year=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-939003-8|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gregory Elich of the Korea Policy Institute has argued that these allegations are unfounded. According to Elich, North Korea's [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] press from the 1970s would be incapable of printing the supernotes, and the paper and ink would be extremely difficult for North Korea to produce. Furthermore, he says that the amounts of supernotes produced are too small to be economical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=North Korea and the Supernote Enigma|url=http://www.globalresearch.ca/north-korea-and-the-supernote-enigma/8919|first=Gregory|last=Elich|publisher=Global Research|date=7 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Counterfeit legal pharmaceuticals===
There have been a few cases of North Korea being implicated in the production of counterfeit [[Viagra]]. These include: a 2004 arrest in [[Seoul, South Korea]] of a man with 4,000 counterfeit Viagra pills; and a 2005 report from Japan that North Korea was producing fake Viagra pills in factories in [[Chongjin]], which were then sold in Hong Kong to customers of other Southeast-Asian countries (including China), and the Middle East.&lt;ref name=gret /&gt;{{rp|38}} 

===Counterfeit cigarettes===
Counterfeit cigarettes have been a lucrative item for the country. The trade is believed to have begun in the 1990s and greatly increased in 2002 after Chinese authorities shut down many counterfeit operations in China, which then provided added incentive, knowledge, and capacity which could be relocated to North Korea.&lt;ref name=gret /&gt;{{rp|32}} During a 2006 Congressional hearing, Peter A. Prahar of the [[United States Department of State|Department of State]], quoted reports that mentioned the existence of "as many as 12" factories in the DPRK capable of producing "billions of packs of counterfeit cigarettes annually."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-109shrg28241/html/CHRG-109shrg28241.htm|title=- NORTH KOREA: ILLICIT ACTIVITY FUNDING THE REGIME|website=www.gpo.gov|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The factories appear to be owned and operated by the North Korean military.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The major factories for cigarette production were reportedly based in [[Rajin]], though defectors also mentioned a factory in [[Pyongyang]].&lt;ref name=gret /&gt;{{rp|33}}

In 1995, Taiwan stopped a ship and confiscated 20 containers of counterfeit cigarette packaging, which is enough to make 2 million cartons of popular Japanese and British brands.&lt;ref name=gret /&gt;{{rp|32}} In 2004, authorities in Vietnam, Taiwan, the Philippines, and Singapore also impounded containers filled with counterfeit cigarettes.&lt;ref name=gret /&gt;{{rp|33}} Official congressional testimony in 2006 revealed that North Korea-sourced [[Marlboro (cigarette)|Marlboro brand]] cigarettes had been identified in 1,300 incidents across the United States.&lt;ref name=gret /&gt;{{rp|35}} Revenues from counterfeit cigarettes are estimated at between $80 million and $160 million a year.&lt;ref name=gret /&gt;{{rp|36}}

==Human trafficking==
{{main|Human trafficking in North Korea}}

North Korea is a "Tier 3" country (those who do not comply with human trafficking laws) as listed by the U.S. Department of State and has retained this ranking since 2007.&lt;ref name="TraffickingReport"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/226847.pdf|title=Trafficking in Persons Report 2014: KOREA, DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF|publisher=U.S. Department of State|year=2014|pages=231–232|accessdate=September 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The country is a source country of men, women, and children for sex trafficking and forced labor. Forced labor is used both [[Human rights in North Korea#Internment camps for political prisoners|internally]] and externally. Countries which have North Korean forced laborers include Russia, China, Mongolia, and other places in Central Asia, Europe, Africa, and the Middle East.&lt;ref name="TraffickingReport"/&gt;

While the North Korean government claims these are "contract workers", reports claim that they are actually subjected to forced labor, that their movements and communications are subjected to strict surveillance, and that workers sent overseas do not have a choice in the type of work they will be doing nor do they receive pay for their work.&lt;ref name="TraffickingReport"/&gt;

It is estimated that there are thousands of North Koreans working in logging, construction, and agriculture industries in Russia. These workers reportedly only receive two days of rest each year and face punishment if they fail to meet quotas.&lt;ref name="TraffickingReport"/&gt;

North Korea is not a party to the 2000 UN [[Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children|TIP Protocol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://treaties.un.org/pages/viewdetails.aspx?src=ind&amp;mtdsg_no=xviii-12-a&amp;chapter=18&amp;lang=en|title=Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children|publisher=United Nations|date=April 9, 2014|accessdate=September 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arms trade==
During the 1980s, North Korea emerged as a ''legal'' arms trader to primarily [[Third World]] countries, exporting relatively inexpensive, technically unsophisticated, but reliable weapons.&lt;ref name="DIAC3"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://fas.org/irp/dia/product/knfms/knfms_chp3a.html|title=North Korea: The Foundations for Military Strength |chapter= 3A|publisher=Defense Intelligence Agency|date= 1991|accessdate=September 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Iran–Iraq War]], some 90% of arms exports from North Korea went to Iran, and between 1981 and 1989, North Korea earned an estimated $4 billion from arms sales.&lt;ref name="DIAC3"/&gt;

North Korea has a known track record in proliferating nuclear and missile technology and in 2001, missile sales came to $560 million.&lt;ref name="Nautilus"/&gt; Following its [[2006 North Korean nuclear test|2006 nuclear test]], international sanctions have sought to limit or prevent North Korea from exporting various types of arms, materials, and technology.&lt;ref name="HuffPost"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/17/north-korea-weapons-trade_n_3610668.html|title=North Korea's Weapons Trade: A Look At A Global Business|author=Foster Klug|work=Huffington Post|date=July 17, 2013|accessdate=September 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to UN sanctions however, countries such as Japan and the United States took unilateral steps to curb such activities.&lt;ref name="Nautilus"/&gt;

UN sanctions now ban all arms, including small arms and light weapons.&lt;ref name="CRS1874"/&gt;{{rp|14}}
North Korea has developed an extensive and complicated arms trade network in an attempt to circumvent sanctions and uses front companies and embassies to traffic weapons.&lt;ref name="Reuters"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/11/us-korea-korea-un-idUSBREA2A08020140311|title=Front companies, embassies mask North Korean weapons trade |author=James Pearson|newspaper=Reuters|date=March 11, 2014|accessdate=September 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2014 UN report, [[Syria]], [[Myanmar]], [[Eritrea]], [[Tanzania]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Somalia]] and [[Iran]] were all suspected to have bought weapons from North Korea.&lt;ref name="Reuters"/&gt;

===Incidents===
{{As of|2010}}, trade in banned small arms and ammunition was relatively insignificant, with reports include: imports totaling $45,500 by [[Brazil]] in 2007, of $3.1 million by the [[United Arab Emirates]] in 2006, and $364,400 by Ethiopia in 2005, and $121,400 by [[Mexico]] in 2005.&lt;ref name="CRS1874"/&gt;{{rp|14}}

In 2009, three vessels were intercepted which were carrying North Korean weapons. Western and Israeli intelligence officials believed the weapons were destined for [[Hezbollah]] and [[Hamas]].&lt;ref name="CRS1874"/&gt;{{rp|7}}

In December 2009, Thailand intercepted a charter jet from Pyongyang carrying 35 tons of conventional weapons, including [[surface-to-air missiles]].&lt;ref name="HuffPost"/&gt;

In 2012, the United Nations reported that 445 North Korean-made graphite cylinders (which can be used to produce ballistic missiles) were seized from a Chinese freighter at the South Korean port of [[Busan]] on their way to Syria.&lt;ref name="HuffPost"/&gt;

In 2013, a [[North Korean cargo ship seizure in Panama]] (carrying [[Cuba]]n weapons) took place.

In August 2016, US intelligence tracked a ship sailing under a [[Flag of convenience|convenience flag]] of [[Cambodia]], with a North Korean crew sailing from North Korea to [[Egypt]] was found with carrying 24,000 [[rocket-propelled grenades]] and components for another 6,000. It was ordered and paid by a private Egyptian business, but it is believed that it was for the [[Egyptian Army]]. The value of this order and others is estimated at $23 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Warrick|first1=Joby|title=A North Korean ship was seized off Egypt with a huge cache of weapons destined for a surprising buyer|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/a-north-korean-ship-was-seized-off-egypt-with-a-huge-cache-of-weapons-destined-for-a-surprising-buyer/2017/10/01/d9a4e06e-a46d-11e7-b14f-f41773cd5a14_story.html|publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]''|accessdate=25 November 2017|date=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/03/04/un-report-new-light-egypts-role-north-korean-weapons-sales/ | title=UN report to shed new light on Egypt's role in North Korean weapons sales| newspaper=The Telegraph| date=2018-03-04| last1=Ryall| first1=Julian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wildlife trade ==
Over the past three decades, at least 18 North Korean diplomats have been caught smuggling [[rhino horn]] and [[ivory]], though the real number is considered to be much higher.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://globalinitiative.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/TGIATOC-Diplomats-and-Deceipt-DPRK-Report-1868-web.pdf|title=Diplomats and Deceit: North Korea's Criminal Activities in Africa|last=Rademeyer|first=Julian|date=September 2017|website=Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; North Korean defectors have also reported smuggling of rhino horn and ivory from countries like [[Angola]], [[Ethiopia]], and the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[South Africa]] and [[Mozambique]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Such illegal activity is considered low-risk but highly rewarding for the regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/5b1ec8a4-9ee1-11e7-9a86-4d5a475ba4c5|title=North Korea said to be revitalising African wildlife trafficking|last=|first=|date=|website=Financial Times|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Room 39==
{{main|Room 39}}

==Politically motivated actions==
As well as illegal money-making ventures, North Korea has been condemned for politically motivated criminal acts related to the long-running [[Korean conflict]].

===Terrorism===
In 1988, North Korea was added to the [[State Sponsors of Terrorism]] list for supplying groups with weapons and for their role in the [[Rangoon bombing]] and the bombing of [[Korean Air Flight 858]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfr.org/state-sponsors-of-terrorism/state-sponsors-north-korea/p9364|title=State Sponsors: North Korea|author=Vikaas Sharma|publisher=Council on Foreign Relations|date=June 28, 2008|accessdate=September 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 President [[George W. Bush]] agreed to remove North Korea from the list after North Korea met their obligations to provide access to their nuclear program and the resumption of disabling of their nuclear facilities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7665206.stm | work=BBC News | title=N Korea taken off US terror list | date=October 11, 2008 | accessdate=April 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but continued hostilities and the fear that North Korea could sell nuclear weapons to terrorist organizations have called for the nation to be relisted.

In 2017, North Korea was relisted as a terrorist state in response to the murder of [[Kim Jong-nam]], its role in the [[Syrian Civil War]], close relationships with [[Iran]], and it backing Islamic terrorist organizations, especially [[Hamas]].&lt;ref name=NKIL&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/hamas-thanks-n-korea-for-its-support-against-israeli-occupation/ | title=Hamas thanks N.

===International abductions===
Between 1977 and 1983, [[North Korean abductions of Japanese citizens|North Korea abducted several Japanese citizens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nettv.gov-online.go.jp/eng/prg/prg1786.html|title=Abduction – An Unforgivable Crime|publisher=Japanese Government Internet TV|date=January 23, 2009|accessdate=September 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; North Korea has admitted to abducting 13 Japanese citizens,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mdn.mainichi-msn.co.jp/international/asia/news/20060413p2g00m0in046000c.html|accessdate=2006-05-01|title=North Korea rejects DNA link to Megumi Yokota abduction case|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Japan lists 17 as having been abducted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rachi.go.jp/en/ratimondai/jian.html|title=Individual Cases – 17 Abductees Identified by the Government of Japan|publisher=Japanese Government Headquarters for the Abduction Issue|date=May 2011|accessdate=September 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also testimonies which list nine Europeans as being abducted by North Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/international/2008/04/21/01003-20080421ARTFIG00614-les-captives-etrangeresde-la-coree-du-nord.php|title=Les captives étrangèresde la Corée du Nord|date=21 April 2008|publisher=|via=Le Figaro}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Korean War]] North Korea abducted an estimated 82,959 South Koreans, and in the post-war period South Korea claims that a further 489 [[North Korean abductions of South Koreans|South Koreans have been abducted by North Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sukuukai.jp/narkn/|title=North Korean Abduction Victims Worldwide|publisher=National Association for the Rescue of Japanese Kidnapped by North Korea|date=December 2006|accessdate=September 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hacking===
According to cybersecurity experts, North Korea maintains an army of hackers trained to disrupt enemy computer networks and steal both money and sensitive data. In the previous decade, it was blamed for numerous [[cyber-attack]]s and other hacking attacks in South Korea and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/world/asia/north-korea-hack-war-plans.html|title=North Korean Hackers Stole U.S.-South Korean Military Plans, Lawmaker Says|first=Choe|last=Sang-hun|publisher=New York Times|date=10 October 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171012061027/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/world/asia/north-korea-hack-war-plans.html|archivedate=12 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 October 2018, [[Bloomberg News|Bloomberg]] reported a North Korean hacking group had tried to steal at least $1.1 billion in a series of attacks on global banks from 2014-2018, as uncovered by cybersecurity company [[FireEye]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Onaran|first=Yalman|date=8 October 2018|title=North Korea Hackers Tried to Take $1.1 Billion in Bank Attacks|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-08/north-korea-hackers-broke-into-banks-tried-to-take-1-1-billion |publisher=Bloomberg|access-date=9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International responses==
The [[United Nations Security Council]] has passed multiple [[List of United Nations Security Council resolutions concerning North Korea|resolutions against North Korea]] and its weapons program including, [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 825|UNSC Resolution 825]] (May 1993), [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1695|UNSC Resolution 1695]] (July 2006), [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1874|UNSC 1874]] (June 2009), [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 2094|UNSC Resolution 2094]] (March 2013) and most recently,  [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 2371|UNSC Resolution 2371]] (August 2017). Were the international community to fully enforce UNSC 1874, it is estimated that North Korea would lose between $1.5 and $3.7 billion.&lt;ref name="CRS1874"/&gt;{{rp|4}}

Since 1950, the United States has maintained an [[North Korea–United States relations|embargo against North Korea]] for their role in starting the [[Korean War]]. The embargo and related sanctions have been extended to combat North Korea's various illicit activities and continued aggression.

In 2005, under the [[US Patriot Act]] section 311, $25 million of North Korea's cash was frozen at Macau-based [[Banco Delta Asia]], which the US Treasury said North Korea used for illicit activities.&lt;ref name="CRS1874"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/nuke/R40684.pdf|title=North Korea's Second Nuclear Test: Implications of U.N.

In 2010, US President [[Barack Obama]] signed [[Executive order (United States)|Executive Order]] 13551, which "targets North Korea’s importation and exportation of arms, importation of luxury goods, and other illicit activities, including money laundering, the counterfeiting of goods and currency, bulk cash smuggling, and narcotics trafficking."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/tg1146.aspx|title=Treasury Designates Financial Institution Involved in Facilitating North Korea's Illicit Activities|publisher=U.S. Department of the Treasury|date=April 19, 2011|accessdate=September 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8293">'''Oppressors–oppressed distinction''' or '''dominant-dominated opposition''' is a political concept. One of the first theorists to use it was [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], who wrote in his 1802 ''The German Constitution'': "The Catholics had been in the position of oppressors, and the Protestants of the oppressed".&lt;ref&gt;Translated by H B Nisbet for Cambridge University Press. Original quote: {{quotation|Die Katholiken hatten die Stellung von Unterdrückern, die Protestanten die der Unterdrückten}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Marx]] made the concept very influential, and it is often considered a fundamental element of [[Marxist analysis]].&lt;ref name="Kauppi96p61"&gt;Kauppi (1996) p.61&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Derrida94p55"&gt;Derrida (1994), ch.2 Conjurying--Marxism p.55&lt;/ref&gt; Some have judged it simplistic.&lt;ref name="Derrida94p55"/&gt; Many authors have adapted it to other contexts, including [[Friedrich Engels]], [[Karl Marx]], [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[Antonio Gramsci]], [[Simone Weil]], [[Paulo Freire]] and others. It has been used in a variety of contexts, including discussions of the [[bourgeoisie]] and [[proletariat]], [[imperialism]], and [[self-determination]].&lt;ref name="Halabi04"&gt;Halabi (2004) pp.59, 74-6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gordon (1991) p.145&lt;/ref&gt;

==Imperialism and self-determination ==
The theory of oppressor and oppressed nations has been part of Lenin's thought on imperialism, self-determination and criticisms of Social Democrats.&lt;ref name="Lenin 1927"&gt;Lenin (1927)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=March 2011}}

{{quote|"That is why the focal point in the Social-Democratic programme must be that division of nations into oppressor and oppressed which forms the essence of imperialism, and is deceitfully evaded by the social-chauvinists and Kautsky. This division is not significant from the angle of bourgeois pacifism or the philistine Utopia of peaceful competition among independent nations under capitalism, but it is most significant from the angle of the revolutionary struggle against imperialism"|Lenin, V.I, "The Revolutionary Proletariat and the Right of Nations to Self-Determination", ''Lenin Miscellany VI''&lt;ref name="Lenin 1927"/&gt;}}

==Criticism==

The political philosopher [[Kenneth Minogue]] provides a criticism of the oppressors-oppressed distinction in his work ''The Pure Theory of Ideology''. In the book's introduction, Minogue resumes the problem of the dialectical concept of oppression:

{{quote|"Have I really been in a battle?" wondered Stendhal's hero after many hours blundering around the field of Waterloo, and many people today share a similar perplexity. Like Stendhal's hero, they eat and drink and sustain the business of life, but the meaning of it all depends upon their conviction of contributing to the liberation of workers, women, the colonized, or other varieties of the oppressed. Like Fabrizio del Dongo, they find a regiment and tag along—the Hussars against Patriarchy, the Dragoon Guards of the Proletariat, and so on. Quite where the real battle lies is hotly disputed, but its significance is agreed to be a final end to oppression.
For these are people who believe that the term "oppression" is not merely a useful component of our rhetoric of grievances, but reveals the systematic character of how we live. As a typical formulation has it, plucked at random from a vast literature, "So long as some groups in society dominate others, the problem of conflict between persons and groups will remain." Or again: "Only a planet freed from class division and imperial exploitation, in which liberty and equality were common international realities, could be a peaceful environment for the human race." The lived texture of an ideological life, then, is to be found in the endeavors of millions to improve the world. There can be no doubt that this experience has been central to the last century and more.
My concern, however, is not with this lived experience but with what I identify as its central idea. The idea is so abstract that it is less a doctrine than a machine for generating doctrines, and its simplest formulation is that all evils are caused by an oppressive system. One of its more important corollaries is that truth is a weapon. This is the pure theory of ideology, and my aim is to explore its logical and rhetorical character.

[...]
My aim has been to present a critical map of the terrain, where "critical" means an attention to incoherence, tension, and contradiction, an attention, that is to say, to what I take to be the real connections of ideas. Here again, there is an ideological defense in depth, symbolized by the daring foray in which the very epithet "critical" has been appropriated as an ideological shibboleth and domesticated to mean any enquiry into social reality which, by probing the things technically called "contradictions," reveals it as an oppressive structure. The ideologist thus becomes critical ex officio. Those of us striving to join this desirable regiment by our own exertions thus find that we are rejected on the ground that to criticize those already known to be critical is to serve the interests of the status quo. The critic of criticism must be an apologist. Criticism, yoked to a fixed set of conclusions, turns into an orthodoxy.
My argument, then, is an exploration of the hypothesis that there is a pure theory of ideology, and while from one point of view it is a critique, from another it is a do-it-yourself ideology kit. It begins with some suggestions about how ideology was generated from eighteenth-century social theory. The long central section is an attempt to characterize ideologies as forms of understanding. The last section develops the view that, although ideology must take on political trappings in order to transform the world, its real character is entirely antithetical to the practice of politics. Ideology is to reality, I suggest, as (in Tolstoy's opinion) the reports of battles are to the concrete experience of individuals in the field. In ideological moods, we think we see in social and political life those clear lines from the history books depicting the battle order of the antagonists in massed array. They have neat, clear names like bourgeois and proletarian, colonialist and national, city-dweller and producer, in a word, oppressor and oppressed. The actual reality, however, is messy. Things change all the time, and it becomes impossible to keep any clear and distinct identities in focus. Confronting the arguments of ideology, we are forced to transform the Stendhalian question: Is it really a battle that we are in?

{{Judicial interpretation}}

'''Original intent''' is a theory in [[law]] concerning [[constitution]]al and [[statute|statutory]] interpretation. It is frequently used as a [[synonym]] for [[originalism]];{{ref|syn}} while original intent is indeed one theory in the originalist family, it has some salient differences which has led originalists from more predominant schools of thought such as [[original meaning]] to distinguish original intent as much as [[Legal realism|legal realists]] do.

==Approach==
Original intent maintains that in interpreting a text, a [[court]] should determine what the authors of the text were trying to achieve, and to give effect to what they ''intended'' the statute to accomplish, the actual ''text'' of the legislation notwithstanding.{{ref|Beal}}{{ref|Zander}} As in [[purposivism]], tools such as [[legislative history]] are often used.

==Problems==
===Originalist criticisms of original intent proponents (and some proposed rebuttals)===
Despite the potential confusion of terms between the original Intent and originalism, other schools of Originalist thought have been as critical of original intent as non-Originalists.{{ref|originalist-critics}}
* Original intent presumes that there ''is'' a single, unified intent behind a text. In the case of the United States Constitution, the [[Philadelphia Convention]] was composed of over fifty men, who spent an entire summer compromising and arguing over provisions that were interpreted very differently the moment the Constitution's text became public.{{ref|op1}} It is far from clear, therefore, that those fifty-plus men ''had'' – i.e., agreed upon – a single original intent of the text, or whether their purposes in drafting the Constitution were predicated on personal self-interest.{{ref|Beard}} (There is no meaning from an originalist perspective without intent. That is, it is impossible to interpret anything which has no intent, according to originalism. Lawmakers either have no intent, one intent, or multiple intents. But these multiple intents are always consistent, otherwise the law can have no meaning.)
* Even if the Convention did have a single, unified intent, it is unclear how it could reliably be determined from two centuries' distance. (That may be, but what &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; often be determined is that an interpretation being considered is inconsistent with the original intent even though the exact intent is not known.)
* Many of the clauses of the Constitution are relative, and thus specifically defy any claim that it is possible to divine a single, indisputable outcome to any specific problem or dispute. Key passages in the Constitution were originally cast as flexible evaluations, such as "due process," a phrase that suggests the definitions, requirements and dimensions of court or other governmental proceedings sufficient in any given context to permit citizens to be deprived of their rights were never intended to be fixed forever. (A single indisputable decision is never the outcome using any other jurisprudence. This is an argument against making any decision at all. The judge must merely make his best effort to decide in a manner which is consistent with the intent of the framers or authors of legislation, so far as he can ascertain it.)
* In the case of [[Federal government of the United States|US Federal Law]], law is made by majority vote in two chambers, and is then signed by the [[President of the United States|President]]. 536 people are therefore potentially involved in this process, and not one of them needs to share the same intentions as any other of them in order to play their part in ratifying the bill. They need only vote; their vote will count the same if they share the same intent as their colleagues, if they do ''not'' share the intent of their colleagues, and indeed, if they ''have'' no particular intention, and are voting solely because their party whip handed them a note saying "be on the Senate floor at 9:36pm and say 'Aye'." Their vote will count even if they are falling-down drunk or if they have not even ''read'' the bill under consideration.{{ref|mm}} All of which is to say that giving effect to the intent of the legislature not only presumes that there '''is''' a singular intent – no less dubious an assertion where statutes are concerned than where the Constitution is – but, worse yet, the very diversity of these bodies may permit a judge to corrupt his inquiry by finding a floor statement or committee report which suggests an intent that the Judge thinks would be a good result.{{ref|leghist}} (The intent can be ascertained so far as the authors of the legislation or other less authoritative contemporary sources said what it was)
* Original intent may fall afoul of [[Legal formalism|formalist]] theories of law, which explicitly decline interest in how a law is made, an inquiry which is obviously at the core of an original intent inquiry.

* Original intent cannot be reconciled against [[Textualism]]. Most of those who are originalists in Constitutional matters are also textualists in statutory matters, and textualism rejects the value of the ''intentions'' of the legislature in passing a text.{{ref|scalia}} If one adopts originalism as an "error-correcting lens which fits over textualism to account for the passage of time," one cannot adopt an originalist theory which is incoherent with the underlying textualism.

==Other schools of thought==
In [[Canada]], the predominant school of thought for legal interpretation is the [[living tree doctrine]], under which interpretations can evolve along with the society, to deal with new conditions that were different or did not exist when the [[Constitution of Canada|Constitution]] was framed.

'''Photo manipulation''' involves [[image editing|transforming or altering]] a [[photograph]] using various methods and techniques to achieve desired results.  Some photo manipulations are considered skillful artwork while others are frowned upon as unethical practices, especially when used to deceive the public, such as that used for political [[propaganda]], or to make a product or person look better.

Depending on the application and intent, some photo manipulations are considered an [[art form]] because it involves the creation of unique images and in some instances, signature expressions of art by photographic artists.  For example, [[Ansel Adams]] employed some of the more common manipulations using [[Burning and dodging|darkroom exposure techniques]], such as burning (darkening) and dodging (lightening) a photograph.&lt;ref name=Dziamba&gt;{{cite web | url = https://whitherthebook.wordpress.com/2013/02/27/ansel-adams-and-photography-before-photoshop/ | title = Ansel Adams, and Photography Before Photoshop | author = Jack Dziamba | date = February 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PBS"&gt;{{cite interview | title=Artbeat | date=November 29, 2012 | accessdate=January 30, 2016 | author=Mia Fineman | interviewer=Tom Legro | work=PBS Newshour | publisher=WPBT2 | location=South Florida | url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/art/slide-show-what-did-we-do-before-photoshop/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other examples of photo manipulation include retouching photographs using ink or paint, [[airbrushing]], [[double exposure (photography)|double exposure]], piecing photos or negatives together in the darkroom, scratching [[instant film]]s, or through the use of software-based manipulation tools applied to digital images.  There are a number of software applications available for digital image manipulation, ranging from professional applications to very basic imaging software for casual users.

Photo manipulation dates back to some of the earliest photographs captured on [[ambrotype|glass]] and [[tintype|tin plates]] during the [[19th century]].  The practice began not long after the creation of the first photograph (1825) by [[Joseph Nicéphore Niépce]] who developed [[heliography]] and made the first photographic print from a photoengraved printing plate.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1885093.stm | publisher = BBC News | date = 21 March 2002 | title = World's oldest photo sold to library | quote = The image of an engraving depicting a man leading a horse was made in 1825 by Nicephore Niepce, who invented a technique known as heliogravure. | accessdate = 2011-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Farid&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~beki/cs4001/history.pdf/ | title = Photo Tampering Throughout History | first = Hany | last = Farid | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150908155915/http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~beki/cs4001/history.pdf | archivedate = September 8, 2015 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional photographic prints can be altered using various methods and techniques that involve manipulation directly to the print, such as retouching with ink, paint, [[airbrush]]ing, or scratching [[Polaroid Corporation|Polaroids]] during developing.&lt;ref name=Scratch&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pola-art.de/technique/ | title=How to manipulate SX-70? | work = Polaroid SX-70 Art | publisher = Skylab Portfolio | editor = Klaus Wolfer | accessdate = February 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Negatives can be manipulated while still in the camera using double-exposure techniques, or in the [[darkroom]] by piecing photos or negatives together.  Some darkroom manipulations involved techniques such as bleaching to artfully lighten or totally wash-out parts of the photograph, or hand coloring for aesthetic purposes or to mimic a fine art painting.&lt;ref name="Warren"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=31VsBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1007&amp;lpg=PA1007&amp;dq=Darkroom+manipulations+are+traditional+art&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jUu90y8I9B&amp;sig=kvs9Yqgq1XxCNdql9kzwCuunev4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj03Nm4sNLKAhVFWCYKHSqrAwgQ6AEIKTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Darkroom%20manipulations%20are%20traditional%20art&amp;f=false | title=Encyclopedia of Twentieth-Century Photography, 3-Volume Set | publisher=Routledge | author=Lynne Warren | authorlink=Robert Maplethorpe | year=2006 | pages=1007 | isbn=9781135205362}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 19th century, photography and the technology that made it possible was rather crude and cumbersome. While the equipment and technology progressed over time, it was not until the late [[20th century]] that photography evolved into the digital realm. At the onset, digital photography was considered by some to be a radical new approach, and was initially rejected by photographers because of its substandard quality.&lt;ref name="Peres"&gt;{{cite book|last=Peres|first=Michael|title=The Focal Encyclopedia of Photography, Fourth Edition|year=2007|publisher=Focal Press; 4 edition|isbn=0-240-80740-5|page= Preface, 24|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VYyldcYfq3MC&amp;pg=PR23#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=January 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transition from film to digital has been an ongoing process although great strides were made in the early 21st century as a result of advancing technology that has greatly improved digital image quality while reducing the bulk and weight of cameras and equipment.&lt;ref name=Adobe&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.adobe.com/digitalimag/pdfs/phscs2ip_filmtodig.pdf | publisher = Adobe Systems Incorporated | title = Making The Transition From Film To Digital |author-first=Michael |author-last=Reichmann |author-link=Michael Reichmann | date = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early manipulation===
An early example of tampering was in the early 1860s, when a photo of [[Abraham Lincoln]] was altered using the body from a portrait of [[John C. Calhoun]] and the head of Lincoln from a famous seated portrait by [[Mathew Brady]] – the [[United States five-dollar bill#The redesigned .245 bill|same portrait]] which was the basis for the [[United States five-dollar bill#Small size note history|original]] Lincoln [[United States five-dollar bill|five-dollar bill]].&lt;ref name=Farid/&gt;  Another is exampled in the [[Library of Congress]] ''Prints and Photographs Online Catalogue'' wherein it exposes a manipulated [[American Civil War]] photograph of [[General Ulysses S. Grant]] posing horseback in front of his troops at [[City Point, Virginia]].&lt;ref name=LOC&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/cwp/mystery.html | title=Civil War Glass Negatives and Related Prints – Solving a Civil War Photograph Mystery | publisher = [[Library of Congress]] | accessdate=January 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Close observation of the photograph raises questions and brings to light certain details in the photograph that simply do not add up. For example, Grant's head is set at a strange angle to his body, his uniform is of a different time period, and his favorite horse [[Cincinnati (horse)|Cincinnati]] did not have a left hind sock like the horse in the photograph, although his other horse Egypt did have a sock but on a different foot. With further research, three different photographs were discovered that explained the composite using Grant's head from one photograph, the body of [[Alexander McDowell McCook|Major General Alexander McDowell McCook]] atop his horse from another photograph, and for the background, an 1864 photograph of [[Confederate Army of the Shenandoah|Confederate prisoners]] captured at the [[Battle of Fisher's Hill]].&lt;ref name=LOC/&gt;

In the 20th century, digital retouching became available with [[Quantel]] computers running [[Quantel Paintbox|Paintbox]] in professional environments,&lt;ref name=Sasso&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q-I2M80f7KwC&amp;pg=PA124&amp;lpg=PA124&amp;dq=digital+retouching+with+Quantel+computers&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-XxMvomiqd&amp;sig=nHuh9O8oHmq5Wfrp89VfzxJqUfQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiLvNH7x9LKAhXLQyYKHcikBAMQ6AEIQzAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=digital%20retouching%20with%20Quantel%20computers&amp;f=false | title = Abduzeedo Inspiration Guide for Designers | author = Fabio Sasso | publisher = Pearson Education | page = 124 | isbn = 9780132684729|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which, alongside other contemporary packages, were effectively replaced in the market by [[Adobe Photoshop]] and other editing software for [[Graphic image developer|graphic imaging]].

==Political and ethical issues==

Photo manipulation has been used to deceive or persuade viewers or improve storytelling and self-expression.&lt;ref name="Rotman"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qQE0OLSIXsEC&amp;pg=PA96&amp;lpg=PA96&amp;dq=photograph+has+an+inherent+verisimilitude&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jK-70MnrPz&amp;sig=UBZKrOzqpvyLfuqnQLbRO2u4Gew&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi3oqSs5sXKAhXEupQKHRoBD2YQ6AEINzAF#v=onepage&amp;q=photograph%20has%20an%20inherent%20verisimilitude&amp;f=false | title=Becoming Beside Ourselves: The Alphabet, Ghosts, and Distributed Human Being | publisher=Duke University Press | author=Rotman, Brian | year=2008 | pages=96–97 | isbn=978-0822341833}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often even subtle and discreet changes can have a profound impact on how we interpret or judge a photograph, making it all the more important to know when or if manipulation has occurred.  As early as the American Civil War, photographs were published as engravings based on more than one negative.&lt;ref name="Palmquist"&gt;{{cite book | title=Pioneer Photographers from the Mississippi to the Continental Divide: A Biographical Dictionary, 1839-1865 | publisher=Stanford University Press | author=Peter E. Palmquist, Thomas R. Kailbourn | year=2005 | pages=55 | isbn=978-0804740579}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph Stalin]] made use of photo retouching for propaganda purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=King |first=D. |year=1997 |title=The Commissar Vanishes: the falsification of photographs and art in Stalin's Russia |publisher=Metropolitan Books |location=New York |isbn=0-8050-5294-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On May 5, 1920 his predecessor [[Vladimir Lenin]] held a speech for Soviet troops that [[Leon Trotsky]] attended. Stalin had Trotsky retouched out of a photograph showing Trotsky in attendance.&lt;ref name="Ammann"&gt;{{cite book | first=Daniel |last=Ammann | title=[[The King of Oil: The Secret Lives of Marc Rich]] | publisher=Macmillan | year=2009 | pages=228 | isbn=978-1429986854}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a well known case of ''[[damnatio memoriae]]'' image manipulation, [[NKVD]] leader [[Nikolai Yezhov]] (the "Vanishing Commissar"), after his execution in 1940, was removed from an official press photo where he was pictured with Stalin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newseum.org/berlinwall/commissar_vanishes/vanishes.htm|title="The Commissar Vanishes" in The Vanishing Commissar|author=The Newseum|date=Sep 1, 1999|accessdate=September 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (For more information, see [[Censorship of images in the Soviet Union]].)
The pioneer among journalists distorting photographic images for news value was [[Bernarr Macfadden]]: in the mid-1920s, his "[[composograph]]" process involved reenacting real news events with costumed [[body double]]s and then photographing the dramatized scenes—then pasting faces of the real news-personalities (gathered from unrelated photos) onto his staged images. In the 1930s, artist [[John Heartfield]] used a type of photo manipulation known as the [[photomontage]] to critique [[propaganda in Nazi Germany|Nazi propaganda]].

Some ethical theories have been applied to image manipulation. During a panel on the topic of ethics in image manipulation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | url = http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1179176 | title = Ethics in image manipulation | conference = International Conference on Computer Graphics and Interactive Techniques | year = 2006 | isbn = 1-59593-364-6 | first1 = Kathryn | last1 = Carlson | first2 = Brian | last2 = DeLevie | first3 = Aude | last3 = Oliva | doi = 10.1145/1179171.1179176 | publisher=[[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] | booktitle = ACM SIGGRAPH 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aude Oliva]] theorized that categorical shifts are necessary in order for an edited image to be viewed as a manipulation. In ''Image Act Theory'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | last = Reynolds | first = C. J. | title = Image Act Theory | conference = Seventh International Conference of Computer Ethics | date = July 12–14, 2007 | url = http://www.k2.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/members/carson/papers/reynolds_cepe2007.pdf | format = [[PDF]] | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080528064429/http://www.k2.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/members/carson/papers/reynolds_cepe2007.pdf | archivedate = May 28, 2008 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Carson Reynolds extended [[speech act]] theory by applying it to photo editing and image manipulations. In "How to Do Things with Pictures",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapterurl = http://www.stanford.edu/class/history34q/readings/Mitchell/MitchellHow.html | chapter =  How to Do Things with Pictures | first = William John | last = Mitchell |authorlink=William J. Mitchell| title = The Reconfigured Eye: Visual Truth in the Post-Photographic Era | publisher=MIT Press | year = 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William J. Mitchell]] details the long history of photo manipulation and discusses it critically.

=== Use in journalism ===
{{see also|Photojournalism#Ethical and legal considerations}}
A notable incident of controversial photo manipulation occurred over a photograph that was altered to fit the vertical orientation of a 1982 ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' magazine cover.  The altered image made two [[Egyptian pyramids]] appear closer together than they actually were in the original photograph.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/11/04/magazine/photography-s-new-bag-of-tricks.html?pagewanted=4|publisher=The New York Times Company | date=November 4, 1984 | author=Fred Ritchin | title=Photography's New Bag Of Tricks | accessdate=January 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident triggered a debate about the appropriateness of falsifying an image,&lt;ref name=BRONXDOC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alteredimagesbdc.org/national-geographic/ | title=National Geographic — Altered Images | publisher=Bronx Documentary Center | accessdate=January 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and raised questions regarding the magazine's credibility.  Shortly after the incident, Tom Kennedy, director of photography for ''National Geographic'' stated,  "We no longer use that technology to manipulate elements in a photo simply to achieve a more compelling graphic effect. We regarded that afterwards as a mistake, and we wouldn’t repeat that mistake today."&lt;ref name=BRONXDOC/&gt;

There are other incidents of questionable photo manipulation in journalism.  One such incident arose in early 2005 after [[Martha Stewart]] was released from prison. ''[[Newsweek]]'' used a photograph of Stewart's face on the body of a much slimmer woman for their cover, suggesting that Stewart had lost weight while in prison.&lt;ref name= NYT2005&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/03/business/media/martha-stewart-gets-new-body-in-newsweek.html?_r=0 | title = Martha Stewart Gets New Body In Newsweek | publisher=New York Times | author =  Jonathan D. Glater | date=March 3, 2005 | accessdate=January 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking about the incident in an interview, Lynn Staley, assistant managing editor at ''Newsweek'' said, "The piece that we commissioned was intended to show Martha as she would be, not necessarily as she is." Staley also explained that ''Newsweek'' disclosed on page 3 that the cover image of Martha Stewart was a composite.&lt;ref name=NYT2005/&gt;

Image manipulation software has affected the level of trust many viewers once had in the aphorism, the camera never lies.&lt;ref name=IntlNYT2004&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/11/technology/the-camera-never-lies-but-the-software-can.html | title=The Camera Never Lies, But The Software Can | publisher= The New York Times Company | author = Katie Hefner | date=March 11, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Images may be manipulated for fun, aesthetic reasons, or to improve the appearance of a subject&lt;ref name=Photo&gt;{{cite book|last=Kitchin|first=Rob|title=Code/Space: Software and Everyday Life|year=2011|publisher=The MIT Press|isbn=0-262-04248-7|chapter=6 | page=120|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZHez2BXgIeQC&amp;pg=PA120}}&lt;/ref&gt; but not all image manipulation is innocuous as evidenced by the [[Kerry Fonda 2004 election photo controversy]]. The image in question was a fraudulent composite image of [[John Kerry]] taken on June 13, 1971 and [[Jane Fonda]] taken in August, 1972 sharing the same platform at a 1971 antiwar rally; the latter of which carried a fake [[Associated Press]] credit with the intent to change the public's perspective of reality.&lt;ref name="IntlNYT2004"/&gt;

There is a growing body of writings devoted to the ethical use of digital editing in [[photojournalism]]. In the United States, for example, the [[National Press Photographers Association]] (NPPA) established a Code of Ethics which promotes the accuracy of published images, advising that photographers "do not manipulate images [...] that can mislead viewers or misrepresent subjects."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://nppa.org/code_of_ethics | title = NPPA Code of Ethics | publisher=[[National Press Photographers Association]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infringements of the Code are taken very seriously, especially regarding digital alteration of published photographs, as evidenced by a case in which [[Pulitzer prize]]-nominated photographer [[Allan Detrich]] resigned his post following the revelation that a number of his photographs had been manipulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.pdnonline.com/pdn/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003571795 | title = Blade Editor: Detrich Submitted 79 Altered Photos This Year | work=[[Photo District News]] | date = April 15, 2007 | first = Daryl | last = Lang}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, a Ukrainian photographer Stepan Rudik, winner of the 3rd prize story in Sports Features, has been disqualified due to violation of the rules of the [[World Press Photo of the Year|World Press Photo]] contest. "After requesting [[Raw image format|RAW-files]] of the series from him, it became clear that an element had been removed from one of the original photographs."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Announcement of disqualification|url = http://www.worldpressphoto.org/news/2010-03-03/announcement-disqualification|website = World Press Photo|access-date = 2016-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2015, up to 20%&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = World Press Photo Organizer: 20% of Finalists Disqualified|url = http://time.com/3706626/world-press-photo-processing-manipulation-disqualified/|website = TIME.com|access-date = 2016-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; of World Press Photo entries that made it to the penultimate round of the contest were disqualified after they were found to have been manipulated or post-processed with rules violations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What counts as manipulation?|url = http://www.worldpressphoto.org/activities/photo-contest/verification-process/what-counts-as-manipulation|website = World Press Photo|access-date = 2016-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Use in the Fashion Industry  ===
The photo manipulation industry has often been accused of promoting or inciting a distorted and unrealistic image of self; most specifically in younger people. The world of [[glamour photography]] is one specific industry which has been heavily involved with the use of photo manipulation (what many consider to be a concerning element as many people look up to celebrities in search of embodying the 'ideal figure').&lt;ref name=photo/&gt;  Manipulation of a photo to alter a model’s appearance can be used to change features such as skin complexion, hair color, body shape, and other features.  Many of the alterations to skin involve removing blemishes through the use of the healing tool in Photoshop.  Photo editors may also alter the color of hair to remove roots or add shine.  Additionally, the model’s teeth and eyes may be made to look whiter than they are in reality. [[Cosmetics|Make up]] and [[body piercing|piercings]] can even be edited into pictures to look as though the model was wearing them when the photo was taken.  Through photo editing, the appearance of a model may be drastically changed to mask imperfections.&lt;ref&gt;Metzmacher, Dirk. "Smashing Magazine." Smashing Magazine. N.p., n.d. Web. April 16, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article entitled, Confessions of a Retoucher: how the modeling industry is harming women, a professional retoucher who has worked for mega-fashion brands shares the industry’s secrets. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/beauty/confessions-of-a-retoucher-how-the-modelling-industry-is-harming-women-20171006-gyvqf2.html|title=Confessions of a retoucher: how the modelling industry is harming women|last=Cage|first=Carolyn|date=2017-10-06|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Along with fixing imperfections like skin wrinkles and smoothing features, the size of the model is manipulated by either adding or subtracting visible weight. Reverse retouching is just as common as making models skinnier, “distorting the bodies of very thin models to make them appear more robust in a process called reverse retouching. It is almost worse than making someone slimmer because the image claims you can be at an unhealthy weight but still look healthy. In reality, you can't, you have to Photoshop it".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/beauty/confessions-of-a-retoucher-how-the-modelling-industry-is-harming-women-20171006-gyvqf2.html|title=Confessions of a retoucher: how the modelling industry is harming women|last=Cage|first=Carolyn|date=2017-10-06|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Reverse retouching includes eliminating shadows from protruding bones, adding flesh over body parts, color correcting, and removing hair generated for warmth from extreme weight loss. Professionals are saying that if an image is not label "not retouched," then the public can assume that photograph has been modified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/how-retouched-photos-impact-our-mental-health-2018-3|title=Here's how retouched photos impact our mental health|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the fashion industry continues to use photos that have been manipulated to idealize body types, there is a need for education about how unreal and unhealthy these images are and the negative implications they are promoting. 

=== Photo manipulation on social media ===
Not only are photos being manipulated by professionals for the media, but also with the rise of social media everyone has easy access to edit photos they post online.  Countless Apps have been created to allow smartphone user tools to modify personal images.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2017/01/12/health/girls-social-media-self-image-partner/index.html|title=How girls use social media to build up, break down self-image|last=Media|first=Caroline Knorr, Common Sense|work=CNN|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These apps allow people to edit virtually every aspect in the photo focusing on the face and body represented. With social media users and the younger generation being exposed to an extreme amount of imagery that has been manipulated the consequences have a negative impact as body ideals are unachievable.  Social media has the opportunity to be used as a platform for promoting healthy body image and unedited photos; the need for approval over social media has to be altered in the near future.  

===Celebrities against photo manipulation===
Photo manipulation has triggered negative responses from both viewers and celebrities. This has led to celebrities refusing to have their photos retouched in support of the [[American Medical Association]] that has decided that "[we] must stop exposing impressionable children and teenagers to advertisements portraying models with body types only attainable with the help of photo editing software"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/fashion/ama-takes-stand-photoshop-medical-association-altering-contributes-unrealistic-expectations-article-1.126921#ixzz1QUW2THCf|title=Photoshop contributes to unrealistic expectations of appropriate body image: AMA|website=NY Daily News|access-date=2016-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include [[Keira Knightley]], [[Brad Pitt]], [[Andy Roddick]], [[Jessica Simpson]], [[Lady Gaga]] and [[Zendaya]].

Brad Pitt had a photographer, [[Chuck Close]], take photos of him that emphasized all of his flaws. Chuck Close is known for his photos that emphasize all skin flaws of an individual. Pitt did so in an effort to speak out against media using photoshop and manipulating celebrities’ photos in an attempt to hide their flaws. Also, [[Kate Winslet]] spoke out against photo manipulation in media after ''[[GQ]]'' magazine altered her body, making it look unnaturally thin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Keep It Real Challenge: Photoshop's Impact on Body Image|date= 29 June 2012|accessdate=19 April 2015|url=http://info.umkc.edu/womenc/2012/06/29/keep-it-real-challenge-photoshops-impact-on-body-image/|website=info.umkc.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2010, [[Britney Spears]] agreed to release "un-airbrushed images of herself next to the digitally altered ones".&lt;ref name=photo&gt;{{cite news|title=Britney Spears bravely agrees to release un-airbrushed images of herself next to the digitally-altered versions|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1265676/Britney-Spears-releases-airbrushed-images-digitally-altered-versions.html|accessdate=March 23, 2012|newspaper=Daily Mail|date=April 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fundamental motive behind her move was to "highlight the pressure exerted on women to look perfect".&lt;ref name=photo/&gt;

In addition, 42-year-old [[Cate Blanchett]] also appeared on the cover of [[1843 (magazine)|''Intelligent Life'']]'s 2012 March/April issue, makeup-free and without digital retouching for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Roberts|first=Soraya|title=Cate Blanchett goes without digital enhancement on the cover of Intelligent Life|url=http://ca.omg.yahoo.com/blogs/the-juice-celeb-news/cate-blanchett-goes-without-digital-enhancement-cover-intelligent-154517034.html|publisher=The Juice|accessdate=March 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Companies against photo manipulation===
Multiple companies have begun taking the initiative to speak out against the use of photo manipulation when advertising their products. Two companies that have done so include [[Dove (toiletries)|Dove]] and [[Aerie (American Eagle Outfitters)|Aerie]]. Dove created the Dove Self-Esteem Fund and also the [[Dove Campaign for Real Beauty]] as a way to try to help build confidence in young women. They want to emphasize what is known as real beauty, or untouched photographs, in the media now.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Evolution Video – Dove Self Esteem Project|website=selfesteem.dove.us|date= 2 June 2013|accessdate=1 May 2015|url=http://selfesteem.dove.us/Articles/Video/Evolution_video_how_images_of_beauty_are_manipulated_by_the_media.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, Aerie has started their campaign #AerieREAL. They have a line of undergarments now that goes by that name with the intention of them being for everyone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Aerie for American Eagle|accessdate=1 May 2015|url=http://www.ae.com/featured-aeriereal/aerie/s-cat/6890055}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, their advertisements state that the model has not been retouched in any way. They also add in their advertisements that "The real you is sexy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Krupnick|first=Ellie|title=Aerie's Unretouched Ads 'Challenge Supermodel Standards' For Young Women|newspaper= The Huffington Post|date=17 January 2014|accessdate=1 May 2015|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/17/aerie-unretouched-ads-photos_n_4618139.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, the American Medical Association has taken a stand against the use of photo manipulation. Dr. McAneny made a statement that altering models to such extremes creates unrealistic expectations in children and teenagers regarding body image. He also said that we should stop altering the models so they are not exposed to body types that can be attained only through the use of editing the photos. The American Medical Associations as a whole adopted a policy to work with advertisers to work on setting up guidelines for advertisements to try to limit how much photoshop is used. The goal of this policy is to limit the amount of unrealistic expectations for body image in advertisement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AMA Adopts New Policies at Annual Meeting|date=21 June 2011|website=ama-assn.org|accessdate=19 April 2015|url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/news/news/a11-new-policies.page}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Governments against excessive photo manipulation ===
Governments are exerting pressure on advertisers, and are starting to ban photos that are too airbrushed and edited. In the United Kingdom the [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] has banned an advertisement by [[Lancôme]] featuring [[Julia Roberts]] for being misleading, stating that the flawless skin seen in the photo was too good to be true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zhang|first=Michael|title=Julia Roberts Makeup Ads Banned in UK for Too Much Photoshop|url=http://www.petapixel.com/2011/07/27/julia-roberts-makeup-ads-banned-in-uk-for-too-much-photoshop/|publisher=PetaPixel|accessdate=July 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The US is also moving in the direction of banning excessive photo manipulation where a [[CoverGirl]] model's ad  was banned because it had exaggerated effects, leading to a misleading representation of the product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Anthony|first=Sebastian|title=US watchdog bans photoshopping in cosmetics ads|url=http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/109375-us-bans-photoshop-use-in-cosmetics-ads|accessdate=December 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Support for photo manipulation in media===
Some editors of magazine companies do not view manipulating their [[cover model]]s as an issue. In an interview with the editor of the French magazine ''[[Marie Claire]]'', she stated that their readers are not idiots and that they can tell when a model has been retouched. Also, some who support photo manipulation in the media state that the altered photographs are not the issue, but that it is the expectations that viewers have that they fail to meet, such as wanting to have the same body as a celebrity on the cover of their favorite magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In Defense of Photoshop: Why Retouching Isn't As Evil As Everyone Thinks|work= The Cut|date=29 August 2010|accessdate=19 April 2015|url=http://nymag.com/thecut/2010/08/photoshop_retouching.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Surveys done about photo manipulation===
Surveys have been done to see how photo manipulation affects society and to see what society thinks of it. One survey was done by a fashion store in the United Kingdom, [[New Look (company)|New Look]], and it showed that 90% of the individuals surveyed would prefer seeing a wider variety of body shapes in media. This would involve them wanting to see cover models that are not all thin, but some with more curves than others. The survey also talked about how readers view the use of photo manipulation. One statistic stated that 15% of the readers believed that the cover images are accurate depictions of the model in reality. Also, they found that 33% of women who were surveyed are aiming for a body that is impossible for them to attain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Women Need Further Educating Into Extent of Digital Manipulation of Mo|website=prweb.com|date= 26 November 2013|accessdate=19 April 2015|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2013/11/prweb11361783.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dove also did a survey to see how photo manipulation affects the self-esteem of females. In doing this, they found that 80% of the women surveyed felt insecure when seeing photos of celebrities in the media. Of the women surveyed who had lower self-esteem, 71% of them do not believe that their appearance is pretty or stylish enough in comparison to cover models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Self Esteem Act: Parents Push for Anti-Photoshop Law in U.S. to Protect Teens from Unrealistic Body Image Ideals|publisher=Daily Mail Online|work=Associated Newspapers|date=12 October 2011|accessdate=19 April 2015|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2048375/Self-Esteem-Act-US-parents-push-anti-Photoshop-laws-advertising.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social and cultural implications ===

The growing popularity of image manipulation has raised concern as to whether it allows for unrealistic images to be portrayed to the public. In her article "[[On Photography]]" (1977), [[Susan Sontag]] discusses the objectivity, or lack thereof, in photography, concluding that "photographs, which fiddle with the scale of the world, themselves get reduced, blown up, cropped, retouched, doctored and tricked out".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Sontag | first = Susan | authorlink = Susan Sontag | year = 1977 | title = [[On Photography]] | page = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A practice widely used in the magazine industry, the use of photo manipulation on an already subjective photograph, creates a constructed reality for the individual and it can become difficult to differentiate fact from fiction. With the potential to alter body image, debate continues as to whether manipulated images, particularly those in magazines, contribute to self-esteem issues in both men and women.

In today's world, photo manipulation has a positive impact by developing the creativity of one's mind or maybe a negative one by removing the art and beauty of capturing something so magnificent and natural or the way it should be. According to ''[[HuffPost|The Huffington Post]]'', "Photoshopping and airbrushing, many believe, are now an inherent part of the beauty industry, as are makeup, lighting and styling".  In a way, these image alterations are "selling" actual people to the masses to affect responses, reactions, and emotions toward these cultural icons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=L. Boutwell|first=Allison|title=Photoshop: A Positive and Negative Innovation|url=http://allisonlboutwell.wordpress.com/2012/02/05/photoshopapositiveandnegativeinnovation/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of digital photo manipulation ==
In digital editing, photographs are usually taken with a [[digital camera]] and input directly into a computer. [[reversal film|Transparencies]], [[Negative (photography)|negatives]] or printed photographs may also be [[digitized]] using a [[Image scanner|scanner]], or images may be obtained from [[stock photography]] databases. With the advent of computers, [[graphics tablet]]s, and digital cameras, the term ''image editing'' encompasses everything that can be done to a photo, whether in a [[darkroom]] or on a computer. Photo manipulation is often much more explicit than subtle alterations to color balance or contrast and may involve overlaying a head onto a different body or changing a sign's text, for examples. Image editing software can be used to apply effects and warp an image until the desired result is achieved. The resulting image may have little or no resemblance to the photo (or photos in the case of [[compositing]]) from which it originated. Today, photo manipulation is widely accepted as an [[art form]].

There are several subtypes of digital image-retouching:

;Technical retouching: Manipulation for photo restoration or enhancement. This can involve the adjustment of colors, contrast, [[white balance]] (i.e. gradational retouching) and sharpness, and the removal of noise, elements or visible flaws on skin or materials.

;Creative retouching: Used as an art form or for commercial use to create more sleek and interesting images for advertisements. Creative retouching could be manipulation for fashion, beauty or advertising photography such as pack-shots (which could also be considered inherently technical retouching in regards to package dimensions and wrap-around factors). One of the most prominent disciplines in creative retouching is image compositing whereby the digital artist uses multiple photos to create a single image. Today, [[3D computer graphics]] are used more and more to add extra elements or even locations and backgrounds. This kind of image composition is widely used when conventional photography would be technically too difficult or impossible to shoot on location or in studio.

As a result of the popularity of Adobe Photoshop as image editing software, use of the neologism "photoshopped" grew ubiquitously.

In popular culture, the term ''photoshopping'' is sometimes associated with [[Photomontage|montages]] in the form of visual jokes, such as those published on [[Fark]] and in ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' magazine.

A belief in the '''primacy of mind''' is {{cns|an ubiquitous element in the [[history of ideas]]|date=November 2018}}. In this view the [[mind]] or [[soul]] is not only [[Idealism|primary as an explanation of reality]], but is the only conceivable explanation, as nothing so subtle and sublime as reason and morality could possibly [[Materialism|emerge from matter and motion]], the primary elements of scientific explanation.{{cn|date=November 2018}} In his book ''[[Darwin's Dangerous Idea]]'', [[Daniel Dennett]] states that a central aspect of Judeo-Christian and Islamic [[cosmogony]] is that, in the beginning, there was "something with Mind—'a cogitative Being,'".&lt;ref&gt;Dennett, D. C., ''[[Darwin's Dangerous Idea: Evolution and the Meanings of Life]]'', 1995, p26, {{ISBN|0-684-82471-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6347">In [[mathematics]], '''quaternionic projective space''' is an extension of the ideas of [[real projective space]] and [[complex projective space]], to the case where coordinates lie in the ring of [[quaternion]]s &lt;math&gt;\H.&lt;/math&gt; Quaternionic projective space of dimension ''n'' is usually denoted by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{HP}^n&lt;/math&gt;

and is a [[closed manifold]] of (real) dimension 4''n''. It is a [[homogeneous space]] for a [[Lie group]] action, in more than one way. The quaternionic projective line &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{HP}^1&lt;/math&gt; is homeomorphic to the 4-sphere.

==In coordinates==
Its direct construction is as a special case of the [[projective space over a division algebra]]. The [[homogeneous coordinates]] of a point can be written

:&lt;math&gt;[q_0,q_1,\ldots,q_n]&lt;/math&gt;

where the &lt;math&gt;q_i&lt;/math&gt; are quaternions, not all zero. Two sets of coordinates represent the same point if they are 'proportional' by a left multiplication by a non-zero quaternion ''c''; that is, we identify all the

:&lt;math&gt;[cq_0,cq_1\ldots,cq_n]&lt;/math&gt;.

In the language of [[group action]]s, &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{HP}^n&lt;/math&gt; is the [[orbit space]] of &lt;math&gt;\H^{n+1}\setminus\{(0,\ldots,0)\}&lt;/math&gt; by the action of &lt;math&gt;\H^{\times}&lt;/math&gt;, the multiplicative group of non-zero quaternions. By first projecting onto the unit sphere inside &lt;math&gt;\H^{n+1}&lt;/math&gt; one may also regard &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{HP}^{n}&lt;/math&gt; as the orbit space of &lt;math&gt;S^{4n+3}&lt;/math&gt; by the action of &lt;math&gt;\text{Sp}(1)&lt;/math&gt;, the group of unit quaternions.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory L. Naber, ''Topology, geometry, and gauge fields: foundations'' (1997), p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; The sphere &lt;math&gt;S^{4n+3}&lt;/math&gt; then becomes a [[principal bundle|principal Sp(1)-bundle]] over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{HP}^n&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Sp}(1) \to S^{4n+3} \to \mathbb{HP}^n.&lt;/math&gt;

This bundle is sometimes called a (generalized) [[Hopf fibration]].

There is also a construction of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{HP}^{n}&lt;/math&gt; by means of two-dimensional complex subspaces of &lt;math&gt;\H^{2n}&lt;/math&gt;, meaning that &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{HP}^{n}&lt;/math&gt; lies inside a complex [[Grassmannian]].

==Topology==
===Homotopy theory===
The space &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{HP}^{\infty}&lt;/math&gt;, defined as the union of all finite &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{HP}^n&lt;/math&gt;'s under inclusion, is the [[classifying space]] ''BS''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. The homotopy groups of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{HP}^{\infty}&lt;/math&gt; are given by &lt;math&gt;\pi_i(\mathbb{HP}^{\infty}) = \pi_i(BS^3) \cong \pi_{i-1}(S^3).&lt;/math&gt; These groups are known to be very complex and in particular they are non-zero for infinitely many values of &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;. However, we do have that

:&lt;math&gt;\pi_i(\mathbb{HP}^\infty) \otimes \Q \cong \begin{cases} \Q &amp; i = 4 \\ 0 &amp; i \neq 4 \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

It follows that rationally, i.e. after [[localisation of a space]], &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{HP}^\infty&lt;/math&gt; is an [[Eilenberg–Maclane space]] &lt;math&gt;K(\Q,4)&lt;/math&gt;. That is &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{HP}^{\infty}_{\Q} \simeq K(\Z, 4)_{\Q}.&lt;/math&gt; (cf. the example [[K(Z,2)]]). See [[rational homotopy theory]].

In general, &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{HP}^n&lt;/math&gt; has a cell structure with one cell in each dimension which is a multiple of 4, up to &lt;math&gt;4n&lt;/math&gt;. Accordingly, its cohomology ring is &lt;math&gt;\Z[v]/v^{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is a 4-dimensional generator. This is analogous to complex projective space. It also follows from rational homotopy theory that &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{HP}^n&lt;/math&gt; has infinite homotopy groups only in dimensions 4 and &lt;math&gt;4n+3&lt;/math&gt;.

==Differential geometry==

&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{HP}^n&lt;/math&gt; carries a natural [[Riemannian metric]] analogous to the [[Fubini-Study metric]] on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{CP}^n&lt;/math&gt;, with respect to which it is a compact [[quaternion-Kähler symmetric space]] with positive curvature.

Quaternionic projective space can be represented as the coset space

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{HP}^n = \operatorname{Sp}(n+1)/\operatorname{Sp}(n)\times\operatorname{Sp}(1)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Sp}(n)&lt;/math&gt; is the compact [[symplectic group]].

===Characteristic classes===

Since &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{HP}^1=S^4&lt;/math&gt;, its tangent bundle is stably trivial. The tangent bundles of the rest have nontrivial [[Stiefel–Whitney class|Stiefel–Whitney]] and [[Pontryagin class]]es. The total classes are given by the following formula:

:&lt;math&gt;w(\mathbb{HP}^n) = (1+u)^{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;p(\mathbb{HP}^n) = (1+v)^{2n+2} (1+4v)^{-1} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the generator of &lt;math&gt;H^4(\mathbb{HP}^n;\Z)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is its reduction mod 2.&lt;ref&gt;Szczarba, R. H. (1964). On tangent bundles of fibre spaces and quotient spaces. American Journal of Mathematics, 86(4), 685-697.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Special cases==

===Quaternionic projective line===
The one-dimensional projective space over &lt;math&gt;\H&lt;/math&gt; is called the "projective line" in generalization of the [[complex projective line]]. For example, it was used (implicitly) in 1947 by P. G. Gormley to extend the [[Möbius group]] to the quaternion context with "linear fractional transformations". For the linear fractional transformations of an associative [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] with 1, see [[projective line over a ring]] and the homography group GL(2,''A'').

From the topological point of view the quaternionic projective line is the 4-sphere, and in fact these are [[diffeomorphic]] manifolds. The fibration mentioned previously is from the 7-sphere, and is an example of a [[Hopf fibration]].

===Quaternionic projective plane===
The 8-dimensional &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{HP}^{2}&lt;/math&gt; has a [[circle action]], by the group of complex scalars of absolute value 1 acting on the other side (so on the right, as the convention for the action of ''c'' above is on the left). Therefore, the [[quotient manifold]]

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{HP}^{2}/\mathrm{U}(1)&lt;/math&gt;

may be taken, writing [[U(1)]] for the [[circle group]]. It has been shown that this quotient is the 7-[[sphere]], a result of [[Vladimir Arnold]] from 1996, later rediscovered by [[Edward Witten]] and [[Michael Atiyah]].

{{Democracy}}
'''Radical democracy''' was articulated by [[Ernesto Laclau]] and [[Chantal Mouffe]] in their book ''[[Hegemony and Socialist Strategy|Hegemony and Socialist Strategy: Towards a Radical Democratic Politics]]'', written in 1985.  They argue that [[social movements]] which attempt to create [[social change|social and political change]] need a strategy which challenges [[neoliberal]] and [[neoconservative]] concepts of [[democracy]].&lt;ref name="hegemony"&gt;Laclau, E and Mouffe, C. (1985). ''Hegemony and Socialist Strategy: Towards a Radical Democratic Politics'', Verso: London.&lt;/ref&gt; This strategy is to expand the [[Liberalism|liberal]] definition of democracy, based on [[Freedom (political)|freedom]] and [[Equality before the law|equality]], to include [[Difference (philosophy)|difference]].&lt;ref name="hegemony" /&gt;

"Radical democracy" means "the root of democracy".  Laclau and Mouffe claim that [[liberal democracy]] and [[deliberative democracy]], in their attempts to build [[consensus]], oppress differing opinions, races, classes, genders, and worldviews.&lt;ref name="hegemony"/&gt;  In the world, in a country, and in a social movement there are many (a plurality of) differences which resist consensus.  Radical democracy is not only accepting of difference, [[dissent]] and antagonisms, but is dependent on it.&lt;ref name="hegemony" /&gt;  Laclau and Mouffe argue based on the assumption that there are oppressive [[Power (philosophy)|power]] relations that exist in society and that those oppressive relations should be made visible, re-negotiated and altered.&lt;ref name="hegemony" /&gt;  By building democracy around difference and dissent, oppressive power relations existing in societies are able to come to the forefront so that they can be challenged.&lt;ref&gt;Mouffe, C. (1996). ''Democracy, Power, and the ‘Political’''. In Benhabib, S. (ed.) Democracy and Difference (pp. 245-255). Princeton: University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In other contexts, radical democracy is a term used to refer to the [[post-Marxist]] perspectives of [[Italian Radicals (disambiguation)|Italian radicalism]]—especially [[Paolo Virno]].

== Re-interpretations ==
Since Laclau and Mouffe argued for a radical democracy, many other theorists and practitioners have  adapted and changed the term.  For example,  [[bell hooks]] and [[Henry Giroux]] have all written about education for a radical democracy. [[Paulo Freire]]'s work, although initiated decades before Laclau and Mouffe, can also be read through similar lenses. &lt;ref&gt;Freire, P. (2004). ''Pedagogy of Hope: Reliving Pedagogy of the Oppressed''. New York: Continuum.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;hooks, b. (1996). ''Representation and Democracy: An Interview''. In Trend, D. (ed.) Radical Democracy: Identity, Citizenship, and the State (pp. 228-236). New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Giroux, H. (1996). ''Pedagogy and Radical Democracy in the Age of “Political Correctness”''. In Trend, D. (ed.) Radical Democracy: Identity, Citizenship, and the State (pp. 179-194). New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Theorists such as [[Paul Chatterton]] and [[Richard JF Day]] have written about the importance of radical democracy within some of the autonomous movements in Latin America (namely the EZLN—[[Zapatista Army of National Liberation]] in Mexico, the MST—[[Landless Workers' Movement]] in Brazil, and the [[Piquetero]]—Unemployed Workers Movement in Argentina).&lt;ref&gt;Chatterton, P. ''Making Autonomous Geographies: Argentina’s Popular Uprising and the ‘Movimiento de Traebajadores Desocupados (Unemployed Workers Movement)'', Geoforum, (2005), Volume 36, Issue 5, pp. 545-61.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Day, R. (2005). ''[[Gramsci Is Dead: Anarchist Currents in the Newest Social Movements]]''. Between the lines: Toronto.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Challenges ==
Because of radical democracy's focus on difference, and challenging oppressive power relations, it has been seen as conducive to [[post-colonial theory]] and [[decolonization]].  However, the concept of radical democracy is seen in some circles as colonial in nature due to its reliance on a western notion of democracy.&lt;ref name="dhaliwal"&gt;Dhaliwal, A. (1996). ''Can the Subaltern Vote? Radical Democracy, Discourses of Representation and Rights, and Questions of Race.'' In Trend, D. (ed.) Radical Democracy: Identity, Citizenship, and the State (pp. 42-61). New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, radical democracy challenges [[consensus decision-making]] processes which are essential to many indigenous governing practices.&lt;ref name="dhaliwal" /&gt;

A '''Ragone plot''' (pronounced "ru-GO-nee")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.case.edu/its/archives/presidents/ragsummary.htm |title= President David V. Ragone |website= [[Case Western Reserve University]] |accessdate= 21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a plot used for performance comparison of various energy-storing devices. On such a [[chart]] the values of [[specific energy]] (in [[Watt-hour|W·h]]/[[kg]]) are plotted versus [[Power-to-weight ratio|specific power]] (in W/kg). Both axes are [[logarithmic scale|logarithmic]], which allows comparing performance of very different devices (for example, extremely high and extremely low power).

The Ragone plot was first used to compare performance of [[electric battery|batteries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|url= http://papers.sae.org/680453 |title= Review of Battery Systems for Electrically Powered Vehicles |first= D. V. |last= Ragone |journal= [[SAE International|SAE]] Technical Paper |id= 680453 |year=1968 |doi= 10.4271/680453}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is suitable to compare any energy-storing devices,&lt;ref name=Theory&gt;{{cite article |first1= Thomas |last= Christen |first2= Martin W. |last2= Carlen |year= 2000 |url= https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229122460_Theory_of_Ragone_plots |title= Theory of Ragone plots |journal= [[Journal of Power Sources]] |volume= 91 |issue= 2 |pages= 210&amp;ndash;216 |doi= 10.1016/S0378-7753(00)00474-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as is shown in the graph on the right.  The plot is named after [[David V. Ragone]].&lt;ref name=Theory /&gt;

Conceptually, the vertical axis describes how much [[energy]] is available, while the horizontal axis shows how quickly that energy can be delivered, otherwise known as [[Power (physics)|power]], per unit mass. A point in a Ragone plot thus represents the amount of time during which the energy (per mass) on the Y-axis can be delivered at the power (per mass) on the X-axis, and that time (in hours) is given as the ratio between the energy and the power densities. Consequently, the [[contour line|iso curves]] in a Ragone plot are straight lines with unity [[slope]]. For example, powering a small light bulb may require low amounts of power, but the power should be delivered steadily enough to operate a [[flashlight]] for minutes or hours of use.  Conversely, a high-speed [[transistor|electronic switch]] inside a [[computer]] may require very little energy to activate; yet it must be delivered rapidly enough to complete the transaction in mere [[microsecond]]s.  These two types of loads would be represented at opposite corners of the Ragone plot.{{Clarify|date=August 2017|reason=example plot does not show iso lines, "for example" example speaks of "loads", which are not ESDs, appearing on plot}}

:&lt;math&gt;\text{Specific Energy} = \frac{V \times I \times t}m,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\text{Specific Power} = \frac{V \times I}m,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''V'' is [[voltage]] (V), ''I'' [[electric current]] (A), ''t'' [[time]] (s) and ''m'' [[mass]] (kg).

'''Reproductive coercion''' (also called '''coerced reproduction''') is threats or acts of violence against a partner's reproductive health or reproductive decision-making and is a collection of behaviors intended to pressure or coerce a partner into initiating, keeping, or terminating a pregnancy.&lt;ref name=ACOG&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors =  | title = ACOG Committee opinion no. 554: reproductive and sexual coercion | journal = Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume = 121 | issue = 2 Pt 1 | pages = 411–5 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 23344307 | doi = 10.1097/01.AOG.0000426427.79586.3b | url = https://www.acog.org/Resources-And-Publications/Committee-Opinions/Committee-on-Health-Care-for-Underserved-Women/Reproductive-and-Sexual-Coercion | ref = harv | publisher = [[Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|LWW]] | postscript = . }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reproductive coercion is a form of [[domestic violence]], also known as [[intimate partner violence]], where behavior concerning [[reproductive health]] is used to maintain power, control, and domination within a relationship and over a partner through an unwanted pregnancy.  It is considered a serious public health issue.&lt;ref name=ACOG/&gt;&lt;ref name=FVPF/&gt; This reproductive control is highly correlated to [[unintended pregnancy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Coker AL | title = Does physical intimate partner violence affect sexual health? A systematic review | journal = Trauma, Violence &amp; Abuse | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 149–77 | date = April 2007 | pmid = 17545572 | doi = 10.1177/1524838007301162 | url = https://doi.org/10.1177/1524838007301162 | ref = harv | publisher = [[SAGE Publications|Sage]] | postscript = . }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common forms of reproductive coercion are pregnancy pressure, pregnancy coercion, and birth control sabotage; they can exist independently or occur simultaneously. Not complying with the partner's wishes may result in the partner acting out violently.&lt;ref name=ACOG/&gt; 

==Pregnancy pressure==
Pregnancy pressure is enacted by a woman's sexual partner when he pressures her into having unprotected sex in order to become pregnant, or into continuing or [[abortion|terminating the pregnancy]].&lt;ref name=ACOG /&gt; It might involve pregnancy coercion, which are threats or acts of violence if the woman does not comply with the perpetrator's demands or wishes.&lt;ref name=FVPF /&gt;&lt;ref name=Sueda&gt;{{cite web | first = Alexandra | last = Sueda | name-list-format = vanc | publisher = Department of Ob/Gyn, Kaiser Permanente | url =  http://www.stoptheviolence.org/files/Alexa_Sueda_-_Reproductive_Coercion.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160517210158/https://domesticviolenceactioncenter.org/files/Alexa_Sueda_-_Reproductive_Coercion.pdf | archive-date = 3 January 2012 | dead-url = yes | title = Contraceptive Coercion }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Miller E, Silverman JG | title = Reproductive coercion and partner violence: implications for clinical assessment of unintended pregnancy | journal = Expert Review of Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology | volume = 5 | issue = 5 | pages = 511–515 | date = September 2010 | pmid = 22355296 | pmc = 3282154 | doi = 10.1586/eog.10.44 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Reproductive pressure behaviors may result in several [[unintended pregnancies]] that are then followed by multiple [[forced abortion|coerced abortion]]s. Women who seek abortions are nearly three times as likely to have experienced reproductive pressure by a partner in the past year, compared to women continuing their pregnancies.&lt;ref name=FVPF /&gt; A [[Guttmacher Institute]] policy analysis states that forcing a woman to terminate a pregnancy she wants or to continue a pregnancy she does not want violates the basic human right of her [[reproductive health]].&lt;ref name=Guttmacher&gt;{{cite journal | last = Barot | first = Sneha | name-list-format = vanc | title = Governmental coercion in reproductive decision making: see it both ways | journal = [[Guttmacher Policy Review]] | volume = 15 | issue = 4 | publisher = [[Guttmacher Institute]]| date = Fall 2012 | url = http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/gpr/15/4/gpr150407.html | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Birth control sabotage==
Reproductive coercion can take the form of birth control sabotage, either as verbal sabotage, behavioral sabotage, and/or acts as an active interference with contraceptive methods.  Direct actions are taken to ensure the failure of birth control (such as poking holes in or breaking condoms) or complete removal of contraception (such as flushing birth control pills down the toilet or removing contraceptive rings or patches from the body).  Partners can also forbid women from using [[family planning]] or force them to have sex without protection.&lt;ref name=ACOG/&gt;&lt;ref name=FVPF/&gt;

Birth control sabotage is frequently associated with [[Domestic violence|physical]] or [[sexual violence]], and is a contributor to high pregnancy rates—especially [[teenage pregnancy]] rates—among abused, disadvantaged women and teenagers.&lt;ref name=FVPF/&gt;

Studies on the birth control sabotage performed by males against female partners have indicated a strong correlation between [[domestic violence]] and birth control sabotage. These studies have identified two main classes of the phenomenon:&lt;ref name=Teen/&gt;
*Verbal sabotage—verbal or emotional pressure not to use birth control or to become pregnant.
*Behavioral sabotage—the use of force to have unprotected sexual intercourse or not to use birth control.

14% of surveyed young mothers reported undergoing birth control sabotage.&lt;ref name=Teen&gt;''[http://www.impactresearch.org/documents/birthcontrolexecutive.pdf Domestic Violence and Birth Control Sabotage: A Report from the Teen Parent Project].'' Chicago: Center for Impact Research, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;  A separate study found that 66% of teen mothers on public assistance who had recently experienced intimate partner violence disclosed birth control sabotage by a dating partner.  When women did try to negotiate condom use with their abusive partners, 32% said they were verbally threatened,  21% reported physical abuse, and 14% said their partners threatened abandonment.&lt;ref name=FVPF /&gt;

Gender and sexual power dynamics and coercion associated with sexual power dynamics are both linked to condom nonuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hendriksen ES, Pettifor A, Lee SJ, Coates TJ, Rees HV | title = Predictors of condom use among young adults in South Africa: the Reproductive Health and HIV Research Unit National Youth Survey | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 97 | issue = 7 | pages = 1241–8 | date = July 2007 | pmid = 17538062 | pmc = 1913066 | doi = 10.2105/AJPH.2006.086009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Even women with high [[Sexually transmitted disease|STI]] knowledge are more likely to use condoms inconsistently than women with low STI knowledge when there is a high level of fear for abuse.&lt;ref name=FVPF /&gt;

==Teen pregnancy==
Teenage girls in physically violent relationships are 3.5 times more likely to become pregnant and are 2.8 times more likely to fear the possible consequences of negotiating condom use than non-abused girls. They are also half as likely to use condoms consistently compared to non-abused girls, and teenage boys perpetrating dating violence are also less likely to use condoms.&lt;ref name=FVPF /&gt; There are actions girls and women can take if their contraception has been [[stealthed]] or sabotaged:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brocail|first1=McKinzie | name-list-format = vanc |title=Stealthing &amp; Sabotaging Condoms: What You Need To Know|url=https://www.stdcheck.com/blog/stealthing-legal-what-to-do-after/|access-date=21 May 2017|work=STDcheck|date=10 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, Plan B (the morning after pill) can be acquired by girls 15 years or older. When taken within 72 hours, it can help prevent an unwanted pregnancy. It is approximately 95% effective when taken within 24 hours and is approximately 89% effective when taken within 72 hours.

Teenage mothers are nearly twice as likely to have a repeat pregnancy within 2 years if they experienced abuse within three months after delivery.&lt;ref name=FVPF /&gt;

26% of abused teenage girls reported that their boyfriends were trying to get them pregnant.&lt;ref name=FWV&gt;Futures Without Violence. Feb 27, 2012 [http://www.futureswithoutviolence.org/userfiles/file/HealthCare/Feb%2027%202012%20Final.pdf Teen Dating Violence and Reproductive Coercion: Innovative Opportunities for Programs and Partnerships]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevalence ==
[[Domestic violence]], also called "intimate partner violence", is monitored by the US [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC).  Their survey on domestic violence measures five types of domestic violence, including control of reproductive health, citing pregnancy pressure and birth control sabotage specifically.&lt;ref name=CDC&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Michele C. | last1 = Black | first2 = Kathleen C. | last2 = Basile | first3 = Matthew J. | last3 = Breiding | first4 = Sharon G. | last4 = Smith | first5 = Mikel L. | last5 = Walters | first6 = Melissa T. | last6 = Merrick | first7 = 
Jieru | last7 = Chen | first8 = Mark R. | last8 = Stevens | name-list-format = vanc | title =The National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey (NISVS) | url = https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/NISVS_Executive_Summary-a.pdf | publisher = National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]: 48 | location = Atlanta, GA | date = 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; While research remains fragmentary, women in abusive relationships appear to be at higher risk of reproductive coercion and unintended pregnancies.&lt;ref name=Paterno&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Paterno MT, Jordan ET | title = A review of factors associated with unprotected sex among adult women in the United States | journal = Journal of Obstetric, Gynecologic, and Neonatal Nursing | volume = 41 | issue = 2 | pages = 258–74 | date = March 2012 | pmid = 22376055 | doi = 10.1111/j.1552-6909.2011.01334.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Center for Disease Control found that:&lt;ref name=CDC/&gt;
* approximately 8.6% (or an estimated 10.3 million) of women in the United States reported ever having an intimate partner who tried to get them pregnant when they did not want to, or refused to use a condom, with 4.8% having had an intimate partner who tried to get them pregnant when they did not want to, and 6.7% having had an intimate partner who refused to wear a condom;  
* approximately 10.4% (or an estimated 11.7 million) of men in the United States reported ever having an intimate partner who tried to get pregnant when they did not want to or tried to stop them from using birth control, with 8.7% having had an intimate partner who tried to get pregnant when they did not want to or tried to stop them from using birth control and 3.8% having had an intimate partner who refused to wear a condom.

==Assessment and intervention==
A typical assessment of women's reproductive health includes the following questions:&lt;ref name=FVPF&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Chamberlain | first1 = Linda | first2 = Rebecca | last2 = Levenson | name-list-format = vanc | url =  http://www.futureswithoutviolence.org/userfiles/file/HealthCare/Repro_Guide.pdf | title = Reproductive Health and Partner Violence Guidelines: An Integrated Response to Intimate Partner Violence and Reproductive Coercion | location = San Francisco | publisher = Family Violence Prevention Fund | date = 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Has a current or former partner not let you use birth control, destroyed your birth control, or refused to wear a condom?
* Has your partner ever tried to get you pregnant when you didn't want to be?
* Has your partner ever forced you to have an abortion or caused you to have a miscarriage?
* Has your partner ever purposely given you an STD?
* Are you worried you might be pregnant?&lt;ref name=FVPF /&gt;

Due to the findings related to reproductive coercion and its prevalence, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has called for its members to be vigilant for reproductive coercion.&lt;ref name=ACOG/&gt;   Clinical implications discovered through case studies are the following: to assess for reproductive coercion as a part of a routine family planning care; to assess reproductive coercion before discussing contraceptive options; to offer discreet birth control methods; and to assess safety.&lt;ref name=FVPF /&gt;  Some believe that all reproductive health care settings should have a written protocol for identifying and responding to domestic violence that includes reproductive coercion, and agencies that already have a protocol should be reviewed and expanded to address reproductive coercion.&lt;ref name=FVPF /&gt;

==Law==

In Mexico, the government permits [[abortion]], which is otherwise illegal, for women who have been coerced into pregnancy.&lt;ref name=CusackCI2011&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cusack | first1 = Carmen M. | name-list-format = vanc | year = 2011 | title = Consensual Insemination, An Analysis of Social Deviance within Gender, Family, or the Home | url = http://www.lsd-journal.net/archives/Volume2/Consensual%20Insemination.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Journal of Law &amp; Social Deviance | volume = 2 | issue = | page = 158 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sarkis Zabunyan''' ({{lang-hy|Սարգիս Զաբունյան}}), known as '''Sarkis''', ({{lang-hy|Սարգիս}}; born September 26, 1938 in [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]]) is a Turkish-born [[Armenians in Turkey|Armenian]] [[conceptual art]]ist living in [[France]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.ft.com/ftArticle?queryText=%22Sarkis+Zabunyan%22&amp;y=3&amp;aje=true&amp;x=19&amp;id=070407000764&amp;ct=0&amp;nclick_check=1 Margaret Kemp, ''Financial Times'', April 07, 2007.]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

Born in [[Istanbul]] in 1938, Sarkis studied French, painting and interior design before moving to [[Paris]] in 1964. In 1967, he won the painting prize at the [[Biennale de Paris]] and presented his work ''Connaissez-vous Joseph Beuys ?'' at the [[Salon de Mai]], in a reference to the man he considered the most important artist of the day. In 1969 he was invited by the critic and curator [[Harald Szeemann]] to take part in the now legendary show ''When Attitudes Become Form''. Teaching and the sharing of experience are key concerns of this artist. From 1980 to 1990 he was director of the Art Department at the École des Arts Décoratifs in Strasbourg, and from 1988 to 1995 he ran a seminar at the Institut des Hautes Etudes en Arts Plastiques created by [[Pontus Hulten]].
Since the 1980s, Sarkis has taken part in numerous international exhibitions (including [[Documenta]] and the biennials in Venice, Sydney, Istanbul and Moscow) and had his work shown in the world’s leading museums.

In the exhibition ''Passages'' at the [[Pompidou Centre]] in 2010, works by Sarkis were allowed to dialogue with works by [[Kasimir Malevich]], the wall from [[André Breton]]’s studio, and ''Plight'' by [[Joseph Beuys]], who is one of Sarkis’s sources of inspiration, along with the Russian filmmaker [[Andrei Tarkovsky]], one of whose films he explored in the [[Brancusi]] studio. ''Passages'' evoked both the permanent back-and-forth between an artist’s studio and the museum, and [[Walter Benjamin]]’s great unfinished work about the arcades of Paris. The exhibition featured a series of recent or specially created works produced by the Pompidou Centre. These works, standing as the artist’s ''KRIEGSSCHATZ'' (trophies), comprised found objects, art works and ethnographic objects from different civilizations.

In 2011 the Musée d’Art Moderne et Contemporain in Geneva (MAMCO) devoted an important retrospective to the artist entitled ''Hôtel Sarkis''. The presentation on four floors brought together 200 works created between 1971 and 2011, and explored the artist’s different practices (video and sound installations, watercolours, photographs, films) and thus amplified the resonance of a body of work produced in response to other artists, whether musicians, architects, writers, philosophers, painters, sculptors or filmmakers.

In 2012, Sarkis presented ''Ballads'' in the 5000 square metres of the underwater Hangars, at the invitation of the Museum Boijmans van Beuningen and the Port of Rotterdam, as well as ''Ailleurs, Ici'' on the estate of [[Chaumont-sur-Loire]], following a commission by the regional council of Centre. He has also taken part in the group show ''La Triennale – Intense Proximité'' at the [[Palais de Tokyo]] with his ''Frise des Trésors de Guerre'', showed at ''Néon, who’s afraid of red, yellow and blue?'' at La Maison Rouge – Fondation Antoine de Galbert, and Istanbul Modern at the [[Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen]].

In 2013, Sarkis took part in the exhibition ''When Attitudes Become Form, Bern 1969/Venice 2013'' at the Prada Foundation as part of the 55th [[Venice Biennale]]. He also showed at ''Passages Croisés en or'' at the Château d’Angers, and was invited to present his ''Frise de Guerre'' at the Museum of Old and New Art (MONA) in Tasmania as part of the exhibition ''The Red Queen''. Sarkis also participated in the exhibition ''Ici, Ailleurs'' as part of the Marseille – Provence, European Capital of Culture programme, and the exhibition ''Modernity? Perspectives from France and Turkey'' at the Istanbul Modern, and in his solo exhibition titled ''Sarkis – Cage/Ryoanji Interpretation'' at the ARTER – Space for Art in Istanbul. 
In 2014 he exhibited his ''Ring Portraits'' at the [[Huis Marseille|Huis Marseille Museum voor Fotografie]] in Amsterdam, and was presented in three places: the CIAC, the MNAC and the Museum of the Romanian Peasant in Bucharest. A solo exhibition devoted to his work appeared at the Musée du Château des Ducs de Wurtemberg in Montbéliard.

'''Siberian chiffchaff''' (''Phylloscopus (collybita) tristis'') is a [[leaf-warbler]] which is usually considered a subspecies of the [[common chiffchaff]], but may be a species in its own right.

==Range==

Siberian chiffchaff breeds in [[Siberia]] east of the [[Pechora River]] and winters in the lower [[Himalayas]].&lt;ref name= Baker&gt;{{cite book | last = Baker | first = Kevin | coauthors= |title = Warblers of Europe, Asia and North Africa ([[Helm Identification Guides]])  | year = 1997 | publisher = Helm| isbn =0-7136-3971-7 |pages = 256–259 | location = London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Status in Europe and North America===

It is also regularly recorded in western Europe in winter, and it is likely that the numbers involved have been underestimated due to uncertainties over identification criteria, lack of good data and recording policies ([[Sweden]] and [[Finland]] only accept trapped birds).&lt;ref name= dean8&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Dean | first1 = Alan | last2 = Bradshaw | first2 = Colin | last3 = Martin | first3 = John | last4 = Stoddart | first4 = Andy | last5 = Walbridge | first5 = Grahame | year = 2010 | title = The status in Britain of 'Siberian Chiffchaff' | url = | journal = British Birds  | volume = 103 | issue = | pages = 320–337 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of their unfamiliar appearance, British records in the 1950s and 1960s were originally thought to be [[greenish warbler]]s, and accepted as such by [[British Birds Rarities Committee|BBRC]], the national [[bird records committee|rarities committee]], until the records were reviewed in the 1980s.&lt;ref name=Greenish&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Dean | first1 = Alan | year = 1985 | title = Review of British status and identification of Greenish Warbler | url = | journal = British Birds  | volume = 78 | issue = 9 | pages = 437–451 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Gambell, Alaska|Gambell, AK]] bird discovered by Alexander Lin-Moore and Ethan Goodman on June 5, 2015 and seen by many birders would be the 4th (or 5th?) reported in North America.&lt;ref name=previous&gt;http://birdingfrontiers.com/2014/06/15/siberian-chiffchaffs-in-alaska/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearance and vocalisations==

It is a dull bird, grey or brownish above and whitish below, with little yellow in the plumage, and the buff-white supercilium is often longer than in the western subspecies. It has  a higher pitched ''suitsistsuisit'' song and a short high-pitched ''cheet'' call.&lt;ref name= chiffchaff&gt;{{cite book | last = Clement| first = Peter| coauthors= |title = The Chiffchaff| year = 1995 | publisher = Hamlyn| location = London|isbn = 0-600-57978-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes considered to be a full species due to its distinctive plumage and vocalisations, being similar to ''P. s. sindianus'' in these respects.&lt;ref name=Martens1982&gt;{{de icon}} Martens, Jochen (1982): Ringförmige Arealüberschneidung und Artbildung beim Zilpzalp, ''Phylloscopus collybita''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11133">A '''social bot''' (also: '''''socialbot''''' or '''''socbot''''') is a particular type of [[chatbot]] that is employed in [[social media]] networks to automatically generate messages (e.g. [[Twitter|tweets]]) or in general [[advocate]] certain ideas, support [[Advertising campaign|campaign]]s, and [[public relation]]s either by acting as a "[[Ghost followers|follower]]" or even as a fake account that gathers followers itself. In this respect, social bots can be said to have passed the [[Turing test]].&lt;ref name="techtarget"/&gt; 
&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/20/fashion/social-media-bots-offer-phony-friends-and-real-profit.html&lt;/ref&gt;
Social bots appear to have played a significant role in the [[United States presidential election, 2016]]&lt;ref&gt;Bessi, A &amp; Ferrara, E.

First Monday 21(11), 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |last=Shao |first=Chengcheng |author2=Giovanni Luca Ciampaglia |author3=Onur Varol |author4=Kaicheng Yang |author5=Alessandro Flammini |author6=Filippo Menczer |eprint=1707.07592 |title=The spread of low-credibility content by social bots |year=2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and their history appears to go back at least to the [[United States midterm elections, 2010]].&lt;ref name="astroturf"&gt;{{cite conference|last=Ratkiewicz |first=Jacob|author2=Michael Conover |author3=Mark Meiss |author4=Bruno Gonçalves |author5=Alessandro Flammini |author6=Filippo Menczer |title=Detecting and Tracking Political Abuse in Social Media |book-title=Proc. 5th International AAAI Conf. on Web and Social Media (ICWSM) |year=2011 |url= http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/ICWSM/ICWSM11/paper/view/2850}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that 9-15% of active Twitter accounts may be social bots&lt;ref name="bot_estimation" /&gt; and that 15% of the total Twitter population active in the US Presidential election discussion were bots. At least 400,000 thousand bots were responsible for about 3.8 million tweets, roughly 19% of the total volume.&lt;ref&gt;Bessi, A &amp; Ferrara, E. (2016) Social Bots Distort the 2016 US Presidential election online discussion. First Monday 21(11), 2016&lt;/ref&gt; All these claims are disputed.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

[[Twitterbot]]s are already well-known examples, but corresponding [[autonomous agent]]s on [[Facebook]] and elsewhere have also been observed. Nowadays, social bots can generate convincing [[internet persona]]s that are well capable of influencing real people,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[First Monday (journal)|First Monday]]|title=Social bots distort the 2016 U.S. Presidential election online discussion |author=Alessandro Bessi and Emilio Ferrara|date=2016-11-07|url=http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/7090/5653}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="techtarget"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/socialbot|publisher=whatis.techtarget.com|title=What is socialbot? - Definition from WhatIs.com|accessdate=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RiseOfSocialBots" /&gt; although they are not always reliable.&lt;ref&gt;[https://au.news.yahoo.com/a/36619546/china-kills-ai-chatbots-after-they-start-criticising-communism/#page1 China kills AI chatbots after they start praising US, criticising communists] Yahoo! News August 5, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Social bots, besides being able to produce messages autonomously, also share many traits with [[spambot]]s with respect to their tendency to infiltrate large user groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |last=Ferrara |first=Emilio |eprint=1708.08134 |title=Measuring social spam and the effect of bots on information diffusion in social media |year=2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using social bots is against the terms of service of many platforms, especially Twitter &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/twitter-automation|title=Automation rules|language=en|access-date=2018-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Instagram &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/about/legal/terms/before-january-19-2013/|title=Terms of Use • Instagram|website=www.instagram.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However many users, especially businesses still automate their Instagram activity in order to gain real followers rather than buying fake ones. This is commonly done through third-party social automation companies.

Unless strict regulations on their use are passed, socialbots are expected to play a major role in future shaping of [[public opinion]] by autonomously acting as incessant and never-tiring [[influencer marketing|influencers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How robots could shape Germany's political future|publisher=The Local|date=21 November 2016|url=http://www.thelocal.de/20161121/social-bots-robots-germany-elections-future|quote="Social Bots" were the sinister cyber friend in the US elections who didn't actually exist. Could they also shape how Germans vote next year? }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/the-rise-of-political-bots-on-social-media/a-19450562|title=The rise of political bots on social media |date= August 6, 2016|publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite web|publisher=BBC|title=How online 'chatbots' are already tricking you|quote=Intelligent machines that can pass for humans have long been dreamed of, but as Chris Baraniuk argues, they’re already among us.|url=http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20140609-how-online-bots-are-tricking-you|date=2014-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
Lutz Finger identifies 5 immediate uses for social bots:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=Feb 17, 2015|title=Do Evil - The Business Of Social Media Bots|author=Lutz Finger|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/lutzfinger/2015/02/17/do-evil-the-business-of-social-media-bots/#5ffe3e801104|publisher=forbes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*foster [[Notability|fame]]: having an arbitrary number of (unrevealed) bots as (fake) followers can help simulate real success
*[[spamming]]: having advertising bots in online chats is similar to email spam, but a lot more direct
*[[mischief]]: e.g. signing up an opponent with a lot of fake identities and spam the account or help others discover it to discreditize the opponent
*[[bias]] [[public opinion]]: influence [[Fad|trends]] by countless messages of similar content with different phrasings
*limit [[free speech]]: important messages can be pushed out of sight by a deluge of automated bot messages
The effects of all points can be likened to and support methods of traditional [[psychological warfare]].

==Detection==
The first generation of bots could sometimes be distinguished from real users by their often [[superhuman]] capacities to post messages around the clock (and at massive rates). Later developments have succeeded in imprinting more "human" activity and [[behavioural pattern]]s in the agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Romanov|first=Aleksei|author2=Alexander Semenov|author3=Oleksiy Mazhelis|author4=Jari Veijalainen|title=Detection of Fake Profiles in Social Media - Literature Review |journal=Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Web Information Systems and Technologies|date=2017|url=http://www.scitepress.org/DigitalLibrary/Link.aspx?doi=10.5220/0006362103630369}}&lt;/ref&gt; To unambiguously detect social bots as what they are, a variety of criteria must be applied together using [[pattern detection]] techniques, some of which are:&lt;ref name="RiseOfSocialBots"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ferrara |first1=Emilio |last2=Varol |first2=Onur |last3=Davis |first3=Clayton |last4=Menczer |first4=Filippo |last5=Flammini |first5=Alessandro |year=2016 |title=The Rise of Social Bots |journal=Communications of the ACM |volume=59 |issue=7 |pages=96–104 |doi=10.1145/2818717 |url=http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2016/7/204021-the-rise-of-social-bots/fulltext|arxiv=1407.5225 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The system leverages over a thousand features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last=Davis|first=Clayton A.|author2=Onur Varol|author3=Emilio Ferrara|author4=Alessandro Flammini|author5=Filippo Menczer|title= BotOrNot: A System to Evaluate Social Bots|book-title=Proc.

An active method that worked well in detecting early spam bots was to set up [[honeypot (computing)|honeypot]] accounts where obvious nonsensical content was posted and then dumbly reposted (retweeted) by bots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=technologyreview.com|title=How to Spot a Social Bot on Twitter|quote=Social bots are sending a significant amount of information through the Twittersphere.

That is explained by usage of "friend farm" services to collect large number of friends in a short period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Romanov|first=Aleksei|author2=Alexander Semenov|author3=Jari Veijalainen|title=Revealing Fake Profiles in Social Networks by Longitudinal Data Analysis |journal=Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Web Information Systems and Technologies|date=2017|url=http://www.scitepress.org/DigitalLibrary/Link.aspx?doi=10.5220%2f0006243900510058}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Soil conservation''' is the preventing of soil loss from [[erosion]] or reduced fertility caused by over usage, acidification, salinization or other chemical [[soil contamination]].

[[Slash-and-burn]] and other unsustainable methods of [[subsistence farming]] are practiced in some lesser developed areas. A sequel to the deforestation is typically large scale [[erosion]], loss of soil nutrients and sometimes total [[desertification]]. Techniques for improved soil conservation include [[crop rotation]], [[cover crop]]s, [[Tillage#Conservation tillage|conservation tillage]] and planted [[windbreak]]s and affect both erosion and fertility. When plants, especially trees, die, they decay and become part of the soil. Code 330 defines standard methods recommended by the U.S. [[Natural Resources Conservation Service]].
Farmers have practiced soil conservation for millennia. In Europe, policies such as the Common Agricultural Policy are targeting the application of best management practices such as reduced tillage, winter cover crops,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Panagos|first=Panos|last2=Borrelli|first2=Pasquale|last3=Meusburger|first3=Katrin|last4=Alewell|first4=Christine|last5=Lugato|first5=Emanuele|last6=Montanarella|first6=Luca|title=Estimating the soil erosion cover-management factor at the European scale|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0264837715001611|journal=Land Use Policy|volume=48|pages=38–50|doi=10.1016/j.landusepol.2015.05.021|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; plant residues and grass margins in order to better address the soil conservation.Political and economic action is further required to solve the erosion problem. A simple governance hurdle concerns how we name and value the land and what we call it and this can be changed by cultural adaptation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Panagos|first=Panos|last2=Imeson|first2=Anton|last3=Meusburger|first3=Katrin|last4=Borrelli|first4=Pasquale|last5=Poesen|first5=Jean|last6=Alewell|first6=Christine|date=2016-08-01|title=Soil Conservation in Europe: Wish or Reality?|journal=Land Degradation &amp; Development|language=en|volume=27|issue=6|pages=1547–1551|doi=10.1002/ldr.2538|issn=1099-145X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contour ploughing  ==
[[Contour ploughing]] orients furrows following the [[contour line]]s of the farmed area. Furrows move left and right to maintain a constant altitude, which reduces [[Surface runoff|runoff]]. Contour ploughing was practiced by the ancient [[Phoenicia]]ns, and is effective for slopes between two and ten percent.&lt;ref&gt;''Predicting soil erosion by water, a guide to conservation planning in the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation'', [[United States Department of Agriculture]], Agricultural Research Service, Agricultural handbook no. 703 (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; Contour plowing can increase crop yields from 10 to 50 percent, partially as a result of greater soil retention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/contourfarmingbo23unit|title=Contour farming boosts yields: a farmer's guide in laying out key contour lines and establishing grassed waterways|last=United States. Department of Agriculture|first=National Agricultural Library|date=1943-01-01|publisher=[Washington, D.C.] : U.S. Dept. of Agriculture}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==  Terrace Farming ==
[[terrace (agriculture)|Terracing]] is the practice of creating nearly level areas in a hillside area. The terraces form a series of steps, each at a higher level than the previous. Terraces are protected from erosion by other soil barriers.

Terraced farming is more common on small farms and in underdeveloped countries, since mechanized equipment is difficult to deploy in this setting.
It protects the soil from its erosion. It is one of the way by which soil erosion can be stopped. It is the step can be cut out on the slopes making terraces. It restricts soil erosion. It is practiced in western and central Himalayas

== Keyline design ==

[[Keyline design]] is an enhancement of contour farming, where the total watershed properties are taken into account in forming the [[contour line]]s.

== Perimeter runoff control ==
[[File:Runoff and filtersoxx.ogv|thumb|350px|runoff and filter soxx]]

Tree, [[shrub]]s and [[ground-cover]] are effective perimeter treatment for [[soil erosion]] prevention, by impeding surface flows. A special form of this perimeter or inter-row treatment is the use of a “grass way” that both [[Channel (geography)|channel]]s and dissipates runoff through surface friction, impeding [[surface runoff]] and encouraging infiltration of the slowed surface water.&lt;ref&gt;''Perimeter landscaping of Carneros Business Park'', Lumina Technologies, Santa Rosa, Ca., prepared for Sonoma County, Ca. (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Windbreaks==

Windbreaks are sufficiently dense rows of [[tree]]s at the [[Windward and leeward|windward]] exposure of an agricultural field subject to [[wind]] [[erosion]].&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Summer, ''Modelling Soil Erosion, Sediment Transport and Closely Related Hydrological Processes'' entry by Mingyuan Du, Peiming Du, Taichi Maki and Shigeto Kawashima, “Numerical modeling of air flow over complex terrain concerning wind erosion”, International Association of Hydrological Sciences publication no. 249 (1998)  {{ISBN|1-901502-50-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Evergreen]] [[species]] provide year-round protection; however, as long as [[foliage]] is present in the seasons of bare [[soil]] surfaces, the effect of [[deciduous]] trees may be adequate.

== Cover crops/crop rotation ==

Cover crops such as legumes plant, white turnip, radishes and other species are rotated with cash crops to blanket the soil year-round and act as [[green manure]] that replenishes nitrogen and other critical nutrients. Cover crops also help suppress weeds.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news

== Soil-conservation farming ==

Soil-conservation farming involves [[no-till farming]], “green manures” and other soil-enhancing practices.  Such farming methods attempt to mimic the biology of [[barren lands]]. They can revive damaged soil, minimize erosion, encourage plant growth, eliminate the use of nitrogen fertilizer or fungicide, produce above-average yields and protect crops during droughts or flooding. The result is less labor and lower costs that increase farmers’ profits. No-till farming and cover crops act as sinks for nitrogen and other nutrients. This increases the amount of [[soil organic matter]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Repeated plowing/tilling degrades soil, killing its beneficial fungi and earthworms. Once damaged, soil may take multiple seasons to fully recover, even in optimal circumstances.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Critics argue that no-till and related methods are impractical and too expensive for many growers, partly because it requires new equipment. They cite advantages for conventional tilling depending on the geography, crops and soil conditions. Some farmers claimed that no-till complicates weed control, delays planting and that post-harvest residues, especially for corn, are hard to manage.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Salinity management==
[[File:Aralship2.jpg|thumb|right|Salt deposits on the former bed of the [[Aral Sea]]]]

{{Main article|Soil salinity control}}
[[Salinity]] in soil is caused by irrigating with salty water. Water then evaporates from the soil leaving the salt behind. Salt breaks down the soil structure, causing infertility and reduced growth.
 
The [[ions]] responsible for salination are: [[sodium]] (Na&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:87%;"&gt;+)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, [[potassium]] (K&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:87%;"&gt;+)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, [[calcium]] (Ca&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:87%;"&gt;2+)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, [[magnesium]] (Mg&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:87%;"&gt;2+)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and [[chlorine]] (Cl&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:87%;"&gt;-)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Salinity is estimated to affect about one third of the earth’s [[arable land]].&lt;ref&gt;Dan Yaron, ''Salinity in Irrigation and Water Resources'', Marcel Dekker, New York (1981)   {{ISBN|0-8247-6741-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soil salinity adversely affects crop [[metabolism]] and erosion usually follows.

Salinity occurs on [[drylands]] from [[Irrigation|overirrigation]] and in areas with shallow saline water tables. Over-irrigation deposits salts in upper soil layers as a byproduct of soil [[infiltration (hydrology)|infiltration]]; irrigation merely increases the rate of salt deposition. The best-known case of shallow [[saline water]] table [[capillary action]] occurred in [[Egypt]] after the 1970 construction of the [[Aswan Dam]]. The change in the [[groundwater]] level led to high salt concentrations in the water table. The continuous high level of the [[water table]] led to [[soil salination]].

Use of [[humic acid]]s may prevent excess salination, especially given excessive irrigation. Humic acids can fix both [[anion]]s and [[cation]]s and eliminate them from [[root|root zones]]. Planting species that can tolerate saline conditions to produce surface cover can preserve soil salinity can be reduced. Salt-tolerant plants include [[saltbush]], a plant found in much of [[North America]] and in the [[Mediterranean]] regions of [[Europe]].

Pagal Organisms In Soil
[[File:K 1033CR08-9 Yellow fungus on stalk.jpeg|thumb|200px|right|Yellow fungus, a [[mushroom]] that assists in organic decay.]]

When worms excrete [[faeces|egesta]] in the form of [[Vermicompost|casts]], a balanced selection of minerals and plant nutrients is made into a form accessible for [[root]] uptake. [[Earthworm]] casts are five times richer in available [[nitrogen]], seven times richer in available [[phosphate]]s and eleven times richer in available [[potash]] than the surrounding upper {{Convert|150|mm}} of soil. The weight of casts produced may be greater than 4.5&amp;nbsp;kg per worm per year. By burrowing, the earthworm improves soil [[poros]]ity, creating channels that enhance the processes of aeration and drainage.&lt;ref&gt;Bill  Mollison, ''Permaculture: A Designer's Manual'', Tagari Press, (December 1, 1988), 576 pages, {{ISBN|0908228015}}. Increases in porosity enhance infiltration and thus reduce adverse effects of [[surface runoff]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Other important soil organisms include [[nematodes]], [[Mycorrhiza|mycorrizha]] and [[bacteria]].

Degraded soil requires [[synthetic fertilizer]] to produce high yields. Lacking structure increases erosion and carries nitrogen and other pollutants into rivers and streams.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Each one percent increase in soil organic matter helps soil hold '''20,000''' gallons more water per acre.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Mineralization==
To allow plants full realization of their [[phytonutrient]] potential, active [[mineralization (biology)|mineralization]] of the soil is sometimes undertaken. This can involve adding crushed rock or chemical soil supplements. In either case the purpose is to [[combat]] [[mineral]] depletion. A broad range of minerals can be used, including common substances such  as [[phosphorus]] and more exotic substances such as [[zinc]] and [[selenium]]. Extensive research examines the phase transitions of minerals in soil with aqueous contact.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur T. Hubbard, ''Encyclopedia of Surface and Colloid Science Vol 3'', Santa Barbara, California Science Project, Marcel Dekker, New York (2004) {{ISBN|0-8247-0759-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flooding can bring significant [[sediments]] to an [[alluvial]] plain. While this effect may not be desirable if floods endanger life or if the sediment originates from productive land, this process of addition to a [[floodplain]] is a natural process that can rejuvenate soil chemistry through mineralization.

'''Sound art''' is an artistic discipline in which [[sound]] is utilised as a primary [[artistic medium|medium]]. Like many genres of [[contemporary art]], sound art may be [[interdisciplinary]] in nature, or be used in [[Cross-genre|hybrid]] forms. Sound art can be considered as being an element of many areas such as [[acoustics]], [[psychoacoustics]], [[electronics]], [[noise music]], audio [[Recording medium|media]], [[Field recording|found or environmental sound]], soundscapes, explorations of the human body, [[sculpture]], [[architecture]], [[film]] or [[video]] and other aspects of the current discourse of contemporary art.&lt;ref&gt;Kahn. 2001, {{Page needed|date=May 2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Western art]], early examples include [[Luigi Russolo]]'s ''[[Intonarumori]]'' or noise intoners, and subsequent experiments by [[Dadaists]], [[Surrealists]], the [[Situationist International]], and in [[Fluxus]] [[happenings]]. Because of the diversity of sound art, there is often debate about whether sound art falls within the domains of [[visual art]] or [[experimental music]] categories, or both.&lt;ref&gt;Licht 2007, {{Page needed|date=May 2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Other artistic lineages from which sound art emerges are [[conceptual art]], [[minimalism]], [[site-specific art]], [[sound poetry]], [[electro-acoustic music]], [[spoken word]], [[avant-garde]] poetry, and [[experimental theatre]].

==Origin of the term in the United States==
The earliest documented use of the term in the U.S. is from a catalogue for a show called "Sound/Art" at The Sculpture Center in New York City, created by William Hellerman in 1983.  The show was sponsored by "The SoundArt Foundation," which Hellerman founded in 1982.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} The artists featured in the show were: [[Vito Acconci]], Connie Beckley, Bill and Mary Buchen, [[Nicolas Collins]], [[Sari Dienes]] and [[Pauline Oliveros]], Richard Dunlap, [[Terry Fox (artist)|Terry Fox]], William Hellermann, Jim Hobart, [[Richard Lerman]], [[Les Levine]], [[Joe Lewis (artist)|Joe Lewis]], Tom Marioni, [[Jim Pomeroy (artist)|Jim Pomeroy]], Alan Scarritt, [[Carolee Schneeman]], Bonnie Sherk, [[Keith Sonnier]], Norman Tuck, [[Hannah Wilke]], Yom Gagatzi. The following is an excerpt from the catalogue essay by art historian Don Goddard: "It may be that sound art adheres to curator Hellermann's perception that "hearing is another form of seeing,' that sound has meaning only when its connection with an image is understood... The conjunction of sound and image insists on the engagement of the viewer, forcing participation in real space and concrete, responsive thought rather than illusionary space and thought."&lt;ref&gt;Hellerman and Goddard 1983, {{Page needed|date=May 2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Sound art always takes place in an acoustic context, which may influence interpretation as much as if not more than any associated imagery. Installations of sound art rely on the acoustics of the spaces and reproduction technologies employed as can be exemplified by current practitioners such as Chris Watson.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

==Sound art in Europe==
===Belgium===
The [[Klankenbos]] (Sound forest) of [[Provinciaal Domein Dommelhof]] is the biggest sound art collection in [[public space]] in Europe. In the forest there are 15 [[sound installation]] pieces by artists such as [[Pierre Berthet]], [[Paul Panhuysen]], [[Geert Jan Hobbijn]] ([[Staalplaat]] Soundsystem), [[Hans van Koolwijk]], and others. Yearly in [[Kortrijk]] there is the sound art festival [[Wilde Westen]] (formerly known as Happy New Ears). In [[Brussels]] there are [[QO2]] and [[Overtoon]], two organisations that run [[artist-in-residence]] programs and organize events. [[Logos Foundation]] from [[Ghent]] is a sound art org run by [[Godfried-Willem Raes]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

===Croatia===
In [[Zadar]] there is the [[Sea Organ]] which plays music by way of sea waves and tubes located underneath a set of large marble steps.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

===Germany===
Originally from Amsterdam, but moved to Berlin is [[Staalplaat]], a record label focused on sound art and [[experimental music]]. [[Transmediale]] is a yearly festival focused on [[media art]], covering many sound art performances and installations.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

===The Netherlands===
The Dutch sound art tradition started more or less in the [[Philips Natuurkundig Laboratorium]] where [[Dick Raaijmakers]] worked in the 60s. [[Paul Panhuysen]] and [[Remko Scha]] developed many early sound art pieces in the 70s and 80s and set up the [[Apollohuis]] in [[Eindhoven]]. [[STEIM]]. [[WORM (Rotterdam)|WORM]], [[Extrapool]] are active organisations that have sound art activities. [[Polderlicht]] was a sound art festival running from 2000–2015. [[iii]] (Instrument Inventors innitiative]] is a [[The Hague]] based organisation focused on the creation of sound art pieces. The organisation has an active [[artist-in-residence]] program and continuously invites sound artists to make new works at their location. The Netherlands have three academies where you can study in the direction of sound art [[Institute of Sonology]], [[Art Science]] at [[Royal Academy of Art, The Hague]] and at the [[Utrecht School of the Arts]] in Utrecht.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

===Norway===
[[Lydgalleriet]] (The Soundgallery) is a non-commercial gallery for sound based art practices, situated in the centre of Bergen.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

===Sweden===
[[Playing the Building]] was an art installation by [[David Byrne]], ex singer of [[Talking Heads]], and [[Färgfabriken]], an independent art venue in [[Stockholm]]. [[Elektronmusikstudion]] is an active organisation.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

===United Kingdom===
A known sound art pieces in the UK are [[Blackpool High Tide Organ]] and  [[Singing Ringing Tree (Panopticons)|Singing Ringing Tree]]. Although not build as sound art pieces, the UK has several [[acoustic mirror]]s along the coastline often explored by [[field recording|field recorders]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

[[File:Inquilinos.gif|thumb|upright|Social status is often associated with clothing and possessions. Compare the foreman with a horse and high hat with the [[inquilino]] in picture. Image from 19th century rural [[Chile]]]]

As people aspire to high status, they often seek also its symbols.  As with other [[symbol]]s, status symbols may change in value or meaning over time, and will differ among countries and cultural regions, based on their economy and technology.

For example, before the invention of the [[printing press]], possession of a large collection of laboriously hand-copied [[book]]s was a symbol of wealth and scholarship. In later centuries, books (and literacy) became more common, so a [[private library]] became less-rarefied as a status symbol, though a sizable collection still commands respect.

In some past cultures of East Asia, [[pearl]]s and [[jade]] were major status symbols, reserved exclusively for royalty. Similar legal exclusions applied to the [[toga]] and its variants in [[ancient Rome]], and to [[cotton]] in the [[Aztec Empire]].  Special colors, such as [[Imperial yellow jacket|imperial yellow]] (in China) or [[royal purple]] (in ancient Rome) were reserved for royalty, with severe penalties for unauthorized display. Another common status symbol of the European medieval past was [[heraldry]], a display of one's family name and history.

==Societal recognition==
Status symbols also indicate the cultural values of a society or a subculture. For example, in a [[commerce|commercial]] society, having money or wealth and things that can be bought by wealth, such as cars, houses, or fine clothing, are considered status symbols. Where warriors are respected, a [[scar]] can represent honor or courage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.missedinhistory.com/blogs/real-men-have-dueling-scars.htm|title=Real Men Have Dueling Scars|date=2009-05-04|work=Stuff You Missed in History Class|access-date=2017-12-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among [[intellectual]]s being able to think in an intelligent and educated way is an important status symbol regardless of material possessions.  In academic circles, a long list of publications and a securely [[tenure]]d position at a prestigious university or research institute are a mark of high status. It has been speculated that the earliest foods to be domesticated were luxury feast foods used to cement one's place as a "rich person".&lt;ref&gt;Hayden B 2003. Were luxury foods the first domesticates? Ethnoarchaeological perspectives from Southeast Asia. World Archaeology 34(3)&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[uniform]] symbolizes membership in an organization, and may display additional insignia of rank, specialty, tenure and other details of the wearer's status within the organization. A state may confer [[award|decoration]]s, medals or [[badge]]s  that can show that the wearer has heroic or official status. Elaborate [[color-coded]] [[academic regalia]] is often worn during [[Graduation|commencement]] ceremonies, indicating [[academic rank]] and specialty.

In many cultures around the world, diverse [[visual markers of marital status]] are widely used. [[Coming of age]] rituals and other [[rites of passage]] may involve granting and display of symbols of a new status. [[Dress code]]s may specify who ought to wear particular kinds or styles of clothing, and when and where specific items of clothing are displayed.

== Body modifications ==
{{sources|section|date=November 2017}}
The condition and appearance of one's body can be a status symbol. In times past, when most workers did physical labor outdoors under the sun and often had little food, being pale and fat was a status symbol, indicating wealth and prosperity (through having more than enough food and not having to do manual labor). Now that workers usually do less-physical work indoors and find little time for exercise, being tanned and thin is often a status symbol in modern cultures.

[[Dieting]] to reduce excess body fat is widely practiced in Western society, while some traditional societies still value [[obesity]] as a sign of prosperity.  Development of [[muscle]]s through [[exercise]], previously disdained as a stigma of doing heavy [[manual labor]], is now valued as a sign of personal achievement.  Some groups, such as extreme [[bodybuilder]]s and [[sumo wrestler]]s use special exercise and diet to "bulk up" into an impressive appearance.

== Material possessions ==

[[Luxury goods]] are often perceived as status symbols.  Examples may include a [[mansion]] or [[penthouse apartment|penthouse]] apartment,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Winter |first=Ian C. |title=The Radical Home Owner |year=1995 |isbn=2-88449-028-0 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[trophy spouse]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Classism and Feminist Therapy: Counting Costs |last=Hill |first=Marcia |author2=Esther D.

Status symbols are also used by persons of much more modest means. In the [[Soviet Union]] before the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]], possession of American-style [[jeans|blue jeans]] or [[rock music]] recordings (even pirated or bootlegged copies) was an important status symbol among rebellious [[teenagers]]. In the 1990s, foreign [[cigarette]]s in [[People's Republic of China|China]], where a pack of [[Marlboro (cigarette)|Marlboro]] could cost one day's salary for some workers, were seen as a status symbol.&lt;ref&gt;J Brooks.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23523">A '''Student Bill of Rights''' or Charter of Student Rights and Freedoms is a document adopted by a student group, university or college or government at a local, state or national level. It outlines a population's basic beliefs regarding student rights. These statements of belief are often the foundation for future legislative efforts or collaborative efforts to create joint statements between organizations. The [[European Student Union]], for example, uses their Student Rights Charter when lobbying for student rights in the European Union Higher Education Area as a document representing the student will.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esu-online.org/news/article/6064/97/ European Student Union] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926185642/http://www.esu-online.org/news/article/6064/97/ |date=2012-09-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The historic [[National Student Association]] in the United States used their Student Bill of Rights to help create dialogue between the [[American Association of University Professors]] and to initiate the creation of a joint statement on student rights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaup.org/aaup/pubsres/policydocs/contents/stud-rights.htm American Association of University Professors]&lt;/ref&gt; This collaborative effort gave credence to the demands of students and helped normalize student rights on campuses across North America. While the [[United States Student Association]] does not have a student bill of rights of its own, it upholds the 1947 student bill of rights put forth by the National Student Association.&lt;ref&gt;United States Student Association http://www.usstudents.org/about/history/&lt;/ref&gt;

These documents tend to do several things. They can be statements of belief, policy or law. When put forth by a student organization or third party organization they tend to be statements of belief because these organizations do not often have the ability to enforce their beliefs. Even though they are not legally binding they are important because they help policy and lawmakers understand what students expect and believe to be ethical treatment. At the institutional level they tend to be policy statements. These are legally binding as a promise from the institution to the students who attend and have been found in court to be considered to be part of the educational contract.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan and Lee (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

At any level these documents provide students with an understanding of their civil or legal rights which are already contained in legislation. These include rights pertinent to all citizens and also to students in the educational setting and provide procedural rights to inform students how institutions should be respecting their legal rights. When used as a statement of belief, however, they often include rights an organization feels students should have and the procedural rights institutions must follow to ensure these rights are fulfilled. There are currently a number of student petitions calling for the creation of national student bills in various countries. While there have been some attempts to create subject specific student bills in the United States, like the Academic Bill of Rights, these have not been successful due primarily for demand for a document which is wider in scope and deals with students constitutional, civil, contractual and consumer rights.

==North American Student Bills==
No country in North America has yet adopted a National Student Bill of Rights, Charter of Rights and Freedoms or Code of Rights and Responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;Occupy Education http://www.facebook.com/occupycollege&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;navigatehighered.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States of America===

====American National Student Bills====
In the United States there have been several national student bill of rights drafted by student organizations including the historic National Student Association and the American Association of University Professors and other non-governmantal organizations but as yet none have been legally institutionalized.

====National Student Association (NSA)====
In 1947 the National Student Association NSA in the United States adopted a student bill of rights. The text of this document is not easily accessible.  In 1967, however, the NSA put forth a joint statement on the rights and freedoms of students with the American Association of University Professors AAUP (now the Association of American Colleges and Universities). This statement was endorsed by a number of professional organizations. This document included the following rights:

Constitutional Rights
# Exercise of rights of citizenship
# Freedom of association
# Right to due process
Speech and Association Rights
# Student participation in institutional government
# Student publications
Due Process Rights
# Standards for investigation of student conduct
## Investigation of student conduct
## Hearings for student conduct
Classroom Rights
# Protection of freedom of inquiry and expression
# Protection from improper academic evaluation
# Protection from improper student information disclosure&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aaup.org/aaup/pubsres/policydocs/contents/stud-rights.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States Student Association====
The United States Student Association does not have an official student bill of rights. The USSA was formed when the historic NSA merged with the National Student Lobby NSL in 1978. They did not officially adopt the student bill of rights put forth in 1947. They text of this document is not on their website and cannot easily be found with a search of the internet.

====2003 Academic Bill of Rights====
In 2003, Georgia Congressman Kingston proposed the first national student bill of rights, House Bill #318. This bill, which was rejected in congress, was not an all encompassing student bill of rights but was narrowly defined to address academic freedom. Nevertheless, it was the first attempt at the creation of national legislation. The congressman found that "at almost every American university, conservative professors are drastically outnumbered." This bill was intended to secure the intellectual freedom of students and faculty. It did not address whether teachers would have the freedom to determine all course goals, curriculum, assignments, grading schemes and course timeline. These issues are of major importance because students in Europe are calling for rights which protect students from teachers having complete academic freedom in the classroom and which regulate them to ensure students have minimum educational quality standards.&lt;ref name="navigatehighered.weebly"&gt;http://navigatehighered.weebly.com/uploads/1/2/7/5/12753485/student_code_-_still_editing2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===American Institutional Student Bills===
In the United States individual institutions often have their own Student Bill of Rights, Charter of Rights and Freedoms or Code of Rights and Responsibilities. In elementary and secondary education these codes are often drafted by school board officials with perhaps the input of parent or parent teacher associations. In post secondary institutions these are often drafted by the academic senate with the contribution of student representatives. This process often includes varying degrees of student input from student surveys to no student voice and the academic senate may have as much as 50% student representation or as little as 0% student representation depending on the structure of the institution.

===Canada===

====Canadian Federation of Students====
The [[Canadian Federation of Students]] has yet to accept a student bill or rights, code of rights and responsibilities or a charter of rights and freedoms. The Canadian Encyclopedia, which details issues of Canadian life and governance, however, states that in Canada  "Basically 2 sorts of rights apply to students: substantive rights - the actual rights that students should enjoy - and procedural rights - methods by which students claim their rights. This article is concerned with students in public institutions, although those in private schools can claim rights under the common law and provincial education Acts."

====Declaration on the Canadian Student====
In the 1960s, the [[Canadian Union of Students]] had adopted the Declaration on the Canadian Student, a declaration aimed defining the rights and role of a student. The Declaration was adopted at the September 1965 annual meeting of the CUS, and was initiated mainly by the [[Student Federation of the University of Ottawa|Students' Union of the University of Ottawa]] President [[Jock Turcot]].&lt;ref&gt;La Rotonde. L’AGÉUO définit l’étudiant canadien. Published 22 September 1965&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, the CUS re-affirmed the "fundamental philosophy" behind the Declaration.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.studentunion.ca/2013/07/the-declaration-of-the-canadian-student/&lt;/ref&gt;

==European Student Bills==

===European Student Union===
In 2008 the European Student Union adopted a Student Rights Charter &lt;ref name="esu-online"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esu-online.org/news/article/6064/97/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926185642/http://www.esu-online.org/news/article/6064/97/ |archivedate=2012-09-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is in essence their platform. This document includes those rights and freedoms which members of the European student Union are lobbying for in their own countries. Romania currently has the strongest student rights legislation in the European Union and this is in part to do with the efforts of the European Student Union to press for legislation.&lt;ref name="esu-online" /&gt; The 2008 ESU Student Rights Charter includes the following rights:

===European National Country Level Student Bills===

====Germany====

====Romania====
Romania is the country which has the greatest student rights legislation currently in place. In 2010 the National Alliance of student organizations in Romania, which is also part of the European Student Union, and the Romanian Students' Union(USR) worked with the Romanian National Government to bring into law the Romanian National Student Code of Rights and Responsibilities.

A '''terminal countdown demonstration test''' ('''TCDT''') is a simulation of the final hours of a [[launch countdown]] and serves as a practice exercise in which both the launch team and flight crew rehearse launch day timelines and procedures. In the specific case of a TCDT for the [[Space Shuttle]], the test culminated in a simulated ignition and [[RSLS Abort]] (automated shutdown of the orbiter's main engines). Following the simulated abort, the flight crew was briefed on emergency egress procedures and use of the fixed service structure slidewire system.&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite web| url = http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/technology/sts-newsref/sts-lcc.html#sts-tcd | title = NSTS 1988 News Reference Manual | publisher = [[NASA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On some earlier shuttle missions, and Apollo missions, the test would conclude with the flight crew evacuating the launch pad by use of these emergency systems, however this is no longer part of the test.

Unmanned [[carrier rocket]] launches also undergo TCDTs, when countdown procedures are followed. These vary for specific rockets, for example [[solid rocket|solid-fuelled]] rockets would not simulate an engine shutdown, as it is impossible to shut down a solid rocket after it has been lit.

TCDTs typically are carried out a few days before launch.

'''Tyāga''' ([[Sanskrit]]:  [[wikt:त्याग#Sanskrit|त्याग]]) is a [[Sanskrit]] word that means "sacrifice, giving up in generosity, forsaking, resigning" anything of value,&lt;ref&gt;Monier Monier-Williams, [http://www.ibiblio.org/sripedia/ebooks/mw/0400/mw__0489.html Tyaga], Sanskrit English Dictionary, Oxford University Press, page 456&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Practical Sanskrit-English Dictionary|author=V.S.Apte|publisher=Digital Dictionaries of South Asia|url=http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/search3advanced?dbname=apte&amp;query=tyaga&amp;matchtype=exact&amp;display=utf8}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as "renunciation" depending on the context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kapil N.

==Etymology==
Tyāga means&amp;nbsp;– sacrifice, renunciation, abandonment, resignation, donation, forsaking, liberality, withdrawal &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sanskrit Dictionary|publisher=Spokensanskrit.de|url=http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=tyAga&amp;direction=SE&amp;link=yes&amp;choice=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tyāga which is not merely physical renunciation of the world is different from [[Sannyasa]]; Sannyasa which comes from the root as means&amp;nbsp;– "giving up entirely", Tyāga means&amp;nbsp;– "giving up with generosity what one could probably have kept".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Bhagavad Gita: A text and Commentary for Students|author=Jeaneane D.Fowler|publisher=Sussex Academy Press|page=273|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=zU4E5ZidVr0C&amp;pg=PA276&amp;dq=tyaga&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=baYAU8qbE8aAhAeavoCgBw&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=tyaga&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hinduism==

Tyāga or abandonment refers to giving up of all anxieties for enjoying the fruits of actions; through practice of this kind of ''tyāga'' infusing [[discipline]] in daily activities the momentary anxiety to enjoy fruits of actions is overcome. It is a [[Subjectivity|subjective]] renunciation of selfishness and desire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Managerial Ethics: Dilemmas in Decision Making|author=Poonam Sharma|publisher=SAGE|page=106|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lsWIy-T-0B4C&amp;pg=PA106&amp;dq=tyaga&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=baYAU8qbE8aAhAeavoCgBw&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=tyaga&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Yajna is Tyāga ''. The [[Vedic]] interpretation of renunciation (''tyāga '') of the fruits of ritual acts including&amp;nbsp;– ''agnistomena svargakāmo yajeta''&amp;nbsp;– "the desire for heaven", which renunciation is to be found expressed in the phrase&amp;nbsp;– ''agnaye idam na mama''&amp;nbsp;– "this is for Agni, not for me"&amp;nbsp;– pronounced by the yajamana at the time of the oblation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rituals and Mantras: Rules without meanings|author=Frits Staal|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=121|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=CKLxjjXqAsQC&amp;pg=PA179&amp;dq=tyaga+rig+veda&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=DqkBU47VEtGI7Ab7soCYAw&amp;ved=0CFQQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=tyaga%20rig%20veda&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Tejobindu Upanishad]] belonging to Krishna- yajurveda explains that in  ''Tyāga'' ('renunciation') one abandons the manifestations or objects of the universe through the cognition of [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] that is  ''Sat'' and  ''Cit'' and this is practiced by the wise as the giver of immediate salvation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Thirty Minor Upanishads|author=IslamKatob|publisher=Islamic Books|page=79|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=CvXZ0j1UyAAC&amp;pg=PA79&amp;dq=tyaga+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=A7ABU-3yH4aO7Aa51YDQAg&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=tyaga%20upanishads&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Kaivalya Upanishad portrays the state of man on the way of renunciation (''tyāga'') as having become free of all attachment to the worldly and who, consequently knows and feels himself only as the one divine essence that lives in all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Sixty Upanishads of the Veda|author=Paul Deussen|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=791|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=XYepeIGUY0gC&amp;pg=PA975&amp;dq=tyaga+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=drUBU7SdK4TChAeiuoGoBw&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=tyaga%20upanishads&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tyaga of Bhagavad Gita===

[[Moksha]] consists in securing lasting freedom from the bondage of existence in the form of birth and death and realizing God who is no other than Bliss (Brahman). Chapter VIII of the [[Bhagavad Gita]] deals with [[Sannyasa]] and Tyāga, the Paths of Knowledge and Action that are means to the attainment of moksha. [[Krishna]] tells [[Arjuna]] that even though ''sannyāsa'' is understood as the giving up of all actions motivated by desires, and ''tyāga'' consists in relinquishing the fruit of all actions; that all actions are worth giving up because they contain a measure of evil that acts of sacrifice, charity and penance are not worth shunning, there are three kinds of ''Tyāga''&amp;nbsp;– ''Sattvika'', ''Rajasika'' and ''Tamasika'' (Sloka XVIII.4). Whereas acts of sacrifice, charity and penance, the purifiers of wise men, must be performed without attachment and hope of award, Krishna states - मोहात्तस्य परित्यागस्तामसः (the abandonment of prescribed duty through ignorance) is not advisable, it is the ''Tamasika'' form of  ''tyāga''; if it is owing to कायक्लेशभयात्तयजेत् (abandonment for fear of physical strain) then it is  ''Rajasika'' form; if it is&amp;nbsp;–

:कार्यमित्येव यत्कर्म नियतं क्रियतेऽर्जुन |
:सङंग त्यक्त्वा फलं चैव स त्यागः सात्त्विको मतः| (Sloka XVIII.9)

: "A prescribed duty which is performed simply because it has to be performed, giving up attachment and fruit, that alone has been recognized as the Sattvika form of renunciation. "

Thereafter, Arjuna is told about the marks of a Sattvika-man of renunciation and that since all actions cannot be given up in their entirety by anyone possessing a body, he alone, who abstains from prohibited actions and those that are motivated by desire and performs duties, renounces the fruit of actions is called a man of renunciation; no fruits of actions accrues for him (Sloka XVIII.11-12).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Srimadbhagavadgita Tattvavivecani|author=Jayadayal Goyandaka|publisher=Gita Press, Gorakhpur|pages=659–669|url= http://www.exoticindiaart.com/book/details/srimad-bhagavad-gita-tattvavivecani-english-commentary-IDE961/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the preceding discourses, Krishna had recommended to Arjuna actions which ought to be performed as duty (Ch.III.19); He told him to perform ordained actions (Ch.III.8), to be free from attachment (Ch.III.9,19 &amp; Ch.II.48), and to have no desire for the fruit of action (Ch.II.47); Krishna had recommended  ''Sattvika-tyāga''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Philosophy of the Bhagavad Gita: An Exposition|author=Chhaganlal G. Kaji|publisher=Genesis Publishing|page=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uwUiusoi0qQC&amp;pg=PA558&amp;dq=tyaga&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=baYAU8qbE8aAhAeavoCgBw&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=tyaga&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sannyasa and Tyāga===

[[Sannyasa]] literally means&amp;nbsp;– throwing away, absolute rejection, formal monastic life; in the [[Bhagavad Gita]], it means&amp;nbsp;– mental state of thorough-going renunciation, of uncompromising abandonment of all that is unfit and unworthy, of intense dispassion toward things of the world, both internal and external. Tyāga literally means&amp;nbsp;– abandonment, the turning from all that hinders the realization of the Self; in the [[Bhagavad Gita]], it means&amp;nbsp;– renunciation in the sense of relinquishment of the fruit of action. Sannyāsa is external, even though it is based on internal disposition; Tyāga is completely mental, it is a state of thought and attitude. Arjuna is emphatically told that it is possible to act and accrue no karma whatsoever; it is a matter of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bhagavad Gita: Commentary Full|author=IslamKotob|publisher=Islamic Books|page=248,250|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b387bE4Ok0oC&amp;pg=PA248&amp;dq=tyaga&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=f5gBU4WbLuev7QahtoC4CQ&amp;ved=0CFMQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=tyaga&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this context, [[Chinmayananda]] remarks that abandonment is the true content of the status of renunciation&amp;nbsp;– ''sannyāsa'' without the  ''tyāga'' spirit is but an empty show; real abandonment is meant for rising to a nobler status of fulfilment, leading on to the ampler fields of expression, to fuller ways of living and to greater experiences of joy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Holy Geeta|author=Swami Chinmayananda|publisher=Chinmaya Mission|page=1127,1138|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eVw_Rff7m7AC&amp;pg=PA1138&amp;dq=tyaga&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=f5gBU4WbLuev7QahtoC4CQ&amp;ved=0CFgQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=tyaga&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; And, [[Sri Aurobindo|Aurobindo]] explains that&amp;nbsp;– "Sannysa in the standing of the terminology of the sages means the laying aside of desirable actions. In that sense Tyāga, not Sannyasa, is the better way. It is not the desirable actions that must be laid aside, but the desire that gives them that character has to be put away from us... The spiritual transference of all works to the Master and his Shakti is the real sannyāsa in the teachings of the Gita.... The essence of renunciation, the true Tyāga, the true sannyāsa is not any rule of thumb of inaction but a disinterested soul, a selfless mind, the transition from ego to the free impersonal and spiritual nature. "&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bhagavad Gita and its Message|author=Aurobindo|publisher=Lotus Press|pages=252–256|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=QnSE5zrNjVUC&amp;pg=PA252&amp;dq=tyaga&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=caEBU5KDGqvA7AaTroHoDw&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=tyaga&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Self-control|Self-discipline]] too becomes a form of  ''Sattvika-tyāga'', during the course of which exercise one has control over negative emotions and behaviours such as anger, greed and pride.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bhagavad Gita on Effective Leadership|author=Pujan Roka|publisher=iUniverse|page=139|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PWw-tGKmEYgC&amp;pg=PA139&amp;dq=tyaga&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=baYAU8qbE8aAhAeavoCgBw&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=tyaga&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Bhagavad Gita]] projects action to serve as steps on the path of spiritual ascent, as an effective means to purify the mind through diligently cultivated mental discipline in action; the true fruit of Tyāga is an elevating sense of peace and fulfillment, even if it entails a bit of physical discomfort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Art of Making Man Part 2|author=Chinmayananda|publisher=Chinmaya Mission|page=339|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CSiiLlXehVUC&amp;pg=PA339&amp;dq=tyaga&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9KcAU5yVBs-ihgf9woCYDA&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=tyaga&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jainism==

According to [[Tattvartha Sutra]], an ascetic’s [[dharma]] consists of ten elements i.e. abstract virtues, which are&amp;nbsp;– ''ksama'' ('forebearance'), ''[[mardava]]'' ('humility'), ''arjava'' ('uprightness'), ''sauca'' ('desirelessness'), ''satya'' ('truthfulness'), ''samyama'' ('self-discipline'), ''tapas'' ('self-mortification'), ''tyaga'' ('renunciation'), ''akincanya'' ('poverty') and  ''brahmacharya'' ('celibacy'). [[Hemachandra]] has recognized only two of the ten ''pratyakhyanas'' viz. ''sanketa-pratyakhyana'' and  ''addha-pratyakhyana'', the former, which is of eight types, is symbolic and the devotee refrains from taking food for some time by which renunciation he recalls his mind to his religious duties; the latter, is ritualistic, also connected with abstention from or renouncing food, and has a set methodology to adopt. [[Ahimsa in Jainism|Ahimsa-vrata]] practiced by the  ''Svetambras'' refers to the renunciation of killing. Basically, there are five kinds of  ''tyāgas'' included in the eleven pratimās viz. ''sacitta-tyāga pratimā'', the stage of renouncing uncooked food; ''ārambha-tyāga pratimā'', the stage of abandonment of all professional activity; ''parigraha-tyāga pratimā'', the stage of transferring publicly one’s property to a son or relative; ''anumati-tyāga pratimā'', the stage of leaving the household and refraining from counselling in household matters, and  ''uddista-tyāga pratimā'', the stage of not eating food especially prepared for oneself i.e. the stage of seeking alms like a monk, commonly followed by  '' [[Śvētāmbara|Svetambras]] '', '' [[Digambara]]s '' and  ''Avasyaka-Curni''. [[Nemicandra]] gives a list of eighty-four asatanas which includes  ''sacittanām atayāga'' or failure to remove sentient objects and  ''ajive tyāga'' or failure to remove non-sentient objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Jaina Yoga: A Survey of the Mediaeval Sarvakacaras|author=R.Williams|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|pages=34,69,173,227|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=LLKcrIJ6oscC&amp;pg=PA173&amp;dq=tyaga&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=baYAU8qbE8aAhAeavoCgBw&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=tyaga&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vagrich (Vahrij) Hakobi (Akopovich) Bakhchanyan''' ({{lang-ru|Ва́грич Ако́пович Бахчаня́н}}; {{lang-uk|Ва́грiч Ако́пович Бахчаня́н}}; {{lang-hy|Վահրիճ Հակոբի Բախչանյան}}; born May 23, 1938 in [[Kharkiv]], [[Soviet Ukraine]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.futurum-art.ru/autors/bahchanyan.php&lt;/ref&gt; - November 12, 2009, [[New York City]], United States&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kommersant.ru/doc.aspx?DocsID=1273729&lt;/ref&gt;) was a Soviet and American painter, artist and writer-conceptualist (and/or conceptual poet and writer) of Armenian origin and in the [[Russian language|Russian]] language.

==Biography==
He was born to an ethnic [[Armenia]]n family in [[Kharkiv]], [[Ukraine]], where he grew up, studied and began painting. In the mid-1960s he moved to [[Moscow]], where he worked at ''[[Literaturnaya Gazeta]]''. In 1974 Bakhchanyan emigrated to United States, and lived in [[New York City]], where he was active in the literary and art scene. There he collaborated with Russian and Soviet émigré writers [[Sergei Dovlatov]], [[Alexander Genis]], and Naum Sagalovsky (Наум Сагаловський, Kyiv, 1935), among others. He died on November 12, 2009 in New York City. According to Vagrich's last will, his ashes were scattered high in the [[Geghama mountains]] (Armenia), over a stone covered with ancient petroglyphs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/949019386/vagrich-and-the-black-square Vagrich and the Black Square]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Alexander Genis]], Bakhchanyan "possessed a keen sensitivity to the absurdities of the Soviet regime. By developing and experimenting with inventive artistic strategies, Bakhchanyan broadened the range of expressive possibilities for other nonconformist artists. Many of his puns became an intrinsic part of Soviet dissident culture."

[[File:Eight Dimensions of Wellness.png|alt=The Eight Dimensions of Wellness|thumb|The Eight Dimensions of Wellness]]
'''Wellness''' is generally used to mean a state beyond absence of illness but rather aims to optimize [[Quality of life|well-being]].&lt;ref name=NYT2010/&gt;

The notions behind the term share the same roots as the [[alternative medicine]] movement, in 19th-century movements in the US and Europe that sought to optimize health and to consider the whole person, like [[New Thought]], [[Christian Science]], and [[Lebensreform]].&lt;ref name=Kirkland&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kirkland|first1=Anna|title=What Is Wellness Now?|journal=Journal of Health Politics, Policy and Law|date=1 October 2014|volume=39|issue=5|pages=957–970|doi=10.1215/03616878-2813647|url=http://jhppl.dukejournals.org/content/39/5/957|language=en|issn=0361-6878}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Blei|first1=Daniela|title=The False Promises of Wellness Culture|url=https://daily.jstor.org/the-false-promises-of-wellness-culture/|work=JSTOR Daily|date=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was partly inspired by the preamble to the [[World Health Organization]]’s 1948 constitution which said: “Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.”&lt;ref name=NYT2010&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/18/magazine/18FOB-onlanguage-t.html | work=The New York Times | title=Wellness | first=Ben | last=Zimmer | date=2010-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was initially brought to use in the US by [[Halbert L. Dunn| Halbert L. Dunn, M.D.]] in the 1950s; Dunn was the chief of the [[National Center for Health Statistics|National Office of Vital Statistics]] and discussed “high-level wellness,” which he defined as “an integrated method of functioning, which is oriented toward maximizing the potential of which the individual is capable.”&lt;ref name=NYT2010/&gt;  The term "wellness" was then adopted by [[John Travis (physician)|John Travis]] who opened a "Wellness Resource Center" in [[Mill Valley, California]] in the mid-1970s, which was seen by mainstream culture as part of the hedonistic culture of Northern California at that time and typical of the [[Me generation]].&lt;ref name=NYT2010/&gt;  Travis marketed the center as alternative medicine, opposed to what he said was the disease-oriented approach of [[medicine]].&lt;ref name=NYT2010/&gt; The concept was further popularized by [[Robert Rodale]] through [[Prevention (magazine)|''Prevention'' magazine]], Bill Hetler, a doctor at [[University of Wisconsin–Stevens Point]], who set up an annual academic conference on wellness, and Tom Dickey, who established the Berkeley Wellness Letter in the 1980s.&lt;ref name=NYT2010/&gt;  The term had become accepted as standard usage in the 1990s.&lt;ref name=NYT2010/&gt;

By the late 2000s the concept had become widely used in [[employee assistance program]]s in workplaces, and funding for development of such programs in small business was included in the [[Affordable Care Act]].&lt;ref name=Kirkland/&gt;  The use of corporate wellness programs has been criticised as being discriminatory to [[people with disabilities]].&lt;ref&gt;Basas, Carrie Griffin, What's Bad About Wellness? (August 1, 2014). [[Journal of Health Politics, Policy and Law]], Vol. 39, No. 5, 2014. Available at [[SSRN]]: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2478902 &lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, while there were magazines devoted to wellness, it was noted that mainstream news sources had begun to devote more page space to "health and wellness themes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kickbusch |first1=Ilona |authorlink1=Ilona Kickbusch |last2=Payne |first2=Lea |title=Twenty-first century health promotion: the public health revolution meets the wellness revolution |journal=[[Health Promotion International]] |date=1 December 2003 |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=275–278 |doi=10.1093/heapro/dag418}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The US [[Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration]] uses the concept of wellness in its programs, defining it as having eight aspects: emotional, environmental, financial, intellectual, occupational, physical, social, and spiritual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.samhsa.gov/wellness-initiative/eight-dimensions-wellness|title=The Eight Dimensions of Wellness|last=|first=|date=2016|website=Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA)|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The wellness trend has been criticised as a form of [[conspicuous consumption]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Bearne |first1=Suzanne |title=Wellness: just expensive hype, or worth the cost? |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/sep/01/wellness-hype-superfoods-yoga-price |accessdate=7 September 2018 |work=the Guardian |date=1 September 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''widowhood effect''' is the increase in the probability of a person dying a relatively short time  after their long-time [[spouse]] has died. The pattern indicates a sharp increase in risk of death for the widower, particularly but not exclusively, in the three months closest thereafter the death of the spouse. This process of losing a spouse and dying shortly after has also been called "dying of a [[broken heart]]". Becoming a widow is often a very detrimental and life changing time in a spouse's life, that forces them to go through changes that they may not have anticipated to make for a significant amount of time. Responses of grief and bereavement due to the loss of a spouse increases vulnerability to psychological and physical illnesses (Ramadas &amp; Kuttichira, 2013).

Psychologically, losing a long-term spouse can cause symptoms such as depression, anxiety, and feelings of guilt. Physical illness may also occur as the body becomes more vulnerable to emotional and environmental stressors. There are many factors that may be affected when one becomes a widow. A widow (or widower if referring to a male who lost a spouse) tends to have a decline in health regulation. Higher prevalence in mortality rates are noted among bereaved spouses during the first six months of bereavement compared to the last six months of bereavement.  The most crucial are said to be the first three months during grief processing.  Grieving spouses are more vulnerable during these few months not only health wise but socially and physically.  During this early period of bereavement spouses tend to have less interest in their health as well as physical appearance caring less about continuing with medications or adapting healthy behaviors such as eating healthy or exercising.  Also, they are likelier to practice risky behaviors and commit suicide.  Men on the other hand, are more likely to look for social support such as friends, family, or support groups regarding the matter.&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, P. J., Feng, Z., &amp; Raab, G. M. (2011). Does Widowhood Increase Mortality Risk? Epidemiology, 22(1), 1-5. doi:10.1097/ede.0b013e3181fdcc0b&lt;/ref&gt;

This effect appears to be far more prevalent in older married couples than in younger married couples. As a result, studies that have been conducted in regards to this phenomenon since the early 2000s have revolved primarily around observations of older widows. Through the many studies that have been conducted over the years, it has been found that the widowhood effect affects the mortality rates of people with varying levels of severity depending on their genders and religions.{{sfn|Utz|Carr|Nesse|Wortman|2002}}It is far more frequent in more seasoned, long-term, elder couples than in recently married couples. Since the topic has only been recently studied within this last decade, and due to the prevalence of older couples being affected, most widows in similar studies are typically over the age of 50&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-widowhood-effect-idUSBRE9AD0VU20131114|title='Widowhood effect' strongest during first three months|date=2016-11-14|newspaper=Reuters|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Jegtvig, 2013).

Although there have not been many studies, the phenomenon is one of the best documented examples of the effect of social relations on health. Through the numerous studies that have been directed throughout the years, it has been found that the widowhood impact influences the death rates of individuals with changing levels of stringencies relying upon their sexual orientations and religions. There are many theories as to what causes this to occur. There are many factors and theories about the widowhood effect, but in general, a study on a large population sample has suggested rates of death nearly double during the first three months after loss of a spouse, and quickly taper thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moon|first=J.

==Gender differences==

Both men and women respond differently to the death of their spouse. In general, men tend to be more vulnerable to the widowhood effect. Men are affected more socially than women.  Women tend to maintain social relationships and friendships outside of marriage, so when the wife dies first, men tend to lose out on these social relationships and support groups and they tend to isolate themselves. Women maintain their friendships and relationships and lean on them for support after their spouse dies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2136854 Widowhood and Depression: Explaining Long-Term Gender Differences in Vulnerability.] ''Journal of Health and Social Behavior.'' (1992). Retrieved on 2016-12-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of peer-reviewed articles suggest that it is indeed women that are more frequently at risk of succumbing to the widowhood effect. A collaborative study by Gary R. Lee et al. (2001) surveyed 1686 married and widowed people age 65 or older using data from 1988 [[National Survey of Families and Households]]. The study took into account the psychological well-being of each person on a [[Center for Epidemiologic Studies]]— Depression scale (CES-D), and found that women were further depressed by the loss of their spouse than men were. Women were also more likely to die soon after the death of their spouse compared to men. The researchers hypothesized that this was because older married women had a higher baseline happiness than their spouses, so they had more happiness to lose. Women in this study were also less likely to be avid church goers, despised chores, and were not as adept at helping their adult children. The lack of social behavior and general activity may contribute to the widowhood effect's influence on female mortality.&lt;ref name="American Heart Association"&gt;{{cite web |date=April 18, 2016 |title=Is Broken Heart Syndrome Difficult? |url=http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/More/Cardiomyopathy/Is-Broken-Heart-Syndrome-Difficult_UCM_448547_Article.jsp |location=Dallas |publisher=American Heart Association |access-date=August 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Lee|DeMaris|Bavin|Sullivan|2001}}

Experimenters involved in the study regarding: ''The effects of widowhood on physical and mental health, health behaviors, and health outcomes'', took a deeper look into the overall health differences between recent widowers and those who are currently involved in a marriage (Wilcox, Evenson, Aragaki, Wassertheil-Smoller, Mouton, Loevinger, 2003). Mental health alterations include those of depression and socially extracting yourself were the most common for women who have become widowed in the past year or so (Wilcox, Evenson, Aragaki, Wassertheil-Smoller, Mouton, Loevinger, 2003). Although some of these women were shown to extract them selves from social settings, the study also supported an alternate hypothesis that women experiencing the effects of widowhood are less likely to engage coping mechanisms such as support groups, fellow widowers, and overall strong support systems such as close friends and family (Wilcox, Evenson, Aragaki, Wassertheil-Smoller, Mouton, Loevinger, 2003).

In a study done by Stahl and Shultz, they found that the death of a woman’s spouse affected her physical activity (2014). Women’s physical activity increases immediately following the death of a spouse, and the authors note that this may perhaps be a coping mechanism to alleviate depressive symptoms (Stahl &amp; Shultz, 2014). In the year following the death of a spouse, women are more likely to experience a fluctuation in physical activity during the transition into widowhood, if they did not die (Stahl &amp; Shultz, 2014). Women in the youngest age group of this study (55– 65 years) were at the highest risk of mortality after the death of their spouse (Brenn &amp; Ytterstad, 2016). Elwert and Christakis found that within the first month of bereavement after widowhood morality is largest and doesn’t decline sharply until the sixth month of widowhood for females, compared to only the third month for males (2006).

Nicholas A. Christakis of Harvard and Felix Elwert of the University of Wisconsin analyzed 9 years’ worth of data gathered from almost 373,189 elderly married couples in the U.S. Their findings showed an 18 percent increase in “all-cause mortality” for women whose husbands died first; for men, the risk is 16 percent (Elwert 2008). Although the percentage of females was higher than males, it is not a significant difference to state that women are more affected than men. It is hard to say whether males or females suffer from the widowhood effect more, however it is clear that it is higher in couples that are older.

&lt;ref&gt;In conclusion to this, other research that has been conducted has gathered similar statistics regarding widowhood effect between genders. A comparable study taken place in the U.S found that “The death of a husband is associated with a greater rate in all-cause mortality for women, and the death of a wife is associated with a lesser rate in all-cause mortality for men, after adjusting for covariates (Elwert, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mental health effects of widowhood==
The death of a spouse can have a major impact on a person’s mental health. Each individual may respond to their spouse’s death differently. After the death of a spouse many widows begin to take more prescription medications for mental health issues (Avis, Brambilla, Vass, &amp; Mckinlay, 1991). The mental health effects of men and women also differ. Women become more depressed in widowhood compared to men because women may not have as strong of a support group. Married women also report a higher rate of happiness in their marriage and the death of their spouse could drastically alter this happiness. Men may have an easier time adapting to widowhood and be more willing to seek mental help while women tend to be less social and did not like to do chores, go to church, or help their children. Men and women both show greater rates of depression after the death of a spouse but the rates of depression in women tends to be higher than in men (Lee, DeMaris, &amp; Sullivan, 2001).

==Takotsubo and the widowhood effect==

Recently, there has been a phenomenon discussed and researched dubbed the takotsubo condition, also referred to as the [[broken heart syndrome]] (Brenn &amp; Ytterstad, 2016). Takotsubo has been discussed in contexts surrounding great physical and emotional stress, such as circumstance in which someone has been widowed, and emotional stress has long been associated with myocardial infarction. In their research, Brenn and Ytterstad saw an increase in death of women 55–64 years old due to heart disease in the first week of widowhood than married women 55–64 years old (2016). Although takotsubo is not considered to be the direct cause of death at this time, it is an observed phenomenon (Brenn &amp; Ytterstad, 2016.)

==Effects of widowhood on social life==

Elderly widows experience changes in their social lives prior to and following the deaths of their spouses. A study conducted by Rebecca L. Utz et al. (2002) revealed that elderly persons experiencing widowhood spent more time with family and friends than nonwidowed counterparts, based on the lifestyle changes that occur in elderly couples. Although widowed subjects were more likely to socialize with family and friends, they were no more likely to visit church or volunteer than the intact couples. This study also found that healthy spouses were reclusive while their significant other was on their deathbed, but due to a network of family and friends; the surviving spouse entered society being more social than had been prior to the death of their husband or wife. Elderly widows were more or less involved socially depending on the amount of support they had from family and friends.{{sfn|Utz|Carr|Nesse|Wortman|2002}} It has been noted that widows who have a close and supportive social network can counteract the effects of widowhood by remaining active in their social group. The loss of a spouse affects almost every domain of life, and as a consequence has a significant impact on wellbeing: psychological, social, physical, practical, and economic (Bennett, 2012). With all of these aspects of a widowed individuals being affected maintaining a sense of normality is important to help avoid depression like symptoms. Social support, as well as creating new lasting relationships through social interaction can help the process of bereavement go smoother for widow effected individuals.

==Urban, rural and race variations==

A study conducted by Rosato, O’Reilly and Wright (2015) revealed that there is a significant difference in urban-rural variation in the social environment as well as in health outcomes. There is evidence that social support from family and friends have better health outcomes on mortality rates. Investigations showed that the race of the partner influences widowhood effect; whites in endogamous marriages had greater mortality risks that were not obvious among blacks, which the authors concluded was due to a high level of family support for elderly among black families versuswhite families. Moreover, the study also found differences in urban and rural areas around the world. They found that elderly married couples in the US suffered significant mortality risks compared to those in Ireland where older people living in more rural areas receive more social support from their families, and they live with their children, while in the US elderly people live in care homes. As a result, mortality rates are greater in urban areas and less in rural areas.

In a study done by Elwert and Christakis, they found that there was no widowhood effect found in endogamously married black men or women (2016). Deducing this finding, they proposed that this might be because blacks are able to extend their marital survival advantage into widowhood. This is likely because blacks are prone to have kin nearer to help take care of them, they may be more self-sufficient than their white counterparts, and there is greater religious participation in blacks that may help them with spiritual comfort (Elwert &amp; Christakis, 2016). Whites were found to have “a large and enduring widowhood effect” because there is no reparation to make up for the survival advantages that marriage gave them, even if they have been widowed for years (Elwert &amp; Christakis, 2008).

The widowhood effect appears to have a higher impact in rural and intermediate areas compared to urban areas. One factor may be that there are greater distances to primary care services in rural areas, and this increases mortality due to discouraged health checkups (Wright, 2015). It is known that the size of family and social network coincides with physical functioning; the bigger the social group one belongs to the better they can physically function. Residential areas near green areas are associated with an increase in physical activity and lowered mortality (Wright, 2015). Researchers measured peak flow to show the increases or decreases in physical functioning, and the results suggest that married subjects have a higher peak flow compared to those divorced or widowed (Clouston, 2014).

==Possible causes==

It was suggested that the widowhood effect was a mere coincidence resulting from the selection of mates with similar health risk. In a recent study by Paul J. Boyle, Feng, Z., &amp; Raab, G. M. (2011), it was concluded that the increased [[mortality rate]] of widows is caused by the death of their spouse. Researchers in the study used data from the Scottish Longitudinal Study to compare the ratios of death in widowed males and females. The male and female subjects were categorized into different groups dependent on the manner in which their spouse died. The results provided evidence that suggest a causal relationship between mortality rate and widowhood.{{sfn|Boyle|Feng|Raab|2011}}

In April 2016, the [[American Heart Association]] published an article regarding phenomenon referred to as "broken heart syndrome". This particular syndrome seems to occur when a person experiences an overwhelming amount of stress in their life in a short period of time. The cases mentioned involved both positive events like winning the lottery as well as negative events like experiencing the death of a spouse. Though broken heart syndrome has been misdiagnosed as a heart attack, the differences between the two phenomena are clear. Heart attacks are the result of a blockage of arteries, but broken heart syndrome is the result of a hormone induced enlargement of a portion of the heart. The enlarged region of the heart is less effective in regards to pumping blood, and the normal sized regions of the heart are forced to work harder as a result.&lt;ref name="American Heart Association"/&gt;


== Widowhood Effect Solution == 
	Widowhood effect is important to be aware of because of the affects that it can have on the body; mentally, physically, emotionally. Although there is no correct coping mechanism when losing a partner, it is important to find preventative ways to fight this from occurring because of the depressive symptoms and state of mental health that are a result from a partner passing away. Being aware of widowhood effect and acknowledging the feelings, such as grieving over that individual can be a way of coping with their current situation. Individuals that result to safe methods with grieving such as counseling or finding different hobbies can decrease their chances of experiencing widowhood effect. 


== Coping Mechanisms ==
There is no universally accepted “proper” method or way to grieve or adjust to life after loss; it varies among individuals, influenced by their cultural and social practices, personality, and the circumstances surrounding the death. Even though grief processing varies, there are ways to reduce the effects of widowhood. Since a spouse is often one’s primary source of social interactions, maintaining and establishing social bonds is a crucial aspect in determining the outcome of a widowed individual’s bereavement (DeSpelder &amp; Strickland, 2015). Social participation may be utilized “as an active coping strategy” as discovered in a study by Rebecca Utz and colleagues (DeSpelder &amp; Strickland, 2015). Additionally, the loss of a spouse means the loss of a partner; the loss of a supportive presence with whom responsibility was shared amongst one another. Studies have shown that for couples who followed traditional gender roles, adjustment to life after their loss was often more difficult than for couples who did not (DeSpelder &amp; Strickland, 2015). Undertaking the responsibilities previously considered the ‘job’ of one’s deceased partner is often hard to handle on top of processing the loss; therefore, the utilization of organizations built to support and help widowed individuals may also prove to be helpful in reducing grief. The Widowed Persons Service (WPS) and their parent organization, the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), are two organizations which provide aid specifically to widowed individuals (DeSpelder &amp; Strickland, 2015). Effective and safe methods of grief processing are important for all individuals dealing with loss; however, the utilization of organizations may prove to be beneficial for those who need a little more help.

==Origin and definition==
A Woozle is an imaginary character in the [[A. A. Milne]] book ''[[Winnie-the-Pooh (book)|Winnie-the-Pooh]]'', published in 1926. In chapter three, "In which Pooh and Piglet Go Hunting and Nearly Catch a Woozle", [[Winnie-the-Pooh]] and [[Piglet (Winnie-the-Pooh)|Piglet]] start following tracks left in snow believing they are the tracks of an imaginary animal called a ''[[List of Winnie-the-Pooh characters#Woozles|woozle]]''. The tracks keep multiplying until [[Christopher Robin]] explains to them that they have been following their own tracks in circles around a tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Milne |first1 = A. A. |title = Winnie The Pooh |chapter = 3 |edition = 1 |publisher = Methuen &amp; Co Ltd |year = 1926 |location = London |quote = "In Which Pooh and Piglet Go Hunting and Nearly Catch a Woozle"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the introduction of the specific term "Woozle effect", the underlying research phenomenon (and connection to the Woozle) dates back over 60 years. Bevan (1953), writing about scientific methodology and research errors in the field of psychology, uses the term "scientific woozle hunters".&lt;ref name="Bevan1953"&gt;{{cite book |author=William Bevan|title=Modern Psychologists: Scientific Woozle Hunters?: An Opinion in Outline |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iIN7-jP7yBQC|year=1953|publisher=E. Munksgaard}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wohlwill (1963) refers to a "hunt for the woozle" in social science research,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wohlwill |first1=Joachim F. |year=1963 |title=Piaget's system as a source of empirical research |journal=Merrill-Palmer Quarterly of Behavior and Development |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=253–62 |jstor=23082932}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Stevens (1971) cautions readers about woozles in the study of a misquoted letter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stevens |first1=Joan |year=1971 |title=Woozles in Brontëland: A cautionary tale |journal=Studies in Bibliography |volume=24 |issue= |pages=99–108 |jstor=40371529}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Richard J. Gelles]], the term "woozle effect" was coined by Beverly Houghton in 1979.&lt;ref name="Houghton001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gelles, 1980" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Generalization and Containment: Different Effects of Past Aggression for Wives and Husbands|author1=Jean Malone|author2=Andrea Tyree |author3=K.

Straus]] (1988).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1= Dutton |first1= Donald D. |last2= Corvo |first2= Kenneth |title= Transforming a flawed policy: A call to revive psychology and science in domestic violence research and practice |journal= Aggression and Violent Behavior |volume= 11 |issue= 5 |year= 2006 |page= 466 |doi=10.1016/j.avb.2006.01.007|citeseerx= 10.1.1.337.1019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last= Ehrensaft |first= Miriam K. |title= Intimate partner violence: Persistence of myths and implications for intervention |journal= Children and Youth Services Review |volume= 30 |issue= 3 |year= 2009 |pages= 279–86 |doi=10.1016/j.childyouth.2007.10.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gelles and Straus argue that the woozle effect describes a pattern of bias seen within social sciences and which is identified as leading to multiple errors in individual and public perception, academia, policy making and government. A woozle is also a claim made about research which is not supported by original findings.&lt;ref name="GellesStraus1988woozlenoun"&gt;{{cite book| author1=Richard J. Gelles| author2=Murray Arnold Straus| title=Intimate Violence |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_pYoAAAAYAAJ| date=July 1988| publisher=Simon and Schuster| isbn=978-0-671-61752-3 |page=28| chapter=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Dutton, a woozle effect, or a woozle, occurs when frequent citation of previous publications that lack evidence misleads individuals, groups and the public into thinking or believing there is evidence, and non-facts become urban myths and factoids.&lt;ref name="GellesStraus1988"/&gt; The creation of woozles is often linked to the changing of language from qualified ("it may", "it might", "it could") to absolute form ("it is") firming up language and introducing ideas and views not held by an original author or supported by evidence.&lt;ref name="Dutton2006"&gt;{{cite book |author=Donald G. Dutton| title=Rethinking Domestic Violence| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SSJC_usBJ5kC&amp;pg=PA28| date=30 May 2006| publisher=UBC Press |isbn=978-0-7748-1304-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=28}}

Dutton sees the woozle effect as an example of [[confirmation bias]] and links it to [[belief perseverance]] and [[groupthink]].&lt;ref name="Dutton2006"/&gt;{{rp|page=109}} Because in the social sciences empirical evidence may be based on experiential reports rather than objective measurements, there may be a tendency for researchers to align evidence with expectation. According to Dutton it is also possible that the social sciences may be likely to align with contemporary views and ideals of social justice, leading to bias in favor of those ideals.&lt;ref name="Dutton2006" /&gt;{{rp|page=110}} Gambrill (2012) links the woozle effect to the processes that create [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref name="Gambrill2012" &gt;{{cite book |author=Eileen Gambrill |title=Critical Thinking in Clinical Practice: Improving the Quality of Judgments and Decisions |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NsuHtwciwQwC&amp;pg=PA109|date=1 May 2012 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=978-0-470-90438-1 |page=109 |edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gambrill and Reiman (2011) also link it with more deliberate propaganda techniques; they also identify introductory phrases like "Every one knows ...", "It is clear that ...", "It is obvious that ...", "It is generally agreed that ..." as alarm bells that what follows might be a Woozle line of reasoning.&lt;ref name="pone2011" &gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0019516

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1998 book ''Intimate Violence'', Gelles and Straus use the Winnie-the-Pooh woozle to illustrate how poor practice in research and self-referential research causes older research to be taken as fresh evidence causing error and bias.&lt;ref name="GellesStraus1988"/&gt;

In a study conducted by the [[Vera Institute of Justice]], Weiner and Hala (2008) reported some of the research-related difficulties associated with measuring [[human trafficking]].&lt;ref name="Weiner &amp; Hala"&gt;{{cite report |last1=Weiner |first1=Neil A. |last2=Hala|first2=Nicole|year=2008 |title=Measuring human trafficking: Lessons from New York City|journal= |volume=|issue=|pages=|publisher=[[Vera Institute of Justice]] |url= https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/224391.pdf |accessdate=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They describe and map the unfolding of the Woozle effect in connection with [[prevalence]] estimates of human trafficking. Searching the relevant literature between 1990 and 2006, Weiner and Hala found 114 prevalence estimates in 45 publications. Only one of the publications cited [[Original research#Original research|original research]], and several prevalence estimates appeared unsourced.&lt;ref name="Weiner &amp; Hala"/&gt; The authors concluded that the sources they reviewed lacked citations, adequate [[operational definition]], and discussion of [[methodology]].&lt;ref name="Weiner &amp; Hala"/&gt; Stransky and [[David Finkelhor|Finkelhor]] (2008/2012) criticize the general methodology involved in human trafficking research. They cite the Woozle effect (p.&amp;nbsp;3) and post a prominent warning on the first page of their report cautioning against citing any specific estimates they present, as the close inspection of the figures "...reveals that none are based on a strong scientific foundation. (p. 1)"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report | last1=Stransky| first1=Michelle| last2=Finkelhor| first2=David | authorlink2=David Finkelhor |origyear=2008 |year=2012 |title=Sex trafficking of minors:How many juveniles are being prostituted in the US? |journal= |volume= |issue=4 |pages=1–4 |publisher=Crimes Against Children Research Center |url=http://unhinfo.unh.edu/ccrc/pdf/CV279_Revised_Sex_Trafficking_Bulletin.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gambrill and Reiman (2011) analyze scientific papers and mass-market communications about [[social anxiety]] and conclude that many of them engage in [[disease mongering]] by presenting the disease model of social anxiety as an incontrovertible fact by resorting to unchallenged repetition techniques and by leaving out of the discourse any competing theories. Gambrill and Reiman further note that even after educating their subjects about the tell-tale signs of such techniques, many of them still failed to pick up the signs in a practical test.&lt;ref name="pone2011"/&gt;

James J. Kimble gives as an example the 1994–2015 historiography of the 1943 American "[[We Can Do It!]]" wartime poster. After Michigan resident [[Geraldine Hoff Doyle]] said in 1994 that she was the real-life model for the poster, many sources repeated her assertion without checking the two foundational assumptions: that Doyle was the young factory worker pictured in a 1942 wartime photograph, and that the photograph had inspired commercial artist [[J. Howard Miller]] to create the poster. Though some media representations described the connection as unconfirmed, many more enthusiastically endorsed it. The weight of these multiple endorsements gave Doyle's story a "convincing" authority, despite the lack of authority in establishing the connection. In 2015 Kimble found the original photographic print of the factory worker, its caption identifying the young woman as [[Naomi Parker]], working in California in March 1942, when Doyle was still in high school.&lt;ref name=Kimble2016&gt;{{cite journal |title=Rosie's Secret Identity, or, How to Debunk a Woozle by Walking Backward through the Forest of Visual Rhetoric |last=Kimble |first=James J. |date=Summer 2016 |journal=Rhetoric and Public Affairs |volume=19 |number=2 |pages=245–74 |issn=1094-8392 |doi=10.14321/rhetpublaffa.19.2.0245}}&lt;/ref&gt;
