[[File:Academia de la Llingua Asturiana 1.jpg|thumb|350px|Current headquarters at [[Oviedo]]]]
The '''Academia de la Llingua Asturiana''' or '''Academy of the Asturian Language''' (ALLA) is an Official Institution&lt;ref&gt;Official Decret of Asturian Regional Council 33/1980 15 December, and approved by Decret 9/1981, modified 12 April 1995 (BOPA number 136 of 14.6.1995)[http://www.asturias.es/bopa/1995/06/14/19950614.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt; of the Government of the [[Principality of Asturias]] that promotes and regulates the [[Asturian language]], a language of the [[Spanish people|Spanish]] [[autonomous community]] of [[Asturias]]. Among its principal objectives are investigating and normalizing the Asturian Language, developing a dictionary, promoting its use and education and awarding literary prizes. It has 21 full members, 19 foreign members and 15 honorary members, and its current (as of 2006) president is Ana María Cano González.

==History==
[[File:Oviedo08.jpg|thumb|200px|The sign in front of the old offices in [[Oviedo]].]]
'''ALLA''' first notice appears in the 18th century, when [[Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos]] and  Carlos González de Posada talk in their letters about the idea of creating it in 1791. Jovellanos' project, however, was aborted because of his imprisonment in [[Majorca]]. 

In 1920s the Real Academia Asturiana de las Artes y las Letras (Royal Academy of Asturian Arts and Letters) was created by some intellectuals, including José Antonio García Peláez (Pin de Pría). It was divided in four sections and its principal objectives were to create an Asturian dictionary and grammar and to publish a magazine. Other sections were dedicated to promoting Asturian literature, theatre and music.

But it was from 1980 when the Asturian pre-autonomous government, the Consejo Regional, approved the creation of the '''ALLA''', founded 15 December of the same year. [[Xosé Lluis García Arias]] was its first president from that moment until 2001 when [[Ana Cano]] took over from him.

==Works==
In 1981 the ''Normes Ortográfiques y Conxugación de Verbos'' (''Orthographic Norms and Verb Conjugation''), the first academic work, was published. Other publications followed, such as the ''Gramática de la Llingua Asturiana'' (''Asturian Language Grammar'') in 1998 and the ''Diccionariu de la Llingua Asturiana'' (''Asturian Language Dictionary'') in 2000, also known as «DALLA».

The '''ALLA''' also publish: 
* a bulletin featuring literary and linguistic studies about the Asturian language, called ''[[Lletres Asturianes]]'' (''Asturian Letters'') [http://www.academiadelallingua.com/comun.php?seccion=lletres], 
* and another one with anthropological studies about Asturias: ''Cultures''. 
It also works as an editorial house, with book collections, such as: 
* ''Escolín'' (''Student'', children literature), 
* ''Llibrería facsimilar'' (''Facsimile library''), 
* ''Cartafueyos de lliteratura escaecida'' (''Notes on forgotten literature'', ancient works in Asturian Language), 
* ''Llibrería llingüística'' (''Linguistic Library'', linguistic studies) [http://www.academiadelallingua.com/comun.php?seccion=publicaciones&amp;id_p=00000004], 
* or ''Llibrería académica'' (''Academical library'', literature).

It also organized every year the ''Dia de les lletres asturianes'' (Day of Asturian Letters) since 1982, on the first Friday of May.

==List of members==
As of 2008, this is the complete list of members of the Academy of Asturian Language&lt;ref&gt;(Asturian) Academy of the Asturian Language website [http://academiadelallingua.com/comun.php?seccion=entamu] (Law 1/98 of use and promotion of Asturian language)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3570">'''Adusted RevPAR''' (or '''ARPAR''', adjusted revenue per available room), is a performance metric used in the hotel industry. It is calculated by dividing the variable net revenues of a property by the total available rooms (see more formulas below).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=7 Methods for Measuring and Improving Hotel Performance|url=https://www.amadeus-hospitality.com/insight/measuring-and-improving-hotel-performance/|website=Amadeus Hospitality|accessdate=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The difference between ARPAR and other metrics ([[RevPAR]], [[TRevPAR]], [[GOPPAR]]) is that it accounts for variable costs and additional revenues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sunny|first1=Kiran|title=Neither revPAR nor occupancy are ideal indicators of hotel profitability – it’s all about the ARPAR!|url=https://www.hospitalitynet.org/opinion/4077407.html|website=HospitalityNet|publisher=Hotelogix|accessdate=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Calculations==
Various formulas can be used to calculate ARPAR&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vouk|first1=Ira|title=REVENUE MANAGEMENT MADE EASY, for Midscale and Limited-Service Hotels: The 6 Strategic Steps for Becoming the Most Valuable Person at Your Property.|date=Mar 31, 2018|publisher=Ira Vouk Revenue Management Services|isbn=978-1-387-70254-1|pages=18-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* (Room Revenue + Other Revenues – VarCPOR х Number of occupied rooms) / Total Number of rooms available for sale

* (Room Revenue/Number of occupied rooms + Other Revenues/Number of occupied rooms – VarCPOR) x Occupancy

* [(Room Revenue/Number of occupied rooms + Other Revenues/Number of occupied rooms – VarCPOR) х Number of occupied rooms] / (Number of rooms at the hotel x Number of days in the period)

where VarCPOR is Variable Costs per Occupied Room

The most commonly used formula is:

*ARPAR = (ADR – Var costs per occ room + Additional revenues per occ room) x Occupancy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=From RevPAR to TRevPAR – how profitable is your hotel?|url=https://www.customer-alliance.com/en/articles/revpar/|website=Customer Alliance Resources|accessdate=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ADR, Occupancy Rate, RevPar, ARPar|url=https://quizlet.com/186158756/adr-occupancy-rate-revpar-arpar-flash-cards/|website=Quizlet|accessdate=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==How it compares to RevPAR==
ARPAR accounts for variable costs and additional revenues, thus it reflects the profit (bottom line) versus top line revenue.

==How it compares to GOPPAR==
GOPPAR accounts for all costs (not only variable) and is retroactive. ARPAR considers revenues from all departments and only var costs and can be used in forecasts.

==Conditions==
*    There is no standard formula for CPOR (cost per occupied room) in the industry and no standardization in regards to separating variable costs from fixed, which requires approximation when calculating VarCPOR. However, these calculations are only performed once.
*    Due to the above, ARPAR of each individual property can not be compared to others and is intended for internal use only.

[[Image:Landscape in Sa Pa (Vietnam).jpg|320x320px|thumb|right|An example of advanced anthropization: the cultivation of [[rice]] in [[Terrace (agriculture)|terraces]] in [[Vietnam]]]]

In [[geography]] and [[ecology]], '''anthropization''' is the conversion of open spaces, landscapes, and [[natural environment]]s by human action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hypergeo.eu/spip.php?article312|title=Anthropization - Hypergéo|website=www.hypergeo.eu|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropic erosion is the process of human action degrading [[terrain]] and [[soil]].

An area may be classified as anthropized even though it looks natural, such as [[grassland]]s that have been [[Deforestation|deforested]] by humans. It can be difficult to determine how much a site has been anthropized in the case of [[urbanization]] because one must be able to estimate the state of the landscape before significant human action.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

== Cause ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}
The earliest known stages of anthropization can be found as early as the Neolithic era and the basic farmland created in that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hypergeo.eu/spip.php?article312|title=Anthropization - Hypergéo|website=www.hypergeo.eu|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
With the continually-growing population of humans, the land that the Earth provides has been appropriated over the years.  The ecological footprint created by anthropization is continually growing despite efficiency and technique improvements made in anthropization..

Whether anthropized or not, all land seldom a few [[Territorial claims in Antarctica|locations]] has been claimed.  Outside of the largely inhospitable [[Arctic Circle|Arctic]] and [[Antarctic Circle|Antarctic]] circles and large portions of other uninhabitable landscapes, much of the globe has been used or altered in some direct way by humans.  Land has been appropriated for many different reasons, but ultimately the outcome is typically a short-term benefit for humans.  An area is anthropized is some way to make land available for housing, to harvest the resources, to create space for some anthropological reason, or many other possibilities.

== Processes and effects ==
{{refimprove section|date=January 2017}}
[[File:Farm in Hainan 01.jpg|thumb|An example of land that has been appropriated for [[Horticulture|cultivation]] in [[Hainan]], [[China]].]]

=== Agriculture ===
The root of many early forms of civilization, [[agriculture]] has been a primary reason for anthropization. To cultivate food or breed animals, humans must alter land—till soil or build structures—to facilitate agriculture.  This can lead to [[soil erosion]] and [[pollution]] ([[pesticide]]s, [[greenhouse gas]] emissions, etc.), and subsequently [[habitat fragmentation]] and overall an increased [[ecological footprint]]. Agriculture and industry often overlap, and industry produces many of these effects too.

=== Urban development ===
Especially with approximately 7.5 Billion humans inhabiting the [[Earth]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/|title=World Population Clock: 7.5 Billion People (2017) - Worldometers|website=www.worldometers.info|language=en|access-date=2017-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; this typically aligns with an increase in residences worldwide.  Over the years, humans have built on land to meet their needs and wants. These actions range from small villages to massive factories, water parks, and apartments.  [[Urbanization]] and development of human residences can significantly affect the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]].  Not only does the physical space of buildings fragment habitats and possibly endanger [[Endangered species|species]], but it fundamentally alters the habitat for any other living being.  For some species, this effect can be inconsequential, but for many this can have a dramatic impact.  The biosphere is very much interconnected, and this means that if one organism is affected, then as a result the other organisms within this ecosystem and food chain are also affected.  
[[File:Athabasca oil sands.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Athabasca oil sands|Athabasca]] oil sands are an example of anthropization as a result of the harvest and transport of a non-renewable resource, [[oil sands]].]]
As well, within the last century, any urbanized area requires roads for transportation.  This transportation is a continued source of pollution, and the roads can be a source of soil erosion.

=== Industry and technology ===
To support humans, industrial buildings and processes are apparently essential. Urban development and agriculture require that people produce, refined, or construct many things. Key to this is that factories require that people gather the materials they need to create a product. The wide range of products in this anthropological age use a plethora of substances that must be harvested or produced.  Many of these materials are [[Non-renewable resource|non-renewable]] (e.g., fossil fuel, metal ores, etc.) and the harvest of these results in relatively permanent anthropization. For resources that depend on in high quantity, this can also mean temporary depletion or damage to the source of the resource (e.g., depletion or pollution of fresh water reserves,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://puredrinkablewater.weebly.com/how-water-sources-are-being-depleted.html|title=How Water Sources are Being Depleted|website=PureDrinkableWater|access-date=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; improper or inefficient [[silviculture]], etc.).  Even sustainable or renewable industrial anthropization still affects the environment.  While the resource in question may not be in jeopardy, the harvest and processing can still change and damage the environment.

==== Science ====
Anthropization can also be a result of scientific endeavours.  This can manifest as construction of structures to aid in scientific discovery and observation.  This can range from structures such as [[Observatory|observatories]], or on the opposite scale the [[Large Hadron Collider]].  These and many other things are built and used to enhance knowledge of sciences. They do however require space and energy.

==== Energy ====
To power the ever-growing human race, energy is needed.  Power-harvesting structures are built to harness energy, such as dams, windmills, and nuclear reactors.  These sources of energy ultimately fuel the rest of anthropological activity and are essential in this way.  However many of these methods have consequences.  With dams, construction aside, they can cause flooding, habitat fragmentation, and other effects.  With nuclear reactors, they have a lasting effect in that typically a lifespan of one of these is around 50 years&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/nuclear-power-plant-aging-reactor-replacement-/|title=How Long Can a Nuclear Reactor Last?|last=Voosen|first=Paul|newspaper=Scientific American|language=en|access-date=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and afterwards the nuclear waste must be dealt with, and the structure itself must be shut down and cannot be used further.  To safely dispose of this even low-level waste can take hundreds of years, ranging upwards with increased radioactivity.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, G. Tyler, David F. Hackett, and Carl Eric Wolfe. ''Living in the Environment''. 4th ed. Toronto: Nelson Education, 2017. 454-55. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  To produce and as a result of this production of energy, it requires a lot of anthropized land.

== Evolution of anthropization ==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}
[[File:All pyramids of Giza panorama 2.jpg|thumb|462x100px|An example of ancient anthropization; Giza pyramid complex, Egypt.]]

Changes in population directly effect anthropological impact—but changes in technology and knowledge have greatly changed anthropization throughout the [[Holocene]]. The tools and methods that humans use to anthropize have changed drastically.  For examples, the great [[pyramid]]s in [[Egypt]] were not constructed by some large machine, but instead by thousands of humans.  They were still able to build massive monuments, but the efficiency of their efforts and environmental damage is much different than today.  This shows that the environmental effect of modern anthropization is generally greater, not just because of the increase in population. Pollution and loss of [[biodiversity]] in Egypt was largely natural, not man-made, and anthropization existed on a much lower level.

As the human population of Earth increase, this anthropization will continue to evolve.

'''Baa''', also known as ''Kwa, Kwah'', is a [[Niger–Congo language]] of uncertain affiliation; the more it has been studied, the more divergent it appears. Joseph Greenberg counted it as one of the [[Waja–Jen languages]] of the [[Adamawa languages|Adamawa family]]. Boyd (1989) assigned it its own branch within Waja–Jen. Kleinewillinghöfer (1996) removed it from Waja–Jen as an independent branch of Adamawa. When Blench (2008) broke up Adamawa, Baa became a provisional independent branch of his larger [[Savanna languages|Savannas family]].

'''Baima''' (autonym: ''pe53''&lt;ref name="Sun2007"/&gt;) is a language spoken by 10,000 [[Baima people]], of [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] nationality, in north central [[Sichuan Province]], and Gansu Province, [[China]]. Baima is passed on from parents to children in Baima villages. It is spoken within the home domain and is not used in any media of mass communication.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.endangeredlanguages.com/lang/5614|title=Did you know Baima is threatened?|website=Endangered Languages|access-date=2016-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baima is often classified as a Sino-Tibetan dialect and is currently endangered.

In terms of geographical locations, Baima is spoken in:
*[[Pingwu County]], [[Mianyang]], [[Sichuan]] 四川
*Baimaguhe 白马谷河, [[Wen County, Gansu|Wen County]] 文县, [[Gansu]] 甘肃
*Wujiao 物角村, [[Jiuzhaigou County]] 九寨沟县, [[Ngawa Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture]], [[Sichuan]] 四川

Baima uses [[subject–object–verb]] (SOV) word order, initial consonant word clusters and is [[tonal language|tonal]]. It is unclassified within Sino-Tibetan; there are multiple layers of borrowings from [[Amdo language|Amdo]], [[Khams language|Khams]], and [[Zhongu language|Zhongu]] Tibetan, as well as lexical and grammatical connections with [[Qiangic languages]]. Basic vocabulary is about 85% Tibetic and 15% Qiangic, and the Tibetic words do not link to any established group of Tibetic languages. Chirkova (2008) suggests that the Qiangic vocabulary "might be a retention from the language originally spoken by the Báimǎ before their shift to a form of Tibetic in the 7th century." She accepts Baima as Tibetan, but as an isolate within the Tibetic languages.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Katia Chirkova, 2008, "On the position of Báimǎ within Tibetan", in Lubotsky et al (eds), ''Evidence and Counter-Evidence'', vol. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Baima speakers number around 10,000 and have lived for generations in the mountainous region spanning the borders of Sichuan Province and Gansu Province. After the establishment of the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1949, Baima speakers have requested to grant them recognition as an independent ethnic group on many occasions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sun|first=Hongkai|title=Is Baima a dialect or vernacular of Tibetan ?|url=http://www.persee.fr/doc/clao_0153-3320_2003_num_32_1_1626|journal=Cahiers de Linguistique Asie Orientale|volume=32|issue=1|pages=61–81|doi=10.3406/clao.2003.1626}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historians believe that the Baima are decedents of the ancient Di people in China.&lt;ref name="persee.fr"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.persee.fr/doc/clao_0153-3320_2003_num_32_1_1626|title=Is Baima a dialect or vernacular of Tibetan ? – Persée|website=www.persee.fr|access-date=2016-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese records from 551 AD mention that The Di are also called Baima. One historian states, "The Baima tribe was the largest tribe of the Di nationality, which lived in Gansu, Sichuan and Shaanxi during the Three Kingdoms Period (220–265 AD)."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://joshuaproject.net/people_groups/10576/CH|title=Baima in China|last=Project|first=Joshua|website=joshuaproject.net|access-date=2016-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tibetans invaded the Di territory in the 7th century and assimilated the local population, which probably subsequently shifted into a form of Tibetan spoken by the invaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wTdyv6cF3RgC|title=Evidence and Counter-evidence: General linguistics|last=Lubotsky|first=Alexander|last2=Schaeken|first2=Jos|last3=Wiedenhof|first3=Jeroen|date=2008-01-01|publisher=Rodopi|isbn=9042024712|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linguists consider Baima to be an independent language of the Tibetan branch but the language itself has been greatly influenced by Tibetan.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition, DNA specialists have discovered that the Baima are genetically closer to the Qiang people than to the Tibetans.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Dialects ==
There are distinctions within the Baima language itself. Baima is mainly divided into three dialect groups: Southern Baima (Pingwu Baima), Northern Baima (Wenxian Baima), Western Baima (Jiuzhaigou Baima, Songpan Baima).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/language/bqh|title=Baima|website=Ethnologue|access-date=2016-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Baima spoken in Jiuzhaigou and surrounding areas differs from that spoken in Songpan County in the Aba Tibetan-Qiang Autonomous Prefecture and Wenxian County in Gansu Province.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Sun Hongkai, et al. (2007)&lt;ref name="Sun2007"&gt;Sun Hongkai, et al. (2007). ''Baimayu yanjiu'' 白马语研究. Beijing: Ethnic Publishing House 民族出版社.&lt;/ref&gt; document the following three dialects of Baima.
*[[Pingwu County]], [[Sichuan]]
*Tielou (铁楼藏族乡), [[Wen County, Gansu]]
*Wujiao (勿角乡), [[Jiuzhaigou County]], [[Sichuan]]

== Classification ==

The classification of Baima has caused controversy among linguists. Baima is provisionally classified with the Khams group, although it also has a number of Amdo characteristics.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Reasons for this are presumably the drastic simplification of the syllable structure, the elimination of ancient Tibetan syllables codas and the presence of tones.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; While many scholars believe that Baima is a separate Tibeto-Burma subgroup in its own right, others believe that it should be identified as a Tibetan dialect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4eR_AgAAQBAJ|title=The Origins of Himalayan Studies: Brian Houghton Hodgson in Nepal and Darjeeling|last=Waterhouse|first=David|date=2004-10-28|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1134383630|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Baima and Tibetan share many basic similarities, they are essentially different. In fact, the differences between Baima and Tibetan far exceeded those existing between the three main Tibetan dialects spoken within Chinese territory.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Therefore, Baima scholar, Sun Hognkai, argued that "Baima should be considered an independent language which is different from Tibetan but which belongs to the Tibetan branch."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Vocabulary ==
Overall, Baima vocabulary is highly heterogeneous. It consists predominantly of transparent Tibetan provenance and appears to combine features of Khams and Amdo.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Ekaterina Chirkova. On the Position of Baima within Tibetan: A Look from Basic Vocabulary. Alexander Lubotsky, Jos Schaeken and Jeroen Wiedenhof. Rodopi, pp.23, 2008, Evidence and counter-evidence: Festschrift F. Kortlandt. &lt;halshs-00104311&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; However, sound correspondences between sound system of ancient Tibetan, as reflected in standard Written Tibetan orthography and Baima are less regular than those between Written Tibetan orthography and established groups of Modern Tibetan dialects.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Baima vocabulary also exhibits two features which are not present in all other dialects: first, voicing of voiceless aspirated stops and affricates after nasal prefixes; second, the treatment of written Tibetan orthography.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Further more, Baima has some words that are of unclear etymology, even in its basic vocabulary. The proportion of these words has never been estimated, nor has basic vocabulary ever been the topic of detailed investigation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In Ekaterina Chirkova's article, On the Position of Baima within Tibetan: A Look from Basic Vocabulary, she examined the 100-word Swadesh list for Baima, as the layer of lexicon which is arguably least resistible to change and which therefore can shed light on the genetic affiliation of this language.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; She then discovered that the 100-word Swadesh list for Báimǎ contains 84 words of Tibetan origin, 15 words of unclear origin and another 7 words with partial cognation, in which one element is of unidentified origin. 4 words are doublets, most of which combine one word of unclear origin with a word of Tibetan origin.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; According to her analysis, Baima has a simple syllable structure. All Baima syllables are open an have the (n)(C)V makeup, where "n" stands for prenasalization and is homorganic with the following consonant.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Most Baima verbs have two stems, the imperfective, marked by prenasalization and mostly the high falling tone, and the perfective/imperative, marked by the high rising tone.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Baima verbs have [[Directionality (grammar)|directional aspect]], with different prefixes combining with verbs to represent progression of an action in a specific direction.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Using prefixes to show directional aspect is an important and unique feature in Baima language. In sum, Chirkova concluded that Baima diverge significantly in lexicon and phonology from the established groups of Tibetan dialects.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Grammar ==
[[File:Transcriptions of different words from Baima, Kham, and Amdo in Tibetan and Chinese Documents.png|thumb|Transcriptions of different words from Baima, Kham, and Amdo in Tibetan and Chinese Documents by Song Hongkai]]
* Baima dual and plural pronouns for the first person have inclusive an exclusive forms. Baima singular personal pronouns have nominative accusative forms, which are expressed by inflectional changes in the vowels. The forms of Baima pronouns for the third person, whether singular, dual, or plural, are very different from those in the Tibetan dialects.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* In comparison to Tibetan, Baima has many more classifiers. Among the over 3,000 common lexical items included in A Study of the Baima lexicon transcribed in Tibetan and Chinese, there were over 110 specific or loan classifiers. For instance, in Baima, there are many different words for the numeral "one" which can combine with classifiers and the reason for it is unclear. An increasing number of classifiers also led to an increase in their function in Baima grammar, while the ways in which they are used are also changing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* [[Directionality (grammar)|Directionality]] is an important grammatical feature in Baima.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Baima has a large number of case-marking articles, which perform very important syntactic functions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Phonology ==
The phonology of Baima is very similar to that of the Kham Tibetan dialect. They have both retained a voiced–voiceless contrast and have 4–5 contrastive tones as opposed to Amdo dialect.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Affricates: four sets of affricates exist in the Baima language. They are apical, retroflex, laminal and pre-laminal.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Rhymes: Baima rhymes are very similar to the Kham Tibetan dialect but its vowel system is much more complex. Codas have essentially been lost and vowels show considerable differentiation, with the appearance of many back diphthongs. In general, the number of tones in Baima is also similar to Kham Tibetan. But the correspondences between Baima tones, onsets, and rhymes with written Tibetan are not as clear as those between Khan Tibetan and written Tibetan.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Controversy ==
The status of the Baima language has caused major controversy among scholars and the people within the region. As a native language spoken by the natives in the Tibetan region, Baima certainly shared similarities with Tibetan dialects. Although the Baima people have sought after their claims as an independent ethnic group since the 1960s, the Baima language remained classified as a Tibetan dialect. According to linguistic research conducted by Baima scholars such as Song Hongkai, Nishida Tatsuo, and Katia Chirkova, who extensively analyzed the grammatical, lexical, and phonological differences between Baima and Tibetan, Baima should not be regarded as a Tibetan dialect, but instead, an independent language within the Tibetan branch. Because of its status as a minority language, the use of Baima is limited to religious ceremonies and intercommunication between Baima villages, which significantly furthered the endangerment of Baima language. Additionally, the language of communication with neighboring communities throughout all Baima-inhabited areas is Mandarin Chinese.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.katia-chirkova.info/projects/baima/|title=Katia Chirkova {{!}} The Baima Language Project|website=www.katia-chirkova.info|access-date=2016-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; As for the Baima people themselves, they were never officially reclassified as an individual ethnic group rather than a branch of Tibetans, as "reclassification of ethnic groups listed as Tibetans remains a sensitive issue in the PRC, and is considered by many Tibetans as an attack on Tibetan identity by the Chinese government."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; As a result, the Baima language remains poorly documented till this day and continues to raise the question of language in the role of cultural survival.

'''Basketo''' (also known as Basketto, Baskatta, Mesketo, Misketto, and Basketo-Dokka) is an [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] language spoken in the [[Basketo special woreda]] of the [[Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples Region]], which is part of [[Ethiopia]].&lt;ref name=e18/&gt; The speakers refer to the language as "Masketo", while their neighbors refer to it as "Basketo." It has said to consist of two dialects, "Doko" (Dokko) and "Dollo" (Dollo). Besides their mother tongue, some also speak [[Melo language|Melo]], [[Oyda language|Oyda]], [[Galila language|Galila]], or [[Gofa language|Gofa]].&lt;ref&gt;Alemayehu Abebe, [http://www.sil.org/silesr/2002/SILESR2002-067.pdf "Sociolinguistic Survey Report of the Mesketo Language of Ethiopia"], SIL Electronic Survey Reports SILESR 2002-067.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7988">In [[mathematics]], specifically in [[operator K-theory]], the '''Baum&amp;ndash;Connes conjecture''' suggests a link between the [[operator K-theory|K-theory]] of the  [[reduced C*-algebra]] of a [[group theory|group]] and the [[K-homology]] of the [[classifying space]] of [[proper action]]s of that group. The conjecture sets up a correspondence between different areas of mathematics, with the K-homology of the classifying space being related to geometry, [[differential operator]] theory, and [[homotopy theory]], while the K-theory of the group's reduced C*-algebra is a purely analytical object.

The conjecture, if true, would have some older famous conjectures as consequences. For instance, the surjectivity part implies the Kadison–[[Kaplansky conjecture]] for a discrete [[torsion-free group]], and the injectivity is closely related to the [[Novikov conjecture]].

The conjecture is also closely related to [[index theory]], as the [[assembly map]] &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is a sort of index, and it plays a major role in [[Alain Connes]]' [[noncommutative geometry]] program.

The origins of the conjecture go back to [[Fredholm theory]], the [[Atiyah–Singer index theorem]] and the interplay of geometry with operator K-theory as expressed in the works of Brown, Douglas and Fillmore, among many other motivating subjects.

==Formulation==
Let Γ be a [[Second-countable space|second countable]] [[locally compact group]] (for instance a countable [[discrete group]]). One can define a [[morphism]]
:&lt;math&gt; \mu\colon RK^\Gamma_*(\underline{E\Gamma}) \to K_*(C^*_r(\Gamma)),&lt;/math&gt;
called the '''assembly map''', from the equivariant K-homology with &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;-compact supports of the classifying space of proper actions &lt;math&gt;\underline{E\Gamma}&lt;/math&gt; to the K-theory of the [[reduced C*-algebra]] of Γ. The subscript index &lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt; can be 0 or 1.

[[Paul Baum (mathematician)|Paul Baum]] and [[Alain Connes]] introduced the following conjecture (1982) about this morphism:

:The assembly map μ is an [[isomorphism]].

As the left hand side tends to be more easily accessible than the right hand side, because there are hardly any general structure theorems of the &lt;math&gt;C^*&lt;/math&gt;-algebra, one usually views the conjecture as an "explanation" of the right hand side.

The original formulation of the conjecture was somewhat different, as the notion of equivariant K-homology was not yet common in 1982.

In case &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is discrete and torsion-free, the left hand side reduces to the non-equivariant K-homology with compact supports of the ordinary classifying space &lt;math&gt;B\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;.

There is also more general form of the conjecture, known as Baum–Connes conjecture with coefficients, where both sides have coefficients in the form of a &lt;math&gt;C^*&lt;/math&gt;-algebra &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; on which &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; acts by &lt;math&gt;C^*&lt;/math&gt;-automorphisms. It says in [[KK-theory|KK-language]] that the assembly map
:&lt;math&gt; \mu_{A,\Gamma}\colon RKK^\Gamma_*(\underline{E\Gamma},A) \to K_*(A\rtimes_\lambda \Gamma),&lt;/math&gt;
is an isomorphism, containing the case without coefficients as the case &lt;math&gt;A=\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;.

However, counterexamples to the conjecture with coefficients were found in 2002 by [[Nigel Higson]], [[Vincent Lafforgue]] and [[Georges Skandalis]]. However, the conjecture with coefficients remains an active area of research, since it is, not unlike the classical conjecture, often seen as a statement concerning particular groups or class of groups.

==Examples==

Let &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; be the integers &lt;math&gt;\Z&lt;/math&gt;. Then the left hand side is the [[K-homology]] of &lt;math&gt;B\Z&lt;/math&gt; which is the circle. The &lt;math&gt;C^*&lt;/math&gt;-algebra of the integers is by the commutative Gelfand–Naimark transform, which reduces to the [[Fourier transform]] in this case, isomorphic to the algebra of continuous functions on the circle. So the right hand side is the topological K-theory of the circle. One can then show that the assembly map is [[KK-theory|KK-theoretic]] [[Poincaré duality]] as defined by [[Gennadi Kasparov]], which is an isomorphism.

Another simple example is given by compact groups. In this case, both sides identify naturally with the complex [[representation ring]] &lt;math&gt;R(K)&lt;/math&gt; of the group in such a way that the assembly map becomes the identity.

==Results==

The conjecture without coefficients is still open, although the field has received great attention since 1982.
The conjecture is proved for the following classes of groups:
* Discrete subgroups of [[Indefinite orthogonal group|&lt;math&gt;SO(n,1)&lt;/math&gt;]] and &lt;math&gt;SU(n,1)&lt;/math&gt;.
* Groups with the [[Haagerup property]], sometimes called [[a-T-menability|a-T-menable groups]]. These are groups that admit an isometric action on an affine Hilbert space &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; which is proper in the sense that &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty} g_n\xi\to\infty&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;\xi\in H&lt;/math&gt; and all sequences of group elements &lt;math&gt;g_n&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty}g_n\to\infty&lt;/math&gt;. Examples of a-T-menable groups are [[amenable group]]s, [[Coxeter group]]s, groups acting properly on [[Tree (graph theory)|trees]], and groups acting properly on simply connected [[CAT(k) space|&lt;math&gt;CAT(0)&lt;/math&gt;]] cubical complexes.
* Groups that admit a [[Presentation of a group|finite presentation]] with only one relation.
* Discrete cocompact subgroups of real Lie groups of real rank 1.
* Cocompact lattices in &lt;math&gt;SL(3,\mathbb{R})&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;SL(3,\mathbb{C})&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;SL(3,\mathbb{Q}_p)&lt;/math&gt;. It was a long-standing problem since the first days of the conjecture to expose a single infinite [[Kazhdan's property (T)|property T-group]] that satisfies it. However, such a group was given by V. Lafforgue in 1998 as he showed that cocompact lattices in &lt;math&gt;SL(3,\mathbb{R})&lt;/math&gt; have the property of rapid decay and thus satisfy the conjecture.
* [[Hyperbolic group|Gromov hyperbolic groups]] and their subgroups.
* Among non-discrete groups, the conjecture has been shown in 2003 by J. Chabert, S. Echterhoff and R. Nest for the vast class of all almost connected groups (i. e. groups having a cocompact connected component), and all groups of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-rational points of a [[linear algebraic group]] over a [[local field]] &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; of characteristic zero (e.g. &lt;math&gt;k = \mathbb{Q}_p&lt;/math&gt;). For the important subclass of real reductive groups, the conjecture had already been shown in 1987 by [[Antony Wassermann]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=894996 MathSciNet bibliographic data]&lt;/ref&gt;
Injectivity is known for a much larger class of groups thanks to the Dirac-dual-Dirac method. This goes back to ideas of [[Michael Atiyah]] and was developed in great generality by [[Gennadi Kasparov]] in 1987.
Injectivity is known for the following classes:
* Discrete subgroups of connected Lie groups or virtually connected Lie groups.
* Discrete subgroups of [[P-adic number|p-adic groups]].
* Bolic groups (a certain generalization of hyperbolic groups).
* Groups which admit an amenable action on some compact space.

The simplest example of a group for which it is not known whether it satisfies the conjecture is &lt;math&gt;SL_3(\Z)&lt;/math&gt;.

The [[Lutheran]] pastor [[Johann Ernst Glück]] translated the Bible into the [[Latvian language]] in 1685. 

This translation was republished many times, repeatedly re-edited. Most recently a revision was begun in 1931 and printed in 1965 by the [[United Bible Societies]], London. For this the main language editor was Professor [[Ernests Blese]]. This translation used the traditional "ch" and "ŗ" of pre-war [[Latvia]] and [[Latvian people|Latvians]] in exile. 

In 1995 [[The Latvian Bible Society]] (LBB) began work on a new Bible translation; [[Gospels and Acts]] 1999, the whole [[New Testament]] 2007. The Publishing House "Zinātne" ("Science") has issued a number of Old Testament books in some editions, but the LBB's Old Testament translation is still being prepared for publication. In 2005 the Latvian Bible Society issued the Deuterocanonical books.

'''C. N. Sreekantan Nair''' (1928–1976) was a [[Malayalam]] writer and playwright.

He is probably best known for his ''[[Ramayana]]'' trilogy – ''[[Kanchana Sita (play)|Kanchana Sita]]'', ''Saketham'' and ''Lankalakshmi'' – based on the epic ''Ramayana''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/fr/2010/02/12/stories/2010021251310500.htm|author= Suganthy Krishnamachari|title=Dialogue was its forte|date=12 February 2010|publisher=''[[The Hindu]]''|accessdate=11 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poet and scholar [[Ayyappa Panicker]] had observed that ''Lankalakshmi'' brought out the playwright in Sreekantan Nair, while ''Saketham'' and ''Kanchana Sita'' highlighted the poet and the philosopher in the playwright.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Anand Haridas|url=http://www.hindu.com/fr/2011/01/14/stories/2011011450980400.htm|title=The King of Lanka|date=14 January 2011|publisher=''[[The Hindu]]''|accessdate=11 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received the [[Kendra Sahitya Academy Award]] in 1962 for ''Kanchana Sita''. It was later adapted into a [[Kanchana Sita|film with same name]] by [[G. Aravindan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; His another major work was ''Nashtakkachavadam'' which won the [[M. P. Paul]] prize.

Sreekantan Nair experimented successfully with stage direction and concepts of theatre.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/epic-moments/article3188727.ece&lt;/ref&gt; He has also written some short stories.

'''Canadian French''' ({{lang-fr|français canadien}}) refers to a variety of dialects of the [[French language]] generally spoken in Canada. In 2011, the total number of native French speakers in Canada was around 7.3 million (22% of the entire population), while another 2 million spoke it as a [[second language]]. At the [[Government of Canada|federal]] level, it has official status alongside [[Canadian English|English]]. At the [[Canadian Provinces|provincial]] level, French is the sole official language of [[Quebec]] as well as one of two official languages of [[New Brunswick]], and jointly official (derived from its federal legal status) in [[Nunavut]], [[Yukon]], and the [[Northwest Territories]]. Government services are offered in French at select localities in [[Manitoba]] and [[Ontario]] (through the [[French Language Services Act]]), and to a lesser extent elsewhere in the country, depending largely on the proximity to [[Quebec]] and/or Québécois influence on any given region.

[[New England French]], a dialect spoken in northern [[New England]] is essentially a variety of Canadian French and exhibits no particular differences from the Canadian dialects, unlike [[Louisiana French]] and [[Louisiana Creole]].&lt;ref name=Ammon&gt;{{cite book |title=Status and Function of Languages and Language Varieties |last= Ammon|first= Ulrich|authorlink= |author2=International Sociological Association|year= 1989|publisher= Walter de Gruyter|location= |isbn= 0-89925-356-3|pages= 306–308|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=geh261xgI8sC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=February 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Varieties==
''[[Quebec French]]'' is spoken in [[Quebec]]. Closely related varieties are spoken by francophone communities in [[Ontario]], [[Western Canada]] and the [[New England]] region of the United States, differing only from Quebec French primarily by their greater conservatism. The term ''Laurentian French'' has limited applications as a collective label for all these varieties, and ''Quebec French'' has also been used for the entire dialect group. The overwhelming majority of [[francophone]] Canadians speak this dialect.

''[[Acadian French]]'' is spoken by over 350,000 [[Acadians]] in parts of the [[Maritime Provinces]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], the [[Magdalen Islands]], the [[Côte-Nord|Lower North Shore]] and the [[Gaspé peninsula]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=CA Ethnologue report for Canada]&lt;/ref&gt; [[St. Marys Bay French|St. Mary's Bay French]] is a variety of Acadian French spoken in Nova Scotia.

''[[Métis French]]'' is spoken in [[Manitoba]] and [[Western Canada]] by the [[Métis in Canada|Métis]], descendants of [[First Nations]] mothers and [[voyageurs|voyageur]] fathers during the [[fur trade]]. Many Métis spoke [[Cree language|Cree]] in addition to French, and over the years they developed a unique mixed language called [[Michif language|Michif]] by combining Métis French nouns, numerals, articles and adjectives with Cree verbs, demonstratives, postpositions, interrogatives and pronouns. Both the Michif language and the Métis dialect of French are [[language death|severely endangered]].

''[[Newfoundland French]]'' is spoken by a small population on the [[Port au Port Peninsula|Port-au-Port Peninsula]] of [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]]. It is endangered — both Quebec French and Acadian French are now more widely spoken among Newfoundland francophones than the distinctive peninsular dialect.

''[[Brayon|Brayon French]]'' is spoken in the [[Beauce, Quebec|Beauce]] of Quebec; Edmundston, New Brunswick; and Madawaska, Maine. Although superficially a phonological descendant of Acadian French, analysis reveals it is [[morphosyntactic]]ally identical to Quebec French.&lt;ref&gt;Geddes, James (1908). ''Study of the Acadian-French language spoken on the north shore of the Baie-des-Chaleurs''. Halle: Niemeyer; Wittmann, Henri (1995) "Grammaire comparée des variétés coloniales du français populaire de Paris du 17&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; siècle et origines du français québécois." in Fournier, Robert &amp; Henri Wittmann. ''Le français des Amériques''. Trois-Rivières: Presses universitaires de Trois-Rivières, 281–334.[http://www.nou-la.org/ling/1995a-fda.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed to have resulted from a localized levelling of contact dialects between Québécois and Acadian settlers.

''[[New England French]]'' is spoken in parts of [[New England]] in the United States. Essentially a local variant of Quebec French, it is one of three major forms of French that developed in what is now the U.S., the others being [[Louisiana French]] and the nearly-extinct [[Missouri French]]. It is endangered, though its use is supported by bilingual education programs in place since 1987.&lt;ref name=Ammon/&gt;

===Sub-varieties===
There are two main sub-varieties of Canadian French. ''[[Joual]]'' is an informal variety of French spoken in working-class neighbourhoods in the province of Quebec. ''[[Chiac]]'' is a blending of Acadian French syntax and vocabulary with numerous lexical borrowings from English.

==Historical usage==
The term ''Canadian French'' was formerly used to refer specifically to Quebec French and the closely related varieties of Ontario and Western Canada descended from it.&lt;ref&gt;Francard and Latin, in ''Le régionalisme lexical'', write:
:"Le français du Québec a rayonné en Ontario et dans l'ouest du Canada, de même qu'en Nouvelle-Angleterre. [...] Le français québécois et le français acadien peuvent être regroupés sous l'appellation plus large de ''français canadien''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, laquelle englobe aussi le français ontarien et le français de l'Ouest canadien. Ces deux derniers possèdent des traits caractéristiques qui leur sont propres aujourd'hui dans l'ensemble canadien et qui s'expliquent surtout par un phénomène de conservatisme, mais il s'agit de variétés qui sont historiquement des prolongements du français québécois.
: &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Il faut noter ici que le terme de «français canadien» avait autrefois un sens plus restreint, désignant le français du Québec et les variétés qui s'y rattachent directement, d'où l'emploi à cette époque de «canadianisme» pour parler d'un trait caractéristique du français du Québec."&lt;/ref&gt; This is presumably because Canada and Acadia were distinct parts of New France, and also of British North America, until 1867. However, today the term ''Canadian French'' is not usually deemed to exclude Acadian French.

[[Phylogenetics|Phylogenetically]], Quebec French, Métis French and Brayon French are representatives of [[koiné language|koiné]] French in the Americas whereas Acadian French, Cajun French, and Newfoundland French are derivatives of non-koinesized local dialects in France.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Fournier &amp; Henri Wittmann. 1995. ''Le français des Amériques''. Trois-Rivières: Presses universitaires de Trois-Rivières.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Codices Latini Antiquiores''''' ("The More Ancient [[Latin language|Latin]] Manuscripts"), generally abbreviated ''CLA'', is a catalogue of all surviving [[manuscripts]] in Latin (whether [[codex|codices]] or [[scroll]]s) written before the 9th century. The complete title of the work is '''''Codices Latini Antiquiores:''''' '''A Paleographical Guide to Latin Manuscripts Prior to the Ninth Century'''. [[Elias Avery Lowe]] founded the project in 1929 and directed it himself until his death in 1969.

==Origin, contents and editions==
At the beginning of the 20th century, the history of Latin script was insufficiently known and based only on partial analyses. The need for a complete catalogue of early manuscripts, with an international character, was strongly felt in order to evaluate the differences in importance between the various cultural centres of book production, the transmission of ancient culture, and the creation of new [[Latin paleography|ways of writing]].

''CLA'' covers only literary works; this includes legal texts but not documentary texts such as charters. It comprises 11 volumes, organized according to the current location of the manuscripts. These were followed by a supplement in 1971 and two sets of addenda published in 1985 and 1992.
[[Paleography]] is the foundational principle of the project: every entry is accompanied by a photograph of the manuscript in black and white, in a 1:1 scale, along with a description of its contents, its state of preservation, the kind of writing used, and the possible date and geographical origin.

===Similar works===
Two similar projects have appeared: the first one for documentary texts from Antiquity and the [[Early Middle Ages]], under the title [[Chartae Latinae Antiquiores]] (''ChLA''). The second, under the title ''[[Manuscrits datés]]'', was directed under the auspices of the ''[[Comité international de paléographie latine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.palaeographia.org/cipl/cmd.htm Comité internationale de paléographie latine: current publications by country]&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike CLA and ChLA, it covers the entire medieval period, but is confined to manuscripts bearing a specific date or datable within a narrow period.

Other editorial projects stick to a more limited scope:
* Gamber, Klaus (1919–1989), ''Codices liturgici latini antiquiores'', Freiburg, Universitätsverlag, 1963; 2nd ed. 1968; suppl. and index, 1988.

===Reprint of 1988===
A reprint of ''CLA'' was carried out in 1988, though in a reduced format in comparison to the original.

==Author and collaborators==
''CLA'' is a major work for the understanding of the history of writing during [[Late Antiquity]] and the [[Early Middle Ages]]. The collection, representing the masterwork of [[Elias Avery Lowe]] during his activity at [[Princeton University]], had its roots in Lowe's doctoral thesis about the oldest calendars from [[Monte Cassino]] (1908) under the direction of [[Ludwig Traube (palaeographer)|Ludwig Traube]].

[[Roger Mynors|R. A. B. (Roger Aubrey Baskerville) Mynors]] (1903–1989), professor of Latin at [[Oxford University]] and editor, coauthored the last volumes. 

The German [[palaeographer]] [[Bernhard Bischoff]] worked on ''CLA'' starting from 1933, and is responsible for many of the descriptions. He subsequently embarked on a comparable catalogue of ninth-century continental manuscripts which remained unfinished at his death; two volumes have since appeared, covering libraries alphabetically from Aachen to Paderborn.

==Historical Information and Statistics==
[[File:cla1.jpg|thumb|alt=CLA Statistiques : Contenu|''CLA'' statistics: Contents]]
[[File:clao.png|thumb|alt=CLA Statistiques : Provenance|''CLA'' statistics: Provenance]]
[[File:cla-mig.jpg|thumb|alt=CLA statistics on manuscript displacements: provenance by date and place of conservation]]
[[File:cla-migt.png|thumb|alt=CLA statistics on manuscript displacements: model of both production and displacement according to content]]

With the various supplements, the ''CLA'' comprise 18,884 codices or scrolls and more than 2,000 works, including a great number of fragments. Before the mid 4th century, only fragmentary scraps of literary texts and ancient classics survive; afterwards, until 800, most works are of a theological character. The copying and production of texts of secular interest stopped almost completely around the 6th and 7th centuries.

The facts found about Italy are remarkable in particular. Between 400 and 800, the production of books is constant, and the number of surviving works grows over time. These Italian works, most of which are of theological interest, were exported to all of Europe until such places started a production of books of their own. In [[France]], this only occurs in the mid 8th century; in [[England]] and [[Ireland]], around 730; in Germany and [[Switzerland]], around 800. From the 5th century to the 7th century, the most important movement of books goes from Italy to France. During the 8th century, the transportation of manuscripts from France and the Anglo-Saxon domains (Ireland and England) towards the continent is a cultural and historical phenomenon of great importance.

However, such statistics can't be determined for classical pagan works, which were apparently displaced more recently.

The '''contemporary realism''' movement&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artcyclopedia.com/history/contemporary-realism.html|title=Contemporary Realism|website=www.artcyclopedia.com|access-date=2017-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[North America]]n style of painting which came into existence c. 1960s and early 1970s. Featuring a straightforward  approach to representation practiced by artists such as [[Philip Pearlstein]], [[Alex Katz]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artnet.com/artists/alex-katz/|title=Alex Katz {{!}} artnet|website=www.artnet.com|access-date=2017-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jack Beal]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-02-27|title=Jack Beal|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jack_Beal&amp;oldid=767666756|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Neil Welliver]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-02-19|title=Neil Welliver|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neil_Welliver&amp;oldid=766314373|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement refers to figurative art works created in a natural yet highly objective style.  Today the term Contemporary Realism encompasses all post-1970 sculptors and painters whose discipline is representational art, where the object is to portray the "real" and not the "ideal".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/history-of-art/realism.htm|title=Realism Art Movement: History, Characteristics of Naturalism|website=www.visual-arts-cork.com|access-date=2017-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Contemporary Realists, like Beal and [[Rackstraw Downes]], began as trained abstract painters. (Abstract Expressionism had been well-established by c. 1960.) Rural artist enclaves (e.g., The Hamptons; areas of Maine) encouraged naturalistic imagery for some. Others shared approaches and methods of [[Photorealism]].  Some art schools, notably the [[Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts]], have continued to nurture the legacy of 19th-century American Realist painting; Yale has seen a loose, inter-generational network of representational painters over the past few decades. The [[New York Academy of Art]] continues to further contemporary figurative art.  A number of women artists have been prominently associated with stylistic variants of '''contemporary realism,''' including (not limited to) [[Jane Freilicher]], [[Jane Wilson]], [[Lois Dodd]], [[Janet Fish]], [[Catherine Murphy (artist)|Catherine Murphy]], [[Yvonne Jacquette]] and [[Martha Mayer Erlebacher]]. {{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

{{main|Kinship}}

'''Crow kinship''' is a [[Kinship and descent|kinship]] system used to define [[family]]. Identified by [[Lewis Henry Morgan]] in his 1871 work ''Systems of Consanguinity and Affinity of the Human Family'', the Crow system is one of the six major kinship systems ([[Eskimo kinship|Eskimo]], [[Hawaiian kinship|Hawaiian]], [[Iroquois kinship|Iroquois]], Crow, [[Omaha kinship|Omaha]], and [[Sudanese kinship|Sudanese]]).{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

==Kinship system==
The system is somewhat similar to the [[Iroquois kinship|Iroquois system]], but distinguishes between the mother's side and the father's side. Relatives on the mother's side of the family have more descriptive terms, and relatives on the father's side have more classificatory terms.

The Crow system is distinctive because unlike most other kinship systems, it chooses not to distinguish between certain generations.  The relatives of the subject's father's matrilineage are distinguished only by their sex, regardless of their age or generation.  In contrast, within Ego's own matrilineage, differences of generation are noted.  The system is associated with groups that have a strong tradition of [[Matrilineality|matrilineal descent]].  In doing so, the system is almost a mirror image of the [[Omaha kinship|Omaha system]], which is [[patrilineal]].

As with the Iroquois system, the Crow uses bifurcate merging, meaning that there is a distinction between collateral relatives of different gender in Ego's descent group. In this case, father's brother would be called "father's brother", and mother's brother would be called "uncle".&lt;ref&gt;Murdock, George Peter. "Bifurcate Merging, a Test of Five Theories." American anthropologist 49.1 (1947): 56-68.&lt;/ref&gt;  Only the [[Iroquois kinship|Iroquois system]] uses BM as a secondary name.
[[Image:Crow-kinship-chart.png|center|700px|Graphic of the Crow kinship system]]

==Usage==
The system is named for the [[Crow Tribe]] of [[Montana]].  The system appears frequently among various cultures.  In the Southwestern US, it has traditionally been part of the [[Hopi|Hopi Indian]] culture and the [[Navajo Nation]].

'''Dr. D.J. (David James) Davies''' (2 June 1893 – 11 October 1956), was a [[Welsh people|Welsh]] economist,&lt;ref name="Davies' biography"&gt;National Library of Wales, [http://yba.llgc.org.uk/en/s2-DAVI-JAM-1893.html Welsh Biography Online], extracted 16 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt; [[industrialist]],&lt;ref name="Cambria Magazine"&gt;''Why Not a Welsh Royal Family? by Siôn T Jobbins, January 2008, Cambria magazine&lt;/ref&gt; prize winning essayist,&lt;ref name="Davies' biography"/&gt; author,&lt;ref name="Davies' biography"/&gt; political activist, pilot,&lt;ref name="Cambria Magazine"/&gt; and an [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalist]].&lt;ref name="Davies' biography"/&gt; Davies was a world traveller before returning home to Wales.

Initially a founding member of the [[Welsh Labour Party]] in the [[Ammanford]] district, in 1925 he left Labour becoming a founding member of [[Plaid Cymru]], the [[Welsh nationalism|nationalist]] party of [[Wales]].&lt;ref name="Davies' biography"/&gt;

According to historian Professor [[John Davies (historian)|John Davies]], it was D.J. Davies' ideas which were more influential in shaping long-term Plaid Cymru ideology following the [[Second World War]], and Davies was as "equally [a] significant figure" as [[Saunders Lewis]] in [[Welsh nationalism]] history, but it was Lewis' "brilliance and charismatic appeal" which was firmly associated with Plaid Genedlaethol Cymru of the 1930s.&lt;ref name="Cambria Magazine"/&gt;&lt;ref name="A History of Wales"&gt;John Davies, ''A History of Wales'', Pages 591, 592&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wales and America"&gt;John Davies, ''Wales and America''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
D.J. Davies was born the third child of Thomas Davies, a miner, and Ellen Davies (née Williams) in Carmel, [[Carmarthenshire]], Wales, on 2 June 1893.&lt;ref name="Davies' biography"/&gt; After attending local schools, Davies began [[Child labour|working at age 14]] in several [[collieries]] and at [[Barry Docks]].&lt;ref name="Davies' biography"/&gt; Though working long hours, Davies continued his education by taking evening classes and through correspondence courses.&lt;ref name="Davies' biography"/&gt;

==World traveller==
In 1912 Davies emigrated to Canada and then to the United States where he worked in mines.&lt;ref name="Davies' biography"/&gt; Davies was a co-founder of the [[Northwestern Coal and Coke Company]] in [[Steamboat Springs, Colorado|Steamboat Springs]], [[Colorado]]. "A colourful figure," wrote professor John Davies, D.J. Davies travelled throughout the United States, became a [[Boxing|boxer]], attended [[Colorado State University-Pueblo]], and then studied law at [[Seattle University]] in [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]].&lt;ref name="Davies' biography"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cambria Magazine"/&gt;&lt;ref name="A History of Wales"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wales and America"/&gt;

Following his studies, Davies travelled to Asia, spending time in Japan and China before returning to the US and joining the [[United States Navy]] as an engineer and pilot in 1918.&lt;ref name="Davies' biography"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cambria Magazine"/&gt; Davies' membership in the [[US military]], rather than the [[British military]], was "a protest against the class bound attitudes of the officers of the [[British Army]]," according to professor John Davies.&lt;ref name="Wales and America"/&gt;

While [[Leave (U.S. military)|on leave]] from the US Navy in 1919, Davies returned to Wales and worked as a collier in [[Llandybïe]], until he was seriously injured in an accident.&lt;ref name="Davies' biography"/&gt; By 1920 Davies was discharged from the US Navy following his incapacitation the following year.&lt;ref name="Davies' biography"/&gt;

==Political activist==
During his "enforced leisure" resulting from the accident, wrote Dr. Ceinwen Hannah Thomas, Davies studied "economics, politics and the history of the Working Class Movement".&lt;ref name="Davies' biography"/&gt; Stirred into socialist political activism, Davies became a founding member of the [[Labour Party (United Kingdom)|Labour Party]] in the [[Ammanford]] district of [[Carmarthenshire]].&lt;ref name="Davies' biography"/&gt;

In 1924 Davies travelled to [[Denmark]] to attend the [[International People's College]] in [[Elsinore]], and a [[Folk High School]] in [[Vestbirk]], where "[Davies'] attitude towards the relationship between socialism and nationalism changed completely", according to Dr. Thomas.&lt;ref name="Davies' biography"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"[Davies] came to believe that true internationalism was based on co-operation between free nations, while the advancement of the Welsh working class could only be secured in a free Wales. This point of view was expressed months before the Welsh Nationalist Party (now Plaid Cymru) was founded in 1925, while he was unaware of the existence of a nationalist movement in Wales. He returned from Denmark a convinced nationalist in favour of an economic policy of co-operation which placed ownership and control of the means of production in the hands of the workers themselves".- Dr. Ceinwen Hannah Thomas&lt;ref name="Davies' biography"/&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Of Davies' experience in [[Denmark]], author Siôn T. Jobbins wrote "Impressed by that little country's ability to govern itself, the one-time member of the Independent Labour Party returned to [[Wales]] in 1924 a Welsh nationalist".

Inspired by the Folk High Schools of Denmark, Davies and his new Irish bride Noëlle Ffrench, whom he had met at the International People's College, moved to Ireland to establish a Folk High School there.&lt;ref name="Davies' biography"/&gt;

However, by 1925 their attempt proved unsuccessful, and the couple moved to [[Aberystwyth]] where Davies attended the [[Aberystwyth University]], then known as University College of Wales (U.C.W.).&lt;ref name="Davies' biography"/&gt; Also that year, Davies resigned from the Labour Party and became a founding member of the newly formed ''Plaid Genedlaethol Cymru'', later known as [[Plaid Cymru|Plaid Cymru; the Party of Wales]].

Davies graduated from U.C.W., Aberystwyth, with his Bachelor of Arts in economics in 1928, a [[Master of Arts]] in 1930, and a Doctor of Philosophy in 1931.&lt;ref name="Davies' biography"/&gt; Davies won consecutive awards at the [[National Eisteddfod of Wales]] in 1930, 1931, 1932, and 1934 on essays on economics and politics.&lt;ref name="Davies' biography"/&gt; Davies' economic essays were particularly inspired by US President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]], "and year in year out the model he offered for the regeneration of depression-ridden Wales was the work of the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]]", according to Dr. Davies.&lt;ref name="Wales and America"/&gt;

In 1932, Davies and his wife again attempted to establish a Folk School in the Danish tradition, and bought the Pantybeilïau mansion at [[Gilwern]] in Monmouthshire.&lt;ref name="Gilwern"/&gt; However this attempt also proved ultimately unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="Davies' biography"/&gt;

Davies increased his participation within Plaid Cymru, contributing as an economic and political researcher, author of pamphlets and articles in the movement's publications, as well as writing articles in other mainstream Welsh and English language publications.&lt;ref name="Davies' biography"/&gt;

However Davies and other [[political left|leftest]] members of Plaid Cymru were increasingly disaffected by Plaid president Saunders Lewis.&lt;ref name="A History of Wales"/&gt; Davies objected to Lewis' economic policies, Lewis' rejection of capitalism and socialism, and at the party conference in 1938, Davies and other leftest members firmly rejected Lewis' concept of "perchentyaeth"; a policy of 'distributing property among the masses'.&lt;ref name="A History of Wales"/&gt; Additionally, Davies and many leftest Plaid members were deeply offended by the "readiness of prominent party members [such as Lewis] to see virtue in Mussolini and Franco".&lt;ref name="A History of Wales"/&gt; In 1939 Lewis resigned as Plaid Cymru president citing that Wales was not ready to accept the leadership of a [[Roman Catholic]].&lt;ref name="A History of Wales"/&gt;

Davies argued in favour of engaging English-speaking Welsh communities, and stressed the territorial integrity of Wales. Davies pointed towards [[Scandinavia]]n countries as a model to emulate, and was active in the economic implications of Welsh self-government.&lt;ref name="A History of Wales"/&gt;

In 1953, one-time [[republicanism in the United Kingdom|republican]] Davies wrote an article in ''Y Fanar'' publication strongly endorsing a Welsh [[constitutional monarch]].&lt;ref name="Cambria Magazine"/&gt; Posthumously published in English in his book ''Towards Welsh Freedom'' in 1958, Davies advocated that an independent Wales would be better served by a Welsh constitutional monarchy, one which would engender the affection and allegiance of the Welsh people and legitimise Welsh sovereignty.&lt;ref name="Cambria Magazine"/&gt;

An hereditary [[constitutional monarch]] would, he argued, embody and personify a Welsh national identity above party politics, while political parties formed governments in a [[parliamentary system]] similar to those of Denmark, [[Norway]], or the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref name="Cambria Magazine"/&gt; Davies advocated for the elevation of a native [[Welsh peers and baronets|Welsh gentry family]], rather than inviting a foreign prince to the throne of Wales.&lt;ref name="Cambria Magazine"/&gt; Among the criteria for consideration, argued Davies, was that the family had to have a history of contributing to Welsh life and reside in Wales.&lt;ref name="Cambria Magazine"/&gt;

In the 1950s, Davies and his wife Noëlle became deeply concerned over the dispute concerning the legal status of [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]], which some considered part of Wales while others considered part of England. "They lost no opportunity in demonstrating that it had always been an integral part of Wales," wrote Dr.Thomas.&lt;ref name="Davies' biography"/&gt;

==Death==
D.J. Davies died on 11 October 1956 and was buried in Carmel graveyard in [[Carmarthenshire]].&lt;ref name="Davies' biography"/&gt;

'''Daza''' (also known as '''Dazaga''') is a [[Nilo-Saharan language]] spoken by the [[Daza people]] inhabiting northern [[Chad]]. The Daza are also known as the [[Gouran]] (Gorane) in Chad.&lt;ref name=e18/&gt; Dazaga is spoken by around 380,000 people, primarily in the [[Djurab Desert]] region and the [[Borkou]] region, locally called Haya or [[Faya-Largeau]] northern-central Chad, the capital of the Dazaga people. Dazaga is spoken in the [[Tibesti Mountains]] of [[Chad]] (330,000 speakers), in the eastern [[Niger]] near [[N'guigmi]] and to the north (50,000 speakers). It is also spoken to a smaller extent in [[Libya]] and in [[Sudan]], where there is a community of 3,000 speakers in the city of [[Omdurman]]. There's also a small diaspora community working in [[Jeddah]], [[Saudi Arabia]].

The two primary dialects of the Dazaga language are Daza and Kara, but there are several other mutually intelligible dialects, including Kaga, Kanobo, Taruge and Azza. It is closely related to the [[Tedaga language]], spoken by the [[Teda people|Teda]], the other out of the two [[Toubou people]] groups, who reside primarily in the Tibesti Mountains of northern Chad and in southern Libya near the city of [[Sabha, Libya|Sabha]].

Dazaga is a Nilo-Saharan language and a member of the Western Saharan branch of the [[Saharan languages|Saharan]] subgroup which also contains the [[Kanuri language]], [[Kanembu language]] and [[Tebu languages]].&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, Joseph H. 1963. The languages of Africa. International Journal of American Linguistics 29.1. Repr. The Hague: Mouton, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; Tebu is further divided into Tedaga and Dazaga. The Eastern Saharan branch includes the [[Zaghawa language]] and [[Berti language]].&lt;ref&gt;Cyffer, Norbert. 2000. Linguistic properties of the Saharan languages. Areal and Genetic Factors in Language Classification and Description: Africa South of the Sahara, ed. by Petr Zima, 30-59. Lincom Studies in African Linguistics 47. München: Lincom Europa&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vocabulary==
The dialects spoken in Chad and Niger have some [[French language|French]] influence whereas the dialects spoken in Libya and Sudan have more of an [[Arabic]] influence. The Dazaga language is not a [[literary language]] and has a limited vocabulary. It adjusts to this by borrowing from other languages such as Arabic or French. For example, the word for "thank you" did not exist in Dazaga so the Arabic word ''shokran'' was incorporated into the language and is usually followed by the suffix ''-num'' which acknowledges the second person. The majority of Dazaga speakers are [[bilingual]] in their native tongue along with either Arabic, French, Zaghawa, [[Hausa language|Hausa]], [[Zarma language|Zarma]], Kanuri or [[Tuareg languages|Tuareg]].&lt;br /&gt;The following tables contain words from the Daza dialect spoken in Omdurman, Sudan. This [[romanisation]] is not standard.

'''Dramatic Interpretation''' (often shortened to "Dramatic Interp," "Drama" or just "DI") is an event in [[National Speech and Debate Association]] (and NSDA-related) high school forensics competitions. In the [[National Christian Forensics and Communications Association]] the event is combined with [[Humorous Interpretation]] to create the Dramatic Performance event.  It consists of a piece from any published work, edited to fit within a 10-minute span with a 30-second grace period (it does not have a minimum and cannot be above 10:30).&lt;ref&gt;High School Unified Manual: Chapter, Rules, and Tournament Operations. 2017 ed. Vol. 1.0. National Speech and Debate Association, 2017. PDF. Updated February 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

In a typical round of DI, five to seven performers will each perform a "cutting" (excerpt) from a readily available, published (copyrighted or non-copyrighted) play, novel, or short story. As the name suggests, the cuttings are invariably  from non-comedic (e.g., dramatic) works. Some performers select monologues, others may adopt the roles of many different characters, changing their tone, manner, and the position of their body to indicate a change in character.

After all of the competitors have performed, the judge (or judges) in the round will rank them from best to worst, and assign each of them a [[National Forensic League Points|score]].  Contestants who score well will "break" out of preliminary rounds and continue to advance through octo/quarter/semi/final rounds if they continue to score well.

== NSDA Nationals ==

[[National Speech and Debate Association]] Nationals was hosted in [[Salt Lake City, Utah]] in 2016. National Champions are awarded a scholarship of US$1,000. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.speechanddebate.org/nationals-history/&lt;/ref&gt; To receive the title a competitor must have the lowest cumulative score throughout the duration of the tournament. The Dramatic Interpretation competitor to receive the lowest cumulative score in the final round is awarded the BAMA Bowl and a US$500 [[scholarship]].&lt;ref&gt;https://ci.uky.edu/toc/sites/default/files/NSDA%20Event%20Rulebook%202014.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Speech and Debate Association]] (NSDA) National Tournament is the largest academic competition in the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://fox4kc.com/2014/06/17/blue-valley-west-hosts-worlds-largest-academic-competition/&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://live-timely-itszka97ct.time.ly/event/national-speech-debate-associations-national-championships-largest-academic-competition-in-the-world/?instance_id=903&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.kshb.com/news/local-news/kansas-city-hosts-largest-academic-competition-in-the-world&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rules ==

Dramatic Interpretation falls under the jurisdiction of events under the category defined as “Interpretation” by the [[National Speech and Debate Association]] (NSDA). These events are [[Humorous Interpretation]], [[Duo Interpretation]], and [[Program Oral Interpretation]]. Events that do not fall under the jurisdiction of the following rules include, but are not limited to: Poetry, Prose, and Storytelling. The [[National Speech and Debate Association]]s rules are organized into categories of length, material, material availability, performance, re-use, and website approval submission process. &lt;ref&gt;High School Unified Manual: Chapter, Rules, and Tournament Operations. 2017 ed. Vol. 1.0. National Speech and Debate Association, 2017. PDF. Updated February 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Length ===
The set time limit is ten minutes with a thirty-second period in which a student may go overtime with no penalty, colloquially referred to as a 'grace period.'According to [[National Speech and Debate Association]] rules, a student who exceeds the ten minute and thirty second time limit cannot be awarded the rank of 1st in the round. There is no minimum time limit. &lt;ref&gt;High School Unified Manual: Chapter, Rules, and Tournament Operations. 2017 ed. Vol. 1.0. National Speech and Debate Association, 2017. PDF. Updated February 2017 pg 43-44. &lt;/ref&gt;

=== Material and material availability ===
Student may chose from a single work of literature to perform. 
Acceptable forms of literature include: &lt;ref&gt;High School Unified Manual: Chapter, Rules, and Tournament Operations. 2017 ed. Vol. 1.0. National Speech and Debate Association, 2017. PDF. Updated February 2017 pg 43-44. &lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Novels]]
* [[Play (theatre)|Play]]s
* [[Anthologies]] where only one piece of literature is performed
* [[Poetry]]
* [[Song lyrics]]

=== Performance ===
In Dramatic Interpretation, Duo Interpretation, and Humorous Interpretation performers are not permitted to use any type of "physical objects or costuming."&lt;ref&gt;High School Unified Manual: Chapter, Rules, and Tournament Operations. 2017 ed. Vol. 1.0. National Speech and Debate Association, 2017. PDF. Updated February 2017 pg 45. &lt;/ref&gt; 
In addition students may not: 
* Adapt material for purposes other than transitional. Controversially, sub-point 5.A under Interpretations on the [[National Speech and Debate Association]] Manual has been used to disqualify national finalist and national champions during and after the final round at [[National Speech and Debate Association]] Nationals. (See [[Humorous Interpretation]] (Contestant H208))
* Rely on the use of scripts.

=== Re-use ===
Students may not perform the same work of literature at any [[National Speech and Debate Association]] tournament if they have already done so in a separate contestant year. 

=== Website approval submission process ===
All piece selection are subject to online year-round review. 

== College Dramatic Interpretation ==
In college, DI cuttings must be from a play. Novels and short stories are used in prose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Drama Interpretation|url=http://www.blinn.edu/brazos/humanities/writingcenter/Handouts/Drama%20Interpretation.pdf|publisher=Blinn Colledge-Bryan writing center|accessdate=10 July 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921055811/http://www.blinn.edu/brazos/humanities/writingcenter/Handouts/Drama%20Interpretation.pdf|archivedate=21 September 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; College competitors in the event are discouraged from singing and are allowed to select exclusively from published [[Play (theatre)|plays]]. Creating a Dramatic Interpretation from multiple plays is allowed if the aggregate product is of one cohesive theme. &lt;ref&gt;https://gustavus.edu/forensics/events/di.php&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
The realism is derived from real word. This school emerged in the nineteenth century. The realism is based on realism and the subject was made in contemporary society. The emergence factors of This school include :

1. The not-so-famous writers and artists who lived in the Latin Quarter of Paris and made a mock of romantics.

2. [[Barbizon]] School painters of the [[Italy|Italian]] classical tradition that was common at that time, Considered obsolete. And called for direct observation of nature. And reacted against the romantices reality escape.

==The realism elementary==

This type of realism begins with the works of [[Honoré de Balzac|Balzac]]. Elementary realism is committed itself to renewal accurate, complete and honestly social environment and the contemporary world, But this renewal is very simple and a pattern is not offered. In addition, Elementary realism is pessimistic and disappointed about the future. Works that were written in this school include, [[War and Peace]] by [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]], [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]'s [[Crime and Punishment]] and [[The Brothers Karamazov]] . [[Cape|Cape short story]] written by [[Nikolai Gogol]] as a fine example for elementary realism.

'''Export of revolution''' is actions by a victorious [[revolution]]ary [[government]] of one country to promote similar revolutions in unruled areas or other countries, as a manifestation of revolutionary [[internationalism (politics)|internationalism]] of certain kind, e.g., the [[Marxist]] [[proletarian internationalism]].&lt;ref name=halliday&gt;"Revolution and World Politics", by [[Fred Halliday]] (1999) {{ISBN|0-8223-2464-4}}, [https://www.google.com/books?id=3jCkXQRhHMgC&amp;pg=PA94&amp;dq=%22export+of+revolution%22#PPA94,M1 "Internationalism in Practice: Export of Revolution" pp. 94&amp;ndash;132]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fred Halliday]]&lt;ref name=halliday/&gt; analyzes the traits of the export of revolution by case studies of [[French Revolution]], [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]]/[[Soviet Union]], [[People's Republic of China]], [[Cuba]] of [[Fidel Castro]], and [[Iran]] of [[Ayatollah Khomeini]].

It refers to ensuring successful and economical flow of [[hydrocarbon]] stream from [[reservoir]] to the point of sale. The term was coined by [[Petrobras]] in the early 1990s in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] as ''Garantia do Escoamento''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ep.total.com/en/areas/deep-offshore/flow-assurance-sensitive-issue-any-oil-development-project&lt;/ref&gt; ([[:pt::Garantia do Escoamento]]), meaning literally “Guarantee of Flow”, or Flow Assurance.

Flow assurance is extremely diverse, encompassing many discrete and specialized subjects and bridging across the full gamut of [[engineering]] disciplines. Besides [[network modeling]] and transient [[multiphase flow|multiphase]] simulation, flow assurance involves effectively handling many solid deposits, such as, gas hydrates,&lt;ref&gt;http://hydrates.white.prohosting.com/&lt;/ref&gt; [[asphaltene]], [[paraffin wax#Wax|wax]], scale, and [[naphthenate]]s. Flow assurance is the most critical task during deep water [[energy production]] because of the high pressures and low temperature (~4 degree Celsius) involved. The financial loss from production interruption or asset damage due to flow assurance mishap can be astronomical. What compounds the flow assurance task even further is that these solid deposits can interact with each other,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Investigation of Interactions between Gas Hydrates and Several Other Flow Assurance Elements | author = Shuqiang Gao | journal = Energy Fuels | year = 2008 | volume = 22 | issue = 5 | pages = 3150–3153 | doi = 10.1021/ef800189k}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can cause catastrophic blockage formation in [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]] and result in flow assurance failure. 

Flow assurance includes thermal investigation of pipelines, making sure the temperature is above the hydrate's formation temperature. Another important aspect of flow assurance is evaluation of erosion due to sand and corrosion in pipelines and equipment.

'''Gaya''' (伽耶語, 가야어), also rendered '''Kaya''' or '''Karak''', is the presumed language of the [[Gaya confederacy]] in southern [[Korea]]. It is supposedly attested from thirteen [[toponym]]s, but it cannot be certain that these reflect the Gaya language itself rather than an earlier language.&lt;ref name="koguryo"&gt;{{cite book |first=Christopher |last=Beckwith |year=2007 |title=Koguryo, the Language of Japan's Continental Relatives |pages=27–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only one word survives that is directly identified as being from the language of the Gaya confederacy.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

==Identity==
The place names in question appear to be in a language related to [[Korean language|Korean]] and [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. [[Christopher I. Beckwith|Beckwith]] classifies the [[Japonic languages|Japonic]] family with toponymic pre-Kara as follows:&lt;ref name="koguryo"/&gt;
The linguistic scholar from South Korea, Jung Ho Wan, claimed that while it is only an assumption to say that Gaya's language, which is the only one left to this day, is similar to Japanese language, if the assumption is true, however, this suggests that not only Gaya's culture but also its language influenced the Yayoi who crossed over from the Korean Peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;가야의 언어와 문화 2007년 06월 27일 출간 &lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Japonic languages|Japonic]]
**[[Yayoi language|Yayoi]]
***[[Japanese dialects|Japanese]]
***Pre-Kara &lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;
**[[Ryukyuan languages|Ryukyuan]]
It is not clear if this "pre-Kara" was related to the language of the later Gaya confederacy, of which only four words survive.&lt;ref name="Beckwith" /&gt; In volume 34 of the ''[[Samguk Sagi]]'', a note for the word 旃檀梁 states that, "In the Kaya language, 'gate' is called 梁." The Chinese character {{angle bracket|梁}} was used to write the [[Sillan language|Silla]] word for 'ridge', which was ancestral to Middle Korean 돌 ''*twol'' 'ridge', suggesting that the Gaya word for 'gate' may have been pronounced something like ''twol''.

==Name==
The name ''Gaya'' is Korean, from the modern transcription 加耶 (伽倻). However, it was difficult to render the [[phonology|phonological shape]] of words in the languages of Korea by the use of Chinese characters, since [[Hangul]] had not yet been invented, and thus a variety of historical forms are attested. (See [[Gaya confederacy#Names|Gaya confederacy]].) Generally ''Gaya'' was transcribed as ''Kaya'' (加耶) or ''Karak'' (伽落), but the transcription in the oldest sources is ''Kara'' (加羅), and philological reconstruction points towards [[Middle Chinese|MC]] *kayia, from Ancient Chinese *kala = *kara.&lt;ref name="koguryo"/&gt; [[Christopher I.

'''Hamont dialect''' or '''Hamont Limburgish''' is the [[dialect|city dialect]] and variant of [[Limburgish language|Limburgish]] spoken in the [[Belgium|Belgian]] city of Hamont (a part of [[Hamont-Achel]]) alongside the [[Dutch language]] (with which it is not mutually intelligible).{{sfnp|Verhoeven|2007|p=219}} In the Achel part of Hamont-Achel, another dialect called [[Achels]] is spoken.

===Vowels===
The Hamont dialect contains 22 monophthong and 13 diphthong phonemes.{{sfnp|Verhoeven|2007|p=221}} The amount of monophthongs is higher than that of consonants.{{sfnp|Verhoeven|2007|p=221}}

On average, long vowels are 95 ms longer than short vowels. This is very similar to Belgian Standard Dutch, in which the difference is 105 ms.{{sfnp|Verhoeven|2007|p=220}}{{sfnp|Verhoeven|Van Bael|2002}}

The quality of the monophthongs is as follows:
* {{IPA|/i, iː, yː, u, uː, eː, øː, oː, ɛ, ɛː, œ, œː, ɔ, ɔː, ɑː/}} are similar to the corresponding cardinal vowels {{IPA|[{{IPA link|i}}, {{IPA link|y}}, {{IPA link|u}}, {{IPA link|e}}, {{IPA link|ø}}, {{IPA link|o}}, {{IPA link|ɛ}}, {{IPA link|œ}}, {{IPA link|ɔ}}, {{IPA link|ɑ}}]}}, but none of them are quite as peripheral.{{sfnp|Verhoeven|2007|p=221}}
* {{IPA|/y/}} is [[mid-centralized]] in relation to the long {{IPA|/yː/}} (this is not shown on the vowel chart). It can be described as near-close advanced central {{IPAblink|ʉ̞|ʉ̞˖}}.{{sfnp|Verhoeven|2007|pp=221, 223}}
* {{IPA|/ɪ/}} is similar to {{IPA|/eː/}}, but it is lower and slightly more central ({{IPAblink|ɪ|ɪ̞}}). For some speakers there is additional non-phonemic long {{IPAblink|ɪː}}, which can appear in words such as ''noordenw'''i'''nd'' {{IPA|[ˈnoːʀdəʀβɪːnt]}} ('north wind'). This is probably an influence of Belgian Standard Dutch.{{sfnp|Verhoeven|2007|pp=221, 224}}
* {{IPA|/ʏ/}}, a phonological front vowel, is phonetically central {{IPAblink|ɵ}}. As in Standard Dutch, it can be considered to be a stressed equivalent of {{IPA|/ə/}} as they differ mainly in rounding.{{sfnp|Verhoeven|2007|pp=220–221}}
* The contrast between the long open vowels is a genuine front–central–back contrast. The Hamont dialect thus has four, not five phonemic vowel heights.{{sfnp|Verhoeven|2007|pp=221–222}}
* {{IPA|/æː/}} is open front {{IPAblink|æ̞ː}}, whereas {{IPA|/aː/}} is open central {{IPAblink|äː}}.{{sfnp|Verhoeven|2007|p=221}}
* The short {{IPA|/æ/}} and {{IPA|/ɑ/}} are somewhat higher and more front ({{IPA|[{{IPA link|æ}}, {{IPA link|ɑ|ɑ̝̈}}]}}) than their long counterparts. This is not shown on the vowel chart.{{sfnp|Verhoeven|2007|p=221}}

====Monophthong-glide combinations====

All monophthong-glide combinations are restricted to the [[Syllable#Coda|syllable coda]].{{sfnp|Verhoeven|2007|p=222}}

====Diphthongs====
Dialect of Hamont contrasts long and short closing diphthongs. The long ones are on average 70 ms longer than their short equivalents. Centering diphthongs are all long.{{sfnp|Verhoeven|2007|p=221}}

* The starting point of {{IPA|/ɑu(ː)/}} is near-open central {{IPAblink|ɐ}}.{{sfnp|Verhoeven|2007|p=221}}
* The ending points of {{IPA|/ɛi(ː), œy(ː), ɔu(ː)/}} are rather close, more like {{IPA|[{{IPA link|i}}, {{IPA link|y}}, {{IPA link|u}}]}} than {{IPA|[{{IPA link|ɪ}}, {{IPA link|ʏ}}, {{IPA link|ʊ}}]}}.{{sfnp|Verhoeven|2007|p=221}}
* The ending point of {{IPA|/ɑu(ː)/}} is slightly more open ({{IPAblink|ʊ}}) than those of the other closing diphthongs.{{sfnp|Verhoeven|2007|p=221}}
* The starting points of {{IPA|/ɔu(ː)/}} and {{IPA|/oːə/}} are more central than the corresponding cardinal vowels: {{IPA|[{{IPA link|ɔ|ɔ̟}}, {{IPA link|o|o̟}}]}}.{{sfnp|Verhoeven|2007|p=221}}
* The starting points of {{IPA|/iːə, yːə/}} are somewhat lower ({{IPA|[{{IPA link|i|i̞}}, {{IPA link|y|y˕}}]}}) than the corresponding cardinal vowels.{{sfnp|Verhoeven|2007|p=221}}

===Prosody===
Like most other Limburgish dialects, but unlike some other dialects in this area,{{sfnp|Schouten|Peeters|1996}}{{sfnp|Heijmans|Gussenhoven|1998|p=111}} the prosody of the Hamont dialect has a lexical tone distinction, which is traditionally referred to as ''stoottoon'' ('push tone') or ''Accent 1'' and ''sleeptoon'' ('dragging tone') or ''Accent 2''. They are transcribed as superscript 1 and superscript 2, respectively. This distinction can signal either lexical differences or grammatical distinctions, such as those between the singular and the plural forms of some nouns.{{sfnp|Verhoeven|2007|p=223}}

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"

|}

The distinction between Accent 1 and Accent 2 is phonemic only in stressed syllables.{{sfnp|Verhoeven|2007|p=223}}

In final position, Accent 1 is realised as a steady fall {{IPA|[V˥˩]}} through the rhyme, the Accent 2 is falling-rising {{IPA|[V˥˩˩˥]}}; the first half of the rhyme is falling, whereas the rest is rising.{{sfnp|Verhoeven|2007|p=223}}

In non-final position, Accent 1's F0 stays high in the first 45% of the rhyme and then falls rapidly towards the end of the rhyme (in IPA, that can be transcribed {{IPA|[V˦˥]}}). When the focus of the sentence is on a word with Accent 2, it is realized as a very shallow fall-rise combination {{IPA|[V˥˩˩˥]}}.{{sfnp|Verhoeven|2007|p=224}}

Vowels with Accent 1 are generally shorter than those with Accent 2.{{sfnp|Verhoeven|2007|p=224}}

===Sample===
The sample text is a reading of the first sentence of [[The North Wind and the Sun]], read by a 75-year-old male middle-class speaker.{{sfnp|Verhoeven|2007|p=219}}

Note that the author transcribes ''de'' as *{{IPA|[de]}}, rather than the correct {{IPA|[də]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Orthographic version (Standard Belgian Dutch)====
De noordenwind en de zon waren ruzie aan het maken over wie het sterkste was toen er een man voorbij kwam met een warme jas aan.{{sfnp|Verhoeven|2007|p=225}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10945">[[Image:Scross helmsman.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The bridge of the freighter shown here has two steering stands. This redundancy is a safety measure in case one of the steering mechanisms that control the ship's rudder fails.]]

A '''helmsman''' or '''helm''' is a person who [[navigation|steers]] a [[ship]], [[sailboat]], [[submarine]], other type of maritime vessel, or [[spacecraft]]. On small vessels, particularly privately owned noncommercial vessels, the functions of [[skipper (boating)|skipper]] and helmsman may be combined in one person. On larger vessels, there is a separate [[officer of the watch]], who is responsible for the safe [[navigation]] of the ship and gives orders to the helmsman. In the [[Merchant Navy|merchant marine]], the person at the [[Ship's wheel|helm]] is usually an [[able seaman]], particularly during ship arrivals, departures, and while maneuvering in restricted waters or other conditions requiring precise steering. An [[ordinary seaman]] is commonly restricted to steering in open waters. Moreover, military ships may have a [[seaman]] or [[quartermaster]] at the helm.

A professional helmsman maintains a steady course, properly executes all rudder orders, and communicates to the officer on the bridge using navigational terms relating to ship's heading and steering. A helmsman relies upon visual references, a magnetic and [[gyrocompass]], and a rudder angle indicator to steer a steady course. The mate or other officer on the bridge directs the helmsman aboard merchant or navy ships.

Clear and exact communication between the helmsman and officer on the bridge is essential to safe navigation and ship handling. Subsequently, a set of standard steering commands, responses by the helmsman, and acknowledgment by the conning officer are widely recognized in the maritime industry. The helmsman repeats any verbal commands to demonstrate that the command is heard and understood. The International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW) requires that a helmsman be able to understand and respond to helm orders in English.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uscg.mil/hq/g-m/marpers/pag/5-00.htm "Approval of programs leading to certification as a rating forming part of a navigational watch,"] United States Coast Guard National Maritime Center.&lt;/ref&gt;

The proliferation of autopilot systems and the increased computerization of operations on a ship's bridge lessen the need for helmsmen standing watch in open waters.

==Helm commands==
Helm orders or commands fall into two categories: rudder commands and heading commands. A rudder command dictates changing the angle of the rudder, which is a single-event action. Whereas steering a heading is a comparatively long event and will require ongoing or continuous rudder adjustments.

The following are helm orders used in the United States Navy and United States Coast Guard:

'''Rudder'''
*Midships (Bring rudder angle to 0 degrees)
*Check your swing (Counter steer to stop the movement or swing of the ship's bow)
*Hard rudder (Used infrequently, such as emergencies, when maximum rudder is required)
*Left or right standard rudder (~20 degrees. Varies per ship)
*Shift your rudder (Steer the same number of degrees but opposite rudder angle)

'''Heading'''
*Steady as she goes (Steer as needed to continue current heading)
*Steady on a course (Steer as needed to bring ship on desired course)

==Acquired skills==
[[File:011212-N-1328C-502 At the Helm.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Navy sailors at the helm of an aircraft carrier in December 2001.]]
Steering a ship effectively requires skills gained through training and experience. An expert helmsman has a keen sense of how a particular ship will respond to the helm or how different sea conditions impact steering. For instance, experience teaches a helmsman the ability to correct the rudder in advance of a ship substantially falling off course. This requires the capacity to anticipate the delay between when the helm is applied and when the ship responds to the rudder. Similarly, a skilled helmsman will avoid overcompensating for a ship's movement caused by local conditions, such as wind, swells, currents, or rough seas.

===Ship simulators===
[[File:US Navy 070314-N-4965F-012 Quartermaster 1st Class Micky Young, assigned to Afloat Training Group Middle Pacific (ATG MIDPAC), operates the Navigation, Seamanship and Shiphandling Trainer (NSST) master control station.jpg|thumbnail|left|A ship bridge simulator with 3-D graphics creates scenarios with realistic sights and sounds to train mariners in ship handling.]]
Computer-based ship simulators provide a training environment for learning skills to steer a ship. Training can be programmed to replicate a variety of ship sizes and environmental conditions. Scenarios depicted in 3-D graphics range from making course corrections in open waters to maneuvering in port, rivers, or other shallow waters. Cost compared to a real vessel is low. Mariners learn responses to dangerous situations, such as steering failure, in the safety of a virtual environment.

Land-based ship simulators may feature a full-scale replica of a steering stand with a ship's wheel. Such simulators incorporate magnetic and gyro compasses (or repeaters) for steering. Moreover, a rudder angle indicator that responds appropriately to the helm is part of the configuration.

However technology also allows for a multitude of smaller workstations in a classroom setting. Administrators network student workstations so that the instructor can launch individual scenarios at each station. Computer models are used to accurately simulate conditions such as wind, seas, and currents. Moreover, shallow-water effects or other hydrodynamic forces, such as ships passing close to each other, can also be depicted. A computer application records training sessions, complete with voice commands issued by the instructor which are received by the students via a headset.

===On the job training===

On-the-job training at sea is critical to a helmsman developing ability to "sense" or anticipate how a ship will respond in different conditions.  The experienced helmsman uses measured responses to sea conditions, even when encountering heavy weather that may cause a ship to pitch and roll as it pounds its way through oncoming waves. Subsequently, the helmsman learns to relax and take into account the vessel's natural rhythm in order to avoid oversteering whatever the maritime environment. Consequently, more accurate steering is attained with less rudder. Applying the minimal rudder required to steer a course reduces drag of the ship, thereby favorably impacting the ship's speed and operating costs.

One of the helmsman's most important duties is steering a ship in a harbor or seaport when reduced speeds slow a ship's response to the rudder. For it is during ship arrivals and departures, when most ship collisions or groundings occur.&lt;ref&gt;[http://assets.opencrs.com/rpts/RL34365_20080208.pdf "Ship navigation in harbors: safety issues,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528005708/http://assets.opencrs.com/rpts/RL34365_20080208.pdf |date=2008-05-28 }} U.S. Congressional Research Service. February 8, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Clear communication, then, between the officer of the bridge and the helmsman is essential for safe operations. The officer or harbor pilot relies upon the helmsman to flawlessly execute steering commands to avoid a variety of hazards, including man-made obstacles, land formations, grounding in shallow waters, and the threat of collision with other vessels. In addition, powerful sea tides and river currents encountered in seaports heighten navigation dangers, as a ship's ability to stop is severely limited.

==Relieving the helm==
Helmsmen of merchant and military ships that are underway stand watch at the helm for a set period of time before being relieved by another watchstander. The person being relieved will complete any course change or other critical maneuver that is in progress before handing over the helm.

'''Merchant Vessels'''

The helmsman handing over the helm will inform the relief helmsman of any rudder commands in place and pertinent conditions. "Steering 180. We have oncoming traffic two points on the starboard" for example. In addition, the current helmsman should inform the relief if there are any peculiarities affecting steerage. Similarly, the helmsman will also point out if he or she is steering on a landmark, range, or navigational light. The relief helmsman is obligated to repeat the course being steered or other rudder command in order to demonstrate an understanding of the situation at the helm.

On merchant ships, it is taught at the various maritime academies that the proper way to relieve the helm is for the helmsman being relieved to call out loudly the ship's course per gyro, course per standard magnetic compass, steering mode, rudder angle, and the pump the vessel is steering off of. The relief helmsman will then take the helm and repeat all the information to ensure that he/she knows what to steer while on watch. An example of this would be:

Helmsman: "Helm is being relieved... steering two-four-eight per gyro, checking two-four-five per standard. Helm is in hand, rudder amidships, steering off the port pump."

Relief: "Helm has been relieved... steering two-four-eight per gyro, checking two-four-five per standard. Helm is in hand, rudder amidships, steering off the port pump."

The officer on watch will usually reply with "very well."

'''Normal human body temperature''', also known as '''normothermia''' or '''euthermia''', is the typical temperature range found in [[humans]]. The normal human body temperature range is typically stated as {{convert|36.5|–|37.5|C|F}}.&lt;ref name=Kar2008/&gt;

Individual body temperature depends upon the age, exertion, infection, sex, and reproductive status of the subject, the time of day, the place in the [[human body|body]] at which the measurement is made, and the subject's state of consciousness (waking, sleeping or sedated), activity level, and emotional state. It is typically maintained within this range by [[thermoregulation]].

==Methods of measurement==
[[File:Clinical thermometer 38.7.JPG|thumb|right|A [[medical thermometer]] showing a temperature reading of {{val|38.7|u=°C}}]]

Taking a person's temperature is an initial part of a full [[clinical examination]]. There are various types of [[medical thermometer]]s, as well as sites used for measurement, including:
* In the rectum (rectal temperature)
* In the mouth (oral temperature)
* Under the arm (axillary temperature)
* In the ear (tympanic temperature)
* in the nose
* In the vagina (vaginal temperature)
* In the [[bladder]]
* On the skin of the forehead over the [[Superficial temporal artery|temporal artery]]

==Variations==
[[File:Body Temp Variation.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Diurnal variation in body temperature, ranging from about {{val|37.5|u=°C}} from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., and falling to about {{val|36.4|u=°C}} from 2 a.m. to 6 a.m.]]
Temperature control ([[thermoregulation]]) is part of a [[homeostatic]] mechanism that keeps the organism at optimum [[operating temperature]], as the temperature affects the rate of [[chemical reaction]]s. In [[human]]s, the average internal temperature is {{convert|37.0|C}}, though it varies among individuals.  However, no person always has exactly the same temperature at every moment of the day.  Temperatures cycle regularly up and down through the day, as controlled by the person's [[circadian rhythm]].  The  lowest temperature occurs about two hours before the person normally wakes up.  Additionally, temperatures change according to activities and external factors.&lt;ref name="Kelly"/&gt;{{ums|date=November 2017}}

In addition to varying throughout the day, normal body temperature may also differ as much as {{convert|0.5|C-change|1}} from one day to the next, so that the highest or lowest temperatures on one day will not always exactly match the highest or lowest temperatures on the next day.

Normal human body temperature varies slightly from person to person and by the time of day. Consequently, each type of measurement has a range of normal temperatures.  The range for normal human body temperatures, taken orally, is {{val|36.8|0.5|u=°C}} ({{val|98.2|0.9|u=°F}}).&lt;ref name=Mac /&gt;  This means that any oral temperature between {{convert|36.3|and|37.3|C}} is likely to be normal.

The normal human body temperature is often stated as {{convert|36.5|–|37.5|C|F}}.&lt;ref name=Kar2008&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Karakitsos D, Karabinis A | title = Hypothermia therapy after traumatic brain injury in children | journal = N. Engl. J. Med. | volume = 359 | issue = 11 | pages = 1179–80 | date = September 2008 | pmid = 18788094 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMc081418 | url =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In adults a review of the literature has found a wider range of {{convert|33.2|–|38.2|C|F}} for normal temperatures, depending on the gender and location measured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sund-Levander M, Forsberg C, Wahren LK | title = Normal oral, rectal, tympanic and axillary body temperature in adult men and women: a systematic literature review | journal = Scand J Caring Sci | volume = 16 | issue = 2 | pages = 122–8 | date = June 2002 | pmid = 12000664 | doi = 10.1046/j.1471-6712.2002.00069.x | url =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reported values vary depending on how it is measured: oral (under the tongue): {{val|36.8|0.4|u=degC}} ({{val|{{convert|36.8|C|disp=number}}|{{convert|0.4|C-change|disp=number}}|u=degF}}),&lt;ref name="Longo"/&gt; internal ([[rectal]], [[vagina]]l): {{convert|37.0|C}}.&lt;ref name="Longo" /&gt; A rectal or vaginal measurement taken directly inside the body cavity is typically slightly higher than oral measurement, and oral measurement is somewhat higher than skin measurement. Other places, such as under the arm or in the ear, produce different typical temperatures.&lt;ref name="Longo" /&gt; While some people think of these averages as representing normal or ideal measurements, a wide range of temperatures has been found in healthy people.&lt;ref name="CC09" /&gt; The body temperature of a healthy person varies during the day by about {{convert|0.5|C-change|1}} with lower temperatures in the morning and higher temperatures in the late afternoon and evening, as the body's needs and activities change.&lt;ref name=Longo /&gt; Other circumstances also affect the body's temperature. The core body temperature of an individual tends to have the lowest value in the second half of the sleep cycle; the lowest point, called the [[nadir]], is one of the primary markers for [[circadian rhythm]]s.  The body temperature also changes when a person is hungry, sleepy, sick, or cold.

===Natural rhythms===
Body temperature normally fluctuates over the day following [[Circadian rhythm|Circadian rhythms]], with the lowest levels around 4 a.m. and the highest in the late afternoon, between 4:00 and 6:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. (assuming the person sleeps at night and stays awake during the day).&lt;ref name="Mac"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Longo /&gt; Therefore, an oral temperature of {{convert|37.3|C}} would, strictly speaking, be a normal, healthy temperature in the afternoon but not in the early morning.&lt;ref name=Longo /&gt; An individual's body temperature typically changes by about {{convert|0.5|C-change|1}} between its highest and lowest points each day.&lt;ref name=Mac /&gt;&lt;ref name=Longo /&gt;

Body temperature is sensitive to many hormones, so women have a temperature rhythm that varies with the [[menstrual cycle]], called a ''circamensal'' rhythm.&lt;ref name=Kelly /&gt;  A woman's [[basal body temperature]] rises sharply after [[ovulation]], as [[estrogen]] production decreases and [[progesterone]] increases.  [[Fertility awareness]] programs use this change to identify when a woman has ovulated in order to achieve or avoid [[pregnancy]]. During the [[luteal phase]] of the menstrual cycle, both the lowest and the average temperatures are slightly higher than during other parts of the cycle.  However, the amount that the temperature rises during each day is slightly lower than typical, so the highest temperature of the day is not very much higher than usual.&lt;ref name="Kelly1"/&gt;{{ums|date=November 2017}}  [[Hormonal contraceptive]]s both suppress the circamensal rhythm and raise the typical body temperature by about {{convert|0.6|C-change|1}}.&lt;ref name=Kelly /&gt;

Temperature also varies with the change of [[season]]s during each year.  This pattern is called a ''circannual'' rhythm.&lt;ref name=Kelly1 /&gt;  Studies of seasonal variations have produced inconsistent results.  People living in different climates may have different seasonal patterns.

Increased physical fitness increases the amount of daily variation in temperature.&lt;ref name=Kelly1 /&gt;

With increased age, both average body temperature and the amount of daily variability in the body temperature tend to decrease.&lt;ref name=Kelly1 /&gt; Elderly patients may have a decreased ability to generate body heat during a fever, so even a [[low-grade fever|somewhat elevated temperature]] can indicate a serious underlying cause in [[geriatrics]].

Different methods used for measuring temperature produce different results.  The temperature reading depends on which part of the body is being measured.  The typical daytime temperatures among healthy adults are as follows:
* Temperature in the anus (rectum/rectal), vagina, or in the ear (otic) is about {{convert|37.5|C}}&lt;ref name="Elert2005"/&gt;{{mcn|date=November 2017}}
* Temperature in the mouth (oral) is about {{convert|36.8|C}}&lt;ref name=Mac /&gt;
* Temperature under the arm (axillary) is about {{convert|36.5|C}}&lt;ref name="Elert2005" /&gt;{{mcn|date=November 2017}}

Generally, oral, rectal, gut, and core body temperatures, although slightly different, are well-correlated, with oral temperature being the lowest of the four.  Oral temperatures are generally about {{convert|0.4|C-change|1}} lower than rectal temperatures.&lt;ref name=Longo /&gt;

Oral temperatures are influenced by drinking, chewing, smoking, and breathing with the mouth open. Mouth breathing, cold drinks or food reduce oral temperatures; hot drinks, hot food, chewing, and smoking raise oral temperatures.&lt;ref name=Kelly /&gt;

Each measurement method also has different normal ranges depending on sex.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

===Variations due to outside factors===
Many outside factors affect the measured temperature as well. "Normal" values are generally given for an otherwise healthy, non-fasting adult, dressed comfortably, indoors, in a room that is kept at a normal room temperature, {{convert|22.7|to| 24.4|C|sigfig=2}}, during the morning, but not shortly after arising from sleep.  Furthermore, for oral temperatures, the subject must not have eaten, drunk, or smoked anything in at least the previous fifteen to twenty minutes, as the temperature of the food, drink, or smoke can dramatically affect the reading.

Temperature is increased after eating or drinking anything with calories.  Caloric restriction, as for a [[weight-loss diet]], decreases overall body temperature.&lt;ref name=Kelly /&gt;  Drinking [[alcohol]] decreases the amount of daily change, slightly lowering daytime temperatures and noticeably raising nighttime temperatures.&lt;ref name=Kelly /&gt;

Exercise raises body temperatures.  In adults, a noticeable increase usually requires strenuous exercise or exercise sustained over a significant time.  Children develop higher temperatures with milder activities, like playing.

Psychological factors also influence body temperature: a very excited person often has an elevated temperature.

Wearing more clothing slows daily temperature changes and raises body temperature.&lt;ref name=Kelly /&gt;  Similarly, sleeping with an [[electric blanket]] raises the body temperature at night.&lt;ref name=Kelly /&gt;

Sleep disturbances also affect temperatures.  Normally, body temperature drops significantly at a person's normal bedtime and throughout the night.  Short-term [[sleep deprivation]] produces a higher temperature at night than normal, but long-term sleep deprivation appears to reduce temperatures.&lt;ref name=Kelly /&gt;  [[Insomnia]] and poor sleep quality are associated with smaller and later drops in body temperature.&lt;ref name=Kelly /&gt;  Similarly, waking up unusually early, sleeping in, [[jet lag]] and changes to [[shift work]] schedules may affect body temperature.&lt;ref name=Kelly /&gt;

==Concepts==

===Fever===
{{Main|Fever}}
A temperature setpoint is the level at which the body attempts to maintain its temperature.  When the setpoint is raised, the result is a fever.  Most fevers are caused by [[infectious disease]] and can be lowered, if desired, with [[antipyretic]] medications.

An early morning temperature higher than {{convert|37.2|C}} or a late afternoon temperature higher than {{convert|37.7|C}} is normally considered a fever, assuming that the temperature is elevated due to a change in the hypothalamus's setpoint.&lt;ref name=Longo /&gt;  Lower thresholds are sometimes appropriate for elderly people.&lt;ref name=Longo /&gt;  The normal daily temperature variation is typically {{convert|0.5|C-change}}, but can be greater among people recovering from a fever.&lt;ref name=Longo /&gt;

An organism at optimum temperature is considered ''afebrile'' or [[Apyrexy|''apyrexic'']], meaning "without fever".  If temperature is raised, but the setpoint is not raised, then the result is [[hyperthermia]].

===Hyperthermia===
{{Main|Hyperthermia}}
Hyperthermia occurs when the body produces or absorbs more heat than it can dissipate. It is usually caused by prolonged exposure to high temperatures. The heat-regulating mechanisms of the body eventually become overwhelmed and unable to deal effectively with the heat, causing the body temperature to climb uncontrollably.  Hyperthermia at or above about {{convert|40|C}} is a life-threatening medical emergency that requires immediate treatment.  Common symptoms include headache, confusion, and fatigue.  If sweating has resulted in dehydration, then the affected person may have dry, red skin.

In a medical setting, mild hyperthermia is commonly called ''heat exhaustion'' or ''heat prostration''; severe hyperthermia is called ''heat stroke''.  Heat stroke may come on suddenly, but it usually follows the untreated milder stages.  Treatment involves cooling and rehydrating the body; fever-reducing drugs are useless for this condition.  This may be done through moving out of direct sunlight to a cooler and shaded environment, drinking water, removing clothing that might keep heat close to the body, or sitting in front of a fan.  Bathing in tepid or cool water, or even just washing the face and other exposed areas of the skin, can be helpful.

With fever, the body's core temperature rises to a higher temperature through the action of the part of the brain that controls the body temperature; with hyperthermia, the body temperature is raised without the influence of the heat control centers.

===Hypothermia===
{{Main|Hypothermia}}

In hypothermia,  body temperature drops below that required for normal metabolism and bodily functions.  In humans, this is usually due to excessive exposure to cold air or water, but it can be [[Therapeutic hypothermia|deliberately induced as a medical treatment]].  Symptoms usually appear when the body's core temperature drops by {{convert|1|-|2|C-change}} below normal temperature.

===Basal body temperature===
{{Main|Basal body temperature}}

Basal body temperature is the lowest temperature attained by the body during rest (usually during sleep). It is generally measured immediately after awakening and before any physical activity has been undertaken, although the temperature measured at that time is somewhat higher than the true basal body temperature.  In women, temperature differs at various points in the [[menstrual cycle]], and this can be used in the long-term to track ovulation both for the purpose of aiding conception or avoiding pregnancy.  This process is called [[fertility awareness]].

===Core temperature===
Core temperature, also called core body temperature, is the operating temperature of an [[organism]], specifically in deep structures of the body such as the [[liver]], in comparison to temperatures of peripheral tissues.  Core temperature is normally maintained within a narrow range so that essential enzymatic reactions can occur. Significant core temperature elevation ([[hyperthermia]]) or depression ([[hypothermia]]) that is prolonged for more than a brief period of time is incompatible with human life.

Temperature examination in the [[rectum]] is the traditional [[gold standard (test)|gold standard]] measurement used to estimate core temperature (oral temperature is affected by hot or cold drinks and mouth-breathing). Rectal temperature is expected to be approximately one Fahrenheit degree higher than an oral temperature taken on the same person at the same time. Ear thermometers measure eardrum temperature using [[infrared]] sensors. The blood supply to the [[tympanic membrane]] is shared with the [[brain]]. However, this method of measuring body temperature is not as accurate as rectal measurement and has a low sensitivity for fevers, missing three or four out of every ten fevers in children.&lt;ref name="Dodd"/&gt; Ear temperature measurement may be acceptable for observing trends in body temperature but is less useful in consistently identifying fevers.

Until recently, direct measurement of core body temperature required surgical insertion of a probe, so a variety of indirect methods have commonly been used.  The [[rectum|rectal]] or [[vagina]]l temperature is generally considered to give the most accurate assessment of core body temperature, particularly in hypothermia. In the early 2000s, ingestible [[thermistor]]s in [[Capsule (pharmacy)|capsule]] form were produced, allowing the temperature inside the [[digestive tract]] to be transmitted to an external receiver; one study found that these were comparable in accuracy to rectal temperature measurement.&lt;ref name="SciDirect"/&gt;

==Historical understanding==
In the 19th century, most books quoted "blood heat" as 98 °F, until a study published the mean (but not the variance) of a large sample as {{convert|36.88|C|F}}.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110713052807/http://www.inwit.com/inwit/writings/fahrenheitcelsiusactivity.html Inwit Publishing, Inc. and Inwit, LLC – Writings, Links and Software Demonstrations – A Fahrenheit–Celsius Activity]. inwit.com.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently that mean was widely quoted as "37 °C or 98.4 °F"&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford Dictionary of English]], 2010 edition, entry on "blood heat"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collins English Dictionary, 1979 edition, entry on [https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/blood-heat "blood heat"]&lt;/ref&gt; until editors realised 37 °C is closer to 98.6 °F than 98.4 °F. Dictionaries and other sources that quoted these averages did add the word "about" to show that there is some variance, but generally did not state how wide the variance is.

'''Joceline Clemencia''' (30 November 1952&amp;nbsp;– 30 May 2011) was an [[Afro-Curaçaoan]] writer, linguist, feminist and independence activist. She agitated for the [[Creole language]] spoken in Curaçao, [[Papiamento]], to become an official language and was successful in the struggle, having created both language schools and texts to further its cultural significance. She was in favor of full independence of Curaçao from the Netherlands.

==Early life==
Joceline Andrea Clemencia was born on 30 November 1952 in Curaçao.&lt;ref name="birth"&gt;{{cite web|title=Celebrating The Independentista Legacy of Joceline Clemencia|url=https://triunfodisablika.wordpress.com/2015/12/09/celebrating-the-independentista-legacy-of-joceline-clemencia/|publisher=Triunfo di Sablika|accessdate=17 February 2016|location=Curaçao|date=9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She completed her higher education in Amsterdam, earning a doctorate&lt;ref name="juror"&gt;{{cite web|title=Premio Literario Casa de las Américas Award: 2006 Jury|url=http://www.casa.cult.cu/premios/literario/2006/jurados.php|publisher=Casa Cultural|accessdate=18 February 2016|location=Havana, Cuba|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;  degree in Spanish and Spanish literature from the [[University of Amsterdam]]. During her student days, she became involved in several activist movements including worldwide protests against the [[Vietnam War]] and the independence movements of the [[Netherlands Antilles]].&lt;ref name="Amigoe Nieuws"&gt;{{cite news|title=Onafhankelijkheidsstrijder Joceline Clemencia (58) overleden|url=http://kkc.curacao.nl/viewtopic.php?f=31&amp;t=739|accessdate=17 February 2016|publisher=''Amigoe Nieuws''|date=31 May 2011|location=Willemstad, Curaçao|language=Dutch|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160217231246/http://kkc.curacao.nl/viewtopic.php?f=31&amp;t=739|archivedate=17 February 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1980s, Clemencia returned to Curaçao and began working as a Spanish teacher at the Peter Stuyvesant College,&lt;ref name="Monart 2011"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Monart|first1=Sharlon|title=Joceline Clemencia: Een leven in teken van emancipatie|url=http://archief.wereldomroep.nl/caribiana/article/joceline-clemencia-een-leven-teken-van-emancipatie|accessdate=17 February 2016|publisher=Radio Nederland Wereldomroep Aworaki|date=31 May 2011|location=The Netherlands|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; now the Kolegio Alejandro Paula, in Willemstad, Curaçao.&lt;ref name="Kolegio Alejandro Paula"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kolegio Alejandro Paula|url=http://www.docomomocuracao.org/pages/sub/18609/Kolegio_Alejandro_Paula.html|publisher=Do co mo mo Curaçao|accessdate=17 February 2016|location=Willemstad, Curaçao|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160224053757/http://docomomocuracao.org/pages/sub/18609/Kolegio_Alejandro_Paula.html|archivedate=24 February 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large part of her activism centered on the [[Papiamento]] language and its suppression. By the early 1990s, she was serving as director of the ''Instituto di Nashonal Sede di Papiamentu'' (National Institute of the Papiamento Language) to promote usage and teaching of the native language of Aruba, Bonaire and Curaçao. Because Papiamento has roots in the slave trade, there was little public support in preserving the language or teaching it in the Dutch school system. She advocated for the language to be standardized and taught, as it was the mother-tongue of the country.{{sfn|Clemencia|1999}}&lt;ref name="Stedehouder, 2011"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stedehouder|first1=Jan|title=In memoriam: Joceline Clemencia|url=http://www.janstedehouder.nl/2011/06/01/in-memoriam-joceline-clemencia-2/|publisher=Jan Stedehouder|accessdate=17 February 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604144257/http://www.janstedehouder.nl/2011/06/01/in-memoriam-joceline-clemencia-2|archivedate=4 June 2011|location=The Netherlands|date=1 June 2011|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Garrett|2000|pp=41, 43}} In a report prepared for UNESCO, Clemencia argued  that Papiamentu and English should be declared the national languages of the Antilles.{{sfn|Clemencia|1999|p=31}}

Clemencia also served as a supervisor in the Government Bureau of Linguistics.&lt;ref name="juror" /&gt; She founded and became the director of the ''Instituto Kultural Independensha'' (Institute of Cultural Independence) in 1996 with the goal of teaching Papiamento. She also founded the ''Skol Nobo'' (New School) to teach cultural history, including, art, sport, and nature studies which were not included in other school curricula.&lt;ref name="NiNsee obit"&gt;{{cite news|title=Joceline Clemencia overleden|url=http://www.ninsee.nl/news/Joceline-Clemencia-overleden|accessdate=18 February 2016|publisher=NiNsee|date=31 May 2011|location=Willemstad, Curaçao|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clemencia co-wrote with Omayra Leeflang a text for teaching Papiamento entitled ''Papiamentu Funshonal'', which became a standard for secondary education instruction.&lt;ref name="Monart 2011" /&gt; Her efforts at recognition of Papiamentu as an official language were finally successful in 2007, when the government accepted it as one of the official languages, along with Dutch and English.&lt;ref name="official language"&gt;{{cite news|title=Antilles allow Papiamentu as official language|url=http://www.atmost.nl/pdf/week_10_2007_klein.pdf|accessdate=18 February 2016|publisher=''The Times''|date=9 March 2007|location=The Hague, The Netherlands|page=2, col. 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through her study of language, Clemencia wrote about women and their relationships to language and communication. The terms and customs that women used among themselves to give messages about themselves were one of the themes she often wrote about.&lt;ref name="Calixte 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Calixte|first1=Shana L.|title=Things Which Aren't To Be Given Names: Afro-Caribbean and Diasporic Negotiations of Same Gender Desire and Sexual Relations|journal=Canadian Woman Studies|date=2005|volume=24|issue=2–3|pages=128–137 |url=http://cws.journals.yorku.ca/index.php/cws/article/viewFile/6130/5318|publisher=Inanna|location=Toronto, Canada|issn=0713-3235}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a member of the Caribbean Association of Women and Scholars (ACWWS), Clemencia participated in conferences and meetings to promote a feminist identity which recognized the diversity of women from the Caribbean and allow their contributions to be told in their own voice, be that Dutch, English, French, Spanish&lt;ref name="Perdomo, 2015"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Perdomo|first1=Ylonka Nacidit|title=Una hermosa visita al Centro Cultural Eduardo León Jiménes|url=http://acento.com.do/2015/opinion/8212056-una-hermosa-visita-al-centro-cultural-eduardo-leon-jimenes/|accessdate=18 February 2016|publisher=Acento|date=12 January 2015|location=Santo Domingo, República Dominicana|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Creole languages]], as the language used defines an identity strategy for the writer.{{sfn|Arnold|Rodríguez-Luis|Dash|2001|p=362}} Though an ardent feminist, Clemencia believed that general emancipation, including identity, independence and language, were critical elements in attaining political freedom.&lt;ref name="Monart 2011" /&gt;

During the early years of the 21st century, facing high unemployment and social unrest in Curaçao, Clemencia joined with other intellectuals and in 2006 formed the Grupo Pro Defensa di Kòrsou (Group in Favor of the Defense of Curaçao) and a political party called Partido Indepensha (Independence Party).&lt;ref name="Amigoe Nieuws" /&gt; She was the party chair&lt;ref name="chair"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clemencia|first1=Joceline|title=Colonialism by Consent: Changing of the Colonial Guard|journal=North Star Compass|date=January 2011|volume=20|issue=12|page=22|url=http://www.northstarcompass.org/nsc1101/nsc1101.pdf|accessdate=18 February 2016|publisher=International Council for Friendship and Solidarity with Soviet People and The Society of Carpatho-Russian Canadians|location=Toronto, Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; and campaigned vigorously for independence from The Netherlands.&lt;ref name="anti-colonial"&gt;{{cite web|title=Referendum mark people's victory in anti-colonial struggle in Curaçao|url=http://www.tlaxcala.es/pp.asp?reference=7744&amp;lg=en|publisher=The Translators' Network for Linguistic Diversity|accessdate=18 February 2016|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though she combined her party's influence with {{Interlanguage link multi|Anthony Godett|nl}}'s [[Party Workers' Liberation Front 30 May]], they were defeated&lt;ref name="Amigoe Nieuws" /&gt; and the final results of the referendum was not full independence.

==Personal==
Clemencia was married to Frank Kirindongo (also known as Frank Quirindongo), with whom she had three children before their divorce.&lt;ref name="Amigoe Nieuws" /&gt; She died on 30 May 2011 in Willemstad after a two-year battle with breast cancer.&lt;ref name="NiNsee obit" /&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Przysiega Kosciuszki.jpg|thumb|right|...and on a [[1911]] painting by [[Wojciech Kossak]] {{ifdc|Image:Przysiega Kosciuszki.jpg|log=18 September 2007}}]] --&gt;
'''Kościuszko's proclamation''' refers to a speech given by [[Tadeusz Kościuszko]] in [[Kraków]] on March 24, 1794. The speech is considered the starting point of the [[Kościuszko's Uprising]] against the forces of [[Imperial Russia]] occupying Poland.

Around 10 o'clock in the Old Town square in Kraków, the Act of Insurrection was read by Kraków's [[Sejm]] representative.&lt;ref name=Storozynski/&gt;{{rp|182}} The document gave Tadeusz Kościuszko command over the ''National Armed Force'' ({{Lang-pl|Siła Zbrojna Narodowa}}) and he vowed to convene a Supreme National Council.&lt;ref name=Storozynski/&gt;{{rp|180}}  Drafted by Hugo Kollontay, an advocate of [[physiocracy]], it began with:&lt;ref name=Storozynski/&gt;{{rp|180}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The wretched state in which Poland finds itself is known to the universe; the indiginities of two neighboring powers, and the crimes of traitors to their country have sunk this nation into an abyss of misery."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Soon afterwards Kościuszko stepped forward and recited his oath:&lt;ref name=Storozynski&gt;Storozynski, A., 2009, The Peasant Prince, New York: St. Martin's Press, {{ISBN|9780312388027}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|182}}

{{Cquote|I, Tadeusz Kościuszko, hereby swear by the God to the entire Polish Nation, that I shall not use the powers vested in me for anyone's oppression, but for defence of the integrity of the borders, recuperation of Nation's sovereignty and strengthening the universal freedom. ''So help me God and the innocent passion of His Son!''}}

==Aftermath==
On 10 May, the council was appointed by Kosciuszko, which was led by Kolontay as the minister of treasury, Potocki as minister of foreign affairs, and other ministers for justice, security, military needs, provisions, national affairs and administrative affairs.&lt;ref name=Storozynski/&gt;{{rp|192}}  The council coined money with "Freedom, Unity, Independence-The Republic, 1794" on the new [[zloty]].&lt;ref name=Storozynski/&gt;{{rp|192}}

Kosciuszko stated the council was formed of "...virtuous citizens and friends of the people, and when I nominated them, I did not want to think about whether they are peasants, burghers or aristocrats.".&lt;ref name=Storozynski/&gt;{{rp|193}}

'''Kpwe''' (Mokpwe) is a [[Bantu language]] of [[Cameroon]]. It is mutually intelligible with '''Kole''', and probably with '''Mboko''' (Wumboko) as well.

'''Language for specific purposes''' ('''LSP''') has been primarily used to refer to two areas within applied linguistics:  
# One focusing on the needs in education and training
# One with a focus on research on language variation across a particular subject field

LSP can be used with any target language needed by the learners as a tool for specific purposes, and has often been applied to English ('''English for specific purposes''', or '''ESP'''). 

A third approach, content or theme-based language instruction (CBI) has also been confused with LSP.  These several uses of the label of LSP have caused some confusion internationally.

==Education and training==
LSP is a widely applied approach to second or foreign language teaching and training that addresses immediate and very specific needs of learners who need that language as a tool in their education, training or job. Needs analysis is the underlying "driver" for the development of LSP programs.&lt;ref&gt;Hutchinson &amp; Waters 1987, Robinson 1980, Swales, 185, 1992, Hyland 2002&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, English native speaking nurses who work in hospitals with a high percentage patient whose native language is Spanish might have to study Spanish for the very specific purpose of communication between nurses and patients.
Students are encouraged to take active roles in their own learning and question what they have been taught. This is likened to negotiated syllabus about which Hyland (2009)&lt;ref&gt;Hyland, K. (2009). Specific purpose programs. In M. H. Long &amp; C. J. Doughty (eds.), The handbook of language teaching (pp. 201-217). Singapore:Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; writes, "A negotiated syllabus means that the content of a particular course is a matter of discussion between teacher and students, according to the wishes and needs of the learners in conjunction with the expertise, judgement, and advice of the teacher" (p. 208).

==Research==
"Language for specific purposes" has also been used to refer to a branch of [[applied linguistics]] which deals with a variety of language used by members of a particular subject field, concentrating on its [[genre]]s, [[stylistics (field of study)|stylistic]] features and technical [[lexis (linguistics)|lexis]]. This research is relevant for such problem-based areas as [[language education]], [[translation]] and the [[lexicography|design of specialised dictionaries]]. Some in the training area consider such research on Professional Communications as LSP-related research when it is paired with or applied directly to an LSP training program.

==Relationship to content-based instruction==
[[Content-based instruction|Content-based language instruction]] (CBI) is also sometimes confused with ESP.  At the post-secondary level it is frequently used to motivate groups of learners who may be interested in the same professional field, providing meaningful communication opportunities.  However, as in their regular studies they are usually not studying through a foreign/second language (except for sheltered courses), they do not need English as a tool in their immediate studies. "Content-based instruction (CBI) is the integration of selected content with language teaching aims".&lt;ref&gt;Brinton, D. M., Snow, M. A., &amp; Wesche, M. B. (1989). ''Content-based second language instruction.'' New York: Newbury House.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, when trying to identify which approach being taken, the question is: "Is it English for Specific Purposes or English through specific content themes or content areas?"

'''[[Lesotho]]''', a [[country]] in [[Southern Africa]], is home to several '''languages''', including [[Phuthi language|Phuthi]], [[Sesotho language|Sesotho]], [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]], [[Zulu language|Zulu]] and [[English language|English]], — all, except for English, belong to the [[Niger–Congo languages|Niger–Congo]] [[language family]].&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |title=Lesotho |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/337126/Lesotho |accessdate=3 October 2010 |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== National and official languages ==

[[Sesotho language|Sesotho]] (or Southern Sesotho), a [[Southern Bantu languages|Southern Bantu]] language, is the [[national language]] of Lesotho,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dalby|2004|p=576}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Deprez|Du Plessis|Teck|2001|p=175}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The name "Lesotho" translates roughly as "the land of the people who speak Sesotho", Sesotho meaning "the Sesotho language"; see {{Harvnb|Itano|2007|p=314}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and is spoken by most [[Basotho]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The people of Lesotho are called Basotho (sing. Mosotho), where "ba-" indicates plural; see {{Harvnb|Rosenberg|Weisfelder|Frisbie-Fulton|2005|p=12}} and {{Harvnb|Van Wyk|1998|p=54}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was recognized as the national language by the National and Official Languages Bill, ratified by the [[National Assembly of Lesotho]] on 12 September 1966, which also established Sesotho and English as the country's two [[official language]]s.&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rosenberg|Weisfelder|Frisbie-Fulton|2005|p=319}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The country's [[language policy]] promotes [[bilingualism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Legère|Fitchat|Akindele|2002|p=109}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and Chapter 1 of the Constitution of Lesotho states:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aceproject.org/ero-en/regions/africa/LS/Constitution%20of%20Lesotho%201993.pdf |title=The Constitution of Lesotho |year=1993 |work=ACE Electoral Knowledge Network |format=[[PDF]] |accessdate=6 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|text=The official languages of Lesotho shall be Sesotho and English and, accordingly, no instrument or transaction shall be invalid by reason only that it is expressed or conducted in one of those languages.|source=The Constitution of Lesotho, 1993}}

Sesotho is the [[first language]] of more than 90 percent of the population&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Baker|Prys Jones|1998|p=270}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and is "used widely as a medium of communication" in day-to-day speech.&lt;ref name="Baker &amp; Prys Jones 1998: 315"&gt;{{Harvnb|Baker|Prys Jones|1998|p=315}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  English is reserved for official interactions,&lt;ref name="Baker &amp; Prys Jones 1998: 315"/&gt; such as "government and administration",&lt;ref name="Baker &amp; Prys Jones 1998: 361"&gt;{{Harvnb|Baker|Prys Jones|1998|p=361}}.&lt;/ref&gt; although the use of Sesotho in politics, religion, and the mass media is growing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Baker|Prys Jones|1998|pp=270, 361}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Primary education]] of children takes place in Sesotho for the first four years, but English becomes the [[medium of instruction]] in the fifth year of [[primary school]].&lt;ref name="Baker &amp; Prys Jones 1998: 361"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lesothotokyo.org/en/basic_data/index.html |title=Basic Facts |work=The Embassy of the Kingdom of Lesotho – Tokyo, Japan |accessdate=3 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Competence in English is "particularly important ... for educational, political, social and economic transactions in the subcontinent"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Legère|Fitchat|Akindele|2002|p=114}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and facilitates obtaining employment within Lesotho and abroad.&lt;ref name="Webb 1995: 96"&gt;{{Harvnb|Webb|1995|p=96}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although "efforts are made to ensure that Basotho children" learn to read, speak and write English,&lt;ref name="Webb 1995: 96"/&gt; many Basotho complete only "basic primary education [and] remain monolingual in Sesotho".&lt;ref name="Baker &amp; Prys Jones 1998: 361"/&gt;

== Minority and immigrant languages ==

A minority of Basotho, estimated to number 248,000 {{as of|1993|lc=on}}, speak [[Zulu language|Zulu]], one of the eleven official languages of [[South Africa]].&lt;ref name="Ethnologue (16th ed): Lesotho"&gt;{{Harvnb|Lewis|2009}}, [http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=lesotho Lesotho] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110704041915/http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=Lesotho |date=2011-07-04 }} at [[Ethnologue]]. Retrieved 3 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Phuthi language|Phuthi]], a [[Nguni languages|Nguni language]] closely related to [[Swazi language|Swazi]], an official language of South Africa and [[Swaziland]], is spoken by 43,000 Basotho ({{as of|2002|lc=on}}).&lt;ref name="Ethnologue (16th ed): Lesotho"/&gt;  [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]], another Nguni language and official language of South Africa, is spoken by 18,000 people in Lesotho.&lt;ref name="Ethnologue (16th ed): Lesotho"/&gt;  Speakers of these [[minority language]]s typically also speak Sotho.&lt;ref name="Baker &amp; Prys Jones 1998: 361"/&gt;

'''Latvian State Language Centre''' (VVC; {{lang-lv|Valsts valodas centrs}}) is a direct administration institution subordinated to the [[Minister of Justice]] of the [[Republic of Latvia]]. The purpose of the State Language Centre is to implement the national policy on the use of the [[official language]]. The Centre supervises and controls the conformity with laws and regulations on the use of official language, provides the State administration institutions and the public with official translations of laws and regulations and other documents issued by the State or international organisations while concurrently ensuring use of consistent [[terminology]]. The State Language Centre protects rights and interests of the official language users, promotes the regularisation of the cultural environment of language and promotes comprehensive functioning of [[Latvian language]].

A '''log cabin''' is a dwelling constructed of [[logging|logs]], especially a less finished or architecturally sophisticated structure. Log cabins have an ancient history in Europe, and in America are often associated with first generation home building by settlers.

==European history==

Construction with logs was described by Roman architect [[Vitruvius Pollio]] in his architectural treatise ''[[De Architectura]]''. He noted that in [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]] (modern-day northeastern Turkey), dwellings were constructed by laying logs horizontally overtop of each other and filling in the gaps with "chips and mud".&lt;ref name="De Architectura"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pollio|first=Vitruvius|title=Ten Books on Architecture|year=1914|publisher=Harvard University Press|page=39|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/20239/20239-h/29239-h.htm#Page_42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically log cabin construction has its roots in [[Scandinavia]] and [[Eastern Europe]]. Although their origin is uncertain, the first log structures were probably being built in [[Northern Europe]] by the [[Bronze Age]] (about [[35th century BC|3500 BC]]). C. A. Weslager describes Europeans as having: {{clear left}}{{quote|
 "...accomplished in building several forms of log housing, having different methods of corner timbering, and they utilized both round and hewn logs. Their log building had undergone an evolutionary process from the crude "pirtti"...a small gabled-roof cabin of round logs with an opening in the roof to vent smoke, to more sophisticated squared logs with interlocking double-notch joints, the timber extending beyond the corners. Log saunas or bathhouses of this type are still found in rural Finland."

By stacking tree trunks one on top of another and overlapping the logs at the corners, people made the "log cabin". They developed interlocking corners by notching the logs at the ends, resulting in strong structures that were easier to make weather-tight by inserting [[moss]] or other soft material into the joints. As the original [[Temperate coniferous forest|coniferous forest]] extended over the coldest parts of the world, there was a prime need to keep these cabins warm. The [[Thermal insulation|insulating]] properties of the solid wood were a great advantage over a [[Timber framing|timber frame]] construction covered with animal skins, [[felt]], boards or [[Roof shingle|shingles]]. Over the decades, increasingly complex [[Woodworking joints|joints]] were developed to ensure more weather tight joints between the logs, but the profiles were still largely based on the round log.|C. A. Weslager|&lt;ref name="Wes"&gt;Weslager, C. A. (1969), ''The Log Cabin in America, New Brunswick, New Jersey'', Rutgers University Press, [http://www.nps.gov/nr/twhp/wwwlps/lessons/4logcabins/4facts1.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;}} Nevertheless, a medieval log cabin was considered movable property (a [[chattel house]]), as evidenced by the relocation of [[Espoo|Espåby]] village in 1557: the buildings were simply disassembled, transported to a new location and reassembled. It was also common to replace individual logs damaged by [[dry rot]] as necessary.

The Wood Museum in [[Trondheim]], [[Norway]], displays fourteen different traditional profiles, but a basic form of log construction was used all over North Europe and Asia and later imported to America.

Log construction was especially suited to Scandinavia, where straight, tall tree trunks ([[pine]] and [[spruce]]) are readily available. With suitable tools, a log cabin can be erected from scratch in days by a family. As no chemical reaction is involved, such as hardening of mortar, a log cabin can be erected in any weather or season. Many older towns in Northern Scandinavia have been built exclusively out of log houses, which have been decorated by board paneling and wood cuttings. Today, construction of modern log cabins as leisure homes is a fully developed industry in Finland and Sweden. Modern log cabins often feature [[fiberglass]] insulation and are sold as prefabricated kits machined in a factory, rather than hand-built in the field like ancient log cabins.

Log cabins are mostly constructed without the use of nails and thus derive their stability from simple stacking, with only a few [[dowel]] joints for reinforcement. This is because a log cabin tends to compress slightly as it settles, over a few months or years. Nails would soon be out of alignment and torn out.

==European settlers in the United States==
[[File:Nothnagle Log House.JPG|thumb|right|[[C. A. Nothnagle Log House]] c. 1640, near [[Swedesboro, New Jersey|Swedesboro]], New Jersey]]
In the present-day United States, settlers may have first constructed log cabins by 1638. Historians believe that the first log cabins built in North America were in the Swedish colony of Nya Sverige ([[New Sweden]]) in the [[Delaware River]] and [[Brandywine Creek (Christina River)|Brandywine River]] valleys. Many of its colonists were actually [[Forest Finns]], because Finland was part of Sweden at that time. New Sweden only briefly existed before it became the Dutch colony of [[New Netherland]], which later became the English colony of New York. The Swedish-Finnish colonists' quick and easy construction techniques not only remained, but spread.{{citation needed|date = June 2013}}

Later [[German people|German]] and [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] immigrants also used this technique.  The contemporaneous British settlers had no tradition of building with logs, but they quickly adopted the method.  The first [[English people|English settlers]] did not widely use log cabins, building in forms more traditional to them.&lt;ref name="Bomberger"&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/tps/briefs/brief26.htm Bomberger D., "The Preservation and Repair of Historic Log Buildings"], National Park Service, 1991, accessed 6 Dec 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  Few log cabins dating from the 18th century still stand, but they were often not intended as permanent dwellings. Possibly the oldest surviving log house in the United States is the [[C. A. Nothnagle Log House]] (ca. 1640) in New Jersey. Settlers often built log cabins as temporary homes to live in while constructing larger, permanent houses; then they often used the log cabins as outbuildings, such as barns or [[chicken coop]]s.{{citation needed|date = June 2013}}
[[File:Valley Forge cabin.jpg|thumb|right|Replica log cabin at [[Valley Forge]], [[Pennsylvania]]]]

Log cabins were sometimes hewn on the outside so that [[siding]] might be applied; they also might be hewn inside and covered with a variety of materials, ranging from [[plaster]] over [[lath]] to [[wallpaper]].{{citation needed|date = June 2013}}

Log cabins were built from logs laid horizontally and interlocked on the ends with notches (British English ''cog joints''). Some log cabins were built without notches and simply nailed together, but this was not as structurally sound. Modern building methods allow this shortcut.
[[File:Cabin corner 8053.JPG|left|thumbnail|upright|Details of cabin corner joint with squared off logs]]
The most important aspect of cabin building is the site upon which the cabin was built. Site selection was aimed at providing the cabin inhabitants with both sunlight and drainage to make them better able to cope with the rigors of frontier life.  Proper site selection placed the home in a location best suited to manage the farm or ranch.  When the first pioneers built cabins, they were able to "cherry pick" the best logs for cabins. These were old-growth trees with few limbs (knots) and straight with little taper.  Such logs did not need to be hewn to fit well together.  Careful notching minimized the size of the gap between the logs and reduced the amount of chinking (sticks or rocks) or daubing (mud) needed to fill the gap. The length of one log was generally the length of one wall, although this was not a limitation for most good cabin builders.

Decisions had to be made about the type of cabin. Styles varied greatly from one part of the US to another: the size of the cabin, the number of stories, type of roof, the orientation of doors and windows all needed to be taken into account when the cabin was designed.  In addition, the source of the logs, the source of stone and available labor, either human or animal, had to be considered. If timber sources were further away from the site, the cabin size might be limited.

Cabin corners were often set on large stones; if the cabin was large, other stones were used at other points along the sill (bottom log).  Since they were usually cut into the sill, thresholds were supported with rock as well. These stones are found below the corners of many 18th-century cabins as they are restored.  Cabins were set on foundations to keep them out of damp soil but also to allow for storage or basements to be constructed below the cabin.  Cabins with earth floors had no need for foundations.
[[File:Minnesota family 1890..jpg|thumb|right|Log cabin in Minnesota]]
Cabins were constructed using a variety of notches.  Notches can vary within ethnic groups as well as between them.  Notches often varied on a single building, so their styles were not conclusive.
One method common in the Ohio River Valley in southwestern Ohio and southeastern Indiana is the Block House End Method an example of this is found in the [[David Brown House]].

Some older buildings in the United States [[Midwest]] and the [[Canadian Prairies]] are log structures covered with [[Clapboard (architecture)|clapboards]] or other materials.  Nineteenth-century cabins used as dwellings were occasionally plastered on the interior.  The O'Farrell Cabin (ca. 1865) in [[Boise, Idaho|Boise]], Idaho had backed wallpaper used over newspaper.  The C.C.A. Christenson Cabin in Ephraim, Utah (ca. 1880) was plastered over willow lath.

Log cabins reached their peak of complexity and elaboration with the [[Adirondack Architecture|Adirondack]]-style cabins of the mid-19th century.  This style was the inspiration for many [[United States Park Service]] lodges built at the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th century. Log cabin building never died out or fell out of favor.  It was surpassed by the needs of a growing urban United States. During the 1930s and the [[Great Depression]], the Roosevelt Administration directed the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] to build log lodges throughout the west for use by the [[United States Forest Service|Forest Service]] and the [[National Park Service]].  [[Timberline Lodge]] on [[Mount Hood]] in [[Oregon]] was such a log structure, and it was dedicated by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]].

In 1930, the world's largest log cabin was constructed at a private resort in [[Montebello, Quebec|Montebello]], Quebec, [[Canada]].  Often described as a "log château", it serves as the [[Château Montebello]] hotel.

The modern version of a log cabin is the [[log home]], which is a house built usually from milled logs. The logs are visible on the exterior and sometimes interior of the house. These cabins are mass manufactured, traditionally in Scandinavian countries and increasingly in eastern Europe.  Squared milled logs are precut for easy assembly. Log homes are popular in rural areas, and even in some suburban locations.  In many resort communities in the United States West, homes of log and stone measuring over {{convert|3000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} are not uncommon.  These "kit" log homes are one of the largest consumers of logs in the Western United States.

In the United States, log homes have embodied a traditional approach to home building; one that has resonated throughout American history. It is especially interesting to discover that, in today's world, log homes represent a technology that allows a home to be built with a high degree of [[sustainability]]. In fact, log homes are frequently considered to be on the leading edge of the [[green building]] movement.

[[Crib barn]]s were a popular type of barn found throughout the U.S. south and southeast regions. Crib barns were especially ubiquitous in the Appalachian and Ozark Mountain states of North Carolina, Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee and Arkansas.

In Europe, modern log cabins are often built in gardens and used as summerhouses, home offices or as an additional room in the garden. Summer houses and cottages are often built from logs in northern Europe.

Chinking refers to  a broad range of [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]] or other infill materials used between the logs in the construction of log cabins and other log-walled structures. Traditionally, dried mosses, such as ''Pleurozium schreberi'' or ''Hylocomium splendens'', were used in the Nordic countries as an insulator between logs. In the United States,  ''Chinks'' were small stones or wood or corn cobs stuffed between the logs.

==Roofing==
Log cabins were constructed with either a [[purlin]] roof structure or a [[rafter]] roof structure. A purlin roof consists of horizontal logs that are notched into the gable-wall logs. The latter are progressively shortened to form the characteristic triangular gable end. The steepness of the roof was determined by the reduction in size of each gable-wall log as well as the total number of gable-wall logs. Flatter roofed cabins might have had only 2 or 3 gable-wall logs while steeply pitched roofs might have had as many gable-wall logs as a full story. Issues related to eave overhang and a porch also influenced the layout of the cabin.

The decision about roof type often was based on the material for roofing like bark. Milled lumber was usually the most popular choice for rafter roofs in areas where it was available.  These roofs typify many log cabins built in the 20th century, having full-cut [[Lumber#Dimensional lumber|2×4]] rafters covered with pine and [[Cedar wood|cedar]] shingles.  The purlin roofs found in rural settings and locations, where milled lumber was not available, often were covered with long hand-split shingles.

==Symbolism==
[[File:Abe-Lincoln-Birthplace-2.jpg|thumb|Log cabin at [[Abraham Lincoln Birthplace]]]]
The log cabin has been a symbol of humble origins in US politics since the early 19th century. Seven [[United States President]]s were born in log cabins, including [[Abraham Lincoln]], [[Andrew Jackson]], and [[James Buchanan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/whho/historyculture/places.htm "President's Park (White House)"], National Park Service, accessed 2 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  Although [[William Henry Harrison]] was not one of them, he and the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whigs]] during the [[United States presidential election, 1840|1840 presidential election]] were the first to use a log cabin&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=William Henry Harrison Log Cabin Campaign Souvenir; JQ Adams Signed; "Revolution" in (Campaign) Habits|url=http://www.shapell.org/Data/Uploads/498a-item-page.jpg|work=Shapell Manuscript Foundation|publisher=SMF}}&lt;/ref&gt;  as a symbol to show North Americans that he was a man of the people. Other candidates followed Harrison's example, making the idea of a log cabin—and, more generally, a non-wealthy background—a recurring theme in campaign [[biography|biographies]].&lt;ref name="lepore"/&gt;

More than a century after Harrison, [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]] acknowledged: "I wasn't born in a log cabin.  I didn't work my way through school nor did I rise from rags to riches, and there's no use trying to pretend I did."&lt;ref name="lepore"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lepore|first1=Jill|authorlink=Jill Lepore|title=Bound for Glory: Writing Campaign Lives|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/10/20/bound-for-glory?currentPage=all|accessdate=8 March 2015|work=[[The New Yorker]]|date=20 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stevenson lost the [[United States presidential election, 1952|1952 presidential election]] in a landslide to [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]].

==Toys==
A popular children's toy in the US is [[Lincoln Logs]], consisting of various notched [[dowel rod]]s that can be fitted together to build scale miniature-sized structures.

'''Lojban''' (pronounced {{IPA-art|ˈloʒban||jbo-lojban.ogg}}) is a [[constructed language|constructed]], [[Syntactic ambiguity|syntactically unambiguous]] human language&lt;!-- based on [[predicate logic]]--&gt;, succeeding the [[Loglan]] project.

The Logical Language Group (LLG) began developing Lojban in 1987. The LLG sought to realize [[Loglan]]'s purposes, and further improve the language by making it more usable and freely available (as indicated by its official full English title, "Lojban: A Realization of Loglan"). After a long initial period of debating and testing, the baseline was completed in 1997, and published as ''The Complete Lojban Language''. In an interview in 2010 with ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Arika Okrent]], the author of ''In the Land of Invented Languages'', stated: "The constructed language with the most complete grammar is probably Lojban—a language created to reflect the principles of logic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=March 10, 2010 |url=http://schott.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/10/questions-answered-invented-languages/ |title=Questions Answered: Invented Languages |publisher=The New York Times Schott's Vocab blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lojban is proposed as a speakable language for communication between people of different language backgrounds, as a potential means of machine translation and to explore the intersection of human language and software.

==Etymology==
The name "{{lang|jbo|Lojban}}" is a [[compound (linguistics)|compound]] formed from {{lang|jbo|loj}} and {{lang|jbo|ban}}, which are short forms of {{lang|jbo|logji}} (logic) and {{lang|jbo|bangu}} (language).

== History ==
Lojban has a predecessor, [[Loglan]], a language invented by [[James Cooke Brown]] in 1955 and later developed by The Loglan Institute. Loglan was originally conceived as a means to examine the influence of language on the speaker's thought (an assumption known as the [[Linguistic relativity|Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]]).

As Brown started to claim his [[copyright]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arj.nvg.org/lojban/why-i-like.html|title=Why I like Lojban|work=nvg.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ainewsletter.com/newsletters/aix_0503.htm#loglan|title=AI Newsletter|work=ainewsletter.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the language's components, bans were put on the community's activity to stop them changing aspects of the language. In order to circumvent such control, a group of people decided to initiate a separate project, departing from the lexical basis of Loglan and reinventing the whole vocabulary, which led to the current lexicon of Lojban. In effect they established in 1987 The Logical Language Group, based in [[Washington, D.C.]] They also won a trial over whether they could call their version of the language "Loglan".&lt;ref&gt;Johansen, Arnt Richard. [http://arj.nvg.org/lojban/why-i-like.html ''Why I like Lojban''] (accessed August 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--Lojban was developed to be a [[worldlang]].  --&gt;

The phonetic form of Lojban {{lang|jbo|gismu}} (root words) was created algorithmically by searching for sound patterns in words with similar meanings in world languages and by multiplying those sound patterns by the number of speakers of those languages. The list of source languages used for the algorithm was limited to the six [[List of languages by number of native speakers|most widely spoken languages]] as of 1987—[[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], [[English language|English]], [[Hindi]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Russian language|Russian]], and [[Arabic]]. This resulted in root words being in their phonetic form a relatively equal mixture of English and Mandarin, with lesser influences from the other four.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lojban.github.io/cll/4/14/|title=The Shape Of Words To Come: Lojban Morphology - The Lojban Reference Grammar|website=lojban.github.io}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mw.lojban.org/papri/me_lu_ju'i_lobypli_li'u_13_moi|title=me lu ju'i lobypli li'u 13 moi - La Lojban|website=mw.lojban.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mw.lojban.org/papri/me_lu_ju'i_lobypli_li'u_14_moi|title=me lu ju'i lobypli li'u 14 moi - La Lojban|website=mw.lojban.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lojban has also taken the set of evidential indicators from the constructed language [[Láadan]].&lt;ref&gt;Cowan, John. [https://lojban.github.io/cll/13/11/ The Complete Lojban Language 13.11]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the publication of ''The Complete Lojban Language'', it was expected that "the documented lexicon would be baselined, and the combination of lexicon and reference grammar would be frozen for a minimum of 5 years while language usage grew."&lt;ref&gt;[https://mw.lojban.org/papri/Official_Baseline_Statement_(2002/2003) ''Official Baseline Statement'']. lojban.org&lt;/ref&gt; As scheduled, this period, which has officially been called the "freeze", expired in 2002. The speakers of Lojban are now free to construct new words and idioms, and decide where the language is heading.

==Applications==
While the initial aim of the Loglan project was to investigate [[linguistic relativity]], the active Lojban community recognizes additional applications for the language, including but not limited to:
* Improved human-human communication, due to the logical and unambiguous structure and greater means of expression (use as a speakable language)
** Eliminating ambiguity in language
* Use as an [[education|educational tool]]
* Research in [[artificial intelligence|artificial intelligence and machine understanding]]
** Improved human-computer communication, [[ontology (information science)|storage ontologies]], and [[machine translation|computer translation of natural language text]]
* Research in [[linguistics]]
* Use as an academic language, such as in science or philosophy
&lt;!--* Official language of The United People of Earth (UPE)--&gt;&lt;!--Note that these goals are not crucial to the Lojban community, most of whom simply want to enjoy communicating with each other in Lojban.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}--&gt;

===Lojban as a speakable language===
Lojban is practiced by its speakers in text&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lojban.org/resources/irclog/|title=Index of /resources/irclog|website=www.lojban.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and voice&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mw.lojban.org/papri/Recordings_of_live_Lojban_discussions|title=Recordings of live Lojban discussions - La Lojban|website=mw.lojban.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; chats.

==== Learning aids ====
Apart from the actual practice of the language, some members of the community and LLG have been endeavoring to create various aids for the learners. ''The Complete Lojban Language'' (''CLL'', also known as ''The Red Book'' because of its color, and ''The Codex Woldemar'', after its author), the definitive word on all aspects of Lojban, is one of them, finalized in 1997.

Currently, Lojban's learning resources available on the internet are available mainly to speakers of English, French, Spanish, Russian, Hebrew, and Esperanto, to varying degrees.&lt;ref&gt;[https://mw.lojban.org/papri/Learning Lojban materials in other languages] (accessed September 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lojban as a literary and cultural language===
Like most languages with few speakers, Lojban lacks much of an associated body of [[literature]] and its creative extensions have not been fully realized (the true potential of its attitudinal system, for example, is considered unlikely to be drawn out "until and unless we have children raised entirely in a multi-cultural Lojban-speaking environment"&lt;ref&gt;Cowan, John. [https://lojban.github.io/cll/ The Complete Lojban Language 13.16]&lt;/ref&gt;). Also such collective or encyclopedic sources of knowledge like the [[:jbo:|Lojban Wikipedia]], which may help expand the language's lexical horizon, are not very well developed.

Presently accessible Lojbanic writings are principally concentrated on Lojban.org,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mw.lojban.org/papri/te_gerna_la_lojban|title=te gerna la lojban - La Lojban|website=mw.lojban.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; though there exist independent Lojbanic blog/journal sites as well. The Lojban IRC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mw.lojban.org/extensions/ilmentufa/irci/|title=Page Redirection|website=mw.lojban.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; (or its archive&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lojban.org/resources/irclog/|title=Index of /resources/irclog|website=www.lojban.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;) has a gathering of Lojbanic expressions too, but its grammatical correctness is not always guaranteed. These available materials on the internet include both original works and translations of classic pieces in the field of natural languages, ranging from [[poetry]], [[short story]], [[novel]], and [[essay|academic writing]]. &lt;!-- This has been paralleled with a [[chrestomathy]] project aiming to produce a collection of translated writings in order to show wide samplings of various language, hopefully longer than {{formatnum:10000}} words and with a variety of genres and styles&lt;ref&gt;Lojban.org [https://mw.lojban.org/papri/official_LLG_Projects Official LLG Projects: Chrestomathy] (accessed August 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; (''see also – External link: Literature''). --&gt; Examples of works that are already available include:
* ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mw.lojban.org/papri/lo_selfri_be_la_.alis._bei_bu%27u_la_selmacygu%27e|title=lo selfri be la .alis. bei bu'u la selmacygu'e|website=alis.lojban.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mw.lojban.org/papri/lo_se_manci_te_makfa_pe_la_.oz.|title=lo se manci te makfa pe la .oz. - La Lojban|website=mw.lojban.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''The [[Book of Esther]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mw.lojban.org/papri/Esther|title=Esther - La Lojban|website=mw.lojban.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lojban has also been used in other media. For example, the videogame ''[[Minecraft]]'' has been partially translated into Lojban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mw.lojban.org/papri/Lojbanic_Software|title=Lojbanic Software - La Lojban|website=mw.lojban.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://crowdin.com/project/minecraft|title=Minecraft — Translation Project on Crowdin|website=Crowdin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lojban as a means of creativity===
Lojban is seen by some as an intellectual device for [[creative writing]] or as having many potential aspects yet to be discovered or explored.&lt;!--{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}--&gt;

{{quotation
|
Dan Parmenter:&lt;br /&gt;
The removal of grammatical ambiguity from modification [...] seems to heighten creative exploration of word combination. [...] Other areas of possible benefit are (surprisingly in a 'logical' language) emotional expression. Lojban has a fully developed set of metalinguistic and emotional attitude indicators that supplant much of the baggage of aspect and mood found in natural languages, but most clearly separate indicative statements from the emotional communication associated with those statements. This might lead to freer expression and consideration of ideas, since stating an idea can be distinguished from supporting that idea. The set of possible indicators is also large enough to provide specificity and clarity of emotions that is difficult in natural languages.

&lt;br /&gt;
[[John W. Cowan|John Cowan]]:&lt;br /&gt;
There is a marker for "figurative speech" which would be used on "back stabber" and would signal "There is a culturally dependent construction here!" The intent is not that everything is instantly and perfectly comprehensible to someone who knows only the root words, but rather that non-root words are built up creatively from the roots. Thus "heart pain" would refer to the literal heart and literal pain;
what would be ambiguous would be the exact connection between these two. Is the
pain in the heart, because of the heart, or what? But "heart pain" would not be
a valid tanru for "emotional pain", absent the figurative speech marker.

The language was built to attempt to remove some limits on human thought; these limits are not understood, so that the tendency is to try to remove restrictions whenever we find the language structure gets in our way. You definitely can talk nonsense in Lojban.&lt;br /&gt;

Bob LeChevalier:&lt;br /&gt;

In Lojban, a little grammar makes for a lot of semantic fun, since the grammar doesn't interfere with the semantic quibble you love. [...] In addition to its grammar, Lojban is definitely a priori in its words[...] We presume that everything can be covered as compounds of the classification scheme implied by the {{lang|jbo|gismu}} ''[root words]''. [...] We haven't, though, tried to impose a system on the universe like most a priori languages have. Instead, we have tried to broaden {{lang|jbo|gismu}} flexibility so that multiple approaches to classifying the universe are possible. Our rule is that any word have one meaning, not that any meaning have one word. There is no 'proper' classification scheme in Lojban. [...] Lojban offers a new world of thought.

==Linguistic properties==
Lojban:
* &lt;!-- has a grammar that is based on [[predicate logic]], --&gt;is designed to express complex logical constructs precisely.
* has no irregularities or ambiguities in spelling and grammar (although word derivation relies on arbitrary variant forms). This gives rise to high intelligibility for [[parsing|computer parsing]].
* is designed to be as culturally neutral as possible.
* allows highly [[second-language acquisition|systematic learning]] and use, compared to most natural languages.
* possesses an intricate system of indicators which effectively communicate contextual [[attitude (psychology)|attitude]] or [[emotion]]s.&lt;!--* It does not have [[simplicity]] as a design criterion.--&gt;

=== Grammar ===
{{Main article| Lojban grammar}}

=== Phonology and orthography ===

[[File:Lojban Lords Prayer.ogg|thumb|The [[Lord's Prayer]] in Lojban]]

Lojban has 6 [[vowel]]s and 17 [[consonant]]s. Some of them have, apart from the preferred/standard sounds, permitted variants intended to cover dissimilitude in pronunciation by speakers of different linguistic backgrounds.

Stress normally falls on the penultimate syllable.

There are 16 [[diphthong]]s (and no [[triphthong]]s). A distinction between diphthongs and monophthongs can be written by inserting a comma in the Latin alphabet. Vowel hiatus is also prevented by inserting an apostrophe, which usually indicates {{IPA|[h]}}, though there are other valid realizations. For those who have trouble pronouncing certain [[consonant cluster]]s, there is the option of adding vowels between them ([[epenthesis]]), as long as they differ sufficiently from the phonological vowels and are pronounced as short as possible. The resulting additional syllables are not factored in the grammar, including for the purposes of stress determination.

Lojban is written almost entirely with lower-case letters; upper-case letters are used to mark stress in words that do not fit the normal rules of stress assignment, or when whitespace is omitted.

The letters in Lojban and their respective pronunciations are shown in the table below. The [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] symbols in parentheses indicate alternative pronunciations; preferred pronunciations have no parentheses.

In principle, Lojban may be written in any orthographic system as long as it satisfies the required regularities and unambiguities. Some of the reasons for such elasticity would be as follows:
# Lojban is defined by the [[phoneme]]s rather than graphemes; as long as they are correctly rendered so as to maintain the Lojbanic audio-visual [[isomorphism]], a representational system can be said to be an appropriate orthography of the language;
# Lojban is meant to be as culturally neutral as possible, so it is never crucial or fundamental to claim that some particular orthography of some particular languages (e.g. the Latin alphabet) should be the dominant mode.

Some Lojbanists extend this principle to claim that even an original orthography of the language is to be sought.&lt;ref&gt;Kena. [http://vodka-pomme.net/projects/tengwar-for-lojban/write#lojban ''Vodka-Pomme: Considerations on writing: The case of lojban''] (accessed August 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

This article uses the common Latin alphabet mode.

=== Morphology ===
Lojban has three [[parts of speech|word-classes]]: predicate words ({{lang|jbo|brivla}}), structure words ({{lang|jbo|cmavo}}), and name words ({{lang|jbo|cmevla}}). Each of them has uniquely identifying properties, so that one can unambiguously recognize which word is of which part of speech in a string of the language. They may be further divided in sub-classes. There also exists a special fragmental form assigned to some predicate words and structure words, from which compound words ({{lang|jbo|lujvo}}) may be created.&lt;ref&gt;Cowan, John Woldemar. [https://mw.lojban.org/papri/the_Lojban_Reference_Grammar  ''The Complete Lojban Language: 4.1]'' (accessed August 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas, Nick, and John Cowan. [http://lojban.org/publications/level0/brochure/morphol.html  ''What is Lojban?: 2.2''] (accessed August 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Syntax and semantics ===
The language's grammatical structures are "defined by a set of rules that have been tested to be unambiguous using computers", which is in effect called the "machine grammar".&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas, Nick. John Cowan. [http://lojban.org/publications/level0/brochure/grammar.html ''What Is Lojban? II.3'']&lt;/ref&gt; Hence the characteristics of the standard syntactic (not semantic) constructs in Lojban:
* each word has exactly one grammatical interpretation;
* the words relate grammatically to each other in exactly one way.

Such standards, however, are to be attained with certain carefulness:

{{quotation
|It is important to note that new Lojbanists will not be able to speak 'perfectly' when first learning Lojban. In fact, you may never speak perfectly in 'natural' Lojban conversation, even though you achieve fluency in the language. No English speaker always speaks textbook English in natural conversation; Lojban speakers will also make grammatical errors when talking quickly. Lojbanists will, however, be able to speak or write unambiguously if they are careful, which is difficult if not impossible with a natural language.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nick Nicholas and John Cowan. '[http://lojban.org/publications/level0/brochure/grammar.html ''What Is Lojban? II.3'']}}

The computer-tested, unambiguous rules also include grammar for 'incomplete' sentences e.g. for narrative, quotational, or mathematical phrases.

Its [[Linguistic typology|typology]] can be said to be basically [[subject–verb–object]] and [[subject–object–verb]]. However, it can practically be anything:
* {{lang|jbo|mi prami do}} (SVO) (I love you)
* {{lang|jbo|mi do prami}} (SOV) (By me, you are loved)
* {{lang|jbo|do se prami mi}} (OVS) (You are loved by me)
* {{lang|jbo|do mi se prami}} (OSV) (You, I love)
* {{lang|jbo|prami fa mi do}} (VSO) (Loved by me, you are)
* {{lang|jbo|prami do fa mi}}, {{lang|jbo|se prami fa do mi}} (VOS) (Love you, I do)

Such flexibility has to do with the language's intended capability to translate as many expressions of natural languages as possible, based on a unique positional case system. The meaning of the sentence {{lang|jbo|mi prami do}} is determined by {{lang|jbo|prami}} realizing, with its own predefined "place structure", a specific semantic relation between {{lang|jbo|mi}} and {{lang|jbo|do}}; when the positional relation between {{lang|jbo|mi}} and {{lang|jbo|do}} changes, the meaning of the sentence changes too. As shown above, Lojban has particular devices to preserve such semantic structure of words while altering their order.

As befits a logical language, there is a large assortment of logical connectives. Such conjunction words take different forms depending on what they connect, another reason why the (standard) Lojbanic expressions are typically precise and clear.

Multiple predicate words may be linked up together so as to narrow the semantic scope of the phrase. In {{lang|jbo|sutra dansu}} "to quickly dance", the modifying word {{lang|jbo|sutra}} narrows the sense of the modified word {{lang|jbo|dansu}} to form a more specific concept (in which case the modifier may resemble English adverbs or adjectives).
&lt;!--
* '''English:''' ''Several small fires were burning in the house''.
* '''Lojban:''' {{lang|jbo|so'i cmalu fagri puca'o jelca ne'i le zdani}}
* '''[[Gloss (annotation)|Gloss]]:''' ''many small fire past-continuing burn inside the house'' (Translation after English)
--&gt;
One could go still further, adding a quite extreme example of its syntactic flexibility.

Lojban can easily "imitate" even one-word sentences from [[polysynthetic language]]s, for example:

* '''[[Nuu-chah-nulth language]]''': ''inkiwihl'minik'isit''
* '''[[Gloss (annotation)|Gloss]]''': ''inkiw (fire/burn) -ihl (in-the-house) -'minik (plural) -'is (diminutive) -'it (past-tense)''

which can be expressed in Lojban the same way:

* '''Lojban:''' {{lang|jbo|fagykemyzdanerso'icmapru}}
* '''Gloss:''' ''fire-type-house-inside-many-small-past-event''

===Lexicon===
Compound words ({{lang|jbo|lujvo}}) and borrowed words ({{lang|jbo|fu'ivla}}) are continually increasing as the speakers find demands. The number of root words ({{lang|jbo|gismu}}) and structure words ({{lang|jbo|cmavo}}) are basically unchanging, but new inventions are to be accepted as experimental components. In fact, it has been noticed that particular inclination or disproportion exists in the available vocabulary. Cortesi&lt;ref&gt;Cortesi, David. [http://nuzban.wiw.org/archive/9110/msg00109.html Lack of Geometry]&lt;/ref&gt; has pointed out the lack of certain terms for mathematics and geometry (although this demand may now be disputed as the current set of Lojban vocabulary does actually allow speakers to express such notions as steradian ({{lang|jbo|stero}}), trigonometric tangent ({{lang|jbo|tanjo}}), multiplicative inverse ({{lang|jbo|fa'i}}), matrix transpose ({{lang|jbo|re'a}}) among a number of other kinds of operators or metric units). Other instances which require speakers to construct noncanonical words:
* There are few entries of African country names on the official list of root words while other country names (especially those with large populations of speakers of the six source languages) are covered to a remarkable extent.
* Such distinction as between {{lang|jbo|palne}} (tray) and {{lang|jbo|palta}} (plate) exist while no distinction between "illustration" and "photography" is made by the available set of {{lang|jbo|gismu}} (that is, no exclusive root word for "photography" exists except the generic {{lang|jbo|pixra}} (picture) (''see also – Grammar: Morphology: {{lang|jbo|brivla}}: {{lang|jbo|gismu}}'').

=== The Logfest ===
Gatherings of Lojbanists have been organized in USA annually since as early as 1990, called Logfest. It is mostly informal, taking place on a weekend, with the only scheduled activity being the annual meeting of the LLG. Those who cannot be present may still be involved via IRC. Activities may be whatever the attendees want to do: Lojban conversation, lessons, technical discussions, or socializing.

=== Population ===
&lt;!--Disproportion in the community population is still noticeable. It is hoped among Lojbanists that more people from different cultural/linguistic backgrounds join the community in order to maintain and further complement the intended neutrality of the language.{{Citation needed|date = August 2015}}--&gt;

The total number of Lojban speakers is unknown.

== Comparison with other logical languages ==

=== Loglan ===
{{Main article| Comparison between Lojban and Loglan}}
The principal difference between Lojban and Loglan is one of lexicon. The words for Lojban were made by the same principles as those for Loglan; that is, candidate forms were chosen according to how many sounds they had in common with their equivalent in some of the most commonly spoken languages on Earth, which was then multiplied by the number of speakers of the languages with which the words had letters in common. The difference with the Lojban remake of the root words was that the weighting was updated to reflect the actual numbers of speakers for the languages. This resulted in word forms that had fewer sounds taken from English, and more sounds taken from Chinese. For instance, the Loglan word ''norma'' is equivalent to the Lojban word {{lang|jbo|cnano}} (cf. [[Chinese language|Chinese]] 常, [[pinyin]] ''cháng''), both meaning "normal".

Loglan and Lojban still have essentially the same grammars, and most of what is said in the [[#Grammar|Grammar]] section above holds true for Loglan as well. Most simple, declarative sentences could be translated word by
word between the two languages.

In the new phonology for Lojban, the consonant ''q'' and the vowel ''w'' were removed, and the consonant ''h'' was replaced by ''x''. The consonant ' ([[apostrophe]]) was added with the value of [h] in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], but its distribution is such that it can appear only intervocally, and in discussions of the morphology and phonotactics, it is described not as a proper consonant, but a "voiceless glide". (This phoneme is realized as [θ] by some speakers.)

=== gua\spi ===
{{lang|mis|gua\spi}} is a descendent of Loglan but is [[tonal language|tonal]], developed by Jim Carter. Instead of structure words there are in {{lang|mis|Gua\spi}} six different tones. Predicates have only one syllable instead of two. Some of its characteristics, including tones, phonotactics, expressions for masses vs sets, non-existence of metalinguistic negation, etc., received criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mw.lojban.org/papri/critique_of_gua%5Cspi|title=critique of gua\spi|work=lojban.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lunfardo''' (from the Italian ''lumbardo'' (it is not proven) or inhabitant of [[Lombardy]] in the local dialect) is a [[dialect]] originated and developed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in the lower classes in [[Buenos Aires]] and from there spread to other cities nearby, such as the surrounding area [[Greater Buenos Aires]], [[Rosario]] and [[Montevideo]]. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agenciaelvigia.com.ar/historia_del_lunfardo.htm Lunfardo history, with historical accounts in newspapers of the nineteenth century.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://buscon.rae.es/draeI/SrvltConsulta?TIPO_BUS=3&amp;LEMA=lunfardo Definition of the word "Lunfardo"according to the RAE.]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Originally, Lunfardo was a slang used by criminals and soon by other people of the lower and lower-middle classes. Later, many of its words and phrases were introduced in the vernacular and disseminated the [[Rioplatense Spanish|Spanish]] of [[Argentina]], and [[Uruguay]]. Nevertheless, since the early 20th century, Lunfardo has spread among all social strata and classes by habitual use or because it was common in the lyrics of [[tango music|tango]].

==Origin==
Lunfardo (or ''lunfa'' for short) began as prison slang in the late 19th century so guards would not understand prisoners. According to Oscar Conde, the word came from "lumbardo" (the inhabitants of the region [[Lombardia]] in [[Italy]], the origin of most of the Italians in Argentina in the early 19th century).&lt;ref&gt;Conde. "Un estudio sobre el habla popular de los argentinos". Introduction&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the vernacular Spanish of mid-19th century Buenos Aires as preserved in the dialogue of [[Esteban Echeverría|Esteban Echeverría's]] short story [[The Slaughter Yard]] (El matadero) is already a prototype of Lunfardo.&lt;ref&gt;The story may be read on Wikisource: https://es.wikisource.org/wiki/El_Matadero.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==

Most sources believe that Lunfardo originated among criminals, and later became more commonly used by other classes. Circa 1870, the word ''lunfardo'' itself (originally a deformation of ''[[Lombard language|lombardo]]'' in several Italian dialects) was often used to mean "outlaw".

==Lunfardo today==
Today, some Lunfardo terms have entered in the language spoken all over Argentina and Uruguay, although a great number of Lunfardo words have fallen into disuse or have been modified in the era of [[suburbanization]]. Furthermore, the term "Lunfardo" has become synonymous with "speech of Buenos Aires" or "Porteño", mainly of the inhabitants of the [[City of Buenos Aires]], as well as its surrounding areas, [[Greater Buenos Aires]]. The Montevideo speech has almost as much "lunfardo slang" as the Buenos Aires speech. Conde says the lunfardo (much like the [[cocoliche]]) can be considered a kind of Italian dialect mixed with Spanish words, specifically the one spoken in [[Montevideo]].  In other words, the lunfardo is an ''interlanguage variety'' of the Italian dialects spoken by immigrants in the areas of Buenos Aires and Montevideo.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

In [[Argentina]], any [[neologism]] that reached a minimum level of acceptance is considered, by default, a Lunfardo term. The original slang has been immortalized in numerous [[tango music|tango]] lyrics.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Conde has expressed that the Lunfardo is not so much a dialect but a kind of local language of the Italian immigrants, mixed with Spanish and some French words.&lt;ref&gt;Oscar Conde: Lunfardo. Un estudio sobre el habla popular de los argentinos; pág. 43&lt;/ref&gt; He believes that Lunfardo is not a criminal slang, since most of the lunfardo words are not related to crime.&lt;ref&gt;Conde; p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Conde, Lunfardo

{{Quote|...is a vernacular, or to put it more clearly, is a vocabulary of popular speech in Buenos Aires that spread first throughout the  River Plate area and later to the whole country ... The use of this lexicon reminds speakers of their identity but also of their roots... lunfardo is possibly the only argot that was originally formed, and in great measure, from Italian immigrant terms.  [''Es un modo de expresión popular o, para decirlo más claramente, un vocabulario del habla popular de Buenos Aires…que se ha extendido primero a toda la región del Río de la Plata y luego al país entero…el uso de este léxico les recuerda a sus usuarios quiénes son, pero también de dónde vienen…el lunfardo es posiblemente el único que en su origen se formó, y en un alto porcentaje, con términos italianos inmigrados''].&lt;ref&gt;Conde; p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Characteristics==

Lunfardo words are inserted in the normal flow of [[Rioplatense Spanish]] sentences, but grammar and pronunciation do not change. Thus, an average Spanish-speaking person reading tango lyrics will need, at most, the translation of a discrete set of words.

Tango lyrics use lunfardo sparsely, but some songs (such as ''El Ciruja'', or most lyrics by Celedonio Flores) employ lunfardo heavily. "Milonga Lunfarda" by [[Edmundo Rivero]] is an instructive and entertaining primer on lunfardo usage.

A characteristic of lunfardo is its use of [[word play]], notably ''[[vesre]]'' (from "[al] revés"), reversing the syllables, similar to English [[back slang]], French [[verlan]] or Greek [[ποδανά|podaná]]. Thus, ''tango'' becomes ''gotán'' and ''café con leche'' (coffee with milk) becomes ''feca con chele''.

Lunfardo employs metaphors such as ''bobo'' ("dumb") for the [[heart]], who "works all day long without being paid" or ''bufoso'' ("snorter") for [[pistol]].

Finally, there are words that are derived from others in Spanish, such as the verb ''abarajar'', which means to stop a situation or a person (such as ''to stop your opponent's blows with the blade of your knife'') and is related to the verb "barajar", which means to cut or shuffle a deck of cards.

==Examples==

===Nouns===
* ''buchón'' - snitch, informer to the law (from the Spanish ''[[wikt:buche#Spanish|buche]]'' a buchón is a type of dove)
* ''chochamu'' - young man (''vesre'' for ''muchacho'')
* ''fiaca'' - laziness, or lazy person (from the Italian ''fiacca'' "laziness, sluggishness")
* ''gomías'' - friends (''vesre'' for ''amigos'')
* ''guita'' - money
* ''gurí'' - boy, more recently used for young teenagers.
* ''gurisa'' - female for "gurí"
* ''lorca'' - hot, as in the weather (''vesre'' for ''calor'' "heat")
* ''luca'' - 1000 pesos
* ''mango'' - an Argentine peso
* ''mina'' - an informal word for woman, from the Italian ''femmina''
* ''percanta'' - a young woman
* ''pibe''&lt;ref&gt;[http://buscon.rae.es/draeI/SrvltGUIBusUsual?LEMA=pibe pibe] in the [[Diccionario de la Real Academia Española]]&lt;/ref&gt; - like "kid", a common term for boy or, in more recent times, for young man
* ''quilombo'' - racket, ruckus, mess; also slang for brothel (from the [[Kimbundu]] word ''kilombo'', a [[quilombo|Maroon settlement]]).

===Verbs===
* ''cerebrar'' - to think something up (from ''cerebro'', "brain")
* ''engrupir'' - to fool someone (maybe from [[Italian language|Italian]] ''ingroppare'' "to fuck", but also used in modern European and Brazilian [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] slang)
* ''garpar'' - to pay with money (''vesre'' for ''pagar'' "to pay")
* ''junar'' - to look to / to know (from [[Caló (Spanish Romani)|Caló]] ''junar'' "to hear")
* ''laburar'' - to work (from [[Italian language|Italian]] ''lavorare'' "to work")
* ''manyar'' - to know / to eat (from the [[Italian language|Italian]] ''mangiare'' "to eat")
* ''morfar'' - to eat (from [[French language|French]] argot ''morfer'' "to eat")
* ''pescar'' - to know (''vesre'' from the Italian ''capisce'' "do you understand?")

==Modern slang==

Since the 1970s, it is a matter of debate whether newer additions to the slang of Buenos Aires qualify as lunfardo.  Traditionalists argue that lunfardo ''must'' have a link to the argot of the old underworld, to tango lyrics, or to racetrack slang. Others maintain that the colloquial language of Buenos Aires is lunfardo by definition.

Some examples of modern talk:

* ''Gomas'' (lit. ''tires'') - woman's breasts
* ''Maza'' (lit. ''mace'' or ''sledgehammer'') - superb
* ''Curtir'' (lit. ''to tan'') - to be involved in
* ''Curtir fierros'' can mean "to be into car mechanics" or "to be into firearms", ''Fierro'' is the Old Spanish form of ''hierro'' (iron). In Argentine parlance, it can mean a firearm or anything related to metals and mechanics, for example a racing car.
* ''Zafar'' - to barely get by; Zafar is actually a standard Spanish verb (originally meaning ''to extricate oneself'') that had fallen out of use and was restored to everyday Buenos Aires speech in the 1970s by students, with the meaning of "barely passing (an examination)"
* ''Trucho'' - counterfeit, fake; Trucho is from old Spanish slang ''truchamán'', which in turn derives from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''turjeman'' ("translator", referring specifically to a person who accosts foreigners and lures them into [[tourist trap]]s). [[Folk etymology]] derives this word from ''trucha'' ([[trout]]), or from the Italian ''[[wikt:trucco|trucco]]'', something made fake on purpose. [http://www.libertaddigital.com/php3/opi_desa.php3?cpn=22645 Reference (Spanish)]

Many new terms had spread from specific areas of the dynamic Buenos Aires cultural scene: invented by screenwriters, used around the arts-and-crafts fair in Plaza Francia, culled from the vocabulary of [[psychoanalysis]].

==Influence from [[Cocoliche]]==
Lunfardo was influenced by Cocoliche, a dialect of [[Italian Argentine|Italian immigrants]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cvc.cervantes.es/literatura/aispi/pdf/14/14_073.pdf  Cocoliche e Lunfardo: l'italiano dell'Argentina (in Italian).] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160222045910/http://cvc.cervantes.es/literatura/aispi/pdf/14/14_073.pdf |date=2016-02-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many  [[cocoliche]] words were transferred to Lunfardo in the first half of the 20th century. For example:-
* ''manyar'' (to eat) from [[Venetian language|Venetian]] and [[Lombard language|Lombard]] "magnar" (''mangiare'' in Italian) 
* ''lonyipietro'' (fool)
* ''fungi'' (mushroom) -&gt; in Lunfardo: hat
* ''vento'' (wind) -&gt; in Lunfardo: money
* ''matina'' (morning) from Italian "mattina"
* ''mina'' (girl) from [[Lombard language|Lombard]] "mina" (''busty woman'' or ''prostitute'') 
* ''laburar'' (to work) from Italian "lavorare"
* ''minga'' (nothing) from [[Lombard language|Lombard]] "minga" (negative particle like ''not'' in English or ''ne pas'' in French)
* ''yeta'' (bad luck) from [[Neapolitan language|Neapolitan]] "[[wikt:iettatore|iettatore]]"
* ''yira'' (to go for a walk) from Italian "girare"
* ''salute'' (cheers) from Italian "salute"
* ''fiaca'' (laziness) from Italian "fiacca"

Some Italian linguists,&lt;ref&gt;A. Cancellier. ''Italiano e spagnolo a contatto nel Rio de La Plata'' Università di Milano. Milano, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; because of the Cocoliche influences, argue that the Lunfardo can be considered a ''[[pidgin]]'' of the [[Italian language]].

==Suffixes==

A rarer feature of Porteño speech that can make it completely unintelligible is the random addition of suffixes with no particular meaning, usually making common words sound reminiscent of Italian surnames. These endings include -''etti'', -''elli'' ''eli'', -''oni'', -''eni'', -''anga'', -''ango'', -''enga'', -''engue'', -''engo'', -''ingui'', -''ongo'', -''usi'', -''ula'', -''usa'', -''eta'', among others.

'''Marau Wawa''' is an extinct language once spoken on [[Marau Island]], off [[Makira]] in the [[Solomon Islands]].  (The island was actually named ''Wawa''; ''marau'' just means "island".)  The last speaker was old in 1919; the island had been abandoned after a raid some years earlier.  The language may have been one of the [[Makira languages]], but it was quite distinct.&lt;ref&gt;Sidney Ray (1926), ''A Comparative Study of the Melanesian Island Languages'', CUP, pp. 471–472.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Michaelmas term''' is the first [[academic term]] of the academic year in a number of [[English language|English]]-speaking universities and schools in the northern hemisphere, especially in the [[United Kingdom]].  Michaelmas term derives its name from [[Michaelmas|the Feast of St Michael and All Angels]], which falls on 29 September. The term runs from September or October to [[Christmas]].

==The legal year==
The term is also the name of the first of four terms into which the [[legal year]] is divided by the [[Courts of England and Wales]] and the [[Courts of Northern Ireland]]. While the name is not used in the legal systems of the United States, where most American courts operate on continuous year-round calendars without terms, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] roughly follows the English custom by beginning its annual nine-month term on the first Monday in October, a few days after Michaelmas.

==Universities==
Universities in the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[Republic of Ireland]] which use the name 'Michaelmas term' as of July 2018 include:

*[[University of Cambridge]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cam.ac.uk/about-the-university/term-dates-and-calendars|title=Term dates and calendars|publisher=University of Cambridge|accessdate=28 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the name is used unofficially in several other University of London colleges.  It also used to be the third and final term at the [[University of Sydney]] before it swapped over to the two-[[semester]] system in 1989. It was formerly used at [[Aberystwyth University]], [[Heythrop College]], [[King's College London]] and
[[University of Wales, Lampeter]]. 

At the University of Oxford, following the resolution made by Council on 8 May 2002, Michaelmas Term begins on and includes 1 October and ends on and includes 17 December.&lt;ref name="Oxford Regs"&gt;[http://www.admin.ox.ac.uk/examregs/03-00_REGULATIONS_ON_THE_NUMBER_AND_LENGTH_OF_TERMS.shtml Oxford University: Regulations on the number and lengths of terms] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527150600/http://www.admin.ox.ac.uk/examregs/03-00_REGULATIONS_ON_THE_NUMBER_AND_LENGTH_OF_TERMS.shtml |date=2008-05-27 }}, University of Oxford, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Michaelmas Term, as in [[Hilary Term]] and in [[Trinity Term]], there is a period of eight weeks known as Full Term, beginning on a Sunday, within which lectures and other instruction prescribed by statute or regulation are given.&lt;ref name="Oxford Regs"/&gt; The dates on which each Full Term will begin and end in the next academic year but one are published by the Registrar in the University Gazette during each Hilary Term.&lt;ref name="Oxford Regs"/&gt;

'''Kulakunda Shiva Rao''' (15 June 1924 – 13 March 1992), popularly known as '''Niranjana''', was a [[Kannada language|Kannada]] playwright, novelist and a freedom fighter.&lt;ref name="Lal2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mohan Lal|title=The Encyclopaedia Of Indian Literature (Volume Five (Sasay To Zorgot)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KnPoYxrRfc0C&amp;pg=PA4048|date=1 January 2006|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|isbn=978-81-260-1221-3|pages=4048–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Niranjana1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=A.

== Writing career ==
Niranjana wrote more than sixty books.{{Citation needed|date= June 2018}} His first published novel was ''Vimochane'' (''Wait for the moon'') published in 1953. Some of his other notable works are— ''Chirasmarane'', and ''Mrityunjaya''. He also edited Kannada translation of ''Vishwa Katha Kosha'' (''A Treasury of World Short Stories'').&lt;ref name=Niranjana1995 /&gt; He also translated a number of works into Kannada language.&lt;ref name="BassnettEditor)2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Susan Bassnett|author2=Susan Bassnett (S Editor)|author3=Harish Trivedi|title=Postcolonial Translation: Theory and Practice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K8YJkxXSKnIC&amp;pg=PA179|date=12 October 2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-75498-4|pages=179–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Niranjana was attracted to marxism during his youth and was an active member of the [[Communist Party of India]].{{Citation needed|date= June 2018}} He became disillusioned later and left it but still continued to raise his voice for the downtrodden and oppressed through his writings. He suffered a stroke in 1971 when he was at his zenith of writing career. He wrote ''Mrityunjaya'' in 1976. ''Chirasmarane'' is based on the historic [[Kayyur]] incident of the 1940s in Kasaragod district where peasants rose against local landlords.

He edited ''Vishwa Katha Kosha'', a 25-volume work which made stories from around the world available in Kannada and also worked as an editor to bring out the ''Kannada Jnana Kosha''.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

Niranjana married Venkata Lakshmi, who later become a writer (with the pen name [[Anupama Niranjana]]).{{Citation needed|date= June 2018}} They have two daughters, Seemanthini and Tejaswini. His wife died of cancer in 1991. Niranjana died a year later, on 13 March 1992 in [[Hyderabad]], due to illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Niranjana dead|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=aZBlAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=lJ4NAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2464%2C2536074|newspaper=The Indian Express|accessdate=26 April 2017|page=1|date=14 March 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Millican later obtained his PhD with a thesis on [[David Hume|Hume]], [[Inductive reasoning|Induction]] and [[Probability]], and also a research MSc in [[Computer Science]], while employed at [[University of Leeds|Leeds]].&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;[http://www.millican.org/about.htm "Peter Millican-About Me"], 2 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic career ==
After teaching at the [[University of Glasgow]] from 1983, Millican was appointed in 1985 to a permanent Lectureship at [[Leeds University]], teaching both [[Computing]] and Philosophy. After 20 years at Leeds, in 2005 Millican was appointed as Gilbert Ryle Fellow in Philosophy at [[Hertford College]], [[Oxford]], promoted to Reader in Early Modern Philosophy in 2007, and Professor of Philosophy in 2010.&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt; In 2009, he was appointed as the first "David Hume Illumni Fellow" at [[Edinburgh University]], a visiting position that he occupied during 2010–11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=University of Edinburgh|url=http://www.philosophy.ed.ac.uk/news_and_events/article.php?article_id=69|date=28 April 2009|title=News: Millican Appointed Illumni Hume Fellow}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research===
Millican is best known for his research on [[David Hume]], notably on the development of Hume's philosophy, and on the interpretation of his writings on induction and causation. In a 1995 paper,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Routledge|url=http://www.davidhume.org/documents/1995Induction.pdf|author=Peter Millican|year=1995|title=Hume's Argument Concerning Induction: Structure and Interpretation|access-date=12 November 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107030148/http://www.davidhume.org/documents/1995Induction.pdf#|archive-date=7 January 2009|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Millican gave a detailed analysis of Hume's famous argument concerning induction, aiming to reconcile its apparent sceptical thrust with Hume's clear endorsement of inductive science: the previous interpretations that he was attacking had either condemned Hume as an inconsistent sceptic, or denied the scepticism entirely. His 2002 collection included a paper refining his analysis, and arguing against recent revisionary non-sceptical interpretations (particularly those proposed by Don Garrett and David Owen)—this debate is still ongoing in his 2012 paper. The collection also emphasised the distinctive importance of Hume's work in the 1748 ''Enquiry'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Oxford University Press|url=http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Philosophy/History/18thC/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780198752103|date=May 2002|title=Reading Hume on Human Understanding}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the controversial implication that the ''Enquiry'', rather than the ''Treatise'', should be taken as presenting Hume's definitive perspective on the main topics that it covers.

Millican has published a series of substantial papers with the aim of deciding the so-called "New Hume" debate, which has been the most prominent controversy in Hume scholarship over the last 20 years ("New Humeans" take Hume to be a believer in a form of causation that goes beyond the constraints of his famous "two definitions of cause"). The first of these appeared in a 2007 collection on the debate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Routledge|url=http://www.routledge.com/books/The-New-Hume-Debate-ISBN 978-0-415-39975-3|date=12 December 2007|title=The New Hume Debate: Revised Edition}}&lt;/ref&gt; the second in the July 2009 issue of [[Mind (journal)|Mind]], and the third (responding to replies) in a 2010 collection on causation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Routledge|url=http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9780415883559/|date=8 December 2010|title=The New Hume Debate: Revised Edition}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Mind'' paper concludes that "the New Hume interpretation is not just wrong in detail—failing in the many ways documented above—but fundamentally misrepresents the basis, core, point and spirit of Hume's philosophy of causation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Oxford University Press|url=http://www.davidhume.org/documents/2008%20Hume%20on%20Causal%20Science.pdf|author=Peter Millican|year=2009|title=Hume, Causal Realism, and Causal Science}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; A reviewer of the third paper judges that "Millican convincingly argues that none of his opponents' attempts to [answer his criticisms] are plausible. I am not alone in thinking the New Hume debate has run its course; as Millican says at the end of his essay, 'it is time to call it a day' (p. 158)."

Much of Millican's other research, while not itself historical, has focused on Humean topics such as induction, probability, and philosophy of religion, but also on philosophy of language. His most significant non-Humean papers are on the logic of [[definite descriptions]] (1990), the morality of abortion (1992), and Anselm's [[Ontological Argument]] (2004).".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.millican.org/research.htm "Peter Millican-Research"], 2 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophy and computing===
As an educator, Millican's most distinctive contributions have been on the interface between Computing and Philosophy, devoting most of his career at Leeds to developing the teaching of Computer Science and programming to students in the Humanities.&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt; In 2012 he championed a new degree in Computer Science and Philosophy at Oxford University (see [[Degrees of the University of Oxford]]). 
To encourage students in the Humanities to get involved in Computing, Millican has developed a number of user-friendly software teaching systems.

===Barack Obama autobiography===
In 2008 and 2009, some Republican commentators advanced claims that US President [[Barack Obama]]'s autobiography, ''[[Dreams from My Father]]'' was written or [[ghost-writer|ghost-written]] by [[Bill Ayers]].  In a series of articles in [[American Thinker]] and [[WorldNetDaily]], author [[Jack Cashill]] claimed that his own analysis of the book showed Ayers' writing style, and backed this up citing analyses by American researchers using Millican's ''Signature'' software.  In late October 2008, shortly before the US Presidential election, [[United States Congress|US Congressman]] [[Chris Cannon]] and his brother-in-law attempted to hire Millican to prove Ayers' authorship using computer analysis.  Millican refused after they would not assure him in advance that his results would be published regardless of the outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The Sunday Times|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/us_elections/article5063279.ece?print=yes&amp;randnum=1225630963546|author=Sarah Baxter|date=2 October 2008|title=Republicans try to use Oxford don to smear Barack Obama}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[The Sunday Times]]

== Chess career ==
Millican played chess over-the-board in his youth, and captained Oxford University to victory in the National Chess Club Championship in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.millican.org/chess.htm "Peter Millican-Chess"], 13 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; He later turned to [[correspondence chess]], becoming British Champion in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bfcc-online.org.uk/british-championship/bccc-champions/ "British Champions"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110618062035/http://www.bfcc-online.org.uk/british-championship/bccc-champions |date=18 June 2011 }}, British Federation for Correspondence Chess, 13 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; This brought him the British Master title, and he then became an International Master in 1993 by winning his Semi-final group in the 19th World Correspondence Championship. With an international rating of 2610 (ranked 31 in the world), Millican was invited to play in the NPSF-50 "super tournament" (the first-ever Category 15 tournament, with an average rating over 2600).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.endgame.nl/cc.htm NPSF-50 years jubilee], Jan van Reek, 13 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; By coming fifth—after [[Ulf Andersson]], [[Gert Jan Timmerman]], [[Joop van Oosterom]], and [[:de:Hans-Marcus Elwert|Hans-Marcus Elwert]], Millican qualified in 1997 as an [[International Correspondence Chess Grandmaster]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iccf.com/downloads/titles/2007_GMplus_Norms.pdf International Grandmasters plus their GM Norms and Related Events] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090630005156/http://www.iccf.com/downloads/titles/2007_GMplus_Norms.pdf |date=30 June 2009 }}, International Correspondence Chess Federation, 12 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; He analysed the [[Muzio Gambit|Double Muzio]] [[chess opening]] in detail, asserting equality.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Millican: "[http://www.millican.org/chess/muzio.pdf The Double Muzio]", ''Correspondence Chess'' no.102, April 1989, pp. 6-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6251">'''Philoxenus of Mabbug''' ([[Syriac language|Syriac]]: {{lang|syr|ܐܟܣܢܝܐ ܡܒܘܓܝܐ}}, ''{{transl|sem|Aksenāyâ Mabûḡāyâ}}'') (died 523), also known as '''Xenaias''' and '''Philoxenus of Hierapolis''', was one of the most notable Syriac prose writers and a vehement champion of [[Miaphysitism]].

== Early life ==

He was born, probably in the third quarter of the 5th century, at [[Tahal (diocese)|Tahal]], a village in the district of [[Beth Garmaï]] east of the [[Tigris]]. He was thus by birth a subject of [[Persian Empire|Persia]], but all his active life of which we have any record was passed in the territory of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. His parents were from the Median city of Ecbatana.&lt;ref&gt;Wigram, William Ainger (1910) An introduction to the history of the Assyrian Church or the church of the Sassanid Persian Empire, 100-640 A.D., Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; The statements that he had been a slave and was never baptized appear to be malicious inventions of his theological opponents. He was educated at [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]], perhaps in the famous "school of the Persians," which was afterwards (in 489) expelled from Edessa on account of its connection with [[Nestorianism]].

== Background ==

The years which followed the [[Council of Chalcedon]] (451) were a stormy period in the [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syriac Church]]. Philoxenus soon attracted notice by his strenuous advocacy of [[Miaphysitism]].

When Calandio, the [[Chalcedonian]] patriarch of Antioch, was expelled by the Miaphysite [[Peter the Fuller]] in 485, Philoxenus was ordained bishop of [[Mabbug]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Barhebraeus]], ''Chron. eccl.'' i. 183&lt;/ref&gt; It was probably during the earlier years of his episcopate that Philoxenus composed his thirteen homilies on the Christian life.

== Syriac Bible ==
Later he devoted himself to the revision of the [[Syriac versions of the Bible]], and with the help of his [[chorepiscopus]] Polycarp produced in 508 the so-called [[Philoxenian version]], which was in some sense the received Bible of the Syriac Miaphysites during the 6th century. In the meantime he continued his ecclesiastical activity, working as a bitter opponent of [[Flavian II of Antioch|Flavian II]], who was [[List of Patriarchs of Antioch|patriarch of Antioch]] from 498 to 512 and accepted the decrees of the Council of Chalcedon.

With the support of [[Anastasius I of the Byzantine Empire|Emperor Anastasius]], the Miaphysites ousted Flavian in 512 and replaced him with their partisan [[Severus of Antioch|Severus]]. Of Philoxenus's part in the struggle we possess not too trustworthy accounts by hostile writers, such as [[Theophanes the Confessor]] and [[Theodorus Lector]]. We know that in 498 he was staying at Edessa; in or about 507, according to Theophanes, he was summoned by the emperor to [[Constantinople]]; and he finally presided at a [[synod]] at Sidon which was the means of procuring the replacement of Flavian by Severus. But the triumph was short-lived. [[Justin I]], who succeeded Anastasius in 518 and adhered to the Chalcedonian creed, exiled Severus and Philoxenus in 519. Philoxenus was banished to [[Plovdiv|Philippopolis]] in [[Thrace]], and afterwards to [[Gangra]] in [[Paphlagonia]], where he was murdered in 523.&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Philoxenus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Writings ==

Apart from his redoubtable powers as a controversialist, Philoxenus is remembered as a scholar, an elegant writer, and an exponent of practical Christianity. Of the chief monument of his scholarship&amp;nbsp;– the Philoxenian version of the Bible&amp;nbsp;– only the [[Gospels]] and certain portions of [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] are known to survive (see [[William Wright (Orientalist)|Wright]], ''Syr. Lit.'' 14). It was an attempt to provide a more accurate rendering of the [[Septuagint]] than had hitherto existed in Syriac, and obtained recognition among Syriac Miaphysites until superseded by the still more literal renderings of the [[Old Testament]] by [[Paul of Tella]] and of the [[New Testament]] by [[Thomas of Harkel]] (both in 616/617), of which the latter at least was based on the work of Philoxenus.

There are also extant portions of commentaries on the Gospels from his pen. Of the excellence of his style and of his practical religious zeal we are able to judge from the thirteen homilies on the Christian life and character which have been edited and translated by [[E. A. Wallis Budge]] (London, 1894). In these he holds aloof for the most part from theological controversy, and treats in an admirable tone and spirit the themes of faith, simplicity, the fear of [[God]], poverty, greed, abstinence and unchastity. His affinity with his earlier countryman [[Aphraates]] is manifest both in his choice of subjects and his manner of treatment. As his quotations from Scripture appear to be made from the [[Peshitta]], he probably wrote the homilies before he embarked upon the Philoxenian version. Philoxenus wrote also many controversial works and some liturgical pieces. Many of his letters survive, and at least two have been edited. Several of his writings were translated into [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Ethiopic]].

A '''robocall''' is a phone call that uses a computerized [[autodialer]] to deliver a pre-recorded message, as if from a [[robot]]. Robocalls are often associated with political and [[telemarketing]] phone campaigns, but can also be used for public-service or emergency announcements. Some robocalls use [[Personalized audio messaging|personalized audio messages]] to simulate an actual personal phone call.

===Canada===
{{Main|Robocall scandal}}

Robocalls can be and are legitimately used by mainstream political parties in Canada to reach voters. Controversy surrounded the use of robocalls during the [[Canadian federal election, 2011]], leading [[Elections Canada]] and the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] to investigate claims that robocalls were used in an attempt to dissuade voters from casting their ballot by falsely telling them their poll stations had changed locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=McGregor |first=Glen |title=Michael Sona to be sentenced Nov. 19 in robocalls affair |url=https://ottawacitizen.com/news/national/crown-seeks-increased-sentence-for-sona-over-2011-robocalls-case |website=Ottawa Citizen |publisher=Postmedia Network Inc. |accessdate=22 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elections Canada traced the origin of the automated calls to a disposable cellphone registered to a fictional name "Pierre Poutine" at a phony address from 450 [[area code]] of [[Joliette]], [[Quebec]], and issued a subpoena to the cellphone provider that produced a list of outgoing calls from the same number. One of the calls was to the toll-free number used by customers of 2call.ca, a subsidiary of [[Edmonton]]-based [[Internet Service Provider]] RackNine, to phone in and record their outgoing messages. The burner cell phone belonging to "Pierre Poutine" was used to contact the owner of Racknine at his personal unlisted number and gave the name "Pierre Jones". This burner phone initiated a series of automated robocalls mostly in Guelph but with a few dozen in other ridings, that targeted mostly non-Conservative voters with false voting location changes. Some voters attended what they had been led to believe were their voting locations, and sometimes destroyed their voter registration cards in anger.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

In November 2011, the investigator served RackNine with a production order for records and had the account holder associated with the bogus calls quickly identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Maher and McGregor |url=https://ottawacitizen.com/news/Tracking+telephone+tricks/6194759/story.html |title=Tracking telephone tricks |publisher=Ottawa Citizen |accessdate=28 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226004126/http://www.ottawacitizen.com/news/Tracking+telephone+tricks/6194759/story.html |archivedate=February 26, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Investigators have also examined the Conservative Party's CIMS voter database and showed that "Pierre Poutine" used the Conservative voter database to select who to call. Investigators have blank entries for one specific login, leading to speculation that evidence has been deleted. PayPal has also surrendered their records to investigators since "Pierre Poutine" has used a PayPal account to pay for the bill for the automated calls. The cost for these May 2, 2011, calls was $162.10, Elections Canada said in court filings. This expenditure was never reported to Elections Canada, as required for legitimate political spending.

Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]] and the [[Conservative Party of Canada]] have denied any knowledge or involvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Maher and McGregor|url=https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/robocalls-probe-centres-on-disposable-burner-cellphone-linked-to-guelph-black-ops|title=Robocalls probe centres on disposable ‘burner’ cellphone linked to black ops in Guelph riding|publisher=National Post|accessdate=28 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Conservative party staffer resigned soon after the scandal was reported but has since come forward stating that he was not involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/who-s-who-in-the-election-phone-calls-controversy-1.1128163 | title=Who's who in the election phone calls controversy | work=CBC News | date=February 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elections Canada has made a statement&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.elections.ca/content.aspx?section=med&amp;document=mar1512&amp;dir=pre&amp;lang=e |title=Elections Canada Online - News Releases and Media Advisories}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reported to Parliament,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elections.ca/content.aspx?section=med&amp;document=mar2912&amp;dir=spe&amp;lang=e|title=Elections Canada Online - Statements and Speeches|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the fraud was extensive, affecting 200 ridings in all ten provinces plus [[Yukon]] Territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/politics/article/1153879--robocall-probe-stretches-to-200-ridings-across-canada-chief-electoral-officer-marc-mayrand-tells-commons-committee | location=Toronto | work=The Star | first=Susan | last=Delacourt | title=Robocall probe stretches to 200 ridings across Canada, chief electoral officer Marc Mayrand tells Commons committee | date=March 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Council of Canadians, a left of centre activist group, has asserted that the robocalls may have been enough to swing the result by 4%, enough to win a number of ridings in very close races. A court challenge has been initiated by this group to overturn the results of the election in seven ridings, and initiate by-elections for the respective seven House of Commons seats.

After reviewing the investigation of the "Pierre Poutine" scandal in 2013, Federal Court Judge Richard Mosley found that election fraud had taken place in six ridings across the country but found no evidence that the Conservative party or candidates were involved. He also did not find sufficient evidence to support charges in ridings other than Guelph. As well, he indicated that the "robocalls" had not affected the outcome of the 2011 election in any riding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/opinion/editorials/2014/08/14/greasy_robocall_scandal_will_haunt_conservatives_at_the_polls_editorial.html|title=Greasy ‘robocall’ scandal will haunt Conservatives at the polls: Editorial|date=August 14, 2014|work=thestar.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
====Political calls====
Robocalls are made by many political parties in the United States, including but not limited to both the Republican and Democratic parties as well as unaffiliated campaigns, [[527 organization]]s, unions, and individual citizens. Political robocalls are exempt from the [[United States National Do Not Call Registry]].&lt;ref&gt;The do-not-call list restricts "telephone solicitations" and does not apply to tax-exempt nonprofit organization. 47 U.S.C. §&amp;nbsp;227(a)(3) defines "telephone solicitations"; 47 U.S.C. §&amp;nbsp;227(c) enables the do-not-call list.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=National Do Not Call Registry |url=https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0108-national-do-not-call-registry |website=Consumer Information |publisher=Federal Trade Commission |accessdate=22 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991]] (TCPA) and [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) regulations prohibit anyone (including charities, politicians and political parties) from making robocalls to cell phone numbers without the recipients' prior consent.&lt;ref&gt;47 U.S.C. §&amp;nbsp;227(b)(1)(A); there are other prohibited destinations such as hospital rooms; some calls, such as those for an emergency purpose, are permitted.&lt;/ref&gt; The FCC permits non-commercial robocalls to most residential (non-cellular) telephone lines.&lt;ref&gt;47 C.F.R. §&amp;nbsp;64.1200(a)(2) [2007] permits non-commercial and tax-exempt nonprofit calls.&lt;/ref&gt;

The federal [[Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991]] (TCPA) regulates automated calls.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/47/227- Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (TCPA)], 47 U.S.C. §&amp;nbsp;227.&lt;/ref&gt; All robocalls, irrespective of whether they are political in nature, must do two things to be considered legal. Federal law requires all telephone calls using pre-recorded messages to identify who is initiating the calls and include a telephone number or address whereby the initiator can be reached.&lt;ref&gt;47 U.S.C. §&amp;nbsp;227(d)(3); 47 C.F.R. §64.1200(b)&lt;/ref&gt;

Some states (23 according to DMNews) have laws that regulate or prohibit political robocalls.&lt;ref name="states"&gt;[http://www.dmnews.com/cms/dm-news/legal-privacy/38770.html States enforce limits on robocalls] – DMNews, "States enforce limits on robocalls"&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robocall#Indiana|Indiana]] and [[North Dakota]] prohibit automated political calls.&lt;ref name = "UPI"&gt;[http://www.upi.com/NewsTrack/view.php?StoryID=20061105-010536-9525r Phonebank accents irk congressman] – UPI, November 5, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[New Hampshire]], political robocalls are allowed, except when the recipient is in the [[United States National Do Not Call Registry|National Do Not Call Registry]].&lt;ref name="Concord Monitor"&gt;[http://www.concordmonitor.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061105/REPOSITORY/611050397 Repeat calls not from Hodes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070519052740/http://www.concordmonitor.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20061105%2FREPOSITORY%2F611050397 |date=May 19, 2007 }} – [[Concord Monitor]], November 5, 2006. "Repeat calls not from Hodes"&lt;/ref&gt; Many states require the disclosure of who paid for the call, often requiring such notice be recorded in the candidate's own voice. The patch-work of state laws regulating political robocalls has created problems for national campaigns.&lt;ref name = "Regulating Robocalls"&gt;[http://ssrn.com/abstract=1309780 Regulating Robocalls: Are Automated Calls the Sound of, or a Threat to, Democracy?] – [[Michigan Telecommunications and Technology Law Review]], Forthcoming 2009. "Regulating Robocalls: Are Automated Calls the Sound of, or a Threat to, Democracy?"&lt;/ref&gt;

====California====
[[California]] prohibits any robocall unless there is an existing relationship.&lt;ref name="Cal PUC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?division=1.&amp;chapter=10.&amp;part=2.&amp;lawCode=PUC&amp;article=1.|title=Codes Display Text|author=|date=|website=leginfo.legislature.ca.gov|accessdate=August 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The California Public Utilities Code §§ 2871 ''et seq.'' holds political campaigns to the same rules as other organizations making calls with an automatic dialing–announcing device.&lt;ref name="Cal PUC"/&gt; The guidelines are:
* A person must come on the line before the recording to identify the nature of the call and the organization behind it.
* The recipient of the call must consent to the recording being played.
* The call must be disconnected from the telephone line as soon as the message is over or the recipient hangs up, whichever comes first.

====Indiana====
Indiana requires introduction of any prerecorded message by a live operator; the message may only be played if the called party grants permission.&lt;ref name="states"/&gt;

====Missouri====
In September 2008, then-[[Missouri Attorney General]] [[Jay Nixon]] alerted political campaigns in Missouri that his office would aggressively enforce federal rules (Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991) requiring calls to include identifying and contact information.&lt;ref&gt;Attorney General's News Release.

September 4, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

====North Carolina====
Robocalls were made during the [[North Carolina Democratic primary, 2008|2008 North Carolina Democratic primary]], targeting [[African-American]] voters in the days leading up to the primary in late April 2008,&lt;ref&gt;[http://projects.newsobserver.com/under_the_dome/elections_board_hunting_robocaller "Elections board hunting robocaller] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080620103015/http://projects.newsobserver.com/under_the_dome/elections_board_hunting_robocaller |date=June 20, 2008 }}," ''The [[News &amp; Observer]]'', April 28, 2008.

Cooper|Roy Cooper]] ordered them to stop making the calls.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost1"/&gt; The group stopped the calls and no further legal action was taken.

====South Carolina====
{{Main|Cahaly v. LaRosa}}

[[South Carolina]] had a law prohibiting most types of unsolicited consumer and political robocalls, but in 2010, campaign consultant Robert Cahaly was arrested by the South Carolina State Law Enforcement Division, being charged for making illegal robocalls to six state house districts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wistv.com/story/13429729/gop-consultant-to-face-sled-arrest-for-illegal-robocalls|title= GOP consultant arrested for illegal "robocalls"|accessdate=Oct 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The automated opinion polling system asked whether [[Nancy Pelosi|U.S. Speaker Nancy Pelosi]] should be invited to campaign with six Democratic candidates for the South Carolina Legislature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law360.com/articles/699756/call-me-unconstitutional-hang-up-for-sc-s-robocall-law|title= Call Me Unconstitutional: Hang-Up For SC's Robocall Law|accessdate=Oct 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cahaly was arrested despite having a written opinion from the state attorney general stating that he had acted within the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fitsnews.com/2015/08/18/fourth-circuit-sc-robocall-ban-is-unconstitutional/|title= Fourth Circuit: SC Robocall Ban Is Unconstitutional|accessdate=Oct 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The charges were subsequently dismissed in October 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.postandcourier.com/article/20121006/PC16/121009479/1031/charges-of-illegal-robo-calls-against-gop-consultant-dismissed|title= Charges Against GOP Consultant Cahaly Dropped|accessdate=Oct 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the charges were dropped, Cahaly filed a suit against state officials, claiming his constitutional right to free speech had been violated. U.S. district court judge, [[J. Michelle Childs|Michelle Childs]] ruled that South Carolina's anti-robocall statute was a content-based restriction on speech and therefore unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestate.com/news/politics-government/politics-columns-blogs/the-buzz/article13862843.html|title= Fed Court rules law Cahaly charged under unconstitutional|accessdate=Oct 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Proposed additional regulations====
California Senator [[Dianne Feinstein]] (D-CA) introduced the Federal Robocall Privacy Act&lt;ref name=hearing&gt;
{{cite web |title=Protecting Voters at Home and at the Polls: Limiting Abusive Robocalls and Vote Caging Practices |url=https://www.rules.senate.gov/hearings/protecting-voters-at-home-and-at-the-polls-limiting-abusive-robocalls-and-vote-caging-practices |website=Rules of the Senate |accessdate=22 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in February 2008 at a Senate Committee on Rules and Administration hearing. The Act proposed to: 1) limit robocalls to no more than two a day by any one candidate, 2) mandate that candidates have accurate caller ID numbers displayed, 3) mandate that the disclosure of who is paying for the call occur at the start of the call, rather than at the end of the call, and 4) mandate that the time of the call occur not before 8{{nbsp}}a.m. or after 9{{nbsp}}p.m. The bill was read twice, and since it received no further action during the session, it did not become law.&lt;ref name="govtrack.us"&gt;[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=s110-2624 S. 2624: Robocall Privacy Act of 2008].

Shaun Dakin, CEO of [[Citizens for Civil Discourse]], testified at the hearing and described how robocalls affect the lives of voters across the nation.&lt;ref name=hearing/&gt; He also wrote an op-ed for the ''Washington Post'' calling for a Voter Privacy Bill of Rights in which all voters would have the right to opt out of political robocalls if they did not wish to receive them.&lt;ref&gt;Washington Post.

As mentioned above, the Robocall Privacy Act failed to become law and neither bill had provisions for a do-not-call registry for stopping robocalls.&lt;ref name="govtrack.us"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h110-5747 H.R. 5747: Robocall Privacy Act of 2008]. Accessed October 23, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite heavy media publicity of the database, only seven politicians in the United States voluntarily pledged to respect the list during the 2008 general election cycle. Of those seven, only three made it to the general election and only [[Virginia Foxx]] (R) was successfully reelected in November 2008.

On September 1, 2009, a new regulation of the [[Federal Trade Commission]] went into effect, banning most robocalls without written opt-in from the receiver.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2009/08/robocalls.shtm "New Rule Prohibiting Unwanted "Robocalls" to Take Effect on September 1", FTC News Release August 27, 2009] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003154923/http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2009/08/robocalls.shtm |date=October 3, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Political campaigns, surveys, charities, debt collectors, and health care providers are exempt, as are calls to businesses. Calls from banks, insurers, and phone companies are out of the jurisdiction of the FTC. In situations under federal jurisdiction, the federal law will supersede a slightly less restrictive law in the state of California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/pender/detail?&amp;entry_id=46359 |work=The San Francisco Chronicle |title=Kathleen Pender - Net Worth Plus : FTC is putting an end to most robo calls |date=August 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reverse robocalling==
In December 2011 reporting described "robocall revenge" where voters can turn the table and send robocalls to politicians and others using online website tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Ambreen | last = Ali | title = Website Seeks Robocall Revenge | date = December 8, 2011 | url = http://www.rollcall.com/news/website_seeks_robocall_revenge-210937-1.html?pos=opolh | work = [[Roll Call]] | accessdate =December 28, 2011 | quote = Launched last month, Reverse Robocall has already helped individuals and advocacy groups make nearly 2,000 calls to lawmakers, politicians and private companies.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Suppressing unwanted and illegal robocalls==
Many robocalls are not wanted, and several methods have been developed to prevent unwanted robocalls. Many countries operate [[do not call list]]s, but the lists have been ineffective&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=No hiding from nuisance calls|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/10108666/No-hiding-from-nuisance-calls.html|accessdate=12 December 2016|publisher=The Telegraph|date=10 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://consumersunion.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Dialing-Back-Complete-Report-11.16.2015.pdf |title=Dialing Back: How Phone Companies Can End Unwanted Robocalls |last=Mahoney |first=Maureen |year=2015 |website=Consumers Union |publisher=Consumers Union |page=3 |format=PDF |publication-date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and legally problematic in some cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Strauss|first1=Jared|title=The Do-Not-Call List's Big Hang-up|journal=Richmond Journal of Law &amp; Technology|date=2004|volume=X|issue=4|url=http://jolt.richmond.edu/v10i4/article27.pdf|accessdate=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, a market has developed for products that allow consumers to block robocalls. Most products use methods similar to those used to mitigate [[VoIP spam|SPIT]] (spam over Internet telephony) and can be broadly categorised by the primary method used. However, due to the complexity of the problem, no single method is sufficiently reliable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ziming_Zhao/publication/299794558_SoK_Everyone_Hates_Robocalls_A_Survey_of_Techniques_against_Telephone_Spam/links/5705504308ae13eb88b959e5.pdf |title=SoK: Everyone Hates Robocalls: A Survey of Techniques Against Telephone Spam |last=Huahong |first=Tu |last2=Doupé |first2=Adam |year=2016 |publisher=University of Arizona |page=14 |format=pdf |last3=Zhao |first3=Ziming |last4=Ahn |first4=Gail-Joon |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Solutions are available as both hardware and software products. [[Mobile app]]s are especially prevalent as they use techniques which do not require the modification of infrastructure. Many products are limited to use only on a single medium, such as traditional copper landlines, or [[mobile phone]] contracts from a specific [[mobile phone operator]].

=== Blacklisting and whitelisting ===
In its simplest form, this method offers the ability to prevent further calls from phone numbers, once they are known to be a source of robocalls. Many mobile apps can prevent robocalls with a user generated [[Blacklist (computing)|blacklist]].

[[File:Call-blocker-wikipedia.jpg|thumb|Landline call blocker in use]]

For landlines there are standalone call blockers which connect to the telephone. Various models work on blacklisting and whitelisting principles. Call blockers received attention from publications including [[Which?]] and [[Consumer Reports]] in the United Kingdom and United States respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Leedham |first1=Robert |title=Call blocking devices – everything you need to know |url=http://blogs.which.co.uk/technology/phones-3/call-blocking-devices-eveything-you-need-to-know/ |website=which.co.uk |publisher=Which? |accessdate=22 September 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160701075905/http://blogs.which.co.uk/technology/phones-3/call-blocking-devices-eveything-you-need-to-know/ |archivedate=2016-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rage against robocalls|url=http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine/2015/07/robocall-blocker-review/index.htm|website=consumerreports.org|publisher=Consumer Reports|accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK [[BT Group|BT]] operates a service for landlines called Choose to Refuse which allows customers to block up to 10 phone numbers of their choice for a monthly fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=All about Choose to Refuse|url=http://bt.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/8500/~/all-about-choose-to-refuse|website=BT.com Help|accessdate=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of physical products have been developed for use with landlines. These are typically installed in homes and employ a [[Hard coding|hard coded]] or irregularly updated blacklist. Some models also have the function to create a user-generated whitelist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine/2015/07/robocall-blocker-review/index.htm|title=Robocall blocker review|last=|first=|date=14 August 2015|website=Consumer Reports|publisher=|language=en|publication-date=|access-date=21 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newer devices for landlines can use cloud based data to resolve the hard coded blacklist issues and allow you to create your own whitelist/blacklist.

=== Crowdsourcing ===
A more sophisticated model uses [[crowdsourcing]] to build a more comprehensive blacklist of robocall numbers. A notable example of this is the app [[Truecaller]], which requires users to provide access to their personal [[whitelist]] of genuine contacts in exchange for access to the larger crowdsourced database. In 2013, hackers gained access to Truecaller's database of known genuine numbers, highlighting the danger of centralising this information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Truecaller Statement|url=https://blog.truecaller.com/2013/07/18/truecaller-statement/|website=Truecaller Blog|accessdate=21 November 2016|language=en|date=5 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ehackingnews.com/2013/07/truecaller-database-hacked-by-syrian.html|title=Truecaller Database hacked by Syrian Electronic Army|last=|first=|date=16 July 2013|work=|access-date=|via=E Hacking News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the [[Federal Trade Commission]] launched a competition at [[DEF CON]], with a $50,000 prize for the winner, to help develop the best concept for tackling robocalls. The winner, NoMoRoBo, was picked from 798 entries and makes use of the simultaneous ringing function to reroute potential robocalls, based on data from other users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Devpost|title=Submission Gallery - FTC Robocall Challenge|url=https://robocall.devpost.com/submissions|accessdate=21 November 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release |title=FTC Announces Robocall Challenge Winners |date=2 April 2013 |publisher=Federal Trade Commission |url=https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2013/04/ftc-announces-robocall-challenge-winners}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== CAPTCHA ===
Building on the crowdsourcing model, [[Primus Canada]] launched a patented product called Telemarketing Guard for [[landlines]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stein|first1=Matthew|title=Stopping Fraudulent Robocall Scams: Can More Be Done?|url=https://www.commerce.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/ef5915d3-e47e-4834-9a42-a4393ea03d9c/AB13B79566335ED657BFD89A085CCCA1.stein2.pdf|website=United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation|accessdate=21 November 2016|page=1|language=en|format=pdf|date=10 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It improves on previous models by including a [[CAPTCHA]] style challenge-response test.

Based on a database developed from customer feedback, it filters suspected telemarketing calls to a system which challenges callers to record their name after pressing a button. If a name is recorded, the customer's phone rings with the [[Caller ID]] of Telemarketing Guard. If they answer the phone, they are played the recording, at which point they can accept the call or decline and report it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Call-Blocking Technology|url=https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/public_events/robocalls-all-rage-ftc-summit/robocalls-part7-call-blocking.pdf|website=Federal Trade Commission|accessdate=21 November 2016|page=19|language=en|format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Realtime analysis ===
A major problem for the use of both blacklisting and whitelisting techniques is the practice of [[caller ID spoofing]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scam Alert - How Scammers Use Caller ID Spoofing to Pose as You|url=http://www.bbb.org/council/news-events/bbb-scam-alerts/2014/06/scam-alert-how-scammers-use-caller-id-spoofing-to-pose-as-you/|website=Council of Better Business Bureaus|accessdate=21 November 2016|language=en|date=20 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is prevalent as a result of the low [[Barriers to entry|barrier to entry]] in the [[VoIP]] services market.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Huahong|Doupé|Zhao|Ahn|2016|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 the [[Federal Communications Commission]] proposed a framework for the telecommunications industry in the United States, which included a validation system at network level for robocalls from [[Session Initiation Protocol|SIP]] sources by 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CGB Announces Agenda for Robocall and Caller ID Spoofing Workshop on September 16, 2015|url=https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DA-15-1001A1_Rcd.pdf|website=Federal Communications Commission|accessdate=21 November 2016|pages=9880–9881|language=en|format=pdf|date=10 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final authentication task in the framework is the signing of all VoIP calls, which would allow carriers to reliably identify robocalls.

Until these goals are achieved, a more advanced method for blocking robocalls uses [[real-time business intelligence]] techniques to address the constantly changing identities of robocalls. With access to a large enough data sample, it is possible to create algorithms which detect call patterns without requiring reporting by users.

In 2016, both [[Verizon Wireless|Verizon]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Verizon Caller Name ID|url=https://www.verizonwireless.com/solutions-and-services/caller-name-id/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sprint Corporation|Sprint]] each launched their own service based on Enhanced Caller ID, which is developed by Cequint and incorporates whitelisting, blacklisting and crowdsourcing techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release |title=TNS and Cequint Deploy Next Generation Robocall Solution Delivering Best-in-Class Service for Sprint Customers |date=30 November 2016 |publisher=Business Wire |location=Reston, Virginia |url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20161130005642/en/}}&lt;/ref&gt; For improved accuracy, it is complemented by a technology called Call Guardian developed by [[Transaction Network Services|TNS]], which performs caller behavior analysis on the 25 billion public calls they handle every year in real time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TNS Call Guardian|url=http://www.tnsi.com/products-services/telecom/protecting/tns-call-guardian/|website=TNS|accessdate=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Enforcement==

In August 2016, a "Robocall Strike Force" of thirty companies said they would help crack down on the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-robocalls/att-apple-google-to-work-on-robocall-crackdown-idUSKCN10U18L|title=AT&amp;T, Apple, Google to work on 'robocall' crackdown|date=August 20, 2016|publisher=|via=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2015 Federal Communications Commission Declaratory Rulings===

After receiving more than 215,000 consumer complaints in 2014 alone, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) strengthened and clarified its regulations protecting consumers from unwanted robocalls and spam emails and texts. The Commission issued a package of declaratory rulings in June 2015 that clarified the provisions of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) that deal with prerecorded and artificial voice calls received by residential wireline phones as well as wireless numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://incompliancemag.com/commission-strengthens-consumer-protections-against-robocalls/|title=Commission Strengthens Consumer Protections Against Robocalls|work=In Compliance Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2009 Federal Trade Commission action against an illegal robocall provider===
In May 2009, in response to numerous complaints, the [[Federal Trade Commission]] asked a federal court to shut down a telemarketing campaign that has been bombarding U.S. consumers with hundreds of millions of allegedly deceptive robocalls in an effort to sell them vehicle service contracts under the guise that they are extensions of original vehicle [[Warranty|warranties]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2009/09/twi.shtm, "FTC Settlement Bans Robocalls from Auto "Warranty" Company", FTC News Release, 9/1/2009&lt;/ref&gt; The FTC took action against both the promoter of the phony extended auto warranties, as well as the telemarketing company that it hired to carry out its illegal, deceptive campaign. The FTC contends that the companies are operating a massive telemarketing scheme that uses random, pre-recorded phone calls to deceive consumers into thinking that their vehicle's warranty is about to expire. Consumers who respond to the robocalls are pressured to purchase extended service contracts for their vehicles, which the telemarketers falsely portray as an extension of the manufacturer's original warranty. According to papers the FTC filed with the court, however, the robocalls have prompted tens of thousands of complaints from consumers who are either on the United States National Do Not Call Registry or asked not to be called. Five telephone numbers associated with the defendants have generated a total of 30,000 Do Not Call complaints. Consumers received the robocalls at home, work, and on their cell phones, sometimes several times in one day. Businesses, government offices and even 911 dispatchers have been subjected to the calls.

Those who answer the pre-recorded calls hear a message telling them that their vehicle warranty is about to expire and that they should "extend coverage before it is too late." They are told to "press one" to speak to a "warranty specialist." The "specialists" then mislead consumers into believing that their company is affiliated with the dealer or manufacturer of the consumer's vehicle. They try to sell consumers a service contract for between $2,000 and $3,000, which they falsely portray as an extension of the vehicle's original warranty. The seller of extended auto warranties sued by the FTC allegedly took in more than $10 million on the sale of these deceptively marketed service contracts. In their robocalls, the companies dialed every phone number within a particular area code and prefix sequentially, without knowing whether the consumers called were motorists or owned motor vehicles, or whether those consumers' numbers were on the Do Not Call Registry. Consumers who asked that the calls be stopped often were met with "abusive behavior" or were simply hung up on, according to the papers filed with the court. Some of the defendants used offshore shell corporations to try to avoid scrutiny, and a top officer in the telemarketing company bragged to prospective clients that he could operate outside the law without any chance of being caught by the FTC, the papers stated. This defendant also claimed that he makes 1.8 million dials per day and that he had done more than $40 million worth of dialing for extended warranty companies, including one billion dials on behalf of his largest client, according to the court papers filed by the FTC. In addition to the robocalls, the FTC charged that the company selling the warranties mails out deceptive postcards to consumers, warning them about the imminent expiration of their auto warranties. The postcards are designed to mislead consumers into believing that they are being contacted by their dealer or manufacturer, and the postcards offer consumers the chance to "renew" their original warranties.&lt;ref name="case"&gt;[https://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20090515-717706.html FTC: Judge Orders Halt To Robocalls Selling Deceptive Warranties], ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', May 15, 2009 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090714024144/http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20090515-717706.html |date=July 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 15, 2009 U.S. District Judge [[John Francis Grady|John F. Grady]] issued the temporary restraining order against the defendants Transcontinental Warranty Inc. and Voice Touch Inc. Grady's orders also applied to Transcontinental CEO and President Christopher Cowart, Voice Touch executives James and Maureen Dunne, Voice Touch business partner Network Foundations LLC and Network Foundations executive Damian Kohlfeld. Besides ordering a halt to the automatic telephone sales calls, Grady's order froze the assets of the two companies. The FTC alleged in its complaints that the calls were part of a deceptive scheme and asked the court to assure the assets will not be lost in case they might be needed to repay consumers who have been victimized. The FTC isn't immediately seeking civil fines against the companies but may do so later, agency officials said. Attorneys general in Arkansas, Indiana and Missouri have taken similar actions over calls offering extended warranties on automobiles.&lt;ref name="case1"&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jFpGIsUi1KVrRr07BBoVqLrkz0ZQD986V9404 Judge blocks 'robo-calls' selling car warranties], [[Associated Press]], May 15, 2009 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090607220858/https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jFpGIsUi1KVrRr07BBoVqLrkz0ZQD986V9404 |date=June 7, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6551">{{Canadian Charter}}
'''Section 18''' of the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]'' is one of the provisions of the Constitution that addresses rights relating to [[Canada]]'s two [[official language]]s, [[English (language)|English]] and [[French (language)|French]].  Like section 133 of the ''[[Constitution Act, 1867]]'', section 18 requires that all [[statute]]s and other records made by the [[Parliament of Canada]] must be available in both official languages.  Section 133 places a similar obligation on the legislature of [[Quebec]], and this is reaffirmed by [[Section Twenty-one of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 21]] of the ''Charter''.  Section 18 of the ''Charter'' places a similar obligation on the [[legislative Assembly of New Brunswick|legislature]] of [[New Brunswick]].  New Brunswick is the only officially bilingual province under [[Section Sixteen of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 16]] of the ''Charter''.

==Text==
Section 18 reads,

{{cquote|18.(1)  The statutes, records and journals of Parliament shall be printed and published in English and French and both language versions are equally authoritative.

(2)  The statutes, records and journals of the legislature of New Brunswick shall be printed and published in English and French and both language versions are equally authoritative.}}

==Application==
Justice [[Michel Bastarache]] and fellow-authors wrote of section 18 that it repeats section 133 in necessitating Parliament's statutes being kept in both official languages, and that section 18 "adds that both versions are equally authoritative."  They compared this clause to sections 56 and 57 of the ''[[Constitution Act, 1982]]'', which state that English and French versions of the Constitution are equal.&lt;ref name="Bastarache"&gt;Bastarache, Michel, Andre Braen, Emmanuel Didier and Pierre Foucher, ''Language Rights in Canada'', ed. Michel Bastarache, trans. Translation Devinat et Associés, Ottawa, (Montréal, Quebec:  Editions Yvon Blais, 1987), p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;  Earlier, however, court decisions suggested the equal status of English and French versions was implicit in section 133.&lt;ref&gt;Bastarache, Braen, Didier and Foucher, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;  Bastarache and his fellow-authors also argued that section 18 implies bilingualism is to be used in the making of the law, and state that failure to satisfy section 18 means any laws are unconstitutional.&lt;ref name="Bastarache"/&gt;

==Challenges==
Section 18 causes a number of challenges in law making.  Someone [[Translation|translating]] a law from one official language to another will have to ensure that the two versions do not contradict one another.&lt;ref name="Bastarache2"&gt;Bastarache, Braen, Didier and Foucher, pp. 110-111.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hence, the federal government has tried to ensure laws are written in both English and French to begin with, as opposed to the usual method in which laws written in English would then be translated to French.&lt;ref name="Bastarache2"/&gt;

If the two versions of a law contradict each other anyway, the equality under section 18 causes [[Court system of Canada|courts]] to interpret them by means of "cross-interpretation," which means the courts interpret both while referencing the other.  An interpretation that most plausibly could apply to both of the two contradictory versions will be adopted.  Additionally, the purpose of the law may be considered, so that the version most geared toward the purpose will be applied.  In some cases, one version of a law that is more explicit than the other will receive priority.&lt;ref name="Bastarache2"/&gt;

==Interpretation==
In the 1986 [[Supreme Court of Canada|Supreme Court]] case ''[[Société des Acadiens v. Association of Parents]]'', Justice [[Jean Beetz]] commented on section 18.  He called it one of the few language rights in the ''Charter'', along with [[Section Twenty of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 20]], that is meant to promote discussion that everyone is able to understand.  Section 20 addresses public services, while Beetz noted section 18 "provides for bilingualism at the legislative level."&lt;ref name="Beetz"&gt;Beetz J., ''Société des Acadiens v. Association of Parents'', [1986] 1 S.C.R. 549.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[New Brunswick Court of Appeal]] considered subsection 18(2), which requires bilingual statutes and records to be kept by the provincial legislature, for the first time in the 2001 case ''Charlebois v. Mowat''.  The court extended subsection 18(2)'s requirement to municipal laws, with reference to sections 16 and [[Section Sixteen One of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 16.1]] of the ''Charter''.  Although the Supreme Court had said in ''[[Quebec (Attorney General) v. Blaikie (No. 2)]]'' (1981) that the section 133 requirements of the Quebec legislature do not extend to Quebec municipalities, the New Brunswick court observed section 133 and the ''Charter'' are separate laws enacted for different purposes.  According to ''[[R. v. Beaulac]]'' (1999), the ''Charter'' rights should be interpreted more liberally.  The ''Charter'' rights should support [[minority language]] groups.  Legislation was defined as laws applying to people, and municipal laws fit this description.  Finally, it was noted that municipalities exist under the authority of the provincial governments, which are bound by the ''Charter'' under [[Section Thirty-two of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 32]].&lt;ref&gt;''Charlebois v. Mowat'', 2001 NBCA 117 (CanLII).&lt;/ref&gt;   (A related case later went to the [[Supreme Court of Canada|Supreme Court]] as ''[[Charlebois v. Saint John (City)]]''.)

== Early life ==
Rahim was born in 1859 in Muhammadpur, [[Basirhat]], [[24 Parganas|24-Parganas]], [[Bengal Presidency]], [[British Raj]]. His mother died at a young age and he was subsequently raised by Radhamadhav Basu. Basu was the Zamindar of Taki and a Deputy Magistrate. Rahim studied at a school in Taki and went to High School in Kolkata.

The [[Social identity theory|social identity]] model of deindividuation effects (or SIDE model) is a theory developed in [[social psychology]] and communication studies. SIDE explains the effects of [[anonymity]] and identifiability on group behavior. It has become one of several theories examining technology that describe social effects of [[Computer-mediated communication|computer-mediated]] communication. With advancing technology it is becoming increasingly researched what the effects of having the control of being incognito on the web, and also having profiles that represent ones person is doing to relationships and communication in our lives. The SIDE model provides an alternative explanation for effects of [[anonymity]] and other "deindividuating" factors that classic deindividuation theory cannot adequately explain. To understand the model of deindividuation, it is described by scholarly articles as "the situation in which individuals act in groups and do not see themselves as individuals, thereby facilitating antinormative behavior"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kim|first=Kyung Kyu|last2=Lee|first2=Ae Ri|last3=Lee|first3=Un-Kon|date=July 2018|title=Impact of anonymity on roles of personal and group identities in online communities|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0378720618302490|journal=Information &amp; Management|doi=10.1016/j.im.2018.07.005|issn=0378-7206}}&lt;/ref&gt; .

== Background ==

SIDE developed as a critique of deindividuation theory. Deindividuation theory was developed to explain the phenomenon that in crowds, people become capable of acts that rational individuals would not normally endorse (see also [[Crowd psychology]]). In the crowd, so it would seem, humans become disinhibited and behave anti-normatively. Early versions of deindividuation theory&lt;ref name="Zimbardo" /&gt; saw this as a consequence of reduced self-awareness and accountability. Diener&lt;ref name="Diener" /&gt; and others later focused more exclusively on loss of self as the core psychological process underlying deindividuation.

Reicher&lt;ref name="Reicher1982"&gt;Reicher, S.D. (1982)  The determination of collective behaviour.  In Tajfel (Ed.) Social Identity and Intergroup Relations  Cambridge, CUP, and Paris, Maison des Sciences de l'Homme.&lt;/ref&gt; criticized deindividuation theory for several reasons. Among others, historical evidence and case studies strongly suggested that the psychological process proposed by deindividuation theory (a loss of self) did not occur in the crowd.&lt;ref&gt;McPhail, C. (1991). ''The myth of the madding crowd.'' New York: de Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[meta-analysis]] of empirical deindividuation research confirmed there was no consistent empirical evidence for the processes it proposed.&lt;ref&gt;Postmes, T., &amp; Spears, R. (1998). Deindividuation and anti-normative behavior: A meta-analysis. ''Psychological Bulletin, 123'', 238–259.&lt;/ref&gt; To the contrary: anonymity and reduced self-awareness enhanced sensitivity to local norms. SIDE researchers concluded that there is no good empirical support for the process of deindividuation, and factors that should produce deindividuation have highly variable effects on behavior.&lt;ref name="SIMoDP"&gt;Reicher, S., Spears, R., &amp; Postmes, T. (1995). A social identity model of deindividuation phenomena. European Review of Social Psychology, 6, 161–198.&lt;/ref&gt; To account for this, SIDE proposes that there are no blanket indiscriminate effects of anonymity, but that anonymity effects are influenced by, and can only be understood through, their interaction with the social context.

Reicher&lt;ref name="Reicher1982" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reicher, S. (1987). Crowd behaviour as social action. In J. C. Turner, M. A. Hogg, P. J. Oakes, S. Reicher &amp; M. S. Wetherell (Eds.), ''Rediscovering the social group: A self-categorization theory'' (pp.&amp;nbsp;171–202). Oxford, England: Basil Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; also challenged the conceptualization of deindividuation as a loss of self. This process assumes that individuals have a unitary self-concept that they can be more or less aware of.  Reicher and others argued that individuals do not have a unitary sense of self. [[Social identity theory]], for instance, points out that one's sense of self is made up of personal identity and multiple social identities, all of which combine to shape one's personality.  Social identities are likely to become the basis for self-definition when that social identity is salient, such as when making comparisons between "them" and "us".  One consequence of salience is "depersonalization". Note that in research on social identity, depersonalization is not the same as deindividuation or a loss of self (cf. the entry on [[Depersonalization]] to read up on what it is not).  In social identity research, the term depersonalization refers to a switch to a group level of self-categorization in which self and others are seen in terms of their group identities.

According to [[self-categorization theory]],&lt;ref&gt;Turner, J. C., Hogg, M. A., Oakes, P. J., Reicher, S., &amp; Wetherell, M. S. (1987). ''Rediscovering the social group: A self-categorization theory.'' Oxford, England: Basil Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; depersonalization makes perceptions of the outgroup more stereotypical.  Self-perceptions also shift: self and other ingroup members become interchangeable, and the individual self-stereotypes in terms of group attributes. Depersonalization thus transforms individuals into group members who regulate their behavior according to in-group norms. Importantly, and in contrast to deindividuation, the psychological state of depersonalization does not imply a loss of rationality or behavioural disinhibition; rather, the individual behaves rationally and regulates behaviour according to ingroup standards.  These ideas from social identity theory and self-categorization theory provided not only key ingredients for Reicher's critique of deindividuation theory, they are also the foundations upon which SIDE was modelled.

== Development ==

The model was first named by Lea and Spears&lt;ref name="LeaSpears1991"&gt;Lea, M., &amp; Spears, R. (1991). Computer-mediated communication, de-individuation and group decision-making. ''International Journal of Man Machine Studies, 34'', 283–301.&lt;/ref&gt; and later developed in a series of publications.&lt;ref&gt;Lea, M., &amp; Spears R. (1992). Paralanguage and social perception in computer-mediated communication. ''Journal of Organizational Computing'', ''2'', 321–341.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PostmesSpearsLea1998"&gt;Postmes, T., Spears, R., &amp; Lea, M. (1998). Breaching or building social boundaries? SIDE-effects of computer-mediated communication. ''Communication Research'', ''25'', 689–715.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SpearsLea1994"&gt;Spears, R., &amp; Lea, M. (1994). Panacea or panopticon? The hidden power in computer-mediated communication. ''Communication Research'', ''21,'' 427–459.&lt;/ref&gt; The SIDE model took Reicher's ideas about the crowd, and applied and extended them to [[computer-mediated communication]]. Early research in this domain suggested that, similar to deindividuation theory, users of online computer were prone to flaming and other disinhibitions due to a reduction in social cues.&lt;ref&gt;Kiesler, S., Siegel, J., &amp; McGuire, T. W. (1984). Social psychological aspects of computer-mediated communication. ''American Psychologist, 39,'' 1123–1134.&lt;/ref&gt; The SIDE model was developed, in first instance, to account for contradictory effects of social cues in online groups. SIDE thus assumed that effects in the crowd and in online environments showed some similar properties.

The first comprehensive statement of SIDE was by Reicher, Spears, &amp; Postmes.&lt;ref name="SIMoDP" /&gt; According to SIDE, a [[social identity approach]] can account for many of the effects observed in [[deindividuation]] research and in [[crowd psychology]], as well as in [[computer-mediated communication]].  For example, deindividuation has been found to foster group identification and to induce greater opinion polarization in small groups communicating online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lee|first=Eun-Ju|title=Deindividuation Effects on Group Polarization in Computer-Mediated Communication: The Role of Group Identification, Public-Self-Awareness, and Perceived Argument Quality|journal=Journal of Communication|year=2007|volume=57|issue=2|page=385|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.2007.00348.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In order to understand effects of factors such as anonymity and reduced cues on group behavior, one needs to take the social and inter-group context into account.  SIDE argues that anonymity and social context in interaction have cognitive and strategic consequences.

== Cognitive SIDE ==

Group immersion and anonymity have cognitive consequences that affect the relative salience of personal and social identities.  These factors do not produce a loss of self as proposed by [[deindividuation]] theory.  Rather, anonymity and immersion in the group can enhance the [[salience (neuroscience)|salience]] of social identity and thereby depersonalize social perceptions of others and the self.  SIDE argues this occurs principally because (visual) anonymity obscures individual features and interpersonal differences.  As a result of the decreased visibility of the individual within anonymous groups, the process of depersonalization is accentuated, and cognitive efforts to perceive the group as an entity are amplified.  Provided that there is some basis to perceive self and others as members of one group, anonymity therefore enhances the salience of the shared [[social identity]].  The net result is that people will tend to perceive self and others in terms of stereotypic group features, and are influenced accordingly.&lt;ref name="PostmesSpearsLea1998" /&gt;

It is important to note that anonymity does not automatically or mechanically influence the salience of social identities.  An individual can be identified in such a way that it promotes a more individuated person-perception or alternatively that it promotes a stronger social categorization. In a few instances, making the individual more identifiable may strengthen social categorization. This may happen particularly in contexts within which these social categories are potentially meaningful and therefore accessible, and when group memberships are visually clearly identifiable (as is the case for gender, certain racial characteristics, disabilities, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Spears, R., Postmes, T., Lea, M., &amp; Wolbert, A. (2002). The power of influence and the influence of power in virtual groups: A SIDE look at CMC and the Internet. ''The Journal of Social Issues, 58,'' 91–108.&lt;/ref&gt;).

SIDE thus describes the cognitive process by which the salience of social identity is affected by the absence or presence of individuating information.  It is important to note that this process can only operate to the extent that some sense of groupness exists from the outset.  If individuals interact anonymously in the absence of any specific social identity or group boundaries, anonymity would have the reverse effect of accentuating one’s isolation from the group or by further obscuring group boundaries.&lt;ref name="LeaSpears1991" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Postmes, T., Spears, R., Sakhel, K., &amp; De Groot, D. (2001). Social influence in computer-mediated communication: The effects of anonymity on group behavior. ''Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin'', ''27,'' 1242–1254.&lt;/ref&gt;  Juxtaposing the two possibilities, anonymity in the group either has the effect of amplifying a shared social identity that, however rudimentary, is already in place, or it can amplify the individual independence which exists in contexts in which no shared identity is available.  The latter process, whereby anonymity provides the opportunities for people to express and develop identities independent of the social influence of the group, is further elaborated in the Strategic SIDE.

== Strategic SIDE ==

Anonymity also has strategic consequences: it affects the ability to express personal and social identities.&lt;ref name="SpearsLea1994" /&gt; Strategic concerns come into play when an out-group has more power than the ingroup, and where the norms of both groups are at odds with each other.  In such cases, the identifiability of ingroup members towards the outgroup will shift the power balance between groups: identifiability towards a more powerful outgroup limits the degree to which the ingroup's identity can be expressed freely and without sanction on those dimensions where ingroup norms conflict with out-group standards and values, and which are punishable or otherwise sanctionable. Conversely, anonymity towards a more powerful outgroup may be a convenient instrument for the ingroup to express itself on those same dimensions.

The strategic SIDE thus proposes that anonymity may be "used" by less powerful groups to express aspects of their identity. This may appear to be similar to the effects that anonymity has for [[accountability]] in classic [[deindividuation]] theory. However, unlike deindividuation theory, SIDE takes account of the inter-group context within which identifiability and anonymity occur.  By implication, a loss of accountability does not result in the disinhibited or random anti-normative behaviour of individuals that deindividuation theory is concerned with.  Rather, according to SIDE, anonymity affects the ability for a group to express its identity, and thus to engage in targeted and ingroup normative behaviour, thereby changing power relations between groups.  The close connection between identity expression and power proposed by SIDE may explain the patterned and targeted behaviour of crowds whose violent actions (if they occur) are very often symbolic, not random.&lt;ref name="SIMoDP" /&gt;

In addition to anonymity between groups, SIDE also considers strategic effects of anonymity within groups. Here, SIDE has particularly explored the consequences of anonymity (as well as isolation) from other ingroup members: On the one hand this deprives individual group members of social support from their fellows, and this may hinder their ability to express their ingroup identity in the face of a powerful and unsympathetic outgroup. On the other hand, the knowledge that other ingroup members are unable to identify the self may have consequences for (in particular) low identifiers to feel less committed to ingroup norms.

==Applications==

'''Supyire''', or '''Suppire''', is a [[Senufo language]] spoken in the [[Sikasso Region]] of southeastern Mali and in adjoining regions of Ivory Coast, where it is known as ''Shempire (Syenpire)''. In their native language, the noun ''sùpyìré'' means both "the people" and "the language spoken by the people".

==Background==
The early existence of Supyire is unclear. During the time period in which the language developed, it has been hypothesized that there was little conflict in the region which resulted in a significant amount of separation between the ancestors of the Supyire and other cultures of the area. If individuals speaking a single language migrated to the region of present-day [[Mali]] and then broke off into small groups that had little connection, it would be expected that the languages would develop different characteristics over time. Recently, close contact with other tribes has resulted in a dictionary full of loan words that have been assimilated into everyday language. Education has affected cultural language in this area. Although few are literate, many children attend primary school where a mixture of languages can be presented. There is ongoing controversy over the use of “mother tongues” in schools. Current law states that primary schools educate in the mother tongue whereas secondary schools emphasize the use of a common language.

The language group of [[Senufo language|Senufo]] can be divided into northern, central, and southern branches, with Supyire being classified as the southernmost northern Senufo language. The Senufo language group, with approximately 2. 2 million speakers, extends from the southwest corner of [[Mali]] and covers a significant portion of the northern [[Ivory Coast]]. There are also isolated pockets of this language group in [[Burkina Faso]] and [[Ghana]].  As a group, the [[Senufo people|Senufo]] people are considered to be one of the oldest ethnic groups of the [[Ivory Coast]], having settled there in the early 17th century. It is hypothesized that the Senufo descended from the [[Kenedugu]] people, who ruled over [[Mali]] and [[Burkina Faso]] during the 17th century. It was this culture that established the village of [[Sikasso]], which now stands as the cultural center for the Supyire people. [[Sikasso]] was the last city to fall into French control during their invasion of Mali in 1888. Mali existed under French Colonial rule as the nation of [[French Sudan]]. In 1958, French Sudan claimed autonomy and was renamed the  [[Sudanese Republic]]. In 1960 the  [[Sudanese Republic]] became the independent country of Mali.

As a group of people, the Supyire survive by cultivating the landscape. Individuals make a living off of the land, primarily by cultivating [[Yam (vegetable)|yams]], [[millet]], and [[sorghum]], a tradition that has perpetuated through their ancestral history. With the integration of agricultural processes from neighboring cultures, [[bananas]] and [[manioc]] have also been successfully cultivated. Care of livestock, including [[chickens]], [[sheep]], [[goats]], and  [[guinea fowl]], provides a significant source of nutrition. In this culture, wealth is correlated to the number and quality of livestock as opposed to money. Both hunting and fishing are also important, although to a much smaller degree. Although the Supyire have risen above the level of [[hunter-gatherer]], their traditional mode of organization has not risen above the village level. In Supyire culture it is rare that any single person holds excessive power and there are only two traditional classes- the laborers and the farmers.

As a culture, the Supyire, and most Senufo groups, are most known for their artwork. [[Artisan]]s in these communities are regarded to the highest degree. Most artwork consists of sculptures used to bring deities to life. Animal figures such as [[zebra]]s, [[crocodile]]s, and [[giraffe]]s are very common. Storytelling also plays a significant role in this culture and one of the first written documents of the Supyire was a story entitled “Warthog’s Laughter Teeth”.  The Senufo practice of [[female circumcision]] has made this culture recognizable on a worldwide level. The practice of female circumcision, done for cultural or religious reasons, is meant to mark a rite of passage as girls become women. In these cultures, men are also expected to go through various rites of passage. The predominant religion of the region is Muslim, although most “bushmen” tend to instead place their faith in human-like gods. Worshipping of deceased ancestors is also common.

Supyire has a voicing distinction and contains a [[glottal stop]], a common characteristic in African languages. However, it does not have [[labial–velar consonant]]s.

Voiceless stops have particular limitations and are only used in three environments: word initial, such as tàcwɔ̀ (“fiancée”); medially in a stressed syllable, as in nupéé; or following a nasal, such as in kàntugo (“behind”). Moreover, almost every word-initial {{IPA|/ɡ/}} is found in [[loanword]]s from either French or Bambara.

Although both voiceless and voiced [[fricative]]s are found, [[voiceless fricative]]s such as {{IPA|/f/}} and {{IPA|/s/}} are much more common than the [[voiced fricative]]s {{IPA|/v/}}, {{IPA|/z/}}, and {{IPA|/ʒ/}}.

There is no labial approximant.

In speech, {{IPA|/w/}} does not come after a short stressed syllable.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, 1994, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Supyire contains nasal consonants, there is considerable debate over their phonemic status. According to a well-formulated hypothesis, the predecessor of Supyire had no nasal consonants but nasalized vowels did exist. Some [[linguists]] thus categorize nasal consonants as simple variants of the approximants that occur before nasal vowels.

Supyire is reported to have the rare [[uvular flap]] as an allophone of {{IPA|/ɡ/}} in unstressed syllables.&lt;ref name="Carlson 1994, p. 10"&gt;Carlson 1994, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; This parallels {{IPA|/d/}} surfacing as {{IPA|[ɾ]}} in the same environment.&lt;ref name="Carlson 1994, p. 10"/&gt;

Supyire has 12 vowels in total, with seven [[oral vowel]]s and five [[nasal vowels]] (which are indicated by an n after the vowel). Two oral vowels, /ɛ/ and /ɔ/ are not as well-established as the other five because the difference between /ɛ/ and /a/ is neutralized and, when speaking quickly, it is very difficult to distinguish between /ɑ/, a variant of /ɔ/, and /a/. It does appear that some speakers preferentially choose one pronunciation over the other, although some do use both pronunciations and some use a variant somewhere in the middle.

[[Vowel harmony]] is also important in the Supyire language. This is done by harmonizing unstressed vowels with the initial stressed vowel if they both belong to the same root or have the same suffix.

===Syllables===
Supyire has a noticeable syllable structure that includes no [[closed syllables]]. In Supyire, syllables are most often either CV or CVV although the pronouns u and uru both begin with a vowel syllable. Supyire words also tend to have only one stressed syllable in every root. Stress is most often placed on the initial syllable of a root although many roots exist with no stress on the first syllable. Affixes and other grammatical sounds, such as those that indicate pronouns, do not have stress.

===Tone===
Supyire is [[tonal language|tonal]] (common in African languages).

The language has four basic tones: high, low, strong mid, and weak mid. While the high and low tones are unremarkable, the two mid tones are only differentiated by differences in their behavior when referencing tone rules, and not by their pitch. These unusual mid tones are found in all northern Senufo languages but not in central Senufo languages, which only have three tones. 
* high tone is indicated by an acute accent: á é ɛ́ í ó ɔ́ ú;
* mid tone is indicated by no diacritic : a e ɛ i o ɔ u;
* low tone is indicated by a grave accent : à è ɛ̀ ì ò ɔ̀ ù;
* the other mid (high-low) is indicated by a circumflex : {{graphie|â ê ɛ̂ î ô ɔ̂ û}}.

Most vowels in the Supyire language contain a single tone although vowels may have two, or in extremely rare cases three, tones. Further, nasals that come before stops can only have one tone. Basic noun gender suffixes, imperfective verb suffixes, the causative verb suffix –g followed by a vowel, and the intransitive verb prefix N- are considered toneless.

It was noted that boys who spent their days herding cows communicated with each other strictly through [[whistled language]], which only elaborated vowel length and pitch. These small pieces of information were enough to have conversations of considerable detail.

==Morphology==

===Class system===
The noun class system of Supyire is similar to that of other languages in the [[Niger–Congo]] family. This system includes eight [[noun classes]] that are grouped into five [[noun genders]]. While there is noun class agreement between pronouns and their head nouns, there is no verb agreement. However, there is agreement between quantifiers (such as determiners and independent adjectives) and the head noun.

The gender system of Supyire does differ slightly from the gender systems of other similar languages. [[Bantu languages|Bantu]], also a subgroup of Niger–Congo languages, places different forms of the same word into varying gender classes. For example, the [[Swahili language|Swahili]] word for friend is ''rafiki'' and it is a class 9 noun. However, the plural form ''marafiki'' belongs to noun class 6. This confusion over noun class distinction does not occur in any Senufo language, Supyire included.

In Supyire, gender 1 is categorized as the “human” gender. Instead of classifying loan words by their definition, those who speak Supyire tend to classify loan words by their suffixes and thus most loan words, regardless of meaning, are placed into gender 1. More than half of the dictionary of gender one nouns is loan words. Nouns found in this category range from general human terms such as ''ceewe'' (“woman”) and ''pyà'' (“child”) to terms that describe relationships such as ''nafentu'' (“wife’s father”). Also found in this category are terms that describe people such as ''̀ŋaŋa'' (“twin”) or ''cevoo'' (“friend”). Gender 1 also contains class terms and occupational terms such as ''ciiwe'' (“leather-worker”), ''tunntun'' (“blacksmith”) and ''sòròlashí'' (“soldier”). Supernatural entities are also categorized into the human gender. The word for god, ''kile'', is categorized as a gender 1 noun. This gender also contains some “higher” animals and mass nouns such as dust and sand.

Gender 2 is typically described as the category that contains nouns that are “big things” while gender 3 contains nouns of “small things”. Thus, gender 2 includes, for example, trees and tree parts such as ''cige'' (“tree”), ''logo'' (“shea tree”), and ''weŋe'' (“leaf”). Also included in gender 2 are large, immovable objects such as ''baga'' (“house, building”), ''caanga'' (“market”) and ''kacige'' (“bridge”) and most large animals. Gender 2 contains nouns that describe desires such as ''katege'' (“hunger”) and ''byaga'' (“thirst”). Gender 3 contains small animals such as ''lùpààn'' (“mosquito”). Gender 4 is known as the “collectives” category and contains mass nouns and abstract nouns. Some examples of mass nouns are ''pworo'' (“adobe”) and ''kyara'' (“meat”). Abstracts are used to convey emotional states and include words such as ''sícyere'' (“insanity”) and ''wyere'' (“cold”). The final category of noun gender 5 contains nouns for liquids. For example, this is the gender of ''sìnmε'' (“beer”) and ''jirimε'' (“milk”). 
	
In Supyire, gender is marked by [[suffixes]]. Basic gender suffixes in Supyire most often have the form –CV, seen in six of the eight classes. Suffixes in this instance are toneless. The first three gender systems include both singular and plural forms while gender 4 and 5 do not. For example, singular gender 1 nouns employ the suffix ''–wV'', singular gender 2 nouns use ''–gV'' normally, singular gender 3 nouns employ ''–lV'', gender 4 nouns use the basic suffix ''–rV'', and gender 5 uses ''–mV'' as a suffix. Plural gender 1 nouns do not adhere so strictly to the rules and can vary in consonant usage. However, all end in ''–ii'' or ''–íí''.

===Verb morphology===
Although [[Niger–Congo]] languages tend to have complicated verb morphology systems, Supyire does not follow this trend. There are only four types of [[affixes]] seen in the Supyire language- verb prefixes, imperfective aspect suffixes, the causative suffix, and the plural or intensive suffix. The language of Supyire also uses verb compounding, although the system is very basic. Supyire is both a prefixing and suffixing language. There are two verb prefixes used in Supyire- an intransitive prefix and a future prefix. The perfect and recent past do not have prefixes. The intransitive prefix is marked only by a toneless nasal. The intransitive prefix exists only with verbs that begin with voiceless stops the prefix depends on the location of the direct object in a sentence (see below, examples C and D). This is exemplified by the following:
 
a. Voiceless stop—prefix appears

Pi màha m-pa náhá.
They HAB IP-come here.
“They come here.”

b. Fricative—no prefix
Pi màha shya aní

c. Mìì ná   m̀pà ta.
I PAST sheep get
“I got a sheep.”

d. Mpà mìì ná     ń-tá.
sheep I PAST IP-get.
“It was a sheep that I got.”
  
Alternatively, the future prefix is used with verbs that apply a future time reference.  In conjunction with certain verb prefixes, the auxiliaries ''sí'' and ''cáá'' are also used. It also differs from the first prefix in that it uses a distinct tone and it appears on all verbs, not just those beginning with voiceless stops. Just as with the intransitive prefix, the future prefix uses a nasal attached to a verb that is not preceded by a direct object. As an example:

a.Mìì sí m̀-pà.
I FUT FP-come.
“I will come.”

===Adjectives===
Supyire does not include many adjectives, since most adjectives can be represented by the use of stative verbs instead. However, a small group of adjectives do exist. Adjectives are created in two ways in Supyire: either by compounding or by using derived adjectives.  The following are examples of adjectival roots and root compounding:
 
a. Root: ''-fu-'' ("hot")
      
b. kafee-fu-go  (“hot wind”)

==Syntax==

===Sentence structure===
Although almost all Niger–Congo languages have a sentence structure that follows the subject–verb–object pattern, Supyire and other Senufo languages do not follow in this way. Instead, these languages are verb-final and most often are subject–object–verb. The following examples provide evidence for this sentence structure:

a. Kà u ú ŋ́́-káré sà a ci-ré pààn-nì. “He went to chop the trees”
   DS G1S NARR IP-go go PROG tree-DEF.G4 chop-IMPV

b. Lùpà-àn         sì   ǹ-tὲὲn  ù  nà. “A mosquito sat on him”
   A mosquito-G3S NARR IP-sit G1S on

==Number system==
The number system of the Supyire people is unique, and quite confusing. Values exist for numbers 1-5, 10, 20, 80, and 400. Strangely, all of these numerals are members of gender 1 except “four hundred”, which is in gender 3. The numbers 6-9 are formed using a combination of basic math and the prefix baa–. The word for “six” is ''baa-nì'', translated to mean “five and one”, although the root of “one” has been shortened.  After ten, a distinct [[prefix]] is associated with the teens, twenties, thirties, and so on (see Table 4).   The word for 80, ''ŋ`kùù'', is formally and etymologically identical to the word for 'chicken'.  This identity is inexplicable to speakers; Carlson (1994) supposes it to relate to a historical price of a chicken.

Because of obvious confusion with this number system and close contact with neighboring [[Bambara people]], the Supyire have been slowly disregarding this system. Like other languages in this region, numerals that refer to money (in this instance, the [[franc]]) are counted in groups of five.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6614">== The Contact Zone ==
In a 1991 keynote address to the [[Modern Language Association]] titled “Arts of the Contact Zone,” [[Mary Louise Pratt]] introduced the concept of “the contact zone.” She articulated, “I use this term to refer to social spaces where cultures meet, clash and grapple with each other, often in contexts of highly asymmetrical relations of power, such as colonialism, slavery, or their aftermaths as they lived out in many parts of the world today” (34).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Arts of the Contact Zone|jstor = 25595469|journal = Profession|date = 1991-01-01|pages = 33–40|first = Mary Louise|last = Pratt}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pratt described a site for linguistic and cultural encounters, wherein power is negotiated and struggle occurs. Although when introduced this term was in the context of literacy and literary theories, the term has been appropriated to conversations across the humanities and has been used in the context of feminist theory, critical race theory, postcolonial theory and in discussions of teaching and pedagogy. The contact zone is similar to other concepts that address relationality and contiguity such as positionality, [[standpoint theory]], perspectivism, [[intersectionality]], and relationality (24).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Multiculturalisms Past, Present, and Future|jstor = 30044661|journal = College English|date = 2005-09-01|pages = 14–41|volume = 68|issue = 1|doi = 10.2307/30044661|first = Marilyn|last = Edelstein|url = http://scholarcommons.scu.edu/engl/91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arts of the Contact Zone ===
In "Arts of the Contact Zone,"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Pratt describes a manuscript from 1613 penned by Andean man named [[Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala]]. The manuscript was a letter written to King Phillip III of Spain and was titled ''The First New Chronicle and Good Government''. The manuscript details Spanish conquest in South America. Pratt cites the manuscript as an example of autoethnography. She writes, “Guaman Poma’s ''New Chronicle'' is an instance of what I have proposed to call an ''authethnographic'' text, by which I mean a text in which people undertake to describe themselves in ways that engage with representations others have made of them” (35).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The ''New Chronicle'' ends with a revisionist account of the Spanish conquest. Pratt uses the manuscript as an example of an oppressed person or group resisting hegemony, and she connects the practice of authoethnography, critique and resistance to the creation of contact zones.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Transculturation ====

[[Mary Louise Pratt|Pratt]] also shares the example of [[Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala|Poma’s]] ''New Chronicle'' to give an example of “'''[[transculturation]]'''” or a term that ethnographers have used “to describe the process whereby members of subordinated or marginal groups select and invent from materials transmitted by a dominant metropolitan culture” (36).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Additionally, Pratt gives the origin of the term “[[transculturation]],” writing, “The term, originally coined by Cuban sociologist Fernando Ortiz in the 1940, aimed to replace concepts of acculturation and assimilation used to characterize
culture under conquest” (36).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Pratt confirms “Transculturation, like autoethnography, is a phenomenon of the contact zone” (36).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Purpose of the Contact Zone ====

Pratt states that one of the purposes of the contact zone is “intended in part to contrast with ideas of community that underlie much of the thinking about language, communication and culture that gets done in the academy” (37).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Pratt takes issue with the notion of communities as “imagined entities” (37)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and that this line of thinking creates a type of problematic nationalism.

=== The Contact Zone in Composition Studies and Education ===
The notion of the contact zone has been used to facilitate discussions within composition studies on the topics of multiculturalism, multilingualism and [[critical pedagogy]]. The contact zone is used by scholars as a trope for visualizing solutions to conflicts. Marilyn Edelstein discussed the contact zone and multiculturalism. In Edelstein’s article, “Multiculturalisms, Past and Present, and Future”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; questions of inclusion verses difference are prominent. In “Professing Multiculturalism: The Politics of Style in the Contact Zone,”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Professing Multiculturalism: The Politics of Style in the Contact Zone|jstor = 358759|journal = College Composition and Communication|date = 1994-12-01|pages = 442–458|volume = 45|issue = 4|doi = 10.2307/358759|first = Min-Zhan|last = Lu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Min-Zhan Lu discussed multilingualism and the contact zone, where the student text is the site of struggle. [[Mary Louise Pratt|Pratt]] also uses the contact zone to discuss the classroom space. Pratt writes, “All the students in the class had the experience... of having their cultures discussed and objectified in ways that horrified them; all the students experienced face-to-face the ignorance and incomprehension, and occasionally the hostility of others ... Along with rage, incomprehension, and pain, there were exhilarating moments of wonder and revelation, mutual understanding, and new wisdom—the joys of the contact zone" (39).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Patricia Bizzell]] went so far as to suggest that English studies be organized around “contact zones” rather than historical periods.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = "Contact Zones" and English Studies|jstor = 378727|journal = College English|date = 1994-02-01|pages = 163–169|volume = 56|issue = 2|doi = 10.2307/378727|first = Patricia|last = Bizzell}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Patricia Bizzell|Bizzell]] proposed, “I am suggesting that we organize English studies not in terms of literary or chronological periods, nor essentialized racial or gender categories, but rather in terms of historically defined contact zones, moments when different groups within the society contend for the power to interpret what is going on” (167).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; [[Patricia Bizzell|Bizzell]] uses the term to refer to moments in space and time, rather than abstract spaces in the mind or in literature. She describes contact zones as “circumscribed in time and space, but with elastic boundaries” (166).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
