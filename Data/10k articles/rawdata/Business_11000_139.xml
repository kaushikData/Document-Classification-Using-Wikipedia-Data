'''Archduke Felix of Austria''' ([[given names]]: ''Felix Friedrich August Maria vom Siege Franz Joseph Peter Karl Anton Robert Otto Pius Michael Benedikt Sebastian Ignatius Marcus d'Aviano''; 31 May 1916 – 6 September 2011) was the last surviving child of the last Austrian Emperor [[Charles I of Austria|Charles I]] and a member of the [[House of Habsburg]]. He was a younger brother of former [[Otto von Habsburg|Crown Prince Otto of Austria]], who predeceased Felix by two months.

==Early life and exile==
Archduke Felix was born in the [[Schönbrunn Palace]] in Vienna the third son of the then [[heir presumptive]] to the throne of [[Austria-Hungary]] the [[Charles I of Austria|Archduke Charles]] and his wife [[Zita of Bourbon-Parma]].&lt;ref name=Lundy/&gt; He was christened at Schönbrunn on 8 June 1916 in the presence of his great-grand uncle Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]] while his godfather was his great-uncle King [[Frederick Augustus III of Saxony]], brother of his grandmother [[Princess Maria Josepha of Saxony (1867–1944)|Princess Maria Josepha of Saxony]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Austrian Heir Given only fifteen names |newspaper=The Day |date=17 July 1916 |page=10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 November 1916 the Emperor Franz Joseph died and Felix's father succeeded as the new Emperor of Austria and King of Hungary.

Archduke Felix was less than three years old when Austria-Hungary collapsed following its defeat in the First World War. As a result, republics were declared in the now-separate countries [[Austria]] and [[Hungary]] which led to exile of the Imperial Family. Originally exiled in Switzerland the Imperial Family were taken to Portuguese island of [[Madeira]] in 1921 after Archduke Felix's father's [[Charles I of Austria's attempts to retake the throne of Hungary|failed attempts]] to claim the throne in the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] from the regent [[Miklós Horthy]]. On 1 April 1922 his father Emperor Charles died in Madeira.

In the autumn of 1937 Archduke Felix was permitted to return to Austria, entering the [[Theresian Military Academy]] in [[Wiener Neustadt]]. He became the first Habsburg since the abolition of the monarchy to pursue a career as an officer in the [[Austrian Army]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lennhoff |first1=Eugene |title=The Last Five Hours of Austria |year=2007 |page=258 |isbn=1-4067-2851-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the [[Anschluss]] approaching Archduke Felix, his sister [[Archduchess Adelheid of Austria|Archduchess Adelheid]] and [[Archduke Eugen of Austria|Archduke Eugen]] fled Austria crossing the border to [[Czechoslovakia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Harding |first1=Bertita |title=Lost Waltz – A Story of Exile |year=2007 |page=256 |isbn=1-4067-3206-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Charge flight from Austria 'Fradulent' |newspaper=Schenectady Gazette |date=30 May 1938 |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Second World War while in the United States, Felix and his brother [[Archduke Carl Ludwig of Austria (1918–2007)|Carl Ludwig]] volunteered to serve in the [[101st Infantry Battalion (United States)|101st Infantry Battalion]] known as the "Free Austria Battalion". However the battalion was disbanded when a number of exiled Jewish volunteers who made up the majority of force ultimately declined to confirm their enlistment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Uncrowned Emperor |last=Brook-Shepherd |first=Gordon |year=2003 |publisher=Hambledon Continuum |isbn=1-85285-439-1 |pages=156 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Return to Austria==
Felix, unlike his brother [[Otto von Habsburg|Otto]], always refused to renounce his rights to the Austrian throne and membership of the Habsburg family, saying that doing so would violate his human rights. As a result, he was banned from entering Austria except for a brief three-day stay in 1989 in order to attend his mother's funeral.&lt;ref name=Bridge/&gt; On 10 March 1996, after Austria had joined the [[European Union]] and the concurrent dropping of staffed border checkpoints between Austria and other EU countries, he crossed into the country from Germany and held a press conference the next day to announce his [[Illegal immigration|illegal arrival]].&lt;ref name=DT&gt;{{cite news|last=Gedye |first=Robin |title=Austria to end law barring Habsburgs from family home |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=1996-04-15 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html=/archive/1996/04/15/waust15.html |accessdate=2008-02-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040904155904/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html=%2Farchive%2F1996%2F04%2F15%2Fwaust15.html |archivedate=4 September 2004 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After his presence became known, he was warned by the Austrian government that he would face prosecution if he ever tried to enter the country illegally again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Habsburg row shakes Austria |work=The Independent |location=UK | date = 1996-03-14 | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19960314/ai_n14033896 | accessdate = 2008-02-15 }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, a deal was reached between Felix, his brother Carl Ludwig and the Austrian government whereby they declared their allegiance to the republic without any reference being made to their rights to the throne or to their membership in the Imperial Family.&lt;ref name=DT/&gt;

In June 1998, in a joint action with his brother Carl Ludwig, Felix attempted to have the properties which were given to their ancestor [[Maria Theresa of Austria]] by her husband [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor]] restored to them after the properties had been taken from the Habsburg family by [[Adolf Hitler]] during the [[Anschluss]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Gimson | first = Andrew | title = Habsburgs seek property 'taken by Nazis' |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London | date = 1998-06-01 | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html=/archive/1998/06/01/whab01.html | accessdate = 2008-02-15 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Felix built up a number of successful businesses in [[Mexico]] and [[Brussels]]&lt;ref name=DT/&gt; and worked as a marketing consultant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=James |first=Barry |title=Son of Last Kaiser Meets Vienna Press : A Habsburg Defies Exile From Austria |work=International Herald Tribune |date=1996-03-12 |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/1996/03/12/duke.t.php |accessdate=2008-02-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061201084859/http://www.iht.com/articles/1996/03/12/duke.t.php |archivedate=1 December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his time in exile Archduke Felix lived in [[Portugal]], Belgium, [[Mexico]] and the United States.&lt;ref name=Bridge&gt;{{cite news | last = Bridge | first = Adrian | title = Habsburg seeks right to return |work=The Independent |location=UK | date = 1996-03-12 | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19960312/ai_n14033541 | accessdate = 2008-02-15 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; He lived in the ''colonia'' of [[San Ángel]] in Mexico City where he died 6 September 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elmanana.com.mx/notas.asp?id=8617 Félix de Hapsburgo - El Mañana - Opinión&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722223737/http://www.elmanana.com.mx/notas.asp?id=8617 |date=22 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was interred in the family crypt in [[Muri Abbey]], near [[Zürich]]. The abbey is a favoured burial place of the Habsburg dynasty, and also contains the remains of his wife and the hearts of his parents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aargauerzeitung.ch/aargau/freiamt/felix-von-habsburg-wird-am-samstag-in-klosterkiche-muri-beerdigt-113713979 Felix von Habsburg wird am Samstag in Klosterkiche Muri beerdigt - Freiamt - Aargau - Aargauer Zeitung&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Felix was married civilly on 18 November 1952 at [[Beaulieu-sur-Mer|Beaulieu]], France, and religiously a day later, to Princess and Duchess Anna-Eugénie of [[Arenberg]] (1925–1997).&lt;ref name=Lundy&gt;{{cite web | last = Lundy | first = Darryl | title = Felix Ferdinand Erzherzog von Österreich | publisher=The Peerage | url = http://www.thepeerage.com/p11167.htm#i111664 | accessdate =2008-02-15 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080209161322/http://www.thepeerage.com/p11167.htm| archivedate= 9 February 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had seven children, and twenty-two grandchildren.

'''''Atalanta''''' was a 228-foot [[steam yacht]] built in [[Philadelphia]] by [[William Cramp &amp; Sons]] in 1883 for the financier [[Jay Gould]].  It was sold to the [[Bolivarian Navy of Venezuela|Venezuelan navy]] in 1900 where it served as the gunboat ''Restaurador'' (Restorer).  It was captured by the [[Imperial German Navy|German navy]] during the [[Venezuelan crisis of 1902–03]] and put into service under a German flag as part of the blockading squadron.  After the crisis, it was returned to the Venezuelans.  It was renamed the ''General Salom'' and continued in service until 1950.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

'''''Atlas Shrugged: Part I''''' (referred to onscreen as simply '''''Atlas Shrugged''''') is a 2011 American [[Political drama|political]] [[Science fiction film|science fiction drama film]] directed by [[Paul Johansson]]. An [[film adaptation|adaptation]] of part of [[Ayn Rand]]'s controversial 1957 [[Atlas Shrugged|novel of the same name]], the film is the first in [[Atlas Shrugged (film series)|a trilogy]] encompassing the entire book. After various treatments and proposals floundered for nearly 40 years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Essays on Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged |chapter=Bringing ''Atlas Shrugged'' to Film |last=Britting |first=Jeff |authorlink=Jeff Britting |editor-last=Mayhew |editor-first=Robert |location=Lanham, Maryland |publisher=Lexington Books |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-7391-2780-3 |page=195 |url=http://atlasshrugged.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/adapting_atlas_to_film.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=April 27, 2011|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yGR2t3Zl?url=http://atlasshrugged.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/adapting_atlas_to_film.pdf|archivedate=April 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; investor [[John Aglialoro]] initiated production in June 2010. The film was directed by [[Paul Johansson]] and stars [[Taylor Schilling]] as [[Dagny Taggart]] and [[Grant Bowler]] as [[Hank Rearden]].

The film begins the story of ''Atlas Shrugged'', set in a dystopian United States where [[John Galt]] leads innovators, from industrialists to artists, in a [[capital strike]], "stopping the motor of the world" to reassert the importance of the free use of one's mind and of ''[[laissez-faire]]'' [[capitalism]].&lt;ref name=sfgate&gt;{{cite web|work=SFGate|url=http://www.sfgate.com/movies/article/Atlas-Shrugged-Part-1-review-A-dystopian-tale-2374986.php|title='Atlas Shrugged Part 1' review: A dystopian tale|date=14 April 2011|first=Mick|last=LaSalle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite near universally negative critical response and [[box office bomb|commercial failure]], grossing just under a fourth of its budget, a [[sequel]], ''[[Atlas Shrugged: Part II]]'', was released on October 12, 2012, albeit with an entirely different cast. The third installment, ''[[Atlas Shrugged: Part III|Atlas Shrugged Part III: Who Is John Galt?]]'', was released on September 12, 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title='Atlas Shrugged: Who is John Galt?'

==Plot==
In 2016, the [[United States]] is in a sustained economic [[Depression (economics)|depression]]. Industrial disasters, resource shortages, and gasoline prices at $37 per gallon have made railroads the primary mode of transportation, but even they are in disrepair. After a major accident on the Rio Norte line of the Taggart Transcontinental railroad, CEO [[James Taggart (Atlas Shrugged)|James Taggart]] shirks responsibility. His sister [[Dagny Taggart]], Vice-President in Charge of Operations, defies him by replacing the aging track with new rails made of Rearden Metal, which is claimed to be lighter yet stronger than steel. Dagny meets with its inventor, [[Hank Rearden]], and they negotiate a deal they both admit serves their respective self-interests.

Politician [[Wesley Mouch]]—nominally Rearden's [[lobbyist]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]—is part of a crowd that views heads of industry as persons who must be broken or tamed. James Taggart uses political influence to ensure that Taggart Transcontinental is designated the exclusive railroad for the state of [[Colorado]]. Dagny is confronted by [[Ellis Wyatt]], a Colorado oil man angry to be forced to do business with Taggart Transcontinental. Dagny promises him that he will get the service he needs. Dagny encounters former lover [[Francisco d'Anconia]], who presents a façade of a [[Playboy (lifestyle)|playboy]] grown bored with the pursuit of money. He reveals that a series of [[Copper extraction|copper mines]] he built are worthless, costing his investors (including the Taggart railroad) millions.

Rearden lives in a magnificent home with a wife and a brother who are happy to live off his effort, though they overtly disrespect it. Rearden's anniversary gift to his wife Lillian is a bracelet made from the first batch of Rearden Metal, but she considers it a garish symbol of Hank's egotism. At a dinner party, Dagny dares Lillian to exchange it for Dagny's diamond necklace, which she does.

As Dagny and Rearden rebuild the Rio Norte line, talented people quit their jobs and refuse all inducements to stay. Meanwhile, Dr. Robert Stadler of the State Science Institute puts out a report implying that Rearden Metal is dangerous. Taggart Transcontinental stock plummets because of its use of Rearden Metal, and Dagny leaves Taggart Transcontinental temporarily and forms her own company to finish the Rio Norte line. She renames it the John Galt Line, in defiance of the phrase "Who is John Galt?"—which has come to stand for any question to which it is pointless to seek an answer.

A new law forces Rearden to sell most of his businesses, but he retains Rearden Steel for the sake of his metal and to finish the John Galt Line. Despite strong government and union opposition to Rearden Metal, Dagny and Rearden complete the line ahead of schedule and successfully test it on a record-setting run to Wyatt's oil fields in Colorado. At the home of Wyatt, now a close friend, Dagny and Rearden celebrate the success of the line. As Dagny and Rearden continue their celebration into the night by fulfilling their growing sexual attraction, the shadowy figure responsible for the disappearances of prominent people visits Wyatt with an offer for a better society based on personal achievement.

The next morning, Dagny and Rearden begin investigating an abandoned prototype of an advanced motor that could revolutionize the world. They realize the genius of the motor's creator and try to track him down. Dagny finds Dr. Hugh Akston, working as a cook at a [[diner]], but he is not willing to reveal the identity of the inventor; Akston knows whom Dagny is seeking and says she will never find him, though he may find her.

Another new law limits rail freight and levies a special tax on Colorado. It is the final straw for Ellis Wyatt. When Dagny hears that Wyatt's [[oil field]]s are on fire, she rushes to the scene of the fire where she finds a handwritten sign nailed to the wall that reads "I am leaving it as I found it. Take over. It's yours."

Wyatt declares in an [[answering machine]] message that he is "on strike".

==Production==

===Development===
[[File:Aglialoro (left) with Harmon Kaslow.JPG|thumb|right|alt=|[[John Aglialoro]] (left) and [[Harmon Kaslow]] (right) produced the film.]]
In 1972, [[Albert S. Ruddy]] approached Rand to produce a cinematic adaptation of ''Atlas Shrugged''. Rand agreed that Ruddy could focus on the love story. "That's all it ever was," Rand said.&lt;ref name="NYT-20110417"&gt;{{cite news |last=Dowd |first=Maureen |authorlink=Maureen Dowd |title=Atlas Without Angelina |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/17/opinion/17dowd.html |date=April 17, 2011 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=July 30, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McConnell-Ruddy"&gt;{{Cite book |last=McConnell |first=Scott |title=100 Voices:An Oral History of Ayn Rand |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G7VEd_3b0WUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=100+Voices:+An+Oral+History+of+Ayn+Rand&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ctrnCqa0un&amp;sig=P5wftKQGxHKgqI9-gAZ4oQyX8GE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=skwdUIXNIZSt0AHs_ICAAw&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=ruddy&amp;f=false |publisher=[[Penguin Books]]/[[NAL Trade]] |location=United Kingdom |year=2010 |isbn=0451231309 |page=[[Al Ruddy]] section}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AlRuddy-Interview"&gt;{{cite web |author=Interview Transcript |title=The Making Of The Atlas Shrugged TV MiniSeries |url=http://www.prodos.com/transcript/atlasmovie.html |year=1999 |publisher=Prodos Institute Inc. |accessdate=August 3, 2012 }} Interview with [[Albert Ruddy]], [[Atlas Shrugged#Film and television adaptations|Susan Black]], and [[Bill Collins (television presenter)|Bill Collins]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Rand insisted on having final script approval, which Ruddy refused to give her, thus preventing a deal. In 1978, Henry and Michael Jaffe negotiated a deal for an eight-hour ''Atlas Shrugged'' television [[miniseries]] on [[NBC]]. Jaffe hired screenwriter [[Stirling Silliphant]] to adapt the novel and he obtained approval from Rand on the final script. However, in 1979, with [[Fred Silverman]]'s rise as president of NBC, the project was scrapped.&lt;ref name="brown"&gt;{{cite news |last=Brown |first=Kimberly |title=Ayn Rand No Longer Has Script Approval |newspaper=The New York Times |date=January 14, 2007 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/14/movies/14brow.html |accessdate=June 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rand, a former Hollywood screenwriter herself, began writing her own screenplay, but died in 1982 with only one third of it finished. She left her estate, including the film rights to ''Atlas Shrugged'', to her student [[Leonard Peikoff]], who sold an [[option (film)|option]] to Michael Jaffe and [[Ed Snider]]. Peikoff would not approve the script they wrote and the deal fell through. In 1992, investor [[John Aglialoro]] bought an option to produce the film, paying Peikoff over $1 million for full creative control.&lt;ref name="brown" /&gt;

In 1999, under Aglialoro's sponsorship, Ruddy negotiated a deal with [[Turner Network Television]] for a four-hour miniseries, but the project was killed after the [[AOL Time Warner]] merger. After the TNT deal fell through, [[Howard Baldwin|Howard]] and [[Karen Baldwin]], while running [[Phillip Anschutz]]'s [[Walden Media|Crusader Entertainment]], obtained the rights. The Baldwins left Crusader, taking the rights to ''Atlas Shrugged'' with them, and formed Baldwin Entertainment Group in 2004. [[Michael R. Burns|Michael Burns]] of [[Lions Gate Entertainment]] approached the Baldwins to fund and distribute ''Atlas Shrugged''.&lt;ref name="brown" /&gt; A two-part draft screenplay written by [[James V.

Also, Wallace did not do the screenplay, and Perelman did not direct.&lt;ref name=ebert/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/shrugs-atlas-81709 |title=Shrugs over 'Atlas' are ending |first=Steven |last=Zeitchik |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=April 1, 2009 |accessdate=March 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aglialoro says producers have spent "something in the $20 million range" on the project over the last 18 years.&lt;ref name="slate" /&gt;

===Writing===
In May 2010, [[Brian Patrick O'Toole]] and Aglialoro wrote a screenplay, intent on filming in June 2010. While initial rumors claimed that the films would have a "timeless" setting—the producers say Rand envisioned the story as occurring "the day after tomorrow"&lt;ref name=directors&gt;''Atlas Shrugged'' DVD, Directors' commentary audio channel&lt;/ref&gt;—the released film is set in late 2016.  The writers were mindful of the desire of some fans for fidelity to the novel,&lt;ref name=directors /&gt; but gave some characters, such as [[Eddie Willers]], short shrift and omitted others, such as the composer Richard Halley.  The film is styled as a mystery, with black-and-white [[Freeze-frame shot|freeze frames]] as each innovator goes "missing".  However, Galt appears and speaks in the film, solving the mystery more clearly than in the first third of the novel.

===Casting===
Though director Johansson had been reported as playing the pivotal role of [[John Galt]], he made it clear in an interview that with regard to ''who is John Galt'' in the film, the answer was, "Not me."&lt;ref name="libertasfilmmagazine.com" /&gt; He explained that his portrayal of the character would be limited to the first film as a [[silhouette]]d figure wearing a [[trenchcoat]] and [[fedora]],&lt;ref name="trailer"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6W07bFa4TzM |title= Atlas Shrugged: Part 1 – Official Movie Trailer |publisher= YouTube|date= February 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that another actor will be cast as Galt for the subsequent parts of the trilogy.

===Filming===
Though [[Stephen Polk]] was initially set to direct,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deadline.com/2010/05/atlas-shrugged-rights-holder-sets-june-production-start-whether-or-not-stars-align/ |first=Mike |last=Fleming |title='Atlas Shrugged' Rights Holder Sets June Production Start Whether Or Not Stars Align |date=May 26, 2010 |publisher=Deadline.com |accessdate=May 28, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100529190804/http://www.deadline.com/2010/05/atlas-shrugged-rights-holder-sets-june-production-start-whether-or-not-stars-align/| archivedate= May 29, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was replaced by [[Paul Johansson]] nine days before filming was scheduled to begin. With the 18-year-long option to the films rights set to expire on June 15, 2010, producers Harmon Kaslow and Aglialoro began principal photography on June 13, 2010, thus allowing Aglialoro to retain the motion picture rights. Shooting took five weeks, and he says that the total production cost of the movie came in on a budget around US$10 million,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theatlasphere.com/columns/101123-aglialoro-atlas-shrugged-movie.php |title=John Aglialoro on the Atlas Shrugged Movie |first=Joshua |last=Zader |date=November 23, 2010 |accessdate=March 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; though Box Office Mojo lists the production cost as $20 million.&lt;ref name="mojo" /&gt;

The site's consensus was: "Passionate ideologues may find it compelling, but most filmgoers will find this low-budget adaptation of the Ayn Rand bestseller decidedly lacking."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/atlas_shrugged_part_i |title=Atlas Shrugged Part I |publisher=[[Flixster]] |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=March 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metacritic]] gives the film a "generally unfavorable" rating of 28%, as determined by averaging 19 professional reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/atlas-shrugged-part-i/critic-reviews |title=Critic Reviews for Atlas Shrugged: Part I at Metacritic |work=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some commentators noted differences in film critics' reactions from audience members' reactions; from the latter group, the film received high scores even before the film was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/ideas-market/2011/04/15/atlas-shrugged-is-upon-us/ |title=''Atlas Shrugged'' Is Upon Us |work=The Wall Street Journal |first=Christopher |last=Shea |date=April 15, 2011 |quote=giving the movie five stars, some also admit they haven't actually, you know, seen it yet.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2011/04/15/sorry-objectivists-atlas-shrugged-movie-gets-pummeled-by-critics/ |title=Sorry, Objectivists: Atlas Shrugged Movie Gets Pummeled By Critics |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |first=Megan |last=Gibson |date=April 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20054410-503544.html |title=''Atlas Shrugged'' film adaptation banking on conservative support |publisher=[[CBS News]] |first=Stephanie |last=Condon |date=April 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The poor critical reception of ''Atlas Shrugged: Part I'' initially made Aglialoro reconsider his plans for the rest of the trilogy.&lt;ref name="No wide"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/movies/2011/04/atlas-shrugged-producer-critics-you-won-hes-going-on-strike.html | work = [[Los Angeles Times]] |title= 'Atlas Shrugged' producer: 'Critics, you won.'

If you think you're beat[en], don't go all in. If ''Part 1'' makes [enough of] a return to support ''Part 2'', I'll do it.

In July 2011, Aglialoro planned to start production of ''[[Atlas Shrugged: Part II]]'' in September, with its release timed to coincide with the [[United States elections, 2012|2012 U.S. elections]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/movies/2011/07/atlas-shrugged-part-i-coming-to-dvd-and-blu-ray-in-the-fall.html|title='Atlas Shrugged' heads to DVD this fall – and a sequel won't be far behind|first=Rebecca|last=Keegan|work= [[Los Angeles Times]] |date=July 1, 2011|accessdate=September 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In October 2011, producer Harmon Kaslow stated that he hoped filming for ''Part II'' would begin in early 2012, "with hopes of previewing it around the time of the nominating conventions". Kaslow anticipated that the film, which would encompass the second third of ''Atlas Shrugged'', would "probably be 30 to 40 minutes longer than the first movie."  Kaslow also stated his intent that ''Part II'' would have a bigger production budget, as well as a larger advertising budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= Patrick Gavin | title= New 'Atlas Shrugged' film on the way | url= http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1011/65776.html | work=[[Politico]] | date= October 12, 2011 | accessdate=October 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 2, 2012, Kaslow and Aglialoro, the producers of ''Atlas Shrugged: Part II'', announced a start date for principal photography in April 2012 with a release date of October 12, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= Paul Bond | title= 'Atlas Shrugged Part 2' Starting Production in April | url= http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/atlas-shrugged-part-2-prduction-april-286633 | work=The Hollywood Reporter | date= February 2, 2012 | accessdate=February 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joining the production team was Duncan Scott, who, in 1986, was responsible for creating a new, re-edited version with English subtitles of the 1942 Italian film adaptation of ''[[We the Living]]''. The first film's entire cast was replaced for the sequel.

The sequel film, ''[[Atlas Shrugged: Part II]]'', was released on October 12, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Atlas Shrugged Movie (Official Website) |url=http://www.atlasshruggedmovie.com/|date=October 12, 2012 |accessdate=2012-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics gave the film a 4% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 23 reviews.&lt;ref name="RT-20121014"&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff |title=Atlas Shrugged: Part II (2012) |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/atlas_shrugged_part_ii/ |date=October 19, 2012 |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=October 19, 2012&lt;!-- 10:00am/edt/usa--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; One reviewer gave the film a "D" rating,&lt;ref name="CS-20121012"&gt;{{cite web |last=Baldwin |first=Danny |title=Review: "Atlas Shrugged: Part II – The Strike" |url=http://www.criticspeak.com/review-atlas-shrugged-part-ii/ |date=October 12, 2012 |publisher=''CriticSpeak''|accessdate=October 13, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while another reviewer gave the film a "1" rating (of 4).&lt;ref name="NYPost-20121012"&gt;{{cite web |last=Smith |first=Kyle |title=Saw the film &amp; shrugged|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/movies/saw_the_film_shrugged_fJIj4XwcW2XB6eW0TScgRI|date=October 12, 2012 |publisher=[[NYPost]] |accessdate=October 13, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In naming ''Part II'' to its list of 2012's worst films, ''[[The A.V.

'''The Banking Lobby''' refers to the representatives from various firms and organizations seeking favorable terms from governments for big [[bank]]s and other [[financial service]] companies through [[lobbying]] and [[advocacy group]]s.

The banking lobby generally opposes stricter [[government regulation]] of [[financial markets]] while tending to stress the importance of banks in the economy. Some are concerned, however, that they may seek terms that do not necessarily increase performance of the economy as a whole, but only benefit the large banks.

In the US the [[finance industry|finance]], [[real estate]], and [[insurance industry|insurance industries]] reportedly spent a collective [[Orders_of_magnitude_(currency)#1_billion_to_100_billion|$6.8 Billion]] from 1998 through 2011, far more than any other lobbying sector.&lt;ref name=Huff&gt;{{cite web

The '''Bates family''' is an American political and [[List of banking families|banking family]] from Maine and Massachusetts whose members include a prominent member of the prestigious [[Hellfire Club|Hell Fire Club]], the 26th [[United States Attorney General|U.S. Attorney General]] serving under [[Abraham Lincoln]], the second [[List of Governors of Missouri|Governor of Missouri]], a member of the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] for [[Arkansas Territory|Arkansas]], and a proniment textile tycoon who founded the [[Bates Mill|Bates Manufacturing Company]] and [[Bates College]] in [[Lewiston, Maine|Lewiston]], Maine. The family includes various merchants, politicians, inventors, clergymen, artists, and socialites.

The family is related to the prominent political [[Joseph Gilbert (minister)|Gilbert family]] and indirectly to the [[John Alden|Alden family]], the first family on the [[Mayflower]].

== History ==
=== Early prominence ===
The Bates family most likely originated from [[Lydd, Kent|Lydd]] in [[Kent]], [[England]].&lt;ref name="Firmin"&gt;{{cite book|last=Firmin|first=Lois|date=|title=Ancestors and Descendants of George and Margarte Bates MARTIN|url=http://www.devintimber.org/getperson.php?personID=I4598&amp;tree=dt001|location=|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have lived there since at least the 13th Century.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.geni.com/people/Master-ll-Bate-of-Lydd/6000000018581721056|title= unknown Bate (1299-c.1345)|accessdate= January 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The prominence of the Bates family began with its patriarch, Benjamin Bates I (1651–1710), who worked his way into the legal world as a young boy, in [[Edinburgh West (UK Parliament constituency)|Edinburgh, Scotland]],&lt;ref&gt;Mercer pp.16&lt;/ref&gt; and soon gained a reputation for winning arguments and debates among the most senior councilmen in his town.

The family can trace their ancestors to [[John Alden]] who was crew member on the [[Pilgrim Fathers|historic 1620 voyage]] of the Pilgrim ship ''[[Mayflower]],'' through the union of Elkanah Bates (1779 - 1841) and Hannah Copeland.&lt;ref&gt;Society of Colonial Dames, 1897; Section 75.&lt;/ref&gt; The family assumed their family crest upon their marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Mercer, pp. 13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mercer, pp. 19 (apps. 2)&lt;/ref&gt; Alden's daughter Ruth married John Bass, and were survived by Benjamin, Williams and eventually Hannah Copeland, who began the lineage with the Bates family.&lt;ref&gt;Mercer 12-15&lt;/ref&gt; The Bates family starts in England but moved to and from [[Massachusetts]] periodically, with certain members being born abroad and others being born in [[New England]].

Edward Bates born in [[Goochland County, Virginia]], on the Bates' Belmont plantation, he was privately tutored at home as a boy. When older, he attended Charlotte Hall Military Academy in Maryland. Bates's first foray into politics came in 1820, with election as a member of the state's constitutional convention. He wrote the preamble to the state constitution—an honor that later influenced his fight against the radical Missouri Constitution of 1865. He next was appointed as the new state's Attorney General. He became a prominent member of the Whig Party during the 1840s, where his political philosophy closely resembled that of Henry Clay. While a slaveholder, during this time, Bates became interested in the case of the slave Polly Berry, who in 1843 gained her freedom decades after having been held illegally in the free state of Illinois for several months. In 1850, President [[Millard Fillmore]] asked Bates to serve as [[United States Secretary of War|U.S. Secretary of War]], but he declined. At the Whig National Convention in 1852, Bates was considered for nomination as vice-president on the party ticket, and he led on the first ballot before losing on the second ballot to William Alexander Graham. His brothers [[Frederick Bates (politician)|Frederick]] and [[James Woodson Bates|James Woodson]] also served in politics as Governor of Missouri, and Senator respectively.&lt;ref name="Mercer, pp. 25"&gt;Mercer, pp. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

His wealth was increased considerably, from cotton brought up from the [[Plantation economy|slave plantations]] of [[Alabama]], and [[Mississippi]].&lt;ref name="Mercer pp. 22"/&gt; Elkanah Bates was survived by [[Benjamin Edward Bates IV]], who went on to be one of the most prominent businessmen in the United States and the wealthiest man in Maine for nearly half a century. Benjamin Bates IV was born in [[Mansfield, Massachusetts]] on July 12, 1808, to Hannah Copeland and Elkanah Bates as their third child out of eight. The family has historical ties to the Congregational Church, and both of his parents belonged to the local church in Mansfield. He was privately schooled the Wrentham Academy, at 15 and moved to [[Boston]] in 1829, at age 21.&lt;ref name=":1132"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Bates Student: A Monthly Magazine|last=Johnnett|first=R.

He co-founded the firm of Davis, &amp; Bates in Boston, and his wealth exponentially increased so much so that his overall business engagements quelled the [[Panic of 1837|Manhattan panic of 1837]]'s effects in Maine. His principle accomplishment during his early business career was the establishment of Bates Manufacturing Company. The company went on to be the largest manufacturing company in the state of Maine and provided two-thirds of all textile output for the state.&lt;ref name=":119"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Bates Student: A Monthly Magazine|last=Johnnett|first=R.

Bates' practices with the mill dominated the mill industry and was one of the first great U.S. business trusts.

==== Bates College ====
After being approached by [[Oren Burbank Cheney]], he began offering up the services of his mills, canals, and other holdings in the construction of such an institution. In 1852, he personally pledged another $6,000 to the school. In 1853, Oren Burbank Cheney appointed him as a Trustee of the College and in 1854 subsequently became Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the college due to his considerable donations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bates.edu/150-years/history/progressive-tradition/chapter-1/|title=Chapter 1 {{!}} 150 Years {{!}} Bates College|website=www.bates.edu|accessdate=2015-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went onto donate $25,000 for the foundation of agriculture department and moved a subscription of $75,000 for campus expansion. On February 21, 1873, he donated $100,000 on the condition that the amount was met by third-party donors, within five years. Although he placed conditions on his donations, he realized his donations regardless of the conditions being met.&lt;ref name=":1253"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Bates Student: A Monthly Magazine|last=Johnnett|first=R. F.|publisher=Bates College|year=1878|isbn=|location=Edmund Muskie Archives, Bates College, Lewiston, Maine|pages=Multi-source; pp. 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By his death in 1878, Bates' donations to the College totalled over $100,000, and overall contributions valued at $250,000.&lt;ref name=":1253"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Bates Student: A Monthly Magazine|last=Johnnett|first=R. F.|publisher=Bates College|year=1878|isbn=|location=Edmund Muskie Archives, Bates College, Lewiston, Maine|pages=Multi-source; pp. 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cheney renamed the College after Bates without his knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Mercer, pp. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

Bates wrote to Cheney and noted the naming of the college after him on May 18, 1863, saying:&lt;blockquote&gt;In regard to the name of your college, I can only say that my choice would have been to name it after someone more worthy of its inception and history... I am sorry the Board of Trustees have renamed the college after me as I cannot raise so much money as people may think I am asking money for myself.&lt;ref name=":1253"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;By his death in 1878, Bates had amassed a total [[net worth]] of approximately $79.4 million (worth $1.7 billion in 2016), and as the richest member of the family. The family possessed assets that included his holdings in Maine, New York, and Massachusetts that encompassed the non-operational value of B. T. Loring &amp; Co., Bates, Turner &amp; Co., his holding company the Bates Manufacturing Company, his stake in the Lewiston Water Company, Bates Mill, and miscellaneous banking endeavors in New York. In his Will he pledged $50,000 to his wife Sarah Gilbert along with his 2.8 million dollar estate, $10,000 to his brother William, $10,000 to his brother Elkanah Bates II, $10,000 equally divided among the children of his sister, Charlotte, $10,000 to [[Edward Atkinson (activist)|Edward Atkinson]], and $10,000 to [[George Fabyan|George Fabian]]. He left each of his children, Benjamin Edward V, Lilian, Sarah, and Author $250,000 in the form of a trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Unknown|first=Publisher|date=1879|title=The Will of Benjamin Edward Bates|url=|journal=Boston Herald|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Bates had $200,000 in outstanding debt and a pledged $100,000 to Bates College after his death. His family was required expend the $100,000 pledged but due to conditions placed on the inheritances, restricted distribution, and familial debt, the [[Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts]] eventually ruled that Bates' heirs did not have to pay Bates College the pledged $100,000. After a period of recession the college began to financially recuperate to a larger endowment, independently. Over the next couple of years Bates College's endowment has grown slowly and steadily.

Although much has been speculated on the calculated sum of the families wealth many agree it has fallen below Bates' $79.4 million in 1878.&lt;ref&gt;Mercer, pp. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1994">'''Cyberquery''' is a software product of [[Cyberscience Corporation]] Inc. Originally developed for data handling and analysis on [[Data General]] AOS and AOS/VS minicomputers, then the available platforms for '''Cyberquery''' were extended to all major [[UNIX]] platforms, [[VAX/VMS]], [[Digital Equipment Corporation]], [[personal computers]] and Microsoft Windows. 

==Description of Cyberquery==

Invented in 1980, Cyberquery is a declarative "4GL" [[fourth-generation programming language]]. Its early design was slightly influenced by RAMIS and other data access and analysis languages such as the query language on GE time sharing systems. Cyberquery automates the process of accessing files or tables and reading records or rows. This basic operation allows the user/developer to concentrate on the details of working with the data within each record, in effect working almost entirely within an implicit [[program loop]] that runs for each record. Compared to [[general-purpose programming language]]s, this automation allows the user/developer to ignore the technical details of the data and how it is stored, and concentrate on the information contained in the data.

Cyberquery has a data dictionary to describe the datasets users wish to access. This removes all the physical details of the file structure from each program and from the user/developer. The original target customers for Cyberquery were personnel departments, so ease of use by non computer specialists was an early design goal. This architecture had the advantage that Cyberquery is portable, reports written for one database run unmodified on any other provided the underlying data is logically similar. Differences are hidden in the data dictionary. Cyberquery is now widely deployed in Industries including Manufacturing, Finance, Medical and Retail.

In 1995, [[Jay Chiat]] sold his agency network to [[Omnicom Group|Omnicom]] with the intention to globally merge Chiat/Day with [[TBWA Worldwide|TBWA]]. In the UK, client conflicts prompted an employee buy-out of the business, led by Andy Law and Abraham,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/me-and-my-partner-andy-law-and-david-abraham-1072895.html|title=Me And My Partner: Andy Law and David Abraham|website=The Independent|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; who became Chief Operating Officer.

During his tenure, he oversaw launches of [[Dave (TV channel)|Dave]], [[Alibi (TV channel)|Alibi]], [[Watch (TV Channel)|Watch]], [[Yesterday (TV channel)|Yesterday]] and [[Really (TV channel)|Really]].

==Channel Four==
Abraham succeeded interim chief executive [[Anne Bulford]] in May 2010 following a period of relative uncertainty at [[Channel 4]] involving a debate about the organisation's self-sufficiency, leading to what was described as a 'public begging bowl'  strategy. Abraham was appointed by incoming chairman [[Terence Burns, Baron Burns|Lord Terry Burns]].

Abraham became immediately involved in programming issues such as whether [[Jonathan Ross]] should return,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/mar/19/jonathan-ross-channel-4|title=Jonathan Ross chatshow deal shelved by Channel 4|last=Plunkett|first=John|date=2010-03-19|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in defending a controversial [[Frankie Boyle]] sketch about [[Katie Price]]'s family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/nov/02/frankie-boyle-sketches-broadcast-racist|title=Frankie Boyle sketches 'wouldn't have been broadcast if they were racist'|last=Plunkett|first=John|date=2 November 2012|work=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abraham assembled a new leadership team including appointing [[Jay Hunt (television executive)|Jay Hunt]] from [[BBC One]] as chief creative officer to revive programming.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/sep/14/jay-hunt-channel-4|title=Channel 4 appoints Jay Hunt as chief creative officer|last=Brown|first=Maggie|date=14 September 2010|work=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next few years, Channel 4's programmes included ''24 Hours in A&amp;E'', ''The 2012 Paralympic Games'', ''The Grand National'', ''Black Mirror'', ''Gogglebox'', ''The Last Leg'', ''Humans'', ''The Undateables'', ''Educating Yorkshire'', ''The Island'', ''Indian Summers'', ''Southcliffe'', ''UKIP; The First 100 Days'', ''Sri Lanka's Killing Fields'', ''Benefits Street'', ''Big Fat Gypsy Weddings'' and ''MPs For Hire''.

In 2010 and 2014, Channel 4 was named Channel of the Year at the [[Edinburgh International Television Festival]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/aug/23/channel-4-channel-year-edinburgh-tv-festival|title=Channel 4 wins channel of the year at Edinburgh TV festival|last=Plunkett|first=John|date=23 August 2014|work=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by ''[[Broadcast (magazine)|Broadcast]]'' magazine in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-35548079|title=Channel 4 wins Channel of the Year at Broadcast Awards|publisher=BBC News|access-date=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2015, Abraham and Hunt struck a three-year deal with [[Bernie Ecclestone]] to broadcast [[Formula One]] on Channel 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/2b7fe040-a7dc-11e5-955c-1e1d6de94879.html#axzz41MyHnTUa|title=Channel 4 snaps up live F1 after BBC ditches TV coverage|last=Mance|first=Henry|date=21 December 2015|work=Financial Times|issn=0307-1766|access-date=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2015, Channel 4 launched new online hub All 4, offering live streaming, shortform and 'box-set' content, and replacing 4oD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/sep/11/channel-4-replace-4od-new-online-hub-streaming-tablets-smartphones|title=Channel 4 to replace 4oD with new online hub All 4|last=Sweney|first=Mark|date=11 September 2014|work=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2016, a new foreign language drama service called Walter Presents was launched on All 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitaltveurope.net/380871/channel-4-to-roll-out-new-vod-service-4world-drama/|title=Channel 4 to roll out new VoD service 4World Drama » Digital TV Europe|website=www.digitaltveurope.net|access-date=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abraham increased funding for [[Film4]] in 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/film-4-renaissance-set-to-continue-1964118.html|title=Film 4 renaissance set to continue|website=The Independent|language=en-GB|access-date=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and again in 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.screendaily.com/news/film4-funding-increased-to-record-36m-signs-fox-searchlight-deal/5100007.article?referrer=RSS|title=Film4 funding increased to record $36m; signs Fox Searchlight deal|website=www.screendaily.com|access-date=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the film division led by [[Tessa Ross]] and subsequently David Kosse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/aug/04/film4-appoints-david-kosse-as-director-to-succeed-tessa-ross|title=Film4 appoints David Kosse as director to succeed Tessa Ross|last=Pulver|first=Andrew|date=4 August 2014|work=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 Abraham appointed [[Daniel Battsek]] to lead Film 4 following the leaving of David Kosse to join [[STX Entertainment|STX]].

== Wonderhood Studios ==
In April 2018, Abraham announced&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/david-abraham-wonderhood-studios-channel-4-1202756824/|title=Former Channel 4 Chief David Abraham Launches Wonderhood Studios|last=Clarke|first=Stewart|date=2018-04-18|work=Variety|access-date=2018-04-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; the launch of a new company, Wonderhood Studios. The stated aims of the business are to forge a new model in the creative industries by bringing together skills and capabilities that until now have operated separately. The new company will be structured in the form of adjacent studios: one will produce ambitious programming across multiple genres for broadcasters and platforms while another will serve as a full-strength creative agency for major brands. Both studios will be supported by a third specialism in media data insight and the development of future digital networks.  

== Media industry contributions ==
In May 2011, Abraham set out his planned vision for Channel 4 at a [[Royal Television Society]] event in which he stressed the importance of its organisational independence and how it would keep innovating both editorially and technologically.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/may/24/david-abraham-rts-speech-full|title=David Abraham's Royal Television Society speech: full text|date=2011-05-24|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the occasion of the 30th Anniversary of Channel 4 in 2012, he delivered a speech at the Freeword Centre London entitled: Freedom of Expression and Free Television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.englishpen.org/campaigns/freedom-of-expression-and-free-television-david-abraham-speech/|title=Freedom of Expression and Free Television - David Abraham Speech - English PEN|website=English PEN|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 Abraham chaired the Royal Television Society Cambridge Convention during which he announced a new £20m Growth Fund for UK independent production companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/9d111ccc-2887-11e4-9ea9-00144feabdc0.html#axzz45VS4aCn8|title=Channel 4 takes stakes in TV programme makers|last=Mance|first=Henry|date=2014-08-21|newspaper=Financial Times|issn=0307-1766|access-date=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This fund has invested in companies such as Lightbox, True North, Arrow, Eleven Films and production entities involving [[Sacha Baron Cohen]] and [[David Coulthard]].

In 2014, Abraham delivered the MacTaggart Lecture at the Edinburgh International Television Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/aug/21/david-abraham-mactaggart-lecture-full-text|title=David Abraham’s MacTaggart lecture - full text|last=Abraham|first=David|date=21 August 2014|work=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theme of the lecture addressed the continuing importance of public service broadcasting in the UK in an age of global and technological consolidation. The lecture caused debate within the media industry and was characterised by some as a critique of American ownership of UK media assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/david-abraham-big-ideas-for-the-small-screen-9686810.html|title=David Abraham: Big ideas for the small screen|work=The Independent|language=en-GB|access-date=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6140">{{short description|Satirical observation by Dilbert cartoonist Scott Adams}}
The '''Dilbert principle''' is a concept in [[management]] developed by [[Scott Adams]], creator of the comic strip ''[[Dilbert]]'', which states that companies tend to systematically promote [[Competence (human resources)|incompetent]] employees to management to get them out of the workflow. The Dilbert principle is inspired by the [[Peter principle]], which holds that employees are promoted based on success in their current position until they reach their "level of incompetence" and are no longer promoted. Under the Dilbert principle, employees who were never competent are promoted to management to limit the damage they can do. Adams first explained the principle in a 1995 ''[[The Wall Street Journal|Wall Street Journal]]'' article, and expanded upon it in his 1996 business book ''The Dilbert Principle''.

==Definition==
In the ''Dilbert'' strip of February 5, 1995, [[Dogbert]] says that "leadership is nature's way of removing morons from the productive flow". Adams himself explained,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Funny Business |author= |url=http://www.aacsb.edu/publications/bized/p16-21.pdf |newspaper=BizEd |date=November–December 2002 |accessdate=April 23, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206065944/http://aacsb.edu/publications/bized/p16-21.pdf |archivedate=February 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;I wrote ''The Dilbert Principle'' around the concept that in many cases the least competent, least smart people are promoted, simply because they’re the ones you don't want doing actual work. You want them ordering the doughnuts and yelling at people for not doing their assignments—you know, the easy work. Your heart surgeons and your computer programmers—your smart people—aren't in management. That principle was literally happening everywhere.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Adams explained the principle in a 1995 ''[[The Wall Street Journal|Wall Street Journal]]'' article.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Scott. "Manager's journal: The Dilbert principle." ''Wall Street Journal''  [New York, N.Y.] 22  May 1995, Eastern edition: A12. ''Wall Street Journal''.&lt;/ref&gt; Adams then expanded his study of the Dilbert principle in his 1996 book ''The Dilbert Principle'', which is required or recommended reading at some management and [[Master of Business Administration|business programs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mot.berkeley.edu/Berkeley_Students/Students/Courses/Course_Descriptions/proj_mgmt_syll.pdf |title=Project Management Case Studies |work=Haas School of Business |publisher=University of California, Berkeley |date=2003 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313051719/http://mot.berkeley.edu/Berkeley_Students/Students/Courses/Course_Descriptions/proj_mgmt_syll.pdf |archivedate=March 13, 2012  |accessdate=October 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~hendrixs/classes/readings.html |title=Readings for CSCI 3308 - Software Engineering Methods and Tools |publisher=University of Colorado Boulder |date=March 16, 2001 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060922194230/http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~hendrixs/classes/readings.html |archivedate=September 22, 2006 |accessdate=October 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vancouver.wsu.edu/fac/holt/em501/em501.htm |title=Syllabus - SW Project Mgt - CSE5315 - 1998 |accessdate=2010-02-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030220024018/http://www.vancouver.wsu.edu/fac/holt/em501/em501.htm |archivedate=February 20, 2003 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vancouver.wsu.edu/fac/holt/em501/em501.htm |title=EM 501 Management of Organizations |publisher=Washington State University |date=2000 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209050420/http://www.vancouver.wsu.edu/fac/holt/em501/em501.htm |archivedate=February 9, 2010 |accessdate=October 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the book, Adams writes that, in terms of effectiveness, use of the Dilbert principle is akin to a band of gorillas choosing an alpha-squirrel to lead them. The book has sold more than a million copies and was on the ''New York Times'' bestseller list for 43 weeks.

Adams' presentation of the principle is [[satire|satirical]]—facetious but also addressing a real-world concern.

==Comparative principles==
The Dilbert principle is comparable to the [[Peter principle]]. As opposed to the Dilbert principle, the Peter principle assumes that people are promoted because they are competent, and that the tasks higher up in the hierarchy require skills or talents they do not possess. It concludes that due to this, a competent employee will eventually be promoted to, and then remain at, a position at which he or she is incompetent. In his book, ''The Peter Principle'', [[Laurence J. Peter]] explains "percussive sublimation", the act of kicking a person upstairs (i.e., promoting him to management) to get him out of the way of productive employees.

The Dilbert principle, by contrast, assumes that hierarchy just serves as a means for removing the incompetent to "higher" positions where they will be unable to cause damage to the workflow, assuming that the upper echelons of an organization have little relevance to its actual production, and that the majority of real, productive work in a company is done by people lower in the power ladder. Unlike the Peter principle, the promoted individuals were not particularly good at any job they previously held, so placing them in a supervisory position is a way to quietly remove them from the workforce without actually firing them, rather than a reward for meritorious service. An earlier formulation of this effect was known as [[Putt's Law]].

'''Elias Charles Disney''' (February 6, 1859{{spaced ndash}}September 13, 1941)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://billiongraves.com/grave/Elias-Disney/19970346|title=Elias Disney (1859-1941) Grave Site {{!}} BillionGraves|website=BillionGraves|language=en|access-date=2017-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the father of [[Roy O. Disney|Roy]] and [[Walt Disney]].

==Early life==
Disney was born at the rural village of [[Morris-Turnberry, Ontario|Bluevale]], in what is now [[Ontario]], Canada, to [[Irish people|Irish]] [[Irish Protestants|Protestant]] immigrants Kepple Elias Disney (1832–1891) and Mary Richardson (1838–1909). Both parents had emigrated from [[Ireland]] to Canada as children, accompanying their parents.&lt;ref name="Barrier3"&gt;Barrier (2007), p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

He became a farmer and a businessman with little success. He moved to [[California]] with his father in 1878 in hopes of finding [[gold]]. Instead, Kepple was convinced by an agent of the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] to buy {{convert|200|acre|ha}} of land near [[Ellis, Kansas|Ellis]], [[Kansas]]. Disney was an ardent [[socialist]] and a supporter of [[Eugene Debs]].&lt;ref&gt;Schlosser. Fast Food Nation. p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Barrier4"&gt;Barrier (2007), p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ellis, Elias attempted to live as an orange grower and failed.&lt;ref name="Barrier3"&gt;Barrier (2007), p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
[[Image:Elias-Disney.jpg|thumb|right|Elias' son, Walt, paid tribute to his father with a small sign on his Main Street USA attraction at Disneyland which is still in place today. It reads, "ELIAS DISNEY, CONTRACTOR, EST. 1895."]]

Disney worked on his father's new farm until 1884, when he left to find another job. He was hired in a railroad machine shop (one of his co-workers was [[Walter Chrysler]]), then he joined the railroad crew building the Union Pacific line through [[Colorado]]. After the railroad contract was over, he became a professional [[fiddle]] player in [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]]. Again he was unsuccessful, and he returned to his father's farm.  He also worked for a short time as a mailman in [[Kissimmee]], Florida, close to the eventual site of [[Walt Disney World]]. Disney did also attempt to make a career as an orange grower in Florida, but he was unsuccessful &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barrier|first1=Michael|title=The Animated Man|date=2007|publisher=University of California Press|location=Los Angeles, California|isbn=978-0-520-24117-6|page=12 of 393}}&lt;/ref&gt; As one can see{{weasel inline|date=November 2016}} from his attempts at being self-employed, Elias had entrepreneurial tendencies—tendencies that his son, Walt, later would inherit and develop.

He was a construction worker for the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in Chicago, an event which author [[Erik Larson (author)|Erik Larson]] cites as a source of inspiration for his son Walt and the Disney kingdom he would eventually create.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.randomhouse.com/crown/devilinthewhitecity/fair.html | title=The Devil In The White City | first=Erik | last=Larson | publisher=[[Random House]] | accessdate=2009-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; He bought shares of O-Zell Company, a jelly-canning factory that also produced apple juice in Chicago, where his son Walt Disney worked before he joined the Red Cross Ambulance Corps in World War I.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barrier|first=Michael|title=The Animated Man - A life of Walt Disney|year=2007|publisher=University of Los Angeles Press|location=Los Angeles|isbn=978-0-520-24117-6|pages=19–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Disney married [[Flora Call Disney|Flora Call]] on January 1, 1888, in Kismet, Lake County, FL {{convert|50|mi|km}} north of the land on which [[Walt Disney World]] would eventually be built and lived for a short time in adjoining [[Acron, Florida|Acron]], [[Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.randomhouse.com/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780307265968&amp;view=excerpt ''Walt Disney'' by Neal Gabler - eBook - Random House] at www.randomhouse.com&lt;/ref&gt; She was the daughter of his father's neighbors.

Soon after marriage, the Disneys moved to [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], [[Illinois]], where Elias met and befriended [[Walter Parr]], St. Paul Congregational Church's preacher for whom the Disneys' fourth son, Walt, was named. Elias' son Raymond Arnold Disney named his son Charles Elias Disney after his father Elias Charles Disney.&lt;ref name="Barrier4"&gt;Barrier (2007), p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

The couple had five children:
*Herbert Arthur Disney (December 8, 1888 – January 29, 1961, aged 72)
*Raymond Arnold Disney (December 30, 1890 – May 24, 1989, aged 98)
*[[Roy O. Disney|Roy Oliver Disney]] (June 24, 1893 – December 20, 1971, aged 78)
*[[Walt Disney|Walter "Walt" Elias Disney]] (December 5, 1901 – December 15, 1966, aged 65)
*Ruth Flora Disney (December 6, 1903 – April 7, 1995, aged 91)

==Wanderings==
By 1890, the Disneys lived at 3515 South Vernon Avenue in the Fourth Ward. Elias worked as a carpenter.&lt;ref name="Barrier"&gt;Barrier (2007), p. 9-10&lt;/ref&gt; On October 31, 1891, Elias bought a lot at '''1249 Tripp'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thewaltdisneybirthplace.org/|title=Home - The Walt Disney Birthplace|work=The Walt Disney Birthplace|accessdate= May 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1892 he built a house on it. The neighborhood was called Hermosa and had been settled by Scottish, German, and Scandinavian immigrants. Their younger three children were born there. [http://www.thewaltdisneybirthplace.org/]&lt;ref name="Barrier"&gt;Barrier (2007), p. 9-10&lt;/ref&gt;

By the turn of the century, Elias had become an active building contractor. He built houses which he owned and then resold. He also built the Saint Paul Congregational Church, a building dedicated on October 14, 1900. Elias was one of the church's trustees, while his wife was its treasurer.&lt;ref name="Barrier4"&gt;Barrier (2007), p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

According to some sources,{{who|date=November 2016}} Disney worried about the rising criminality of the city. A neighboring family had two adolescent children involved in a car barn robbery, and Elias feared that crime would taint his own children.&lt;ref name="Barrier"&gt;Barrier (2007), p. 9-10&lt;/ref&gt; In 1906 he moved with his family to a farm near [[Marceline, Missouri|Marceline]], [[Missouri]]. Elias and his family settled there in April, 1906. On March 5, he bought a {{convert|40|acre|ha|adj=on}} farm. Its previous owner William E. Crane had died in November, 1905. Crane was a veteran of the [[American Civil War]] and his house predated the foundation of Marceline.&lt;ref name="Barrier"&gt;Barrier (2007), p. 9-10&lt;/ref&gt; He bought the farm for $3,000 or $75 per acre. On April 3, Elias bought an adjoining tract of about {{convert|5|acre|ha|0}} from Crane's widow. He paid an additional $450.&lt;ref name="Barrier"&gt;Barrier (2007), p. 9-10&lt;/ref&gt;

Marceline was probably{{weasel inline|date=November 2016}} chosen for being accessible from Chicago, for its rural setting, and because his younger brother Robert owned a {{convert|440|acre|ha|adj=on}} farm west of the city.&lt;ref name="Barrier"&gt;Barrier (2007), p. 9-10&lt;/ref&gt; The Crane Farm had orchards of apples, peaches, and plums, and fields of grain. The farm animals included pigs, chickens, horses, and cows.&lt;ref name="Barrier2"&gt;Barrier (2007), p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; The Disneys had a telephone connection by 1907.&lt;ref name="Barrier2"&gt;Barrier (2007), p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Herbert and Raymond Disney never liked life on the farm. They moved out around the fall of 1908, heading back to Chicago. They found work as clerks.&lt;ref name="Barrier5"&gt;Barrier (2007), p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1907, Elias convinced some of his fellow farmers to join the American Society of Equity, a farmer's union aiming to consolidate the members' buying power.&lt;ref name="Barrier7"&gt;Barrier (2007), p. 16-17&lt;/ref&gt;

The family sold the farm on November 28, 1910, as Elias fell ill. He was suffering from [[typhoid fever]], followed by [[pneumonia]].&lt;ref name="Barrier7"&gt;Barrier (2007), p. 16-17&lt;/ref&gt;  The Disneys lived in a rented house in Marceline, probably at 508 North Kansas Avenue. Until 1911, when they moved to [[Kansas City, Missouri]]. They lived in a rented house at 2706 East Thirty-first Street. They stayed there until they bought their own modest home in September, 1914. It was situated at 3028 Bellefontaine Street.&lt;ref name="Barrier7"&gt;Barrier (2007), p. 16-17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dnr.mo.gov"&gt;{{cite web|title=Disney, Walt, House and Garage|url=http://www.dnr.mo.gov/shpo/nps-nr/78001654.pdf||work=dnr.mo.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 1, 1911, Elias purchased a newspaper delivery route for ''[[The Kansas City Star]]''. It extended from the Twenty-seventh Street to the Thirty-first Street, and from Prospect Avenue to Indiana Avenue. Roy and Walt were put to work delivering the newspapers. The Disneys delivered the morning newspaper ''[[Kansas City Times]]'' to about 700 customers and the evening and Sunday ''Star'' to more than 600. Their customers increased with time.&lt;ref name="Barrier8"&gt;Barrier (2007), p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Elias also delivered butter and eggs to his newspaper customers. They were imported from a dairy farm in Marceline.&lt;ref name="Barrier9"&gt;Barrier (2007), pp. 19-20&lt;/ref&gt;

Elias sold the paper route on March 17, 1917. He had been investing in the O-Zell Company of Chicago since 1912 and moved back to the city in 1917 to take an active role in its management.&lt;ref name="Barrier9"/&gt; The Disneys rented a flat at 1523 Ogden Avenue.&lt;ref name="Barrier10"&gt;Barrier (2007), p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

He retired from management work in 1920 and moved back to Kansas City. He was again listed as a carpenter.&lt;ref name="Barrier11"&gt;Barrier (2007), p. 27-28&lt;/ref&gt; He moved to [[Portland, Oregon]] by the fall (autumn September–October) of 1921. His son Herbert had earlier moved to this city.&lt;ref name="Barrier12"&gt;Barrier (2007), pp. 29-30&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character==

Disney was a member of the Congregational Church and often preached stern sermons on Sundays in this church. His son, Walter Elias Disney, was named after a Congregationalist minister named Walter Parr. Walt's middle name was after his father, Elias Charles Disney. Elias and Walt had a tense relationship as Elias never saw Walt's profession as an artist as a real job.&lt;ref name="BT"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Thomas|first1=Bob |title=Building a Company|date=1998|publisher=Hyperion|location=New York|isbn=0-7868-6200-9|page=15 of 359|edition=First}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elias' son Raymond Arnold Disney named his son Charles Elias Disney after his father Elias Charles Disney.  Elias [[Teetotalism|never drank alcohol]] and rarely smoked.&lt;ref name="Barrier4"&gt;Barrier (2007), p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; According to biographical accounts, Disney was a stern man who could have a strong temper at times,&lt;ref name="Barrier5"&gt;Barrier (2007), p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; and would take the money his sons earned for "safekeeping", considering them too young to know the value of money. If his children misbehaved, Elias would not hesitate to punish them with a switch.&lt;ref name=BT/&gt;

Elias would talk socialism with strange characters and bring them home. He was a fiddler and would bring home anyone else who could play an instrument.&lt;ref name="Barrier6"&gt;Barrier (2007), p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hans Mortensen''' (born 2 September [[1943]] at [[Tórshavn]], [[Faroe Islands]]), is a retired [[Faroe Islands|Faroese]] [[Businessperson|businessman]] and [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneur]]. He is famous for founding and managing the biggest department store in [[Tórshavn]], [[SMS]], and is also recognised for his contribution in introducing trade and business terminology into the [[Faroese language]]. Between 1963 and 1976 he was a driving force in developing elite handball in the Faroe Islands.

== Personal life ==
Mortensen was born and raised in Tórshavn in the Faroe Islands. He is the son of business owners Niels Gustav Mortensen (1913 – 1987) and Ebba Mortensen (1920 – 2000), who each ran trading businesses in one of the older trading quarters of Tórshavn between 1952 and 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pfformula.ipapercms.dk/SMS/SMSbl/SMSbl2012/SMSbloktober2012/|title=SMS : Hans Mortensen|date=November 2012|website=Pfformula.ipapercms.dk|accessdate=7 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, he married Birgit Mortensen (née Sivertsen), and together they had a daughter, Elisabeth Mortensen and a son, Niels Mortensen. Niels Mortensen took over as CEO of SMS after his father stepped down from the position in 1996, and as a member of its board after Mortensen retired in 2007. After being a widower since 2001, Mortensen remarried in 2007 with Marjun á Plógv.

== Education ==
After completing primary and secondary school, Mortensen received his Upper Secondary diploma from [[Føroya Millum- og Realskúli]] and took on an apprenticeship at Føroya Banki (now [[BankNordik]]). In 1967, Mortensen graduated from the [[Niels Brock]] business school in [[Copenhagen]] and shortly after started working at the [[Magasin du Nord]] department store on [[Kongens Nytorv]] in Copenhagen. After two years at the department store, Mortensen returned to the Faroe Islands to found his own business and improve the lagging business conditions in the country.

== Sport ==
Mortensen’s life-long commitment to Faroese elite [[handball]] began in the 1960s and 1970s. In 1963, at the age of 18, Mortensen became the president of the Tórshavn handball club [[Neistin]] and immediately initiated the construction of a club venue, completed in the following year. The venue was crucial to the club’s subsequent popularity and success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hvannrok.fo/2016/03/30/neistaeldsalin-hans-mortensen-var-framsiggin-hondboltsleidari/|title=Neistaeldsálin Hans Mortensen var framsíggin hondbóltsleiðari - Hvannrók|website=Hvannrok.fo|accessdate=7 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, Mortensen played on the first Faroese men’s national handball team. In 1976, Mortensen was head coach for the men’s national handball team when they achieved good results during the Men’s Handball World Championship 1976 Group C in [[Portugal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.todor66.com/handball/World/Men_C_1976.html|title=Men Handball World Championship 1976 Group C Portugal - 26.11-01.12 Winner Portugal|first=Todor|last=Krastev|website=Todor66.com|accessdate=7 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
After completing his education in [[Denmark]], Mortensen ran his own retail business in his parents’ premises in central Tórshavn. But in 1970, Mortensen organised the first of many trade fairs in the Faroe Islands. A few attempts had been made earlier at arranging similar events in 1968 in Klaksvík.&lt;ref&gt; Cf. Tingakrossur no. 29 – 26 July 1968, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; The popularity of the trade fairs showed that demand for the Faroese market was bigger than the market was capable of supplying at the time.

Most businesses were located in central Torshavn, and increasing traffic and construction was causing congestion. Tórshavn's city council was therefore planning to establish a shopping street as an extension of a new pharmacy at the outskirts of the city centre to divert some of the traffic.&lt;ref&gt;Dagblaðið no. 43 – 28 juli 1976, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hoydal, Gunnar: Sosialurin no. 78 – 7 July 1984, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon learning of the city plans and the reasons behind them, Mortensen suggested privatising the project in order to further promote business. After initial internal disputes, Mortensen was granted permission to build his department store, which would enable customers to run various errands in a single location.

Mortensen hired Danish architect Flemming Hansen to design a progressive department store, whose architecture would still be rooted in traditional Faroese building style. Construction began in 1976, and the department store SMS opened to the public on November 2nd, 1977. Mortensen was CEO of SMS from 1976 to 1996 and majority shareholder until 2007, when he sold all his shares to his son Niels Mortensen. Niels Mortensen has since then developed the business further. Today the SMS Group includes three shopping centers, three chain stores, a number of partnerships and a microbiological laboratory.

== Business and visions ==
Mortensen’s visions have been characterised by both progressiveness and traditionalism. The department store SMS was designed to resemble traditional Faroese boathouses, and Faroese shop names and business terminology was developed by taking into account common citizen and customer opinions, often through public naming competitions. Over time, the previous predominately Danish business terminology was replaced by newly created Faroese terminology, which continues to evolve with the introduction of new terms and technology.

In an effort to combine innovation with historic preservation, Mortensen collaborated with architects Gunnar Hoydal, Mette Skjold, and Ósbjørn Jacobsen in 2012 to create a public proposal on how to continue developing the Tórshavn city centre while maintaining its historic features.&lt;ref&gt;Hoydal, Gunnar et al, Havnin innan fyri Stóragarð: hugsjónir og dreymar, Tórshavn 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards ==
On International Mother Language Day in 2015, Mortensen received the Faroese Mother Language Award for his longstanding contribution to society and language, particularly his innovative approaches to Faroese trade and business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://snar.fo/tema/skaldskapur-og-midlar/modurmalid/modurmalsvirdisloen/|title=Móðurmálsvirðisløn|website=Snar.fo|accessdate=7 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the recent past{{when|date=September 2017}} the problem of removing the deleterious [[iron]] particles from a process stream had a few alternatives. [[Magnetic separation]] was typically limited and moderately effective. Magnetic separators that used permanent magnets could generate fields of low intensity only. These worked well in removing ferrous tramp but not fine paramagnetic particles. Thus high-[[field strength|intensity]] magnetic separators that were effective in collecting paramagnetic particles came into existence. These focus on the separation of very fine particles that are paramagnetic.

The [[electric current|current]] is passed through the coil, which creates a magnetic field, which magnetizes the expanded steel matrix ring. The [[paramagnetic]] matrix material behaves like a magnet in the magnetic field and thereby attracts the fines. The ring is rinsed when it is in the [[magnetic field]] and all the non-magnetic particles are carried with the rinse water. Next as the ring leaves the magnetic zone the ring is flushed and a [[vacuum]] of about – 0.3 bars is applied to remove the magnetic particles attached to the matrix ring.

==Standard operating procedure==
High-gradient magnetic separator is to separate magnetic and non-magnetic particles ([[concentrate]] and [[tailings|tails]]) from the feed [[slurry]]. This feed comes from intermediate [[thickener]] underflow pump through Linear Screen &amp; Passive Matrix. Tailings go to tailing thickener &amp; product goes to throw [[:wikt:launder|launder]] through vacuum tanks.

==Ion separation==
Ion separation is another application of magnetic separation. The separation is driven by the magnetic field that induces a separating force. The force differentiate then between heavy and lighter ions causing the separation. This phenomenon has been demonstrated on test bench and pilot scale.&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell Application Technologies&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Carlyle''' (6 February 1720–October 1780) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[merchant]] who immigrated to [[British Empire|British]] [[Colony of Virginia]] and became a leading landowner and social and political figure in [[Northern Virginia]].  He was a founding trustee and the first overseer of [[Alexandria, Virginia]].

==Biography==

Born in [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]], [[Cumbria]], [[England]], Carlyle was the second surviving son of William Carlyle, an apothecary-surgeon, of a landed Scottish family from Dumfrieshire descended from the [[Lord Carlyle of Torthorwald|Lords Carlyle of Torthorwald]] and Rachel Murray of [[Murraythwaite]], Dumfriesshire.  He immigrated to Virginia in 1741 as a [[factor (agent)|factor]] (agent) of [[England|English]] merchant William Hicks.  He established himself as a merchant at Belhaven, a settlement that had grown up around a tobacco warehouse on the bluff overlooking the [[Potomac River]] that would become [[Alexandria, Virginia]], in 1749.

Carlyle quickly met with financial success and, in 1747, married Sarah Fairfax, cousin of [[Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron]], from one of the most influential families in Virginia.  From 1751–53, he built his house, now [[Carlyle House]], in Alexandria and he also owned thousands of acres of land throughout Virginia, including three plantations. His business ventures included trading with England and the [[West Indies]], retail operations in Alexandria, a [[foundry]] in the [[Shenandoah Valley]], milling, and operation of a [[forge]].  He also undertook a number of civic and religious positions typical of a man of his status.

[[Image:Carlyle tomb.jpg|thumb|200px|Tomb of John Carlyle]]
On 26 January 1754, he was appointed by Virginia's Lieutenant Governor [[Robert Dinwiddie]], major and commissary of the Virginia forces in the [[French and Indian War]].  He was politically well-connected at the time and was friends with future [[President of the United States]] [[George Washington]]. In 1755, Carlyle's house was the initial headquarters for Major-General [[Edward Braddock]] in Virginia during the French and Indian War. The [[Congress of Alexandria]] convened at the house, most likely in the dining room, and here Braddock decided to make an [[Braddock expedition|expedition]] to [[Fort Duquesne]] which would result in his death. He was urged not to undertake the expedition by Washington who was then a volunteer ''[[aide-de-camp]]'' to Braddock.

Following the death of his wife Sarah on 22 January 1761, Carlyle married Sybil West, daughter of prominent Alexandrian Hugh West.

Around 1770, Caryle constructed a plantation house and summer residence in what is now [[Fairlington, Arlington, Virginia]] first called Torthorwald (after his [[Torthorwald|family's ancestral home]] in Scotland) and later changed to Morven (a mythical land of the [[Gaels]] in an [[Ossian]] poem) which stood until 1942.  He used this plantation as a stud farm and operated a grist mill on [[Four Mile Run]] above what is now [[Arlandria, Virginia|Arlandria]].

Carlyle died in 1780 and is buried at the [[Old Presbyterian Meeting House]] in Alexandria.

John Carlyle's only son to survive beyond childhood was George William Carlyle, born in 1766.  He served in the cavalry (3rd Continental Light Dragoons under Lt. Col. William Washington, a cousin of George Washington) and was killed in [[South Carolina]] in the [[American Revolutionary War]] [[Battle of Eutaw Springs]] on 8 September 1781&lt;ref&gt;Documentary History of the American Revolution, Vol. 3 by Robert W. Gibbes, 1853.&lt;/ref&gt; at age 15, less than one year after the death of his father.  John Carlyle's grandson through his daughter Sarah Carlyle, [[John Carlyle Herbert]], inherited Carlyle House in 1781.  Had George William Carlyle lived, he would have been entitled to the dormant [[baron]]y as [[Lord Carlyle of Torthorwald|Lord Carlyle]], after the death of his first cousin [[Joseph Dacre Carlyle]] who died without a son in 1804.

The '''KPMG Building''' is a 25-story, {{convert|100|m|abbr=on}} [[Office#Grading|Class A office building]] located at 55 Second Street in the [[Financial District (San Francisco)|Financial District of San Francisco]], [[California]], designed by [[Heller Manus Architects|Heller Manus]], and completed in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title=Hines Acquires 55 Second Street And 101 Second Street In San Francisco | url=http://www.hines.com/press/releases/09-21-04.aspx | publisher=Hines Interests Limited Partnership | date=21 September 2004 | accessdate=1 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

When the building was first proposed by Jaymont Properties in 1989, the project was called '''One Second Street'''.&lt;ref name="planning"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec2-50-17-237-182.compute-1.amazonaws.com/docs/Decision_Documents/CPC_Motions_and_Resolutions/14542.pdf |title=SAN FRANCISCO PLANNING COMMISSION MOTION NO. 14542 |date=February 12, 1998 |accessdate=November 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development was slowed by the [[early 1990s recession in the United States]] but was eventually approved in February 1998.&lt;ref name="planning"/&gt;

In November 1999, Jaymont sold the development site to a partnership of [[Cousins Properties|Cousins Properties Inc.]] and Myers Development Company for US$22 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/stories/1999/11/15/daily6.html |title=Cousins, Myers close on development site |work=San Francisco Business Times |date=November 17, 1999 |accessdate=November 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Groundbreaking took place in May 2000 and the building was completed in March 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.myersdevelopment.com/050200.htm |title=Cousins and Myers Commence One Second Street: Major Tenants Signed for New San Francisco Office Tower

In September 2004, Cousins/Myers sold the building to an affiliate of [[Hines Interests Limited Partnership]] for US$146.4 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20040921005137/en/CousinsMyers-Partnerships-Sell-San-Francisco-Office-Buildings |title=Cousins/Myers Partnerships Sell San Francisco Office Buildings for $287 Million |publisher=Cousins Properties Incorporated via BUSINESSWIRE |date=September 21, 2004 |accessdate=November 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like many other buildings in the area, 55 Second Street contains a [[public space]], described by the San Francisco Chronicle as "a big room with hardwood floors, skylights and grand leather chairs, like a private club", which is located on a [[mezzanine]] level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Vibrant center of city’s future a good place to grab lunch|url = http://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/nativeson/article/Vibrant-center-of-city-s-future-a-good-place-to-6419684.php|accessdate = 2015-08-02|website = SF Chronicle|publisher = |last = Nolte|first = Carl|date = 2015-08-01|quote = ... most of the streets are sunny and many have public plazas, an amenity the city requires of potential developers.

Here is a big room with hardwood floors, skylights and grand leather chairs, like a private club. The public is welcome to sit, read, eat lunch or just hang out.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Law practice management''' ('''LPM''') is the [[management]] of a [[law practice]]. In the [[United States]], [[law firm]]s may be composed of a single [[lawyer|attorney]], of several attorneys, or of many attorneys, plus support staff such as [[paralegal|paralegals/legal assistants]], [[Secretary|secretaries]] (including [[legal secretary|legal secretaries]]), and other personnel.

Debate over law as a [[profession]] versus a [[business]] has occurred for over a century; a number of observers believe that it is both.&lt;ref&gt;Champ S. Andrews, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/784941 The Law: A Business or a Profession?] (June 1908), ''Yale Law Journal'', Vol. 107, No. 7, pp. 602-610.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy M. Miller, [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=929749 Is Law a Business or a Profession-And Does it Really Matter?] (1994), ''Los Angeles Daily Journal'' Vol. 107, No. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Lippe, [http://www.abajournal.com/legalrebels/article/law_is_both_a_profession_and_a_business--forget_that_at_your_own_peril/ Law Is Both a Profession and a Business—Forget That at Your Own Peril] (January 27, 2011). Legal Rebels, ABA Journal.&lt;/ref&gt;

Law practice management is the study and practice of [[business administration]] in the legal context, including such topics as [[workload]] and [[staff management]]; [[Managerial finance|financial management]]; [[office management]]; and [[marketing]], including [[legal advertising]].

Many lawyers have commented on the difficulty of balancing the management functions of a law firm with client matters.&lt;ref&gt;Anita J. Cicero, as told to Elizabeth Olson. [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/04/jobs/04pre.html Preoccupations: The Tightrope of Managing a Law Office] (January 3, 2009). ''New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Lawyers started practicing centuries ago. Law firms as an institution date back to the 19th century, and in the United States began appearing in the period before the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey C. Hazard, Jr. and Angelo Dondi, ''Legal Ethics: A Comparative Study'' (2004). Stanford University Press, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; predating the development of modern [[management theory]].

Today, the [[George Washington University]] College of Professional Studies (CPS) offers a [[Master of Professional Studies]] and Graduate Certificate in Law Firm Management.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nearyou.gwu.edu/lawfirm/index1.html Master of Professional Studies and Graduate Certificate in Law Firm Management], George Washington University.&lt;/ref&gt;

==ABA Law Practice Division==
The leading organization focused on law practice management is the Law Practice Division of the [[American Bar Association]] which traces its history back to the creation of the ABA Special Committee on Economics of Law Practice by the ABA Board of Governors on July 30, 1957.  In August 1957, when Charles S. Rhyne became President of the ABA, he made one of his major objectives the institution of a “comprehensive program to aid members of the ABA in the field of economics of law practice”.  He appointed the first Committee which consisted of five members and was increased in May of the following year to seven by action of the Board.  The first Chair of the Special Committee was John C. Satterfield of Yazoo City, Mississippi.

The Committee was charged with the duty of laying the groundwork for the development of practical suggestions to lawyers, designed to improve their economic status.  Combined with this, there was to be an increase in coordination of assistance to lawyers in the business phase of the practice of law, achieved by ABA through its staff, committees and sections and by the state and local bar associations.

An early publication from the Committee was ''The 1958 Lawyer and His 1938 Dollar''. Satterfield was elected President of the [[American Bar Association]] in 1961 during which ''The Lawyers Handbook'' was first published and distributed to all attorneys who joined the ABA that year.

By action of the Board of Governors at the ABA Annual Meeting in August 1961, the Special Committee was made a standing committee of the Association and [[Lewis F. Powell]] of Richmond, Virginia, was appointed as the first Chair of the ABA Standing Committee on Economics of Law Practice.  Shortly after the completion of his term as Chair in 1962, he was elected President of the American Bar Association and subsequently became an Associate Justice of the [[United States Supreme Court]] in 1972.

The Standing Committee on Economics of Law Practice published a bimonthly newsletter, Legal Economics News, and more than 30 books and pamphlets, three educational films, and an audio cassette program.  The Committee continued to publish The Lawyer’s Handbook.  The Committee’s staff answered over one hundred inquiries a month from attorneys regarding the application of sound management principles to the law office operation.  In addition, a small group of attorneys led by J. Harris Morgan of Greenville, Texas, Kline Strong of Salt Lake City, Utah, Lee Turner of Great Bend, Kansas and Jimmy Brill of Houston, Texas, traveled throughout the US, presenting programs on law firm management. Their efforts created the need for the Section.

Commencing in 1965 when John D. Connor served as Chair, the Committee presented the first of six National Conferences of Law Office Economics and Management in Chicago, which attracted approximately 500 lawyers throughout the country and several foreign countries.

As activities expanded and lawyer interest in law office management increased, it became apparent that the committee structure could not meet the demonstrated need of American lawyers for assistance in law practice issues and limited the participation and contribution of interested and informed lawyers in the vital economics and efficiency programs of the Association.  Accordingly, two members of the Committee, Robert S. Mucklestone of Seattle, Washington, the former Chair of the Young Lawyers Section, and Richard A. Williams of Little Rock, Arkansas were joined by William J. Fuchs of Haverford, Pennsylvania; John “Buddy” Thomason of Memphis, Tennessee; and  Robert P. Wilkins of Columbia, South Carolina, and commenced efforts to form a section to address the subject of law office economics and management.

Proponents for a new Section originally proposed that the Board of Governors recommend to the House the creation of a Section of Law Office Practice and Efficiency, but after deliberation it was determined that the new Section should be called by the Standing Committee name.  At the ABA Midyear Meeting in Houston, Texas in February 1974, the House of Delegates approved establishing the Section of Economics of Law Practice.  This action culminated a two-year effort to expand the Committee’s work to a much wider lawyer population.

The organizational meeting of the Section was held in April 1974 at the close of the Sixth National Conference of Law Office Economics and Management.  Robert S. Mucklestone of Seattle Washington, who had served as the Chair of the ABA Committee on Economics of Law Practice was elected the new Section chair with 1074 charter members. Those chosen to serve on the initial Section Council were selected from the members of the ABA Committee on Economics of Law Practice and the Committee on Legal Assistants, other ABA contacts, speakers from the National Conferences and attorneys active at the state level.

The current chair of the American Bar Association Law Practice Division is Tom Bolt, a St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands lawyer with BoltNagi PC.

==Other Organizations and Consultants==
The Association of Legal Administrators (ALA) [[professional association]], which was founded in 1971 is another organization that is concerned with law practice management.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alanet.org/about/ About ALA], Association of Legal Administrators.&lt;/ref&gt;

A large number of law practice [[consulting firm]]s also exist. Many [[bar association]]s have a law practice section or division which they allow non-attorney members due to the technical, non-legal basis of law office management.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., the [http://www.michbar.org/lawpractice/ Law Practice Management and Legal Administrators Section] of the [[State Bar of Michigan]]; the [http://www.massbar.org/member-groups/sections/law-practice-management Law Practice Management Section] of the [[Massachusetts Bar Association]]; and the [http://lpmt.calbar.ca.gov/ Law Practice Management and Technology Section] of the [[State Bar of California]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Law practice management includes management of people (clients, staff, vendors), workplace facilities and equipment, internal processes and policies, and financial matters such as collection, [[budgeting]], [[Internal control|financial controls]], [[payroll]], and client [[trust account]]s.

===Software and legal research===
{{Main|Law practice management software}}

Software applications have become increasingly important in modern law practice. Picking the best software for a law office depends on many variables.&lt;ref&gt;Jim Calloway, [http://www.okbar.org/members/map/Picking%20the%20Best%20Law%20Office%20Software.pdf Picking the "Best" Law Office Software] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091229015452/http://www.okbar.org/members/map/Picking%20the%20Best%20Law%20Office%20Software.pdf |date=2009-12-29 }}. Oklahoma Bar Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Law practice management software|Practice management software]], a form of [[customer relationship management]] software, is among the most important, and features and functions of such management software often include case management ([[database]]s, [[conflict of interest]] checking, [[statute of limitations]] checking), time tracking (for billing), [[document assembly]], [[contact management]], and calendaring and [[Docket (court)|docket]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanbar.org/groups/departments_offices/legal_technology_resources/resources/charts_fyis/casemanagementcomparison.html Practice and Case Management Software: Comparison Chart]. American Bar Association.&lt;/ref&gt; Other software used includes [[password]] security, [[disk encryption]], [[mindmapping]], desktop notes, [[word processing]], and [[email management]]. Some firms use modified versions of [[Open-source software|open source]] software.&lt;ref&gt;Steph Kimbro, [http://lawyerist.com/open-source-virtual-law-firm/ Open Source and the Virtual Law Firm] (May 3, 2011). Laywerist.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greg Lambert, [http://www.geeklawblog.com/2009/07/open-source-in-law-firms-unimaginable.html Open Source in Law Firms - Unimaginable or Brilliant?] (July 8, 2009), ''3 Geeks and a Law Blog''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most law firms also subscribe to a [[computer-assisted legal research]] database for [[legal research]]. Such databases provide [[case law]] from [[Law report|case reporters]], and often other legal resources. The two largest legal databases are [[Westlaw]] (part of [[West (publisher)|West]], which is owned by [[Thomson Reuters]]) and [[LexisNexis]], but other databases also exist, such the free [[Google Scholar]],&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Carton, [http://legalblogwatch.typepad.com/legal_blog_watch/2011/01/improved-google-scholar-becomes-more-useful-to-lawyers.html Improved Google Scholar More Useful to Lawyers] (January 18, 2011). ''Law.com''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Geri L. Dreiling, [http://lawyertechreview.com/2011/how-to-use-google-scholar-for-legal-research/ How to Use Google Scholar for Legal Research] (May 11, 2011). ''Lawyer Tech Review''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Courtney Minick and David Tsai, [http://www.sfbar.org/articles/google_scholar.aspx Google Scholar:  A New Way to Search for Cases and Related Legal Publications]. [[Bar Association of San Francisco]].&lt;/ref&gt; and the newer [[Bloomberg Law]], as well as [[Loislaw]] (operated by [[Wolters Kluwer]]) and several smaller databases.&lt;ref&gt;Jill Schachner Chanen, [http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/exclusive_inside_the_new_westlaw_lexis_bloomberg_platforms/ Exclusive: Inside the New Westlaw, Lexis &amp; Bloomberg Platforms] (January 24, 2010). ''ABA Journal''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alyssa Altshuler, [http://www.vsb.org/publications/valawyer/oct01/altshuler.pdf An Overview of Five Internet Legal Research Alternatives to Westlaw and LexisNexis] (October 2011). ''Virginia Lawyer''. Virginia State Bar.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tami Kamin-Meyer, ''Westlaw Versus Lexis: The Debate Rages On'' (2008). ''Plaintiff''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Document automation has also become a crucial part of legal practice management, with companies like Thomson Reuters,  HotDocs (acquired by AbacusNext)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.law.com/legaltechnews/sites/legaltechnews/2017/11/13/abacusnext-acquires-document-automation-company-hotdocs/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=35e92ab8-ab46-45b4-86d7-ce963c2f8ec8&lt;/ref&gt; and HelpSelf Legal (web-based platform)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.helpselflegal.com/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/12/helpself-uses-simple-ai-to-help-those-in-legal-trouble/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://mashable.com/2017/12/15/artificial-intelligence-domestic-violence-restraining-orders/#GdGZX570Xmqi&lt;/ref&gt; providing document automation services that allow lawyers to customize their own interview workflows to merge into legal documents.  These and other sites are incorporating artificial intelligence into their document automation software.&lt;ref&gt;https://mashable.com/2017/12/15/artificial-intelligence-domestic-violence-restraining-orders/#GdGZX570Xmqi&lt;/ref&gt;.  

These document automation tools allow any lawyer to create their own workflows, in the same way that companies like LegalZoom and RocketLawyer offer standardized automated document production for individuals and small businesses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marketwatch.com/story/dont-buy-legal-documents-online-without-reading-this-story-2015-11-23 Article:Don’t buy legal documents online without reading this story]&lt;/ref&gt;.  Some [[bar association]]s and lawyers' organizations have their own software; for example, the American Academy of Estate Planning Attorneys' CounselPro program is designed for [[estate planning]] lawyers and assists in producing [[Will (law)|wills]], [[Trust law|trusts]], and other [[legal document]]s, as well as other documents such as thank-you letters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaepa.com/cpdf.aspx/ American Academy of Estate Planning Attorneys] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091018125101/http://www.aaepa.com/cpdf.aspx |date=2009-10-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Firm personnel===
[[Human resource management]] (managing personnel) is an important aspect of law practice management, and many books and other resources offer advice to firms on this topic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanbar.org/publications/law_practice_home/law_practice_archive/lpm_magazine_articles_v35_is7_pg34.html Resources for Managing Law Firm Personnel - Shape Up! Practice Management Tips for 2010] (November/December 2009). ''Law Practice'' Vol. 35, No. 7, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Law firms often employ a number of non-legal personnel or support staff; according to one figure, the average attorney to non-attorney ratio is 1 to 1.3.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Freedman, How Many Non-Lawyers Does It Take to Run a Law Firm? (2005). Freedman Consulting, Inc. (version of article originally appearing in the ''Pennsylvania Lawyer'' (March/April 2001 issue).&lt;/ref&gt;

Many firms and other organizations employ a professional non-attorney legal administrator, or law firm administrator, to manage non-attorney personnel and the administrative aspects of the firm.&lt;ref&gt;Joel Rose, [http://nysbar.com/blogs/Tipoftheweek/2010/02/role_of_law_firm_administrator.html Role of Law Firm Administrator] (February 18, 2010). ''Law Practice Management Tip of the Week''. [[New York State Bar Association]], Committee on Law Practice Management.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[professional association]] for legal administrators is the Association of Legal Administrators (ALA), founded in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alanet.org/about/ About ALA], Association of Legal Administrators.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the past two decades, the role of legal administrator has changes as duties have expanded and become more complex, and as more firms hired administrators; the ALA grew from less than a thousand members in 1976 to over 8,000 in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weilandco.com/new/article.html Deciding When And How To Effectively Use A Legal Administrator] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120110031330/http://weilandco.com/new/article.html |date=2012-01-10 }}, John P. Weil &amp; Company.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ALA, in 2007 some 76 percent of legal administrators were women in their 40s and 50s. The main duties of legal administrators are the financial, operation, and human resource management of the firm.&lt;ref&gt;Karen Ott Mayer, [http://www.bizjournals.com/memphis/stories/2007/04/30/focus3.html Role of legal administrators changing as duties expand, become more complex] (April 29, 2007). ''Memphis Business Journal''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert W. Denney, [http://www.americanbar.org/publications/law_practice_home/law_practice_archive/lpm_magazine_articles_v34_is3_pg35.html Evolution of the Professional Administrator] (April/May 2008). ''Law Practice'' Vol. 34, No. 3, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Smith and Ashby Jones, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303630404577388180888033106 Practicing Business: Professional Managers Gain Wider Presence at Law Firms] (May 6, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

A legal administrator is similar to an [[office manager]] or [[executive director]], but often with some expanded duties. Depending on the size, needs, and type of law firm, the firm may employ a separate [[database manager]], [[network administrator]], [[marketing director]], [[computer systems]] or [[Information technology management|information technology manager]], [[bookkeeper]], [[accounts payable]] and [[accounts receivable]] clerk, and others.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Freedman, How Many Non-Lawyers Does It Take to Run a Law Firm? (2005). Freedman Consulting, Inc. (version of article originally appearing in the ''Pennsylvania Lawyer'' (March/April 2001 issue).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Los Angeles City Hall''', completed in 1928, is the center of the government of the city of [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], and houses the [[Mayor of Los Angeles, California|mayor's office]] and the meeting chambers and offices of the [[Los Angeles City Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= | title=The Official Web Site of The City of Los Angeles | url=http://lacity.org/YourGovernment/CityCouncil/index.htm | publisher=City of Los Angeles | year=2010 | accessdate=28 May 2010 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20101113064227/http://www.lacity.org/YourGovernment/CityCouncil/index.htm | archivedate=13 November 2010 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is located in the [[Civic Center, Los Angeles, California|Civic Center]] district of [[downtown Los Angeles]] in the city block bounded by [[Main Street (Los Angeles)|Main]], [[Temple Street (Los Angeles)|Temple]], [[1st Street (Los Angeles)|First]], and Spring streets.

==History==
[[File:LosAngelesCityHall1931.JPG|thumb|left|200px|1931 photograph of then new City Hall with the now-demolished 10-story [[International Savings &amp; Exchange Bank Building|International Savings Bank]] to the immediate left.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Scott |first=Charles Fletcher |date=August–September 1931 |title=Los Angeles on Parade |journal=Overland Monthly |volume=89 |issue=8-9 |pages=14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The building was designed by [[The Parkinsons|John Parkinson]], [[John C. Austin]], and [[Albert C. Martin, Sr.]], and was completed in 1928.  Dedication ceremonies were held on April 26, 1928. It has 32 floors and, at {{convert|454|ft|m}} high, is the tallest [[base isolation|base-isolated]] structure in the world, having undergone a [[seismic retrofit]] from 1998 to 2001 so that the building will sustain minimal damage and remain functional after a magnitude 8.2 [[earthquake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |title=Projects |url=http://www.clarkconstruction.com/releases/entry/2211/ |publisher=Clark Construction Group, LLC |year=2010 |accessdate=28 May 2010 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130219200225/http://www.clarkconstruction.com/releases/entry/2211/ |archivedate=February 19, 2013 }} (Archived link, May 12, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; The concrete in its tower was made with sand from each of [[California]]'s 58 counties and water from its 21 historical [[California missions|missions]].&lt;ref name=gss/&gt; City Hall's distinctive tower was based on the shape of the [[Mausoleum of Mausolus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= Kimberly Truhler | title= Out &amp; About--the Art Deco Design of Los Angeles City Hall | url=http://www.glamamor.com/2012/02/out-about-art-deco-design-of-los.html | work=GlamAmor | date=February 13, 2012 | accessdate=13 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and shows the influence of the [[Los Angeles Public Library]], completed shortly before the structure was begun.  An image of City Hall has been on [[Los Angeles Police Department]] badges since 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= | title=LAPD Badge Description | url=http://www.lapdonline.org/search_results/content_basic_view/1125  | publisher=Los Angeles Police Department | year=2010 | accessdate=5 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To keep the City's architecture harmonious, prior to the late 1950s the Charter of the City of Los Angeles did not permit any portion of any building other than a purely decorative tower to be more than {{convert|150|ft|abbr=on}}.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} Therefore, from its completion in 1928 until 1964, the City Hall was the tallest building in Los Angeles, and shared the skyline with only a few structures having decorative towers, including the [[Richfield Tower]] and the [[Eastern Columbia Building]].

City Hall has an [[observation deck]], free to the public and open Monday through Friday during business hours. The peak of the pyramid at the top of the building is an airplane beacon named in honor of Colonel Charles A. Lindbergh, cf [[Lindbergh Beacon (Los Angeles)|Lindbergh Beacon]]. Circa 1939, there was an art gallery, in Room 351 on the third floor, that exhibited paintings by California artists.&lt;ref name="WPA"&gt;{{cite book|author=Work Progress Administration |date=1939 |title=Los Angeles: A Guide to the City and Its Environs |asin=B00XZS6OG8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building was designated a [[Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument]] in 1976.&lt;ref name="LAHCM_list"&gt;{{Cite journal | author=Los Angeles Department of City Planning | date=September 7, 2007 | title=Historic - Cultural Monuments (HCM) Listing: City Declared Monuments | publisher=City of Los Angeles | url=http://www.cityprojectca.org/ourwork/documents/HCMDatabase090707.pdf |format=.PDF| accessdate=5 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 the building was closed during a total $135 million refurbishment which also included upgrading it so it could withstand a magnitude 8.2 earthquake including permitting it to sway in a quake.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.clarkconstruction.com/our-work/projects/los-angeles-city-hall&lt;/ref&gt;

==Previous City Halls==

Prior to the completion of the current structure, the L.A. City Council utilized various other buildings:

* 1850s: used rented hotel and other buildings for City meetings&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{cite news | author=Cecilia Rasmussen | title=City Hall Beacon to Shine Again | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/sep/09/local/me-43908 | work=Los Angeles Times  | date=September 9, 2001| accessdate=13 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1860s: rented adobe house on Spring Street—across from current City Hall (now parking lot for [[Clara Shortridge Foltz Criminal Justice Center]])&lt;ref name="latimes"/&gt;
* 1860s–1884: relocated to [[Los Angeles County Court House]]&lt;ref name="latimes"/&gt;
* 1884–1888: moved to building at South Spring Street and West 2nd Street (site of current [[Los Angeles Times Building]])&lt;ref name="latimes"/&gt;
* 1888–1928: moved to new [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Romanesque Revival]] building on 226-238 South Broadway between 2nd Street and 3rd Street;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Pacific Electric | title=Early Los Angeles City Hall on Broadway | url=http://www.pacificelectric.org/los-angeles-railway/early-los-angeles-city-hall-on-broadway/ | publisher=Pacific Electric Railway Historical Society | date=March 22, 2013 | accessdate=13 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; demolished in 1928 and now site of parking lot between LA Times Parking structure and 240 Broadway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=J Scott Shannon | title= Old Civic Center – south to City Hall  | url=http://losangelespast.blogspot.ca/2009/11/old-civic-center-south-to-city-hall.html | publisher=Los Angeles Past | date=November 22, 2009 | accessdate=13 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
[[File:Los Angeles City Hall building.jpg|thumb|Tallest base-isolated structure in the world, built in 1928. A Neoclassical base with an Art Deco tower. Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument #150.]]
The [[Mayor of Los Angeles]] has an office in room 300 of this building and every Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday at 10:00am, the [[Los Angeles City Council]] meets in its chamber. City Hall and the adjacent federal, state, and county buildings are served by the [[Civic Center (Los Angeles Metro station)|Civic Center]] station on the [[Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority|LA Metro]] [[Red Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Red Line]] and [[Purple Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Purple Line]]. The [[Silver Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Silver Line]] stops in front of the building.

An observation level is open to the public on the 27th floor.  The interior of this floor, comprises a single large and highly vaulted room distinguished by the iconic tall square columns that are far more familiar as one of the building's most distinguishing exterior features.  The Mayor Tom Bradley Room, as this large interior space is named,  is used for ceremonies and other special occasions.

The Los Angeles Dodgers will wear a commemorative uniform patch during the 2018 season celebrating 60 years in the city depicting a logo of Los Angeles City Hall.

==Filming location==
[[File:City Hall, LA, CA, jjron 22.03.2012.jpg|thumb|upright|The City Hall from Hill Street]]
The building has been featured in the following popular movies and television shows:

* ''[[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|Adventures of Superman]]'': The building appears as the ''Daily Planet'' building beginning in the second season of the 1950s TV series. At the time the TV program was broadcast, the show's ''Daily Planet'' building (Los Angeles City Hall) was frequently confused with the similarly designed Pennsylvania Power &amp; Light Building in [[Allentown, Pennsylvania|Allentown]], also built in 1928.  Additionally, the exact design of this building is used as the ''Newstime'' magazine headquarters in the Superman comic books.
* ''[[Alias (TV Series)|Alias]]'': A [[CIA]] [[black ops]] unit is located behind a maintenance door at Civic Station.
* ''[[Dragnet (drama)|Dragnet]]'': The building appears as itself in the TV series. The first episode of ''Dragnet'' (1951) Season 1, Episode 1: "The Human Bomb", Original Air Date: 16 December 1951, was filmed at Los Angeles City Hall. It was embossed on Sgt. Joe Friday's famous badge number 714 that was displayed under the credits.
* ''[[Perry Mason (TV series)|Perry Mason]]'': The City Hall building appears in the view from Perry's office window. This has led viewers of the show to speculate where the fictional office would have been located in downtown Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= | title=Perry Mason office locale | url=http://www.perrymasontvseries.com/pmo_locale.htm| publisher=D M Brockman | year=2007 | accessdate=5 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[L.A. Confidential (film)|L.A. Confidential]]'': The police in the 1997 neo-noir film operate out of the City hall, as well as the police badges featuring a depiction the building itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Tony Reeves | title=Film Locations for L.A. Confidential(1997) | url=http://www.movie-locations.com/movies/l/laconf.html | accessdate=19 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time the film takes place no building in Los Angeles was allowed to be taller than city hall, so the cameras were placed at certain points so that any building taller than city hall would not be seen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=IMDB | title=L.A. Confidential (1997) - Trivia - IMDB) | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119488/trivia | accessdate=19 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Tower of Terror (1997 film)|Tower of Terror]]'': In this 1997 made-for-TV movie, the main character's love interest works at a fictional newspaper, ''The Los Angeles Banner.'' The newspaper's logo is based on the top of the city hall.
* ''[[Adam-12]]'': During the seventh season opening credits montage, City Hall is shown directly at the end, as the building that officers Reed and Malloy drive away from. It is also shown on the embossed badges numbered 744 (Malloy) and 2430 (Reed).
* The 2003 ''[[List of Dragnet (2003 series) episodes|Dragnet]]'' series used the L.A. City Hall building aerial shot and badge throughout its introduction.
* ''[[The War of the Worlds (1953 film)|War of the Worlds]]'': The City Hall was destroyed (albeit by miniature) in the 1953 film version (although the H.G. Wells book has the aliens attacking London, the setting was changed to Los Angeles for the film).
* ''[[V (1984 TV series)|V]]'': The City Hall was destroyed when the Visitors attack earth. The same footage of the tower being destroyed from [[The War of the Worlds (1953 film)|War of the Worlds]] was used but with different energy weapons superimposed.
*  The 1976 film ''[[The Bad News Bears]]'' included a scene both shot and set in the city council chamber that included a close-up of the electronic voting board with the names of the incumbent council members.
* The 1991 music video for [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]'s "[[Diamonds and Pearls (song)|Diamonds and Pearls]]" features City Hall as the primary location.
*  The 2011 film ''[[Atlas Shrugged: Part I]]''.
*  The 2011 series ''[[Torchwood: Miracle Day]]'' used the main entrance of City Hall to represent the C.I.A. Archive [[Esther Drummond]] visits in "[[The New World (Torchwood)|The New World]]", and the exterior to the medical conference where [[Vera Juarez]] meets [[Jilly Kitzinger]] in "[[Rendition (Torchwood)|Rendition]]"/"[[Dead of Night (Torchwood)|Dead of Night]]".
* The 2013 film ''[[The Employer (2013 film)|The Employer]]'' uses City Hall as the headquarters of the fictional Carcharias Corporation.
* The 2013 film ''[[Gangster Squad (film)|Gangster Squad]]'' features the Los Angeles City Hall, with the members of the Gangster Squad stood in the foreground of the building, as well as it being used in the background of some scenes. [[Antonio Villaraigosa|Mayor Villaraigosa's]] conference room was also used for the office of Police Chief Parker.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7322">'''László Szombatfalvy''' (born 1927 in [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]]) is a businessman and author living in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Dagens Industri]], 2009-11-20&lt;/ref&gt; Szombatfalvy fled to Sweden in 1956 following the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian uprising]] of that year. He arrived with two empty hands and worked initially in a variety of jobs including as a magician in the refugee camps, before gradually becoming interested in the stock market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.aktiespararna.se/Artikelarkiv/Repotage/2011/november/Borsprofilen-Laszlo-Szombatfalvy--trollkarl-och-anonym-aktielegend/|title=Börsprofilen: László Szombatfalvy – trollkarl och anonym aktielegend|last=Bernhardsson|first=Jonas|newspaper=Aktiespararna|access-date=2016-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; His interest in [[stock]] led to his development of a method of risk calculation for investments for which he became well known on the Swedish stock market.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.affarsvarlden.se/hem/nyheter/article274372.ece Affärsvärlden]&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1980s his interests turned toward entirely different matters and he withdrew from the market. Over the past couple of years his attention has focused on the application of his risk assessment method to new fields.&lt;ref&gt;The website [http://thegreatestchallengesofourtime.com/ ''The Greatest Challenges of Our Time'']&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early career and stock market trader ==
Szombatfalvy began his stock trading career with 6,000 [[Swedish krona|Swedish Kronor]] (Crowns) in the mid-1960s.  In 1971 Szombatfalvy resigned from his then employment with the Finance Department at Swedish Shell to begin full-time trading in shares.  By the time he had celebrated his 60th birthday in 1987, Szombatfalvy’s wealth was estimated at 250 million Swedish Kronor, at which point he decided to stop active management of his stock.  In 2013, through successful placements of shares on the [[Stockholm Stock Exchange|Swedish Stock Exchange]], he had reportedly amassed a personal fortune of one billion Kronor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.va.se/nyheter/2015/01/05/laszlo-szombatfalvy-intervju/|title=Han flydde från kriget och blev miljardär - nu ska han rädda världen|newspaper=Veckans affärer|access-date=2016-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His private fortune was invested mainly in 10 million shares in the listed Swedish real-estate company, Castellum AB.

=== Stock trading philosophy ===
Szombatfalvy’s model for valuation and calculation of risk analysis of shares - with a record of 30 per cent returns per year for 46 years - was the foundation for his reputation as a successful trader on the Swedish stock market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.svd.se/en-borskrasch-kan-komma-nar-som-helst|title="En börskrasch kan komma när som helst"|last=Cervenka|first=Andreas|date=|work=|newspaper=SvD.se|access-date=2016-11-28|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Magnus Angenfelt, a former stock market analyst and co-founder of the hedge fund Manticore, ranked Szombatfalvy as the best investor in Sweden and the third best in the world in his book ''The World’s 99 Greatest Investors'' (Swedish - ''Världens 99 bästa investerare'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/World%C2%B4s-99-Greatest-Investors-Success-ebook/dp/B00LI5FGNW|title=The World´s 99 Greatest Investors: The Secret of Success|last=Angenfelt|first=Magnus|date=2014-07-27|publisher=Roos &amp; Tegnér AB|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Szombatfalvy’s philosophy in trading stock is to be a long-term investor, buying companies that are undervalued with low risk.  The qualitative model he used to valuate shares in a company didn’t have a formula, but built instead partly on a comprehensive analysis of the company itself, and partly on studying the stock market and interviewing people in the market.  His analysis of companies also included an in-depth study of the company, its branches and its management, which resulted in both an optimistic and pessimistic long-term prognosis of the company’s projected dividend growth.  The focus of Szombatfalvy’s study was on the dividend growth and the most important key was the company’s profits in its own capital, as this shows the company’s theoretical dividend and growth capacity.

== Author ==
In November 2009 Szombatfalvy made his debut as an author. In the book ''[[The Greatest Challenges of Our Time]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
  |last = Szombatfalvy
  |first = László
  |authorlink = László Szombatfalvy
  |title = The Greatest Challenges of Our Time
  |publisher = Ekerlids
  |year = 2010
  |isbn = 978-91-7092-157-5
}}&lt;/ref&gt; he briefly analyzes the severe threats facing humanity issuing from four mega-problems: [[Environmental degradation|environmental damage]], [[climate change]], [[Weapon of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]] and [[extreme poverty]]. He emphasizes the necessity for politicians to perform risk calculations in order to make the right decisions. The book was translated and released in English in September 2010. At the same time a second (revised) version was released in Swedish.

The following year, he released his second book, ''Känslor och förnuft'' (''Emotions and Mind: A book about moral decisions''), which discusses the concept of morality and how we should relate to our moral decisions in everyday life, work and in relationships with other people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.adlibris.com/se/bok/kanslor-och-fornuft-en-bok-om-moraliska-beslut-9789170921452|title=Känslor och Förnuft : En bok om moraliska beslut|website=Adlibris|access-date=2016-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Global Challenges Foundation ==
In March 2013, Szombatfalvy started the [[Global Challenges Foundation]] whose aim is to increase awareness of [[global catastrophic risk]]s and improve the world’s capacity to solve future crises.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pamlin.net/new/?p=1959|title=Global Challenges Foundation now official {{!}} Pamlin.net|website=www.pamlin.net|access-date=2016-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Szombatfalvy is currently the Chairman of the Global Challenges Foundation Board, which also includes the former Fourth National Pension Fund's CEO and sustainable investment advocate, Mats Andersson, and Climate Professor [[Johan Rockström]].

The foundation’s assets predominantly consist of a donation from Szombatfalvy, which will include roughly half of his fortune - around 500 million Swedish kronor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.svd.se/han-skanker-halv-miljard|title=Han skänker halv miljard|author=Andreas Cervenka |work=[[Svenska Dagbladet]]|language=Swedish|date=23 March 2013|access-date=1 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the foundation offered $5 million (USD) to winners of the [[Global Challenges Foundation Prize 2017]] − a contest asking for proposals for a new model capable of solving global problems.&lt;ref&gt;Chen, Angus.

'''Marcus Prinz von Anhalt''' (born '''Marcus Frank Adolf Eberhardt''';&lt;ref name="süddeutsche"&gt;{{cite news|title=Süddeutsche Zeitung: Zweiter Akt der Selbstinszenierung|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/bayern/prozess-um-marcus-von-anhalt-zweiter-akt-der-selbstinszenierung-1.2229605|newspaper=Sueddeutsche.de|date=2014-11-20|last1=Augsburg|first1=Korbinian Eisenberger}}&lt;/ref&gt; 20 December 1966) is a German businessman and nightclub owner, whose luxurious lifestyle results in some coverage in the German [[Yellow journalism|yellow press]].

==Early life and career==
Prinz von Anhalt was born Marcus Frank Adolf Eberhardt on 20 December 1966, in [[Pforzheim]], [[West Germany|Germany]], allegedly to a wealthy family. Prinz von Anhalt claims his parents owned a jewelry store, before their business was declared bankrupt and the family lost vast amounts of their wealth.&lt;ref name="princegermany.com/aboutme"&gt;princegermany.com/aboutme/&lt;/ref&gt; At age 13, Eberhardt held many jobs, and left school at 16 to become an apprentice butcher. He started a cleaning service, which was a subsidiary for the butcher business, and was receiving a combined income of 6000 Deutsche Mark at age 16. He completed another apprenticeship to become a chef, opening several restaurants and starting an interior design business.&lt;ref name="princegermany.com/aboutme"/&gt;

Eberhardt further diversified his organisation by opening several table-dance bars and gentlemen's clubs in the [[United States]]. He later bought several brothels, earning the nickname "red-light king." After this investment, Eberhardt was charged with money laundering, tax fraud and human trafficking.&lt;ref name="princegermany.com/aboutme"/&gt;

He is one of the largest and most visible owners of [[prostitution in Germany|brothels in Germany]], with over twenty brothels and night clubs. He has served four years in prison,&lt;ref name=spiegel&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/a-580861.html Pamelas Prinz], ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', 29 September 2008. {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; for human trafficking and tax evasion.&lt;ref name=sw&gt;[http://www.suedwest-aktiv.de/region/swp_neuulm/ulm_und_neu_ulm/3975954/artikel.php Der Bordellkönig besucht sein Reich], ''Südwest Presse'', 19 November 2008. {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claims to be a millionaire "in the three digit range," owning about 40 cars, real estate in Los Angeles (a mansion in [[Bel Air, Los Angeles|Bel Air]] he shares with [[Zsa Zsa Gabor]] and [[Frédéric Prinz von Anhalt]]), [[Fort Lauderdale]], [[Pforzheim]], [[St. Gallen]], [[Dubai]] and [[Monaco]], and to have 12 bodyguards and 25 servants.&lt;ref name="spiegel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sw"/&gt;

==Adoption and title==
In 2006, he bought his name for several million U.S. dollars by being adopted by [[Frédéric Prinz von Anhalt]], husband of [[Zsa Zsa Gabor]], who had himself obtained his name by adoption. The adoption and name change did not confer any actual title or nobility. "Prinz von Anhalt" is a surname (literally Prince of Anhalt), rather than a title, as per German laws abolishing [[German nobility|the country's former nobility]] in 1919. Furthermore, the [[Duchy of Anhalt|Anhalt family]] does not include Marcus Prinz von Anhalt as a member. He likes to refer to himself as "Prinz Germany." His brothers by adoption include Oliver Prinz von Anhalt, Michael Prinz von Anhalt and Markus Maximilian Prinz von Anhalt. His sister by adoption is [[Francesca Hilton]], who is the stepdaughter of his adoptive father and birth daughter of his adoptive mother. In 2008, he organized the "Royal Race," a tour of expensive cars and prominent drivers across Europe. [[Pamela Anderson]] was his partner at the race.&lt;ref name=spiegel/&gt; In February 2009 he was seen having lunch with her in Los Angeles. In 2009, when Zsa Zsa Gabor lost a substantial amount of money to [[Bernie Madoff]]'s [[Ponzi scheme]], he helped out with a cheque for $6 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.princegermany.com/press/press145.html Sein Adoptivsohn hilft ihm aus der Patsche] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090307040411/http://www.princegermany.com/press/press145.html |date=7 March 2009 }}, ''Freizeitwoche'', 18 February 2009. {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Imprisonment==
In November 2014 Marcus Prinz von Anhalt was sentenced to prison again. The judgment is not legally binding yet. While appealing the sentence, Prinz von Anhalt spent two years in detention.&lt;ref name=spiegel2&gt;{{cite news |last1=Diehl |first1=Jörg |title=Verdacht der Steuerhinterziehung: Der Prinz und sein Porsche-Problem |trans-title=Suspected of tax evasion: The prince and his Porsche problem |url=http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/justiz/steuerhinterziehung-prinz-marcus-von-anhalt-in-haft-a-966234.html |newspaper=Spiegel Online |accessdate=24 November 2018 |date=26 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nordbayern.de/ressorts/schlagzeilen/protz-prinz-marcus-von-anhalt-muss-vier-jahre-ins-gefangnis-1.4132886 |title=′Protz-Prinz′ Marcus von Anhalt muss vier Jahre ins Gefängnis |date=16 January 2015 |website=nordbayern.de |publisher=[[Nürnberger Nachrichten]] |language=de |accessdate=17 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prison sentence of 4 years was based on charges of tax evasion and fraud.&lt;ref name="süddeutsche"/&gt; The prosecution had accused Prinz von Anhalt of tax evasion of 1.5 million Euros.&lt;ref name="süddeutsche"/&gt; The prosecution had put forward an estimation of monetary damages for the tax authorities by Anhalt of Euro 747,000&lt;ref name="süddeutsche"/&gt; and another attempt to evade taxes of Euro 820,000.&lt;ref name="süddeutsche"/&gt; In particular, the prosecution accused von Anhalt that he declared the private usage of his 14&lt;ref name="süddeutsche"/&gt; luxury cars (all of a value of at least 1 Million Euros&lt;ref name="süddeutsche"/&gt;) and vacations in Las Vegas as professional and business expenditures towards the tax authorities.&lt;ref name="süddeutsche"/&gt; Von Anhalt argued that "his glamorous lifestyle" is part of his profession as a "TV star" and that therefore, he merely used his luxury cars for "representational" reasons, stating: "Driving in my [[Porsche]], [[Ferrari]] and [[Rolls-Royce Motors|Rolls-Royce]] and traveling to a show in [[Las Vegas]] occurred for professional reasons only."&lt;ref name="süddeutsche"/&gt; In addition, von Anhalt attempted to persuade the judge and the prosecution that if he did commit tax evasion, then it must have been unintentional as he did not fully understand the German tax laws at the time concerned, stating: "I know that the German tax laws are extremely complicated and maybe even the most complicated in the world. Some people may be able to understand the German tax laws but he is not one of them; but he knows how to successfully manage a brothel".&lt;ref name="süddeutsche"/&gt; The judges did not believe von Anhalt's explanations and consequently imposed a prison sentence of 4 years. Von Anhalt had declared previously that "he does not see a criminal offense in his case"&lt;ref name="süddeutsche"/&gt; and that the sums he supposedly evaded from tax authorities are "petty"&lt;ref name="süddeutsche"/&gt; and "ridiculous"&lt;ref name="süddeutsche"/&gt; given that "his brothels and disco clubs generate revenues in the two digit million range."&lt;ref name="süddeutsche"/&gt;

In prison it was discovered that von Anhalt had sent a letter to an acquaintance where he would insult the district attorney who had represented the prosecution in von Anhalts trial.&lt;ref name="Focus"&gt;{{cite web|title=Focus: 60,000 Euro Strafe - Von Anhalt beleidigt Staatsanwalt|url=http://www.focus.de/kultur/vermischtes/brief-aus-jva-abgefangen-60-000-euro-strafe-protz-prinz-beleidigt-staatsanwalt_id_4773236.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Von Anhalt had stated in the letter that "the district attorney is probably the dumbest district attorney in the world, that he has serious personal issues, that he squints and is poky and he merely is a cheap George Clooney wannabe."&lt;ref name="Focus"/&gt; Von Anhalt was consequently imposed a fine of 60,000 Euros.&lt;ref name="Focus"/&gt;

==Connections to Hells Angels==
Marcus Prinz von Anhalt reportedly has connections to the [[Hells Angels]] with whom von Anhalt engaged with in the past as business or security partners for his brothels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Augsburger Allgemeine: Der Protz-Prinz und der Höllenengel|url=http://www.augsburger-allgemeine.de/bayern/Der-Protz-Prinz-und-der-Hoellenengel-id32641947.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Prinz von Anhalt has a daughter, Zsana Prinzessin von Anhalt, named for her adoptive grandmother [[Zsa Zsa Gabor]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11693">The '''Mokken Scale''' is a [[Psychometrics|psychometric]] method of data reduction. A Mokken scale is a unidimensional scale that consists of hierarchically-ordered items that measure the same underlying, latent concept. This method is named after the political scientist [[Rob Mokken]] who suggested it in 1971.&lt;ref name=mokken1971theory&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mokken|first1=Rob|title=A theory and procedure of scale analysis: With applications in political research|date=1971|publisher=Walter de Gruyter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

Mokken scaling belongs to [[Item response theory]]. In essence, a Mokken scale is a non-parametric, probabilistic version of [[Guttman scale]]. Both Guttman and Mokken scaling can be used to assess whether a number of items measure the same underlying concept. Both Guttman and Mokken scaling are based on the assumption that the items are hierarchically ordered: this means that they are ordered by degree of "difficulty". Difficulty here means the percentage of respondents that answers the question affirmatively. The hierarchical order means that a respondent who answered a difficult question correctly is assumed to answer an easy question correctly.&lt;ref name="Crichton"&gt;Crichton, N. (1999) "Mokken Scale Analysis" ''Journal of Clinical Nursing 8, 388&lt;/ref&gt;
The key difference between a Guttman and Mokken scale is that Mokken scaling is probabilistic in nature. The assumption is not that ''every'' respondent who answered a difficult question affirmatively will ''necessarily'' answer an easy question affirmatively. Violations of this are called Guttman errors. Instead, the assumption is that respondents who answered a difficult question affirmatively are more ''likely'' to answer an easy question affirmatively. The scalability of the scale is measured by Loevinger's coefficient H. H compares the actual Guttman errors to the expected number of errors if the items would be unrelated.&lt;ref name="Crichton"/&gt;

The chance that a respondent will answer an item correctly is described by an item response function. Mokken scales are similar to [[Rasch model|Rasch scales]], in that they both adapted Guttman scales to a probabilistic model. However, Mokken scaling is described as 'non-parametric' because it makes no assumptions about the precise shape of the item response function, only that it is monotone and non-decreasing. The key difference between Mokken scales and Rasch scales is that the latter assumes that all items have the same item response function. In Mokken scaling the Item Response Functions differ for different items.&lt;ref name=vanschuur2003mokken/&gt;

Mokken scales can come in two forms: first as the Double Monotonicity model, where the items can differ in their difficulty. It is essentially, is an ordinal version of Rasch scale; and second, as the Monotone Homogeneity model, where items differ in their discrimination parameter, which means that there can be a weaker relationship between some items and the latent variable and other items and the latent variable.&lt;ref name=vanschuur2003mokken/&gt; Double Monotonicity models are used most often.

Double Monotonicity models are based on three assumptions.&lt;ref name=vanschuur2003mokken/&gt;
# There is a unidimensional latent trait on which subject and items can be ordered.
# The item response function is monotonically nondecreasing. This means that as one moves from one side of the latent variable to the other, the chance of giving a positive response should never decrease.
# The items are locally stochastically independent: this means that responses to any two items by the same respondent should not be the function any other aspect of the respondent or the item, but his or her position on the latent trait.&lt;ref name=vanschuur2003mokken/&gt;

The issue of sample size for Mokken scaling is largely unresolved. Work using simulated samples and varying the item quality in the scales (Loevinger's coefficient and the correlation between scales) suggests that, where the quality of the items is high that lower samples sizes in the region of 250-500 are required compared with sample sizes of 1250-1750 where the item quality is low.&lt;ref name="Straat"/&gt; Using real data from the Warwick Edinburgh Mental Well Being Scale (WEMWBS)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mentalhealthpromotion.net/resources/user-guide.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that the required sample size depends on the Mokken scaling parameters of interest as they do not all respond in the same way to varying sample size.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1080/21642850.2018.1505520|title = What are the minimal sample size requirements for Mokken scaling?

== Extensions ==

While Mokken scaling analysis was originally developed to measure the extent to which individual dichotomous items form a scale, it has since been extended for polytomous items.&lt;ref name=vanschuur2003mokken&gt;{{cite journal|last1=van Schuur|first1=Wijbrandt|title=Mokken scale analysis: Between the Guttman scale and parametric item response theory|journal=Political Analysis|date=2003|volume=11|issue=2|pages=139–163|url=http://pan.oxfordjournals.org/content/11/2/139.short|doi=10.1093/pan/mpg002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, while Mokken scaling analysis is a confirmatory method, meant to test whether a number of items form a coherent scale (like [[Confirmatory factor analysis]]), an Automatic Item Selection Procedure has been developed to explore which latent dimensions structure responses on a number of observable items (like [[Factor analysis]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = van der Ark | first1 = L.A. (Andries) | year = 2012 | title = New Developments in Mokken Scale Analysis in R | url = | journal = Journal of Statistical Software | volume = 48 | issue = 5 | doi=10.18637/jss.v048.i05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been some confusion in Mokken scaling between the concepts of Double Monotonicity model and invariant item ordering. The latter implies that all respondents to a series of questions all respond to them in the same order across the whole range of the latent trait. For dichotomously scored items, the Double Monotonicity model can mean invariant item ordering; however, for polytomously scored items this does not necessarily hold.&lt;ref name="Ligtvoet"&gt;Ligtvoet, R., van der Ark, L.A., te Marvelde J.M., and Sijtsma, K.

'''Non-binding arbitration''' is a type of [[arbitration]] in which the [[arbitrator]] makes a determination of the rights of the parties to the dispute, but this determination is not binding upon them, and no enforceable [[arbitration award]] is issued.  The "award" is in effect an advisory opinion of the arbitrator's view of the respective merits of the parties cases.  Non-binding arbitration is used in connection with attempts to reach a negotiated settlement.  The role of an arbitrator in non-binding arbitration is, on the surface, similar to that of a mediator in a [[mediation]].  However, the principal distinction is that whereas a mediator will try to help the parties find a middle ground to compromise at, the arbitrator remains totally removed from the settlement process and will only give a determination of liability and, if appropriate, an indication of the quantum of [[damages]] payable.

Subsequent to a non-binding arbitration, the parties remain free to pursue their claims either through the courts, or by way of a binding arbitration, although in practice a [[settlement (law)|settlement]] is the most common outcome.  The award and reasoning in a non-binding arbitration is almost invariably inadmissible in any subsequent action in the courts or in another arbitration tribunal.

Non-binding arbitration is utilised mostly in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].  It is largely unknown in Europe, although in the [[United Kingdom]] there is a practice of parties who are seeking a settlement to jointly instruct a [[Queen's Counsel]] for an opinion on the merits and likely quantum of a claim, and then to negotiate on the basis of the views expressed in that opinion.

==In fiction==

*In the [[Michael Crichton]] book, ''[[Disclosure (novel)|Disclosure]]'' (and in the [[Disclosure (film)|1994 film of the book]]), the sexual harassment claim relating to the lead character, Tom Sanders, is subject of a non-binding arbitration, which finds in his favour, but the other parties reject the determination.

After graduating from [[Moscow State University]] with a degree in physics, Deripaska became a metals broker specialized in trading aluminium before expanding into energy, machinery, financial services and agribusiness. In 2000, Deripaska founded Rusal, the result of a partnership between Sibirsky Aluminium and [[Roman Abramovich]]'s [[Millhouse Capital]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB106443818395367800|title=Aluminum Shake-Up May Loom in Russia|last=Whalen|first=Jeanne|date=25 September 2003|work=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=2 June 2017|language=en-US|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Rusal merged with SUAL Group and Glencore International AG to form UC Rusal, with Deripaska as chairman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/aluminium-russia-merger-idUSL2713534620070327|title=RUSAL, SUAL, Glencore complete aluminium merger|date=27 March 2007|agency=[[Reuters]]|accessdate=2 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was once [[List of Russian billionaires|Russia's richest man]], worth $28 billion, but lost a substantial part of his fortune amid the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|2007–08 financial crisis]]. As of August 2018, his wealth was estimated by ''[[Forbes]]'' at $3.3 billion.&lt;ref name="forbes" /&gt; 

Deripaska is also known for his connection to American political consultant [[Paul Manafort]], who has been convicted on charges of tax fraud, bank fraud and failure to report foreign bank accounts, which stemmed from [[Robert Mueller]]'s [[Special Counsel investigation (2017–present)|investigation]] into [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections]]. Deripaska employed Manafort from at least 2005 to 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stone|first1=Peter|title=Trump's new right-hand man has history of controversial clients and deals|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/27/paul-manafort-donald-trump-campaign-past-clients|accessdate=3 June 2017|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the founder of Volnoe Delo foundation, he is reported to have donated more than $250 million to mostly educational causes. He was married to Polina Yumasheva, step-granddaughter of former Russian President [[Boris Yeltsin]] and daughter of [[Valentin Yumashev]], Yeltsin's son-in-law and close advisor. According to some media reports, they were divorced in 2018.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.rambler.ru/other/40543183-zheny-izvestnyh-lyudey-zarabatyvayut-na-restoranah-i-galereyah/|title=Жёны известных людей зарабатывают на ресторанах и галереях|work=Рамблер/новости|access-date=15 August 2018|language=ru-RU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deripaska was also granted [[Cypriot citizenship]] in 2017.&lt;ref name="guardian02032018"/&gt;

==Education and early career==

===Early life===
Deripaska was born in [[Dzerzhinsk, Russia|Dzerzhinsk]], [[Nizhny Novgorod Oblast]], [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]] and grew up in [[Ust-Labinsk]], [[Krasnodar Krai]]. His parents were from [[Kuban]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Олигарх Дерипаска участвовал в приеме парада Кубанского казачьего войска|url=http://yasnonews.ru/news/politika/oligarkh_deripaska_uchastvoval_v_prieme_parada_kubanskogo_kazachego_voyska/|accessdate=25 May 2017|work=Yasno|date=22 April 2017|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deripaska grew up on the family's small farm, where from the age of 5 or 6, he learned how to live off the land from his grandparents,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title=Deripaska Rebound From Near-Crash Stares Down Potanin|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2011-02-21/deripaska-rebounding-from-near-disaster-stares-down-potanin-as-metals-soar|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|accessdate=13 January 2016|first=Stephanie|last=Baker}}&lt;/ref&gt; who primarily raised him after his widowed mother, an engineer, had to leave to find work.&lt;ref name="globeandmail2011"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Reguly|first1=Eric|title=At home with Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/careers/careers-leadership/at-home-with-russian-oligarch-oleg-deripaska/article573998/?page=all|accessdate=25 May 2017|work=The Globe and Mail|date=11 February 2011|language=en-ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deripaska credits his grandparents for teaching him the discipline of hard work along with farming.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Both his grandfathers fought in the [[Second World War]]; one was killed in battle and buried in a mass grave in [[Austria]], the other returned to Russia after the war ended.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|title=PROFILE: 'We're waiting for the aluminium industry to do its homework,' Deripaska says |url=http://www.metalbulletin.com/Article/3250360/Search/PROFILE-Were-waiting-for-the-aluminium-industry-to-do-its.html?PageId=196010&amp;Keywords=deripaska&amp;OrderType=1&amp;PageMove=2#axzz3sPgcUxAJ |publisher=metalbulletin.com |accessdate=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Deripaska's first job was at the Ust-Labinsk plant where his mother worked. At age 11, he became an electrician's apprentice doing maintenance on electrical motors.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Deripaska acquired a passion for reading; his favorite authors were [[Mayne Reid]] and [[Jack London]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Today, Basic Element's headquarters contain walls of books, reflecting Deripaska's lifelong love of reading.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; His talent for math allowed him to enroll at the physics faculty of Moscow State University in 1985.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; One year into his studies, he was conscripted into the armed forces and served in the Soviet army's Strategic Missile Forces&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; in the [[Transbaikal Military District|Trans-Baikal area]], Siberia, from 1986–1989.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Education ===
In 1993, Deripaska graduated with honors in physics from [[Moscow State University]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Basic Element – History|url=http://www.basel.ru/en/history/}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|collapse of the Soviet Union]] greatly eliminated academic funding and made it impossible for him to continue his studies as a [[Theoretical physics|theoretical physicist]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; There were no stipends or grants for students either. "We had no money. It was an urgent and practical question every day. How do I earn money to buy food and keep studying?" he recalls.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 1996, he earned a master's degree from the [[Plekhanov Russian University of Economics|Plekhanov University of Economics]].&lt;ref name="globeandmail2011"/&gt;

===Early career===
At the age of 25, teaming up with fellow physicists, engineers and rocket scientists, Deripaska set up his first metal trading company, VTK. He adopted a systematic, scientific approach to [[commodity trading]]. "I represented companies that were buying and selling raw materials", Deripaska said.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Deripaska undertook export arbitrage, buying metal at low Russian prices and selling it abroad at significantly higher international market prices. Deripaska traded primarily through the Baltic state of [[Estonia]] as the Russian system of export licenses was in disarray.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; "I started my business at an unusual moment in history. The country in which I was born raised had disappeared, although the new country was not fully formed. The first one gave me an excellent education; the second one gave me the chance of success", Deripaska recalled in an interview with ''[[Metal Bulletin]]''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

He used nearly all his arbitrage and trading profits to acquire his initial package of shares in the [[Sayanogorsk]] Aluminium Smelter in [[Southern Siberia]].&lt;ref name="FACTBOX: Who is Oleg Deripaska"&gt;{{Cite news|title=FACTBOX: Who is Oleg Deripaska?|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-deripaska-profile-idUSTRE51L1IH20090222|agency=[[Reuters]]|date=22 February 2009|accessdate=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1993 and 1994, Deripaska bought vouchers and shares in Sayanogorsk, and accumulated a 20% stake in the factory, becoming the biggest individual shareholder after the Russian State—to the annoyance of the plant's Communist-era bosses.

In 1994, Deripaska became director general of the plant at the age of 26.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1997, he founded Sibirsky (Siberian) Aluminium Group, which in 2000 merged with [[Roman Abramovich]]'s [[Millhouse Capital]] to create RUSAL.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=RUSAL battle set for British court|url=http://www.stabroeknews.com/2012/news/world/07/07/rusal-battle-set-for-british-court-2/|work=Stabroek News|date=7 July 2012|accessdate=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, businesses led by Deripaska increased their stake in those companies under common management to 75% by acquiring half of the interest managed by Millhouse Capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB955986247819859000|title=Russia's Aluminum Barons Form Cartel to Control 10% of Output|author=Jeanne Whalen|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=14 January 2016|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, the consolidation of RUSAL's ownership by companies related to Deripaska was completed with the acquisition of the remaining 25% equity interest in RUSAL managed by Millhouse Capital.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB106443818395367800|title=Aluminum Shake-Up May Loom in Russia|author=Jeanne Whalen|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=14 January 2016|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Business growth===

=== Metals and mining ===

====RUSAL====
[[Rusal|United Company RUSAL]] is the world's second largest aluminium company. It was the largest until it was overtaken by [[China Hongqiao Group]] in 2015. UC RUSAL accounts for almost 7% of the world's primary aluminium output and 7% of the world's alumina production. The company employs over 63 000 in 20 countries on five continents.

In order to ensure a stable supply of alumina to its smelters, several mergers and acquisitions were accomplished by RUSAL under Deripaska's guidance. At the beginning of the 2000s, RUSAL acquired bauxite mines in [[Guinea]], a country with the world's largest bauxite reserves. Subsequently, RUSAL acquired a stake in an alumina refinery in [[Australia]]. At Deripaska's behest, in 2007, RUSAL, [[SUAL Group]], one of the world's top 10 aluminum producers; and [[Glencore|Glencore International AG]], the Swiss natural resources group, merged their assets to form United Company RUSAL, the world's largest aluminum and alumina producer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-deripaska-profile-idUSTRE51L1IH20090222|title=FACTBOX: Who is Oleg Deripaska?|date=22 February 2009|accessdate=14 January 2016|agency=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the merger with [[Glencore]], bauxite and alumina assets in [[Jamaica]], Italy and Ireland were added to RUSAL's portfolio. These transactions converted RUSAL from a company with few supplies of the raw material bauxite into a vertically integrated corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Без партнеров|url=http://www.vedomosti.ru/newspaper/articles/2004/10/18/bez-partnerov|publisher=vedomosti.ru|accessdate=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In parallel, Deripaska invested significantly in the operational improvement of smelters inside Russia. He said, "We consolidated the industry, and located bauxites that do not exist in Russia. We established the company that became the leader of industry in less than twelve years. But to become the number one alumimium producer in the world, we had to improve our operations practice. To apply the best practices in the world, we looked at Toyota, which had utilized a precise, deep and well thought-through process for almost thirty years of operations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rusal.ru/upload/uf/573/PROSPECTUS.pdf|title=United Company RUSAL Limited|publisher=RUSAL|accessdate=3 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deripaska himself has been an active supporter Japanese production efficiencies made popular by the "[[The Toyota Way|Toyota Way]]." RUSAL smelters have adopted the concept of ''[[kaizen]]'', which means continuous improvement and involves training workers in standardized production techniques. "It's important to change both the company’s mind set and reporting lines," Deripaska said. "Instead of top-down management, you should understand everything is in the hands of your operator and empower that operator to drive efficiencies and improvements directly on the factory floor."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Under Deripaska's leadership, RUSAL constructed and commissioned Khakas aluminium smelter outside of Sayanogorsk in Russian Siberia. The Khakas facility was the first aluminium smelter built in post-Soviet Russia (since 1985). The smelter, with an annual capacity of 300,000 tonnes, is currently one of the most technologically advanced in the world&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/business/2006/oct/22/theobserver.observerbusiness9|title=Simon Caulkin: The world's most modern plant - and it's in Siberia|last=Caulkin|first=Simon|date=22 October 2006|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The company also undertook large-scale modernization projects at a number of its facilities, including the Bratsk, Krasnoyarsk and Irkutsk aluminium smelters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HKUST IAS - UC RUSAL President's Forum|url=http://ias.ust.hk/ucrusal/2010/transcript.html|publisher=ias.ust.hk|accessdate=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the middle of the financial crisis, Deripaska returned in 2009 to RUSAL as CEO to lead the company through the debt restructuring process. "I worked 16-hour days. We were in default, although none of the parties involved wanted to call it default." As part of contingency measures, Deripaska cut costs at RUSAL by 25% in 2009. By December 2009, Deripaska reached a final agreement with over 70 Russian and international lenders to refinance US$17 billion of debt.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2017, Rusal issued two [[Eurobond]]s to finance its debts. The first one, worth $600 million, was issued in February&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://aluminiuminsider.com/rusal-prices-initial-eurobond |title=Rusal Prices Initial Eurobond |date=30 January 2017|work=Aluminium Insider| accessdate =2 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, followed by the second one in April, worth $500 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= https://www.ft.com/content/1084218c-2cdc-355b-a52f-7887fb4aea59|title=Rusal profit amid rebound in aluminium prices|work =Financial Times |accessdate=2 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in February, plans were announced to sell 10 billion yuan worth of seven-year onshore bonds to finance purchases in China. This made Rusal the first foreign company to offer [[panda bonds]] on the [[Shanghai Stock Exchange]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2069488/aluminium-giant-rusal-plans-10-billion-yuan-panda-bond-issue|title=Rusal plans 10 billion yuan panda bond issue in Shanghai|work=South China Morning Post|date=9 February 2017|accessdate=2 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company also agreed on a pre-export finance mechanism with international lenders worth $1.7 billion for debt refinancing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://aluminiuminsider.com/rusal-negotiates-us1-7-bn-pxf-debt-facility |title=Rusal Negotiates US$1.7 BN PXF Debt Facility |date=26 May 2017|work=Aluminium Insider|accessdate=2 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Deripaska was awarded the "Aluminium Industry Ambassador Award" in the ''[[Metal Bulletin]]'' Awards for Excellence for his "great influence within the global aluminium industry and the wider market".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Winners of Metal Bulletin's awards for aluminium excellence 2013|url=http://www.metalbulletin.com/Article/3256866/Search/Winners-of-Metal-Bulletins-awards-for-aluminium-excellence.html|work=[[Metal Bulletin]]|accessdate=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deripaska stepped down from RUSAL in May 2018 the day after seven board members and the chief executive resigned. The move was part of an effort to get U.S. sanctions removed from the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sanctioned Tycoon Deripaska Resigns as Director of His Firm Rusal|url=https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/25/business/25reuters-usa-russia-sanctions-rusal.html|website=[[The New York Times]]|date=25 May 2018|access-date=27 May 2018|agency=Reuters|last1=Devitt|first1=Polina|last2=Voronova|first2=Tatiana|last3=Korsunskaya|first3=Darya|last4=Lowe|first4=Christian|editor-last=Anantharaman|editor-first=Muralikumar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, Deripaska established [[Volnoe Delo]], Russia's largest private charitable foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.europeanceo.com/profiles/oleg-deripaska-and-the-russian-aluminium-wars/|title=Oleg Deripaska and the Russian aluminium wars|access-date=25 May 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://volnoe-delo.ru/en/|title=Volnoe Delo Foundation|website=volnoe-delo.ru|language=ru|access-date=25 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.volnoe-delo.ru (20 April 2009): The Volnoe Delo Fund acknowledged as the largest contributor] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fund supports over 400{{cn|date=February 2018}} initiatives across Russia aimed at developing education and science, preserving spiritual and cultural heritage, and improving standards in public health.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.volnoe-delo.ru/ Volnoe Delo Fund website] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.heritagedaily.com/2016/08/darius-i-stele-found-in-ancient-town-of-phanagoria-in-russia/112378|title=Darius I stele found in ancient town of Phanagoria in Russia - HeritageDaily - Heritage &amp; Archaeology News|website=www.heritagedaily.com|language=en-US|access-date=25 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/billionaire-sochi-stray-dogs_n_4767912?guccounter=1|title=Billionaire Saves Sochi Stray Dogs!|date=11 February 2014|work=HuffPost UK|access-date=25 May 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; It helps children, old people, talented youths, teachers, eminent scientists and other participants of the programs.

Volnoe Delo has supported research activities in the 2,550-year-old city of [[Phanagoria]] since 2004. More than $10 million has been allocated to Phanagoria fieldwork over the past 14 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://popular-archaeology.com/article/darius-i-stele-found-in-ancient-town-of-phanagoria-in-russia/|title=Popular Archeology - Darius I stele found in ancient town of Phanagoria in Russia|work=Popular Archeology|access-date=25 May 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, Phanagoria is one of the best-equipped archeological expeditions in Russia and has its own scientific and cultural center, cutting edge equipment and technology for above-ground and underwater excavation as well as a large team of specialists involved in the excavation process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://popular-archaeology.com/issue/06052014/article/ancient-naval-ram-found-in-phanagoria-reveals-history-of-popular-unrest-in-63-b-c|title=Ancient naval ram found in Phanagoria reveals history of popular unrest in 63 B.C.|work=Popular Archeology|accessdate=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Volnoe Delo foundation launched a programme on students' early career guidance and professional training—JuniorSkills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://volnoe-delo.ru/en/events/news/junior-skills/|title=Junior Skills|website=volnoe-delo.ru|accessdate=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first, pilot, championship on professional skills, JuniorSkills Hi-Tech, was held in the Urals city of [[Yekaterinburg]] in 2014, part of the nationwide championship on cross-industry blue-collar professions in high-tech WorldSkills.

===Climate change ===

Deripaska is one of the 16 global business leaders who drafted CEO Climate Policy Recommendations to [[G8]] Leaders, a document outlining the international business community's proposals to tackle [[global warming]]. The proposals were signed by more than 100 of the world's leading corporations and handed to the [[Prime Minister of Japan]] [[Yasuo Fukuda]] on 20 June 2008. The G8 leaders discussed the recommendations during the summit in Japan on 7–9 July 2008. The process was coordinated by the [[World Economic Forum]] in collaboration with the [[World Business Council for Sustainable Development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weforum.org/en/initiatives/ghg/index.htm|title=World Economic Forum; Climate Change; CEO Climate Policy Recommendations to G8 Leaders|publisher=World Economic Forum|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101213183842/http://www.weforum.org/en/initiatives/ghg/index.htm|archivedate=13 December 2010|deadurl=yes|accessdate=14 May 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;br /&gt;[http://www.basel.ru/en/media/news/200807/news_07_07_2008/ Expert magazine; "Zero Waste"; interview] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deripaska actively advocates cutting the global carbon footprint and calls for the creation of an enforcement mechanism with consequences for countries that do not reduce carbon-intensive emissions, such as those produced by coal-fired powerplants.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/b72f19fe-7432-11e5-a129-3fcc4f641d98.html|title=Deripaska warns about competitive risks from Paris climate deal|last=Sanderson|first=Henry|date=18 October 2015|work=Financial Times|accessdate=13 January 2016|last2=Clark|first2=Pilita|issn=0307-1766}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also remains a strong advocate of a legally binding climate change deal, but has publicly voiced concern about the potential competitive impact of a [[Paris climate agreement]] and also about the absence of binding measures to curb each country's emissions in the near future.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; "Everyone is in favour; we just need to have more or less fair regulation. There shouldn't be any pockets where people can cheat the system. People shouldn't agree on something that creates another Kyoto protocol that creates nice polished statements", he told the ''Financial Times'' in January 2016.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

===Other activities===

In February 2014, Deripaska financed the construction of makeshift kennels to house stray dogs that had been abandoned by construction workers after completing work on the [[Sochi Olympic Stadium|Sochi Olympic Village]]. Officials said the number of strays exceeded 2,000 and the animals presented a risk of [[rabies]], so they contracted out their extermination. Many of these dogs were saved and more were re-homed in a global adoption program that Deripaska created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/sochi-olympic-parks-condemned-stray-dogs-saved-by-russian-billionaire-9118727.html|title=Sochi Olympic Park's condemned stray dogs 'saved by Russian billionaire'|last=Withnall|first=Adam|date=10 February 2014|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=10 February 2014|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6NIpi8tqF?url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/sochi-olympic-parks-condemned-stray-dogs-saved-by-russian-billionaire-9118727.html|archivedate=11 February 2014|deadurl=yes|location=London|df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assisted FBI with Rescue of Levinson== 
Between mid-2008 and 2009, Deripaska helped the then-FBI Director [[Robert Mueller]] rescue a former FBI-agent [[Robert Levinson]], who disappeared in 2007 while working for the CIA in Iran. The then-FBI deputy director [[Andrew McCabe]] played key role in courting Deripaska. Agents secretly met Deripaska in hotels in Paris, Vienna, Budapest, Hungary, and Washington, convincing him to spend millions of his own dollars funding the FBI-supervised operation to Levinson. His participation was crucial, as he had close business ties in Iran, and because of economic sanctions imposed on Iran and other laws made it illegal for the FBI or any US citizen to spend any money in Iran. Deripaska's lawyer said he spent $25 million on a private search-and-rescue team that worked with Iranian contacts while monitored by the FBI.

Deripaska managed to arrange the release of Levinson, but the U.S. State Department, then under [[Hillary Clinton]], blocked a deal for Levinson's return from going through. Robyn Gritz, the retired agent who supervised the Levinson case in 2009, said: "We tried to turn over every stone we could to rescue Bob, but every time we started to get close, the State Department seemed to always get in the way". “We were told at one point that the terms of Levinson’s release had been agreed to by Iran and the U.S. and included a statement by then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton pointing a finger away from Iran. At the last minute, Secretary Clinton decided not to make the agreed-on statement.”

The operation was ended in 2011, because FBI officials were concerned that Deripaska's Iranian contacts couldn't deliver with all the U.S. infighting. The FBI rewarded Deripaska for his help.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/387625-mueller-may-have-a-conflict-and-it-leads-directly-to-a-russian-oligarch |title=Mueller may have a conflict — and it leads directly to a Russian oligarch |publisher=''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]'' |first=John |last=Solomon |date=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/14/world/middleeast/a-disappearing-american-spy-and-the-cia.html |title=A Disappearing Spy, and a Scandal at the C.I.A. |publisher=''The New York Times'' |first=Barry |last=Meier |date=13 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== FBI recruitment attempt ==
According to anonymous sources cited by the 1 September 2018 [[New York Times]]′s report, Deripaska was twice approached by the U.S. government officials, including [[Bruce Ohr]], as part of the U.S. government wider FBI–led recruitment effort to obtain informers in the circle close to [[Vladimir Putin]]: in September 2015 and in September 2016.&lt;ref name="nytflipoligarchs"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Vogel |first1=Kenneth P. |last2=Rosenberg |first2=Matthew |title=Agents Tried to Flip Russian Oligarchs.

In September 2015, Ohr and Steele met with Deripaska to discuss "connections between Russian organized crime and Mr. Putin’s government, as well as other issues, according to a person familiar with the events." Deripaska laughed them off and did not agree to a second meeting.&lt;ref name="nytflipoligarchs" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.zeit.de/news/2018-09/02/bericht-us-ermittler-wollten-oligarchen-deripaska-als-informanten-gewinnen-20180902-doc-18s9cd |title=Bericht: US-Ermittler wollten Oligarchen Deripaska als Informanten gewinnen |publisher=''[[Die Zeit]]'' |date=2 September 2018 |lang=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/report-us-investigators-probing-trump-sought-to-cultivate-russian-oligarchs/ |title=Report: US investigators probing Trump sought to cultivate Russian oligarchs |publisher=''[[The Times of Israel]]'' |date=3 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, F.B.I. agents showed up unannounced at Deripaska's door in New York in September 2016.&lt;ref name="nytflipoligarchs" /&gt;

The attempts to turn Deripaska into an informant undertaken between 2014 and 2016 were unsuccessful, Deripaska notified the Russian authorities of the US efforts to recruit him.&lt;ref name="nytflipoligarchs" /&gt;

In September 2018, Russia's government accused the US of meddling in the country's affairs by attempting to recruit Russian citizens as agents for American security services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.ft.com/content/57cbf8e4-af6f-11e8-8d14-6f049d06439c |title=Russia says US spy agencies attempting to interfere in its affairs |publisher=''Financial Times'' {{subscription required}} |first=Henry |last=Foy |date=3 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
===Cherney lawsuit===
[[Michael Cherney]] brought legal action against Deripaska in the [[Commercial Court (England and Wales)|Commercial Court]] of the [[High Court]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/the-worlds-richest-russian-is-sued-for-3bn-in-london-437814.html|title=The world's richest Russian is sued for $3bn in London|work=The Independent|location=UK|date=25 February 2007|accessdate=14 May 2011|first=Andrew|last=Osborn}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cherney sought a declaration that he was the beneficial owner of 20% of [[RUSAL]] stock which, he claimed, Deripaska held in trust for him. The claim was denied. On 3 May 2007, Justice Langley ruled that Deripaska had not been properly [[service of process|served]], and that the court had no [[jurisdiction]] to try the claim as Deripaska did not live in England or Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Comm/2007/965.html|title=''Cherney v Deripaska'', 2007 EWHC 965 (Comm)|publisher=Bailii.org|accessdate=14 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 July 2008, Justice Christopher Clarke ruled that the case should be tried in England, although "the natural forum for this litigation is Russia", because, he held, "risks inherent in a trial in Russia...are sufficient to make England the forum in which the case can most suitably be tried in the interest of both parties and the ends of justice".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Comm/2008/1530.html|title=''Cherney v Deripaska'', 2008 EWHC 1530 (Comm)|publisher=Bailii.org|accessdate=14 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 July 2008, he granted Deripaska leave to appeal. The Court of Appeal of England and Wales refused the appeal on 31 July 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2009/849.html|title=Deripaska v Cherney, 2009 EWCA Civ 849|publisher=Bailii.org|accessdate=14 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- is refused the right word? Can't think of a better one right now --&gt;

At a June 2011 case management conference, the judge deferred a decision on whether Cherney would be allowed to give evidence by video link from Israel rather than appear in person. An outstanding arrest warrant issued by [[Interpol]] meant that the British would detain him if he travelled to the UK.&lt;ref&gt;Paul, Jonny.

[[Interpol]], (14 October 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; In late July 2011, the High Court ruled to allow Cherney to give evidence at the trial by video link from Israel, and also set trial for April 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url =http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23973334-the-gangster-a-billionaire-friend-of-mandelson-and-a-pound-23bn-row.do |title=The 'gangster', a billionaire friend of Mandelson and a £2.3bn row|work=Evening Standard|first=Paul|last=Cheston|date=28 July 2011|accessdate=8 August 2011| deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222031121/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23973334-the-gangster-a-billionaire-friend-of-mandelson-and-a-pound-23bn-row.do|archivedate=22 February 2012|df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deripaska denied that Cherney was owed any stake in RUSAL, and asserted payments made to Cherney had been for unavoidable "protection" at a time when violence was sweeping the region and posed an existential threat to any profitable business in the country. In an interview with ''The Telegraph'', Deripaska said he was one of the few who worked to clean up Russian industry and provided support to law enforcement agencies. However, in this early chaotic period paying protection money to criminal gangs was inescapable, as revealed in court testimony.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Oleg Deripaska: Why I paid crime gangs for protection| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/industry/mining/9218657/Oleg-Deripaska-Why-I-paid-crime-gangs-for-protection.html|work=The Telegraph |accessdate=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2012, Cherney terminated his UK lawsuit against Deripaska.&lt;ref name="Suit Against Russian Billionaire Is Dropped, WSJ"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390444549204578022433469797910 |title=Suit Against Russian Billionaire Is Dropped|work=The Wall Street Journal|first1=Paul|last1=Sonne|first2=Alexander|last2=Kolyandr|date=27 September 2012|accessdate=7 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== U.S. investigation===
In 2015, Deripaska filed a lawsuit against [[Morgan Stanley]], accusing the bank of using [[insider information]] to [[short (finance)|short sell]] the businessman's $1.5 billion investment in shares of Magma in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Morgan Stanley to face Russian tycoon's insider trading claims |url= http://in.reuters.com/article/morgan-stanley-trial-idINL1N12S3RO20151101|website=Reuters India|accessdate=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Deripaska's Veleron [[investment vehicle]] acquired stock in Canadian based [[Magna International]] through a $1.2 billion loan from [[BNP Paribas]], with Magna shares serving as [[collateral (finance)|collateral]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Russian tycoon Oleg Deripaska sues Morgan Stanley|url=https://www.rt.com/business/320611-deripaska-rusal-bank-court/|website=RT International|accessdate=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morgan Stanley was involved in the deal through a swap agreement with BNP Paribas where the US bank assumed the risks of the loan in return for a fixed payment from Paribas.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Morgan Stanley Defeats Russian Tycoon’s Short-Selling Claims|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-13/morgan-stanley-defeats-russian-tycoon-s-short-selling-claims-igy8py53|website=Bloomberg.com|accessdate=13 January 2016|first=Bob|last=Van Voris|first2=Erik|last2=Larson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2008, Magna's stocks plummeted, hit by the global economic downturn. BNP issued a $93 million [[margin call]] to Veleron. Morgan Stanley, in turn, learned that Veleron was unlikely to meet the call and sold the stock short.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite news|title=UPDATE 1-Morgan Stanley cleared in Russian tycoon's insider trading lawsuit|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/morgan-stanley-trial-idUSL1N1382UF20151113|newspaper=Reuters|date=13 November 2015|accessdate=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deripaska claimed that Morgan Stanley abused its duties and engaged in unlawful [[insider trading]] that resulted in significant financial damage to Veleron, estimated at $15 million to $25 million.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; A New York jury determined in November 2015 that Morgan Stanley had "acquired inside information and traded on it despite a duty to keep it confidential and not trade on it," finding as well that Morgan Stanley did not have the intent to [[defraud]] Veleron. Veleron strongly disagreed with and said it would file an appeal.&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt;{{when|date=June 2016}}

In July 2006, whilst Deripaska was involved in a bid to buy the [[Daimler Chrysler]] Group, it was reported that the United States canceled his entry visa; the unnamed official declined to give a reason for the revoking of the visa. The ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' reported that it could have been because Deripaska has been accused of having links to organized crime in Russia and cited as their sources two unnamed U.S. law enforcement officials.&lt;ref name="reuters.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN1143738620070511|title=U.S. revoked Deripaska visa – State Dep't official|first=Jim|last=Wolf|date=11 May 2007|agency=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The New York Times'' reported on 27 August 2018 that the visa had been revoked on concerns Deripaska might attempt to launder money through real estate transactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/27/us/politics/bruce-ohr-trump-justice-department.html|title=Bruce Ohr Fought Russian Organized Crime. Now He’s a Target of Trump.|publisher=|accessdate=29 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deripaska had received a multiple-entry visa in 2005; a U.S. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] spokesman refused to comment. Lobbying on his behalf had been done by former Senate Republican leader and 1996 presidential candidate [[Bob Dole]] and his Alston &amp; Bird law partners, Senate records show. Alston &amp; Bird was paid about US$260,000 in 2005 for work on "Department of State visa policies and procedures" tied to Deripaska.&lt;ref name="reuters.com"/&gt;

In 2009, Deripaska was again allowed entry and visited the United States twice. ''The Wall Street Journal'' reported that according to two unnamed FBI administration officials, Deripaska had met with agents regarding a continuing criminal probe, the details of the probe were not known or reported. During Deripaska's visits, he met with leading management figures from investment banks [[Goldman Sachs]] and [[Morgan Stanley]]. The Aluminum company that Deripaska heads, [[United Company RUSAL]], was in preparations for an initial public offering. The easing of Deripaska's visa issues which were an issue for possible investors helped to reassure bankers. The State Department has never said why it revoked his visa and refused to comment on his 2009 visits. The visits were arranged outside of the usual process as the U.S. continues to have concerns about Deripaska's business associations. Deripaska has repeatedly denied a connection to any organized crime and said business rivals have caused the visa to be revoked by smearing him. When interviewed by the BBC in July 2009, Deripaska said that the authorities in the United States had been attempting to blackmail him by revoking his visa and thus affecting possible investors in a negative way and thereby hoping to push Deripaska into cooperating with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB125687000832717809 | work=The Wall Street Journal | title=Deripaska Accused U.S. of Blackmail | date=30 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spanish investigation===

According to an article in ''[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]'', Deripaska and [[Iskander Makhmudov]] (head of UGMK) were asked by Spanish police to answer questions in relation to a money-laundering enquiry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/papel/2010/03/21/mercados/23228430.html |title=Quiosco, El Mundo en ORBYT |work=El Mundo|location=Spain |accessdate=14 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish state prosecutor's office subsequently confirmed Deripaska's interrogation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1282571/Oligarch-friend-Peter-Mandelson-faces-cash-launder-quiz.html?ito=feeds-newsxml |work=Daily Mail | title=Oligarch friend of Mandelson faces cash launder quiz | date=30 May 2010 | location=London | first=Jason | last=Lewis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Deripaska has been interrogated previously as a witness in Spain and England and by the FBI in cases of [[money laundering]], he has never been charged with any crimes in those probes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB125685578903317087 | work=The Wall Street Journal | title=FBI Lets Barred Tycoon Visit U.S | first1=Evan | last1=Perez | first2=Gregory L. | last2=White | date=30 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 January 2010, the ''[[Financial Times]]'' published a story "Rusal: A lingering heat" exploring Deripaska's business relations with Sergei Popov and Anton Malevsky, alleged heads of Russian organized crime groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/70a1c458-09ff-11df-8b23-00144feabdc0.html?nclick_check=1 |title=/ Comment / Analysis – Rusal: A lingering heat |work=Financial Times |date=25 January 2010 |accessdate=14 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deripaska has accused Michael Chernoy of using Malevsky and the [[Izmaylovskaya gang|Izmailovskaya syndicate]] to extort US$250&amp;nbsp;million from him as part of a protection racket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/clash-of-the-oligarchs-1753022.html|title=Clash of the oligarchs|work=The Independent|location=UK|date=20 July 2009|accessdate=14 May 2011|first=Donald|last=MacIntyre}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Deripaska has himself been accused of having similar links to Malevsky, who, with his brother Andrei, owned a 10% stake in Deripaska's company. Deripaska denies the claims.&lt;ref&gt;Swinford, Steven, "Peter Mandelson oligarch Oleg Deripaska linked to mafia boss", ''The Sunday Times'' (London), 26 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, Spain's High Court sent the criminal cases against Deripaska to the Russian General Prosecutor's office because the root of the cases is Russian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://en.gazeta.ru/news/2011/11/25/a_3848274.shtml|title=Russian Tycoon Deripaska's case given to Russia's court by Spain|publisher=gazeta.ru|first=Darya|last=Ispolnova|date=25 November 2011|accessdate=28 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political relationships===
[[File:Vladimir Putin 19 March 2002-4.jpg|thumb|[[Vladimir Putin]] and Deripaska, 19 March 2002]]
====Vladimir Putin====
Deripaska is noted for his close ties with Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]]. Their relationship was visibly strained amidst Deripaska's financial struggles in 2009, but in a widely broadcast incident on Russian television, Putin visited a stalled cement factory owned by Deripaska and berated its management. He forced Deripaska to sign a contract promising to pay nearly $1 million in unpaid wages.&lt;ref name="globeandmail2011"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Oliphant|first1=Roland|title=Fifteen years of Vladimir Putin: in quotes|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/vladimir-putin/11588182/Fifteen-years-of-Vladimir-Putin-in-quotes.html|accessdate=25 May 2017|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=7 May 2015|language=en}}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite news|last1=Reynolds|first1=Leda|title=ISIS beware: THIS is how hardman Russian President Vladimir Putin gets things DONE|url= http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/610552/ISIS-beware-THIS-is-how-hardman-Vladimir-Putin-gets-things-DONE|accessdate=25 May 2017|work=The Express| date=7 October 2015|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their relationship recovered, however, and Deripaska has been described as "Putin's favorite [[Business magnate|industrialist]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Marcin|first1=Tim|title=Meet Oleg Deripaska, who allegedly worked with former Trump aide Paul Manafort to push Putin's views| url=http://www.newsweek.com/who-oleg-deripaska-paul-manafort-russian-putin-572157|accessdate=25 May 2017|work=Newsweek|date=22 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[United States diplomatic cables leak|Leaked U.S. diplomatic cables]] from 2006 described Deripaska as "among the 2-3 oligarchs Putin turns to on a regular basis" and "a more-or-less permanent fixture on Putin's trips abroad".&lt;ref name="ap32217"&gt;{{cite news|last1= Horowitz| first1=Jeff|last2=Day|first2=Chad|title=AP findings on Trump associate's work for Russian oligarch|url=https://apnews.com/ba0027b4c29a4863b096d7216ee0ca58/ap-findings-trump-associates-work-russian-oligarch|accessdate=25 May 2017|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=22 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', Tye Burt, who knows Deripaska and is the CEO of [[Kinross Gold]] said that, "I believe Russia recognizes Oleg's major role in building a renewed economic base in a broad range of domestic businesses and rejuvenating ailing companies and infrastructure."&lt;ref name="globeandmail2011"/&gt;

====Nathaniel Rothschild and Peter Mandelson====
Deripaska is a friend of [[Nathaniel Philip Rothschild|Nathaniel Rothschild]], a major investor in both [[Glencore]] and [[United Company RUSAL]]. Together Deripaska and Rothschild hosted [[George Osborne]] and [[Peter Mandelson]] on Deripaska's yacht in [[Corfu]] in the summer of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;

====Paul Manafort====
On 22 March 2017, the [[Associated Press]] published a report alleging that&amp;nbsp;[[Paul Manafort]], [[Donald Trump]]'s former presidential campaign manager, negotiated a $10 million annual contract with Deripaska to promote Russian interests in politics, business, and media coverage in Europe and the United States, starting in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.apnews.com/122ae0b5848345faa88108a03de40c5a/Manafort's-plan-to-'greatly-benefit-the-Putin-Government|title=Trump campaign chief linked to Putin interests|last=HORWITZ and DAY|first=|date=22 March 2017|work=Associated Press|accessdate=22 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170402165112/https://www.apnews.com/122ae0b5848345faa88108a03de40c5a/Manafort's-plan-to-'greatly-benefit-the-Putin-Government|archive-date=2 April 2017|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Deripaska and Manafort have confirmed to have worked together in the past,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/know-paul-manafort-links-oleg-224806634.html|title=What We Know About Paul Manafort's Links to Oleg Deripaska and the Kremlin|accessdate=5 April 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; but rejected the contents of the AP story.

Responding to the allegations, on 28 March 2017, Deripaska published open letters in the print editions of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', in which he denied having signed a $10 million contract with Manafort in order to benefit the [[Russia under Vladimir Putin|Putin government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/russian-manafort-client-willing-to-speak-to-congress/2017/03/28/1add6c1a-13e9-11e7-bb16-269934184168_story.html|title=Russian Manafort client: Willing to speak to Congress|website=Washington Post| accessdate=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also stated his willingness to testify before the [[United States Congress]] to dispel these allegations,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/russian-manafort-client-willing-to-speak-to-congress/2017/03/28/1add6c1a-13e9-11e7-bb16-269934184168_story.html|title=Russian Manafort client: Willing to speak to Congress|website=Washington Post|accessdate=5 April 2017}}&lt;br/&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/russian-billionaire-oleg-deripaska-paul-manafort-ties-donald-trump-campaign-manager-us-congress-a7655291.html|title=Russian billionaire with ties to Trump’s ex-campaign manager says he is willing to testify before Congress|date=29 March 2017|work= The Independent|accessdate=5 April 2017|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; and argued that the accusations fall "into the negative context of current US-Russian relations."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/russian-billionaire-oleg-deripaska-paul-manafort-ties-donald-trump-campaign-manager-us-congress-a7655291.html|title=Russian billionaire with ties to Trump's ex-campaign manager says he is willing to testify before Congress|date=29 March 2017|work=The Independent|accessdate=4 April 2017|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Congressional sources cited by ''[[The New York Times]]'', lawmakers declined Deripaska's request, after it emerged that he had asked for immunity.

==== Navalny video ====
In February 2018, [[Alexei Navalny]] published a video about a meeting between Deripaska and Deputy Prime Minister of Russia [[Sergei Eduardovich Prikhodko]] on a yacht traveling near Norway. According to Navalny, Deripaska probably served as a middle man between the Russian government represented by Prikhodko and Paul Manafort during [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections]].&lt;ref name="Rybka"/&gt; Prikhodko denied the allegations, accusing Navalny of "mixing the facts" about his "friend" Deripaska, [[Donald Trump]] and [[Paul Manafort]], while also voicing his wish to have talk with Navalny as a "man with a man".&lt;ref name=":52"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rbc.ru/politics/09/02/2018/5a7dc6479a7947a4be81bebb|title=Вице-премьер Приходько заявил о желании ответить Навальному по-мужски|publisher=РБК|accessdate=10 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|accessdate=10 February 2018|language=ru-RU|work=Meduza|title=Роскомнадзор потребовал от «Медиазоны» и «Радио Свобода» удалить фотографии из новости про Дерипаску, Приходько и Рыбку|url=https://meduza.io/news/2018/02/09/roskomnadzor-potreboval-ot-mediazony-udalit-fotografii-iz-novosti-pro-deripasku-prihodko-i-rybku}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|accessdate=10 February 2018|title=Вице-премьер Приходько хочет ответить Навальному по-мужски|url=https://ura.news/news/1052323171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A day after the video was published the [[Roskomnadzor]] added the video to the [[Federal List of Extremist Materials]], thus making accessing the video illegal for all Russian citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|accessdate=10 February 2018|date=10 February 2018|language=ru-RU|work=Interfax.ru|title=Суд включил в реестр запрещенной информации фильм ФБК о Дерипаске и Приходько|url=http://www.interfax.ru/russia/599352}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also ordered [[YouTube]] to remove seven videos and [[Instagram]] to take down 14 points that were cited in the investigation; neither YouTube nor Instagram had responded as of 12 February 2018. According to a Roskomnadzor representative who spoke to ''[[Vedomosti]]'', a "court injunction of this sort against content hosted on Instagram and YouTube is unprecedented for Russia". The ''New York Times'' noted that this may presage a "more aggressive approach by the Russian government" to control online activities.&lt;ref name="lux"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Luxmoore|first1=Matthew|title=Russia Threatens to Block YouTube and Instagram, After Complaints From an Oligarch|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/12/world/europe/russia-youtube-instagram-navalny.html|accessdate=13 February 2018| work= New York Times|date=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The New York Times'' reported on 5 March 2018, that [[:uk:Настя Рибка|Anastasia Vashukevich]], a Belarusian national currently incarcerated in [[Bangkok]], claims to have over 16 hours of audio recordings she says could shed light on possible Russian interference in American elections. She is offering the recordings to American authorities in exchange for asylum, to avoid extradition to Belarus. Vashukevich claims to be close to Deripaska and asserts the recordings include him discussing the 2016 presidential election with associates Vashukevich did not name. "Deripaska had a plan about elections," ''The New York Times'' quoted Vashukevich as saying. She stated that some of the recorded conversations, which she asserts were made in August 2016, included three individuals who spoke fluent English and whom she believed were Americans. ''The New York Times'' reported that her claims might be easily dismissed were it not for the Navalny video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/05/world/asia/nastya-rybka-trump-putin.html|title=Escort Says Audio Recordings Show Russian Meddling in U.S. Election|first=Richard C.|last=Paddock|date=5 March 2018|publisher=|accessdate=5 March 2018|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deripaska was married to Polina Yumasheva, the daughter of [[Boris Yeltsin]]'s top adviser [[Valentin Yumashev]] and stepdaughter of Yeltsin's daughter [[Tatyana Yumasheva|Tatyana]].

In March 2018, it was reported that Deripaska had successfully purchased [[Cypriot citizenship]] in 2017 under Cyprus' "golden visa" that generates billions of revenue for the island nation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5335">'''One Tambon One Product''' ('''OTOP''') is a local [[entrepreneurship]] stimulus program designed by [[Thailand]]'s former Prime Minister [[Thaksin Shinawatra]] during his 2001-2006 [[Thai Rak Thai]] government. The program aimed to support locally made and marketed products of each of Thailand's 7,255 [[tambon]]s (sub-district). Drawing its inspiration from [[Japan]]'s successful [[One Village One Product movement|One Village One Product]] (OVOP) program,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is OTOP?|url=https://www.thaiembassy.sg/friends-of-thailand/p/what-is-otop|website=Royal Thai Embassy Singapore|accessdate=15 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thaitrakulpanich|first1=Asaree|title=DESIGNERS TAKE OTOP PRODUCTS FROM NOPE TO DOPE|url=http://www.khaosodenglish.com/featured/2017/08/14/designers-remake-otop-products-nope-dope/|accessdate=15 August 2017|work=Khaosod English|date=2017-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; the OTOP program encourages village communities to improve the quality and marketing of local products, selecting one superior product from each tambon to receive formal branding as its "starred OTOP product". It provides both a local and national stage to the promote these products. OTOP includes a large array of local products, including traditional handicrafts, cotton and silk garments, pottery, fashion accessories, household items, and foods. After a [[CDRM|military junta]] overthrew Thaksin's government in 2006 following an election cancelled for irregularities, the OTOP program was cancelled. However, it was soon revived and rebranded.

The One Tambon One Product movement is a self-help effort wherein rural communities participate in the creation of a product that can be sold locally and internationally.&lt;ref name="Kasem Bundit"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Khongsawatkiat|first1=Kittiphun|title=Isan Studies: 'One Tambon, One Product'; A Government Policy Recovers Farmers' Debts and Fragile Rural Sector in Northeastern of Thailand|journal=Kasem Bundit|date=Jul–Dec 2002|volume=3|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management and organization==
OTOP is managed by the Community Development Department (CDD) of Thailand's [[Ministry of Interior (Thailand)|Interior Ministry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://www.cdd.go.th/en/related-links/%E0%B8%9A%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B4%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%A0%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%A2%E0%B9%83%E0%B8%99-en/about-us|website=Community Development Department (CDD)|publisher=Ministry of Interior|accessdate=15 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are 36,000 OTOP groups in Thailand, each having between 30 to 3,000 members. Sakda Siridechakul, president of [[Chiang Mai Province|Chiang Mai]]'s OTOP association noted, "OTOP has helped spread income to many people in the villages. It has allowed people producing [[handicrafts]] to feel they are part of the global economy."{{CN|date=August 2017}}

==Financials==
In 2017 OTOP product sales were 153 billion [[Thai baht|baht]]. The government aims for sales of 200-300 billion baht every year.&lt;ref name=BP-20180515&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wancharoen|first1=Supoj|title=Villages go all out to charm tourists|url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/1465542/villages-go-all-out-to-charm-tourists|accessdate=15 May 2018|work=Bangkok Post|date=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government allocated 8.3 billion baht budget to the CDD to stimulate community tourism in 3,273 villages across the country between April–September 2018. Among the program's aims are to develop at least 64,570 new OTOP items with an average annual sales growth of at least 10 percent.&lt;ref name=BP-20180515/&gt;

==After the 2006 coup==
The [[CDRM|military junta]] that [[2006 Thailand coup|overthrew]] the Thai Rak Thai government on 19 September 2006 changed the program's name to ''Local and Community Products'', but OTOP branding was kept.{{CN|date=August 2017}}

==OTOP Product Champion==
One of the mechanisms to promote and support the development of Thai OTOP products is the "Product Champion" (OPC). Besides setting up OTOP communities and small to medium enterprises (SME), a seminar called "Smart OTOP" has now provided more than 26,600 participants advice in improving their skills and knowledge in order to develop better products. The number of participants increases each year.{{CN|date=August 2017}}

A rating system for OTOP products is followed, the highest being five stars. At last count, there were 569 five-star products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OTOP 5 Star Products|url=http://www.otop5star.com/index-en.php|website=OTOP5Star|publisher=Community Development Department|accessdate=15 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is an annual exhibition of products called "OTOP Mid-year". OTOP Mid-year-2010 ended with consolidated turnover of 810 million [[Thai baht|baht]].&lt;ref&gt;http://thainews.prd.go.th/en/news.php?id=255308300044&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=August 2017}}

'''Philip Bayard "Phil" Crosby''', (June 18, 1926 – August 18, 2001) was a businessman and author who contributed to management theory and quality management practices.&lt;ref&gt;

Crosby initiated the [[Zero Defects]] program at the [[Glenn L. Martin Company|Martin Company]].&lt;ref name="Harwood"/&gt;  As the quality control manager of the [[Pershing missile]] program, Crosby was credited with a 25 percent reduction in the overall rejection rate and a 30 percent reduction in scrap costs.

==Early life and career==
Crosby was born in Wheeling, West Virginia, in 1926.  He served in the Navy during World War II and again during the Korean War.  In between, he earned a degree from the [[Kent State University College of Podiatric Medicine|Ohio College of Podiatric Medicine]].&lt;ref name="PCA"/&gt;

His first job in the field of quality was that of test technician in the quality department at [[Powel Crosley, Jr.|Crosley Corporation]] in [[Richmond, Indiana]] beginning in 1952.  He left for a better-paying position as [[Reliability engineering|reliability engineer]] at [[Bendix Corporation]] in [[Mishawaka, Indiana]] in 1955, working on the [[RIM-8 Talos]] missile.  He left after less than two years to become senior quality engineer at [[Glenn L. Martin Company|The Martin Company]]'s new [[Orlando, Florida]] organization to develop the [[Pershing missile]].  There he developed the [[Zero Defects]] concept.&lt;ref name="Harwood"&gt;{{cite book | last = Harwood | first = William B. | title = Raise Heaven and Earth: The Story of Martin Marietta People and Their Pioneering Achievements | year = 1993 | publisher = [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] | location = [[New York City|New York]] | isbn = 9780671749989 | oclc = 28710737 | page = 350 | chapter = 27: "Zero Defects" Was Invented Here | quote = Zero Defects was the brainchild of a gifted and articulate young engineer named Philip Crosby, who conceived it while working as quality control manager on Pershing.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He eventually rose to become department head before leaving for [[ITT Corporation]] in 1965 to become director of quality.

==Philip Crosby Associates==
In 1979, Crosby started the [[management consulting]] company Philip Crosby Associates, Inc.&lt;ref name="PCA"/&gt; This consulting group provided educational courses in quality management both at their headquarters in [[Winter Park, Florida]], and at eight foreign locations. Also in 1979, Crosby published his first business book, ''Quality Is Free''. This book would become popular at the time because of the crisis in North American quality. During the late 1970s and into the 1980s, North American manufacturers were losing market share to Japanese products largely due to the superior quality of the Japanese goods.

Crosby's response to the quality crisis was the principle of  ''"doing it right the first time"'' (DIRFT).  He also included four major principles:&lt;ref name="Creech"&gt;{{cite book | last = Creech | first = Bill | authorlink = Wilbur L. Creech | title = The Five Pillars of TQM: How to Make Total Quality Management Work for You | year = 1994 | publisher = [[St. Martin's Press|Truman Talley Books]] | location = [[New York City|New York]] | isbn = 9780525937258 | oclc = 28508067 | page = 478 | chapter = 11: A TQM Path to Tomorrow:  New Ways for New Days}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:#''The definition of quality is conformance to requirements (requirements meaning both the product and the customer's requirements)
:#''The system of quality is prevention
:#''The performance standard is [[zero defects]] (relative to requirements)
:#''The measurement of quality is the [[Quality costs|price of nonconformance]]

His belief was that an organization that establishes good quality management principles will see savings returns that more than pay for the cost of the quality system: "quality is free". It is less expensive to do it right the first time than to pay for rework and repairs.

'''Procurement software''' is [[business software]] that helps to automate the purchasing function of organizations. Activities including raising and approving [[purchase order]]s, selecting and ordering the product or service, receiving and matching the invoice and order, and paying the bill is handled electronically, enabling the procurement department to see everything that is ordered, ensure that nothing can be ordered without correct approvals, and lets them get the best value by combining several orders for the same type of good or even getting suppliers to bid for the business.  Buying organisation's choice can be driven by the particular strengths offered by each individual system and the number of vendors available through them. A multinational or otherwise large organization will use a shared procurement system to take advantage of [[economies of scale]] to drive down the cost of purchases. While traditionally most e-procurement software systems have been designed for larger organizations, there are now also systems available for the SMB market, such as [https://free-procurement.com/about/ the Free-Procurement Project] and an open source alternative by ProcuMan. Whilst some services are available to purchase through automated systems, the key strength of these systems lies in the procurement of commodities that are much easier to standardise.

The key benefit for organisations using procurement software include ease of administration and potential long-term cost savings. Having a single interface for procurement related management information cuts down the time and effort required to monitor organisational spending. The use of such software also allows procurement managers to control the vendors used by the wider organisation so all employees take advantage of negotiated rates and other terms of service.

'''Proxy voting''' is a form of [[voting]] whereby a member of a decision-making body may delegate his or her voting power to a representative, to enable a vote in absence. The representative may be another member of the same body, or external. A person so designated is called a "proxy" and the person designating him or her is called a "principal". Proxy appointments can be used to form a [[voting bloc]] that can exercise greater influence in [[deliberation]]s or [[negotiation]]s.  Proxy voting is a particularly important practice with respect to corporations; in the United States, investment advisers often vote proxies on behalf of their client accounts.&lt;ref&gt;Lemke and Lins, ''Regulation of Investment Advisers'' (Thomson West, 2017 ed.).&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States parliamentary manual ''[[Riddick's Rules of Procedure]]'' notes that, under proxy voting, voting for officers should be done by ballot, due to the difficulties involved in authentication if a member simply calls out, "I cast 17 votes for Mr. X."&lt;ref name=RID&gt;{{cite parl|title=RID|pages=155–156|year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proxy voting is also an important feature in [[corporate governance]] through the [[proxy statement]]. Companies use proxy solicitation agencies like Boudicca Proxy Consultants to secure proxy votes.

==Legislatures==
The rules of some assemblies presently forbid proxy voting. For example, in both houses of the U.S. Congress, as well as in most if not all state legislatures, each member must be present and cast his own vote for that vote to be counted. This can result, however, in the absence of a quorum and the need to compel attendance by a sufficient number of missing members to get a quorum. See ''[[call of the house]]''.

It is possible for automatic proxy voting to be used in legislatures, by way of [[direct representation]] (this idea is essentially a form of [[Weighted voting]]). For example, it has been proposed that instead of electing members from single-member districts (that may have been [[gerrymander]]ed), members be elected at large, but when seated each member cast the number of votes he or she received in the last election. Thus, if, for example, a state were allocated 32 members in the U.S. House of Representatives, the 32 candidates who received the most votes in the at-large election would be seated, but each would cast a different number of votes on the floor and in committee. This proposal would allow for representation of minority views in legislative deliberations, as it does in deliberations at shareholder meetings of corporations.  Such a concept was proposed in a submission to the 2007 Ontario Citizens' Assembly process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citizensassembly.gov.on.ca/documents/633009991417391250_WVSubmissionNov12_0.pdf|title=Submission to Ontario Citizens' Assembly}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two real-life examples of weighted voting include the [[Council of Ministers of the European Union]] and the [[US Electoral College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whfreeman.com/college/pdfs/comappdfs/CoMap_c11.pdf |title=Article on Weighted Voting describing US Electoral College as an example }}{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Parliament of New Zealand]] allows proxy voting. Sections 155-156 of the Standing Orders of the [[New Zealand House of Representatives]] specify the procedures for doing so. A member can designate another member or a party to cast his vote. However, a party may not exercise proxies for more than 25% of its members (rounded upwards).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.nz/NR/rdonlyres/078D6043-9E03-4D87-93BA-A6BB84ACC063/6619/standingorders20095.pdf|title=Standing Orders of the House of Representatives|publisher=New Zealand House of Representatives|date=2005-08-12|accessdate=2008-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[New Zealand Listener]]'' notes a controversial occurrence of proxy voting. The [[Labour Party (New Zealand)|Labour Party]] was allowed to cast votes on behalf of [[Taito Phillip Field]], who was frequently absent. Theoretically, this was to be allowed only if a legislator was absent on parliamentary business, public business or pressing private business, such as illness or bereavement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.listener.co.nz/issue/3486/columnists/8250/nice_gig_for_some.html|title=Nice Gig for Some|author=Clifton, Jane|publisher=New Zealand Listener|date=March 2007|accessdate=2008-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] reforms of 1995 banished the practice, proxy voting was also used in [[U.S. House of Representatives]] committees. Often members would delegate their vote to the ranking member of their party in the committee. Republicans opposed proxy voting on the grounds that it allowed an indolent Democratic majority to move legislation through committee with antimajoritarian procedures. That is, the Democratic leader in the committee would successfully oppose the sitting Republican majority by wielding the proxies of absent Democrats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wvtv7Dhc7DwC&amp;pg=PA35&amp;dq=%22proxy+voting%22 |title=Participation in Congress - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-18 | first=Richard L. | last=Hall | isbn=978-0-300-06811-5|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas E. Mann and Norman J. Ornstein write, "In a large and fragmented institution in which every member has five or six places to be at any given moment, proxy voting is a necessary evil".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xdiv1tM4qWQC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=%22proxy+voting%22 |title=A first report of the Renewing ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-18 | first1=Thomas E. | last1=Mann | first2=Norman J. | last2=Ornstein | isbn=978-0-8157-5457-2|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elections==
Proxy voting is sometimes described as "the frequency with which spouses, union workers, and friends of friends are in effect sent off to the polls with an assignment to complete." The potential for proxy voting exists in roughly one voter out of five, and it is about twice as high at the middle levels of the sophistication continuum. According to W. Russell Neuman, the net effect of the cues provided by friends and associates is not likely to be as significant as those of the political parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wsJw8qPfpJAC&amp;pg=PA90&amp;dq=%22proxy+voting%22 |title=The paradox of mass politics ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-18 | isbn=978-0-674-65460-0|year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The possibility of expanded use of proxy voting has been the subject of much speculation. Terry F. Buss et al. write that [[internet voting]] would result in de facto approval of proxy voting, since passwords could be shared with others: "Obviously, cost-benefit calculations around the act of voting could also change substantially as organizations attempt to identify and provide inducements to control proxy votes without violating vote-buying prohibitions in the law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Modernizing Democracy|pages=208–209|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FlhFdTRCzOEC&amp;pg=PA209&amp;lpg=PA209&amp;dq=%2B%22proxy+voting%22+%2Bdemocracy|author1=Terry F. Buss |author2=F. Stevens Redburn |author3=Kristina Guo | isbn=978-0-7656-1763-7 | year=2006 | publisher=M.E. Sharpe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the criticisms of proxy voting is that it carries a risk of fraud or intimidation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=NREXAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%2B%22proxy+voting%22+%2Belectoral&amp;dq=%2B%22proxy+voting%22+%2Belectoral |title=Democracy at the polls: a ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date=2003-10-03 |accessdate=2010-03-18 | first1=David | last1=Butler | isbn=978-0-8447-3405-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another criticism is that it violates the concept of a secret ballot, in that paperwork may be filed, for instance, designating a party worker as one's proxy.&lt;ref name=realising&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=q0K4FbD-B6kC&amp;pg=PA55&amp;dq=%2B%22proxy+voting%22+%2Belectoral |title=Realising democracy: electoral law ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= November 2003|accessdate=2010-03-18 | first=Graeme | last=Orr | isbn=978-1-86287-481-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been proposed that proxy voting be combined with [[Initiatives and referendums in the United States|initiative and referendum]] to form a hybrid of [[direct democracy]] and [[representative democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://larson2008.com/wiki/index.php5?title%3DProxy_voting accessed October 21, 2008] {{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://makethecase.net/wiki/Referendums_with_local-member_proxy_voting_would_improve_governance |title=Referendums with local-member proxy voting would improve governance |publisher=MakeTheCase |date=2008-09-15 |accessdate=2010-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=June 2010}}
[[James C. Miller III]], [[Ronald Reagan]]'s budget director, suggested scrapping representative democracy and instead implementing a "program for direct and proxy voting in the legislative process."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/p5v2q4v611549777/ |title= A program for direct and proxy voting in the legislative process|publisher=SpringerLink |date= |accessdate=2010-03-18 |doi=10.1007/BF01718736 |volume=7-7 |journal=Public Choice |pages=107–113}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested by Joseph Francis Zimmerman that proxy voting be allowed in [[New England town meeting]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=y9lQ0hZQxhEC&amp;pg=PA179&amp;dq=%2B%22proxy+voting%22+%2Bdemocracy |title=The New England town meeting ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-18 | isbn=978-0-275-96523-5|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proxy voting can eliminate some of the problems associated with the [[public choice]] dilemma of [[bundling (public choice)|bundling]].

===Albania===
According to Arch Puddington et al., in Albanian Muslim areas, many women have been effectively disenfranchised through proxy voting by male relatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xN5O15Xzm1cC&amp;pg=PA478&amp;dq=%2B%22referendum%22+%2B%22proxy+voting%22 |title=Freedom in the World: The Annual ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date=2008-04-15 |accessdate=2010-03-18 | first=Arch | last=Puddington | isbn=978-0-7425-5897-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Algeria===
In Algeria, restrictions on proxy voting were instituted circa 1991 in order to undermine the [[Islamic Salvation Front]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ob9mn2RzL-4C&amp;pg=PA433&amp;dq=%2B%22proxy+voting%22+%2Belectoral |title=The government and politics of the ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-18 | first1=David E. | last1=Long | first2=Bernard | last2=Reich | isbn=978-0-8133-3899-6|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
In Canada, the province of Nova Scotia allows citizens to vote by proxy if they expect to be absent. The Territories of Yukon, Northwest Territories, and Nunavut also allow for proxy voting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elections.ca/loi/com2000/Voting/vot06_e.html |title=Compendium of Election Administration in Canada |publisher=Elections.ca |date= |accessdate=2010-03-18 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080316163259/http://www.elections.ca/loi/com2000/Voting/vot06_e.html |archivedate=2008-03-16 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Canadian prisoners of war in enemy camps were allowed to vote through proxy voting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=IHA8h0QrAZwC&amp;pg=PA139&amp;dq=%22proxy+voting%22 |title=Establishing the rules of the game ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-18 | first1=Louis | last1=Massicotte | first2=André | last2=Blais | first3=Antoine | last3=Yoshinaka | isbn=978-0-8020-8564-1|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Stewart and Keith Archer opine that proxy voting can result in leadership selection processes to become leader-dominated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xsa4vhIak-YC&amp;pg=PA91&amp;dq=%2B%22proxy+voting%22+%2B%22electoral+reform%22 |title=Quasi-Democracy: Parties and ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= 2001-02-01|accessdate=2010-03-18 | first1=David | last1=Stewart | first2=Keith | last2=Archer | isbn=978-0-7748-0791-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proxy voting had only been available to military personnel since World War II, but was extended in 1970 and 1977 to include voters in special circumstances such as northern camp operators, fishermen, and prospectors. The [[Alberta Liberal Party]] ran into some difficulties, in that an unknown number of proxy ballots that were counted may have been invalid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=VYbGRUp2YV0C&amp;pg=PA34&amp;dq=%2B%22proxy+voting%22+%2Belectoral |title=Elections - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= 2005-01-01|accessdate=2010-03-18 | first=John C. | last=Courtney | isbn=978-0-7748-0918-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who, through proxy voting or assistance of invalids, become knowledgeable of the principal's choice are bound to secrecy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GLcsAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%2B%22proxy+voting%22+%2Belectoral&amp;dq=%2B%22proxy+voting%22+%2Belectoral |title=Political rights: the legal ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date=2007-03-02 |accessdate=2010-03-18 | isbn=978-0-409-81601-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
Some [[Chinese provinces]] allow village residents to designate someone to vote on their behalf. Lily L. Tsai notes that "In practice, one family member often casts votes for everyone in the family even if they are present for the election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lily L. Tsai|page=207|title=Accountability Without Democracy: Solidary Groups and Public Goods Provision|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, a [[Carter Center]] delegation recommended abolishing the proxy voting that allowed one person to vote for three; the [[International Republican Institute]] had made a similar recommendation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=upDNEYtw4uYC&amp;pg=PA129&amp;dq=%2B%22proxy+voting%22+%2Belectoral |title=Elections and democracy in greater China - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-18 | first1=Larry | last1=Diamond | isbn=978-0-19-924417-1|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proxy voting also became an issue in relation to many of the [[Wenzhou]] people doing business outside.{{clarify|date=September 2015}} Most election disputes revolved around proxy votes, including the issues of who could represent them to vote and what kinds of evidence were acceptable for proxy voting. Intense competition made the proxy voting process more and more formal and transparent. Some villages required a [[notary]] to validate faxed proxy votes; some villages asked for [[fax]]ed signatures; more often villages publicized those proxy votes so that villagers could directly monitor them. [[Taicang]] government reported a 99.4% voter turnout in its 1997 election, but a study showed that after removing proxy votes, only 48% of the eligible voters in the sample reported that they actually went to the central polling station to vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jvSNIhVzR9sC&amp;pg=PA208&amp;dq=%2B%22proxy+voting%22+%2Belectoral |title=Marketization and Democracy in China - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= 2008-04-28|accessdate=2010-03-18 | first=Jianjun | last=Zhang | isbn=978-0-415-45222-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gabon===
According to Mim Kelber, "in Central Africa, all it takes for a man to cast a proxy vote for his wife is to produce an unwitnessed letter mentioning the name of the person to whom the voting power is delegated." The Gabon respondent to an [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]] letter commented, "It has been observed that this possibility was exploited to a far greater extent by men than by women, for reasons not always noble."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=fXDV3HQTtPcC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq=%2B%22proxy+voting%22+%2Belectoral |title=Women and government: new ways to ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-18 | first=Mim | last=Kelber | isbn=978-0-275-94816-0|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Guyana===
Proxy voting played an important role in [[Guyana]] politics in the 1960s. Prior to and during the 1961 elections, proxies had been severely restricted. Some restrictions were lifted, and there was a rise in proxy votes cast from 300 in 1961 to 6,635 in 1964. After that election, the [[Commonwealth Team of Observers]] voiced concern about proxy votes being liable to fraud. The proxy voting rules were relaxed further, and in 1969, official figures recorded 19,287 votes cast by proxy, about 7% of the total votes cast (an increase from 2.5% in 1964 to 1968).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=NkPBlZDGYCkC&amp;pg=PA359&amp;dq=%2B%22proxy+voting%22+%2Belectoral |title=Elections in the Americas: a data ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= 2005-06-03|accessdate=2010-03-18 | isbn=978-0-19-928357-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amidst allegations of fraud, more restrictions were placed on proxy voting in 1973; in that year, about 10,000 votes were cast by proxy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jagan.org/articles5i.htm |title=Virtual Army Coup In Guyana |author=Jagan, Cheddi |year=2000 |accessdate=2008-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080317025214/http://jagan.org/articles5i.htm |archivedate=2008-03-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===

In 2003, India's [[People's Representative Act]] was amended to allow armed forces personnel to appoint a proxy to vote on their behalf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2004/apr/23guest.htm|title=Democracy, bureaucracy and armed forces|author=Kolhe, Avinash|date=2004-04-23|publisher=Rediff|accessdate=2008-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iraq===
In Iraq, the Electoral Laws of 1924 and 1946 ruled out the possibility of proxy voting, except for illiterates, who could appoint someone to write for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=BVFBXa69tWMC&amp;pg=PA89&amp;dq=%2B%22proxy+voting%22+%2Belectoral |title=Elections in Asia and the Pacific: A ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-18 | isbn=978-0-19-924958-9|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russia===
Some instances of proxy voting (usually by family members) in the Russian parliamentary elections of 1995 were noted by observers from the [[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=m0W9KIzhJysC&amp;pg=PA134&amp;dq=%2B%22proxy+voting%22+%2Belectoral |title=The Russian parliamentary elections ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-18 | first1=Laura | last1=Belin | first2=Robert W. | last2=Orttung | isbn=978-0-7656-0084-4|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
The provision for proxy voting in the UK dates back to [[James I of England|James I]]. Long before [[women's suffrage]], women sometimes voted as proxies for absent male family heads.

Under British electoral law, ballot papers could not be sent overseas.&lt;ref name=realising/&gt; British expatriates had no right to vote until the mid-1980s. They can now vote by proxy in general elections if they have been on a British electoral register at some point in the past 15 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fairvote.org/?page=164&amp;articlemode=showspecific&amp;showarticle=133 |title=Overseas Voters |publisher=FairVote |date= |accessdate=2010-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can also vote by post.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aboutmyvote.co.uk/register_to_vote/british_citizens_living_abroad.aspx |title=British citizens living abroad - About my vote, produced by The Electoral Commission |publisher=Aboutmyvote.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-10-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110117185354/http://www.aboutmyvote.co.uk/register_to_vote/british_citizens_living_abroad.aspx |archivedate=2011-01-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, electors may appoint a proxy. An elector can only act as a proxy for two people to whom they are not directly related. However, they can be a proxy for any number of electors if they are directly related to those electors. The voter can change his mind and vote in the election personally as long as his proxy has not already voted on his behalf or applied to [[vote by mail]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spelthorne.gov.uk/cou_elections_absent_voting.htm|title=Absent Voting|publisher=Spelthorne Borough Council|year=2006|accessdate=2008-02-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080316124154/http://www.spelthorne.gov.uk/cou_elections_absent_voting.htm|archive-date=2008-03-16|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Voters must provide a reason for using a proxy, such as being away on vacation. A narrower subset of reasons is permissible if the proxy is to be for more than one election. Except in cases of blindness, the validity of all proxies must be certified by someone such as an employer or doctor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rochdale.gov.uk/council_and_democracy/councillors,_democracy_and_ele/elections_-_voting.aspx |title=Elections - voting |publisher=Rochdale Metropolitan Borough Council |accessdate=2008-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080316052802/http://www.rochdale.gov.uk/council_and_democracy/councillors%2C_democracy_and_ele/elections_-_voting.aspx |archivedate=2008-03-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In 1635–36, Massachusetts granted to the frontier towns "liberty to stay soe many of their freemen at home for the safety of their towne as they judge needful, and that the said freemen that are appoyncted by the towne to stay at home shall have liberty for this court to send their voices by proxy." According to Charles Seymour and Donald Paige Frary, had not proxy voting been implemented, the inhabitants of the frontier towns would have lost their franchises, and the government would have represented only the freemen in the vicinity of Boston. The roads were poor; the drawing of all a village's men at once would have exposed it to Indian attacks; and at election time, the emigrants' labor was needed to get the spring planting into the ground. As late as 1680, and probably even after the charter was revoked in 1684, the Freeman might give his vote for Magistrates in person or proxy at the Court of Elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=77gVT0hwLFoC&amp;pg=PA87&amp;dq=%2B%22proxy+voting%22+%2Belectoral |title=Boston and its story, 1630-1915 - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date=1909-01-31 |accessdate=2010-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Maryland, the [[primary assembly|primary assemblies]] allowed proxy voting. After the assembly of 1638, protests were sent to the proprietor in England. It was said that the Governor and his friends were able to exercise too much influence through the proxies they had obtained.

Proxy voting was also used in South Carolina; the proprietors in September 1683 complained to the governor about this system. Proxy voting was used in [[Long Island]], New York as well, at that time. Phraseology was sometimes designed to hide the fact that a proxy system was in use and that the majority of voters did not actually attend the elections. In Rhode Island, the system described as a "proxy" system, from 1664 onward, was actually simply the sending of written ballots from voters who did not attend the election, rather than a true proxy system, as in the assembly of 1647.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=vUNVCafgSHkC&amp;pg=PA437&amp;lpg=PA437&amp;dq=%2Bproxy+%2B%22town+meeting%22 |title=The suffrage franchise in the ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date=2006-07-24 |accessdate=2010-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Progressive Era]], proxy voting was used in Republican Party state conventions in New Hampshire. The [[Boston and Maine Railroad]], the Republican Party's ally, maintained control over the Party by means of these conventions. "At the 1906 state convention, for instance, party delegates were quite willing to trade, sell, or exchange their voting power in return for various forms of remuneration from the party machine. Public outcry led to the end of such 'proxy' voting".&lt;ref name=stormy&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=yXjbv-18NY4C&amp;pg=PA8&amp;dq=%2B%22proxy+voting%22+%2B%22progressive+era%22 |title=Stormy weather: the New Hampshire ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= 2003-11-18|accessdate=2010-03-18 | first=Dante J. | last=Scala | isbn=978-0-312-29622-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States law on proxies====
{{Expert needed|Law|section|date=October 2008}}&lt;!-- What do these citations mean, and are the texts online? Are there citation templates for this? --&gt;
Proxy is defined by supreme courts as "an ''authority'' or power to ''do'' a certain thing."&lt;ref&gt;149 Pa. 84, 29 Atl. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; A person can confer on his proxy any power which he himself possesses. He may also give him secret instructions as to voting upon particular questions.&lt;ref&gt;Ky. L. Rep. 204; 103 Wash. 254.&lt;/ref&gt; But a proxy is ineffectual when it is contrary to law or public policy.&lt;ref&gt;98 Ala. 92; 12 So. 723.&lt;/ref&gt; Where the proxy is duly appointed and he acts within the scope of the proxy, the person authorizing the proxy is bound by his appointee's acts, including his errors or mistakes.&lt;ref&gt;122 Mo. App. 437, 99 S.W. 902.&lt;/ref&gt; When the appointer sends his appointee to a meeting, the proxy may do anything at that meeting necessary to a full and complete exercise of the appointer's right to vote at such meeting. This includes the right to vote to take the vote by ballot, or to adjourn (and, hence, he may also vote on other ordinary parliamentary motions, such as to refer, postpone, reconsider, etc., when necessary or when deemed appropriate and advantageous to the overall object or purpose of the proxy).&lt;ref&gt;13 Pa. County Ct. 576.&lt;/ref&gt;

A proxy cannot vote when the principal himself is present and votes. He can vote only in the principal's absence.&lt;ref&gt;181 Iowa 1013, 165 N.W. 854.&lt;/ref&gt; Where the authority conferred upon a proxy is limited to a designated or special purpose, a vote for another and different purpose is ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;112 Ala. 228, 20 So. 744.&lt;/ref&gt; A proxy in the usual, ordinary form confers authority to act only at the meeting then in contemplation, and in any adjourned-meetings of the same; hence, it may not be voted at another or different meeting held under a ''new call''.&lt;ref&gt;150 N.C. 216, 63 S.E. 892.&lt;/ref&gt; A proxy's unauthorized acts may be [[ratified]] by his appointer, and such ratification is equivalent to previous authority.&lt;ref&gt;109 Cal. 571, 42 Pac. 225.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the weight of authority, a proxy only to vote stock may be revoked at any time, notwithstanding any agreement that it shall be irrevocable.&lt;ref&gt;30 Fed. 91; 207 Ill. 107; 101 Ky. 570; 61 N.J. Eq. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The sale in the meantime by a stockholder of his shares in a corporation or company automatically revokes any proxies made or given to vote in respect of such shares.&lt;ref&gt;89 Fed. 397.&lt;/ref&gt; And a proxy is also revoked where the party giving it attends the election in person, or gives subsequent proxy.&lt;ref&gt;78 N.J. Eq. 484; 10 Md. 468.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, a proxy cannot vote when the owner of the stock arrives late or is present and votes.&lt;ref&gt;181 Iowa 1013, 165 N.W. 254.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vietnam===
In Vietnam, proxy voting was used to increase turnout. Presently, proxy voting is illegal, but it has nonetheless been occurring since before 1989. It is estimated to contribute about 20% to voter turnout, and has been described as "a convenient way to fulfil one's duty, avoid possible risks, and avoid having to participate directly in the act of voting". It is essentially a compromise between the party-state, which wants to have high turnouts as proof of public support, and voters who do not want to go to the polling stations. In the Soviet Union, proxy voting was also illegal but done in order to increase turnout figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=hfsr1lzAOGoC&amp;pg=PA145&amp;dq=%2B%22proxy+voting%22+%2Belectoral |title=Wards of Hanoi - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-18 | isbn=978-981-230-341-7|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proxy voting is automatically prohibited in organizations that have adopted [[Robert's Rules of Order|Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised]] (RONR) or [[The Standard Code of Parliamentary Procedure]] (TSC) as their parliamentary authority, unless it is provided for in its bylaws or charter or required by the laws of its state of incorporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.robertsrules.com/faq.html#10|title = Frequently Asked Questions about RONR (Question 10)|date = |accessdate = |website = The Official Robert's Rules of Order Web Site|publisher = The Robert's Rules Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TSC/&gt; Robert's Rules says, "If the law under which an organization is incorporated allows proxy voting to be prohibited by a provision of the bylaws, the adoption of this book as parliamentary authority by prescription in the bylaws should be treated as sufficient provision to accomplish that result".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite parl|pages = 429|edition = 11th|year = 2011|title = RONR}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[George Demeter|Demeter]] says the same thing, but also states that "if these laws do ''not'' prohibit voting by proxy, the body can pass a law permitting proxy voting for any purpose desired."&lt;ref name=DEM&gt;{{cite parl|title=DEM|pages=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; RONR opines, "Ordinarily it should neither be allowed nor required, because proxy voting is incompatible with the essential characteristics of a deliberative assembly in which membership is individual, personal, and nontransferable. In a stock corporation, on the other hand, where the ownership is transferable, the voice and vote of the member also is transferable, by use of a proxy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite parl|title = RONR|pages = 428-429|year = 2011|edition = 11th}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Riddick opines that "proxy voting properly belongs in incorporate organizations that deal with stocks or real estate, and in certain political organizations," it also states, "If a state empowers an incorporated organization to use proxy voting, that right cannot be denied in the bylaws." Riddick further opines, "Proxy voting is not recommended for ordinary use. It can discourage attendance, and transfers an inalienable right to another without positive assurance that the vote has not been manipulated."&lt;ref name=RID/&gt;

''Parliamentary Law'' expounds on this point:&lt;ref name=pl&gt;{{cite book|title=Parliamentary Law|author=Robert, Henry M.|year=1991|isbn=0-470-72592-3|pages=194–195, 564}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|It is used only in stock corporations where the control is in the majority of the stock, not in the majority of the stockholders. If one person gets control of fifty-one per cent of the stock he can control the corporation, electing such directors as he pleases in defiance of the hundreds or thousands of holders of the remaining stock. The laws for stock corporations are nearly always made on the theory that the object of the organization is to make money by carrying on a certain business, using capital supplied by a large number of persons whose control of the business should be in proportion to the capital they have put into the concern. The people who have furnished the majority of the capital should control the organization, and yet they may live in different parts of the country, or be traveling at the time of the annual meeting. By the system of proxy voting they can control the election of directors without attending the meetings.}}

Nonetheless, it is common practice in conventions for a delegate to have an alternate, who is basically the same as a proxy. [[Demeter's Manual of Parliamentary Law and Procedure|Demeter's Manual]] notes that the alternate has all the privileges of voting, debate and participation in the proceedings to which the delegate is entitled.&lt;ref name=DEM/&gt; Moreover, "if voting has for years...been conducted...by proxy...such voting by long and continuous custom has the force of law, and the proceedings are valid."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite parl|title=DEM|pages=134|edition=1969|year=1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas E. Arend notes that U.S. laws allow proxy votes to be conducted electronically in certain situations: "The use of electronic media may be permissible for proxy voting, but such voting is generally limited to members. Given the fiduciary duties that are personal to each director, and the need for directors to deliberate to ensure properly considered decisions, proxy voting by directors is usually prohibited by statute. In contrast, a number of state nonprofit corporate statutes allow for member proxy voting and may further allow members to use electronic media to grant a proxy right to another party for member voting purposes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/summary_0199-1341084_ITM|author=Arend, Thomas E.|title=Legal Implications of Electronic Governance|publisher=Association Management|date=2002-01-01|accessdate=2008-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sturgis agrees, "Directors or board members cannot vote by proxy in their meetings, since this would mean the delegation of a discretionary legislative duty which they cannot delegate."&lt;ref name=TSC&gt;{{cite parl|title=TSC|pages=147–148|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proxy voting, even if allowed, may be limited to infrequent use if the rules governing a body specify minimum attendance requirements. For instance, bylaws may prescribe that a member can be dropped for missing three consecutive meetings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://myfloridalegal.com/ago.nsf/Opinions/F8811A3863EA18F08525659300664072|title=Advisory Legal Opinion - AGO 78-117|author=Gleason, Patricia R.|publisher=Office of the Attorney General of Florida|date=1978-09-19|accessdate=2008-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Journal of Mental Science noted the arguments raised against adopting proxy voting for the Association. These included that possibility that it would diminish attendance at  meetings.

==Corporate settings==
{{Main|Proxy statement}}
Under the [[common law]], shareholders had no right to cast votes by proxy in corporate meetings without special authorization. In ''Walker v. Johnson'',&lt;ref&gt;D.C. App. 144 (1900)&lt;/ref&gt; the [[District of Columbia Court of Appeals|Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia]] explained that the reason was that early corporations were of a municipal, religious or charitable nature, in which the shareholder had no pecuniary interest. The normal mode of conferring corporate rights was by an issue of a charter from the crown, essentially establishing the corporation as a part of the government. Given the personal trust placed in these voters by the king, it was inappropriate for them to delegate to others. In the Pennsylvania case of ''Commonwealth ex rel. Verree v. Bringhurst'',&lt;ref&gt;103 Pa. St. 134 (1883)&lt;/ref&gt; the court held that members of a corporation had no right to vote by proxy at a corporate election unless such right was expressly conferred by the charter or by a bylaw. The attorneys for the plaintiff argued that the common law rules had no application to trading or moneyed corporations where the relation was not personal. The court found, "The fact that it is a business corporation in no wise dispenses with the obligation of all members to assemble together, unless otherwise provided, for the exercise of a right to participate in the election of their officers." At least as early as the 18th century, however, clauses permitting voting by proxy were being inserted in corporate charters in England.&lt;ref&gt;Axe, Leonard H. ''Michigan Law Review'' Vol. 41, No. 1 (Aug. 1942) p. 38-65&lt;/ref&gt;

Proxy voting is commonly used in corporations for voting by members or shareholders, because it allows members who have confidence in the judgment of other members to vote for them and allows the assembly to have a quorum of votes when it is difficult for all members to attend, or there are too many members for all of them to conveniently meet and deliberate. [[Proxy firm]]s commonly advise institutional shareholders on how they should vote. Proxy solicitation firms assist in helping corral votes for a certain resolution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foe.org/international/shareholder/solicitation.html Proxy Solicitation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080128155800/http://www.foe.org/international/shareholder/solicitation.html |date=January 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Domini notes that in the corporate world, "Proxy ballots typically contain proposals from company management on issues of corporate governance, including capital structure, auditing, board composition, and executive compensation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Proxy Voting Guidelines &amp; Procedures |url=http://www.domini.com/common/pdf/ProxyVotingGuidelines.pdf |publisher=Domini Social Investments |accessdate=2008-02-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411094628/http://www.domini.com/common/pdf/ProxyVotingGuidelines.pdf |archivedate=2008-04-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proxies are essentially the corporate law equivalent of [[absentee balloting]]. Shareholders send in a card (called a proxy card) on which they mark their vote. The card authorizes a proxy agent to vote the shareholder's stock as directed on the card. The proxy card may specify how shares are to be voted or may simply give the proxy agent discretion to decide how the shares are to be voted. Under [[Securities Exchange Commission]] Rule 14a-3, the incumbent board of directors' first step in soliciting proxies must be the distribution to shareholders of the firm's annual report. An insurgent may independently prepare proxy cards and proxy statements, which are sent to the shareholders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Complete Guide to Sarbanes-Oxley|author=Bainbridge, Stephen M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Associations of [[institutional investor]]s sometimes attempt to effect social change.

These organizations commonly exercise influence through [[shareholder resolution]]s, which may spur management to action and lead to the resolutions' withdrawal before an actual vote on the resolution is taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iccr.org/news/press_releases/2008/pr_proxybook011508.htm |title=302 Religious/Social Investor Proxy Resolutions Slated for 2008 |publisher=Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility |date=2008-01-15 |accessdate=2008-02-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080316192547/http://www.iccr.org/news/press_releases/2008/pr_proxybook011508.htm |archivedate=2008-03-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fiduciaries for ERISA and other pension plans are generally expected to vote proxies on behalf of these plans in a manner than maximizes the economic value for plan participants.  In these regard, for ERISA plans, fiduciaries and advisers are very limited in the extent to which they can take social or other goals into account.&lt;ref&gt;Lemke and Lins, ''ERISA for Money Managers'' (Thomson West, 2017-2018 ed.).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the absence of his principal from the annual meeting of a business corporation, the proxy has the right to vote in all instances, but he has not the right to debate or otherwise participate in the proceedings unless he is a stockholder in that same corporation.&lt;ref name=DEM/&gt;

The [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] has ruled that an investment adviser who exercises voting authority over his clients' proxies has a fiduciary responsibility to adopt policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that the adviser votes proxies in the best interests of clients, to disclose to clients information about those policies and procedures, to disclose to clients how they may obtain information on how the adviser has voted their proxies, and to keep certain records related to proxy voting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/ia-2106.htm|title=Final Rule: Proxy Voting by Investment Advisers|publisher=Securities Exchange Commission|date=2003-01-31|accessdate=2008-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ruling has been criticized on many grounds, including the contention that it places unnecessary burdens on investment advisers and would not have prevented the major [[accounting scandals]] of the early 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa4048/is_200301/ai_n9223584|title=Disclosure of the Irrelevant?: Impact of the SEC's Final Proxy Voting Disclosure Rules|publisher=Fordham Journal of Corporate &amp; Financial Law|author=Stewart, Brian D.|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mutual funds must report their proxy votes periodically on Form N-PX.&lt;ref&gt;Lemke, Lins and Smith, ''Regulation of Investment Companies'' (Matthew Bender, 2017 ed.).&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible for [[overvote]]s and [[undervote]]s to occur in corporate proxy situations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/spotlight/proxyprocess/proxyvotingbrief.htm Briefing Paper: Roundtable on Proxy Voting Mechanics. Retrieved March 9, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

Even in corporate settings, proxy voting's use is generally limited to voting at the annual meeting for directors, for the ratification of acts of the directors, for enlargement or diminution of capital, and for other vital changes in the policy of the organization. These proposed changes are summarized in the circular sent to shareholders prior to the annual meeting. The stock-transfer book is closed at least ten days before the annual meeting, to enable the secretary to prepare a list of stockholders and the number of shares held by each. Stock is voted as shown by the stock book when posted. All proxies are checked against this list.&lt;ref name=pl/&gt;

It is possible to designate two or more persons to act as proxy by using language appointing, for instance, "A, B, C, D, and E, F, or any of them, attorneys and agents for me, irrevocable, with full power by the affirmative vote of a majority of said attorneys and agents to appoint a substitute or substitutes for and in the name and stead of me."&lt;ref name=pl/&gt;

Proxy voting is said to have some anti-deliberative consequences, in that proxy holders often lack discretion about how to cast votes due to the instructions given by their principal. Thus, they cannot alter their decision based on the deliberative process of testing the strength of arguments and counter-arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=BjW8Cfwn8FEC&amp;pg=PA135&amp;dq=%22proxy+voting%22 |title=The constitutional corporation ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-18 | first=Stephen | last=Bottomley | isbn=978-0-7546-2418-9|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany, corporate proxy voting is done through banks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.germanlawjournal.com/article.php?id=710 |title=Shareholder Protection in the USA and Germany - On the Fallacy of LLSV |author=Braendle, Uno C. |date=2006-03-01 |publisher=German Law Journal |accessdate=2008-02-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080316110429/http://www.germanlawjournal.com/article.php?id=710 |archivedate=2008-03-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Proxy voting by banks has been a key feature of the connection of banks to corporate ownership in Germany since the industrialization period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Corporate Governance Around the World|author=Morck, Randall|page=258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Delegated voting==
{{See also|Delegative democracy}}
[[File:Democracy.svg|thumb|170px|Illustration of delegated voting. Voters to the left of the blue line voted by delegation. Voters to the right voted directly. Numbers are the quantity of voters represented by each delegate, with the delegate included in the count.]]
In '''delegated voting''', the proxy is [[transitive relation|transitive]] and the transfer recursive. Put simply, the vote may be further delegated to the proxy's proxy, and so on. This is also called transitive proxy or delegate cascade.&lt;ref name='Allan-2008'&gt;{{citation |author=Michael Allan |year=2008 |title=A Medium of Assent and its Fit with Society |journal=The ITP News: Newsletter of the Information Technology and Politics Section, American Political Science Association |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=12–13| url=http://www.apsanet.org/~itp/v4n2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early proposal of delegate voting was that of [[Lewis Carroll]] in 1884.&lt;ref name='Carrol-1884'&gt;{{cite book |last=Carroll |first=Lewis |year=1884 |title=The Principles of Parliamentary Representation |publisher=Harrison and Sons |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Duncan-1969'&gt;{{cite journal |last=Black |first=Duncan |year=1969 |title=Lewis Carroll and the theory of games |journal=The American Economic Review |volume=59 |issue=2 |page=210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Delegate voting is used by the Swedish local political party [[Demoex]]. Demoex won their first seat in the city council of Vallentuna, [[Sweden]], in 2002. The first years of activity in the party have been evaluated by [[Mitthögskolan University]] in a paper by Karin Ottesen in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://demoex.net/files/Ottesensuppsats.pdf|title=Flexible representation by use of delegated voting - a case study of practical use|first=Karin|last=Ottesen|year=2003|accessdate=2009-02-23|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Demoex, a voter can also vote directly, even if she has delegated her vote to a proxy; the direct vote overrules the proxy vote. It is also possible to change the proxy at any time.

In 2005, in a pilot study in Pakistan, ''Structural Deep Democracy, SD2''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://groups.yahoo.com/group/sd-2/ |title=Yahoo! Groups |publisher=Groups.yahoo.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.148.9274 |title=CiteSeerX — Autopoietic Information Systems in Modern Organizations |publisher=Citeseerx.ist.psu.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; was used for leadership selection in a sustainable agriculture group called Contact Youth. SD2 uses [[PageRank]] for the processing of the transitive proxy votes, with the additional constraints of mandating at least two initial proxies per voter, and all voters are proxy candidates. More complex variants can be built on top of SD2, such as adding specialist proxies and direct votes for specific issues, but SD2 as the underlying umbrella system, mandates that generalist proxies should always be used.

Delegated voting is also used in the World Parliament Experiment, and in implementations of [[delegative democracy]], which is also known as [[liquid democracy]].

'''Records in Contexts''', or '''RiC''', is a conceptual model and [[ontology]] for the archival description of records, designed by the Expert Group on Archival Description (EGAD) established by the [[International Council on Archives|International Council on Archives (ICA)]]. The EGAD initially began work on the standard between 2012 and 2016, with a conceptual model (RiC-CM) and an ontology (RiC-O) released for comment during 2016.&lt;ref name=RiCICApres2016&gt;{{cite web|title=Presentation of the standard "Records in Context"|work=P138 Records in Contexts (RiC): a standard for archival description developed by the ICA Experts Group on Archival Description|publisher=International Council on Archives, Paris|date=8 September 2016|author1=Daniel Pitti|author2= Bill Stockting|author3=Florence Clavaud|url=https://www.ica.org/en/presentation-standard-records-context-thursday-8-september-1500|accessdate=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==

The Conceptual Model aims to bring together the Council's current descriptive standards, namely the [[ISAD(G)|General International Standard Archival Description (ISAD(G))]], [[ISAAR(CPF)|International Standard Archival Authority Records — Corporate Bodies, Persons, and Families (ISAAR(CPF))]], International Standard Description of Functions (ISDF), and International Standard Description of Institutions with Archival Holdings (ISDIAH).&lt;ref name=RiCv01&gt;{{cite web|title=Records in Contexts: A conceptual model for archival description|url=https://www.ica.org/sites/default/files/RiC-CM-0.1.pdf|work=Consultation Draft v0.1|date=September 2016|publisher=Experts Group On Archival Description, International Council on Archives|accessdate=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; RiC also aims to be better suited to the management of electronic records than previous standards, whilst still supporting traditional analogue materials.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, Carl, ''Researchers, practitioners and their use of the archived web. IIPC Web Archiving Conference 15th June 2017''. (2017) &lt;https://blogs.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/archivesandmanuscripts/2017/06/20/researcherspractitioners-and-their-use-of-the-archived-web-iipc-web-archiving-conference-15th-june-2017/&gt; [accessed 3 August 2017].&lt;/ref&gt; It defines the primary descriptive entities of the model, and how these interrelate within archival description. RiC also aims to modernise the aging current standards, by enabling archival description to better capture the complex relationships records have with each other, and with their creators, holders, and subjects. These groups, individuals, and organisations are referred to as "agents" in RiC. Through these relationships, RiC aims to provide a richer descriptive context than the hierarchical structure of ISAD(G).&lt;ref name=BFPonRiC2016&gt;{{cite web|author=Bogdan Florin Popovici, director Romanian National Archives|title=Records In Contexts; Towards A New Level In Archival Description?|url=http://www.pokarh-mb.si/uploaded/datoteke/Radenci/radenci_2016/013-031_popovici_2016.pdf|date=2016|publisher=Pokrajinski arhiv Maribor|accessdate=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response==

The conceptual model was published for comment in 2016. Among the responses, some have shown confusion as to how it should be applied in practice. A consultation meeting of the [[Archives and Records Association]]'s Archives and Technology group expressed uncertainty over how the conceptual model should be interpreted by the profession, and how they would engage with and benefit from it in the future.&lt;ref name=ResultsperJB&gt;{{cite web|author=Jenny Bunn|url=http://www.archives.org.uk/about/community/groups/viewbulletin/59-results-of-the-ara-sat-consultation-on-records-in-contexts.html?groupid=21|title=Results of the ARA SAT consultation on Records in Contexts|date=19 December 2016|accessdate=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their response, the [[Digital_preservation#InterPARES|InterPARES Trust]] state that a more inclusive development process should have been used given the potentially international application of the model, referring especially to the under-representation of Africa and Asia (acknowledged by EGAD in their introduction to the RiC-CM). Their response also questions the integration of the entire suite of current ICA descriptive standards without first gauging the extent to which these are currently implemented globally.

==OWL Ontology==

Although in the future EGAD will develop an OWL ontology called RiC-O to represent RiC-CM, there is already an ontology proposal based on the draft of the conceptual model&lt;ref&gt;Llanes-Padrón, D., Pastor-Sánchez, J.A.

'''Rodolfo Cuenca''', sometimes known by his nickname, '''Rudy Cuenca''', is a Filipino businessman best known as the former chairman of the Construction and Development Corporation of the Philippines (CDCP), which is known today as the [[Philippine National Construction Corporation]].&lt;ref name="Muego1983"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Muego |first=Benjamin N. |date=1983-11-01 |title=The Executive Committee in the Philippines: Successors, Power Brokers, and Dark Horses |url=http://as.ucpress.edu/content/23/11/1159 |journal=Asian Survey |language=en |volume=23 |issue=11 |pages=1159–1170 |doi=10.2307/2644365 |issn=0004-4687}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a close associate of [[Ferdinand Marcos]], and is noted not to be embarrassed by "''his much-criticized close association with Marcos and his being tagged as a crony.''"&lt;ref name="AmandoDoronila20100927"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20100927-294524/Crony-tells-of-rivalry-in-Marcos-inner-circle |title=Crony Tells of Rivalry in Marcos Inner Circle |last=Doronila |first=Armando |date=2010-09-27 |work=Philippine Daily Inquirer |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100928103753/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20100927-294524/Crony-tells-of-rivalry-in-Marcos-inner-circle |archive-date=2010-09-28 |dead-url=Yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education ==
Rodolfo Cuenca was born on May 1, 1928, at the Philippine General Hospital, to Nicolas and Cristina Cuenca. He is the eldest among four children. Cuenca spent his early years in Vigan, as his father was assigned district engineer in Ilocos Sur. In 1937, the family transferred to Bulacan, where Cuenca finished his fourth and fifth grade. He continued sixth grade in Ateneo de Manila on Padre Faura, then transferred to the Intramuros campus for his seventh grade.&lt;ref name="Dalisay2010"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/693684262 |title=Builder of bridges : the Rudy Cuenca story |last=Dalisay |first=Jose Y. |isbn=9789712724619 |location=Manila |oclc=693684262}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Second World War, Cuenca withdrew from high school and worked some jobs, one of which was at the General Engineering Depot for the US Army in Malolos. In 1946, he returned to Ateneo to finish high school. He then enrolled in Far Eastern University to study commerce,&lt;ref name="Dalisay2010"/&gt; but soon dropped out to work as a road contractor.&lt;ref name="Manapat1991" /&gt; On 2 January 1948, he married Yasmin Santos, whom Cuenca met in Angat, Bulacan.&lt;ref name="Dalisay2010" /&gt;

== Association with Ferdinand Marcos ==
Cuenca financially donated to Ferdinand Marcos' first presidential campaign in 1965.&lt;ref name="Dalisay2010" /&gt; In his second year of presidency, Marcos awarded large-scale projects to Cuenca's company, Cuenca Construction Company, which later became part of the Construction and Development Corporation of the Philippines (CDCP).&lt;ref name=phreader&gt;{{cite book |last1=Schirmer |first1=Daniel |title=The Philippines Reader: A History of Colonialism, Neocolonialism, Dictatorship, and Resistance |date=1987 |publisher=South End Press |isbn=9780896082755 |page=171 |edition=illustrated |url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=TXE73VWcsEEC&amp;lpg=PA171&amp;ots=9944UvjkvI&amp;dq=Rodolfo%20Cuenca%20san%20juanico%20bridge&amp;pg=PA171#v=onepage&amp;q=Rodolfo%20Cuenca%20san%20juanico%20bridge&amp;f=false |accessdate=12 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the Republic Act (RA) 3741, private contractors were allowed to bid for government infrastructure projects. In 1967, CDCP won government contracts to build the Manila North and South Expressways, valued in just over $16 million.&lt;ref name="Dalisay2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Manapat1991" /&gt; The company maintained its favored treatment until the early 80s, for the benefit Cuenca and Marcos, both of whom divided and funneled commissions and kickbacks into their own pockets.&lt;ref name="Manapat1991" /&gt;

According to Cuenca, it was in also in 1967 when he started joining Marcos to play golf, along with Robert "Bobby" Benedicto, the latter's classmate in UP Law School, and the former's close friend since the 1950s.&lt;ref name="MartialLawMuseumCronyism"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://martiallawmuseum.ph/magaral/the-philippines-during-the-martial-law/|title=It Takes a Village to Loot a Nation: Cronyism and Corruption|last=|first=|date=|website=Martial Law Museum|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dalisay2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AmandoDoronila20100929"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Doronila |first1=Amando |title=The power brokers during martial law |url=https://www.pressreader.com/philippines/philippine-daily-inquirer/20100929/283051230787608 |accessdate=12 June 2018 |work=Philippine Daily Inquirer |date=29 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; These frequent golf sessions would continue well into the Martial Law era. For Marcos' re-election campaign in 1969, Cuenca again played the role of fundraiser.&lt;ref name="Dalisay2010" /&gt;

== Tenure as Construction and Development Corporation of the Philippines (CDCP) Chairman ==
Cuenca's chairmanship of Construction &amp; Development Corporation of the Philippines (CDCP) began in 1967, and lasted until 1983.&lt;ref name="Dalisay2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Manapat1991" /&gt; It was during this period that Cuenca acquired much of his wealth, properties, and companies.&lt;ref name="Manapat1991" /&gt; Between these years, CDCP experienced a rapid rise of profits, mainly through what critics called "bloated" government contracts.&lt;ref name="Manapat1991" /&gt; These profits then suddenly plummeted, due to accumulation of government debts and unnecessary expenses.&lt;ref name="Manapat1991" /&gt;{{Explain|date=July 2018}}

=== CDCP Projects ===
Cuenca's company was involved with many projects, which were constructed at the behest of Ferdinand Marcos and his wife, [[Imelda Marcos]].&lt;ref name="Manapat1991" /&gt;  These included the Manila North and South Luzon Expressways, the [[San Juanico Bridge]], Imelda Marcos' Manila Bay Reclamation Project, and the [[Manila Light Rail Transit System|Light Rail Transit (LRT)]].

====Manila North and South Luzon Expressways====
The first major government contract CDCP was awarded were for the construction of Manila North and South Luzon Expressways.&lt;ref name="Manapat1991" /&gt; By the end of 1968, the first phase of the Manila North Luzon Expressway (NLEX) was open to the public, the road measuring 28 kilometers towards Guiginto Bulacan from Balintawak. In the same year of 1968, construction for the Manila South Luzon Expressway (SLEX) began. The initial 16-kilometer stretch from Nichols to Alabang was finished by 1970.&lt;ref name="Dalisay2010" /&gt;

These contracts also allowed CDCP to gain back their expenditures and/or capital &lt;ref name="Dalisay2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Manapat1991" /&gt; by collecting toll fees for a decade, "starting from 1968 or until it accumulated $6.1 million, whichever came first."&lt;ref name="Manapat1991" /&gt; CDCP, however, requested that the duration be extended, as well the amount increased, justifying that their cost of operations had also inflated, and that they were held responsible "not only to maintain the highways but also to improve and 'expand' them."&lt;ref name="Manapat1991" /&gt; Although a TRB report showed evidence that CDCP has amassed $25.6 million already in one year alone from 1976–77, TRB approved their request and extended the duration to thirty years. Presidential Decrees (PD) 1112 and 1113 in 1977 also imposed an increase in toll rates, forcing the public to pay steep fees that would primarily benefit CDCP and Cuenca's pocket.&lt;ref name="Manapat1991" /&gt; During a 1975 toll hike, buses boycotted the NLEX and SLEX roads. The Marcos administration retaliated by releasing a PD that closed service roads for buses, which then had no choice to pass through the expressways.&lt;ref name="Manapat1991" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MartialLawMuseumCronyism" /&gt;

==== San Juanico Bridge ====

In 1974, the Marcos administration and the CDCP tapped Japanese Official Development Assistance (ODA) loans&lt;ref name="IBON2005"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/68191461 |title=Fifty years of Japan ODA : a critical review for ODA reform : Reality of Aid Asia-Pacific 2005 report. |date=2005 |publisher=IBON Books |isbn=9710325523 |location=Manila |oclc=68191461}}&lt;/ref&gt; to build the [[San Juanico Bridge]], which crossed the [[San Juanico Strait]] and connected the two then-underdeveloped islands of Leyte and Samar.&lt;ref name="RoelLandingin20080213"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://pcij.org/stories/7-in-10-oda-projects-fail-to-deliver-touted-benefits |title=7 in 10 ODA projects fail to deliver touted benefits |last=Landingin |first=Roel R. |date=2008-02-13 |website=[[Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism]] Website |language=en-US |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091012170044/http://pcij.org/stories/7-in-10-oda-projects-fail-to-deliver-touted-benefits |archive-date=2009-10-12 |dead-url=No |access-date=2018-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a total length of {{convert|2.16|km|mi|sp=us}}, it remains the longest bridge spanning a body of seawater in the Philippines.

It was touted as President [[Ferdinand Marcos]]' "birthday gift" to his wife [[Imelda Marcos|Imelda]],and &lt;ref name="LyzaSabornido20140917"/&gt; it was one of the high-visibility foreign-loan projects initiated by Marcos during the run-up to the 1969 Presidential election campaign.&lt;ref name="Manapat1991"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Some are smarter than others : the history of Marcos' crony capitalism |last=Ricardo. |first=Manapat, |date=1991 |publisher=Aletheia Publications |isbn=9719128704 |location=New York |oclc=28428684}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Completed four years later, it was inaugurated on July 2, 1973 - Imelda Marcos' birthday.&lt;ref name="LyzaSabornido20140917"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://faq.ph/10-facts-you-should-know-about-san-juanico-bridge-in-samar-and-leyte/|title=10 Facts You Should Know about San Juanico Bridge in Samar and Leyte|last=Sabornido|first=Lyza|date=17 September 2014|website=|publisher=FAQ.ph|access-date=26 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon its completion, economists and public works engineers tagged it as a white elephant which was "''constructed several decades too soon''",&lt;ref name="RoelLandingin20080213"/&gt; because its average daily traffic (ADT) was too low to justify the cost of its construction.&lt;ref name="RoelLandingin20080213"/&gt; As a result, its construction has been associated with what has been called the Marcoses' "''[[edifice complex]]''".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://newslab.philstar.com/31-years-of-amnesia/building-spree|title=Edifice complex {{!}} 31 years of amnesia|last=Afinidad-Bernardo|first=Deni Rose M.|date=|website=Philstar|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MartialLawMuseumEdificeComplex"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://martiallawmuseum.ph/magaral/edifice-complex-building-on-the-backs-of-the-filipino-people/ |title=Edifice Complex: Building on the Backs of the Filipino People |work=Martial Law Museum |access-date=2018-05-01 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the decades after the Marcoses administration, economic activity in Samar and Leyte has finally caught up with the bridge's intended function, and it has become an iconic tourist attraction acknowledged as "''part of the identity of people in Samar and Leyte.''"&lt;ref name="MartialLawMuseumEdificeComplex" /&gt;

==== Manila Bay Reclamation ====
CDCP, again at Imelda's behest sought out a land reclamation project in Manila Bay. They were to construct an artificial 240-hectare white beach behind the [[Cultural Center of the Philippines]]. The rationale of the project was to create a 'Cannes' vibe for the  international visitors of the Manila Film Festival. The white sand was quarried from the cities of Mariveles and Cavite. This area is now known to be the [[Bay City, Metro Manila|Manila Bay Freeport Zone]]. Also at Imelda's command, CDCP and other companies worked to create a "huge complex of native-style pavilions"&lt;ref name="Manapat1991"/&gt; for representatives of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development in their 1979 conference in Manila.&lt;ref name="Manapat1991" /&gt; The complex became a ghost town throughout the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Manapat1991" /&gt;{{Update inline|reason=Has it been repurposed since the source cited was published in 1991?|?=yes|date=July 2018}}

==== Light Rail Transit ====
Another project of the CDCP was the [[Manila Light Rail Transit System|Light Rail Transit (LRT)]], this time partly financed by a $40 million loan from the Belgian government.&lt;ref name="Manapat1991"/&gt; A study of the World Bank in 1977 challenged the intentions of the project, stating that Manila needed a street-level transport system, not a 'high-flyer'.&lt;ref name="Manapat1991"/&gt;{{elucidate|date=July 2018}} A street-level transport system would also cost much cheaper, with only a $8.1 million estimate, compared to the $278 million over-all cost for the LRT.&lt;ref name="Manapat1991"/&gt; Despite these skepticisms, Marcos permitted Cuenca to begin construction in October 1981.&lt;ref name="Manapat1991"/&gt;

==== Other projects ====
Other projects the CDCP under Cuenca handled were the [[Pantabangan Dam]], and the [[Candaba Viaduct]].&lt;ref name=phreader/&gt;

==== Turnover of Chairmanship to Roberto Ongpin ====
Cuenca eventually{{when|date=July 2018}} invited Roberto Ongpin to take his place as CDCP chairman,&lt;ref name="AmandoDoronila20100929" /&gt; although Cuenca kept his position as president, and "7% ownership" of the firm.&lt;ref name="Manapat1991" /&gt;

== 1987 PCGG Case ==
On July 24, 1987, the Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG) filed a case whose respondents included Cuenca and his son Roberto,  Imelda Marcos, Roberto Ongpin, former Philippine National Bank president Panfilo O. Domingo, Development Bank of the Philippines officer Don Ferry, and eleven others,&lt;ref name="ChadDeGuzman20180619"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2018/06/19/Supreme-Court-ill-gotten-wealth-PCGG-Ferdinand-Marcos-cronies.html) |title=SC junks PCGG's ill-gotten wealth claims vs. Marcos, cronies |last=DeGuzman |first=Chad |date=2018-06-19 |work=CNN Philippines}}&lt;/ref&gt; claiming that the respondents had engaged in “schemes, devices or stratagems” to acquire ill-gotten wealth.&lt;ref name="”ABSCBN20100809”"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/nation/08/09/10/gov%E2%80%99t-loses-p51-billion-claim-against-marcos-cronies |title=Gov’t loses P51 billion claim against Marcos cronies |date=2010-10-09 |work=ABS CBN News |access-date=2018-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On August 5, 2010, the Sandiganbayan dismissed the case after throwing out 60 of the 100 documentary exhibits presented by the PCGG at the trial because they were photocopies, rather than original copies of the documents.&lt;ref name="”ABSCBN20100809”" /&gt;   The 27-page decision penned by Sandiganbayan Associate Justice Alex L. Quiroz,&lt;ref name="”ABSCBN20100809”" /&gt;  asserted that “since the due execution and authenticity of said photocopied documents had not been proved, the same were inadmissible in evidence. Further, the documents in question were rendered inadmissible as they were only photocopies.&lt;ref name="”ABSCBN20100809”" /&gt;”

In June 2018, the Philippine Supreme Court’s First Division&lt;ref name="ChadDeGuzman20180619" /&gt;  dismissed the complaint of the PCGG against the 2010 Sandiganbayan ruling, stating that the Supreme Court was not able to review the evidence in order to rule on the PCGG’s complaint.&lt;ref name="ChadDeGuzman20180619" /&gt;   The 28-page decision penned by Supreme Court Associate Justice [[Noel Tijam]] &lt;ref name="ChadDeGuzman20180619" /&gt;  said that:&lt;ref name="ChadDeGuzman20180619" /&gt; "In order to determine the veracity of the Republic's main contention that it has established a prima facie case against respondents through its documentary and testimonial evidence, a reassessment and reexamination of the evidence is necessary&lt;nowiki&gt;[….]&lt;/nowiki&gt; Unfortunately, the limited and discretionary judicial review allowed under Rule 45 does not envision a re-evaluation of the sufficiency of the evidence upon which respondent court's action was predicated.&lt;ref name="ChadDeGuzman20180619" /&gt; "

The PCGG released a press statement reacting to the decision, saying "Although the complaint was filed by the PCGG more than 31 years ago, and the Supreme Court decision was a mere affirmation of the Sandiganbayan ruling 8 years ago, the present officials of PCGG will still exhaust all possible legal remedies to pursue the case and to protect government interest.” &lt;ref name="ChadDeGuzman20180619" /&gt;

== 2010 biography ==
In the 2000s, Cuenca sought out authors Jose Dalisay Jr. and Antonette Reyes to write his biography, which was eventually published in September 2010 under the title "''Builder of Bridges: the Rudy Cuenca Story''".&lt;ref name="AmandoDoronila20100927" /&gt;

Journalist [[Amando Doronila]], who had himself been one of the first critics arrested when Marcos proclaimed martial law in 1972, noted that "''the book is the first time a Marcos crony or a senior functionary has written about his role in the Marcos hierarchy,''" adding that in the book, "''Rodolfo Cuenca who admits to being a Marcos crony, reveals for the first time an insider’s view of the heightening rivalry among power blocs within the Marcos inner circle as the dictator’s health started to deteriorate in 1983... The book reveals the corruption and the corrosive tensions among the Marcos’ Palace elite that contributed to its downfall during the last three years of the dictatorship.''&lt;ref name="AmandoDoronila20100927" /&gt;"

'''Science policy''' is concerned with the allocation of resources for the conduct of science towards the goal of best serving the public interest.  Topics include the [[funding of science]], the careers of scientists, and the translation of scientific discoveries into [[technological innovation]] to promote [[commercial product development]], [[Competition (companies)|competitiveness]], [[economic growth]] and [[economic development]].  Science policy focuses on knowledge production and role of knowledge networks, collaborations and the complex distributions of expertise, equipment and know-how. Understanding the processes and organizational context of generating novel and innovative science and engineering ideas is a core concern of science policy. Science policy topics include [[weapons development]], [[health care]] and [[environmental monitoring]].

Science policy thus deals with the entire domain of issues that involve science.  A large and complex web of factors influences the development of science and
engineering that includes government science policy makers, private firms (including both national and multi-national firms), social
movements, media, non-governmental organizations, universities, and other research institutions. In addition, science policy is increasingly international as defined by the global operations of firms and research institutions as well as by the collaborative networks of non-governmental
organizations and of the nature of scientific inquiry itself. 

==History==
{{main|History of science policy}}

[[State (polity)|State]] [[policy]] has influenced the funding of [[public works]] and science for thousands of years, dating at least from the time of the [[Mohists]], who inspired the study of logic during the period of the [[Hundred Schools of Thought]], and the study of defensive fortifications during the [[Warring States period]] in China. General levies of labor and grain were collected to fund great public works in China, including the accumulation of grain for distribution in times of famine,&lt;ref&gt;Francesca Bray (1984), ''[[Science and Civilisation in China]]'' '''VI.2''' '''''Agriculture'''''&lt;/ref&gt; for the building of levees to control flooding by the great rivers of China, for the building of canals and locks to connect rivers of China, some of which flowed in opposite directions to each other,&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Needham]], ''[[Science and Civilisation in China]]''&lt;/ref&gt; and for  the building of bridges across these rivers. These projects required a [[civil service]], the [[Scholar-bureaucrats|scholars]], some of whom demonstrated great mastery of [[hydraulics]].

In Italy, Galileo noted that individual taxation of minute amounts could fund large sums to the State, which could then fund his research on the trajectory of cannonballs, noting that "each individual soldier was being paid from coin collected by a general tax of pennies and farthings, while even a million of gold would not suffice to pay the entire army."&lt;ref&gt;[[Galileo]] (1638) [http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=753&amp;chapter=109891&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27 Two New Sciences], Salviati, first day of the dialogs&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Great Britain]], [[Lord Chancellor]] [[Sir Francis Bacon]] had a formative effect on science policy with his identification of "experiments of .. light, more penetrating into nature [than what others know]",&lt;ref&gt;[[Sir Francis Bacon]] (1624). ''[[New Atlantis]]''&lt;/ref&gt; which today we call the [[crucial experiment]].  Governmental approval of [[the Royal Society]] recognized a [[scientific community]] which exists to this day. British prizes for research spurred the development of an accurate, portable [[Marine chronometer|chronometer]], which directly enabled reliable navigation and sailing on the high seas, and also funded [[Charles Babbage|Babbage]]'s computer.

The professionalization of science, begun in the nineteenth century, was partly enabled by the creation of scientific organizations such as the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]], the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute]], and State funding of universities of their respective nations. In the United States, a member of the National Academy of Sciences can sponsor a Direct Submission for publication in the ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pnas.org/site/misc/iforc.shtml#submission PNAS Submission Guidelines]&lt;/ref&gt; ''PNAS'' serves as a channel to recognize research of importance to at least one member of the National Academy of Sciences.

Public policy can directly affect the funding of [[capital equipment]], intellectual infrastructure for industrial research, by providing tax incentives to those organizations who fund research. [[Vannevar Bush]], director of the office of scientific research and development for the U.S. government in July 1945, wrote "Science is a proper concern of government"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nsf.gov/od/lpa/nsf50/vbush1945.htm Vannevar Bush (July 1945), "Science, the Endless Frontier"]&lt;/ref&gt;  Vannevar Bush directed the forerunner of the [[National Science Foundation]], and his writings directly inspired researchers to invent the [[hyperlink]] and the [[computer mouse]].  The [[DARPA]] initiative to support computing was the impetus for the [[Internet Protocol]] stack. In the same way that scientific consortiums like [[CERN]] for [[high-energy physics]] have a commitment to public knowledge, access to this public knowledge in physics led directly to CERN's sponsorship of development of the [[World Wide Web]] and standard Internet access for all.

==Philosophies of science policy==
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2010}}

===Basic versus applied research===
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2014}}

The programs that are funded are often divided into four basic categories: [[basic research]], [[applied research]], [[Research and development|development]], and facilities and equipment.&lt;ref name="AAASpresentation"&gt;{{cite web|last=Clemins|first=Patrick|title=R&amp;D in the President's FY 2011 Budget|url=http://www.aaas.org/spp/rd/presentations/|accessdate=20 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed (lead)|date=December 2014}}  [[Translational research]] is a newer concept that seeks to bridge the gap between basic science and practical applications.

Basic science attempts to stimulate breakthroughs. Breakthroughs often lead to an explosion of new technologies and approaches.  Once the basic result is developed, it is widely published; however conversion into a practical product is left for the free market.  However, many governments have developed risk-taking research and development organizations to take basic theoretical research over the edge into practical [[engineering]].  In the [[United States|U.S.]], this function is performed by [[DARPA]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

On the other hand, technology development is a policy in which engineering, the application of science, is supported rather than basic science.  The emphasis is usually given to projects that increase important strategic or commercial engineering knowledge.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}  The most extreme{{dubious|date=December 2014}} success story is doubtless the [[Manhattan Project]] that developed [[nuclear weapon]]s.  Another remarkable success story was the "X-vehicle" studies that gave the US a lasting lead in aerospace technologies.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

These exemplify two disparate approaches: The Manhattan Project was huge, and spent unblinkingly on the most risky alternative approaches.  The project members believed that failure would result in their enslavement or destruction by [[Nazi Germany]].  Each X-project built an aircraft whose only purpose was to develop a particular technology.  The plan was to build a few cheap aircraft of each type, fly a test series, often to the destruction of an aircraft, and never design an aircraft for a practical mission.  The only mission was technology development.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

A number of high-profile technology developments have failed.  The US Space Shuttle failed to meet its cost or flight schedule goals.  Most observers explain the project as over constrained: the cost goals too aggressive, the technology and mission too underpowered and undefined.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

The Japanese [[fifth generation computer systems project]] met every technological goal, but failed to produce commercially important [[artificial intelligence]].  Many observers{{Who|date=December 2014}} believe that the Japanese tried to force engineering beyond available science by brute investment.  Half the amount spent on basic research rather might have produced ten times the result.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

=== Utilitarian versus monumental science policy ===
[[Utilitarianism|Utilitarian]] policies prioritize scientific projects that significantly reduce [[suffering]] for larger numbers of people.  This approach would mainly consider the numbers of people that can be helped by a research policy.  Research is more likely to be supported when it costs less and has greater benefits.  Utilitarian research often pursues incremental improvements rather than dramatic advancements in knowledge, or break-through solutions, which are more commercially viable/feasible.

In contrast, monumental science is a policy in which science is supported for the sake of a greater understanding of the universe, rather than for specific short-term practical goals.  This designation covers both large projects, often with large facilities, and smaller research that does not have obvious practical applications and are often overlooked.  While these projects may not always have obvious practical outcomes, they provide education of future scientists, and advancement of scientific knowledge of lasting worth about the basic building blocks of science.&lt;ref name=Vuong2018&gt;{{cite journal|title=The (ir)rational consideration of the cost of science in transition economies|journal=Nature Human Behaviour|volume=2|issue=1|pages=5|date=January 1, 2018|doi=10.1038/s41562-017-0281-4|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-017-0281-4|accessdate=January 2, 2018|last1=Vuong|first1=Quan-Hoang}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Practical outcomes do result from many of these "monumental" science programs.  Sometimes these practical outcomes are foreseeable and sometimes they are not.  A classic example of a monumental science program focused towards a practical outcome is the [[Manhattan project]].  An example of a monumental science program that produces unexpected practical outcome is the [[laser]].  Coherent light, the principle behind lasing, was first predicted by Einstein in 1916, but not created until 1954 by Charles H. Townes with the [[maser]].  The breakthrough with the maser led to the creation of the laser in 1960 by Theodore Maiman.  The delay between the theory of coherent light and the production of the laser was partially due to the assumption that it would be of no practical use.&lt;ref&gt;Suplee, Curt (1999) ''Physics In The 20th Century'' Harry N. Abrams Inc, 58-63.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scholastic conservation===
This policy approach prioritizes efficiently teaching all available science to those who can use it, rather than investing in new science.  In particular, the goal is not to ''lose'' any existing knowledge, and to find new practical ways to apply the available knowledge.  The classic success stories of this method occurred in the 19th century U.S. land-grant universities, which established a strong tradition of research in practical agricultural and engineering methods.  More recently, the [[Green Revolution]] prevented mass famine over the last thirty years.  The focus, unsurprisingly, is usually on developing a robust curriculum and inexpensive practical methods to meet local needs.

== Science policy by country ==

Most developed countries usually have a specific national body overseeing national science (including technology and innovation) policy. In the case developing countries many follow the same fashion.  Many governments of [[developed country|developed countries]] provide considerable funds (primarily to universities) for scientific research (in fields such as [[physics]] and [[geology]]) as well as social science research (in fields such as [[economics]] and [[history]]). Much of this is not intended to provide concrete results that may be commercialisable, although research in scientific fields may lead to results that have such potential. Most university research is aimed at gaining publication in [[peer review]]ed [[academic journal]]s.

A funding body is an organisation that provides [[research funding]] in the form of [[research grant]]s or [[scholarship]]s.  Research councils are the funding bodies that are government-funded agencies engaged in the support of research in different disciplines and postgraduate funding.  Funding from research councils is typically competitive. As a general rule, more funding is available in science and engineering disciplines than in the arts and social sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.prospects.ac.uk/cms/ShowPage/Home_page/Funding_my_further_study/Public_funding_bodies/p!ejclk | title = Public funding bodies | work = [[Graduate Prospects]] | accessdate = 2007-02-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
In [[Australia]], the two main research councils are the [[Australian Research Council]] and the [[National Health and Medical Research Council]].

===Canada===
In [[Canada]], the three main research councils ("Tri-Council") are the [[Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council]] (SSHRC) the [[Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council]] (NSERC) and the [[Canadian Institutes of Health Research]] (CIHR). Additional research funding agencies include the [[Canada Foundation for Innovation]], [[Genome Canada]], [[Sustainable Development Technology Canada]] and several Tri-Council supported [[Networks of Centres of Excellence]]. [http://www.nce.gc.ca/]

===Brazil===

In Brazil, two important research agencies are the [[National Council for Scientific and Technological Development]] (CNPq, Portuguese: Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico), an organization of the Brazilian federal government under the Ministry of Science and Technology, and [[São Paulo Research Foundation]] (FAPESP, Portuguese: Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo), a public foundation located in the state of São Paulo, Brazil [http://www.fapesp.br/en/].

===European Union===
The science policy of the [[European Union]] is carried out through the [[European Research Area]], which is a system that integrates the scientific resources of member nations and acts as a "common market" for research and innovation purpose.  The European Union's executive body, the [[European Commission]], has a [[Directorate-General for Research (European Commission)|Directorate-General for Research]]; which is responsible for the Union's science policy.  In addition, the [[Joint Research Centre]] provides independent scientific and technical advice to the European Commission and Member States of the [[European Union]] (EU) in support of EU policies.&lt;ref name="a1370"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/jrc/index.cfm?id=1370 | title=EU Science Hub - European Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is also the recently established [[European Research Council]], the first European Union [[Funding of science|funding body]] set up to support investigator-driven research.

There are also European science agencies that operate independently of the European Union, such as the [[European Science Foundation]], [[European Space Agency]], and the [[European Higher Education Area]]; which are created by the [[Bologna process]].

On science policy and on the European Research Area is grounded the [[European environmental research and innovation policy]], which addresses global challenges of pivotal importance for the well-being of the European citizens within the context of sustainable development and environmental protection. Research and innovation in Europe is financially supported by the programme [[Horizon 2020]], which is also open to participation worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;See Horizon 2020 – the EU's new research and innovation programme http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-13-1085_en.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
{{main|Research Councils UK}}

In the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Haldane principle]], that decisions about what to spend research funds on should be made by researchers rather than politicians, is still influential in research policy. There are several university departments with a focus on science policy, such as the [[Science Policy Research Unit]]. There are seven grant-awarding [[Research Councils UK|Research Councils]]:
* [[Arts and Humanities Research Council]] (AHRC)
* [[Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council]] (BBSRC)
* [[Economic and Social Research Council]] (ESRC)
* [[Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council]] (EPSRC)
* [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]] (MRC)
* [[Natural Environment Research Council]] (NERC)
* [[Science and Technology Facilities Council]] (STFC)

===United States===
{{main|Science policy of the United States}}

The [[United States]] has a long history of government support specially for science and technology.  Science policy in the United States is the responsibility of many organizations throughout the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]].  Much of the large-scale policy is made through the legislative [[United States budget process|budget process]] of enacting the yearly [[United States federal budget|federal budget]].  Further decisions are made by the various federal agencies which spend the funds allocated by Congress, either on in-house research or by granting funds to outside organizations and researchers.

Research funding agencies in the United States are spread among many different departments, which include:
* Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ([[DARPA]])
* [[United States Department of Energy]] Office of Science
* [[National Institutes of Health]]: biomedical research
* [[National Science Foundation]]: fundamental research and education in all the non-medical fields of science and engineering.
* [[Office of Naval Research]]

'''Selective disclosure''' is a situation when a publicly traded company discloses material information to a single person, or a limited group of people or investors, as opposed to disclosing the information to all investors at the same time.

[[Material information]] is roughly defined as information that would cause a reasonable investor to make a buy or sell decision.

A problem with selective disclosure that the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) sought to eliminate with [[Regulation Fair Disclosure]](a.k.a. [[Regulation FD]] or [[Reg FD]]), is that it creates an uneven playing field for investors, allowing some investors to profit from material [[market moving information]] before others.

An example of a selective disclosure could go as follows: A company insider tells a small group of Wall Street analysts that the company is going to beat current analyst consensus estimates for earnings per share.  If this is the first time the company disclosed such [[earnings guidance|guidance]], and the guidance wasn't simultaneously disseminated to all investors via a press release or publicized webcast, then the disclosure would constitute selective disclosure.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23878">'''Sergio Tasselli''' is an [[Italy|Italian]]-[[Argentina|Argentinian]] businessman. He is the head of one of the largest business groups in Argentina and has been called “the most successful businessman of recent times” in that country.&lt;ref name=indy&gt;{{cite web| title =SERGIO TASSELLI: KIRCHNER TIENE SU YABRAN| work =Argentina indymedia| url =http://argentina.indymedia.org/news/2004/09/225558_comment.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2004, he has been running “twenty companies operating in the generation and distribution of power, metallurgy ([[Materfer]], Electroaleaciones, Aceros Zapla), petrochemicals (Bermúdez), agricultural machinery (Agrinar), and the food sector (Bruning Mill).” His offices are on Avenida Cerviño, in the [[Buenos Aires]] neighborhood of Palermo.&lt;ref name=lanac&gt;{{cite web| title =Tasselli quiere dejar el negocio ferroviario| work =La Nacion| date =Jul 2, 2004| url =http://www.lanacion.com.ar/614967-tasselli-quiere-dejar-el-negocio-ferroviario}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tasselli  has been described as having benefited greatly from the program of privatization during the [[Carlos Menem|Menem]] presidency and then having profited under the subsequent presidencies of [[Nestor Kirchner]] and [[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner]].&lt;ref name=elcom&gt;{{cite web| title =Tasselli tendría en Suiza una cuenta de EDEFOR por 5,4 millones de dólares| work =El Comercial| date =Aug 17, 2013| url =http://www.elcomercial.com.ar/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=117522:investigan-por-lavado-al-ex-dueno-de-edefor-y-le-congelan-sus-cuentas&amp;catid=54&amp;Itemid=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Argentinian media routinely describe him as a “K businessman,” or Kirchner businessman – that is, someone who has profited from his connections to the Kirchner regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Estas son las pruebas que pueden complicar a Sergio Tasselli| work =El Sur Hoy| url =http://www.elsurhoy.com.ar/home/2602?tmpl=component&amp;print=1&amp;page=0}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''La Nación'' stated in 2004 that here is “always a pall of suspicion” hanging over his businesses.&lt;ref name=lanac/&gt; His alleged mismanagement of several branches of the national railway has been faulted for deadly train accidents, and a mining accident that killed 14 people in 2004 in the province of Santa Cruz was attributed to his alleged mismanagement of the mines.

He has been investigated, prosecuted, and fined for many irregularities in the conduct of his businesses, but has not yet been imprisoned.

==Early life and education==
Tasselli was born on November 10, 1944. He was born in Italy and moved to Argentina as a small child.&lt;ref name=lanac2&gt;{{cite web| title =A diferencia de Yabrán, yo no hago negocios con el Estado| work =La Nacion| date =Jul 14, 2003| url =http://www.lanacion.com.ar/511284-a-diferencia-de-yabran-yo-no-hago-negocios-con-el-estado}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a young man, he was reportedly a member of the [[Montoneros]], a left-wing guerrilla and subversive group of the 1960s and 70s.&lt;ref name=indy/&gt;

==Career==
According to ''La Nación'', Tasselli built a group of businesses “practically from the ground up” with help from his political contacts, most of them members of the circle surrounding President Menem circle.&lt;ref name=lanac2/&gt; He has been described as having built his empire by taking control of privatized companies and buying factories in auctions. According to ''La Nación'', Tasselli “became a specialist in closing deals with the state.”&lt;ref name=lanac3&gt;{{cite web| last =Sanz| first =Alfredo| title =La primera empresa que volvió de la privatización| work =La Nacion| date =Jun 16, 2004| url =http://www.lanacion.com.ar/610730-la-primera-empresa-que-volvio-de-la-privatizacion}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Indymedia'' describes Tasselli as having been a “front man” for Menem, benefiting from “all the government concessions” during Menem's presidency. “Because of subsidies received from the government,” Indymedia maintains, “Tasselli is the most powerful businessman in Argentina.”&lt;ref name=indy/&gt;

Tasselli's relationship with the Kirchner family reportedly began in 1994, when he was put in charge of the concession of Yacimientos Carboníferos Fiscales.&lt;ref name=indy/&gt; A September 2004 ''Indymedia'' article was headlined “Sergio Tasselli: Kirchner Has His Yabrán,” a reference to [[Alfredo Yabrán]], a businessman who had profited through his intimate connection to the government of Carlos Menem.&lt;ref name=indy/&gt;

Early in his career, he is said to have kept a “low profile.” As of July 2003, he had reportedly never granted an interview and declined to be photographed.&lt;ref name=lanac2/&gt; In that year, ''La Nación'' called him “a new strongman in the business world,” said that “Taccelli is quietly building an economic empire,” and stated that his group of companies was growing “in the shadows.” ''La Nación'' noted that Tasselli's “associates generally do not come from the world of business but from the world of politics, such as former Montoneros leader [[Mario Montoto]].”&lt;ref name=lanac4&gt;{{cite web| last =Sainz| first =Alfredo| title =Tasselli, el grupo que crece en las sombras| work =La Nacion| date =Jul 14, 2003| url =http://www.lanacion.com.ar/511283-tasselli-el-grupo-que-crece-en-las-sombras}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tasselli runs such firms as the Grupo Metropolitano and the electricity companies Edecat (Catamarca) and Edefor (Formosa), but he is not legally listed as the owner or principal shareholder of most of his firms. Instead, the companies are listed variously in the names of his five children and his brother Alberto.&lt;ref name=lanac2/&gt;

He was a principal shareholder of Electromat, which withdrew from the stock market in 2003.&lt;ref name=lanac5&gt;{{cite web| title =Qué pasa| work =La Nacion| date =May 31, 2003| url =http://www.lanacion.com.ar/500189-que-pasa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tasselli's other firms include, or have included, Trainmet SA, Trainmet Servicios SA, Tecnica Industrial SA, Socieded Inmobiliaria del Nuevo Puerto, General Plasticos SA, CES SA, Alta Tension SA, Circum SA, SI GE SA, WLI Servicios SA, Compania Desmonte SA, Trainmet Ciccone Servicios SA, Finca Los Alerces SA, Mic.

===YCRT===
Tasselli took over the Yacimiento Rio Turbio (YCRT) coal mines in Santa Cruz after they were privatized in 1994, and ran them until 2001. YCRT was the first business to be de-privatized under Menem.&lt;ref name=lanac3/&gt; Tasselli reportedly was granted the coal-mining concession at Rio Turbio because he had “become intimate with the Santa Cruz Front for Victory.”&lt;ref name=urg&gt;{{cite web| title =Tasselli, la otra 'bolilla negra' del Frente para la Victoria| work =Urgente 24| date =Feb 25, 2012| url =http://www.urgente24.com/195710-tasselli-la-otra-bolilla-negra-del-frente-para-la-victoria?pagination=show}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the years when he ran YCRT, the Argentinian government paid $22.5 million annually in subsidies for the mines.&lt;ref name=turb&gt;{{cite web| last =Arias| first =Mariela| title =Inversión estatal en la mina de Río Turbio| work =La Nacion| date =Dec 20, 2003| url =http://www.lanacion.com.ar/557021-inversion-estatal-en-la-mina-de-rio-turbio}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tasselli's control of the mines ended in a scandal that saw the mines re-nationalized in 2001.&lt;ref name=lanac4/&gt;

In that year, miner Raul Wanzo, acting on behalf of the miners' union, sued Tasselli for mismanagement, corruption, smuggling, and other charges. During Tasselli's tenure, the number of miners had reportedly dropped by more than three quarters, safety measures deteriorated, and production declined. Also, when he took over the mines, he replaced contractors with his own firms. “Tasselli's management of Rio Turbio was worse than a war,” charged ''IndyMedia''. “They stole everything they could steal.”&lt;ref name=indy/&gt; YCRT became “the first company to return to the state after being privatized during the decade the government of Carlos Menem.”&lt;ref name=turb/&gt; The episode has been described as a “failed privatization.”&lt;ref name=lanac6&gt;{{cite web| last =Sainz| first =Alfredo| title =Parmalat vende su filial local a un empresario argentino| work =La Nacion| date =Sep 25, 2004| url =http://www.lanacion.com.ar/639438-parmalat-vende-su-filial-local-a-un-empresario-argentino}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When an explosion and collapse took place at one of the mines in 2004, killing 14 miners, Tasselli was accused of having caused it.&lt;ref name=opi&gt;{{cite web| title =Sergio Tasselli y Cirigliano: paradigma de los subsidios con igual final. Hoy ampliaron pruebas en contra del ex concesionario de YCRT| work =Opi Santa Cruz| url =http://opisantacruz.com.ar/home/2012/02/24/sergio-tasselli-y-cirigliano-paradigma-de-los-subsidios-con-igual-final-hoy-ampliaron-pruebas-en-contra-del-ex-concesionario-de-ycrt/13666}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miners' union spokespeople attributed the mine disaster “directly to the lack of investment” in YCRT by Tasselli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =INVESTIGAN MÁS VINCULACIONES DE SERGIO TASSELLI| work =Mining Press| date =Jun 29, 2004| url =http://www.miningpress.com.ar/nota/3546/investigan-mas-vinculaciones-de-sergio-tasselli}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A lawyer for the miners' union, Safrani Bernardino, directly accused Kirchner and Tasselli of responsibility for the 14 miners' deaths. Bernardino said that the workers had died as a consequence of “apathy” on the part of Tasselli and others who had made them “work as if they were animals.” 
The miners were, Bernardino said, the victims of a “coincidence of interests and politics.” According to charges, he had not invested “a single penny of the $ 22.5 million received per year in subsidies” in new machinery, necessary safety measures, or in the opening of new mines.&lt;ref name=indy/&gt; He was also accused of stealing company machinery, trucks, trains, and tools, and of importing machinery and vehicles tax-free through YCRT and then using them in other Tasselli-run companies. It was further charged that YCRF had lost money on suspicious payments to creditor firms that were mainly owned by him.&lt;ref name=indy/&gt;

In May 2010, Federal Judge Sergio Torres summoned Tasselli to testify for possible crimes involving the alleged depletion of the Rio Turbio coal mine that occurred while he was running YCRT between 1994 and 2002. Tasselli was accused of diverting state assets to benefit his own companies, employing accounting maneuvers to evade taxes, violating various commitments, allowing rolling stock to be destroyed, among other charges. Torres cited a long list of YCRT assets that had been diverted to other firms. It was argued that these actions could well be responsible for the deadly mine accident of June 14, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =SERGIO TASSELLI, ANTE LA JUSTICIA| work =Diario Show| date =May 20, 2010| url =http://www.diarioshow.com/notas/2010/05/20/33612-sergio-tasselli-ante-la-justicia.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tasselli was accused by Torres of emptying the coal company, mismanagement, smuggling, diverting state funds, engaging in accounting maneuvers to evade taxes, failing to return movable and immovable state property placed in his charge, allowing locomotives and rolling stock to fall into disrepair, and violating production commitments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Opinan que Sergio Tasselli tendría que ser procesado| work =Tiempo Sur| date =Jun 7, 2010| url =http://www.tiemposur.com.ar/nota/13350-opinan-que-sergio-tasselli-tendra-que-ser-procesad}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 23, 2011, Torres ordered Tasselli to stand trial and ordered a seizing of his assets until the state could recover 45 million pesos that he was accused of having defrauded from YCRT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =PROCESARON AL EMPRESARIO SERGIO TASSELLI | work =La Tribuna 69| date =Dec 6, 2010| url =http://www.latribuna69.com.ar/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1848:procesaron-al-empresario-sergio-tasselli&amp;catid=45:medio-ambiente&amp;Itemid=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 7, 2012, Wanzo filed with the Court of Appeals for recovery of assets that Tasselli had allegedly stolen from YCRT.&lt;ref name=opi/&gt; Wanzo charged that Tasselli had “killed people with corruption” by “diverting subsidies provided to him by the State” to his own personal accounts.&lt;ref name=urg/&gt;  Wanzo stated that Tasselli had followed the same approach in Metropolitan, Rock-San Martin, Edecat SA, Parmalat SA, Acepar, and other companies under his control, taking money from government subsidies “at the cost of death and destruction of jobs.”&lt;ref name=opi/&gt; In mid March 2014, at the request of prosecutor Federico Delgado, Torres summoned Tasselli for questioning on March 26, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Farella| first =Sergio| title =Citan a indagatoria al empresario Taselli por millonaria estafa en el manejo de Río Turbio| work =infobae| url =http://www.infobae.com/2014/03/13/1549796-citan-indagatoria-al-empresario-taselli-millonaria-estafa-el-manejo-rio-turbio}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Edecat===
His electrical firm in Catamarca, Edecat, was allegedly involved in 2003 in what La Nacion described as a $10 million “scam.”&lt;ref name=lanac4/&gt;

===Altos Hornos de Zapla===
The Tasselli group also ran the firm Altos Hornos de Zapla, which was privatized under Menem. Senator Gerardo Morales announced in January 2004 that the national government would cease dealings with the firm, citing an alleged breach of contract.&lt;ref name=lanac5/&gt;

===Metropolitano===
Tasselli began his involvement in the railway sector in 2000.&lt;ref name=lanac/&gt; His firm Metropolitano is the concessionaire for the railway lines Belgrano south and San Martin. It was also the concessionaire for the Roca line, which was returned to the state “in the midst of allegations of deficiencies in the services provided.”&lt;ref name=lanac3/&gt; As of 2004, Metropolitano was billing $650 million a year and employed 12,000 people.&lt;ref name=lanac/&gt; In July of that year, he was engaged in a “full legal dispute with the government over the decision to rescind the contract to operate the San Martin branch” as well. During that dispute, he said that he was being “persecuted” by Transportation Secretary Ricardo Jaime.&lt;ref name=lanac/&gt;

During the 1990s and 2000s, Tasselli was the defendant in many court cases involving his mismanagement of the rail services.&lt;ref name=juic&gt;{{cite web| last =Esposito| first =Nestor| title =Sergio Taselli, a un paso del juicio oral| work =Tiempo Argentino| date =May 21, 2012| url =http://tiempo.infonews.com/nota/116462/sergio-taselli-a-un-paso-del-juicio-oral}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2002, the Duhalde government passed a measure under which Tasselli, as owner of Metropolitano, was given 400,000 pesos a day in government subsidies while, according to widespread complaints, not investing any of that money in the railroad. Critics of his management of the railway assets have long objected to what they describe as a suspect relationship between Tasselli and the Minister of Planning and Public Investment, Julio De Vido. One point of contention was his dismissal of what was described as “the effective staff of former Ferrocarriles Argentinos,” which had provided the railway lines with maintenance and security, and hired in its place an allegedly less efficient company called Industrial Technical SA, which is owned by the Tasselli group. Moreover, Tasselli was accused of stealing machinery, tools, lathes, and other equipment from the railroads that ended up “as if by magic” at other Tasselli firms. “Tasselli would never have carried out such theft without the complicity of the government,” maintained IndyMedia.&lt;ref name=indy/&gt;

A March 2014 report by the Senate General Audit Office stated that 120 people had died and 1500 sustained wounds on Argentinian trains between 2002 and 2012. The crashes mainly involved trains run by Tasselli's firm Metropolitano.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Cabot| first =Diego| title =El ferrocarril dejó 120 muertos y 1500 heridos entre 2002 y 2012| work =La Nacion| date =Mar 14, 2014| url =http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1672007-el-ferrocarril-dejo-120-muertos-y-1500-heridos-entre-2002-y-2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parmalat===
In September 2004, Tasselli bought the Argentinian subsidiary of the Italian dairy group Parmalat.&lt;ref name=lanac6/&gt; He acquired his stake in Parmalat Argentina through his firm Molinos Bruning. Tasselli reportedly bought Parmalat Argentina with a token payment of one euro and, as a result of the purchase, acquired debts of over 200 million pesos.&lt;ref name=pag12&gt;{{cite web| last =Dellatorre| first =Raul| title =Parmalat continúa abriendo polémicas| url =http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/economia/2-45178.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ten days after taking control of Parmalat Argentina, in order to restructure the firm, whose name they had changed to Compañía Láctea del Sur, Tasselli's group filed for bankruptcy on behalf of the firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Sainz| first =Alfredo| title =Tasselli presentó en concurso a Parmalat| work =La Nacion| date =Dec 29, 2004| url =http://www.lanacion.com.ar/666995-tasselli-presento-en-concurso-a-parmalat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Centrales Térmicas Patagónicas===
Among the many firms run by Tasselli is the electrical firm Centrales Térmicas Patagónicas, which owns electrical generators in Puerto Madryn, Comodoro Rivadavia, and Pico Truncado, filed for reorganization in June 2009. At the time it was owned 17% by Sergio Tasselli, 17% by IATE (a firm owned by Tasselli and his brother Alberto), 17% by Luz y Fuerza, 25.88% by Chubut, 13.12% by the Argentinian government, and 10% by its employees.&lt;ref name=lanac5/&gt;

===Sorrento===
Tasselli was the principal shareholder in the Santa Fe electrical firm Sorrento as of August 2009. In that month it was reported that he had dismissed more than 60 employees of Sorrento. His action was denounced by the workers' union, which charged that he planned to close the plant and sell it off. He denied that he had such plans and said that it was legally impossible to sell the plant because of contractual requirements.&lt;ref name=lanac5/&gt;

==Legal activity==

===Lawsuit with brother===
It was reported on May 21, 2012, that Tasselli was “on the verge of a public trial for allegedly defrauding his own brother, Alberto Tasselli, of almost $2 million” and that the Court of Criminal Appeal had just rejected a request filed by Tasselli's lawyer, Mariano Di Meglio, to dismiss a March 8 decision to prosecute him for fraud. Tasselli was accused by his brother of “abusing his powers of attorney” in 1993 “to divert to his or others' advantage sums of money belonging to the company IATE SA” in  a matter involving another firm, NEP SA.&lt;ref name=juic/&gt;

===Accusations of financial irregularities===
In March 2001 Tasselli, as proxy for IATE SA, reportedly transferred $1,150,000 in company funds to an account in his name at Bank Boston NA in Montevideo. Some months later, he transferred $800,000.&lt;ref name=juic/&gt;

Tasselli said in August 2005 that [[Paraguay]]an steelmaker Acepar, of which he was president, was up to date on payments to that country's government. His statement followed a request by President [[Nicanor Duarte]] that Acepar pay its total debt to Paraguay of some $24 million from its 1997 privatization. Nicolás Caballero, general secretary of Acepar's union Sitrasa, said there was evidence that Acepar had not invested sufficiently in the steel mill. “The machinery is in a dreadful state, they are neither buying supplies to guarantee normal plant operation nor is there a clear sales policy from the management,” he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Beltran| first =Harvey| title =Acepar says state payments up to date| work =BN americas| date =Aug 22, 2005| url =http://www.bnamericas.com/news/metals/Acepar_says_state_payments_up_to_date}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tasselli's firm Molinos Bruning, based in Santa Fe, was sued in provincial federal court by the AFIP for tax evasion. Complaints about irregularities in the firm led to three searches, performed at two locations in Santa Fe (San Jorge and Rosario) and one in Tucumán.&lt;ref name=pag12/&gt;

A September 2009 report stated that private flights by Nestor and Cristina Kirchner had cost an average of $100,000 a month, and that one of the planes on which they had flown was a Lear Jet owned by Tasselli's son Mariano.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Dorfman| first =Pablo| title =Presidencia gasta US$ 100.000 por mes en taxis aéreos privados| work =Clarin| url =http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2009/09/12/um/m-01997474.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Argentinian government fined Edesur $280,000 for breach of contract.&lt;ref name=indy/&gt;

La Federación Económica de Catamarca (FEC) said that the provincial government should terminate a concession contract with Edecat SA because of lack of investment, poor service, and overcharging. Edecat, however, ignored resolutions by the FEC and by the provincial government calling on it to improve its performance.&lt;ref name=indy/&gt;

In 2011 Tasselli began to run the dairy firm Gándara, an enterprise that ended in bankruptcy.&lt;ref name=juic/&gt;

Tasselli was accused in 2013 of becoming involved in the steel mill Aceros del Paraguay (Acepar) in an illegal manner. According to a Paraguayan newspaper, since the Paraguayan government was the main shareholder of Aceros, and since the firm owed the government money, Tasselli could not legally become its majority shareholder, which he did, without paying the debt, which he did not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Acusan a Tasselli de entrar 'ilegalmente' a la principa lsiderúrgica de Paraguay| work =Cronista| url =http://www.cronista.com/negocios/Acusan-a-Tasselli-de-entrar-ilegalmente-a-la-principa-lsiderurgica-de-Paraguay-20130214-0041.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was reported on August 17, 2013, that Tasselli had a [[Swiss bank account]] for the Edefor firm in the amount of $5.4 million, and that he was being investigated for money laundering by the [[Finance Intelligence Unit Suisse]]. He reportedly held several Swiss accounts in his own name. Among the irregular transactions investigated by the Swiss was a transfer of $7.4 million from an account in his name n ABN Amro Bank to another Dutch account. Also he transferred almost $20 million from the [[Royal Bank of Canada]] to an account in [[Geneva]] in his name. Also, he deposited $3 million in various Swiss banks. The suspicious deposits took place between August 2003 and April 2009. Swiss authorities asked Tasselli to explain the transactions but as of August 7 had received no reply. Consequently, Swiss federal prosecutor Frederic Schaller requested cooperation in the matter from Argentina's Ministry of Justice.&lt;ref name=elcom/&gt;

Gustavo Correa, president of Vetorial Brazil, denied in August 2014 that his firm, which had taken control of Aceros del Paraguay (Acepar) had any relationship with Tasselli, who was accused of having left the company's coffers empty until it reached the brink of bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Presidente de Vetorial SA niega vinculación con Sergio Tasselli| work =Ultima Hora| date =Aug 12, 2014| url =http://www.ultimahora.com/presidente-vetorial-sa-niega-vinculacion-sergio-tasselli-n819956.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===ATE slogan===
In 2000 the union of Argentinian government workers, ATE, popularized a slogan: “Tasselli Out!”&lt;ref name=indy/&gt;

'''The Special Olympics''' is the world's largest sports organization for children and adults with [[intellectual disabilities]], providing year-round training and competitions to 5 million athletes and Unified Sports partners in 172 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/press/releases/SpecialOlympicsat50 |title=Smithsonian Highlights Special Olympics History and Athletes |date=July 6, 2018 |website=National Museum of American History |language=en |access-date=2018-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Special Olympics competitions are held every day, all around the world—including local, national and regional competitions, adding up to more than 100,000 events a year.&lt;ref name="Reach"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://media.specialolympics.org/resources/reports/reach-reports/2016_ReachReport_Final_4Pager.pdf |title=2016 Reach Report |website=Special Olympics}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the [[International Paralympic Committee]], the Special  Olympics organization is recognized by the [[International Olympic Committee]]; however, unlike the Paralympic Games, Special Olympics World Games are not held in the same year or in conjunction with the Olympic Games.

The [[Special Olympics World Games]] is a major event put on by the Special Olympics. The World Games alternate between summer and winter games, in two-year cycles, recurring every fourth year. The first games were held on July 20, 1968 in [[Chicago]], Illinois, with about 1000 athletes from the U.S. and Canada. International participation expanded in subsequent games. In 2003, the first summer games held outside the United States were in [[Dublin]], Ireland with 7000 athletes from 150 countries. The most recent World Summer Games were held in [[Los Angeles]], California (The largest event in LA since the 1984 [[Olympic Games]]), from July 25, 2015 to August 2, 2015. This was the first time that the Special Olympics were part of [[ESPN]] daily coverage. The next World Summer Games will be held in [[Abu Dhabi]], United Arab Emirates in March 2019. These will be the first Special Olympics World Games to be held in the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.specialolympics.org/Games/2019_World_Summer_Games.aspx|title=World Games in MENA for the First Time|website=Special Olympics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first World Winter Games were held in 1977 in [[Steamboat Springs, Colorado|Steamboat Springs]], Colorado. [[Austria]] hosted the first Winter Games outside the United States in 1993.  The most recent Special Olympics World Winter Games were held in [[Graz]], [[Schladming]] and [[Ramsau am Dachstein|Ramsau]], Austria from March 14, 2017 to March 25, 2017 (see also [[2017 Special Olympics World Winter Games]]).  During the World Winter Games of 2013 in [[Pyeongchang County|Pyeongchang]], [[South Korea]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.2013sopoc.org/hb/en |title=Main page |work=2013sopoc.org |publisher= |accessdate=February 4, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120817070502/http://www.2013sopoc.org/hb/en |archivedate=August 17, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the first Special Olympics Global Development Summit was held on "Ending the Cycle of Poverty and Exclusion for People with Intellectual Disabilities," gathering government officials, activists and business leaders from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.specialolympics.org/Press/2013/Global_Leaders_Convene_in_PyeongChang,_Korea_Participate_in_Groundbreaking_Special_Olympics_Global_Development_Summit.aspx |title=Global Leaders Convene in PyeongChang, Korea Participate in Groundbreaking Special Olympics Global Development Summit |publisher=Special Olympics |date=2013-01-30 |accessdate=2014-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In June 1962, [[Eunice Kennedy Shriver]] started a day camp called [[Eunice Kennedy Shriver|Camp Shriver]] for children with intellectual disabilities at her home in [[Potomac, Maryland]].&lt;ref name="so-history"/&gt; She started this camp because of concern about children with intellectual disabilities having very little opportunity to participate in athletic events. Using Camp Shriver as an example, Eunice Kennedy Shriver, who was head of the [[Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr. Foundation]] and part of President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s Panel on Mental Retardation, promoted the concept of involvement in physical activity and other opportunities for people with intellectual disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jfklibrary.org/JFK/JFK-Legacy/JFK-and-Disability.aspx|title=JFK and Disabilities - John F. Kennedy Presidential Library &amp; Museum|website=www.jfklibrary.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Camp Shriver became an annual event, and the Kennedy Foundation (of which Eunice became director in 1957) gave grants to universities, recreation departments and community centers to hold similar camps.

It was also in the early 1960s that Eunice Kennedy Shriver wrote an article in the Saturday Evening Post, revealing that her sister [[Rosemary Kennedy|Rosemary]], also President John F. Kennedy's sister, was born with intellectual disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/2009/08/13/history/post-perspective/eunice-kennedy-shriver-19212009.html|title=Eunice Kennedy Shriver 1921-2009 - The Saturday Evening Post|first=The Saturday Evening Post|last=Society|website=www.saturdayeveningpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This frank article about the President's family was seen as a "watershed" in changing public attitudes toward people with intellectual disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;Kessler, p. 246&lt;/ref&gt; Shiver's inspiration for her work came from Rosemary's disability, and provided her with an overall vision that people with intellectual disabilities could compete and unify the public that come from all different situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.goodnet.org/articles/10-facts-about-special-olympics-list-1|title=10 Facts about the Special Olympics [LIST] - Goodnet|work=Goodnet|access-date=2017-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has often been said that Rosemary's disability was Eunice's inspiration to form Special Olympics (as the movement came to be called), but she told ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 1995 that that was not exactly the case. "The games should not focus on one individual," she said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Johnson, Kirk|title=Reaching the Retarded: An Old Kennedy Mission|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/23/nyregion/reaching-the-retarded-an-old-kennedy-mission.html|work=The New York Times|date=June 23, 1995|accessdate=July 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, in 1958, Dr. James N. Oliver of England was conducting pioneering research, including a ground-breaking study showing that physical exercise and activities for children with intellectual disabilities had positive effects that also carried over into the classroom ("The Effects of Physical Conditioning Exercises and Activities on the Mental Characteristics of Educationally Sub-Normal Boys, British Journal of Educational Psychology, XXVIII, June 1958).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psychsource.bps.org.uk/details/journalArticle/3584061/THE-EFFECT-OF-PHYSICAL-CONDITIONING-EXERCISES-AND-ACTIVITIES-ON-THE-MENTAL-CHARA.html|title=THE EFFECT OF PHYSICAL CONDITIONING EXERCISES AND ACTIVITIES ON THE MENTAL CHARACTERISTICS OF EDUCATIONALLY SUB‐NORMAL BOYS - PsychSource|website=psychsource.bps.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Oliver would later (1964) serve as consultant to Camp Shriver, the forerunner to Special Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.specialolympics.org/Sections/What_We_Do/Out_of_the_Shadows__Events_Leading_to_the_Founding_of_Special_Olympics.aspx|title=Special Olympics: Out of the Shadows: Events Leading to the Founding of Special Olympics|website=www.specialolympics.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote box |bgcolor=#F3F0FD |salign=right| quote =Let me win but if I cannot win, let me be brave in the attempt|source=– Special Olympics athlete oath&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JEe1DgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA397&amp;dq=special+olympics+athletes+oath&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjvtdr19avcAhUB3IMKHdErDx84ChDoAQhJMAY#v=onepage&amp;q=special%2520olympics%2520athletes%2520oath&amp;f=false |title=Oxford Textbook of Children's Sport and Exercise Medicine |last=Armstrong |first=Neil |last2=Mechelen |first2=Willem van |date=2017 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780191074981 |page=397|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The 1964 research of Dr. [[Frank Hayden]], a Canadian physical education professor from London, Ontario, had shown that persons with intellectual disabilities can and should participate in physical exercise. Moreover, he believed that the benefits of such activity would be seen in all areas of the athletes' lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kch.uiuc.edu/Alumni/Hayden.aspx|title=Welcome to Kinesiology &amp; Community Health - Kinesiology &amp; Community Health|website=www.kch.uiuc.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; And so, with the help of a local school that offered space in its gym, one of the first organised sports programs [[floor hockey]] for individuals with intellectual disabilities became available in the fall of 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ottawa.specialolympicsontario.ca/about-us|title=About Us - Special Olympics Ontario - Greater Ottawa|website=ottawa.specialolympicsontario.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the mid-1960s, he developed an idea for national games, and his work brought him to the attention of the Kennedy Foundation. He shared his ideas for national games, while taking a teaching sabbatical and working for the foundation.&lt;ref name=Moczulski&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/article-how-the-special-olympics-were-born/ |title=How the Special Olympics were born |last=Moczulski |first=J.P.  |date=July 16, 2018 |work=Globe and Mail |access-date=2018-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Special Olympics games were held in July 1968 at [[Soldier Field]] in Chicago. About 1,000 athletes from the U.S. and Canada took part in the one-day event, which was a joint venture by the Kennedy Foundation and the [[Chicago Park District]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.specialolympics.org/Sections/What_We_Do/Out_of_the_Shadows__Events_Leading_to_the_Founding_of_Special_Olympics.aspx |title=Out of the Shadows: Events Leading to the Founding of |publisher=Special Olympics |date= |accessdate=2014-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Anne McGlone Burke]], then a physical education teacher with the Chicago Park District,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.niu.edu/1998/ip980517.html |title=Feature Article |publisher=Lib.niu.edu |date=1968-07-20 |accessdate=2014-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; began with the idea for a one-time, city-wide, Olympic-style athletic competition for people with special needs. Burke approached the Kennedy Foundation in 1967 to fund the event. Eunice, in turn, encouraged her to expand the idea beyond the city and the foundation provided a grant of $25,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fotonique.com/limerick-collection/what-to-see-what-to-do-limerick/the-peoples-park-limerick/limerick-special-olympics-2014/|title=SPECIAL OLYMPICS 2014|website=www.fotonique.com|access-date=2017-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When Burke had approached another charity for funding, she was told, "You should be ashamed of yourself putting these kinds of kids on display".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/one-of-historys-most-transformative-human-rights-movements-turns-50/2018/07/15/21c00c6c-8081-11e8-b660-4d0f9f0351f1_story.html |title=One of history's most transformative human rights movements turns 50 |last=McCallum  |first=Jack |date=July 15 |work=Washington Post |access-date=2018-07-21 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advisory committee to the Chicago Special Olympics included Dr. William Freeberg, Southern Illinois University; Dr. Hayden of the Kennedy Foundation; Dr. Arthur Peavy; Burke, William McFetridge, and Stephen Kelly of the Chicago Park District; and Olympic decathlon champion [[Rafer Johnson]]. Eunice Kennedy Shriver was honorary chair. At the July 1968 games, Shriver announced the formation of Special Olympics and that more games would be held every two years as a "Biennial International Special Olympics".&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;  Hayden served as the games executive director through 1972, and then in international development for the games.&lt;ref name=Moczulski/&gt;

In 1971, The [[U.S. Olympic Committee]] gave the Special Olympics official approval to use the name "Olympics".&lt;ref name="so-history"/&gt; [[France]] sent the first athletes from outside North America to the second games held in 1970.  The third games in 1972 saw 10 nations send athletes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.specialolympics.org/Sections/What_We_Do/History/History_1970s.aspx |title=A Joyful New Movement Gains Momentum |website=Special Olympics |language=en |access-date=2018-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first Special Olympics World Winter Games were held in February 1977 in Steamboat Springs, Colorado, U.S.&lt;ref name="so-history"/&gt;  The [[United Nations]] declared 1986, the year of the Special Olympics.&lt;ref name="specialolympics.org"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.specialolympics.org/Sections/What_We_Do/History/History_1980s.aspx |title=Recognition and Growth Around the World |website=Special Olympics |language=en |access-date=2018-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1988, the Special Olympics was officially recognized by the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC).&lt;ref name="so-history"/&gt;  The first World Games held outside the U.S., were the winter games of 1993 in Salzburg and [[Schladming]], Austria.  The Austrian president was the first head of state to personally open the games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.specialolympics.org/Sections/What_We_Do/History/History_1990s.aspx |title=Pushing for Inclusion and Improved Health for People with ID |website=Special Olympics |language=en |access-date=2018-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, [[Healthy Athletes]] became an official Special Olympics initiative, offering health information and screenings to Special Olympics athletes worldwide.&lt;ref name="so-history"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mary Davis,[http://www.herald.ie/opinion/mary-davis-how-health-checks-on-our-special-athletes-are-saving-lives-2612833.html], "How Health Checks on our Special Athletes are saving lives", Evening Herald, Thursday, April 7th 2011&lt;/ref&gt; By 2010, the Healthy Athletes program had given free health screenings and treatment to more than 1 million people with intellectual disabilities.

[[File:2003 Special Olympics Opening Crowd.JPG|left|thumb|The crowd at the [[2003 Special Olympics World Summer Games]] Opening Ceremonies in [[Croke Park]], [[Dublin]], Ireland.]]
In 2003 the first Special Olympics World Summer Games to be held outside of the United States took place in [[Dublin]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. Approximately 7,000 athletes from 150 countries competed over 18 disciplines. The [[Dublin]] games were also the first to have their own opening and closing ceremonies broadcast live. President of Ireland [[Mary McAleese]] performed the ceremonial duties.  The 2003 games dramatically changed the perceptions and attitudes of international society regarding the abilities and limitations of people with intellectual disabilities. The opening ceremony of the [[2003 Special Olympics World Summer Games|2003 Games]] has been described by President McAleese as "a time when Ireland was at its superb best".&lt;ref&gt;Fiona Brady, [http://www.activecitizenship.ie/index.asp?locID=12&amp;docID=47 Taskforce ON citizenship] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071118182202/http://www.activecitizenship.ie/index.asp?locID=12&amp;docID=47 |date=2007-11-18 }}, "Her bridges built, McAleese reflects on a decade in office", Irish Independent, November 3, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 30, 2004, President [[George W. Bush]] signed into law the "Special Olympics Sport and Empowerment Act," Public Law 108-406.  The bill authorized funding for its Healthy Athletes, Education, and Worldwide Expansion programs.&lt;ref name="sosea"/&gt;  Co-sponsored by Representatives [[Roy Blunt]] (R-MO), and [[Steny Hoyer]] (D-MD), and Senators [[Rick Santorum]] (R-PA) and [[Harry Reid]] (D-NV), the bills were passed by unanimous consent in both chambers.  In July 2006, the first [[Special Olympics USA]] Games were held at [[Iowa State University]].  Teams from all 50 states and the [[District of Columbia]] participated.&lt;ref name="so-usng"/&gt;

In May 2016, [[Mary Davis (activist)|Mary Davis]] of Dublin, Ireland was named Chief Executive Officer. She is the first CEO from outside the U.S. in the organization's history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/other-sports/outstanding-achievement-award-for-mary-davis-entirely-fitting-1.3329312 |title=Outstanding Achievement award for Mary Davis entirely fitting |last=O'Riordan |first=Ian |date=December 16, 2017 |work=The Irish Times |access-date=2018-07-16 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbols==
The Special Olympics [[logo]] is based on the sculpture "Joy and Happiness to All the Children of the World" by [[Zurab Tsereteli]] which was a gift to [[The College at Brockport, State University of New York|SUNY Brockport]] when the university hosted the Special Olympics in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.brockport.edu/about/archives/special_olympics/gift.html|title=A Special Gift: The College at Brockport|website=www.brockport.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hdl.handle.net/1951/36531|title=Special Olympics Statue, ca. 1979|last=Unknown|first=College Photographer|date=13 February 2007|website=SUNY Digital Repository|archive-url=https://dspace.sunyconnect.suny.edu|archive-date=2007-02-13|dead-url=|access-date=5 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The logo has gone through several changes in its lifetime. The "stick figure" is an abstract but humanistic form designed to convey the impression of movement and activity.  The logo is a symbol of growth, confidence and joy among children and adults with disabilities who are learning coordination, mastering skills, participating in competitions and preparing themselves for richer, more productive lives.

In 2018, the Chicago Park District erected the {{convert|30|foot}} "Eternal Flame of Hope" in honor of the Special Olympics.  The sculpture by [[Richard Hunt (sculptor)|Richard Hunt]] stands in a plaza next to Soldier Field, where the first games were held 50 years earlier in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://abc7chicago.com/sports/new-chicago-sculpture-honors-special-olympics-50th-anniversary/3782871/ |title=New Chicago sculpture honors Special Olympics' 50th anniversary |last=Holmes |first=Evelyn |date=2018-07-18 |work=ABC7 Chicago |access-date=2018-07-19 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.specialolympics.org/Press/2018/Break_Ground_on_Eternal_Flame_of_Hope.aspx |title=To Celebrate the 50th Anniversary Year, Special Olympics and the Chicago Park District  Break Ground on Eternal Flame of Hope, a Permanent Monument to Convey the Hope for Inclusion of People with Intellectual Disabilities |date=March 2, 2018 |language=en |access-date=2018-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Flame of Hope (Special Olympics)|Flame of Hope]] is the name given to the torch that is carried to and lit at Special Olympics games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.disabled-world.com/sports/special-olympics/flame-of-hope.php |title=Special Olympics Flame of Hope |date=2017-12-24 |website=Disabled World |language=en-US |access-date=2018-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Participation==
Special Olympics programs are available for athletes free of charge. More than 5.7 million athletes and Unified Sports partners are involved in Special Olympics sports training and competition in 172 countries.&lt;ref name="ABILITY Magazine"&gt;{{cite web|last = Cooper|first = Chet|title = Timothy Shriver – Special Olympics|url = http://abilitymagazine.com/Special-Olympics-Shriver.html|publisher = ABILITY Magazine|accessdate = 18 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization offers year-round training and competition in 32 Olympic-style summer and winter sports.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/photo/2011/07/2011-special-olympics-summer-games/100104/ |title=2011 Special Olympics Summer Games |work=The Atlantic Photo |accessdate=|date = July 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People with intellectual disabilities are encouraged to join Special Olympics for the physical activity, which helps lower the rate of cardiovascular disease and obesity, among other health benefits. Also, they gain many emotional and psychological benefits, including self-confidence, social competence, building greater athletic skills and higher self-esteem.&lt;ref name="The Driving Force"/&gt; Exercise has also been shown to be related to a decrease in anxiety levels amongst people with intellectual disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carraro|first=Attilio|last2=Gobbi|first2=Erica|date=2012-07-01|title=Effects of an exercise programme on anxiety in adults with intellectual disabilities|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S089142221200042X|journal=Research in Developmental Disabilities|volume=33|issue=4|pages=1221–1226|doi=10.1016/j.ridd.2012.02.014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To qualify for the special olympics, a person must be at least 8 years old and identified by an agency or professional as having one of the following conditions: intellectual disabilities, cognitive delays as measured by formal assessment, or significant learning or vocational problems due to cognitive delay that require or have required specially designed instruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.specialolympics.org/Common/Frequently-Asked-Questions.aspx|title=Special Olympics: Frequently-Asked-Questions|website=Special Olympics|language=en|access-date=2017-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; For young people with and without intellectual disabilities ages 2–7, Special Olympics has a Young Athletes program—an inclusive sport and play program with a focus on activities that are important to mental and physical growth. Children engage in games and activities that develop motor skills and hand-eye coordination. Parents say their children in Young Athletes also develop better social skills. The confidence boost makes it easier for them to play and talk with other children on the playground and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.specialolympics.org/young_athletes.aspx |title=Young Athletes |publisher=Special Olympics |date=2014-05-06 |accessdate=2014-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study by the Center for Social Development and Education (University of Massachusetts, Boston) found that the activities also had the effect of helping children with intellectual disabilities learn routines and approaches to learning, along with how to follow rules and directions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:xXCaCGRpyVgJ:www.dec-sped.org/uploads/docs/conference/2012%2520Handouts/RES622%2520Young%2520Athletes%2520Intervention.pdf+%22center+for+social+development+and+education%22+%22special+olympics%22+%22young+athletes%22&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEEShJeMIE5Bz08XSzCotEX17n7oAbE5iZSE8zmF7v-_2J0B3gifUNkgkZChkCLo79OZdlbu7sSsxq4shblS9GcWLrOfWHDpSUlunNl_-hdywUT2YVNUAYtNhC30CvEjvDN6d0I5eL&amp;sig=AHIEtbTk4fdv8kGX6GH-fy6M8ECv8YibAw |title=Google Drive Viewer |publisher=Docs.google.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Families can also get involved with the Special Olympics experience. Family members support their athletes to the best of their ability, which may involve attending or volunteering at the events. By being involved they can boost their athlete's self-esteem and will be looked at as a constant source of encouragement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.specialolympics.org/families.aspx |title=Our Families |work=specialolympics.org |publisher= |accessdate=February 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Volunteers and supporters are an integral part of Special Olympics—and millions of people around the world are committed to its programs. Some are sponsors or donors. Many others are coaches, event volunteers and fans.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.specialolympics.org/Sections/Who_We_Are/Our_Volunteers.aspx |title=Volunteer for Special Olympics |work=specialolympics.org |publisher= |accessdate=February 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coaches help the athletes be the best they can be regardless of ability—or disability. Special Olympics trains coaches through the Coaching Excellence program, which includes partnering with sports organizations. Special Olympics volunteers are introduced to lifetime friendships and great rewards.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

There are many events in which families and volunteers participate, but the biggest event is the [[Law Enforcement Torch Run]], which involves police chiefs, police officers, secret service, FBI agents, military police, sheriffs, state troopers, prison guards, and other law enforcement personnel assembling to raise awareness and funds for Special Olympics. Ahead of a Special Olympics competition, [[law enforcement]] officers carry the torch in intervals along a planned route covering most of the state or country to the site of the opening [[ceremonies]] of the chapter or Special Olympics World Summer or Winter Games. Then they pass the torch to a Special Olympics athlete and together they run up to the cauldron and light it, signifying the beginning of the games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.disabled-world.com/sports/special-olympics/flame-of-hope.php |title=Special Olympics Flame of Hope |date=2017-12-24 |website=Disabled World |language=en-US |access-date=2018-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Special Olympics athlete's oath, which was first introduced by Eunice Kennedy Shriver at the inaugural Special Olympics international games in Chicago in 1968,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://learningenglish.voanews.com/content/eunice-kennedy-shriver-1921-2009-she-changed-the-world-for-people-with-mental-disabilities-128100168/115313.html |title=Eunice Kennedy Shriver, 1921-2009: She Changed the World for People with Mental Disabilities |publisher=Learningenglish.voanews.com |date=2011-08-19 |accessdate=2014-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; is "Let me win. But if I cannot win, let me be brave in the attempt." The origin of the oath came from Herbert J. Kramer, then Public Relations Advisor to the Kennedy Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bisd.us/specialservices/oath.htm |title=Origin of the Athlete Oath|accessdate=2016-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.somd.org/Volunteer/Volunteer_General_Orientation_-_September_2012.pdf |title=Volunteer General Orientation – Special Olympics Maryland |accessdate=2016-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports offered==
In 1968, track and field, swimming and floor hockey were the first three official sports offered by Special Olympics. As in the Olympics, events are introduced in training and then added to the competitive schedule, and from there the list of sports and events continued to grow.

Special Olympics has more than 30 Olympic-type individual and team sports that provide meaningful training and competition opportunities for people with intellectual disabilities. As of 2016, these are:&lt;ref name=SO-Our-Sports&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.specialolympics.org/Sections/Sports-and-Games/Sports_and_Games.aspx | title = Our Sports | website = Special Olympics | publisher = The Joseph P.

Other sports and sports-related programs include the Motor Activity Training Program&lt;ref name=SO-Our-Sports/&gt; and Beach Volleyball. Availability of sports can depend on location and season.

A key difference between Special Olympics competitions and those of other sports organizations is that athletes of all ability levels are encouraged to participate. Competitions are structured so that athletes compete with other athletes of similar ability in equitable divisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://resources.specialolympics.org/Topics/Sports/Divisioning.aspx |title=Special Olympics: Divisioning |publisher=Resources.specialolympics.org |date=2014-05-06 |accessdate=2014-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; An athlete's ability is the primary factor in divisioning Special Olympics competitions. The ability of an athlete or team is determined by an entry score from a prior competition or the result of a seeding round or preliminary event at the competition itself. Other factors that are significant in establishing competitive divisions are age and gender.

At competitions, medals are awarded to the first, second and third-place winners in each event, and ribbons are awarded to athletes who finish in fourth through eighth place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.specialolympics.org/specialo.org/Special_/English/Coach/Coaching/Basics_o/Special_.htm#principles |title=Special Olympics: Sports and Games |publisher=Sports.specialolympics.org |date=2014-05-06 |accessdate=2014-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unified Sports==
In recent years, Special Olympics has pioneered the concept of Unified Sports, bringing together athletes with and without intellectual disabilities as teammates.&lt;ref name="specialolympics1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.specialolympics.org/unified-sports.aspx |title=Unified Sports |publisher=Special Olympics |date= |accessdate=2014-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic concept is that training together and playing together can create a path to friendship and understanding. The program has expanded beyond the U.S. and North America: more than 1.4 million people worldwide now take part in Special Olympics Unified Sports.&lt;ref name="Reach"/&gt; The goal is to break down stereotypes about people with intellectual disabilities and promote unity.&lt;ref name="specialolympics1"/&gt;

A recent study of Special Olympics Unified Sports in Serbia, Poland, Ukraine, Germany and Hungary documented the program's benefits, including the effect of changing attitudes toward people with intellectual disabilities. As one Unified Sports partner said, "I am ashamed to say that I used to laugh at these people (people with intellectual disabilities), now I will tell anybody to stop laughing if I see it and I will stand up for people if I can."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.specialolympics.org/uploadedFiles/LandingPage/WhatWeDo/Final%20Report%20Unified%20Sports10%20Sept%202010.pdf|title = 'Unified Gives Us a Chance'|date = |accessdate = June 4, 2017|website = specialolympics.org|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other evaluations have also shown Unified Sports to be successful in building self-esteem and confidence in people with intellectual disabilities and also as a way to improve understanding and acceptance of people with intellectual disabilities among their non-disabled peers.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

The Special Olympics Europe Eurasia Regional Research centre is based at the [[Ulster University|University of Ulster Jordanstown]] and is jointly led by Professor Roy McConkey and Professor [[David Hassan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.specialolympics.org/Stories/General/Special_Olympics_leads_the_way_in_the_field_of_research.aspx |title=Special Olympics leads the way in the field of research |last=Menke |first=Sabine  |date=December 1, 2014 |website=Special Olympics |language=en |access-date=2018-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of their 50th anniversary, the Special Olympics created the first Unified Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.specialolympics.org/50th/FirstEverUnifiedCup.aspx |title=Countdown to the Special Olympics Unified Cup |website=Special Olympics |language=en |access-date=2018-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first competition is a [[soccer]] tournament with 440 athletes from 24 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://chicago.cbslocal.com/2018/07/17/special-olympics-50th-anniversary-2/ |title=400 Athletes Converge On Chicago For Special Olympics Anniversary |last=Victory |first=Lauren |date=2018-07-17 |work=CBS  |access-date=2018-07-19 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://abc7chicago.com/sports/special-olympics-unified-cup-kicks-off-tuesday/3771888/ |title=Special Olympics Unified Cup kicks off Tuesday |last=Varon |first=Roz |date=2018-07-16 |work=ABC7 Chicago |access-date=2018-07-19 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Healthy Athletes==
As Special Olympics began to grow, staffers and volunteers began to notice that athletes—children and adults with intellectual disabilities—also had many untreated health problems. In 1997, Special Olympics began an initiative called Healthy Athletes, which offers health screenings to athletes in need.&lt;ref name="specialolympics2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.specialolympics.org/healthy_athletes.aspx |title=Health Programs |publisher=Special Olympics |date=2014-05-06 |accessdate=2014-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Healthy Athletes currently offers health screenings in seven areas: Fit Feet (podiatry), FUNfitness (physical therapy), Health Promotion (better health and well-being), Healthy Hearing (audiology), MedFest (sports physical exam), Opening Eyes (vision) and Special Smiles (dentistry). Screenings educate athletes on health and also identify problems that may need additional follow-up. For example, the FUNfitness Program assess flexibility, strength, balance, and aerobic fitness of the athlete. Following the screen, the physical therapist would provide instructions on how to optimize their physical fitness in the areas screened.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.specialolympics.org/Sections/What_We_Do/Healthy_Athletes/Healthy_Athletes_FUNfitness.aspx|title=Special Olympics: Healthy Athletes FUNfitness|website=www.specialolympics.org|language=en|access-date=2017-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the Healthy Athletes program began, Special Olympics has become the largest global public health organization dedicated to serving people with intellectual disabilities. So far, more than 1.9 million Healthy Athletes screenings have been conducted for people with intellectual disabilities all around the world.&lt;ref name="specialolympics2" /&gt;

The Special Olympics health initiative has attracted high-profile partners, including the Hear the World Foundation, which screened more than 1,000 athletes during the most recent World Winter Games in Korea; more than 200 of them were found to have hearing loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hear-the-world.com/en/how-we-help/projects-worldwide/projects-2013/special-olympics.html |title=Special Olympics |publisher=Hear The World |date= |accessdate=2014-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.specialolympics.org/Stories/Healthy_Athletes/Forms/Healthy_Athletes_Stories.aspx |title=Healthy Athletes Stories |publisher=Special Olympics |date= |accessdate=2014-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the Special Olympics Healthy Communities initiative launched in eight countries—Kazakhstan, Malawi, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, Romania, South Africa and Thailand, as well as six U.S. states. The goal is to improve the health and well-being of people with intellectual disabilities and allow them to reach their full potential.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;

==Criticism==
Scholar Keith Storey summarized common objections in a 2004 article in ''Journal of Disability Policy Studies''. One criticism directed at the organization pertains to the role that corporate sponsors play in it, which critics feel has led to degrading [[paternalism]] toward athletic ability. While corporate fundraising makes the games possible, critics argue, it provides good public relations for the sponsors, but does not result in integration of people with disabilities into the workforce at those companies. People with disabilities are also not widely represented on the Special Olympics' board of directors, as only two members have disabilities. This has been criticized as a double-standard that reflects poorly on the [[disability rights movement]] where people with disabilities control the service delivery system rather than relying on people without disabilities.&lt;ref name="Storey"&gt;{{cite journal|last = Storey|first = Keith|title = The Case Against the Special Olympics|journal = Journal of Disability Policy Studies|year = 2004|volume = 15|issue = 1|pages = 35–42|url = http://dps.sagepub.com/content/15/1/35.full.pdf+html|accessdate = 9 November 2011|doi = 10.1177/10442073040150010601}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thomas Ellsworth Martin''' (January 18, 1893{{spaced ndash}}June 27, 1971) was a [[United States Representative]] and [[United States Senate|Senator]] from [[Iowa]]. Martin, a Republican, served in Congress for 22 consecutive years, from January 1939 to January 1961.

Born in [[Melrose, Iowa]], he attended the public schools and graduated from the [[State University of Iowa]] (in 1916) and from its [[University of Iowa College of Law|College of Law]] (in 1927). He received his [[LL.M.]] from [[Columbia Law School]] in 1928 and was a sales analyst and accountant for a rubber company in [[Akron, Ohio]], and [[Dallas, Texas]], in 1916 and 1917. During the [[First World War]] he served as a first lieutenant with the Thirty-fifth Infantry, [[United States Army]], from 1917 to 1919.  After the war, he continued work in the rubber industry, then became an assistant professor of [[military science]] and tactics at the [[University of Iowa]] from 1921 to 1923. He was admitted to the Iowa [[bar (law)|bar]] in 1927 and commenced practice in [[Iowa City]], of which he served as city solicitor from 1933 to 1935 and mayor from 1935 to 1937.

In 1938, Martin was elected as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] to the [[U.S. House of Representatives]], serving [[Iowa's 1st congressional district]]. He was re-elected to the House seven consecutive times, serving from January 3, 1939, to January 3, 1955.

In 1954, instead of running again for the House, Martin ran for the U.S. Senate.  He defeated incumbent senator [[Guy M. Gillette]], who was then completing his second full term in the Senate. For the first time since 1924, both of Iowa's senators, and all of its representatives, were Republicans.  Martin served from January 3, 1955, to January 3, 1961. He retired after one term, moving to [[Seattle, Washington]], where he died in June 1971. He was buried in [[Willamette National Cemetery]], [[Portland, Oregon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/8143870/thomas-ellsworth-martin |title=Thomas Ellsworth Martin (1893–1971) |publisher=Find A Grave |accessdate=11 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

L.''', was a founder of [[Gulf Oil]].

==Biography==
Born in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] on June 1, 1868, to [[James Ross Mellon]], eldest son of Judge [[Thomas Mellon]], and Rachel Larimer Mellon, daughter of railroad and land baron [[William Larimer Jr.]] He spent part of his childhood in the [[Western United States|West]] with his uncle [[Andrew W. Mellon|Andrew Mellon]], who deeply influenced him. In the 1880s he developed an interest in the burgeoning [[petroleum industry]] in [[Pennsylvania]], but his nascent oil company was bought out by [[John D. Rockefeller]]'s [[Standard Oil]] in 1895.

When oil was discovered in [[Spindletop]], [[Texas]], in 1901, the Mellon family invested in the well. When the well began to decline in 1902, W.L. was dispatched to investigate, and took on a progressively larger role in management. In January 1907 he established the Gulf Oil Corporation, which proceeded to build a pipeline from [[Oklahoma]] to [[Port Arthur, Texas]] and was shipping Oklahoma crude oil to port by September. It expanded steadily thereafter, becoming one of the largest oil companies in the [[United States]].

He later became active in [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] politics, and served as chairman of the [[Republican State Committee of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania Republican Party]] from 1926 to 1928.

In 1949 Mellon established the graduate school of industrial administration at the [[Carnegie Institute of Technology]] in Pittsburgh, which is today the [[David A. Tepper School of Business]] at [[Carnegie Mellon University]]. He died in October of that year at the age of 81 and was interred in [[Homewood Cemetery]].

===Personal life===
Mellon married Mary Hill Taylor, they had four children: [[Rachel Mellon Walton]], Margaret Mellon Hitchcock, [[William Larimer Mellon Jr.]], and Matthew Mellon I.

[[File:Workfare.jpg|thumb|right|344px|Activists dressed like to 19th century-prison inmates demonstrating against workfare, comparing it to 19th century-prison conditions with penal labour, October 2011.]]

In the United Kingdom, "'''workfare'''" refers to government [[workfare]] policies whereby individuals must undertake work in return for their benefit payments or risk losing them. Workfare policies are politically controversial. Supporters claim that such policies help people move off welfare and into employment (see [[Workfare]]) whereas critics argue that they are analogous to [[slavery]] or [[indentured servitude]] and counterproductive in decreasing unemployment.

==History==

Although actual "workfare" only began in the UK in the early-1990s with the [[First Major ministry|first Major government]]'s "Community Action" scheme in 1993 which was replaced in 1996 with the better known "Project Work" which was subsequently replaced by [[New Labour]]'s "[[New Deal (United Kingdom)|New Deal]]", welfare to work or "active labour market policies" go back much earlier to 1986 and the second Thatcher government's introduction of compulsory "Restart" interviews for unemployed claimants. Restart lasted until 1991 when it was superseded by the "make work" scheme "Employment Action" which lasted until 1993. "Make work schemes" are not workfare as such, but are very much a composite part of welfare to work or "active labour market policies" aka "welfare reform". 

The definition used here to distinguish between "outright" workfare, and "make work schemes", is that workfare is "work for benefits" either for a company, or in the public sector, or what has been called "bogus volunteering" for a charity. This is undertaken as the condition of still being able to claim unemployment benefit, as distinct from claimants receiving that but also being in receipt of "a small supplemental payment"&lt;ref name="Work Schemes"&lt;/ref&gt;. {{cite web|url=http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/SN06249|title=Briefing Paper Work Schemes No 0626949 Aliyah Dar p.11 |publisher=House of Commons Library|date=25 June 2015 |accessdate=20 December 2017|}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

As such, it can be argued that welfare to work/"active labour market policies" first properly appeared in the early 1980s along with mass unemployment, in the form of the state run [[Manpower Services Commission]] created by the [[Edward Heath|Heath]] government in the early 1970s whilst [[Full Employment]] still existed, along with the [[Youth Opportunities Programme]] scheme first introduced by the [[James Callaghan|Callaghan]] Labour government of the late-70s but being continued and further applied by the incoming Conservative government. The YOP was replaced in 1983 by the better-known [[Youth Training Scheme]] (YTS).

Although workfare did exist in the 2000s under New Labour, it was not widely publicized or widely used. In the 2010s, under the Conservative-led coalition government it became widely used and widely known along with large scale and highly effective opposition which has continued under the Conservative government elected in 2015, leading to many dozens of organizations withdrawing from one or all of what were seven different schemes. This became five after the DWP announced in November 2015 that it was "not renewing" two of its flagship schemes, "Community Work Placements" and "Mandatory Work Activity".&lt;ref name="DWP Spending Review"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.uk/government/news/department-for-work-and-pensions-settlement-at-the-spending-review |title=Department for Work and Pensions’settlement at the Spending Review |publisher=DWP |date=2015-12-25 |accessdate=2015-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, the Prime Minister's Office announced proposals under which [[Jobseeker's Allowance]] claimants who haven't found a job once they have been through a work programme will do a 26-week placement in the community for 30 hours a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Community Work For Job Seekers|url=http://www.number10.gov.uk/news/community-work-for-job-seekers/|work=Number10.gov.uk|publisher=HM Government|accessdate=19 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[The Guardian]] in 2012, under the Government's [http://www.dwp.gov.uk/docs/wp-cap-1.pdf Community Action Programme] people who have been out of work for a number of years "must work for six months unpaid, including at profit-making businesses, in order to keep their benefits".&lt;ref name="waterstones"&gt;{{cite news|last=Malik|first=Shiv|title=Waterstones ends unpaid work placements after investigation|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/feb/03/waterstones-ends-unpaid-work-placements|work=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|accessdate=19 February 2012|location=London|date=3 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These developments followed years of concern and discussion by people both for and against such schemes. In 1999, the UK charity [[Child Poverty Action Group]] expressed concern that a government announcement that single parents and the disabled may have to attend repeated interviews for jobs under threat of losing benefits was "a step towards a US-style workfare system".  The Social Security Secretary at the time, [[Alistair Darling]], described the plan as "harsh, but justifiable", claiming that it would help address the "poverty of expectation" of many people on benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Britain heading towards workfare', says charity|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/370057.stm|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|accessdate=19 February 2012|date=15 June 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 research undertaken by the [[Centre for Regional Economic and Social Research]] (CRESR) for the [[Department for Work and Pensions]] (DWP) found that there was little evidence that workfare programmes increased the likelihood of finding paid  employment and could instead reduce the prospect of finding paid employment by "limiting the time available for job search and by failing to provide the skills and experience valued by employers."&lt;ref&gt;Crisp, Richard and Fletcher, Del Roy.(2008) "A comparative review of workfare programmes in the United States, Canada and Australia" [[Department for Work and Pensions]] Research Report No 533. [[Office of Public Sector Information|HMSO]].&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the report, [[Digby Jones, Baron Jones of Birmingham|Digby, Lord Jones]], former [[Minister of State for Trade|Minister of State for Trade and Investment]], said in April 2010 that Britain needs to adopt American-style workfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lord Digby Jones says Britain needs US-style 'workfare'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8637331.stm|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|accessdate=19 February 2012|date=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During their 2013 annual conference the Conservative Party announced a new scheme, called [[Help to Work]], the workfare aspect of which "Community Work Placements" expected claimants to work for up to 30 hours a week for 26 weeks in return for JSA (Job Seekers Allowance). The scheme was introduced in April 2014, but scrapped in November 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.insidehousing.co.uk/work-for-dole-scheme-launched-today/7003421.article&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The government has announced Help to Work - a new scheme designed to tackle long term unemployment.|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/help-to-work-scheme-announced-by-the-government|accessdate=2 October 2013|date=30 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pick up litter for your dole: Long-term jobless will also clean up graffiti or cook for the elderly in Tory 'work for benefits' plan|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2438020/George-Osbornes-work-dole-plan-Pick-litter-clean-graffiti-cook-elderly-welfare-benefits.html|accessdate=2 October 2013|date=30 September 2013|location=London|work=Daily Mail|first=James|last=Chapman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Schemes==
A myriad of contemporary workfare schemes exist, or existed until quite recently. The anti-workfare group [[Boycott Workfare]] list eight schemes involving the risk of benefit loss (directly and indirectly).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.boycottworkfare.org/?page_id=663&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Help to Work]]
*[[Mandatory Work Activity]]
*[[Work Programme (United Kingdom)|Work Programme]]
*[[Community Action Programme]]
*Sector-Based Work Academies
*Work Experience
*Steps to Work (Northern Ireland only) 
*Day One Support for Young People Trailblazer

==Support==
[[Image:Chris Grayling Official.jpg|thumb|right|199px|The former [[Work and Pensions Minister]] [[Chris Grayling]] (pictured) had supported workfare policies as a means of tackling unemployment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://graduatefog.co.uk/2012/2028/chris-grayling-polly-toynbee-workfar/ |title=Chris Grayling defends Workfare AGAIN (Jeez, when will he give it up?) |publisher=Graduate Fog |date= |accessdate=2012-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In 2012, right-wing political blogger [[Paul Staines]] argued in support of workfare on his blog ''Guido Fawkes'', writing:

* That it is not unfair that individuals have to work in return for receiving help from the state in the form of benefits.&lt;ref name="order-order1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://order-order.com/2012/02/18/in-praise-of-workfare/ |title=In Praise of Workfare - Guy Fawkes' blog |publisher=Order-order.com |date=2012-02-18 |accessdate=2012-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* That workfare participants benefit from "real world work experience".&lt;ref name="order-order1"/&gt;
* That working taxpayers whose taxes which fund part of the recipients' benefit payments are the ones who are "forced to slave".&lt;ref name="order-order1"/&gt;
* That there is no compulsion to workfare as individuals are able to sign off, "get a job and stop claiming benefits" if they wish.&lt;ref name="order-order1"/&gt;

Chris Grayling has attacked what he calls the "[[Polly Toynbee]] left" for failing to understand the modern labour market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Patrick Wintour, political editor |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/apr/18/chris-grayling-polly-toynbee-left |title=Employment minister Chris Grayling rails at 'Polly Toynbee left' &amp;#124; Politics |publisher=The Guardian |date= 18 April 2012|accessdate=2012-10-04 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The [[Trade Union Congress]] (TUC), a federation of trade unions in the United Kingdom, has stated that workfare is exploitation of the unemployed, "paying" them below the [[National Minimum Wage Act 1998|minimum wage]]. The TUC  also highlight that workfare is unfair to paid workers who find themselves in competition with unpaid workers. In these cases the TUC claims that the result would be job losses and the deterioration of pay, overtime or other conditions. Employers who opted not to use workfare workers would also find themselves competing with other firms who are "effectively being subsidised".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Say no to workfare: a TUC Charter on work experience|work=[[Trades Union Congress|TUC]]|date=18 May 2012|accessdate=6 June 2012|url=http://www.tuc.org.uk/economy/tuc-21054-f0.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper claimed in February 2012 that businesses in the UK which take staff via "work for your benefits programmes" included [[Asda]], [[Maplin Electronics|Maplin]], [[Primark]], [[Holland &amp; Barrett]], [[Boots UK|Boots]], and [[McDonald's]]. The policy is similar to that which the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] administration hoped to introduce in the mid to late 1990s, which would most likely have been carried through had [[John Major]] not been defeated by [[Tony Blair]] in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997 general election]]. Critics also ascertain that the majority of menial, low paid jobs would end up being carried out by people on workfare who, because they are working but unpaid, would not be counted among the unemployment figures.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} In an article in the Huffington Post, Dr Simon Duffy likened workfare to slavery. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/dr-simon-duffy/workfare-is-modernised-slavery_b_2773051.html&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Green Party of England and Wales]] has also voiced its opposition to workfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Writing Off Workfare: For a Green New Deal, not the Flexible New Deal|work=[[Green Party of England and Wales|Green Party]]|date=28 Oct 2008|accessdate=8 Aug 2013|url=http://greenparty.org.uk/news/workfare-is-not-the-answer.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[https://www.academia.edu/15164816/Workfare_revisited Academics have argued] that, as workfare participants are essentially providing work that is beneficial to the employer, whether public or private, they should be granted employment status (as a worker or an employee) or, at least, employment protection, even regardless of status.

===Academic analysis===
Academic analysis by the Department of Work and Pensions has cast doubt on the effectiveness of workfare policies. After surveying the international evidence available from America, Canada and Australia the report states:

{{quote|There is little evidence that workfare increases the likelihood of finding work. It can even reduce employment chances by limiting the time available for job search and by failing to provide the skills and experience valued by employers. Subsidised ("transitional") job schemes that pay a wage can be more effective in raising employment levels than 'work for benefit' programmes. Workfare is least effective in getting people into jobs in weak labour markets where unemployment is high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://research.dwp.gov.uk/asd/asd5/report_abstracts/rr_abstracts/rra_533.asp |title=A comparative review of workfare programmes in the United States, Canada and Australia |publisher=Research.dwp.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Backlash===
Opposition to workfare has caused a number of companies to withdraw from "workfare" schemes. A [[List_of_British_organisations_who_have_participated_in_workfare_programmes|number of organisations]] including [[Maplin Electronics|Maplin]], [[Waterstones]], [[Sainsbury's]], [[TK Maxx]] and the [[Arcadia Group]] withdrew from the scheme in early 2012. [[Argos (retailer)|Argos]] and [[Superdrug]] announced they were suspending their involvement pending talks with ministers.&lt;ref name="waterstones" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Workfare that shames UK plc or a leftwing plot by the job snobs?|first=Alexandra|last=Topping|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=28 February 2012|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/feb/28/workfare-uk-plot-job-snobs|accessdate=7 June 2012|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clothing retailer [[Matalan]] subsequently suspended its involvement in the scheme in order to conduct a review of the terms of such placements, with a spokesman for the DWP saying "The scheme is voluntary and no one is forced to take part and the threat of losing the benefit only starts once a week has passed on the placement - this was designed to provide certainty to employers and the individuals taking part"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Matalan reviews role in Get Britain Working scheme|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-17086526|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|date=18 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==

===Tesco===
There was controversy later in February 2012 following the involvement of the [[Tesco]] supermarket chain in a government workfare scheme linked to the payment of benefits.  An advert appeared on the Jobseekers' Plus website in which Tesco sought permanent workers in exchange for expenses and jobseeker's allowance.  After the advert was highlighted by users of Facebook and Twitter, the supermarket claimed its appearance was a mistake and that it was intended to be "an advert for work experience with a guaranteed job interview at the end of it as part of a Government-led work experience scheme".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tesco drops 'job for benefits' ad for Suffolk store|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-suffolk-17066420|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|accessdate=19 February 2012|date=16 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A protest about this advert later caused the temporary closure of a Tesco store near the [[Palace of Westminster|Houses of Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tesco job advert protest closes store in Westminster|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-17084634|work=BBC New|publisher=BBC|accessdate=19 February 2012|date=18 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poundland===
{{see also|Caitlin Reilly and Jamieson Wilson v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions}}
The discount retailer Poundland's participation in a workfare scheme has been controversial. A graduate took the Department of Work and Pensions to Court arguing that participation in a workfare scheme was a breach of her human rights guaranteed by the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]. Caitlin Reilly and Jamieson Wilson lost the case but the decision was reversed on appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theweek.co.uk/uk-news/51471/workfare-scheme-setback-poundland-slave-wins-appeal|title=Workfare scheme setback as Poundland 'slave' wins appeal|author=|date=12 February 2013|work=The Week UK|accessdate=17 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the appeal decision was made primarily on technical grounds, and the judge found no breach of Article 4 of the European Convention on Human Rights.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}.

===Home Retail Group===

[[Home Retail Group]], the parent company of [[Argos (retailer)|Argos]] and [[Homebase]], were also widely criticised for their involvement in Workfare. It was reported they would not offer jobs to people who successfully completed the scheme (with Argos simply issuing certificates of completion to those wanting jobs). A key moment for those who opposed Workfare was when a poster produced for internal purposes by Homebase condoning that unpaid work in the scheme was a way of reducing operating costs, was leaked to the public. After this, Home Retail Group soon announced their discontinuation in the scheme.[http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/04/05/homebase-workfare-work-experience-staff-_n_3020487.html]
