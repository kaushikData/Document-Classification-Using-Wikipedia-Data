'''Ahmed Salah Said al-Ghamdi''' ({{lang-ar|احمد صلاة سعيد الغامدي}}, {{transl|ar|''Aḥmad Ṣalāt Sa‘īd al-Ghāmdī''}}, also [[transliteration|transliterated]] as '''Alghamdi''') (July 2, 1979&lt;ref&gt;http://www.globalsecurity.org/security/profiles/ahmed_al-ghamdi.htm&lt;/ref&gt; – September 11, 2001) was one of five [[Hijackers in the September 11 attacks|hijackers]] of [[United Airlines Flight 175]] as part of the [[September 11 attacks]].&lt;ref&gt;Unless otherwise sourced, statements in this article come primarily from the [[9/11 Commission Report]].&lt;br&gt;[[National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States]] ([[Richard Ben-Veniste|Ben-Veniste, Richard]]; [[Fred F. Fielding|Fielding, Fred F.]]; [[Jamie Gorelick|Gorelick, Jamie]]; [[Slade Gorton|Gorton, Slade]]; [[Lee H. Hamilton|Hamilton, Lee H.]]; [[Thomas Kean|Kean, Thomas]]; [[Bob Kerrey|Kerrey, Bob]]; [[John F. Lehman|Lehman, John F.]]; [[Timothy J. Roemer|Roemer, Timothy J.]]; [[James R. Thompson|Thompson, James R.]]) (2004). ''The [[9/11 Commission Report]]: Final Report of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States.'' W.W. Norton &amp; Company. {{ISBN|0-393-32671-3}}, also available [http://www.gpoaccess.gov/911/index.html online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100807204647/http://www.gpoaccess.gov/911/index.html |date=2010-08-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ghamdi was born in [[Saudi Arabia]] in 1979. He dropped out of school to fight in [[Chechnya]] and was probably sent to train in [[al-Qaeda]] camps in [[Afghanistan]] where he would be chosen by [[Osama bin Laden]] to participate in the terrorist attacks in America.

He arrived in the United States in May 2001 on a tourist visa and helped plan out how the attacks would take place. On September 11, 2001, he boarded [[United Airlines Flight 175]] and assisted in the hijacking of the plane so that lead hijacker and trained pilot [[Marwan al-Shehhi]] could take over the plane and crash it into the South Tower of the [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|World Trade Center]], as part of the coordinated attacks.

== History ==
An [[Imam]],&lt;ref name="willalOmari"&gt;Videotape of recorded will of [[Abdulaziz al-Omari]] and others&lt;/ref&gt; Ghamdi was from the [[al Bahah Province]] of [[Saudi Arabia]], a province in the south west of Saudi Arabia. It is the capital of Al Bahah Province nestled between the resorts of Mecca and Abha, Al Bahah is one of the Kingdom’s prime tourist attractions. Ghamdi shared the same tribal affiliation with fellow hijackers [[Saeed al-Ghamdi]], [[Hamza al-Ghamdi]], and [[Ahmed al-Haznawi]]. This group is noted as being some of the more religiously observant of the hijackers, and they are thought to have met each other some time in 1999.

Known as ''al-Jaraah al-Ghamdi'' during the preparations, the only one of the hijackers to use a variation on his own name,&lt;ref name="willalOmari"/&gt; Ghamdi quit school to fight in [[Chechnya]] against the [[Russia]]ns in 2000, and received a US Visa on September 3 of that year. In November, both he and [[Salem al-Hazmi]] flew to [[Beirut]], though on separate flights and at different times. Ghamdi flew on the same flight as a senior [[Hezbollah]] operative, although the 9/11 Commission could find no evidence that either knew the other. His family claims to have last seen him in December.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Ahmed-LicenseApp.jpg|thumb|left|160px|Virginia ID Photo]] --&gt;In March 2001, Ghamdi is reported to have met with a [[Jordan]]ian who has been charged with providing false identification to at least 50 illegal aliens. Hijackers [[Majed Moqed]], [[Hani Hanjour]], and [[Nawaf al-Hazmi]] are reported to have met with him at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;''Associated Press'' March 6, 2002. "Four Hijackers Stayed at CT Motel"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On May 2, Ghamdi arrived in the U.S. with fellow-hijacker Moqed, on a [[F-1 visa|student visa]]. He listed the Naval Air Station in [[Pensacola, Florida]] as his permanent address on his driver's license.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} He and Moqed moved in with [[Hani Hanjour]] and [[Nawaf al-Hazmi]] in [[Falls Church, Virginia]]. All four later moved into an apartment in [[Paterson, New Jersey]].

He called his parents in July 2001, but did not mention being in the United States.

== Attacks ==
{{Main|United Airlines Flight 175}}
[[Hamza al-Ghamdi]] purchased Ahmed's ticket online for [[United Airlines Flight 175]] on August 29 or August 30, after buying his own.  He listed a [[Mail Boxes Etc.]] address for Ahmed.

Hamza and Ahmed al-Ghamdi stayed at the Charles Hotel in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. On September 8, they checked out of the hotel, and moved into the [[Days Inn|Days Hotel]] on Soldiers Field Road in [[Brighton, Massachusetts|Brighton]], where they remained up until the day of the attacks.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Mueller|Mueller, Robert S., III]] (09/26/02). [http://www.fas.org/irp/congress/2002_hr/092602mueller.html ''Statement for the Record''], ''Joint Investigation Into September 11th: Closed Hearing''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

On the morning of September 11, 2001, Ahmed left the hotel with Hamza, the two of them sharing a [[taxicab]] to get to [[Logan International Airport]]. There, Ghamdi showed his Virginia ID Card as identification, and boarded Flight 175 where he sat the furthest back of the hijackers, in seat 9D, helped to hijack it, and assisted as the plane crashed into the [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|World Trade Center]]. Ahmed and [[Hamza al-Ghamdi]] pushed the passengers and crew to the back of the plane while [[Fayez Banihammad]] and [[Mohand al-Shehri]] killed the pilots Victor Saracini and Michael Horrocks allowing [[Marwan al-Shehhi]] to take control of the plane.

[[Commander (Royal Navy)|Commander]] '''Alexander "Alastair" Guthrie Denniston''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|CB|CMG|CBE|RNVR}} (1 December 1881 – 1 January 1961) was a British codebreaker in [[Room 40]], first head of the [[Government Code and Cypher School]] (GC&amp;CS) and [[field hockey]] player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=Joel | last=Greenberg | authorlink=Joel Greenberg | title=Alastair Denniston: Code-breaking From Room 40 to Berkeley Street and the Birth of GCHQ | publisher=[[Frontline Books]] | isbn=978-1526709127 | year=2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Denniston was appointed operational head of GC&amp;CS in 1919 and remained so until February 1942.&lt;ref name="odnb"&gt;F. H. Hinsley, revised by Ralph Erskine, "Denniston, Alexander Guthrie [Alastair] (1881–1961), cryptanalyst and intelligence officer", ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Denniston was born in [[Greenock]], [[Renfrewshire (historic)|Renfrewshire]], the son of a medical practitioner.&lt;ref name="odnb"/&gt; He studied at the [[University of Bonn]] and the [[University of Paris]].&lt;ref name="odnb"/&gt; Denniston was a member of the Scottish Olympic field hockey team in [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]] and won a bronze medal.

==First World War and interbellum==
In 1914 Denniston helped form [[Room 40]] in the Admiralty, an organisation responsible for intercepting and decrypting enemy messages. In 1917 he married a fellow Room 40 worker, Dorothy Mary Gilliat.&lt;ref name="odnb"/&gt;

After [[First World War]], Denniston, recognising the strategic importance of codebreaking, kept the Room 40 activity functioning.&lt;ref name=hut6story&gt;{{Cite book | last = Welchman | first = Gordon | authorlink = Gordon Welchman | year = 1997 | title = The Hut 6 Story | publisher = M &amp; M Baldwin | location = Oxford | isbn = 978-0-947712-34-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|8}}  Room 40 was merged with its counterpart in the Army, [[MI1b]] in 1919, renamed the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&amp;CS) in 1920 and transferred from the Navy to the Foreign Office. Denniston was chosen to run the new organisation.

With the rise of [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]], Denniston began making preparations. Following the practice of his superiors at Room 40, he contacted lecturers at Oxford and Cambridge (including [[Alan Turing]] and [[Gordon Welchman]]) asking if they would be willing to serve if war broke out. He chose [[Bletchley Park|Bletchley]] as the location for the codebreaking effort because it was at a [[Bletchley railway station|rail junction]] on a main line {{convert|47|mi|km}} north of London with good rail connections to Oxford and Cambridge and MI6 boss, Hugh Sinclair, acquired the [[Bletchley Park]] property. Denniston was involved in preparing the site and designing the huts to be built on the grounds. The GC&amp;CS moved to the new location in August 1939, just before the [[Invasion of Poland]] and the start of the [[Second World War]]. Its name changed to [[Government Communications Headquarters]] (GCHQ).&lt;ref name=hut6story/&gt;{{rp|9–10}}

On 26 July 1939, five weeks before the outbreak of war, Denniston was one of three Britons (along with [[Dilly Knox]] and Humphrey Sandwith) who participated in the trilateral Polish-French-British conference held in the [[Kabaty Woods]] south of [[Warsaw]], at which the [[Poland|Polish]] [[Biuro Szyfrów]] (Cipher Bureau) initiated the French and British into the [[decryption]] of [[Germany|German]] military [[Enigma machine|Enigma]] [[cipher]]s.&lt;ref name="pyry"&gt;Ralph Erskine, "The Poles Reveal their Secrets: Alastair Denniston's Account of the July 1939 Meeting at Pyry", pp. 294–305, Cryptologia 30(4), 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second World War==
Denniston remained in command until he was hospitalised in June 1940 for a [[bladder stone]]. Despite his illness, he flew to the United States in 1941 to make contact with American cryptographers including [[William Friedman]]. Denniston returned to Bletchley Park for a while but moved to London later in 1941 to work on diplomatic traffic.&lt;ref name=hut6story/&gt;{{rp|10}}

Despite his knowledge of the success of Polish cryptologists against Enigma, Denniston shared the general pessimism about the prospects of breaking the more complex Naval Enigma encryption until as late as the summer of 1940, having told the Head of Naval Section at Bletchley: "You know, the Germans don't mean you to read their stuff, and I don't expect you ever will."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.turing.org.uk/publications/profsbook.html Preface to Turing's Treatise on the Enigma (the Prof's Book)], [[Andrew Hodges]], 1998&lt;/ref&gt; The advent of [[Banburismus]] shortly afterwards showed his pessimism to be misplaced. In October 1941, the originator of the technique, [[Alan Turing]], along with fellow senior cryptologists [[Gordon Welchman]], [[Stuart Milner-Barry]] and [[Conel Hugh O'Donel Alexander|Hugh Alexander]] wrote to Churchill, over the head of Denniston, to alert Churchill to the fact that a shortage of staff at Bletchley Park was preventing them from deciphering many messages. An addition of personnel, small by military standards, could make a big difference to the effectiveness of the fighting effort. The slow response to previous requests had convinced them that the strategic value of their work was not understood in the right quarters. In the letter, there was praise for the 'energy and foresight' of Commander [[Edward Travis]].&lt;ref name=Hod&gt;{{cite book| last=Hodges | first=Andrew | authorlink=Andrew Hodges | year=1983 | title=[[Alan Turing: the Enigma]] | publisher=[[Simon and Schuster]] | pages=219–223 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Churchill reacted to the letter immediately, ordering "Action this day". Resources were transferred as fast as possible.

In February 1942, GC&amp;CS was reorganised. Travis, Denniston's second in command and chief of the Naval section, succeeded Denniston at Bletchley Park, overseeing the work on military codes and ciphers.
When Travis took over, he "presided over an administrative revolution which at last brought the management of Intelligence into line with its mode of production".&lt;ref name=Hod/&gt;

==Personal and post-war life==
Denniston and his wife had two children: a son and daughter. Their son, [[Robin Denniston|Robin]], was educated at [[Westminster School]] and [[Christ Church, Oxford]]. After Alastair's demotion and resulting decreased income, Robin's school fees were paid by benefactors. However, the Dennistons' daughter had to leave her school due to lack of funds.&lt;ref name="Robin_obit"&gt;[[The Daily Telegraph]], 27 May 2012 [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/9293492/Robin-Denniston.html Obituary: Robin Denniston]&lt;/ref&gt;

Denniston retired in 1945, and later taught French and Latin in [[Leatherhead]].&lt;ref name="odnb"/&gt;

[[William Friedman]], the American cryptographer who broke the Japanese [[Purple code]], later wrote to Denniston's daughter "Your father was a great man in whose debt all English-speaking people will remain for a very long time, if not forever. That so few should know exactly what he did ... is the sad part."&lt;ref name=hut6story/&gt;{{rp|11}}

Robin distinguished himself as a publisher. In 2007, he published ''Thirty Secret Years,'' a biography of his father that consolidated his reputation in GCHQ history.&lt;ref name="Robin_obit" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2512">'''Alexandrine Charlotte''' "'''Rosalie'''" '''de Rohan-Chabot''' (1763-1839), the ''[[Duc de La Rochefoucauld|duchesse de La Rochefoucauld]]'' was a French duchess and letter writer, known for the events of her life during the [[French Revolution]].

She witnessed the infamous [[Reign of Terror]] at firsthand, including the assassination of her husband (and uncle) the [[Louis Alexandre de La Rochefoucauld d'Enville|Duc de La Rochefoucauld]] in [[Gisors]] during the [[September Massacres]] (they had married in 1780 and the marriage was childless) and the execution of her brother. In 1810 she remarried to her relation Boniface Louis Andre, Marquis de Castellane.&lt;ref&gt;Shackelford, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt;

She was also the lover of U.S. ambassador [[William Short (American ambassador)|William Short]], the "adoptive son" of [[Thomas Jefferson]]. Their love affair was recorded in hundreds of letters, which document the lovers' pains of separation and their frustration with social norms. Likewise, their words of devotion are especially poetic and moving. The love letters are an authentic literary contribution, and offer personal insights into a turbulent era of world history.&lt;ref&gt;“William Short, Jefferson's Only "Son"”  The North American Review, September 1926, p. 471-486&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alice de Janzé''', née '''Silverthorne''' (28 September 1899 – 30 September 1941),&lt;ref name="ReferencePlaceDate"&gt;Reed, Frank Fremont (1982). ''History of the Silverthorn Family, Vol. 4'',p. 550. Chicago: DuBane's Print Shop. Her birth and death date can also be found at http://www.ancestry.com/trees/awt/main.aspx. (free registration required)&lt;/ref&gt; also known as '''Alice de Trafford''' and holder of the [[Royal and noble ranks|noble title]] '''[[Count|Comtesse (Countess)]] de Janzé''' for a few years, was an American [[Beneficiary|heiress]] who spent years in [[Kenya]] as a member of the [[Happy Valley set]] of colonials. She was connected with numerous [[scandal]]s, including the attempted murder of her lover in 1927, and the 1941 murder of [[Josslyn Hay, 22nd Earl of Erroll|The 22nd Earl of Erroll]] in Kenya. Her tempestuous life was marked by promiscuity, drug abuse and several suicide attempts.

Growing up in Chicago and New York, Silverthorne was one of the most prominent American socialites of her time; a relative of the powerful [[Armour and Company|Armour]] family, she was a multi-millionaire heiress. She entered French [[aristocracy]] in 1921, when she married Count de Janzé. In the mid-1920s, she was introduced to the infamous Happy Valley set, a community of [[White people in Kenya|white]] [[expatriates]] in East Africa, notorious for their [[hedonism|hedonistic]] lifestyle. In 1927, she made international news when she shot her lover Raymond de Trafford in a Paris railway station and then turned the gun on herself; they both survived. De Janze stood trial but was only fined a small amount, and was later [[pardon]]ed by the French state. She further scandalized the public by marrying, and then later divorcing, the man she shot.

In 1941, she was one of several major suspects in the well-publicized murder of her former lover and friend, Lord Erroll, in Kenya. After a long history of numerous [[failed suicide attempt]]s, she died of a self-inflicted gunshot in September 1941. Her personality has been referenced both in fiction and non-fiction, most notably in the book ''White Mischief'' and its [[White Mischief (film)|film adaptation]], where she was portrayed by [[Sarah Miles]].

==Early life==
[[File:alice silverthorne.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Alice in Chicago, 1919.]]

Alice was born in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[Erie County, New York]],&lt;ref name="ReferencePlaceDate" /&gt; the only child of textile industrialist William Edward Silverthorne and wife, Julia Belle Chapin (14 August 1871&lt;ref&gt;Chapin, Gilbert Warren (1924). ''The Chapin Book of Genealogical Data: With Brief Biographical Sketches, of the Descendants of Deacon Samuel Chapin, Vol. 2''. Chapin Family Association, p. 1795&lt;/ref&gt; – 2 June 1907)&lt;ref name="ReferenceF"&gt;Reed, Frank Fremont (1982). ''The History of the Silverthorn Family, Vol. 4''. Chicago: DuBane's Print Shop, p. 434&lt;/ref&gt; a relative to the Armour family, of meatpacking success through the [[Armour &amp; Company]] brand, at the time the largest food products company in the world.&lt;ref name="ReferenceO" /&gt; Silverthorne was a first cousin, once removed, to [[J. Ogden Armour]] and great-niece to [[Philip Danforth Armour]] and [[Herman Ossian Armour]], the granddaughter of their sister Marietta, who left much of her estate to her mother, Julia, in 1897.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1897/11/18/102085411.pdf ''The New York Times'', 18 November 1897. "Mrs. Chapin Leaves $500,000", p. 1]&lt;/ref&gt; William and Julia were married in Chicago on 8 June 1892,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilsos.gov/GenealogyMWeb/marrsrch.html Illinois Statewide Marriage Index, 1763–1900] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218192844/http://www.ilsos.gov/GenealogyMWeb/marrsrch.html |date=18 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Chicago Tribune'', 29 May 1892. "Month of Weddings", p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; the city where Alice spent most of her childhood and adolescence, living with her parents in the affluent [[Gold Coast Historic District (Chicago, Illinois)|Gold Coast]] district.&lt;ref name="ReferenceH"&gt;''Chicago Tribune'', Sunday Magazine, 26 May 1996. "Hey Lady! Britain's Beleaguered Princess Ain't Seen Nothin' Yet – Chicago's Rendition", p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Alice herself became a favorite of her cousin, [[J. Ogden Armour]]. Her family's great wealth prompted her childhood friends to take a cue from her surname and give her the nickname "Silver Spoon".&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=lNA_AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=-w0EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6497,668548&amp;dq=alice+de+janze&amp;hl=en ''The Milwaukee Sentinel'', 27 June 1948. Coughlin, Gene. "Battered Brides: Unhappy Hunt of the Golden Girl", p. 32]&lt;/ref&gt;

Julia Silverthorne died of complications from [[tuberculosis]] when Alice was only eight,&lt;ref name="ReferenceO" /&gt; although biographer Paul Spicer argues that her death was a result from being locked out of the house by her husband during a freezing night six months earlier.&lt;ref name="Wilson" /&gt; Alice, who inherited a large estate from her mother, was herself an asymptomatic consumptive from birth.&lt;ref name="ReferenceO"&gt;Fox James (1983). ''White Mischief''. Random House, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; Following her mother's death, Alice was raised by a German governess in large houses in New York; her alcoholic father&lt;ref name="ReferenceN"&gt;Fox, James (1982). ''White Mischief''. Random House, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;  was frequently absent due to his professional obligations. Contrary to her wishes, William Silverthorne quickly remarried in 1908,&lt;ref name="ReferenceE" /&gt; and had five children with his second wife, Louise Mattocks. Many of them did not survive; Alice's half-siblings included William Jr. (1912–1976), Victoria Louise (died in infant|infancy in 1914), Patricia (1915–?), Lawrence (1918–1923) and an unnamed girl who died in infancy in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;Reed, Frank Fremont (1982). ''History of the Silverthorn Family, Vol. 4''. Chicago: DuBane's Print Shop, p. 562&lt;/ref&gt; William later divorced Mattocks and married twice more.&lt;ref name="ReferenceF" /&gt;
[[File:Al silverthorne2.jpg|left|thumb|205x205px|Alice at [[Lake Geneva, Wisconsin]] in September 1916]]

With her father's encouragement, the precocious Alice was introduced to wild social life in her early adolescence. She was one of the more prominent socialites of Chicago, frequenting the fashionable nightclubs of the time. Her father also took her on several European tours and encouraged her image as a prominent [[debutante]]. These years of wild youth left Alice with a [[chronic (medicine)|chronic]] [[melancholia]];&lt;ref name="ReferenceO" /&gt; it is possible that she suffered from [[cyclothymia]], a strain of bipolar disorder.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/7636075/Is-this-the-Happy-Valley-murderer.html ''Telegraph''. 27 April 2010. Grice, Elizabeth. "Is This the Happy Valley Murderer?"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Her father soon lost [[child custody|custody]] of her; an uncle from her mother's side assumed the role of her legal guardian and then proceeded to place her at a boarding school in Washington D.C.&lt;ref name="ReferenceE" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceN" /&gt; Journalist [[Michael Kilian]] believes this was because William Silverthorne had an [[incest]]uous relationship with his adolescent daughter, in which she lost her virginity to her father,&lt;ref&gt;''Chicago Tribune'', 1 June 1988. Kilian, Michael. "Making ''Mischief'' Take It from the Brits: After Decades of Civility, America is Due for Some Decadence", p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Chicago Tribune'', 16 September 1987. Kilian, Michael. "Shrink to Fit? What Ever Happened to Good, Old-Fashioned Lunacy? Now, Even New Yorkers are Buying into the Therapy Fad", p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; until one of her uncles intervened and took the case to the court.&lt;ref name="ReferenceH" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Chicago Tribune'', Sunday Magazine, 20 August 1986. Kilian, Michael. "Unhappy Endings When Chicago and Europe Play at Love, the Consequences Can be Disastrous", p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;  Paul Spicer disagrees that her relationship with her father was improper.&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/non-fiction/article7110555.ece''The Times Online'', ''The Sunday Times'', 2 May 2010. Wilson, Frances. "''The Tempress: The Scandalous Life of Alice, Countess de Janze'' Review".]&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of the court decision, after fourteen-year-old Alice came to live with the Armours in New York she then openly travelled with her father to the [[French Riviera]], where Kilian claims Silverthorne openly sported her as his mistress and allowed her to keep a [[black panther]] as a pet.&lt;ref name="ReferenceH" /&gt; In later years, she was famous for parading the animal up and down the [[Promenade des Anglais]] in Nice.&lt;ref name="ReferenceN" /&gt;

==1919–1927: Marriage and the Happy Valley set==

From left to right: Raymond de Trafford, Frédéric [[Count|Comte]] de Janzé (Alice's second and first husband respectively), Alice de Janzé and [[Hugh Cholmondeley, 3rd Baron Delamere|The 3rd Baron Delamere]].]]
In 1919, Alice moved back to Chicago to live with her aunts, Mrs. Francis E. May (née Alice Chapin) and Mrs. Josephine Chapin.&lt;ref&gt;''Chicago Tribune'', 1 October 1941. "Chicago Tragic Countess Slain in East Africa", p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, Alice moved to Paris, where she briefly worked as director of the model department in [[Jean Patou|Jean Patou's]] ''[[atelier]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'', 16 June 1927. "De Janzés Divorced by Paris Tribunal", p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; until she met Frédéric Jacques, [[Count|Comte]] de Janzé (ca 1896 – 24 December 1933), a well-known French racing driver and heir to an old aristocratic family in Brittany. A participant in the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] and other races, Frédéric also frequented literary circles and was close friends with [[Marcel Proust]], [[Maurice Barrès]] and [[Anna de Noailles]].&lt;ref&gt;Fox, James (1983). ''White Mischief''. Random House, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike many other American heiresses of the period, Alice had not allowed her family to arrange an advantageous match for her, choosing to take the initiative and pursue a romance with Comte de Janzé on her own.&lt;ref name="ReferenceE" /&gt; After a romance of only three weeks,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''The New York Times'', 27 March 1927. "Chicago Relatives Amazed", p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; the couple married on 21 September 1921 in Chicago,&lt;ref&gt;"Alice Silverthorne is Vicomte's Bride", ''The New York Times'', 21 September 1921&lt;/ref&gt; with her new husband reportedly finding her "Silverthorne" surname so charming that he regretted their marriage would take it away from her.&lt;ref name="ReferenceL"&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=SrcVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Cg4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5268,786276&amp;dq=alice+silverthorne&amp;hl=en ''The Milwaukee Sentinel'', 26 October 1941. "Killed Herself Where She Lost Her Honor 15 Years Before", P. 30]&lt;/ref&gt; Following the ceremony, Alice's aunt, Mrs. J. Ogden Armour, turned over the Armour estate on Long Island to the couple, where they spent two weeks before deciding to permanently settle in Paris, in the [[Champs-Élysées]] quarter.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Los Angeles Times'', 20 April 1922. "Wedding of Mary Baker is Delayed"&lt;/ref&gt; Their marriage produced two daughters, Nolwén Louise Alice de Janzé (20 June 1922 – 7 March 1989) and Paola Marie Jeanne de Janzé (1 June 1924 – 24 December 2006). Alice was a neglectful mother as Frederic was a neglectful father; the children were primarily brought up in their family [[chateau]] Parfondeval in Normandy&lt;ref name="ReferenceN" /&gt; by governesses and Frédéric's sister.

In 1925, de Janzé  and Alice first met and became good friends with [[Josslyn Hay, 22nd Earl of Erroll|Josslyn, 22nd Earl of Erroll]], and his wife, [[Idina Sackville|Idina, Countess of Erroll]], in [[Montparnasse]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3724/is_200003/ai_n8890677/pg_2 Marnham, Patrick. "Dirty Work at the Crossroads", ''The Spectator'', 18 March 2000]&lt;/ref&gt; Some time later, the young Lord and Lady Erroll decided to invite the de Janzés to spend some time in their home in the so-called '[[Happy Valley, Kenya|Happy Valley]]' in the British [[Colony of Kenya]], a community of British colonials living in the Wanjohi Valley, near the [[Aberdare Mountains]]. This enclave had become notorious among socialites in Great Britain for being a paradise for all those seeking a [[hedonism|hedonistic]] lifestyle, including drugs, alcohol and sexual promiscuity. Noticing that Alice had become restless, Frédéric decided to distract her and agreed to the trip.&lt;ref&gt;Trzebinski, Erroll (2000). ''The Life and Death of Lord Erroll'', p. 76. Fourth Estate&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;"She Loved Him, Shot Him, Married Him, Divorced Him", ''The Oakland Tribune'', 12 December 1937&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Happy Valley, the de Janzés were neighbours to the Errolls. Frédéric Comte de Janzé documented his time in Happy Valley and all the eccentric personalities he met there in his book, ''Vertical Land'', which was published in 1928. The Comte provided several non-eponymous references to members of the [[Happy Valley set]], including a psychological portrait of his wife that alludes to her suicidal tendencies:

{{quote|Wide eyes so calm, short slick hair, full red lips, a body to desire. The powerful hands clutch and wave along the mandolin and the crooning somnolent melody breaks; her throat trembles and her gleaming shoulders droop. That weird soul of mixtures is at the door! her cruelty and lascivious thoughts clutch the thick lips on close white teeth. She holds us with her song, and her body sways towards ours. No man will touch her exclusive soul, shadowy with memories, unstable, suicidal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks07/0700731h.html#ch8.sec3 De Janzé, Frédéric.''Vertical Land''. London: Duckworth Press, 1928, Chapter VIII]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Even among the scandalous residents of Happy Valley, Alice, who was soon known as "the wicked Madonna",&lt;ref&gt;Morrow, Anne. ''Picnic in a Foreign Land: The Eccentric Lives of the Anglo-Irish''. Grafton: 2003, p. 54 {{ISBN|978-0-246-13204-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; caused a sensation with her beauty, sarcastic sense of humour, and wild and unpredictable mood swings. She was known for speaking passionately about animal rights as well as playing the ukulele,&lt;ref name="ReferenceP"&gt;''White Mischief'', p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; and soon she began an affair with Lord Erroll, [[open relationship|openly sharing him]] with Idina.&lt;ref&gt;Osborne, Frances (2009). ''The Bolter'', p. 132. Knopf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceI"&gt;[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article3866954.ece Osborne, Frances. "Sex Games and Murder in Idina's Happy Valley", ''Times Online'', 4 May 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

Alice and Frédéric later returned to Happy Valley in 1926. While Frédéric distracted himself with lion hunting, Alice began another love affair, this time with British nobleman Raymond Vincent de Trafford (28 January 1900 – 14 May 1971), son of [[Sir Humphrey de Trafford, 3rd Baronet]].  Alice's infatuation with de Trafford was so great that at some point the couple attempted to elope, although they promptly returned.&lt;ref name="Mischievous" /&gt; Frédéric was aware of his wife's open [[infidelity]], but did not become preoccupied by it,&lt;ref name="ReferenceP" /&gt; although years later he would refer to the [[love triangle]] with de Trafford as "the infernal triangle".&lt;ref&gt;''The Life and Death of Lord Erroll: The Truth Behind the Happy Valley Murder'', p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;

That autumn, in an attempt to save his marriage, Frédéric returned to Paris with Alice; he was unsuccessful. Alice visited Frédéric's mother: revealing that she was in love with de Trafford, she asked her help in obtaining a divorce. Her mother-in-law advised her to think of her two daughters and do nothing she might later regret. Alice soon returned to Kenya and her lover.&lt;ref name="ReferenceL" /&gt; Hoping to keep Alice's extramarital affair from becoming a scandal, her mother-in-law loaned Alice a furnished flat in a quiet street in Paris to use as a "love nest" with de Trafford.&lt;ref&gt;"Chicago Countess and Dashing Briton She Shot Are Near Death in Paris", ''Chicago Tribune'', 28 March 1927&lt;/ref&gt; Under pressure by his family, Frédéric quickly sued for divorce.&lt;ref name="Miami News"&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=c0AuAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=a9gFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4487,2294441&amp;dq=alice+de+janze&amp;hl=en "Paris Shocked Over Countess Love Tragedy", ''The Miami News'', 28 May 1927]&lt;/ref&gt;

==1927: The Gare du Nord shooting incident==
[[File:AliceFred.jpg|thumb|left|A newspaper article reporting the shooting incident at the [[Gare du Nord]]. Pictured are Alice and her husband, Frédéric [[Count|Comte]] de Janzé.]]
On the morning of 25 March 1927, Alice awoke in her Paris home feeling extremely agitated, according to the later testimony of her maid.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=F7wtAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5YsFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6146,4029372&amp;dq=alice+de+janze+suicide&amp;hl=en ''The Montreal Gazette'', 28 March 1927. "Countess Shot Englishman and Self in Paris", p. 13]&lt;/ref&gt; That afternoon, when Alice and Raymond de Trafford met, he informed Alice that he would not be able to marry her as his strict Catholic family had threatened to disinherit him if he followed through with the plan.&lt;ref name="Bullets"&gt;"Used Pistol Bullets Instead of Cupid Darts", ''The Milwaukee Sentinel'', 18 February 1933&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ottawa"&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-6MuAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=otkFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6929,475556&amp;dq=alice+de+trafford&amp;hl=en "First Shot Lover and then Herself", ''Ottawa Citizen'', 28 March 1927]&lt;/ref&gt; The couple later visited a sporting equipment shop together, where Alice bought a gold-mounted, pearl-handled revolver.&lt;ref name="ReferenceL" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mischievous"&gt;''White Mischief'', p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Gare du Nord]] a few hours later, as de Trafford was bidding farewell to her in his train compartment before he left for London by an express boat train, she pulled the [[revolver]] from her purse and shot him in the stomach, puncturing his lung.&lt;ref name="Mischievous" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceK" /&gt; She then shot herself in the stomach. The train conductor reported that when he opened the compartment door, Alice gasped "I did it" and then collapsed.&lt;ref name="ReferenceL" /&gt;

De Trafford spent several days in a hospital in critical condition. Alice is reported to have screamed "But he must live! I want him to live!"&lt;ref name="ReferenceE" /&gt; when she heard the news that de Trafford was too seriously wounded to survive.  Her own wound was initially overlooked by doctors during the confusion. Despite initial reports that spoke of her also being gravely injured,&lt;ref name="ReferenceX" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Countess de Janzé Weaker", ''Hartford Courant'', 29 May 1927&lt;/ref&gt; her wounds were quite superficial. One journalist reported that "she had shot herself very gently".&lt;ref name="ReferenceE" /&gt; Both Alice and de Trafford were transferred to the Laboisiere hospital. Relatives of Alice rushed to the hospital and attempted to have her transferred to a private clinic, but were stopped by the [[gendarmerie|gendarmes]] because the countess was technically under arrest.&lt;ref&gt;''Chicago Tribune'', 7 April 1927&lt;/ref&gt;

The incident made headlines all over the world.&lt;ref name="Ottawa" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"American Countess Shoots Self After Woonding Admirer", ''The Washington Post'', 27 March 1927.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Society Girl Shoots Lover and Herself", ''The Hartford Courant'', 27 March 1927&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Paris Shooting Led to Despair", ''Los Angeles Times'', 28 May 1927&lt;/ref&gt; Some confusion was caused when five British newspapers, ''[[Western Mail (Wales)|Western Mail]]'', ''[[The Guardian|The Manchester Guardian]]'', ''The Liverpool Daily Courier'', ''The Liverpool Evening Express'' and ''[[Sheffield Telegraph|Sheffield Daily Telegraph]]'', illustrated their reports of the shooting incident with pictures not of Alice, but of her sister-in-law Vicomtesse Phillis Meeta de Janzé.  The viscountess promptly sued them for libel and received a settlement.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 1 June 1927&lt;/ref&gt;

In an attempt to minimize the situation, a statement was released to the press by Alice's family, assuring the public that there was nothing in the double shooting that "casts discredit upon the names of Armour and Silverthorne, which have been honored in America many generations, nor anything which could induce a French jury to render a verdict of conviction".&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=F7wtAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5YsFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6146,4029372&amp;dq=alice+de+janze+suicide&amp;hl=en ''The Montreal Gazette'', 28 March 1927.

Alice claimed to feel regret about shooting de Trafford, who was said to be on the brink of death,&lt;ref name="ReferenceX"&gt;"Countess Reticent With Victim Dying", ''The New York Times'', 28 March 1927&lt;/ref&gt; but did not offer an explanation, telling a police official who was permitted to see her: "I decided to shoot him just as the train was leaving.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Alice de Janze trial.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Alice de Janzé consulting with her barrister while standing trial for the shooting of Raymond de Trafford, on 23 December 1927.]] --&gt;On 5 April, Alice de Janzé was officially charged with [[attempted murder]] with [[premeditated murder|premeditation]].&lt;ref&gt;"Countess Is Accused of Attempted Murder", ''The New York Times'', 5 April 1927&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Serve Countess with Homicide Attempt Papers", ''Chicago Tribune'', 5 April 1927&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 April, she made an official declaration in which she stated she originally only planned suicide when she bought the revolver, but eventually also fired at de Trafford because of anguish at parting from him.&lt;ref&gt;"Countess Explains Double Shooting", ''The New York Times'', 9 April 1927&lt;/ref&gt; In her official declaration to Judge Banquart, who was charged with investigating the case, she stated:

{{quote|I met Raymond in Kenya colony, East Africa and became his mistress. It was agreed that I would obtain a divorce to marry him. But gradually he withdrew from the bargain and came to see me in Paris on March 25 to announce that his family was opposed to the match. I already had suffered from the great deception, but when he refused my imploring that he remain with me longer I immediately determined on suicide. Then we took a last luncheon together and for the moment forgot the mental anguish. Afterward he said he would accompany me to shopping and I took him to an armorer's stone, where I bought a revolver and cartridges wrapped separately. Raymond's phlegmatic English type suspected nothing in this incident, evidently thinking that I was doing an errand for my husband. [...] In the station washroom, I had an opportunity to load the weapon, which I still intended only to use on myself, then rejoined him on a compartment of the London express. It was during the anguish of the last moment's separation as we embraced that I suddenly acted on impulse. Slipping the revolver between us, I fired upon him, then upon myself.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=5ZEuAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=-IsFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5240,1356938&amp;dq=raymond+de+trafford&amp;hl=en ''The Montreal Gazette'', April 9, 1927.

On 9 April, de Trafford returned to London by a special aeroplane, declaring to French authorities that he did not wish to take any action against Alice, although he would return to Paris if his testimony was needed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=h0AuAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=a9gFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6606,6640374&amp;dq=alice+de+janze&amp;hl=en "Plane Trip Made by de Trafford", ''The Miami News'', 18 April 1927]&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, de Janzé was held in Saint Lazare, a prison for women.&lt;ref name="ChicTrib"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://205.188.238.181/time/magazine/article/0,9171,769654,00.html "Lazare Day", ''Time'', 22 August 1932] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928081121/http://205.188.238.181/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C769654%2C00.html |date=28 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barrow, Andrew (1979).

{{quote|... The whistle of London Express blew, and I realized that he was going away from Paris – and from me forever – I suddenly changed my mind and resolved to take him away with me into the Great Beyond.

Thanks to the intervention of her aunt, Mrs. Francis May, Alice then vanished from the public eye, hidden in a nursing home close to Paris in preparation for the impending trial. Her lawyers attempted, without success, to have the charges against her dismissed.&lt;ref name="Divorcee" /&gt;  She was tried by the Paris Tribunal on 23 December 1927,&lt;ref&gt;"Will Try Countess Today", ''The New York Times'', 23 December 1927&lt;/ref&gt; but only on the charge of assault, after her celebrated advocate, René Mettetal,&lt;ref name="Bullets" /&gt; convinced the examining magistrate that she was mentally irresponsible at the time she shot de Trafford.&lt;ref&gt;''Chicago Tribune'', 17 December 1927&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Alice de Janzé to Go on Trial in Paris Tomorrow", ''Chicago Tribune'', 22 December 1927&lt;/ref&gt; When de Trafford was asked if he wanted to press charges against the countess, he expressed surprise and annoyance at the idea, claiming that his wounding was an accident that he himself caused:&lt;ref name=

{{quote|As we were about to part – she was kissing me – I told her that I loved her, and again whispered to her not to take my decision as irrevocable. I even told her that we would meet again.

The accident was due to my imprudence.&lt;ref name="laurajames.typepad.com" /&gt;}}

Alice's defense lawyer pleaded that the countess' chronic melancholy and tuberculosis had "deadened her intelligence".&lt;ref name="ReferenceW" /&gt; He also read a letter from her childhood friend, American heiress Mary Landon Baker, in which Baker claimed that Alice suffered from extreme melancholia and that she had attempted suicide a total of four times throughout her life.&lt;ref name="ReferenceW" /&gt; When asked why she took the gun with her to the railway station, Alice replied: "To kill myself. And I nearly succeeded. Didn't I shoot myself in the stomach, like poor Raymond?"&lt;ref name="ReferenceE" /&gt; She also made her plea that she be acquitted so as to not disgrace the family name of the de Janzé.&lt;ref name="ReferenceE" /&gt;

Eventually, Alice received a suspended sentence of six months in prison and a fine of 100 francs (approximately 4 U.S. dollars) by the Paris Correctional Court,&lt;ref&gt;"Chicago Countess Who Shot Lover and Herself Gets Off With a 4$ in French Court", ''The New York Times'', 24 December 1927&lt;/ref&gt; who rebuked de Trafford for his failure to deliver his promise to marry her, out of fear of losing the family allowance.&lt;ref name="ReferenceK" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Gossip: A History of High Society from 1920 to 1970'', p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; Although it was criticized by some newspapers,&lt;ref name="ReferenceK" /&gt; this lenient decision may have been influenced by the revelation concerning Alice's frequent suicide attempts, de Trafford's taking responsibility for her state of mind,&lt;ref name="Luxe" /&gt; and the public's sympathetic view of her as the tragic victim of a true [[crime of passion]]. Even the prosecuting attorney insisted upon leniency and declared that "I should not like to bear de Trafford's responsibility for a broken heart and a disrupted home".&lt;ref name="Luxe"&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=kGstAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=cYsFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4727,491281&amp;dq=alice+silverthorne&amp;hl=en "Countess de Luxe", ''Palm Beach Daily News'', 27 December 1927]&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the First Offenders Act, Alice was immediately released,&lt;ref&gt;''Gossip: A History of High Society from 1920 to 1970'', p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;
and on 13 April 1929 she received a full presidential pardon from [[Gaston Doumergue]], the [[president of the French Republic]],&lt;ref&gt;"Frees Countess de Janzé", ''The New York Times'', 14 April 1929&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=2okLAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=fFQDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4866,1295994&amp;dq=alice+de+janze&amp;hl=en ''The Evening Independent'', 13 April 1929]&lt;/ref&gt; so that even the fine she had been forced to pay was returned to her by the court.&lt;ref name="ReferenceL" /&gt; The request for the pardon was partially made to avoid any commercial repercussions the conviction might cause.&lt;ref&gt;"American Countess is Pardoned in Shooting", ''The Lima News'', 13 April 1929&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of the shooting scandal, a divorce was granted to Frédéric de Janzé, on the grounds of desertion, by the Paris Tribunal on 15 June 1927.&lt;ref name="Divorcee"&gt;"Count de Janzé Divorces Wife, Who Shot Man", ''Chicago Tribune'', 16 June 1927&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"De Janzes Divorced by Paris Tribunal", ''The New York Times'', 16 June 1927&lt;/ref&gt; While no mention was made of the Gare du Nord episode, Alice was to receive no alimony and Frédéric was granted custody of their two children.&lt;ref name="ReferenceL" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Americans Win Paris Divorces", ''Los Angeles Times'', 16 June 1927&lt;/ref&gt;

That December, Alice shocked both the count and the newspapers when she declared that she would remarry her husband for "the sake of the children";&lt;ref name="ReferenceG" /&gt; she later retracted her statement.&lt;ref name="ReferenceE" /&gt; The civil divorce was followed by an annulment of the marriage by the Vatican on 26 July 1928;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,787476,00.html?promoid=googlep "Milestone" ''Time'', 6 August 1928]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Chicago Tribune'', 26 July 1928&lt;/ref&gt; Frédéric's attorneys then warned every newspaper in England never to refer to Alice as Countess de Janzé again.&lt;ref name="ReferenceL" /&gt; Frédéric died on 24 December 1933, in Baltimore of [[sepsis|septicaemia]].&lt;ref&gt;"Com.

==1928–1941: Second marriage, divorce and return to Kenya==
Following the public ordeal, de Trafford advised Alice against returning to London for a while.&lt;ref name="ReferenceE" /&gt; In early 1928, she returned to Kenya, but, in light of her public scandal, was soon ordered by the Government House to leave the country as an "undesirable alien".&lt;ref name="WhitM" /&gt; In the following weeks, until she could properly organize her departure and wanting a relatively peaceful place where she could rest after the ordeal, she stayed for a while at the house of writer [[Karen Blixen]], a good friend of Lord Erroll.&lt;ref&gt;Title unknown, ''[[L'Intermédiaire des chercheurs et curieux]]'', issue 643, June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  She also resumed her affair with the Earl.&lt;ref name="ReferenceE" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WhitM"&gt;''White Mischief'', p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; Months later, living in Paris and growing indignant about the rumours, she publicly refuted that she had been asked to leave Kenya.&lt;ref&gt;"Countess de Janzé Says She Was Not Ousted From Africa", ''Chicago Tribune'', 8 May 1928&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until years later that Alice was able to return, thanks to the intervention of both de Janzé and de Trafford, who convinced the Kenyan Government to re-admit her.&lt;ref name="ReferenceE" /&gt;

Around this time, Alice caused a new sensation when it was revealed she had resumed her love affair with de Trafford, the man she had almost killed. A rumor that the couple would soon have a quiet wedding in Paris was first circulated in May 1927,&lt;ref name="ChicTrib"&gt;''Chicago Tribune'', 8 May 1927&lt;/ref&gt; then in September of that same year&lt;ref&gt;"Shot Wins Hubby", ''The Charleston Gazette'', 15 September 1927&lt;/ref&gt; and later in January 1928.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=qjkbAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=MUoEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2648,1559267&amp;dq=alice+de+janze&amp;hl=en "American May Marry Britisher She Shot", ''The Pittsburgh Press'', 30 January 1928]&lt;/ref&gt; Alice's lawyer denied any such plans, and no wedding took place.&lt;ref&gt;"Lawyer Denies Alice de Janzé Plans to Marry", ''Chicago Daily Tribune'', 30 January 1928&lt;/ref&gt; The rumor surfaced again in April 1930.&lt;ref&gt;''Syracuse Herald'', 7 April 1930&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, the couple married on 22 February 1932 in [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3LALAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=j1QDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5628,3890909&amp;dq=alice+de+janze+raymond+de+trafford&amp;hl=en"Weds Man She Shot", ''The Evening Independent'', 20 February 1932]&lt;/ref&gt; and spoke of buying a house in London.&lt;ref name="laurajames.typepad.com" /&gt; Alice commented on her affair with de Trafford: "We were deeply in love. It was arranged that we should marry".,&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=UY0vAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=6tsFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6639,6205400&amp;dq=alice+de+trafford&amp;hl=en "News and Views of Recent Events in the British Isles", ''The Ottawa Citizen'', p. 21, 23 June 1939]&lt;/ref&gt; although it has been suggested that Alice literally pursued de Trafford for three years before she finally got him to marry her.&lt;ref name="ReferenceK" /&gt;

During this time Alice, who now had severe financial reversals, took over the management of a gown shop in Paris under the firm name of "Gloria Bocher", but soon lost both interest and money in the venture.&lt;ref name="ReferenceE" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceK" /&gt; Her marriage also rapidly collapsed, ending only three months after the wedding&lt;ref&gt;Osborne, Frances (2009). ''The Bolter'', p. 189. Knopf&lt;/ref&gt; when the couple got into a heated argument in the compartment of an English railroad train over their honeymoon destination. Alice confided to de Trafford that she had purchased the cottage in Happy Valley where they used to rendezvous at the start of their affair,&lt;ref name="ReferenceL" /&gt; deciding that it would be perfect for their honeymoon.  The idea that did not appeal to her new husband; during the course of the argument, Alice absent-mindedly reached into her purse, prompting a terrified de Trafford to flee, fearing a new murder attempt. Alice later claimed she had no pistol in her purse, nor had she the intention of shooting him, but instead wanted to powder her nose.&lt;ref name="ReferenceK" /&gt;

Alice officially sought a divorce in November 1932, charging Raymond, who had fled to Australia, with cruelty and desertion.&lt;ref name="ReferenceG"&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=LQsaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Mg0EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6267,2982036&amp;dq=alice+de+janze&amp;hl=en "Chased Him 3 Years to Marry – Chased Him 3 Years to Divorce", ''The Milwaukee Sentinel'', 16 September 1934]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Asks Paris Divorce from de Trafford", ''The New York Times'', 19 November 1932&lt;/ref&gt; It took her two years to obtain his signature, and the divorce procedure was reported to begin on September 1934, but did not go forward.&lt;ref name="ReferenceG" /&gt; Alice may have changed her mind, but she again officially filed for divorce on May 1937,&lt;ref&gt;"Divorce Suit Filed in London", ''Chicago Daily Tribune'', 22 May 1937&lt;/ref&gt; winning an uncontested suit and a grant of [[decree nisi]] on the grounds of adultery with an unnamed correspondent at a London hotel.&lt;ref name="ReferenceK" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceG" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=towjAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=9ZgFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4338,3224485&amp;dq=alice+silverthorne&amp;hl=en "Decree Nisi Granted", ''The Montreal Gazette'', 26 October 1937]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the divorce, Alice considered permanently returning to Chicago, but friends advised her against it, pointing out how the shooting scandal had made her a "marked woman" in her native land.&lt;ref name="ReferenceE" /&gt; Accepting her notoriety, Alice returned to the world of '[[Happy Valley, Kenya|Happy Valley]]', where she permanently settled in the large farmhouse she had previously bought in [[Gilgil]], located on the banks of River Wanjohi.&lt;ref name="ReferenceK" /&gt; She spent the following years reading and taking care of her animals, which included lions, panthers and antelopes. She also became heavily addicted to drugs, particularly [[morphine]].&lt;ref&gt;Osborne, Frances (2009). ''The Bolter'', p. 213. Knopf&lt;/ref&gt; She was avoided by certain members of the community due to her rapid mood swings and the shooting incident; her friend, aviator [[Beryl Markham]], later disclosed: "Loneliness fixed Alice. Everyone was frightened of her".&lt;ref name="ReferenceQ"&gt;''White Mischief'', p. 193&lt;/ref&gt;

Alice now only rarely visited her children in France. Years later, Nolwén would state that she did not feel bitterness or hostility for her mother during their brief meetings, but would actually be fascinated by this virtually unknown woman who brought with her an air of mystique, owing to her permanent stay in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;''White Mischief'', p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

==1941: The Lord Erroll murder==
On 24 January 1941, [[Josslyn Hay, 22nd Earl of Erroll|Lord Erroll]] was found shot to death in his car, at an intersection outside [[Nairobi]].  Errol's serial philandering contributed to the persistent rumor that the perpetrator was a woman.&lt;ref&gt;''The Life and Death of Lord Erroll'', p. 237&lt;/ref&gt;  Police duly interrogated all of Erroll's closest acquaintances, including Alice. Although she had an alibi because she had spent an intimate night with Dickie Pembroke, another Happy Valley resident, due to her drug habits, her romantic attachment to Errol, and her previous attempt to kill a paramour,&lt;ref&gt;''White Mischief'', p. 144, 159–160&lt;/ref&gt; she was immediately regarded as the [[prime suspect]] among the [[White people in Kenya|white community]] of Happy Valley. It was also rumoured that Alice had attempted suicide on hearing the news of Erroll's death.&lt;ref name="ReferenceI" /&gt;

On the morning after Erroll's body was discovered, de Janzé went to the morgue with a friend to see his body. According to eyewitnesses, Alice stunned those in attendance by leaving a tree branch on Erroll's corpse, and whispering the words: "Now you are mine forever". Eyewitness and close friend Julian Lezzard suspected that Alice was the murderer, since it fitted with her morbid preoccupations;&lt;ref name="ReferenceQ" /&gt; it was even rumoured that Alice herself had admitted to the killing.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Collins (2003). ''A Question of Evidence: The Casebook of Great Forensic Controversies, from Napoleon to O.J.'', p. 88. Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. {{ISBN|978-0-471-46268-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his investigative book, ''White Mischief'', journalist [[James Fox (journalist)|James Fox]] mentions a suspicious incident regarding Alice and her possible connection to the crime. A few months after the murder, Alice went away for a few days and asked a neighbour to look after her house. In her absence, one of Alice's houseboys came to the neighbour, and produced a revolver, which he claimed he had found by a bridge, under a pile of stones on Alice's land.&lt;ref&gt;''White Mischief'', p. 144&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1941, British aristocrat [[Jock Delves Broughton|Sir Henry John "Jock" Delves Broughton]] was officially charged with Lord Erroll's murder.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=oVgbAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ZEwEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3915,1871142&amp;dq=delves+broughton+charged&amp;hl=en "Leader of British Society Named on Murder Charge", ''The Pittsburgh Press'', p. 18, 11 March 1941]&lt;/ref&gt; Delves Broughton had been aware of a passionate love affair between his young wife, Diana, and Erroll, in the months before his murder.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=pgMvAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=1dsFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3781,4597200&amp;dq=delves+broughton+trial&amp;hl=en "Sir D.

Paul Spicer theorizes that Alice was the real murderer of Lord Erroll, based on several letters that Alice's personal doctor and former lover, William Boyle, discovered in her house on the day of her death, and later handed over to the police.

==Death==
[[File:Alice de Janzé.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Article reporting Alice's sudden death in ''The Vidette Messenger'']]
In August 1941, after being diagnosed with [[uterine cancer]], Alice underwent a [[hysterectomy]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceR" /&gt; On 23 September, she attempted suicide by taking an overdose of [[pentobarbital]]. When her friend, Patricia Bowles, discovered her, she had already marked every piece of furniture with the name of the friend who would inherit it. Bowles rescued Alice by calling a doctor to [[gastric lavage|pump her stomach]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceR"&gt;''White Mischief'', p. 216&lt;/ref&gt;

A week later, on 30 September, two days after turning 42, she finally succeeded in ending her life. A servant found her dead on her bed from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, from the same weapon she had once used on Raymond and herself.&lt;ref name="ReferenceL" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"An Ex-Countess Shot Found Dead", ''The New York Times'', 1 October 1941&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Kilian, who has written extensively about Alice's life, believes that she chose suicide because she became depressed about her aging appearance and loss of looks.&lt;ref&gt;Kilian, Michael. "Vainest Woman Met Museum of Art Exhibit Shows 'La Divine Comtesse' in her Glory", ''Chicago Tribune'', 2 November 2000&lt;/ref&gt;  It was not the first suicide in her family: her cousin, John Hellyer Silverthorne had also committed suicide by gunshot in his home in Chicago in 1933, at the age of 26.&lt;ref&gt;"Young Society Husband Kills Himself in Home", ''Chicago Tribune'', 24 January 1933&lt;/ref&gt;

Alice left three suicide notes, one addressed to the police, one to her daughters and one to Dickie Pembroke. The content of the letters was never publicly disclosed, fueling rumours that they containing revelations into the Errol murder. A government official, summoned to examine her possessions, was reportedly dumbfounded when he came across the letters. After a long, secret meeting among officials, it was decided that the content of her papers and letters would not be made public.&lt;ref name="ReferenceE" /&gt; What did become known is that she had requested that her friends hold a cocktail party on her grave.&lt;ref name="ReferenceR" /&gt;

On 21 January 1942, following an inquest in Nairobi, her death was officially ruled a suicide; the finding was delayed due to the difficulty in obtaining evidence. The coroner also concluded there was no sign of insanity,&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=--4ZAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=8SIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5662,2190976&amp;dq=frederic+de+janze&amp;hl=en "Verdict of Suicide Returned in Death of Armour Niece", ''The Milwaukee Journal'', 21 January 1942]&lt;/ref&gt; but he further fuelled the conspiracy theories by stating that the content of Alice's letters were such as to merit their being destroyed, because they constituted damaging revelations of a social and political nature.&lt;ref name="ReferenceE" /&gt;

[[File:Sarahmiles.jpg|thumb|left|400px|Sarah Miles portraying Alice de Janzé in ''White Mischief'' (1988)]] In 1982, Alice de Janzé's life was prominently featured in the investigative non-fiction book ''White Mischief'' by journalist [[James Fox (journalist)|James Fox]], which examined the events surrounding the murder of Lord Erroll, the Happy Valley set, and their notorious life before and after the event.  In 1988, the book was made into an eponymous film, directed by [[Michael Radford]], in which Alice de Janzé was portrayed by British actress [[Sarah Miles]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094317/ Internet Movie Database entry for ''White Mischief'']&lt;/ref&gt; Radford was reportedly drawn to the story primarily due to an incident attributed to Alice, in which she had once flung open the shutters of her window in her house in Kenya and remarked: "Oh, God. Not another fucking beautiful day." Radford incorporated this scene into the film.&lt;ref&gt;''The Washington Post'', 23 May 1988. Battiata, Mary. "John Hurt into Africa; After Making ''Mischief'' in Kenya, The Actor Enjoys His New Domicile"&lt;/ref&gt;

The film adaptation makes much of de Janzé's eccentricities, including scenes in which she watches a polo match with a snake twined around her shoulders, or doses herself with a syringe of morphine in the ladies' toilet.&lt;ref name="Gross"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/22/movies/new-york-two-new-movies-suggest-that-shock-tactics-are-best-muted-work-art.html?pagewanted=all ''The New York Times'', 22 May 1988. Gross, John. "Two New Movies Suggest that Shock Tactics are Best Muted In a Work of Art"]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, Miles stated at the Cannes Film Festival that as an actress de Janzé was a difficult character for her to portray. When she first arrived in Kenya, Miles sought people who knew Alice but was unable to learn anything substantial due to those acquaintances' confused perceptions of de Janzé; some were even uncertain as to her true nationality.&lt;ref name="ReferenceM"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/29/movies/at-the-movies.html ''The New York Times'', 29 April 1988. van Gelder, Lawrence.

''Dance on a Sinking Ship''. Bantam, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; and included her as a character in another novel of historical fiction ''Sinful Safari'' (2003) in which various members of the Happy Valley set, including Alice, are suspects in a fictional murder case in 1920s Kenya.&lt;ref&gt;Kilian, Michael (2003). ''Sinful Safari''. Berkley, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Paul Di Filippo]] based Alice and several other members of the Happy Valley set as the protagonists in his fictional story "The Happy Valley at the End of the World", part of his collection, ''Lost Pages'' (1998).&lt;ref&gt;Di Filippo, Paul (1998).

'''Anthonie (Antoon) Cornelis Oudemans Jzn''' (November 12, 1858 – January 14, 1943) was a Dutch [[zoologist]].&lt;ref&gt;This minibiography is based on: Eindhoven G. L. van (1943). [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/119653#page/95/mode/1up "In memoriam Dr. A. C. Oudemans"]. Tijdschrift voor Entomologie 86: 1–56.&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]], [[Dutch East Indies]], he was the son of the noted Dutch astronomer [[Jean Abraham Chrétien Oudemans]] and the grandson of the Dutch educator, poet and philologist Anthonie Cornelis Oudemans Sr., after whom he was named. He often used the patronymic "Jzn" (for ''Jeanzoon'') in his publications.

He wrote his [[dissertation]] on [[ribbon worm]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Bijdrage tot de kennis van het bloedvaatstelsel en de nephridia der Nemertinen. Proefschrift ter verkrijging van den graad van Doctor in de Planten Dierkunde aan de Rijks-Universiteit te Utrecht. Utrecht, P. W. van de Weijer, p. 1–114, Pl. I–III, f. 1–75.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1885 was appointed director of the Royal Zoological Gardens at [[The Hague]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zoonews.ws/IZN/317/IZN-317.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2004-12-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041214164346/http://www.zoonews.ws/IZN/317/IZN-317.htm |archivedate=2004-12-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is credited with the discovery of several insect and a primate species, the [[black crested mangabey]].

1892 saw the publication of Oudeman's ''The Great Sea Serpent'', a study of the many [[sea serpent]] reports from the world's oceans. Oudemans concluded that such creatures might be a previously unknown large [[Pinniped|seal]], which he dubbed ''Megophias megophias''. Reception of the volume has been described as respectful but "cold". [[Bernard Heuvelmans]] later suggested that ''The Great Sea Serpent'' was the root of [[cryptozoology]].

In 1917 he published ''Dodo-studiën: naar aanleiding van de vondst van een gevelsteen met dodo-beeld van 1561 te Vere'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/dodostudinnaar00oude |title=Dodo-studiën.

In 1895, Oudemans left The Hague to teach [[biology]] in the Frisian city of [[Sneek]]. He published several scientific articles in later years. He had married Helena Johanna van de Velde in 1887, but became a widower, and remarried to Aletta Amelia Louise Pilgrim in 1919.

In 1942 he donated the [[Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie]] his important collection of [[mites]] ([[Acari]]). This collection numbers 5981 slides (1316 species).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Voorloopige Catalogus van de Acari in de Collectie-Oudemans |last = Buitendijk |first=A.M. | year=1945 | journal= [[Zoologische Mededelingen]] | volume=24 | pages=281–391|url=http://www.repository.naturalis.nl/document/149542}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his death, the accompanying drawings were bequeathed to the museum as well.

Oudemans died in Arnhem in 1943.

'''Beibulat Taimin''' (1779-1831) was a [[Chechen people|Chechen]] military and political leader, who led rebellions against Russian expansion in the [[North Caucasus]] but also developed diplomatic relations with the Russians. In Chechen folklore he is remembered as a figure of outstanding courage.

==Historical role==
Beibulat Taimiev is an important figure in the history of resistance to colonialism in [[Chechnya]],&lt;ref name="Gould2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rebecca Ruth Gould|title=Writers and Rebels: The Literature of Insurgency in the Caucasus|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JtroDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA50|year=2016|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-20064-5|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; described as Chechnya's "greatest and most famous war leader"&lt;ref name="Tütüncü1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mehmet Tütüncü|title=Caucasus, war and peace: the new world disorder in Caucasia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m5XtAAAAMAAJ|year=1998|publisher=SOTA|isbn=978-90-90-11125-4|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the Russian poet [[Alexandr Pushkin]] as "The renowned Beibulat, the most feared man in the [[Caucasus]]".&lt;ref name="Пушкин1974"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alexandr Pushkin|title=A Journey to Arzrum|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WVZpAAAAMAAJ|year=1974|publisher=Ardis|isbn=978-0-88233-068-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; He may well be considered also as the first Chechen diplomat for his negotiating efforts at the height of armed clashes between mountaineers and regular troops. Taimiev was a flexible politician and diplomat. He wanted good neighbourly relations between his people and the people of Russia, so he aimed at reconciling the interests of the two and called for peace talks. To this end, Taimiev often met with the tsar’s commissioner in the North Caucasus, General [[Aleksey Petrovich Yermolov|Yermolov]]. He established diplomatic contacts with Iran and Turkey and went to visit the countries personally.

Many historians{{who|date=February 2017}} say the role of Taimiev in the political life of the North Caucasus in the first three decades of the 19th century was that of the leader of rebellions by Chechen and [[Ingush people|Ingush]] people. Among the uprisings that he led against the Russians was that in the name of Islam in 1825.&lt;ref name="Motadel2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Motadel|title=Islam and the European Empires|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=__5-BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT262|date=4 September 2014|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-103026-0|page=262}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he used his position to prevent revolts by mountaineers from turning into bloodshed and robbery. Taking the command of the mutinies Taimiev never stopped his diplomatic activity. The circumstances of his death remain unclear, and there is a possibility that Taimiev was eliminated by more radically minded associates.

The political activity of Taimiev lasted for 30 years. Sympathizing with his views, his struggle for independence and fair relations with Russia were Pushkin, [[Alexandr Griboyedov]], the Decembrists, and later [[Mikhail Lermontov]] and [[Leo Tolstoy]]. 

==In folklore==
Though a real historical figure, Beibulat Taimiev is also a leading character of Chechen folklore. In poems and songs he is depicted as a legendary dare-devil. In oral narrative the name of Beibulat is associated with courage or reckless boldness.

'''William Charles Harrelson''' (born November 17, 1945) is a former professional [[baseball]] player who played one season for the [[California Angels]] of [[Major League Baseball]]. During his playing days, he stood at 6' 5" and weighed 215&amp;nbsp;lbs.&lt;ref name="statistics"&gt;[https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/h/harrebi02.shtml "Bill Harrelson Statistics and History"].

Harrelson, a "full blooded [[Cherokee]] Indian,"&lt;ref name="debut"&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0J0zAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=3TIHAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5448,2551341&amp;dq=bill-harrelson&amp;hl=en "Angels Lose Two Games To Athletics"]. ''Lodi News-Sentinel'', August 1, 1968, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; was born in [[Tahlequah, Oklahoma]]. In 1964, he was signed by the Angels and began his professional baseball career that season. He played in the [[Pioneer League (baseball)|Pioneer League]], [[California League]], and [[Midwest League]] in 1964 and 1965 but had little success. In 1966, Harrelson went 8-11 with a 3.31 [[earned run average]] in the [[New York–Penn League]]; in 1967, he had his best season, going 7-4 with a 2.48 ERA for the California League's [[San Jose Bees]].&lt;ref name="minors"&gt;[https://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/player.cgi?id=harrel004wil "Bill Harrelson Minor League Statistics &amp; History"]. ''baseball-reference.com''. Retrieved 2010-12-04.&lt;/ref&gt; That performance got him promoted to Class AA, Class AAA, and finally the majors in 1968.

Harrelson made his major league debut with the Angels on July 31, 1968. He was involved in a pitching duel with future Hall of Famer [[Catfish Hunter]] that day,&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=06pIAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=UAENAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=993,3369975&amp;dq=bill-harrelson+catfish&amp;hl=en "Tigers Keeping Their Distance"]. ''Meridan Journal'', August 1, 1968, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; both allowing just one run through seven innings. Harrelson gave up just four hits, all singles, through seven, but he weakened in the eighth and eventually took the loss.&lt;ref name="debut"/&gt; Things didn't get much better for him, as he went 1-6 with a 5.08 ERA over the next two months. He made his final major league appearance on September 18.&lt;ref name="statistics"/&gt;

In 1969, Harrelson returned to the minors and played in the [[Texas League]] and [[Pacific Coast League]]. On January 14, 1970, he was traded to the [[Cincinnati Reds]] organization, along with Dan Loomer, for [[Jack Fisher]].&lt;ref name="statistics"/&gt; Harrelson had losing records in the minors in both 1970 and 1971 before retiring from baseball.&lt;ref name="minors"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3533">[[File:Bolesław Piasecki.jpg|right|thumb|Bolesław Piasecki]]'''Bolesław Bogdan Piasecki''' (alias Leon Całka, Sablewski; born February 18, 1915 in [[Łódź]], died January 1, 1979 in [[Warsaw]]) was a [[Poland|Polish]] politician and writer.

In [[Second Polish Republic|interwar Poland]] he was one of the more prominent nationalist politicians, playing an important role in the leadership of [[National Radical Camp (1934)|Obóz Narodowo-Radykalny]].  
In 1934 he was interned in [[Bereza Kartuska]].  After his release, he became the leader of the illegal, extreme right faction [[National Radical Camp Falanga|ONR-Falanga]].  This organisation advocated "Catholic totalitarianism" and is considered by many to have been a fascist movement.

During the [[Second World War]] he fought in the [[Polish Underground]], leading the grouping [[Konfederacja Narodu]] (merged into the [[Armia Krajowa]] in 1943) and taking part in the fighting around [[Vilnius]].  Afterwards, he was arrested by the Soviet [[NKVD]], and in a drastic conversion from his previous stance began to cooperate with the Communist government in Poland.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.polityka.pl/archive/do/registry/secure/showArticle?id=3342382&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, in 1945, he cofounded and directed a so-called social progressive movement of lay Catholics, grouped around the weekly publication "[[Dziś i Jutro]]" (Today and Tomorrow). In 1947 he created the [[PAX Association]] and was the chairman of its governing body (until his death).  
After 1956, the importance of PAX diminished (and Piasecki's role along with it), though it remained a prominent organisation until 1989 and its successors still exist today.
{{Falangism sidebar}}
In later years, Piasecki was a member of the Polish [[Sejm]] from 1965, where he presided over the grouping of members associated with PAX.  In 1971-1979 he was a member of the [[Polish Council of State]].

'''Bracha Peli''' ({{lang-he|ברכה פלאי}})&amp;nbsp;(1892–1986) was the founder and owner of the [[Israel]]i publishing house, [[Massada Publishing Company|Massada]]. She was the driving force behind the publication of ''[[Encyclopaedia Hebraica]]'',&lt;ref name=obit&gt;Founder of the Hebrew Enterprise, Uri Dromi, accessed October 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and is credited with starting Israel's annual [[Hebrew Book Week]].&lt;ref name=book/&gt;

==Biography==
Bronya Kutzenok (later Bracha Peli) was born in Starovitzky, a small village in Russia, now [[Ukraine]]&lt;ref name=bracha&gt;[http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/peli-bracha Bracha Peli], Asher Weill, Jewish Women's Archive. accessed October 2009&lt;/ref&gt; to a family of [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic Jews]]. She was the eldest of seven children. Her father, Shmuel Kutzenok, was a wealthy lumber merchant who supplied timber for artillery wagons to the Russian army. Her mother, Sarah, ran the village general store. She acquired an education by overhearing her brothers' lessons.&lt;ref name="bracha"/&gt; Early on, she became proficient in Yiddish, Russian and Hebrew. In 1905, when she was about to study at a Gymnasium in [[Kiev]], pogroms against the Jews erupted, disrupting her plans. She waited two years to complete her secondary education and study economics.&lt;ref name=bracha/&gt;

In 1914, after her mother died of tuberculosis, Peli met a young [[Zionist]] teacher, Meir Pilipovetsky, whom she married against her family's wishes. After her son, [[Alexander Peli|Alexander]], was born she opened a Jewish secondary school that attracted 400 students in its first year.&lt;ref name=bracha/&gt;
[[File:Encyclopaedia Hebraica 2.JPG|thumb|Encyclopedia Hebraica]]
In July 1921, Peli and her husband left Russia for [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], settling in [[Tel Aviv]].&lt;ref name=bracha/&gt; In 1926, Peli opened a stall in Tel Aviv to sell books cheaply, which led to the inauguration of an annual event.&lt;ref name=book&gt;[http://www.jewish-theatre.com/visitor/article_display.aspx?articleID=700 Hebrew Book Week :from an open, urban fair into an entertainment festival] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031111846/http://www.jewish-theatre.com/visitor/article_display.aspx?articleID=700 |date=October 31, 2007 }}, Shiri Lev-Ari, Jewish Theatre, accessed October 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Today [[Hebrew Book Week]] is a national 10-day event.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frankfurt-book-fair.com/en/networking/search_find/book_markets/asia//israel/00023/ Israel - Book Production Data Economic situation], Frankfurt Book Fair, accessed October 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The Encyclopaedia Hebraica project began using Bracha Peli's publishing house in 1946 with her son, Alexander, supervising. The last volume was published in 1996.&lt;ref name=bracha/&gt;

Bracha Peli died in 1986.

{{Cantonese culture}}

The '''Cantonese people''' ({{zh|t=廣東人|s=广东人|cy=Gwóngdūng Yàhn|j=gwong2 dung1 jan4|labels=no}}, also {{zh|t=粵人|s=粤人|cy=Yuht Yàhn|j=jyut6 jan4|labels=no}}) are subgroup of the [[Han Chinese]] people native to and/or originating from the provinces of [[Guangdong]] and [[Guangxi]] (collectively known as [[Liangguang]]), in southern mainland [[China]]. Although more accurately, "Cantonese" refers only to the people from [[Guangzhou]] and its satellite cities and towns and/or native speakers of [[Standard Cantonese]], rather than simply and generally referring to the people of the Liangguang region. The Cantonese people share a common native [[Cantonese culture|culture]], history, [[Cultural heritage|ancestry]] and [[Cantonese language|language]]. The term "Cantonese people" is often synonymous with the [[Punti]] people ({{zh|c=本地人|j=bún déi yàhn|labels=no}}). They are also referred to as "[[Hoa people|Hoa]]" in Vietnam, "Kongfu" in Malaysia and "Konghu" in Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Chinese Overseas: Comparative Cultural Issues |authorlink= Chee Beng Tan |publisher=Hong Kong University Press |pages=92–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;".

Historically centered on and predominating the Pearl River Basin shared between Guangdong and Guangxi, the Cantonese people are also responsible for establishing their [[Cantonese language|native language]]'s usage in [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] during the early migrations within the [[British Hong Kong|British]] and [[Portuguese Macau|Portuguese]] colonial eras respectively. Today, [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] are the only regions in the world where Cantonese is the official spoken language, with the mixed influences of English and Portuguese respectively. Cantonese is traditionally and remains today a majority language in Guangdong and Guangxi, despite the increasing influence of Mandarin. There are currently around 9 million Cantonese speakers overseas.&lt;ref&gt;Yangchen Wanbao 2008&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Taishanese people]] may also be considered Cantonese but speak a dinstict variation of Yue Chinese [[Taishanese]].

There have been a number of influential Cantonese figures throughout history, such as [[Yuan Chonghuan]], [[Bruce Lee]], [[Liang Qichao]], [[Sun Yat-Sen]], [[Lee Shau-kee]], [[Ho Ching]] and [[Flossie Wong-Staal]].

==Terminology==
"Cantonese" has been generally used to describe all Chinese people from Guangdong since "Cantonese" is commonly treated as a synonym with "Guangdong" and the Cantonese language is treated as the sole language of the region. The English name "Canton" derived from [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''{{lang|pt|Cantão}}''&lt;ref name=hj/&gt; or ''{{lang|pt|Cidade de Cantão}}'',&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Santa Barbara Portuguese Studies, ''Vols. I–II'' |date=1994 |p=256 |publisher=Jorge de Sena Center for Portuguese Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt; a muddling of [[dialects of Chinese|dialectical]] pronunciations of "[[Guangdong]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=T'ien Hsia Monthly, ''Vol. VIII'' |p=426 |date=1939 |publisher=Sun Yat-sen Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TAnheeIPcAEC&amp;pg=PA181 |contribution=Can·ton·ese |title=Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, ''11th ed.'' |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TAnheeIPcAEC |location=[[Springfield, Mass.|Springfield]] |publisher=Merriam-Webster}}&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g., [[Hakka]] ''Kóng-tûng''). Although it originally and chiefly applied to the walled city of Guangzhou, it was occasionally conflated with [[Guangdong]] by some authors.{{refn|The lexicographer only accepted Canton as a proper noun referring to the city, and considered usages with reference to the province as an “ellipsis”, see [[Henry Yule|Yule]] &amp; al.&lt;ref name=hj&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F51h6q-bB6sC&amp;printsec=frontcover |last=Yule |first=Henry |authorlink=Henry Yule |author2=A.C. Burnell |title=Hobson-Jobson: The Definitive Glossary of British India |publisher=reprinted by Oxford University Press, 2013 |editor=Kate Teltscher |at="[https://books.google.com/books?id=F51h6q-bB6sC&amp;pg=PA127 Canton]"}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{refn|A. Hamilton (1727) used Canton to refer to both the city and the province. But he used Canton for the city more frequently in the same work, especially when he wrote Canton without reference to “Quangtung”. See  see [[Alexander Hamilton (sailor)|Hamilton]] (1727; pp.224-238) &lt;ref name=Ahm&gt;{{citation |url=https://archive.org/details/anewaccounteast00hamigoog/page/n251 |last=Hamilton |first=Alexander |authorlink=Alexander Hamilton|title= A New Account of the East Indies: Giving an Exact and Copious Description of the Situation|publisher=reprinted by Oxford University Press, 2013 |editor=Kate Teltscher |at="[https://archive.org/details/anewaccounteast00hamigoog/page/n251]"}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}   This is inaccurate as "Canton" itself technically only refers to Guangdong's capital [[Guangzhou]] and the Cantonese language specifically refers to only the Guangzhou dialect of the [[Yue Chinese]] languages.

Within Guangdong and Guangxi, Cantonese is considered the [[Prestige (sociolinguistics)|prestige dialect]] and is called ''baahk wá'' {{IPA-yue|pàːk wǎː|}} ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|白話}}}}) which means "vernacular". In historical times, it was known as "Guangzhou speech" or Guangzhounese (廣州話; 广州话; Gwóngjāu wá) but due to Guangzhou's prosperity it has led people to conflate it with all Yue languages and many now refer to "Guangzhou speech" as simply "Guangdong speech" (廣東話; 广东话; Gwóngdūng wá). Similar cases where entire Chinese language families are thought to be a single language occur with non-specialists, conflating all [[Wu Chinese]] languages as just [[Shanghainese language|Shanghainese]] and its different forms, as it is the prestige dialect (although historically [[Suzhounese]] was), or that [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] only refers to the [[Beijing dialect|Beijing]]-based [[Standard Chinese]] and that it is a single language rather than a large group of related varieties.

There are many other Chinese languages spoken by the [[Han Chinese]] in these areas. In Guangxi, [[Southwestern Mandarin]] is spoken as are other [[Yue Chinese]] languages apart from Cantonese. In Guangdong, aside from other Yue Chinese languages, these non-Cantonese languages include [[Hakka]], [[Chaoshan dialect|Chaoshan]], [[Leizhou Min]], [[Shaozhou Tuhua|Tuhua]]. Non-Cantonese speaking Yue peoples are sometimes labelled as "Cantonese" such as the [[Taishanese people]] ({{zh|c=四邑粵人|j=sei yāp yuht yàhn|labels=no}}), even though [[Taishanese]] (台山話) has low intelligibility to [[Standard Cantonese]]. Some literature uses neutral terminology such as '''Guangdongnese''' and '''Guangxinese''' to refer to people from these provinces without the cultural or linguistic affiliations to Cantonese.

== History ==

=== Pre-19th century: History of Liangguang ===
{{Further|Nanyue|Southward expansion of the Han Dynasty}}
[[File:Nam-Viet 200bc.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Nanyue (Nàhm Yuht) Kingdom.]]

Until the 19th century, Cantonese history was largely the history of [[Guangdong]] and [[Guangxi]] provinces. What is now Guangdong, and later Guangxi, was first brought under [[Qin dynasty|Qin influence]] by a general named [[Zhao Tuo]], who later founded the kingdom of [[Nanyue]] in 204 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Sima Qian, ''Records of the Grand Historian'', section 112.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Huai Nan Zi'', section 18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zhang &amp; Huang, pp. 26–31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zhang and Huang, pp. 196–200; also ''Shi Ji'' 130&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ctext.org/shiji/li-sheng-lu--lie-zhuan#n8359 Records of the Grand Historian, section 97] 《《史記·酈生陸賈列傳》&lt;/ref&gt; The Nanyue kingdom went on to become the strongest [[Baiyue]] state in China, with many neighboring kingdoms declaring their allegiance to Nanyue rule. Zhao Tuo took the [[Han dynasty|Han]] territory of [[Hunan]] and defeated the [[Han dynasty]]'s first attack on Nanyue, later annexing the kingdom of [[Minyue]] in the East and conquering [[Âu Lạc]], Northern Vietnam, in the West in 179 BC.&lt;ref name="Chapius-02"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jskyi00bspcC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;dq=%22au+viet%22+%22xi+ou%22&amp;sig=ACfU3U27CLo28r4xTtw6Fn2QigI86SngQg|title=A History of Vietnam: From Hong Bang to Tu Duc|last=Chapuis|first=Oscar|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=1995|isbn=0-313-29622-7|location=|pages=13–14|authorlink=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The greatly expanded Nanyue kingdom included the territories of modern-day [[Guangdong]], [[Guangxi]] and [[Northern Vietnam]] (Annam), with the capital situated at modern-day [[Guangzhou]]. The native peoples of Liangguang remained under Baiyue control until the [[Han dynasty]] in 111 BC, following the [[Han–Nanyue War]]. However, it was not until subsequent dynasties such as the [[Jin Dynasty (265-420)|Jin Dynasty]], the [[Tang Dynasty]] and the [[Song Dynasty]] that major waves of Han Chinese began to migrate south into Guangdong and Guangxi. Waves of migration and subsequent intermarriage meant that existing populations of both provinces were displaced, but some native groups like the [[Zhuang people|Zhuangs]] still remained. The Cantonese often call themselves "people of Tang" ({{zh|c=唐人|j=tòhng yàhn|labels=no}}). This is because of the inter-mixture between native and Han immigrants in Guangdong and Guangxi reached a critical mass of acculturation during the Tang dynasty, creating a new local identity among the Liangguang peoples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ramsey |first=S. Robert |title=The Languages of China |year=1987 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=0-691-06694-9 |pages=98–99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 4th–12th centuries, [[Han Chinese]] people from [[North China]]'s [[Yellow River]] delta migrated and settled in the South of China. This gave rise to peoples including the Cantonese themselves, [[Hakka people|Hakkas]] and [[Hoklo people|Hoklos]], whose ancestors migrated from [[Henan]] and [[Shandong]], to areas of southeastern coastal China such as [[Chaozhou]], [[Quanzhou]] and [[Zhangzhou]] and other parts of Guangdong during the [[Tang dynasty]].&lt;ref name="LeongWright1997"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6qeC_0u3pLIC&amp;pg=PA78#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Migration and Ethnicity in Chinese History: Hakkas, Pengmin, and Their Neighbors|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=1997|isbn=978-0-8047-2857-7|pages=78–|author1=Sow-Theng Leong|author2=Tim Wright|author3=George William Skinner}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been multiple migrations of Han people into Southeastern and Southern China throughout history.&lt;ref name="Gernet1996-02"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jqb7L-pKCV8C&amp;pg=PA8&amp;dq=On+the+other+hand,+the+diversity+of+the+southern+and+south-eastern+dialects,+and+also+the+archaic+character+of+several+of+them,+bears+witness+to+the+relative+stability+of+the+peoples+established+in+these+regions&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=XJM8VJaPNvPhsAT24YDwDw&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=On%20the%20other%20hand%2C%20the%20diversity%20of%20the%20southern%20and%20south-eastern%20dialects%2C%20and%20also%20the%20archaic%20character%20of%20several%20of%20them%2C%20bears%20witness%20to%20the%20relative%20stability%20of%20the%20peoples%20established%20in%20these%20regions&amp;f=false|title=A History of Chinese Civilization|date=31 May 1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-49781-7|pages=8–|author=Jacques Gernet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of the Cantonese people is thus said to be Northern Chinese peoples that migrated to Guangdong and Guangxi while it was still inhabited by [[Baiyue]] peoples.&lt;ref name="EisenstadtSchluchter"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0DPEol7HO3gC&amp;pg=PA213#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Public Spheres and Collective Identities|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=978-1-4128-3248-9|pages=213–4|author1=Shmuel Noah Eisenstadt|author2=Wolfgang Schluchter|author3=Björn Wittrock}}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[Wang Mang]]'s reign in the [[Han dynasty]] (206BC-220AD), there were influxes of Han Chinese migrants into Guangdong and Guangxi, western coast of Hainan, Annam (now Northern Vietnam) and eastern Yunnan.&lt;ref name="Gernet1996-01"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jqb7L-pKCV8C&amp;pg=PA126&amp;dq=At+the+time+of+the+troubles+which+marked+the+reign+of+Wang+Mang+(9-23)+and+the+first+years+of+the+Han+restoration,+Chinese+emigration+to+Yunnan,+Kwangtung+and+north+and+central+Vietnam+increased+considerably.+...&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=8wd5TqOiOcHv0gHxmtTrDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=At%20the%20time%20of%20the%20troubles%20which%20marked%20the%20reign%20of%20Wang%20Mang%20(9-23)%20and%20the%20first%20years%20of%20the%20Han%20restoration%2C%20Chinese%20emigration%20to%20Yunnan%2C%20Kwangtung%20and%20north%20and%20central%20Vietnam%20increased%20considerably.%20...&amp;f=false|title=A History of Chinese Civilization|date=31 May 1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-49781-7|pages=126–|author=Jacques Gernet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 19th–20th century: Turmoil and migration ===

Names of shops are in Cantonese and there are four daily newspapers printed in the Cantonese language at that time, as there is already significant number of Cantonese people who have been there for generations.]]

During the early 1800s, conflict occurred between Cantonese and Portuguese pirates in the form of the [[Ningpo massacre]] after the defeat of Portuguese pirates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LP9q1dzVRYQC&amp;pg=PA67&amp;dq=they+were+destroyed+in+Ningbo+by+a+fleet+of+Chinese+pirates+with+the+support+of+the+local+Chinese+government+and+other+Europeans.&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=hom5TqiXGsGysAL-ieTCCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=they%20were%20destroyed%20in%20Ningbo%20by%20a%20fleet%20of%20Chinese%20pirates%20with%20the%20support%20of%20the%20local%20Chinese%20government%20and%20other%20Europeans.&amp;f=false|title=Macau History and Society|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|year=2011|isbn=988-8028-54-5|edition=illustrated|volume=|location=|page=67|quote=There was indeed a group of Portuguese who became pirates, called "Macau ruffians," or policemen who turned bad, along with "Manila-men" from the Philippines and escaped African slaves. Their fleet attacked "the Cantonese ships when they could get them at an advantage, and murdered their crews with circumstances of great atrocity."55 They were destroyed in Ningbo by a fleet of Chinese pirates with the support of the local Chinese government and other Europeans.|author=Zhidong Hao|editor=|accessdate=4 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[First Opium War|First]] (1839{{ndash}}1842) and [[Second Opium War]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s (1856{{ndash}}1860) led to the loss of China's control over [[Hong Kong]] and [[Kowloon]], which were ceded to the [[British Empire]]. [[Macau]] also became a [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese settlement]]. Between 1855 and 1867, the [[Punti-Hakka Clan Wars]] caused further discord in Guangdong and Guangxi. The [[third plague pandemic]] of 1855 broke out in [[Yunnan]] and spread to the Liangguang region via Guangxi, killing thousands and spreading via water traffic to nearby Hong Kong and Macau.

The turmoil of the 19th century, followed by the political upheaval of the early 20th century, compelled many residents of Guangdong to migrate overseas in search of a better future. Up until the second half of the 20th century, the majority of [[overseas Chinese]] emigrated from two provinces of China; Guangdong and [[Fujian]]. As a result, there are today many Cantonese communities throughout the world, including in [[Southeast Asia]], the [[Pacific Islands]], the [[Americas]], the [[Caribbean]] and [[Western Europe]], with [[Chinatown]]s commonly being established by Cantonese communities. There have been a large number of [[interracial marriage]]s between Cantonese men and women from other nations, as most of the Cantonese migrants were men. As a result, there are many [[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)|Eurasians]] with Cantonese ancestry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacu.org/ukchinese.html|title=UK Chinese|publisher=|accessdate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example [[Nancy Kwan]], born to a Cantonese father and Scottish mother, is a well-known Hollywood actress in the 1960s; and influential martial artist [[Bruce Lee]], who was born to a Cantonese father and a half-Chinese, half-Caucasian mother.

Unlike the migrants from [[Fujian]], who mostly settled in [[Southeast Asia]], many Cantonese emigrants also migrated to the [[Western Hemisphere]], particularly the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]. Many Cantonese immigrants into the United States became railroad labourers, while many in South America were brought in as [[coolie]]s. Cantonese immigrants in the United States and Australia participated in the [[California Gold Rush]] and the [[Australian gold rushes]] of 1854 onwards, while [[Chinese immigration to Hawaii|those in Hawaii]] found employment in sugarcane plantations as contract labourers. These early immigrants variously faced hostility and a variety of discriminatory laws, including the prohibition of Chinese female immigrants. The relaxation of immigration laws after [[World War II]] allowed for subsequent waves of migration to the Western world from southeastern [[mainland China]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]]. As a result, Cantonese continues to be widely used by Chinese communities of Guangdong, Guangxi, Hong Kong and Macau regional origin in the Western hemisphere, and has not been supplanted by the [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]-based [[Standard Chinese]]. A large proportion of the early migrants also came from the [[Siyi]] region of Guangdong and spoke [[Taishanese]]. The Taishanese variant is still spoken in American-Chinese communities, by the older population as well as by more recent immigrants from Taishan, in [[Jiangmen]], Guangdong.

=== Cantonese influence on the Xinhai Revolution ===
The [[Xinhai Revolution]] of 1911 was a revolution that overthrew the last imperial dynasty of China, the [[Qing dynasty]], and established the [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republic of China]]. Guangdong's uprising against the Qing dynasty in 1895 let to its naming as the "cradle of the Xinhai Revolution".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Nation_Governance_and_Modernity_in_China.html?id=HWlGcgdUBhkC&amp;redir_esc=y|title=Nation, Governance, and Modernity in China|publisher=|accessdate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Langmead"&gt;Langmead, Donald.

== Cultural hub ==
[[File:CANTONESE GENTLEMEN 2.jpg|thumb|upright|right|A Cantonese gentleman in Qing-era traditional attire, circa 1873–1874.]]
Cantonese people and their culture are centered in [[Guangdong]], eastern [[Guangxi]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]].

[[Guangzhou]] (formerly known as Canton), the capital city of Guangdong, has been one of China's international trading ports since the [[Tang dynasty]]. During the 18th century, it became an important centre of the emerging trade between China and the Western world, as part of the [[Canton System]]. The privilege during this period made Guangzhou one of the top three cities in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geography.about.com/library/weekly/aa011201e.htm |title=Top 10 Cities of the Year 1800 |publisher=About.com |accessdate=2008-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Operating from the [[Thirteen Factories]] located on the banks of the [[Pearl River (China)|Pearl River]] outside Canton, merchants traded goods such as [[silk]], [[porcelain]] ("fine china"), and [[tea]], allowing Guangzhou to become a prosperous city. Links to overseas contacts and beneficial tax reforms in the 1990s have also contributed to the city's ongoing growth. Guangzhou was named a [[global city]] in 2008. The migrant population from other provinces of China in Guangzhou was 40 percent of the city's total population in 2008. Most of them are rural migrants and they speak only Mandarin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/jul/25/protesters-guangzhou-protect-cantonese |location=London |work=The Guardian  |title=Protesters gather in Guangzhou to protect Cantonese language |first=Tania |last=Branigan |date=2010-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hong Kong and Macau are two of the [[List of cities by GDP|richest cities in the world in terms of GDP per capita]] and are autonomous [[Special administrative regions of China|SAR]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s (Special Administrative Regions) that are under independent governance from China. Historically governed by the [[British Empire|British]] and [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] empires respectively, colonial Hong Kong and Macau were increasingly populated by migrant influxes from mainland China, particularly the nearby Guangdong Province. For that reason, the culture of Hong Kong and Macau became a mixture of Cantonese and Western influences, sometimes described as "East meets West".

=== Hong Kong ===
[[Hong Kong Island]] was first colonised by the [[British Empire]] in 1842 with a population of only 7,450; however, it was in 1898 that Hong Kong truly became a [[Crown colony|British colony]], when the British also colonised the [[New Territories]] (which constitute 86.2% of Hong Kong's modern territory). It was during this period that migrants from China entered, mainly speaking [[Cantonese]] (the prestige variety of [[Yue Chinese]]) as a common language. During the following century of British rule, Hong Kong grew into a hub of Cantonese culture, and has remained as such since the [[Transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong|handover in 1997]].

Today Hong Kong is one of the world's leading financial centres, and the [[Hong Kong dollar]] is the thirteenth most-traded currency in the world.

=== Macau ===
[[Macau]] native people are known as the [[Tanka people|Tanka]]. A dialect similar to [[Shiqi dialect|Shiqi]] (石岐話), originating from [[Zhongshan]] (中山) in Guangdong, is also spoken in the region.

Parts of Macau were first loaned to the Portuguese by China as a trading centre in the 16th century, with the Portuguese required to administrate the city under Chinese authority. In 1851 and 1864, the Portuguese Empire occupied the two nearest offshore islands [[Taipa]] and [[Coloane]] respectively, and Macau officially became a colony of the [[Portuguese Empire]] in 1887. Macau was [[Transfer of sovereignty over Macau|returned to China]] in 1999.

By 2002, Macau had become one of the world's richest cities,&lt;ref&gt;Macau has become known as the 'Las Vegas of the Far East'. Papers by Cindia Ching-Chi [https://ift.academia.edu/CindiaChingChiLam/Papers/592290/Case_Study_1_Branding_Macau_as_the_Las_Vegas_of_the_Far_East]&lt;/ref&gt; and by 2006, it had surpassed [[Las Vegas]] to become the world's biggest gambling centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/23/business/worldbusiness/23cnd-macao.html|title=Macao Surpasses Las Vegas as Gambling Center|last=Barboza|first=David|date=2007-01-23|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Macau is also a [[Historic Centre of Macau|world cultural heritage site]] due to its Portuguese colonial architecture.

== Culture ==
{{main|Cantonese culture}}
The term "Cantonese" is used to refer to the native culture, language and people of Guangdong and Guangxi.&lt;ref&gt;Unity and diversity: local cultures and identities in China By David Faure [https://books.google.com/books?id=sEbAyJ7aj38C&amp;pg=PA37&amp;dq=cantonese+is+the+western+of+yue&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=-ofhToW0PInd8gP5sbSfBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=cantonese%20is%20the%20western%20of%20yue&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are cultural, economic, political, generational and geographical differences in making "Cantonese-ness" in and beyond Guangdong and Guangxi, with the interacting dynamics of migration, education, social developments and cultural representations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xiao|first=Y.|date=2017|title=Who needs Cantonese, who speaks? Whispers across mountains, delta, and waterfronts|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09502386.2016.1236394|journal=Cultural Studies|volume=31|issue=4|pages=489–522|doi=10.1080/09502386.2016.1236394|issn=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Language ===
The term "Cantonese language" is sometimes used to refer to the broader group of [[Yue Chinese]] languages and dialects spoken in [[Guangdong]] and [[Guangxi]], although it is used more specifically to describe ''Gwóngjāu wah'' (廣州話), the [[Prestige dialect|prestige variant]] of [[Cantonese]] spoken in the city of Guangzhou (historically known as [[Guangzhou|Canton]]). ''Gwóngjāu wah'' is the main language used for education, literature and media in Hong Kong and Macau. It is still widely used in [[Guangzhou]], despite the fact that a considerable proportion of the city's population is made up by migrant workers from elsewhere in China that speak [[Chinese languages|non-Cantonese variants of Chinese]] and [[Standard Mandarin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.cri.cn/4026/2008/01/25/44@317459.htm|title=Migrants In Guangzhou|publisher=|accessdate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though in recent years it is slowly falling out of favour with the younger generation &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://vincehkblog.wordpress.com/2018/05/13/is-cantonese-dying-in-canton-2/|title=Vicebloghk-is Cantonese dying in Canton?|accessdate=30 Aug 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; prompting fears in Cantonese people that the language may die out. Cantonese language's erosen in Guangzhou is due to a mix of suppression of the language and the mass migration of non-Cantonese speaking people in to the area. 

Because of its tradition of usage in music, cinema, literature and newspapers, this form of Cantonese is a cultural mark of identity that distinguishes Cantonese people from the [[Mainland Chinese]]. The pronunciation and vocabulary of Cantonese has preserved many features of the official language of the [[Tang dynasty]] with elements of the ancient Yue language.&lt;ref name="scmpc2"&gt;''South China Morning Post''. [2009] (2009). 11, October. "Linguistic heritage in peril". By Chloe Lai.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Written Cantonese]] is very common in manhua, books, articles, magazines, newspapers, online chat, instant messaging, internet blogs and social networking websites. [[Anime]], [[cartoons]] and foreign films are also dubbed in Cantonese. Some videogames such as [[Sleeping Dogs (video game)|Sleeping Dogs]], [[Far Cry 4]], [[Grand Theft Auto III]] and [[Resident Evil 6]] have substantial Cantonese dialogues.

=== Arts ===

[[Cantopop]] during its early glory had spread to Mainland China, Taiwan, (South) Korea, Japan, Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia. Well-known Cantopop singers include [[Andy Lau]], [[Aaron Kwok]], [[Joey Yung]], [[Alan Tam]], [[Roman Tam]], [[Anita Mui]], [[Danny Chan]], [[Kelly Chen]], [[Leslie Cheung]], [[Jacky Cheung]], [[Leon Lai]], [[Sammi Cheng]] and [[Coco Lee]], many of whom are of Cantonese or [[Taishanese]] origin.

The [[Cinema of Hong Kong|Hong Kong movie industry]] was the third-largest movie industry in the world (after [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] and [[Bollywood]]) for decades throughout the 20th century, with Cantonese-language films viewed and acclaimed around the world. Recent films include ''[[Kung Fu Hustle]]'', ''[[Infernal Affairs]]'' and ''[[Ip Man 3]]''.

Cantonese people are also known to create various schools or styles of arts, with the more prominent being [[Lingnan architecture]], [[Lingnan school of painting]], [[Canton porcelain]], [[Cantonese opera]], [[Guangdong music (genre)|Cantonese music]], among many others.

=== Cuisine ===
[[File:Dumplings-AH.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Cantonese [[dim-sum]].]]
{{main|Cantonese cuisine}}
Cantonese cuisine has become one of the most renowned types of cuisine around the world, characterised by its variety of cooking methods and use of fresh ingredients, particularly seafood.&lt;ref name="Chapius-01"&gt;{{cite book |title=Cuisine and Culture: A History of Food and People |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CwRE0HIIyWkC&amp;pg=PA281&amp;dq=Cantonese+food+is+the+best&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=-_mnTv2iEYaw8gOWronLDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Cantonese%20food%20is%20the%20best&amp;f=false |accessdate=|pages=281}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most famous examples of Cantonese cuisine is [[dim sum]], a variety of small and light dishes such as ''[[har gow]]'' (steamed shrimp dumplings), ''[[Shumai|siu mai]]'' (steamed pork dumplings), and ''[[cha siu bao]]'' (barbecued pork buns).

==Genetics==
According to research, Cantonese peoples' paternal lineage is mostly [[Han Chinese|Han]], while their maternal lineage is mostly [[Nanyue]] [[Baiyue|aboriginals]].&lt;ref&gt;Wen, B.; Li, H.; Lu, D.; Song, X.; Zhang, F.; He, Y.; Li, F.; Gao, Y.; 等.

Building upon his coaching success, in 1992 he was promoted to technical director of [[combined event]]s and [[throwing event|throws]] by the Dutch athletics federation. He took on other coaching responsibilities, including a brief stay in China where he met [[shot put]] thrower [[Huang Zhihong]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://rss.xinhuanet.com/newsc/english/2008-08/07/content_9035673.htm Dutch Olympic team chief looks to top 10 finish in Beijing]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.

She had moved away from home to attend a sports institute at the age of twelve and had not experienced life outside of the centre. Van Commenee had helped her adapt to living on her own and supporting herself, at the same time as he helped her to a World Championship medal.&lt;ref name=Turnbull&gt;Turnbull, Simon (2008-09-07).

The coach showed his stubborn and determined temperament when in 1996 he withdrew from managing the Dutch Olympic team because he felt that one of his trainees, [[Sharon Jaklofsky]], was receiving unfair treatment. His trip to the [[1996 Atlanta Olympics]] was self-funded and he took Jaklofsky out of the Dutch camp for training every day. She reached the finals of the competition but faulted three times, failing to record a mark.&lt;ref name=Mott/&gt;

== British coaching ==
Van Commenee first met British [[heptathlon]] athlete [[Denise Lewis]] in 1994 at an athletics meeting in [[Valladolid]], Spain. Her coach [[Darrell Bunn]] could not attend the meeting and Van Commenee was asked to help her through the event. Impressed with his work, Lewis moved to Amsterdam to train with Van Commenee in 1997. The pairing was fruitful for both athlete and coach; under the supervision of Van Commenee, Lewis went on become heptathlon champion at both the [[1998 Commonwealth Games|Commonwealth Games]] and [[1998 European Championships in Athletics|European Championships]] in 1998 and won silver at the [[1999 World Championships in Athletics|1999 World Championships]].&lt;ref&gt;Knight, Tom (2001-01-13).

Although she was ranked 57th in the world for the heptathlon, she won the bronze medal at the [[2004 Athens Olympics]].

Van Commenee was considered for the job but ultimately decided to leave the UK in favour of becoming technical director of the Netherlands athletics team.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/athletics/4057943.stm Collins named UK Athletics chief].

==Character overview==
Doctor Pretorius is a renegade [[mad scientist]] who persuades [[Victor Frankenstein|Henry Frankenstein]] to resume his experiments with bringing dead flesh to life. An amoral egomaniac, he has no regard for human life or ethics and cares only for his own prestige as a scientist.

Along with his sinister qualities, Pretorius is responsible for a large share of the film's dark humor. He eats a picnic dinner in a crypt, trades prissy banter with [[Frankenstein's monster|the Monster]] and laments that the tiny ballerina he created "will only dance to [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]]'s 'Spring Song.'" He claims that [[gin]] is his only weakness. Then later in the film, he claims his [[cigars]] are his only weakness when he first meets the Monster. Pretorius also delivers the famous toast "To a new world of gods and monsters!" midway through the film.

==In the film==
Septimus Pretorius, Frankenstein's former teacher, is a tall, emaciated-looking man with an unusually large nose and devilish pointed ears. A professor of [[philosophy]] at the [[University of Ingolstadt]], Pretorius first points young Henry on the path toward his unwholesome [[experiment]]s in giving life to the dead. He himself is "booted out" from his teaching post "for knowing too much." Pretorius seeks out his former student after learning that the Monster has survived being trapped in the burning [[windmill]] in the [[climax (narrative)|climax]] of the first film. Pretorius himself acknowledges that he may be insane in a conversation with Frankenstein ("You think I'm mad? Perhaps I am!").

Pretorius performs experiments creating life similar to Henry's. He unveils to Henry a group of various [[Homunculus|homunculi]]—miniature living humans which he has kept in [[bottle]]s and claims to have grown from "[[seed]]" like cultures. Each figure represents a different character:

* A [[Queen consort|Queen]] which he claims was his first experiment.
* A [[King]] which is madly in love with the Queen and has a resemblance to [[Henry VIII]]. Pretorius has to be very careful with the King and work to keep the King and Queen separated. This is even shown when the King briefly breaks out of his bottle only to be caught by Pretorius and put back in his jar with his cup on top of the jar.
* An [[Archbishop]] which disapproves of what the King is doing to win the Queen's heart
* The [[Devil]] who is depicted as a man in a black suit and a cape. Pretorious gleefully compares his own visage to that of the Devil: "There's a certain resemblance to me, don't you think? Or do I flatter myself?" He says sometimes he thinks life would be more interesting if they were all devils.
* A [[Ballet dancer|Ballerina dancer]] who will only dance to [[Felix Mendelssohn]]'s "Spring Song".
* A [[Mermaid]] grown from "an experiment with seaweed" which lives in water-filled bottle.

He has been unsuccessful in creating a full-sized human. He proposes to Henry that together they create a mate for his [[Frankenstein's monster|monster]], with Henry building the body and Pretorius supplying an artificially-grown [[brain]]. Henry initially balks at the idea, but Pretorius reminds him that he is capable of exposing him to the authorities as the creator of the Monster who has done so much damage.

Later, he meets the Monster in a crypt where he has gone to steal bodies and is dining using the top of a coffin as a picnic table. When the Monster asks him 'Friend?' he gives him the remains of his chicken. He tells the Monster of his plans to create a mate for him.  

The Monster, eager for companionship of any kind, considers Pretorius his friend, and from then on is willing to do anything that the impish scientist desires, such as [[kidnapping]] Henry's wife, Elizabeth, in order to force him to help Pretorius. Henry agrees, and together the two scientists create the [[Bride of Frankenstein (character)|Bride of Frankenstein]]. Unfortunately, even the Bride finds her would-be husband repulsive, and the heartbroken Monster decides to end his life by blowing up the laboratory. He instructs Henry and Elizabeth to run but barks at Pretorius to stay, saying that they "belong dead". Before Pretorius can move, the Monster blows up the laboratory and the castle. Frankenstein and Elizabeth escape, but Pretorius's fate is not revealed.

The Monster, however, returned in the next sequel.

==Psychosexual aspects of the character==
Dr. Pretorius is frequently identified as [[homosexual]], or as near to homosexual as could be presented on-screen in 1935. (There is, of course, no direct reference to homosexuality in the film.) ''Bride of Frankenstein'' director [[James Whale]] was openly [[gay]] and frequently included [[camp (style)|camp]] elements in his films. He directed Thesiger (himself identified in some sources as more or less openly gay)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Pretorius serves as a figure of seduction and temptation, pulling Frankenstein away from his bride on their wedding night to engage in the unnatural act of non-procreative life. The [[Joseph Breen|Breen Office]], responsible for enforcing Hollywood's [[Production Code]], let Pretorius' behavior pass unchallenged. A novelisation of the film published in England made the implication even more clear, having Pretorius say to Frankenstein, "'Be fruitful and multiply.' Let us obey the [[Bible|Biblical]] injunction: you of course, have the choice of natural means; but as for me, I am afraid that there is no course open to me but the scientific way."&lt;ref&gt;Egremont, Michael, quoted in Skal p. 189&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other appearances==
{{original research|section|date=July 2013}}
Pretorius appears in [[Kim Newman]]'s crossover novel ''[[Dracula Cha Cha Cha]]'', as a colleague of [[H. P. Lovecraft]]'s [[Herbert West]]. He appears as one of the horror movie spoofs in ''[[Jesus Christ Vampire Hunter]]'' and also appears in [[Allan Rune Pettersson]]'s novel ''[[Frankenstein's Aunt Returns]]''.

In the Amicus horror film ''[[The House That Dripped Blood]]'' (1970), [[Geoffrey Bayldon]], playing a mysterious antique shop owner, is made up and costumed to look like [[Ernest Thesiger]] as Pretorius.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

In the 1973 NBC-TV miniseries ''[[Frankenstein: The True Story]]'', [[James Mason]] portrays a Pretorius-like figure named Dr. Polidori (named for [[Lord Byron]]'s real-life physician, [[John William Polidori]], who was part of the 1816 gathering that produced [[Mary Shelley]]'s novel and also the author of the story "[[The Vampyre]]"). Mason's Dr. Polidori enlists Victor to assist in creating the female creature Prima ([[Jane Seymour]]).

The 1986 film ''[[From Beyond (film)|From Beyond]]'' adds a Dr. Edward Pretorius at [[Miskatonic University]] (played by [[Ted Sorel]]) as a dark mentor for Crawford Tillinghast ([[Jeffrey Combs]]). This Pretorius is an impotent sadist (with a room full of bondage gear) who is assimilated by "the Beyond" and attempts to drag others into it, boasting that the [[pineal gland]] growth brought on by the resonator is like "an orgasm of the mind".

The 1989 [[Akif Pirinçci]] novel ''[[Felidae (novel)|Felidae]]'' and its 1994 [[Felidae (film)|animated feature film adaptation]] feature an insane Professor Preterius in the backstory performing increasingly dark experiments on the cat Claudandus.

In the 1998 independent film ''[[Gods and Monsters (film)|Gods and Monsters]]'', directed by [[Bill Condon]], Ernest Thesiger as Pretorius is played by [[Arthur Dignam]] in a flashback about the filming of ''Bride of Frankenstein''. An earlier scene shows [[Brendan Fraser]] as Whale's gardener watching ''Bride of Frankenstein'' on television, specifically the climatic scene of Pretorius and Frankenstein unveiling the Bride.

In the 2007 ''[[Frankenstein (2007 film)|Frankenstein]]'' TV movie, the character of Professor Jane Pretorius is based on Septimus Pretorius and served as Victoria Frankenstein's boss.

In the Dark Horse "Universal's Monsters" novel, ''The Bride Of Frankenstein: Pandora's Bride'', Pretorius somehow survives the destruction of the tower lab along with the Bride. They escape to Germany where he teaches her to become her own woman.

In ''[[Mary Shelley's Frankenhole]]'', the character Professor Sanguinaire Polidori (voiced by [[Scott Adsit]]) is based on Septimus Pretorius.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

'''Firdaus Kanga''' (born 1960, [[Bombay]]) is a writer and actor who lives in [[London]]. He has written a novel, ''[[Trying to Grow]]'' a [[Autobiographical novel|semi-autobiographical novel]] set in India and a travel book ''Heaven on Wheels'' about his experiences in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name=it/&gt; ''[[Trying to Grow]]'' was later turned FI film, ''[[Sixth Happiness]]'', for which Kanga wrote the screenplay, and in which he starred.

==Early life==
Kanga was born in a [[Parsi]] family in [[Bombay]]nowMumbai in 1959. He adjusted to his disability early  life, and was tough mentally. Till fourth grade Kanga was tutored at home, after which he joined the Campion School in 
Mumbai.&lt;ref name=it&gt;{{ cite news|title=Disabled writer Firdaus Kanga makes waves in London|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/disabled-writer-firdaus-kanga-makes-waves-in-london/1/318576.html|newspaper=[[India Today]]|date=1991-07-31|accessdate=2014-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sixth Happiness - BFI/BBC Film==
''[[Sixth Happiness]]'' is about Brit - a boy born with brittle bones who never grows taller than four feet. It is also about the [[Parsi people|Parsi]] or Parsees - descendants of the Persian empire who were driven out of Persia by an Islamic invasion more than a thousand years ago and settled in western India. Parsees had a close relationship with the British during the years of the Raj. Brit is named by his mother, both after his brittle bones, and in tribute to his mother's love of Britain. The depiction of Brit's parents as ardent Anglophiles with fond memories of the Raj and WW2, presents a glimpse of a non-stereotypical Indian family. This, along with the story of a young disabled man's sexual awakening as family life crumbles around him makes ''[[Sixth Happiness]]'' an interesting exploration of modern, urban India. Kanga's creation - both as writer and performer - resists drawing the main star Brit as either martyr or victim. Brit is bright, spiky, opinionated and selfish with a razor-sharp wit. He prefers the Kama Sutra to Shakespeare and does not allow gender or disability to come in the way of his desire for love.

==Television==
Firdaus Kanga has presented documentaries, such as '' Double the Trouble, Twice the Fun '' (d. [[Pratibha Parmar]], 1992), a provocative documentary drama that explored [[sexuality and disability]]. The film was broadcast as part of Channel Four's lesbian and gay series ''Out''. Taboo, another documentary presented by Kanga, explored religion and disability - for instance, the Hindu notions of [[karma]] - exploring how religion can exclude and patronize people of disability.

==Kanga's history and cultural contribution==
Firdaus Kanga was born with [[osteogenesis imperfecta]], a condition also known as brittle bones disease. This left him with several painful fractures throughout his childhood and adolescence in [[India]]. He grew up in a family of five, in a one bedroom [[Bombay]] apartment. He spoke out against the Indian socialist consensus, and was a supporter of Reagan and Thatcher politics. Kanga's first major achievement was ''[[Trying to Grow]]'' (also translated into French [Grandir] and Italian) a novel exploring disability, sexuality and culture. In [[India]] where religion still dictates most cultural acts, Kanga's novel broke several taboos - portraying disabled people with healthy, rich sexual appetites. Kanga publicly rejected [[Hindu]] notions of [[karma]] (laying responsibility for suffering at what humans may have done in their last birth) often foisted on disabled people. Kanga was one of the first few public figures in India who stood up for the views of [[gay]] people, celebrating sexuality, in a society that still criminalizes, though hardly, if ever, prosecutes [[homosexuality]].

==Influential Indian writing==
Kanga was selected to be part of The Vintage Book of Indian Writing: 1947-97 - a major anthology of the work of the most important and influential Indian writers of the last 50 years. This volume was published by [[Salman Rushdie]] and Elizabeth West to coincide with the anniversary of India's independence.

Kanga was born in [[Bombay]] in the westernised [[Parsi people|Parsi]] community, and his writing centres on dealing with disability and sexuality. 

He had interview with Stephen Hawking A visit to Cambridge University this was lesson in English book

'''Gilbert and Eleanor Kraus''' were an American couple known for rescuing 50 Jewish children prior to the beginning of [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="Lipman"&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://jewishweek.timesofisrael.com/the-unlikeliest-rescue-mission/|title=The Unlikeliest Rescue Mission|author=Steve Lipman|date=March 28, 2013|accessdate=June 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Gilbert and Eleanor Kraus lived in the [[Fitler Square, Philadelphia|Fitler Square]] neighborhood of [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name="Lipman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://time.com/3879630/50-children-an-american-couple-saves-kids-from-nazi-germany/|title=50 Children: An American Couple's Mission to Save Kids From the Third Reich|author=Ben Cosgrove|date=April 20, 2013|accessdate=June 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gilbert, educated at the [[University of Pennsylvania Law School]], was an attorney, partner of a law firm, and president of Philadelphia Records. He founded the Doyleston Legal Aid Society, was president of the Bucks County Mental Health Society, and a member of Eagleville Hospital. He also bred Guernsey cows.&lt;ref name="GIlbert obit"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/172936840/?terms=Gilbert%2BEleanor%2BKraus |title=Gilbert J.

They sent their children to a Quaker school. Eleanor wrote about the mission that they undertook, but it was not published during her lifetime.&lt;ref name="Lipman" /&gt; Gilbert died in 1975 and Eleanor died in 1989.&lt;ref name="Lipman" /&gt;

==Background==
After Austria was annexed to [[Nazi Germany]] through the [[Anschluss]] in 1938, conditions became difficult for Jews and they lost their rights. Many people wanted to immigrate to the United States, but immigration policy was very restrictive due to the Depression and anti-Semitism.&lt;ref name="NNJN"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://njjewishnews.com/article/17407/film-features-nj-survivors-rescued-as-kids#.WVVACFMrKRs|title=Film features NJ survivors rescued as kids|author=Debra Rubin|date=May 20, 2013|accessdate=June 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] had asked that the American immigration quotas be expanded after the Anschluss. There were about 95,000 people who immigrated to the United States by 1939, particularly spiking after [[Kristallnacht]] in November 1938. There were about 399,000 Jews who left Austria and Germany by that time.&lt;ref name="JID" /&gt; The problem was not getting out of Nazi Germany, though, the problem was that there were not enough safe havens to accept them.&lt;ref name="JID"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jewishideasdaily.com/6423/features/they-all-could-have-been-saved-2/?print |title=They All Could Have Been Saved | author=Lance J. Sussman |date=May 2, 2013 |website=Jewish Ideas Daily |accessdate=June 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; There were also some Jewish community leaders who asked the Krauses not to perform the rescue mission for fear of an uprising of anti-semitism in America.&lt;ref name="JID" /&gt;}} Since 1934, there were Jewish groups who tried, but failed in bringing Jewish children to the United States. They knew three Philadelphian Quaker men who went to Berlin in December 1938 on a rescue mission, but were unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="Time" /&gt;

==Rescue mission==
Gilbert developed a relationship with [[United States Assistant Secretary of State|Assistant Secretary of State]] [[George S. Messersmith]], who had served as general counsel in Berlin (1930–1934) and then in Vienna (1934–1937), to focus his efforts in Vienna to rescue the children. Gilbert thought, though, that the best effort would be to work through [[Berlin]] first to have visas that were issued but unused due to death, travel to other countries, or arrest released for the children.&lt;ref name="Forward" /&gt; After meeting with Louis Levine, who originally proposed the idea, and Kraus, Messersmith issued a memo to the American embassy consul general [[Raymond H. Geist]] and the State Department officials in charges of visas about the plan.&lt;ref name="USHMM" /&gt;

Eleanor took on fundraising and finding families who would take in the children. B’rith Sholom held fundraisers for the rescue mission. They raised $150,000&lt;ref name="Forward"&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://forward.com/culture/173372/hbo-documentary-tells-story-of-kindertransport-tha/|title=HBO Documentary Tells Story of Kindertransport That Saved 50 Children|author=Dorothy Brown|date=March 22, 2013|magazine=[[The Forward]]|accessdate=June 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and obtained 54 signed affidavits from families who said that they would support the children.&lt;ref name="USHMM" /&gt;

With the support of [[B'rith Sholom]], they went to Nazi occupied Austria and rescued children between the ages of five and fourteen in Vienna before the outbreak of World War II, which required them working with Jewish leaders in their community who opposed the effort and American immigration policy that make the effort difficult.&lt;ref name="Lipman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NNJN" /&gt; Gilbert set sail for Europe in early April 1939, and although Eleanor had been warned by the State Department not to travel to Europe, she traveled to Europe after Gilbert wired her from Vienna that he needed her help.&lt;ref name="Forward" /&gt; Traveling with them was a German-speaking Jewish pediatrician, Dr. Robert Schless. In Vienna, they met with individuals in the Nazi bureaucracy and at embassies.&lt;ref name="Lipman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NNJN" /&gt;

{{quote box|align=right|width=33%|To take a child from its mother seemed to be the lowest thing a human being could do. Yet it was as if we had drawn up in a lifeboat in a most turbulent sea.

Hundreds of parents and children showed up to apply to have the children selected for the rescue. The children selected, 25 girls and 25 boys, were the ones considered most resilient to be separated from their family, whom they might not see again.&lt;ref name="Forward" /&gt;

The Krauses traveled by train from the Vienna. When the children said goodbye to their families at the railroad station they were told they could not wave goodbye, as it might be considered as the Nazi salute and could result in their arrest.&lt;ref name="Forward" /&gt; In Berlin, the group received 50 visas from Geist.&lt;ref name="Forward" /&gt; They met with the [[Gestapo]] to obtain the passports for the children.&lt;ref name="USHMM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JNNC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jweekly.com/2013/04/05/film-recounts/|title=Film recounts heroic story of couple who saved 50 children|website=Jewish News of Northern California|author=Renee Ghert-Zand|date=April 5, 2013|accessdate=June 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They then traveled to Hamburg, where they set sail for New York aboard the ''S.S. President Harding''&lt;ref name="Forward" /&gt; and arrived on June 3, 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/89491506/?terms=Gilbert%2BKraus |title=50 Jewish Refugee Tots Are Happy in New Home | author= |date=June 5, 1939 |newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |page=2|accessdate=June 30, 2017|via=newspapers.com|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The children were first brought to B'rith Sholom's summer camp in [[Collegeville, Pennsylvania]], which had a 25-bedroom house.&lt;ref name="Time" /&gt; They then went to live with relatives who lived in the United States or foster families. The Krauses wanted to make another mission, but after the war began they were unable to make another rescue.&lt;ref name="Lipman" /&gt; Related documents and photographs were donated to the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]].&lt;ref name="USHMM"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://collections.ushmm.org/search/catalog/irn95751|title=Gilbert and Eleanor Kraus collection|website=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|accessdate=June 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''50 Children''==
Their story was made into the documentary ''[[50 Children: The Rescue Mission of Mr. and Mrs. Kraus]]'' (2013) by [[Steven Pressman]], the husband of their granddaughter [[Liz Perle]]. It premiered on [[Yom HaShoah]], Holocaust Remembrance Day. According to Pressman, they were "the single largest group of [Jewish] children" that were brought to the United States during the Holocaust in one group.&lt;ref name="Lipman" /&gt;

Boy was inducted as a Fellow of the [[Air and Space Academy]] (Europe) in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.academie-air-espace.com/mship/newdetail.php?varMbre=561|title=Air &amp; Space Academy – Member Detail: Guy BOY|publisher=Air &amp; Space Academy|accessdate=1 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and a Senior Member of the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://awards.acm.org/award_winners/boy_2738987.cfm|title=Guy Boy – Award Winner|publisher=ACM|accessdate=1 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
Boy's early [[cognitive engineering]] research was on the first [[Glass cockpit]], conducted with Airbus and the French aviation authorities (1980–1984). He actively contributed to develop human-centered methods for cockpit design and certification of the first two crewmen cockpits. This early leadership in cognitive engineering led to an award from the French Ministry of Defense that supported part of his work at NASA Ames, where he developed an operation assistant system to enhance the control of the Orbital Refueling System of [[Space Shuttle]] (1984-1986). He coined the term "intelligent assistant systems" to denote systems that support human operators in safety-critical situations.

After two years in France (1987–1988), where he co-founded a start-up company on intelligent assistant systems, Dialogics/Dialexis, he returned to NASA Ames to work on electronic documentation for the [[Space Station Freedom]] (1989–1991). During this period, influenced by [[Douglas Engelbart|Douglas Englebart]], who he worked with for a while, he developed an approach mixing hypertext and machine learning, leading to a system called Computer Integrated Documentation. This work led to a major publication on context-sensitive indexing.

Back to France, he was nominated leading expert in Information Society and Technology for the [[European Commission]]. He served as an expert for the [[European Space Agency]] to establish the area of human-machine interaction and artificial intelligence (1991–1992). Creating and developing EURISCO, he became a legal expert for aircraft accident investigations (1992-1994). He then started new investigations in cockpit design and produced the Cognitive Function Analysis (CFA) method that was extensively used in industry for the design of safety-critical systems. Commercial aircraft cockpits became more computerized and generated more studies in human-computer interaction (HCI). He combined HCI and artificial Intelligence approaches not only in the aerospace domain, but also in education through the use of software agents. He also created the Group Elicitation Method (GEM) that is used for knowledge elicitation in HCD, and more specifically in [[participatory design]]. He helped in the restructuring of Air France at the highest level using GEM. GEM was used in many industrial settings, e.g., Airbus, Nokia, Daimler, Toyota Europe and in several European Integrated Projects funded by the European Commission. He collaborated to the Handbook of Human-Computer Interaction with a chapter in knowledge elicitation for the design of software agents. He wrote an introductory text under the auspices of [[UNESCO]] on theories of human cognition to better understand the co-adaptation of people and technology, in knowledge management, organizational intelligence and learning, and complexity. He coordinated the French Handbook of Cognitive Engineering: A Human-Computer Interaction and Cognition (Traité d'Ingénierie Cognitive: IHM et Cognition).

He then contributed to develop the field of HCI in France, and was Co-Founder of AFIHM,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afihm.org/association/320/conseil_d_administration.php|title=AFIHM – Association Francophone d'Interaction Homme-Machine|publisher=Afihm.org|accessdate=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the French national equivalent of Association for Computing Machinery SIGCHI. He co-founded the first French [[ACM SIGCHI]] local chapter in Toulouse. He was the first French [[CHI (conference)|CHI]] paper Co-Chair (Inter-CHI 1993) with [[Jakob Nielsen (usability consultant)|Jakob Nielsen]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sics.se/~jussi/Artiklar/Opublicerat/1993_rejected_InterCHI/ic93-papers-guide.txt] {{dead link|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was elected Executive Vice Chair of ACM SIGCHI (1995–1999), making him the first European ACM SIGCHI top executive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://old.sigchi.org/bulletin/1996.1/chairs.html|title=SIGCHI Bulletin Vol.28 No.1, January 1996: 50 Years ACM, 14 Years SIGCHI|publisher=Old.sigchi.org|accessdate=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This service to the HCI community, together with Richard Anderson, contributed to the creation of several local chapters worldwide. Within the human-computer interaction community, he collaborated with colleagues that were influential throughout his professional life, including [[Jeffrey Bradshaw|Jeff Bradshaw]], [[John M. Carroll (information scientist)|John Carroll]], [[Jonathan Grudin]], [[Don Norman]], [[Terry Winograd]], among many others. In 2015, he was elected Co-Chair of the [[INCOSE]] Human-Systems Integration Working Group.

He also founded the HCI-Aero (Human-Computer Interaction in Aerospace) conference series&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aaai.org/Library/HCI/hci-library.php|title=AAAI Digital Library — Human-Computer Interaction in Aeronautics Conference|publisher=Aaai.org|accessdate=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in cooperation with ACM-SIGCHI, the International Ergonomics Association and the Air and Space Academy (Program Chair, 1998-2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://research.fit.edu/hci-aero/HCI-Aero2014/Home.html|title=Home|publisher=Research.fit.edu|accessdate=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; HCI-Aero conferences followed the Human-Machine Interaction and Artificial Intelligence in Aerospace conference series, also created by Boy (1986–1995). HCI-Aero conferences have become a major reference in the field of HCI in Aerospace (full papers are indexed in the ACM Digital Library). He also created the Technical Committee on Human-Factors and Ergonomics of the [[International Ergonomics Association]] (IEA), which he leads since 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iea.cc/about/technical.php?id=51c0603673556|title=Aerospace HFE – IEA Website|publisher=Iea.cc|accessdate=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He scientifically led two main projects regarding safety and human-computer interaction in aeronautics: DIVA,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/research/growth/aeronautics-days/pdf/posters/diva.pdf|format=PDF|title=DESIGN OF HUMAN / MACHINE INTERFACES (HMI) AND THEIR VALIDATION IN AERONAUTICS (DIVA)|publisher=Ec.europa.eu|accessdate=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; a European project that tried to understand aircrew's awareness of both aircraft internal states and external situations using cognitive function analysis (1998-2001); and PAUSA, a French national project on authority distribution in air traffic management that contributed to the emergence of the Orchestra model for socio-cognitive analysis of multi-agent life-critical systems (2006-2008). This model and the development of HCDi led to the publication of the book, Orchestrating Human-Centered Design where he promotes education and training of leaders who understand technology, organizations and people (the TOP model). This book presents a humanist approach to design, engineering and more globally education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cpe.wpi.edu/images/CPE-New/IncoseInsightVol16No02-2013Jul.pdf|format=PDF|title=A PUBLICATION OF THE INTERNATIONAL COUNCIL ON SYSTEMS ENGINEERING|publisher=Cpe.wpi.edu|accessdate=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Jen Narkevicius, he proposed a unification of HCD and systems engineering for a better definition of human-systems integration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-02812-5_12|title=Unifying Human Centered Design and Systems Engineering for Human Systems Integration |accessdate=1 December 2014|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-02812-5_12|journal=Complex Systems Design &amp; Management|pages=151–162}}&lt;/ref&gt; He extended this HCD research effort on safety-critical systems to nuclear power plant control and management with two of his Ph.D. students.

And Judith, when three hours had passed, her mother’s womb did leave.

One urine passage serves for both; one anus, so they tell;
The other parts their numbers keep, and serve their owners well.
Their parents poor did send them forth, the world to travel through,
That this great wonder of the age should not be hid from view.
The inner parts concealed do lie hid from our eyes, alas!
But all the body here you view erect in solid brass.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''John Shertzer Hittell''' (J.S. Hittell, 25 December 1825 – 8 March 1901) was an American author, historian, and journalist of the [[United States]]  during the [[Golden Age of Freethought|Golden Age of Free Thought]]. Hittell wrote on a wide variety of topics including [[history]], [[mining]], [[Christianity]], [[Pantheism]], [[phrenology]], [[morality]], and [[politics]]. He is best known for his works ''A History of The City of San Francisco and Incidentally of the State of California (1878)'' and ''The Evidences Against Christianity (1856)''.

== Life and career ==

=== Early life and education ===
John Hittell was born December 25, 1825 in Jonestown, Lebanon County, Pennsylvania to Catherine and Jacob Hittell. Both of his parents were German immigrants who moved to The United States of America before The American Revolution. His family moved to Hamilton, a town in Southwestern Ohio, in 1832.

His brother [[Theodore H. Hittell]] was an author and historian who met and wrote about the life of [[John "Grizzly" Adams]] in his book ''The Adventures of James Capen Adams, Mountaineer and Grizzly Bear Hunter of California''.

Starting in 1839, Hittell attended Miami University and learned Latin, Greek, French, Mathematics, Chemistry, and Rhetoric. He obtained a Masters of the Arts degree in 1843. After graduating, Hittell decided to go into Law and entered the office of John Woods, a leading attorney in Hamiltin. His studies were interrupted by dyspepsia and headaches which Hittell attempted to cure by long walks and working on a farm in Hake County, Indiana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John Hittell Autobiography|url=http://oac.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/kt4k4020qr/?order=4&amp;brand=oac4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gold mining ===

In the spring of 1849 during the excitement of the [[Gold Rush]] he left the bank of the Missouri River with a company of adventurers en route to California. They arrived at the Sacramento River on Sept. 19th. Hittell spent the winter of 1849 and 1850 at Reading's Diggings (Shasta County).

He would go on to write books on mining with Mining in the Pacific states of North America (1861) and Hittel on Gold Mines and Mining (1864) respectively.

=== Move to San Francisco and writings ===

In 1852, Hittell moved to San Francisco and in 1853 joined the editorial staff of the "Alta California", where he remained employed for the following 25 years. Hittell was the author of numerous books concerning California history, resources, and industries.

He became one of the editorial writers of the Alta California newspaper, a position which he held, though not continuously, for more than twenty-four years. He was known as a hard worker and careful student, as was soon recognized as an authority in matters relating to the industries and resources of the State. In 1862 he published a book called "The Resources of California," and the seventh edition of it appeared in 1879. "A History of San Francisco," from his pen, was issued in 1878. Her has written several other books, numbering at least half a dozen, and has contributed much to cyclopedias and magazines. His range of knowledge was wide, including familiarity with the literature and tongues of Germany, France, Spain, and Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A History and Biographical Cyclopaedia of Butler County Ohio, With Illustrations and Sketches of its Representative Men and Pioneers|url=http://www.usbiographies.org/ohio/bios/butler/hittelljs.txt|publisher=Western  Biographical Publishing Company|date=1882}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has been credited with being among the group of people to name [[Lake Tahoe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hart|first1=James D.|title=Companion to California|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=teJCPQtWfOMC&amp;pg=PA268&amp;lpg=PA268&amp;dq=j.s.+hittell+tahoe&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=v0r9N5h0g1&amp;sig=NF1RswfTJcCr7gXaF8bWaBqHyx4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj5s_DdmZHWAhUpxlQKHcRACJ4Q6AEILzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=j.s.%20hittell%20tahoe&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hittell owned land on [[Mount Diablo]] in a location known as Deer Flat. In 1873 an entrepreneur known as J.S. Hall, who had owned and conducted the famous Summit and [[Tip-Top House]] in Washington, approached Hittell about building a hotel, and constructing a carriage road to the summit of Mount Diablo. The two failed to come to satisfactory terms, with Hall finding a new place for the construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=THE MOUNT DIABLO HOTEL ENTERPRISE|url=http://www.newspaperabstracts.com/link.php?id=76599}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1867 Hittell filed a patent for a new Washing Machine which he described as "consisting of an upright paddle-wheel common wash-tub, and is much more expeditious than the Wash-board".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Patent for new Washing Machine".|url=http://www.google.al/patents/US61067}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Works of fiction ===
In 1878 Hittell wrote versions of famous stories, adding in his own characters and plot. These were Regolstein: A Comedy (1878), based on 
[[La Grande-Duchesse de Gérolstein]] and Tannwald: A Drama based on [[Goethe's Faust]] by [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]].

=== Translations of works by Carl Reichenbach ===
Hittell undertook the first English translations of two works by author [[Carl Reichenbach]]. These were Odic-Magnetic Letters and a section of the large work, The Sensitive Man and His Relation to Od, titled Somnambulism and Cramp.

== Religious views andwritings ==
Hittell was a known freethinker in the early [[Freethought]] movement as well as a [[Pantheist]] as described in his book ''A Plea for Patheism''. Of his more well known books is ''The Evidences Against Christianity''.

Upon hearing that Hittell was to write a series of lectures against Christianity, famed early leader of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] [[Parley P. Pratt]] sent him a letter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chapter 50 Autobiography of Parley Parker Pratt|url=http://www.gordonbanks.com/gordon/family/ppprattauto.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|text=MR. J.S. HITTELL.
Sir--What do you mean by the term "Christianity?" If you mean the system taught by Christ and His Apostles, as recorded in the "New Testament," you need give yourself or the public no uneasiness, for no such system has troubled the earth for the last thousand years at least, so far as we have any knowledge, except in the single instance of its restoration in the United States by the Prophet Joseph Smith; and even this has been misnamed "Mormonism", and driven to the mountains of Utah.

In short, this Christianity of the New Testament is a system of visions, angels, revelations, prophesyings, gifts, miracles, etc. Such system you can never oppose--it speaks and acts for itself; its votaries know what they experience, see, hear and feel.

As to the modern systems--the forms without power, they are not worth opposing; they are dying of themselves before the power and intelligence of truth made manifest by "Mormonism."

I am happy to subscribe myself

The friend of truth and man, PARLEY P. PRATT}}

They appeared to be good friends with Pratt mentioning in reply to one Rev. Mr. Briggs in which Pratt was defending his polygamy against attacks made by Briggs, states:

{{Quote|text=He takes Polygamy, adultery, theft and murder, and compounds them all together as crime! And then seems to infer that a man would steal, commit adultery, etc., simply from the fact that he has a house full of wives and children! And even my good friend the learned and candid Mr. Hittell, although very just in the main drift of his argument, the other evening seemed to recognize no very clear distinction between Polygamy and adultery, or between a man having his own wife, or robbing a neighbor of his wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chapter 51 Autobiography of Parley P. Pratt|url=http://www.boap.org/LDS/Early-Saints/PPPratt.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Kalicharan Brahma''' ({{lang-brx|कालिचरन ब्रह्म}} 1860–1938), originally Kalicharan Mech, was a 20th-century social and religious reformer of [[Bodo people|Bodo]] society.  He joined a new religion called [[Brahmo Dharma]] / [[Brahmoism]] [[Adi Brahmo Samaj]] faction in Calcutta around 1906, and he is reverentially called ''Gurudev'' or ''Guru Brahma'' by Bodo people of lower plains of [[Assam]] along Brahmaputra river. Other great Assamese [[Brahmo]]s of the time include [[Gunabhiram Barua]] and [[Swarnalata Devi]] of the same faction, all of whom agitated against Colonialist Imperialism of any kind. The followers of this group are locally known as Brahmas in tribute to their religion and the holy river of which they are sons. He was the founder of Boro Satra Sanmilanni ([[All Bodo Students Union]]).
==Early life==
Kalicharan was born on 18 April 1860, at [[Kajigaon]] village in [[Dhubri district]], [[Assam]] state of India. His father was Khoularam Mech and mother was Randini Mech. Khoularam was a timber merchant and one of the rich person of the those days, as Kalicharan grew up he became intelligent, honest and thoughtful.&lt;ref&gt;"Kalicharan Brahma" https://listbodolist.wordpress.com/2016/12/27/kalicharan-brahma/&lt;/ref&gt; He became a great religious preacher of [[Brahma]] faith and brought over revolutionary changes in Bodo society by his continuous and sustained programme of reformation against the prevailing [[Bathou]] worship. All the educated and enlightened section of the Bodo community including [[Rup Nath Brahma]] lent their all-round efforts in his reformatory programme, religious propagation through spread of education and political activism."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bodoland.org/history3.htm Welcome to Bodoland - History&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
His pre-primary education in his home with a private tutor Birnarayan Mech. Later he joint in Tipkai primary school. After passing the primary school he joined in Puthimari M. V. School. But when he got in class five his father was dead
. Kalicharan had to come back to home although he did not want to give up the school.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ranchai.blogspot.in/2016/11/gurudev-kalicharan-brahma-and-his.html?m=1/ "Gurudev Kalicharan Brahma and His Philosophy- Ranchaigiri Brahma"] Retrieved 25 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
By the end of the 19th century and the early part of the 20th century, the Bodo Society was also suffering from religious, moral and political degradation. The young Kalicharan Brahma could perceive the deplorable condition of the Bodos who were"bogged down with evil social practices" due to which the other commitments despised them. The Bodos who were one of the original inhabitants of the [[Brahmaputra]] valley were going through an identity crisis like the other marginalised indigenous Assamese communities. They had developed an inferiority complex. They were rapidly relinquishing their customs and traditions. The Bodo Society was disintegrating with the increase in the number of conversion to other religions. Many educated and affluent Bodos had begun to see their traditional beliefs and customs as stumbling blocks to modernization and human achievement.

Kalicharan realized that the Bodo Society would have to be reformed. "He was filled with anguish and regret to see that the Bodos, although being followers of the [[Bathou]] religion were so only on a very superficial level.They showed little inclination in obeying the principle or guidelines set down by the religion. The worship of many gods and goddesses, whose number were only on the increase, was a clear indication that the people had moved away from their faith." They had become addicted to [[Bodo: जौव|jou]], Rice beer and developed bad social habits. The various social evils were sapping the vitality of the Bodo Society.

Kalicharan felt that the identity and unity of the people could be preserved only though a change in their Society and religion. In 1905, he came across the [[Sarnitya Kriya]] written by [[Mohini Mohan Chattopadhay]]. The book contained the teaching of [[Swami Sibnarayan Paramahansa]]. Kalicharan became convinced that the adoption of the Brahma religion would be able to guide the Bodos towards progress and development and put a stop to the religious conversions. Thus at the age of 39, he got ordained into the folds of [[Brahmaism]] by Swami Sibnarayan at his residence in [[Kolkata]]. He returned to his native village with a determination to spread the religion among the Bodos. According to [[Bidyasagar Narzary]] and [[Malabika Mitra]]'s [[Journey Towards Enlightenment]] " The basic ideology of Brahmaism on which the religion was based was that there was only one God. In Brahma religion this God is worshipped in the form of fire is of primordial importance". "Fire is Brahma and Brahma gives life to the entire Earth and all its beings. Brahma is Universal, endless and all encompassing. Where there is Brahma, there can be found Satya or Truth."

==Death==
He was died on 8 May 1938 due to old age in his village at the age of 78.

'''Marcel Lempereur-Haut''' (1898, [[Liège (city)|Liège]] – 1986, [[Lille]]) was a [[Belgian]] painter. He took drawing lessons at the Liège Academy of Fine Arts where he obtained a diploma in surveying and, after [[World War I]] he worked as a technical [[technical drawing|draughtsman]].

In 1920, he joined the group publishing the ''Anthologie'' art magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=1997 |journal=Revue belge d'archéologie et d'histoire de l'art |publisher=Académie royale d'archéologie de Belgique |volume=66 |pages=149 |issn=0035-077X }}&lt;/ref&gt; He started his artistic career by producing book illustrations and prints, mostly inspired by [[cubism]]. He produced his first [[abstract art]] in 1921, and in 1922 befriended [[František Kupka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Actuel XX: la peinture à Liège au XXe siècle |last=Parisse |first=Jacques |year=1975 |publisher=Editions Mardaga |isbn=978-2-8021-0006-5 |page=170 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1932, he participated in the exhibitions of the [[musicalism|musicalist artists]].

He lived in Paris from 1945 to 1958, and participated in the exhibitions  of the ''[[Salon des Réalités Nouvelles]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Réalités nouvelles: 1946-1956 : [exposition], Musée des beaux-arts de Calais, 9 février-8 avril 1980 |last=Lhotellier |first=Henry |author2=Dominique Viéville |year=1980 |publisher=Musée des beaux-arts de Calais |oclc=8346369 |page=15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At this stage, his work mainly comprised combinations of circles, spirals and stars. His later works were mostly decorative.

Lempereur-Haut continued to paint into at least his late seventies, limiting himself to crayons on cardboard after a [[cataract]] operation in 1976 restricted his vision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Art &amp; ophthalmology: the impact of eye diseases on painters |last=Lanthony |first=Philippe |year=2009 |publisher=Kugler Publications |isbn=978-90-6299-460-1 |pages=82–83 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[retrospective exhibition]] of his work was held in Lille in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Lempereur-Haut, rétrospective: du 18 octobre au 29 décembre 1985 |year=1985 |publisher=Musée d'art moderne, Lille |oclc=464029426 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mariel Hadley Hemingway''' (born November 22, 1961) is an American actress. She began acting at age 14 with a [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]]–nominated breakout role in ''[[Lipstick (1976 film)|Lipstick]]'' (1976), and received [[Academy Awards|Academy]] and [[BAFTA Award]] nominations for her performance in [[Woody Allen]]'s ''[[Manhattan (film)|Manhattan]]'' (1979).

She is also known for her leading roles in  ''[[Personal Best (film)|Personal Best]]'' (1982) and ''[[Star 80]]'' (1983), as well as in the TV series ''[[Civil Wars (TV series)|Civil Wars]]'', for which she received a Golden Globe nomination. Amid [[Mental disorder|mental health]] struggles, Hemingway's career dwindled in the 1990s. She has also starred in and co-produced videos about yoga and holistic living. She published a memoir, ''Finding My Balance'', in 2002, and another, ''Out Came the Sun'', in 2015.

==Early life==
Hemingway was born in [[Mill Valley, California]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.californiabirthindex.org/birth/mariel_h_hemingway_born_1961_7643792|title=Mariel H Hemingway was born on November 22, 1961 in Marin County, California|publisher=californiabirthindex.org|accessdate=2014-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; the third daughter of Byra Louise (née Whittlesey) Hemingway (1922–1988) and [[Jack Hemingway]] (1923–2000), a writer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/98/Mariel-Hemingway.html|title=Mariel Hemingway profile|publisher=Filmreference.com|accessdate=2012-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her sisters are Joan Hemingway (born 1950) and [[Margaux Hemingway]] (1954–1996). Margaux, who was an actress and model, died of a [[phenobarbital|barbiturate]] overdose at age 42 in 1996.

Her paternal grandparents were [[Hadley Richardson]] (1891–1979) and [[Nobel Prize]]–laureate novelist [[Ernest Hemingway]] (1899–1961), who committed suicide four months before she was born. She was named for the Cuban port of [[Mariel, Cuba|Mariel]]—her father and grandfather visited the village regularly to go fishing. Her middle name was her paternal grandmother's. Hemingway grew up primarily in [[Ketchum, Idaho]], where her father lived, and where Ernest had spent time as a sportsman and writer before he died there of suicide.

==Career in film==
Hemingway's first role was with her real-life sister [[Margaux Hemingway|Margaux]] (also in her debut role) in the film ''[[Lipstick (1976 film)|Lipstick]]'' (1976), in which they played sisters. She received notice for her acting and was nominated as "Best Newcomer" for the [[Golden Globe Award]] that year. Her highest profile role came with her role in [[Woody Allen]]'s ''[[Manhattan (film)|Manhattan]]'' (1979), a [[romantic comedy]] in which she plays Tracy, a high school student and Allen's lover. Just 16 during filming (in the film she is said to be 17), she was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]].{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

In her memoir, ''Out Came The Sun'' (2015), Hemingway alleged that Allen attempted to begin a sexual relationship with her shortly after filming was completed, when she had turned 18. Hemingway successfully resisted his advances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vulture.com/2015/03/hemingway-says-woody-allen-tried-to-seduce-her.html|title=Mariel Hemingway Says Woody Allen Tried to Seduce Her at 18|work=Vulture|publisher=New York Media|date=March 25, 2015|accessdate=April 3, 2015|author=Fitz-Gerald, Sean}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howard Kurtz [http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2015/03/25/exclusive-young-mariel-hemingway-had-to-rebuff-woody-allens-advances "Exclusive: Young Mariel Hemingway had to rebuff Woody Allen's advances"], Fox News, March 25, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Helen Nianias [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/woody-allen-mariel-hemingway-granddaughter-of-writer-ernest-claims-director-had-crush-on-her-when-she-was-17-10135298.html "Woody Allen: Mariel Hemingway, granddaughter of writer Ernest, claims director had 'crush' on her when she was 17"], ''The Independent'', March 26, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Personal Best (film)|Personal Best]]'' (1982), she played a [[bisexuality|bisexual]] [[track and field|track-and-field]] athlete in a film noted for some explicit (by mainstream standards) [[lesbian]] love scenes. In connection with ''Personal Best'', she appeared in a nude pictorial in the April 1982 issue of ''[[Playboy]]'' and was on the cover.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}
[[File:Mariel Hemingway by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|left|Hemingway in April 2017]]
She starred as [[Dorothy Stratten]] in ''[[Star 80]]'' (1983), a film about the ''Playboy'' model's life and murder. Reports circulated for years that Hemingway had had her breasts enlarged to play the role of Stratten, but during a 2007 appearance on the late-night [[Talk show|talk]] and [[variety show]], ''[[Fashionably Late with Stacy London]]'', she said she had had the surgery before ''Star 80''. Her [[breast implants]] were removed years later after they had ruptured.&lt;ref&gt;Hemingway, Mariel. ''Finding My Balance''. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 2003.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN, page(s) needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

She was also featured in ''[[Superman IV: The Quest for Peace]]'' (1987) as Lacy Warfield. Subsequently, released additional footage showed an expansion of her role. She also co-starred in the 1991–93 [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] series ''[[Civil Wars (TV series)|Civil Wars]]''. She was cast as the female lead in Darren Star's CBS drama ''[[Central Park West (TV series)|Central Park West]]'' for the 1995-96 season; however, the show fared poorly with both critics and viewers, and after 13 episodes Hemingway was told that the show wanted her to accept a huge pay cut and demotion to recurring character status. She quit the series, which only lasted eight more episodes before being cancelled. In 1996, she had a leading role in the British TV movie ''September'', playing the wife of [[Michael York]].{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

She has played a lesbian or bisexual woman in several films and television shows, including ''Personal Best'', ''[[The Sex Monster]]'', ''[[In Her Line of Fire]]'', and episodes of the TV series ''[[Roseanne]]'' ("[[Don't Ask, Don't Tell (Roseanne)|Don't Ask, Don't Tell]]" and "[[December Bride (Roseanne)|December Bride]]") and ''[[Crossing Jordan]]''. Hemingway, however, is not gay.

In a 2013 television documentary film, ''[[Running from Crazy]]'',&lt;ref name=running&gt;{{cite AV media|people=Kopple, Barbara|date=January 7, 2013|title=Running from Crazy|medium=Motion picture|location=United States|publisher=Oprah Winfrey Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hemingway, then 51, talked of her bouts with [[mental illness]] and her still lingering issues with her siblings.&lt;ref name=wpost/&gt;&lt;ref name=cnn/&gt; She spoke of her family's struggles with alcoholism, mental illnesses and suicide.

You know 'I'm obsessed with my daughters', I don't know why a person can even go there.... I know people would say, 'there's no way in hell your father did that'. And yet, Margaux was obsessed with him, Muffet was obsessed with him, and my mother allowed me to sleep with her my whole childhood practically. I slept with my mom from age seven to age sixteen. But I witnessed it as a kid, so... that's why I thought it never happened to me, because...

'''Maximilian "Maxie" Zeus''' is a [[fictional]] [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic books]] published by DC Comics. He is a delusional criminal mastermind who believes that he is the [[deity|god]] [[Zeus]] and is an occasional enemy of [[Batman]].

==Publication history==
Maxie Zeus first appeared in ''Detective Comics'' #483 (April–May 1979) and was created by [[Denny O'Neil]] and [[Don Newton]].

==Fictional character biography==
Maxie Zeus is a former Greek history teacher who lost his mind when his wife left him. He became a gangster and used his cunning and intelligence to rise to power amidst the chaos in [[Gotham City]]'s underworld. He has fought Batman on several occasions before being committed to [[Arkham Asylum]].

Because Maxie seemed less dangerous than [[Joker (character)|the Joker]], [[Two-Face]], and other notorious Arkham inmates, Arkham's administrators did not commit him in the maximum security wing, despite repeated recommendations from Batman to do so (''Batman and the Outsiders'' #14). Batman's concern was vindicated when Maxie escaped to form a team of Greek Mythology-based superhuman agents called the New Olympians. He attempted to kidnap [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] athlete Lacinia Nitocris and force her to marry him and become a mother to his daughter Medea. This plot was foiled by Batman and the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]], who bested the Olympians in a series of Olympic-style games.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman and the Outsiders'' #14&lt;/ref&gt;

Maxie was one of the villains that escaped Arkham when [[Bane (comics)|Bane]] brought down the walls of Arkham Asylum in the ''[[Batman: Knightfall|Knightfall]]'' storyline. Maxie's escape attempt was disrupted when he collided with a tree.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman'' #491&lt;/ref&gt;

Some time later, however, he was drawn into a plot engineered by the [[Children of Ares]]—[[Deimos (mythology)|Deimos]], [[Phobos (mythology)|Phobos]]—and [[Eris (mythology)|Eris]] (Ares' sister) to merge Gotham City with [[Ares (DC Comics)|Ares]]' throne capital, the Aeropagus. The intent was to re-establish Ares' rule on earth. Maxie was killed as a result of that plot, and his sacrifice brought about Ares' return. However, their scheme was foiled by [[Wonder Woman]], Batman and their allies, and Ares himself banished his children back to [[Tartarus]].

In issues of ''[[Robin (comics)|Robin]]'', a vigilante called Violet was trying to track down an illegal casino named "Maxie's", with chips bearing a Zeus-like profile. Presumably, Maxie survived his encounter with the Children of Ares. After Violet was discovered by Maxie Zeus's guards, both Robin and Violet managed to escape unharmed as detectives that Robin was working with on the case raid the casino and arrest Maxie Zeus, who surrenders without a fight after an officer physically threatened him.

Maxie returns in [[Kevin Smith]]'s ''[[Batman: Cacophony]]''. Apparently cured of his delusions, he has been hired by the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] to use Joker Venom on random people on April First as an [[April Fool's Day]] joke, but instead mixes the poison with ecstasy to produce a new designer drug called "Chuckles". He uses the profits to fund his empire as well as building his dream of creating a public school that is run like a private school. The Joker, angry that his creation is being used for a noble purpose, swears revenge against Maxie. After witnessing the death of his nephew and a dozen other children when the Joker blows up a school, Maxie suffers a psychotic break and reverts to his Zeus persona. After Batman rescues him from an attack by the Joker at a nightclub, he visits Maxie again at his penthouse. After temporarily restoring Maxie's sanity with a massive dose of antipsychotics, Batman convinces him to confess and turn himself in to the police. This move is later revealed to be part of Batman's plan to lure the Joker and [[Onomatopoeia (comics)|Onomatopoeia]] out of hiding.

In September 2011, [[The New 52]] rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, in the ''[[Batman Eternal]]'' story, Maxie Zeus is used as a host for the spirit of [[Deacon Blackfire]] as he attempts to use the spirits of the Arkham Asylum inmates to return to life only to be thwarted by [[Batwing (DC Comics)|Batwing]] and [[Jim Corrigan]].&lt;ref&gt;''Batman Eternal'' #17&lt;/ref&gt; Following Arkham Asylum's destruction, [[Maggie Sawyer]] attempts to get answers from Maxie Zeus on what happened.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman Eternal'' #44&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other versions==
===''Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth''===
An electrified, emaciated version of Maxie Zeus appears in the graphic novel ''[[Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth]]'' by [[Grant Morrison]] and [[Dave McKean]]. Batman finds him connected to the electroshock therapy room of [[Arkham Asylum]], perpetually receiving electrical currents, which he believes to be "fire from heaven". On the one occasion in the story in which he and Batman cross paths, he compares himself to the supreme gods in many mythologies. He also does not recognize Batman, warmly addressing him as "a pilgrim". Early drafts of the script describes Zeus as resembling his original comic book counterpart, but with female breasts and genitalia crudely drawn on his filthy toga.

===''The Batman Adventures''===
In ''[[The Batman Adventures]]'' (a comic series based on the animated series), Maxie Zeus escapes Arkham Asylum several times and teams up with villains such as [[Lex Luthor]] and [[Ra's al Ghul]] to destroy Gotham. Each time, he is foiled by Batman and Robin and returned to Arkham.

===''The Batman Strikes!''===
In an issue of ''[[The Batman Strikes!]]'', Maxie Zeus joins a group of villains led by the Joker. However, it is revealed that this is a simulation created by Batman to train Robin. On a later issue, Maxie Zeus goes on a criminal rampage alongside [[Rag Doll (comics)|Ragdoll]], [[Spellbinder (DC Comics)|Spellbinder]], and an Everywhere Man, but is defeated by Batgirl.

===''Batman Beyond''===
In the ''[[Batman Beyond (comics)|Batman Beyond]]'' comic series, [[Bruce Wayne|Bruce]] tells [[Terry McGinnis|Terry]] a secured location where he has kept some of his most disturbed rogues in captivity. Maxie Zeus and [[Mad Hatter (comics)|Mad Hatter]] were among the catatonic inhabitants. It's possible that Maxie has suffered a deal from eletro shock which could have been brought on by the crude methods at [[Arkham Asylum]] or by his delusions of godhood which forced him to wield a lightning discharging staff.

==In other media==

===Television===
[[Image:Maxie zeus.jpg|thumb|right|Maxie Zeus as seen in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]''.]]
* Maxie Zeus appears in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', voiced by [[Steve Susskind]]. He is depicted as a shipping tycoon with underworld connections. He carries a metal rod in the shape of a [[thunderbolt]] (shown in the picture at right), which he uses to electrocute his victims into unconsciousness. In his debut episode "Fire From Olympus", he loses his mind after recovering from a serious financial crisis and faces a criminal conviction for smuggling. The stress of dealing with these causes him to develop a god complex and he starts to believe that he is the Greek god [[Zeus]], and that his girlfriend is the muse [[Clio]]. When Batman arrives at the top of his building, Maxie believes he is [[Hades]], as "no mortal can reach [[Mount Olympus]]" without his permission, and even calls the Caped Crusader his "brother". Maxie steals an electron discharge cannon, which he uses on "pitiful mortals" who dare to oppose him. When Clio tries to stop him and bring him back to his senses, he has her bound to the barrel of the electron cannon by his henchmen, though she is saved by Batman before she can be killed. Maxie is eventually subdued by Batman with help from Clio. While being dragged through [[Arkham Asylum]], he looks at the prisoners watching him and believes that he sees a Greek [[deity]] in their place: [[Joker (character)|Joker]] is the [[trickster god]] [[Hermes]], [[Two-Face]] is the "double-faced" [[Janus]] (actually a [[Roman mythology|Roman god]]), and [[Poison Ivy (character)|Poison Ivy]] is the goddess [[Demeter]]. His last line is "''Now at last, Mighty Zeus is home''".
* Maxie Zeus appears in ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'', voiced by [[Phil LaMarr]]. In this interpretation, he wears a high-tech armor with gloves that generate electricity. The [[gladiator]] armor suit he wears is more similar to Roman mythology than Greek. It is also notable that this version of the character despises being called "Maxie", preferring "Maximilian". In the episode "Thunder", Maxie is an eccentric multimillionaire and owner of Zeus Industries, who is obsessed with Greek mythology. He runs for mayor against [[Marion Grange]], but loses the election after announcing his plan to revolutionize the [[Gotham City Police Department]] after his own gladiator-themed security forces. Angered by his defeat, Maxie rides in his airship New Olympus in order to make Gotham City his own personal kingdom. Batman and [[Barbara Gordon|Batgirl]] defeat Maxie Zeus, where New Olympus "became the New [[Atlantis]]". In "Rumors", Maxie Zeus reappears as one of the many villains captured by the villain Rumor.

===Film===
Though Maxie Zeus does not appear in ''[[Batman: Assault on Arkham]]'', a box with his tools is found by [[King Shark]] along with [[Firefly (DC Comics)|Firefly]]'s tools and [[Killer Moth]]'s tools.

===Video games===
* Maxie Zeus appears as an enemy in ''[[Batman (NES)|Batman]]''.
* Maxie Zeus appears as an unlockable bio in ''[[Batman: Arkham Asylum]]''. His cell (which contains a book on Greek mythology and has Greek symbols drawn on the wall) is found adjacent to the asylum's [[electroshock therapy|ECT]] room in the Intensive Treatment's Patient Pacification Center.
* In ''[[Batman: Arkham City]]'', although Maxie Zeus doesn't appear, his nightclub, called the "Gotham City Olympus", can be found at the Amusement Mile in Arkham City, between the Gotham Casino and the old Gotham City Police Department building. Scanning the statue at the front's lightning bolt will unlock an Arkham City Story explaining that Maxie has disappeared after a few electro-shock therapy sessions. Despite his status, his nightclub continues to run on schedule.

{{History_of_Albania}}

The '''[[Albanians]]''' ({{lang-sq|Shqiptarët}}) and their country '''[[Albania]]''' (''Shqipëria'') have been identified by many ethnonyms. The native [[endonym]] is [[Shqiptar]]. The name "Albanians" ([[Byzantine Greek]]: ''Albanoi/Arbanitai/Albanites'';  [[Latin]]: ''Albanenses/Arbanenses'') was used in medieval Greek and Latin documents that gradually entered European languages from which other similar derivative names emerged.&lt;ref name="Elsie200534"/&gt; Linguists believe that the ''alb'' part in the root word originates from an Indo-European term for a type of mountainous topography, meaning "hill, mountain", also present in ''[[Alps]]''.&lt;ref name="Malcolm29"/&gt; Through the root word ''alban'' and its [[Rhotacism (sound change)|rhotacized]] equivalents ''arban'', ''albar'', and ''arbar'', the term in Albanian became rendered as ''Arbëreshë'' ({{lang-aln|Arbëneshë}}) for the people and ''Arbëria'' ({{lang-aln|Arbënia}}) for the country.&lt;ref name="Elsie200534"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lloshi277"/&gt;

Contemporary Albanian language employs a different ethnonym, with modern Albanians referring to themselves as ''Shqiptarë'' and to their country as ''Shqipëria''.&lt;ref name="Lloshi277"/&gt; Two etymologies have been proposed for this ethnonym: one, derived the name from the Albanian word for eagle (shqiponjë).&lt;ref name="Kamusella241"/&gt; The [[eagle]] was a common heraldic symbol for many Albanian dynasties in the Late Middle Ages and came to be a symbol of the Albanians in general, for example the flag of [[Skanderbeg]], whose family symbol was the black double-headed eagle, as displayed on the [[Albanian flag]].&lt;ref&gt;Elsie 2010, "Flag, Albanian", p. 140: "The eagle was a common heraldic symbol for many Albanian dynasties in the Late Middle Ages and came to be a symbol of the Albanians in general. It is also said to have been the flag of Skanderbeg...As a symbol of modern Albania, the flag began to be seen during the years of the national awakening and was in common use during the uprisings of 1909-1912. It was this flag that Ismail Qemal bey Vlora raised in Vlora on 28 November 1912 in proclaiming Albanian independence."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Flag Bulletin|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=wjIrAQAAIAAJ|publisher = Flag Research Center.|date = 1987-01-01|language = en|quote = History records that the 15th century Albanian national hero, Skanderbeg (i.e. George Kastriota), had raised the red flag with the black eagle over his ancestral home, the Fortress of Kruje}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Scanderbeg: From Ottoman Captive to Albanian Hero|last = Hodgkison|first = Harry|publisher = |year = 2005|isbn = 1-85043-941-9|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ej2-s"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=ALBANCI | encyclopedia =[[Enciklopedija Jugoslavije]] 2nd ed. | volume=Supplement | pages=1 | publisher=[[JLZ]] | location=[[Zagreb]] | year=1984 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kamusella241"/&gt; The other is within scholarship that connects it to the verb 'pronounce' (''shqiptoj''), cognating with Latin ''excipere''. In this instance the Albanian [[endonym]] like [[Endonym#Tendencies in the development of exonyms|many others]] would originally have been a term connoting "those who speak [intelligibly, the same language]".&lt;ref name="Kamusella241"/&gt; The new ethnonyms ''Shqiptarë'' and ''Shqipëria'' emerged and replaced the older ethnonyms ''Arbëreshë'' and ''Arbëria'' amongst Albanian speakers between the late 17th and early 18th centuries.&lt;ref name="Lloshi277"/&gt; That era brought about religious and other sociopolitical changes.&lt;ref name="Lloshi277"/&gt; As such a new and generalised response by Albanians based on ethnic and linguistic consciousness to this new and different Ottoman world emerging around them was a change in ethnonym.&lt;ref name="Lloshi277"/&gt;

''Arbën'', ''Arbëneshë'', ''Arbënuer'' (as rendered in northern [[Gheg]] dialects) and ''Arbër'', ''Arbëreshë'', ''Arbëror'' (as rendered in southern [[Tosk]] dialects) are the old native terms denoting ancient and medieval Albanians used by Albanians.&lt;ref name="Lloshi277"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BardhylDemiraj534"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Ethnic Groups of Europe: An Encyclopedia" Jeffrey E.

"Albanian is an Indo-European language, but like modern Greek and Armenian, it does not have any other closely related living language. Within the Indo-European family, it forms a group of its own. In Albanian, the language is called shqip. Albania is called ''Shqipëri'', and the Albanians call themselves ''shqiptarë''. Until the fifteenth century the language was known as ''Arbërisht'' or ''Arbnisht'', which is still the name used for the language in Italy and Greece. The Greeks refer to all the varieties of Albanian spoken in Greece as Arvanitika. In the second century AD, Ptolemy, the Alexandrian mathematician, astronomer and geographer, used the name ''Albanoi'' to refer to an Illyrian tribe that used to live in what is now central Albania. During the Middle Ages the population of that area was referred to as ''Arbanori'' or ''Albanon''. It is clear that the words ''Arbëresh'', ''Arvanitika'', and even ''Albanian'' and ''Albania'' are all related to the older name of the language."&lt;/ref&gt; located in modern-day central Albania, near the city of [[Krujë]].&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm 1998, p. 29. "Nor is there any mystery about the origin of this name. In the second century Ptolemy referred to a tribe called the 'Albanoi', and located their town, 'Albanopolis', somewhere to the east of Durres."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ramadan Marmullaku - 1975, ''Albania and the Albanians'' - Page 5&lt;/ref&gt; The ''alb'' part in the root word for all these terms is believed by linguists be an [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] word for a type of mountainous topography, meaning "hill, mountain", also present in ''[[Alps]]''.&lt;ref name="Malcolm29"&gt;{{harvnb|Malcolm|1998|p=29}}. "Linguists believe that the ‘Alb-’ element comes from the Indo-European word for a type of mountainous terrain, from which the word ‘Alps’ is also derived."&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Lab'', also ''Labe'', ''Labi''; Albanian sub-group and geographic/ethnographic region of ''Labëri'', definite: ''[[Labëria]]'' in Albania are also endonyms formed from the root ''alb''.&lt;ref name="Viereck122"/&gt; These are derived from the syllable cluster ''alb'' undergoing metathesis within Slavic to ''lab'' and [[Reborrowing|reborrowed]] in that form into Albanian.&lt;ref name="Viereck122"&gt;{{harvnb|Viereck|1993|p=122}}. "Die besondere ethnische Stellung der Labëri tritt auch in den Benennungen ''lab'' 'Labe', ''Labëri'', Arbëri hervor, die von der Wurzel *''alb''-/*''arb''- gebildet sind und die alte Selbstbenennung der Albaner enthalten. Der Bewohner von Labëri wird auch jetzt lab, best. ''labi'' genannt, eig. ‘der Albaner’. Der Wandel *''alb''- &gt; ''lab'' zeigt die für das Slawische typische metatheseerscheinung. [The particular ethnic position of ''Labëri'' emerges also in the names lab, 'Labe', Labëri, Arbëri that from the root *''alb''-/*''arb''- formed and included the old self-designation of the Albanians. The residents of Labëri is also now lab, spec. ''labi'' called proper 'the Albanians'. The change *''alb''&gt;''lab'' shows the typical metathesis for the Slavic.]"&lt;/ref&gt;

Terms derived from all those endonyms as exonyms appear in Byzantine sources from the eleventh century onward and are rendered as ''Albanoi'', ''Arbanitai'' and ''Arbanites'' and in Latin and other Western documents as ''Albanenses'' and ''Arbanenses''.&lt;ref name="Elsie200534"&gt;{{harvnb|Elsie|2005|pp=3–4}}.

London: Macmillan, 1998, p.29 "The name used in all these references is, allowing for linguistic variations, the same: 'Albanenses' or 'Arbanenses' in Latin, 'Albanoi' or 'Arbanitai' in Byzantine Greek. (The last of these, with an internal switching of consonants, gave rise to the Turkish form 'Arnavud', from which 'Arnaut' was later derived.)"&lt;/ref&gt; The first Byzantine writers to mention [[Albanians]] in an ethnic sense are  [[Michael Attaliates]] (in the book ''History'') and [[Anna Comnena]] (in the book ''[[Alexiad]]''), referring to them as ''Albanoi'' and ''Arbanitai'', in the 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;Michaelis Attaliotae: ''Historia'', Bonn 1853, p. 8, 18, 297&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Comnena, Anna.

''Arbanas'' (Арбанас), plural: ''Arbanasi'' (Арбанаси); is the old [[ethnonym]] that the [[South Slavs]], such as the [[Bulgarians]] and [[Serbs]], used to denote [[Albanians]], dating back to the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name="Kamusella241"/&gt; While ''Arbanaski'' (Арбанаски), ''Arbanski'' (Арбански) and ''Arbanaški'' (Арбанашки) were adjectives derived from those terms.&lt;ref name="ZbornikzaIstocnjacku745"&gt;{{harvnb|Zbornik za Istocnjacku Istorisku i Knjizevnu Gradu|1940|p=745}}.

[''Arbanas'', ''arbanaski'', ''arbanski'' and ''arbanaški'' and all of the same grounds derived words have come from ''Arbanus''.]"&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''Arbănas'' was also used by Romanians for Albanians.&lt;ref name="Kamusella241"/&gt; They first appear with this ethnonym in a Bulgarian manuscript dated 1000-1018, during the reign of [[Tsar Samuel]], in which  Arbanasi (Albanians) are mentioned as being half-believers (i.e. non-Orthodox Christians).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.albanianhistory.net/1000_Origins-of-Nations/  Robert Elsie Texts and Documents of Albanian History], "1000 — 1018 Anonymous: Fragment on the Origins of Nations"&lt;/ref&gt; The term was in use amongst South Slavs until the mid 20th century. The name ''[[Arbanas]]i'' is still used as an exonym for a small Albanian community in Croatia on the Dalmatian coast that migrated there during the 18th century.&lt;ref name="Barancic551"&gt;{{harvnb|Barančić|2008|p=551}}. "Možemo reći da svi na neki način pripadamo nekoj vrsti etničke kategorije, a često i više nego jednoj. Kao primjer navodim slučaj zadarskih Arbanasa. Da bismo shvatili Arbanase i problem njihova etnojezičnog (etničkog i jezičnog) identiteta, potrebno je ići u povijest njihova doseljenja koje seže u početak 18. st., tj. točnije: razdoblje od prve seobe 1726., razdoblje druge seobe od 1733., pa sve do 1754. godine koja se smatra završnom godinom njihova doseljenja. Svi su se doselili iz tri sela s područja Skadarskog jezera - Briske, Šestana i Livara. Bježeći od Turaka, kuge i ostalih nevolja, generalni providur Nicola Erizzo II dozvolio im je da se nasele u područje današnjih Arbanasa i Zemunika. Jedan dio stanovništva u Zemuniku se asimilirao s ondašnjim stanovništvom zaboravivši svoj jezik. To su npr. današnji Prenđe, Šestani, Ćurkovići, Paleke itd. Drugi dio stanovništva je nastojao zadržati svoj etnički i jezični identitet tijekom ovih 280 godina. Dana 10. svibnja 2006. godine obilježena je 280. obljetnica njihova dolaska u predgrađe grada Zadra. Nije bilo lako, osobito u samom početku, jer nisu imali svoju crkvu, škole itd., pa je jedini način održavanja njihova identiteta i jezika bio usmenim putem. We can say that all in some way belong to a kind of ethnic category, and often more than one. As an example, I cite the case of Zadar Arbanasi. To understand the problem of the Albanians and their ethnolinguistic (ethnic and linguistic) identity, it is necessary to go into the history of their immigration that goes back to the beginning of the 18th century., etc more precisely: the period from the first migration of 1726, the period of the second migration of 1733, and until 1754, which is considered to be the final year of their immigration. All they moved from three villages from the area of Lake Scutari - Briska, Šestan and Livara. Fleeing from the Ottomans, plague and other troubles, the general provider Nicola Erizzo II allowed them to settle in the area of today's Arbanasa and Zemunik. One part of the population in Zemunik became assimilated with the local population, forgetting their language. These are for example, today's Prenda, Šestani, Ćurkovići, Paleke etc. The second part of the population tried to maintain their ethnic and linguistic identity during these 280 years. On May 10, 2006 marked the 280th anniversary of their arrival in the suburb of Zadar. It was not easy, especially in the beginning, because they did not have their own church, school, etc., and is the only way to maintain their identity and language was verbally."&lt;/ref&gt; In modern South Slavic languages the term is ''Albanac''.&lt;ref&gt;Mirdita, Zef (1969).

''Arvanitis'' (Αρβανίτης), plural: ''[[Arvanites]]'' (Αρβανίτες); is a term that was historically used amongst the wider Greek-speaking population to describe an Albanian speaker regardless of their religious affiliations until the interwar period, alongside with ''Alvanoi'' (Αλβανοί).&lt;ref name="Baltsiotis9"/&gt; The name  was established in [[Greek language]] from the original [[ethnonym]] ''Alvanitis'' (Άλβανίτης), which in return derived from ''Alvanos'' (Άλβάνος).&lt;ref name="Theissen90"/&gt; The name appears as the ethnonym of ''Albanians'' in medieval Byzantine sources, originally as "Arbanitai",&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm, Noel. "Kosovo, a short history". London: Macmillan, 1998, p. 29 "The name used in all these references is, allowing for linguistic variations, the same: 'Albanenses' or 'Arbanenses' in Latin, 'Albanoi' or 'Arbanitai' in Byzantine Greek.

Today, the term ''Arvanites'' is used by Greeks to refer to descendants of Albanians or ''Arbëreshë'' that migrated to southern Greece during the medieval era and who currently self identify as Greeks, as a result of assimilation.&lt;ref name="Liakos230"&gt;{{harvnb|Liakos|2012|p=230}}. "The term "Arvanite" is the medieval equivalent of "Albanian." it is retained today for the descendants of the Albanian tribes that migrated to the Greek lands during a period covering two centuries, from the thirteenth to the fifteenth."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Liotta198"&gt;{{harvnb|Liotta|2001|p=198}}. "Among Greeks, the term "Alvanitis"—or "Arvanitis"—means a Christian of Albanian ancestry, one who speaks both Greek and Albanian, but possesses Greek "consciousness." Numerous "Arvanites" live in Greece today, although the ability to speak both languages is shrinking as the differences (due to technology and information access and vastly different economic bases) between Greece and Albania increase.

"Until the Interwar period ''Arvanitis'' (plural ''Arvanitēs'') was the term used by Greek speakers to describe an Albanian speaker regardless of his/hers religious background. In official language of that time the term ''Alvanos'' was used instead. The term ''Arvanitis'' coined for an Albanian speaker independently of religion and citizenship survives until today in Epirus (see Lambros Baltsiotis and Léonidas Embirikos, "De la formation d’un ethnonyme. Le terme Arvanitis et son evolution dans l’État hellénique", in G. Grivaud-S. Petmezas (eds.), ''Byzantina et Moderna'', Alexandreia, Athens, 2006, pp. 417-448."&lt;/ref&gt; While the term ''Arvanitika'' (Αρβανίτικα) is used within Greece for all varieties of the Albanian language spoken there, whereas within Western academia the term is used for the Albanian language spoken in Southern Greece.&lt;ref name="Friedman218219"&gt;{{harvnb|Friedman|2009|pp=218–219}}. "Botsi's chapter on Arvanitika also gives much useful information but contains some unfortunate errors. The northern dialect of Albanian is Geg, not Gjeg (47 ''et passim''), and the formulation "... Albanian does not constitute the direct descendent of an (one?) Indo-European language ..." is flat out wrong. While it is true that we are not certain ''which'' lndo-European language Albanian is directly descended from, it is as much the descendent of a single language as Greek or French. The claim that Greek and Latin are "at the origin of Albanian polygensis" (48) is mistaken. To be sure, Albanian was heavily influenced by Latin (much less by Greek, especially in the north), but the core grammar and vocabulary represent a distinct and different branch of Indo-European. The primary shape of the root ''alban''- in deriving the various forms of the relevant name is not clearly presented and the forms Shqipëria (Geg ''Shqipnia'') and ''Shqip(ë)tar'' are misspelled. The use of ''Arvanitika'' to cover all the Albanian-speakers of Greece no doubt reflects popular Greek usage, but in the North American academic community, this label is restricted to those dialects of Greece for which the term of self-ascription is ''Arbërisht'' rather than ''Shqip''. This latter term, which apparently came into use in the 15th century and is derived from an adverb meaning ‘[speak] clearly,’ is used by the Çams as well as in the villages near Florina, Konitsa, in Thrace and, we can add, in Mandres near Kilkis (an enclave that arrived from Mandrica in what is now Bulgaria as a result of the Balkan Wars, although the dialect is now moribund or dead [Eric Hamp, p.c., see Hamp 1965 for more data]). From a strictly dialectological point of view, what we can call Arvanitika proper (''Southern Arvanitika'' in Botsi's terms) represents the southernmost extension of the Albanian dialect continuum with a consistent and gradual development of isoglosses. Arbëresh, on the other hand, shows a diversity of Tosk dialects, the ancestors of whose speakers must have come from all along the western part of the Northern Tosk-Lab-Çam-Arvanitika continuum (Eric Hamp, p.c.). While Arvanitika proper broke off directly from southern cam, the non-cam dialects of Epirus., Macedonia and Thrace are all the results of later northern Tosk migrations."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Trudgill32"&gt;{{harvnb|Trudgill|1977|p=32}}. "It is not too widely known that a majority of villages in the Athens area of Greece are inhabited by people of Albanian rather than Greek ethnic origin. These people are not recent immigrants, but the descendants of Albanians who entered the country at various times, for the most part between the 11th and 15th centuries. These Greek Albanians long retained a clearly separate ethnic identity, apparently, but gradually this identity has been eroded. Today they refer to themselves not as Albanians but as Arvanites, and call the language they speak not Albanian but Arvanitika. They are also very concerned to explain to outsiders that they are not only Arvanites but Greeks as well (see Trudgill and Tzavaras, forthcoming). The result of this development is that the main, perhaps only identifying characteristic of the Greek Albanians is now their language."&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside these ethnonyms the term ''Arvanitia'' (Αρβανιτιά) for the country has also been used by Greek society in folklore, sayings, riddles, dances and toponyms.&lt;ref name="Albanohellenica127"&gt;{{harvnb|Albanian-Greek Philological Association|1999|=127}}.

"During the period of the Ottoman domination the geographic entity of Epirus was a matter of great study for the scholars and the geographers of the time. The way the subject was dealt with was mainly a matter of the ideological perspective of each scholar and of his academic and cultural background, a factor that differentiates both them and the definitions that each one gives. It can be observed that scholars who were influenced by the Ancient Greeks favoured an approach based on Ptolemy's theory that the boundaries of Epirus are the Akrokeravnia mountain range, while those inclined to Byzantine opinions added areas of what was once New Epirus such as Avlona and Dyrrachio. All of them, though, were obliged to determine the differences between the ancient term of Epirus and the new term ''Arvanitia'' or ''Albania'', the area of which was similarly disputed. We will confine ourselves to the references of a few scholars of the period of Ottoman domination, particularly those that belong chronologically near the era we are studying. For A. Psalida, "''Albania'', (former Illyricon and Epirus) is bordered to the east by the lower parts of Macedonia and Thessaly, to the north by Bosnan and Serbia, to the west by the Ionian Sea and to the south by the Gulf of Amvrakia", a perception without any ethnological basis which reflects the literature of the period. The writer uses the word Albania, the scholars’ way of expressing the older Greek term ''Arvanitia'', to refer to Epirus. "Albania consists of two toparchies or kingdoms, one of Epirus and one of Illyricon", the writer continues. With this revision he places the river Aoos as a border between Epirus and Illyricon - Ano Arvanitia (upper Arvanitia), a notion which his student Kosmas the Thesprotian also adopts to define Albania. "Albania to the west is bordered by the Adriatic Sea, to the east by the western parts of Macedonia, to the north by Bosnan, Dalmatia and Montenegro and to the south by Epirus, from which it is divided by the river Viosa or Vousa". In these descriptions it is obvious that Avlona is also included inside the borders of Epirus, although the ancient treatise clearly places it in Macedonia (Ptolemy). A few years later, at the time of the Greek revolution, Psalidas refutes, for obvious reasons, the term ''Arvanitia'' and comments: "Epirus is wrongly referred to as Arvanitia, since no one there knows how to speak Arvanitika (Albanian)". The Bishop of Athens, Meletios, in the old and new Geography (1728) defines two terms, ''Arvanitia'' which constitutes the western part of Macedonia, and the Old Epirus. The two regions are divided by the river Kelidno, which the writer identifies as a river in the area of Liapouria. We observe that this opinion coincides with Ptolemy’s scheme (Γ′, 12, 4.) to which the latest term, ''Arvanitia'', is now added. As a subdivision of ''Arvanitia'', Meletios newly introduces the old-Byzantine term of ''New Epirus'' in which he includes the lands between Hemmara and Dirrachio. In "Modern Geography", the Dimitries restore the boundary to Akrokeravnia mountain, which was the ancient Greeks line of demarcation for the lands of the area. They place the ''lower part of Arvanitia'' (''Kato Arvanitia'') in western Macedonia. All the rest of the geographical or ethnological approaches of the 18th and 19th century are theoretical texts that duplicate more or less the views mentioned above. It can be said that in general there is a tendency to identify the political transformations that occur over time with the determination of geographical boundaries and names."&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries due to socio-political disturbances by some Albanians in the Balkans the term was used as an ethnic marker for Albanians in addition to the usual [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|millet]] religious terminology to identify people in Ottoman state records.&lt;ref name="Anscombe200688"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Anscombe772"/&gt; While the term used in Ottoman sources for the country was ''Arnavudluk'' (آرناوودلق) for areas such as Albania, Western Macedonia, Southern Serbia, Kosovo, parts of northern Greece and southern Montenegro.&lt;ref name="Anscombe200688"&gt;{{harvnb|Anscombe|2006|pp=88}}. "This Albanian participation in brigandage is easier to track than for many other social groups in Ottoman lands, because Albanian (''Arnavud'') was one of the relatively few ethnic markers regularly added to the usual religious (Muslim-Zimmi) tags used to identify people in state records. These records show that the magnitude of banditry involving Albanians grew through the 1770s and 1780s to reach crisis proportions in the 1790s and 1800s."; p.107. "In light of the recent violent troubles in Kosovo and Macedonia and the strong emotions tied to them, readers are urged most emphatically not to draw either of two unwarranted conclusions from this article:  that Albanians are somehow inherently inclined to banditry, or that the extent of Ottoman "Albania" or ''Arnavudluk'' (which included parts of present-day northern Greece, western Macedonia, southern Montenegro, Kosovo, and southern Serbia) gives any historical "justification" for the creation of a "Greater Albania" today."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Anscombe772"&gt;{{harvnb|Anscombe|2006b|p=772}}. "In this case, however, Ottoman records contain useful information about the ethnicities of the leading actors in the story. In comparison with ‘Serbs’, who were not a meaningful category to the Ottoman state, its records refer to ‘Albanians’ more frequently than to many other cultural or linguistic groups. The term ‘Arnavud’ was used to denote persons who spoke one of the dialects of Albanian, came from mountainous country in the western Balkans (referred to as ‘Arnavudluk’, and including not only the area now forming the state of Albania but also neighbouring parts of Greece, Macedonia, Kosovo, and Montenegro), organized society on the strength of blood ties (family, clan, tribe), engaged predominantly in a mix of settled agriculture and livestock herding, and were notable fighters — a group, in short, difficult to control.

The term ''Albanesi'' was used for some Balkan troops recruited (mid 18th - early 19th centuries) by the [[Kingdom of Naples]] that indicated their general origins (without implying ethnic connotations) or fighting style, due to the reputation Albanians held of serving as mercenaries in Ottoman armies.&lt;ref name="Pappas42"&gt;{{harvnb|Pappas|1981|p=42.}} "In the eighty odd years during which Naples employed light infantry from the Balkans, the troops of the regiment and its successors were known popularly under three names... the seemingly national names of Greci, Albanesi, and Macedoni. These names did not, however, have their later ethnic connotations but were instead stylized terms that described the soldiers’ general origins or mode of fighting... The term Albanesi was used because that nation had achieved fame for its style of fighting as mercenaries of the Ottoman Empire. Muslim Albanians had become a mainstay of the sultan’s armies and were given the nickname "the Swiss of the Near East” by Europeans."&lt;/ref&gt;

''Shqip(ë)tar'' and ''Shqyptar'' (in northern Albanian dialects) is the contemporary [[Exonym and endonym|endonym]] used by Albanians for themselves while ''Shqipëria'' and ''Shqypnia/Shqipnia'' are native [[Toponymy|toponyms]] used by Albanians to name their country.&lt;ref name="Lloshi277"/&gt; All terms share the same Albanian root ''shqipoj'' that is derived from the Latin ''excipere'' with both terms carrying the meaning of "to speak clearly, to understand".&lt;ref name="Kamusella241"/&gt; While the Albanian public favours the explanation that the self-ethnonym is derived from the Albanian word for eagle ''shqipe'' that is displayed on the national Albanian flag.&lt;ref name="Kamusella241"&gt;{{harvnb|Kamusella|2009|p=241}}. "Prior to the emergence of the modern self-ethnonym ''Shqiptarë'' in the mid-16th century (for the first time it was recorded in 1555 by the Catholic Gheg, Gjon Buzuku, in his missal), North Albanians (Ghegs) referred to themselves as ''Arbën'', and South Albanians (Tosks) ''Arbër''. Hence, the self-ethnonym ''Arbëreshë'' of the present-day Italo-Albanians (numbering about 100,000) in southern Italy and Sicily, whose ancestors, in the wake of the Ottoman wars, emigrated from their homeland in the 14th century. These self-ethnonyms perhaps influenced the Byzantine Greek Arvanites for ‘Albanians,’ which was followed by similar ones in Bulgarian and Serbian (''Arbanasi''), Ottoman (''Arnaut''), Romanian (''Arbănas''), and Aromanian (''Arbineş''). It is clear that scholars and Albanians themselves agree that they do not agree on any single etymology of the ethnonym ‘Albanian.’ A similar predicament is faced by the self-ethnonym ''Shqiptarë''. The most popular scholarly explanation is that it was formed by analogy to ‘Slavs’ (*''Slovene''), believed to be derived from ''slovo'' (‘word’), and by extension, from *''sluti'' (‘to speak clearly.’) The last explanation semantically contrasts with Slavic ''Niemiec'' (‘mute,’‘stammering,’‘babbling’), and Greek ‘barbarian’ (from ''barbaros'' ‘those who stammer, babble’). Hence, ''Shqiptarë'' could be derived from Albanian ''shqipoi'' (from Latin ''excipere'') for ‘to speak clearly, to understand.’ The Albanian public favors the belief that their self-ethnonym stems from ''shqipe'' (‘eagle’) found on the Albanian national flag."&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 17th and beginning of the early 18th centuries, the placename ''Shqipëria'' and the ethnic demonym ''Shqiptarë'' gradually replaced ''Arbëria/Arbënia'' and ''Arbëresh/Arbënesh'' amongst Albanian speakers.&lt;ref name="Lloshi277"/&gt; This was due to socio-political, cultural, economic and religious complexities and changes that Albanians experienced during the Ottoman era.&lt;ref name="Lloshi277"&gt;{{harvnb|Lloshi|1999|p=277}}. "The Albanians of today call themselves ''shqiptarë'', their country ''Shqipëri'', and their language ''shqipe''. These terms came into use between the end of the 17th and beginning of the 18th centuries. Foreigners call them ''albanesi'' (Italian), ''Albaner'' (German), ''Albanians'' (English), ''Alvanos'' (Greek), and ''Arbanasi'' (old Serbian), the country ''Albania'', ''Albanie'', ''Albanien'', ''Alvania'', and ''Albanija'', and the language ''Albanese'', ''Albanisch'', ''Albanian'', ''Alvaniki'', and ''Arbanashki'' respectively. All these words are derived from the name ''Albanoi'' of an Illyrian tribe and their center ''Albanopolis'', noted by the astronomer of Alexandria, Ptolemy, in the 2nd century AD. ''Alban'' could he a plural of ''alb''- ''arb''-, denoting the inhabitants of the plains (ÇABEJ 1976). The name passed over the boundaries of the Illyrian tribe in central Albania, and was generalised for all the Albanians. They called themselves ''arbënesh'', ''arbëresh'', the country ''Arbëni'', ''Arbëri'', and the language ''arbëneshe'', ''arbëreshe''. In the foreign languages, the Middle Ages denominations of these names survived, but for the Albanians they were substituted by ''shqiptarë'', ''Shqipëri'' and ''shqipe''. The primary root is the adverb ''shqip'', meaning "clearly, intelligibly". There is a very close semantic parallel to this in the German noun ''Deutsche'', "the Germans" and "the German language" (Lloshi 1984) Shqip spread out from the north to the south, and ''Shqipni/Shqipëri'' is probably a collective noun, following the common pattern of ''Arbëni'', ''Arbëri''. The change happened after the Ottoman conquest because of the conflict in the whole line of the political, social, economic, religious, and cultural spheres with a totally alien world of the Oriental type. A new and more generalised ethnic and linguistic consciousness of all these people responded to this."&lt;/ref&gt; ''Skipetar'' is a historical rendering or [[Exonym and endonym|exonym]] of the term ''Shqiptar'' by some Western European authors in use from the late 18th century to the early 20th century.&lt;ref name="BardhylDemiraj534535"&gt;{{harvnb|Demiraj|2010|pp=534–535}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''Šiptar'' (Шиптар),  plural: ''Šiptari'' (Шиптари) and also ''Šiftari'' (Шифтари) is a derivation used by Balkan Slavic peoples and former states like [[Yugoslavia]] which Albanians consider derogatory due to its negative connotations preferring ''Albanci'' instead.&lt;ref name="Murati71"&gt;{{harvnb|Murati|1991|p=71}}.

"There is similar terminological confusion over the name for the inhabitants of the region. After 1945, in pursuit of a policy of national equality, the Communist Party designated the Albanian community as ‘Šiptari’ (Shqiptare, in Albanian), the term used by Albanians themselves to mark the ethnic identity of any member of the Albanian nation, whether living in Albania or elsewhere.… However, with the increased territorial autonomy of Kosovo in the late 1960s, the Albanian leadership requested that the term ‘Albanians’ be used instead—thus stressing national, rather than ethnic, self-identification of the Kosovar population. The term ‘Albanians’ was accepted and included in the 1974 Yugoslav Constitution. In the process, however, the Serbian version of the Albanian term for ethnic Albanians—‘Šiptari’—had acquired an openly pejorative flavor, implying cultural and racial inferiority. Nowadays, even though in the documents of post- socialist Serbia the term ‘Albanians’ is accepted as official, many state and opposition party leaders use the term ‘Šiptari’ indiscriminately in an effort to relegate the Kosovo Albanians to the status of one among many minority groups in Serbia. Thus the quarrel over the terms used to identify the region and its inhabitants has acquired a powerful emotional and political significance for both communities.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Neofotistos288"&gt;{{harvnb|Neofotistos|2010a|pp=288}}. "Because of their allegedly rampant aggression and concerted attempts to destroy national integrity, Albanians in Macedonia are stigmatized with the pejorative term ''Šiptar'' (singular)/''Šiptari'' (plural) as an ethic Other. Especially important for the purposes of this paper, as I show below, is the ambivalent character of the stereotype ''Šiptar/i''—after all, as Bhabha ([1994] 2004:95) reminds us "the stereotype [is] an ambivalent mode of knowledge and power," a "contradictory mode of representation, as anxious as it is assertive" (2004:100). In particular, the stereotype declares Albanians to be utterly incapable of participating in political and social life as Macedonian nationals who are committed to respecting and upholding state laws, and the territorial integrity and national sovereignty of Macedonia. In this sense, they are allegedly intrinsically "inferior"—"stupid," "dirty," "smelly," "uncultured," "backward," and so on. By the same token, however, and in the context of an ethnic-chauvinist and masculinist ideology (which I discuss in the next section), the stereotype also declares Albanians to be aggressive and capable of violating the territorial integrity of the Macedonian state and the moral integrity of Macedonian women. In this sense then, the stereotype invests Albanians with an excessive, disorderly energy that cannot be regulated and, hence, is dangerous (also see Lambevski 1997; for an analysis of the production and transgression of stereotypes, see Neofotistos 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Neofotistos884891"&gt;{{harvnb|Neofotistos|2010b|pp=884–891}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

He attended Sudbury Primary School in Perrin Road&lt;ref name="book"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dawson|first=Julian|title=And On Piano...Nicky Hopkins|publisher=Desert Hearts|year=2011|page=25|isbn=978-1-898948-12-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Wembley County Grammar School,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kilburntimes.co.uk/what-s-on/homage_to_wembley_session_musician_who_played_with_the_beatles_1_911740 |title=Homage to Wembley session musician who played with The Beatles. – What's on – Brent &amp; Kilburn Times |website=Kilburntimes.co.uk |date=3 June 2011 |accessdate=2014-07-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508124052/http://www.kilburntimes.co.uk/what-s-on/homage_to_wembley_session_musician_who_played_with_the_beatles_1_911740 |archivedate=8 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which now forms part of [[Alperton Community School]], and was initially tutored by a local piano teacher; in his teens he won a scholarship to the [[Royal Academy of Music]] in London.&lt;ref name="nickyhopkins.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nickyhopkins.com/?page_id=5|title=Nicky Hopkins - Biography|website=Nickyhopkins.com|accessdate=30 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He suffered from [[Crohn's disease]] for most of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rocks Off: 50 Tracks That Tell the Story of the Rolling Stones|first=Bill|last=Janovitz|p=326|year=2014|isbn=978-0-857-90790-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His poor health and repeated surgery later made it difficult for him to tour, and he worked mainly as a [[session musician]] for most of his career.&lt;Ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GgkEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA21&amp;dq=%22nicky+hopkins%22+session+musician&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwir3MH59sTdAhVeFMAKHRkzAKIQ6AEITTAG#v=onepage&amp;q=%22nicky%20hopkins%22%20session%20musician&amp;f=false|title=Hopkins Forsakes Studios For Solo|work=Billboard|date=16 June 1973|p=21|accessdate=18 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early groups and as a session musician==
Hopkins' studies were interrupted in 1960 when he left school at 16 to become the pianist with [[Screaming Lord Sutch]]'s [[Screaming Lord Sutch and the Savages|Savages]] until, two years later, he and fellow Savages Bernie Watson, Rick Brown (aka [[Ricky Fenson]]) and [[Carlo Little]], joined the renowned blues harmonica player [[Cyril Davies]], who had just left [[Blues Incorporated]], and became the [[All-Stars (band)|Cyril Davies (R&amp;B) All-Stars]].&lt;ref name="nickyhopkins.com"/&gt; Hopkins played piano on their first single, Davies' much-admired theme tune "Country Line Special".&lt;ref name="guide1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bodganov|first=Vladimir|title=All Music Guide to the Blues|publisher=Backbeat Books|year=2003|edition=3rd|page=140|isbn=0-87930-736-6|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; However he was forced to leave the All Stars in May 1963 for a series of operations that almost cost him his life and was bed-ridden for nineteen months in his late teenage years. During his convalescence Davies died of [[Leukemia|leukaemia]] and the All Stars disbanded.&lt;ref name="nickyhopkins.com"/&gt;

Hopkins' frail health led him to concentrate on working as a [[session musician]] instead of joining bands, although he left his mark performing with a wide variety of famous bands.&lt;ref name=RayDavies /&gt; He quickly became one of London's most in-demand session pianists and performed on many hit recordings from this period. He worked extensively for leading UK independent producers [[Shel Talmy]] and [[Andrew Loog Oldham]] and performed on albums and singles by [[the Easybeats]],&lt;ref name=Milesago&gt;{{cite web|title=MILESAGO – The Easybeats|url=http://www.milesago.com/Artists/easybeats.htm|accessdate=20 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[the Kinks]], the [[Pretty Things]], [[the Move]], [[the Rolling Stones]] and [[the Who]].

In 1967, he joined [[The Jeff Beck Group]]. Intended as a vehicle for former [[Yardbirds]] guitarist [[Jeff Beck]], the band also included vocalist [[Rod Stewart]], bassist [[Ronnie Wood]] and drummer [[Micky Waller]].&lt;ref&gt;Hoffmann, Frank W. (ed.) (rev. 2005). ''Encyclopedia of Recorded Sound'', p. 83. CRC Press. {{ISBN|0-415-93835-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; He remained with the ensemble through its dissolution in August 1969, performing on ''[[Truth (Jeff Beck album)|Truth]]'' (1968) and ''[[Beck-Ola]]'' (1969).

[[File:Quicksilver Messenger Service 1970.JPG|thumb|right|190px|[[Quicksilver Messenger Service]] in January 1970, with Hopkins second from right]]
The following year, Hopkins recorded ''[[Beggars Banquet]]'' with [[The Rolling Stones]], having previously worked for them on their 1967 single "[[We Love You]]" and the album ''[[Their Satanic Majesties Request]]''. He also began to record for several [[San Francisco|San Franciscan]] groups, playing on albums by [[Jefferson Airplane]] (with whom he also performed in a one-off appearance at their [[Woodstock]] Festival concert in August 1969 following the unanticipated breakup of The Jeff Beck Group), the [[New Riders of the Purple Sage]] and the [[Steve Miller Band]].

From 1969 to 1970, Hopkins was a full member of [[Quicksilver Messenger Service]], appearing on ''[[Shady Grove (Quicksilver Messenger Service album)|Shady Grove]]'' (1969), ''[[Just for Love]]'' (1970) and ''[[What About Me (Quicksilver Messenger Service album)|What About Me]]'' (1970). In 1975, he contributed to the ''[[Solid Silver]]'' reunion album as a session musician.

By this point Hopkins was one of Britain's best-known session players, particularly through his work with the Rolling Stones and after playing electric piano on [[The Beatles]]' "[[Revolution (Beatles song)|Revolution]]" – a rare occasion when an outside rock musician appeared on a Beatles recording. Further raising his profile, he contributed to several [[Harry Nilsson]] albums in the early 1970s, including ''[[Nilsson Schmilsson]]'' and ''[[Son of Schmilsson]]'', and recordings by [[Donovan]].

==With The Rolling Stones==
Hopkins played with the Rolling Stones on their studio albums from ''[[Between the Buttons]]'' in 1967 through ''[[Tattoo You]]'' in 1981. Among his contributions, he supplied the prominent piano parts on "[[We Love You]]" and "[[She's a Rainbow]]" (both 1967), "[[Sympathy for the Devil]]" (1968), "[[Monkey Man (The Rolling Stones song)|Monkey Man]]" (1969), "[[Sway (The Rolling Stones song)|Sway]]" (1971), "[[Loving Cup (song)|Loving Cup]]" and "[[Ventilator Blues]]" (1972), "[[Angie (song)|Angie]]" (1973), "[[Time Waits for No One (song)|Time Waits for No One]]" (1974) and "[[Waiting on a Friend]]" (1981). When working with the band during their critical and commercial zenith in the late 1960s and early 1970s, Hopkins tended to be employed on a wide range of slower ballads, uptempo rockers and acoustic material; conversely, longtime ''de facto'' Stones keyboardist [[Ian Stewart (musician)|Ian Stewart]] only played on traditional [[major key]] [[blues rock]] numbers of his choice, while [[Billy Preston]] often featured on soul- and funk-influenced tunes. Hopkins' work with the Rolling Stones is perhaps most prominent on their 1972 studio album, ''[[Exile on Main St.]]'', where he contributed in a variety of musical styles.

Along with [[Ry Cooder]], [[Mick Jagger]], [[Bill Wyman]] and [[Charlie Watts]], Hopkins released the 1972 album ''[[Jamming with Edward!]]'' It was recorded in 1969, during the Stones' ''[[Let It Bleed]]'' sessions, when guitarist [[Keith Richards]] was not present in the studio. The eponymous "Edward" was an [[Pseudonym|alias]] of Nicky Hopkins derived from studio banter with [[Brian Jones]]. It was incorporated into the title of an outstanding Hopkins instrumental performance ("Edward, the Mad Shirt Grinder") released on ''Shady Grove'' in December 1969. Hopkins also contributed to the ''Jamming With Edward!'' cover art.

Hopkins was added to the Rolling Stones touring line-up for the [[The Rolling Stones UK Tour 1971|1971 Good-Bye Britain Tour]], as well as the notorious [[The Rolling Stones American Tour 1972|1972 North American tour]] and the [[The Rolling Stones Pacific Tour 1973|1973 Pacific tour]]. He contemplated forming his own band with multi-instrumentalist [[Pete Sears]] and drummer [[Prairie Prince]] around this time but decided against it after the Stones tour. Hopkins failed to make the Rolling Stones' [[The Rolling Stones 1973 European Tour|1973 European tour]] due to ill health and, aside from a guest appearance in 1978, did not play again with the Stones live on stage.

==With The Kinks==
Hopkins was invited in 1965 by producer Shel Talmy to record with [[The Kinks]]. He recorded 4 studio albums: ''[[The Kink Kontroversy]]'' (1965), ''[[Face to Face (The Kinks album)|Face to Face]]'' (1966), ''[[Something Else by The Kinks]]'' (1967) and ''[[The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society]]'' (1968).

The relationship between Hopkins and the Kinks deteriorated after the release of ''The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society'', however. Hopkins maintained that "about seventy percent" of the keyboard work on the album was his, and was incensed when [[Ray Davies]] apparently credited himself for the majority of the keyboard playing.&lt;ref&gt;Dawson, Julian (2011). ''And on Piano … Nicky Hopkins''. Backstage Press. pp. 82–83&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Hopkins' ensuing grudge against him, Davies spoke positively of his contributions in a ''[[New York Times]]'' interview in 1995:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Nicky, unlike lesser musicians, didn't try to show off; he would only play when necessary. But he had the ability to turn an ordinary track into a gem – slotting in the right chord at the right time or dropping a set of triplets around the back beat, just enough to make you want to dance. On a ballad, he could sense which notes to wrap around the song without being obtrusive. He managed to give "Days," for instance, a mysterious religious quality without being sentimental or pious.

Nicky and I were hardly bosom buddies. We socialized only on coffee breaks and in between takes. In many ways, I was still in awe of the man who in 1963 had played with the Cyril Davies All Stars on the classic British R &amp; B record, "Country Line Special." I was surprised to learn that Nicky came from Wembley, just outside of London. With his style, he should have been from New Orleans, or Memphis.

… His best work in his short spell with the Kinks was on the album ''Face to Face.'' I had written a song called "Session Man," inspired partly by Nicky. Shel Talmy asked Nicky to throw in "something classy" at the beginning of the track. Nicky responded by playing a classical- style harpsichord part. When we recorded "Sunny Afternoon," Shel insisted that Nicky copy my plodding piano style. Other musicians would have been insulted but Nicky seemed to get inside my style, and he played exactly as I would have. No ego. Perhaps that was his secret.&lt;ref name=RayDavies&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kindakinks.net/misc/articles/19950101-hopkins-nyt.html |title=Ray Davies on Nicky Hopkins, from ''The New York Times'', on January 1, 1995 |website=Kindakinks.net |date=1 January 1995 |accessdate=2014-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Other groups and solo albums==
In 1969, Hopkins was a member of the short-lived [[Sweet Thursday (band)|Sweet Thursday]], a quintet comprising Hopkins, [[Alun Davies (guitarist)|Alun Davies]] ([[Cat Stevens]]), [[Jon Mark]], Harvey Burns and Brian Odgers. The band completed their [[Sweet Thursday (album)|eponymous debut album]]; however, the project was doomed from the start. Their American record label, [[Tetragrammaton Records]], abruptly declared bankruptcy&lt;ref name="bsnp"&gt;|{{cite web | url=http://bsnpubs.com/la/tetragrammaton/tetragrammaton.html | title=Tetragrammaton Album Discography | author1=Callahan, Mike | author2=Eyries, Patrice | author3=Edwards, Dave | last-author-amp=yes | publisher=Both Sides Now Publications | date=25 March 2008 | accessdate=3 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r5328|pure_url=yes}} | title=Deep Purple &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;1969&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;: Review | author=Eder, Bruce | publisher=[[AllMusic]] | accessdate=3 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; (by legend, the same day the album was released)&lt;ref name="rs-encl"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock &amp; Roll | editor-first=Holly | editor-last=George-Warren | editor2-first=Patricia | editor2-last=Romanowski | editor3-first=Jon | editor3-last=Pareles | edition=3rd | publisher=[[Fireside Books]] | year=2001 | isbn=0-7432-0120-5 | page=608}}&lt;/ref&gt; with promotion and a possible tour never happening.

He released his second solo album (''[[The Tin Man Was a Dreamer]]'') in 1973 under the aegis of producer [[David Briggs (record producer)|David Briggs]], best known for his work with [[Neil Young]] and [[Spirit (band)|Spirit]]. Other musicians appearing on the album include [[George Harrison]] (credited as "George O'Hara"), [[Mick Taylor]] of the Rolling Stones and Prairie Prince. Re-released by Columbia in 2004, the album features rare Hopkins vocal performances.

In August 1975, he joined the [[Jerry Garcia Band]], envisaged as a major creative vehicle for the guitarist during the mid-seventies hiatus of the [[Grateful Dead]]. His increasing use of alcohol precipitated several erratic live performances, resulting in him leaving the group by mutual agreement after a December 31 appearance.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Blair (2000). ''Garcia: An American Life'', pp. 269–70. Penguin. {{ISBN|0-14-029199-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

His third solo album, entitled ''No More Changes'', was also released in 1975. Appearing on the album are Hopkins (lead vocals and all keyboards), David Tedstone (guitars), Michael Kennedy (guitars), Rick Wills (bass), and Eric Dillon (drums and percussion), with back-up vocals from Kathi McDonald, Lea Santo-Robertie, [[Doug Duffey]] and Dolly. A fourth album, ''Long Journey Home'', has remained unreleased. He also released three [[soundtrack|soundtrack albums]] in Japan between 1992 and 1993, ''The Fugitive'', ''Patio'' and ''Namiki Family''.

During 1979-1989, he was playing and touring with Los Angeles-based [[Night (rock band)|Night]], who had a hit with a cover of [[Walter Egan]]'s "Hot Summer Nights".

Hopkins, given his long association with [[The Who]], was a key instrumentalist on the soundtrack for the 1975 [[Ken Russell]] film, ''[[Tommy (1975 film)|Tommy]]''. Hopkins played piano on most of the tracks, and is acknowledged in the album's liner notes for his work on the arrangements for most of the songs.

In addition to recording with the Beatles in 1968, Hopkins worked with each of the four when they went solo. Between 1970 and 1975, he appeared on many projects by [[John Lennon]], [[George Harrison]] and [[Ringo Starr]], making key contributions to the critically acclaimed solo albums ''[[Imagine (John Lennon album)|Imagine]]'', ''[[Living in the Material World]]'' and ''[[Ringo (album)|Ringo]]''. He worked only once with [[Paul McCartney]], on the latter's 1989 album ''[[Flowers in the Dirt]]''.

==Later life==
Hopkins lived in [[Mill Valley, California]], for several years. During this time he worked with several local bands and continued to record in San Francisco.  One of his complaints throughout his career was that he did not receive [[royalties]] from any of his recording sessions, because of his status at the time as merely a "hired hand", as opposed to [[Celebrity|pop star]]s with agents. He received songwriting credit for his work with the Jeff Beck Group, including an instrumental, "Girl From Mill Valley", on the 1969 album ''[[Beck-Ola]]''. Only Quicksilver Messenger Service, through its manager Ron Polte and its members, gave Hopkins an ownership stake.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} Towards the end of his life he worked as a composer and orchestrator of [[film score]]s, with considerable success in Japan.

In the early 1980s, Hopkins credited the [[Church of Scientology]]-affiliated [[Narconon]] rehabilitation program with vanquishing his drug and alcohol addictions; he ultimately remained a [[Scientologist]] for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nodepression.com/article/book-review-and-pianonicky-hopkins-life-rocks-greatest-session-man|title=Book Review: and on the piano..Nicky Hopkins-The Life of Rock's Greatest Session Man|date=30 September 2011|website=Nodepression.com|accessdate=30 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of his religious affiliation, he contributed to several of [[L. Ron Hubbard]]'s musical recordings.

==Death==
Hopkins died on 6 September 1994, at the age of 50, in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], from complications resulting from intestinal surgery related to his lifelong battle with [[Crohn's disease]]. At the time of his death, he was working on his autobiography with [[Ray Coleman]]. He is survived by his wife, Moira.&lt;ref name="NYTimesObituary"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Strauss |first1=Neil |title=Nicky Hopkins, 50, Studio Keyboardist In Rock Recording |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/10/obituaries/nicky-hopkins-50-studio-keyboardist-in-rock-recording.html |accessdate=13 June 2018 |work=The New York Times |date=10 September 1994 |page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Songwriter and musician [[Julian Dawson]] collaborated with Hopkins on one recording, the pianist's last, in spring 1994, a few months before his death. After Ray Coleman's death, the connection led to Dawson working on a definitive biography of Hopkins, first published by [[Random House]] in German in 2010, followed in 2011 by the English-language version with the title ''And on Piano … Nicky Hopkins'' (a hardback in the UK via Desert Hearts, and a paperback in North America via Backstage Books/Plus One Press).

On 8 September 2018, the Nicky Hopkins "piano" park bench memorial, crowdfunded through [[PledgeMusic]], was unveiled in [[Perivale]] Park near Hopkins' birthplace.&lt;ref name="EalingNewsExtra"&gt;{{cite news |title=Musical memorial unveiled for keyboard star Nicky Hopkins |url=http://ealingnewsextra.co.uk/latest-news/nickyhopkins/ |accessdate=15 September 2018 |work=Ealing News Extra |date=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign offered the opportunity for pledgers to have their name inscribed on the bench and contribute towards funding a music scholarship at London’s [[Royal Academy of Music]], where Hopkins himself won a scholarship in the 1950s. Names that have pledged in the campaign include [[Mick Jagger]], [[Keith Richards]], [[Charlie Watts]], [[Ronnie Wood]], [[Bill Wyman]], [[Yoko Ono Lennon]], [[Roger Daltrey]], [[Jimmy Page]], [[Johnnie Walker_(DJ)|Johnnie Walker]] and [[Kenney Jones]].

'''Ovonramwen Nogbaisi''' (ruled 1888 – 1897), also called '''Overami''', was the  [[Oba (ruler)|Ọba]] (king) of the [[Kingdom of Benin]] up until the British punitive expedition of 1897.

Born in circa 1857, he was the son of Ọba [[Adọlọ]], he took the name Ovọnramwẹn Nọgbaisi at his enthronement in 1888, every Ọba took a new name at his coronation, the name translates as Ovọnramwẹn meaning "The Rising Sun" and Nọgbaisi meaning "which spreads over all".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3Hw_tF0dGt8C&amp;pg=PA113&amp;dq=%22Ovonramwen%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjiiJSVo9fSAhVkLMAKHZLuCcAQ6AEIJDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Ovonramwen%22&amp;f=false|title=Dawn to Dusk: Folk Tales from Benin|last=Eweka|first=Iro|date=|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=1998|isbn=9780714643625|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edostate.org/oba.php Oba of Benin] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407211600/http://www.edostate.org/oba.php |date=2012-04-07 }}, Edostate.org, accessed March, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the 19th century, the Kingdom of Benin had managed to retain its independence and the Ọba exercised a monopoly over trade which the British found irksome. The territory was coveted by an influential group of investors for its rich natural resources such as palm-oil, rubber and ivory.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Uwadiale Obinyan, The Annexation of Benin, in Journal of Black Studies, Vol. 19, No. 1 (Sep., 1988), pp. 29-40&lt;/ref&gt; The kingdom was largely independent of British control, and pressure continued from figures such as Vice-Consul [[James Robert Phillips]] and Captain Gallwey (the British vice-Consul of [[Niger Coast Protectorate|Oil Rivers Protectorate]]) who were pushing for British annexation of the Benin Empire and the removal of the Ọba.

A British invasion force headed by Phillips set out to overthrow the Ọba in 1896. The force's weapons were hidden in baggage, with troops disguised as bearers. Phillips plan was to gain access to Ovonramwen's palace by announcing that he intended to negotiate. Ovonramwen's messengers issued several warnings not to violate Benin territorial sovereignty, claiming he was unable to see Phillips due to ceremonial duties. Having been warned on several further occasions on the way, Phillips sent his stick to the Ọba, a deliberate insult designed to provoke the conflict that would provide an excuse for British annexation.&lt;ref&gt;Sven Lindqvist, Exterminate All the Brutes, p.57-62&lt;/ref&gt; Phillip's expedition was ambushed and all but two were killed. Subsequently a [[Benin Expedition of 1897|military operation against Benin]] in 1897 led by [[Harry Rawson]] resulted in the burning of Benin City, the destruction and [[Benin Bronzes|looting of the royal palaces]], and the deaths of untold numbers of its inhabitants. Although the British had orders to hang the Ọba, Ovonramwen escaped, but returned to the city to formally surrender on  5 August 1897. When Ovọnramwẹn returned to the city, after six months spent in evading capture in the forest, he was richly dressed and laden with coral beads and accompanied by an entourage of seven hundred to eight hundred people. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He attempted to escape exile by offering Consul General Ralph Moor 200 puncheons (barrels) of oil worth £1500 [£183000.00 today] and to disclose where his 500 ivory tusks were buried [today's value: Up to £275,625,500.00] however this offer was dismissed as Mr. Moor had already discovered them.&lt;ref&gt;Roth H. L. Great Benin Its Customs, Art and Horrors, 1903, appendix 111 pp xvii. &lt;/ref&gt;

Ovonramwen was exiled to [[Calabar]] with two of his wives, Queen Egbe and Queen Aighobahi, and died there around the turn of the new year in 1914.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=MM8lDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA117&amp;dq=%22Ovonramwen%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjiiJSVo9fSAhVkLMAKHZLuCcAQ6AEIQjAH#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Ovonramwen%22&amp;f=false|title=Servants of the Dynasty: Palace Women in World History|last=Walthall|first=Anne|date=|publisher=University of California Press|year=2008|isbn=9780520254435|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ovọnramwẹn was eventually buried in the grounds of the royal palace in Benin City. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qK5bre18YkQC&amp;q=Ov%E1%BB%8Dnramw%E1%BA%B9n+buried#v=twopage&amp;q=Ovonramwen%20buried&amp;f=false|title=Beyond Primitivism: Indigenous Religious Traditions and Modernity|last=Kaplan|first=Flora Edouwaye S.|date=|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2004|isbn=9780415273190|editor-last=Olupona|editor-first=Jacob Kẹhinde|location=|pages=|language=en|chapter=Sacrifice and sanctity in Benin}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was succeeded by his first son and legitimate heir, Prince Aguobasimwin, who ruled as [[Eweka II]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=MM8lDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA117&amp;dq=eweka+Aguobasimwin&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiE6ZjNwNfSAhUEI8AKHasfDeEQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=eweka%20Aguobasimwin&amp;f=false|title=Servants of the Dynasty: Palace Women in World History|last=Kaplan|first=Flora Edouwaye S.|date=2008-06-10|publisher=University of California Press|year=|isbn=9780520254435|editor-last=Walthall|editor-first=Anne|location=|pages=|language=en|chapter=Politics in an African Royal Harem: Women and Seculsion at the Royal Court of Benin Nigeria}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stanley Patrick Evelyn Simon''' (14 March 1920 – 22 May 2008), known as '''Pat Simon''', was a veteran [[England|English]] [[Master of Wine]], wine-merchant and writer on [[wine]].

==Career==
After six years at [[Gresham's School]], [[Holt, Norfolk|Holt]] (1931–1937), and military service during the [[Second World War]], Simon entered the wine trade in 1948, importing wines chiefly from [[France]],  [[Germany]], [[Italy]], and [[Portugal]], but later also from [[Spain]], [[South Africa]], [[Australia]] and the [[United States]]. Going into business on his own account as an importer and wholesaler of wines (trading as Pat Simon Wines Ltd), by 1969 he rose to the rank of [[Master of Wine]] of the [[Institute of Masters of Wine]] and also became a frequent contributor to specialist periodicals.

Simon's book ''Wine-tasters' Logic'' (2000) distils the experiences of fifty years of [[wine-tasting]] and is also full of anecdotes of the wine trade of long ago. The first part of the book discusses the concepts behind wine-tasting, exploring areas like [[aroma]], balance, finish, and [[tannins (wine)|tannin]]. The second part contains details on, choice of [[glass]]es and instructions for [[decantation|decanting]] wine correctly.

He has denied these accusations.&lt;ref name=Lib&gt;''«La révolution était une obligation religieuse»'', interview with Rachid Ramda published in ''[[Libération]]'' on 1 Octoberst, 2007 [http://www.liberation.fr/actualite/societe/281773.FR.php read here] {{fr icon}} &lt;!-- please do not change references format, this link is subjected to link rot --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Algeria==
Rachid Ramda was born in [[El Ogla, Tébessa|El Ogla]] on 29 September 1969, in the East of Algeria. He is from a [[Berber people|Berber]] [[Chaoui people|Chaouia]] family, although [[Arabic]] is his native language.&lt;ref name=Lib/&gt; All the members of his family are well educated:  one of his brothers is an architect-engineer, another a computer scientist.&lt;ref name=Lib/&gt; Ramda studied architecture at the Institut Polytechnique.&lt;ref name=Lib/&gt; He became a supporter of the [[Islamic Salvation Front]] (FIS) when it was founded in 1988; his literature teacher was a co-founder of the FIS.&lt;ref name=Lib/&gt; According to his own statements, he left Algeria in 1989 for [[Pakistan]], thus before the cancellation of the elections which set the stage for the [[Algerian Civil War]], and before the formation of the [[Armed Islamic Group]] (GIA).&lt;ref name=Lib/&gt; In Pakistan he entered into contact with Muslim humanitarian NGOs and other NGOs (including [[Doctors Without Borders]]) assisting [[Afghan refugees]].&lt;ref name=Lib/&gt; He then abandoned his architectural training.&lt;ref name=Lib/&gt; He went to London, where he wrote articles for the ''[[El Ansar]]'' newspaper.&lt;ref name=Lib/&gt; Ramda has denied the allegations of French justice that ''El Ansar'' was the official mouthpiece of the GIA.&lt;ref name=Lib/&gt;

In 1993, Ramda was sentenced to the [[death penalty|death]] in [[Algeria]] ''[[trial in absentia|in absentia]]'' for a terrorist attack at the airport of [[Algiers]], which had killed 9 and wounded 123. {{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

==Extradition==
Ramda was granted [[refugee]] status in the [[United Kingdom]]{{When|date=June 2013}}. After the [[1995 bombings in France|1995 terror bombings in Paris]], he was arrested in London on 4 November 1995, accused by French prosecutors of having funded the bombings and of being their mastermind.&lt;ref name=Lib/&gt; Ramda has denied the funding role, citing a report from the [[Scotland Yard]] inspector John MacMillan of 23 November 1995, which stated that "no bank accounts have been identified which could be associated with Ramda, or the other possible names used."&lt;ref name=Lib/&gt; He did, however, admit that his [[fingerprint]]s had been found on a [[Western Union]] [[money order]] of 38,000 [[French francs|Francs]] sent to the bomber [[Ait Ali Belkacem]]. Ramda claimed that he did not know Ait Ali Belkacem; he has also denied knowing the other bomber, [[Boualem Bensaid]].&lt;ref name=Lib/&gt; Ramda was detained in the HSSU high security unit of [[Belmarsh prison]], which he has compared to [[Guantanamo Base|Guantanamo]].&lt;ref name=Lib/&gt;

France requested the [[extradition]] of Ramda from the United Kingdom; Ramda successfully fought extradition until 2005. The refusal of British authorities to extradite Ramda was a point of contention between France and the UK, with many in France and elsewhere alleging that the British government was deliberately lenient to Islamist terrorists operating outside of the UK in order to buy peace in the UK (the alleged "[[Londonistan]]" policy). In fact, British ministers repeatedly tried to extradite Ramda, but had their decisions overturned by the [[High Court of Justice|British High Court]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=The Non-trial  | date=20 October 2005  | publisher=[[The Economist]] | url=http://www.economist.com/displayStory.cfm?Story_ID=5064980}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=The extradition of Ramda examined on 14 October | date=26 September 2005 | publisher=[[Le Nouvel Observateur]] | url=http://permanent.nouvelobs.com/europe/20050926.OBS0255.html | language=fr }}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[July 2005 London bombings]] changed sentiment and paved the way for Ramda's extradition in December 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/26/AR2007102601425.html French court convicts Algerian of Paris bombings] Washington Post, 26 October 2007 &lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters{{Who|date=June 2009}} of Ramda characterise him as an [[right of asylum|asylum]] seeker held for ten years in UK prisons without charge or trial and claim that this is a clear miscarriage of justice.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} Detractors{{Who|date=June 2009}} note that in the legal sense, Ramda's stay in various UK prisons was not just entirely voluntary{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}, but costly to the British taxpayer. Despite never paying a penny in tax, he was given access to free legal aid for 10 years, whereas he could at any point give up fighting extradition and stand trial in France {{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}. Ramda states that he had been fighting extradition because of his fears of mistreatment of Muslims in the French justice system.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

==Trial in France==
After exhausting all his appeals, Ramda was handed over to French custody on 1 December 2005. Transferred to the ''[[Palais de Justice, Paris|Palais de Justice]]'' of Paris, he was formally informed of four indictments laid against him by the French justice: one for criminal association with a terrorist organisation (specifically for providing funding to the [[Algerian Armed Islamic Group]], or GIA), and three in relation to three terrorist attacks in Paris in 1995. The former, being a "délit", i.e. a crime of intermediate seriousness, would be tried in the [[Tribunal Correctionnel]]; and the latter three, considered felonies (that is, carrying a possible sentence of more than 10 years) in the [[Cour d'assises]].

On 29 March 2006 Ramda was convicted of criminal association with a terrorist organisation and sentenced to ten years in prison by the Tribunal Correctionel, the maximum possible sentence. He had refused to co-operate in his own defense. This sentence was confirmed by the [[Appeal Court]] in December 2006.&lt;ref name=Monde&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0@2-3224,36-961364@51-961361,0.html Dans "Libération", Rachid Ramda nie les accusations portées contre lui], ''[[Le Monde]]'', 1 Octoberst, 2007 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ramda has been accused{{Who|date=June 2009}} of being one of the masterminds of the Algerian radical Islamist movement, and one of the main personalities of the Algerian [[Armed Islamic Group]] (GIA). Others{{Who|date=June 2009}} point out that his young age at the time of his arrest (25) and possible links with other, more senior, Islamic fundamentalists as indicatie that he is only a low level functionary.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} Ramda has rejected these accusations in an October 2007 interview in ''[[Libération]].''&lt;ref name=Lib/&gt;

The prosecution has showed his fingerprints were on a Western Union money order of 38,000 Francs sent to the bomber Ait Ali Belkacem. Ramda claims that he did not know Belkacem, although he admits that it was his fingerprints on the money order. He claims that the prosecution has given a false interpretation of this [[evidence]].&lt;ref name=Lib/&gt; Further evidence submitted by the prosecution concerns [[wiretaps]] of phone communications between Ramda and the bombers in France, a short time before and after the bombings.

==Struggle for human rights==
In the 1970s, Radhia Nasraoui started campaigning for human rights, when the regime of President [[Habib Bourguiba|Bourguiba]] banned demonstrations by students and workers. In 1976, she managed to convince her employing firm to defend students who are accused.

Appointed president, she denounced what she sees as the "systematic [[torture]]" practiced in his country since the accession to power of President [[Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali|Ben Ali]] 7 November 1987.
Due to her professional activities in favor of human rights in Tunisia, Radhia Nasraoui continued to be exposed to repression and police brutality. The [[United Nations|U.N.]] [[Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women]] reported:
{{quote|On 12 February 1998, the Office of Radhia Nasraoui was ransacked and most of her records stolen [...] Her house is under constant surveillance, her phone line is cut or regularly tapped. In addition, her daughters endure constant bullying. 8 May 2001, while returning from Paris, she was intercepted at the airport of Tunis and all documents (including articles on the repression in Tunisia) were confiscated. In August, her car was vandalized. Harassment of her and her daughters has increased since the beginning of January 2002.}}
From 15 October to 10 December 2003, she went on [[hunger strike]] "to protest against government agents' burglarizing of her office and terrorizing her family and to demand that justice should be done after a physical assault suffered in July" she put an end to the strike on the day of the commemoration of the 55th anniversary of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].

Radhia Nasraoui continues to be exposed to state repression until the revolution of 2011 marked the fall of President Ben Ali. During this period, she was considered as a lawyer and activist against [[Torture]] and one of Tunisia's most renowned opinion leaders of the Arab Spring.

==Early life==
Corddry was born and raised in [[Weymouth, Massachusetts]]. He is the son of Robin (née Sullivan) and Steven Corddry, who was a [[Massachusetts Port Authority]] official.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/magazine/articles/2005/05/01/a_bald_liar/ | work=The Boston Globe | first=Paul | last=Rogers | title=A Bald Liar | date=May 1, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umassmag.com/Fall_2005/Class_Clown_940.html UMass Magazine Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120528062958/http://www.umassmag.com/Fall_2005/Class_Clown_940.html |date=May 28, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the older brother of actor [[Nate Corddry]]. He has a younger sister, Laura Corddry, who is an administrator at [[Southern New Hampshire University]]. Corddry and his brother are both [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scouts]] from Troop 19, located in Weymouth.&lt;ref name="cordddryeagle"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/mar/25/entertainment/la-et-performance25-2010mar25|title=The Performance: Rob Corddry|last=Ordoña|first=Michael|date=March 25, 2010|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=2010-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="corddreagle2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gothamist.com/2010/03/25/rob_cordry_actor.php|title=Rob Corddry, Hot Tub Time Machine|last=Del Signore|first=John|date=March 25, 2010|publisher=Gothamist|accessdate=2010-08-15|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100709051231/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/25/rob_cordry_actor.php|archivedate=July 9, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating from Weymouth North High School (1989), Corddry went to the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]] (1989–93). According to an interview in the UMass Amherst [[alumnus|alumni]] magazine, Corddry initially planned to major in journalism, but he stuck with it for just two days. English became his official major. By his second year, he focused much of his attention on Drama classes and plays including ''[[Torch Song Trilogy]]'', ''[[And Then There Were None|Ten Little Indians]]'', ''[[Cat on a Hot Tin Roof]]'', ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', and ''[[Reckless (play)|Reckless]]''. While at UMass, Corddry pledged the Theta Chapter of [[Theta Chi]] fraternity.

In January 1994, Corddry moved to New York City. His early paying jobs included working as a security guard at [[The Metropolitan Museum of Art]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | title = Anytime with Bob Kushell feat. Rob Corddry | series = [[Anytime with Bob Kushell]] | airdate = 2009-02-12 | season = 1 | number = 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and handing out menus for a [[Mexican cuisine|Mexican]] restaurant. He eventually landed acting jobs, including a year-long tour with the [[National Shakespeare Conservatory|National Shakespeare Company]]. He trained in [[Improvisational theatre|improv]] at the [[Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre]] in New York City, performing regularly as a member of the [[sketch comedy]] group "The Naked Babies" (with [[John Ross Bowie]], [[Brian Huskey]], and [[Seth Morris]]); and he spent two years with the sketch comedy group "Third Rail Comedy". Corddry's first notable television appearances were on [[Comedy Central]]'s ''[[Upright Citizens Brigade]]'' (1998–2000).

==''The Daily Show''==
In Spring 2002, he accepted an audition for ''[[The Daily Show]]''. His pieces for ''The Daily Show'' frequently included references to [[Boston, Massachusetts]], which he considers to be his hometown. On October 4, 2005, his younger brother [[Nate Corddry]] made his first appearance as a ''Daily Show'' [[journalist|correspondent]]. On January 12, 2006, Corddry's wife Sandra appeared with him on a ''Daily Show'' segment; they welcomed their first child, daughter Sloane Sullivan Corddry, on July 3, 2006. On February 9, 2006 Corddry hosted an episode of ''The Daily Show'' due to the absence of [[Jon Stewart]] (jokingly because the show's regular host was "[[Plastic surgery|in the shop]]", but in fact because of the birth of Stewart's second child).{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

On August 15, 2006, Corddry said "I've got like a week and a half left, all bets are off", and then on August 21, 2006, Stewart remarked that Corddry's last day on ''The Daily Show'' would be August 24, 2006. Corddry appeared throughout the week, once filing a report from inside a toilet bowl supposedly on board an aircraft transporting [[John Mark Karr]], and another dressed up in a [[1970s in fashion|1970s fashion]]; Stewart remarked, "It's his last week, and really, we're trying to come up with terrible things for him to have to do."

During that last show on August 24, Corddry aired a self-produced [[tribute]] to his four years on the show, going out, as Stewart said, with a "[[Toilet humour|poop joke]]".

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Stewart: That was a very fitting tribute, Rob. We're gonna miss you on the show.
Corddry: Why thank you, Jon. But wherever I go and whatever I do, there'll always be a part of me here.
Stewart: Wow...that's a really sweet thing to say.
Corddry: No no no, I'm not kidding. It's in the second floor men's room, actually. That's what you get for not giving me a proper send off.
Stewart: You're really gonna go out on a poop joke?
Corddry: I have to stay true to myself, Jon.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Corddry cites Stewart as a profound influence on his comedy, crediting Stewart for teaching him how to focus on an idea in order to find the humor in it, and says that his ''The Daily Show'' pedigree earned him the clout to make ''Childrens Hospital''.&lt;ref&gt;Corddry, Rob (July 27, 2015). "Goodbye, and Goodnight". ''[[TV Guide]]''. p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the projects Corddry worked on after leaving ''The Daily Show'' was ''[[The Winner (TV series)|The Winner]]'', a 2007 TV series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tvsquad.com/category/the-daily-show|title=Television News, Reviews and TV Show Recaps |work=[[The Huffington Post]]|accessdate=February 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corddry has since made appearances on the show, both as a guest and as a correspondent. He was a guest on Jon Stewart's final episode.

==Film roles==
Corddry's played the title character in ''[[Blackballed: The Bobby Dukes Story]]'' (2004) and Mac, [[Ben Stiller]]'s character's best friend in ''[[The Heartbreak Kid (2007 film)|The Heartbreak Kid]]''.

(film)|W.]]'' as [[Ari Fleischer]], and also in ''[[What Happens in Vegas]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Jacks | first=Brian | url=http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2008/04/09/exclusive-rob-corddry-lands-role-of-press-secretary-ari-fleischer-in-oliver-stones-w/ | title=EXCLUSIVE: Rob Corddry Lands Role Of Press Secretary Ari Fleischer In Oliver Stone’s ‘W’ | publisher=MTV | date=April 9, 2008 | accessdate=2008-04-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, he co-starred in the [[John Cusack]] film ''[[Hot Tub Time Machine]]'' and in 2013 he co-starred in [[Jonathan Levine]]'s ''[[Warm Bodies (film)|Warm Bodies]]'' as the zombie M.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/movies/news/a457986/rob-corddry-on-warm-bodies-it-was-easy-playing-a-zombie.html|title=Rob Corddry: 'Warm Bodies role was easy'|date=February 11, 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most successful filmmakers in [[Indian film|Indian cinema]], Bhansali is the recipient of several awards, including four [[National Film Awards]] and ten [[Filmfare Awards]]. In 2015, the [[Government of India]] honoured him with the [[Padma Shri]], the fourth highest civilian award.

Bhansali made his directorial debut with ''[[Khamoshi: The Musical]]'' (1996), for which he received the [[Filmfare Critics Award for Best Film]]. He rose to prominence in Indian cinema with the commercially successful and widely acclaimed romantic drama ''[[Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam]]'' (1999), the romantic drama ''[[Devdas]]'' (2002) — which received nomination for the [[BAFTA Award for Best Film|Best Foreign Film]] at [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|British Academy of Film &amp; Television Awards (BAFTA)]] —  and the drama ''[[Black (2005 film)|Black]]'' (2005), for all of which he received multiple [[Filmfare Best Director Award|Best Director Award]]s and [[Filmfare Best Film Award|Best Film Award]]s along with additional Critics Award for Best Film for the latter at Filmfare Awards, and multiple National Film Awards for the latter two. However, he followed it by directing consecutive commercially flop films such as ''[[Saawariya]]'' (2007) and [[Guzaarish (2010 film)|''Guzaarish'']] (2010), however, ''Guzaarish'' received positive reviews from critics and audiences.

This changed with his adaptation of [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' — the tragic romance ''[[Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela]]'' (2013) — opened to positive reviews and strong box office collections, for which he received several awards and nominations.

His period dramas ''[[Bajirao Mastani]]'' (2015) and ''[[Padmaavat]]'' (2018) rank among the [[List of highest-grossing Indian films|highest-grossing Indian films of all time]]. For the former, he won the [[National Film Award for Best Direction]], as well as Best Director and Best Film Awards at Filmfare.

== Career ==
Bhansali began his career as an assistant to [[Vidhu Vinod Chopra]] and was involved in the making of ''[[Parinda]]'', ''[[1942: A Love Story]]'' and ''[[Kareeb]]''. However, they had a falling-out when Bhansali refused to direct ''Kareeb''. In 1996, he made his directorial debut with ''[[Khamoshi: The Musical]]'', the commercially unsuccessful but critically acclaimed narration of a daughter's struggle to communicate with her deaf-mute parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/film/reviews/film.jsp?id=123378&amp;page=2|title=Khamoshi (Silence: The Musical) Review|publisher=[[Channel 4]]|accessdate=14 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film earned the Critics Award for Best film at Filmfare. He rose to prominence in Indian cinema with a triangular love story, ''[[Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam]]'', starring [[Aishwarya Rai]], [[Salman Khan]], and [[Ajay Devgan]], which established his individualistic stamp for visual splendour and creating auras of celebration and festivity. The film was premiered in the Indian Panorama section at the 1999 [[International Film Festival of India]].

His next film, ''[[Devdas (2002 Hindi film)|Devdas]]'', starring [[Shah Rukh Khan]], [[Aishwarya Rai]] and [[Madhuri Dixit]], was Bhansali's ode to the novel [[Devdas|of the same name]], which became the highest-grossing film of 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=208&amp;catName=MjAwMg== |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115223032/http://boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=208&amp;catName=MjAwMg== |archivedate=15 January 2013 |title=Box Office 2002 |publisher=Box Office India |accessdate=6 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film also received unanimous acclaim from the critics and won all the major accolades at Filmfare, emerging as the most awarded film in Filmfare, (tied with the 1995 ''[[Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge]]'').

'''Seymour Weiss''' (September 13, 1896 &amp;ndash; September 17, 1969)  was a prominent  [[hotel]] executive and civic leader from [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], who was a close confidante of the legendary [[Huey Long|Huey Pierce Long, Jr.]] Weiss, the most loyal of the Longites, bore the same last name as the apparent Long assassin, [[Carl Weiss]], [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]]

==Background==

Weiss was born in [[Bunkie, Louisiana|Bunkie]] in [[Avoyelles Parish, Louisiana|Avoyelles Parish]] and died in the capital city of [[Baton Rouge]]. His parents were Samuel Weiss, originally from [[Austria-Hungary]] and a merchant, and the former Gisella Elias, of [[Berlin, Germany]]. Seymour had three brothers: Bernard, Milton, and Julius. On January 10, 1954, Bernard and Milton died in a private [[airplane]] crash, along with [[Thomas Elmer Braniff]], the owner of the airline, and a number of other civic leaders from [[Shreveport]], Louisiana, and [[Dallas]], [[Texas]]. The men had been on a private hunting trip to [[South Texas]] and [[South Louisiana]]; the plane crashed in a freak ice storm. Weiss' last brother, Julius, died later the same year on August 30, 1954, of personal health issues. Seymour was educated in public schools in Bunkie and [[Abbeville, Louisiana|Abbeville]] in [[Vermilion Parish]]. For a time he was a [[department store]] clerk in [[Alexandria, Louisiana|Alexandria]] in [[Rapides Parish]] and the largest city in [[Central Louisiana]]. He moved to New Orleans in 1916 to clerk in a shoe store. After the United States' entry into [[World War I]], Weiss attended officers' training at [[Camp Gordon, Georgia]], but the conflict ended before Weiss finished his training. Thereafter, he returned to New Orleans to resume work as a shoe clerk.

Seymour was married twice: on April 19, 1925, to Notie "Fay" Turner, and then on June 12, 1963, to Elva Mae Lavie Kimball, whom he predeceased. He died in Baton Rouge and is interred at the family plot at [[Metairie Cemetery]] in New Orleans. (Plot: Sec. 34, Lot 19).

==The Roosevelt Hotel==
In 1923, Weiss became the manager of a [[barber]]shop at the [[The Roosevelt Hotel New Orleans|Grunewald Hotel]] in New Orleans. In 1924, he became the assistant hotel manager, and in 1928, he was promoted to hotel manager. First built in 1893, and known as the "Grunewald" (for its original owner, Louis Grunewald), the Grunewald opened what has been called the first [[nightclub]] in the [[United States]], a basement room decorated with fake [[stalactite]]s called "The Cave", where one could watch dancing chorus girls and listen to [[Dixieland jazz]] that would easily drown out the soothing indoor waterfalls. In 1923, a consortium of local investors purchased the hotel and renamed it "The Roosevelt" in honor of President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], who had died four years earlier.

In 1931, Weiss was named president of the New Orleans Roosevelt Corp. From 1931–1965, he was the principal owner and managing director of the Roosevelt. The Cave was closed in favor of a larger venue a floor above called "The Blue Room" which became a nationally prominent music venue. Weiss sold the Roosevelt in 1965. It became the [[The Roosevelt New Orleans|Fairmont Hotel]] until closing following [[Hurricane Katrina]]. In August 2007, Dimension Development Company, Inc, a Natchitoches, Louisiana-based hotel development and management company purchased the property, and is currently restoring the building with a scheduled opening date of June 25, 2009. Dimension Development Company Inc, entered into an agreement with [[Hilton Worldwide]] to brand the hotel under Hilton's premier [[Waldorf Astoria]] collection. The hotel has been rechristened The Roosevelt Hotel by [[Waldorf Astoria]]. A grand opening was held in 2009. Businessman Sam Friedman of [[Natchitoches, Louisiana|Natchitoches]] was heavily involved in the reopening. He is the son of the late [[Louisiana State Legislature|Louisiana State Senator]] [[Sylvan Friedman]]. 
Although he had no children, he was an uncle to Seymour Weiss, II, and S J. Weiss. His wife and sister-in-law died in a car accident, leaving behind two widowers, and two motherless children, one thirteen and one three. The father, his brother, took the thirteen-year-old, S.J., and the grandparents and Seymour took Seymour, II. Seymour, his parents, and "Little Seymour" lived in the hotel. Little Seymour married Sally McNulty and fathered Richard, David, and John Weiss.

==Loyal to Huey Long==
Weiss became a political booster of Huey Long, whom he met during the [[Louisiana gubernatorial election, 1928|1928 gubernatorial]] campaign. Weiss acted as Long's chief of protocol and resolved an unwitting comical dispute that developed when the governor received a [[Germany|German]] delegation at [[Mardi Gras]] in 1930 in a pair of [[pajama]]s, a red and blue robe, and blue bedroom slippers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Huey Pierce Long, Jr.]], ''Every Man a King: The Autobiography of Huey P. Long'' ([[New Orleans]]: National Book Club, Inc., 1933), pp. 192-193.&lt;/ref&gt;

Long made Weiss's Roosevelt Hotel his New Orleans headquarters. It was said that Weiss made sure Long never got lost in the hallways of the large facility. Weiss was the closest of friends and a regular golfing partner with Long. He was easily considered an "insider at Long's right hand." Weiss was present at the bedside of Long when he died from internal infection contracted during the attempt to remove the bullets in the assassination attempt.

Weiss became treasurer of both the Louisiana [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] Association and Long's secret political fund. During the [[Great Depression]], Weiss had control of federal relief funds in Louisiana. He was vice-president of the Win or Lose Corporation, a controversial oil company whose structure was devised by Huey Long. On Long's death, Weiss chaired the Huey P. Long Memorial Commission and remained active in the Long machine until scandals swept through the organization.

==Imprisonment for tax evasion==
In 1934, Weiss was indicted by a federal grand jury in New Orleans on [[tax evasion]] charges. He paid back taxes after the charges were dropped. He was indicted again on tax evasion and [[mail fraud]] charges growing out of the "Louisiana Scandals" of the late 1930s. He was convicted and imprisoned for sixteen months between 1940 and 1942, before he was [[paroled]] and ordered to pay back taxes. In 1947, he was given a full and unconditional pardon by Democratic [[U.S. President]] [[Harry Truman]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Truman Scandals and the Politics of Morality'', by Andrew J. Dunar. Discussed in Chapter 8, "The Corruption Issue in the 1952 Campaign"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Journal of Politics'', Vol. 10, No. 2 (May, 1948), pp. 385–409, ''Southern Governors,'' by Cortez A.M. Ewing&lt;/ref&gt;

==Weiss as civic leader==
Weiss was a member of the New Orleans Zoning Board and commissioner of the [[municipal]] fire and police departments between 1932 and 1936. He was also president of the board of commissioners of the Port of New Orleans from 1933–1938.

He was active in the American Hotel Association and was president of the Louisiana Hotel-Motel and the New Orleans Hotel associations. He won statewide awards for hotel management in 1952 and 1957. He was a director of the New Orleans chapter of the [[American Red Cross]], the [[Chamber of Commerce]], and the [[International Trade Mart]]. In 1968, Weiss chaired the committee for the 250th anniversary of the founding of New Orleans.

'''The Bowery Boys''' are fictional [[New York City]] characters, portrayed by a [[repertory theater|company]] of New York actors, who were the subject of feature films released by [[Monogram Pictures]] from 1946 through 1958.

The Bowery Boys were successors of the "[[East Side Kids]]," who had been the subject of films since 1940. The group originated as the "[[Dead End Kids]]", who originally appeared in the 1937 film ''[[Dead End (1937 film)|Dead End]].'' A few of the actors previously appeared together as "[[Little Tough Guys|The Little Tough Guys]]."

==Origins==

===The Dead End Kids===
{{main|Dead End Kids}}
"The Dead End Kids" originally appeared in the 1935 play ''Dead End,'' dramatized by [[Sidney Kingsley]]. When [[Samuel Goldwyn]] turned the play into a [[Dead End (1937 film)|1937 film]], he recruited the original "kids" from the play—[[Leo Gorcey]], [[Huntz Hall]], [[Bobby Jordan]], [[Gabriel Dell]], [[Billy Halop]], and [[Bernard Punsly]]—to appear in the same roles in the film. This led to the making of six other films that shared the collective title "The Dead End Kids".

===The Little Tough Guys===
{{main|Little Tough Guys}}
In 1938, [[Universal Pictures|Universal]] launched its own tough-kid series, "[[Little Tough Guys]]." Gradually, Universal recruited most of the original Dead End Kids, so the series ultimately featured "[[The Dead End Kids]] and [[Little Tough Guys]]." Universal made twelve feature films, and three 12-chapter serials with the gang. The final film in Universal's series, ''[[Keep 'Em Slugging]],'' was released in 1943, with [[Bobby Jordan]] replacing erstwhile ringleader [[Billy Halop]].

===The East Side Kids===
{{main|East Side Kids}}
When Warner Brothers released the remaining Dead End Kids from their contracts in 1939, producer [[Sam Katzman]] at Monogram acted quickly and hired several of them, including Jordan and the Gorcey brothers, Leo and David, as well as some of the Little Tough Guys, including Hally Chester, to star in a new series using the team name "The East Side Kids."  These films also introduced [[Sammy Morrison|'Sunshine' Sammy Morrison]], one of the original members of the [[Our Gang]] comedy team, as part of the gang.

The original members of the "Dead End Kids" were now working at several studios, so these films were made at the same time that Universal was making "The Dead End Kids" and "Little Tough Guys" series. A total of 21 films were made, with the final one, ''Come Out Fighting'', released in 1945.

==The Bowery Boys==

In 1945, when East Side Kids producer Katzman refused to grant Leo Gorcey's request to double his weekly salary, Gorcey quit the series, which then ended immediately. Bobby Jordan then suggested a meeting with his agent, Jan Grippo. Grippo, Gorcey, and Hall formed Jan Grippo Productions, revamped the format, and rechristened the series ''The Bowery Boys.'' (The earlier films's credits appear as "Leo Gorcey ''and'' The Bowery Boys".) Gorcey, who owned 40 percent of the company, starred, produced, and contributed to the scripts. The new series followed a more established formula than the prior incarnations of the team, with the gang usually hanging out at Louie's Sweet Shop (at 3rd &amp; Canal St.) until an adventure came along.

The original main characters were Terrence Aloysius "Slip" Mahoney ([[Leo Gorcey]]), Horace Debussy "Sach" Jones ([[Huntz Hall]]), Bobby ([[Bobby Jordan]]), Whitey ([[William "Billy" Benedict|Billy Benedict]]), and Chuck ([[David Gorcey]], sometimes billed as David Condon). [[Ernest Morrison|"Sunshine" Sammy Morrison]], "Scruno" in the East Side Kids films, declined the invitation to rejoin the gang. (He later stated in an interview that he "didn't like the setup", possibly referring to the idea of Gorcey and Hall being in the forefront, and being paid much more than the other members.) When Bobby Jordan quit the series for the same reason, his character was replaced by Butch Williams, with former East Side Kids [[Bennie Bartlett]] and [[Buddy Gorman]] alternating in the role. The proprietor of the malt shop where they hung out was the panicky Louie Dumbrowski ([[Bernard Gorcey]], Leo's and David's real-life father).

Like the previous incarnations of the team, the members went through a number of changes over the course of the series. Thirteen actors were members of the team at one time or another. Bobby Jordan, an original Dead End Kid, appeared in the first eight films, but left after being injured in an elevator accident. Jordan was also unhappy with the direction of the series, which favored Gorcey and Hall, and limited the participation of the other gang members.

[[Gabriel Dell]] returned in the fourth entry, ''[[Spook Busters]]'' (1946), as "Gabe Moreno," a former member of the gang just out of the Navy with a French war-bride in tow. He remained (minus spouse) for the next 16 features. Gabe was a convenient "utility" character, frequently changing jobs (private investigator, policeman, songwriter, reporter, Nazi spy) to suit the story at hand—and the limited casting budget. Dell often acted as a bridge between the real world and those of the Boys who he would summon to assist him. He reprised one of his East Side Kids roles in ''[[Hard Boiled Mahoney]]'' (1947), playing Gabe as a myopic nerd with thick glasses, ascot and cap. His final appearance was in ''[[Blues Busters (1950 film)|Blues Busters]]'' in 1950, generally regarded as one of the funniest in the series.

The early films such as ''[[In Fast Company]]'' (1946) flirted with the same humor-laced crime drama of the previous series, but they gradually shifted to all-out comedy, growing more slapstick and fantasy-oriented over the next decade. After 1950, the series began to resemble the farcical [[Abbott and Costello]] comedies—a far cry from the grim social realism of their 1930s films. The grittiness of the old days was sanitized with the gang's dingy basement club-house replaced by an ice cream parlor. The "boys" also adopted a more adult look, exchanging their sloppy, juvenile wardrobe for suits.

The team spirit of the ensemble cast faded as Huntz Hall was elevated to co-star status to showcase his comedic skills. The stories now focused entirely on Slip (the self-proclaimed leader of the bunch) and his zany sidekick, Sach, with the diminished three or four "boys" receding into the background with little to do. Time and again the plot revolved around Sach accidentally acquiring some strange power or ability (he becomes a psychic, champion wrestler, crooner, etc.) that Slip is quick to exploit. In most of the films, the gang pursues a scheme for quick riches or gets mixed up with neighborhood thugs. Story elements from their earlier films (haunted houses, mad scientists, nefarious spies) were also frequently incorporated into the new series.

Like a streetwise [[Abbott and Costello]], Gorcey and Hall became a cohesive comedy duo, extending their verbal and physical humor into broader slapstick comedy that served to increase the popularity of the series.  In 1953, [[Edward Bernds]], a new producer and director who had previously worked with [[The Three Stooges]], transformed the series into lucrative kiddie-matinée fodder, with Gorcey and Hall re-enacting gags borrowed from the Stooges. (Huntz Hall cited [[Shemp Howard]], who had appeared in three Little Tough Guys films, as a major influence during this latter phase in the series.)

Leo's character "Slip" was famed for his [[malaprop]]s (always delivered in a [[Brooklyn accent]]), such as "a clever seduction" for "a clever deduction," "I depreciate it!" ("I appreciate it!"), and "I regurgitate" ("I reiterate").

In the 1940s, [[Abbott and Costello]] appeared in a quartet of "service comedies", one for each branch of the military. The Bowery Boys duplicated this feat a decade later with ''[[Bowery Battalion]],'' ''[[Let's Go Navy!]],'' ''[[Here Come the Marines]],'' and ''[[Clipped Wings (1953 film)|Clipped Wings]].'' Abbott and Costello spoofed westerns: ''[[Ride 'Em Cowboy (1942 film)|Ride 'Em Cowboy]]'' (1942), the upper-classes: ''[[In Society]]'' (1944), and hillbillies: ''[[Comin' Round the Mountain]]'' (1951). The Bowery Boys repeated this formula in ''[[Bowery Buckaroos]]'' (1947), ''[[High Society (1955 film)|High Society]]'' (1955), and ''[[Feudin' Fools]]'' (1952), respectively.

Abbott and Costello went on safari: ''[[Africa Screams]]'' (1949), to the Middle East: ''[[Lost in a Harem]]'' (1944), and even tangled with pirates in ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet Captain Kidd]]'' (1952). Once again, the Bowery Boys followed suit with ''[[Jungle Gents]]'' (1954), ''[[Bowery to Bagdad]]'' (1955), and ''[[Hold That Hypnotist]]'' (1957). Abbott and Costello become private detectives in ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet the Invisible Man]]'' (1951); the Bowery Boys open up a detective agency in 1953's ''Private Eyes''.

After Abbott and Costello's haunted-house comedy ''[[Hold That Ghost]]'' (1941) became a smash hit, the East Side Kids released the similar ''Spooks Run Wild'' with Bela Lugosi later that year. Lugosi went on to help make ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein]],'' one of A&amp;C's most popular and critically acclaimed comedies. The basic premise, centered around Dracula's scheme to transplant Costello's brain into the Frankenstein monster (played by [[Glenn Strange]]), was duplicated a few months later by The Bowery Boys in ''[[Master Minds]]'' (1949). Glenn Strange once again plays a hulking monster who switches minds with Sach (Huntz Hall). With a title suggesting a send-up of the Abbott and Costello "Meet" films, ''[[The Bowery Boys Meet the Monsters]]'' (1954) was the highest grossing entry in the series.

After filming ''[[Dig That Uranium]]'' in 1955, Bernard Gorcey was killed in an automobile accident, devastating his son Leo, who began to drink heavily, and it visibly affected his performance in the following film, ''Crashing Las Vegas'', which was his last. (During filming, he became violently unhinged, trashing the set and destroying every prop in sight.{{cn|date=December 2017}}) At a subsequent meeting with Allied Artists, Gorcey demanded an increase on the 40% interest he held in the series. This was denied, and after a heated exchange, he quit the series and stormed off the studio lot.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

The studio owed exhibitors three more films for the 1956 season, so Gorcey was replaced by [[Stanley Clements]], a former tough-teen actor who had been in a few East Side Kids movies. Clements, as "Duke Coveleskie," adapted to the series easily and completed the three films, which now starred "Huntz Hall and The Bowery Boys." The new Hall-Clements partnership was successful enough to be renewed for the 1957 season. Four more films were made, with Eddie LeRoy joining the cast as bespectacled "Blinky." With Bernard Gorcey gone, Louie's Sweet Shop was replaced by Clancy's Cafe with a similarly put-upon proprietor, "Mike" ([[Percy Helton]], later played by [[Dick Elliott]]).

==Legacy==

In all, there were 48 Bowery Boys films, making it the longest feature-film series of American origin in motion picture history (only the Mexican ''[[El Santo|Santo]]'' film series ran longer), with the final film, ''[[In the Money]],'' being released in 1958. Only Huntz Hall and David Gorcey had remained with the series since 1946.&lt;ref&gt;''Me and the Dead End Kid,'' Leo Gorcey, Jr., Spirit of Hope Publishing, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bowery Boys and East Side Kids picked up a new generation of mostly younger fans when the films were repackaged and syndicated for television in the 1960s and 1970s. They became a staple for independent stations across the U.S., often used to fill up the early-afternoon time-slots on weekends.

All 48 Bowery Boys films were released on DVD by Warner Brothers via their "made-to-order" Archive Collection label in four volumes, each consisting of 12 films on 4 recordable media discs, beginning November 20, 2012. Initial distribution was advertised by Warner as being traditionally replicated on "pressed disc" media in anticipation of high demand for these first Bowery Boy releases to be "remastered from the best available elements."

'''Thomas Jefferson Rusk''' (December 5, 1803{{spaced ndash}}July 29, 1857) was an early political and military leader of the [[Republic of Texas]], serving as its first [[Secretary of War]] as well as a general at the [[Battle of San Jacinto]]. He was later a US politician and served as a Senator from Texas from 1846 until his suicide. He served as the [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate|President pro tempore]] of the [[United States Senate]] in 1857.

== Early life ==
Rusk was born in [[Pendleton, South Carolina]], to John Rusk, a [[stonemason]], and Mary Sterritt Rusk. After being [[Admission to the bar in the United States|admitted]] to the [[Bar (law)|bar]] in 1825, Rusk began his law practice in [[Clarkesville, Georgia]]. In 1827, he married Mary F. (Polly) Cleveland, the daughter of [[General officer|General]] John Cleveland. Rusk became a business partner of his father-in-law after the marriage. He lived in the gold region of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and made sizable mining investments. In 1834, however, the managers of the company in which he had invested embezzled all the funds and fled to [[Mexican Texas]]. Rusk pursued them to [[Nacogdoches, Texas|Nacogdoches]], but never recovered the money.

== Texas Revolution ==
Rusk decided to stay in Texas and became a citizen of [[Mexico]] in 1835, applied for a headright in [[David G. Burnet]]'s colony, and sent for his family. After hearing Nacogdoches citizens denounce the despotism of Mexico, Rusk became involved in the independence movement. He organized volunteers from Nacogdoches and hastened to Gonzales, where his men joined [[Stephen F. Austin]]'s army in preventing the Mexicans from seizing their [[cannon]]. They proceeded to [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]], but Rusk left the army before the [[Siege of Bexar]].

The provisional government named him [[inspector general]] of the army in the Nacogdoches District. As a delegate from Nacogdoches to the [[Convention of 1836]], Rusk not only signed the [[Texas Declaration of Independence]] but also chaired the committee to revise the constitution of the [[Republic of Texas]]. The ''ad interim'' government, installed on March 17, 1836, appointed Rusk as Secretary of War. When informed that [[Alamo Mission in San Antonio|the Alamo]] had fallen and the Mexican army was moving eastward, Rusk helped [[List of Presidents of the Republic of Texas|President]] David Burnet to move the government to [[Harrisburg, Houston, Texas|Harrisburg]].

After the Mexicans killed all [[James Fannin|James W. Fannin's]] Texan army at [[Goliad, Texas|Goliad]], Burnet sent Rusk with orders for General [[Sam Houston]] to make a stand against the enemy. Rusk participated with bravery in the defeat of [[Antonio López de Santa Anna|Santa Anna]] on April 21, 1836, in the [[Battle of San Jacinto]]. From May to October 1836, he served as commander-in-chief of the [[Army of the Republic of Texas]], with the rank of [[brigadier general]]. He followed the Mexican troops westward as they retired from Texas to be certain of their retreat beyond the [[Rio Grande]]. Then he conducted a military funeral for the troops killed at Goliad.

The men of Texas deserved much credit, but more was due the women. Armed men facing a foe could not but be brave; but the women, with their little children around them, without means of defense or power to resist, faced danger and death with unflinching courage.

==Republic of Texas==
[[File:TJRusk.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Thomas Jefferson Rusk]]
In the first regularly elected administration, President Houston appointed Rusk secretary of war, but after a few weeks, Rusk resigned to take care of pressing domestic problems. At the insistence of friends, however, he represented Nacogdoches in the Second Congress of the Republic (1837–1838). Rusk was a [[Freemasonry|Mason]]. He joined [http://www.milamlodge2.com/Homepage.htm Milam Lodge No. 40] (Later Milam Lodge #2) in Nacogdoches in 1837 and was a founding member of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20130110190218/http://grandlodgeoftexas.org/ Grand Lodge of Texas], organized in [[Houston, Texas|Houston]] on December 20, 1837.

As chairman of the House Military Committee in 1837, he sponsored a [[militia]] bill that passed over Houston's veto, and Congress elected Rusk [[major general]] of the [[militia]]. In the summer of 1838, he commanded the Nacogdoches militia, which suppressed the Córdova Rebellion. In October, when Mexican agents were discovered among the [[Kickapoo people|Kickapoo Indians]], Rusk defeated those Indians and their Indian allies. He captured marauding [[Caddo]] Indians in November 1838 and risked an international incident when he invaded United States territory to return them to the Indian agent in [[Shreveport, Louisiana]].

On December 12, 1838, the Texas Congress elected Rusk [[Chief Justice]] of the Republic's [[Supreme Court of the Republic of Texas|Supreme Court]]. He served until June 30, 1840, when he resigned to resume his law practice. Later he headed the [[bar (law)|bar]] of the Republic of Texas. He and [[James Pinckney Henderson|J. Pinckney Henderson]], later the first [[List of Texas Governors|governor of the state of Texas]], formed a law partnership in 1841.

Early in 1843, Rusk was called upon once again to serve as a military commander. Concern over the lack of protection on the frontier caused Congress, in a joint ballot on January 16, 1843, to elect Rusk major general of the militia of the Republic of Texas. But he resigned in June when Houston obstructed his plans for aggressive warfare against Mexico. Rusk then turned his energies to establishing Nacogdoches University (operated 1845–1895).&lt;ref name=NacUni&gt;{{cite web |url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/kbn01 |title=NACOGDOCHES UNIVERSITY |author=Robert Bruce Blake |work=Handbook of Texas Online |publisher=[[Texas State Historical Association]] |date=2010-06-15 |accessdate=2015-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served as [[vice president]] of the university when the charter was granted in 1845 and president in 1846.&lt;ref name=NacUni /&gt;

== State of Texas ==

Rusk supported Sam Houston and the growing movement to [[Texas annexation|annex Texas]] to the United States. He was president of the Republic's [[Texas annexation#Tyler's preemption of Texas annexation|Convention of 1845]], which accepted the annexation terms.  The first Texas state legislature elected him and Houston to the [[United States Senate]] in February 1846. Rusk received the larger number of votes and the longer term of office.

Rusk and Houston forgot past differences as they worked to settle the southwest boundary question in favor of Texas' claim to the Rio Grande. Rusk supported the position of US President [[James K. Polk]] on the necessity of the [[Mexican–American War|Mexican War]] and the acquisition of California. In the debate over the [[Compromise of 1850]], Rusk refused to endorse [[secession]], proposed by some in the caucus of Southern congressmen. He vigorously defended Texas' claims to the land used to create the [[New Mexico Territory]] in 1850, arguing for financial compensation for Texas.

As an early advocate of a transcontinental railroad through Texas, Senator Rusk made speeches in the Senate and throughout Texas in support of a southern route. The [[Gadsden Purchase]] received his support. Rusk was in favor of the [[Kansas–Nebraska Act]]. President [[James Buchanan]] offered him the position of [[United States Postmaster General]] in 1857, but he turned it down. (Buchanan gave the post to [[Aaron V. Brown]])

While Rusk attended to duties in Washington, D.C., his wife died of [[tuberculosis]] on April 23, 1856. Five of their seven children were still living at the time. During a special session in March 1857, he was elected [[president pro tempore of the United States Senate]].

Missing his wife and ill from a [[tumor]] at the base of his neck, Rusk committed suicide by a self-inflicted gunshot wound on July 29, 1857. He was 53 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fru16 |title=Rusk, Thomas Jefferson |author=Priscilla Myers Benham |work=The Handbook of Texas Online |publisher=[[Texas State Historical Association]] |date=2015-08-18 |accessdate=2015-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
* The State of Texas placed a monument at the graves of Rusk and his wife, Mary, in Oak Grove Cemetery in [[Nacogdoches, Texas]].
*[[Rusk County, Texas|Rusk County]] and the town of [[Rusk, Texas|Rusk]] were named in his honor.
* Part of his homestead became the campus of [[Stephen F. Austin State University]].

Work at the Stonehenge prehistoric monument was carried out between 1919 and 1926, largely by Hawley alone, at times assisted by Robert Newall, a draughtsman from the Office of Works. The weather and the confusing [[stratigraphy]] of this site made work difficult, but Hawley was able to make numerous breakthroughs regarding the history of activity on the site.

The first task was the supervised righting of some of the fallen stones, late in 1919. Hawley dug out the foundations before the stones were replaced. Hawley was employed by the Office of Works, the antecedent of the [[Ministry of Works (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Works]] who had been passed responsibility for Stonehenge when it had been donated to the nation in 1918. They were primarily concerned with the danger of falling stones, but funds were made available for Hawley to continue his investigations long after the righting work was finished.

Hawley identified the [[Aubrey Holes]] for the first time, as well as the [[Y and Z Holes]] and a variety of other [[posthole]]s and stone holes within the centre of the monument. He found many of the cremated and uncremated human remains which first indicated a funerary role for Stonehenge. Excavations of the [[avenue (archaeology)|Avenue]], the ditch ([[Heelstone Ditch]]) around the [[Heelstone]], and the trench (Arc Trench) leading up to the Heelstone were also undertaken.

Hawley proved, from a thin stratum of stone chip debris he called the Stonehenge Layer, that the earthwork features, the Aubrey Holes and some of the other postholes and burials constituted earlier phases of activity that predated the erection of the megaliths. He also found an antler pick embedded in a lump of chalk, indicating the construction method on site. Eventually he settled on three phases: the earthwork enclosure, a large stone circle now vanished that supposedly stood in the Aubrey Holes, and finally a larger megaliths phase involving the extant stones as Stonehenge 3. Hawley's model of a multiphase site did not agree with the contemporary interpretation and was ignored until [[Richard J. C. Atkinson|Richard Atkinson]] revived the idea in the 1950s. Although later considerably refined, his multi-phase interpretation is now fully accepted.

Certain of Hawley's other ideas, such as Stonehenge being a fortified settlement, were further off the mark and he died before his work was recognised.

Artefacts excavated by Hawley at Stonehenge are displayed in the Wessex Gallery of Archaeology at the [[The Salisbury Museum|Salisbury Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.archaeology.co.uk/articles/reviews/salisbury-museum.htm|title=Salisbury Museum|last=|first=|date=8 October 2014|website=Current archaeology|publisher=|language=en-GB|access-date=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Selected samples were also sent to the [[Ashmolean Museum|Ashmolean]] (Oxford), the [[Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, University of Cambridge|Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology]] (Cambridge), the [[National Museum Cardiff|National Museum of Wales]] (Cardiff), and the [[British Museum]] (London).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ashmolean.org/ash/faqs/q006/q006002.html|title=Ashmolean Museum; British Archaeology: Stonehenge and the Ashmolean|last=|first=|date=|website=www.ashmolean.org|publisher=|access-date=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
