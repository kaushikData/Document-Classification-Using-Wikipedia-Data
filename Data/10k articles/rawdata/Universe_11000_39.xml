The '''Australian School of Petroleum''' is a centre for petroleum education, training and research at the [[University of Adelaide]] in [[South Australia]]. The school integrates teaching and research programs in the disciplines of petroleum [[geoscience]], [[Petroleum engineering|engineering]] and [[management]] and was formed in 2003. It is housed in the purpose-built Santos Petroleum Engineering Building on the University's [[North Terrace]] campus. As of 2015 the Head of the school is Steve Begg. Prior to his appointment at the university in 2002, he worked for 19 years in the oil and gas industry; for 13 of those for [[BP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.adelaide.edu.au/directory/steve.begg|title = Professor Steve Begg|date = 2015-01-28|accessdate = 2015-02-09|website = The University of Adelaide - University Staff Directory|publisher = The University of Adelaide|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The [[University of Adelaide]] established the National Centre for Petroleum Geology and Geophysics (NCPGG) on campus in 1986. The School of Petroleum Engineering and Management (SPEM) was also established in 2000.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.asp.adelaide.edu.au/about/|title = Australian School of Petroleum - About - History|date = |accessdate = 2015-02-08|website = University of Adelaide|publisher = University of Adelaide|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter development was facilitated by a commitment to the University of AU $25 million made by oil and gas company, [[Santos Limited]] in 1999. At the time it was believed to be 'the largest single industry sponsorship ever given to a public university in Australia.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.adelaide.edu.au/news/news82.html|title = News &amp; events - $25 million Santos sponsorship a major boost for industry|date = 1999-08-13|accessdate = 2015-02-08|website = University of Adelaide|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 August 2001, Professor Peter Behrenbruch was appointed as the first Head of SPEM. He had been previously employed as Chief Reservoir Engineer with [[BHP Billiton]], and a partnership between the school and his former employer soon followed.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.adelaide.edu.au/news/news269.html|title = BHP Billiton announces $100,000 funding|date = 2001-09-07|accessdate = 2015-02-08|website = The University of Adelaide|publisher = The University of Adelaide|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2003, the NCPGG and the SPEM merged to form the Australian School of Petroleum.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Partnerships ==
BHP Billiton became the first corporate partner to follow Santos' original commitment of AU $25 million. The multi-national resource company committed $100,000 to funding research at the school, to be dispensed across 2002 and 2003.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; During a visit in 2001, Keith Hunter from BHP Billiton said of the relationship: &lt;blockquote&gt;"We are looking forward to employing graduates from the School in four years time... We have also asked Professor Behrenbruch to develop some in-house courses for engineers already employed in BHP Billiton."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The University's Vice-Chancellor Cliff Blake said of the school's relationship with corporate sponsors:&lt;blockquote&gt;"The company (Santos Ltd) and the University intended the School to operate as a major resource for the benefit of the entire oil and gas industry."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Scholarships and prizes ==
The school offers scholarships and presents prizes annually to undergraduate and postgraduate students. Scholarships include:&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.asp.adelaide.edu.au/scholarships/|title = Australian School of Petroleum - Scholarships|date = |accessdate = 2015-02-09|website = University of Adelaide|publisher = University of Adelaide|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Santos Limited|Santos]] Scholarships (which include half, full and incentive scholarships)
* John F Kennedy Memorial Scholarship 
* [[Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association|APPEA]] Oil and Gas Industry Engineering Scholarship for Indigenous Australians 
* [[Society of Petroleum Engineers]] Scholarship
Sixteen prizes are awarded annually, fourteen of which are sponsored by industry partners. Sponsors include: [[Beach Energy]], Bear and Brook Consulting, [[BP]], [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron Australia]], [[ConocoPhillips]], [[ExxonMobil]], [[Origin Energy]], [[Santos Limited|Santos]], [[Shellac|Shell]] and [[Woodside Energy]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

A '''bed warmer'''  was a common household item in countries with cold [[winter]]s, especially in [[Europe]].{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}  It consisted of a [[metal]] container, usually fitted with a handle and shaped somewhat like a modern [[frying pan]], with a solid or finely perforated lid.  The pan would be filled with river stones preheated from the fireplace and placed under the [[bed sheet|cover]]s of a [[bed]], to warm it up and/or dry it out before use.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} 

After the invention of [[rubber]], the classical bed warmer was largely supplanted by the [[hot water bottle]], which is still widely used.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}  In the early&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=VygDAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA62&amp;as_pt=MAGAZINES&amp;pg=PA62#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; 20th century, [[electric blanket]]s and then the [[electric bed warmer]], (containing a lampholder and low wattage light bulb), were invented to fulfill the same need.

[[File:Vuillaume violin backside.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Bookmatched maple violin back]]
'''Bookmatching''' is the practice of matching two (or more) wood or stone surfaces, so that two adjoining surfaces mirror each other, giving the impression of an opened book. 

As applied to wood, bookmatching is usually done with [[Wood veneer|veneer]] (produced in one of several ways), but can also be done with solid wood. The technique is used to beautify a variety of objects such as furniture, [[violin]]s, [[guitar]]s or the interior of high-luxury cars. The two adjoining surfaces are produced from the same piece of wood, so that they have (almost) exactly the same appearance, but mirrored. The final effect varies with the figure of the wood chosen and can range from extremely subtle (so that the two surfaces almost appear to be a single piece of wood), to dramatic effects with wavy grain showcased, as in high-end guitars.

Bookmatching is also possible with [[marble]] or other patterned stone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.globalgranite.com/tips-and-trends/faq_39 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-07-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141115142521/http://www.globalgranite.com/tips-and-trends/faq_39# |archive-date=2014-11-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cubana de Aviación Flight 9646''' was a chartered [[Ilyushin Il-62M]] airliner, ([[Aircraft registration|registered]] CU-T1281) operated by [[Cubana de Aviación|Cubana]], that crashed on 3 September 1989, shortly after [[takeoff]] from [[José Martí International Airport]].&lt;ref name="ASN"/&gt; 

Flight 9646 was due to operate a non-scheduled international [[Havana]]–[[Milan]]–[[Cologne]] passenger service. The crash resulted in the deaths of all 126 occupants of the aircraft plus 24 people on the ground.{{#tag:ref|According to ''Aviation Safety Network''.&lt;ref name="ASN"/&gt; Another source informed the number of ground casualties to be 14.&lt;ref name="FI1990"/&gt;|group="nb"}}

==Accident==
The aircraft took off in heavy rain and wind gusts of {{convert|30|-|50|mph}}.&lt;ref name="ASN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FI1989-4"/&gt; The [[Aircrew|crew]] retracted the flaps from their initial 30° position to 15°, in an attempt to gain speed, but this action reduced the ability of the aircraft to provide [[Lift (force)|lift]].&lt;ref name="FI1989-17"/&gt; The plane climbed to about {{convert|53|m}}, where it was hit by a downdraft that caused the airframe to strike the end of the runway, subsequently hitting a navigational facility and a small hill before crashing into a residential area, about one minute after takeoff.&lt;ref name="FI1989-17"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ASN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FI1989-4"/&gt; All 126 people on board—115 passengers, most of them Italian holidaymakers, and a crew of 11&lt;ref name="FI1989-4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jet With 54 on Board Missing in Brazil : Disappears Over Amazon; Toll in Cuban Crash May Reach 150" /&gt;—perished in the accident. An additional 24 people, who were not aboard the aircraft also lost their lives as a result of the accident.&lt;ref name="ASN"/&gt;

==Cause==
Investigators attributed the crash of Flight 9646 to the pilot's decision to fly after an abrupt deterioration in the meteorological conditions.

{{nihongo|'''''Daigo Fukuryū Maru'''''|第五福龍丸||'''''F/V Lucky Dragon 5'''''}} was a Japanese [[tuna]] [[fishing boat]] with a crew of 23 men which was contaminated by [[nuclear fallout]] from the United States [[Castle Bravo]] [[thermonuclear weapon]] test at [[Bikini Atoll]] on March 1, 1954.

The crew suffered [[acute radiation syndrome]] (ARS) for a number of weeks after the Bravo test in March. During their [[acute radiation syndrome|ARS treatment]], the crew were inadvertently infected with [[hepatitis C]] through [[blood transfusions]].&lt;ref name="mainichi.jp"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mainichi.jp/english/english/perspectives/news/20140517p2a00m0na005000c.html |title=As I See It: Gov't must delve deeper into radiation exposure from Bikini Atoll incident|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140524051201/http://mainichi.jp/english/english/perspectives/news/20140517p2a00m0na005000c.html|archive-date=May 24, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All recovered except for Aikichi Kuboyama, the boat's chief radioman, who died on September 23, 1954, from an underlying [[liver cirrhosis]] compounded by the secondary hepatitis C infection.&lt;ref name="Rhodes1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Rhodes|title=Dark Sun: The Making of the Hydrogen Bomb|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f113iCcn87wC|date=6 August 1996|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-0-684-82414-7|page=542}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kuboyama is considered the first victim of the [[Thermonuclear weapon|hydrogen bomb]] and of test shot Castle Bravo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wagingpeace.org/castle-bravo-sixty-years-of-nuclear-pain/|title=Castle Bravo: Sixty Years of Nuclear Pain|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140707174139/http://www.wagingpeace.org/castle-bravo-sixty-years-of-nuclear-pain/|archive-date=July 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Early days and final voyage==
Built in March 1947 and launched from [[Koza, Wakayama]], the boat was originally named {{nihongo|'''''Dainana Kotoshiro Maru'''''|第七事代丸||''Kotoshiro Maru No. 7''}}. It was a [[bonito]] boat and moored in [[Misaki]] Fishing Harbor, [[Kanagawa Prefecture]]. It was later remodeled into a [[tuna fishing]] boat. In 1953, it moved to [[Yaizu, Shizuoka|Yaizu Port, Shizuoka Prefecture]], with a new name, ''Daigo Fukuryū Maru'', translated as ''Lucky Dragon No. 5'' or the ''Fifth Lucky Dragon''.

The ''Lucky Dragon No. 5'' took five ocean voyages, the last of which began on January 22, 1954, and ended on March 14 of that year. The crew set off to go fishing in the Midway Sea near [[Midway Atoll]], but when they lost most of their [[trawl net]]s to the sea, they altered their course southward near the [[Marshall Islands]] and encountered fallout from the Castle Bravo nuclear test at Bikini Atoll on March 1.&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcf.city.hiroshima.jp/virtual/VirtualMuseum_e/exhibit_e/exh0503_e/exh05032_e.html |title=Lucky Dragon No. 5  special exhibit |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010232525/http://www.pcf.city.hiroshima.jp/virtual/VirtualMuseum_e/exhibit_e/exh0503_e/exh05032_e.html |archivedate=October 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A map of the varying location of the boat in the days leading up to and after the day of the explosion is available. On March 1, the map depicts the vessel very near to the border of the [[US Navy]] issued "danger zone notice" dated October 10, 1953.&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"/&gt; Following March 1, the vessel charted a practically straight [[geodesic]] course back to its home port of Yaizu, passing the same [[latitude]] as [[Wake Island]] between March 4 and 6 and arriving at Yaizu on March 14.&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"/&gt;

The source of the map,&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"/&gt; does not state how the map was created, that is, it does not state that the [[ship log|ship's log]] was consulted in the creation of the map, nor does it provide the [[navigator]]'s measurements with the [[compass]] and [[sextant]] of the period.&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"/&gt; The exact position of the ship on the day of the explosion is therefore uncertain. Contemporary references give a figure of "80 miles east of Bikini Atoll" without stating the method by which the distance was computed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=opAklHndAy8C&amp;pg=PA6&amp;dq=%22fukuryu+maru%22+ash&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=DJmTU_HpNaWL7Aau6YCQBw&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22fukuryu%20maru%22%20ash&amp;f=false Structure shielding against fallout gamma rays from nuclear detonations By Lewis Van Clief Spencer, Arthur B.

[[File:Daigo Fukuryu Maru.jpg|thumb|right|Daigo Fukuryū Maru in early 1950s, shortly before the incident]]
The ''Daigo Fukuryū Maru'' encountered the [[nuclear fallout|fallout]] from the U.S. Castle Bravo nuclear test at Bikini Atoll, near the [[Marshall Islands]], on March 1, 1954. When the test was held, the ''Daigo Fukuryū Maru'' was catching fish outside the danger zone that the U.S. government had declared in advance. However, the test was more than twice as powerful as predicted, and changes in weather patterns blew nuclear fallout, in the form of a fine ash, outside the danger zone.&lt;ref name="brit"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Arnold |first1=Lorna  |authorlink1=Lorna Arnold |last2=Smith |first2=Mark |year=2006 |title=[[Britain, Australia and the Bomb]] |publisher=Palgrave Press |page=77 |isbn=978-1-4039-2101-7 |oclc=76350829}}&lt;/ref&gt; On that day, the sky in the west lit up like a sunset. Seven minutes later, the sound of the explosion arrived, with fallout reaching the ship two hours later.&lt;ref name="select.nytimes.com"&gt;Leonard Engel, [https://www.nytimes.com/1958/02/23/archives/twentythree-fishermen-and-a-bomb-the-voyage-of-the-lucky-dragon-by.html "Twenty-Three Fishermen and a Bomb; The Voyage of the Lucky Dragon"], ''New York Times", February 23, 1958, p. BR1.&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=August 2014}} The fishermen attempted to escape from the area,{{citation needed|date = May 2013}} but they took time to retrieve fishing gear from the sea, exposing themselves to radioactive fallout for several hours.

The fallout – fine white flaky dust of [[calcinated]] Bikini Island [[coral]], which absorbed highly radioactive [[fission product]]s and [[neutron activation|neutron activated isotopes]] – fell on the ship for three hours.{{when|date=June 2014}}{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} The fishermen scooped it into bags with their bare hands. One fisherman, Matashichi Oishi, reported that he "took a lick" of the dust that fell on his ship, describing it as gritty but with no taste.&lt;ref name="search.japantimes.co.jp"&gt;Hoffman, Michael, "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fb20110828a1.html Forgotten atrocity of the atomic age]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', August 28, 2011, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The dust stuck to surfaces, bodies and hair; after the radiation sickness symptoms appeared,{{when|date=June 2014}} the fishermen called it {{nihongo|''shi no hai''|死の灰||'''death ash'''}}.

===Events between March 2–14===
{{Expand section|date=June 2014}}

===Events after return to Yaizu port===

Japanese biophysicist Yasushi Nishiwaki immediately traveled from [[Osaka]] to Yaizu to examine the crew and their boat.  He quickly concluded that they had been exposed to radioactive fallout and wrote a letter to the chief of the US [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] (AEC) asking for more information on how to treat the crew.  The crew members, suffering from nausea, headaches, burns, pain in the eyes, bleeding from the gums, and other symptoms, were diagnosed with [[acute radiation syndrome]] and admitted to two [[Tokyo]] hospitals. On September 23, chief radio operator Aikichi Kuboyama, 40, died—the first Japanese victim of a hydrogen bomb.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} He left these words: "I pray that I am the last victim of an atomic or hydrogen bomb."&lt;ref name="brit" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/mail/ed20090301a2.html|title=The Japan Times|date=March 1, 2009|accessdate=March 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=June 2014}}  The US did not respond to Nishiwaki's letter or to letters from other Japanese scientists requesting information and help,&lt;ref&gt;[[Kyodo News]], "[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20120111b1.html Scientist immediately sought details from U.S. on 1954 Bikini H-bomb test]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', January 11, 2012, p. 2.  Nishiwaki's letter, as of January 2012, was on display at the [[National Atomic Testing Museum]] in Nevada.&lt;/ref&gt; although the United States did dispatch two medical scientists to Japan to study the effects of fallout on the ship's crew and to assist their doctors.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Schaller|title=Altered States: The United States and Japan since the Occupation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D1KFROHI6cUC&amp;pg=PA72|year=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-802337-1|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chasing Loose Nukes"&gt;{{cite book|author=Derek Duke|title=Chasing Loose Nukes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y8QGts0KLw0C&amp;pg=PA9|publisher=Dungan Books|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The US government refused to disclose the fallout's composition due to "national security", as the fallout's isotopic ratios—namely a percentage of [[uranium-237]]—could reveal the design of the Castle Bravo device through [[nuclear forensics|radio-chemical analysis]], with this information having a history of being regarded as potentially revealing the means by which megaton yield nuclear devices achieve their yield.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.princeton.edu/sgs/publications/sgs/pdf/2_4DeGeer.pdf The Radioactive Signature of the Hydrogen Bomb].&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, [[Joseph Rotblat]] may have deduced the [[Teller-Ulam design|staging nature]] of the device by studying the ratio and presence of tell-tale isotopes present in the fallout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Reiner Braun|title=Joseph Rotblat: Visionary for Peace|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AGlav1OGtikC&amp;pg=PA188|year=2007|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-3-527-40690-6|page=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 1954, the [[Soviet Union]] had [[Soviet atomic bomb project|not yet been successful with thermonuclear staging]] and such information could have assisted in their development of a thermonuclear weapon. [[Lewis Strauss]], the head of the AEC, issued a series of denials; he also hypothesized that the lesions on the fishermen's bodies were not caused by radiation but by the chemical action of the caustic [[burnt lime]] that is produced when coral is calcined, that they were inside the danger zone. He told [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|President Eisenhower's]] press secretary that the ''Lucky Dragon #5'' may have been a "red spy outfit", commanded by a Soviet agent intentionally exposing the ship's crew and catch to embarrass the USA and gain intelligence on the test's device.&lt;ref&gt;Schreiber, Mark, "[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/fl20120318x1.html Lucky Dragon's lethal catch]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', March 18, 2012, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, the United States expanded the danger zone and it was revealed that in addition to the ''Daigo Fukuryū Maru'', many other fishing boats were in the expanded zone at the time. It is estimated that about one hundred fishing boats were contaminated to some degree by fallout from the test.&lt;ref name="titus" /&gt; Despite denials by Lewis Strauss concerning the extent of the claimed contamination of the fish caught by ''Daigo Fukuryu Maru'' and other ships, the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] later imposed rigid restrictions on tuna imports.&lt;ref name="titus"&gt;{{cite book|author=A.

The majority of medical experts believe that the crew members were infected with [[hepatitis C]] through [[blood transfusions]] during part of their [[acute radiation syndrome]] treatment.&lt;ref name="mainichi.jp"/&gt;

==Health history of crew==
{{Expand section|date=June 2014}}
Like the [[hibakusha]], survivors of atomic bombings in Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, the Lucky Dragon crew were stigmatized because of the Japanese public’s [[radiophobia|irrational fear of those exposed to radiation]] (it was commonly believed to be contagious). The crew tried to stay quiet about their exposure for a number of decades, beginning with their discharge from hospital. A number of the crew also had to move away from their previous places of residence to make a fresh start.&lt;ref name="manchester.ac.uk"/&gt;

Former crew members include the 87-year-old, as of 2014, Susumu Misaki, who opened a tofu shop after the incident.&lt;ref name="mainichi.jp"/&gt;

Twenty years old at the time, Matashichi Oishi, who is reported to have licked the mysterious fallout substance which fell on his ship in March 1954, as a taste test to ascertain its properties,&lt;ref name="search.japantimes.co.jp"/&gt; was 79 years old in August 2013. After the exposure, he left his hometown to open a dry cleaning business. Beginning in the 1980s, he frequently gave talks advocating [[nuclear disarmament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2013/08/06/national/victim-of-bikini-atoll-h-bomb-fallout-keeps-the-faith/#.U5K9nldkb0s |title=Victim of Bikini Atoll H-bomb fallout keeps the faith}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, he published a book titled, "The Day the Sun Rose in the West: The Lucky Dragon and I."

==Radioactivity of the ship post contamination==
{{Expand section|date=June 2014}}
[[File:Daigo Fukuryū Maru 02.JPG|thumb|right|The ship in its museum in 2007]]
The ''Daigo Fukuryū Maru'' was deemed safe for public viewing and was preserved in 1976. It is now on display in Tokyo at the Tokyo Metropolitan Daigo Fukuryū Maru Exhibition Hall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://d5f.org/ 都立 第五福竜丸展示館 Official Site&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hiroshimapeacemedia.jp/mediacenter_d/w_museum/20090130142323620_en.html The Tokyo Metropolitan Daigo Fukuryu Maru Exhibition Hall]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media==
The Toho Film ''Gojira'' (''[[Godzilla (1954 film)|Godzilla]]'', 1954), was inspired in part by this event. The ship itself appears on a poster in 2001's ''Godzilla, Mothra, King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack'', which also features Godzilla coming ashore and wreaking havoc in the Yaizu area.

A poem, ''Japon Balıkçısı'' (The Japanese Fishermen), was written in 1956 by Turkish poet [[Nâzım Hikmet Ran]] about the events.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.siir.gen.tr/siir/n/nazim_hikmet/the_japanese_fisherman.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ralph Lapp]] wrote ''[[The Voyage of the Lucky Dragon]]'', which was published in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ralph E. Lapp|title=The Voyage of the Lucky Dragon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VeuJHmVUWxAC|year=1958|asin=B0000CJZ45}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reviewed on the front page of ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]''.&lt;ref name="select.nytimes.com"/&gt;

A film version of the events, [[Lucky Dragon No. 5 (film)|''Daigo Fukuryū Maru'']] (1959), was directed and screenwritten by [[Kaneto Shindo]], and produced by [[Kindai Eiga Kyokai]] and ''Shin Seiki Eiga''.

'''David W. Pearce''' [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire|OBE]] (11 October 1941 – 8 September 2005) was [[Professor|Emeritus Professor]] at the Department of Economics at [[University College London]] (UCL).  He specialised in, and was a pioneer of, [[environmental economics]], having published over fifty books and over 300 academic articles on the subject, including his 'Blueprint for a Green Economy' series.

==Background==
David Pearce was born in [[Harrow, London]] on 11 October 1941, and attended Harrow Weald county grammar school, now part of [[Harrow College]]. He graduated in [[Politics, Philosophy, and Economics]] from [[Lincoln College, Oxford]] in 1963 (1st class) and then studied economics at [[London School of Economics]] from 1963 to 1964. He  held academic posts at the Universities of [[Lancaster University|Lancaster]], [[University of Southampton|Southampton]], Leicester (from 1974-1979), and Aberdeen (Chair in political economy until 1983) before arriving at UCL as Professor of Political Economy and later in Economics in 1983, retiring in 2004.

During his career he was the chief environmental adviser to the UK Secretaries of State between 1989 and 1992—[[Christopher Patten]] and [[Michael Heseltine]]. He also provided advice to a number of major companies. He was a convening lead author of the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]].

He was co-director of the environmental economics research centre, [[CSERGE]] (Centre for Social and Economic Research on the Global Environment), from 1991 to 2001.  Pearce also established the internationally renowned [[Master's degree|MSc]] in Environmental and Resource Economics at UCL.  He was an inspirational teacher held in the highest esteem by the many graduates of this degree, most of whom are now working in environmental policy making and research throughout the world.

Pearce married Sue in 1966 and had two sons, Daniel and Corin. He lived latterly in Saffron Walden, Essex.

==Scholarship==
Pearce is best known for setting out economic valuation techniques for natural phenomena, arguing that the environment is "under-priced" and that environmental services may be calculated.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/news-articles/0509/05092101&lt;/ref&gt; If they are, their true worth is more likely to be recognised.  His early work was on cost-benefit analysis and the economics of pollution and natural resource depletion, before these ideas entered the mainstream of the economic sciences and policymaking. ''Blueprint for Green Economy'' was published in 1989 (with Anil Markandya and Ed Barbier), and was a bestselling work with strong influence on governments in Britain and beyond. It advocated basing policy on the criterion of "sustainability", valuing environmental effects, and making use of market incentives. Market-based policies such as pollution taxes, tradable permits and conservation payments have some of their origins in Pearce's work—for example, Britain's landfill tax, the EU's emissions trading scheme and the various mechanisms for international pollution offsets in the [[Kyoto Protocol]].

For Pearce, [[sustainability]] involved each generation passing on at least as much capital as it inherited. Environmental capital describes the stock and the state of natural resources. Economic damage was inevitable but could be controlled through realistic valuation in the market; the price of precious resources, or penalties for damaging them, should be set high (e.g. for noise, waste, global warming, risks to life and health, species conservation and biodiversity).&lt;ref name="GuardianObit"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2005/sep/22/highereducation.guardianobituaries | title=Obituary: David Pearce | publisher=TheGuardian.com | first=Stephen | last=Smith | date=21 September 2005 | accessdate=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without this, future generations would suffer.

His love for nature and his care for the environment resonate through his work. At the same time, he was fiercely critical of environmental alarmism and sloppy environmental policy.&lt;ref&gt;D.W. Pearce (2006), [[Energy Economics (journal)|Energy Economics]], 28: 149-158&lt;/ref&gt;{{editorializing|date=December 2012}}. The "valuation" of natural phenomena was widely debated and challenged, sometimes by critics who saw Pearce as a supporter of market-based, neoliberal economic policy.&lt;ref name="GuardianObit" /&gt;

Pearce was commissioned by the [[Construction Research and Innovation Strategy Panel]] to write a report about the construction industry &lt;ref&gt; Pearce, D. (2003) ''The social and economic value of construction'' pub. New Construction Industry Research and Innovation Strategy Panel&lt;/ref&gt; and after his death, a special issue of the journal Building Research &amp; Information was dedicated to his memory in 2006.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5652">The '''drift velocity''' is the [[average velocity]] that a particle, such as an [[electron]], attains in a material due   to an [[electric field]]. It can also be referred to as axial drift velocity. In general, an electron will propagate randomly in a [[Electrical conductor|conductor]] at the [[Fermi velocity]]. An applied electric field will give this random motion a small net flow velocity in one direction.

In a [[semiconductor]], the two main carrier scattering mechanisms are [[ionized impurity scattering]] and [[lattice scattering]].

Because current is proportional to drift velocity, which in a resistive material is, in turn, proportional to the magnitude of an external electric field, [[Ohm's law]] can be explained in terms of drift velocity.

The most elementary expression of [[Ohm's law]] is:

:&lt;math&gt;  u= \mu E ,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''u''}} is the drift velocity, {{math|''μ''}} is the [[electron mobility]] (with units m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/([[volt|V]]⋅s)) of the material and {{math|''E''}} is the [[electric field]] (with units V/m).

==Experimental measure==
The formula for evaluating the drift velocity of charge carriers in a material of constant [[cross-section (geometry)|cross-section]]al area is given by:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Griffiths|first=David|title=Introduction to Electrodynamics|year=1999|publisher=Prentice-Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|page=289|edition=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;u = {j \over n q} ,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''u''}} is the drift velocity of electrons, {{math|''j''}} is the [[current density]] flowing through the material, {{math|''n''}} is the charge-carrier [[number density]], and {{math|''q''}} is the [[electric charge|charge]] on the charge-carrier.

This can also be written as:

:&lt;math&gt;j = nqu&lt;/math&gt;

But the current density and drift velocity, j and u, are in fact vectors, so this relationship is often written as:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J} = \rho \mathbf{u} \,&lt;/math&gt;

where 

:&lt;math&gt;\rho = nq &lt;/math&gt;

is the [[charge density]] (SI unit: coulombs per [[cubic metre]]).

In terms of the basic properties of the right-[[cylindrical]] [[electrical current|current]]-carrying [[metal]]lic [[electrical conductor|ohmic conductor]], where the charge-carriers are [[electrons]], this expression can be rewritten as {{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}:

:&lt;math&gt;u = {m \; \sigma \Delta V \over \rho e f \ell} ,&lt;/math&gt;

where
*{{math|''u''}} is again the drift velocity of the electrons, in [[metre|m]]⋅[[second|s]]&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;
*{{math|''m''}} is the [[molecular mass]] of the metal, in [[kg]]
*{{math|''σ''}} is the [[electric conductivity]] of the medium at the temperature considered, in [[siemens (unit)|S]]/[[metre|m]].
*{{math|Δ''V''}} is the [[voltage]] applied across the conductor, in [[volt|V]]
*{{math|''ρ''}} is the [[density]] ([[mass]] per unit [[volume]]) of the conductor, in [[kg]]⋅[[metre|m]]&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;
*{{math|''e''}} is the [[elementary charge]], in [[coulomb (unit)|C]]
*{{math|''f''}} is the number of [[electron|free electrons]] per [[atom]]
*{{math|''ℓ''}} is the [[length]] of the conductor, in [[metre|m]]

== Numerical example ==
Electricity is most commonly conducted in a copper wire. [[Copper]] has a density of {{val|8.94|u=g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}, and an [[atomic weight]] of {{val|63.546|u=g/mol}}, so there are {{val|140685.5|u=mol/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}. In one [[Mole (unit)|mole]] of any element there are {{val|6.02|e=23}} atoms ([[Avogadro's constant]]). Therefore, in {{val|1|u=m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} of copper there are about {{val|8.5|e=28}} atoms ({{nowrap|{{val|6.02|e=23}} × {{val|140685.5|u=mol/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}}}). Copper has one free electron per atom, so {{math|''n''}} is equal to {{val|8.5|e=28}} electrons per cubic metre.

Assume a current {{nowrap|1={{math|''I''}} = 1 ampere}}, and a wire of {{val|2|u=mm}} diameter (radius = {{val|0.001|u=m}}). This wire has a cross sectional area of {{val|3.14|e=-6|u=m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} ({{nowrap|1={{math|''A''}} = π × ({{val|0.001|u=m}})&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}). The charge of one [[electron]] is {{nowrap|1={{math|''q''}} = {{val|-1.6|e=-19|u=C}}}}. The drift velocity therefore can be calculated:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  u &amp;= {I \over nAq}\\
  u &amp;= \frac{1 \text{C}/\text{s}}{\left(8.5 \times 10^{28} \text{m}^{-3}\right) \left(3.14 \times 10^{-6} \text{m}^2\right) \left(1.6 \times 10^{-19} \text{C}\right)}\\
  u &amp;= 2.3 \times 10^{-5} \text{m}/\text{s}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Dimensional analysis:

&lt;math&gt;
  u = \dfrac{\text{A}}{\dfrac{\text{electron}}{\text{m}^3}{\cdot}\text{m}^2\cdot\dfrac{\text{C}}{\text{electron}}}
    = \dfrac{\dfrac{\text{C}}{\text{s}}}{\dfrac{1}{\text{m}}{\cdot}\text{C}}
    = \dfrac{\text{m}}{\text{s}}
&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, in this wire the electrons are flowing at the rate of {{val|23|u=μm/s}}. At 60&amp;nbsp;Hz alternating current, this means that within half a cycle the electrons drift less than 0.2 &amp;mu;m. In other words, electrons flowing across the contact point in a switch will never actually leave the switch.

By comparison, the Fermi flow velocity of these electrons (which, at room temperature, can be thought of as their approximate velocity in the absence of electric current) is around {{val|1570|u=km/s}}.&lt;ref&gt;http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/electric/ohmmic.html Ohm's Law, Microscopic View, retrieved 2015-11-16&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Endothermic]] gas''' is a gas that inhibits or reverses [[oxidation]] on the surfaces it is in contact with. This gas is the product of incomplete [[combustion]] in a controlled environment. An example is [[hydrogen gas]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[nitrogen gas]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and [[carbon monoxide]] (CO). The hydrogen and carbon monoxide are [[reducing agent|reducing agents]], so they work together to shield surfaces from oxidation.

Endothermic gas is often used as a carrier gas for gas [[carburizing]] and [[carbonitriding]]. An endothermic gas generator could be used to supply heat to form an [[endothermic reaction]].&lt;ref name=Herring&gt;{{cite web|last1=Herring|first1=Daniel H.|title=Principles and Use of Endothermic Gas Generators|url=http://heat-treat-doctor.com/documents/Endothermic%20Gas%20Generators.pdf|website=heat-treat-doctor|accessdate=28 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Synthesised in the catalytic retort(s) of endothermic generators, the gas in the endothermic atmosphere is combined with an additive gas including [[natural gas]], [[Propane|propane ]] (C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;) or air and is then used to improve the surface chemistry work positioned in the furnace.&lt;ref name=berry&gt;{{cite web|last1=Berry|first1=Theodore P.|title=AN OVERVIEW OF ENDOTHERMIC GENERATORS|url=http://www.mcgoff-bethune.com/furnace/endo.pdf|website=mcgoff-bethune|accessdate=28 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Endothermic Gas Generator Diagram.jpeg|thumb|Endothermic Gas Generator Diagram]]

There are '''two''' common purposes&lt;ref name=Herring&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; of the atmospheres in the heat treating industry: 
# Protect the processed material from surface reactions (chemically inert)
# Allow surface of processed material to change (chemically reactive) 

'''Principal Components''' of Endothermic Gas Generators &lt;ref name=berry&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;:
# '''Heating Chamber''' for supplying heat by electric heating elements of [[combustion]],
# Vertical '''cylindrical retorts''', 
# Tiny, porous '''ceramic''' pieces that are saturated with [[nickel]], which acts as a [[catalyst]] for the reaction, 
# '''Cooling heat exchanger''' in order to cool the products of the reaction as quickly as possible so that it reaches a particular temperature which stops any further reaction,
# '''Control system''' which will help maintain the consistency of the temperature of the reaction which will help adjust the gas ratio, providing the wanted dew point.

'''Chemistry''' of Endothermic Gas Generators&lt;ref name=Herring&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;:
* N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ([[Nitrogen]]) → 45.1% (volume)
* CO ([[Carbon Monoxide]]) → 19.6% (volume)
* CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ([[Carbon Dioxide]]) → 0.4% (volume)
* H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ([[Hydrogen]]) → 34.6% (volume)
* CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; ([[Methane]]) → 0.3% (volume)
* [[Dew Point]] → +20/+50
* Gas Ratio → 2:6:1

'''Applications''' of Endothermic Gas Generators&lt;ref name=Herring&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;: 
# Annealing: Iron and Steel 
# [[Brazing]]: Copper and Silver 
# Carbon Restoration: Carburizing, Carbonitriding, Nitrocarburizing 
# Neutral Hardening: Low, medium and high alloy carbon steels 
# Normalizing: Iron and Steel 
# Sintering: Powder Metals 

It is relatively simple to operate and maintain endothermic gas generators, however, maintenance such as the burnout process is often overlooked.&lt;ref name=Pye&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pye|first1=David|title=Heat Treating Process|url=https://www.asminternational.org/documents/10192/1914052/htp00207p037.pdf/d711c8f7-b88a-4dd2-965a-24ed4b9b474a/HTP00207P037|accessdate=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

'''Troubleshooting''' the Endothermic Gas Generator (Cracking at 1040°C)&lt;ref name=Pye&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;:
* When the due point is high and the carbon potential is low, it often leads to an air leak. This should be prevented by checking seals, joints as well as flanges. One should also check the retort for leakage. Checking the compressor by checking the position and location of the sample point is also ideal to prevent air leakage. 
* When the due point is low and the carbon potential is high, one should check the catalyst in retort (Burnout). The cooler on discharge should also be checked along with piping to furnace.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18349">[[Image:Hailwood-Horrobin EMC graph.svg|thumb|300px|Equilibrium moisture content of wood versus humidity and temperature, according to the Hailwood-Horrobin equation.]]

The '''equilibrium moisture content''' ('''EMC''') of a [[hygroscopic]] material surrounded at least partially by air is the [[moisture content]] at which the material is neither gaining nor losing moisture. The value of the EMC depends on the material and the [[relative humidity]] and [[temperature]] of the air with which it is in contact. The speed with which it is approached depends on the properties of the material, the [[surface-area-to-volume ratio]] of its shape, and the speed with which humidity is carried away or towards the material (e.g. [[diffusion]] in stagnant air or [[convection]] in moving air).

== Equilibrium moisture content of grains ==

The moisture content of grains is an essential property in food storage. The moisture content that is safe for long-term storage is 12% for corn, sorghum, rice and wheat and 11% for soybean&lt;ref name="sadakam"&gt;Sadakam, Samy Grain Drying Tools: Equilibrium Moisture Content Tables and Psychrometric Charts. Univ. Arkansas, FSA1074&lt;/ref&gt;
 
At a constant relative humidity of air, the EMC will drop by about 0.5% for every increase of 10&amp;nbsp;°C air temperature.&lt;ref name="FAO2011"&gt;FAO. 2011. Rural structures in the tropics. Design and development. Chapter 16: Grain crop drying, handling, and storage. Rome. http://www.fao.org/docrep/015/i2433e/i2433e10.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The following table shows the equilibriums for a number of grains (data from &lt;ref name="sadakam" /&gt;). These values are only approximations since the exact values depend on the specific variety of a grain.&lt;ref name="FAO2011" /&gt;

== Equilibrium moisture content of wood ==

The [[moisture]] content of wood below the [[fibre saturation point|fiber saturation point]] is a function of both [[relative humidity]] and [[temperature]] of surrounding air. The moisture content (''M'') of wood is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;M = \frac{m-m_{od}}{m_{od}}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''m'' is the mass of the wood (with moisture) and &lt;math&gt;m_{od}&lt;/math&gt; is the oven-dry mass of wood (i.e. no moisture).&lt;ref&gt;What is Equilibrium Moisture Content? http://www.wagnermeters.com/wood-moisture-meter/moisture-content-and-equilibrium-determined-by-relative-humidity/&lt;/ref&gt; If the wood is placed in an environment at a particular temperature and relative humidity, its moisture content will generally begin to change in time, until it is finally in equilibrium with its surroundings, and the moisture content no longer changes in time. This moisture content is the EMC of the wood for that temperature and relative humidity.

The '''Hailwood-Horrobin equation''' for two hydrates is often used to approximate the relationship between EMC, temperature (''T''), and relative humidity (''h''):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

where ''M''&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt; is the equilibrium moisture content (percent), ''T'' is the temperature (degrees Fahrenheit), h is the relative humidity (fractional) and:

:&lt;math&gt;W  = 330   + 0.452\,T              + 0.00415\,T^2            &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;k  = 0.791 + 4.63\times 10^{-4}\,T - 8.44\times 10^{-7}\,T^2 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;k_1= 6.34  + 7.75\times 10^{-4}\,T - 9.35\times 10^{-5}\,T^2 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;k_2= 1.09  + 2.84\times 10^{-2}\,T - 9.04\times 10^{-5}\,T^2 &lt;/math&gt;

This equation does not account for the slight variations with wood species, state of mechanical stress, and/or [[hysteresis]]. It is an empirical fit to tabulated data provided in the same reference, and closely agrees with the tabulated data. For example, at T=140 deg F, h=0.55, EMC=8.4% from the above equation, while EMC=8.0% from the tabulated data.

== Equilibrium moisture content of sands, soils and building materials ==
Materials such as stones, sand and ceramics are considered 'dry' and have much lower equilibrium moisture content than organic material like wood and leather. &lt;ref&gt;Leivo, Virpi &amp; Rantala, Jukka. (2003). Moisture Behavior of Slab-On-Ground Structures&lt;/ref&gt; typically a fraction of a percent by weight when in equilibrium of air of [[Relative humidity]] 10% to 90%. This affects the rate that buildings need to dry out after construction, typical cements starting with 40-60% water content. 
This is also important for construction materials such as render reinforced with organic materials, as modest changes in content of different types of straw and wood shavings  have a significant influence on the overall moisture content&lt;ref&gt;An experimental investigation on equilibrium moisture content of earth plasters with natural reinforcement fibres for straw bale buildings Taha Ashour, Heiko Georg , Wei Wu &lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Fender Champ''' was a [[guitar amplifier]] made by [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]]. It was introduced in 1948 and discontinued in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;Teagle, J. and Sprung, J.: Fender Amps: The First Fifty Years&lt;/ref&gt; An updated version was introduced in 2006 as part of the "Vintage Modified" line.

The Champ had the lowest power output and the simplest circuit for all of the Fender [[Vacuum tube amplifier|tube amps]]. The Champ had only one power tube, and the power stage circuit is, typically, [[Single-ended signalling|single-ended]] and [[Class-A amplifier|class A]]. Five [[watt]]s and the simple toneful circuit allowed the Champ to be used easily and often in recording studios.

== Champion 800/600 ==
First introduced in 1948, it sported the name "Champion 800"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Isadore |first=Jason |url=http://myfenderchamp.com/2010/08/04/fender-champion-800-serial-number-591/ |title=Champion 800 |publisher=Myfenderchamp.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; (with 8" speaker), changing a year later to "Champion 600" (6" speaker) with circuit designation 5B1. It was rated at about 3 watts, featuring a "T.V. Front" style cabinet; the 800 was covered in greenish fabric while the 600 featured two-tone blonde and brown vinyl covering. This style lasted until 1953, when Fender's cabinet style changed to the "Wide Panel" design with a [[Tweed (Fender)|tweed cloth covering]]. Fender also renamed the circuit the "5C1", "5" standing for the decade (1950s), "C" for the third circuit revision, and "1" was the Champ's circuit designation. The 5C1&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Isadore |first=Jason |url=http://myfenderchamp.com/2010/03/11/fender-champ-5c1-wiring-diagram/ |title=5C1 circuit |publisher=Myfenderchamp.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; circuit was extraordinarily simple, using one 6SJ7 pentode in the preamplifier section to provide a single stage of voltage amplification, one 6V6 beam power tetrode in the power amplifier section, a 5Y3 rectifier tube and a single volume knob with no tone controls.

==The Champ==
By 1955 Fender started putting its amps in the "Narrow Panel" tweed cabinet with a plastic oxblood color grill cloth,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Isadore |first=Jason |url=http://myfenderchamp.com/2009/09/12/grill-cloth/ |title=1959 Tweed Fender Champ Grill Cloth &amp;#124; My Fender Champ &amp;#124; Vintage Amps |publisher=My Fender Champ |date= |accessdate=2012-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by this time the Champ was officially named the Champ (model 5E1). Through 1957, Champs only had a six-inch speaker, but the 1958 model 5F1 featured an 8". The 5E1&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Isadore |first=Jason |url=http://myfenderchamp.com/2010/03/17/fender-champ-5e1-wiring-diagram/ |title=5E1 |publisher=Myfenderchamp.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 5F1&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Isadore |first=Jason |url=http://myfenderchamp.com/2010/03/29/fender-champ-5f1-wiring-diagram/ |title=5F1 |publisher=Myfenderchamp.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; circuits used a [[12AX7]] dual triode in the preamplifier to provide two stages of voltage amplification, and a single 6V6GT power tube to produce about 5 watts.  A Champ from this era can easily be dated by the code stamped on the tube chart,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Isadore |first=Jason |url=http://myfenderchamp.com/2009/08/29/how-to-date-a-fender-tweed-champ/ |title=How to Date a Tweed Fender Champ Amplifier by the Tube Chart &amp;#124; My Fender Champ &amp;#124; Vintage Amps |publisher=My Fender Champ |date= |accessdate=2012-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the code stamped on the speaker&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Isadore |first=Jason |url=http://myfenderchamp.com/2009/10/13/how-to-date-a-tweed-fender-champ-amplifier-by-the-speaker-code/ |title=How to Date a Tweed Fender Champ Amplifier by the Speaker Code &amp;#124; My Fender Champ &amp;#124; Vintage Amps |publisher=My Fender Champ |date= |accessdate=2012-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; or by its serial number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Isadore |first=Jason |url=http://myfenderchamp.com/2009/10/26/how-to-date-a-tweed-fender-champ-by-serial-number/ |title=How to Date a Tweed Fender Champ Amplifier by Serial Number &amp;#124; My Fender Champ &amp;#124; Vintage Amps |publisher=My Fender Champ |date=2009-12-01 |accessdate=2012-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Blackface/Silverface==
The 5F1 lasted until 1964, when the Champ finally made the transition to the "Blackface" style of circuit and cabinet. A small number of the last 5F1 style cabinets were covered with the "Blackface" amp cosmetics around this transition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Isadore |first=Jason |url=http://myfenderchamp.com/2009/12/06/transition-fender-champ-c-22845/ |title=transition |publisher=Myfenderchamp.com |date=2010-07-20 |accessdate=2012-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the factory most likely ran out of the tweed cloth covering. In 1964, a Champ with tremolo was also introduced. It was called the [[Fender Vibro Champ|Vibro Champ]]. The Champ switched from [[Blackface (Fender)|Blackface]] to [[Silverface]] four years later. Fender brought back the blackface cosmetics for a short time in 1981 before discontinuing the Champ the following year.

==Champion 600 reissue==
In 2006, Fender "reissued" the Champion 600. Cosmetically similar to the original Champion 600,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://myfenderchamp.com/category/champion-600/ |title=Champion 600 |publisher=Myfenderchamp.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; internally it features a modified blackface Champ circuit (with the settings of the [[tone stack]] being hard-wired rather than adjustable via Treble and Bass controls, and a couple of additional resistors reducing input-stage gain) and a switch to solid-state rectification from the original [[5Y3]] tube. The current look is the TV-front with two-tone tolex and speaker grille cloth of imitation suede. For a time after Fender's takeover of [[Gretsch]], the same electronics were available with a different look and feel – based on "tweed" Fender amps, despite the branding – as the [[Gretsch]] G5222 Electromatic. Production of the Champion 600 reissue ceased in 2010 and was reintroduced by Fender in late 2014. As of 2016, the Champion 600 was once again discontinued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.andertons.co.uk/p/2330104900/combo-amps/fender-champion-600-amp |title=Fender Champion 600 Amp |publisher=Andertons.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vibro Champ==
The '''Fender Vibro Champ''' was a [[guitar amplifier]] made by [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]]. It was first introduced in 1964 and discontinued in 1982. The Vibro Champ featured built-in tremolo with controls for speed and intensity. The [[silverface]] version served as a basis for the [[Fender Bronco Amp|Bronco]] student amplifier of 1967.&lt;ref&gt;Fender Amps:The First 50 Years&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vibro Champ XD==
In 2007, Fender reintroduced the Vibro Champ as the '''Vibro Champ XD''', part of their "Vintage Modified" series. Aesthetically, the XD is based on the Champ from the [[Blackface (Fender)|blackface]] era. Unlike the Champion 600, which has a strictly all-tube audio signal path, the Vibro Champ XD's tube circuitry is complemented by a [[digital signal processor]] (DSP) that functions as a pre-amp by modelling 16 different amplifiers. The effect of the volume, gain and tone control knobs varies according to the selected amp model. The digitally modelled signal is fed into a class-A single-ended tube circuit, with a [[12AX7]] output tube driver, and a 6V6 output tube. The amp also comes equipped with DSP effects, including reverb, delay, chorus, tremolo, and Vibratone (there is no spring reverb tank).

===Specifications===
* Available as an 8" combo
* 5 watt RMS class-A, single-ended
* Controls: gain, volume, voicing, treble, bass, FX level, FX select
* 1 input, 1 channel
* 1 4 ohm speaker output, 1 line-level output (back panel)
* 1× 12AX7 and 1× 6V6
* Solid-state diode-rectified
* DSP provides 16 effects settings, including chorus, delay, tremolo, reverb, and Vibratone
* Made in China

==Super Champ==
In 1982, in order to combat its decreasing amp sales, which at that time was around 10,000 units per year, Fender hired Paul Rivera (of [[Rivera Amplifiers]]) and asked him to help design amplifiers with a modern sound. Even though he did not personally create the new designs his direction of the engineering team, headed by Mark Wentling, resulted in some legendary amps. The result included the Super Champ, featuring a 10" speaker and new circuitry, including spring reverb, master volume, a switchable extra gain stage for a 'lead' effect, and a mid boost switch.&lt;ref name="autogenerated69"&gt;Teagle, J. and Sprung, J.: ''Fender Amps: The First Fifty Years'', p.69&lt;/ref&gt; In order to increase gain and cut costs, the Super Champ utilized 1× 12AX7 for the first and second stage preamp, a 1× 12AT7 for spring reverb driver tube, while a triple-triode 6C10 [[compactron]] is used for three functions; one as a third stage preamp for even more gain, one as the phase inverter (instead of two for most class-AB circuits), and one as recovery for the spring reverb. When the volume knob is pulled, some signal from the 12AT7 reverb driver is re-routed, resulting in higher gain. An optional two-button footswitch allowed for gain switching and reverb on/off. Two 6V6 power tubes provide it with 18 RMS watts. The cabinet was finished in black Tolex, with a black control panel and silver grille cloth. A more expensive version was available, factory-fitted with a Fender-branded EV Force 10 speaker instead of the usual Fender Blue Label. The Super Champ was sold until 1986.

===Specifications===
* Available as a 10" combo, features an internal 8 ohm speaker; some with output jack, some hardwired
* 18 watt RMS
* Controls: volume (pull for lead), treble (pull for mid boost), bass, reverb, lead level, master. 
* 1-input, 2-channel
* 1× [[12AX7|7025]], 1× [[12AT7]], 1× [[6C10]] Triple triode and 2× [[6V6]]
* Solid-state diode rectified
* Accutronics 3-spring reverb
* Class AB, push–pull

==Champ II==
Introduced along with the Super Champ described above, the Champ II was the most basic of the tube amps in the "Rivera-era" range of Fenders, having no reverb or extra gain switching.&lt;ref name="autogenerated69"/&gt; It was discontinued in 1983, along with the Bassman 20 (with which it shared the same metal chassis design), three years before the rest of the range, perhaps because its dearth of features was unfashionable at the time. It had the same colour scheme, power supply, output stage and stock speaker as the Super Champ but the preamp and phase inverter consisted of two 12AX7 tubes.

===Specifications===
* Available as a 10" combo, features an internal 8 ohm speaker output jack
* 18 watt RMS
* Controls: volume, treble (pull for mid boost), bass, master. 
* 1 input
* 2× [[12AX7|7025]], 2× [[6V6]]
* Solid-state diode-rectified
* Class AB, push–pull

==Super Champ XD==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2008}}
In 2007, Fender resurrected the Super Champ name with the '''Super Champ XD''', part of their "Vintage Modified" series. The look is based on the blackface model. Although for a limited period of time a special edition Blonde version was produced, Fender’s Consumer Relations Department states that the blonde special edition Super Champ XD with oxblood grill was a FSR (factory special run) that was limited to only 1,000 produced. The blonde version is no longer available new and Fender has completed the amps' production run so no more will be produced or available from Fender. Unlike the Champion 600 (all tube circuitry), the Super Champ XD (like the Vibro Champ XD) is a hybrid (tube circuitry complemented with digital modeling and effects).  Aside from one dual-triode 12AX7 and two 6V6 output tubes, it also has a [[digital signal processor]] (DSP) which models 16 different amplifiers and programs the volume, gain, and tone controls accordingly.

It has two channels, channel 1 being a clean channel, and channel 2 having both clean and distortion voices, using modeling technology to provide 15 additional voices. Both the Bass/Treble EQ and Effects (FX) are global settings meaning they affect the sound of both channel 1 and channel 2.

There are two stages of amplification: the first stage is done by solid-state op amps and the DSP,{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} which also provide the desired voicing of the amps. It is then fed into the first triode of the 12AX7, which acts as a second stage preamp, provides the additional tube gain for both channels and acts as an interface between the solid-state circuitry and the tube circuitry. The second triode is a phase inverter, which creates mirror images of the signal to drive the output tubes. This arrangement provides the same feel of a complete tube amp while allowing multiple voicing. The DSP chip also provides effects, including reverb, delay, chorus, and tremolo. There is no spring reverb tank.

In 2012, Fender released the '''Super Champ X2''', a redesign of the XD. The X2 is designed to interface with the FUSE software used by the Fender Mustang series of modeling solid-state amplifiers, and is also available in both combo and discrete head/speaker cabinet units.

The '''Florida Solar Energy Center''' (FSEC) is a research institute of the [[University of Central Florida]], located on a 20-acre (.08&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) research complex on Florida's [[Space Coast]] at UCF's [[Cocoa, Florida|Cocoa]] satellite campus. FSEC is the largest and most active state-supported renewable energy and energy efficiency research, training, testing and certification institute in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.ucf.edu/UCFnews/index?page=article&amp;id=0024004107a42ec8a01289848d7ab003a94 |title=UCF to Help Expand 'Green' Jobs Training |date=2010-06-20 |accessdate=2010-06-20 |publisher=University of Central Florida}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[managing director|director]] of the institute is James M. Fenton, Ph.D.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fsec.ucf.edu/people/bios/Fenton.htm |title=Florida Solar Energy Center Fenton Bio |accessdate=2009-06-17 |publisher=Florida Solar Energy Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FSEC's mission is to research and develop energy technologies that enhance Florida's and the nation's economy and environment, and to educate the public, students and practitioners on the results of the research. The Center has gained national and international recognition for its wide range of research, education, training and certification activities.

==Operations==
The Center's 150-member staff includes 95 professionals with expertise in engineering, energy research, building science, energy and policy analysis, and education and training. The remainder of the staff consists of technical and administrative support personnel and university student assistants. Research at FSEC is based on field monitoring, computer simulations and controlled experiments in highly instrumented laboratories. These research efforts are developed in partnership with industry, nonprofit organizations, private sponsors and national laboratories.

==Research and grants==
In October 2009, the [[United States Department of Energy]] provided a $2.8 million grant to Solar Energy Center to help lead efforts to create and manage the newly created [[Solar Installer Instructor Training Network]].&lt;ref name="grant"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://today.ucf.edu/blog/2009/10/16/ucf-gets-28m-from-doe-for-solar-network/ |title=UCF Gets $2.8M From DOE for Solar Network |accessdate=2009-10-19 |publisher=University of Central Florida |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091019151058/http://today.ucf.edu/blog/2009/10/16/ucf-gets-28m-from-doe-for-solar-network/ |archivedate=2009-10-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; "The training network is a five-year effort intended to create a geographic blanket of training opportunities in solar installations across the United States.

{{seealso|Proglacial lake}}
[[Image:Hubbard Glacier May 20.2000.jpg|thumb|[[Hubbard Glacier]], Alaska squeezes towards Gibert Point on 20 May 2002. The glacier is close to sealing off Russell Fjord (top) from Disenchantment Bay (below).]]

A '''glacial lake outburst flood''' ('''GLOF''') is a type of [[outburst flood]] that occurs when the [[Proglacial lake|dam containing a glacial lake]] fails. An event similar to a GLOF, where a body of water contained by a glacier melts or overflows the glacier, is called a [[Jökulhlaup]]. The dam can consist of [[glacier]] ice or a [[terminal moraine]]. Failure can happen due to [[erosion]], a buildup of [[water pressure]], an [[avalanche]] of rock or heavy snow, an [[earthquake]] or [[cryoseism]], [[volcano|volcanic eruptions]] under the ice, or if a large enough portion of a glacier breaks off and massively displaces the waters in a glacial lake at its base.

==Definition==
[[Image:Hubbard Glacier July 16.2002.jpg|thumb|In this Hubbard Glacier image from 16 July 2002, the glacier has closed off Russell Fjord from Disenchantment Bay.  The waters behind the glacier rose {{convert|61|ft}} in 10 weeks, creating a short lived Russell Lake.]]
A glacial lake outburst flood is a type of [[outburst flood]] occurring when water dammed by a glacier or a [[moraine]] is released.  A water body that is dammed by the front of a glacier is called a [[marginal lake]], and a water body that is capped by the glacier is called a [[sub-glacial lake]].  When a marginal lake bursts, it may also be called a marginal lake drainage.  When a sub-glacial lake bursts, it may be called a [[jökulhlaup]].

A jökulhlaup is thus a sub-glacial outburst flood.  Jökulhlaup is an [[Iceland]]ic term that has been adopted into the English language, originally referring only to glacial outburst floods from [[Vatnajökull]], which are triggered by volcanic eruptions, but now is accepted to describe any abrupt and large release of sub-glacial water.

Glacial lake volumes vary, but may hold millions to hundreds of millions of cubic metres of water.   [[Catastrophic failure]] of the containing ice or glacial sediment can release this water over periods of minutes to days.  Peak flows as high as 15,000 cubic metres per second have been recorded in such events, suggesting that the v-shaped canyon of a normally small mountain stream could suddenly develop an extremely turbulent and fast-moving torrent some {{convert|50|m}} deep. Glacial Lake Outburst Floods are often compounded by a massive river bed erosion in the steep moraine valleys,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Osti|first1=Rabindra|last2=Egashira|first2=Shinji|title=Hydrodynamic characteristics of the Tam Pokhari Glacial Lake outburst flood in the Mt. Everest region, Nepal|journal=Hydrological Processes|date=25 August 2009|issue=23|pages=2943–2955}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a result, the flood peaks increase as they flow downstream until the river reaches, where the sediment deposits. On a downstream floodplain, it suggests a somewhat slower inundation spreading as much as {{convert|10|km}} wide.  Both scenarios are significant threats to life, property and infrastructure.

==Monitoring==
[[Image:Hubbard Glacier August 14.2002.jpg|thumb|The Hubbard Glacier is overwhelmed on 14 August 2002 in the second largest GLOF in historical times.]]

The [[United Nations]] has a series of monitoring efforts to help prevent death and destruction in regions that are likely to experience these events. The importance of this situation has magnified over the past century due to increased populations, and the increasing number of glacial lakes that have developed due to [[Retreat of glaciers since 1850|glacier retreat]]. While all countries with glaciers are susceptible to this problem, central Asia, the [[Andes]] regions of South America and those countries in Europe that have glaciers in the [[Alps]], have been identified as the regions at greatest risk.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/Pubs/chronicle/2002/issue3/0302p48_glacial_lakes_flood_threat.html UN Chronicle | Global Warming Triggers Glacial Lakes Flood Threat&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of imminent deadly GLOFs situations that have been identified worldwide. The [[Tsho Rolpa]] glacier lake is located in the Rolwaling Valley, about {{convert|110|km}} northeast of [[Kathmandu, Nepal]], at an altitude of {{convert|4580|m}}. The lake is dammed by a {{convert|150|m}} high unconsolidated terminal moraine dam. The lake is growing larger every year due to the melting and retreat of the Trakarding Glacier, and has become the largest and most dangerous glacier lake in [[Nepal]], with approximately 90 to 100&amp;nbsp;million m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (117 to 130&amp;nbsp;million yd&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) of water stored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dhm.gov.np/tsorol/background.htm |accessdate=8 March 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060507085743/http://www.dhm.gov.np/tsorol/background.htm |archivedate=7 May 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

===Iceland===
[[Image:Twisted bridge Skaftafell due to Glacial lake outburst flood.JPG|thumb|Remains of a steel bridge, close to Skaftafell, after a glacial outburst]]
The most famous are the immense [[jökulhlaup]] released from the Vatnajökull Ice Cap in Iceland.  It is not by chance that the term ''jökulhlaup'' (''jökull'' = glacier, ''hlaup'' = run (''n.'')/running&lt;ref&gt;[http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/IcelOnline/Search.TEId.html Icelandic online dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;) comes from [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], as the south of Iceland has very often been the victim of such catastrophes.  This was the case in 1996, when the volcano under the [[Grímsvötn]] lakes belonging to the [[Vatnajökull]] glacier erupted, and the river [[Skeiðará]] flooded the land in front of [[Skaftafell]], now part of [[Vatnajökull National Park]]. The [[jökulhlaup]] reached a flow rate of 50,000 cubic metres per second, and destroyed parts of the [[Hringvegur]] (Ring Road or Iceland Road #1).  The flood carried ice floes that weighed up to 5000 tons with icebergs between 100–200 tons striking the Gigjukvisl Bridge of the Ring Road (the ruins are well marked with explanatory signs today as a popular tourist stop). The tsunami released was up to {{convert|4|m}} high and {{convert|600|m|yd}} wide. The flood carried with it 185&amp;nbsp;million tons of silt.&lt;ref&gt;[Stefán  Benediktsson and Sigrún Helgadóttir, “The Skeiđarđá River in Full Flood 1996,” Skaftafell National Park: Environment and Food Agency, UST, March, 2007--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[jökulhlaup]] flow made it for several days the 2nd largest river (in terms of water flow) after the [[Amazon River|Amazon]].

After the flooding, some [[iceberg]]s {{convert|10|m|ft}} high could be seen on the banks of the river where the glacier run had left them behind (see also [[Mýrdalsjökull]]).  The peak water release from a lake that develops around the Grímsvötn Volcanic Crater in the center of the Vatnajökull ice cap generates flows that exceed the volume of the [[Mississippi River]].  The outbursts have occurred in 1954, 1960, 1965, 1972, 1976, 1982, 1983, 1986, 1991 and 1996.  In 1996, the eruption melted {{convert|3|km3|cumi}} of ice and yielded an outburst of {{convert|6000|m3|cuyd}} per second at peak flow.

===Alaska===
During the late [[Quaternary]], ancient [[Lake Atna]] in the [[Copper River (Alaska)|Copper River Basin]] may have generated a number of glacial outburst floods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Wiedmer|first = Michael|last2 = Montgomery|first2 = David R.|last3 = Gillespie|first3 = Alan R.|last4 = Greenberg|first4 = Harvey|publication-date = 2010|title = Late Quaternary megafloods from Glacial Lake Atna, Southcentral Alaska, U.S.A.|journal = Quaternary Research|volume = 73|issue = 3|publisher = Elsevier Inc.|pages = 413–424|doi = 10.1016/j.yqres.2010.02.005| url = http://gis.ess.washington.edu/grg/publications/pdfs/Wiedmer_etal_2010.pdf|accessdate  = 19 January 2017|format = PDF|bibcode = 2010QuRes..73..413W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some jökulhlaups release annually. Lake George near the Knik River had large annual outbreaks from 1918 to 1966. Since 1966 the Knik Glacier has retreated and an ice-dam is no longer created. Lake George might resume annual floods if the glacier thickens again and blocks the valley (Post and Mayo, 1971).

Almost every year, GLOFs occur in two locations in southeastern Alaska, one of which is [[Abyss Lake (Alaska)|Abyss Lake]]. The releases associated with the Tulsequah Glacier near [[Juneau, Alaska|Juneau]] often inundate a nearby airstrip. About 40 cabins could potentially be affected and a few have been damaged by the larger floods.  Events from Salmon Glacier near [[Hyder, Alaska|Hyder]] have damaged roads near the Salmon River.&lt;ref&gt;Aimee Devaris. [http://pajk.arh.noaa.gov/info/articles/jokulhlaups/jokul.htm Southeast Alaska Jökulhlaups.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061212154136/http://pajk.arh.noaa.gov/info/articles/jokulhlaups/jokul.htm |date=12 December 2006 }} Retrieved on 2006-12-03.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contiguous United States===
Immense prehistoric GLOFs, known as the [[Missoula Floods]] or [[Spokane Floods]], occurred in North America's [[Columbia River]] watershed toward the end of the last ice age.  They were the result of periodic breaches of ice dams in present-day [[Montana]], resulting in the draining of a body of water now known as [[Glacial Lake Missoula]]. The immense floods scoured the [[Columbia Plateau]] as the water raced toward the ocean, resulting in the [[Channeled Scablands]] topography that exists today across Central and [[Eastern Washington]].

[[Glacial River Warren]] drained [[Glacial Lake Agassiz]] during the [[Wisconsinian glaciation]]; the now mild [[Minnesota River]] flows through its bed. This river seasonally drained glacial meltwater into what is now the [[Upper Mississippi River]]. The region now termed the [[Driftless Area]] of North America was contemporaneously also subject to glacial outburst floods from [[Glacial Lake Grantsburg]], and [[Glacial Lake Duluth]] during all three phases of the last [[ice age]].

Between 6 and 10 September 2003, a GLOF occurred from [[Grasshopper Glacier (Wyoming)|Grasshopper Glacier]] in the [[Wind River Mountains]], [[Wyoming]]. A [[proglacial lake]] at the head of the glacier burst through a glacial dam, and water from the lake carved a trench down the center of the glacier for more than {{convert|0.8|km|mi|1}}. An estimated {{convert|2460000|m3|usgal|-6}} of water were released in four days, raising the flow level of Dinwoody Creek from {{convert|5.66|m3|cuft|}} per second to {{convert|25.4|m3|cuft|}}  per second, as recorded at a gauging station {{convert|27|km|mi|}}  downstream. Debris from the flood was deposited more than {{convert|32|km|mi|}} along the creek. The GLOF has been attributed to the rapid retreat of the glacier, which has been ongoing since the glacier was first accurately measured in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="flood"&gt;{{cite news| last =Thuermer| first =Angus| title =The day the Grasshopper burped| work =| pages =| language =| publisher =Jackson Hole News and Guide| year =2004| url =http://www.jhnews.com/Archives/Environmental/031105-enviro.html| accessdate =2007-10-31| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://archive.is/20130103102412/http://www.jhnews.com/Archives/Environmental/031105-enviro.html| archivedate =3 January 2013| df =dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Oswald"&gt;{{cite web | last = Oswald | first = Liz | authorlink =  | author2 = Ellen Wohl | year = 2007 | url = http://stream.fs.fed.us/afsc/pdfs/Oswald.pdf | title = Jökulhlaup in the Wind River Mountains, Shoshone National Forest, Wyoming | work = Advancing the Fundamental Sciences: A Selection of Presentations for Forest Service Earth Scientists | publisher = U.S. Forest Service | accessdate = 2009-12-17 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110616081806/http://stream.fs.fed.us/afsc/pdfs/Oswald.pdf | archivedate = 16 June 2011 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Peru ===

A flood caused by a glacial lake outburst flood on December 13, 1941 killed an estimated 1,800 people along its path in Peru, including many in the town of [[Huarez]]. The cause was a block of ice that fell from a glacier in the [[Cordillera Blanca]] mountains into [[Lake Palcacocha]]. This event has been described &lt;ref&gt;Mark Carey and Holly Moulton, ''Adapting to Climate Hazards in the Peruvian Andes'', Current History (February 2018).&lt;/ref&gt; as a historic inspiration for research into glacial lake outburst floods. Numerous Peruvian geologists and engineers created techniques for avoiding such floods and exported the techniques worldwide.

===Canada===
In 1978, debris flows triggered by a jökulhlaup from [[Cathedral Glacier]] destroyed part of the [[Canadian Pacific]] railway track, derailed a freight train and buried parts of the [[Trans Canada Highway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.ec.gc.ca/eau-water/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=B7B62836-1| title=Kicking Horse Pass – 1978|work=Flooding events in Canada – British Columbia|author=Environment Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, a jökulhlaup occurred at [[Farrow Creek, British Columbia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Clague |first=J.J. |author2=Evans, S.G. |year=1997 |title=The 1994 jökulhlaup at Farrow Creek, British Columbia, Canada |journal=Geomorphology |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=77–87 |doi=10.1016/S0169-555X(96)00052-9 |bibcode = 1997Geomo..19...77C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, a jökulhlaup drained into Lake Tuborg on Ellesmere Island, and the events and its aftermath were monitored. The ice-dammed lake drained catastrophically by floating its ice dam. This is an extremely rare occurrence in the Canadian High Arctic, where most glaciers are cold based, and ice-dammed lakes typically drain slowly by overtopping their dams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lewis |first=T. |author2=Francus, P. |author3=Bradley, R.S.  |year=2007 |title=Limnology, sedimentology, and hydrology of a jökulhlaup into a meromictic high arctic lake |journal=Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences |volume=44 |issue=6 |pages=791–806 |url=http://www.geo.umass.edu/grads/lewist/#Publications
|doi=10.1139/E06-125 |bibcode = 2007CaJES..44..791L }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |last=Johnson  |first=R.G. |author2=S.-E. Lauritzen  |year=1995 |title= Hudson Bay-Hudson Strait jökulhlaups and Heinrich events: a hypothesis |journal=Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology |volume=117 |issue=1 |pages=123–137 |doi=10.1016/0031-0182(94)00120-W |bibcode=1995PPP...117..123J }}&lt;/ref&gt; that the [[Heinrich events]] during the last [[glaciation]] could have been caused by gigantic jökulhlaups from a [[Hudson Bay]] lake dammed by ice at the mouth of [[Hudson Strait]].

===Bhutan===
{{main|Glaciers of Bhutan}}

===England/France===
The [[Strait of Dover]] is thought to have been created around 200,000 years ago by a catastrophic GLOF caused by the breaching of the [[Weald-Artois Anticline]], which acted as a natural dam that held back a large lake in the [[Doggerland]] region, now submerged under the [[North Sea]]. The flood would have lasted several months, releasing as much as one million cubic metres of water per second. The cause of the breach is not known but may have been caused by an earthquake or simply the build-up of water pressure in the lake. As well as destroying the isthmus that connected Britain to continental Europe, the flood carved a large bedrock-floored valley down the length of the English Channel, leaving behind streamlined islands and longitudinal erosional grooves characteristic of catastrophic [[megaflood]] events.&lt;ref&gt;"Catastrophic flooding origin of shelf valley systems in the English Channel".

===Nepal===

Even though GLOF events have been occurring in Nepal for many decades, the Dig Cho glacial lake outburst, which took place in 1985, has triggered detailed study of this phenomenon. In 1996, the Water and Energy Commission Secretariat (WECS) of Nepal reported that five lakes were potentially dangerous, namely, Dig Tsho, [[Imja Tsho, Nepal|Imja]], Lower Barun, Tsho Rolpa, and Thulagi, all lying above 4100 m. A recent study done by [http://www.icimod.org ICIMOD] and UNEP (UNEP, 2001) reported 20 potentially dangerous lakes in Nepal. In ten of them GLOF events have occurred in the past few years and some have been regenerating after the event.  Additional dangerous glacial lakes may exist in parts of Tibet that are drained by streams crossing into Nepal, raising the possibility of outburst incidents in Tibet causing downstream damage in Nepal. The [[Gandaki River]] basin is reported to contain 1025 glaciers and 338 lakes.

'''Thulagi glacier'''
The Thulagi glacier, which is located in the Upper Marsyangdi River basin, is one out of the two moraine-dammed lakes (supra-glacial lakes), identified as a potentially dangerous lake. The [[Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau|KfW]], [[Frankfurt am Main|Frankfurt]], the BGR (Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources, Germany), in cooperation with the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology in Kathmandu, have carried out studies on the Thulagi Glacier and have concluded that even assuming the worst case, a disastrous outburst of the lake can be excluded in the near future.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bgr.de/lebgeo/thulagi.htm BGR/NLfB/GGA: Gletschersee Thulagi&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718202501/http://www.bgr.de/lebgeo/thulagi.htm |date=18 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pakistan ===
In 1929, a GLOF from the Chong Khumdan Glacier in the [[Karakoram]] caused flooding on the [[Indus River]] 1,200&amp;nbsp;km downstream (a maximum flood rise of 8.1 m at [[Attock]]).&lt;ref name=hewitt&gt;[http://www.itia.ntua.gr/hsj/redbooks/138/iahs_138_0259.pdf Hewitt, K. (1982) ''Natural dams and outburst floods of the Karakoram Himalaya''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721082835/http://itia.ntua.gr/hsj/redbooks/138/iahs_138_0259.pdf |date=21 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tibet===
Longbasaba and Pida lakes are two moraine-dammed lakes at an altitude of about 5700 m in the Eastern Himalayas.  Due to the rise of temperature, the areas of the Longbasaba and Kaer glaciers decreased by 8.7% and 16.6% from 1978 to 2005. Water from glaciers directly flowed into Longbasaba and Pida lakes, and the area of the two lakes increased by 140% and 194%.  According to the report of the Hydrological Department of  Tibet in 2006, if a GLOF had occurred at the two lakes, 23 towns and villages, where more than 12,500 people live, would have been endangered.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, Xin et al. [http://www.bioone.org/doi/pdf/10.1659/mrd.0894 “Assessment and Simulation of Glacier Lake Outburst Floods for Longbasaba and Pida Lakes, China”] Mountain Research and Development  28.3: 310–17. 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In Tibet, one of the major barley producing areas of the Tibetan Plateau was destroyed by GLOFs in August 2000.  More than 10,000 homes, 98 bridges and dykes were destroyed and its estimated cost was about $75&amp;nbsp;million.  The farming communities faced food shortages that year by losing their grain and livestock.&lt;ref&gt;WWF Nepal Program.

A major GLOF was reported in 1978 in the valley of the [[Shaksgam River]] in the Karakoram, a part of historic Kashmir, ceded by Pakistan to China.&lt;ref name=hewitt/&gt;

===Swiss Alps===
The 1818 [[Giétro Glacier#Glacier catastrophes|Giétro Glacier catastrophe]], killing 44 people, originated in a 4-km long valley located in south-western Switzerland. Fatal flooding was known during historical times&lt;ref name = Zryd&gt;{{citation|last=Zryd|first=Amédée|title= Les glaciers en mouvement|pages=52, 53, 54, 55, 68|publisher=[[Presses polytechniques et universitaires romandes]]|year=2008| isbn=978-2-88074-770-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; with 140 deaths first recorded in 1595. After an increase of the glacier during the "[[Year Without a Summer]]", an ice cone started to form&lt;ref name = Zryd/&gt; from the accumulation of falling seracs. During 1816, the valley filled into a lake which emptied during the spring of 1817. In spring of 1818, the lake measured about 2&amp;nbsp;km in length. To stop the rapid rise of waters, the canton engineer [[Ignaz Venetz]] decided to drill a sluice hole through the ice, tunneling from both upstream and downstream sides of the ice dam at an elevation of about 20 metres above the lake surface. An avalanche interrupted work, so a secondary tunnel was then drilled for safety reasons as the waters rose to 10 metres below.&lt;ref name = Zryd/&gt; Dangerous sloughing of ice delayed the work until finally a 198-metre-long hole was completed on 4 June,&lt;ref name = Zryd/&gt; days before lake began to escape via the manmade waterfall on 13 June. Venetz warned the inhabitants of the valley of the danger as water was also escaping from the base of the cone.&lt;ref name = Zryd/&gt; However, the cone began to crack on the morning of 16 June and at 16:30 the ice dam broke sending 18 million m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of flood waters into the valley below.&lt;ref name = Zryd/&gt;

{{Standard model of particle physics}}
A '''gluon''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|l|uː|ɒ|n}}) is an [[elementary particle]] that acts as the exchange particle (or [[gauge boson]]) for the [[strong interaction|strong force]] between [[quark]]s. It is analogous to the exchange of [[photon]]s in the [[electromagnetic force]] between two [[charged particle]]s.&lt;ref name=HyperPhysics&gt;{{cite web
 |author=C.R. Nave
 |title=The Color Force
 |url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/forces/color.html
 |work=[[HyperPhysics]]
 |publisher=[[Georgia State University]], Department of Physics
 |accessdate=2012-04-02
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In layman's terms, they "glue" quarks together, forming [[hadron]]s such as [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s.

In technical terms, gluons are [[Vector boson|vector]] [[gauge boson]]s that mediate [[strong interaction]]s of [[quark]]s in [[quantum chromodynamics]] (QCD). Gluons themselves carry the [[color charge]] of the strong interaction. This is unlike the [[photon]], which mediates the [[Electromagnetic force|electromagnetic interaction]] but lacks an electric charge. Gluons therefore participate in the strong interaction in addition to mediating it, making QCD significantly harder to analyze than QED ([[quantum electrodynamics]]).

==Properties==
The gluon is a [[vector boson]]; like the [[photon]], it has a [[spin (physics)|spin]] of 1. While massive spin-1 particles have three polarization states, massless gauge bosons like the gluon have only two polarization states because [[gauge invariance]] requires the polarization to be [[transverse wave|transverse]]. In [[quantum field theory]], unbroken gauge invariance requires that gauge bosons have zero mass (experiments limit the gluon's rest mass to less than a few meV/c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). The gluon has negative intrinsic [[parity (physics)|parity]].

==Counting gluons==
Unlike the single [[photon]] of QED or the three [[W and Z bosons]] of the [[weak interaction]], there are eight independent types of gluon in QCD.

This may be difficult to understand intuitively. [[Quark]]s carry three types of [[color charge]]; antiquarks carry three types of anticolor. Gluons may be thought of as carrying both color and anticolor. This gives nine ''possible'' combinations of color and anticolor in gluons. The following is a list of those combinations (and their schematic names):

* red-antired (&lt;math&gt;r\bar{r}&lt;/math&gt;), red-antigreen (&lt;math&gt;r\bar{g}&lt;/math&gt;), red-antiblue (&lt;math&gt;r\bar{b}&lt;/math&gt;)
* green-antired (&lt;math&gt;g\bar{r}&lt;/math&gt;), green-antigreen (&lt;math&gt;g\bar{g}&lt;/math&gt;), green-antiblue (&lt;math&gt;g\bar{b}&lt;/math&gt;)
* blue-antired, (&lt;math&gt;b\bar{r}&lt;/math&gt;), blue-antigreen (&lt;math&gt;b\bar{g}&lt;/math&gt;), blue-antiblue (&lt;math&gt;b\bar{b}&lt;/math&gt;)

[[File:Feynman Diagram Y-3g.svg|thumb|240px|right|Diagram 2: e&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;rarr; Υ(9.46) &amp;rarr; 3g]]
These are not the ''actual''  color states of observed gluons, but rather ''effective'' states. To correctly understand how they are combined, it is necessary to consider the mathematics of color charge in more detail.

===Color charge and superposition===
In [[quantum mechanics]], the states of particles may be added according to the [[quantum superposition|principle of superposition]]; that is, they may be in a "combined state" with a ''probability'', if some particular quantity is measured, of giving several different outcomes. A relevant illustration in the case at hand would be a gluon with a color state described by:

:&lt;math&gt;(r\bar{b}+b\bar{r})/\sqrt{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

This is read as "red–antiblue plus blue–antired". (The factor of the square root of two is required for [[normalisable wave function|normalization]], a detail that is not crucial to understand in this discussion.) If one were somehow able to make a direct measurement of the color of a gluon in this state, there would be a 50% chance of it having red-antiblue color charge and a 50% chance of blue-antired color charge.

===Color singlet states===
It is often said that the stable strongly interacting particles (such as the proton and the neutron, i.e. [[hadrons]]) observed in nature are "colorless", but more precisely they are in a "color singlet" state, which is mathematically analogous to a [[singlet state|''spin'' singlet state]].&lt;ref name="Griff"&gt;
{{cite book
 |author=David Griffiths
 |year=1987
 |title=Introduction to Elementary Particles
 |pages=280–281
 |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]
 |isbn=978-0-471-60386-3
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such states allow interaction with other color singlets, but not with other color states; because long-range gluon interactions do not exist, this illustrates that gluons in the singlet state do not exist either.&lt;ref name="Griff"/&gt;

The color singlet state is:&lt;ref name="Griff"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;(r\bar{r}+b\bar{b}+g\bar{g})/\sqrt{3}.&lt;/math&gt;

In words, if one could measure the color of the state, there would be equal probabilities of it being red-antired, blue-antiblue, or green-antigreen.

===Eight gluon colors===
&lt;!-- the link "eight gluon types" from the article "Quark" links here --&gt;
There are eight remaining independent color states, which correspond to the "eight types" or "eight colors" of gluons. Because states can be mixed together as discussed above, there are many ways of presenting these states, which are known as the "color octet". One commonly used list is:&lt;ref name="Griff"/&gt;

{| style="margin:auto;"
|-
|&lt;math&gt;(r\bar{b}+b\bar{r})/\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
|&lt;math&gt;-i(r\bar{b}-b\bar{r})/\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;(r\bar{g}+g\bar{r})/\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;
|
|&lt;math&gt;-i(r\bar{g}-g\bar{r})/\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;(b\bar{g}+g\bar{b})/\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;
|
|&lt;math&gt;-i(b\bar{g}-g\bar{b})/\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;(r\bar{r}-b\bar{b})/\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;
|

These are equivalent to the [[Gell-Mann matrices]]. The critical feature of these particular eight states is that they are [[linearly independent]], and also independent of the singlet state, hence 3&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 or 2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. There is no way to add any combination of these states to produce any other, and it is also impossible to add them to make r{{overline|r}}, g{{overline|g}}, or b{{overline|b}}&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; the forbidden [[singlet state]]. There are many other possible choices, but all are mathematically equivalent, at least equally complicated, and give the same physical results.

===Group theory details===
Technically, QCD is a [[gauge theory]] with [[SU(3)]] gauge symmetry. Quarks are introduced as [[spinor]]s in ''N''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; [[flavour (particle physics)|flavor]]s, each in the [[fundamental representation]] (triplet, denoted '''3''') of the color gauge group, SU(3). The gluons are vectors in the [[Adjoint representation of a Lie group|adjoint representation]] (octets, denoted '''8''') of color SU(3). For a general [[lie group|gauge group]], the number of force-carriers (like photons or gluons) is always equal to the dimension of the adjoint representation. For the simple case of SU(''N''), the dimension of this representation is {{nowrap|''N''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}}.

In terms of group theory, the assertion that there are no color singlet gluons is simply the statement that [[quantum chromodynamics]] has an SU(3) rather than a [[U(N)|U(3)]] symmetry. There is no known [[A priori and a posteriori|''a priori'']] reason for one group to be preferred over the other, but as discussed above, the experimental evidence supports SU(3).&lt;ref name="Griff"/&gt; The U(1) group for electromagnetic field combines with a slightly more complicated group known as SU(2) – S stands for "special" – which means the corresponding matrices have determinant 1 in addition to being unitary.

==Confinement==
{{main|Color confinement}}
Since gluons themselves carry color charge, they participate in strong interactions. These gluon-gluon interactions constrain color fields to string-like objects called "[[QCD string|flux tube]]s", which exert constant force when stretched. Due to this force, [[quark]]s are [[color confinement|confined]] within [[composite particle]]s called [[hadron]]s. This effectively limits the range of the strong interaction to {{val|1|e=-15}} meters, roughly the size of an [[atomic nucleus]]. Beyond a certain distance, the energy of the flux tube binding two quarks increases linearly. At a large enough distance, it becomes energetically more favorable to pull a quark-antiquark pair out of the vacuum rather than increase the length of the flux tube.

Gluons also share this property of being confined within hadrons. One consequence is that gluons are not directly involved in the [[nuclear force]]s between hadrons. The force mediators for these are other hadrons called [[meson]]s.

Although in the [[normal phase of QCD]] single gluons may not travel freely, it is predicted that there exist hadrons that are formed entirely of gluons — called [[glueball]]s. There are also conjectures about other [[exotic hadron]]s in which real gluons (as opposed to [[virtual particle|virtual]] ones found in ordinary hadrons) would be primary constituents. Beyond the normal phase of QCD (at extreme temperatures and pressures), [[quark–gluon plasma]] forms. In such a plasma there are no hadrons; quarks and gluons become free particles.

==Experimental observations==
[[Quark]]s and gluons (colored) manifest themselves by fragmenting into more quarks and gluons, which in turn hadronize into normal (colorless) particles, correlated in jets. As shown in 1978 summer conferences,&lt;ref name="SMY"/&gt; the [[PLUTO detector]] at the electron-positron collider DORIS ([[DESY]]) produced the first evidence that the hadronic decays of the very narrow resonance Υ(9.46) could be interpreted as [[three-jet event]] topologies produced by three gluons. Later, published analyses by the same experiment confirmed this interpretation and also the spin 1 nature of the gluon&lt;ref&gt;

[[Color confinement]] is verified by the failure of [[free quark]] searches (searches of fractional charges). Quarks are normally produced in pairs (quark + antiquark) to compensate the quantum color and flavor numbers; however at [[Fermilab]] single production of [[top quark]]s has been shown (technically this still involves a pair production, but quark and antiquark are of different flavor).&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8250">The '''hobbit''' (also '''hobbett''', '''hobbet''', or '''hobed''', from {{lang-cy|hobaid}}) is a unit of volume or weight formerly used in [[Wales]] for trade in grain and other staples.  It was equal to four [[peck]]s or two and a half [[bushel]]s, but was also often used as a unit of weight, which varied depending on the material being measured.  The hobbit remained in customary use in markets in northern Wales after Parliament standardized the [[Winchester measure|Winchester]] bushel as the unit of measure for grain, after which courts gave inconsistent rulings as to its legal status.

==Usage==
The hobbit was defined as a measure of volume, two and a half imperial [[bushel]]s, but in practice it was often used as a unit of weight for specific goods.&lt;ref name="oldcountry"&gt;{{cite book|title=Old Country and Farming Words|last=Britten|first=James|year=1880|publisher=Trübner &amp; Co.|page=171|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2VAJAAAAQAAJ|accessdate=2009-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to George Richard Everitt, Inspector of Corn Returns for [[Denbigh]] in northern [[Wales]], when examined by the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] in 1888, grains were sold by the hobbit, measured by weight.  A hobbit of [[oats]] weighed 105 [[pound (mass)|pound]]s, a hobbit of [[barley]] 147 pounds, and a hobbit of [[wheat]] 168 pounds.  The figures in hobbits were then converted to standard imperial bushels for official reporting.&lt;ref name="parl"&gt;{{cite book|title=Corn averages; county courts consolidation; debates and proceedings in parliament|volume=3|series=Reports from Committees|author=House of Commons|year=1888|publisher=HMSO|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LHQTAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=2009-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition to grains, there was also a hobbit of [[bean]]s at 180 pounds,&lt;ref name="oldcountry" /&gt; and in [[Flintshire]], a 200-pound hobbit of old potatoes, or
210 pounds of new potatoes.&lt;ref name="columbus"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Proceedings of the Columbus Horticultural Society|title=British local weights and measures|volume=XI|issue=2, 3|date=June–September 1896|editor-last=Hine|editor-first=J.S.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f6U1AAAAIAAJ|accessdate=2009-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Around 1600, Welsh farmland was sometimes denominated by its productive capacity or ''measure of seedness'' instead of its physical area, so that in at least one case a plot was registered as
"a hobbett of land", that is, large enough to grow one hobbit of grain per year.&lt;ref name="land_tenure"&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Ancient Tenures of Land in North Wales and the Marches|last1=Palmer|first1=Alfred Neobard|last2=Owen|first2=Edward|year=1910|url=http://socserv.mcmaster.ca/econ/ugcm/3ll3/palmer/AncientTenuresNorthWales.pdf|accessdate=2009-01-12|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Already in 1863, the hobbit was used as an example of the "customary confusion in our British weights and measures".  An anonymous contributor to  [[Charles Dickens]]'s journal [[All the Year Round]], arguing in favour of the decimal [[metric system]],
noted that&lt;ref name="allyear"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=All the Year Round|editor-last=Dickens|editor-first=Charles|author=Unknown|title=At your fingers' ends|date=May 2, 1863|volume=IX|issue=210|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RdUNAAAAQAAJ|accessdate=2009-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
If [I buy wheat] at [[Wrexham]], [I must order] by the hobbet of one hundred and sixty eight [pounds].  But, even if I do happen to know what a hobbet of wheat means at Wrexham, that knowledge good for Flint is not good for [[Caernarvonshire]]. A hobbet of wheat at [[Pwllheli|Pwlheli]] contains eighty-four pounds more than a hobbet at Wrexham; and a hobbet of oats is something altogether different; and a hobbet of barley is something altogether different again.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;!-- ## Seems to be quite wrong, given testimony that the hobbit was still in regular use in Denbigh in 1888
By 1878, although the hobbit was still in use in Denbigh, it was noted as a measure "less known, and soon to be forgotten" with the passage of the
[[Weights and Measures Act]] of 1878.&lt;ref name="notes_queries"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Notes and Queries, Fifth Series|volume=10|page=345|year=1878|author=F. S.|title=Names of weights and measures|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p2IEAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=2009-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
--&gt;

==Legal issues==
There was some dispute about the legality of the hobbit as a non-standard measure in commerce after Parliament established the [[Winchester measure]].  The hobbit's mixed use as a unit of both volume and of weight complicated the issue, as laws applied to the two cases differently.  Courts sometimes nullified grain contracts denominated in hobbits, and sometimes upheld them, according to varying customs in precisely how hobbits were defined and measured.

In 1825, the [[Exchequer of Pleas]] heard the case of ''Tyson v. Thomas'', regarding an unfulfilled 1823 contract for the delivery of 20 hobbits of barley in [[Llanrwst]], at 10 [[shilling (United Kingdom)|shilling]]s each.  The price of barley subsequently increased, and the seller did not make delivery.  The buyer sued, and the defendant argued that the contract was illegal because it was not based on the standard Winchester bushel. According to testimony, the Llanrwst market used a half-hobbit measure of two 21-[[quart]] [[peck]]s, but in practice a hobbit could vary from 80 to 84 quarts.  The court agreed with the seller, finding that the hobbit was impermissible because it was not a fixed integer multiple of the bushel.
The contract was therefore void.&lt;ref name="exchequer"&gt;{{cite book|title=Reports of Cases Argued and Determined in the Courts of Exchequer and Exchequer Chamber: At Law, in Equity, and in Error, from Hilary Term, 5 &amp; 6 Geo. IV., to Michaelmas Term, 6 Geo. IV., Both Inclusive|year=1827|page=119|publisher=S.

Denton'', concerning a sale of [[malt]], but the court held that the question of measures had no effect on the case because the account had
already been settled.&lt;ref name="revised_reports"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Revised Reports: Being a Republication of Such Cases in the English Courts of Common Law and Equity, from the Year 1785, as are Still of Practical Utility|volume=XL, 1834-1836|year=1899|publisher=Sweet and Maxwell|editor1-last=Pollock|editor1-first=Frederick|page=692|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KdwwAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=2009-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1852 case ''Hughes v. Humphreys'' concerned a contract for the sale of 100 hobbits of wheat at 18 shillings per hobbit.  Following custom, the grain was actually delivered in sacks weighed out to 252 pounds each, and converted to 168-pound hobbits.  The seller sued to obtain payment from the buyer, who argued that the contract was unenforceable because the hobbit was a non-standard and illegal measure of volume, contrary to Parliamentary establishment of the Winchester bushel for trade in grain.  The magistrate at the local [[assizes]] in [[Flintshire]], J. Williams, found for the defendant, voiding the contract.  This ruling was reversed by the [[Court of Queen's Bench]], which reasoned that the in distinction to the ''Tyson'' case, the hobbit in this instance was used as a measure of weight, not volume, and was defined as a fixed multiple of the pound.  Because the sale of grain in pounds was allowed, the contract was deemed valid and was enforced.&lt;ref name="law-journal"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Law Journal for the Year 1854: Comprising Reports of Cases in the Courts of Chancery, King's Bench, Common Pleas, Exchequer of Pleas, and Exchequer of Chamber|year=1854|page=356|publisher=E.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3044">The '''Horton sphere''' is a spherical [[pressure vessel]], which is used for storage of compressed gases such as [[propane]], [[Liquefied petroleum gas]]  or [[butane]] in a [[liquid gas]] stage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbi.com/markets/upstream-oil-gas/storage-tanks-vessels/hortonsphere-pressure-vessels Hortonsphere® Pressure Vessels, CB&amp;I]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

'Horton sphere' or 'Hortonsphere' is named after [[Horace Ebenezer Horton]] (1843-1912), founder and financier of a bridge design and construction firm in about 1860, merged to form the [[Chicago Bridge &amp; Iron Company]] (CBI) in 1889 as a bridge building firm and constructed the first bulk liquid storage tanks in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. CBI built the first field-erected spherical pressure vessels in the world at the [[Port Arthur, Texas]] refinery in 1923,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbi.com/about-cbi/history CB&amp;I History 1920-1949]&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently claimed 'Hortonsphere' as a registered trademark.&lt;ref&gt;[http://trademarks.justia.com/711/98/hortonsphere-71198114.html Justia Trademark Details Justia.com]&lt;/ref&gt; A patent was lodged on Sept 23, 1947, to address the problem of damage to the supports caused by heat expansion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents/US2427676 US Patents, George T. HORTON 2,427,676]&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of their distinctive form, some have become subject to conservation campaigns such as that at [[Poughkeepsie]] NY.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hudsonvalleyruins.org/rob/?p=1589 Central Hudson Gas and Electric Horton Sphere, Poughkeepsie]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction and use==

[[Image:MiRO4.jpg|thumb|300px|Hortonspheres at [[Karlsruhe]] MiRO  [[petroleum refinery]]]]

Initially, Hortonspheres were constructed by riveting together separate wrought iron or steel plates, but from the 1940s, were of welded construction. The plates are formed in roller plants and cut to patterns.

CBI accounts for a large  proportion of spherical pressure vessels in the world. They are used extensively for LPG, as well as for other volatile gasses. CBI identifies the following uses: gasoline, anhydrous ammonia, vinyl chloride monomer (VCM), naphtha, propane, propylene, ethane, butane, NGL and butadien. [[Cryogenic storage]] is also possible for LNG, methane, ethylene, hydrogen, and oxygen. Gases that may be stored include hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, helium and argon. Other uses have been applied to the Hortonsphere including space chambers, hyperbaric chambers, environmental chambers, vacuum vessels, process vessels, test vessels, containment vessels and surge vessels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalrefining.com/data/literature/file/1379291933.pdf CBI Hortonsphere® Pressure Vessels]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hy-Rib''' was a brand name for a product manufactured by the [[Trussed Concrete Steel Company]]. It is an engineering reinforcement system for floors, walls, and ceilings of buildings and houses. This product is a derivative of the [[Kahn System|Kahn Trussed Bar]] for beams and columns that was invented by [[Julius Kahn (inventor)|Julius Kahn]]. Kahn engineered the Hy-Rib products and they were first manufactured in 1909.&lt;ref name="SedlarReport"&gt; {{cite journal | url=http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/98436/Sedlar_Engineering_Industrial_Architecture.pdf | title=Engineering Industrial Architecture: Albert Kahn and the Trussed Concrete Steel Company | publisher=University of Michigan | date=June 24, 2013 | author=Sedlar, Frank | journal=2012–2013 MLibrary Undergraduate Research Award Maize Award for Single-Term Projects | format=PDF | ref={{sfnRef|Sedlar|2013}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hy-Rib is a steel [[encasement]] stiffened by rigid ribs used in reinforced walls, ceilings, and floors.{{sfn|Truscon|1917|p=5}} They are [[Helix|helical]] hooping units of steel sheathing forms used in concrete, stucco and plaster.{{sfn|Skinner|1997|p=13}} Hy-Rib products are a derivative of the "wings" used in the patented Kahn System of reinforced concrete, invented by Julius Kahn in 1903.{{sfn|Hughes|Allen|Hecht|2001|p=142}} The products are made from a single plate of steel.{{sfn|Truscon|1917|p=5}} Hy-Rib products were used in concrete doors, ceilings, and roofs.{{sfn|Truscon|1917|p=5}} It was also used in sidings, partitions and ceilings to eliminate channels.{{sfn|Truscon|1917|p=5}} Hy-Rib products were designed to take on plaster and cement to eliminate layout forms in the construction of buildings.{{sfn|Truscon|1917|p=5}} The steel sheet form would be embedded with plaster or cement directly and would flow into the lath surface to attach itself to the steel and harden to secure the material into the steel.&lt;ref name="SedlarReport"/&gt;

== Description and Application ==
Hy-Rib products came in steel sheathing forms that could be bent, cut and connected together to make various size floors, walls, and ceilings. They were designed with the idea to reduce weight as compared to wood structures of the same building size. The steel forms of sheathing were stiffened by rigid high ribs and a complete unit was made with a single sheet of steel. This technique increased floor space because it cut down on center posts that were normally used in wood structured buildings. The Hy-Rib reinforced concrete floors, ceilings and walls were fireproof, being a major safety factor over wooden structures. The [[Packard Automotive Plant|Packard automobile factory plant building number 10]] is a demonstration of Hy-Rib product application of this reinforced concrete technique.&lt;ref name=SedlarReport/&gt;{{sfn|Hildebrand|1974|pp=28–30}}  This was the first time reinforced concrete products were used for automobile factory construction.{{sfn|Hildebrand|1974|p=31|ps=. "Thus Plant Number Ten represented a clear advance in factory construction for Packard and for the automobile industry in general, as it was the first automobile plant to be built of reinforced concrete."}}{{sfn|Sedlar|2013|p=31|ps=. "The Packard #10 building was the first to utilize reinforced concrete with Julius Kahn's Kahn Bar but also as previously discussed, the full range of steel building products from the Trussed Concrete Steel Company."}}

Hy-Rib products are used in the construction of [[tunnels]], [[Pipe (fluid conveyance)|conduits]], [[flume]]s, [[culvert]]s, [[silo]]s, [[cistern]]s, [[chimney]]s, and [[water tank]]s. For these applications the lath sheet products come in curved steel sheets. They are locked together to form a complete tube or tunnel on site. The curved sheets are stood on edge in the case of silos, water tanks, cisterns, and chimneys. The connected form then is plastered with cement. In some cases a few steel rods are added for extra strength and connecting purposes.{{sfn|Truscon|1917|pp=119–130}}

Hy-Rib products are used in flooring due to its ability to interlock prefabricated pieces. It has plaster applied to the underside creating the ceiling. The top would have wet cement poured on it to form the floor above. If the floor were required to carry heavy loads the Hy-Rib sheathing material could be bent into an arch to provide additional strength and then wet cement could poured as usual on top to make a floor.&lt;ref name=SedlarReport/&gt;

'''Hydrail''' is the generic (not capitalized) adjective term describing all forms of rail vehicles, large or small, which use on-board [[hydrogen]] as a source of [[energy]] to power the [[traction motors]], or the [[auxiliary power unit|auxiliaries]], or both. Hydrail [[vehicles]] convert the chemical energy of [[hydrogen]] to [[mechanical energy]], either by burning hydrogen in a [[hydrogen internal combustion engine vehicle]], or by reacting hydrogen with oxygen in a [[fuel cell]] to run [[electric motors]]. Widespread use of hydrogen for fueling [[rail transportation]] is a basic element of the proposed [[hydrogen economy]].

Hydrail vehicles are usually [[hybrid vehicles]] with renewable [[energy storage]], such as [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]] or [[super capacitor]]s, for [[regenerative braking]], improving efficiency and lowering the amount of hydrogen storage required. Potential hydrail applications include all types of [[rail transport]]: [[commuter rail]];  [[passenger rail]];  [[freight rail]]; [[light rail]]; rail [[rapid transit]]; [[mine railways]]; [[industrial railway]] systems; [[trams]]; and special rail rides at parks and museums.

The term hydrail was first mentioned on August 22, 2003, in an invited presentation at the US Department of Transportation’s Volpe Transportations Systems Center in Cambridge, MA. There, Stan Thompson, a former futurist and strategic planner at US telecoms company [[AT&amp;T]] gave a presentation entitled the Mooresville Hydrail Initiative.&lt;ref name = "rai tech 16"&gt;Grey, Eva. [https://www.railway-technology.com/features/featuregerman-state-thrusts-hydrogen-powered-hydrail-into-the-spotlight-4928956/ "German state thrusts hydrogen-powered hydrail into the spotlight."] ''railway-technology.com'', 21 June 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to authors Stan Thompson and Jim Bowman, the term first appeared in print on 17 February 2004 in the [[International Journal of Hydrogen Energy]] as a search engine target word to enable scholars and technicians around the world  working in the hydrogen rail area to more easily publish and locate all work produced within the discipline.&lt;ref&gt;Stan Thompson and Jim Bowman (2004) "The Mooresville Hydrail Initiative", ''[[International Journal of Hydrogen Energy]]'' '''29'''(4): 438, in "News and Views" (a non-peer-reviewed section)&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2005, annual International Hydrail Conferences have been held. Organised by [[Appalachian State University and the Mooresville South Iredell Chamber of Commerce]] in conjunction with universities and other entities, the Conferences have the aim of bringing together scientists, engineers, business leaders, industrial experts, and operators working or using the technology around the world in order to expedite deployment of the technology for environmental, climate, energy security and economic development reasons. Presenters at these conferences have included national and state/provincial agencies from the USA, Austria, Canada, China, Denmark, the EU, Germany, France, Italy, Japan, Korea, Russia, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the European Union and the United Nations (UNIDO-ICHET).{{CN|date=January 2018}} In its early years, these conferences were largely dominated by academic fields; however, by 2013, an increasing number of businesses and industrial figures have reportedly been in attendance.&lt;ref name = "rai eng 18"&gt;[https://www.railengineer.uk/2018/01/05/hydrail-comes-of-age/ "Hydrail comes of age."] ''railengineer.uk'', 5 January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2010s, both fuel cells and hydrogen generation equipment have been taken up by several transport operators across various countries, such as [[China]], [[Germany]], [[Japan]], [[Taiwan]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[United States]]. Many of the same technologies that can be applied to hydrail vehicles can be applied to other forms of transport as well, such as road vehicles.&lt;ref name = "rai eng 18"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "rai tech 16"/&gt;

==Technology==
{{see also|hydrogen|fuel cell}}
Hydrogen is a common and easy to find [[Chemical element|element]], being that [[water]] has two molecules of hydrogen for every [[oxygen]] molecule present.&lt;ref name = "rai eng 18"/&gt; Hydrogen can be separated from water via several means, including steam reforming (normally involving the use of [[fossil fuel]]s) and electrolysis (which requires large amounts of [[electricity]]). Once isolated, hydrogen can serve as a form of fuel.&lt;ref name = "rai eng 18"/&gt; It has been proposed that hydrogen for fuelling hydrail vehicles can be produced in individual maintenance depots, requiring only a steady supply of electricity and water; it can then be pumped into pressurised tanks upon the vehicle.&lt;ref name = "rai eng 18"/&gt;

The development of lighter and more capable fuel cells has increased the viability of hydrogen-powered vehicles. According to Canadian company Hydrogenics, in 2001, its 25kW fuel cell weighed 290kg and had an efficiency ranging between 38 and 45 per cent; however, by 2017, they were producing more powerful and compact fuel cells weighing 72kg and with an efficiency between 48 and 55 per cent, a roughly fivefold increase in energy density.&lt;ref name = "rai eng 18"/&gt; According to Rail Engineer, the use of hydrogen propulsion on certain types of trains, such as freight locomotives or high-speed trains, is less attractive and more challenging than on lower-powered applications, such as shunting locomotives and multiple units.&lt;ref name = "rai eng 18"/&gt; The publication also observes that pressure to cut emissions within the railway industry is likely to play a role in stimulating demand for the uptake of hydrail.&lt;ref name = "rai eng 18"/&gt;

A key technology of a typical hydrogen propulsion system is the [[fuel cell]]. This device converts the [[chemical energy]] contained within the hydrogen in order to generate electricity, as well as water and heat.&lt;ref name = "rai eng 18"/&gt; As such, a fuel cell would operate in a manner that is essentially inverse to the electrolysis process used to create the fuel; consuming pure hydrogen to produce electricity rather than consuming electrical energy to produce hydrogen, albeit incurring some level of energy losses in the exchange.&lt;ref name = "rai eng 18"/&gt; Reportedly, the efficiency of converting electricity to hydrogen and back again is just beneath 30 per cent, roughly similar to contemporary diesel engines but less than conventional electric traction using overhead catenary wires. The electricity produced by the onboard fuel cell would be fed into a [[motor]] to propel the train.&lt;ref name = "rai eng 18"/&gt;

Railway industrial publication Railway Engineer has theorised that the expanding prevalence of wind power has led to some countries having surpluses of electrical energy during nighttime hours, and that this trend could offer a means of low-cost and highly available energy with which hydrogen could be conveniently produced via electrolysis.&lt;ref name = "rai eng 18"/&gt; In this manner, it is believed that the production of hydrogen using [[Peak_demand#Off-peak|off-peak]] electricity available from countries' [[electrical grid]]s shall likely be one of the most economic practices available. As of January 2017, hydrogen produced via electrolysis commonly costs roughly the same as [[natural gas]] and almost double that of diesel fuel; however, unlike either of these fossil-based fuels, hydrogen propulsion produces zero emissions.&lt;ref name = "rai eng 18"/&gt;

According to Rail Engineer and Alstom, a 10MW wind farm is capable of comfortably producing 2.5 tonnes of hydrogen per day;  enough to power a fleet of 14 iLint trains over a distance of 600km per day.&lt;ref name = "rai eng 18"/&gt; Reportedly, as of January 2017, production of hydrogen worldwide has been expanding in quantity and availability, increasing its attractiveness as a fuel. The need to build up a capable distribution network for hydrogen, which in turn requires substantial investments to be made, is likely to play a role in restraining the growth of hydrail at least in the short term.&lt;ref name = "rai eng 18"/&gt;

It was observed by Railway Technology that the rail industry has been historically slow to adopt new technologies and relatively conservative in outlook; however, a successful large-scale deployment of this technology by an early adopter may be decisive in overcoming attitudes of reluctance and traditionalism.&lt;ref name = "rai tech 16"/&gt; Additionally, there could be significant benefits to transitioning from diesel to hydrail propulsion. According to the results of a study performed by a consortium of [[Hitachi#Hitachi_Rail|Hitachi Rail Europe]], the [[University of Birmingham]], and Fuel Cell Systems Ltd, hydrail vehicles in the form of re-powered diesel multiple units could be capable of generating significant energy consumption reductions; reportedly, their model indicated a saving of up to 52 per cent on the [[Norwich]] to [[Sheringham]] line over conventional traction.&lt;ref name = "rai eng 18"/&gt;

===Hydrolley===
A ''hydrolley'' is a term for a [[streetcar]] or tram (trolley) powered by hydrail technology. The term (for ''hydro''gen tro''lley'') was coined at the Fourth International Hydrail Conference, Valencia, Spain, in 2008, as a research-simplifying search engine target word. Onboard hydrogen-derived power eliminates the need for overhead trolley arms and track electrification, greatly reducing construction cost, reducing [[visual pollution]] and eliminating the maintenance expense of track electrification. The term 'hydrolley' is preferred to 'hydrail light rail' or other combinations which might connote external electrification.{{CN|date=January 2018}}

The '''International Federation of Building and Wood Workers''' ('''IFBWW''') was a [[global union federation]] of [[trade union]]s in the [[building industry|building]], building materials, [[wood industry|wood]], [[forestry]] and allied industries. It was established in 1934 by a merger of the [[Building Workers International]] and [[Wood Workers International]]. The [[International Secretariat of Stone Masons]], the [[International Secretariat of Painters and Allied Trades]] and the [[International Secretariat of Bricklayers]] later joined the organisation. {{As of|2005}}, it had 287 member organisations in 124 countries, representing a combined membership of more than 10 million workers.

The IFBWW was based in [[Geneva]] and had a network of regional offices. The organisation worked closely with the [[International Trade Union Confederation]] (ITUC) and the other global union federations, and had Special Consultative Status at the [[UN Economic and Social Council|Economic and Social Committee]] of the [[United Nations]].

The IFBWW held a congress every four years, consisting of delegates from the member organisations. The congress established priorities and strategy for the organisation, and elected the Executive Committee. which met immediately before and after the congress, and at the midpoint of the congress period. As supreme governing body during the intercongress period, it was responsible for all policies and operations of the IFBWW. The Executive Committee appointed a Management Committee, which was responsible for the administration of the IFBWW and for the implementation of its policies.

At its congress in Buenos Aires on 9 December 2005 the IFBWW merged with the [[World Federation of Building and Wood Workers]] (WFBW) to create a new joint global union federation, the [[Building and Wood Workers' International]].

'''Kayraktepe Dam''' is a planned hydroelectric plant of [[Turkey]].

It is at {{coord|36|30|50|N|33|31|05|E}} in [[Silifke]] [[ilçe]] (district) of [[Mersin Province]]. It is to the south of Turkish state highway {{TUR-D|715}} which connects [[Mersin]] to [[Karaman]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.haritatr.com/harita/Kayraktepe-Baraji/78497 Map page ]&lt;/ref&gt;

The dam is planned to be on [[Göksu River]]. It was planned 30 years ago. But Göksu River valley is a fertile agricultural area (olive, grapes, figs, apricot etc.) and the construction was delayed because of the environmental concerns. 
==Technical details==
Its hydraulic head will be about {{convert|90|m}} and the area of the reservoir will be {{convert|59.3|km2}} between Silifke, [[Mut, Mersin|Mut]] and [[Gülnar]] ilçes. The nominal power of the turbines will be 281.75 MWe. With this power the annual energy production is calculated to be 688 820 000 KW-hr. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enerjiatlasi.com/hidroelektrik/kayraktepe-baraji.html Energy atlas of Turkey {{tr icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''London Stone''' is a historic [[landmark]] housed at 111 [[Cannon Street]] in the [[City of London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{NHLE |num=1286846 |desc='London Stone' with stone surround and iron grille set into base of number 111, Cannon Street EC4 |grade=II* |accessdate=11 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an irregular block of [[oolitic limestone]] measuring 53 × 43 × 30&amp;nbsp;cm (21 × 17 × 12"), the remnant of a once much larger object that had stood for many centuries on the south side of the street.

The name "London Stone" was first recorded around the year 1100. The date and original purpose of the Stone are unknown, although it is possibly of Roman origin, and there has been interest and speculation about it since at least the 16th century. There are modern claims that it was formerly an object of veneration, or has some occult significance. These assertions, however, are completely unsubstantiated.

==Description==
The present London Stone is only the upper portion of a once much larger object, as described below under [[#History|History]]. The surviving portion is a block of [[oolitic limestone]] approximately 53&amp;nbsp;cm wide, 43&amp;nbsp;cm high, and 30&amp;nbsp;cm front to back (21 × 17 × 12&amp;nbsp;inches).{{sfn|Clark|2007|p=169}} A study in the 1960s indicated that the stone is [[Clipsham]] Limestone, a good-quality stone from [[Rutland]] transported to London for building purposes in both the Roman and medieval periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Merrifield |first=Ralph |authorlink= Ralph Merrifield |title=The Roman City of London |place=London |publisher=Benn |year=1965 |pages=123–4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, Kevin Hayward has suggested that it may be [[Bath stone]], the stone most used for monuments and sculpture in early Roman London and in Saxon times.{{sfn|Clark|2007|p=177}}

Between 1962 and 2016 London Stone was on the north side of [[Cannon Street]], opposite [[Cannon Street station]], in an aperture in the wall of 111 Cannon Street (London EC4N 5AR), surrounded by a decorative [[Portland stone]] fascia with an iron grille. Inside the building it was protected by a glass case. The stone and its surround, with the iron grille, were designated a Grade II* [[listed building|listed structure]] on 5 June 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{IoE|199345| London Stone|accessdate=16 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{National Heritage List for England |num=1286846 |desc=London Stone |accessdate= 9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A bronze plaque on the sloping top of the casing, dating from 1962, read:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;LONDON STONE&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
This is a fragment of the original piece of limestone once securely fixed in the ground now fronting Cannon Street Station.

Removed in 1742 to the north side of the street, in 1798 it was built into the south wall of the Church of St. Swithun London Stone which stood here until demolished in 1962.

Its origin and purpose are unknown but in 1188 there was a reference to Henry, son of Eylwin de Lundenstane, subsequently Lord Mayor of London.{{sfn|Clark|2007|p=169}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History==
&lt;!-- London Stone#History links here --&gt;
[[File:Copperplate map London Stone.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|London Stone and [[St Swithin, London Stone|St Swithin's Church]] as shown on the [[Copperplate map of London|"Copperplate" map]] of c.1553–59]]
When London Stone was erected and what its original function was are unknown, although there has been much speculation.

The stone was originally on the south side of medieval Candlewick Street (since widened to create modern Cannon Street) opposite the west end of [[St Swithin, London Stone|St Swithin's Church]], and is shown in this position on the [[Copperplate map of London|"Copperplate" map of London]], dating to the 1550s,{{sfn|Clark|2007|pages=171–2}} and on the derivative [[Woodcut map of London|"Woodcut" map]] of the 1560s. It was described by the London historian [[John Stow]] in 1598 as "a great stone called London stone", "pitched upright... fixed in the ground verie deep, fastned with bars of iron".&lt;ref name="Stow"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Stow |first=John |authorlink=John Stow |editor-last=Kingsford |editor-first=C.

The earliest reference to it is usually said to be that noted by [[John Stow]], in his ''[[John Stow#Survey of London|Survey of London]]'' (1598). Stow says that in a list of properties in London belonging to [[Christ Church, Canterbury]] (Canterbury Cathedral), one piece of land was described as lying "neare unto London stone".&lt;ref name="Stow" /&gt; This list, he says, had been bound into the end of a [[Gospel Book]] given to the cathedral by "''Ethelstane'' king of the west Saxons", usually identified as [[Æthelstan]], king of England (924–39). But it is impossible to confirm Stow's account, since the document he saw cannot now be identified with certainty. However, the earliest extant list of Canterbury's London properties, which has been dated to between 1098 and 1108, does refer to a property given to the cathedral by a man named "Eadwaker æt lundene stane" ("Eadwaker at London Stone").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kissan|first=B. W.|title=An early list of London properties|journal=Transactions of London and Middlesex Archaeological Society|year=1940 |series= new series| volume=8|issue=2|pages=57–69}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although not bound into a Gospel Book (it is now bound into a volume of miscellaneous medieval texts with a Canterbury provenance ([[Cotton library#Classification|MS Cotton Faustina]] B. vi) in the [[British Library]]), it could be that it was this, or a similar text, that Stow saw.{{sfn|Clark|2007|p=171}}

Like Eadwaker, other medieval Londoners acquired or adopted the [[byname]] "at London Stone" or "of London Stone" because they lived nearby. One of these was "Ailwin of London Stone", the father of [[Henry Fitz-Ailwin de Londonestone|Henry Fitz-Ailwin]] the first [[Lord Mayor of London|Mayor]] of the City of London, who took office at some time between 1189 and 1193, and governed the city until his death in 1212. The Fitz-Ailwin house stood away from Candlewick Street, on the north side of St Swithin's church.{{sfn|Clark|2007|p=171}}

London Stone was a well-known landmark in medieval London, and when in 1450 [[Jack Cade]], leader of a rebellion against the corrupt government of [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]], entered the city with his men, he struck his sword on London Stone and claimed to be "Lord of this city".{{sfn|Clark|2007|pages=179–86}} Contemporary accounts give no clue as to Cade's motivation, or how his followers or the Londoners would have interpreted his action. There is nothing to suggest he was carrying out a traditional ceremony or custom.

By the time of [[Queen Elizabeth I]] London Stone was not merely a landmark, shown and named on maps, but a visitor attraction in its own right. Tourists may have been told variously that it had stood there since before the city existed, or that it had been set up by order of [[Lud son of Heli|King Lud]], legendary rebuilder of London, or that it marked the centre of the city, or that it was "set [up] for the tendering and making of payment by debtors".&lt;ref name="Stow"/&gt;&lt;ref name="grenade"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Groos|first=G. W.|title=The Diary of Baron Waldstein: A Traveller in Elizabethan England|year=1981|publisher=Thames and Hudson|location=London|pages=174–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1608 it was listed in a poem by [[Samuel Rowlands]] as one of the "sights" of London (perhaps the first time the word was used in that sense) shown to "an honest Country foole" on a visit to town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rowlands|first=Samuel|authorlink=Samuel Rowlands|chapter=A straunge sighted Traueller|title=Humors Looking Glasse|year=1608|publisher=William Ferebrand|location=London|at=sig. D3 recto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 17th century the Stone continued be used as an "address", to identify a locality. Thus, for example, [[Thomas Heywood]]'s biography of [[Queen Elizabeth I]], ''Englands Elizabeth'' (1631), was, according to its title page, "printed by Iohn Beale, for Phillip Waterhouse; and are to be sold at his shop at St. Pauls head, neere London stone"; and the ''[[English Short Title Catalogue]]'' lists over 30 books published between 1629 and the 1670s with similar references to London Stone in the imprint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://estc.bl.uk/F/?func=file&amp;file_name=login-bl-estc|title=English Short Title Catalogue|publisher=British Library|accessdate=18 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1671 the [[Worshipful Company of Spectacle Makers]] broke up a batch of substandard spectacles on London Stone: "two and twenty dozen [= 264] of English spectacles, all very badd both in the glasse and frames not fitt to be put on sale... were found badd and deceitful and by judgement of the Court condemned to be broken, defaced and spoyled both glasse and frame the which judgement was executed accordingly in Canning [Cannon] Street on the remayning parte of London Stone where the same were with a hammer broken in all pieces."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Company History |url=http://www.spectaclemakers.com/company/history.htm |publisher=The Worshipful Company of Spectacle Makers |accessdate=21 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224124048/http://www.spectaclemakers.com/company/history.htm |archivedate=24 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Law|first=Frank W.|title=The Worshipful Company of Spectacle Makers: A History|year=1977|publisher=Worshipful Company of Spectacle Makers|location=London|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reference to "''the remayning parte'' of London Stone" may suggest that it had been damaged and reduced in size, perhaps in the [[Great Fire of London]] five years earlier, which had destroyed St Swithin's church and the neighbouring buildings; it was later covered with a small stone cupola to protect it.{{sfn|Clark|2007|p=173}}

In 1598 John Stow had commented that "if carts do run against it through negligence, the wheels be broken, and the stone itself unshaken",&lt;ref name="Stow"/&gt; and by 1742 it was considered an obstruction to traffic. The remaining part of the Stone was then moved, with its protective cupola, from the south side of the street to the north side, where it was first set beside the door of [[St Swithin, London Stone|St Swithin's Church]], which had been rebuilt by [[Christopher Wren]] after its destruction in the Great Fire. It was moved again in 1798 to the east end of the church's south wall, and finally in the 1820s set in an alcove in the centre of the wall within a solidly built stone frame set on a plinth, with a circular aperture through which the Stone itself could be seen. In 1869 the [[London and Middlesex Archaeological Society]] arranged for the installation of a protective iron grille and an explanatory inscription in Latin and English on the church wall above it.{{sfn|Clark|2007|pages=173–6}}

During the 19th and 20th centuries London Stone was regularly referred to in popular London histories and guidebooks, and visited by tourists. During his stay in England in the 1850s the American author [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] recorded a visit to London Stone in his journal, noting the indentations on the top "which are said to have been made by Jack Cade’s sword".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Hawthorne| first = Nathaniel| authorlink = Nathaniel Hawthorne | editor-last = Stewart | editor-first = Randall| title =  The English Notebooks: Based upon the Original Manuscripts in the Pierpont Morgan Library| place = New York &amp; London| publisher = Modern Languages Association of America, Oxford University Press | year = 1941 | page =289}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937 [[Arthur Mee]], founder of ''[[The Children's Newspaper]]'' and author of ''The King's England'' series of guidebooks, described it as "a fragment of its old self [...] said by some to have been a stone set up in Stone Age days".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mee|first=Arthur|authorlink=Arthur Mee|title=London: Heart of the Empire and Wonder of the World|year=1937|publisher=Hodder &amp; Stoughton|location=London|page=281}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The American archaeologist [[George Byron Gordon (archaeologist)|George Byron Gordon]] was more expansive (and fanciful) in the course of his ''Rambles in Old London'', published in 1924. London Stone, he tells us, was "the very oldest object in London streets". "The Mediaeval Kings after their coronations used to strike London Stone with their swords in token of the City’s submission" (followed of course by a reference to Jack Cade). "It was an object of great antiquity when the Romans arrived and their predecessors the ancient Britons found it on their arrival more than two thousand years before. It was erected by the people of the New Stone Age [...]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gordon|first=G. B.|authorlink=George Byron Gordon (archaeologist)|title=Rambles in Old London|year=1924|publisher=John Lane|location=London|pages=45–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940 St Swithin's church was burnt out by bombing in [[the Blitz]]. However, the outer walls remained standing for many years, with London Stone still in its place in the south wall. In 1962 the remains of the church were demolished, and replaced by an office building, 111 Cannon Street, which originally housed the [[Bank of China]]; London Stone was placed without ceremony in the specially constructed grilled and glazed alcove in the new building.{{sfn|Clark|2007|p=177}}

The office building was long scheduled for redevelopment, and in October 2011 the then landowners proposed to move the stone to a new location further to the west.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Enoch |last=Nick |title=Fury as developers plan to move legendary 900-year-old London Stone|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2091093/London-Stone-Fury-developers-plan-legendary-rock-historic-site.html#ixzz2NVW11vwD |location = London |work= Mail Online |date=25 January 2012| accessdate=14 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planning.cityoflondon.gov.uk:90/WAM/findCaseFile.do?councilName=Corporation+of+London&amp;appNumber=11/00664/LBC|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130505120037/http://www.planning.cityoflondon.gov.uk:90/WAM/findCaseFile.do?councilName=Corporation+of+London&amp;appNumber=11/00664/LBC|dead-url=yes|archive-date=5 May 2013|title=City of London Planning Case File: Relocation of London Stone|date=20 October 2011|accessdate=14 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2016, planning permission was granted to allow the building to be demolished and replaced by a new one. The stone was put on display at the [[Museum of London]] while the building works were carried out&lt;ref name="The Guardian 12 March 2016"&gt;{{cite news |last= Higgins |first= Charlotte |title= Psychogeographers' landmark London Stone goes on show at last |url= https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/mar/12/psychogeographers-landmark-london-stone-on-show-at-last | date= 12 March 2016|newspaper= [[The Guardian]] |location=London| accessdate= 14 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="City AM 10 May 2016"&gt;{{cite news |last= Neilan |first= Catherine |title= Mythic London Stone is going on show at Museum of London as current home on Cannon Street is demolished |url= http://www.cityam.com/240734/mythic-london-stone-is-going-on-show-at-museum-of-london-as-current-home-on-cannon-street-is-demolished | date= 10 May 2016|newspaper= [[City AM]] |location=London| accessdate= 10 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was returned in October 2018.

==Interpretations==
===16th century===
In 1598 the London historian [[John Stow]] admitted that "The cause why this stone was set there, the time when, or other memory hereof, is none".&lt;ref name="Stow"/&gt; However, his contemporary [[William Camden]], in ''[[William Camden#Britannia|Britannia]]'' (1586), his historical description of Great Britain, concluded that it was a Roman ''milliarium'', a central stone from which all distances in [[Roman Britain]] were measured, and similar to the [[Milliarium Aureum]] of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Camden | first = William | author-link = William Camden | title = Britannia | place = London | publisher = G. Bishop &amp; J. Norton | year = 1607 | page = 304 | language = Latin}}&lt;/ref&gt; This identification remains popular, although there is no archaeological evidence to support it.{{sfn|Clark|2007|p=178}} Camden's identification has been revived by [[John Michell (writer)|John Michell]] in his book &lt;nowiki/&gt;''The Sacred Centre''&lt;nowiki/&gt; (2009), where he identifies the stone as the London ''terminus'', a stone sacred to [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] that stood at the centre of every Roman city, and which parallels the golden milestone in the [[Forum Romanum|Forum]] in Rome. He believes it was at the intersection of the major axes of the Roman city, the north south ''[[Cardo Maximus]]'' and the east west ''[[Decumanus Maximus|Decumanus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Michell | first = John | author-link = John Michell (writer) | title = Sacred Center: The Ancient Art of Locating Sanctuaries | place = Rochester, VT | publisher = Inner Traditions | year = 2009 | pages = 4–5 | ISBN = 1594772843}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===18th century===
Alternatively, writers in the 18th century speculated that the Stone was prehistoric and had been an object of [[Druid]]ic worship.{{sfn|Clark|2010|p=42}} Although this suggestion is now generally dismissed, it was revived in 1914 by Elizabeth Gordon in her unorthodox book on the archaeology of [[History of London#Legendary foundations and prehistoric London|prehistoric London]], ''Prehistoric London: Its Mounds and Circles'', in which she envisaged London Stone as an ancient British "index stone" pointing to a great Druidic [[stone circle]], similar to [[Stonehenge]], that she claimed had once stood on the site of [[St Paul’s Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Gordon| first = E. O.| title = Prehistoric London: Its Mounds and Circles| place = London| publisher = Elliot Stock | year = 1914 | pages =3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; As we have seen, in 1924 American archaeologist George Byron Gordon claimed a [[Neolithic|"New Stone Age"]] date for it, but such claims do not find favour with modern archaeologists.{{sfn|Clark|2007|p=178}}

===19th century===
By the early 19th century, a number of writers had suggested that London Stone was once regarded as London's "Palladium", a talismanic monument in which, like the original [[Palladium (mythology)|Palladium]] of Troy, the city's safety and wellbeing were embodied.{{sfn|Clark|2010|p=43}} This view seemed to be confirmed when a pseudonymous contributor to the journal ''[[Notes and Queries]]'' in 1862 quoted a supposedly ancient proverb about London Stone to the effect that "So long as the Stone of Brutus is safe, so long shall London flourish".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mor Merrion|authorlink=Richard Williams Morgan|title=Stonehenge|journal=Notes and Queries|year=1862|series=3rd series|volume=1|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;!-- Please do not 'correct' spelling of Mor Merrion in the reference, that's how it's printed in the original --&gt;
This verse, if it were genuine, would link London Stone to [[Brutus of Troy]], legendary founder of London, as well as confirming its role as a Palladium.

However, the writer in ''Notes and Queries'' can be identified as the Revd [[Richard Williams Morgan]], an eccentric Welsh clergyman who in an earlier book ''The British Kymry or Britons of Cambria'' (1857) had claimed that the legendary Brutus was a historical figure; London Stone, he wrote, had been the plinth on which the original Trojan Palladium had stood, and was brought to Britain by Brutus and set up as the altar stone of the Temple of Diana in his new capital city of [[Trinovantum]] or "New Troy" (London).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Morgan | first = Richard Williams | authorlink = Richard Williams Morgan | title = The British Kymry or Britons of Cambria| place = Ruthin| publisher = Isaac Clarke| year = 1857| pages = 26–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; This story, and the verse about the "Stone of Brutus", can be found nowhere any earlier than in Morgan's writings, and it seems safe to assume that both are his own invention. No-one before Morgan had called London Stone "The Stone of Brutus", and although the spurious verse is still frequently quoted, there is no evidence that London's safety has ever traditionally been linked to that of London Stone.{{sfn|Clark|2010|pages=45–52}}

In 1881 [[Henry Charles Coote]] argued that London Stone's name and reputation arose simply because it was the last remaining fragment of the house of [[Henry Fitz-Ailwin de Londonestone|Henry Fitz-Ailwin of London Stone]] (''ca.'' 1135–1212), the first Mayor, although London Stone was mentioned about 100 years before Henry's time, and the Fitz-Ailwin house was some distance from the Stone on the other side of St Swithin's church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coote|first=H.

In 1890 the folklorist and London historian [[Laurence Gomme|George Laurence Gomme]] proposed that London Stone was the city's original "[[Fetishism|fetish stone]]", erected when the first prehistoric settlement was founded on the site and treated as sacred ever after.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Gomme | first = George Laurence | authorlink = Laurence Gomme | title = The Village Community: With Special Reference to the Origin and Form of its Survivals in Britain...| url=https://archive.org/details/villagecommunit00gomm|place = London| publisher = Walter Scott| year = 1890| pages=218–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, folklorist [[Lewis Spence]] combined this theory with Richard Williams Morgan's story of the "Stone of Brutus" to speculate about the pre-Roman origins of London in his book ''Legendary London'' (1937).&lt;ref name="Spence"&gt;{{cite book | last = Spence | first = Lewis | authorlink = Lewis Spence | title = Legendary London: Early London in Tradition and History| place = London| publisher = Robert Hale| year = 1937| pages=167–72}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Clark|2010|pages=52–4}}

[[File:London praetorium.jpg|thumb|right|The known [[floorplan]] of the presumed "[[Londonium#1st century|governor's palace]]"]]
By the 1960s, archaeologists had noted that in its original location London Stone would have been aligned on the centre of a large Roman building, probably an administrative building, now known to have lain in the area of [[Cannon Street station]]. This has been tentatively identified as a ''[[praetorium]]'', even the local "[[Londonium#1st century|governor's palace]]". It has further been suggested – originally by the archaeologist Peter Marsden, who excavated there between 1961 and 1972 – that the Stone may have formed part of its main entrance or gate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marsden|first=Peter|title=The excavation of a Roman palace site in London, 1961-1972|journal=Transactions of London and Middlesex Archaeological Society|year=1975|volume=26|pages=1–102 at pp. 63–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/Collections-Research/Research/Your-Research/Londinium/Today/vizrom/08+stone.htm|title=Londinium Today: London Stone|publisher=Museum of London|accessdate=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This "''praetorium'' gate theory", while impossible to prove, is the prevailing one among modern experts.&lt;ref&gt;Webb, Simon (2011), ''Life in Roman London'', The History Press, pp 142, 144, 154-55.&lt;/ref&gt;

London Stone has been identified as a "mark-stone" on several [[ley line]]s passing through central London.{{sfn|Clark|2010|pages = 54–5}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Street | first = Christopher E. | title = London's Ley Lines: Pathways of Enlightenment| place = London| publisher = Earthstars Publishing| year = 2010| isbn= 9780951596746| pages= 183–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also entered the [[psychogeography|psychogeographical]] writings of [[Iain Sinclair]] (born 1943) as an essential element in London's "[[sacred geometry]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Sinclair | first = Iain | authorlink = Iain Sinclair | title = Lights out for the Territory| place = London| publisher = Granta| year = 1997| isbn= 1862070091| page= 116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two recent additions to the mythology surrounding London Stone. The first claims that Dr [[John Dee]], astrologer, occultist and adviser to Queen Elizabeth I, "was fascinated by the supposed powers of the London Stone and lived close to it for a while" and may have chipped pieces off it for alchemical experiments; the second that a legend identifies it as the stone from which [[King Arthur]] pulled the [[Excalibur#Excalibur and the Sword in the Stone|sword]] to reveal that he was rightful king.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A863309|title= h2g2 The London Stone|accessdate=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these may have been inspired by the fictionalised John Dee of [[Peter Ackroyd]]'s 1993 novel ''[[The House of Doctor Dee]]'' (see [[#In literature|In literature]] below). Both these "legends" seem first to be recorded on the website [[h2g2]] in 2002.

So familiar was London Stone to Londoners that from an early date it features in London literature and in stories set in London. Thus, in an often reprinted anonymous satirical poem of the early 15th century, "London Lickpenny" (sometimes attributed to [[John Lydgate]]), the protagonist, lost and bewildered, passes London Stone during his wanderings through the city streets:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Then went I forth by London Stone

In about 1522 a pamphlet was published by the London printer [[Wynkyn de Worde]] with the long title: ''A Treatyse of a Galaunt, with the Maryage of the Fayre Pusell the Bosse of Byllyngesgate Unto London Stone''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anon.|title=A Treatyse of a Galaunt, with the Maryage of the Fayre Pusell the Bosse of Byllyngesgate Unto London Stone|year=1860|publisher=Printed for the Editor|location=London|url=https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UJ4NAAAAQAAJ|editor-last=Halliwell|editor-first=J. O.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It comprised two anonymous humorous poems, the second of which, ''The Maryage...'', just two pages in length, purports to be an invitation to the forthcoming wedding between London Stone and the "Bosse of Billingsgate", a water fountain near [[Billingsgate]] erected or renovated in the 1420s under the terms of the will of the [[Lord Mayor of London|mayor]] [[Richard Whittington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Stow| first = John| authorlink = John Stow | editor-last = Kingsford | editor-first = C.

The text, however, goes on to suggest that both London Stone and the Bosse were known for their steadfastness and reliability.

London Stone also features in a tract ''The Returne of the renowned Caualiero Pasquill of England...'' published in 1589.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Nashe| first = Thomas | authorlink = Thomas Nashe | editor-last = McKerrow | editor-first = Ronald B.| title = The Works of Thomas Nashe | place = Oxford | publisher = Blackwell | year = 1958 | edition = reprinted | volume = 1 | pages = 65–103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise known as ''Pasquill and Marforius'' it was one of three that were printed under the pseudonym of [[Pasquill (the Cavaliero)|the Cavaliero Pasquill]], and contributed to the [[Marprelate controversy]], a war of words between the Church of England establishment and its critics. At the end of this short work, Pasquill declares his intention of posting a notice on London Stone, inviting all critics of his opponent, the similarly pseudonymous [[Martin Marprelate]], to write out their complaints and stick them up on the Stone. Some writers have argued that this fictional episode proves that London Stone was a traditional place for making official proclamations,&lt;ref name="Spence"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Anon.| title = London Stone| journal = Chambers's Journal | series = 5th series| issue = 225| pages = 231–2 | date = 21 April 1888}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Jack Cade]] episode was dramatised in [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Henry VI, Part 2]]'' (Act 4, Scene 6), first performed in 1591 or 1592. In Shakespeare's elaborated version of the event, Cade strikes London Stone with a staff rather than a sword, then seats himself upon the Stone as if on a throne, to issue decrees and dispense rough justice to a follower who displeases him.{{sfn|Clark|2007|pages=180–1}}

In 1598, London Stone was again brought to the stage, in [[William Haughton]]'s comedy ''[[Englishmen for My Money]]'', when three foreigners, being led about on stage through the supposedly pitch-black night-time streets of London, blunder into it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stock|first=Angela|editor1-last=Gadd|editor1-first=Ian|editor2-last=Gillespie|editor2-first=Alexandra|title=John Stow (1525-1605) and the Making of the English Past|year=2004|publisher=British Library|isbn=0712348646|location=London|pages=89–98 at p. 95|chapter=Stow’s ''Survey'' and the London playwrights}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, London Stone was to play an important but not always consistent role in the visionary writings of [[William Blake]]. Thus in ''[[Jerusalem: The Emanation of the Giant Albion]]'', his long illustrated poem on engraved plates begun in 1804, London Stone is a [[Druid]]ic altar, the site of bloody sacrifices. Alternatively in  ''Jerusalem'' and in ''[[Milton a Poem]]'' it is the geographic centre of [[Golgonooza]], Blake's mystical city of London; it is a place where justice is delivered, where [[Los (Blake)|Los]] sits to hear the voice of Jerusalem, and where Reuben sleeps.{{sfn|Clark|2010|pages=43–5}}

In the last years of the 20th century and the early years of the 21st, London Stone has made an increasing number of appearances in novels of imagination and fantasy. In [[Peter Ackroyd]]'s novel ''[[The House of Doctor Dee]]'', the character Dr Dee, broadly based upon the historical figure of the occultist [[John Dee]], claims that London Stone is the last remnant above ground of a glorious antediluvian and now buried city of London that he is searching for. London Stone appears as an embodiment of evil in [[Charlie Fletcher]]'s trilogy for children ''[[Stoneheart]]''. It also features in ''The Midnight Mayor'', [[Catherine Webb|Kate Griffin]]'s second Matthew Swift novel about urban magic in London, and in [[China Miéville]]'s ''[[Kraken (novel)|Kraken]]'',&lt;ref name="The Guardian 12 March 2016"/&gt; in which it is the beating heart of London and the sports shop that houses it hides the headquarters of the "Londonmancers" who may know the whereabouts of the [[Kraken]] stolen from the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]]. The third of a series of fantasy novels for children ''The Nowhere Chronicles'' by [[Sarah Pinborough]], writing as Sarah Silverwood, is entitled ''The London Stone'': "The London Stone has been stolen and the Dark King rules the Nowhere..." In [[Marie Brennan]]'s ''Onyx Court'' series, the Stone is part of the magical bond between the mortal Prince of the Stone and the fairie court beneath London. It is also mentioned in [[Nicci French]]'s crime novel ''Tuesday's Gone''.

The stone appears in several chapters of [[Edward Rutherfurd]]'s novel, ''[[London (novel)|London]]'' (1997). In the second chapter we see it as the marker stone for all the roads in Roman [[Londinium]], and also sitting beside the wall of the Governor's Palace as mentioned above as a hypothesis of its use or origin. It is seen again in the ninth chapter where the main family unit of the novel bring in the character of the foundling who is found propped up against it. The stone is one of the many central focus points in the novel that the author uses to tie the different time periods together.

[[Ray Nelson]]'s science fiction novel ''Blake's Progress'' (1975), based on the writings of [[William Blake]], features an [[alternative history]] in which [[Cleopatra]] won the [[Battle of Actium]] and an [[Alexandria]]n Empire replaced the [[Roman Empire]]. In the alternate London, called Gogonooza, London Stone is still to be seen, standing in front of a Temple of [[Isis]].

'''Lonsdaleite''' (named in honour of [[Kathleen Lonsdale]]), also called '''hexagonal diamond''' in reference to the [[crystal structure]], is an [[allotrope of carbon]] with a hexagonal lattice. In nature, it forms when [[meteor]]ites containing [[graphite]] strike the Earth. The great heat and stress of the impact transforms the graphite into [[diamond]], but retains graphite's hexagonal [[crystal lattice]]. Lonsdaleite was first identified in 1967 from the [[Canyon Diablo meteorite]], where it occurs as microscopic crystals associated with diamond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Frondel|first = C.|author2=U.B.

It is translucent, brownish-yellow, and has an [[refractive index|index of refraction]] of 2.40 to 2.41 and a [[specific gravity]] of 3.2 to 3.3. Its [[hardness]] is theoretically superior to that of cubic diamond (up to 58% more), according to computational simulations, but natural specimens exhibited somewhat lower hardness through a large range of values (from 7 to 8 on [[Mohs hardness scale]]).  The cause is speculated as being due to the samples having been riddled with lattice defects and impurities.&lt;ref&gt;Computational Methods and Experimental Measurements XV, by G. M. Carlomagno &amp; C. A. Brebbia, WIT Press, 2011, {{ISBN|978-1-84564-540-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The property of lonsdaleite as a discrete material has been questioned, since specimens under [[crystallography|crystallographic]] inspection showed not a bulk hexagonal lattice, but instead cubic diamond dominated by structural defects that include hexagonal sequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/ncomms6447|author=Nemeth, P. |author2=Garvie, L.A.J. |author3=Aoki, T. |author4=Natalia, D. |author5=Dubrovinsky, L. |author6=Buseck, P.R. |date=2014|title=Lonsdaleite is faulted and twinned cubic diamond and does not exist as a discrete material|journal=Nature Communications|volume=5 |pages=5447 |pmid=25410324|bibcode=2014NatCo...5E5447N}}&lt;/ref&gt; A quantitative analysis of the [[X-ray diffraction]] data of lonsdaleite has shown that about equal amounts of hexagonal and cubic stacking sequences are present. Consequently, it has been suggested that "stacking disordered diamond" is the most accurate structural description of lonsdaleite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.diamond.2015.09.007|author=Salzmann, C.G. |author2=Murray, B.J. |author3=Shephard, J.J.|date=2015|title=Extent of Stacking Disorder in Diamond|journal=Diamond and Related Materials|volume=59|pages=69–72|url=http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/93345/|arxiv=1505.02561|bibcode=2015DRM....59...69S}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, recent shock experiments with [[in situ]] X-ray diffraction show strong evidence for creation of relatively pure lonsdaleite in dynamic high-pressure environments such as meteorite impacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/ncomms10970|author=Kraus, D. |author2=Ravasio, A. |author3=Gauthier, M. |author4=Gericke, D.O. |author5=Vorberger, J. |author6=Frydrych, S. |author7=Helfrich, J. |author8=Fletcher, L.B. |author9=Schaumann, G. |author10=Nagler, B. |author11= Barbrel, B. |author12=Bachmann, B. |author13=Gamboa, E.J. |author14=Goede, S. |author15=Granados, E. |author16=Gregori, G. |author17=Lee, H.J. |author18=Neumayer, P. |author19=Schumaker, W. |author20=Doeppner, T. |author21=Falcone, R.W. |author22=Glenzer, S.H. |author23=Roth, M. |date=2016|title=Nanosecond formation of diamond and lonsdaleite by shock compression of graphite |journal=Nature Communications|volume=7 |pages=10970 |pmid=26972122 |pmc=4793081|bibcode=2016NatCo...710970K }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Turneaure|first=Stefan J.|last2=Sharma|first2=Surinder M.|last3=Volz|first3=Travis J.|last4=Winey|first4=J.

==Properties==
According to the traditional picture, Lonsdaleite has a [[hexagonal crystal system|hexagonal]] [[unit cell]], related to the [[diamond]] unit cell in the same way that the hexagonal and cubic [[Close-packing|close packed]] [[crystal system]]s are related. The diamond structure can be considered to be made up of interlocking rings of six carbon atoms, in the [[chair conformation]]. In lonsdaleite, some rings are in the [[boat conformation]] instead. At the nanoscale dimensions cubic diamond is represented by [[diamondoid]]s while hexagonal diamond is represented by wurtzoids.&lt;ref&gt;Abdulsattar, M. (2015) Molecular approach to hexagonal and cubic diamond nanocrystals. Carbon letters, 16(3), pp.192-197.&lt;/ref&gt; In diamond, all the carbon-to-carbon bonds, both within a layer of rings and between them, are in the [[staggered conformation]], thus causing all four cubic-diagonal directions to be equivalent; while in lonsdaleite the bonds between layers are in the [[eclipsed conformation]], which defines the axis of hexagonal symmetry.

Lonsdaleite is simulated to be 58% harder than diamond on the [[Miller index|&lt;100&gt;]] face and to resist indentation pressures of 152 [[GPa]], whereas diamond would break at 97 GPa.&lt;ref name=theory&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Pan, Zicheng |author2=Sun, Hong |author3=Zhang, Yi |author4=Chen, Changfeng |last-author-amp=yes |title=Harder than Diamond: Superior Indentation Strength of Wurtzite BN and Lonsdaleite |journal=Physical Review Letters|issue= 5|pages=055503|date=2009|laysummary=http://www.physorg.com/news153658987.html|laysource=Physorg.com|laydate=12 February 2009|doi= 10.1103/PhysRevLett.102.055503|volume=102|pmid=19257519|bibcode=2009PhRvL.102e5503P}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is yet exceeded by [[diamond type|IIa]] [[material properties of diamond|diamond]]'s &lt;111&gt; tip hardness of 162 GPa.

==Occurrence==
Lonsdaleite occurs as microscopic crystals associated with diamond in several meteorites: [[Canyon Diablo meteorite|Canyon Diablo]], [[Kenna meteorite|Kenna]], and [[Allan Hills 77283]]. It is also naturally occurring in non-bolide diamond [[placer deposit]]s in the [[Sakha Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kaminskii, F.V., G.K. Blinova, E.M. Galimov, G.A. Gurkina, Y.A.

'''''Maracaibo''''' is a 1958 American [[drama film]] directed by [[Cornel Wilde]] and written by Ted Sherdeman. The film stars [[Cornel Wilde]], [[Jean Wallace]], [[Abbe Lane]], [[Francis Lederer]], [[Michael Landon]] and [[Joe E. Ross]]. The film was released on May 21, 1958, by [[Paramount Pictures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/82883/Maracaibo/ |title=Maracaibo (1958) - Overview |publisher=Turner Classic Movies |date=1958-05-21 |accessdate=2015-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/101580/Maracaibo/overview |title=Maracaibo - Trailer - Cast - Showtimes |work=[[The New York Times]] |date= |accessdate=2015-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
{{Expand section|date=July 2015}}
[[Red Adair]]–type former Navy Frogman Vic Scott is on vacation in Venezuela when a huge oil fire at a well of his rich friend erupts. While romancing a newly-famous novelist from New York a colleague locates him and persuades him to help put out the blaze, just as theirs is starting.

More romance than adventure for the first two-thirds of the film, ''Maracaibo'' ultimately settles down to dramatic scenes of underwater work to extinguish the fire before a huge storm arrives. The action is interrupted from time to time to explore the romantic angle, including scenes between Abbe Lane's character and Cornel Wilde's, who were lovers only a few years prior—though she is now engaged to the rich oil baron.

Will her past be revealed? Will the New York author get her man? Will Vic Scott put out the fire near Maracaibo before it reaches the city, then finally settle down?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1102">The '''molecular configuration''' of a [[molecule]] is the ''permanent'' geometry that results from the [[space|spatial]] arrangement of its [[chemical bond|bonds]].  The ability of the same set of atoms to form two or more molecules with different configurations is [[stereoisomerism]].  Used as drugs, compounds with different configuration normally have ''different'' physiological activity, including the desired pharmacological effect, the toxicology and the metabolism.&lt;ref name=Ariens&gt;Everhardus Ariëns: ''Stereochemistry, a basis for sophisticated nonsense in pharmacokinetics and clinical pharmacology'', European Journal of Clinical Pharmacology 26 (1984) 663-668, {{DOI|10.1007/BF00541922}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Configuration is distinct from [[Conformational isomerism|chemical conformation]], a shape attainable by bond [[rotation]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28450">In [[aerodynamics]], the '''normal shock tables''' are a series of tabulated data listing the various properties before and after the occurrence of a [[Normal shock|normal shock wave]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Anderson, John D.| title=Fundamentals of Aerodynamics | publisher=McGraw-Hill | edition=4th |year=2007 | isbn=0-07-125408-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With a given upstream [[Mach number]], the post-shock Mach number can be calculated along with the [[pressure]], [[density]], [[temperature]], and [[stagnation pressure]] ratios.  Such tables are useful since the equations used to calculate the properties after a normal shock are cumbersome.

The tables below have been calculated using a [[heat capacity ratio]], &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;, equal to 1.4.  The upstream Mach number, &lt;math&gt;M_1&lt;/math&gt;, begins at 1 and ends at 5.  Although the tables could be extended over any range of Mach numbers, stopping at Mach 5 is typical since assuming &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; to be 1.4 over the entire Mach number range leads to errors over 10% beyond Mach 5.

==Normal shock table equations==
Given an upstream Mach number, &lt;math&gt;M_1&lt;/math&gt;, and the ratio of specific heats, &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;, the post normal shock Mach number, &lt;math&gt;M_2&lt;/math&gt;, can be calculated using the equation below.
:&lt;math&gt; M_2 = \sqrt{\frac{M_1^2\left(\gamma - 1\right)+2}{2\gamma M_1^2 - \left(\gamma - 1\right)}}&lt;/math&gt;

The next equation shows the relationship between the post normal shock pressure, &lt;math&gt;p_2&lt;/math&gt;, and the upstream ambient pressure, &lt;math&gt;p_1&lt;/math&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{p_2}{p_1} = \frac{2\gamma M_1^2}{\gamma + 1} - \frac{\gamma - 1}{\gamma + 1}&lt;/math&gt;

The relationship between the post normal shock density, &lt;math&gt;\rho_2&lt;/math&gt;, and the upstream ambient density, &lt;math&gt;\rho_1&lt;/math&gt; is shown next in the tables.
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\rho_2}{\rho_1} = \frac{\left(\gamma + 1\right)M_1^2}{\left(\gamma - 1\right)M_1^2 + 2}&lt;/math&gt;

Next, the equation below shows the relationship between the post normal shock temperature, &lt;math&gt;T_2&lt;/math&gt;, and the upstream ambient temperature, &lt;math&gt;T_1&lt;/math&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{T_2}{T_1} = \frac{\left(1 + \frac{\gamma - 1}{2}M_1^2\right)\left(\frac{2\gamma}{\gamma - 1}M_1^2 - 1\right)}{M_1^2\left(\frac{2\gamma}{\gamma - 1} + \frac{\gamma - 1}{2}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

Finally, the ratio of stagnation pressures is shown below where &lt;math&gt;p_{01}&lt;/math&gt; is the upstream stagnation pressure and &lt;math&gt;p_{02}&lt;/math&gt; occurs after the normal shock.  The ratio of stagnation temperatures remains constant across a normal shock since the process is [[Adiabatic Process|adiabatic]].
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{p_{02}}{p_{01}} = \left(\frac{\frac{\gamma + 1}{2}M_1^2}{1 + \frac{\gamma - 1}{2}M_1^2}\right)^\frac{\gamma}{\gamma - 1}\left(\frac{1}{\frac{2\gamma}{\gamma + 1}M_1^2 - \frac{\gamma - 1}{\gamma + 1}}\right)^\frac{1}{\gamma - 1}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Paramagnetism''' is a form of [[magnetism]] whereby certain materials are weakly attracted by an externally applied [[magnetic field]], and form internal, [[Magnetization|induced magnetic field]]s in the direction of the applied magnetic field. In contrast with this behavior, [[diamagnetism|diamagnetic]] materials are repelled by magnetic fields and form induced magnetic fields in the direction opposite to that of the applied magnetic field.&lt;ref&gt;Miessler, G. L. and Tarr, D. A. (2010) ''Inorganic Chemistry'' 3rd ed., Pearson/Prentice Hall publisher, {{ISBN|0-13-035471-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Paramagnetic materials include most [[chemical element]]s and some compounds;&lt;ref name=brit/&gt; they have a relative [[magnetic permeability]] slightly greater than 1 (i.e., a small positive [[magnetic susceptibility]]) and hence are attracted to magnetic fields. The [[magnetic moment]] induced by the applied field is linear in the field strength and rather weak. It typically requires a sensitive analytical balance to detect the effect and modern measurements on paramagnetic materials are often conducted with a [[SQUID]] [[magnetometer]].

Paramagnetism is due to the presence of [[unpaired electron]]s in the material, so all atoms with incompletely filled [[atomic orbital]]s are paramagnetic.  Due to their [[spin (physics)|spin]], unpaired electrons have a [[magnetic dipole moment]] and act like tiny magnets.  An external magnetic field causes the electrons' spins to align parallel to the field, causing a net attraction.   Paramagnetic materials include [[aluminium]], [[oxygen]], [[titanium]], and [[iron oxide]] (FeO).

Unlike [[ferromagnetism|ferromagnets]], paramagnets do not retain any magnetization in the absence of an externally applied magnetic field because [[thermal motion]] randomizes the spin orientations. (Some paramagnetic materials retain spin disorder even at [[absolute zero]], meaning they are paramagnetic in the [[ground state]], i.e. in the absence of thermal motion.) Thus the total magnetization drops to zero when the applied field is removed. Even in the presence of the field there is only a small induced magnetization because only a small fraction of the spins will be oriented by the field. This fraction is proportional to the field strength and this explains the linear dependency. The attraction experienced by ferromagnetic materials is non-linear and much stronger, so that it is easily observed, for instance, in the attraction between a [[refrigerator magnet]] and the iron of the refrigerator itself.

==Relation to electron spins==
Constituent atoms or molecules of paramagnetic materials have permanent magnetic moments ([[dipole]]s), even in the absence of an applied field. The permanent moment generally is due to the spin of unpaired electrons in [[Atomic orbital|atomic]] or [[Molecular orbital|molecular electron orbitals]] (see [[Magnetic moment]]).  In pure paramagnetism, the  [[dipoles]] do not interact with one another and are randomly oriented in the absence of an external field due to thermal agitation, resulting in zero net magnetic moment. When a magnetic field is applied, the dipoles will tend to align with the applied field, resulting in a net magnetic moment in the direction of the applied field. In the classical description, this alignment can be understood to occur due to a [[torque]] being provided on the magnetic moments by an applied field, which tries to align the dipoles parallel to the applied field. However, the true origins of the alignment can only be understood via the [[quantum mechanics|quantum-mechanical]] properties of [[spin (physics)|spin]] and [[angular momentum]].

If there is sufficient energy exchange between neighbouring dipoles, they will interact, and may spontaneously align or anti-align and form magnetic domains, resulting in [[ferromagnetism]] (permanent magnets) or [[antiferromagnetism]], respectively. Paramagnetic behavior can also be observed in ferromagnetic materials that are above their [[Curie temperature]], and in antiferromagnets above their [[Néel temperature]]. At these temperatures, the available thermal energy simply overcomes the interaction energy between the spins.

In general, paramagnetic effects are quite small: the [[magnetic susceptibility]] is of the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; for most paramagnets, but may be as high as 10&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; for synthetic paramagnets such as [[ferrofluid]]s.

In conductive materials, the electrons are [[delocalized]], that is, they travel through the solid more or less as [[Free particle|free electrons]]. Conductivity can be understood in a [[band structure]] picture as arising from the incomplete filling of energy bands.
In an ordinary nonmagnetic conductor the conduction band is identical for both spin-up and spin-down electrons. When a magnetic field is applied, the conduction band splits apart into a spin-up and a spin-down band due to the difference in [[magnetic potential energy]] for spin-up and spin-down electrons.
Since the [[Fermi level]] must be identical for both bands, this means that there will be a small surplus of the type of spin in the band that moved downwards. This effect is a weak form of paramagnetism known as ''Pauli paramagnetism''.

The effect always competes with a [[diamagnetic]] response of opposite sign due to all the core electrons of the atoms. Stronger forms of magnetism usually require localized rather than itinerant electrons. However, in some cases a band structure can result in which there are two delocalized sub-bands with states of opposite spins that have different energies. If one subband is preferentially filled over the other, one can have itinerant ferromagnetic order. This situation usually only occurs in relatively narrow (d-)bands, which are poorly delocalized.

====s and p electrons====
Generally, strong delocalization in a solid due to large overlap with neighboring wave functions means that there will be a large [[Fermi velocity]]; this means that the number of electrons in a band is less sensitive to shifts in that band's energy, implying a weak magnetism. This is why s- and p-type metals are typically either Pauli-paramagnetic or as in the case of gold even diamagnetic. In the latter case the diamagnetic contribution from the closed shell inner electrons simply wins over the weak paramagnetic term of the almost free electrons.

====d and f electrons====
Stronger magnetic effects are typically only observed when d or f electrons are involved. Particularly the latter are usually strongly localized. Moreover, the size of the magnetic moment on a lanthanide atom can be quite large as it can carry up to 7 unpaired electrons in the case of [[gadolinium]](III) (hence its use in [[MRI]]). The high magnetic moments associated with lanthanides is one reason why [[rare-earth magnet|superstrong magnets]] are typically based on elements like [[neodymium]] or [[samarium]].

====Molecular localization====
The above picture is a ''generalization'' as it pertains to materials with an extended lattice rather than a molecular structure. Molecular structure can also lead to localization of electrons. Although there are usually energetic reasons why a molecular structure results such that it does not exhibit partly filled orbitals (i.e. unpaired spins), some non-closed shell moieties do occur in nature. Molecular oxygen is a good example. Even in the frozen solid it contains di-radical molecules resulting in paramagnetic behavior. The unpaired spins reside in orbitals derived from oxygen p wave functions, but the overlap is limited to the one neighbor in the O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules. The distances to other oxygen atoms in the lattice remain too large to lead to delocalization and the magnetic moments remain unpaired.

==Theory==
The [[Bohr–van Leeuwen theorem]] proves that there cannot be any diamagnetism or paramagnetism in a purely classical system. The paramagnetic response has then two possible quantum origins, either coming from permanents magnetic moments of the ions or from the spatial motion of the conduction electrons inside the material. Both description are given below.
===Curie's law ===
{{main|Curie's law}}
For low levels of magnetization, the magnetization of paramagnets follows what is known as [[Curie's law]], at least approximately.  This law indicates that the susceptibility, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \chi&lt;/math&gt;, of paramagnetic materials is inversely proportional to their temperature, i.e. that materials become more magnetic at lower temperatures.  The mathematical expression is:
:&lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{M} = \chi\boldsymbol{H} = \frac{C}{T}\boldsymbol{H}&lt;/math&gt;

where:
: &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is the resulting magnetization, measured in [[ampere]]s/meter (A/m),
: &lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt; is the [[magnetic susceptibility|volume magnetic susceptibility]] ([[Dimensionless quantity|dimensionless]]),
: &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is the auxiliary [[magnetic field]] (A/m),
: &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is absolute temperature, measured in [[kelvin]]s (K),
: &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is a material-specific [[Curie constant]] (K).

Curie's law is valid under the commonly encountered conditions of low magnetization (''μ''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''H'' ≲ ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T''), but does not apply in the high-field/low-temperature regime where saturation of magnetization occurs (''μ''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''H'' ≳ ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T'') and magnetic dipoles are all aligned with the applied field. When the dipoles are aligned, increasing the external field will not increase the total magnetization since there can be no further alignment.

For a paramagnetic ion with noninteracting magnetic moments with angular momentum ''J'', the Curie constant is related the individual ions' magnetic moments,

:&lt;math&gt;C=\frac{n}{3k_\mathrm{B}}\mu_{\mathrm{eff}}^2 \text{ where } \mu_{\mathrm{eff}} = g_J \mu_\mathrm{B} \sqrt{J(J+1)}.&lt;/math&gt;

where ''n'' is the number of atoms per unit volume. The parameter ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt; is interpreted as the effective magnetic moment per paramagnetic ion.  If one uses a classical treatment with molecular magnetic moments represented as discrete magnetic dipoles, ''μ'', a Curie Law expression of the same form will emerge with ''μ'' appearing in place of ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt;.

If orbital contributions to the magnetic moment are negligible (a common case), then in what follows ''J'' = ''S''.  If we apply a magnetic field along what we choose to call the z-axis, the energy levels of each paramagnetic center will experience [[Zeeman splitting]] of its energy levels, each with a ''z''-component labeled by ''M&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' (or just  ''M&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;'' for the spin-only magnetic case).  Applying semiclassical [[Boltzmann statistics]], the magnetization of such a substance is

: &lt;math&gt;n\bar{m} = \frac{n\sum\limits_{M_{J} = -J}^{J}{\mu_{M_{J}}e^{{-E_{M_{J}}}/{k_{\mathrm{B}}T}\;}}}{\sum\limits_{M_{J} = -J}^{J}{e^{{-E_{M_{J}}}/{k_{\mathrm{B}}T}\;}}} = \frac{n\sum\limits_{M_{J} = -J}^{J}{M_{J}g_{J}\mu_{\mathrm{B}}e^{{M_{J}g_{J}\mu_{\mathrm{B}}H}/{k_{\mathrm{B}}T}\;}}}{\sum\limits_{M_{J} = -J}^{J}{e^{{M_{J}g_{J}\mu_{\mathrm{B}}H}/{k_{\mathrm{B}}T}\;}}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;\mu_{M_J}&lt;/math&gt; is the ''z''-component of the magnetic moment for each Zeeman level, so &lt;math&gt;\mu _{M_J} = M_J g_J\mu_\mathrm{B} - \mu_\mathrm{B}&lt;/math&gt; is called the [[Bohr magneton]] and ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''J''&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Landé g-factor]], which reduces to the free-electron g-factor, ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt; when&amp;nbsp;''J''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''S''.  (in this treatment, we assume that the ''x''- and ''y''-components of the magnetization, averaged over all molecules, cancel out because the field applied along the ''z''-axis leave them randomly oriented.)  The energy of each Zeeman level is &lt;math&gt;E_{M_J} = -M_J g_J \mu_\mathrm{B} H&lt;/math&gt;.  For temperatures over a few ''K'', &lt;math&gt;M_J g_J \mu_\mathrm{B}H/k_\mathrm{B} T \ll 1&lt;/math&gt;, and  we can apply the approximation &lt;math&gt;e^{M_J g_J \mu_\mathrm{B} H /k_\mathrm{B} T\;} \simeq 1 + M_J g_J \mu_\mathrm{B} H/k_\mathrm{B} T\;&lt;/math&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;\bar{m}=\frac{\sum\limits_{M_J=-J}^J {M_J g_J \mu_\mathrm{B} e^{M_J g_J \mu_\mathrm{B} H/k_\mathrm{B} T\;}}}{\sum\limits_{M_J=-J}^J e^{M_Jg_J\mu_\mathrm{B} H/k_\mathrm{B} T\;}}\simeq g_J\mu_\mathrm{B} \frac{\sum\limits_{M_J=-J}^J M_J \left( 1+M_J g_J\mu_\mathrm{B} H/k_\mathrm{B} T\; \right)}{\sum\limits_{M_J=-J}^J \left( 1+M_J g_J \mu_\mathrm{B} H/k_\mathrm{B} T \; \right)}=\frac{g_J^2 \mu_\mathrm{B}^2 H}{k_\mathrm{B} T} \frac{\sum\limits_{-J}^J M_J^2}{\sum\limits_{M_J=-J}^J{(1)}},&lt;/math&gt;

which yields:
:&lt;math&gt;\bar{m}=\frac{g_J^2 \mu_\mathrm{B}^2 H}{3k_\mathrm{B} T} J(J+1)&lt;/math&gt;.  The bulk magnetization is then &lt;math&gt;M=n\bar{m} = \frac{n}{3k_\mathrm{B}T} \left[ g_J^2 J(J+1) \mu_\mathrm{B}^2 \right]H,&lt;/math&gt;

and the susceptibility is given by

: &lt;math&gt;\chi=\frac{\partial M_{\rm m}}{\partial H} = \frac{n}{3k_{\rm B} T} \mu_{\mathrm{eff}}^2 \text{  ;    and     } \mu_{\mathrm{eff}} = g_J \sqrt{J(J+1)} \mu_{\mathrm B}.&lt;/math&gt;
|}

When orbital angular momentum contributions to the magnetic moment are small, as occurs for most organic radicals or for octahedral transition metal complexes with d&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; or high-spin d&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; configurations, the effective magnetic moment takes the form ( with [[G-factor (physics)|g-factor]] ''g''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; = 2.0023... ≈ 2),

:&lt;math&gt;\mu_{\mathrm{eff}}\simeq 2\sqrt{S(S+1)} \mu_\mathrm{B} =\sqrt{N_{\rm u}(N_{\rm u}+2)} \mu_\mathrm{B},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''N''&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of [[Unpaired electron|unpaired electrons]].  In other transition metal complexes this yields a useful, if somewhat cruder, estimate.

=== Pauli paramagnetism ===
For some alkali metals and noble metals, conductions electrons are weakly interacting and delocalized in space forming a [[Fermi gas]]. For these materials one contribution to the magnetic response  comes from the interaction with the electron spins and the magnetic field known as Pauli paramagnetism. For a small magnetic field &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{H}&lt;/math&gt;, the additional energy per electron added from the interaction between an electron spin and the magnetic field is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta E= -\mu_0\mathbf{H}\cdot\boldsymbol{\mu}_e=\mp \mu_0\mathbf{H}\cdot\left(-g_e\frac{\mu_\mathrm{B}}{\hbar}\mathbf{S}\right)=\pm \mu_0 \mu_\mathrm{B} H,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\mu}_e&lt;/math&gt; is the [[electron magnetic moment]], &lt;math&gt;\mu_B&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Bohr magneton]], &lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt; is the reduced Planck constant, and the [[g-factor (physics)|g-factor]] cancels with the spin &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{S}=\pm\hbar/2&lt;/math&gt;. The &lt;math&gt;\pm&lt;/math&gt; indicates that the sign is positive (negative) when the electron spin component in the direction of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{H}&lt;/math&gt; is parallel (antiparallel) to the magnetic field.
[[File:Pauli_2bis.jpg|thumb|right|In a metal, the application of an external magnetic field increases the density of electrons with spins antiparallel with the field and lowers the density of the electrons with opposite spin. Note: The arrows in this picture indicate magnetic moment, not spin direction.]]

For low temperatures with respect to the [[Fermi energy|Fermi temperature]] &lt;math&gt;T_F&lt;/math&gt; (around 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; [[Kelvin|kelvins]] for metals), the [[number density]] of electrons &lt;math&gt;n_{\uparrow}&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;n_{\downarrow}&lt;/math&gt;) pointing parallel (antiparallel) to the magnetic field can be written as:

:&lt;math&gt;n_{\uparrow}\approx\frac{n_e}{2}-\frac{\mu_0\mu_\mathrm{B}}{2}g(E_\mathrm{F})H\quad;\quad \left(n_{\downarrow}\approx\frac{n_e}{2}+\frac{\mu_0\mu_\mathrm{B}}{2}g(E_\mathrm{F})H\right),&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;n_e&lt;/math&gt; the total free-electrons density and &lt;math&gt;g(E_\mathrm{F})&lt;/math&gt; the electronic density of states (number of states per energy per volume) at the [[Fermi energy]] &lt;math&gt;E_\mathrm{F}&lt;/math&gt;. 

In this approximation the magnetization is given as the magnetic moment of one electron times the difference in densities:

:&lt;math&gt;M=\mu_\mathrm{B}(n_{\downarrow}-n_{\uparrow})=\mu_0\mu_\mathrm{B}^2g(E_\mathrm{F})H,&lt;/math&gt;

which yields a positive paramagnetic susceptibility independent of temperature:

:&lt;math&gt;\chi_\mathrm{P}=\mu_0\mu_\mathrm{B}^2g(E_\mathrm{F}).&lt;/math&gt;

The Pauli paramagnetic susceptibility is a macroscopic effect and has to be contrasted with [[Landau diamagnetism|Landau diamagnetic susceptibility]] which is equal to minus one third of Pauli's and also comes from delocalized electrons. The Pauli susceptibility comes from the spin interaction with the magnetic field while the Landau susceptibility comes from the spatial motion of the electrons and it is independent of the spin. In doped semiconductors the ratio between Landau's and Pauli's susceptibilities changes as the [[effective mass (solid-state physics)|effective mass]] of the charge carriers &lt;math&gt;m^*&lt;/math&gt; can differ from the electron mass &lt;math&gt;m_e&lt;/math&gt;. 

The magnetic response calculated for a gas of electrons is not the full picture as the magnetic susceptibility coming from the ions has to be included. Additionally, this formulas may break down for confined systems that differ from the bulk, like [[quantum dot]]s, or  for high fields, as demonstrated in the [[de Haas-van Alphen effect]].

Pauli paramagnetism is named after the physicist [[Wolfgang Pauli]]. Before Pauli's theory, the lack of a strong Curie paramagnetism in metals was an open problem as the [[Drude model|leading model]] could not account for this contribution without the use of [[Fermi–Dirac statistics|quantum statistics]].

==Examples of paramagnets==
Materials that are called "paramagnets" are most often those that exhibit, at least over an appreciable temperature range, magnetic susceptibilities that adhere to the Curie or Curie–Weiss laws. In principle any system that contains atoms, ions, or molecules with unpaired spins can be called a paramagnet, but the interactions between them need to be carefully considered.

===Systems with minimal interactions===
The narrowest definition would be: a system with unpaired spins that ''do not interact'' with each other. In this narrowest sense, the only pure paramagnet is a dilute gas of [[monatomic hydrogen]] atoms. Each atom has one non-interacting unpaired electron. The latter could be said about a gas of lithium atoms but these already possess two paired core electrons that produce a diamagnetic response of opposite sign. Strictly speaking Li is a mixed system therefore, although admittedly the diamagnetic component is weak and often neglected. In the case of heavier elements the diamagnetic contribution becomes more important and in the case of metallic gold it dominates the properties. The element hydrogen is virtually never called 'paramagnetic' because the monatomic gas is stable only at extremely high temperature; H atoms combine to form molecular H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and in so doing, the magnetic moments are lost (''quenched''), because of the spins pair. Hydrogen is therefore ''diamagnetic'' and the same holds true for many other elements. Although the electronic configuration of the individual atoms (and ions) of most elements contain unpaired spins, they are not necessarily paramagnetic, because at ambient temperature quenching is very much the rule rather than the exception. The quenching tendency is weakest for f-electrons because ''f'' (especially 4''f'') orbitals are radially contracted and they overlap only weakly with orbitals on adjacent atoms.  Consequently, the lanthanide elements with incompletely filled 4f-orbitals are paramagnetic or magnetically ordered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www2.nbi.ku.dk/page40667.htm|title=Rare Earth Magnetism|author1=Jensen, J.  |author2=MacKintosh, A.

Thus, condensed phase paramagnets are only possible if the interactions of the spins that lead either to quenching or to ordering are kept at bay by structural isolation of the magnetic centers. There are two classes of materials for which this holds:
*Molecular materials with a (isolated) paramagnetic center.
** Good examples are [[coordination complex]]es of d- or f-metals or proteins with such centers, e.g. [[myoglobin]]. In such materials the organic part of the molecule acts as an envelope shielding the spins from their neighbors.
** Small molecules can be stable in radical form, [[oxygen]] O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a good example. Such systems are quite rare because they tend to be rather reactive.
* Dilute systems.
** Dissolving a  paramagnetic species in a diamagnetic lattice at small concentrations, e.g. Nd&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; in CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; will separate the neodymium ions at large enough distances that they do not interact. Such systems are of prime importance for what can be considered the most sensitive method to study paramagnetic systems: [[Electron paramagnetic resonance|EPR]].

===Systems with interactions===
[[File:Para-ferro-anti.jpg|thumb|300px|Idealized Curie–Weiss behavior; N.B. T&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;=θ, but T&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt; is not θ. Paramagnetic regimes are denoted by solid lines. Close to T&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt; or T&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; the behavior usually deviates from ideal.]]

As stated above, many materials that contain d- or f-elements do retain unquenched spins. Salts of such elements often show paramagnetic behavior but at low enough temperatures the magnetic moments may order. It is not uncommon to call such materials 'paramagnets', when referring to their paramagnetic behavior above their Curie or Néel-points, particularly if such temperatures are very low or have never been properly measured.  Even for iron it is not uncommon to say that ''iron becomes a paramagnet'' above its relatively high Curie-point. In that case the Curie-point is seen as a [[phase transition]] between a ferromagnet and a 'paramagnet'. The word paramagnet now merely refers to the linear response of the system to an applied field, the temperature dependence of which requires an amended version of Curie's law, known as the [[Curie–Weiss law]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{M} = \frac{C}{T- \theta}\boldsymbol{H}&lt;/math&gt;

This amended law includes a term θ that describes the exchange interaction that is present albeit overcome by thermal motion. The sign of θ depends on whether ferro- or antiferromagnetic interactions dominate and it is seldom exactly zero, except in the dilute, isolated cases mentioned above.

Obviously, the paramagnetic Curie–Weiss description above ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt; or ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''C''&lt;/sub&gt; is a rather different interpretation of the word "paramagnet" as it does ''not'' imply the ''absence'' of interactions, but rather that the [[magnetic structure]] is random in the absence of an external field at these sufficiently high temperatures. Even if ''θ'' is close to zero this does not mean that there are no interactions, just that the aligning ferro- and the anti-aligning antiferromagnetic ones cancel. An additional complication is that the interactions are often different in different directions of the crystalline lattice ([[anisotropy]]), leading to complicated [[magnetic structure]]s once ordered.

Randomness of the structure also applies to the many metals that show a net paramagnetic response over a broad temperature range. They do not follow a Curie type law as function of temperature however, often they are more or less temperature independent. This type of behavior is of an itinerant nature and better called Pauli-paramagnetism, but it is not unusual to see, for example, the metal [[aluminium]] called a "paramagnet", even though interactions are strong enough to give this element very good electrical conductivity.

===Superparamagnets===
Some materials show induced magnetic behavior that follows a Curie type law but with exceptionally large values for the Curie constants. These materials are known as [[superparamagnetism|superparamagnets]]. They are characterized by a strong ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic type of coupling into domains of a limited size that behave independently from one another. The bulk properties of such a system resembles that of a paramagnet, but on a microscopic level they are ordered. The materials do show an ordering temperature above which the behavior reverts to ordinary paramagnetism (with interaction). [[Ferrofluid]]s are a good example, but the phenomenon can also occur inside solids, e.g., when dilute paramagnetic centers are introduced in a strong itinerant medium of ferromagnetic coupling such as when Fe is substituted in TlCu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or the alloy AuFe. Such systems contain ferromagnetically coupled clusters that freeze out at lower temperatures. They are also called [[mictomagnetism|mictomagnets]].

'''Parasitic mass''' is a [[rocket]], [[weapon]]s and Personal Rapid Transit (PRT or PodCars) transportation term used to differentiate between the [[mass]] of the payload and the moving mass of all other components of the system. It is the mass to which force must be applied to accelerate that is not payload.

A typical [[engineering]] objective is to drive the parasitic mass towards zero. Efficiency gains are achieved as the parasitic mass is reduced.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3243">'''Planing''' is a [[manufacturing]] process of material removal in which the workpiece reciprocates against a stationary cutting tool producing a plane or sculpted surface.  Planing is analogous to shaping.  The main difference between these two processes is that in shaping the tool reciprocates across the stationary workpiece.  Planing motion is the opposite of shaping. Both planing and shaping are rapidly being replaced by [[milling_(machining)|milling]].

The mechanism used for this process is known as a [[Thickness planer|planer]]. The size of the planer is determined by the largest workpiece that can be machined on it. The cutting tools are usually carbide tipped or made of high speed steel and resemble those used in facing and [[turning]].

==Process characteristics==

==Process ==
In shaping, the tool is brought into position with the workpiece. The tool then repeatedly moves in a straight line while the workpiece is incrementally fed into the line of motion of the tool, this produces a flat, smooth, and sculpted surface. For shaped pieces the tool reciprocates across the stationary workpiece. The tools are usually tilted or lifted after each stroke. This is done hydraulically or manually in order to prevent the tool surface from chipping when the workpiece travels back across.

==Workpiece geometry==
Planing can be used to produce flat surfaces, as well as  cross-sections with grooves and notches, are produced along the length of workpiece. Shaping is basically the same as planing, except the workpiece is usually smaller, and it is the tool that moves and not the workpiece.
Planing can be used to produce horizontal, vertical, or inclined flat surfaces on workpieces usually too large for shaping. Shaping is used not only for flat surfaces, but also for external or internal surfaces (either horizontal or inclined). Curved and irregular surfaces can also be produced by using special attachments

==Setup and equipment==
Flat, angular, and contoured surfaces are made by horizontal shapers. Concerning shaping, the device that holds the piece being worked on has a very heavy movable jaw to withstand cutting forces. The size of the planer needed is determined by the workpiece.  Depending on the size of the workpiece many clamps and supporting devices may be used to hold it on the planer.

==Typical tools and geometry produced==
The tools for shaping/planing are usually made of high speed steel or carbide tipped. Except for some slight angle difference, cutting tools resemble those used in facing and turning.  Some advantages of using single-point cutting tools over multipoint tools is that they are more easily sharpened and fabricated. Internal shapes can be made by using a special extension tool.

==Material properties==
Although the most common material to be planed or shaped is wood, there are planers and shaping machines capable of processing anything from metal pieces to plastic objects.

'''Point Labatt Conservation Park''' is a [[protected area]] occupying [[Point Labatt]] on the west coast of [[Eyre Peninsula]] in [[South Australia]] about {{convert|39|km|abbr=off}} South by east of [[Streaky Bay, South Australia|Streaky Bay]].  The park was proclaimed in July 1973 under the ''[[National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972]]'' for the purpose of protecting what is considered to be ‘the largest colony of [[Australian sea lion]]s on mainland Australia’.  The park was formed on land donated in 1972 by Ron, Myra and Ellen Freeman who were concerned that ‘illegal shooting was threatening these once endangered animals.’  The [[Point Labatt Aquatic Reserve]], an associated protected area, was proclaimed in October 1988 under the ''Fisheries Act 1982'' for the purpose of protecting an area of adjoining ocean used by the colony as a feeding ground.  The conservation park is classified as an [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] [[IUCN protected area categories#Category III — Natural Monument or Feature|Category III protected area]].&lt;ref name= Charts39and41&gt;{{Citation | author1=South Australia.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2256">[[File:Pumped cut and rolled Stars.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Small samples of pumped, cut, and rolled stars.]]

'''Pyrotechnic stars''' are [[Pelletizing|pellets]] or simply pieces of pyrotechnic composition which may contain metal powders, salts or other compounds that, when ignited, burn a certain color or make a certain spark effect. They are a part of all [[projectile]]-type [[fireworks]].  The most common is the [[Aerial shell#Fireworks|aerial shell]]. When watching this firework, it will launch into the sky, burning a [[lifting charge]].  Once the shell has attained proper altitude, due to other mechanisms within the firework, it will ignite the stars.

==Procedure==
Stars are either rolled, pumped or cut.

*Rolled stars are small cores of a hard material (often lead shot or an organic material such as mustard seeds or even cut stars) which are coated in a rotating mixer similar to a [[concrete mixer]]. First some water is sprayed on cores. Then an amount of a [[pyrotechnic composition]] is dropped into the mixer. These two steps are repeated, and the stars will grow bigger and bigger into a [[spherical]] shape.
*Pumped stars are stars that have been pumped using a star pump. A dampened composition is put in the star pump and is pressed against a flat surface and ejected again, creating cylinder shaped stars.
*Cut stars is a dampened composition spread out to an even layer on a flat surface. The stars are then cut into cubes.

The stars are allowed to dry for some days before being put into the fireworks piece.

Priming the stars is often necessary because they may be hard to ignite. Priming consists of coating the surface of the star with a more easily ignited substance, such as black powder.

==Putting into use==
Stars can be used in aerial shells, [[Roman candle (firework)|Roman candles]], star mines, and certain [[bottle rocket]]s. When used in aerial shells, the stars may sometimes be required to be "primed" with an ignition coating, consisting of a pyrotechnic mixture with an ignition temperature lower than that of the star. This is usually done if the star composition does not ignite easily.

A '''Ragone plot''' (pronounced "ru-GO-nee")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.case.edu/its/archives/presidents/ragsummary.htm |title= President David V. Ragone |website= [[Case Western Reserve University]] |accessdate= 21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a plot used for performance comparison of various energy-storing devices. On such a [[chart]] the values of [[specific energy]] (in [[Watt-hour|W·h]]/[[kg]]) are plotted versus [[Power-to-weight ratio|specific power]] (in W/kg). Both axes are [[logarithmic scale|logarithmic]], which allows comparing performance of very different devices (for example, extremely high and extremely low power).

The Ragone plot was first used to compare performance of [[electric battery|batteries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|url= http://papers.sae.org/680453 |title= Review of Battery Systems for Electrically Powered Vehicles |first= D. V. |last= Ragone |journal= [[SAE International|SAE]] Technical Paper |id= 680453 |year=1968 |doi= 10.4271/680453}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is suitable to compare any energy-storing devices,&lt;ref name=Theory&gt;{{cite article |first1= Thomas |last= Christen |first2= Martin W. |last2= Carlen |year= 2000 |url= https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229122460_Theory_of_Ragone_plots |title= Theory of Ragone plots |journal= [[Journal of Power Sources]] |volume= 91 |issue= 2 |pages= 210&amp;ndash;216 |doi= 10.1016/S0378-7753(00)00474-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as is shown in the graph on the right.  The plot is named after [[David V. Ragone]].&lt;ref name=Theory /&gt;

Conceptually, the vertical axis describes how much [[energy]] is available, while the horizontal axis shows how quickly that energy can be delivered, otherwise known as [[Power (physics)|power]], per unit mass. A point in a Ragone plot thus represents the amount of time during which the energy (per mass) on the Y-axis can be delivered at the power (per mass) on the X-axis, and that time (in hours) is given as the ratio between the energy and the power densities. Consequently, the [[contour line|iso curves]] in a Ragone plot are straight lines with unity [[slope]]. For example, powering a small light bulb may require low amounts of power, but the power should be delivered steadily enough to operate a [[flashlight]] for minutes or hours of use.  Conversely, a high-speed [[transistor|electronic switch]] inside a [[computer]] may require very little energy to activate; yet it must be delivered rapidly enough to complete the transaction in mere [[microsecond]]s.  These two types of loads would be represented at opposite corners of the Ragone plot.{{Clarify|date=August 2017|reason=example plot does not show iso lines, "for example" example speaks of "loads", which are not ESDs, appearing on plot}}

:&lt;math&gt;\text{Specific Energy} = \frac{V \times I \times t}m,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\text{Specific Power} = \frac{V \times I}m,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''V'' is [[voltage]] (V), ''I'' [[electric current]] (A), ''t'' [[time]] (s) and ''m'' [[mass]] (kg).

'''Rickshaw art''' or '''auto art''' is a form of [[neo-romanticism]] emerging in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. 

The art in question consists of [[oil painting]]s on the rear of the canvas roof of [[rickshaw]]s, done by local street artists, who also paint the various landscape, portraits and personal statements of the driver.

== History ==
In Bangladesh, rickshaw art dates back to the 1950s and every conceivable part of the rickshaw is painted. In addition to geometric designs, there are depictions of flowers, birds and even popular actresses. The rickshaw can be decorated to show the driver's religious beliefs and sometimes even a commentary on current social issues.&lt;ref&gt;RickshawArt.org [http://www.rickshawart.org''Website of the social entreprise RickshawArt in Bangladesh.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170422102750/http://www.rickshawart.org/ |date=2017-04-22 }} Dhaka.&lt;/ref&gt; In Bangladesh, rickshaw art is looked down upon by the elite population.&lt;ref name="world"&gt;{{cite book|last=Marshall Cavendish Corporation|title=World and Its Peoples: Eastern and Southern Asia|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|year=2007|pages=479|isbn=0-7614-7631-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5ZBaVhmRvCkC&amp;pg=PA479&amp;dq=rickshaw+art&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;cd=4#v=onepage&amp;q=rickshaw%20art&amp;f=false|accessdate=March 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three-wheeled pedicab, more commonly known as the [[rickshaw]], has been around since the 1940s. Initially, they were undecorated, but starting in the late 1940s, the faces of movie stars began appearing as decorative motifs on shields at the back of the rickshaws along with a variety of floral paintings. The unique trend of rickshaw art started from [[Rajshahi]] and [[Dhaka]] in Bangladesh and took its own style in each district. For instance, [[Chittagong]] being a more pious city then Dhaka mostly had floral or scenery art whereas Comilla has plain rickshaws with beautiful dark blue or green hoods, on which are sewn an appliqué of a minaret or floral design enshrining the word "Allah".{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

Artwork on the wheels of the rickshaws are done using very bold, bright and raw colours, like fluorescent green, dark red and so on. The blaze of colours also help to make them long lasting. 

Author Joanna Kirkpatrick states her definition of rickshaw art: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;I consider it "peoples' art". It is not necessary to force it into a unitary category as it combines folkloric, movie, political and commercial imagery and techniques. It serves the expression of heart's desires of the man in the street for women, power, wealth, as well as for religious devotion. Rickshaw art also serves prestige and economic functions for the people who make, use and enjoy it.&lt;ref&gt;Joanna Kirkpatrick. [http://www.asianart.com/articles/ricksha/index.html ''Rickshaw Art in Bangladesh.''] Asian Art.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rickshaw art also reflects the [[economic globalization]] process, which is occurring all over the world today, for instance those rickshaws with Osama Bin Laden's pictures. Rickshaws are not only painted but also decorated with tassels, tinsel and colourful plastic.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

Rickshaw art covers the whole rickshaw decoration, from painted backboards and rear side panels to cut-outs appliquéd on to hoods, as well as brass vases replete with plastic or paper flowers. The painted rectangular metal board at the backside, between the two wheels, leaves a trail of passion that the Rickshaw artist puts in his creations.&lt;ref&gt;RickshawArt.org [http://www.rickshawart.org''Website of the social entreprise RickshawArt in Bangladesh.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170422102750/http://www.rickshawart.org/ |date=2017-04-22 }} Dhaka.&lt;/ref&gt;

This living pop art in Bangladesh is primarily created by illiterate rickshaw artists. They learn their techniques by living with Ustat (masters) from boyhood. They do not have copyrights, and in most cases are not attributed by name on their art. In the back of rickshaws however, there is generally a mark of the maker indicated by a bold steel pin, for example - "Fazlu Mistri". Today, rickshaw art and artists are in a 'struggle of existence'. Third and fourth generations are increasingly less interested in learning the art due to low incomes of two to three dollars a day as well as the lack of recognition.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

== Biskut Factory == 

As the genre of hand painted objects are dying down due to screen printing and other such technologies, a Bangladeshi artist called Biskut Abir, started his own art firm called Biskut Factory where he brought back rickshaw art and promoted it by hand painting on modern, innovative products. He uses patterns and colors from Rickshaw art and paints these vibrant images on sunglasses, clothes, shoes, phone cases and almost anything with a surface. His establishment is built on an artsy spirit and his love for rebelling against the system. Biskut lacks an academic background on designing or art, but has quite successfully proven that they can be redundant when talent persists. 

By selling and advertising his eye catching art through social media, Biskut has been extremely successful in amusing the youth and bringing back rickshaw art with a twist of modern art.

Kimmel and his wife Caroline bought [[Johnny Carson]]'s former estate. They purchased the property that sits on the Point Dume promontory in Malibu, California in 2007 for $46 million.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.townandcountrymag.com/leisure/real-estate/g13052495/johnny-carson-malibu-house/], accessed Aug 21, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2017, they placed the property up for sale for $81.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.today.com/home/johnny-carson-s-malibu-estate-sale-see-inside-t117394], accessed Aug 21, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; They reduced the price to $65.2 million in August of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/business/realestate/hot-property/la-fi-hotprop-johnny-carson-kimmel-malibu-price-chop-20180809-story.html], accessed Aug 21, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Kimmel founded [[Jones Apparel Group]] in 1970 while working at [[W.R. Grace and Company|W.&amp;nbsp;R.&amp;nbsp;Grace and Company]]. Five years later, he purchased the company with a partner. Notable lines produced by Kimmel include Jones New York, Evan-Picone, and [[9 West]]; he also has licensing deals with [[Ralph Lauren Corporation|Ralph Lauren]]. He stepped down as chief executive officer of Jones in 2002 and sold most of his shares in the publicly traded company, but remained chairman of the board of directors until the sale of the company to Sycamore Partners in 2014. He owns art, real estate, a film production company [[Sidney Kimmel Entertainment]], and a small stake in the professional [[NBA]] basketball team [[Miami Heat]].&lt;ref name=Forbes1014 /&gt;

===Sidney Kimmel Entertainment===
Founded in 2004, Sidney Kimmel Entertainment (SKE) is a Los Angeles-based production, finance and distribution company headed by Kimmel. Films produced include SKE and [[Screen Gems]]' 2010 remake ''[[Death at a Funeral (2010 film)|Death at a Funeral]]'', ''[[The Kite Runner (film)|The Kite Runner]]'' (2007), ''[[United 93 (film)|United&amp;nbsp;93]]'', ''[[Breach (film)|Breach]]'', ''[[Lars and the Real Girl]]'', [[Adventureland (film)|''Adventureland'']], ''[[Death at a Funeral (2007 film)|Death at a Funeral]]'', ''[[Synecdoche, New York]]'', ''[[Gone (2012 film)|Gone]]'' (2012), ''[[The Place Beyond the Pines]]'' (2012) and ''[[The Age of Adaline]]''.

==Philanthropy==
Kimmel is an active philanthropist with an emphasis on healthcare, education, arts and culture. His goal is to donate $1&amp;nbsp;billion in total throughout his lifetime.&lt;ref name="BJ"&gt;[http://www.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/stories/2003/04/14/focus3.html?t=printable The $1&amp;nbsp;billion man]. [[Philadelphia Business Journal]], accessed December 28, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FOP"&gt;[http://www.facesofphilanthropy.com/sidney-kimmel/ Sidney Kimmel's Philanthropy page]. [[Faces of Philanthropy]], accessed December 28, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, Kimmel founded the [[Sidney Kimmel Foundation]]. The foundation's Cancer Research division pledged to contribute $120&amp;nbsp;million to institutions serving healthcare, education, arts and culture. Later, in 2001, the Sidney Kimmel Foundation for Cancer Research donated $150&amp;nbsp;million to [[Johns Hopkins University]]. The donation became the largest single gift ever received by the University, and was directed toward the development of a residence for cancer patients undergoing extended treatment. The gift inspired the university to name the residence the [[Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center]]. In total Kimmel has his name attached to four separate cancer-research centers in Philadelphia, San Diego and Baltimore.&lt;ref name="BJ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FOP"/&gt; The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]]&lt;ref name=AboutSidneyKimmel /&gt; as well as the Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center at [[Thomas Jefferson University Hospital]] carry his name. The Jefferson Medical College was renamed the Sidney Kimmel Medical College of [[Thomas Jefferson University]] in June 2014, following a $110 million grant from the Sidney Kimmel Foundation, the fifth-largest ever gift to a medical school.&lt;ref name=tjugift&gt;[http://www.philly.com/philly/business/20140618_Sidney_Kimmel_donates__110M_to_Jefferson.html "Kimmel donates $110M to Jefferson" - Philadelphia Inquirer 18-Jun-2014]&lt;/ref&gt; As of April 2003, Kimmel and the Sidney Kimmel Foundation had donated an estimated $400&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="BJ"/&gt;

Kimmel has also contributed over $35 million&lt;ref name="BJ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FOP"/&gt; to the center for the performing arts in Philadelphia, which is now named The [[Kimmel Center for the Performing Arts]] and is home to the world-renowned [[Philadelphia Orchestra]]. Other contributions from Kimmel include a $5&amp;nbsp;million donation to The [[National Constitution Center]] in Philadelphia; a $20&amp;nbsp;million donation to [[Raymond and Ruth Perelman Jewish Day School]] in Philadelphia and $25&amp;nbsp;million for the establishment of a new prostate and urological cancer center at [[Memorial Sloan-Kettering]] in New York.&lt;ref name="FOP"/&gt; In 2003 Kimmel pledged $25&amp;nbsp;million to The [[National Museum of American Jewish History]] in Philadelphia. The construction was said to have cost in total $100&amp;nbsp;million, and opened in 2006 on the museum's existing site facing Independence Mall.&lt;ref name="BJ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FOP"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nmajh.org/content.aspx?id=152&amp;terms=Sidney+Kimmel Announcements]. [[National Museum of American Jewish History]], accessed on December 28, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Kimmel donated $25&amp;nbsp;million to [[Stand Up To Cancer]].

==Support for cold fusion research==
Kimmel has given $5.5&amp;nbsp;million to the [[University of Missouri]] to create the Sidney Kimmel Institute for Nuclear Renaissance, SKINR, where researchers will ''"figure out why excess heat has been observed when [[hydrogen]] or [[deuterium]] interacts with materials such as [[palladium]], [[nickel]] or [[platinum]] under extreme conditions."'', Originally named "[[cold fusion]]," nowadays the name [[low-energy nuclear reaction]] (LENR) is also used.&lt;ref name=SKINR&gt;[http://www.columbiatribune.com/news/2012/feb/10/billionaire-helps-fund-mu-energy-research/ "Billionaire helps fund MU energy research" - Columbia Tribune 10-Feb-2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''St. Mary Magdalene's flood''' (German: ''Magdalenenhochwasser'') was the largest-recorded [[flood]] in [[central Europe]]&lt;ref&gt;Without taking the storm surges on the North Sea coasts into account&lt;/ref&gt; with water levels exceeding those of the [[2002 European floods]]. It occurred in July 1342 on and around the feast day of [[Mary Magdalene|St. Mary Magdalene]], 22 July.

Following the passage of a [[Genoa low]] the rivers [[Rhine]], [[Moselle (river)|Moselle]], [[Main (river)|Main]], [[Danube]], [[Weser]], [[Werra]], [[Unstrut]], [[Elbe River|Elbe]], [[Vltava]] and their tributaries inundated large areas. Many towns such as [[Cologne]], [[Mainz]], [[Frankfurt|Frankfurt am Main]], [[Würzburg]], [[Regensburg]], [[Passau]] and [[Vienna]] were seriously damaged. Even the river [[Eider (river)|Eider]] north of [[Hamburg]] flooded the surrounding land. The affected area extended to [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]] and northern [[Italy]].

It appears that after a prolonged hot and dry period continuous rainfalls occurred which lasted several consecutive days and amounted to more than half of the mean yearly precipitation. Since the dry soil was unable to absorb such amounts of water, the [[surface runoff]] washed away large areas of fertile soil and caused huge inundations destroying houses, mills and bridges. In Würzburg, the then famous ''Steinerne Brücke'' (''Stone Bridge'') was taken away and in Cologne it is said that a rowing boat could pass over the city's fortifications. The overall number of casualties is not known, but it is believed that alone in the Danube area 6,000 people were killed. The results of the erosion can still be noticed today. The volume of the eroded soil during this short incident (a few days) is determined to be more than 13 billion [[Tonne|metric tons]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =Bork | first =Hans-Rudolf | author-link =Hans-Rudolf Bork | last2 =Piorr | first2 =Hans-Peter | author2-link =Hans-Peter Piorr | title =Innovative Ansätze zum Schutz der Natur: Visionen für die Zukunft | editor-last =Erdmann | editor-first =Karl-Heinz  | editor2-last =Mager | editor2-first =Thomas J. | place = | publisher =Springer | year =2000 | chapter =Integrierte Konzepte zum Schutz und zur dauerhaft-naturverträglichen Entwicklung mitteleuropäischer Landschaften – Chancen und Risiken, dargestellt am Beispiel des Boden- und Gewässerschutzes | pages =71–72 | language =de | isbn =978-3540666677 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a volume that is washed away under normal climate conditions over a period of 2,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last =| first =| author-link =| last2 =| first2 =| author2-link =| title =Das verflixte "Genua-Tief"| publisher =[[Neue Zürcher Zeitung]]| date =2008-08-25| year =| url =http://www.nzz.ch/2005/08/25/il/articleD31CG.html| access-date =2016-02-12| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20111230134322/http://www.nzz.ch/2005/08/25/il/articleD31CG.html| archivedate =2011-12-30| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is assumed that the loss of fertile soil led to a serious drop in agricultural production. In addition, the following summers were wet and cold, so that the population suffered from widespread famine. Whether the spreading of the [[Black Death]] between 1348 and 1350 killing at least a third of the population in central Europe was facilitated by the weakened condition of the population is a matter of discussion.

'''SymbioCity''' is the [[trademark]]ed term for [[Sweden]]'s approach to sustainable [[urban development]].&lt;ref name="urbantrekker"/&gt; Established in 2008, the program's primary goal is to export Sweden's knowledge and experience with sustainable cities.&lt;ref name="MIPIM 2010"&gt;{{cite conference

[[Gunnar Lund]], Swedish ambassador to [[France]], said in 2010, "The starting point for SymbioCity is the predicted growth of our population from six billion to nine billion in the next two decades".&lt;ref name="MIPIM 2010"/&gt;

SymbioCity aims to "get more for less", creating [[synergy]] by integrating different technologies and city functions.&lt;ref name=urbantrekker&gt;{{cite web

For example, waste can turn into energy, waste water can turn into fuel, and the excessive heat from an industry can warm up a household. According to the SymbioCity approach, environmental and economic gains result from unlocking synergies between urban systems. The seven building blocks of SymbioCity are: [[Architecture]]; [[Energy]]; [[Landscape planning|Landscape Planning]]; Traffic &amp; Transport; [[Waste Management]]; Urban Functions, Industry and Buildings; Water Supply and Sanitation. Several hundred Swedish consultants, contractors and system suppliers are connected to SymbioCity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The '''Upper Tamakoshi Hydroelectric Project''' is a 456 MW [[Peaking power plant|peaking]] [[Run-of-the-river hydroelectricity|run-of-the-river]] [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] project in Nepal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://utkhpl.org.np/information/8|title=Salient Features|website=utkhpl.org.np|access-date=2017-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; It the largest hydroelectric project in Nepal, and is slated for completion in 2018.&lt;ref name=hydroworld2015/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://kathmandupost.ekantipur.com/news/2016-12-22/completion-deadline-pushed-back-again.html|title=Upper Tamakoshi project: Completion deadline pushed back again|access-date=2017-02-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is sited on the Tamakoshi River (also spelled Tamba Koshi), a tributary of the [[Sun Kosi]] river (also spelled Sunkoshi), near the Nepal–Tibet border.

The Upper Tamakoshi Hydroelectric Project is a Nepal national priority project. When it is completed, it is projected be the largest hydroelectric plant in Nepal, with a power output equivalent to two-thirds of Nepal's current power generation.&lt;ref name=hydroworld2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=kpost2013/&gt; The Project is entirely financed from domestic financial institutions and companies.

==Financing and organization==
[[Nepal Electricity Authority]] (NEA) has established an autonomous company named Upper Tamakoshi Hydropower Limited (UTKHPL) in March 2007 (2063/11/25 B.S.) as an executing agency for the implementation of the Project. There are six full-time and two invitee members in the Board of Directors (BoD) at present. Out of six full-time members, four members from NEA, one from Employees Provident Fund (EPF) and one from Nepal Telecom (NTC) are representing in the BoD. Similarly, representatives of Citizen Investment Trust (CIT) and Rastriya Beema Sansthan (RBS) are also in the BoD as invitee members.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The majority share (51%) of the Company is held by four public entities, namely, Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA), Nepal Telecom (NTC), Citizen Investment Trust (CIT) and Rastriya Beema Sansthan (RBS). NEA has 41% stake, NTC has 6% and CIT &amp; RBS each has 2% stake in the Company. Similarly, general public and residents of Dolakha District will have 15% and 10% share respectively. The remaining 24% share will be taken over by contributors in Employees Provident Fund (EPF), NEA &amp; Companys staffs and staffs of financial institutions providing loans.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://utkhpl.org.np/information/2|title=About Tamakoshi Hydro|website=utkhpl.org.np|access-date=2017-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
[[File:Upper Tamakoshi Access Tunnel.jpg|thumb|Upper Tamakoshi Access Tunnel]]
Construction began in February 2011. [[Sinohydro]] is managing construction.&lt;ref name=SNS2012/&gt; The Nepalese Army was mobilized to provide security to the site in 2012, after it was reportedly threatened by vandalism and threats to construction staff and foreign workers.&lt;ref name=kp2012/&gt; Work was disrupted by the [[April 2015 Nepal earthquake]], after which over 200 Chinese workers were evacuated.&lt;ref name=hydroworld2015/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Nearly 200 Chinese workers stranded but safe in hydropower project construction site in quake-hit Nepal|publisher=Xinhua News Agency|date=2015-05-03|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2015-05/03/c_134205939.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Work was disrupted throughout the construction project by labor strikes.&lt;ref name=HW2015/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Works Resume at Upper Tamakoshi|newspaper=The Kathmandu Post|date=March 31, 2015|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-3639801941.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earthquake also caused damage to roads and bridges and buried the troop barracks at the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Upper Tamakoshi Project in crisis as staff, contractor do not return |url= http://myrepublica.com/economy/story/24857/upper-tamakoshi-project-in-crisis-as-staff-contractor-do-not-return.html|newspaper=[[República (Nepalese newspaper)|República]]|date=July 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May, 2018, it was reported that the planned July completion date could be jeopardized by late assembly of the turbomachinery that had been delivered to the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=New consultant to be hired for Upper Tamakoshi|date=May 10, 2018|publisher=Online Khabar|location=Khatmandu|url=http://english.onlinekhabar.com/new-consultant-to-be-hired-for-upper-tamakoshi.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in May, the country's finance minister said that the project was expected to contribute to robust national economic growth in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Khatiwada Dispels Doubts on 8pc Growth|newspaper=[[The Kathmandu Post]]|date=May 31, 2018|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P4-2046929384.html|via=[[HighBeam]] {{subscription required}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Infrastructure===
Infrastructure for the plant includes a 142&amp;nbsp;m long, 25&amp;nbsp;m high underground powerhouse hall near Gongar Khola, with six [[Pelton wheel]]s; a 22&amp;nbsp;m high × 60&amp;nbsp;m wide dam; a 360&amp;nbsp;m high surge shaft; and a total of 16&amp;nbsp;km of headrace and tailrace tunnels.&lt;ref name=hydroworld2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=kpost2013/&gt; The gross head will be 822&amp;nbsp;m.&lt;ref name=hydroworld2015/&gt;

[[File:Public Garbage Bin in Nacka.jpg|thumb|Public waste container in Sweden]]
A '''waste container''' is a [[container]] for temporarily storing waste, and is usually made out of [[metal]] or [[plastic]]. Some common terms are '''dustbin'''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.csb.gov.hk/hkgcsb/glossary/glossary_search_en.php?search_name1=dustbin&lt;/ref&gt;, '''garbage can''', and '''trash can'''. The words "rubbish", "basket" and "bin" are more common in British English usage; "trash" and "can" are more common in American English usage.  "Garbage" may refer to [[food waste]] specifically (when distinguished from "trash") or to [[municipal solid waste]] in general. In 1875, the first household rubbish bins were introduced in Britain to create a regulated system of collection.

== Public waste collection ==
In many cities and towns, there is a public waste collection service which regularly collects household waste from outside buildings etc. This will be loaded into a [[garbage truck]] and driven to a [[landfill]], [[incinerator]] or crush facility to be disposed of. Household waste containers are usually either: 
* trash cans, receptacles made of metal or plastic
* wheelie bins, light, mobile plastic bins&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smyth|first1=Sara|title=Councils to reduce size of wheelie bins by almost half for 6 million households in bid to cut expenses and meet recycling targets|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2539639/Councils-reduce-size-wheelie-bins-50-6million-households-bid-cut-expenses-meet-recycling-targets.html|accessdate=16 August 2015|work=Mail Online [[Daily Mail]]|publisher=Associated Newspapers|date=15 January 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150922002050/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2539639/Councils-reduce-size-wheelie-bins-50-6million-households-bid-cut-expenses-meet-recycling-targets.html|archivedate=22 September 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some areas, each household has multiple bins for different categories of rubbish (usually represented by colours) depending on its suitability for [[recycling]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ccc.govt.nz/services/rubbish-and-recycling/ "Rubbish and recycling"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160612123209/http://www.ccc.govt.nz/services/rubbish-and-recycling |date=2016-06-12 }}, ccc.govt.nz&lt;/ref&gt;

Commercial roadside waste containers are often larger [[Dumpster|dumpsters]] or [[skip (container)|skip]]s.

== Public litter bins ==

Public areas, such as [[parks]], often have [[litter]] bins placed to improve the [[social environment]] by encouraging people not to [[littering|litter]]. Such bins in outdoor locations or other busy [[public]] areas are usually mounted to the ground or wall to discourage [[theft]], and reduce [[vandalism]], and to [[beautification|improve their appearance]] are sometimes deliberately artistic or cute. In dense urban areas, trash is stored underground below the receptacle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Shendruk |first1=Amanada |title=Could NYC solve its trash problem with underground trash cans? |url=https://qz.com/1329108/sensor-enabled-trash-bins-could-help-nyc-solve-its-waste-problem/ |accessdate=5 September 2018 |work=[[Quartz (publication)]] |date=5 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some trash cans have plastic bags to help contain liquids.

== Metaphors ==

The term "garbage can" is also used for a model of decision making, the "[[Garbage Can Model]]" of decision making. It is concerned with cases of decision making in great aggregate uncertainty which can cause decisions to arise that from a distant point of view might seem irrational. 

A "[[Recycle bin (computing)|trash can]]" metaphor is often used in computer operating system desktop environments as a place files can be moved for deletion. 

In a workplace setting, a bin may be euphemistically called "the [[circular file]]", "the [[File 13|round file]]" or "the janitor's file".  Whereas useful documents are filed in a [[filing cabinet]], which is rectangular, junk mail and other worthless items are "filed" in the bin, which is often round.
