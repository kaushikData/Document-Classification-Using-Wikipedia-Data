      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4755">A '''999-year lease''', under historic [[common law]], is an essentially permanent [[lease]] of property. The lease locations are mainly in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], its former colonies, and the [[Commonwealth]].

A former colony, the Republic of [[Mauritius]] (''The Raphael Fishing Company Ltd v. The State of Mauritius &amp; Anor'' (Mauritius) [2008] UKPC 43 (30 July 2008)) established legal precedent on 30 July 2008 in respect of a 'permanent lease' on [[St. Brandon]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lexpress.mu/article/le-bail-permanent-de-rapha%C3%ABl-fishing-confirm%C3%A9-sur-st-brandon Le bail permanent de Raphaël Fishing confirmé sur St.-Brandon]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saflii.org/mu/cases/UKPC/2008/43.html Privy Council Judgment 30 July 2008 - Raphaël Fishing Company Ltd.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Agence française de sécurité sanitaire des produits de santé==
[[File:Agence française de sécurité sanitaire des produits de santé (logo).svg|thumb|right|Logo of the Agence française de sécurité sanitaire des produits de santé]]
The '''Agence française de sécurité sanitaire des produits de santé''' ('''French Agency for the Safety of Health Products'''), often abbreviated AFSSAPS or AFSSaPS, was a [[French government]] institution whose main mission was to assess health risks posed by health products intended for human consumption, particularly [[pharmaceutical drug]]s. It was responsible for issuing permits for marketing approval and became the single authority in the regulation of biomedical research.

The agency was latest headed by [[Dominique Maraninchi]] and had about 1,000 employees plus 2,000 experts. Its budget amounts to approximately 157 million euros, with the bulk of revenue came from taxes and charges levied on the activity of the pharmaceutical industry.

The Agence Nationale de Sécurité du Médicament et des Produits de Santé (ANSM), superseded the tasks and duties of the AFSSAPS on 1 May 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ansm.sante.fr/L-ANSM2/Une-agence-d-expertise/L-ANSM-agence-d-evaluation-d-expertise-et-de-decision/(offset)/0 |title=L'ANSM, agence d'évaluation, d'expertise et de décision - ANSM : Agence nationale de sécurité du médicament et des produits de santé |language=fr |publisher=Ansm.sante.fr |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Archibald Constable.jpg|thumb|Lithograph of Archibald Constable published in ''A History of Booksellers, the Old and the New''.]]
'''Archibald David Constable''' (24 February 1774 – 21 July 1827) was a Scottish publisher, bookseller and stationer.

==Life==
Constable was born at [[Carnbee Parish, Scotland|Carnbee]], [[Fife]], son of the land steward to the [[Earl of Kellie]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=981}}

In 1788 Archibald was apprenticed to Peter Hill, an [[Edinburgh]] bookseller, but in 1795 he started in business for himself as a dealer in rare books. He bought the ''Scots Magazine'' in 1801, and [[John Leyden]], the orientalist, became its editor. In 1800 Constable began the ''Farmer's Magazine'', and in November 1802 he issued the first number of the ''[[Edinburgh Review]]'', under the nominal editorship of [[Sydney Smith]]; Lord Jeffrey, was, however, the guiding spirit of the review, having as his associates [[Henry Peter Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux|Lord Brougham]], Sir [[Walter Scott]], [[Henry Hallam]], [[John Playfair]] and afterwards [[Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay|Lord Macaulay]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=981}}

Constable made a new departure in publishing by the generosity of his terms to authors. Writers for the ''Edinburgh Review'' were paid at an unprecedented rate, and Constable offered Scott 1000 guineas in advance for ''[[Marmion (poem)|Marmion]]''. In 1804 [[A. G. Hunter]] joined Constable as partner, bringing considerable capital into the firm, styled from that time Archibald Constable &amp; Co. In 1805, jointly with [[Longman &amp; Co.]], Constable published Scott's ''[[The Lay of the Last Minstrel|Lay of the Last Minstrel]]'', and in 1807 ''Marmion''.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=981}}

In 1808 a split took place between Constable and Sir Walter Scott, who transferred his business to the publishing firm of [[John Ballantyne (publisher)|John Ballantyne]] &amp; Co., for which he supplied most of the capital. In 1813, however, a reconciliation took place. Ballantyne was in difficulties, and Constable again became Scott's publisher, a condition being that the firm of John Ballantyne &amp; Co. should be wound up at an early date, though Scott retained his interest in the printing business of James Ballantyne &amp; Co.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=981}}

In 1808 he served as Moderator of the High Constables of Edinburgh.&lt;ref&gt;List of Moderators of the High Constables of Edonburgh, Edinburgh City Chambers&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1812 Constable, who had admitted [[Robert Cathcart]] and [[Robert Cadell]] as partners on Hunter's retirement, purchased the [[copyright]] of the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', adding the supplement (6 vols, 1816-1824) to the 4th, 5th and 6th editions. In 1814 he bought the copyright of ''[[Waverley (novel)|Waverley]]''. This was issued anonymously; but in a short time 12,000&lt;!--Gutenburg edition states 12,200 but the internet archive OCR and the different Wikisource OCR indicate that it is 12,000--&gt;  copies were disposed of, Scott's other novels following in quick succession.  The firm also published the ''Annual Register''.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=981}}

Through over-speculation, complications arose, and in 1826 a crash came. Constable's London agents stopped payment, and he failed for over £250,000, while James Ballantyne &amp; Co. also went bankrupt for nearly £90,000. [[Sir Walter Scott]] was affected by the failure of both firms.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=981}}

Constable started business afresh, and began in 1827 ''[[Constable's Miscellany of Original and Selected Works]]'' consisting of a series of original works, and of standard books republished in a cheap form, thus making one of the earliest and most famous attempts to popularize high-quality literature. {{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=981}}

[[File:Grave of Archibald Constable, Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|Constable's grave in the [[Old Calton Burying Ground]] in Edinburgh]]
Constable died at home, 3 Park Place&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh Post Office directory 1827&lt;/ref&gt; in Edinburgh, on 21 July 1827,&lt;ref&gt;''Archibald Constable and his Literary Correspondents'', by his son Thomas Constable (3 vols., 1873). This book contains numerous contemporary notices of Archibald Constable, and vindicates him from the exaggeration of J. G. Lockhart and others {{harv|Chisholm|1911|p=982}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but his firm survived,{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=981}} and the Constable publishing business continued in the twentieth century, issuing a wide range of fiction and non-fiction books. It continues today as [[Constable &amp; Robinson]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Park Place was a small square north of [[George Square, Edinburgh|Geoge Square]] which was demolished later in the 19th century to build the new medical buildings for [[Edinburgh University]].&lt;ref&gt;https://maps.nls.uk/view/74415500&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Constable was married to Mary Willison. They lived in Craigcrook House in western Edinburgh.{{sfn|Waterston|Shearer|2010|p=200}}

Their son, [[Thomas Constable]] [[FRSE]] (1812-1881) took over his printing business on his father's death. In 1839 he was appointed printer and publisher in Edinburgh to [[Queen Victoria]], and issued, among other notable series, ''Constable's Educational Series'', and ''Constable's Foreign Miscellany''. In 1865 his son Archibald David Constable (died 1915) became a partner, and when Thomas retired in 1893 the firm continued under the name of T. &amp; A. Constable.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=982}}{{sfn|Waterston|Shearer|2010|pp=199–200}}

Thomas married Lucia Anne Cowan, daughter of [[Alexander Cowan]] paper-maker (who clearly would have had business links with a major publishing firm such as Constables).&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary of National Biography: Thomas Constable&lt;/ref&gt; They lived at 11 Thistle Street in [[New Town, Edinburgh|Edinburgh's First New Town]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S008045680002648X|title=List of the Ordinary Fellows of the Society|date=1 January 1870|publisher=|volume=26|issue=01|pages=xi–xiii|via=Cambridge Journals Online|doi=10.1017/S008045680002648X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their son was also Archibald David Constable [[FRSE]] LLD (1843-1915), named after his grandfather, and followed in the family tradition as a printer.

His daughter, Elizabeth Constable (d.1818) married his junior publishing partner, [[Robert Cadell]] of [[Ratho]].&lt;ref&gt;Monuments and monumental inscriptions in Scotland: The Grampian Society, 1871&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Avaloq''' is a Swiss company that develops and provides software for [[core banking]]. The software system, '''Avaloq Banking Suite''', is used by more than 140 banks worldwide.&lt;ref name="bbchs"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smale|first1=Will|title=High security: The man who protects our bank accounts|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-38800176|website=BBC News|accessdate=7 February 2017|date=6 February 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170207000336/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-38800176|archivedate=7 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Core banking is the activity, at the heart of any bank, that deals with information about customers, transactions and account balances. Banks have traditionally bought in software for these purposes rather than developing it internally. More and more functions have had to be added over the years as requirements have changed, for example for online banking. The result has been very complex computer programs that can be difficult to manage. Also,  coding changes for compliance to new regulations and for accommodating new products can be problematic.&lt;ref name="abank"&gt;{{cite web|title=Can Big Four Core Banking Vendors' Oligopoly Be Broken?|url=https://www.americanbanker.com/news/can-big-four-core-banking-vendors-oligopoly-be-broken|website=American Banker|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.americanbanker.com%2Fnews%2Fcan-big-four-core-banking-vendors-oligopoly-be-broken&amp;date=2017-02-07|first1=Penny|last1=Crosman|date=7 October 2013|archivedate=7 February 2017|deadurl=no|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, banks have tended to buy in modern comprehensive software from large, specialist firms. This may be run by the bank itself or by an agency running the computing service on behalf of the bank.&lt;ref name=abank /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Eckert|first1=Martin|title=Swiss Banking Software Goes Worldwide|url=http://www.worlditlawyers.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Swiss-Banking-Software-goes-worldwide_Martin_Eckert_MME-Partners2.pdf|website=worlditlawyers.com|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.worlditlawyers.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2011%2F06%2FSwiss-Banking-Software-goes-worldwide_Martin_Eckert_MME-Partners2.pdf&amp;date=2017-02-07|archivedate=7 February 2017|pages=20-21|date=June 2011|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Company history==
Avaloq was founded in Zurich in 1985, under the name "BZ Informatik Aktiengesellschaft", functioning as the [[information technology]] subsidiary of {{ill|BZ Bank|de}}. In 1991, 30% of the share capital was taken by the employees as a result of a partial [[management buyout]]. At that time there were five staff and the cost of the buyout was $200,000.&lt;ref name=bbchs /&gt;

The first customer was [[Swiss National Bank]], rapidly followed by five other commercial banks in Switzerland. The system then spread worldwide although it has had little impact in America.&lt;ref name=bbchs /&gt;&lt;ref name=abank /&gt; Initially the firm was called BZ Informatik, and its product “AdvAntAge”.

In 1996 the current name was adopted.&lt;ref name="avaloqhistory"&gt;{{cite web|title=History – Avaloq|url=https://www.avaloq.co.uk/about-us/history/|website=www.avaloq.co.uk|publisher=Avaloq|accessdate=7 February 2017|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.avaloq.co.uk%2Fabout-us%2Fhistory%2F&amp;date=2017-02-07|archivedate=7 February 2017|language=en|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001 the company split from BZ Bank, as the employees acquired 100% of the share capital.

==Current activities==

Avaloq Banking Group AG employs 2,500 staff, 500 of which are programmers. It has annual revenues of over $500 million and its software accounts for bank deposits to the sum of $4 trillion.&lt;ref name=bbchs /&gt; The founder and chairman is Francisco Fernandez.&lt;ref name=bbchs /&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Management Team – Avaloq|url=https://www.avaloq.co.uk/about-us/our-management-team/|website=www.avaloq.co.uk|publisher=Avaloq|accessdate=7 February 2017|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170208032929/https://www.avaloq.co.uk/about-us/our-management-team/|archivedate=8 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Avaloq Banking Suite software is used by over 450 customers including [[HSBC]], [[Barclays]], [[Royal Bank of Scotland]], [[UBS]], [[Deutsche Bank]], [[Nomura]] and [[Societe Generale]].&lt;ref name=bbchs /&gt; Some of the customers have performed [[business process outsourcing]] to Avaloq itself for the actual running of the core computing service which uses [[cloud computing]].&lt;ref name=bbchs /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Minetti|first1=Maurizio|title=Bankensoftware: Avaloq greift nach der Krone aloq greift nach der Krone|url=http://www.inside-it.ch/articles/15852|website=inside-it.ch|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.inside-it.ch%2Farticles%2F15852&amp;date=2017-02-07|archivedate=7 February 2017|date=23 October 2008|language=de|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pütter|first1=Christiane|title=Business Process Outsourcing Avaloq und Quirin Bank rollen BPO-Markt auf|url=http://www.cio.de/a/avaloq-und-quirin-bank-rollen-bpo-markt-auf,2903921|website=www.cio.de|publisher=CIO|accessdate=7 February 2017|language=de|date=14 January 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160309042201/http://www.cio.de/a/avaloq-und-quirin-bank-rollen-bpo-markt-auf%2C2903921|archivedate=9 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The security of the data stored by the system is of the utmost importance. To guard against [[cyber attack]] the firm engages a number of companies based in Israel to attempt to break through the security systems and then help plug the weaknesses uncovered.&lt;ref name=bbchs /&gt;

'''Basil El-Baz''' is an Egyptian [[industrialist]], [[entrepreneur]] and business executive serving as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Carbon Holdings, a mid-to-downstream oil and gas development company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=98342239 "Company Overview of Carbon Holdings"] ''Bloomberg Businessweek''. Retrieved 2014-7-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

While studying government and economics at [[Harvard University]], El-Baz developed the concept for building an ammonia plant in Egypt, which ultimately became [http://www.orascom.com/our-capabilities/case-studies/egypt-basic-industries-corporation-ebic/ Egypt Basic Industries Corporation (EBIC]). He submitted a feasibility study on this concept and was awarded a grant by the United States Trade and Development Agency to conduct further studies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euromoneyconferences.com/Speaker-Details/8385/The-Euromoney-Egypt-Conference.html?id=6560 "Egypt: Forward Forum Concludes on High-Note With New Commercial Partnerships"]&lt;/ref&gt;

El-Baz has developed and financed two major industrial greenfield projects in Egypt, Egypt Basic Industries Corporation (EBIC) and Egypt Hydrocarbon Corporation (EHC).  EBIC represents and still is the only project to receive a comprehensive loan guarantee from the Export – Import Bank of the United States. Furthermore, EBIC is one of a select number of projects in Egypt to be financed entirely by consortium of international banks. The project had an approximate value of US$650 million at closing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2011/06/30/egypt-us-companies-partner-on-35-bln-petrochemical-project/ "Egypt, US companies partner on $3.5 bln petrochemical project"] ''Daily News Egypt''. Retrieved 2014-7-21.&lt;/ref&gt; EBIC proved to be successful and today is the 6th largest global exporter of ammonia. EBIC was eventually sold to Orascom Construction Industries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/Orascom-Construction-Industries-Invests-in-Ammonia-Plant-667856.htm "Orascom Construction Industries Invests in Ammonia Plant"] ''Market Wired''. Retrieved 2014-7-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Carbon Holdings’ second project, Egypt Hydrocarbon Corporation (EHC), with a transaction value of approximately US$550 million is considered as the first major industrial project to close in post-revolution Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2011/07/31/egypt-hydrocarbon-company-signs-454-million-deal/ "Egypt Hydrocarbon Company signs $454 million deal"] ''Daily News Egypt''.

Retrieved 2014-7-21.&lt;/ref&gt; Construction of the second project commenced in August 2011 with commercial operation scheduled to commence during the first quarter of 2017.

In December 2012, Carbon Holdings concluded its US$114 million acquisition of the Egyptian polypropylene producer, Oriental Petrochemicals Corporation (OPC), which had been shut down since 2011. After a technical and commercial restructuring, OPC re-commenced commercial operations in the fourth quarter of 2015.

Carbon Holdings is developing the approximate of US$11 billion Naphtha Cracker and Polyethylene Complex project named Tahrir Petrochemicals Corporation (TPC).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arabnews.com/news/479566 "GE, Carbon Holdings sign $500m technology cooperation deal"] ''Arab News''. Retrieved 2014-7-21.&lt;/ref&gt; It is anticipated that the project will be financed entirely by the [http://www.exim.gov/about Export – Import Bank of the United States (US EXIM)], the [https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/uk-export-finance UK Export Finance (UKEF)], [https://www.opic.gov/ Overseas Private Investment Corporation of the United States (OPIC)], [http://www.eulerhermes.com/Pages/default.aspx Euler Hermes of Germany] and [https://www.edc.ca/en/Pages/default.aspx Export Development Canada (EDC).]

Bush joined ''[[Access Hollywood]]'', a daily entertainment news magazine, as East Coast correspondent in December 2001.&lt;ref name="philly" /&gt; He was promoted to co-anchor in June 2004.

While working at ''Access Hollywood'', he was present at high-profile red carpet events including the [[Golden Globes]], [[Grammy Award|Grammys]], and [[Academy Awards]], and hosted ABC's live pre-show for the [[76th Academy Awards|2004]], [[77th Academy Awards|2005]] and [[77th Academy Awards|2006]] Academy Awards and the ''2006 Emmy Red Carpet Special''.

Bush was a reporter for NBC at the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] in [[Athens]], and was the host for ''Access Hollywood's'' coverage of the [[2006 Winter Olympics]] in [[Turin|Torino]] as well as the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in [[Beijing]]. In addition, Bush hosted the [[reality television|reality competition]] ''[[Grease: You're the One that I Want!]]'' on NBC in 2007, and stood in for [[Meredith Vieira]] for a week of ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire (U.S. game show)|Who Wants to Be a Millionaire]]'' shows on April 21–25, 2008.

He returned to radio with ''The Billy Bush Show'', a nightly [[talk radio]] and entertainment interview show.

====Trump tape scandal====
{{Main|Donald Trump Access Hollywood tape}}
On October 7, 2016, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' reported that video footage was released of [[Donald Trump]] having a lewd conversation with Bush, with Trump either unaware or unconcerned that [[Microphone gaffe|his microphone was active]]. Bush is heard laughing about Trump's failed effort to seduce a married woman, and joining in by commenting on actress [[Arianne Zucker]]'s appearance, calling her "hot as shit."&lt;ref name="WaPoOctober716"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Fahrenthold |first1=David A. |title=Trump recorded having extremely lewd conversation about women in 2005 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-recorded-having-extremely-lewd-conversation-about-women-in-2005/2016/10/07/3b9ce776-8cb4-11e6-bf8a-3d26847eeed4_story.html |access-date=October 8, 2016 |work=Washington Post |date=October 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video was made on the [[The Burbank Studios|NBC Studios]] lot in the course of videotaping an ''Access Hollywood'' episode in mid-September 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Donald Trump, Billy Bush discussed Nancy O'Dell in leaked audio |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2016/10/08/donald-trump-billy-bush-were-talking-nancy-odell-leaked-audio/91786526/ |accessdate=October 8, 2016 |work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; promoting Trump's cameo appearance in an episode of daytime soap opera ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'' to promote ''[[The Apprentice (U.S. TV series)|The Apprentice]]''.

In the video, Trump discussed a failed attempt to seduce Bush's then-co-host [[Nancy O'Dell]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Capelouto |first1=Susanna |title=Nancy O'Dell, the woman who rebuffed Trump |url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/08/us/nancy-odell-bio/ |website=CNN |publisher=Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. |accessdate=October 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; "I moved on her, and I failed. I’ll admit it. I did try and fuck her. She was married." He also talked about stars groping women: "...you just kiss...when you're a star they let you do it. You can do anything [Bush: Anything you want]...grab them by the pussy..."&lt;ref name="WaPoOctober716"/&gt;

When the news of the footage first broke, Bush was at New York's [[JFK International Airport]] waiting to take off for Los Angeles. He spent the six-hour flight reading news reports on the unfolding controversy. By the time he arrived in Los Angeles, a horde of [[paparazzi]] had materialized at [[Los Angeles International Airport]] and at his home in Los Angeles, where they remained for more than a week. Bush spent the remainder of that weekend trying to save his job at ''Today'', which had already garnered controversy, first over Bush's lack of hard-news experience and the rude tone he exhibited during red carpet events and then over the Ryan Lochte matter. Initially, NBC News signaled Bush would return that Monday to apologize on-air. Bush later stated, "I would have welcomed addressing the audience."&lt;ref name="HR2017"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/billy-bush-breaks-his-silence-trump-access-hollywood-tape-nbc-a-comeback-plan-1005744|title=Billy Bush Breaks His Silence on Trump, the ‘Access Hollywood’ Tape, NBC, and a Comeback Plan|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] | date= May 21, 2017|first1=Lacey |last1=Rose|first2= Marisa |last2=Guthrie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Bush received criticism online and calls for his resignation from the show, with ''[[The Washington Post]]'' stating, "Bush's public image was damaged—perhaps beyond repair."&lt;ref name="Yahr"/&gt; He issued an apology, stating: "Obviously I'm embarrassed and ashamed. It's no excuse, but this happened eleven years ago. I was younger, less mature, and acted foolishly in playing along. I'm very sorry."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Michael M.

After ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported in late November 2017 that Trump had privately told people, including a sitting senator, that the voice on the tape was not his, Bush published an op-ed in the paper on December 3, reaffirming that the voice in the tape was the president's and accusing him of engaging in [[Historical negationism|revisionist history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/billy-bush-reaffirms-trump-s-access-hollywood-comments-are-real-n826146|title=Billy Bush on Trump's 'Access Hollywood' tape: 'Of course he said it'|last=Johnson|first=Alex|date=December 3, 2017|work=[[NBC News]]|access-date=December 3, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/03/opinion/billy-bush-trump-access-hollywood-tape.html|title=Opinion {{!}} Billy Bush: Yes, Donald Trump, You Said That|last=Bush|first=Billy|date=December 3, 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=December 3, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Capitalism|expanded=Related}}

'''Black capitalism''' is a [[political movement]] among [[African American]]s, seeking to build wealth through the ownership and development of businesses.  Black capitalism has traditionally focused on [[African-American businesses]], although some critics and activists have also pushed for increased representation of Blacks in corporate America.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

==Historical roots==
Roots of black [[capitalism]] can be found in the lives of "Free Negroes" during times of the American Enslavement. Many records exist reporting the development of economic wealth by these "Free Negroes".

The earliest recorded words touting the economic upliftment of African Americans by an [[African American]] was written by [[Lewis Woodson]] under the pen name "Augustine" in the ''Coloured American'' newspaper. Woodson helped found Wilberforce University and the first [[African Methodist Episcopal Church|AME Theological seminary]], Payne Theological Seminary and was an early teacher and mentor of [[Martin Delany]].

A prominent southern affluent black was [[A. G. Gaston]] who was, at times, instrumental in the civil rights movement. Galston was influenced by [[Booker T. Washington]], who was an early leader at the [[Tuskegee Institute]]. Another wealthy African American was [[Robert Reed Church]], who founded the nation's first black-owned bank, Solvent Savings, in 1906.

There are many historical and current examples of neighborhoods of prominent and affluent blacks in American history. Some include the historical [[Highland Beach, Maryland|Highland Beach]], [[Maryland]] and more recently [[Mount Airy, Philadelphia|Mount Airy]] in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]],  [[Prince George's County, Maryland|Prince George's County]], Maryland and [[DeKalb County, Georgia|DeKalb County]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Mainstream media identifies this with some interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/census/2001-07-09-minorities.htm|title=Article in USA Today from 07/08/2001|accessdate=2007-07-01 | date=2001-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more focused movement of black capitalism can be found in the popular magazine ''[[Black Enterprise]]''.

==Strands of black capitalism==
There are two strands of black capitalism: the one focuses on success as a group, while the other focuses on success as an individual.

===Group success===
One strain of black capitalism is immersed in the ethic of African Americans building wealth together, as exemplified in the [[Kwanzaa]] value of "ujamaa" meaning 'cooperative economics'. A prominent proponent and example of this cooperative economics is [[Russell Simmons]] who can be seen advocating the building of not only individual black businesses but communities of black businesses. Simmons has made the comment that black MBA students and graduates have the notion that they want to own their own businesses, not to simply be [[employment|employed]] in someone else's business.

A recent effort to standardize black capitalism as a movement was introduced in two books: ''Black Labor: White Wealth'' and the more recent book ''Powernomics'' by [[Dr Claud Anderson]]. In these two books Dr. Anderson outlines a schema on which black wealth can be coordinated and developed through a nine-issue plan.

Some see this group success strain of black capitalism as a form of [[Social entrepreneurship]] which aims to build businesses that are oriented around providing services and goods that benefit the community in which they were built. Others see this as an outgrowth of the communal and tribal ethic attributed to traditional African cultures.

Black Capitalism over the last thirty years has been driven to the forefront by entertainment. Yet the question as posed in an article on Huffington Post by Antonio Moore [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/antonio-moore/the-decadent-veil-black-income-inequality_b_5646472.html "The Decadent Veil: Black America's Wealth Illusion"] questions are rising is this type of limited approach a help. "As black celebrity has been shown to millions of people, millions of times, the story of real lives has also been lost, and with it the engine that thrust forward the demand for social justice by the masses. The heartbeat of social action is to recognize your mistreatment, and demand better. With each presentation of Kobe Bryant's 25 million dollar a year contract, or Oprah's status as the sole African American billionaire a veil of false calm is created within the overall American economic psyche about the immense black wealth disparity."

===Individual success===
A parallel, but possibly opposing, strain of black capitalism stems from the American ideal of building individual wealth. Prominent examples of this can be popular figures such as [[Oprah Winfrey]] and [[Robert L. Johnson]]. The complaint leveled{{By whom|date=April 2016}} against the adherents of individual success from advocates of group success is that individually wealthy African Americans have made millions of dollars and that that in and of itself has made very little contribution to the plight of African Americans in general.

In general, African Americans and the media{{Who|date=April 2016}} sometimes point to this phenomenon as "black flight" or "selling out" where affluent blacks move out of predominantly black neighborhoods into affluent white neighborhoods. A history of some of this is documented in the book ''Our Kind of People: Inside America's Black Upper Class'' by Otis Graham.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawrenceotisgraham.com/content/our_kind_of_people.asp ''Our Kind of People: Inside America's Black Upper Class'' by Otis Graham]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues facing black capitalism==
{{Black Power sidebar}}
===As distinct from racial integration===
The notion of [[racial integration]] is such that African Americans should be able to move and operate in a predominately white society safely. This effort at racial integration concerns mostly public spaces and private hiring practices. It is thought that attempts and movements supporting racial integration are efforts to enable blacks to assimilate into white institutions.

Black capitalism is an effort to position blacks as the owners of land, the means of production, and businesses that own either or both. The aim of black capitalism is to bolster self-reliance, both individually and communally.

===Black anti-capitalism===
There are also two strands of thinking in African America, and specifically Black Nationalism, that is against capitalism as an [[economic system]] in all of its forms. One strand is against capitalism on the basis of the historical treatment of Africans and the African Diaspora, i.e. [[slavery]], subjugation, and [[colonization]]. Another strand is against capitalism through strict political critiques, i.e. [[socialism|socialist]]. Many critics of capitalism from within the black community blend the two positions, however the reasoning behind them are distinct. A prominent black political critic was [[C. L. R. James]]. Two of the most popular black anti-capitalist books are ''[[How Europe Underdeveloped Africa]]'' by [[Walter Rodney]] and ''[[How Capitalism Underdeveloped Black America]]'' by [[Manning Marable]]. These books give analysis on how capitalism as an economic system has not raised the [[quality of living]] for the African Diaspora.

===Violence against black capitalism===
Examples of the explicit and public opposition to African American economic success have diminished since the Civil Rights movement. However, before this period of American transition, there are a few notable violent attacks against prosperous African American communities including the [[Tulsa Race Riot]] and the [[Rosewood massacre]].

===Economic disparity===
Blacks on average have a lower net worth than whites in America. This is especially pertinent in the creation of new businesses. One of the most common forms of collateral for loans to open businesses is home equity. With the historical and current differences in lending patterns toward blacks and whites, the option of using home equity to borrow against in order to open a business is diminished.

The article "America's Financial Divide"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/antonio-moore/the-decadent-veil-black-income-inequality_b_5646472.html "America's Financial Divide"]&lt;/ref&gt; added context to racial wealth inequality, stating
&lt;blockquote&gt;...nearly 96.1 percent of the 1.2 million households in the top one percent by income were white, a total of about 1,150,000 households. In addition, these families were found to have a median net asset worth of {{sic|$8.3 million dollars}}. In stark contrast, in the same piece black households were shown as a mere 1.4 percent of the top one percent by income, that's only 16,800 homes. In addition, their median net asset worth was just {{sic|$1.2 million dollars}}. Using this data as an indicator only about 8,400 of the over 14 million African American households have more than {{sic|$1.2 million dollars}} in net assets...Relying on data from Credit Suisse and Brandeis University's Institute on Assets and Social Policy, the Harvard Business Review in the article "How America's Wealthiest Black Families Invest Money" recently took the analysis above a step further. In the piece the author stated "If you're white and have a net worth of about $356,000, that's good enough to put you in the 72nd percentile of white families. If you're black, it's good enough to catapult you into the 95th percentile." This means 28 percent of the total 83 million white homes, or over 23 million white households, have more than $356,000 in net assets. While only 700,000 of the 14 million black homes have more than $356,000 in total net worth.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A '''business guru''' or '''management guru''' is a leading authority on business practices and can be defined as 'a person with [[influencer|influential]] ideas or theories about business'. The earliest use of the term business guru can be tracked back to the 1960s being used in ''[[Business Week]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = business guru - definition of business guru in English from the Oxford dictionary|url = http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/business-guru?q=business+guru|website = www.oxforddictionaries.com|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are no existing qualifications that make someone a business guru.

One English&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.randomhouse.co.uk/authors/carol-kennedy |title=Carol Kennedy |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=Random House Group |access-date=2015-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; writer has described management gurus as "overwhelmingly a US phenomenon."&lt;ref name="Kennedy 2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kennedy|first=Carol|title=Guide to the Management Gurus: 5th Edition|year=2012|publisher=Random House|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I-HqZ8wyeYMC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples and lists==

There is no definitive list of business gurus, but some writers have proposed "personal" lists.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; These lists are mostly created by organizations such as business magazines or management writers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There have been many business guru lists created through history.

A list consisting of people who are included in almost all of the lists created, collectively known as the "Famous Five", are: [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]], [[Michael Porter]], [[Alfred Sloan]], [[Peter Drucker]], and [[Douglas McGregor]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hindle|first=Tim|title=Guide to Management Ideas and Gurus|year=2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|pages=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-K_wp74bK3sC&amp;pg=PA1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, ''Harvard Business Review'' asked the gurus to name their favorite gurus. The people named were Peter Drucker, James March and Herbert Simon.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Another list includes Peter Drucker, Michael Porter, and [[Tom Peters]] as the three leading gurus of our time.&lt;ref name="Kennedy 2012"/&gt;

There are also many gurus who have emerged and disappeared through history. For example, the Japanese were known for making improvements to the business world and bringing out gurus in the 1980s, which included Keniche Ohmae and Akio Morita. Then European gurus emerged, which included Yves Doz, Geert Hofstede, Manfred Kets De Vries and Charles Handy.&lt;ref name="Hindle"/&gt;

==Criticisms of "guru" status==
One management expert, [[Gary Hamel]], says there have been "few genuine breakthroughs" since the work of Taylor and [[Max Weber]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Asian Development Bank|title=Compendium of Knowledge Solutions|year=2010|publisher=Asian Development Bank|pages=304|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vAo_CQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT304#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book, Hamel says that management is "stuck in a time warp."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hamel|first=Gary|title=The Future of Management|year=2013|publisher=Harvard Business Press|pages=4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gLktvtlqHSYC&amp;pg=PA4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, even one of the authors of a book about management gurus warns that [[management theory]] is "not served well by fads," citing [[Enron]] as a "[[management fad]] for its supposed culture of [[innovation]]."&lt;ref name="Kennedy 2012"/&gt;

Founded in 1908, the '''Certified General Accountants Association of Canada''' ('''CGA-Canada''') serves [[Certified General Accountant]]s and students in Canada and nearly 100 countries. CGA-Canada established the designation's certification requirements and professional standards, offers professional development, conducts research and advocacy, and represents CGAs nationally and internationally. CGA-Canada is working with the [[Chartered Professional Accountant]]s of Canada (CPA Canada) to integrate operations under the CPA banner in 2014. CPA Canada is the new national accounting body formed by the merger of the [[Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants]] (CICA) and the Society of [[Certified Management Accountant]]s (CMA) in 2013.

In October 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 CGA-Canada was named one of "Canada's Top 100 Employers" by Mediacorp Canada Inc., CGA-Canada has also been named one of "BC's Top Employers" and one of "Canada's Greenest Employers".

==History==

The national association, first known as the Canadian Accountants' Association, was founded in 1908 by a trio of Canadian Pacific Railway accountants in Montreal, Quebec. Five years later, in 1913, the General Accountants' Association, as it was then known, was granted a charter from the government of Canada. By the mid-1940s, association chapters were established from coast-to-coast. Provincial, territorial and regional (offshore) chapters were later established under their own charters.

Auditing rights are regulated by provincial governments.   In [[Prince Edward Island]], only qualified CAs and CGAs can perform public accounting and auditing in accordance with the Public Accounting and Auditing Act.  In all other provinces, except Quebec and Ontario (detailed below), only qualified CAs, CGAs, and CMAs (Certified Management Accountants) may audit public companies.

*'''1948''' Bilingual origins: Examinations are offered in English and French in Quebec. The move to a bilingual organization is underway.
*'''1950s''' CGA-British Columbia and the University of British Columbia's School of Commerce develop an innovative five-year extension program, available on campus or by correspondence. The program is later adopted in other jurisdictions and becomes a national curriculum standard.
*'''1964''' Education program goes international: The education program is extended to the  Caribbean and Bermuda.
*'''1974''' Code of Ethics enshrined: CGA-Canada approves what would become the Code of Ethical Principles and Rules of Conduct.
*'''1977''' Founding member of IFAC: CGA-Canada becomes a founding member of the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC).
*'''1982''' Name change to  the '''Certified General Accountants Association of Canada'''.
*'''1988''' John Leslie's award: The John Leslie Award is established in honour of the association's founding president and Chair, and recognizes exceptional service.
*'''1987-1991''' Competency-based accounting education: A major revision of the CGA education program is completed. Competency-based objectives, management emphasis and integration of ethics and information technology become hallmarks of the revised program.
*'''1998''' Degree required: CGAs are now required to obtain a bachelor's degree prior to certification. Partnerships are developed with universities to provide distance-learning options.
*'''2003''' Asian links secured: CGA-Hong Kong is granted affiliate status. CGA education materials are offered at more than a dozen Chinese universities.
*'''2013''' Unifying the accounting profession: CGA-Canada entered into an Integration Agreement with CPA Canada, the body responsible for the new national designation [[Chartered Professional Accountant]].
*'''2014''' Unification completes in October 2014.

Historically [[Quebec]] and [[Ontario]] only allowed CAs to audit public companies. In 2004, the Ontario government passed legislation that would enable CAs, CGAs and CMAs to practice public accounting under a reconstituted Public Accountants Council, and as of June 2010 Ontario CGAs were allowed to issue audit opinions.

In August 2005, a panel was constituted under the Agreement on Internal Trade (AIT) to rule on a challenge filed by CGA New Brunswick and CGA-Canada. It found Quebec's measures denying CGAs the right to practice public accounting in Quebec to impair trade and recommended legislative changes. The Quebec government committed to address the problem. By November 2009, the 'Regulation respecting the public accountancy permit of the Ordre des comptables généraux accrédités du Québec' enabled qualified CGAs to offer the full range of public accounting services to for-profit and publicly listed companies.

On November 6, 2009, Ontario issued a Notice of Measure claiming that material differences exist in respect of the practice of public accounting in Canada and to protect consumers out of province public accountants would be assessed against Ontario's requirements. Manitoba supported by Alberta, British Columbia and Saskatchewan objected on the grounds that the Ontario regime causes injury to CGAs and impairs internal trade. A Panel convened under the Agreement on Internal Trade reviewed submissions and held a public hearing in Toronto on November 29, 2011. The Panel found that Ontario's notice of measure has impaired or would impair internal trade and has caused or would cause injury. The Panel recommended that Ontario comply with its AIT obligations by April 15, 2012. The outcome is important for CGAs because it removes the last barrier to mobility, allowing CGAs to practice anywhere in Canada.

In November 2008, Dr. Catherine Boivie was appointed to the Board of Directors as the Public Representative. Based in British Columbia, Dr. Boivie is the chief executive officer of Inventure Solutions and senior vice-president of information technology (IT) and facilities at Vancity, Canada's largest credit union.

In October 2013, CGA-Canada entered into an Integration Agreement with CPA Canada, the body responsible for the new national designation [[Chartered Professional Accountant]].  This followed most provincial CGA bodies ratifying the unification of the accounting profession in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cpacanada.ca/blog/2013/10/09/cpa-canada-welcomes-positive-cga-member-vote-result/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131129220319/http://cpacanada.ca/blog/2013/10/09/cpa-canada-welcomes-positive-cga-member-vote-result/ |archivedate=2013-11-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==

CGA-Canada's professional education program is competency-based. Competency-based education requires candidates to perform tasks and roles to standards expected in the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cga.org/canada/competency{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The knowledge, skills and professional values required of a CGA are reflected in a list of competencies. These competencies extend over three areas: professionalism, leadership and professional knowledge. They are validated periodically through extensive survey analysis. The CGA Competency Framework details the 130 competencies required of a newly certified CGA.

The complete academic program consists of 19 courses, two business cases, and professional qualification exams, spread over several levels: Levels 1 to 3 (Foundation Studies), Level 4 (Advanced Studies), and final level, the PACE qualification or certification level.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cga.org/canada{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A CGA must have an undergraduate degree. Students normally require 36 months of supervised work experiences, but in all cases they require a minimum of 24 months. They may meet the experience requirements in any business sector and in a variety of fields.

Before issuing audit opinions a CGA must first be licensed as a public accountant. The requirements for licensing include at least 500 public accounting hours per year.

CGA is recognized in 170+ countries through their partnership with ACCA.

CGA-Canada has been providing online professional accounting education. Via the Internet, students can complete their studies using a system that integrates text material, study guides, video and audio tools, discussion forums, group case study and project work, web research and email.

Introduced in 2011, Professional Experience Required for Certification (PERC) is the national reporting process for students in the CGA program. With PERC, students can document their experiences online and submit it annually.

In addition to its own online program of studies, CGA-Canada has also developed online degree partnerships with several Canadian universities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cga-canada.org/en-ca/Programs/Education/Pages/ca_edu_online_learning.aspx CGA-Canada's website Online learning] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090502001327/http://www.cga-canada.org/en-ca/Programs/Education/Pages/ca_edu_online_learning.aspx |date=May 2, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mutual recognition agreements==

In December 2006, CGA-Canada and the [[Association of Chartered Certified Accountants]] (ACCA) announced a mutual recognition agreement (MRA) to take effect on 1 January 2007. This agreement was renewed in 2011.

In April 2008, CGA-Canada and [[CPA Australia]] entered into a MRA to extend the global reach of both organizations into new continents. [http://www.cga-canada.org/en-ca/OtherDocuments/ca_mra_ad.pdf]

In June 2009, CGA-Canada and CPA Ireland [http://www.cpaireland.ie/] entered into a mutual recognition agreement. The MRA establishes a strategic partnership between the two leading accounting organizations and gives members the opportunity to qualify for another designation. [http://www.cga-canada.org/en-ca/MediaCentre/CurrentMediaReleases/Pages/ca_mdr_2009-06-03.aspx]

In June 2010, CGA-Canada and the [[Ordre des Experts-Comptables]], France's foremost accounting organization, have entered into a MRA. Under this accord, CGAs and members of the CSOEC can be considered for membership by the other body. [http://www.cga-canada.org/en-ca/MediaCentre/MediaReleases/CurrentMediaReleases/Pages/ca_mdr_2010-06-28.aspx]

'''Chambers Street–World Trade Center''' on the [[IND Eighth Avenue Line]] is an express station with four tracks and two [[island platform]]s, but in an unusual layout: the station has separate island platforms for express and local trains.&lt;ref name="tracks3"&gt;{{NYCS const|trackref|trackbook3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both island platforms can accommodate {{convert|600|ft|m|adj=on}} trains. There is a passenger connection between the two platforms at [[mezzanine (architecture)|mezzanine]] level. This passageway also includes the in-system transfer to the IRT station. Both platforms opened just after midnight on September 10, 1932, as did the rest of the IND Eighth Avenue Line north to [[Inwood–207th Street (IND Eighth Avenue Line)|Inwood–207th Street]].&lt;ref name=Chambers/&gt;&lt;ref name="Opening"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Crowell|first1=Paul|title=Gay Midnight Crowd Rides First Trains In The New Subway: Throngs at Station an Hour Before Time, Rush Turnstiles When Chains are Dropped|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1932/09/10/100849529.pdf|accessdate=November 8, 2015|publisher=New York Times|date=September 10, 1932}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A late-1990s renovation saw prefabricated tile panels installed on the trackside wall of the express platform, with a tile band of Concord Violet bordered in black and "CHAMBERS" in white Copperplate lettering on black tiles on each panel, and on the local platform's walls the new tiles were installed in 3-foot by 2-foot sections with a slightly different shade of dark blue violet bordered in black; no station name captions were placed. The trim lines in the entryways and passages use the Concord Violet color rather than the blue violet.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

'''Chambers Street''', the express platform, is a through station. Just north of Chambers Street station is a third track between the uptown and downtown express tracks, with connecting switches at both ends, which was used to turn trains when Chambers Street was used as a terminal,&lt;ref name="tracks" /&gt; before the Broadway–Nassau Street (now [[Fulton Street (IND Eighth Avenue Line)|Fulton Street]]) station opened on February 1, 1933.&lt;ref name="Jay"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1933/02/01/archives/city-opens-subway-to-brooklyn-today-regular-express-service-on-the.html|title=City Opens Subway to Brooklyn Today|date=February 1, 1933|work=[[New York Times]]|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is served by the '''{{NYCS|A}}''' and '''{{NYCS|C}}''' trains. This platform is not [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|wheelchair-accessible]], although it can possibly gain accessibility in the future because the elevator to the local platform leads to the mezzanine that is shared with this station. However, it is one block away from the [[Chambers Street (IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line)|Chambers Street]] station on the [[IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line]], which is wheelchair-accessible.

'''World Trade Center''', the local platform, forms the terminus of the local service and is offset to the south of the express platform, at the northern edge of the [[World Trade Center site]].&lt;ref name="tracks" /&gt; It is served by the '''{{NYCS|E}}''' train. Southbound local trains reach the platform by ramping underneath the express tracks south of [[Canal Street (IND Eighth Avenue Line)|Canal Street]] station. The northern end of the World Trade Center station has a signal tower and a [[diamond crossover]] switch that are roughly at the middle of the through-platform.

The local tracks end at [[bumper block]]s at the south end of the platform. In addition, there is a platform-level passageway on the western side of the station toward the platform's south end, evidence of a former half-length [[side platform]] for the western track; while in passenger use as a connection to the rest of the station, the former platform is now fenced off from the rest of the local platform level, and passengers must now use the mezzanine to access the island platform.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nycsubway.org/perl/show?133204 Photo of side platform in use, dated September 1, 1990]&lt;/ref&gt; A connection to the [[World Trade Center station (PATH)|World Trade Center PATH station]] is also available at the station's south end;&lt;ref name=nyt-20161218/&gt; this, in turn, gives access to the [[Fulton Center]] (via the [[Dey Street Passageway]]), the Cortlandt Street station of the [[BMT Broadway Line]], and the [[WTC Cortlandt (IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line)|WTC Cortlandt Street]] station on the [[IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Out of Dust and Debris, a New Jewel Rises|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/10/nyregion/fulton-center-a-subway-complex-reopens-in-lower-manhattan.html|newspaper=New York Times|last=Yee|first=Vivian|date=November 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another passageway also leads directly to the southbound BMT Broadway Line platform.

The station was formerly named '''Hudson Terminal''' or '''H&amp;M''', after the nearby [[Hudson Terminal]] of the [[Hudson and Manhattan Railroad]] (now the PATH). Since 1973, this station has been named after the two World Trade Centers. Wall tiles reading "H &lt;small&gt;AND&lt;/small&gt; M" remained on the walls of the World Trade Center station as late as December 1974,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nycsubway.org/perl/show?5644 NYCSubway.org: Photograph of H&amp;M/World Trade Center station dated December 12, 1974]&lt;/ref&gt; a year after the first World Trade Center was completed. The tiles were initially painted over, but since the station's renovation, they have been covered over.

===Exits===
Exits/entrances through turnstiles to [[Church Street (Manhattan)|Church Street]] are located in the mezzanine of this station, along with a few [[HEET turnstile|High Entrance-Exit Turnstiles]] (HEETs). There are street stairs:
* at all four corners of Church and Chambers Streets&lt;ref name=MTA-NameofNeighborhood-2015/&gt;
* at both western corners of Church and Warren Streets&lt;ref name=MTA-NameofNeighborhood-2015/&gt;
* at both western corners of Church and Murray Streets&lt;ref name=MTA-NameofNeighborhood-2015/&gt;
* at all four corners of Church Street and Park Place; there is also an elevator to the local platform at the southeastern corner&lt;ref name=MTA-NameofNeighborhood-2015/&gt;
* at the southwestern corner of Church and Barclay Streets&lt;ref name=MTA-NameofNeighborhood-2015/&gt;
* at the northwestern and southeastern corners of Church and Vesey Streets&lt;ref name=MTA-NameofNeighborhood-2015/&gt;
* at the northeastern corner of Church and Fulton Streets&lt;ref name=MTA-NameofNeighborhood-2015/&gt;

There is also a passageway to the [[World Trade Center (PATH)|PATH station]] at the very southern end of the local platform (see {{section link||Accessibility}}).&lt;ref name=nyt-20161218/&gt;&lt;ref name=opening20161218/&gt;

The only transfer between the local platform and the express platform is available only at the very tips of both platforms, where the two platforms are opposite each other for a few feet. Passengers must walk down the express platform to the southernmost staircase, go up to a different part of the mezzanine, crossover, and then go down a staircase to the northern end of the local platform. This complex transfer is to allow a continued underground mezzanine outside of fare control from the southern end at the World Trade Center, which is just one block west of the [[Fulton Street (IND Eighth Avenue Line)|Fulton Street]] station on the IND Eighth Avenue Line, to the most northern street stairs at Chambers and Church Street, which is just one block east of the [[Chambers Street (IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line)|Chambers Street]] station of the [[IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line]].&lt;ref name=MTA-NameofNeighborhood-2015/&gt; The total length of the mezzanine is seven blocks.

===Presentation on maps===
[[File:Chambers-WTC new entrance Oct 6, 2016 01.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A new entrance at Church Street and Park Place]]
The station has been portrayed in a variety of ways on [[New York City Subway map]]s since 1932. Originally, it was shown as a single station called '''Chambers Street–[[Hudson Terminal]]'''. Starting in about 1948, two stations were shown, Chambers Street–Hudson Terminal for the express trains continuing to [[Brooklyn]], and Hudson Terminal for the local trains terminating at the station. A 1959 map showed two stations enclosed in a box, but a single label. The 1964 and 1966 maps were similar.

On the 1972 map, it once again appeared to be a single station, with the label showing Chambers Street, Hudson Terminal, World Trade Center, and PATH, although the Hudson Terminal office building complex had already been demolished by this time.

On the current map&lt;ref&gt;{{NYCS const|map}}&lt;/ref&gt; published by the [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]], it is shown as two separate stations with a free transfer—'''Chambers Street''' (served by '''A''' and '''C''' trains) and '''World Trade Center''' (served by '''E''' trains). Signs in the Fulton Center only show the E when pointing toward the World Trade Center station, as the A, C, 2 and 3 trains serve both station complexes.

===January 23, 2005 fire===

Around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. on January 23, 2005, a fire destroyed the [[interlocking]] plant at Chambers Street. As a result, two-thirds of '''A''' trains were canceled or rerouted, including all rush-hour trips to [[Rockaway Park–Beach 116th Street (IND Rockaway Line)|Rockaway Park–Beach 116th Street]]. '''C''' service was completely suspended and replaced by the '''A''' and '''[[V (New York City Subway service)|V]]''' in Brooklyn and '''A''', '''[[B (New York City Subway service)|B]]''', '''[[D (New York City Subway service)|D]]''', and '''[[E (New York City Subway service)|E]]''' in Manhattan. Some newspaper articles blamed the fire on a homeless person trying to keep warm, but that was never confirmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/24/nyregion/24transit.html|title=Signal Room Fire Reroutes Trains on 3 Subway Lines|date=January 24, 2005|work=The New York Times|accessdate=July 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until January 28, the MTA rerouted the '''A''' to the connected [[IND Sixth Avenue Line]], [[Rutgers Street Tunnel]], and [[IND Culver Line]] (the route used by regular '''[[F (New York City Subway service)|F]]''' service) from [[West Fourth Street–Washington Square (IND Eighth Avenue Line)|West Fourth Street]] to [[Jay Street–MetroTech (IND Lines)|Jay Street]] between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m., in order to perform critical repairs.

Initial estimates gave a time of three to five years to restore full service because the destroyed equipment was custom-made for the MTA.&lt;ref name="Chan 2006"/&gt; That was later cut back to six to nine months to bring back normal operations. However, '''C''' service and 70% of '''A''' service was restored at 5 a.m. on February 2, 2005, only ten days after the fire. The rush-hour '''A''' trips were restored on February 14. On April 21, full service was restored. However, effects of the fire continued into 2006 because the equipment had not been replaced.&lt;ref name="Chan 2006"&gt;{{cite web | last=Chan | first=Sewell | title=Year After Subway Fire, Damaged Equipment Is Still Not Replaced | website=The New York Times | date=January 25, 2006 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/25/nyregion/25subway.html | accessdate=October 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Park Place''' station on the [[IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line]] was built on the portion of the line built as part of the [[Dual Contracts]], which is the section south of [[Times Square–42nd Street (IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line)|Times Square–42nd Street]].

During the 1964–1965 fiscal year, the platforms at Park Place, along with those at four other stations on the Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line, were lengthened to 525 feet to accommodate a ten-car train of 51-foot IRT cars.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Annual Report 1964–1965|last=|first=|publisher=New York City Transit Authority|year=1965|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has two tracks and a single island platform with a line of blue i-beam columns with alternating ones having the standard black name plate in white lettering. Both track walls have a mostly gold trim line along with the "P" tablets at regular intervals.

Northwest (railroad north) of the station, the tracks of this station become the express tracks of the [[IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line]], curving sharply northeast under [[West Broadway]].&lt;ref name="tracks"/&gt; The station is very close to the next stop north, [[Chambers Street (IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line)|Chambers Street]] at West Broadway, and the northernmost entrances of this station at Church and Chambers Streets are less than {{convert|400|ft|m}} from the entrances to the station at Chambers Street and West Broadway.&lt;ref name=MTA-NameofNeighborhood-2015/&gt;

===Exits===
The station has a mezzanine at each end. Towards the western end of the platform, two long staircases lead up to an intermediate landing where another, shorter staircase leads up to the main IND mezzanine near the full ''Oculus'' mosaic. From here, there is a bank of turnstiles leading to the street stair that goes to the northwest corner of Park Place and Church Street. A staircase in this mezzanine leads down to the very southern end of the IND express platform, where transfer to the local platform is via another set of stairs.&lt;ref name=MTA-NameofNeighborhood-2015/&gt;

The IRT platform has its own entrance/exit at its extreme eastern (railroad south) end. Here, a staircase and two escalators, none of which are together, lead up to a mezzanine just beneath the street. The staircase splits into two separate staircases at an initial landing and each of those have another intermediate landing. On this mezzanine, there are turnstiles, both regular and [[Turnstile|HEET]] (from when the mezzanine had a part-time token booth and the regular turnstiles could not be left unstaffed). A single street stair leads out to the northwest corner of Broadway and Park Place. The signage for this entrance is the only one in the complex that says "Park Place" with bullets only for the '''2''' and '''3''' trains. This stair is very close to the BMT Broadway Line's [[City Hall (BMT Broadway Line)|City Hall]] station, an entrance to which is about {{convert|200|ft|m}} away, on the other side of Broadway.&lt;ref name=MTA-NameofNeighborhood-2015/&gt; A short staircase in that mezzanine once led to an entrance to the lobby of the [[Woolworth Building]]. It has been closed since the [[September 11 attacks]].

'''Cortlandt Street''' is a local [[metro station|station]] on the [[BMT Broadway Line]]. Originally opened in 1918, the station is located under [[Church Street (Manhattan)|Church Street]], between [[Fulton Street (Manhattan)|Fulton]] and [[Cortlandt Street (Manhattan)|Cortlandt Street]]s.

This underground station, opened on January 5, 1918,&lt;ref name=nyt1918/&gt; has two tracks and two [[side platform]]s.&lt;ref name=tracks/&gt; It is the closest station on the BMT Broadway Line to the [[World Trade Center (2001–present)|World Trade Center]].&lt;ref name=maps/&gt; Immediately north of this station, the line utilizes a sharp [[reverse curve]], first turning east under Vesey Street, then turning north under Broadway toward [[City Hall (BMT Broadway Line)|City Hall]].&lt;ref name="tracks"&gt;{{NYCS const|trackref|trackbook}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Passageways link this station to three others outside fare control: the [[World Trade Center station (PATH)|World Trade Center PATH station]], the [[World Trade Center–Cortlandt (IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line)|WTC Cortlandt]] station, and the [[Fulton Street (New York City Subway)|Fulton Street]] station, all through the [[Dey Street Passageway]] underneath the station. The station also contains a free transfer to the Chambers Street–World Trade Center and Park Place stations via the southbound platform.

===Exits===

Both eastern corner of Church and Dey Streets contain a staircase exit from the northbound platform. There is also a staircase to the northeast corner of Church and Cortlandt Streets.&lt;ref name="maps"&gt;{{cite web|title=MTA Neighborhood Maps: Lower Manhattan|url= http://web.mta.info/maps/neighborhoods/mn/M01_lower_manh_2015.pdf |website=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority|mta.info]]|publisher=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]]|accessdate=August 21, 2015|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both platforms are connected to the [[World Trade Center Transportation Hub]] via an underpass and to the [[Fulton Center]] via the [[Dey Street Passageway]]. This station is [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|ADA-accessible]] via the latter connection.&lt;ref name=maps/&gt; An underground passageway also leads to [[One Liberty Plaza]].&lt;ref name=maps/&gt; An exit at the north end of the southbound platform once led to the original [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]]'s lower concourse, and now leads to the [[Westfield World Trade Center]] shopping mall within the WTC Transportation Hub.&lt;ref name=maps/&gt; A passageway at the north end of the southbound platform also leads to the [[World Trade Center (IND Eighth Avenue Line)|World Trade Center]] subway station. The connection opened on December 29, 2017 along with a passageway connecting World Trade Center with Tower 2, and passageways connecting the southbound platform of Cortlandt Street to the Oculus and to Tower 4. Fare control areas had to be reconfigured.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tribecacitizen.com/2017/12/30/getting-to-the-oculus-just-got-much-easier/|title=Getting to the Oculus Just Got Much Easier|last=|first=|date=December 30, 2017|website=Tribeca Citizen|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=January 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CortlandtStreetSBOpening2011.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ribbon cutting]] for the reopening of the southbound platform]]
The station was overhauled in the late 1970s, with repairs made to the structural and cosmetic appearance. The original BMT wall tiles were removed and the "new" station walls contained cinderblock tiles (colored white with small recesses painted yellow), with black and white station-name signs bolted into the recesses. Lighting was converted from incandescent to fluorescent and staircases and platform edges were repaired. 

Much of the cosmetic change that came with this renovation was undone in a subsequent 1998–1999 renovation. In addition to "state-of-repair" work and upgrades for [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|ADA accessibility]], the station's original 1918 tilework was restored. Other improvements were made to the [[public address]] system, directional signage, and concrete trackbeds.

The station sustained significant damage during the collapse of the adjacent [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] towers on September 11, 2001. It was closed for repairs, which included removal of debris, fixing structural damage, and restoring the track beds, which had suffered flood damage in the aftermath of the collapse. The station reopened on September 15, 2002.

On August 20, 2005, the station was closed again for installation of the Dey Street Passageway below Dey Street as part of the [[Fulton Center]] project. At the same time, the station is to be made [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|ADA-accessible]] in both directions. Previously, the station was accessible on the southbound side only via the temporary [[Port Authority Trans-Hudson|PATH]] [[World Trade Center (PATH station)|World Trade Center]] station's elevator. MTA posters and flyers at that time indicated the station would reopen in the spring of 2006, and later by spring of 2007, but neither reopening schedules occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mta.info/nyct/service/pdf_f/03_rwnco3.pdf |title=Cortlandt St station remains closed |accessdate=April 12, 2007 |publisher=[[New York City Transit Authority]] |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926221123/http://www.mta.info/nyct/service/pdf_f/03_rwnco3.pdf |archivedate=September 26, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The northbound side of the station finally reopened on November 25, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ny1.com/7-brooklyn-news-content/news_beats/transit/109514/mta-chairman-to-re-open-r-w-cortlandt-street-station/|title=MTA Chairman Reopens R/W Cortlandt Street Station|publisher=NY1 News|accessdate=November 25, 2009|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120630094050/http://ny1.com/7-brooklyn-news-content/news_beats/transit/109514/mta-chairman-to-re-open-r-w-cortlandt-street-station/#|archive-date=June 30, 2012|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lowermanhattan.info/news/cortlandt_st_northbound_subway_21173.aspx |title=Cortlandt St Northbound Subway Platform Reopens |accessdate=November 22, 2009 |publisher=Lower Manhattan Construction Command Center/LMDC |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091130023107/http://www.lowermanhattan.info/news/cortlandt_st_northbound_subway_21173.aspx# |archive-date=November 30, 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The southbound platform reopened on September 6, 2011, while continuing excavation along the Church Street side of the World Trade Center site was being performed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/zero_station_set_to_reopen_hzX7ruzYrrKOlWQoS80Z5M|title=G.

The [[Dey Street Passageway]], outside of the [[fare control]], connects the [[Fulton Street (New York City Subway)|Fulton Street]] station complex to the Cortlandt Street station and to the [[World Trade Center Transportation Hub]]. It opened on November 10, 2014, while the World Trade Center was still under construction.&lt;ref name="EIS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mta.info/capital/fc_docs/feis/chapters/ch03.pdf|title=''Fulton Street Transit Center, Final Environmental Impact Statement and Section 4(f) Evaluation'', Ch. 3, p. 3-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the opening of the Dey Street Passageway, ridership at the station has increased dramatically. Between 2014 and 2016, ridership at the station increased from 1,500,040 to 4,270,036, a 184 percent increase.&lt;ref name="2016-rider" /&gt;

{{distinguish|text=the [[World Trade Center Transportation Hub]] headhouse that is connected to this station, which is also referred to as "Oculus"}}
There are over 300 mosaics dispersed throughout the IND and IRT stations, which are part of the 1998 installation ''Oculus'' created by [[Jones/Ginzel|Kristin Jones and Andrew Ginzel]]. These eyes were modeled on photographs of the eyes of hundreds of New Yorkers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nycsubway.org/wiki/IND_8th_Avenue_Line#Chambers_Street-World_Trade_Center|title=www.nycsubway.org: IND 8th Avenue Line|website=www.nycsubway.org|access-date=July 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Jones and Ginzel,

{{quote|''Oculus'' is a constellation of stone and glass mosaics in the underground labyrinth of interconnected subway stations of lower Manhattan. Over three hundred mosaic eyes, drawn from a photographic study of more than twelve hundred young New Yorkers, are set into the white tile walls of the World Trade Center/Park Place/Chamber Street Stations. The work's centerpiece is a large exquisitely detailed, elliptical glass and stone mosaic floor (38 ft 8 in x 20'8") at the heart of the Park Place Station. The continents of the earth, interwoven with the City of New York amidst an ultramarine pool, surround a large eye in the middle of the mosaic. The mosaic is at once a vision of the world, a reflecting pool of water and a representation New York City in its proper geographical orientation.

[[File:Oculus vc.jpg|thumb|The eyes of "Oculus"]]
The work's detailed renderings of the eye–the most telling, fragile and vulnerable human feature–offer a profound sense of intimacy within a public place. Together, the images create a sense of unity and flow: animating, orienting and humanizing the station. ''Oculus'' invites a dialogue between the site and those who move through it.

Oculus was realized in collaboration with the Roman mosaicist, Rinaldo Piras, Sectile.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Jones |first1=Kristin |last2=Ginzel |first2=Andrew |title=Oculus |url=http://www.andrewginzel.com/JONESGINZEL/PROJECTS/ALL/oculus/oculustxt.html |accessdate=June 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2659">In [[Canadian contract law]], '''Contract A''' is a concept that has recently been applied by courts regarding the fair and equal treatment of bidders in a [[contract tendering process]]. Essentially this concept formalizes previously applied precedents and strengthens the protection afforded to those who submit bids in the tendering process. The concept was introduced in 1981 by the [[Supreme Court of Canada]], in ''[[R. v. Ron Engineering and Construction (Eastern) Ltd]]''&lt;ref&gt;Government Procurement, Fourth Edition, by Paul Emanuelli, p. 125, Published by Lexis Nexis Canada, Year of Publication: 2017, {{ISBN|978-0-433-47454-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The court found that a "[[duty of fairness]]" was owed to all bidders by an owner in a tendering process.

The Contract A is formed when a "request for proposal" is responded to in the form of a valid bid, sometimes also known as submission of price. As many Contracts A are formed between the owner (person, company or organization tendering the project) and the bidders as their bids are received. The owner must now deal fairly and equally with all bidders, and must not show any favouritism or [[prejudice]] towards any bidder(s). In essence, this concept boils down to the right of an individual to have equal opportunity to be successful with their bid for work.

A breach of Contract A may occur if the owner (or an owner's officer or representative, see [[vicarious liability]]), provides information, changes specification during the tendering process to unfairly benefit a particular bidder, enters into closed negotiations with an individual bidder in an effort to obtain more desirable contract conditions, etc. The most common situation in which an owner is accused of having breached Contract A occurs when a bidder is selected who is not the lowest bidder. This contravenes established custom and practice, which would normally dictate that the lowest bid be awarded the contract, but is not normally a source of a breach if handled properly. The successful suits for breach typically occur if the lowest bidder has been excluded based on a stipulation not clearly outlined in the tender documents (such as preference for local bidders) or when the [[Privilege Clause]] employed by the owner to exclude a principle of custom and practice is judged by the courts to be too broadly worded to have any meaning.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="553">'''Derivatives law''' is the area of law governing [[Derivative (finance)|derivatives]]. It is associated with principles of [[contract law]], and practitioners must also have a good understanding of [[insolvency]], netting and set-off, and [[conflict of laws]].

Over-the-counter derivatives are documented under master agreements, the most common of which is the [[International Swaps and Derivatives Association]] (ISDA) Master Agreement.

A '''drummer''' was responsible for the drums in the army for use on the battlefield. Drums were part of the field music for hundreds of years, being introduced by the Ottomans to Europe. Chinese armies however had used drums even before that. With the professionalization of armies, military music was developed as well. Drums were not only used for the men to march in step, but were an important part of the [[battle]]field communications system, with various [[drum roll]]s used to signal different commands from officers to troops.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genealogyforum.com/gfaol/resource/Military/Drummer.htm U.S. Civil War History &amp; Genealogy – The Drummer Boys], genealogyforum.com&lt;/ref&gt; By the second half of the 18th century, most, -if not all western armies had a standardized set of marches and signals to be played, often accompanied by fifers.

==The idea of the "Drummer Boy"==
The romantic idea about drummers is that they were young boys (for instance the Christmas carol "The Little Drummer Boy", or the painting "Steady the Drums"). The fact, though, is that drummers were more often adult men, recruited like the common soldiers. Fifers, on the other hand, being not an official part of the regiments early on, were usually recruited from young boys. During the second half of the 19th century, it was accepted in many western armies that under aged boys served as drummers. 

Although there were usually official age limits, these were often ignored; the youngest boys were sometimes treated as [[mascot]]s by the adult soldiers. The life of a drummer boy appeared rather glamorous and as a result, boys would sometimes run away from home to enlist.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ArxMQHZlEOsC&amp;pg=PA107 Albert A. Nofi, ''A Civil War Treasury: Being a Miscellany of Arms and Artillery, Facts and Figures, Legends and Lore'' Da Capo Press 1992 (p.107)]&lt;/ref&gt; Other boys may have been the sons or orphans of soldiers serving in the same unit.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_NcDBlj7htsC&amp;pg=PA274 Richard Holmes, ''Soldiers: Army Lives and Loyalties from Redcoats to Dusty Warriors'', Harper Press 2011 (p.275)]&lt;/ref&gt; The image of a small child in the midst of battle was seen as deeply poignant by 19th-century artists, and idealised boy drummers were frequently depicted in paintings, sculpture and poetry.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=h_C8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA101 J. W. M. Hichberger, ''Images of the Army: The Military in British Art, 1815–1914''], Manchester University Press 1988, {{ISBN|0-7190-2575-3}} (p.101)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Child soldier in the US Civil War.jpg|thumb|left|Drummer boy [[John Clem]] during the [[American Civil War]].]]
[[Nathan Futrell]] (1773–1829) was said to have been the youngest drummer boy in the [[American War of Independence]]; he joined the North Carolina Continental Militia at the age of 7.

In 1793, [[Joseph Bara]], a 14-year-old [[French Revolutionary Army|French Republican]] drummer at the time of the [[War in the Vendée]], was killed by royalist counter-revolutionaries, supposedly while he was shouting "Long live the Republic!". His body was interred at the [[Panthéon]] along with other national heroes.&lt;ref&gt;Dupuy, Pascal, [http://www.histoire-image.org/site/oeuvre/analyse.php?i=344 ''La Mort de Bara''] http://www.histoire-image.org ''L’Histoire par l’image'' (in French). Retrieved: 19 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

[[André Estienne]] was a drummer with [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s army at the [[Battle of the Bridge of Arcole]] in 1796, where he led his [[battalion]] across a river while holding his drum over his head, and on reaching the far bank, beat the "charge". This led to the capture of the bridge and the rout of the [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] army. Despite being 19 years old, he became famous as ''Le Petit Tambour d'Arcole'' ({{lang-fr|The Little Drummer of Arcole}}), and is depicted in the [[Panthéon, Paris|Panthéon in Paris]] and on the [[Arc de Triomphe]], also in paintings by [[Charles Thévenin]] and [[Horace Vernet]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.napoleon.org/en%5Ccollectors_corner%5Cobject%5Cfiles%5C480511.asp Fondation Napoléon – Honorary drumsticks presented to the drummer of Arcole] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120528033336/http://www.napoleon.org/en%5Ccollectors_corner%5Cobject%5Cfiles%5C480511.asp |date=May 28, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 April 1855, at the [[Siege of Sevastopol (1854–1855)|Siege of Sevastopol]] during the [[Crimean War]], there was a bayonet attack by the British [[77th (East Middlesex) Regiment of Foot|77th Regiment of Foot]] on some rifle pits which the Russians were using to [[Sniper|snipe]] at British positions. Accompanying the attack was an unnamed drummer boy of the 77th, who seeing a Russian boy trumpeter trying to escape, caught hold of him and beat him with his fists "in truly British fashion" until he surrendered. The boy presented the Russian trumpet to Sir [[George Brown (British Army officer)|George Brown]] and he was later rewarded by General [[FitzRoy Somerset, 1st Baron Raglan|Lord Raglan]], the British commander.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Carter (writer)|Thomas Carter]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=5QoLAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA77 ''Medals of the British Army: and How They Were Won: Volume 1'', Groombridge and Son, London 1861 (p.77)]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Siege of Lucknow]] during the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]], 12-year-old Drummer Ross of the [[93rd Highlanders]] signalled the arrival of his regiment to the besieged garrison, by climbing the spire of the [[Shah Najaf Mosque]] and playing the regimental march on his bugle, while under heavy fire from the rebel forces.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_NcDBlj7htsC&amp;pg=PA274 Holmes, (p.275)]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 November at the [[Second Battle of Cawnpore]], 15-year-old [[Thomas Flynn (VC)|Thomas Flynn]], a drummer with the [[64th Regiment of Foot]], was awarded the [[Victoria Cross]]. "During a charge on the enemy's guns, Drummer Flynn, although wounded himself, engaged in a hand-to-hand encounter with two of the rebel artillerymen". He remains the youngest recipient of the medal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.athloneheritage.com/famo/tflinn.html Athlone Heritage – Drummer Thomas Flynn VC]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bank of England (14167257336).jpg|thumb|right|The night guard (including, in the foreground, a young drummer wearing a [[Corps of drums|laced tunic]] and carrying a bugle) arriving at the [[Bank of England]], 1906.]]

Thirteen-year-old [[Charles E. King (soldier)|Charles King]] was the youngest soldier killed in the entire [[American Civil War]] (1861–1865). Charles enlisted in the [[49th Pennsylvania Infantry|49th Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry]] with the reluctant permission of his father at the age of 12 years, 5 months and 9 days. On September 17, 1862 at the [[Battle of Antietam]] he was mortally wounded near or in the area of the [[East Woods]], carried from the field and died three days later. Twelve-year-old drummer boy [[William Black (soldier)|William Black]] was the youngest recorded person wounded in battle during the [[American Civil War]]. [[John Clem]], who had unofficially joined a Union Army regiment at the age of 9 as a drummer and mascot, became famous as "The Drummer Boy of [[Battle of Chickamauga|Chickamauga]]" where he played a "long roll" and shot a Confederate officer who had demanded his surrender. An 11-year-old drummer in the Confederate [[Orphan Brigade]], known only as "Little Oirish", was credited with rallying troops at the [[Battle of Shiloh]] by taking up the [[Colours, standards and guidons|regimental colors]] at a critical moment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ArxMQHZlEOsC&amp;pg=PA107 Nofi, (p.108)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Costa Rica]], the Drummer boy [[Juan Santamaría]] died in an act of self-sacrifice in the war against the US Filibuster [[William Walker (filibuster)|William Walker]] and is commemorated as his country's [[Folk hero|National Hero]].{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

==Decline==
[[File:Isandhlwana.jpg|thumb|right|''The Last Stand at Isandlwana'' by C E Fripp shows a small drummer boy in the ranks, despite the youngest soldier present being over 16 years old]]
The use of drums beyond the parade ground declined rapidly as the 19th century progressed, being replaced by the [[bugle]] in the signalling role, although it was often the drummers who were required to play them. A widely reported incident at the [[Battle of Isandlwana]] during the [[Anglo-Zulu War]] of 1879, spelled the end of boys being sent on active service by the [[British Army]]. Part of the British force returned to their camp at night to find that it had been overrun by the [[Zulu Kingdom|Zulu]] army a few hours previously. An eyewitness reported that "Even the little drummer boys that we had in the band, they were hung up on hooks, and opened like sheep. It was a pitiful sight". Doubt has since been cast on this account, since the youngest drummer to be killed was 18, and the youngest boy present was 16.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=s2mbl5xPOcUC&amp;pg=PP150 Ian Knight, ''Zulu Rising: The Epic Story of iSandlwana and Rorke's Drift'', Pan Books 2011] {{ISBN|978-0330445931}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, [[Charles Edwin Fripp]]'s famous painting, ''The Last Stand at Isandlwana'', shows a small blond-haired boy amongst the adult soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Brwn2jz-mMMC&amp;pg=PA64 Ian Knight, ''Isandlwana 1879: The Great Zulu Victory''], Osprey Publishing Limited 2002, {{ISBN|1-84176-511-2}} (p.64)&lt;/ref&gt;
The US Army kept drummers and fifers with the infantry, until they were finally abolished in the field in 1917. Drums, like other instruments, were now only used for parades and ceremonies.

'''Federico Eulogio Malo Andrade''' (5 July 1859 – 14 February 1932) was an [[Ecuador]]ian [[entrepreneur]] and prominent figure who made a [[Wealth|fortune]] from the [[export]]ation of [[panama hat]]s and [[quinine]], and with the foundation of financial institutions. He was born in [[Cuenca (Ecuador)|Cuenca]], on July 5, 1859, to Dr. Luis Malo Valdivieso, a lawyer and [[lieutenant colonel]] who also was a rich [[merchant]], and Mrs. Jesús Andrade Morales, niece of the President of Ecuador, Dr. Jeronimo Carrion y Palacio.

In 1877, he traveled to Europe to live in [[Paris]] and [[London]], where he studied economy and law. He stayed there until 1879, and returned to Cuenca, where he was established until 1883, when he returned to Paris. He became a friend of Juan Montalvo, an Ecuadorian writer resident there. When he finally went back to Cuenca in 1887, he married Mrs. Leticia de Andrade Chiriboga (1870–1935) on March 23, 1888. They had eleven children. That was the moment in his life where he became a very important person in Cuenca; he was Secretary of the City Council in 1891, French and English teacher at Benigno Malo National College of Cuenca in 1892, Congressman in 1896, Rector of Benigno Malo National College in 1896-1900; 1901–1906 and 1914–1916, President of the City Council in 1903, President of Azuay's Liberal Party in 1912, Governor of Azuay between 1916 and 1920, Senator in 1924, etc.

In 1912, he imported from London to Cuenca, the first automobile that arrived to the city. In 1913, he founded Cuenca's first Bank, ''Banco del Azuay'', and in 1919, Cuenca's Commerce Chamber. He participated in the opening of a branch of Ecuador's Central Bank in Cuenca, in 1928, of which he became President. He died in his city, on February 14, 1932, aged 72.

Market incentives, such as reflected in [[price]]s of outputs and inputs, are theorized to attract [[factors of production]], including labor,  into activities according to [[comparative advantage]], that is,  for which they each have a low [[opportunity cost]]. The factor owners then use their increased income from such specialization to buy more-valued [[good (economics)|goods]] of which they would otherwise be high-cost producers, hence their ''gains from trade''.  The concept may be applied to an entire economy for the alternatives of [[autarky]] (no trade) or trade.  A measure of total gains from trade is the sum of [[consumer surplus]] and producer [[Profit (economics)|profits]] or,  more roughly, the increased output from specialization in production with resulting trade.&lt;ref&gt;Paul A. Samuelson and William D. Nordhaus, 2004. ''Economics'', ch. 12, 15, "Comparative Advantage among Nations" section," "Glossary of Terms," Gains from trade.&lt;/ref&gt;  Gains from trade may also refer to net benefits to a country from lowering barriers to trade such as [[tariffs]] on [[import]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alan Deardorff|Alan V. Deardorff]], ''Glossary of International Economics]'', 2006. [http://www-personal.umich.edu/~alandear/glossary/g.html#GainsFromTrade "Gains from trade."]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Ricardo]] in 1817 first clearly stated and proved the principle of comparative advantage,&lt;ref&gt;David Ricardo, 1817.  ''On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation''.&lt;/ref&gt;  termed a "fundamental analytical explanation" for the source of gains from trade.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ronald Findlay]], 2008. "comparative advantage,"  ''The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics'', 2nd Edition, 1st paragraph. [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_C000254&amp;edition=current&amp;q=comparative%20advantage&amp;topicid=&amp;result_number=1 Abstract].&lt;/ref&gt; But from publication of [[Adam Smith]]'s ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' in 1776, it was  widely argued, that, with competition and absent market [[distortions (economics)|distortions]],  such gains are positive in moving toward [[free trade]] and away from autarky or prohibitively high import [[tariffs]].  Rigorous early contemporary statements of the conditions under which this proposition holds are found in Samuelson in 1939 and 1962.&lt;ref&gt;• Paul A. Samuelson, 1939.

"The Gains from International Trade Once Again," ''Economic Journal'', 72(288), pp. [http://stevereads.com/papers_to_read/the_gains_from_international_trade_once_again.pdf 820-829.]&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • Alan V. Deardorff, 2006.

Kemp and Henry Y. Wan, Jr., 1972. "The Gains from Free Trade," ''International Economic Review'', 13(3), pp. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2525840 509]-522.&lt;/ref&gt;

It does not follow that no tariffs are the best an economy could do.  Rather, a large economy might be able to set taxes and subsidies to its benefit at the expense of other economies.  Later results of Kemp and others showed that in an Arrow-Debreu world with a system of [[lump sum tax|lump-sum]] compensatory mechanisms, corresponding to a [[customs union]] for a given subset set of countries (described by free trade among a group of economies and a common set of tariffs), there is a common set of ''world''' tariffs such that no country would be worse off than in the smaller customs union. The suggestion is that if a customs union has advantages for an economy, there is a worldwide customs union that is at least as good for each country in the world.&lt;ref&gt;• Murray C. Kemp 1987.

==Measurement==

[[Classical economist]]s maintain that there are two methods to measure the gains from trade: 1) [[international trade]] increases [[national income]] which helps us to get low priced imports; 2) gains are measured in [[terms of trade]]. To measure the gains from the trade, comparison of a country's [[cost of production]] with a foreign country's cost of production for the same product is required. However, it is very difficult to acquire the knowledge of cost of production and cost of imports in a domestic country. Therefore, terms of trade method is preferable to measure the gains from trade.

==Factors affecting gains from trade==

There are several factors which determine the gains from international trade:

# Differences in cost ratio: The gains from international trade depends upon the cost ratios of differences in comparative cost ratios in the two trading countries. The smaller the difference between exchange rate and cost of production the smaller the gains from trade and vice versa.
# Demand and supply: If a country has elastic demand and supply gains the gains from trade are higher than if demand and supply are inelastic.
# Factor availability: International trade is based on the specialization and a country specializes depending upon the availability of factors of production. It will increase the domestic cost ratios and thereby the gains from trade.
# Size of country: If a country is small in size it is relatively easy for them to specialize in the production of one commodity and export the surplus production to a large country and can get more gains from international trade. Whereas if a country is large in size then they have to specialize in more than one good because the excess production of only one commodity can not be exported fully to a small sized country as the demand for good will reduce very frequently. So the smaller the size of the country, the larger the gain from trade.
# Terms of Trade: Gains from trade will depend upon the terms of trade. If the cost ratio and terms of trade are closer to each other more will be the gains from trade of the participating countries.
# Productive Efficiency: An increase in the productive efficiency of a country also determines its gains from trade as it lowers the cost of production and price of the goods. As a result, the country importing  gains by importing cheap goods.

==Static and dynamic gains from trade==

The gains from trade can be clad into static and dynamic gains from trades. Static Gains means the increase in social welfare as a result of maximized national output due to optimum utilization of country's factor endowments or resources. Dynamic gains from trade, are those benefits which accelerate economic growth of the participating countries.

[[Static gains]] are the result of the operation of the theory of comparative cost in the field of foreign trade. On this principle countries make the [[optimum use]] of their [[available resources]] so that their national output is greater which also raises the level of social welfare in the country. When there is an introduction of foreign trade in the economy the result is called the static gains from trade.

[[Dynamic gains]] from trade relate to economic development of the economy. Specialization of the country for the production of best suited commodities which result in a large volume of quality production which promotes growth. Thus the extension of domestic market to foreign market will accelerate economic growth.

==Career==
Jack joined his father's law firm, ''Pritzker &amp; Pritzker'', along with his brothers, [[Abram Nicholas Pritzker|Abram]] and [[Harry Nicholas Pritzker|Harry]].&lt;ref name=CNNMoney /&gt; Harry specialized in criminal law, Abram (called Abe and later A.

Using ''Pritzker &amp; Pritzker'', they shielded their earnings from taxes through a series of trusts and tax code loopholes enabling them to distribute their earnings as they chose.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/December-2002/Tremors-in-the-Empire/ Chicago magazine: "Tremors in the Empire" by Shane Tritsch] December 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

His brother Abram's sons continued to grow the family business eventually buying the [[Hyatt Hotel|Hyatt]] House hotel in [[Los Angeles]] in 1957 forming the cornerstone of their hotel chain. His nephew Robert created a conglomerate of a multitude of manufacturing companies which grew into the multibillion-dollar [[Marmon Group]]. Marmon was diversified to include manufacturing concerns ranging from lumber to railroad box cars and travel industry staples.  It composed half of the family's wealth. On December 25, 2007, it was announced that Warren Buffett, through [[Berkshire Hathaway]], would purchase 60% of the Marmon Group from the Pritzkers for $4.5 Billion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/26/business/26deal.html New York Times: "Rapidly, Buffett Secures a Deal for $4.5 Billion" By VIKAS BAJAJ] December 26, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Pritzker was married to [[Rhoda Pritzker|Rhoda Goldberg]]; they had one child: [[Nicholas J. Pritzker]] who is chairman of the board and CEO of the Hyatt Development Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/19990206/ISSUE01/10001555?template=printart Crain's Chicago Business: "TORCH GETS PASSED AT PRITZKERS' MEGA-EMPIRE" by Paul Merrion] February 06, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Juan Mauricio Wurmser''' is a founding partner, President and [[CEO]] of [[Wurmser Ogilvy &amp; Mather]], the O&amp;M advertising firm in [[Guatemala]]. He is also founding partner and [[Chairman of Hill + Knowlton Strategies]] [[Guatemala]], the local subsidiary of this international public relations firm. He is a member of the Ogilvy Latina Executive Committee where he represents the Central American and Caribbean operations. Mr. Wurmser is involved in other business ventures in the marketing services and communications areas that include 141 Soho Square, MEC, Mindshare and Mediacom, all part of the WPP Group. He has more than 30 years of experience in the marketing of consumer goods throughout Latin America and a history of active participation in business chambers and organizations, as well as a spell of public service with the government of [[Guatemala]] .

==Prior History==
Prior to joining WO&amp;M and [[Hill and Knowlton]] [[Guatemala]] in mid-1998, Mr. Wurmser served as [[Minister of Economy]] of [[Guatemala]]. He was responsible for trade and industry promotion - with special emphasis on attracting foreign investment - and coordinated the regional and [[world|global]] economic integration efforts of the [[Arzú]] administration. He was a key member of the [[Guatemala]]n Economic Cabinet and sat on the Monetary Board where monetary, credit and exchange policies were defined. He was also Chairman of the Board of Governors of the [[Central American]] [[Bank of Economic]] Integration between 1997 and 1998.

Before taking up public service, Mr. Wurmser was responsible for developing and implementing the franchise program of [[Pollo Campero]], one of the most successful fast food restaurant chains in [[Central America]], which led to its [[international]] expansion.

His years as a corporate [[marketing]] executive include early assignments with the [[Guatemala]] subsidiaries of Warner Lambert, Avon, and [[Colgate-Palmolive]], before joining British American Tobacco in 1978, a company that he served for 15 years in [[Guatemala]], [[Panama]], [[Spain]], [[Mexico]], and [[Argentina]] before returning to [[Guatemala]] as President and General Manager of its local subsidiary.

Juan Mauricio has been committed to fostering Guatemala' s viability through his participation in business chambers and organisations through the years.

More recently, he was chosen by The Guatemalan Management Association as CEO of the Year 2015, one of the most coveted awards of the regional business community, followed by the early 2016 recognition as Guatemala's Entrepreneur of the Year by the Central American edition of The Economist magazine.

In mid 2016, affiliation agreements were signed by the Wurmser Communications Group with MEC and Mindshare, two of the global premier Media Investment Management companies, thus expanding further the WPP Group footprint in Guatemala and the Central American region.

==Other information==
A native of Guatemala [[City]], Mr. Wurmser holds a B.S. in business administration from [[The College of New Jersey]] (formerly Trenton State College) and also attended the graduate school of business of [[Universidad Francisco Marroquín]] in [[Guatemala]].

Mr. Wurmser has been a member of the Board of Directors of the Chamber of Industry of [[Guatemala]], was Chairman of the Business Chamber of [[Guatemala]] in 1993 and also sat on the Board of Directors of the [[American Chamber of Commerce]] of [[Guatemala]] ([[AMCHAM]]) in 2009. He has been a board member of the [[Guatemala]]n [[Advertising Association]] ([[UGAP]]) over the years, having chaired it in 2001 and in 2013-2014.  At present, he is also a member of the [[Board of Trustees]] of the [[Guatemala]] Development Foundation ([[FUNDESA]]) .

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6006">The '''Kroll process''' is a [[pyrometallurgical]] industrial  process used to produce metallic [[titanium]].  It was invented in 1940 by [[William J. Kroll]] in [[Luxembourg]].  After moving to the United States, Kroll further developed the method for the production of [[zirconium]]. The Kroll process replaced the [[Hunter process]] for almost all commercial production.&lt;ref&gt;Holleman, A. F.; Wiberg, E. "Inorganic Chemistry" Academic Press: San Diego, 2001. {{ISBN|0-12-352651-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
Prior to the Kroll process, [[titanium]] is separated from its ores by the [[chloride process]]. For this process, the feedstock consists of refined [[rutile]] or [[ilmenite]].  This mixture reduced with petroleum-derived coke in a [[fluidized bed reactor]] at 1000&amp;nbsp;°C.  The resulting mixture is then treated with [[chlorine]] gas, affording TiCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and other volatile chlorides, which are subsequently separated by continuous [[fractional distillation]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;chem&gt;FeTiO3 + C -&gt; Fe + TiO2 + CO&lt;/chem&gt;
:&lt;chem&gt;TiO2 + 2C + 2Cl2 -&gt; TiCl4 + 2CO&lt;/chem&gt;

In the Kroll process, the TiCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is reduced by liquid magnesium at 800–850&amp;nbsp;°C in a [[stainless steel]] retort to ensure complete reduction:&lt;ref&gt;Habashi, F. (ed.) Handbook of Extractive Metallurgy, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|authors=Heinz Sibum, Volker Günther, Oskar Roidl, Fathi Habashi, Hans Uwe Wolf|title=Titanium, Titanium Alloys, and Titanium Compounds|encyclopedia=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|year=2005|publisher=Wiley-VCH|location=Weinheim|doi=10.1002/14356007.a27_095}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;chem&gt;TiCl4 + 2Mg -&gt; Ti + 2MgCl2&lt;/chem&gt;

Complications result from partial reduction of the TiCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, giving to the lower chlorides [[Titanium(II) chloride|TiCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[Titanium(III) chloride|TiCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]].  The [[magnesium chloride|MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] can be further refined back to magnesium.  &lt;!-- seems too detailed an inexplicable as well given the subsequent text "After several days, so commented out: reaction stops, the pressure rises, and the spongy titanium is crushed and melted into an [[ingot]].--&gt;  The resulting porous metallic titanium sponge is purified by [[Tank leaching|leaching]] or heated [[vacuum distillation]]. The sponge is jackhammered out, crushed, and pressed before it is melted in a consumable carbon electrode vacuum [[Electric arc furnace|arc furnace]].  The melted [[ingot]] is allowed to solidify under [[vacuum]].  It is often remelted to remove inclusions and ensure uniformity.  These melting steps add to the cost of the product.  Titanium is about six times as expensive as stainless steel.

In the [[Hunter process]], which is not commercial, the TiCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; from the chloride process is reduced to the metal by sodium.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt;

==History and subsequent developments==
Many methods have been applied to the production of titanium metal, beginning with a report in 1887 by Nilsen and Pettersen using sodium, which was optimized  into the commercial [[Hunter process]]. In the 1920s van Arkel had described the thermal decomposition of [[titanium tetraiodide]] to give highly pure titanium. Titanium tetrachloride was found to reduce with [[hydrogen]] at high temperatures to give hydrides that can be thermally processed to the pure metal. With this background, Kroll developed both new reductants and new apparatus for the reduction of titanium tetrachloride. Its high reactivity toward trace amounts of water and other metal oxides presented challenges. Significant success came with the use of [[calcium]] as a reductant, but the resulting still contained significant oxide impurities.&lt;ref&gt;W. Kroll “Verformbares Titan und Zirkon” (Eng: Ductile Titanium and Zirconium) Zeitschrift für anorganische und allgemeine Chemie Volume 234, p. 42-50. {{DOI|10.1002/zaac.19372340105}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major success using [[magnesium]] at 1000&amp;nbsp;°C using a molybdenum clad reactor, as reported to the Electrochemical Society in Ottawa.&lt;ref&gt;W. J. Kroll, “The Production of Ductile Titanium” Transactions of the Electrochemical Society volume 78 (1940) 35–47.&lt;/ref&gt; Kroll's titanium was highly ductile reflecting its high purity. The Kroll process displaced the Hunter process and continues to be the dominant technology for the production of titanium metal, as well as driving the majority of the world's production of magnesium metal.

Other technologies are competing with the Kroll process. One process involves [[electrolysis]] of a [[molten salt]]. Problems with this process include "redox recycling," the failure of the diaphragm, and dendritic deposition in the electrolyte solution. Another process, the [[FFC Cambridge process]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=G. Z. Chen |author2=D. J. Fray |author3=T. W. Farthing | title = Direct Electrochemical Reduction of Titanium Dioxide to Titanium in Molten Calcium Chloride | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | year = 2000 | volume = 407 | pages = 361–4 | doi = 10.1038/35030069 | pmid = 11014188 | issue = 6802|bibcode = 2000Natur.407..361C }}&lt;/ref&gt; has been patented for a solid electrolytic solution, and its implementation would eliminate the titanium-sponge processing. Also in development is a pyrometallurgical route that involves the reduction of an intermediate form of titanium with aluminium. It combines the advantages of pyrometallurgy and a cheap reductant.

She is the great-granddaughter of [[Conrad Hilton]], the founder of [[Hilton Hotels &amp; Resorts|Hilton Hotels]]. Born in [[New York City]] and raised there and in [[Beverly Hills, California]], Hilton began her modeling career as a teenager when she signed with New York-based modeling development agency [[Trump Model Management]]. Her lifestyle made her a feature of entertainment news and tabloid magazines, and Hilton was proclaimed "New York's leading [[It girl]]" in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.biography.com/people/paris-hilton-11271420?page=1|title=Paris Hilton Biodata|publisher=Biography.com|accessdate=August 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, a [[Celebrity sex tape|sex tape]] with Hilton and her then-boyfriend [[Rick Salomon]], later released as ''[[1 Night in Paris]]'', was leaked to the public. Released only three weeks before the premiere of the reality television series ''[[The Simple Life]]'', in which she starred alongside her long-time friend [[Nicole Richie]], the sex tape became a media sensation.

In 2004, Hilton released her book ''[[Confessions of an Heiress]]'', which became a [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' Best Seller]], in 2005, she appeared in the horror film ''[[House of Wax (2005 film)|House of Wax]]'', and in 2006, her self-titled album, ''[[Paris (Paris Hilton album)|Paris]]'', was released worldwide; it reached number six on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paris Hilton's Music|url=http://www.parishiltonsite.net/music.php|publisher=Parishiltonsite.net|accessdate=September 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; with her debut single, "[[Stars Are Blind]]", quickly becoming a hit around the world. Hilton returned to reality television in 2008 with ''[[Paris Hilton's My New BFF]]'' and its two [[Spin-off (media)|spin-offs]]: ''[[Paris Hilton's British Best Friend]]'' (2009) and ''[[Paris Hilton's Dubai BFF]]'' (2009), and again in 2011, with [[Oxygen (TV channel)|Oxygen]] series ''[[The World According to Paris]]''.

In 2012, Hilton made her debut as a [[Disc jockey|DJ]] at the [[São Paulo]] Pop Music Festival. Initially panned by critics, she has become one of the highest-paid celebrity DJs, and between 2013 and 2017, held the "Paris Hilton: Foam &amp; Diamonds"  residence at the [[Amnesia (nightclub)|Amnesia nightclub]] in [[Ibiza]]. She signed a record deal with [[Cash Money Records]] in 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/oct/23/paris-hilton-earns-up-to-1m-single-dj-set|title=Paris Hilton earns up to $1 million per DJ set|date=October 23, 2014|work=[[theguardian.com]]|publisher=theguardian|accessdate=October 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has since released the singles "[[Good Time (Paris Hilton song)|Good Time]]" (2013), "[[Come Alive (Paris Hilton song)|Come Alive]]" (2014), "[[High Off My Love]]" (2015), and "[[I Need You (Paris Hilton song)|I Need You]]" (2018).

Critics suggest that Hilton epitomizes being [[famous for being famous]],&lt;ref name="phfame" /&gt; exemplifying the ''[[celebutante]]'' phenomenon—a celebrity for no particularly identifiable reason other than inherited wealth and lavish lifestyle. She has been credited with influencing the revival of the term during the early-to-mid 2000s, and once remarked: "Back in the day, when I first came into this world, there was no one like it. It was almost like creating a new genre, and I think before its time. [...] Now we see it all coming back, and everyone’s calling me the OG, and it’s like, yeah.

In 2009, a quiet relationship between Hilton and the tabloids led entertainment writers to suggest that her popularity had waned; she was the subject of a   [[CNN]] story, asking, "Why has Paris Hilton disappeared?". This suspicion was reinforced in June 2011 when her reality show, ''The World According to Paris'', had low ratings and Hilton walked out during an interview with ''[[Good Morning America]]'' when asked if she worried about her moment having passed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2011/07/20/paris-hilton-storms-out-good-morning-america-interview-over-questions-about-her/ |title=Paris Hilton Storms Out of 'Good Morning America' Interview Over Questions About Her Fame |publisher=Fox News |accessdate=August 10, 2012 |date=July 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Schwartz |first=Alison |url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20511528,00.html |title=Paris Hilton Walks Out of Interview with ABC News – Scandals &amp; Feuds, Good Morning America, Paris Hilton |work=People |date=July 20, 2011 |accessdate=August 10, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120204113/http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20511528,00.html |archivedate=November 20, 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, following her involvement with the filming of ''The Bling Ring'' and her deal with [[Cash Money Records]] in 2013, she became a trending topic worldwide on Twitter&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ok.co.uk/celebrity-news/view/63350/Paris-Hilton-music-deal-news-sends-Twitter-into-meltdown|title=Paris Hilton music deal news sends Twitter into meltdown|publisher=Ok.co.uk|date=May 23, 2013|accessdate=September 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and media outlets noted 2013 as Hilton's "pop culture renaissance" year.

On September 6, 2007, Hilton filed an [[injunction]] lawsuit against [[Hallmark Cards]] Inc., titled ''Hilton v.

The card is titled "Paris's First Day as a Waitress" with a photograph of Hilton's face on a cartoon of a waitress serving a plate of food, with a dialogue bubble saying "Don't touch that, it's hot" (which had a [[registered trademark]] on February 13, 2007). Hilton's attorney Brent Blakely said that the [[Copyright infringement|infringement]] damages would be based on profits from the greeting cards.

Between 2008 and 2009, Hilton's home was burgled several times by the [[Bling Ring]], a group of fashion-motivated thieves.

===Relationships===
Throughout her life, Hilton's personal life, and especially her extensive list of relationships and romantic associations with other high-profile figures, has drawn a large amount of media attention and public disapproval.&lt;ref&gt;https://galoremag.com/paris-hiltons-dating-history/&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, for instance, the then-19-year-old rose tabloids' attention when she and [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] were seen together on the NYC late-night circuit. That led to Hilton adamantly deny to ''Vanity Fair'', in one of her first magazine profiles, that they were involved.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.eonline.com/news/903420/paris-hilton-s-epic-romantic-history-all-the-hookups-breakups-drama-you-forgot-about&lt;/ref&gt; She dated actor [[Edward Furlong]] in 2000, and poker player [[Rick Salomon]], with whom she filmed her sex tape, circa early 2000s.&lt;ref name="usmag"&gt;https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/pictures/paris-hiltons-complete-dating-history/josh-henderson-4/&lt;/ref&gt; She was engaged to fashion model Jason Shaw from 2002 to 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Parvizi|first=Lauren|url=http://blog.sfgate.com/dailydish/2010/04/30/paris-hilton-confirms-she-and-ex-jason-shaw-are-very-close|title=Paris Hilton confirms she and ex Jason Shaw are 'very close'|publisher=Blog.sfgate.com|date=April 30, 2010|accessdate=January 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have reportedly remained friends since their split.

"Paris was the worst person in the world for me to hook up with," he wrote. "[She] fed my worst impulses as far as partying."&lt;ref name="usmag" /&gt;

===Sex tape===
In 2003, a [[celebrity sex tape|sex tape]] featuring Hilton and then-boyfriend Rick Salomon was leaked onto the Internet. Shortly afterward, Salomon filed a lawsuit against the company that distributed the tape, and against the Hilton family, whom he accused of tarnishing his reputation by suggesting that he had exploited Hilton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,544778,00.html|title=Shame Game |last=Hiatt|first=Brian |date=November 18, 2003|publisher=ew.com|accessdate=December 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hilton later sued the company that released the tape, Kahatani Ltd., for $30 million for violation of privacy and emotional distress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/TECH/internet/02/09/paris.lawsuit.reut/|title=Paris Hilton sues over Internet sex tape|date=February 9, 2004|publisher=cnn.com|accessdate=December 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2004, Salomon began distributing the tape himself through the adult film company [[Red Light District Video]] under the title ''[[1 Night in Paris]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,630669,00.html|title=X-Rated Paris Tape Goes to Home Video|last=Silverman|first=Stephen M. |date=April 30, 2004|publisher=people.com|accessdate=December 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2004, Salomon dropped his lawsuit against the Hilton family after Paris Hilton's privacy lawsuit was thrown out of court.

===Stalking incidents===
In August 2010, a man identified as Nathan Lee Parada, was arrested after security men spotted him wielding two knives outside Hilton's house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://latimesblogs.latimes.com/gossip/2010/08/paris-hilton-break-in-attempt-man-charged.html|title=Nathan Lee Parada charged in Paris Hilton break-in|date=August 27, 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was later found guilty of one felony count of attempted first-degree residential burglary, and was sentenced to two years in state prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eonline.com/news/250004/paris-hilton-burglar-sentenced-to-two-years-in-state-prison|title=Paris Hilton Burglar Sentenced to Two Years in State Prison|date=June 30, 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2010, a man named James Rainford allegedly bicycled past guards at the entrance to her gated community, went to her house and began pounding on her door. He was arrested, and earned three years' probation, along with a restraining order from Hilton. In April 2011, Rainford was arrested a second time for attacking her then-boyfriend Cy Waits outside Van Nuys Superior Court, where Hilton was headed to testify against Nathan Lee Parada, and in July, he was arrested again outside her [[Malibu, California|Malibu]] beach house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/paris-hiltons-accused-stalker-to-stand-trial/|title=Paris Hilton's accused stalker to stand trial|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://latimesblogs.latimes.com/gossip/2011/07/paris-hilton-stalker-intruder-james-rainford-cy-waits.html|title=Paris Hilton stalker James Rainford arrested again, outside her Malibu home|date=July 5, 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was subsequently charged with two felony stalking counts and three misdemeanor counts of disobeying a court order,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/man-is-charged-with-stalking-paris-hilton/|title=Man is charged with stalking Paris Hilton|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but a judge found him to be "mentally incompetent to stand trial" and was sent to a state mental hospital.

In October 2014, a German man identified as Lukas Redanz, who was completely covered with tattoos of Hilton and appeared to be "extremely drunk", repeatedly went to her gated community to see her. Guards called the police and the man was arrested for possession of cocaine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tmz.com/2014/02/10/paris-hilton-stalker-tattoo-german/|title=Paris Hilton -- My Stalker Came Back -- He'sTatted Up With Me|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Department of Defense ==

Brinkley accepted an appointment as Deputy Undersecretary of Defense in 2004.

=== Business Transformation Agency ===

In partnership with Deputy Undersecretary of Defense for Financial Management [[Thomas Modly]], Brinkley consolidated Department-wide business systems used by the [[Department of the Army]], [[Department of the Navy]] and [[Department of the Air Force]] into the [[Business Transformation Agency]]. The work of the Business Transformation Agency was lauded by the [[Government Accountability Office]]&lt;ref&gt;http://fcw.com/articles/2006/03/27/business-transformation-is-turning-heads.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; for streamlining departmental business systems.

=== Task Force for Business and Stability Operations ===

In 2006, under the direction of [[Deputy Secretary of Defense]] [[Gordon R. England|Gordon England]], Brinkley established the [[Task Force for Business and Stability Operations]], charged with restoring normal economic activity in Iraq during widespread conflict in the [[Iraq War]], and to streamline and transform the Department's contracting process and systems in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;https://files.secureserver.net/0sqvhCwlN6rqS8&lt;/ref&gt; While interdepartmental disagreements took place given the nature of the TFBSO's directives,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/13/AR2007051301165.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://money.cnn.com/2007/08/31/magazines/fortune/iraq_inc.fortune/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt; the task force focused on making business development a component of a broader military counter-insurgency.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/MH05Df02.html&lt;/ref&gt;  At its peak in Iraq, TFBSO had over 350 professionals deployed in every province of the country, including large numbers of civilian business leaders and agriculture experts from the American private sector and academia.&lt;ref name="csis"&gt;http://csis.org/publication/final-report-lessons-learned&lt;/ref&gt; Over 200 international companies visited Iraq as part of the foreign direct investment initiative sponsored by TFBSO, with 80 initiating business activity as a result of their engagement. The Task Force directly facilitated over $8 billion in foreign direct investment.

In 2009, the TFBSO began work supporting the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|United States mission in Afghanistan]], placing heavy focus on rapid development of mining resources with a goal of imposing environmental and socially responsible processes for the Afghan government to finance its own security and development. TFBSO also launched aggressive efforts to encourage foreign investment in other sectors, including agriculture and information technology.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/14/world/asia/14minerals.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fastcompany.com/1761397/google-ibm-youtube-and-kabul-pentagon-hosts-afghan-tech-entrepreneurs-us&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/09/01/in-afghanistan-roya-mahboob-connects-girls-with-computers.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-01-06/pentagon-s-brinkley-plays-afghan-matchmaker-for-ibm-jpmorgan.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to its work in Afghanistan and Iraq, TFBSO projects supported the [[Embassy of the United States, Islamabad|US Embassy in Islamabad]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.icci.com.pk/event/detail/322&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[United States Africa Command]] in Rwanda and Sudan.

=== Recognition ===
Brinkley received the [[Distinguished Public Service Medal]], the highest civilian award conferred by the Department of Defense, for his service in establishing and leading the TFBSO.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.econstability.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Brinkley_Distinguished_Public_Service_Medal_28.06.2011.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; He also received the [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Joint Distinguished Civilian Service Award|Joint Distinguished Civilian Service Award]], the highest civilian award conferred by the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]], for his contributions to the stabilization of Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.econstability.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Brinkley_Joint_Distinguished_Civilian_Service_Award_22.03.2011.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, he received the Eagle Award, an annual award for the outstanding civilian information technology leader in the federal government, for his work leading defense business modernization.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.govhealthit.com/news/eagle-awards-go-baird-brinkley&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 2010, Brinkley and four members of his team were meeting with a hotel manager when a powerful car bomb detonated 30 meters from their conference room in downtown Baghdad. The blast destroyed the building's exterior façade and shattered windows, causing numerous casualties. Despite sustaining significant concussive and shrapnel injuries requiring medical care, all five individuals returned to work virtually without interruption under hazardous security conditions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.econstability.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Medical-Consult.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/26/world/middleeast/26iraq.html&lt;/ref&gt; Brinkley and the four task force members received the [[Defense of Freedom Medal]], the civilian equivalent of the [[Purple Heart]], in response to this incident.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.econstability.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Defense_of_Freedom_Medal_Release_27.09.2010-1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Resignation ===
In May 2010, after four years of work in Iraq and Afghanistan, the work of the Task Force was ruled to be outside of the normal role of the Department of Defense under [[Title X]] of the [[United States Code]].  Months of Congressional engagement ensued, with [[Senate Armed Services Committee]] Chairman [[Carl Levin]] and Minority Leader [[John McCain]] urging Secretary of Defense Robert Gates in writing to retain the TFBSO.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.econstability.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/SASC-Letter.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Despite their intervention, Congress passed legislation in December 2010 to move the work of TFBSO into the [[United States Agency for International Development]] no later than October 2011 and immediately cease its operations in Iraq and Pakistan. The task force experienced subsequent resignations from most of its senior leadership. Citing inability to rebuild a leadership team for a mission limited to a six month term in Afghanistan, Brinkley resigned July 1, 2011, his departure date coinciding with the retirement of Robert Gates.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/defense-task-force-on-afghanistan-development-unravels/2011/03/22/ABe2PHSB_story.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== North America Western Asia Holdings ==
In October 2011, Brinkley co-founded North America Western Asia Holdings (NAWAH), with [[Thomas Pritzker]] serving as co-founder and chairman. According to its mission statement, NAWAH will "respect the history of the nations in which it operates, their culture and their people; commit our own capital to build and sustain great companies; partner equally with regional companies, remaining personally and professionally vested in their long-term success (and will) require our employees, suppliers, and partners operate in a transparent manner, following the highest ethical and international business standards."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nawah.com&lt;/ref&gt; In October, 2012, NAWAH reached an agreement with the Iraqi government to invest up to $14 million to modernize operations at the [[Al-Maqal Port|Port of Maqal]] in the city of [[Basra]], which has been largely inoperable since the [[Iran–Iraq War]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.porttechnology.org/news/iraq_signs_multi_million_dollar_deal_to_modernize_basras_maqal_port/&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2013, NAWAH announced the reopening of the port, marking less than one year during which NAWAH had rebuilt damaged port infrastructure and hired and trained an Iraqi workforce and management team. The port established a modern container terminal in the city center of Basra and provided a needed gateway for commercial goods into the growing Iraqi economy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nawah.com/nawah-modernizes-historic-port-of-basra/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other pursuits ==

'''Pearl Street Station''' was the first commercial central [[power station|power plant]] in the US. It was located at 255-257 [[Pearl Street (Manhattan)|Pearl Street]] in [[Manhattan]] on a site measuring {{convert|50|by|100|ft}},&lt;ref name=Josephson&gt;"Edison" by Matthew Josephson. McGraw Hill, New York, 1959, pg. 255. {{OCLC|485621}}, {{ISBN|0-07-033046-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; just south of [[Fulton Street (Manhattan)|Fulton Street]] and fired by coal. It began with six [[dynamo]]s, and it started [[electricity generation|generating electricity]] on September 4, 1882, serving an initial load of 400 lamps at 82 customers.&lt;ref&gt;Skruen uden ende, page 253, third edition&lt;/ref&gt; By 1884, Pearl Street Station was serving 508 customers with 10,164 lamps.&lt;ref name=Josephson/&gt; The station was built by the [[Edison Illuminating Company]], which was headed by [[Thomas Edison]]. The station was originally powered by custom-made Porter-Allen [[high-speed steam engine]]s designed to provide 175 [[horsepower]] at 700 rpm,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TuhQAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=PA527&amp;ots=fYvTPnqJIN&amp;dq=Armington%20%26%20Sims%20at%20pearl%20street%20station&amp;pg=PA529#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Electrical world, Volume 80, McGraw-Hill, 1922, p.529]&lt;/ref&gt; but these proved to be unreliable with their sensitive governors. They were removed and replaced with new engines from [[Armington &amp; Sims]] that proved to be much more suitable for Edison's dynamos.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TuhQAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=PA527&amp;ots=fYvTPnqJIN&amp;dq=Armington%20%26%20Sims%20at%20pearl%20street%20station&amp;pg=PA527#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Electrical world, Volume 80, McGraw-Hill, 1922]&lt;/ref&gt;

Pearl Street Station was also the world's first [[cogeneration]] plant.&lt;ref&gt;Industrial Motor Power Corp, What is Cogeneration?&lt;/ref&gt;  While the steam engines provided grid electricity, Edison made use of the thermal byproduct by distributing steam to local manufacturers, and warming nearby buildings on the same Manhattan block.

The station burned down in 1890, destroying all but one dynamo that is now kept in the [[Greenfield Village Museum]] in Dearborn, Michigan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coned.com/pearlstreet125/ 125 Years On: Pearl Street - Birthplace of the Electric Age] (Interactive Presentation), Consolidated Edison Company of New York. Last accessed: 3 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scale models==
In 1929 the Edison Company constructed three scale working models of the station. When a button was pushed, a motor turned the engines, generators, and other equipment in the model. A set of lamps connected to labelled buttons identified the various areas of the building. Cut-outs in the side of the model building allowed examination of the boilers on the first level, reciprocating steam engines and dynamos on the reinforced second level, and the control and test gear on the third and fourth levels. The models were constructed to a scale of one-half inch to the foot and were 62 inches long, 34 inches high and 13 inches wide. The models still exist and are on display at the [[Smithsonian Institution]] [[National Museum of American History]] in Washington, at the [[Consolidated Edison]] Learning Center in Long Island City, New York and at the [[The Henry Ford|Henry Ford Museum]] in Dearborn, Michigan. Up to 31 people worked on constructing the models which took about 6 months to complete.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Sulzberger, ''Pearl Street in Miniature: models of the electric generating station'',  '''IEEE Power and Energy', Volume 11 No. 2 March/April 2013, pp 76-81&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rashid al-Haj Ibrahim''' ({{lang-ar|&lt;big&gt;رشيد الحاج إبراهيم&lt;/big&gt;}}) (1889–1953) was a [[Palestinian people|Palestinian Arab]] banker and a leader of the [[Independence Party (Palestine)|Independence Party of Palestine]] (''al-Istiqlal''). He was one of the most influential Arab leaders of Haifa in the first half of the 20th century and played a leading role in both the [[1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine|1936–39 Arab revolt]] and the [[Battle of Haifa (1948)|1948 Battle of Haifa]].

==Early life and background==
Al-Haj Ibrahim was born in [[Haifa]] in 1889 in the [[Ottoman Empire]] to a middle-class mercantile family, al-Haj Ibrahim.&lt;ref name="Matthews267"/&gt; The al-Haj Ibrahim family immigrated to Palestine from western [[North Africa]] and had a military past. They gained a reputation in trade and commerce and held considerable influence in Haifa.&lt;ref name="Yazbak"/&gt; Rashid was mostly self-educated, but he enrolled in Haifa's government-run secondary school and the Alliance School. He learned the [[Turkish language]] in addition to [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and initially worked in a public debt department,&lt;ref name="Matthews267"/&gt; heading the city's trade office in 1913.&lt;ref name="Yazbak"/&gt;

==Leadership in Haifa and career in commerce==
Al-Haj Ibrahim would later occupy a post as an official on the Haifa zone of the [[Hejaz Railway]].&lt;ref name="Matthews267"&gt;Matthews, 2006, p.267.&lt;/ref&gt; He gradually became the head of his entire family and gained considerable influence in the city; a common phrase that evolved in the area was "One cannot talk of Haifa without mentioning Rashid's name."&lt;ref name="Yazbak"&gt;Yazbak, 1997, pp.149-150.&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[World War I]], when the [[United Kingdom|British]] occupied  and took control of Palestine from the Ottomans and established the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate]] in 1922, al-Haj Ibrahim worked both in commerce and journalism in Haifa. He led the city's Islamic Society, a charitable organization, in 1927, and the local Young Men's Muslim Association (YMMA).&lt;ref name="Matthews52"&gt;Matthews, 2006, p.52 and p.58.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to compete with [[Histadrut|Local labor parties]], by August 1928, al-Haj Ibrahim was in charge of registering Arab laborers and tradesmen to work for employers in government-run building projects, particularly the port expansion scheme in Haifa.&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, 2006, p.59.&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 23, 1930, [[Arab nationalism|Arab nationalist]] organizations met in [[Nablus]]—which was holding a general strike protesting a pro-[[Zionism|Zionist]] British policy in Palestine—and elected a committee to help arm the Arab villages against the British occupying army and its atrocities. Al-Haj Ibrahim was tasked to collect funds to purchase weapons.&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, 2006, p.94.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Grand Mufti of Jerusalem]] and head of the [[Supreme Muslim Council]], [[Haj Amin al-Husseini]], requested that al-Haj Ibrahim help Arab youth groups to pray and guard the Al Aqsa Mosque and to secure the site from the Jewish gangs attacks{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}, but al-Haj Ibrahim preferred to focus on condemning the British Mandate decision to draft [[Zionist]] youth into the army. In 1931, he established the Haifa branch of the [[Arab Bank]].&lt;ref name="Matthews267"/&gt; The salary he earned from managing the bank was supplemented slightly by the income generated from agricultural land he owned west of the city.&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, 2006, p.151.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Independence Party of Palestine==
[[File:Istiqlal.jpg|thumb|right|Leading members of the Istiqlal (Independence) Party, 1932. Al-Haj Ibrahim is seated second from left, to the right of [[Izzat Darwaza]]]]

He joined the [[Independence Party (Palestine)|Istiqlal (Independence) Party]]—which promoted Arab nationalism and had counterparts in [[Syria]] and [[Iraq]]—along with [[Izzat Darwaza]] and [[Awni Abd al-Hadi]] when it was founded in 1932.&lt;ref name="PASSIA"&gt;[http://www.passia.org/palestine_facts/personalities/alpha_h.htm Palestinian personalities - H] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990128121613/http://www.passia.org/palestine_facts/personalities/alpha_h.htm |date=1999-01-28 }}. [[Palestinian Academic Society for the Study of International Affairs]]. (PASSIA).&lt;/ref&gt; The party held a congress in [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] in 1932 which al-Haj Ibrahim presided over. He was designated the leader of the party's branch in Haifa.&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, 2006, p.153.&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1932, he resigned from his position in the Haifa Islamic Society. According to the ''[[Filastin (newspaper)|Filastin]]'' newspaper, he did so in protest of the sacking of Sheikh Kamil al-Qassab as the society's director of schools. It was also speculated al-Haj Ibrahim quit because of the society's dominance by al-Husayni who was reportedly aiming to undermine the al-Istiqlal party because of its rising popularity. However, he remained intensely involved in Haifa's YMMA whose leadership was intertwined with that of the Islamic Society.&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, 2006, p.155.&lt;/ref&gt; Under his leadership, Haifa became an al-Istiqlal stronghold.&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, 2006, p.211.&lt;/ref&gt; In line with the party's policy to expand the Arabic values, al-Haj Ibrahim became one of many investors to form an Arabic film company that would open cinemas in [[Jerusalem]], [[Jaffa]], Haifa, and [[Amman]] in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, 2006, p.148.&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in the late 1920s, al-Haj Ibrahim became the closest political associate of [[Sheikh Izz ad-Din al-Qassam]],&lt;ref&gt;Schleifer, ed. Burke, p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; a religious leader from [[Syria]] who led an uprising activities against the occupying British military and Jewish gangs in Palestine. Because al-Qassam was frequently detained and tortured by the British authorities, al-Haj Ibrahim appealed to him several times to maintain his position; he would frequently negotiate with the British authorities To release al-Qassam.&lt;ref&gt;Schleifer, ed. Burke, 2005, p.149.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1935, al-Qassam was killed by the occupying British forces in an assault near [[Jenin]], an action that would provoke the [[1936–39 Arab uprising in Palestine]] in which al-Haj Ibrahim was a chief activist.&lt;ref name="PASSIA"/&gt;

Due to his role in the uprising, he was exiled to the [[Seychelles]] in 1936.&lt;ref name="Matthews267"/&gt; Following a conference in [[London]] in 1939, al-Haj Ibrahim was among the Palestinian notables invited by [[Muhammad Mahmoud Pasha]], the [[Prime Minister of Egypt]], to discuss and modify the British [[White Paper of 1939|White Paper]]—which called for a united Palestine led by both Palestinian Arabs and Jews in proportion to their population ratio.&lt;ref name="PASSIA"/&gt; Al-Haj Ibrahim returned to Palestine in February 1940.&lt;ref&gt;Khalaf, 1991, p.80.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to further their political influence, the Istiqlalists with al-Haj Ibrahim as their leader, negotiated with [[Abdullah I of Jordan]] to gain the support of his partisans in Palestine as a counterweight to al-Husayni's supporters.&lt;ref&gt;Gelber, 1997, p.180.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in Palestine war==
[[1947-1948 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine|Hostilities]] between Jews and Arabs in Palestine erupted as the British withdrew in mid-1947. In Haifa, a 14-member National Committee (NC) was established on December 2, with al-Haj Ibrahim as its chairman. He led the committee until its disestablishment in April 1948 during the thick of the war. He wrote to al-Husayni the "Arab world faces destruction [because]... the Jews want to take over [ [[Egypt]], Syria, [[Lebanon]], [[Emirate of Transjordan|Transjordan]], [[Iraq]], and the [[Hejaz]] ]." According to [[Israel]]i historian [[Benny Morris]], he believed that the Jews would establish a "giant" navy and air force and built atomic weapons with which to spread fear among the Arab people. Nonetheless, from the beginning of hostilities in December 1947, al-Haj Ibrahim encouraged moderation and pursued a ceasefire between the Arab and Jewish paramilitary forces,&lt;ref&gt;Morris, 2004, p.100.&lt;/ref&gt; declaring the "Arabs were interested in quiet in Haifa..."&lt;ref&gt;Morris, 2004, p.102.&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposition with al-Husayni's policies in the city mounted with al-Haj Ibrahim threatening to leave the city along with all of its senior politicians if al-Husayni continued to order attacks against Jewish forces there.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, 2004, p.103.&lt;/ref&gt; Many senior politicians, including 11 out of the 15 NC members, had already left the city despite persuasion by al-Haj Ibrahim to remain in the city and help the Arab inhabitants face Jewish irregulars. Nonetheless, he left Palestine himself in early April 1948.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, 2004, p.109.&lt;/ref&gt; He did so apparently after quarreling with the [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] [[Druze]] commander of the [[Arab Liberation Army]] (ALA) in Haifa, Amin Izz al-Din Nabahani.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, 2004, p.187.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life and death==
Al-Haj Ibrahim moved to Amman, [[Jordan]] after fleeing Haifa upon its capture by Jewish forces. He wrote memoirs of his experience in Palestine from 1947 to the early 1950s. They mostly outlined the responsibility of the Palestinian leadership regarding the circumstances of the city's fall, and exposing its performance and political discourse during the British Mandate period.&lt;ref name="IPS"&gt;[http://www.palestine-studies.org/books.aspx?href=details&amp;id=584&amp;lang=A Summary of Defending Haifa and the Problem of Palestine]. [[Institute of Palestine Studies]].&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Haj Ibrahim died in Amman in 1953, and was buried in [[Damascus]], Syria.&lt;ref name="PASSIA"/&gt; Palestinian historian [[Walid Khalidi]] edited and published his memoirs, titled ''Defending Haifa and the Problem of Palestine: The Memoirs of Rashid al-Haj Ibrahim, 1891-1953'',&lt;ref name="IPS"/&gt; in the [[Institute for Palestine Studies]], [[Beirut]], in 2006.&lt;ref name="PASSIA"/&gt;

Irani was brought to Occidental in 1983 to help its struggling chemicals division, and soon was promoted to president, replacing a series of presidents fired by Hammer.&lt;ref&gt;John Evan Frook, [http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-9111635.html New heir apparent at Occidental doesn't pacify unhappy shareholders, analysts say], Los Angeles Business Journal, February 4, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1988, the media reported that Irani and his team were running the day-to-day operations of the company on behalf of the then 90-year-old Hammer.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Ramirez, "Hammer Hits 90! Oxy Grows Up Too," ''Fortune'', November 7, 1988, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 Irani was awarded options worth $392 million.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Irani made news in 2007, when it was revealed that his total compensation for the 2006 year topped $450 million. His base salary was $1.3 million.  Occidental justified the compensation by pointing to the stock price, which had risen from $9 a share when Irani succeeded Hammer to $48.60 at the end of 2006, and to the company's market capitalization, which grew from $32.1 billion at the end of 2005 to $42.5 billion at the end of 2006.&lt;ref name="LAT040707"/&gt; His compensation in 2009 totaled $31.4 million, including $1,170,000 in salary and $24,758,827 in stock.  According to the Associated Press, within the last decade, Irani has received $857 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/deals/2010/08/03/is-occidentals-irani-worth-his-big-pay-check/ | accessdate = 2011-10-04 | work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Michael | last=Corkery | title=Is Occidental's Irani Worth His Big Pay Check? | date=August 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Irani put funds into an overseas tax shelter arranged by Deutsche Bank AG that the IRS later deemed an illegal [[tax avoidance]] scheme.  The Occidental Chairman opposed the U.S. Department of Justice subpoena of Deutsche Bank AG records as part of an investigation of myCFO Inc. His appeal was rejected by the U.S. Court of Appeals in 2006.  Occidental's Board of Directors took no action against Irani despite the IRS ruling. An Occidental spokesman said that Irani's participation in the tax avoidance scheme was a personal matter and was not a violation of the company's code of conduct policy.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Waldman [https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aQgudxxo2XFQ Ray Irani Making $59 Millions As Americans Deplore Executive Pay March 25, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

Irani was awarded a $900,000 cash bonus by the Occidental board of directors for exceptional performance in implementing a cost-cutting initiative (including reduction in force job terminations) in anticipation of a "world-wide economic deterioration."  This was awarded on a discretionary basis by the Occidental compensation committee and not by any company performance metrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.thecorporatelibrary.com |title=The Corporate Library |website=thecorporatelibrary.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110917020547/http://thecorporatelibrary.com/ |archivedate=2011-09-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chazen collected $38,080,344 and Irani $76,107,010 in fiscal year 2010, nearly doubling his 2009 compensation despite shareholder outrage over the Occidental board of directors executive pay policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://newsandinsight.thomsonreuters.com/Legal/News/ViewNews.aspx?id=22515|title=Woman tops list of highest-paid general counsels |accessdate=2011-09-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401070457/http://newsandinsight.thomsonreuters.com/Legal/News/ViewNews.aspx?id=22515 |archivedate=2012-04-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://investing.businessweek.com/businessweek/research/stocks/people/person.asp?personId=293288&amp;ticker= Executive Profile September 08, 2011 {{Dead link|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Irani retired as CEO on May 10, 2011 after the California State Teachers' Retirement System and Relational Investors, two major institutional Occidental Investors, objected to the company's compensation policies and announced plans to replace long-term board members who were described as "ossified" in a letter written in protest of Irani's salary.  They also termed Irani's salary a "corporate giveaway program."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/tag/relational-investors/|title=Relational Investors - DealBook - The New York Times|publisher= dealbook.nytimes.com |accessdate=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Irani's salary was considered excessive and not truly performance based for decades by a number of corporate governance authorities who noted that Irani's compensation had exceeded that of the head of energy giant ExxonMobil, Rex Tillerson, who leads a company that has a market cap that is five times larger than Occidental Petroleum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/aug/03/business/la-fi-oxy-calstrs-20100803|title=CalSTRS seeks to unseat 4 Oxy directors over executive pay|first=Marc|last=Lifsher|date=3 August 2010|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==KB Home backdating scandal==
Irani was a [[KB Home]] director for 15 years until November 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/nov/03/business/fi-briefs3.s4|title=Occidental's Irani leaves KB board|first1=From Times|last1=Staff|first2=Wire|last2=Reports|date=3 November 2007|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Irani chaired the KB Home executive compensation committee during the time period when CEO [[Bruce Karatz]] lied about the company's practice of backdating options.  Karatz was subsequently indicted and convicted April 21, 2010 on Federal charges stemming from his actions and sanctioned by the SEC in a separate civil action.  The KB Home shareholders expressed their lack of confidence in the board and the compensation committee by a 19% opposition vote against Irani, who resigned from the KB Home board of directors after 15 years of service.  Occidental offered no explanation for his resignation in their proxy statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/hotproperty/archives/2009/03/former_kb_home_chief_indicted.html |archive-date= September 15, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110915171415/http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/hotproperty/archives/2009/03/former_kb_home_chief_indicted.html|title=Former KB Home Chief Indicted| date=April 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.plansponsor.com/NewsStory.aspx?id=6442451733 |title=CalPERS to Withhold Director Votes on Backdating Concerns |accessdate=2011-10-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405081216/http://www.plansponsor.com/NewsStory.aspx?id=6442451733 |archive-date=2012-04-05 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.plansponsor.com/NewsStory.aspx?Id=6442451659 |title=KB Home Taps Independent Chairman in Post-Options Scandal Era |accessdate=2011-10-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405081224/http://www.plansponsor.com/NewsStory.aspx?Id=6442451659 |archive-date=2012-04-05 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Rig'n'Roll''''', acronymed '''''RnR''''' or '''''R&amp;R''''', is a [[Open world|sandbox]]-style [[truck]] [[vehicle simulation game|driving simulation]] and [[racing video game]] released on 27 November 2009 in Russia and during 2010 in the rest of the world.&lt;ref name="Release1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tothegame.com/pc-7617-rig-n-roll-for-pc.html|title=Official Fact Sheet|publisher=''ToTheGame''|accessdate=2010-07-07|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100626065542/http://www.tothegame.com/pc-7617-rig-n-roll-for-pc.html|archivedate=2010-06-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} It simulates [[Road transport|truck driving]] and [[management]] along with associated business [[strategy game#Simulation|strategic]] activities, and features some of the best known trucks in North America (list below). The game takes place in [[California]] and [[Nevada]], in the year 2014.

The game was published by [[1C Company|1C]] and developed by [[SoftLab-NSK]]'s Igor Belago, who was inspired by games like [[Grand Theft Auto]].&lt;ref name="Interview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.playhard.ru/Article.aspx?id=3814|title=Interview with Igor Belago, SoftLab-NSK|publisher=''PlayHard.ru''|date=2009-11-26|accessdate=2010-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Rig'n'Roll'' also includes a program for the creation of [[skin (computing)|skins]] for trucks, [[license plate]]s, and [[Trailer (vehicle)|trailers]]. Gameplay modes include [[racing]], single-player [[Objective (goal)|missions]], regular truck driving, and free cruising.

This game is also called ''Hard Truck 3: Rig'N'Roll'' but the name ''Hard Truck'' was removed after the prequel ''[[Hard Truck 2: King of the Road]]''.

Unlike most sandbox games, ignoring a story mission for too long will end the game abruptly.

After completing the story missions, Nick can focus on expanding his trucking company, with his goal being to win the award for having the most successful company at a certain in-game date. If he succeeds, he receives a large cash reward. Failure to do so results in a "Game Over" screen although the player can continue playing the game with no penalties.

==Gameplay==
Rig'n'Roll offers a lot of road exploration based on real-life locations, with multiple missions to be completed and places to visit in non-linear environments. Management in this game is done by using [[slider (computing)|sliders]], and much of the game is focused around cargo/truck selection and choosing routes. To start missions, the player drives into a warehouse and chooses either a normal delivery to another warehouse (which can be a solo delivery or a competition against [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] opponents; the highest payment goes to whoever reaches the destination first) or a race with other truck drivers. Every delivery has a time limit, and the payment will be deducted if the player's truck hits anything while delivering fragile goods. While on the roads, players can interact with [[Non-player character|NPCs]] (e.g. hitchhikers) and take on sidequests.

For the management part of the game, the player is able to hire or fire drivers, adjust driver AI behavior for both trucks and cargoes, upgrade their fleet of trucks, view rankings list, improve truck rating statistics, manage and expand their business economy at freight management offices, warehouses, and via a [[Personal Digital Assistant|PDA]] device known as ''"Black Shark"''.&lt;ref name="Gameplay"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guides.gamepressure.com/rignroll|title=Rig'n'Roll Game Guide|publisher=''GamePressure''|date=2010-07-06|accessdate=2010-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each driver has his or her own preferences for options such as choosing to make long or short distance deliveries, whether they should deliver fragile goods and how often they should participate in races. Changing the AI behavior may increase the amount of money the driver earns for the company per day but it may sometimes cause his or her loyalty to drop.

Although there are no speed limits on any of the in-game roads, there is a heavy emphasis on following traffic laws while driving. In addition to hitting other vehicles, the player can be pulled over and fined by the police for offences like driving at night with the headlights off, driving in the wrong direction and not giving [[Traffic#Priority .28right of way.29|right of way]]. Committing an offence will usually trigger a pursuit by a police car even if there are none around at the time when the offence took place.

==Development==
This game was in development for over 9 years due to the developer of the game focusing mainly on making hardware/software equipment for multimedia, TV broadcasting, VR systems, imaging systems for training simulators, and video game [[Game engine|engines]] for computer games.{{Unreliable source?|date=June 2015}}

Before release, it was also featured at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]] 2005, [[Gamescom]], as well as several other Russian gaming exhibitions and developer conferences. A demo was announced for 2009 and then for 2010, but both scheduled dates were canceled. All cheats were taken out of the game prior to release. Also, modding possibilities, trainer usage, save file hex-editing and hacking of the game were somewhat restricted.

Rig 'n' Roll supports [[AMD Eyefinity]]-based [[multi-monitor]] set-ups.
Nokia alone

==Reception==
Rig'n'Roll has so far received mostly fair to positive (mixed) reviews on the [[Metacritic]]/[[GameRankings]]&lt;ref name="Reviews1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/pc/rignroll|title=Rig'n'Roll (pc) reviews at Metacritic.com|publisher=''[[Metacritic]]''|accessdate=2010-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reviews2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerankings.com/pc/915042-rignroll/|title=Rig'n'Roll for PC|publisher=''[[GameRankings]]''|accessdate=2010-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; sites respectively, praising the game for its realistic graphics in depicting the Californian scenery, impressive physics, truck designs, music soundtrack, intuitive controls, mission structure, and gameplay variety. The game was also criticized because of its truck-driving simulation aspects feeling too "arcadey", for having a weak in-game tutorial, a lack of [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]], and for frequent delays in development.

==Versions==
Voice acting for Rig'n'Roll was done in English, except for the Russian version. The list below (in brackets) only tells what language the subtitles, text, and menus will be displayed in.

===Patches===
[[Patch (computing)|Patches]] to improve system performance and optimization were released for Russian version of game. All other versions have these patches included already (hotfixes must be applied manually). The latest patch for Rig'n'Roll Russian version is currently ''3.0.5''. English US retail is ''3.0.4'', while the English version [[hotfix]] for some downloaded versions is ''3.0.1''. So any boxed retail version that is newer than the Russian version will have a version number that is greater than the previous release of the game and the latest patch. This can be confirmed while at the main menu, or by looking at the file version properties of the game's executable.

Newer patches to fix additional bugs are reported to only be included in the upcoming expansions, so players would have to buy the expansion first to get the patch. However, as for today, no more patches were released, and game has been probably abandoned by developer.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

===Expansion===
SoftLab-Nsk had plans to expand the game map to [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], according to advertisement banners that were put up along the roads and highways of California. Content included in this [[expansion pack|expansion]] was rumored to contain a patch for the game to fix certain [[glitch|bugs]], as well as to add a few more trucks, hitchhiker/storyline missions, and gameplay features such as pedestrians that were either missing or deactivated in the original game. The expansion pack along with the patch were planned to be released at the same time as a free download, but rumors have been reported that they were planned to be actually released at a cost - either through an online digital download service provider or at a retail game store. More information on the expansion and a possible release date is not disclosed, and addon itself is rumored to be permanently cancelled by developer or publisher.&lt;ref name="Expansion"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rignroll.com/p-273.html|title=Press|publisher=''Igor Belago''|date=2010-02-17|accessdate=2010-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Add-ons==
Not many addons were released for Rig'n'Roll.&lt;ref name="Add-ons"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://online.1c.ru/games/game/5661754/|title=1C Russian Online Store|publisher=''[[1C]]''|accessdate=2010-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; One addon was however released, and second one is yet unknown. They include airbursh kits and more gameplay content to supplement the game's Sandbox-style driving open world. The biggest addon is ''The Great Race'' — a total file size of 578.85[[megabyte|МB]]. Las Vegas addon release date is unknown, but there is a rumor that it has been cancelled by developer or publisher.

===The Great Race===
The very first major Black Shark [[downloadable content|add-on]] modification for Rig'n'Roll: '''The Great Race''',&lt;ref name="GR1C"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://online.1c.ru/games/game/10533373/|title=Rig'n'Roll: The Great Race|publisher=''[[1C]]''|date=2010-11-12|accessdate=2010-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GRTruckPol"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://truckpol.republika.pl/|title=Rig'n'Roll Add-on Big Races|publisher=''TruckPol''|date=2010-11-08|accessdate=2010-11-11|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821084327/http://truckpol.republika.pl/|archivedate=2010-08-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; according to 1CPublishing, is expected to be released on December 2010 in time for the Christmas holidays, or Q1 2011 for all English version copies of the game as [[downloadable content|DLC]]. The Russian version for TGR is scheduled for release on November 12, 2010. This addon will feature more of CCWA's Big Rigs championship event called the "Monster Cup", which focuses more on allowing players to compete in several arcade-style truck races with selectable map tracks, rather than just in the usual ''pick, choose &amp; deliver'' truck tycoon management RPG-style gameplay approach. 8

===Monster Cup===
The Monster Cup focuses on arcade racing across all of California and a bit of Nevada. Its races are long distance and go anywhere from 10 minutes to 40 minutes. It has eight leagues:

1 - 5th League

2nd - 4th League

3rd - 3rd League

4th - 2nd League

5th - 1st League

6th - Premier League

7th - Championship League

8th - Monster League

===Airbrush kits===
[[Airbrush]] kits to wipe or paint the color and dye of your truck to your preference. It is available in the game's repair truckstop as a way of creating [[skin (computing)|skins]].

'''Root cause analysis''' ('''RCA''') is a method of [[problem solving]] used for identifying the [[root cause]]s of faults or problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=Paul F.|last2=Dell|first2=Larry D.|last3=Anderson|first3=Gaylord F.|title=Root Cause Analysis: A Tool for Total Quality Management|date=1993|publisher=ASQ Quality Press|location=Milwaukee, Wisconsin|isbn=0-87389-163-5|pages=8–17|ref=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A factor is considered a root cause if removal thereof from the problem-fault-sequence prevents the final undesirable outcome from recurring; whereas a causal factor is one that affects an event's outcome, but is not a root cause.  Though removing a causal factor can benefit an outcome, it does not prevent its recurrence with certainty.

Essentially it is based on four general principles,&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; extended throughout this article:

* Define and describe properly the event or problem ([[5 Whys|'five whys' technique]]).
* Establish a timeline from normal situation until the final crisis or failure.
* Distinguish between root causes and causal factor.
* Once implemented (and with constant execution), RCA is transformed into a method of problem prediction.

== Uses ==
RCA is applied to methodically identify and correct the root causes of events, rather than to simply address the symptomatic result.  Focusing correction on root causes has the goal of entirely preventing problem recurrence.  Conversely, RCFA (Root Cause Failure Analysis) recognizes that complete prevention of recurrence by one corrective action is not always possible.

RCA is typically used as a reactive method of identifying event(s) causes, revealing problems and solving them. Analysis is done ''after'' an event has occurred. Insights in RCA make it potentially useful as a preemptive method. In that event, RCA can be used to ''forecast'' or predict probable events even ''before'' they occur. While one follows the other, RCA is a completely separate process to [[incident management]].

== Examples ==
For example, imagine a fictional segment of students who received poor testing scores. After initial investigation, it was verified that students taking tests in the final period of the school day got lower scores. Further investigation revealed that late in the day, the students lacked ability to focus. Even further investigation revealed that the reason for the lack of focus was hunger. So, the root cause of the poor testing scores was hunger, remedied by moving the testing time to soon after lunch.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

As another example, imagine an investigation into a machine that stopped because it overloaded and the fuse blew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Taiichi Ohno|title=Toyota Production System: Beyond Large-Scale Production|page=17|year=1988|location=Portland, Oregon|publisher=Productivity Press|ISBN=0-915299-14-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Investigation shows that the machine overloaded because it had a bearing that wasn't being sufficiently lubricated. The investigation proceeds further and finds that the  automatic lubrication mechanism had a pump which was not pumping sufficiently, hence the lack of lubrication. Investigation of the pump shows that it has a worn shaft. Investigation of why the shaft was worn discovers that there isn't an adequate mechanism to prevent metal scrap getting into the pump. This enabled scrap to get into the pump, and damage it. The root cause of the problem is therefore that metal scrap can contaminate the lubrication system. Fixing this problem ought to prevent the whole sequence of events recurring. Compare this with an investigation that does not find the root cause: replacing the fuse, the bearing, or the lubrication pump will probably allow the machine to go back into operation for a while. But there is a risk that the problem will simply recur, until the root cause is dealt with.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

Note that "root causes" are likely to have many levels, and the analysis terminates at a level that is "root" only to the eyes of the current investigator.  Looking at the second example, a deeper level root cause is that the maintenance procedures at the plant included periodic inspection of the lubrication subsystem every two years, while the current lubrication subsystem vendor's product specified a 6-month period.  Switching vendors may have been due to management's desire to save money, and a failure to consult with cognizant engineering staff on the implication of the change, and so on.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

Thus, while the "root cause" shown above may have prevented the quoted recurrence, it would not have prevented other{{snd}} perhaps more severe{{snd}} future failures.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

Quite often, "engineering-type" root cause analysis stops at the engineering level, and fails to go down to deeper, organizational roots.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

Root cause analysis is used in [[ITIL]], a set of detailed practices for [[IT service management]], where the analysis is performed to resolve a recurring incident by the problem manager. Within [[computer security incident management]], root cause analysis may be called security investigation and analysis.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

== Classification ==
Rather than one sharply defined methodology, RCA comprises many different tools, processes, and philosophies. However, several very-broadly defined approaches or "schools" can be identified by their basic approach or field of origin: safety-based, production-based, assembly-based, process-based, failure-based, and systems-based.

* Safety-based RCA arose from the fields of [[Accident Analysis|accident analysis]] and [[occupational safety and health]].
* Production-based RCA has roots in the field of [[quality control]] for industrial [[manufacturing]].
* Process-based RCA, a follow-on to production-based RCA, broadens the scope of RCA to include [[business process]]es.
* Failure-based RCA originates in the practice of [[failure analysis]] as employed in [[engineering]] and [[Maintenance, Repair and Operations|maintenance]].
* Systems-based RCA has emerged as an amalgam of the preceding schools, incorporating elements from other fields such as [[change management]], [[risk management]] and [[systems analysis]].

Despite the different approaches among the various schools of root cause analysis, all share some common principles. Several general processes for performing RCA can also be defined.

==General principles==
# The primary aim of root cause analysis is: to identify the factors that resulted in the nature, the magnitude, the location, and the timing of the harmful outcomes (consequences) of one or more past events; to determine what behaviors, actions, inactions, or conditions need to be changed; to prevent recurrence of similar harmful outcomes; and to identify lessons that may promote the achievement of better consequences. ("Success" is defined as the near-certain prevention of recurrence).
# To be effective, root cause analysis must be performed systematically, usually as part of an investigation, with conclusions and root causes that are identified backed up by documented evidence. A team effort is typically required.
# There may be more than one root cause for an event or a problem, therefore the difficult part is demonstrating the persistence and sustaining the effort required to determine them.
# The purpose of identifying all solutions to a problem is to prevent recurrence at lowest cost in the simplest way. If there are alternatives that are equally effective, then the simplest or lowest cost approach is preferred.
# The root causes identified will depend on the way in which the problem or event is defined. Effective problem statements and event descriptions (as failures, for example) are helpful and usually required to ensure the execution of appropriate analyses.
# One logical way to trace down root causes is by utilizing [[hierarchical clustering]] [[data mining|data-mining]] solutions (such as [[graph theory|graph-theory-based]] data mining). A root cause is defined in that context as "the conditions that enable one or more causes". Root causes can be deductively sorted out from upper groups of which the groups include a specific cause.
# To be effective, the analysis should establish a [[sequence of events]] or [[timeline]] for understanding the relationships between contributory (causal) factors, root cause(s) and the defined problem or event to be prevented.
# Root cause analysis can help transform a reactive culture (one that reacts to problems) into a forward-looking culture (one that solves problems before they occur or escalate). More importantly, RCA reduces the frequency of problems occurring over time within the environment where the process is used.
# Root cause analysis as a force for change is a threat to many cultures and environments. Threats to cultures are often met with resistance. Other forms of management support may be required to achieve effectiveness and success with root cause analysis. For example, a "non-punitive" policy toward problem identifiers may be required.

==General process for performing and documenting an RCA-based corrective action==
RCA (in steps 3, 4 and 5) forms the most critical part of successful corrective action, directing the corrective action at the true root cause of the problem. Knowing the root cause is secondary to the goal of prevention, as it is not possible to determine an absolutely effective corrective action for the defined problem without knowing the root cause.

# Define the problem or describe the event to prevent in the future. Include the qualitative and quantitative attributes (properties) of the undesirable outcomes. Usually this includes specifying the natures, the magnitudes, the locations, and the timing of events. In some cases, "lowering the risks of reoccurrences" may be a reasonable target. For example, "lowering the risks" of future automobile accidents is certainly a more economically attainable goal than "preventing all" future automobile accidents.
# Gather data and evidence, classifying it along a timeline of events to the final failure or crisis. For every behavior, condition, action and inaction, specify in the "timeline" what should have been done when it differs from what was done.
# In data mining Hierarchical Clustering models, use the clustering groups instead of classifying: (a) peak the groups that exhibit the specific cause; (b) find their upper-groups; (c) find group characteristics that are consistent; (d) check with experts and validate.
# Ask "why" and identify the causes associated with each sequential step towards the defined problem or event. "Why" is taken to mean "What were the factors that directly resulted in the effect?"
# Classify causes into two categories: causal factors that relate to an event in the sequence; and root causes that interrupted that step of the sequence chain when eliminated.
# Identify all other harmful factors that have equal or better claim to be called "root causes". If there are multiple root causes, which is often the case, reveal those clearly for later optimum selection.
# Identify corrective action(s) that will, with certainty, prevent recurrence of each harmful effect and related outcomes or factors. Check that each corrective action would, if pre-implemented before the event, have reduced or prevented specific harmful effects.
# Identify solutions that, when effective and with consensus agreement of the group: prevent recurrence with reasonable certainty; are within the institution's control; meet its goals and objectives; and do not cause or introduce other new, unforeseen problems.
# Implement the recommended root cause correction(s).
# Ensure effectiveness by observing the implemented solutions in operation.
# Identify other possibly useful methodologies for problem solving and problem avoidance.
# Identify and address the other instances of each harmful outcome and harmful factor.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1043">'''Sectoral collective bargaining''' is an aim of [[trade unions]] or [[labor unions]] to reach a [[collective agreement]] that covers all workers in a sector of the economy. It contrasts to [[enterprise bargaining]] where agreements cover individual firms. Generally countries with sectoral collective bargaining have higher rates of union organisation and better coverage of collective agreements than countries with enterprise bargaining.

==United Kingdom==
While sectoral bargaining used to be standard in the UK, enterprise bargaining was advocated by the ''[[Royal Commission on Trade Unions and Employers' Associations]]'' chaired by [[Lord Donovan]].

==United States==
Sectoral bargaining was promoted by the [[National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933]], but struck down and replaced by enterprise bargaining under the [[National Labor Relations Act of 1935]].

'''''The Corporation''''' is a 2003 Canadian [[documentary film]] written by [[University of British Columbia]] law professor [[Joel Bakan]], and directed by [[Mark Achbar]] and [[Jennifer Abbott]]. The documentary examines the modern-day [[corporation]]. Bakan wrote the book, ''The Corporation: The Pathological Pursuit of Profit and Power'', during the filming of the documentary.

==Synopsis==
The documentary shows the development of the contemporary business corporation, from a [[Legal person|legal entity]] that originated as a government-chartered institution meant to affect specific public functions to the rise of the modern commercial institution entitled to most of the legal rights of a person. The documentary concentrates mostly upon [[North American]] corporations, especially those in the United States. One theme is its assessment of corporations as persons, as a result of [[Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad|an 1886 case]] in the [[United States Supreme Court]] in which a statement by [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[Morrison R. Waite]]&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;"The court does not wish to hear argument on the question whether the provision in the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]], which forbids a State to deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws, applies to these corporations. We are all of the opinion that it does." However, the Supreme Court decision did not itself address the matter of whether corporations were "persons" with respect to the Fourteenth Amendment; in [[Chief Justice Waite]]'s words, "we avoided meeting the question". (118 U.S. 394 (1886) - According to the official court Syllabus in the [[United States Reports]])&lt;/ref&gt; led to corporations as "persons" having the same rights as human beings, based on the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution]].
 
Topics addressed include the [[Business Plot]], where in 1933, General [[Smedley Butler]] exposed an alleged corporate plot against then U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]; the [[tragedy of the commons]]; [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]'s warning people to beware of the rising [[military-industrial complex]]; economic [[externality|externalities]]; suppression of an investigative news story about [[Bovine Growth Hormone]] on  [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] affiliate television station [[WTVT]] in [[Tampa, Florida]] at the behest of [[Monsanto]]; the invention of the [[soft drink]] [[Fanta]] by [[The Coca-Cola Company]] due to the trade embargo on [[Nazi Germany]]; the alleged role of [[IBM]] in the [[The Holocaust|Nazi holocaust]] (see [[IBM and the Holocaust]]); the [[Cochabamba Water War|Cochabamba protests of 2000]] brought on by the [[privatization]] of a municipal [[water supply]] in [[Bolivia]]; and in general themes of [[corporate social responsibility]], the notion of [[limited liability]], the corporation as a psychopath, and the [[corporate personhood debate]].

Through vignettes and interviews, ''The Corporation'' examines and criticizes corporate business practices. The film's assessment is affected via the diagnostic criteria in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|''DSM-IV'']]; [[Robert D. Hare]], a [[University of British Columbia]] psychology professor and a consultant to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], compares the profile of the contemporary profitable business corporation to that of a clinically diagnosed [[Psychopathy|psychopath]] (however, Hare has objected to the manner in which his views are portrayed in the film; see "[[#Critical reception|Critical reception]]" below).  ''The Corporation'' attempts to compare the way corporations are systematically compelled to behave with what it claims are the ''DSM-IV''{{'}}s symptoms of [[psychopathy]], e.g., the callous disregard for the feelings of other people, the incapacity to maintain human relationships, the reckless disregard for the safety of others, the deceitfulness (continual lying to deceive for [[Profit (economics)|profit]]), the incapacity to experience [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], and the failure to conform to [[Norm (sociology)|social norms]] and respect the [[law]].

===Interviews===
The film features interviews with prominent corporate critics such as [[Noam Chomsky]], [[Charles Kernaghan]], [[Naomi Klein]], [[Michael Moore]], [[Vandana Shiva]], and [[Howard Zinn]], as well as opinions from company [[CEO]]s such as [[Ray Anderson (entrepreneur)|Ray Anderson]] (from the [[Interface, Inc|Interface]] carpet and fabric company), and viewpoints from business gurus [[Peter Drucker]] and [[Milton Friedman]], and [[think tank]]s advocating free markets such as the [[Fraser Institute]]. Interviews also feature Dr. [[Samuel Epstein]], who was involved in a lawsuit against [[Monsanto Company]] for promoting the use of [[Posilac]], (Monsanto's [[trade name]] for recombinant [[Bovine Somatotropin]]) to induce more milk production in [[dairy cattle]] and [[Chris Barrett]] who, as a spokesperson for [[First USA]], was the first corporately sponsored college student in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/19/nyregion/and-now-a-word-from-their-cool-college-sponsor.html|title= And Now a Word From Their Cool College Sponsor|publisher=www.nytimes.com |date= July 19, 2001 |accessdate=2017-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
===Box office===
''The Corporation'' grossed around $3.5 million in American box office receipts and had a worldwide gross of over $4.8 million,&lt;ref name="numbers" /&gt; making it the second top-grossing film for [[Zeitgeist Films]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://boxofficemojo.com/studio/chart/?studio=zeitgeist.htm |website=Box Office Mojo|title= Zeitgeist Studios}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Versions===

====TVO version====
The extended edition made for [[TVOntario]] (TVO) separates the documentary into three 1-hour episodes:
*"'''Pathology of Commerce'''": About the pathological self-interest of the modern corporation.
*"'''Planet Inc.'''": About the scope of commerce and the sophisticated, even covert, techniques marketers use to get their brands into our homes.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
Film critics gave the film generally favorable reviews. The review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported that 90% of critics gave the film positive reviews, based on 111 reviews with an average rating of 7.4/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "''The Corporation'' is a satisfyingly dense, thought-provoking rebuttal to some of capitalism's central arguments."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/corporation/ |title = The Corporation (2004) |accessdate = March 13, 2018 |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |work= [[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metacritic]] reported the film had an average score of 73 out of 100, based on 28 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-corporation |title = The Corporation Reviews |accessdate = March 13, 2018 |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |work=[[Metacritic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' (October 1, 2003), Dennis Harvey praised the film's "surprisingly cogent, entertaining, even rabble-rousing indictment of perhaps the most influential institutional model for our era" and its avoidance of "a sense of excessively partisan rhetoric" by deploying a wide range of interviewees and "a bold organizational scheme that lets focus jump around in interconnective, humorous, hit-and-run fashion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117922025.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1 |title=The Corporation, review |author= Harvey, Dennis |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date= October 1, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' (July 16, 2004), [[Roger Ebert]] described the film as "an impassioned polemic, filled with information sure to break up any dinner-table conversation," but felt that "at 145 minutes, it overstays its welcome. The wise documentarian should treat film stock as a non-renewable commodity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20040716/REVIEWS/407160302/1023|title=The Corporation, review  |author=[[Roger Ebert|Ebert, Robert]] |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|date= July 16, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Economist]]'' review, while calling the film "a surprisingly rational and coherent attack on capitalism's most important institution" and "a thought-provoking account of the firm", calls it incomplete. It suggests that the idea for an organization as a [[psychopathic]] entity originated with [[Max Weber]], in regards to [[government]] [[bureaucracy]]. The reviewer remarks that the film weighs heavily in favor of [[public ownership]] as a solution to the evils depicted, while failing to acknowledge the magnitude of evils committed by governments in the name of [[public ownership]], such as those of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] in the former [[Soviet Union]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/business/displayStory.cfm?story_id=2647328 The lunatic you work for], review in ''[[The Economist]]'', May 6, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; or by [[Monarchies in Europe|monarchies]] and the [[Catholic Church|Church]].

An interview clip with psychiatrist [[Robert D. Hare]] appears for several minutes in ''The Corporation''. A pioneer in psychopathy research whose [[Hare Psychopathy Checklist]] is used in part to "diagnose" purportedly psychopathic behavior of corporations in the documentary, Hare has since objected to the manner in which his work was presented in the film and the use of his work to bolster what he describes as the film's questionable thesis and conclusions. In ''[[Snakes in Suits: When Psychopaths Go to Work]]'' (2007; co-written with Paul Babiak), Hare writes that despite claims by the filmmakers to him during production that they were using psychopathy [[metaphorically]] to describe "the most egregious" corporate misbehavior, the finished documentary obviously intends to imply that corporations in general or by definition are psychopathic, a claim that Hare emphatically rejects:
{{Quotation|To refer to ''the'' corporation as psychopathic because of the behaviors of a carefully selected group of companies is like using the traits and behaviors of the most serious high-risk criminals to conclude that ''the'' criminal (that is, all criminals) is a psychopath. If [common diagnostic criteria] ''were'' applied to a random set of corporations, some might apply for the diagnosis of psychopathy, but most would not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Babiak, Paul &amp; Hare, Robert D. |date=2007|title= Snakes in Suits: When Psychopaths Go to Work |publisher= HarperCollins|isbn= 0061147893|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8-_urXom4ykC&amp;lpg=PA95&amp;vq=the%20corporation&amp;pg=PA95#v=snippet&amp;q=the%20corporation&amp;f=false |page= 95}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
However, in his monologue in ''The Corporation'' and the transcript with added comments, Hare, in addition to pointing out differences between corporations, clearly uses generalized terms such as "tend", "most", "almost", "routinely", "much the same", "almost by their very nature", and "by definition" with regard to numerous of his characterizations of psychopathy applying to corporations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.thecorporation.com/index.cfm?page_id=314 | website= The Corporation | title= Transcripts and Extras | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130601232720/http://www.thecorporation.com/index.cfm?page_id=314 | archivedate= 2013-06-01 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, Hare insists that his guarded, qualified comments on the "academic exercise" of diagnosing certain corporations as psychopathic was used in support of a larger thesis that he was not informed in advance about and with which he did not agree.

==Awards==
The film was nominated for over 26 international awards &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecorporation.com/film/about-film About the film - The Corporation]&lt;/ref&gt; including the [[List of Sundance Film Festival award winners#2004|World Cinema Audience Award: Documentary]] at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] in 2004, a Special Jury Award at the [[International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam|International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam (IDFA)]] in 2003 and a [[Genie Award|Genie Award - Documentary]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0379225/awards?ref_=tt_ql_op_1|title=Awards IMdB|publisher=www.imdb.com |date= |accessdate=2017-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Diamond Smugglers''''' is a non-fiction work by [[Ian Fleming]] that was first published in 1957 in the United Kingdom and in 1958 in the United States. The book is based on two weeks of interviews Fleming undertook with John Collard, a member of the International Diamond Security Organisation (IDSO), which was headed by Sir [[Percy Sillitoe]], the ex-chief of [[MI5]] who worked exclusively for the diamond company [[De Beers]].

The IDSO was formed by Sillitoe to combat the smuggling of diamonds from Africa, where, it was estimated, £10 million (£{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|10000000|1957}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} pounds{{inflation-fn|UK|df=yes}}) worth of gems were being smuggled out of South Africa alone every year. The book expands upon articles Fleming wrote for ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' in 1957.

Fleming was better known as the author of a [[List of James Bond novels and short stories|series of books]] about his super-spy creation, [[James Bond (literary character)|James Bond]]; ''The Diamond Smugglers'' is one of two non-fiction books he wrote. It was broadly well-received, although some reviewers commented on the stories not being new.

==Synopsis==
''The Diamond Smugglers'' is the account of [[Ian Fleming]]'s meeting with John Collard, a member of the International Diamond Security Organisation (IDSO). The book takes the form of background narrative by Fleming of where the two men met, interspersed with the interview between Fleming and Collard, who is introduced under the pseudonym of "John Blaize".

Collard relates how he was recruited into the IDSO by Sir [[Percy Sillitoe]], the ex-head of [[MI5]], under whom Collard had worked. The book goes on to look at the activities of the IDSO from the end of 1954 until the operation was closed down in April 1957, when its job was complete. Collard explained that the IDSO was set up at the instigation of the Chairman of [[De Beers]], [[Philip Oppenheimer|Sir Philip Oppenheimer]], after an [[Interpol]] report stated that £10 million of diamonds were being smuggled out of South Africa each year, as well as additional amounts from [[Sierra Leone]], [[Portuguese Angola|Portuguese West Africa]], the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] and [[Tanganyika]].

As well as providing a history of the IDSO's operations, Collard relates a number of illustrative vignettes concerning the diamond smuggling cases he and the organisation dealt with.

==Background==
Fleming became interested in diamond smuggling after reading an article in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' in 1954 concerning the Sierra Leone diamond industry.{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=84}} Philip Brownrigg, an old friend from [[Eton College|Eton]] and a senior exec of De Beers, arranged for Fleming to visit the London Diamond Club to see diamonds being sorted and polished.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=31}} In 1955 Brownrigg also introduced Fleming to Sir Percy Sillitoe, former head of MI5, who was working for De Beers and investigating the illicit diamond trade through the International Diamond Security Organisation.{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=84}} Fleming met Sillitoe and used much of the research as background material for his fictional Bond novel, [[Diamonds Are Forever (novel)|''Diamonds Are Forever'']].{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=84}}

Fleming retained an interest in the subject and when Sillitoe suggested to the editor of ''The Sunday Times'', [[Denis Hamilton]], that the paper may want to write a story on the International Diamond Security Organisation, Hamilton offered the story to Fleming.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=310}} Sillitoe also offered his deputy, retired MI5 officer John Collard, as liaison for Fleming to interview.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=310}} During [[World War II]], Collard had assisted in the planning of [[Operation Overlord]] as part of [[MI11]] and had joined MI5 under Sillitoe at the war's end.&lt;ref name="Collard Obit"&gt;{{cite news|title=John Collard – Obituary|newspaper=[[The Times]]|date=13 November 2002|location=London|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst in MI5 he played a major role in the capture and conviction of the atomic spy [[Klaus Fuchs]],&lt;ref name="Collard Obit"/&gt; before Sillitoe had approached him in 1954 to work for the International Diamond Security Organisation.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=312}}

Fleming and Collard met in Tangiers on 13 April 1957; Fleming considered Collard to be a "reluctant hero, like all Britain's best secret agents".{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=171}} The pair spent two weeks discussing the issue of diamond smuggling,{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=16}} with Collard explaining what happened in South Africa and Sierra Leone. Fleming would then dictate an average of 5,000 words a day to a secretary.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=213}}

When the drafts of the books were shown to De Beers they objected to a number of areas and threatened an injunction against Fleming and ''The Sunday Times'', which resulted in much material being removed.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=17}} ''The Sunday Times'' serialised the book over six weeks, starting on 15 September 1957&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fleming|first=Ian|title=The Diamond Smugglers: The Million Carat Network|newspaper=[[The Sunday Times]]|date=15 September 1957|authorlink=Ian Fleming|location=London|pages=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and finishing on 20 October 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fleming|first=Ian|title=The Diamond Smugglers: 'Monsieur Diamant'|newspaper=[[The Sunday Times]]|date=20 October 1957|authorlink=Ian Fleming|location=London|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release and reception==
''The Diamond Smugglers'' was published in the UK in November 1957, by [[Jonathan Cape]], was 160 pages long and cost 12 [[Shilling (British coin)|shillings]] 6d.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=17}}&lt;ref name="Econ (1957)"&gt;{{cite news|title=All that Glitters|newspaper=[[The Economist]]|date=14 December 1957|location=London|page=955}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was published in the US on 13 May 1958, by [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] and cost $3.50.&lt;ref name="Barkham 1958"&gt;{{cite news|last=Barkham|first=John|title=Dark Dees and Glittering Gems|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=22 June 1958|page=BR17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The diamond smugglers.

===Reviews===
The book received largely positive reviews. Michael Crampton, writing for ''The Sunday Times'' considered it an "exciting and richly fascinating account"&lt;ref name="Crampton (1957)"&gt;{{cite news|last=Crampton|first=Michael|title=Smuggling the Sparklers|newspaper=[[The Sunday Times]]|date=1 December 1957|location=London|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thought Fleming authored a book that "ringing true as fact, is at the same time as highly entertaining as any fiction."&lt;ref name="Crampton (1957)"/&gt; ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'' obtained the services of the [[Cedric Brudenell-Bruce, 7th Marquess of Ailesbury|Earl of Cardigan]] to review the book. He noted that "the book is put together with a skill one would expect from Mr. Fleming",&lt;ref name="Cardigan (1958)"&gt;{{cite news|last=Cardigan|first=Earl of|title=The Lure of Diamonds|newspaper=[[The Times Literary Supplement]]|date=17 January 1958|authorlink=Cedric Brudenell-Bruce, 7th Marquess of Ailesbury|location=London|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; which leads to something that is "very entertaining reading".&lt;ref name="Cardigan (1958)"/&gt;

Reviewing for ''[[The Observer]]'', [[Anthony Sampson]] thought the book had "sparkle", adding that "it is often difficult to remember that we are not listening to his old hero Mr. James Bond."&lt;ref name="Sampson (1957)"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sampson|first=Anthony|title=Monsieur Diamant|newspaper=[[The Observer]]|date=15 December 1957|authorlink=Anthony Sampson|location=London|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sampson noted that the book included "several yarns which are worthy of the best spy-stories".&lt;ref name="Sampson (1957)"/&gt; The reviewer for ''[[The Economist]]'' enjoyed the book, but considered that while many of the stories "make good reading&amp;nbsp;... they are not new".&lt;ref name="Econ (1957)"/&gt; For ''[[The New York Times]]'', John Barkham thought that Fleming's foray into non-fiction produced "mixed results".&lt;ref name="Barkham 1958"/&gt; Although he found the subject interesting, the basis in interview resulted in a "choppy book"&lt;ref name="Barkham 1958"/&gt; that was "no more than an interim report".&lt;ref name="Barkham 1958"/&gt;

==Attempted film adaptation==

Shortly after publication, [[The Rank Group]] offered £13,500 (£{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|13500|1957}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} pounds{{inflation-fn|UK|df=yes}}) for the film rights to the book, which Fleming accepted, telling them he would write a full story outline for an extra £1,000.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=317}} Several contemporary newspaper reports referred to the project as "The Diamond Spy".&lt;ref name="Duns (2010)" /&gt; British producer George Willoughby subsequently obtained the rights for the book from Rank and tried to make a film with the actor [[Richard Todd]], eventually commissioning a screenplay from Australian writer [[Jon Cleary]], who finished a script in October 1964 that remained faithful in spirit to Fleming's book while also featuring elements familiar from the [[James Bond]] films.&lt;ref name="Duns (2010)"&gt;{{cite news|last=Duns|first=Jeremy|title=Ian Fleming's book about gem smuggling in South Africa is as thrilling as Bond, and should have been a blockbuster film starring Steve McQueen. So what went wrong?|newspaper=[[The Sunday Times]]|date=7 March 2010|authorlink=Jeremy Duns|location=London|pages=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kingsley Amis]] was also hired as a story consultant; in a letter to author Theo Richmond on 20 December 1965 Amis wrote he was having 'a horrible time' of writing an outline for Willoughby.{{sfn|Amis|2000|p=665}} [[W. H. Canaway|W.H.

'''''The Money of Invention: How Venture Capital Creates New Wealth''''' is a [[non-fiction]] book about [[venture capital]], written by [[Paul A. Gompers]] and [[Josh Lerner]], Professors of Business Administration at [[Harvard Business School]]. The book was first published in 2001 by the Harvard Business School Press. It is considered one of the best studies about the venture capital industry in United States.

== Overview ==
''The Money of Invention'' is a non-technical overview of the venture capital (VC), written for a general audience who wants to understand how VC industry works.&lt;ref name="kingston"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kingston|first=George|year=2003|title=Review of The Money of Invention|journal=Journal of Product Innovation Magazine|volume= 20|pages=325–332}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="morck"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morck|first=Randall |date=Dec 2002|title=Review: The Money of Invention|journal=Journal of Economic Literature|volume= 40|issue= 4|pages=1259–1261|jstor=3217345|publisher=American Economic Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book is composed of three major sections. The first section focuses on the perspective of the [[entrepreneur]]s, the second on the venture capitalists, and the third on what Gompers and Lerner call 'the emulators', organizations that try to copy the venture capital model.

In the first section, the authors identify the challenges entrepreneurs face when trying to raise [[capital (economics)|capital]]: (1) ''[[uncertainty]]'' about the future; (2) ''information gaps'' about the new product and the market for it; (3) the predominance of ''soft assets'' (e.g. [[patent]]s, [[trade secret]]s), in contrast to hard assets (e.g. land, equipment) that are easier to finance; and (4) the [[volatility (finance)|volatility]] of the ''product- and [[financial market]] conditions''. The authors then explain how VCs addresses these problems: screening mechanisms, [[due diligence]], [[staged financing]], [[syndicated investment]], [[executive compensation]] rules, financing covenants like [[convertible debt]], and [[corporate governance]] mechanisms are some of the solutions employed and discussed in the book.

In the second section, the authors focus on venture capital organizations. This section is part a historical account about the VC industry in United States, beginning with the founding of the first modern VC firm, [[American Research and Development Corporation]], by [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] president [[Karl Compton]] and [[Harvard Business School|HBS]] professor [[Georges Doriot]], in 1946. It also explores subsequent VC booms to the federally guaranteed [[Small Business Administration|Small Business Investment Companies]] Program in the 1960s and the 1974 [[Employee Retirement Income Security Act]], allowing a "prudent man" to hold some high-risk investments and increasing the flow of institutional money into the VC business. This section also describes the ways in which venture capital is structured, connecting its success to the [[limited partnership]] structure (e.g. [[management fee]]s, [[carried interest]]s, contractual restrictions); the mechanisms to raise funds and the emergence of the [[fund of fund]]s; and the challenges of the regulators to grapple with its information gap problems. The section closes with a detailed study of the [[overshooting]] phenomena that explains the volatility of the returns of the industry.

The third section of the book looks at efforts to apply the principles of venture investing in [[corporation|corporate]], [[public sector]], educational, and international settings. The authors argue that the lack of adequate [[Executive compensation|compensation]] schemes and [[organizational structure]]s usually limit the success of the venture capital model in these settings.

== Reviews ==
Randall Morck, an academic in the field, says that the book is "accessible to undergraduates and MBAs with little economics and to the general reader", but recommends ''[[The Venture Capital Cycle]]'' (Paul Gompers and Josh Lerner 1999, Cambridge: MIT Press) from the same authors for a high-level academic treatment of the same issues. He further states that the book may be interesting to economists, explaining that "the familiar problems of [[agency cost]], [[information asymmetry]], [[adverse selection]], and [[moral hazard]] assume overarching importance in the VC business." He praises the book for giving "clarifying to these problems", being useful to "counterweight the more traditional presentation of these issues".&lt;ref name=morck /&gt;

Reviewers also say that the authors "are strong supporters of the venture capital model", and hence "the reader is left with little doubt that the VC business has managed the trick at least tolerably well." &lt;ref name=kingston /&gt;&lt;ref name=morck /&gt; George Kingston points out that the book was published prior to the [[stock market]] downturn of the [[internet bubble]] and "it does not address the impact of these events on venture capital".&lt;ref name=kingston /&gt;

'''Vicente Soriano Serra''' (born 1953 in [[Puçol]], [[Valencian Community]], [[Spain]]) is a Valencian businessman who became the president and majority shareholder of [[Valencia CF]] in 2008, after reaching an agreement with [[Juan Bautista Soler]] to take over the presidency of the club and purchase Soler's shares to the value of 70.7 million euros. After an ill-fated attempt to resolve the club's debts, he was finally succeeded by [[Manuel Llorente]].

==Biography==
Having started out in the orange export business, in the 1990s he got involved in construction as a real estate broker, and subsequently as a property developer and representative of large investor groups.

He entered the world of soccer in 2004 when forming part of [[Francisco Roig Alfonso|Paco Roig]]'s "Cor i Força", the team that was running against then ousted president [[Jaume Ortí]]. [[Juan Bautista Soler]] won the election and Soriano accepted the role offered of vice-president.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.noticias.info/Archivo/2004/200410/20041006/20041006_35232.shtm Juan Bautista Soler, nuevo presidente del Valencia CF] (Juan Bautista Soler, new president of Valencia CF {{es icon}}), Valencia CF official website, October 6, 2004, (reposted on noticias.info, accessdate June 08, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

Soriano was charged with the selection of plans for the new stadium (see [[Nou Mestalla]]). Finally Soler rejected said projects. As a result, his relations with the then-president deteriorated. He was relieved of the vice-presidency in January 2006, although never he sold his allocation of shares. He resigned from the board in June 2007. He threatened to return to the club accompanied by [[Juan Villalonga]] to get a hold of Soler's stock, a situation that did not bear fruit. Villalonga briefly took over the running of the club in 2008, but when he proposed to buy the 37% held by Soler, Soriano reconciled with the majority shareholder and reached an agreement for the buying and selling of the Soler family shares in an amount set at 70.7 million euros, which was overturned after Soriano failed to sell the old Mestalla ground by the end of the year, finally resigning on 4 June 2009 because he had still failed to sell it. An attempt to raise capital by improving income from television rights also failed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2008/12/31/valencia/1230710021.html Las 'teles', el otro plan de Soriano] (Tellies, Soriano's other plan {{es icon}}), El Mundo, December 31, 2008 (accessdate June 08, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, following an absence of just one month, during which time [[Manuel Llorente]] took over, Soriano returned in July, having gained 51% of the shares and linked up with a mysterious company called [[Inversiones Dalport]], an investment company supposedly from [[Uruguay]] but with an office in [[Madrid]]. Soriano announced that none of the star players such as [[David Villa]], [[Juan Manuel Mata]] or [[David Silva]] would now need to be sold, as all the debts would be wiped clean.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thetimes.co.za/Sport/Article.aspx?id=1030046 Valencia refuse to sell players], The Times, June 07, 2009 (accessdate June 08, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, failure to find any information on Dalport on the Internet prior to the announcement prompted an outcry at the press conference. The media's suspicions were further heightened when fans noticed that the [[logo]] of an [[eagle]] used by Dalport had in fact been copied from a children's colouring-in book.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lavanguardia.es/deportes/noticias/20090706/53739362453/el-misterio-de-inversiones-dalport.html El misterio de Inversiones Dalport] (The mystery of Inversiones Dalport {{es icon}}), La Vanguardia, July 06, 2009 (accessdate July 09, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Prematurely ousted president Llorente echoed the fans' suspicions &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marca.com/2009/07/08/futbol/equipos/valencia/1247054723.html Llorente: "Si Soriano trae garantías bancarias, le hacemos 'pasillo'"] (If Soriano brings bank statements [ as proof ], we will hold our arms up into a tunnel for him to pass underneath {{es icon}}), Marca, July 08, 2009 (accessdate July 08, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Like 70% of fans, Llorente does not believe that Soriano will deliver, and warned that Valencia is opening themselves up to a potential investment scam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://valenciacf.lasprovincias.es/noticias/2009-07-08/internautas-cree-soriano-20090708.html El 70% de los internautas no cree a Soriano] (70% of web users does not believe in Soriano {{es icon}}), Las Provincias, July 8, 2009 (accessdate July 8, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

When, as predicted, Dalport failed to deliver, on August 21, 2009 [[Fundació VCF]] took over, becoming the main shareholder with 72.5% of shares, using a loan from [[Bancaixa]] and guaranteed by the local government. The Fundació is not allowed to end up with less than 51%, thereby ensuring stability within Valencia CF and cementing [[Manuel Llorente]] as the bona fide president.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.superdeporte.es/valencia/2009/08/24/fundacio-nueva-duena-vcf/69979.html La Fundació es la nueva dueña del VCF] (The Fundació are the new owners of VCF {{es icon}}), Superdeporte, August 22, 2009 (accessdate August 26, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Soler hired a [[hitman]] from Eastern Europe to [[kidnap]] Soriano. However, the hitman turned out to be working for the police, so Soler was arrested. While he is waiting to find out whether he will go to prison, he is not allowed to leave the country or go within 15 metres of Vicente Soriano.&lt;ref&gt;[http://prosoccertalk.nbcsports.com/2014/04/09/former-valencia-president-arrested-for-plotting-to-kidnap-successor/ Former Valencia president arrested for plotting to kidnap successor], NBC Sports, April 9, 2014 (accessdate April 10, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; This will not be easy, as his home is 20 metres from the door of Soriano's office.&lt;ref&gt;[http://futbol.as.com/futbol/2014/04/09/primera/1397041817_098671.html Juan Soler, imputado por tentativa de secuestro] (Juan Soler, charged with attempting kidnapping {{es icon}}), AS, April 9, 2014 (accessdate April 10, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Vincent Astor''' (November 15, 1891 – February 3, 1959) was a businessman, philanthropist, and member of the prominent [[Astor family]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

==Early life==
Called Vincent, he was born in New York City on November 15, 1891. He was the son of [[John Jacob Astor IV]], millionaire and inventor and his first wife, [[Ava Lowle Willing]], an heiress from [[Philadelphia]].

He graduated from [[St. George's School, Newport|St. George's School]], in [[Middletown, Rhode Island]], in 1910 and attended [[Harvard University]] from 1911 to 1912, leaving school without graduating.&lt;ref&gt;Harvard's Military Record in the World War. pg. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interests==

Like his father, Astor belonged to the New York [[Society of Colonial Wars]].  He served as commodore of the [[New York Yacht Club]] from 1928 to 1930.

Astor was interested in trains. In the early 1930s, he established an estate in [[Bermuda]] which included a private [[narrow-gauge railway]] and [[union station]] with the [[Bermuda Railway]]. The estate is now divided between several private owners, none of whom are part of the Astor family. As recently as 1992, the remains of some of his [[rolling stock]] were visible.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bermuda-attractions.com/bermuda_0002ca.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philanthropy==
Vincent Astor was, according to family biographer Derek Wilson, "a hitherto unknown phenomenon in America: an Astor with a highly developed social conscience." He was 20 when his father died, and, having inherited a massive fortune, dropped out of [[Harvard University]]. He set about to change the family image from that of miserly, aloof slum landlords who enjoyed the good life at the expense of others. Over time, he sold off the family's New York City slum housing and reinvested in reputable enterprises while spending a great deal of time and energy helping others. He was responsible for the construction of a large housing complex in the [[Bronx, New York|Bronx]] that included sufficient land for a large children's playground, and in [[Harlem]], he transformed a valuable piece of real estate into another playground for children.

Astor appeared as No. 12 on the first list of America's richest people, compiled by ''[[Forbes (magazine)|Forbes]]'' magazine. His net worth at the time was estimated at $75 million.

Amongst his holdings was ''[[Newsweek]]'' magazine which had for a time its headquarters in the former [[Six Times Square|Knickerbocker Hotel]] that had been built by his father; he was the magazine's chairman. He also inherited Ferncliff, the Astor family's {{convert|2800|acre|km2|adj=on}} estate near [[Rhinebeck, New York]], where his father had been born. Vincent Astor, however, would be the last family owner of the estate and occupant of the "Ferncliff Casino", a [[Stanford White]]—[[McKim Mead &amp; White]] designed 1904 [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux Arts style]] {{convert|40000|sqft|m2}} building, inspired by the [[Grand Trianon]] at [[Versailles Palace|Versailles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astorcourts.com/ |title=Astor Courts |publisher=Astor Courts |date= |accessdate=2012-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="blogspot1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://realestalker.blogspot.com/2010/07/astor-courts-historical-site-of-chelsea.html |title=The Real Estalker: Astor Courts, Historical Site of Chelsea Clinton's Hitching |publisher=Realestalker.blogspot.com |date=2010-07-30 |accessdate=2012-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On his death in 1959, Astor bequeathed a main house at Ferncliff to the Benedictine Hospital in [[Kingston, New York]], and later his widow, Brooke, donated "Ferncliff Casino" to the Catholic Archdiocese of New York, and sold off many parcels of the estate. In 1963, Homer Staley, a local retired businessman in the area, asked Brooke Astor to preserve the remaining natural acreage of [[woodland]]s from development. She donated the land to the Rotary Club of Rhinebeck, to become the [[Ferncliff Forest|Ferncliff Forest Game Refuge and Forest Preserve]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nynjctbotany.org/lgtofc/fernclif.html |title=Hiking Ferncliff Forest Game Refuge and Forest Preserve |publisher=Nynjctbotany.org |date= |accessdate=2012-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriages==
[[File:Helen Dinsmore Huntingdon.jpg|thumb|right|Helen Dinsmore Huntington]]
Astor married Helen Dinsmore Huntington, on April 30, 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9906E0DE173AE633A25752C0A9639C946596D6CF|title=Vincent Astor Weds Helen Huntington; Pallid from Illness, but Active in the Festivities After the Ceremony|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 1, 1914|accessdate=2012-10-02|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the ceremony, he was stricken with the [[mumps]], a disease that made him sterile; as for the bride, her friend [[Glenway Wescott]], the novelist, admiringly described her in his unpublished diaries as "a grand, old-fashioned lesbian."&lt;ref&gt;Glenway Wescott Collection, Beinecke Library, Yale University, [[New Haven, Connecticut]]&lt;/ref&gt; The couple divorced in 1940. A year later, Helen became the second wife of Lytle Hull (1882&amp;ndash;1958), a real-estate broker who was a friend and business associate of her former husband.

Shortly after his divorce, Astor married [[Mary Benedict Cushing]], the eldest daughter of Dr. [[Harvey Williams Cushing]] and Katharine Stone Crowell. Mary's sisters were [[Betsey Cushing Roosevelt Whitney|Betsey Maria Cushing]] and [[Babe Paley|Barbara "Babe" Cushing]]. They divorced in September 1953, and the following month, Mary wed James Whitney Fosburgh, a painter who worked as an art lecturer at the [[Frick Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Mary Fosburgh, 72.

She was 72 years old and lived at 32 East 64th Street. |work=[[New York Times]] |date=November 8, 1978 |accessdate=2010-03-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 8, 1953, several weeks after divorcing his second wife, Astor married the once-divorced, once-widowed [[Brooke Astor|Roberta Brooke Russell]]. According to an often-told story in society circles, Astor agreed to divorce his second wife only after she had found him a replacement spouse. Her first suggestion was Janet Newbold Ryan Stewart Bush, the newly divorced wife of James Smith Bush II (brother of [[Prescott Bush]]), who turned Astor down with startling candor, saying, "I don't even like you."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Janet Newbold married (1) Allan A. Ryan Jr, (2) William Rhinelander Stewart, and (3) James Smith Bush II. Her third husband, to whom she was married from 1948 until 1952, was a brother of Senator [[Prescott Bush|Prescott Sheldon]], an uncle of U.S. president [[George H. W. Bush|George Herbert Walker Bush]], and a great-uncle of U.S. president [[George W. Bush|George Walker Bush]]|publisher=Newyorksocialdiary.com|accessdate=2012-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Astor proceeded to tell her that he was not well and, though only in his early 60s, he could not be expected to live for very long, whereupon she would inherit his millions. At that, Janet Bush reportedly replied, "What if you do live?" Mary Cushing then proposed Brooke. Together, Vincent and Brooke developed the Vincent Astor Foundation, a foundation that was designed to give back to [[New York City]]. Brooke died in 2007 at the age of 105.

==Wartime service in the United States Navy==

===World War I===
Astor joined the [[United States Navy Reserve|Naval Reserve]] shortly after it was founded and was commissioned as an ensign on December 28, 1915. He was called to active duty as part of the New York Naval Militia in February 1917 by order of Governor [[Charles S. Whitman]] to help guard bridges and aqueducts against possible German sabotage. Astor was assigned to help guard the [[Brooklyn Bridge|Brooklyn]] and [[Manhattan Bridge|Manhattan]] bridges.&lt;ref&gt;"Armed Guards Patrol Bridges". ''New York Times''. February 5, 1917.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the declaration of war against Germany, Astor took advice from his friend and future president [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] and volunteered for active duty with the Navy on April 7, 1917. He went overseas on June 9 on the [[USS Noma|USS ''Noma'']] (Astor's own yacht which had been acquired as a patrol ship by the Navy). He was later assigned to the armed yacht [[USS Aphrodite|USS ''Aphrodite'']].

He was promoted to lieutenant (junior grade) on January 1, 1918, and to lieutenant on July 1, 1918. He was joined in France by his wife, who did charity work with the [[YMCA]] at the naval base in Bordeaux, while he served as Port Officer at [[Royan]].

His last assignment was as an officer on the captured German minelaying submarine [[SM U-117|''U-117'']] during her voyage to the United States.  Astor returned to the United States on the ''U-117'' on April 25, 1919, and was discharged on May 24.&lt;ref&gt;''St. George's School in the War''. 1920. pg. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, Astor became a companion of the [[Naval Order of the United States]].

===World War II===

In the quiet before the war,  Astor sailed the ''[[USS Nourmahal (PG-72)|Nourmahal]]'' in 1938 to Japan on a secret civilian mission for President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] to gather intelligence on the Japanese naval operations around the [[Marshall Islands]] in the Pacific Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph E. Persico]] begins his book ''Roosevelt's Secret War'' with a description of the FDR-Vincent Astor friendship, including this secret civilian mission to Japan.&lt;/ref&gt; As he had done with the ''Noma'' in the First World War, he lent his yacht ''[[USS Nourmahal (PG-72)|Nourmahal]]'' to the Coast Guard for service in the Second World War.

In [[World War II]], Astor again served on active duty with the Navy. He was called to active duty with the rank of commander and given assignment as Area Controller for New York.  In this position he coordinated merchant convoys leaving the city and provided informal intelligence work for President Roosevelt.

Perhaps Astor's longer lasting contributions were his weekly reports from the [[Chase Bank]] where his inside access included [[USSR]] account balances. On 13 Dec 1940, Astor began reporting to the [[US Treasury]] the Soviet weekly balances in an unbroken sequence (made by occasional substitutes) up through at least 1945.&lt;ref&gt;[[NARA]] Record Group 38, Records of the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations, Records of the Office of Naval Intelligence, Central Administrative Correspondence, 1930-48, L10-5/EF61, Russian Gov't Funds, Box 398-399.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early months of 1942, Astor suggested equipping fishing boats with radios so they could report U-boat sightings. One boat so equipped was [[Ernest Hemingway]]'s fishing yacht ''[[Pilar (Ernest Hemingway's boat)|Pilar]]''.

In June 1943, he was promoted to the rank of captain (with date of rank June 18, 1942).&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times''.  June 10, 1943.&lt;/ref&gt;

For his service in the Navy, Captain Astor was awarded the [[Navy Commendation Medal]], [[Naval Reserve Medal]] with star, [[World War I Victory Medal (United States)|World War I Victory Medal]], [[American Defense Service Medal]], [[American Campaign Medal]], and [[World War II Victory Medal]].

==Death==
Vincent Astor died on February 3, 1959, of a heart attack at his apartment at 120 East End Avenue in [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Vincent Astor Dies In His Home at 67 |url=http://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/vincent-astor-dies-his-home-at-67.html |quote=Vincent Astor, millionaire real estate owner and head of the American branch of the famous family, died yesterday in his apartment at 120 East End Avenue. Mr. Astor, who was 67 years old, succumbed to a heart attack at 1 A.M. A spokesman for the family said that Mr. Astor had been ailing recently, although the nature of the illness was not disclosed. He had intended to go to his winter home near Phoenix, Ariz., soon. |work=[[New York Times]] |date=February 4, 1959 |accessdate=2010-03-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Mason City Globe-Gazette]]'', February 3, 1959, page 1.&lt;/ref&gt; He left all of his money to the Vincent Astor foundation, with Brooke surprising many. She continued his philanthropic work.

Astor was first interred on his "[[Ferncliff Forest|Ferncliff Courts]]" estate ''("Astor Courts")'' on the [[Hudson River]] near [[Rhinebeck, New York]]. When Brooke later disposed of the property he was reinterred in the [[Sleepy Hollow Cemetery]] in [[Sleepy Hollow, New York]].&lt;ref name="blogspot1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorksocialdiary.com/node/1902816 |publisher=New York Social Diary|title=Astor Legacy|accessdate=2010-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Brooke is buried next to him.

His half-brother Jakey felt cheated and resentfully stated that Vincent "had the legal, not the moral right to keep all the money".&lt;ref name=Survivors&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Andrew|title=Shadow of the Titanic: The Extraordinary Stories of Those Who Survived|year=2012|publisher=Simon and Schuster}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jakey sued Brooke to inherit his money. He was certain that Vincent was "mentally incompetent" when signing his last will in June 1958 due to frequent smoking and alcoholism, though Brooke insisted otherwise. While Vincent was hospitalized, Brooke often brought him liquor. Jakey accused her of using the liquor to influence the will in her favor. Jakey ended up settling for $250,000. The rest of the money remained with the Vincent Astor foundation and Brooke.&lt;ref name=BrookeMemoir&gt;{{cite book|last=Gordon|first=Meryl|title=Mrs. Astor Regrets: The Hidden Betrayals of a Family Beyond Reproach|year=2008|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mount Astor==
A mountain in [[Antarctica]] bears Astor's name. Rising to a height of 3,710 m, [[Mount Astor]] is located in the [[Hays Mountains]] of the [[Queen Maud Mountains|Queen Maud Range]], and was named by [[Richard Evelyn Byrd|Rear Admiral Richard Byrd]] on his November 1929 expedition flight to the [[South Pole]]. Astor had been a contributing philanthropist to the expedition.&lt;ref name="USGIS"&gt;USGS Geographic Names Information System (GNIS), [http://geonames.usgs.gov/pls/gnispublic/f?p=gnispq:5:1300122222589224::NO::P5_ANTAR_ID:666 Mount Astor], retrieved 2010.07.26.&lt;/ref&gt;
