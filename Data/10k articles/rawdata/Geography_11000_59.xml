[[File:Photo interpretation.jpg|thumb|Photo interpretation at the [[United States|U.S.]] [[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency#National Photographic Interpretation Center (NPIC)|National Photographic Interpretation Center]] during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]].]]
Photographic interpretation is “the act of examining [[photographic image]]s for the purpose of identifying objects and judging their significance” (Colwell, 1997). This mainly refers to its usage in military [[aerial reconnaissance]] using photographs taken from [[reconnaissance aircraft]] and [[satellite|satellites]].

The principles of image interpretation have been developed empirically for more than 150 years.  The most basic are the elements of image interpretation: location, size, shape, shadow, tone/color, texture, pattern, height/depth and site/situation/association.  They are routinely used when interpreting aerial photos and analyzing photo-like images.  An experienced image interpreter uses many of these elements intuitively. However, a beginner may not only have to consciously evaluate an unknown object according to these elements, but also analyze each element's significance in relation to the image's other objects and phenomena.

== Elements of interpretation ==

=== Location ===
: There are two primary methods to obtain precise location in the form of coordinates.  1) survey in the field by using traditional surveying techniques or global positioning system instruments, or 2) collect remotely sensed data of the object, rectify the image and then extract the desired coordinate information.  Most scientists who choose option 1 now use relatively inexpensive GPS instruments in the field to obtain the desired location of an object.  If option 2 is chosen, most aircraft used to collect the remotely sensed data have a GPS receiver.

=== Size ===
: The size of an object is one of the most distinguishing characteristics and one of the more important elements of interpretation.  Most commonly, length, width and perimeter are measured.  To be able to do this successfully, it is necessary to know the scale of the photo.  Measuring the size of an unknown object allows the interpreter to rule out possible alternatives.  It has proved to be helpful to measure the size of a few well-known objects to give a comparison to the unknown-object.  For example, field dimensions of major sports like soccer, football, and baseball are standard throughout the world.  If objects like this are visible in the image, it is possible to determine the size of the unknown object by simply comparing the two.

=== Shape ===
: There is an infinite number of uniquely shaped natural and man-made objects in the world.  A few examples of shape are the triangular shape of modern jet aircraft and the shape of a common single-family dwelling.  Humans have modified the landscape in very interesting ways that has given shape to many objects, but nature also shapes the landscape in its own ways.  In general, straight, recti-linear features in the environment are of human origin.  Nature produces more subtle shapes.

=== Shadow ===
: Virtually all remotely sensed data are collected within 2 hours of solar noon to avoid extended shadows in the image or photo.  This is because shadows can obscure other objects that could otherwise be identified.  On the other hand, the shadow cast by an object act as a key for the identification of the object as the length of the shadow will be used to estimate the height of the object which is vital for the recognition of the object.  Take for example, the Washington Monument in Washington D.C.  While viewing this from above, it can be difficult to discern the shape of the monument, but with a shadow cast, this process becomes much easier.  It is a good practice to orient the photos so that the shadows are falling towards the interpreter.  A pseudoscopic illusion can be produced if the shadow is oriented away from the observer.  This happens when low points appear high and high points appear low.

=== Tone and color ===
: Real-world materials like vegetation, water and bare soil reflect different proportions of energy in the blue, green, red, and infrared portions of the electro-magnetic spectrum.  An interpreter can document the amount of energy reflected from each at specific wavelengths to create a [[spectral signature]]. These signatures can help to understand why certain objects appear as they do on black and white or color imagery. These shades of gray are referred to as tone. The darker an object appears, the less light it reflects.

Color imagery is often preferred because, as opposed to shades of gray, humans can detect thousands of different colors.  Color aids in the process of photo interpretation.

=== Texture ===
: This is defined as the “characteristic placement and arrangement of repetitions of tone or color in an image.”  Adjectives often used to describe texture are smooth (uniform, homogeneous), intermediate, and rough (coarse, heterogeneous).  It is important to remember that texture is a product of scale.  On a large scale depiction, objects could appear to have an intermediate texture.  But, as the scale becomes smaller, the texture could appear to be more uniform, or smooth.  A few examples of texture could be the “smoothness” of a paved road, or the “coarseness” a pine forest.

=== Pattern ===
: Pattern is the spatial arrangement of objects in the landscape.  The objects may be arranged randomly or systematically.  They can be natural, as with a drainage pattern of a river, or man-made, as with the squares formed from the United States [[Public Land Survey System]].  Typical adjectives used in describing pattern are: random, systematic, circular, oval, linear, rectangular, and curvilinear to name a few.

=== Height and depth ===
: Height and depth, also known as “elevation” and “bathymetry”, is one of the most diagnostic elements of image interpretation.  This is because any object, such as a building or an electric pole that rises above the local landscape will exhibit some sort of radial relief.  Also, objects that exhibit this relief will cast a shadow that can also provide information as to its height or elevation.  A good example of this would be buildings of any major city.

=== Site/situation/association ===
: Site has unique physical characteristics which might include elevation, slope, and type of surface cover (e.g., grass, forest, water, bare soil).  Site can also have socioeconomic characteristics such as the value of land or the closeness to water.  Situation refers to how the objects in the photo or image are organized and “situated” in respect to each other.  Most power plants have materials and building associated in a fairly predictable manner.  Association refers to the fact that when you find a certain activity within a photo or image, you usually encounter related or “associated” features or activities.  Site, situation, and association are rarely used independent of each other when analyzing an image.  An example of this would be a large shopping mall.  Usually there are multiple large buildings, massive parking lots, and it is usually located near a major road or intersection.

The '''Atlas Mountains''' ({{lang-ar|جِـبَـال الْأَطْـلَـس|jibāl al-ʾaṭlas}}; {{lang-ber|ⵉⴷⵓⵔⴰⵔ ⵏ ⵡⴰⵟⵍⴰⵙ}}, ''idurar n waṭlas'') are a [[mountain range]] in the [[Maghreb]]. It stretches around {{convert|2,500|km|mi|abbr=on}} through [[Morocco]], [[Algeria]]  and [[Tunisia]]. The range's highest peak is [[Toubkal]], with an elevation of {{convert|4167|m|ft|0}} in southwestern Morocco. It separates the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] and [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coastlines from the [[Sahara]] Desert.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kids.britannica.com/students/article/Atlas-Mountains/273001|title=Atlas Mountains - Students {{!}} Britannica Kids {{!}} Homework Help|website=kids.britannica.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Atlas mountains are primarily inhabited by [[Berbers|Berber]] populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://study.com/academy/lesson/atlas-mountains-facts-and-location.html|title=Atlas Mountains: Facts and Location {{!}} Study.com|work=Study.com|access-date=2017-07-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terms for 'mountain' in some [[Berber languages]] are ''adrar'' and ''adras'', which are believed to be [[cognate]]s of the toponym ''Atlas''. The mountains are home to a number of [[animal]] and [[plant]]s unique in Africa, often more like those of Europe; many of them are [[endangered]] and some have already gone [[extinct]].

==Geology==
[[File:Atlas-Mountains-Labeled-2.jpg|left|thumb|360px|Map showing the location of the Atlas Mountains across North Africa]]

The [[basement rock]] of most of Africa was formed during the [[Precambrian]] supereon and is much older than the Atlas Mountains lying on the continent. The Atlas was formed during three subsequent phases of Earth's geology.

The first tectonic deformation phase involves only the [[Anti-Atlas]], which was formed in the [[Paleozoic]] Era (~300 million years ago) as the result of continental [[collision]]s. [[North America]], [[Europe]] and [[Africa]] were connected millions of years ago.
[[File:Atlas Mountains tectonic plates.png|thumb|200px|right|The tectonic boundary]]
The Anti-Atlas Mountains are believed to have originally been formed as part of [[Alleghenian orogeny]]. These mountains were formed when Africa and America collided, and were once a chain rivaling today's [[Himalayas]]. Today, the remains of this chain can be seen in the [[Atlantic Seaboard fall line|Fall Line region]] in the [[Eastern United States]]. Some remnants can also be found in the later formed [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachians]] in North America.

A second phase took place during the [[Mesozoic]] Era (before ~66 My). It consisted of a widespread extension of the Earth's [[Crust (geology)|crust]] that [[rift]]ed and separated the continents mentioned above. This extension was responsible for the formation of many thick intracontinental [[sedimentary basin]]s including the present Atlas. Most of the rocks forming the surface of the present High Atlas were deposited under the ocean at that time.

Finally, in the [[Paleogene]] and [[Neogene]] Periods (~66 million to ~1.8 million years ago), the mountain chains that today constitute the Atlas were uplifted, as the land masses of Europe and Africa collided at the southern end of the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. Such [[Plate tectonics#Convergent (destructive) boundaries|convergent tectonic boundaries]] occur where two plates slide towards each other forming a [[subduction]] zone (if one plate moves underneath the other), and/or a [[orogeny|continental collision]] (when the two plates contain [[continental crust]]). In the case of the Africa-Europe collision, it is clear that tectonic convergence is partially responsible for the formation of the [[High Atlas]], as well as for the closure of the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] and the formation of the [[Alps]] and the [[Pyrenees]]. However, there is a lack of evidence for the nature of the subduction in the Atlas region, or for the thickening of the Earth's crust generally associated with continental collisions. In fact, one of the most striking features of the Atlas to geologists is the relative small amount of crustal thickening and tectonic shortening despite the important altitude of the mountain range. Recent studies suggest that deep processes rooted in the Earth's mantle may have contributed to the uplift of the High and Middle Atlas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://einstein.uab.cat/c_geotectonica/WebAtlas/AtlasLitho.htm UAB.es]{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Potential field modelling of the Atlas [[lithosphere]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://einstein.uab.cat/c_geotectonica/WebAtlas/MaterialAtlas/Ayarzaetal2005.pdf UAB.es]{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''Crustal structure under the central High Atlas Mountains (Morocco) from geological and gravity data'', P. Ayarza, et al., 2005, Tectonophysics, 400, 67-84&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural resources===
The Atlas are rich in [[natural resources]]. There are deposits of [[iron ore]], [[lead ore]], [[copper]], [[silver]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[rock salt]], [[phosphate]], [[marble]], [[anthracite coal]] and [[natural gas]] among other resources.

==Subranges of the Atlas Mountains==
[[File:Morocco High Atlas Mountains.jpg|thumb|Satellite photograph of the High Atlas and Anti-Atlas Mountains. North is at the bottom; the city of [[Goulmima]] can be seen at center left.|350px]]
The range can be divided into four general regions:
* [[Anti-Atlas]], [[High Atlas]] and [[Middle Atlas]] (Morocco).
* [[Tell Atlas]] (Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia).
* [[Aures Mountains|Aurès Mountains]] (Algeria, Tunisia).
* [[Saharan Atlas]] (Algeria).

===Anti-Atlas ranges===
{{main|Anti-Atlas}}

The Anti-Atlas extends from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] in the southwest of Morocco toward the northeast to the heights of [[Ouarzazate]] and further east to the city of [[Tafilalt]] (altogether a distance of approximately {{convert|500|km|mi|disp=or}}). In the south it borders the [[Sahara]]. The easternmost point of the anti-Atlas is the [[Jbel Saghro]] range and its northern boundary is flanked by sections of the [[High Atlas|High Atlas range]]. It includes the Djebel Siroua, a massif of volcanic origin with the highest summit of the range at 3,304 m. The Jebel Bani is a much lower range running along the southern side of the Anti Atlas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vchery.free.fr/mektoub/maroc/maroc.htm Des Montagnes du Sarho aux dunes de Merzouga]&lt;/ref&gt;

===High Atlas===
[[Image:AtlasOasis.jpg|thumb|200px|High Atlas, Morocco]]

{{main|High Atlas}}
The High Atlas in central Morocco rises in the west at the [[Atlantic ocean|Atlantic coast]] and stretches in an eastern direction to the Moroccan-Algerian border. It has several peaks over {{convert|4,000|m|mile|abbr=on}}, including the highest summit in North Africa, [[Toubkal]] ({{convert|4167|m|ft|abbr=on}}) and further east Ighil [[m'Goun]] ({{convert|4071|m|ft|abbr=on}}) the second major summit of the range. At the Atlantic and to the southwest, the range drops abruptly and makes a transition to the coast and the Anti-Atlas range. To the north, in the direction of [[Marrakesh]], the range descends less abruptly.

On the heights of [[Ouarzazate]] the massif is cut through by the [[Draa River|Draa Valley]] which opens southward. It is mainly inhabited by Berber people, who live in small villages and cultivate the high plains of the [[Ourika River|Ourika Valley]].

Near Barrage Cavagnac &lt;ref name=engineer&gt;{{lang-fr|[http://mangin2marrakech.canalblog.com/archives/2017/04/11/35168981.html  L'INGÉNIEUR CAVAGNAC, un nom bien connu des Anciens de Marrakech.... ]}} &lt;/ref&gt; there is a [[hydroelectric]] [[dam]] that has created the artificial lake [[Lalla Takerkoust]]. The lake serves also as a source for fish for the local fishermen.

The largest villages and towns of the area are [[Ouarzazate]], [[Tahannaout]], [[Amizmiz]], [[Imlil, Atlas Mountains|Imlil]], [[Tin Mal]] and [[Ijoukak]].

[[Image:Lake of Barrage Couvagnac Panoramic.jpg|thumb|600px|right|Panoramic picture of the artificial lake of Lalla Takerkoust near Barrage Cavagnac, with the [[hydroelectric]] [[dam]] (far right)]]

===Middle Atlas range===
{{main|Middle Atlas}}

The '''Middle Atlas''' is completely in Morocco and is the northernmost of its main three Atlas ranges. The range lies north of High Atlas, separated by the [[Moulouya River|Moulouya]] and [[Oum Er-Rbia River|Oum Er-Rbia]] rivers, and south of the [[Rif]] mountains, separated by the [[Sebou River]]. To the west are the main coastal plains of Morocco with many of the major cities and, to the east, the high barren plateau that lies between the Saharan and Tell Atlas. The high point of the range is the [[jbel Bou Naceur]] (3340m). The Middle Atlas experiences more rain than the ranges to the south, making it an important water catchment for the coastal plains and important for biodiversity. It is home to the majority of the world's population of [[Barbary macaque]].

===Saharan Atlas range===
{{main|Saharan Atlas}}

The Saharan Atlas of [[Algeria]] is the eastern portion of the Atlas mountain range.  Though not as high as the Grand Atlas, they are far more imposing than the Tell Atlas range that runs to the north of them and closer to the coast.  The highest peak in the range is the {{convert|2236|m|ft|abbr=on}} high Djebel Aissa. They mark the northern edge of the [[Sahara Desert]].  The mountains see some rainfall and are better suited to agriculture than the [[plateau]] region to the north.  Today most of the population of the region are Berbers ([[Imazighen]]).

===Tell Atlas range===
{{main|Tell Atlas}}
[[Image:Panoramic view of typical Berber village (Morocco - High Atlas Mountains).jpg|thumb|360px|right|Panoramic view of typical Berber village in the [[Morocco|Moroccan]] part of the High Atlas]]

The Tell Atlas is a mountain chain over {{convert|1500|km|mi}} in length, belonging to the Atlas mountain ranges and stretching from Morocco, through Algeria to Tunisia. It parallels the [[Mediterranean]] coast. Together with the Saharan Atlas to the south it forms the northernmost of two more or less parallel ranges which gradually approach one another towards the east, merging in ''Eastern Algeria''. At the western ends at the [[Middle Atlas]] range in Morocco. The area immediately to the south of this range is the high plateau of the [[Hautes Plaines]], with lakes in the wet season and salt flats in the dry.

===Aurès mountain range===
{{main|Aurès Mountains}}
[[File:Hammam Essalhine Aquae Flaviane Khenchela Mont View 2.jpg|thumb|left|Aures Mountains]]

The Aurès Mountains of [[Algeria]] and [[Tunisia]] are the farthest eastern portion of the Atlas mountain range. The [[Aurès]] [[natural region]] is named after the range.&lt;ref&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/algeria/51.htm Algeria - Ethnic Groups and Languages]&lt;/ref&gt;

The name is retained in [[Badakhshan Province]], which is one of the 34 [[provinces of Afghanistan]] and is located in North-East Afghanistan. Much of historic Badakhshan lies within [[Tajikistan]]'s [[Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region]] located in the south-eastern part of the country. The [[music of Badakhshan]] is an important part of the region's cultural heritage.

== Name ==
The name is derived from the Sasanian official title ''bēdaxš'' or ''badaxš'', which may be from an earlier *pati-axša; the suffix -''ān'' indicates that the country belonged, or had been assigned as a fief, to a person holding the rank of a ''badaxš''.&lt;ref&gt;W.

Badakhshan has a diverse ethno-linguistic and religious community. [[Tajiks]] and [[Pamiris]] are the majority while a tiny minority of [[Kyrgyzs]] and [[Uzbeks]] also are found in their own villages. There are also groups of speakers of several [[Pamir languages]] of the [[Eastern Iranian languages|Eastern Iranian language group]].&lt;ref&gt;G.

== History ==

=== Early history ===
Badakhshan was an important trading center during [[ancient history|antiquity]]. [[Lapis lazuli]] was traded exclusively from there as early as the second half of the [[4th millennium BC]]. Badakhshan was an important region when the [[Silk Road]] passed through. Its significance is its geo-economic role in trades of [[silk]] and ancient commodities transactions between the East and West.

According to [[Marco Polo]], Badashan/ Badakshan was a province where [[Balas ruby]] could be found under the mountain "Syghinan" (Shighnan).

===Early modern history===
[[File:Sultan Muḥammad Vays offers Babur a healthy horse to replace his ailing one.jpg|thumb|Sultan Muḥammad Vays offers Babur a healthy horse to replace his ailing one]]
The region was ruled over by the [[List of mirs of Badakhshan|mirs of Badakhshan]]. [[Sultan Muhammad (Badakhshan)|Sultan Muhammad]] of Badakhshan was the last of a series of kings who traced their descent to [[Alexander the Great]]. He was killed by [[Abu Sa'id (Timurid dynasty)|Abu Sa'id Mirza]] the ruler of [[Timurid Empire]] and took possession of Badakhshan, which after his death fell to his son, [[Sultan Mahmud (Timurid)|Sultan Mahmud]], who had three sons, Baysinghar Mirza, Ali Mirza and Khan Mirza. When Mahmud died, [[Amir Khusroe Khan]], one of his nobles, blinded Baysinghar Mirza, killed the second prince, and ruled as usurper. He submitted to Mughal Emperor [[Babur]] in 1504 CE. When Babur took [[Kandahar]] in 1506 CE, from [[Shah Beg Arghun]], he sent Khan Mirza as governor to Badakhshan. A son was born to Khan Mirza by the name of [[Mirza Sulaiman]] in 1514 CE.

After the death of Khan Mirza, Badakhshan was governed for Babur by Prince [[Humayun]], [[Sultan Wais Khan]] (Mirza Sulaiman's father-in-law), Prince [[Hindal]], and lastly, by Mirza Sulaiman, who held Badakhshan till October 8, 1541, when he had to surrender himself and his son, Mirza Ibrahim, to Prince [[Kamran Mirza]]. They were released by Emperor [[Humayun]] in 1545, and took again possession of Badakhshan. When Humayun had taken [[Kabul]], he made war upon and defeated Mirza Sulaiman who once in possession of his country, had refused to submit; but when the return of Prince Kamran Mirza from [[Sindh]] obliged Emperor Humayun to go to Kabul, he reinstated Mirza Sulaiman, who held Badakhshan till 1575. Bent on making conquests, he invaded [[Balkh]] in 1560, but had to return. His son, Mirza Ibrahim, was killed in battle.

When [[Akbar]] became Mughal Emperor, his stepbrother [[Mirza Muhammad Hakim]]'s mother had been killed by Shah Abul Ma'ali. Mirza Sulaiman went to Kabul, and had Abul Ma'ali hanged; he then had his own daughter married to Mirza Muhammad Hakim, and appointed Umed Ali, a Badakhshan noble, as Mirza Muhammad Hakim's agent in 1563. But Mirza Muhammad Hakim did not go on well with Mirza Sulaiman, who returned next year to Kabul with hostile intentions; but Mirza Muhammad Hakim fled and asked Akbar for assistance, so that Mirza Sulaiman, though he had taken [[Jalalabad]], had to return to Badakhshan. He returned to Kabul in 1566, when Akbar's troops had left that country, but retreated on being promised tribute.

Mirza Sulaiman's wife was [[Khurram Begum]], of the [[Kipchak people|Kipchak]] tribe. She was clever and had her husband so much in her power, that he did nothing without her advice. Her enemy was [[Muhtarim Khanum]], the widow of Prince Kamran Mirza. Mirza Sulaiman wanted to marry her; but Khurram Begum got her married, against her will, to Mirza Ibrahim, by whom she had a son, [[Mirza Shahrukh]]. When Mirza Ibrahim fell in the war with Balkh, Khurram Begum wanted to send the Khanum to her father, Shah Muhammad of [[Kashgar]]; but she refused to go. As soon as Shahrukh had grown up, his mother and some Badakhshi nobles excited him to rebel against his grandfather Mirza Sulaiman. This he did, alternately rebelling and again making peace. Khurram Begum then died. Shahrukh took away those parts of Badakhshan which his father had held, and found so many adherents, that Mirza Sulaiman, pretending to go on a pilgrimage to [[Makkah]], left Badakhshan for Kabul, and crossing the [[Indus]] went to India in 1575 CE. [[Khan Jahan I|Khan Jahan]], governor of the [[Punjab region|Punjab]], received orders from Emperor Akbar to invade Badakhshan, but was suddenly ordered to go to [[Bengal]] instead, as Mun'im Khan had died and Mirza Sulaiman did not care for the governorship of Bengal, which Akbar had offered him.

Mirza Sulaiman then went to [[Ismail II]] of [[Safavid]] [[Iran]]. When the death of that monarch deprived him of the assistance which he had just received, he went to Muzaffar Husain Mirza at Kandahar, and then to Mirza Muhammad Hakim at Kabul. Not succeeding in raising disturbances in Kabul, he made for the frontier of Badakhshan, and luckily finding some adherents, he managed to get from his grandson the territory between Taiqan and the [[Hindu Kush]]. Soon after Muhtarim Khanum died. Being again pressed by Shahrukh, Mirza Sulaiman applied for help to [[Abdullah Khan Uzbek]], king of [[Turan]], who had long wished to annex Badakhshan. He invaded and took the country in 1584; Shahrukh fled to the Mughal Empire, and Mirza Sulaiman to Kabul. As he could not recover Badakhshan for himself, and rendered destitute by the death of Mirza Muhammad Hakim, he followed the example of his grandson, and repaired to the court of Akbar who made him a Commander of six thousand. He lived out his life at Akbar's court in Lahore where he died in 1589 CE.

Like neighboring [[Balkh Subah]], Badakshan was shortly conquered in 1641 by Mughal [[padshah]] (emperor) [[Shah Jahan]], who turned it also into a short-lived [[subah]] (imperial top-level province), only to be lost again in 1647.

=== Later Emirates and Khanates ===

The old capital of Badakhshan was located in [[Kishim District]].&lt;ref name=noelle62&gt;Christine Noelle. ''State and Tribe in Nineteenth-Century Afghanistan: The Reign of Amir Dost Muhammad Khan (1826–1863)''. Surrey: Curzon Press, 1997. p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; In the 18th century the capital of Badakhshan was the town of [[Khamchan]], located three miles west of [[Faizabad]] and situated on both sides of the [[Kokcha River]].&lt;ref name=adamecp99&gt;[[Ludwig W. Adamec]]. ''Historical and political gazetteer of Afghanistan  Vol. 1. Badakhshan Province and northeastern Afghanistan''. [[Graz]] : Akad. Druck- und Verl.-Anst., 1972.p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; After the conquest of Badakhshan by [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]] in the later half of the 18th century, the capital was relocated to Faizabad, then known as Jauzun. In the 19th century the capital was moved to [[Jurm District|Jurm]],&lt;ref name=noelle62/&gt; until if finally was relocated back to [[Fayzabad, Badakhshan]].

[[File:The Khan of Badakhsan Asks to Surrender.jpg|thumb| In 1756 Badakhshan emir made the Chinese [[Qing]] dynasty to recognize the Elder of Badakhshan (the "grey beard") at Alti as sovereign in [[Kashgar]] and levied taxes on the city and parts of the province of [[Xinjiang]]]]
In 1750, [[Mir Sultan Shah]] ruler of Badakhshan rebelled against [[Khizri Beg]], Governor of [[Balkh]]. After consulting Ahmad Shah Durrani, Khizri Beg marched against Sultan Shah and the ''Wazir'' [[Shah Wali (Badakhshan)|Shah Wali]] aided the invading column. The pickets of Badakhshan, Chief of [[Taloqan]], fled from their postal approach of enemy and men of Badakhshan disgusted with their Chief because of his partiality to [[Kalmak]] and [[Kashghar]] foreigners waited on ''Wazir'' Shah Wali and hailed him as deliverer. Sultan Shah finding resistance hopeless fled to [[Ailu Basit]] in hills between [[Chiab]] and [[Pasakoh]]. The ''Wazir'' Shah Wali returned with force to [[Kabul]] leaving his country in charge of Afghan Governor. Sultan Shah returned slew the Governor and regained his country He was attacked by another rival [[Turrah Baz Khan]] who supported by Khizri Beg advanced on [[Faizabad]] and besieged it. Sultan Shah was taken prisoner. Kunduz Chief was unwilling to lose opportunity seized Turrah Baz Khan and sent both captives to [[Kunduz]] and annexed Badakhshan.&lt;ref name=review10badak&gt;{{cite web|title=Rough Chronological History Of Badakhshan, Etc|url=https://books.google.com/ebooks?id=UhMoAAAAYAAJ|work=The Asiatic quarterly review, Volume 10|accessdate=17 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1751 Sultan Shah was restored to liberty and his country. He punished marauders of [[Saki]] tribe who had desolated Chiab, [[Takhta Band]], [[Khalpan]] in Badakhshan. He slew a large portion and 700 horses were taken Place was marked by 200 heads of raiders on [[Kotal]] of [[Khoja Jarghatu]] and Saki gave no more trouble during Sultan Shah's lifetime This Chief built a fortress at [[Mashad]] in which he settled 600 families He made a rest house for travelers at [[Daryun]].&lt;ref name="review10badak" /&gt; In 1756 he made the Chinese recognize ''Akskal'' of Badakhshan at [[Alti]] in [[Xinjiang]] and levied taxes from Badakhshan families in city.&lt;ref name="review10badak" /&gt;

In 1759 another enemy appeared led by Kabad Khan the Kataghans attacked Fayzabad, Badakhshan took and put to death Sultan Shah and Turrah Baz Khan. [[Mir Muhammad Shah]] son of Sultan Shah escaped and retired to Tang i Nau from whence later he attacked Faizabad, put to death his youngest brother Nasarullah Khan Chief of that place under Government of Kabul, and took the Kingdom. His father's old enemy [[Kabad Khan]] whom patronage of Timur Shah Durrani (successor of Ahmad Shah Durrani) had elevated to Chiefship of Kunduz sent a force against Muhammad Shah under [[Kubadcha]] they wintered at [[Sang i Mohr]] and were joined by Kabad Khan in person. Muhammad Shah submitted and was at Kunduz detained 2 years. After that fortune turned against Kabad Khan. Throwing off his allegiance to Kabul when Timur Shah Durrani was marching against [[Sindh]] and Kashmir, Mizrab Bi grandson of Muhammad Bi (old Chief of Kunduz) uniting with Chief of Kubab attacked Kabad Khan, seized him and gave him to Mir Muhammad Shah who put him to death to avenge his father Mir Muhammad Shah returned to Badakhshan to find throne occupied by Bahadur Shah son of a former Chief who had taken Faizabad during captivity of Mir Muhammad Shah in Kunduz. Bahadur Shah was deposed and rightful owner recovered the throne Fortune frowned again on Mir Muhammad Shah. Bahadur Shah obtained aid of the [[List of mirs of Shighnan|Mir of Shighnan]] and took Fayzabad, Badakhshan. Mir Muhammad Shah fled to Chiab. In 2 years, Bahadur Shah was put to death by agent of Shighnan Chief named Bahadur who took throne. Muhammad Shah repeatedly attempted to expel him. But aid was refused him by Shighnan Chief and [[Kurghan Tappa]]. He regained throne on assassination of Bahadur by his servant. Late usurper's Ministers were all killed. Immediately Mir Muhammad Shah was engaged in hostilities with Jalal ud din Chief of Shighnan who rebelled and held out in fort till Mir Muhammad Shah invested it and rebel submitted. By clemency of victor he was reinstated Chief of Fayzabad, Badakhshan. In same year Shah Abul Faiz son of Shah Shuja of [[Ragh]] rebelled against Mir Muhammad Shah and was vanquished. The territory Mir Muhammad Shah divided as follows [[Iskashim]] was given to [[Mir Khan]];  [[Rushon District|Rushan]] to Shah Wali and [[Warduj]] to Mahmud Khan brother of [[Mir Ahmad Beg Kataghan]]. Mir Muhammad Shah also built a new fort named ''Sarai Bahadur''.&lt;ref name="review10badak" /&gt;

[[Khodai Nazar Beg Kataghan]] brother of [[Darab Bi]] expelled his 5 nephews from Kunduz and [[Aliwardi Beg]] Chief of [[Kurghan Tippa]] on pretence of avenging their wrongs attacked Khodai Nazar Beg and drove him from Kunduz. His avarice caused him to occupy country himself. Darab Bi's sons wandered to Badakhshan and Balkh Aliwardi Beg did not long enjoy fruits of treachery.&lt;ref name="review10badak" /&gt; In 1795, [[Emir Haidar]] of [[Emirate of Bukhara]] invaded Balkh and Kunduz annexed them and took Aliwardi Beg to [[Bukhara]] as prisoner.&lt;ref name="review10badak" /&gt;

In 1812, [[Mir Sultan Shah II]] succeeded as mir of Badakhshan after his father Mir Muhammad Shah's death in 1810. He remained friendly with his neighbors and country prospered. He recovered arrears of taxes from Chinese settlers and levied payment in advance. In 1814 he invaded [[Chitral]] took thousands of prisoners whom he sold in Balkh,  Bukhara,  [[Farghana]] and [[Khiva]]. He died in 1815 leaving 5 sons of whom [[Mir Yar Beg]] succeeded as ruler.&lt;ref name="review10badak" /&gt;

Meanwhile, Kunduz was still under Emirate of Bukhara and the wandering sons of Darab Bi Kataghan decided to attack and retake the city which they did in 1810. The Amir of Kunduz was now [[Mir Muhammad Murad Beg]], one of the brothers. Mir Yar Beg was now worried about the rising popularity and power of Mir Muhammad Murad Beg in the region. Eventually, in 1820 the two would face off at [[Darah Aim]] in which Mir Muhammad Murad Beg would be the victor. In 1822 4 brothers under the service of Mir Muhammad Murad Beg rebelled led by [[Kokan Beg]]. Mir Muhammad Murad Beg and Kokan Beg often fought with each other over territory inconclusively while battling against rebels in their own respective territories for years. Kokan Beg would be assassinated by his ally in [[Kashkar]] (lower Chitral) by being pushed down a precipice. Mir Muhammad Murad Beg taking advantage of this situation took Badakhshan by occupying Fayzabad.  But despite invading Badakhshan Mir Muhammad Murad Beg had little to no control over it. In fact Badakhshan was now contested by again by Mir Yar Beg, Sikandar Shah, Shahzada Mahmud, Abdul Ghazi Khan and Shah Suliman Beg who were in exile at [[Kholm, Afghanistan|Tashkurghan]] under protection of [[Mir Wali]]. Fayzabad had a small population under spiritual preceptor [[Mian Fazal Azim]], ''Sahibzada'' of [[Sirhind]]. [[Jirm]], [[Zardeo]], Mashad, [[Daraaim]] and Fayzabad were successively occupied by these chiefs. Fayzabad fell to Mir Yar Beg who rebuilt his fort and lived in city. The old dynasty thus was restored.&lt;ref name="review10badak" /&gt;

=== Between Afghanistan, Britain and Russia ===

In 1839 the occupation of Afghanistan by British drove Amir [[Dost Muhammad Khan]] into exile. He visited successively [[Khulam]] and Kunduz and was well received. They could not aid him against British and Dost Muhammad proceeded to the Emirate of Bukhara. The Emirate of Bukhara was then governed by [[Amir Nasrullah Khan]] who was addicted to the society of boys. [[Sher Ali Khan]] The son Dost Muhammad Khan was then a beardless youth and Nasrullah Khan coveted him. The Afghan pride of Sher Ali was however inflamed and he informed his father and brothers of the insulting desire of Nasrullah Khan. Dost Muhammad Khan then determined to leave Emirate of Bukhara but he found himself a prisoner and with difficulty escaped together with his sons to Balkh. Also in 1839,  Mir Muhammad Murad Beg again attacked [[Rustak]] in Badakhshan and appointed an officer of his own in [[Farkhar]]. Two months later he also attacked Mashad. But he failed to obtain a footing in Badakhshan which remained in possession of its hereditary Mirs.&lt;ref name="review10badak" /&gt;

In 1844, Mir Yar Beg while shooting was poisoned by [[Mir Ahmad Shah]] at the instigation of [[Sulaiman Beg]] and died on his return to Fayzabad. The instigator of the murder had been fascinated by the extraordinary beauty of the wife of Mir Yar Beg and was impelled by his passion for the lady to accomplish the death of her husband. On his death Sulaiman Beg took possession of Fayzabad and married his widow. Mir Ahmad Shah now discovered that the murder of Yar Beg was instigated by Sulaiman Beg with the object of possessing his wife and advancing against him expelled him from Faizabad of which he took possession himself. He then wrote to [[Mir Atalik Beg]], Chief of Kunduz, requesting his aid against [[Yusuf Ali Khan]] and [[Mir Shah]] to drive them out of Rustak. The letter did not reach its destination but fell by some means into hands of Mir Shah who forwarded it to Sulaiman Shah and invited him to a consultation at Rustak. Both chiefs then united and marched against Mir Ahmad Shah who was expelled to Kunduz. A new distribution was made of country [[Mir Shah]] occupied Fayzabad as supreme ruler of Badakhshan. Shah Sulaiman Beg received [[Dara Aim]]; Nasrullah Khan got Kashmir and Mashad. Rustak and Chiab were allotted to Yusuf Ali Khan. Jirm to Sikandar Shah and Zardeo Sarghalan was given to ''Shahzada'' [[Mahmud]].&lt;ref name="review10badak" /&gt;

From 1840&amp;ndash;1859 CE, Afghanistan and Emirate of Bukhara would struggle for Balkh and Badakhshan with Afghanistan succeeding. [[Mir Shah]], chief of Badakhshan and his feudatory of Rustak went to wait on [[Muhammad Azam Khan]] (son of Dost Muhammad Khan) with presents and offer of submission. Mir Shah, betrothed his niece (daughter of his brother Nizam-ud-din Khan) to Muhammad Azam Khan. A treaty was made with the Muhammad Azam Khan as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Ruler of Badakhshan, children and successors, agree to remain firm in allegiance to Amir of Kabul and officers in Balkh not to join foreign enemy against Amir of Kabul. Ruler of Badakhshan to furnish suitable contingent in difficulty and to aid Amir of Kabul and to give annual presents.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

But Mir Shah had troubles governing his region. Family quarrels over territory kept him busy till his death in 1862. He was succeeded by his son [[Mir Jahandar Shah]]. He too would get involved in various intrigues in the region as well as issues of succession in his neighborhood taking one side or the other. In 1865,  Mir Jahandar Shah sent his ambassador Syed Muhammad to the British Commissioner in [[Peshawar]] to establish friendly relations. However, peace would not last long as Dost Muhammad Khan died and his sons began to fight for the throne. eventually Mir Jahandar Shah was forced to take the side of Sher Ali Khan and Muhammad Azam Khan (who was now married to Mir Jahandar Shah's daughter as well). But [[Mohammad Afzal Khan]] would secure Kabul forcing Sher Ali Khan to retreat to [[Herat]]. Mir Jahandar Shah would hand over his allies to Mohammad Afzal Khan this angered Sher Ali Khan and his deputy in [[Akhcha]], Faiz Muhammad Khan who went into battle at [[Gulaugan]] against Mir Jahandar Shah and defeated him. After flight of Mir Jahandar Shah the country was divided. Mir Jahandar Shah seeks refuge in Kabul where he is restored a year afterwards to his ancestral throne by the influence of Abdur Rahman Khan son of the Mohammad Afzal Khan and by his popularity. His rival Mahmud Shah leaves without a struggle in October 1868. Mir Jahandar Shah of Badakhshan never asked forgiveness for hostilities to Amir Sher Ali Khan with Azam Khan and failed to wait on Governor of Balkh at [[Takhtapul]]. Sher Ali in October 1869 invited Mizrad Shah, Muhammad Shah and Ibrahim, deposed chiefs of Badakhshan and restored them. Mir Jahandar Shah fled to Kulab. In December 1869,  Mir Jahandar Shah left camp of Emir of Bukhara in [[Kulab]] and attacked Badakhshan and burned fort Zang Kila.&lt;ref name="review10badak" /&gt;

After being annexed by Afghanistan, Badakhshan was joined with [[Qataghan]] to create the [[Badakhshan-Qataghan district]] located in [[Afghan Turkestan Province]].

Eventually [[the Great Game]] would begin with the Russians instigating the Emirate of Bukhara to claim certain territories of Afghanistan and the British recognizing Afghanistan's claim to the territories of dispute. Badakhshan's boundaries were decided by the Anglo-Russian agreement of 1873, which expressly acknowledged "Badakhshan with its dependent district [[Wakhan]]" as "fully belonging to the Amir of Kabul", and limited it to the left or southern bank of the [[Amu Darya]] (also called Oxus).&lt;ref name="encycbadak"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Badakshan|volume=3|pages=182-183}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the west, Badakhshan was bounded by a line which crosses the [[Turkestan]] plains southwards from the junction of the [[Kunduz River|Kunduz]] and Amu Darya rivers until it touches the eastern water-divide of the [[Khulm River|Tashkurghan River]], and then runs southeast, crossing Kunduz, until it strikes the [[Hindu Kush]]. The southern boundary was carried along the crest of the Hindu Kush as far as the [[Khawak Pass]], leading from Badakhshan into the [[Panjshir Valley|Panjshir]] valley. Beyond this it was indefinite.

It was known that the [[Kafir]]s occupied the crest of the Hindu Kush eastwards of the Khawak, but how far they extended north of the main watershed was not ascertainable. The southern limits of Badakhshan became definite again at the [[Dorah Pass]]. The Dorah connects [[Zebak, Afghanistan|Zebak]] and [[Ishkashim, Afghanistan|Ishkashim]] at the elbow, or bend, of the Oxus with the Lutku valley leading to Chitral. From the Dorah eastwards the crest of the Hindu Kush again became the boundary until it effects a junction with the [[Karakoram|Muztagh]] and [[Sarikol Range|Sarikol]] ranges, which shut off China from Russia and India. Skirting round the head of the [[Tagdumbash Pamir]], it finally merged into the [[Pamir Mountains]] boundary, and turned westwards, following the course of the Oxus, to the junction of that river and the [[Khanabad River|Khanabad]] (Kunduz).&lt;ref name="encycbadak" /&gt;

So far as the northern boundary followed the Oxus stream, under the northern slopes of the Hindu Kush, it was only separated by the length of these slopes (some 8 or 10 miles) from the southern boundary along the crest. Thus Badakhshan reached out an arm into the Pamirs eastwards - bottle-shaped - narrow at the neck (represented by the northern slopes of the Hindu Kush), and swelling out eastwards so as to include a part of the great and little Pamirs.&lt;ref name="encycbadak" /&gt;

Before the boundary settlement of 1873 the small states of Rushan and [[Shugnan]] extended to the left bank of the Oxus, and the province of [[Darvaz (region)|Darwaz]], on the other hand, extended to the right bank. Then, however, the Darwaz extension northwards was exchanged for the [[Russian Pamir]] extension westwards, and the river throughout became the boundary between Russian and Afghan territory; the political boundaries of those provinces and those of Wakhan were no longer coincident with their geographical limits.&lt;ref name="encycbadak" /&gt;

Chitral, Yarkand and Ferghana became shelters for refugees in 1887 and 1883 from Badakhshan who fled from the campaigns of [[Abdur Rahman Khan|Abdul Rahman]].&lt;ref name="Bergne2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Bergne|title=The Birth of Tajikistan: National Identity and the Origins of the Republic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3coojMwTKU8C&amp;pg=PA90#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date=15 June 2007|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-1-84511-283-7|pages=90–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following were the chief provincial subdivisions of Badakhshan, omitting Rushan and Shugnan: on the west Rustak, Kataghan, Ghori, Narin and Anderab; on the north Darwaz, Ragh and Shiwa; on the east Charan, Ishkashim, Zebak and Wakhan; and in the centre Faizabad, Farkhar, Minjan and Kishm. There were others, but nothing certain is known about these minor subdivisions.&lt;ref name="encycbadak"/&gt; Consequently, most western part of modern [[Gorno-Badakhshan]] became part of [[Emirate of Bukhara]], while most of it became part of Fergana Province of [[Russian Turkistan]]. This arrangement was lasted till 1920.

In 1890 Qataghan-Badakhshan District was separated from Afghan Turkestan and [[Qataghan-Badakhshan Province]] was created. Administration of the province was assigned to the [[Northern Bureau]] in [[Kabul]].&lt;ref name=mcchesiraj&gt;Fayz Muḥammad Katib. Siraj al-tawarıkh. V. III.

This border would persist despite changes in governments.

In 1902 the [[Bukhara]]n (Western) Pamir comes under the Russian military administration.
In November 1918 the last Czarist Russian troops recognize Bolshevik rule, but in December 1919 the anti-Bolshevik Russian "Peasant's Army" from [[Fergana]] takes over. From April 1920 the vacuum of power is filled by an attempt to establish Bukharan rule until June 1920 when the Bukharans are expelled by local forces, Bolshevik rule is restored: the Stalinist [[Soviet Union]] have seized the Bukharan part of [[Gorno-Badakshan]].
 
It was merged with the Russian (since 1895) part in 1924 to be organized as the Gorno-Badakhshan autonomous ''oblast'' (province) within the [[Tajik SSR]] in 1929.
In April 1992? - 1993 a Pamiri-Badakshoni [[Autonomous Republic]] is declared within independent post-Soviet [[Tajikistan]], on 6 November 1994 becoming the [[Kohistan-Badakhshan Autonomous Province]], alias Gorno-Badakhshan [[Autonomous Province]] or Mountainous Badakhshon Autonomous Veloyat.

In 1963 Badakhshan included the districts of [[Baghlan]], [[Pul-i-Khumri]], [[Dushi District|Dushi]], [[Dahan-i-Ghori]], [[Kanabad]], [[Andarab]], [[Kunduz]], [[Hazrat-i-Imam]], and [[Taloqan]]. In 1963 Qataghan-Badakhshan Province was abolished and since then the territory was divided into four separate provinces: Badakhshan, [[Baghlan]], [[Kunduz]] and [[Takhar]].&lt;ref name=adamecp26&gt;[[Ludwig W. Adamec]]. ''Historical and political gazetteer of Afghanistan  Vol. 1. Badakhshan Province and northeastern Afghanistan''. [[Graz]] : Akad. Druck- und Verl.-Anst., 1972. p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the height of [[Taliban]] strength during the [[Civil war in Afghanistan (1996–2001)|Afghan Civil War]] circa 2000, [[Badakhshan Province|Afghan Badakhashan]] was a stronghold for the [[Northern Alliance]].

== Geography ==
The conformation of the mountain districts, which comprise all the southern districts of Badakhshan and the northern hills and valleys of [[Nuristan]] (the former Kafiristan), is analogous to that of the rest of the Hindu Kush westwards. The Hindu Kush represents the southern edge of a great central upheaval or plateau. It breaks up into long spurs southwards, deep amongst which are hidden the valleys of Nuristan, almost isolated from each other by the rugged and snow-capped altitudes which divide them. To the north the plateau gradually slopes away towards the Oxus, falling from an average altitude of 15,000 feet to 4,000 feet about [[Fayzabad, Badakhshan|Faizabad]], in the centre of Badakhshan, but tailing off to ~100 at [[Kunduz]], in Kataghan, where it merges into the flat plains bordering the [[Oxus river]].&lt;ref name="encycbadak" /&gt;

The [[Kokcha River]] traverses Badakhshan from southeast to northwest, and, with the [[Kunduz River|Kunduz]], drains all the northern slopes of the Hindu Kush west of the [[Dorah Pass]]. Some of its sources are near [[Zebak]], close to the great bend of the Oxus northwards, so that it cuts off all the mountainous area included within that bend from the rest of Badakhshan. Its chief affluent is the Minjan, which [[Sir George Robertson]] found to be a considerable stream where it approaches the Hindu Kush close under the Dorab. Like the Kunduz, it probably drains the northern slopes of the Hindu Kush by deep lateral valleys, more or less parallel to the crest, reaching westwards towards the [[Khawak Pass]]. From the Oxus (1,000 feet) to Faizabad (4,000 feet) and Zebak (8,500 feet) the course of the Kokcha offers a high road across Badakhshan; between Zebak and [[Ishkashim, Afghanistan|Ishkashim]], at the Oxus bend, there is but an insignificant pass of 9,500 feet; and from Ishkashim by the [[Panj River]], through the [[Pamirs]], is the continuation of what must once have been a much-traversed trade route connecting Afghan Turkestan with [[Kashgar]] of China. It is undoubtedly one of the great continental high-roads of Asia. North of the Kokcha, within the Oxus bend, is the mountainous district of [[Darvaz (region)|Darwaz]], of which the physiography belongs rather to the Pamir type than to that of the Hindu Kush.&lt;ref name="encycbadak" /&gt;

A very remarkable meridional range extends for 100 miles northwards from the Hindu Kush (it is across this range that the route from Zebak to Ishkashim lies), which determines the great bend of the Oxus river northwards from Ishkashim, and narrows the valley of that river into the formation of a trough as far as the next bend westwards at Kala Wamar. The western slopes of this range drain to the Oxus either northwestwards, by the Kokcha and the Ragh, or else they twist their streams into the Shiwa, which runs due north across [[Darvaz (region)|Darwaz]]. Here again we find the main routes which traverse the country following the rivers closely. The valleys are narrow, but fertile and populous. The mountains are rugged and difficult; but there is much of the world-famous beauty of scenery, and of the almost phenomenal agricultural wealth of the valleys of [[Bukhara]] and [[Ferghana]] to be found in the recesses of Badakhshan.&lt;ref name="encycbadak" /&gt;

A '''boundary marker''', '''border marker''', '''boundary stone''', or '''border stone''' is a robust physical marker that identifies the start of a land [[Border|boundary]] or the change in a boundary, especially a change in direction of a boundary.&lt;ref name="straight-border" /&gt; There are several other types of named border markers, known as '''pillars''', '''obelisks''', and '''corners'''.&lt;ref name="straight-border" /&gt;  Border markers can also be markers through which a border line runs in a straight line to determine that border.&lt;ref name="straight-border"&gt;{{cite conference | title=AN HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE – Longitude 129 degrees east, and why it is not the longest, straight line in the world | publisher=Eyepiece – Official Organ of The Institution of Surveyors, Australia, W.A. Division | accessdate=15 January 2012 | author=Porter, John | conference=National Perspectives – 32nd Australian Surveyors Congress Technical Papers 31 March – 6 April 1990 | location=Canberra: The Institution | pages=18–24 |date=June 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can also be the markers from which a border marker has been fixed.&lt;ref name="straight-border" /&gt;

==Purpose ==
According to Josiah Ober, boundary markers are "a way of imposing human, cultural, social meanings upon a once-undifferentiated natural environment." Boundary markers are linked to social hierarchies, since they derive their meaning from the authority of a person or group to declare the limits of a given space of land for political, social or religious reasons. Ober notes that "determining who can use parcels of arable land and for what purpose, has immediate and obvious economic implications."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Ober, Josiah. "Greek Horoi: Artifactual Texts and the Contingency of Meaning." ''Methods in the Mediterranean: Historical and Archaeological Views of Texts and Archaeology.'' Ed. David. B. Small. Leiden: Brill, 1995. URL: http://www.stanford.edu/group/dispersed_author/docs/GreekHoroi.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Many borders were drawn along invisible lines of [[latitude]] or [[longitude]], which often created a need to mark these borders on the ground, as accurately as possible, using the technology of the day.&lt;ref name="straight-border" /&gt; Advances in [[GPS]] technology have shown that there are many borders inaccurately marked on the ground.&lt;ref name="straight-border" /&gt;

Boundary markers have often been used to mark critical points{{clarify|date=February 2016}} on political boundaries, i.e. those between countries, [[Federated state|states]] or local administrations, but have also been used to mark out the limits of private landholdings, especially in areas where fences or walls are impractical or unnecessary.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

In developed countries the use of markers for land ownership has in many places been replaced by maps and land ownership registration. Boundary markers are not legal markers in Western countries and may have troublesome legal effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fairview-industries.com/gismodule/PartTwoMisplacedBoundary.html |title=Cadastral Information For GIS Specialists - Case Of The Misplaced Boundary Marker |publisher=Fairview-industries.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110921084505/http://www.fairview-industries.com/gismodule/PartTwoMisplacedBoundary.html |archivedate=21 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, boundary markers have legal meaning in [[Japan]], and are generally installed across the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ja.wikibooks.org/wiki/%E6%B0%91%E6%B3%95%E7%AC%AC229%E6%9D%A1 Civil Law 229]; [http://www.hiroshima-chousashi.or.jp/kanri/kan0page.htm more information] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130103125854/http://www.hiroshima-chousashi.or.jp/kanri/kan0page.htm |date=3 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Markers are still used extensively for marking international borders, which are traditionally classified into two categories: natural boundaries, correlating to topographical features such as rivers or mountain ranges, and artificial boundaries, which have no obvious relation to topography. The latter category includes borders defined by boundary markers such as stones and walls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Settlement of Boundary Disputes in International Law|last = Cukwurah|first = A. Oye|publisher = Manchester University Press|year = 1967|location = Manchester|pages = 16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; International boundary markers are placed and can be maintained by mutual agreement of the bordering countries.

==Construction==
Boundary markers, traditionally, were often made of [[Rock (geology)|stone]], but later many have been made with concrete or a mixture of materials.&lt;ref name="kimberley"&gt;

== History ==

=== Asia ===

==== China ====
The oldest known boundary stone in China is from Jiangsu Province. Dating from 12 A.D., it bears the inscription "the sea area from Jiaozhou Bay to the east of Guixan county belongs to Langya Shire and the waters from the south of Guixan county to the east of the estuary of Guanhe River belongs to Donghai Shire."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/regional/2015-05/18/content_20750795.htm|title = The boundary stone of Han Dynasty in Suma Bay  - China - Chinadaily.com.cn|last = 潘其|website = www.chinadaily.com.cn|access-date = 2016-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, the border between Russia and China was formally demarcated with boundary stones as the result of the Treaty of Kiakhta in 1727.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = China Marches West: The Qing Conquest of Central Asia|last = Perdue|first = Peter C.|publisher = Harvard University Press|year = 2009|location = Cambridge, MA|pages = 289}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the nineteenth century, stones were used to outline the limits of the International Settlement in Shanghai.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Britain and China, 1840-1970: Empire, Finance and War|author1=Bickers, Robert |author2=Jonathan J. Howlett |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher = Routledge|year = 2015|location = London|pages = 190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Thailand ====
In ancient Thailand, sacred boundary stones called ''Sema Hin'' delimited Buddhist temple precincts. In some cases they feature inscriptions recounting the history of the temple;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author= Phetsanghan, Phairot |author2= Songkoon Chantachon |author3= Boonsom Yodmalee |last-author-amp= yes|date = 2009|title = Sema Hin Isan, the Origin of the Temple Boundary Stones in Northeast Thailand|url = http://medwelljournals.com/abstract/?doi=sscience.2009.186.190|journal = The Social Sciences |volume=4 |pages=186–190|access-date = March 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; others were carved with wheels of the law,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Art and Architecture of Thailand: From Prehistoric Times Through the Thirteenth Century|last = Woodward|first = Hiram, W.|publisher = Brill|year = 2003|location = Leiden|pages = 104}}&lt;/ref&gt; while some specimens consist of unfinished stone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Art and Architecture of Thailand: From Prehistoric Times Through the Thirteenth Century|last = Woodward|first = Hiram W.|publisher = Brill|year = 2003|location = Leiden|pages = 100}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to temples, ''sema'' could enclose statues of Buddha or sacred mounds.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Near East and Africa ===

==== Israel ====
According to B. S. Jackson, stones were put in place in ancient Israel to "mark the boundary of a territory (public or private), and to seek to deter potential violators of that boundary through the use of threats."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The World of Ancient Israel: Sociological, Anthropological and Political Perspectives|editor-last = Clements|editor-first = Ronald E. |publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 1991|location = Cambridge|pages = 190}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hebrew Bible contains a strict prohibition against the unauthorized displacement or removal of boundary markers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Settlement of Boundary Disputes in International Law|last = Cukwurah|first = A. Oye|publisher = Manchester University Press|year = 1967|location = Manchester|pages = 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Egypt ====
An example of boundary markers in ancient Egypt were the boundary stelae of Akhenaten. They defined the limits of the sacred city of Akhet-Aten, built by Akhenaten as the center of the Aten religious cult which he founded. Egyptologists categorize the stelae based on whether they are inscribed with the "Earlier Proclamation," a general explanation of why the location was selected and how the city would be designed, or the "Later Proclamation," which provides additional details about the perimeters of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Boundary Stelae of Akhenaten|last = Murnane|first = William J.|publisher = Kegan Paul Int.|year = 1993|location = London|pages = 1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Europe ===
[[File:German troops crossing the Soviet border.jpg|thumb|upright|German troops at the Soviet state border marker during [[Operation Barbarossa]], 1941]]

==== Finland ====
[[File:Kaavi, Pohjois-Savo.JPG|thumb|upright=0.75|left|A typical roadside border marker in Finland, entering [[Kaavi]] municipality in [[Pohjois-Savo]] region.]]
[[Glacial erratic]]s and similar natural stones were often used as boundary markers between properties. Knowledge of their locations was typically maintained by oral tradition, wherein men of each house would walk the length of the border. These stones then became boundary markers for [[Municipalities of Finland|municipalities]], and eventually provinces and countries. For example, Kuhankuono is a stone that marks the [[Quadripoint#Multipoints of greater numerical complexity|multipoint]] border between seven municipalities in [[Kurjenrahka National Park]] near [[Turku]]. Today, however, steel rods topped with a cube painted orange are usually used. Municipalities often post a traffic sign featuring their coat of arms on the border on major roads. On the [[Finnish-Russian border]], many historical border stones, marked with Swedish and Imperial Russian symbols, are still in use. The actual Finnish-Russian border is marked by small white bollard, but on both sides of the border there are large striped bollards decorated with a coat of arms: a blue/white bollard on the Finnish side, a red/green bollard on the Russian side.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iltalehti.fi/uutiset/2015082320139715_uu.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; Artificial cairns are found on the Norway-Russia-Finland tripoint ([[Treriksrøysa]]) and Norway-Sweden-Finland tripoint ([[Three-Country Cairn]]). The Sweden-Finland border on [[Märket]] is marked with holes drilled to the rock, because seasonal [[pack ice]] can shear off any protruding markers. In folklore, a type of [[haltija]], ''rajahaltija'', a kind of a local spirit, was believed to haunt borders that had been unjustly moved.

==== Greece ====
The earliest reference to a boundary stone in Greek literature is in the ''Iliad'', which describes the goddess Athena using one as a projectile. Boundary stones, known as ''horos'', could be made of either carved or undressed stones, and were typically inscribed with the Greek word ''horos''. One such stone was used to indicate the edge of the Athenian ''agora''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The practice of separating areas of land with boundary stones, though common, was widely considered by classical writers to be a violation of the principle of communal land ownership.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Science and Civilization in China: Volume 2, History of Scientific Thought|last = Needham|first = Joseph|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 1956|location = Cambridge|pages = 127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Rome ====
In ancient Roman religion, the god [[Terminus (god)|Terminus]] was worshiped as the patron god of boundary markers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Settlement of International Boundary Disputes in International Law|last = Cukwurah|first = A. Oye|publisher = Manchester University Press|year = 1967|location = Manchester|pages = 11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ovid, in a hymn directed to the god, wrote: "O Terminus, whether thou art a stone or a stump buried in the field, … thou dost set bounds to people and cities and vast kingdoms".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Brown's Boundary Control and Legal Principles|author1=Robillard, Walter G. |author2=Donald A. Wilson |author3=Curtin M. Brown  |last-author-amp=yes |publisher = John Wiley|year = 2009|location = Hoboken, NJ|pages = 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numa Pompillius made the first Roman law requiring boundary stones around private property and instituting capital punishment for anyone found guilty of moving these stones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Settlement of Boundary Disputes in International Law|last = Cukwurah|first = A. Oye|publisher = Manchester University Press|year = 1967|location = Manchester|pages = 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Monaco ====
In 1828, the [[Monaco|Principality of Monaco]] and the [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia]] established a physical border with 91 boundary stones, each numbered 1 to 91, running along the border from present-day [[Fontvieille, Monaco|Fontvieille]] to [[Menton|Menton-Garavan]].&lt;ref&gt;http://bornes.frontieres.free.fr/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to 1848, the Principality of Monaco included the villages of Roquebrune, Monti, Garavan and Menton.  Of the original 91 boundary stones only 12 remain: 6 within the [[Monaco|Principality of Monaco]], 3 in [[Roquebrune-Cap-Martin]], and 3 in [[Menton]].  The boundary stones numbered 9, 12, 15, and 31 are located in [[Monaco]].  Another stone has been cast in concrete in the Sainte-Cécile area of [[Monaco]] thus rendering its number illegible.  Stone number 55, originally located in [[Roquebrune-Cap-Martin|Roquebrune]], was given as a gift from the city of [[Roquebrune-Cap-Martin|Roquebrune]] to the [[Monaco|Principality of Monaco]] and is now located in [[Monaco]]'s city hall.  Stones numbered 56, 57, and 58 are located in [[Roquebrune-Cap-Martin|Roquebrune]].  Stones numbered 62, 71, and 73 are located in [[Menton]].  All the boundary stones have three engraved sides: one side with their individual numbers (1 to 91), one side with the letter "M" indicating [[Monaco]]'s territory, and one side with a cross (+) indicating the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia's territory.  The cross represents the coat of arms of the [[House of Savoy]], rulers of Piedmont-Sardinia.

===Western Australia===
The history of [[Western Australia border#Marking the WA border on the ground|marking the Western Australian border on the ground]] states that the "Austral Pillar" and the "Deakin Pillar" are points used to determine their position east of [[Greenwich]] and then fix a border from, in this case used to determine the line of the [[129th meridian east]] [[longitude]], as the [[Western Australia border|Western Australian border]].&lt;ref name="straight-border" /&gt; The Deakin [[Obelisk]] and the Kimberley Obelisk in Australia are used in a slightly different way, in that a line is run north and south through a point on the obelisks, formed by a copper plug embedded into the top centre of the concrete obelisks.&lt;ref name="straight-border" /&gt; The "corners" in Australia, such as [[Cameron Corner Survey Marker|Cameron Corner]], [[Haddon Corner]], [[Poeppel Corner]], and [[Surveyor Generals Corner]], are where multiple borders meet or a border changes direction.&lt;ref name="straight-border" /&gt;

=== United States ===

==== Hawaii ====
The basic unit of the ancient Hawaiian land division system was the ''ahupua'a'', a self-sustaining agricultural district.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Hawaii: A History of the Big Island|last = Oaks|first = Robert|publisher = Arcadia Publishing|year = 2003|location = Charleston|pages = 13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The places where a road crossed the border of an ''ahupua'a'' were marked with distinctive altars, known as ''ahu'' or (stone) piles. These altars served not only as boundary markers but also as sites for the performance of religious rituals related to land taxation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = A Dictionary of Hawaiian Legal Land Terms|last = Lucas|first = Paul Nahoa|publisher = University of Hawaii Press|year = 1995|location = Honolulu|pages = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; C.

==== Washington, D.C. ====
The original boundaries of the District of Columbia were marked using boundary stones. These were made of saw-cut sandstone blocks and stood two feet high when set in the ground. Ten boundary stones were placed along each side of the 100 square mile (259 square kilometer) district of Columbia. Although the original surveyors intended each side to be ten miles (16 kilometers) long, their measurements were often inaccurate, resulting in the sometimes significant misplacement of stones and the overall skewing of the District boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Woodward|first = Fred E.|date = 1907|title = A Ramble Along the Boundary Stones of the District of Columbia with a Camera|journal = Historical Society of Washington, D.C. |pages=63–87}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these discrepancies are intentional, because the ground at the exact mile point was covered in water; “in such cases,” Andrew Ellicott, the leader of the surveying crew, noted in 1793, “the stones are placed on the nearest firm ground and the true distance in miles and poles is marked on them”.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Nye|first = Edwin Darby|date = 1971|title = Revisiting Washington's Forty Boundary Stones|journal = Historical Society of Washington, D.C. |pages=740–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Information engraved on the stones includes the number (1 through 10) of the stone within the sequence on that side of the District, the date of placement, and the words "Jurisdiction of the United States." In the twentieth century, the Daughters of the American Revolution voluntarily took responsibility for preserving the stones, which had fallen victim to vandalization and urban development.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In the late 1990s renewed interest in the boundary stones led to increased preservation efforts by the DAR and other organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.boundarystones.org|title = Boundary Stones of Washington, D.C.|website = www.boundarystones.org|access-date = 2016-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Other States ====
In 1773, a Franciscan friar named Francisco Palou erected the first boundary marker between Alta and Baja California. Commissioned by the Spanish Crown, it consisted of a cross made from alder wood and placed standing upright on a rock.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Hendry|first = George W.|date = 1926|title = Francisco Palou's Boundary Marker|journal = California Historical Society Quarterly |pages=321–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the British colonies, milestones were shipped from England to mark the Mason–Dixon line.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Boundaries of the United States and the several States: with miscellaneous geographic information concerning areas altitudes and geographic centers|last = Van Zandt|first = Franklin K.|publisher = United States Government Printing Office|year = 1976|pages = 139}}&lt;/ref&gt; A block cut from sandstone was placed at the intersection of Wyoming, Colorado and Utah in 1879,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Boundaries of the United States|last = Van Zandt|first = Franklin K.|publisher = United States Government Printing Office|year = 1976|pages = 143}}&lt;/ref&gt; and stone posts were used along the western border of South Dakota.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Boundaries of the United States|last = Van Zandt|first = Franklin K.|publisher = United States Government Printing Office|year = 1976|pages = 136}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boundaries were occasionally resurveyed and boundary stones replaced or restored, depending on their condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Boundaries of the United States|last = Van Zandt|first = Franklin K.|publisher = United States Government Printing Office|year = 1976|pages = 71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:CODIT example 4 - Auró.JPG|right|thumb|Example of Compartmentalization, with radial and circular walling, in an [[Acer platanoides]] of 5 years]]

'''Compartmentalization Of Decay In Trees''' (CODIT), also known as Compartmentalization Of Disease In Trees by some, is a concept created by [[Alex Shigo|Dr. Alex Shigo]] after years of studying tree [[wood-decay fungi|decay]] patterns.  Though disputed upon its introduction in the late 1970s, the concept is now widely accepted by modern arboriculture and is referenced widely in publications including Shigo's 'Modern Arboriculture' and 'A New Tree Biology'.

==Theoretical background==
In keeping with the theory of [[spontaneous generation]], in which living things can develop from non-living things, scientists traditionally believed that tree decay led to fungal growth. {{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}  With the advent of [[germ theory]], however, [[Germany|German]] [[forester]] [[Robert Hartig]] in the early 20th century theorized the opposite was the case, and developed a new model for [[wood-decay fungi|tree decay]]: when trees are wounded, [[fungi]] infect the wounds, and the result is decayed wood.  Over time, the research of Shigo and others helped to expand this theory, leading to the modern concept of tree decay: when trees are wounded, many organisms, not just fungi, infect the wood at different times and in different ways; trees respond to these infections with both chemical and physical changes; discolored and decayed wood results, but is limited by compartmentalization.

==Process==
[[File:CODIT Model.svg|thumb|CODIT model walls labeled]]
According to CODIT, when a tree is wounded [[Cell (biology)|cells]] undergo changes to form "walls" around the wound, slowing or preventing the spread of disease and decay to the rest of the tree.

*'''Wall 1.'''  The first wall is formed by plugging up normally conductive [[vascular tissue]] above and below the wound.  This tissue runs up and down the length of the [[Plant stem|stem]], so plugging it slows the vertical spread of decay.  Tissues are plugged in various ways, such as with [[Tylosis (Botany)|tylosis]], polyphenolic deposits, anti-fungal substances and (in conifers) by the closure of the bordered pits linking vessel cells. This wall is the weakest.
*'''Wall 2.'''  The second wall is formed by the thick-walled, lignin-rich cells of the latewood [[growth ring]] interior and exterior to the wound, thus slowing the radial spread of decay.  This wall is the second weakest, and is continuous except where intersected by ray cells (see next section).
*'''Wall 3.'''  The third wall is formed by ray cells, which are groups of radiating cells oriented perpendicularly to the stem axis, dividing the stem into segments not entirely unlike the slices of a pie.  These groups of cells are not continuous and vary in length, height and thickness, forming a [[maze]]-like barrier to tangential spread of decay.  After wounding, some ray cells are also altered chemically, becoming toxic to some microorganisms.  This is the strongest wall at the time of wounding, prior to the growth of the fourth wall.
*'''Wall 4.'''  The fourth wall, known as the '''barrier zone''', is created by new growth of specialised woody tissue on the exterior of the tree, isolating tissue present at the time of infection from subsequent growth.  This is the strongest wall, and often the only one which can completely halt the spread of infection by closing the wound with new wood.  When only the fourth wall remains intact, the result is something most people have seen walking through the woods or in a park: a living tree with a completely rotted-out interior.  In such cases, all the tissue present at the time of injury has become infected, but new healthy tissue has been allowed to continue to grow outside of the fourth wall.

==Practical impact==
By increasing understanding of how trees respond to decay, CODIT has had many applications.  For example, [[arborists]] are frequently called upon to analyze the danger posed to people or property by a damaged or decaying tree.  By knowing how decay is likely to spread, such hazard tree analyses may be more accurate, thereby preventing unnecessary [[tree removal]], property damage, or injury.  For another example, in the production of [[maple syrup]] holes are drilled into a tree's vascular tissues, which necessarily damages the tree.  CODIT has helped farmers to better understand the effects of different tapping techniques and accordingly to change their methods to minimize damage and maximize production.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070313125348/http://www.dnr.state.wi.us/org/land/forestry/Fh/fhissues/logtatum2.htm "Minimizing Wounding/Discoloration in Northern Hardwood Stands"], Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, retrieved September 18, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Work done by Gilman et al. at the [[University of Florida]] shows that a wound's proximity to leaf mass greatly influences compartmentalization as well as wound closure.

==Background==
Nivedita travelled to India in 1898. [[Josephine MacLeod]], a friend and devotee of [[Swami Vivekananda]] asked him how best she could help him and got the reply to "Love India". Nivedita wanted to interpret Indian culture to the Western world and so wrote this book.&lt;ref name="Banhatti1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=G.

The '''Damara orogeny''' was part of the [[Pan-African orogeny]]. The Damara orogeny occurred late in the creation of [[Gondwana]], at the intersection of the [[Congo Craton|Congo]] and the [[Kalahari Craton|Kalahari]] [[craton]]s.&lt;ref name="Etal"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gray|Foster|Meert|Goscombe|2008}}; {{Harvnb|Jung|Mezger|2003}}; {{Harvnb|Jung|Hoernes|Mezger|2000}}; {{Harvnb|Kukla|1993}}; {{Harvnb|Kukla|Kramm|Kukla|Okrusch|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Damara orogeny involved the [[Suture (geology)|suturing]] of the Congo–[[São Francisco Craton|São Francisco]] and [[Río de la Plata Craton|Río de la Plata]] cratons at 580–550&amp;nbsp;Ma (together with India forming northern Gondwana) before the amalgamation of the [[Kalahari Craton|Kalahari]] and [[East Antarctic Shield|Mawson]] cratons in the [[Kuunga Orogeny|Kuunga]]–Damara orogeny at 530&amp;nbsp;Ma (southern Gondwana).&lt;ref name="Gray-etal"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gray|Foster|Meert|Goscombe|2008|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Adamastor Ocean]] closed southwards from the [[Araçuaı́ Belt]] (São Francisco Craton, now in South America) to the [[Kaoko Belt]] (Congo Craton, now in Africa) 580–550&amp;nbsp;Ma and 545–530&amp;nbsp;Ma Gariep Belt (Kalahari Craton, now in southern Africa).  The Damara orogeny saw a peak in deformation and metamorphism at 530–500&amp;nbsp;Ma.  Thrusting occurred onto the Kalahari Craton until 480&amp;nbsp;Ma.&lt;ref name="Gray-etal" /&gt;

Río de la Plata docked to Congo before the closure of the Damara Belt oceans ([[Mozambique Ocean|Mozambique]] and [[Khomas Ocean|Khomas]]) which made the Damara orogeny part of the Kuunga orogeny which stretched from Antarctica to India across Africa.  All African cratons had been assembled by {{Circa}} 550&amp;nbsp;Ma and the last stages of the Damara–Kuunga Orogeny (the final amalgamation of north and South Gondwana) were intra-cratonic.&lt;ref name="Gray-etal" /&gt;

The Damara orogeny created the [[Naukluft Mountains]] in central [[Namibia]] between 550&amp;nbsp;[[Year#SI prefix multipliers|Ma]] and 495&amp;nbsp;Ma.&lt;ref name="Etal" /&gt;

The ''' Falkland Current''' (also called '''Malvinas Current''' or '''Falklands Current''') is a cold water current that flows northward along the Atlantic coast of [[Patagonia]] as far north as the mouth of the [[Río de la Plata]]. This current results from the movement of water from the [[West Wind Drift]] as it rounds [[Cape Horn]]. It takes its name from the [[Falkland Islands]] ({{lang-es|Islas Malvinas}}). This cold current mixes with the tropical [[Brazil Current]] in the [[Argentine Sea]] (see [[Brazil–Falkland Confluence]]), giving it its temperate climate.&lt;ref name="Eco"&gt;[http://www.fvsa.org.ar/situacionambiental/Mar%20Argentino.pdf Ecorregión Mar Argentino] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105114838/http://www.fvsa.org.ar/situacionambiental/Mar%20Argentino.pdf |date=November 5, 2013 }} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The current is an equatorward flowing current that carries cold and relatively fresh [[subantarctic]] water.  The Falkland Current is a branch of the [[Antarctic Circumpolar Current]].  It transports between 60 and 90 Sverdrups of water with speeds ranging from a half a meter to a meter per second.  Hydrographic data in this area is very scarce and thus various hydrographic variables have a great deal of error. The Falkland Current is not a [[surface current]] like the Brazil Current but it extends all the way to the sea-floor. Typical temperatures for the current are around 6&amp;nbsp;°C, with a salinity of 33.5–34.5&amp;nbsp;psu.&lt;ref&gt;Vivier, F. and C. Provost, 1999b: Volume transport of the Falkland Current: Can the flow be monitored by TOPEX/POSEIDON ? Journal of Geophysical Research, 104, 21105-21122.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vigan, X., C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5412">The '''geology of Romania''' is structurally complex, with evidence of past crustal movements and the incorporation of different blocks or platforms to the edge of Europe, driving recent mountain building of the Carpathian Mountains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Moores, E.M.; Fairbridge, Rhodes W.|year=1997|title=Encyclopedia of European &amp; Asian Regional Geology|publisher=Springer|p=625-631}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Romania]] is a country located at the crossroads of Central, Eastern, and Southeastern Europe. It borders the Black Sea to the southeast, Bulgaria to the south, Ukraine to the north, Hungary to the west, Serbia to the southwest, and Moldova to the east.

==Structural geology==
Geologists subdivide Romania into several structural groupings:
*'''Scythian Platform''': A platform spanning from eastern Romania to Crimea. Complex folding of Precambrian and Paleozoic basement rocks, [[slate]], [[Ordovician]] sandstone, [[Silurian]] shale, and [[Devonian]] marl and sandstone. Platform cover rocks include Devonian limestone, Triassic basic detrital rocks and carbonates, [[Jurassic]] marl and sand as well as [[Neogene]] shallow water sediments typical of the Carpathian Foreland. 
*'''Moesian Platform''': Southern part of the Carpathian Foreland, separated from the Scythian Platform by the North Dobogrea Orogen. Basement rocks are metamorphic and date to the Precambrian. It has four cycles of cover rocks, including detrital material from the Paleozoic, Triassic carbonate and shale, Jurassic-Cretaceous carbonates and [[Eocene]] calcareous and detrital rocks. 
*'''North Dobogrea Orogen''': Separated from the Moesian Platform by the Peceneaga-Camena Fault. Includes several [[nappe]] features. The orogen extends offshore into the Black Sea continental plateau

===Carpathian Orogen===
The Carpathian Orogen folded belt lies 40 percent within Romania. It includes the Main Tethyan Suture (the deformed remains of the Tethys Ocean crust) between the Foreapulian Block and the continental margin of Europe. The inner zone of the orogen was deformed during the Cretaceous, while the outer zones deformed during the Neogene. The inner zone is overlain by the Transylvanian and Pannonian basin Neogen [[molasse]] depressions and an additional molasse from the same period  overlies the outer zone. Subduction produced two calc-alkaline magmatic arcs.

==Geologic History==
The [[Pan-African orogeny]] in the late [[Proterozoic]] impacted rocks in the Carpathian Forelands. In the [[Paleozoic]], mobile areas formed south and west of the East European Platform, producing the Scythian Platform and the metamorphic rocks of the Carpathians. 

===Mesozoic (251-66 million years ago)===
Rifting began in the early [[Mesozoic]],  in the North Dobogrea-South Crimea Aulacogen, likely related to the strike-slip movement of the Tornquist-Teysseire Lineament. Ocean rifting through the [[Triassic]] separated Europe from the Preapulian Block. As the spreading of the [[Tethys Ocean]] continued, the Moesian Platform was rotated to the northwest and North Dobogrea experienced compression. The crust began to shorten and compress in the area of the Carpathian Mountains, as the Transylvanian [[nappe]] formations were obducted onto the edge of the continent. Simultaneously, the North Dobogrea orogenic belt became part of the stable [[craton]] of the Carpathian foreland.
 
===Cenozoic (66 million years ago-present)===
In the early [[Paleogene]], as the Tethys Ocean closed the Moldovian and Pienidian domain experienced [[flysch]] sedimentation and became deformed during the [[Miocene]]. Subduction of Tethys Ocean crust led to calc-alkalkine volcanism in the [[Senonian]] through the [[Paleocene]] and again in the Apuseni Mountains in the [[Neogene]]. 

The opening of the Black Sea, forced the increasingly deformed Moesian Platform to the west and [[molasse]] basins developed around the rising Carpathians in the Neogene. 

==Natural resource geology==
Some of the oldest resources in Romania are Archean-age Kyrvoirog-type iron ores in Dobogrea or others from the Paleozoic, situate in the Carpathians. Precambrian rocks also contain polymettalic copper, zinc and lead ores, gold from metamorphic rocks. Gold-silver deposited hydrothermally in the Neogene, while porphyry copper formed through the Paleocene in calc-alkaline arc of the South Carpathians and Apuseni Mountains. 

Romania has oil and gas in Moesian and Scythian platform cover, coal in Carboniferous, Jurassic, Miocene and Pliocene basins, Miocene salt deposits in the Transylvanian Depression and Carpathians, Lower Jurassic [[kaolin]] in the Apuseni Mountains, Jurassic marble, Neogen alabaster and Oligocene-age amber. {{sfn| Moores, E.M.; Fairbridge, Rhodes W.|1997|p=630}}

==History of geological research==
Geological research focused on Romania began in the early 19th century and expanded in the second half of the century led by Austrian and Hungarian geologists. L. Mrazec and I. Popescu-Voitesti wrote the first description of Carpathian structural geology in 1905. The Geological Institute of Romania was founded in 1906. In an effort to expand mining and petroleum extraction, a full mapping of the country was completed by 1958. {{sfn| Moores, E.M.; Fairbridge, Rhodes W.|1997|p=631}}

The '''Gilliss Seamount''' is a [[seamount]] in the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. It is part of the [[New England Seamounts]], which was active more than 100 million years ago. It was formed when the [[North American Plate]] moved over the [[New England hotspot]].&lt;ref name="NOAA2"&gt;{{cite web | title = Geological Origin of the New England Seamount Chain | work = National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration | publisher = U.S. Department of Commerce | year = 2005 | url = http://www.oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/explorations/03mountains/background/geology/geology.html | accessdate = 2007-09-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Glubbdubdrib''' (also spelled '''Glubdubdrib''' or '''Glubbdubdribb''' in some editions) was an island of [[Magician (fantasy)|sorcerers]] and [[Magic (illusion)|magicians]], one of the [[fictional country|imaginary countries]] visited by [[Lemuel Gulliver]] in the satire ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' by [[Anglo-Irish]] author [[Jonathan Swift]].

==Location==
The location of Glubdubdrib is illustrated in both the text and the map at the beginning of part III of ''Gulliver's Travels'', though they are not consistent with each other. 
The map shows Glubdubdrib to be southwest of the port of [[Maldonada (Gulliver's Travels)|Maldonada]] on the southwest coast of [[Luggnagg]],&lt;ref&gt;''Gulliver's Travels'' (GT), part III, ch 1: Oxford World Classic (OWC) p140&lt;/ref&gt; while the text states the island is southwest of [[Balnibarbi]], and Maldonada to be a port of that land.&lt;ref&gt;GT pt III, ch7: OWC p180&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Glubbdubdrib is about one third as large as the Isle of Wight. The inhabitants of Glubbdubdrib can wield magic, and most of their technology is utilized through magical means. The eldest in succession is prince or governor of the island. He has a 'noble' palace, and a park of about three thousand [[acre]]s, surrounded by a wall of hewn stone twenty [[foot (length)|foot]] high.&lt;ref&gt;GT pt III, ch7: OWC p180&lt;/ref&gt;

On visiting Glubbdubdrib, Gulliver had the occasion, thanks to the power of their [[necromancer]]s, to speak with [[Brutus]] of [[ancient Rome]], whom Gulliver greatly admired, among many other famous historical personages, including [[Socrates]]. Many ideas of historians were corrected this way. Gulliver spends five days doing this, then three days looking at some of the 'modern' dead, trying to find the greatest figure in the past 200 or 300 years in his country and others in Europe. Gulliver gets a new view of historians and heroes, claiming 'I was chiefly disgusted with modern History'.&lt;ref&gt;GT pt III, ch8: OWC p186&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Gold Coast (Ghana)}}
The '''Gold Coast''' was the name for a region on the [[Gulf of Guinea]] in [[West Africa]] that was rich in [[gold]] and also in [[petroleum]], [[sweet crude oil]] and [[Natural Gas|natural gas]]. It now forms the country of [[Ghana]].

== Etymology and position ==
The Gold Coast, [[Slave Coast of West Africa|Slave Coast]], [[Pepper Coast]] (or Grain Coast) and [[Ivory Coast]] were named after the main export resources there.&lt;ref name="The Legislation Providing for the Grant of Independence to Ghana"/&gt;
 
Early uses of the term Gold Coast refer literally to the coast and not the interior.&lt;ref name="The Legislation Providing for the Grant of Independence to Ghana"/&gt; It was not until the 19th century that the term came to refer to areas that are far from the coast.&lt;ref name="The Legislation Providing for the Grant of Independence to Ghana"/&gt;
 
The Gold Coast was to the east of the [[Ivory Coast]] and to the west of the [[Slave Coast of West Africa|Slave Coast]].&lt;ref name="The Legislation Providing for the Grant of Independence to Ghana"/&gt;

==Territorial entities==

Gold Coast region [[territorial entities]] were:
*[[Portuguese Gold Coast]] ([[Portuguese people|Portuguese]])
*[[Brandenburger Gold Coast]] and [[Prussian Gold Coast]] ([[Germans]])
*[[Swedish Gold Coast]] ([[Swedes]])
*[[Danish Gold Coast]] ([[Denmark-Norway]])
*[[Dutch Gold Coast]] ([[Dutch people|Dutch]])
*[[British Gold Coast]] ([[English people|English]])

''[[Ghana]]'' is the legal name for the Gold Coast region comprising the following four separate parts, which immediately before independence enjoyed distinct constitutional positions:&lt;ref name="The Legislation Providing for the Grant of Independence to Ghana"&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/745294?uid=3739776&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21103144062447 "The Legislation Providing for the Grant of Independence to Ghana"], ''Journal of African Law'', Vol. 1, No. 2 (Summer, 1957, pp. 99–112, Published by Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Gold Coast (region): [[Akan people|Akans]], [[Danes]], [[Dutch people|Dutch]], [[English people|English]], [[Germans]], [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]], and [[Swedes]];
* [[Kingdom of Ashanti]] ([[Akan people|Akans]]: [[Ashanti Region|Ashanti]], [[Brong-Ahafo Region|Brong-Ahafo]], [[Central Region (Ghana)|Central]], [[Eastern Region (Ghana)|Eastern]], [[Greater Accra Region|Greater Accra]], and [[Western Region (Ghana)|Western]]);
* the [[Kingdom of Dagbon (Northern Territories)|Protectorate of the Northern Territories]] ([[Upper West Region|Upper West]], [[Upper East Region|Upper East]], and [[Northern Region (Ghana)|Northern]]); and
* the [[British Togoland|Trust Territory of Togoland (under British administration)]]: [[Volta Region|Volta]].
The Gold Coast [[Governor-General of Ghana|Governors-General]] responsible for shepherding through the Gold Coast independence legislation [[Charles Arden-Clarke]] [[William Hare, 5th Earl of Listowel|Lord Listowel]] explained that the name was.chosen "in accordance with the wishes of the Gold Coastian population".&lt;ref&gt;HC Deb, 11 December 1956, vol. 562 cc229-326, Ghana Independence Bill, The Under-Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations (Lord John Hope) "First, there is the name "Ghana." This has been conferred on the new country in accordance with local wishes. It was the name of an ancient kingdom, in what is now French territory south of the Sahara, which has acquired great historic significance in the Gold Coast."&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Stamp Gold Coast Golden Stool with GeorgeVI.jpg|thumb|left|1930s Stamp Gold Coast Golden Stool with [[George VI]].]]
Europeans reached this region of Africa in 1482, and for centuries afterwards, various European empires and trading companies set up [[Factory (trading post)|trading posts, known as factories]] there. They used these colonies [[exploitation colonialism|to exploit the resources]] rather than [[settler colonialism|to settle large numbers of subjects]]. 

The [[Portuguese Gold Coast]] was the first claim.&lt;ref name="The Legislation Providing for the Grant of Independence to Ghana"/&gt; The Dutch arrived in 1598 and in 1642 incorporated the Portuguese territory into the [[Dutch Gold Coast]].&lt;ref name="The Legislation Providing for the Grant of Independence to Ghana"/&gt; The Dutch stayed in the region until 1871, when the last of their settlements were taken over by the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|British Gold Coast]].&lt;ref name="The Legislation Providing for the Grant of Independence to Ghana"/&gt;

There was also the [[Brandenburger Gold Coast]], which established a colony in the area in 1682.&lt;ref name="The Legislation Providing for the Grant of Independence to Ghana"/&gt; It later became the Prussian Gold Coast.&lt;ref name="The Legislation Providing for the Grant of Independence to Ghana"/&gt; In 1721 the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] purchased it.&lt;ref name="The Legislation Providing for the Grant of Independence to Ghana"/&gt; The [[Swedish Gold Coast]] settlements date to 1650. The Danes arrived in 1663 and later seized the Swedish territorty and incorporated it into the [[Danish Gold Coast]].&lt;ref name="The Legislation Providing for the Grant of Independence to Ghana"/&gt; &lt;ref name="The Legislation Providing for the Grant of Independence to Ghana"/&gt; In 1850 all of the settlements became part of the British Gold Coast.&lt;ref name="The Legislation Providing for the Grant of Independence to Ghana"/&gt;

In 1774 [[Malachy Postlethwayt|a London commercial expert]] references a witness that "the king of Guinea, the greatest city in all the countries of Negroland, has a mass of gold of thirty pounds weight as it was naturally produced in the mines which is completely pure, tough and malleable without having been smelted".&lt;ref&gt;Postlethwayt, Malachy (1774). ''Universal Dictionary of Trade and Commerce'' (4th edition). London: W. Strahan, J. &amp; F. Rivington. Volume 1. "Africa".&lt;/ref&gt; The British had taken over all of Gold Coast by 1871.&lt;ref name="The Legislation Providing for the Grant of Independence to Ghana"/&gt; They captured more territory inland in the late 19th century after the [[Anglo-Ashanti wars]].&lt;ref name="The Legislation Providing for the Grant of Independence to Ghana"/&gt;  In 1957, the territory of Gold Coast was granted independence as [[Ghana]].&lt;ref name="The Legislation Providing for the Grant of Independence to Ghana"/&gt;

'''Thomas Gordon Cullen''' (9 August 1914 – 11 August 1994) was an influential British [[architect]] and urban designer who was a key motivator in the [[Townscape]] movement. He is best known for the book ''Townscape'', first published in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lccn.loc.gov/61016682|title=Library of Congress LCCN Permalink 61016682|website=Lccn.loc.gov|accessdate=3 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later editions of ''Townscape '' were published under the title ''The Concise Townscape''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lccn.loc.gov/73161799 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120710185037/http://lccn.loc.gov/73161799 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-10 |title=Library of Congress LCCN Permalink 73161799 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2014}}
Cullen was born in [[Calverley]], Pudsey, near [[Leeds]], Yorkshire, England. He studied architecture at the [[University of Westminster|Royal Polytechnic Institution]], the present day University of Westminster, and subsequently worked as a draughtsman in various architects' offices including that of [[Berthold Lubetkin]] and [[Tecton]], but he never qualified or practised as an architect.

Between 1944 and 1946 he worked in the planning office of the Development and Welfare Department in [[Barbados]], as his poor eyesight meant that he was unfit to serve in the British armed forces. He later returned to London and joined the ''[[Architectural Review]]'' journal, first as a draughtsman and then as a writer on planning policies. There he produced a large number of influential editorials and case studies on the theory of planning and the design of towns. Many improvements in the urban and rural environment in Britain during the 1950s and 1960s. He was also involved in the [[Festival of Britain]] in 1951. One of the few large scale Cullen works on public display is the mural in the foyer of the [[Erno Goldfinger]] designed [[Greenside School|Greenside Primary School]] in west London, completed in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greenside.lbhf.sch.uk/ourschool |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-09-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925113131/http://www.greenside.lbhf.sch.uk/ourschool |archivedate=25 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; His 1958 ceramic mural in Coventry, depicting the history of the City and its post-war regeneration, is on a much grander scale though now relocated away from its original central location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.c20society.org.uk/murals-campaign/11-gordon-cullen-ceramic-tile-mural-1958/|title=11 Gordon Cullen, Ceramic Tile Mural, 1958 — The Twentieth Century Society|website=C20society.org.uk|accessdate=3 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His techniques consisted largely of sketchy drawings that conveyed a particularly clear understanding of his ideas, and these had a considerable influence on subsequent architectural illustration styles. He also illustrated several books by other various authors, before writing his own book - based on the idea of Townscape - in 1961. '''The Concise Townscape''' has subsequently been republished around 15 times, proving to be one of the most popular books on Urban Design in the 20th Century.

In 1956 Cullen became a freelance writer and consultant and, in the years immediately following he advised the cities of [[Liverpool]] and [[Peterborough]] on their reconstruction and redevelopment plans. In 1960 he was invited to [[India]] to advise on the planning aspects of the [[Ford Foundation]]'s work in [[New Delhi]] and [[Calcutta]] and so in 1962 he and his family lived in India for 6 months while he worked on the projects. Later, his work included planning advice to the city of [[Glasgow]] and during the 1980s the [[London Docklands Development Corporation]].

For a while Cullen teamed up with a student, David Price, and they formed an architectural firm together - Price &amp; Cullen. They won a competition in London in the 1980s and together designed and oversaw the building of the [[Swedish Quays]] housing development in Docklands. They worked together until 1990 as Price's first child was born and because Cullen's health was deteriorating. Price died in 2009 at the age of 53.

Cullen lived in the small village of [[Wraysbury]] (Berkshire) from 1958 until his death, aged 80, on 11 August 1994, following a serious stroke. After his passing, David Gosling and [[Norman Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank|Norman Foster]] collected various examples of his work and put them together in the book "Visions of Urban Design".

== Awards ==
In 1972 he was elected Honorary Fellow of the [[RIBA]]. In 1975 he was awarded with an [[Royal Designers for Industry|RDI]] for illustration and Townscape. The following year he was awarded a medal from [[The American Institute of Architects]]. In 1978 he was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire|CBE]] for his contribution to architecture from [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom]].

'''Greater Helsinki''' ({{lang-fi|Helsingin seutu, Suur-Helsinki}}, [[Finland-Swedish|Swedish]]: ''Helsingforsregionen'', ''Storhelsingfors'') is the [[metropolitan area]] including  the smaller '''Capital Region''' (''Pääkaupunkiseutu'', ''Huvudstadsregionen'') [[urban area|urban kernel]] and [[commuter town]]s surrounding [[Helsinki]], the [[capital city]] of [[Finland]]. Greater Helsinki is sometimes incorrectly{{clarification needed|date=June 2018}} called (the) ''Helsinki Region'' due to an incorrect direct translation of the Finnish and Swedish terms ''Helsingin seutu'' and ''Helsingforsregionen''. It is part of [[Uusimaa]] province.

These regions are located in the south of Finland, on the coast of the [[Gulf of Finland]], which is part of the [[Baltic Sea]]. The smaller Capital Region includes Helsinki, [[Vantaa]], [[Espoo]], and [[Kauniainen]] and has a population of over 1.1 million. The Greater Helsinki region is the largest [[urbanised]] area in the country with 1,420,284&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.helsinginseutu.fi/hki/HS/The+Region+of+Helsinki/City+information+and+statistics|title=City information and statistics|website=www.helsinginseutu.fi|access-date=2016-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; inhabitants and is by far the most important economic, cultural, and scientific region of Finland. Five out of Finland's 15 [[List of universities in Finland|universities]]&lt;ref group="note"&gt;These are Aalto University, University of Helsinki, University of the Arts Helsinki, Hanken School of Economics, National Defence University.&lt;/ref&gt; and most of the headquarters of notable companies and governmental institutions are located in Greater Helsinki, as is Finland's main [[airline hub]] and [[airport]], [[Helsinki Airport]], which is located in [[Vantaa]].

==Terminology==

In the strictest sense, the Finnish Capital Region consists of four [[Municipalities of Finland|municipalities]] with city status, [[Helsinki]], [[Vantaa]], [[Espoo]] and [[Kauniainen]], whose total population is about 1.1 million (2014). This area is most often called the ''Capital region'' in English, ''Pääkaupunkiseutu'' in Finnish, and ''Huvudstadsregionen'' in Swedish, although the use of the terms is not especially consistent. The vast majority of the inhabitants live in the [[urban areas]] of the cities, but within the boundaries of these cities there are also [[suburb|suburban]] and [[rural area|rural areas]].

Commonly about ten more municipalities are considered to be part of Greater Helsinki, as they can be considered to be [[commuter town]]s and [[exurb]]s of Helsinki. When [[Hyvinkää]], [[Järvenpää]], [[Kerava]], [[Kirkkonummi]], [[Nurmijärvi]], [[Sipoo]], [[Tuusula]], [[Mäntsälä]], [[Pornainen]] and [[Vihti]] are included, the number of inhabitants rises to 1.4  million. All of the municipalities belong to the [[Regions of Finland|region]] of [[Uusimaa (region)|Uusimaa]]. Of these, [[Järvenpää]], [[Kerava]], [[Tuusula]], [[Nurmijärvi]], [[Sipoo]], [[Kirkkonummi]], [[Mäntsälä]] and [[Vihti]] have parts of the urban area within them. Additionally, the cities of [[Porvoo]], [[Lohja]], and to some extent [[Riihimäki]], which have very close ties, motorway and (in the case of [[Riihimäki]]) commuter train accesses, and are fairly close to the capital, are nowadays often included in regional planning, which raises the total population to about 1,550,000.

As a part of "Urban audit" project the Eurostat has attempted to standardise the concept of 'metropolitan area'. According to this study the Metropolitan area of Helsinki consists of the kernel of Helsinki: Helsinki, Espoo, Vantaa, and Kauniainen. Helsinki Larger Urban Area (Helsingin seutu in Finnish) consists of 12 cities and municipalities: the kernel of Helsinki and the aforementioned eight municipalities.&lt;ref&gt;http://circa.europa.eu/Public/irc/dsis/urbstat/library?l=/urban_audit_reports/urban_audit_2006/final_reportpdf_18/_EN_1.0_&amp;a=d{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Statistics Finland]] define the [[commuter belt]] of Helsinki (''Helsingin työssäkäyntialue'', ''Helsingfors pendlingsområde'') to include a total of 24 municipalities, with a land area of 7,359.80&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a population of 1,431,108 as of 31 December 2007.&lt;ref name="StatFinComm2007"&gt;[http://pxweb2.stat.fi/Dialog/Varvalagg.asp?ma=010%5Fvaerak%5Ftau%5F123%5Fsv&amp;ti=Folkm%E4ngd+efter+k%F6n+och+omr%E5de+samt+f%F6r%E4ndringen+av+folkm%E4ngden+31%2E12%2E2007&amp;path=../Database/StatFin/vrm/vaerak/&amp;lang=2&amp;xu=&amp;yp=&amp;nr=1&amp;aggfile(1)=%2D+Pendlingsomr%E5der+och+kommuner+2008&amp;prevagg=NNN&amp;mapname=&amp;multilang=sv Statistics Finland; Population by sex, area and change of population 31.12.2007; Commuter belts and municipalities 2008] {{dead link|date=December 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}} In Swedish, table unavailable in English.

==Statistics==

The table below lists [[population]], [[area]], and [[population density]] for the largest municipalities of the Greater Helsinki area. (Note that "Helsinki Metropolitan Area" and the other terms used are not firmly established and may vary in different contexts.) The commuter towns of [[Lohja]] and [[Porvoo]] are not usually included, though, if they were (considering their proximity to Helsinki and their high commuting rate), they would raise the overall population to nearly 1.5 million people.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4082">'''ISO 3166-2:BH''' is the entry for [[Bahrain]] in [[ISO 3166-2]], part of the [[ISO 3166]] [[standardization|standard]] published by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), which defines [[code]]s for the names of the principal [[country subdivision|subdivision]]s (e.g., [[province]]s or [[state (administrative division)|state]]s) of all [[country|countries]] coded in [[ISO 3166-1]].

Currently for Bahrain, ISO 3166-2 codes are defined for [[governorates of Bahrain|4 governorates]]. Each code consists of two parts, separated by a hyphen. The first part is {{mono|BH}}, the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] code of Bahrain. The second part is two digits (13&amp;ndash;17, with the exception of 16, which was assigned to [[Al Wusţá Governorate (Bahrain)|Al Wusţá]] before its abolition in 2014).

==Current codes==
Subdivision names are listed as in the ISO 3166-2 standard published by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6080">'''Jan of Stobnica''' (ca. 1470 - 1530), was a [[Poles|Polish]] [[philosopher]], [[scientist]] and [[geographer]] of the early 16th century.

==Life==
Jan of Stobnica was educated at the [[Jagiellonian University]] (Kraków Academy), where he taught as professor between 1498 and 1514. He is the author of numerous works on the subjects of [[logic]], [[grammar]], [[astronomy]], [[geography]], [[mathematics]], [[music]], [[natural science]]s, and [[ethics]].

[[File:Mapa Stobnica 1512a.jpg|thumb|Map of the two Americas from ''Cosmography of Ptolemy'' by Jan of Stobnica, 1512]]
Jan of Stobnica was one of Kraków's adherents of [[Scotism]], a philosophical school brought in from [[Paris]] first by [[Michał Twaróg of Bystrzyków]] (ca. 1450 - 1520). Jan of Stobnica became Michał's most prominent student.&lt;ref&gt;[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]], ''Zarys dziejów filozofii w Polsce'' (A Brief History of Philosophy in Poland), [in the series:] Historia nauki polskiej w monografiach (''History of Polish Learning in Monographs''), [volume] XXXII, Kraków, Polska Akademia Umiejętności ([[Polish Academy of Learning]]), 1948, pp. 6–7. This monograph draws from pertinent sections in earlier editions of the author's ''Historia filozofii'' (History of Philosophy).&lt;/ref&gt; Jan's most famous work, entitled ''"Introductio in Ptholomei Cosmographiam"'' (''Introduction to the Cosmography of Ptolemy'') featured some of the first maps printed in Poland. Likewise, his edition of [[Ptolemy]] first contained a map of North and South America showing the connection of the two continents by an [[isthmus]]. It is one of the oldest known references to North America with the Gulf of Mexico delimited by the peninsula of Florida, peculiarly labeled "Isa-bella" (see engraving), which corresponds to the name of Cuba in primitive times, which in fact he left it blank.&lt;ref&gt;[[Piotr Stefan Wandycz]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=_XaFaNshCrkC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;dq=%22Jan+of+Stobnica%22#PPA33,M1  ''The United States and Poland''], Harvard University Press, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; ''"Cosmographiam"'' by Jan of Stobnica, from 1512, are among some of the most precious [[Polonica]] of the [[New York Public Library]] holdings.

== Works ==
Stonbica authored a number of works on logic, grammar, astronomy, geography, mathematics, music, natural science, ethics, and theology.

=== As author ===
* ''Parvulus philosophiae naturalis''. Kraków, [[Caspar Hochfeder|drukarnia K. Hochfeder]], 1503; Kraków, 1507; Kraków, 1513; Basel, 1516; Kraków, 1517.

This is a '''list of [[United States National Park]]s by [[altitude|elevation]]'''. Most of America's national parks are located in mountainous areas. Even among those located close to the ocean, not all are flat. Those few that are low-lying preserve important natural habitats that could never exist at high altitude. Several national parks protect deep [[canyon]]s with great vertical relief. There are also three national parks whose primary features are caves, the depths of which are still being explored.

==Highest and lowest points in each US National Park==
''Criteria:'' Points on this list are the highest and lowest points within each [[National Park Service#National Parks|national park]] and its associated [[national preserve]], if it has one. It does not include adjacent or associated [[national recreation area]]s, [[List of areas in the United States National Park System#Parkways|parkways]], [[List of areas in the United States National Park System#National memorials|memorials]], or [[United States National Forest|forests]], but does include [[inholding|private property]] within park boundaries. Footnotes are given to mention other notable high or low points, when appropriate.

==Centers of the states and Washington, DC==
The list given below has been only slightly modified since it was first produced by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) in the early 1920s.&lt;ref&gt; Douglas, E.M. 1923. Boundaries, Areas, Geographic Centers, and Altitudes of the United States and Several States. Bulletin 689. U.S. Geological Survey, Washington, DC. &lt;/ref&gt; At that time, the center for a state was found by suspending a cardboard cutout of the state by a string, and then drawing a vertical line from the suspension point. After rotating the cutout 90 degrees and drawing another vertical line from the new suspension point, the intersection of the two vertical lines was used as the geographic center.&lt;ref&gt;  Adams, Oscar, S. 1932. Geographical Centers.  The Military Engineer 24, 138: 586-587.&lt;/ref&gt; The result is dependent upon the type of projection used.

== Updated list of geographic centers == 
Although there have been different definitions offered for the geographic center, an intuitive one, and one used by the USGS, is "the center of gravity of the surface, or that point on which the surface of the area would balance if it were a plane of uniform thickness."&lt;ref&gt; Van Zandt, Franklin. 1966. Boundaries of the United States and the Several States. Bulletin 1212. U.S. Geological Survey, Washington, DC. &lt;/ref&gt; An updated list of geographic centers using this definition (which is equivalent to the state's centroid) is given below.  It was derived by minimizing the sum of squared great circle distances from all points of land in a state (including islands, but not coastal waters, following the earlier practice of the USGS). It represents a slight improvement over the list originally published &lt;ref&gt; Rogerson, P. 2015. A New Method for Finding Geographic Centers, with Application to the U.S. States.  The Professional Geographer. Published online Aug 15, 2015; DOI:10.1080/00330124.2015.1062707 http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00330124.2015.1062707#.Vd30QflVhBc Retrieved 2015-08-26 &lt;/ref&gt;

The geographic center of the contiguous United States, determined in this way, is at (39.8000 N, 99.1086 W); this is 2.7 miles from Agra, Kansas, 4.7 miles from Kensington, Kansas, and 27.9 great circle miles west of the longstanding designated center of Lebanon, Kansas.

==[[Border|Boundaries]]==
Below are separate lists of [[countries]] and [[Dependent territory|dependencies]] with their land boundaries, and lists of which countries and dependencies border [[oceans]] and major [[sea]]s.  The first short section describes the borders or edges of [[continents]] and oceans/major seas.  Disputed areas are not considered.

===[[Continent]]s===
''(Notes: Dependencies and islands remote from continental land masses{{vague|date=October 2018}} are not considered and are '''excluded''' from this list section; thus only continental land borders are considered.   The only countries listed either straddle continents or are on a continent border.)''

      <comment>For the umpteenth time, it is not NPOV to group the State of Palestine as a generally recognized sovereign state; it was rejected for full membership by the UN is not recognized by any of the G7 nor by most other major economies. Palestine should be classified along with Taiwan as states with substantial, but limited, international recognition.  You have agreed to this on many occasions, but then go back on your word.  If you've changed your mind, please discuss in the Talk page.</comment>

This is a '''list of sovereign states and dependent territories in Asia'''. It includes both [[sovereign state|fully recognized states]], states with limited recognition, and [[dependent territory|dependent territories]] of both [[Asia]]n and non-Asian states.  It lists [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories in Asia#Sovereign states|49 generally recognized sovereign states]] (all of which are members of the [[United Nations]]), two states with substantial, but not general, international recognition (of which one is a UN observer state), four largely unrecognized de-facto states, and [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories in Asia#Dependent territories and other territories|six dependent territories and other territories]]. 

The 49 generally recognized sovereign states listed herein include two countries that generally are classified as European or African nations but with portions of their territory being in Asia, while the two substantially but not generally recognized states are both fully encompassed in Asia.  While most of [[Russia]]'s area is in Asia, it generally is classified as a European country because its capital ([[Moscow]]) and most of its population is in [[Europe]].  In addition, while [[Egypt]] extends into Asia through the [[Sinai Peninsula]], it generally is considered an [[Africa]]n country because most of its population and geographic area is in Africa.

==Geographical boundaries of Asia==
The divisions between [[Asia]] and [[Europe]] occur at the [[Ural Mountains]], [[Ural River]], and [[Caspian Sea]] in the east, the [[Caucasus Mountains]] and the [[Black Sea]] with its outlets, [[Bosporus]] and [[Dardanelles]] in the south. [[Azerbaijan]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Russia]], and [[Turkey]] all have territory in both Asia and Europe. [[Armenia]] and [[Cyprus]] are entirely in [[Western Asia]] but are socio-politically European countries and members of the [[Council of Europe]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

The division between Asia and [[Africa]] is usually considered to be the [[Suez Canal]], placing the [[Sinai peninsula]] in Asia, and therefore Egypt may be included as an Asian state.

The division between Asia and [[Australasia]] ([[Oceania]]) is disputed, and placed somewhere between [[Java]] and [[New Guinea]]. [[Indonesia]] spans both areas, but is considered to be Asian. [[East Timor]] is sometimes considered to be part of [[Australasia]], but due to its being surrounded by Indonesia and its once being part of Indonesia, it is considered Asian. [[Papua New Guinea]] is occasionally considered Asian by virtue of neighbouring Indonesia, but this is rare, and it is generally accepted to be part of [[Australasia]]. The division between Asia and [[North America]] is considered to be the [[Bering Strait]]. Some of the [[Aleutian Islands]] may be considered as Asian. {{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

==Sovereign states==
{{further|Sovereign state}}
A sovereign state is a political association with effective [[sovereignty]] over a population for whom it makes decisions in the national interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

===States with limited, but substantial, international recognition===

In this list, one is a state with substantial and somewhat widespread international recognition, and UN observer-state status, but without practical control over tangible territory, while the other is a de facto state with full practical sovereignty over its territory and unofficial ties with much of the international community but is not widely recognized ''de jure'' and, as of 1971, is no longer recognized by the United Nations.

The '''list of uninhabited regions''' includes a number of places around the globe. The list changes year over year as human beings migrate into formerly uninhabited regions, or migrate out of formerly inhabited regions.

==List==
As a group, the list of uninhabited places are called the "nonecumene".  This is a special geography term which means the uninhabited area of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Gosh, Ajay Kumar. (2005).

{{distinguish|text=the [[Nazi]] purge known as the [[Night of the Long Knives (1934)]]}}
'''Long knives''' or '''big knives''' was a term used by the [[Iroquois]], and later by the [[Mingo]] and other [[North American Indians|Natives]] of the [[Ohio Country]] to designate British colonists of [[Virginia]], in contradistinction to those of [[New York State|New York]] and [[Pennsylvania]].

It is a literal translation of the treaty name that the Iroquois first bestowed on Virginia Governor [[Francis Howard, 5th Baron Howard of Effingham|Lord Howard]] in 1684, ''Assarigoe'' (variously spelled ''Assaregoa, Assaragoa, Asharigoua''), meaning "[[cutlass]]" in Onondaga.  This word was chosen as a pun on Howard's name, which sounds like Dutch ''hower'' meaning "cutlass"&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=MZurlZfg1fAC&amp;pg=PA141&amp;dq=hower+cutlass&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiI8IuV5O3NAhUERiYKHR2OAp44FBDoAQhLMAk#v=onepage&amp;q=hower%20cutlass contemporary 17th c. source affirming Dutch ''hower'' = "cutlass"]&lt;/ref&gt; (similar to the Iroquois' choice of the name ''Onas'', or "quill pen", for the Pennsylvania Governors, beginning with William Penn.) This is the very explanation included within official diplomatic correspondence addressed by the Iroquois sachems themselves to then-governor Spotswood in 1722. &lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8DJEAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA251&amp;dq=hower+cutlass&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiI8IuV5O3NAhUERiYKHR2OAp44FBDoAQg2MAU#v=onepage&amp;q=hower%20cutlass Iroquois-Virginia negotiations of 1722] - (note the date 1784 is incorrectly printed here for 1684).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Rogers Clark]] spoke of himself and men as "Big Knives" or Virginians, in his speeches to the Indians in 1778 after the [[Battle of Vincennes|capture of Illinois]]. In the latter part of the [[American Revolutionary War]], down to and during the [[War of 1812]], the term was used to designate "Americans".

'''Lower Kolašin''' ([[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]] and {{lang-sr-cyr|Доњи Колашин/Donji Kolašin}}) is a historical region&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Гласник Етнографског института|volume=22-24|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4oQjAQAAIAAJ|year=1973|publisher=Научно дело|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the present-day municipality of [[Bijelo Polje]] in northern [[Montenegro]], towards [[Serbia]]. It is situated in the picturesque Vraneš valley formed around the river [[Ljuboviđa]]. The most important local populated centers are [[Tomaševo]] and [[Pavino Polje]].

==Geography==
Lower Kolašin is a region situated in the northern part of Montenegro, at the border with Serbia. It is located between the rivers of [[Tara (river)|Tara]], [[Ljuboviđa]], left tributary of [[Lim (river)|Lim river]] and source of the Ćeotina.&lt;ref name="Marković1967"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jovan Đ Marković|title=Geografske oblasti Socijalističke Federativne Republike Jugoslavije|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QlwMAQAAIAAJ|year=1967|publisher=Zavod za izdavanje udžbenika Socijalističke Republike Srbije|quote=Крај око Мојковца познат је као Горњи Колашин.

==History==
===Middle Ages===
The Ljuboviđa ''[[župa]]'' (county) was mentioned in medieval documents beginning in 1281. It was named after a river that passed through the Vraneš valley. The county included an area from the [[Tara (river)|Tara]] in the west, beyond the Lim to the east, from [[Brodarevo]] in the north to south of [[Mojkovac]].{{cn|date=January 2016}}

The [[Ottoman Empire]] first established its rule in the region in 1396, and managed to occupy the entire area by 1463–65, making it part of the [[Sanjak of Herzegovina]].{{cn|date=January 2016}} The first Ottoman censuses from 1468 and 1477 reveal that the local administrator at that time was one Herak Vraneš, a native.{{cn|date=January 2016}}

===19th century===
According to the [[Treaty of San Stefano]] (3 March 1878), the region was to be ceded to the [[Principality of Montenegro]], however, it was never implemented. With the [[Congress of Berlin]] (13 July 1878), the Austro-Hungarians obtained the right to station garrisons in the [[Sanjak of Novi Pazar]]. In 1880, the [[Sanjak of Sjenica]] (the new Sanjak of Novi Pazar) was established, which included the ''[[kaza]]'' (districts) of [[Sjenica]] (its seat), [[Nova Varoš]], [[Bijelo Polje]] and Lower Kolašin (part of modern [[Bijelo Polje]] and [[Mojkovac]] municipalities).&lt;ref name="Petrović1995-8"&gt;{{cite book|author=Milić F. Petrović|title=Dokumenti o Raškoj oblasti: 1900-1912|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L1K5AAAAIAAJ|year=1995|publisher=Arhiv Srbije|page=8|quote=Да би сузбила аустроугарски утицај у западним крајевима Рашке области, Турска је извршила нову управну поделу.

Потом је 1880. године основан пљеваљ- ски санџак — мутесарифлук тј. округ саседиштем у Пљевљима, који је обухватио казе Пљевља, Пријеноље и мундирлук - испоставу у Прибоју.

In 1886, Lower Kolašin was ceded to Montenegro. That same year, all Muslim families emigrated to Turkey. The abandoned land was settled by rebels from this area and neighbouring ones, by Prince [[Nikola I Petrović-Njegoš]].&lt;ref name="Bulajić1959"&gt;{{cite book|author=Žarko Bulajić|title=Agrarni odnosi u Crnoj Gori, 1878-1912|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MWjJAAAAMAAJ|year=1959|publisher=Grafički Zavod|quote=Поља Колашинска, или Доњи Колашин, ослобођена су тек 1886 године.19): Исте године су и све муслиманске породице еми- грирале у Турску.

===20th century===
In 1912, during the [[First Balkan War]], [[Montenegro]] occupied Lower Kolašin on 12 October 1912, imposing a rule of terror and fear over the local Muslim population.{{cn|date=January 2016}} Shortly thereafter, the three local municipalities were formed in Lower Kolašin with centers in [[Tomaševo]], [[Pavino Polje]], and [[Stozer]]. Mass killings of local Muslim population led to their widespread migration to [[Turkey]].

After the local Montenegrin administrator, [[Boško Bošković]] was murdered near [[Obod]] by his countrymen, the Montenegrin nationalists used that as an excuse to blame a local Muslim, [[Jusuf Mehonić]], for the murder, which would open a way for the complete expulsion of Muslims from Lower Kolašin. On 9–10 November 1924, armed hordes of Montenegrin peasants massacred up to 600–700 Muslims in Lower Kolašin, committing the most atrocious crimes. Following this event, all surviving Muslims left Lower Kolašin, relocating to other parts of [[Sandžak]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] or [[Turkey]]. One family converted to Orthodox Christianity, saving itself from physical extermination.{{cn|date=January 2016}}

==Demographics==
The present-day population of Lower Kolašin is 4,300, all [[Serbs]] and [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrins]].

Prior to the massacre in 1924, according to the census in 1912, Lower Kolašin had 14,838 inhabitants, with the following ethnic distribution:

* Mojkovac municipality: Muslims 1,581, Serbs 1,293
* Ravna Rijeka municipality: Muslims 2,003, Serbs 679
* Stozer municipality: Muslims 1,160, Serbs 1,971
* Pavino Polje municipality: Muslims 3,230, Serbs 641;
* Tomaševo municipality: Muslims 2,132, Serbs 119

In percentages, the overall breakdown is:
* Muslims: 10,106 or 68.1%
* [[Serbs]]: 4,703 or 31.7%

'''Marcel Dubois''' (25 July 1856 – 23 October 1916) was a French geographer. He was a co-founder of the ''[[Annales de Géographie]]'', a journal of academic geography.

==Early years==

Marcel Dubois was born in Paris on 25 July 1856.{{sfn|Marcel Dubois – BnF}}
He attended the [[École normale supérieure]] at rue d'Ulm, Paris, from 1876.
His schoolmates included the future geographers [[Bertrand Auerbach]] and [[Paul Dupuy]], and the future historians [[Georges Lacour-Gayet]],  [[Salomon Reinach]] and [[Gustave Lanson]].
After graduating, he travelled to Athens in 1880, probably via Rome.
He travel through Greece and the [[Aegean Islands]] and examined and copied many inscriptions, which were published in the ''bulletin de correspondence hellénique'' between 1880 and 1884.
Dubois returned to France in the fall of 1882 with the material for his thesis on the island of [[Kos]].{{sfn|Ginsburger|2017}}

Dubois's first post was at the Faculty of Arts at the [[University of Nancy]], which he joined in 1882 to teach ancient history.
He joined the local geographical society, and from February 1884 to October 1885 was a lecturer in both history and geography.
He then replaced [[Alfred Nicolas Rambaud]] as professor of history and geography, despite not yet having his doctorate, which he presented on 3 November 1884.
In the summer of 1884 Dubois visited the coast of Asia Minor, and went on to the Mediterranean coast of Libya and Egypt.{{sfn|Ginsburger|2017}}

==University of Paris==

On 13 October 1883 Dubois became a lecturer in Geography at the Faculty of Letters, University of Paris.
The geography section at the Sorbonne was inaugurated at the start of the 1891 academic year.
In 1891 Dubois and [[Paul Vidal de La Blache]] founded the ''Annales de Géographie'', a journal.
A chair of colonial geography was finally established at the University of Paris on 16 May 1893, with Dubois as first professor, a position he held until his death.
In 1895 Dubois was appointed to the advisory committee of public instruction of the colonies, and was made a knight of the [[Legion of Honour]].
Dubois broke with La Blache and stopped contributing to the ''Annales''. in 1895.{{sfn|Ginsburger|2017}}

The [[Ligue de la patrie française]] originated in 1898 with three young academics, [[Louis Dausset]], [[Gabriel Syveton]] and [[Henri Vaugeois]], who wanted to show that Dreyfusism was not accepted by all at the University.{{sfn|Pierrard|1998|p=180}}
They launched a petition that attacked [[Émile Zola]] and what many saw as an internationalist, pacifist left-wing conspiracy.{{sfn|Conner|2014|p=160}}
[[Charles Maurras]] gained the interest of the writer [[Maurice Barrès]], and the movement gained the support of three eminent personalities: the geographer Marcel Dubois, the poet [[François Coppée]] and the critic and literature professor [[Jules Lemaître]].{{sfn|Pierrard|1998|p=180}}

Marcel Dubois died in [[Romilly-sur-Andelle]], Eure, on 23 October 1916.{{sfn|Marcel Dubois – BnF}}

The '''Minister-President of the Brussels Capital-Region''' ({{lang-fr|Région de Bruxelles-Capitale}}, {{lang-nl|Brussels Hoofdstedelijk Gewest}}) is the person leading the [[Government of the Brussels-Capital Region]].&lt;ref name="Belgian Constitution"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Belgian Constitution (English version) |url=http://www.dekamer.be/kvvcr/pdf_sections/publications/constitution/grondwetEN.pdf |format=[[PDF]] |publisher=Belgian House of Representatives |date=January 2009 |accessdate=2009-06-05 |quote=Article 3: Belgium comprises three Regions: the Flemish Region, the Walloon Region and the Brussels region.

While being the leader of the Government, the Minister-President also is the president of the College of the [[Common Community Commission]] of Brussels.

The Minister-President of the Brussels-Capital Region should neither be confused with the [[Governor of Brussels-Capital]] nor with the [[mayor]] of the [[City of Brussels]], which is one of the [[Municipalities of the Brussels-Capital Region|19 municipalities of Brussels]].

The Minister-President is not counted in the ratio of French-speaking to Dutch-speaking ministers.  In practice every Minister-President has been a francophone, though bilingual.

'''Planet Lofoten''' is a [[Land Art]] Installation of the [[solar system]] positioned in the open nature of West [[Lofoten]] in Northern [[Norway]].

The [[Planets]] are made from [[stone]] and range in size from Jupiter at several hundred kilograms to [[Pluto]] at only a few grams, and ranges within an area of 30&amp;nbsp;km from [[Reine]] at [[Moskenes]] Island to Nordland at [[Værøy]] Island. The [[Sun]] is still in the construction process&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nfi.no/english/norwegianfilms/show.html?id=752 ''The Norwegian filminstitute''] Quote to Jan Wangaard in the documentary film "Alt Flyter (Panta Rei)."&lt;/ref&gt; and will be a 7-meter diameter [[sphere]] made from [[steel]] circles, and will be placed at Reine in Lofoten.

The scale of Planet Lofoten is 1: 200 million.

The artist [[Jan Wanggaard]] says about the project that he intend nothing with the installation other than letting it stay there and maybe inspire people who bump into it in one or the other way ‒ as an artistic expression or a nice tool to help understand the size and proportions of the Solar System that we all live in.

The [[documentary film]] ''[[Alt Flyter]]'' (Panta Rei) by [[Lars Nilssen]] follows Wanggaard during the realization process of Planet Lofoten over a period of three years.

The documentary won [[Award for Creativity]] at FIFA, the worlds biggest [[Art Film Festival]] In [[Montreal]], [[Canada]] in 2007 and has since then been shown at several [[Art museum|galleries]] around the world including [[The Louvre]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4334">[[Image:Rahotep statue.jpg|thumb|180px|right|[[Rahotep]], a superintendent of the military, and military supplies, including archers&amp;ndash;(Note Archer hieroglyph, and quiver hieroglyph).&lt;br/&gt;(Superintendent-(overseer): is ''‘[[Emir]]’'', represented by the ''[[owl (hieroglyph)|Owl]]'' above ''[[mouth (hieroglyph)|mouth]]'' hieroglyphs, for ''"m-r"'', 'emeer'.) ]]

The '''''Pítati''''' ('''''pí-ta-ti''''') were a contingent of [[archery|archers]] of [[ancient Egypt]] that were often requested and dispatched to support Egyptian [[vassal]]s in [[Canaan]]. They are recorded in the [[text corpus|correspondence]] of the [[1350 BC]] [[Amarna letters]], and were often requested to defend against the [[Habiru]], also rogue vassal-kings and foreign troops of neighboring kingdoms (for example, [[Hittites#History|Hatti]]), who were on the attack.

The vassal cities and "[[city-state]]s" were constantly requesting the services-(protection) of the Pharaoh's armies, by means of this "archer-army" force, basically [[garrison]] forces. A request for lodging, and preparations of [[food]], [[drink]], [[straw]], and other supplies required,&lt;ref&gt;Moran, William L., 1992. ''The Amarna Letters,'' p. 352-353. ''EA 325'': Title: (from, Man of the City: [[Yidya]]): ''Preparations completed, (2)'', &lt;br/&gt;"...indeed prepared absolutely everything&amp;mdash;food, strong drink, oxen, 'sheep and goats', grain, straw, absolutely everything that the king, my lord, commanded."&lt;/ref&gt; is often demanded by the pharaoh, for a small, or a large contingent.

The pítati archer force were [[Mercenary|mercenaries]] from the southern Egyptian "land of [[Kingdom of Kush|Kush]]"-(named ''Kaša'', or ''Kaši'' in the letters).

The first use of [[Nubians|Nubian]] [[mercenary|mercenaries]] was by [[Autobiography of Weni|Weni]] of the [[Sixth Dynasty of Egypt]] during the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt]], about [[2300 BC]].

==A letter example--no. 337==
A vassal&amp;ndash;state letter example from Hiziru, a "mayor", often referred to as the "Man ([[Lugal]]) of the City", in ancient Palestine is [[Amarna letters|EA]] 337, entitled "Abundant supplies ready". The letter is short and undamaged:
{{quote|
Say to the king, my lord, my Sun, my god: Message of Hiziru, your servant. I [[prostration formula|fall at the feet]] of the king, my lord, 7 times and 7 times. The king, my lord, wrote to me, "Prepare the supplies before the arrival of a large army of''' '''''pí-ta-ti''''' '''of the king, [m]y l[ord]." May the god of the king, my lord, grant that the king, my lord, come forth along with his large army and learn about his lands. I have indeed prepared accordingly abundant supplies before the arrival of a large army of the king, my lord.

The king, my lord, wrote to me, "Guard Maya," the [[commissioner]] of the king, my lord. Truly. I guard Maya very carefully. -EA 337, lines 1-30 (complete)
}}

=="Archers and myrrh"==
Letter no. 3 of 5 by [[Milkilu]] of Gazru (modern [[Gezer]]):
{{quote|Say to the god, my king, my lord, my Sun: Message of [[Milkilu]], your servant, the dirt at your feet. I [[prostration formula|fall at the feet]] of the god, my king, my lord, my Sun, 7 times and 7 times. I have heard what the king, my lord, wrote to me, and so may the king, my lord, send the ''[[Archery|archers]]'' to his servants, and may the king, my lord send [[myrrh]] for [[Pharmaceutical drug|medication]].  -EA 269, lines 1-17 (complete)}}

==Analysis==
Part of the debate in analyzing the army-archer-force is whether the army just annually accompanied the pharaoh's commissioner or [[envoy (title)|envoy]] and were then extracting [[tribute]], or whether the archer-force duty was strictly military, and in support of the Egyptian borderlands control and influence. The short time period of the [[Amarna letters]], 15–20 years, (17?), may give an answer to the influence of the archer-forces.

'''Ridge A''' is a site in [[Antarctica]] that was identified in 2009 as the best suited location on the surface of Earth for astronomical research.&lt;ref name="Saunders et al. 2009"&gt;{{Citation |last=Saunders |first=Will |last2=Lawrence |first2=Jon S. |last3=Storey |first3=John W.

The site is on the [[Antarctic Plateau]] at an altitude of {{convert|4053|m|ft}}, and has an average winter temperature of {{convert|-70|°C|°F|0}}. It is possible that this site may have even lower temperatures than Dome A.&lt;ref name="Saunders et al. 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wond"&gt;{{citation |title = Ridge A - best place for astronomy research on Earth |publisher = Wondermondo |date =  27 September 2010 |url = http://www.wondermondo.com/Countries/An/Antarctica/Antarctica/RidgeA.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ridge A was identified by a team of Australian and American scientists searching for the best [[observatory]] spot in the world.&lt;ref name="Saunders et al. 2009"/&gt; The team leader described the site as "so calm there's almost no wind or weather there at all."&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;Kenber, Billy. [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/antarctica/6121866/Scientists-identify-coldest-place-on-earth.html "Scientists identify coldest place on earth"], ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'', September 1, 2009. Accessed September 9, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Ridge A is a low ridge of ice and has been estimated to have very low disturbances to visibility, such as thick atmospheric boundary layer, amount of water vapour and numerous others.

The site represents the "[[Eye (cyclone)|Eye of the Storm]]", whereby winds flowing off Antarctica in all directions appear to start from a point at Ridge A, where winds are at their calmest. It is also the site of a vortex in which swirling [[stratosphere|stratospheric]] winds high up and calm air at ground level combine to make it a place for viewing into space that is three times clearer than any other location on Earth.&lt;ref name=BrisbaneTimes&gt;Casey, Scott. [http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/technology/the-coldest-driest-place-in-the-world-20090902-f7uw.html "The coldest, driest place in the world"], ''[[Brisbane Times]]'', September 2, 2009. Accessed September 9, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers{{Who|date=February 2011}} on the project suggested that photographs taken through a telescope at Ridge A could be nearly as good as those taken by the [[Hubble Space Telescope]]. Despite the difficult conditions on Antarctica and the remote location of Ridge A, construction costs for an observatory there that could match the Hubble telescope could be built at a fraction of the cost of sending Hubble into space.&lt;ref name=BrisbaneTimes/&gt;

For several years a second [[Giant Magellan Telescope]] in Antarctica has been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Angel |first=Roger |last2=Lawrence |first2=Jon |last3=Storey |first3=John |year=2004 |title=Concept for a second Giant Magellan Telescope (GMT) in Antarctica |url=http://caao.as.arizona.edu/publications/GMT%20final%20fixes.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Observatory==

Since January 2012, a small international observatory, the [[High Elevation Antarctic Terahertz Telescope|High Elevation Antarctic Terahertz (HEAT) telescope]], has operated at Ridge A, jointly run by American and Australian researchers.&lt;ref name="sims"&gt;{{citation |title = Where is Ridge A? |last=Sims |first=Geoff |last2=Kulesa |first2=Craig |last3=Ashley |first3=Michael C.B. |last4=Lawrence |first4=Jon S. |last5=Saunders |first5=Will |last6=Storey |first6=John W.V. |year=2012 |journal=Proc. SPIE 8444, Ground-based and Airborne Telescopes IV, 84445H |doi=10.1117/12.925512}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By virtue of the weather, this [[submillimetre astronomy|submillimetre]] or [[terahertz astronomy|terahertz]] telescope is capable of observing wavelengths of light that rarely make it through the atmosphere to the ground anywhere else on Earth.

== Country by country ==

=== Argentina ===
Argentina has included the topic of [[food sovereignty]] in framework law, though its status is sometimes controversial: Law 25.724 on the National Programme for Food and Nutrition Security, 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Knuth|2011}}: 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bangladesh ===
The right to food is enshrined in the constitution, Article 15 (Provision of basic necessities):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"It shall be a fundamental responsibility of the State to attain, through planned economic growth, a constant increase of productive forces and a steady improvement of the material and cultural standard of living of the people, with a view to securing to its citizens... the provision of the basic necessities of life, including food, clothing, shelter..."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Food and Agriculture Organization|1998}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2004, the Special Rapporteur leads a country mission to [[Bangladesh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food|2004a}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Benin ===
In 2010, the Special Rapporteur leads a country mission to [[Benin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food|2010e}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bolivia ===
[[Bolivia]] has included the topic of food sovereignty in framework law, though its status is sometimes controversial: Supreme Decree No 28667 of 5 April 2006; Food Law for Workers, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Knuth|2011}}: 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the Special Rapporteur leads a country mission to Bolivia.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food|2007a}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Brazil ===
The right to food is enshrined in the constitution, Article 227 (Right to food for children and teenagers):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"It is the duty of the family, of society, and of the State to ensure children and adolescents, with absolute priority, the right to life, health, food, education, leisure, professional training, culture, dignity, respect, freedom, and family and community life, in addition to safeguarding them against all forms of negligence, discrimination, exploitation, violence, cruelty, and oppression."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Food and Agriculture Organization|1998}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2003, the [[Fome Zero]] (Zero Hunger) government program is introduced by president Lula da Silva, with the objective to eradicate hunger and extreme poverty in [[Brazil]].

The '''Sierra Leone River''' is a river [[estuary]] on the [[Atlantic Ocean]] in Western [[Sierra Leone]]. It is formed by the [[Bankasoka River]] and [[Rokel River]] and is between 4 and 10 miles wide (6–16&amp;nbsp;km) and 25 miles (40&amp;nbsp;km) long. It holds the major ports of [[Queen Elizabeth II Quay]] and [[Pepel]]. The estuary is also important for shipping. It is the largest natural harbour in the African continent. Several islands, including [[Tasso Island]] (the largest), [[Tombo Island]], and the historically important [[Bunce Island]], are located in the estuary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9067679/Sierra-Leone-River "Sierra Leone River"] britannica.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lungi International Airport==
{{main article|Lungi International Airport}}
The river separates [[Freetown]], Sierra Leone's capital city, which is on the south side of the harbor, from the country's principal airport, [[Lungi International Airport]], which is on the north side of the harbor in an area called the "Bullom Shore."

{{Cossacks}}
'''Stanitsa''' ({{lang-rus|стани́ца|p=stɐˈnʲitsə}}; {{lang-uk|станиця}}, ''stanytsia'') is a village inside a [[Cossacks|Cossack]] [[Cossack host|host]] (viysko) ({{lang|ru|казачье войско}}, ''kazachye voysko'', sometimes translated as "Cossack Army"). Stanitsas were the primary unit of Cossack hosts.

While the word ''stanitsa'' in a modern usage survives, the stanitsa system in its historic context was effectively destroyed in the aftermath of the Russian revolution, when the [[Russian Civil War|Civil War]] and subsequent [[Collectivisation in the USSR|collectivisation]] of the land by the state in the [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]ist period and [[Holodomor]] destroyed the culture and the economic foundations of stanitsas.

==Historical definition==
Historically, the stanitsa was a unit of economic and political organisation of the Cossack peoples primarily in the southern regions of the [[Russian Empire]]. 

Much of the land was held in common by the stanitsa, subject to annual allocation to Cossack families by the [[Ataman]], the appointed leader of the community.  This was a fully democratic, unique process, characteristic of Russia's South only.   A similar democratic system was only used in Novgorod Republic, before its annexation by the Muscovite Tsardom.

==Modern usage==
[[File:Map of Russia - Stanitsa.svg|thumb|left|Regions of Russia where stanitsa are a type of settlement]]
In modern [[Russia]], stanitsas are classified as a type of [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|rural localities]] and are mostly predominant in the southern regions of [[Rostov Oblast]], [[Krasnodar Krai|Krasnodar]] and [[Stavropol Krai]]s and most of the Republics of the [[Northern Caucasus]].

[[Major-General]] '''William Roy''' [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]], [[Society of Antiquaries of London|FSA]] [[FRSE]] (4 May 1726 – 1 July 1790) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[military engineer]], [[Surveyor (surveying)|surveyor]], and [[antiquarian]]. He was an innovator who applied new scientific discoveries and newly emerging technologies to the accurate [[Geodesy|geodetic]] mapping of Great Britain. His masterpiece is usually referred to as '''Roy's Map of Scotland'''.&lt;ref&gt;http://maps.nls.uk/geo/roy/#zoom=7&amp;lat=56.8860&amp;lon=-4.0709&amp;layers=roy-highlands&lt;/ref&gt;

It was Roy's advocacy and leadership that led to the creation of the [[Ordnance Survey]] in 1791, the year after his death. His technical work in the establishment of a [[baseline (surveying)|surveying baseline]] won him the [[Copley Medal]] in 1785. His maps and drawings of [[Roman Britain|Roman]] archaeological sites in [[Scotland]] were the first accurate and systematic study of the subject, and have not been improved upon even today. Roy was a fellow of the [[Royal Society]] and a member of the [[Society of Antiquaries of London]].

=== Early life and family ===
Roy was born at Milton Head in [[Carluke]] parish in [[South Lanarkshire]] on 4 May 1726.&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;{{harvtxt|Lee|1885–1900}} Dictionary of National Biography.&lt;/ref&gt;  His father was a [[Factor (Scotland)|factor]]&lt;ref&gt;A ''factor'' in Scotland is a representative of a landowner with the responsibilities of an estate manager.&lt;/ref&gt;  in the service of the Gordons/Hamiltons of Hallcraig, as well as an elder of the [[Church of Scotland|Kirk]]. His grandfather had held a similar position as factor, and his uncle acted in that capacity for the [[Lockharts of Lee]]. Thus Roy grew up in an environment where making land surveys and using maps was part of the daily business. He was educated in Carluke parish school and then [[Lanark Grammar School]].&lt;ref name=rankin&gt;
{{Harvcolnb|Rankin|1874}}  The Parish of Carluke, 1288 –1874
&lt;/ref&gt; There is no record of a further education such as that enjoyed by his  
younger brother James.&lt;ref&gt;James Roy had held the bursary in the Grammar School and College of Glasgow, took a Master of Arts after studies in the Languages and Philosophy, was licensed by the Presbytery of Glasgow, and held several other notable positions before his untimely death in 1767, at the age of 37.{{Harv|Rankin|1874}} 
&lt;/ref&gt;

The next few years of his life are poorly documented. Owen and Pilbeam claim&lt;ref name=owenpilbeam&gt;
{{harvtxt|Owen|Pilbeam|1992}} Ordnance Survey, map makers to Britain since 1791, Chapter 1, pages 3–11 is devoted to Roy.
&lt;/ref&gt;
that "Some time after 1738 (when Roy was 12) he moved to [[Edinburgh]] and gained experience of surveying and making plans, probably as a civilian draughtsman at the office of the Board of Ordnance at [[Edinburgh Castle]]." It is possible that he may have been employed there as a boy because it was normal procedure for the board to employ "cadets" aged ten or eleven who were trained to become civilian surveyors and draughtsmen. Roy was certainly associated with the board by 1746 (aged 20), for he was the author of an official map of [[Battle of Culloden|Culloden]] made soon after the battle.&lt;ref name=seymour&gt;
{{harvcolnb|Seymour|1980}}  A History of the Ordnance Survey. The material on Roy is in pages&amp;nbsp;3–9 for the Military Survey, pages13–18 for the Hounslow base, pages&amp;nbsp;33–37 for the calculation of the [[Anglo-French Survey (1784–1790)|Anglo-French Survey]] and pages&amp;nbsp;363–365 for his Instructions to Surveyors.&lt;/ref&gt;

As an employee of the board he would have come to notice of Lieutenant-Colonel David Watson,&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; Deputy Quartermaster-General of the Military District of [[North Britain]] for the board, whose headquarters was in Edinburgh. The terms of Roy's employment are unknown but must have some opportunity to undertake private surveys for he was reported as a respected land surveyor employed by the Callander family at their Craigforth estate near [[Stirling]] prior to his work for the military.&lt;ref name=campbell&gt;
{{Harvcolnb|Campbell|1832|p=32}} ''Memoirs of James Campbell of Ardkinglass'',&lt;/ref&gt;

Roy maintained his connections to his birthplace and the people living there. A servant for the Lockharts of Lee recalled his visits there over time, as his national reputation grew. She noted that at first he would dine in the servants hall, in later years he would dine with the family, and later still he would be seated at the right hand of the [[Laird]].&lt;ref name="rankin"/&gt;

==Roy as surveyor and soldier==

===The survey of Scotland===
[[Image:Mansewood1747-1755.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Detail (Pollokshaws, now in Glasgow) from a map in Roy's Military Survey of Scotland.&lt;ref name=roymap/&gt;]]
In 1747 Lieutenant-Colonel David Watson, Deputy Quartermaster-General, proposed the compilation of a map of the [[Scottish Highlands]] to facilitate the subjugation of the [[Scottish clan|clan]]s following the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] [[Jacobite rising of 1745|rising of 1745]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Porter|1889}} ''History of the Royal Engineers'', Vol. I, Chapter 8, pp. 167–199 covers the period 1743–1763. 
&lt;/ref&gt;
In response, King [[George II of Great Britain|George II]] commissioned a military survey of the Highlands, and Watson was placed in charge, under the command of the [[Prince William, Duke of Cumberland|Duke of Cumberland]],  but it fell to Roy "to begin, and afterwards to have a considerable share in, the execution of that map",&lt;ref name=roy85quote&gt;
Quotation from {{harvtxt|Roy|1785}}, The account of the Hounslow baseline
&lt;/ref&gt; now known as ''The Duke of Cumberland's Map''.

Roy was without any military rank at this 
time&lt;ref&gt;
Some sources wrongly attribute military rank or regiment to Roy in 1746: the obituary of {{Harvtxt|Burke|1793}}, page 212, states that Roy held the rank of colonel of artillery; a book by {{Harvtxt|Irving|1885}}, page 242, also has him as an army Colonel. Neither was Roy the nephew of David Watson as claimed by {{Harvtxt|Porter|1889}} in Volume 2 (page 229) of his history; Porter also quotes General Wolfe for the same error (page 388). {{harvtxt|Rankin|1784}} has him a Deputy Quartermaster General of the Survey in 1746.
&lt;/ref&gt; 
but Watson appointed him as an assistant to the quartermaster to provide him some seniority over the group of (typically) six soldiers who travelled with him: an NCO, two end markers, two chainmen and a batman.&lt;ref name=owenpilbeam/&gt;
From 1749 he was joined by another five junior surveyors for various periods of time: notable among these young assistants were [[Paul Sandby]] (born 1731), later renowned for his watercolour landscapes, and a seventeen-year-old [[David Dundas (British Army officer)|David Dundas]] (born 1735), later Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

Eventually there were six teams conducting surveys by traverses of the country with the objects to the side of the line recorded by sketches and compass directions. The Highlands were covered by 1752, but the survey was extended to the lowlands for another three years, until 1755, when most of the engineer surveyors were posted to war stations. In the introduction to the 1885 account of the measurement of the Hounslow baseline Roy writes that the map remained "in an unfinished state ... and is to be considered as a magnificent military sketch rather than a very accurate map of a country  ... (and) it would have been completed, and many of its imperfections no doubt remedied, but for the breaking out of war in 1755."&lt;ref name=roy85quote/&gt;
The eighty-four original field sheets and the thirty-eight divisions of the "fair-protraction"are held in the [[British Museum]] together with a small index map and a reduced map of the whole country in a single sheet published as "the King's map". It is now possible to view the map online.&lt;ref name=roymap&gt;
[http://maps.nls.uk/roy/index.html Roy's map] is held in the [[British Museum]] but it is available online by courtesy of the [[National Library of Scotland]]. The index page links to several views of the map including one in which it can be superimposed on the modern map.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military appointments===
Throughout the Survey of Scotland, Roy was a civilian assistant to David Watson the deputy quartermaster-general, but in 1755 the survey was terminated by the outbreak of the [[Seven Years' War]] with France and the consequent redeployment of personnel to more pressing posts in both the regular army and the [[Board of Ordnance]]. In the same year the engineers of the board were formed into the [[Royal Engineers|Corps of Engineers]].  The board officers were members of both structures, for they would be deployed with the army regiments for specialist duties.

In 1776 Roy was commissioned as a lieutenant in the [[53rd Foot]], a new regiment formed in 1755. At the same time he was appointed as a practitioner-engineer, the lowest rank in the Board of Ordnance survey department, and ensign in the Corps of Engineers.&lt;ref&gt;
{{Harvcolnb|Porter|1889}} ''History of the Royal Engineers'', vol. II, Part 2, Chapter 1, pp. 88–100 covers the structure of the Board of Ordnance.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|Anderson|2010}}, Chapter 3, gives full details of the structure of the Board of Ordnance at the time of Roy. This thesis also contains many excellent images of maps and plans from the survey in the period.
&lt;/ref&gt; 
Thereafter Roy was promoted steadily, and rapidly, in both structures, but his army rank was always greater than his board rank. For example, he was lieutenant-colonel in the army by 1762 and director and lieutenant-colonel of the Engineers in 1783. He is best known by his army rank of major-general, which he attained in 1781.&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|Close|1924}}, p. 4, and {{harvtxt|Rankin|1784}}, online,  give a details of Roy's promotions.
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Active service===
On the termination of the Scottish survey Roy, now under the jurisdiction of two military bodies, was posted in 1756 to the South of England where he was engaged, together with Watson and Dundas, in inspecting the readiness of coastal military installations in preparation for an expected French invasion. This work involved Roy in the production of plans of fortifications and rough maps of stretches of the south coast: examples are a sketch of the country from Gloucester to Pembroke, with Milford Haven and a sketch of the country betwixt Guildford and Canterbury. These sketches are preserved in the [[British Library]].

By 1757 Roy was with his regiment in France for the Rochefort expedition and then in Germany for the [[Battle of Minden]] in 1759. His technical abilities and willingness to innovate brought him to the favourable attention of his commanders.  Preparatory to the battle, the various military engineers made drawings of each step of the coming battle, with each step drawn on a different sheet of paper. The commander could then study the course of the battle before it occurred, going from one sheet to the next. Lieutenant Roy, however, made his drawings on a single sheet with coordinated and accurate overlays, so that the commander could more easily study the course of the battle by examining a single sheet of paper. The commander's comprehension was greatly facilitated, and Roy's methodology was soon adopted as an advancement in military science.&lt;ref name=campbell/&gt; Thereafter his promotion was rapid, and by the end of the war in 1763 Roy was a lieutenant colonel in the regiment and director of the engineers of the Board of Ordnance as well as being the deputy quartermaster general for Germany.

===Surveyor-general===
[[File:Major-general-william-roy blue plaque.jpg|thumb|Blue plaque at Roy's London home, 10 Argyll Street.]]
At the conclusion of the war in 1763 Roy returned to London, where he was based for the rest of his life. The threatened French invasion of the south coast had never materialised, but he felt strongly that the reconnaissances he had made with Watson at the outbreak of the war should be extended to a national survey, not just of the vulnerable south but the whole of the British Isles. He never ceased to champion this cause, but the expense of the [[Seven Years' War]] and then the [[American War of Independence]] excluded any expenditure on trigonometrical surveys for another twenty years.

In 1765 he was appointed surveyor-general under a royal warrant which directed him "to inspect, survey and make reports from time to time of the state of the coasts of this Kingdom and the islands thereunto belonging." This work, which took him to many parts of Britain and abroad (Ireland and [[Gibraltar]]), is recorded in the many plans and sketch maps of districts that are now lodged at the [[British Library]].

Despite the travel Roy was able to enter fully into the intellectual life of London, and in 1767 he became a fellow of the [[Royal Society]].  The only paper he read before the society was in 1783 on ''Rules for measuring heights with a barometer''. Roy was promoted to colonel in 1777, and to major-general in 1781. He was in charge of the departments of the Quartermaster-General and Chief Engineer in 1782, and in 1783 became the director of Royal Engineers.

===The Anglo-French survey===
{{main|Anglo-French Survey (1784–1790)}}
Late in life, when he was 57, Roy was granted the opportunity to establish his lasting reputation in the world of geodesy. The opening came from a completely unexpected direction. In 1783 the [[Dominique, comte de Cassini|Comte de Cassini]] addressed a memoir to the Royal Society in which he expressed grave reservations of the measurements of latitude and longitude which had been undertaken at [[Royal Greenwich Observatory|Greenwich Observatory]]. He suggested that the correct values might be found by combining the [[Paris Observatory]] figures with a precise [[trigonometric]] survey between the two observatories.&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvcolnb|Maskelyne|1787}} includes Cassini's memoir (in French) and his rebuttal.
&lt;/ref&gt; 
Sir [[Joseph Banks]], president of the [[Royal Society]], proposed that Roy should lead the project. Roy accepted with enthusiasm for he saw that apart from the specific measurements proposed the survey could be the first step towards the national survey that he had advocated so often. The whole project is described by Roy in three major contributions to the [[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society]]  in 
1785,&lt;ref name=roy1785&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Roy|1785}} The measurement of the Hounslow baseline.&lt;/ref&gt;
1787&lt;ref name=roy1787&gt;{{harvcolnb|Roy|1787}} Proposals for the triangulation&lt;/ref&gt; and

&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cannon in Roy Grove Hampton.jpg|thumb|Cannon in Roy Grove, Hampton marking the Hampton end of the first baseline of the triangulation of Great Britain]]
After a preliminary survey by Roy and three other members of the Society on 16 April, they found a suitable location for the starting baseline on [[Hounslow|Hounslow Heath]], between King's Arbour and [[Hampton, London|Hampton]] Poor-house just over 5 miles to the south-east. A preliminary measurement of the line was carried out with a steel chain prepared by [[Jesse Ramsden]]. It was the intention to measure more accurately with a set of three deal rods about 20&amp;nbsp;ft. in length but their use had to be abandoned because of their susceptibility to lengthen and shorten in wet weather. The deal rods were replaced by one-inch-thick glass tubes of the same length. The final measurement gives the length of the base as 27404.7&amp;nbsp;ft. to an accuracy of about 3 inches in 5 miles (or about 1/100,000). The precision of this baseline measurement far exceeded any previous attempts, and in recognition Roy was awarded the [[Copley medal]]  by the Royal Society in 1785.

[[File:Anglo-French survey of 1784-1790 Proposed mesh.jpg|center|thumb|800px|The proposed triangulation mesh of the Anglo-French survey 1784–1790.&lt;ref name=roy1787/&gt; For the actual mesh used see [[:File:Anglo-French survey of 1784-1790.jpg]]]]
The triangulation itself was delayed until 1787 when Ramsden supplied a [[Ramsden surveying instruments|new theodolite]] of unsurpassed accuracy: it could measure angles to within one arc second and therefore detect the curvature of the Earth by measuring the 
[[Spherical trigonometry#Area and spherical excess|spherical excess]] of the triangles of the survey. By the end of that year he had completed measurements at all but two of the trigonometric stations. Many of the measurements, particularly the cross channel sightings,  were taken at night using intense flares (handled by the artillery). Others required the placing of the instrument on church towers, or even on scaffolded steeples, and in their absence it was sometimes necessary to use a specially constructed portable tower some 30 feet high.

The final report of 1790&lt;ref name=roy1790/&gt; presents figures for the distance between Paris and Greenwich as well as the precise latitude, longitude and height of the British triangulation stations. Throughout the survey Roy took every opportunity to fix the position of as many landmarks as possible and these formed the basis of the [[Topography|topographic]] surveys from which new maps could be prepared. Roy died when only three pages of his final report remained to be proofed.

===Roy's scientific legacy===&lt;!--linked  where? --&gt;

Roy's use of scientific advancements and accurate mathematical formulas paved the way for modern geodesic surveying. His tenure and his work are the dividing line between older, approximate mappings and newer, highly accurate ones in Britain. He is cited repeatedly in early nineteenth century mathematics textbooks for his use of [[spherical trigonometry]] in surveying.&lt;ref&gt;
{{Harvcolnb|Hutton|1831|pp=26–98}} ''A Course of Mathematics'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=Gw44AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA26 Spherical Trigonometry], for example.
&lt;/ref&gt; 
Early twentieth century technical books on modern surveying and geodesy include Roy's work as the historical starting point for the modern profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Popplewell|1915|pp=170–71}} ''The Elements of Surveying and Geodesy'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=wlZDAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA170 Geodetic or Trigonometrical Surveying], for example.&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps his greatest legacy of all was the work of the [[Ordnance Survey]] which commenced in 1791, one year after his death, by extending the basic [[Anglo-French Survey (1784–1790)]] to the rest of Great Britain over the following sixty years.

==Roy as antiquary==
[[Image:Rough.Castle.Antonine.Wall.jpg|thumb|Rough Castle, on the Antonine Wall, drawn by William Roy in 1755.]]
During the Scottish Survey, Roy took careful note of the locations of ancient [[Rome|Roman]] remains, primarily military camps, wherever he encountered them and these were all marked precisely on the map sheets. This was the beginning of a lifelong interest in ancient Scottish history which he pursued whenever he was travelling the country in his capacity as Surveyor General.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Seymour|1980}} p62(true),76(pdf).&lt;/ref&gt; 
Roy's maps and his drawings of the relics of the Roman presence in Scotland were immediately seen as credible and valuable. For sites where the Roman remains were later destroyed by human development, his drawings are the only reliable record of their existence.
Roy was the first to systematically map the Antonine Wall and provide accurate and detailed drawings of its remains, an effort undertaken in 1764.&lt;ref&gt;
{{Harvcolnb|Hübner|1886|p=111}} ''Archaeologia Aeliana'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=4_4RAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA82 The Roman Annexation of Britain]
&lt;/ref&gt;

Roy's only historical work, ''Military Antiquities of the Romans in Britain'' was published posthumously in 1793.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Roy|1790b}},  ''Military Antiquities of the Romans in Britain.''&lt;/ref&gt; 
This book has a mixed reputation. His drawings and maps are held in the highest regard as still-valuable research sources. However, his efforts in the scholarly discussion of history are widely held to be without value, largely through no fault of his own. This was due to his belief that the spurious text of Charles Bertram ''[[De Situ Britanniae]]'' was a genuine work, a view shared by virtually all of his contemporaries. Roy consequently adjusted his perspective to be consistent with the history as told in the fraud, causing his own conclusions to be without a valid foundation. Much of Roy's research was devoted to the attempt to follow fictitious journeys throughout Scotland that were described in ''De Situ Britanniae''.

That Roy's considerable talents were partially wasted is a tragedy. He was a Scot with a lifelong interest in ancient Scottish history, and his technical ability and scientific knowledge made him uniquely qualified to provide information in an area of history where knowledge and understanding are minimal. That loss for Scottish history has been bemoaned by Scottish historians. In his introduction to ''Celtic Scotland'', [[William Forbes Skene|Skene]] deprecates those historical works based on ''De Situ'', including Roy's, but adds for him alone the comment that " ... perhaps more to be regretted, the valuable work of General Roy ..."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Skene|1886|p=22}} ''Celtic Scotland'', Introduction, [https://books.google.com/books?id=_kcNAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA22 Notation of Spurious Authorities]&lt;/ref&gt;
