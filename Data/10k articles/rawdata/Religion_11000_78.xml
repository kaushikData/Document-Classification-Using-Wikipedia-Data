      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2349">'''Advait Mat''' or '''Paramhans Advait Mat''' is a cluster of [[panth]]s (groups of disciples) in [[northern India]]. It was founded by [[Advaitanand Ji|Shri Swami Advaitanand Ji Maharaj]] (1846-1919) who is also known as Paramhans Dyal Ji Maharaj. He declared [[Swarupanand Ji|Swami Swarupanand Ji Maharaj]] ( also known as Shri Nangli Niwasi Bhagwan Ji) as his spiritual successor. Swami Swarupanand Ji Maharaj founded more than 300 ashrams with the purpose of disseminating his master's teachings. Swami Swarupanand Ji Maharaj had initiated more than thousand of his disciples into the [[Sanyasa|sanyas.]] Many of his disciples went on to establish spiritual institutions to spread the same knowledge. 

The ashrams founded by Shri Paramahans Dyal Ji were called Krishna Dwaras. The ashrams with the name Adwait-Swarup Ashram, Paramhans Satyarthi Dham, Shri Anandpur Satsang Ashram are also related to him and Shri Paramhans Advait Mat.

Reportedly, they perceive themselves to be originating from [[Totapuri]] in the 18th century, who was the guru of [[Ramakrishna]] as well.&lt;ref name="CushRobinson2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Denise Cush|author2=Catherine A.

==Creation==
In July 2010, Prince Al-Waleed, owner of a stake in [[News Corporation]], planned to collaborate with News Corp to launch a 24-hour Arabic-language news channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=News Corp., Saudi Prince Launching Arabic-Language News Channel |url=http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/news-corp-saudi-prince-launching-arabic-language-news-channel_b23962 |work=[[TV Newser]] |date=2010-07-09 |first=Alex |last=Weprin |accessdate=2011-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a year of deliberation, Al-Waleed announced on 13 September 2011 the launch of Alarab as a personal private venture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Alarab to focus on Arab shift |url=http://arabnews.com/saudiarabia/article501313.ece |work=[[Arab News]] |date=2011-09-13 |author=Ghazanfar Ali Khan |accessdate=2011-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said the channel's editorial stance would be "inspired by the [[Arab Spring|recent political events]] that have transformed the region, with particular attention to be paid to freedom of speech."&lt;ref name="ina"&gt;{{cite web|title=Al Waleed bin Talal Unveils New Channel Alarab |url=http://www.inaglobal.fr/en/television/article/al-waleed-bin-talal-unveils-new-channel-alarab |work=INA Global |date=2011-11-10 |first=Pamela |last=Haschke |accessdate=2011-12-19 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/643LFwu6V?url=http://www.inaglobal.fr/en/television/article/al-waleed-bin-talal-unveils-new-channel-alarab |archivedate=2011-12-19 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The channel was supposedly entirely privately funded, with Al-Waleed insisting that it would not receive instructions from the Saudi government.&lt;ref name="ina"/&gt; At the time of the launch, no mention was made of News Corp's involvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Prince Al-Waleed Unveils ‘Alarab’ Cable News Channel with Bloomberg as Partner, What About News Corp.? |url=http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/prince-al-waleed-unveils-alarab-cable-news-channel-with-bloomberg-as-partner-what-about-news-corp_b84787 |work=[[TV Newser]] |date=2011-09-13 |first=Alex |last=Weprin |accessdate=2011-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2011, [[Manama]], [[Bahrain]], was chosen as the network's headquarters.&lt;ref name="hq"/&gt; [[Doha]], [[Dubai]], [[Abu Dhabi]] and [[Beirut]] were also among the cities considered to host the network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=KSA prince eyes Doha as HQ for new international news channel |url=http://dohanews.co/post/10197352005 |work=Doha News |date=2011-09-13 |author=Shabinakhatri |accessdate=2011-12-19 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/643MRzyME?url=http://dohanews.co/post/10197352005 |archivedate=2011-12-19 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prince Al-Waleed retained close ties with the [[Al Khalifa family|Bahraini royal family]] while his [[Kingdom Holding Company]] maintains a presence in the country through indirect investments in the banking sector.&lt;ref name="khc"&gt;{{cite press release|title=Kingdom Holding Company : Crown Prince Salman Bin Hamad AlKhalifa &amp; Prince Alwaleed Attend Inauguration of "Bahrain the Capital of Arab Culture 2012" Under the Patronage of King of Bahrain |url=http://www.4-traders.com/KINGDOM-HOLDING-COMPANY-6500784/news/KINGDOM-HOLDING-COMPANY-Crown-Prince-Salman-Bin-Hamad-AlKhalifa-Prince-Alwaleed-Attend-Inauguration--14004689/ |publisher=[[Kingdom Holding Company]] |date=2012-02-04 |accessdate=2012-02-04 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65DNZRt3A?url=http://www.4-traders.com/KINGDOM-HOLDING-COMPANY-6500784/news/KINGDOM-HOLDING-COMPANY-Crown-Prince-Salman-Bin-Hamad-AlKhalifa-Prince-Alwaleed-Attend-Inauguration--14004689/ |archivedate=2012-02-05 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Arab was launched on 1 February 2015.&lt;ref name="AlArab_suspended_20150202" /&gt;

Al-Arab's regional competitors were Qatari-owned [[Al Jazeera]] and Saudi-government-owned [[Al Arabiya]], along with [[BSkyB]]'s [[Sky News Arabia]].&lt;ref name="ina"/&gt; In a January 2012 interview, Al-Waleed described Al Jazeera as the "masses channel" while implying that Al Arabiya is the "government channel" among the two main news channels in the Middle East. He stated his goal for Al-Arab to "takes the centre’s point of view" between the two networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=CNN talks exclusively to HH Prince Alwaleed bin Talal Abdulaziz Al Saud |url=http://cnnpressroom.blogs.cnn.com/2012/01/23/cnn-talks-exclusively-to-hh-prince-alwaleed-bin-talal-abdulaziz-alsaud/ |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=2012-01-23 |accessdate=2012-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ownership and management==
Al-Arab was privately owned by Prince [[Al-Waleed bin Talal]], independent from [[Kingdom Holding Company]] and [[Rotana Group]], two corporations controlled by the prince.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Prince Al Waleed and Bloomberg plan Arab news channel |url=http://www.thenational.ae/thenationalconversation/industry-insights/media/prince-al-waleed-and-bloomberg-plan-arab-news-channel |work=[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]] |date=2011-09-14 |first=Ben |last=Flanagan |accessdate=2011-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was headquartered in [[Manama]]'s Media City complex.&lt;ref name="hq"&gt;{{cite news |title=Bahrain to host Saudi prince's Rotana, news channel |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/12/28/us-bahrain-alwaleed-idUSTRE7BR0XL20111228 |agency=[[Reuters]] |date=2011-12-28 |first=Andrew |last=Hammond |accessdate=2012-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The channel was based outside [[Saudi Arabia]] as the country does not allow independent news channels to operate within its borders.&lt;ref name="ina"/&gt;

The channel's director was [[Jamal Khashoggi]], former editor of [[al-Watan (Saudi Arabia)|''Al Watan'']], a newspaper in Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref name="ina"/&gt; Khashoggi was removed as editor in 2010 after ''Al Watan'' published an article criticizing [[Salafism]], the fundamentalist Islamic movement that is Saudi Arabia's official state religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Head of Saudi's most daring newspaper resigns |url=http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2010/05/16/108790.html |publisher=[[Al Arabiya]] |date=2010-05-16 |accessdate=2011-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The channel partners with US financial news channel [[Bloomberg Television]], which would have provided five hours of daily programming, including financial bulletins, analysis, reports on regional business leaders, and global financial news.&lt;ref name="ina"/&gt; The partnership would have brought al-Arab into direct competition with Arabic-language financial news channel [[CNBC Arabiya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Alwaleed's new box of tricks |url=http://www.arabianbusiness.com/alwaleed-s-new-box-of-tricks-420536.html?page=1 |work=[[Arabian Business]] |date=2011-09-21 |first=Claire |last=Ferris-Lay |accessdate=2011-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bad management and shutdown==
On 1 February 2015, al-Arab's first day of programming included an interview with Bahraini Shi'a politician and former member of the [[Council of Representatives of Bahrain|Council of Representatives]], [[Khalil al-Marzooq]], who discussed the cancelling of 72 Bahrainis' citizenship. Broadcasting was suspended after the interview.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/03/world/middleeast/new-bahrain-based-channel-al-arab-suspends-service-after-opposition-leader-gets-airtime.html?_r=1

The shutdown of Al Arab TV was a result of the poor understanding of the market environment on behalf of the station's management. According to several marketing analysts, the senior managers of the station did not properly evaluate the political environment of Bahrain and the limitations that it has, hence their decision to interview a prime Bahraini opposition personality - something which the Bahraini government would not accept.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2047">[[Image:Ancile, Nordisk familjebok.png|thumb|Ancient shield illustration from ''[[Nordisk familjebok]]'']]

In [[ancient Rome]], the '''''ancilia''''' ([[Latin]], singular ''ancile'') were twelve sacred shields kept in the Temple of [[Mars (god)|Mars]]. According to [[Roman mythology|legend]], one divine shield fell from heaven during the reign of [[Numa Pompilius]], the second [[king of Rome]]. He ordered eleven copies made to confuse would-be thieves, since the original shield was regarded as one of the ''[[pignora imperii]]'', sacred guarantors that perpetuated Rome as a sovereign entity.

The ''ancilia'' were in the keeping of the [[Salii]], a body of twelve priests instituted for that purpose by Numa.&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab urbe condita]]'', 1:20&lt;/ref&gt; The Salii wielded them ritually in a procession throughout March.

==Etymology==
Ancient sources give varying etymologies for the word ''ancile''. Some derive it from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''ankylos'' (ἀγκύλος), "crooked". [[Plutarch]] thinks the word may be derived from the Greek ''ankōn'' (ἀγκών), "elbow", the weapon being carried on the elbow. [[Varro]] derives it ''ab ancisu'', as being cut or arched on the two sides, like the [[buckler]]s of the [[Thracians]] called [[pelta]]e.

==Myth==
When the original ''ancile'' fell, a voice was heard which declared that Rome should be mistress of the world while the shield was preserved. The Ancile was, as it were, the [[Palladium (mythology)|palladium]] of Rome.
Numa, by the advice, as it is said, of the [[nymph]] [[Egeria (mythology)|Egeria]], ordered eleven others, perfectly like the first, to be made. This was so that if anyone should attempt to steal it, as [[Odysseus|Ulysses]] did the Palladium, they might not be able to distinguish the true Ancile from the false ones.

[[Image:Paris psaulter gr139 fol3v.jpg|thumb|''The Anointing of David'', from the [[Paris Psalter]], 10th century ([[Bibliothèque Nationale]], Paris).]]

'''Anointing''' is the [[ritual|ritual act]] of pouring [[aromatic oil]] over a person's head or entire body.{{sfnp|EB|1878}} By extension, the term is also applied to related acts of sprinkling, dousing, or smearing a person or object with any [[perfume]]d oil, milk, butter, or other fat.{{sfnp|EB|1911|p=79}} Scented oils are used as perfumes and sharing them is an act of [[#Hospitality|hospitality]]. Their use to [[#Religion|introduce a divine influence or presence]] is recorded from the earliest times; anointing was thus used as [[#Health|a form of medicine]], thought to rid persons and things of dangerous spirits and demons which were believed to cause disease.

In present usage, "anointing" is typically used for ceremonial blessings such as the [[#Royalty|coronation of European monarchs]]. This continues an [[#Judaism|earlier Hebrew practice]] most famously observed in the anointings of [[Aaron]] as high priest and both [[Saul]] and [[David]] by the prophet [[Samuel (Bible)|Samuel]]. The concept is important to the figures of the [[Messiah]] and the [[Christ]] ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] for "The Anointed One") who appear prominently in [[Jewish theology|Jewish]] and [[Christian theology]] and [[eschatology]]. Anointing—particularly the [[anointing of the sick]]—may also be known as '''unction'''; the anointing of the dying as part of [[last rites]] in the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic church]] is sometimes specified as "[[extreme unction]]".

==Name==
{{anchor|Etymology}}
The present verb derives from the now obsolete adjective ''anoint'', equivalent to ''anointed''.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'', 1st ed. "anoint, ''v.''" Oxford University Press (Oxford), 1884.&lt;/ref&gt; The adjective is first attested in 1303,{{refn|group=n|Robert Manning's ''Handling Sin'': {{lang|enm|...Þe prest þat ys a noynt...}}&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Mannyng |first=Robert |title=Handlyng Synne |date=1303 |at=l.&amp;nbsp;7417 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} derived from [[Old French]] {{lang|fro|enoint}}, the [[past participle]] of ''enoindre'', from [[Latin]] {{lang|la|''inung''(''u'')''ere''|italic=unset}},&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'', 1st ed. "†&amp;nbsp;aˈnoint, ''adj.''" Oxford University Press (Oxford), 1884.&lt;/ref&gt; an [[intensifier|intensified]] form of {{lang|la|''ung''(''u'')''ere''|italic=unset}} ("to anoint"). It is thus cognate with "unction".

The oil used in a ceremonial anointment may be called "[[chrism]]" (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|χρῖσμα}}, ''khrîsma'', "anointing"),&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'', 1st&amp;nbsp;ed. "chrism, ''n.''" Oxford University Press (Oxford), 1889.&lt;/ref&gt; although Christianity usually distinguishes a particularly sanctified chrism from other oils which might also be used. Several related words such as "chrismation" (anointing with oil) and "chrismarium" (a vessel containing chrism or another holy oil) derive from the same root.

==Purpose==
Anointing served and serves three distinct purposes: it is regarded as a means of health and comfort, as a token of honor, and as a symbol of [[consecration]].{{sfnp|EB|1878}} It seems probable that its sanative purposes were enjoyed before it became an object of ceremonial religion, but the custom appears to predate written history and the archaeological record, and its genesis is impossible to determine with certainty.{{sfnp|EB|1878}}

===Health=== &lt;!--linked--&gt;
{{main|Anointing of the sick}}
Used in conjunction with bathing, anointment with oil closes [[skin pore|pore]]s.{{sfnp|EB|1878}} It was regarded as counteracting the influence of the [[sun]], reducing [[perspiration|sweating]].{{sfnp|EB|1878}} [[Aromatic oil]]s naturally masked [[body odor|body]] and other offensive odors,{{sfnp|EB|1878}} and other forms of fat could be combined with perfumes.

Applications of oils and fats are also used as [[traditional medicine]]s. The [[Bible]] records [[olive oil]] being applied to the sick and poured into wounds.{{refn|group=n|This occurs both in the [[Old Testament|Old]]&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Isaiah|1:6|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[New Testament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Mark|6:13|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||James|5:14-15|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{sfnp|Easton|1897}} Known sources date from times when anointment already [[#Religion|served a religious function]]; therefore, anointing was also used to combat the malicious influence of [[demon]]s in [[Persian mythology|Persia]], [[Armenian mythology|Armenia]], and [[Ancient Greek religion|Greece]].{{sfnp|EB|1911|p=79}} It was more recently used in [[traditional Indian medicine]] to remove illness, "bad luck", and "[[demonic possession]]".{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} Anointing was also understood to "seal in" goodness and resist corruption, probably via analogy with the use of a top layer of oil to preserve wine in ancient [[amphora]]s, its spoiling usually being credited to demonic influence.{{sfnp|EB|1911|p=80}}

For sanitary and religious reasons, the bodies of the dead are sometimes anointed.{{refn|group=n|The Bible records the practice at the time of the [[New Testament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Mark|14:8|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Luke|23:56|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{sfnp|Easton|1897}} In medieval and early modern Christianity, the practice was particularly associated with protection against [[vampire]]s and [[ghoul]]s who might otherwise take possession of the corpse.{{sfnp|EB|1911|p=80}}

===Hospitality=== &lt;!--linked--&gt;
Anointing guests with oil as a mark of hospitality and token of honor is recorded in [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], [[Ancient Greece|Greece]], and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], as well as in the [[Hebrew Bible|Hebrew scriptures]].{{sfnp|EB|1878}} It was a common custom among the [[Hebrews|ancient Hebrews]]{{refn|group=n|In the [[Old Testament]], it is mentioned in the [[Second Book of Samuel]]&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Samuel|14:2|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Book of Psalms]]&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Psalms|104:15|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; among other places.{{sfnp|Easton|1897}} In the [[New Testament]], [[Luke 7|Chapter 7]] of the [[Book of Luke]] records [[Jesus]]'s being anointed while visiting the house of a [[Pharisee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Luke|7:38-46|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} and continued among the [[Arabs]] into the 20th century.{{sfnp|Easton|1897}}

For about 3,000 years, [[Persian people|Persian]] [[Zoroastrians]] honor their guests with [[rose extract]] (''golab'') while holding a mirror in front of their guest's face.{{why?|date=June 2015}} The guests hold their palms out, collect the [[rose water]], and then spread the perfumed liquid upon their faces and sometimes heads. The words of ''rooj kori aka'' (similar to [[Have a nice day]]) might be said as well.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

===Religion=== &lt;!--linked--&gt;
{{further|Sacrifice}}
In the [[sympathetic magic]] common to [[prehistoric religion|prehistoric]] and [[Iron Age religion|primitive religions]], the [[fat]] of [[sacrifice|sacrificial animals]] and [[human sacrifice|persons]] is often reckoned as a powerful charm, second to blood as the vehicle and seat of life.{{sfnp|EB|1911|p=79}}&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Smith |first=William Robertson |author-link=William Robertson Smith |title=Lectures on the Religion of the Semites }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[East Africa]]n [[Arabs]] traditionally anointed themselves with lion's fat to gain courage and provoke fear in other animals. [[Australian Aborigines]] would rub themselves with a human victim's [[caul fat]] to gain his powers.{{sfnp|EB|1911|p=79}}

In religions like Christianity where animal sacrifice is no longer practiced, it is common to [[consecration|consecrate]] the oil in a special ceremony.{{sfnp|EB|1911|p=80}}

====Egypt====
[[Image:Ancient Egyptian King.jpg|thumb|Anointing of Pharaoh in [[Ancient Egypt]], image from the 1901-1906 ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]''.]]
In inscriptions from [[Ancient Egypt]], especially from the [[New Kingdom]] onward, anointing is often depicted in intimate scenes between husband and wife, where the wife is shown anointing her spouse as a sign of affection. The most famous example of this is on the [[throne]] of [[Tutankhamun]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} Anointment of the corpse with sweet-smelling oils was an important part of [[mummification]]. The completed [[mummy]] would also receive a final anointing before the sealing of its coffin.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

====India====

{{further|Abhisheka}}
In [[religions of India|Indian religion]], [[historical Vedic religion|late Vedic]] rituals developed involving the anointing of government officials, worshippers, and idols. These are now known as [[abhisheka]]. The practice spread to [[Buddhism in India|Indian Buddhists]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} In modern [[Hinduism]] and [[Jainism]], anointment is common, although the practice typically employs water or yoghurt, milk, or (particularly) butter{{sfnp|EB|1911|p=79}} from the [[cattle in religion|holy cow]], rather than oil. Many devotees are anointed as an act of consecration or blessing at every stage of life, with rituals accompanying [[birthing]], educational enrollments, [[initiation|religious initiation]]s, and [[last rites|death]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} New buildings, houses, and ritual instruments are anointed,{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} and some idols are anointed daily. Particular care is taken in such rituals to the ''direction'' of the smearing. People are anointed from head to foot, downwards.{{sfnp|EB|1911|p=79}} The water may derive from [[list of major rivers of India|one of the holy rivers]] or be scented with [[saffron]], [[turmeric]], or [[flower]] [[infusion]]s; the waste water produced when cleaning certain idols or when [[Indian calligraphy|writing certain verses]] of scripture may also be used.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} Ointments may include ashes, clay, powdered [[sandalwood]], or herbal pastes.

====Buddhism====
[[Buddhism|Buddhist]] practices of anointing are largely derived from Indian practices but tend to be less elaborate and more ritualized. Buddhists may sprinkle assembled practitioners with water or mark idols of [[Buddha]] or the [[Bodhisattva]]s with cow or [[yak butter]]. Flower-scented water is also used, as are ink-water and "saffron water" stained yellow using [[saffron]] or [[turmeric]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

{{main|Holy anointing oil}}
In antiquity, use of a [[holy anointing oil]] was significant in the [[Hebrews]]' consecration of priests,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Exodus|29:7|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Kohen Gadol]] (High Priest),&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Exodus|29:29|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Leviticus|4:3|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the sacred vessels.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Exodus|30:26|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Easton|1897}} [[Prophet]]s{{refn|group=n|See, e.g., the [[1st Book of Kings]],&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Kings|19:16|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[1st Book of Chronicles]],&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Chronicles|16:22|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Psalm 105]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Psalm|105:15|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} and the [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Israelite]] kings were also anointed as well,{{sfnp|Easton|1897}} the kings from a horn.&lt;ref name="bibleverse|1|Samuel|16:13|KJV"&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Samuel|16:13|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anointment by the [[holy anointing oil|chrism]] prepared according to the ceremony described in the [[Book of Exodus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Exodus|30:22-25|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; was considered to impart the "Spirit of the Lord".&lt;ref name="bibleverse|1|Samuel|16:13|KJV"/&gt; It was performed by [[Samuel (Bible)|Samuel]] in place of a [[coronation]] of either [[Saul]]&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1 Sam|10:1|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[David]].{{sfnp|Easton|1897}} The practice was not always observed and seems to have been essential only at the consecration of a new line or dynasty.{{sfnp|EB|1878}}

Because of its importance, the High Priest and the king were sometimes called "the Anointed One".{{refn|group=n|As, e.g., in [[Leviticus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Leviticus|4:3-5|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse-nb||Leviticus|4:16|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse-nb||Leviticus|6:20|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Psalm 132]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Psalm|132:10|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{sfnp|Easton|1897}}  The term—{{lang|he|מָשִׁיחַ|rtl=yes}}, ''Mashiaẖ''—gave rise to the prophesied figure of the [[Messiah]] (''q.v.''){{refn|group=n|As, e.g., in [[Psalm 2]]&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Psalm|2:2|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Book of Daniel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Daniel|7:13|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Daniel|9:25-26|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} and a [[Jewish messianism|long history of claimants]].

The expression "anoint the shield" which occurs in [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]]&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Isaiah|21:5|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a related or poetic usage, referring to the practice of rubbing oil on the leather of the shield to keep it supple and fit for war.{{sfnp|Easton|1897}}  The practice of anointing a shield predates the anointing other objects in that the "smearing" (Hebrew "mashiach") of the shield renewed the leather covering on a wooden shield.  A victorious soldier was elevated on his shield by his commrades after a battle or upon his selection as a new king.  The idea of protection and selection arose from this and was extended to the idea of a "chosen one" thus leading to the modern concept of a Messiah (Hebrew for the one who was anointed.)

[[Christianity]] developed from the association of [[Jesus of Nazareth]] with the Jewish prophesies of an "Anointed One".{{refn|group=n|The claim is explicit in [[Book of John|John]]&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||John|1:41|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Book of Acts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Acts|9:22|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse-nb||Acts|17:2-3|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse-nb||Acts|18:5|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse-nb||Acts|18:28|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} His epithet "[[Christ]]" is a form of the [[Greek language|Greek]] equivalent of the Hebrew title. He was not anointed by the High Priest in accordance with the ceremony described in Exodus, but he was considered to have been anointed by the [[Holy Spirit]] during [[Baptism of Jesus|his baptism]].{{refn|group=n|A [[Isaiah 61|passage in Isaiah]]&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Isaiah|61:1|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; is understood by Christians as saying that the [[Messiah]] will be baptized by the Holy Spirit rather than in a formal ceremony at the [[Temple of Solomon|Temple]].{{sfnp|Easton|1897}}}} A literal [[anointing of Jesus]] also occurs when he was lavishly oiled by [[Mary of Bethany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|John|12:1–12:11}}; also {{bibleverse|Matthew|26:6–26:13}}, {{bibleverse|Mark|14:1–14:11}}, and {{bibleverse|Luke|7:36–7:50}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fleming|first=Daniel|title=The Biblical Tradition of Anointing Priests|journal=Journal of Biblical Literature|year=1998|volume=117|issue=3|pages=401–414|jstor=3266438}}&lt;/ref&gt; Performed out of affection, the anointment is said by Jesus to have been preparation for [[Death of Jesus|his burial]].

In the [[New Testament]], John describes "anointing from the Holy One"&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|John|2:20|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "from Him abides in you".&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|John|2:27|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both this spiritual anointment{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} and literal anointment with oil are usually associated with the [[Holy Spirit]]. [[#Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]] churches in particular attach great importance to the oil said to have been originally blessed by the [[Twelve Apostles]].

The practice of "[[chrismation]]" ([[baptism]] with oil) appears to have developed in the [[early Christian church|early church]] during the later 2nd century as a symbol of Christ, rebirth, and inspiration.&lt;ref name=fergy/&gt; The earliest surviving account of such an act seems to be the letter written "To Autolycus" by [[Theophilus of Antioch|Theophilus]], [[bishop of Antioch]]. In it, he calls the act "sweet and useful", punning on ''khristós'' ({{lang-grc-gre|χριστóς}}, "anointed") and ''khrēstós'' ({{lang|grc|χρηστóς}}, "useful"). He seems to go on to say "wherefore we are called Christians on this account, because we are anointed with the oil of God",&lt;ref&gt;[[Theophilus of Antioch]], "To Autolycus", 1.12.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=n|The passage is somewhat uncertain as the earliest surviving manuscript has "mercy" ({{lang|grc|ἔλεoς}}, ''éleos'') instead of "oil" ({{lang|grc|ἔλαιoν}}, ''élaion''), but a corrector has emended this to "oil" in agreement with the other two manuscripts.}} and "what person on entering into this life or being an [[Greek athletes|athlete]] is not anointed with oil?"&lt;ref name=fergy&gt;{{cite book|last=Ferguson|first=Everett|title=Baptism in the Early Church: History, Theology, and Liturgy in the First Five Centuries|year=2009|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans|location=Kindle Locations 5142-5149|isbn=0802827489|page=269}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice is also defended by [[Hippolytus of Rome|Hippolytus]] in his "Commentary on the [[Song of Songs]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Yancy|title=The Mystery of Anointing|year=2013|publisher=Gorgias|isbn=1463202180|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[Origen]] in his "Commentary on [[Book of Romans|Romans]]". Origen opines that "all of us may be baptized in those visible waters and in a visible anointing, in accordance with the form handed down to the churches".&lt;ref&gt;[[Origen]], "Commentary on [[Book of Romans|Romans]]", 5.8.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anointing was particularly important among the [[Gnostic Christianity|Gnostics]]. Many early [[Apocrypha (Biblical)|apocryphal]] and Gnostic texts state that [[John the Baptist]]'s [[water baptism|baptism by water]] was incomplete and that anointment with oil is a necessary part of the baptismal process. The [[Gospel of Philip]] claims that &lt;blockquote&gt;chrism is superior to baptism, for it is from the word "chrism" that we have been called "Christians", certainly not from the word "baptism". And it is from the "chrism" that the "Christ" has his name. For the [[God the Father|Father]] anointed the [[God the Son|Son]], and the Son anointed the apostles, and the apostles anointed us. He who has been anointed possesses everything. He possesses the [[Resurrection]], the Light, the [[Cross]], the [[Holy Spirit]]. The Father gave him this in the bridal chamber; he merely accepted the gift. The Father was in the Son and the Son in the Father. This is the [[Kingdom of Heaven (Gospel of Matthew)|Kingdom of Heaven]].&lt;/blockquote&gt; In the [[Acts of Thomas]], the anointing is the beginning of the baptismal ritual and essential to becoming a Christian, as it says God knows his own children by his seal and that the seal is received through the oil. Many such chrismations are described in detail through the work.

In medieval and early modern Christianity, the oil from the lamps burnt before the [[altar]] of a [[church (building)|church]] was felt to have particular sanctity. New churches and altars were anointed at their four corners during their [[dedication]], as were tombs, [[gong]]s, and some other ritual instruments and utensils.{{sfnp|EB|1911|p=80}}

In particular, James 5:14-15 illustrates that [https://www.thejerusalemgiftshop.com/anointing-oil anointing oil], applied in faith, is a powerful weapon against a spiritual attack of the enemy, which can translate into a disease designed to destroy the body.

=====Roman Catholicism=====
[[Image:Sacr Gelasianum 131v 132.jpg|thumb|The [[frontispiece (architecture)|frontispiece]] of the [[Vatican Library]]'s [[Gelasian Sacramentary]] manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;[[Vatican Library]] {{abbr|MS|manuscript}} Reginensis 316.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], [[Anglican Church|Anglican]] and [[Lutheran|Lutheran Churches]] bless three types of [[Holy Oil (Christianity)|holy oil]]s for anointing: "[[Oil of catechumens|Oil of the Catechumens]]" (abbreviated OS, from the [[Latin]] {{lang|la|oleum sanctum}}, meaning holy oil), "Oil of the Infirm" (OI), and "[[Chrism|Sacred Chrism]]" (SC). The first two are said to be [[blessing|blessed]], while the chrism is [[consecrated]]. 

The Oil of Catechumens is used to anoint the [[catechumen]]s (adults preparing for reception into the church) just before their receipt of the Sacrament of [[Baptism]]. Infants receiving the Sacrament of Baptism are also anointed with that same oil during the rite of Baptism, just before receiving the Sacrament. In the early Church converts seeking baptism underwent a period of formation known as catechumenate, and they received one or more anointings with the oil of cathecumens during this period of instruction, with the purpose of expelling evil spirits. {{sfnp|EB|1911|p=80}} The oil of catechumens is also used in the [[extraordinary form of the Roman Rite]] to anoint the hands of a newly ordained Priest during the rite of Ordination to the presbyterate (whereas the head and the hands of a Bishop are anointed with Sacred Chrism during the rite of Episcopal Consecration). In the newer, ordinary form of the Roman Rite, both Priests and Bishops are anointed with Chrism, and the oil of catechumens ceased to be used for ordinations: in the rite of priestly ordination the hands are anointed with Chrism and in the rite of episcopal ordination only the head is anointed with Chrism. The Roman Pontifical of the extraordinary form of the Roman Rite also contemplates the use of the oil of Catechumens for the anointing of Kings and Queens during a rite of Coronation (although some countries were allowed to use different rites of Coronation other than the rite contained in the Roman Pontifical, and some of those rites prescribed the use of Chrism for the anointing of the monarch. This was the case, for instance, of the old French ritual).

Oil of the Infirm is used for administration of the Sacrament of [[Anointing of the Sick]] (known as [[Extreme Unction]] in the extraordinary form of the Roman Rite), the ritual treatment of the sick and infirm through anointment. 

Sacred Chrism is used in the Sacraments of [[Baptism]], [[confirmation (sacrament)|Confirmation]], and Holy Orders. It is also used in the dedication of new Churches, new Altars, and in the consecration of new patens and chalices for use in Mass. In the case of the Sacrament of Baptism, it must be noted that the subject receives two distinct unctions: one with the oil of catechumens, prior to being baptized, and then, after baptism with water is performed, the subject receives an unction with Chrism. In the case of the Sacrament of Confirmation, anointing with Chrism is the essential part of the Rite.

Any [[bishop]] may consecrate the holy oils. They normally do so every [[Maundy Thursday|Holy Thursday]] at a special "Chrism Mass". In the [[Gelasian sacramentary]], the formula for doing so is:{{sfnp|EB|1911|p=80}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;Send forth, O Lord, we beseech thee, thy Holy Spirit the [[Paraclete]] from heaven into this fatness of oil, which thou hast deigned to bring forth out of the green wood for the refreshing of mind and body; and through thy holy benediction may it be for all who anoint with it, taste it, touch it, a safeguard of mind and body, of soul and spirit, for the expulsion of all pains, of every infirmity, of every sickness of mind and body. For with the same thou hast anointed priests, kings, and prophets and martyrs with this thy chrism, perfected by thee, O Lord, blessed, abiding within our bowels in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the [[Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Eastern Catholic]] churches, confirmation is known as [[chrismation]]. The Mystery of Chrismation is performed immediately after the Mystery of [[Baptism]] as part of a single ceremony. The ritual employs the sacred ''myron'' ({{lang|grc|μύρον}}, "[[chrism]]"), which is said to contain a remnant of oil blessed by the [[Twelve Apostles]]. In order to maintain the apostolic blessing unbroken, the container is never completely emptied{{sfnp|EB|1911|p=80}} but it is refilled as needed, usually at a ceremony held on [[Maundy Thursday|Holy Thursday]] at the [[Patriarchate of Constantinople]]&lt;ref&gt;? {{cite web |url=http://www.goarch.org/en/ourfaith/articles/article8420.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-03-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030301104732/http://www.goarch.org/en/ourfaith/articles/article8420.asp |archivedate=2003-03-01 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; or the patriarchal cathedrals of the [[autocephalous]] churches.&lt;ref&gt;? [https://web.archive.org/web/20110927051129/http://ocaphoto.oca.org/PhotoViewer.asp?EID=186].&lt;/ref&gt; At the Patriarchate of Constantinople, the process is under the care of the ''[[Archon]]tes Myrepsoi'', lay officials of the Patriarchate. Various members of the clergy may also participate in the preparation, but the Consecration itself is always performed by the Patriarch or a bishop deputed by him for that purpose. The new ''myron'' contains olive oil, [[myrrh]], and numerous spices and perfumes. This ''myron'' is normally kept on the [[Holy Table]] or on the [[Table of Oblation]]. During chrismation, the "newly illuminate" person is anointed by using the ''myron'' to make the [[sign of the cross]] on the forehead, eyes, nostrils, lips, both ears, breast, hands, and feet. The priest uses a special brush for this purpose. Prior to the 20th century, the ''myron'' was also used for the anointing of Orthodox monarchs.

The oil that is used to anoint the [[catechumen]]s before baptism is simple olive oil which is blessed by the priest immediately before he pours it into the [[baptismal font]]. Then, using his fingers, he takes some of the blessed oil floating on the surface of the baptismal water and anoints the catechumen on the forehead, breast, shoulders, ears, hands, and feet. He then immediately baptizes the catechumen with threefold immersion in the name of the [[Trinity]].

Anointing of the sick is called the "[[Sacred Mystery]] of [[Unction]]". The practice is used for spiritual ailments as well as physical ones, and the faithful may request unction any number of times at will. In some churches, it is normal for all of the faithful to receive unction during a service on [[Holy Wednesday]] of [[Holy Week]]. The holy oil used at unction is not stored in the church like the ''myron'', but consecrated anew for each individual service. When an Orthodox Christian dies, if he has received the Mystery of Unction and some of the consecrated oil remains, it is poured over his body just before burial. It is also common to bless using oils which have been blessed either with a simple blessing by a priest (or even a venerated [[monastic]]), or by contact with some sacred object, such as [[relic]]s of a saint, or which has been taken from an [[oil lamp]] burning in front of a [[wonderworking]] [[icon]] or some other [[shrine]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

In the [[Armenian Orthodox Church|Armenian Church]], [[cross]]es are traditionally not considered holy until they have been anointed and prayed over, thus introducing the Holy Spirit into them. The same ritual was formerly observed in the other Orthodox churches.{{sfnp|EB|1911|p=80}}

=====Protestantism=====
Owing to their particular focus upon the action of the [[Holy Spirit]], [[Pentecostal Christianity|Pentecostal churches]] sometimes continue to employ anointing for consecration and ordination of pastors and elders, as well as for healing the sick.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

The Pentecostal expression "the anointing breaks the yoke" derives from a passage in [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]]&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Isaiah|10:27|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; which discusses the power given the prophet [[Hezekiah]] by the Holy Spirit over the tyrant [[Sennacherib]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

=====Latter-day Saints=====
The [[Doctrine and Covenants]] of the [[Latter-day Saints]] ([[Mormons]]) contains numerous references to the anointing and healing of the sick by those with authority to do so. [[Joseph Smith]] instituted anointing for other purposes on 21 January 1836, during the rites of sanctification and consecration preparatory to the [[Endowment (Latter Day Saints)|endowment]] rites practiced in the [[Kirtland Temple]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution-url=http://josephsmithpapers.org/topic?name=Anoint |contribution=Anoint |title=The Joseph Smith Papers |accessdate=24 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the present time, any holder of the [[Melchizedek priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Melchizedek Priesthood]] may anoint the head of an individual who is ill upon request. Olive oil must be used if available, and it must have been consecrated earlier in a short ordinance that any holder of the Melchizedek Priesthood may perform.

In addition to its use for the [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Israelite kingship]], anointing has been an important ritual in [[Coronation|Christian rites of Coronation]], especially in Europe.

Later French legend held that a vial of oil—the [[Holy Ampulla]]—descended from [[Heaven]] to anoint [[Clovis&amp;nbsp;I]] as [[King of the Franks]] following his conversion to Christianity in 493. The [[Kingdom of the Visigoths|Visigoth]] [[Wamba (king)|Wamba]] is the earliest [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] king known to have been anointed,{{sfnp|Lupoi|2000|pp=251&amp;nbsp;f}}{{sfnp|Moorhead|2001|p=173}} although the practice apparently preceded him in Spain.{{sfnp|Darras|1866|p=270}}{{refn|group=n|See [[Paul David King|King]] for the argument in favor of dating the practice to the 631 coronation of [[Sisenand]].{{sfnp|King|1972|pp=48–49}} }} The ceremony was performed in 672 by [[Quiricus (bishop of Toledo)|Quiricus]], the [[archbishop of Toledo]];{{sfnp|Darras|1866|p=270}} despite the king's strongly antisemitic laws, the ceremony hewed closely to the rite described by the [[Old Testament]].{{sfnp|Wolfram|1997|pp=273–274}} It was apparently copied a year later when [[Flavius Paulus]] defected and joined the [[Septimania]]n rebels he had been tasked with quieting.{{refn|group=n|The rebel general began his letter to his former liege "Flavius Paulus, anointed king in the east, [sends his greetings] to Wamba, king in the east" ({{lang|la|Flavius Paulus unctus rex orientalis Wambani regi austro}}).{{sfnp|Wolfram|1997|p=273}}}}{{sfnp|Wolfram|1997|p=273}} The rite epitomized the [[Catholic Church]]'s sanctioning the monarch's rule; it was notably employed by [[usurper]]s such as [[Pepin the Short|Pepin]], [[Carolingian dynasty|whose dynasty]] replaced the [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingians]] in [[Kingdom of France|France]] in 751. While it might be argued that the practice subordinated the king to the church, in practice the sacral anointing of kings was seen as elevating the king to priestly or even saintly status.{{sfnp|Lupoi|2000|p=252}} It provided a directly religious aspect to Europe's regimes apart from the church hierarchy and, for political and practical reasons, was seldom performed by the [[pope]]s. Instead, the anointment was usually administered by a bishop from a major see of the realm, often the national [[primate (bishop)|primate]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} [[Maurizio Lupoi|Lupoi]] argues that this set in motion the conflicting claims that developed into the [[Investiture Crisis]].{{sfnp|Lupoi|2000|pp=251&amp;nbsp;f.}} At the same time, royal unction recontextualized the elections and popular acclamations still legally responsible for the elevation of new rulers. They were no longer understood as autonomous authorities but merely agents in service of God's will.{{sfnp|Lupoi|2000|p=252}} The [[divine right of kings|divine right]] of kings was thus gradually recreated in a Christian context, continuing even when monarchs might choose to forgo the anointment ceremony altogether. The supposedly indelible nature of anointment was alluded to in [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]'':
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;Not all the water in the rough rude sea
Can wash the balm off an anointed king.&lt;ref&gt;Shakespeare, William. ''Richard II'', II.ii.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

In [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]], the anointing of a new king is considered a [[Sacred Mystery]]. The act is believed to empower him—through the [[divine grace|grace]] of the [[Holy Spirit]]—with the ability to discharge his divinely appointed duties, particularly his [[Christian ministry|ministry]] in defending the faith. The same ''[[myrrh|myron]]'' used in [[Chrismation]] is used for the ceremony. In [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]] ceremonial, the anointing took place during the [[coronation of the Russian monarch|coronation of the tsar]] towards the end of the service, just before his receipt of [[Holy Communion]]. The sovereign and his consort were escorted to the [[Holy Doors]] ([[Iconostasis]]) of the cathedral and jointly anointed by the [[metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]]. Afterwards, the tsar was taken alone through the Holy Doors—an action normally reserved only for priests—and received communion at a small table set next to the [[Holy Table]].

In the present day, royal unction is less common, being practiced only upon the monarchs of [[Monarch of the United Kingdom|Britain]] and of [[Monarch of Tonga|Tonga]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} The utensils for the practice are sometimes reckoned as [[regalia]], like the [[ampulla]] and [[spoon]] used in the former [[Kingdom of France]] and the [[anointing horn]]s used in [[Kingdom of Sweden|Sweden]] and [[Kingdom of Norway|Norway]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} The Biblical formula is not necessarily followed. For the 1626 coronation of [[Charles I of England|King Charles&amp;nbsp;I]] of England, the holy oil was made of a concoction of [[Orange (fruit)|orange]], [[jasmine]], distilled roses, distilled [[cinnamon]], and [[ben oil]].

'''Answers in Genesis''' ('''AiG''') is a [[christian fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] Christian [[Christian apologetics|apologetics]] [[parachurch organization]]. It advocates a [[Biblical literalism|literal]] or [[Historical-grammatical method|historical-grammatical]] interpretation of the [[Book of Genesis]], with a particular focus on a pseudoscientific promotion of [[young Earth creationism]], which rejects those results of [[scientific investigation]] which do not conform to their literal interpretation of the [[Genesis creation narrative]]. The organization sees [[evolution]] as incompatible with the Bible and believes anything other than the young Earth view is a compromise on [[biblical inerrancy]].

AiG began as the Creation Science Foundation in 1980, following the merger of two Australian creationist groups. Its name changed to Answers in Genesis in 1994, when [[Ken Ham]] founded the organization's United States branch. In 2006 the branches in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and South Africa split from the US and UK to form [[Creation Ministries International]]. In 2007, AiG opened the [[Creation Museum]], a facility that promotes young Earth creationism, and in 2016 the organization opened the [[Ark Encounter]], a [[Noah's Ark]] themed amusement park. AiG also publishes websites, magazines, and journals.

==Organization==
{{creationism2}}
Answers in Genesis resulted from the merging of two Australian creationist organizations in 1980, one led by John Mackay and [[Ken Ham]] and the other by [[Carl Wieland]]. The organization later become known as Answers in Genesis. Following turmoil in 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncse.com/news/2007/06/answers-genesis-legal-turmoil-001080 |title=Answers in Genesis in legal turmoil |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=June 21, 2007 |publisher=[[National Center for Science Education]] |location=Berkeley, CA |accessdate=2008-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; the AiG network split in 2006. The US and UK branches retained the AiG name and control of the AiG website under Ham's leadership. The Australian, Canadian, New Zealand, and South African branches rebranded themselves as Creation Ministries International (CMI). In 2007, CMI filed suit against AiG-USA alleging a variety of wrongdoings, including publicly defaming their organization.&lt;ref name="McKenna_2007"&gt;{{cite news |last=McKenna |first=Michael |date=June 4, 2007 |title=Biblical battle of creation groups |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/biblical-battle-of-creation-groups/story-e6frg6nf-1111113672622 |newspaper=[[The Australian]] |location=Surry Hills, Australia |publisher=[[News Corp Australia]] |accessdate=2014-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2006, Answers in Genesis launched ''Answers'' magazine in the United States and United Kingdom, followed by the ''Answers Research Journal'' in 2008, which was widely criticized in the media&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Randerson |first=James |date=January 27, 2008 |title=God's journal |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2008/jan/27/godsjournal |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |type=Blog |location=London |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |accessdate=2014-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Goldstein |first=Bonnie |date=February 13, 2008 |title=Peer-Reviewing the Bible|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/hot_document/features/2008/peerreviewing_the_bible/_2.html |journal=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=[[Graham Holdings Company|The Washington Post Company]] |accessdate=2014-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and scientific circles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brumfiel |first=Geoff |date=January 23, 2008 |title=Creationists launch 'science' journal |url=http://www.nature.com/news/2008/080123/full/451382b.html |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |location=London |publisher=[[Nature Publishing Group]] |volume=451 |issue= |pages=382–383 |doi=10.1038/451382b |issn=0028-0836 |accessdate=2014-09-30 |pmid=18216813}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2006, the [[National Religious Broadcasters]] awarded Answers in Genesis their Best Ministry Website award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.nrb.org/press/2006awards.htm |title=NRB 2006 Media Award Winners |website=NRB Convention &amp; Exposition |publisher=[[National Religious Broadcasters]] |location=Manassas, VA |accessdate=2014-09-30|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060808183215/http://content.nrb.org/press/2006awards.htm|archivedate=8 August 2006|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2007, AiG launched the [[Creation Museum]] in the United States. The museum received criticism from the [[National Center for Science Education]] and petitions of protest from the scientific community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncse.com/news/2007/05/reactions-to-creation-museum-001073 |title=Reactions to creation 'museum' |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=May 25, 2007 |publisher=National Center for Science Education |location=Berkeley, CA |accessdate = 2008-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views and activities==
From the outset, [[Ken Ham]] did not share the interest of other [[creation science]] groups in aiming to produce science supporting [[young Earth creationism]],&lt;ref name="Trollinger"/&gt; instead Answers in Genesis presents evangelicalism as an all-out battle of their biblical [[world view|worldview]] against a [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistic]] scientific worldview.&lt;ref name="Fletcher"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fletcher|first1=John|title=Preaching to Convert: Evangelical Outreach and Performance Activism in a Secular Age|date=2013|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=9780472119158|page=193|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BZe4AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA193|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ham's message has had three central points. Firstly, teaching of [[evolution]] is an evil causing terrible damage to society, secondly, the [[Primeval history|first eleven chapters]] of the [[Book of Genesis]] give direct instruction on the creation of the universe and human social behavior, and thirdly that proper Christians must engage in a total conflict battling against [[atheism|atheistic]] [[humanism]]. Answers in Genesis promotes central young Earth creationist doctrines, including literal Creation of the Earth in six 24-hour days and [[Flood geology|effects of the global flood]], but their main focus is acceptance of the authority of their particular [[Biblical literalism|literal reading of the Bible]] as a precondition for eternity in heaven. They present this as a choice between the word of God and human reason, with those choosing the latter liable to dire eternal punishment.&lt;ref name="Trollinger"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Trollinger|first1=Susan L.|last2=Trollinger, Jr.|first2=William Vance|editor1-last=Gutjahr|editor1-first=Paul|title=The Oxford Handbook of the Bible in America|date=2017|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780190258856|pages=223-225|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=23o7DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA223|language=en|chapter=Chapter 31:The Bible and Creationism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Answers in Genesis rejects key scientific facts and theories as established by [[archeology]], [[cosmology]], [[geology]], [[paleontology]] and [[evolutionary biology]] and argues that the universe, the Earth and life originated about 6,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kennerly|first1=Britt|title=Paleontologists brought to tears, laughter by Creation Museum|url=https://phys.org/news/2009-06-paleontologists-brought-laughter-creation-museum.html|work=Phys.org|date=June 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bielo|first1=James S|editor1-last=Gutjahr|editor1-first=Paul|title=The Oxford Handbook of the Bible in America|date=2017|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780190258856|page=489|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=23o7DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA489|language=en|chapter=Chapter 31:Performing the Bible}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ohehir|first1=Andrew|title=Archaeology from the dark side|url=https://www.salon.com/2005/08/31/archaeology/|work=Salon|date=31 August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since their beliefs reject [[Naturalism (philosophy)#Methodological naturalism|natural causes and events in scientific explanations]] of nature and the origin of the universe in favor of the [[supernatural]], creation science is considered to be a religion by the National Academy of Sciences.&lt;ref&gt;[[#NAS 1999|NAS 1999]], [http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=6024&amp;page=R9 p. R9]&lt;/ref&gt; 

A book published by one of AiG's employees in 2006 accused [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] of using subtle tactics to slip "evolutionary content" into ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'', ''[[Lilo &amp; Stitch]]'' and ''[[Finding Nemo]]'', affirming that "As Christians we need to reflect the Bible's standards and not Hollywood's perverted version of reality."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kerby 2006|Kerby 2006]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=yZjtCxxUk4AC&amp;pg=PT10 pp. 9–10]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creation Museum===
{{main article|Creation Museum}}
[[File:AIG museum.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Creation Museum]]]]
AiG's Creation Museum is a museum displaying a [[Young Earth creationism|Young Earth creationist]] worldview and [[pseudoarchaeology]]. The facility has received much criticism from the scientific and religious communities, as well as cultural commentators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Jarman |first=Josh |date=May 25, 2007 |title=Creating a stir |url=http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/faith_and_values/2007/05/25/creation.ART_ART_05-25-07_B6_5J6Q39G.html |newspaper=[[The Columbus Dispatch]] |location=Columbus, OH |publisher=Dispatch Printing Company |accessdate=2014-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lovan |first=Dylan T. |date=May 19, 2007 |title=Educators question Creation Museum |url=http://chronicle.augusta.com/stories/2007/05/19/met_129149.shtml |newspaper=[[The Augusta Chronicle]] |location=Augusta, GA |agency=[[Associated Press]] |accessdate=2014-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Creation Museum opened May 27, 2007, at a cost of $27 million raised entirely by private donations. The displays were created by Patrick Marsh, known for work on [[Universal Studios Florida]] attractions for [[Kongfrontation|King Kong]] and [[Jaws (ride)|Jaws]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rothstein |first=Edward |authorlink=Edward Rothstein |title=Adam and Eve in the Land of the Dinosaurs |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/24/arts/24crea.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |type=Museum review |date=May 24, 2007 |accessdate=2008-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[A. A. Gill]], a British writer and critic, described the museum as "battling science and reason since 2007", writing: "This place doesn't just take on evolution—it squares off with geology, anthropology, paleontology, history, chemistry, astronomy, zoology, biology, and good taste. It directly and boldly contradicts most -onomies and all -ologies, including most theology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gill |first=A. A. |authorlink=A. A.

==Criticism==

[[Creation science]], which is promoted by AiG, is a pseudoscience that "lacks the central defining characteristic of all modern scientific theories".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Albert|first1=Leon|title="Scientific" Creationism as a Pseudoscience|journal=Creation Evolution Journal|volume=6|issue=2|page=27|url=https://ncse.com/cej/6/2/scientific-creationism-as-pseudoscience}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ruse|first1=Michael|title=Creation Science is not Science|journal=Science and Technology|date=15 July 1982|volume=7|pages=10–18|doi=10.1177/016224398200700313}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gordin|first1=Michael D.|title=The Pseudoscience Wars: Immanuel Velikovsky and the Birth of the Modern Fringe|date=2012|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226304434|page=137|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZL5iSDWts0kC&amp;pg=PA137|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientific and scholarly organizations, including the [[National Academy of Sciences]], [[Paleontological Society]], [[Geological Society of America]], [[Australian Academy of Science]], and the [[Royal Society of Canada]] have issued statements against the teaching of creationism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncse.com/media/voices/science |title=Statements from Scientific and Scholarly Organizations |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |publisher=National Center for Science Education |location=Berkeley, CA |accessdate=2008-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Center for Science Education, a science advocacy group, criticize AiG's promotion of non-science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncse.com/taking-action/project-steve |title=Project Steve |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=October 17, 2008 |publisher=National Center for Science Education |location=Berkeley, CA |accessdate=2008-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Scott |first=Eugenie C. |authorlink=Eugenie Scott |date=January–February 1997 |title=Anti-evolutionists Form, Fund Think Tank |url=http://ncse.com/rncse/17/1/anti-evolutionists-form-fund-think-tank |journal=Reports of the National Center for Science Education |location=Berkeley, CA |publisher=National Center for Science Education |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=25–26 |issn=2158-818X |accessdate=2008-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncse.com/creationism/general/pbss-evolution-creationist-backlash |title=PBS's "Evolution": The Creationist Backlash |last=Branch |first=Glenn |authorlink=Glenn Branch |date=September 1, 2001 |publisher=National Center for Science Education |location=Berkeley, CA |format=PDF |accessdate=2014-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In direct response to AiG, [[No Answers in Genesis]] is a website maintained by members of the [[Australian Skeptics]] and retired civil servant John Stear for the purpose of rebutting claims made by AiG.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.noanswersingenesis.org.au/ |title=No Answers in Genesis! |website=No Answers in Genesis |publisher=[[Australian Skeptics|Australian Skeptics Science and Education Foundation]] |accessdate=2008-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==

===Richard Dawkins interview===
In 1998, Answers in Genesis filmed an interview with [[Richard Dawkins]], a prominent evolutionary biologist at [[Oxford University]], resulting in a controversial video that AiG posted on its website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/2004/08/publicintellectualspoll/ |title=Public Intellectuals Poll |accessdate=9 March 2008 |last=Herman |first=David |year=2004 |work=Prospect}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dawkins addressed it in the essay: "The 'Information Challenge'", published in ''[[A Devil's Chaplain]]'' in 2003. The "suspiciously amateurish" interview included, according to Dawkins, "the kind of question only a creationist would ask in that way" (namely, to "give an example of a genetic mutation or an evolutionary process which can be seen to increase the information in the genome"). Realising that he had been duped, Dawkins, at his own admission, was angry at the thought and initially refused to answer the question, but relented and continued the interview. Dawkins wrote: "My generosity was rewarded in a fashion that anyone familiar with fundamentalist tactics might have predicted. When I eventually saw the film a year later, I found that it had been edited to give the false impression that I was incapable of answering the question about information content. In fairness, this may not have been quite as intentionally deceitful as it sounds. You have to understand that these people really believe that their question cannot be answered!"{{sfn|Dawkins|2003|loc=[http://www.skeptics.com.au/publications/articles/the-information-challenge/ p. 91]|ps=}}

The Australian Skeptics wrote that the film was edited to give the appearance that Dawkins was unable to "give an example of a genetic mutation or an evolutionary process which can be seen to increase the information in the genome" and that a segment that shows him pausing for 11 seconds was film of him considering whether to expel the interviewer from the room for not revealing her creationist sympathies at the outset. Dawkins reported to the Australian Skeptics that the interviewer shown in the finished film was not the same person as the person who had originally asked the questions. Dawkins and Barry Williams also said that the question had been subsequently changed to make it look like Dawkins, who was answering the original question put to him, was unable to answer.&lt;ref name="ASkeptics"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Williams |first=Barry |year=1998 |title=Creationist Deception Exposed |url=http://www.skeptics.com.au/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/magazine/The%20Skeptic%20Volume%2018%20%281998%29%20No%203.pdf |format=PDF |journal=The Skeptic |location=Sydney |publisher=[[Australian Skeptics]] |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=7–10 |issn=0726-9897 |accessdate=2014-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dawkins discussed the interview in the essay published in ''[[A Devil's Chaplain]]''.{{sfn|Dawkins|2003|loc=[http://www.skeptics.com.au/publications/articles/the-information-challenge/ p. 91]|ps=}}

===Legal action by Creation Ministries Int'l===
On May 31, 2007, Creation Ministries International filed a lawsuit in [[Supreme Court of Queensland]] against Ken Ham and Answers in Genesis seeking damages and accusing him of "unbiblical/unethical/unlawful behaviour" in his dealings with the Australian organization.&lt;ref name="McKenna_2007" /&gt; Prior to the split, the Australian group had been producing periodicals, ''Creation'' magazine and ''Journal of Creation'', which were then distributed within other countries by local groups. The Australian group had no access to the list of subscribers in the US. AiG discontinued the distribution arrangement, and produced a new magazine of their own, called ''Answers'', and represented that to subscribers as a replacement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |url=http://www.christianfaithandreason.com/june_creationmag.html |title=Fellow Christians Aggrieved by Business Practices of Ken Ham and Answers in Genesis |journal=Christian Faith and Reason Magazine |location=Spring Hill, TN |publisher=Guerrilla Enterprise Management, Inc. |date=May 27, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070627030651/http://www.christianfaithandreason.com/june_creationmag.html |archivedate=2007-06-27 |accessdate=2014-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creation Ministries International was claiming $252,000 (US) in damages for lost revenue by misleading and deceptive conduct in relating to lost subscriptions.&lt;ref name="legalclaim"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.creationontheweb.biz/statement-of-claim.pdf |title=Statement of Claim (4690/07 Supreme Court of Brisbane) |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513052009/http://www.creationontheweb.biz/statement-of-claim.pdf |archivedate=2008-05-13 |accessdate=2007-07-18}} Photocopy supplied at the CMI website; official court file summary [http://apps.courts.qld.gov.au/esearching/FileDetails.aspx?Location=BRISB&amp;Court=SUPRE&amp;Filenumber=4690/07 here].&lt;/ref&gt;

In comments to news reporters, Ken Ham dismisses CMI's accusations as "totally preposterous and untrue".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Mead |first1=Andy |last2=Farrar |first2=Lu-Ann |date=June 17, 2007 |title=Museum group sued by fellow creationists |url=http://www.kentucky.com/news/state/story/100183.html |newspaper=Lexington Herald-Leader |location=Sacramento, CA |publisher=The McClatchy Company |page=A1 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070620155007/http://www.kentucky.com/news/state/story/100183.html |archivedate=2007-06-20 |accessdate=2014-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creation Ministries has made a large collection of documents available detailing their side of the case. An editorial analysis of the situation, including reference to estranged co-founder John Mackay's allegations in 1986 of necrophilia and witchcraft against Ken Ham's personal secretary is offered in an account in the ''Reports of the National Center for Science Education''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lippard |first=Jim  |authorlink=Jim Lippard |date=November–December 2006 |title=Trouble in Paradise: Answers in Genesis Splinters |url=http://ncse.com/rncse/26/6/trouble-paradise |journal=Reports of the National Center for Science Education |location=Berkeley, CA |publisher=National Center for Science Education |volume=26 |issue=6 |pages=4–7 |issn=2158-818X |accessdate=2014-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2009, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit]] ordered Australian-based Creation Ministries International into arbitration with Answers in Genesis over copyrights and control of affiliates in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lovan |first=Dylan T. |date=February 14, 2009 |title=Court: Creationists should settle outside court |url=http://www.etaiwannews.com/etn/news_content.php?id=865750&amp;lang=eng_news |newspaper=[[Taiwan News]] |location=Taipei |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=2008-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2009, the ministries reached a settlement and ended their dispute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://creation.com/dispute-settled |title=dispute-settled |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=Creation.com |publisher=Creation Ministries International |accessdate=2014-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-atheism billboards===
In the spring of 2009, Answers in Genesis posted a billboard in Texas with a young boy aiming a gun towards the camera with the words "If God doesn't matter to him, do you?" The same image was used in a TV ad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://crooksandliars.com/nicole-belle/christianist-groups-billboard-compare |title=Christianist Group's Billboard Compares Atheism To Murder |last=Belle |first=Nicole |date=June 2, 2009 |website=[[Crooks and Liars]] |type=Blog |accessdate=2014-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the organization purchased space in [[Times Square]] to run a 15-second video advertisement addressed "To all of our intolerant liberal friends". According to AiG, the goal of the billboard was to "challenge the secularists who are increasingly intolerant of the Christian message". The Christian ''[[Relevant Magazine]]'' described the ad as "passive-aggressive" and "weirdly combative".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.relevantmagazine.com/slices/heres-controversial-billboard-answers-genesis-displaying-times-square-tonight Here's the Controversial Billboard 'Answers in Genesis' Is Displaying in Times Square Tonight], ''[[Relevant Magazine]]'', 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Great Homeschool Conventions===
In March 2011, the Board of Great Homeschool Conventions, Inc. (a young Earth Christian group) voted to disinvite Ken Ham and AiG from future conventions due to Ham's words about other Christians making "unnecessary, ungodly, and mean-spirited statements that are divisive at best and defamatory at worst". The controversy stemmed from Ham's commentary on the position expressed by [[Peter Enns]], of [[The BioLogos Foundation]], who advocated a symbolic, rather than literal interpretation of the fall of Adam and Eve. Writing on his blog, Ham accused Enns of espousing "outright liberal theology that totally undermines the authority of the Word of God", which led to his invitation being revoked.&lt;ref name="BannedfromConvention"&gt;{{cite news |last=Blackford |first=Linda B. |date=March 24, 2011 |title=Founder of Creation Museum banned from convention |url=http://www.kentucky.com/news/state/kentucky/article44085801.html |newspaper=Lexington Herald-Leader |location=Sacramento, CA |publisher=The McClatchy Company |accessdate=2014-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Workforce==
In 2007 about 160 people including a [[chaplain]] worked at the Creation Museum (a division of AiG, so these were AiG employees) and another 140 people worked at the attached AiG headquarters.&lt;ref name="Slevin"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Slevin|first1=Peter|title=A Monument  To Creation|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/26/AR2007052600908.html|work=The Washington Post|date=27 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vindy"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Associated Press|title=Museum merges God, science|url=http://www.vindy.com/content/national_world/358296894445314.php/|work=Vindy.com|date=May 26, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926224204/http://www.vindy.com/content/national_world/358296894445314.php/|archivedate=September 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Coexist"&gt;"[http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=176926 Dinosaurs, humans coexist in creationist museum]".

These include "Scripture teaches a recent origin for man and the whole creation", "the only legitimate marriage is the joining of one man and one woman", "the [[Noah's Ark|great Flood of Genesis]] was an actual historic event" and "no apparent, perceived or claimed evidence in any field, including history and chronology, can be valid if it contradicts the Scriptural record".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answersingenesis.org/about/faith Summary of the AiG Statement of Faith].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2487">'''Aurva''' is a fierce sage descending in order from [[Vishnu]], [[Brahma]], [[Bhrigu]], [[Chyavana]], Apnuvana. He was born during a bloody feud between the [[Kshatriya]]s and the descendants of Bhrigu. He was the grandson of [[Vatsa]], after whom the [[Srivatsa]] gotra is named. His son was Ṛchika and Ṛchika’s son was [[Jamadagni]].&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedic Dictionary of Puranas|date=2001|volume=1|publisher=Sarup &amp; Sons|isbn=9788176252263|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6F0ZIBIL2ZAC|page=130|accessdate=2014-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=India Through the Ages|last=Gopal|first=Madan|year= 1990| page= 73|editor=K.S.

Aurava/Aurva  is the son of Rishi Apnuvana and grandson of Rishi Chyavana. He is also called as the grandson of Rishi Vatsa.  Aurava's son is named as Ruchika. Articles on Bhrigus, Chyavana,and Ruchika are available in Wikipedia. There is an interesting episode regarding the birth of Aurava  and as to why he was called Aurava. According to the Mahabharata there was a king named   Kritavirya  Who was   very liberal  to his  priests,  who belonged to the race of Bhrigu. As such they became very rich due to his generosity. But after the death of the king his descendants had fallen into poverty.  They begged for help from the Bhrigus, who at that time were very rich. But the Bhrigus  refused to help the kings saying that the wealth which is once given to a Brahman cannot be taken back. To protect their wealth they buried their gold in a secret place. Coming to know about this the Kshatriya kings invaded the Ashrams of the Bhrigus  and killed all the Bhrigus, without sparing even children that were growing in the wombs of their  mothers.. The Bhrigus  also belonged to a warrior class once, but they could not stop the kings from slaughtering them. One woman concealed her just born son in her thighs to protect the baby from being slaughtered. The Kshatriyas who came to know about this rushed towards the lady to kill the baby.  The baby fell down from her thighs with such a luster  that all the persecutors were blinded instantly. Since the child was produced from the ‘Uru’(thigh)  of a  woman he was called  ‘ Aurava’/Aurva.&lt;ref&gt;WWW.yagnavenkatramaganapadigal-vamsavali.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early days==

===Far East===
The [[Bahá'í Faith]] entered the region of the [[Far East]], in [[Hong Kong]], in the 1870s, during the lifetime of [[Bahá'u'lláh]], the founder of the Bahá'í Faith.&lt;ref name="hk"/&gt; While the religion continued to enter other nearby regions to Taiwan &amp;mdash; Bahá'ís being in [[Shanghai]] in 1902,&lt;ref name="hassal-china"&gt;{{cite web

===Beginning in Taiwan===
Four Bahá'ís arrived in Taiwan in 1949 as part of the wave of refugees of [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s retreat from the mainland: Jerone Chu, Yan Hsu-chang, Chien Tien-lee, and Gellan Wang. The first Bahá'í in Taiwan&lt;ref name="brsims"/&gt; was Jerome Chu (Chu Yao-lung), a newspaper man, who had become a Bahá'í in [[Washington D.C.]] in 1945. Chu arrived in Taiwan after a stay in [[Nanking]] where an associate, Yuan Hsu-chang, had accepted the religion and also came to Taiwan. Major Chien Tien-lee (Lee L.T. Chang) had had a Bahá'í marriage ceremony in Denver, Colorado, U.S.A. and came to Taiwan after a stay in Shanghai.

The first American Bahá'í visitors to Taiwan were Dr. David Earl and Lt. Col. John McHenry in 1952, and Rafi and Mildred Mottahedeh in 1953. In October of that year [[Dhikru'llah Khadem]] visited Taiwan, the first [[Hand of the Cause]] &amp;mdash; people who achieved a distinguished rank in service to the religion &amp;mdash; to do so and at a meeting he held in Chu's home three more people accepted the Bahá'í Faith: these three were Professor Tsao Li-shih, who was an instructor of architecture at the College of Engineering at the [[National Taiwan University]]; Hong Li-ming (Jimmy), the first native-born Taiwanese to become a Bahá'í; and Wong Ho-len (Wong Ho-jen).&lt;ref name="hassal-china"/&gt;

Later, Mr. and Mrs. Suleimani, who were Bahá'ís in Shanghai, left that city in 1950,&lt;ref name="xviii"&gt;{{Cite book  | author = Universal House of Justice | title = In Memoriam | journal = The Bahá'í World | volume = XVIII | publisher = Bahá'í World Centre | pages = Table of Contents and pp.619, 632, 802–4 | year = 1986 | url = http://bahai-library.com/books/bw18/748-772.html | isbn = 0-85398-234-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and arrived in Taiwan in 1954 at port [[Keelung]]&lt;ref name="sulay"&gt;{{Cite news | last = International Community | first = Bahá'í | author-link = Bahá'í International Community | title = Attractive center holds fond memories | newspaper = Bahá'í World News Service | date = 2004-12-16 | url = http://news.bahai.org/story/339}}&lt;/ref&gt; where they found there was already a community of ten Bahá'ís spread among some of the cities of Taiwan: Taipei (2), Tainan (4), [[Taoyuan City|Taoyuan]], [[Kaohsiung]] and [[Chiayi]].  Mrs. Suleimani was from a Bahá'í family from [[Bahá'í Faith in Turkmenistan|Ashqabad]] who left in 1923.&lt;ref name="hassal-china"/&gt;

==Growth==
By May 1955 there were eighteen Bahá'ís in six localities across Taiwan. The first Bahá'í [[Local Spiritual Assembly]] in Taiwan was elected in Tainan in 1956,&lt;ref name="brsims"/&gt; which was noted by [[Shoghi Effendi]], then head of the religion.  The members were Mr. Wang Chi-chang, Mrs. Suleimani, Mr. Pai Chung-chen, Mrs. Ruthy Tu, Mr. Tsao Li-shih. Standing. Dr. Ni Jun-chung (ching),  Mr. Chu, Mr. Winston Luk, and Mr. Ho Chung-tzu. Mrs. Tu was the first woman citizen of Taiwan to become a Bahá'í and was elected to be a delegate in 1957 to the election of the regional [[National Spiritual Assembly]] but was unable to travel. Noted Bahá'í [[Agnes Alexander]] visited the island in 1956, and, after being appointed as a Hand of the Cause, visited the island again in 1958 and 1962.

From 1955 through 1957, petitions by the Bahá'í community were submitted to the Taiwanese government to be recognized as a religion by the government had failed, though permission was given to have a temporary Bahá'í summer school in September 1957.&lt;ref name="brsims"/&gt;

In 1957, the first regional National Assembly election convention of the Bahá'ís of North East Asia, held in Tokyo, was convened; the jurisdiction of the National Assembly included Taiwan.&lt;ref name="brsims"/&gt; In 1958, the second Local Spiritual Assembly of the island was established in [[Taipei]] with the arrival of two pioneers and one more citizen convert. By April 1958 the number of Bahá'ís in Taiwan had reached twenty-two. The first official use of the Tainan Bahá'í Centre was in 1959.  In 1960 the book [[John Esslemont#Publications|Bahá'u'lláh and the New Era]] was revised, translated and reprinted and one copy was given to every Bahá'í in Taiwan. In 1963 Mrs. Tu was able to attend the first [[Bahá'í World Congress]] which also the year of the first Bahá'í marriage ceremony in Taiwan.

The first Bahá'í National Spiritual Assembly of Taiwan was first elected in 1967 &amp;mdash; the members of the institution were&lt;ref name="brsims"/&gt; Mrs. Isabel Dean and Mrs. Ridvaniyyih Suleimani,  Mr. Kuo Rong-hui, Mr. Robert Yen, Dr. Sidney Dean, Mr. S.A. Suleimani, Mr. Tsao Kai-min, Mr. Huang Tsen-min and Mr. Huang Ting-seng. At the time there were local assemblies in Taipei, Tainan, Hualien, and Pingtung. Then in 1970 the Bahá'í community of the island was recognized by the government.

In 1990, the Chief of the indigenous [[Puyuma people|Puyuma]] Tribe, Mr. Chen Wen-sheng, became a Bahá'í.&lt;ref name="brsims"/&gt;

Worldwide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bahá'í socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. In more recent years the Bahá'ís of Taiwan have participated in a number of local and international activities. By 1995, the Bahá'í Office of the Environment for Taiwan, in collaboration with the national government, had trained hundreds of teachers throughout the country to introduce conservation issues into curricula. The Office also produced a series of national radio educational programs on environmental care and protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

'''Bilocation''', or sometimes '''multilocation''', is an alleged [[psychic ability|psychic]] or [[miracles|miraculous]] ability wherein an individual or object is located (or appears to be located) in two distinct places at the same time.&lt;ref name="Nickell 1993"&gt;[[Joe Nickell|Nickell, Joe]].

==In religion and mysticism==
[[File:Sant'Alfonso Liguori.jpg|thumb|right|Several religious figures have historically claimed to have bilocated. In 1774, [[St. Alphonsus Liguori]] claimed to have gone into a trance while preparing for Mass. When he came out of the trance he said that he had visited the bedside of the dying [[Pope Clement XIV]].{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}]]

Several [[Christian]] [[saint]]s, [[monk]]s and [[Muslim]] [[sufi]]s are said to have exhibited bilocation.  Among the earliest is the apparition of [[Our Lady of the Pillar]] in the year 40. St [[Isidore the Farmer]] claimed to be praying or attending to Mass in Church while at the same time plowing in the fields.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Other Christian figures said to have experienced bilocation include St. [[Alphonsus Marie De'Liguori]] (Founder of Redemptorist Congregation), [[Anthony of Padua|St. Anthony of Padua]], [[Ursula Micaela Morata]], [[Gerard Majella|St. Gerard Majella]], [[Charles of Mount Argus]], [[Pio of Pietrelcina|Padre Pio]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last= Day| first= Malcolm| title= Blood brother: Padre Pio| url= http://www.forteantimes.com/features/articles/228/blood_brother_padre_pio.html| journal= Fortean Times| date= September 2002| postscript= &lt;!--None--&gt;| deadurl= yes| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090203170134/http://www.forteantimes.com/features/articles/228/blood_brother_padre_pio.html| archivedate= 2009-02-03| df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Severus of Ravenna|St. Severus of Ravenna]], [[Ambrose|St. Ambrose of Milan]], [[María de Ágreda]],&lt;ref&gt;This holy virgin burned with a most ardent love for God and for the salvation of souls. One day, she beheld in a vision all the nations of the world. She saw the greater part of men were deprived of God's grace, and running headlong to everlasting perdition. She saw how the Indians of Mexico put fewer obstacles to the grace of conversion than any other nation who were out of the Catholic Church, and how God, on this account, was ready to show mercy to them. Hence she redoubled her prayers and penances to obtain for them the grace of conversion. God heard her prayers. He commanded her to teach the Catholic religion to those Mexican Indians. From that time, she appeared, by way of '''bilocation''', to the savages, not less than five hundred times, instructing them in all the truths of our holy religion, and performing miracles in confirmation of these truths. When all were converted to the faith, she told them that religious priests would be sent by God to receive them into the Church by baptism. As she had told, so it happened. God, in his mercy, sent to these good Indians several Franciscan fathers, who were greatly astonished when they found those savages fully instructed in the Catholic doctrine. When they asked the Indians who had instructed them, they were told that a holy virgin appeared among them many times, and taught them the Catholic religion and confirmed it by miracles. (Life of the Venerable Mary of Jesus of Agreda, § xii.) Thus those good Indians were brought miraculously to the knowledge of the true religion in the Catholic Church,'' because they followed their conscience in observing the natural law''. Muller, Michael. [http://www.traditionalcatholic.net/Tradition/Information/The_Catholic_Dogma/Contents.html The Catholic Dogma: "Extra Ecclesiam Nullus omnino Salvatur"]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Martin de Porres|St. Martin de Porres]], and [[María de León Bello y Delgado]].

In the [[Coptic Church]], Saints [[Yostos El Antony]] and [[Pope Cyril VI of Alexandria]] were claimed to bilocate in the [[20th century]].{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

==Witchcraft==
In the 17th century, persons accused of witchcraft were reported to appear in dreams and visions of witnesses. The trials at [[Bury St. Edmunds witch trials|Bury St. Edmunds]] and [[Salem witch trials|Salem]] included this "[[spectral evidence]]" against defendants. [[Matthew Hopkins]] described the phenomenon in his book ''The Discovery of Witches''.

==Modern==
The English occultist [[Aleister Crowley]] was reported by acquaintances to have the ability, even though he said he was not conscious of its happening at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Booth, Martin (2000) "A Magick Life: Biography of Aleister Crowley", Hodder &amp; Stoughton Ltd, {{ISBN|0-340-71805-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bilocation figures heavily in [[David Lynch]]'s film ''[[Lost Highway (film)|Lost Highway]]'' (1997) and  [[Thomas Pynchon]]'s novel ''[[Against the Day]]'' (2006). Bilocation also plays a part in the Christopher Priest novel ''The Prestige''.

A mystical story that involved Soviet author [[Yevgeny Petrov (writer)|Yevgeny Petrov]] served as inspiration for the film ''[[Envelope (film)|Envelope]]'' (2012) starring [[Kevin Spacey]].

==Skepticism==

Skeptical investigator [[Joe Nickell]] has written that there is no scientific evidence that bilocation is a real phenomenon and that cases are often from anecdotal reports that cannot be verified. Nickell listed self-[[delusion]], [[hoax]]ing and [[illusion]] to explain alleged cases of bilocation.&lt;ref name="Nickell 1993"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2664">'''Dao-xuan''' ({{zh | c=道璿| p=Dào Xuán| w=Tao Hsüan| first=t}}, 702-760) or ''Dōsen'' in Japanese was a prominent Chinese monk in early [[Japanese Buddhism]], responsible for importing Northern School [[Chinese Chán|Chan]] teachings, [[Huayan school]] teachings and the [[Bodhisattva Precepts]] to Japan in 736.  He also served as the {{nihongo|''Risshi''|律師||"precept master"}} for ordination prior to the arrival of [[Ganjin]], and presided over the opening of the [[Tōdai-ji]] Temple.&lt;ref name="takemitsu"&gt;{{cite book|last=武光|first=誠|script-title=ja:知っておきたい日本の仏教|publisher=角川学芸出版|isbn=4044057028|pages=42–43|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dao-xuan was born in [[Hunan]] Province in 702, and ordained at an early age in the [[Vinaya]] school in China (律宗) at Dafu (大福) temple in [[Loyang]]. After learning the Vinaya, he traveled and practiced Chan meditation for a time followed by intensive study of [[Tiantai]] doctrines before returning to his home temple where he hosted lectures.

In 733, two Japanese monks, Eiei (栄叡) and Fushō (普照) came to China in search of a Vinaya master who would accompany them to Japan to provide orthodox Buddhist ordinations there.&lt;ref name="groner"&gt;{{cite book|last=Groner|first=Paul|title=The Establishment of the Japanese Tendai School|year=2000|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=0824823710|pages=22–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dao-xuan agreed to go, and arrived in 736.  However, the rules of the Vinaya state that a minimum of 10 ''[[bhikkhu]]'' monks was required for new ordinations, and so Dao-xuan was unable to conduct an ordination service until 754 when [[Ganjin]] and his disciples arrived in Japan.&lt;ref name="groner" /&gt;

In the meantime, Dao-xuan had brought the latest Buddhist teachings from China and lectured actively on such topics as the [[Brahmajala Sutra (Mahayana)|Brahma Net Sutra]] and the precepts.&lt;ref name="groner" /&gt;  Dao-xuan's lectures on the [[Flower Garland Sutra]] and his knowledge of Huayan School teachings inspired [[Emperor Shomu]] to construct the Tōdai-ji temple as the center for further studies of the Huayan school.&lt;ref name="takemitsu" /&gt; It is also recorded that he chanted ''[[dharani]]'' during the opening ceremony of the Great Buddha at Tōdai-ji temple.  In 751, he was appointed as "precept master", and greeted Ganjin upon arrival as well as Bodhisena.

By 760, his health declined and he was forced to withdraw to Hisodera temple in [[Yoshino Province]], where he died.

The '''European Jewish Parliament''' or '''EJP''' (formerly known as '''European Jewish Union''' or '''EJU''') is a [[non-governmental organization]] (NGO) based in [[Brussels]] whose stated aim is to be "a uniting structure for all Jewish communities and organizations throughout Western, Eastern and Central Europe."&lt;ref&gt;

The EJU-backed EJP is the brainchild of Ukrainian billionaire [[Vadim Rabinovich]].

==European Jewish Union==
The EJU group was founded in the Spring of 2011 by [[Ihor Kolomoyskyi]] and [[Vadim Rabinovich]] 

The EJU hoped to establish a European Jewish Parliament, comprising 120 members modeled on the Israeli [[Knesset]].&lt;ref name=INN&gt;

'''Freedom of religion in China''' is provided for in the ''[[Constitution of the People's Republic of China]]'',&lt;ref name="constitution"&gt;[[Constitution of China]], Chapter 2, Article 36.&lt;/ref&gt; with an important caveat: the government protects what it calls "normal religious activity," defined in practice as activities that take place within government-sanctioned religious organizations and registered places of worship. Although the dynastic governments of imperial China also claimed responsibility for [[Religion in China|the practice of religion]], human rights bodies such as United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) have criticized this differentiation as falling short of international standards for the protection of religious freedom.&lt;ref name="CECC2011"&gt;Congressional-Executive Commission on China, [https://web.archive.org/web/20130213223223/http://www.cecc.gov/pages/annualRpt/annualRpt11/AR2011final.pdf Annual Report 2011], Oct 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[China]]'s five officially sanctioned religious organizations are the [[Buddhist Association of China]], [[Chinese Taoist Association]], [[Islamic Association of China]], [[Three-Self Patriotic Movement]] and [[Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association]]. These groups are afforded a degree of protection, but are subject to restrictions and controls under the [[State Administration for Religious Affairs]]. Unregistered religious groups—including [[Chinese house church|house churches]], [[Falun Gong]], [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhists]], underground [[Catholics]], and [[Uyghur people|Uyghur]] Muslims—face varying degrees of harassment, including imprisonment, torture, and [[forced conversion|forced religious conversion]].&lt;ref name="CECC2011" /&gt; Tam and Hasmath argue that the Chinese government views religion as potentially destabilizing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tam |first=Jonathan |last2=Hasmath |first2=Reza |year = 2015 |title=Navigating Uncertainty: The Survival Strategies of Religious NGOs in China |url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17448689.2015.1061261 |journal=Journal of Civil Society |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=283–299 |doi = 10.1080/17448689.2015.1061261 |issn=1744-8689 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal framework ==
(See also [[s:Regulations on Religious Affairs (PRC)|Regulations on Religious Affairs(PRC)]] and article [[Chinese Laws on Religious Activities]])

Article 36 of the [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China]] of 1982 specifies that:
{{Block quote|Citizens of the People's Republic of China enjoy freedom of religious belief. No state organ, public organization or individual may compel citizens to believe in, or not to believe in, any religion; nor may they discriminate against citizens who believe in, or do not believe in, any religion. The state protects normal religious activities. No one may make use of religion to engage in activities that disrupt public order, impair the health of citizens or interfere with the educational system of the state. Religious bodies and religious affairs are not subject to any foreign domination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.people.cn/constitution/constitution.html English translation of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China of 1982] (page visited on 20 February 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This protection is extended only to what are called "normal religious activities," generally understood to refer to religions that submit to state control via the State Administration for Religious Affairs.&lt;ref name=IRFR2010/&gt;  The Constitution further forbids the use of religion to "engage in activities that disrupt social order, impair the health of citizens or interfere with the educational system of the state. Religious organizations and religious affairs are not subject to any foreign dominance.”&lt;ref name="constitution" /&gt;

The law affords protection to five officially sanctioned religions: the [[Buddhist Association of China]], [[Chinese Taoist Association]], [[Islamic Association of China]], [[Three-Self Patriotic Movement]] and [[Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association]]. Religious groups are required to register with the State Administration for Religious Affairs (SARA, formerly known as the central Religious Affairs Bureau) or its provincial and local offices (still known as Religious Affairs Bureaus (RABs)). SARA and the RABs are responsible for monitoring and judging the legitimacy of religious activity.

Proselytizing is only permitted in private settings or within registered houses of worship. Proselytization in public, in unregistered churches or temples, or by foreigners is prohibited.&lt;ref name="IRFR2010" /&gt; Members of the officially atheist [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]] are strongly discouraged from holding religious faith.&lt;ref&gt;Xinhua News Agency, [http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90785/7681240.html 'CPC members shall not believe in religion: senior official'], 19 Dec 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant number of non-sanctioned churches and temples exist, attended by locals and foreigners alike. Unregistered or underground churches are not officially banned, but are not permitted to openly conduct religious services. These bodies may face varying degrees of interference, harassment, and persecution by state and party organs. In some instances, unregistered religious believers and leaders have been charged with "illegal religious activities" or "disrupting social stability."&lt;ref name=IRFR2010/&gt; Religious believers have also been charged under article 300 of the criminal code, which forbids using heretical organizations to "undermine the implementation of the law."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa17/011/2000/en/|title=China: The crackdown on Falun Gong and other so-called 'heretical organizations'|date=23 March 2000|publisher=Amnesty International|accessdate=17 March 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An extrajudicial, Communist Party-led security organ called the [[6-10 Office]] oversees the suppression of Falun Gong and, increasingly, other unregistered religious organizations.&lt;ref name=Jamestown&gt;Sarah Cook and Leeshai Lemish, [http://www.jamestown.org/programs/chinabrief/single/?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=38411&amp;cHash=2dff246d80ffd78112de97e280ce9725 ‘The 610 Office:Policing the Chinese Spirit’], China Brief , Volume 11 Issue 17 (9 November 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CECC2009&gt;Congressional-Executive Commission on China, [http://www.cecc.gov/pages/annualRpt/annualRpt09/CECCannRpt2009.pdf  ‘Annual Report 2009’] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091103235417/http://www.cecc.gov/pages/annualRpt/annualRpt09/CECCannRpt2009.pdf |date=November 3, 2009 }},  10 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Folk religions, though not officially protected, are sometimes tolerated by authorities. The State Administration for Religious Affairs has created a department to oversee the management of folk religion.&lt;ref&gt;United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, [http://www.uscirf.gov/images/book%20with%20cover%20for%20web.pdf Annual Report 2011] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111023101604/http://uscirf.gov/images/book%20with%20cover%20for%20web.pdf |date=2011-10-23 }}, May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christianity==
{{Main|Christianity in China}}
Christianity has had a presence in China dating as far back as the [[Tang dynasty]], and accumulated a following in China with the arrival of large numbers of missionaries during the [[Qing dynasty]]. Missionaries were expelled from China in 1949 when the Communist Party came to power, and the religion was associated with Western imperialism.  However, Christianity experienced a resurgence of popularity since the reforms under [[Deng Xiaoping]] in the late 1970s and 1980s.  By 2011, approximately 60 million Chinese citizens were estimated to be practicing Protestantism or Catholicism. The majority of these do not belong to the state-sanctioned churches.&lt;ref name="Gardam"&gt;Tim Gardam, [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-14838749 Christians in China: Is the country in spiritual crisis?] BBC, 11 Sept 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious practices are still often tightly controlled by government authorities. Chinese children in Mainland China are permitted to be involved with officially sanctioned Christian meetings through the [[Three-Self Patriotic Movement]] or the [[Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association]]s. In early January 2018, Chinese authorities in Shanxi province demolished a church, which created a wave of fear among the Christians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/chinese-authorities-demolish-well-known-evangelical-church/2018/01/11/d34a278c-f6a3-11e7-9af7-a50bc3300042_story.html |title=Chinese authorities demolish well-known evangelical church |last=Shih {{!}} AP |first=Gerry |date=2018-01-11 |work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-01-14|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/11/china-church-demolition-sparks-fears-of-campaign-against-christians |title=China church demolition sparks fears of campaign against Christians|last=Haas|first=Benjamin|date=2018-01-11|work=The Guardian|access-date=2018-01-14|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman Catholicism===
{{Main|Roman Catholicism in China}}

[[File:Catholic Church Cizhong Yunnan China.jpg|thumb|right|A Roman Catholic church by the Lancang (Mekong) River at Cizhong, Yunnan Province, China]]

China is home to an estimated 12 million Catholics, the majority of whom worship outside the official [[Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association]] (CPA). The State Administration for Religious Affairs states that there are 5.3 million Catholics belonging to the official Catholic Patriotic Association, which oversees 70 bishops, and approximately 6,000 churches nationwide.&lt;ref name=IRFR2010&gt;U.S Department of State, [https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2010/148863.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2010: China], 17 Nov 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there are roughly 40 bishops unordained by the CPA who operate unofficially, and recognize the authority of the Vatican.&lt;ref name=IRFR2010/&gt;

The state-sanctioned church appoints its own bishops, and as with all official religious, exercises control over the doctrine and leadership of the religion.&lt;ref name=CECC2011/&gt; As a matter of maintaining autonomy and rejecting foreign intervention, the official church has no official contact with the [[Roman Catholic Church|Vatican]], and does not recognize its authority.  However, the CPA has allowed for unofficial Vatican approval of ordinations. Although the CPA continues to carry out ordinations opposed by the Holy See, the majority of CPA bishops are now recognized by both authorities.&lt;ref name=Gardam/&gt; In addition to overseeing the practice of the Catholic faith, the CPA espouses politically oriented objectives as well. [[Liu Bainian]], chairman of the CPA and the Bishops Conference of the Catholic Church in China, stated in a 2011 interview that the church needed individuals who "love the country and love religion: politically, they should respect the Constitution, respect the law, and fervently love the socialist motherland.’’&lt;ref name=CECC2011/&gt;

Some Catholics who recognize the authority of the Holy See choose to worship clandestinely due to the risk of harassment from authorities. Several underground Catholic bishops have been reported disappeared or imprisoned, and harassment of unregistered bishops and priests is common.&lt;ref name=IRFR2010/&gt; There are reports of Catholic bishops and priests being forced by authorities to attend the ordination ceremonies for bishops who had not gained Vatican approval.&lt;ref name=CECC2011/&gt; Chinese authorities also have reportedly pressured Catholics to break communion with the Vatican by requiring them to renounce an essential belief in Roman Catholicism, the [[papal primacy|primacy]] of the Roman Pontiff. In other instances, however, authorities have permitted Vatican-loyal churches to carry out operations.&lt;ref name=IRFR2010/&gt;

===Protestantism===
{{Main|Protestantism in China}}
The [[Three-Self Patriotic Movement]], National Committee of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement of the Protestant Churches in China; the Three-Self Church or "TSPM" is the government-sanctioned ("patriotic") [[Christian]] organization in China.  Known in combination with the [[China Christian Council]] as the [[lianghui]], they form the only state-sanctioned ("registered") [[Protestant]] church in [[mainland China]]. All other Protestant denominations are illegal.

[[Chinese house church]]es are a religious movement of unregistered assemblies of [[Christian]]s in China, which operate independently of the government-run Three-Self Patriotic Movement (TSPM) and China Christian Council (CCC) for Protestant groups and the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association (CCPA) and the Chinese Catholic Bishops Council (CCBC) for Catholics. They are also known as the "Underground" Church or the "Unofficial" Church, although this is somewhat of a misnomer as they are collections of unrelated individual churches rather than a single unified church. They are called "house churches" because as they are not officially registered organizations, they cannot independently own property and hence they meet in private houses, often in secret for fear of arrest or imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q-7pfn04PxAC&amp;pg=PA95&amp;dq=falun+homosexuality&amp;cd=7#v=onepage&amp;q=house%20churches&amp;f=false |title=Understanding modern East Asian politics

==Buddhism==
===Tibetan Buddhism===
{{Main|Tibetan Buddhism}}
[[File:IMG 1972 Sakya.jpg|thumb|right|Two young Tibetan Buddhists at the Sakya Monastery in southern Tibet]]
China took full control of [[Tibet]] in 1959. In the wake of the takeover and especially during the [[cultural revolution]] many [[Buddhist monastery|monasteries]] were destroyed and many [[monk]]s and laypeople killed.  The [[14th Dalai Lama]] fled to India and has since ceded temporal power to an elected government-in-exile. The current [[Dalai Lama]] has attempted to negotiate with the Chinese authorities for greater autonomy and religious freedom for Tibet. As various high-ranking [[Lama]]s in the country have died, the authorities have proposed their own candidates on the religious authorities, which has led at times to rival claimants to the same position. In an effort to control this, the Chinese government passed a law in 2007 requiring a [[Reincarnation Application]] be completed and approved for all lamas wishing to reincarnate.&lt;ref name="Daily"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2007-08/04/content_5448242.htm|date=4 August 2007|title=Reincarnation of living Buddha needs gov't approval|publisher=China Daily|accessdate=2007-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The present incarnation of the [[Panchen Lama]] is disputed. The Dalai Lama recognises [[Gedhun Choekyi Nyima]]; however, the Chinese government recognises [[Gyaincain Norbu]] as the incarnation of the 11th Panchen Lama.&lt;ref&gt;China Tibet Information Center [http://zt.tibet.cn/tibetzt/panchen/banchan.html The 11th Panchen] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927221954/http://zt.tibet.cn/tibetzt/panchen/banchan.html |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Exile Tibetan sources allege that Gedhun Choekyi Nyima was kidnapped by the Chinese government.&lt;ref&gt;BBC news, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4551425.stm Tibet's Missing Spiritual Guide], May 6, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The identity of the Panchen Lama is of critical importance{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} to Tibetan Buddhism because he is one of the authorities that must approve the next Dalai Lama.

==Taoism==
[[Taoism|Taoist]] practitioners are required to register with the state-controlled Chinese Taoist Association (CTA), which exercises control over religious doctrine and personnel.&lt;ref name=CECC2011/&gt; Local governments restrict the construction of Taoist temples and statues, and call for abandonment of practices they deem to be "superstitious" or "feudal." The CTA dictates the proper interpretation of Taoist doctrine, and exhorts Taoist practitioners to support the Communist Party and the state. For example, a Taoist scripture reading class held by the CTA in November 2010 required participants to  ‘‘fervently love the socialist motherland [and] uphold the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party.’’&lt;ref name=CECC2011/&gt;

==Islam==
[[File:Hui family eid.jpg|thumb|left|An ethnic Hui family celebrates Eid]]
The State Administration for Religious Affairs places the number of Muslims in China at approximately 21 million, while independent estimates suggest the number could be upwards of 50 million.&lt;ref name=IRFR2010/&gt; According to a 2000 census, 96 percent of 20.3 million reported Muslims belong to three ethnic groups: Hui, Uyghur, and Kazakh. Most Hui Muslims live in [[Ningxia]], [[Qinghai]], and [[Gansu]] provinces, while Uyghur Muslims are found predominantly in the [[Xinjiang]].&lt;ref name=IRFR2010/&gt;

The state-run [[Islamic Association of China]] (IAC) oversees the practice of Islam, though many Muslims worship outside the state system. The IAC regulates the content of sermons and interpretation of religious scripture, exercises control over the confirmation of religious leaders, and monitors overseas pilgrimages. In 2001, the IAC established a committee to ensure that scriptures were interpreted in a manner to serve the interests of the Chinese government and Communist Party.&lt;ref name=CECC2011/&gt;

Authorities in Xinjiang impose rigid controls over religious expression, particularly over Uyghurs. Human rights reports indicate that crackdowns on religion are frequently integrated into security campaigns.&lt;ref name=CECC2011/&gt; Authorities monitor mosques, restrict the observation of Ramadan by government officials and students, and enact campaigns to prevent Uyghur men from wearing beards.&lt;ref name=CECC2011/&gt; Uyghur Muslims worshiping independently have been detained and charged with conducting "illegal religious activities."&lt;ref name=IRFR2010/&gt;

However, the suppression of the Uyghurs has more to do with the fact that they are separatist, rather than Muslim. China banned a book titled "Xing Fengsu" ("Sexual Customs") which insulted Islam and placed its authors under arrest in 1989 after protests in Lanzhou and Beijing by Chinese [[Hui people|Hui]] Muslims, during which the Chinese police provided protection to the Hui Muslim protestors, and the Chinese government organized public burnings of the book.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qBINAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=sexual+customs+banned+book+Islam&amp;dq=sexual+customs+banned+book+Islam&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vm7OVJDXOoKigwT9ioOgCw&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwBg Beijing Review, Volume 32 1989], p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=bcsmAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=sexual+customs+banned+book+Islam&amp;dq=sexual+customs+banned+book+Islam&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vm7OVJDXOoKigwT9ioOgCw&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAw Gladney 1991], p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=GomyOthrHjUC&amp;pg=PA154&amp;dq=xing+fengsu+sexual&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bHDOVO75GMe7ggSL1oOwAg&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=xing%20fengsu%20sexual&amp;f=false Schein 2000], p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=mzxSNM3_vCEC&amp;pg=PA66&amp;dq=xing+fengsu+sexual&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bHDOVO75GMe7ggSL1oOwAg&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=xing%20fengsu%20sexual&amp;f=false Gladney 2004], p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=sQLiMYUk-nIC&amp;pg=PA104&amp;dq=xing+fengsu+sexual&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bHDOVO75GMe7ggSL1oOwAg&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=xing%20fengsu%20sexual&amp;f=false Bulag 2010], p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=icZJJN0wYPcC&amp;pg=PA257&amp;dq=xing+fengsu+sexual&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bHDOVO75GMe7ggSL1oOwAg&amp;ved=0CEsQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=xing%20fengsu%20sexual&amp;f=false Gladney 2005], p. 257.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8WGOAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA144&amp;dq=xing+fengsu+sexual&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=dHLOVPb1BOjCsASe0YDADg&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=xing%20fengsu%20sexual&amp;f=false Gladney 2013], p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=HH94dPJrkA4C&amp;pg=PA79&amp;dq=xing+fengsu+sexual&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=dHLOVPb1BOjCsASe0YDADg&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q=xing%20fengsu%20sexual&amp;f=false Sautman 2000], p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_hJ9aht6nZQC&amp;pg=PA341&amp;dq=xing+fengsu+sexual&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=dHLOVPb1BOjCsASe0YDADg&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwCDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=xing%20fengsu%20sexual&amp;f=false Gladney 1996], p. 341.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=AvDOudr5M6MC&amp;pg=PA299&amp;dq=xing+fengsu+sexual&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=dHLOVPb1BOjCsASe0YDADg&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=xing%20fengsu%20sexual&amp;f=false Lipman 1996], p. 299.&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese government assisted them and gave into their demands because Hui do not have a separatist movement, unlike the Uyghurs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VIWC9wCX2c8C&amp;pg=PA581#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=China: a history|author=Harold Miles Tanner|year=2009|publisher=Hackett Publishing|location=|page=581|isbn=0-87220-915-6|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hui Muslim protestors who violently rioted by vandalizing property during the protests against the book were let off by the Chinese government and went unpunished while Uyghur protestors were imprisoned.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=mzxSNM3_vCEC&amp;pg=PA232&amp;dq=sexual+customs+banned+book&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=o23OVLLEGoaxggTAj4TwBw&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=sexual%20customs%20banned%20book&amp;f=false Gladney 2004], p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, anticipating the coming "Year of the Pig" in the [[Chinese calendar]], depictions of pigs were banned from [[China Central Television|CCTV]] "to avoid conflicts with ethnic minorities".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=7213210|title= Ban Thwarts 'Year of the Pig' Ads in China|last= Lim|first= Louisa|date= 6 February 2007|publisher=National Public Radio}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is believed to refer to China's population of 20 million [[Muslim]]s (to whom pigs are considered "[[Unclean animals|unclean]]").

In response to the 2015 [[Charlie Hebdo shooting]] Chinese state-run media attacked Charlie Hebdo for publishing the cartoons insulting Muhammad, with the state-run ''[[Xinhua]]'' advocated limiting freedom of speech, while another state-run newspaper ''[[Global Times]]'' said the attack was "payback" for what it characterised as Western colonialism and accusing Charlie Hebdo of trying to incite a clash of civilizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2015/01/12/charlie-hebdo-attack-shows-need-for-press-limits-xinhua-says/|title=Charlie Hebdo Attack Shows Need for Press Limits, Xinhua Says|work=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/01/13/asia-pacific/beijing-jumps-onto-paris-attack-to-feed-state-propaganda-machine/|title=Beijing jumps onto Paris attack to feed state propaganda machine|work=Japan Times|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different Muslim ethnic groups in different regions are treated differently by the Chinese government in regards to religious freedom. Religious freedom is present for Hui Muslims, who can practice their religion, build Mosques, and have their children attend Mosques, while more controls are placed specifically on Uyghurs in Xinjiang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=04dlwzB2SvcC&amp;pg=PA159#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Annual Report on International Religious Freedom, 2004|author=Senate (U S ) Committee on Foreign Relations|first=|date=|publisher=Government Printing Office|others=Compiled by State Dept (U S )|year=2005|isbn=0160725526|editor-last=|editor=State Dept (U S )|editor-first=|edition=illustrated|location=|pages=159–60|ref=harv|accessdate=24 April 2014|issue=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1980s Islamic private schools have been supported and permitted by the Chinese government among Muslim areas, only specifically excluding Xinjiang from allowing these schools because of separatist sentiment there.&lt;ref name="VersteeghEid2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kees Versteegh|author2=Mushira Eid|title=Encyclopedia of Arabic Language and Linguistics: A-Ed|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SuNiAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA383|year=2005|publisher=Brill|isbn=978-90-04-14473-6|pages=383–|quote=The People's Republic, founded in 1949, banned private confessional teaching from the early 1950s to the 1980s, until a more liberal stance allowed religious mosque education to resume and private Muslim schools to open.

Although religious education for children is officially forbidden by law in China, the Communist party allows Hui Muslims to violate this law and have their children educated in religion and attend Mosques while the law is enforced on Uyghurs. After secondary education is completed, China then allows Hui students who are willing to embark on religious studies under an Imam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/rss/31-1_007.pdf ALLÈS &amp; CHÉRIF-CHEBBI &amp; HALFON 2003], p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; China does not enforce the law against children attending Mosques on non-Uyghurs in areas outside of Xinjiang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=04dlwzB2SvcC&amp;pg=PA159#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Annual Report on International Religious Freedom, 2004|author=Senate (U S ) Committee on Foreign Relations|first=|date=|publisher=Government Printing Office|others=Compiled by State Dept (U S )|year=2005|isbn=0160725526|editor-last=|editor=State Dept (U S )|editor-first=|edition=illustrated|location=|page=160|pages=|ref=harv|accessdate=24 April 2014|issue=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Szadziewski|first1=Henryk|title=Religious Repression of Uyghurs in East Turkestan|url=http://www.venninstitute.org/uncategorized/religious-repression-of-uyghurs-in-east-turkestan|website=Venn Institute|accessdate=26 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140327231707/http://www.venninstitute.org/uncategorized/religious-repression-of-uyghurs-in-east-turkestan|archive-date=2014-03-27|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Uyghur views vary by the oasis they live in. China has historically favored Turpan and Hami. Uyghurs in Turfan and Hami and their leaders like Emin Khoja allied with the Qing against Uyghurs in [[Altishahr]]. During the Qing dynasty, China enfeoffed the rulers of Turpan and Hami (Kumul) as autonomous princes, while the rest of the Uyghurs in Altishahr (the Tarim Basin) were ruled by Begs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=MT2D_0_eBPQC&amp;pg=PA31#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Rudelson &amp; Rudelson 1997], p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Uyghurs from Turpan and Hami were appointed by China as officials to rule over Uyghurs in the Tarim Basin. Turpan is more economically prosperous and views China more positively than the rebellious Kashgar, which is the most anti-China oasis.

The Uyghur terrorist organization [[East Turkestan Islamic Movement]]'s magazine ''Islamic Turkistan'' has accused the Chinese "Muslim Brotherhood" (the [[Yihewani]]) of being responsible for the moderation of Hui Muslims and the lack of Hui joining terrorist jihadist groups in addition to blaming other things for the lack of Hui Jihadists, such as the fact that for more than 300 years Hui and Uyghurs have been enemies of each other, no separatist Islamist organizations among the Hui, the fact that the Hui view China as their home, and the fact that the "infidel Chinese" language is the language of the Hui.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zenn  |first=Jacob |last2= |first2= |date=March 17, 2011 &lt;!-- 05:10 PM --&gt;   |title=Jihad in China?

===Tibetan-Muslim sectarian violence===
In Tibet, the majority of Muslims are Hui people. Hatred between Tibeans and Muslims stems from events during the Muslim warlord [[Ma Bufang]]'s rule in Qinghai such as [[Ngolok rebellions (1917–49)]] and the [[Sino-Tibetan War]], but in 1949 the Communists put an end to the violence between Tibetans and Muslims, however, new Tibetan-Muslim violence broke out after China engaged in liberalization. Riots broke out between Muslims and Tibetans over incidents such as bones in soups and prices of balloons, and Tibetans accused Muslims of being cannibals who cooked humans in their soup and of contaminating food with urine. Tibetans attacked Muslim restaurants. Fires set by Tibetans which burned the apartments and shops of Muslims resulted in Muslim families being killed and wounded in the 2008 mid-March riots. Due to Tibetan violence against Muslims, the traditional Islamic white caps have not been worn by many Muslims. Scarfs were removed and replaced with hairnets by Muslim women in order to hide. Muslims prayed in secret at home when in August 2008 the Tibetans burned the Mosque. Incidents such as these which make Tibetans look bad on the international stage are covered up by the [[Tibetan exile]] community. The repression of Tibetan separatism by the Chinese government is supported by Hui Muslims.&lt;ref name="Demick"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jun/23/world/fg-muslims23 |title=Tibetan-Muslim tensions roil China |last=Demick |first=Barbara |publisher=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=2010-06-28 |deadurl=yes |date=23 June 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100622013126/http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jun/23/world/fg-muslims23 |archivedate=June 22, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Chinese-speaking Hui have problems with Tibetan Hui (the Tibetan speaking [[Kache]] minority of Muslims).&lt;ref name="Mayaram 2009 75"&gt;{{cite book| first = Shail |last=Mayaram| title = The other global city| url = {{google books |plainurl=y |id=tOZ1pBTJvp4C}}| accessdate = 2010-07-30| year = 2009| publisher = Taylor Francis US| isbn = 0-415-99194-3| page = 75 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main Mosque in Lhasa was burned down by Tibetans and Chinese Hui Muslims were violently assaulted by Tibetan rioters in the [[2008 Tibetan unrest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= |first= |date=28 March 2008 |title=Police shut Muslim quarter in Lhasa |url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/03/28/tibet.china.ap/ |newspaper=CNN |location=LHASA, Tibet |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080404073742/http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/03/28/tibet.china.ap/ |archivedate=April 4, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tibetan exiles and foreign scholars like ignore and do not talk about sectarian violence between Tibetan Buddhists and Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Fischer|2005|pp=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of Tibetans viewed the wars against Iraq and Afghanistan after 9/11 positively and it had the effect of galvanizing anti-Muslim attitudes among Tibetans and resulted in an anti-Muslim boycott against Muslim owned businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Fischer|2005|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tibetan Buddhists propagate a false libel that Muslims cremate their Imams and use the ashes to convert Tibetans to Islam by making Tibetans inhale the ashes, even though the Tibetans seem to be aware that Muslims practice burial and not cremation since they frequently clash against proposed Muslim cemeteries in their area.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Fischer|2005|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the Chinese government supports and backs up the Hui Muslims, the Tibetans deliberately attack the Hui Muslims as a way to demonstrate anti-government sentiment and because they have a background of sectarian violence against each other since Ma Bufang's rule due to their separate religions and ethnicity and Tibetans resent Hui economic domination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/analects/2012/11/tibetan-protest|title=The living picture of frustration |author=A.A. |date=November 11, 2012 &lt;!-- 8:26 --&gt; |newspaper=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936, after [[Sheng Shicai]] expelled 30,000 [[Kazakhs in China|Kazakhs]] from Xinjiang to Qinghai, [[Hui people|Hui]] led by General [[Ma Bufang]] massacred their fellow Muslim Kazakhs, until there were 135 of them left.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=2t5VAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=A+group+of+Kazakhs%2C+originally+numbering+over+20000+people+when+expelled+from+Sinkiang+by+Sheng+Shih-ts%27ai+in+1936%2C+was+reduced%2C+after+repeated+massacres+by+their+Chinese+coreligionists+under+Ma+Pu-fang%2C+to+a+scattered+135+people&amp;q=20000+expelled+repeated+massacres+ma+pu-fang+135#search_anchor|title=The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, Volume 277|author=American Academy of Political and Social Science|year=1951|publisher=American Academy of Political and Social Science|location=|page=152|isbn=|pages=|accessdate=2012-09-29|quote=A group of Kazakhs, originally numbering over 20000 people when expelled from Sinkiang by Sheng Shih-ts'ai in 1936, was reduced, after repeated massacres by their Chinese coreligionists under Ma Pu-fang, to a scattered 135 people.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From Northern Xinjiang over 7,000 Kazakhs fled to the Tibetan-Qinghai plateau region via Gansu and were wreaking massive havoc so Ma Bufang solved the problem by relegating the Kazakhs into designated pastureland in Qinghai, but Hui, Tibetans, and Kazakhs in the region continued to clash against each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lin|2011|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=osn1WrRCelcC&amp;pg=PA112 112–]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tibetans attacked and fought against the Kazakhs as they entered Tibet via Gansu and Qinghai.

In northern Tibet Kazakhs clashed with Tibetan soldiers and then the Kazakhs were sent to Ladakh.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lin|2011|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=osn1WrRCelcC&amp;pg=PA1231 231–]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a period of meteoric growth of [[Falun Gong]] in the 1990s, the Communist Party launched a campaign to "eradicate" Falun Gong on 20 July 1999. The suppression is characterised by multifaceted propaganda campaign, a program of enforced ideological conversion and re-education, and a variety of extralegal coercive measures such as arbitrary arrests, [[forced labor]], and physical [[torture]], sometimes resulting in death.&lt;ref name="Amnesty1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/ASA17/011/2000/en |title=China: The crackdown on Falun Gong and other so-called "heretical organizations"|date=23 March 2000|publisher=Amnesty International|accessdate=17 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Jainism}}
{{God|by religion}}
In [[Jainism]], godliness is said to be the inherent quality of every [[jiva|soul]]. This quality, however, is subdued by the soul's association with karmic matter. All souls who have achieved the natural state of infinite bliss, infinite knowledge (''[[kevala jnana]]''), infinite power and infinite perception are regarded as '''God in Jainism'''. Jainism rejects the idea of a [[creator deity]] responsible for the manifestation, creation, or maintenance of this universe. According to Jain doctrine, the universe and its constituents (soul, matter, space, time, and principles of motion) have [[Jainism and non-creationism|always existed]]. All the constituents and actions are governed by universal natural laws and perfect soul, an [[wikt:immaterial|immaterial entity]] cannot create or affect a material entity like the universe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jainworld.com/scriptures/niyamsara.asp ''The Perfect Law''] Jainworld.org&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
From the essential perspective, the soul of every living organism is perfect in every way, is independent of any actions of the organism, and is considered God or to have godliness. But the epithet of God is given to the soul in whom its properties manifest in accordance with its inherent nature. There are [[Jain philosophy#Infinity|countably infinite]] souls in the universe.

According to ''[[Ratnakaranda śrāvakācāra]]'' (a major Jain text):&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| title=The Ratna Karanda Sravakachara | publisher=The Central Jaina Publishing House|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Ratna_karanda_sravakachara.html?id=kLAlAQAAIAAJ | archive-url=https://archive.org/details/TheRatnaKarandaSravakachara | archive-date=2015 | date=1917 | author=Jain, Champat Rai|authorlink=Champat Rai Jain|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:आप्तेनो च्छिनदोषेण सर्वज्ञेनागमेशिना।
:भवितव्यं नियोगेन नान्यथा ह्याप्तता भवेत्।।५।

:In the nature of things the true God should be free from the faults and weaknesses of the lower nature; [he should be] the knower of all things and the revealer of dharma; in no other way can divinity be constituted.

:क्षुत्पिपासाजराजरातक्ड जन्मान्तकभयस्मयाः।
:न रागद्वेषमोहाश्च यस्याप्तः स प्रकीर्त्यते ।।६।।
:He alone who is free from hunger, thirst, senility, disease, birth, death, fear, pride, attachment, aversion, infatuation, worry, conceit, hatred, uneasiness, sweat, sleep and surprise is called a God.

== Godliness ==
In Jainism, godliness is said to be the inherent quality of every soul (or every living organism) characterizing infinite bliss, infinite power, ''[[Kevala Jnana]]'' (pure infinite knowledge),{{sfn|Sangave|2001|p=164}} infinite perception, and perfect manifestations of (countably) infinite other attributes. There are two possible views after this point. One is to look at the soul from the perspective of the soul itself. This entails explanations of the properties of the soul, its exact structure, composition and nature, the nature of various states that arise from it and their source attributes as is done in the deep and arcane texts of [[Samayasāra]], [[Niyamasara]] and [[Pravachanasara]]. Another view is to consider things apart from the soul and its relationships with the soul. According to this view, the qualities of a soul are subdued due to [[Karma in Jainism|karmas]] of the soul. ''Karmas'' are the fundamental particles of nature in Jainism. One who achieves this state of soul through [[Ratnatraya|right belief, right knowledge and right conduct]] can be termed a god. This perfection of soul is called ''Kevalin''. A god thus becomes a liberated soul – liberated of miseries, cycles of rebirth, world, ''karmas'' and finally liberated of body as well. This is called ''nirvana'' or ''[[Moksa (Jainism)|moksha]]''.

Jainism does not teach the dependency on any [[God|supreme being]] for enlightenment. The Tirthankara is a guide and teacher who points the way to enlightenment, but the struggle for enlightenment is one's own. Moral rewards and sufferings are not the work of a divine being, but a result of an innate moral order in the [[cosmos]]; a self-regulating mechanism whereby the individual reaps the fruits of his own actions through the workings of the karmas.

Jains believe that to attain enlightenment and ultimately liberation from all karmic bonding, one must practice the ethical principles not only in thought, but also in words (speech) and action. Such a practice through lifelong work towards oneself is regarded as observing the ''[[Mahavrata]]'' ("Great Vows").

Gods can be thus categorized into embodied gods also known as ''arihantas'' and non-embodied formless gods who are called ''Siddhas''. Jainism considers the ''devīs'' and ''devas'' to be souls who dwell in heavens owing to meritorious deeds in their past lives. These souls are in heavens for a fixed lifespan and even they have to undergo reincarnation as humans to achieve ''moksha''.

Thus, there are infinite gods in Jainism, all equivalent, liberated, and infinite in the manifestation of all attributes. The Self and karmas are separate substances in Jainism, the former living and the latter non-living. The attainment of [[enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]] and the one who exists in such a state, then those who have achieved such a state can be termed gods. Therefore, beings ([[Arihant (Jainism)|Arihant]]) who've attained omniscience (''kevala jnana'') are worshipped as gods. The quality of godliness is one and the same in all of them. Jainism is sometimes regarded as a [[Transtheism|transtheistic]] religion,{{sfn|Zimmer|1953|p=182}} though it can be [[atheistic]] or [[polytheistic]] based on the way one defines "God".

== Five supreme beings ==
{{Main|Pañca-Parameṣṭhi}}
[[File:पंच परमेष्ठी.jpg|thumb|Stella depicting ''Pañca-Parameṣṭhi'' (five supreme beings) worthy of veneration as per Jainism]]
In Jainism, the ''Pañca-Parameṣṭhi'' (Sanskrit for "five supreme beings") are a fivefold hierarchy of religious authorities worthy of veneration. The five supreme beings are:
# ''[[Arihant (Jainism)|Arihant]]''
# ''[[Siddha#Jainism|Siddha]]''
# ''[[Acharya (Jainism)|Acharya]]'' (Head of the monastic order)
# ''[[Upajjhaya|Upadhyaya]]'' ("Preceptor of less advanced ascetics")
# ''Muni'' or ''[[Jain monasticism|Jain monks]]''

== Arihant ==
{{Main|Arihant (Jainism)}}
A human being who conquers all inner passions and possesses infinite right knowledge (''[[Kevala Jnana]]'') is revered as an ''[[Arihant (Jainism)|arihant]]'' in [[Jainism]].{{sfn|Sangave|2001|p=15}} They are also called ''Jinas'' (conquerors) or ''Kevalin'' (omniscient beings). An arihant is a soul who has destroyed all passions, is totally unattached and without any desire and hence is able to destroy the four ''[[Karma in Jainism#Ghatiya karmas|ghātiyā karmas]]'' and attain ''kevala jñāna'', or omniscience. Such a soul still has a body and four ''[[Karma in Jainism#Aghatiya karmas|aghātiyā karmas]]''. ''Arihantas'', at the end of their human life-span, destroy all remaining ''aghātiyā karmas'' and attain Siddhahood. There are two kinds of ''kevalin'' or  ''arihant'':{{sfn|Sangave|2001|p=16}}
* ''Sāmānya Kevalin''–Ordinary victors, who are concerned with their own salvation.
* ''Tirthankara Kevalin''–Twenty-four human spiritual guides (teaching gods), who show the true path to salvation.{{sfn|Rankin|2013|p=40}}

== Tīrthaṅkara ==
{{Main|Tirthankara}}
[[File:Vardhaman Keezhakuyilkudi.jpg|thumb|Image of Vardhamana Mahavira, the 24th and last Tirthankara (Photo:[[Samanar Hills]])]]
The word ''Tīrthaṅkara'' signifies the founder of a ''tirtha'' which means a fordable passage across a sea. The ''Tirthankara'' show the 'fordable path' across the sea of interminable births and deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Jain|first=Champat Rai|title=Jainism, Christianity and Science|publisher=The Indian Press, Allahabad|date=1930|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=emsrAAAAIAAJ|archive-url=https://archive.org/details/JainismChristianityAndScience|archive-date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jain philosophy]] divides the wheel of time in two halves, ''Utsarpiṇī'' or ascending time cycle and ''[[avasarpiṇī]]'', the descending time cycle. Exactly 24 ''Tirthankara'' are said to grace each half of the cosmic time cycle.{{sfn|Sangave|2001|p=16-17}} '' ''[[Rishabhanatha]]'' was the first ''Tirthankara'' and [[Mahavira]] was the last ''Tirthankara'' of ''avasarpiṇī''.{{sfn|Sangave|2001|p=16-17}}

''Tirthankara'' revive the fourfold order of ''Shraman, Shramani, [[Śrāvaka (Jainism)|Śrāvaka]], and Śrāvika'' called ''sangha''. [[Tirthankara]]'' can be called teaching gods who teach the [[Jain philosophy]]. However it would be a mistake to regard the ''tirthankara'' as gods analogous to the gods of the [[Hindu]] pantheon despite the superficial resemblances between Jain and Hindu ways of worship.&lt;ref&gt;Thrower (1980), p.93&lt;/ref&gt; ''Tirthankara'', being liberated, are beyond any kind of transactions with the rest of the universe. They are ''not'' the beings who exercise any sort of creative activity or who have the capacity or ability to intervene in answers to prayers.

''Tirthamkara-nama-karma'' is a special type of ''karma'', bondage of which raises a soul to the supreme status of a ''tirthankara''.{{sfn|Jain|1917|p=48}}

== Siddhas ==
{{Main|Siddha}}
[[File:Siddha idol.jpg|thumb|left|Although the ''siddhas'' (the liberated beings) are formless and without a body, this is how the [[Jain temple]]s often depict them.]]
Ultimately all ''arihantas'' become ''siddhas'', or liberated souls, at the time of their [[Nirvana (Jainism)|nirvana]]. A ''siddha'' is a soul who is permanently liberated from the [[Saṃsāra (Jainism)|transmigratory cycle of birth and death]]. Such a soul, having realized its true self, is free from all the ''Karmas'' and embodiment. They are formless and dwell in ''[[Siddhashila]]'' (the realm of the liberated beings) at the apex of the universe in infinite bliss, infinite perception, infinite knowledge and infinite energy.

The [[Acharanga Sutra]] 1.197 describes ''siddhas'' in this way:
{{quote|The liberated soul is not long nor small nor round nor triangular nor quadrangular nor circular; it is not black nor blue nor red nor green nor white; neither of good nor bad smell; not bitter nor pungent nor astringent nor sweet; neither rough nor soft; neither heavy nor light; neither cold nor hot; neither harsh nor smooth; it is without body, without resurrection, without contact (of matter), it is not feminine nor masculine nor neuter. The siddha perceives and knows all, yet is beyond comparison. Its essence is without form; there is no condition of the unconditioned. It is not sound, not colour, not smell, not taste, not touch or anything of that kind. Thus I say.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobi (1884) Retrieved on : 25 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/cite&gt;}}

[[File:Siddha Shila.svg|400px|thumb|Siddhashila as per the [[Jain cosmology]]]]
Siddhahood is the ultimate goal of all souls. There are infinite souls who have become ''siddhas'' and infinite more who will attain this state of liberation.{{Ref_label|D|d|none}} According to Jainism, Godhood is not a monopoly of some omnipotent and powerful being(s). All souls, with right perception, knowledge and conduct can achieve self-realisation and attain this state. Once achieving this state of infinite bliss and having destroyed all desires, the soul is not concerned with worldly matters and does not interfere in the working of the universe, as any activity or desire to interfere will once again result in influx of karmas and thus loss of liberation.

Jains pray to these passionless Gods not for any favors or rewards but rather pray to the qualities of the God with the objective of destroying the ''karmas'' and achieving the Godhood. This is best understood by the term ''vandetadgunalabhdhaye'' – i.e. "we pray to the attributes of such Gods to acquire such attributes" {{Ref_label|F|f|none}}&lt;ref&gt;Nayanar (2005b), p.35 Gāthā 1.29&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Anne Vallely:
{{quote|Jainism is not a religion of coming down. In Jainism it is we who must go up. We only have to help ourselves. In Jainism we have to become God. That is the only thing.&lt;ref name="Anne"&gt;Vallely, Anne (1980).  In: ''Guardians of the Transcendent: An Ethnology of a Jain Ascetic Community''. University of Toronto Press: Toronto .p.182&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Heavenly beings ==
{{main|Deva (Jainism)}}
[[File:Padmavati.JPG|thumb|Idol of [[Padmavati (Jainism)|Padmāvatī]] devī, śāsanadevī of Lord [[Parshvanatha]] at Walkeshwar Temple. She is one of the most popular demi-goddess amongst the Jains. According to Digambar Terapanth, worship of such deities is considered as ''mithyātva'' or wrong belief. However, in the Bispanthi Digambar tradition and the Shwetambar tradition, Padmavati is a popular Jain goddess.]]
[[Jain cosmology]] offers an elaborate description of heavenly beings (''devas''), but these beings are neither viewed as creators nor as Gods; they are subject to suffering and change like all other living beings, and must eventually die.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Jainism describes existence of ''śāsanadevatās'' and ''śāsanadevīs'', the attendants of a ''Tirthankara'', who create the ''[[samavasarana]]'' or the divine preaching assembly of a ''Tirthankara''. Such heavenly beings are classified as:-
* ''Bhavanapatis'' – Deva dwelling in abodes
* ''Vyantaras'' – Intermediary devas
* ''Jyotiṣkas'' – Luminaries
* ''Vaimānikas'' – Astral devas

The souls on account of accumulation of meritorious ''karmas'' reincarnate in heavens as devas. Although their life span is quite long, after their merit ''[[Karma in Jainism|karmas]]'' are exhausted, they once again have to reincarnate back into the realms of humans, animals or [[Naraka (Jainism)|hells]] depending on their karmas. As these devas themselves are not liberated, they have attachments and passions and hence not worthy of worship.

Ācārya [[Hemachandra]] decries the worship of such devas:
{{quote|These heavenly beings (devas above) tainted with attachment and passion; having women and weapons by their side, favour some and disfavour some; Such heavenly beings (devas) should not be worshipped by those who desire emancipation&lt;ref&gt;Gopani (1989), emended&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;}}
Worship of such devas is considered as ''[[mithyatva]]'' or wrong belief leading to bondage of karmas.

==Jain opposition to creationism==
{{main|Jainism and non-creationism}}
Jain scriptures reject God as the creator of the universe. Further, it asserts that no God is responsible or causal for actions in the life of any living organism. Ācārya Hemacandra in the 12th century put forth the Jain view of the universe in the ''[[Yogaśāstra]]'':&lt;ref&gt;http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/002500819&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|This universe is not created nor sustained by anyone;
It is self-sustaining, without any base or support}}

Besides scriptural authority, Jains also resorted to [[syllogism]] and [[deductive reasoning]] to refute the creationist theories. Various views on divinity and the universe held by the [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedics]], [[samkhya]]s, [[mīmāṃsā]]s, [[Buddhists]] and other schools of thought were analyzed, debated and repudiated by various Jain Ācāryas. However, the most eloquent refutation of this view is provided by Ācārya [[Jinasena]] in [[Adipurana|Mahāpurāna]],&lt;ref&gt;''Afterword on Jinasena'', D. Lakey, ''[[The Philosophical Forum]]'', Volume 33 Issue 3 Page 343-344 - Fall 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Primal Myths: Creating the World'', Barbara Sproul, http://www.abebooks.com/book-search/isbn/0060675004/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;PDF of the text - http://www.jaina.org/?page=jainbooks&lt;/ref&gt; which was quoted by [[Carl Sagan]] in his book ''[[Cosmos (book)|Cosmos]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.angelfire.com/blog2/endovelico/CarlSagan-Cosmos.pdf on page 140&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|Some foolish men declare that creator made the world. The doctrine that the world was created is ill advised and should be rejected.
If God created the world, where was he before the creation? If you say he was transcendent then and needed no support, where is he now?
How could God have made this world without any raw material? If you say that he made this first, and then the world, you are faced with an endless regression.

If you declare that this raw material arose naturally you fall into another fallacy, for the whole universe might thus have been its own creator, and have arisen quite naturally.

If God created the world by an act of his own will, without any raw material, then it is just his will and nothing else — and who will believe this silly nonsense?

If he is ever perfect and complete, how could the will to create have arisen in him? If, on the other hand, he is not perfect, he could no more create the universe than a potter could.

If he is form-less, action-less and all-embracing, how could he have created the world? Such a soul, devoid of all modality, would have no desire to create anything.

If he is perfect, he does not strive for the three aims of man, so what advantage would he gain by creating the universe?

If you say that he created to no purpose because it was his nature to do so, then God is pointless. If he created in some kind of sport, it was the sport of a foolish child, leading to trouble.

If he created because of the karma of embodied beings (acquired in a previous creation), then he is not the Almighty Lord, but subordinate to something else.

If out of love for living beings and need of them he made the world, why did he not make creation wholly blissful free from misfortune?

If he were transcendent he would not create, for he would be free: Nor if involved in transmigration, for then he would not be almighty. Thus the doctrine that the world was created by God makes no sense at all.

And God commits great sin in slaying the children whom he himself created. If you say that he slays only to destroy evil beings, why did he create such beings in the first place?

Good men should combat the believer in divine creation, maddened by an evil doctrine. Know that the world is uncreated, as time itself is, without beginning or end, and is based on the principles, life and rest. Uncreated and indestructible, it endures under the compulsion of its own nature.}}

{{Judaism}}

Among the [[honorifics in Judaism]], there are several traditional '''honorifics for the dead''' which are used when naming and speaking of the deceased. Different honorifics might be applied depending on the particular status of the deceased. These honorifics are frequently found on [[Headstone|gravestones]], on [[memorial wall (disambiguation)|memorial wall]]s inside the sanctuary of [[synagogue]]s, in speeches, and in writing such as in [[Obituary|obituaries]].

In writing, it is most common to use the name followed by an abbreviation of an honorific either in Hebrew or English. For examples, see chart.

==Comparison chart==
The following chart shows different [[honorific]]s used, along with their abbreviation in [[Hebrew]] and [[English language|English]], their translation, the masculine and feminine forms, the type of person which the honorific is applied to, and examples.

==General honorifics==
Some honorifics may be used for any individual. These honorifics are generally not used for rabbis or other special persons, since the specific honorifics for those people are used instead, as a sign of honor and respect. See below.

===Of blessed memory===
The most common honorific is "'''''of blessed memory''''',"&lt;ref name=Ben-Yehuda&gt;{{Cite book|editor1=Ben-Yehuda, Ehud |editor2=Weinstein, David |title=Ben-Yehuda's Pocket English-Hebrew Hebrew-English Dictionary|location=New York|publisher =Pocket Books|year = 1961|page=xx-xxvi|isbn=0-671-47211-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Hebrew transliteration is "'''''zikhrono livrakha'''''" (m.) / "'''''zikhronah livrakha'''''" (f.) (Hebrew: (f.) "'''{{Hebrew|זיכרונה לברכה}}'''" \ (m.) "'''{{Hebrew|זיכרונו לברכה}}'''"). It is often abbreviated in English both as'' '''OBM''' ''and as'' “'''Z"L'''''” The Hebrew abbreviation is "'''{{Hebrew|ז״ל}}'''."

===Peace be upon him/her===
An alternative honorific is "'''''Peace be upon him/her'''''." The Hebrew version is "'''''alav ha-shalom'''''" (m.) / "'''''aleha ha-shalom'''''" (f.) (Hebrew: (m.)  "'''''עליו השלום'''''" / (f.) "'''''עליה השלום'''''"). It is abbreviated in English as “'''A"H'''.” The Hebrew abbreviation is "'''ע״ה'''."

This phrase is the same as the [[Islam]]ic honorific "[[Peace be upon him (Islam)|peace be upon him]]" (which is used for all [[prophets of Islam]]). However, unlike in Islamic usage, the English abbreviation "PBUH" is not commonly used for the Jewish honorific.

The above two may be used interchangeably; however "'''''of blessed memory'''''" is the most common.

===May HaShem avenge his/her blood===
This honorific "'''''May HaShem avenge his/her blood'''''" is generally used for an individual who perished as a result of anti-semitism, for example [[pogrom]]s or the [[Holocaust]]. The term is also applied to any innocent Jew killed, whether for anti-Semitic reasons or others.  The Hebrew phrase is "'''''HaShem yikom damo'''''" (m.) / "'''''HaShem yikom dama'''''" (f.) / "'''''HaShem yikom damam'''''" (pl.) and in the Hebrew: "'''''השם יקום דמו'''''" (m.) / "'''''השם יקום דמה'''''" (f.) / "'''''השם יקום דמם'''''" (pl.). The English abbreviation is “'''HY"D'''” and in Hebrew "'''הי״ד'''."

==Holy and the righteous==
The abbreviation “'''זי״ע'''/zy"a” stands for "''zekhuto yagen `aleinu''/May his merit shield us," and often follows the mention of meritorious righteous ones.  A variant is “'''זיע״א'''/zya"a” which adds "Amen" at the end.

===Memory of the righteous===
The honorific "'''''May the memory of the righteous be a blessing'''''" is used after the names of holy [[rabbi]]s and other [[saint|ho]]ly people, from {{Bibleverse||Proverbs|10:7|1000}}. In Hebrew transliteration: "'''''zekher tzadik livrakha'''''" and in Hebrew: "'''''זכר צדיק לברכה'''''." The English abbreviation commonly used is “'''ZT"L'''” and in Hebrew, "'''זצ״ל'''" is used. It is pronounced in reading as "''zatzal''." It may be also written as “'''ZTz"L'''”.

It is used primarily in reference to rabbis who have been deceased in recent memory. Thus, one is likely to write “Rabbi [[Moshe Feinstein]] ZT"L” (d. 1986) but far less likely to write “[[Rashi]] ZT"L” (d. 1105).

===Memory of the holy martyrs===
"'''''May the memory of the holy be a blessing'''''" is used specifically for holy [[martyr]]s and those killed in times of persecution, for example, in [[the Holocaust]].  In Hebrew transliteration "'''''zekher kadosh l'vrakhah'''''" and in Hebrew "'''''זכר קדוש לברכה'''''." It may be abbreviated as “'''ZK"L'''” or in Hebrew "'''זק״ל'''."  It is not very common.

The influence of the Islamic world to the history of glass is reflected by its distribution around the world, from Europe to China, and from Russia to East Africa. '''Islamic glass''' developed a unique expression that was characterized by the introduction of new techniques and the innovation of old traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Pinder-Wilson 1991, 112&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roman and Sassanian influences==
Islamic glass did not begin to develop a recognizable expression until the late 8th or early 9th century AD, despite Islam spreading across the Middle East and North Africa during the mid-7th century AD.&lt;ref name="Israeli319"&gt;Israeli 2003, 319&lt;/ref&gt; Despite bringing enormous religious and socio-political changes to the region, this event appears to have not drastically affected the day-to-day workings of craft industries, nor did it cause "extensive destruction or long-lasting disruption".&lt;ref&gt;Schick 1998, 75&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Byzantine glass|Roman]] ([[Levant]] and [[Egypt]]) and [[Sassanian]] ([[Persia]] and [[Mesopotamia]]) glassmaking industries continued in much the same way they had for centuries. Following the unification of the entire region, the interaction of ideas and techniques was facilitated, allowing for the fusion of these two separate traditions with new ideas, ultimately leading to the Islamic glass industry.&lt;ref name="Israeli319" /&gt; Roman glassmaking traditions that are important in the Islamic period include the application of glass trails as a surface embellishment, while stylistic techniques adopted from the [[Sassanian Empire]] include various styles of glass cutting. This may have developed out of the long-standing [[hardstone carving]] traditions in [[Persia]] and [[Mesopotamia]].&lt;ref&gt;Carboni 2001, 15–17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pinder-Wilson 1991, 115–122&lt;/ref&gt; In regards to glass-making technology, tank furnaces used in the [[Levant]] to produce slabs of raw glass for export during the Classical Period were used during the Early Islamic Period in the same region until the 10th or 11th centuries AD.&lt;ref&gt;Aldsworth et al. 2002, 65&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Freestone 2006, 202"&gt;Freestone 2006, 202&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technological change==
During the first centuries of Islamic rule, glassmakers in the Eastern Mediterranean continued to use the Roman recipe consisting of calcium-rich sand (providing the silica and lime) and mineral [[natron]] (soda component) from the Wādi el-Natrūn in [[Egypt]], and examples of natron-based Islamic glass have been found in the [[Levant]] up to the late 9th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;Whitehouse 2002, 193–195&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeological evidence has shown that the use of [[natron]] ceased, and plant ash became the source of soda for all Islamic glass in the following centuries.&lt;ref name="Dussart et al. 2004"&gt;Dussart et al. 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freestone 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freestone 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whitehouse 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons for this technological transition remain unclear, although it has been postulated that civil unrest in [[Egypt]] during the early 9th century AD led to a cut-off in the natron supply, thus forcing Islamic glassmakers to look for alternate soda sources.&lt;ref&gt;Whitehouse 2002, 194&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence of experimentation with the basic glass recipe at [[Beth She'arim]] (modern [[Israel]]) during the early 9th century AD further supports this argument. A glass slab made from a tank mold from the site contained an excess amount of lime, and may be the result of mixing sand with plant ash.&lt;ref&gt;Freestone and Gorin-Rosin 1999, 116&lt;/ref&gt; Although the raw glass would have been unusable due to its composition, it does suggest that at this time, Islamic glassmakers in the [[Levant]] were combining aspects of [[Sassanian]] and Roman traditions in an effort to solve the problem created by the lack of access to mineral natron. The use of plant ash, specifically from [[halophytic]] (salt-loving) plants, which were plentiful in the [[Middle East]] due to the climate,&lt;ref&gt;Barkoudah and Henderson 2006, 297–298&lt;/ref&gt; was well known in [[Persia]] and [[Mesopotamia]]. It undoubtedly would not take long for the glassmakers in the [[Near East]] to correct their manufacturing errors and begin using the plant ash-based recipe used further east.

==Early Islamic glass: mid-7th to late 12th century AD==
[[File:Glass beaker MET 40-170-180.jpg|thumb|left|9th century beaker, [[Nishapur]].]]
The glass industry in the Early Islamic Period can initially be characterized as a continuation of older traditions, coinciding with the [[Umayyad]] Caliphate, the first Islamic dynasty (Israeli 2003, 319). Following the rise of the [[Abbasid]] Caliphate in 750 AD, the capital of the Islamic world was moved from [[Damascus]] in the [[Levant]] to [[Baghdad]] in [[Mesopotamia]]. This led to a cultural shift away from the influences of Classical traditions, and allowed for the development of an 'Islamic' expression.&lt;ref name="Israeli 2003, 320"&gt;Israeli 2003, 320&lt;/ref&gt;

The production of glass during this period is concentrated in three main regions of the Islamic world. Firstly, the Eastern Mediterranean remained a centre of glass production, as it had been for centuries. Excavations at Qal'at Sem'an in northern [[Syria]],&lt;ref name="Dussart et al. 2004"/&gt; [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] in [[Lebanon]],&lt;ref&gt;Aldsworth et al. 2002&lt;/ref&gt; [[Beth She'arim]] and Bet Eli'ezer in [[Israel]],&lt;ref name="Freestone 2006, 202"/&gt; and at [[Fustat]] (Old [[Cairo]]) in [[Egypt]]&lt;ref&gt;Scanlon and Pinder-Wilson 2001&lt;/ref&gt; have all shown evidence for glass production, including numerous vessels, raw glass, and their associated furnaces. Also adding to our understanding of the glass industry in this region is the aforementioned shipwreck at Serçe Liman. In [[Persia]], a formerly [[Sassanian]] region, archaeological activity has located a number of sites with large deposits of Early Islamic Glass, including [[Nishapur]], [[Siraf]], and [[Susa]].&lt;ref&gt;Kröger 1995, 1–6&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous kilns suggest [[Nishapur]] was an important production centre, and the identification of a local type of glass at [[Siraf]] suggests the same for that site.&lt;ref&gt;Kröger 1995, 5-20&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Mesopotamia]], excavations at Samarra, a temporary capital of the [[Abbasid]] Caliphate during the mid-9th century AD, produced a wide range of glass vessels, while work at al-Madā'in (former [[Ctesiphon]]) and [[Raqqa]] (on the [[Euphrates River]] in modern [[Syria]]) provide evidence for glass production in the region.&lt;ref&gt;Freestone 2006, 203&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kröger 1995, 6–7&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is difficult to clearly identify the place in which a glass piece was manufactured without the presence of wastes (pieces broken and discarded in the process of making), which indicate that the location was a site of glassmaking. Furthermore, during the Abbasid caliphate, both glassmakers and their products moved throughout the empire, leading to dispersion of glassware and "universality of style", which further prevents the identification of a piece's birthplace. As the Seljuk empire arose from Seljuk generals conquering lands under the Abbasid flag only nominally, it is likely that glass technology, style, and trade might have continued similarly under the Seljuks as it did under the Abbasids.&lt;ref&gt;Ragab 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the increasing ability and style of Islamic glassmakers during this time, few pieces were signed or dated, making identification of a piece's location of origin unfortunately difficult. Glass pieces are typically dated by stylistic comparisons to other pieces from the era.&lt;ref&gt;Lukens 2013, 199&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of the decorative traditions used in the Early Islamic Period concerned the manipulation of the glass itself, and included trail-application, carving, and mold-blowing.&lt;ref name="Israeli 2003, 320"/&gt; As mentioned previously, glass-carving and trail application are a continuation of older techniques, the former associated with [[Sassanian]] glassmaking and the latter with Roman traditions. In relief cutting, a specialized form of glass-carving most often used on colourless and transparent glass, "the area surrounding the decorative elements was carved back to the ground, thus leaving the former in relief".&lt;ref&gt;Pinder-Wilson 1991, 116&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Palmer cup DSCF9673 Waddesdon bequest, British Museum.JPG|thumb|A seated prince on the [[Palmer Cup]], an early Iranian painted glass, drawing on motifs used on pottery]]

Unlike relief cutting, trail application, or thread trailing, allowed decoration with hot glass.&lt;ref name="Jenkins 2013, 28"&gt;Jenkins 2013, 28&lt;/ref&gt; The glassblower would manipulate molten glass while still malleable and create patterns, handles, or flanges. While cutting reached the height of its popularity from the 9th–11th centuries CE,&lt;ref&gt;Lukens 2013, 200&lt;/ref&gt; thread-trailing became more widely used during the 11th–12th centuries, when Seljuq glassmakers were considered at the height of their skill.&lt;ref&gt;Lukens 2013, 207&lt;/ref&gt;

Mold-blowing, based on Roman traditions from the 1st century CE, is another specialized technique that spread widely throughout the Islamic Mediterranean world during this period. Two distinct types of molds are known archaeologically; a two-part mold made up of separate halves, and the 'dip' mold, whereby the viscous glass is placed entirely inside one mold.&lt;ref&gt;Carboni 2001, 198&lt;/ref&gt; The molds were often made of bronze,&lt;ref&gt;Carboni 2001, 197&lt;/ref&gt; although there are examples of some being ceramic.&lt;ref&gt;von Folsach and Whitehouse 1993, 149&lt;/ref&gt; Molds also typically mold that often included a carved pattern; the finished piece would take on the shape and style of the mold (Carboni and Adamjee 2002). With these advances in glassmaking technology, artisans began to stylize and simplify their designs, emphasizing designs with "no foreground or background" and "plain but beautiful vessels".&lt;ref name="Jenkins 2013, 28"/&gt;

A final decorative technology that is a distinct marker of the Early Islamic Period is the use of [[Lustre (mineralogy)|lustre]] painting. While some scholars see this as a purely Islamic invention originating in [[Fustat]],&lt;ref&gt;Pinder-Wilson 1991, 124&lt;/ref&gt; others place the origins of lustre decoration in Roman and [[Coptic Egypt]] during the centuries preceding the rise of [[Islam]]. Staining glass vessels with copper and silver pigments was known from around the 3rd century AD,&lt;ref name="Carboni 2001, 51"&gt;Carboni 2001, 51&lt;/ref&gt; although true lustre technology probably began sometime between the 4th and 8th centuries AD.&lt;ref&gt;Caiger-Smith 1985, 24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pradell et al. 2008, 1201&lt;/ref&gt; Lustre painting on glass involves the application of copper and silver pigments, followed by a specific firing that allows for the ionic exchange of Ag+ and Cu+ with the glass, resulting in a metallic sheen fully bound to the vessel.&lt;ref&gt;Pradell et al. 2008, 1204&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of its specific origins, lustre decoration was a key technology in glass production that continued to develop throughout the Early Islamic Period, and spread not only geographically, but also to other material industries in the form of glazed ceramics.&lt;ref name="Carboni 2001, 51"/&gt;

==Middle Islamic glass: late 12th to late 14th century AD==
{{see also|Hebron glass}}
This is the 'Golden Age' of Islamic glassmaking,&lt;ref name="Israeli 2003, 321"&gt;Israeli 2003, 321&lt;/ref&gt; despite the fractious nature of the Islamic world. [[Persia]] and [[Mesopotamia]] (along with parts of [[Syria]] for some time) came under control of the [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuq]] Turks, and later the Mongols, while in the Eastern Mediterranean, the [[Ayyubid]] and [[Mamluk]] Dynasties held sway. Furthermore, this period saw European interruptions into the Middle East due to the [[Crusades]].&lt;ref name="Israeli 2003, 321"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pinder-Wilson 1991, 126&lt;/ref&gt; Glass production seemingly ceased to exist in [[Persia]] and [[Mesopotamia]], and little is known about the reasons for this.&lt;ref name="Israeli 2003, 321"/&gt; However, in the earlier part of this period, there is evidence for glass-making in [[Central Asia]], for example at Kuva in modern [[Uzbekistan]].&lt;ref&gt;Ivanov 2003, 211–212&lt;/ref&gt; This tradition presumably ended with the Mongol invasions of the mid-13th century that destroyed other sites in the region.&lt;ref&gt;Anarbaev and Rehren 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The glass-producing regions of [[Syria]] and [[Egypt]] continued their industries. It is for the materials excavated and produced at sites such as [[Samsat]] in southern [[Turkey]],&lt;ref&gt;Redford 1994&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aleppo]] and [[Damascus]] in [[Syria]],&lt;ref&gt;Pinder-Wilson 1991, 131&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hebron]] in the [[Levant]],&lt;ref name="Spaer 1992, 46"&gt;Spaer 1992, 46&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Cairo]]&lt;ref name="Carboni 2001, 323"&gt;Carboni 2001, 323&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Israeli 2003, 231&lt;/ref&gt; that this period is referred to as the 'Golden Age' of Islamic glass. The Middle Islamic Period is characterized by the perfection of various polychrome decorative traditions, the most important of which are marvering, [[enamelling]], and [[gilding]], while relief-carving and [[Lustre (mineralogy)|lustre]] painting seemingly fell out of fashion.&lt;ref&gt;Pinder-Wilson 1991, 126–130&lt;/ref&gt; Marvering involves applying a continuous trail of opaque glass (in various colours such as white, red, yellow, or pale blue) around the body of a glass object. This trail may then be manipulated by pulling it, creating a characteristic 'wavy' pattern. The object was then rolled on a marver (a stone or iron slab) to work the trail into the glass vessel itself.&lt;ref name="Carboni 2001, 291"&gt;Carboni 2001, 291&lt;/ref&gt; This technique, used on a variety of glass objects from bowls and bottles to chess pieces, was introduced around the late 12th century AD,&lt;ref name="Carboni 2001, 291"/&gt; but is in fact a revival of a much older glass-working tradition that has its origins in the [[Late Bronze Age]] in [[Egypt]]&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tatton-Brown and Andrews 1991, 26&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Container Umar II Louvre OA7448.jpg|thumb|left|Jar with the name of a sultan of [[Yemen]], probably Syria or Egypt, 1290s]]

[[Gilding]] during this period involved applying small amounts of gold in suspension onto a glass body, followed by a low firing to fuse the two materials, and was adopted from [[Byzantine]] traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Pinder-Wilson 1991, 130&lt;/ref&gt; This technique was often combined with enamelling, the application of ground glass with a colourant, to traditional and new vessel forms, and represents the height of Islamic glassmaking.&lt;ref&gt;Carboni 2001, 323–325&lt;/ref&gt; [[Enamelling]], a resurrection of older techniques, was first practiced in the Islamic world at [[Raqqa]] (Syria) during the late 12th century, but also spread to [[Cairo]] during [[Mamluk]] rule.&lt;ref name="Carboni 2001, 323"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gudenrath 2006, 42&lt;/ref&gt; A study of various enamelled vessels, including beakers and [[mosque lamp]]s, suggests that there are two subtle yet distinct firing practices, possibly representing two distinct production centres or glass-working traditions.&lt;ref name="Gudenrath 2006, 47"&gt;Gudenrath 2006, 47&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its high demand, enamelled glass was exported throughout the Islamic world, Europe, and China during this period.&lt;ref name="Pinder-Wilson 1991, 135"&gt;Pinder-Wilson 1991, 135&lt;/ref&gt; [[Enamelling]] eventually ended in [[Syria]] and [[Egypt]] following disruption by various Mongol invasions from the 13th through to the 15th centuries AD.&lt;ref&gt;Israeli 2003, 376&lt;/ref&gt;

A final note on glass from the Middle Islamic Period is the increased interaction between the Middle East and Europe. The [[Crusades]] allowed for the European discovery of Islamic gilded and enamelled vessels. The 'Goblet of the Eight Princes' brought to [[France]] from the [[Levant]] is one of the earliest examples of this technique.&lt;ref name="Pinder-Wilson 1991, 135"/&gt; Furthermore, large amounts of raw plant ash were exported solely to [[Venice]], fuelling that city's glass industries.&lt;ref&gt;Jacoby 1993&lt;/ref&gt; It was also in [[Venice]] that enamelling was resurrected following its decline in the Islamic world.&lt;ref name="Gudenrath 2006, 47"/&gt;

==Late Islamic glass: 15th to mid-19th century AD==
The Late Islamic Period is dominated by three main empires and areas of glass production; the [[Ottomans]] in Turkey, the [[Safavid]] (and later the Zand and [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]]) Dynasty in [[Persia]], and the [[Mughals]] in northern [[India]].&lt;ref name="Pinder-Wilson 1991, 136"&gt;Pinder-Wilson 1991, 136&lt;/ref&gt; The most important over-riding characteristic of glass production in this period is the "direct influence of European glass" and, in particular, that of [[Venice]], [[Bohemia]] (in the 18th century), and the Dutch.&lt;ref name="Carboni 2001, 371"&gt;Carboni 2001, 371&lt;/ref&gt; The production of high-quality fine glass essentially ended in Egypt, Syria, and Persia, and it was only in [[India]] during the 17th century that Islamic glass regained a high level of artistic expression following European influence.&lt;ref name="Carboni 2001, 371"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Markel 1991, 82–83&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of court patronage for glassmaking and the high quality of European glass contributed to a decline in the industry; however, utilitarian glass was still being made in the traditional centres.&lt;ref name="Pinder-Wilson 1991, 136"/&gt;
[[File:BLW Ewers.jpg|thumb|A group of 19th century Persian ewers]]

Historical documents and accounts, such as the ''Surname-i Humayun'', show the presence of glassmaking, and a glassmaker's guild, in [[Istanbul]], as well as production at [[Beykoz]] on the coast of the [[Bosphorus]], in the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The glass made at these centres was not of great quality and was highly influenced by Venetian and Bohemian styles and techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Pinder-Wilson 1991, 137&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Persia]], evidence for glassmaking following the Mongol invasions of the 13th century does not reappear until the [[Safavid]] period (17th century). European travellers wrote accounts of glass factories in [[Shiraz]], and it is thought that transplanted Italian craftsmen brought about this revival.&lt;ref&gt;Carboni 2001, 374&lt;/ref&gt; No significant decorative treatments or technical characteristics of glass were introduced or revived during this period in Persia. Bottle and jug forms with simple applied or ribbed decoration, made from coloured transparent glass, were common, and are linked to the Shirazi wine industry.&lt;ref&gt;Carboni 2001, 374–375&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mughal (tribe)|Mughal]] glassmaking in India, on the other hand, saw a return to the enamelling and gilding traditions from the Middle Islamic Period, as well as the glass–carving techniques used in Persia during the earliest centuries of the Islamic world.&lt;ref&gt;Pinder-Wilson 1991, 138&lt;/ref&gt; Glass workshops and factories were initially found near the Mughal capital of [[Agra]], Patna (eastern India), and in [[Gujarat]] province (western India), and by the 18th century had spread to other regions in western India.&lt;ref&gt;Markel 1991, 83&lt;/ref&gt; New forms were introduced using these older Islamic glass-working techniques, and of these, ''[[nargileh]]'' (water pipe) bases became the most dominant.&lt;ref&gt;Markel 1991, 84&lt;/ref&gt; Square bottles based on Dutch forms, decorated with enamelling and gilding in Indian motifs, are another important expression in Mughal glassmaking, and were produced at [[Bhuj]], [[Kutch]], and in [[Gujarat]].&lt;ref&gt;Carboni 2001, 389&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Markel 1991, 87&lt;/ref&gt; Ethnographic study of current glass production in [[Jalesar]] shows fundamental similarities between this site and the Early Islamic tank furnaces found in the [[Levant]], despite differences in the shape of the structures (round in India, rectangular at Bet She'arim), highlighting the technological continuity of the glass industry throughout the Islamic period.&lt;ref&gt;Sode and Kock 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roles of Islamic glass==

While the various functions of Islamic glass have been touched upon during the previous discussion (mosque lamps from the Middle Islamic Period, wine bottles from Safavid Persia, ''[[nargileh]]'' bases from Mughal India), glass filled a multitude of roles throughout the history of the Islamic world. A variety of vessel forms used to hold a wide range of materials make up the bulk of glass objects (bowls, goblets, dishes, perfume bottles, etc.), and have seen the most attention from Islamic glass scholars (Carboni 2001; Israeli 2003; Kröger 1995; Pinder-Wilson 1991; Scanlon and Pinder-Wilson 2001). Some of the more distinct vessel functions from the Islamic period include [[inkwells]] (Israeli 2003, 345), ''qumqum'' or perfume sprinklers,&lt;ref&gt;Carboni 2001, 350–351&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Israeli 2003, 378-382&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pinder-Wilson 1991, 128–129&lt;/ref&gt; and vessels associated with Islamic science and medicine such as [[alembics]], test-tubes, and cuppers.&lt;ref&gt;Carboni 2001, 375&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Israeli 2003, 347&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kröger 1995, 186&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pinder-Wilson 2001, 56–60&lt;/ref&gt; Glass was also used for aesthetic purposes in the form of decorative figurines,&lt;ref&gt;Carboni 2001, 303&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Israeli 2003, 383&lt;/ref&gt; and for jewellery as bracelets (Carboni 1994; Spaer 1992) and beads.&lt;ref&gt;Scanlon and Pinder-Wilson 2001, 119–123&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Spaer 1992, 46"/&gt; The bracelets, in particular, may prove to be an important archaeological tool in the dating of Islamic sites.&lt;ref&gt;Spaer 1992, 54&lt;/ref&gt; Glass also filled various utilitarian roles, with evidence of use as windows,&lt;ref&gt;Kröger 1995, 184&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scanlon and Pinder-Wilson 2001, 61&lt;/ref&gt; and as coin weights.&lt;ref&gt;Schick 1998, 95&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whitehouse 2002, 195&lt;/ref&gt; The variety of functions filled by glass and the sheer bulk of the material found through excavation further highlights its significance as a distinct and highly developed material industry throughout the Islamic world.

==Study of Islamic glass==
Islamic glass from this period has been given relatively little attention by scholars. One exception to this was the work carried out by Carl J. Lamm (1902–1987).&lt;ref&gt;Israeli 2003, 322&lt;/ref&gt; Lamm catalogued and classified the glass finds from important Islamic sites; for example [[Susa]] in Iran (Lamm 1931), and at [[Samarra]] in Iraq (Lamm 1928). One of the most important discoveries in the field of Islamic glass was a shipwreck dated to around 1036 AD on the Turkey coast at Serçe Liman. The recovered cargo included vessel fragments and glass cullet exported from Syria.&lt;ref&gt;Pinder-Wilson 1991, 114&lt;/ref&gt; The significance of these finds lies in the information they can tell us about the production and distribution of Islamic glass. Despite this, the majority of studies have concentrated on stylistic and decorative classification (Carboni 2001; Kröger 1995; Lamm 1928; Lamm 1931; Scanlon and Pinder-Wilson 2001), and as such technological aspects of the industry, as well as undecorated vessels and objects, have often been overlooked within the field. This, in particular, is frustrating because the majority of glass finds during the Islamic period are undecorated and used for utilitarian purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Carboni 2001, 139&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Bible-related |perspectives}}

The '''Islamic view of the Christian Bible''', which Christians hold to be revelations from God, is based on the belief that the [[Qur'an]] says that parts of [[Bible]] are a [[revelation]] from [[God in Islam|Allah]] ([[God]]), but believe that some of it has become distorted or corrupted (''[[tahrif]]''), and that a lot of text has been added which was not part of the revelation. [[Muslims]] believe the Qur'an, which Muslims hold to be a revelation to the [[Prophets and messengers in Islam|Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad in Islam|Muhammad]], was given as a remedy and that it identifies three sets of books from the Bible as genuine divine revelation given to [[Prophets and messengers in Islam|trusted messengers]]: the ''[[Torah in Islam|Tawrat]]'' (''[[Torah]]'') given to [[Moses in Islam|Musa]] ([[Moses]]), the ''[[Zabur]]'' (''[[Psalms]]'') given to [[David in Islam|Daud]] ([[David]]) and the ''[[Gospel in Islam|Injil]]'' (''[[The gospel|Gospel]]'') given to [[Jesus in Islam|Isa]] ([[Jesus]]). They believe that the Qur'an, these books, and the ''[[Suhuf Ibrahim]]'' (''"Scrolls of Abraham"'', which they believe is currently lost){{fact|date=July 2017}} together constitute [[Islamic holy books|Islam's scripture]]. Belief that this scripture is [[Revelation|divinely inspired]] is one of [[Iman (concept)|Islam's fundamental tenets]], and traditional Muslim teaching stresses those passages in the Qur'an which affirm the Christian Gospel and the Hebrew Torah as valid revelations of God and paths to salvation.

Early Muslims held multiple perspectives in regard to the Bible.

== Islamic Views ==

=== Torah (''Tawrat'')===
{{main article|Tawrat|Torah}}

The Qur'an mentions the word Torah eighteen times and confirms that it was The Word Of God.  However, they believe that there have been additions and subtractions made to the Torah. The early Qu'ran exeget [[Tabari]] referred to the Torah from the Jewish as "the Torah that they possess today".&lt;ref&gt;Camilla Adang. ''Muslim Writers on Judaism and the Hebrew Bible: From Ibn Rabban to Ibn Hazm''. BRILL, 1996. {{ISBN|978-9-004-10034-3}}. page 231.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psalms (''Zabur'') ===
{{main article|Zabur|Psalms}}

[[Sura]] [[An-Nisa]] 4:163 of the Qur'an states "and to David We gave the Psalms". Therefore, Islam claims the Psalms as being inspired of God. The Qur'an mentions the word Zabur three times (Qur'an 17:55; 21:105)

=== Gospel (''Injil'') ===
{{main article|Gospel in Islam|Gospel}}

When the Qur'an speaks of the Gospel, it is believed to refer to an original divine revelation from [[Jesus Christ]]. The canonical Gospels from the bible are commonly assumed not to be the original teachings of Jesus or were corrupted over time. Some scholars suggested the original Gospel may be the [[Gospel of Barnabas]].&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Leaman ''The Qur'an: An Encyclopedia'' Taylor &amp; Francis 2006 {{ISBN|978-0-415-32639-1}} page 298&lt;/ref&gt;

== Muhammad and the Bible ==
{{main article|Muhammad in the Bible}}

=== Deuteronomy 18:18 ===
{{quote|I will raise up a prophet from among their countrymen like you, and I will put My words in his mouth, and he shall speak to them all that I command him. It shall come about that whoever will not listen to My words which he shall speak in My name, I Myself will require it of him. 20 But the prophet who speaks a word presumptuously in My name which I have not commanded him to speak, or which he speaks in the name of other gods, that prophet shall die.'|Deuteronomy 18:18-20 ([[New American Standard Bible]])|source=}}

Deuteronomy 18:18 has often been considered a prophecy of Muhammad by Muslim scholars.&lt;ref name=Dammen&gt;McAuliffe, Jane Dammen. "Connecting Moses and Muhammad" in ''Books and Written Culture of the Islamic World: Studies Presented to Claude Gilliot on the Occasion of his 75th Birthday'' (Brill 2014): 335.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Al-Samawal al-Maghribi]], a medieval Jewish mathematician who converted to Islam, pointed to Deuteronomy 18:18 in his book ''Confutation of the Jews'' as a prophecy fulfilled by Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;al-Maghribi, Al-Samawal; ''Confutation of the Jews'' (in Arabic). Syria: Dar Al Qalam, 1989, 75&lt;/ref&gt; Samawal argued in his book that since the children of Esau are described in Deuteronomy 2:4-6 and Numbers 20:14 as the brethren of the children of Israel, the children of Ishmael can also be described the same way.&lt;ref&gt;al-Maghribi, Al-Samawal; ''Confutation of the Jews'' (in Arabic). Syria: Dar Al Qalam, 1989, 77&lt;/ref&gt; Some Muslim writers, like [[Muhammad Ali (writer)|Muhammad Ali]] and [[Fethullah Gülen]], have interpreted several verses in the Quran as implying that Muhammad was alluded to in Deuteronomy 18:18, including Quran 46:10 and 73:15.&lt;ref&gt;Muhammad Ali and Zahid Aziz, [https://archive.org/details/EnglishTranslationOfTheHolyQuran English Translation of the Holy Quran: With Explanatory Notes], Revised 2010 edition, 627, 732&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gülen, Fethullah. The messenger of God Muhammad: An analysis of the Prophet's life. Tughra Books, 2000, 11. [https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/30583495/The-Messenger-of-God-Muhammad-An-Analysis-of-the-Prophets-Life.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;Expires=1542003237&amp;Signature=7FnvB4YWltdtwNZTRpfEnxLiPCg%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DMessenger_of_God_An_Analyses_of_the_life.pdf Link]&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians interpret Deuteronomy 18:18 as referring to a future member of the community of Israel who reenacts the function of Moses, serving as act as a mediator for the covenant between [[YHWH]] and the Israelites. [[Walter Brueggemann]] writes that "The primary requirement for the prophet, like
the king in 17:15, is that he or she must be a member of Israel, thoroughly situated in the traditions and claims of the Yahwistic covenant."&lt;ref&gt;Brueggemann, Walter. ''Deuteronomy''. Abingdon Press, 2001, 192-197&lt;/ref&gt; The Gospels of Matthew and John both make Jesus out to be the prophet like Moses from Deuteronomy 18.&lt;ref&gt;Barton, John, and John Muddiman, eds. The Oxford Bible Commentary. Oxford University Press, 2007, 866, 963.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Paraclete ===
{{Main|Paraclete}}	
{{quote|I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Helper, that He may be with you forever; 17 that is the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not see Him or know Him, but you know Him because He abides with you and will be in you.|John 14:16-17}}
 
Many Muslim scholars have argued that the Greek words ''paraklytos'' (comforter) and ''periklutos'' (famous/illustrious) were used interchangeably, and therefore, these verses constitute Jesus prophesying the coming of Muhammad.&lt;ref name=zepp&gt;Zepp, Ira G. A Muslim Primer: Beginner's Guide to Islam. Vol. 1. University of Arkansas Press, 2000, 50-51&lt;/ref&gt;

Critical scholarship recognizes that the Paraclete, or Advocate, is mentioned five times throughout John's Gospel (John 14:16-17; 14:26; 15:26-27; 16:7-11; 16:13-17). The Advocate, called the "Spirit of Truth" is considered the Holy Spirit; a replacement for Jesus into the world after Jesus leaves, still dependent on Christ (14:6) and sent by the Father at Jesus' demand (14:16, 24). The Spirit is said to permanently remain with the disciples (14:18-21). John's Gospel says that the world cannot receive the Spirit though the Spirit can abide within the disciples (14:17). The Spirit will accuse the world of sin (16:9) and glorify Jesus (16:14), and though it is 'the spirit that gives life', the spirit does not add new revelations to those of Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;Barton, John, and John Muddiman, eds. The Oxford Bible Commentary. Oxford University Press, 2007, 987-990&lt;/ref&gt;

== Qur'anic references to other persons in the Bible ==
{{main article|List of persons in both the Bible and the Qur'an|Biblical narratives and the Qur'an|Prophets of Islam}}

Some of the people revered in both the Qur'an and the Bible include: [[Aaron]], [[Cain and Abel|Abel]], Abraham, [[Adam]], Cain, [[David]], [[Apostle (Christian)|the disciples of Jesus]], [[Elijah|Elias]], [[Elisha]], [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]], [[Eve]], [[Ezra]], [[Goliath]], [[Isaac]], [[Ishmael]], [[Jacob]], Jesus, [[John the Baptist]], [[Jonah]], [[Joseph (son of Jacob)|Joseph]], [[Judeo-Christian views of Lot|Lot]], [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]], Moses,  [[Noah]], the [[Pharaoh|Pharaohs of Egypt]], [[Samuel]], [[Saul]], [[Solomon]],  and [[Zechariah (priest)|Zacharias]].&lt;ref name="Dawood"&gt;''The Koran'', [[N.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6385">'''Jacob of Ancona''' (or '''Jacob d'Ancona''') is the name that has been given to the supposed author of a book of travels, purportedly made by a scholarly Jewish merchant who wrote in vernacular Italian, an account of a trading venture he made, in which he reached [[China]] in 1271, four years before [[Marco Polo]].  The narrative contains political debates about the future of the city in which he engaged with the aid of a translator of mixed Italian and Chinese ancestry.

==Missing manuscript==
The Italian manuscript from which [[David Selbourne]], an  Englishman residing in Italy, professed to have made his translation, published as ''The City of Light: The Hidden Journal of the Man Who Entered China Four Years Before Marco Polo'', has not come to light, even in photocopies; its possessor still remains anonymous. Selbourne asserts that "provenance and rights of ownership over it are unclear," motivating its owner's desire for anonymity.

==Doubts==
In 1997, [[Little, Brown and Company]] was prepared to publish the diary, under the title ''The City of Light'' in the United States. The house had just published the book in the UK when word spread that China scholar [[Jonathan Spence]], the [[Sterling Professor]] of History at Yale, had written a book review for ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;ref&gt;It was published as "A leaky boat to China," 19 October 1997; Spence's review detailed several doubtful aspects of Selbourne's alleged translation: "the reader is thrown back on the English of the translated text as it is presented here. Such a reading does not do much to increase our confidence." Among unlikely aspects Spence noted: the author's two female servants, suggesting "a convenient device for enriching the action with unwanted pregnancy, forced abortion and shrill complaint, "the prominence of sexual themes, the extended philosophical debates which bear "traces of all sorts of narrative genres and traditions".&lt;/ref&gt; that questioned the book's authenticity. Despite growing pressure, David Selbourne has continued to refuse to make the original manuscript available for public scrutiny. At the last minute,  in September 1997, Little, Brown and Co. pulled the diary from US publication, scheduled for 3 November.&lt;ref name="query.nytimes.com"&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9802E6D7173CF93AA35751C1A961958260 Doreen Carvajal, " Marco Polo: Is a Rivalry Just Fiction?", ''The New York Times'', 9 December 1997] Accessed 16 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

T. H. Barrett, School of Oriental and African Studies, in ''[[London Review of Books|The London Review of Books]]'', 30 October 1997, described the text as a forgery; he noted that the garbled name ''Baiciu'' for a famous rebel "was only known to the narrator of the account in a form which derived from an 18th-century misreading of an Arabic manuscript— as good a proof as any that something is badly amiss."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lrb.co.uk/v20/n24/letters.html Barrett, "Sino-Jewish Relations", letter to LRB '''20'''.24, 10 December 1998]&lt;/ref&gt; Roz Kaveny, reviewing the book in ''New Statesman''&lt;ref&gt;Kaveny's review in ''New Statesman'' '''126''' (24 October 1997) p 45.&lt;/ref&gt; noted that "By coincidence, much of what Jacob d'Ancona dislikes in 13th-century China is what David Selbourne dislikes in late-20th century Britain" and thought that she recognized in the dialectical principles with which d'Ancona controverts his ideological opponents close parallels with Selbourne's own rhetorical techniques. She concluded that one might prefer "to suppose that the dilemma, and the document, are mirages, that his book is a [[Postmodernism|postmodernist literary device]]."

In December 2007 a University of London professor read a public lecture "The Faking of 'The City of Light'", to which he neglected to invite Selbourne. [[Bernard Wasserstein]], president of the Oxford Center for Hebrew and Jewish Studies, and his brother, David, professor of Islamic history at Tel Aviv University publicly called attention to an anachronism, Jacob's arrival at a ''[[mellah]]'' in the [[Persian Gulf]], a descriptive for a [[ghetto]] based on the root for "salt", that was not used until the 15th century, in Morocco.&lt;ref name="query.nytimes.com"/&gt;

The first writer to come forward to support the text's authenticity in public was the right-wing journalist [[Melanie Phillips]], who took issue with Barrett in the ''Sunday Times'', 8 October 1998, and who responded, as did Selbourne, to Barrett's letter to ''LRB''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lrb.co.uk/v21/n01/letters.html Melanie Phillips, David Selbourne, letters, ''LRB'' '''21'''.1, 7 January 1999.]&lt;/ref&gt; Selbourne further responded with a "Preface to the American Edition" (Lightning Source, 2003) when the [[Kensington Books|Kensington imprint]] Citadel Press published ''The City of Light: the Hidden Journal of the Man Who Entered China Four Years Before Marco Polo'' in 2000. A Chinese translation was published in Shanghai, December 1999, under the direction of Prof. Li Xue Qin, Academy of Social Sciences, Selbourne reported.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

In [[Confucianism]], the ideal personality is the ''sheng'', translated as [[sage (philosophy)|sage]]. However, sagehood is hard to attain and so Confucius created the ''junzi'', gentleman, which more individuals could achieve. [[Zhu Xi]] defined ''junzi'' as second only to the sage. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Junzi'' has many characteristics. ''Junzi'' can live with [[poverty]]; ''Junzi'' does more and speaks less. A ''junzi'' is [[Loyalty|loyal]], obedient and knowledgeable. ''Junzi'' disciplines himself. Among these, ''[[Ren (Confucianism)|ren]]'' is the core of becoming ''junzi''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jds.cass.cn/Item/1390.aspx 君子——儒学的理想人格 (Gentleman - Ideal Personality of Confucianism)]&lt;/ref&gt;{{zh icon}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

As the potential leader of a nation, the son of the ruler is raised to express superior ethical and moral positions while gaining inner peace through virtue. To Confucius, the ''junzi'' sustained the functions of government and social stratification through his ethical values. Despite its literal meaning, any righteous man willing to improve himself can become a ''junzi''.

By contrast the ''xiaoren'' ({{linktext|小人}}, ''xiăorén'', "small or petty person") does not grasp the value of virtues and seeks only immediate gain. The petty person is [[egotistic]] and does not consider the consequences of his actions. Should the ruler be surrounded by ''xiaoren'' as opposed to ''junzi'', his governance and his people will suffer due to their small-mindness. Examples of such ''xiaoren'' individuals can range from those who continually indulge in sensual and [[emotion]]al pleasures to the career [[politician]] who is interested merely in [[Power (social and political)|power]] and [[Celebrity|fame]]; neither sincerely aims for the long-term benefit of others.

The ''junzi'' rules by acting virtuously himself. It is thought that his pure [[virtue]] would lead others to follow his example. The ultimate goal is that [[Government of China|government]] behaves much like [[family]]. Thus at all levels [[filial piety]] promotes harmony and the ''junzi'' acts as a beacon for this piety.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1754">'''Jón Ólafsson of Grunnavík''' (''Jón Ólafsson frá Grunnavík'', also known as ''Jón Grunnvíkingur'' or ''Grunnavíkur-Jón'', 1705–1779) was an Icelandic scholar. Originally  from [[Grunnavík]], [[Westfjords]], northwestern [[Iceland]], he was active in [[Copenhagen]], where he served as assistant to [[Árni Magnússon]].

He is the author of an Icelandic dictionary and a 1732 ''Runologia'', a treatise on [[runology]].  As in the [[Copenhagen Fire of 1728|fire of Copenhagen]] of 1728, the original manuscript of the ''[[Heiðarvíga saga]]'' was lost along with a recent copy made by Jón Grunnvíkingur, he wrote down a summary of the saga from memory, which is the only form in which the saga's contents survive today.

The character of ''Jón Grindvicensis'' in [[Halldór Laxness]]'s historical novel  ''[[Iceland's Bell]]'' is based on Jón Grunnvíkingur.

The '''League of Libyan Ulema''' (({{lang-ar|رابطة علماء ليبيا}} {{transl|ar|''Rabitah al Ulema Līb(i)yā''}}) is a representative group of leading religious scholars from Libya.

==Background==
The League of Libyan Ulema is an association of Libya's most senior traditional Muslim scholars. It has grown and expanded from its origins as an informal network of Muslim scholars that spontaneously emerged during the early days of the Libyan revolution the [[Network of Free Ulema - Libya]]. The group were one of the very first to publicly come out against the Gadaffi regime, issuing a fatwa that saw revolution as a religious duty.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://blogs.reuters.com/faithworld/2011/02/21/libyan-islamic-scholars-issue-fatwa-for-muslims-to-rebel/ | title = Libyan Islamic scholars issue fatwa for Muslims to rebel | publisher = Reuters| date = 21 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The League was formally inaugurated on 6 February 2012 in [[Tripoli]]. It is headed by Sheikh Dr Umar Abdul Hamid al Mawlud and includes of a scholarly council of senior Sheikhs. The League represents the traditional Azhari line of Asha'ri, Maliki, Junaidi schools, but also includes [[Ibadi]] scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.almanaralink.com/press/2012/02/رابطة-علماء-ليبيا-تنتقد-قانون-دار-الاف/ | title = رابطة علماء ليبيا تنتقد قانون دار الافتاء | publisher = almanaralink | place = Libya | date = 26 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
Since its establishment the scholars have held a number of meetings and have issued a document providing a detailed critique on the Dar al-Ifta decree recently passed by the NTC in Libya. This is a 13-page document which generated considerable attention and discussion in religious and government circles in Libya.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://freeulema.org/communiques/RabitaDocument_DarIftaaDecree3.pdf | title = League of Libyan Ulema Document on the Dar al-Ifta Decree | publisher = Network of Free Ulema | place = Libya | date = 23 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dubious or Fictitious===
{{Main|Blood libel}}
[[William of Norwich]] was a twelve year old English boy whose unsolved murder was, at the time, attributed to the Jewish community of Norwich. It is the first known medieval accusation against Jews of ritual murder. [[E. M. Rose]] points out that road robberies and kidnappings gone wrong were a frequent cause of death in the region during the period of [[The Anarchy]] when the Crown struggled to safeguard the roads.&lt;ref&gt;[https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-murder-of-william-of-norwich-9780190219628?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp; Oxford University Press: ''The Murder of William of Norwich''] retrieved October 4, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by a similar allegation regarding the unexplained death of [[Harold of Gloucester]]. An attempt to establish a cult of Harold seems to have been unsuccessful. It was never officially supported and died out long before the Reformation.&lt;ref name = "hil"&gt;Hillaby, Joe, "The ritual-child-murder accusation: its dissemination and Harold of Gloucester", Jewish Historical Studies, vol. 34, (1994-1996), pp. 69-109.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it established a pattern. Any unexplained child death occurring near the Easter festival was arbitrarily linked to Jews in the vicinity.&lt;ref&gt;Hillaby, Joe, "The ritual-child-murder accusation: its dissemination and Harold of Gloucester", Jewish Historical Studies, vol. 34, (1994-1996), pp. 69-109.&lt;/ref&gt; In some instances promotion of a cult may have been influenced by the interest of local clergy to enhance the prestige of their church with a shrine. Anthony Bale suggests this, and local politics, may have been contributing factors to the cult of [[Robert of Bury]].&lt;ref&gt;Bale, A. "House Devil, Town Saint", in Delany, Sheila, ''Chaucer and the Jews'', Routledge, 2013, p.185 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Simon of Trent]] and [[Werner of Oberwesel]]&lt;ref name="bld" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} [[:de:Werner von Oberwesel|Werner von Oberwesel]]&lt;/ref&gt; are other examples of individuals who died under unknown circumstances, but whose deaths were nonetheless attributed to the Jews.

[[Little Saint Hugh of Lincoln]] was never actually canonised, making the moniker "Little Saint Hugh" a misnomer. He never appeared in [[Alban Butler|Butler's ''Lives of the Saints'']], the [[Holy See|Vatican]] never included the child Hugh in Catholic martyrology, and his traditional English feast day is not celebrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Editors, Catholic Saints|2013}}, {{harvnb|Butler|1910}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of [[Dominguito del Val]],&lt;ref name=Gil&gt;[https://historiaragon.com/2017/08/31/el-martirio-de-santo-dominguito-de-val/ Gil, Sergio Martinez. "The Martyrdom of Santo Domenguito de Val", Historia de Aragon]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Andreas Oxner]],&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} [http://www.santiebeati.it/dettaglio/91670 Blessed Andreas (Oxner) of Rinn]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gabriel of Białystok]], and the [[Holy Child of La Guardia]] it is not clear that the alleged victim ever existed in the first place.

'''[[Venerable]] Macarius of the Yellow Water Lake and [[Unzha River|the Unzha]], the Miracle Worker''' (1349–1444) ({{lang-ru|Преподобный Макарий Унженский Желтоводский Чудотворец}}, Prepodobny Makariy Unzhenskiy Zheltovodskiy Chudotvorets)  is a [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]] [[saint]]. He is credited with the founding of four monasteries in the Middle and Upper Volga regions of Russia.

==The Life of Venerable Macarius==
The story of saint Macarius is based on ''Chet’yi-Minei'' (the standard [[Hagiography#Hagiography in Eastern Orthodoxy|Russian Orthodox ''Lives of the Saints'']]) as well as to other old manuscripts. One of them, kept in [[Makaryev Unzhensky Monastery]], was first inventoried in 1835. The other is kept in [[Makaryev Monastery|Makaryev Zheltovodsky Convent]], and is written in the 17th century [[paleography|hand]].

Church scholars believe that he was most likely born in 1349. His home town, [[Nizhny Novgorod]], was the capital of the [[Principality of Suzdal and Nizhny Novgorod]], ruled by Prince [[Constantine Vasilyevich]]. As most other Russian principalities of the time, his land was dominated by the [[Golden Horde]] overlords.

Macarius was baptised in his parents' parish church, Church of Holy [[Myrrhbearers]] ({{lang-ru|церковь Святых Жен Мироносиц}}). His [[baptism]]al name is not known.

According to the ''Life of St. Macarius'', when he was still a baby, he would start crying every time he heard the ringing of the bells of the nearby church. There was no way to console the child. The parents would not want to bring the baby boy to the church, afraid that he would disturb the service with his crying; but eventually they decided to try. And, to their surprise, as soon as they brought the child to the church, he became quiet, smiling joyfully. From this time on, the parents had to attend every service at the parish church, and to take the child with them, because if they stayed at home during the service, the baby would again start crying.

Macarius grew as a pious boy, especially interested in the lives of the Orthodox [[hermit]]s of the past ages, living in the wilderness alone or in small [[lavra]] communities. For that reason, he enjoyed visiting not only his parish church, but also [[Pechersky Ascension Monastery]], which had been recently founded by [[Saint Dionysius of Suzdal|Saint Dionysius]] (later known as Saint Dionysius of [[Suzdal]], the archbishop) who had come to Nizhny Novgorod from the famous [[Kiev Pechersk Lavra|Kiev Pechersky (Cave) Lavra]]. At the age of 12, he sneaked out of his parents' house and joined [[Pechersky Ascension Monastery]], and received  the [[monk|monastic]] name of Macarius ({{lang-ru|Макарий}}, Makariy). He became one of the twelve disciples of St. Dionysius, and was known for the strictness of his fast and the fervency of his prayer.

In 1374, St. Dionysius was appointed the archbishop of [[Suzdal]] and Nizhny Novgorod and left the monastery. Soon, Macarius left the monastery too. He travelled up the [[Volga]], spent some time with St. Tikhon on the [[Lukh River]], and then founded a monastery in honor of [[Epiphany (Christian)|Epiphany]] of Jesus Christ (now Makaryev Reshma Monastery, Макариев-Решемский мужской монастырь, near the village of [[Reshma]] in today's [[Kineshma]] district or [[Kostroma Oblast]]).

[[File:MakarievMonastery-4.jpg|thumb|The modern [[Makaryev Monastery]] is much better fortified than in 1439]]
He did not stay long in his new monastery, however. He wanted to live in the wilderness as a hermit. He travelled down the Volga, and liked the site at the Yellow Water Lake (Желтоводское озеро, Zheltovodskoe Ozero), near the fall of the [[Kerzhenets River|Kerzhenets]] into the Volga, some one hundred kilometers downstream from [[Nizhny Novgorod]]. In those days, this was no-man's land between the Russian principalities, and the [[Kazan Khanate]].

Macarius dug a small cave by the waters of the Yellow Water Lake, and stayed there day and night, emulating the great hermits of the past. However, his solitude did not last long: pious people from far and wide came to his hermitage, some to seek his blessing, others to join him in hermetic life. In 1434, he founded [[Makaryev Monastery|Zheltovodsky Makariev Monastery of Holy Trinity]] for his disciples.

The asceticism of Venerable Macarius, together with his love of his neighbors, attracted not only Christians but also many local pagan [[Mordvin people|Mordvin]], [[Mari people|Mari]], [[Chuvash people|Chuvash]] and [[Muslim]] [[Tatar]] people. He baptised many in Yellow Water Lake.

In 1439, the monastery was [[Russo-Kazan Wars|destroyed during the invasion of Russia]] by the [[List of Kazan khans|khan]] [[Olug Moxammat of Kazan]]. Most of the monks were killed; Macarius and a few other Christians were taken to [[Kazan]] as prisoners. The khan, impressed by the pious life of
the nonagenarian abbot, released him and a few other Christian prisoners, and allowed him to bury the killed.

On the way back from [[Kazan]] to the Yellow Water Lake, Macarius is said to have stopped at a site near today's [[Sviyazhsk]], blessing the future location of [[Makaryev Sviyazhsk Monastery]]. However, Macarius and his companions were not allowed to stay at the Yellow Water Lake site. He decided to leave a safe distance between themselves and the [[Kazan Khanate|Khanate]], and went to the forests of the  [[Unzha River]], a few hundred kilometers north of the [[Nizhny Novgorod|Nizhny]]. It is a long way, and the travellers soon run out of food, but were miraculously saved from starvation (Venerable Macarius' [[Miracle of the Moose]]). Once they reached the Unzha, still in 1439, Macarius and his party founded [[Unzhensky Makaryev Monastery]] (now a [[convent]]).

According to legend, Macarius lived in his new monastery for a few more years, healing the sick and expelling devils from possessed people. He died on [[July 25 (Eastern Orthodox liturgics)|July 25]] 1444, at the age of 95, after an 83-year monastic career. After the two famous cloisters he founded, he is called Venerable Macarius of Yellow Water Lake and [[Unzha]], the Miracle Worker.

==Canonization==
After the death of Macarius, a wooden church was built over his grave, and the Unzha monastery was named after him. The locals often reported being miraculously healed of various diseases after visiting his grave; his help was said to have repelled a [[Kazan Khanate|Tatar]] invasion, and later, during the [[Time of Troubles]], to protect the region against the Polish troops. The fame of the founder attracted pilgrims and novices to the monasteries, helping its growth.

When [[Patriarch Filaret (Feodor Romanov)|Feodor Romanov]], the father of Russia's new Csar [[Michael I of Russia|Michael]], is enthroned as [[Patriarch of Moscow|Patriarch Philaret of Moscow]]  in 1619, he sends a commission to the Unzha to investigate the miracles. He mentions these miracles as confirmed in his letter to his son the Csar in September 1619, and encourages Michael to visit Macarius' Unzha Monastery  in fulfillment of the vow he had given earlier (which Michael promptly does). It is thought that it was at that time that Venerable Macarius was canonized by a [[Synod#Orthodox usage|Sobor]] of the Russian Orthodox Church, which made his veneration nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;\ [[Macarius Bulgakov|Metropolitan Macarius of Moscow and Kolomna]], [http://rus-sky.com/church_his/mak5103.htm ''The History of Russian Church'', Vol. 9, Chapter 3] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Holy Relics==
[[File:C0045-Macarius-Lenin.jpg|thumb|The Honorable Head of Venerable Macarius is visiting Kstovo on August 4, 2007]]
The Holy [[Relics]] of Venerable Macarius were discovered in 1671, during a burial in the church where his body had been buried.
After several years of disagreements as to whether the relics were genuine, and some minor miracles that convinced disbelievers that they were, they were put to rest in a [[reliquary]] in Unzhensky Makaryev Monastery. In 1929, Soviet authorities closed the monastery, and most of the relics ended up in the local history museum at [[Yuryevets, Ivanovo Oblast]], where they were kept in storage until 1990, when they were return to [[Kostroma]] [[Eparchy]] (diocese). In 1995, these relics (bones and vestments) were brought back to Unzhensky Makaryev Monastery.

The head of Macarius, however, was missing. It was not until 2005 that the [[Eparchy]] (Archdiocese) of Nizhny Novgorod was contacted by a priest who had inherited the Head (or most of it, at any rate) from his brother, also a priest, who in his turn had saved it from the [[Bolshevik]]s some time after the closing of the Unzhensky Makaryev Monastery in 1929.  The priests had reverently kept the relics in their homes for many years, until they felt secure that the Russian Church is reborn and is restoring Macarius' monasteries. After the special commission of the archdiocese, with the forensic experts' help,
established genuineness of the relics, their return was celebrated at a special service in the Holy Saviour Cathedral in the [[Nizhny Novgorod Kremlin]] on March 23, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nne.ru/events.php?id=116 "Meeting the Honorable Head of Venerable Macarius"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061111140932/http://nne.ru/events.php?id=116 |date=2006-11-11 }}(The Archdiocese of Nizhny Novgorod; 23 March 2006) {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Since then, the Head was kept in a special portable reliquary in [[Pechersky Ascension Monastery]] in Nizhny Novgorod, which the clerics can reverently take with them on a visit to a nursing home&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pecherskiy.nne.ru/news.php?id=9 The Reliquary of the Honorable Head of Venerable Macarius is visiting [[Sormovsky City District|Sormovo]] Nursing Home]

On the occasion of Macarius' feast in 2007, the Honorable Head of Venerable Macarius was permanently [[translation (relics)|transferred]] from Nizhny Novgorod to Makaryev Zheltovodsky Monastery (Convent). The transfer took place during August 3–7, 2007. The prized relic, accompanied by Archbishop Georgy of Nizhny Novgorod and Arzamas and other  ecclesiastical officials of Nizhny Novgorod [[Eparchy]], was transported down the Volga by the boat "Alexander Peresvet" during August 3–7, 2007, with stopovers in [[Bor, Nizhny Novgorod Oblast|Bor]], 
[[Kstovo]] and [[Lyskovo]]. [[Krestny khod|Religious processions]] were organized in the cities visited,
to carry Macarius' head from the Volga docksides to local churches for appropriate celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Macarius is considered the [[patron saint]] of [[artisan|craftsmen]], [[merchant]]s, and travellers, as well as of [[Makariev Fair]]. He is especially venerated in the Archdioceses ([[Eparchy|Eparchies]]) of [[Nizhny Novgorod Oblast|Nizhny Novgorod]], [[Ivanovo Oblast|Ivanovo]], and [[Kostroma Oblast|Kostroma]]—the lands where he performed his earthly works.

In some monasteries, such as [[Pechersky Ascension Monastery]] in Nizhny Novgorod, one can request a prayer to Venerable Macarius for success in business or "getting out of poverty" (избавление от нищеты).&lt;ref&gt;The list of services that could be ordered (Требы) posted at Pechersky Ascension Monastery, as seen in August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Abrahamic religions]], the '''Messianic Age''' is the future period of time on Earth in which the [[messiah]] will reign and bring universal [[peace]] and [[Brotherly love (philosophy)|brotherhood]], without any [[evil]]. Many believe that there will be such an age; some refer to it as the consummate "[[kingdom of God]]" or the "[[world to come]]".

== Judaism ==
According to Jewish tradition, the Messianic Era will be one of global peace and harmony, an era free of strife and hardship, and one conducive to the furtherment of the knowledge of the Creator. The theme of the [[Messiah in Judaism|Messiah]] ushering in an era of global peace is encapsulated in two of the most famous scriptural passages from the [[Book of Isaiah]]:
{{quote|
They shall beat their [[swords to plowshares|swords into plowshares]] and their spears into pruning hooks; nation will not lift sword against nation and they will no longer study warfare.|Isaiah 2:4}}
{{quote|The wolf will live with the lamb, the leopard will lie down with the goat, the calf and the lion and the yearling together; and a little child will lead them. The cow will feed with the bear, their young will lie down together, and the lion will eat straw like the ox. The infant will play near the hole of the cobra, and the young child put his hand into the viper's nest. They will neither harm nor destroy on all my holy mountain, for the earth will be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea.|Isaiah 11:6-9}}

In his [[Mishneh Torah]], [[Maimonides]] describes the Messianic Era:
:"And at that time there will be no hunger or war, no jealousy or rivalry. For the good will be plentiful, and all delicacies available as dust.
:The entire occupation of the world will be only to know God... the people Israel will be of great wisdom; they will perceive the esoteric truths and comprehend their Creator's wisdom as is the capacity of man. As it is written (Isaiah 11:9): "For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of God, as the waters cover the sea."&lt;ref&gt;Mishneh Torah, Laws of Kings 12:5&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Talmud]],&lt;ref&gt;Babylonian Talmud Rosh Hashana 31a and Sanhedrin 97a&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Midrash]],&lt;ref name="Rabbi Eliezer 1981, p. 141"&gt;Pirke De Rabbi Eliezer, Gerald Friedlander, Sepher-Hermon Press, New York, 1981, p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; and the ancient Kabbalistic work, the [[Zohar]],&lt;ref&gt;Zohar (1:117a) and Zohar Vayera 119a&lt;/ref&gt; the Messiah must arrive before the [[year 6000]] from the time of creation. In Orthodox Jewish belief, the [[Hebrew calendar]] dates to the time of creation, making this correspond to the year 2240 on the [[Gregorian calendar]].

The Midrash comments:
"Six eons for going in and coming out, for war and peace. The seventh eon is entirely [[Shabbat]] and rest for life everlasting."&lt;ref name="Rabbi Eliezer 1981, p. 141"/&gt;

There is a kabbalistic tradition&lt;ref&gt;Zohar, Vayera 119a&lt;/ref&gt; that maintains that each of the seven days of the week, which are based upon the seven days of creation, correspond to the seven millennia of creation. The tradition teaches that the seventh day of the week, the [[Biblical Sabbath|Sabbath]] day of rest, corresponds to the seventh millennium, the age of universal 'rest' - the Messianic Era. The seventh millennium perforce begins with the year 6000, and is the latest time the Messiah can come. Supporting and elaborating on this theme are numerous early and late Jewish scholars, including Rabbeinu [[Bahya ibn Paquda|Bachya]],&lt;ref&gt;Bachya on Genesis 2:3&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abraham ibn Ezra]],&lt;ref&gt;Ramban quoting Ibn Ezra at Leviticus (25:2)&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Nahmanides|Ramban]],&lt;ref&gt;Ramban on Genesis (2:3)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Isaac Abrabanel]],&lt;ref&gt;Abarbanel on Genesis 2&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Moshe Chaim Luzzatto|Ramchal]],&lt;ref&gt;Derech Hashem 4:7:2&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Vilna Gaon]],&lt;ref&gt;Safra D'Tzniusa, Ch. 5&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aryeh Kaplan]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7vxjgVY33LkC&amp;pg=PA318&amp;lpg=PA318&amp;dq=aryeh+kaplan+1840&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2_mGLTFniN&amp;sig=6dCWdOjPDl-YAyELmmdj-FBMHg0&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=GQo0TI6UOZSqcYaq0bsD&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Page 318, The Real Messiah, online access]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Lubavitcher Rebbe]].&lt;ref&gt;Sefer HaSichos 5750:254&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Hasidic Judaism]], event that marked a start of the building of the messianic era was destruction of the [[Temple in Jerusalem|2nd Temple]] by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] in 70 CE and by subsequent times of the exile. They last until today. According to Yehuda Leib Schapiro, dean of the Yeshiva Gedola Rabbinical College of Greater Miami, what was old had to be destroyed to give room to the construction of the New Messianic Temple and to the future revelation of Ha-Shem that will surpass anything which is known until now. That is the meaning of the festival of [[Tisha B'Av]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= https://www.chabad.org/multimedia/media_cdo/aid/3392253/jewish/The-Chassidic-Approach-to-the-Three-Weeks-and-Tisha-BAv.htm  |title= The Chassidic Approach to the Three Weeks and Tisha B’Av.

== Christianity ==
[[File:Apocalypse vasnetsov.jpg|thumb|right|[[Viktor Vasnetsov]], the [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]]]]
{{See also|Messiah#Christianity|Christian eschatology}}

Christian understanding of the messianic age heavily depends on [[Tanakh|Jewish Scriptures]], especially [[Nevi'im|the Prophets]]. The characteristic of the messianic age, as shown in the Scriptures, was to be an extraordinary outpouring of the Spirit on all people. It should bring them special gifts and charisms. Most eminent prophecies are found in the [[Book of Zechariah]] 4:6b; 6:8 and the [[Book of Joel]] 3:1-2 (cf. Nb 11:29). [[Acts of the Apostles]] refer to them proclaiming that the word of the prophets was made flesh in Jesus on the day of Pentecost. Now, "he has received from the Father the Holy spirit, who was promised." (Acts 2:16-21.17.33) According to [[Isaiah]], the messianic age was to have its anointed leader, the Messiah, who would be filled with the gifts of the spirit to be able to accomplish his saving work. (Is 11:1-3; 42:1; 61:1; see also Mt 3:16)&lt;ref name = NJB/&gt;

Jesus used miracles to convince people that he was inaugurating the messianic age. (cf.Mt 12:28). Scholars have described Jesus' miracles as establishing the kingdom during his lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The New Jerome Biblical Commentary, ch. 78:20; 81:106,112,113,117|last=Brown, et al|first=Raymond E.| authorlink = Raymond E. Brown | publisher=Prentice Hall|year=1990|isbn=0-13-614934-0|location=Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey|pages=|chapter=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Book of Ezekiel]], apart from bestowing special charismatic gifts, the Spirit would build the messianic age in the hearts of people by exercising their inward renewal resulting in exceptional adherence to the Law of God (cf. Ezk 11:19; 36:26-27; 37:14; Ps 51:12-15; Is 32:15-19; Zc 12:10). According to the [[Book of Jeremiah]], messianic times would be sealed by the ''new covenant'', final and eternal one, written ″on their hearts″ (Jr 31:31). Paul spoke about that new covenant in his [[Second Epistle to the Corinthians]] 3:6. [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] used the image of the life-giving water "poured out on the thirsty soil". People, "like willows on the banks of a stream" would have access to the Spirit which would enable them to bring fruits of integrity and holiness (Is 44:3) The [[Gospel of John]] would refer to that in the meeting of Jesus with [[Samaritan woman at the well|the Samaritan woman at the well of Jacob]]: "the water that I shall give will become a spring of water within, welling up for eternal life." (Jn 4:14) Ezekiel would say that the holiness of the people would in turn be met by special love, favour and protection from God: "I will make a covenant of peace" and "set up my sanctuary among them for ever." (Ezk 37:24; 39:29)&lt;ref name = NJB&gt;{{Cite book|title= The New Jerusalem Bible | chapter = Footnote f to Ezk 36:27| place = London | publisher = Darton, Longman &amp; Todd| year = 1985| page = 1451}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christian eschatology]] points out to gradual character of the Messianic Age. According to [[realized eschatology]], the Messianic Era, a time of universal peace and brotherhood on the earth, without crime, war and poverty, to some extent, is already here. With the [[crucifixion of Jesus]] the Messianic Era had begun, but according to [[inaugurated eschatology]] it will completed and brought to perfection by the [[parousia]] of Christ.&lt;ref name=Ladd70&gt;[[George Eldon Ladd]], ''A Theology of the New Testament'' (1993) {{ISBN|0-8028-0680-5}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=eIdkM00EdlAC&amp;pg=PA70 page 70].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past, the messianic age was sometimes interpreted in terms of [[Millenarianism]]. The [[Book of Revelation]] 20:2-3 gives an image of a 1000-year period in which Satan is to be bound so that he cannot influence those living on the Earth, and Jesus Christ will reign on the Earth with resurrected saints.  After that Satan will be defeated once and for all, the Earth and heaven will pass away,  and people will face judgment by Jesus Christ to determine whether or not they will enter the new heaven and earth that will be established. (Revelation 21)

According to the [[Nicene Creed]] (381), professed by most [[Christians]], after his [[Ascension of Jesus|ascension]], [[Session of Christ|enthronement]] at the [[Right hand of God]], the time will come when Jesus will [[Second Coming|return]] to fully establish the [[Kingdom of god#Christianity|Kingdom of God]] of the [[World to Come#Christian eschatology|World to Come]].

== Islam ==
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2011}}
The Quran states that [[Jesus in Islam|Isa ibn Maryam]] (Jesus, son of Mary) was the [[Messiah]] or "Prophet" sent to the Jews.{{Cite quran|3|45}} Muslims believe he is alive in Heaven, and will return to Earth to defeat the [[Masih ad-Dajjal]], an [[anti-messiah]] comparable to the Christian [[Antichrist]] and the Jewish [[Armilus]].

A [[hadith]] in [[Abu Dawud]] (37:4310) says:
{{quote|
Narrated Abu Hurayrah: The Prophet said: There is no prophet between me and him, that is, Jesus. He will descend (to the earth). When you see him, recognise him: a man of medium height, reddish hair, wearing two light yellow garments, looking as if drops were falling down from his head though it will not be wet. He will fight for the cause of Islam. He will break the [[crucifix|cross]], kill the swine, and put an end to war (in another tradition, there is the word [[Jizyah]] instead of Harb (war), meaning that he will abolish jizyah); God will perish all religions except Islam. He [Jesus] will destroy the Antichrist who will live on the earth for forty days and then he will die. The Muslims will pray behind him.}}

Both [[Sunni]] and [[Shia]] Muslims agree [[Mahdi|Imam Mahdi]] will arrive first, and after him, Jesus. Jesus will proclaim that the true leader is al-Mahdi. A war, literally [[Jihad]] (Jihade Asghar) will be fought—the [[Dajjal]] (evil) against al-Mahdi and Jesus (good). This war will mark the approach of the coming of the Last Day. After Jesus slays al-Dajjāl at the Gate of Lud, he will bear witness and reveal that Islam is the true and final word from God to humanity as [[Abdullah Yusuf Ali|Yusuf Ali]]'s translation reads:{{Cite quran|4|159|translator=y}}
{{quote|And there is none of the People of the Book but must believe in him before his death; and on the Day of Judgment He will be a witness against them.― (159)}}

He will live for several years, marry, have children and will be buried in Medina.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

A hadith in [[Sahih Bukhari]] (Sahih al-Bukhari, 4:55:658) says:
{{quote|Allah's Apostle said "How will you be when the son of Mary descends amongst you and your Imam is from amongst you."}}

Very few scholars outside of Orthodox Islam reject all the quotes (Hadith) attributed to Muhammad that mention the second return of Jesus, the Dajjal and Imam Mahdi, believing that they have no Quranic basis. However, Quran emphatically rejects the implication of termination of Jesus’ life when he was allegedly crucified. Yusuf Ali's translation reads:
{{quote|That they said (in boast), "We killed Christ Jesus the son of Mary, the Messenger of Allah";― but they killed him not, nor crucified him, but so it was made to appear to them and those who differ therein are full of doubts, with no (certain) knowledge, but only conjecture to follow, for of a surety they killed him not. (157) Nay, Allah raised him up unto Himself; and Allah is Exalted in Power, Wise. (158){{Cite quran|4|157|e=158}}}}

{{quote|So Peace is on me the day I was born, the day that I die and the day that I shall be raised up to life (again).{{Cite quran|19|33}}}}

Many classical commentators such as [[Ibn Kathir]], [[At-Tabari]], [[al-Qurtubi]], [[Suyuti]], al-Undlusi (Bahr al-Muhit), Abu al-Fadl al-Alusi (Ruh al-Maani) clearly mention that verse 43:61 of the Qur'an refers to the descent of Jesus before the Day of Resurrection, indicating that Jesus would be the Sign that the Hour is close.

{{quote|And (Jesus) shall be a Sign (for the coming of) the Hour (of Judgment): therefore have no doubt about the (Hour)...{{Cite quran|43|61}}}}

=== Ahmadiyya ===
In [[Ahmadiyya Islam]], the present age (the Messianic age) has been a witness to the wrath of God with the occurrence of the World Wars and the frequency of natural disasters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aaiil.org/text/books/others/mirzamasumbeg/propheciespromisedmessiah/propheciespromisedmessiah.pdf |title=Prophecies of the Promised Messiah -- www.aaiil.org|format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Ahmadiyya, [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad|Ghulam Ahmad]] (d.1908) is seen as the [[Second coming|promised Messiah]] whose Islamic teachings will establish spiritual reform and ultimately establish an age of peace upon earth. This age continues for around a thousand years as per Judeo-Christian prophecies; and is characterised by the assembling of mankind under one faith that is Islam as per Ahmadiyya belief.&lt;ref&gt;''The Review of Religions'', January 2009, Vol.104, issue 1. p. 18-22&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bahá'í Faith ==
In the [[Bahá'í Faith]], the "Messianic Age" refers to a 1000-year period beginning with the Declaration of [[Bahá'u'lláh]] in 1863.  Bahá'ís believe the period of peace and prosperity is gradually unfolding and will culminate in the appearance of "[[Bahá'í prophecies#The Most Great Peace|The Most Great Peace]]".

'''Missionary kids''' (or '''MKs''') are the children of [[missionary]] parents, and thus born and/or raised abroad (that is, on the "mission-field"). They form a subset of [[third culture kids]] (TCKs). The term is more specifically applied when these children return to their "home" or passport country (the country of their citizenship), and often experience various difficulties identifying with fellow citizens and integrating "back" into their "home" culture. The resulting feeling is described as "reverse [[culture shock]]".

There is some confusion between the terms MK and TCK. According to the definition developed by [[Ruth Hill Useem]], TCKs are people who have spent a significant part of their developmental years outside their parents' culture.&lt;ref&gt;''Third Culture Kids'', pp. 21–23&lt;/ref&gt; TCK is a broad term that encompasses all children who have grown up abroad (i.e. military kids, diplomats' kids, immigrants). Missionary kids are just one of the many categories of kids who qualify as TCKs. Therefore, while all MKs are TCKs, not all TCKs are MKs.

In the past MKs usually were thought of{{by whom|date=September 2014}} only as American or European, but there is {{as of | 2014 | lc = on}} a growing number of MKs from other countries, especially Protestant Christian MKs from [[South Korea]]&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.intervarsity.org/ism/article/346 Increase of non-Western missionaries] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060529025134/http://www.intervarsity.org/ism/article/346 |date=2006-05-29 }}&amp;nbsp;— by InterVarsity Christian Fellowship/USA. (accessed 2007-04-04).
&lt;/ref&gt; and from [[Latin America]]. Generally, this term applies to [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Christians]];{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}; however, it can be applied to any [[Religious denomination|denomination]] of a religion.

==Definition==

===Life overseas===
While MKs often identify more with the culture or country where they were raised (and this could be multiple cities, countries, or continents) than with where their parents were raised, they are not fully at home in any one culture. [[David C. Pollock]] and Van Reken attribute this feeling of displacement, or rootlessness, to a lack of emotional connection to their home culture (where they "should" feel connected).&lt;ref&gt;''Third Culture Kids'', pp. 123&lt;/ref&gt; Many MKs find it difficult to answer questions about where they are from or where home is as they may feel more of an emotional connection to their host culture than to their "home" culture. However, at the same time many MKs are completely aware that they can never fully fit into their host culture. This is especially obvious to MKs growing up in countries where they look different from the local population. Pollock and Van Reken developed the PolVan Cultural Identity Model to explain cultural identity in relationship to the surrounding culture. The Model names four categories into which a person can fall based on how they look and think compared to the culture around them:&lt;ref&gt;''Third Culture Kids'' pp. 54–56&lt;/ref&gt;
;Foreigner : look ''different'', think ''different''
;Adopted : look ''different'', think ''alike''
;Hidden Immigrant : look ''alike'', think ''different''
;Mirror : look ''alike'', think ''alike''

When MKs first transition to their new or "host" culture, they are in the foreigner category. As they continue the transition and begin to acclimate and feel at home in their host culture, MKs move into the adopted category, often to the point where MKs feel more at home in the host culture than in their passport culture. At this point, the host culture becomes the MK's home culture. Upon returning to their passport culture, MKs often find themselves in the hidden immigrant category. Because they look like their peers, their extended family remembers how they were prior to their international move and expect them to hold similar views and to act as a typical citizen of that passport country would act. However, as hidden immigrants, MKs look like their family and friends, but more often than not hold many differing views and opinions. Additionally, MKs may not be aware of many of the pop culture influences within their passport country, yet are aware of world and regional issues, which most citizens of their passport country are unaware of. This cultural disconnect can cause awkwardness when they return to their passport country.&lt;ref&gt;*Klemens &amp; Bikos, p. 721&lt;/ref&gt;

Children in the MKs' passport countries often find it difficult to relate to missionary children, and vice versa. While MKs may find the lives of their peers in their passport countries to be boring, sometimes creating challenging social situations, passport country kids may be intimidated by MKs' experience abroad. Cultural miscommunications are common and interesting. While MKs often find it difficult to relate to people from their home culture or target culture, they get along with other MKs very well, even those who are missionaries to (or from) a completely different country. It is the commonality of differences that draws MKs together.

MKs tend to be open-minded and tolerant of many diverse cultures. They often feel more at home in culturally rich environments and can be "homesick" for their foreign home. Their knowledge of a country and its culture typically exceeds language fluency. Upon returning to their passport country, MKs possess unique skills that can be helpful to academics and governments. Because of their international experience, they often have a much broader worldview than their peers. This broader worldview can also lead to mixed emotions about their passport country and its foreign policies.

===Return to passport country===
Children who immigrate to the United States have similar experience to MKs when it comes to learning a new culture and making cross-cultural transitions. But according to Pollack and Van Reken, what truly distinguishes MKs from children who immigrate to the United States or other countries is "the full expectation that after living for a significant period of their developmental years outside their passport culture, there will  come the day when TCKs make a permanent return to that country and culture."&lt;ref&gt;''Third Culture Kids'' p 225&lt;/ref&gt; MKs return to their passport country for many reasons, including the beginning of their college education, a shift in their parents' career, and even evacuation in more extreme cases. Extended family and friends's excitement at MKs' return does not usually carry over to the MK. The events surrounding an MK's return may be traumatic (such as in the event of an evacuation due to political unrest), but even under normal circumstances MKs' return to their country of citizenship is a cause of stress and grief. Anxiety and depressions are the two emotions most commonly associated with cross-cultural transitions, caused by a sense of vulnerability and loss of control.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Headley, et al. p 187&lt;/ref&gt;

To help MKs cope with the transition back to the United States, many colleges, particularly Christian colleges, have chapters of a student organization called "Mu Kappa International".&lt;ref&gt;[http://mukappa.org Mu Kappa International website]&lt;/ref&gt; Mu Kappa aims to help MKs and other TCKs with the transition to American culture and college life. Mu Kappa was founded in 1985 at [[Taylor University]], and has since spread to more than forty other American colleges and universities.

Another frequently used method of helping MKs cope with transitioning from their foreign home to their passport culture is through transition seminars. These seminars typically take place during the summer before an MK's freshman year of college and teach MKs the basics of everyday life in America, including putting gas in a car, opening a bank account, grocery shopping, and many other every day tasks.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Headley, et al. p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, these seminar can help MKs understand how to deal with the grief of permanently transitioning back to their passport country in a healthy way, and how to manage the stress of a new environment and reverse culture shock.

The '''Office of Special Affairs''' or '''OSA''' (formerly the '''Guardian's Office''') is a department of the [[Church of Scientology International]]. According to the Church, the OSA is responsible for directing legal affairs, public relations, pursuing investigations, publicizing the Church's "social betterment works," and "oversee[ing its] social reform programs". Some observers outside the Church have characterized the department as an [[intelligence agency]], comparing it variously to the [[CIA]] or the [[KGB]].&lt;ref&gt;Wakefield, Margery [http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Library/Shelf/wakefield/us-12.html Understanding Scientology]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cisar, Joe (translator) [http://www.lermanet.com/cisar/books/trn1053.htm The Guardian Office (GO)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hamburg Regional Office of the German Constitutional Security Agency [http://fhh.hamburg.de/stadt/Aktuell/behoerden/inneres/landesamt-fuer-verfassungsschutz/publikationen/pdf-bibliothek/scientology-organisation-pdf,property=source.pdf Der Geheimdienst der Scientology-Organisation - Grundlagen, Aufgaben, Strukturen, Methoden und Ziele - Zweite Auflage, Stand 06.05.1998"]&lt;/ref&gt;  The department has targeted critics of the Church with [[Scientology controversy#"Dead agenting"|dead agent]] operations and [[character assassination]].&lt;ref name="woods3"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,,292357,00.html ''Scientologists pay for libel''], Clare Dyer, [[The Guardian]], 9 June 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="On the Offensive"&gt;{{cite news | first=Joel | last=Sappell |author2=Welkos, Robert W. | url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-scientology062990x,1,5622544,full.story?coll=la-news-comment | title=On the Offensive Against an Array of Suspected Foes | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | page=A1:1 | date=1990-06-29 | accessdate=2006-08-02}} Additional convenience link at {{cite web |url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Library/Shelf/la90/la90-6a.html |title=? |author= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure and personnel ==
At local Scientology organizations, directors (Special Affairs, Legal, Public Affairs) are OSA staff members. Local Directors of Special Affairs are known as DSAs.  Members of the Office of Special Affairs are drawn from the [[Sea Org]].&lt;ref name="ebner"&gt;{{cite book

In addition to regular staff, some church members also act as volunteer collaborators for the office, which cuts down on private investigation and legal research expenses.&lt;ref&gt;Ortega, Tony (Sept. 9, 2001).

&lt;/ref&gt;  Most branches of the Church of Scientology soon had at least one member from the Guardian's Office on its staff, and the Guardian's Office itself had its own secret Intelligence Bureau at the top of its organizational structure.&lt;ref name="davis" /&gt;  The Guardian's Office was disbanded in 1983, and the bulk of its previous functions were then assigned to the Office of Special Affairs.&lt;ref name="davis" /&gt;

Garry Scarff has said that he used to be an OSA operative.  He has made a number of  statements about the inner workings of OSA, many of which are disputed by the Church.  In a sworn deposition taken between July and August 1993 and submitted in ''Church of Scientology International vs. Steven Fishman and Uwe Geertz'', Scarff testified, "...I was directed, one, to go to Chicago, Illinois and to murder Cynthia Kisser, Cynthia Kisser being the Executive Director of the [[Cult Awareness Network]], by a staged car accident." Kisser was not killed, and Scarff said: "I could not bring myself to harm or kill anybody."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Deposition of Gary Scarff in ''Church of Scientology International vs. Steven Fishman and Uwe Geertz'' |url=http://bogie.home.xs4all.nl/dunkle_seite/scarff.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722095431/http://bogie.home.xs4all.nl/dunkle_seite/scarff.html|archivedate=22 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tory Christman]], a former volunteer for OSA has stated that the organization hired private investigators, fabricated criminal charges and harassed their targets, including at their place of employment, as well as their family members.&lt;ref&gt;Christman, Tory [http://www.torymagoo.org/trapwork.htm How the OSA trap really works] March 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

It didn't work, but it was amazing to me to see how far they will go. They harass people who speak out against Scientology, and their families and sometimes at their work force." --&gt;

[[Bonnie Woods]], a former member who began counselling people involved with Scientology and their families, became a target along with her husband in 1993 when the Church of Scientology started a leaflet operation denouncing her as a "hate campaigner" with demonstrators outside their home and around [[East Grinstead]]. She and her family were followed by a private investigator, and a creditor of theirs was located and provided free legal assistance to sue them into bankruptcy. After a long battle of libel suits, in 1999 the church agreed to issue an apology&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.escapeint.org/legal/apology.htm Apology to Bonnie Woods from the Church of Scientology and other defendants, 8 June 1999]&lt;/ref&gt; and pay £55,000 damages and £100,000 costs to the Woods.&lt;ref name="woods3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culteducation.com/reference/scientology/Scien140.html|title=Stars' cult pays out £155,000 over hate campaign|author= Richard Palmer|work=''[[Daily Express|The Express]]''|date= 8 June 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nancy Many was a high-level GO operative during [[Operation Freakout]], and in a 2013 television interview for ''Dangerous Persuasions'' on the [[Discovery Channel]], described intimate details of the operation to harass [[Paulette Cooper]], including her own personal involvement.

==History==
Pancharatra has likely roots in 3rd-century BCE, as a religious movement around the ideas of a sage [[Narayana]] who is an avatar of [[Vishnu]].&lt;ref name=britpancharatra/&gt;&lt;ref name="JonesRyan2006p321"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Constance Jones|author2=James D.

The earliest use of the word Pancharatra is found in section 7.1.10 of the ''Taittiriya Samhita'', a Vedic text.&lt;ref name="Dalal2010p293"/&gt; The section describes a person going through a Pancharatra ritual to become a master of rhetorics.&lt;ref name="Dalal2010p293"&gt;{{cite book|author=Roshen Dalal|title=Hinduism: An Alphabetical Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DH0vmD8ghdMC |year=2010|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=978-0-14-341421-6|page=293}}&lt;/ref&gt; The section 13.6 of the ''[[Shatapatha Brahmana|Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa]]'' mentions Nārāyaṇa as the primordial divinity who performs this offering.&lt;ref name="JonesRyan2006p321"/&gt; The Narayaniya section of the [[Mahabharata]] (XII, 335-351) refers to seven rishis who say the Pancharatra system was made consistent with the Vedas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/29942414|title=Studies in the Purāṇic records on Hindu rites and customs|last=1905-1982.|first=Hazra, R.

Lochtefeld|title= The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism: N-Z|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=g6FsB3psOTIC |year=2002|publisher =The Rosen Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-8239-3180-4|page=493}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement merged with the ancient Bhagavata tradition also around Krishna-Vasudeva, and contributed to the development of [[Vaishnavism]].&lt;ref name=britpancharatra/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gonda1977p39"/&gt;

According to [[J. A. B. van Buitenen]], the word "Pancharatra" is explained in ''Naradiya Samhita'' as referring to a tradition of "five knowledges".&lt;ref name=buitenen291/&gt; Similarly, [[Jan Gonda]] states that the term "nights" in "five nights" in the Pancharatra tradition may be a metaphor for inner darkness, and "came to mean – how, we do not know", though indeed there have been many interpretations such as "five systems", "five studies" and "five rituals".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jan Gonda|title= Medieval Religious Literature in Sanskrit |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XEkqAAAAYAAJ |year= 1977|publisher= Harrassowitz|isbn= 978-3-447-01743-5|pages= 46–50 with footnotes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1st-century works by Shandilya are the earliest known systematization of the Pancharatra doctrine.&lt;ref name="JonesRyan2006p321"/&gt;&lt;ref name=britpancharatra/&gt; This doctrine was known and influential around then, as is attested by the 2nd-century CE inscriptions in South India.&lt;ref name=britpancharatra/&gt; Evidence suggests that they co-existed with the Bhagavata tradition in ancient times.&lt;ref name="Lochtefeld2002p493"/&gt;

The [[Advaita Vedanta]] scholars, such as [[Adi Shankara]], criticized elements of the Pancharatra doctrine along with other theistic approaches stating it was against monastic spiritual pursuits and non-Vedic.&lt;ref name=britpancharatra/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chatterjee2008p107"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=S. Krishnaswami Aiyangar|title=Some Contributions of South India to Indian Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vRcql-QBhRwC|year=1995|publisher=Asian Educational Services|isbn=978-81-206-0999-0|pages=284–285}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Suthren Hirst, Shankara supported the use of icons and temple worship if it focussed as a means to comprehend [[Brahman]] as the sole metaphysical reality. However, he opposed devotional theism as an end in itself and the goal of spiritual pursuits.&lt;ref name="Chatterjee2008p107"/&gt; The Pancharatra tradition has historically disagreed with claims of it being non-Vedic, states Gonda, and Pancharatra texts explicitly state that, "Pancharatra is Vedic, it originates in the [[Sruti]]" and that the "Pancharatra precepts and practices should be observed by anyone who has allegiance to the Vedas".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jan Gonda|title=Medieval Religious Literature in Sanskrit|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XEkqAAAAYAAJ| year=1977| publisher =Harrassowitz| isbn=978-3-447-01743-5|pages=49–50 with footnotes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 11th-century [[Ramanuja]], the influential [[Sri Vaishnavism]] scholar, was born in Pancharatra tradition, disagreed with Shankara, and developed a qualified monism doctrine which integrated ideas of Pancharatra movement and those of monistic ideas in the Vedas.&lt;ref name="Glucklich2008p178"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=S. Krishnaswami Aiyangar|title=Some Contributions of South India to Indian Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vRcql-QBhRwC|year=1995|publisher=Asian Educational Services|isbn=978-81-206-0999-0|page=285}}, Quote: "The establishment of the teaching of the Pancharatra as Vedic in character and as one form of Vaishnavism was one of the achievements of Ramanuja".&lt;/ref&gt; Ramanuja stated that the Vishnu of Pancharatra is identical to Vedanta's [[Brahman]], where Purusha reflects the eternal soul that is Vishnu, and Prakriti the impermanent ever changing body of Vishnu.&lt;ref name="Glucklich2008p178"/&gt;

[[Vishnu]] worshipers of today, represented in a wide spectrum of traditions, generally follow the system of Pancharatra worship. The concept of Naḍa and Naḍa-Brahman appear already in Sāttvata [[Samhita]] or Sāttvata Tantra and in Jayākhya Samhita, two texts considered most canonical of Pancharatra texts.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

[[Madhvacarya|Ānanda Tīrtha]] the founder of Madhva line has written in his commentary on [[Mundaka Upanishad]]:
&lt;ref&gt;dvapariyair janair viṣṇuḥ pancarātrais ca kevalam
kalau tu nāma-mātreṇa pujyate bhagavan hariḥ&lt;/ref&gt;
"In Dvāpara-yuga, [[Vishnu]] is exclusively worshiped according to the principles of the Pancharatra Scripture, but in this age of [[Kali Yuga|Kali-yuga]], the Supreme Lord Hari is worshiped only by the chanting of his Holy Name."{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

[[Jiva Gosvami]] had stated in his ''Paramātma Sandārbha'', forming part of six principal Sandārbhas, or philosophical treatises of [[Gaudiya Vaishnavism]], that, "Seeing that the imperfect scriptures in the modes of passion and ignorance bring only a host of troubles, and also seeing that the original [[Veda]]s are very difficult to follow properly, and thus being very dissatisfied with both of these, the all-knowing scripture authors affirm the superiority of the Pancharatras, which describe the pure absolute truth, [[Narayana]], and the worship of the Lord, which is very easy to perform."{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

The Pancharatra theology developed over time. It presents a dualistic theory on how creation manifested from a godhead, as the Purusha-Prakriti and as the masculine-feminine manifestations of the divine.&lt;ref name="JonesRyan2006p321"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lochtefeld2002p493"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jacobsen2008p130"&gt;{{cite book|author=Knut A.

It arranged into Saṅkarṣaṇa ([[Balarama]])&lt;ref name="Dalal2010p293"/&gt; as the lord over all life, then Pradyumna creating mind, and Aniruddha as ego (''ahamkara''). Thereafter, Brahma emerged from Aniruddha who created the empirical universe. Thus, the divinity was and is everywhere in Pancaratra, but in different aspects, one form or phase emerging from the previous.&lt;ref name="JonesRyan2006p321"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lochtefeld2002p493"/&gt;

During the 11th century AD [[Ramanuja]], a founder of [[Sri Vaishnava]] traditions of Vaisnavism had established the Pancharatra system of Vaisnavism for his followers. His philosophy of worship of [[Narayana]] was based on the pancaratric teachings.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Ramanuja taught that the deity absolute, [[Parabrahman]], manifests in five possible aspects: Para, [[Vyuha]], Vibhava, [[Antaryamin]], and Archa. Living beings can interact with the divine through one or another of these five:&lt;ref&gt;Siddheshwar R Bhatt (1968), ''The Philosophy of the Pancharatra: Advaitic Approach'', Ganesh, page 38-41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nandithak135/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Roshen Dalal|title=Hinduism: An Alphabetical Guide |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DH0vmD8ghdMC |year=2010|publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0-14-341421-6|pages=458–459 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Para: the invisible, formless, eternal supreme;
*Vyuha: the invisible, impermanent supreme in form;
*Avatara: also called the ''vaibhava'', are the incarnations of the supreme in various ''yuga'' (eras in Hindu cosmology) such as the [[Dashavatara]];
*Antaryamin: not directly perceptible but can be inferred, the aspect of supreme whose presence can be felt by the devotee;
*Archa: visible icon form, filled with symbolism, consecrated in temples or revered images inside home (Shalagrama, conch shell, festive decorations), a means to remember and meditate on the supreme.

===Influence===
The Vyuha-related Pancharatra theology is a source of the primary and secondary [[avatar]]-related doctrines in traditions of [[Hinduism]], particularly [[Sri Vaishnavism]].&lt;ref name="Lochtefeld2002p493"/&gt; According to Barbara Holdrege, a professor and comparative historian of religions, the Pancharatra doctrines influenced both Sri Vaishnavism and [[Gaudiya Vaishnavism]], albeit a bit different.&lt;ref name="Holdrege2015p73"/&gt; In Sri Vaishnavism, Vishnu-Narayana is supreme, while Vasudeva, Samkarsana, Pradyumna and Aniruddha are the four Vyuhas. In Gaudiya Vaishnavism, the Vyuha theory is more complex, Krishna is "Svayam Bhagavan" (the ultimate, Brahman) who manifests as Vyuhas, and he along with Samkarsana, Pradyumna and Aniruddha are the Vyuhas and the Purusha-avataras of the material realm.&lt;ref name="Holdrege2015p73"&gt;{{cite book|author=Barbara A.

The significance of divine manifestation theology in Pancaratra tradition is it believes that an understanding of the process by which Vishnu-Narayana emerged into empirical reality and human beings, can lead one to reverse the process. Through practicing the reversal and moving from the empirical to ever more abstract, according to Pancaratra, human beings can access immanent Vasudeva-Krishna and thereby achieve salvific liberation ([[moksha]]).&lt;ref name="Lochtefeld2002p493"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mitsunori MATSUBARA (1994), The Concept of Vasudeva as the Hindu Bhagavat, Journal of Esoteric Buddhism, Vol. 184, pp. L158-L157, context: L164-L157, {{doi|10.11168/jeb1947.1994.L164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Temples===
The Vaishnava temples and arts since the [[Gupta Empire]], states Doris Srinivasan, attempted to present the Pancaratra ideas. In this system, states Srinivasan, "Vasudeva, literally, "the indwelling deity," is the first emanation and the fountainhead of the successive emanations, which may be represented either anthropomorphically or theriomorphically in Hindu art". As one circumambulates the ancient and medieval Vaishnava cave temples, the devotee walks past from the icon representing Vasudeva (most abstract) and then the successive ''Vyuhas'' (literally, "orderly arrangement").&lt;ref name=doriss39/&gt;

== Pancharatra Texts ==
The Bhaktisūtras of Shandilya were one of the earliest systematic treatises on the Pancaratra doctrine.&lt;ref name="JonesRyan2006p321"/&gt;&lt;ref name=britpancharatra/&gt; The Pancaratra literature constitutes the [[Agama (Hinduism)|Āgama]] texts of Vaishnavism.&lt;ref name="JonesRyan2006p321"/&gt; Like the Shaivism counterpart, it not only presents the theology, but describes the details, symbolism and procedures of Vaishnava temples building and rituals. According to the Pancharatra tradition, there are 108 ''[[samhita]]s'', but its texts list over 200 ''samhitas''.&lt;ref name="Dalal2010p293"/&gt; Many Pancaratra texts have been lost.

===List of agamas===
{{refimprove section|date=July 2017}}
The Pancharatra texts are samhitas and tantras which both classify as Agama due to subject matter. The Agamas are predominantly divided into Saiva, Sakta and Vaishnava Agamas. The Vaishnava Agamas identify Brahman as Vasudeva. The [[Mahabharata]] subscribes to the Pancharatra philosophy in its Narayaniya section. The Vaishnava Agamas are Pancharatra Agama and Vaikhanasa Agama. Some of the Samhita's are, a list mainly based on the list of the Sanskrit texts from the H.

A '''Peshwa''' was the equivalent of a modern [[Prime Minister]] in the [[Maratha Empire]].
Originally, the Peshwas served as subordinates to the [[Chhatrapati]] (the Maratha king), but later, they became the ''[[de facto]]'' leaders of the Marathas, and the Chatrapati was reduced to a nominal ruler.
During the last years of the Maratha Empire, the Peshwas themselves were reduced to titular leaders, and remained under the authority of the Maratha nobles and the [[British East India Company]].

All the Peshwas during the rule of Chhatrapati [[Shivaji]] and Chhatrapati [[Sambhaji]] belonged to [[Deshastha Brahmin]] community{{sfn|Prasad|2007|p=88}}{{full citation needed|date=July 2017}} The first Peshwa was [[Moropant Trimbak Pingle|Moropant Pingle]], who was appointed as the head of the [[Ashta Pradhan]] (council of eight ministers) by Chhatrapati [[Shivaji]], the founder of the Maratha Empire. The initial Peshwas were all ministers who served as the chief executives to the king. The later Peshwas held the highest administrative office and also controlled the Maratha confederacy. Under the [[Chitpavan Brahmin]] [[Bhat family]], the Peshwas became the ''de facto'' hereditary administrators of the Confederacy. The Peshwa's office was most powerful under [[Baji Rao I]] (r. 1720-1740). Under Peshwa administration and with the support of several key generals and diplomats, the Maratha Empire reached its zenith, ruling most of the [[Indian subcontinent]]. However, after the Peshwa [[Raghunathrao]] allied himself with the British, the Peshwa's power declined substantially. The subsequent Peshwas were titular leaders and are said to be responsible for the downfall of Maratha empire, due to inefficiency in handling the affairs of the state. Later on many provinces were controlled and administered either by the Maratha nobles such as [[Daulat Rao Sindhia]], or by the East India Company. During this period, the Maratha confederacy came to its end through its formal annexation into the [[British Empire]] in 1818.

[[File:Joppen1907India1795a.jpg|thumb|Extent of the [[Maratha Empire]], 1795]]
The word Peshwa is from [[Persian language|Persian]] {{lang|fa|پیشوا}} ''pēshwā'', meaning "foremost, leader".&lt;ref&gt;under Jahangir, M. Learning focus. Longman History &amp; Civics ICSE 7, 84.&lt;/ref&gt;
After the coronation of Shivaji in 1674, he appointed [[Moropant Peshwe|Moropant Trimbak Pingle]]{{Sfn|Kulkarni|1996|p=47}} as the first Peshwa. Shivaji renamed this designation as ''Pantpradhan'' in 1674 but this term was less commonly used. Moropant Trimbak Pingale's son, [[Moreshvar Pingale|Nilopant Moreshvar Pingale]], succeeded him during [[Sambhaji]]'s rule after Moropant's s death in 1683.{{Sfn|Joshi|1980|p=112}}

==Ramchandra Pant Amatya (Bawadekar)==

The third Peshwa, [[Ramchandra Pant Amatya|Ramchandra Amatya]] (né Ramachandra Nilkanth Pant), received royal status from [[Rajaram Chhatrapati|Chhatrapati Rajaram]] as "Hukumatpanha" from 1689 to 1699.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} He was a sound administrator who rose from the level of a local [[Kulkarni]] to the ranks of [[Ashta Pradhan]] due to guidance and support from Shivaji. ''Amatya'' is a [[Sanskrit]] term denoting counselor, guide, supervisor or overseer of both personal and governmental affairs.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

He recaptured many forts from the [[Mughals]] between 1690 and 1694, some in person, as well as personally conducting guerilla war techniques. When [[Rajaram Chhatrapati|Chhatrapati Rajaram]] fled to Jinji in 1689, before leaving from Maharashtra, he gave "Hukumat panha" (King Status) to Pant. Ramchandra Pant managed the entire state under many challenges such as the Mughal influx, the betrayal of Vatandars (Feudal Chiefs), and scarcity of food. With his help, Sachiv kept the Maratha State on a sound economic footing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Studies in Indian History: Historical Records at Goa|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=VLEo_DUL9XgC&amp;pg=PA42|publisher=Asian Educational Services|author=Surendranath Sen, Surendra Nath Sen|page=42|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pant got tremendous military help from [[Santaji Ghorpade]] and [[Dhanaji Jadhav]], the great Maratha Generals. Many times he directly participated in battles, especially during 1689–1695; he personally re-captured many forts in south Maharashtra from the Moghuls and played  the role of "Stand-in King" in the absence of Chhatrapati Rajaram.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

In 1698, he happily stepped down from the post of "Hukumatpanha" and Rajaram offered this post to his wife [[Tarabai]]. Tarabai gave an important position to Pant in the  administration of [[Maratha]] State. He wrote a book called ''[[Adnyapatra]]'' मराठी: आज्ञापत्र which explained different techniques of war, maintenance of forts and administration etc.

The concepts in ''Adnyapatra'' and the wisdom and leadership of Tarabai greatly helped the Maratha empire in building the foundation of state. As he was more loyal to Tarabai than Shahu, he was sidelined after the arrival of [[Chhatrapati Shahu]].  Later, the Peshwa post was given to Balaji Vishwanath in 1713. Ramchandra Pant died in 1716 at [[Panhala]] fort.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

==Parshuram Trimbak Kulkarni==

{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}

Parshuram Trimbak Kulkarni was born in a  Deshastha Brahmin family and held the post of Pantpratinidhi. Later on, he became the Jagirdar of [[Aundh State]] and [[Vishalgad]]. He was instrumental in holding the fort Panhala against Aurangzeb (1689). Though he lost the fort then, he recaptured it in 1692. He also captured territories between Miraj and fort Rangana and also Bhudargad, Chandangad, Pavangad, Satara and Vasantgad. He continued his loyalty towards Tarabai much to the chagrin of Shahu. Shahu imprisoned him twice between 1710-14. 14 (second time when his son Krishnaji joined the forces of Sammbhaji II).  But his life was spared by Shahu because of the intervention of Khando Ballal (Shahu's personal assistant) who reminded his king of Parshuram Trimbak's contribution to the Maratha cause. Parshuram Trimbak continued holding the position of Pant Pratinidhi in the time of Tarabai until his death in 1718. He was a devotee of Yamai Devi of Aundh and had composed poems praising her might. He was succeeded by his son Shrinivasrao, aka [[Shripatrao Pratinidhi|Shripatrao Pant Pratinidhi]], who continued albeit as the feudatory ruler of [[Aundh State]].

[[File:Bajirao Peshwa.jpg|thumb|right|H.H. Shrimant Bajirao Balaji (Ballal) Peshwa (aka Bajirao the First)]]
The Maratha  war of succession between Tara Bai and Shahu resulted in latter's victory and assumption    of Maratha throne as Chhatrapati.In 1713, Shahu appointed [[Balaji Vishwanath|Balaji Vishwanath (Bhat)]], as Peshwa.The  appointment of Balaji's son, [[Bajirao|Baji Rao I]], as Peshwa in 1719 by Shahu made the position hereditary in the Bhat family. Baji Rao proved his loyalty and patriotism by controlling the feudal chieftains who wanted independence from the Maratha Empire. The rebellion of General Trimbak Rao Dabhade, the ''[[senapati]]'' (commander in chief), over [[Chauth]]ai (revenue collection) of Gujarat is one example of such internal Maratha feuds. The followers of Baji and Trimbak clashed at the Battle of Bilhapur on April 1, 1731, and Trimbak was killed. In gratitude, Shahu gave the Peshwas and the Bhat family unchallenged control over Maratha empire.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'', Micropædia Vol. II, p17&lt;/ref&gt;  who also appointed Baji Rao's son as Peshwa in 1740, gave considerable authority to the Peshwas to command the Maratha armies, and they responded well during his reigns.

At the time of his death in 1749, Shahu made the Peshwas his successors under these conditions: Shivaji's descendants, who remained as the titular Raja of [[Satara State|Satara]], were called ''Swami'' ([[Marathi language|Marathi]] for the 'real owner') by the Peshwas who reported to them, and officially they were to seek guidance from the Raja. However, the Peshwa also became a ceremonial head of state after the battle of Panipat and the death of [[Madhavrao II Ballal|Madhavrao]].

==Legacy==
The first Peshwa to receive the status of a pantpradhan was Ramchandra Pant Amatya Bawdekar in 1689 by Chhatrapati Rajaram. The first (Bhat) Deshmukh family Peshwa was Balaji Vishwanath (Bhat) Deshmukh. He was succeeded as Peshwa by his son [[Baji Rao I]], who never lost a battle.

In Marathi.&lt;/ref&gt; Maratha expansion, brought to an end by the Marathas' defeat by an [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] army at the [[Third Battle of Panipat]] in 1761. The last Peshwa, [[Baji Rao II]], was defeated by the [[British East India Company]] in the [[Battle of Khadki]] which was a part of [[Third Anglo-Maratha War]] (1817–1818).  The Peshwa's land (Peshwai)  was annexed to the [[British East India Company]]'s [[Bombay state|Bombay province]], and the Bajirao II, the Peshwa was pensioned off.

| ''2nd Reign'' -  During his second reign began the [[Third Anglo-Maratha War]]. After the defeat at the [[Battle of Koregaon]] in January 1818, he was on the run from the British. Eventually, the British took over his dominion and made the Maratha King Pratap Singh of Satara declare in favour of the British. This ended the Peshwa's legal position as head of the [[Maratha confederacy]]. On 3 June 1818, Baji Rao surrendered to the British; he was banished to [[Bithur]] near [[Kanpur]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5449">'''Prison religion''' includes the [[religion|religious]] beliefs and practices of [[prison]] [[Wikt:Inmate|inmates]], usually stemming from or including concepts surrounding their imprisonment and accompanying lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://academic.scranton.edu/faculty/DAMMERH2/religion.html ''Religion in Prison''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070702212124/http://academic.scranton.edu/faculty/DAMMERH2/religion.html |date=2007-07-02 }}. Harry R. Dammer, University of Scranton&lt;/ref&gt; "Prison Ministry" is a larger concept, including the support of the spiritual and religious needs of prison guards and staff, whose work in an often demanding and brutal environment often creates a special need for pastoral care, similar to the care that is extended to the military, police officers and fire fighters.

==History==
[[File:Prison de Sainte-Pélagie - Chapelle.jpg|thumb|The chapel of the Saint-Pélagie Prison, Paris]]
Many religious groups often supply scripture and reading material, organize programs and worship, and train [[chaplains]] for work in prisons. Members of religious groups also engage in missionary activity, as there have been many instances of conversion throughout history.  For instance, one of the earliest introductions of [[Islam]] into [[Eastern Europe]] was through the work of an early 11th-century Muslim prisoner who was captured by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] during their war against Muslims.  The Muslim prisoner was brought into the territory of the [[Pechenegs]], where he taught and converted individuals to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=O45CAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=thomas+walker+arnold+preaching&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Vh74TLilEIOdlgfN34ifAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''The preaching of Islam: a history of the propagation of the Muslim faith''. Sir Thomas Walker Arnold, p. 335]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, early [[colonists]] originated the concept of the [[prison|penitentiary]] as a place where inmates would demonstrate their [[penance]] and remorse for their crimes through prayer and reflection.&lt;ref&gt;Clear, Todd R., Cole, George F., Reisig, Michael D. 2008. ''American Corrections''. Florence, KY: Cengage Learning.&lt;/ref&gt;

English prison chaplains also heard confessions from condemned prisoners, some of which were published – for example, the 18th century ''[[Ordinary of Newgate's Account]]''. Such accounts presented the prisoners as coming to terms with their guilt and preparing for salvation.

Chaplains have worked with prisoners and prison staff for many years, even before formal legislation addressed the constitutional rights of inmates.

A 2005 ''[[Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion]]'' study suggests that the practice of religion significantly reduces the chance of prisoners to engage in verbal or physical [[Wikt:altercation|altercations]], and increases the likelihood of reform after completing prison sentence time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070323195324/http://main.uab.edu/show.asp?durki=87547 ''UAB Study Finds Religion Helps Reduce Negative Prison Behaviors'']. Gail Short, UAB.edu, citing: Kent R. Kerley, Todd L. Matthews and Troy C. Blanchard. (2005) "Religiosity, Religious Participation, and Negative
Prison Behaviors." ''[[Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion]]''. 44(4):443–57&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasons for religious involvement==
[[File:Rabbi Philip Alstat.jpg|thumb|right|Rabbi Philip R. Alstat, c. 1920]]

Prisoners may become involved with religion while incarcerated for a variety of reasons ranging from the materially pragmatic to the personal and spiritual.  According to research conducted by sociologist Harry R. Dammer, some of the more prominent reasons include:
#Gaining direction and meaning in one's life.
#Improving one's concept of self.
#Promoting personal behavioral change.
#Gaining protection.
#Meeting other inmates.
#Meeting volunteers.
#Obtaining prison resources.&lt;ref&gt;Dammer, Harry R.  2006.  "Religion in prison."  In ''Encyclopedia of American Prisons'', edited by Marylin D. McShane and Frank P. Williams III.  New York: Garland Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dammer, Harry R. 1992. ''Piety in Prison''. Ann Arbor: University Microfilms.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, Rabbi [[Philip R. Alstat]], who served as Jewish chaplain for [[The Tombs]], the Manhattan Detention Facility, for thirty years, and also served as the Secretary of the National Jewish Council of Prison Chaplains, shared his vision of prison ministry by saying,  "My goals are the same as those of the prison authorities – to make better human beings. The only difference is that their means are discipline, security, and iron bars. Mine are the spiritual ministrations that operate with the mind and the heart."&lt;ref&gt;Edward Fiske, ''New York Times'', "City Prison Chaplains' Load is Heavy", Oct 26, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

This article examines the relationship between [[religion]] and [[poverty]] in the United States.  It analyzes the most and least religious states in the United States, potential reasons for high church attendance, the most poverty stricken states in the United States, potential factors of poverty, and religious institutions that are geared toward helping poverty.

== Religiosity in the United States ==
According to a poll done by [[Gallup (company)|Gallup]], the most religious states are those that are located in the "[[Bible Belt]]" and Utah.  The data is compiled based on weekly church attendance and people saying that they attend church "At least once a week." Based on their results, here is a [[List of U.S. states by religiosity|list]] of the most and least religious states in the United States is below.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Frequent Church Attendance Highest in Utah, Lowest in Vermont|url = http://www.gallup.com/poll/181601/frequent-church-attendance-highest-utah-lowest-vermont.aspx|website = Gallup.com|accessdate = 2015-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 3rd chart includes a map of the United States based on religiosity.

http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/churchattendance.jpg

=== Potential reasons for high [[Church attendance]] ===
Information based on a 2011 study done by Hartford Institute for Religion Research says that megachurches play a big role in church attendance.  As can be seen from the chart below, the major areas in the United States with megachurches are the south and the far west.  It is important to note that some of the areas with the most percentages of megachurches are actually in the bottom states for weekly church attendance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 2011 Summary Research Report of A New Decade of Megachurches|url = http://www.hartfordinstitute.org/megachurch/megachurch-2011-summary-report.htm|website = www.hartfordinstitute.org|accessdate = 2015-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

http://www.hartfordinstitute.org/images/2011c.jpg

== Most poverty stricken states in the United States ==
Here is a [[list of U.S. states by poverty rate]], ranking from 1st to 50th. A study done by economists from Harvard and UC Berkeley claims that religious communities provide a source of [[social capital]]. It continues on to say that this social capital is likely to affect income inequality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Religion and Income Inequality: The Paradox of the South|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/julie-j-park/religion-and-income-inequ_b_3659949.html|website = The Huffington Post|accessdate = 2015-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; One theory, presented by Dr. Tom Rees through an independent study conducted by himself, is that personal insecurities, or the lack of being secure, correlates directly with religiosity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Research shows link between poverty gap and religious belief|url = https://humanism.org.uk/2009/07/29/news-332/|website = British Humanist Association|accessdate = 2015-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also suggests that in these poverty stricken areas, churches are popular places to go to get help with basic needs such as food or clothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Why Are the Poor More Religious? - TheHumanist.com|url = http://thehumanist.com/news/national/why-are-the-poor-more-religious|website = TheHumanist.com|accessdate = 2015-12-17|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Potential Factors of Poverty ==
According to [[Princeton University]], poverty is unique because it started to decrease around the 60's and 70's, but since then has had an uneven pattern of growth.  A few factors that they mention that contribute to poverty are the economy, changes in family composition, and changes in [[government spending]].  From these factors, they mention some sub-factors such as wage inequality, unemployment, single parent households, and government programs such as Social Security, Medicare, and other groups that compensate for unemployment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = - The Future of Children -|url = https://www.princeton.edu/futureofchildren/publications/journals/article/index.xml?journalid=33&amp;articleid=64&amp;sectionid=323|website = www.princeton.edu|accessdate = 2015-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allan G. Johnson, author of "The Forest and the Trees" claims that one potential factor is our system of wealth. He argues that our system allows too much power for the elite to be successful and leaves the rest of the population to share what little amount of wealth is left.  He uses a game of musical chairs as an analogy:  "Since the game is set up with fewer chairs than there are people, someone has to wind up without a place to sit when the music stops."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Why Is There Poverty?|url = http://www.agjohnson.us/essays/poverty/|website = Allan G. Johnson|accessdate = 2015-12-17|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religious Institutions Helping Poverty ==
There are certain religious organizations that claim to help with poverty.  Some deal specifically with national poverty here in the United States, and others deal with international poverty all over the globe.  According to [[TakePart]], some of the top non-profit organizations helping fight poverty today are: [[Feeding America]], [[Kiva (organization)|KIVA]], [[ONE Campaign|ONE]], [[Oxfam]], [[Jubilee USA Network|Jubilee USA]], [[Mercy Corps]], and [[The Hunger Project]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Top 10 Non-Profits Fighting Poverty|url = http://www.takepart.com/article/2009/02/17/top-10-non-profits-fighting-poverty|website = TakePart|accessdate = 2015-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

According to historians, The Sathwara are descended from a Rajput (Kshatriya) who took a Kurmi (Kunbi) wife and then left North India for Gujarat/Saurashtra. Their own origin mythology refers to a belief that they were Rajput-Kshatriya, who escaped the wrath of the Hindu god [[Parashurama|Parshurama]] by abandoning the [[Kshatriya]] custom of being warriors and took to farming. They are found mainly in north [[Gujarat]], [[Saurashtra_(region)|Saurashtra]] and [[Kutch]]. They speak [[Gujarati_language|Gujarati]] and [[Kutchi language|Kutchi]].&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1273"&gt;People of India Gujarat Volume XXI Part Three edited by R.B Lal, P.B.S.V Padmanabham, G Krishnan &amp; M Azeez Mohideen pages 1273-1277&lt;/ref&gt;

The sathwara mostly live in Gujarat especially in [[Ahmedabad,_Gujarat|Ahmedabad]], [[Anand,_Gujarat|Anand]], [[Patan_district|Patan]], [[Mehsana_district|Mehsana]], Surendranagar, [[Jamnagar]], Vadhiyar, [[Junagadh]], Morbi, [[Bhavnagar]], and [[Sabarkantha_district|Sabarkantha]].

The different castes of this [[Society|samaj]] are Sathwara, Satvara, Kanjariya, Hadiyal, Rathod, Bumtariya, Sonagra, Kadia, Nakum, Khandhara, Khant, Chauhan, Parmar, Solanki and so on...

According to historians the sathwaras were formerly farmers.

== Present circumstances ==

The Sathwara are found mainly in the districts of [[Ahmedabad,_Gujarat|Ahmedabad]], [[Patan_district|Patan]], [[Mehsana_district|Mehsana]], [[Dwarka|Dwaraka]], [[Botad_district|Botad]], [[Anand district|Anand]], [[Jamnagar]], [[Rajkot]], [[Bhavnagar]], [[Surendranagar district|Surendranagar]], [[Junagadh]], and [[Morbi]]. The north Gujarat Sathwara are further divided into territorial divisions, the Dandariya group found in [[Sabarkantha]] and Patanwadia and Dandhavya found in [[Mehsana District]]. They are further divided into exogamous clans, the main ones being the Khandara, hadiyal, Kanjariya, Sonagra, Nakum, Kateshiya, Katechia, Kacchatiya, Chopda, Maghodiya, Chauhan, Jambukia, Chavada, Parmar, Bedia, Mori, Makwana, vaid and Dabhi. They are constituents of the ther-tasidi group of [[Hindu]] [[castes]], that interdine.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1273"/&gt;

Today, Sathwara name is across India, as well as several other countries. There are roughly more than 500,000 Sathwara’s outside India, including 150,000 in Britain and 150,000 in the US and Canada.

The Sathwaras are widely spread in many numbers found in [[Gujarat]], and have follow almost similar customs. Traditionally, they were Kshatriya and were engaged in many diverse occupations such as Masonry Art, Stone Carving, and Farming. However, the majority of the community remain Farmers. 

At present Sathwaras are also associated/engaged in many modern occupations not limited to Large/Small Businesses, Construction Businesses, Manufacturing Industries, Machining Industries, Architectures, Decorators, Gold Smiths etc... many of them are gaining higher education and working in Government, Semi Government and private sectors.

==Other names of Sathwara community==

They are known by names of ''Sathwara, Sathvara, Satvara, Satwara, Kutchi Satvara, Kadia Sathwara or Kadia Sathvara, Dalwadi and Satwara Salat''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Yadav| first = Neelam| title = Encyclopaedia Of Backward Castes| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=FchrfQ-BCVMC&amp;pg=PA316| year = 2005| publisher = Anmol Publications Pvt.

[[File:Scientology_symbol.svg|thumb|150px|The eight-pointed [[Scientology cross]]]]

[[Scientology]] is suspected or alleged by some observers of being inspired by, or sharing elements with, a number of esoteric or occult systems. 

Scientology founder [[L. Ron Hubbard]] claimed to have had a near-death experience in 1938 that inspired him to write ''[[Excalibur (L. Ron Hubbard)|Excalibur]]'', an unpublished manuscript based on the revelations from the experience. In 1945–46, Hubbard was briefly involved with and defrauded&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;{{cite book |title=Bare-faced Messiah: The True Story of L. Ron Hubbard |edition=third |last=Miller | first=Russell  |year=2014 |publisher=Silvertail Books |location=London, England |isbn= 978-1-909269-14-9 | pages=127–130}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jack Parsons (rocket engineer)|Jack Parsons]], an American rocketry pioneer who was also a devoted [[Thelema|Thelemite]] and member of the [[Agape Lodge]] of [[Aleister Crowley]]'s [[magical order]], [[Ordo Templi Orientis]], in [[Pasadena, California]].&lt;ref name="Hugh B 2012"/&gt;  In 1950, Hubbard published ''[[Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health]]'', and in 1953 he organized the [[Church of Scientology]].

The [[occult]] (from the [[Latin]] word ''occultus'' "clandestine, hidden, secret") is "knowledge of the hidden".&lt;ref&gt;[[George Crabb (writer)|Crabb, G.]] (1927). ''English synonyms explained, in alphabetical order, copious illustrations and examples drawn from the best writers''. New York: Thomas Y. Crowell Co.&lt;/ref&gt; In common [[English language|English]] usage, ''occult'' refers to "knowledge of the [[paranormal]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Evelyn Underhill|Underhill, E.]] (1911). ''Mysticism'', Meridian, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;  It also describes a number of [[magical organization]]s or orders.

[[Hugh B. Urban]], a scholar on religion who has written much about Scientology, writes that while some writers, such as [[Jon Atack]], assert that Crowley's ideas on magic are at the core of Scientology, others, including [[Roy Wallis]] and [[J. Gordon Melton]], have dismissed the connection between occultism and the Church. He argues further that the occult elements are combined with concepts in Eastern religions, [[science fiction]], [[pop psychology]] and Hubbard's own thoughts, while confirming that there is one element that is related to the occult in the religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Occult Roots of Scientology?

==Hubbard's early interest in the occult==
Hubbard's eldest son, [[Ronald DeWolf]], related a story that L. Ron Hubbard had "first discovered Magick" at the age of sixteen when he read Aleister Crowley's [[The Book of the Law]].{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} Author Jon Atack reports that Hubbard joined the [[Rosicrucian]] order [[Ancient and Mystical Order Rosae Crucis]] (AMORC) in 1940, completing the first two neophyte degrees.  According to Atack, Hubbard's membership lapsed on July 5, 1940.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spaink.net/cos/essays/atack_occult.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.american-buddha.com/cult.pieceofbluesky.2.3.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Near-death experience and ''Excalibur''==
{{see also|Excalibur (L. Ron Hubbard)}}
In April 1938, Hubbard reportedly had a bad reaction to a drug during a dental procedure. According to his account, this caused a [[near-death experience]].  Allegedly inspired by this experience, Hubbard composed a manuscript, which was never published, with working titles of "The One Command" or ''Excalibur''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.npr.org/2013/01/24/170010096/going-clear-a-new-book-delves-into-scientology&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lermanet.com/excalibur/&lt;/ref&gt;  The contents of ''Excalibur'' formed the basis for some of his later publications.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, "The Anatomy Of Thought". Hubbard Communication Office Policy Letter 26 April 1970R, revised 15 March 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arthur J. Burks]], who read the work in 1938, later recalled it discussed the "one command": to survive, a theme that Hubbard revisited in ''Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health''.  Burks also recalled that the work discussed the psychology of a lynch mob.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.american-buddha.com/cult.yesbookcalledexcalibur.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  Hubbard cited ''Excalibur'' as an early version of ''Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health''.&lt;ref name="tonyortega.org"&gt;http://tonyortega.org/2014/10/23/l-ron-hubbard-explains-to-a-friend-the-real-reason-he-wrote-dianetics/&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- In 1948, Hubbard gave a talk mentioning "having been dead for eight minutes".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lermanet.com/excalibur/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arthur J. Burks  "The Aberee", Dec 1961 (  http://www.xenu.net/archive/oca/burks.html&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

==Aleister Crowley's magical order==

{{main article|L. Ron Hubbard#Occult involvement in Pasadena|Babalon Working}}

In August 1945 Hubbard moved into the [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]] mansion of [[Jack Parsons (rocket propulsion engineer)|John "Jack" Whiteside Parsons]], an avid [[occultism|occultist]] and [[Thelema|Thelemite]], follower of the English ceremonial magician [[Aleister Crowley]] and leader of a lodge of Crowley's [[magical order]], [[Ordo Templi Orientis]] (OTO).&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books/about/Going_Clear.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller-113"&gt;Miller, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; Parsons and Hubbard collaborated on the "[[Babalon Working]]", a [[sex magic]] ritual intended to summon an incarnation of [[Babalon]], the supreme Thelemite Goddess.&lt;ref name="Urban"&gt;Urban, Hugh B. ''Magia sexualis: sex, magic, and liberation in modern Western esotericism'', p. 137. Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 2006. {{ISBN|978-0-520-24776-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' published an exposé detailing Hubbard's experiences with Parsons and the OTO.&lt;ref&gt;http://tonyortega.org/2013/09/28/10468/  http://www.lermanet.com/scientologynews/crowley-hubbard-666.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hubbard's experience with hypnosis==
{{main article|Scientology and hypnosis}}
Hubbard was known to his associates in the late 1940s as a talented [[Hypnosis|hypnotist]].&lt;ref name="secretlives"&gt;{{cite episode|
title=L. Ron Hubbard|
series=Secret Lives|
credits=Robinson, Jill|
network=A&amp;E|airdate=1997-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, he worked in Hollywood posing as a [[swami]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite speech|
first=L. Ron|last=Hubbard|
title=The Story of Dianetics and Scientology, Lecture 18|date=October 1958}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Church says that Hubbard's experience with hypnosis led to his discovery of the principles of [[Dianetics]] as a technique for solving man's problems.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, ''What is Scientology?'', 1998 softcover edition, pg. 529.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Affirmations==
{{main article|Affirmations (L. Ron Hubbard)}}
The "Affirmations" is a document purportedly written by Hubbard in the late 1940s, a few years before he established [[Dianetics]] (1950) or [[Scientology]] (1952). The Affirmations appear to have been intended to be used as a form of self-hypnosis.

Many suggestions encourage Hubbard to believe in his own occult powers: 
* "That I believe in my gods and spiritual things."
* "That my magical work is powerful and effective."
* "You are psychic."

Several suggestions reference a [[Tutelary deity|guardian spirit]]:
* "You can do [[automatic writing]] whenever you wish. You do not care what comes out on the paper when your Guardian dictates."&lt;ref name="Wright53-4"&gt;Wright, p. 53-4&lt;/ref&gt; 
* "Nothing can intervene between you and your Guardian. She cannot be displaced because she is too powerful. She does not control you. She advises you."
* "The most thrilling thing in your life is your love and consciousness of your Guardian."
* "You can talk with her and audibly hear her voice above all others."

Another suggestion involves numerology: "That the numbers 7, 25 and 16 are not unlucky or evil for me."

Scholars have noted that the Affirmations contain themes that reappeared later in Scientology.&lt;ref name="Urban" /&gt; One Affirmation  foreshadows Hubbard's future interest in mental healing: "You understand all the workings of the minds of humans around you, for you are a doctor of minds, bodies and influences."&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=liDmBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT33&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Lawrence Wright]] suggests  "Hubbard is using techniques on himself that he would later develop into Dianetics." He draws parallels with the practice of "[[Auditing (Scientology)|auditing]]" used in Dianetics and Scientology, noting that the Affimations and Dianetics both involve tackling difficult memories that hold back mental and spiritual progress.

The Affirmations became public knowledge in during the 1984 [[Church of Scientology of California v. Armstrong|lawsuit against Hubbard's former archivist]].  In that settlement, Armstrong was required to return "all originals and copies of the documents commonly known as the 'Affirmations' written by L. Ron Hubbard". As religious studies scholar Hugh Urban comments, "here the church clearly indicates that the text was ''written by L. Ron Hubbard'', and it seems difficult to understand why the church would file suit to retain ownership of the text were it not an authentic document."&lt;ref name="Urban"&gt;Urban, pp. 345–6&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dianetics==
[[File:L. Ron Hubbard conducting Dianetics seminar in Los Angeles in 1950.jpg|thumb|400px|Hubbard conducting a Dianetics seminar in Los Angeles in 1950]]
In a 1949 letter to [[Forrest Ackerman]], Hubbard promises his upcoming work will give Ackerman the power to "rape women without their knowing it, communicate suicide messages to your enemies as they sleep, sell the [[Arroyo Seco Parkway]] to the mayor for cash, evolve the best way of protecting or destroying communism".&lt;ref name="tonyortega.org"/&gt;  Hubbard admits he has "not decided whether to destroy the Catholic church or merely start a new one."&lt;ref name="tonyortega.org"/&gt;

In 1950, Hubbard published an article entitled "[[Dianetics: the Evolution of a Science]]" in the magazine [[Amazing Stories]].    In that article, Hubbard discusses the use of hypnosis, automatic writing, automatic speaking and clairvoyance.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.matrixfiles.com/Scientology%20Materials/Books/EOS.PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

Author Jon Atack has noted Hubbard seems to have a special interest in the Roman goddess 'Diana'.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=za9BM0BvmkMC&amp;pg=PA364&lt;/ref&gt; In 1946, using money from Jack Parsons, Hubbard purchased a boat named "Diane".&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=za9BM0BvmkMC&amp;pg=PA364&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spaink.net/cos/essays/atack_occult.html&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1952, Hubbard named his daughter Diana.  Later, Hubbard named a sea org vessel 'Diana'.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=za9BM0BvmkMC&amp;pg=PA364&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spaink.net/cos/essays/atack_occult.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Atack speculates "Dianetics" might be a 'double-entendre', and notes the existence of the earlier occult practice of [[Dianism]].&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=za9BM0BvmkMC&amp;pg=PA364&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spaink.net/cos/essays/atack_occult.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philadelphia Doctorate Course==
In December 1952, Hubbard recorded a series of audio lectures in which he connects Crowleyite magical rituals and the practice of Scientology.&lt;ref&gt;Urban, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard explains the use of [[Tarot]],&lt;ref&gt;http://tonyortega.org/2013/09/28/10468/&lt;/ref&gt; and discusses "the magic cults" of the 8th-12th centuries. He recommends [[Magick in Theory and Practice|The Master Therion]] as "the only modern work that has anything to do with them".  He describes the book's author, Aleister Crowley, as "my very good friend," though there is some question about his intent in this remark because Hubbard never met Crowley personally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Melton|first1=J. Gordon|title=Studies in Contemporary Religion: The Church of Scientology|date=2000|publisher=Signature Books|location=United States|isbn=978-1-56085-139-4|page=67|edition=1|url=http://signaturebooks.com/2010/12/excerpt-the-church-of-scientology/|accessdate=15 May 2015|quote= In an off-the-cuff remark during the Philadelphia Lectures in 1952 (PDC Lecture 18), Hubbard referred to “my friend Aleister Crowley.” This reference would have to be one of literary allusion, as Crowley and Hubbard never met. He obviously had read some of Crowley’s writings and makes reference to one of the more famous passages in Crowley’s vast writings and his idea that the essence of the magical act was the intention with which it was accomplished. Crowley went on to illustrate magic with a mundane example, an author’s intention in writing a book.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hubbard also explains that Crowley "signs himself "The Beast"; "The Mark of the Beast, 666."" &lt;ref name="xenu.net"&gt;http://www.xenu.net/archive/books/mom/Messiah_or_Madman.txt&lt;/ref&gt;

In The Book of the Law, Crowley wrote "The whole and sole object of all true magickal training is to become free from every kind of limitation."   Hubbard repurposed this for his movement, lecturing that "Our whole activity tends to make an individual completely independent of any type of limitation.... Old Aleister Crowley had some interesting things to say about this. He wrote the ''Book of the Law''."&lt;ref name="xenu.net"/&gt;  Ronald DeWolf, Hubbard's eldest son, wrote that "In preparation for the next day's lecture, [Hubbard]'d pace the floor, exhilarated by this or that passage from Aleister Crowley's writings."&lt;ref name="cs.cmu.edu"&gt;http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Library/Shelf/wakefield/christians.html&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Philadelphia course, Hubbard jokes that he is "the prince of darkness", which is met with laughter from the audience.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=TExVDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT108&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lermanet.com/books/messiah-or-madman.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Heidi Forrester" sex incident==
According to a former member of the Sea Organization pseudonymously named "Heidi Forrester", in late 1975 she met with "a heavy-set older man. He had reddish grey hair, slightly long in the back. He was wearing a white shirt, black pants, black tie, and black shoes, highly polished." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.xenu.net/archive/books/mom/Messiah_or_Madman.txt&lt;/ref&gt;

She recalls "He lay on top of me.  As far as I can tell he had no erection. However, using his hand in some way he managed to get his penis inside me. [...]   Then for the next hour he did absolutely nothing at all. I mean nothing!"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.xenu.net/archive/books/mom/Messiah_or_Madman.txt&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Original" OT8==
{{see also|OT VIII|Jesus in Scientology}}
[[Operating Thetan]] level VIII is highest level of auditing level in Scientology.  It is known as "The Truth Revealed".  It was initially released to select high-ranking public Scientologists in 1988.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;http://tonyortega.org/2014/06/24/up-the-bridge-we-finally-reach-ot-8-but-was-its-first-version-really-a-hoax/&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In OT VIII, dated 1980, Hubbard explains the document is intended for circulation only after his death.  Its purpose is to explain the untold story of Hubbard's life's work.&lt;ref&gt;"By the time you read this I will no longer be occupying the body and identity that you have known as Ron."&lt;/ref&gt;  Hubbard explains that the reader has "undoubtedly heard pieces of data over the years that hinted at the greater untold reality of my mission here on Earth" but "the story was never written, nor spoken...  It  is only now that I feel it safe to release the information".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Fishman/Declaration/ot8b.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubbard mentions the [[Book of Revelation]] and its prophecy of a time when "an arch-enemy of Christ, referred to as the anti-Christ, will reign".   According to Hubbard, the "anti-Christ represents the forces of Lucifer".   Hubbard writes "My mission could be said to fulfill the Biblical promise represented by this brief anti-Christ period."&lt;ref name="cs.cmu.edu"/&gt;

In the document, Hubbard also teaches that "the historic Jesus was not nearly the sainted figure [he] has been made out to be.  In addition to being a lover of young boys and men. he was given to uncontrollable bursts of temper and hatred".&lt;ref&gt;http://tonyortega.org/2014/06/24/up-the-bridge-we-finally-reach-ot-8-but-was-its-first-version-really-a-hoax&lt;/ref&gt;

===Authenticity===
The document was posted to the Internet in 1995 as part of the [[Fishman Affidavit|Fishman papers]].  The [[Church of Scientology]] denies the document's authenticity, though notable defectors have described receiving the document as part of their training for the rank of OT8.

George White, a public scientologist who had received OT8 in the summer of 1988, asserts the document is authentic.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://tonyortega.org/2015/02/06/scientology-vs-the-mayor-the-full-gabe-cazares-interview-from-1997s-secret-lives/&lt;/ref&gt;  Frank Oliver, a former operative with Scientology's [[Office of Special Affairs]], reports having discovered the document in the church's archives.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;   Jesse Prince, former second-in-command of Scientology's [[Religious Technology Center]], reports that OTVIII was revised after early participants were "horribly upset" by the content.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.xenu-directory.net/news/images/1998-interviews-prince.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
[[Ronald DeWolf|Lafayette Ronald Hubbard, Jr.]],  Hubbard's eldest son, had been an active participant in the early days of Scientology.  In 1959, he left Scientology and later took the name Ronald DeWolf.

In the mid-1980s, DeWolf gave a series of sworn statements and interviews detailing his father's history.   DeWolf explained his father had been "deeply involved in the occult and black-magic."  According to DeWolf, Aleister Crowley's death in 1947 was a pivotal event that led Hubbard to "take over the mantle of the Beast".  DeWolf claimed that "Black magic is the inner core of Scientology", arguing that "my father did not worship Satan. He thought he was Satan."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lermanet.com/scientologynews/penthouse-LRonHubbardJr-interview-1983.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, [[Jamie DeWolf]] (Ronald's grandson) announced the discovery of Ronald DeWolf's unpublished memoir which had been written in 1981.  That work discusses the Hubbards' history of occult practices.&lt;ref&gt;http://tonyortega.org/2014/05/10/jamie-dewolf-ive-found-the-last-memoir-of-the-son-of-scientologys-founder/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Jesus, Scientology and the occult==
Those in the occult legitimize their worldview “by claiming Jesus taught theories similar to theirs – accepting the illusion of a historical Jesus even as they alter Him to fit their theory or perceptions.” According to ''The Kingdom of the Occult'' Scientologists arbitrarily claim that “Jesus was a member of the cult of the Essenes, who believed in reincarnation,” to give credence to their belief in reincarnation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Martin |first1=Walter |last2=Rische |first2=Jill Martin |last3=Kurt |first3=Van Gorden |title=The Kingdom of the Occult |editor-last=Lewis |editor-first=James R. |publisher=Harper Collins |year=2008 |isbn=0-19-514986-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shakatapuram''' is a religious place for [[Hindu]]s located in the [[Koppa, India|Koppa]] taluk of the state of [[Karnataka]], India.&lt;ref name="cite1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/fr/2002/01/11/stories/2002011101280900.htm|work=Online Edition of The Hindu, dated 2002-01-11|title= Celebration at Sakatapuram|accessdate=2007-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is located near [[Sringeri]] and is situated on the banks of river [[Tunga River|Tunga]]. It is famous for a [[Matha|Hindu Math]] called ''Shri Vidya Peetam'' which is present at this place. Shakatapuram is also known by the name '''[[Bhandigadi]]'''. The Kumbhabhishekam event held at this place attracts a number of devotees.

== History ==
The history of the ''Shri Vidya Peetam'' can be traced to a [[sadhu]] named ''[[Totakacharya|Thotakacharya]]'', who was a disciple of [[Adi Shankara]] and the first [[pontiff]] of the ''[[Jyotirmath|Uttaramnaya Jyotish Peetam]]'', a Hindu institution, located in [[Badrinath]].&lt;ref name="cite1"/&gt; A sadhu named ''Sri Satya Theertha'' who was of the same [[lineage (anthropology)|lineage]] as Thotakacharya, came to Shakatapuram about six centuries ago and established the ''Shri Vidya Peetam''.&lt;ref name="cite1"/&gt; An idol of the Hindu God, [[Narayana|Lakshmi Narayana]] was brought by ''Sri Satya Teertha'' from Badarinath and installed at Shakatapuram. This is the presiding deity of this place. The Hindu Gods, [[Krishna]], [[Shakti|Raja Rajeshwari]] and [[Dattatreya]] are also worshipped here. The Math preaches the [[Advaita]] form of [[Hindu philosophy]].

== Current scenario ==
The current pontiff of the Math is ''Sri Sri Sri Krishnananda Theertha Mahaswamigal'' who is the 33rd pontif to head this institution. He is a scholar in [[Kannada]], [[Sanskrit]] and [[Vedanta]] and he became the head of this institution at the age of 13.&lt;ref name="indexp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/res/web/pIe/ie/daily/19990118/01851715.html|work=Online Edition of The Indian Express, dated 1999-01-18|title= Spreading the message of goodwill|accessdate=2007-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; He started touring India in 1994, to spread his message of goodwill and spirituality amongst the people.&lt;ref name="indexp"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1997">'''Shentu''' ({{zh|神荼}}) or '''Shenshu''' is one of the two door gods in [[Chinese mythology]] known as [[Menshen]]. It can found in an early text from ''Shanghaijing''. The gods were later incorporated into [[Taoism]].&lt;ref name="YangAn2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lihui Yang|author2=Deming An|author3=Jessica Anderson Turner|title=Handbook of Chinese Mythology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gGD5go6iCUYC&amp;pg=PA200|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-533263-6|pages=200–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The earliest mention of Shentu is from the [[Zhou Dynasty]] (1046 BC–256 BC). The other deity is Yulü. The two gods are responsible for supervising all spirits and stayed above the gate. Evil and harmful spirits were tied up and fed to tigers. The gods were believed to protect people from disasters, protect "fortunes and dispell evil influences".&lt;ref name="chin_Meet"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Meet the Gods of Chinese New Year| last = Beck | first = Stewart Lee| work = China Simplified| date = 26 January 2017| accessdate = 2018-03-13| url = http://www.chinasimplified.com/2017/01/26/meet-gods-chinese-new-year/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest reference to the gods can be found in Classic Liji 禮記 "Book of Rites".&lt;ref name="chin_Mens"/&gt;

The story of [[Zhong Kui]], the ghost fighter, which emerged during the [[Tang Dynasty]] was believed to help guard the gates as well.&lt;ref name="chin_Mens"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Menshen 門神, the Door Gods| work = chinaknowledge.de| accessdate = 2018-03-13| url = http://www.chinaknowledge.de/Literature/Religion/personsmenshen.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Qing Dynasty]], there was doubt of two door gods. Chinese scholar [[Yu Zhengxie]] believed there was only one god name Yulei (郁垒) or Tulei (荼垒).&lt;ref name="chin_Mens"/&gt;

== Udupi cuisine ==
{{Main|Udupi cuisine}}
Shivalli Brahmins are famous for ''Udupi hotels'' (vegetarian restaurants) known for serving typical south Indian dishes like [[idli]], [[vada (food)|vada]], [[dosa]], shira and [[upma]] etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/mp/2005/01/05/stories/2005010500150300.htm |title = Utterly Udipi |accessdate= 2009-09-23 |publisher=thehinduonnet.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shivalli Brahmins have a unique style of cooking, serving and eating meals. The meal is served on a plantain (banana) leaf and is usually eaten by hand, seated with padmasana like position on the floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?210644|title=Udupi food holy food |accessdate=2010-02-01 |publisher=outlookindia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; As per traditions male members must be bare chested while eating meal and must not talk except for deveranama (bhajan). While having meals, all Brahmins including women and children must start and end their meal together. No one should get up during the meals. The meal is wholesome and elaborate in preparation, serving and eating.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

== Rituals and customs ==

=== Rituals ===
[[File:Upanayanam.jpg|thumb|left|A young Shivalli Brahmin boy during his [[upanayana]]]]

Shivalli Brahmin males undergo the [[Upanayana]] when they turn seven years old to initiate them into Vedic studies.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.mapsofindia.com/mangalore/people-culture-festivals/shivalli.html Upanayana Ceremony]".&lt;/ref&gt; It is also known as Brahmopadesham. The key ritual during the Upanayana is that of putting a [[sacred thread]] consisting of three cotton strands across the left shoulder of the boy. The initiate is called a ''[[dvija]]'' "twice-born" and is expected to perform the [[sandhyavandanam]] at least twice daily. Dvija has a special knot in it which is called as "Brahma Gantu". Shivalli Madhwa Brahmins also undergo the [[Upakarma]], where the sacred thread is changed and mudradharana is done. Mudradharana is a ritual where Vaishnavite [[mudra|symbols]] like the [[conch]] or the wheel are etched on bodies as a ritual of purification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/bengaluru/upper-caste-families-look-other-communities-945 |title=Upper castes families look to other communities |accessdate=2010-02-01 |publisher=deccanchronicle.com |dead-url=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160114022217/http://www.deccanchronicle.com/bengaluru/upper-caste-families-look-other-communities-945 |archivedate=2016-01-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the prevalent practice is to paint the symbols using gopichandana paste. In old vedas it is mentioned that after upanayana he enters the stage of Brahmacharya ashram, leading a celibate and austere life of a student in his teacher’s home, eating from handouts given by the generous neighbors. It is equivalent to say he will undergo studies excluding all other aspects in modern days.
When he has accomplished his studies of the Vedas, he enters the Grahastha ashram, a married man becoming head of his household. This dvija also called as "Janivara" is replaced with six cotton strands during the wedding.

In Tulunadu (consisting of present Udupi, Dakshina Kannada and Kasargodu districts). Every Shivalli Madhva Brahmin household has its own Bhoota and Nagadevata. These deities were worshiped by household members. Today because of so-called modernisation and emigration they are followed in some households only.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

=== Marriage ===
Present day marriages of Shivalli Madhva Brahmins are a four-day ceremony, sometimes condensed to a single day due to the fast pace of today's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-03-29/mysore/28013336_1_heritage-city-mysore-dakshina-kannada-district |title =They-sell-food-spread-hospitality |accessdate= 2010-02-02 |publisher=timesofindia.indiatimes.com |first1=Lawrence |last1=Milton |date=2009-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the three-day ritual, the process of marriage starts with ''Naandi'' (literally meaning ''start''). During Naandi, which takes place in the groom's and bride's homes separately, but at the same time, a ceremony is performed where the bride and groom have coconut oil and turmeric applied to them and are bathed in hot water followed by other rituals. Marriage (''Madimae'' in Tulu) takes place at a temple, hall or auditorium followed by lunch. All the ceremonies are held as per [[horoscopes]] of bride and groom at a particular time called [[muhurtha]]. Generally the day after marriage, a ceremony called as the ''Bigara authana'' (a sort of reception) is held at the groom's place and consists of the ''[[Satyanarayana puja]]'' and other rituals followed by lunch. The bigara authana is an equivalent of the marriage reception. Fourth day is small function at the bride's house named as "Aarthakshathe." It is a ritual where shamiana (house decorative) will be removed concluding end of the ceremony. Bride and groom's Basinga (a wearing specially worn on wedding day) is tied to a pole in the bride's house and the newly married couple will start their new life with elders' (hiriyer) blessings.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

== Festivals ==
Shivalli Brahmins celebrate all major Hindu festivals such as [[Ganesh Chaturthi]], [[Deepavali]], [[Navaratri]], [[Sankranti]], Madhwanavami, [[Janmashtami]], [[maha shivaratri]], Bisu Parba(Tulu New Year), Ramanavami, Hanuman Jayanthi etc. They also believe in [[nagaradhane]] and rituals of [[Bhuta Kola]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://shivallibrahmins.com/english/holy-days/holy-days-of-this-year/ |title =holy days |accessdate= 2010-01-07 |publisher= shivallibrahmins.com}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

[[Sikhism]] can be found predominantly in the [[Punjab region]] of [[India]] but [[Sikh]] communities exist on every inhabited continent, with the largest emigrant population being in [[Canada]] and [[United Kingdom]]. In the early 21st century there were nearly 25 million Sikhs worldwide, the great majority of them living in the Indian state of Punjab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Sikhism |title=Sikhism |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |access-date=7 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The larger round hole in the floor is a fire pit. Observe that the air intake (little rectangular door in the wall), the stones that block air from the air intake, the fire pit and the sipapu are all in a line; this aspect of the design was intentional.

'''''Sipapu''''' is a [[Hopi language|Hopi]] word for a small hole or indentation in the floor of a ''[[kiva]]'' or pithouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://google.com/|title=Google|website=google.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kivas were used by the [[Ancestral Puebloans]] and continue to be used by modern-day [[Pueblo people|Puebloans]]. The ''sipapu'' symbolizes the portal through which their ancient ancestors [[Hopi mythology#Four Worlds|first emerged]] to enter the present world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wenger |first=Gilbert R. |title=The Story of Mesa Verde National Park |publisher=Mesa Verde Museum Association |location=[[Mesa Verde National Park]], Colorado |year=1991 |orig-year=1980 |isbn=0-937062-15-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, The Hopi Sacred Stories explain that this is the hole in which the first peoples of this world entered.  As "They" stepped outside of the "Sipapu", they changed from lizard-like beings into homo sapiens, or human form (See Waters, 1963, and later reprints; Courlander, 1971). It is from this point that the "First Peoples" of the Earth began to divide and separate, creating differing tribes along the first journeys of the first humans.

The Hopi and other Pueblo Culture people (Zuni, Acoma) believe that they are born of the Grand Canyon which is where the original Sipapu is located.  The Grand Canyon is the 'place of emergence' and each modern Hopi village would have one or several kivas.  Each kiva is subterranean and contains a small hole, just off center, to represent their place of emergence for religious purpose.</text>

The '''Southeastern Ceremonial Complex''' (formerly the '''Southern Cult'''), aka '''S.E.C.C.''', is the name given to the regional stylistic similarity of [[artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]], [[iconography]], [[ceremony|ceremonies]], and [[mythology]] of the [[Mississippian culture]] that coincided with their adoption of [[maize]] agriculture and [[chiefdom]]-level complex social organization from 1200 to 1650 CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siu.edu/~anthro/muller/SECC/sld008.htm |title=Connections |author=muller |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060914003946/http://www.siu.edu/~anthro/muller/SECC/sld008.htm |archivedate=2006-09-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Townsend 2004"&gt;{{cite book |  last = Townsend | first = Richard F., and Robert V. Sharp, eds. |  title = [[Hero, Hawk, and Open Hand]]| publisher = [[The Art Institute of Chicago and Yale University Press]] | year = 2004 |  isbn = 0-300-10601-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This development appears to have no direct links to [[Mesoamerica]], but developed independently.  This ceremonial complex represents a major component of the [[religion]] of the Mississippian peoples, and is one of the primary means by which their religion is understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |  editors = F. Kent Reilly and James Garber  |  title = [[Ancient Objects and Sacred Realms]] | publisher = [[University of Texas Press]] | year = 2007 |  isbn = 978-0-292-71347-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Obsolete names for this ceremonial complex, found in some anthropological sources, include Buzzard Cult and Southern Death Cult.&lt;ref name="hrnrkmp"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Hill|editor1-first=Samuel S.|editor2-last=Lippy|editor2-first=Charles H.|editor3-last=Wilson|editor3-first=Charles Reagan|title=Encyclopedia of Religion in the South|chapter=Native American Religions Pre-Contact Period|last=Hornerkamp|first=Nicholas|pages=542–545}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories and names==
Much of what is called a "complex" was more of an "exchange network." This kind of network may be illustrated by a pair of [[shell gorget]]s whose representation is so similar as to suggest that they were made by the same artist. One is found in southeast [[Missouri]] and the other in [[Spiro Mounds]] in [[Oklahoma]]. Numerous other pairs of extremely similar gorgets serve to link sites across the entire Southeast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siu.edu/~anthro/muller/SECC/sld008.htm |title=Connections |author=Muller |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060914003946/http://www.siu.edu/~anthro/muller/SECC/sld008.htm |archivedate=2006-09-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The social organization of the Mississippian culture was based on [[warfare]], which was represented by an array of motifs and symbols in articles made from costly raw materials, such as [[conch]]es from [[Florida]], [[copper]] from the [[Great Lakes]] area and Appalachian Mountains, [[lead]] from northern [[Illinois]] and [[Iowa]], pottery from [[Tennessee]], and stone tools sourced from [[Kansas]], [[Texas]], and [[Mill Creek chert|southern Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://archaeology.about.com/od/archaeologicals4/a/spiro.htm|title=Spiro Mounds-A Ceremonial Center of the Southern Cult| accessdate=September 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such objects occur in [[Birdman burial|elite burial]]s, together with war [[axe]]s, [[Mace (bludgeon)|maces]], and other weapons. These warrior symbols occur alongside other artifacts, which bear cosmic imagery depicting animals, humans, and mythic beasts. This symbolic imagery bound together warfare, [[cosmology]], and nobility into a coherent whole. Some of these categories of artifacts were used as markers of chiefly office, which varied from one location to another. The term Southeast Ceremonial Complex refers to a complex, highly variable set of religious mechanisms that supported the authority of local [[tribal chief|chiefs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/~coupland/ANT310/lectures/woodlnd3.htm|title=The Late Woodland Period| accessdate=September 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''S.E.C.C.'' was first defined in 1945 by the archaeologists [[Antonio J. Waring, Jr.|Antonio Waring]] and [[Preston Holder]] as a series of four lists of traits, which they categorized as the ''Southeastern (centered) Ceremonial Complex''. Their concept was of a complex of a specific cult manifestation that originated with [[Muskogean languages|Muskogean speakers]] in the southern United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |  editor= Williams, S.|author =Waring, A.J.

In 1989 scholars proposed a more archaeologically based definition for the Mississippian artistic tradition. [[Jon Muller]] of [[Southern Illinois University]] proposes the classification of the complex into five [[Archaeological horizon|horizons]], with each as a discrete tradition defined by the origin of specific motifs and ritual objects, and the specific developments in long-distance exchange and political structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor= Galloway, Patricia|author =Muller, Jon|  title=The Southeastern Ceremonial Complex, Artifacts and Analysis:The Cottonlandia Conference| article = The Southern Cult | publisher = University of Nebraska Press| year = 1989 | pages = 11–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
With the redefinition of the complex, some scholars have suggested choosing a new name to exemplify the new understanding of the large body of art symbols classified as the S.E.C.C. Participants of a decade-long series of conferences held at [[Texas State University]] have proposed the terms ''"Mississippian Ideological Interaction Sphere"'' or ''"M.I.I.S."'' and ''"Mississippian Art and Ceremonial Complex"'' or ''"M.A.C.C."''  Present theories suggest that the complex developed from pre-existing beliefs spread over the midwest and southeast by the [[Hopewell tradition|Hopewell Interaction Sphere]] from 100 BCE to 500 CE.&lt;ref name="Townsend 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="University of Texas Press"&gt;{{cite book |  editors = F. Kent Reilly and James Garber  |  title = [[Ancient Objects and Sacred Realms]] | publisher = [[University of Texas Press]] | year = 2007 | pages = 29–34 |  isbn = 978-0-292-71347-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The major expression of the complex developed at the [[Cahokia]] site and is known as the Braden Style; it corresponds with the Southern Cult Period horizon defined by Muller. Other regional styles developed as a result of the fusion of ideas borrowed from the Braden Style and pre-existing local expressions of post-Hopewellian traditions.&lt;ref name="Townsend 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="University of Texas Press"/&gt;

As the major centers, such as Cahokia, collapsed and the trade networks broke down, the regional styles diverged more from the ''Braden Style'' and from each other. During the ensuing centuries, the local traditions diverged into the religious beliefs and cosmologies of the different historic tribes known to exist at the time of European contact.

==Cosmology==
[[File:S.E.C.C. world tree HRoe 2008.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|The Cedar Tree Axis Mundi]]
[[File:S.E.C.C. striped pole and Hero Twins HRoe 2008.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|The Striped Pole Axis Mundi]]
Most S.E.C.C. imagery focuses on [[cosmology]] and the supernatural beings who inhabit the cosmos. The cosmological map encompassed real, knowable locations, whether in this world or the supernatural reality of the Otherworld. S.E.C.C. iconography portrayed the cosmos in three levels. The Above World or Overworld, was the home of the [[Thunderbird (mythology)|Thunderers]], the Sun, Moon, and Morning Star or [[Red Horn (legend)|Red Horn]] / ''"He Who Wears Human Heads For Earrings"'' and represented Order and Stability. The Middle World was the Earth that humans live in. The Beneath World or Under World was a cold, dark place of Chaos that was home to the [[underwater panther|Underwater Panther]] and Corn Mother or "Old Woman Who Never Dies".

These three worlds were connected by an ''[[axis mundi]]'', usually portrayed as a [[Eastern red cedar|cedar]] tree or a striped pole reaching from the Under World to the Over World.  Each of the three levels also was believed to have its own sub-levels.  Deeply ingrained in the world view was the concept of [[Dualistic cosmology|duality]] and opposition.  The beings of the Upper and Under realms were in constant opposition to each other.  Ritual and ceremony were the means by which these powerful forces could be accessed and harnessed.&lt;ref name="Townsend 2004"/&gt;

===Motifs===
Many common motifs in S.E.C.C. artwork are locative symbols that help determine where the action takes place and where the beings originated.

|| [[File:S.E.C.C. Ogee Motif HRoe 2012.jpg|50px|Ogee Motif]]
|| The Ogee Motif symbolized portals into the Underworld. It appears frequently on Under World Deities. It may symbolize caves, may be derived from representations of female genitalia, or may represent the dorsal markings of the copperhead ([[Agkistrodon contortrix]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite| title= Middle Cumberland Female Effigies and the Portal to the Beneath World| author=Sharp, Robert V.| date=2013 | url= https://www.academia.edu/15151284/Middle_Cumberland_Female_Effigies_and_the_Portal_to_the_Beneath_World | accessdate = 2018-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
|  Striped-Center-Pole Motif
|| [[File:Motif S.E.C.C. stripped pole HRoe 2008.jpg|50px|Striped center Pole Motif]]
|| The Cedar Tree and Striped Pole Motif represent the [[Axis Mundi]] or "world tree", a central axis on which all the worlds rotated and were connected. It would have had alternating bands of red and white. It is often augmented with raccoon skin bundles, Ogee Motifs, and anthropomorphic heads.
|-
|  Trilobed Motif
|| [[File:Motif S.E.C.C. trilobed arrow2 HRoe 2008.jpg|50px|Trilobed Motif]]
|| The Tri-lobed Motif functioned as a serpent marking and may have symbolized a supernatural's ability to travel from the Lower World to the Upper World.
|-
| Bi-Lobed Arrow Motif
||[[File:Motif S.E.C.C. trilobed arrow HRoe 2008.jpg|50px|Bi-Lobed Arrow Motif]]
|| The Bi-Lobed Arrow Motif is often seen in the headdresses of the warriors/birdmen/chunkey players. A complex symbol, it is a graphic representation of a bow and arrow, an ''[[atlatl]]'', or possibly a ''[[ceremonial pipe]]''. In the [[Red Horn (man)|Red Horn]] Cycle, Red Horn is also called "He who gets hit with deer lungs", which may be a euphemism or an allusion to the fact that deer lungs with the trachea attached, resemble the graphic depiction of the Bi-Lobed Arrow. It may symbolize kinship and adoption rituals related to social hierarchies. Examples in the form of [[Mississippian copper plates]] have been found in many Mississippian culture sites.
|-
| The [[Hamsa|Hand and Eye]] Motif
|| [[File:Motif S.E.C.C. eye in hand HRoe 2008.jpg|50px|Hand in Eye Motif]]
|| The Hand and Eye Motif is a human hand with an eye gazing out from the palm, yet another symbol of deity. It was one of the most common motifs in Mississippian symbolism and may be related to the Ogee Motif, suggesting it represents a portal to the Otherworld.
|-
| Mace Motif
||[[File:Motif S.E.C.C. mace HRoe 2008.jpg|50px|Mace Motif]]
|| The Mace Motif usually is associated with the warrior image and may be combined with other motifs, especially the Cross in Circle Motif. It is a graphic representation of a war club or [[ceremonial mace]], such as the chipped flint and ground stone versions found throughout the southeast.
|-
| Columnella Pendant Motif
||[[File:Motif S.E.C.C. columnella pendant HRoe 2008.jpg|50px|Columnella Pendant Motif]]
|| The Columnella Pendant is a graphic representation of the longitudinal center columnella of a [[whelk]] shell.

===Birdman===
[[File:Chromesun mississippian priest digital painting.jpg|thumb|Illustration of a warrior holding a ceremonial flint mace or war club and a severed head]]
The [[Peregrine falcon|falcon]] is one of the most conspicuous symbols of the S.E.C.C. It was simultaneously an [[avatar]] of warriors and an object of supplication for a lengthy life, healthy family, and a long line of descendants.  Its supernatural origin is placed in the Upper World with a pantheon including the Sun, Moon, and Four Stars.  He is most often represented on precious materials, sometimes shell, most often on beaten copper. He dances, costumed with great ground-sweeping wings and a raptor-beaked mask. In his raised right hand he holds a club,  prepared to strike. In his left he holds rattles fashioned from human skulls.

At [[Cahokia]], the falcon imagery was elaborated in figural expression. It is associated with warfare, high-stakes gaming, and possibly family dynastic ambitions, symbolized by arrow flights and the rising of the pre-dawn [[Venus#Venus in human culture|morning star]] as metaphors for the succession of descendants into the future.  Raptor imagery gained prominence during the [[Hopewell tradition|Hopewell period]], but attained its peak in the Braden Style of the early Mississippian period. It survived afterward in the [[Red Horn(man)|Red Horn]] mythological cycle and native religion of the [[Ho-Chunk]] (Winnebagos), [[Osage Nation|Osage]], [[Ioway]], and other plains [[Siouan]] peoples. In the Braden Style, the Birdman is divided into four categories.

====Red Horn and his sons====
The [[Red Horn (legend)|Red Horn]] Mythic Cycle is from the [[Ho Chunk]], or Winnebago people. The mythic cycle of Red Horn and his sons has certain analogies with the [[Maya Hero Twins|Hero Twins]] mythic cycle of [[Mesoamerica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |  last = Power | first = Susan |  title = [[Early Art of the Southeastern Indians-Feathered Serpents and Winged Beings]] | publisher = [[University of Georgia Press]] | year = 2004 |  isbn = 0-8203-2501-5 | page = 158}}&lt;/ref&gt; Redhorn was known by many names, including "[[Venus#Venus in human culture|Morning Star]]", a reference to his celestial origin, and ''"He who is Struck with Deer Lungs,"'' a possible reference to the Bi-Lobed Arrow Motif. In the episode associated with this name, Red Horn turns into an arrow to win a race. After winning the race, Redhorn creates heads on his earlobes and makes his hair into a long red braid.  Thus he becomes known as ''"Redhorn"'' and as ''"He who has Human Heads as Earlobes"''.

In another episode, Redhorn and his friends are challenged by the Giants to play [[History of lacrosse|ball]] (or possibly chunkey)&lt;ref name="Pauketat 2004"&gt;{{cite book |  last = Pauketat | first = Timothy R.|  title = [[Ancient Cahokia and the Mississippians]]| publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | year = 2004 |  isbn = 0-521-52066-5 |  authorlink = Timothy Pauketat}}&lt;/ref&gt; with their lives staked on the outcome.  The best Giant player was a woman with long red hair identical to Redhorn's.  The little heads on Redhorn's ears caused her to laugh so much that it interfered with her game and the Giants lost.&lt;ref name="University of Texas Press"/&gt; The Giants lost all the other contests as well. Then they challenged Redhorn and his friends to a wrestling match in which they threw all but Red Horn's friend Turtle. Since Redhorn and his fellow spirits lost two out of the three matches, they were all slain.  The two wives of Redhorn were pregnant at the time of his death.  The sons born to each have red hair, with the older one having heads where his earlobes should be, and the younger one having heads in place of his nipples.  The older brother discovers where the Giants keep the heads of Redhorn and his friends.  The two boys use their powers to steal the heads from the Giants, whom they wipe out almost completely.  The boys bring back to life Redhorn, Storms as He Walks, and Turtle. In honor of this feat, Turtle and "Storms as He Walks" promise the boys special weapons.

In another episode, the sons of Redhorn decide to go on the warpath. The older brother asks "Storms as He Walks" for the Thunderbird War bundle. After some effort, it is produced, but the Thunderbirds demand that it have a case. A friend of the sons of Redhorn offers his own body as its case. The boys take the Thunderbird War bundle and with their followers go on a raid to the other side of the sky.&lt;ref name="The Red Horn Cycle"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://hotcakencyclopedia.com/ho.RedhornCycle.html|title=The Red Horn Cycle| accessdate=January 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many S.E.C.C. images seem to be of Red Horn, his companions, and his sons. The characters in the myth seem to be tied integrally to the [[ceremonial pipe|pipe]] ceremony, and its association with kinship and adoption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3904/is_200004/ai_n8897879/pg_7?tag=artBody;col1|title=Of Masks and Myths| accessdate=2008-09-13 |last= Duncan|first=James R|author2=Diaz-Granados, Carol |work=Midcontinental Journal of Archaeology | year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the Bi-Lobed Arrow Motif may be a graphic depiction of the calumet.&lt;ref name="The Red Horn Cycle"/&gt; Other images found in S.E.C.C. art show figures with [[long-nosed god maskette]]s on their ears and in place of their nipples.&lt;ref name="Townsend 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pauketat 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fortunecity.com/marina/caribbean/244/oraltrad.html |title=Archaeology, Ethnicity, and Oral Tradition-Chapter 6 |year=1994 |first=John P. |last=Staeck |accessdate=2008-09-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090726132211/http://www.fortunecity.com/marina/caribbean/244/oraltrad.html |archivedate=2009-07-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Great Serpent===
The [[Horned Serpent|Great Serpent]] (or Horned Serpent) is the most well-known mythological figure from the S.E.C.C. Its roots go back to Hopewell times, if not earlier. It usually is described as horned and winged, although the wings are more an indicator of its celestial origin than an essential form of the creature.  In some versions of [[Shawnee]] myths, the serpent is described as a multi-headed monster with one green and one red horn, horns being a manifestation or marker of its power.  In other myths, it is described as a one-eyed buffalo with one green and one red horn.  The [[Piasa]] figure of the [[Miami tribe|Miami]] was painted on a bluff near present-day [[Alton, Illinois]].  It was described as having the body of a panther, four legs, a human head, an impossibly long tail and horns.

''Mishibizhiw'', the [[Ojibwa]] [[underwater panther]], was a combination of [[rattlesnake]], [[cougar]], [[deer]], and [[hawk]]. Other native peoples also gave descriptions of the being, sometimes now referred to as the ''Spirit Otter'', with the majority seeming to belong to one of two extremes, and a multitude in between.&lt;ref name="University of Texas Press"/&gt;

The Great Serpents, the great denizens of the Underworld, were described as powerful beings who were in constant antagonism with the forces of the Upper World, usually represented by the [[Thunderbird (mythology)|Thunderer]]s (Birdmen or Falcon beings).&lt;ref name="Townsend 2004"/&gt; Although men were to be careful of these beings, they could also be the source of great power. A Shawnee myth tells of the capture and dismemberment of ''Msi Kinepikwa''. The pieces were distributed to the five ''[[sept]]s'' of the tribe, who kept them in their sacred "medicine bundles".&lt;ref name="University of Texas Press"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.geocities.com/southbeach/cove/8286/myth1.html| title=Shawnee Mythology|accessdate = 2013-09-09|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027090132/http://www.geocities.com/southbeach/cove/8286/myth1.html|archivedate=2009-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artifacts with S.E.C.C. imagery==
S.E.C.C. motifs have been found on a variety of non-perishable materials, including [[Shell gorget|shell]], [[Mississippian culture pottery|pottery]], [[Mississippian stone statuary|carved stone]], and copper ([[Wulfing cache]] and [[Etowah plates]]). Undoubtedly many other materials also were used, but haven't survived the intervening centuries. It may be judged by looking at the remaining artifacts that S.E.C.C. practitioners worked with feathers and designs woven into cloth, practiced body painting, and possibly [[tattoo]]ing, as well as having pierced ears. One surviving painting found on a baked clay floor at the [[Wickliffe Mounds]] site suggests they also painted designs in and on their dwellings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://users.stlcc.edu/mfuller/Wickliffe.html| title=The Wickliffe Mounds Site|accessdate=2008-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paintings displaying S.E.C.C. imagery also have been found in caves, most notably [[Dunbar Cave State Park|Mud Glyph Cave]] in Tennessee. Animal images, serpents, and warrior figures occur, as well as winged warriors, horned snakes, stylized birds, maces, and arrows. Their location underneath the Earth probably reflect aspects of Mississippian myth and cosmology concerning the (perhaps sacred) precincts beneath the earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3904/is_200110/ai_n8962063/pg_7|title=Issues in the study of southeastern prehistoric cave art | work=Midcontinental Journal of Archaeology | year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Tenrikyo'''|[[wikt:天|天]][[wikt:理|理]][[wikt:教|教]]|''Tenrikyō''}}, sometimes rendered as '''Tenriism''',&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Hadamitzky, Kimiko Fujie-Winter. ''Kanji Dictionary'' 漢字熟語字典. Tuttle Publishing, 1996. p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Japanese new religion]] which is neither strictly monotheistic nor [[pantheistic]], originating from the teachings of a 19th-century woman named [[Nakayama Miki]], known to her followers as ''Oyasama''.&lt;ref&gt;Fukaya, Tadamasa, "The Fundamental Doctrines of Tenrikyo," Tenrikyo Overseas Mission Department, Tenri-Jihosha, 1960, p.2&lt;/ref&gt; Followers of Tenrikyo believe that God of Origin, God in Truth,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Doctrine of Tenrikyo|date=1954|publisher=Tenrikyo Church Headquarters|page=3|edition=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; known by several names including "Tsukihi,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ofudesaki: The Tip of the Writing Brush|date=1998|publisher=Tenrikyo Church Publishers|location=Tenri, Nara, Japan|page=205, VIII-4|edition=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Tenri-Ō-no-Mikoto]],"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Doctrine of Tenrikyo|date=1954|publisher=Tenrikyo Church Headquarters|location=Tenri, Nara, Japan|page=29|edition=2006, Fourth|quote=We call out the name Tenri-O-no-Mikoto in praise and worship of God the Parent.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Oyagamisama (God the Parent)"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Doctrine of Tenrikyo|date=1954|publisher=Tenrikyo Church Headquarters|location=Tenri, Nara, Japan|page=3|edition=Tenth, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; revealed divine intent through Miki Nakayama as the Shrine of God,&lt;ref&gt;"I wish to receive Miki as the Shrine of God." The Doctrine of Tenrikyo, Tenrikyo Church Headquarters, 2006, p.3.&lt;/ref&gt; and to a lesser extent the roles of the Honseki [[Izo Iburi]] and other leaders. Tenrikyo's worldly aim is to teach and promote the [[Joyous Life]], which is cultivated through acts of charity and mindfulness called ''hinokishin''.

The primary operations of Tenrikyo today are located at [[Tenrikyo Church Headquarters]] ([[Tenri, Nara|Tenri]], [[Nara Prefecture|Nara]], [[Japan]]), which supports 16,833 locally managed churches in Japan,&lt;ref name="sknk"&gt;Japanese Ministry of Education.

Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2002. p. 223. {{ISBN|0-8108-4016-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beliefs==
The ultimate spiritual aim of Tenrikyo is the construction of the Kanrodai, a divinely ordained pillar in an ''[[axis mundi]]'' called the Jiba, and the correct performance of the Kagura ritual around the Kanrodai, which will bring about the salvation of all human beings. The idea of the Jiba as the origin of earthly creation is called ''moto-no-ri'', or the principle of origin. A pilgrimage to the Jiba is interpreted as a return to one's origin, so the greeting ''okaeri nasai'' (welcome home) is seen on many inns in Tenri City.

Other key teachings include:
* ''Tanno'' (Joyous Acceptance) – a constructive attitude towards troubles, illness and difficulties
* ''Juzen-no-Shugo'' – ten principles involved in the creation, which exist in ''Futatsu Hitotsu'' (two-in-one relationships) and are considered to be applied continuously throughout the universe

===Joyous Life===
{{see also|Joyous Life}}
[[Image:Tenrikyo manga.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Frame from a Tenrikyo [[manga]]. The translation of the text is roughly, "Just being alive makes me happy! What a waste it would be not to show some initiative!"]]
The Joyous Life in Tenrikyo is defined as charity and abstention from greed, selfishness, hatred, anger and arrogance. Negative tendencies are not known as [[sin]]s in Tenrikyo, but rather as "dust" that can be swept away from the mind through ''hinokishin'' and ritual. ''Hinokishin'', voluntary effort, is performed not out of a desire to appear selfless, but out of gratitude for ''kashimono-karimono'' and ''shugo'' (providence).

===Ontology===
The most basic teaching of Tenrikyo is ''kashimono-karimono'', meaning "a thing lent, a thing borrowed". The thing that is lent and borrowed is the human body. Tenrikyo followers think of their minds as things that are under their own control, but their bodies are not completely under their control.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Doctrine of Tenrikyo]] Chapter 7: A Thing Lent, A Thing Borrowed pp. 50-57&lt;/ref&gt;

===God===
{{see also|God in Tenrikyo}}

The sacred name of the [[monotheism|single]] [[God]] and [[creator deity|creator]] of the entire universe in Tenrikyo is "Tenri-Ō-no-Mikoto" (天理王命).

Tenri-Ō-no-Mikoto created humankind so that humans may live joyously and to partake in that joy.

The body is a thing borrowed, but the mind alone is one's own, thus it is commonly accepted that Tenri-Ō-no-Mikoto is not omnipotent.

Other gods are considered instruments, such as the Divine Providences, and were also created by Tenri-Ō-no-Mikoto.

Tenrikyo's doctrine names four properties of Tenri-O-no-Mikoto: as the God who became openly revealed in the world, as the creator who created the world and humankind, as the sustainer and protector who gives existence and life to all creation, and as the savior whose intention in becoming revealed is to save all humankind.&lt;ref&gt;A Glossary of Tenrikyo Terms, p.110.&lt;/ref&gt;

Through her scriptures (the [[Mikagura-uta]] and [[Ofudesaki]]), Nakayama conveyed the concept of the divine to her followers in steps.&lt;ref&gt;Tenrikyo, Its History and Teachings, 47-8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fukaya, Yoshikazu. Words of the Path: A Guide to Tenrikyo Terms and Expressions 4-5.&lt;/ref&gt; 

*Firstly as ''Kami'' (神, "spirit/god/deity"). ''[[Kami]]'' was a familiar term for her followers since they commonly referred to the spirits of the [[ethnic religion]] of [[Shinto]], which were worshipped and venerated in [[Japan]]. To differentiate this divinity from the Shinto spirits, Oyasama clarified its characteristics with phrases such as "God of Origin" (''moto no kami'') and "God in Truth" (''jitsu no Kami'').&lt;ref&gt;''A Glossary of Tenrikyo Terms,'' 105, 108-9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The ''Doctrine of Tenrikyo'' opens with the line, "I am God of Origin, God in Truth."&lt;/ref&gt;
*Secondly as ''Tsukihi'' (月日, "Moon-Sun"). The moon and sun could be understood as visual manifestations of the divine. Just as those bodies impartially give the world light and warmth at all times of the day, the workings of the divine are also impartial and constant.&lt;ref&gt;''A Glossary of Tenrikyo Terms,'' 454-5.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Finally as ''Oya'' (をや&lt;!--this is the correct hiragana...not the common おや --&gt;, "Parent"). The relationship between the divine and human beings is the mutual feeling of love between a parent and his or her children. The divine does not want to command and punish human beings, but rather to guide and nurture them so that they may live joyfully and cheerfully together. ''Oya'' is both paternal and maternal, not simply one or the other.&lt;ref&gt;''A Glossary of Tenrikyo Terms,'' 274-5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Tenrikyo Christian Dialogue,'' 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

These steps have been described as an "unfolding in the revelation of God's nature in keeping with the developing capacity of human understanding, from an all-powerful God, to a nourishing God, and finally to an intimate God."&lt;ref&gt;Kisala, Robert (2001). "Images of God in Japanese New Religions." Bulletin of the Nanzan Institute for Religion &amp; Culture, 25, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Followers use the phrase "God the Parent" (''Oyagamisama'') to refer to God, and the divine name "Tenri-O-no-Mikoto" when praising or worshipping God through prayer or ritual.&lt;ref&gt;A Glossary of Tenrikyo Terms, p.109.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Causality===
====Comparison to karmic belief====
{{see also|Karma}}
The concept of "causality" (''innen'' いんねん) in Tenrikyo is a unique understanding of [[karma|karmic belief]]. Though causality resembles karmic beliefs found in religious traditions originating in ancient India, such as [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]], Tenrikyo's doctrine does not claim to inherit the concept from these traditions and differs from their explanations of karma in a few significant ways.

Broadly speaking, karma refers to the spiritual principle of cause and effect where intent and actions of an individual (cause) influence the future of that individual (effect).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/312474/karma Karma] Encyclopædia Britannica (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, a person's good intent and good deed contribute to good karma and future happiness, while bad intent and bad deed contribute to bad karma and future suffering.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence C. Becker &amp; Charlotte B. Becker, Encyclopedia of Ethics, 2nd Edition, {{ISBN|0-415-93672-1}}, Hindu Ethics, pp 678&lt;/ref&gt; Causality and karma are interchangeable in this sense;&lt;ref&gt;Kisala, Robert. "Contemporary Karma: Interpretations of Karma in Tenrikyō and Risshō Kōseikai." Japanese Journal of Religious Studies, Vol. 21, No. 1 (Mar., 1994), pp. 73-91: "In accord with traditional karmic understanding, it is the accumulation of bad innen that is offered as the explanation for present suffering."&lt;/ref&gt; throughout life a person may experience good and bad causality. In Tenrikyo, the concept is encapsulated in the farming metaphor, "every seed sown will sprout."&lt;ref&gt;Fukaya, Yoshikazu. "Every Seed Sown Will Sprout." ''Words of the Path.'' [http://www.tenrikyo.or.jp/en/newsletter/html/tt5/innen.html online link]&lt;/ref&gt; Karma is closely associated with the idea of [[Reincarnation|rebirth]],&lt;ref name=jamesloch&gt;James Lochtefeld (2002), The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Rosen Publishing, New York, {{ISBN|0-8239-2287-1}}, pp 351-352&lt;/ref&gt; such that one's past deeds in the current life and in all previous lives are reflected in the present moment, and one's present deeds are reflected in the future of the current life and in all future lives.&lt;ref name=jbowker&gt;"Karma" in: John Bowker (1997), The Concise Oxford Dictionary of World Religions, Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This understanding of rebirth is upheld in causality as well.&lt;ref&gt;Kisala, p.77. "...traditional karmic beliefs in personal responsibility, extending over innumerable lifetimes, are upheld in doctrines concerning individual innen."&lt;/ref&gt; 

Tenrikyo's [[ontology]], however, differs from older karmic religious traditions such as Buddhism. In Tenrikyo, the human person is believed to consist of [[mind]], [[Human body|body]], and [[soul]]. The mind, which is given the freedom to sense, feel, and act by God the Parent, ceases to function at death. On the other hand, the soul, through the process of ''denaoshi'' (出直し, "to make a fresh start"), takes on a new body lent from God the Parent and is reborn into this world. Thought the reborn person has no memory of the previous life, the person's thoughts and deeds leave their mark on the soul and are carried over into the new life as the person's causality.&lt;ref&gt;Kisala, p.77.&lt;/ref&gt; As can be seen, Tenrikyo's ontology, which rests on the existence on a single creator deity (God the Parent), differs from Buddhist ontology, which does not contain a creator deity. Also Tenrikyo's concept of salvation, which is to live the Joyous Life in this existence and therefore does not promise a liberated afterlife outside of this existence, differs from Buddhist concepts of [[saṃsāra]] and [[nirvana]].&lt;ref&gt;''Tenrikyo-Christian Dialogue'', p. 429-430.&lt;/ref&gt;

===="Original causality"====
At the focal point of Tenrikyo's ontological understanding is the positing of "original causality," or "causality of origin" (''moto no innen'' もとのいんねん), which is that God the Parent created human beings to see them live the Joyous Life (the salvific state) and to share in that joy. Tenrikyo teaches that the Joyous Life will eventually encompass all humanity, and that gradual progress towards the Joyous Life is even now being made with the guidance of divine providence. Thus the concept of original causality has a [[teleological]] element, being the gradual unfolding of that which was ordained at the beginning of time.&lt;ref&gt;Kisala, p.77.&lt;/ref&gt;

===="Individual causality"====
Belief in individual causality is related to the principle of original causality. Individual causality is divine providence acting to realize the original causality of the human race, which through the use of suffering guides individuals to realize their causality and leads them to a change of heart and active cooperation towards the establishment of the Joyous Life, the world that was ordained at the beginning of time.&lt;ref&gt;Kisala, p.77-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tenrikyo's doctrine explains that an individual's suffering should not be perceived as punishment or [[retributive justice]] from divine providence for past misdeeds, but rather as a sign of encouragement from divine providence for the individual to reflect on the past and to undergo a change of heart. The recognition of the divine providence at work should lead to an attitude of ''tanno'' (たんのう "joyous acceptance" in Tenrikyo gloss), a Japanese word that indicates a state of satisfaction. ''Tanno'' is a way of settling the mind – it is not to merely resign oneself to one’s situation, but rather to actively “recognize God’s parental love in all events and be braced by their occurrence into an ever firmer determination to live joyously each day.”&lt;ref&gt;Doctrine of Tenrikyo, Tenrikyo Church HQ, 61.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, Tenrikyo emphasizes the importance of maintaining a positive inner disposition, as opposed to a disposition easily swayed by external circumstance.&lt;ref&gt;Kisala, p.78.&lt;/ref&gt;

===="Three causalities"====
In addition, ''The Doctrine of Tenrikyo'' names three causalities (''san innen'' さんいんねん) that are believed to predetermine the founding of Tenrikyo's teachings. More precisely, these causalities are the fulfillment of the promise that God made to the models and instruments of creation, which was that "when the years equal to the number of their first born had elapsed, they would be returned to the Residence of Origin, the place of original conception, and would be adored by their posterity."&lt;ref&gt;''The Doctrine of Tenrikyo'', p.20.&lt;/ref&gt; The "Causality of the Soul of Oyasama" denotes that Miki Nakayama had the soul of the original mother at creation (''Izanami-no-Mikoto''), who conceived, gave birth to, and nurtured humankind. The "Causality of the Residence" means that the Nakayama Residence, where [[Tenrikyo Church Headquarters]] stands, is the place that humankind was conceived. The "Causality of the Promised Time" indicates that October 26, 1838 – the day when God became openly revealed through Miki Nakayama – marked the time when the years equal to the number of first-born humans (900,099,999) had elapsed since the moment humankind was conceived.&lt;ref&gt;''A Glossary of Tenrikyo Terms,'' p.436.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Texts==
===Scriptures===
The three scriptures (''sangenten'' 三原典) of Tenrikyo are the ''[[Ofudesaki]]'', ''[[Mikagura-uta]]'', and ''[[Osashizu]].''

The ''[[Ofudesaki]]'' (おふでさき, "Tip of the Writing Brush") is the most important Tenrikyo scripture. A 17-volume collection of 1,711 waka poems, the Ofudesaki was composed by the foundress of Tenrikyo, Miki Nakayama, from 1869 to 1882.

The ''[[Mikagura-uta]]'' (みかぐらうた "The Songs for the Service") is the text of the [[Service (Tenrikyo)|Service]] (''otsutome''), a religious [[ritual]] that has a central place in Tenrikyo.&lt;ref&gt;The importance of the Service to Tenrikyo followers can be appreciated if one understands that the main theme of the [[Ofudesaki]], the most important of the three Tenrikyo scriptures, has been described as "a development toward the perfection of ''Tsutome'', the Service, through which, alone, human salvation can be realized." See Inoue and Enyon, ''A Study of the Ofudesaki'', xix.&lt;/ref&gt; During the Service, the text to the Mikagura-uta is sung together with dance movements and musical accompaniment, all of which was composed and taught by [[Miki Nakayama]].

The ''[[Osashizu]]'' (おさしづ "Divine Directions") is a written record of oral revelations given by [[Izo Iburi]]. The full scripture is published in seven volumes (plus an index in three volumes) and contains around 20,000 "divine directions" delivered between January 4, 1887 and June 9, 1907.&lt;ref&gt;Tenrikyo Overseas Department, trans. 2010. ''A Glossary of Tenrikyo Terms'', p. 72. Note: This work presents an abridged translation of the ''Kaitei Tenrikyo jiten'', compiled by the Oyasato Institute for the Study of Religion and published in 1997 by Tenrikyo Doyusha Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Shozen Nakayama, the second Shinbashira (the spiritual and administrative leader of Tenrikyo), the Ofudesaki "reveal[s] the most important principles of the faith," the Mikagura-uta “come[s] alive through singing or as the accompaniment" to the Service, and the Osashizu "gives concrete precepts by which the followers should reflect on their own conduct."&lt;ref&gt;"The Various Forms of Verbal Evolution in Tenrikyo Doctrine" that was presented at the 10th Congress of the International Association for the History of Religions held in Marburg in 1960.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Supplemental texts to the scriptures===
The supplemental texts to the scriptures (''jungenten'' 準原典) are officially sanctioned texts which, along with the scriptures, are used to instruct students and adherents of Tenrikyo. They are required texts for students enrolling in Tenrikyo's seminary programs, such as the three-month "Spiritual Development Course" (''Shuyoka'' 修養科).

''[[The Doctrine of Tenrikyo]]'' is Tenrikyo's official [[doctrine]], which explains the basic teachings of Tenrikyo. ''[[The Life of Oyasama|The Life of Oyasama, Foundress of Tenrikyo]]'' is Tenrikyo's [[hagiography]] of Miki Nakayama. The ''[[Anecdotes of Oyasama|Anecdotes of Oyasama, Foundress of Tenrikyo]]'' is an [[anthology]] of anecdotes about Nakayama that were passed down orally by her first followers and later written down and verified.

==Organization ==
{{see also|Tenrikyo Church Headquarters}}
Tenrikyo is subdivided into many different groups with common goals but differing functions. These range from the Daikyokai (lit. large church), to disaster relief corps, medical staff and hospitals, universities, museums, libraries, and various schools.

[[Tenri Judo]] is renowned as a successful competition style of [[Judo]] that has produced many champions, while there are also other sporting and arts interest groups within Tenrikyo.

==History==
{{See also|History of Tenrikyo}}
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2013}}
In Tenrikyo tradition, [[Nakayama Miki]] was chosen as the Shrine of God in 1838, after her son and husband began suffering from serious ailments. The family called a Buddhist monk to exorcise the spirit causing the ailments. When the monk temporarily left and asked Miki to take over, she was possessed by the One god (Tenri-O-no-Mikoto), who demanded that Miki be given to God as a shrine. Miki's husband gave in to this request three days later.

Nakayama Miki's statements and revelations as Shrine of God were supplemented by Izo Iburi, one of her earliest followers, who developed a position of revelatory leadership as her deputy, answering questions from followers and giving "timely talks". His position, which is no longer held in Tenrikyo, was called Honseki. The revelatory transmissions of the Honseki were written down and collected in large, multi-volume works called [[Osashizu]]. Following Izo's death, a woman called Ueda Naraito partially carried on this role for a while, although it appears that she did not the actual title "Honseki". Since then, Tenrikyo itself has never had a Honseki, although some Tenrikyo splinter groups believe that the revelatory leadership passed from Iburi to their particular founder or foundress.

Miki Nakayama's eldest son obtained a license to practice as a low-ranking Shinto priest from the powerful Yoshida branch of Shinto in 1867, but did so against his mother's wishes. Tenrikyo was designated as one of the thirteen groups included in Sect Shinto between 1908 and 1945 under [[State Shinto]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://nirc.nanzan-u.ac.jp/nfile/2789 The Formation of Sect Shinto in Modernizing Japan] Japanese Journal of Religious Studies 29/3-4, Inoue Nobutaka, pp. 406, 416-17&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, Tenrikyo became the first new religion to do social work in Japan, opening an orphanage, a public nursery and a school for the blind.&lt;ref&gt;Isaku Kanzaki. "Present Day Shintoism". In Paul S. Meyer (ed.), ''[https://archive.org/details/japanchristian26unknuoft The Japan Mission Year Book 1928]''. Tokyo: Japan Advertiser Press, 1928.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Tenrikyo is now completely separate from Shinto and Buddhism organizationally,{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} it still shares many of the traditions of Japanese religious practice. For instance, many of the objects used in Tenrikyo religious services, such as [[hassoku]] and [[sanpo]], were traditionally used in Japanese ritual, and the method of offering is also traditional.

[[Image:Tsukinamisai.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Instruments used to perform Otsutome]]
[[File:Tenrikyo-service-music2012.ogg|right|thumb|(audio) Music being performed during a local daily service.]]
Tenrikyo utilises traditional musical instruments in its otsutome (lit. service or duty), [[Hyoshigi]] (wooden clappers), Chanpon (cymbals), Surigane (small gong), [[Taiko]] (large drum), [[Tsuzumi]] (shoulder drum), [[Flute|Fue]] (bamboo flute), [[Shamisen]], [[Kokyū]], and [[Koto (musical instrument)|Koto]]. These are used to play music from the [[Mikagura-Uta]], a body of music, dances and songs created by Nakayama. Most of the world's foremost authorities on [[Gagaku]] music (the ancient classical Shinto music of the imperial court of Japan) are also Tenrikyo followers, and Gagaku music is actively promoted by Tenrikyo, although, strictly speaking, the Mikagura-Uta and Gagaku are separate musical forms.

The Hyoshigi, Chanpon, Surigane, Taiko, and Fue were traditionally the men's instruments but are now acceptable for women to play. The Shamisen, Kokyu, and Koto were traditionally women's instruments and, although not very popular, are now acceptable for men to play as well.

===Daily services===
The [[Otsutome]] or daily service consists of the performance of the seated service and, optionally, the practice of a chapter or two of the 12 chapters of [[Teodori]] (lit. hand dance) or [[Yorozuyo]]. The daily service is performed twice a day; once in the morning and then in the evening. The service times are adjusted according to the time of sun rise and sun set but may vary from church to church. Service times at the Jiba in Tenri City go by this time schedule and adjust in the changing of seasons.

Instruments used in the daily service are the Hyoshigi, Chanpon, Surigane, Taiko, and [[Kazutori]] (a counter, to count the 21 times the first section is repeated). The Hyoshigi is always played by the head minister of the church or mission station. If the head minister is not present, anyone may take his or her place.

The daily service does not need to be performed at a church. It can be done at any time and anywhere, so long as that one faces the direction of the Jiba, or "home of the parent".

The purpose of the daily service, as taught by Miki Nakayama, is to sweep away the [[Eight Mental Dusts]] of the mind.

===Hinokishin===
Hinokishin (lit. daily service) is a spontaneous action that is an expression of gratitude and joy for being allowed to "borrow" his or her body from God the Parent. Such an action ideally is done as an act of religious devotion out of a wish to help or bring joy to others, without any thought of compensation. Hinokishin can range from helping someone to just a simple smile to brighten another person's day. Examples of common Hinokishin activities that are encouraged include cleaning public bathrooms and parks among other such acts of community service. Doing the work that others want to do least are considered sincere in the eyes of God.

Hinokishin is a method of "sweeping" the "mental dusts" that accumulate in our minds. The "mental dusts" are referring to the Eight Mental Dusts. The official translations of these dusts are: Miserliness (Oshii), Covetousness (Hoshii), Hatred (Nikui), Self-love (Kawai), Grudge-bearing (Urami), Anger (Haradachi), Greed (Yoku), Arrogance (Kouman).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tenrikyo.or.jp/eng/?page_id=129 Mental Dusts] Tenrikyo International Website&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tenrikyo Young Men's Association and Tenrikyo Women's Association are Tenrikyo-based groups that perform group activities as public service. To participate in such groups may be considered Hinokishin.

===Monthly services===
[[Image:Montsuki.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Tenrikyo service performers wearing traditional [[montsuki]] after a monthly service.]]
[[Tsukinamisai]] or the monthly service is a performance of the entire [[Mikagura-Uta]], the sacred songs of the service, which is the service for world salvation. Generally, mission headquarters and grand churches (churches with 100 or more others under them) have monthly services performed on the third Sunday of every month; other churches perform on any other Sunday of the month. The monthly service at the Jiba is performed on the 26th of every month, the day of the month in which Tenrikyo was first conceived – October 26, 1838.

Instruments used in the monthly service are all of those aforementioned. Performers also include dancers – three men and three women – and a singer. Performers wear traditional [[montsuki]], which may or may not be required depending on the church.

===Divine Grant of Sazuke===
[[Image:Administering the Sazuke.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A [[Yoboku]] administering the [[Sazuke]] on a follower.]]
The Divine Grant of [[Sazuke]] is a healing prayer in which one may attain through attending the nine [[Besseki]] lectures. When one receives the Divine Grant of Sazuke, he or she is considered a [[Yoboku]] (lit. useful timber). The Sazuke is to be administered to those who are suffering from illness to request God's blessings for a recovery. However, recovery requires the sincere effort from both the recipient and the administrator of the Sazuke to clean their minds of "mental dust." Only with pure minds then can the blessings be received by the recipient through the Yoboku administering the Sazuke. It is taught that when God accepts the sincerity of the person administering the Sazuke and the sincerity of the person to whom it is being administered, a wondrous salvation will be bestowed. This is accomplished through having the recipient be aware of the mental dusts and the teachings of Tenrikyo to remedy their dusty minds.

'''''{{transl|ar|ALA-LC|Ummah}}''''' ({{lang-ar|أمة}} {{IPA-ar|ˈʊm.mæ|}}) is an [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word meaning "[[community]]". It is distinguished from ''{{transl|ar|ALA-LC|Shaʻb}}'' ({{lang|ar|شعب}} {{IPA-ar|ʃæʕb|}}) which means a nation with common ancestry or geography. Thus, it can be said to be a supra-national community with a common history.

It is a synonym for ''{{transl|ar|ALA-LC|ummat al-Islām}}'' ({{lang|ar|أمة الإسلام}}, 'the Islamic community'), and it is commonly used to mean the collective [[Muslim world|community of Islamic peoples]]. In the Quran the ummah typically refers to a single group that shares common religious beliefs, specifically those that are the objects of a divine plan of salvation.&lt;ref name="Houtsma"&gt;{{cite book|last=Houtsma|first=M. Th|title=E.J. Brill's First Encyclopaedia of Islam, 1913-1936|year=1987|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9004082654|pages=125–126|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zJU3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA125#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Houtsma|first=M. Th.|title=E. J. Brill's First Encyclopedia of Islam, 1913-1936|year=1987|publisher=E. J. Brill}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of [[pan-Islamism]] and politics, the word ''{{transl|ar|ALA-LC|ummah}}'' can be used to mean the concept of a ''[[Commonwealth]] of the Believers'' ({{lang|ar|أمة المؤمنين}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA-LC|ummat al-muʼminīn}}'').

==General usage==
The word ''Ummah'' (pl. ''umam'') means [[Nation]] in [[Arabic]]. For example the Arabic term for the United Nations in Arabic is ''الأمم المتحدة Al-Umam Al-Mutahedah'', and the term ''الأمة العربية Al-Ummah Al-Arabeyah'' is used to refer to "The Arabic Nation". &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.almaany.com/ar/dict/ar-en/nation/|title=ترجمة و معنى nation في قاموس المعاني. قاموس عربي انجليزي مصطلحات صفحة 1|first=Almaany|last=Team|website=www.almaany.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Word ''Ummah'' differs from the concept of a country or people. In it is greater context it is used to describe a larger group of people. For example, in Arabic the word شعب ''Sha'ab'' ("people") would be used to describe the citizens of [[Turkey]]. However, the term ''Ummah'' is used to describe the [[Turkic Nation]] as a whole, which includes [[Turkey]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Azerbaijan]], and other countries and ethnic groups in [[Central Asia]].

==Islamic usage and origin==
The phrase ''{{transl|ar|ALA-LC|Ummah Wāhidah}}'' in the [[Quran]] ({{lang|ar|أمة واحدة}}, "One Nation") refers to all the Islamic world as it existed at the time. The Quran says: "You [Muslims] are the best nation brought out for Mankind, commanding what is righteous ({{lang|ar|معروف}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA-LC|Ma'rūf}}'', lit. "recognized [as good]") and forbidding what is wrong ({{lang|ar|منكر}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA-LC|Munkar}}'', lit. "recognized [as evil]")" [3:110].

The usage is further clarified by the [[Constitution of Medina]], an early document said to have been negotiated by [[Muhammad]] in CE 622 with the leading clans of [[Medina]], which explicitly refers to Jewish, Christians 
and pagan citizens of Medina as members of the ''{{transl|ar|ALA-LC|Ummah}}''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Reuven|last=Firestone|title={{transl|ar|ALA-LC|Jihād}}: The Origin of Holy War in Islam|year=1999|location=New York|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=118|isbn=0195125800}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Muhammad|title=Encyclopedia of Islam Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Watt|first=W. Montgomery|year=1956|title=Muhammad at Medina|location=Oxford|publisher=Clarendon Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=R. B.|last=Serjeant|title=The Constitution of Medina|journal=Islamic Quarterly|volume=8|year=1964|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emergence of the Ummah==
At the time of [[Muhammad]], before the conception of the ummah, Arab communities were typically governed by kinship.&lt;ref name=Watt&gt;{{cite book|last=Watt|first=W. Montgomery|title=Muhammad at Medina|year=1972|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the political ideology of the Arabs centered around tribal affiliations and blood-relational ties.&lt;ref name=Watt /&gt; In the midst of a tribal society, the religion of [[Islam]] emerged and along with it the concept of the ummah. The ummah emerged according to the idea that a messenger or prophet has been sent to a community.&lt;ref name=Houtsma /&gt; But unlike earlier messengers who had been sent to various communities in the past (as can be found among the Prophets in the Old Testament), Muhammad sought to develop a universal ummah and not only for the Arabs.&lt;ref name=Houtsma /&gt; Muhammad saw his purpose as the transmission of a divine message, and the leadership of the Islamic community.&lt;ref name=Houtsma /&gt; Islam sees Muhammad as the messenger to the ummah, transmitting a divine message, and implying that God is directing the life affairs of the ummah.&lt;ref name=Watt /&gt; Accordingly, the purpose of the ummah was to be based on religion, following the commands of God, rather than kinship.&lt;ref name=Watt /&gt;

==Usage of Ummah in the Qur'an==
{{Islamism sidebar|Concepts}}
There are a total of sixty-two instances that the term ummah is mentioned in the [[Qur'an]].&lt;ref name=Bearman /&gt; The use of ummah in the Qur'an almost always refers to ethical, linguistic, or religious bodies of people who are subject to the divine plan of salvation.&lt;ref name=Houtsma /&gt;&lt;ref name=Denny&gt;{{cite journal|last=Denny|first=Frederick Mathewson|title=The Meaning of "Ummah" in the Qur'an|journal=History of Religions|date=August 1975|volume=15|issue=1|pages=34–70|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|doi=10.1086/462733}}&lt;/ref&gt; The meaning of the term ummah in the Qur'an appears to transform throughout the chronology of the Qur'an.&lt;ref name=Bearman &gt;{{cite book|last=Bearman|first=P.|title=Encyclopedia of Islam|year=2013|publisher=Brill Online|edition=Second|author2=Th. Bianquis |author3=C. E. Bosworth |author4=E. van Donzel |author5=W. P. Heinrichs |chapter="Umma"}}&lt;/ref&gt; When it is first used in the Qur'an it is hardly distinguishable from the term ''qawm'' which can be translated to 'people'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.almaany.com/en/dict/ar-en/qawm+(people)/?page=2|title=Translation and Meaning of qawm (people) in English Arabic Dictionary of terms Page 2|first=Almaany|last=Team|website=www.almaany.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Qur'an recognizes that each ummah has a messenger that has been sent to relay a divine message to the community and that all ummahs await God's ultimate judgment.&lt;ref name=Watt /&gt;&lt;ref name=Denny /&gt; Although the meaning of the ummah begins simply with a general application of the word, it gradually develops to reference a general religious community and then evolves to specifically refer to the Muslim community.&lt;ref name=Bearman /&gt; Before it refers exclusively to Muslims, the ummah encompasses Jewish and Christian communities as one with the Muslims and refers to them as the [[People of the Book]].&lt;ref name=Watt /&gt;&lt;ref name=Denny /&gt; This is supplemented by the [[Constitution of Medina]] which declares all members of the ummah, regardless of religion, to be of ‘one ummah.'&lt;ref name=Watt /&gt; In these passages of the Qur'an, ummah may be referring to a unity of mankind through the shared beliefs of the monotheistic religions.&lt;ref name=Bearman /&gt; However, Denny points out that the most recent ummah that receives a messenger from God is the Arab ummah.&lt;ref name=Denny /&gt; As the Muslims became stronger during their residence in Medina, the Arab ummah narrowed into an ummah exclusively for Muslims.&lt;ref name=Denny /&gt; This is evidenced by the resacralization of the [[Kaaba]] and Muhammad's command to take a pilgrimage to Mecca, along with the redirection of prayer from Jerusalem to Mecca.&lt;ref name=Denny /&gt; The period in which the term ummah is used most often is within the Third Meccan Period followed by the Medinian period.&lt;ref name=Denny /&gt; The extensive use of the term during these two time periods indicates that Muhammad was beginning to arrive at the concept of the ummah to specify the genuine Muslim community.&lt;ref name=Denny /&gt; Furthermore, the early Meccan passages generally equate ummah as religion, whereas in the Medinan period the passages of the Qur'an refer more specifically to the relation of the ummah and religion.&lt;ref name=Denny /&gt; The final passage that refers to ummah in the Qur'an refers to the Muslims as the "best community" and accordingly led to ummah as an exclusive reference to Islam.&lt;ref name=Denny /&gt;

A verse in the Qur'an also mentions the ummah, in the context of all of the messengers, that this ummah (nation) of theirs is one ummah and that God is their Lord entirely.

&lt;big&gt;"O messengers, eat from the good foods and work righteousness. Indeed, I, of what you do, am Knowing.
And indeed this, your ummah (nation), is one ummah (nation), and I am your Lord, so fear Me."
[Qur'an, Surah Al-Mu'minun (The believers) (23:51-52)] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legacy.quran.com/23/51-52|title=Surat Al-Mu'minun [23:51-52] - The Noble Qur'an - القرآن الكريم|website=legacy.quran.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

==Mecca==
Initially it did not appear that the new Muslim community would oppose the tribes that already existed in Mecca.&lt;ref name=Hodgson /&gt; The first Muslims did not need to make a break with traditional Quraysh customs since the vision for the new community included moral norms that were not unfamiliar to the tribal society of Mecca.&lt;ref name=Hodgson /&gt; However, what distinguished this community from the tribes was its focus of the place of those morals within a person's life.&lt;ref name=Hodgson /&gt;

==Medina==
After Muhammad and the first converts to Islam were forced to leave [[Mecca]], the community was welcomed in Medina by the Ansar, a group of Pagans who had converted to Islam.&lt;ref name=Houtsma /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ye&gt;{{cite book|last=Ye'or|first=Bat|title=The Dhimmi: Jews and Christians under Islam|year=1985|publisher=Associated University Press|location=Cranberry, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Medina already being occupied by numerous Jewish and polytheistic tribes, the arrival of Muhammad and his followers provoked no opposition from Medina's residents.&lt;ref name=Ye/&gt; Upon arriving in Medina, Muhammad established the [[Constitution of Medina]] with the various tribal leaders in order to form the Meccan immigrants and the Medinan residents into a single community, the ummah. Rather than limiting members of the ummah to a single tribe or religious affiliation as had been the case when the ummah first developed in Mecca, the Constitution of Medina ensured that the ummah was composed of a variety of people and beliefs essentially making it to be supra-tribal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goitein|first=S.D.|title=Studies in Islamic History and Institutions|year=1968|publisher=E. J. Brill|location=Leiden, Netherlands}}&lt;/ref&gt; Islamic historian, [[Tabari]], suggested that Muhammad's initial intentions upon arriving in Medina was to establish a mosque, however this is unlikely &lt;ref name=Peters /&gt; Tabari also claimed that Muhammad observed the first Friday prayer in Medina.&lt;ref name=Tabari /&gt; It occurred on Friday because Friday served as a market day in Medina to enable Jews to observe the sabbath.&lt;ref name=Tabari&gt;{{cite journal|last=Watt|first=W. Montgomery|author2=M.V. McDonald |title=The History of al-Tabari: The Foundation of the Community|year=1987|volume=VII|publisher=State University of New York|location=Albany, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; Membership to the ummah was not restricted to adhering to the Muslim faith but rather encompassed all of the tribes as long as they vowed to recognize Muhammad as the community and political figure of authority.&lt;ref name="Peters"&gt;{{cite book|last=Peters|first=Francis E.|authorlink=Francis E. Peters|last2=Esposito|first2=John L.|author2-link=John L. Esposito|title=The children of Abraham: Judaism, Christianity, Islam|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2006|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Zu6EAAAACAAJ|isbn=978-0-691-12769-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Peters|first=F. E.|title=Muhammad and the Origins of Islam|year=1994|publisher=State University of New York|location=Albany, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Constitution of Medina declared that the Jewish tribes and the Muslims from Medina formed 'one ummah.' &lt;ref name=Watt /&gt; It is possible that the Medinan ummah was purely secular (compared to the later transformation of the ummah in Mecca) due to its variety of beliefs and practices of its members.&lt;ref name=Peters /&gt; The purpose of the Constitution of Medina was to uphold political obligations and social relations between the various tribes.&lt;ref name=Peters /&gt; The community members in Medina, although not derived from the same faith, were committed to each other through a desire to defend the common good of the community.&lt;ref name=Peters /&gt; In other words, the community was united according to preserve its shared interests.&lt;ref name=Peters /&gt; The people of other religious beliefs, particularly those that are considered to be "People of the Book" were granted the special protection of God through the [[dhimmi|dhimmah]] contract.&lt;ref name=Watt /&gt; These other religious groups were guaranteed security by God and Muhammad because of their common religious history as being the "[[People of the Book]]." The dhimmah served as a sort of alliance between Muslims and non-Muslims.&lt;ref name=Watt /&gt; In the earlier treaties of the dhimmah, both groups were viewed as equal in status and both were obligated to help the other. However, in later treaties, after Islam had gained more power throughout Arabia, the dhimmah was perceived as the fulfilment of the religious duties of Muslims along with the payment of zakat. With the new contract of dhimmah, non-Muslims' protection by God and Muhammad became dependent on their payment.

===Constitution of Medina===
The Constitution of Medina is a document created by Muhammad to regulate social and political life in Medina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Esposito|first=John L.|title=The Islamic World: Past and Present|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|chapter="Ummah"}}&lt;/ref&gt; It deals with various tribal issues such as the organization and leadership of the participating tribal groups, warfare, blood money, ransom of captives, and war expenditures.&lt;ref name=Lecker&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lecker|first=Michael|title=Constitution of Medina|journal=Encyclopedia of Islam|year=2013|volume=Three}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is at the beginning of the document that the Muslims from the  Quraysh (those from Mecca) and the Muslims from Yathrib (those from Medina) are declared to be an ummah or one community.&lt;ref name=Lecker /&gt; The word ummah appears again when the document refers to the treaty of the Jews and states that the Yahūd Banī ' Awf, or Jews, are an ummah that exists alongside the ummah of the Muslims or may be included in the same ummah as the Muslims.&lt;ref name=Lecker /&gt; The document does state that the Jews who join the Muslims will receive aid and equal rights.&lt;ref name=Lecker /&gt; In addition, the Jews will be guaranteed security from the Muslims, and are granted to maintain their own religion just as the Muslims will maintain theirs.&lt;ref name=Lecker /&gt; This implies that the ummah is not strictly a religious community in Medina.&lt;ref name=Watt /&gt; The Constitution of Medina lists the various Medinan tribes derived from the Aws and Khazraj as well as the several Jewish tribes that are granted to keep their tribal organization and leadership.&lt;ref name=Lecker /&gt; The document also reveals that each group, the Muslims and the Jews, is responsible for its own finances except during time of war, when the two are able to share expenses.&lt;ref name=Watt /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lecker /&gt;

==Back to Mecca==
After the Muslim takeover of Mecca, membership in the ummah required a commitment to Islam.&lt;ref name=Peters /&gt; This happened as a result of Islam beginning to distinguish itself not just from Paganism but also Judaism and Christianity by emphasizing a model of community based on Abraham.&lt;ref name=Hodgson&gt;{{cite book|last=Hodgson|first=Marshall G. S.|title=The Venture of Islam: Conscience and History in a World Civilization|year=1974|publisher=The University of Chicago|location=Chicago, IL}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hodgson /&gt; The membership of the ummah was now based on two main principles; the first is to worship God alone and secondly, in order to worship God properly one must be in a guided community.&lt;ref name=Hodgson /&gt;

The essentials of the new society were the new relations between human beings and God and between human beings and one another. The society was held together by the Prophet. Feuding among Muslim clans was forbidden.&lt;ref name=Hodgson /&gt; Muhammad's community was designed to transform the world itself through action in the world.&lt;ref name=Hodgson /&gt;

The '''World Muslim Congress''' (''Motamar al-Alam al-Islami'') (Arabic: مؤتمر العالم الإسلامي) is an [[Islam]]ic organization based in [[Karachi]]. Its co-founder and Secretary-General for over four decades was [[Inamullah Khan]]. It was the recipient of the 1987 [[Niwano Peace Prize]],&lt;ref&gt;Niwano Peace Foundation, [http://www.npf.or.jp/english/Peace_Prize_Detail/05.html The World Muslim Congress]&lt;/ref&gt; and Khan was the recipient of the 1988 [[Templeton Prize]].&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;''[[New York Times]]'', 19 April 1988, [https://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/19/us/anti-semitism-charges-lead-to-delay-on-religion-prize.html?sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all Anti-Semitism Charges Lead To Delay on Religion Prize]&lt;/ref&gt; It has [[List of organizations with consultative status to the United Nations Economic and Social Council|general consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council]].

The Congress was founded at the 1949 World Muslim Conference in Karachi, following the creation of [[Pakistan]] in 1947. [[Mohammad Amin al-Husayni]], the [[Grand Mufti of Jerusalem]], who presided over the Conference, was elected President of the Congress.&lt;ref name="Haqqani"&gt;Husain Haqqani (2005), May 19, 2005, [http://www.futureofmuslimworld.com/research/detail/the-ideologies-of-south-asian-jihadi-groups The Ideologies of South Asian Jihadi Groups], ''[[Current Trends in Islamist Ideology]]'', vol. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Its cofounder and Secretary-General for over four decades was [[Inamullah Khan]].&lt;ref name=WMC/&gt;

Although formally founded in 1949, the Congress traces its roots to a Congress hosted in [[Mecca]] in 1926 hosted by [[Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia]] shortly after his occupation of Mecca and [[Medina]]; he "hoped [it] would confer Islamic sanction upon his administration of the holy cities, instead [it] leveled many criticisms, and he did not reconvene it."&lt;ref&gt;Martin Kramer, "[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/martinkramerorg/Congresses.htm&amp;date=2009-10-26+02:19:04 Muslim Congresses]", ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Modern Islamic World''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mohammad Amin al-Husayni]] had also been a leading figure at this Congress.&lt;ref name=WMC&gt;World Muslim Congress, [http://www.motamaralalamalislami.org/history.html History]&lt;/ref&gt;
