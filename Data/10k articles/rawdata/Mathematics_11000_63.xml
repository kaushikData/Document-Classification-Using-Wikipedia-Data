[[File:Parallel transport sphere.svg|right|thumb|An affine connection on the sphere rolls the affine tangent plane from one point to another. As it does so, the point of contact traces out a curve in the plane: the [[development (differential geometry)|development]].]]
In the branch of [[mathematics]] called [[differential geometry]], an '''affine connection''' is a geometric object on a [[smooth manifold]] which ''connects'' nearby [[tangent space]]s, so it permits [[vector field|tangent vector fields]] to be [[derivative|differentiated]] as if they were functions on the manifold with values in a fixed [[vector space]]. The notion of an affine connection has its roots in 19th-century geometry and [[tensor calculus]], but was not fully developed until the early 1920s, by [[Élie Cartan]] (as part of his general theory of [[Cartan connection|connections]]) and [[Hermann Weyl]] (who used the notion as a part of his foundations for [[general relativity]]). The terminology is due to Cartan and has its origins in the identification of tangent spaces in [[Euclidean space]] {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} by translation: the idea is that a choice of affine connection makes a manifold look infinitesimally like Euclidean space not just smoothly, but as an [[affine space]].

On any manifold of positive dimension there are infinitely many affine connections. If the manifold is further endowed with a [[Riemannian metric]] then there is a natural choice of affine connection, called the [[Levi-Civita connection]]. The choice of an affine connection is equivalent to prescribing a way of differentiating vector fields which satisfies several reasonable properties ([[linearity]] and the [[product rule|Leibniz rule]]). This yields a possible definition of an affine connection as a [[covariant derivative]] or (linear) [[connection (vector bundle)|connection]] on the [[tangent bundle]]. A choice of affine connection is also equivalent to a notion of [[parallel transport]], which is a method for transporting tangent vectors along curves. This also defines a parallel transport on the [[frame bundle]]. Infinitesimal parallel transport in the frame bundle yields another description of an affine connection, either as a [[Cartan connection]] for the [[affine group]] or as a [[connection (principal bundle)|principal connection]] on the frame bundle.

The main invariants of an affine connection are its [[torsion tensor|torsion]] and its [[curvature]]. The torsion measures how closely the [[Lie derivative|Lie bracket]] of vector fields can be recovered from the affine connection. Affine connections may also be used to define (affine) [[geodesics]] on a manifold, generalizing the ''straight lines'' of Euclidean space, although the geometry of those straight lines can be very different from usual [[Euclidean geometry]]; the main differences are encapsulated in the curvature of the connection.

==Motivation and history==

A [[smooth manifold]] is a [[mathematical]] object which looks locally like a smooth deformation of Euclidean space {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}: for example a smooth curve or surface looks locally like a smooth deformation of a line or a plane. [[Smooth function]]s and [[vector field]]s can be defined on manifolds, just as they can on Euclidean space, and [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] functions on manifolds can be differentiated in a natural way. However, differentiation of vector fields is less straightforward: this is a simple matter in Euclidean space, because the tangent space of based vectors at a point {{mvar|p}} can be identified naturally (by translation) with the tangent space at a nearby point {{mvar|q}}. On a general manifold, there is no such natural identification between nearby tangent spaces, and so tangent vectors at nearby points cannot be compared in a well-defined way. The notion of an affine connection was introduced to remedy this problem by ''connecting'' nearby tangent spaces. The origins of this idea can be traced back to two main sources: [[Differential geometry of surfaces|surface theory]] and [[tensor calculus]].

===Motivation from surface theory===

{{see also|Cartan connection}}

Consider a smooth surface {{mvar|S}} in 3-dimensional Euclidean space. Near to any point, {{mvar|S}} can be approximated by its [[tangent plane]] at that point, which is an [[affine subspace]] of Euclidean space. Differential geometers in the 19th century were interested in the notion of [[development (differential geometry)|development]] in which one surface was ''rolled'' along another, without ''slipping'' or ''twisting''. In particular, the tangent plane to a point of {{mvar|S}} can be rolled on {{mvar|S}}: this should be easy to imagine when {{mvar|S}} is a surface like the 2-sphere, which is the smooth boundary of a [[convex set|convex]] region. As the tangent plane is rolled on {{mvar|S}}, the point of contact traces out a curve on {{mvar|S}}. Conversely, given a curve on {{mvar|S}}, the tangent plane can be rolled along that curve. This provides a way to identify the tangent planes at different points along the curve: in particular, a tangent vector in the tangent space at one point on the curve is identified with a unique tangent vector at any other point on the curve. These identifications are always given by [[affine transformation]]s from one tangent plane to another.

This notion of parallel transport of tangent vectors, by affine transformations, along a curve has a characteristic feature: the point of contact of the tangent plane with the surface ''always moves'' with the curve under parallel translation (i.e., as the tangent plane is rolled along the surface, the point of contact moves). This generic condition is characteristic of [[Cartan connection]]s. In more modern approaches, the point of contact is viewed as the ''origin'' in the tangent plane (which is then a vector space), and the movement of the origin is corrected by a translation, so that parallel transport is linear, rather than affine.

In the point of view of Cartan connections, however, the affine subspaces of Euclidean space are ''model'' surfaces &amp;mdash; they are the simplest surfaces in Euclidean 3-space, and are homogeneous under the affine group of the plane &amp;mdash; and every smooth surface has a unique model surface tangent to it at each point. These model surfaces are ''Klein geometries'' in the sense of [[Felix Klein]]'s [[Erlangen programme]]. More generally, an {{mvar|n}}-dimensional affine space is a [[Klein geometry]] for the [[affine group]] {{math|Aff(''n'')}}, the stabilizer of a point being the [[general linear group]] {{math|GL(''n'')}}. An affine {{mvar|n}}-manifold is then a manifold which looks infinitesimally like {{mvar|n}}-dimensional affine space.

===Motivation from tensor calculus===
{{see also|covariant derivative}}

[[File:Affine connection example.svg|thumbnail|Historically, people used covariant derivative (or Levi-Civita connection given by metric) to describe the variation rate of a vector along the direction of another vector. Here on the punctured 2-dimensional Euclidean space, the blue vector field {{mvar|X}} sends the [[one-form]] {{math|d''r''}} to 1 everywhere. The red vector field {{mvar|Y}} sends the one-form {{math|d''θ''}} to {{mvar|r}} everywhere. Endorsed by the metric {{math|d''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} d''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + d''θ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, the Levi-Civita connection {{math|∇&lt;sub&gt;''Y''&lt;/sub&gt;''X''}} is 0 everywhere, indicating {{mvar|X}} has no change along {{mvar|Y}}. In other words, {{mvar|X}} [[parallel transport]]s along each [[concentric]] circle. {{math|∇&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;''Y''}} sends {{math|d''θ''}} to 1 everywhere, implying {{mvar|Y}} has a "constant" changing rate on the radial direction.]]
The second motivation for affine connections comes from the notion of a [[covariant derivative]] of vector fields. Before the advent of coordinate-independent methods, it was necessary to work with vector fields by [[embedding]] their respective [[Euclidean vector]]s into an [[Atlas (topology)|atlas]]. These components can be differentiated, but the derivatives do not transform in a manageable way under changes of coordinates.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} Correction terms were introduced by [[Elwin Bruno Christoffel]] (following ideas of [[Bernhard Riemann]]) in the 1870s so that the (corrected) derivative of one vector field along another transformed [[covariant transformation|covariantly]] under coordinate transformations &amp;mdash; these correction terms subsequently came to be known as [[Christoffel symbol]]s.

This idea was developed into the theory of ''absolute differential calculus'' (now known as [[tensor calculus]]) by [[Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro]] and his student [[Tullio Levi-Civita]] between 1880 and the turn of the 20th century.

Tensor calculus really came to life, however, with the advent of [[Albert Einstein]]'s theory of [[general relativity]] in 1915. A few years after this, Levi-Civita formalized the unique connection associated to a Riemannian metric, now known as the [[Levi-Civita connection]]. More general affine connections were then studied around 1920, by [[Hermann Weyl]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Weyl|1918}}, 5 editions to 1922.&lt;/ref&gt; who developed a detailed mathematical foundation for general relativity, and [[Élie Cartan]],&lt;ref name="Cartan-affine"&gt;{{Harvnb|Cartan|1923}}.&lt;/ref&gt; who made the link with the geometrical ideas coming from surface theory.

===Approaches===

The complex history has led to the development of widely varying approaches to and generalizations of the affine connection concept.

The most popular approach is probably the definition motivated by covariant derivatives. On the one hand, the ideas of Weyl were taken up by physicists in the form of [[gauge theory]] and [[gauge covariant derivative]]s. On the other hand, the notion of covariant differentiation was abstracted by [[Jean-Louis Koszul]], who defined (linear or Koszul) [[connection (vector bundle)|connections]] on [[vector bundle]]s. In this language, an affine connection is simply a [[covariant derivative]] or (linear) [[connection (vector bundle)|connection]] on the [[tangent bundle]].

However, this approach does not explain the geometry behind affine connections nor how they acquired their name.{{efn|As a result, many mathematicians use the term ''linear connection'' (instead of ''affine connection'') for a connection on the tangent bundle, on the grounds that [[parallel transport]] is linear and not affine. However, the same property holds for any (Koszul or linear Ehresmann) [[connection (vector bundle)|connection on a vector bundle]]. Originally the term ''affine connection'' is short for an affine ''[[Cartan connection|connection]]'' in the sense of Cartan, and this implies that the connection is defined on the tangent bundle, rather than an arbitrary vector bundle. The notion of a linear Cartan connection does not really make much sense, because linear representations are not transitive.}} The term really has its origins in the identification of tangent spaces in Euclidean space by translation: this property means that Euclidean {{mvar|n}}-space is an [[affine space]]. (Alternatively, Euclidean space is a [[principal homogeneous space]] or [[torsor]] under the group of translations, which is a subgroup of the affine group.) As mentioned in the introduction, there are several ways to make this precise: one uses the fact that an affine connection defines a notion of [[parallel transport]] of vector fields along a curve. This also defines a parallel transport on the [[frame bundle]]. Infinitesimal parallel transport in the frame bundle yields another description of an affine connection, either as a Cartan connection for the affine group {{math|Aff(''n'')}} or as a principal {{math|GL(''n'')}} connection on the frame bundle.

==Formal definition as a differential operator==

{{see also|covariant derivative|connection (vector bundle)}}

Let {{mvar|M}} be a smooth [[manifold]] and let {{math|''C''&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'', T''M'')}} be the space of [[vector fields]] on {{mvar|M}}, that is, the space of [[section (fiber bundle)|smooth sections]] of the [[tangent bundle]] {{math|T''M''}}. Then an '''affine connection''' on {{mvar|M}} is a [[bilinear map]]

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
C^\infty(M,\mathrm{T}M)\times C^\infty(M,\mathrm{T}M) &amp; \rightarrow C^\infty(M,\mathrm{T}M)\\
(X,Y) &amp; \mapsto \nabla_X Y\,,\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
such that for all smooth functions {{mvar|f}} in {{math|''C''&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'', '''R''')}} and all vector fields {{math|''X'', ''Y''}} on {{mvar|M}}:
# {{math|∇''&lt;sub&gt;fX&lt;/sub&gt;Y'' {{=}} ''f'' ∇''&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;Y''}}, that is, {{math|∇}} is {{math|''C''&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'', '''R''')}}-''linear'' in the first variable;
# {{math|∇''&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;''(&amp;thinsp;''fY''&amp;thinsp;) {{=}} d''f''&amp;thinsp;(''X'')''Y'' + ''f'' ∇''&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;Y''}}, that is, {{math|∇}} satisfies ''Leibniz rule'' in the second variable.

===Elementary properties===

* It follows from property 1 above that the value of {{math|∇&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;''Y''}} at a point {{math|''x'' ∈ ''M''}} depends only on the value of {{mvar|X}} at {{mvar|x}} and not on the value of {{mvar|X}} on {{math|''M'' − {''x''}|}}. It also follows from property 2 above that the value of {{math|∇&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;''Y''}} at a point {{math|''x'' ∈ ''M''}} depends only on the value of {{mvar|Y}} on a neighbourhood of {{mvar|x}}.
* If {{math|∇&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, ∇&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} are affine connections then the value at {{mvar|x}} of {{math|∇{{su|p=1|b=''X''}}''Y'' − ∇{{su|p=2|b=''X''}}''Y''}} may be written {{math|Γ&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} where
::&lt;math&gt;\Gamma_x : \mathrm{T}_xM \times \mathrm{T}_xM \to \mathrm{T}_xM&lt;/math&gt;
:is bilinear and depends smoothly on {{mvar|x}} (i.e., it defines a smooth [[bundle homomorphism]]). Conversely if {{math|∇}} is an affine connection and {{math|Γ}} is such a smooth bilinear bundle homomorphism (called a [[connection form]] on {{mvar|M}}) then {{math|∇ + Γ}} is an affine connection.

* If {{mvar|M}} is an open subset of {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, then the tangent bundle of {{mvar|M}} is the [[trivial bundle]] {{math|''M'' × '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. In this situation there is a canonical affine connection {{math|d}} on {{mvar|M}}: any vector field {{mvar|Y}} is given by a smooth function {{mvar|V}} from {{mvar|M}} to {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}; then {{math|d&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;''Y''}} is the vector field corresponding to the smooth function {{math|d''V''(''X'') {{=}} ∂&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;''Y''}} from {{mvar|M}} to {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Any other affine connection {{math|∇}} on {{mvar|M}} may therefore be written {{math|∇ {{=}} d + Γ}}, where {{math|Γ}} is a connection form on {{mvar|M}}.
* More generally, a [[local trivialization]] of the tangent bundle is a [[bundle map|bundle isomorphism]] between the restriction of {{math|T''M''}} to an open subset {{mvar|U}} of {{mvar|M}}, and {{math|''U'' × '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. The restriction of an affine connection {{math|∇}} to {{mvar|U}} may then be written in the form {{math|d + Γ}} where {{math|Γ}} is a connection form on {{mvar|U}}.

==Parallel transport for affine connections==

{{see also|parallel transport}}

[[File:Parallel transport sphere2.svg|thumb|right|Parallel transport of a tangent vector along a curve in the sphere.]]
Comparison of tangent vectors at different points on a manifold is generally not a well-defined process. An affine connection provides one way to remedy this using the notion of [[parallel transport]], and indeed this can be used to give a definition of an affine connection.

Let {{mvar|M}} be a manifold with an affine connection {{math|∇}}. Then a vector field {{mvar|X}} is said to be '''parallel''' if {{math|∇''X'' {{=}} 0}} in the sense that for any vector field {{mvar|Y}}, {{math|∇&lt;sub&gt;''Y''&lt;/sub&gt;''X'' {{=}} 0}}. Intuitively speaking, parallel vectors have ''all their [[derivative]]s equal to zero'' and are therefore in some sense ''constant''. By evaluating a parallel vector field at two points {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}}, an identification between a tangent vector at {{mvar|x}} and one at {{mvar|y}} is obtained. Such tangent vectors are said to be '''parallel transports''' of each other.

Nonzero parallel vector fields do not, in general, exist, because the equation {{math|∇''X'' {{=}} 0}} is a [[partial differential equation]] which is [[overdetermined system|overdetermined]]: the [[integrability condition]] for this equation is the vanishing of the '''curvature''' of {{math|∇}} (see below). However, if this equation is restricted to a [[curve]] from {{mvar|x}} to {{mvar|y}} it becomes an [[ordinary differential equation]]. There is then a unique solution for any initial value of {{mvar|X}} at {{mvar|x}}.

More precisely, if {{math|''γ'' : ''I'' → ''M''}} a [[curve|smooth curve]] parametrized by an interval {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} and {{math|''ξ'' ∈ T&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;''M''}}, where {{math|''x'' {{=}} ''γ''(''a'')}}, then a [[vector field]] {{mvar|X}} along {{mvar|γ}} (and in particular, the value of this vector field at {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''γ''(''b'')}}) is called the '''parallel transport of {{mvar|ξ}} along {{mvar|γ}}''' if
#{{math|∇&lt;sub&gt;''γ′''(''t'')&lt;/sub&gt;''X'' {{=}} 0}}, for all {{math|''t'' ∈ [''a'', ''b'']}}
#{{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;''γ''(''a'')&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''ξ''}}.
Formally, the first condition means that {{mvar|X}} is parallel with respect to the [[pullback (differential geometry)|pullback connection]] on the [[pullback bundle]] {{math|''γ'' ∗ T''M''}}. However, in a [[local trivialization]] it is a first-order system of [[linear differential equation|linear ordinary differential equations]], which has a unique solution for any initial condition given by the second condition (for instance, by the [[Picard–Lindelöf theorem]]).

Thus parallel transport provides a way of moving tangent vectors along a curve using the affine connection to keep them "pointing in the same direction" in an intuitive sense, and this provides a [[linear isomorphism]] between the tangent spaces at the two ends of the curve. The isomorphism obtained in this way will in general depend on the choice of the curve: if it does not, then parallel transport along every curve can be used to define parallel vector fields on {{mvar|M}}, which can only happen if the curvature of {{math|∇}} is zero.

A linear isomorphism is determined by its action on an [[Basis (linear algebra)#Ordered bases and coordinates|ordered basis]] or '''frame'''. Hence parallel transport can also be characterized as a way of transporting elements of the (tangent) [[frame bundle]] {{math|GL(''M'')}} along a curve. In other words, the affine connection provides a '''lift''' of any curve {{mvar|γ}} in {{mvar|M}} to a curve {{mvar|γ&amp;#x303;}} in {{math|GL(''M'')}}.

==Formal definition on the frame bundle==
{{see also|connection (principal bundle)}}

An affine connection may also be defined as a [[connection (principal bundle)|principal {{math|GL(''n'')}} connection]] {{mvar|ω}} on the [[frame bundle]] {{math|F''M''}} or {{math|GL(''M'')}} of a manifold {{mvar|M}}. In more detail, {{mvar|ω}} is a smooth map from the tangent bundle {{math|T(F''M'')}} of the frame bundle to the space of {{math|''n'' × ''n''}} matrices (which is the [[Lie algebra]] {{math|'''gl'''(''n'')}} of the [[Lie group]] {{math|GL(''n'')}} of invertible {{math|''n'' × ''n''}} matrices) satisfying two properties:
# {{mvar|ω}} is [[equivariant]] with respect to the action of {{math|GL(''n'')}} on {{math|T(F''M'')}} and {{math|'''gl'''(''n'')}};
# {{math|''ω''(''X&lt;sub&gt;ξ&lt;/sub&gt;'') {{=}} ''ξ''}} for any {{mvar|ξ}} in {{math|'''gl'''(''n'')}}, where {{mvar|X&lt;sub&gt;ξ&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the vector field on {{math|F''M''}} corresponding to {{mvar|ξ}}.

Such a connection {{mvar|ω}} immediately defines a [[covariant derivative]] not only on the tangent bundle, but on [[vector bundle]]s [[associated bundle|associated]] to any [[group representation]] of {{math|GL(''n'')}}, including bundles of [[tensor]]s and [[tensor density|tensor densities]]. Conversely, an affine connection on the tangent bundle determines an affine connection on the frame bundle, for instance, by requiring that {{mvar|ω}} vanishes on tangent vectors to the lifts of curves to the frame bundle defined by parallel transport.

The frame bundle also comes equipped with a [[frame bundle#Solder form|solder form]] {{math|''θ'' : T(F''M'') → '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} which is '''horizontal''' in the sense that it vanishes on [[vertical bundle|vertical vectors]] such as the point values of the vector fields {{mvar|X&lt;sub&gt;ξ&lt;/sub&gt;}}: indeed {{mvar|θ}} is defined first by projecting a tangent vector (to {{math|F''M''}} at a frame {{mvar|f}}) to {{mvar|M}}, then by taking the components of this tangent vector on {{mvar|M}} with respect to the frame {{mvar|f}}. Note that {{mvar|θ}} is also {{math|GL(''n'')}}-equivariant (where {{math|GL(''n'')}} acts on {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} by matrix multiplication).

The pair {{math|(''θ'', ''ω'')}} defines a [[bundle isomorphism]] of {{math|T(F''M'')}} with the trivial bundle {{math|F''M'' × '''aff'''(''n'')}}, where {{math|'''aff'''(''n'')}} is the [[Cartesian product]] of {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{math|'''gl'''(''n'')}} (viewed as the Lie algebra of the affine group, which is actually a [[semidirect product]] – see below).

==Affine connections as Cartan connections==
{{see also|Cartan connection}}

Affine connections can be defined within Cartan's general framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cartan|1926}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the modern approach, this is closely related to the definition of affine connections on the frame bundle. Indeed, in one formulation, a Cartan connection is an [[absolute parallelism]] of a principal bundle satisfying suitable properties. From this point of view the {{math|'''aff'''(''n'')}}-valued one-form {{math|(''θ'', ''ω'') : T(F''M'') → '''aff'''(''n'')}} on the frame bundle (of an [[affine manifold]]) is a Cartan connection. However, Cartan's original approach was different from this in a number of ways:
* the concept of frame bundles or principal bundles did not exist;
* a connection was viewed in terms of parallel transport between infinitesimally nearby points;{{efn|It is difficult to make Cartan's intuition precise without invoking [[smooth infinitesimal analysis]], but one way is to regard his points being ''variable'', that is maps from some unseen parameter space into the manifold, which can then be differentiated.}}
* this parallel transport was affine, rather than linear;
* the objects being transported were not tangent vectors in the modern sense, but elements of an [[affine space]] with a marked point, which the Cartan connection ultimately ''identifies'' with the tangent space.

===Explanations and historical intuition===

The points just raised are easiest to explain in reverse, starting from the motivation provided by surface theory. In this situation, although the planes being rolled over the surface are tangent planes in a naive sense, the notion of a [[tangent space]] is really an [[differential (infinitesimal)|infinitesimal]] notion,{{efn|Classically, the [[tangent space]] was viewed as an infinitesimal approximation, while in modern differential geometry, tangent spaces are often defined in terms of differential objects such as derivations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kobayashi|Nomizu|1996|loc=Volume 1, sections 1.1–1.2}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} whereas the planes, as [[affine subspace]]s of {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}, are [[Infinity|infinite]] in extent. However these affine planes all have a marked point, the point of contact with the surface, and they are tangent to the surface at this point. The confusion therefore arises because an affine space with a marked point can be identified with its tangent space at that point. However, the parallel transport defined by rolling does not fix this origin: it is [[affine transformation|affine]] rather than linear; the linear parallel transport can be recovered by applying a translation.

Abstracting this idea, an affine manifold should therefore be an {{mvar|n}}-manifold {{mvar|M}} with an affine space {{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, of dimension {{mvar|n}}, ''attached'' to each {{math|''x'' ∈ ''M''}} at a marked point {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, together with a method for transporting elements of these affine spaces along any curve {{mvar|C}} in {{mvar|M}}. This method is required to satisfy several properties:
# for any two points {{math|''x'', ''y''}} on {{mvar|C}}, parallel transport is an [[affine transformation]] from {{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;}} to {{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;}};
# parallel transport is defined infinitesimally in the sense that it is differentiable at any point on {{mvar|C}} and depends only on the tangent vector to {{mvar|C}} at that point;
# the derivative of the parallel transport at {{mvar|x}} determines a [[linear isomorphism]] from {{math|T&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;''M''}} to {{math|T&lt;sub&gt;''a&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;/sub&gt;''A''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

These last two points are quite hard to make precise,&lt;ref&gt;For details, see {{Harvtxt|Ü. Lumiste|2001b}}.  The following intuitive treatment is that of {{Harvtxt|Cartan|1923}} and {{Harvtxt|Cartan|1926}}.&lt;/ref&gt; so affine connections are more often defined infinitesimally. To motivate this, it suffices to consider how affine [[frames of reference]] transform infinitesimally with respect to parallel transport. (This is the origin of Cartan's [[method of moving frames]].) An affine frame at a point consists of a list {{math|(''p'', '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,… '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, where {{math|''p'' ∈ ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;}}{{efn|This can be viewed as a choice of origin: actually it suffices to consider only the case {{math|''p'' {{=}} ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;}}; Cartan implicitly identifies this with {{mvar|x}} in {{mvar|M}}.}} and the {{math|'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} form a basis of {{math|T&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;(''A''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;)}}.  The affine connection is then given symbolically by a first order [[differential system]]

:&lt;math&gt;(*) \begin{cases}
\mathrm{d}{p} &amp;= \theta^1\mathbf{e}_1 + \cdots + \theta^n\mathbf{e}_n \\
\mathrm{d}\mathbf{e}_i &amp;= \omega^1_i\mathbf{e}_1 + \cdots + \omega^n_i\mathbf{e}_n
\end{cases} \quad i=1,2,\ldots,n&lt;/math&gt;

defined by a collection of [[differential forms|one-forms]] {{math|(''θ&amp;thinsp;&lt;sup&gt;j&lt;/sup&gt;'', ''ω&amp;thinsp;{{su|b=i|p=j}}'')}}. Geometrically, an affine frame undergoes a displacement travelling along a curve {{mvar|γ}} from {{math|''γ''(''t'')}} to {{math|''γ''(''t'' + ''δt'')}} given (approximately, or infinitesimally) by

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
p(\gamma(t+\delta t)) - p(\gamma(t)) &amp;= \left(\theta^1\left(\gamma'(t)\right)\mathbf{e}_1 + \cdots + \theta^n\left(\gamma'(t)\right)\mathbf{e}_n\right)\mathrm \delta t \\
\mathbf{e}_i(\gamma(t+\delta t)) - \mathbf{e}_i(\gamma(t)) &amp;= \left(\omega^1_i\left(\gamma'(t)\right)\mathbf{e}_1 + \cdots + \omega^n_i\left(\gamma'(t)\right) \mathbf{e}_n\right)\delta t\,.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Furthermore, the affine spaces {{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are required to be tangent to {{mvar|M}} in the informal sense that the displacement of {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;}} along {{mvar|γ}} can be identified (approximately or infinitesimally) with the tangent vector {{math|''γ''′(''t'')}} to {{mvar|γ}} at {{math|''x'' {{=}} ''γ''(''t'')}} (which is the infinitesimal displacement of {{mvar|x}}). Since
:&lt;math&gt;a_x (\gamma(t + \delta t)) - a_x (\gamma(t)) = \theta\left(\gamma'(t)\right) \delta t \,,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|θ}} is defined by {{math|''θ''(''X'') {{=}} ''θ''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''X'')'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + … +  ''θ''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;(''X'')'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, this identification is given by {{mvar|θ}}, so the requirement is that {{mvar|θ}} should be a linear isomorphism at each point.

The tangential affine space {{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is thus identified intuitively with an ''infinitesimal affine neighborhood'' of {{mvar|x}}.

The modern point of view makes all this intuition more precise using principal bundles (the essential idea is to replace a frame or a ''variable'' frame by the space of all frames and functions on this space). It also draws on the inspiration of [[Felix Klein]]'s [[Erlangen programme]],&lt;ref&gt;Cf. R. Hermann (1983), Appendix 1–3 to {{Harvtxt|Cartan|1951}}, and also {{Harvtxt|Sharpe|1997}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in which a ''geometry'' is defined to be a [[homogeneous space]]. Affine space is a geometry in this sense, and is equipped with a ''flat'' Cartan connection. Thus a general affine manifold is viewed as ''curved'' deformation of the flat model geometry of affine space.

===Affine space as the flat model geometry===

====Definition of an affine space====

Informally, an '''[[affine space]]''' is a [[vector space]] without a fixed choice of [[origin (mathematics)|origin]].  It describes the geometry of [[point (mathematics)|points]] and [[Vector (geometric)|free vectors]] in space.  As a consequence of the lack of origin, points in affine space cannot be added together as this requires a choice of origin with which to form the parallelogram law for vector addition.  However, a vector {{mvar|v}} may be added to a point {{mvar|p}} by placing the initial point of the vector at {{mvar|p}} and then transporting {{mvar|p}} to the terminal point. The operation thus described {{math|''p'' → ''p'' + ''v''}} is the '''translation''' of {{mvar|p}} along {{mvar|v}}. In technical terms, affine {{mvar|n}}-space is a set {{math|'''A'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} equipped with a [[group action|free transitive action]] of the vector group {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} on it through this operation of translation of points: {{math|'''A'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} is thus a [[principal homogeneous space]] for the vector group {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

&lt;!--More could be said here (parallel equipollence, etc.), but this discussion needs to be kept reasonably short. --&gt;
The [[general linear group]] {{math|GL(''n'')}} is the [[transformation group|group of transformations]] of {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} which preserve the ''linear structure'' of {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} in the sense that {{math|''T''(''av'' + ''bw'') {{=}} ''aT''(''v'') + ''bT''(''w'')}}.  By analogy, the '''[[affine group]]''' {{math|Aff(''n'')}} is the group of transformations of {{math|'''A'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} preserving the ''affine structure''.  Thus {{math|''φ'' ∈ Aff(''n'')}} must ''preserve translations'' in the sense that

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi(p+v)=\varphi(p)+T(v)&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|T}} is a general linear transformation. The map sending {{math|''φ'' ∈ Aff(''n'')}} to {{math|''T'' ∈ GL(''n'')}} is a [[group homomorphism]].  Its [[kernel (algebra)|kernel]] is the group of translations {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. The [[Group action#Orbits and stabilizers|stabilizer]] of any point {{mvar|p}} in {{mvar|A}} can thus be identified with {{math|GL(''n'')}} using this projection: this realises the affine group as a [[semidirect product]] of {{math|GL(''n'')}} and {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, and affine space as the [[homogeneous space]] {{math|Aff(''n'')/GL(''n'')}}.

====Affine frames and the flat affine connection====
An ''affine frame'' for {{mvar|A}} consists of a point {{math|''p'' ∈ ''A''}} and a basis {{math|('''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,… '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} of the vector space {{math|T&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;''A'' {{=}} '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. The general linear group {{math|GL(''n'')}} acts freely on the set {{math|F''A''}} of all affine frames by fixing {{mvar|p}} and transforming the basis {{math|('''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,… '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} in the usual way, and the map {{mvar|π}} sending an affine frame {{math|(''p''; '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,… '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} to {{mvar|p}} is the [[quotient map]]. Thus {{math|F''A''}} is a [[principal bundle|principal {{math|GL(''n'')}}-bundle]] over {{mvar|A}}. The action of {{math|GL(''n'')}} extends naturally to a free transitive action of the affine group {{math|Aff(''n'')}} on {{math|F''A''}}, so that {{math|F''A''}} is an {{math|Aff(''n'')}}-[[principal homogeneous space|torsor]], and the choice of a reference frame identifies {{math|F''A'' → ''A''}} with the principal bundle {{math|Aff(''n'') → Aff(''n'')/GL(''n'')}}.

On {{math|F''A''}} there is a collection of {{math|''n'' + 1}} functions defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\pi(p;\mathbf{e}_1, \dots ,\mathbf{e}_n) = p&lt;/math&gt;

(as before) and

:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_i(p;\mathbf{e}_1,\dots , \mathbf{e}_n) = \mathbf{e}_i\,.&lt;/math&gt;

After choosing a basepoint for {{mvar|A}}, these are all functions with values in {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, so it is possible to take their [[exterior derivative]]s to obtain [[differential 1-form]]s with values in {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}.  Since the functions {{mvar|ε&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} yield a basis for {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} at each point of {{math|F''A''}}, these 1-forms must be expressible as sums of the form

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\mathrm{d}\pi &amp;= \theta^1\varepsilon_1+\cdots+\theta^n\varepsilon_n\\
\mathrm{d}\varepsilon_i &amp;= \omega^1_i\varepsilon_1+\cdots+\omega^n_i\varepsilon_n
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

for some collection {{math|(''θ&amp;thinsp;&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;'', ''ω&amp;thinsp;{{su|b=j|p=k}}'')&lt;sub&gt;1 ≤ ''i'', ''j'', ''k'' ≤ ''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} of real-valued one-forms on {{math|Aff(''n'')}}.  This system of one-forms on the principal bundle {{math|F''A'' → ''A''}} defines the affine connection on {{mvar|A}}.

Taking the exterior derivative a second time, and using the fact that {{math|d&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} 0}} as well as the [[linearly independent|linear independence]] of the {{mvar|ε&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}, the following relations are obtained:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\mathrm{d}\theta^j - \sum_i\omega^j_i\wedge\theta^i &amp;=0\\
\mathrm{d}\omega^j_i - \sum_k \omega^j_k\wedge\omega^k_i &amp;=0\,.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

These are the [[Maurer–Cartan equation]]s for the Lie group {{math|Aff(''n'')}} (identified with {{math|F''A''}} by the choice of a reference frame).  Furthermore:
* the [[Pfaffian system]] {{math|''θ&amp;thinsp;&lt;sup&gt;j&lt;/sup&gt;'' {{=}} 0}} (for all {{mvar|j}}) is [[integrability condition|integrable]], and its [[integral manifold]]s are the fibres of the principal bundle {{math|Aff(''n'') → ''A''}}. 
* the Pfaffian system {{math|''ω&amp;thinsp;{{su|b=i|p=j}}'' {{=}} 0}} (for all {{math|''i'', ''j''}}) is also integrable, and its integral manifolds define parallel transport in {{math|F''A''}}.

Thus the forms {{math|(''ω&amp;thinsp;{{su|b=i|p=j}}'')}} define a flat [[connection (principal bundle)|principal connection]] on {{math|F''A'' → ''A''}}.

For a strict comparison with the motivation, one should actually define parallel transport in a principal {{math|Aff(''n'')}}-bundle over {{mvar|A}}. This can be done by [[pullback bundle|pulling back]] {{math|F''A''}} by the smooth map {{math|''φ'' : '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; × ''A'' → ''A''}} defined by translation. Then the composite {{math|''φ''′ ∗ F''A'' → F''A'' → ''A''}} is a principal {{math|Aff(''n'')}}-bundle over {{mvar|A}}, and the forms {{math|(''θ&amp;thinsp;&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;'', ''ω&amp;thinsp;{{su|b=j|p=k}}'')}} [[pullback (differential geometry)|pull back]] to give a flat principal {{math|Aff(''n'')}}-connection on this bundle.

===General affine geometries: formal definitions===

An affine space, as with essentially any smooth [[Klein geometry]], is a manifold equipped with a flat Cartan connection. More general affine manifolds or affine geometries are obtained easily by dropping the flatness condition expressed by the Maurer-Cartan equations. There are several ways to approach the definition and two will be given. Both definitions are facilitated by the realisation that 1-forms  {{math|(''θ&amp;thinsp;&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;'', ''ω&amp;thinsp;{{su|b=j|p=k}}'')}} in the flat model fit together to give a 1-form with values in the Lie algebra {{math|'''aff'''(''n'')}} of the affine group {{math|Aff(''n'')}}.

In these definitions, {{mvar|M}} is a smooth {{mvar|n}}-manifold and {{math|''A'' {{=}} Aff(''n'')/GL(''n'')}} is an affine space of the same dimension.

====Definition via absolute parallelism====

Let {{mvar|M}} be a manifold, and {{mvar|P}} a principal {{math|GL(''n'')}}-bundle over {{mvar|M}}. Then an '''affine connection''' is a 1-form {{mvar|η}} on {{mvar|P}} with values in {{math|'''aff'''(''n'')}} satisfying the following properties
# {{mvar|η}} is equivariant with respect to the action of {{math|GL(''n'')}} on {{mvar|P}} and {{math|'''aff'''(''n'')}};
# {{math|''η''(''X&lt;sub&gt;ξ&lt;/sub&gt;'') {{=}} ''ξ''}} for all {{mvar|ξ}} in the Lie algebra {{math|'''gl'''(''n'')}} of all {{math|''n'' × ''n''}} matrices;
# {{mvar|η}} is a linear isomorphism of each tangent space of {{mvar|P}} with {{math|'''aff'''(''n'')}}.
The last condition means that {{mvar|η}} is an '''[[absolute parallelism]]''' on {{mvar|P}}, i.e., it identifies the tangent bundle of {{mvar|P}} with a trivial bundle (in this case {{math|''P'' × '''aff'''(''n'')}}). The pair {{math|(''P'', ''η'')}} defines the structure of an '''affine geometry''' on {{mvar|M}}, making it into an '''affine manifold'''.

The affine Lie algebra {{math|'''aff'''(''n'')}} splits as a semidirect product of {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{math|'''gl'''(''n'')}} and so {{mvar|η}} may be written as a pair {{math|(''θ'', ''ω'')}} where {{mvar|θ}} takes values in {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{mvar|ω}} takes values in {{math|'''gl'''(''n'')}}. Conditions 1 and 2 are equivalent to {{mvar|ω}} being a principal {{math|GL(''n'')}}-connection and {{mvar|θ}} being a horizontal equivariant 1-form, which induces a [[bundle homomorphism]] from {{math|T''M''}} to the [[associated bundle]] {{math|''P'' ×&lt;sub&gt;GL(''n'')&lt;/sub&gt; '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Condition 3 is equivalent to the fact that this bundle homomorphism is an isomorphism. (However, this decomposition is a consequence of the rather special structure of the affine group.) Since {{mvar|P}} is the [[frame bundle]] of {{math|''P'' ×&lt;sub&gt;GL(''n'')&lt;/sub&gt; '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, it follows that {{mvar|θ}} provides a bundle isomorphism between {{mvar|P}} and the frame bundle {{math|F''M''}} of {{mvar|M}}; this recovers the definition of an affine connection as a principal {{math|GL(''n'')}}-connection on {{math|F''M''}}.

The 1-forms arising in the flat model are just the components of {{mvar|θ}} and {{mvar|ω}}.

====Definition as a principal affine connection====
An '''affine connection''' on {{mvar|M}} is a principal {{math|Aff(''n'')}}-bundle {{mvar|Q}} over {{mvar|M}}, together with a principal {{math|GL(''n'')}}-subbundle {{mvar|P}} of {{mvar|Q}} and a principal {{math|Aff(''n'')}}-connection {{mvar|α}} (a 1-form on {{mvar|Q}} with values in {{math|'''aff'''(''n'')}}) which satisfies the following (generic) ''Cartan condition''. The {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} component of pullback of {{mvar|α}} to {{mvar|P}} is a horizontal equivariant 1-form and so defines a bundle homomorphism from {{math|T''M''}} to {{math|''P'' ×&lt;sub&gt;GL(''n'')&lt;/sub&gt; '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}: this is required to be an isomorphism.

====Relation to the motivation====
Since {{math|Aff(''n'')}} acts on {{mvar|A}}, there is, associated to the principal bundle {{mvar|Q}}, a bundle {{math|'''''A''''' {{=}} ''Q'' ×&lt;sub&gt;Aff(''n'')&lt;/sub&gt; ''A''}}, which is a fiber bundle over {{mvar|M}} whose fiber at {{mvar|x}} in {{mvar|M}} is an affine space {{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. A [[section (fiber bundle)|section]] {{mvar|a}} of {{mvar|'''A'''}} (defining a marked point {{mvar|''a''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;}} in {{mvar|''A''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;}} for each {{mvar|''x'' ∈ ''M''}}) determines a principal {{math|GL(''n'')}}-subbundle {{mvar|P}} of {{mvar|Q}} (as the bundle of stabilizers of these marked points) and vice versa. The principal connection {{mvar|α}} defines an [[Ehresmann connection]] on this bundle, hence a notion of parallel transport. The Cartan condition ensures that the distinguished section {{mvar|a}} always moves under parallel transport.

==Further properties==

===Curvature and torsion===

Curvature and torsion are the main invariants of an affine connection. As there are many equivalent ways to define the notion of an affine connection, so there are many different ways to define curvature and torsion.

From the Cartan connection point of view, the curvature is the failure of the affine connection {{mvar|η}} to satisfy the Maurer–Cartan equation

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}\eta + \tfrac12[\eta\wedge\eta] = 0,&lt;/math&gt;

where the second term on the left hand side is the [[wedge product]] using the [[Lie bracket of vector fields|Lie bracket]] in {{math|'''aff'''(''n'')}} to contract the values. By expanding {{mvar|η}} into the pair {{math|(''θ'', ''ω'')}} and using the structure of the Lie algebra {{math|'''aff'''(''n'')}}, this left hand side can be expanded into the two formulae

:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{d}\theta + \omega\wedge\theta \quad \text{and} \quad \mathrm{d}\omega + \omega\wedge\omega\,,&lt;/math&gt;

where the wedge products are evaluated using matrix multiplication. The first expression is called the [[torsion tensor|torsion]] of the connection, and the second is also called the curvature.

These expressions are differential 2-forms on the total space of a frame bundle. However, they are horizontal and equivariant, and hence define tensorial objects. These can be defined directly from the induced covariant derivative {{math|∇}} on {{math|T''M''}} as follows.

The [[Torsion of connection|torsion]] is given by the formula

:&lt;math&gt;T^\nabla(X,Y) = \nabla_X Y - \nabla_Y X - [X,Y].&lt;/math&gt;

If the torsion vanishes, the connection is said to be ''torsion-free'' or ''symmetric''.

The curvature is given by the formula

:&lt;math&gt;R^\nabla_{X,Y}Z = \nabla_X\nabla_Y Z - \nabla_Y\nabla_X Z - \nabla_{[X,Y]}Z.&lt;/math&gt;

Note that {{math|[''X'', ''Y'']}} is the [[Lie bracket of vector fields]]

:&lt;math&gt;[X,Y]=\left(X^j \partial_j Y^i - Y^j \partial_j X^i\right)\partial_i&lt;/math&gt;

in [[Einstein notation]]. This is independent of coordinate system choice and

: &lt;math&gt;\partial_i = \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial\xi^i}\right)_p\,,&lt;/math&gt;

the tangent vector at point {{mvar|p}} of the {{mvar|i}}th [[coordinate curve]]. The {{math|∂&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are a natural basis for the tangent space at point {{mvar|p}}, and the {{mvar|X&amp;thinsp;&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;}} the corresponding coordinates for the vector field {{math|''X'' {{=}} ''X&amp;thinsp;&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;'' ∂&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

When both curvature and torsion vanish, the connection defines a [[pre-Lie algebra]] structure on the space of global sections of the tangent bundle.

===The Levi-Civita connection===
If {{math|(''M'', ''g'')}} is a [[Riemannian manifold]] then there is a unique affine connection {{math|∇}} on {{mvar|M}} with the following two properties:
* the connection is torsion-free, i.e., {{math|''T''&lt;sup&gt;∇&lt;/sup&gt;}} is zero;
* parallel transport is an isometry, i.e., the inner products (defined using {{mvar|g}}) between tangent vectors are preserved.
This connection is called the '''[[Levi-Civita connection]]'''.

The second condition means that the connection is a '''[[metric connection]]''' in the sense that the Riemannian metric {{mvar|g}} is parallel: {{math|∇''g'' {{=}} 0}}. In local coordinates the components of the connection form are called [[Christoffel symbols]]: because of the uniqueness of the Levi-Civita connection, there is a formula for these components in terms of the components of {{mvar|g}}.

===Geodesics===
Since straight lines are a concept in affine geometry, affine connections define a generalized notion of (parametrized) straight lines on any affine manifold, called affine geodesics.  Abstractly, a parametric curve {{math|''γ'' : ''I'' → ''M''}} is a straight line if its tangent vector remains parallel and equipollent with itself when it is transported along {{mvar|γ}}.  From the linear point of view, an affine connection {{mvar|M}} distinguishes the affine geodesics in the following way: a smooth curve {{math|''γ'' : ''I'' → ''M''}} is an '''affine geodesic''' if {{mvar|γ&amp;#x307;}} is parallel transported along {{mvar|γ}}, that is
:&lt;math&gt;\tau_t^s\dot\gamma(s) = \dot\gamma(t)&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''τ{{su|b=t|p=s}}'' : T''&lt;sub&gt;γ&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;M'' → T''&lt;sub&gt;γ&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;M''}} is the parallel transport map defining the connection.

In terms of the infinitesimal connection {{math|∇}}, the derivative of this equation implies
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla_{\dot\gamma(t)}\dot\gamma(t) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
for all {{math|''t'' ∈ ''I''}}.

Conversely, any solution of this differential equation yields a curve whose tangent vector is parallel transported along the curve.  For every {{math|''x'' ∈ ''M''}} and every {{math|''X'' ∈ T&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;''M''}}, there exists a unique affine geodesic {{math|''γ'' : ''I'' → ''M''}} with {{math|''γ''(0) {{=}} ''x''}} and {{math|''γ&amp;#x307;''(0) {{=}} ''X''}} and where {{mvar|I}} is the maximal open interval in {{math|'''R'''}}, containing 0, on which the geodesic is defined. This follows from the [[Picard–Lindelöf theorem]], and allows for the definition of an [[exponential map (Riemannian geometry)|exponential map]] associated to the affine connection.

In particular, when {{mvar|M}} is a ([[pseudo-Riemannian manifold|pseudo]]-)[[Riemannian manifold]] and {{math|∇}} is the [[Levi-Civita connection]], then the affine geodesic are the usual [[geodesic]]s of Riemannian geometry and are the locally distance minimizing curves.

The geodesics defined here are sometimes called '''affinely parametrized''', since a given straight line in {{mvar|M}} determines a parametric curve {{mvar|γ}} through the line up to a choice of affine reparametrization {{math|''γ''(''t'') → ''γ''(''at'' + ''b'')}}, where {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} are constants.  The tangent vector to an affine geodesic is parallel and equipollent along itself.  An unparametrized geodesic, or one which is merely parallel along itself without necessarily being equipollent, need only satisfy

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla_{\dot{\gamma}}\dot{\gamma} = k\dot{\gamma}&lt;/math&gt;

for some function {{mvar|k}} defined along {{mvar|γ}}. Unparametrized geodesics are often studied from the point of view of [[projective connection]]s.

===Development===
&lt;!--Ok, so here's one reason to work on the logical distinction between the linear and affine tangent spaces.--&gt;
An affine connection defines a notion of '''[[development (differential geometry)|development]]''' of curves.  Intuitively, development captures the notion that if {{mvar|x&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a curve in {{mvar|M}}, then the affine tangent space at {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} may be ''rolled'' along the curve.  As it does so, the marked point of contact between the tangent space and the manifold traces out a curve {{mvar|C&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;}} in this affine space: the development of {{mvar|x&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

In formal terms, let {{math|''τ''{{su|b=''t''|p=0}} : T''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;M'' → T&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;''M''}} be the linear parallel transport map associated to the affine connection.  Then the development {{mvar|C&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the curve in {{math|T&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;''M''}} starts off at 0 and is parallel to the tangent of {{mvar|x&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;}} for all time {{mvar|t}}:
:&lt;math&gt;\dot{C}_t = \tau_t^0\dot{x}_t\,,\quad C_0 = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

In particular, {{mvar|x&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a ''geodesic'' if and only if its development is an affinely parametrized straight line in {{math|T&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;''M''}}.&lt;ref&gt;This treatment of development is from {{Harvtxt|Kobayashi|Nomizu|1996|loc=Volume 1, Proposition III.3.1}}; see section III.3 for a more geometrical treatment.  See also {{Harvtxt|Sharpe|1997}} for a thorough discussion of development in other geometrical situations.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Surface theory revisited==
If {{mvar|M}} is a surface in {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}, it is easy to see that {{mvar|M}} has a natural affine connection. From the linear connection point of view, the covariant derivative of a vector field is defined by differentiating the vector field, viewed as a map from {{mvar|M}} to {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}, and then projecting the result orthogonally back onto the tangent spaces of {{mvar|M}}. It is easy to see that this affine connection is torsion-free. Furthermore, it is a metric connection with respect to the Riemannian metric on {{mvar|M}} induced by the inner product on {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}, hence it is the Levi-Civita connection of this metric.

===Example: the unit sphere in Euclidean space===
Let {{math|⟨ , ⟩}} be the usual [[scalar product]] on {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}, and let {{math|'''S'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} be the unit sphere. The tangent space to {{math|'''S'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} at a point {{mvar|x}} is naturally identified with the vector subspace of {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} consisting of all vectors orthogonal to {{mvar|x}}. It follows that a vector field {{mvar|Y}} on {{math|'''S'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} can be seen as a map {{math|''Y'' : '''S'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; → '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} which satisfies

: &lt;math&gt;\langle Y_x, x\rangle = 0\,, \quad \forall x\in \mathbf{S}^2.&lt;/math&gt;

Denote as {{math|d''Y''}} the differential (Jacobian matrix) of such a map. Then we have:

:'''Lemma'''. The formula
::&lt;math&gt;(\nabla_Z Y)_x = \mathrm{d}Y_x(Z_x) + \langle Z_x,Y_x\rangle x&lt;/math&gt;
:defines an affine connection on {{math|'''S'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} with vanishing torsion.

:::'''Proof'''. It is straightforward to prove that {{math|∇}} satisfies the Leibniz identity and is {{math|''C''&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;('''S'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}} linear in the first variable. So all that needs to be proved here is that the map above does indeed define a tangent vector field. That is, we need to prove that for all {{mvar|x}} in {{math|'''S'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}
::::&lt;math&gt;\bigl\langle(\nabla_Z Y)_x,x\bigr\rangle = 0\,.\qquad \text{(Eq.1)}&lt;/math&gt;

:::Consider the map
::::&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} f: \mathbf{S}^2&amp;\to \mathbf{R}\\ x &amp;\mapsto \langle Y_x, x\rangle\,.\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

:::The map ''f'' is constant, hence its differential vanishes. In particular
::::&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}f_x(Z_x) = \bigl\langle (\mathrm{d} Y)_x(Z_x),x(\gamma'(t))\bigr\rangle + \langle Y_x, Z_x\rangle = 0\,.&lt;/math&gt;

:::Equation 1 above follows. [[Q.E.D.]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3714">In [[physics]] and [[applied mathematics]], '''analytical regularization''' is a technique used to convert [[boundary value problem]]s which can be written as [[Fredholm integral equation]]s of the first kind involving [[singular integral operator|singular operators]] into equivalent Fredholm integral equations of the second kind. The latter may be easier to solve analytically and can be studied with [[discretization]] schemes like the [[finite element method]] or the [[finite difference method]] because they are [[pointwise convergence|pointwise convergent]]. In [[computational electromagnetics]], it is known as the '''method of analytical regularization'''. It was first used in mathematics during the development of [[operator theory]] before acquiring a name.&lt;ref name=nosich&gt;Nosich, Alexander I. 'The Method of Analytic Regularization in Wave-Scattering and Eigenvalue Problems: Foundations and Review of Solutions' ''IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine''. Vol 41, No. 3. June 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

== Method ==

Analytical regularization proceeds as follows. First, the boundary value problem is formulated as an integral equation. Written as an operator equation, this will take the form
:&lt;math&gt; G X= Y &lt;/math&gt;
with &lt;math&gt; Y &lt;/math&gt; representing boundary conditions and [[Inhomogeneous differential equation|inhomogeneities]], &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; representing the field of interest, and &lt;math&gt; G &lt;/math&gt; the integral operator describing how Y is given from X based on the physics of the problem.  
Next, &lt;math&gt; G &lt;/math&gt; is split into  &lt;math&gt;G_1 + G_2&lt;/math&gt;, where  &lt;math&gt;G_1&lt;/math&gt; is invertible and contains all the singularities of &lt;math&gt;G &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; G_2&lt;/math&gt; is regular. After splitting the operator and multiplying by the inverse of  &lt;math&gt; G_1 &lt;/math&gt;, the equation becomes
:&lt;math&gt; X + G_1^{-1}  G_2 X=  G_1^{-1} Y &lt;/math&gt;
or 
:&lt;math&gt; X + A X =  B &lt;/math&gt;
which is now a Fredholm equation of the second type because by construction &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt; is [[compact operator|compact]] on the [[Hilbert space]] of which &lt;math&gt; B &lt;/math&gt; is a member.

In general, several choices for &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{G}_1&lt;/math&gt; will be possible for each problem.&lt;ref name=nosich /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6803">In the [[philosophy of mathematics]], '''Benacerraf's identification problem''' is a [[philosophical argument]], developed by [[Paul Benacerraf]], against [[set-theoretic Platonism]].&lt;ref name= "What Numbers Could Not Be"&gt;Paul Benacerraf (1965), “What Numbers Could Not Be”, ''Philosophical Review'' Vol. 74, pp. 47–73.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1965, Benacerraf published a [[Paradigm shift|paradigm changing]] article entitled "What Numbers Could Not Be".&lt;ref name= "What Numbers Could Not Be" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bob Hale and Crispin Wright (2002) [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.693.9943&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf "Benacerraf's Dilemma Revisited"] ''European Journal of Philosophy'', '''10'''(1).&lt;/ref&gt;  Historically, the work became a significant catalyst in motivating the development of [[Structuralism (philosophy of mathematics)|mathematical structuralism]].&lt;ref&gt;Stewart Shapiro (1997) ''Philosophy of Mathematics: Structure and Ontology'' New York: Oxford University Press, p. 37. {{ISBN|0195139305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The identification problem argues that there exists a fundamental problem in [[Reductionism|reducing]] [[natural numbers]] to [[pure sets]].  Since there exists an [[Infinity|infinite]] number of ways of identifying the natural numbers with pure sets, no particular set-theoretic method can be determined as the "true" reduction.  Benacerraf infers that any attempt to make such a choice of reduction immediately results in generating a meta-level, set-theoretic falsehood, namely in relation to other [[Elementarily equivalent|elementarily-equivalent]] set-theories not [[Law of identity|identical]] to the one chosen.&lt;ref name= "What Numbers Could Not Be" /&gt;  The identification problem argues that this creates a fundamental problem for Platonism, which maintains that mathematical objects have a real, abstract existence.  '''Benacerraf's dilemma'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; to Platonic set-theory is arguing that the Platonic attempt to identify the "true" reduction of natural numbers to pure sets, as revealing the [[intrinsic properties]] of these abstract mathematical objects, is impossible.&lt;ref name= "What Numbers Could Not Be" /&gt;  As a result, the identification problem ultimately argues that the relation of set theory to natural numbers cannot have an [[Ontology|ontologically]] Platonic nature.&lt;ref name= "What Numbers Could Not Be" /&gt;

== Historical motivations ==

The historical motivation for the development of Benacerraf's identification problem derives from a fundamental problem of ontology.  Since [[Medieval philosophy|Medieval]] times, philosophers have argued as to whether the ontology of mathematics contains [[abstract objects]].  In the philosophy of mathematics, an abstract object is traditionally defined as an entity that: (1) exists independent of the mind; (2) exists independent of the empirical world; and (3) has eternal, unchangeable properties.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Loux (2006) ''Metaphysics: A Contemporary Introduction'' (Routledge Contemporary Introductions to Philosophy), London: Routledge. {{ISBN|0415401348}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Traditional mathematical Platonism maintains that some set of mathematical elements–[[natural numbers]], [[real numbers]], [[Functions (mathematics)|functions]], [[Relation (mathematics)|relations]], [[systems]]–are such abstract objects.  Contrarily, mathematical [[nominalism]] denies the existence of any such abstract objects in the ontology of mathematics.  
   
In the late 19th and early 20th century, a number of anti-Platonist programs gained in popularity.  These included [[intuitionism]], [[Formalism (mathematics)|formalism]], and [[predicativism]].  By the mid-20th century, however, these anti-Platonist theories had a number of their own issues.  This subsequently resulted in a resurgence of interest in Platonism.  It was in this historic context that the motivations for the identification problem developed.

== Description ==

The identification problem begins by evidencing some set of elementarily-equivalent, set-theoretic models of the natural numbers.&lt;ref name= "What Numbers Could Not Be" /&gt;  Benacerraf considers two such set-theoretic methods:

::'''Set-theoretic method I''' (using [[Zermelo ordinals]])
::0 = ∅
::1 = {{mset|∅}}
::2 = {{mset|{{mset|∅}}}}
::3 = {{mset|{{mset|{{mset|∅}}}}}}
::...

::'''Set-theoretic method II''' (using [[von Neumann ordinals]])
::0 = ∅
::1 = {{mset|∅}}
::2 = {{mset|∅, {{mset|∅}}}}
::3 = {{mset|∅, {{mset|∅}}, {{mset|∅, {{mset|∅}}}}}}
::...

As Benacerraf demonstrates, both method I and II reduce natural numbers to sets.&lt;ref name= "What Numbers Could Not Be" /&gt;  Benacerraf formulates the dilemma as a question: which of these set-theoretic methods uniquely provides the true identity statements, which elucidates the true ontological nature of the natural numbers?&lt;ref name= "What Numbers Could Not Be" /&gt;  Either method I or II could be used to define the natural numbers and subsequently generate true arithmetical statements to form a mathematical system.  In their relation, the elements of such mathematical systems are [[isomorphic]] in their structure.  However, the problem arises when these isomorphic structures are related together on the meta-level.  The definitions and arithmetical statements from system I are not identical to the definitions and arithmetical statements from system II.  For example, the two systems differ in their answer to whether 0 ∈ 2, insofar as ∅ is not an element of {{mset|{{mset|∅}}}}.  Thus, in terms of failing the [[transitivity of identity]], the search for true identity statements similarly fails.&lt;ref name= "What Numbers Could Not Be" /&gt; By attempting to reduce the natural numbers to sets, this renders a set-theoretic falsehood between the isomorphic structures of different mathematical systems.  This is the essence of the identification problem.

According to Benacerraf, the philosophical ramifications of this identification problem result in Platonic approaches failing the ontological test.&lt;ref name= "What Numbers Could Not Be" /&gt;  The argument is used to demonstrate the impossibility for Platonism to reduce numbers to sets that reveals the existence of abstract objects.

Arkhipov.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aaronson|first1=Scott|last2=Arkhipov|first2=Alex|title=The computational complexity of linear optics|journal=Theory of Computing|date=2013|volume=9|pages=143–252|doi=10.4086/toc.2013.v009a004|url=http://www.theoryofcomputing.org/articles/v009a004/}}&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of [[Sampling statistics|sampling]] from the [[probability distribution]] of identical [[boson]]s scattered by a linear [[interferometer]]. Although the problem is well defined for any bosonic particles, its  [[photon]]ic version is currently considered as the most promising platform for a scalable implementation of a boson sampling device, which makes it a non-universal approach to [[linear optical quantum computing]]. Moreover, while not universal, the boson sampling scheme is strongly believed to implement a classically hard task using far fewer physical resources than a full linear-optical quantum computing setup. This makes it an outstanding candidate for demonstrating the power of [[quantum computation]] in the near term.

==The task==
Consider a multimode linear-optical circuit of ''N'' modes that is injected with ''M'' indistinguishable single photons (''N&gt;M''). Then, the photonic implementation of the boson sampling task consists of generating a sample from the probability distribution of single-photon measurements at the output of the circuit. Specifically, this requires reliable sources of single photons (currently the most widely used ones are [[parametric down-conversion]] crystals), as well as a linear interferometer. The latter can be fabricated, e.g., with fused-fiber beam splitters,&lt;ref name="Broome2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Broome|first1=Matthew|last2=Fedrizzi|first2=Alessandro|last3=Rahimi-Keshari|first3=Saleh|last4=Dove|first4=Justin|last5=Aaronson|first5=Scott|last6=Ralph|first6=Timothy|last7=White|first7=Andrew|title=Photonic boson sampling in a tunable circuit|journal=Science|date=2013|volume=339|issue=6121|pages=794–798|doi=10.1126/science.1231440|arxiv = 1212.2234 |bibcode = 2013Sci...339..794B|pmid=23258411}}&lt;/ref&gt; through silica-on-silicon&lt;ref name="Spring2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Spring|first1=Justin|last2=Metcalf|first2=Benjamin|last3=Humphreys|first3=Peter|last4=Kolthammer|first4=Steven|last5=Jin|first5=Xian-Min|last6=Barbieri|first6=Marco|last7=Datta|first7=Animesh|last8=Thomas-Peter|first8=Nicholas|last9=Langford|first9=Nathan|last10=Kundys|first10=Dmytro|last11=Gates|first11=James|last12=Smith|first12=Brian|last13=Smith|first13=Peter|last14=Walmsley|first14=Ian|title=Boson sampling on a photonic chip|journal=Science|date=2013|volume=339|issue=6121|pages=798–801|doi=10.1126/science.1231692|arxiv = 1212.2622 |bibcode = 2013Sci...339..798S|pmid=23258407}}&lt;/ref&gt; or laser-written&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Szameit|first1=Alexander|last2=Dreisow|first2=Felix|last3=Pertsch|first3=Thomas|last4=Nolte|first4=Stefan|last5=Tünnermann|first5=Andreas|title=Control of directional evanescent coupling in fs laser written waveguides|journal=Optics Express|date=2007|volume=15|issue=4|pages=1579–1587|doi=10.1364/OE.15.001579|url=https://www.osapublishing.org/oe/abstract.cfm?uri=oe-15-4-1579|bibcode = 2007OExpr..15.1579S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tillmann2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tillmann|first1=Max|last2=Dakic|first2=Borivoje|last3=Heilmann|first3=Rene|last4=Nolte|first4=Stefan|last5=Szameit|first5=Alexander|last6=Walther|first6=Philip|title=Experimental boson sampling|journal=Nature Photonics|date=2013|volume=7|issue=7|pages=540–544|doi=10.1038/nphoton.2013.102|arxiv = 1212.2240 |bibcode = 2013NaPho...7..540T }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Crespi2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crespi|first1=Andrea|last2=Osellame|first2=Roberto|last3=Ramponi|first3=Roberta|last4=Brod|first4=Daniel|last5=Galvao|first5=Ernesto|last6=Spagnolo|first6=Nicolò|last7=Vitelli|first7=Chiara|last8=Maiorino|first8=Enrico|last9=Mataloni|first9=Paolo|last10=Sciarrino|first10=Fabio|title=Integrated multimode interferometers with arbitrary designs for photonic boson sampling|journal=Nature Photonics|date=2013|volume=7|issue=7|pages=545–549|doi=10.1038/nphoton.2013.112|arxiv = 1212.2783 |bibcode = 2013NaPho...7..545C }}&lt;/ref&gt; integrated interferometers, or electrically and optically interfaced optical chips.&lt;ref name="Carolan2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carolan|first1=Jacques|last2=Harrold|first2=Christopher|last3=Sparrow|first3=Chris|title=Universal linear optics|journal=Science|date=2015|volume=349|issue=6249|pages=711–716|doi=10.1126/science.aab3642|display-authors=etal|pmid=26160375|arxiv=1505.01182}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Finally, the scheme also necessitates high efficiency single photon-counting detectors, such as those based on  [[superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors|current-biased superconducting nanowires]], which perform the measurements at the output of the circuit. Therefore, based on these three ingredients, the boson sampling setup does not require any ancillas, adaptive measurements or entangling operations, as does e.g. the [[KLM protocol|universal optical scheme by Knill, Laflamme and Milburn]] (the '''KLM''' scheme). This makes it a non-universal model of quantum computation, and reduces the amount of physical resources needed for its practical realization.

Specifically, suppose the linear interferometer is described by an ''N×N'' unitary matrix &lt;math&gt;U,&lt;/math&gt; which performs a linear transformation of the [[Creation operator|creation]] ([[Annihilation operator|annihilation]]) operators &lt;math&gt;a^\dagger_i&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;(a_i^{})&lt;/math&gt; of the circuit's input modes:

&lt;math&gt;b^\dagger_j=\sum_{i=1}^N U_{ji}a^\dagger_i
\;\;(b_j=\sum_{i=1}^N U_{ij}^\dagger a_i).&lt;/math&gt;

Here ''i'' (''j'') labels the input (output) modes, and &lt;math&gt;b^\dagger_j&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;(b_j^{})&lt;/math&gt; denotes the creation (annihilation) operators of the output modes (''i,j''=1'',..., N''). On the other hand, the interferometer characterized by the unitary &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; naturally induces the transformation &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; of its input states. Moreover, there is a [[homomorphism]] between the unitaries &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;, and the latter transformation acts on the exponentially big [[Hilbert space]] of the system: simple counting arguments show that the size of the Hilbert space corresponding to a system of ''M'' indistinguishable photons distributed among ''N'' modes is given by the [[binomial coefficient]] &lt;math&gt;\tbinom {M+N-1} {M} &lt;/math&gt; (notice that since this [[homomorphism]] exists, not all values of &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; are possible). Namely, suppose the interferometer is injected with an input state of single photons &lt;math&gt;|\psi_{\text{in}}\rangle=&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;|s_1, s_2, ..., s_N \rangle&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^{N}s_k=M&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;(s_k&lt;/math&gt; is the number of photons injected into the ''k''th mode). Then, the state &lt;math&gt;|\psi_{\text{out}}\rangle&lt;/math&gt; at

the output of the circuit can be written down as &lt;math&gt;|\psi_{\text{out}}\rangle=W |s_1, s_2, ..., s_{N} \rangle.&lt;/math&gt; A simple way to understand the [[homomorphism]] between &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; is the following :

We define the [[isomorphism]] for the basis states: &lt;math&gt;P_{|s_1, s_2, ..., s_{N} \rangle}(&lt;/math&gt;{{math|1='''x'''}}&lt;math&gt;)\equiv x^{s_1}_1{\cdot}x^{s_2}_2{\cdot\cdot\cdot}x^{s_{N}}_{N}&lt;/math&gt;,
and get the following result : &lt;math&gt;P_{{W}|s_1, s_2, ..., s_{N} \rangle}(&lt;/math&gt;{{math|1='''x'''}}&lt;math&gt;)= P_{|s_1, s_2, ..., s_{N} \rangle}(U&lt;/math&gt;{{math|1='''x'''}}&lt;math&gt;)&lt;/math&gt;

Consequently, the probability  &lt;math&gt;p(t_1, t_2, ..., t_N)&lt;/math&gt; of detecting &lt;math&gt;t_k&lt;/math&gt; photons at the ''k''th output mode is given as&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Scheel|first1=Stefan|title=Permanents in linear optical networks |journal=Acta Physica Slovaca |volume=58|issue= 5|page=675|arxiv=quant-ph/0406127|year=2008|bibcode=2004quant.ph..6127S |doi=10.2478/v10155-010-0092-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;p(t_1, t_2, ..., t_N)=|\langle t_1, t_2, ..., t_N| \psi_{\text{out}}\rangle|^2=\frac{|\text{Perm}\,U_{S,T}|^2}{t_1!\cdot\cdot\cdot t_N! s_1!\cdot\cdot\cdot s_N!}. &lt;/math&gt;

In the above expression &lt;math&gt;\text{Perm}\,U_{S,T}&lt;/math&gt; stands for the [[Permanent (mathematics)|permanent]] of the matrix &lt;math&gt;U_{S,T},&lt;/math&gt; which is obtained from the unitary &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; by repeating &lt;math&gt;s_i&lt;/math&gt; times its ''i''th column and &lt;math&gt;t_j&lt;/math&gt; times its ''j''th row. Usually, in the context of the boson sampling problem the input state is taken of a standard form, denoted as &lt;math&gt;|1_M\rangle,&lt;/math&gt; for which each of the first ''M'' modes of the interferometer is injected with a single photon. In this case the above expression reads:

&lt;math&gt;p(t_1, t_2, ..., t_N)=|\langle t_1, t_2, ..., t_N| W |1_M\rangle|^2=\frac{|\text{Perm}\,U_{T}|^2}{t_1!\cdot\cdot\cdot t_N!}, &lt;/math&gt;

where the matrix &lt;math&gt;U_{T}&lt;/math&gt; is obtained from &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; by keeping its first ''M'' columns and repeating &lt;math&gt;t_j&lt;/math&gt; times its ''j''th row. Subsequently, the task of boson sampling is to sample either exactly or approximately from the above output distribution, given the unitary &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; describing the linear-optical circuit as input. As detailed below, the appearance of the permanent in the corresponding statistics of single-photon measurements contributes to the hardness of the boson sampling problem.

==The complexity of the problem==
The main reason of the growing interest towards the model of boson sampling is that despite being non-universal it is strongly believed to perform a computational task that is intractable for a classical computer. One of the main reasons behind this is that the probability distribution, which the boson sampling device has to sample from, is related to the permanent of [[Complex number|complex]] matrices. As is known, the [[computation of the permanent]] is in the general case an extremely hard task: it falls in the [[Sharp-P hard|#P-hard]] complexity class. Moreover, its [[Polynomial-time approximation scheme|approximation to within multiplicative error]] is a [[Sharp-P hard|#P-hard]] problem as well.

Note also that all current proofs of the hardness of simulating boson sampling on a classical computer rely on the strong computational consequences that its efficient simulation by a classical algorithm would have. Namely, these proofs show that an efficient classical simulation would imply the collapse of the [[polynomial hierarchy]] to its third level, a possibility that is considered very unlikely{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} by the computer science community, due to its strong computational implications (in line with the strong implications of [[P versus NP problem|P=NP]] problem).

===Exact boson sampling===

The hardness proof of the exact boson sampling problem can be achieved following two distinct paths. Specifically, the first one uses the tools of the [[computational complexity theory]] and combines the following two facts:

# Approximating the probability &lt;math&gt;p(t_1, t_2, ..., t_N)&lt;/math&gt; of a specific measurement outcome at the output of a linear interferometer to within a multiplicative constant is a #P-hard problem (due to the complexity of the permanent)
# If a polynomial-time classical algorithm for exact boson sampling existed, then the above probability &lt;math&gt;p(t_1, t_2, ..., t_N)&lt;/math&gt; could have been approximated to within a multiplicative constant in the BPP&lt;sup&gt;NP&lt;/sup&gt;complexity class,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Polynomial-time hierarchy|url=https://complexityzoo.uwaterloo.ca|website=Complexity Zoo}}&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. within the third level of the [[polynomial hierarchy]]

When combined together these two facts along with the [[Toda's theorem]] result in the collapse of the polynomial hierarchy, which as mentioned above is highly unlikely to occur. This leads to the conclusion that there is no classical polynomial-time algorithm for the exact boson sampling problem.

On the other hand, the alternative proof is inspired by a similar result for another restricted model of quantum computation – the model of instantaneous quantum computing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bremner|first1=Michael|last2=Jozsa|first2=Richard|last3=Shepherd|first3=Dan|title=Classical simulation of commuting quantum computations implies collapse of the polynomial hierarchy|journal=Proc. Roy. Soc. A|date=2011|volume=467|issue=2126|pages=459–472|doi=10.1098/rspa.2010.0301|url=http://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/467/2126/459|arxiv = 1005.1407 |bibcode = 2011RSPSA.467..459B }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Namely, the proof uses the [[KLM protocol|KLM scheme]], which says that linear optics with adaptive measurements is universal for the class [[BQP]]. It also relies on the following facts:

# Linear optics with postselected measurements is universal for [[PostBQP]], i.e. quantum polynomial-time class with postselection (a straightforward corollary of the KLM construction)
# The class [[PostBQP]] is equivalent to [[PP (complexity class)|PP]] (i.e. the probabilistic polynomial-time class): PostBQP = PP&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aaronson|first1=Scott|title=Quantum computing, postselection, and probabilistic polynomial-time|journal=Proc. Roy. Soc. A|date=2005|volume=461|issue=2063|pages=3473–3482|doi=10.1098/rspa.2005.1546|url=http://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/461/2063/3473|bibcode = 2005RSPSA.461.3473A |arxiv=quant-ph/0412187}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The existence of a classical boson sampling algorithm implies the simulability  of postselected linear optics in the PostBPP class (that is, classical polynomial-time with postselection, known also as the class BPP&lt;sub&gt;path&lt;/sub&gt;)

Again, the combination of these three results, as in the previous case, results in the collapse of the polynomial hierarchy. This makes the existence of a classical polynomial-time algorithm for the exact boson sampling problem highly unlikely.

The best proposed classical [[algorithm]] for exact boson sampling runs in time &lt;math&gt;O(n2^n+mn^2)&lt;/math&gt; for a system with ''n'' [[photon]]s and ''m'' output modes.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{cite arxiv|last=Clifford|first=Peter|last2=Clifford|first2=Raphaël|date=2017-06-05|title=The Classical Complexity of Boson Sampling|eprint=1706.01260|class=cs.DS}}&lt;/ref&gt; This algorithm leads to an estimate of 50 [[photon]]s required to demonstrate quantum supremacy with boson sampling. There is also an [https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=BosonSampling open-source implementation] in [[R (programming language)|R]].

===Approximate boson sampling===
The above hardness proofs are not applicable to the realistic implementation of a boson sampling device, due to the imperfection of any experimental setup (including the presence of noise, decoherence, photon losses, etc.). Therefore, for practical needs one necessitates the hardness proof for the corresponding approximate task. The latter consists of sampling from a probability distribution that is &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; close to the one given by &lt;math&gt;p(t_1, t_2, ..., t_N)&lt;/math&gt;, in terms of the [[total variation distance]]. The understanding of the complexity of this problem relies then on several additional assumptions, as well as on two yet unproven conjectures.

Specifically, the proofs of the exact boson sampling problem cannot be directly applied here, since they are based on the #P-hardness of estimating the exponentially-small probability &lt;math&gt;p(t_1, t_2, ..., t_N)&lt;/math&gt; of a specific measurement outcome. Thus, if a sampler "''knew''" which &lt;math&gt;p(t_1, t_2, ..., t_N)&lt;/math&gt; we wanted to estimate, then it could adversarially choose to corrupt it (as long as the task is approximate). That is why, the idea is to "''hide''" the above probability &lt;math&gt;p(t_1, t_2, ..., t_N)&lt;/math&gt; into an ''N×N'' random unitary matrix. This can be done knowing that any ''M×M'' submatrix of a unitary &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;, randomly chosen according to the [[Haar measure]], is close in variation distance to a matrix of [[i.i.d.]] [[Complex numbers|complex]] [[Normal distribution|random Gaussian variables]], provided that ''M ≤ N''&lt;sup&gt;1/6&lt;/sup&gt; (note that Haar random matrices can be directly implemented in optical circuits by mapping independent probability density functions for their parameters, to optical circuit components, i.e., beam splitters and phase shifters&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Russell|first1=Nicholas|last2=Chakhmakhchyan|first2=Levon|last3=O'Brien|first3=Jeremy|last4=Laing|first4=Anthony|journal=New J. Phys.|title=Direct dialling of Haar random unitary matrices|date=2017|volume=19|issue=3|pages=033007|doi=10.1088/1367-2630/aa60ed|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/aa60ed/meta;jsessionid=D6322AA7517E2AB9D8BE9BC9BCE6D350.ip-10-40-1-105|bibcode=2017NJPh...19c3007R}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Therefore, if the linear optical circuit implements a Haar random unitary matrix, the adversarial sampler will not be able to detect which of the exponentially
many probabilities &lt;math&gt;p(t_1, t_2, ..., t_N)&lt;/math&gt; we care about, and thus will not be able to avoid its estimation. In this case &lt;math&gt;p(t_1, t_2, ..., t_N)&lt;/math&gt; is proportional to the squared absolute value of the permanent of the ''M×M'' matrix &lt;math&gt;X\sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1)^{M\times M}_{\mathcal{C}}&lt;/math&gt; of i.i.d. Gaussians, smuggled inside &lt;math&gt;U.&lt;/math&gt; These arguments bring us to the first conjecture of the hardness proof of approximate boson sampling problem – the permanent-of-Gaussians conjecture:
* Approximating the permanent of a matrix &lt;math&gt;X\sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1)^{M\times M}_{\mathcal{C}}&lt;/math&gt; of i.i.d. Gaussians to within multiplicative error is a #P-hard task.

Moreover, the above conjecture can be linked to the estimation of &lt;math&gt;|\text{Perm}\,X|^2,&lt;/math&gt; which the given probability of a specific measurement outcome is proportional to. However to establish this link one has to rely on another conjecture – the permanent anticoncentration conjecture:
* There exists a polynomial ''Q'' such that for any ''M'' and ''δ''&gt;0 the probability over ''M×M'' matrices &lt;math&gt;X\sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1)^{M\times M}_{\mathcal{C}}&lt;/math&gt; of the following inequality to hold is smaller than ''δ'': &lt;math&gt;|\,\text{Perm}\,X|&lt;\frac{\sqrt{M!}}{Q(M, 1/\delta)}.&lt;/math&gt;

By making use of the above two conjectures (which have several evidences of being true), the final proof eventually states that the existence of a classical polynomial-time algorithm for the approximate boson sampling task implies the collapse of the polynomial hierarchy. It is also worth mentioning another fact important to the proof of this statement, namely the so-called bosonic birthday paradox (in analogy with the well-known [[birthday paradox]]). The latter states that if ''M'' identical bosons are scattered among ''N''≫''M''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; modes of a linear interferometer with no two bosons in the same mode, then with high probability two bosons will not be found in the same output mode either.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Arkhipov|first1=Alex|last2=Kuperberg|first2=Greg|journal=Geometry &amp; Topology Monographs|title=The bosonic birthday paradox|date=2012|volume=18|pages=1–7|doi=10.2140/gtm.2012.18.1|url=http://msp.org/gtm/2012/18/p001.xhtml|series=Proceedings of the Freedman Fest|arxiv=1106.0849}}&lt;/ref&gt; This property has been experimentally observed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Spagnolo|first1=Nicolò|last2=Vitelli|first2=Chiara|last3=Sanson|first3=Linda|title=General Rules for Bosonic Bunching in Multimode Interferometers|journal=Phys.

Lett.|date=2013|volume=111|issue=13|page=130503|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.111.130503|arxiv = 1305.3188 |bibcode = 2013PhRvL.111m0503S |display-authors=etal|pmid=24116759}}&lt;/ref&gt; with two and three photons in integrated interferometers of up to 16 modes. On the one hand this feature facilitates the implementation of a restricted boson sampling device. Namely, if the probability of having more than one photon at the output of a linear optical circuit is negligible, one does not require photon-number-resolving detectors anymore: on-off detectors will be sufficient for the realization of the setup.

Although the probability &lt;math&gt;p(t_1, t_2, ..., t_N)&lt;/math&gt; of a specific measurement outcome at the output of the interferometer is related to the permanent of submatrices of a unitary matrix, a boson sampling machine does not allow its estimation. The main reason behind is that the corresponding detection probability is usually exponentially small. Thus, in order to collect enough statistics to approximate its value, one has to run the quantum experiment for exponentially long time. Therefore, the estimate obtained from a boson sampler is not more efficient that running the classical polynomial-time algorithm by Gurvits for approximating the permanent of any matrix to within additive error.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gurvits|first1=Leonid|title=On the complexity of mixed discriminants and related problems|journal=Mathematical Foundations of Computer Science|date=2005|pages=447–458}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variants==

===Scattershot boson sampling===
As already mentioned above, for the implementation of a boson sampling machine one necessitates a reliable source of many indistinguishable photons, and this requirement currently remains one of the main difficulties in scaling up the complexity of the device. Namely, despite recent advances in photon generation techniques using atoms, molecules, [[quantum dots]] and [[Nitrogen-vacancy center|color centers in diamonds]], the most widely used method remains the [[parametric down-conversion]] ('''PDC''') mechanism. The main advantages of PDC sources are the high photon indistinguishability, collection efficiency and relatively simple experimental setups. However, one of the drawbacks of this approach is its non-deterministic (heralded) nature. Specifically, suppose the probability of generating a single photon by means of a PDC crystal is ''ε''. Then, the probability of generating simultaneously ''M'' single photons is ''ε&lt;sup&gt;M&lt;/sup&gt;'', which decreases exponentially with ''M''. In other words, in order to generate the input state for the boson sampling machine, one would have to wait for exponentially long time, which would kill the advantage of the quantum setup over a classical machine. Subsequently, this characteristic restricted the use of PDC sources to proof-of-principle demonstrations of a boson sampling device.

Recently, however, a new scheme has been proposed to make the best use of PDC sources for the needs of boson sampling, greatly enhancing the rate of ''M''-photon events. This approach has been named '''scattershot boson sampling''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lund|first1=Austin|last2=Laing|first2=Anthony|last3=Rahimi-Keshari|first3=Saleh|title=Boson sampling from a Gaussian state|journal=Phys.

Then, by pumping all ''N'' PDC crystals with simultaneous laser pulses, the probability of generating ''M'' photons will be given as &lt;math&gt;\tbinom {N} {M}\varepsilon^M.&lt;/math&gt; Therefore, for  ''N''≫''M'', this results in an exponential improvement in the single photon generation rate with respect to the usual, fixed-input boson sampling with ''M'' sources. Note that this setting can also be seen as a problem of sampling ''N'' [[Squeezed coherent state|two-mode squeezed vacuum states]] generated from ''N'' PDC sources.

Scattershot boson sampling is still intractable for a classical computer: in the conventional setup we fixed the columns that defined our ''M''×''M'' submatrix and only varied the rows, whereas now we vary the columns too, depending on which ''M'' out of ''N'' PDC crystals generated single photons. Therefore, the proof can be constructed here similar to the original one. Furthermore, scattershot boson sampling has been also recently implemented with six photon-pair sources coupled to integrated photonic circuits of nine and thirteen modes, being an important leap towards a convincing experimental demonstration of the quantum computational supremacy.&lt;ref name="Bentivegna2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bentivegna|first1=Marco|last2=Spagnolo|first2=Nicolo|last3=Vitelli|first3=Chiara|last4=Flamini|first4=Fulvio|last5=Viggianiello|first5=Niko|last6=Latmiral|first6=Ludovico|last7=Mataloni|first7=Paolo|last8=Brod|first8=Daniel|last9=Galvão|first9=Ernesto|last10=Crespi|first10=Andrea|last11=Ramponi|first11=Roberta|last12=Osellame|first12=Roberto|last13=Sciarrino|first13=Fabio|title=Experimental scattershot boson sampling|journal=Science Advances|date=2015|volume=1|issue=3|page=e1400255|doi=10.1126/sciadv.1400255|arxiv = 1505.03708 |bibcode = 2015SciA....1E0255B }}&lt;/ref&gt; The scattershot boson sampling model can be further generalized to the case where both legs of PDC sources are subject to linear optical transformations (in the original scattershot case, one of the arms is used for heralding, i.e., it goes through the identity channel). Such a '''twofold''' scattershot boson sampling model is also computationally hard, as proven by making use of the symmetry of [[T-symmetry|quantum mechanics under time reversal]].&lt;ref name="Chakhmakhchyan2017"/&gt;

===Gaussian boson sampling===
Another photonic implementation of boson sampling concerns Gaussian input states, i.e. states whose quasiprobability [[Wigner distribution function]] is a Gaussian one. The hardness of the corresponding sampling task can be linked to that of scattershot boson sampling. Namely, the latter can be embedded into the conventional boson sampling setup with Gaussian inputs. For this, one has to generate two-mode entangled Gaussian states and apply a Haar-random unitary &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; to their "right halves", while doing nothing to the others. Then we can measure the "left halves" to find out which of the input states contained a photon before we applied &lt;math&gt;U.&lt;/math&gt; This is precisely equivalent to scattershot boson sampling, except for the fact that our measurement of the herald photons has been deferred till the end of the experiment, instead of happening at the beginning. Therefore, approximate Gaussian boson sampling can be argued to be hard under precisely the same complexity assumption as can approximate ordinary or scattershot boson sampling.&lt;ref name="aaronson" /&gt; Gaussian resources can be employed at the measurement stage, as well. Namely, one can define a boson sampling model, where a linear optical evolution of input single-photon states is concluded by Gaussian measurements (more specifically, by eight-port [[homodyne detection]] that projects each output mode onto a [[squeezed coherent state]]). Such a model deals with continuous-variable measurement outcome, which, under certain conditions, is a computationally hard task.&lt;ref name="Chakhmakhchyan2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chakhmakhchyan|first1=Levon|last2=Cerf|first2=Nicolas|title=Boson sampling with Gaussian measurements|journal=Phys.

This setting makes use of a set of [[Squeezed coherent state|two-mode squeezed vacuum states]] as a prior resource, with no need of single-photon sources or in-line nonlinear amplification medium&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last1=Chakhmakhchyan|first1=Levon|last2=Cerf|first2=Nicolas|title= Simulating universal Gaussian circuits with linear optics|eprint=1803.11534|year=2018|class=quant-ph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classically simulable boson sampling tasks===
The above results state that the existence of a polynomial-time classical algorithm for the original boson sampling scheme with indistinguishable single photons (in the exact and approximate cases), for scattershot, as well as for the general Gaussian boson sampling problems is highly unlikely. Nevertheless, there are some non-trivial realizations of the boson sampling problem that allow for its efficient classical simulation. One such example is when the optical circuit is injected with distinguishable single photons. In this case, instead of summing the [[Probability amplitude|probability ''amplitudes'']] corresponding to photonic many-particle paths, one has to sum the corresponding probabilities (i.e. the squared absolute values of the amplitudes). Consequently, the detection probability &lt;math&gt;p(t_1, t_2, ..., t_N)&lt;/math&gt; will be proportional to the permanent of submatrices of (component-wise) squared absolute value of the unitary &lt;math&gt;U.&lt;/math&gt; The latter is now a non-negative matrix. Therefore, although the exact computation of the corresponding permanent is a [[Sharp-P|#P-complete]] problem, its approximation can be performed efficiently on a classical computer, due the seminal algorithm by Jerrum, Sinclaire and Vigoda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jerrum|first1=Mark|last2=Sinclair|first2=Alistair|last3=Vigoda|first3=Eric|title=A polynomial-time approximation algorithm for the permanent of a matrix with nonnegative entries|journal=Journal of the ACM|date=2001|volume=51|issue=4|pages=671–697|doi=10.1145/1008731.1008738|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1008738}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In other words, approximate boson sampling with distinguishable photons is efficiently classically simulable.

Another instance of classically simulable boson sampling setups consists of sampling from the probability distribution of [[coherent states]] injected into the linear interferometer. The reason is that at the output of a linear optical circuit coherent states remain such, and do not create any [[quantum entanglement]] among the modes. More precisely, only their amplitudes are transformed, and the transformation can be efficiently calculated on a classical computer (the computation comprises [[matrix multiplication]]). This fact can be used to perform corresponding sampling tasks from another set of states: so-called classical states, whose [[Glauber-Sudarshan P-Representation|Glauber-Sudarshan ''P'' function]] is a well-defined probability distribution. These states can be represented as a mixture of coherent states due to [[Optical equivalence theorem|the optical equivalence theorem]]. Therefore, picking random coherent states distributed according to the corresponding ''P'' function, one can perform efficient classical simulation of boson sampling from this set of classical states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rahimi-Keshari|first1=Saleh|last2=Lund|first2=Austin|last3=Ralph|first3=Timothy|title=What can quantum optics say about computational complexity theory?|journal=Phys.

==Experimental implementations==

===Implementation of boson sampling===
The above requirements for the photonic boson sampling machine allow for its small-scale construction by means of existing technologies. Consequently, shortly after the theoretical model was introduced, four different groups&lt;ref name="Broome2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Spring2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tillmann2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Crespi2013" /&gt;
simultaneously reported its realization.

Specifically, this included the implementation of boson sampling with:
* two and three photons scattered by a six-mode linear unitary transformation (represented by two orthogonal polarizations in 3×3 spatial modes of a fused-fiber beam splitter) by a collaboration between the University of Queensland and MIT&lt;ref name="Broome2013" /&gt;
* three photons in different modes of a six-mode silica-on-silicon waveguide circuit, by a collaboration between Universities of Oxford, Shanghai, London and Southampton&lt;ref name="Spring2013" /&gt;
* three photons in a femtosecond laser-written five-mode interferometer, by a collaboration between universities of Vienna and Jena&lt;ref name="Tillmann2013" /&gt;
* three photons in a femtosecond laser-written five-mode interferometer implementing a Haar-random unitary transformation, by a collaboration between Milan's Institute of Photonics and Nanotechnology, Universidade Federal Fluminense and Sapienza University of Rome.&lt;ref name="Crespi2013" /&gt;

Later on, more complex boson sampling experiments have been performed, increasing the number of spatial modes of random interferometers up to 13&lt;ref name="Spagnolo2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Spagnolo|first1=Nicolo|last2=Vitelli|first2=Chiara|last3=Bentivegna|first3=Marco|last4=Brod|first4=Daniel|last5=Crespi|first5=Andrea|last6=Flamini|first6=Fulvio|last7=Giacomini|first7=Sandro|last8=Milani|first8=Giorgio|last9=Ramponi|first9=Roberta|last10=Mataloni|first10=Paolo|last11=Osellame|first11=Roberto|last12=Galvão|first12=Ernesto|last13=Sciarrino|first13=Fabio|title=Experimental validation of photonic boson sampling|journal=Nature Photonics|date=2014|volume=8|issue=8|pages=615–620|doi=10.1038/nphoton.2014.135|arxiv = 1311.1622 |bibcode = 2014NaPho...8..615S }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 9&lt;ref name="Carolan2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carolan|first1=Jacques|last2=Meinecke|first2=Jasmin|last3=Shadbolt|first3=Pete|last4=Russell|first4=Nicholas|last5=Ismail|first5=Nur|last6=Wörhoff|first6=Kerstin|last7=Rudolph|first7=Terry|last8=Thompson|first8=Mark|last9=O'Brien|first9=Jeremy|last10=Matthews|first10=Jonathan|last11=Laing|first11=Anthony|title=On the experimental verification of quantum complexity in linear optics|journal=Nature Photonics|date=2014|volume=8|issue=8|pages=621–626|doi=10.1038/nphoton.2014.152|arxiv = 1311.2913 |bibcode = 2014NaPho...8..621C }}&lt;/ref&gt; modes, and realizing a 6-mode fully reconfigurable integrated circuit.&lt;ref name="Carolan2015" /&gt;
These experiments altogether constitute the proof-of-principle demonstrations of an operational boson sampling device, and route towards its larger-scale implementations.

===Implementation of scattershot boson sampling===
A first scattershot boson sampling experiment has been recently implemented&lt;ref name="Bentivegna2015" /&gt; using six photon-pair sources coupled to integrated photonic circuits with 13 modes. The 6 photon-pair sources were obtained via [[Parametric down-conversion|type-II PDC processes]] in 3 different nonlinear crystals (exploiting the polarization degree of freedom). This allowed to sample simultaneously between 8 different input states. The 13-mode interferometer was realized by femtosecond laser-writing technique on alumino-borosilicate glass.

This experimental implementation represents a leap towards an experimental demonstration of the quantum computational supremacy.&lt;ref name="Bentivegna2015" /&gt;

===Proposals with alternative photonic platform===
There are several other proposals for the implementation of photonic boson sampling. This includes, e.g., the scheme for arbitrarily scalable boson sampling using two nested fiber loops. In this case, the architecture employs time-bin encoding, whereby the incident photons form a pulse train entering the loops. Meanwhile, dynamically controlled loop coupling ratios allow the construction of arbitrary linear interferometers. Moreover, the architecture employs only a single point of interference and may thus be easier to stabilize than other implementations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Motes|first1=Keith|last2=Gilchrist|first2=Alexei|last3=Dowling|first3=Jonathan|last4=Rohde|first4=Peter|title=Scalable boson sampling with time-bin encoding using a loop-based architecture|journal=Phys. Rev. Lett.|date=2014|volume=113|issue=12|page=120501|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.113.120501|arxiv = 1403.4007 |bibcode = 2014PhRvL.113l0501M|pmid=25279613}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another approach relies on the realization of unitary transformations on temporal modes based on dispersion and pulse shaping. Namely, passing consecutively heralded photons through time-independent dispersion and measuring the output time of the photons is equivalent to a boson sampling experiment. With time-dependent dispersion, it is also possible to implement arbitrary single-particle unitaries. This scheme requires a much smaller number of sources and detectors and do not necessitate a large system of beam splitters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pant|first1=Mihir|last2=Englund|first2=Dirk|title=High dimensional unitary transformations and boson sampling on temporal modes using dispersive optics |arxiv=1505.03103|doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.93.043803|volume=93|issue=4|pages=043803|journal=Physical Review A|bibcode = 2016PhRvA..93d3803P |year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Certification of boson sampling: theory and experiments==
The output of a [[universal quantum computer]] running, for example, [[Shor's algorithm|Shor's factoring algorithm]], can be efficiently verified classically, as is the case for all problems in
the [[NP class|non-deterministic polynomial-time]] (NP) complexity class. It is however not clear that a similar structure
exists for the boson sampling scheme. Namely, as the latter is related to the problem of estimating matrix permanents (falling into [[Sharp-P|#P-hard]] complexity class), it is not understood how to verify correct operation for large versions of the setup. Specifically, the naive verification of the output of a boson sampler by computing the corresponding measurement probabilities represents a problem intractable for a classical computer.

A first relevant question is whether it is possible or not to distinguish between uniform and boson-sampling distributions by performing a polynomial number of measurements. The initial argument introduced in Ref.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|last1=Gogolin|first1=C.|last2=Kliesch|first2=M.|last3=Aolita|first3=L.|last4=Eisert|first4=J.|title=Boson-Sampling in the light of sample complexity|eprint=1306.3995|class=quant-ph|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; stated that as long as one makes use of symmetric measurement settings the above is impossible (roughly speaking a symmetric measurement scheme does not allow for labeling the output modes of the optical circuit). However, within current technologies the assumption of a symmetric setting is not justified (the tracking of the measurement statistics is fully accessible), and therefore the above argument does not apply. It is then possible to define a rigorous and efficient test to discriminate the boson sampling statistics from an unbiased probability distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|last1=Aaronson|first1=Scott|last2=Arkhipov|first2=Alex|title=BosonSampling is far from uniform|eprint=1309.7460|class=quant-ph|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The corresponding discriminator is correlated to the permanent of the submatrix associated with a given measurement pattern, but can be efficiently calculated. This test has been applied experimentally to distinguish between a boson sampling and a uniform distribution in the 3-photon regime with integrated circuits of 5, 7, 9 and 13 modes,&lt;ref name="Spagnolo2014" /&gt; as well as 9 modes.&lt;ref name="Carolan2014" /&gt;

The test above does not distinguish between more complex distributions, such as quantum and classical, or between fermionic and bosonic statistics. A physically motivated scenario to be addressed is the unwanted introduction of distinguishability between photons, which destroys quantum interference (this regime is readily accessible experimentally, for example by introducing temporal delay between photons). The opportunity then exists to tune between ideally indistinguishable (quantum) and perfectly distinguishable (classical) data and measure the change in a suitably constructed metric. This scenario can be addressed by a statistical test which performs a one-on-one likelihood comparison of the output probabilities. This test requires the calculation of a small number of permanents, but does not need the calculation of the full expected probability distribution. Experimental implementation of the test has been successfully reported in integrated laser-written circuits for both the standard boson sampling&lt;ref name="Spagnolo2014" /&gt; (3 photons in 7-, 9- and 13-mode interferometers) and the scattershot version&lt;ref name="Bentivegna2015" /&gt; (3 photons in 9- and 13-mode interferometers with different input states). Another possibility is based on the bunching property of indinguishable photons. One can analyze the probability to find a ''k''-fold coincidence measurement outcomes (without any multiply populated input mode), which is significantly higher for distinguishable particles than for bosons due to the bunching tendency of the latters.&lt;ref name="Carolan2014" /&gt; Finally, leaving the space of random matrices one may focus on specific multimode setups with certain features. In particular, the analysis of the effect of bosonic clouding (the tendency for bosons to favor events with all particles in the same half of the output array of a continuous-time many-particle quantum walk) has been proven to discriminate the behavior of distinguishable and indistinguishable particles in this specific platform.&lt;ref name="Carolan2014" /&gt;

A different approach to confirm that the boson sampling machine behaves as the theory predicts is to make use of fully reconfigurable optical circuits. With large-scale single-photon and multiphoton interference verified with predictable multimode correlations in a fully characterized circuit, a reasonable assumption is that the system maintains correct operation as the circuit is continuously reconfigured to implement a random unitary operation. To this end, one can exploit quantum suppression laws (the probability of specific input-output combinations is suppressed when the linear interferometer is described by a [[DFT matrix|Fourier matrix]] or other matrices with relevant symmetries).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tichy|first1=Malte|last2=Mayer|first2=Klaus|last3=Buchleitner|first3=Andreas|last4=Mølmer|first4=Klaus|title=Stringent and Efficient Assessment of Boson-Sampling Devices|journal=Phys. Rev. Lett.|date=2014|volume=113|issue=2|page=020502|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.113.020502|arxiv = 1312.3080 |bibcode = 2014PhRvL.113b0502T|pmid=25062152}}&lt;/ref&gt; These suppression laws can be classically predicted in efficient ways. This approach allows also to exclude other physical models, such as mean-field states, which mimic some collective multiparticle properties (including bosonic clouding). The implementation of a Fourier matrix circuit in a fully reconfigurable 6-mode device has been reported,&lt;ref name="Carolan2015" /&gt; and experimental observations of the suppression law have been shown for 2 photons in 4- and 8-mode Fourier matrices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Crespi|first1=Andrea|last2=Osellame|first2=Roberto|last3=Ramponi|first3=Roberta|title=Quantum suppression law in a 3-D photonic chip implementing the fast Fourier transform|journal=Nature Communications|volume=7|page=10469|arxiv=1508.00782|display-authors=etal|year=2016|bibcode=2015arXiv150800782C|doi=10.1038/ncomms10469}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative implementations and applications==
Apart from the photonic realization of the boson sampling task, several other setups have been proposed. This includes, e.g., the encoding of bosons into the local transverse phonon modes of [[Ion trap|trapped ions]]. The scheme allows deterministic preparation and high-efficiency readout of the corresponding [[phonon]] [[Fock states]] and universal manipulation of the phonon modes through a combination of inherent [[Coulomb interaction]] and individual [[phase shifts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shen|first1=C.|last2=Zhang|first2=Z.|last3=Duan|first3=L.-M.|title=Scalable implementation of boson sampling with trapped ions|journal=Phys. Rev. Lett.|date=2014|volume=112|issue=5|page=050504|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.112.050504|arxiv = 1310.4860 |bibcode = 2014PhRvL.112e0504S|pmid=24580579}}&lt;/ref&gt; This scheme is scalable and relies on the recent advances in ion trapping techniques (several dozens of ions can be successfully trapped, for example, in linear Paul traps by making use of anharmonic axial potentials).

Another platform for implementing the boson sampling setup is a system of interacting spins: recent observation show that boson sampling with ''M'' particles in ''N'' modes is equivalent to the short-time evolution with ''M'' excitations in the [[Heisenberg model (quantum)|''XY'' model]] of 2''N'' spins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|last1=Peropadre|first1=Borja|last2=Aspuru-Guzik|first2=Alan|last3=Garcia-Ripoll|first3=Juan|title=Spin models and boson sampling|eprint=1509.02703|class=quant-ph|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; One necessitates several additional assumptions here, including small boson bunching probability and efficient error postselection. This scalable scheme, however, is rather promising, in the light of considerable development in the construction and manipulation of coupled  [[superconducting qubits]] and specifically the [[D-Wave Systems|D-Wave machine]].

The task of boson sampling shares peculiar similarities with the problem of determining [[Vibronic spectroscopy|molecular vibronic spectra]]: a feasible modification of the boson sampling scheme results in a setup that can be used for the reconstruction of a molecule's [[Franck–Condon principle|Franck–Condon profiles]] (for which no efficient classical algorithm is currently known). Specifically, the task now is to input specific [[Squeezed state|squeezed]] [[Coherent states|coherent]] states into a linear interferometer that is determined by the properties of the molecule of interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huh|first1=Joonsuk|last2=Giacomo Guerreschi|first2=Gian|last3=Peropadre|first3=Borja|last4=McClean|first4=Jarrod|last5=Aspuru-Guzik|first5=Alan|title=Boson sampling for molecular vibronic spectra|journal=Nature Photonics|date=2015|volume=9|issue=9|pages=615–620|doi=10.1038/NPHOTON.2015.153|arxiv = 1412.8427 |bibcode = 2015NaPho...9..615H }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, this prominent observation makes the interest towards the implementation of the boson sampling task to get spread well beyond the fundamental basis.

It has also been suggested to use a superconducting resonator network Boson Sampling device as an interferometer. This application is assumed to be practical, as small changes in the couplings between the resonators will change the sampling results. Sensing of variation in the parameters capable of altering the couplings is thus achieved, when comparing the sampling results to an unaltered reference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Goldstein |first1=Samuel |last2=Korenblit |first2=Simcha |last3=Bendor |first3=Ydan |last4=You |first4=Hao |last5=Geller |first5=Michael R. |last6=Katz |first6=Nadav |date=17 January 2017 |title=Decoherence and interferometric sensitivity of boson sampling in superconducting resonator networks |url=http://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.95.020502 |journal=Phys.

Variants of the boson sampling model have been used to construct ''classical'' computational algorithms, aimed, e.g., at the estimation of certain matrix permanents (for instance, permanents of [[Positive-definite matrix|positive-semidefinite matrices]] related to the corresponding open problem in computer science&lt;ref&gt;See open problem (4) at {{cite web|title=Shtetl Optimized: Introducing some British people to P vs. NP|url=http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=2408#comment-757410}}&lt;/ref&gt;) by combining tools proper to [[quantum optics]] and [[Time complexity|computational complexity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chakhmakhchyan|first1=Levon|last2=Cerf|first2=Nicolas|last3=Garcia-Patron|first3=Raul|title=A quantum-inspired algorithm for estimating the permanent of positive semidefinite matrices| journal = Phys.

Coarse-grained boson sampling has been proposed as a resource of decision and function problems that are computationally hard, and may thus have cryptographic applications&lt;ref&gt;Georgios M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21201">In [[harmonic analysis]] in [[mathematics]], a function of '''bounded mean oscillation''', also known as a '''BMO function''', is a [[real-valued function]] whose mean oscillation is bounded (finite). The space of functions of '''bounded mean oscillation''' ('''BMO'''), is a [[function space]] that, in some precise sense, plays the same role in the theory of [[Hardy space]]s ''H&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'' that the space ''L''&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt; of [[Essential supremum|essentially bounded function]]s plays in the theory of [[Lp space|''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''-spaces]]: it is also called '''John–Nirenberg space''', after [[Fritz John]] and [[Louis Nirenberg]] who introduced and studied it for the first time.

== Historical note ==
According to {{Harvtxt|Nirenberg|1985|p=703 and p. 707}},&lt;ref&gt;Aside with the collected papers of [[Fritz John]], a general reference for the theory of functions of bounded mean oscillation, with also many (short) historical notes, is the noted book by {{harvtxt|Stein|1993|loc=chapter IV}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the space of functions of bounded mean oscillation was introduced by {{Harvtxt|John|1961|pp=410–411}} in connection with his studies of [[Map (mathematics)|mappings]] from a [[bounded set]] {{math|Ω}} belonging to '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; into '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; and the corresponding problems arising from [[Solid mechanics|elasticity theory]], precisely from the concept of [[Deformation (mechanics)#Strain|elastic strain]]: the basic notation was introduced in a closely following paper by {{harvtxt|John|Nirenberg|1961}},&lt;ref&gt;The paper {{harv|John|1961}} just precedes the paper {{harv|John|Nirenberg|1961}} in volume 14 of the [[Communications on Pure and Applied Mathematics]].&lt;/ref&gt; where several properties of this function spaces were proved. The next important step in the development of the theory was the proof by [[Charles Fefferman]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Elias Stein]] credits only Fefferman for the discovery of this fact: see {{harv|Stein|1993|p=139}}.&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Duality (mathematics)|duality]] between '''BMO''' and the [[Hardy space]] ''H''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, in the noted paper {{Harvnb|Fefferman|Stein|1972}}: a constructive proof of this result, introducing new methods and starting a further development of the theory, was given by [[Akihito Uchiyama]].&lt;ref&gt;See his proof in the paper {{Harvnb|Uchiyama|1982}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The supremum of the mean oscillation is called the '''BMO norm''' of ''u''.&lt;ref&gt;Since, as shown in the "''[[Bounded mean oscillation#BMO is a Banach space|Basic properties]]''" section, it is exactly a [[Norm (mathematics)|norm]].&lt;/ref&gt; and is denoted by ||''u''||&lt;sub&gt;BMO&lt;/sub&gt; (and in some instances it is also denoted ||''u''||&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;).

'''Note 2'''. The use of [[cube]]s ''Q'' in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; as the [[Integration (mathematics)|integration]] [[Domain (mathematical analysis)|domains]] on which the {{EquationNote|1|mean oscillation}} is calculated, is not mandatory: {{harvtxt|Wiegerinck|2001}} uses [[Ball (mathematics)|balls]] instead and, as remarked by {{harvtxt|Stein|1993|p=140}}, in doing so a perfectly equivalent definition of [[function (mathematics)|functions]] of bounded mean oscillation arises.

===Notation===

*The universally adopted notation used for the set of BMO functions on a given domain {{math|Ω}} is '''BMO'''({{math|Ω}}): when {{math|Ω}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, '''BMO'''('''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;) simply symbolized as '''BMO'''.
*The '''BMO norm''' of  a given BMO function ''u'' is denoted by ||''u''||&lt;sub&gt;BMO&lt;/sub&gt;: in some instances, it is also denoted as ||''u''||&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;.

== Basic properties ==

===BMO functions are locally ''p''–integrable===
BMO functions are locally ''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'' if 0&amp;nbsp;&lt; ''p''&amp;nbsp;&lt; ∞, but need not be locally bounded. In fact, using the John-Nirenberg Inequality, we can prove that

:&lt;math&gt; \|u\|_{BMO}\simeq\sup_Q\left(\frac{1}{|Q|}\int_Q|u-u_Q|^pdx\right)^{1/p}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== BMO is a Banach space ===
[[Constant (mathematics)|Constant functions]] have zero mean oscillation, therefore functions differing for a constant ''c''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 can share the same BMO norm value even if their difference is not zero [[almost everywhere]]. Therefore, the function ||''u''||&lt;sub&gt;BMO&lt;/sub&gt; is properly a norm on [[quotient space (linear algebra)|quotient space]] of BMO functions [[Modulo (jargon)|modulo]] the space of [[constant function]]s on the domain considered.

===Averages of adjacent cubes are comparable===
As the name suggests, the mean or average of a function in BMO does not oscillate very much when computing it over cubes close to each other in position and scale. Precisely, if ''Q'' and ''R'' are [[dyadic cubes]] such that their boundaries touch and the side length of ''Q'' is no less than one-half the side length of ''R'' (and vice versa), then

:&lt;math&gt; |f_R-f_Q|\leq C\|f\|_{BMO}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''C'' &gt; 0 is some universal constant. This property is, in fact, equivalent to ''f'' being in BMO, that is, if ''f'' is a locally integrable function such that |''f&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;''−''f&lt;sub&gt;Q&lt;/sub&gt;''| ≤ ''C'' for all dyadic cubes ''Q'' and ''R'' adjacent in the sense described above and ''f'' is in dyadic BMO (where the supremum is only taken over dyadic cubes ''Q''), then ''f'' is in BMO&lt;ref name="Jon80"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=Peter|title=Extension Theorems for BMO|journal=Indiana University Mathematics Journal|date=1980|volume=29|issue=1|pages=41-66|doi=10.1512/iumj.1980.29.29005}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== BMO is the dual vector space of ''H''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; ===
{{harvtxt|Fefferman|1971}} showed that the BMO space is dual to ''H''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, the Hardy space with ''p''&amp;nbsp;= 1.&lt;ref&gt;See the original paper by {{harvtxt|Fefferman|Stein|1972}}, or the paper by {{Harvtxt|Uchiyama|1982}} or the comprehensive [[monograph]] of {{Harvtxt|Stein|1993|p=142}} for a proof.&lt;/ref&gt;  The pairing between ''f''&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin; ''H''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; and ''g''&amp;nbsp;∈ BMO is given by
:&lt;math&gt;(f,g)=\int_{\mathbb{R}^n}f(x)g(x) \, \mathrm{d}x&lt;/math&gt;
though some care is needed in defining this integral, as it does not in general converge absolutely.

===The John–Nirenberg Inequality===
The '''John–Nirenberg Inequality''' is an estimate that governs how far a function of bounded mean oscillation may deviate from its average by a certain amount.

====Statement====
 For each ''f''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;BMO('''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;) there are constants ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 0 , such that for any cube ''Q'' in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt; \left | \left \{x\in Q: |f-f_{Q}|&gt;\lambda \right \} \right |\leq c_{1}\exp \left (-c_2 \frac{\lambda}{\|f\|_{BMO}} \right )|Q|.&lt;/math&gt;

Conversely, if this inequality holds over all [[cube]]s with some constant ''C'' in place of ||''f''||&lt;sub&gt;BMO&lt;/sub&gt;, then ''f'' is in BMO with norm at most a constant times ''C''.

====A consequence: the distance in BMO to ''L&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;''====
The John–Nirenberg inequality can actually give more information than just the BMO norm of a function. For a locally integrable function ''f'', let ''A''(''f'') be the infimal ''A''&gt;0 for which

:&lt;math&gt;\sup_{Q\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n}\frac{1}{|Q|}\int_{Q}e^{\frac{|f-f_{Q}|}{A}}\mathrm{d}x&lt;\infty.&lt;/math&gt;

The John–Nirenberg inequality implies that ''A''(''f'')&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;C||''f''||&lt;sub&gt;BMO&lt;/sub&gt; for some universal constant ''C''. For an [[Lp space#Lp spaces|''L''&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;]] function, however, the above inequality will hold for all ''A''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0. In other words, ''A''(''f'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 if ''f'' is in L&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;. Hence the constant ''A''(''f'') gives us a way of measuring how far a function in BMO is from the subspace ''L''&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;. This statement can be made more precise:&lt;ref name="GarJon1" &gt;See the paper {{Harvnb|Garnett|Jones|1978}} for the details.&lt;/ref&gt; there is a constant ''C'', depending only on the [[Dimension (mathematics)|dimension]] ''n'', such that for any function ''f''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;BMO('''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;) the following two-sided inequality holds

:&lt;math&gt; \frac 1 C A(f) \leq \inf_{g\in L^\infty} \|f-g\|_{BMO}\leq CA(f).&lt;/math&gt;

== Generalizations and extensions ==

=== The spaces BMOH and BMOA ===

When the [[Dimension (mathematics)|dimension]] of the ambient space is 1, the space BMO can be seen as a [[linear subspace]] of [[harmonic function]]s on the [[unit disk]] and plays a major role in the theory of [[Hardy spaces]]: by using {{EquationNote|2|definition 2}}, it is possible to define the BMO(''T'') space on the [[unit circle]] as the space of [[Function (mathematics)|functions]] ''f'' : ''T'' → '''R''' such that

:&lt;math&gt; \frac 1 {|I|}\int_I|f(y)-f_I|\,\mathrm{d}y &lt; C &lt;+\infty&lt;/math&gt;

i.e. such that its {{EquationNote|1|mean oscillation}} over every arc I of the [[unit circle]]&lt;ref&gt;An arc in the [[unit circle]] ''T'' can be defined as the [[image (mathematics)|image]] of a [[interval (mathematics)|finite interval]] on the [[real line]] '''R''' under a [[continuous function]] whose [[codomain]] is ''T'' itself: a simpler, somewhat naive definition can be found in the entry "[[Arc (geometry)]]".&lt;/ref&gt; is bounded. Here as before ''f&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the mean value of f over the arc I.

{{EquationRef|3|Definition 3.}} An Analytic function on the [[unit disk]] is said to belong to the '''Harmonic BMO''' or in the '''BMOH space''' if and only if it is the [[Poisson integral]] of a BMO(''T'') function. Therefore, BMOH is the space of all functions ''u'' with the form:

:&lt;math&gt; u(a) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{\mathbf{T}}\frac{1-|a|^2}{|a-e^{i\theta}|^2} f(e^{i\theta})\,\mathrm{d}\theta&lt;/math&gt;

equipped with the norm:

:&lt;math&gt;\|u\|_{BMOH}=\sup _ {|a|&lt;1}\left\{\frac 1 {2\pi} \int_{\mathbf{T}}\frac{1-|a|^2}{|a-e^{i\theta}|^2} |f(e^{i\theta})-u(a)|\,\mathrm{d}\theta\right\}&lt;/math&gt;

The subspace of analytic functions belonging BMOH is called the '''Analytic BMO space''' or the '''BMOA space'''.

==== BMOA as the dual space of ''H''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''D'') ====
[[Charles Fefferman]] in his original work proved that the real BMO space is dual to the real valued harmonic Hardy space on the upper [[Half-space (geometry)|half-space]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; × (0, ∞].&lt;ref&gt;See the [[Bounded mean oscillation#BMO is the dual vector space of H1|section on Fefferman theorem]] of the present entry.&lt;/ref&gt; In the theory of Complex and Harmonic analysis on the unit disk, his result is stated as follows.&lt;ref&gt;See for example {{harvtxt|Girela|pp=102–103}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Let ''H&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''(''D'') be the Analytic [[Hardy space]]  on the [[unit Disc]]. For ''p''&amp;nbsp;= 1 we identify (''H''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;)* with BMOA  by pairing ''f'' ∈ ''H''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''D'') and ''g''&amp;nbsp;∈ BMOA using the ''anti-linear transformation'' ''T&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;''

:&lt;math&gt;T_g(f)=\lim_{r \rightarrow 1}\int_{-\pi}^\pi \bar{g}(e^{i\theta}) f(re^{i\theta}) \, \mathrm{d}\theta&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that although the limit always exists for an ''H''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; function f and ''T&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;'' is an element of the dual space  (''H''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;)*, since the transformation is ''anti-linear'', we don't have an isometric isomorphism between (''H''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;)* and BMOA. However one can obtain an isometry if they consider a kind of ''space of conjugate BMOA functions''.

=== The space ''VMO'' ===
The space '''VMO''' of functions of '''vanishing mean oscillation''' is the closure in BMO of the continuous functions that vanish at infinity. It can also be defined as the space of functions whose "mean oscillations" on cubes ''Q'' are not only bounded, but also tend to zero uniformly as the radius of the cube ''Q'' tends to 0 or ∞.  The space VMO is a sort of Hardy space analogue of the space of continuous functions vanishing at infinity, and in particular the real valued harmonic Hardy space ''H''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; is the dual of VMO.&lt;ref&gt;See reference {{harvnb|Stein|1993|p=180}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relation to the Hilbert transform===
A locally integrable function ''f'' on '''R''' is BMO if and only if it can be written as

:&lt;math&gt; f=f_1 + H f_2 + \alpha &lt;/math&gt;

where ''f&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' ∈ ''L''&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;, α is a constant and ''H'' is the [[Hilbert transform]].

The BMO norm is then equivalent to the infimum of &lt;math&gt; \|f_1\|_\infty + \|f_2\|_\infty&lt;/math&gt; over all such representations.

Similarly ''f'' is VMO if and only if it can be represented in the above form with ''f&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' bounded uniformly continuous functions on '''R'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Garnett|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Dyadic BMO space ===
Let ''Δ'' denote the set of [[dyadic cubes]] in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. The space '''dyadic BMO''', written BMO&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; is the space of functions satisfying the same inequality as for BMO functions, only that the supremum is over all dyadic cubes. This supremum is sometimes denoted ''||•||&lt;sub&gt;BMO&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;''.

This space properly contains BMO.  In particular, the function ''log(x)χ&lt;sub&gt;[0,∞)&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a function that is in dyadic BMO but not in BMO. However, if a function ''f'' is such that ||''f''(•−''x'')||&lt;sub&gt;BMO&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ ''C'' for all ''x'' in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; for some ''C'' &gt; 0, then by the [[one-third trick]] ''f'' is also in BMO.

Although dyadic BMO is a much narrower class than BMO, many theorems that are true for BMO are much simpler to prove for dyadic BMO, and in some cases one can recover the original BMO theorems by proving them first in the special dyadic case.&lt;ref name="GarJon2" &gt;See the reference paper by {{Harvnb|Garnett|Jones|1982}} for a comprehensive development of these themes.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Examples of BMO functions include the following:
* All bounded (measurable) functions. If ''f'' is in L&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;, then ||''f''||&lt;sub&gt;BMO&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ 2||f||&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;:&lt;ref name="S140"&gt;See reference {{harvnb|Stein|1993|p=140}}.&lt;/ref&gt; however, the converse is not true as the following example shows.
* The function log(|''P''|) for any polynomial ''P'' that is not identically zero: in particular, this is true also for |''P''(''x'')| = |''x''|.&lt;ref name="S140"/&gt;
* If ''w'' is an [[Muckenhoupt weights|''A''&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt; weight]], then log(''w'') is BMO. Conversely, if ''f'' is BMO, then ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''δf''&lt;/sup&gt; is an ''A''&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt; weight for δ&gt;0 small enough: this fact is a consequence of the [[Bounded mean oscillation#The John–Nirenberg Inequality|John–Nirenberg Inequality]].&lt;ref name="S197"&gt;See reference {{harvnb|Stein|1993|p=197}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the field of [[complex analysis]] in [[mathematics]], the '''Cauchy–Riemann equations''', named after [[Augustin Louis Cauchy|Augustin Cauchy]] and [[Bernhard Riemann]], consist of a system of two [[partial differential equation]]s which, together with certain continuity and differentiability criteria, form a necessary and sufficient condition for a [[complex function]] to be [[complex differentiable]], that is, [[holomorphic function|holomorphic]].  This system of equations first appeared in the work of [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]] {{harv|d'Alembert|1752}}. Later, [[Leonhard Euler]] connected this system to the [[analytic functions]] {{harv|Euler|1797}}. {{harvtxt|Cauchy|1814}} then used these equations to construct his theory of functions. Riemann's dissertation {{harv|Riemann|1851}} on the theory of functions appeared in 1851.

The Cauchy–Riemann equations on a pair of real-valued functions of two real variables ''u''(''x'',''y'') and ''v''(''x'',''y'') are the two equations:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
(1a)\qquad &amp; \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} \\[6pt]
(1b)\qquad &amp; \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = -\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Typically ''u'' and ''v'' are taken to be the [[real part|real]] and [[imaginary part]]s respectively of a [[complex number|complex]]-valued function of a single complex variable {{nowrap|1=''z'' = ''x'' + ''iy''}}, {{nowrap|1=''f''(''x'' + i''y'') = ''u''(''x'',''y'') + i''v''(''x'',''y'')}}.  Suppose that ''u'' and ''v'' are real-[[Differentiable function|differentiable]] at a point in an [[open subset]] of '''C ''' ('''C''' is the set of complex numbers), which can be considered as functions from '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to '''R'''.  This implies that the partial derivatives of ''u'' and ''v'' exist (although they need not be continuous) and we can approximate small variations of ''f'' linearly. Then {{nowrap|1=''f'' = ''u'' + i''v''}} is complex-[[Differentiable function|differentiable]] at that point if and only if the partial derivatives of ''u'' and ''v'' satisfy the Cauchy–Riemann equations (1a) and (1b) at that point. The sole existence of partial derivatives satisfying the Cauchy–Riemann equations is not enough to ensure complex differentiability at that point. It is necessary that u and v be real differentiable, which is a stronger condition than the existence of the partial derivatives, but in general, weaker than continuous differentiability.

[[Holomorphic function|Holomorphy]] is the property of a complex function of being differentiable at every point of an open and connected subset of '''C''' (this is called a [[Domain (mathematical analysis)|domain]] in '''C'''). Consequently, we can assert that a complex function ''f'', whose real and imaginary parts ''u'' and ''v'' are real-differentiable functions, is [[Holomorphic function|holomorphic]] if and only if, equations (1a) and (1b) are satisfied throughout the [[Domain (mathematical analysis)|domain]] we are dealing with.  [[Holomorphic functions are analytic]] and vice versa. This means that, in complex analysis, a function that is complex-differentiable in a whole domain (holomorphic) is the same as an analytic function. This is not true for real differentiable functions.

== Simple example ==
Suppose that ''z'' = ''x'' + ''iy''. The complex-valued function ''f''(''z'') = ''z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is differentiable at any point ''z'' in the complex plane. 
:&lt;math&gt;f(z)=(x + i y)^{2} = x^{2} - y^{2} + 2ixy&lt;/math&gt;
The real part ''u''(''x'', ''y'') and the imaginary part ''v''(''x'', ''y'') of ''f''(''z'') are
:&lt;math&gt;u(x, y) = x^{2} - y^{2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;v(x, y)=2xy&lt;/math&gt;
respectively. The partial derivatives of these are 
:&lt;math&gt;\dfrac{ \partial u }{ \partial x } = 2x&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\dfrac{ \partial u }{ \partial y } = -2y&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\dfrac{ \partial v }{ \partial x } = 2y&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\dfrac{ \partial v }{ \partial y } = 2x&lt;/math&gt;.
These partial derivatives have the following relationships: 
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = -\frac{\partial v}{\partial x} &lt;/math&gt;.
Thus this complex-valued function ''f''(''z'') satisfies the Cauchy–Riemann equations.
: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
(1a)\qquad &amp; \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} \\[6pt]
(1b)\qquad &amp; \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = -\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

== Interpretation and reformulation ==

The equations are one way of looking at the condition on a function to be differentiable in the sense of [[complex analysis]]: in other words they encapsulate the notion of [[function of a complex variable]] by means of conventional [[differential calculus]]. In the theory there are several other major ways of looking at this notion, and the translation of the condition into other language is often needed.

=== Conformal mappings ===
First, the Cauchy–Riemann equations may be written in complex form

:(2){{quad}}&lt;math&gt;{ i \dfrac{ \partial f }{ \partial x } } = \dfrac{ \partial f }{ \partial y } . &lt;/math&gt;

In this form, the equations correspond structurally to the condition that the [[Jacobian matrix]] is of the form
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
  a &amp;   -b  \\
  b &amp; \;\; a  
\end{pmatrix},
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; a=\partial u/\partial x=\partial v/\partial y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; b=\partial v/\partial x=-\partial u/\partial y&lt;/math&gt;.  A matrix of this form is the [[Complex number#Matrix representation of complex numbers|matrix representation of a complex number]]. Geometrically, such a matrix is always the [[function composition|composition]] of a [[rotation]] with a [[Homothetic transformation|scaling]], and in particular preserves [[angle]]s. The Jacobian of a function ''f''(''z'') takes infinitesimal line segments at the intersection of two curves in z and rotates them to the corresponding segments in ''f''(''z''). Consequently, a function satisfying the Cauchy–Riemann equations, with a nonzero derivative, preserves the angle between curves in the plane.  That is, the Cauchy–Riemann equations are the conditions for a function to be [[conformal map|conformal]].

Moreover, because the composition of a conformal transformation with another conformal transformation is also conformal, the composition of a solution of the Cauchy–Riemann equations with a conformal map must itself solve the Cauchy–Riemann equations.  Thus the Cauchy–Riemann equations are conformally invariant.

=== Complex differentiability ===
Suppose that

: &lt;math&gt; f(z) = u(z) + i \cdot v(z) &lt;/math&gt;

is a function of a complex number ''z''.  Then the complex derivative of ''f'' at a point ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is defined by

: &lt;math&gt;\lim_{\underset{h\in\mathbf{C}}{h\to 0}} \frac{f(z_0+h)-f(z_0)}{h} = f'(z_0)&lt;/math&gt;

provided this limit exists.

If this limit exists, then it may be computed by taking the limit as ''h''&amp;nbsp;→ 0 along the real axis or imaginary axis; in either case it should give the same result.  Approaching along the real axis, one finds

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{\underset{h\in\mathbf{R}}{h\to 0}} \frac{f(z_0+h)-f(z_0)}{h} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(z_0).&lt;/math&gt;

On the other hand, approaching along the imaginary axis,

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{\underset{h\in \mathbf{R}}{h\to 0}} \frac{f(z_0+ih)-f(z_0)}{ih} =\frac{1}{i}\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(z_0).&lt;/math&gt;

The equality of the derivative of ''f'' taken along the two axis is

:&lt;math&gt;i\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(z_0)=\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(z_0),&lt;/math&gt;

which are the Cauchy–Riemann equations (2) at the point&amp;nbsp;''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.

Conversely, if ''f''&amp;nbsp;: '''C'''&amp;nbsp;→ '''C''' is a function which is differentiable when regarded as a function on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, then ''f'' is complex differentiable if and only if the Cauchy–Riemann equations hold. In other words, if u and v are real-differentiable functions of two real variables, obviously ''u'' + ''iv'' is a (complex-valued) real-differentiable function, but ''u'' + ''iv'' is complex-differentiable if and only if the Cauchy–Riemann equations hold.

Indeed, following {{harvtxt|Rudin|1966}}, suppose ''f'' is a complex function defined in an open set Ω&amp;nbsp;⊂ '''C'''.  Then, writing {{nowrap|''z'' {{=}} ''x'' + i''y''}} for every ''z''&amp;nbsp;∈ Ω, one can also regard Ω as an open subset of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and ''f'' as a function of two real variables ''x'' and ''y'', which maps Ω&amp;nbsp;⊂ '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to '''C'''.  We consider the Cauchy–Riemann equations at ''z''&amp;nbsp;= ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. So assume ''f'' is differentiable at ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, as a function of two real variables from Ω to '''C'''.  This is equivalent to the existence of the following linear approximation

:&lt;math&gt; f(z_0 + \Delta z) - f(z_0) = f_x \,\Delta x + f_y \,\Delta y + \eta(\Delta z) \,\Delta z \,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''z'' = ''x'' + ''iy'' and ''η''(Δ''z'') → 0 as Δ''z'' → 0.  Since &lt;math&gt; \Delta z + \Delta \bar{z}= 2 \, \Delta x &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \Delta z - \Delta \bar{z}=2i \, \Delta y &lt;/math&gt;, the above can be re-written as

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta f(z_0) = \frac{f_x - if_y}{2} \, \Delta z + \frac{f_x + if_y}{2} \, \Delta \bar{z} + \eta(\Delta z) \, \Delta z\, &lt;/math&gt;

Defining the two [[Wirtinger derivatives]] as

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial}{\partial z} = \frac{1}{2} \Bigl( \frac{\partial}{\partial x} - i \frac{\partial}{\partial y} \Bigr), \;\;\; \frac{\partial}{\partial\bar{z}}= \frac{1}{2} \Bigl( \frac{\partial}{\partial x} + i \frac{\partial}{\partial y} \Bigr),&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
in the limit  &lt;math&gt;\Delta z \rightarrow 0,\Delta \bar{z} \rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt; the above equality can be written as
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\left.\frac{df}{dz}\right|_{z=z_0} = \left.\frac{\partial f}{\partial z}\right |_{z=z_0} + \left.\frac{\partial f}{\partial\bar{z}}\right |_{z=z_0} \cdot \frac{d\bar{z}}{dz} + \eta(\Delta z), \;\;\;\;(\Delta z \neq 0). &lt;/math&gt;

Now consider the potential values of &lt;math&gt; d\bar{z}/dz &lt;/math&gt; when the limit is taken the origin. For ''z'' along the real line, &lt;math&gt; \bar{z} = z &lt;/math&gt; so that &lt;math&gt; d\bar{z}/dz = 1&lt;/math&gt;. Similarly for purely imaginary ''z'' we have &lt;math&gt; d\bar{z}/dz = -1 &lt;/math&gt; so that the value of &lt;math&gt; d\bar{z}/dz&lt;/math&gt; is not well defined at the origin. It's easy to verify that &lt;math&gt; d\bar{z}/dz&lt;/math&gt; is not well defined at any complex ''z'', hence ''f'' is complex differentiable at ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;  if and only if &lt;math&gt; (\partial f/\partial\bar{z}) = 0 &lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;z=z_0&lt;/math&gt;.  But this is exactly the Cauchy–Riemann equations, thus ''f'' is differentiable at ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; if and only if the Cauchy–Riemann equations hold at&amp;nbsp;''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.

=== Independence of the complex conjugate ===

The above proof suggests another interpretation of the Cauchy–Riemann equations.  The [[complex conjugate]] of ''z'', denoted &lt;math&gt;\bar{z}&lt;/math&gt;, is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\overline{x + iy} := x - iy&lt;/math&gt;

for real ''x'' and ''y''. The Cauchy–Riemann equations can then be written as a single equation

:(3){{quad}}&lt;math&gt;\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial\bar{z}} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

by using the [[Wirtinger derivatives|Wirtinger derivative with respect to the conjugate variable]]. In this form, the Cauchy–Riemann equations can be interpreted as the statement that ''f'' is independent of the variable &lt;math&gt;\bar{z}&lt;/math&gt;. As such, we can view analytic functions as true functions of ''one'' complex variable as opposed to complex functions of ''two'' real variables.

=== Physical interpretation ===
[[File:Contours of holomorphic function.png|right|thumb|[[Contour plot]] of a pair ''u'' and ''v'' satisfying the Cauchy–Riemann equations.  Streamlines (''v''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;const, red) are perpendicular to equipotentials (''u''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;const, blue).  The point (0,0) is a stationary point of the potential flow, with six streamlines meeting, and six equipotentials also meeting and bisecting the angles formed by the streamlines.]]
A standard physical interpretation of the Cauchy–Riemann equations going back to Riemann's work on function theory (see {{harvnb|Klein|1893}}) is that ''u'' represents a [[velocity potential]] of an incompressible [[potential flow|steady fluid flow]] in the plane, and ''v'' is its [[stream function]].  Suppose that the pair of (twice continuously differentiable) functions &lt;math&gt;u,v&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the Cauchy–Riemann equations.  We will take ''u'' to be a velocity potential, meaning that we imagine a flow of fluid in the plane such that the [[velocity vector]] of the fluid at each point of the plane is equal to the [[gradient]] of ''u'', defined by
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla u = \frac{\partial u}{\partial x}\mathbf i + \frac{\partial u}{\partial y}\mathbf j&lt;/math&gt;

By differentiating the Cauchy–Riemann equations a second time, one shows that ''u'' solves [[Laplace's equation]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial^2u}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2u}{\partial y^2} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;
That is, ''u'' is a [[harmonic function]].  This means that the [[divergence]] of the gradient is zero, and so the fluid is incompressible.

The function ''v'' also satisfies the Laplace equation, by a similar analysis.  Also, the Cauchy–Riemann equations imply that the [[dot product]] &lt;math&gt;\nabla u\cdot\nabla v = 0&lt;/math&gt;.  This implies that the gradient of ''u'' must point along the &lt;math&gt;v=\text{const}&lt;/math&gt; curves; so these are the [[Streamlines, streaklines, and pathlines|streamlines]] of the flow.  The &lt;math&gt;u=\text{const}&lt;/math&gt; curves are the [[equipotential curve]]s of the flow.

A holomorphic function can therefore be visualized by plotting the two families of [[level curve]]s &lt;math&gt;u=\text{const}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v=\text{const}&lt;/math&gt;.  Near points where the gradient of ''u'' (or, equivalently, ''v'') is not zero, these families form an [[orthogonal]] family of curves.  At the points where &lt;math&gt;\nabla u=0&lt;/math&gt;, the stationary points of the flow, the equipotential curves of &lt;math&gt;u=\text{const}&lt;/math&gt; intersect.  The streamlines also intersect at the same point, bisecting the angles formed by the equipotential curves.

=== Harmonic vector field ===
Another interpretation of the Cauchy–Riemann equations can be found in {{harvtxt|Pólya|Szegő|1978}}.  Suppose that ''u'' and ''v'' satisfy the Cauchy–Riemann equations in an open subset of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and consider the [[vector field]]

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{f} = \begin{bmatrix}u\\ -v\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

regarded as a (real) two-component vector.  Then the second Cauchy–Riemann equation (1b) asserts that &lt;math&gt;\bar{f}&lt;/math&gt; is [[irrotational vector field|irrotational]] (its [[Curl (mathematics)|curl]] is 0):

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial (-v)}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

The first Cauchy–Riemann equation (1a) asserts that the vector field is [[solenoidal vector field|solenoidal]] (or [[divergence]]-free):

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial (-v)}{\partial y}=0.&lt;/math&gt;

Owing respectively to [[Green's theorem]] and the [[divergence theorem]], such a field is necessarily a [[conservative vector field|conservative]] one, and it is free from sources or sinks, having net flux equal to zero through any open domain without holes.  (These two observations combine as real and imaginary parts in [[Cauchy's integral theorem]].) In [[fluid dynamics]], such a vector field is a [[potential flow]] {{harv|Chanson|2007}}.  In [[magnetostatics]], such vector fields model static [[magnetic field]]s on a region of the plane containing no current.  In [[electrostatics]], they model static electric fields in a region of the plane containing no electric charge.

This interpretation can equivalently be restated in the language of [[differential form]]s.  The pair ''u'',''v'' satisfy the Cauchy–Riemann equations if and only if the [[one-form]] &lt;math&gt;v\,dx + u\, dy&lt;/math&gt; is both [[Closed and exact differential forms|closed]] and [[codifferential|coclosed]] (a [[Hodge theory|harmonic differential form]]).

=== Preservation of complex structure ===
Another formulation of the Cauchy–Riemann equations involves the [[linear complex structure|complex structure]] in the plane, given by
:&lt;math&gt;J=\begin{bmatrix}0&amp;-1\\1&amp;0\end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;
This is a complex structure in the sense that the square of ''J'' is the negative of the 2&amp;times;2 identity matrix: &lt;math&gt;J^2=-I&lt;/math&gt;.  As above, if ''u''(''x'',''y''),''v''(''x'',''y'') are two functions in the plane, put

:&lt;math&gt;f(x,y) = \begin{bmatrix}u(x,y)\\v(x,y)\end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt; 

The [[Jacobian matrix]] of ''f'' is the matrix of partial derivatives

:&lt;math&gt;Df(x,y) = \begin{bmatrix}\dfrac{\partial u}{\partial x} &amp; \dfrac{\partial u}{\partial y} \\[12pt] \dfrac{\partial v}{\partial x} &amp; \dfrac{\partial v}{\partial y}\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Then the pair of functions ''u'', ''v'' satisfies the Cauchy–Riemann equations if and only if the 2&amp;times;2 matrix ''Df'' commutes with ''J'' {{harv|Kobayashi|Nomizu|1969|loc=Proposition IX.2.2}}

This interpretation is useful in [[symplectic geometry]], where it is the starting point for the study of [[pseudoholomorphic curve]]s.

=== Other representations ===
Other representations of the Cauchy–Riemann equations occasionally arise in other [[coordinate system]]s.  If (1a) and (1b) hold for a differentiable pair of functions ''u'' and ''v'', then so do

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial u}{\partial n} = \frac{\partial v}{\partial s},\quad \frac{\partial v}{\partial n} = -\frac{\partial u}{\partial s}&lt;/math&gt;

for any coordinate system {{nowrap|(''n''(''x'', ''y''), ''s''(''x'', ''y''))}} such that the pair (∇''n'', ∇''s'') is [[orthonormal]] and [[orientation (mathematics)|positively oriented]].  As a consequence, in particular,  in the system of coordinates given by the polar representation {{nowrap|''z'' {{=}} ''r''&amp;thinsp;''e''&lt;sup&gt;iθ&lt;/sup&gt;}}, the equations then take the form

:&lt;math&gt;{ \partial u \over \partial r } = {1 \over r}{ \partial v \over \partial \theta},\quad{ \partial v \over \partial r } = -{1 \over r}{ \partial u \over \partial \theta}.&lt;/math&gt;

Combining these into one equation for ''f'' gives

:&lt;math&gt;{\partial f \over \partial r} = {1 \over i r}{\partial f \over \partial \theta}.&lt;/math&gt;


The inhomogeneous Cauchy–Riemann equations consist of the two equations for a pair of unknown functions ''u''(''x'',''y'') and ''v''(''x'',''y'') of two real variables

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \frac{\partial u}{\partial x}-\frac{\partial v}{\partial y} = \alpha(x,y) \\[4pt]
&amp; \frac{\partial u}{\partial y}+\frac{\partial v}{\partial x} = \beta(x,y)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

for some given functions α(''x'',''y'') and β(''x'',''y'') defined in an open subset of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.  These equations are usually combined into a single equation

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial f}{\partial\bar{z}} = \varphi(z,\bar{z})&lt;/math&gt;

where ''f'' = ''u'' + i''v'' and ''φ'' = (''α'' + i''β'')/2.

If ''φ'' is [[continuously differentiable|''C''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;]], then the inhomogeneous equation is explicitly solvable in any bounded domain ''D'', provided ''φ'' is continuous on the [[closure (topology)|closure]] of ''D''.  Indeed, by the [[Cauchy integral formula]],

:&lt;math&gt;f(\zeta,\bar{\zeta}) = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \iint_D \varphi(z,\bar{z}) \, \frac{dz\wedge d\bar{z}}{z-\zeta}&lt;/math&gt;

for all ζ ∈ ''D''.

==Generalizations==

=== Goursat's theorem and its generalizations ===
{{see also|Cauchy–Goursat theorem}}

Suppose that {{nowrap|''f'' {{=}} ''u''&amp;thinsp;+&amp;thinsp;i''v''}} is a complex-valued function which is [[Fréchet derivative|differentiable]] as a function {{nowrap|''f'' : '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; → '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}.  Then '''[[Édouard Goursat|Goursat]]'s theorem''' asserts that ''f'' is analytic in an open complex domain Ω if and only if it satisfies the Cauchy–Riemann equation in the domain {{harv|Rudin|1966|loc=Theorem 11.2}}. In particular, continuous differentiability of ''f'' need not be assumed {{harv|Dieudonné|1969|loc=§9.10, Ex. 1}}.

The hypotheses of Goursat's theorem can be weakened significantly.  If {{nowrap|''f'' {{=}} ''u''&amp;thinsp;+&amp;thinsp;i''v''}} is continuous in an open set Ω and the [[partial derivative]]s of ''f'' with respect to ''x'' and ''y'' exist in Ω, and satisfy the Cauchy–Riemann equations throughout Ω, then ''f'' is holomorphic (and thus analytic).  This result is the [[Looman–Menchoff theorem]].

The hypothesis that ''f'' obey the Cauchy–Riemann equations throughout the domain Ω is essential.  It is possible to construct a continuous function satisfying the Cauchy–Riemann equations at a point, but which is not analytic at the point (e.g., ''f''(''z'')&amp;nbsp;= {{nowrap|''z''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;/&amp;thinsp;{{!}}z{{!}}&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;)}}.  Similarly, some additional assumption is needed besides the Cauchy–Riemann equations (such as continuity), as the following example illustrates {{harv|Looman|1923|p=107}}

:&lt;math&gt;f(z) = \begin{cases}
\exp(-z^{-4})&amp;\text{if }z\not=0\\
0&amp;\text{if }z=0
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

which satisfies the Cauchy–Riemann equations everywhere, but fails to be continuous at ''z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.

Nevertheless, if a function satisfies the Cauchy–Riemann equations in an open set in a [[weak derivative|weak sense]], then the function is analytic.  More precisely {{harv|Gray|Morris|1978|loc=Theorem 9}}:
* If ''f''(''z'') is locally integrable in an open domain Ω&amp;nbsp;⊂&amp;nbsp;'''C''', and satisfies the Cauchy–Riemann equations weakly, then ''f'' agrees [[almost everywhere]] with an analytic function in Ω.
This is in fact a special case of a more general result on the regularity of solutions of [[hypoelliptic operator|hypoelliptic]] partial differential equations.
===Several variables===
There are Cauchy–Riemann equations, appropriately generalized, in the theory of [[several complex variables]]. They form a significant [[overdetermined system]] of PDEs. This is done using a straightforward generalization of the [[Wirtinger derivative]], where the function in question is required to have the (partial) Wirtinger derivative with respect to each complex variable vanish.

===Complex differential forms===
As often formulated, the ''[[d-bar operator]]'' 

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{\partial}&lt;/math&gt;

annihilates holomorphic functions. This generalizes most directly the formulation

:&lt;math&gt;{\partial f \over \partial \bar z} = 0,&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;{\partial f \over \partial \bar z} = {1 \over 2}\left({\partial f \over \partial x} + i{\partial f \over \partial y}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

=== Bäcklund transform ===
Viewed as [[conjugate harmonic functions]], the Cauchy–Riemann equations are a simple example of a [[Bäcklund transform]]. More complicated, generally non-linear Bäcklund transforms, such as in the [[sine-Gordon equation]], are of great interest in the theory of [[soliton]]s and [[integrable system]]s.

=== Definition in Clifford algebra ===

In [[Clifford algebra]] the complex number &lt;math&gt;z = x+iy &lt;/math&gt; is represented as &lt;math&gt;z \equiv x + I y&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;I \equiv \sigma_1 \sigma_2&lt;/math&gt;. The fundamental derivative operator in Clifford algebra of [[Complex numbers]] is defined as &lt;math&gt;\nabla \equiv \sigma_1 \partial_x + \sigma_2\partial_y&lt;/math&gt;. The function &lt;math&gt;f=u + I v&lt;/math&gt; is considered analytic if and only if &lt;math&gt;\nabla f = 0&lt;/math&gt;, which can be calculated in following way:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
0 &amp; =\nabla f= ( \sigma_1 \partial_x + \sigma_2 \partial_y )(u + \sigma_1 \sigma_2 v) \\[4pt]
&amp; =\sigma_1 \partial_x u + \underbrace{\sigma_1 \sigma_1 \sigma_2}_{=\sigma_2} \partial_x v + \sigma_2 \partial_y u + \underbrace{\sigma_2 \sigma_1 \sigma_2}_{=-\sigma_1} \partial_y v =0
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Grouping by &lt;math&gt;\sigma_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_2&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla f = \sigma_1 ( \partial_x u - \partial_y v) + \sigma_2 ( \partial_x v + \partial_y u) = 0 \Leftrightarrow \begin{cases}
\partial_x u - \partial_y v = 0\\[4pt]
\partial_x v + \partial_y u = 0
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

Henceforth in traditional notation:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases}
\dfrac{ \partial u }{ \partial x } = \dfrac{ \partial v }{ \partial y }\\[12pt]
\dfrac{ \partial u }{ \partial y } = -\dfrac{ \partial v }{ \partial x }
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Conformal mappings in higher dimensions ===
Let &amp;Omega; be an open set in the Euclidean space '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.  The equation for an orientation-preserving mapping &lt;math&gt;f:\Omega\to\mathbf{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; to be a [[conformal mapping]] (that is, angle-preserving) is that
:&lt;math&gt;Df^TDf = (\det(Df))^{2/n}I&lt;/math&gt; 
where ''Df'' is the Jacobian matrix, with transpose &lt;math&gt;Df^T&lt;/math&gt;, and ''I'' denotes the identity matrix {{harv|Iwaniec|Martin|2001|p=32}}.  For {{math|''n'' {{=}} 2}}, this system is equivalent to the standard Cauchy–Riemann equations of complex variables, and the solutions are holomorphic functions.  In dimension {{math|''n'' &gt; 2}}, this is still sometimes called the Cauchy–Riemann system, and [[Liouville's theorem (conformal mappings)|Liouville's theorem]] implies, under suitable smoothness assumptions, that any such mapping is a [[Möbius transformation]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5251">The [[mathematical]] disciplines of [[combinatorics]] and [[dynamical system]]s interact in a number of ways. The [[ergodic theory]] of dynamical systems has recently been used to prove combinatorial theorems about number theory which has given rise to the field of [[arithmetic combinatorics]]. Also [[dynamical systems theory]] is heavily involved in the relatively recent field of [[combinatorics on words]]. Also combinatorial aspects of dynamical systems are studied. Dynamical systems can be defined on combinatorial objects; see for example [[graph dynamical system]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2714">In [[mathematics]], the notion of being '''compactly embedded''' expresses the idea that one set or space is "well contained" inside another. There are versions of this concept appropriate to general [[topology]] and [[functional analysis]].

==Definition (topological spaces)==

Let (''X'',&amp;nbsp;''T'') be a [[topological space]], and let ''V'' and ''W'' be [[subset]]s of ''X''. We say that ''V'' is '''compactly embedded''' in ''W'', and write ''V''&amp;nbsp;⊂⊂&amp;nbsp;''W'', if
* ''V''&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;Cl(''V'')&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;Int(''W''), where Cl(''V'') denotes the [[Closure (topology)|closure]] of ''V'', and Int(''W'') denotes the [[Interior (topology)|interior]] of ''W''; and
* Cl(''V'') is [[Compact space|compact]].

==Definition (normed spaces)==

Let ''X'' and ''Y'' be two [[normed vector space]]s with norms ||•||&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; and ||•||&lt;sub&gt;''Y''&lt;/sub&gt; respectively, and suppose that ''X''&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;''Y''. We say that ''X'' is '''compactly embedded''' in ''Y'', and write ''X''&amp;nbsp;⊂⊂&amp;nbsp;''Y'', if
* ''X'' is [[continuously embedded]] in ''Y''; i.e., there is a constant ''C'' such that ||''x''||&lt;sub&gt;''Y''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''C''||''x''||&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; for all ''x'' in ''X''; and
* The embedding of ''X'' into ''Y'' is a [[compact operator]]: any [[bounded set]] in ''X'' is [[totally bounded]] in ''Y'', i.e. every [[sequence]] in such a bounded set has a [[subsequence]] that is [[Cauchy sequence|Cauchy]] in the norm ||•||&lt;sub&gt;''Y''&lt;/sub&gt;.

If ''Y'' is a [[Banach space]], an equivalent definition is that the embedding operator (the identity) ''i''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''X''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''Y'' is a [[compact operator]].

When applied to functional analysis, this version of compact embedding is usually used with [[Banach spaces]] of functions. Several of the [[Sobolev inequality|Sobolev embedding theorems]] are compact embedding theorems. When an embedding is not compact, it may possess a related, but weaker, property of [[Cocompact embedding|cocompactness]].

In [[cryptography]], a [[boolean function]] is said to be '''complete''' if the value of each output bit depends on ''all'' input bits. 

This is a desirable property to have in an encryption cipher, so that if one bit of the input ([[plaintext]]) is changed, every bit of the output ([[ciphertext]]) has an average of 50% [[probability]] of changing. The easiest way to show why this is good is the following: consider that if we changed our 8-byte plaintext's last byte, it would only have any effect on the 8th byte of the ciphertext. This would mean that if the attacker guessed 256 different plaintext-ciphertext pairs, he would always know the last byte of every 8byte sequence we send (effectively 12.5% of all our data). Finding out 256 plaintext-ciphertext pairs is not hard at all in the internet world, given that standard protocols are used, and standard protocols have standard headers and commands (e.g. "get", "put", "mail from:", etc.) which the attacker can safely guess. On the other hand, if our cipher has this property (and is generally secure in other ways, too), the attacker would need to collect 2&lt;sup&gt;64&lt;/sup&gt; (~10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;) plaintext-ciphertext pairs to crack the cipher in this way.

In its simplest form, the bound states that the variance of any [[bias of an estimator|unbiased]] estimator is at least as high as the inverse of the [[Fisher information]]. An unbiased estimator which achieves this lower bound is said to be (fully) [[Efficiency (statistics)|efficient]]. Such a solution achieves the lowest possible [[mean squared error]] among all unbiased methods, and is therefore the [[minimum variance unbiased]] (MVU) estimator. However, in some cases, no unbiased technique exists which achieves the bound. This may occur even when an MVU estimator exists.

The Cramér–Rao bound can also be used to bound the variance of [[estimator bias|''biased'' estimators]] of given bias. In some cases, a biased approach can result in both a variance and a [[mean squared error]] that are ''below'' the unbiased Cramér–Rao lower bound; see [[estimator bias]].

== Statement ==

The Cramér–Rao bound is stated in this section for several increasingly general cases, beginning with the case in which the parameter is a [[Scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] and its estimator is [[estimator bias|unbiased]]. All versions of the bound require certain regularity conditions, which hold for most well-behaved distributions. These conditions are listed [[#Regularity conditions|later in this section]].

=== Scalar unbiased case ===
Suppose &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is an unknown deterministic parameter which is to be estimated from measurements &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, distributed according to some [[probability density function]] &lt;math&gt;f(x;\theta)&lt;/math&gt;. The [[variance]] of any ''unbiased'' estimator &lt;math&gt;\hat{\theta}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is then bounded by the [[multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of the [[Fisher information]] &lt;math&gt;I(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{var}(\hat{\theta})
\geq
\frac{1}{I(\theta)}
&lt;/math&gt;
where the Fisher information &lt;math&gt;I(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; is defined by
:&lt;math&gt;
I(\theta) = \operatorname{E}
 \left[
  \left(
   \frac{\partial \ell(x;\theta)}{\partial\theta}
  \right)^2
 \right] = -\operatorname{E}\left[ \frac{\partial^2 \ell(x;\theta)}{\partial\theta^2} \right]
&lt;/math&gt;
and &lt;math&gt;\ell(x;\theta)=\log  (f(x;\theta))&lt;/math&gt; is the [[natural logarithm]] of the [[likelihood function]] and &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[expected value]] (over &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;).

The [[efficiency (statistics)|efficiency]] of an unbiased estimator &lt;math&gt;\hat{\theta}&lt;/math&gt; measures how close this estimator's variance comes to this lower bound; estimator efficiency is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;e(\hat{\theta}) = \frac{I(\theta)^{-1}}{\operatorname{var}(\hat{\theta})}&lt;/math&gt;

or the minimum possible variance for an unbiased estimator divided by its actual variance.
The Cramér–Rao lower bound thus gives
:&lt;math&gt;e(\hat{\theta}) \le 1.&lt;/math&gt;

=== General scalar case ===
A more general form of the bound can be obtained by considering a biased estimator &lt;math&gt;T(X)&lt;/math&gt; of a function of the parameter, &lt;math&gt;\psi(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;. Here, biasedness is understood as stating that &lt;math&gt; E\{T(X)\} - \theta = \psi(\theta) - \theta &lt;/math&gt;  is not generally equal to 0. In this case, the bound is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
\operatorname{var}(T)
\geq
\frac{[\psi'(\theta)]^2}{I(\theta)}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\psi'(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; is the derivative of &lt;math&gt;\psi(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; (by &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;), and &lt;math&gt;I(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; is the Fisher information defined above.

=== Bound on the variance of biased estimators ===
Apart from being a bound on estimators of functions of the parameter, this approach can be used to derive a bound on the variance of biased estimators with a given bias, as follows. Consider an estimator &lt;math&gt;\hat{\theta}&lt;/math&gt; with bias &lt;math&gt;b(\theta) = E\{\hat{\theta}\} - \theta&lt;/math&gt;, and let &lt;math&gt;\psi(\theta) = b(\theta) + \theta&lt;/math&gt;. By the result above, any unbiased estimator whose expectation is &lt;math&gt;\psi(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; has variance greater than or equal to &lt;math&gt;(\psi'(\theta))^2/I(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, any estimator &lt;math&gt;\hat{\theta}&lt;/math&gt; whose bias is given by a function &lt;math&gt;b(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; satisfies
:&lt;math&gt;
\operatorname{var} \left(\hat{\theta}\right)
\geq
\frac{[1+b'(\theta)]^2}{I(\theta)}.
&lt;/math&gt;
The unbiased version of the bound is a special case of this result, with &lt;math&gt;b(\theta)=0&lt;/math&gt;.

It's trivial to have a small variance − an "estimator" that is constant has a variance of zero. But from the above equation we find that the [[mean squared error]] of a biased estimator is bounded by

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}\left((\hat{\theta}-\theta)^2\right)\geq\frac{[1+b'(\theta)]^2}{I(\theta)}+b(\theta)^2,&lt;/math&gt;

using the standard decomposition of the MSE. Note, however, that if &lt;math&gt;1+b'(\theta)&lt;1&lt;/math&gt; this bound might be less than the unbiased Cramér–Rao bound &lt;math&gt;1/I(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;. For instance, in the [[#Normal_variance_with_known_mean|example of estimating variance below]], &lt;math&gt;1+b'(\theta)= \frac{n}{n+2} &lt;1&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Multivariate case ===
Extending the Cramér–Rao bound to multiple parameters, define a parameter column [[vector space|vector]]
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\theta} = \left[ \theta_1, \theta_2, \dots, \theta_d \right]^T \in \mathbb{R}^d&lt;/math&gt;
with probability density function &lt;math&gt;f(x; \boldsymbol{\theta})&lt;/math&gt; which satisfies the two [[#Regularity conditions|regularity conditions]] below.

The [[Fisher information matrix]] is a &lt;math&gt;d \times d&lt;/math&gt; matrix with element &lt;math&gt;I_{m, k}&lt;/math&gt; defined as
: &lt;math&gt;
I_{m, k}
= \operatorname{E} \left[
 \frac{\partial }{\partial \theta_m} \log f\left(x; \boldsymbol{\theta}\right)
 \frac{\partial }{\partial \theta_k} \log f\left(x; \boldsymbol{\theta}\right)
\right] = -\operatorname{E} \left[
 \frac{\partial ^2}{\partial \theta_m \partial \theta_k} \log f\left(x; \boldsymbol{\theta}\right)
\right].
&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{T}(X)&lt;/math&gt; be an estimator of any vector function of parameters, &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{T}(X) = (T_1(X), \ldots, T_d(X))^T&lt;/math&gt;, and denote its expectation vector &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[\boldsymbol{T}(X)]&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\psi}(\boldsymbol{\theta})&lt;/math&gt;. The Cramér–Rao bound then states that the [[covariance matrix]] of &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{T}(X)&lt;/math&gt; satisfies
:&lt;math&gt;
\operatorname{cov}_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\left(\boldsymbol{T}(X)\right)
\geq
\frac
 {\partial \boldsymbol{\psi} \left(\boldsymbol{\theta}\right)}
 {\partial \boldsymbol{\theta}}
\left(
[I\left(\boldsymbol{\theta}\right)]^{-1}
 \frac
  {\partial \boldsymbol{\psi}\left(\boldsymbol{\theta}\right)}
  {\partial \boldsymbol{\theta}}
\right)^T
&lt;/math&gt;
where
* The matrix inequality &lt;math&gt;A \ge B&lt;/math&gt; is understood to mean that the matrix &lt;math&gt;A-B&lt;/math&gt; is [[positive semidefinite matrix|positive semidefinite]], and
* &lt;math&gt;\partial \boldsymbol{\psi}(\boldsymbol{\theta})/\partial \boldsymbol{\theta}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Jacobian matrix]] whose &lt;math&gt;ij&lt;/math&gt; element is given by &lt;math&gt;\partial \psi_i(\boldsymbol{\theta})/\partial \theta_j&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;!-- please leave this extra space as it improves legibility. --&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{T}(X)&lt;/math&gt; is an [[estimator bias|unbiased]] estimator of &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\theta}&lt;/math&gt; (i.e., &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\psi}\left(\boldsymbol{\theta}\right) = \boldsymbol{\theta}&lt;/math&gt;), then the Cramér–Rao bound reduces to
: &lt;math&gt;
\operatorname{cov}_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\left(\boldsymbol{T}(X)\right)
\geq
I\left(\boldsymbol{\theta}\right)^{-1}.
&lt;/math&gt;

If it is inconvenient to compute the inverse of the [[Fisher information matrix]],
then one can simply take the reciprocal of the corresponding diagonal element
to find a (possibly loose) lower bound.&lt;ref&gt;For the Bayesian case, see eqn. (11) of {{cite journal |last=Bobrovsky |last2=Mayer-Wolf |last3=Zakai |title=Some classes of global Cramer–Rao bounds |journal=Ann. Stat. |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=1421–38 |year=1987 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
\operatorname{var}_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(T_m(X))
=
\left[\operatorname{cov}_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\left(\boldsymbol{T}(X)\right)\right]_{mm}
\geq
\left[I\left(\boldsymbol{\theta}\right)^{-1}\right]_{mm}
\geq
\left(\left[I\left(\boldsymbol{\theta}\right)\right]_{mm}\right)^{-1}.
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Regularity conditions ===
The bound relies on two weak regularity conditions on the [[probability density function]], &lt;math&gt;f(x; \theta)&lt;/math&gt;, and the estimator &lt;math&gt;T(X)&lt;/math&gt;:
* The Fisher information is always defined; equivalently, for all &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f(x; \theta) &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;,
::&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial}{\partial\theta} \log f(x;\theta)&lt;/math&gt;
:exists, and is finite.
* The operations of integration with respect to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and differentiation with respect to &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; can be interchanged in the expectation of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;; that is,
::&lt;math&gt;
 \frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}
 \left[
  \int T(x) f(x;\theta) \,dx
 \right]
 =
 \int T(x)
  \left[
   \frac{\partial}{\partial\theta} f(x;\theta)
  \right]
 \,dx
&lt;/math&gt;
:whenever the right-hand side is finite.
:This condition can often be confirmed by using the fact that integration and differentiation can be swapped when either of the following cases hold:
:# The function &lt;math&gt;f(x;\theta)&lt;/math&gt; has bounded support in &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, and the bounds do not depend on &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;;
:# The function &lt;math&gt;f(x;\theta)&lt;/math&gt; has infinite support, is [[continuously differentiable]], and the integral converges uniformly for all &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Simplified form of the Fisher information ===
Suppose, in addition, that the operations of integration and differentiation can be swapped for the second derivative of &lt;math&gt;f(x;\theta)&lt;/math&gt; as well, i.e.,
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial^2}{\partial\theta^2}
 \left[
  \int T(x) f(x;\theta) \,dx
 \right]
 =
 \int T(x)
  \left[
   \frac{\partial^2}{\partial\theta^2} f(x;\theta)
  \right]
 \,dx.
&lt;/math&gt;
In this case, it can be shown that the Fisher information equals
:&lt;math&gt;
I(\theta)
=
 -\operatorname{E}
 \left[
  \frac{\partial^2}{\partial\theta^2} \log f(X;\theta)
 \right].
&lt;/math&gt;
The Cramèr–Rao bound can then be written as
:&lt;math&gt;
\operatorname{var} \left(\widehat{\theta}\right)
\geq
\frac{1}{I(\theta)}
= \frac{1}
{ -\operatorname{E}
 \left[
  \frac{\partial^2}{\partial\theta^2} \log f(X;\theta)
 \right]}.
&lt;/math&gt;
In some cases, this formula gives a more convenient technique for evaluating the bound.

== Single-parameter proof ==
The following is a proof of the general scalar case of the Cramér–Rao bound described [[#General scalar case|above]].  Assume that &lt;math&gt;T=t(X)&lt;/math&gt; is an unbiased estimator for the value &lt;math&gt;\psi(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; (based on the observations &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;), and so &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}(T) = \psi (\theta)&lt;/math&gt;.  The goal is to prove that, for all &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{var}(t(X)) \geq \frac{[\psi^\prime(\theta)]^2}{I(\theta)}.&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a [[random variable]] with probability density function &lt;math&gt;f(x; \theta)&lt;/math&gt;.
Here &lt;math&gt;T = t(X)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[statistic]], which is used as an [[estimator]] for &lt;math&gt;\psi (\theta)&lt;/math&gt;.  Define &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; as the [[score (statistics)|score]]:

:&lt;math&gt;V = \frac{\partial}{\partial\theta} \ln f(X;\theta) = \frac{1}{f(X;\theta)}\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}f(X;\theta)&lt;/math&gt;

where the [[chain rule]] is used in the final equality above. Then the [[expected value|expectation]] of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, written &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}(V)&lt;/math&gt;, is zero.  This is because:

: &lt;math&gt;
\operatorname{E}(V)  = \int f(x;\theta)\left[\frac{1}{f(x;\theta)}\frac{\partial }{\partial \theta} f(x;\theta)\right] \, dx = \frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}\int f(x;\theta) \, dx = 0
&lt;/math&gt;

where the integral and partial derivative have been interchanged (justified by the second regularity condition).


If we consider the [[covariance]] &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{cov}(V, T)&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{cov}(V, T) = \operatorname{E}(V T)&lt;/math&gt;, because &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}(V) = 0&lt;/math&gt;.  Expanding this expression we have

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\operatorname{cov}(V,T)
&amp; = \operatorname{E}
\left(
 T \cdot\left[\frac{1}{f(X;\theta)}\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}f(X;\theta)  \right]
\right) \\[6pt]
&amp; = \int t(x) \left[\frac{1}{f(x;\theta)} \frac{\partial}{\partial\theta} f(x;\theta) \right] f(x;\theta)\, dx \\[6pt]
&amp; = \frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}
\left[ \int t(x) f(x;\theta)\,dx \right]
= \psi^\prime(\theta)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

again because the integration and differentiation operations commute (second condition).

The [[Cauchy–Schwarz inequality]] shows that

:&lt;math&gt;
\sqrt{ \operatorname{var} (T) \operatorname{var} (V)} \geq \left| \operatorname{cov}(V,T) \right| = \left | \psi^\prime (\theta)
\right |&lt;/math&gt;

therefore

:&lt;math&gt;
\operatorname{var}  (T) \geq \frac{[\psi^\prime(\theta)]^2}{\operatorname{var} (V)}
= \frac{[\psi^\prime(\theta)]^2}{I(\theta)}
&lt;/math&gt;
which proves the proposition.

== Examples ==

=== Multivariate normal distribution ===
For the case of a [[multivariate normal distribution|''d''-variate normal distribution]]
: &lt;math&gt;
\boldsymbol{x}
\sim
N_d
\left(
 \boldsymbol{\mu}( \boldsymbol{\theta})
 ,
 {\boldsymbol C} ( \boldsymbol{\theta})
\right)
&lt;/math&gt;
the [[Fisher information matrix]] has elements&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  | isbn = 0-13-042268-1 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
I_{m, k}
= \frac{\partial \boldsymbol{\mu}^T}{\partial \theta_m}
{\boldsymbol C}^{-1}
\frac{\partial \boldsymbol{\mu}}{\partial \theta_k}
+ \frac{1}{2}
\operatorname{tr}
\left(
 {\boldsymbol C}^{-1}
 \frac{\partial {\boldsymbol C}}{\partial \theta_m}
 {\boldsymbol C}^{-1}
 \frac{\partial {\boldsymbol C}}{\partial \theta_k}
\right)
&lt;/math&gt;
where "tr" is the [[trace (matrix)|trace]].

For example, let &lt;math&gt;w[n]&lt;/math&gt; be a sample of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; independent observations with unknown mean &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; and known variance &lt;math&gt;\sigma^2&lt;/math&gt; .
:&lt;math&gt;w[n] \sim \mathbb{N}_N \left(\theta {\boldsymbol 1}, \sigma^2 {\boldsymbol I} \right).&lt;/math&gt;
Then the Fisher information is a scalar given by

:&lt;math&gt;
I(\theta)
=
\left(\frac{\partial\boldsymbol{\mu}(\theta)}{\partial\theta}\right)^T{\boldsymbol C}^{-1} \left(\frac{\partial\boldsymbol{\mu}(\theta)}{\partial\theta}\right)
= \sum^N_{i=1}\frac{1}{\sigma^2} = \frac{N}{\sigma^2},
&lt;/math&gt;

and so the Cramér–Rao bound is

:&lt;math&gt;
\operatorname{var}\left(\hat \theta\right)
\geq
\frac{\sigma^2}{N}.
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Normal variance with known mean ===
Suppose ''X'' is a [[normal distribution|normally distributed]] random variable with known mean &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; and unknown variance &lt;math&gt;\sigma^2&lt;/math&gt;.  Consider the following statistic:

:&lt;math&gt;
T=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i-\mu)^2}{n}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Then ''T'' is unbiased for &lt;math&gt;\sigma^2&lt;/math&gt;, as &lt;math&gt;E(T)=\sigma^2&lt;/math&gt;.  What is the variance of ''T''?

:&lt;math&gt;
\operatorname{var}(T) = \frac{\operatorname{var}(X-\mu)^2}{n}=\frac{1}{n}
\left[
\operatorname{E}\left\{(X-\mu)^4\right\}-\left(\operatorname{E}\{(X-\mu)^2\}\right)^2
\right]
&lt;/math&gt;

(the second equality follows directly from the definition of variance).  The first term is the fourth [[moment about the mean]] and has value &lt;math&gt;3(\sigma^2)^2&lt;/math&gt;; the second is the square of the variance, or &lt;math&gt;(\sigma^2)^2&lt;/math&gt;.
Thus

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{var}(T)=\frac{2(\sigma^2)^2}{n}.&lt;/math&gt;

Now, what is the [[Fisher information]] in the sample? Recall that the [[score (statistics)|score]] ''V'' is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;
V=\frac{\partial}{\partial\sigma^2}\log L(\sigma^2,X)
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is the [[likelihood function]].  Thus in this case,

:&lt;math&gt;
V=\frac{\partial}{\partial\sigma^2}\log\left[\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}e^{-(X-\mu)^2 /{2\sigma^2}}\right] =\frac{(X-\mu)^2}{2(\sigma^2)^2}-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}
&lt;/math&gt;

where the second equality is from elementary calculus.  Thus, the information in a single observation is just minus the expectation of the derivative of ''V'', or

:&lt;math&gt;
I
=-\operatorname{E}\left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial\sigma^2}\right)
=-\operatorname{E}\left(-\frac{(X-\mu)^2}{(\sigma^2)^3}+\frac{1}{2(\sigma^2)^2}\right)
=\frac{\sigma^2}{(\sigma^2)^3}-\frac{1}{2(\sigma^2)^2}
=\frac{1}{2(\sigma^2)^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus the information in a sample of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; independent observations is just &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; times this, or &lt;math&gt;\frac{n}{2(\sigma^2)^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

The Cramer–Rao bound states that

:&lt;math&gt;
\operatorname{var}(T)\geq\frac{1}{I}.&lt;/math&gt;

In this case, the inequality is saturated (equality is achieved), showing that the [[estimator]] is [[efficiency (statistics)|efficient]].

However, we can achieve a lower [[mean squared error]] using a biased estimator. The estimator

:&lt;math&gt;
T=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i-\mu)^2}{n+2}.
&lt;/math&gt;

obviously has a smaller variance, which is in fact

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{var}(T)=\frac{2n(\sigma^2)^2}{(n+2)^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

Its bias is

: &lt;math&gt;\left(1-\frac{n}{n+2}\right)\sigma^2=\frac{2\sigma^2}{n+2}&lt;/math&gt;

so its mean squared error is

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{MSE}(T)=\left(\frac{2n}{(n+2)^2}+\frac{4}{(n+2)^2}\right)(\sigma^2)^2
=\frac{2(\sigma^2)^2}{n+2}&lt;/math&gt;

which is clearly less than the Cramér–Rao bound found above.

When the mean is not known, the minimum mean squared error estimate of the variance of a sample from Gaussian distribution is achieved by dividing by ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1, rather than ''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 or ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2.

In [[applied mathematics]] and [[Astrodynamics]], in the theory of [[dynamical systems]], a '''crisis''' is the sudden appearance or disappearance of a [[strange attractor]] as the parameters of a [[dynamical system]] are varied.&lt;ref&gt;Grebogi, C., E. Ott, and J. A. Yorke. Crises, sudden changes in chaotic attractors and transient chaos. Physica D 7, 181–200, 1983&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ali H. Nayfeh, Balakumar Balachandran. Applied Nonlinear Dynamics: Analytical, Computational, and Experimental Methods. Wiley, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Bifurcation theory#Global bifurcations|global bifurcation]] occurs when a [[Chaos theory|chaotic]] attractor comes into contact with an [[unstable]] [[periodic orbit]] or its [[stable manifold]].&lt;ref&gt;Arnol’d, V.I., Afraimovich, V.S., Ilyashenko,Yu.S. &amp; Shilnikov, L.P. 1993. Bifurcation theory and catastrophe theory. In Dynamical Systems, vol. 5, Berlin and New York: Springer&lt;/ref&gt; As the orbit approaches the unstable orbit it will diverge away from the previous attractor, leading to a qualitatively different behaviour. Crises can produce [[intermittency|intermittent]] behaviour.

Grebogi, Ott, Romeiras, and Yorke distinguished between three types of crises:&lt;ref&gt;Grebogi, C., E. Ott, arid J. A. Yorke. Chaos, strange attractors, and fractal basin boundaries in nonlinear dynamics, Science. 238, 632–638, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

* The first type, a '''boundary''' or an '''exterior crisis''', the attractor is suddenly destroyed as the parameters are varied. In the postbifurcation state the motion is transiently chaotic, moving chaotically along the former attractor before being attracted to a [[Fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]], periodic orbit, [[Quasiperiodic motion|quasiperiodic orbit]], another strange attractor, or diverging to infinity.
* In the second type of crisis, an '''interior crisis''', the size of the chaotic attractor suddenly increases. The attractor encounters an unstable fixed point or periodic solution that is inside the [[basin of attraction]].
* In the third type, an '''attractor merging crisis''', two or more chaotic attractors merge to form a single attractor as the critical parameter value is passed.

Note that the reverse case (sudden appearance, shrinking or splitting of attractors) can also occur. The latter two crises are sometimes called explosive bifurcations.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, J. M. T., H. B. Stewart, and Y. Ueda (1994). Safe, explosive, and dangerous bifurcations in dissipative dynamical systems, Phys. Rev. E49, 1019–1027&lt;/ref&gt;

While crises are "sudden" as a parameter is varied, the dynamics of the system over time can show long transients before orbits leave the neighbourhood of the old attractor. Typically there is a time constant τ for the length of the transient that diverges as a power law (τ&amp;nbsp;≈&amp;nbsp;|''p''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''p''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;|&lt;sup&gt;''γ''&lt;/sup&gt;) near the critical parameter value ''p''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;. The exponent ''γ'' is called the critical crisis exponent.&lt;ref&gt;Grebogi C., Ott E., Romeiras F. and Yorke J. A. Critical Exponents for Crisis Induced Intermittency, Phys. Rev. A 36, 5365. (1987)&lt;/ref&gt; There also exist systems where the divergence is stronger than a power law, so-called super-persistent chaotic transients.&lt;ref&gt;Grebogi C., Ott E. and Yorke J. A. Super-Persistent Chaotic Transients, Ergodic Theor. and Dyn. Sys. 5, 341. (1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7978">In [[mathematics]], a '''directed set''' (or a '''directed preorder''' or a '''filtered set''') is a nonempty [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''A'' together with a [[reflexive relation|reflexive]] and [[transitive relation|transitive]] [[binary relation]] ≤ (that is, a [[preorder]]), with the additional property that every pair of elements has an [[upper bound]].&lt;ref&gt;Kelley, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, for any ''a'' and ''b'' in ''A'' there must exist ''c'' in ''A'' with ''a'' ≤ ''c'' and ''b'' ≤ ''c''.

The notion defined above is sometimes called an '''upward directed set'''. A '''downward directed set''' is defined analogously,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert S. Borden|title=A Course in Advanced Calculus|year=1988|publisher=Courier Corporation|isbn=978-0-486-15038-3|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning when every pair of elements is bounded below.&lt;ref name="Brown-Pearcy"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Arlen Brown|author2=Carl Pearcy|title=An Introduction to Analysis|year=1995|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4612-0787-0|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors (and this article) assume that a directed set is directed upward, unless otherwise stated. Beware that other authors call a set directed if and only if it is directed both upward and downward.&lt;ref name="CarlHeikkilä2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Siegfried Carl|author2=Seppo Heikkilä|title=Fixed Point Theory in Ordered Sets and Applications: From Differential and Integral Equations to Game Theory|year=2010|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4419-7585-0|pages=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Directed sets are a generalization of nonempty [[totally ordered set]]s. That is, all totally ordered sets are directed sets (contrast [[partially ordered sets|''partially'' ordered sets]], which need not be directed). Join [[semilattice]]s (which are partially ordered sets) are directed sets as well, but not conversely. Likewise, [[Lattice (order)|lattice]]s are directed sets both upward and downward.

In [[topology]], directed sets are used to define [[net (topology)|nets]], which generalize [[sequence]]s and unite the various notions of [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] used in [[mathematical analysis|analysis]]. Directed sets also give rise to [[direct limit]]s in [[abstract algebra]] and (more generally) [[category theory]].

== Equivalent definition ==
In addition to the definition above, there is an equivalent definition. A '''directed set''' is a set ''A'' with a preorder such that every finite subset of ''A'' has an upper bound. In this definition, the existence of an upper bound of the [[empty set|empty subset]] implies that ''A'' is nonempty.

== Examples ==
Examples of directed sets include:
* The set of [[natural number]]s '''N''' with the ordinary order ≤ is a directed set (and so is every [[total order|totally ordered set]]).
* Let '''D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' and '''D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''' be directed sets. Then the Cartesian product set '''D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''' can be made into a directed set by defining (''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) ≤ (''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) if and only if ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. In analogy to the [[product order]] this is the product direction on the Cartesian product.
* It follows from previous example that the set '''N''' &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; '''N''' of pairs of natural numbers can be made into a directed set by defining (''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) ≤ (''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) if and only if ''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ ''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.
* If ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[real number]], we can turn the set '''R''' − {''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;} into a directed set by writing ''a'' ≤ ''b'' if and only if &lt;br&gt;|''a'' − ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;| ≥ |''b'' − ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;|. We then say that the reals have been ''directed towards x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''. This is an example of a directed set that is not [[partial order|ordered]] (neither totally nor partially).
* A (trivial) example of a partially ordered set that is '''''not''''' directed is the set {''a'', ''b''}, in which the only order relations are ''a'' ≤ ''a'' and ''b'' ≤ ''b''. A less trivial example is like the previous example of the "reals directed towards x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;" but in which the ordering rule only applies to pairs of elements on the same side of x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.
* If ''T'' is a [[topological space]] and ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is a point in ''T'', we turn the set of all [[topological neighbourhood|neighbourhoods]] of ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; into a directed set by writing ''U'' ≤ ''V'' if and only if ''U'' contains ''V''.
** For every ''U'': ''U'' ≤ ''U''; since ''U'' contains itself.
** For every ''U'', ''V,'' and ''W'': if ''U'' ≤ ''V'' and ''V'' ≤ ''W'', then we have ''U'' &lt;math&gt;\supseteq&lt;/math&gt; ''V'' and ''V'' &lt;math&gt;\supseteq&lt;/math&gt; ''W'', which implies ''U'' &lt;math&gt;\supseteq&lt;/math&gt; ''W''. Thus ''U ≤ W.''
** For every ''U'' and ''V'': since ''x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt; ''U'' &lt;math&gt;\cap&lt;/math&gt; ''V'', and since both ''U'' &lt;math&gt;\supseteq&lt;/math&gt; ''U &lt;math&gt;\cap&lt;/math&gt; V'' and ''V'' &lt;math&gt;\supseteq&lt;/math&gt; ''U &lt;math&gt;\cap&lt;/math&gt; V'', we have ''U ≤ U &lt;math&gt;\cap&lt;/math&gt; V'' and V ''≤ U &lt;math&gt;\cap&lt;/math&gt; V.''
* In a [[poset]] ''P'', every lower closure of an element, i.e. every subset of the form {''a'' | ''a'' in ''P'', ''a'' ≤''x''} where ''x'' is a fixed element from ''P'', is directed.

== Contrast with semilattices ==
[[File:Directed_set,_but_no_join_semi-lattice.png|thumb|x100px|Witness]]

Directed sets are a more general concept than (join) semilattices: every [[semilattice|join semilattice]] is a directed set, as the join or least upper bound of two elements is the desired ''c''.  The converse does not hold however, witness the directed set {1000,0001,1101,1011,1111} [[coordinatewise order|ordered bitwise]] (e.g. 1000 ≤ 1011 holds, but 0001 ≤ 1000 does not, since in the last bit 1 &gt; 0), where {1000,0001} has three upper bounds but no ''least'' upper bound, cf. picture. (Also note that without 1111, the set is not directed.)

== Directed subsets ==
The order relation in a directed set is not required to be [[antisymmetric relation|antisymmetric]], and therefore directed sets are not always [[partial order]]s. However, the term ''directed set'' is also used frequently in the context of posets. In this setting, a subset ''A'' of a partially ordered set (''P'',≤) is called a '''directed subset''' if it is a directed set according to the same partial order: in other words, it is not the [[empty set]], and every pair of elements has an upper bound. Here the order relation on the elements of ''A'' is inherited from ''P''; for this reason, reflexivity and transitivity need not be required explicitly.

A directed subset of a poset is not required to be [[lower set|downward closed]]; a subset of a poset is directed if and only if its downward closure is an [[ideal (order theory)|ideal]]. While the definition of a directed set is for an "upward-directed" set (every pair of elements has an upper bound), it is also possible to define a downward-directed set in which every pair of elements has a common lower bound. A subset of a poset is downward-directed if and only if its upper closure is a [[filter (mathematics)|filter]].

Directed subsets are used in [[domain theory]], which studies [[directed complete partial order]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Gierz, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; These are posets in which every upward-directed set is required to have a [[least upper bound]]. In this context, directed subsets again provide a generalization of convergent sequences.

{{distinguish|Disjunctive union}}

In [[set theory]], the '''disjoint union''' (or '''discriminated union''') of a family of sets is a modified [[union (set theory)|union]] operation that indexes the elements according to which set they originated in. Or slightly different from this, the disjoint union of a family of subsets is the usual union of the subsets which are [[pairwise disjoint]] &amp;ndash; [[disjoint sets]] means they have no element in common.

Note that these two concepts are different but strongly related. Moreover, it seems that they are essentially identical to each other in [[category theory]]. That is, both are realizations of the [[coproduct]] of [[category of sets]].  

==Example==
Consider the sets &lt;math&gt;A_0 = \{1, 2, 3\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A_1 = \{1, 2\}&lt;/math&gt;. We can index the set elements according to  set origin by forming the associated sets
: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
    A^*_0 &amp; = \{(1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0)\} \\
    A^*_1 &amp; = \{(1, 1), (2, 1)\},
\end{align}
  &lt;/math&gt;
where the second element in each pair matches the subscript of the origin set (e.g., the &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;(1, 0)&lt;/math&gt; matches the subscript in &lt;math&gt;A_0&lt;/math&gt;, etc.). The disjoint union &lt;math&gt;A_0 \sqcup A_1&lt;/math&gt; can then be calculated as follows:
: &lt;math&gt;
    A_0 \sqcup A_1 = A^*_0 \cup A^*_1 = \{(1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1)\}.
  &lt;/math&gt;

==Set theory definition==
Formally, let {''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; : ''i'' ∈ ''I''} be a [[family of sets]] indexed by ''I''. The '''disjoint union''' of this family is the set
: &lt;math&gt;
    \bigsqcup_{i\in I}A_i = \bigcup_{i\in I}\{(x,i) : x \in A_i\}.
  &lt;/math&gt;
The elements of the disjoint union are [[ordered pairs]] (''x'', ''i''). Here ''i'' serves as an auxiliary index that indicates which ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; the element ''x'' came from. 

Each of the sets ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is canonically isomorphic to the set
: &lt;math&gt;
    A_i^* = \{(x,i) : x \in A_i\}.
  &lt;/math&gt;
Through this isomorphism, one may consider that ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is canonically embedded in the disjoint union.
For ''i'' ≠ ''j'', the sets ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;* and ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;* are disjoint even if the sets ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; are not. 

In the extreme case where each of the ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is equal to some fixed set ''A'' for each ''i'' ∈ ''I'', the disjoint union is the [[Cartesian product]] of ''A'' and ''I'':
: &lt;math&gt;
    \bigsqcup_{i\in I}A_i = A \times I.
  &lt;/math&gt;

One may occasionally see the notation
: &lt;math&gt;
    \sum_{i\in I}A_i
  &lt;/math&gt;
for the disjoint union of a family of sets, or the notation ''A'' + ''B'' for the disjoint union of two sets. This notation is meant to be suggestive of the fact that the [[cardinality]] of the disjoint union is the [[summation|sum]] of the cardinalities of the terms in the family. Compare this to the notation for the [[Cartesian product]] of a family of sets. 

Disjoint unions are also sometimes written &lt;math&gt;\biguplus_{i\in I}A_i&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\ \cdot\!\!\!\!\!\bigcup_{i\in I}A_i&lt;/math&gt;.

In the language of [[category theory]], the disjoint union is the [[coproduct]] in the [[category of sets]]. It therefore satisfies the associated [[universal property]]. This also means that the disjoint union is the [[categorical dual]] of the [[Cartesian product]] construction. See [[coproduct]] for more details.

For many purposes, the particular choice of auxiliary index is unimportant, and in a simplifying [[abuse of notation]], the indexed family can be treated simply as a collection of sets. In this case &lt;math&gt;A_i^*&lt;/math&gt; is referred to as a ''copy'' of &lt;math&gt;A_i&lt;/math&gt; and the notation &lt;math&gt;\underset{A \in C}{\,\,\bigcup\nolimits^{*}\!} A&lt;/math&gt; is sometimes used.

==Category theory point of view==
In [[category theory]] the disjoint union is defined as a [[coproduct]] in the category of sets. 

As such, the disjoint union is defined up to an isomorphism, and the above definition is just one realization of the coproduct, among others. When the sets are pairwise disjoint, the usual union is another realization of the coproduct. This justifies the second definition in the lead.

This categorical aspect of the disjoint union explains why &lt;math&gt; \coprod&lt;/math&gt; is frequently used, instead of &lt;math&gt; \bigsqcup&lt;/math&gt;, to denote ''coproduct''.

In [[mathematics]], an '''equation''' is a statement of an [[equality (mathematics)|equality]] containing one or more [[variable (mathematics)|variables]]. [[Equation solving|''Solving'' the equation]] consists of determining which values of the variables make the equality true. Variables are also called '''unknowns''' and the values of the unknowns that satisfy the equality are called [[solution (equation)|solution]]s of the equation. There are two kinds of equations: [[identity (mathematics)|identities]] and conditional equations. An identity is true for all values of the variable. A conditional equation is true for only particular values of the variables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The most common type of equation is an [[algebraic equation]], in which the two sides are [[algebraic expression]]s.
Each side of an algebraic equation will contain one or more [[Addition#Notation and terminology|term]]s. For example, the equation	 
	
:&lt;math&gt; Ax^2 +Bx + C = y &lt;/math&gt;
	
has left-hand side &lt;math&gt; Ax^2 +Bx + C &lt;/math&gt;, which has three terms, and right-hand side &lt;math&gt; y &lt;/math&gt;, consisting of just one term. The unknowns are ''x'' and ''y'' and the parameters are ''A'', ''B'', and ''C''.

An equation is analogous to a scale into which weights are placed. When equal weights of something (grain for example) are placed into the two pans, the two weights cause the scale to be in balance and are said to be equal. If a quantity of grain is removed from one pan of the balance, an equal amount of grain must be removed from the other pan to keep the scale in balance. Likewise, to keep an equation in balance, the same operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division must be performed on both sides of an equation for it to remain true.

In [[geometry]], equations are used to describe [[geometric figures]]. As the equations that are considered, such as [[implicit equation]]s or [[parametric equation]]s, have infinitely many solutions, the objective is now different: instead of giving the solutions explicitly or counting them, which is impossible, one uses equations for studying properties of figures. This is the starting idea of [[algebraic geometry]], an important area of mathematics.

[[Algebra]] studies two main families of equations: [[polynomial equations]] and, among them, the special case of [[linear equations]]. When there is only one variable, polynomial equations have the form ''P''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, where ''P'' is a [[polynomial]], and linear equations have the form ''ax''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''b''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, where ''a'' and ''b'' are [[parameter#Mathematical functions|parameters]]. To solve equations from either family, one uses algorithmic or geometric techniques that originate from [[linear algebra]] or [[mathematical analysis]]. Algebra also studies [[Diophantine equations]] where the coefficients and solutions are [[integers]]. The techniques used are different and come from [[number theory]]. These equations are difficult in general; one often searches just to find the existence or absence of a solution, and, if they exist, to count the number of solutions.

[[Differential equations]] are equations that involve one or more functions and their derivatives. They are ''solved'' by finding an expression for the function that does not involve derivatives. Differential equations are used to model processes that involve the rates of change of the variable, and are used in areas such as physics, chemistry, biology, and economics.

The "[[=]]" symbol, which appears in every equation, was invented in 1557 by [[Robert Recorde]], who considered that nothing could be more equal than parallel straight lines with the same length.&lt;ref&gt;Recorde, Robert, ''The Whetstone of Witte'' … (London, England: Jhon Kyngstone, 1557), [https://archive.org/stream/TheWhetstoneOfWitte#page/n237/mode/2up the third page of the chapter "The rule of equation, commonly called Algebers Rule."]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
===Analogous illustration===

[[File:Equation illustration colour.svg|thumb|Illustration of a simple equation; ''x'', ''y'', ''z'' are real numbers, analogous to weights.]]

An equation is analogous to a [[weighing scale]], balance, or [[seesaw]].

Each side of the equation corresponds to one side of the balance. Different quantities can be placed on each side: if the weights on the two sides are equal, the scale balances, and in analogy the equality that represents the balance is also balanced (if not, then the lack of balance corresponds to an [[Inequality (mathematics)|inequality]] represented by an [[inequation]]).

In the illustration, ''x'', ''y'' and ''z'' are all different quantities (in this case [[real numbers]]) represented as circular weights, and each of ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' has a different weight. Addition corresponds to adding weight, while subtraction corresponds to removing weight from what is already there. When equality holds, the total weight on each side is the same.

===Parameters and unknowns===
{{see also|Expression (mathematics)}}
Equations often contain terms other than the unknowns. These other terms, which are assumed to be ''known'', are usually called ''constants'', ''coefficients'' or ''parameters''.

An example of an equation involving ''x'' and ''y'' as unknowns and the parameter ''R'' is

:&lt;math&gt; x^2 +y^2 = R^2 .&lt;/math&gt;

When ''R ''is chosen to have the value of 2 (''R ''= 2), this equation would be recognized, when sketched in [[Cartesian coordinates]], as the equation for a particular circle with a radius of 2. Hence, the equation with ''R'' unspecified is the general equation for the circle.

Usually, the unknowns are denoted by letters at the end of the alphabet, ''x'', ''y'', ''z'', ''w'', …, while coefficients (parameters) are denoted by letters at the beginning, ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d'', … . For example, the general [[quadratic equation]] is usually written ''ax''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''bx''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''c''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0. The process of finding the solutions, or, in case of parameters, expressing the unknowns in terms of the parameters is called [[Equation solving|solving the equation]]. Such expressions of the solutions in terms of the parameters are also called ''solutions''.

A [[system of equations]] is a set of ''simultaneous equations'', usually in several unknowns, for which the common solutions are sought. Thus a ''solution to the system'' is a set of values for each of the unknowns, which together form a solution to each equation in the system. For example, the system
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
3x+5y&amp;=2\\
5x+8y&amp;=3
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
has the unique solution ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−1, ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1.

===Identities===

{{main|Identity (mathematics)|List of trigonometric identities}}

An '''identity''' is an equation that is true for all possible values of the variable(s) it contains. Many identities are known in algebra and calculus. In the process of solving an equation, an identity is often used to simplify an equation making it more easily solvable.

In algebra, an example of an identity is the [[difference of two squares]]:

:&lt;math&gt;x^2 - y^2 = (x+y)(x-y) &lt;/math&gt;

which is true for all ''x'' and ''y''.

[[Trigonometry]] is an area where many identities exist; these are useful in manipulating or solving [[trigonometric equation]]s. Two of many that involve the [[sine function|sine]] and [[cosine function|cosine]] functions are:

:&lt;math&gt;\sin^2(\theta)+\cos^2(\theta) = 1 &lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\sin(2\theta)=2\sin(\theta) \cos(\theta) &lt;/math&gt;

which are both true for all values of ''θ''.

For example, to solve for the value of ''θ'' that satisfies the equation:

:&lt;math&gt;3\sin(\theta) \cos(\theta)= 1\,, &lt;/math&gt;

where ''θ'' is known to be limited to between 0 and 45 degrees, we may use the above identity for the product to give:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{3}{2}\sin(2 \theta) = 1\,,&lt;/math&gt;

yielding the solution for ''θ''

:&lt;math&gt;\theta = \frac{1}{2} \arcsin\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) \approx 20.9^\circ.&lt;/math&gt;

Since the sine function is a [[periodic function]], there are infinitely many solutions if there are no restrictions on ''θ''. In this example, the restriction that ''θ'' be between 0 and 45 degrees implies there is only one solution.

==Properties==

Two equations or two systems of equations are ''equivalent'' if they have the same set of solutions. The following operations transform an equation or a system of equations into an equivalent one – provided that the operations are meaningful for the expressions they are applied to:

* [[addition|Adding]] or [[subtraction|subtracting]] the same quantity to both sides of an equation. This shows that every equation is equivalent to an equation in which the right-hand side is zero.
* [[Multiplication|Multiplying]] or [[division (mathematics)|dividing]] both sides of an equation by a non-zero quantity.
* Applying an [[identity (mathematics)|identity]] to transform one side of the equation. For example, [[polynomial expansion|expanding]] a product or [[factorization of polynomials|factoring]] a sum.
* For a system: adding to both sides of an equation the corresponding side of another equation, multiplied by the same quantity.

If some [[function (mathematics)|function]] is applied to both sides of an equation, the resulting equation has the solutions of the initial equation among its solutions, but may have further solutions called [[extraneous solution]]s. For example, the equation &lt;math&gt;x=1&lt;/math&gt; has the solution &lt;math&gt;x=1.&lt;/math&gt; Raising both sides to the exponent of 2 (which means applying the function &lt;math&gt;f(s)=s^2&lt;/math&gt; to both sides of the equation) changes the equation to &lt;math&gt;x^2=1&lt;/math&gt;, which not only has the previous solution but also introduces the extraneous solution, &lt;math&gt;x=-1.&lt;/math&gt; Moreover, if the function is not defined at some values (such as 1/''x'', which is not defined for ''x'' = 0), solutions existing at those values may be lost. Thus, caution must be exercised when applying such a transformation to an equation.

The above transformations are the basis of most elementary methods for equation solving as well as some less elementary ones, like [[Gaussian elimination]].

{{details|Equation solving}}

==Algebra==

===Polynomial equations===
{{main|Polynomial equation}}

[[File:Polynomialdeg2.svg|thumb|right|220px|The ''solutions'' –1 and 2 of the ''polynomial equation'' {{nowrap|1=''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; – ''x'' + 2 = 0}} are the points where the [[graph of a function|graph]] of the [[quadratic function]] {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; – ''x'' + 2}} cuts the ''x''-axis.]]

In general, an ''algebraic equation'' or [[polynomial equation]] is an equation of the form

:&lt;math&gt;P = 0&lt;/math&gt;, or

:&lt;math&gt;P = Q&lt;/math&gt;

where ''P'' and ''Q'' are [[polynomial]]s with coefficients in some [[field (mathematics)|field]] (real numbers, complex numbers, etc.), which is often the field of the [[rational number]]s. An algebraic equation is ''univariate'' if it involves only one [[variable (mathematics)|variable]]. On the other hand, a polynomial equation may involve several variables, in which case it is called ''multivariate'' (multiple variables, x, y, z, etc.). The term ''polynomial equation'' is usually preferred to ''algebraic equation''.

For example,
:&lt;math&gt;x^5-3x+1=0&lt;/math&gt;
is a univariate algebraic (polynomial) equation with integer coefficients and
:&lt;math&gt;y^4+\frac{xy}{2}=\frac{x^3}{3}-xy^2+y^2-\frac{1}{7}&lt;/math&gt;
is a multivariate polynomial equation over the rational numbers.

Some but not all polynomial equations with [[Rational number|rational coefficients]] have a solution that is an [[algebraic expression]] with a finite number of operations involving just those coefficients (that is, it can be [[Algebraic solution|solved algebraically]]). This can be done for all such equations of [[Degree of a polynomial|degree]] one, two, three, or four; but for degree five or more it can be solved for some equations but, as the [[Abel–Ruffini theorem]] demonstrates, not for all. A large amount of research has been devoted to compute efficiently accurate approximations of the [[real number|real]] or [[complex number|complex]] solutions of a univariate algebraic equation (see [[Root-finding algorithm]]) and of the common solutions of several multivariate polynomial equations (see [[System of polynomial equations]]).

===Systems of linear equations===
[[File:九章算術.gif|thumb|[[The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art]] is an anonymous Chinese book proposing a method of resolution for linear equations.]]

A [[system of linear equations]] (or ''linear system'') is a collection of [[linear equation]]s involving the same set of [[variable (math)|variable]]s.&lt;ref&gt;The subject of this article is basic in mathematics, and is treated in a lot of textbooks. Among them, Lay 2005, Meyer 2001, and Strang 2005 contain the material of this article.&lt;/ref&gt; For example,
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{alignat}{7}
3x &amp;&amp;\; + \;&amp;&amp; 2y             &amp;&amp;\; - \;&amp;&amp; z  &amp;&amp;\; = \;&amp;&amp; 1 &amp; \\
2x &amp;&amp;\; - \;&amp;&amp; 2y             &amp;&amp;\; + \;&amp;&amp; 4z &amp;&amp;\; = \;&amp;&amp; -2 &amp; \\
-x &amp;&amp;\; + \;&amp;&amp; \tfrac{1}{2} y &amp;&amp;\; - \;&amp;&amp; z  &amp;&amp;\; = \;&amp;&amp; 0 &amp;
\end{alignat}&lt;/math&gt;
is a system of three equations in the three variables {{math|''x'', ''y'', ''z''}}. A '''solution''' to a linear system is an assignment of numbers to the variables such that all the equations are simultaneously satisfied. A [[Equation solving|solution]] to the system above is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{alignat}{2}
x &amp;\,=\,&amp; 1 \\
y &amp;\,=\,&amp; -2 \\
z &amp;\,=\,&amp; -2
\end{alignat}&lt;/math&gt;
since it makes all three equations valid. The word "''system''" indicates that the equations are to be considered collectively, rather than individually.

In mathematics, the theory of linear systems is the basis and a fundamental part of [[linear algebra]], a subject which is used in most parts of modern mathematics. Computational [[algorithm]]s for finding the solutions are an important part of [[numerical linear algebra]], and play a prominent role in [[physics]], [[engineering]], [[chemistry]], [[computer science]], and [[economics]]. A [[Nonlinear system|system of non-linear equations]] can often be [[approximation|approximated]] by a linear system (see [[linearization]]), a helpful technique when making a [[mathematical model]] or [[computer simulation]] of a relatively complex system.

==Geometry==

===Analytic geometry===
[[File:Coniques cone.png|thumb|A [[conic section]] is the intersection of a plane and a cone of revolution.]]
In [[Euclidean geometry]], it is possible to associate a set of coordinates to each point in space, for example by an orthogonal grid. This method allows one to characterize geometric figures by equations. A plane in three-dimensional space can be expressed as the solution set of an equation of the form &lt;math&gt; ax+by+cz+d=0&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;a,b,c&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; are real numbers and &lt;math&gt;x,y,z&lt;/math&gt; are the unknowns that correspond to the coordinates of a point in the system given by the orthogonal grid. The values &lt;math&gt;a,b,c&lt;/math&gt; are the coordinates of a vector perpendicular to the plane defined by the equation. A line is expressed as the intersection of two planes, that is as the solution set of a single linear equation with values in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt; or as the solution set of two linear equations with values in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^3.&lt;/math&gt;

A [[conic section]] is the intersection of a [[cone]] with equation &lt;math&gt;x^2+y^2=z^2&lt;/math&gt; and a plane. In other words, in space, all conics are defined as the solution set of an equation of a plane and of the equation of a cone just given. This formalism allows one to determine the positions and the properties of the focuses of a conic.

The use of equations allows one to call on a large area of mathematics to solve geometric questions. The [[Cartesian coordinate]] system transforms a geometric problem into an analysis problem, once the figures are transformed into equations; thus the name [[analytic geometry]]. This point of view, outlined by [[Descartes]], enriches and modifies the type of geometry conceived of by the ancient Greek mathematicians.

Currently, analytic geometry designates an active branch of mathematics. Although it still uses equations to characterize figures, it also uses other sophisticated techniques such as [[functional analysis]] and [[linear algebra]].

===Cartesian equations===
A [[Cartesian coordinate system]] is a [[coordinate system]] that specifies each [[point (geometry)|point]] uniquely in a [[plane (geometry)|plane]] by a pair of [[number|numerical]] '''coordinates''', which are the [[positive and negative numbers|signed]] distances from the point to two fixed [[perpendicular]] directed lines, that are marked using the same [[unit length|unit of length]].

One can use the same principle to specify the position of any point in three-[[dimension]]al [[space (mathematics)|space]] by the use of three Cartesian coordinates, which are the signed distances to three mutually perpendicular planes (or, equivalently, by its perpendicular projection onto three mutually perpendicular lines).

[[File:Cartesian-coordinate-system-with-circle.svg|thumb|right|250px|Cartesian coordinate system with a circle of radius 2 centered at the origin marked in red. The equation of a circle is {{nowrap|1=(''x'' − ''a'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + (''y'' − ''b'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} where ''a'' and ''b'' are the coordinates of the center {{nowrap|(''a'', ''b'')}} and ''r'' is the radius.]]

The invention of Cartesian coordinates in the 17th century by [[René Descartes]] ([[Latinisation (literature)|Latinized]] name: ''Cartesius'') revolutionized mathematics by providing the first systematic link between [[Euclidean geometry]] and [[algebra]]. Using the Cartesian coordinate system, geometric shapes (such as [[curve]]s) can be described by '''Cartesian equations''': algebraic equations involving the coordinates of the points lying on the shape. For example, a circle of radius 2 in a plane, centered on a particular point called the origin, may be described as the set of all points whose coordinates ''x'' and ''y'' satisfy the equation {{nowrap|1=''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 4}}.

===Parametric equations===
{{main|Parametric equation}}
A [[parametric equation]] for a [[curve]] expresses the [[coordinates]] of the points of the curve as functions of a [[variable (mathematics)|variable]], called a [[parameter]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, George B., and Finney, Ross L., ''Calculus and Analytic Geometry'', Addison Wesley Publishing Co., fifth edition, 1979, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weisstein, Eric W. "Parametric Equations." From MathWorld--A Wolfram Web Resource. http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ParametricEquations.html&lt;/ref&gt; For example,
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
x&amp;=\cos t\\
y&amp;=\sin t
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
are parametric equations for the [[unit circle]], where ''t'' is the parameter. Together, these equations are called a '''parametric representation''' of the curve.

The notion of ''parametric equation'' has been generalized to [[Surface (topology)|surface]]s, [[manifold]]s and [[algebraic variety|algebraic varieties]] of higher [[dimension of a manifold|dimension]], with the number of parameters being equal to the dimension of the manifold or variety, and the number of equations being equal to the dimension of the space in which the manifold or variety is considered (for curves the dimension is ''one'' and ''one'' parameter is used, for surfaces dimension ''two'' and ''two'' parameters, etc.).

==Number theory==

===Diophantine equations===
{{main|Diophantine equation}}
A '''Diophantine equation''' is a [[polynomial equation]] in two or more unknowns for which only the [[integer]] [[Zero of a function#Polynomial roots|solutions]] are sought (an integer solution is a solution such that all the unknowns take integer values). A '''linear Diophantine equation''' is an equation between two sums of [[monomials]] of [[Degree of a polynomial|degree]] zero or one. An example of '''linear Diophantine equation''' is {{math|''ax'' + ''by'' {{=}} ''c''}} where ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' are constants. An '''exponential Diophantine equation''' is one for which exponents of the terms of the equation can be unknowns.

'''Diophantine problems''' have fewer equations than unknown variables and involve finding integers that work correctly for all equations. In more technical language, they define an [[algebraic curve]], [[algebraic surface]], or more general object, and ask about the [[lattice point]]s on it.

The word ''Diophantine'' refers to the [[Greek mathematics#Hellenistic|Hellenistic mathematician]] of the 3rd century, [[Diophantus]] of [[Alexandria]], who made a study of such equations and was one of the first mathematicians to introduce [[Mathematical symbol|symbolism]] into [[algebra]]. The mathematical study of Diophantine problems that Diophantus initiated is now called '''Diophantine analysis'''.

===Algebraic and transcendental numbers===
{{main|Algebraic number|Transcendental number}}
An [[algebraic number]] is a number that is a solution of a non-zero [[polynomial equation]] in one variable with [[rational number|rational]] coefficients (or equivalently — by [[clearing denominators]] — with [[integer]] coefficients). Numbers such as [[Pi|{{pi}}]] that are not algebraic are said to be [[transcendental number|transcendental]]. [[Almost all]] [[real number|real]] and [[complex number|complex]] numbers are transcendental.

===Algebraic geometry===
{{main|Algebraic geometry}}
[[Algebraic geometry]] is a branch of [[mathematics]], classically studying solutions of [[polynomial equations]]. Modern algebraic geometry is based on more abstract techniques of [[abstract algebra]], especially [[commutative algebra]], with the language and the problems of [[geometry]].

The fundamental objects of study in algebraic geometry are [[algebraic variety|algebraic varieties]], which are geometric manifestations of [[solution set|solutions]] of [[systems of polynomial equations]]. Examples of the most studied classes of algebraic varieties are: [[plane algebraic curve]]s, which include [[line (geometry)|lines]], [[circle]]s, [[parabola]]s, [[ellipse]]s, [[hyperbola]]s, [[cubic curve]]s like [[elliptic curve]]s and quartic curves like [[lemniscate of Bernoulli|lemniscate]]s, and [[Cassini oval]]s. A point of the plane belongs to an algebraic curve if its coordinates satisfy a given polynomial equation. Basic questions involve the study of the points of special interest like the [[singular point of a curve|singular point]]s, the [[inflection point]]s and the [[point at infinity|points at infinity]]. More advanced questions involve the [[topology]] of the curve and relations between the curves given by different equations.

==Differential equations==
{{main|Differential equation}}
[[File:Attracteur étrange de Lorenz.png|thumb|uptight=1.2|A [[strange attractor]], which arises when solving a certain [[differential equation]].]]
A [[differential equation]] is a [[mathematics|mathematical]] equation that relates some [[function (mathematics)|function]] with its [[derivative]]s. In applications, the functions usually represent physical quantities, the derivatives represent their rates of change, and the equation defines a relationship between the two. Because such relations are extremely common, differential equations play a prominent role in many disciplines including [[physics]], [[engineering]], [[economics]], and [[biology]].

In [[pure mathematics]], differential equations are studied from several different perspectives, mostly concerned with their solutions — the set of functions that satisfy the equation. Only the simplest differential equations are solvable by explicit formulas; however, some properties of solutions of a given differential equation may be determined without finding their exact form.

If a self-contained formula for the solution is not available, the solution may be numerically approximated using computers. The theory of [[dynamical systems]] puts emphasis on qualitative analysis of systems described by differential equations, while many [[numerical methods]] have been developed to determine solutions with a given degree of accuracy.

===Ordinary differential equations===
{{main|Ordinary differential equation}}
An [[ordinary differential equation]] or '''ODE''' is an equation containing a function of one [[independent variable]] and its derivatives. The term "''ordinary''" is used in contrast with the term [[partial differential equation]], which may be with respect to ''more than'' one independent variable.

Linear differential equations, which have solutions that can be added and multiplied by coefficients, are well-defined and understood, and exact closed-form solutions are obtained. By contrast, ODEs that lack additive solutions are nonlinear, and solving them is far more intricate, as one can rarely represent them by [[elementary functions]] in closed form: Instead, exact and analytic solutions of ODEs are in series or integral form. Graphical and [[numerical ordinary differential equations|numerical]] methods, applied by hand or by computer, may approximate solutions of ODEs and perhaps yield useful information, often sufficing in the absence of exact, analytic solutions.

===Partial differential equations===
{{main|Partial differential equation}}
A [[partial differential equation]] ('''PDE''') is a [[differential equation]] that contains unknown [[Multivariable calculus|multivariable function]]s and their [[partial derivative]]s. (This is in contrast to [[ordinary differential equations]], which deal with functions of a single variable and their derivatives.) PDEs are used to formulate problems involving functions of several variables, and are either solved by hand, or used to create a relevant [[computer model]].

PDEs can be used to describe a wide variety of phenomena such as [[sound]], [[heat]], [[electrostatics]], [[electrodynamics]], [[fluid flow]], [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]], or [[quantum mechanics]]. These seemingly distinct physical phenomena can be formalised similarly in terms of PDEs. Just as ordinary differential equations often model one-dimensional [[dynamical systems]], partial differential equations often model [[multidimensional systems]]. PDEs find their generalisation in [[stochastic partial differential equations]].

== Types of equations ==
&lt;!--Linked from [[Simultaneous equations]]--&gt;

Equations can be classified according to the types of [[Operation (mathematics)|operations]] and quantities involved. Important types include:
* An [[algebraic equation]] or [[polynomial]] equation is an equation in which both sides are polynomials (see also [[system of polynomial equations]]). These are further classified by [[degree of a polynomial|degree]]:
** [[linear equation]] for degree one
** [[quadratic equation]] for degree two
** [[cubic equation]] for degree three
** [[quartic equation]] for degree four
** [[quintic equation]] for degree five
** [[sextic equation]] for degree six
** [[septic equation]] for degree seven
** [[octic equation]] for degree eight
* A [[Diophantine equation]] is an equation where the unknowns are required to be [[integer]]s
* A [[transcendental equation]] is an equation involving a [[transcendental function]] of its unknowns
* A [[parametric equation]] is an equation in which the solutions for the variables are expressed as functions of some other variables, called [[parameter]]s appearing in the equations
* A [[functional equation]] is an equation in which the unknowns are [[Function (mathematics)|functions]] rather than simple quantities
* A [[differential equation]] is a functional equation involving [[derivative]]s of the unknown functions
* An [[integral equation]] is a functional equation involving the [[antiderivative]]s of the unknown functions
* An [[integro-differential equation]] is a functional equation involving both the [[derivative]]s and the [[antiderivative]]s of the unknown functions
* A [[difference equation]] is an equation where the unknown is a function ''f'' that occurs in the equation through ''f''(''x''), ''f''(''x''−1), …, ''f''(''x''−''k''), for some whole integer ''k'' called the ''order'' of the equation. If ''x'' is restricted to be an integer, a difference equation is the same as a [[recurrence relation]]

{{Broader|Fraunhofer diffraction}}
In [[optics]], the '''Fraunhofer diffraction equation''' is used to model the [[diffraction]] of waves when the diffraction pattern is viewed at a long distance from the diffracting object, and also when it is viewed at the [[focal plane]] of an imaging [[Lens (optics)|lens]].&lt;ref&gt;Born &amp; Wolf, 1999, p 427.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins &amp; White, 1957, p 288&lt;/ref&gt;

The equation was named in honour of [[Joseph von Fraunhofer]] although he was not actually involved in the development of the theory.&lt;ref&gt;http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/biography/Fraunhofer.html&lt;/ref&gt;

This article gives the equation in various mathematical forms, and provides detailed calculations of the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern for several different forms of diffracting apertures, specially for normally incident monochromatic plane wave. A qualitative discussion of Fraunhofer diffraction can be found [[Fraunhofer diffraction|elsewhere]].

==Definition==

When a beam of light is partly blocked by an obstacle, some of the light is scattered around the object, and light and dark bands are often seen at  the edge of the shadow – this effect is known as diffraction.&lt;ref&gt;Heavens &amp; Ditchburn, 1996, p 62&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kirchhoff's diffraction formula|Kirchhoff diffraction equation]] provides an expression, derived from the [[wave equation]], which describes the wave diffracted by an aperture; analytical solutions to this equation are not available for most configurations.&lt;ref&gt;Born &amp; Wolf, 2002, p 425&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fraunhofer diffraction equation is an approximation  which can be applied when the diffracted wave is observed in the [[far field]], and also when a lens is used to focus the diffracted light; in many instances, a simple analytical solution is available to the Fraunhofer equation – several of these are derived below.

===In Cartesian co-ordinates===

[[File:Diffraction geometry 2.svg|thumb|250px|Diffraction geometry, showing aperture (or diffracting object) plane and image plane, with coordinate system.]] If the aperture is in {{math|''x'y'''}} plane, with the origin in the aperture and  is illuminated by a [[monochromatic]] wave, of [[wavelength]] λ, [[wavenumber]] {{math|''k''}} with [[complex amplitude]] {{math|''A''(''x'' ',''y'' ')}}, and the diffracted wave is observed in the {{math|''x,y,z''}} plane where {{math|''l'',''m''}} are the [[direction cosines]] of the point {{math|''x,y''}} with respect to the origin, the complex amplitude {{math|''U''(''x'',''y'')}} of the diffracted wave is given by the Fraunhofer diffraction equation as:&lt;ref&gt;Lipson et al., 2011, eq(8.8) p 231&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;U(x,y,z) \propto \iint_\text{Aperture} \,A(x',y') e^{-i \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}(lx' + my')} \, dx'\,dy'&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;U(x,y,z) \propto \iint_\text{Aperture} \,A(x',y') e^{-i k(lx' + my')} \, dx'\,dy'&lt;/math&gt;

It can be seen from this equation that the form of the diffraction pattern depends only on the direction of viewing, so the diffraction pattern changes in size but not in form with change of viewing distance.

The Fraunhofer diffraction equation can be expressed in a variety of mathematically equivalent forms.  For example:&lt;ref&gt;Hecht, 2002, eq (11.63), p 529&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;U(x,y,z) \propto \iint_\text{Aperture} \,A(x',y') e^{-i \frac{2\pi}{\lambda z}(x' x + y' y)}\,dx'\,dy'&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;U(x,y,z) \propto \iint_\text{Aperture} \,A(x',y') e^{-i \frac {k(x' x + y' y)}{z}}\,dx'\,dy'&lt;/math&gt;

It can be seen that the integral in the above equations is the [[Fourier transform]] of the aperture function evaluated at frequencies&lt;ref&gt;Hecht, 2002, eq(11.67), p 540&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; f_x=x/(\lambda z)=l/\lambda&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; f_y= y/(\lambda z)= m/\lambda&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, we can also write the equation in terms of a [[Fourier transform]] as:

:&lt;math&gt;U(x,y,z) \propto \hat f[A(x',y')]_{f_x f_y} &lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''Â''}} is the Fourier transform of {{math|''A''}}. The Fourier transform formulation can be very useful in solving diffraction problems.

Another form is:

:&lt;math&gt;U(\mathbf r)\propto { \int_\text{Aperture} A(\mathbf {r'}) e^{-i\mathbf{k} \cdot (\mathbf{r'} -\mathbf r)} dr'}= { \int_\text{Aperture} a_0 (\mathbf{r'}) e^{i\mathbf{(k_0-k)} \cdot (\mathbf{r'}-\mathbf r)} dr' }&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|'''r''' and '''r' '''}} represent the observation point and a point in the aperture respectively, {{math|'''k&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'''}} and {{math|'''k'''}} represent the [[wave vector]]s of the disturbance at the aperture and of the diffracted waves respectively, and {{math|a&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;('''r' ''')}} represents the [[Euclidean vector|magnitude]] of the disturbance at the aperture.

===In polar co-ordinates===

When the diffracting aperture has circular symmetry, it is useful to  use [[polar coordinate system|polar]] rather than [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian]] co-ordinates.&lt;ref&gt;Born &amp; Wolf, 2002, Section 8.5.2, eqs (6–8), p 439&lt;/ref&gt;

A point in the aperture has co-ordinates {{math|''ρ'',''ω''}} giving:

:&lt;math&gt;~x'=\rho' \cos \omega'; y'=\rho' \sin \omega'&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;~x=\rho \cos \omega; y=\rho \sin \omega&lt;/math&gt;

The complex amplitude at {{math|ρ'}} is given by {{math|A(ρ)}}, and the area {{math|d''x'' d''y''}} converts to [[Polar coordinate system#Generalization|''ρ''&amp;prime; d''ρ''&amp;prime; d''ω''&amp;prime;]], giving

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
U(\rho,\omega,z)
&amp;\propto \int_0^\infty \int_0^{2 \pi} A(\rho') e^{-i \frac{2\pi}{\lambda z}(\rho \rho' \cos \omega \cos \omega'  + \rho \rho' \sin \omega \sin \omega' )} \rho' d \rho' d \omega'\\
&amp;\propto \int_0^{2 \pi}  \int_0^\infty A(\rho') e^{-i \frac{2\pi}{\lambda z}\rho \rho' \cos (\omega - \omega') } \, d \omega' \rho' \, d \rho'
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Using the integral representation of the [[Bessel function]]:&lt;ref&gt;Abramowitz &amp; Stegun, 1964, Section 9.1.21, p 360&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;J_0(p)=\frac {1}{2 \pi} \int_0^{2 \pi} e^{ip \cos \alpha} \, d \alpha &lt;/math&gt;

we have

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
U(\rho,z)
&amp;\propto 2 \pi \int_0^\infty A(\rho') J_0\left(\frac{2 \pi \rho' \rho}{\lambda z} \right) \rho' \, d \rho'
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where the integration over {{math|ω}} gives {{math|2{{pi}}}} since the equation is circularly symmetric, i.e. there is no dependence on {{math|ω}}.

In this case, we have {{math|''U''(''ρ'',''z'')}} equal to the [[Hankel transform|Fourier–Bessel or Hankel transform]] of the aperture function, {{math|''A''(''ρ'')}}

==Example==

Here are given examples of Fraunhofer diffraction with a normally incident monochromatic plane wave.

In each case, the diffracting object is located in the ''z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 plane, and the complex amplitude of the incident [[plane wave]] is given by

:&lt;math&gt;~A(x',y')= a e^{i 2 \pi c t/\lambda} = a e^{ik c t}&lt;/math&gt;

where

:{{math|''a''}} is the [[Euclidean vector|magnitude]] of the wave disturbance,
:{{math|λ}} is the wavelength,
:{{math|''c''}} is the velocity of light,
:{{math|''t''}} is the time
:{{math|''k''}} = {{math|2 π/λ}} is the [[wave number]]

and the [[Phase (waves)|phase]] is zero at time {{math|''t''}} = 0.

The time dependent factor is omitted throughout the calculations, as it remains constant, and is averaged out when the [[Amplitude|intensity]] is calculated. The intensity at {{math|'''r'''}} is proportional to the amplitude times its [[complex conjugate]]
:&lt;math&gt;I(\mathbf{r}) \propto U(\mathbf{r}) \overline{U} (\mathbf{r})&lt;/math&gt;

These derivations can be found in most standard optics books, in slightly different forms using varying notations.  A reference is given for each of the systems modelled here. The Fourier transforms used can be found [[Fourier transforms#Tables of important Fourier transforms|here]].

===Slit of infinite depth===

[[File:Single Slit Diffraction (english).svg|right|thumb|Graph and image of single-slit diffraction]]The aperture is a slit of width {{math|''W''}} which is located along the {{math|''y''}}-axis,

;Solution by integration

Assuming the centre of the slit is located at {{math|''x '' [[=]] 0}}, the first equation above, for all values of {{math|''y''}}, is:&lt;ref&gt;Born &amp; Wolf, 1999, Section 8.5.1 p 436&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
U(x,z)
&amp;= a \int_ {-W/2}^{W/2} e^{  {-2 \pi ixx'}/(\lambda z)} \, dx'\\[4pt]
&amp;= -\frac{a \lambda z}{2 \pi i x} \left| e^{  {-2 \pi ixx'}/(\lambda z)} \right|_{-W/2}^{W/2}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Using [[Euler's formula]], this can be simplified to:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
U(x,z)
&amp;= aW \frac {\sin \left [\frac {\pi Wx} {\lambda z} \right ]} {\frac {\pi Wx} {\lambda z}}\\
&amp;= aW \operatorname{sinc} \frac {\pi Wx}{\lambda z}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|[[sinc]](''p'') {{=}} sin(''p'')/''p''}}. It should be noted that the [[sinc]] function is sometimes defined as {{math|sin({{pi}}''p'')/{{pi}}''p''}} and this may cause confusion when looking at derivations in different texts.

This can also be written as:

:&lt;math&gt;U(\theta) = aW \operatorname {sinc} \left [\frac {\pi  W \sin \theta} {\lambda} \right]&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''θ''}} is the angle between ''z''-axis and the line joining x to the origin and {{math|sin ''θ'' ≈ ''x''/''z''}} when {{math|''θ'' &lt;&lt; 1}}.

;Fourier transform solution

The slit can be represented by the [[rect]] function as:&lt;ref&gt;Hecht, 2002, p 540&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;~\operatorname{rect}\left( \frac x W \right)&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Fourier transform#Square-integrable functions|Fourier transform]] of this function is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\hat f(\operatorname{rect}(ax)) = \displaystyle \frac 1 {|a|} \cdot \operatorname{sinc}\left(\frac \xi a \right)&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|ξ}} is the Fourier transform frequency,  and the {{math|sinc}} function is here defined as sin(''{{pi}}x'')/(''{{pi}}x'')

The Fourier transform frequency here is {{math|''x''/''λz''}}, giving

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
U(x,z)
&amp;\propto  \frac {\sin{ \frac {\pi Wx} {\lambda z}}}{ \frac {\pi Wx} {\lambda z}}\\
&amp;\propto  W \operatorname{sinc} { \frac {\pi Wx} {\lambda z}}\\
&amp; \propto W \operatorname{sinc} { \frac { \pi W \sin \theta} {\lambda }} \\
&amp; \propto W \operatorname{sinc} (kW \sin \theta /2)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the {{math|sinc}} function is here defined as sin(''x'')/(''x'') to maintain consistency.

;Intensity

The [[Intensity (physics)|intensity]] is proportional to the square of the amplitude, and is then&lt;ref&gt;Hecht, 2002, eqs (10.17) (10.18), p 453&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{align}
I(\theta) 
&amp;\propto \operatorname{sinc}^2 \left [\frac {  \pi W \sin \theta} \lambda \right]\\
&amp;\propto \operatorname{sinc}^2 \left [\frac {kW \sin \theta} 2 \right]
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Apertures==

===Rectangular aperture===

[[File:rectangular diffraction.jpg|right|200px|thumbnail|Computer simulation of Fraunhofer diffraction by a rectangular aperture]]When a slit of width ''W'' and height ''H'' is illuminated normally by a [[monochromatic]] [[plane wave]] of wavelength λ, the complex amplitude can be found using similar analyses to those in the previous section, applied over two independent dimensions as:&lt;ref&gt;Longhurst, 1967, p 217&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, eq(4.28), p 76&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
U(\theta, \phi) 
&amp;\propto \operatorname{sinc}\left(\frac{ \pi W  \sin\theta}{\lambda}\right)\operatorname{sinc}\left(\frac{ \pi H \sin\phi}{\lambda}\right)\\
&amp;\propto \operatorname{sinc}\left(\frac{ k W  \sin\theta}{2}\right)\operatorname{sinc}\left(\frac{  kH \sin\phi}{2}\right)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The intensity is given by

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
I(\theta, \phi)
&amp; \propto \operatorname{sinc}^2\left(\frac{\pi W \sin\theta}{\lambda}\right)\operatorname{sinc}^2\left(\frac{ \pi H \sin\phi}{\lambda}\right)\\
&amp; \propto \operatorname{sinc}^2\left(\frac{k W \sin\theta}{2}\right)\operatorname{sinc}^2\left(\frac{k H \sin\phi}{2}\right)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|θ}} and {{math|φ}} are the angles between the {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''z''}} axes and the {{math|''y''}} and {{math|''z''}} axes, respectively.

In practice, all slits are of finite length and will therefore produce diffraction on both directions.  If the length of the slit is much greater than its width, then the spacing of the horizontal diffraction fringes will be much less than the spacing of the vertical fringes.  If the illuminating beam does not illuminate the whole length of the slit, the spacing of the horizontal fringes is determined by the dimensions of the laser beam.  Close examination of the two-slit pattern below shows that there are very fine horizontal diffraction fringes above and below the main spot, as well as the more obvious vertical fringes.

===Circular aperture===
[[File:Airy-pattern.svg|thumb|400px|right|Airy diffraction pattern]]The aperture has diameter {{math|''W''}}. The complex amplitude in the observation plane is given by

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
U(\rho,z)&amp;=2 \pi a \int_0^{W/2} J_0\left( \frac{2\pi\rho'\rho}{\lambda z}\right) \rho' \, d \rho'
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

;Solution by integration

Using the recurrence relationship&lt;ref&gt;Whittaker and Watson,  example 2, p 360&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {d} {dx} \left[x^{n+1}J_{n+1}(x) \right] =x^{n+1}J_n(x)&lt;/math&gt;

to give

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^x x'J_0(x') \, dx'=xJ_1(x)&lt;/math&gt;

If we substitute
:&lt;math&gt;x'= \frac{2 \pi \rho}{\lambda z} \rho'&lt;/math&gt;

and the limits of the integration become 0 and {{math|πρW/λz}}, we get

:&lt;math&gt;U(\rho,z) \propto  \frac{J_1(\pi W \rho/ \lambda z)}{\pi W \rho / \lambda z}&lt;/math&gt;

Putting {{math|ρ/''z''}} = sin&amp;nbsp;{{math|θ}}, we get

:&lt;math&gt;U(\theta) \propto  \frac{J_1(\pi W \sin \theta/ \lambda)}{\pi W \sin \theta / \lambda}&lt;/math&gt;

;Solution using Fourier–Bessel transform

We can write the aperture function as a [[step function]]

:&lt;math&gt;~\Pi (W/2)&lt;/math&gt;

The Fourier–Bessel transform for this function is given by the relationship

:&lt;math&gt;~F[\Pi(r/a)] = \frac {2 \pi J_1 (qa)} {q} &lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|q/2π}} is the transform frequency which is equal to {{math|ρ/λ''z''}} and {{math|''a''}} = {{math|''W''/2}}.

Thus, we get  
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
U(\rho)
&amp;=  \frac {2 \pi J_1(\pi W \rho / \lambda z)}{2 \pi W \rho/\lambda z}\\
&amp;= \frac { 2 \pi J_1(\pi W \sin \theta /\lambda)}{W \sin \theta/\lambda}\\
&amp;=\frac { 2 \pi J_1(k W \sin \theta /2)}{ kW \sin \theta/2}

\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

;Intensity

The intensity is given by:&lt;ref&gt;Hecht, 2002, eq (10.56), p 469&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
I(\theta) 
&amp;\propto  \left [\frac{J_1(\pi W \sin \theta/ \lambda)}{\pi W \sin \theta/\lambda)} \right]^2\\
&amp;\propto  \left [\frac{J_1(k W \sin \theta/2)}{(k W \sin \theta/2)} \right]^2
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

====Form of the diffraction pattern====

This known as the [[Airy disk|Airy diffraction pattern]]

The diffracted pattern is symmetric about the normal axis.

===Aperture with a Gaussian profile===

[[File:Gaussian profile.svg|thumb|Intensity of a plane wave diffracted through an aperture with a Gaussian profile]]An aperture with a Gaussian profile, for example, a photographic slide whose transmission has a Gaussian variation, so that the amplitude at a point in the aperture located at a distance ''r''' from the origin is given by

:&lt;math&gt;A(\rho') =  \exp{\left( - \left [ \frac {\rho'} {\sigma} \right]^2 \right )}&lt;/math&gt;

giving

:&lt;math&gt;
U(\rho,z)=2 \pi a \int_0^\infty \exp{ \left (  - \left [\frac {\rho'} {\sigma} \right]^2 \right ) } J_0(2 \pi \rho' \rho/\lambda z) \rho' \, d \rho'
&lt;/math&gt;

;Solution using Fourier–Bessel transform

The [[Hankel transform|Fourier–Bessel or Hankel]] transform is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;
F_\nu(k) = \int_0^\infty f(r)J_\nu(kr)\,r\,dr
&lt;/math&gt;
where ''J''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;nu;&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Bessel function]] of the first kind of order &amp;nu; with &amp;nu;&amp;nbsp;&amp;ge;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1/2.

The [[Hankel transform#Some Hankel transform pairs|Hankel transform]] is

:&lt;math&gt;F_\nu [e^{(ar)^2/2}] = \frac {e^{-k^2/2a^2}}{a^2}&lt;/math&gt;

giving

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
U(\rho,z) 
&amp;\propto e^{-[\frac{\pi \rho \sigma}{\lambda z}]^2}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
and 
:&lt;math&gt; U(\theta) \propto e^{-[\frac{\pi \sigma \sin \theta}{\lambda}]^2}&lt;/math&gt;

;Intensity

The intensity is given by:&lt;ref&gt;Hecht, 2002, eq (11.2), p 521&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; I(\theta) \propto e^{-[\frac{2\pi \sigma \sin \theta}{\lambda}]}&lt;/math&gt;

This function is plotted on the right, and it can be seen that, unlike the diffraction patterns produced by rectangular or circular apertures, it has no secondary rings.  This can be used in a process called [[apodization]] - the aperture is covered by a filter whose transmission varies as a Gaussian function, giving a diffraction pattern with no secondary rings.:&lt;ref&gt;Heavens &amp; Ditchburn, 1991, p 68&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hecht, 2002, Figure (11.33), p 543&lt;/ref&gt;

==Slits==

===Two slits===
The pattern which occurs when light diffracted from two slits overlaps is of considerable interest in physics, firstly for its importance in establishing the wave theory of light through [[Young's interference experiment]], and secondly because of its role as a thought experiment in [[double-slit experiment]] in quantum mechanics.

====Narrow slits====
[[File:Two slit diagram3.svg|thumb|Geometry of two slit diffraction]][[File:Laserdiffraction.jpg|right|thumb|Two slit interference using a red laser]]Assume we have two long slits illuminated by a plane wave of wavelength {{math|λ}}. The slits are in the {{math|''z'' {{=}} 0}} plane, parallel to the {{math|''y''}} axis, separated by a distance {{math|''S''}} and are symmetrical about the origin. The width of the slits is small compared with the wavelength.

;Solution by integration

The incident light is diffracted by the slits into uniform spherical waves.  The  waves travelling in a given direction {{math|θ}} from the two slits have differing phases.  The phase of the waves from the upper and lower slits relative to the origin is given by {{math|(2π/λ)(S/2)sin θ}} and {{math|-(2π/λ)(S/2)sin θ}}

The complex amplitude of the summed waves is given by:&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins &amp; White, 1957, eq (16c), p 312&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
U(\theta) 
&amp;= a e^{\frac { i\pi S \sin \theta }{\lambda}} + a e^{- \frac {  i \pi S \sin \theta} {\lambda}}\\
&amp;=a (\cos {\frac { \pi S \sin \theta }{\lambda}} +i \sin {\frac { \pi S \sin \theta }{\lambda}} )+a (\cos {\frac { \pi S \sin \theta }{\lambda}} -i \sin {\frac { \pi S \sin \theta }{\lambda}} )\\
&amp;=2a \cos {\frac { \pi S \sin \theta }{\lambda}}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

;Solution using Fourier transform

The aperture can be represented by the function:&lt;ref&gt;Hecht, 2002, eq (11.4328), p 5&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;~a[\delta {(x-S/2)}+ \delta {(x+S/2)}]&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|δ}} is the [[Dirac delta function|delta function]].

:&lt;math&gt;\hat {f}[\delta (x)] =1&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\hat {f} [g(x-a)] = e^{-2 \pi i a f_x} \hat {f} [g(x)]&lt;/math&gt;

giving

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
U(x,z)
&amp;=\hat {f} [\delta {(x-S/2)}+ \delta {(x+S/2)}]\\
&amp;= e^{- i \pi Sx/2 \lambda }+e^{ i \pi Sx/2 \lambda}\\
&amp;= 2 \cos \frac {\pi S x}{2 \lambda}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;U(\theta)= 2 \cos \frac {\pi S \sin \theta} {2 \lambda}&lt;/math&gt;

This is the same expression as that derived above by integration.

;Intensity

This gives the intensity of the combined waves as:&lt;ref&gt;Lipson et al., 2011, eq (9.3), p 280&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{align}
I(\theta)
&amp; \propto \cos^2 \left[\frac { \pi S \sin \theta}{\lambda} \right]\\
&amp; \propto \cos^2 {\left[ \frac {kS \sin \theta}{2}\right]}

\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Slits of finite width===

[[File:Single slit and double slit3.jpg|thumb|Single and double slit diffraction – slit separation is 0.7mm and the slit width is 0.1mm]] The width of the slits, {{math|''W''}} is finite.

;Solution by integration

The diffracted pattern is given by:&lt;ref&gt;Hecht, 2002, Section 10.2.2, p 451&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
U(\theta)
&amp;= a \left [e^{\frac { i\pi S \sin \theta }{\lambda}} +  e^{- \frac {  i \pi S \sin \theta} {\lambda}} \right]\int_ {-W/2}^{W/2} e^{  {-2 \pi ix' \sin \theta}/(\lambda)} \, dx'\\
&amp;= 2a \cos {\frac { \pi S \sin \theta }{\lambda}} W \operatorname{sinc} \frac { \pi W \sin \theta}{\lambda}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

;Solution using Fourier transform

The aperture function is given by:&lt;ref&gt;Hecht, 2002, p 541&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;a \left[\operatorname {rect} \left (\frac{x-S/2}{W} \right) + \operatorname {rect} \left (\frac{x+S/2}{W} \right) \right]&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Fourier transform#Square-integrable functions|Fourier transform]] of this function is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\hat f(\operatorname{rect}(ax)) = \displaystyle \frac 1 {|a|}\cdot \operatorname{sinc}\left(\frac{\xi}{a}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|ξ}} is the Fourier transform frequency,  and the {{math|sinc}} function is here defined as sin(''πx'')/(''πx'')

and

:&lt;math&gt;\hat {f} [g(x-a)] = e^{-2 \pi i a f_x} \hat {f} [g(x)]&lt;/math&gt;

We have

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
U(x,z)
&amp;= \hat {f} \left [a \left[\operatorname {rect} \left (\frac{x-S/2}{W} \right) + \operatorname {rect} \left (\frac{x+S/2}{W} \right) \right ] \right ]\\
&amp;= 2W \left[ e^{- i \pi Sx/\lambda z}+e^{ i \pi Sx/\lambda z} \right] \frac {\sin { \frac {\pi Wx} {\lambda z}}}{ \frac {\pi Wx} {\lambda z}}\\
&amp;= 2a \cos {\frac { \pi S x }{\lambda z}} W \operatorname{sinc} \frac { \pi Wx}{\lambda z}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

or

: &lt;math&gt;U(\theta)= 2a \cos {\frac { \pi S \sin \theta } \lambda} W  \operatorname{sinc} \frac { \pi W \sin \theta} \lambda&lt;/math&gt;

This is the same expression as was derived by integration.

;Intensity

The intensity is given by:&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins and White, 1967, eq (16c), p 313&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{align}
I(\theta)
&amp;\propto  \cos^2 \left [ \frac {\pi S \sin \theta} \lambda \right] \operatorname{sinc}^2 \left [ \frac {\pi W \sin \theta}\lambda \right]\\
&amp;\propto \cos^2 \left [\frac{k S \sin \theta} 2 \right] \operatorname{sinc}^2 \left [ \frac {kW \sin \theta}{2} \right]
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

It can be seen that the form of the intensity pattern is the product of the individual slit diffraction pattern, and the interference pattern which would be obtained with slits of negligible width.  This is illustrated in the image at the right which shows single slit diffraction by a laser beam, and also the diffraction/interference pattern given by two identical slits.

==Gratings==

A grating is defined in Born and Wolf as "any arrangement which imposes on an incident wave a periodic variation of amplitude or phase, or both".&lt;ref&gt;Born &amp; Wolf, 1999, Section 8.6.1, p 446&lt;/ref&gt;

===Narrow slit grating===

A simple grating consists of a screen with N slits whose width is significantly less than the wavelength of the incident light with slit separation of {{math|''S''}}.

;Solution by integration

The complex amplitude of the diffracted wave at an angle {{math|θ}} is given by:&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins &amp; White, 1957, eq (17a), p 330&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
U(\theta)
&amp;= a\sum_{n=1}^N e^{ \frac {-i 2 \pi nS \sin \theta} {\lambda}}\\
&amp;= \frac {1-e^{ -i 2 \pi NS \sin \theta/\lambda}} {1-e^{-i 2 \pi S \sin \theta / \lambda}}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

since this is the sum of a [[Geometric series#Formula|geometric series]].

;Solution using Fourier transform

The aperture is given by

:&lt;math&gt; \sum _{n=0}^{N} \delta(x-nS) &lt;/math&gt;

The Fourier transform of this function is:&lt;ref&gt;Lipson et al., 2011, eq(4.41), p 106&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\hat {f} \left[\sum _{n=0}^{N} \delta(x-nS) \right]
&amp;=\sum _{n=0}^{N} e^{-i f_x nS}\\
&amp;= \frac {1-e^{ -i 2 \pi NS \sin \theta/\lambda}} {1-e^{-i 2 \pi S \sin \theta / \lambda}}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

;Intensity

[[File:Grating50.svg|thumb|200px|right|Diffraction pattern for 50 narrow-slit grating]][[File:Grating20and 50.svg|thumb|200px|right|Detail of main maximum in 20 and 50 narrow slit grating diffraction patterns]]The intensity is given by:&lt;ref&gt;Born &amp; Wolf, 1999, eq(5a), p 448&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
I(\theta) 
&amp;\propto \frac {1 - \cos (2 \pi N S\sin \theta/\lambda)}{1-\cos (2 \pi S \sin \theta / \lambda)}\\
&amp;\propto \frac{ \sin^2 (\pi N S \sin \theta/\lambda)}{ \sin^2 (\pi S \sin \theta/\lambda)}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

This function has a series of maxima and minima.  There are regularly spaced "principal maxima", and a number of much smaller maxima in between the principal maxima.  The principal maxima occur when

:&lt;math&gt;\pi S \sin_n \theta/\lambda =n \pi, n = 0, \pm 1, \pm 2,\ldots &lt;/math&gt;

and the main diffracted beams therefore occur at angles:

:&lt;math&gt;\sin \theta_n = \frac {n \lambda} {S}, n=0, \pm 1 \pm 2, \ldots&lt;/math&gt;

This is the [[grating equation]] for normally incident light.

The number of small intermediate maxima is equal to the number of slits, {{math|''N''}}&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 and their size and shape is also determined by {{math|''N''}}.

The form of the pattern for {{math|''N''}}=50 is shown in the first figure .

The detailed structure for 20 and 50 slits gratings are illustrated in the second diagram.

===Finite width slit grating===

[[File:gratingwide.svg|thumb|200px|right|Diffraction pattern from grating with finite width slits]]The grating now has ''N'' slits of width {{math|''W''}} and  spacing {{math|''S}}

;Solution using integration

The amplitude is given by:&lt;ref&gt;Born &amp; Wolf, Section 8.6.1, eq (5), p 448&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
U(\theta, \phi) 
&amp;\propto a\sum_{n=1}^N e^{ \frac {-i 2 \pi nS \sin \theta} \lambda}\int_{-W/2}^{W/2} e^{  {-2 \pi ixx'}/(\lambda z)} \,dx' \\
&amp;\propto a\operatorname{sinc}\left(\frac{ W \sin\theta}{\lambda}\right)\frac {1-e^{ -i 2 \pi NS \sin \theta/\lambda}} {1-e^{-i 2 \pi S \sin \theta / \lambda}}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

;Solution using Fourier transform

The aperture function can be written as:&lt;ref&gt;Hecht, The array theorem, p 543&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^N \operatorname {rect} \left[ \frac {x'-nS} W \right] &lt;/math&gt;

Using the [[Fourier transform#Convolution theorem|convolution theorem]], which says that if we have two functions {{math|''f''(''x'')}} and {{math|''g''(''x'')}}, and we have

:&lt;math&gt;h(x) = (f*g)(x) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty f(y)g(x - y)\,dy,&lt;/math&gt;

where ∗ denotes the convolution operation, then we also have

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{h}(\xi) =  \hat{f}(\xi)\cdot \hat{g}(\xi).&lt;/math&gt;

we can write the aperture function as

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname {rect} (x'/W)* \sum_{n=0}^N \delta (x'-nS)&lt;/math&gt;

The amplitude is then given by the Fourier transform of this expression as:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
U(x,z)
&amp;=\hat {f} [\operatorname {rect} (x'/W)] \hat {f} \left[ \sum_{n=0}^N \delta (x'-nS) \right]\\
&amp;=a\operatorname{sinc}\left(\frac{ W \sin\theta} \lambda \right)\frac {1-e^{ -i 2 \pi NS \sin \theta/\lambda}} {1-e^{-i 2 \pi S \sin \theta / \lambda}}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

;Intensity

The intensity is given by:&lt;ref&gt;Born &amp; Wolf, 2002, Section 8.6, eq (10), p 451&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
I(\theta)
&amp; \propto\operatorname{sinc}^2\left(\frac{ W \sin\theta}{\lambda}\right)\frac{ \sin^2 (\pi N S \sin \theta/\lambda)}{ \sin^2 (\pi S \sin \theta/\lambda)}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The diagram shows the diffraction pattern for a grating with 20 slits, where the width of the slits is 1/5th of the slit separation.  The size of the main diffracted peaks is modulated with the diffraction pattern of the individual slits.

===Other gratings===

The Fourier transform method above can be used to find the form of the diffraction for any periodic structure where the Fourier transform of the structure is known. Goodman&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, 2005, Sections 4.4.3 and 4.4.4, p 78&lt;/ref&gt; uses this method to derive expressions for the diffraction pattern obtained with sinusoidal amplitude and phase modulation gratings.  These are of particular interest in [[holography]].

==Extensions==
===Non-normal illumination===

If the aperture is illuminated by a mono-chromatic plane wave incident in a direction {{math|(''l''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, the first version of the Fraunhofer equation above becomes:&lt;ref&gt;Lipson et al., 2011, Section 8.2.2, p 232&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
U(x,y,z) 
&amp;\propto \iint_\text{Aperture} \,A(x',y') e^{-i \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}[(l-l_0)x' + (m-m_0)y']} \, dx'\,dy'\\
&amp;\propto \iint_\text{Aperture} \,A(x',y') e^{-i k[(l-l_0)x' + (m-m_0)y']}\,dx'\,dy'
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
 
The equations used to model each of the systems above are altered only by changes in the constants multiplying {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}}, so the diffracted light patterns will have the form, except that they will now be centred around the direction of the incident plane wave.

The grating equation becomes&lt;ref&gt;Born &amp; Wolf, 1999, eq (8), p 449&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sin \theta_n = \frac {n \lambda} {S} + \sin \theta_0, n=0, \pm1, \pm2, \ldots&lt;/math&gt;

===Non-monochromatic illumination===

In all of the above examples of Fraunhofer diffraction, the effect of increasing the wavelength of the illuminating light is to reduce the size of the diffraction structure, and conversely, when the wavelength is reduced, the size of the pattern increases.  If the light is not mono-chromatic, i.e. it consists of a range of different wavelengths, each wavelength is diffracted into a pattern of a slightly different size to its neighbours.  If the spread of wavelengths is significantly smaller than the mean wavelength, the individual patterns will vary very little in size, and so the basic diffraction will still appear with slightly reduced contrast. As the spread of wavelengths is increased, the number of "fringes" which can be observed is reduced.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2469">In [[computer science]] and [[mathematics]], a '''full employment theorem''' is a theorem which states that no algorithm can optimally perform a particular task done by some class of professionals. The name arises because such a theorem ensures that there is endless scope to keep discovering new techniques to improve the way at least some specific task is done.

For example, the ''full employment theorem for compiler writers'' states that there is no such thing as a provably perfect size-optimizing compiler, as such a proof for the compiler would have to [[halting problem|detect non-terminating computations]] and reduce them to a one-instruction [[infinite loop]]. Thus, the existence of a provably perfect size-optimizing compiler would imply a solution to the [[halting problem]], which cannot exist, making the proof itself an [[undecidable problem]].  This also implies that there may always be a better compiler since the proof that one has the best compiler cannot exist.  Therefore, compiler writers will always be able to speculate that they have something to improve. Similarly, [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]] have been called full employment theorems for mathematicians. In [[theoretical computer science]] this field of study is known as [[Kolmogorov complexity]], or the smallest program which outputs a given string.

Tasks such as [[computer virus|virus]] writing and detection, and [[Spam (electronic)|spam]] filtering and filter-breaking are also subject to [[Rice's theorem]].

==Additional examples==
*[[No free lunch in search and optimization]] - no efficient general-purpose solver can exist, and hence there will always be some particular problem whose best known solution might be improved.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4868">In [[algebraic geometry]], a '''action of a group scheme''' is a generalization of a [[group action]] to a [[group scheme]]. Precisely, given a group ''S''-scheme ''G'', a '''left action of ''G'' on an ''S''-scheme ''X''''' is an ''S''-morphism
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma: G \times_S X \to X&lt;/math&gt;
such that
* (associativity) &lt;math&gt;\sigma \circ (1_G \times \sigma) = \sigma \circ (m \times 1_X)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;m: G \times_S G \to G&lt;/math&gt; is the group law,
* (unitality) &lt;math&gt;\sigma \circ (e \times 1_X) = 1_X&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;e: S \to G&lt;/math&gt; is the identity section of ''G''.

A '''right action of ''G'' on ''X''''' is defined analogously. A scheme equipped with a left or right action of a group scheme ''G'' is called a '''''G''-scheme'''. An [[equivariant morphism]] between ''G''-schemes is a [[morphism of schemes]] that intertwines the respective ''G''-actions.

More generally, one can also consider (at least some special case of) an action of a [[group functor]]: viewing ''G'' as a functor, an action is given as a natural transformation satisfying the conditions analogous to the above.&lt;ref&gt;In details, given a group-scheme action &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, for each morphism &lt;math&gt;T \to S&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; determines a group action &lt;math&gt;G(T) \times X(T) \to X(T)&lt;/math&gt;; i.e., the group &lt;math&gt;G(T)&lt;/math&gt; acts on the set of ''T''-points &lt;math&gt;X(T)&lt;/math&gt;. Conversely, if for each &lt;math&gt;T \to S&lt;/math&gt;, there is a group action &lt;math&gt;\sigma_T: G(T) \times X(T) \to X(T)&lt;/math&gt; and if those actions are compatible; i.e., they form a [[natural transformation]], then, by the [[Yoneda lemma]], they determine a group-scheme action &lt;math&gt;\sigma: G \times_S X \to X&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, some authors study group action in the language of a [[groupoid]]; a group-scheme action is then an example of a [[groupoid scheme]].

== Constructs ==
The usual constructs for a [[group action]] such as orbits generalize to a group-scheme action. Let &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; be a given group-scheme action as above.

*Given a T-valued point &lt;math&gt;x: T \to X&lt;/math&gt;, the [[orbit map]] &lt;math&gt;\sigma_x: G \times_S T \to X \times_S T&lt;/math&gt; is given as &lt;math&gt;(\sigma \circ (1_G \times x), p_2)&lt;/math&gt;.
*The [[orbit (group theory)|orbit]] of ''x'' is the image of the orbit map &lt;math&gt;\sigma_x&lt;/math&gt;.
*The [[Stabilizer subgroup|stabilizer]] of ''x'' is the [[scheme-theoretic fiber|fiber]] over &lt;math&gt;\sigma_x&lt;/math&gt; of the map &lt;math&gt;(x, 1_T): T \to X \times_S T.&lt;/math&gt;

== Problem of constructing a quotient ==
{{expand section|date=June 2018}}
Unlike a set-theoretic group action, there is no straightforward way to construct a quotient for a group-scheme action. One exception is the case when the action is free, the case of a [[principal fiber bundle]].

There are several approaches to overcome this difficulty:
*[[Level structure (algebraic geometry)|Level structure]] - Perhaps the oldest, the approach replaces an object to classify by an object together with a level structure
*[[Geometric invariant theory]] - throw away bad orbits and then take a quotient. The drawback is that there is no canonical way to introduce the notion of "bad orbits"; the notion depends on a choice of [[linearization]]. See also: [[categorical quotient]], [[GIT quotient]].
*[[Borel construction]] - this is an approach essentially from algebraic topology; this approach requires one to work with an [[infinite-dimensional space]].
*Analytic approach, the theory of [[Teichmüller space]]
*[[Quotient stack]] - in a sense, this is the ultimate answer to the problem. Roughly, a "quotient prestack" is the category of orbits and one [[stackification|stackify]] (i.e., the introduction of the notion of a torsor) it to get a quotient stack.

Depending on applications, another apppraoch would be to shift the focus away from a space then onto stuff on a space; e.g., [[topos]]. So the problem shifts from the classification of orbits to that of [[equivariant object]]s.&lt;!--=== Linear representations of a group scheme ===
Loosely, a linear representation of a group scheme is a family of linear [[group representation]]s. Precisely, given a vector bundle &lt;math&gt;E \to S&lt;/math&gt; over a scheme ''S'' of finite type over a field ''k'',--&gt;

In [[combinatorics|combinatorial mathematics]], the '''hook-length formula''' is a formula for the number of [[Young tableau|standard Young tableaux]] whose shape is a given [[Young diagram]].
It has applications in diverse [[areas of mathematics|areas]] such as [[representation theory]], [[probability theory|probability]], and [[algorithm analysis]]; for example, the problem of [[longest increasing subsequence]]s.

== Definitions and statement ==

Let &lt;math&gt;\lambda=(\lambda_1,\ldots,\lambda_m)&lt;/math&gt; be a [[partition (number theory)|partition]] of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.
It is customary to interpret &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; graphically as a [[Young diagram]], namely a left-justified array of square cells with &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; rows and &lt;math&gt;\lambda_i&lt;/math&gt; cells in the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;th row for each &lt;math&gt;1\le i\le m&lt;/math&gt;.
A [[Young tableau|standard Young tableau]] of shape &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is a Young diagram of shape &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; in which each of the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; cells contains a distinct integer between 1 and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; (i.e., no repetition), such that each row and each column form increasing [[sequence]]s.
For each cell of the Young diagram in coordinates &lt;math&gt;(i,j)&lt;/math&gt; (that is, the cell in the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;th row and &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;th column), the '''hook''' &lt;math&gt;H_\lambda(i,j)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[set (mathematics)|set]] of cells &lt;math&gt;(a,b)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;a=i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b \ge j&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;a \ge i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b=j&lt;/math&gt;.
The hook-length &lt;math&gt;h_\lambda(i,j)&lt;/math&gt; is the number of cells in the hook &lt;math&gt;H_\lambda(i,j)&lt;/math&gt;.

Then the hook-length formula expresses the number of standard Young tableaux of shape &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, sometimes denoted by &lt;math&gt;d_\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, as
:&lt;math&gt; d_\lambda = \frac{n!}{\prod h_\lambda (i,j)} , &lt;/math&gt;
where the product is over all cells &lt;math&gt;(i,j)&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;.

== Example ==
[[File:Hook-length tableau December 8 2013 3.jpg|thumb|right|A tableau listing the hook length of each cell in the Young diagram &lt;br /&gt; &lt;math&gt;(4, 3, 1, 1)&lt;/math&gt;]]
The figure on the right shows hook-lengths for all cells in the [[Young diagram]] {{math|''λ''}} of the partition &lt;br /&gt; 9 = 4 + 3 + 1 + 1. Then the number of standard [[Young tableaux]] &lt;math&gt;d_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; for this Young diagram can be computed as
:&lt;math&gt;d_\lambda = \frac{9!}{7\cdot 5\cdot 4\cdot 3\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 1\cdot 1\cdot 1} = 216.&lt;/math&gt;

== History ==

There are other formulas for &lt;math&gt;d_\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, but the hook-length formula is particularly simple and elegant.
The hook-length formula was discovered in 1954 by J. S. Frame, [[Gilbert de Beauregard Robinson|G. de B. Robinson]], and R. M. Thrall by improving a less convenient formula expressing &lt;math&gt;d_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; in terms of a [[determinant]].

Can. J. Math. 6, 316–325.&lt;/ref&gt;
This earlier formula was deduced independently by [[Ferdinand Georg Frobenius|G. Frobenius]] and [[Alfred Young|A. Young]] in 1900 and 1902 respectively using algebraic methods.
&lt;ref&gt;G. Frobenius. Uber die charaktere der symmetrischer gruppe, Preuss. &amp;ad. Wk. sitz. (1900), 516–534.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;A. Young. Quantitative substitutional analysis II, Proc. London Math. Sot., Ser. 1, 35 (1902), 361–397.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Percy Alexander MacMahon|P. A. MacMahon]] found an alternate proof for the Young–Frobenius formula in 1916 using difference methods.
&lt;ref&gt;P. A. MacMahon. “Combinatory Analysis,” Cambridge Univ. Press, London/New York, 1916; reprinted by Chelsea, New York, 1960.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the simplicity of the hook-length formula, the Frame–Robinson–Thrall proof is uninsightful and does not provide an intuitive argument as to why hooks appear in the formula.
The search for a short, intuitive explanation befitting such a simple result gave rise to many alternate proofs for the hook-length formula.
&lt;ref&gt;Knuth, Donald (1973). The Art of Computer Programming, Volume 3: Sorting and Searching, 3rd Edition, Addison–Wesley, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;
A. P. Hillman and R. M. Grassl gave the first proof that illuminates the role of hooks in 1976 by proving a special case of the [[Richard P. Stanley|Stanley]] hook-content formula, which is known to imply the hook-length formula.
&lt;ref&gt;A. P. Hillman and R. M. Grassl. Reverse plane partitions and tableau hook numbers, J. Comb. Theory, Ser. A 21 (1976), 216–221.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Curtis Greene|C. Greene]], [[Albert Nijenhuis|A. Nijenhuis]], and [[Herbert S. Wilf|H. S. Wilf]] found a probabilistic proof using the hook walk in which the hook lengths appear naturally in 1979.

of Young tableaux of a given shape. Adv. in Math. 31, 104–109.&lt;/ref&gt;
J. B. Remmel adapted the original Frame–Robinson–Thrall proof into the first bijective proof for the hook-length formula in 1982.

Multilinear Algebra 11 (1982), 45–100.&lt;/ref&gt;
A direct bijective proof was first discovered by D. S. Franzblau and [[Doron Zeilberger|D. Zeilberger]] in 1982.

[[Doron Zeilberger|D. Zeilberger]] also converted the Greene–Nijenhuis–Wilf hook walk proof into a bijective proof in 1984.

A simpler direct bijective proof was announced by [[Igor Pak]] and Alexander V. Stoyanovskii in 1992, and its complete proof was presented by the pair and Jean-Christophe Novelli in 1997.

Meanwhile, the hook-length formula has been generalized in several ways.

== Proofs ==

=== Knuth's heuristic argument ===

The hook-length formula can be understood intuitively using the following heuristic, but incorrect, argument suggested by [[Donald Knuth|D. E. Knuth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Art of Computer Programming, Volume 3: Sorting and Searching, 3rd Edition|first=Donald|last=Knuth|publisher=Addison–Wesley|year=1973|isbn=0-201-03803-X|page=63}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Given that each element of a tableau is the smallest in its hook and filling the tableau shape at random, the probability that cell &lt;math&gt;(i,j)&lt;/math&gt; will contain the minimum element of the corresponding hook is the reciprocal of the hook length.  Multiplying these probabilities over all &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; gives the formula. This argument is fallacious since the events are not independent.

Knuth's argument is however correct for the enumeration of labellings on trees satisfying monotonicity properties analogous to those of a Young tableau. In this case, the 'hook' events in question are in fact independent events.

=== Probabilistic proof using the hook walk ===

This is a probabilistic proof found by  [[Curtis Greene|C. Greene]], [[Albert Nijenhuis|A. Nijenhuis]], and [[Herbert S. Wilf|H. S. Wilf]] in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;Greene, C., Nijenhuis, A. and Wilf, H. S. (1979). A probabilistic proof of a formula for the number of Young tableaux of a given shape. Adv. in Math. 31, 104–109.&lt;/ref&gt; Here is a sketch of the proof. Define

: &lt;math&gt;e_\lambda = \frac{n!}{\prod_{(i,j)\in Y(\lambda)}h_\lambda(i,j)}.&lt;/math&gt;

we would like to show that &lt;math&gt;d_\lambda = e_\lambda&lt;/math&gt;. The first observation about &lt;math&gt;d_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is

: &lt;math&gt;d_\lambda = \sum_{\mu\uparrow\lambda}d_\mu, &lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Corners of young.png|thumbnail|right|Corners of the Young diagram (5,3,2,1,1)]]
where &lt;math&gt;\mu\uparrow\lambda&lt;/math&gt; denotes that &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; are Young tableau obtained from &lt;math&gt; \lambda &lt;/math&gt; by deleting one corner cell from &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;. The sum is taken over all such &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;. Here we are taking the convention that &lt;math&gt;d_{\phi}=1&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; denotes the empty diagram. The explanation for the above equation is that the maximal entry of the Young tableau of shape &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; occurs at one of its corner cells. By deleting that cell we will obtain a Young tableau of shape &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;. Since the number of Young tableau of shape &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;d_{\mu}&lt;/math&gt;, taking the sum over all such &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; we get the equation.

Notice that we also have &lt;math&gt;e_{\phi}=1&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, it is enough to show that

: &lt;math&gt;e_\lambda = \sum_{\mu\uparrow\lambda}e_\mu,&lt;/math&gt;

and the result &lt;math&gt;d_\lambda=e_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; then follows by induction. The above sum can also be viewed as a sum of probabilities by rewriting the equation to be shown as

: &lt;math&gt; \sum_{\mu\uparrow\lambda}\frac{e_\mu}{e_\lambda}=1.&lt;/math&gt;

We therefore need to show that the numbers &lt;math&gt;\frac{e_\mu}{e_\lambda}&lt;/math&gt; define a probability measure on the set of Young diagrams &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;\mu\uparrow\lambda&lt;/math&gt;). This is done in a constructive way by defining a random walk, called the '''hook walk''', on the cells of the Young diagram &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, which eventually selects one of the corner cells of &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; (which are in bijection with diagrams &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; for which &lt;math&gt;\mu\uparrow\lambda&lt;/math&gt;). The hook walk is defined by the following rules.

(1) Pick a cell uniformly at random from &lt;math&gt;|\lambda|&lt;/math&gt; cells. Start the random walk from there.

(2) Successor of current cell &lt;math&gt;(i,j)&lt;/math&gt; is chosen uniformly at random from the hook &lt;math&gt;H_{\lambda}(i,j)\setminus \{(i,j)\}&lt;/math&gt;.

(3) Continue until you reach at one of the corner cells, call it &lt;math&gt;\textbf{c}&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Proposition:''' For any corner cell &lt;math&gt;(a,b)&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; we have

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{P}\left(\textbf{c}=(a,b)\right)=\frac{e_\mu}{e_\lambda},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mu=\lambda\setminus\{(a,b)\}&lt;/math&gt;.

Once we have the above proposition, taking the sum over all possible corner cells &lt;math&gt;\textbf{c}=(a,b)&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt; \sum_{\mu\uparrow\lambda}\frac{e_{\mu}}{e_{\lambda}}=1&lt;/math&gt;, as claimed.

== Connection to representation theory ==

The hook-length formula is of great importance in the representation theory of the [[symmetric group]] &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt;, where the number &lt;math&gt;d_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is known to be equal to the dimension of the complex irreducible representation &lt;math&gt;V_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; associated to &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, and is frequently denoted by &lt;math&gt;\dim V_\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\dim \lambda&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;f^\lambda&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Detailed discussion ===
The complex irreducible representations &lt;math&gt; V_{\lambda} &lt;/math&gt; of the symmetric group are indexed by partitions &lt;math&gt; \lambda &lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt; n &lt;/math&gt; (for an explicit construction see [[Specht module]]) . Their characters are related to the theory of symmetric functions via the Hall inner product in the following formula

: &lt;math&gt; \chi^\lambda(w)=\langle s_\lambda, p_{\tau(w)}\rangle &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; s_{\lambda} &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Schur polynomial|Schur function]] associated to &lt;math&gt; \lambda &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; p_{\tau(w)} &lt;/math&gt; is the power-sum symmetric function of the partition &lt;math&gt; \tau(w) &lt;/math&gt; associated to the cycle decomposition of &lt;math&gt; w &lt;/math&gt;. For example, if &lt;math&gt; w=(154)(238)(6)(79) &lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt; \tau(w) = (3,3,2,1) &lt;/math&gt;.

Since the identity permutation &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; has the form &lt;math&gt; e=(1)(2)\cdots(n) &lt;/math&gt; in cycle notation, &lt;math&gt; \tau(e) = 1+1+\cdots+1=1^{(n)} &lt;/math&gt;. Then the formula says

:&lt;math&gt; \dim  V_\lambda =\chi^\lambda(e) = \langle s_\lambda, p_{1^{(n)}}\rangle &lt;/math&gt;

Considering the expansion of Schur functions in terms of [[monomial symmetric function]]s using the [[Kostka number]]s

:&lt;math&gt;  s_\lambda= \sum_\mu K_{\lambda\mu}m_\mu,&lt;/math&gt;

the inner product with &lt;math&gt; p_{1^{(n)}} = h_{1^{(n)}} &lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;  K_{\lambda 1^{(n)}} &lt;/math&gt;, because &lt;math&gt;  \langle m_{\mu},h_{\nu} \rangle = \delta_{\mu\nu} &lt;/math&gt;. Note that &lt;math&gt; K_{\lambda 1^{(n)}}  &lt;/math&gt; is equal to &lt;math&gt; d_{\lambda} &lt;/math&gt;. Hence

:&lt;math&gt; \dim V_\lambda = d_\lambda. &lt;/math&gt;

An immediate consequence of this is 
:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{\lambda\vdash n} \left(f^{\lambda}\right)^2 = n! &lt;/math&gt;
The above equality is also a simple consequence of the [[Robinson–Schensted–Knuth correspondence]].

The computation also shows that:

: &lt;math&gt; (x_1+x_2+\cdots+x_k)^n = \sum_{\lambda\vdash n} s_\lambda f^\lambda. &lt;/math&gt;

Which is the expansion of &lt;math&gt;  p_{1^{(n)}} &lt;/math&gt; in terms of Schur functions using the coefficients given by the inner product, because &lt;math&gt; \langle s_{\mu},s_{\nu}\rangle = \delta_{\mu\nu}  &lt;/math&gt;.
The above equality can be proven also checking the coefficients of each monomial at both sides and using the [[Robinson–Schensted–Knuth correspondence]] or, more conceptually, looking at the decomposition of &lt;math&gt;V^{\otimes n} &lt;/math&gt; by irreducible &lt;math&gt;  GL(V) &lt;/math&gt; modules, and taking characters. See [[Schur–Weyl duality]].

=== Outline of the proof of the hook formula using Frobenius formula===

By the above considerations
:&lt;math&gt; p_{1^{(n)}} =  \sum_{\lambda\vdash n} s_{\lambda}f^{\lambda} &lt;/math&gt;
So that 
:&lt;math&gt; \Delta(x)p_{1^{(n)}} = \sum_{\lambda\vdash n} \Delta(x)s_{\lambda}f^{\lambda} &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;  \Delta(x) = \prod_{i&lt;j} (x_i-x_j)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Vandermonde determinant]].

For a given partition &lt;math&gt; \lambda = (\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \cdots, \lambda_k) &lt;/math&gt; define &lt;math&gt; l_i = \lambda_i+k-i &lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt; i=1,2,\cdots,k &lt;/math&gt;. For the following we need at least as many variables as rows in the partition, so from now on we work with &lt;math&gt;n &lt;/math&gt; variables &lt;math&gt;x_1,\cdots,x_n&lt;/math&gt;.

Each term &lt;math&gt; \Delta(x)s_{\lambda}  &lt;/math&gt; is equal to
:&lt;math&gt; a_{(\lambda_1+k-1, \lambda_2+k-2, \dots , \lambda_k)} (x_1, x_2, \dots , x_k) =
\det \left[ \begin{matrix} x_1^{l_1} &amp; x_2^{l_1} &amp; \dots &amp; x_k^{l_1} \\
x_1^{l_2} &amp; x_2^{l_2} &amp; \dots &amp; x_k^{l_2} \\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
x_1^{l_k} &amp; x_2^{l_k} &amp; \dots &amp; x_k^{l_k} \end{matrix} \right]
&lt;/math&gt;

See [[Schur polynomial|Schur function]]. Since the vector &lt;math&gt; (l_1,l_2,\cdots, l_k) &lt;/math&gt; is different for each partition, this means that the coefficient of &lt;math&gt;  x_1^{l_1}\cdots x_k^{l_k} &lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\Delta(x)p_{1^{(n)}}&lt;/math&gt;, denoted &lt;math&gt;\left[\Delta(x)p_{1^{(n)}}\right]_{l_1,\cdots,l_k}&lt;/math&gt;, is equal to &lt;math&gt; f^{\lambda} &lt;/math&gt;. This is known as the [[Frobenius formula|Frobenius Character Formula]], which gives one of the earliest proofs.&lt;ref&gt;W. Fulton, J. Harris. Representation Theory: A First Course Springer-Verlag
, New York, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;
All that remains is tracking that coefficient with a mixture of cleverness and brute force: Multiplying

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta(x) = \sum_{w\in S_n}  \sgn(w) x_1^{w(1)-1}x_2^{w(2)-1}\cdots x_k^{w(k)-1} &lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt; p_{1^{(n)}} = (x_1+x_2+\cdots+x_k)^n = \sum \frac{n!}{d_1!d_2!\cdots d_k!} x_1^{d_1}x_2^{d_2}\cdots x_k^{d_k} &lt;/math&gt;

we conclude that the coefficient that we are looking for is

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{w\in S_n} \sgn(w)\frac{n!}{(l_1-w(1)+1)!(l_2-w(2)+1)!\cdots (l_k-w(k)+1)!} &lt;/math&gt;

which can be written as

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{n!}{l_1!l_2!\cdots l_k!} \sum_{w\in S_n} \sgn(w)\left[(l_1)(l_1-1)\cdots(l_1-w(1)+2)\right] \left[(l_2)(l_2-1)\cdots(l_2-w(2)+2)\right]\left[(l_k)(l_k-1)\cdots(l_k-w(k)+2)\right] &lt;/math&gt;

The latter sum is equal to the following determinant

:&lt;math&gt; \det \left[ \begin{matrix} 1 &amp; l_1 &amp; l_1(l_1-1) &amp; \dots &amp; \prod_{i=0}^{k-2} (l_1-i) \\
1 &amp; l_2 &amp; l_2(l_2-1) &amp; \dots &amp; \prod_{i=0}^{k-2} (l_2-i)\\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots&amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
1 &amp; l_k &amp; l_k(l_k-1) &amp; \dots &amp; \prod_{i=0}^{k-2} (l_k-i) \end{matrix} \right] &lt;/math&gt;

which column reduces to the Vandermonde determinant, and we obtain the formula

:&lt;math&gt; d_\lambda = \frac{n!}{l_1!l_2!\cdots l_k!} \prod_{i&lt;j} (l_i-l_j) &lt;/math&gt;

Note that &lt;math&gt; l_i &lt;/math&gt; is the hook length of the first box in each row of the Young Diagram. Transforming this expression into the form &lt;math&gt; \frac{n!}{\prod h_\lambda (i,j)} &lt;/math&gt; claimed by the hook-length formula is a fairly simple exercise in combinatorics: For any given &lt;math&gt; i = 1, 2, \ldots, k &lt;/math&gt;, one has to argue that &lt;math&gt; l_i! = \left(\prod_{j &gt; i} (l_i - l_j)\right) \cdot \prod_c h_\lambda(c) &lt;/math&gt;, where the latter product ranges over all cells &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; in the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-row of the Young diagram of &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;.

== Connection to longest increasing subsequences ==

The hook length formula also has important applications to the analysis of [[longest increasing subsequence]]s in random permutations. If &lt;math&gt;\sigma_n&lt;/math&gt; denotes a uniformly random permutation of order &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;L(\sigma_n)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the maximal length of an increasing subsequence of &lt;math&gt;\sigma_n&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\ell_n&lt;/math&gt; denotes the expected (average) value of &lt;math&gt;L(\sigma_n)&lt;/math&gt;, Anatoly Vershik and Sergei Kerov &lt;ref&gt;Vershik, A. M.; Kerov, C. V. (1977), "Asymptotics of the Plancheral measure of the symmetric group and a limiting form for Young tableaux", Dokl. Akad. Nauk SSSR 233: 1024–1027&lt;/ref&gt; and independently Benjamin F. Logan and Lawrence A. Shepp &lt;ref&gt;B. F. Logan and L. A. Shepp, A variational problem for random Young tableaux, Advances in Math. 26 (1977), no. 2, 206–222.&lt;/ref&gt; showed that when &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is large, &lt;math&gt;\ell_n&lt;/math&gt; is approximately equal to &lt;math&gt;2 \sqrt{n}&lt;/math&gt;. This answers a question originally posed by [[Stanislaw Ulam]]. The proof is based on translating the question via the [[Robinson–Schensted correspondence]] to a problem about the limiting shape of a random Young tableau chosen according to [[Plancherel measure]]. Since the definition of Plancherel measure involves the quantity &lt;math&gt;d_\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, the hook length formula can then be used to perform an asymptotic analysis of the limit shape and thereby also answer the original question.

The ideas of Vershik–Kerov and Logan–Shepp were later refined by Jinho Baik, Percy Deift and Kurt Johansson, who were able to achieve a much more precise analysis of the limiting behavior of the maximal increasing subsequence length, proving an important result now known as the Baik–Deift–Johansson theorem. Their analysis again makes crucial use of the fact that &lt;math&gt;d_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; has a number of good formulas, although instead of the hook length formula it made use of one of the determinantal expressions.

== Related formulas ==
The formula for the number of Young tableau of a given shape was originally derived from the [[Frobenius determinant theorem|Frobenius determinant formula]] in connection to representation theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1 = Knuth| first1 = Donald|publisher = Addison–Wesley|year= 1973|authorlink=Donald Ervin Knuth|edition=1|title = [[The Art of Computer Programming]]|volume=3|pages=61–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If the shape of a Young diagram is given by the row lengths &lt;math&gt;n_1,\dots,n_m&lt;/math&gt;, then the number of tableau with that shape is given by
:&lt;math&gt; f(n_1,n_2,\ldots,n_m) = \frac{n! \,\Delta(n_m,n_{m-1}+1,\ldots,n_1 + m - 1)}{n_m ! (n_{m-1} + 1)! \cdots (n_1 + m - 1)!}&lt;/math&gt;

Hook lengths can also be used to give a product representation to the generating function for the number of reverse plane partitions of a given shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | authorlink=Richard P. Stanley | last1=Stanley | first1=Richard P. | title=Theory and applications of plane partitions, 2 | year=1971 | journal=[[Studies in Applied Mathematics]] | volume=50 | pages=259–279}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If {{mvar|''λ''}} is a partition of some integer {{mvar|''p''}}, a reverse plane partition of {{mvar|''n''}} with shape {{mvar|''λ''}} is obtained by filling in the boxes in the Young diagram with non-negative integers such that the entries add to {{mvar|''n''}} and are non-decreasing along each row and down each column.  The hook lengths &lt;math&gt; h_1,\dots,h_p &lt;/math&gt; can be defined as with Young tableau.  If {{math|''π''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} denotes the number of reverse plane partitions of {{mvar|''n''}} with shape {{mvar|''λ''}}, then the generating function can be written as
:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{n=0}^\infty \pi_n x^n = \prod_{k=1}^p (1-x^{h_k})^{-1} &lt;/math&gt;

Stanley discovered another formula for the same generating function.&lt;ref&gt;R.P. Stanley, "Ordered Structures and Partitions" PhD Thesis, Harvard University, 1971&lt;/ref&gt; In general, if &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt; is any poset with &lt;math&gt; n &lt;/math&gt; elements, the generating function for reverse &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt;-partitions is 
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{P(x)}{(1-x)(1-x^2)\cdots(1-x^n)} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; P(x)  &lt;/math&gt; is a polynomial such that &lt;math&gt;P(1)&lt;/math&gt; is the number of natural labelings of &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt;.

In the case of a partition &lt;math&gt; \lambda &lt;/math&gt;, we are considering the poset in its cells given by the relation 
:&lt;math&gt; (i,j) \leq (i',j') \iff i\leq i' \qquad \textrm{and} \qquad j\leq j'&lt;/math&gt;. 
So a natural labeling is simply a standard Young tableau, i.e. &lt;math&gt; P(1) = f^{\lambda} &lt;/math&gt;

===Yet another proof of the hook length formula===

Combining the two formulas for the generating functions we have
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{P(x)}{(1-x)(1-x^2)\cdots(1-x^n)}  = \prod_{(i,j)\in \lambda} (1-x^{h_{(i,j)}})^{-1} &lt;/math&gt;

Both sides converge inside the disk of radius one and the following expression makes sense for &lt;math&gt; |x| &lt; 1 &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; P(x) = \frac{\prod_{k=1}^n (1-x^k)}{\prod_{(i,j)\in \lambda} (1-x^{h_{(i,j)}})}. &lt;/math&gt;

It would be violent to plug in 1, but the right hand side is a continuous function inside the unit disk and a polynomial is continuous everywhere so at least we can say

:&lt;math&gt; P(1) = \lim_{x\to 1} \frac{\prod_{k=1}^n (1-x^k)}{\prod_{(i,j)\in \lambda} (1-x^{h_{(i,j)}})}.   &lt;/math&gt;

Finally, applying L'Hopital's rule &lt;math&gt; n &lt;/math&gt; times yields the hook length formula

:&lt;math&gt; P(1) = \frac{n!}{\prod_{(i,j)\in \lambda}h_{(i,j)}}. &lt;/math&gt;

==Specialization of Schur functions==

Specializing the schur functions to the variables &lt;math&gt; 1,t,t^2,t^3, \cdots &lt;/math&gt; there is the formula
:&lt;math&gt; s_{\lambda}(1,t,t^2,\cdots) = \frac{t^{n\left( \lambda\right)}}{\prod_{(i,j)\in Y(\lambda)}(1-t^{h_{\lambda}(i,j)})}  &lt;/math&gt;

The number &lt;math&gt; n(\lambda) &lt;/math&gt; is defined as 
:&lt;math&gt; n(\lambda) = \sum_i (i-1)\lambda_i = \sum_i \binom{\lambda_i'}{2} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \lambda' &lt;/math&gt; is the conjugate partition

===Skew shape formula===

There is a generalization of this formula for skew shapes,
&lt;ref&gt;
Morales, A. H., Pak, I., and Panova, G.
Hook formulas for skew shapes,
arXiv:1512.08348.
&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; s_{\lambda/\mu}(1,t,t^2,\cdots) = \sum_{S \in E(\lambda/\mu)} \prod_{(i,j) \in \lambda\setminus S} \frac{t^{\lambda_j'-i}}{1-t^{h(i,j)}}  &lt;/math&gt;
where the sum is taken over ''excited diagrams'' of shape &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; and boxes distributed according to &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;.

== A formula for the Catalan numbers ==

The [[Catalan number]]s are ubiquitous in [[enumerative combinatorics]]. Not surprisingly, they are also part of this story:
:&lt;math&gt; C_n = f^{(n,n)} &lt;/math&gt;

Lets briefly mention why.  When doing a Dyck path we may go up (U) or down (D). So for any Dyck path of length &lt;math&gt; n &lt;/math&gt; consider the tableaux of shape &lt;math&gt; (n,n) &lt;/math&gt; such that the first row is given by the numbers &lt;math&gt; i &lt;/math&gt; such that the &lt;math&gt; i &lt;/math&gt;-th step was up and in the second row given by the positions in which it goes down. For example, UUDDUD correspond to the tableaux with rows 125 and 346.

The hook formula gives another way of getting a closed formula for the Catalan numbers

:&lt;math&gt; C_n = \frac{(2n)!}{(n+1)(n)\cdots(3)(2)(n)(n-1)\cdots(2)(1)} = \frac{(2n)!}{(n+1)!n!} = \frac{1}{n+1}\binom{2n}{n}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Sir Isaac Newton''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|PRS|FRS}} (25 December 1642&amp;nbsp;– 20 March [[Old Style and New Style dates|1726/27]]&lt;!-- This is the generally accepted manner of recording Newton's death date. Please do not change without discussion. --&gt;&lt;ref name="OSNS"/&gt;) was an English [[Mathematics|mathematician]], [[Astronomy|astronomer]], [[theologian]], [[author]] and [[Physics|physicist]] (described in his own day as a "[[natural philosophy|natural philosopher]]") who is widely recognised as one of the most influential scientists of all time, and a key figure in the [[scientific revolution]].  His book ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'' ("Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy"), first published in 1687, laid the foundations of [[classical mechanics]].  Newton also made seminal contributions to [[optics]], and shares credit with [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] for developing the infinitesimal [[calculus]].

In ''Principia'', Newton formulated the [[Newton's laws of motion|laws of motion]] and [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|universal gravitation]] that formed the dominant scientific viewpoint until it was superseded by the [[theory of relativity]]. Newton used his mathematical description of [[gravity]] to prove [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion]], account for [[tide]]s, the [[Trajectory|trajectories]] of [[comet]]s, the [[Axial precession|precession of the equinoxes]] and other phenomena, eradicating doubt about the [[Solar System]]'s [[heliocentrism|heliocentricity]]. He demonstrated that the [[Dynamics (mechanics)|motion of objects]] on [[Earth]] and [[Astronomical object|celestial bodies]] could be accounted for by the [[celestial mechanics|same principles]]. Newton's inference that the Earth is an [[Spheroid#Oblate spheroids|oblate spheroid]] was later confirmed by the geodetic measurements of [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis|Maupertuis]], [[Charles Marie de La Condamine|La Condamine]], and others, convincing most European scientists of the superiority of Newtonian mechanics over earlier systems.

Newton built the [[Newtonian telescope|first practical reflecting telescope]] and developed a sophisticated theory of colour based on the observation that a [[Dispersive prism|prism]] separates [[Electromagnetic spectrum#Visible radiation (light)|white light]] into the colours of the [[visible spectrum]]. His work on light was collected in his highly influential book ''[[Opticks]]'', published in 1704. He also formulated an [[Newton's law of cooling|empirical law of cooling]], made the first theoretical calculation of the [[speed of sound]], and introduced the notion of a [[Newtonian fluid]].  In addition to his work on calculus, as a mathematician Newton contributed to the study of power series, generalised the [[binomial theorem]] to non-integer exponents, developed [[Newton's method|a method]] for approximating the [[Zero of a function|roots of a function]], and classified most of the [[cubic plane curve]]s.

Newton was a fellow of [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]] and the second [[Lucasian Professor of Mathematics]] at the [[University of Cambridge]].  He was a devout, but unorthodox, Christian who privately rejected the doctrine of the [[Trinity]]. Unusually for a member of the Cambridge faculty of the day, he refused to take [[holy orders]] in the [[Church of England]].  Beyond his work on the mathematical sciences, Newton dedicated much of his time to the study of [[alchemy]] and [[Chronology of the Bible|biblical chronology]], but most of his work in those areas remained unpublished until long after his death.  Politically and personally tied to the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig party]], Newton served two brief terms as [[Cambridge University (UK Parliament constituency)|Member of Parliament for the University of Cambridge]], in 1689–90 and 1701–02.  He was [[knight]]ed by [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] in 1705 and spent the last three decades of his life in London, serving as [[Warden of the Mint|Warden]] (1696–1700) and [[Master of the Mint|Master]] (1700–1727) of the [[Royal Mint]], as well as president of the [[Royal Society]] (1703–1727).

==Life==

===Early life===
{{Main|Early life of Isaac Newton}}

Isaac Newton was born (according to the [[Julian calendar]], in use in England at the time) on Christmas Day, 25 December 1642 ([[Old Style and New Style dates|NS]] 4 January 1643&lt;ref name="OSNS"/&gt;) "an hour or two after midnight",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Isaac Newton, horoscope for birth date 25 December 1642 Jul.Cal|url=http://www.astro.com/astro-databank/Newton,_Isaac|website=Astro-Databank Wiki|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Woolsthorpe Manor]] in [[Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth]], a [[Hamlet (place)|hamlet]] in the county of Lincolnshire. His father, also named Isaac Newton, had died three months before. [[premature birth|Born prematurely]], Newton was a small child; his mother Hannah Ayscough reportedly said that he could have fit inside a [[quart]] mug.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Storr|first1=Anthony|title=Isaac Newton|journal=British Medical Journal (Clinical Research Edition)|date=December 1985|volume=291|issue=6511|pages=1779–1784|jstor=29521701|doi=10.1136/bmj.291.6511.1779}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Newton was three, his mother remarried and went to live with her new husband, the Reverend Barnabas Smith, leaving her son in the care of his maternal grandmother, Margery Ayscough. Newton disliked his stepfather and maintained some enmity towards his mother for marrying him, as revealed by this entry in a list of sins committed up to the age of 19: "Threatening my father and mother Smith to burn them and the house over them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Keynes|first1=Milo|title=Balancing Newton's Mind: His Singular Behaviour and His Madness of 1692–93|journal=Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London|date=20 September 2008|volume=62|issue=3|pages=289–300|jstor=20462679|doi=10.1098/rsnr.2007.0025|pmid=19244857}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newton's mother had three children from her second marriage.{{sfn|Westfall|1980|p=55}}

From the age of about twelve until he was seventeen, Newton was educated at [[The King's School, Grantham]], which taught Latin and Greek and probably imparted a significant foundation of mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;"Newton the Mathematician" Z. Bechler, ed., Contemporary Newtonian Research(Dordrecht 1982) pp 110&amp;nbsp;– 111&lt;/ref&gt; He was removed from school, and returned to Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth by October 1659. His mother, widowed for the second time, attempted to make him a farmer, an occupation he hated.{{sfn|Westfall|1994|pp=16–19}} Henry Stokes, master at The King's School, persuaded his mother to send him back to school. Motivated partly by a desire for revenge against a schoolyard bully, he became the top-ranked student,{{sfn|White|1997|p=22}} distinguishing himself mainly by building [[sundial]]s and models of windmills.{{sfn|Westfall|1980|pp=60–62}}

In June 1661, he was admitted to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], on the recommendation of his uncle Rev William Ayscough, who had studied there. He started as a [[subsizar]]—paying his way by performing [[valet]]'s duties—until he was awarded a scholarship in 1664, guaranteeing him four more years until he could get his [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|MA]].{{sfn|Westfall|1980|pp=71,103}} At that time, the college's teachings were based on those of [[Aristotle]], whom Newton supplemented with modern philosophers such as [[René Descartes|Descartes]], and [[astronomers]] such as [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] and [[Thomas Street]], through whom he learned of [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]]'s work. He set down in his notebook a series of "[[Quaestiones quaedam philosophicae|''Quaestiones'']]" about [[mechanical philosophy]] as he found it. In 1665, he discovered the generalised [[binomial theorem]] and began to develop a mathematical theory that later became [[calculus]]. Soon after Newton had obtained his BA degree in August 1665, the university temporarily closed as a precaution against the [[Great Plague of London|Great Plague]]. Although he had been undistinguished as a Cambridge student,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-first=Michael|editor-last=Hoskins|date=1997|title=Cambridge Illustrated History of Astronomy|page=159|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0521411585}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newton's private studies at his home in Woolsthorpe over the subsequent two years saw the development of his theories on [[calculus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Newton|first=Isaac|title=Waste Book|url=http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-ADD-04004|publisher=Cambridge University Digital Library|accessdate=10 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[optics]], and the [[law of gravitation]].

In April 1667, he returned to Cambridge and in October was elected as a fellow of Trinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=RY644J|name=Newton, Isaac}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Westfall|1980|p=178}} Fellows were required to become ordained priests, although this was not enforced in the restoration years and an assertion of conformity to the Church of England was sufficient. However, by 1675 the issue could not be avoided and by then his unconventional views stood in the way.{{sfn|Westfall|1980|pp=330–1}} Nevertheless, Newton managed to avoid it by means of a special permission from [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] (see "Middle years" section below).

His studies had impressed the [[Lucasian Professor of Mathematics|Lucasian professor]] [[Isaac Barrow]], who was more anxious to develop his own religious and administrative potential (he became master of Trinity two years later); in 1669 Newton succeeded him, only one year after receiving his MA. He was elected a [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1672|Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1672]].&lt;ref name=frs/&gt;

===Middle years===

====Mathematics====
[[File:Bolton-newton.jpg|thumb|Isaac Newton (''Bolton, Sarah K. Famous Men of Science. NY: Thomas Y. Crowell &amp; Co., 1889'')]]

Newton's work has been said "to distinctly advance every branch of mathematics then studied".{{sfn|Ball|1908|p=319}} His work on the subject usually referred to as fluxions or calculus, seen in a manuscript of October 1666, is now published among Newton's mathematical papers.&lt;ref&gt;D T Whiteside (ed.), ''The Mathematical Papers of Isaac Newton'' (Volume 1), (Cambridge University Press, 1967), part 7 "The October 1666 Tract on Fluxions", [https://books.google.com/books?id=1ZcYsNBptfYC&amp;pg=PA400 at page 400, in 2008 reprint].&lt;/ref&gt; The author of the manuscript ''[[De analysi per aequationes numero terminorum infinitas]]'', sent by [[Isaac Barrow]] to [[John Collins (mathematician)|John Collins]] in June 1669, was identified by Barrow in a letter sent to Collins in August of that year as: "Mr Newton, a fellow of our College, and very young&amp;nbsp;... but of an extraordinary genius and proficiency in these things."{{sfn|Gjertsen|1986|page=149}}

Newton later became involved in a dispute with [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] over priority in the development of calculus (the [[Leibniz–Newton calculus controversy]]). Most modern historians believe that Newton and Leibniz developed calculus independently, although with very different [[mathematical notation|notations]]. Occasionally it has been suggested that Newton published almost nothing about it until 1693, and did not give a full account until 1704, while Leibniz began publishing a full account of his methods in 1684. (Leibniz's notation and "differential Method", nowadays recognised as much more convenient notations, were adopted by continental European mathematicians, and after 1820 or so, also by British mathematicians.) But such a suggestion fails to account for the calculus in [[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica#Book 1, De motu corporum|Book 1]] of Newton's ''Principia'' itself (published 1687) and in its forerunner manuscripts, such as ''[[De motu corporum in gyrum]]'' ("On the motion of bodies in orbit") of 1684; this content has been pointed out by critics of both Newton's time and modern times. The ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'' is not written in the language of calculus either as we know it or as [[Notation for differentiation#Newton's notation|Newton's (later) 'dot' notation]] would write it. His work extensively uses calculus in geometric form based on limiting values of the ratios of vanishingly small quantities: in the ''Principia'' itself, Newton gave demonstration of this under the name of "the method of first and last ratios"&lt;ref&gt;Newton, 'Principia', 1729 English translation, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Tm0FAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA41 at page 41].&lt;/ref&gt; and explained why he put his expositions in this form,&lt;ref&gt;Newton, 'Principia', 1729 English translation, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Tm0FAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA54 at page 54].&lt;/ref&gt; remarking also that "hereby the same thing is performed as by the method of indivisibles".{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Because of this, the ''Principia'' has been called "a book dense with the theory and application of the infinitesimal calculus" in modern times&lt;ref&gt;Clifford Truesdell, ''Essays in the History of Mechanics'' (Berlin, 1968), at p.99.&lt;/ref&gt; and "lequel est presque tout de ce calcul" ('nearly all of it is of this calculus') in Newton's time.&lt;ref&gt;In the preface to the Marquis de L'Hospital's ''Analyse des Infiniment Petits'' (Paris, 1696).&lt;/ref&gt; His use of methods involving "one or more orders of the infinitesimally small" is present in his ''De motu corporum in gyrum'' of 1684&lt;ref&gt;Starting with [[De motu corporum in gyrum#Contents|De motu corporum in gyrum]], see also [https://books.google.com/books?id=uvMGAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA2 (Latin) Theorem 1].&lt;/ref&gt; and in his papers on motion "during the two decades preceding 1684".&lt;ref&gt;D T Whiteside (1970), "The Mathematical principles underlying Newton's Principia Mathematica" in ''Journal for the History of Astronomy'', vol.1, pages 116–138, especially at pages 119–120.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sir Isaac Newton by Sir Godfrey Kneller, Bt.jpg|thumb|left|Newton in a 1702 portrait by [[Godfrey Kneller]]]]

Newton had been reluctant to publish his calculus because he feared controversy and criticism.{{sfn|Stewart|2009|p=107}} He was close to the Swiss mathematician [[Nicolas Fatio de Duillier]]. In 1691, Duillier started to write a new version of Newton's ''Principia'', and corresponded with Leibniz.{{sfn|Westfall|1980|pp=538–539}} In 1693, the relationship between Duillier and Newton deteriorated and the book was never completed.

Starting in 1699, other members of the [[Royal Society]] accused Leibniz of [[plagiarism]]. The dispute then broke out in full force in 1711 when the Royal Society proclaimed in a study that it was Newton who was the true discoverer and labelled Leibniz a fraud; it was later found that Newton wrote the study's concluding remarks on Leibniz. Thus began the bitter controversy which marred the lives of both Newton and Leibniz until the latter's death in 1716.{{sfn|Ball|1908|pp=356ff}}

Newton is generally credited with the [[Binomial theorem#Newton's generalised binomial theorem|generalised binomial theorem]], valid for any exponent. He discovered [[Newton's identities]], [[Newton's method]], classified [[cubic plane curve]]s ([[polynomials]] of degree three in two [[variable (mathematics)|variables]]), made substantial contributions to the theory of [[finite differences]], and was the first to use fractional indices and to employ [[coordinate geometry]] to derive solutions to [[Diophantine equations]]. He approximated [[series (mathematics)|partial]] sums of the [[harmonic series (mathematics)|harmonic series]] by [[logarithms]] (a precursor to [[Euler's summation formula]]) and was the first to use [[power series]] with confidence and to revert power series. Newton's work on infinite series was inspired by [[Simon Stevin]]'s decimals.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Błaszczyk | first1 = Piotr |last2 = Katz | first2 = Mikhail |author2-link = Mikhail Katz | last3 = Sherry | first3 = David | arxiv = 1202.4153 |doi = 10.1007/s10699-012-9285-8 | issue = |journal = [[Foundations of Science]] | pages = 43–74| title = Ten misconceptions from the history of analysis and their debunking | volume = 18|date = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Newton received his MA and became a Fellow of the "College of the Holy and Undivided Trinity" in 1667, he made the commitment that "I will either set Theology as the object of my studies and will take holy orders when the time prescribed by these statutes [7 years] arrives, or I will resign from the college."{{sfn|Westfall|1980|p=179}} Up until this point he had not thought much about religion and had twice signed his agreement to the [[thirty-nine articles]], the basis of [[Church of England]] doctrine.

He was appointed [[Lucasian Professor of Mathematics]] in 1669 on Barrow's recommendation. During that time, any Fellow of a college at Cambridge or Oxford was required to take [[holy orders]] and become an ordained [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] priest. However, the terms of the Lucasian professorship required that the holder ''not'' be active in the church (presumably so as to have more time for science). Newton argued that this should exempt him from the ordination requirement, and [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], whose permission was needed, accepted this argument. Thus a conflict between Newton's religious views and Anglican orthodoxy was averted.{{sfn|White|1997|p=151}}

====Optics====

In 1666, Newton observed that the spectrum of colours exiting a [[Triangular prism (optics)|prism]] in the position of [[minimum deviation]] is oblong, even when the light ray entering the prism is circular, which is to say, the prism refracts different colours by different angles.&lt;ref name="Whittaker" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Olivier Darrigol|title=A History of Optics from Greek Antiquity to the Nineteenth Century|url={{Google books|Ye_1AAAAQBAJ|page=PA81|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}}|date=26 January 2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-964437-7|pages=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led him to conclude that colour is a property intrinsic to light—a point which had been debated in prior years.

From 1670 to 1672, Newton lectured on optics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Newton |first=Isaac |title=Hydrostatics, Optics, Sound and Heat|url=http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-ADD-03970/|publisher=Cambridge University Digital Library|accessdate=10 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period he investigated the [[refraction]] of light, demonstrating that the multicoloured spectrum produced by a prism could be recomposed into white light by a [[lens (optics)|lens]] and a second prism.{{sfn|Ball|1908|p=324}} Modern scholarship has revealed that Newton's analysis and resynthesis of white light owes a debt to [[Corpuscularianism|corpuscular]] alchemy.&lt;ref&gt;[[William R. Newman]],  "Newton's Early Optical Theory and its Debt to Chymistry," in Danielle Jacquart and Michel Hochmann, eds., ''Lumière et vision dans les sciences et dans les arts'' (Geneva: Droz, 2010), pp. 283–307.  A free access online version of this article can be found at [http://webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu/newton/html/Newton_optics-alchemy_Jacquart_paper.pdf the ''Chymistry of Isaac Newton'' project]&lt;/ref&gt;

He showed that coloured light does not change its properties by separating out a coloured beam and shining it on various objects, and that regardless of whether reflected, scattered, or transmitted, the light remains the same colour. Thus, he observed that colour is the result of objects interacting with already-coloured light rather than objects generating the colour themselves. This is known as [[Early life of Isaac Newton#Newton's theory of colour|Newton's theory of colour]].{{sfn|Ball|1908|p=325}}

[[File:Dispersive Prism Illustration.jpg|thumb|left|Illustration of a [[dispersive prism]] separating white light into the colours of the spectrum, as discovered by Newton]]

From this work, he concluded that the lens of any [[refracting telescope]] would suffer from the [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]] of light into colours ([[chromatic aberration]]). As a proof of the concept, he constructed a telescope using reflective mirrors instead of lenses as the [[objective (optics)|objective]] to bypass that problem.&lt;ref name="The Early Period (1608–1672)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="White 1997, p170"/&gt; Building the design, the first known functional reflecting telescope, today known as a [[Newtonian telescope]],&lt;ref name="White 1997, p170"/&gt; involved solving the problem of a suitable mirror material and shaping technique. Newton ground his own mirrors out of a custom composition of highly reflective [[speculum metal]], using [[Newton's rings]] to judge the [[quality (philosophy)|quality]] of the optics for his telescopes. In late 1668,&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt; he was able to produce this first reflecting telescope. It was about eight inches long and it gave a clearer and larger image. In 1671, the Royal Society asked for a demonstration of his reflecting telescope.{{sfn|White|1997|p=168}} Their interest encouraged him to publish his notes, ''Of Colours'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Newton|first1=Isaac|title=Of Colours|url=http://www.newtonproject.sussex.ac.uk/view/texts/normalized/NATP00004|website=The Newton Project|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which he later expanded into the work ''[[Opticks]]''. When [[Robert Hooke]] criticised some of Newton's ideas, Newton was so offended that he withdrew from public debate. Newton and Hooke had brief exchanges in 1679–80, when Hooke, appointed to manage the Royal Society's correspondence, opened up a correspondence intended to elicit contributions from Newton to Royal Society transactions,&lt;ref name="hooke1679nov24"/&gt; which had the effect of stimulating Newton to work out a proof that the elliptical form of planetary orbits would result from a centripetal force inversely proportional to the square of the radius vector (see [[Newton's law of universal gravitation#History|Newton's law of universal gravitation&amp;nbsp;– History]] and ''[[De motu corporum in gyrum]]''). But the two men remained generally on poor terms until Hooke's death.&lt;ref&gt;Iliffe, Robert (2007) Newton. A very short introduction, Oxford University Press 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Newton-letter-to-briggs 03.jpg|thumb|upright|Facsimile of a 1682 letter from Isaac Newton to Dr William Briggs, commenting on Briggs' "A New Theory of Vision"]]

Newton argued that light is composed of particles or corpuscles, which were refracted by accelerating into a denser medium. He verged on soundlike waves to explain the repeated pattern of reflection and transmission by thin films (Opticks Bk.II, Props. 12), but still retained his theory of 'fits' that disposed corpuscles to be reflected or transmitted (Props.13). However, later physicists favoured a purely wavelike explanation of light to account for the [[interference (wave propagation)|interference]] patterns and the general phenomenon of [[diffraction]]. Today's [[quantum mechanics]], [[photons]], and the idea of [[wave–particle duality]] bear only a minor resemblance to Newton's understanding of light.

In his ''Hypothesis of Light'' of 1675, Newton [[wikt:posit|posited]] the existence of the [[luminiferous aether|ether]] to transmit forces between particles. The contact with the [[Cambridge Platonists|Cambridge Platonist]] philosopher [[Henry More]] revived his interest in alchemy.&lt;ref name="More"/&gt; He replaced the ether with occult forces based on [[Hermeticism|Hermetic]] ideas of attraction and repulsion between particles. [[John Maynard Keynes]], who acquired many of Newton's writings on alchemy, stated that "Newton was not the first of the age of reason: He was the last of the magicians."&lt;ref name="The Collected Writings of John Maynard Keynes Volume X"/&gt; Newton's interest in alchemy cannot be isolated from his contributions to science.&lt;ref name="More"/&gt; This was at a time when there was no clear distinction between alchemy and science. Had he not relied on the [[occult]] idea of [[action at a distance (physics)|action at a distance]], across a vacuum, he might not have developed his theory of gravity. (See also [[Isaac Newton's occult studies]].)

In 1704, Newton published ''[[Opticks]]'', in which he expounded his corpuscular theory of light. He considered light to be made up of extremely subtle corpuscles, that ordinary matter was made of grosser corpuscles and speculated that through a kind of alchemical transmutation "Are not gross Bodies and Light convertible into one another,&amp;nbsp;... and may not Bodies receive much of their Activity from the Particles of Light which enter their Composition?"&lt;ref name="Newton's Alchemy and His Theory of Matter"/&gt; Newton also constructed a primitive form of a frictional [[electrostatic generator]], using a glass globe.&lt;ref&gt;Opticks, 2nd Ed 1706. Query 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article entitled "Newton, prisms, and the 'opticks' of tunable lasers"&lt;ref name="OPN1"/&gt; it is indicated that Newton in his book ''[[Opticks]]'' was the first to show a diagram using a prism as a beam expander. In the same book he describes, via diagrams, the use of multiple-prism arrays. Some 278 years after Newton's discussion, [[beam expander#Multiple-prism beam expanders|multiple-prism beam expanders]] became central to the development of [[laser linewidth|narrow-linewidth]] [[tunable laser]]s. Also, the use of these prismatic beam expanders led to the [[multiple-prism dispersion theory]].&lt;ref name=OPN1/&gt;

Subsequent to Newton, much has been amended. [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Young]] and [[Augustin-Jean Fresnel|Fresnel]] combined Newton's particle theory with [[Christiaan Huygens|Huygens']] wave theory to show that colour is the visible manifestation of light's wavelength. Science also slowly came to realise the difference between perception of colour and mathematisable optics. The German poet and scientist, [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], could not shake the Newtonian foundation but "one hole Goethe did find in Newton's armour,&amp;nbsp;... Newton had committed himself to the doctrine that refraction without colour was impossible. He therefore thought that the object-glasses of telescopes must for ever remain imperfect, achromatism and refraction being incompatible. This inference was proved by [[John Dollond|
Dollond]] to be wrong."&lt;ref&gt;Tyndall, John. (1880). ''Popular Science Monthly'' Volume 17, July. [[s:Popular Science Monthly/Volume 17/July 1880/Goethe's Farbenlehre: Theory of Colors II]]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mechanics and gravitation====
{{further|Writing of Principia Mathematica}}
[[File:NewtonsPrincipia.jpg|thumb|Newton's own copy of his ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'', with hand-written corrections for the second edition]]

In 1679, Newton returned to his work on [[celestial mechanics]] by considering gravitation and its effect on the orbits of [[planet]]s with reference to [[Kepler's laws]] of planetary motion. This followed stimulation by a brief exchange of letters in 1679–80 with Hooke, who had been appointed to manage the Royal Society's correspondence, and who opened a correspondence intended to elicit contributions from Newton to Royal Society transactions.&lt;ref name=hooke1679nov24 /&gt; Newton's reawakening interest in astronomical matters received further stimulus by the appearance of a comet in the winter of 1680–1681, on which he corresponded with [[John Flamsteed]].{{sfn|Westfall|1980|pp=391–2}} After the exchanges with Hooke, Newton worked out proof that the elliptical form of planetary orbits would result from a centripetal force inversely proportional to the square of the radius vector (see [[Newton's law of universal gravitation#History|Newton's law of universal gravitation&amp;nbsp;– History]] and ''De motu corporum in gyrum''). Newton communicated his results to [[Edmond Halley]] and to the Royal Society in ''[[De motu corporum in gyrum]]'', a tract written on about nine sheets which was copied into the Royal Society's Register Book in December 1684.&lt;ref&gt;D T Whiteside (ed.), 'Mathematical Papers of Isaac Newton', vol.6, 1684–1691, Cambridge University Press 1974, at page 30.&lt;/ref&gt; This tract contained the nucleus that Newton developed and expanded to form the ''Principia''.

The ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'' was published on 5 July 1687 with encouragement and financial help from [[Edmond Halley]]. In this work, Newton stated the three universal laws of motion. Together, these laws describe the relationship between any object, the forces acting upon it and the resulting motion, laying the foundation for [[classical mechanics]]. They contributed to many advances during the [[Industrial Revolution]] which soon followed and were not improved upon for more than 200 years. Many of these advancements continue to be the underpinnings of non-relativistic technologies in the modern world. He used the Latin word ''gravitas'' (weight) for the effect that would become known as [[gravity]], and defined the law of [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|universal gravitation]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

In the same work, Newton presented a calculus-like method of geometrical analysis using 'first and last ratios', gave the first analytical determination (based on [[Boyle's law]]) of the speed of sound in air, inferred the oblateness of Earth's spheroidal figure, accounted for the precession of the equinoxes as a result of the Moon's gravitational attraction on the Earth's oblateness, initiated the gravitational study of the [[Lunar theory#Newton|irregularities in the motion of the moon]], provided a theory for the determination of the orbits of comets, and much more.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Newton made clear his [[heliocentric]] view of the Solar System—developed in a somewhat modern way, because already in the mid-1680s he recognised the "deviation of the Sun" from the centre of gravity of the Solar System.&lt;ref&gt;See Curtis Wilson, "The Newtonian achievement in astronomy", pages 233–274 in R Taton &amp; C Wilson (eds) (1989) ''The General History of Astronomy'', Volume, 2A', [https://books.google.com/books?id=rkQKU-wfPYMC&amp;pg=PA233 at page 233].&lt;/ref&gt; For Newton, it was not precisely the centre of the Sun or any other body that could be considered at rest, but rather "the common centre of gravity of the Earth, the Sun and all the Planets is to be esteem'd the Centre of the World", and this centre of gravity "either is at rest or moves uniformly forward in a right line" (Newton adopted the "at rest" alternative in view of common consent that the centre, wherever it was, was at rest).&lt;ref&gt;Text quotations are from 1729 translation of Newton's ''Principia'', Book 3 (1729 vol.2) [https://books.google.com/books?id=6EqxPav3vIsC&amp;pg=PA233 at pages 232–233].&lt;/ref&gt;

Newton's postulate of an invisible [[action at a distance (physics)|force able to act over vast distances]] led to him being criticised for introducing "[[occult]] agencies" into science.&lt;ref&gt;Edelglass et al., ''Matter and Mind'', {{isbn|0-940262-45-2}}. p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in the second edition of the ''Principia'' (1713), Newton firmly rejected such criticisms in a concluding [[General Scholium]], writing that it was enough that the phenomena implied a gravitational attraction, as they did; but they did not so far indicate its cause, and it was both unnecessary and improper to frame hypotheses of things that were not implied by the phenomena. (Here Newton used what became his famous expression ''"hypotheses non-fingo"''&lt;ref&gt;On the meaning and origins of this expression, see Kirsten Walsh, [https://blogs.otago.ac.nz/emxphi/2010/10/does-newton-feign-an-hypothesis/ Does Newton feign an hypothesis?], [https://blogs.otago.ac.nz/emxphi/ Early Modern Experimental Philosophy], 18 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;).

With the ''Principia'', Newton became internationally recognised.{{sfn|Westfall|1980|loc=Chapter 11}} He acquired a circle of admirers, including the Swiss-born mathematician [[#Duillier|Nicolas Fatio de Duillier]].&lt;ref name="Hatch"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.clas.ufl.edu/users/ufhatch/pages/13-NDFE/newton/05-newton-timeline-m.htm |title=Newton Timeline |author=Professor Robert A. Hatch, University of Florida |accessdate=13 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Classification of cubics====
{{Main|Cubic plane curve}}

Newton found 72 of the 78 "species" of cubic curves and categorized them into four types.{{When|date=August 2018}} In 1717, and probably with Newton's help, [[James Stirling (mathematician)|James Stirling]] proved that every cubic was one of these four types. Newton also claimed that the four types could be obtained by [[Projective plane|plane projection]] from one of them, and this was proved in 1731, four years after his death.&lt;ref&gt;''Conics and Cubics,'' Robert Bix, Springer [[Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics]], 2nd edition, 2006, Springer Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later life===
{{Main|Later life of Isaac Newton}}

In the 1690s, Newton wrote a number of [[religious tracts]] dealing with the literal and symbolic interpretation of the Bible. A manuscript Newton sent to [[John Locke]] in which he disputed the fidelity of [[1 John 5:7]] and its fidelity to the original manuscripts of the New Testament, remained unpublished until 1785.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libraries.psu.edu/tas/locke/mss/c1690.html|title=John Locke Manuscripts&amp;nbsp;– Chronological Listing: 1690|website=psu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John C. Attig, [http://www.libraries.psu.edu/tas/locke/bib/ch5c.html#01160 John Locke Bibliography&amp;nbsp;— Chapter 5, Religion, 1751–1900]&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars long debated whether Newton disputed the doctrine of the [[Trinity]]. His first biographer, [[Sir David Brewster]], who compiled his manuscripts for over 20 years, interpreted Newton to be questioning the veracity of passages referring to this, but never denying the doctrine of the Trinity as such.&lt;ref&gt;Brewster states that Newton was never known as an [[Arianism|Arian]] during his lifetime, it was [[William Whiston]] (an Arian) who first argued that "Sir Isaac Newton was so hearty for the Baptists, as well as for the Eusebians or Arians, that he sometimes suspected these two were the two witnesses in the Revelations," while others like [[Hopton Haynes]] (a Mint employee and Humanitarian), "mentioned to [[Richard Baron (dissenting minister)|Richard Baron]], that Newton held the same doctrine as himself". David Brewster. "Memoirs of the Life, Writings, and Discoveries of Sir Isaac Newton:" p.268.&lt;/ref&gt; In the twentieth century, encrypted manuscripts written by Newton and bought by [[John Maynard Keynes]] (among others) were deciphered&lt;ref name="The Collected Writings of John Maynard Keynes Volume X"/&gt; and it became known that Newton did indeed reject Trinitarianism.&lt;ref name="heretic"/&gt;

[[File:Newton 25.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Isaac Newton in old age in 1712, portrait by [[Sir James Thornhill]]]]

Later works—''[[The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended]]'' (1728) and ''Observations Upon the Prophecies of Daniel and the Apocalypse of St. John'' (1733)—were published after his death. He also devoted a great deal of time to [[alchemy]] (see above).&lt;!--old cite was (Westfall 1980, pp. 530–1) "notes that Newton apparently abandoned his alchemical researches"--&gt;

Newton was also a member of the [[Parliament of England]] for [[Cambridge University (UK Parliament constituency)|Cambridge University]] in 1689–90 and 1701–2, but according to some accounts his only comments were to complain about a cold draught in the chamber and request that the window be closed.{{sfn|White|1997|p=232}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=E.R. |last1=Edwards |first2=Geoffrey |last2=Jaggar |chapter=Newton, Isaac (1642–1727) |title=The History of Parliament: the House of Commons 1660–1690 |editor-first=B.D. |editor-last=Henning |date=1983 |url=http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1660-1690/member/newton-isaac-1642-1727 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=D.W. |last=Hayton |chapter=Newton, Isaac (1642–1727) |title=The History of Parliament: the House of Commons 1690–1715 |editor1-first=D. |editor1-last=Hayton |editor2-first=E. |editor2-last=Cruickshanks |editor3-first=S. |editor3-last=Handley |date=2002 |url=http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1690-1715/member/newton-isaac-1642-1727 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was however noted by Cambridge diarist [[Abraham de la Pryme]] as having rebuked students who were frightening local residents by claiming that a house was haunted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/06/what-students-should-avoid-during-freshers-week-100-years-ago-an/|title=What students should avoid during fresher's week (100years ago and now)|author=Patrick Sawer|work=Daily Telegraph|date=6 September 2016|accessdate=7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newton moved to London to take up the post of warden of the [[Royal Mint]] in 1696, a position that he had obtained through the patronage of [[Charles Montagu, 1st Earl of Halifax]], then [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]]. He took charge of England's great recoining, somewhat treading on the toes of Lord Lucas, Governor of the Tower (and securing the job of deputy [[comptroller]] of the temporary Chester branch for Edmond Halley). Newton became perhaps the best-known [[Master of the Mint]] upon the death of [[Thomas Neale]] in 1699, a position Newton held for the last 30 years of his life.&lt;ref name="Mint"&gt;{{cite episode |series=Science Friday |title=Isaac Newton: Physicist And&amp;nbsp;...

As Warden, and afterwards Master, of the Royal Mint, Newton estimated that 20 percent of the coins taken in during the [[Great Recoinage of 1696]] were [[counterfeit]]. Counterfeiting was [[High treason in the United Kingdom|high treason]], punishable by the felon being [[hanged, drawn and quartered]]. Despite this, convicting even the most flagrant criminals could be extremely difficult. However, Newton proved equal to the task.{{sfn|White|1997|p=259}}

Disguised as a habitué of bars and taverns, he gathered much of that evidence himself.{{sfn|White|1997|p=267}} For all the barriers placed to prosecution, and separating the branches of government, [[English law]] still had ancient and formidable customs of authority. Newton had himself made a [[justice of the peace]] in all the home counties—there is a draft of a letter regarding this matter stuck into Newton's personal first edition of his ''Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica'' which he must have been amending at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Newton|first=Isaac|title=Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|url=http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/PR-ADV-B-00039-00001/|publisher=Cambridge University Digital Library|accessdate=10 January 2012|pages=265–266}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then he conducted more than 100 cross-examinations of witnesses, informers, and suspects between June 1698 and Christmas 1699. Newton successfully prosecuted 28 coiners.{{sfn|Westfall|2007|p=73}}

As a result of a report written by Newton on 21 September 1717 to the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury the bimetallic relationship between gold coins and silver coins was changed by Royal proclamation on 22 December 1717, forbidding the exchange of gold guineas for more than 21 silver shillings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pierre-marteau.com/editions/1701-25-mint-reports/report-1717-09-25.html On the Value of Gold and Silver in European Currencies and the Consequences on the World-wide Gold- and Silver-Trade], Sir Isaac Newton, 21 September 1717.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;By The King, A Proclamation Declaring the Rates at which Gold shall be current in Payments [https://archive.org/details/numismaticser1v05royauoft reproduced in the numismatic chronicle and journal of the Royal Numismatic Society, Vol V., April 1842&amp;nbsp;– January 1843]&lt;/ref&gt; This inadvertently resulted in a silver shortage as silver coins were used to pay for imports, while exports were paid for in gold, effectively moving Britain from the [[silver standard]] to its first [[gold standard]].

Newton was made President of the [[Royal Society]] in 1703 and an associate of the French [[French Academy of Sciences|Académie des Sciences]]. In his position at the Royal Society, Newton made an enemy of [[John Flamsteed]], the [[Astronomer Royal]], by prematurely publishing Flamsteed's ''Historia Coelestis Britannica'', which Newton had used in his studies.{{sfn|White|1997|p=317}}

In April 1705, Queen Anne [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] Newton during a royal visit to Trinity College, Cambridge. The knighthood is likely to have been motivated by political considerations connected with the [[Parliamentary elections|Parliamentary election]] in May 1705, rather than any recognition of Newton's scientific work or services as Master of the Mint.&lt;ref&gt;"The Queen's 'great Assistance' to Newton's election was his knighting, an honor bestowed not for his contributions to science, nor for his service at the Mint, but for the greater glory of party politics in the election of 1705." {{harvnb|Westfall|1994|p=245}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newton was the second scientist to be knighted, after Sir [[Francis Bacon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=This Day in History: Isaac Newton is Knighted|url=http://www.historychannel.com.au/classroom/day-in-history/553/isaac-newton-is-knighted|website=History Channel|publisher=A&amp;E Television Networks|accessdate=18 August 2014|date=2016-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barnham|first1=Kay|title=Isaac Newton|date=2014|publisher=Raintree|location=2014|isbn=978-1-4109-6235-5|page=26|url={{Google books|2f5LAgAAQBAJ|page=|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}}|accessdate=18 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newton was one of many people who lost heavily when the [[South Sea Company]] collapsed.  Their most significant trade was slaves, and according to his niece, he lost around £20,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Holodny|first1=Elena|title=Isaac Newton was a genius, but even he lost millions in the stock market|url=http://www.businessinsider.com.au/isaac-newton-lost-a-fortune-on-englands-hottest-stock-2016-1|publisher=Business Insider|accessdate=6 April 2016|date=2016-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the end of his life, Newton took up residence at [[Cranbury Park]], near [[Winchester]] with his niece and her husband, until his death in 1727.&lt;ref name = "Yonge6"&gt;{{cite web|last=[[Charlotte M.

===Death===
Newton died in his sleep in London on 20 March 1727 ([[Old Style and New Style dates|OS]] 20 March 1726; [[Old Style and New Style dates|NS]] 31 March 1727).&lt;ref name="OSNS"/&gt; His body was buried in [[Westminster Abbey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=6569 |date=1 April 1727  |page=7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Voltaire]] may have been present at his funeral.&lt;ref&gt;Dobre and Nyden suggest that there is no clear evidence that Voltaire was present; see page 89 of {{cite book|title=Cartesian Empiricism|author=Mihnea Dobre, Tammy Nyden|publisher=Springer|year=2013|isbn=978-94-007-7690-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; A bachelor, he had divested much of his estate to relatives during his last years, and died [[intestacy|intestate]].&lt;ref name="Newton, Isaac (1642–1727)"/&gt; His papers went to John Conduitt and Catherine Barton.&lt;ref name="Mann"/&gt; After his death, Newton's hair was examined and found to contain [[mercury (element)|mercury]], probably resulting from his alchemical pursuits. [[Mercury poisoning]] could explain Newton's eccentricity in late life.&lt;ref name="Newton, Isaac (1642–1727)"/&gt;

===Personal relations===
Although it was claimed that he was once engaged,&lt;ref&gt;This claim was made by [[William Stukeley]] in 1727, in a letter about Newton written to [[Richard Mead]]. [[Charles Hutton]], who in the late eighteenth century collected oral traditions about earlier scientists, declared that there "do not appear to be any sufficient reason for his never marrying, if he had an inclination so to do. It is much more likely that he had a constitutional indifference to the state, and even to the sex in general." Charles Hutton, ''A Mathematical and Philosophical Dictionary'' (1795/6), vol. 2, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; Newton never married. The French writer and philosopher [[Voltaire]], who was in London at the time of Newton's funeral, said that he "was never sensible to any passion, was not subject to the common frailties of mankind, nor had any commerce with women—a circumstance which was assured me by the physician and surgeon who attended him in his last moments".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Letters on England|author=Voltaire|chapter= 14|date=1894|page=100|chapter-url=https://archive.org/stream/lettersonenglan00voltgoog#page/n102}}&lt;/ref&gt; The widespread belief that he died a [[Virginity|virgin]] has been commented on by writers such as mathematician [[Charles Hutton]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Philosophical and Mathematical Dictionary Containing&amp;nbsp;...

===Fame===
[[File:Isaac Newton grave in Westminster Abbey.jpg|thumb|upright|Newton's tomb monument in [[Westminster Abbey]]]]

The mathematician [[Joseph Louis Lagrange|Joseph-Louis Lagrange]] said that Newton was the greatest genius who ever lived, and once added that Newton was also "the most fortunate, for we cannot find more than once a system of the world to establish."&lt;ref&gt;Fred L. Wilson, ''History of Science: Newton'' citing: Delambre, M. "Notice sur la vie et les ouvrages de M. le comte J. L. Lagrange," ''Oeuvres de Lagrange'' I. Paris, 1867, p. xx.&lt;/ref&gt; English poet [[Alexander Pope]] wrote the famous [[epitaph]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Nature and nature's laws lay hid in night;&lt;br&gt;
God said "Let Newton be" and all was light.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Newton was relatively modest about his achievements, writing in a letter to [[Robert Hooke]] in February 1676:
&lt;blockquote&gt;If I have seen further it is by [[standing on the shoulders of giants]].&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Isaac Newton to Robert Hooke, 5 February 1676, as transcribed in Jean-Pierre Maury (1992) ''Newton: Understanding the Cosmos'', '[[New Horizons (Thames &amp; Hudson)|New Horizons]]' series.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Two writers think that the above quotation, written at a time when Newton and Hooke were in dispute over optical discoveries, was an oblique attack on Hooke (said to have been short and hunchbacked), rather than—or in addition to—a statement of modesty.&lt;ref&gt;John Gribbin (2002) ''Science: A History 1543–2001'', p 164.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|White|1997|p=187}}  On the other hand, the widely known proverb about [[standing on the shoulders of giants]], published among others by seventeenth-century poet [[George Herbert]] (a former orator of the University of Cambridge and fellow of Trinity College) in his ''Jacula Prudentum'' (1651), had as its main point that "a dwarf on a giant's shoulders sees farther of the two", and so its effect as an analogy would place Newton himself rather than Hooke as the 'dwarf'.

In a later memoir, Newton wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I do not know what I may appear to the world, but to myself I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the sea-shore, and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.&lt;ref&gt;Memoirs of the Life, Writings, and Discoveries of Sir Isaac Newton (1855) by Sir David Brewster (Volume II. Ch. 27)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1816, a tooth said to have belonged to Newton was sold for £730&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=16 January 1881|title=Silly relic-worship|newspaper=The New York Times|page=10|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E02E4DE1730EE3ABC4E52DFB766838A699FDE|accessdate=12 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{smallcaps|us}}$3,633) in London to an aristocrat who had it set in a ring.&lt;ref name=Guinness&gt;{{cite book|title=Guinness World Records 2002|url=https://www.amazon.com/Guinness-World-Records-Antonia-Cunningham/dp/product-description/0553583786|accessdate=12 July 2009|isbn=9780553583786|date=April 2002|editor1=Cunningham, Antonia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Guinness World Records]] 2002'' classified it as the most valuable tooth, which would value approximately £25,000 ({{smallcaps|us}}$35,700) in late 2001.&lt;ref name=Guinness/&gt; Who bought it and who currently has it has not been disclosed.

[[Albert Einstein]] kept a picture of Newton on his study wall alongside ones of [[Michael Faraday]] and [[James Clerk Maxwell]].&lt;ref&gt;"Einstein's Heroes: Imagining the World through the Language of Mathematics", by Robyn Arianrhod UQP, reviewed by Jane Gleeson-White, 10 November 2003, ''The Sydney Morning Herald''&lt;/ref&gt; Newton remains influential to today's scientists, as demonstrated by a 2005 survey of members of Britain's [[Royal Society]] (formerly headed by Newton) asking who had the greater effect on the history of science, Newton or Einstein. Royal Society scientists deemed Newton to have made the greater overall contribution.&lt;ref name="royalsoc.ac.uk"/&gt; In 1999, an opinion poll of 100 of today's leading physicists voted Einstein the "greatest physicist ever;" with Newton the runner-up, while a parallel survey of rank-and-file physicists by the site PhysicsWeb gave the top spot to Newton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/541840.stm|title=Opinion poll.

===Commemorations===
[[File:Isaac Newton statue.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Newton statue on display at the [[Oxford University Museum of Natural History]]]]
Newton's monument (1731) can be seen in [[Westminster Abbey]], at the north of the entrance to the choir against the choir screen, near his tomb. It was executed by the sculptor [[Michael Rysbrack]] (1694–1770) in white and grey marble with design by the architect [[William Kent]]. The monument features a figure of Newton reclining on top of a sarcophagus, his right elbow resting on several of his great books and his left hand pointing to a scroll with a mathematical design. Above him is a pyramid and a celestial globe showing the signs of the Zodiac and the path of the comet of 1680. A relief panel depicts [[putti]] using instruments such as a telescope and prism.&lt;ref name="wmabbey"/&gt; The Latin inscription on the base translates as:&lt;blockquote&gt;Here is buried Isaac Newton, Knight, who by a strength of mind almost divine, and mathematical principles peculiarly his own, explored the course and figures of the planets, the paths of comets, the tides of the sea, the dissimilarities in rays of light, and, what no other scholar has previously imagined, the properties of the colours thus produced. Diligent, sagacious and faithful, in his expositions of nature, antiquity and the holy Scriptures, he vindicated by his philosophy the majesty of God mighty and good, and expressed the simplicity of the Gospel in his manners. Mortals rejoice that there has existed such and so great an ornament of the human race! He was born on 25 December 1642, and died on 20 March 1726/7.—Translation from G.L. Smyth, ''The Monuments and Genii of St. Paul's Cathedral, and of Westminster Abbey'' (1826), ii, 703–4.&lt;ref name="wmabbey"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From 1978 until 1988, an image of Newton designed by Harry Ecclestone appeared on Series D £1 [[banknotes of the pound sterling|banknotes]] issued by the [[Bank of England]] (the last £1 notes to be issued by the Bank of England). Newton was shown on the reverse of the notes holding a book and accompanied by a telescope, a prism and a map of the [[Solar System]].&lt;ref name="bankofengland"/&gt;

A statue of Isaac Newton, looking at an apple at his feet, can be seen at the [[Oxford University Museum of Natural History]]. A large bronze statue, ''[[Newton, after William Blake]]'', by [[Eduardo Paolozzi]], dated 1995 and inspired by [[William Blake|Blake]]'s [[Newton (Blake)|etching]], dominates the piazza of the [[British Library]] in London.

==Religious views==
{{Main|Religious views of Isaac Newton}}
Although born into an [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] family, by his thirties Newton held a Christian faith that, had it been made public, would not have been considered orthodox by mainstream Christianity;&lt;ref name="Newton - 1"&gt;[[Richard S. Westfall]]&amp;nbsp;– [[Indiana University]] {{cite book|url=http://galileo.rice.edu/Catalog/NewFiles/newton.html|title=The Galileo Project|publisher=([[Rice University]])|accessdate=5 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; in recent times he has been described as a [[heresy|heretic]].&lt;ref name="heretic"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Snobelen |first=Stephen D. |authorlink=Stephen Snobelen|title=Isaac Newton, heretic: the strategies of a Nicodemite|journal=British Journal for the History of Science|volume=32|pages=381–419|date=1999|url=http://isaacnewtonstheology.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/heretic.pdf|format=PDF|doi=10.1017/S0007087499003751|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1672 he had started to record his theological researches in notebooks which he showed to no one and which have only recently been examined. They demonstrate an extensive knowledge of early church writings and show that in the conflict between [[Athanasius]] and [[Arius]] which defined the [[Athanasian Creed|Creed]], he took the side of Arius, the loser, who rejected the conventional view of the [[Trinity]]. Newton "recognized Christ as a divine mediator between God and man, who was subordinate to the Father who created him."{{sfn|Westfall|1980|p=315}} He was especially interested in prophecy, but for him, "the [[Great Apostasy|great apostasy]] was trinitarianism."{{sfn|Westfall|1980|p=321}}

Newton tried unsuccessfully to obtain one of the two fellowships that exempted the holder from the ordination requirement. At the last moment in 1675 he received a dispensation from the government that excused him and all future holders of the Lucasian chair.{{sfn|Westfall|1980|pp=331–334}}

In Newton's eyes, worshipping Christ as God was [[idolatry]], to him the fundamental sin. {{sfn|Westfall|1994|p=124}} Historian [[Stephen Snobelen|Stephen D. Snobelen]] says, "Isaac Newton was a [[heresy|heretic]]. But&amp;nbsp;... he never made a public declaration of his private faith—which the orthodox would have deemed extremely radical. He hid his faith so well that scholars are still unravelling his personal beliefs."&lt;ref name="heretic"/&gt; Snobelen concludes that Newton was at least a [[Socinian]] sympathiser (he owned and had thoroughly read at least eight Socinian books), possibly an [[Arianism|Arian]] and almost certainly an [[anti-trinitarian]].&lt;ref name="heretic"/&gt;

In a minority view, T.C. Pfizenmaier argues that Newton held the [[Eastern Orthodox]] view on the Trinity.&lt;ref name="Was Isaac Newton an Arian?"/&gt; However, this type of view 'has lost support of late with the availability of Newton's theological papers',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Snobelen |first=Stephen D. |title=Isaac Newton, heretic: the strategies of a Nicodemite |journal=British Journal for the History of Science |volume=32 |issue=4 |pages=381–419 [383] |date=1999 |url=http://www.isaac-newton.org/heretic.pdf |format=PDF |doi=10.1017/S0007087499003751 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131007005450/http://isaac-newton.org/heretic.pdf |archivedate= 7 October 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and now most scholars identify Newton as an [[Nontrinitarianism|Antitrinitarian]] [[monotheist]].&lt;ref name="heretic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dulles"/&gt;

Although the laws of motion and universal gravitation became Newton's best-known discoveries, he warned against using them to view the Universe as a mere machine, as if akin to a great clock. He said, "Gravity explains the motions of the planets, but it cannot explain who set the planets in motion. God governs all things and knows all that is or can be done."&lt;ref name="tiner"/&gt;

Along with his scientific fame, Newton's studies of the Bible and of the early [[Church Fathers]] were also noteworthy. Newton wrote works on [[textual criticism]], most notably ''[[An Historical Account of Two Notable Corruptions of Scripture]]'' and ''Observations upon the Prophecies of Daniel, and the Apocalypse of St. John''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16878 'Observations upon the Prophecies of Daniel, and the Apocalypse of St. John''] 1733&lt;/ref&gt; He placed the crucifixion of [[Jesus Christ]] at 3 April, AD 33, which agrees with one traditionally accepted date.&lt;ref&gt;John P. Meier, ''[[John P. Meier#A Marginal Jew: Rethinking the Historical Jesus|A Marginal Jew]]'', v. 1, pp. 382–402 after narrowing the years to 30 or 33, provisionally judges 30 most likely.&lt;/ref&gt;

He believed in a rationally [[immanent]] world, but he rejected the [[hylozoism]] implicit in [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] and [[Baruch Spinoza]]. The ordered and dynamically informed Universe could be understood, and must be understood, by an active reason. In his correspondence, Newton claimed that in writing the ''Principia'' "I had an eye upon such Principles as might work with considering men for the belief of a Deity".&lt;ref&gt;Newton to [[Richard Bentley]] 10 December 1692, in Turnbull et al. (1959–77), vol 3, p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt; He saw evidence of design in the system of the world: "Such a wonderful uniformity in the planetary system must be allowed the effect of choice". But Newton insisted that divine intervention would eventually be required to reform the system, due to the slow growth of instabilities.&lt;ref&gt;Opticks, 2nd Ed 1706. Query 31.&lt;/ref&gt; For this, Leibniz lampooned him: "God Almighty wants to wind up his watch from time to time: otherwise it would cease to move. He had not, it seems, sufficient foresight to make it a perpetual motion."&lt;ref&gt;H. G. Alexander (ed) ''The Leibniz-Clarke correspondence'', [[Manchester University Press]], 1998, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Newton's position was vigorously defended by his follower [[Samuel Clarke]] in a [[Leibniz-Clarke correspondence|famous correspondence]]. A century later, [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]]'s work "[[Traité de mécanique céleste|Celestial Mechanics]]" had a natural explanation for why the planet orbits do not require periodic divine intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Neil Degrasse|last=Tyson|journal=Natural History Magazine|date=1 November 2005|title=The Perimeter of Ignorance|url=http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/tyson/read/2005/11/01/the-perimeter-of-ignorance|accessdate=7 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effect on religious thought===
[[File:Newton-WilliamBlake.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Newton (Blake)|Newton]]'', by [[William Blake]]; here, Newton is depicted critically as a "divine geometer". This copy of the work is currently held by the [[Tate Collection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blakearchive.org/exist/blake/archive/copyinfo.xq?copyid=but306.1|title=Newton, object 1 (Butlin 306) "Newton"|date=25 September 2013|publisher=[[William Blake Archive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Newton and [[Robert Boyle]]'s approach to the [[mechanical philosophy]] was promoted by [[rationalist]] pamphleteers as a viable alternative to the [[pantheism|pantheists]] and [[enthusiasm|enthusiasts]], and was accepted hesitantly by orthodox preachers as well as dissident preachers like the [[latitudinarian]]s.&lt;ref name="The Newtonians and the English Revolution: 1689–1720"/&gt; The clarity and simplicity of science was seen as a way to combat the emotional and [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] superlatives of both [[superstition|superstitious]] enthusiasm and the threat of [[atheism]],&lt;ref name="Science and Religion in Seventeenth-Century England"/&gt; and at the same time, the second wave of English [[deism|deists]] used Newton's discoveries to demonstrate the possibility of a "Natural Religion".

The attacks made against pre-[[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] "magical thinking", and the [[Christian mysticism|mystical elements of Christianity]], were given their foundation with Boyle's mechanical conception of the Universe. Newton gave Boyle's ideas their completion through [[mathematical proof]]s and, perhaps more importantly, was very successful in popularising them.&lt;ref name="Enlightenment and Religion: Rational Dissent in eighteenth-century Britain"/&gt;

===Occult===
{{See also|Isaac Newton's occult studies|eschatology}}

In a manuscript he wrote in 1704 (never intended to be published) he mentions the date of 2060, but it is not given as a date for the end of days. It has been falsely reported as a prediction.&lt;ref name="Snobelan"/&gt;  The passage is clear, when the date is read in context. He was against date setting for the end of days, concerned that this would put Christianity into disrepute.

"So then the time times &amp; half a time {{sic}} are 42 months or 1260 days or three years &amp; an half, recconing twelve months to a year &amp; 30 days to a month as was done in the Calender {{sic}} of the primitive year. And the days of short lived Beasts being put for the years of [long-]lived kingdoms the period of 1260 days, if dated from the complete conquest of the three kings A.C. 800, will end 2060. It may end later, but I see no reason for its ending sooner."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grayling|first1=A.

"This I mention not to assert when the time of the end shall be, but to put a stop to the rash conjectures of fanciful men who are frequently predicting the time of the end, and by doing so bring the sacred prophesies into discredit as often as their predictions fail. Christ comes as a thief in the night, and it is not for us to know the times and seasons which God hath put into his own breast."&lt;ref name="Papers Show Isaac Newton's Religious Side, Predict Date of Apocalypse"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Snobelan"&gt;[https://newtonprojectca.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/reply-to-tom-harpur-2-page-full-version.pdf Isaac Newton and Apocalypse Now: a response to Tom Harpur’s “Newton’s strange bedfellows”] Stephen D.

Swords (1793) page 431: "The Beginning of the reign of Antichrist.] The best interpreters (as Mr. Fleming, Sir I. Newton, Mr. Lowman, Dr. Doddridge, Bp. Newton, and Mr. Reader) are pretty well agreed that this reign is to be dated from about A. D. 756, when the Pope began to be a temporal power, (that is, in prophetic language, a beast) by assuming temporal dominion; 1260 years from this period will bring us to about A. D. 2000, and about the 6000th year of the world, which agrees with a tradition at least as ancient as the epistle ascribed to the apostle Barnabas (f 15.] which says, that "in six thousand years shall all things be accomplished."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alchemy===
In the character of Morton Opperly in "Poor Superman" (1951), speculative fiction author [[Fritz Leiber]] says of Newton, "Everyone knows Newton as the great scientist. Few remember that he spent half his life muddling with alchemy, looking for the [[philosopher's stone]].

Of an estimated ten million words of writing in Newton's papers, about one million deal with [[alchemy]]. Many of Newton's writings on alchemy are copies of other manuscripts, with his own annotations.&lt;ref name="Mann"/&gt; Alchemical texts mix artisanal knowledge with philosophical speculation, often hidden behind layers of wordplay, allegory, and imagery to protect craft secrets.&lt;ref name="Meyer"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Meyer|first1=Michal|title=Gold, secrecy and prestige|journal=Chemical Heritage Magazine|date=2014|volume=32|issue=1|pages=42–43|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/gold-secrecy-and-prestige|accessdate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the content contained in Newton's papers could have been considered heretical by the church.&lt;ref name="Mann"/&gt;

In 1888, after spending sixteen years cataloging Newton's papers, Cambridge University kept a small number and returned the rest to the Earl of Portsmouth. In 1936, a descendant offered the papers for sale at Sotheby's.&lt;ref name="Kean"/&gt; The collection was broken up and sold for a total of about £9,000.&lt;ref name="Greshko"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greshko|first1=Michael|title=Isaac Newton's Lost Alchemy Recipe Rediscovered|journal=National Geographic|date=4 April 2016|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/04/160404-isaac-newton-alchemy-mercury-recipe-chemistry-science/}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Maynard Keynes]] was one of about three dozen bidders who obtained part of the collection at auction.

All of Newton's known writings on alchemy are currently being put online in a project undertaken by [[Indiana University]]: "The Chymistry of Isaac Newton".&lt;ref name="Indiana"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Chymistry of Isaac Newton|url=http://webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu/newton/|website=Indiana University, Bloomington|accessdate=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Newton's fundamental contributions to science include the quantification of gravitational attraction, the discovery that white light is actually a mixture of immutable spectral colors, and the formulation of the calculus. Yet there is another, more mysterious side to Newton that is imperfectly known, a realm of activity that spanned some thirty years of his life, although he kept it largely hidden from his contemporaries and colleagues. We refer to Newton's involvement in the discipline of alchemy, or as it was often called in seventeenth-century England, "chymistry."&lt;ref name="Indiana"/&gt;}}

==Enlightenment philosophers==
[[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] philosophers chose a short history of scientific predecessors&amp;nbsp;– Galileo, Boyle, and Newton principally&amp;nbsp;– as the guides and guarantors of their applications of the singular concept of [[nature]] and [[natural law]] to every physical and social field of the day. In this respect, the lessons of history and the social structures built upon it could be discarded.&lt;ref&gt;Cassels, Alan. Ideology and International Relations in the Modern World. p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was Newton's conception of the universe based upon natural and rationally understandable laws that became one of the seeds for Enlightenment ideology.&lt;ref&gt;"Although it was just one of the many factors in the Enlightment, the success of Newtonian physics in providing a mathematical description of an ordered world clearly played a big part in the flowering of this movement in the eighteenth century" by John Gribbin,  ''Science: A History 1543–2001'' (2002), p. 241&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Locke and [[Voltaire]] applied concepts of natural law to political systems advocating intrinsic rights; the [[physiocrat]]s and [[Adam Smith]] applied natural conceptions of [[psychology]] and self-interest to economic systems; and [[sociology|sociologists]] criticised the current [[social order]] for trying to fit history into natural models of [[progress (history)|progress]]. [[Monboddo]] and [[Samuel Clarke]] resisted elements of Newton's work, but eventually rationalised it to conform with their strong religious views of nature.

Newton himself often told the story that he was inspired to formulate his theory of gravitation by watching the fall of an apple from a tree.{{sfn|White|1997|p=86}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

&lt;/ref&gt; Although it has been said that the apple story is a myth and that he did not arrive at his theory of gravity in any single moment,&lt;ref name="Berkun2010"/&gt; acquaintances of Newton (such as [[William Stukeley]], whose manuscript account of 1752 has been made available by the Royal Society) do in fact confirm the incident, though not the apocryphal version that the apple actually hit Newton's head. Stukeley recorded in his ''Memoirs of Sir Isaac Newton's Life'' a conversation with Newton in Kensington on 15 April 1726:&lt;ref name="Newton's apple: The real story"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hamblyn (2011)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NP"&gt;{{cite web|title=Revised Memoir of Newton (Normalized Version)|url=http://www.newtonproject.ox.ac.uk/view/texts/normalized/OTHE00001|website=The Newton Project|accessdate=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|we went into the garden, &amp; drank thea under the shade of some appletrees, only he, &amp; myself. amidst other discourse, he told me, he was just in the same situation, as when formerly, the notion of gravitation came into his mind. "why should that apple always descend perpendicularly to the ground," thought he to him self: occasion'd by the fall of an apple, as he sat in a comtemplative mood: "why should it not go sideways, or upwards? but constantly to the earths centre? assuredly, the reason is, that the earth draws it. there must be a drawing power in matter. &amp; the sum of the drawing power in the matter of the earth must be in the earths center, not in any side of the earth. therefore dos this apple fall perpendicularly, or toward the center. if matter thus draws matter; it must be in proportion of its quantity. therefore the apple draws the earth, as well as the earth draws the apple."&lt;!-- Please do not correct the spelling in this quotation, which is as per the cited source. --&gt;}}

John Conduitt, Newton's assistant at the Royal Mint and husband of Newton's niece, also described the event when he wrote about Newton's life:&lt;ref name="Keynes Ms. 130.4:Conduitt's account of Newton's life at Cambridge"/&gt;

{{Quotation|In the year 1666 he retired again from Cambridge to his mother in Lincolnshire. Whilst he was pensively meandering in a garden it came into his thought that the power of gravity (which brought an apple from a tree to the ground) was not limited to a certain distance from earth, but that this power must extend much further than was usually thought. Why not as high as the Moon said he to himself &amp; if so, that must influence her motion &amp; perhaps retain her in her orbit, whereupon he fell a calculating what would be the effect of that supposition.}}

In similar terms, [[Voltaire]] wrote in his ''Essay on Epic Poetry'' (1727), "Sir Isaac Newton walking in his gardens, had the first thought of his system of gravitation, upon seeing an apple falling from a tree."

It is known from his notebooks that Newton was grappling in the late 1660s with the idea that terrestrial gravity extends, in an inverse-square proportion, to the Moon; however it took him two decades to develop the full-fledged theory.&lt;ref&gt;I. Bernard Cohen and George E. Smith, eds. ''The Cambridge Companion to Newton'' (2002) p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; The question was not whether gravity existed, but whether it extended so far from Earth that it could also be the force holding the Moon to its orbit. Newton showed that if the force decreased as the inverse square of the distance, one could indeed calculate the Moon's orbital period, and get good agreement. He guessed the same force was responsible for other orbital motions, and hence named it "universal gravitation".

Various trees are claimed to be "the" apple tree which Newton describes. The King's School, Grantham, claims that the tree was purchased by the school, uprooted and transported to the headmaster's garden some years later. The staff of the (now) [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]]-owned [[Woolsthorpe Manor]] dispute this, and claim that a tree present in their gardens is the one described by Newton. A descendant of the original tree&lt;ref&gt;Alberto A. Martinez ''Science Secrets: The Truth about Darwin's Finches, Einstein's Wife, and Other Myths'', page 69 (University of Pittsburgh Press, 2011); {{isbn|978-0-8229-4407-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; can be seen growing outside the main gate of Trinity College, Cambridge, below the room Newton lived in when he studied there.

&lt;ref name="OSNS"&gt;During Newton's lifetime, two calendars were in use in Europe: the [[Julian Calendar|Julian]] ("[[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style]]") calendar in [[Protestantism|Protestant]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] regions, including Britain; and the [[Gregorian Calendar|Gregorian]] ("[[Old Style and New Style dates|New Style]]") calendar in Roman Catholic Europe. At Newton's birth, Gregorian dates were ten days ahead of Julian dates: thus his birth is recorded as taking place on 25 December 1642 Old Style, but can be converted to a New Style (modern) date of 4 January 1643. By the time of his death, the difference between the calendars had increased to eleven days: moreover, he died in the period after the start of the New Style year on 1 January, but before that of the Old Style new year on 25 March. His death occurred on 20 March 1726 according to the Old Style calendar, but the year is usually adjusted to 1727. A full conversion to New Style gives the date 31 March 1727.

In mathematics, the '''isoperimetric inequality''' is a [[geometry|geometric]] [[inequality (mathematics)|inequality]] involving the surface area of a set and its volume. In &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional space &lt;math&gt;\R^n&lt;/math&gt; the inequality lower bounds the [[surface area]] &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{surf}(S)&lt;/math&gt; of a set &lt;math&gt;S\subset\R^n&lt;/math&gt; by its [[volume]] &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{vol}(S)&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{surf}(S)\geq n \mathrm{vol}(S)^{\frac{n-1}{n}}\mathrm{vol}(B_1)^{\frac{1}{n}}&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;B_1\subset\R^n&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Unit sphere|unit ball]]. The equality holds when &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is a ball in &lt;math&gt;\R^n&lt;/math&gt;.

On a plane, i.e. when &lt;math&gt;n=2&lt;/math&gt;, the isoperimetric inequality relates square of the [[circumference]] of a [[closed curve]] and the [[area]] of a plane region it encloses. ''[[wikt:isoperimetric#English|Isoperimetric]]'' literally means "having the same [[perimeter]]". Specifically in &lt;math&gt;\R ^2&lt;/math&gt;, the isoperimetric inequality states, for the length ''L'' of a closed curve and the area ''A'' of the planar region that it encloses, that

:&lt;math&gt;4\pi A \le L^2,&lt;/math&gt;

and that equality holds if and only if the curve is a circle.

The '''isoperimetric problem''' is to determine a [[plane figure]] of the largest possible area whose [[boundary (topology)|boundary]] has a specified length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Blåsjö, Viktor|title=The Evolution of the Isoperimetric Problem|journal=Amer. Math. Monthly|volume=112|year=2005|pages=526–566|doi=10.2307/30037526|url=http://www.maa.org/programs/maa-awards/writing-awards/the-evolution-of-the-isoperimetric-problem}}&lt;/ref&gt; The closely related ''Dido's problem'' asks for a region of the maximal area bounded by a straight line and a curvilinear [[arc (geometry)|arc]] whose endpoints belong to that line. It is named after [[Dido (Queen of Carthage)|Dido]], the legendary founder and first queen of [[Carthage]]. The solution to the isoperimetric problem is given by a [[circle]] and was known already in [[Ancient Greece]]. However, the first mathematically rigorous proof of this fact was obtained only in the 19th century. Since then, many other proofs have been found.

The isoperimetric problem has been extended in multiple ways, for example, to curves on [[differential geometry of surfaces|surfaces]] and to regions in higher-dimensional spaces. Perhaps the most familiar physical manifestation of the 3-dimensional isoperimetric inequality is the shape of a drop of water. Namely, a drop will typically assume a symmetric round shape. Since the amount of water in a drop is fixed, [[surface tension]] forces the drop into a shape which minimizes the surface area of the drop, namely a round sphere.

== The isoperimetric problem in the plane ==
[[File:Isoperimetric inequality illustr1.svg|right|thumb|If a region is not convex, a "dent" in its boundary can be "flipped" to increase the area of the region while keeping the perimeter unchanged.]]
[[File:Isoperimetric inequality illustr2.svg|right|thumb|An elongated shape can be made more round while keeping its perimeter fixed and increasing its area.]]

The classical ''isoperimetric problem'' dates back to antiquity. The problem can be stated as follows: Among all closed [[curve]]s in the plane of fixed perimeter, which curve (if any) maximizes the area of its enclosed region? This question can be shown to be equivalent to the following problem: Among all closed curves in the plane enclosing a fixed area, which curve (if any) minimizes the perimeter?

This problem is conceptually related to the [[principle of least action]] in [[physics]], in that it can be restated: what is the principle of action which encloses the greatest area, with the greatest economy of effort? The 15th-century philosopher and scientist, Cardinal [[Nicholas of Cusa]], considered [[rotation]]al action, the process by which a [[circle]] is generated, to be the most direct reflection, in the realm of sensory impressions, of the process by which the universe is created. German astronomer and astrologer [[Johannes Kepler]] invoked the isoperimetric principle in discussing the morphology of the solar system, in ''[[Mysterium Cosmographicum]]'' (''The Sacred Mystery of the Cosmos'', 1596).

Although the circle appears to be an obvious solution to the problem, proving this fact is rather difficult. The first progress toward the solution was made by Swiss geometer [[Jakob Steiner]] in 1838, using a geometric method later named [[Symmetrization methods#Steiner Symmetrization|''Steiner symmetrisation'']].&lt;ref&gt;J. Steiner, ''Einfacher Beweis der isoperimetrischen Hauptsätze'', J. reine angew Math. '''18''', (1838), pp. 281&amp;ndash;296; and Gesammelte Werke Vol. 2, pp. 77&amp;ndash;91, Reimer, Berlin, (1882).&lt;/ref&gt; Steiner showed that if a solution existed, then it must be the circle. Steiner's proof was completed later by several other mathematicians.

Steiner begins with some geometric constructions which are easily understood; for example, it can be shown that any closed curve enclosing a region that is not fully [[Convex set|convex]] can be modified to enclose more area, by "flipping" the concave areas so that they become convex. It can further be shown that any closed curve which is not fully symmetrical can be "tilted" so that it encloses more area. The one shape that is perfectly convex and symmetrical is the circle, although this, in itself, does not represent a rigorous proof of the isoperimetric theorem (see external links).

== On a plane ==
The solution to the isoperimetric problem is usually expressed in the form of an [[inequality (mathematics)|inequality]] that relates the length ''L'' of a closed curve and the area ''A'' of the planar region that it encloses. The '''isoperimetric inequality''' states that

:&lt;math&gt;4\pi A \le L^2,&lt;/math&gt;

and that the equality holds if and only if the curve is a circle. The [[area of a disk]] of radius ''R'' is ''πR''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and the circumference of the circle is 2''πR'', so both sides of the inequality are equal to 4''π''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''R''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in this case.

Dozens of proofs of the isoperimetric inequality have been found. In 1902, [[Adolf Hurwitz|Hurwitz]] published a short proof using the [[Fourier series]] that applies to arbitrary [[rectifiable curve]]s (not assumed to be smooth). An elegant direct proof based on comparison of a smooth simple closed curve with an appropriate circle was given by E. Schmidt in 1938. It uses only the [[arc length]] formula, expression for the area of a plane region from [[Green's theorem]], and the [[Cauchy–Schwarz inequality]].

For a given closed curve, the '''isoperimetric quotient''' is defined as the ratio of its area and that of the circle having the same perimeter. This is equal to

:&lt;math&gt;Q=\frac{4\pi A}{L^2}&lt;/math&gt;

and the isoperimetric inequality says that ''Q'' ≤ 1. Equivalently, the [[isoperimetric ratio]] {{math|''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/''A''}} is at least 4{{pi}} for every curve.

The isoperimetric quotient of a regular ''n''-gon is

:&lt;math&gt;Q_n=\frac{\pi}{n \tan \tfrac{\pi}{n}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; be a smooth regular convex closed curve. Then the '''improved isoperimetric inequality''' states the following

:&lt;math&gt;L^2\geqslant 4\pi A+8\pi\left|\widetilde{A}_{0.5}\right|,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;L, A, \widetilde{A}_{0.5}&lt;/math&gt; denote the length of &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;, the area of the region bounded by &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; and the oriented area of the [[Wigner caustic]] of &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;, respectively, and the equality holds if and only if &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is a [[curve of constant width]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022247X16301585 | title = The improved isoperimetric inequality and the Wigner caustic of planar ovals | first = Michał | last = Zwierzyński | journal = J.

== On a sphere ==

Let ''C'' be a simple closed curve on a [[sphere]] of radius 1. Denote by ''L'' the length of ''C'' and by ''A'' the area enclosed by ''C''. The '''spherical isoperimetric inequality''' states that

:&lt;math&gt;L^2 \ge A (4\pi - A),&lt;/math&gt;

and that the equality holds if and only if the curve is a circle. There are, in fact, two ways to measure the spherical area enclosed by a simple closed curve, but the inequality is symmetric with the respect to taking the complement.

This inequality was discovered by [[Paul Lévy (mathematician)|Paul Lévy]] (1919) who also extended it to higher dimensions and general surfaces.

In the more general case of arbitrary radius ''R'', it is known &lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Osserman|Osserman, Robert]]. "The Isoperimetric Inequality." Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society. 84.6 (1978) http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/1978-84-06/S0002-9904-1978-14553-4/S0002-9904-1978-14553-4.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; that

:&lt;math&gt;L^2\ge 4\pi A - \frac{A^2}{R^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

== In &lt;math&gt;\R^n&lt;/math&gt; ==
The isoperimetric inequality states that a [[sphere]] has the smallest surface area per given volume. Given a set &lt;math&gt;S\subset\R ^n&lt;/math&gt; with [[surface area]] &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{surf}(S)&lt;/math&gt; and [[volume]] &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{vol}(S)&lt;/math&gt;, the isoperimetric inequality states

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{surf}(S)\geq n \mathrm{vol}(S)^{\frac{n-1}{n}}\mathrm{vol}(B_1)^{\frac{1}{n}}&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;B_1\subset\R ^n&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Unit sphere|unit ball]]. The equality holds when &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is a ball in &lt;math&gt;\R ^n&lt;/math&gt;.

The proof on the inequality follows directly from [[Brunn–Minkowski theorem|Brunn–Minkowski inequality]] between a set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; and a ball with radius &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. &lt;math&gt;B_\epsilon=\epsilon B_1&lt;/math&gt;. By taking Brunn–Minkowski inequality to the power &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, subtracting &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{vol}(S)&lt;/math&gt; from both sides, dividing them by &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;, and taking the limit as &lt;math&gt;\epsilon\to 0.&lt;/math&gt; ({{harvtxt|Osserman|1978}}; {{harvtxt|Federer|1969|loc=§3.2.43}}).

In full generality {{harv|Federer|1969|loc=§3.2.43}}, the isoperimetric inequality states that for any set &lt;math&gt;S\subset\R^n&lt;/math&gt; whose [[closure of a set|closure]] has finite [[Lebesgue measure]]

:&lt;math&gt;n\omega_n^{\frac{1}{n}} L^n(\bar{S})^{\frac{n-1}{n}} \le M^{n-1}_*(\partial S)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;M_*^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt; is the (''n''-1)-dimensional [[Minkowski content]], ''L&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' is the ''n''-dimensional Lebesgue measure, and ''ω&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the volume of the [[unit ball]] in &lt;math&gt;\R^n&lt;/math&gt;. If the boundary of ''S'' is [[rectifiable curve|rectifiable]], then the Minkowski content is the (''n''-1)-dimensional [[Hausdorff measure]].

The ''n''-dimensional isoperimetric inequality is equivalent (for sufficiently smooth domains) to the [[Sobolev inequality]] on &lt;math&gt;\R^n&lt;/math&gt; with optimal constant:

:&lt;math&gt;\left( \int_{\R^n} |u|^{\frac{n}{n-1}}\right)^{\frac{n-1}{n}} \le n^{-1}\omega_{n}^{-\frac{1}{n}}\int_{\R^n}|\nabla u|&lt;/math&gt;

for all &lt;math&gt;u\in W^{1,1}(\R^n)&lt;/math&gt;.

==In a metric measure space==

Most of the work on isoperimetric problem has been done in the context of smooth regions in [[Euclidean space]]s, or more generally, in [[Riemannian manifold]]s. However, the isoperimetric problem can be formulated in much greater generality, using the notion of ''Minkowski content''. Let &lt;math&gt;(X, \mu, d)&lt;/math&gt; be a ''metric measure space'': ''X'' is a [[metric space]] with [[metric (mathematics)|metric]] ''d'', and ''μ'' is a [[Borel measure]] on ''X''. The ''boundary measure'', or [[Minkowski content]], of a [[measurable]] subset ''A'' of ''X'' is defined as the [[lim inf]]

: &lt;math&gt;\mu^+(A) = \liminf_{\varepsilon \to 0+} \frac{\mu(A_\varepsilon) - \mu(A)}{\varepsilon},&lt;/math&gt;

where

: &lt;math&gt;A_\varepsilon = \{ x \in X | d(x, A) \leq \varepsilon \}&lt;/math&gt;

is the ε-''extension'' of ''A''.

The isoperimetric problem in ''X'' asks how small can &lt;math&gt;\mu^+(A)&lt;/math&gt; be for a given ''μ''(''A''). If ''X'' is the [[plane (mathematics)|Euclidean plane]] with the usual distance and the [[Lebesgue measure]] then this question generalizes the classical isoperimetric problem to planar regions whose boundary is not necessarily smooth, although the answer turns out to be the same.

The function

:&lt;math&gt;I(a) = \inf \{ \mu^+(A) | \mu(A) = a\}&lt;/math&gt;

is called the ''isoperimetric profile'' of the metric measure space &lt;math&gt;(X, \mu, d)&lt;/math&gt;. Isoperimetric profiles have been studied for [[Cayley graph]]s of [[discrete group]]s and for special classes of Riemannian manifolds (where usually only regions ''A'' with regular boundary are considered).

== For graphs ==

{{main|Expander graph}}

In [[graph theory]], isoperimetric inequalities are at the heart of the study of [[expander graphs]], which are [[sparse graph]]s that have strong connectivity properties. Expander constructions have spawned research in pure and applied mathematics, with several applications to [[Computational complexity theory|complexity theory]], design of robust [[computer network]]s, and the theory of [[error-correcting code]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hoory|Linial|Widgerson|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Isoperimetric inequalities for graphs relate the size of vertex subsets to the size of their boundary, which is usually measured by the number of edges leaving the subset (edge expansion) or by the number of neighbouring vertices (vertex expansion). For a graph &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and a number &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, the following are two standard isoperimetric parameters for graphs.&lt;ref&gt;Definitions 4.2 and 4.3 of {{harvtxt|Hoory|Linial|Widgerson|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*The edge isoperimetric parameter: 
::&lt;math&gt;\Phi_E(G,k)=\min_{S\subseteq V} \left\{|E(S,\overline{S})| : |S|=k \right\}&lt;/math&gt;
*The vertex isoperimetric parameter: 
::&lt;math&gt;\Phi_V(G,k)=\min_{S\subseteq V} \left\{|\Gamma(S)\setminus S| : |S|=k \right\}&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;E(S,\overline{S})&lt;/math&gt; denotes the set of edges leaving &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Gamma(S)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the set of vertices that have a neighbour in &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;. The isoperimetric problem consists of understanding how the parameters &lt;math&gt;\Phi_E&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Phi_V&lt;/math&gt; behave for natural families of graphs.

=== Example: Isoperimetric inequalities for hypercubes ===
The &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional [[hypercube]] &lt;math&gt;Q_d&lt;/math&gt; is the graph whose vertices are all Boolean vectors of length &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;, that is, the set &lt;math&gt;\{0,1\}^d&lt;/math&gt;. Two such vectors are connected by an edge in &lt;math&gt;Q_d&lt;/math&gt; if they are equal up to a single bit flip, that is, their [[Hamming distance]] is exactly one.
The following are the isoperimetric inequalities for the Boolean hypercube.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvtxt|Bollobás|1986}} and Section 4 in {{harvtxt|Hoory|Linial|Widgerson|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Edge isoperimetric inequality ====
The edge isoperimetric inequality of the hypercube is &lt;math&gt;\Phi_E(Q_d,k) \geq k(d-\log_2 k)&lt;/math&gt;. This bound is tight, as is witnessed by each set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; that is the set of vertices of any subcube of &lt;math&gt;Q_d&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Vertex isoperimetric inequality ====
Harper's theorem&lt;ref&gt;Cf. {{harvtxt|Calabro|2004}} or {{harvtxt|Bollobás|1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; says that ''Hamming balls'' have the smallest vertex boundary among all sets of a given size. Hamming balls are sets that contain all points of [[Hamming weight]] at most &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; and no points of Hamming weight larger than &lt;math&gt;r+1&lt;/math&gt; for some integer &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;. This theorem implies that any set &lt;math&gt;S\subseteq V&lt;/math&gt; with 

:&lt;math&gt;|S|\geq\sum_{i=0}^{r} {d\choose i}&lt;/math&gt; 

satisfies 

:&lt;math&gt;|S\cup\Gamma(S)|\geq \sum_{i=0}^{r+1}{d\choose i}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;cf. {{harvtxt|Leader|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a special case, consider set sizes &lt;math&gt;k=|S|&lt;/math&gt; of the form 

:&lt;math&gt;k={d \choose 0} + {d \choose 1} + \dots + {d \choose r}&lt;/math&gt; 

for some integer &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;. Then the above implies that the exact vertex isoperimetric parameter is 

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi_V(Q_d,k) = {d\choose r+1}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Also stated in {{harvtxt|Hoory|Linial|Widgerson|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Isoperimetric inequality for triangles==

The isoperimetric inequality for triangles in terms of perimeter ''p'' and area ''T'' states that&lt;ref name=Chakerian&gt;Chakerian, G. D. "A Distorted View of Geometry." Ch. 7 in ''Mathematical Plums'' (R. Honsberger, editor). Washington, DC: Mathematical Association of America, 1979: 147.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2325779/the-isoperimetric-inequality-for-triangles/]&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;p^2 \ge 12\sqrt{3} \cdot T,&lt;/math&gt;

with equality for the [[equilateral triangle]]. This is implied, via the [[inequality of arithmetic and geometric means|AM-GM inequality]], by a stronger inequality which has also been called the isoperimetric inequality for triangles:&lt;ref&gt;Dragutin Svrtan and Darko Veljan, "Non-Euclidean Versions of Some Classical Triangle Inequalities", ''Forum Geometricorum'' 12, 2012, 197–209. http://forumgeom.fau.edu/FG2012volume12/FG201217.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;T \le \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}(abc)^{\frac{2}{3}}.&lt;/math&gt;

For a connected [[CW complex]] ''X'', the James reduced product ''J''(''X'') has the same homotopy type as ΩΣ''X'', the [[loop space]] of the [[Suspension (topology)|suspension]] of ''X''.

The commutative analogue of the James reduced product is called the [[infinite symmetric product]].

[[File:Kawasaki's theorem.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|In this example, the alternating sum of angles (clockwise from the bottom) is 90° &amp;minus; 45° + 22.5° &amp;minus; 22.5° + 45° &amp;minus; 90° + 22.5° &amp;minus; 22.5° = 0°. Since it adds to zero, the crease pattern may be flat-folded.]]
'''Kawasaki's theorem''' is a [[theorem]] in the [[mathematics of paper folding]] that describes the [[crease pattern]]s with a single [[Vertex (geometry)|vertex]] that may be folded to form a flat figure. It states that the pattern is flat-foldable if and only if alternatingly adding and subtracting the angles of consecutive folds around the vertex gives an [[alternating series|alternating sum]] of zero.
Crease patterns with more than one vertex do not obey such a simple criterion, and are [[NP-hard]] to fold.

The theorem is named after one of its discoverers, [[Toshikazu Kawasaki]]. However, several others also contributed to its discovery, and it is sometimes called the '''Kawasaki–Justin theorem''' or '''Husimi's theorem''' after other contributors, Jacques Justin and [[Kôdi Husimi]].&lt;ref&gt;The name "Yasuji Husimi" appearing in {{harvtxt|Kawasaki|2005}} and sometimes associated with this theorem is a mistranslation of the kanji "康治" in Kôdi Husimi's name.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Statement of the theorem ==
A one-vertex [[crease pattern]] consists of a set of [[Ray (geometry)|ray]]s or creases drawn on a flat sheet of paper, all emanating from the same point interior to the sheet. (This point is called the vertex of the pattern.) Each crease must be folded, but the pattern does not specify whether the folds should be [[mountain fold]]s or [[valley fold]]s. The goal is to determine whether it is possible to fold the paper so that every crease is folded, no folds occur elsewhere, and the whole folded sheet of paper lies flat.{{r|hull02}}

To fold flat, the number of creases must be even. This follows, for instance, from [[Maekawa's theorem]], which states that the number of mountain folds at a flat-folded vertex differs from the number of valley folds  by exactly two folds.{{r|hull}} Therefore, suppose that a crease pattern consists of an even number {{math|2''n''}} of creases, and let {{math|α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ⋯, α&lt;sub&gt;2''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} be the consecutive angles between the creases around the vertex, in clockwise order, starting at any one of the angles. Then Kawasaki's theorem states that the crease pattern may be folded flat if and only if the [[Alternating series|alternating sum and difference]] of the angles adds to zero:

:{{math|1=α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;minus; α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; +  α&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;minus; ⋯ + α&lt;sub&gt;2''n'' &amp;minus; 1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;minus; α&lt;sub&gt;2''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = 0}}

An equivalent way of stating the same condition is that, if the angles are partitioned into two alternating subsets, then the sum of the angles in either of the two subsets is exactly 180 degrees.{{r|charm}} However, this equivalent form applies only to a crease pattern on a flat piece of paper, whereas the alternating sum form of the condition remains valid for crease patterns on conical sheets of paper with nonzero [[Defect (geometry)|defect]] at the vertex.{{r|hull02}}

==Local and global flat-foldability==
Kawasaki's theorem, applied to each of the vertices of an arbitrary crease pattern, determines whether the crease pattern is locally [[Flat-foldability|flat-foldable]], meaning that the part of the crease pattern near the vertex can be flat-folded. However, there exist crease patterns that are locally flat-foldable but that have no global flat folding that works for the whole crease pattern at once.{{r|hull}} {{harvs|first=Tom|last=Hull|authorlink=Tom Hull|year=1994|txt}} conjectured that global flat-foldability could be tested by checking Kawasaki's theorem at each vertex of a crease pattern, and then also testing [[bipartite graph|bipartiteness]] of an [[undirected graph]] associated with the crease pattern.{{r|hull94}} However, this conjecture was disproven by {{harvtxt|Bern|Hayes|1996}}, who showed that Hull's conditions are not sufficient. More strongly, Bern and Hayes showed that the problem of testing global flat-foldability is [[NP-complete]].{{r|bh96}}

==Proof==
To show that Kawasaki's condition necessarily holds for any flat-folded figure, it suffices to observe that, at each fold, the orientation of the paper is reversed. Thus, if the first crease in the flat-folded figure is placed in the plane parallel to the {{mvar|x}}-axis, the next crease must be rotated from it by an angle of {{math|α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, the crease after that by an angle of {{math|α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;minus; α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} (because the second angle has the reverse orientation from the first), etc. In order for the paper to meet back up with itself at the final angle, Kawasaki's condition must be met.{{r|hull|charm|roses|6.849}}

Showing that the condition is also a [[sufficient condition]] is a matter of describing how to fold a given crease pattern so that it folds flat. That is, one must show how to choose whether to make mountain or valley folds, and in what order the flaps of paper should be arranged on top of each other. One way to do this is to choose a number {{mvar|i}} such that the partial alternating sum
:{{math|1=α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;minus; α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; +  α&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;minus; ⋯ + α&lt;sub&gt;2''i'' &amp;minus; 1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;minus; α&lt;sub&gt;2''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}}
is as small as possible. Either {{math|1=''i'' = 0}} and the partial sum is an [[empty sum]] that is also zero, or for some nonzero choice of {{mvar|i}} the partial sum is negative. Then, accordion fold the pattern, starting with angle {{math|α&lt;sub&gt;2''i'' + 1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and alternating between mountain and valley folds, placing each angular wedge of the paper below the previous folds. At each step until the final fold, an accordion fold of this type will never self-intersect. The choice of {{mvar|i}} ensures that the first wedge sticks out to the left of all the other folded pieces of paper, allowing the final wedge to connect back up to it.{{r|hull94}}

An alternative proof of sufficiency can be used to show that there are many different flat foldings. Consider the smallest angle {{math|α&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and the two creases on either side of it. Mountain-fold one of these two creases and valley-fold the other, choosing arbitrarily which fold to use for which crease. Then, glue the resulting flap of paper onto the remaining part of the crease pattern. The result of this gluing will be a crease pattern with two fewer creases, on a conical sheet of paper, that still satisfies Kawasaki's condition. Therefore, by [[mathematical induction]], repeating this process will eventually lead to a flat folding. The base case of the induction is a cone with only two creases and two equal-angle wedges, which can obviously be flat-folded by using a mountain fold for both creases. There are two ways to choose which folds to use in each step of this method, and each step eliminates two creases. Therefore, any crease pattern with {{math|2''n''}} creases that satisfies Kawasaki's condition has at least {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} different choices of mountain and valley folds that all lead to valid flat foldings.{{r|hull03}}

==History==
In the late 1970s, [[Kôdi Husimi]] and [[David A. Huffman]] independently observed that flat-folded figures with four creases have opposite angles adding to {{pi}}, a special case of Kawasaki's theorem.{{r|hull10|nyt}} Huffman included the result in a 1976 paper on curved creases,{{r|huffman}} and
Husimi published the four-crease theorem in a book on origami geometry with his wife Mitsue Husimi.{{r|husimi}}
The same result was published even earlier, in a pair of papers from 1966 by S. Murata that also included the six-crease case and the general case of [[Maekawa's theorem]].{{r|murata}}

The fact that crease patterns with arbitrarily many creases necessarily have alternating sums of angles adding to {{pi}} was discovered by Kawasaki, by Stuart Robertson, and by Jacques Justin (again, independently of each other) in the late 1970s and early 1980s.{{r|bh96|hull10|robertson|justin|tmto|k89}}
Because of Justin's contribution to the problem, Kawasaki's theorem has also been called the Kawasaki–Justin theorem.{{r|orourke}}
The fact that this condition is sufficient—that is, that crease patterns with evenly many angles, alternatingly summing to {{pi}} can always be flat-folded—may have been first stated by {{harvtxt|Hull|1994}}.{{r|hull94}}

Kawasaki himself has called the result '''Husimi's theorem''', after Kôdi Husimi, and some other authors have followed this terminology as well.{{r|roses|kaino}} The name "Kawasaki's theorem" was first given to this result in ''Origami for the Connoisseur'' by [[Kunihiko Kasahara]] and Toshie Takahama (Japan Publications, 1987).{{r|hull}}

{{harvtxt|Hull|2003}} credits the lower bound of {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} on the number of different flat-foldings of a crease pattern meeting the conditions of the theorem to independent work in the early 1990s by Azuma,{{r|azuma}} Justin,{{r|tmto}} and Ewins and Hull.{{r|hull03}}

Although Kawasaki's theorem completely describes the folding patterns that have flat-folded states, it does not describe the folding process needed to reach that state. For some folding patterns, it may be necessary to curve or bend the paper while transforming it from a flat sheet to its flat-folded state, rather than keeping the rest of the paper flat and only changing the [[dihedral angle]]s at each fold. For [[rigid origami]] (a type of folding that keeps the surface flat except at its folds, suitable for hinged panels of rigid material rather than flexible paper), additional conditions are needed on a folding pattern to allow it to move from an unfolded state to a flat-folded state.{{r|acdehklt}}

Newberger's formula generalizes a formula of this type proven by Lerche in 1966; Newberger discovered it independently. Lerche's formula has γ =1; both extend a standard rule for the summation of Bessel functions, and are useful in [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] physics.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5231">In [[logic]], statements &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; are '''logically equivalent''' if they have the same logical content. That is, if they have the same [[truth value]] in every [[model (logic)|model]] (Mendelson 1979:56). The logical equivalence of &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is sometimes expressed as &lt;math&gt;p \equiv q&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\textsf{E}pq&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;p \iff q&lt;/math&gt;.
However, these symbols are also used for [[material equivalence]]. Proper interpretation depends on the context. Logical equivalence is different from material equivalence, although the two concepts are closely related.

&lt;math&gt;p \iff q&lt;/math&gt;

Logical equivalences involving conditional statements：&lt;br /&gt;

:#&lt;math&gt;(p \implies r) \vee (q \implies r) \equiv (p \wedge q) \implies r&lt;/math&gt;

Logical equivalences involving biconditionals：&lt;br /&gt;
:#&lt;math&gt;p \iff q \equiv (p \implies q) \wedge (q \implies p)&lt;/math&gt;
:#&lt;math&gt;p \iff q \equiv \neg p \iff \neg q&lt;/math&gt;
:#&lt;math&gt;p \iff q \equiv (p \wedge q) \vee (\neg p \wedge \neg q)&lt;/math&gt;
:#&lt;math&gt;\neg (p \iff q) \equiv p \iff \neg q&lt;/math&gt;

==Example==
The following statements are logically equivalent:

#If Lisa is in [[France]], then she is in [[Europe]].  (In symbols, &lt;math&gt;f \implies e&lt;/math&gt;.)
#If Lisa is not in Europe, then she is not in France.  (In symbols, &lt;math&gt;\neg e \implies \neg f&lt;/math&gt;.)

Syntactically, (1) and (2) are derivable from each other via the rules of [[contraposition]] and [[double negation]].  Semantically, (1) and (2) are true in exactly the same models (interpretations, valuations); namely, those in which either ''Lisa is in France'' is false or ''Lisa is in Europe'' is true.

(Note that in this example [[classical logic]] is assumed.  Some [[non-classical logic]]s do not deem (1) and (2) logically equivalent.)

==Relation to material equivalence==

Logical equivalence is different from material equivalence. Formulas &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; are logically equivalent if and only if the statement of their material equivalence (&lt;math&gt;p \iff q&lt;/math&gt;)  is a tautology (Copi et at. 2014:348). 

The material equivalence of &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; (often written &lt;math&gt;p \iff q&lt;/math&gt;) is itself another statement in the same [[formal system|object language]] as &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;.  This statement expresses the idea "'&lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;'". In particular, the truth value of &lt;math&gt;p \iff q&lt;/math&gt; can change from one model to another.

The claim that two formulas are logically equivalent is a statement in the [[metalanguage]], expressing a relationship between two statements &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;.   The statements are logically equivalent if, in every model, they have the same truth value.

'''Ludwig Wittgenstein''' considered his chief contribution to philosophy to be in the '''[[philosophy of mathematics]]''', a topic to which he devoted much of his work between 1929 and 1944.&lt;ref name="stanford1"&gt;Roydich V, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wittgenstein-mathematics/ ''Wittgenstein's Philosophy of Mathematics''], The [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]&lt;/ref&gt; As with his [[philosophy of language]], Wittgenstein's views on mathematics evolved from the period of the [[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]], changing from [[logicism]] which was endorsed by his mentor [[Bertrand Russell]],  to a general [[anti-foundationalism]] and [[Constructivism (mathematics)|constructivism]] that was not readily accepted by the mathematical community. The main source in Wittgenstein's thinking on mathematics is the text compiled as ''[[Remarks on the Foundations of Mathematics]]'', which contains the late Wittgenstein's views, notably a controversial repudiation of [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]]. The success of Wittgenstein's general philosophy has tended to displace the real debates on more technical issues.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}

==Tractatus==

Wittgenstein's initial conception of mathematics was logicist and even [[Formalism (mathematics)|formalist]].&lt;ref name="stanford1"/&gt; The ''Tractatus''  described the propositions of logic as a series of tautologies derived from syntactic manipulation, and without the [[picture theory of language|pictorial]] force of [[elementary propositions]] depicting [[states of affairs]] obtaining in the world.

Wittgenstein asserted that “[t]he logic of the world, which is shown in tautologies by the propositions of logic, is shown in equations by mathematics” (6.22) and further that “Mathematics is a method of logic” (6.234).

==Philosophy of mathematics, post-1929==
During the 1920s Wittgenstein turned away from philosophical matters but his interest in mathematics was rekindled when he attended in Vienna a lecture by the [[intuitionism|intuitionist]] [[L. E. J. Brouwer]]. After 1929, his primary mathematical preoccupation entailed resolving the account of [[logical truth|logical necessity]] he had articulated in the [[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]—an issue which had been fiercely pressed by [[Frank P. Ramsey]].&lt;ref&gt;S. G. Shanker, (1987), ''Wittgenstein and the Turning Point in the Philosophy of Mathematics'', [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=wOR44vscOWEC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR10&amp;dq=wittgenstein+on+mathematics+tractatus&amp;ots=0Dd3CZcwV2&amp;sig=P6XLGgD4hlxzEIl0Qt6PTn-REx4#v=onepage&amp;q=wittgenstein%20on%20mathematics%20tractatus&amp;f=false], {{ISBN|978-0-88706-482-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wittgenstein's initial response, [[Some Remarks on Logical Form]], was the only academic paper he published during his lifetime, and marked the beginnings of a departure from the [[ideal language philosophy]] and [[correspondence theory of truth]] of the Tractatus.

==The Lectures on the Foundations of mathematics==
During the two terms of 1938/9 Wittgenstein lectured without any notes before students for two hours twice a week. From four sets of notes made during the lectures a text has been created, presenting Wittgenstein's views at that time.&lt;ref&gt;(1976), ''Wittgenstein’s Lectures on the Foundations of Mathematics'', ed. [[Cora Diamond]],  Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Remarks on the Foundations of mathematics (1937–44)==
An editorial team prepared the edition of Wittgenstein's Remarks on the Foundations of mathematics from the manuscript notes he made  during the years 1937-44. The material has been arranged in chronological order, allowing to observe some changes of emphasis or interest in Wittgenstein's views over the years.&lt;ref&gt;''Remarks on the Foundations of mathematics'' (1978)  Revised Edition, Oxford: Basil Blackwell, G.H. von Wright, R. Rhees and G.E.M. Anscombe (eds.); translated by G.E.M Anscombe.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[cryptography]], '''Master/Session''' is a [[key management]] scheme in which a pre-shared Key Encrypting Key (called the "Master" key) is used to encrypt a randomly generated and insecurely communicated Working Key (called the "Session" key). The Working Key is then used for encrypting the data to be exchanged. Its advantage is simplicity, but it suffers the disadvantage of having to communicate the pre-shared Key Exchange Key, which can be difficult to update in the event of compromise.

The Master/Session technique was created in the days before asymmetric techniques, such as [[Diffie–Hellman key exchange|Diffie-Hellman]], were invented. This technique still finds widespread use in the financial industry, and is routinely used between corporate parties such as issuers, acquirers, switches. Its use in device communications (such as [[PIN pad]]s), however, is in decline given the advantages of techniques such as [[Derived unique key per transaction|DUKPT]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.giac.org/paper/gsec/4068/3des-secure-pin-based-electronic-transaction-processing/106500|title=Global Information Assurance Certification Paper|publisher=[[SANS Institute]]|date=2004-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3757">In [[geometry]], '''minimax eversions''' are a class of [[sphere eversion]]s, constructed by using '''half-way models'''.

It is a [[calculus of variations|variational]] method, and consists of special homotopies (they are shortest paths with respect to [[Willmore energy]]); contrast with Thurston's corrugations, which are generic.

The original method of half-way models was not optimal: the regular homotopies passed through the midway models, but the path from the round sphere to the midway model was constructed by hand, and was not gradient ascent/descent.

Eversions via half-way models are called ''tobacco-pouch eversions'' by Francis and Morin.&lt;ref name="Carter2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=J. Scott Carter|title=An Excursion in Diagrammatic Algebra: Turning a Sphere from Red to Blue|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UWS6CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA17|year=2012|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=978-981-4374-50-7|pages=17–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Half-way models==
A half-way model is an immersion of the sphere &lt;math&gt;S^2&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\R^3&lt;/math&gt;, which is so-called because it is the half-way point of a [[sphere eversion]]. This class of eversions has time symmetry: the first half of the regular homotopy goes from the standard round sphere to the half-way model, and the second half (which goes from the half-way model to the inside-out sphere) is the same process in reverse.

==Explanation==
[[Rob Kusner]] proposed optimal eversions using the [[Willmore energy]] on the space of all [[immersion (mathematics)|immersions]] of the sphere &lt;math&gt;S^2&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^3&lt;/math&gt;.
The round sphere and the inside-out round sphere are the unique global minima for Willmore energy, and a minimax eversion is a path connecting these by passing over a [[saddle point]] (like traveling between two valleys via a mountain pass).&lt;ref name="Emmer2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michele Emmer|title=The Visual Mind II|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i2qnl1P9pyEC&amp;pg=PT485|year=2005|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-05076-0|pages=485–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kusner's half-way models are [[saddle point]]s for Willmore energy, arising (according to a theorem of Bryant) from certain complete minimal surfaces in 3-space; the minimax eversions consist of gradient ascent from the round sphere to the half-way model, then gradient descent down (gradient descent for Willmore energy is called [[Willmore flow]]). More symmetrically, start at the half-way model; push in one direction and follow Willmore flow down to a round sphere; push in the opposite direction and follow Willmore flow down to the inside-out round sphere.  

There are two families of half-way models (this observation is due to Francis and Morin):
* odd order: generalizing [[Boy's surface]]: 3-fold, 5-fold, etc., symmetry; half-way model is a double-covered [[projective plane]] (generically 2-1 immersed sphere).
* even order: generalizing [[Morin surface]]: 2-fold, 4-fold, etc., symmetry; half-way model is a generically 1-1 immersed sphere, and a twist by half a symmetry interchanges sheets of the sphere

==History==
The first explicit sphere eversion was by Shapiro and Phillips in the early 1960s, using [[Boy's surface]] as a half-way model. Later Morin discovered the [[Morin surface]] and used it to construct other sphere eversions. Kusner conceived the minimax eversions in the early 1980s: [http://torus.math.uiuc.edu/jms/Papers/isama/color/opt3.htm historical details].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5157">In [[mathematics]], an '''open book decomposition''' (or simply an '''open book''') is a [[manifold decomposition|decomposition]] of a [[closed manifold|closed]] [[oriented]] [[3-manifold]] ''M'' into a union of [[Surface (topology)|surface]]s (necessarily with boundary) and [[solid torus|solid tori]]. Open books have relevance to [[contact geometry]], with a famous theorem of [[Emmanuel Giroux]] (given below) that shows that contact geometry can be studied from an entirely topological viewpoint.

==Definition and construction==
'''Definition.'''  An ''open book decomposition'' of a 3-dimensional manifold ''M'' is a pair (''B'', π) where
:*''B'' is an oriented [[link (knot theory)|link]] in ''M'', called the '''binding''' of the open book;
:*&amp;pi;: ''M''&amp;nbsp;\&amp;nbsp;''B''&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp;''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; is a [[fibration]] of the [[complement (set theory)|complement]] of ''B'' such that for each &amp;theta;&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin;&amp;nbsp;''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, &amp;pi;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;(&amp;theta;) is the interior of a compact surface &amp;Sigma;&amp;nbsp;⊂&amp;nbsp;''M'' whose boundary is ''B''. The surface &amp;Sigma; is called the '''page''' of the open book.
This is the special case ''m'' = 3 of an open book decomposition of an ''m''-dimensional manifold, for any ''m''.

When Σ is an oriented compact surface with ''n'' boundary components and φ:&amp;nbsp;Σ&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;Σ is a [[homeomorphism]] which is the identity near the boundary, we can construct an open book by first forming the [[mapping torus]] Σ&lt;sub&gt;φ&lt;/sub&gt;. Since φ is the identity on ∂Σ, ∂Σ&lt;sub&gt;φ&lt;/sub&gt; is the trivial circle bundle over a union of circles, that is, a union of tori; one torus for each boundary component. To complete the construction, [[solid torus|solid tori]] are glued to fill in the boundary tori so that each circle ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;{''p''}&amp;nbsp;⊂&amp;nbsp;''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;times;∂''D''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is identified with the boundary of a page. In this case, the binding is the collection of ''n'' cores ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;times;{q} of the ''n'' solid tori glued into the mapping torus, for arbitrarily chosen ''q''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''D''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. It is known that any open book can be constructed this way. As the only information used in the construction is the surface and the homeomorphism, an alternate definition of open book is simply the pair (Σ,&amp;nbsp;φ) with the construction understood. In short, an open book is a mapping torus with solid tori glued in so that the core circle of each torus runs parallel to the boundary of the fiber.

Each torus in ∂Σ&lt;sub&gt;φ&lt;/sub&gt; is fibered by circles parallel to the binding, each circle a boundary component of a page. One envisions a [[rolodex]]-looking structure for a neighborhood of the binding (that is, the solid torus glued to ∂Σ&lt;sub&gt;φ&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;mdash;the pages of the rolodex connect to pages of the open book and the center of the rolodex is the binding. Thus the term ''open book''.

It is a 1972 theorem of Elmar Winkelnkemper that for ''m''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;6, a simply-connected ''m''-dimensional manifold has an open book decomposition if and only if it has signature&amp;nbsp;0. In 1977 Terry Lawson proved that for odd ''m''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;6, every ''m''-dimensional manifold has an open book decomposition. For even ''m''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;6,  an ''m''-dimensional manifold has an open book decomposition if and only if an asymmetric [[Witt group]] obstruction is 0, by a 1979 theorem of [[Frank Quinn (mathematician)|Frank Quinn]].

==Giroux correspondence==

In 2002, Emmanuel Giroux published the following result:

'''Theorem.''' Let ''M'' be a compact oriented 3-manifold. Then there is a [[bijection]] between the set of oriented [[contact structure]]s on ''M'' [[up to]] [[Ambient isotopy|isotopy]] and the set of open book decompositions of ''M'' up to positive stabilization.

''Positive stabilization'' consists of modifying the page by adding a [[handle decomposition|2-dimensional 1-handle]] and modifying the monodromy by adding a positive [[Dehn twist]] along a curve that runs over that handle exactly once. Implicit in this theorem is that the new open book defines the same contact 3-manifold. Giroux's result has led to some breakthroughs in what is becoming more commonly called [[contact topology]], such as the classification of contact structures on certain classes of 3-manifolds. Roughly speaking, a contact structure corresponds to an open book if, away from the binding, the contact distribution is isotopic to the tangent spaces of the pages through [[confoliation]]s. One imagines smoothing the contact planes (preserving the contact condition almost everywhere) to lie tangent to the pages.

In [[mathematics]], especially the field of [[group theory]], the '''Parker vector''' is an integer vector that describes a [[permutation group]] in terms of the cycle structure of its elements.

==Definition==
The Parker vector ''P'' of a permutation group ''G'' acting on a set of size ''n'', is the vector whose ''k''th component for ''k'' = 1, …, ''n'' is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;P_k = \frac{k}{|G|} \sum_{g \in G} c_k(g)&lt;/math&gt; where ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(''g'') is the number of ''k''-cycles in the cycle decomposition of ''g''.

==Applications==
The Parker vector can assist in the recognition of [[Galois group]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30639">[[File:Wolfgang Pauli.jpg|thumb|right|[[Wolfgang Pauli]] (1900&amp;ndash;1958), ca. 1924. Pauli received the [[Nobel Prize in physics]] in 1945, nominated by [[Albert Einstein]], for the [[Pauli exclusion principle]].]]
In [[mathematical physics]] and [[mathematics]], the '''Pauli matrices''' are a set of three {{math|2 × 2}} [[complex number|complex]] [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] which are [[Hermitian matrix|Hermitian]] and [[Unitary matrix|unitary]].&lt;ref name=planetmath&gt;{{cite web|title=Pauli matrices|url=http://planetmath.org/PauliMatrices|publisher=Planetmath website|accessdate=28 May 2013|date=28 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Usually indicated by the [[Greek (alphabet)|Greek]] letter [[sigma]] ({{mvar|σ}}), they are occasionally denoted by [[tau]] ({{mvar|τ}}) when used in connection with [[isospin]] symmetries.  They are
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \sigma_1 = \sigma_x &amp;=
    \begin{pmatrix}
      0&amp;1\\
      1&amp;0
    \end{pmatrix} \\
  \sigma_2 = \sigma_y &amp;=
    \begin{pmatrix}
      0&amp;-i\\
      i&amp;0
    \end{pmatrix} \\
  \sigma_3 = \sigma_z &amp;=
    \begin{pmatrix}
      1&amp;0\\
      0&amp;-1
    \end{pmatrix} \,.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

These matrices are named after the physicist [[Wolfgang Pauli]]. In [[quantum mechanics]], they occur in the [[Pauli equation]] which takes into account the interaction of the [[spin (physics)|spin]] of a particle with an external [[electromagnetic field]].

Each Pauli matrix is [[Hermitian matrix|Hermitian]], and together with the identity matrix {{mvar|I}} (sometimes considered as the zeroth Pauli matrix {{math|''σ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}), the Pauli matrices (multiplied by ''real'' coefficients) form a basis for the [[vector space]] of {{math|2 × 2}} [[Hermitian matrix|Hermitian matrices]].

Hermitian operators represent [[observable]]s, so the Pauli matrices span the space of observables of the {{math|2}}-dimensional complex [[Hilbert space]].  In the context of Pauli's work, {{math|''σ''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}} represents the observable corresponding to spin along the {{mvar|k}}th  coordinate axis in three-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

The Pauli matrices (after multiplication by {{mvar|i}}  to make them [[skew-Hermitian|anti-Hermitian]]), also generate transformations in the sense of [[Lie algebra]]s: the matrices {{math|''iσ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''iσ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''iσ''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}} form a basis for &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{su}(2)&lt;/math&gt;, which [[Exponential map (Lie theory)|exponentiates]] to the '''special unitary group''' [[SU(2)#n = 2|SU(2)]].&lt;ref group=nb&gt;This conforms to the ''mathematics'' convention for the [[matrix exponential]], {{math|''iσ'' ↦ exp(''iσ'')}}. In the ''physics'' convention, {{math|''σ'' ↦ exp(−''iσ'')}}, hence in it no pre-multiplication by {{mvar|i}} is necessary to land in {{math|SU(2)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Algebra over a field|algebra]] generated by the three matrices {{math|''σ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''σ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''σ''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}} is [[isomorphic]] to the [[Clifford algebra]] of {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

== Algebraic properties ==

All three of the Pauli matrices can be compacted into a single expression:

:&lt;math&gt;
  \sigma_a = 
    \begin{pmatrix}
      \delta_{a3}                &amp;  \delta_{a1} - i\delta_{a2}\\
      \delta_{a1} + i\delta_{a2} &amp; -\delta_{a3}
    \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''i'' {{=}} {{sqrt|−1}}}} is the [[imaginary unit]], and {{math|''δ&lt;sub&gt;ab&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is the [[Kronecker delta]], which equals +1 if {{math|''a'' {{=}} ''b''}} and 0 otherwise. This expression is useful for "selecting" any one of the matrices numerically by substituting values of {{math|''a'' {{=}} 1, 2, 3}}, in turn useful when any of the matrices (but no particular one) is to be used in algebraic manipulations.

The matrices are [[Involutory matrix|involutory]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_1^2 = \sigma_2^2 = \sigma_3^2 = -i\sigma_1 \sigma_2 \sigma_3 = \begin{pmatrix} 1&amp;0\\0&amp;1\end{pmatrix} = I&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''I''}} is the [[identity matrix]].

*The [[determinant]]s and [[trace of a matrix|trace]]s of the Pauli matrices are:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
               \det \sigma_i &amp;= -1, \\
  \operatorname{Tr} \sigma_i &amp;= 0 .
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

From above we can deduce that the [[eigenvalues]] of each {{math|''σ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are {{math|±1}}.

*Together with the {{math|2 × 2}} identity matrix {{math|''I''}} (sometimes written as {{math|''σ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}), the Pauli matrices form an orthogonal basis, in the sense of [[Hilbert–Schmidt operator|Hilbert–Schmidt]], for the real [[Hilbert space]] of {{math|2 × 2}} complex Hermitian matrices, or the complex Hilbert space of all {{math|2 × 2}} matrices.

=== Eigenvectors and eigenvalues ===

Each of the ([[Hermitian]]) Pauli matrices has two [[eigenvalues]], {{math|+1}} and {{math|−1}}.  The corresponding [[Normalisable wavefunction|normalized]] [[eigenvectors]] are:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  &amp;\psi_{x+} = \frac{1}\sqrt{2} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}, &amp; &amp;\psi_{x-} = \frac{1}\sqrt{2} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}, \\
  &amp;\psi_{y+} = \frac{1}\sqrt{2} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ i \end{pmatrix}, &amp; &amp;\psi_{y-} = \frac{1}\sqrt{2} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -i \end{pmatrix}, \\
  &amp;\psi_{z+} =                  \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, &amp; &amp;\psi_{z-} =                  \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\  1 \end{pmatrix}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Pauli vector ===
The Pauli vector is defined by&lt;ref group=nb&gt;The Pauli vector is a formal device. It may be thought of as an element of {{math|''M''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(ℂ) ⊗ ℝ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}, where the [[tensor product|tensor product space]] is endowed with a mapping {{math|⋅: ℝ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; × ''M''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(ℂ) ⊗ ℝ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; → ''M''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(ℂ)}} induced by the [[dot product]] on {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{\sigma} = \sigma_1 \hat{x} + \sigma_2 \hat{y} + \sigma_3 \hat{z} &lt;/math&gt;

and provides a mapping mechanism from a vector basis to a Pauli matrix basis&lt;ref&gt;See the [[Lorentz group#Relation to the Möbius group|spinor map]].&lt;/ref&gt; as follows,
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \vec{a} \cdot \vec{\sigma} &amp;= (a_i \hat{x}_i) \cdot (\sigma_j \hat{x}_j ) \\
                             &amp;= a_i \sigma_j \hat{x}_i \cdot \hat{x}_j \\
                             &amp;= a_i \sigma_j \delta_{ij} \\
                             &amp;= a_i \sigma_i =\begin{pmatrix} a_3&amp;a_1-ia_2\\a_1+ia_2&amp;-a_3\end{pmatrix} 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

using the [[Einstein notation|summation convention]].  Further,
:&lt;math&gt;\det \vec{a} \cdot \vec{\sigma} = -\vec{a} \cdot \vec{a} = -|\vec{a}|^2,&lt;/math&gt;
its eigenvalues being &lt;math&gt;\pm |\vec{a}| &lt;/math&gt;,  and moreover (see completeness, below) 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{tr} [(\vec{a} \cdot \vec{\sigma}) \vec{\sigma}] = \vec{a}~.&lt;/math&gt;

Its (unnormalized) eigenvectors are 
&lt;math&gt;\psi_+ =                  \begin{pmatrix} a_3+|\vec{a}| \\ a_1+ia_2  \end{pmatrix}; \qquad  \psi_- =   \begin{pmatrix} ia_2-a_1 \\  a_3+|\vec{a}| \end{pmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Commutation relations ===
The Pauli matrices obey the following [[commutator|commutation]] relations:
:&lt;math&gt;[\sigma_a, \sigma_b] = 2 i \varepsilon_{a b c}\,\sigma_c \, , &lt;/math&gt;

and [[anticommutator|anticommutation]] relations:
:&lt;math&gt;\{\sigma_a, \sigma_b\} = 2 \delta_{a b}\,I.&lt;/math&gt;

where the [[structure constant]] {{math|''ε&lt;sub&gt;abc&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is the [[Levi-Civita symbol]], Einstein summation notation is used, {{math|''δ&lt;sub&gt;ab&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is the [[Kronecker delta]], and {{math|''I''}} is the {{math|2 × 2}} identity matrix.

For example,
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
    \left[\sigma_1, \sigma_2\right] &amp;= 2i\sigma_3 \, \\
    \left[\sigma_2, \sigma_3\right] &amp;= 2i\sigma_1 \, \\
    \left[\sigma_3, \sigma_1\right] &amp;= 2i\sigma_2 \, \\
    \left[\sigma_1, \sigma_1\right] &amp;= 0\, \\
  \left\{\sigma_1, \sigma_1\right\} &amp;= 2I\, \\
  \left\{\sigma_1, \sigma_2\right\} &amp;= 0\,.\\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

===Relation to dot and cross product===
Pauli vectors elegantly map these commutation and anticommutation relations to corresponding vector products.  Adding the commutator to the anticommutator gives
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align} 
  \left[\sigma_a, \sigma_b\right] + \{\sigma_a, \sigma_b\}  &amp;= (\sigma_a \sigma_b - \sigma_b \sigma_a ) + (\sigma_a \sigma_b + \sigma_b \sigma_a) \\
    2i\varepsilon_{a b c}\,\sigma_c + 2 \delta_{a b}I &amp;= 2\sigma_a \sigma_b 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
so that,  
{{Equation box 1
 |indent =:
 |equation =  &lt;math&gt; \sigma_a \sigma_b = \delta_{a b}I + i\varepsilon_{a b c}\,\sigma_c~ .&lt;/math&gt;

 |border colour = #0073CF

}}

[[tensor contraction|Contracting]] each side of the equation with components of two {{math|3}}-vectors {{math|''a&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and {{math|''b&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;''}} (which commute with the Pauli matrices, i.e., {{math|''a&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;σ&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ''σ&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'')}} for each matrix {{math|''σ&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and vector component {{math|''a&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''}} (and likewise with {{math|''b&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;''}}), and relabeling indices {{math|''a'', ''b'', ''c'' → ''p'', ''q'', ''r''}}, to prevent notational conflicts, yields
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align} 
  a_p b_q \sigma_p \sigma_q &amp; = a_p b_q \left(i\varepsilon_{pqr}\,\sigma_r + \delta_{pq}I\right) \\
  a_p \sigma_p b_q \sigma_q &amp; = i\varepsilon_{pqr}\,a_p b_q \sigma_r + a_p b_q \delta_{pq}I  ~.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Finally, translating the index notation for the [[dot product]] and [[cross product#Index notation for tensors|cross product]] results in 
{{NumBlk||{{Equation box 1
  |indent =:
  |equation = &lt;math&gt;(\vec{a} \cdot \vec{\sigma})(\vec{b} \cdot \vec{\sigma}) = (\vec{a} \cdot \vec{b}) \, I + i ( \vec{a} \times \vec{b} )\cdot \vec{\sigma}&lt;/math&gt;
  |cellpadding= 6
  |border
  |border colour = #0073CF
  |bgcolor=#F9FFF7
 }}
 |{{EquationRef|1}}
}}

If &lt;math&gt; i &lt;/math&gt; is identified with the pseudoscalar &lt;math&gt; \sigma_x \sigma_y \sigma_z &lt;/math&gt; then the right hand side becomes &lt;math&gt; a \cdot b + a \wedge b &lt;/math&gt; which is also the definition for the product of two vectors in  geometric algebra.

===Some trace relations===

Following traces can be derived using the commutation and anticommutation relations.

:&lt;math&gt;tr(\sigma_a)=0&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;tr(\sigma_a \sigma_b)=2\delta_{ab}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;tr(\sigma_a \sigma_b \sigma_c)=2i\varepsilon_{abc}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; tr(\sigma_a \sigma_b \sigma_c \sigma_d)=2(\delta_{ab}\delta_{cd}-\delta_{ac}\delta_{bd}+\delta_{ad}\delta_{bc}) &lt;/math&gt;

===Exponential of a Pauli vector===
For 
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{a} = a\hat{n},  \quad |\hat{n}| = 1,&lt;/math&gt;
one has, for even powers, &lt;math&gt;2p, \ \ p = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(\hat{n} \cdot \vec{\sigma})^{2p} = I &lt;/math&gt;
which can be shown first for the &lt;math&gt;p = 1&lt;/math&gt; case using the anticommutation relations. For convenience, the case &lt;math&gt;p = 0&lt;/math&gt; is taken to be &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; by convention.

For odd powers, &lt;math&gt;2q+1, \ \ q = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(\hat{n} \cdot \vec{\sigma})^{2q+1} = \hat{n} \cdot \vec{\sigma} \, .&lt;/math&gt;

[[Matrix exponential|Matrix exponentiating]], and using the [[Taylor series#List of Maclaurin series of some common functions|Taylor series for sine and cosine]],
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  e^{i a(\hat{n} \cdot \vec{\sigma})} &amp;= \sum_{k=0}^\infty{\frac{i^k \left[a (\hat{n} \cdot \vec{\sigma})\right]^k}{k!}} \\
                                      &amp;= \sum_{p=0}^\infty{\frac{(-1)^p (a\hat{n}\cdot \vec{\sigma})^{2p}}{(2p)!}} + i\sum_{q=0}^\infty{\frac{(-1)^q (a\hat{n}\cdot \vec{\sigma})^{2q + 1}}{(2q + 1)!}} \\
                                      &amp;= I\sum_{p=0}^\infty{\frac{(-1)^p a^{2p}}{(2p)!}} + i (\hat{n}\cdot \vec{\sigma}) \sum_{q=0}^\infty{\frac{(-1)^q a^{2q+1}}{(2q + 1)!}}\\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;.

In the last line, the first sum is the cosine, while the second sum is the sine; so, finally,
{{NumBlk||{{Equation box 1

which is [[Quaternions and spatial rotation#Using quaternion rotations|analogous]] to [[Euler's formula]], extended to [[quaternions]].

Note that
:&lt;math&gt;\det[i a(\hat{n} \cdot \vec{\sigma})] = a^2&lt;/math&gt;,
while the determinant of the exponential itself is just {{math|1}}, which makes it the '''generic group element of [[SU(2)]]'''.

A more abstract version of formula {{EquationNote|(2)}} for a general {{math|2 × 2}} matrix can be found in the article on [[Matrix exponential#via Laurent series|matrix exponentials]]. A general version of {{EquationNote|(2)}} for an analytic (at ''a'' and &amp;minus;''a'') function  is provided by application of  [[Sylvester's formula]],&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;f(a(\hat{n} \cdot \vec{\sigma})) = I\frac{f(a)+f(-a)}{2} +  \hat{n} \cdot \vec{\sigma} \frac{f(a)-f(-a)}{2} ~.&lt;/math&gt; 
 
====The group composition law of {{math|SU(2)}}====
A straightforward application of  formula {{EquationNote|(2)}}  provides a parameterization of the composition law of  the group {{math|SU(2)}}.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;N.B.  The relation among {{math|''a, b, c,'' ''' n, m, k '''}} derived here in the {{math|2 × 2}} representation holds for ''all representations'' of {{math|SU(2)}}, being a ''group identity''. Note that, by virtue of the standard normalization of that group's generators as ''half'' the Pauli matrices, the parameters ''a,b,c'' correspond to ''half'' the rotation angles of the rotation group. &lt;/ref&gt; One may directly solve for {{mvar|c}} in 
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  e^{i a(\hat{n} \cdot \vec{\sigma})} e^{i b(\hat{m} \cdot \vec{\sigma})}
    &amp;= I(\cos a \cos b - \hat{n} \cdot\hat{m} \sin a \sin b) + i(\hat{n} \sin a \cos b + \hat{m}  \sin b \cos a - \hat{n}\times\hat{m} ~ \sin a \sin b  )\cdot  \vec{\sigma } \\
    &amp;= I\cos{c} + i (\hat{k} \cdot \vec{\sigma}) \sin{c} \\
    &amp;= e^{i c \left(\hat{k} \cdot \vec{\sigma}\right)},
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

which specifies the generic group multiplication, where, manifestly,  
:&lt;math&gt;\cos c = \cos a \cos b - \hat{n} \cdot\hat{m} \sin a \sin b~,&lt;/math&gt;

the [[spherical law of cosines]].  Given {{mvar|c}}, then, 
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{k} = \frac{1}{\sin c}\left(\hat{n} \sin a \cos b + \hat{m} \sin b \cos a - \hat{n}\times\hat{m}  \sin a \sin b\right) ~.&lt;/math&gt;

Consequently, the composite rotation parameters in this group element (a closed form of the respective [[Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula|BCH expansion]] in this case) simply amount to&lt;ref&gt;cf.  J W Gibbs (1884). ''Elements of Vector Analysis'', New Haven, 1884, p. 67. In fact, however, the formula goes back to [[Olinde Rodrigues]], 1840, replete with half-angle:  "Des lois géometriques qui regissent les déplacements d' un systéme solide dans l' espace, et de la variation des coordonnées provenant de ces déplacement considérées indépendant des causes qui peuvent les produire", ''J. Math. Pures Appl.'' '''5''' (1840), 380–440; &lt;/ref&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;e^{ic \hat{k}\cdot \vec{\sigma}}= \exp \left( i\frac{c}{\sin c}   (\hat{n} \sin a \cos b + \hat{m}  \sin b \cos a - \hat{n}\times\hat{m}  ~ \sin a \sin b  )\cdot \vec{\sigma}\right ) ~.&lt;/math&gt; 
(Of course, when {{mvar|n&amp;#770;}} is parallel to {{mvar|m&amp;#770;}}, so is {{mvar|k&amp;#770;}}, and  {{math|''c'' {{=}} ''a + b''}}.)
{{see also|Rotation formalisms in three dimensions#Rodrigues parameters and Gibbs representation|Spinor#Three dimensions}}

====Adjoint action====
It is also straightforward to likewise work out the adjoint action on the Pauli vector, namely rotation effectively by double the angle {{mvar|a}},
:&lt;math&gt;  
e^{i a(\hat{n} \cdot \vec{\sigma})} ~ \vec{\sigma}~  e^{-i a(\hat{n} \cdot \vec{\sigma})}=   \vec{\sigma}  \cos (2a)+     \hat{n} \times \vec{\sigma}      ~\sin (2a)+ \hat{n} ~ \hat{n} \cdot \vec{\sigma} ~  (1-\cos (2a))~
 .&lt;/math&gt;

{{see also|Rodrigues' rotation formula}}

=== Completeness relation ===
An alternative notation that is commonly used for the Pauli matrices is to write the vector index {{mvar|i}} in the superscript, and the matrix indices as subscripts, so that the element in row {{mvar|α}} and column {{mvar|β}} of the {{mvar|i}}-th Pauli matrix is {{math|''σ'' &lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''αβ''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

In this notation, the '''completeness relation''' for the Pauli matrices can be written
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{\sigma}_{\alpha\beta}\cdot\vec{\sigma}_{\gamma\delta}\equiv \sum_{i=1}^3 \sigma^i_{\alpha\beta}\sigma^i_{\gamma\delta} = 2 \delta_{\alpha\delta} \delta_{\beta\gamma} - \delta_{\alpha\beta}\delta_{\gamma\delta}.&lt;/math&gt;
  
::'''Proof''':  The fact that the Pauli matrices, along with the identity matrix ''I'', form an orthogonal basis for the complex Hilbert space of all 2 &amp;times; 2 matrices means that we can express any matrix ''M'' as
::&lt;math&gt;M = c I + \sum_i a_i \sigma^i&lt;/math&gt;
::where ''c'' is a complex number, and ''a'' is a 3-component complex vector.  It is straightforward to show, using the properties listed above, that
::&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{tr}\, \sigma^i\sigma^j = 2\delta_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;
::where "tr" denotes the [[Trace (linear algebra)|trace]], and hence that 
::&lt;math&gt;c=\frac{1}{2}\mathrm{tr}\,M&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a_i = \frac{1}{2}\mathrm{tr}\,\sigma^i M ~.&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\therefore ~~ 2M = I \mathrm{tr}\, M + \sum_i \sigma^i \mathrm{tr}\, \sigma^i M ~,&lt;/math&gt;
::which can be rewritten in terms of matrix indices as
::&lt;math&gt;2M_{\alpha\beta} = \delta_{\alpha\beta} M_{\gamma\gamma} + \sum_i \sigma^i_{\alpha\beta} \sigma^i_{\gamma\delta} M_{\delta\gamma}~,&lt;/math&gt;
::where [[Einstein notation|summation is implied]] over the repeated indices ''γ'' and ''δ''.  Since this is true for any choice of the matrix ''M'', the completeness relation follows as stated above.
 
As noted above, it is common to denote the 2 &amp;times; 2 unit matrix by ''σ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, so ''σ''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''αβ''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''δ''&lt;sub&gt;''αβ''&lt;/sub&gt;.  
The completeness relation can alternatively be expressed as
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=0}^3 \sigma^i_{\alpha\beta}\sigma^i_{\gamma\delta} = 2 \delta_{\alpha\delta} \delta_{\beta\gamma}~.&lt;/math&gt;

The fact that any {{math|2 × 2}} complex Hermitian matrices can be expressed in terms of the identity matrix and the Pauli matrices also leads to the [[Bloch sphere]] representation of {{math|2 × 2}} [[mixed state (physics)|mixed state]]s' density matrix, ({{math|2 × 2}} positive semidefinite matrices with trace {{math|1}}).  This can be seen by simply first writing an arbitrary  Hermitian matrix as a real linear combination of {{math|{&lt;nowiki/&gt;''σ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''σ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''σ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''σ''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;nowiki/&gt;}} as above, and then imposing the positive-semidefinite and [[Trace (linear algebra)|trace]] {{math|1}} conditions.

=== Relation with the permutation operator ===
Let {{math|''P&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;''}} be the [[transposition (mathematics)|transposition]] (also known as a permutation) between two spins {{math|''σ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''σ''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;}} living in the [[tensor product]] space {{math|ℂ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;otimes; ℂ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}},
:&lt;math&gt;P_{ij}|\sigma_i \sigma_j\rangle =  |\sigma_j \sigma_i\rangle \,.&lt;/math&gt;

This operator can also be written more explicitly as [[Exchange interaction#Inclusion of spin|Dirac's spin exchange operator]],
:&lt;math&gt;P_{ij} = \tfrac{1}{2}(\vec{\sigma}_i\cdot\vec{\sigma}_j + 1)\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Its eigenvalues are therefore&lt;ref&gt;Explicitly, in the convention of "right-space matrices into elements of left-space matrices", it is  &lt;math&gt;\quad\left (\begin{smallmatrix}
      1&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\\
          0&amp;0&amp;1&amp;0\\  
             0&amp;1&amp;0&amp;0\\  
                0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;1\end{smallmatrix}\right )~.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 1 or −1. It may thus be utilized as an interaction term in a Hamiltonian, splitting the energy eigenvalues of its symmetric versus antisymmetric eigenstates.

== SU(2) ==

The group [[SU(2)]] is the [[Lie group]] of [[unitary matrix|unitary]]  2×2 matrices with unit determinant; its [[Lie algebra]] is the set of all 2×2 anti-Hermitian matrices  with trace 0.  Direct calculation, as above,  shows that the [[Lie algebra]] &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{su}_2&lt;/math&gt; is the 3-dimensional real algebra [[Linear span|spanned]] by the set {{math|{''iσ&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''}}}. In compact notation,
:&lt;math&gt; \mathfrak{su}(2) = \operatorname{span} \{ i \sigma_1, i \sigma_2 , i \sigma_3 \}.&lt;/math&gt;

As a result, each {{math|''iσ&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''}} can be seen as an [[Lie group#The Lie algebra associated with a Lie group|infinitesimal generator]] of SU(2). The elements of SU(2) are exponentials of linear combinations of these three generators, and multiply as indicated above in discussing the Pauli vector. Although this suffices to generate SU(2), it is not a proper [[Representation theory of SU(2)|representation of {{math|su(2)}}]], as the Pauli eigenvalues are scaled unconventionally. The conventional normalization is {{math|1=''λ'' =}}&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|1|2}}, so that
:&lt;math&gt; \mathfrak{su}(2) = \operatorname{span} \left\{\frac{i \sigma_1}{2}, \frac{i \sigma_2}{2}, \frac{i \sigma_3}{2} \right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

As SU(2) is a compact group, its [[Cartan decomposition]] is trivial.

=== SO(3) ===
The Lie algebra {{math|'''su'''(2)}} is [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the Lie algebra {{math|'''so'''(3)}}, which corresponds to the Lie group [[Rotation group SO(3)|SO(3)]], the [[group (mathematics)|group]] of [[rotation]]s in three-dimensional space.  In other words, one can say that the {{math|''iσ&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''}} are a realization (and, in fact, the lowest-dimensional realization) of ''infinitesimal'' rotations in three-dimensional space.  However, even though {{math|'''su'''(2)}} and {{math|'''so'''(3)}} are isomorphic as Lie algebras, {{math|SU(2)}} and {{math|SO(3)}} are not isomorphic as Lie groups.  {{math|SU(2)}} is actually a [[Double covering group|double cover]] of {{math|SO(3)}}, meaning that there is a two-to-one group homomorphism from {{math|SU(2)}} to {{math|SO(3)}}, see [[Rotation group SO(3)#Relationship between SO(3) and SU(2)|relationship between SO(3) and SU(2)]].

=== Quaternions ===
The real linear span of {{math|{&lt;nowiki/&gt;''I'', ''iσ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''iσ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''iσ''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;nowiki/&gt;}} is isomorphic to the real algebra of [[quaternions]] {{math|ℍ}}.  The isomorphism from {{math|ℍ}} to this set is given by the following map (notice the reversed signs for the Pauli matrices):
:&lt;math&gt;
  1 \mapsto I, \quad
  i \mapsto - i \sigma_1, \quad
  j \mapsto - i \sigma_2, \quad
  k \mapsto - i \sigma_3.
&lt;/math&gt;

Alternatively, the isomorphism can be achieved by a map using the Pauli matrices in reversed order,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| first=Mikio |last=Nakahara | title=Geometry, topology, and physics | edition=2nd | publisher=CRC Press | isbn=978-0-7503-0606-5 | year=2003|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}} }}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=cH-XQB0Ex5wC&amp;pg=PR22 pp. xxii].&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
  1 \mapsto I, \quad
  i \mapsto i \sigma_3, \quad
  j \mapsto i \sigma_2, \quad
  k \mapsto i \sigma_1.
&lt;/math&gt;

As the set of [[versor]]s ''U'' ⊂ ℍ forms a group isomorphic to {{math|SU(2)}}, ''U'' gives yet another way of describing {{math|SU(2)}}.  The two-to-one homomorphism from {{math|SU(2)}} to {{math|SO(3)}} may be given in terms of the Pauli matrices in this formulation.

Quaternions form a [[division algebra]]—every non-zero element has an inverse—whereas Pauli matrices do not. As Pauli matrices lie in M(2,ℂ), isomorphic to the algebra of [[biquaternion]]s, linear spaces of eight real dimensions, they go beyond the four-dimensional quaternions. 

Multiplying any two Pauli matrices always yield the matrix of a versor.

== Physics ==

=== Classical mechanics ===
In [[classical mechanics]], Pauli matrices are useful in the context of the Cayley-Klein parameters.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Classical Mechanics|last=Goldstein|first=Herbert|publisher=Addison-Wesley|year=1959|isbn=|location=|pages=109–118}}&lt;/ref&gt; The matrix ''P'' corresponding to the position &lt;math&gt;\vec{x}&lt;/math&gt; of a point in space is defined in terms of the above Pauli vector matrix,  
:&lt;math&gt;P=\vec{x} \cdot \vec{\sigma} =x\sigma_x+y\sigma_y+z\sigma_z ~.&lt;/math&gt;

Consequently, the transformation matrix &lt;math&gt;Q_\theta&lt;/math&gt; for rotations about the ''x''-axis through an angle ''θ''   may be written in terms of Pauli matrices and the unit matrix as &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Q_\theta=1\!\!1  \cos\tfrac{\theta}{2}+i\sigma_x \sin\tfrac{\theta}{2} ~.&lt;/math&gt;
Similar expressions follow for general Pauli vector rotations as detailed above.

=== Quantum mechanics ===

In [[quantum mechanics]], each Pauli matrix is related to an [[angular momentum operator]] that corresponds to an [[observable]] describing the [[spin (physics)|spin]] of a [[spin-½|spin ½]] particle, in each of the three spatial directions.  As an immediate consequence of the Cartan decomposition mentioned above, {{math|''iσ&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''}} are the generators of a [[projective representation]] ('''spin representation''') of the [[rotation group SO(3)]] acting on [[theory of relativity|non-relativistic]] particles with spin ½.  The [[mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics|states]] of the particles are represented as two-component [[Spinors in three dimensions|spinors]]. In the same way, the Pauli matrices are related to the [[Isospin|isospin operator]].

An interesting property of spin ½ particles is that they must be rotated by an angle of 4{{mvar|π}} in order to return to their original configuration.  This is due to the two-to-one correspondence between SU(2) and SO(3) mentioned above, and the fact that, although one visualizes spin up/down as the north/south pole on the [[2-sphere]] {{mvar|S}} &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, they are actually represented by [[orthogonal]] vectors in the two dimensional complex [[Hilbert space]].

For a spin ½ particle, the spin operator is given by {{math|'''''J'''''{{=}}{{sfrac|''ħ''|2}}'''''&amp;sigma;'''''}}, the [[fundamental representation]] of [[representation theory of SU(2)|''SU(2)'']]. By taking [[Kronecker product]]s of this representation with itself repeatedly, one may construct all higher irreducible representations.  That is, the  resulting [[spin operator]]s for higher spin systems in three spatial dimensions,  for arbitrarily large ''j'',  can be calculated using this [[spin operator]] and [[Ladder operator#Angular momentum|ladder operators]]. They can be found in [[Rotation group SO(3)#A note on Lie algebra]]. The analog formula to the above generalization of Euler's formula for Pauli matrices, the group element in terms of spin matrices, is tractable, but less simple.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.3842/SIGMA.2014.084|last = Curtright|last2 = Fairlie|last3 = Zachos |first = T L |first2 = D B |first3 = C K|authorlink=Thomas Curtright|authorlink2=David Fairlie|authorlink3=Cosmas Zachos|year = 2014|title = A compact formula for rotations as spin matrix polynomials| journal =SIGMA| volume=10| page=084|arxiv = 1402.3541 |bibcode = 2014SIGMA..10..084C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also useful in the [[quantum mechanics]] of multiparticle systems, the general [[Pauli group]] {{math|''G&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is defined to consist of all {{mvar|n}}-fold [[tensor]] products of Pauli matrices.

=== Relativistic quantum mechanics ===
In [[relativistic quantum mechanics]], the spinors in four dimensions are 4 &amp;times; 1 (or 1 &amp;times; 4) matrices. Hence the Pauli matrices or the Sigma matrices operating on these spinors have to be 4 &amp;times; 4 matrices. They are defined in terms of 2 &amp;times; 2 Pauli matrices as
:&lt;math&gt;\mathsf{\Sigma}_i=\begin{pmatrix} \mathsf{\sigma}_i &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; \mathsf{\sigma}_i \end{pmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;
It follows from this definition that &lt;math&gt;\mathsf{\Sigma}_i&lt;/math&gt; matrices have the same algebraic properties as &lt;math&gt;\mathsf{\sigma}_i&lt;/math&gt; matrices.

However, [[relativistic angular momentum]] is not a three-vector, but a second order [[four-tensor]]. Hence &lt;math&gt;\mathsf{\Sigma}_i&lt;/math&gt; needs to be replaced by &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt;, the generator of [[Representation theory of the Lorentz group#The (1/2, 0) ⊕ (0, 1/2) spin representation|Lorentz transformations on spinors]]. By the antisymmetry of angular momentum, the &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt; are also antisymmetric. Hence there are only six independent matrices.

The first three are the &lt;math&gt; \mathsf{\Sigma}_{jk}\equiv \epsilon_{ijk}\mathsf{\Sigma}_i  .&lt;/math&gt; The remaining three, &lt;math&gt;\mathsf{\Sigma}_{0i}\equiv\mathsf{\alpha}_i&lt;/math&gt;, are the [[Dirac equation|Dirac &lt;math&gt;\mathsf{\alpha}_i&lt;/math&gt; matrices]] defined as
:&lt;math&gt;\mathsf{\alpha}_i=\begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; \mathsf{\sigma}_i\\ \mathsf{\sigma}_i &amp; 0\end{pmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

The relativistic spin matrices &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt; are written in  compact form in terms of commutator of [[gamma matrices]] as
:&lt;math&gt;\Sigma_{\mu\nu}=\tfrac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu,\gamma_\nu]&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Quantum information ===
*In [[quantum information]], single-[[qubit]] [[quantum gate]]s are ''2'' &amp;times; ''2'' unitary matrices.  The Pauli matrices are some of the most important single-qubit operations.  In that context, the Cartan decomposition given above is called the ''Z–Y decomposition of a single-qubit gate''.  Choosing a different Cartan pair gives a similar ''X–Y decomposition of a single-qubit gate''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2563">In [[signal processing]], any [[periodic function]]&lt;math&gt;, s_P(t)&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; with period '''P''', can be represented by a summation of an infinite number of instances of an aperiodic function&lt;math&gt;, s(t),&lt;/math&gt; that are offset by integer multiples of '''P'''.&amp;nbsp; This representation is called '''periodic summation:''' 

:&lt;math&gt;s_P(t) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty s(t + nP) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty s(t - nP).&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Fourier transform, Fourier series, DTFT, DFT.gif|thumb|400px|A Fourier transform and 3 variations caused by periodic sampling (at interval T) and/or periodic summation (at interval P) of the underlying time-domain function.]]
When &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;s_P(t)&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; is alternatively represented as a complex [[Fourier series]], the Fourier coefficients are proportional to the values (or "samples") of the [[continuous Fourier transform]], &lt;math&gt;S(f) \ \triangleq \ \mathcal{F}\{s(t)\},&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; at intervals of '''1/P'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pinsky|first=Mark|title=Introduction to Fourier Analysis and Wavelets|year=2001|publisher=Brooks/Cole|isbn=978-0534376604}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zygmund|first=Antoni|title=Trigonometric series (2nd ed.)|year=1988|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521358859}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp; That identity is a form of the [[Poisson summation formula]].  Similarly, a Fourier series whose coefficients are samples of &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;s(t)&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; at constant intervals ('''T''') is equivalent to a '''periodic summation''' of &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;S(f),&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; which is known as a [[discrete-time Fourier transform]].

The periodic summation of a [[Dirac delta function]] is the [[Dirac comb]].  Likewise, the periodic summation of an integrable function is its [[convolution]] with the Dirac comb.

== Quotient space as domain ==

If a periodic function is represented using the [[Quotient space (linear algebra)|quotient space]] [[Domain of a function|domain]]
&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}/(P\mathbb{Z})&lt;/math&gt; then one can write

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi_P : \mathbb{R}/(P\mathbb{Z}) \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi_P(x) = \sum_{\tau\in x} s(\tau)&lt;/math&gt;

instead.  The arguments of &lt;math&gt;\varphi_P&lt;/math&gt; are [[equivalence class]]es of [[real number]]s that share the same [[fractional part]] when divided by &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Polylogism''' is the belief that different groups of people reason in fundamentally different ways (coined from Greek poly=many + logos=[[logic]]).&lt;ref name="Mises glossary"&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://mises.org/easier/P.asp |chapter=Glossary, Panphysicalism - Pump-priming |title=Mises Made Easier |year=1974 |author=Percy L. Greaves Jr. |accessdate=2011-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is attributed to [[Ludwig von Mises]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Perrin, Pierre | year=2005 | title=Hermeneutic economics: Between relativism and progressive polylogism | journal=Quarterly Journal of Austrian Economics | volume=8 | number=3 | pages=21–38 | doi= 10.1007/s12113-005-1032-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; who claimed that it described [[Marxism]] and other [[social philosophy|social philosophies]].&lt;ref name="HA 3.1"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://mises.org/books/humanaction.pdf |title=Human Action |chapter=Chapter 3, Section 1 |chapterurl=http://mises.org/humanaction/chap3sec1.asp |author=Ludwig von Mises |edition=1996 |pages=72–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Misesian sense of the term, a polylogist ascribes different forms of "logic" to different groups, which may include groups based on [[race (classification of human beings)|race]],&lt;ref name="Mises glossary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Moseley 2002"&gt;{{cite book |title=A Philosophy of War |author=Alexander Moseley |page=239 |isbn=978-1-892941-94-7 |publisher=Algora Publishing |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[gender]], [[social class|class]], or [[time period]].

==Types of polylogism==

A polylogist would claim that different groups reason in fundamentally different ways: they use different "logics" for deductive inference. Normative polylogism is the claim that these different logics are equally valid. Descriptive polylogism is an empirical claim about different groups, but a descriptive polylogism need not claim equal validity for different "logics".&lt;ref name="Long 2004"&gt;{{cite news |author=Roderick Long|title=Anti-Psychologism in Economics: Wittgenstein and Mises|url=http://praxeology.net/antipsych.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is, a descriptive polylogist may insist on a universally valid deductive logic while claiming as an empirical matter that some groups use other (incorrect) reasoning strategies.

An adherent of polylogism in the Misesian sense would be a normative polylogist.  A normative polylogist might approach an argument by demonstrating how it was correct within a particular logical construct, even if it were incorrect within the logic of the analyst. As Mises noted "this never has been and never can be attempted by anybody."

===Proletarian logic===
{{Original research section|date=June 2018}}
The term 'proletarian logic' is sometimes taken as evidence of polylogism.{{Citation needed|reason=Previously a different wiki was used as a citation|date=June 2018}} This term is usually traced back to [[Joseph Dietzgen]] in his 11th letter on logic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Emmett, Dorothy | year=1928 |title=Joseph Dietzgen: The Philosopher of Proletarian Logic | journal=Journal of Adult Education | volume=3 | pages=26–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Positive Outcome of Philosophy; Letters on Logic, Especially Democratic Proletarian Logic.&lt;/ref&gt; Dietzgen is the now obscure philosophical monist of the 19th century who coined the term 'dialectical materialism' and was praised by communist figures such as [[Karl Marx]] and [[Vladimir Lenin|V. I. Lenin]].&lt;ref&gt;A Dictionary of Marxist thought&lt;/ref&gt;  His work has received modern attention primarily from the philosopher [[Bertell Ollman]].  As a monist, Dietzgen insists on a unified treatment of mind and matter. As [[Simon Boxley]] puts it, for Dietzgen "thought is as material an event as any other". This means that logic too has "material" underpinnings.{{explain|date=June 2018}} (But note that Dietzgen's "materialism" was explicitly not a [[physicalism]].)

===Racialist polylogism===
Racialist  polylogism is often identified with  the [[Nazi era]]. {{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} It has been proposed that the ferment around Einstein's theory of relativity is an example of racialist polylogism.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} Some of the criticisms of relativity theory were mixed with [[Criticism of relativity theory#Chauvinism and antisemitism|racialist resistance]] that characterized the physics as an embodiment of Jewish ideology. (For example, Nobel Prize winner [[Philipp Lenard]] claimed scientific thought was conditioned by "blood and race", and he accused Werner [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]] of teaching "[[Jewish physics]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=A history of Nazi Germany: 1919-1945 | author=Joseph W. Bendersky | year=2000 | page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;) However this appears to be an argument [[ad hominem]], not polylogism. Modern examples of supposed racialist polylogism are generally misleading. For example, US Supreme Court [[Sonia Sotomayor|Justice Sotomayor]] has been accused of racialist polylogism for suggesting  that a "wise Latina" might come to different legal conclusions than a white male. Although generally given the interpretation that life experience can influence one's ability to understand the practical implications of a legal argument, some commentators suggested that Sotomayor supported the idea that Latinas have a unique "logic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Rich Lowry |title=How Sotomayor Misspoke|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/227625/how-sotomayor-misspoke/rich-lowry}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Peter Wehner|title=Judge Sotomayor, in Her Own Words|url=http://www.commentarymagazine.com/article/judge-sotomayor-in-her-own-words/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[geometry]] of [[tessellation]]s, a '''rep-tile''' or '''reptile''' is a shape that can be [[dissection (geometry)|dissected]] into smaller copies of the same shape. The term was coined as a [[pun]] on animal [[Reptilia|reptiles]] by the [[United States of America|American]] [[mathematician]] [[Solomon W. Golomb]], who used it to describe self-replicating tilings.{{sfnp|Gardner|2001}} In 2012 a generalization of rep-tiles called [[self-tiling tile set]]s was introduced by [[Lee Sallows]] in ''[[Mathematics Magazine]]''.{{sfnp|Sallows|2012}}

[[File:A selection of rep-tiles.gif|thumb|400px|right|A selection of rep-tiles, including the [[sphinx tiling|sphinx]], two fish and the 5-triangle]]

==Terminology==

A rep-tile is labelled rep-''n'' if the dissection uses ''n'' copies. Such a shape necessarily forms the [[prototile]] for a tiling of the plane, in many cases an [[aperiodic tiling]]. 
A rep-tile dissection using different sizes of the original shape is called an irregular rep-tile or irreptile. If the dissection uses ''n'' copies, the shape is said to be irrep-''n''. If all these sub-tiles are of different sizes then the tiling is additionally described as perfect. A shape that is rep-''n'' or irrep-''n'' is trivially also irrep-(''kn''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''n'') for any ''k''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1, by replacing the smallest tile in the rep-''n'' dissection by ''n'' even smaller tiles. The order of a shape, whether using rep-tiles or irrep-tiles is the smallest possible number of tiles which will suffice.

==Examples==
[[File:pinwheel 2.gif|250px|thumb|right|Defining an aperiodic tiling (the [[pinwheel tiling]]) by repeatedly dissecting and inflating a rep-tile.]]
Every [[square]], [[rectangle]], [[parallelogram]], [[rhombus]], or [[triangle]] is rep-4. The [[sphinx tiling|sphinx]] [[polyiamond|hexiamond]] (illustrated above) is rep-4 and rep-9, and is one of few known [[#Pentagonal rep-tiles|self-replicating pentagons]]. The [[Gosper curve#Properties|Gosper island]] is rep-7. The [[Koch snowflake]] is irrep-7: six small snowflakes of the same size, together with another snowflake with three times the area of the smaller ones, can combine to form a single larger snowflake.

A [[right triangle]] with side lengths in the ratio 1:2 is rep-5, and its rep-5 dissection forms the basis of the aperiodic [[pinwheel tiling]]. By [[Pythagoras' theorem]], the [[hypotenuse]], or sloping side of the rep-5 triangle, has a length of {{radic|5}}.

The international standard [[ISO 216]] defines sizes of paper sheets using the {{math|{{sqrt|2}}}}, in which the long side of a rectangular sheet of paper is the [[square root of two]] times the short side of the paper. Rectangles in this shape are rep-2. A rectangle (or parallelogram) is rep-''n'' if its [[aspect ratio]] is {{radic|''n''}}:1. An [[isosceles triangle|isosceles]] right triangle is also rep-2.

==Rep-tiles and symmetry==

Some rep-tiles, like the [[square]] and [[equilateral triangle]], are [[symmetry|symmetrical]] and remain identical when [[mirror reflection|reflected in a mirror]]. Others, like the [[sphinx tiling|sphinx]], are [[asymmetry|asymmetrical]] and exist in [[chirality|two distinct forms]] related by mirror-reflection. Dissection of the sphinx and some other asymmetric rep-tiles requires use of both the original shape and its mirror-image.

==Rep-tiles and polyforms==

Some rep-tiles are based on [[polyform]]s like [[polyiamond]]s and [[polyomino]]es, or shapes created by laying [[equilateral triangle]]s and [[square]]s edge-to-edge.

===Squares===

If a polyomino is rectifiable, that is, able to tile a [[rectangle]], then it will also be a rep-tile, because the rectangle will then tile a [[square]]. This can be seen clearly in the [[octomino]]es, which are created from eight squares. Two copies of some octominoes will tile a square; therefore these octominoes are also rep-16 rep-tiles.

[[File:Rep-tiles constructed from rectifiable octominoes.gif|thumb|350px|none|Rep-tiles based on rectifiable [[octomino]]es]]

Four copies of some [[nonomino]]es and [[polyking|nonakings]] will tile a square, therefore these [[polyform]]s are also rep-36 rep-tiles.

[[File:Nonominoes.gif|700px|thumb|none|Rep-tiles created from rectifiable [[nonomino]]es and [[polyking|9-polykings]] (nonakings)]]

===Equilateral triangles===

Similarly, if a [[polyiamond]] tiles an equilateral triangle, it will also be a rep-tile.

[[File:Equilateral triangle reptiles.gif|thumb|700px|none|Rep-tiles created from equilateral triangles]]

[[File:Equilateral triangle rocket.gif|thumb|none|A rocket-like rep-tile created from a dodeciamond, or twelve equilateral triangles laid edge-to-edge (and corner-to-corner)]]

===Right triangles===

A [[right triangle]] is a triangle containing one right angle of 90&amp;deg;. Two particular forms of right triangle have attracted the attention of rep-tile researchers, the 45°-90°-45° triangle and the 30°-60°-90° triangle.

====45°-90°-45° triangles====

Polyforms based on [[isosceles triangle|isosceles]] [[right triangle]]s, with sides in the ratio 1&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;[[Square root of 2|{{sqrt|2}}]], are known as [[polyabolo]]s. An infinite number of them are rep-tiles. Indeed, the simplest of all rep-tiles is a single isosceles right triangle. It is rep-2 when divided by a single line bisecting the right angle to the [[hypotenuse]]. Rep-2 rep-tiles are also rep-2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; and the rep-4,8,16+ triangles yield further rep-tiles. These are found by discarding half of the sub-copies and permutating the remainder until they are [[mirror image|mirror-symmetrical]] within a right triangle. In other words, two copies will tile a right triangle. One of these new rep-tiles is reminiscent of the fish formed from three [[equilateral triangle]]s.

====30&amp;deg;-60&amp;deg;-90&amp;deg; triangles====

Polyforms based on 30&amp;deg;-60&amp;deg;-90&amp;deg; right triangles, with sides in the ratio 1&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;[[Square root of 3|{{sqrt|3}}]]&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;2, are known as [[polydrafter]]s. Some are identical to [[polymino]]es and [[polyiamond]]s, others are distinct.&lt;ref name=polydrafters&gt;[http://www.recmath.org/PolyCur/drirrep/index.html Polydrafter Irreptiling]&lt;/ref&gt;

|} 

==Multiple and variant rep-tilings==

Many of the common rep-tiles are rep-{{math|''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} for all positive integer values of&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|n}}. In particular this is true for three [[trapezoid]]s including the one formed from three equilateral triangles, for three axis-parallel hexagons (the L-tromino, L-tetromino, and P-pentomino), and the sphinx hexiamond.{{sfnp|Niţică|2003}} In addition, many rep-tiles, particularly those with higher rep-''n'', can be self-tiled in different ways. For example, the rep-9 L-tetramino has at least fourteen different rep-tilings. The rep-9 sphinx hexiamond can also be tiled in different ways.

|}

==Rep-tiles with infinite sides==

{|
|- valign=top
[[File:Horned triangle or teragonic triangle.gif|thumb|Horned triangle or teragonic triangle]]
|} 

The most familiar rep-tiles are polygons with a finite number of sides, but some shapes with an infinite number of sides can also be rep-tiles. For example, the [[teragon|teragonic]] triangle, or horned triangle, is rep-4. It is also an example of a [[#Fractals as rep-tiles|fractal rep-tile]].

==Pentagonal rep-tiles==

Triangular and quadrilateral (four-sided) rep-tiles are common, but pentagonal rep-tiles are rare. For a long time, the [[sphinx tiling|sphinx]] was widely believed to be the only example known, but the [[Germany|German]]/[[New Zealand|New-Zealand]] mathematician [http://karlscherer.com Karl Scherer] and the American mathematician [[Sicherman dice|George Sicherman]] have found more examples, including a double-pyramid and an elongated version of the sphinx. These pentagonal rep-tiles are illustrated on the [http://www2.stetson.edu/~efriedma/mathmagic/1002.html Math Magic] pages overseen by the American mathematician [[Friedman number|Erich Friedman]].&lt;ref name=pentagonal&gt;[http://www2.stetson.edu/~efriedma/mathmagic/1002.html Math Magic, Problem of the Month (October 2002)]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the sphinx and its extended versions are the only known pentagons that can be rep-tiled with equal copies.
See Clarke's [http://www.recmath.com/PolyPages/PolyPages/Reptiles.htm Reptile pages].

==Rep-tiles and fractals==

===Rep-tiles as fractals===

Rep-tiles can be used to create [[fractal]]s, or shapes that are [[self-similarity|self-similar]] at smaller and smaller scales. A rep-tile fractal is formed by subdividing the rep-tile, removing one or more copies of the subdivided shape, and then continuing [[recursion|recursively]]. For instance, the [[Sierpinski carpet]] is formed in this way from a rep-tiling of a square into 27 smaller squares, and the [[Sierpinski triangle]] is formed  from a rep-tiling of an equilateral triangle into four smaller triangles. When one sub-copy is discarded, a rep-4 L-[[triomino]] can be used to create four fractals, two of which are identical except for [[orientation (geometry)|orientation]].

|}

===Fractals as rep-tiles===

Because [[fractal]]s are self-similar on smaller and smaller scales, many are also self-tiling and are therefore rep-tiles. For example, the [[Sierpinski triangle]] is rep-3, tiled with three copies of itself, and the [[Sierpinski carpet]] is rep-8, tiled with eight copies of itself.

By construction, any fractal defined by an [[iterated function system]] of n contracting maps of the same ratio is rep-n.

==Infinite tiling==

Among regular polygons, only the triangle and square can be dissected into smaller equally sized copies of themselves. However, a regular [[hexagon]] can be dissected into six equilateral triangles, each of which can be dissected into a regular hexagon and three more equilateral triangles. This is the basis for an infinite [[tessellation|tiling]] of the hexagon with hexagons. The hexagon is therefore an [[Infinity symbol|irrep-&amp;infin;]] or irrep-infinity irreptile.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1702">In [[graph theory]], the '''replacement product''' of two graphs is a [[graph product]] that can be used to reduce the [[degree (graph theory)|degree]] of a graph while maintaining its [[connectivity (graph theory)|connectivity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hoory|first1=Shlomo|last2=Linial|first2=Nathan|last3=Wigderson|first3=Avi|title=Expander graphs and their applications|journal=Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society|date=7 August 2006|volume=43|issue=04|pages=439–562|doi=10.1090/S0273-0979-06-01126-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suppose ''G'' is a ''d''-[[regular graph]] and ''H'' is an ''e''-regular graph with vertex set {0,&amp;nbsp;&amp;hellip;,&amp;nbsp;''d''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1}. Let ''R'' denote the replacement product of ''G'' and ''H''. The vertex set of ''R'' is the [[Cartesian product]] ''V''(''G'')&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;''V''(''H''). For each vertex ''u'' in ''V''(''G'') and for each edge (''i'',&amp;nbsp;''j'') in ''E''(''H''), the vertex (''u'',&amp;nbsp;''i'') is adjacent to (''u'',&amp;nbsp;''j'') in ''R''. Furthermore, for each edge (''u'',&amp;nbsp;''v'') in ''E''(''G''), if ''v'' is the ''i''th neighbor of ''u'' and ''u'' is the ''j''th neighbor of ''v'', the vertex (''u'',&amp;nbsp;''i'') is adjacent to (''v'',&amp;nbsp;''j'') in&amp;nbsp;''R''.

If ''H'' is an ''e''-regular graph, then ''R'' is an (''e''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-regular graph.

[[File:Restricted Boltzmann machine.svg|thumb|Diagram of a restricted Boltzmann machine with three visible units and four hidden units (no bias units).]]
A '''restricted Boltzmann machine''' ('''RBM''') is a [[generative model|generative]] [[stochastic neural network|stochastic]] [[artificial neural network]] that can learn a [[probability distribution]] over its set of inputs. 

RBMs were initially invented under the name '''Harmonium''' by [[Paul Smolensky]] in 1986,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

They can be trained in either [[supervised learning|supervised]] or [[unsupervised learning|unsupervised]] ways, depending on the task.

As their name implies, RBMs are a variant of [[Boltzmann machine]]s, with the restriction that their [[Artificial neural network#Neuron|neurons]] must form a [[bipartite graph]]: 
a pair of nodes from each of the two groups of units (commonly referred to as the "visible" and "hidden" units respectively) may have a symmetric connection between them; and there are no connections between nodes within a group. By contrast, "unrestricted" Boltzmann machines may have connections between [[Artificial neural network#Hidden units|hidden units]]. This restriction allows for more efficient training algorithms than are available for the general class of Boltzmann machines, in particular the [[Gradient descent|gradient-based]] '''contrastive divergence''' algorithm.&lt;ref name="oncd"&gt;Miguel Á. Carreira-Perpiñán and Geoffrey Hinton (2005). On contrastive divergence learning. ''Artificial Intelligence and Statistics''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Restricted Boltzmann machines can also be used in [[deep learning]] networks. In particular, [[deep belief network]]s can be formed by "stacking" RBMs and optionally fine-tuning the resulting deep network with [[gradient descent]] and [[backpropagation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Structure==
The standard type of RBM has binary-valued ([[Boolean algebra|Boolean]]/[[Bernoulli distribution|Bernoulli]]) hidden and visible units, and consists of a [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] of weights &lt;math&gt;W = (w_{i,j})&lt;/math&gt; (size ''m''×''n'') associated with the connection between hidden unit &lt;math&gt;h_j&lt;/math&gt; and visible unit &lt;math&gt;v_i&lt;/math&gt;, as well as bias weights (offsets) &lt;math&gt;a_i&lt;/math&gt; for the visible units and &lt;math&gt;b_j&lt;/math&gt; for the hidden units. Given these, the ''energy'' of a configuration (pair of boolean vectors) {{math|(''v'',''h'')}} is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;E(v,h) = -\sum_i a_i v_i - \sum_j b_j h_j -\sum_i \sum_j v_i w_{i,j} h_j&lt;/math&gt;

or, in matrix notation,

:&lt;math&gt;E(v,h) = -a^{\mathrm{T}} v - b^{\mathrm{T}} h -v^{\mathrm{T}} W h&lt;/math&gt;

This energy function is analogous to that of a [[Hopfield network]]. As in general Boltzmann machines, probability distributions over hidden and/or visible vectors are defined in terms of the energy function:&lt;ref name="guide"&gt;Geoffrey Hinton (2010). ''[http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/absps/guideTR.pdf A Practical Guide to Training Restricted Boltzmann Machines]''. UTML TR 2010–003, University of Toronto.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;P(v,h) = \frac{1}{Z} e^{-E(v,h)}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Partition function (mathematics)|partition function]] defined as the sum of &lt;math&gt;e^{-E(v,h)}&lt;/math&gt; over all possible configurations (in other words, just a [[normalizing constant]] to ensure the probability distribution sums to 1). Similarly, the ([[Marginal distribution|marginal]]) probability of a visible (input) vector of booleans is the sum over all possible hidden layer configurations:&lt;ref name="guide"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;P(v) = \frac{1}{Z} \sum_h e^{-E(v,h)}&lt;/math&gt;

Since the RBM has the shape of a bipartite graph, with no intra-layer connections, the hidden unit activations are mutually [[Conditional independence|independent]] given the visible unit activations and conversely, the visible unit activations are mutually independent given the hidden unit activations.&lt;ref name="oncd"/&gt; That is, for &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; visible units and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; hidden units, the [[conditional probability]] of a configuration of the visible units {{mvar|v}}, given a configuration of the hidden units {{mvar|h}}, is

:&lt;math&gt;P(v|h) = \prod_{i=1}^m P(v_i|h)&lt;/math&gt;.

Conversely, the conditional probability of {{mvar|h}} given {{mvar|v}} is

:&lt;math&gt;P(h|v) = \prod_{j=1}^n P(h_j|v)&lt;/math&gt;.

The individual activation probabilities are given by

:&lt;math&gt;P(h_j=1|v) = \sigma \left(b_j + \sum_{i=1}^m w_{i,j} v_i \right)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\,P(v_i=1|h) = \sigma \left(a_i + \sum_{j=1}^n w_{i,j} h_j \right)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[Logistic function|logistic sigmoid]].

The visible units of RBM can be [[Multinomial distribution|multinomial]], although the hidden units are [[Bernoulli distribution|Bernoulli]]. In this case, the logistic function for visible units is replaced by the [[softmax function]]

:&lt;math&gt;P(v_i^k = 1|h) = \frac{\exp(a_i^k + \Sigma_j W_{ij}^k h_j)} {\Sigma_{k'=1}^K \exp(a_i^{k'} + \Sigma_j W_{ij}^{k'} h_j)}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''K'' is the number of discrete values that the visible values have. They are applied in topic modeling,&lt;ref name="softTM"/&gt; and [[Recommender system|recommender systems]].&lt;ref name="softCF"/&gt;

==Training algorithm==
Restricted Boltzmann machines are trained to maximize the product of probabilities assigned to some training set &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; (a matrix, each row of which is treated as a visible vector &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;),

:&lt;math&gt;\arg\max_W \prod_{v \in V} P(v)&lt;/math&gt;

or equivalently, to maximize the [[Expected value|expected]] [[log probability]] of a training sample &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; selected randomly from &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;:&lt;ref name="cdconvergence"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RBMTutorial"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\arg\max_W \mathbb{E} \left[ \log P(v)\right]&lt;/math&gt;

The algorithm most often used to train RBMs, that is, to optimize the weight vector &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;, is the contrastive divergence (CD) algorithm due to [[Geoffrey_Hinton|Hinton]], originally developed to train PoE ([[product of experts]]) models.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Hinton (1999). [http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/publications/papers/06-1999.pdf Products of Experts]. ''ICANN 1999''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hinton | first1 = G. E. | title = Training Products of Experts by Minimizing Contrastive Divergence | doi = 10.1162/089976602760128018 | journal = Neural Computation | volume = 14 | issue = 8 | pages = 1771–1800 | year = 2002 | pmid =  12180402| url = http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/absps/tr00-004.pdf| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The algorithm performs [[Gibbs sampling]] and is used inside a [[gradient descent]] procedure (similar to the way backpropagation is used inside such a procedure when training feedforward neural nets) to compute weight update.

The basic, single-step contrastive divergence (CD-1) procedure for a single sample can be summarized as follows:

# Take a training sample {{mvar|v}}, compute the probabilities of the hidden units and sample a hidden activation vector {{mvar|h}} from this probability distribution.
# Compute the [[outer product]] of {{mvar|v}} and {{mvar|h}} and call this the ''positive gradient''.
# From {{mvar|h}}, sample a reconstruction {{mvar|v'}} of the visible units, then resample the hidden activations {{mvar|h'}} from this. (Gibbs sampling step)
# Compute the [[outer product]] of {{mvar|v'}} and {{mvar|h'}} and call this the ''negative gradient''.
# Let the update to the weight matrix &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; be the positive gradient minus the negative gradient, times some learning rate: &lt;math&gt;\Delta W = \epsilon (vh^\mathsf{T} - v'h'^\mathsf{T})&lt;/math&gt;.
# Update the biases {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} analogously: &lt;math&gt;\Delta a = \epsilon (v - v')&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Delta b = \epsilon (h - h')&lt;/math&gt;.

{{Graph families defined by their automorphisms}}
In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] field of [[graph theory]], a '''semi-symmetric graph''' is an [[undirected graph]] that is [[edge-transitive graph|edge-transitive]] and [[regular graph|regular]], but not [[Vertex-transitive graph|vertex-transitive]]. In other words, a graph is semi-symmetric if each vertex has the same number of incident edges, and there is a symmetry taking any of the graph's edges to any other of its edges, but there is some pair of vertices such that no symmetry maps the first into the second.

==Properties==
A semi-symmetric graph must be [[bipartite graph|bipartite]], and its [[Graph automorphism|automorphism group]] must act [[Transitive group action|transitively]] on each of the two vertex sets of the bipartition.  For instance, in the diagram of the [[Folkman graph]] shown here, green vertices can not be mapped to red ones by any automorphism, but every two vertices of the same color are symmetric with each other.

==History==
Semi-symmetric graphs were first studied E. Dauber, a student of F. Harary, in a paper, no longer available, titled "On line- but not point-symmetric graphs".  This was seen by [[Jon Folkman]], whose paper, published in 1967, includes the smallest semi-symmetric graph, now known as the [[Folkman graph]], on 20 vertices.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

 | doi = 10.1016/S0021-9800(67)80069-3
 | issue = 3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
The term "semi-symmetric" was first used by Klin ''et al.'' in a paper they published in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Klin, Lauri &amp; Ziv-Av|title=Links between two semisymmetric graphs on 112 vertices through the lens of association schemes|date=2011|url=http://www.math.bgu.ac.il/~zivav/math/klz.pdf|accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cubic graphs==
The smallest [[cubic graph|cubic]] semi-symmetric graph (that is, one in which each vertex is incident to exactly three edges) is the [[Gray graph]] on 54 vertices. It was first observed to be semi-symmetric by {{harvtxt|Bouwer|1968}}. It was proven to be the smallest cubic semi-symmetric graph by [[Dragan Marušič]] and Aleksander Malnič.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

 | volume = 11 | pages = 533–535 | year = 1968
 | doi = 10.4153/CMB-1968-063-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

All the cubic semi-symmetric graphs on up to 768 vertices are known. According to [[Marston Conder|Conder]], Malnič, Marušič and Potočnik, the four smallest possible cubic semi-symmetric graphs after the Gray graph are the Iofinova&amp;ndash;Ivanov graph on 110 vertices, the [[Ljubljana graph]] on 112 vertices,&lt;ref name="LUB"&gt;{{citation

==Definition==
In Australia layering and spoofing in 2014 referred to the act of "submitting a genuine order on one side of the book and multiple orders at different prices on the other side of the book to give the impression of substantial supply/demand, with a view to sucking in other orders to hit the genuine order. After the genuine order trades, the multiple orders on the other side are rapidly withdrawn."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.inhouselegal.com.au/Compliance_Course/lecture_4.htm |title=Market Manipulation and Related Misconduct |work=Inhouse Legal Solutions Pty Limited |date=April 12, 2014|accessdate=April 25, 2015 |location=Sydney, Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2012 report Finansinspektionen (FI), the Swedish [[Financial Supervisory Authority (Sweden)|Financial Supervisory Authority]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fi.se/Templates/Page____2618.aspx Who we are]&lt;/ref&gt; defined spoofing/layering as "a strategy of placing orders that is intended to manipulate the price of an instrument, for example through a combination of buy and sell orders."&lt;ref name="FI_Sweden_2012" /&gt;

In the U.S. Department of Justice April 21, 2015 complaint of market manipulation and fraud laid against Navinder Singh Sarao,&lt;ref name="Bloomberg_2015" /&gt; — dubbed the Hounslow day-trader&lt;ref name="Guardian_2015_April_25"&gt;{{citation |title=The trillion-dollar questions over the flash crash and the Hound of Hounslow |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/apr/25/flash-crash-hound-of-hounslow-trillion-dollar-question |work=The Guardian |date=April 25, 2015 |accessdate=April 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  — appeared "to have used this 188-and-289-lot spoofing technique in certain instances to intensify the manipulative effects of his dynamic layering technique...The purpose of these bogus orders is to trick other market participants and manipulate the product's market price."&lt;ref name="Reuters_April21_2015" /&gt; He employed the technique of dynamic layering, a form of market manipulation in which traders "place large sell orders for contracts" tied to the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index.

==Milestone case against spoofing==

In July 2013 the US [[Commodity Futures Trading Commission]] (CFTC) and Britain's [[Financial Conduct Authority]] (FCA) brought a milestone case against spoofing which represents the first Dodd-Frank Act application.&lt;ref name="Finance_Magnates_2013"&gt;{{citation |title=CFTC Fines Algorithmic Trader $2.8 Million For Spoofing In The First Market Abuse Case Brought By Dodd-Frank Act, And Imposes Ban |url=http://www.financemagnates.com/forex/regulation/cftc-fines-algorithmic-trader-2-8-million-for-spoofing-in-the-first-market-abuse-case-brought-by-dodd-frank-act/ |first=Andrew Saks |last=McLeod |date=July 22, 2013 |accessdate=April 25, 2015 |work=Finance Magnates}}&lt;/ref&gt; A federal grand jury in Chicago indicted Panther Energy Trading and [[Michael Coscia]], a [[High-frequency trading|high-frequency trader]]. In 2011 Coscia placed spoofed orders through CME Group Inc. and European futures markets with profits of almost $1.6 million. Coscia was charged with six counts of spoofing with each count carrying a maximum sentence of ten years in prison and a maximum fine of one million dollars.&lt;ref name="Bloomberg_2015_Coscia"&gt;{{citation |title=Trader Charged With Spoofing Market Loses Dismissal Bid |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-04-16/first-trader-charged-with-market-spoofing-loses-dismissal-bid |date=April 16, 2015 |accessdate=April 25, 2015 |first=Andrew M |last=Harris }}&lt;/ref&gt; The illegal activity undertaken by Coscia and his firm took place in a six-week period from "August 8, 2011 through October 18, 2011 on CME Group’s Globex trading platform."&lt;ref name="Finance_Magnates_2013" /&gt; They used a "computer algorithm that was designed to unlawfully place and quickly cancel orders in exchange-traded futures contracts." They placed a "relatively small order to sell futures that they did want to execute, which they quickly followed with several large buy orders at successively higher prices that they intended to cancel. By placing the large buy orders, Mr. Coscia and Panther sought to give the market the impression that there was significant buying interest, which suggested that prices would soon rise, raising the likelihood that other market participants would buy from the small order Coscia and Panther were then offering to sell."&lt;ref name="Finance_Magnates_2013" /&gt;

Britain's FCA is also fining Coscia and his firm approximately $900,000 for "taking advantage of the price movements generated by his layering strategy" relating to his market abuse activities on the [[Intercontinental Exchange|ICE Futures]] Europe exchange.  They earned US$279,920 in profits over the six weeks period "at the expense of other market participants – primarily other High Frequency Traders or traders using algorithmic and/or automated systems."&lt;ref name="Finance_Magnates_2013" /&gt;

==Providence vs Wall Street==

On 18 April 2014 [[Robbins Geller Rudman &amp; Dowd LLP]] filed a class-action lawsuit on behalf of the city of Providence, Rhode Island in Federal Court in the Southern District of New York. The complaint in the high frequency matter named "every major stock exchange in the U.S." This includes the [[New York Stock Exchange]], [[Nasdaq]], [[BATS Global Markets|Better Alternative Trading System (Bats)]] — an [[electronic communication network]] (ECN)&lt;ref name="BATS_2008"&gt;{{citation  | title = Capitalists of the Prairie   | work = [[Newsweek]]   | date = September 12, 2008   | url = http://www.newsweek.com/2008/09/11/capitalists-of-the-prairie.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and [[Direct Edge]] among others. The suit also names major Wall Street firms including but not limited to, [[Goldman Sachs]], [[Citigroup]], [[JPMorgan]] and the [[Bank of America]]. High-frequency trading firms and [[hedge funds]] are also named in the lawsuit.&lt;ref name="wallstreetonparade_2014"&gt;{{citation |title=The High Frequency Trading Lawsuit That Has Wall Street Running Scared |first=Pam |last=Martens |date=May 13, 2014 |accessdate=April 25, 2014 |url=http://wallstreetonparade.com/2014/05/the-high-frequency-trading-lawsuit-that-has-wall-street-running-scared/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lawsuit claimed that, "For at least the last five years, the Defendants routinely engaged in at least the following manipulative, self-dealing and deceptive conduct," which included "spoofing – where the HFT Defendants send out orders with corresponding cancellations, often at the opening or closing of the stock market, in order to manipulate the market price of a security and/or induce a particular market reaction."&lt;ref name="wallstreetonparade_2014" /&gt;

{{main|Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act}}

CFTC’s Enforcement Director, David Meister, explained the difference between legal and illegal use of algorithmic trading,&lt;ref name="Finance_Magnates_2013" /&gt;

{{quote|“While forms of algorithmic trading are of course lawful, using a computer program that is written to spoof the market is illegal and will not be tolerated.

On April 21, 2015, five years after the incident, the U.S. Department of Justice laid "22 criminal counts, including fraud and market manipulation"&lt;ref name="Bloomberg_2015" /&gt; against Navinder Singh Sarao, who became known as the Hounslow day-trader. Among the charges included was the use of spoofing algorithms, in which first, just prior to the Flash Crash, he placed thousands of [[E-Mini S&amp;P|E-mini S&amp;P 500 stock index futures contract]] orders.&lt;ref name="Bloomberg_2015" /&gt; These orders, amounting to about "$200 million worth of bets that the market would fall" were "replaced or modified 19,000 times" before they were cancelled that afternoon.&lt;ref name="Bloomberg_2015" /&gt; Spoofing, layering and front-running are now banned.&lt;ref name="Traders_Magazine_2015" /&gt; The CTFC concluded that Sarao "was at least significantly responsible for the order imbalances" in the derivatives market which affected stock markets and exacerbated the flash crash.&lt;ref name="Bloomberg_2015"&gt;{{citation |work=Bloomberg News |title=Mystery Trader Armed With Algorithms Rewrites Flash Crash |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-04-22/mystery-trader-armed-with-algorithms-rewrites-flash-crash-story |accessdate=25 April 2015 |first1=Silla |last1=Brush |first2=Tom |last2= Schoenberg |first3=Suzi |last3=Ring}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sarao began his alleged market manipulation in 2009 with commercially available trading software whose code he modified "so he could rapidly place and cancel orders automatically."&lt;ref name="Bloomberg_2015" /&gt; Sarao is a 36-year-old small-time trader  who worked from his parents’ modest semi-attached stucco house in [[Hounslow]] in suburban west London.&lt;ref name="Bloomberg_2015" /&gt; ''Traders Magazine'' correspondent John Bates argues that by April 2015, traders can still manipulate and impact markets in spite of regulators and banks' new, improved monitoring of automated trade systems.&lt;ref name="Traders_Magazine_2015"&gt;{{citation |title=Post Flash Crash, Regulators Still Use Bicycles To Catch Ferraris: Blaming the Flash Crash on a UK man who lives with his parents is like blaming lightning for starting a fire |work=Traders Magazine Online News |date=April 24, 2015 |accessdate=April 25, 2014 |first=John |last=Bates |url=http://www.tradersmagazine.com/news/technology/post-flash-crash-regulators-still-use-bicycles-to-catch-ferraris-113762-1.html?ET=tradersmagazine%3Ae4256762%3A1181926a%3A&amp;st=email }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Economist_2015"&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.economist.com/news/business-and-finance/21649095-curious-case-hounslow-day-trader-flash-boy |title=Policing financial markets: Flash boy: The curious case of the Hounslow day-trader |date=April 25, 2015 |accessdate=April 26, 2015 |work=[[The Economist]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; For years, Sarao denounced high-frequency traders, some of them billion-dollar organisations, who mass manipulate the market by generating and retract numerous buy and sell orders every millisecond ("[[quote stuffing]]") — which he witnessed when placing trades at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).

{{quote|"The Flash Crash was a near miss. It taught us something important, if uncomfortable, about our state of knowledge of modern financial markets. Not just that it was imperfect, but that these imperfections may magnify, sending systemic shockwaves. Technology allows us to thin-slice time. But thinner technological slices may make for fatter market tails. Flash Crashes, like car crashes, may be more severe the greater the velocity. Physical catastrophes alert us to the costs of ignoring these events, of normalizing deviance. There is nothing normal about recent deviations in financial markets. The race to zero may have contributed to those abnormalities, adding liquidity during a monsoon and absorbing it during a drought. This fattens tail risk. Understanding and correcting those tail events is a systemic issue. It may call for new rules of the road for trading. Grit in the wheels, like grit on the roads, could help forestall the next crash."|Andrew Haldane, Bank of England July 8, 2011 page 18}}

[[File:(x^2)sin(x^(-1)).png|thumb|300px|Illustration of the squeeze theorem]]
[[File:Sandwich lemma.svg|thumb|300px|When a sequence lies between two other converging sequences with the same limit, it also converges to this limit.]]

In [[calculus]], the '''squeeze theorem''', also known as the '''pinching theorem''', the '''sandwich theorem''', the '''sandwich rule''', and sometimes the '''squeeze lemma''', is a [[theorem]] regarding the [[limit of a function]]. 

The squeeze theorem is used in calculus and [[mathematical analysis]]. It is typically used to confirm the limit of a function via comparison with two other functions whose limits are known or easily computed. It was first used geometrically by the [[mathematician]]s [[Archimedes]] and [[Eudoxus of Cnidus|Eudoxus]] in an effort to compute [[pi|{{pi}}]], and was formulated in modern terms by [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]].

In many languages (e.g. French, German, Italian and Russian), the squeeze theorem is also known as the '''two policemen (and a drunk) theorem''', or some variation thereof.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}  The story is that if two policemen are escorting a drunk prisoner between them, and both officers go to a cell, then (regardless of the path taken, and the fact that the prisoner may be wobbling about between the policemen) the prisoner must also end up in the cell.

== Statement ==
The squeeze theorem is formally stated as follows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sohrab|first1=Houshang H.|title=Basic Real Analysis|date=2003|publisher=[[Birkhäuser]]|isbn=978-1-4939-1840-9|page=104|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QnpqBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA104}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Let ''I'' be an [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] having the point ''a'' as a limit point.  Let ''g'', ''f'', and ''h'' be [[function (mathematics)|functions]] defined on ''I'', except possibly at ''a'' itself. Suppose that for every ''x'' in ''I'' not equal to ''a'', we have

: &lt;math&gt;g(x) \leq f(x) \leq h(x) &lt;/math&gt;

and also suppose that

: &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to a} g(x) = \lim_{x \to a} h(x) = L. &lt;/math&gt;

Then &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L.&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* The functions &lt;math display="inline"&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math display="inline"&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; are said to be [[upper bound|lower and upper bounds]] (respectively) of &lt;math display="inline"&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;.
* Here, &lt;math display="inline"&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is ''not'' required to lie in the [[interior (topology)|interior]] of &lt;math display="inline"&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;. Indeed, if &lt;math display="inline"&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is an endpoint of &lt;math display="inline"&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;, then the above limits are left- or right-hand limits.
* A similar statement holds for infinite intervals: for example, if &lt;math display="inline"&gt;I=(0, \infty)&lt;/math&gt;, then the conclusion holds, taking the limits as &lt;math display="inline"&gt;x \rightarrow \infty&lt;/math&gt;.
This theorem is also valid for sequences. Let &lt;math&gt;(a_n), (c_n)&lt;/math&gt; be two sequences converging to &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;(b_n)&lt;/math&gt; a sequence. If &lt;math&gt;\forall n\geqslant N, N\in\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt;a_n\leqslant b_n\leqslant c_n&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;(b_n)&lt;/math&gt; also converges to &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt;.

===Proof===
From the above hypotheses we have, taking the [[limit inferior]] and superior:
:&lt;math&gt;L=\lim_{x \to a} g(x)\leq\liminf_{x\to a}f(x) \leq  \limsup_{x\to a}f(x)\leq \lim_{x \to a}h(x)=L,&lt;/math&gt;
so all the inequalities are indeed equalities, and the thesis immediately follows.

A direct proof, using the &lt;math&gt;(\epsilon, \delta)&lt;/math&gt;-definition of limit, would be to prove that for all real &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\epsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; there exists a real &lt;math&gt;\delta &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; such that for all &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;|x - a| &lt; \delta&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;|f(x) - L| &lt; \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;. Symbolically,

: &lt;math&gt; \forall \epsilon &gt; 0, \exists \delta &gt; 0 : \forall x, (|x - a | &lt; \delta \ \Rightarrow  |f(x) - L |&lt; \epsilon).&lt;/math&gt;

As

: &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to a} g(x) = L &lt;/math&gt;

means that

: &lt;math&gt; \forall \varepsilon &gt; 0, \exists \ \delta_1 &gt; 0 : \forall x\ (|x - a| &lt; \delta_1 \ \Rightarrow \ |g(x) - L |&lt; \varepsilon).\qquad (1)&lt;/math&gt;

and 
: &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to a} h(x) = L &lt;/math&gt;

means that

: &lt;math&gt; \forall \varepsilon &gt; 0, \exists \ \delta_2 &gt; 0 : \forall x\ (|x - a | &lt; \delta_2\ \Rightarrow \ |h(x) - L |&lt; \varepsilon),\qquad (2)&lt;/math&gt;

then we have

: &lt;math&gt;g(x) \leq f(x) \leq h(x) &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;g(x) - L\leq f(x) - L\leq h(x) - L&lt;/math&gt;

We can choose &lt;math&gt;\delta:=\min\left\{\delta_1,\delta_2\right\}&lt;/math&gt;. Then, if &lt;math&gt;|x - a|&lt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;, combining (1) and (2), we have

: &lt;math&gt; - \varepsilon &lt; g(x) - L\leq f(x) - L\leq h(x) - L\ &lt; \varepsilon, &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; - \varepsilon &lt; f(x) - L &lt; \varepsilon &lt;/math&gt;,

which completes the proof.  &lt;math&gt;\blacksquare&lt;/math&gt;

The proof for sequences is very similar, using the &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;-definition of a limit of a sequence.

== Statement for series ==
There is also the squeeze theorem for series, which can be stated as follows:{{cn|date=March 2018}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;Let &lt;math&gt;\sum_n a_n, \sum_n c_n&lt;/math&gt; be two convergent series. If &lt;math&gt;\exists N\in\mathbb{N} &lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\forall n&gt;N, a_n\leqslant b_n \leqslant c_n &lt;/math&gt;then &lt;math&gt;\sum_n b_n &lt;/math&gt; also converges.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Proof ===
Let &lt;math&gt;\sum_n a_n, \sum_n c_n&lt;/math&gt; be two convergent series. Hence, the sequences &lt;math&gt;\left(\sum_{k=1}^n a_n\right)_{n=1}^{\infty}, \left(\sum_{k=1}^n c_n\right)_{n=1}^{\infty} &lt;/math&gt; are Cauchy. That is, for fixed &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&gt;0 &lt;/math&gt;,

&lt;math&gt;\exists N_1\in\mathbb{N} &lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\forall n&gt;m&gt;N_1, \left|\sum_{k=1}^na_n-\sum_{k=1}^ma_n\right|&lt;\epsilon \Longrightarrow \left|\sum_{k=m+1}^n a_n\right|&lt;\epsilon \Longrightarrow -\epsilon&lt;\sum_{k=m+1}^n a_n&lt;\epsilon &lt;/math&gt; (1)

and similarly &lt;math&gt;\exists N_2\in\mathbb{N} &lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\forall n&gt;m&gt;N_2, \left|\sum_{k=1}^nc_n-\sum_{k=1}^mc_n\right|&lt;\epsilon \Longrightarrow \left|\sum_{k=m+1}^n c_n\right|&lt;\epsilon \Longrightarrow -\epsilon&lt;\sum_{k=m+1}^n c_n&lt;\epsilon &lt;/math&gt; (2).

We know that &lt;math&gt;\exists N_3\in\mathbb{N} &lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\forall n&gt;N_1, a_n\leqslant b_n \leqslant c_n &lt;/math&gt;. Hence, &lt;math&gt;\forall n&gt;m&gt;\max\{N_1,N_2,N_3\} &lt;/math&gt;, we have combining (1) and (2):

&lt;math&gt;a_n\leqslant b_n\leqslant c_n \Longrightarrow \sum_{k=m+1}^n a_n \leqslant \sum_{k=m+1}^n b_n \leqslant \sum_{k=m+1}^n c_n \Longrightarrow -\epsilon&lt; \sum_{k=m+1}^n b_n &lt;\epsilon \Longrightarrow \left|\sum_{k=m+1}^n b_n\right|&lt;\epsilon \Longrightarrow \left|\sum_{k=1}^n b_n-\sum_{k=1}^m b_n\right|&lt;\epsilon &lt;/math&gt;.

Therefore &lt;math&gt;\left(\sum_{k=1}^n b_n\right)_{n=1}^{\infty} &lt;/math&gt;is a Cauchy sequence. So &lt;math&gt;\sum_n b_n &lt;/math&gt; converges. &lt;math&gt;\blacksquare&lt;/math&gt;

== Examples ==

=== First example ===

[[File:Squeeze theorem example.svg|thumb|right|250px|''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;sin(1/''x'') being squeezed in the limit as x goes to 0]]

The limit

: &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to 0}x^2 \sin(\tfrac{1}{x})&lt;/math&gt;

cannot be determined through the limit law

: &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to a}(f(x)\cdot g(x)) = 
\lim_{x \to a}f(x)\cdot \lim_{x \to a}g(x),&lt;/math&gt;

because

: &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to 0}\sin(\tfrac{1}{x})&lt;/math&gt;

does not exist.

However, by the definition of the [[sine function]],

: &lt;math&gt;-1 \le \sin(\tfrac{1}{x}) \le 1. &lt;/math&gt;

It follows that

: &lt;math&gt;-x^2 \le x^2 \sin(\tfrac{1}{x}) \le x^2 &lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to 0}-x^2 = \lim_{x\to 0}x^2 = 0&lt;/math&gt;, by the squeeze theorem, &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to 0} x^2 \sin(\tfrac{1}{x})&lt;/math&gt; must also be 0.

=== Second example ===
[[File:Limit_sin_x_x.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Comparing areas:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}&amp;\, A(\triangle ADF) \geq A(\text{sector}\, ADB) \geq A(\triangle ADB)\\ \Rightarrow &amp;\, \frac{1}{2}\cdot \tan(x)\cdot 1 \geq \frac{x}{2\pi}\cdot \pi \geq \frac{1}{2}\cdot \sin(x)\cdot 1\\ \Rightarrow &amp;\, \frac{\sin(x)}{\cos(x)} \geq x \geq \sin(x)\\ \Rightarrow &amp;\, \frac{\cos(x)}{\sin(x)} \leq \frac{1}{x} \leq \frac{1}{\sin(x)} \\ \Rightarrow &amp;\, \cos(x) \leq \frac{\sin(x)}{x} \leq 1 \end{align} &lt;/math&gt;]]
Probably the best-known examples of finding a limit by squeezing are the proofs of the equalities

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \lim_{x\to 0} \frac{\sin(x)}{x} =1, \\[10pt]
&amp; \lim_{x\to 0} \frac{1 - \cos(x)}{x} = 0.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The first limit follows by means of the squeeze theorem from the fact that

: &lt;math&gt; \cos x \leq \frac{\sin(x)}{x} \leq 1 &lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Selim G. Krejn, V.N. Uschakowa: ''Vorstufe zur höheren Mathematik''. Springer, 2013, {{ISBN|9783322986283}}, pp.
 [https://books.google.de/books?id=-yXMBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA80 80-81] (German). See also [[Sal Khan]]: [https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-ab/limits-from-equations-ab/squeeze-theorem-ab/v/proof-lim-sin-x-x ''Proof: limit of (sin x)/x at x=0''] (video, [[Khan Academy]])&lt;/ref&gt;

for ''x'' close enough to 0. The correctness of which for positive x can be seen by simple geometric reasoning (see drawing) that can be extended to negative x as well. The second limit follows from the squeeze theorem and the fact that

: &lt;math&gt; 0 \leq  \frac{1 - \cos(x)}{x}  \leq  x &lt;/math&gt;
for ''x'' close enough to 0. This can be derived by replacing &lt;math&gt;\sin(x)&lt;/math&gt; in the earlier fact by &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{1-\cos(x)^2}&lt;/math&gt; and squaring the resulting inequality.

These two limits are used in proofs of the fact that the derivative of the sine function is the cosine function.  That fact is relied on in other proofs of derivatives of trigonometric functions.

=== Third example ===

It is possible to show that

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{d\theta} \tan\theta = \sec^2\theta &lt;/math&gt;

by squeezing, as follows.

[[File:Tangent.squeeze.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|right]]

In the illustration at right, the area of the smaller of the two shaded sectors of the circle is

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{\sec^2\theta\,\Delta\theta}{2}, &lt;/math&gt;

since the radius is sec&amp;nbsp;''&amp;theta;'' and the arc on the [[unit circle]] has length&amp;nbsp;Δ''&amp;theta;''.  Similarly, the area of the larger of the two shaded sectors is

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{\sec^2(\theta + \Delta\theta)\,\Delta\theta}{2}. &lt;/math&gt;

What is squeezed between them is the triangle whose base is the vertical segment whose endpoints are the two dots.  The length of the base of the triangle is&amp;nbsp;tan(''&amp;theta;''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;Δ''&amp;theta;'')&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;tan(''&amp;theta;''), and the height is&amp;nbsp;1.  The area of the triangle is therefore

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{\tan(\theta + \Delta\theta) - \tan(\theta)}{2}. &lt;/math&gt;

From the inequalities

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{\sec^2\theta\,\Delta\theta}{2} \le \frac{\tan(\theta + \Delta\theta) - \tan(\theta)}{2} \le \frac{\sec^2(\theta + \Delta\theta)\,\Delta\theta}{2} &lt;/math&gt;

we deduce that

: &lt;math&gt; \sec^2\theta \le \frac{\tan(\theta + \Delta\theta) - \tan(\theta)}{\Delta\theta} \le \sec^2(\theta + \Delta\theta),&lt;/math&gt;

provided&amp;nbsp;Δ''&amp;theta;''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0, and the inequalities are reversed if&amp;nbsp;Δ''&amp;theta;''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;0.  Since the first and third expressions approach sec&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''&amp;theta;'' as Δ''&amp;theta;''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;0, and the middle expression approaches (''d''/''d&amp;theta;'')&amp;nbsp;tan&amp;nbsp;''&amp;theta;'', the desired result follows.

=== Fourth example ===

The squeeze theorem can still be used in multivariable calculus but the lower (and upper functions) must be below (and above) the target function not just along a path but around the entire neighborhood of the point of interest and it only works if the function really does have a limit there. It can, therefore, be used to prove that a function has a limit at a point, but it can never be used to prove that a function does not have a limit at a point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Chapter 15.2 Limits and Continuity|pages=909–910|title=Multivariable Calculus|year=2008|last1=Stewart|first1=James|authorlink1=James_Stewart_(mathematician)|edition=6th|isbn=0495011630}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\lim_{(x,y) \to (0, 0)} \frac{x^2 y}{x^2+y^2}&lt;/math&gt;

cannot be found by taking any number of limits along paths that pass through the point, but since

: &lt;math&gt;0 \leq \frac{x^2}{x^2+y^2} \leq 1&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;-\left | y \right \vert \leq y \leq \left | y \right \vert &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;-\left | y \right \vert \leq \frac{x^2 y}{x^2+y^2} \leq \left | y \right \vert &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\lim_{(x,y) \to (0, 0)} -\left | y \right \vert = 0&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\lim_{(x,y) \to (0, 0)} \left |y \right \vert = 0&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;0  \leq  \lim_{(x,y) \to (0, 0)} \frac{x^2 y}{x^2+y^2}  \leq  0&lt;/math&gt;

therefore, by the squeeze theorem,

: &lt;math&gt;\lim_{(x,y) \to (0, 0)} \frac{x^2 y}{x^2+y^2} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

For other stochastic modelling applications, please see [[Monte Carlo method]] and [[Stochastic asset model]]s.  For mathematical definition, please see [[Stochastic process]].''


"[[Stochastic]]" means being or having a [[random variable]]. A '''stochastic model''' is a tool for estimating [[probability distribution]]s of potential outcomes by allowing for random variation in one or more inputs over time. The random variation is usually based on fluctuations observed in historical data for a selected period using standard [[time-series]] techniques. Distributions of potential outcomes are derived from a large number of [[simulation]]s (stochastic projections) which reflect the random variation in the input(s).

Its application initially started in [[physics]]. It is now being applied in [[engineering]], [[life sciences]], [[social science]]s, and [[finance]]. See also [[Economic capital]].

==Valuation==
Like any other company, an [[insurer]] has to show that its [[assets]] exceeds its [[liability (financial accounting)|liabilities]] to be solvent. In the insurance industry, however, assets and liabilities are not known entities. They depend on how many policies result in claims, inflation from now until the claim, investment returns during that period, and so on.

So the valuation of an insurer involves a set of projections, looking at what is expected to happen, and thus coming up with the best estimate for assets and liabilities, and therefore for the company's level of solvency.

==Deterministic approach==
The simplest way of doing this, and indeed the primary method used, is to look at best estimates.

The projections in financial analysis usually use the most likely rate of claim, the most likely investment return, the most likely rate of inflation, and so on. The projections in engineering analysis usually use both the most likely rate and the most critical rate.  The result provides a point estimate - the best single estimate of what the company's current solvency position is, or multiple points of estimate - depends on the problem definition. Selection and identification of parameter values are frequently a challenge to less experienced analysts.

The downside of this approach is it does not fully cover the fact that there is a whole range of possible outcomes and some are more probable and some are less.

==Stochastic modelling==
A stochastic model would be to set up a projection model which looks at a single policy, an entire portfolio or an entire company. But rather than setting investment returns according to their most likely estimate, for example, the model uses random variations to look at what investment conditions might be like.

Based on a set of random variables, the experience of the policy/portfolio/company is projected, and the outcome is noted. Then this is done again with a new set of random variables. In fact, this process is repeated thousands of times.

At the end, a distribution of outcomes is available which shows not only the most likely estimate but what ranges are reasonable too. The most likely estimate is given by the distribution curve's (formally known as the [[Probability density function]]) center of mass which is typically also the peak(mode) of the curve, but may be different e.g. for asymmetric distributions.

This is useful when a policy or fund provides a guarantee, e.g. a minimum investment return of 5% per annum. A deterministic simulation, with varying scenarios for future investment return, does not provide a good way of estimating the cost of providing this guarantee. This is because it does not allow for the volatility of investment returns in each future time period or the chance that an extreme event in a particular time period leads to an investment return less than the guarantee. Stochastic modelling builds volatility and variability (randomness) into the simulation and therefore provides a better representation of real life from more angles.

==Numerical evaluations of quantities==
Stochastic models help to assess the interactions between variables, and are useful tools to numerically evaluate quantities, as they are usually implemented using Monte Carlo simulation techniques (see [[Monte Carlo method]]).  While there is an advantage here, in estimating quantities that would otherwise be difficult to obtain using analytical methods, a disadvantage is that such methods are limited by computing resources as well as simulation error.  Below are some examples:

===Means===

Using statistical notation, it is a well-known result that the [[mean]] of a function, f, of a [[random variable]] X is not necessarily the function of the mean of X.

For example, in application, applying the best estimate (defined as the mean) of investment returns to discount a set of cash flows will not necessarily give the same result as assessing the best estimate to the [[discounted cash flow]]s.

A stochastic model would be able to assess this latter quantity with simulations.

===Percentiles===

This idea is seen again when one considers percentiles (see [[percentile]]).  When assessing risks at specific percentiles, the factors that contribute to these levels are rarely at these percentiles themselves.  Stochastic models can be simulated to assess the percentiles of the aggregated distributions.

===Truncations and censors===

Truncating and censoring of data can also be estimated using stochastic models.  For instance, applying a non-proportional  [[reinsurance]] layer to the best estimate losses will not necessarily give us the best estimate of the losses after the reinsurance layer.  In a simulated stochastic model, the simulated losses can be made to "pass through" the layer and the resulting losses assessed appropriately.

==The asset model==
Although the text above referred to "random variations", the stochastic model does not just use any arbitrary set of values. The asset model is based on detailed studies of how markets behave, looking at averages, variations, correlations, and more.

The models and underlying parameters are chosen so that they fit historical economic data, and are expected to produce meaningful future projections.

There are many such [[stochastic investment model|models]], including the [[Wilkie investment model|Wilkie Model]], the [[Thompson Model]] and the [[Falcon Model]].

==The claims model==
The claims arising from policies or portfolios that the company has written can also be modelled using stochastic methods.  This is especially important in the general insurance sector, where the  claim severities can have high uncertainties.

===Frequency-Severity models===

Depending on the portfolios under investigation, a model can simulate all or some of the following factors stochastically:

*Number of claims
*Claim severities
*Timing of claims

Claims inflations can be applied, based on the inflation simulations that are consistent with the outputs of the asset model, as are dependencies between the losses of different portfolios.

The relative uniqueness of the policy portfolios written by a company in the general insurance sector means that claims models are typically tailor-made.

===Stochastic reserving models===

Estimating future claims liabilities might also involve estimating the uncertainty around the estimates of claim reserves.

See J Li's article "Comparison of Stochastic Reserving Models" (published in the ''Australian Actuarial Journal'', volume 12 issue 4) for a recent article on this topic.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2175">In mathematics, a '''supersingular variety''' is (usually) a smooth [[projective variety]] in nonzero [[Characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] such that for all ''n'' the [[slope]]s of the [[F-crystal|Newton polygon]] of the ''n''th [[crystalline cohomology]] are all&amp;nbsp;''n''/2 {{harv|de Jong|2014}}. For special classes of varieties such as elliptic curves it is common to use various ad hoc definitions of "supersingular", which are (usually) equivalent to the one given above.

The term "singular elliptic curve" (or "singular ''j''-invariant") was at one times used to refer to complex [[elliptic curve]]s whose ring of [[endomorphism]]s has rank&amp;nbsp;2, the maximum possible. [[Helmut Hasse]] discovered that, in finite characteristic, elliptic curves can have larger rings of endomorphisms of rank&amp;nbsp;4, and these were called "supersingular elliptic curves". Supersingular elliptic curves can also be characterized by the slopes of their crystalline cohomology, and the term "supersingular" was later extended to other varieties whose cohomology has similar properties. The terms "supersingular" or "singular" do not mean that the variety has singularites.

Examples include:
*[[Supersingular elliptic curve]]. Elliptic curves in non-zero characteristic with an unusually large ring of endomorphisms of rank 4. 
*[[Supersingular Abelian variety]] Sometimes defined to be an abelian variety isogenous to a product of supersingular elliptic curves, and sometimes defined to be an abelian variety of some rank ''g''  whose endomorphism ring has rank (2''g'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.  
*[[Supersingular K3 surface]]. Certain K3 surfaces in non-zero characteristic. 
*[[Supersingular Enriques surface]]. Certain Enriques surfaces in characteristic 2.
*A surface is called '''Shioda supersingular''' if the rank of its Néron–Severi group is equal to its second Betti number.
*A surface is called '''Artin supersingular''' if its formal Brauer group has infinite height.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2305">In mathematics, a '''Suslin tree''' is a [[tree (set theory)|tree]] of height [[First uncountable ordinal|ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]] such that
every branch and every [[antichain]] is at most [[Countable set|countable]]. They are named after [[Mikhail Yakovlevich Suslin]].

Every Suslin tree is an [[Aronszajn tree]].

The existence of a Suslin tree is [[Independence (mathematical logic)|independent]] of ZFC, and is equivalent to the existence of a [[Suslin line]] (shown by {{harvtxt|Kurepa|1935}}) or a [[Suslin algebra]]. The [[diamond principle]], a consequence of [[V=L]],  implies that there is a Suslin tree, and [[Martin's axiom]] MA(ℵ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) implies that there are no Suslin trees.

More generally, for any infinite cardinal κ, a κ-Suslin tree is a tree of height κ such that every branch and antichain has cardinality less than κ. In particular a Suslin tree is the same as a ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-Suslin tree.  {{harvtxt|Jensen|1972}} showed that if [[V=L]] then there is a κ-Suslin tree for every infinite [[successor cardinal]] κ. Whether the [[Generalized Continuum Hypothesis]] implies the existence of an ℵ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-Suslin tree, is a longstanding open problem.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1832">The '''tetralemma''' is a figure that features prominently in the [[Indian logic|logic of India]]. It states that with reference to any a logical proposition X, there are four possibilities:

: &lt;math&gt;X &lt;/math&gt; (affirmation)
: &lt;math&gt;\neg X&lt;/math&gt; (negation)
: &lt;math&gt;X \land\neg X&lt;/math&gt; (both)
: &lt;math&gt;\neg (X \lor \neg X) \iff X \land \neg X \iff \emptyset &lt;/math&gt; (neither)

see [[De Morgan's laws]].

==Catuskoti==
The history of fourfold negation, the [[Catuskoti]] (Sanskrit), is evident in the logico-epistemological tradition of India, given the categorical nomenclature Indian logic in Western discourse. Subsumed within the auspice of Indian logic, '[[Buddhist logic]]' has been particularly focused in its employment of the fourfold negation, as evidenced by the traditions of [[Nagarjuna]] and the [[Madhyamaka]], particularly the school of Madhyamaka given the retroactive nomenclature of [[Prasangika]] by the Tibetan Buddhist logico-epistemological tradition.

A variant of the tetralemma is used in the [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Ancient Greek philosophical]] schools of [[Democritus]]&lt;ref&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/democritus/#5&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pyrrhonism]]. [[Pyrrho]] includes it in his summary of his teachings, and [[Sextus Empiricus]] includes it among the Pyrrhonist Maxims.&lt;ref&gt;Sextus Empiricus, ''Outlines of Pyrrhonism'' Book 1, Section 19&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''time value of money''' is the greater benefit of receiving money now rather than later. It is founded on [[time preference]].

The time value of money explains why [[interest]] is paid or earned: Interest, whether it is on a [[bank deposit]] or [[debt]], compensates the depositor or lender for the time value of money.

It also underlies [[investment]]. [[Investor]]s are willing to forgo spending their money now only if they expect a favorable [[rate of return|return]] on their investment in the future, such that the increased value to be available later is sufficiently high to offset the preference to have money now.

==History==
The [[Talmud]] (~500 CE) recognizes the time value of money. In Tractate [[Makkot|Makkos]] page 3a the Talmud discusses a case where witnesses falsely claimed that the term of a loan was 30 days when it was actually 10 years. The false witnesses must pay the difference of the value of the loan "in a situation where he would be required to give the money back (within) thirty days..., and that same sum in a situation where he would be required to give the money back (within) 10 years...The difference is the sum that the testimony of the (false) witnesses sought to have the borrower lose; therefore, it is the sum that they must pay." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sefaria.org/Makkot.3a?lang=bi|title=Makkot 3a William Davidson Talmud online|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion was later described by [[Martín de Azpilcueta]] (1491–1586) of the [[School of Salamanca]].

==Calculations==
Time value of money problems involve the net value of cash flows at different points in time.

In a typical case, the  variables might be: a balance (the real or nominal value of a debt or a financial asset in terms of monetary units), a periodic rate of interest, the number of periods, and a series of cash flows. (In the case of a debt, cash flows are payments against principal and interest; in the case of a financial asset, these are contributions to or withdrawals from the balance.)  More generally, the cash flows may not be periodic but may be specified individually. Any of these variables may be the independent variable (the sought-for answer) in a given problem. For example, one may know that: the interest is 0.5% per period (per month, say); the number of periods is 60 (months); the initial balance (of the debt, in this case) is 25,000 units; and the final balance is 0 units.  The unknown variable may be the monthly payment that the borrower must pay.

For example, £100 invested for one year, earning 5% interest, will be worth £105 after one year; therefore, £100 paid now ''and'' £105 paid exactly one year later ''both'' have the same value to a recipient who expects 5% interest assuming that inflation would be zero percent. That is, £100 invested for one year at 5% interest has a ''future value'' of £105 under the assumption that inflation would be zero percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/articles/03/082703.asp|title=Understanding the Time Value of Money|first=Shauna|last=Carther|date=3 December 2003|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This principle allows for the valuation of a likely stream of income in the future, in such a way that annual incomes are [[Discounting|discounted]] and then added together, thus providing a lump-sum "present value" of the entire income stream; all of the standard calculations for time value of money derive from the most basic algebraic expression for the [[present value]] of a future sum, "discounted" to the present by an amount equal to the time value of money. For example, the future value sum &lt;math&gt;FV&lt;/math&gt; to be received in one year is discounted at the rate of interest &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; to give the present value sum &lt;math&gt;PV&lt;/math&gt;:
: &lt;math&gt;PV = \frac{FV}{(1+r)}&lt;/math&gt;

Some standard calculations based on the time value of money are:

* '''[[Present value]]''': The current worth of a future sum of money or stream of [[cash flows]], given a specified [[rate of return]]. Future cash flows are "discounted" at the ''discount&amp;nbsp;rate;'' the higher the discount rate, the lower the present value of the future cash flows. Determining the appropriate discount rate is the key to valuing future cash flows properly, whether they be earnings or obligations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/presentvalue.asp|title=Present Value - PV|first=Investopedia|last=Staff|date=25 November 2003|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Present value of an [[Annuity (finance theory)|annuity]]''': An annuity is a series of equal payments or receipts that occur at evenly spaced intervals. Leases and rental payments are examples.  The payments or receipts occur at the end of each period for an ordinary annuity while they occur at the beginning of each period for an annuity due.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getobjects.com/Components/Finance/TVM/pva.html|title=Present Value of an Annuity|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:'''Present value of a [[perpetuity]]''' is an infinite and constant stream of identical cash flows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/perpetuity.asp|title=Perpetuity|first=Investopedia|last=Staff|date=24 November 2003|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''[[Future value]]''': The value of an asset or cash at a specified date in the future, based on the value of that asset in the present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/futurevalue.asp|title=Future Value - FV|first=Investopedia|last=Staff|date=23 November 2003|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Future value of an annuity (FVA)''': The future value of a stream of payments (annuity), assuming the payments are invested at a given rate of interest.

There are several basic equations that represent the equalities listed above. The solutions may be found using (in most cases) the formulas, a financial calculator or a [[spreadsheet]]. The formulas are programmed into most financial calculators and several spreadsheet functions (such as PV, FV, RATE, NPER, and PMT).&lt;ref&gt;Hovey, M. (2005). Spreadsheet Modelling for Finance. Frenchs Forest, N.S.W.: Pearson Education Australia.&lt;/ref&gt;

For any of the equations below, the formula may also be rearranged to determine one of the other unknowns. In the case of the standard annuity formula, there is no closed-form algebraic solution for the interest rate (although financial calculators and spreadsheet programs can readily determine solutions through rapid trial and error algorithms).

These equations are frequently combined for particular uses. For example, [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] can be readily priced using these equations. A typical coupon bond is composed of two types of payments: a stream of coupon payments similar to an annuity, and a lump-sum [[return of capital]] at the end of the bond's [[Maturity (finance)|maturity]]—that is, a future payment. The two formulas can be combined to determine the present value of the bond.

An important note is that the interest rate ''i'' is the interest rate for the relevant period. For an annuity that makes one payment per year, ''i'' will be the annual interest rate. For an income or payment stream with a different payment schedule, the interest rate must be converted into the relevant periodic interest rate. For example, a monthly rate for a mortgage with monthly payments requires that the interest rate be divided by 12 (see the example below). See [[compound interest]] for details on converting between different periodic interest rates.

The rate of return in the calculations can be either the variable solved for, or a predefined variable that measures a discount rate, interest, inflation, rate of return, cost of equity, cost of debt or any number of other analogous concepts. The choice of the appropriate rate is critical to the exercise, and the use of an incorrect discount rate will make the results meaningless.

For calculations involving annuities, you must decide whether the payments are made at the end of each period (known as an ordinary annuity), or at the beginning of each period (known as an annuity due). If you are using a financial calculator or a [[spreadsheet]], you can usually set it for either calculation. The following formulas are for an ordinary annuity. If you want the answer for the present value of an annuity due, you can simply multiply the PV of an ordinary annuity by (1 + ''i'').

==Formula==
The following formula use these common variables:
* ''PV'' is the value at time=0 (present value)
* ''FV'' is the value at time=''n'' (future value)
* ''A'' is the value of the individual payments in each compounding period
* ''n'' is the number of periods (not necessarily an integer)
* ''i'' is the [[interest rate]] at which the amount compounds each period
* ''g'' is the growing rate of payments over each time period

===Future value of a present sum===
The [[future value]]  (''FV'')  formula is similar and uses the same variables.
:&lt;math&gt;  FV   \ = \  PV \cdot (1+i)^n &lt;/math&gt;

===Present value of a future sum===
The present value formula is the core formula for the time value of money; each of the other formulae is derived from this formula. For example, the annuity formula is the sum of a series of present value calculations.

The [[present value]] (''PV'') formula has four variables, each of which can be solved for by [[numerical methods]]:
:&lt;math&gt;  PV \ = \ \frac{FV}{(1+i)^n} &lt;/math&gt;

The cumulative [[present value]] of future cash flows can be calculated by summing the contributions of ''FV&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'', the value of cash flow at time ''t'':
:&lt;math&gt;  PV \ = \ \sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac{FV_{t}}{(1+i)^t} &lt;/math&gt;

Note that this series can be summed for a given value of ''n'', or when ''n'' is ∞.&lt;ref&gt;http://mathworld.wolfram.com/GeometricSeries.html Geometric Series&lt;/ref&gt; This is a very general formula, which leads to several important special cases given below.

===Present value of an annuity for n payment periods===
In this case the cash flow values remain the same throughout the ''n'' periods. The present value of an [[Annuity (finance theory)|annuity]] (PVA) formula has four variables, each of which can be solved for by numerical methods:
:&lt;math&gt;PV(A) \,=\,\frac{A}{i} \cdot \left[ {1-\frac{1}{\left(1+i\right)^n}} \right] &lt;/math&gt;

To get the PV of an [[Annuity (finance theory)#Annuity-due|annuity due]], multiply the above equation by (1 + ''i'').

===Present value of a growing annuity===
In this case each cash flow grows by a factor of (1+''g''). Similar to the formula for an annuity, the present value of a growing annuity (PVGA) uses the same variables with the addition of ''g'' as the rate of growth of the annuity (A is the annuity payment in the first period). This is a calculation that is rarely provided for on financial calculators.

'''Where i ≠ g :'''
:&lt;math&gt;PV(A)\,=\,{A \over (i-g)}\left[ 1- \left({1+g \over 1+i}\right)^n \right] &lt;/math&gt;
'''Where i = g :'''
:&lt;math&gt;PV(A)\,=\,{A \times n \over 1+i} &lt;/math&gt;

To get the PV of a growing [[Annuity (finance theory)#Annuity-due|annuity due]], multiply the above equation by (1 + ''i'').

===Present value of a perpetuity===
A [[perpetuity]] is payments of a set amount of money that occur on a routine basis and continue forever. When ''n'' → ∞, the ''PV'' of a perpetuity (a perpetual annuity) formula becomes a simple division.
:&lt;math&gt;PV(P) \ = \ { A \over i } &lt;/math&gt;

===Present value of a growing perpetuity===
When the perpetual annuity payment grows at a fixed rate (''g'', with ''g'' &lt; ''i'') the value is determined according to the following formula, obtained by setting ''n'' to infinity in the earlier formula for a growing perpetuity:

:&lt;math&gt;PV(A)\,=\,{A \over i-g}&lt;/math&gt;

In practice, there are few securities with precise characteristics, and the application of this valuation approach is subject to various qualifications and modifications. Most importantly, it is rare to find a growing perpetual annuity with fixed rates of growth and true perpetual cash flow generation. Despite these qualifications, the general approach may be used in valuations of real estate, equities, and other assets.

This is the well known [[Gordon model|Gordon Growth model]] used for [[stock valuation]].

===Future value of an annuity===
The future value (after ''n'' periods) of an annuity (FVA) formula has four variables, each of which can be solved for by numerical methods:
:&lt;math&gt;FV(A) \,=\,A\cdot\frac{\left(1+i\right)^n-1}{i}&lt;/math&gt;

To get the FV of an annuity due, multiply the above equation by (1 + i).

===Future value of a growing annuity===
The future value (after ''n'' periods) of a growing annuity (FVA) formula has five variables, each of which can be solved for by numerical methods:

'''Where i ≠ g :'''
:&lt;math&gt;FV(A) \,=\,A\cdot\frac{\left(1+i\right)^n-\left(1+g\right)^n}{i-g}&lt;/math&gt;
'''Where i = g :'''
:&lt;math&gt;FV(A) \,=\,A\cdot n(1+i)^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;

===Formula table===
The following table summarizes the different formulas commonly used in calculating the time value of money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ncees.org/exams/study-materials/download-fe-supplied-reference-handbook/|title=NCEES FE exam|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These values are often displayed in tables where the interest rate and time are specified.

==Derivations==

===Annuity derivation===
The formula for the present value of a regular stream of future payments (an annuity) is derived from a sum of the formula for future value of a single future payment, as below, where ''C'' is the payment amount and ''n'' the period.

A single payment C at future time ''m'' has the following future value at future time ''n'':

:&lt;math&gt;FV \ = C(1+i)^{n-m}&lt;/math&gt;

Summing over all payments from time 1 to time n, then reversing t

:&lt;math&gt;FVA \ = \sum_{m=1}^n C(1+i)^{n-m} \ = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} C(1+i)^k&lt;/math&gt;

Note that this is a [[geometric series]], with the initial value being ''a'' = ''C'', the multiplicative factor being 1 + ''i'', with ''n'' terms. Applying the formula for geometric series, we get

:&lt;math&gt;FVA \ = \frac{ C ( 1 - (1+i)^n )}{1 - (1+i)} \ = \frac{ C ( 1 - (1+i)^n )}{-i} &lt;/math&gt;

The present value of the annuity (PVA) is obtained by simply dividing by &lt;math&gt;(1+i)^n&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;PVA \ = \frac{FVA}{(1+i)^n} = \frac{C}{i} \left( 1 - \frac{1}{(1+i)^n} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Another simple and intuitive way to derive the future value of an annuity is to consider an endowment, whose interest is paid as the annuity, and whose principal remains constant. The principal of this hypothetical endowment can be computed as that whose interest equals the annuity payment amount:

:&lt;math&gt;\text{Principal} \times i = C&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\text{Principal} = C / i + {goal} &lt;/math&gt;

Note that no money enters or leaves the combined system of endowment principal + accumulated annuity payments, and thus the future value of this system can be computed simply via the future value formula:
:&lt;math&gt;FV = PV(1+i)^n&lt;/math&gt;

Initially, before any payments, the present value of the system is just the endowment principal (&lt;math&gt;PV = C/i&lt;/math&gt;). At the end, the future value is the endowment principal (which is the same) plus the future value of the total annuity payments (&lt;math&gt;FV = C/i + FVA&lt;/math&gt;). Plugging this back into the equation:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{C}{i} + FVA = \frac{C}{i} (1+i)^n&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;FVA = \frac{C}{i} \left[ \left(1+i \right)^n - 1 \right]&lt;/math&gt;

===Perpetuity derivation===
Without showing the formal derivation here, the perpetuity formula is derived from the annuity formula. Specifically, the term:
:&lt;math&gt; \left({1 - {1 \over { (1+i)^n } }}\right) &lt;/math&gt;
can be seen to approach the value of 1 as ''n'' grows larger. At infinity, it is equal to 1, leaving &lt;math&gt; {C \over i} &lt;/math&gt; as the only term remaining.

==Continuous compounding==
Rates are sometimes converted into the [[continuous compounding|continuous compound interest]] rate equivalent because the continuous equivalent is more convenient (for example, more easily differentiated). Each of the formulæ above may be restated in their continuous equivalents. For example, the present value at time 0 of a future payment at time '''t''' can be restated in the following way, where '''[[E (mathematical constant)|e]]''' is the base of the [[natural logarithm]] and '''r''' is the continuously compounded rate:
:&lt;math&gt; \text{PV}  = \text{FV}\cdot e^{-rt} &lt;/math&gt;
This can be generalized to discount rates that vary over time: instead of a constant discount rate ''r,'' one uses a function of time ''r''(''t''). In that case the discount factor, and thus the present value, of a cash flow at time ''T'' is given by the [[integral]] of the continuously compounded rate ''r''(''t''):
:&lt;math&gt; \text{PV}  = \text{FV}\cdot \exp\left(-\int_0^T r(t)\,dt\right)&lt;/math&gt;
Indeed, a key reason for using continuous compounding is to simplify the analysis of varying discount rates and to allow one to use the tools of calculus. Further, for interest accrued and capitalized overnight (hence compounded daily), continuous compounding is a close approximation for the actual daily compounding. More sophisticated analysis includes the use of [[#Differential equations|differential equations]], as detailed below.

===Examples===
Using continuous compounding yields the following formulas for various instruments:
;Annuity:
:&lt;math&gt; \ PV \ = \ {A(1-e^{-rt}) \over e^r -1}&lt;/math&gt;
;Perpetuity:
:&lt;math&gt; \ PV  \ = \  {A \over e^r - 1} &lt;/math&gt;
;Growing annuity:
:&lt;math&gt; \ PV  \ = \  {Ae^{-g}(1-e^{-(r-g)t}) \over ^{(r-g)} - 1} &lt;/math&gt;
;Growing perpetuity:
:&lt;math&gt; \ PV  \ = \  {Ae^{-g} \over e^{(r-g)} - 1} &lt;/math&gt;
;Annuity with continuous payments:
:&lt;math&gt; \ PV  \ = \  { 1 - e^{(-rt)} \over r } &lt;/math&gt;
These formulas assume that payment A is made in the first payment period and annuity ends at time t.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://baselineeducation.blogspot.co.uk/2012/10/annuities-and-perpetuities-with.html|title=Annuities and perpetuities with continuous compounding|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differential equations==
[[Ordinary differential equation|Ordinary]] and [[partial differential equation|partial]] [[differential equation]]s (ODEs and PDEs) – equations involving derivatives and one (respectively, multiple) variables are ubiquitous in more advanced treatments of [[financial mathematics]]. While time value of money can be understood without using the framework of differential equations, the added sophistication sheds additional light on time value, and provides a simple introduction before considering more complicated and less familiar situations. This exposition follows {{Harv|Carr|Flesaker|2006|loc = pp. 6–7}}.

The fundamental change that the differential equation perspective brings is that, rather than computing a ''number'' (the present value ''now''), one computes a ''function'' (the present value now or at any point in ''future''). This function may then be analyzed—how does its value change over time—or compared with other functions.

Formally, the statement that "value decreases over time" is given by defining the [[linear differential operator]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt; as:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L} := -\partial_t + r(t).&lt;/math&gt;
This states that values decreases (−) over time (∂&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;) at the discount rate (''r''(''t'')). Applied to a function it yields:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L} f = -\partial_t f(t) + r(t) f(t).&lt;/math&gt;
For an instrument whose payment stream is described by ''f''(''t''), the value ''V''(''t'') satisfies the [[inhomogeneous differential equation|inhomogeneous]] [[first-order differential equation|first-order ODE]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}V = f&lt;/math&gt; ("inhomogeneous" is because one has ''f'' rather than 0, and "first-order" is because one has first derivatives but no higher derivatives) – this encodes the fact that when any cash flow occurs, the value of the instrument changes by the value of the cash flow (if you receive a £10 coupon, the remaining value decreases by exactly £10).

The standard technique tool in the analysis of ODEs is [[Green's function]]s, from which other solutions can be built. In terms of time value of money, the Green's function (for the time value ODE) is the value of a bond paying £1 at a single point in time ''u'' – the value of any other stream of cash flows can then be obtained by taking combinations of this basic cash flow. In mathematical terms, this instantaneous cash flow is modeled as a [[Dirac delta function]] &lt;math&gt;\delta_u(t) := \delta(t-u).&lt;/math&gt;

The Green's function for the value at time ''t'' of a £1 cash flow at time ''u'' is
:&lt;math&gt;b(t;u) := H(u-t)\cdot \exp\left(-\int_t^u r(v)\,dv\right)&lt;/math&gt;
where ''H'' is the [[Heaviside step function]] – the notation "&lt;math&gt;;u&lt;/math&gt;" is to emphasize that ''u'' is a ''parameter'' (fixed in any instance—the time when the cash flow will occur), while ''t'' is a ''variable'' (time). In other words, future cash flows are exponentially discounted (exp) by the sum (integral, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\int}&lt;/math&gt;) of the future discount rates (&lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\int_t^u}&lt;/math&gt; for future, ''r''(''v'') for discount rates), while past cash flows are worth 0 (&lt;math&gt;H(u-t) = 1 \text{ if } t &lt; u, 0 \text{ if } t &gt; u&lt;/math&gt;), because they have already occurred. Note that the value ''at'' the moment of a cash flow is not well-defined – there is a discontinuity at that point, and one can use a convention (assume cash flows have already occurred, or not already occurred), or simply not define the value at that point.

In case the discount rate is constant, &lt;math&gt;r(v) \equiv r,&lt;/math&gt; this simplifies to
:&lt;math&gt;b(t;u) = H(u-t)\cdot e^{-(u-t)r} = \begin{cases} e^{-(u-t) r} &amp; t &lt; u\\ 0 &amp; t &gt; u,\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;(u-t)&lt;/math&gt; is "time remaining until cash flow".

Thus for a stream of cash flows ''f''(''u'') ending by time ''T'' (which can be set to &lt;math&gt;T = +\infty&lt;/math&gt; for no time horizon) the value at time ''t,'' &lt;math&gt;V(t;T)&lt;/math&gt; is given by combining the values of these individual cash flows:
:&lt;math&gt;V(t;T) = \int_t^T f(u) b(t;u)\,du.&lt;/math&gt;
This formalizes time value of money to future values of cash flows with varying discount rates, and is the basis of many formulas in financial mathematics, such as the [[Black–Scholes formula]] with [[Black–Scholes#Interest rate curve|varying interest rates]].

'''Vis5D''' is a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[Scientific visualization|visualization system]] used primarily for animated 3D visualization of [[Numerical weather prediction|weather simulations]]. It was the first system to produce fully interactive animated 3D displays of time-dynamic volumetric data sets&lt;ref name=ecmwf/&gt;&lt;ref name=video/&gt; and the first open source 3D visualization system.&lt;ref name=ieee/&gt; It is GNU GPL licensed.&lt;ref&gt;http://vis5d.sourceforge.net/doc/license.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
Vis5D was created in response to two circumstances:
:1. Output data from weather models and similar simulations are sampled on time sequences of regular 3D grids and are relatively straightforward to visualize.
:2. The appearance in 1988 of commercial workstations such as the [[Stardent|Stellar]] [[GS workstation|GS 1000]] capable of rendering [[Gouraud-shaded]] 3D graphics fast enough for smooth [[animation]].

Vis5D takes its name from its 5D array containing time sequences of 3D spatial grids for a set of physical parameters of the atmosphere or ocean. Its [[graphical user interface]] enables users to select from various ways of visualizing each parameter (e.g., [[ISO surface|iso-surfaces]], plane slices, [[volume rendering]]s), and to select a combination of parameters for view. A key innovation of Vis5D is that it computes and stores the geometries and colors for such graphics over the simulated time sequence, allowing them to be animated quickly so users can watch movies of their simulations.&lt;ref name=ieee/&gt; Furthermore, users can interactively rotate the animations in 3D.

Vis5D provides other visualization techniques. Users can drag a 3D cursor to a selected time and location, then trigger the calculation of a forward and backward wind trajectory from that point. Users can drag a vertical bar cursor and see, in another window, a thermodynamic diagram for the selected vertical column of atmosphere. And users can drag a 3D cursor to a selected time and location and read out individual values for parameters at that point. These examples all involve [[direct manipulation interface]]s, as does the placement of plane slices through 3D grids.

Vis5D provides options for memory management, so that very large data sets can be visualized at individual time steps without the need to compute graphics over the simulation's entire time sequence, while smaller data sets can be visualized with full animation. Vis5D also provides an [[API]] enabling developers of other systems to incorporate Vis5D's functionality. This API is the basis of a [[Tcl|TCL]] scripting capability so users can write automated scripts for producing animations.

==History==
Vis5D was first demonstrated, via videotape, at the December 1988 Workshop on Graphics in Meteorology at the [[ECMWF]].&lt;ref name=ecmwf&gt;ECMWF Workshop, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; The first live demos were at the January 1989 annual meeting of the [[American Meteorological Society]].

Vis5D running on the GS 1000 was the first visualization system to provide smooth animation of 3D gridded time-sequence data sets with interactive rotation.&lt;ref name=ecmwf/&gt;&lt;ref name=video&gt;Siggraph Video Review 43, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

Vis5D was the first [[open-source software|open-source]] 3D visualization system.&lt;ref name=ieee&gt;IEEE Visualization 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

Vis5D is a natural for [[Immersion (virtual reality)|immersive]] [[virtual reality]] and was adapted to the [[Cave Automatic Virtual Environment|CAVE]] for the VROOM at the 1994 [[Siggraph]] conference.&lt;ref name=cave5d&gt;Hibbard et al, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; This became [[Cave5D]].
