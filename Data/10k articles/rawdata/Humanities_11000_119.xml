The '''1974 anti-American riots in Cyprus''' were violent [[anti-American]] rioting that took place in front of the [[United States]] embassy in [[Nicosia]], [[Cyprus]] on August 19, 1974. The events took place days after the second phase of the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]] which resulted in [[Turkey]] controlling 40% of the island.

Hundreds of [[Greek-Cypriot]]s who were frustrated at the failure of the United States to quell the Turkish forces and fearing its alleging support for Turkey started to protest and riot. Many of those who took part were leftists.

The American ambassador to Cyprus, [[Rodger Davies]], who was seeking shelter inside the embassy, was shot and killed by sharpshooters belonging to [[EOKA-B]], a Greek-Cypriot nationalist paramilitary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aVcG7EkuPgAC&amp;pg=PA165&amp;lpg=PA165&amp;dq=august+1974+riots+cyprus+embassy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=iiAY2OFwZE&amp;sig=ZJPtVOx2n2Pz-wj4QwGVTmEqq6g&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjW-6m2u5zcAhWOM-wKHcTkBpUQ6AEIdDAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=august%201974%20riots%20cyprus%20embassy&amp;f=false |title=Historical Dictionary of Terrorism - Stephen Sloan, Sean K.

'''''A Satyr Against Reason and Mankind''''' is a [[satirical]] [[poem]] by the English [[Restoration literature|Restoration]] poet [[John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester]].

==Interpretation==
''A Satyr Against Reason and Mankind'' addresses the question of the proper use of [[reason]], and is generally assumed to be a [[Hobbesian]] critique of [[rationalism]].&lt;ref name=Fisher /&gt; The narrator subordinates reason to sense.&lt;ref name="Jenkinson101"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jenkinson|first=Matthew|title=Culture and Politics at the Court of Charles II, 1660–1685|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8-sGu6QN_CcC&amp;pg=PA99|year=2010|publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer|isbn=978-1-84383-590-5|page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is based to some extent on [[Nicolas Boileau-Despréaux|Boileau]]'s version of [[Juvenal]]'s eighth or fifteenth satire, and is also indebted to Hobbes, [[Montaigne]], [[Lucretius]] and [[Epicurus]], as well as the general [[libertine]] tradition.&lt;ref name="Jenkinson2010" /&gt; Confusion has arisen in its interpretation as it is ambiguous as to whether the speaker is Rochester himself, or a satirised persona.&lt;ref name="Thormählen1993"&gt;{{cite book|last=Thormählen|first=Marianne|title=Rochester|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cxLBy2XR_H0C&amp;pg=PA190|accessdate=4 April 2013|date=25 June 1993|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-44042-4|page=191}}&lt;/ref&gt; It criticises the vanities and corruptions of the statesmen and politicians of the court of Charles II.&lt;ref name="Jenkinson2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jenkinson|first=Matthew|title=Culture and Politics at the Court of Charles II: 1660–1685|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8-sGu6QN_CcC&amp;pg=PA99|accessdate=4 April 2013|year=2010|publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer|isbn=978-1-84383-590-5|page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
It is generally supposed to have been written before June 1674, which is the dating of the earliest surviving manuscript.&lt;ref name=Fisher&gt;{{cite web|last=Fisher|first=Nicholas|title=The Contemporary Reception of Rochester's A Satyr against Mankind|url=http://res.oxfordjournals.org/content/57/229/185.full.pdf+html|publisher=''[[The Review of English Studies]]'' (April 2006) 57 (229): 185–220. doi: 10.1093/res/hgl035}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with ''A Ramble in St. James's Park'', it is one of Rochester's best known works, and his most influential during his lifetime.&lt;ref name=Fisher /&gt; It exists in some 52 manuscripts, more than any other work by the poet.&lt;ref name=Fisher /&gt;

It resulted in four direct poetic responses; [[Edward Pococke]]'s ''An Answer to the Satyr against Mankind'', Thomas Lessey's ''A Satyr In Answer to the Satyr against Man'', and the two anonymous responses ''An answer to a Satyr [against] Reason &amp; Mankind'' and ''An Answer to the Satyr, Against Man''.&lt;ref name=Fisher /&gt; It is alluded to in [[John Crowne]]'s ''The Country Wit''.&lt;ref name=Fisher /&gt; It has been argued that [[John Dryden]] addressed the poem in
''[[Religio Laici]]''.&lt;ref name=Fisher /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4929">{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Arcades'' (Milton)}}
'''''Arcades''''' is a [[masque]] written by [[John Milton]] and performed on 4 May 1634. The piece was written to celebrate the character of [[Alice Spencer]], the Countess Dowager of Derby, widow of [[Ferdinando Stanley, 5th Earl of Derby]], during her 75th birthday. The masque distinguishes Spencer as having a greater far superior to other noble women by titling Spencer as queen of a metaphorical [[Arcadia]] that is far superior to any other realm. The piece served as a basis for Milton's later masque, ''[[Comus (John Milton)|Comus]]''. 

==Background==
Spencer's family invited Milton to write a masque for a celebration to honour her on her 75th birthday, 4 May 1634. This arrangement was made possible through the intervention of [[Henry Lawes]], the Earl's music tutor for his children,&lt;ref&gt;Shawcross 1993 p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; and friend to Milton's father.&lt;ref&gt;Lewalski 2003 p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Milton wrote ''Arcades'' and the piece was performed at the Harefield estate. This masque established many themes and ideas later developed in his other masque, ''[[Comus (masque)|Comus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Lewalski 2003 pp. 7–8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Masque==
The masque begins by praising the countess and describes her in royal terms during the first song:&lt;ref name="Lewalski p. 8"&gt;Lewalski 2003 p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;
:Mark what radiant state she spreads,
:In circle round her shining throne
:Shooting her beams like silver threads:
:this, this is she alone,
:Sitting like a goddess bright,
:In the center of her light (lines 14–19)
Genius continues this idea and emphasizes that she was:&lt;ref name="Lewalski p. 8"/&gt;
:the great mistress of yong princely shrine,
:Whom with low reverence I adore as mine, (lines 36–37)

According to Genius, sirens, similar to the muses, create a music that fills the senses:&lt;ref name="Revard p. 144"&gt;Revard 1997 p. 144&lt;/ref&gt;
:But else in deep of night when drowsiness
:Hath locked up mortal sense, then listen I
:To the celestial sirens' harmony (lines 61–63)
Genius describes how he, unlike mortals, is able to hear the song of the sirens and the song compelled him to an innocent rapture&lt;ref name="Revard p. 144"/&gt; along with the Fates who are also seduced by the siren song:&lt;ref&gt;Carey 1990 p. 257&lt;/ref&gt;
:Such sweet compulsion doth in music lie,
:To lull the daughters of Necessity,
:And keep unsteady Nature to her law,
:and the low world in measured motion draw
:After the heavenly tune, which none can hear
:Of human mold with gross unpurged ear;
:And yet such music worthiest were to blaze
:The peerless height of her immortal praise, (lines 68–75)

Her magnificence is further distinguished from any others during the second song:&lt;ref name="Lewalski p. 8"/&gt;
:Such a rural queen
:All Arcadia hath not seen. (lines 94–95)
This is compounded by the third song declaring that other queens are below her status and concluding the masque:&lt;ref name="Lewalski p. 8"/&gt;
:Here ye shall have greater grace,
:To serve the Lady of this place.
:Though Syrinx your Pan's mistress were,
:Yet Syrinx well might wait on her.
:Such a rural queen
:All Arcadia hath not seen. (lines 104–109)

==Themes==
''Arcades'' sought to draw upon pastoral elements and mocked the pastoral [[Charles I of England|Caroline traditions]] of [[Henrietta Maria of France]]. Instead of following traditional themes inherent in the genre that welcome guests, the guest characters in the masque seek to praise the Countess who is guided by the spirit Genius.&lt;ref&gt;Lewalski 2003 p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Genius is not a unique figure in Miltonic poetry and he is similar to a demon or Thyrsis in ''Comus'' because he relies on divine music for an earthly purpose.&lt;ref name="Revard p. 144"/&gt; 

The masque portrays a powerful female character at the centre of the plot. Although he does not say that she is part of the surrounding social context, especially one that could be seen in a negative light, she does have direct connections to classical female divinities, such as [[Cybele]] and [[Leto|Latona]], who have established divine families. The female figure is not only a mother of her family; she is also mother of a greater version of Arcady. In her position, the people and spirits of the land honour her for her greatness.&lt;ref&gt;Revard 1997 pp. 154–155&lt;/ref&gt;

''American Psychologist'' (32)88-89&lt;/ref&gt; The test is formatted with 60 different [[Trait theory|personality traits]] which participants rate themselves based on a 7-point [[Likert scale]]. Traits are evenly dispersed, 20 masculine, 20 feminine, and 20 filler traits thought to be gender neutral.&lt;ref name="Bem"&gt;Bem &amp; Sandra Lipsitz (1981) "Bem Sex-Role Inventory" ''Mental Measurements Yearbook with Tests in Print'', (9)&lt;/ref&gt; All traits in the BSRI are positively valued personality aspects.&lt;ref name="Lee"&gt;Lee, Aldora (1982) "Psychological Androgyny and Social Desirability" ''Journal of Personality Assessment'', (46)147&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous past studies have found that gender categorizations are [[Correlation and dependence|correlated]] with many stereotypical gendered behaviors.&lt;ref name="Bem"/&gt;

==History==
"In the field of psychology, much research is conducted involving individuals' perceptions of gender roles, and behavioral as well as attitudinal correlates.  Gender roles may be defined as "expectations about what is appropriate behavior for each sex".  One can also add to this definition the expectations which are held about appropriate personality characteristics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Cheryl L. Holt|author2=Jon. B. Ellis |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1018836923919#page-2 |title=Assessing the Current Validity of the Bem Sex-Role Inventory  |date=1998-12-01 |accessdate=2013-11-01 |doi=10.1023/A:1018836923919 |volume=39 |journal=Sex Roles |pages=929–941}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bem Sex-Role Inventory was created by [[Sandra Bem]] in an effort to measure androgyny. It was published in 1974. Stereotypical masculine and feminine traits were found by surveying 100 Stanford undergraduate students on which traits they found to be socially desirable for each sex.&lt;ref name="Bem" /&gt; The original list of 200 traits was narrowed down to the 40 masculine and feminine traits that appear on the present test.&lt;ref name="Gaa"&gt;Gaa, John P. &amp; Liberman, Dov. (1980) "Response Tendency on the Bem Sex-Role Inventory." ''The Journal of Psychology''. (2)259&lt;/ref&gt; Normative data was found from a 1973 sample for 444 males and 279 females and a 1978 sample of 340 females and 476 males all also from [[Stanford University]] undergraduates.&lt;ref name="Bem"/&gt;

==Scoring and interpretation==
Participants are asked to rate themselves on each trait using a Likert scale. One indicates never or almost never true, while a seven would indicate always or almost always true.&lt;ref name="Gaa"/&gt; Originally androgyny was calculated by finding the [[T-statistic|t-ratio]] difference between masculine and feminine scores; however, in 1981 Bem advises users to utilize a split [[median]] technique for more accurate scoring.&lt;ref name="Bem"/&gt;

The Bem Sex-Role Inventory offers four different possible resulting categorizations: masculine, feminine, androgynous and undifferentiated. Previously, an androgynous score was thought to be the result of equal masculine and feminine traits, while a sex-typed masculine or feminine score is the result of more traits belonging in one or the other category.The fourth type of score, undifferentiated, was seen as the result of extremely low masculine and feminine traits.

However, after the change in scoring technique, androgynous is the result of scoring above the median in both masculine and feminine categories. Sex-typed scores, masculine and feminine, are the result of scoring above the median in one gender and below the median in the other. An undifferentiated score is now a result of scoring below the median in both masculine and feminine categories. In other words, since scores are based on normative data, an androgynous classification occurs when a subject scores above 50% of the comparison group in both masculine and feminine categories, while a sex-typed classification is the result of scoring above half the comparison group in only one gender category.&lt;ref name="Sedney"&gt;Sedney, Mars Anne (1981) "Comments on Median Split Procedures for Scoring Androgyny Measures." ''Sex Roles'' (7)217&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reliability and validity==
The BSRI is very empirically sound. Bem reports [[Cronbach's alpha|coefficient alphas]] of .78 for femininity scales and .87 for the masculinity scale. BSRI, also has demonstrated high [[Repeatability|test-retest reliability]].&lt;ref name="Bem"/&gt;

However, since this is a [[self-report inventory]], how reliable the assessment is depends on how accurately participants rate themselves. An androgynous score is the result of extremely masculine and feminine scores and an undifferentiated score is the result of extremely low masculine and feminine scores. It has been theorized that perhaps tendencies to rate oneself extremely low and extremely high on traits can affect a subjects' resulting gender placement.&lt;ref name="Gaa"/&gt;

The degree of [[Reliability (psychometrics)|reliability]] of each scoring technique is up for debate. When comparing the old t ratio scoring to the newly endorsed median split technique, 42.3% of participants had a different resulting categorization. Since the median split method bases scores more heavily on the normative data of that population, a participant can be categorized differently based on the population of subjects they take the test with. For example, results may differ if the test was administered to a group of marines versus students at a private girls highschool. This challenges the test's between sample reliability.&lt;ref name="Sedney"/&gt; As stated by Elazae Pedhazur in a clip from his critique, "Bem concludes her discussion by stating, 'Finally, we urge investigators to further analyze their data without categorizing individual subjects in any way, i.e., through the use of multiple regression technique.' While endorsing what appears to be a suggestion to conduct studies within the framework of trait-treatment interactions, one cannot help wondering: Where has androgyny gone?"&lt;ref&gt;Pedhazur, Elazae. "Bem Sex Role Inventory: A Theoretical and Methodological Critique." Journal of Personality and Social Psychology (1979): 996-1016. EBSCOhost. Web. 13 Oct. 2013. &lt;http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?vid=3&amp;sid=ca8d7727-86ea-47e2-a191-8f083f23dcd3%40sessionmgr111&amp;hid=103&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=pdh&amp;AN=1980-29271-001&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bem Sex-Role Inventory (short form)==
The short form of the BSRI consists of 30 items. It has a strong .90 correlation with the original BSRI. This short form of the test allows for increased [[internal consistency]]. Bem reports similar masculinity coefficient alphas and higher femininity coefficient alphas with this form. The short form discards the traits "feminine", "masculine", and "athletic" from the self-report scales. Specifically, the short form removed some feminine traits that could be seen as less socially desirable such as "gullible" and "childlike". Masculine categories depict "assertive-dominance" and "instrumentality", while feminine categories depict "nurtureness-interpersonal warmth" and "expressiveness".&lt;ref name="Bem"/&gt;

{{legal status}}
'''Citizenship''' is the status of a person recognized under the [[custom (law)|custom]] or [[law]] as being a legal member of a [[sovereign state]] or belonging to a [[nation]].

A person may have [[multiple citizenship]]s. A person who does not have citizenship of any state is said to be [[Stateless person|stateless]], while one who lives on state borders whose territorial status is uncertain is a border-lander.&lt;ref&gt;Coplan, David. "Introduction: From empiricism to theory in African border studies." Journal of Borderlands Studies 25.2 (2010): 1-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nationality]] is often used as a synonym for citizenship in English&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pitt.edu/~votruba/qsonhist/slovaknationalityethnicityenglishtranslation.html | title = Nationality, ethnicity in Slovakia. | last = Votruba | first = Martin | work = Slovak Studies Program | publisher = University of Pittsburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt; – notably in [[public international law|international law]] – although the term is sometimes understood as denoting a person's membership of a [[nation]] (a large [[Ethnicity|ethnic group]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Nationality and Statelessness in International Law |first1=Paul |last1=Weis |isbn=9789028603295 |year=1979 |publisher=Sijthoff &amp; Noordhoff |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=hSLGDXqXeegC&amp;pg=PA3 3]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries, e.g. the [[Citizenship of the United States#Citizenship vs. nationality|United States]], [[British nationality law#Classes of British nationality|the United Kingdom]], nationality and citizenship can have different meanings (for more information, see [[Nationality#Nationality versus citizenship|Nationality versus citizenship]]).

==Determining factors==
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2013}}
{{further information|Nationality law}}
Each country has its own policies, regulations and criteria as to who is entitled to its citizenship. A person can be recognized or granted citizenship on a number of bases. Usually citizenship based on circumstances of birth is automatic, but in other cases an application may be required.

* Citizenship by birth (''[[jus sanguinis]]''). If one or both of a person's parents are citizens of a given state, then the person may have the right to be a citizen of that state as well.{{efn|Examples: [[Philippine nationality law#Citizenship by birth|Philippines]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chanrobles.com/article4.htm Article IV of the Philippine Constitution].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Title 8 of the United States Code|United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/chapter-12/subchapter-III/part-I 8 USC Part I - Nationality at Birth and Collective Naturalization8 USC Part I - Nationality at Birth and Collective Naturalization]&lt;/ref&gt;}} Formerly this might only have applied through the paternal line, but [[sex equality]] became common since the late twentieth century. Citizenship is granted based on ancestry or [[ethnicity]] and is related to the concept of a [[nation state]] common in Europe. Where ''jus sanguinis'' holds, a person born outside a country, one or both of whose parents are citizens of the country, is also a citizen. States normally{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} limit the right to citizenship by descent to a certain number of generations born outside the state, although some do not.{{clarify|date=October 2013}} This form of citizenship is common in [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] countries.
* Born within a country (''[[jus soli]]''). Some people are automatically citizens of the state in which they are born. This form of citizenship originated in [[England]] where those who were born within the realm were [[British subject#Prior to 1949|subjects of the monarch]] (a concept pre-dating citizenship) and is common in [[common law]] countries.
** In many cases, both ''jus soli'' and ''jus sanguinis'' hold citizenship either by place or parentage (or both).
* Citizenship by marriage (''[[jus matrimonii]]''). Many countries fast-track naturalization based on the marriage of a person to a citizen. Countries which are destinations for such immigration often have regulations to try to detect [[sham marriage]]s, where a citizen marries a non-citizen typically for payment, without them having the intention of living together.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/media-centre/news/sham-marriage-bishops UK government Web site: Bishops act to tackle sham marriages - New UK Border Agency approved guidance for clergy should help prevent weddings for visas, 11 April 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Naturalization]]. States normally grant citizenship to people who have entered the country legally and been granted permit to stay, or been granted [[political asylum]], and also lived there for a specified period. In some countries, naturalization is subject to conditions which may include passing a test demonstrating reasonable knowledge of the language or way of life of the host country, good conduct (no serious criminal record) and moral character (such as drunkenness, or gambling), vowing allegiance to their new state or its ruler and renouncing their prior citizenship. Some states allow [[dual citizenship]] and do not require naturalized citizens to formally renounce any other citizenship.
* Citizenship by investment or [[Economic Citizenship]]. Wealthy people invest money in property or businesses, buy government bonds or simply donate cash directly, in exchange for citizenship and a passport. Whilst legitimate and usually limited in quota, the schemes are controversial. Costs for citizenship by investment range from as little as $100,000 (£74,900) to as much as €2.5m (£2.19m)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Citizenship for sale: how tycoons can go shopping for a new passport |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/02/citizenship-by-investment-passport-super-rich-nationality |website=The Guardian |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Excluded categories. In the past there have been exclusions on entitlement to citizenship on grounds such as skin color, ethnicity, sex, and free status (not being a [[slave]]). Most of these exclusions no longer apply in most places. Modern examples include some [[Arab countries]] which rarely grant citizenship to non-Muslims, e.g. [[Qatar]] is known for granting citizenship to foreign athletes, but they all have to profess the [[Islamic]] faith in order to receive citizenship. The United States grants citizenship to those born as a result of reproductive technologies, and internationally adopted children born after February 27, 1983. Some exclusions still persist for internationally adopted children born before February 27, 1983 even though their parents meet citizenship criteria.

===Polis===
{{Main article|Polis}}
Many thinkers point to the concept of citizenship beginning in the early [[city-state]]s of [[ancient Greece]], although others see it as primarily a modern phenomenon dating back only a few hundred years and, for humanity, that the concept of citizenship arose with the first [[law]]s. ''Polis'' meant both the political assembly of the city-state as well as the entire society.{{sfn|Pocock|1998|p=32}} Citizenship has generally been identified as a western phenomenon.{{sfn|Zarrow|1997|p=4}} There is a general view that citizenship in ancient times was a simpler relation than modern forms of citizenship, although this view has come under scrutiny.&lt;ref name="tws2Y17"/&gt; The relation of citizenship has not been a fixed or static relation, but constantly changed within each society, and that according to one view, citizenship might "really have worked" only at select periods during certain times, such as when the Athenian politician [[Solon]] made reforms in the early Athenian state.&lt;ref name=tws2Y12&gt;{{Cite book

Historian [[Geoffrey Hosking]] in his 2005 ''Modern Scholar'' lecture course suggested that citizenship in [[ancient Greece]] arose from an appreciation for the importance of [[Political freedom|freedom]].&lt;ref name=twsfjiui&gt;{{Cite book

{{Quote|It can be argued that this growth of slavery was what made Greeks particularly conscious of the value of freedom. After all, any Greek farmer might fall into debt and therefore might become a slave, at almost any time ... When the Greeks fought together, they fought in order to avoid being enslaved by warfare, to avoid being defeated by those who might take them into slavery. And they also arranged their political institutions so as to remain free men.|Geoffrey Hosking, 2005&lt;ref name=twsfjiui/&gt;}}

[[File:Arte greca, pietra tombale di donna con la sua assistente, 100 ac. circa.JPG|thumb|right|Geoffrey Hosking suggests that fear of being enslaved was a central motivating force for the development of the Greek sense of citizenship. Sculpture: a Greek woman being served by a slave-child.]]
Slavery permitted slaveowners to have substantial free time, and enabled participation in public life.&lt;ref name=twsfjiui/&gt; Polis citizenship was marked by exclusivity. Inequality of status was widespread; citizens (πολίτης ''politēs'' &lt; πόλις 'city') had a higher status than non-citizens, such as women, slaves, and resident foreigners ([[metic]]s).&lt;ref name=tws2Y16/&gt;{{sfn|Pocock|1998|p=33}} The first form of citizenship was based on the way people lived in the [[ancient Greek]] times, in small-scale organic communities of the polis. Citizenship was not seen as a separate activity from the private life of the individual person, in the sense that there was not a distinction between [[public sphere|public]] and [[Private sphere|private]] life. The obligations of citizenship were deeply connected into one's everyday life in the polis. These small-scale organic communities were generally seen as a new development in world history, in contrast to the established ancient civilizations of Egypt or Persia, or the hunter-gatherer bands elsewhere. From the viewpoint of the ancient Greeks, a person's public life was not separated from their private life, and Greeks did not distinguish between the two worlds according to the modern western conception. The obligations of citizenship were deeply connected with everyday life. To be truly human, one had to be an active citizen to the community, which Aristotle famously expressed: "To take no part in the running of the community's affairs is to be either a beast or a god!" This form of citizenship was based on obligations of citizens towards the community, rather than rights given to the citizens of the community. This was not a problem because they all had a strong affinity with the polis; their own destiny and the destiny of the community were strongly linked. Also, citizens of the polis saw obligations to the community as an opportunity to be virtuous, it was a source of honour and respect. In Athens, citizens were both ruler and ruled, important political and judicial offices were rotated and all citizens had the right to speak and vote in the political assembly.

===Roman ideas===
In the [[Roman Empire]], citizenship expanded from small-scale communities to the entire empire. Romans realized that granting citizenship to people from all over the empire legitimized Roman rule over conquered areas. Roman citizenship was no longer a status of political agency, as it had been reduced to a judicial safeguard and the expression of rule and law.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Civis romanus sum]].&lt;/ref&gt; Rome carried forth Greek ideas of citizenship such as the principles of [[equality under the law]], civic participation in government, and notions that "no one citizen should have too much power for too long",&lt;ref name=twsffujfk&gt;{{Cite book

One historian explained:

{{Quote|The person was defined and represented through his actions upon things; in the course of time, the term property came to mean, first, the defining characteristic of a human or other being; second, the relation which a person had with a thing; and third, the thing defined as the possession of some person.|[[J. G. A. Pocock]], 1998{{sfn|Pocock|1998|p=36}}}}

Roman citizenship reflected a struggle between the upper-class [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] interests against the lower-order working groups known as the [[plebs|plebeian]] class.&lt;ref name=twsffujfk/&gt; A citizen came to be understood as a person "free to act by law, free to ask and expect the law's protection, a citizen of such and such a legal community, of such and such a legal standing in that community".{{sfn|Pocock|1998|p=37}} Citizenship meant having rights to have possessions, immunities, expectations, which were "available in many kinds and degrees, available or unavailable to many kinds of person for many kinds of reason".{{sfn|Pocock|1998|p=37}} The law itself was a kind of bond uniting people.{{sfn|Pocock|1998|p=38}} Roman citizenship was more impersonal, universal, multiform, having different degrees and applications.{{sfn|Pocock|1998|p=38}}

===Middle Ages===
During the European [[Middle Ages]], citizenship was usually associated with cities and towns, and applied mainly to middle class folk. Titles such as [[Burgher (title)|burgher]], [[grand burgher]] (German ''Großbürger'') and [[bourgeoisie]] denoted political affiliation and identity in relation to a particular locality, as well as membership in a mercantile or trading class; thus, individuals of respectable means and socioeconomic status were interchangeable with citizens.

During this era, members of the [[nobility]] had a range of [[Privilege (legal ethics)|privilege]]s above [[commoner]]s (see [[aristocracy]]), though political upheavals and reforms, beginning most prominently with the [[French Revolution]], abolished privileges and created an egalitarian concept of citizenship.

===Renaissance===
 &lt;!-- linked from redirect [[Subject (monarchy)]] --&gt;
{{anchor|Subject}}
During the [[Renaissance]], people transitioned from being subjects of a king or queen to being citizens of a city and later to a nation.&lt;ref name=tws2Y14/&gt;{{rp|p.161}} Each city had its own law, courts, and independent administration.{{sfn|Weber|1998|p=44}} And being a citizen often meant being subject to the city's law in addition to having power in some instances to help choose officials.{{sfn|Weber|1998|p=44}} City dwellers who had fought alongside nobles in battles to defend their cities were no longer content with having a subordinate social status, but demanded a greater role in the form of citizenship.{{sfn|Weber|1998|p=46}} Membership in [[guild]]s was an indirect form of citizenship in that it helped their members succeed financially.{{sfn|Weber|1998|pp=46-47}} The rise of citizenship was linked to the rise of republicanism, according to one account, since independent citizens meant that kings had less power.{{sfn|Zarrow|1997|p=3}} Citizenship became an idealized, almost abstract, concept,&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt; and did not signify a submissive relation with a lord or count, but rather indicated the bond between a person and the state in the rather abstract sense of having [[rights]] and duties.&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt;

===Modern times===
The modern idea of citizenship still respects the idea of political participation, but it is usually done through "elaborate systems of political representation at a distance" such as [[representative democracy]].&lt;ref name=tws2Y17/&gt; Modern citizenship is much more passive; action is delegated to others; citizenship is often a constraint on acting, not an impetus to act.&lt;ref name=tws2Y17/&gt; Nevertheless, citizens are usually aware of their obligations to authorities, and are aware that these bonds often limit what they can do.&lt;ref name=tws2Y17/&gt;

====United States====
[[File:DredScott.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Dred Scott, plaintiff in the infamous ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'' case at the Supreme Court of the United States, commissioned by a "group of Negro citizens" and presented to the Missouri Historical Society, St. Louis, in 1888]]
From 1790 until the mid-twentieth century, United States law used racial criteria to establish citizenship rights and regulate who was eligible to become a naturalized citizen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997/jul/04/news/mn-9708|title=A History of U.S. Citizenship|last=|first=|date=July 4, 1997|website=The Los Angeles Times|publisher=|access-date=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Naturalization Act of 1790|The Naturalization Act of 1790]], the first law in U.S. history to establish rules for citizenship and naturalization, barred citizenship to all people who were not of European descent, stating that "any alien being a free white person, who shall have resided within the limits and under the jurisdiction of the United States for the term of two years, may be admitted to become a citizen thereof."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rs6.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&amp;fileName=001/llsl001.db&amp;recNum=226|title=A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation: U.S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774 - 1875|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=The Library of Congress|access-date=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under early U.S. laws, African Americans were not eligible for citizenship. In 1857, these laws were upheld in the US Supreme Court case [[Dred Scott v. Sandford]], which ruled that "a free negro of the African race, whose ancestors were brought to this country and sold as slaves, is not a 'citizen' within the meaning of the Constitution of the United States," and that "the special rights and immunities guarantied to citizens do not apply to them."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/60/393#writing-USSC_CR_0060_0393_ZO|title=Scott v. Sandford|last=|first=|date=1857|website=Legal Information Institute|publisher=Cornell University Law School|access-date=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not until the abolition of slavery following the [[American Civil War]] that African Americans were granted citizenship rights. [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|The 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution]], ratified on July 9, 1868, stated that "all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_amendments_11-27.html|title=Constitution of the United States: Amendment XIV|last=|first=|date=1868|website=The Charters of Freedom|publisher=U.S. National Archives and Records Administration|access-date=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, the [[Naturalization Act of 1870]] would extend the right to become a naturalized citizen to include "aliens of African nativity and to persons of African descent".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Naturalization_Act_of_1870|title=Naturalization Act of 1870|last=|first=|date=|website=Wikisource|publisher=U.S. Congress|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the gains made by African Americans after the Civil War, Native Americans, Asians, and others not considered "free white persons" were still denied the ability to become citizens. The 1882 [[Chinese Exclusion Act]] explicitly denied naturalization rights to all people of Chinese origin, while subsequent acts passed by the US Congress, such as laws in [[Naturalization Act of 1906|1906]], [[Immigration Act of 1917|1917]], and [[Immigration Act of 1924|1924]], would include clauses that denied immigration and naturalization rights to people based on broadly defined racial categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://library.uwb.edu/static/USimmigration/1917_immigration_act.html|title=1917 Immigration Act|last=|first=|date=|website=US Immigration Legislation Online|publisher=University of Washington-Bothell Library|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supreme Court cases such as [[Ozawa v. United States]] (1922) and [[United States v. Bhagat Singh Thind|U.S. v. Bhagat Singh Thind]] (1923), would later clarify the meaning of the phrase "free white persons," ruling that ethnically Japanese, Indian, and other non-European people were not "white persons", and were therefore ineligible for naturalization under U.S. law.

Native Americans were not granted full US citizenship until the passage of the [[Indian Citizenship Act]] in 1924. However, even well into the 1960s some state laws prevented Native Americans from exercising their full rights as citizens, such as the right to vote. In 1962, New Mexico became the last state to enfranchise Native Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/teachers/classroommaterials/presentationsandactivities/presentations/elections/voters9.html|title=Elections: Native Americans|last=|first=|date=|website=Library of Congress|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not until the passage of the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952]] that the racial and gender restrictions for naturalization were explicitly abolished. However, the act still contained restrictions regarding who was eligible for US citizenship, and retained a national quota system which limited the number of visas given to immigrants based on their national origin, to be fixed "at a rate of one-sixth of one percent of each nationality's population in the United States in 1920".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://history.state.gov/milestones/1945-1952/immigration-act|title=The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (The McCarran-Walter Act)|last=|first=|date=|website=The Office of the Historian|publisher=U.S. Department of State|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until the passage of the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965]] that these immigration quota systems were drastically altered in favor of a less discriminatory system.

The [[Russian Constitution of 1918|1918 constitution of revolutionary Russia]] granted citizenship to any foreigners who were living within Russia, so long as they were "engaged in work and [belonged] to the working class."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/history/ussr/government/constitution/1918/article2.htm|title=1918 Constitution of the Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic.

====National Socialism====

[[National Socialism]] or "Nazism", the German variant of twentieth century fascism whose precepts were laid out in [[Adolf Hitler|Adolf Hitler's]] [[Mein Kampf]], classified inhabitants of the nation into three main hierarchical categories, each of which would have different rights and duties in relation to the state: citizens, subjects, and aliens. The first category, citizens, were to possess full civic rights and responsibilities. Citizenship would be conferred only on males of German (or so-called "Aryan") heritage who had completed military service, and could be revoked at any time by the state. The Reich Citizenship Law of 1935 established [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|racial criteria for citizenship in the German Reich]], and because of this law Jews and others who could not prove "German" racial heritage were stripped of their citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/nurmlaw3.html|title=The Nuremberg Laws: The Reich Citizenship Law (September 15, 1935)|last=|first=|date=|website=Jewish Virtual Library|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second category, subjects, referred to all others who were born within the nation's boundaries who did not fit the racial criteria for citizenship. Subjects would have no voting rights, could not hold any position within the state, and possessed none of the other rights and civic responsibilities conferred on citizens. All women were to be conferred "subject" status upon birth, and could only obtain "citizen" status if they worked independently or if they married a German citizen (see [[women in Nazi Germany]]).

The final category, aliens, referred to those who were citizens of another state, who also had no rights.

{{Quote|text="The People's State will classify its population in three groups: Citizens, subjects of the State, and aliens.

The principle is that birth within the confines of the State gives only the status of a subject. It does not carry with it the right to fill any position under the State or to participate in political life, such as taking an active or passive part in elections. Another principle is that the race and nationality of every subject of the State will have to be proved. A subject is at any time free to cease being a subject and to become a citizen of that country to which he belongs in virtue of his nationality. The only difference between an alien and a subject of the State is that the former is a citizen of another country.

The young boy or girl who is of German nationality and is a subject of the German State is bound to complete the period of school education which is obligatory for every German. Thereby he submits to the system of training which will make him conscious of his race and a member of the folk-community. Then he has to fulfil all those requirements laid down by the State in regard to physical training after he has left school; and finally he enters the army. The training in the army is of a general kind. It must be given to each individual German and will render him competent to fulfil the physical and mental requirements of military service. The rights of citizenship shall be conferred on every young man whose health and character have been certified as good, after having completed his period of military service. This act of inauguration in citizenship shall be a solemn ceremony.

And the diploma conferring the rights of citizenship will be preserved by the young man as the most precious testimonial of his whole life. It entitles him to exercise all the rights of a citizen and to enjoy all the privileges attached thereto. For the State must draw a sharp line of distinction between those who, as members of the nation, are the foundation and the support of its existence and greatness, and those who are domiciled in the State simply as earners of their livelihood there.

On the occasion of conferring a diploma of citizenship the new citizen must take a solemn oath of loyalty to the national community and the State. This diploma must be a bond which unites together all the various classes and sections of the nation. It shall be a greater honour to be a citizen of this Reich, even as a street-sweeper, than to be the King of a foreign State.

The citizen has privileges which are not accorded to the alien. He is the master in the Reich. But this high honour has also its obligations. Those who show themselves without personal honour or character, or common criminals, or traitors to the fatherland, can at any time be deprived of the rights of citizenship. Therewith they become merely subjects of the State.

The German girl is a subject of the State but will become a citizen when she marries. At the same time those women who earn their livelihood independently have the right to acquire citizenship if they are German subjects."|sign=[[Adolf Hitler]]|source=''[[Mein Kampf]]'', Volume II: The National Socialist Movement, Chapter III: Subjects and Citizens}}

==Different senses==
[[File:Citizenship contrasting views.png|thumb|upright=1.8|Many theorists suggest that there are two opposing conceptions of citizenship: an economic one, and a political one. For further information, see [[History of citizenship#Competing senses of citizenship|History of citizenship]].]]
Citizenship status, under [[social contract]] theory, carries with it both [[Social rights (social contract theory)|rights]] and [[duties]]. In this sense, citizenship was described as "a bundle of rights -- primarily, political participation in the life of the community, the right to vote, and the right to receive certain protection from the community, as well as obligations."&lt;ref name=twsJun16&gt;{{cite book|author=Virginia Leary|editors=Alan C.

How citizenship is understood depends on the person making the determination. The relation of citizenship has never been fixed or static, but constantly changes within each society. While citizenship has varied considerably throughout history, and within societies over time, there are some common elements but they vary considerably as well. As a bond, citizenship extends beyond basic kinship ties to unite people of different genetic backgrounds. It usually signifies membership in a political body. It is often based on, or was a result of, some form of military service or expectation of future service. It usually involves some form of political participation, but this can vary from token acts to active service in government. 

Citizenship is a status in society. It is an ideal state as well. It generally describes a person with legal rights within a given political order. It almost always has an element of exclusion, meaning that some people are not citizens, and that this distinction can sometimes be very important, or not important, depending on a particular society. Citizenship as a concept is generally hard to isolate intellectually and compare with related political notions, since it relates to many other aspects of society such as the [[family]], [[military service]], the individual, [[political freedom|freedom]], [[religion]], ideas of [[ethics|right and wrong]], [[ethnicity]], and patterns for how a person should behave in society.&lt;ref name=tws2Y14/&gt; When there are many different groups within a nation, citizenship may be the only real bond which unites everybody as equals without discrimination—it is a "broad bond" linking "a person with the state" and gives people a universal identity as a legal member of a specific nation.&lt;ref name=tws2Y15&gt;{{Cite book

* The civic-republican or sometimes classical or civic humanist conception of citizenship emphasizes man's political nature, and sees citizenship as an active process, not a passive state or legal marker.&lt;ref name=tws2Y18/&gt; It is relatively more concerned that government will interfere with popular places to practice citizenship in the [[public sphere]].

Scholars suggest that the concept of citizenship contains many unresolved issues, sometimes called tensions, existing within the relation, that continue to reflect uncertainty about what citizenship is supposed to mean.&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt; Some unresolved issues regarding citizenship include questions about what is the proper balance between [[duties]] and [[rights]].&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt; Another is a question about what is the proper balance between political citizenship versus social citizenship.&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt; Some thinkers see benefits with people being absent from public affairs, since too much participation such as revolution can be destructive, yet too little participation such as total apathy can be problematic as well.&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt; Citizenship can be seen as a special elite status, and it can also be seen as a democratizing force and something that everybody has; the concept can include both senses.&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt; According to [[sociology|sociologist]] [[Arthur Stinchcombe]], citizenship is based on the extent that a person can control one's own destiny within the group in the sense of being able to influence the government of the group.&lt;ref name=tws2Y14&gt;{{Cite book

==International==
{{See also|Global citizenship}}
Some [[intergovernmental organization]]s have extended the concept and terminology associated with citizenship to the international level,&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniele Archibugi]], [http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8737.html ''"The Global Commonwealth of Citizens. Toward Cosmopolitan Democracy"''], [[Princeton University Press]], Princeton, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; where it is applied to the totality of the citizens of their constituent countries combined. Citizenship at this level is a secondary concept, with rights deriving from national citizenship.

===European Union===
{{Main article|Citizenship of the European Union}}
The [[Maastricht Treaty]] introduced the concept of [[citizenship of the European Union]]. Article 17 (1) of the [[Treaties of the European Union#Treaty on European Union|Treaty on European Union]]&lt;ref&gt;Note: the consolidated version.&lt;/ref&gt; stated that: &lt;blockquote&gt;Citizenship of the Union is hereby established. Every person holding the nationality of a Member State shall be a citizen of the Union. Citizenship of the Union shall be additional to and not replace national citizenship.&lt;ref name="Rome"&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2008:115:0001:01:EN:HTML Consolidated versions of the Treaty on European Union]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An agreement known as the amended [[EC Treaty]]&lt;ref name="Rome" /&gt; established certain minimal rights for European Union citizens. Article 12 of the amended EC Treaty guaranteed a general right of non-discrimination within the scope of the Treaty. Article 18 provided a limited right to free movement and residence in Member States other than that of which the European Union citizen is a national. Articles 18-21 and 225 provide certain political rights.

Union citizens have also extensive [[Four Freedoms (European Union)|rights to move in order to exercise economic activity]] in any of the Member States&lt;ref&gt;Note: Articles 39, 43, 49 EC.&lt;/ref&gt; which predate the introduction of Union citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;Violaine Hacker, « Citoyenneté culturelle et politique européenne des médias : entre compétitivité et promotion des valeurs », NATIONS, CULTURES ET ENTREPRISES EN EUROPE, sous la direction de Gilles Rouet, Collection Local et Global, L'Harmattan, Paris, pp. 163-184&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commonwealth===
The concept of "[[Commonwealth citizen|Commonwealth Citizenship]]" has been in place ever since the establishment of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. As with the EU, one holds Commonwealth citizenship only by being a citizen of a Commonwealth member state. This form of citizenship offers certain privileges within some Commonwealth countries:
* Some such countries do not require tourist [[visa (document)|visas]] of citizens of other Commonwealth countries.
* In some Commonwealth countries [[permanent resident|resident]] citizens of other Commonwealth countries are entitled to political rights, e.g., the [[right to vote]] in local and national elections and in some cases even the right to stand for election.
* In some instances the right to work in any position (including the [[civil service]]) is granted, except for certain specific positions, such as in the defense departments, [[Governor-General]] or [[President]] or [[Prime Minister]].

Although [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] was excluded from the Commonwealth in 1949 because it declared itself a republic, Ireland is generally treated as if it were still a member. Legislation often specifically provides for equal treatment between Commonwealth countries and Ireland and refers to "Commonwealth countries and Ireland".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2005/246/pdfs/uksi_20050246_en.pdf The Commonwealth Countries and Ireland (Immunities and Privileges) (Amendment) Order 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; Ireland's citizens are not classified as foreign nationals in the [[United Kingdom]].

Canada departed from the principle of nationality being defined in terms of allegiance in 1921. In 1935 the [[Irish Free State]] was the first to introduce its own citizenship. However, [[Irish citizen]]s were still treated as [[British subject|subjects of the Crown]], and they are still not regarded as foreign, even though Ireland is not a member of the Commonwealth.&lt;ref&gt;''Murray v Parkes'' [1942] All ER 123.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Canadian Citizenship Act 1946|Canadian Citizenship Act]] of 1947 provided for a distinct Canadian Citizenship, automatically conferred upon most individuals born in Canada, with some exceptions, and defined the conditions under which one could become a naturalized citizen. The concept of Commonwealth citizenship was introduced in 1948 in the [[History of British nationality law#British Nationality Act 1948|British Nationality Act 1948]]. Other [[dominion]]s adopted this principle such as [[New Zealand]],  by way of the British Nationality and New Zealand Citizenship Act of 1948.

==Subnational==
Citizenship most usually relates to membership of the nation state, but the term can also apply at the subnational level. [[Subnational entity|Subnational entities]] may impose requirements, of [[Residency (domicile)|residency]] or otherwise, which permit citizens to participate in the political life of that entity, or to enjoy benefits provided by the government of that entity. But in such cases, those eligible are also sometimes seen as "citizens" of the relevant state, province, or region. An example of this is how the fundamental basis of [[Switzerland|Swiss]] citizenship is citizenship of an individual [[Commune (administrative division)|commune]], from which follows citizenship of a [[Canton (country subdivision)|canton]] and of the Confederation. Another example is [[Åland]] where the residents enjoy a special provincial citizenship within [[Finland]], ''hembygdsrätt''.

The United States has a federal system in which a person is a citizen of their specific state of residence, such as [[New Jersey]] or [[California]], as well as a [[Citizenship in the United States|citizen of the United States]]. State [[constitution]]s may grant certain rights above and beyond what are granted under the [[United States Constitution]] and may impose their own obligations including the sovereign right of taxation and military service; each state maintains at least one military force subject to national militia transfer service, the state's national guard, and some states maintain a second military force not subject to nationalization.

[[File:Diagram of citizenship.jpg|thumb|Diagram of relationship between; Citizens, Politicians + Laws]]

==Education==
{{Main article|Citizenship education (subject)}}
"[[Active citizenship]]" is the philosophy that citizens should work towards the betterment of their community through economic participation, public, volunteer work, and other such efforts to improve life for all citizens. In this vein, citizenship education is taught in schools, as an academic subject in some countries. By the time children reach secondary education there is an emphasis on such unconventional subjects to be included in academic curriculum. While the diagram on citizenship to the right is rather facile and depth-less, it is simplified to explain the general model of citizenship that is taught to many secondary school pupils. The idea behind this model within education is to instill in young pupils that their actions (i.e. their [[Election|vote]]) affect collective citizenship and thus in turn them.

===Republic of Ireland===
It is taught in the [[Republic of Ireland]] as an exam subject for the Junior Certificate. It is known as Civic, Social and Political Education (CSPE). A new Leaving Certificate exam subject with the working title 'Politics &amp; Society' is being developed by the [[National Council for Curriculum and Assessment]] (NCCA) and is expected to be introduced to the curriculum sometime after 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncca.ie/en/Publications/Reports/Senior_Cycle_Politics_and_Society_Report_on_the_consultation.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
Citizenship is offered as a [[General Certificate of Secondary Education]] (GCSE) course in many schools in the [[United Kingdom]]. As well as teaching knowledge about [[democracy]], parliament, government, the justice system, [[human rights]] and the UK's relations with the wider world, students participate in active citizenship, often involving a social action or social enterprise in their local community.
*Citizenship is a compulsory subject of the National Curriculum in state schools in [[England]] for all pupils aged 11–16. Some schools offer a qualification in this subject at [[GCSE]] and [[A level]]. All state schools have a statutory requirement to teach the subject, assess pupil attainment and report student's progress in citizenship to parents.&lt;ref name=dfes&gt;{{cite web

*Citizenship is not taught as a discrete subject in [[Scotland|Scottish]] schools, but is a cross-curricular strand of the Curriculum for Excellence. However they do teach a subject called "Modern Studies" which covers the social, political and economic study of local, national and international issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.msa-scotland.co.uk/
|title=Modern Studies Association
|accessdate=2007-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Citizenship is taught as a standalone subject in all state [[Education in Northern Ireland|schools in Northern Ireland]] and most other schools in some forms from year 8 to 10 prior to [[GCSEs]]. Components of Citizenship are then also incorporated into GCSE courses such as 'Learning for Life and Work'.

There are two kinds of criticism of citizenship education in schools. Firstly, some philosophers of education argue that most governments and mainstream policies stimulate and advocate questionable approaches of citizenship education. These approaches aim to develop specific dispositions in students, dispositions conducive to political participation and solidarity. But there are radically different views on the nature of good citizenship and education should involve and develop autonomy and open-mindedness. Therefore, it requires a more critical approach than is possible when political participation and solidarity are conceived of as goals of education.&lt;ref name="Van der Ploeg &amp; Guérin"&gt;Van der Ploeg, P.A. &amp; L.J.F. Guérin (2016) Questioning Participation and Solidarity as Goals of Citizenship Education. ''Critical Review'', DOI: 10.1080/08913811.2016.1191191 [https://www.academia.edu/28404527/Questioning_Participation_and_Solidarity_as_Goals_of_Citizenship_Education]&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, some educationalists argue that merely teaching children about the theory of citizenship is ineffective, unless schools themselves reflect democratic practices by giving children the opportunity to have a say in decision making. They suggest that schools are fundamentally undemocratic institutions, and that such a setting cannot instill in children the commitment and belief in democratic values that is necessary for citizenship education to have a proper impact.&lt;ref name=Greenberg&gt;Greenberg, D. (1992), Education in America - A View from Sudbury Valley, [https://books.google.com/books?id=YQn_BA76TF4C&amp;pg=PA103&amp;lpg=PA103&amp;dq=Greenberg+Education+in+America+-+A+View+from+Sudbury+Valley+%22Democracy+Must+be+Experienced+to+be+Learned%22#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false "Democracy Must be Experienced to be Learned."] Retrieved 14 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Some educationalists relate this criticism to John Dewey (see critical comments on this interpretation of Dewey: Van der Ploeg, 2016).&lt;ref name="Van der Ploeg"&gt;Van der Ploeg, P.A. (2016) Dewey versus ‘Dewey’ on democracy and education, ''Education, Citizenship and Social Justice'', DOI: 10.1177/1746197916648283 [https://www.academia.edu/26426259/Dewey_versus_Dewey_on_democracy_and_education]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Clown Care''', also known as '''hospital clowning''', is a program in health care facilities involving visits from specially trained [[clowns]]. They are colloquially called "clown doctors" which is a trademarked name in several countries. These visits to hospitals have been shown to help in lifting patients moods with the positive power of hope and [[humor]]. There is also an associated positive benefit to the staff and families of patients.&lt;ref&gt;Battrick, Cath; Glasper, Edward Alan; Prudhoe, Gill and Weaver, Katy. 2007. “Clown Humour: The Perceptions of Doctors, Nurses, Parents and Children.” Journal of Children's and Young People's Nursing 1(4): 174-179.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[Patch Adams]], considered the first hospital clown, started being a hospital clown in the 1970s. He was portrayed in the movie [[Patch Adams (film)|Patch Adams]] by [[Robin Williams]], bringing attention to hospital clowning.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.humourfoundation.com.au/resources/history-of-clowning.html|title=History of Clowning|last=Farrell|first=Melinda|date=|website=Humour Foundation|publisher=|access-date=2017-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional Clown Doctors began working in hospitals in 1986 under a program called [[the Big Apple Circus|the Big Apple Circus Clown Care Unit]], which was started by Michael Christensen in [[New York City]]. Clown Doctor programs now operate in every state in [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radionz.co.nz/national/programmes/afternoons/audio/2005278/clown-doctors Mora, Jim. July 14, 2009. "Clown Doctors." ''Radio New Zealand National'' interview]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]], [[Israel]], [[South Africa]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Brazil]], and all over [[Europe]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Clown Doctors attend specifically to the psycho-social needs of the hospitalized child but in some hospitals they also visit adults.&lt;ref&gt;Nuttman-Shwartz, Orit; Scheyer, Rachel and Tzioni, Herzl. 2010. “Medical Clowning: Even Adults Deserve a Dream.” Social Work in Health Care 49: 581–598.&lt;/ref&gt; They parody the hospital routine to help children adapt to their surroundings, they also distract from and demystify painful or frightening procedures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Tener Dafna |author2=Lev-Wiesel Rachel |author3=Lang-Franco Nessia |author4=Ofir Shoshi | year = 2010 | title = Laughing Through This Pain: Medical Clowning During Examination of Sexually Abused Children: An Innovative Approach | url = | journal = Journal of Child Sexual Abuse | volume = 19 | issue = 2| pages = 128–140 | doi=10.1080/10538711003622752}}&lt;/ref&gt; The atmosphere of fun and laughter can help children forget about the illness and the stress for a moment.

Clown Doctors use techniques such as magic, music, storytelling and other clowning skills to empower children with doses of fun that help them deal with the range of emotions they may experience while in hospital: fear, anxiety,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Vagnoli Laura |author2=Caprilli Simona |author3=Robiglio Arianna |author4=Messeri Andrea | year = 2005 | title = Clown Doctors as a Treatment for Preoperative Anxiety in Children: A Randomized, Prospective Study | url = | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 116 | issue = 4| pages = 563–567 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Golan G, Tighe P, Dobija N, Perel N, Keidan I | year = 2009 | title = Clowns for the Prevention of Preoperative Anxiety in Children: A Randomized Controlled Trial | url = | journal = Pediatric Anesthesia | volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 262–266 | doi=10.1111/j.1460-9592.2008.02903.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; loneliness, boredom.

The healing power of humor and laughter combats stress, reduces pain by releasing endorphin (the body's natural painkiller), boosts the immune system by increasing the level of [[T cells]] &amp; lowering serum [[cortisol]] levels, helps promote a positive outlook, helps people to cope with difficult situations and helps to create bonds and therefore support between people, all of which aids the healing process.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Research on the physiological health benefits on laughter has been conducted for decades and continues to be carried out by medical physicians internationally. There is also a growing group of researchers that are exploring the psychological benefits of laughter, and specifically the work of Clown-Doctors.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nicklauschildrens.org/news-and-events/press-releases/big-apple-circus-clown-care-celebrates-15-years Nicklaus Childrens, Big Apple Circus Clown Care® Celebrates 15 Years of Bringing Smiles to Hospitalized Children at Nicklaus Children’s Hospital]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.simplycircus.com/sites/default/files/4_3.pdf Clown as interpreters of emotions, by Alberto Dionigi P.A.T.

'''Doppler Orbitography and Radiopositioning Integrated by Satellite''' or, in French, '''Détermination d'Orbite et Radiopositionnement Intégré par Satellite''' (in both case yielding the acronym '''DORIS''') is a [[France|French]] satellite system used for the determination of [[satellite orbit]]s (e.g. [[TOPEX/Poseidon]]) and for [[position fixing|positioning]].

==Principle==

Ground-based [[radio beacons]] emit a signal which is picked up by receiving satellites. This is in reverse configuration to other [[GNSS]], in which the transmitters are space-borne and receivers are in majority near the surface of the Earth. A frequency shift of the signal occurs that is caused by the movement of the satellite ([[Doppler effect]]). From this observation satellite orbits, ground positions, as well as other parameters can be derived.

==Organization==

DORIS is a French system which was initiated and is maintained by the French Space Agency ([[CNES]]). It is operated from [[Toulouse]].

==Ground segment==
[[File:DNO DORIS.jpg|thumb|upright|The UHF transmitting antenna of DORIS ground station at Dionysos, Greece]]

The [[ground segment]] includes about 50-60 [[ground station]]s, equally distributed over the earth and ensure a good coverage for orbit determination. For the installation of a beacon only electricity is required because the station only emits a signal but does not receive any information. DORIS beacons transmit to the satellites on two UHF frequencies, 401.25&amp;nbsp;MHz and 2036.25&amp;nbsp;MHz.

===Australian ground segments===
There have been two active DORIS [[Earth stations in Australia|stations in Australia]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Australia|first1=c\=AU\;o\=Australia Government\;ou\=Geoscience|title=Doppler Orbitography and Radiopositioning Integrated by Satellite|url=http://www.ga.gov.au/scientific-topics/positioning-navigation/geodesy/geodetic-techniques/doris|website=www.ga.gov.au|publisher=Geoscience Australia|accessdate=24 June 2017|language=EN|date=15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Yatharagga]] - Active
* [[Orroral Valley Tracking Station]] - No longer active.
* [[Mount Stromlo Observatory]] - Currently active, replaced Orroral Valley Tracking station installation

==Space segment==

The best known satellites equipped with DORIS receivers are the altimetry satellites [[TOPEX/Poseidon]], [[Jason 1]], [[Jason 2]], and [[Jason-3|Jason 3]]. They are used to observe the ocean surface as well as currents or wave heights. DORIS contributes to their orbit accuracy of about 2&amp;nbsp;cm.

Other DORIS satellites are the [[Envisat]], [[SPOT (satellite)|SPOT]], HY-2A and [[CryoSat-2]] satellites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aviso.altimetry.fr/en/techniques/doris/doris-missions.html |title=Doris-Equipped Satellites}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Positioning==

Apart from orbit determination, the DORIS observations are used for positioning of ground stations. The accuracy is a bit lower than with [[GPS]], but it still contributes to the [[International Terrestrial Reference Frame]] (ITRF).

In 1998, Braschi left the Catholic Church for the  [[Catholic Apostolic Charismatic Church of Jesus the King]] and became bishop of it.&lt;ref name=Vatican85 /&gt; On June 29, 2002, on a boat on the [[Danube River]], Austria,&lt;ref name=Vatican85 /&gt; Braschi ordained seven Catholic women, called the [[Danube Seven]], to the priesthood: Christine Mayr-Lumetzberger, Adelinde Roitinger, Gisela Forster, Iris Müller, Ida Raming, Pia Brunner and Dagmar Braun Celeste (who called herself Angela White).&lt;ref name=Vatican1221 /&gt; The Bishop of Linz and of the Austrian Episcopal Conference intervened, but to no avail.&lt;ref name=Vatican1221 /&gt; On July 10, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith warned the eight persons that they would be excommunicated on July 22 if they did not repent.&lt;ref name=Vatican1221 /&gt; On August 5, the Congregation issued a decree of excommunication of the eight persons.&lt;ref name=Vatican1221 /&gt; The excommunicated people then published letters and granted interviews about the ordinations, explaining how it was valid, that the Catholic Church ought to allow women to be ordained, and how they had celebrated the sacraments.&lt;ref name=Vatican1221 /&gt; On August 14 and September 27, the people requested the Congregation to revoke the excommunication.&lt;ref name=Vatican1221 /&gt; The latter request made reference to canons regarding recourse against administrative decrees in the [[Code of Canon Law]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/_P6Y.HTM Vatican.Va: Code of Canon Law 1732-1739]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Vatican1221 /&gt; On October 21, the Congregation replied that it would look into the matter.&lt;ref name=Vatican1221 /&gt;

=Contents=
The decree explains the excommunicated party's background, then the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith's response to the party's request for the revocation of their excommunication.&lt;ref name=Vatican1221 /&gt; The response was prepared by fifteen members of the Congregation: Cardinals Joseph Ratzinger, Alfonso López Trujillo, Ignace Moussa I. Daoud, Giovanni Battista Re, Francis Arinze, Jozef Tomko, Achille Silvestrini, Jorge Medina Estévez, James Francis Stafford, Zenon Grocholewski, Walter Kasper, Crescenzio Sepe, Mario Francesco Pompedda and Bishops Tarcisio Bertone, SDB, and Rino Fisichella.&lt;ref name=Vatican1221 /&gt; The fifteen members met multiple times to discuss the matter, and ultimately came to a "collegial decision" to not revoke the excommunication.&lt;ref name=Vatican1221 /&gt; The Congregation listed the reasons for why this was the case: the excommunication was not a [[latae sententiae]] penalty, but a [[ferendae sententiae]] penalty, as per Canons 1314, 1319, and 1347; the excommunication was issued by the [[Pope]] through the Congregation, as per Canon 360; the offense was grave and evident; the women, by choosing to be ordained by a schismatic, became schismatics themselves; the women rejected the [[magisterium]] of the Pope and the dogma on ordination that he definitively proposed in ''[[Ordinatio Sacerdotalis]]''; the women, by inciting other Catholics to schism, were justly punished so as to protect the faith, communion and unity of the church and guide the consciences of the faithful; and the excommunication was intended to provoke the six persons to [[repentance]].&lt;ref name=Vatican1221 /&gt;

'''Deimachus''' ({{IPAc-en|d|i|ˈ|ɪ|m|ə|k|ə|s}}; Greek Δηίμαχος) was a [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] of the [[Seleucid Empire]] who lived during the third-century BCE. He became an ambassador to the court of [[Bindusara]] "Amitragata" (son of [[Chandragupta Maurya]]) in [[Pataliputra]] in [[India]].{{sfn|Mookerji|1988|p=38}}

As an ambassador, he was the successor to the famous ambassador and historian [[Megasthenes]]. Both of them were mentioned by [[Strabo]]:

:"Both of these men were sent ambassadors to Palimbothra (Pataliputra): Megasthenes to Sandrocottus, Deimachus to Allitrochades his son".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0239&amp;query=head%3D%2311 Strabo II,I, 9]&lt;/ref&gt;

Deimachus apparently wrote extensively on India, and is quoted as a reference in geographical matters, although his works are now lost:
:"It is likely there are more than 3000 stadia, but taking this number, if we add thereto the 30,000 stadia, which Deimachus states there are between [the southern extremity of India] and the country of the Bactrians and Sogdians, we shall find both of these nations lie beyond the temperate zone and habitable earth." (Strabo II,1,14)
:"The computations of Megasthenes and Deïmachus are more moderate, for they estimate the distance from the Southern Sea to Caucasus at above 20,000 stadia."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0239&amp;query=section%3D%231263 Strabo XV,1,12]&lt;/ref&gt;

Strabo, however, disputed these figures, and some of the fanciful accounts of both men, although they also brought extensive knowledge about India:

:"Generally speaking, the men who hitherto have written on the affairs of India, were a set of liars. Deimachus holds the first place in the list, Megasthenes comes next, while [[Onesicritus]] and [[Nearchus]], with others of the same class, manage to stammer out a few words [of truth]. Of this we became the more convinced whilst writing the history of Alexander. No faith whatever can be placed in Deimachus and Megasthenes. They coined the fables concerning men with ears large enough to sleep in, men without any mouths, without noses, with only one eye, with spider-legs, and with fingers bent backward. They renewed Homer's fable concerning the battles of the Cranes and Pygmies, and asserted the latter to be three spans high. They told of ants digging for gold, of Pans with wedge-shaped heads, of serpents swallowing down oxen and stags, horns and all; meantime, as [[Eratosthenes]] has observed, reciprocally accusing each other of falsehood." (Strabo II, I, 9).

'''Egyptian [[faience]]''' is a [[sintered]]-[[quartz]] [[ceramic]] displaying surface [[Glass transition|vitrification]] which creates a bright lustre of various colours, with blue-green being the most common. Defined as a "material made from powdered quartz covered with a true vitreous coating, usually in a transparent blue or green isotropic glass", faience is distinct from the crystalline compound [[Egyptian blue]].&lt;ref&gt;David Frederick Grose, The Toledo Museum of Art, Early Ancient Glass: Core-Formed, Rod-Formed, and Cast Vessels and Objects from the Late Bronze Age to the Early Roman Empire, 1600 BC to AD 50 (Manchester: Hudson Hills Press, 1999), 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Faience is considerably more porous than glass proper. It can be cast in molds to create vessels, jewelry  and decorative  objects.&lt;ref&gt;Grose, The Toledo Museum of Art, Early Ancient Glass, 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Although it contains the major constituents of [[glass]] (silica, lime) and no [[clay]] until late periods, faience is frequently discussed in surveys of ancient pottery, as in stylistic and art-historical terms objects made of it are closer to pottery styles than [[ancient Egyptian glass]].

Egyptian faience was very widely used for small objects from beads to small statues, and is found in both elite and popular contexts. It was the most common material for [[Scarab (artifact)|scarabs]] and other forms of amulet and [[ushabti]] figures, and used in most forms of ancient Egyptian jewellery, as the glaze made it smooth against the skin. Larger applications included cups and bowls, and [[wall tile]]s, mostly used for temples.&lt;ref&gt;Peck, William H., "The Material World of Ancient Egypt", 2013, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|1107276381}}, 9781107276383, [https://books.google.com/books?id=MV8UAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT192 google books]&lt;/ref&gt; The well-known blue figures of a [[hippopotamus]], placed in the tombs of officials, can be up to 20&amp;nbsp;cm long,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/hippopotamus-figurine Louvre: Hippopotamus figurine, Department of Egyptian Antiquities]: From the late prehistoric period to the late Middle Kingdom (circa 3800 - 1710 BC)&lt;/ref&gt; approaching the maximum practical size for faience, though the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in London has a {{convert|215.9|cm|adj=on}} faience [[sceptre]] from Egypt dated 1427–1400 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O131268/sceptre/ |title=Sceptre &amp;#124; V&amp;A Search the Collections |publisher=Collections.vam.ac.uk |date=2013-11-04 |accessdate=2013-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope of the term==
[[File:Egyptian - Group of 16 Amulets Strung as a Necklace - Walters 481685-1699 - View A.jpg|thumb|left|Group of 16 amulets strung as a necklace, in the typical bright faience blue, [[Late Period of ancient Egypt|Late Period]]]]
It is called "Egyptian faience" to distinguish it from [[faience]], the [[tin-glazed pottery]] associated with [[Faenza]] in northern Italy.&lt;ref name="Nicholson and Peltenburg"&gt;Nicholson and Peltenburg 2000. Ancient Egyptian Materials and Technology. In: Nicholson, P.T. and Shaw, I.Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 177-194.137–142.&lt;/ref&gt; Egyptian faience was both exported widely in the ancient world and made locally in many places, and is found in [[Mesopotamia]], around the Mediterranean and in northern Europe as far away as [[Scotland]]. The term is used for the material wherever it was made and modern scientific analyses are often the only way of establishing the provenance of simple objects such as the very common beads.&lt;ref name="Nicholson and Peltenburg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stone and Thomas 1956"&gt;Stone and Thomas 1956. The Use and Distribution of Faience in the Ancient East and Prehistoric Europe, Proceedings of the Prehistoric Society, London 22, 37–84.–142.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is therefore unsatisfactory in several respects, although clear in an Ancient Egyptian context, and is increasingly rejected in museum and archaeological usage. The [[British Museum]] now calls this material "glazed composition", with the following note in the "information" box on their online collection database: &lt;blockquote&gt;"The term is used for objects with a body made of finely powdered quartz grains fused together with small amounts of alkali and/or lime through partial heating. The bodies are usually colourless but natural impurities give them a brown or greyish tint. Colourants can also be added to give it an artificial colour. It can be modelled by hand, thrown or moulded, and hardens with firing. This material is used in the context of Islamic ceramics where it is described as stonepaste (or fritware). Glazed composition is related to glass, but glass is formed by completely fusing the ingredients in a liquid melted at high temperature. This material is also popularly called faience in the contexts of Ancient Egypt and Ancient Near East. However, this is a misnomer as these objects have no relationship to the glazed pottery vessels made in Faenza, from which the faience term derives. Other authors use the terms sintered quartz, glazed frit, frit, composition, Egyptian Blue, paste or (in the 19th century) even porcelain, although the last two terms are very inappropriate as they also describe imitation gems and a type of ceramic. [[Frit]] is technically a flux."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=398153&amp;partId=1&amp;searchText=faience&amp;page=1|title=figure|website=British Museum|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From the inception of faience in the archaeological record of [[Ancient Egypt]], the elected colors of the [[Ceramic glaze|glaze]]s varied within an array of blue-green hues. Glazed in these colours, faience was perceived as substitute for blue-green materials such as [[turquoise]], found in the [[Sinai Peninsula]], and [[lapis lazuli]] from [[Afghanistan]].&lt;ref name="Nicholson and Peltenburg"/&gt; According to the archaeologist David Frederick Grose, the quest to imitate precious stones "explains why most all early glasses are opaque and brilliantly colored" and that the deepest blue color imitating lapis lazuli was likely the most sought-after.&lt;ref&gt;David Frederick Grose, The Toledo Museum of Art, Early Ancient Glass, 45.&lt;/ref&gt; As early as the Predynastic graves at [[Naqada]], Badar, el-Amrah, Matmar, Harageh, Avadiyedh and El-Gerzeh, glazed [[steatite]] and faience beads are found associated with these semi-precious stones.&lt;ref name="Nicholson"&gt;Nicholson 1998. Nicholson, P.T.1993. Egyptian faience and glass. Aylesbury: Shire- Egyptology.137–142.&lt;/ref&gt; The association of faience with turquoise and lapis lazuli becomes even more conspicuous in Quennou's funerary papyrus, giving his title as the director of overseer of faience-making, using the word which strictly means lapis lazuli, which by the [[New Kingdom]] had also come to refer to the 'substitute', faience.&lt;ref name="Nicholson and Peltenburg"/&gt; The symbolism embedded in blue glazing could recall both the [[Nile]], the waters of [[heaven]] and the home of the [[god]]s, whereas green could possibly evoke images of regeneration, rebirth and vegetation.&lt;ref name="Friedman"&gt;Friedman, F.D. (ed.). 1998. Gifts of the Nile-ancient Egyptian faience. London: Thames and Hudson. 177-194.137–142.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship with Egyptian copper industry===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Map of Ancient Egypt.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Map of Ancient Egyptian workshops or cities that have been associated with faience materials]] --&gt;

The discovery of faience glazing has tentatively been associated with the [[copper]] industry: [[bronze]] scale and corrosion products of leaded copper objects are found in the manufacture of faience [[pigment]]s.&lt;ref name="Kaczamrcyz and Hedges"&gt;Kaczamrcyz, A. and Hedges. R.E.M. 1983. Ancient Egyptian Faience. Warminster: Aris and Phillips.137–142.&lt;/ref&gt; However, although the likelihood of glazed [[quartz]] pebbles developing accidentally in traces in copper [[smelting]] [[furnace]]s from the copper and wood ash is high, the regions in which these processes originate do not coincide.&lt;ref name="Petrie"&gt;Petrie, W. M. F.1909. Memphis I, London: British School of Archeology in Egypt.137–142.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship with Egyptian glass industry===
Although it appears that no [[glass]] was intentionally produced in Egypt before the [[Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Eighteenth Dynasty]] (as the establishment of glass manufacture is generally attributed to the reign of [[Thutmose III]]), it is likely that faience, [[frit]] and glass were all made in close proximity or in the same workshop complex, since developments in one industry are reflected in others.&lt;ref name="Nicholson"/&gt; Such close relationship is reflected in the prominent similarity of the formulations of faience glaze and contemporary glass compositions.&lt;ref name="Kaczamrcyz and Hedges"/&gt; Despite the differences in the pyrotechnology of glass and faience, faience being worked cold, archaeological evidence suggests that New Kingdom glass and faience production was undertaken in the same workshops.&lt;ref name="Nicholson and Peltenburg"/&gt;

==Production==

===Typical composition and access to raw materials===
Faience has been defined as the first high technology ceramic, to emphasize its status as an artificial medium, rendering it effectively a precious stone.&lt;ref name="Vandiver"&gt;Vandiver, P.B.F.1983. Egyptian faience technology, Appendix A. In: A. Kaczmarczyk and R.E.M. Hedges, Editors, Ancient Egyptian Faience,Warminster: Aris and Phillips, A1–A14&lt;/ref&gt; Egyptian faience is a non-clay based ceramic composed of crushed quartz or sand, with small amounts of [[calcite]] [[lime (material)|lime]] and a mixture of [[alkali]]s, displaying surface [[Glass transition|vitrification]] due to the [[soda-lime glass|soda lime]] [[silica]] [[Ceramic glaze|glaze]] often containing copper pigments to create a bright blue-green luster.&lt;ref name="Nicholson and Peltenburg"/&gt; While in most instances domestic ores seem to have provided the bulk of the mineral pigments, evidence suggests that during periods of prosperity, raw materials not available locally, such as lead and copper, were imported.&lt;ref name="Kaczamrcyz and Hedges"/&gt; Plant ash, from "[[halophyte]]" (salt-tolerant) plants typical of dry and sea areas, was the major source of alkali until the Ptolemaic Period, when [[natron]]-based alkalis almost completely replaced the previous source.&lt;ref name="Vandiver"/&gt; Although the chemical composition of faience materials varies over time and according to the status of the workshop, also as a cause of change of accessibility of raw materials, the material constitution of the glaze is at all times consistent with the generally accepted version of faience glazing.&lt;ref name="Kaczamrcyz and Hedges"/&gt;

===Faience working technology===
Typical faience mixture is [[thixotropic]], that is thick at first and then soft and flowing as it begins to be formed.&lt;ref name="Kiefer and Allibert'"&gt;Kiefer, C. and Allibert, A. 2007. Pharanoic Blue Ceramics: the Process of Self-glazing. Archeology 24, 107–117&lt;/ref&gt;
This property, together with the angularity of silica particles, accounts for the gritty slumps formed when the material is wetted, rendering faience a difficult material to hold a shape.&lt;ref name="Noble'"&gt;Noble, J. V. 1969. The technique of Egyptian faience. American Journal of Archaeology 73, 435–439&lt;/ref&gt; If pressed too vigorously, this material will resist flow until it yields and cracks, due to its limited plastic deformation and low yield strength.&lt;ref name="Vandiver"/&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Predynastic, old kingdom and first intermediate period.gif|thumb|right|200px|Predynastic, Old kingdom and first intermediate period faience typologies and techniques.]] --&gt;
[[File:Egyptian - Vase with Names of Amenhotep III and Queen Tiye - Walters 48403.jpg|thumb|left|This faience vessel from the reign of [[Amenhotep III]] exhibits two different shades of blue that can be achieved by adding [[cobalt]] and [[copper]] pigments to faience paste.[[Walters Art Museum]], [[Baltimore]].]]

===Body binding technology===
A number of possible binding agents, amongst [[Arabic gum]], [[clay]], [[Lime (material)|lime]], [[egg white]] and [[resin]], have been suggested to help in the binding process.&lt;ref name="Lucas and Harris'"/&gt; Although traces of clay have been found in most Pharaonic faience, reconstruction experiments showed that clay, [[organic gum]]s or lime while successfully improving the wet working performance, failed to improve the fired strength of the faience, or proved the gum was too sticky for the removal of objects from their molds.&lt;ref name="Nicholson and Peltenburg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vandiver"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lucas and Harris'"&gt;Lucas, A. and Harris, J. R., 1962, Ancient Egyptian materials and industries. London: Edward Arnold. 435–439&lt;/ref&gt; The use of alkalis as binders, in the form of natron or plant ash, produced suitable results in experiments.&lt;ref name="Nicholson and Peltenburg"/&gt; Pulverized glass or sintered material of similar composition could also enhance the fired strength of faience bodies: the compositions of such glasses is in fact comparable to the published compositions of New Kingdom glass.&lt;ref name="Kaczamrcyz and Hedges"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kühne, K.'"&gt;Kühne, K. 1974 "Frühgeschichtliche Werkstoffe auf Silikatischer Basis", Das Altertum 20, 67–80&lt;/ref&gt;

===Body working technology===
Three methods have been hypothesized to shape the body of faience objects: modeling, moulding and abrasion, the last being used in conjunction with the first two.&lt;ref name="Nicholson and Peltenburg"/&gt; Modeling, scraping and grinding are the techniques most widely used in earlier times, as represented in the material qualities of Predynastic and Protodynastic faience objects.&lt;ref name="Nicholson"/&gt; Predynastic bead manufacture is essentially a cold technology, more akin to stone working than glass: a general form of faience is modeled, possibly free formed by hand, then holes are drilled to create beads.&lt;ref name="Nicholson"/&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Middle kingdom and new kingdom faience.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Middle Kingdom and New Kingdom period faience typologies and techniques.]] --&gt;
In the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]], the techniques employed are molding and forming on a core, sometimes in conjunction with intermediate layers between the glaze and the body.&lt;ref name="Vandiver"/&gt; Marbleized faience, resulting from the working of different colored faience bodies together, so as to produce a uniform adherent body, also appears in this period.&lt;ref name="Kaczamrcyz and Hedges"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vandiver"/&gt; Towards the end of the Middle Kingdom, incising, inlaying and resisting techniques appear: these were bound to become progressively popular towards the New Kingdom.&lt;ref name="Vandiver"/&gt; In the New Kingdom, beads, amulets and finger rings are produced by a combination of modeling and molding techniques.&lt;ref name="Vandiver"/&gt; In this period, sculptural detail is created using inlays of different colored faience or by scraping the body to reveal the white intermediate layer in relief.&lt;ref name="Vandiver"/&gt; Moulding was first applied to faience manufacture in the Middle Kingdom by forming a model of an object, or employing a finished faience piece, impressing it in wet clay, and later by firing the clay to create a durable mold.&lt;ref name="Nicholson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Boyce, A.'"&gt;Notes on the manufacture and use of faience rings at Amarna. In: Kemp, B.J. Amarna Reports V. London: Egypt Exploration Society. 160-168, 160–168&lt;/ref&gt; The faience paste could then be pressed into the mold, and following drying, be re-worked through surface abrasion before firing.&lt;ref name="Nicholson"/&gt; Moulds could facilitate mass production of faience objects such as amulets rings and inlays, as evidenced by the several thousand of small open face, earth-ware clay molds excavated at Tell el Amarna.&lt;ref name="Petrie"/&gt;

[[File:Applique in faience per tempietti in legno, periodo tolemaico, falco 05.jpg|thumb|Falcon, [[Ptolemaic period]], 13.5 cm high, see text]]
Wheel throwing, possibly occurring from the New Kingdom onwards, is certainly established by the Greco-Roman period, when large amounts of clay seem to have been added to the faience body.&lt;ref name="Nicholson"/&gt; Because of the limited plasticity of faience, rendering throwing extremely difficult, a progressive increase of clay in the faience bodies culminating in the quartz, clay and glass frit bodies of Islamic times, is observed in the archaeological record.&lt;ref name="Vandiver"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kiefer '"&gt;Kiefer, C. 1968 Les céramiques blues, pharanoiques et leur procédé révolutionnaire d'emaillage. Industrie Céramique. May, 395–402&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ptolemaic period|Ptolemaic]] and [[Roman Egypt|Roman]] faience tends to be typologically and technologically distinct from the earlier material: it is characterized by the widespread use of moulding and high relief on vessels.&lt;ref name="Shortland and Tite'"&gt;Shortland, A.J. and Tite M.S. 2005. A technological study of Ptolemaic – early roman faience from Memphis, Egypt Archaeometry 47/1, 31–46 31–46&lt;/ref&gt; A very unusual and finely made group of figures of deities and falcons in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York, apparently representing [[hieroglyph]]s that are elements from a royal inscription, perhaps from a wooden shrine, is decorated in a form of [[champleve]] (typically a technique for [[vitreous enamel|enamel]] on metal).  Depressions in the faience body were filled with coloured "vitreous pastes" and refired, followed by polishing.&lt;ref&gt;''Egypt and the Ancient Near East'', 1987, p. 82, Metropolitan Museum of Art, {{ISBN|0870994131}}, 9780870994135, [https://books.google.com/books?id=a08kkuWhv7wC&amp;pg=PA82 google books]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Glazing technology==
The technology of glazing a siliceous body with a soda lime silica glaze employs various methods discovered over time: namely application, efflorescence and cementation glazing.
[[File:Louvre Egyptologie - Vases Ramses II.jpg|thumb|left|Vases probably used for the funeral of [[Rameses II]]]]
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Application of glaze slurry.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Application of glaze slurry: the thickness depends on body porosity and water content of slurry]] --&gt;

===Application glazing===
In the application method, formerly assumed to be the only one used for faience glazing; silica, lime and alkalis are ground in the raw state to a small particle size, thus mixed in water to form a slurry which is then applied to the quartz core.&lt;ref name="Nicholson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Petrie"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lucas and Harris'"/&gt; Partial fritting of the slurry favors the first stages of vitrification, which in turn lowers the final firing temperature. The slurry can be then applied to the body, through brushing or dipping, to create a fine, powdery coating.&lt;ref name="Vandiver"/&gt; Upon firing, the water from the melting glaze partially diffuses in the sand body, sintering the quartz particles and thus creating some solid bridges in the body.&lt;ref name="Vandiver"/&gt;

===Efflorescence glazing===
In the self-glazing process of efflorescence, the glazing materials, in the form of water-soluble alkali salts, are mixed with the raw crushed quartz of the core of the object.&lt;ref name="Kiefer and Allibert'"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Noble'"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Binns'"&gt;Binns. 1932. An experiment in Egyptian blue glaze. Journal of the American Ceramic Society 31–46&lt;/ref&gt; As the water in the body evaporates, the salts migrate to the surface of the object to recrystallize, creating a thin surface, which glazes upon firing.&lt;ref name="Vandiver"/&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Effluorescence of glazing.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Efflorescence glazing: the thickness depends on drying rate&lt;ref name="Vandiver"&gt; Vandiver, P.B.F.1983.A1–A14&lt;/ref&gt;]] --&gt;

===Cementation glazing===
[[File:Louvre calice forme nenuphar.JPG|thumb|Cup with [[Nelumbo nucifera|lotus]] decoration, 14.4 cm high]]
Cementation glazing, a technique discovered in the Middle Kingdom, is also a self-glazing technique.&lt;ref name="Nicholson"/&gt; The possibility of the existence of cementation glazing, also known as '[[Qom technique]]', followed the observation of this method in use at the village of '[[Qom]]' in Iran in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=" Wulff et Al., 1968'"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wulff |first1=H. E. |last2=Wulff |first2=H. S. |last3=Koch |first3=L. |date=1968 |title=Egyptian faience - a possible survival in Iran |journal=Archeology |volume=21 |pages=98–107 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this method the artifact, while buried in a glazing powder with a high flux content, is heated inside a vessel, causing the fusion of the object with the cement. During firing, the flux migrates to the quartz and combines with it to form a glassy coating.&lt;ref name=" Wulff et Al., 1968'"/&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Cementation of glazing.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Cementation of glaze: thickness depends on firing time and temperature&lt;ref name="Vandiver"&gt; Vandiver, P.B.F.1983.A1–A14&lt;/ref&gt;]] --&gt;

===Alternative techniques===
A vapour glaze reaction similar to salt glazing, as an alternative glazing process, has been suggested. In this process, the vaporization or dissociation of salts leads to vapour transport through the enveloping powder to the quartz body where a glaze is formed.&lt;ref name="Williamson 1942"&gt;Williamson, R.S.1942. The Saqqara Graph. Nature 150, 607–607&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recognition of glazing techniques===
Although glaze compositions vary regionally and chronologically, depending on the formation of the body and the glazing process employed, objects produced with different glazing techniques do not exhibit immediate diagnostic chemical variations in their compositions.&lt;ref name="Kaczamrcyz and Hedges"/&gt;&lt;ref name=" Tite et Al. 1983'"&gt;Tite, M.S., Freestone I.C. and Bimson. M. 1983. Egyptian faience: an investigation of the methods of production, Archaeometry 25, 17–27&lt;/ref&gt; The recognition of the various glazing techniques, through microscopic observations of the degree of sintering and the vitreous phase of quartz body, is also ambiguous. For instance, objects with applied glazes and those which may have been glazed by efflorescence have overlapping characteristic features.&lt;ref name="Kaczamrcyz and Hedges"/&gt;&lt;ref name=" Tite and Bimson 1986'"&gt;Tite, M.S. and Bimson, M. 1986. Faience: an investigation of the microstructures associated with the different methods of glazing, Archaeometry 28, 69–78&lt;/ref&gt; The following proposed criteria are subject to variation caused by increases in flux concentration, firing temperatures and time at peak temperatures.&lt;ref name="Vandiver"/&gt;

''Recognition of application glazing''- Macroscopically, applied glazes vary in thickness through the body, displaying thicker glazes on bases.&lt;ref name=" Tite and Bimson 1986'"/&gt; The traces of kiln supports, as well as the characteristic tendency to run and drip leading to pooling, may indicate the orientation of the object during firing.&lt;ref name="Vandiver"/&gt; In high magnification observations, the interface boundary of body and glaze appears well defined.&lt;ref name="Vandiver"/&gt; The absence of interstitial glass in the core is characteristic of application glazing: however, the possibility of adding glazing mixture to the quartz sand body, as well as the use of pre-melted glazes in the later periods, can predictably increase the degree of sintering of the core&lt;ref name="Shortland and Tite'"/&gt;&lt;ref name=" Tite and Bimson 1986'"/&gt;

''Recognition of cementation''- Objects glazed through cementation display a thin even glaze all over the body, with no drying or firing marks, and portray a fairly friable and soft body&lt;ref name="Binns'"/&gt;&lt;ref name=" Tite and Bimson 1986'"/&gt; Microscopically, the concentration of copper characteristically decreases from the surface: the interaction layer is thin and well defined and the interstitial glass is absent with exception to the vicinity of the boundary layer.&lt;ref name="Vandiver"/&gt;&lt;ref name=" Tite and Bimson 1986'"/&gt;

''Recognition of efflorescence glazing''- Pieces glazed by efflorescence may show traces of stand marks: the glaze appears thick and prone to cracking, thinning toward the edge of the piece and in concave areas.&lt;ref name=" Tite and Bimson 1986'"/&gt; In high magnification the interstitial glass is extensive; the unreacted salts which have not reached the surface fuse of the body accumulate in the core, creating bridges between the quartz particles.&lt;ref name=" Tite and Bimson 1986'"/&gt;

==Typologies==
[[File:Medio regno, XII-XVII dinastia, ippopotamo in faience, 1938-1539 ac ca. 01.JPG|thumb|left|[[Hippopotamus]] figure for a tomb, [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]]]]
An extensive literature has accumulated in attempt to explain the processing of Egyptian faience and develop an adequate typology that encompasses both technological choices and chemical variations of faience bodies.&lt;ref name="Nicholson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lucas and Harris'"/&gt;&lt;ref name=" Tite and Bimson 1986'"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brill 1999'"&gt;Brill, R.H. 1999. Chemical Analyses of Early Glasses: Volume 1 (tables) and Volume 2 (catalogue), Corning, NY: Corning Museum of Glass., 69–78&lt;/ref&gt; Body color, density and luster provided the basis of the first typology developed for faience: seven variants were proposed by Lucas and Harris and still permit the archaeologist to distinguish faience objects during field sorting.&lt;ref name="Lucas and Harris'"/&gt;

===Classification of body variants===
Most of the seven variants introduced by Lucas fail to recognize the glazing technology utilized or to suggest the stylistic and technological choices embedded in the manufacture of a faience object. However, variant A describes a technologically unique product and as such is still applicable: it has a finely ground underglaze consisting of quartz particles in a glass matrix, often revealed by incisions or depressions cut into the overlying glaze.&lt;ref name="Kaczamrcyz and Hedges"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shortland and Tite'"/&gt; Glassy faience, variant E, displays no distinct outer layer from the interior, thus it has been suggested that the term 'faience' is a misnomer and the alternative name 'imperfect glass' has been advised.&lt;ref name="Kaczamrcyz and Hedges"/&gt; Regarding variant F specimens, Lucas suggests the use of lead glazes, however it appears that lead glazing was never practiced in Ancient Egypt.&lt;ref name="Kaczamrcyz and Hedges"/&gt;&lt;ref name=" Tite and Bimson 1986'"/&gt;&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Classification_of_body_variants.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Classification of Body Variants&lt;ref name="Lucas and Harris'"&gt;Lucas, A. and Harris, J.

The excavations led by Petrie at Tell-Amarna and Naucratis have reported finding workshop evidence.&lt;ref name="Petrie"/&gt;
Nicholson explains, however, that while a square furnace-like structure at Amarna may be related to faience production, Petrie did not encounter any actual faience Kilns at the site.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson, Egyptian Faience and Glass, 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Lucas documented a large number of molds at the palace area of Amenhotep III, at Qantir from Dynasties 19-20 and at the palace area of Naucratis also described in different sources as a scarab maker's and faience factory.&lt;ref name="Petrie"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lucas and Harris'"/&gt; However, seeing there is a lack of carefully documented archaeological evidence as to the nature of faience factory sites, direct information about the glazing process does not exist.

'''Eshkaft-e Siahoo''' ({{lang-fa|اشکفت سیاهو}}), which means "black cave" in the dialect of the people of the region, is a 10,000-year-old [[neolithic]] stone dwelling near [[Rahmat Mountain]] in the [[Marvdasht Plain]] in the [[Fars province]], [[Iran]]. The cave was discovered in June 2006.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7496">'''Europeanisation''' (or '''Europeanization''', see [[British and American spelling differences|spelling differences]]) refers to a number of related phenomena and patterns of change:
*The process in which a notionally non-European subject (be it a culture, a language, a city or a nation) adopts a number of European features ([[Westernization]]).
*Outside the [[social science]]s, it commonly refers to the growth of a [[Europe]]an continental identity or [[polity]] over and above national identities and polities on the continent. 
*Europeanisation may also refer to the process through which [[European Union]] political and economic dynamics become part of the organisational logic of national politics and policy-making.

==Definitions==
Europeanisation in political science has been referred to very generally as 'becoming more European like'.&lt;ref&gt;Tovias, A., “Spontaneous vs. legal approximation: The Europeanization of Israel”, European Journal of Law Reform, 2007, vol. 9, no. 3, pp. 485-500&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically than this, it has been defined in a number of ways. One of the earliest conceptualisations of the term is by Ladrech (1994, 69) who defines Europeanisation simply as ‘an incremental process of re-orienting the direction and shape of politics to the extent that EC political and economic dynamics become part of the organisational logic of national politics and policy making.’

This emphasises what is known as the 'top-down approach' to Europeanisation with change emanating from the impact of the Union onto the national policy. The state is viewed as re-active towards changes in the union.

Another definition that needs to be taken into account is Radaelli, who describes Europeanisation as ''"a process involving, a) construction, b) diffusion and c) institutionalisation of formal and informal rules, procedures, policy paradigms, styles, 'ways of doing things' and shared beliefs and norms which are first defined and consolidated in the EU policy process and then incorporated in the logic of domestic (national and subnational) discourse, political structures and public choices."''&lt;ref&gt;Michelle Cini, ''European Union Politics 2nd Edition'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2007) p. 407.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, Moumoutzis (2011: 612) has revised Radaelli's definition and he has argued that Europeanisation should be defined as 'a
process of incorporation in the logic of domestic (national and sub-national) discourse, political structures and public policies of formal and informal rules, procedures, policy paradigms, styles, “ways of doing things” and shared beliefs and norms that are first defined in the EU policy processes'.&lt;ref&gt;Moumoutzis, Kyriakos (2011) Still Fashionable Yet Useless? Addressing Problems with Research on the Europeanisation of Foreign Policy, Journal of Common Market Studies, 49(3): 607-629, available at http://www.kent.ac.uk/politics/research/comparativegroup/Fashionable%20Yet%20Useless.pdf{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From a 'bottom-up' approach Europeanisation occurs when states begin to affect the policy of the European Union in a given area.

A more nuanced analysis posits that the institutional interaction of policy actors at the various levels of European governance leads to the re-definition of [[nationalism|national]], [[Regionalism (international relations)|regional]] and [[cultural identity|other identities]] within a European context, where the multiple levels of governance in Europe are not seen as ''necessarily'' in opposition to one another.{{ref|EIII}} An elected representative can, for example, see his loyalties and responsibilities  as lying with [[Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]] and [[Europe]] or with [[Amsterdam]], [[Netherlands]] and Europe, for unitary states.  Some scholars, including [[Samuel P. Huntington|Samuel Huntington]]{{ref|Huntington}}, argue that citizens of European states increasingly identify themselves as such, rather than [[Portugal|Portuguese]], [[United Kingdom|British]], [[France|French]], [[Germany|German]], [[Italy|Italian]] etc.

An obvious area of change is in the institutions of Europe; the [[enlargement of the European Union]] and the gradual acquisition of authority over the national member governments in numerous areas is creating a centralised European polity. The [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union]] would be an example of this; in this case, the nations using the [[euro]] have passed control of their [[monetary policy]] to the [[European Central Bank]].

Another perspective of Europeanisation is the 'horizontal approach.' This approach takes into account the transfer of politics, policies and policy making between member states of the European Union. The transfer is based on a form of 'soft law' therefore it is not enforceable, but is based on 'best practice' and mutual recognition.

Whether Europeanisation is a continuing process that will eventually lead to a full European government or whether centralisation will be unable to overcome persisting national identities and/or increasing interest in [[Localism (politics)|localism]] is a matter of some debate.

'''Fabriano''' is a town and ''[[comune]]'' of [[Province of Ancona|Ancona province]] in the [[Italy|Italian]] region of the [[Marche]], at {{convert|325|m|ft}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]]. It lies in the [[Esino]] valley {{convert|44|km|mi}} upstream and southwest of [[Jesi]]; and {{convert|15|km|mi|0}} east-northeast of [[Fossato di Vico]] and {{convert|36|km|mi}} east of [[Gubbio]] (both in [[Umbria]]). Its location on the main highway and rail line from Umbria to the [[Adriatic]] make it a mid-sized regional center in the [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]]. Fabriano is the headquarters of the giant appliance maker [[Indesit]].

Fabriano, with Bologna, is the only Italian [[Creative Cities Network|creative city]] (UNESCO). The town is in the category ''Folk Arts''  (for the Fabriano's handmade paper production).

==History==
Fabriano appears to have been founded in the early Middle Ages by the inhabitants of a small Roman town {{convert|5|km|mi|0}} south at Attiggio (Latin ''Attidium''), of which some slight remains and inscriptions are extant. Fabriano itself was one of the earliest places in Europe to make high-quality [[paper]] on an industrial scale, starting in the 13th century, and the town even today has a reputation for fine [[watermark]]ed paper. This led to Fabriano's prosperity in the [[Late Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]], and was also one of the factors that led to the establishment of nearby [[Foligno]] in Umbria as one of the earliest printing centers in Italy in the 15th century, from 1470 onwards.

==Geography==
The municipality borders with [[Cerreto d'Esi]], [[Costacciaro]] ([[Province of Perugia|PG]]), [[Esanatoglia]] ([[Province of Macerata|MC]]), [[Fiuminata]] (MC), [[Fossato di Vico]] (PG), [[Genga, Marche|Genga]], [[Gualdo Tadino]] (PG), [[Matelica]] (MC), [[Nocera Umbra]] (PG), [[Poggio San Vicino]] (MC), [[Sassoferrato]], [[Serra San Quirico]] and [[Sigillo]] (PG).&lt;ref&gt;{{OSM|r|42382|Fabriano}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Frazioni''===

==Main sights==
Fabriano's wealth and commitment to the fine arts in the late medieval period have left it with many monuments.

===Churches===
*[[Fabriano Cathedral]], dedicated to San Venanzio ([[Venantius of Camerino|Saint Venantius]]) (14th century, rebuilt in 1607&amp;ndash;17). From the Baroque restoration are the stucco decoration of the interior and the canvasses by [[Gregorio Preti]], [[Salvator Rosa]], [[Giovanni Francesco Guerrieri]], [[Giuseppe Puglia]] and [[Orazio Gentileschi]]. To the original Cathedral belong the polygonal apse, the cloister and the St Lawrence Chapel with frescoes by [[Allegretto di Nuzio]] (c. 1360). Also important are the frescoes with ''Stories of the True Cross'' by the [[Foligno|Folignate]] painter [[Giovanni di Corraduccio]] (1415).
*[[San Filippo Neri, Fabriano|San Filippo Neri]] - Church in 14th century attached to hospital, converted to oratory of the Philippines in 1628&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZodX9S-tijQC Guida e statistica della città e Comune di Fabriano], (1874); page 163.&lt;/ref&gt;
*San Domenico
*[[San Biagio and San Romualdo, Fabriano|Santi Biagio e Romualdo]]&lt;ref&gt;Guida, page 155-156.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Sant'Onofrio, Fabriano|Sant'Onofrio]] - Church rebuilt in 1727&lt;ref&gt;Guida, page 159.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other buildings===
[[File:Fabriano.municipales 2007.jpg|thumb|240px|Palazzo del Podestà.]]
*''Palazzo del Podestà'' (1255) built in white stone from Vallemontagnana and subsequently modified several times. It has a distinctive bridge structure, a memory of the stream which once flowed under it. The central arcade has frescoes from the 13th-14th centuries portraying warriors, and an enigmatic [[Rota Fortunae|Wheel of Fortune]] moved by a feminine figure.
*Sturinalto Fountain  (1285), designed by [[Jacopo di Grondolo]], who was inspired by the [[Fontana Maggiore, Perugia|Fontana Maggiore in Perugia]].
*Communal Palace  (c. 1350, rebuilt in 1690). It was the residence of the Chiavelli family, lords of the city until 1435. In the courtyard is a ''lapidarium'' with fragments of buildings of the ancient Roman cities of ''Attidium'' ([[Attiggio]]), ''Tuficum'' ([[Borgo Tufico]]) and ''[[Sentinum]]'' ([[Sassoferrato]]).
*[[Pinacoteca Civica Bruno Malajoli]] displayed in the former Hospital (Spedale di Santa Maria del Buon Gesù) - The hospital was first built in 1456. The art collection of the Pinacoteca were moved here in 1994. The collection contains works by [[Rainaldetto di Ranuccio]] of Spoleto, [[Master of San Agostino]], [[Master of San Emiliano]], Master of the Magi ([[Fra Giovanni di Bartolomeo]]), [[Maestro dei Beati Becchetti]], [[Puccio di Simone]], [[Allegretto Nuzi]], [[Francescuccio di Cecco Ghissi]], [[Master of Fossato]], [[Master of San Verecondo]], [[Ottaviano Nelli]], [[Master of Staffolo]], [[Antonio da Fabriano]], [[Bicci di Lorenzo]], [[Neri di Bicci]]; [[Bernardino di Mariotto]], [[Filippo da Verona]], [[Venanzio da Camerino]] and [[Piergentile da Matelica]], [[Simone de Magistris]], [[Domiziano Domiziani]], [[Girolamo Nardini|Girolamo]] or [[Giacomo Nardini]], [[Andrea Boscoli]], [[Orazio Gentileschi]], [[Ambrogio Monaco]], [[Francesco Podesti]], and [[Gentile da Fabriano]].

In [[linguistics]], a '''feature'''  is the assignment of [[wiktionary:binary|binary]] or [[unary operation|unary]] conditions which act as constraints.{{what|date=January 2015}}

==In phonology==
{{main|distinctive feature}}
In [[phonology]], [[segment (linguistics)|segment]]s are categorized into [[natural class]]es on the basis of their [[distinctive feature]]s. Each feature is a quality or characteristic of the natural class, such as [[Voice (phonetics)|voice]] or [[manner of articulation|manner]]. A unique combination of features defines a [[phoneme]].

Examples of [[phonemic]] or distinctive features are: [+/- [[Voice (phonetics)|voice]] ], [+/- [[Advanced tongue root|ATR]] ] (binary features) and [ [[coronal consonant|CORONAL]] ] (a unary feature; also a [[place of articulation|place]] feature).

Surface representations can be expressed as the result of rules acting on the features of the [[underlying representation]]. These rules are formulated in terms of transformations on features.

==In morphology==
In [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] and [[syntax]], words are often organized into '''[[lexical category|lexical categories]]''' or '''word classes''', such as "noun", "verb", "adjective", and so on. These word classes have '''[[grammatical category|grammatical feature]]s''' (also called ''categories'' or ''inflectional categories''), which can have one of a set of potential '''values''' (also called the ''property'', ''meaning'', or ''feature'' of the category).&lt;ref&gt;Kibort, Anna &amp; Corbett, Greville G. [http://www.grammaticalfeatures.net/inventory.html Grammatical Features - Feature Inventory]&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, consider the [[pronoun]] in English. Pronouns are a ''lexical category''. Pronouns have the [[grammatical person|person]] ''feature'', which can have a ''value'' of "first", "second", or "third". English pronouns also have the [[grammatical number|number]] ''feature'', which can have a value of either "singular" or "plural". As a result, we can describe the English pronoun "they" as a pronoun with [person:3] and [number:plural].

==In semantics==
{{main|semantic feature}}
In [[semantics]], words are categorized into [[semantic class]]es. Intersecting semantic classes share the same [[semantic feature]]s.

{{History of the Philippines}}
{{Vajrayana}}
The '''Golden Tara''' is a 1.79 kilogram, 21 carat [[Majapahit]] period gold image of a Hindu goddess discovered in [[Esperanza, Agusan]] in 1918. When it was purchased by the Field Museum of Chicago, they renamed it as '''Agusan Gold Image''', though this name is rejected by scholars in the Philippines.

[[H. Otley Beyer]] believed that the image was that of a [[Hindu]] [[Shaivism|Sivaite goddess]], but with the religiously important hand signals improperly copied by local workmen.  Thus it suggests that Hinduism was already in the Philippines before [[Ferdinand Magellan]] arrived, but also suggests that the early Filipinos had an imperfect version of Hinduism which they got from the Majapahit.

{{Quote|A study of this image was made by Dr. F. D. K. Bosch, of Batavia, in 1920, who came to the conclusion that it was made by local workmen in Mindanao, copying a [[Nganjuk Regency|Nganjuk]] images of the early Majapahit period - except that the local artist overlooked the distinguishing attributes held in the hand. It probably had some connection with the Javanese miners who are known to have been mining gold in the Agusan-Surigao area in the middle or late 14th century. The image is apparently that of a Sivaite goddess, and fits in well with the name "Butuan" (signifying "phallus").|[[H. Otley Beyer]]|1947&lt;ref name=ob&gt;H. Otley Beyer, "Outline Review of Philippine Archaeology by Islands and Provinces," Philippine Journal of Science, Vol.77,Nos.34 (July–August 1947),pp. 205-374&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After its discovery in 1918 by a [[Manobo]] woman named Bilay Campos, it was stolen while being safeguarded inside a hidden chest inside her traditional Manobo house. Before being stolen, the tribe of Manobos, where Campos belonged to, viewed the Golden Tara as a ''diwata'', a nature spirit deemed to protect the vastness of their ancestral domain's rainforests and waterways. Later on, the artifact would land in the possession of the area's governor for unknown links. The artifact would later be sold in a multinational company, where the governor was indebted to with a large sum of money. For unknown reasons, the artifact eventually landed for auction, prompting H. Otley Beyer to demand the Philippine government to buy the artifact for the sake of the [[National Museum of the Philippines]] and the Philippine nation. However, during that time, the country was in deep financial constraint, and was unable to buy the artifact. The Golden Tara was purchased by the [[Field Museum of Natural History]] of Chicago, Illinois in 1922 for a sum of approximately 4,000 pesos. According to the Field Museum, the artifact was purchased to save it from being melted at the time because the Philippines was having a hard time with its finances, which may have led to the minting of the artifact to aid in the country's financial losses. The purchase was funded through a campaign in Chicago to buy the artifact, with the aid of the American government, which at the time was also the colonial government in the Philippines. By 2010, the artifact's price has risen to approximately 1.5 million Philippine pesos.

[[File:Golden Tara - panoramio (1).jpg|thumb|left|A statue of the Golden Tara in [[Butuan]]]]
The artifact has been a source of conflict between Filipinos and Americans for many years as many Filipino scholars have demanded for the return of the Golden Tara, as it is a national treasure of the country, unreported during the time of discovery, and sold to Americans during a great financial loss to the country - the very reason why the Philippine government at the time was not able to buy the artifact when it was auctioned. Scholars have argued that if the reason why the Field Museum took the artifact was because they fear that it may have been melted down, why has the Field Museum not returned or at least let the Philippines buy the artifact back since no group in the Philippines advocates for its melting anymore. On top of the argument is the cunning way the artifact was bought by an American museum during a time when the Philippines was in financial constraint under the colonial government of America. One of the major protesters for the return of the Golden Tara to Philippine possession is former senator [[Aquilino Pimentel Jr.]], who made his last privilege speech in the Senate specifically for the purpose of returning the Golden Tara to the Philippines. The Field Museum in Chicago has said that it may return the Golden Tara if it is 'strongly requested' by the Philippine government. In April 2018, a documentary from GMA Network featured the Golden Tara again, this time showing the people of [[Agusan del Sur]] supporting the return of the Golden Tara into the Philippines. Scholars have also found the document proving the right to claim of the Philippines on the Golden Tara. The scholars, in partnership with the government, have been tasked to pursue the Philippine claim on the Golden Tara, housed in the Field Museum in Chicago, United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://philippines.fieldmuseum.org/heritage/narrative/4820|title=Agusan Gold Vajralasya|work=Philippine Heritage Collection|publisher=[[Field Museum of Natural History]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Herbchronology''' is the analysis of annual [[growth rings]] (or simply annual rings) in the secondary root [[xylem]] of [[perennial]] [[herbaceous plants]]. While leaves and stems of perennial herbs die down at the end of the growing season the root often persists for many years or even the entire life.&lt;ref name="JBRCDB2002"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Dietz H, Schweingruber FH |title=Annual rings in native and introduced forbs of lower Michigan, USA
 |journal=Canadian Journal of Botany|volume=80|year=2002|pages=642–649|doi=10.1139/b02-048}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perennial herb species belonging to the [[dicotyledon]] group (also known as perennial [[forbs]]) are characterized by [[secondary growth]], which shows as a new [[growth ring]] added each year to persistent roots. About two thirds of all perennial dicotyledonous herb species with a persistent root that grow in the strongly seasonal zone of the northern hemisphere show at least fairly clear annual  growth rings.&lt;ref name="JBRCDB2002" /&gt;

Counting of annual growth rings can be used to determine the age of a perennial herb similarly as it is done in trees using [[dendrochronology]].&lt;ref name="PB2006"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=von Arx G, Dietz H |title=Growth rings in the roots of temperate forbs are robust annual markers|journal=Plant Biology|volume=8|year=2006|pages=224–233|doi=10.1055/s-2005-873051}}&lt;/ref&gt; This way it was found that some perennial herbs live up to 50 years and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Growth rings in herbs and shrubs: life span, age determination and stem anatomy|vauthors=Schweingruber FH, Poschlod P |pages=195–415|year=2005|issn=1424-5108|publisher=Haupt|location=Bern}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ECO2006"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=von Arx G, Edwards PJ, Dietz H |title=Evidence for life history changes in high altitude populations of three perennial forbs|journal=Ecology|volume=87|year=2006|pages=665–674|doi=10.1890/05-1041}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term herb-chronology is referring to [[dendrochronology]] because of the similarity of the structures investigated. The term was introduced in the late 1990s,&lt;ref name="AB1998"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Dietz H, Ullmann I |title=Ecological application of 'Herbchronology': Comparative stand age structure analyses of the invasive plant Bunias orientalis L.|journal=Annals of Botany|volume=82|year=1998|pages=471–480|doi=10.1006/anbo.1998.0706}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the existence of annual rings in perennial herbs was already observed in earlier times by several researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Petersen HE|title=Diapensiaceae|journal=Meddelelser am Gronland|volume=36|year=1908|pages=141–154}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Zoller H|title=Beitrag zur Altersbestimmung von Pflanzen aus der Walliser Felsensteppe|journal=Bericht über das Geobotanische Forschungsinstitut Rübel in Zürich|year=1949|pages=61–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Bakshi TS, Coupland RT |title=Vegetative propagation in Linaria vulgaris|journal=Journal of Botany|volume=38|year=1960|pages=243–249|doi=10.1139/b60-022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Annual growth rings==
Like trees and woody plants, perennial herbs have a growth zone called [[vascular cambium]] between the root bark and the root [[xylem]]. The [[vascular cambium ring]] is active during growing season and produces a new layer of [[xylem]] tissue or growth ring every year. This addition of a new lateral layer each year is called [[secondary growth]] and is exactly the same as in woody plants. Each individual growth ring consists of [[Wood#Earlywood and latewood in softwood|earlywood]] tissue that is formed at the beginning of the growing season and [[Wood#Earlywood and latewood in softwood|latewood]] tissue formed in summer and fall. Earlywood tissue is characterized by wide [[vessel element|vessels]] or denser arrangement of vessels, whereas latewood tissue shows narrower vessels and/or lower vessel density.&lt;ref name="JBRCDB2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PB2006" /&gt;

Annual growth rings in herbs are usually only visible by means of a microscope and a specific staining method. Ring-like patterns visible in roots cross sections by the naked eye may be false rings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Werner PA|title=On the determination of age in Liatris aspera using cross-sections of corms: implications for past demographic studies|journal=The American Naturalist|volume=112|year=1978|pages=1113–1120|doi=10.1086/283350}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The width of annual growth rings depends on conditions during formation; in a favorable year it is wider and in a less favorable year narrower.&lt;ref name="ECO2005"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Dietz H, von Arx G |title=Climatic fluctuation causes large-scale synchronous variation in radial increments of the main roots of northern hemisphere forbs|journal=Ecology|volume=86|year=2005|pages=327–333|doi=10.1890/04-0801}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Herbchronology is used in many fields of ecological and biological research, for instance in  [[community ecology]], [[population biology]], [[plant ecology]] and [[Invasion biology terminology|invasion biology]].

Herbchronology is used as a tool to estimate plant age. This may be relevant information to determine :
*… the longevity of a perennial [[herbaceous plant]] species; this is valuable information for flora books and an important aspect of life history strategy of a species.&lt;ref name="ECO2006"/&gt;
*… the population age structure; this is valuable for questions into population dynamics or the spreading patterns of invasive species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Dietz H|title=Plant invasion patches - reconstructing pattern and process by means of herb-chronology|journal=Biological Invasions|volume=4|year=2002|pages=211–222|doi=10.1023/a:1020971509871 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Moloney KA, Knaus F, Dietz H |title=Evidence for a shift in life-history strategy during the secondary phase of a plant invasion|journal=Biological Invasions|volume=11|year=2009|pages=625–634|doi=10.1007/s10530-008-9277-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Herbchronology allows to assess long-term annual growth rates of a perennial [[herbaceous plant]] without having to monitor it. This may be relevant information to assess …
*… the impact of fluctuations in specific climatic conditions on growth.&lt;ref name="ECO2005" /&gt;
*… the impact of changes in site conditions such as competition.&lt;ref name="AB1998" /&gt;
*… lifetime growth patterns.&lt;ref name="ECO2006" /&gt;

The next step (from spectra to imaging) was proposed by [[Vladislav Ivanov (physicist)|Vladislav Ivanov]] in  [[Soviet Union]],  who filed in 1960 a patent application for a Magnetic Resonance Imaging device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=MacWilliams B|date=November 2003|title=Russian claims first in magnetic imaging|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v426/n6965/full/426375a.html|journal=Nature|volume=426|issue=6965|page=375|bibcode=2003Natur.426..375M|doi=10.1038/426375a|pmid=14647349}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050817144026/http://www.inauka.ru/science/article36826 ПРИВЕТ НОБЕЛЮ ОТ ИВАНОВА]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findpatent.ru/byauthors/849010/ Patents by Ivan Vladislav]&lt;/ref&gt; Ivanov's main contribution was the idea of  using magnetic field gradient, combined with a selective frequency excitation/readout, to encode the spatial coordinates. 
In modern terms, it was only proton-density (not relaxation times) imaging, which was also slow since, only one gradient direction was used at a time and the imaging had to be done slice-by-slice. Nevertheless, it was a true Magnetic Resonance Imaging procedure that finds a limited use even today. Originally rejected as "improbable", Ivanov's application was finally approved in 1984 (with the original priority date), &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inauka.ru/english/article36919.html|title=Best Regards to Alfred Nobel|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091213045234/http://www.inauka.ru/english/article36919.html|archivedate=2009-12-13|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2009-10-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

By 1959, Jay Singer had studied blood flow by NMR relaxation time measurements of blood in living humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Singer RJ | title = Blood-flow rates by NMR measurements | journal = Science | volume = 130 | issue = 3389| pages = 1652–1653 | date = 1959 |pmid=17781388| doi =  10.1126/science.130.3389.1652| bibcode =1959Sci...130.1652S  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="emrf" /&gt; Such measurements were not introduced into common medical practice until the mid-1980s, although a patent for a whole-body NMR machine to measure blood flow in the human body was already filed by Alexander Ganssen in early 1967.&lt;ref name="History of MRI"&gt;[http://magnetic-resonance.org/ch/20-03.html History of MRI]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="emrf" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Patent|de|1566148}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.siemens.com/history/en/news/1204_magnetom.htm First MAGNETOM scanner in the USA in 1983]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pro-physik.de/details/articlePdf/1492009/issue.html Nachruf auf Alexander Ganssen]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s and 1970s the results of a very large amount of work on relaxation, diffusion, and chemical exchange of water in cells and tissues of various types appeared in the scientific literature.&lt;ref name="History of MRI"/&gt; In 1967, Ligon reported the measurement of NMR relaxation of water in the arms of living human subjects.&lt;ref name="History of MRI"/&gt; In 1968, Jackson and Langham published the first NMR signals from a living animal, an anesthetized rat.&lt;ref name="History of MRI"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author =Jackson JA | author2=Langham WH | title = Whole-body NMR spectrometer | journal =[[Review of Scientific Instruments]] | volume =39 | issue =4 | pages = 510–513 | date =April 1968 | pmid =5641806   | doi =  10.1063/1.1683420| bibcode =1968RScI...39..510J  | url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc1032131/ | format=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Damadian invention.jpg|thumb|right|Raymond Damadian's "Apparatus and method for detecting cancer in tissue"]]
In a March 1971 paper in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Damadian R | title = Tumor detection by nuclear magnetic resonance | journal = Science | volume = 171 | issue = 3976 | pages = 1151–3 | date = March 1971 | pmid = 5544870 | doi = 10.1126/science.171.3976.1151 | bibcode = 1971Sci...171.1151D }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Raymond Damadian]], an Armenian-American doctor and professor at the Downstate Medical Center [[State University of New York]] (SUNY), reported that [[tumor]]s and normal tissue can be distinguished in vivo by nuclear magnetic resonance ("NMR"). He suggested that these differences could be used to diagnose [[cancer]], though later research would find that these differences, while real, are too variable for diagnostic purposes. Damadian's initial methods were flawed for practical use,&lt;ref name="SydneyMorningHerald"&gt;{{cite news | title = The man who did not win | date = 2003-10-17 | url = http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/10/16/1065917548433.html | publisher = Sydney Morning Herald | accessdate = 2007-08-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; relying on a point-by-point scan of the entire body and using relaxation rates, which turned out not to be an effective indicator of cancerous tissue.&lt;ref name="wallstjournal"&gt;{{cite news | title = Scan and Deliver | date = 2002-06-14 | url = http://opinionjournal.com/taste/?id=110001844l | publisher = Wall Street Journal | accessdate = 2007-08-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While researching the analytical properties of magnetic resonance, Damadian created a hypothetical magnetic resonance cancer-detecting machine in 1972. He filed the first patent for such a machine, {{US patent|3789832}} on March 17, 1972, which was later issued to him on February 5, 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Apparatus And Method For Detecting Cancer In Tissue|publisher=United States Patent and Trademark Office|url=http://www.google.com/patents?id=--AZAAAAEBAJ&amp;printsec=abstract#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lawrence Bennett and Dr. Irwin Weisman also found in 1972 that neoplasms display different relaxation times than corresponding normal tissue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nist.gov/director/nist-culture-excellence-article-9|title=NBS Examines a Mouse and Opens a New Medical Specialty|last=Schooley|first=Jim|date=2010|website=NIST|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weisman|first=I.

During the 1970s a team led by [[John Mallard]] built the first full-body MRI scanner at the [[University of Aberdeen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Celebrated scientist donates medal collection |url = http://www.abdn.ac.uk/news/3095/ |author = University of Aberdeen}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 August 1980 they used this machine to obtain the first clinically useful image of a patient's internal tissues using MRI, which identified a primary tumour in the patient's chest, an abnormal liver, and secondary cancer in his bones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=JOHN MALLARD |url = http://www.bshr.org.uk/mallard.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; This machine was later used at [[St Bartholomew's Hospital]], in London, from 1983 to 1993.

In 1975, the [[University of California, San Francisco]] Radiology Department founded the Radiologic Imaging Laboratory (RIL).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ucsfcat.library.ucsf.edu/record=b1446128~S0|title=UCSF Library|website=ucsf.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the support of Pfizer, Diasonics, and later Toshiba America MRI, the lab developed new imaging technology and installed systems in the US and worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt3199s1qf/admin/#ref732 Lawrence Crooks Radiologic Imaging Laboratory Records&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981 RIL researchers, including Leon Kaufman and [[Lawrence Crooks]], published ''Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Medicine''.

In 1980 [[Paul Bottomley (scientist)|Paul Bottomley]] joined the GE Research Center in Schenectady, New York. His team ordered the highest field-strength magnet then available, a 1.5&amp;nbsp;T system, and built the first high-field device, overcoming problems of coil design, RF penetration and signal-to-noise ratio to build the first whole-body MRI/MRS scanner.&lt;ref name=sijbers_snr&gt;{{cite journal | author = Sijbers J | author2 = Scheunders P | author3 = Bonnet N | author4 = Van Dyck D | author5 = Raman E | title = Quantification and improvement of the signal-to-noise ratio in a magnetic resonance image acquisition procedure | journal = Magn Reson Imaging | volume = 14 | issue = 10 | pages = 1157–63 | date = 1996 | pmid = 9065906 | doi = 10.1016/S0730-725X(96)00219-6 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.20.3169 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The results translated into the highly successful 1.5&amp;nbsp;T MRI product-line, with over 20,000 systems in use today{{When|date=January 2016}}.

Although MRI is most commonly performed in the clinic at 1.5 T, higher fields such as 3 T for clinical imaging and more recently 7 T for research purposes are gaining more popularity because of their increased sensitivity and resolution.  In research laboratories, human studies have been performed at up to 9.4 T&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | display-authors = 9 | author = Vaughan T | author2 = DelaBarre L | author3 = Snyder C | author4 = Tian J | author5 = Akgun C | author6 = Shrivastava D | author7 = Liu W | author8 =  Olson C | author9 = Adriany G | author10 = Strupp J | author11 = Andersen P | author12 = Gopinath A | author13 = van de Moortele PF | author14 = Garwood M | author15 = Ugurbil K | title = 9.4T human MRI: preliminary results | journal = Magn Reson Med | volume = 56 | issue = 6 | pages = 1274–82 | date = December 2006 | pmid = 17075852 | doi = 10.1002/mrm.21073 | pmc=4406343}}&lt;/ref&gt; and animal studies have been performed at up to 21.1 T.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Qian C | author2 = Masad IS | author3 = Rosenberg JT | author4 = Elumalai M | author5 = Brey WW | author6 = Grant SC | author7 = Gor'kov PL | title = A volume birdcage coil with an adjustable sliding tuner ring for neuroimaging in high field vertical magnets: ex and in vivo applications at 21.1T | journal = J.

==2003 Nobel Prize==

Reflecting the fundamental importance and applicability of MRI in medicine, [[Paul Lauterbur]] of the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] and [[Peter Mansfield|Sir Peter Mansfield]] of the [[University of Nottingham]] were awarded the 2003 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for their "discoveries concerning magnetic resonance imaging". The Nobel citation acknowledged Lauterbur's insight of using magnetic field gradients to determine spatial localization, a discovery that allowed rapid acquisition of 2D images. Mansfield was credited with introducing the mathematical formalism and developing techniques for efficient gradient utilization and fast imaging. The actual research that won the prize was done almost 30 years before while Paul Lauterbur was a professor in the Department of Chemistry at [[Stony Brook University]] in [[New York (state)|New York]].&lt;ref name="lauterbur"/&gt;

[[File:ICHR logo.svg|thumb|200px|right|Logo of Indian Council of Historical Research]]

The '''Indian Council of Historical Research''' ('''ICHR''') is an autonomous body of the [[Ministry of Human Resource Development]], which had been established by an Administrative Order of the then Ministry of Education. The body, over many years, has provided financial assistance to the historians and direction to the research scholars in their multifarious topics of historical research through established historians and scholars of the country.

ICHR disburses funds for carrying out research to Indian as well as foreign scholars on their applications for fellowships, grants, and symposia, made to the Indian Council of Historical Research or through the Ministry of Human Resource Development.

The source of the funds at the disposal of the ICHR is grants-in-aid received from the [[Department of Higher Education (India)|Department of Higher Education]] in the [[Ministry of Human Resource Development (India)|Ministry of Human Resource Development]], grants-in-aid from various Indian states,  private donations from individuals and other countries, and the proceeds of revenues from the sale of publications of the ICHR.

The ICHR has a rich corpus of funds which has been continued to be deposited with UCO Bank at Ferozeshah Road, New Delhi. It is the only academic institution which chose to keep its deposit with a non-state bank of India.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Based in Delhi with regional centers in Bengaluru (Karnataka) and Guwahati (Assam), the Indian Council for Historical Research has served the scholar community. The Regional Center of the ICHR at Bengaluru was established by eminent liberal historian Professor S Settar, the then Chairman of ICHR, and the then Director of ICHR, Dr Sushil Kumar. The Regional Center at Gauhati was established at the instance of the Minister of State hailing from Assam commenced functioning in the library wing of Guwahati University. 

The Government of India has entered into cultural exchange programmes with many countries of the world for an exchange of historians and exchange of views between them.

The ICHR was formed as a literary and charitable society, a fully funded autonomous body of the Ministry of Education with the historians [[Ram Sharan Sharma|R.S. Sharma]] the then Head Department of History, Delhi University, nominated as its first chairman, ICHR,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = The man who made history | url = http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-08-22/patna/29913974_1_r-s-sharma-indian-history-vedic |date=Aug 22, 2011| accessdate = 2013-08-09| work = The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Satish Chandra]], J.S. Garewal and M.N. Prasad, the then the Director of the [[National Archives of India]] at the helm. The present Chairman of ICHR Professor Sudershan Rao is an eminent historian and member secretary is Dr. Anand Shanker Singh &lt;ref&gt;http://ichr.ac.in/about_comp_council.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the notable historian members/functionaries of the Indian Council have been [[Irfan Habib]], [[Sushil Kumar (scholar)|Sushil Kumar]], [[Tapan Raychaudhuri]], and [[Barun De]].

==Review of the functioning of ICHR==

Since the ICHR has continued to be fully funded by the government of India, and all the administrative and fiscal policies of the government are applicable to its affairs, the government of India carries out a periodical review of the functioning of ICHR.

The first review of the ICHR was ordered in 1981, the second in 1999, and the third in March 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mhrd.gov.in/sites/upload_files/mhrd/files/document-reports/Report-ICHR.pdf Third review of the ICHR - March 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objectives==
The objectives of the ICHR, as enunciated in the initial pamphlet published by the Department of Education, Government of India in 1972,{{full citation needed|date=January 2018}} are as under:

* to bring historians together and provide a forum for exchange of views between them;
* to give a national direction to an objective and scientific writing of history and to have rational presentation and interpretation of history;
* to promote, accelerate and coordinate research in history with special emphasis on areas which have not received adequate attention so far;
* to promote and coordinated a balanced distribution of research effort over different areas; and
* to elicit support and recognition for historical research from all concerned and ensure the necessary dissemination and use of results.

==Funding, expenses and salaries==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2015}}

ICHR, as mentioned above, is fully funded by grants-in-aid received from the Department of Higher Education, Ministry of Human Resource Development. ICHR also receives funds from the various state governments of India, also from other Ministries of the government of India. The government has signed Cultural Exchange Programs (CEP) with many countries with the exception of the US and the UK.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} The host countries provide funds to the Scholars visiting under CEP.

The audit of the funds/grants-in aid in respect of the ICHR is regularly carried out by the Director General of Audit and Central Revenue (DGA&amp;CR). The audit replies are required to be furnished by a permanent incumbent and the senior-most regular employee of the Council viz the Director, Indian Council of Historical Research.

A copy of the Yearly Audit Report is also marked to the Secretary, Department of Higher Education as also the replies of the Audit Paras/observations.

== Fellowships and grants ==
There is no deadline for submitting applications for fellowships and Grants from the ICHR. These are received throughout the year. However the meetings of the Research Grant Committees are held at regular intervals, after the receipt of the expert opinions upon the submitted applications as to the viability of a research project and/or symposia on the convenience of its chairman. The details of the fellowships and grants made by the ICHR are:

* Junior Research Fellowship
* General (Post-Doctoral) Fellowship
* Senior Research Fellowship
* Research Project
* Contingency (Study-cum-Travel) Grant
* Foreign Travel Grant
* Publication Subsidy
* Seminar/Workshop/Conference Grant
* National Fellowship
* Senior Academic Fellowship
* Publication Subsidy
* Grant for holding Seminar and Conferences.

==Office building==
The ICHR, unlike its sister research body, the Indian Council of Social Science Research, which had been formed by an Act of the Parliament, has no office building of its own. It has continued to be housed in a building belonging to the Jawaharlal Nehru University, at 35 Ferozeshah Road, New Delhi, since 1972.

==Organization==
The organization of the ICHR is headed by the Honorary Chairman with the Member Secretary functions as the Secretary of the Governing Council of ICHR during its General Body and specially called for meetings. The Member Secretary, ICHR is functions as the day to day Head of the Department in ICHR.

The Members of the Council of ICHR (Governing Body) are nominated for a period of three Years. The Chairman of the Council of ICHR is nominated by the Department of Education in an honorary capacity and his term is not co-terminus with that of the members of the Constituted Council. The day-to-day functioning of the ICHR is looked after the Director who acts as '' ex officio'' Member Secretary of the Council. In 1991, a trend was started to have a separate post of Member Secretary of the ICHR, with Professor MGS Narayanan being selected as the First Member Secretary of ICHR. The institution has been continually embroiled in intra-rivalries between the Chairmen, Member Secretaries and the Directors, at the cost of historical research. The main reason, as per many, has been the deputing of persons from here and there as the Member Secretaries and the undermining the office of the Chairman and the Director of the institution.

== Personal life and activism ==

In an interview with the [[Montreal Gazette]], and with Être, Bastien-Charlebois describes the medical "normalization" of her body at age 17 as a process of dispossession.&lt;ref name="mg"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Bastien-Charlebois| first = Janik| title = My coming out: The lingering intersex taboo| work = [[Montreal Gazette]] | date = 2015-08-09| url = http://montrealgazette.com/life/my-coming-out-the-lingering-intersex-taboo | accessdate = 2016-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="etre" /&gt;&lt;ref name="led" /&gt; Her activism began slowly following a meeting with Curtis Hinkle, the founder of [[Organisation Intersex International]], in Montreal in 2005.&lt;ref name="mg" /&gt; She has participated in the second and third [[International Intersex Forum]]s.&lt;ref name = "ilga" /&gt;

== Career ==

Janik Bastien-Charlebois is a professor in the Department of Sociology at the Université du Québec à Montréal, where she works in research groups on "Testimonial Cultures", homophobia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://chairehomophobie.uqam.ca/recherche/chercheur-e-s/chercheur-e-s-associes/23-janik-bastien-charlebois-ph-d.html | title = Janik BASTIEN-CHARLEBOIS, Ph.D. | accessdate = 2016-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Institute for Research on Feminist Studies. During 2014 and 2015, Bastien-Charlebois was a visiting scholar at the Centre for Transdisciplinary Gender Studies (Zentrum für transdisziplinäre Geschlechterstudien), [[Humboldt University of Berlin]].&lt;ref name = "hub" /&gt;

Her book, ''La virilité en jeu (Manhood at stake)'', examines the inevitability of boys' homophobic behaviors through interviews with adolescent boys. Bastien-Charlebois disputes arguments focused on human nature and male identity formation, suggesting instead that heterosexuality is socially constructed.&lt;ref name="sept"&gt;{{cite book | title = La virilité en jeu | url = http://www.septentrion.qc.ca/catalogue/virilite-en-jeu-la | isbn = 9782894486658 | date = 2011 | publisher = Editions du Septentrion | accessdate = 2016-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent work, Bastien-Charlebois critiques the medical treatment of intersex voices.&lt;ref name="ilga" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite| publisher = Observatoire des Transidentités| last = Bastien-Charlebois| first = Janik| title = De la lourdeur d’écrire un article universitaire sur les enjeux intersexes lorsqu’on est soi-même intersexe| date = September 2, 2016| url = http://www.observatoire-des-transidentites.com/2016/09/de-la-lourdeur-d-ecrire-un-article-universitaire-sur-les-enjeux-intersexes-lorsqu-on-est-soi-meme-intersexe.html | accessdate = 2016-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jewish Autonomism''' was a non-[[Zionism|Zionist]] [[Jewish political movements|political movement]] that emerged in [[Eastern Europe]] in the late 19th and early 20th century. One of its major proponents was the historian and activist [[Simon Dubnow]], who also called his ideology [[Folkspartei|folkism]].

[[Image:SimonDubnow.jpg|thumb|150px|Simon Dubnow]]
The Autonomists believed that the future survival of the [[Jews]] as a [[nation]] depends on their spiritual and cultural strength, in developing "spiritual nationhood" and in viability of [[Jewish diaspora]] as long as Jewish communities maintain [[self-rule]], and rejected [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]]. Autonomists often stressed the vitality of modern [[Yiddish]] culture.

Various concepts of the Autonomism were adopted in the platforms of the [[Folkspartei]], the [[Sejmists]] and [[socialist]] Jewish parties such as the [[General Jewish Labor Union|Bund]].

Some groups blended Autonomism with [[Zionism]]: they favored Jewish self-rule in the diaspora until diaspora Jews make [[Aliyah]] to their national homeland in [[Zion]].

The movement's beliefs were similar to those of the [[Austromarxists]], who advocated [[national personal autonomy]] within the multinational [[Austro-Hungarian empire]], and [[cultural pluralism|cultural pluralists]] in America, such as [[Randolph Bourne]] and [[Horace Kallen]].

In 1941, Simon Dubnow was one of thousands of Jews murdered in the [[Rumbula massacre]]. After [[the Holocaust]], the notion of Autonomism practically disappeared from [[Jewish philosophy]].

It is not connected to the contemporary political movement [[autonomism]].

'''John Fraser''' (1882 &amp;ndash; 18 May 1945) was [[Jesus Professor of Celtic]] at the [[University of Oxford]].

==Life==
He was born in [[Inverness]], [[Scotland]], and studied at the [[University of Aberdeen]], [[Trinity College Cambridge]] and the [[University of Jena]].  After lecturing in [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] at Aberdeen University, he was appointed [[Jesus Professor of Celtic]] in 1921, becoming thereby a [[Oxbridge Fellow|Professorial Fellow]] of [[Jesus College, Oxford]].  He held the position until his death in 1945.

He had a particular research interest in Scottish Gaelic and Scottish place name studies, but left no substantial work beyond his many contributions to learned periodicals.  His papers are now held by Aberdeen University.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120722130348/http://www.archiveshub.ac.uk/news/0508fraser.html Brief biography and details of Fraser's archive at Aberdeen University (accessed 18 February 2007)]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Law and development''' is an [[interdisciplinary]] study of law and economic and [[social development]].  It examines the relation between law and development and analyzes how to use law as an instrument to promote economic and social development.

In the 1960s, some American organizations such as the [[U.S. Agency for International Development]] and the [[Ford Foundation]] sponsored the law reform in [[developing countries]]. Legal scholars from leading American law schools wrote many articles discussing the contribution of law reform to economic development.  This was called the law and development movement. However, after only one decade, both key involved scholars and former [[Ford Foundation]] officials declared this movement failed.&lt;ref&gt;Trubek &amp; Galanter (1974)&lt;/ref&gt;

The presumably failed law and development revived in the 1980s, with the proliferation of law reform projects based on neoliberal ideals. These projects supported liberal reforms such as privatization and trade liberalization, with the emphasis on the rule of law. Substantial investments were made on these projects by international development agencies such as the World Bank, USAID, and other public agencies and private foundations, but these law reform projects were criticized for being ineffective or causing adverse impacts on development in many places in the world. 

The cause of the failure in the first and second law and development movements is that the law reform projects were developed and implemented without sufficient understanding of the mechanism by which LFIs impact economic and social development, which is affected by various socio-economic factors on the ground. &lt;ref&gt;Lee (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;  [http://www.lawanddevelopment.net The Law and Development Institute] was set up in 2009 to promote studies in law and development and develop a comprehensive analytical model for law and development, and the [http://www.degruyter.com/ldr Law and Development Review] was launched in 2008 as the only peer-reviewed academic journal devoted to law and development.

Legal research is the process of identifying and retrieving information to support legal arguments and decisions.&lt;ref&gt;J. Myron Jacobstein and Roy M. Mersky, Fundamentals of Legal Research, 8th ed. (Foundation Press, 2002) p.&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/ref&gt; Finding relevant legal information can be challenging and may involve the use of electronic research tools as well as printed books and materials.  However, many resources that are useful for legal research are fee-based, and many are not easily accessible.

== Process ==
{{prose|date=August 2016}}

There is no one right way to do legal research. There are however practices that have proven to be more efficient and cost effective. A general search strategy might be:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kunz|first1=Christina L.|title=The Process of legal research|date=1986|publisher=Little, Brown|isbn=0316507288|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qhLxAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=25 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* frame the Issue (try to figure out what the case is about/ what legal issue or issues you will need to research)
* brainstorm search terms (think up synonyms - assisted suicide? right to die? euthanasia?)
* determine jurisdiction and time frame (do you have a lot of time to research this?  Usually not.  You may have to make do with a quick and dirty resource instead of an in-depth, ever so scholarly one)
* decide which format to use (print or electronic- this often just depends on what you have access to)
* locate, read, and update secondary sources
* locate read and update primary authority (cases, statutes, and regulations)
* look up rules of procedure, ethics,  non-legal and other materials if needed
* repeat the above steps, as needed, depending on your search results.

You may be able to find a topic-specific research guide by searching online, or from a local library.

==Primary sources==
Primary sources of law are the original sources of the law. Such sources include statutes, government regulations, case law and the text of the state and federal constitutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=How to Perform Legal Research|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/links|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=25 February 2018|date=30 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Judicial branch sources (Cases) ===

The Judicial branch is the court system. Each jurisdiction in the U.S. [[judiciary]] (federal and the fifty states) has any number of [[courts]], usually one of three types:
# a [[trial court]],
# an [[appeals court]],
# a "[[court of last resort]]," often (but not always) known as a Supreme Court.

On the federal level, there is a [[Supreme Court of the United States]], [[United States court of appeals]], and a trial court, which is known as the [[United States district court]].  The federal appellate courts are subdivided into numbered "circuits."  Pennsylvania, for example, is in the jurisdiction of the Third Circuit Court of Appeals.

In general, the decisions of a higher court in a court system may be considered "binding" on the lower courts in that court system.  The decisions of the Supreme court of a particular state are binding on the courts within that state.  However, the decisions of a Pennsylvania state court may or may not be followed by a federal court in the Third Circuit, which includes Pennsylvania.  The status of United States Supreme court opinions is complex, but U.S. Supreme Court decisions are final on both federal disputes and federal issues raised in state courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cohen|first1=Morris L.|last2=Berring|first2=Robert C.|last3=Olson|first3=Kent C.|title=How to find the law|date=1989|publisher=West|isbn=0314743049|page=26|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=81QEAQAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only a small percentage of court decisions are officially published in a print court reporter. The most published decisions are issued by the United States Supreme court.  State trial courts produce the lowest percentage of published cases.  Some courts provide copies of their decisions free on the web while others do not.  Even if they are on the web they seldom go back before 1994, when the web first became popular.  The only exception is with U.S. Supreme Court opinions.

Cases on the web can often be found via the website of the individual court. The [[Supreme Court of the United States]], for example, provides the text of recent opinions on its website.  It is one of the best places to obtain new opinions. The [[United States court of appeals]] and State courts can also be a source of free legal information.

In print, to find the cases, legal researchers use indexes of various types.  Classification systems provide index terms. For example, there may be a category of law, [[torts]] (non-crime injuries to people).  There are many types of torts, or [[cause of action|causes of Action]], such as slander.  These causes of actions have various elements which must be proved to establish a claim (there may also be various defenses).  The general category, the cause of action and the various elements of the cause of action and defenses may all be index terms.  The major [[taxonomic classification|classification]] for finding law cases is the [[West American Digest System]].

The key to using legal indexes is to identify not only the key facts but the legal issues which are central to the case.  Keyword searches in databases may also be a challenge, because people may describe legal concepts in varying ways. "Issue spotting" is a skill that lawyers hone in law school and throughout their careers as they gain experience. For the layperson, reading secondary sources, such as books and journal articles, can help.

Once a case has been found, legal researchers must make sure that it has not been overturned by a higher court. Lawyers use [[citator]]s such as [[Shepard's Citations]] to make sure that their case is still "good law." This process is often known as ''Shepardizing'' after the name of the service. Citators track resources, written at a later point in time, which cite back to a particular case. Because cases cite to related cases, citators can be used to find cases which are on the same topic.  A common research strategy is to use "one good case" to find related cases.

Legal forms can be some of the hardest documents to find because one person may call a form by one name while another person knows it by an entirely different name (neither of which may be the actual, official name of the form).  The same form may be known by a different name in a different jurisdiction.   Law libraries often have many sets of formbooks to search.

Legal researchers may also need the briefs and other background materials connected with a case, which are included in [[docket (court)|docket]] records. Other types of documents may exist in databases which cannot be searched with search engines such as [[Google (search engine)|Google]].  These [[Deep Web (search indexing)|'invisible web']] sources may take time to ferret out.

=== Legislative branch sources (Statutes) ===

Some jurisdictions provide copies of their statutes online while others do not.  You can often find new, or "slip laws" on the web (arranged in chronological order), as well as the subject arrangement of the statutes, known as the codified version, or code. The official code for federal statutes, the ''[[United States Code]]'' is usually one to two years out of date both in print and on the web.  Legal Researchers often use the more timely, commercially published ''United States Code Annotated'' (USCA) or the ''United States Code Service'' (USCS). The USCA is available on [[Westlaw]] while the USCS is available on [[LexisNexis|Lexis]].  They are called 'annotated codes' because they include summaries of cases which interpret the meaning of the statute.  They may also include references to journal articles, legal encyclopedias and other research materials.

In addition to the text of the current law itself, legal researchers may also have to research the background documents connected with the statute, which is known as [[Legislative history]]. Legislative history is used to find what is known as the "legislative intent," or purpose behind statutory language.  Again, legislative history documents may be found both in print in law libraries and government documents libraries,  as well as in online formats such as [[LexisNexis|Lexis]] and [[Westlaw]].

[[THOMAS]] the [[Library of Congress]] legislative information service, provides the fulltext of proposed [[Bill (law)|bill]]s, bill status information (did it become a public law?  who sponsored it? what committee was it referred to?), the text of debates from the ''Congressional Record'', the full text of committee reports and other legislative information. The Library of Congress provides access to legislative documents from 1774 through 1875 as part of its [[American Memory]] Project Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation'' digital library.

=== Executive branch sources (Regulations) ===

A legislature usually has neither the time nor the expertise to administer all of the details of a particular statute.  It may, for example, pass a statute mandating clean water.  However, it delegates the authority to actually implement the statute to a [[Government agency]], such as the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]. Agencies issue administrative [[Regulations]] to implement the details of the "enabling legislation" that gave the agency authority to act.

The challenge with the executive branch is to track down the rules and regulations of federal and state administrative agencies. Luckily administrative regulations have a "life cycle" that is very similar to that of statutes. Regulations start out as an agency document, which many agencies now post on the web.  Similar to statutes, regulations are often published in chronological order in ''registers'', and finally are published in subject order in ''codes''.

Federal regulations, for example, are first printed in the [[Federal Register]], before they are published in subject order in the [[Code of Federal Regulations]].

Because of this "publication pattern" in order to find out if there has been a change with respect to a particular regulation a print CFR user has to go through a two step process of checking 1) the List of Sections Affected (LSA) and 2) the latest issue of the Federal Register for the current month.  The [[United States Government Printing Office]] has an e-CFR pilot project is underway to provide a version of the CFR without having to refer to a separate publication for updates.

The foremost executive branch entity is, of course, the Office of [[President of the United States]].  The [[White House]] has its own website. Presidential documents are published in the Federal Register and in [[Title 3 of the Code of Federal Regulations]] (CFR). Presidential documents can also be accessed in the Weekly Compilation of Presidential Documents and the [[Public Papers of the Presidents]] available in print and at the [[United States Government Printing Office]] website.

The relationship between statutes and regulations means that one can usually never consider just a regulation alone.  This intertwined grouping of regulations, statutes, and cases is often best deciphered using secondary sources such as books and journal articles.

== Secondary sources ==

Legal reference books and journal articles are available at some public libraries and at law school libraries. In [[law libraries]] books known as "legal treatises" are available that summarize the law on specific subjects. Law school libraries also hold [[legal encyclopedia]]s, such as [[Corpus Juris Secundum]] or [[American Jurisprudence]] and resources such as [[American Law Reports]]. Many major legal research materials may be found online, through both free and commercial services. [[Law dictionary|Law dictionaries]] can be found in many libraries, online commercial services, and some are free on the Internet.

Many [[law review]]s, other legal journals and magazines, and legal newspapers place content on the web. Not all law journals provide their text on the web, and some content may be placed behind a paywall.

== Legal citation ==

[[Legal citation]]s direct readers to the source of information cited within a legal document.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Legal Citation Guides/Authorities (U.S. Based)|url=https://guides.library.harvard.edu/c.php?g=309930&amp;p=2070190|website=Harvard Law School Library|accessdate=25 February 2018|date=24 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; When conducting legal research, part of the challenge is to figure out how to cite to items, or how to decipher a legal citation encountered in a primary or secondary source. The [[Case citation#Vendor neutral citations|vendor neutral citation movement]] has developed to try to make citations more broadly understandable without specific reference to a particular guide to legal citation. However, it is important to use citations that will be understood by the audience for the legal research project.

{{dynamic list}}
Individuals from a variety of cultural or philosophical standpoints produced prolific Mormon-themed research, scholarship, or their popularization, in an era now past. Then, beginning in the decade of the 2000s, Mormon studies finally came into its own as an independent field of study when the sub-discipline became featured by then at a few academic institutions in the Western United States.

Some of the individuals with recognized expertise in the field are listed below. In consideration of space, members of Latter Day Saint movement denominations' overall leadership are not included (Dallin H. Oaks is listed for work he published prior his becoming a member of the LDS Church's Quorum of the Twelve).

'''''Mormon Stories Podcast''''' is a [[podcast]] principally hosted by [[John Dehlin]] featuring interviews with scholars and others especially on [[Mormonism|Mormon topics]]. The podcasts are noted for their often friendliness to [[LDS Church|Mormon]] [[Religious skepticism|skeptic]]s [[Mormon dissident|and dissident]]s.
==History==
In September 2005, after finding reasons to stay a member of the LDS Church, [[John Dehlin]] created the ''[http://mormonstories.org/ Mormon Stories]'' podcast as an open discussion of Mormon issues with the intention of giving listeners reasons to remain in the church.&lt;ref name=MS1&gt;{{cite web|author=Dehlin, John|title=Mormon Stories Podcast # 001: Bad Baptisms? My Mission Experience in Guatemala|work=Mormon Stories|date=September 4, 2005|url=http://mormonstories.org/?p=4|accessdate=2008-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through interviews, Mormon Stories focused on varying Mormon experiences and perspectives, including [[Anti-Mormonism|antagonistic]], [[Mormon apologetics|apologetic]], intellectual, [[Homosexuality and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|gay]], [[Black people and the Latter Day Saint movement|black]], [[Mormon fundamentalism|fundamentalist]], [[Women and Mormonism|feminist]], and [[Criticism of the Latter Day Saint movement|dissenting]].  Several notable Mormon figures were guests on ''Mormon Stories'', including [[Gregory Prince]], [[Todd Compton]], [[Grant H. Palmer]], [[Darius Gray]], [[Margaret Blair Young]], [[Richard Bushman]], and [[Paul Toscano|Margaret and Paul Toscano]].  To date, listenership at times exceeds 25,000 downloads per episode.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Mormon Stories has been featured in many venues, including being broadcast on [[KVNU]] in [[Logan, Utah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Grover, Tom|title=John Dehlin, Mormon Stories featured in today’s Herald Journal|date=January 3, 2008|publisher=KVNU’s For The People|url=http://kvnuforthepeople.com/?p=1258|accessdate=2008-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In June 2007 John Dehlin was quoted for stories by ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[Good Morning America]]'', discussing [[Mitt Romney]] and Mormonism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Church and State: Mormonism and Romney | date=June 19, 2007 | work=[[Good Morning America]] | publisher=[[ABC News]] | format=video | url=http://abcnews.go.com/Video/playerIndex?id=3293104 | accessdate=2008-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Goodstein, Laurie | title=Romney’s Run Has Mormons Wary of Scrutiny | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=June 11, 2007 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/11/us/politics/11mormons.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=1 | accessdate=2008-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At times personally conflicted about continuing ''Mormon Stories'', Dehlin stopped and restarted the project a few times.&lt;ref name=WhatIsWas&gt;{{cite AV media | title=What is/was Mormon Stories? | work=Mormon Stories Podcast | date=April 14, 2009 | archivedate= | archiveurl=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Some Bonus Material, and a Break | date=December 25, 2007 | work=Mormon Stories | url=http://mormonstories.org/?p=383 | accessdate=2010-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In January 2010 Dehlin resumed the blog and podcast, focusing on faith crises, mental illnesses, and notable guests,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Mormon Stories 2010 — A New Direction | work=Mormon Stories Podcast | date=January 15, 2010 | url=http://mormonstories.org/?p=716 | accessdate=2010-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; beginning with interviews of [[Joanna Brooks]] and [[John C. Hamer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Mormon Stories # 112 &amp; 113: Joanna Brooks Parts 1 and 2 | work=Mormon Stories Podcast | date=January 20, 2010 | url=http://mormonstories.org/?p=738 | accessdate=2010-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Mormon Stories # 116: John Hamer Pt. 1 — The LDS Succession Crisis of 1844 and the Beginnings of the RLDS Church | work=Mormon Stories Podcast | date=January 24, 2010 | url=http://mormonstories.org/?p=792 | accessdate=2010-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among numerous other regular hosts who have joined Dehlin in conducting interviews for the podcast were Dan Wotherspoon, former editor of ''[[Sunstone (magazine)|Sunstone]]'' magazine, and Natasha Helfer Parker, a licensed clinical marriage and family therapist.

{{As of|2015}}, Dehlin said Stories episodes had "tens of thousands" of listeners and that the webcast's "goal has always been to alleviate suffering. It’s an act of love."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher = [[BuzzFeed]] News|url = https://www.buzzfeed.com/jimdalrympleii/prominent-mormon-blogger-facing-excommunication-for-apostasy#.jyOR60gLp|title = Prominent Mormon Blogger Facing Excommunication For "Apostasy": John Dehlin founded the Mormon Stories podcast and has commented extensively on topics such as LGBT issues and gender within the religion.

==Criticism==
In 2013, a critical review of ''Mormon Stories'' by Gregory L. Smith was published in ''[[Interpreter: A Journal of Mormon Scripture]]''. In the review, Smith alleges that "Dehlin is frequently uninformed of the often controversial material he discusses with interviewees, and that he promotes views hostile to the foundational beliefs of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints".&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Smoot, [http://thestudentreview.org/controversial-paper-critiquing-popular-mormon-podcast-published/ "Controversial Paper Critiquing Popular Mormon Podcast Published"], ''Student Review'', February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=glsmith7 |url=http://seesangelsinthearchitecture.wordpress.com/2013/03/12/rollo-review-introduction/ |title=Rollo review – Introduction &amp;#124; Angels in the Architecture |publisher=Seesangelsinthearchitecture.wordpress.com |date=2013-03-12 |accessdate=2013-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pending publication of the piece catalyzed within the [[Mormon studies]] community a discussion (referred to by some as the ''Dehlin affair'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mormoninterpreter.com/tag/dehlin/ |title=Dehlin &amp;#124; Interpreter |publisher=Mormoninterpreter.com |date=2013-02-23 |accessdate=2013-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hamblin |first=William |url=http://mormonscriptureexplorations.org/2013/02/25/it-is-not-personal/ |title=It is not personal |publisher=Mormon Scripture Explorations |date=2013-02-25 |accessdate=2013-09-06 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022203902/http://mormonscriptureexplorations.org/2013/02/25/it-is-not-personal/ |archivedate=2013-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mormondialogue.org/topic/60186-the-dehlin-affair%E2%80%93the-current-uncivil-war/ |title=The Dehlin Affair–The Current Uncivil War - General Discussions - Mormon Dialogue &amp; Discussion Board |publisher=Mormondialogue.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; about the roles of apologetic and non-faith-based scholarship, respectively, within the academic study of Mormonism by Mormons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=B Hodges |url=http://www.maxwellinstituteblog.org/a-mormon-studies-blogliography/ |title=A Mormon Studies Blogliography |publisher=Maxwell Institute Blog |date=2013-08-16 |accessdate=2013-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://johnadamscenter.com/2012/06/did-john-dehlin-bring-down-the-mormon-studies-review-hint-the-answer-has-two-letters/ |title=Did John Dehlin Bring Down the Mormon Studies Review: (Hint: the answer has two letters…) |publisher=John Adams Center |date=2012-06-23 |accessdate=2013-09-05 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723065141/http://johnadamscenter.com/2012/06/did-john-dehlin-bring-down-the-mormon-studies-review-hint-the-answer-has-two-letters/ |archivedate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thestudentreview.org/controversy-over-dismissal-of-byu-professor/ |title=Controversy over dismissal of BYU professor from Mormon Studies |publisher=Student Review |date= |accessdate=2013-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''North Sea Germanic''', also known as '''Ingvaeonic''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɪ|ŋ|v|iː|ˈ|ɒ|n|ɪ|k}}, is a postulated grouping of the northern [[West Germanic languages]], consisting of [[Old Frisian]], [[Old English language|Old English]] and [[Old Saxon]] and their descendants.

Ingvaeonic is named after the [[Ingaevones]], a West Germanic cultural group or proto-tribe along the [[North Sea]] coast, mentioned by both [[Tacitus]] and [[Pliny the Elder]] (the latter mentioning that tribes in the group included the [[Cimbri]], the [[Teutoni]], and the [[Chauci]]). It is not thought of as a monolithic [[proto-language]] but rather as a group of closely related dialects that underwent several [[Areal change|areal changes]] in relative unison.

The grouping was first proposed in ''Nordgermanen und Alemannen'' (1942) by German linguist and philologist [[Friedrich Maurer (linguist)|Friedrich Maurer]] as an alternative to the strict [[Parse tree|tree diagrams]] that had become popular following the work of 19th-century linguist [[August Schleicher]] and assumed the existence of a special [[Anglo-Frisian languages|Anglo-Frisian]] group. The other groupings are [[Low Franconian languages|Istvaeonic]], from the [[Istvaeones]], including [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Afrikaans]] and related languages; and [[High German languages|Irminonic]], from the [[Irminones]], including the [[High German languages]].

==Characteristics==
Linguistic evidence for Ingvaeonic are common innovations observed in Old Frisian, Old English and Old Saxon such as the following:

*The so-called [[Ingvaeonic nasal spirant law]]: converted ''*munþ'' "mouth" into ''*mūþ'' (compare [[Old English]] ''mūþ'').
*The loss of Germanic third-person ''*s-'' [[reflexive pronoun]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Germanic Languages | first = Wayne | last = Harbert | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-0-521-80825-5 | page = 179 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The loss of [[grammatical person|person]] distinctions in [[plural]] forms of [[verb]]s, reducing three forms into one form ending in ''-þ''&lt;ref&gt;Harbert (2006), pp. 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The development of [[Germanic weak verb#Class III Verbs|Class III weak verbs]] into a relic class consisting of four verbs (''*sagjan'' "to say", ''*hugjan'' "to think", ''*habjan'' "to have", ''*libjan'' "to live")
*The split of the Class II weak verb ending &lt;span style="white-space:nowrap"&gt;''*-ō-''&lt;/span&gt; into &lt;span style="white-space:nowrap"&gt;''*-ō-/-ōja-''&lt;/span&gt;
*Development of a plural ending '''*-ōs''' in a-stem nouns 
*Possibly, the [[monophthongisation]] of ''*ai'' to ''ē/ā'', and ''*au'' to ''ō/ā'' (but that may represent independent changes in Old Saxon and [[Anglo-Frisian]])

Several, but not all, of the characteristics are also found in Dutch. It did not generally undergo the nasal spirant law (except for a few words), it kept the three plural endings distinct and it did not have the ''-s'' plural. However, it underwent near-full monophthongisation (some instances of &lt;span style="white-space:nowrap"&gt;''-ei-''&lt;/span&gt; persisted), lost the reflexive pronoun (even if it later regained it by borrowing) and had the same four relic verbs in weak class 3.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4280">An '''organic law''' is a [[law]], or system of laws, that form the foundation of a [[government]], [[corporation]] or any other organization's body of rules. A [[constitution]] is a particular form of organic law for a sovereign state.
==By country==
===France===
Under the current [[Constitution of France]], organic laws are a short, fixed list of statutes (in 2005, there were about 30 of them), whose existence is provisioned by the text of the Constitution itself. According to the framing of the French Constitution (especially its [[Constitution of France#Impact with respect to personal freedoms|preambles]]), they are of constitutional scope and have constitutional force and so overrule ordinary statutes. They are enacted by the [[Parliament of France]] in the same way except that the [[Constitutional Council of France]] must be consulted before any organic law is enacted.

Organic laws allow flexibility if needed. An important category is the legislative process for enacting the budgets of the [[Cabinet of France#Budget|French state]] and French [[social security]]. Other organic laws give the practical procedures for various [[election]]s. They reduce the need for amendments to the constitution.

===Spain===
{{Main|Organic Law (Spain)}}
Under the current [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Spanish Constitution of 1978|Constitution of 1978]], an Organic Law has an intermediate status between that of an ordinary law and of the constitution itself. It must be passed by an absolute majority of the [[Congress of Deputies (Spain)|Congress of Deputies]]. The Spanish Constitution specifies that some areas of law must be regulated by this procedure, such as the laws developing fundamental rights and freedoms recognized in the first section of Chapter Two of Title I of the Constitution, as well as the laws that approve the [[Statute of Autonomy|Statutes of Autonomy]] of the [[autonomous communities of Spain]], among others. Prior to the 1978 constitution, the concept did not exist in Spain, but it is inspired by the similar concept in the 1958 French Constitution.

===United States===
{{see also|Organic act}}

The organic laws of the United States of America can be found in Volume One of the United States Code which contains the general and permanent laws of the United States. [[U.S. Code]] (2007)&lt;ref&gt;[http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/organiclaws.txt 2007 U.S. Code] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205190815/http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/organiclaws.txt |date=2010-12-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; defines the organic laws of the United States of America to include the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776]], the [[Articles of Confederation|Articles of Confederation of November 15, 1777]], the [[Northwest Ordinance|Northwest Ordinance of July 13, 1787]], and the [[US Constitution|Constitution of September 17, 1787]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=L-Y4AAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=titlepage#PPR23,M1 U.S. Code]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/organiclaws.txt 2007 Publication of the U.S. Code including the organic laws] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205190815/http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/organiclaws.txt |date=2010-12-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8282">A '''parliamentary leader''' is a political title or a descriptive term used in various countries to the person leading a [[caucus]] (or [[parliamentary group]]) in a legislative body, whether it be a national or sub-national legislature. A [[party leader]] may be the same person as the parliamentary leader, or the roles may be separated.

==Terminology==
In many countries, the position of [[party leader|leader of a political party]] (that is, the organisational leader) and leader of a parliamentary group are separate positions, and while they are often held by the same person,&lt;ref name="Pilet–Cross"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pilet|first1=Jean-Benoit|last2=Cross|first2=William|title=The Selection of Political Party Leaders in Contemporary Parliamentary Democracies: A Comparative Study|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317929451|page=190|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=_2mvBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA190|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; this is not always or automatically the case. If the party leader is a member of the government, holds a different political office outside the parliamentary body in question, or no political office at all, the position of parliamentary leader is frequently held by a different person.&lt;ref name="Heidar"/&gt;

In English, the leader may be referred to as a "parliamentary chairman", "group leader"&lt;ref name="europarl"&gt;{{cite web|title=Profile of the leaders of Parliament's political groups|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+IM-PRESS+20090710FCS58034+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN|publisher=European Parliament|accessdate=17 August 2017|language=en|date=17 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; or simply "parliamentary leader", among other names.

==Examples==
{{expand section|date=August 2017}}
===Canada===
{{See also|Interim leader (Canada)}}
A parliamentary leader is chosen in [[politics of Canada|Canadian politics]] to lead their [[caucus]] in a legislative body, whether it be the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]] or a provincial legislature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jeffrey|first1=Brooke|title=Divided Loyalties: The Liberal Party of Canada, 1984-2008|date=2010|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=9780802038487|page=604|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BGdYR_ZTyRAC&amp;pg=PA604|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; They serve as interim legislative leaders, when a party leader either has no seat in the legislative body, during a transition period preceding, or following a leadership contest.

===European Parliament===
Each of the seven [[political groups of the European Parliament]] has its own group leader. The groups within the European Parliament are often very broad, so the position of the group leader is a unifying one—they may help to consolidate MEPs with similar outlooks ahead of important votes.&lt;ref name="europarl"/&gt; The groups are organisationally separate from a [[European political party]], and multiple parties often ally as a single group, thus the distinction between a party and a parliamentary leader is usually strict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Political groups in the European Parliament. Parties in EU.|url=http://www.itsyourparliament.eu/groups/|website=www.itsyourparliament.eu|accessdate=17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
In German politics, leaders of the major parties have often been heads of government of the various states rather than members of the national parliament.&lt;ref name="Heidar"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heidar|first1=Knut|last2=Koole|first2=Ruud|title=Parliamentary Party Groups in European Democracies: Political Parties Behind Closed Doors|date=2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134594764|page=33–34|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rgGDAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA33|accessdate=17 August 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, the position of parliamentary leader in the [[Bundestag|federal parliament]] (Germany also has 16 state parliaments) is often occupied by a different person. The parliamentary leader has the supreme responsibility for coordinating the work of the MPs representing his or her party. Even when the party leader is a member of the national parliament, the parliamentary leader can be a different person. For instance,
[[Friedrich Merz]] was parliamentary leader while [[Angela Merkel]] was party leader for some years while the [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]] was in opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Geis|first1=Matthias|last2=Hildebrandt|first2=Tina|title=Angela Merkel: Not Our Ms. Merkel|url=http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2015-09/angela-merkel-refugees-politics-germany-cdu/komplettansicht|work=[[Die Zeit]]|date=26 September 2015|accessdate=17 August 2017|language=de-DE}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the party leader is the [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] or a member of the government, another person always is the parliamentary leader.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

===United Kingdom===
In [[politics of the United Kingdom|British politics]], the leader of a party is typically the same person as the parliamentary leader. The leader may not fully control the party bureaucracy.&lt;ref name="Leach–Coxall–Robins"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leach|first1=Robert|last2=Coxall|first2=Bill|last3=Robins|first3=Lynton|title=British Politics|date=2011|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=9780230344228|page=102|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=l6McBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA102|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The leader may be chosen by [[Member of Parliament|MPs]] from among their number, or elected by the wider party membership at a [[party conference]], but once elected must retain the support of the parliamentary party.&lt;ref name="Leach–Coxall–Robins"/&gt; Similarly, the position of [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]] may be given to the parliamentary leader (viz. party leader) of the largest political party in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|parliament]], with the expectation they will be able secure and retain the [[confidence and supply|confidence]] of a majority of MPs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Government and Opposition roles|url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/mps-and-lords/principal/government-opposition/|website=www.parliament.uk|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=17 August 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leyland|first1=Peter|title=The Constitution of the United Kingdom: A Contextual Analysis|date=2016|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=9781849469081|page=121|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=V-8cDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT121|accessdate=17 August 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some smaller parties have parliamentary leaders in the national parliament (in Westminster) who are separate from the party leaders—the party leader may hold office in a [[devolution in the United Kingdom|devolved]] (sub-national) parliament or assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Leonard|first1=Ian|title=Why does Nicola Sturgeon not have a seat in Westminster?|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/nicola-sturgeon-not-seat-westminster-5665836|accessdate=17 August 2017|work=Daily Mirror|date=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Williamson|first1=David|title=Liz Saville Roberts is Plaid Cymru's new Westminster leader|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/politics/liz-saville-roberts-plaid-cymrus-13186885|accessdate=17 August 2017|work=Wales Online|date=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia and New Zealand===
In [[Politics of Australia|Australian]] and [[New Zealand politics]], the party figure commonly described as "leader" is usually an MP responsible for managing the party's business within parliament. Party constitutions will typically distinguish between the parliamentary leader and the organisational leader (who typically is outside of parliament), with the latter often termed a "federal president" or "party president".&lt;ref name="Pilet–Cross"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Labour Party Constitution and Rules|url=https://www.elections.org.nz/sites/default/files/Labour_Party_Rules_1.pdf|website=www.elections.org.nz|publisher=New Zealand Labour Party|accessdate=17 August 2017|date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two roles are organisationally distinct even if close cooperation is expected.&lt;ref name="Pilet–Cross"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12022">The '''phenomenology of religion''' concerns the [[Experience|experiential]] aspect of [[religion]], describing religious phenomena in terms consistent with the orientation of worshippers. It views religion as made up of different components, and studies these components across religious traditions in order to gain some understanding of them.

== Chantepie de la Saussaye ==
The first explicit use of the phrase "phenomenology of religion" occurs in the ''Lehrbuch der Religionsgeschichte'' (Handbook of the History of Religions), written by Pierre Daniël Chantepie de la Saussaye in 1887, wherein he articulates the task of the science of religion and gives an "Outline of the phenomenology of religion".&lt;ref&gt;Van der Leeuw 1963: 694; cf. James: 42-45)&lt;/ref&gt; Employing the terminology of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], Chantepie divides his science of religion into two areas of investigation, essence and manifestations, which are approached through investigations in philosophy and history, respectively.  However, Chantepie’s phenomenology "belongs neither to the history nor the philosophy of religion as Hegel envisioned them".&lt;ref&gt;45&lt;/ref&gt; For Chantepie, it is the task of phenomenology to prepare historical data for philosophical analysis through "a collection, a grouping, an arrangement, and a classifying of the principal groups of religious conceptions".&lt;ref&gt;43&lt;/ref&gt; This sense of phenomenology as a grouping of manifestations is similar to the conception of phenomenology articulated by Robison and the British; however, insofar as Chantepie conceives of phenomenology as a preparation for the philosophical elucidation of essences, his phenomenology is not completely opposed to that of Hegel.

== Kristensen ==
Chantepie’s ''Lehrbuch'' was highly influential, and many researchers began similar efforts after its publication and its subsequent translation into English and French.&lt;ref&gt;141&lt;/ref&gt; One such researcher was [[William Brede Kristensen]].  In 1901, Kristensen was appointed the first professorship relating to the phenomenology of religion at the University of Leiden.&lt;ref&gt;[[ibid]]&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the material from Kristensen’s lectures on the phenomenology of religion was edited posthumously, and the English translation was published in 1960 as ''The Meaning of Religion''.&lt;ref&gt;Kristensen: xiii&lt;/ref&gt; James notes that Kristensen’s phenomenology "adopts many of the features of Chantepie’s grouping of religious phenomena," and penetrates further into the intricacies of Chantepie’s phenomenological approach.&lt;ref&gt;James: 141-43&lt;/ref&gt;
  
For Chantepie, phenomenology is affected by the philosophy and [[history of religion]], but for Kristensen, it is also the medium whereby the philosophy and history of religion interact with and affect one another.&lt;ref&gt;Kristensen: 9&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, Kristensen’s account of the relationship between historical manifestations and philosophy is more similar to that of Hegel than it is to Chantepie.  In defining the religious essence of which he explores historical manifestations, Kristensen appropriates [[Rudolf Otto]]’s conception of ''das Heilige'' ("the holy" or "the sacred").  Otto describes ''das Heilige'' with the expression ''mysterium tremendum et fascinans''—a numinous power revealed in a moment of "awe" that admits of both the horrible shuddering of "religious dread" (''tremendum'') and fascinating wonder (''fascinans'') with the overpowering majesty (''majestas'') of the ineffable, "wholly other" mystery (''mysterium'').&lt;ref&gt;Kristensen: 15-18; Otto: 5-32&lt;/ref&gt;

Like Chantepie, Kristensen argues that phenomenology seeks the “meaning” of religious phenomena.  Kristensen clarifies this supposition by defining the meaning that his phenomenology is seeking as “the meaning that the religious phenomena have for the believers themselves”.&lt;ref&gt;James: 144&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Kristensen argues that phenomenology is not complete in grouping or classifying the phenomena according to their meaning, but in the act of understanding.  “Phenomenology has as its objects to come as far as possible into contact with and to understand the extremely varied and divergent religious data”.&lt;ref&gt;Kristensen: 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Being a phenomenologist, Kristensen was less interested in philosophical presuppositions than in his concrete depth-research in the incidental religious phenomena. These subjects concerned mythological material (such as Creation, the Flood etc.) as well as human action (such as baptism, Olympic Games etc.), and objects of nature and handicrafts.
In all of this he only made use of the authentic sources: writings and images by the believers themselves. This procedure compelled him to reduce the field of his research - he had to profoundly master all relating languages and writings in order to be able to understand his sources in a way as they would have wanted to be understood themselves.
Consequently, he reduced his field of research to the phenomena in religions living around the origin of Christianity: during the millennia before and the centuries after Christ, in Iran (Avesta), Babylonia and Assyria, Israel, Egypt, Greece and Rome.
The required knowledge of speeches, also, is one of the causes that only few (Van der Leeuw, Bleeker) of his pupils did carry on in his line, although many scholars showed interests in the results of his research.
Apart from his synopsis ''The Meaning of Religion'', and a just simple ''Introduction in History of Religion'', his publications are mostly restricted to the results of his incidental partial researches, published in the shape of a Communication of the Royal Academy of the Netherlands.

== van der Leeuw ==
The phenomenological approach to religion developed in [[Gerardus van der Leeuw]]’s ''Phänomenologie der Religion'' (1933) follows Kristensen in many respects, while also appropriating the phenomenology of [[Martin Heidegger]] and the [[hermeneutics]] of [[Wilhelm Dilthey]].

For van der Leeuw, understanding is the subjective aspect of phenomena, which is inherently intertwined with the objectivity of that which is manifest.  Van der Leeuw articulates the relation of understanding to understood phenomena according to the schema outlined in Dilthey’s definition of the human sciences (''Geisteswissenschaften'') as sciences that are “based on the relations between experience, expression and understanding” (“''Verhältnis von Erlebnis, Ausdruck, und Verstehen''”).&lt;ref&gt;Van der Leeuw 1956: 776; 1963a: 676&lt;/ref&gt; Van der Leeuw correlates subjective experience, expression, and understanding with three objective levels of appearing—relative concealment (''Verborgenheit''), relative transparency (''Durchsichtigkeit''), and gradually becoming manifest or revealed (''Offenbarwerden''), wherein the understanding of what is becoming revealed is the primordial level of appearing from which the experienced concealment and expressed transparency of appearing are derived.&lt;ref&gt;1956: 769; 1963a: 671&lt;/ref&gt;

Because van der Leeuw, like Kristensen, appropriates Otto’s concept of ''das Heilige'' in defining the essential category of religion, the transcendence becoming revealed in all human understanding can be further described as sacred — an overpowering “wholly other,” which becomes revealed in astonishing moments of dreadful [[awe]] (''Scheu'') and wonderful fascination.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Leeuw 1963: 23, 681; Otto: 14-32&lt;/ref&gt; Van der Leeuw argues that this concept of religious dread is also present in Kierkegaard’s work on ''[[Angst]]'' and in Heidegger’s statement that “what arouses dread is ‘being in the world’ itself”.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Leeuw 1963: 463; cf. Kierkegaard; Heidegger 1962; 230&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, van der Leeuw recognizes that, although dreadful, Being-in-the-world is fundamentally characterized as [[wikt:cura|care]] (''Sorge''), the existential structure whereby ''[[Dasein]]'' is concerned with meaningful relationships in the world alongside other beings.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Leeuw 1963: 339, 543; cf. Heidegger 1962: 364-70&lt;/ref&gt;

Because all experiences disclose concealed (wholly other) transcendence to the understanding, all experiences of Being-in-the-world are ultimately religious experiences of the sacred, whether explicitly recognized as such or not.  Human being as such is ''[[homo religiosus]]'', the opposite of ''homo negligens''.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Leeuw 1963: 50, 680&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the task of the phenomenology of religion to interpret the various ways in which the sacred appears to human beings in the world, the ways in which humans understand and care for that which is revealed to them, for that which is ultimately wholly other mystery.
Among other great phenomenologists who worked and influenced phenomenology of religion are [[Henry Corbin]],  [[Ninian Smart]], [[Mircea Eliade]].

'''Qashani''' or '''Kashani''' is a [[Persian Empire|Persian]] decorative arts which had been popular in [[Iran]] in the 16th to 18th century, and then moved to [[Turkey]] in the time of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] with the transfer of many Persians artists to Turkey, becoming the basis for decorating the walls of [[mosque]]s, palaces, shrines and tombs. It is a square-shaped ceramic tile which uses Persian-like floral-depicting 4- or 6-sided glazed tiles, decorated with blue, cyan, green and sometimes red colors. The decoration is surrounded by fine black lines that make it stand out on its white floor. The tile work had often been decorated by the inscription, floral and [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometrical pattern]]s. The inscription often provides [[Qur'an]]ic verses or sentences related to historical events written in Persian script. The plant often consists of natural flowers such as lily, cloves, roses and cypress trees. Geometrical patterns consists of different geometrical shapes and polygons. In [[Morocco]], similar artistic technique is known as [[zellige|''zillij'']]. Its use has been widespread in the decoration of the walls of the buildings in the Ottoman era, and this mosaical feature can also be seen in the [[Dome of the Rock]] in [[Jerusalem]]. Kashi, the abbreviated form of Qashani, was also introduced to [[Sindh]], [[Kutch]], and [[Multan]] where numerous examples of shrines and mosques embellished with blue, white and green tile work exist.&lt;ref&gt; Leadless Decorative Tiles, Faience, and Mosaic: 
William James Furnival - 1904 - This style of decoration is called Kashani, after Kashan in Persia, one of the chief seats of earthenware manufacture .&lt;/ref&gt;

Her focus was on [[medieval Welsh literature]], and she was Emeritus Reader in Celtic Languages and Literature at the [[University of Cambridge|Department of Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic at Cambridge]] until her death.&lt;ref&gt;A Scholar of Early Britain: Rachel Bromwich&lt;/ref&gt; Among her most important contributions to the study of Welsh literature is ''Trioedd Ynys Prydein'', her edition of the [[Welsh Triads]].

==Life==
Bromwich was born '''Rachel Amos''' in [[Hove]], [[England]], in 1915. Her father, [[Maurice Amos]], was an English legal expert who served as international law adviser to the [[Egypt]]ian government; her mother was [[Scotland|Scottish]] and strongly associated with the [[Quakers]]. The family moved frequently before settling in [[Cumbria]] in 1925. In 1934 Rachel Amos attended [[Newnham College, Cambridge]], where she studied the [[Anglo-Saxon language]] before shifting departments to focus on [[Middle Welsh]]. In 1938 she moved to the [[University College of Wales, Bangor]] and studied under [[Ifor Williams]]. Amos took a great interest in Medieval Welsh literature, and particularly the [[Arthurian legend]]; it was Williams' suggestion that she edit the Welsh Triads. As a university teacher, she combined rigorous scholarship with great personal kindness, always ready to help and share knowledge with her students, taking a close interest in their careers. She was awarded the degree of D.Litt. by the [[University of Wales]] for her services to Welsh scholarship. In 1939 she married John Bromwich; they had one son, Brian.

She became interested in medieval literature and the Welsh language in college. In 1961 she published ''Trioedd Ynys Prydein'', her influential edition of the [[Welsh Triads]]. A third, thoroughly revised edition was published in 2006. 
It is much more widely consulted by scholars than might be supposed from the specialised nature of the text, thanks to her extensive notes on the names of a wide range of characters in Welsh myth and legend. Her other major contribution to Welsh scholarship was her series of books and articles on [[Dafydd ap Gwilym]], the outstanding Welsh poet of the period, mostly summarised in ''Aspects of the Poetry of Dafydd ap Gwilym'' (Cardiff, 1985). With D. Simon Evans she produced editions of the major medieval Welsh tale ''Culhwch and Olwen'' in both Welsh (1988) and English (1992).

The study of '''religion and ritual of the Cucuteni-Trypillia culture''' has provided important insights into the early [[history of Europe]]. The [[Cucuteni-Trypillian culture|Cucuteni-Trypillia culture]], which existed in the present-day [[Southeast Europe|southeastern European]] nations of [[Moldova]], [[Romania]], and [[Ukraine]] during the [[Neolithic|Neolithic Age]] and [[Copper Age]], from approximately 5500 BC to 2750 BC, left behind thousands of [[Human settlement|settlement]] ruins containing a wealth of [[Archaeology|archaeological]] [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] attesting to their [[Archaeological culture|cultural]] and [[Assemblage (archaeology)|technological]] characteristics.&lt;ref name="Mallory"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Mallory|first1= James P|title= In search of the Indo-Europeans: language, archaeology and myth|year= 1989|publisher= Thames and Hudson|location= London|isbn= 0-500-05052-X|oclc= 246601873}}&lt;/ref&gt; Refer to the [[Cucuteni-Trypillian culture|main article]] for a general description of this culture; this article deals with its [[Religion|religious]] and [[ritual]]istic aspects.

Some Cucuteni-Trypillia communities have been found that contain a special building located in the center of the settlement, which archaeologists have identified as sacred sanctuaries. Artifacts have been found inside these sanctuaries, some of them having been intentionally buried in the ground within the structure, that are clearly of a religious nature, and have provided insights into some of the beliefs, and perhaps some of the rituals and structure, of the members of this society. Additionally, artifacts of an apparent religious nature have also been found within many domestic Cucuteni-Trypillia homes.

Many of these artifacts are clay figurines or statues. Archaeologists have identified many of these as [[Fetishism|fetishes]] or [[totem]]s, which are believed to be imbued with powers that can help and protect the people who look after them. These Cucuteni-Trypillia figurines have become known popularly as Goddesses, however, this is actually a misnomer from a scientific point of view. There have been so many of these so-called clay Goddesses discovered in Cucuteni-Trypillia sites that many museums in eastern Europe have a sizeable collection of them, and as a result, they have come to represent one of the more readily-identifiable visual markers of this culture to many people.

==Archaeological artifacts==
As mentioned above, beginning in the Precucuteni III period (circa 4800-4600 BC), special communal sanctuary buildings began to appear in Cucuteni-Trypillia settlements. They continued to exist during the Cucuteni A and Cucuteni A/B (corresponding to Trypillia B) periods (circa 4600-3800 BC), but then for some reason these sanctuaries began to disappear, until in the Cucuteni B (Trypillia C) period (circa 3800-3500 BC) only a few examples have been discovered from archaeological exploration. These sanctuaries were constructed in a monumental style architecture, and included [[Stele|stelae]], statues, [[shrine]]s, and numerous other ceremonial and religious artifacts, sometimes packed in straw inside pottery.&lt;ref name="Lazarovici"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Lazarovici | first = Cornelia-Magda | title = Anthropomorphic statuettes from Cucuteni-Trypillian site: some signs and symbols | journal = Documenta Praehistorica | volume = 32 | series = Neolitske študije | pages = 145–154 | publisher = Univerza v Ljubljani, Filozofska fakulteta, Oddelek za arheologijo | location = Ljubljana | year = 2005 | url = http://arheologija.ff.uni-lj.si/documenta/pdf32/32lazarovici.pdf | issn = 1408-967X | language = English, Slovenian | oclc = 41553667 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111002225237/http://arheologija.ff.uni-lj.si/documenta/pdf32/32lazarovici.pdf | archivedate = 2 October 2011 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of these artifacts originally seemed to represent themes that are [[Chthonic]] (of the [[Underworld]]), and [[Heaven|Celestial/Heavenly]], or of the [[Celestial sphere|sky]]. During an excavation in 1973 at the Cucuteni-Trypillia site at Ghelăiești, near the city of Neamț, Romania, archaeologist Ștefan Cucoș discovered a house in the center of the settlement that was the community sanctuary. The following account written by Croatian archeologist Marina Hoti describes the findings within this sanctuary:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In the southeast corner of the house a vase surrounded by six vases was found under the floor. The central vase was turned upside down, covering another vessel with a lid, in which four anthropomorphic figurines were found, arranged in a cross and looking to the four sides of the world. Two figurines were decorated with lines and had completely black heads and legs; the other two were not coloured, but they had traces of ocher red.&lt;ref name="Hoti"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Hoti | first = Marina  | title = Vučedol-Streimov vinograd: magijski ritual i dvojni grob vučedolske kulture |trans-title=Vučedol-Streim vineyard: the magical ritual and the twin grave of the Vučedol-Culture | journal =  | volume = 17 | issue =  | pages = 183 to 205 | series = ''Opvscvla Archaeologica Radovi Arheološkog zavoda'' (Opvscvla Archaeologica Papers of the Department of Archaeology) | publisher = Arheoloski institut Sveucilista | location = Zagreb | date = December 1993 | url = http://hrcak.srce.hr/file/8512 | language = Croatian, English | issn = 0473-0992 | oclc = 166882629 | accessdate = 5 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Refer to the two accompanying images for a visual depiction of the four figurines within the upturned pot buried in the sanctuary at the Ghelăiești site. Subsequent analysis of this discovery has led to a number of interpretations by various scholars over the years. Ștefan Cucoș, who discovered the artifact, included other symbols discovered at Ghelăiești, including snake-like depictions, the cross-shape of altars, and [[swastika]] designs, concluded that it was associated with a ritual of fertility dedicated to the Goddess, associating the black-painted figurines with chthonic themes, and the red ocher-painted figurines with celestial or heavenly themes.&lt;ref name="Cucoș2"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Cucoș | first = Ștefan | title = ''Un complexe ritual cucutenien découvert a Ghelăiești, dép.

[[Marija Gimbutas]], Lithuanian archaeologist and author of "The Civilization of the Goddess", interpreted this discovery as a dualistic interpretation of summer and winter, representing the cycle of life and death in nature.

However, later analysis of this discovery incorporated the entire setting in which these painted figurines were found: specifically, that they were buried under an upturned ceramic vessel. Comparing this find with other similar discoveries from contemporary cultures  in Isaiia and Poduri,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Marinescu-Bîlcu | first = Silvia | title = ''"Dansul ritual" în reprezentările plastice neo eneolitice din Moldova'' |trans-title=Neo-plastic representations of Neolithic "Dance ritual" of Moldova | journal = Studii și cercetări de istorie veche și arheologie (SCIVA) | volume = 25 | issue = 2 | pages = 167 | publisher = Academia Română, Institutul de Arheologie Vasile Pârvan | location = Bucharest | year = 1974 | url = http://www.cimec.ro/Arheologie/SCIVA/sciva.htm | issn = 0039-4009 | oclc = 183328819 | language = Romanian}}&lt;/ref&gt; scholars developed a theory that the tableau taken in its setting, being buried beneath the floor of the sanctuary, and with the four figurines facing outward to the four cardinal directions, represented a means to protect the sanctuary and settlement from evil. The black heads of the figurines were associated with death, and the red ocher was painted on the figurines on the precise body parts that the Cucuteni-Trypillia culture painted on the body parts of their dead before burial. These figurines, therefore, most likely represented departed souls, or beings from the underworld (land of the dead). By enclosing them in an overturned vessel, and burying this entire arrangement under the floor of the sanctuary, they were protecting the settlement from the evil influences these figurines represented by creating a magical [[Sigil (magic)|sigil]] of protection.&lt;ref name="Hoti" /&gt;

==Mother Goddess figurines==
{{See also|Mother Goddess}}
As evidence from archaeology, thousands of artifacts from Neolithic Europe have been discovered, mostly in the form of female figurines. As a result a goddess theory has occurred. The leading historian was [[Marija Gimbutas]], still this interpretation is a subject of great controversy in archaeology due to her many inferences about the symbols on artifacts.&lt;ref name="Collins"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://uts.cc.utexas.edu/~gloria/Goddess.html | title = Will the "Great Goddess" resurface?: Reflections in Neolithic Europe | first = Gloria | last = Collins | publisher = University of Texas at Austin | location = Austin, Texas | accessdate = 1 December 2009 | postscript = This site was a student brief done for a class assignment. | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/19991012001508/http://uts.cc.utexas.edu/~gloria/Goddess.html | archivedate = 12 October 1999 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers consider that the symbols used for representing the feminity are the [[rhombus]] for [[fertility]] and the [[triangle]] as a symbol for [[fecundity]].&lt;ref name="Chirica"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Chirica | first = Vasile  | title = Teme ale reprezentării "Marii Zeițe" în arta paleolitică și neolitică |trans-title=The "Marii Zeițe" theme represented in paleolithic and neolithic art | journal = Memoria antiquitatis | volume = 23 | pages = 103–127 | publisher = Muzeului de Istorie Piatra Neamț | location = Piatra Neamț | year = 2004 | url = http://www.neamt.ro/cmj/istorie/piatra-neamt/Memoria_Antiquitatis.html | language  = Romanian | issn = 1222-7528 | oclc = 183318963}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cross, symbolizing nature's power of fertility and renewal, was sometimes used to represent masculinity, as well as the phases of the moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Gimbutas | first = Marija Alseikaitė | author-link = Marija Gimbutas | title = The gods and goddesses of old Europe, 7000 to 3500 BC: myths, legends and cult images |  place = London | publisher = Thames &amp; Hudson | year = 1974 | url = http://openlibrary.org/b/OL5097525M/gods_and_goddesses_of_old_Europe_7000_to_3500_BC | pages = 303 | isbn = 0-500-05014-7 | oclc = 979750}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This ritual assemblies lay in a vase that had a very anomalous shape to the Precucuteni style and were full of soil and straw. The cultic objects were put on display and worshiped during magic-religious ceremonies. The repeated use of them is proven by the presence of some chipping from wear. When not in motion, they were probably stored in this special container. The presence of soil under some statuettes kept in the vase, and the evidence of cariossids on the surface of two figurines and four stools, led some researchers to hypothesize that the pieces had been deposited in soil and straw for magical purposes: they had been left to bud.
all the statues were distinct. Some of them bear geometrical decorations. There were observed mature statuettes (that have already given birth), young statuettes (that have not yet given birth), and a babies . Only the mature figurines may sit by right on clay stools.

==Bird goddess figurines==
[[File:CucutenibirdGoddess.JPG|thumb|Bird Goddesses]]
According to some researchers as Gimbutas, Lazarocici, for the Precucuteni communities, mythic birds possibly embodied a solar principle and the revival of the life, serving as a symbol of prosperity and protection.

==Funerary rites==
One of the unanswered questions regarding the Cucuteni-Trypillia culture is the small number of artifacts associated with funerary rites. Although very large settlements have been explored by archaeologists, the evidence for mortuary activity is almost invisible. Making a distinction between the eastern Tripolye and the western Cucuteni regions of the Cucuteni-Trypillia geographical area, American archaeologist Douglass W. Bailey writes: &lt;blockquote&gt;There are no Cucuteni cemeteries and the Tripolye ones that have been discovered are very late.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ref name="Bailey"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Bailey | first = Douglass W. | title = Prehistoric figurines: representation and corporeality in the Neolithic | publisher =  Routledge | year = 2005 | location = London; New York | url = http://www.routledge.com/9780415331517 | oclc = 56686499}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=115}} The discovery of skulls is more frequent than other parts of the body, however because there has not yet been a comprehensive statistical survey done of all of the skeletal remains discovered at Cucuteni-Trypillia sites, precise [[post excavation]] analysis of these discoveries cannot be accurately determined at this time.

Some historians have contrasted the funerary practices of the Cucuteni-Trypillia culture with the neighboring [[Linear Pottery culture]], which existed from 5500-4500 BC in the region of present-day Hungary and extending westward into central Europe, making it coincide with the Precucuteni to Cucuteni A Phases. Archaeological evidence from the Linear Pottery sites have shown that they practiced [[cremation]], as well as [[inhumation]] (or burial). However, there appears to have been a distinction made in the Linear-Pottery culture on where the bodies were interred, based on gender and social dominance. Women and children were found to be buried beneath the floor of the house, while men were missing, indicating some other practice was associated with how they dealt with the dead bodies of males. One of the  conclusions drawn from this evidence was espoused by Marija Gimbutas, author of ''The Civilization of the Goddess: The world of Old Europe'', in which she theorizes that women and children were associated with hearth and home, and so they would be buried beneath it as an act of connecting their bodies to the home.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Gimbutas | first = Marija Alseikaitė | author-link = Marija Gimbutas | title = The civilization of the Goddess: the world of Old Europe | place = San Francisco | publisher = HarperSanFrancisco | year = 1991 | url = http://csp.org/chrestomathy/civilization_of.html | isbn = 0-06-250368-5 | oclc = 123210574}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Collectively taking these characteristics of the neighboring Linear Pottery culture into consideration, scholars have theorized that additional Cucuteni-Tryilian sites may be found, including locations that may be detached from the main settlements, where there may be evidence of the practice of cremation. Archaeologists have discussed broadening the search areas around known Cucuteni-Trypillia settlements to cover a much wider area, and to employ modern techniques to help try to find evidence of outlying sites where evidence of funerary activities could be found.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Boghian | first = Dumitru D. | title = Comunitățile cucuteniene din bazinul Bahluiului (rezumat) | trans-title = The Cucutenian communities in the bahlui Basin (summary) |language=Romanian, English, French |translator=Sergiu Ruptaș |translator2=Alexandru Dan Boghian |translator3=Otilia Ignătescu |url=http://eneoliticulestcarpatic.blogspot.com/2008/04/comunitile-cucuteniene-din-bazinul_07.html | place = Suceava, Romania | publisher = Editura Bucovina Istorică şi Editura Universităţii, Universitatea "Ştefan cel Mare" Suceava (Bukovina Publishing House and University Publishing House, The "Ştefan cel Mare" University of Suceava) | year = 2004 | laydate = 7 April 2008 | accessdate = 11 December 2009}} – This is a summary written by the author of a monograph with the same title, and posted to his online blog ''Eneoliticul est-carpatic'' (Eneolithic Eastern Carpathian)&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to cremation and burial, other possible methods of disposing of the bodies of the dead have been suggested. Romanian archaeologists Silvia Marinescu-Bîlcu and Alexandra Bolomey suggest a common practice of abandoning the body to the mercy of Mother Nature,&lt;ref name="Marinescu-Bîlcu"&gt;{{Citation | last = Marinescu-Bîlcu | first = Silvia | last2 = Bolomey | first2 = Alexandra | last3 = Cârciumaru | first3 = Marin | title = Drăgușeni: a Cucutenian community | series = Archaeologia Romanica | volume = 2 | place = Bucharest | publisher = Editura Enciclopedică | year = 2000 | pages = 198 | isbn = 973-45-0329-4 | oclc = 48400843 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=157}} a practice that may be somewhat similar to the [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] tradition of placing the bodies of the dead on top of a [[Tower of Silence]] (or Dakhma), which are then fed upon by [[Scavenger|carrion]] birds.

Russian archaeologist Tamara Grigorevna Movsha proposed a theory, in 1960, to explain the absence of some bones, as considered to have magical powers and were scattered on purpose across the settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Tamara Grigorevna | last = Movsha | year = 1960 | chapter = К вопросу о трипольских погребениях с обрядом трупоположения |trans-chapter=The issue of Trypillian funeral rite provisions for corpses | title = Материалы и исследования по археологии Юго-Запада СССР и Румынской Народной Республики |trans-title=Materials and research in archeology of the southwestern USSR and the Romanian People's Republic | pages = 59–76 | place = Chişinău | publisher = USSR Academy of Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have suggested the practices of [[cannibalism]] (known also as anthrophagy), or [[excarnation]], which is the practice of removing the flesh and organs of the dead, leaving only the bones. Romanian archaeologist Sergiu Haimovici writes about such a discovery:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''...Alexandra Bolomey...made a review&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Bolomey | first = Alexandra | title = Noi descoperiri de oase umane într-o așezare Cucuteniană |trans-title=New discovery of human bones in a Cucuteni site | journal = Cercetǎri arheologice | volume = 6 | pages = 159–173 | series = Colecția Istorie și civilizație (History and Civilization Collection) | publisher = Bucuresti Glasul Bucovinei | location = Bucharest | year = 1983 | language = Romanian | oclc = 224531079}}&lt;/ref&gt; of a series of...human remains, (and) found...at least partly, (that) they have a [[Human sacrifice|cultic]] character and maybe even...an [[Cannibalism|antropophagy]] {{sic}} of (a) cultic type.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Haimovici | first = Sergiu | title = The human bone with possible marks of human teeth found at Liveni site (Cucuteni culture) | journal = Studia Antiqua et Archaeologica | volume = 9 | pages = 97–100 | publisher = Iaşi University | location = Iaşi, Romania | year = 2003 | language = English | translator-first = Monica | translator-last = Popa | url = http://cisa.uaic.ro/saa/saa9/art.7.Haimovici%20.pdf | oclc = 224741260 | accessdate = 9 December 2009 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110813154117/http://cisa.uaic.ro/saa/saa9/art.7.Haimovici%20.pdf | archivedate = 13 August 2011 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; This would indicate that perhaps some ritualistic cannibalism was practiced among the Cucuteni-Trypillia tribes.

The only conclusion which can be drawn from archeological evidence is that in the Cucuteni-Trypillia culture, in the vast majority of cases, the bodies were not formally deposited within the settlement area.&lt;ref name="Bailey" /&gt;{{rp|page=116}}

Still in one of few sites, where researchers have found a significant number of human remains (Poduri Dealul Ghindaru in Romania), it seems possible in analyzing the findings, that in the early Cucuteni Culture, the children and infants were inhumed near the houses or even under the house floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bio.uaic.ro/publicatii/anale_zoologie/issue/2010/21-2010.pdf|format=PDF|title=ANATOMICAL DESCRIPTION OF HUMAN REMAINS DISCOVERED IN THE PREHISTORICAL SITE OF CUCUTENI CULTURE AT PODURI-DEALUL GHINDARU (BACĂU COUNTY, ROMANIA)|publisher=Bio.uaic.ro|accessdate=20 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cremation==

Various researchers have some hypotheses about Cucuteni rituals:
# Incineration Ritual of Cucuteni-Trypillya  houses, most probable associated with interment and immolation.
# a ritual, who consider sacrifice buried under houses or on settlement, animals, their heads or parts, possibly associated with immolation ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;Piatra Neamt permanent exposition&lt;/ref&gt;
# a ritual, who consist in  burying (by interment) under dwellings or on settlement of human skulls, bone, sometimes burnt, the deceased with stock,  possibly is also associated with immolation.
# Rituals, associated with use of fire, when into pit, exclusive of ashes get the various things, possibly immolation oddments.  Also some researchers argue, that in some rituals Cucuteni culture has use anthropomorphous, zoomorphous clay figurines,  binocular vessels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iananu.kiev.ua/privatl/pages/Burdo03/NB/articles/sacral.html|title=THE  SACRAL WORLD AND THE MAGIC  SPACE|publisher=Iananu.kiev.ua|accessdate=20 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ringbang''' is variously a [[Caribbean]] [[Fusion (music)|fusion]] of [[music genre]]s, a philosophy, and an [[aesthetic]]&lt;ref name="rollins"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zeeburgnieuws.nl/kofi/kofi-ringbang2.html |title=Eddy Grant Talks About Ringbang |last=Rollins |first=Scott |date= |website=zeeburgnieuws.nl |publisher= |accessdate=23 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130811025314/http://www.zeeburgnieuws.nl/kofi/kofi-ringbang2.html |archivedate=11 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; propounded by [[Eddy Grant]] in 1994.

In an interview circa 2000, Grant defined ringbang like this:
{{cquote|Ringbang is the thing that makes the soul quiet. That in a musical concept is [[rhythm]]. A child is given ringbang when a mother rocks it in her arms. Ringbang allowed the slaves to communicate. Ringbang is a bridge that allows us to stop being insular; it is a concept predicated on our being able to communicate with one another.&lt;ref name="rollins" /&gt;|1.5em|1.5em}}

In applying ringbang to music, Grant attempted to define a meta-style to encompass all Caribbean rhythms; it was to be a musical [[lingua franca]]. He wished this multicultural style to place no restrictions on [[Instrumentation (music)|instrumentation]], and he said that he wanted no single country or culture to lay claim to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icerecords.com/ringbang.html |title=Welcome to ringbang! |last=Grant |first=Eddy |authorlink=Eddy Grant |date= |work=Ringbang |publisher=[[Ice Records]] |accessdate=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among ringbang's stylistic influences are [[Calypso music|calypso]], [[reggae]], [[soca music|soca]], [[tuk band|tuk]], and [[zouk]].

Grant says that the word ''ringbang'' comes from vocalists [[scat singing]] "Ringa-ringa-ringbang!". He chose the word one day in 1993, while standing in recording engineer Frank Agarrat's backyard in [[Trinidad]].&lt;ref name="rollins" /&gt;

==Ringbang music==
In an attempt to popularize ringbang music and its underlying philosophy, Grant asked various recording artists to apply the word (which he [[trademark]]ed)&lt;ref&gt;{{US trademark|76245553}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{US trademark|77388819}}&lt;/ref&gt; to some of their songs. [[Barbadian people|Barbadian]] recording artists [[Grynner]], [[Square One (band)|Square One]], Viking Tundah, and others recorded ringbang tracks for Grant's [[record label]]s, [[Ice Records]] and Blue Wave Records. Among the ringbang albums on these labels were ''Fire in de Wave'' (1994), ''Ringbang Rebel Dance'' (1995), ''Ringbang Souljah'' (1996), and ''Ringbang Revolution'' (1997).

On [[New Year's Eve]] 1999, Grant hosted a concert on [[Tobago]] called Ringbang Celebration 2000, at which he performed with the Frontline Orchestra. The event drew approximately 11,000 people, and featured performances from artists from [[Antigua]], [[Barbados]], and [[Trinidad and Tobago]].&lt;ref name="rollins2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zeeburgnieuws.nl/kofi/kofi-ringbang.html |title=Kofi Ayivor Goes to Celebrate the New Millenium [sic] |last=Rollins |first=Scott |date= |website=zeeburgnieuws.nl |publisher= |accessdate=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calypso legend [[Lord Kitchener (calypsonian)|Lord Kitchener]]'s brief appearance at the event was his final time onstage, as he died the following February.

In March 2003, Ice Records published ''Ringbang 4 Kids'', a selection of songs intended for children of [[primary school]] age. The songs were performed by Barbadian singer Indra Rudder, who had previously sung backing vocals for several Ice Records tracks.

'''Robert Adamson Bone''' (1924 – November 25, 2007)&lt;ref name="tcm4ff"&gt;{{citation|title=TC Mourns Four from Its Faculty|url=http://www.tc.edu/equitycampaign/article.asp?id=6459|series=The Campaign for Educational Equity|publisher=Teachers College, Columbia University|date=December 12, 2007|accessdate=May 14, 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was a scholar of [[African-American literature]] and a professor of English at [[Columbia University]].

==Biography==
Bone was a [[conscientious objector]] during [[World War II]],&lt;ref name="tcm4ff"/&gt; and earned his B.A. in English from [[Yale University]] in 1945. He was National Secretary of the [[Young People’s Socialist League]] from 1946 to 1947, and then from 1947 to 1948 he worked in the automotive industry in [[Flint, Michigan]]. Returning to Yale, he earned a master's degree in [[American studies]] in 1949 and a doctorate in 1955. Bone taught at Yale and at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], before joining the faculty at [[Teachers College, Columbia University|Teachers College, Columbia]], where he taught from 1965 to 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Robert A. Bone Collection|url=http://pocketknowledge.tc.columbia.edu/home.php/browse/27061|publisher=Teachers College, Columbia University|accessdate=May 14, 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
Bone's book ''The Negro Novel in America'', his Yale dissertation, was published in two editions in 1958 and 1965, and translated into [[Japanese language|Japanese]].&lt;ref name="tcm4ff"/&gt; Reviewer August Meier places it within the [[New Criticism]] movement, and calls it a "brilliant and provocative study".&lt;ref name="meier"&gt;{{citation|title=Some Reflections on the Negro Novel|first=August|last=Meier|journal=CLA Journal|volume=2|year=1959|pages=168–177|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SWJu9ZhVThIC&amp;pg=PA124}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In it, Bone identifies four periods of African-American literature: a period of [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] into the white [[middle class]] from 1890 to 1920, the [[Cultural pluralism|pluralism]] of the [[Harlem Renaissance]] in the 1920s, a period of [[Naturalism (literature)|naturalism]] and [[Social protest novel|protest]] during the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s, and a "revolt against protest" in the 1940s. He discusses in detail many novels from each period, reserving particular praise for [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]]'s ''[[Native Son]]'' (1940) and [[Ralph Ellison]]'s ''[[Invisible Man]]'' (1952).&lt;ref name="meier"/&gt;

Bone also wrote ''Down Home: A History of Afro-American Short Fiction from its Beginnings to the End of the Harlem Renaissance'' (Putnam, 1975) and a short book on ''Native Son'' author Richard Wright.&lt;ref name="tcm4ff"/&gt; A manuscript left unfinished at Bone's death was completed by Richard A. Courage and published as ''The Muse in Bronzeville: African American Creative Expression in Chicago, 1932-1950'' (Rutgers University Press, 2011).

Another of Bone's contributions is the name of the "[[Black Chicago Renaissance]]", a period of expansion for [[African-American culture]] in [[Chicago]] prior to World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Writers of the Black Chicago Renaissance |last=Tracy |first=Steven C. |page=1 |year=2011 |publisher=[[University of Illinois Press]] |isbn=978-0-252-03639-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2739">A '''short-title catalogue''' (or catalog) is a [[bibliography|bibliographical]] resource that lists printed items in an abbreviated fashion, recording the most important words of their titles. The term is commonly encountered in the context of [[early modern period|early modern]] books, which frequently have lengthy, descriptive titles on their [[title page]]s. Many short-title catalogues are [[union catalogue]]s, listing items in the custody of multiple libraries.

Online short-title catalogues in fact tend to record complete (and therefore longer) title [[transcription (linguistics)|transcriptions]].

'''''The Bronze Screen''''' directed and produced by [[Nancy De Los Santos]], [[Susan Racho]], and [[Alberto Dominguez]], examines, analyzes, and critiques the portrayal of [[Latino (demonym)|Latinos]] in Hollywood over the course of a century.&lt;ref&gt;Rovi LeVasseur Andrea, http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/271876/The-Bronze-Screen-100-Years-of-the-Latino-Image-in-Hollywood/overview, "The Bronze Screen: 100 Years of the Latino Image in Hollywood (2002), June 2, 2012."&lt;/ref&gt; Released in 2002, the documentary traces the different stereotypes evoked by Hollywood throughout the mid 19th and 20th century.&lt;ref name=Speier&gt;Speier, Michael. (2002). "The Bronze Screen: 100 Years of the Latino Image in Hollywood Cinema." ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; This is done through the use of silent films and small excerpts from a variety of movie genres that feature Latinos. [[Carmen Miranda]] and [[Margarita Cansino]] (popularly known as [[Rita Hayworth]]) are a few of the many Latin actors and actresses whose careers, according to film historians, directors, and fellow actors featured in the documentary, were fabricated and highly manipulated by Hollywood.&lt;ref name=Racho&gt;De, L. S. N., Racho, S., De, J. W. (2002). Bronze Screen Productions., Latino Entertainment Media Institute., &amp; Questar, Inc. ''The Bronze Screen: 100 Years of the Latino Image in Hollywood''.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, these actresses are used to illustrate the politics behind American Cinema and Latino/a negative representations in Hollywood.&lt;ref name=Speier /&gt; In addition to exploring stereotypes and negative representations of Latinos, ''The Bronze Screen'' also acknowledges the contribution and emergence of Latino writers, directors, cinematographers, composers, and graphic designers. [[Luis Valdez]], [[Pablo Ferro]], [[Montezuma Esparza]], and [[John Alfonzo]] are a few, among the many featured in the documentary, that have paved the way for other Latinos who want to work in the industry, as well as, portrayed Latinos in a more positive manner through their films.&lt;ref name=Racho /&gt;

==Structure and content==
The documentary is divided into twenty-one sections that consist of Hollywood's first bad guy, enter the Latin lover, if you talk like deez, the grave yard shift, escaping the depression, no seas tonto (don’t be stupid), some kind of hero, good neighbor policy, the name game, cow boys and Mexicans, the Latin lover return, the blacklist, border clashes, the Cesar returned, something's coming the sixties, meanwhile behind the camera, the "s" word, the urban greaser, from silver to bronze, and el futuro.  A stereotype, actor or actress is examined in each section. The first section begins by looking at silent films and their use of Mexican men as the bad guys and Mexican women as bad girls with loose morals.&lt;ref name=Racho /&gt;

In the sections that follow stereotypes such as the greaser, the Latin lover, the tonto (dumb), the bandido (bandit), the lazy Mexican, and the gangster are identified in various Hollywood films. The "if you talk like deez" section focuses on the Latino accent. According to the documentary the introduction of talkies ended the careers of many Latino actors. Latino males went from playing lead roles in silent films to playing supporting roles because of their accent. In "the grave yard shift" [[Lupe Vélez]] recalls her experience as an actress working the night shift. She goes on to explain that the Spanish versions of films were shot at night while the English version was shot during the day. Yet another obstacles Latinos have faced in Hollywood. Instead of focusing on stereotypes "the name game" section consist of the obstacles Latino actors and Latina actresses have had to face in regards to their names. The actors and actresses interviewed in this section all said to have experienced a moment in their careers in which their managers or someone in the industry suggested that they changed their name to something more American. They, however, refused to change their names because to them their names form part of their identities as actors and actresses. The last four sections of the documentary which include "something's coming the sixties", "meanwhile behind the camera", "from silver to bronze", and "el futuro" (the future) all examine the positive changes Latinos have made in Hollywood and the changes they continue to push for. Moreover, these last four sections show that Latinos in the film industry have redefined their role in Hollywood by producing, writing, and directing their own films.&lt;ref name=Racho /&gt;

==Reception==
The ''[[Library Journal]]'' wrote that ''The Bronze Screen'' is a fascinating documentary about the Latino in Hollywood from the first roles in the early 1900s to the present; the film could be used as a collection development tool for building a Latino film collection. The reviewer recommends the documentary for all academic and public libraries with Latin American studies and film studies collections. They noted that some of the comprehensive methods used include the filmmakers interviewing 15 actors, including [[Edward James Olmos]] and [[Rita Moreno]]. The review further explains, ten people that work in production positions behind the scenes are interviewed, including [[Gregory Nava]], director of ''[[Selena]]''. The writer goes on to say that the four film scholars interviewed offered insights into the stereotypes and the past and future of Latinos in the American cinema industry.&lt;ref name=Johnston&gt;Johnston, Lisa N. Ed. Fox, Bette-Lee. (2003). "The Bronze Screen (Film)". ''[[Library Journal]]'', 128, 131.&lt;/ref&gt;

They wrote that the ethnic stereotypes portrayed in the documentary include the greaser, the lazy Mexican, the dark mysterious lady, the Latin lover, the spitfire, the violent gang leader, and the non-English-speaking cleaning woman. They also write that the film's structure in chapters give the film continuity, featuring a myriad of clips and stills, both familiar and rare, along with exceptional sound and film quality.&lt;ref name=Johnston /&gt;

The ''[[School Library Journal]]'' described the film as, "compelling, enlightening, and entertaining."&lt;ref name=Moxley&gt;Moxley, Melody. Ed. Mandell, Phyllis Levy. (2003). "The Bronze Screen". ''[[School Library Journal]]'', 49, 62-62.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Bronze Screen'' relates the contributions made by Latinos to movies, from silent to contemporary films, with examples of the many ways Latinos have been portrayed. They elaborated on the film's format: "The loosely chronological structure allows viewers to compare and contrast the films and those who inhabit and create them".&lt;ref name=Moxley /&gt; The reviewer emphasizes part of the significance of this film: "No look at the history of Hollywood would be complete without this documentary, which should be widely viewed by anyone interested in the history of movies".&lt;ref name=Moxley /&gt;

The writer explains that the documentary gives their view of the past and how the images of Latinos in Hollywood have shifted over time. The reviewer further describes the way in which the various stereotypes that have developed and evolved (such as the Latin Lover and the greaser) in American cinema are explored and enhanced with examples throughout the documentary. The reviewer also underlines that other film historians provide cogent commentary throughout.&lt;ref name=Moxley /&gt;

Journalist Robert Dominguez gives his review of the film in the "Que Pasa" (what's happening) section of the newspaper, the ''[[New York Daily News]]'': "As a documentary chronicling a little-known and underappreciated aspect of film history, ''The Bronze Screen: 100 Years of the Latino Image in Hollywood Cinema'' is as comprehensive as its title suggests".&lt;ref name=Dominguez&gt;Dominguez, Robert. (2003). "The Latin Role in H’wood." ''[[New York Daily News]]''. http://articles.nydailynews.com/2003-0227/entertainment/18221848_1_latino-history-latino-themed-silent-era&lt;/ref&gt; Occupying the seat as the main highlight of Harlem's 2003 Film Festival, the writer says, "Yet the main appeal of "The Bronze Screen" is what co-producer Nancy De Los Santos jokingly calls its "No s--!" factor—fascinating tidbits of information "that make people go, ‘No s--! I didn’t know that’".&lt;ref name=Dominguez /&gt; The review highlights the scholarship that was done by the film's creators De Los Santos, along with co-producers Alberto Dominguez and Susan Racho, who spent more than 10 years researching and making The Bronze Screen. The writer quotes De Los Santos saying, "The three of us have worked in Hollywood for 25 years, yet we didn’t even know the history of all the wonderful contributions Latinos have made".&lt;ref name=Dominguez /&gt; The review further quotes De Los Santos: "There are a lot of surprises for everybody in this film".&lt;ref name=Dominguez /&gt; These include the fact that it was two Mexican brothers that designed the movable [[King Kong]] model in the 1931 film. The writer describes other examples like these from the film, like some of the classic horror films, such as ''[[Dracula]]'' were filmed in Spanish-language versions on the same set in the middle of the night after the American cast and crew went home. Another example includes the political economics of the early 20th century: "a fed-up Mexican government that boycotted Hollywood films in the 1920s because Mexicans were constantly being portrayed as rapists, killers and outlaws".&lt;ref name=Dominguez /&gt; The review quotes De Los Santos saying, "People think of us as playing maids and gang members and all the other negative images. We wanted to reveal all the positive things we’ve done as a community".&lt;ref name=Dominguez /&gt; De Los Santos further reveals, "What I loved most about doing this is that it's Latinos documenting Latino history".&lt;ref name=Dominguez /&gt;

Journalist Michael Speier reviews the documentary for the newspaper, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'': "The documentary covers the politics behind early distribution patterns, and the manipulation of actors, among other topics".&lt;ref name=Speier /&gt; The reviewer notes that a respectable amount of time is spent highlighting contributions made by multiple job levels and sectors, from composers, d.p.'s, to graphic designers. The writer notes that among the film's chapters, there's "The Graveyard Shift," describing producers’ early inclinations to shoot two separate language versions, "with the Spanish-speaking thesps and crew coming in at night and working until morning".&lt;ref name=Speier /&gt; Speier expands that the chapter, "Escaping the Depression," talks of the subtle shift in the dominant portrayal of Latinos: "during the 1930s toward playing Hispanics only as wealthy South Americans who comprise a fantasy world inhabited by "attractive" performers like [[Dolores del Río|Del Rio]]".&lt;ref name=Speier /&gt; He goes on to mention the relationship between the Hollywood film industry and the president's administration of foreign policy in the documentary's chapter, "Hollywood's First Bad Guy," where, "President [[Woodrow Wilson]] is cheekily cited for helping trade relations by imploring studios to ‘be a little kinder to the Mexicans’ after Latin America banned films that made its people dumb and violent ‘greasers’".&lt;ref name=Speier /&gt;

Speier criticizes that the documentary does not spend enough time on the vital periods it covers. Speier adds while, "[[Ricardo Montalbán]]," one of the actors interviewed, "refused to be renamed Ricky Martin, yet his views on prejudice—and he must have some—are not fully developed".&lt;ref name=Speier /&gt; Speier goes on to say, "[[Anthony Quinn]] left for Europe after his ''[[Viva Zapata]]'' Oscar because he was more "accepted" there, as most Latino thesps are, yet that collective trek is almost completely ignored".&lt;ref name=Speier /&gt; Speier also critiques that there are several big names missing from the documentary, including Jennifer Lopez, Andy García and Selma Hayek.&lt;ref name=Speier /&gt;

Journalist Bob Graham for the newspaper, the ''[[SFGate]]'' reviews this documentary, whose screening opened up the 9th Annual Festival Cine Latino in 2001. Graham describes the documentary as, "a history of Latino contribution to American film".&lt;ref name=Graham&gt;Graham, Bob. (2001). "’Bronze Screen’ focus of Cine Latino/Documentary sets tone for film festival." ''[[SFGate]]''. http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2001/09/10/DD2898.DTL&lt;/ref&gt; The review highlights how several actors talk about how they refused to change their name to something less ethnic, but that there were others who did, for example, [[Rita Hayworth]].&lt;ref name=Graham /&gt;

The writer further describes the actress’ transformation: "as one of the most glamorous starts of American movies, [[Hayworth]]'s heritage—concealed by the studios during her heyday in the 1940s—has since become the subject verging on myth. The review describes how the myth motivated physical changes: "She kept that name for her first 10 movies when, according to the documentary, she was "de-Latinized" and turned into the glamorous figure we remember today. Her name was changed and her hair lightened".&lt;ref name=Graham /&gt;

In an interview from 2009 on ''[[LatinoLA]]'', De Los Santos was asked what she considered to be her greatest work so far. She responded: "While I do love all the work I have written or produced, I think the contribution of the feature-length documentary is a huge contribution to our history and the Latino legacy in Hollywood. I am very proud of that documentary".&lt;ref&gt;Carlos, Al Hernandez. (2009). "Nancy De Los Santos: a Latina Writer, Period." ''LatinoLA''. http://latinola.com/story.php?story=8051&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Theodric Romeyn Beck''' (April 11, 1791 – November 19, 1855), alternatively '''Theodoric Romeyn Beck''' or '''T. Romeyn Beck''', was an [[United States|American]] physician in [[Albany, NY|Albany]], [[New York (state)|New York]] specializing in [[medical jurisprudence]] who authored the first significant American book on [[forensic medicine]], ''Elements of Medical Jurisprudence'' in 1823.

==Biography==
Beck was born in [[Schenectady, New York]], to the family of Caleb Beck of English descent. He graduated from [[Union College]] at the age of 16 and the [[Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons]] with an [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] at the age of 20 before going into practice in [[Albany, NY|Albany]] in 1811.  In 1813 he presented to the Albany Society of Arts a comprehensive paper on the mineral resources of the United States.  In 1815 he was appointed professor of the institutes of medicine, and lecturer on medical jurisprudence in the [[Fairfield Academy|College of Physicians and Surgeons of Western New York]], at [[Fairfield, New York|Fairfield]]. Blake was also elected a member of the [[American Antiquarian Society]] in 1815.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanantiquarian.org/memberlist American Antiquarian Society Members Directory]&lt;/ref&gt;  He served as the [[Principal (school)|Principal]] of [[The Albany Academy]] from 1817 to 1848, where he encouraged the future curator of the [[Smithsonian Institution]], [[Joseph Henry]], to enroll as a student and later serve as a professor of mathematics and [[natural philosophy]] in 1826.  Also during this time, he was a professor of medical jurisprudence at Fairfield Medical College from 1826 until 1836, and professor of [[materia medica]] in that institution from 1836 till 1840, and at [[Albany Medical College]] from 1840 until 1854.

[[File:Elements of Medical Jurisprudence.jpg|thumb|left|''Elements of Medical Jurisprudence'']] In 1823, while secretary of the Society for the Promotion of Useful Arts (SPUA), he founded the Albany Lyceum of Natural History, which  focused on the preservation of mineral and botanical specimens collected in New York State surveys.  The following year, SPUA and the Albany Lyceum of Natural History merged to form the Albany Institute; [[Stephen Van Rensselaer III]] was appointed its President and Beck was appointed its Vice President.   He was chosen [[President]] of the New York State Medical Society in 1829, and became a manager of the state [[lunatic asylum]] before becoming President of the Board of Managers in 1854.  During his service, he collected statistics on deaf-mutes, which influenced the legislature to pass laws for the education of the [[mentally ill]].  In addition, from 1849 to 1853 he edited the ''American Journal of Insanity''.

His principal work was ''Elements of Medical Jurisprudence''. His brother [[John Brodhead Beck]], also a physician, contributed the material on infanticide.  The first edition was printed in 1823, a seventh edition was issued in [[London]] in 1842, with notes by Dunlap and Darwell, and a tenth in [[Albany, NY|Albany]] in 1850.

Beck also contributed to numerous scientific journals.  Another of his brothers, [[Lewis Caleb Beck]], wrote a noted book on the ''Mineralogy of New York'' (1842).

'''''Tidsskrift for Rettsvitenskap''''' (English: "Journal of Jurisprudence") is a Norwegian [[law journal]]. It was established in 1888 by [[Francis Hagerup]] to "form a link between legal research in the [[Nordic countries]]" and is currently published by [[Universitetsforlaget]]. The journal is one of Scandinavia's preeminent academic journals in the field of law.&lt;ref&gt;Internasjonal politikk, Volum 65, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; It is ranked as a Level 2 journal, the highest level in the official Norwegian ranking (the [[Norwegian Scientific Index]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dbh.nsd.uib.no/kanaler/kanalDetalj.do?produktid=340946 |title=Publiseringskanaler |publisher=Dbh.nsd.uib.no |date= |accessdate=2012-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Articles are published in the three Scandinavian languages: Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish.

The original spelling of the journal name was ''Tidsskrift for Retsvidenskab'', which was changed to ''Tidsskrift for Rettsvidenskap'' in 1932 and to ''Tidsskrift for Rettsvitenskap'' in 1940, i.e. from a Danish spelling to a modern Norwegian spelling.

== Laws ==

===Convention to Eliminate All Forms of Discrimination Against Women===
The United States has never ratified the U.N.'s [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women]], although it played an important role in drafting the treaty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/03/08/opinion/baldez-womens-equality-treaty/|title=U.S. drops the ball on women's rights - CNN|last=CNN|first=By Lisa Baldez, Special to|date=|website=cnn.com|accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cedaw2014.org/index.php/whats-in-it-for-us|title=cedaw2014.org – Just another WordPress site|author=|date=|website=cedaw2014.org|accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2014, the United States is thus one of only seven nations which have not ratified it – also including Iran, Palau, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, and Tonga.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cedaw2014.org/index.php/about-cedaw|title=cedaw2014.org – Just another WordPress site|author=|date=|website=cedaw2014.org|accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Equal Rights Amendment===
The United States has ratified the [[Equal Rights Amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.equalrightsamendment.org/|title=ERA: Home|author=|date=|website=www.equalrightsamendment.org|accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marriage ===
Child marriage, as defined by [[UNICEF]], is observed in the United States. The UNICEF definition of child marriage includes couples who are formally married, or who live together as a sexually active couple in an informal union, with at least one member — usually the girl — being less than 18 years old. &lt;ref name="Child Marriage"&gt;[http://www.unicef.org/protection/57929_58008.html Child Marriage] UNICEF (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="icrwchild"&gt;[http://www.icrw.org/what-we-do/adolescents/child-marriage Child Marriage] ICRW (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; The latter practice is more common in the United States, and it is officially called [[cohabitation]]. Laws regarding child marriage vary in the different states of the United States. Generally, children 16 and over may marry with parental consent, with the age of 18 being the minimum in all but two states to marry without parental consent. Those under 16 generally require a court order in addition to parental consent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=www.usmarriagelaws.com|url=http://www.usmarriagelaws.com/search/united_states/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parental leave===
The United States is the only high income country not to provide required paid [[parental leave]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/23/your-money/us-trails-much-of-the-world-in-providing-paid-family-leave.html|title=In Paid Family Leave, U.S. Trails Most of the Globe|date=February 22, 2013|accessdate=2013-05-07|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sex discrimination has been outlawed in non-ministerial employment in the United States since 1964 nationwide; however, under a judicially created doctrine called the "ministerial exemption," religious organizations are immune from sex discrimination suits brought by "ministerial employees," a category that includes such religious roles as priests, imams or kosher supervisors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/featured_documents/amendment_19/ |title=Featured Document: The 19th Amendment |publisher=Archives.gov |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ministerial"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4247&amp;context=flr| title=Above the Law?
