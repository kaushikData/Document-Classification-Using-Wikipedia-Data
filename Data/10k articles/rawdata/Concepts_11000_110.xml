'''''Arete''''' ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: [[wikt:ἀρετή|ἀρετή]]), in its basic sense, means "excellence of any kind".&lt;ref name="LSJ"&gt;[[Henry Liddell|Liddell, H.G.]] &amp; [[Robert Scott (philologist)|Scott, R.]] ''[[A Greek–English Lexicon]]'', 9th ed. (Oxford, 1940), [[Sub voce#sub verbo|s.v.]] [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=LSJ%20a)reth/&amp;lang=original {{lang|grc|ἀρετή}}].&lt;/ref&gt; The term may also mean "moral virtue".&lt;ref name="LSJ"/&gt; In its earliest appearance in [[Greek language|Greek]], this notion of excellence was ultimately bound up with the notion of the fulfillment of purpose or function: the act of living up to one's full potential.

The term from [[Homeric]] times onwards is not gender specific. Homer applies the term of both the Greek and Trojan heroes as well as major female figures, such as [[Penelope]], the wife of the Greek hero [[Odysseus]]. In the Homeric poems, Arete is frequently associated with bravery, but more often with effectiveness. The person of Arete is of the highest effectiveness; they use all their faculties—strength, bravery, and wit—to achieve real results. In the Homeric world, then, Arete involves all of the abilities and potentialities available to humans.

In some contexts, Arete is explicitly linked with human knowledge, where the expressions "virtue is knowledge" and "Arete is knowledge" are used interchangeably. The highest human potential is knowledge and all other human abilities are derived from this central capacity. If Arete is knowledge and study, the highest human knowledge is knowledge about knowledge itself; in this light, the theoretical study of human knowledge, which Aristotle called "contemplation", is the highest human ability and happiness.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Hooker {{cite web|url=http://www.wsu.edu:8080/~dee/GLOSSARY/ARETE.HTM |accessdate=March 13, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104052613/http://www.wsu.edu:8080/~dee/GLOSSARY/ARETE.HTM |title=Areté |archivedate=January 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The [[Ancient Greeks]] applied the term to anything: for example, the excellence of a chimney, the excellence of a bull for breeding, and the excellence of a man.  The meaning of the word changes depending on what it describes since everything has its own peculiar excellence; the ''arete'' of a man is different from the ''arete'' of a horse.  This way of thinking comes first from [[Plato]], where it can be seen in the [[Allegory of the Cave]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/GREECE/ALLEGORY.HTM Greek Philosophy: The Allegory of the Cave, The Divided Line] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061116162350/http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/GREECE/ALLEGORY.HTM |date=November 16, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular, the [[aristocracy|aristocratic class]] was presumed, essentially by definition, to be exemplary of ''arete'': "The root of the word is the same as ''aristos'', the word which shows superlative ability and superiority, and ''aristos'' was constantly used in the plural to denote the [[nobility]]."&lt;ref&gt;''Paideia; the Ideals of Greek Culture'', [[Werner Jaeger]], Oxford University Press, NY, 1945. Vol. I, pg 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 5th and 4th centuries BC, ''arete'' as applied to men had developed to include quieter virtues, such as ''dikaiosyne'' ([[justice]]) and ''[[sophrosyne]]'' (self-restraint).  [[Plato]] attempted to produce a [[moral philosophy]] that incorporated this new usage,&lt;ref&gt;And in so doing, developed ideas that played a central part in later [[Christian]] thought&lt;/ref&gt; but it was in the work of [[Aristotle]] that the doctrine  of ''arete'' found its fullest flowering. Aristotle's ''[[Nicomachean Ethics|Doctrine of the Mean]]'' is a paradigm example of his thinking.

''Arete'' has also been used by Plato when talking about athletic training and also the education of young boys. Stephen G. Miller delves into this usage in his book ''Ancient Greek Athletics''. Aristotle is quoted as deliberating between education towards ''arete'' "...or those that are theoretical".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Stephen|title=Arete: Greek Sports from Ancient Sources|year=2004|publisher=University of California Press|location=London, England|isbn=978-0520241541|pages=149–152}}&lt;/ref&gt; Educating towards ''arete'' in this sense means that the boy would be educated towards things that are useful in life. However, even Plato himself says that ''arete'' is not something that can be agreed upon. He says, "Nor is there even an agreement about what constitutes ''arete'', something that leads logically to a disagreement about the appropriate training for ''arete''."&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;Miller 2004&lt;/ref&gt; To say that ''arete'' has a common definition of excellence or fulfillment may be an overstatement simply because it was very difficult to pinpoint ''arete'', much less the proper ways to go about obtaining it.

==Athletics==
It was commonly believed that the mind, body, and soul each had to be developed and prepared for a man to live a life of arete. This led to the thought that athletics had to be present in order to obtain arete. They did not need to consume one's life, merely exercise the body into the right condition for arete, just like the mind and soul would be exercised by other means.&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt;

==Homer==
In [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]'', "''arete''" is used mainly to describe [[hero]]es and nobles and their mobile dexterity, with special reference to [[Physical strength|strength]] and [[courage]], but it is not limited to this.  [[Penelope]]'s ''arete'', for example, relates to [[co-operation]], for which she is praised by [[Agamemnon]].  The excellence of the gods generally included their power, but, in the ''Odyssey'' (13.42), the gods can grant excellence to a life, which is contextually understood to mean prosperity.  [[Arete (mythology)|Arete]] was also the name of [[Alcinous|King Alcinous]]'s wife.

According to [[Bernard Knox]]'s notes found in the [[Robert Fagles]] translation of ''The Odyssey'', "arete" is also associated with the Greek word for "pray", ''araomai''.&lt;ref&gt;Homer. The Odyssey. trans. by Robert Fagles. Introduction and notes by Bernard Knox. Penguin Classics Deluxe Ed, London. 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

In regards to the Iliad the way Homer describes Achilles is an example of Arete (187). Arete is associated with the goodness and prowess of a warrior (187). Debra Hawhee points out that the norms and practices of Athenian virtuosity “operate within the politics of reputation, whose normative poles are honor and shame” (187). This means Arete functions as an external phenomenon depending on outside reception and acknowledgement for its instantiation (188). Dying in battle or securing a victory in the Olympic Games were considered ''agathos'' (good) and, hence, deserving of ''timê'' (honor).  So, not only is Achilles a brave and brilliant warrior but also, from the outset, he is destined to die in battle at Troy with the utmost glory—a guarantor of Arete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hawhee|first=Debra|title=Agonism and Arete|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/par/summary/v035/35.3hawhee.html|accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personification==
{{Further|Virtus (deity)}}
Arete was occasionally personified as a [[Arete (goddess)|goddess]], the sister of [[Homonoia (mythology)|Homonoia]] (not to be confused with [[Harmonia (mythology)|Harmonia]]), and the daughter of the goddess of [[justice]], [[Praxidike]].

Arete and Homonoia were known jointly as the ''Praxidikai'' (Exacters of Justice).  As with many minor Greek deities, there is little or no real mythical background to Arete, who is used at most as a personification of virtue.

The only story involving Arete was originally told in the 5th century BC by the [[sophist]] [[Prodicus]], and concerns the early life of the [[hero]] [[Heracles]]. At a crossroads, Arete appeared to Heracles as a young maiden, and offered him glory and a life of struggle against evil; her counterpart [[Kakia (mythology)|Kakia]] (κακία, "badness"), offered him wealth and pleasure. Heracles chose to follow the path of Arete.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

This story was later used by [[Christianity|Christian]] writers, such as [[Methodius of Olympus]], [[Justin Martyr]], [[Clement of Alexandria]], and [[Basil of Caesarea]]. Justin and Basil portray Arete as a squalidly dressed and unattractive figure,{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} but Methodius portrays her positively in ''[[Banquet of the Ten Virgins]]''.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

==Paideia==
Arete is a significant part of the [[paideia]] of ancient Greeks: the training of the boy to manhood. This training in arete included [[physical training]], for which the Greeks developed the [[Gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasion]]; mental training, which included [[Public speaking|oratory]], [[rhetoric]], and [[basic science]]s; and [[spirituality|spiritual]] training, which included [[music]] and what is called [[virtue]].

==Examples of usage==
* "Virtue (''arete'') then is a settled disposition of the mind determining the choice of actions and emotions, consisting essentially in the observance of the mean relative to us, this being determined by principle, that is, as the prudent man would determine it."&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle's ''Nicomachean Ethics'', II vi 15, translated H. Rackham (1934: Cambridge, Massachusetts, Harvard University Press)&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Finally, brethren, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is gracious, if there is any excellence (''arete''), if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things" (the Admonition of Paul in Philippians).&lt;ref&gt;''New Testament'', Philippians 4.8&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Robert Pirsig]] uses "arete" as a synonym for Quality in his book ''[[Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance]]''. This includes an extensive discussion of Plato's "Phaedrus" and the historical contrast between Dialectic and Rhetoric. "And what is good, Phaedrus, And what is not good—Need we ask anyone to tell us these things?" Pirsig's line plays off a line in the Platonic dialogue ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|The Phaedrus]]'' which reads: "And what is well and what is badly—need we ask Lysias, or any other poet or orator, who ever wrote or will write either a political or any other work, in metre or out of metre, poet or prose writer, to teach us this?"&lt;ref&gt;Translated by Benjamin Jowett&lt;/ref&gt;
* "O father Zeus, give honor to this hymn for a victor at Olympia, and to his now famous ''arete'' in boxing". From a Pindarian ode inscribed on an Olympic victor's statue of Diagoras of Rhodes that is set up in Olympia.&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt;
* Arete is the name of a key protagonist in [[The Philosopher Kings (novel)|''The Philosopher Kings'']], the second book of [[Jo Walton]]'s [[The Just City|''Thessaly trilogy'']] in which a group of people gathered by the [[time-traveling]] [[goddess]] [[Athena]] work to achieve the ideal society as described in [[Republic (Plato)|Plato's ''Republic'']]. She is a precocious teenager who also appears in the sequel. Arete's name and its meaning ("excellence") is a small but important plot point in the book - as well as a general theme of the series as a whole.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15840">'''Behavioral momentum''' is a theory in [[quantitative analysis of behavior]] and is a behavioral [[metaphor]] based on physical [[momentum]]. It describes the general relation between resistance to change (persistence of behavior) and the [[rate of reinforcement]] obtained in a given situation.

[[B.F. Skinner]] (1938) proposed that all behavior is based on a fundamental unit of behavior called the discriminated operant. The discriminated operant, also known as the three-term contingency, has three components: an antecedent discriminative stimulus, a response, and a reinforcing or punishing consequence. The organism responds in the presence of the [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]] because past responses in the presence of that stimulus have produced reinforcement. 

==Resistance to change==
According to behavioral momentum theory, there are two separable factors that independently govern the rate with which a discriminated operant occurs and the persistence of that response in the face of disruptions such as punishment, extinction, or the differential reinforcement of alternative behaviors. (see [[John Anthony Nevin|Nevin]] &amp; Grace, 2000, for a review). First, the positive contingency between the response and a reinforcing consequence controls response rates (i.e., a response–reinforcer relation) by shaping a particular pattern of responding. This is governed by the relative law of effect (i.e., the [[matching law]]; [[Richard Herrnstein|Herrnstein]], 1970). Secondly, the [[Pavlovian]] relation between surrounding, or context, stimuli and the rate or magnitude (but not both) of reinforcement obtained in the context (i.e., a stimulus–reinforcer relation) governs the resistance of the behavior to operations such as extinction. Resistance to change is assessed by measuring responding during operations such as extinction or satiation that tend to disrupt the behavior and comparing these measurements to stable, pre-disruption response rates. 

Resistance to disruption has been considered a better measure of response strength than a simple measure of response rate.(Nevin, 1974). This is because variations in reinforcement contingencies such as differential-reinforcement-of-high- or low-response-rate schedules can yield highly variable response rates even though overall reinforcement rates are equal. Thus it is questionable whether these differences in response rates indicate differences in the underlying strength of a response (see Morse, 1966, for a discussion).

According to behavioral momentum theory, the relation between response rate and resistance to change is analogous to the relation between [[velocity]] and [[mass]] of a moving object, according to [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s [[second law of motion]] (Nevin, Mandell &amp; Atak, 1983). Newton's second law states that the change in velocity of an object when a force is applied is directly related to that force and inversely related to the object's mass. Similarly, behavioral momentum theory states that the change in response rate under conditions of disruption (''Bx'') relative to baseline response rate (''Bo'') is directly related to the force or magnitude of disruption (''f'') and inversely related to the rate of reinforcement in a stimulus context (''r''):
:&lt;math&gt;\log{\left({Bx\over Bo}\right)}\ = \ -\left({f\over r^b}\right)&lt;/math&gt;{{spaces|8}}(1)

The free parameter ''b'' indicates the sensitivity of resistance to change to the rate of reinforcement in the stimulus context (i.e., the stimulus–reinforcer relation). Resistance to disruption typically is assessed when two distinctive discriminative stimulus contexts alternate and signal different schedules of reinforcement (i.e., a multiple schedule). Equation 1 can be rewritten to account for resistance to change across two stimulus contexts (Nevin, 1992; Nevin, Grace, &amp; McLean, 2001) when a disrupter is uniformly applied across contexts (i.e., ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;):
:&lt;math&gt;{ {\log(Bx_1/Bo_1)} \over{\log(Bx_2/Bo_2)} }\ = \ \left({r_2\over r_1}\right)^a&lt;/math&gt;{{spaces|7}}(2)

The subscripts indicate the different stimulus contexts. Thus, Equation 2 states that relative resistance to change is a power function of the relative rate of reinforcement across stimulus contexts, with the ''a'' parameter indicating sensitivity to relative reinforcement rate. Consistent with behavioral momentum theory, resistance to disruption often has been found to be greater in stimulus contexts that signal higher rates or magnitudes of reinforcement (see Nevin, 1992, for a review). Studies that add response-independent (i.e., free) reinforcement to one stimulus context strongly support the theory that changes in response strength are determined by stimulus–reinforcer relations and are independent of response–reinforcer relations. For instance, Nevin, Tota, Torquato, and Shull (1990) had pigeons pecking lighted disks on separate variable-interval 60-s schedules of intermittent food reinforcement across two components of a multiple schedule. Additional free reinforcers were presented every 15 or 30 s on average when the disk was red, but not when the disk was green. Thus, the response–reinforcer relation was degraded when the disk was red because each reinforcer was not immediately preceded by a response. Consistent with the matching law, response rates were lower in the red context than in the green context. However, the stimulus–reinforcer relation was enhanced in the red context because the overall rate of food presentation was greater. Consistent with behavioral momentum theory, resistance to presession feeding (satiation) and discontinuing reinforcement in both contexts (extinction) was greater in the red context. Similar results have been found when reinforcers are added to a context by reinforcing an alternative response.

The findings of Nevin et al. (1990) have been extended across a number of procedures and species including goldfish (Igaki &amp; Sakagami, 2004), rats (Harper, 1999a, 1999b; Shull, Gaynor &amp; Grimes, 2001), pigeons (Podlesnik &amp; Shahan, 2008), and humans (Ahearn, Clark, Gardenier, Chung &amp; Dube, 2003; Cohen, 1996; Mace et al., 1990). The behavioral momentum framework also has been used to account for the partial-reinforcement extinction effect (Nevin &amp; Grace, 1999), to assess the persistence of drug-maintained behavior (Jimenez-Gomez &amp; Shahan, 2007; Shahan &amp; Burke, 2004), to increase task compliance (e.g., Belfiore, Lee, Scheeler &amp; Klein, 2002), and to understand the effects of social policies on global problems (Nevin, 2005).

Although behavioral momentum theory is a powerful framework for understanding how a context of reinforcement can affect the persistence of discriminated operant behavior, there are a number of findings that are inconsistent with the theory (see Nevin &amp; Grace, 2000, and accompanying commentary). For instance, with equal reinforcement rates across stimulus contexts, resistance to change has been shown to be affected by manipulations to response–reinforcer relations, including schedules that produce different baseline response rates (e.g., Lattal, 1989; Nevin, Grace, Holland &amp; McLean), delays to reinforcement (e.g., Bell, 1999; Grace, Schwendimann &amp; Nevin, 1998; Podlesnik, Jimenez-Gomez, Ward &amp; Shahan, 2006; Podlesnik &amp; Shahan, 2008), and by providing brief stimuli that accompany reinforcement (Reed &amp; Doughty, 2005). Also, it is unclear what factors affect relative resistance to change of responding maintained by conditioned reinforcement (Shahan &amp; Podlesnik, 2005) or two concurrently available responses when different rates of reinforcement are arranged within the same context for those responses (e.g., Bell &amp; Williams, 2002).

==Preference and resistance to change==
As resistance to disruption across stimulus contexts is analogous to the inertial mass of a moving object, behavioral momentum theory also suggests that preference in concurrent-chains procedures for one stimulus context over another is analogous to the gravitational attraction of two bodies (see Nevin &amp; Grace, 2000). In concurrent-chains procedures, responding on the concurrently available initial links provides access to one of two mutually exclusive stimulus contexts called terminal links. As with multiple schedules, independent schedules of reinforcement can function in each terminal-link context. The relative allocation of responding across the two initial links indicates the extent to which an organism prefers one terminal-link context over the other. Moreover, behavioral momentum theory posits that preference provides a measure of the relative conditioned-reinforcing value of the two terminal-link contexts, as described by the contextual-choice model (Grace, 1994).

Grace and Nevin (1997) assessed both relative resistance to change in a multiple schedule and preference in a concurrent-chains procedure with pigeons pecking lighted disks for food reinforcement. When the relative rate of reinforcement was manipulated identically and simultaneously across stimulus contexts in the multiple schedule and concurrent-chains procedure, both relative resistance to change and preference was greater with richer contexts of reinforcement. When all the extant resistance to change and preference data were summarized by Grace, Bedell, and Nevin (2002), they found that those measures were related by a structural relation slope of 0.29. Therefore, relative resistance to change and preference both have been conceptualized as expressions of an underlying construct termed response strength, conditioned reinforcement value, or more generally, behavioral mass of discriminated operant behavior (see Nevin &amp; Grace, 2000).

[[File:Hjalmars avsked av Orvar Odd efter striden på Samsö.jpg|right|300px|thumb|The Norwegian warrior [[Örvar-Oddr]] bids a last farewell to his blood brother, the Swedish warrior [[Hjalmar]], by [[Mårten Eskil Winge]] (1866).]]
'''Blood brother''' can refer to one of two things: a male [[Kinship|related by birth]], or two or more men not related by [[birth]] who have sworn loyalty to each other. This is in modern times usually done in a ceremony, known as a '''blood [[oath]]''', where each person makes a small cut, usually on a finger, hand or the [[forearm]], and then the two cuts are pressed together and bound, the idea being that each person's blood now flows in the other participant's [[veins]]. The act may carry a risk due to [[blood-borne disease]]s. In modern times, some gangs have also been rumored to make blood pacts. The process usually provides a participant with a heightened symbolic sense of attachment with another participant.

==Cultures==

===Scandinavia===

The Norsemen entering into the pact of foster brotherhood ({{lang-is|[[:is:Fóstbræðralag|Fóstbræðralag]]}}) involved a rite whereby they let their blood flow while they ducked underneath an arch formed by a strip of turf propped up by a spear or spears. An example is described in ''[[Gísla saga]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Poole |first=Russell |author-link=Russell Poole |title=Claiming Kin Skaldic-Style |work=Verbal Encounters: Anglo-Saxon and Old Norse Studies for Roberta Frank |publisher=University of Toronto Press |year=2005 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F8naeLlWGikC&amp;pg=PA278 |page=278 |isbn=9780802080110}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref={{SfnRef|Dasent|1866}}|translator=George Webbe Dasent|translator-link=George Webbe Dasent |others=Mildmay, C.

''[[Örvar-Oddr's saga]]'' contains another notable account of blood brotherhood. [[Örvar-Oddr]], after fighting the renowned Swedish warrior [[Hjalmar]] to a draw, entered into foster-brotherhood with him {{Dubious span|by this turf-raising ritual. Afterwards, the strand of turf was put back during oaths and incantations.|date=May 2018}}{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} 

In the mythology of northern Europe, [[Gunther]] and [[Högni]] became the blood brothers of [[Sigurd]] when he married their sister [[Gudrun]]; in [[Wagner]]'s ''[[Ring Cycle]]'', the same occurs between [[Gunther]] and Wagner's version of Sigurd, [[Siegfried (opera)|Siegfried]], which is marked by the "Blood Brotherhood [[Leitmotiv]]". Additionally, it is briefly stated in [[Lokasenna]] that [[Odin]] and [[Loki]] are blood brothers.

===Scythia===
Among the [[Scyth]]ians, the covenantors would allow their blood to drip into a cup; the blood was subsequently mixed with wine and drunk by both participants. Every man was limited to having at most three blood brotherhoods at any time, lest his loyalties be distrusted; as a consequence, blood brotherhood was highly sought after and often preceded by a lengthy period of affiliation and friendship ([[Lucian]], ''[[Toxaris]]''). 
4th-century BC depictions of two Scythian warriors drinking from a single [[drinking horn]] (most notably in a gold appliqué from [[Kul-Oba]]) have been associated with the Scythian oath of blood brotherhood.&lt;ref&gt;Caspar Meyer, ''Greco-Scythian Art and the Birth of Eurasia: From Classical Antiquity to Russian Modernity'',  OUP (2013), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=884TAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA246#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 246 (fig. 98b)] "Gold relief appliqué showing two Scythians drinking from one drinking horn. From [[Kul-Oba]] (Inventory 2, K.12h). Rostoftzeff identified the scene with the Scythain sacred oath described in Herodotus 4.70. Fourth century BC. 5 × 3.7 cm, 28.35 gr."; see also

The Hungarian [[hajduk]]s had a similar ceremony, though the wine was often replaced with milk so that the blood would be more visible.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

===Asia===
In [[Culture of Asia|Asian cultures]], the act and ceremony of becoming blood brothers is generally seen as a [[tribal]] relationship, that is, to bring about alliance between tribes. It was practiced for this reason most notably among the [[Mongol]]s and [[Chinese history|early Chinese]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

In [[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]'','' the Chinese classical literature, the three main characters took an oath of blood brother.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Oath of the Peach Garden|date=2018-07-28|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Oath_of_the_Peach_Garden&amp;oldid=852357830|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Mongolian history, Genghis Khan the Great had an anda, blood brother in Mongolian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/anda|title=Anda {{!}} oath|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Africa===
The blood oath was used in much the same fashion as has already been described in much of 
[[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. The British colonial administrator [[Lord Lugard]] is famous for having become blood brothers with numerous African chiefs as part of his political policy while in Africa. A powerful blood brother of his was the 
[[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]] chieftain [[Waiyaki Wa Hinga]].

===Americas===
There may be some evidence that [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] performed blood oathes to bring about [[Political alliance|alliances]] between tribes.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

===Southeastern Europe===
Blood brothers among larger groups were common in ancient [[Southeastern Europe]] where, for example, whole companies of soldiers would become one family through the ceremony. It was perhaps most prevalent in the [[Balkans]] during the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] era, as it helped the oppressed people to fight the enemy more effectively; blood brotherhoods were common in what is today [[Albania]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Croatia]], [[Greece]], [[Montenegro]], [[Serbia]], [[Republic of Macedonia]]. Christianity also recognized sworn brotherhood in a ceremony (known as {{lang-gr|[[adelphopoiesis]]}}, {{lang-sla|pobratimstvo}} in the [[Eastern Orthodox]] churches; known as {{lang-la|ordo ad fratres faciendum}} in the [[Roman Catholic]] church). The tradition of intertwining arms and drinking wine is also believed to be a representation of becoming blood brothers.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

===Caucasus===
Blood brotherhood, highly ritualized and subjected to a strong code, was a common practice in the [[Caucasus]], especially among the mountaineers. Some relics of this tradition survive to this day.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

* [[Samoans|Samoan]] [[professional wrestler]] [[Peter Maivia|"High Chief" Peter Maivia]] was considered a blood brother of Amituanai Anoa'i, the father of the fellow professional wrestlers [[Afa Anoaʻi|Afa]] and [[Sika Anoaʻi|Sika Anoa'i]], who are better known as [[the Wild Samoans]], thus the Anoa'i family regard the Maivia line from him on forward as an extension of their own clan.

=== Folklore and popular culture ===
* The Norse gods [[Loki]] and [[Odin]] are famously stated to have mixed blood in ''days of old'' in ''Lokasenna''. This has been taken as an explanation why Loki is at all tolerated by the gods. 
* [[Liu Bei]], [[Guan Yu]] and [[Zhang Fei (Three Kingdoms)|Zhang Fei]]. In the historical novel ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]'' by [[Luo Guanzhong]], these three men swore in their famous [[Oath of the Peach Garden]] that despite not being born on the same day, their sworn brotherhood would end with them dying on the same day. Histories only mention that the three men were "close like brothers".
* In the Chinese tale ''[[Journey to the West]]'', [[Sun Wukong]] (the Monkey King) became blood brothers with [[List of Journey to the West characters#Bull Demon King, Princess Iron Fan and associates|Niu Mowang]] (the Bull Demon King), but later on this brother relationship was forgotten because of a conflict that occurred involving the bull demon's son that caused other problems for Wukong.

'''Chaos theory''' is a branch of [[mathematics]] focusing on the behavior of [[dynamical system]]s that are highly sensitive to [[initial conditions]]. "Chaos" is an interdisciplinary theory stating that within the apparent randomness of [[chaotic complex system]]s, there are underlying patterns, constant [[feedback loops]], repetition, [[self-similarity]], [[fractals]], [[self-organization]], and reliance on programming at the initial point known as ''sensitive dependence on initial conditions''. The [[butterfly effect]] describes how a small change in one state of a deterministic nonlinear system can result in large differences in a later state, e.g. a butterfly flapping its wings in Brazil can cause a hurricane in Texas.&lt;ref name="bo1"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://geoffboeing.com/2015/03/chaos-theory-logistic-map/ |author = Boeing |title = Chaos Theory and the Logistic Map |date = 2015 |accessdate = 2015-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Small differences in initial conditions, such as those due to rounding errors in numerical computation, yield widely diverging outcomes for such dynamical systems, rendering long-term prediction of their behavior impossible in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Kellert |first = Stephen H. |title = In the Wake of Chaos: Unpredictable Order in Dynamical Systems |publisher = University of Chicago Press |year = 1993 |isbn = 978-0-226-42976-2 |page = 32 |ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Boeing2016Systems"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://geoffboeing.com/publications/nonlinear-chaos-fractals-prediction/|author=Boeing, G.|title=Visual Analysis of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems: Chaos, Fractals, Self-Similarity and the Limits of Prediction|journal=Systems|date=2016|volume=4|issue=4|pages=37|accessdate=2016-12-02|doi=10.3390/systems4040037}}&lt;/ref&gt; This happens even though these systems are [[deterministic system (mathematics)|deterministic]], meaning that their future behavior is fully determined by their initial conditions, with no [[randomness|random]] elements involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kellert|1993|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the deterministic nature of these systems does not make them predictable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kellert|1993|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WerndlCharlotte"&gt;{{cite journal |author = Werndl, Charlotte |title = What are the New Implications of Chaos for Unpredictability? |journal = The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science |volume = 60 |issue = 1 |pages = 195–220 |year = 2009 |url = http://bjps.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/60/1/195 |doi = 10.1093/bjps/axn053 |arxiv = 1310.1576 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This behavior is known as '''deterministic chaos''', or simply '''chaos'''.

==Introduction==
Chaos theory concerns deterministic systems whose behavior can in principle be predicted. Chaotic systems are predictable for a while and then 'appear' to become random.&lt;ref name="Boeing2016Systems" /&gt; The amount of time that the behavior of a chaotic system can be effectively predicted depends on three things: How much uncertainty can be tolerated in the forecast, how accurately its current state can be measured, and a time scale depending on the dynamics of the system, called the [[Lyapunov time]]. Some examples of Lyapunov times are: chaotic electrical circuits, about 1 millisecond; weather systems, a few  days (unproven); the solar system, 50 million years. In chaotic systems, the uncertainty in a forecast increases [[Exponential growth|exponentially]] with elapsed time. Hence, mathematically, doubling the forecast time more than squares the proportional uncertainty in the forecast. This means, in practice, a meaningful prediction cannot be made over an interval of more than two or three times the Lyapunov time. When meaningful predictions cannot be made, the system appears random.&lt;ref&gt;''Sync: The Emerging Science of Spontaneous Order'', Steven Strogatz, Hyperion, New York, 2003, pages 189–190.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chaotic dynamics==

Here, two series of ''x'' and ''y'' values diverge markedly over time from a tiny initial difference.]]
In common usage, "chaos" means "a state of disorder".&lt;ref&gt;Definition of {{linktext|chaos}} at [[Wiktionary]];&lt;/ref&gt; However, in chaos theory, the term is defined more precisely. Although no universally accepted mathematical definition of chaos exists, a commonly used definition originally formulated by [[Robert L. Devaney]] says that, to classify a dynamical system as chaotic, it must have these properties:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A First Course in Dynamics: With a Panorama of Recent Developments|last=Hasselblatt|first=Boris|author2=Anatole Katok|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-58750-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# it must be sensitive to initial conditions
# it must be [[topological mixing|topologically mixing]]
# it must have [[dense set|dense]] [[periodic orbit]]s

In some cases, the last two properties in the above have been shown to actually imply sensitivity to initial conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Elaydi, Saber N. |title=Discrete Chaos |publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall/CRC |year=1999 |isbn=978-1-58488-002-8 |page=117 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Basener, William F. |title=Topology and its applications |publisher=Wiley |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-471-68755-9 |page=42 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cases, while it is often the most practically significant property, "sensitivity to initial conditions" need not be stated in the definition.

If attention is restricted to [[Interval (mathematics)|intervals]], the second property implies the other two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Vellekoop, Michel |author2=Berglund, Raoul |title=On Intervals, Transitivity = Chaos |journal=The American Mathematical Monthly |volume=101 |issue=4 |pages=353–5 |date=April 1994 |jstor=2975629 |doi=10.2307/2975629}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative, and in general weaker, definition of chaos uses only the first two properties in the above list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Medio, Alfredo |author2=Lines, Marji |title=Nonlinear Dynamics: A Primer |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-521-55874-7 |page=165 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chaos as a spontaneous breakdown of topological supersymmetry ===
{{Main|Supersymmetric theory of stochastic dynamics}}In continuous time dynamical systems, chaos is the phenomenon of the spontaneous breakdown of topological supersymmetry which is an intrinsic property of evolution operators of all stochastic and deterministic (partial) differential equations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=March 2016|title=Introduction to Supersymmetric Theory of Stochastics|journal=Entropy|volume=18|issue=4|pages=108|doi=10.3390/e18040108|author=Ovchinnikov, I.V.|arxiv = 1511.03393 |bibcode = 2016Entrp..18..108O }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2016|title=Topological supersymmetry breaking: Definition and stochastic generalization of chaos and the limit of applicability of statistics|journal=Modern Physics Letters B|volume=30|issue=8|pages=1650086|doi=10.1142/S021798491650086X|author1=Ovchinnikov, I.V.|author2=Schwartz, R. N.|author3=Wang, K. L.|bibcode = 2016MPLB...3050086O |arxiv=1404.4076}}&lt;/ref&gt; This picture of dynamical chaos works not only for deterministic models but also for models with external noise, which is an important generalization from the physical point of view because in reality all dynamical systems experience influence from their stochastic environments. Within this picture, the long-range dynamical behavior associated with chaotic dynamics, e.g., the [[butterfly effect]], is a consequence of the [[Goldstone's theorem]] in the application to the spontaneous topological supersymmetry breaking.

===Sensitivity to initial conditions===
{{Main|Butterfly effect}}
[[File:SensInitCond.gif|thumb|Lorenz equations used to generate plots for the y variable. The initial conditions for ''x'' and ''z'' were kept the same but those for ''y'' were changed between '''1.001''', '''1.0001''' and '''1.00001'''. The values for &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; were '''45.92''', '''16''' and '''4 ''' respectively. As can be seen, even the slightest difference in initial values causes significant changes after about 12 seconds of evolution in the three cases. This is an example of sensitive dependence on initial conditions.]]
'''Sensitivity to initial conditions''' means that each point in a chaotic system is arbitrarily closely approximated by other points with significantly different future paths, or trajectories. Thus, an arbitrarily small change, or perturbation, of the current trajectory may lead to significantly different future behavior.

Sensitivity to initial conditions is popularly known as the "[[butterfly effect]]", so-called because of the title of a paper given by [[Edward Lorenz]] in 1972 to the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] in Washington, D.C., entitled ''Predictability: Does the Flap of a Butterfly's Wings in Brazil set off a Tornado in Texas?''. The flapping wing represents a small change in the initial condition of the system, which causes a chain of events that prevents the predictability of large-scale phenomena. Had the butterfly not flapped its wings, the trajectory of the overall system would have been vastly different.

A consequence of sensitivity to initial conditions is that if we start with a limited amount of information about the system (as is usually the case in practice), then beyond a certain time the system is no longer predictable. This is most prevalent in the case of weather, which is generally predictable only about a week ahead.&lt;ref name="RGW"&gt;{{cite book |author=Watts, Robert G. |title=Global Warming and the Future of the Earth |publisher=Morgan &amp; Claypool |year=2007 |page=17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of course, this does not mean that we cannot say anything about events far in the future; some restrictions on the system are present. With weather, we know that the temperature will not naturally reach 100&amp;nbsp;°C or fall to −130&amp;nbsp;°C on earth (during the current [[geologic era]]), but we can't say exactly what day will have the hottest temperature of the year.

In more mathematical terms, the [[Lyapunov exponent]] measures the sensitivity to initial conditions. Given two starting [[trajectory|trajectories]] in the [[phase space]] that are infinitesimally close, with initial separation &lt;math&gt;\delta \mathbf{Z}_0&lt;/math&gt;, the two trajectories end up diverging at a rate given by

:&lt;math&gt; | \delta\mathbf{Z}(t) | \approx e^{\lambda t} | \delta \mathbf{Z}_0 |,&lt;/math&gt;

where t is the time and λ is the Lyapunov exponent. The rate of separation depends on the orientation of the initial separation vector, so a whole spectrum of Lyapunov exponents exist. The number of Lyapunov exponents is equal to the number of dimensions of the phase space, though it is common to just refer to the largest one. For example, the maximal Lyapunov exponent (MLE) is most often used because it determines the overall predictability of the system. A positive MLE is usually taken as an indication that the system is chaotic.

Also, other properties relate to sensitivity of initial conditions, such as [[Measure (mathematics)|measure-theoretical]] [[Mixing (mathematics)|mixing]] (as discussed in [[ergodicity|ergodic]] theory) and properties of a [[Kolmogorov automorphism|K-system]].&lt;ref name="WerndlCharlotte" /&gt;

===Topological mixing===
[[File:LogisticTopMixing1-6.gif|thumb|Six iterations of a set of states &lt;math&gt;[x,y]&lt;/math&gt;  passed through the logistic map. (a) the blue plot (legend 1) shows the first iterate (initial condition), which essentially forms a circle. Animation shows the first to the sixth iteration of the circular initial conditions. It can be seen that ''mixing'' occurs as we progress in iterations. The sixth iteration shows that the points are almost completely scattered in the phase space. Had we progressed further in iterations, the mixing would have been homogeneous and irreversible. The logistic map has equation &lt;math&gt;x_{k+1} = 4  x_k  (1 - x_k )&lt;/math&gt;. To expand the state-space of the logistic map into two dimensions,  a second state, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, was created as &lt;math&gt;y_{k+1} = x_k + y_k &lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;x_k + y_k &lt;1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y_{k+1} = x_k + y_k -1&lt;/math&gt; otherwise.]]
[[File:Chaos Topological Mixing.png|thumb|The map defined by &lt;span style="white-space: nowrap;"&gt;''x'' → 4 ''x'' (1 – ''x'')&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="white-space: nowrap;"&gt;''y'' → (''x'' + ''y)'' [[Modulo operation|mod]] 1&lt;/span&gt; also displays [[topological mixing]]. Here, the blue region is transformed by the dynamics first to the purple region, then to the pink and red regions, and eventually to a cloud of vertical lines scattered across the space.]]

'''[[Topological mixing]]''' (or '''topological transitivity''') means that the system evolves over time so that any given region or [[open set]] of its [[phase space]] eventually overlaps with any other given region. This mathematical concept of "mixing" corresponds to the standard intuition, and the mixing of colored [[dye]]s or fluids is an example of a chaotic system.

Topological mixing is often omitted from popular accounts of chaos, which equate chaos with only sensitivity to initial conditions. However, sensitive dependence on initial conditions alone does not give chaos. For example, consider the simple dynamical system produced by repeatedly doubling an initial value. This system has sensitive dependence on initial conditions everywhere, since any pair of nearby points eventually becomes widely separated. However, this example has no topological mixing, and therefore has no chaos. Indeed, it has extremely simple behavior: all points except 0 tend to positive or negative infinity.

===Density of periodic orbits===
For a chaotic system to have [[Dense set|dense]] [[periodic orbits]] means that every point in the space is approached arbitrarily closely by periodic orbits.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Devaney|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The one-dimensional [[logistic map]] defined by &lt;span style="white-space: nowrap;"&gt;''x'' → 4 ''x'' (1 – ''x'')&lt;/span&gt; is one of the simplest systems with density of periodic orbits.  For example, &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{5-\sqrt{5}}{8}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;→ &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{5+\sqrt{5}}{8}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;→ &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{5-\sqrt{5}}{8}&lt;/math&gt; (or approximately 0.3454915&amp;nbsp;→ 0.9045085&amp;nbsp;→ 0.3454915) is an (unstable) orbit of period 2, and similar orbits exist for periods 4, 8, 16, etc. (indeed, for all the periods specified by [[Sharkovskii's theorem]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Alligood|Sauer|Yorke|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sharkovskii's theorem is the basis of the Li and Yorke&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Li |first1=T.Y. |last2=Yorke |first2=J.A. |title=Period Three Implies Chaos |journal=[[American Mathematical Monthly]] |volume=82 |pages=985–92 |year=1975 |url=http://pb.math.univ.gda.pl/chaos/pdf/li-yorke.pdf |format=PDF |author-link=Tien-Yien Li |doi=10.2307/2318254 |issue=10 |author2-link=James A.

===Strange attractors===
[[File:TwoLorenzOrbits.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Lorenz attractor]] displays chaotic behavior.  These two plots demonstrate sensitive dependence on initial conditions within the region of phase space occupied by the attractor.]]
Some dynamical systems, like the one-dimensional [[logistic map]] defined by &lt;span style="white-space: nowrap;"&gt;''x'' → 4 ''x'' (1 – ''x''),&lt;/span&gt; are chaotic everywhere, but in many cases chaotic behavior is found only in a subset of phase space. The cases of most interest arise when the chaotic behavior takes place on an [[attractor]], since then a large set of initial conditions leads to orbits that converge to this chaotic region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Strelioff|first1=Christopher|last2=et.|first2=al.|title=Medium-Term Prediction of Chaos|journal=Phys. Rev. Lett.|date=2006|volume=96|issue=4|pages=044101|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.96.044101|pmid=16486826|bibcode = 2006PhRvL..96d4101S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An easy way to visualize a chaotic attractor is to start with a point in the [[basin of attraction]] of the attractor, and then simply plot its subsequent orbit. Because of the topological transitivity condition, this is likely to produce a picture of the entire final attractor, and indeed both orbits shown in the figure on the right give a picture of the general shape of the Lorenz attractor.  This attractor results from a simple three-dimensional model of the [[Edward Lorenz|Lorenz]] weather system. The Lorenz attractor is perhaps one of the best-known chaotic system diagrams, probably because it was not only one of the first, but it is also one of the most complex and as such gives rise to a very interesting pattern that, with a little imagination, looks like the wings of a butterfly.

Unlike [[Attractor#Fixed point|fixed-point attractors]] and [[limit cycle]]s, the attractors that arise from chaotic systems, known as [[strange attractor]]s, have great detail and complexity.  Strange attractors occur in both [[continuous function|continuous]] dynamical systems (such as the Lorenz system) and in some [[discrete mathematics|discrete]] systems (such as the [[Hénon map]]). Other discrete dynamical systems have a repelling structure called a [[Julia set]], which forms at the boundary between basins of attraction of fixed points. Julia sets can be thought of as strange repellers. Both strange attractors and Julia sets typically have a [[fractal]] structure, and the [[fractal dimension]] can be calculated for them.

===Minimum complexity of a chaotic system===
[[File:LogisticMap BifurcationDiagram.png|thumb|right|[[Bifurcation diagram]] of the [[logistic map]] &lt;span style="white-space: nowrap;"&gt;''x'' → ''r'' ''x'' (1 – ''x'').&lt;/span&gt;  Each vertical slice shows the attractor for a specific value of ''r''.  The diagram displays [[Period-doubling bifurcation|period-doubling]] as ''r'' increases, eventually producing chaos.]]

Discrete chaotic systems, such as the logistic map, can exhibit strange attractors whatever their [[dimension]]ality. In contrast, for [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] dynamical systems, the [[Poincaré–Bendixson theorem]] shows that a strange attractor can only arise in three or more dimensions.  [[Dimension (vector space)|Finite-dimensional]] [[linear system]]s are never chaotic; for a dynamical system to display chaotic behavior, it must be either [[nonlinearity|nonlinear]] or infinite-dimensional.

The [[Poincaré–Bendixson theorem]] states that a two-dimensional differential equation has very regular behavior. The Lorenz attractor discussed below is generated by a system of three [[differential equation]]s such as:
: &lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
\frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}t} &amp;= \sigma y - \sigma x, \\
\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}t} &amp;= \rho x - x z - y, \\
\frac{\mathrm{d}z}{\mathrm{d}t} &amp;= x y - \beta z.
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; make up the [[State space representation|system state]], &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is time, and &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; are the system [[parameter]]s. Five of the terms on the right hand side are linear, while two are quadratic; a total of seven terms. Another well-known chaotic attractor is generated by the [[Rössler map|Rössler equations]], which have only one nonlinear term out of seven. Sprott&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sprott |first=J.C.|year=1997|title=Simplest dissipative chaotic flow|journal=[[Physics Letters A]]|volume=228|issue=4–5 |pages=271–274|doi=10.1016/S0375-9601(97)00088-1|bibcode = 1997PhLA..228..271S }}&lt;/ref&gt; found a three-dimensional system with just five terms, that had only one nonlinear term, which exhibits chaos for certain parameter values.

The reason is, simply put, that solutions to such systems are asymptotic to a two-dimensional surface and therefore solutions are well behaved.

While the Poincaré–Bendixson theorem shows that a continuous dynamical system on the Euclidean [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] cannot be chaotic, two-dimensional continuous systems with [[non-Euclidean geometry]] can exhibit chaotic behavior.&lt;ref name="Rosario 2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosario|first=Pedro|title=Underdetermination of Science: Part I|date=2006|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=978-1411693913}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Perhaps surprisingly, chaos may occur also in linear systems, provided they are infinite dimensional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A theory of linear chaos is being developed in a branch of mathematical analysis known as [[functional analysis]].

=== Jerk systems ===
In [[physics]], [[Jerk (physics)|jerk]] is the third derivative of [[position (vector)|position]], with respect to time.  As such, differential equations of the form
:: &lt;math&gt;J\left(\overset{...}{x},\ddot{x},\dot {x},x\right)=0&lt;/math&gt;
are sometimes called ''Jerk equations''. It has been shown that a jerk equation, which is equivalent to a system of three first order, ordinary, non-linear differential equations, is in a certain sense the minimal setting for solutions showing chaotic behaviour. This motivates mathematical interest in jerk systems. Systems involving a fourth or higher derivative are called accordingly hyperjerk systems.&lt;ref&gt;K. E. Chlouverakis and J. C. Sprott, Chaos Solitons &amp; Fractals 28, 739–746 (2005), Chaotic Hyperjerk Systems, http://sprott.physics.wisc.edu/pubs/paper297.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

A jerk system's behavior is described by a jerk equation, and for certain jerk equations, simple electronic circuits can model solutions. These circuits are known as jerk circuits.

One of the most interesting properties of jerk circuits is the possibility of chaotic behavior. In fact, certain well-known chaotic systems, such as the Lorenz attractor and the [[Rössler map]], are conventionally described as a system of three first-order differential equations that can combine into a single (although rather complicated) jerk equation. Nonlinear jerk systems are in a sense minimally complex systems to show chaotic behaviour; there is no chaotic system involving only two first-order, ordinary differential equations (the system resulting in an equation of second order only).

An example of a jerk equation with nonlinearity in the magnitude of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d}^3 x}{\mathrm{d} t^3}+A\frac{\mathrm{d}^2 x}{\mathrm{d} t^2}+\frac{\mathrm{d} x}{\mathrm{d} t}-|x|+1=0.&lt;/math&gt;

Here, ''A'' is an adjustable parameter. This equation has a chaotic solution for ''A''=3/5 and can be implemented with the following jerk circuit; the required nonlinearity is brought about by the two diodes:

[[File:JerkCircuit01.png|frameless|upright=1.4|center]]

In the above circuit, all resistors are of equal value, except &lt;math&gt;R_A=R/A=5R/3&lt;/math&gt;, and all capacitors are of equal size. The dominant frequency is &lt;math&gt;1/2\pi R C&lt;/math&gt;. The output of [[operational amplifier|op amp]] 0 will correspond to the x variable, the output of 1 corresponds to the first derivative of x and the output of 2 corresponds to the second derivative.

==Spontaneous order==
Under the right conditions, chaos spontaneously evolves into a lockstep pattern. In the [[Kuramoto model]], four conditions suffice to produce synchronization in a chaotic system.
Examples include the [[coupled oscillation]] of [[Christiaan Huygens]]' pendulums, fireflies, [[neuron]]s, the [[London Millennium Bridge]] resonance, and large arrays of [[Josephson junctions]].&lt;ref&gt;Steven Strogatz, ''Sync: The Emerging Science of Spontaneous Order'', Hyperion, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

An early proponent of chaos theory was [[Henri Poincaré]]. In the 1880s, while studying the [[three-body problem]], he found that there can be orbits that are nonperiodic, and yet not forever increasing nor approaching a fixed point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Poincaré, Jules Henri |title=Sur le problème des trois corps et les équations de la dynamique.

Chaos theory began in the field of [[ergodic theory]]. Later studies, also on the topic of nonlinear [[differential equations]], were carried out by [[George David Birkhoff]],&lt;ref&gt;George D.

Despite initial insights in the first half of the twentieth century, chaos theory became formalized as such only after mid-century, when it first became evident to some scientists that [[linear theory]], the prevailing system theory at that time, simply could not explain the observed behavior of certain experiments like that of the [[logistic map]]. What had been attributed to measure imprecision and simple "[[Pseudorandom noise|noise]]" was considered by chaos theorists as a full component of the studied systems.

The main catalyst for the development of chaos theory was the electronic computer. Much of the mathematics of chaos theory involves the repeated [[iteration]] of simple mathematical formulas, which would be impractical to do by hand. Electronic computers made these repeated calculations practical, while figures and images made it possible to visualize these systems. As a graduate student in [[Chihiro Hayashi]]'s laboratory at Kyoto University, [[Yoshisuke Ueda]] was experimenting with analog computers and noticed, on November 27, 1961, what he called "randomly transitional phenomena".  Yet his advisor did not agree with his conclusions at the time, and did not allow him to report his findings until 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abraham|Ueda|2001|loc=See Chapters 3 and 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sprott|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=SEDjdjPZ158C&amp;pg=PA89 89]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Airplane vortex edit.jpg|thumb|left|[[Turbulence]] in the [[Wingtip vortices|tip vortex]] from an [[airplane]] wing. Studies of the critical point beyond which a system creates turbulence were important for chaos theory, analyzed for example by the [[Soviet physicists|Soviet physicist]] [[Lev Landau]], who developed the [[Landau-Hopf theory of turbulence]]. [[David Ruelle]] and [[Floris Takens]] later predicted, against Landau, that [[fluid turbulence]] could develop through a [[strange attractor]], a main concept of chaos theory.]]

[[Edward Lorenz]] was an early pioneer of the theory. His interest in chaos came about accidentally through his work on [[meteorology|weather prediction]] in 1961.&lt;ref name=Lorenz1961&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lorenz, Edward N. |title=Deterministic non-periodic flow |journal=Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences |volume=20 |pages=130–141 |year=1963 |doi=10.1175/1520-0469(1963)020&lt;0130:DNF&gt;2.0.CO;2 |issue=2 |bibcode=1963JAtS...20..130L}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lorenz was using a simple digital computer, a [[Royal McBee]] [[LGP-30]], to run his weather simulation. He wanted to see a sequence of data again, and to save time he started the simulation in the middle of its course. He did this by entering a printout of the data that corresponded to conditions in the middle of the original simulation. To his surprise, the weather the machine began to predict was completely different from the previous calculation. Lorenz tracked this down to the computer printout. The computer worked with 6-digit precision, but the printout rounded variables off to a 3-digit number, so a value like 0.506127 printed as 0.506. This difference is tiny, and the consensus at the time would have been that it should have no practical effect. However, Lorenz discovered that small changes in initial conditions produced large changes in long-term outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Chaos: Making a New Science]] |last=Gleick |first=James |year=1987 |publisher=Cardinal |location=London|page=17|isbn=978-0-434-29554-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lorenz's discovery, which gave its name to [[Lorenz attractor]]s, showed that even detailed atmospheric modelling cannot, in general, make precise long-term weather predictions.

In 1963, [[Benoit Mandelbrot]] found recurring patterns at every scale in data on cotton prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first = Benoît|last = Mandelbrot|year = 1963|title = The variation of certain speculative prices|journal = Journal of Business|volume = 36|pages = 394–419|doi = 10.1086/294632|issue = 4|jstor=2350970}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beforehand he had studied [[information theory]] and concluded noise was patterned like a [[Cantor set]]: on any scale the proportion of noise-containing periods to error-free periods was a constant – thus errors were inevitable and must be planned for by incorporating redundancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Berger J.M. |author2=Mandelbrot B. | year = 1963 | title = A new model for error clustering in telephone circuits | journal = IBM Journal of Research and Development | volume = 7 |issue=3 | pages = 224–236 | doi=10.1147/rd.73.0224}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mandelbrot described both the "Noah effect" (in which sudden discontinuous changes can occur) and the "Joseph effect" (in which persistence of a value can occur for a while, yet suddenly change afterwards).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Mandelbrot, B. |title=The Fractal Geometry of Nature |publisher=Freeman |location=New York |year=1977 |page=248 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also: {{cite book |last1=Mandelbrot |first1=Benoît B. |last2=Hudson |first2=Richard L. |title=The (Mis)behavior of Markets: A Fractal View of Risk, Ruin, and Reward |publisher=Basic Books |location=New York |year=2004 |page=201 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This challenged the idea that changes in price were [[normal distribution|normally distributed]]. In 1967, he published "[[How Long Is the Coast of Britain? Statistical Self-Similarity and Fractional Dimension|How long is the coast of Britain? Statistical self-similarity and fractional dimension]]", showing that a coastline's length varies with the scale of the measuring instrument, resembles itself at all scales, and is infinite in length for an [[infinitesimal]]ly small measuring device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mandelbrot |first=Benoît |title=How Long Is the Coast of Britain?

An object whose irregularity is constant over different scales ("self-similarity") is a [[fractal]] (examples include the [[Menger sponge]], the [[Sierpiński gasket]], and the [[Koch curve]] or ''snowflake'', which is infinitely long yet encloses a finite space and has a [[fractal dimension]] of circa 1.2619). In 1982, Mandelbrot published ''[[The Fractal Geometry of Nature]]'', which became a classic of chaos theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mandelbrot, B.|title=The Fractal Geometry of Nature|date=1982|place=New York|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-0716711865}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biological systems such as the branching of the circulatory and bronchial systems proved to fit a fractal model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Buldyrev |first1=S.V. |last2=Goldberger |first2=A.L. | last3=Havlin |first3=S. | authorlink3=Shlomo Havlin|last4=Peng |first4=C.K. | last5=Stanley | first5=H.E. |authorlink5=H.

In December 1977, the [[New York Academy of Sciences]] organized the first symposium on chaos, attended by David Ruelle, [[Robert May, Baron May of Oxford|Robert May]], [[James A. Yorke]] (coiner of the term "chaos" as used in mathematics), [[Robert Shaw (physicist)|Robert Shaw]], and the meteorologist Edward Lorenz. The following year, independently [[Pierre Coullet]] and [[Charles Tresser]] with the article "Iterations d'endomorphismes et groupe de renormalisation" and [[Mitchell Feigenbaum]] with the article "Quantitative Universality for a Class of Nonlinear Transformations" described logistic maps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Mitchell |last=Feigenbaum |title=Quantitative universality for a class of nonlinear transformations |journal=Journal of Statistical Physics |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=25–52 |date=July 1978 |doi=10.1007/BF01020332 |bibcode=1978JSP....19...25F}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coullet, Pierre, and Charles Tresser. "Iterations d'endomorphismes et groupe de renormalisation." Le Journal de Physique Colloques 39.C5 (1978): C5-25&lt;/ref&gt;  They notably discovered the [[Universality (dynamical systems)|universality]] in chaos, permitting the application of chaos theory to many different phenomena.

In 1979, [[Albert J. Libchaber]], during a symposium organized in Aspen by [[Pierre Hohenberg]], presented his experimental observation of the [[Bifurcation theory|bifurcation]] cascade that leads to chaos and turbulence in [[Rayleigh–Bénard convection]] systems. He was awarded the [[Wolf Prize in Physics]] in 1986 along with [[Mitchell J. Feigenbaum]] for their inspiring achievements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.wolffund.org.il/cat.asp?id=25&amp;cat_title=PHYSICS|title = The Wolf Prize in Physics in 1986.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, the New York Academy of Sciences co-organized with the [[National Institute of Mental Health]] and the [[Office of Naval Research]] the first important conference on chaos in biology and medicine. There, [[Bernardo Huberman]] presented a mathematical model of the [[eye tracking disorder]] among [[schizophrenics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=Bernardo Huberman |author=Huberman, B.A. |title=A Model for Dysfunctions in Smooth Pursuit Eye Movement |journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences |volume=504 Perspectives in Biological Dynamics and Theoretical Medicine |pages=260–273 |date=July 1987 |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1987.tb48737.x |bibcode = 1987NYASA.504..260H }}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to a renewal of [[physiology]] in the 1980s through the application of chaos theory, for example, in the study of pathological [[cardiac cycle]]s.

In 1987, [[Per Bak]], [[Chao Tang]] and [[Kurt Wiesenfeld]] published a paper in ''[[Physical Review Letters]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bak, Per; Tang, Chao; Wiesenfeld, Kurt |title=Self-organized criticality: An explanation of the 1/f noise |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=59 |issue=4 |pages=381–4 |date=27 July 1987 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.59.381 |bibcode=1987PhRvL..59..381B|last2=Tang |last3=Wiesenfeld }} However, the conclusions of this article have been subject to dispute. {{cite web|url=http://www.nslij-genetics.org/wli/1fnoise/1fnoise_square.html |title=? |work= |publisher= |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214033929/https://www.nslij-genetics.org/wli/1fnoise/1fnoise_square.html |archivedate=2007-12-14 |df= }}. See especially: {{cite journal |author1=Laurson, Lasse |author2=Alava, Mikko J. |author3=Zapperi, Stefano |title=Letter: Power spectra of self-organized critical sand piles |journal=Journal of Statistical Mechanics: Theory and Experiment |volume=0511 |id=L001 |date=15 September 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; describing for the first time [[self-organized criticality]] (SOC), considered one of the mechanisms by which [[complexity]] arises in nature.

Alongside largely lab-based approaches such as the [[Bak–Tang–Wiesenfeld sandpile]], many other investigations have focused on large-scale natural or social systems that are known (or suspected) to display [[scale invariance|scale-invariant]] behavior. Although these approaches were not always welcomed (at least initially) by specialists in the subjects examined, SOC has nevertheless become established as a strong candidate for explaining a number of natural phenomena, including [[earthquake]]s, (which, long before SOC was discovered, were known as a source of scale-invariant behavior such as the [[Gutenberg–Richter law]] describing the statistical distribution of earthquake sizes, and the [[Aftershock|Omori law]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Omori, F. |title=On the aftershocks of earthquakes |journal=Journal of the College of Science, Imperial University of Tokyo |volume=7 |pages=111–200 |year=1894 }}&lt;/ref&gt; describing the frequency of aftershocks), [[solar flare]]s, fluctuations in economic systems such as [[financial market]]s (references to SOC are common in [[econophysics]]), [[landscape formation]], [[forest fire]]s, [[landslide]]s, [[epidemic]]s, and [[biological evolution]] (where SOC has been invoked, for example, as the dynamical mechanism behind the theory of "[[punctuated equilibrium|punctuated equilibria]]" put forward by [[Niles Eldredge]] and [[Stephen Jay Gould]]). Given the implications of a scale-free distribution of event sizes, some researchers have suggested that another phenomenon that should be considered an example of SOC is the occurrence of [[war]]s. These investigations of SOC have included both attempts at modelling (either developing new models or adapting existing ones to the specifics of a given natural system), and extensive data analysis to determine the existence and/or characteristics of natural scaling laws.

In the same year, [[James Gleick]] published ''[[Chaos: Making a New Science]]'', which became a best-seller and introduced the general principles of chaos theory as well as its history to the broad public, though his history under-emphasized important Soviet contributions.{{citation needed|reason=No reason given for soviet under-emphasis|date=May 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gleick|first=James|title=Chaos: Making a New Science|date=August 26, 2008|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=978-0143113454}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially the domain of a few, isolated individuals, chaos theory progressively emerged as a transdisciplinary and institutional discipline, mainly under the name of [[nonlinear system]]s analysis. Alluding to [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s concept of a [[paradigm shift]] exposed in ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' (1962), many "chaologists" (as some described themselves) claimed that this new theory was an example of such a shift, a thesis upheld by Gleick.

The availability of cheaper, more powerful computers broadens the applicability of chaos theory.

Chaos theory has been used for many years in [[cryptography]]. In the past few decades, chaos and nonlinear dynamics have been used in the design of hundreds of [[cryptographic primitive]]s. These algorithms include image [[encryption algorithms]], [[hash functions]], [[Cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator|secure pseudo-random number generators]], [[stream ciphers]], [[Digital watermarking|watermarking]] and [[steganography]].&lt;ref name="Akhavan 1797–1813"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Akhavan|first=A.|last2=Samsudin|first2=A.|last3=Akhshani|first3=A.|date=2011-10-01|title=A symmetric image encryption scheme based on combination of nonlinear chaotic maps|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016003211001104|journal=Journal of the Franklin Institute|volume=348|issue=8|pages=1797–1813|doi=10.1016/j.jfranklin.2011.05.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of these algorithms are based on uni-modal chaotic maps and a big portion of these algorithms use the control parameters and the initial condition of the chaotic maps as their keys.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Behnia|first=S.|last2=Akhshani|first2=A.|last3=Mahmodi|first3=H.|last4=Akhavan|first4=A.|date=2008-01-01|title=A novel algorithm for image encryption based on mixture of chaotic maps|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960077906004681|journal=Chaos, Solitons &amp; Fractals|volume=35|issue=2|pages=408–419|doi=10.1016/j.chaos.2006.05.011|bibcode = 2008CSF....35..408B }}&lt;/ref&gt; From a wider perspective, without loss of generality, the similarities between the chaotic maps and the cryptographic systems is the main motivation for the design of chaos based cryptographic algorithms.&lt;ref name="Akhavan 1797–1813"/&gt; One type of encryption, secret key or [[symmetric key]], relies on [[diffusion and confusion]], which is modeled well by chaos theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wang|first=Xingyuan|year=2012|title=An improved key agreement protocol based on chaos|journal=Commun. Nonlinear Sci. Numer. Simul.|volume=15|issue=12|pages=4052–4057|bibcode=2010CNSNS..15.4052W|doi=10.1016/j.cnsns.2010.02.014|author2=Zhao, Jianfeng}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another type of computing, [[DNA computing]], when paired with chaos theory, offers a way to encrypt images and other information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Babaei|first=Majid|year=2013|title=A novel text and image encryption method based on chaos theory and DNA computing|journal=Natural Computing. an International Journal|volume=12|issue=1|pages=101–107|doi=10.1007/s11047-012-9334-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the DNA-Chaos cryptographic algorithms are proven to be either not secure, or the technique applied is suggested to be not efficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Akhavan|first=A.|last2=Samsudin|first2=A.|last3=Akhshani|first3=A.|date=2017-10-01|title=Cryptanalysis of an image encryption algorithm based on DNA encoding|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0030399216308635|journal=Optics &amp; Laser Technology|volume=95|pages=94–99|doi=10.1016/j.optlastec.2017.04.022|bibcode = 2017OptLT..95...94A }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xu|first=Ming|date=2017-06-01|title=Cryptanalysis of an Image Encryption Algorithm Based on DNA Sequence Operation and Hyper-chaotic System|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13319-017-0126-y|journal=3D Research|language=en|volume=8|issue=2|pages=15|doi=10.1007/s13319-017-0126-y|issn=2092-6731|bibcode = 2017TDR.....8..126X }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liu|first=Yuansheng|last2=Tang|first2=Jie|last3=Xie|first3=Tao|date=2014-08-01|title=Cryptanalyzing a RGB image encryption algorithm based on DNA encoding and chaos map|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0030399214000255|journal=Optics &amp; Laser Technology|volume=60|pages=111–115|doi=10.1016/j.optlastec.2014.01.015|arxiv=1307.4279|bibcode = 2014OptLT..60..111L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Robotics ===
Robotics is another area that has recently benefited from chaos theory. Instead of robots acting in a trial-and-error type of refinement to interact with their environment, chaos theory has been used to build a [[Predictive modelling|predictive model]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nehmzow|first=Ulrich|date=Dec 2005|title=Quantitative description of robot–environment interaction using chaos theory|journal=Robotics and Autonomous Systems|volume=53|issue=3–4|pages=177–193|doi=10.1016/j.robot.2005.09.009|author2=Keith Walker|url=http://cswww.essex.ac.uk/staff/udfn/ftp/ecmrw3.pdf|access-date=2017-10-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170812003513/http://cswww.essex.ac.uk/staff/udfn/ftp/ecmrw3.pdf|archive-date=2017-08-12|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Chaotic dynamics have been exhibited by [[Passive dynamics|passive walking]] biped robots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goswami|first=Ambarish|year=1998|title=A Study of the Passive Gait of a Compass-Like Biped Robot: Symmetry and Chaos|journal=The International Journal of Robotics Research|volume=17|issue=12|pages=1282–1301|doi=10.1177/027836499801701202|author2=Thuilot, Benoit|author3=Espiau, Bernard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biology===
For over a hundred years, biologists have been keeping track of populations of different species with [[population model]]s. Most models are [[continuous function|continuous]], but recently scientists have been able to implement chaotic models in certain populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eduardo|first=Liz|author2=Ruiz-Herrera, Alfonso|title=Chaos in discrete structured population models|journal=SIAM Journal on Applied Dynamical Systems|year=2012|volume=11|issue=4|pages=1200–1214|doi=10.1137/120868980}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a study on models of [[Canada lynx|Canadian lynx]] showed there was chaotic behavior in the population growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lai|first=Dejian|title=Comparison study of AR models on the Canadian lynx data: a close look at BDS statistic|journal=Computational Statistics \&amp; Data Analysis|year=1996|volume=22|issue=4|pages=409–423|doi=10.1016/0167-9473(95)00056-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chaos can also be found in ecological systems, such as [[hydrology]]. While a chaotic model for hydrology has its shortcomings, there is still much to learn from looking at the data through the lens of chaos theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sivakumar|first=B|title=Chaos theory in hydrology: important issues and interpretations|journal=Journal of Hydrology|date=31 January 2000|volume=227|issue=1–4|pages=1–20|bibcode=2000JHyd..227....1S|doi=10.1016/S0022-1694(99)00186-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another biological application is found in [[cardiotocography]]. Fetal surveillance is a delicate balance of obtaining accurate information while being as noninvasive as possible. Better models of warning signs of [[Intrauterine hypoxia|fetal hypoxia]] can be obtained through chaotic modeling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bozóki|first=Zsolt|title=Chaos theory and power spectrum analysis in computerized cardiotocography|journal=European Journal of Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology and Reproductive Biology|date=February 1997|volume=71|issue=2|pages=163–168|doi=10.1016/s0301-2115(96)02628-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other areas===
In chemistry, predicting gas solubility is essential to manufacturing [[polymers]], but models using [[particle swarm optimization]] (PSO) tend to converge to the wrong points. An improved version of PSO has been created by introducing chaos, which keeps the simulations from getting stuck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Li|first=Mengshan|author2=Xingyuan Huanga|author3=Hesheng Liua|author4=Bingxiang Liub|author5=Yan Wub|author6=Aihua Xiongc|author7=Tianwen Dong|title=Prediction of gas solubility in polymers by back propagation artificial neural network based on self-adaptive particle swarm optimization algorithm and chaos theory|journal=Fluid Phase Equilibria|date=25 October 2013|volume=356|pages=11–17|doi=10.1016/j.fluid.2013.07.017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[celestial mechanics]], especially when observing asteroids, applying chaos theory leads to better predictions about when these objects will approach Earth and other planets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morbidelli|first=A.|title=Chaotic diffusion in celestial mechanics|journal=Regular &amp; Chaotic Dynamics |year=2001|volume=6|issue=4|pages=339–353|doi=10.1070/rd2001v006n04abeh000182}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four of the five [[moons of Pluto]] rotate chaotically. In [[quantum physics]] and [[electrical engineering]], the study of large arrays of [[Josephson junctions]] benefitted greatly from chaos theory.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Strogatz, ''Sync: The Emerging Science of Spontaneous Order, Hyperion, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Closer to home, coal mines have always been dangerous places where frequent natural gas leaks cause many deaths. Until recently, there was no reliable way to predict when they would occur. But these gas leaks have chaotic tendencies that, when properly modeled, can be predicted fairly accurately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dingqi|first=Li|author2=Yuanping Chenga|author3=Lei Wanga|author4=Haifeng Wanga|author5=Liang Wanga|author6=Hongxing Zhou|title=Prediction method for risks of coal and gas outbursts based on spatial chaos theory using gas desorption index of drill cuttings|journal=Mining Science and Technology|date=May 2011|volume=21|issue=3|pages=439–443}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chaos theory can be applied outside of the natural sciences, but historically nearly all such studies have suffered from lack of reproducibility; poor external validity; and/or inattention to cross-validation, resulting in poor predictive accuracy (if out-of-sample prediction has even been attempted).  Glass &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Glass | first1 = L |editor1-first=C |editor1-last= Grebogi |editor2-first=J. A. | editor2-last=Yorke |title= The impact of chaos on science and society|publisher= United Nations University Press |year=1997 |chapter= Dynamical disease:  The impact of nonlinear dynamics and chaos on cardiology and medicine }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Mandell and Selz &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Mandell |first1= A. J. | last2 = Selz |first2= K. A. |editor1-first=C |editor1-last= Grebogi |editor2-first=J. A. | editor2-last=Yorke |title= The impact of chaos on science and society|publisher= United Nations University Press |year=1997 |chapter= Is the EEG a strange attractor?  }}&lt;/ref&gt; have found that no EEG study has as yet indicated the presence of strange attractors or other signs of chaotic behavior.

Researchers have continued to apply chaos theory to psychology. For example, in modeling group behavior in which heterogeneous members may behave as if sharing to different degrees what in [[Wilfred Bion]]'s theory is a  basic assumption, researchers have found that the group dynamic is the result of the individual dynamics of the members: each individual reproduces the group dynamics in a different scale, and the chaotic behavior of the group is reflected in each member.&lt;ref name="Dal FornoMerlone2013"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dal Forno | first1 = Arianna | last2 = Merlone | first2 = Ugo | title = Nonlinear dynamics in work groups with Bion's basic assumptions | journal = Nonlinear Dynamics, Psychology, and Life Sciences | volume = 17| issue=2 | year = 2013 | pages = 295–315 | issn = 1090-0578  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Redington and Reidbord (1992) attempted to demonstrate that the human heart could display chaotic traits.  They monitored the changes in between-heartbeat intervals for a single psychotherapy patient as she moved through periods of varying emotional intensity during a therapy session.  Results were admittedly inconclusive.  Not only were there ambiguities in the various plots the authors produced to purportedly show evidence of chaotic dynamics (spectral analysis, phase trajectory, and autocorrelation plots), but when they attempted to compute a Lyapunov exponent as more definitive confirmation of chaotic behavior, the authors found they could not reliably do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Redington|first=D. J.|last2=Reidbord|first2=S. P.|title=Chaotic dynamics in autonomic nervous system activity of a patient during a psychotherapy session|journal=Biological Psychiatry|date=1992|volume=31|issue=10|pages=993–1007|pmid=1511082}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their 1995 paper, Metcalf and Allen  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Metcalf |first1= B. R. | last2 = Allen |first2= J. D. |editor1-first=F. D. |editor1-last= Abraham |editor2-first=A. R. | editor2-last=Gilgen |title= Chaos theory in psychology |publisher= Greenwood Press |year=1995 |chapter= In search of chaos in schedule-induced polydipsia }}&lt;/ref&gt; maintained that they uncovered in animal behavior a pattern of period doubling leading to chaos.  The authors examined a well-known response called schedule-induced polydipsia, by which an animal deprived of food for certain lengths of time will drink unusual amounts of water when the food is at last presented.  The control parameter (r) operating here was the length of the interval between feedings, once resumed.  The authors were careful to test a large number of animals and to include many replications, and they designed their experiment so as to rule out the likelihood that changes in response patterns were caused by different starting places for r.

Time series and first delay plots provide the best support for the claims made, showing a fairly clear march from periodicity to irregularity as the feeding times were increased.  The various phase trajectory plots and spectral analyses, on the other hand, do not match up well enough with the other graphs or with the overall theory to lead inexorably to a chaotic diagnosis.  For example, the phase trajectories do not show a definite progression towards greater and greater complexity (and away from periodicity); the process seems quite muddied.  Also, where Metcalf and Allen saw periods of two and six in their spectral plots, there is room for alternative interpretations.  All of this ambiguity necessitate some serpentine, post-hoc explanation to show that results fit a chaotic model.

By adapting a model of career counseling to include a chaotic interpretation of the relationship between employees and the job market, Aniundson and Bright found that better suggestions can be made to people struggling with career decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pryor|first=Robert G. L.|author2=Norman E. Aniundson|author3=Jim E. H. Bright|title=Probabilities and Possibilities: The Strategic Counseling Implications of the Chaos Theory of Careers|journal=The Career Development Quarterly|date=June 2008|volume=56|issue=4|pages=309–318|doi=10.1002/j.2161-0045.2008.tb00096.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern organizations are increasingly seen as open [[complex adaptive system]]s with fundamental natural nonlinear structures, subject to internal and external forces that may contribute chaos. For instance, [[team building]] and [[group development]] is increasingly being researched as an inherently unpredictable system, as the uncertainty of different individuals meeting for the first time makes the trajectory of the team unknowable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thompson|first=Jamie|last2=Johnstone|first2=James|last3=Banks|first3=Curt|date=2018|title=An examination of initiation rituals in a UK sporting institution and the impact on group development|url=http://tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/16184742.2018.1439984|journal=European Sport Management Quarterly|pages=1–19|doi=10.1080/16184742.2018.1439984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some say the chaos metaphor—used in verbal theories—grounded on mathematical models and psychological aspects of human behavior
provides helpful insights to describing the complexity of small work groups, that go beyond the metaphor itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Dal Forno | first1 = Arianna | last2 = Merlone | first2 = Ugo |editor1-first=Gian Italo |editor1-last=Bischi  |editor2-first=Carl | editor2-last=Chiarella |editor3-first=Irina | editor3-last=Shusko |title=Global Analysis of Dynamic Models in Economics and Finance |publisher=Springer-Verlag |year=2013 |pages=185–204 |chapter= Chaotic Dynamics in Organization Theory |isbn= 978-3-642-29503-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every time, all the cars of the same colour try to move one step if there is no car in front of it.

It  is possible that economic models can also be improved through an application of chaos theory, but predicting the health of an economic system and what factors influence it most is an extremely complex task.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Juárez|first=Fernando|title=Applying the theory of chaos and a complex model of health to establish relations among financial indicators|journal=Procedia Computer Science|year=2011|volume=3|pages=982–986|doi=10.1016/j.procs.2010.12.161}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economic and financial systems are fundamentally different from those in the classical natural sciences since the former are inherently stochastic in nature, as they result from the interactions of people, and thus pure deterministic models are unlikely to provide accurate representations of the data. The empirical literature that tests for chaos in economics and finance presents very mixed results, in part due to confusion between specific tests for chaos and more general tests for non-linear relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brooks |first=Chris |authorlink=Chris Brooks (academic)|title=Chaos in foreign exchange markets: a sceptical view |journal=Computational Economics|year=1998 |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=265–281 |issn=1572-9974 |doi=10.1023/A:1008650024944}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traffic forecasting may benefit from applications of chaos theory. Better predictions of when traffic will occur would allow measures to be taken to disperse it before it would have occurred. Combining chaos theory principles with a few other methods has led to a more accurate short-term prediction model (see the plot of the BML traffic model at right).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wang|first=Jin|author2=Qixin Shi|title=Short-term traffic speed forecasting hybrid model based on Chaos–Wavelet Analysis-Support Vector Machine theory|journal=Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies|date=February 2013|volume=27|pages=219–232|doi=10.1016/j.trc.2012.08.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chaos theory has been applied to environmental [[water cycle]] data (aka hydrological data), such as rainfall and streamflow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pasternack.ucdavis.edu/research/projects/chaos-hydrology/|title=Dr. Gregory B. Pasternack – Watershed Hydrology, Geomorphology, and Ecohydraulics :: Chaos in Hydrology|website=pasternack.ucdavis.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These studies have yielded controversial results, because the methods for detecting a chaotic signature are often relatively subjective.  Early studies tended to "succeed" in finding chaos, whereas subsequent studies and meta-analyses called those studies into question and provided explanations for why these datasets are not likely to have low-dimension chaotic dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pasternack|first=Gregory B.|date=1999-11-01|title=Does the river run wild?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2459">{{About|an ecological term||Common (disambiguation)}}

'''Common species''' and '''uncommon species''' are designations used in [[ecology]] to describe the population status of a species.  Commonness is closely related to [[abundance (ecology)|abundance]].  Abundance refers to the frequency with which a species is found in controlled samples; in contrast, species are defined as common or uncommon based on their overall presence in the environment.  A species may be locally abundant without being common.

However, "common" and "uncommon" are also sometimes used to describe levels of abundance, with a common species being less abundant than an abundant species, while an uncommon species is more abundant than a rare species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npwrc.usgs.gov/resource/birds/stcroix/methods.htm|work=Birds of the St. Croix River Valley: Minnesota and Wisconsin|title=Methods, Terminology, and Nomenclature|author=Northern Prairie Wildlife Research Center|accessdate=2006-12-31|year=2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061222235623/http://www.npwrc.usgs.gov/resource/birds/stcroix/methods.htm|archivedate=2006-12-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common species are frequently regarded as being at low risk of extinction simply because they exist in large numbers, and hence their conservation status is often overlooked. While this is broadly logical, there are several cases of once common species being driven to extinction such as the [[passenger pigeon]] and the [[Rocky Mountain locust]], which numbered in the billions and trillions respectively before their demise. Moreover, a small proportional decline in a common species results in the loss of a large number of individuals, and the contribution to ecosystem function that those individuals represented. A recent paper argued that because common species shape ecosystems, contribute disproportionately to ecosystem functioning, and can show rapid population declines, conservation should look more closely at how the trade-off between species extinctions and the depletion of populations.&lt;ref name=gaston&gt;Gaston, K.J. &amp; Fuller, R.A. 2008. Commonness, population depletion and conservation biology. Trends in Ecology and Evolution, 23, 14-19. {{doi|10.1016/j.tree.2007.11.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3783">'''Constructive perception''', is the theory of [[perception]] in which the perceiver uses sensory information and other sources of information to construct a cognitive understanding of a stimulus. In contrast to this top-down approach, there is the bottom-up approach of [[direct perception]].

Also known as intelligent perception, constructive perception shows the relationship between [[intelligence]] and perception. This comes from the importance of high-order thinking and learning in perception. During perception, hypotheses are formed and tested about [[percept]]s that are based on three things: sensory data, knowledge, and high-level cognitive processes. Visual sensations are usually correctly attributed because we unconsciously assimilate information from many sources and then unconsciously make judgments based on this information. The philosophy of [[Immanuel Kant]] explains that our perception of the world is reciprocal; it both is affected by and affects our experience of the world.

== Evidence of constructive perception ==
[[Context effects]] are not explained by bottom-up theories of accounting. [[Irving Biederman]] performed experiments that demonstrated dramatic context effects. For example, Stephen Palmer carried out an experiment in which the participants were asked to identify objects after they were shown either a relevant or irrelevant context. They might be shown a scene of a baseball game, followed by images of a baseball, car, and a phone. The stimuli that was most relevant to the context, the baseball, was recognized quicker than those that were irrelevant, car and phone.

[[Perceptual constancy]] gives evidence that high-level constructive processes occur during perception. As lighting conditions change, the color of objects, such as bananas or cherries, appear to remain constant. Even when there is not enough light to even stimulate [[cone cells]] and give the sensation of color, bananas and cherries are still perceived as yellow and red, respectively.

Configural-superiority effect is another compelling context effect. This effect is demonstrated by the decrease in response time by participants when identifying objects in complex configurations over objects in isolation. For example, four diagonal lines are shown and participants are asked the location of the odd line indicated by its different orientation. In another condition, an "L" shaped fixed context is added; this creates three triangles and another object made of three lines. Participants were able to discern the odd three line object from the set of triangles quicker than the single diagonal lines alone.

== Examples ==
You are traveling down a road you never been on before, up ahead you see an octagonal red sign with white letters near an intersection. The sign has a vine growing on it, and all you can read is "ST_P." These letters alone are meaningless, however taken in its context and using knowledge from past experiences you infer that it is a stop sign. This is example of constructive perception because it required intelligence and thought to combine sensory information, a red octagonal sign with "ST_P" in white letters at an intersection, and knowledge from past experiences, stop signs are red octagonal signs with "STOP" in white letters placed at an intersection, to perceive it as a stop sign.

'''Democide''' is a term proposed by [[R. J. Rummel]] since at least 1994&lt;ref name=harff1996/&gt;&lt;!-- book was 1994; book review published in 1996 --&gt; who defined it as "''the intentional killing of an unarmed or disarmed person by government agents acting in their authoritative capacity and pursuant to government policy or high command''".&lt;ref name="harf@rummel"/&gt; According to him, this definition covers a wide range of deaths, including forced labor and concentration camp victims; killings by "unofficial" private groups; extrajudicial summary killings; and mass deaths due to the governmental acts of criminal omission and neglect, such as in deliberate famines, as well as killings by ''de facto'' governments, i.e. civil war killings.&lt;ref name="harf@rummel"&gt;Barbara Harff. The Comparative Analysis of Mass Atrocities and Genocide. Chapter 12. p. 112-115. in N.P. Gleditsch (ed.), R.J. Rummel: An Assessment of His Many Contributions, SpringerBriefs on Pioneers in Science and Practice 37, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-54463-2. [http://afes-press-books.de/html/SpringerBriefs_PSP_Rummel.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; This definition covers any murder of any number of persons by any government.&lt;ref name="harf@rummel"/&gt;  

Rummel created the term as an extended concept to include forms of government murder not covered by the term genocide. According to Rummel, democide surpassed war as the leading cause of non-natural death in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://democraticpeace.wordpress.com/2009/07/01/democide-vs-other-causes-of-death/|title=Democide Vs. Other Causes of Death|author=R. J. Rummel|date=Feb 1, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=stats&gt;{{cite book|title=Statistics of Democide: Genocide and Mass Murder since 1900|author=R. J. Rummel|year=1998|isbn=978-3825840105|publisher=LIT Verlag}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Three meanings of genocide==
{{Genocide}}
Democide is the murder of any person or people by their government, including genocide, politicide and mass murder. Democide is not necessarily the elimination of entire cultural groups but rather groups within the country that the government feels need to be eradicated for political reasons and due to claimed future threats.

According to Rummel, genocide has three different meanings.

# The '''ordinary''' meaning is murder by government of people due to their national, ethnic, racial or religious group membership. 
# The '''legal''' meaning of genocide refers to the international treaty on genocide, the [[Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide]].  This also includes nonlethal acts that in the end eliminate or greatly hinder the group. Looking back on history, one can see the different variations of democides that have occurred, but it still consists of acts of killing or mass murder. 
# '''Democide''' – This generalized meaning of genocide is similar to the ordinary meaning but also includes government killings of political opponents or otherwise intentional murder. In order to avoid confusion over which meaning is intended. Rummel created the term democide for this third meaning.&lt;ref name="Genocide"&gt;[http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/GENOCIDE.HTM Genocide].&lt;/ref&gt;

The objectives of democide include the disintegration of the political and social institutions of culture, language, national feelings, religion, and the economic existence of national groups; the destruction of the personal security, liberty, health, dignity; and even the lives of the individuals belonging to such groups.&lt;ref&gt;Lemkin, Raphael. ''Axis Rule in Occupied Europe'', 1944.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

Some examples of democide cited by Rummel include [[the Great Purges]] carried out by [[Joseph Stalin]] in the [[Soviet Union]], the deaths from the [[Colonialism|colonial]] policy in the [[Congo Free State]], and [[Mao Zedong]]'s [[Great Leap Forward]], which resulted in a [[Great Chinese Famine|famine that killed millions of people]]. According to Rummel, these were not cases of genocide because those who were killed were not selected on the basis of their race, but were killed in large numbers as a result of government policies. Famine is classified by Rummel as democide if it fits the definition above.

For instance, Rummel re-classified [[Mao Zedong]]'s Great Leap Forward as democide in 2005. He originally believed that Mao's policies were largely responsible for the famine, but that Mao's advisers had misled him. Therefore, he believed it was not an intentional famine and thus not a democide. However, reports from [[Jung Chang]] and [[Jon Halliday]]'s ''[[Mao: The Unknown Story]]'' allege that Mao knew about the famine from the beginning but did not care, and eventually Mao had to be stopped by a meeting of 7,000 top Communist Party members. Based on this new evidence, Rummel now believes the famine was intentional and considers it a democide. Taking this into account, the total for Chinese Communist Party democide is 80.86 million, more than the Soviet Union (62 million), Nazi Germany (21 million), or any other regime in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://democraticpeace.wordpress.com/2008/11/24/getting-my-reestimate-of-maos-democide-out/|title=Getting My Reestimate Of Mao's Democide Out|date=2005-11-30|accessdate=2007-04-09|author=R.J. Rummel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Democide ==
In his estimates, Rummel relies mostly on historical accounts, an approach that rarely provides accurate estimates. His estimates typically include a wide range and cannot be considered determinative.&lt;ref name=harff1996&gt;Barbara Harff. Reviewed Work(s): [https://www.jstor.org/stable/206491 Death by Government] by R. J. Rummel, ''The Journal of Interdisciplinary History'', Vol. 27, No. 1 (Summer, 1996), pp. 117-119. Published by: The MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Thus, Rummel calculates nearly 43 million deaths due to democide inside and outside the Soviet Union during Stalin's regime.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/DBG.TAB1.4.GIF&lt;/ref&gt; This is much higher than an often quoted figure of 20 million, or a more recent figure of 9 million&lt;ref&gt;Tymothy Snyder. Hitler vs. Stalin: Who was worse? ''The New York Review of Books'' January 27, 2011,[http://www.nybooks.com/daily/2011/01/27/hitler-vs-stalin-who-was-worse/]&lt;/ref&gt;. Rummel has responded that the 20 million estimate is based on a figure from  [[Robert Conquest]]'s 1968 book ''[[The Great Terror]]'', and that Conquest's qualifier "almost certainly too low" is usually forgotten. Conquest's calculations excluded camp deaths before 1936 and after 1950, executions from 1939–1953, the vast deportation of the people of captive nations into the camps and their deaths 1939–1953, the massive deportation within the Soviet Union of minorities 1941–1944 and their deaths, and those the Soviet Red Army and secret police executed throughout Eastern Europe after their conquest during 1944–1945. Moreover, the [[Holodomor]] that killed 5 million in 1932–1934 is also not included.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

His research shows that the death toll from democide is far greater than the death toll from war. After studying over 8,000 reports of government-caused deaths, Rummel estimates that there have been 262 million victims of democide in the last century.  According to his figures, six times as many people have died from the actions of people working for governments than have died in battle.

One of his main findings is that liberal democracies have much less democide than authoritarian regimes.&lt;ref name="Miracle"&gt;[http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/MIRACLE.HTM Miracle].&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that there is a relation between political power and democide. Political mass murder grows increasingly common as political power becomes unconstrained. At the other end of the scale, where power is diffuse, checked, and balanced, political violence is a rarity. According to Rummel, "The more power a regime has, the more likely people will be killed. This is a  major reason for promoting freedom." Rummel concludes that "concentrated political power is the most dangerous thing on earth."

Several other researchers have found similar results. "Numerous researchers point out that democratic norms and political structures constrain elite decisions about the use of repression against their citizens whereas autocratic elites are not so constrained. Once in place, democratic institutions—even partial ones—reduce the likelihood of armed conflict and all but eliminate the risk that it will lead to geno/politicide."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cidcm.umd.edu/inscr/genocide/ Genocide] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030201259/http://www.cidcm.umd.edu/inscr/genocide/ |date=2007-10-30 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers often give widely different estimates of mass murder. They use different definitions, methodology, and sources. For example, some include battle deaths in their calculations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13836">In [[Uncertainty principle#Quantum_entropic_uncertainty_principle|quantum mechanics]], [[information theory]], and [[Fourier analysis]], the '''entropic uncertainty''' or '''Hirschman uncertainty''' is defined as the sum of the temporal and spectral [[Shannon entropy|Shannon entropies]].  It turns out that Heisenberg's [[uncertainty principle]] can be expressed as a lower bound on the sum of these entropies.  This is ''stronger'' than the usual statement of the uncertainty principle in terms of the product of standard deviations.

In 1957,&lt;ref name=Hirschman&gt;{{Citation |first=I. I., Jr. |last=Hirschman |title=A note on entropy |journal=[[American Journal of Mathematics]] |year=1957 |volume=79 |issue=1 |pages=152–156 |doi=10.2307/2372390 |postscript=. |jstor=2372390 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Isidore Isaac Hirschman, Jr.|Hirschman]] considered a function ''f'' and its [[Fourier transform]] ''g'' such that
:&lt;math&gt;g(y) \approx \int_{-\infty}^\infty \exp (-2\pi ixy) f(x)\, dx,\qquad f(x) \approx \int_{-\infty}^\infty \exp (2\pi ixy) g(y)\, dy  ~,&lt;/math&gt;
where the   "≈" indicates convergence in {{mvar|L}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and normalized so that (by [[Plancherel theorem|Plancherel's theorem]]),
:&lt;math&gt; \int_{-\infty}^\infty |f(x)|^2\, dx = \int_{-\infty}^\infty |g(y)|^2 \,dy = 1~.&lt;/math&gt;

He showed that for any such functions the sum of the Shannon entropies is non-negative,
:&lt;math&gt; H(|f|^2) + H(|g|^2) \equiv - \int_{-\infty}^\infty |f(x)|^2 \log |f(x)|^2\, dx - \int_{-\infty}^\infty |g(y)|^2 \log |g(y)|^2 \,dy \ge 0. &lt;/math&gt;

A tighter bound,

Note, however, that the above entropic uncertainty function is distinctly ''different'' from the quantum [[Von Neumann entropy]] represented in [[phase space]].

==Sketch of proof==
The proof of this tight inequality depends on the so-called '''(''q'',&amp;nbsp;''p'')-norm''' of the Fourier transformation.  (Establishing this norm is the most difficult part of the proof.)

From this norm, one is able to establish a lower bound on the sum of the (differential) [[Rényi entropy|Rényi entropies]], {{math| ''H&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;({{!}}f{{!}}²)+H&lt;sub&gt;β&lt;/sub&gt;({{!}}g{{!}}²)'' }}, where {{math|''1/α + 1/β'' {{=}} 2}}, which generalize the Shannon entropies.  For simplicity, we consider this inequality only in one dimension; the extension to multiple dimensions is straightforward and can be found in the literature cited.

===Babenko–Beckner inequality===
The '''(''q'',&amp;nbsp;''p'')-norm''' of the Fourier transform is defined to be&lt;ref name=Bialynicki&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevA.74.052101| title = Formulation of the uncertainty relations in terms of the Rényi entropies| journal = Physical Review A| volume = 74| issue = 5| year = 2006| last1 = Bialynicki-Birula | first1 = I. |arxiv = quant-ph/0608116 |bibcode = 2006PhRvA..74e2101B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\|\mathcal F\|_{q,p} = \sup_{f\in L^p(\mathbb R)} \frac{\|\mathcal Ff\|_q}{\|f\|_p},&lt;/math&gt;   where &lt;math&gt;1 &lt; p \le 2~,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; and &lt;math&gt;\frac 1 p + \frac 1 q = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

In 1961, Babenko&lt;ref&gt;K.I. Babenko.  ''An inequality in the theory of Fourier integrals.'' Izv. Akad. Nauk SSSR, Ser. Mat. '''25''' (1961) pp. 531&amp;ndash;542 English transl., Amer. Math. Soc. Transl. (2) '''44''', pp. 115-128&lt;/ref&gt; found this norm for ''even'' integer values of ''q''.  Finally, in 1975,
using [[Hermite functions]] as eigenfunctions of the Fourier transform, Beckner&lt;ref name=Beckner/&gt; proved that the value of this norm (in one dimension) for all ''q''  ≥  2  is
:&lt;math&gt;\|\mathcal F\|_{q,p} = \sqrt{p^{1/p}/q^{1/q}}.&lt;/math&gt;
Thus we have the '''[[Babenko–Beckner inequality]]''' that
:&lt;math&gt;\|\mathcal Ff\|_q \le \left(p^{1/p}/q^{1/q}\right)^{1/2} \|f\|_p.&lt;/math&gt;

===Rényi entropy bound===
From this inequality, an expression of the uncertainty principle in terms of the [[Rényi entropy]] can be derived.&lt;ref name=Bialynicki/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H.P. Heinig and M. Smith, ''Extensions of the Heisenberg–Weil inequality.'' Internat. J. Math. &amp; Math. Sci., Vol. 9, No. 1 (1986) pp. 185&amp;ndash;192. [http://www.hindawi.com/GetArticle.aspx?doi=10.1155/S0161171286000212]&lt;/ref&gt;

Letting &lt;math&gt;g=\mathcal Ff&lt;/math&gt;,  2''α''=''p'',  and 2''β''=''q'',   so that  {{math|''1/α + 1/β'' {{=}} 2}}  and   1/2&lt;''α''&lt;1&lt;''β'',  we have
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\int_{\mathbb R} |g(y)|^{2\beta}\,dy\right)^{1/2\beta}
       \le \frac{(2\alpha)^{1/4\alpha}}{(2\beta)^{1/4\beta}}
       \left(\int_{\mathbb R} |f(x)|^{2\alpha}\,dx\right)^{1/2\alpha}.
&lt;/math&gt;
Squaring both sides and taking the logarithm, we get
:&lt;math&gt;\frac 1\beta \log\left(\int_{\mathbb R} |g(y)|^{2\beta}\,dy\right)
       \le \frac 1 2 \log\frac{(2\alpha)^{1/\alpha}}{(2\beta)^{1/\beta}}
       + \frac 1\alpha \log \left(\int_{\mathbb R} |f(x)|^{2\alpha}\,dx\right).
&lt;/math&gt;

Multiplying both sides by 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\beta}{1-\beta}=-\frac{\alpha}{1-\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; 
reverses the sense of the inequality,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {1}{1-\beta} \log\left(\int_{\mathbb R} |g(y)|^{2\beta}\,dy\right)
       \ge \frac\alpha{2(\alpha-1)}\log\frac{(2\alpha)^{1/\alpha}}{(2\beta)^{1/\beta}}
       - \frac{1}{1-\alpha} \log \left(\int_{\mathbb R} |f(x)|^{2\alpha}\,dx\right) ~.
&lt;/math&gt;

Rearranging terms, finally yields  an inequality in terms of the sum of the Rényi entropies,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{1-\alpha} \log \left(\int_{\mathbb R} |f(x)|^{2\alpha}\,dx\right)
       + \frac {1}{1-\beta} \log\left(\int_{\mathbb R} |g(y)|^{2\beta}\,dy\right)
       \ge \frac\alpha{2(\alpha-1)}\log\frac{(2\alpha)^{1/\alpha}}{(2\beta)^{1/\beta}};
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; H_\alpha(|f|^2) + H_\beta(|g|^2) \ge \frac 1 2 \left(\frac{\log\alpha}{\alpha-1}+\frac{\log\beta}{\beta-1}\right) - \log 2     ~.&lt;/math&gt;

Note that this inequality is symmetric with respect to  {{mvar|α}}  and {{mvar|β}}:  One no longer need assume that {{math|'' α&lt;β''}};  only that they are positive and not both one, and that  ''1/α + 1/β''   = 2.    To see this symmetry, simply exchange the rôles of  ''i''  and −''i''  in the Fourier transform.

===Shannon entropy bound===
Taking the limit of this last inequality as ''α, β''  → 1 yields the less general Shannon entropy inequality,
:&lt;math&gt;H(|f|^2) + H(|g|^2) \ge \log\frac e 2,\quad\textrm{where}\quad g(y) \approx \int_{\mathbb R} e^{-2\pi ixy}f(x)\,dx~,&lt;/math&gt;
valid for any base of logarithm, as long as we choose an appropriate unit of information, [[bit]], [[Nat (unit)|nat]], etc.

The constant will be different, though, for a different normalization of the Fourier transform, (such as is usually used in physics, with normalizations chosen so that ''ħ''=1 ), i.e.,
:&lt;math&gt;H(|f|^2) + H(|g|^2) \ge \log(\pi e)\quad\textrm{for}\quad g(y) \approx \frac 1{\sqrt{2\pi}}\int_{\mathbb R} e^{-ixy}f(x)\,dx~.&lt;/math&gt;
In this case, the dilation of the Fourier transform absolute squared by a factor of 2{{mvar|π}}  simply adds log(2{{mvar|π}}) to its entropy.

==Entropy versus variance bounds==
The Gaussian or [[normal probability distribution]] plays an important role in the relationship between [[variance]] and [[Differential entropy|entropy]]:  it is a problem of the [[calculus of variations]] to show that this distribution maximizes entropy for a given variance, and at the same time minimizes the variance for a given entropy.  In fact, for any probability density function  ''φ'' on the real line, Shannon's entropy inequality specifies:
:&lt;math&gt;H(\phi) \le \log \sqrt {2\pi eV(\phi)},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''H'' is the Shannon entropy and ''V'' is the variance, an inequality that is saturated only in the case of a [[normal distribution]].

Moreover, the Fourier transform of a Gaussian probability amplitude function is also Gaussian—and the absolute squares of both of these are Gaussian, too.  This  can then be used to derive the usual Robertson variance uncertainty inequality from the above entropic inequality, enabling ''the latter to be tighter than the former''. That is (for ''ħ''=1), exponentiating the Hirschman inequality and using Shannon's expression above, 
:&lt;math&gt;1/2 \le \exp (H(|f|^2)+H(|g|^2))         /(2e\pi)    \le \sqrt {V(|f|^2)V(|g|^2)}~.&lt;/math&gt;

Hirschman&lt;ref name=Hirschman/&gt; explained that entropy—his version of entropy was the negative of Shannon's—is a "measure of the concentration of [a probability distribution] in a set of small measure."  Thus ''a low or large negative Shannon entropy means that a considerable mass of the probability distribution is confined to a set of small measure''.

Note that this set of small measure need not be contiguous; a probability distribution can have several concentrations of mass in intervals of small measure, and the entropy may still be low no matter how widely scattered those intervals are.  This is not the case with the variance:  variance measures the concentration of mass about the mean of the distribution, and a low variance means that a considerable mass of the probability distribution is concentrated in a ''contiguous interval'' of small measure.

To formalize this distinction,  we say that two probability density functions  ''φ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;  and ''φ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are '''equimeasurable''' if
:&lt;math&gt;\forall \delta &gt; 0,\,\mu\{x\in\mathbb R|\phi_1(x)\ge\delta\} = \mu\{x\in\mathbb R|\phi_2(x)\ge\delta\},&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|μ}}  is the [[Lebesgue measure]].  Any two equimeasurable probability density functions have the same Shannon entropy, and in fact the same Rényi entropy, of any order.  The same is not true of variance, however.  Any probability density function has a radially decreasing equimeasurable "rearrangement" whose variance is less (up to translation) than any other rearrangement of the function; and there exist rearrangements of arbitrarily high variance, (all having the same entropy.)

==The Franklin Method==
The Franklin Method (in German [[:de:Franklin-Methode|Franklin-Methode]]) was founded in 1994, and was originally for dancers. It was inspired by [[Mabel Elsworth Todd]]'s [[ideokinesis]], Bonnie Bainbridge Cohen's Body-Mind Centering&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bodymindcentering.com/Bonnie/ Body-Mind Centering]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sri Aurobindo]]’s Integral Yoga. Extended from [[dance]] field to every kind of human movement, this method combines dynamic science-based [[imagery]], touch, anatomical embodiment and educational skills to create lasting positive change in body and mind, using a range of simple tools, like balls, Theraband,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nureyev-medical.org/ ''Dance Specific Theraband Conditioning'' article by Eric Franklin, IADMS conference 2003, in Rudolf Nureyev Foundation Medical website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thera-band.com/ Thera-Band website]&lt;/ref&gt; and other daily life objects.

Imagery promotes a neurogenic changement of muscular condition which allows immediate results, before any myogenic (muscle tissue) one. Connective tissue and inner organs are also directly stimulated, with touch and visualization, in order to change posture and to obtain an inner and outer balance.The exercises have a considerable impact on lowering structural stress, too.

The method is taught all over the world, including the Universities of [[Vienna]], [[Cologne]], [[Karlsruhe]], The Boston Conservatory and the Juilliard School in [[New York City]].

'''Eternal return''' (also known as '''eternal recurrence''') is a theory that the [[universe]] and all existence and energy has been recurring, and will continue to recur, in a [[self-similar]] form an [[infinity|infinite]] number of times across infinite time or space.
The theory is found in [[Indian philosophy]] and in [[ancient Egypt]] and was subsequently taken up by the [[Pythagoreans]] and [https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/stoicism/ Stoics]. With the decline of [[classical antiquity|antiquity]] and the spread of [[Christianity]], the theory fell into disuse in the [[Western world]], with the exception of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], who connected the thought to many of his other concepts, including ''[[amor fati]]''. Eternal return is based on the philosophy of pre-determinism in that people are predestined to continue repeating the same events over and over again.

==Premise==
The basic premise proceeds from the assumption that the [[probability]] of a world coming into existence exactly like our own is nonzero. If [[space]] and time are infinite, then it follows logically that our existence must recur an infinite number of times.&lt;ref&gt;Tegmark M., "Parallel universes". Sci. Am. 2003 May; 288(5):40–51.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1871 [[Louis Auguste Blanqui]], assuming a Newtonian cosmology where time and space are infinite, claimed to have demonstrated eternal recurrence as a mathematical certainty.&lt;ref&gt;

== Classical antiquity ==

[[File:Egypt.KV6.04.jpg|thumb|right|[[Scarabaeus sacer|Scarab]] on a [[fresco]].]]

In [[ancient Egypt]], the scarab ([[dung beetle]]) was viewed as a sign of eternal renewal and reemergence of life, a reminder of the life to come. (See also [[Atum]] and [[Ma'at]].)

The [[Maya calendar#Maya concepts of time|Mayans]] and [[Aztec calendar|Aztecs]] also took a cyclical view of time.

In [[ancient Greece]], the concept of eternal return was connected with [[Empedocles]], [[Zeno of Citium]], and most notably in [[Stoicism]] (see [[ekpyrosis]]).

== Indian religions ==
{{Religious text primary|section|date=February 2018}}
{{See also|End time in Indian religions}}
The concept of cyclical patterns is prominent in [[Indian religions]], such as [[Jainism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Sikhism]] and [[Buddhism]] among others. The important distinction is that events don't repeat endlessly but souls take birth until they attain salvation. The [[Bhavacakra|wheel of life]] represents an endless cycle of birth, life, and death from which one seeks liberation.  In [[Tantric Buddhism]], a [[wheel of time]] concept known as the [[Kalachakra]] expresses the idea of an endless cycle of existence and knowledge.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

== Friedrich Nietzsche&lt;!--linked from 'Amor fati'--&gt; ==
The concept of "eternal recurrence", the idea that with infinite time and a finite number of events, events will recur again and again infinitely, is central to the writings of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].&lt;ref&gt;http://myweb.lmu.edu/tshanahan/Nietzsche-Eternal_Recurrence.html&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Heidegger]] points out in his lectures on Nietzsche, Nietzsche's first mention of eternal recurrence, in aphorism 341 of ''[[The Gay Science]]'' (cited below), presents this concept as a [[Thought experiment|hypothetical ''question'']] rather than postulating it as a fact.  According to Heidegger, it is the burden imposed by the ''question'' of eternal recurrence—whether or not such a thing could possibly be true—that is so significant in modern thought: "The way Nietzsche here patterns the first communication of the thought of the 'greatest burden' [of eternal recurrence] makes it clear that this 'thought of thoughts' is at the same time 'the most burdensome thought.' "&lt;ref&gt;See Heidegger ''Nietzsche. Volume II: The Eternal Recurrence of the Same'' trans. [[David Farrell Krell]]. New York: Harper and Row, 1984. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

The thought of eternal recurrence appears in a few of his works, in particular §285 and §341 of ''[[The Gay Science]]'' and then in ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]''. The most complete treatment of the subject appears in the work entitled ''Notes on the Eternal Recurrence'', a work which was published in 2007 alongside [[Søren Kierkegaard]]'s own version of eternal return, which he calls 'repetition'. Nietzsche sums up his thought most succinctly when he addresses the reader with: "Everything has returned. Sirius,  and the spider, and thy thoughts at this moment, and this last thought of thine that all things will return". However, he also expresses his thought at greater length when he says to his reader:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Whoever thou mayest be, beloved stranger, whom I meet here for the first time, avail thyself of this happy hour and of the stillness around us, and above us, and let me tell thee something of the thought which has suddenly risen before me like a star which would fain shed down its rays upon thee and every one, as befits the nature of light. - Fellow man! Your whole life, like a sandglass, will always be reversed and will ever run out again, - a long minute of time will elapse until all those conditions out of which you were evolved return in the wheel of the cosmic process. And then you will find every pain and every pleasure, every friend and every enemy, every hope and every error, every blade of grass and every ray of sunshine once more, and the whole fabric of things which make up your life. This ring in which you are but a grain will glitter afresh forever. And in every one of these cycles of human life there will be one hour where, for the first time one man, and then many, will perceive the mighty thought of the eternal recurrence of all things:- and for mankind this is always the hour of Noon".&lt;ref&gt;''Notes on the Eternal Recurrence'' - Vol. 16 of Oscar Levy Edition of Nietzsche's Complete Works (in English)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This thought is indeed also noted in a posthumous fragment.&lt;ref&gt;1881 (11 [143])&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of this thought is dated by Nietzsche himself, via posthumous fragments, to August 1881, at [[Sils im Engadin/Segl|Sils-Maria]]. In ''[[Ecce Homo (book)|Ecce Homo]]'' (1888), he wrote that he thought of the eternal return as the "fundamental conception" of ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra''.&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, [[Ecce Homo (book)|Ecce Homo]], "Why I Write Such Good Books", "Thus Spoke Zarathustra", §1&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Am Stein der Ewigen Wiederkunft.JPG|thumb|Scene of Nietzsche's inspiration: „by a massive, pyramidally piled up block not far from [[Surlej|Surlei]]“.]]

Several authors have pointed out other occurrences of this hypothesis in contemporary thought. [[Rudolf Steiner]], who revised the first catalogue of Nietzsche's personal library in January 1896, pointed out that Nietzsche would have read something similar in [[Eugen Dühring]]'s ''Courses on philosophy'' (1875), which Nietzsche readily criticized. [[Lou Andreas-Salomé]] pointed out that Nietzsche referred to ancient cyclical conceptions of time, in particular by the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]], in the ''Untimely Meditations''. [[Henri Lichtenberger]] and [[Charles Andler]] have pinpointed three works contemporary to Nietzsche which carried on the same hypothesis: J.G. Vogt, ''Die Kraft. Eine real-monistische Weltanschauung'' (1878), [[Auguste Blanqui]], ''[http://classiques.uqac.ca/classiques/blanqui_louis_auguste/eternite_par_les_astres/eternite_.html L'éternité par les astres]'' (1872) and [[Gustave Le Bon]], ''L'homme et les sociétés'' (1881). [[Walter Benjamin]] juxtaposes Blanqui and Nietzsche's discussion of eternal recurrence in his unfinished, monumental work ''[[The Arcades Project]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Benjamin]]. ''The Arcades Project''. Trans. Howard Eiland and Kevin McLaughlin. Cambridge: Belknap-Harvard, 2002. See chapter D, "Boredom Eternal Return," pp. 101-119.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Gustave Le Bon is not quoted anywhere in Nietzsche's manuscripts; and Auguste Blanqui was named only in 1883. Vogt's work, on the other hand, was read by Nietzsche during this summer of 1881 in Sils-Maria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.item.ens.fr/nietzsche/bn.html |title=? |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061116044517/http://www.item.ens.fr/nietzsche/bn.html |archivedate=November 16, 2006 }} and {{cite web |url=http://www.item.ens.fr/nietzsche/bn/catalogues.html |title=revision of previous catalogues }} on the [[École Normale Supérieure]]'s website&lt;/ref&gt; Blanqui is mentioned by [[Albert Lange]] in his ''[[Geschichte des Materialismus]]'' (History of Materialism), a book closely read by Nietzsche.&lt;ref name=Fouillee&gt;Alfred Fouillée, [http://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Note_sur_Nietzsche_et_Lange_:_%C2%AB_le_retour_%C3%A9ternel_%C2%BB "Note sur Nietzsche et Lange: le "retour éternel"], in ''Revue philosophique de la France et de l'étranger''. An. 34. Paris 1909. T. 67, S. 519-525 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The eternal recurrence is also mentioned in passing by the Devil in Part Four, Book XI, Chapter 9 of Dostoevsky's ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]'', which is another possible source that Nietzsche may have been drawing upon.

[[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] suggests that Nietzsche may have encountered this idea in the works of [[Heinrich Heine]], who once wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]ime is infinite, but the things in time, the concrete bodies, are finite. They may indeed disperse into the smallest particles; but these particles, the atoms, have their determinate numbers, and the numbers of the configurations which, all of themselves, are formed out of them is also determinate. Now, however long a time may pass, according to the eternal laws governing the combinations of this eternal play of repetition, all configurations which have previously existed on this earth must yet meet, attract, repulse, kiss, and corrupt each other again...&lt;ref&gt;Kaufmann, Walter. ''Nietzsche; Philosopher, Psychologist, Antichrist.'' 1959, page 376.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nietzsche calls the idea "horrifying and paralyzing",{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} referring to it as a burden of the "heaviest weight" ("''das schwerste Gewicht''")&lt;ref&gt;Kundera, Milan. ''The Unbearable Lightness of Being''. 1999, page 5.&lt;/ref&gt; imaginable.  He professes that the wish for the eternal return of all events would mark the ultimate affirmation of life:

&lt;blockquote&gt;What, if some day or night a demon were to steal after you into your loneliest loneliness and say to you: 'This life as you now live it and have lived it, you will have to live once more and innumerable times more' ... Would you not throw yourself down and gnash your teeth and curse the demon who spoke thus? Or have you once experienced a tremendous moment when you would have answered him: 'You are a god and never have I heard anything more divine.{{'}} [''[[The Gay Science]]'', §341]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To comprehend eternal recurrence in his thought, and to not merely come to peace with it but to embrace it, requires ''[[amor fati]]'', "love of fate":&lt;ref name=dudl&gt;Dudley, Will. ''Hegel, Nietzsche, and Philosophy: Thinking Freedom''. 2002, page 201.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;My formula for human greatness is ''amor fati'': that one wants to have nothing different, not forward, not backward, not in all eternity. Not merely to bear the necessary, still less to conceal it—all idealism is mendaciousness before the necessary—but to ''love'' it.&lt;ref name=dudl /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In Carl Jung's seminar on ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'', Jung claims that the dwarf states the idea of the eternal return before Zarathustra finishes his argument of the eternal return when the dwarf says, "'Everything straight lies,' murmured the dwarf disdainfully.  'All truth is crooked, time itself is a circle.'" However, Zarathustra rebuffs the dwarf in the following paragraph, warning him against over-simplifications.&lt;ref&gt;Gildersleeve, M. (2015). The Gay Science and the Rosarium Philosophorum. Agathos, 6(2), 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Albert Camus ==
The philosopher and writer [[Albert Camus]] explores the notion of "eternal return" in his essay on "The Myth of Sisyphus", in which the repetitive nature of existence comes to represent life's absurdity, something the hero seeks to withstand through manifesting what [[Paul Tillich]] called "The Courage to Be".  Though the task of rolling the stone repeatedly up the hill without end is inherently meaningless, the challenge faced by Sisyphus is to refrain from despair.  Hence Camus famously concludes that, "one must imagine Sisyphus happy."

== Opposing argument ==

Nietzsche scholar [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] has described an argument originally put forward by [[Georg Simmel]], which rebuts the claim that a finite number of states must repeat within an infinite amount of time:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Even if there were exceedingly few things in a finite space in an infinite time, they would not have to repeat in the same configurations. Suppose there were three wheels of equal size, rotating on the same axis, one point marked on the circumference of each wheel, and these three points lined up in one straight line. If the second wheel rotated twice as fast as the first, and if the speed of the third wheel was 1/π of the speed of the first, the initial line-up would never recur.&lt;ref&gt;Kaufmann, Walter. ''Nietzsche: Philosopher, Psychologist, Antichrist''. (Fourth Edition)  Princeton University Press, 1974. p327&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Thus a system could have an infinite number of distinct physical configurations that never recur. However the example presupposes the possibility of perfect continuity: for instance, if the universe proves to have a [[quantum foam]] nature, then the exact quantity of an irrational number cannot be expressed by any physical object.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10277">In [[evolutionary biology]], the '''flying primate hypothesis''' posits that [[megabat]]s, a subgroup of [[Chiroptera]] (also known as [[Pteropus|flying fox]]es), form an evolutionary [[sister group]] of [[primate]]s. The [[hypothesis]] began with [[Carl Linnaeus]] in 1758, and was again advanced by J.D. Smith in 1980.&lt;ref name="pmid18367343"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pettigrew JD, Maseko BC, Manger PR |title=Primate-like retinotectal decussation in an echolocating megabat, ''Rousettus aegyptiacus'' |journal=Neuroscience |volume=153 |issue=1 |pages=226–31 |date=April 2008 |pmid=18367343 |doi=10.1016/j.neuroscience.2008.02.019 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Smith JD (1980) Chiropteran phylogenetics: introduction.

This was followed up by a longer study published in 1989,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pettigrew JD, Jamieson BG, Robson SK, Hall LS, McAnally KI, Cooper HM |year=1989 |title=Phylogenetic relations between microbats, megabats and primates (Mammalia: Chiroptera and Primates) |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London. Series B, Biological Sciences |volume=325 |pages=489–559 |doi=10.1098/rstb.1989.0102|issue=1229}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which this was supported by the analysis of many other [[brain]] and body characteristics. Pettigrew suggested that flying foxes, [[colugo]]s, and primates were all descendants of the same group of early [[arboreal]] mammals. The megabat flight and the colugo [[Gliding flight|gliding]] could be both seen as locomotory adaptations to a life high above the ground.

The flying primate hypothesis met resistance from many zoologists. Its biggest challenges were not centered on the argument that megabats and primates are evolutionarily related, which reflects earlier ideas (such as the grouping of primates, [[tree shrew]]s, colugos, and [[bat]]s under the same [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] group, the [[Superorder]] [[Archonta]]). Rather, many biologists resisted the implication that megabats and [[microbat]]s (or [[animal echolocation#Bats|echolocating]] bats) formed distinct branches of mammalian [[evolution]], with flight having [[convergent evolution|evolved twice]]. This implication was borne out of the fact that microbats do not resemble primates in any of the neural characteristics studied by Pettigrew, instead resembling primitive mammals such as [[Insectivora]] in these respects. The advanced brain characters demonstrated in ''Pteropus'' could not, therefore, be generalized to imply that all bats are similar to primates.

More recently, the flying primate hypothesis was rejected when scientists compared the DNA of bats to that of primates. These genetic studies support the [[monophyly]] of bats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1073/pnas.111551998 |date=May 2001 |author1=Springer, Ms |author2=Teeling, Ec |author3=Madsen, O |author4=Stanhope, Mj |author5=De, Jong, Ww | title=Integrated fossil and molecular data reconstruct bat echolocation | volume=98 | issue=11 | pages=6241–6 | pmid=11353869 | pmc=33452 | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11353869 | format=Free full text}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Primitive Early Eocene bat from Wyoming and the evolution of flight and echolocation | doi=10.1038/nature06549 | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v451/n7180/abs/nature06549.html | accessdate=2008-07-03 | date=2008-02-14 | work=Nature | volume=451 | issue=7180 | pages=818–821}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1126/science.1105113 |date=January 2005 |author1=Teeling, Ec |author2=Springer, Ms |author3=Madsen, O |author4=Bates, P |author5=O'Brien, Sj |author6=Murphy, Wj | title=A molecular phylogeny for bats illuminates biogeography and the fossil record | volume=307 | issue=5709 | pages=580–4 | pmid=15681385 | journal=Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=September 2005 |author1=Eick, Gn |author2=Jacobs, Ds |author3=Matthee, Ca | title=A nuclear DNA phylogenetic perspective on the evolution of echolocation and historical biogeography of extant bats (chiroptera) | volume=22 | issue=9 | pages=1869–86 | pmid=15930153 | journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution | url=http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=15930153 | format=Free full text | doi=10.1093/molbev/msi180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neurological studies==
Soon after Pettigrew's study, work on another genus of megabat (''[[Rousettus]]'') disputed the existence of an advanced pattern of connections between the [[retina]] and the [[superior colliculus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Thiele A, Vogelsang M, Hoffmann KP |year=1991 |title=Pattern of retinotectal projection in the megachiropteran bat ''Rousettus aegyptiacus'' |journal= Journal of Comparative Neurology |doi=10.1002/cne.903140404 |volume=314 |pages=671–683 | pmid=1816270 | issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this conclusion was later criticised on methodological grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rosa MG, Schmid LM |year=1994 |title=Topography and extent of visual-field representation in the superior colliculus of the megachiropteran Pteropus |journal=Visual Neuroscience |volume=11 |issue=6 |pages=1037–1057 | doi=10.1017/S0952523800006878 | pmid=7841115}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later studies have sought further evidence of unique characteristics linking the megabat and primate brains. These studies have had limited success in identifying unique links between megabats and present-day primates, instead concluding that the megabat brain has characteristics that may resemble those likely to have existed in primitive primate brains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ichida JM, Rosa MG, Casagrande VA |year=2000 |title=Does the visual system of the flying fox resemble that of primates?

==Biochemical studies==
The implication that bats are [[diphyletic]] has been fiercely disputed by many zoologists, not only based on the unlikelihood that [[wing]]s would have evolved twice in mammals, but also on biochemical studies of molecular evolution, which indicate that bats are [[monophyletic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mindell DP, Dick CW, Baker RJ |year=1991 |title=Phylogenetic relationships among megabats, microbats, and primates |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA |volume=88 |issue=22 |pages=10322–10326 |doi=10.1073/pnas.88.22.10322 | pmid = 1658803 | pmc = 52920}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Stanhope MJ, Czelusniak J, Si JS, Nickerson J, Goodman M |year=1992 | title=A molecular perspective on mammalian evolution from the gene encoding interphotoreceptor retinoid binding protein, with convincing evidence for bat monophyly |journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=148–60| doi=10.1016/1055-7903(92)90026-D | pmid=1342928}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other studies have disputed the validity of these conclusions. In particular, it has been argued that [[phylogenies]] based solely on DNA data can be subject to an artifact named the "base-compositional bias" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hutcheon JM, Kirsch JA, Pettigrew JD | year=1998 |title=Base-compositional biases and the bat problem.

This is handled by examining the equation in the [[Completion (ring theory)|completions]] of the [[rational number]]s: the [[real number]]s and the [[p-adic number|''p''-adic numbers]]. A more formal version of the Hasse principle states that certain types of equations have a rational solution [[if and only if]] they have a solution in the [[real number]]s ''and'' in the ''p''-adic numbers for each prime ''p''.

==Intuition==
Given a polynomial equation with rational coefficients, if it has a rational solution, then this also yields a real solution and a ''p''-adic solution, as the rationals embed in the reals and ''p''-adics: a global solution yields local solutions at each prime. The Hasse principle asks when the reverse can be done, or rather, asks what the obstruction is: when can you patch together solutions over the reals and ''p''-adics to yield a solution over the rationals: when can local solutions be joined to form a global solution?

One can ask this for other rings or fields: integers, for instance, or [[number field]]s. For number fields, rather than reals and ''p''-adics, one uses complex embeddings and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak p&lt;/math&gt;-adics, for [[prime ideal]]s &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak p&lt;/math&gt;.

==Forms representing 0==
===Quadratic forms===
The [[Hasse–Minkowski theorem]] states that the local–global principle holds for the problem of [[representing 0]] by [[quadratic form]]s over the [[rational number]]s (which is [[Hermann Minkowski|Minkowski]]'s result); and more generally over any [[number field]] (as proved by Hasse), when one uses all the appropriate [[local field]] necessary conditions. [[Hasse's theorem on cyclic extensions]] states that the local–global principle applies to the condition of being a relative norm for a cyclic extension of number fields.

===Cubic forms===
A counterexample by [[Ernst S. Selmer]] shows that the Hasse–Minkowski theorem cannot be extended to forms of degree 3: The cubic equation 3''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;4''y''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;5''z''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 has a solution in real numbers, and in all p-adic fields, but it has no nontrivial solution in which ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' are all rational numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Ernst S. Selmer | title=The Diophantine equation ''ax''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''by''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''cz''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 | journal=Acta Mathematica | volume=85 | pages=203–362 | year=1951 | doi=10.1007/BF02395746 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Heath-Brown]] showed&lt;ref name=HB&gt;{{cite journal | author=D.R. Heath-Brown | authorlink=Roger Heath-Brown | title=Cubic forms in 14 variables | journal=Invent. Math. | volume=170 | pages=199–230 | year=2007 | doi=10.1007/s00222-007-0062-1| bibcode=2007InMat.170..199H }}&lt;/ref&gt; that every cubic form over the integers in at least 14 variables represents 0, improving on earlier results of [[Harold Davenport|Davenport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=H. Davenport | title=Cubic forms in sixteen variables | journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society A]] | volume=272 | pages=285–303 | year=1963 | doi=10.1098/rspa.1963.0054 | issue=1350 | bibcode=1963RSPSA.272..285D }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since every cubic form over the p-adic numbers with at least ten variables represents 0,&lt;ref name=HB/&gt; the local–global principle holds trivially for cubic forms over the rationals in at least 14 variables.

Restricting to non-singular forms, one can do better than this: Heath-Brown proved that every non-singular cubic form over the rational numbers in at least 10 variables represents 0,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=D. R. Heath-Brown | authorlink=Roger Heath-Brown | title=Cubic forms in ten variables | journal=Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society| volume=47 | pages=225–257 | year=1983 | doi=10.1112/plms/s3-47.2.225 | issue=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; thus trivially establishing the Hasse principle for this class of forms. It is known that Heath-Brown's result is best possible in the sense that there exist non-singular cubic forms over the rationals in 9 variables that don't represent zero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=L. J. Mordell | authorlink=Louis Mordell | title=A remark on indeterminate equations in several variables | journal=Journal of the London Mathematical Society | volume=12 |pages=127–129 | year=1937 | doi=10.1112/jlms/s1-12.1.127 | issue=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Christopher Hooley|Hooley]] showed that the Hasse principle holds for the representation of 0 by non-singular cubic forms over the rational numbers in at least nine variables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=C. Hooley | authorlink=Christopher Hooley | title=On nonary cubic forms | journal=Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik | volume=386 |pages=32–98 | year=1988 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Davenport, Heath-Brown and Hooley all used the [[Hardy–Littlewood circle method]] in their proofs. According to an idea of [[Yuri Ivanovitch Manin|Manin]], the obstructions to the Hasse principle holding for cubic forms can be tied into the theory of the [[Brauer group]]; this is the [[Brauer–Manin obstruction]], which accounts completely for the failure of the Hasse principle for some classes of variety.  However, [[Alexei Skorobogatov|Skorobogatov]] has shown that the Brauer–Manin obstruction cannot explain all the failures of the Hasse principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Alexei N. Skorobogatov | title=Beyond the Manin obstruction | journal=Invent. Math. | volume=135 | issue=2 | pages=399–424 | year=1999 | doi=10.1007/s002220050291 | arxiv=alg-geom/9711006 | bibcode=1999InMat.135..399S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Forms of higher degree===
Counterexamples by [[Masahiko Fujiwara|Fujiwara]] and [[Masaki Sudo|Sudo]] show that the Hasse–Minkowski theorem is not extensible to forms of degree 10''n'' + 5, where ''n'' is a non-negative integer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=M. Fujiwara | authorlink=Masahiko Fujiwara |author2=M. Sudo |authorlink2=Masaki Sudo  | title=Some forms of odd degree for which the Hasse principle fails | journal=Pacific Journal of Mathematics | volume=67 | year=1976 | issue=1 | pages=161–169 | doi=10.2140/pjm.1976.67.161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, [[Birch's theorem]] shows that if ''d'' is any odd natural number, then there is a number ''N''(''d'') such that any form of degree ''d'' in more than ''N''(''d'') variables represents 0: the Hasse principle holds trivially.

==Albert–Brauer–Hasse–Noether theorem==
The [[Albert–Brauer–Hasse–Noether theorem]] establishes a local–global principle for the splitting of a [[central simple algebra]] ''A'' over an algebraic number field ''K''.  It states that if ''A'' splits over every [[local field|completion]] ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''v''&lt;/sub&gt; then it is isomorphic to a [[matrix ring|matrix algebra]] over ''K''.

==Hasse principle for algebraic groups==

The Hasse principle for algebraic groups states that if ''G'' is a simply-connected algebraic group defined over the global field ''k'' then the map from
:&lt;math&gt; H^1(k,G)\rightarrow\prod_s H^1(k_s,G)&lt;/math&gt;
is injective, where the product is over all places ''s'' of ''k''.

The Hasse principle for orthogonal groups is closely related to the Hasse principle for the corresponding quadratic forms.

{{harvtxt|Kneser|1966}} and several others verified the Hasse principle by case-by-case proofs for each group. The last case was the group ''E''&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; which was only completed by {{harvtxt|Chernousov|1989}} many years after the other cases.

The Hasse principle for algebraic groups was used in the proofs of the [[Weil conjecture for Tamagawa numbers]] and the [[strong approximation theorem]].

==Dilemma of Balaki==

Proud Balaki skilled in expounding, eloquent, went to Ajatsatru, the King of [[Benares]], to impart superior wisdom to him which he knew only as the conditioned [[Brahman]]; he knew about the physical and physiological categories and therefore, the king soon realized that Balaki did not know about Brahman. Balaki was not aware of the fact that whatever he knew was the result of [[Avidya (Hinduism)|ignorance]], that the results of ignorance, being finite things, are separated from him. Ajatsatru then tells Balaki Gargya that reality is to be found in the deep-sleep-consciousness. [[Pippalada]], the sage of the [[Prashna Upanishad]], holds that sleep is caused by the senses being absorbed in that highest 'sensorium' the mind, which is why in deep sleep man is not able to hear, not to see, nor to smell because the mind is then merged into an ocean of light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Constructive Survey of Upanishadic Philosophy 1986 Ed.|author=R.D.Ranade|publisher=Bhartiya Vidya Bhavan|page=33,89,185|url= http://www.worldcat.org/title/constructive-survey-of-upanishadic-philosophy-being-an-introduction-to-the-thought-of-the-upanishads/oclc/799119712}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Doctrine of deep-sleep-consciousness==

[[Adi Sankara|Sankara]] explains that Balaki knew only about those phases of Brahman that consist of name, form and action which have to be known in the sphere of [[Avidya (Hinduism)|ignorance]]. Therefore, in the context of deep-sleep-consciousness, Ajatsatru reiterates that the being full of consciousness in sleep absorbs the functions of the organs through its own consciousness and lies in [[Akasha]] that is in the heart. The heart is the seat of the intellect, the internal organ, and the other or external organs are subject to that intellect abiding in the heart. What is seen in a dream are not the attributes of the self. That conscious being, who has identified itself with action, its factors and its results due to the limitations of name and form and is superimposed by ignorance, virtually comes back to the body in the manner described in the [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]]:-

:अथ यदा सुषुप्तो भवति, यदा न कस्यचन वेद, हिता नाडयो द्वासप्ततिः सहस्त्राणि ह्र्द्यत्पुरिततमभिप्रतिष्ठन्ते, 
:ताभिः प्रत्यवसृप्य पुरीतति शेते; स यथा कुमारो वा महाराजो वा महाब्राह्मणो वाति ध्नीमानन्दस्य गत्वा शयीत, एवमेवैष एतच्छेते ||२.१.१९||

:"Again when it becomes fast asleep – when it does not know anything – it comes back along the seventy-two thousand nerves called ''Hitā'', which extend from the heart to the pericardium (the whole body), and remains in the body. As a baby, or an emperor, or a noble Brahmana lives, having attained the acme of bliss, so does it remain." – ([[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] II.i.19)

:…अस्यैता हिता नाम नाडयोऽन्तर्ह्रदये प्रतिष्ठिता भवन्ति, एताभिर्वा एतदास्त्रवतिः तस्मादेष प्रविविक्ताहारतर इवैव भवत्यस्माच्छारिरादत्मनः ||४.२.३||

:".. In this body there are nerves called ''Hitā'', which are placed in the heart. Through these the essence of our food passes at it moves on. Therefore the subtle body has finer food than the gross body." – ([[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] II.i.19)

:ता व अस्यैता हिता नाम नाडयो यथा केशः सहस्त्रधा भिन्नस्तावताणिम्ना तिष्ठन्ति, शुक्लस्य नीलस्य पिङ्गलस्य हरितस्य लोहितस्य पूर्णा;....||४.३.२०||

:"In him are those nerves called ''Hitā'', which are as fine as a hair split into a thousand parts, and filled with white, blue, brown, green and red (serums). (They are the seat of the subtle body in which impressions are stored)…" – ([[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] II.i.19)

The experience of the waking state is seen in dreams. The [[Taijasa]] is nourished by finer food than the [[Vaisvanara]]. And, ignorance is not the natural characteristic of the self. All impressions due to the experience of high and low attributes of the relative universe are centred in the subtle body where they are stored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Brihadaranyaka Upanishad|publisher=Advaita Ashrama|page=198,412,457|url= http://www.chennaimath.org/istore/product/the-brihadaranyaka-upanishad-madhavananda/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implication==

[[Swami Nikhilananda]] explains that the self that functions in the 'waking state' is [[Vaisvanara]], which in the 'dream state' is [[Taijasa]] and in the 'dreamless-sleep state', ''Prajna''; [[Viraj]] (matter) unites with this self identified with [[Indra]] in dreams when there is no distinction between the experiencer and the object of experience. In deep sleep the [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]], limited by ''[[Prana]] '' or vital breath, is called ''[[Prajna (Vedic)|Prajna]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Principal Upanishads|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|page=225|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BQxXk7pAx0cC&amp;pg=PA225&amp;dq=hita+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VH8aU7rFM4eYrAfi3oCwCw&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=hita%20upanishads&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subtle body in which the impressions that are stored in the body owing to the contact with the serums filled in the ''Hitā'' undergoes modifications under the influence of past merit and demerit, and in dreams falsely manifests itself as impressions in a variety of forms. When ignorance is eliminated and knowledge reaches its perfection, the state of identity with all ('[[Moksha|liberation]]') is attained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Brihadaranyaka Upanishad|publisher=Advaita Ashrama|pages=457–459|url= http://www.chennaimath.org/istore/product/the-brihadaranyaka-upanishad-madhavananda/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37709">[[File:Hausnummer in Deutschland (2004-01-28).jpeg|thumb|A house number in [[Germany]].]]
'''House numbering''' is the system of giving a unique [[number]] to each [[building]] in a [[street]] or [[Area (country subdivision)|area]], with the intention of making it easier to locate a particular building. The house number is often part of a [[Address (geography)|postal address]]. The term describes the number of any building (residential or not) with a mailbox, or even a [[land lot|vacant lot]].

House numbering schemes vary by location, and in many cases even within cities. In some areas of the world, including many remote areas, houses are named but are not assigned numbers.

== History ==
[[File:Goodman's Field.jpg|thumb|upright|One of the earliest street numbering systems was introduced along Prescott Street in Goodman's Field, London. [[John Rocque's Map of London, 1746]].]]
A house numbering scheme was present in [[Pont Notre-Dame]] in [[Paris]] in 1512.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1898/07/16/102074964.pdf |title=The Numbering of Houses |date=16 July 1898 |work=The New York Times|access-date = 27 September 2015 |publisher=Adolph Ochs}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the purpose of the numbering was generally to determine the distribution of property ownership in the city, rather than for the purpose of organization.{{Citation needed|date = September 2015}}

In the 18th century the first street numbering schemes were applied across Europe, to aid in administrative tasks and the provision of services such as [[Mail|mail delivery]]. The ''New View of [[London]]'' reported in 1708 that "at Prescott Street, Goodman's Fields, instead of signs, the houses are distinguished by numbers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DyZfYaLXsuUC |title=London: A Social History |author=Roy Porter |year=1998 |publisher=Harvard University Press |page=126|isbn=978-0-674-53839-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Parts of the Paris [[suburb]]s were numbered in the 1720s; the houses in the Jewish quarter in the city of [[Prague]] in the [[Austrian Empire]] were numbered in the same decade to aid the authorities in the [[conscription]] of the [[History of the Jews in Prague|Jews]].{{Citation needed|date = September 2015}}

Street numbering took off in the mid 18th century, especially in [[Prussia]], where authorities were ordered to "fix numbers on the houses ... in little villages on the day before the troops march in". In the 1750s and 60s, street numbering on a large scale was applied in [[Madrid]], London, Paris, and [[Vienna]], as well as many other cities across [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://histoiremesure.revues.org/3942?lang=en |title=Addressing the Houses: The Introduction of House Numbering in Europe |accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 March 1768, [[Louis XV of France|King Louis XV of France]] decreed that all French houses outside of Paris affix house numbers, primarily for tracking troops quartered in civilian homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Indexing the great ledger of the community: urban house numbering, city directories, and the production of spatial legibility |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305748807000709 |journal=Journal of Historical Geography |date=1 April 2008 |pages=286–310 |volume=34 |issue=2 |doi=10.1016/j.jhg.2007.06.003 |first=Reuben S. |last=Rose-Redwood}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Critical Toponymies: The Contested Politics of Place Naming |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xg1GAepFft8C |publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. |isbn=978-0-7546-7453-5 |first=Reuben |last=Rose-Redwood |year=2009|editor-last = Berg|editor-first = Lawrence D.|editor-last2 = Vuolteenaho|editor-first2 = Jani |chapter=Indexing the Great Ledger of the Community: Urban House Numbering, City Directories, and the Production of Spatial Legibility |page=199|access-date = 26 September 2015|orig-year = originally published in 2008 in ''Journal of Historical Geography'' but revised in 2009|chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xg1GAepFft8C&amp;pg=PA199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number 5 means that the property is between {{convert|40|to(-)|60|m}} from the datum point of the road, and is on the left hand side of the road as viewed from the datum point.]]
In [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], the current standard (Australia/New Zealand joint standard AS/NZS 4819:2011 - Rural &amp; Urban Addressing)&lt;ref&gt;https://infostore.saiglobal.com/store/details.aspx?ProductID=1497944&lt;/ref&gt; is directed at local governments that have the primary responsibility for addressing and road naming. The standard calls for lots and buildings on newly created streets to be assigned odd numbers (on the left) and even numbers (on the right) when facing in the direction of increasing numbers (the European system) reflecting already common practice. It first came into force in 2003 under AS/NZS 4819:2003 - Geographic Information – Rural &amp; Urban Addressing.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.icsm.gov.au/street/&lt;/ref&gt; Exceptions are where the road forms part of the boundary between different council areas or cities. For example, Underwood Road in [[Rochedale South]], divided between [[Logan City]] and the [[City of Brisbane]].

In [[New South Wales]], the vast majority of streets were numbered before 2003, some with odd numbers assigned to houses on the right of the street when facing the direction along which numbers increase. There is no plan to reassign these numbers.

On some long urban roads (e.g. [[Parramatta Road]] in Sydney) numbers ascend until the road crosses a council or suburb boundary, then start again at 1 or 2, where a street sign gives the name of the relevant area &amp;mdash; these streets have repeating numbers. In semi-rural and rural areas, where houses and farms are widely spaced, a numbering system based on tens of metres or (less commonly) metres has been devised. Thus a farm {{convert|2300|m}} from the start of the road, on the right-hand side would be numbered 230.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icsm.gov.au/icsm/street/index.html "Street Addressing Working Group and the National Street Addressing Standard"]. ''Intergovernmental Committee on Survey and Mapping''. March 19, 2008. Retrieved February 24, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ballarat]] Central, Victoria uses the US system of increasing house numbers by 100 after a major cross street. Streets are designated North or South depending upon their relative position to Sturt Street.

In Japan and South Korea, a city is divided into small numbered zones. The houses within each zone are then labelled in the order in which they were constructed, or clockwise around the block. This system is comparable to the system of [[sestiere|sestieri]] (''sixths'') used in [[Venice]]. Visitors to a large, complex city like [[Tokyo]] often must resort to asking for directions at a [[Kōban|local police substation]].

In [[Hong Kong]], a former [[British colony]], the British and European norm to number houses on one side of the street with odd numbers, and the other side with even numbers, is generally followed. Some roads or streets along the coastline may however have numbering only on one side, even if the opposite side is later [[land reclamation|reclaimed]]. These roads or streets include [[Ferry Street, Hong Kong|Ferry Street]], [[Connaught Road West]], and [[Gloucester Road, Hong Kong|Gloucester Road]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hk-place.com/db.php?post=d006043]&lt;/ref&gt;

Most [[PRC|mainland Chinese]] cities use the European system, with odd numbers on one side of the road and even numbers on the opposite side. In high-density old Shanghai, a street number may be either a ''hao'' ("号" hào) or ''nong'' ("弄" nòng/lòng), both of them being numbered successively. A ''hao'' refers a door rather than a building, for example, if a building with the address 25 Wuming Rd is followed by another building, which has three entrances opening to the street, the latter will be numbered as three different ''hao'', from 27 to 29 Wuming Rd.

A ''nong'', sometimes translated as "lane", refers to a block of buildings. So if in the above example the last building is followed by an enclosed compound, it will have the address "lane 31, Wuming Rd". A ''nong'' is further subdivided in its own ''hao'', which do not correlate with the ''hao'' of the street, so the full address of an apartment within a compound may look like "Apartment 5005, no. 7, lane 31, Wuming Rd".

== Southeast Asia ==
The most common street address formats in [[Vietnam]] are:

* A number followed by the street name, for example "{{lang|vi|123 đường Lê Lợi|italic=no}}". This is the most basic, most common format.
* A number with an alphabetic suffix: "{{lang|vi|123A đường Lê Lợi|italic=no}}", "{{lang|vi|123B đường Lê Lợi|italic=no}}", etc. This format occurs when a property is numbered 123 but later subdivided into two houses with different addresses.
* If the house lies on an alley, the alley number is combined with the house number: for example, in "{{lang|vi|123/3 đường Lê Lợi|italic=no}}", 123 is the alley's address, and 3 is the house number on that alley.
* More complex house numbers may occur on alleys that branch from other alleys or properties on alleys are subdivided, for example "{{lang|vi|123/3E đường Lê Lợi|italic=no}}" or "{{lang|vi|123/3/5B đường Lê Lợi|italic=no}}". An extreme example would be "{{lang|vi|7/14/12/3/23a đường 182|italic=no}}", which is located on 3rd alley off 12th alley off 14th alley off 7th alley off 182nd street.

Another scheme is based on residential areas called {{lang|vi|cư xá}}. A {{lang|vi|cư xá}} is addressed by house number, road, and {{lang|vi|cư xá}}, for example "{{lang|vi|123 đường số 4 cư xá Bình Thới|italic=no}}". Some localities still use an older address format based on neighborhood ({{lang|vi|khu}}): for example, in "{{lang|vi|7A/34 Tô Hiến Thành|italic=no}}", 7A is the neighborhood number. This confusing format is being gradually phased out in favor of the more modern formats above.

== West Asia ==

Generally in [[Iran]] and especially in the capital [[Tehran]] odd numbers are all on one side and the even numbers opposite along streets. Infrequently, this style confuses people because this is not how it works everywhere in the city and sometimes the numbers get intertwined with each other. In the rural parts, some houses have no number at all and some have their owner's details as the number instead. In some cases, using the number 13 is skipped replacing it with equivalents such as: 12+1 or 14-1

== Northern and Western Europe ==
[[File:House numbers odd and even.svg|thumb|European scheme]]
In Europe the most common house numbering scheme, in this article referred to as the "European" scheme, is to number each plot on one side of the road with ascending [[odd number]]s, from 1, and those on the other with ascending [[even number]]s, from 2 (or sometimes 0). The odd numbers are usually on the left side of the road, looking in the direction in which the numbers increase.

Where additional buildings are inserted or subdivided, these are often suffixed a, b, c, etc. (in Spain and France,  ''[[wikt:bis#Latin|bis]]'', ''[[wikt:ter#Latin|ter]]'', ''quater'').  Where buildings are later combined, they may use just one of the original numbers, combine them ("13/15"), or give their address as a range (e.g. "13–17"; not to be construed as including the even numbers 14 and 16). Buildings with multiple entrances may have a single number for the entire building or a separate number for each entrance.

Where plots are not built upon gaps may be left in the numbering scheme or marked on maps for the plots. If buildings are added to a stretch of old street the following may be used rather than a long series of suffixes to the existing numbers: a new name for a new estate/block along the street (e.g. ''1-100 Waterloo Place/Platz, Sud St.''.); a new road name inserted along the course of a street either with or without mention of the parent street; unused numbers ''above'' the highest house number may be used (although rarely as this introduces confusing discontinuity), or the upper remainder of the street is renumbered.

Other local numbering schemes are also in use for administrative or historic reasons, including clockwise and anti-clockwise numbering, district-based numbering, distance-based numbering, and double numbering.

=== Finland ===
The Finnish numbering system incorporates solutions to the problems which arose with mass [[urbanization]] and increase in building density.  Addresses always are formatted as street name followed by street address number.  With new, [[infill]] building, new addresses are created by adding letters representing the new ground level access point within the old street address, and if there are more apartments than ground level access points, a number added for the apartment number within the new development. The original street numbering system followed the pattern of odd numbers on one side and even numbers on the other side of the street, with lower numbers towards the center of town and higher numbers further away from the center.

The infill numbering system avoids renumbering the entire street when developments are modified. For example, Mannerheimintie 5 (a large mansion house on a large city plot) was demolished and replaced with 4 new buildings each with 2 stairwells all accessible from Mannerheimintie. The 8 new access stairwells are labelled A B C D E F G and H (each with the letter visible above the stairwell). Each stairwell has 4 apartments on 5 floors, so the new development has 160 new addresses in all running from Mannerheimintie 5 A 1 through to Mannerheimintie 5 H 160.  The opposite example is where old, narrow buildings have been combined; Iso Roobertinkatu 36, 38 and 40 were demolished in the 1920s and the new building has the address Iso Roobertinkatu 36-40.

In the rural parts of Finland, a variant of this method is used. As in towns, odd and even numbers are on opposite sides of the road, but many numbers are skipped. Instead, the house number indicates the distance in tens of metres from the start of the road. For example, "Pengertie 159" would be 1590 metres from the place where Pengertie starts.

=== Netherlands ===
When more buildings are constructed than numbers were originally allotted, discontinuity of numbering is avoided by giving multiple adjacent buildings the same number, with a letter suffix starting at "A". In [[Haarlem]], [[Netherlands]], red numbers are used for upstairs apartments.

=== Portugal ===
In [[Portugal]], the European scheme is most commonly used. However, in [[Porto]] and several other cities in the Portuguese [[Northern Portugal|Northern region]], as well as in the [[Cascais]] Municipality (near [[Lisbon]]), houses are numbered in the North American style, with the number assigned being proportional to the distance in [[meter]]s from the baseline of the street.

[[Lisbon]] numbering is European and furthermore 'from the river, odd numbers left'. Because the [[Tagus]] borders Lisbon on the south and the east, this means that north-south streets are numbered low from the south, and east-west streets are numbered low from the east.

In many new planned neighborhoods of Portugal houses and other buildings are identified by a ''lote'' (plot) number without reference to their street. This is in law the ''número de polícia'', which literally means ''police's number'' &amp;mdash; the police formerly assigned the numbers rather than the town hall. The ''lote'' is the construction plot number used in the [[urban plan]], a consecutive number series applies to a broad neighborhood. In theory and in most cases, the use of a ''lote'' number system is provisional, being replaced by a traditional street number system some time after the neighborhood is built and inhabited. In some neighborhoods, ''lote'' numbers are kept for many years, some never being replaced by street numbers.

The relatively new planned neighborhood of [[Parque das Nações]] in Lisbon has also a different numbering scheme: each building is referred by its plot, parcel, and building (in Portuguese: ''lote'', ''parcela'', ''prédio''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.publico.pt/2012/11/22/local/noticia/caiu-o-muro-que-dividia-o-parque-das-nacoes-1573465&lt;/ref&gt;).

=== United Kingdom ===
[[File:House numbers clockwise.jpg|thumb|Clockwise scheme. A similar, counter-clockwise scheme also remains in use in parts of Germany.]]
The European system is most widely used.  The odd numbers will typically be on the left-hand side as seen from the centre of the town or village, with the lowest numbers at the end of the street closest to the town centre. Intermediate properties usually have a number suffixed A, B, C, etc., much more rarely instead being given a half number, e.g. the old police station at {{frac|20|1|2}} Camberwell Church Street. It is extremely rare for a property (built next to no. 2 after the street had been numbered) to be zero (0) or named Minusone; researchers have found these instances once in [[Middlesbrough]] and once in [[Newbury, Berkshire|Newbury]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mjt.me.uk/posts/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-addresses/&lt;/ref&gt;  In many rural streets, significantly built alongside before 1900, houses remain named (unnumbered).

In some places, particularly when open land, a river or a large church fronts one side, all plots on one side of a street are numbered consecutively. Such a street if modern and long is more likely to be numbered using odd numbers, starting at 1.  Along oldest streets, numbering is usually clockwise and consecutive: for example in [[Pall Mall, London|Pall Mall]], some [[New towns in the United Kingdom|new towns]], and in many villages in [[Wales]]. This usually also applies to all [[cul de sac|culs-de-sac]]s. For instance, [[10 Downing Street]], the official home of the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], is next door to [[11 Downing Street]].  Houses which surround squares are usually numbered consecutively clockwise.

In the early/mid 19th century numbering of long urban streets commonly changed (from clockwise, strict consecutive to odds (consecutive) which face evens (consecutive)). Where this took place it presents a street-long pitfall to researchers using historic [[Kelly's directory|street directories]] and other records. A very rare variation may be seen where a [[high street]] (main street) continues from a less commercial part &amp;mdash; a road which breaks the UK conventions by not starting at 1 or 2. On one side of the main road between Stratford and Leytonstone houses up to no. 122 are "Leytonstone Road". The next house is "124 High Road, Leytonstone".

Developers may avoid the number 13 for house numbering as in [[Iran]], because that number is [[Triskaidekaphobia|considered by some to be unlucky]].&lt;ref&gt;Bowlby, Chris. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/7779212.stm "Would you buy a number 13 house?"]. BBC News. December 12, 2008. Retrieved February 24, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Blocks of flats (apartments) are treated in two ways:
*Flats numbered individually as part of the street. A lintel will typically be embossed or metalled "1-24 Acacia Avenue" or "Flats 1-24 Acacia Avenue".
*Flats numbered by building. The building retains its own number on the street e.g. "Flat 24, 1 Acacia Avenue" or increasingly as commonly: "Apartment 1-X, 1 Acacia Avenue" or by floor: "Apartment 9D, 1 Acacia Avenue". Outside the number of flats is discreetly shown or not revealed.

In the UK street numbering and street signposts vary across local authorities.  Numbering plates (or similar) are overwhelmingly at the discretion of house owners.

===Marking of numbers===
In the UK [[fanlight]]s in front doors were introduced in the 1720s in which the house number may be engraved.&lt;ref&gt;The Fanlight Number Company, July 19, 2009. http://www.fanlightnumbers.co.uk/history.html&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary architecture and modern house building techniques see alternatively acrylic, aluminium, or glass, ceramic, brass, slate, or stone used.

==Southern Europe==
=== Italy ===
Italy mostly follows the European scheme described above but there are some exceptions, generally for historical reasons.

In [[Venice]], houses are numbered within six named series (one per ''[[sestiere (Venice)|sestiere]]'' district). Similarly, small villages in rural areas may also occasionally use a single progressive series for all house numbers.&lt;ref&gt;Example of house numbers in Sistiana, Italy [http://ilpiccolo.gelocal.it/trieste/cronaca/2014/01/20/news/portopiccolo-ha-gia-il-suo-indirizzo-sistiana-231-per-le-case-negozi-al-232-1.8508788 "Portopiccolo ha già il suo indirizzo: Sistiana 231 per le case, negozi al 232"]. ''Il Piccolo''. January 20, 2014. Retrieved September 23, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Genoa]], [[Savona]] and [[Florence]] houses are marked with black (sometimes blue in Florence) numbers; businesses are usually (but not always) given red numbers, giving up to two distinct, numerically overlapping series per street. Those of businesses are denoted in all other writing (documents, online directories, etc.) by the addition of the letter "r" (e.g. "Via dei Servi 21r").

=== Turkey ===
In most of Turkey, currently the European house numbering scheme is applied. The [[Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality]] introduced new house numbering and street signs in 2007 by two official designers.&lt;ref name="Hürriyet"&gt;[http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/cumartesi/6718942.asp], Istanbul's red signs. (Turkish)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Central and Eastern Europe ==
In [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]], with some exceptions, houses are typically numbered in the European style. Many streets, however, use the "[[boustrophedon]]" system.{{explain|date=March 2017}}

=== Austria ===
A double numbering system has been used, similar to the system in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, which also were formerly parts of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]].

=== Czech Republic and Slovakia ===
[[File:House numbers Prague map.jpg|thumb|upright=2.5|Map of house numbering in the Prague district of Vyšehrad]]
In some [[Czech Republic|Czech]] and [[Slovakia|Slovak]] cities and settlements, two numbering systems are used concurrently.

The basic house number is the "old" or "conscription number" ([[Czech language|Czech]]: ''popisné číslo'', [[Slovak language|Slovak]]: ''súpisné číslo''). The conscription number is unique within the municipal part (a village, a quarter, mostly for one cadastral area) or within a whole small municipality.

For makeshift and recreational buildings in the Czech Republic, "registration number" (''evidenční číslo'') from a separate number series is used instead of the descriptive number. Typically, this number begins with zero or with the letter "E", or has different colour, or contains words like ''nouzová stavba'' ("makeshift structure") or ''chata'' ("weekend house"), etc.

In some settlements where streets have names (mostly in cities), "new" or "orientational numbers" (Czech: ''orientační číslo'', Slovak: ''orientačné číslo'') are also used concurrently. The orientational numbers are arranged sequentially within the street or square. If the building is on a corner or has two sides, it can have two or more orientation numbers, one for each of the adjacent streets or squares. Solitary houses distant from named streets often have no orientation number. In some places, the name of a small quarter is used instead of a street name. If there is a new building between two older numbered ones, the orientation number is distinguished with an additional lower case letter (for example, the sequence could be 5, 7, 9, 9a, 9b, 9c, 11, 13).  In the 1930–1950s in [[Brno]], lower case letters were used for separate entrances of modern block houses perpendicular to the street.

Either number may be used in addresses. Sometimes, businesses will use both numbers to avoid confusion, usually putting the descriptive (or registration) number first: "Hlavní 20/7". The two (or three) types of numbers are commonly distinguished by colour of the sign. Each municipality can have its own traditional or official rules and colours. In [[Prague]] and many other [[Bohemia]]n cities, descriptive numbers are red, orientation numbers are blue and "evidential" numbers are green or yellow or red. In many Bohemian municipalities, descriptive numbers are blue, black, or are not unified. In Brno and some Moravian and Slovak cities, descriptive numbers are white-black signs, orientation numbers are red-white signs. Many cities and municipalities have different rules.

Formerly, Roman numerals signifying the city district were added to the conscription number: e.g. "125/III" means conscription number 125 in district number III (in [[Prague]], this was [[Malá Strana]]). Roman numerals were used both in cities and in village municipalities with more settlements. Nowadays, the name of the settlement is preferred instead of Roman numerals.

The first conscription numbering was ordered by [[Maria Theresa]] in 1770 and implemented in 1770–1771. The series was given successively as the soldiers went through the settlement describing houses with numbers. Thereafter, every new house was allocated the next number sequentially, irrespective of its location. Most villages still use their original number series from 1770–1771. In cities, houses have been renumbered once or more often in order to be sequential{{spnd}}the first wave of renumbering came in 1805–1815. In 1857, the Austrian Emperor allowed a new system of numbering by streets. This new system was introduced in the biggest cities (Prague, Brno) in the 1860s. In 1884, land registration books were introduced and they used the old (conscription) numbers as a permanent and stable identifier of buildings. The new (orientation) numbers continue to be used concurrently.

=== Germany ===
In Germany, the European scheme (ascending odd/even numbers, see above) is usually used. In most cases, the numbers increase in the direction away from the town/city centre. Some places use a clockwise scheme for historical reasons, called ''Hufeisennummerierung'' ("horseshoe numbering") due to the progression of the numbers. This includes [[Berlin]], parts of [[Hamburg]] and some other towns in northern Germany.

In some older streets in northern and eastern Germany, mainly in the former [[Kingdom of Prussia]] and adjoining areas, including parts of [[Berlin]] and [[Hamburg]], the "horseshoe" numbering system (counter-clockwise "boustrophedon"-style numbering) was used for the numbering of new streets up until the 1920s, after which the European system was introduced for new streets.

Under the horseshoe numbering scheme, starting from one end, the buildings on the right side of the street were numbered sequentially from the near end to the far end of the street. The next number was then assigned to the last building on the left, opposite side of the street, the following numbers sequentially doubling back along the left side of the street.  The building with the highest number would be the first on the left side, facing building number 1 across the street. The horseshoe numbering system remains in use in older streets in many German cities, notably Berlin, although newer adjoining streets may use modern European numbering. [[Kurfürstendamm]] in Berlin is a well-known example of a street where the horseshoe numbering scheme is still in use, although the numbering today starts with 11 at [[Breitscheidplatz]], with number 237 across the street being the highest number.&lt;ref name=Wittstock&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wittstock |first1=Bernhard |title=Ziffer Zahl Ordnung. Die Berliner Hausnummer von den Anfängen Ende des 18. Jahrhunderts bis zur Gegenwart im deutschen und europäischen Kontext. |date=2011 |publisher=Berlin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Very small villages sometimes number all buildings in the village sequentially according to their date of construction, and independent of the street they are on.  However, this scheme is being phased out because it makes it hard to find a building by its address.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Drochtersen hat ein Problem: Das große Durcheinander mit den Hausnummern|url=http://www.abendblatt.de/region/stade/article107538081/Das-grosse-Durcheinander-mit-den-Hausnummern.html|publisher=Hamburger Abendblatt|accessdate=13 January 2017|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Former Soviet Union ===
In [[Russia]] and many other former [[USSR]] countries, the European style is generally used, with numbers starting from the end of the street closest to the town center. Buildings or plots at street intersections may be assigned a composite number, which includes the number along the intersecting street separated by a slash ({{lang-ru|дробь}}), like in Нахимова, 14/41 (14 is the number along Nakhimova street and 41 is the number along intersecting street).

The odd numbers are usually on the left side of the road, looking in the direction in which the numbers increase; though in some cities (including [[Saint Petersburg]]) the odd numbers are on the right side. Some cities (for example, [[Nizhniy Novgorod]]) have mixed numbering: odd numbers on the right in some parts of the city and on the left in others.

Soviet era housing districts ([[microdistrict]]s) often have a complicated network of access lanes thought too small to merit their own names. Buildings in these lanes are ascribed to larger streets which may be quite far from their location; a building placed along a street may sometimes be ascribed to another street, which sometimes makes finding a building by its address a challenging task.

In some cities, especially hosting large scientific or military research centers in Soviet time, the numbering might be different: houses may have numbers related to the block rather than the street, thus 12-й квартал, дом 3 (Block 12, House 3),&lt;ref name=dxdy&gt;[http://dxdy.ru/topic3547.html Related discussion], additional text.&lt;/ref&gt; similar to the Japanese and Korean systems (see below). [[Aktau]] is one example of this.

When a numbered plot contains multiple buildings, they are assigned an additional component of the street address, called корпус (building), which is usually a sequentially assigned number unique within the plot (but sometimes contains letters as in 15а, 15б, 15в and so on). So, a Russian street address may look like Московское шоссе, дом 23, корпус 2 (Moscow Street, plot 23, building 2), or Льва Толстого, дом 14б (Leo Tolstoy Street, plot 14, building b).

On very long roads in suburban areas, a kilometer numbering system also may be used (like Australian rural numbering system). For example, 9-й км Воткинского шоссе (9th kilometer of Votkinsk Highway), and Шабердинский тракт, 7-й км (7th kilometer of Shaberdy Road).

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Latin America ==
[[File:House numbers meters.jpg|thumb|Distance scheme]]
In Latin America, some countries, like Mexico and Uruguay, use systems similar to those in Europe. Houses are numbered in ascending order from downtown to the border of the city. In Mexico, the cities are usually divided in ''Colonias'', which are small or medium areas. The ''colonia'' is commonly included in the address before the postal code. Sometimes when houses merge in a street or new constructions are built after the numbering was made, the address can become ambiguous. When a number is re-used, a letter is added for the newer address. For example, if there are two 35s, one remains as "35", and the second one becomes "35A" or "35[[wikt:Bis#Latin|Bis]]".

It is sometimes common in remote towns or non-planned areas inside the cities, that the streets do not have any name and the houses do not have numbers. In these cases, the address of the houses are usually the name of a person or family, the name of the area or town, or ''Dirección Conocida'' ("known address"), which means that the house of the family is known by almost all the community. This kind of addressing is only used in remote towns or small communities near highways. For people living near highways or roads, the usual address is the kilometer distance of the road in which the house is established; if there is more than one address, some references might be written or the ''Dirección Conocida'' may be added.

In Uruguay, most house numbering starts at a high number among the hundreds or the thousands. The system is similar to the French-Spanish one: when a house is divided the term 'bis' is added with the difference that no single term designates the third: when a house is divided or added between another the term 'bis' is repeated as many divisions have been made or houses added in between, for example '3217 bis bis' corresponds to the third house from the 3217th, and so on, when many houses are merged the lowest number is used, leaving the in-between numbers missing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Caravia|first1=Antonio|title=Colección de leyes, decretos y resoluciones gubernativas, tratados tratados internacionales, acuerdos del Tribunal de apelaciones y disposiciones de carácter permanente de la República Oriental del Uruguay|date=1867|publisher=Imp. a vapor de LA TRIBUNA|location=Montevideo|page=278|edition=HARVARD COLLEGE LIBRARY DEC 24 1915 LATIN AMERICAN PROFESSORSHIP FUND.|url=https://books.google.com.uy/books?id=pwIDAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA278&amp;dq=numeracion+de+puerta+montevideo&amp;hl=es-419&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjt6d6co__SAhXCg5AKHWWnD0EQ6AEIHzAB|accessdate=30 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also there are cases when no number is assigned, this occurs mostly in peripheral areas inside the cities, low house numbering occurs in small locations and in balneary areas houses are designated by name rather than number.

In countries like [[Brazil]] and [[Argentina]], a scheme is used also for streets in cities, where the house number is the distance measured in meters from the house to the start of the street. In [[Venezuela]], houses, buildings,  and streets have names instead of numbers.

[[File:Hamilton County Street Address map.png|thumb|House numbers in [[Hamilton County, Ohio]], have a clear spatial pattern; lower in Downtown [[Cincinnati]] and progressively higher further out in the suburbs]]

In the United States and Canada, streets are usually numbered with odd on one side and even on the other.  The specific ordering of the numbers vary based on the policies of the local municipality.  Generally, three different systems exist:

*Streets may be numbered strictly sequentially, starting with 1 at the start of the street, and continuing in order skipping no numbers until the end.  In these cases, if additional addresses are needed to be assigned to new buildings, fractional house numbers may be used, or letter suffixes may be appended to the house number.

*Streets may be numbered from the most recent intersection.  In these cases, numbers progress sequentially from each intersection, but skip to the next set of numbers at each cross street, usually in sets of even 100s.  Thus, the first [[city block|block]] on a street may start at 1, and continue up until the next block, when they start at 101, then 201, and so on.

*Streets may be numbered based on distances, where the house number is based on some mathematical formula according to the distance from the start of the numbering system.

Even within these systems, there is are also two ways to define the starting point for the numbering system.  Some places will start the numbering system at the start of the street itself.  Other places will define a numbering system based on a defined point or line, such as a municipal or county boundary, or a defined intersection near the center of the municipality, with numbers increasing generally as one gets further from the baseline, regardless of where streets start or stop.

'''Inherent jurisdiction''' is a doctrine of the [[England|English]] [[common law]] that a [[superior court]] has the [[jurisdiction]] to hear any matter that comes before it, unless a [[statute]] or rule limits that authority or grants [[exclusive jurisdiction]] to some other court or [[tribunal]]. The term is also used when a governmental institution derives its jurisdiction from a fundamental governing instrument such as a [[constitution]]. In the English case of ''Bremer Vulkan Schiffbau und Maschinenfabrik v. South India Shipping Corporation Ltd'', [[Lord Diplock]] described the court's inherent jurisdiction as a general power to control its own procedure so as to prevent its being used to achieve injustice. 

Inherent jurisdiction appears to apply to an almost limitless set of circumstances. There are four general categories for use of the court's inherent jurisdiction:

#to ensure convenience and fairness in legal proceedings;
#to prevent steps being taken that would render judicial proceedings inefficacious;
#to prevent abuses of process;
#to act in aid of superior courts and in aid or control of inferior courts and tribunals.

As such, the exercise of inherent jurisdiction is a broad doctrine allowing a court to control its own processes and to control the procedures before it. The power stems not from any particular statute or legislation, but rather from inherent powers invested in a court to control the proceedings brought before it.

==Inherent jurisdiction in Canada==
According to the [[case law]] in [[Canada]], the key restriction on the application of inherent jurisdiction is that the [[doctrine]] cannot be used to [[override power|override]] an existing [[statute]] or [[Procedural law|rule]]. The clearest articulation of such restriction is set out in the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] decision in ''[http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1975/1975canlii164/1975canlii164.html College Housing Co-operative Ltd. v Baxter Student Housing Ltd. (1976)]'' which was a case dealing with whether a judge had exceeded jurisdiction in determining the [[mortgagee]] should have priority over other charges and encumbrances. The Supreme Court of Canada stated that a court cannot negate the unambiguous expression of legislative will and further held that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Inherent jurisdiction cannot, of course, be exercised so as to conflict with statute or rule. Moreover, because it is a special and extraordinary power, it should be exercised only sparingly and in a clear case.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another restriction on the application of the doctrine of inherent jurisdiction appears to be that inherent jurisdiction cannot be used to create new rules of [[substantive law]].

The [[rules of civil procedure]] in various provinces in Canada have varying relationships with the inherent jurisdiction of their courts. In [[Ontario]] the Rules of Civil Procedure are considered to be regulations of the [[Courts of Justice Act]], and thus an expression of legislative will. They are created and amended by a "Civil Rules Committee" which consists of fourteen judges and thirteen other persons involved in the legal community including the [[Attorney General of Canada|Attorney General]] or his representative. The rules are subject to the approval of the [[Lieutenant Governor of Ontario|Lieutenant Governor in Council]]. The judges of the Court obviously have a part in the making of the rules, but the rules are regulations under the Act. Inherent jurisdiction cannot be used to conflict with the unambiguous expression of the Rules.

In [[Nova Scotia]], on the other hand, the Rules of Civil Procedure are made by the judges of the [[Supreme Court of Nova Scotia|Superior Court]] and the [[Nova Scotia Court of Appeal|Court of Appeal]] pursuant to s.46 of the [[Judicature Act]]. The [[Attorney General of Nova Scotia|Attorney General]] does not have a hand in their creation, and they are not subject to approval by the [[Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia|Lieutenant Governor in Council]]. The Court of Appeal for Nova Scotia has taken the position that a single judge of the court may use the inherent jurisdiction of the court to manage its own procedures.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6828">'''Interlocus contest evolution''' (ICE) is a process of intergenomic conflict by which different [[locus (genetics)|loci]] within a single [[genome]] antagonistically [[coevolution|coevolve]]. ICE supposes that the [[Red Queen hypothesis|Red Queen process]], which is characterized by a never-ending antagonistic [[evolutionary arms race]], does not only apply to [[species]] but also to [[gene]]s within the genome of a species.&lt;ref name="Rice_Holland_1997"&gt;Rice &amp; Holland, 1997. "[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Brett_Holland/publication/227329481_The_enemies_within_Intergenomic_conflict_interlocus_contest_evolution_ICE_and_the_intraspecific_Red_Queen/links/0c960520406849c122000000.pdf The enemies within: intergenomic conflict, interlocus contest evolution (ICE), and the intraspecific Red Queen]." Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology 41(1): 1-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because [[genetic recombination|sexual recombination]] allows different gene loci to evolve semi-autonomously, genes have the potential to coevolve antagonistically. ICE occurs when "an allelic substitution at one locus selects for a new allele at the interacting locus, and vice versa." As a result, ICE can lead to a chain reaction of perpetual gene substitution at antagonistically interacting loci, and no stable equilibrium can be achieved. The rate of evolution thus increases at that locus.&lt;ref name="Rice_Holland_1997"/&gt;

ICE is thought to be the dominant mode of evolution for genes controlling social behavior.&lt;ref name="Rice_Holland_1997"/&gt; The ICE process can explain many biological phenomena, including intersexual conflict, [[parent offspring conflict]], and interference competition.

==Intersexual conflict==
{{main|Interlocus sexual conflict}}
A fundamental conflict between the sexes lies in differences in investment: males generally invest predominantly in fertilization while females invest predominantly in offspring.&lt;ref&gt;Bateman, AJ. 1948. “[http://www2.nau.edu/~shuster/shustercourses/BIO%20698/Literature/Bateman1948.pdf Intra-sexual selection in Drosophila].” Heredity 2: 349-368.&lt;/ref&gt; This conflict manifests itself in many traits associated with [[sexual reproduction]]. Genes expressed in only one sex are selectively neutral in the other sex; male- and female-linked genes can therefore be acted upon separated by selection and will evolve semi-autonomously.&lt;ref name="Rice_Holland_1997"/&gt; Thus, one sex of a species may evolve to better itself rather than better the species as a whole, sometimes with negative results for the opposite sex: loci will antagonistically coevolve to enhance male reproductive success at females’ expense on the one hand, and to enhance female resistance to male coercion on the other.&lt;ref&gt;Trivers, R.L. 1972. "[http://www1.appstate.edu/~kms/classes/psy2664/Documents/trivers.pdf Parental investment and sexual selection] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304025739/http://www1.appstate.edu/~kms/classes/psy2664/Documents/trivers.pdf |date=2016-03-04 }}." Sexual Selection and the Descent of Man, 1871–1971. Campbell, Aldine Publishing. 136–179.&lt;/ref&gt; This is an example of [[intralocus sexual conflict]], and is unlikely to be resolved fully throughout the genome. However, in some cases this conflict may be resolved by the restriction of the gene’s expression to only the sex that it benefits, resulting in [[sexual dimorphism]].&lt;ref&gt;Bonduriansky, R, SF Chenoweth. 2009. "Intralocus sexual conflict." Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution 24(5): 280-288.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ICE theory can explain the differentiation of the human [[X chromosome|X-]] and [[Y chromosome|Y-chromosomes]]. Semi-autonomous evolution may have promoted genes beneficial to females in the X-chromosome even when detrimental to males, and genes beneficial to males in the Y-chromosome, even when detrimental to females. As the distribution of the X-chromosome is three times as large as the Y-chromosome (the X-chromosome occurs in 3/4 of offspring genes, while the Y-chromosome occurs in only 1/4), the Y-chromosome has a reduced opportunity for rapid evolution. Thus the Y-chromosome has "shed" its genes to leave only the essential ones (such as the [[Testis determining factor|SRY gene]]), which gives rise to the differences in the X- and Y-chromosomes.&lt;ref&gt;Ridley, M. 2000. Genome: The Autobiography of a Species in 23 Chapters. Harper and Collins.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parent–offspring conflict==
A father, mother and offspring may differ in the optimal resource allocation to the offspring. This co-evolutionary conflict can be considered in the context of ICE. Selection will favor genes in the male to maximize female investment in the current offspring, no matter the consequences to the female's reproduction later in life, while selection will favor genes in the female that increase her overall lifetime [[fitness (biology)|fitness]]. Genes expressed in the offspring will be selected to produce an intermediary level of resource allocation between the male-benefit and female-benefit loci. This three-way conflict again occurs when parents feed their offspring, as the optimum feeding rate and optimum point in time to discontinue feeding differ between father, mother and offspring.&lt;ref name="Rice_Holland_1997"/&gt;

==Interference competition==
ICE can also explain the theory of [[interference competition]], which is most likely to be associated with opposing sets of genes that determine the outcome of [[competition]] between individuals. Different sets of genes may code for signal or receiver [[phenotype]]s, such as in the context of [[Deimatic behavior|threat displays]]: when a competing male can win more contests by intimidation, rather than by fighting, selection will favor the accumulation of deceitful genes that may not be honest indicators of the male’s fighting capability.&lt;ref name="Rice_Holland_1997"/&gt;

For example, primitive male [[elephant seal]]s may have used the lowest frequencies in the threat call of a rival as an indication of body size. The elephant seal's enormous nose may have evolved as a resonating device to amplify low frequencies,&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomew, GA, NE Collias. 1962. "The role of vocalization in the social behaviour of the northern elephant seal." Animal Behaviour 10(1): 7-14.&lt;/ref&gt; illustrating selection that favors the production of low-frequency threat vocalizations. However, this counter-selects for receptor systems that provide an increased threshold required for intimidation, which in turn selects for deeper threat vocalizations. The rapid divergence of threat displays among closely related species provides further evidence in support of the co-evolutionary arms race within the genome of a single species, driven by the ICE process.&lt;ref name="Rice_Holland_1997"/&gt;

An '''intrinsic''' [[Property (philosophy)|property]] is a property that an object or a thing has of itself, independently of other things, including its context.  An '''extrinsic''' (or '''relational''') property is a property that depends on a thing's relationship with other things. For example, [[mass]] is an intrinsic property of any [[Physical body|physical object]], whereas [[weight]] is an extrinsic property that varies depending on the strength of the gravitational field in which the respective object is placed. As such, the question of intrinsicality and extrinsicality in empirically observable objects is a significant field of study in [[ontology]], the branch of [[philosophy]] concerned with explaining the fundamental nature of [[being]].

==Criteria==
[[David Lewis (philosopher)|David Lewis]] offered a list of criteria that should condense the distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic properties (numbers and [[Italic type|italics]] added):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lewis |first=David |authorlink=David Lewis (philosopher) |title=Extrinsic Properties |journal=Philosophical Studies |volume=44 |pages=197–200 |publisher=Springer Netherlands |year=1983 |issn=0031-8116 |doi=10.1007/bf00354100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# A sentence or statement or proposition that ascribes intrinsic properties to something is entirely ''about that thing''; whereas an ascription of extrinsic properties to something is not entirely about that thing, though it may well be about some larger whole which includes that thing as part. 
# A thing has its intrinsic properties in virtue of ''the way that thing itself, and nothing else, is''. Not so for extrinsic properties, though a thing may well have these in virtue of the way some larger whole is. 
# The intrinsic properties of something ''depend only on that thing''; whereas the extrinsic properties of something may depend, wholly or partly, on something else. 
# If something has an intrinsic property, then so does ''any perfect duplicate'' of that thing; whereas duplicates situated in different surroundings will differ in their extrinsic properties.

==Value==
Intrinsic properties are fundamental in understanding [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]ian [[deontological]] ethics, which is based upon the argument that an action should be viewed on its [[intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value]] (the value of the action in itself) with regard to [[ethics]] and [[morality]], as opposed to [[consequentialist]] [[utilitarian]] arguments that an action should be viewed by the value of its outcomes.

==Intrinsicism and extrinsicism==

===Intrinsicism===
Intrinsicism is the belief that value is a non-relational characteristic of an object. This means that an object can be valuable or not, good or bad, without reference to who it is good or bad for, and without reference to the reason it is good or bad. One example of this might be the belief that certain sex acts are intrinsically evil, even if they harm no one.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.importanceofphilosophy.com/Evil_Intrinsicism.html Importance of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extrinsicism===
Extrinsicism is the tendency to place major emphasis on external matters rather than on more profound realities. In terms of morals and ethics, it tends to stress the external observance of laws and precepts, with lesser concern for the ultimate principles underlying moral conduct.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/199189/extrinsicism Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30245">{{short description|A movement of activists whose Judaism informs their support left-wing or liberal causes}}
The '''Jewish left''' consists of [[Jews]] who identify with, or support, [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] or [[Liberalism|liberal]] causes, consciously as Jews, either as individuals or through organizations. There is no one organization or movement which constitutes the Jewish left, however. Jews have been major forces in the history of the [[labor movement]], the [[settlement house]] movement, the [[women's rights]] movement, [[anti-racist]] work, and [[anti-fascist]] and [[anti-capitalist]] organizations of many forms in [[Europe]], the [[United States]] and modern-day [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/newleft.html "The New Left."] ''Jewish Virtual Library'' (2008); retrieved 6 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Jews have a rich history of involvement in [[Jewish anarchism|anarchism]], [[socialism]], [[Marxism]], and Western [[liberalism]]. Although the expression "on the left" covers a range of politics, many well-known figures "on the left" have been of Jews who were born into Jewish families and have various degrees of connection to Jewish communities, Jewish culture, Jewish tradition, or the Jewish religion in its many variants.

==History==
Jewish leftism has its philosophic roots in the Jewish Enlightenment, or [[Haskalah]], led by thinkers such as [[Moses Mendelssohn]], as well as the support of many European Jews such as [[Ludwig Börne]] for [[republicanism|republican]] ideals in the aftermath of the [[French Revolution]] and the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, a movement for [[Jewish Emancipation]] spread across [[Europe]], strongly associated with the emergence of [[political liberalism]], based on the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] principles of [[rights]] and [[equality under the law]]. Because liberals represented the political left of the time (see [[left-right politics]]), emancipated Jews, as they entered the political culture of the nations where they lived, became closely associated with liberal parties. Thus, many Jews supported the [[American Revolution]] of 1776, the [[French Revolution]] of 1789, and the [[Revolutions of 1848|European Revolutions of 1848]]; while [[History of the Jews in England|Jews in England]] tended to vote for the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]], which had led the parliamentary struggle for [[Emancipation of the Jews in England|Jewish Emancipation]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoffrey Alderman]] (1983) ''The Jewish Community in British Politics'', Oxford: Clarendon.&lt;/ref&gt; — an arrangement called by some scholars "the liberal Jewish compromise".&lt;ref&gt;see Sharman Kadish ''Bolsheviks and British Jews'', London: Frank Cass. (1992, e. g., pp. 55-60, 132); Jonathan Hyman [http://www.humanities.manchester.ac.uk/medialibrary/arts/history/workingpapers/wp_50.pdf ''Jews in Britain During the Great War''], Manchester: University of Manchester Working Papers in Economic and Social History No. 51, October (2001, e. g., p. 11). The phrase was coined by [[Steven Bayme]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===The emergence of a Jewish working class===
In the age of [[industrialisation]] in the late nineteenth century, a Jewish [[working class]] emerged in the cities of [[Eastern Europe|Eastern]] and [[Central Europe]]. Before long, a Jewish [[labour movement]] emerged too. The Jewish Labour Bund–[[General Jewish Labor Union]] was formed in [[Lithuania]], Poland, and Russia in 1897.&lt;ref&gt;Mendes, Philip. [http://jewishcurrents.org/rise-fall-jewish-labor-bund-23131 "The Rise and Fall of the Jewish Labor Bund"], ''Jewish Currents'' (Autumn 2013); accessed 8 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Distinctive Jewish [[socialist]] organizations formed and spread across the Jewish [[Pale of Settlement]] in the [[Russian Empire]]. There were also a significant number of people of Jewish origin who did not explicitly identify as Jews per se, but were active in anarchist, socialist, and social democratic as well as communist organizations, movements, and parties.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

As [[Zionism]] grew in strength as a political movement, [[socialist Zionist]] parties were formed, such as [[Ber Borochov]]'s [[Poale Zion]]. There were non-Zionist left-wing forms of [[Jewish nationalism]], such as [[Jewish Territorialist Organization|territorialism]] (which called for a Jewish national homeland, but not necessarily in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]), [[Jewish Autonomism|autonomism]] (which called for non-territorial national rights for Jews in multinational empires), and the [[Folkspartei|folkism]], advocated by [[Simon Dubnow]], (which celebrated the [[cultural Judaism|Jewish culture]] of the [[Yiddish]]-speaking masses).{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

As Eastern European Jews migrated West from the 1880s, these ideologies took root in growing Jewish communities, such as [[London]]'s [[East End]], [[Paris]]'s [[Pletzl]], [[New York City]]'s [[Lower East Side]], and [[Buenos Aires]]. There was a lively Jewish anarchist scene in London, a central figure of which was, the non-Jewish German thinker and writer [[Rudolf Rocker]]. The important Jewish socialist movement in the United States, with its Yiddish-language daily, ''[[The Forward]]'', and trade unions such as the [[International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union]] and the [[Amalgamated Clothing Workers]]. Important figures in these milieux included [[Rose Schneiderman]], [[Abraham Cahan]], [[Morris Winchevsky]], and [[David Dubinsky]].

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Jews played a major role in the [[Social Democratic]] parties of [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Germany]], [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party|Russia]], [[Social Democratic Party of Austria|Austria-Hungary]], and [[Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania|Poland]]. Historian [[Enzo Traverso]] has used the term "Judeo-Marxism" to describe the innovative forms of [[Marxism]] associated with these Jewish socialists. These ranged from strongly [[Cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] positions hostile to all forms of [[nationalism]] (as with [[Rosa Luxemburg]] and, to a lesser extent, [[Leon Trotsky]]) to positions more sympathetic to cultural nationalism (as with the [[Austromarxists]] or [[Vladimir Medem]]).

===In Soviets and against fascism===
As with the American revolution of 1776, the French revolution of 1789, and the German revolution of 1848, many Jews worldwide welcomed the [[Russian revolution of 1917]], celebrating the fall of a regime that had presided over antisemitic [[pogroms]], and believing that the new order in what was to become the Soviet Union would bring improvements in the situation of Jews in those lands. Many Jews became involved in [[Communist parties]], constituting large proportions of their membership in many countries, including [[Great Britain]] and the U.S. There were specifically Jewish sections of many Communist parties, such as the [[Yevsektsiya]] in the [[Soviet Union]]. The Communist regime in the USSR pursued what could be characterised as ambivalent policies towards Jews and Jewish culture, at times supporting their development as a national culture (e. g., sponsoring significant Yiddish language scholarship and creating an [[Jewish Autonomous Oblast|autonomous Jewish territory]] in [[Birobidzhan]]), at times pursuing antisemitic purges, such as that in the wake of the so-called [[Doctors' plot]]. (See also [[Komzet]].)

With the advent of [[fascism]] in parts of Europe in the 1920s and 1930s, many Jews responded by becoming actively involved in the left, and particularly the Communist parties, which were at the forefront of the [[anti-fascist]] movement. For example, many Jewish volunteers fought in the [[International Brigades]] in the [[Spanish Civil War]] (for instance in the American [[Abraham Lincoln Brigade]] and in the Polish-Jewish [[Naftali Botwin Company]]). Jews and leftists fought [[Oswald Mosley]]'s British fascists at the [[Battle of Cable Street]]. This mass movement was influenced by the [[Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee]] in the Soviet Union.

In [[World War II]], the Jewish left played a major part in [[Resistance during World War II|resistance to Nazism]]. For example, Bundists and left Zionists were key in [[Żydowska Organizacja Bojowa]] and the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]]. {{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

===Radical Jews in Central and Western Europe===
As well as the movements rooted in the Jewish working class, relatively [[Jewish assimilation|assimilated]] [[middle class]] Jews in Central and Western Europe began to search for sources of radicalism in Jewish tradition. For example, [[Martin Buber]] drew on [[Hasidism]] in articulating his anarchist philosophy, [[Gershom Scholem]] was an anarchist and a [[kabbalah]] scholar, [[Walter Benjamin]] was equally influenced by [[Marxism]] and Jewish [[messianism]], [[Gustav Landauer]] was a religious Jew and a [[libertarian communist]], [[Jacob Israël de Haan]] combined socialism with [[Haredi]] Judaism, while [[left-libertarian]] [[Bernard Lazare]] became a passionately Jewish Zionist in 1897, but wrote 2 years later to Herzl - and by extension to the [[Zionist Action Committee]] -, "You are [[bourgeois]] in thoughts, bourgeois in your feelings, bourgeois in your ideas, bourgeois in your conception of society.".&lt;ref&gt;Gabriel Piterberg (2008), ''The Returns of Zionism: Myths, Politics, and Scholarship in Israel'', London: Verso, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Weimar Germany]], [[Walther Rathenau]] was a leading figure of the Jewish left.

===Socialist Zionism and the Israeli left===
{{Main|Labor Zionism}}
In the twentieth century, especially after the [[Second Aliyah]], socialist Zionism - first developed in Russia by the Marxist Ber Borochov and the non-Marxists [[Nachman Syrkin]] and [[A. D. Gordon]] - became a powerful force in the [[Yishuv]], the Jewish settlement in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. Poale Zion, the [[Histadrut]] labour union and the [[Mapai]] party played a major part in the campaign for an [[Israel|Israeli state]], with socialist politicians like [[David Ben-Gurion]] and [[Golda Meir]] amongst the founders of the nation. At the same time, the [[kibbutz]] movement was an experiment in practical socialism.

In the 1940s, many on the left advocated a [[binational state]] in Israel/Palestine, rather than an exclusively Jewish state. (This position was taken by [[Hannah Arendt]] and [[Martin Buber]], for example). Since independence in 1948, there has been a lively Israeli left, both Zionist ([[Labor Party (Israel)|the Labour Party]], [[Meretz-Yachad|Meretz]]) and [[anti-Zionist]] ([[Palestine Communist Party]], [[Maki (historical political party)|Maki]]). The Labour Party and its predecessors have been in power in Israel for significant periods since 1948.

There are two worldwide groupings of left-wing Zionist organizations. The World Labour Zionist Movement, associated with the Labor Zionist tendency, is a loose association, including [[Labor Party (Israel)|Avoda]], [[Habonim Dror]], [[Histadrut]] and [[Na'amat]]. The [[Meretz|World Union of Meretz]], associated with what was historically known as the Socialist Zionist tendency, is a loose association of the Israeli Meretz party, the [[Hashomer Hatzair]] Socialist Zionist youth movement, the [[Kibbutz Movement|Kibbutz Artzi Federation]] and the [[Givat Haviva]] research and study center. Both movements exist as factions within the [[World Zionist Organization]], as well as regional or country-specific Zionist movements; the two roughly correspond to the interwar split between the Poale Zion Right (the tradition that led to Avoda) and the Poale Zion Left (Hashomer Hatzair, Mapam, Meretz).

===Apartheid South Africa===
South Africa's Jewish left-wing was heavily involved in left-wing causes such as the anti-apartheid movement. The most famous member of the anti-apartheid Jewish left-wing was [[Helen Suzman|Helen Suzman, DBE]]. There were also several liberal left-wing Jewish defendants in the [[Rivonia Trial]]: [[Joe Slovo]], [[Denis Goldberg]], [[Lionel Bernstein]], [[Bob Hepple]], [[Arthur Goldreich]], [[Harold Wolpe]], and [[James Kantor]].

==Contemporary Jewish left==
===1960s–1990s===
As the Jewish working class died out in the years after the [[Second World War]], its institutions and political movements did too. The [[Arbeter Ring]] in England, for example, came to an end in the 1950s and Jewish trade unionism in the US ceased to be a major force at that time. There are, however, still some remnants of the Jewish working class organizations left today, including the [[Workmen's Circle]], [[Jewish Labor Committee]], and ''[[The Forward]]'' (newspaper) in New York, the [[International Jewish Labor Bund]] in Australia, and the [[United Jewish People's Order]] in Canada.

The 1960s-1980s saw a renewal of interest among Western Jews in Jewish [[working class culture]] and the various radical traditions of the Jewish past. This led to the growth of a new sort of radical Jewish organization that was both interested in Yiddish culture, Jewish spirituality, and social justice. In the US, for example, between 1980–1992, [[New Jewish Agenda]] functioned as a national, multi-issue progressive membership organization with the mission of acting as a "Jewish voice on the Left and a Left voice in the Jewish Community". In 1991, Jews for Racial and Economic Justice formed to fight for "equitable distribution of economic and cultural resources and political power" in New York City. And in 1999, leftists broke from the LA chapter of the American Jewish Congress to form the [[Progressive Jewish Alliance]]. In Britain, the [[Jewish Socialists' Group]] and Rabbi [[Michael Lerner (rabbi)|Michael Lerner]]'s [[Tikkun (magazine)|Tikkun]] have similarly continued this tradition, while more recently groups like [[Jewdas]] have taken an even more eclectic and radical approach to Jewishness. In [[Belgium]], the [[Union des progressistes juifs de Belgique]] is, since 1969, the heir of the Jewish Communist and Bundist Solidarité movement in the [[Belgian Resistance]], embracing the [[Refusal to serve in the Israeli military|Israeli refuseniks]] cause as well as of the undocumented immigrants in Belgium.

===2000s–present===
During the first decade of the 2000s, the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]] became a defining element in the composition of the diasporic Jewish left. A new wave of Jewish organizations formed to support Palestinian causes. Groups such as [[Jewish Voice for Peace]], [[Independent Jewish Voices (Canada)]], [[Independent Jewish Voices|Independent Jewish Voices (UK)]] and the [[International Jewish Anti-Zionist Network]] gave renewed voice to [[Jewish Anti-Zionism]]. This perspective continues to be reflected in media outlets such as [[Mondoweiss]] and the Treyf Podcast.

Following the [[2014 Israel–Gaza conflict]], many leftist Jewish organizations in the US and Canada focused on directly challenging establishment Jewish organizations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://canadiandimension.com/articles/view/direct-action-disrupts-israeli-canadian-complicity-in-settler-colonialism|title=Direct action disrupts Jewish-Canadian complicity in settler colonialism – Canadian Dimension|website=Canadiandimension.com|accessdate=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mondoweiss.net/2014/09/collapse-israel-consensus|title=The rise of 'If Not Now' and the collapse of the pro-Israel consensus|website=Mondoweiss.net|date=2014-09-10|accessdate=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forward.com/news/national/339090/17-jewish-activists-protesting-israeli-occupation-arrested-at-adl-headquart/ |title=17 Jewish Activists Protesting Israeli Occupation Arrested at ADL Headquarters|website=Forward.com|accessdate=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mondoweiss.net/2015/07/louis-cancel-police|title=St. Louis Jews call on ADL to cancel honor to police|website=Mondoweiss.net|date=2015-07-18|accessdate=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as the [[Jewish Federations|Jewish Federation]], [[American Israel Public Affairs Committee]], the [[Anti-Defamation League]], and [[Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs]], for their support for Israel's actions during the conflict. In the US, this intra-community conflict expanded to domestic politics following the [[United States presidential election, 2016]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://jewschool.com/2016/11/78055/photos-young-jews-march-on-trump-hq-stopbannon|title=PHOTOS: Young Jews march on Trump HQ: #StopBannon: Will the Jewish Federations of North America follow suit?|website=Jewschool.com|accessdate=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groups such as If Not Now, [[Jewish Voice for Peace]], and Jews for Racial and Economic Justice began organizing under the banner of #JewishResistance to "challenge institutional Jewish support for the Trump administration and affiliated white nationalists".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mic.com/articles/160010/hundreds-join-jewish-resistance-protest-against-trump-chief-strategist-steve-bannon#.mNWlaFWoe|title=Hundreds join #JewishResistance protest against Trump chief strategist Steve Bannon|website=Mic.com|date=2016-11-21|accessdate=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary Israeli left===
Operating in a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] governmental system based on [[proportional representation]], left-wing political parties and blocs in Israel have been able to elect members of the [[Knesset]] with varying degrees of success. Over time, those parties have evolved, with some merging, others disappearing, and new parties arising.

Israeli left-wing parties have included:
*[[Hadash]]
*[[Mapam]]
*[[Meretz-Yachad]]
*[[HaAvoda]]
*[[Meimad]]
*[[Progressive List for Peace]]
*[[Ratz (political party)|Ratz]]
*[[Left Camp of Israel]]
*[[HaOlam HaZeh – Koah Hadash]]

Notable figures in these parties have included: [[Meir Vilner]], [[Shulamit Aloni]], [[Uri Avnery]], [[Yossi Beilin]], [[Ran Cohen]], [[Mattityahu Peled|Matti Peled]], [[Amnon Rubinstein]], and [[Yossi Sarid]].

{{further|Politics of Israel#Political left}}

==British Jewish left==
[[British Jews]] have been influential in the left-wing [[politics of the United Kingdom]] for many years, especially in the main social democratic/socialist party, the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], but also in the socially liberal [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]].

During the years when the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] was Britain's main party of the left, two Jews in particular attained high office: [[Herbert Samuel, 1st Viscount Samuel|Herbert Samuel]], who led the Liberal Party from 1930–1935, and [[Rufus Isaacs, 1st Marquess of Reading|Rufus Isaacs]], the only British Jew to have been created a Marquess. Other notable Liberal Jews of the 1800s and early 1900s included: [[Lionel de Rothschild]], the first Jew to serve as an MP, [[David Salomons|Sir David Salomons]], [[Francis Goldsmid|Sir Francis Goldsmid]], [[George Jessel (jurist)|Sir George Jessel]], [[Arthur Cohen (politician)|Arthur Cohen]], [[Samuel Montagu, 1st Baron Swaythling|The Lord Swaythling]], [[Sir Edward Sassoon, 2nd Baronet, of Kensington Gore|Sir Edward Sassoon]], [[Leslie Hore-Belisha, 1st Baron Hore-Belisha|The Lord Hore-Belisha]] [[Edwin Samuel Montagu]], [[Ignaz Trebitsch-Lincoln]], and [[Sydney Stern, 1st Baron Wandsworth|The Lord Wandsworth]].

In the early part of the 20th century, the Liberal Party gave way to the more radical and socialist Labour Party. [[Leonard Woolf]] and [[Hugh Franklin (suffragist)|Hugh Franklin]] were among the figures influential in the early Labour Party, and Jewish MPs like [[Barnett Janner, Baron Janner|Barnett Janner]], [[Sir Percy Harris, 1st Baronet|Sir Percy Harris]] and [[Harry Nathan, 1st Baron Nathan|The Lord Nathan]] were among the radical Liberal MPs, many of whom switched from Liberal to Labour, economists like [[Harold Laski]] and [[Nicholas Kaldor]] and intellectuals like [[Victor Gollancz]] and [[Karl Mannheim]] provided the intellectual impetus for British socialism to take hold. Prominent early Labour MPs included [[Lewis Silkin, 1st Baron Silkin|The Lord Silkin]], who became a Minister in [[Clement Attlee]]'s government, [[Sydney Silverman]], who abolished [[capital punishment]] in Britain, and [[Manny Shinwell, Baron Shinwell|The Lord Shinwell]], one of the leaders of [[Red Clydeside]] who later became [[Secretary of State for War]].

At the end of the [[Second World War]], the Labour Party entered government again, and several newly elected Labour MPs were Jewish, and often on the socialist left of the Party, radicalised by incidents like the [[Battle of Cable Street]]. Those MPs included [[Herschel Lewis Austin]], [[Maurice Edelman]], and [[Ian Mikardo]], as well as [[Phil Piratin]], one of only four MPs in British history to have represented the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]]. Several MPs elected in the 1940s and 1950s went on to be Ministers in [[Harold Wilson]]'s governments of the 1960s and 1970s: [[Joel Barnett, Baron Barnett|The Lord Barnett]], [[Edmund Dell]], [[John Diamond, Baron Diamond|John Diamond]], [[Reg Freeson]], [[Dora Gaitskell, Baroness Gaitskell|The Baroness Gaitskell]], [[Myer Galpern]], [[Gerald Kaufman]], [[Harold Lever, Baron Lever of Manchester|The Lord Lever of Manchester]], [[Paul Rose (UK politician)|Paul Rose]], [[Samuel Segal, Baron Segal|The Lord Segal]], [[Beatrice Serota, Baroness Serota|The Baroness Serota]], [[Robert Sheldon, Baron Sheldon|The Lord Sheldon]], [[John Silkin|John]] and [[Samuel Silkin, Baron Silkin of Dulwich|Samuel Silkin]], [[Barnett Stross]], and [[David Weitzman]]. A prominent Jewish Labour politician in this era was [[Leo Abse]], who put forward the private members' bill which decriminalised homosexuality and reformed the divorce laws in Britain. [[Robert Maxwell]], a Labour MP during the 1964–66 Wilson government, eventually became a leading newspaper publisher when his holding company purchased [[Mirror Group Newspapers]] in 1984.

In the 1970s and 1980s, the Labour Party experienced significant turbulence with the rise of the [[Entryism|entryist]] [[Militant (Trotskyist group)|Militant tendency]] (a [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] group led by [[Ted Grant]]), and the centre-left [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]] (SDP) breaking away and forming an [[SDP–Liberal Alliance|Alliance]] with the Liberal Party (who had two Jewish MPs, [[Alex Carlile, Baron Carlile of Berriew|The Lord Carlile of Berriew]] and [[Clement Freud]]), later to unite as the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]]. One such parliamentary defector to the SDP was [[Neville Sandelson]], and the [[Keynesian]] economist [[Robert Skidelsky, Baron Skidelsky|The Lord Skidelsky]] also defected. Those Jewish Labour MPs who stuck with the party included [[Harry Cohen]], [[Alf Dubs, Baron Dubs|Alf Dubs]], [[Millie Miller]], [[Eric Moonman]], and [[David Winnick]].

During the late 1980s and 1990s, with the shift away from the socialist left of the party, and during [[Tony Blair]]'s leadership of the Labour Party, notable senior Jewish politicians included [[Peter Mandelson]], one of the architects of "[[New Labour]]", [[Peter Goldsmith, Baron Goldsmith]], [[Jeremy Beecham, Baron Beecham|The Lord Beecham]], and [[Philip Gould, Baron Gould of Brookwood|The Lord Gould of Brookwood]]. Mandelson, party fund-raiser [[Michael Levy, Baron Levy|The Lord Levy]] and [[Jack Straw]] (who is of partial Jewish ancestry), were accused by [[Tam Dalyell]], MP, of being a "[[cabal]] of Jewish advisers" around Blair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2999219.stm|title=Dalyell's 'Jewish cabal' remarks denied|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several of Blair's Ministers and Labour backbenchers were Jewish or partially Jewish, including [[Barbara Roche]], [[Margaret Hodge|Dame Margaret Hodge]], [[Fabian Hamilton]], [[Louise Ellman]], [[Helene Hayman, Baroness Hayman|The Baroness Hayman]], [[Oona King, Baroness King of Bow|The Baroness King of Bow]], and [[Gillian Merron]]. Labour donors during the 1990s and 2000s who were Jewish included [[David Abrahams (businessman)|David Abrahams]], [[Alexander Bernstein, Baron Bernstein of Craigweil|The Lord Bernstein of Craigweil]], [[Richard Caring]], [[Trevor Chinn|Sir Trevor Chinn]], [[David Garrard (property developer)|Sir David Garrard]], [[Robert Gavron, Baron Gavron|The Lord Gavron]], [[Emmanuel Kaye|Sir Emmanuel Kaye]], [[Andrew Rosenfeld]], [[David Sainsbury, Baron Sainsbury of Turville|The Lord Sainsbury of Turville]], and [[Barry Townsley]]. Several of these were caught up in the [[Cash for Honours]] scandal.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Under the government of Blair's successor, [[Gordon Brown]], brothers [[David Miliband]] and [[Ed Miliband]] became members of the Cabinet. Their father was the Marxist academic [[Ralph Miliband]]. The brothers differed in their view of the party's future direction, and they fought a bitter [[Labour Party (UK) leadership election, 2010|leadership election]] against each other in 2010. Ed Miliband won the election and became the first Jewish leader of the Labour Party. One of Miliband's Shadow Cabinet members, [[Ivan Lewis]], as well as advisers [[David Axelrod (political consultant)|David Axelrod]], [[Industrial Areas Foundation|Arnie Graf]], and [[Maurice Glasman, Baron Glasman|The Lord Glasman]] are all Jewish.

Current Jewish Labour politicians include: [[William Bach, Baron Bach|William Bach]], [[Steve Bassam, Baron Bassam of Brighton|The Lord Bassam of Brighton]], [[Luciana Berger]], [[Michael Cashman]], [[Anthony Grabiner, Baron Grabiner|The Lord Grabiner]], [[Ruth Henig, Baroness Henig|Ruth Henig]], [[Jonathan Kestenbaum, Baron Kestenbaum|The Lord Kestenbaum]], [[Jonathan Mendelsohn]], [[Janet Neel Cohen, Baroness Cohen of Pimlico|Janet Neel Cohen]], [[Meta Ramsay, Baroness Ramsay of Cartvale|Meta Ramsay]], [[Catherine Stihler]], [[Andrew Stone, Baron Stone of Blackheath|Andrew Stone]], [[Alan Sugar]], [[Leslie Turnberg, Baron Turnberg|Leslie Turnberg]], and [[Robert Winston]].

Since the foundation of the Liberal Democrats, several Jews have achieved prominence: [[David Alliance, Baron Alliance|David Alliance]], the aforementioned Alex Carlisle, [[Miranda Green (journalist)|Miranda Green]], [[Rosalind Grender, Baroness Grender|Olly Grender]], [[Sally Hamwee, Baroness Hamwee|Sally Hamwee]], [[Evan Harris]], [[Susan Kramer, Baroness Kramer|Susan Kramer]], [[Anthony Lester, Baron Lester of Herne Hill|Anthony Lester]], [[Jonathan Marks, Baron Marks of Henley-on-Thames|Jonathan Marks]], [[Julia Neuberger, Baroness Neuberger|Julia Neuberger]], [[Monroe Palmer, Baron Palmer of Childs Hill|Monroe Palmer]], [[Paul Strasburger, Baron Strasburger|Paul Strasburger]], and [[Lynne Featherstone]], who became a Minister in the [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|Coalition government 2010-15]].

'''Kshama''' ({{lang-sa|[[wikt:क्षमा|क्षमा]]}}, ''{{IAST|kṣamā}}'') is a [[Sanskrit]] word that relates to the acts of patience, releasing time and functioning in the now. [[A. A. Macdonnell|Macdonell]] defines it as: "patience, forbearance, indulgence (towards...)".&lt;ref&gt;See Macdonnell's [https://dsalsrv04.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/new_chuck/macdonell_query.py?qs=%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B7%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%BE&amp;searchhws=yes dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; kshama word has a rich in meaning. It simply means forgiveness or forbearance. Kshama also indicates extreme patience and an more capacity to forget as also forgive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sssbpt.info/summershowers/ss2000/ss2000-12.pdf|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of Kshama forms one of the Ten Traditional [[Yamas]], or restraints, that are codified in numerous scriptures including the [[Shandilya Upanishad|Shandilya]] and [[Varaha Upanishad]]s and the [[Hatha Yoga Pradipika]] by [[Gorakshanath]]a.

It is sometimes used as a female given name.

'''Latency''' is a time interval between the stimulation and response, or, from a more general point of view, a time delay between the cause and the effect of some physical change in the system being observed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/L/latency.html "What is Latency?" / "Latency"] Retrieved 2015-02-22.&lt;/ref&gt; Latency is physically a consequence of the limited velocity with which any physical interaction can propagate. The magnitude of this velocity is always less than or equal to the [[speed of light]]. Therefore, every physical system will experience some sort of latency, regardless of the nature of stimulation that it has been exposed to.

The precise definition of latency depends on the system being observed and the nature of stimulation.  In communications, the lower limit of latency is determined by the medium being used for communications.  In reliable two-way communication systems, latency limits the maximum rate that information can be transmitted, as there is often a limit on the amount of information that is "in-flight" at any one moment.  In the field of human–machine interaction, perceptible latency has a strong effect on user satisfaction and usability.

==Communication latency==

[[Online game]]s are sensitive to latency since fast response times to new events occurring during a game session are rewarded while slow response times may carry penalties. [[Lag]] is the term used to describe latency in gaming. Due to a delay in transmission of game events, a player with a high latency internet connection may show slow responses in spite of appropriate [[reaction time]].  This gives players with low latency connections a technical advantage.

Minimizing latency is of interest in the [[Low latency (capital markets)|capital markets]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=TABB|title=High Frequency Trading Technology: a TABB Anthology|year=2009|url=http://www.tabbgroup.com/PublicationDetail.aspx?PublicationID=498}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly where [[algorithmic trading]] is used to process market updates and turn around orders within milliseconds. Low-latency trading occurs on the networks used by financial institutions to connect to stock exchanges and electronic communication networks (ECNs) to execute financial transactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mackenzie|first=Michael|title=The dash to flash|url=http://www.themistrading.com/article_files/0000/0493/8-6-09Financial_Times.pdf|accessdate=18 July 2011|newspaper=Financial Times|year=2009|author2=Grant, Jeremy|quote=extracting tiny slices of profit from trading small numbers of shares  in companies, often between different trading platforms, with success relying on minimal variations in speed - or  "latency", in the trading vernacular.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Joel Hasbrouck and Gideon Saar (2011) measure latency based on three components: the time it takes for information to reach the trader, execution of the trader’s algorithms to analyze the information and decide a course of action, and the generated action to reach the exchange and get implemented. Hasbrouck and Saar contrast this with the way in which latencies are measured by many trading venues who use much more narrow definitions, such as, the processing delay measured from the entry of the order (at the vendor’s computer) to the transmission of an acknowledgement (from the vendor’s computer).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hasbrouck |first=Joel |title=Low-Latency Trading |author2=Saar, Gideon |url=http://www2.binghamton.edu/som/files/GideonSaar.pdf |accessdate=18 July 2011 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Electronic trading now makes up 60% to 70% of the daily volume on the [[NYSE]] and algorithmic trading close to 35%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Heires|first=Katherine|title=Code Green: Goldman Sachs &amp; UBS Cases Heighten Need to Keep Valuable Digital Assets From Walking Out The Door.

==={{Anchor|PACKET-SWITCHED}}Packet-switched networks===
{{See also|Bandwidth-delay product|Network delay}}

'''Network latency''' in a [[packet-switched]] network is measured as either [[One-way delay|one-way]] (the time from the source sending a packet to the destination receiving it), or [[round-trip delay time]] (the one-way latency from source to destination plus the one-way latency from the destination back to the source). Round-trip latency is more often quoted, because it can be measured from a single point. Note that round trip latency excludes the amount of time that a destination system spends processing the packet.{{cn|reason=Not supported by [[Round-trip delay time]]. The reality is, some measures include this and some don't|date=June 2018}} Many software platforms provide a service called [[Ping (networking utility)|ping]] that can be used to measure round-trip latency. Ping uses the [[Internet Control Message Protocol]] (ICMP) ''echo request'' which causes the recipient to send the received packet as an immediate response, thus it provides a rough way of measuring round-trip delay time. Ping cannot perform accurate measurements,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.c0t0d0s0.org/archives/7479-Dont-misuse-ping!.html|title=Don't misuse ping!|publisher=|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; principally because ICMP is intended only for diagnostic or control purposes, and differs from real communication protocols such as [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]]. Furthermore, [[Router (computing)|routers]] and [[internet service provider]]s might apply different [[traffic shaping]] policies to different protocols.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

However, in a non-trivial network, a typical packet will be forwarded over multiple links and gateways, each of which will not begin to forward the packet until it has been completely received.  In such a network, the minimal latency is the sum of the transmission delay of each link, plus the forwarding latency of each gateway. In practice, minimal latency also includes queuing and processing delays. [[Queuing delay]] occurs when a gateway receives multiple packets from different sources heading towards the same destination. Since typically only one packet can be transmitted at a time, some of the packets must queue for transmission, incurring additional delay. [[Processing delay]]s  are incurred while a gateway determines what to do with a newly received packet. [[Bufferbloat]] can also cause increased latency that is an order of magnitude or more. The combination of propagation, serialization, queuing, and processing delays often produces a complex and variable network latency profile.

Latency limits total throughput in reliable two-way communication systems as described by the [[bandwidth-delay product]].

===Fiber optics===
Latency in fiber optics is largely a function of the [[speed of light]], which is 299,792,458 meters/second in vacuum.  This would equate to a latency of 3.33&amp;nbsp;[[Microsecond|µs]] for every kilometer of path length.  The [[index of refraction]] of most fibre optic cables is about 1.5, meaning that light travels about 1.5 times as fast in a vacuum as it does in the cable.  This works out to about 5.0&amp;nbsp;µs of latency for every kilometer.  In shorter metro networks, higher latency can be experienced due to extra distance in building risers and cross-connects. To calculate latency of a connection, one has to know the distance traveled by the fibre, which is rarely a straight line, since it has to traverse geographic contours and obstacles, such as roads and railway tracks, as well as other rights-of-way. 

Due to imperfections in the fibre, light degrades as it is transmitted through it. For distances of greater than 100 kilometers, [[Optical amplifier|amplifiers]] or [[Regenerator (telecommunication)|regenerators]] are deployed. Latency introduced by these components needs to be taken into account.&lt;!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]--&gt;

===Satellite transmission===
This is illustrated when a [[news presenter]] in a studio talks with a reporter in a distant place via a geostationary [[communication satellite]]. The signal travels from the newsreader up to and down from the satellite to the reporter and then the reply from the reporter does the same, resulting in four satellite hops incurring a [[Geostationary_orbit#Communications|latency]] on the order of a half second, not including the typically smaller latencies inside the communications equipment.

[[Low Earth orbit]] is sometimes used to cut this delay, at the expense of more complicated satellite tracking on the ground and requiring more satellites in the [[satellite constellation]] to ensure continuous coverage.

==Audio latency==
{{main|Latency (audio)}}

Audio latency is the delay between when an audio signal enters and when it emerges from a system. Potential contributors to latency in an audio system include [[analog-to-digital conversion]], [[Buffer (telecommunication)|buffering]], [[digital signal processing]], [[transmission time]], [[digital-to-analog conversion]] and the [[speed of sound]] in air.

==Operational latency==
Any individual [[workflow]] within a system of workflows can be subject to some type of operational latency.  It may even be the case that an individual system may have more than one type of latency, depending on the type of participant or goal-seeking behavior.  This is best illustrated by the following two examples involving [[air travel]].

===Consumer view===
From the point of view of a passenger, latency can be described as follows.  Suppose John Doe flies from [[London]] to [[New York City|New York]].  The latency of his trip is the time it takes him to go from his house in England to the hotel he is staying at in New York.  This is independent of the throughput of the London-New York air link &amp;ndash; whether there were 100 passengers a day making the trip or 10000, the latency of the trip would remain the same.

===Producer view===
From the point of view of flight operations personnel, latency can be entirely different.  Consider the staff at the London and New York airports.  Only a limited number of planes are able to make the transatlantic journey, so when one lands they must prepare it for the return trip as quickly as possible.  It might take, for example:
*35 minutes to clean a plane
*15 minutes to refuel a plane
*10 minutes to load the passengers
*30 minutes to load the cargo

Assuming the above are done one after another, minimum plane [[turnaround time]] is:
:35 + 15 + 10 + 30 = '''90'''

However, cleaning, refueling and loading the cargo can be done at the same time. Passengers can be loaded after cleaning is complete. The reduced latency, then, is:
:35 + 10 = 45
:15
:30
:Minimum latency = '''45'''

The people involved in the turnaround are interested only in the time it takes for their individual tasks.  When all of the tasks are done at the same time, however, it is possible to reduce the latency to the length of the longest task. If some steps have prerequisites, it becomes more difficult to perform all steps in parallel. In the example above, the requirement to clean the plane before loading passengers results in a minimum latency longer than any single task.

==Mechanical latency==
Any mechanical process encounters limitations modeled by [[Newtonian physics]].  The behavior of [[disk drive]]s provides an example of mechanical latency.  Here, it is the time needed for the data encoded on a platter to rotate from its current position to a position adjacent to the read-write head as well as the seek time required for the actuator arm for the read-write head to be positioned above the appropriate track.  This is also known as [[rotational latency]] and [[seek time]] since the basic term '''latency''' is also applied to the time required by a computer's [[electronics]] and [[software]] to perform [[polling (computer science)|polling]], [[interrupt]]s, and [[direct memory access]].

==Computer hardware and operating system latency==
{{Further|Access time}}

Computers run sets of instructions called a [[Process (computing)|process]].  In [[operating system]]s, the execution of the process can be postponed if other processes are also executing.  In addition, the operating system can schedule when to perform the action that the process is commanding.  For example, suppose a process commands that a computer card's voltage output be set high-low-high-low and so on at a rate of 1000&amp;nbsp;Hz.  The operating system may choose to adjust the scheduling of each transition (high-low or low-high) based on an internal clock.  The latency is the delay between the process instruction commanding the transition and the hardware actually transitioning the voltage from high to low or low to high.

On [[List of Microsoft operating systems|Microsoft Windows]], it appears{{or|date=March 2011}} that the timing of commands to hardware is not exact.  Empirical data suggest that Windows (using the Windows sleep timer which accepts millisecond sleep times) will schedule on a 1024&amp;nbsp;Hz clock and will delay 24 of 1024 transitions per second to make an average of 1000&amp;nbsp;Hz for the update rate.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}  This can have serious ramifications for discrete-time algorithms that rely on fairly consistent timing between updates such as those found in control theory. The sleep function or similar windows API were at no point designed for accurate timing purposes. Certain multimedia-oriented API routines like &lt;code&gt;timeGetTime()&lt;/code&gt; and its siblings provide better timing consistency.  However, consumer- and server-grade Windows ({{as of | 2011 | lc = on}} those based on [[Ntoskrnl.exe|NT kernel]]) were not to be [[real-time operating system]]s. Drastically more accurate timings could be achieved by using dedicated hardware extensions and control-loop cards.

[[Linux]] may have the same problems with scheduling of hardware I/O.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} The problem in Linux is mitigated by support for posix real-time extensions, and the possibility of using a kernel with the [[PREEMPT_RT|PREEMPT_RT patch]] applied.

On embedded systems, the real-time execution of instructions is often supported by the low-level embedded operating system.

==In simulators and simulation==
In simulation applications, 'latency' refers to the time delay, normally measured in [[millisecond]]s (1/1,000 sec), between initial input and an output clearly discernible to the simulator trainee or simulator subject.  Latency is sometimes also called transport delay.

* Some authorities distinguish between latency and transport delay by using the term 'latency' in the sense of the extra time delay of a system over and above the reaction time of the vehicle being simulated, but this requires a detailed knowledge of the [[vehicle dynamics]] and can be controversial.
* Importance of Motion and Visual Latencies.  In simulators with both visual and motion systems, it is particularly important that the latency of the motion system not be greater than of the visual system, or symptoms of [[simulator sickness]] may result.  This is because in the real world, motion cues are those of acceleration and are quickly transmitted to the brain, typically in less than 50 milliseconds; this is followed some milliseconds later by a perception of change in the visual scene.  The visual scene change is essentially one of change of perspective and/or displacement of objects such as the horizon, which takes some time to build up to discernible amounts after the initial acceleration which caused the displacement.  A simulator should therefore reflect the real-world situation by ensuring that the motion latency is equal to or less than that of the visual system and not the other way round.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4504">'''Anti-[[mimesis]]''' is a philosophical position that holds the direct opposite of [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] [[mimesis]].  Its most notable proponent is [[Oscar Wilde]], who opined in his 1889 essay ''[[The Decay of Lying]]'' that, "Life imitates Art far more than Art imitates Life".  In the essay, written as a [[Platonic dialogue]], Wilde holds that anti-[[mimesis]] "results not merely from Life's imitative instinct, but from the fact that the self-conscious aim of Life is to find expression, and that Art offers it certain beautiful forms through which it may realise that energy."&lt;ref name=McGrath1999 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Wilde1889 /&gt;

What is found in life and nature is not what is really there, but is that which artists have taught people to find there, through art.  As in an example posited by Wilde, although there has been fog in London for centuries, one notices the beauty and wonder of the fog because "poets and painters have taught the loveliness of such effects...They did not exist till Art had invented them."&lt;ref name=McGrath1999 /&gt;

McGrath places the antimimetic philosophy in a tradition of [[Irish literature|Irish writing]], including Wilde and writers such as Synge and [[James Joyce|Joyce]] in a group that "elevate [[wikt:blarney|blarney]] (in the form of linguistic idealism) to aesthetic and philosophical distinction", noting that Terry Eagleton observes an even longer tradition that stretches "as far back in Irish thought as the ninth-century theology of [[John Scottus Eriugena]]" and "the fantastic hyperbole of the ancient sagas".  Wilde's antimimetic idealism, specifically, McGrath describes to be part of the late nineteenth century debate between [[Romanticism]] and [[Realism (arts)|Realism]].&lt;ref name=McGrath1999 /&gt; Wilde's antimimetic philosophy has also had influence on later Irish writers, including [[Brian Friel]].

Halliwell asserts that the idea that life imitates art derives from classical notions that can be traced as far back as the writings of [[Aristophanes of Byzantium]], and does not negate mimesis but rather "displace[s] its purpose onto the artlike fashioning of life itself".  Halliwell draws a parallel between Wilde's philosophy and Aristophanes' famous question about the comedies written by [[Menander]]: "O Menander and Life!  Which of you took the other as your model?", noting, however, that Aristophanes was a precursor to Wilde, and not necessarily espousing the positions that Wilde was later to propound.&lt;ref name=Halliwell2002 /&gt;

In [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s preface to ''[[Three Plays for Puritans|Three Plays]]'' he wrote, "I have noticed that when a certain type of feature appears in painting and is admired as beautiful, it presently becomes common in nature; so that the Beatrices and Francescas in the picture galleries of one generation come to life as the parlor-maids and waitresses of the next." He stated that he created the aristocratic characters in [[Cashel Byron's Profession]] as unrealistically [[wikt:priggish|priggish]] even without his later understanding that "the real world does not exist...men and women are made by their own fancies in the image of the imaginary creatures in my youthful fictions, only much stupider." Shaw, however, disagreed with Wilde on some points. He considered most attempts by life to imitate art to be reprehensible, in part because the art that people generally chose to imitate was idealistic and romanticized.&lt;ref name=Adams1971 /&gt;

[[File:Maxwell's demon.svg|right|310px|thumb|Schematic figure of Maxwell's demon]]

In the [[philosophy of thermal and statistical physics]], '''Maxwell's demon''' is a [[thought experiment]] created by the physicist [[James Clerk Maxwell]] in 1867 in which he suggested how the [[second law of thermodynamics]] might hypothetically be violated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Cargill Gilston Knott |title=Life and Scientific Work of Peter Guthrie Tait |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=1911 |pages=213–215 |chapter=Quote from undated letter from Maxwell to Tait | url=https://archive.org/stream/lifescientificwo00knotuoft#page/212/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the thought experiment, a [[Demon (thought experiment)|demon]] controls a small door between two chambers of gas. As individual gas molecules approach the door, the demon quickly opens and shuts the door so that only fast molecules are passed into one of the chambers, while only slow molecules are passed into the other. Because faster molecules are hotter, the demon's behaviour causes one chamber to warm up and the other to cool down, thereby decreasing [[entropy]] and violating the second law of thermodynamics.   This thought experiment has provoked debate and theoretical work on the relation between thermodynamics and [[information theory]] extending to the present day, with a number of scientists arguing that theoretical considerations rule out any practical device violating the second law in this way.

== Origin and history of the idea ==
The [[thought experiment]] first appeared in a letter [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]] wrote to [[Peter Guthrie Tait]] on 11 December 1867. It appeared again in a letter to [[John William Strutt]] in 1871, before it was presented to the public in Maxwell's 1872 book on [[thermodynamics]] titled ''Theory of Heat''.&lt;ref name=Leff&gt;[[#Leff Rex 02|Leff &amp; Rex (2002)]], p. 370.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his letters and books, Maxwell described the agent opening the door between the chambers as a "finite being". [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson (Lord Kelvin)]] was the first to use the word "demon" for Maxwell's concept, in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in 1874, and implied that he intended the mediating, rather than malevolent, connotation of the word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]] |year=1874 |title=Kinetic theory of the dissipation of energy |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=9 |issue=232 |pages=441–444 |doi=10.1038/009441c0 |bibcode=1874Natur...9..441T}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=1879 |title=The sorting demon Of Maxwell |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Institution|volume=ix |issue=501 |page=113|bibcode=1879Natur..20Q.126. |doi=10.1038/020126a0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Weber&gt;{{cite book |author=Alan S. Weber |year=2000 |title=Nineteenth Century Science: a Selection of Original Texts |publisher=[[Broadview Press]] |page=300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Original thought experiment ==
The second law of thermodynamics ensures (through statistical probability) that two bodies of different [[temperature]], when brought into contact with each other and isolated from the rest of the Universe, will evolve to a thermodynamic equilibrium in which both bodies have approximately the same temperature.&lt;ref name="Bennett87"&gt;{{cite journal

Maxwell conceived a thought experiment as a way of furthering the understanding of the second law. His description of the experiment is as follows:&lt;ref name="Bennett87" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell (1871), reprinted in [[#Leff Rex 90|Leff &amp; Rex (1990)]] on p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|... if we conceive of a being whose faculties are so sharpened that he can follow every molecule in its course, such a being, whose attributes are as essentially finite as our own, would be able to do what is impossible to us. For we have seen that molecules in a vessel full of air at uniform temperature are moving with velocities by no means uniform, though the mean velocity of any great number of them, arbitrarily selected, is almost exactly uniform. Now let us suppose that such a vessel is divided into two portions, ''A'' and ''B'', by a division in which there is a small hole, and that a being, who can see the individual molecules, opens and closes this hole, so as to allow only the swifter molecules to pass from ''A'' to ''B'', and only the slower molecules to pass from ''B'' to ''A''. He will thus, without expenditure of work, raise the temperature of ''B'' and lower that of ''A'', in contradiction to the second law of thermodynamics.}}In other words, Maxwell imagines one container divided into two parts, ''A'' and ''B''.&lt;ref name="Bennett87" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sagawa"&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both parts are filled with the same [[gas]] at equal temperatures and placed next to each other. Observing the [[molecule]]s on both sides, an imaginary [[Demon (thought experiment)|demon]] guards a trapdoor between the two parts. When a faster-than-average molecule from ''A'' flies towards the trapdoor, the demon opens it, and the molecule will fly from ''A'' to ''B''. Likewise, when a slower-than-average molecule from ''B'' flies towards the trapdoor, the demon will let it pass from ''B'' to ''A''. The average [[speed]] of the molecules in ''B'' will have increased while in ''A'' they will have slowed down on average. Since average molecular speed corresponds to temperature, the temperature decreases in ''A'' and increases in ''B'', contrary to the second law of thermodynamics.  A [[heat engine]] operating between the thermal reservoirs ''A'' and ''B'' could extract useful [[work (physics)|work]] from this temperature difference.

The demon must allow molecules to pass in both directions in order to produce only a temperature difference; one-way passage only of faster-than-average molecules from ''A'' to ''B'' will cause higher temperature and pressure to develop on the ''B'' side.

== Criticism and development ==
Several physicists have presented calculations that show that the [[second law of thermodynamics]] will not actually be violated, if a more complete analysis is made of the whole system including the demon.&lt;ref name="Bennett87" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sagawa" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BennettSchumacher"&gt;{{cite journal

That is, it would take more thermodynamic work to gauge the speed of the molecules and selectively allow them to pass through the opening between ''A'' and ''B'' than the amount of [[energy]] gained by the difference of temperature caused by this.

One of the most famous responses to this question was suggested in 1929 by [[Leó Szilárd]],&lt;ref name="Szilard"&gt;{{cite journal

English translation available as [http://aurellem.org/jaynes/sources/Szilard.pdf  NASA document TT F-16723] published 1976&lt;/ref&gt; and later by [[Léon Brillouin]].&lt;ref name="Bennett87" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sagawa" /&gt;  Szilárd pointed out that a real-life Maxwell's demon would need to have some means of measuring molecular speed, and that the act of acquiring information would require an expenditure of energy. Since the demon and the gas are interacting, we must consider the total entropy of the gas and the demon combined. The expenditure of energy by the demon will cause an increase in the entropy of the demon, which will be larger than the lowering of the entropy of the gas.

In 1960, [[Rolf Landauer]] raised an exception to this argument.&lt;ref name="Bennett87" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sagawa" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Landauer"&gt;{{cite journal

He suggested these "reversible" measurements could be used to sort the molecules, violating the Second Law. However, due to [[Entropy in thermodynamics and information theory|the connection between]] thermodynamic entropy and [[information entropy]], this also meant that the recorded measurement must not be erased. In other words, to determine whether to let a molecule through, the demon must acquire information about the state of the molecule and either discard it or store it. Discarding it leads to immediate increase in entropy but the demon cannot store it indefinitely: In 1982, [[Charles H. Bennett (computer scientist)|Charles Bennett]] showed that, however well prepared, eventually the demon will run out of information storage space and must begin to erase the information it has previously gathered.&lt;ref name="Sagawa" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bennett82"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bennett | first1 = C.

Although Bennett had reached the same conclusion as Szilard’s 1929 paper, that a Maxwellian demon could not violate the second law because entropy would be created, he had reached it for different reasons.  Regarding [[Landauer's principle]], the minimum energy dissipated by deleting information was experimentally measured by Eric Lutz ''et al.'' in 2012. Furthermore, Lutz ''et al.'' confirmed that in order to approach the Landauer's limit, the system must asymptotically approach zero processing speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=jobs |url=http://www.nature.com/news/the-unavoidable-cost-of-computation-revealed-1.10186 |title=The unavoidable cost of computation revealed : Nature News &amp; Comment |publisher=Nature.com |date=2012-03-07 |accessdate=2012-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Earman]] and John D. Norton have argued that Szilárd and Landauer's explanations of Maxwell's demon begin by assuming that the [[second law of thermodynamics]] cannot be violated by the demon, and derive further properties of the demon from this assumption, including the necessity of consuming energy when erasing information, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=John Earman  |author2=John D.

Bennett later acknowledged the validity of Earman and Norton's argument, while maintaining that [[Landauer's principle]] explains the mechanism by which real systems do not violate the second law of thermodynamics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Charles H.

== Recent progress ==
Although the argument by Landauer and Bennett only answers the consistency between the second law of thermodynamics and the whole cyclic process of the entire system of a [[Szilard engine]] (a composite system of the engine and the demon), a recent approach based on the [[non-equilibrium thermodynamics]] for small fluctuating systems has provided deeper insight on each information process with each subsystem. From this viewpoint, the measurement process is regarded as a process where the correlation ([[mutual information]]) between the engine and the demon increases, and the feedback process is regarded as a process where the correlation decreases. If the correlation changes, thermodynamic relations as the second law of thermodynamics and the [[fluctuation theorem]] for each subsystem should be modified, and for the case of external control a second-law like inequality&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hugo Touchette  |author2=Seth Lloyd  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2000 |title=Information-Theoretic Limits of Control |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=84 |issue=6  |pages=1156–1159 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.84.1156|bibcode = 2000PhRvL..84.1156T |pmid=11017467|arxiv=chao-dyn/9905039  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a generalized fluctuation theorem&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Takahiro Sagawa  |author2=Masahito Ueda   |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2010 |title=Generalized Jarzynski Equality under Nonequilibrium Feedback Control |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=104 |issue=9   |pages=090602 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.104.090602|pmid=20366975   |arxiv = 0907.4914 |bibcode = 2010PhRvL.104i0602S }}&lt;/ref&gt; with mutual information are satisfied. These relations suggest that we need extra thermodynamic cost to increase correlation (measurement case), and in contrast we can apparently violate the second law up to the consumption of correlation (feedback case). For more general information processes including biological information processing, both inequality&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Armen E Allahverdyan, Dominik Janzing and Guenter Mahler |year=2009 |title=Thermodynamic efficiency of information and heat flow |journal=Journal of Statistical Mechanics |volume=2009 |issue=9 |pages=P09011 |doi=10.1088/1742-5468/2009/09/P09011|arxiv = 0907.3320 |bibcode = 2009JSMTE..09..011A }}&lt;/ref&gt; and equality&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Naoto Shiraishi  |author2=Takahiro Sagawa  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2015 |title=Fluctuation theorem for partially masked nonequilibrium dynamics |journal=Physical Review E |volume=91 |issue=1  |pages=012130 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.91.012130|pmid=25679593  |arxiv = 1403.4018 |bibcode = 2015PhRvE..91a2130S }}&lt;/ref&gt; with mutual information hold.

== Applications ==
Real-life versions of Maxwellian demons occur, but all such "real demons" have their entropy-lowering effects duly balanced by increase of entropy elsewhere. Molecular-sized mechanisms are no longer found only in biology; they are also the subject of the emerging field of [[nanotechnology]]. Single-atom traps used by particle physicists allow an experimenter to control the state of individual quanta in a way similar to Maxwell's demon.

If hypothetical [[mirror matter]] exists, Zurab Silagadze proposes that demons can be envisaged, "which can act like perpetuum mobiles of the second kind: extract heat energy from only one reservoir, use it to do work and be isolated from the rest of ordinary world. Yet the Second Law is not violated because the demons pay their entropy cost in the hidden (mirror) sector of the world by emitting mirror photons."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=physics/0608114 |title=Maxwell's demon through the looking glass |journal=Acta Physica Polonica B |volume=38 |issue=1 |pages=101–126 |year=2007 |last1=Silagadze |first1=Z.

== Experimental work ==
In the February 2007 issue of ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', [[David Leigh (scientist)|David Leigh]], a professor at the [[University of Edinburgh]], announced the creation of a nano-device based on the  [[Brownian ratchet]] popularized by [[Richard Feynman]]. Leigh's device is able to drive a chemical system out of [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]], but it must be powered by an external source ([[light]] in this case) and therefore does not violate thermodynamics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nature05452 | volume=445 | issue=7127 | title=A molecular information ratchet | journal=Nature | pages=523–527 | pmid=17268466 | date=February 2007 | last1 = Serreli | first1 = V | last2 = Lee | first2 = CF | last3 = Kay | first3 = ER | last4 = Leigh | first4 = DA| bibcode=2007Natur.445..523S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Previously, researchers including Nobel Prize winner [[Fraser Stoddart]], created ring-shaped molecules called [[rotaxane]]s which could be placed on an axle connecting two sites, ''A'' and ''B''. Particles from either site would bump into the ring and move it from end to end. If a large collection of these devices were placed in a system, half of the devices had the ring at site ''A'' and half at ''B'', at any given moment in time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bissell|first1=Richard A|last2=Córdova|first2=Emilio|last3=Kaifer|first3=Angel E.|last4=Stoddart|first4=J. Fraser|title=A chemically and electrochemically switchable molecular shuttle|journal=Nature|date=12 May 1994|volume=369|issue=6476|pages=133–137|doi=10.1038/369133a0|bibcode=1994Natur.369..133B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leigh made a minor change to the axle so that if a light is shone on the device, the center of the axle will thicken, restricting the motion of the ring. It only keeps the ring from moving, however, if it is at ''A''. Over time, therefore, the rings will be bumped from ''B'' to ''A'' and get stuck there, creating an imbalance in the system. In his experiments, Leigh was able to take a pot of "billions of these devices" from 50:50 equilibrium to a 70:30 imbalance within a few minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Katharine Sanderson |date=31 January 2007 |title=A demon of a device |publisher=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume= |doi=10.1038/news070129-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 [[Mark G. Raizen]] developed a laser atomic cooling technique which realizes the process Maxwell envisioned of sorting individual atoms in a gas into different containers based on their energy.&lt;ref name="Bennett87" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Raizen2009"&gt;{{cite journal

The operation of the one-way wall relies on an irreversible atomic and molecular process of absorption of a photon at a specific wavelength, followed by spontaneous emission to a different internal state. The irreversible process is coupled to a conservative force created by magnetic fields and/or light. Raizen and collaborators proposed using the one-way wall in order to reduce the entropy of an ensemble of atoms. In parallel, Gonzalo Muga and Andreas Ruschhaupt independently developed a similar concept. Their "atom diode" was not proposed for cooling, but rather for regulating the flow of atoms. The Raizen Group demonstrated significant cooling of atoms with the one-way wall in a series of experiments in 2008. Subsequently, the operation of a one-way wall for atoms was demonstrated by Daniel Steck and collaborators later in 2008. Their experiment was based on the 2005 scheme for the one-way wall, and was not used for cooling. The cooling method realized by the Raizen Group was called "single-photon cooling", because only one photon on average is required in order to bring an atom to near-rest. This is in contrast to other laser cooling techniques which use the momentum of the photon and require a two-level cycling transition.

In 2006, Raizen, Muga, and Ruschhaupt showed in a theoretical paper that as each atom crosses the one-way wall, it scatters one photon, and information is provided about the turning point and hence the energy of that particle. The entropy increase of the radiation field scattered from a directional laser into a random direction is exactly balanced by the entropy reduction of the atoms as they are trapped by the one-way wall.

This technique is widely described as a "Maxwell's demon" because it realizes Maxwell's process of creating a temperature difference by sorting high and low energy atoms into different containers.  However, scientists have pointed out that it is not a true Maxwell's demon in the sense that it does not violate the [[second law of thermodynamics]];&lt;ref name="Bennett87" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Orzel"&gt;{{cite web

This is because the process requires more energy from the laser beams than could be produced by the temperature difference generated.  The atoms absorb low entropy photons from the laser beam and emit them in a random direction, thus increasing the entropy of the environment.&lt;ref name="Bennett87" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Orzel" /&gt;

== As metaphor ==
[[Daemon (computing)|Daemons in computing]], generally processes that run on servers to respond to users, are named for Maxwell's demon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.takeourword.com/TOW146/page4.html|author=[[Fernando J. Corbató]]|title=Take Our Word for It|date=2002-01-23|accessdate=2006-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Henry Brooks Adams]] in his manuscript ''[[The Rule of Phase Applied to History]]'' attempted to use Maxwell's demon as a historical [[metaphor]], though he misunderstood and misapplied the original principle.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cater|Cater (1947)]], pp. 640–647; see also Daub (1970), reprinted in [[#Leff Rex 90|Leff &amp; Rex (1990)]], pp. 37–51.&lt;/ref&gt; Adams interpreted [[history]] as a process moving towards "equilibrium", but he saw [[militarism|militaristic]] nations (he felt [[Germany]] pre-eminent in this class) as tending to reverse this process, a Maxwell's demon of history. Adams made many attempts to respond to the criticism of his formulation from his scientific colleagues, but the work remained incomplete at Adams' death in 1918. It was only published posthumously.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Adams|Adams (1919)]], p. 267.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist [[Pierre Bourdieu]] incorporated Maxwell's demon into his work, "[[Raisons Pratiques]]" as a metaphor for the socioeconomic inequality among students, as maintained by the school system, the economy, and families.

==In fiction==
A machine powered by Maxwell's demon plays a role in [[Thomas Pynchon]]'s novel ''[[The Crying of Lot 49]]''.

The demon is mentioned several times in ''[[The Cyberiad]]'', a series of short stories by the noted science fiction writer [[Stanisław Lem]]. In the book the demon appears both in its original form and in a modified form where it uses its knowledge of all particles in the box in order to surmise general (but unfocused and random) facts about the rest of the universe.

The demon is implied in [[Larry Niven]]'s short story "[[Unfinished Story Nr 2]]", within the context of a world of magic, depending on local concentrations of 'manna', a prerequirement for magic such that magic is no longer possible after manna has been locally depleted.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10695">In [[linguistics]], '''meaning''' is the information or concepts that a sender intends to convey, or does convey, in communication with a receiver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=meaning|website=Dictionary.com Unabridged|publisher=Random House, Inc.|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/meaning|accessdate=December 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.njit.edu/~lipuma/352comproc/comproc.htm|title=Communication Process|author=Nick Sanchez|publisher=New Jersey Institute of Technology|accessdate=January 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The sources of ambiguity ==
{{+rs|date=March 2016}}
Ambiguity means confusion about what is conveyed, since the current context may lead to different interpretations of meaning. Many words in many languages have [[polysemy|multiple definitions]]. Ambiguity is an effect of a rupture of the [[Law of identity|rule of identity]] in the context of the exchange of information. Particularly the ''sender'' may be physically absent, and the contexts explicitly divergent, such as will be the case when the receptor is a reader and the ''sender'' was a writer.

=== Pragmatics ===
{{main|Pragmatics}}

Pragmatics is the study of how context affects meaning.  The two primary forms of context important to pragmatics are [[linguistic context]] and situation context.

Linguistic context is how meaning is understood without relying on intent and assumptions.  In applied pragmatics, for example, meaning is formed through sensory experiences, even though sensory stimulus cannot be easily articulated in language or signs.  Pragmatics, then, reveals that meaning is both something affected by and affecting the world.  Meaning is something contextual with respect to language and the world, and is also something active toward other meanings and the world. Linguistic context becomes important when looking at particular linguistic problems such as that of pronouns.

Situation context refers to every non-linguistic factor that affects the meaning of a phrase. An example of situation context can be seen in the phrase "it's cold in here", which can either be a simple statement of fact or a request to turn up the heat, depending on, among other things, whether or not it is believed to be in the listener's power to affect the temperature.

=== Semantic meaning ===
{{main|Semantics}}

The relationship between words and their referents is called semantic.&lt;ref&gt;https://tr.scribd.com/document/137895627/%D0%92-%D0%9D-%D0%9A%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%81%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2-%D0%9A%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0&lt;/ref&gt; Semantics is the study of how meaning is conveyed through [[sign (semiotics)|sign]]s and [[language]]. Understanding how [[facial expressions]], [[body language]], and [[intonation (linguistics)|tone]] affect meaning, and how words, phrases, sentences, and punctuation relate to meaning are examples. Various subgroups of semantics are studied within the fields of linguistics, logic and [[Semantics (computer science)|computing]]. For example, [[Formal semantics (linguistics)|linguistic semantics]] includes the history of how words have been used in the past; [[Formal semantics (logic)|logical semantics]] includes how people mean and refer in terms of likely intent and assumptions.

During the 19th century, [[John Stuart Mill]] defined semantic meaning with the words "denotation" and "connotation".&lt;ref name="JSM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mill/#LanLog |title=John Stuart Mill |author=Fred Wilson |date=Jan 3, 2002 |work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Stanford |accessdate=October 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A denotation is the literal or primary meaning of a word. Connotations are ideas or feelings that a word invokes for a person in addition to its literal or primary meaning.

The original use of "meaning" as understood early in the 20th century occurred through [[Lady Welby]], after her daughter translated the term "semantics" from French.

=== Conceptual meaning ===
{{main|Concept}}

Languages allow information to be conveyed even when the specific words used are not known by the reader or listener. People connect words with meaning and use words to refer to concepts. A person's intentions affect what is meant. ''Meaning'' (in English) as ''intent'' harkens back to the Anglo-Saxons and is associated today still, with the German verb ''[[wikt:meinen|meinen]]'' as to think or intend.

== Semiotics ==
{{main|Semiotics}}

[[Ferdinand de Saussure]], in founding semiology, his original subset of the semiotics, started describing language in terms of ''Signs'', dividing those ''signs'' in turn into ''signifieds'' and ''signifiers''.  The signifier is the [[perception|perceptive]] side of a sign, thus the [[Hearing|sound]] form in case of oral language.  The signified is the signification ([[semantics|semantic]]) side, the mental construction or image associated with the sound, by either a speaker and hearer. A sign, then, is essentially a relationship between signified and signifier.

Signs are essentially [[conventional]], as any foreign language student is well aware: there is no reason that ''bat'' couldn't mean "body of water" or even "that bust of Napoleon over there". Since the choice of signifiers is ultimately arbitrary, the meaning cannot somehow be ''in'' the signifier. Saussure instead defers meaning to the sign itself: meaning is ultimately the same thing as the sign, and ''meaning'' means that relationship is between signified and signifier. All meaning is both within us and communal, thus [[culture|cultural]]. Signs "mean" by reference to our internal lexicon and grammar, and despite there being a matter of convention, so the communal part, signs also, because of the individual's uniqueness, can mean something only to the individual (what ''red'' means to one person may not be what ''red'' means to another, either in absolute value, or by including what's suggested by the context). However, while meanings carried by one given set of signifiers may vary to some extent from individual to individual, only those meanings that stay within a boundary are seen by other speakers of the language to belong to the language: if one were to refer to smells as red, most other speakers would assume the person is talking nonsense (although statements like this are common among people who experience [[synesthesia]], or in poetry).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3001">In [[mathematics]], a '''near-semiring''' (also ''seminearring'') is an [[abstract algebra|algebraic]] [[algebraic structure|structure]] more general than a [[near-ring]] or a [[semiring]]. Near-semirings arise naturally from [[Function (mathematics)|functions]] on [[monoid]]s.

== Definition ==
A near-semiring is a set ''S'' with two binary operations "+" and "·", and a constant 0 such that (''S''; +; 0) is a [[monoid]] (not necessarily commutative), (''S''; ·) is a semigroup, these structures are related by one (right or left) [[distributive law]], and accordingly the 0 is one (right or left, respectively) side [[absorbing element]].

Formally, an algebraic structure (''S''; +, ·, 0) is said to be a near-semiring if it satisfies the following axioms:

# (''S''; +, 0) is a monoid,
# (''S''; ·) is a semigroup,
# (''a'' + ''b'') · ''c'' = ''a'' · ''c'' + ''b'' · ''c'', for all ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' in ''S'', and
# 0 · ''a'' = 0 for all ''a'' in ''S''. 

Near-semirings are a common abstraction of semirings and near-rings [Golan, 1999; Pilz, 1983]. The standard examples of near-semirings are typically of the form ''M''(Г), the set of all mappings on a monoid (Г; +, 0), equipped with composition of mappings, pointwise addition of mappings, and the constantly 0 function. Subsets of ''M''(Г) closed under the operations provide further examples of near-semirings. Another example is the ordinals under the usual operations of [[ordinal arithmetic]] (here Clause 3 should be replaced with its symmetric form ''c'' · (''a'' + ''b'')  =  ''c'' · ''a'' + ''c'' · ''b''. Strictly speaking, the [[Class (set theory)|class]] of all ordinals is not a set, so the above example should be more appropriately called a ''class near-semiring''. We get a near-semiring in the standard sense if we restrict to those ordinals strictly less than some [[Additively indecomposable ordinal|multiplicatively indecomposable ordinal]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11254">'''Parentification''' is the process of role reversal whereby a child is obliged to act as parent to their ''own'' parent. In extreme cases, the child is used to fill the void of the [[Parental Alienation|alienating parent]]'s emotional life.&lt;ref&gt;R. A. Gardner et al., ''The International Handbook of Parental Alienation Syndrome'' (2006) p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;

Two distinct modes of parentification have been identified technically: instrumental parentification and emotional parentification. Instrumental parentification involves the child completing physical tasks for the family, such as looking after a sick relative, paying bills, or providing assistance to younger siblings that would normally be provided by a parent. Emotional parentification occurs when a child or adolescent must take on the role of a confidant or mediator for (or between) parents or family members.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory J. Jurkovic, 'Destructive Parentification in Families' in Luciano L'Abate ed., ''Family Psychopathology'' (New York 1998) pp. 237–255&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Melitta Schmideberg]] noted in 1948 how emotional deprivation could lead parents to treat their children (unconsciously) as substitute parent figures.&lt;ref&gt;Jurkovic, p. 240&lt;/ref&gt; "Spousification" and "parental child" ([[Minuchin]]) offered alternative concepts exploring the same phenomenon; while the theme of intergenerational continuity in such violations of [[personal boundaries]] was further examined.&lt;ref&gt;Jurkovic, in L'Abate ed., p. 240&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Eric Berne]] touched on the dangers of parents and children having a symmetrical, rather than asymmetrical relationship, as when an absent spouse is replaced by the eldest child;&lt;ref&gt;Eric Berne, ''Sex in Human Loving'' (Penguin 1970) p. 249–53&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Virginia Satir]] wrote of "the role-function discrepancy...where the son gets into a head-of-the-family role, commonly that of the father".&lt;ref&gt;Virginia Satir, ''Peoplemaking'' (1983) p. 167&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Object relations theory]] highlighted how the child's [[True self and false self|false self]] is called into being when it is forced prematurely to take excessive care of the parental object;&lt;ref&gt;Adam Phillips, ''On Kissing, Tickling and Being Bored'' (1994) p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John Bowlby]] looked at what he called "compulsive caregiving" among the anxiously [[Attachment theory|attached]], as a result of a parent inverting the normal relationship and pressuring the child to be an attachment figure for them.&lt;ref&gt;John Bowlby, ''The Making and Breaking of Affectional Bonds'' (London 1979) p. 137–38&lt;/ref&gt;

All such aspects of disturbed and inverted parenting patterns have been drawn under the umbrella of the wider phenomenon of parentification – with the result (critics suggest) that on occasion "ironically the concept of parentification has...been as over-burdened as the child it often describes".&lt;ref&gt;Karpel, quoted by Jurkovic, in L'Abate ed., p. 238&lt;/ref&gt;

==Choice of child==
For practical reasons, elder children are generally chosen for the familial "parental" role – very often  the first-born children who were put in the anomalous role.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Satir, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; However, gender considerations mean that sometimes the eldest boy or eldest girl was selected, even if they are not the oldest child overall, for such reasons as the preference to match the sex of the missing parent.

Thus where there is a disabled child in the family to be cared for, "older siblings, especially girls, are at the greatest risk of parentification";&lt;ref&gt;Bryna Siegal, ''What about Me'' (2002) p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; where a father-figure is missing, it may be the eldest son who is forced to take on his father's responsibilities, without ever obtaining the autonomy that normally accompanies such adult roles.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Bloom, ''Tennessee Williams's The Glass Menagerie'' (2007) p. 142&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively a widower may put a daughter into the social and emotional role of his deceased wife – "spousification"; or a mother can oblige her daughter to play the caring role, in a betrayal of the child's normal expectation of love and care.&lt;ref&gt;Diana Brandt, ''Wild Mother Dancing'' (1993) p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;

==Narcissistic==
[[Narcissistic]] parentification occurs when a child is forced to take on the parent's idealised [[Psychological projection|projection]], something which encourages a compulsive [[perfectionism (psychology)|perfectionism]] in the child at the expense of their natural development.&lt;ref&gt;Jurkovic, in  L'Abate, ed., p. 246-7&lt;/ref&gt; In a kind of pseudo-identification, the child is induced by any and all means to take on the characteristics of the parental [[ego ideal]]&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of the Neuroses'' (London 1946) p. 510-11&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; a pattern that has been detected in [[Western world|western]] culture since [[Homer]]'s description of the character of [[Achilles]].&lt;ref&gt;R. K. Holway, ''Becoming Achilles'' (2011) Chapter Five 'Fathers and Sons'; and notes p. 218–19&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disadvantages and advantages==
The almost inevitable byproduct of parentification is losing one's own childhood.&lt;ref&gt;Siegal, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; In destructive parentification, the child in question takes on excessive responsibility in the family, without their caretaking being acknowledged and supported by others:&lt;ref&gt;Jurkovic, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt; by adopting the role of parental care-giver, the child loses their real place in the family unit and is left lonely and unsure.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In extreme instances, there may be what has been called a kind of disembodiment, a [[narcissistic wound]] that threatens one's basic self-identity.&lt;ref&gt;Paula M. Reeves, in Nancy D. Chase, ''Burdened Children'' (1999) p. 171&lt;/ref&gt;

In later life, parentified children often  experience  anxiety  over  abandonment  and  loss,  and demonstrate  difficulty  handling  rejection  and  disappointment  within  interpersonal  relationships. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Katz |first1=Petracca |last2=J. |first2=Rabinowitz |title=A    retrospective study of daughters’ emotional role reversal  with parents, attachment anxiety, excessive reassurance seeking, and depressive symptoms. |journal=The American Journal of Family Therapy |date=2009 |volume=37 |page=185-195 |doi=10.1080/01926180802405596 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, not all results of parentification may be negative. Some studies have hypothesized that when a child is the subject of parentification, it might sometimes result in the child, later in life, having greater [[psychological resilience]], more [[individuation]], a clearer sense of self, and more secure attachment styles during adulthood. These characteristics may be because the person had to adapt to changes and take on responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;Hooper, L. M., Marotta, S. A., &amp; Lanthier, R. P. (2008). Predictors of growth and distress following childhood parentification: A retrospective exploratory study. ''Journal of Child and Family Studies, 17(5)'', 693-705. {{doi|10.1007/s10826-007-9184-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crosscultural studies also point to the widespread nature of the practice of parentification, and indicate that normal as well as pathological aspects of parentification need to be taken into account.&lt;ref&gt;Nancy D. Shape, ''Burdened Children'' (1999) p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

==Case studies==
* [[Carl Jung]] in his late autobiography reports that his mother always spoke to him as an adult, confiding in him what she could not share with her husband.&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Jung, ''Memories, Dreams, Reflections'' (London 1983) p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; [[Laurens van der Post]] commented on the grown-up atmosphere surrounding the young Jung, and considered that "this activation of the pattern of the "old man" within himself...was all a consequence of the extent to which his father and mother failed each other".&lt;ref&gt;Laurens van der Post, ''Jung and the Story of Our Times'' (Penguin 1978) p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Patrick Casement]] reports on a patient – Mr T – whose mother was distressed at any and all his feelings, and who therefore protected her from them – mothering ''her'' himself.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Casement, ''Further Learning from the Patient'' (1990) p. 174&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary examples==
''[[The Tale of Genji]]'' tells that for "Kaoru's mother...her son's visits were her chief pleasure. Sometimes he almost seemed more like a father than a son – a fact which he was aware of and thought rather sad".&lt;ref&gt;Murasaki Shikiki, ''The Tale of Genji'' (London 1992) p. 790&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles Dickens' "Angel in the house" characters, particularly Agnes Wickfield in ''[[David Copperfield]]'', are parentified children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dickensblog.typepad.com/dickensblog/2010/09/unwilling-angels-charles-dickens-agnes-wickfield-and-the-effects-of-parentification.html Nina S. "Unwilling Angels: Charles Dickens, Agnes Wickfield, and the Effects of Parentification". Dickens Blog.]&lt;/ref&gt; Agnes is forced to be the parent of her alcoholic father and seems to strive for perfection as a means of reaching the "ego ideal" of her deceased mother (who died upon child-birth). Agnes marries late, has relationship and intimacy problems (she has a hard time expressing her love for David until he reveals his own love for her), and has some self-defeating attitudes; in one scene she blames her own father's misfortunes on herself. However, she proves to be resilient, resourceful, responsible and even potentially career-driven (she forms her own school). She also manages to marry the protagonist David and the two live happily together for 10 years with children by the end of the novel.

The theme of parentification has also been explored in the [[Twilight (novel series)|''Twilight'' series]],&lt;ref&gt;E. D. Klonsky/A. Blas, ''The Psychology of Twilight'' (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; with particular (but not exclusive) reference to the character of [[Bella Swan]].&lt;ref&gt;Nancy R. Reagin ed., ''Twilight and History'' 
(2010) p. 184–85 and p. 258-9&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20685">The '''parol evidence rule''' is a rule in the [[Common law|Anglo-American common law]] regarding [[contracts]], and governs what kinds of evidence parties to a contract dispute can introduce to identify the specific terms of a contract.{{sfnp|Scott|Kraus|2013|p=539}}  The rule prevents parties who have reduced their agreement to a final written document from later introducing other evidence, such as the content of oral discussions from earlier in the negotiation process, as evidence of a different intent as to the terms of the contract.{{sfnp|Scott|Kraus|2013|p=537}}  The term "parol" derives from the [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman French]] ''parol'' or ''parole'', meaning "word of mouth" or "verbal", and in medieval times referred to oral pleadings in a court case.&lt;ref&gt;"Parol", ''Black's Law Dictionary'', 10th ed. (2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

The supporting rationale for this rule is that since the contracting parties have reduced their agreement to a single and final writing, extrinsic evidence of past agreements or terms should not be considered when interpreting that writing, as the parties had decided to ultimately leave them out of the contract. In other words, one may not use evidence made prior to the written contract to contradict the writing. A common misconception is that it is a rule of evidence (like the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]]), but that is not the case.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17812765538668910988 Casa Herrera, Inc. v. Beydoun]'', 32 Cal. 4th 336, 9 Cal. Rptr. 3d 97, 83 P.3d 497 (2004).  This case reaffirmed that the parol evidence rule is a substantive rule of law and not a mere procedural or evidentiary defense, and then held on that basis that a dismissal of a case on the basis of the parol evidence rule is a favorable termination on the merits sufficient to support a subsequent action for [[malicious prosecution]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
{{Contract law}}

The rule applies to parol evidence, as well as other extrinsic evidence (such as written correspondence that does not form a separate contract) regarding a contract.  If a contract is in writing and final to at least one term (integrated), parol or extrinsic evidence will generally be excluded.&lt;ref name=Codelfa&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|24|1982|litigants=[[Codelfa Construction Pty Ltd v State Rail Authority of NSW]] |parallelcite=(1982) 149 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 337 |courtname=auto |date=11 May 1982}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p 347}} However, there are a number of exceptions to this general rule, including for partially integrated contracts, agreements with separate consideration, to resolve ambiguities, or to establish contract defenses.

To take an example, Carl agrees in writing to sell Betty a car for $1,000, but later, Betty argues that Carl earlier told her that she would only need to pay Carl $800.  The parol evidence rule would generally prevent Betty from testifying to this alleged conversation because the testimony ($800) would directly contradict the written contract's terms ($1,000).

In order for the rule to be effective, the contract in question must first be a final integrated writing; it must, in the judgment of the court, be the final agreement between the parties (as opposed to a mere draft, for example).

A final agreement is either a partial or complete integration, provided that it has an agreement on its face indicating its finality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Corbin |first1=Arthur L. |title=The Interpretation of Words and the Parol Evidence Rule |volume=50 |journal=[[Cornell Law Quarterly]] |publisher=[[Cornell Law School]] |page=161 |year=1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If it contains some, but not all, of the terms as to which the parties have agreed then it is a partial integration. This means that the writing was a final agreement between the parties (and not mere preliminary negotiations) as to some terms, but not as to others. On the other hand, if the writing were to contain all of the terms as to which the parties agreed, then it would be a complete integration. One way to ensure that the contract will be found to be a final and complete integration is through the inclusion of a [[merger clause]], which recites that the contract is, in fact, the whole agreement between the parties.  However, many modern cases have found merger clauses to be only a [[rebuttable presumption]].

The importance of the distinction between partial and complete integrations is relevant to what evidence is excluded under the parol evidence rule. For both complete and partial integrations, evidence contradicting the writing is excluded under the parol evidence rule. However, for a partial integration, terms that supplement the writing are admissible. To put it mildly, this can be an extremely subtle (and subjective) distinction.

To put it simply, (1) If the parties intend a complete integration of the contract terms, no parol evidence within the scope of agreement is permitted. (2) If the parties intended a partial integrated agreement, no parol evidence that contradicts anything integrated is permitted. And (3), if the parol evidence is collateral, meaning it regards a different agreement, and does not contradict the integrated terms, and are not terms any reasonable person would always naturally integrate, then the rule does not apply and the evidence is admissible.

In a minority of U.S. states, (Florida, Colorado, and Wisconsin), the parol evidence rule is extremely strong and extrinsic evidence is always barred from being used to interpret a contract. This is called the [[Four Corners (law)|Four Corners Rule]], and it is traditional/old. In a Four Corners Rule jurisdiction, there are two basic rules. First, the court will never allow parol evidence if the parties intended a full and completely integrated agreement, and second, the court will only turn to parol evidence if the terms available are wholly ambiguous. The policy is to prevent lying, to protect against doubtful veracity, to enable parties to rely dearly on written contracts, and for judicial efficiency.

In most jurisdictions there are numerous exceptions to this rule, and in those jurisdictions, extrinsic evidence may be admitted for the following purposes. This is called the Admission Rule. It favors liberalizing the admission of evidence to determine if the contract was  fully integrated and to determine if the parol evidence is relevant. In these jurisdictions, such as California, one can bring in parol evidence even if the contract is unambiguous on its face, if the parol evidence creates ambiguity. The policy is to get to the actual truth.

The third and final admissibility rule is that under the UCC § 2-202: Parol evidence cannot contradict a writing intended to be the "final expression" of the agreement integrated but may be explained or supplemented by (a) a course of dealing/usage of trade/ course of performance, and by (b) evidence of consistent additional terms unless the writing was also intended to be a complete and exclusive statement of the terms of the agreement.

* The court may first determine if the agreement was in fact totally reduced to a written document. In the case of ''State Rail Authority of New South Wales v Heath Outdoor Pty Ltd'' [[Michael McHugh (judge)|McHugh J]] held the parol evidence rule has 'no operation until it is first determined' that all the terms of the contract are in writing.&lt;ref name="SRA v Heath"&gt;''State Rail Authority of New South Wales v Heath Outdoor Pty Ltd'' (1986) 7 [[NSW Law Reports|NSWLR]] 170 at 191, [[NSW Court of Appeal]] [http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=7+NSWLR+170 LawCite records].&lt;/ref&gt;
* In Australia, the case of ''Saleh v Romanous'', it was held that equitable estoppel triumphs common law rules of parol evidence.&lt;ref name="Saleh v Romanous"&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWCA|373|2010|litigants=Saleh v Romanous |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  
* To prove the parties to a contract. A written agreement to sell land signed by Mrs Kenny at times made reference to Mr Kenny, and the court held that oral evidence was admissible and that she was signing for herself and as an agent for her husband.&lt;ref name="Gilberto v Kenny"&gt;''Gilberto v Kenny'' (1983) 155 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 691  (15 February 1983) [[High Court of Australia|High Court]] (Australia).&lt;/ref&gt;
* To prove a condition precedent. In ''Pym v Campbell'' (1865) 119 ER 903, Pym entered into a written contract with Campbell to sell an interest in an invention. The court allowed Campbell to include the oral terms of acknowledgement that the sale was subject to an inspection and approval by an engineer.  The engineer did not approve the invention.
* To prove that the written document is only part of the contract as in ''[[Hospital Products Ltd v United States Surgical Corporation]]'',&lt;ref name="Hospital Products  HCA"&gt;{{Cite AustLII|HCA|64|1984|litigants=[[Hospital Products Ltd v United States Surgical Corporation]] |parallelcite=(1984) 156 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 41 |date=25 October 1984 |courtname=[[High Court of Australia|High Court]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; where the court found for a written contract to be only part of an agreement. In ''State Rail Authority of NSW'' v Heath Outdoor Pty Ltd the court held that the parol evidence rule is persuasive and the evidenciary burden is on the party wishing to establish that the whole contract was not in writing.&lt;ref name="SRA v Heath"/&gt;
* To prove that an implied term of custom or trade usage or past dealings is part of a contract even if not in a written agreement, as in ''[[Hutton v Warren]]''[[Hutton v Warren| [1836] 1 M and W 466]], where the party wishing to add the term bears the evidenciary burden and in this case, a lease had to be read in the light of established custom.
* To prove what is true consideration, not something added to avoid taxes.
* To prove the term or promise is part of a [[collateral contract]].&lt;ref name="Hoyt's Pty Ltd v Spencer"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|64|1919|litigants=Hoyt's Pty Ltd v Spencer |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1919/64.pdf (1919) 27 {{abbr|CLR|Commonwealth Law Reports}} 133] |courtname=auto |date=24 November 1919}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* To aid in the interpretation of existing terms.&lt;ref name=Codelfa/&gt;
* To resolve ambiguity using the ''[[contra proferentem]]'' rule.
* To show, particularly in [[California]], that (1) in light of all the circumstances surrounding the making of the contract, the contract is actually ambiguous (regardless of whether the contract's meaning appears unambiguous at first glance), (2) thus necessitating the use of extrinsic evidence to determine its ''actual'' meaning.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3574754840919265063 Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. Co. v. G. W. Thomas Drayage Co.]'', 69 Cal. 2d 33, 39, 69 Cal. Rptr. 561, 442 P.2d 641  (1968). ''Pacific Gas &amp; Electric'' is one of [[Roger Traynor]]'s most famous (and controversial) opinions, which has been criticized by a number of prominent jurists, including Judge [[Alex Kozinski]] of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.  See ''Trident Center v. Connecticut Gen. Life Ins. Co.'', 847 F.2d 564 (9th Cir. 1988) and Jeffrey W. Stempel, ''Stempel on Insurance Contracts'', 3rd ed., § 4.02, 4-9, n.16 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;
* To disprove the validity of the contract.
* To show that an unambiguous term in the contract is in fact a mistaken transcription of a prior valid agreement. Such a claim must be established by [[clear and convincing evidence]], and not merely by the [[preponderance of the evidence]].
* To correct [[Error|mistakes]].
* To show wrongful conduct such as [[misrepresentation]], [[fraud]], [[duress]], unconscionability (276 N.E.2d 144, 147), or illegal purpose on the part of one or both parties.&lt;ref name=Wollner1999/&gt;
* To show that [[consideration]] has not actually been paid. For example, if the contract states that A has paid B $1,000 in exchange for a painting, B can introduce evidence that A had never actually conveyed the $1,000.
* To identify the parties, especially if the parties have changed names.
* To imply or incorporate a term of the contract.&lt;ref name="Codelfa"/&gt;
* To make changes in the contract after the original final contract has been agreed to. That is, oral statements can be admitted unless they are barred by a clause in the written contract.&lt;ref name=Wollner1999&gt;Wollner KS. (1999). How to Draft and Interpret Insurance Policies, p 10. Casualty Risk Publishing LLC.&lt;/ref&gt;

In order for evidence to fall within this rule, it must involve either (1) a written or oral communication made prior to execution of the written contract; or (2) an oral communication made contemporaneous with execution of the written contract. Evidence of a ''later'' communication will not be barred by this rule, as it is admissible to show a later modification of the contract (although it might be inadmissible for some other reason, such as the [[Statute of frauds]]). Similarly, evidence of a collateral agreement - one that would naturally and normally be included in a separate writing - will not be barred. For example, if A contracts with B to paint B's house for $1,000, B can introduce extrinsic evidence to show that A also contracted to paint B's storage shed for $100. The agreement to paint the shed would logically be in a separate document from the agreement to paint the house.

Though its name suggests that it is a procedural evidence rule, the consensus of courts and commentators is that the parol evidence rule constitutes substantive contract law.

Additional information on the parol evidence rule may be found in Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 213.

==Examples==
The parol evidence rule is a common trap for consumers. For example:

* Health club contracts.  You enroll in a health club, and the salesperson tells you that the contract can be cancelled.  You later decide you would like to cancel, but the written contract provides that it is non-cancellable.  The oral promises of the salesperson are generally non-enforceable.  However, the salesperson in misleading you into the terms of the contract constitutes a misrepresentation and you may seek to rescind the contract.
* Auto sales agreements.  You purchase a used car, and the salesperson tells you it is "good as new", but the contract provides that the sale is [[as is]].  Again, in most circumstances the written contract controls.  However, this may constitute misrepresentation if it exceeds reasonably accepted "puffing" or "dealers' talk".&lt;ref&gt;''Vulcan Metals Co. v. Simmons Mfg. Co.'', 248 F. 853, 856 (2d Cir. 1918).&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Timeshare]]s.  While in certain jurisdictions, and in certain circumstances, a consumer may have a right of [[Rescission (contract law)|rescission]], some people attend real estate sales presentations at which they may feel pressured into immediately signing binding contracts.  Evidence that the contract was entered into under duress will not be precluded by the parol evidence rule.

==Specific jurisdictions==
'''Australia'''
* In New South Wales, if an entire agreement clause,&lt;ref name=Codelfa/&gt; does not exist in the contract terms, parol evidence rule is a default rule of a completely written contract that the admission of extrinsic evidence is not allowed, and the contract should be understood in an objective approach.&lt;ref name="Mount Bruce Mining"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|37|2015|litigants=Mount Bruce Mining Pty Limited v Wright Prospecting Pty Limited |courtname=auto |date=14 October 2015 |parallelcite=(2015) 256 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 104}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* However there are two exceptions that could overcome the parol evidence rule that extrinsic evidence is admissible: 
Exception 1: the contract is an oral contract or partly written.
Exception 2: parties may have entered into a collateral contract,&lt;ref name="Hoyt's Pty Ltd v Spencer"/&gt; or are establishing an estoppel,&lt;ref name="Saleh v Romanous"/&gt; with rectification, condition precedent, the true consideration, ACL, implied terms.

* There are also exceptions to the parol evidence rule in construing a contract. The first exception is that there is evidence of trade usage, which is well-known, uniform and certain.

This necessarily implies consideration of surrounding circumstances and indicates a broader approach may be adopted by the court in the future.

'''South Africa'''
*In [[South Africa]] the [[Supreme Court of Appeal of South Africa|Supreme Court of Appeal]], beginning with the landmark ruling in ''KPMG Chartered Accountants (SA) v Securefin Ltd'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZASCA/2009/7.html (2009) 2 All SA 523 (SCA)] par 39.&lt;/ref&gt; redefined the rules relating to the admissibility of evidence that may be used in the interpretation of [[contracts]] in [[South Africa]] and in ''Dexgroup (Pty) Ltd v Trustco Group International (Pty) Ltd'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZASCA/2013/120.html 2013 6 SA 520 (SCA).]&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court of Appeal gave further clarity on these rules. The starting point is the language of the document and the parol evidence rule prevents evidence to add to, detract from or modify the words contained in the document. However, evidence to prove the meaning of the words, expressions, sentences and terms that constitute the contract, is admissible from the outset irrespective of whether there is any uncertainty or ambiguity in the text – as long as the evidence concerned points to a meaning which the text can reasonably have and the evidence is relevant to prove the common intention of the parties.&lt;ref&gt;Cornelius, Steve [https://www.academia.edu/11379276/Redefining_the_Rules_for_the_Admissibility_of_Evidence_in_the_Interpretation_of_Contracts Redefining the Rules for the Admissibility of Evidence in the Interpretation of Contracts] 2014 De Jure 363.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4349">In [[mathematics]], specifically in the study of [[ordinary differential equation]]s, the '''Peano existence theorem''', '''Peano theorem''' or '''Cauchy–Peano theorem''', named after [[Giuseppe Peano]] and [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy]], is a fundamental [[theorem]] which guarantees the [[existence]] of solutions to certain [[initial value problem]]s.

==History==
Peano first published the theorem in 1886 with an incorrect proof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=G. |last=Peano |title=Sull’integrabilità delle equazioni differenziali del primo ordine |journal=Atti Accad. Sci. Torino |volume=21 |year=1886 |pages=437–445 |url=https://archive.org/stream/attidellaraccade21real#page/436/mode/2up/search/peano }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1890 he published a new correct proof using successive approximations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=G. |last=Peano |title=Demonstration de l’intégrabilité des équations différentielles ordinaires |journal=[[Mathematische Annalen]] |volume=37 |issue=2 |year=1890 |pages=182–228 |doi=10.1007/BF01200235 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theorem==
Let ''D'' be an [[open subset|open]] subset of '''R''' × '''R''' with
:&lt;math&gt;f\colon D \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;
a continuous function and
:&lt;math&gt;y'(x) = f\left(x,y(x)\right)&lt;/math&gt;
a [[continuous function|continuous]], [[explicit ordinary differential equation|explicit]] [[first-order differential equation]] defined on ''D'', then every initial value problem
:&lt;math&gt;y\left(x_0\right) = y_0&lt;/math&gt;
for ''f'' with &lt;math&gt;(x_0, y_0) \in D&lt;/math&gt;
has a local solution
:&lt;math&gt;z\colon I \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is a [[neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighbourhood]] of &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;,
such that &lt;math&gt; z'(x) = f\left(x,z(x)\right) &lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt; x \in I &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Coddington|Levinson|1955|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The solution need not be unique: one and the same initial value (''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) may give rise to many different solutions ''z''.

==Related theorems==
The Peano theorem can be compared with another existence result in the same context, the [[Picard–Lindelöf theorem]]. The Picard–Lindelöf theorem both assumes more and concludes more. It requires [[Lipschitz continuity]], while the Peano theorem requires only continuity; but it proves both existence and uniqueness where the Peano theorem proves only the existence of solutions. To illustrate, consider the [[ordinary differential equation]]

:&lt;math&gt;y' = \left\vert y\right\vert^{\frac{1}{2}}&lt;/math&gt; on the domain &lt;math&gt; \left[0, 1\right].&lt;/math&gt;

According to the Peano theorem, this equation has solutions, but the Picard–Lindelöf theorem does not apply since the right hand side is not Lipschitz continuous in any neighbourhood containing 0. Thus we can conclude existence but not uniqueness. It turns out that this ordinary differential equation has two kinds of solutions when starting at &lt;math&gt;y(0)=0&lt;/math&gt;, either &lt;math&gt;y(x)=0&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;y(x)=x^2/4&lt;/math&gt;. The transition between &lt;math&gt;y=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y=(x-C)^2/4&lt;/math&gt; can happen at any C.

The [[Carathéodory's existence theorem|Carathéodory existence theorem]] is a generalization of the Peano existence theorem with weaker conditions than continuity.

Following the work of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], [[Karl Marx]] outlined the workings of a '''political consciousness'''.

==The politics of consciousness==
[[Consciousness]] typically refers to the idea of a being who is self-aware.  It is a distinction often reserved for human beings.  This remains the original and most common usage of the term.  &lt;ref&gt;But a line of political and philosophical inquiry opened up which explores consciousness in terms of one's  political state of mind.&lt;/ref&gt; For Marx, consciousness describes a person's political sense of self.  That is, consciousness describes a person's awareness of politics.  For Marx, an authentic consciousness was linked to understanding one's true position in History.  While Hegel placed God behind the workings of consciousness in people, Marx saw the [[political economy]] as the engine of mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/c/o.htm |title=Glossary of Terms: Co |publisher=Marxists.org |date= |accessdate=2012-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th century, many social movements and intellectuals have developed this use of consciousness.

==False consciousness==
{{Main|False consciousness}}
In Marx's view, consciousness was always political, for it was always the outcome of politic-economic circumstances.  What one thinks of life, power, and self, for Marx, is always a product of ideological forces.

For Marx, ideologies appear to explain and justify the current distribution of wealth and power in a society.  In societies with unequal allocations of wealth and power, ideologies present these inequalities as acceptable, virtuous, inevitable, and so forth.  Ideologies thus tend to lead people to accept the status quo.  The subordinate people come to believe in their subordination: the peasants to accept the rule of the aristocracy, the factory workers to accept the rule of the owners, consumers the rule of corporations. This belief in one's own subordination, which comes about through ideology, is, for Marx, [[false consciousness]].

That is, conditions of inequality create ideologies which confuse people about their true aspirations, loyalties, and purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01a.htm ''The German ideology'', Part 1]&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, for example, the [[working class]] has often been, for Marx, beguiled by nationalism, organized religion, and other distractions.  These ideological devices help to keep people from realizing that it is they who produce wealth, they who deserve the fruits of the land, all who can prosper: instead of literally thinking for themselves, they think the thoughts given to them by the ruling class.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ch02.htm ''The Communist Manifesto'', ch. 2].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consciousness and the political-economy==

For Marx, consciousness is a reflection of the political economy.  A person's thoughts tend to be shaped by his or her political and economic circumstances.  He famously wrote, "It is not the consciousness of men that determines their being, but, on the contrary, their social being that determines their consciousness."

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Perhaps Marx's greatest contribution to modern thought... is his comprehensive investigation into the role of Ideology, or how social being determines consciousness, which results in certain (for the most part unconscious) belief and value systems depending on the particular economic infrastructure pertaining at the time. From a Marxian point of view all cultural artifacts--religious systems, philosophical positions, ethical values--are, naturally enough, products of consciousness and as such are subject to these ideological pressures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.victorianweb.org/philosophy/phil2.html Sullivan, Robert. The Victorian Web]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Consciousness and social movements==

Many [[social movements]] have loosely followed Marx's thinking on consciousness.  Attaining consciousness, many believe, means finding one's ''true'' historical path, as opposed to the propaganda dispensed by the ruling elites.  Thus, the [[feminist movement]] spoke of [[consciousness raising]] and many South African activists have subscribe to a [[Black Consciousness Movement]], which calls upon Blacks to pursue their "true" political trajectory (as opposed to the ideas set out by, for example, the [[apartheid]] regime).  In the latter example, for many South African Blacks, consciousness meant rejecting racist ideas about Blacks, rejecting White rule of the nation, and restoring Black identity, history, and power.

In a politically charged sense, becoming "politically conscious" is often meant to connote that people have awakened to their ''true'' political role, their ''actual'' identity.  For Marx, this meant that the working classes would become conscious of themselves as the agents of history--they would unite and share in the wealth of labor.  This, for Marx, was their historical role and their right (as opposed to working for wages, fighting wars on behalf of capitalists, and so forth).  For many African Americans, "consciousness" has meant identifying and discrediting forms of [[White supremacy]], including those internalized by Blacks.  In these uses of the term "consciousness" is truth or destiny.  These uses of political consciousness are often politically charged.  Does, for example, a Black woman lack consciousness because she generally supports a system run mostly by White male capitalists?  If she became politically conscious would she think differently?  What is her "true" consciousness supposed to look like?

Many marxists, feminists, African Americans (and other groups), have ceased to argue that there is one true form of consciousness.  Instead, while preserving a sense that the ruling class perpetuates a [[dominant ideology]] and often behaves in ways which harm people, many dissenters now hold a more liberal position which tolerates a variety of political positions.  The complexities of political consciousness are described by the theories of [[cultural hegemony]].

'''Ralph Mark Gilbert''' (March 17, 1899, [[Jacksonville, Florida]] - August 23, 1956, [[New York City]]) was an American [[Civil rights movement|civil rights]] leader and a [[Progressive National Baptist Convention|Baptist]] minister.

==Religious Ministry==
From 1939 until his death in 1956, he was the Pastor of the [[First African Baptist Church (Savannah)|First African Baptist Church]], located at
23 Montgomery Street on Franklin Square in [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]]'s Historic District.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oldestblackchurch.org/html/body_r.gilbert.htm Reverend Ralph Mark Gilbert, First African Baptist Church, Savannah]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil Rights==

From 1942 to 1950, Gilbert served as president of the Savannah Branch of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP)]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sip.armstrong.edu/CivilRightsMuseum/info.html The Ralph Mark Gilbert Civil Rights Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; Under his tenure, the local chapter was reorganized, hundreds of [[African-American|Blacks]] were registered to vote, a progressive white [[Democratic Party of the United States|Democratic]] politician, [[John G. Kennedy]], became [[Mayors of Savannah, Georgia|Mayor of Savannah]] and the city's Police Department hired its first Black police officers, known as the ''Original Nine''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.savannahnow.com/node/330229 Son of city's 10th black police officer pens book, Adam Crisp, Savannah Morning News, July 23, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Reverend Gilbert died August 23, 1956 while on vacation in New York City, New York.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Savannah Tribune, August 30, 1956, page 1 and Savannah Morning News, August 28, 1956, page 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;

==Honors==
Savannah's [[Ralph Mark Gilbert Civil Rights Museum]] is named in honor of Dr. Gilbert. The museum is located at 460 Martin Luther King, Jr. Blvd.in the Wage Earners Bank building constructed in 1914. Renovation of the building began in 1993 to house the museum and opened as Ralph Mark Gilbert Civil Rights Museum in 1996.

'''Raymond Claude Ferdinand Aron''' ({{IPA-fr|ʁɛmɔ̃ aʁɔ̃|lang}}; 14 March 1905 – 17 October 1983) was a French [[Philosophy|philosopher]], [[Sociology|sociologist]], [[Political science|political scientist]], and [[journalism|journalist.]]

He is best known for his 1955 book ''[[The Opium of the Intellectuals]]'', the title of which inverts [[Karl Marx]]'s claim that religion was the [[opium of the people]] &amp;ndash; Aron argues that in post-war France, [[Marxism]] was the opium of the intellectuals. In the book, Aron chastised French intellectuals for what he described as their harsh criticism of [[capitalism]] and [[democracy]] and their simultaneous defense of Marxist oppression, atrocities, and intolerance. Critic [[Roger Kimball]]&lt;ref&gt;Kimball, Roger (2001). "[http://www.newcriterion.com/articles.cfm/aron-kimball-2179Raymond Aron &amp; the power of ideas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110230108/http://www.newcriterion.com/articles.cfm/aron-kimball-2179Raymond |date=2013-11-10 }}". ''New Criterion'', May 2001&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that ''Opium'' is "a seminal book of the twentieth century." Aron is also known for his lifelong friendship, sometimes fractious, with philosopher [[Jean-Paul Sartre]].&lt;ref&gt;''Memoirs: fifty years of political reflection'', By Raymond Aron (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

He is also known for his 1973 book, ''The Imperial Republic: The United States and the World 1945-1973'',  which influenced [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]] and [[Henry Kissinger]], among others.

Aron wrote extensively on a wide range of other topics. Citing the breadth and quality of Aron's writings, historian James R. Garland suggests, "Though he may be little known in America, Raymond Aron arguably stood as the preeminent example of French intellectualism for much of the twentieth century."&lt;ref name="Garland"&gt;Garland, James R. "Raymond Aron and the Intellectuals: Arguments supportive of Libertarianism." ''[[Journal of Libertarian Studies]]'', Vol. 21, No. 3 (Fall 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Born in [[Paris]], the son of a [[secular]] [[Jews|Jewish]] [[lawyer]], Aron studied at the [[École Normale Supérieure]], where he met [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], who became his friend and lifelong intellectual opponent.&lt;ref name="Garland"/&gt; He was a [[Rational humanism|rational humanist]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=R_pN217buekC&amp;pg=PA170 p.170]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aron (1994) ''In Defense of Political Reason'', p.170&lt;/ref&gt; and a leader among those who did not embrace [[existentialism]].&lt;ref name="Carruth1993p932"&gt;Carruth, Gorton (1993) ''The encyclopedia of world facts and dates'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=zHwRAQAAMAAJ p.932]&lt;/ref&gt; Aron took first place in the ''[[agrégation]]'' of philosophy in 1928, the year Sartre failed the same exam. In 1930, he received a [[doctorate]] in the [[philosophy of history]] from the [[École Normale Supérieure]].

He had been teaching [[social philosophy]] at the [[University of Toulouse]] for only a few weeks when [[World War II]] began; he joined the [[Armée de l'Air]]. When France was defeated, he left for [[London]] to join the [[Free French]] forces, editing the newspaper, ''[[France Libre]]'' (Free France).

When the war ended Aron returned to [[Paris]] to teach [[sociology]] at the [[École Nationale d'Administration]] and [[Sciences Po]]. From 1955 to 1968, he taught at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]], and after 1970 at the [[Collège de France]]. In 1953, he befriended the young American philosopher [[Allan Bloom]], who was teaching at the Sorbonne.

A lifelong [[Journalism|journalist]], Aron in 1947 became an influential [[columnist]] for ''[[Le Figaro]]'', a position he held for thirty years until he joined ''[[L'Express (France)|L'Express]]'', where he wrote a political column up to his death.

He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1960.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780-2010: Chapter A|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=25 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aron died of a heart attack in Paris on 17 October 1983.

==Political commitment==
In Berlin, Aron witnessed the rise to power of the [[Nazi Party]], and developed an aversion to all totalitarian systems. In 1938 he participated in the [[Colloque Walter Lippmann]] in Paris.

==Political thought==
Aron is the author of books on [[Karl Marx]] and on [[Carl von Clausewitz]]. In ''Peace and War'' he set out a theory of [[international relations]]. He argues that [[Max Weber]]'s claim that the State has a [[monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force]] does not apply to the relationship between States.

In the field of international relations, in the 1950s, Aron hypothesized that despite the advent of nuclear weapons, nations would still require conventional military forces. The usefulness of such forces would be made necessary by what he called a "nuclear taboo."&lt;ref&gt;http://contemporarythinkers.org/raymond-aron/introduction/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
A prolific author, he "wrote several thousand editorials and several hundred academic articles, essays, and comments, as well as about forty books",&lt;ref&gt;Henrik Østergaard Breitenbauch, "ARON, RAYMOND" in Christopher John Murray (ed.), "Encyclopedia of Modern French Thought", Routledge (2013), pp. 18-19&lt;/ref&gt; which include:

'''''Schutzjude''''' ({{IPA-de|ˈʃʊtsˌjuːdə|lang}}, "protected Jew") was a status for [[History of the Jews in Germany| German Jew]]s granted by the imperial, princely or royal courts. 

Within the [[Holy Roman Empire]], except some eastern territories gained by the Empire in the 11th and 12th centuries (e.g. [[Margraviate of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]]), Jews usually had the status of [[Servi camerae regis]]. This status included imperial protection and the levying of special taxes on the Jews for the Empire's treasury (Latin: camera regis). But the emperors, always short of money, alienated — by sale or pledge — their privilege to levy extra taxes on Jews, not all at once, but territory by territory to different creditors and purchasers. Thus Jews lost their — not always reliable — imperial protection. 

Many territories that gained supremacy over the Jews living within their boundaries subsequently expelled them. After the general expulsions of the Jews from a given territory often only single Jews&amp;nbsp;— if any at all&amp;nbsp;— would be granted the personal privilege to reside within the territory. This personal privilege, documented by a ''Schutzbrief'' (writ of protection), a ''Geleitsbrief'' (writ of escort), or (in Brandenburg) a ''Patent'', was sometimes inheritable by only one son (in rare instances, by all sons), and was sometimes uninheritable. Jews holding such a privilege were thus called ''Schutzjuden'', ''vergeleitete Juden'', or ''Patentjuden'', as opposed to Jews who had no right of residence, who were known as ''unvergeleitete Juden''. The latter were not allowed to marry, and might spend their life unmarried as a member of the household of a privileged relative or employer. 

For example, in October 1763 King [[Frederick II "the Great", King in Prussia|Frederick II]] of [[Brandenburg-Prussia]] granted [[Moses Mendelssohn]], until then under protection by being employed by a ''Patentjude'', a personal, uninheritable privilege, which assured his right to undisturbed residence in [[Berlin]]. His wife and children, who had no independent permission to reside, lost their status of family member of a ''Patentjude'' when Mendelssohn died in 1786. They were later granted multi-son inheritable ''Patents''. In 1810 [[Heinrich Friedrich Karl vom und zum Stein|Stein's]] [[Prussian reforms]] introduced a freely inheritable Prussian citizenship for all subjects of the king, doing away with the different prior legal status of the Estates, such as the Nobility, the [[bourgeoisie|burgher]]s of the chartered cities, the unfree peasants, the officialdom at the court, the Patent Jews, and the [[Huguenot]]s.

The '''Scipion Nasice Sisters Theatre''' ({{lang-sl|Gledališče sester Scipion Nasice}}) was founded on October 13, 1983, with a founding manifesto (The Sister Letter). The manifesto set this theatre group a time frame of operation – four years – and described its stages from formation to self-destruction. The Scipion Nasice Sisters Theatre (1983-1987) constituted – along with [[Laibach (band)|Laibach]] and [[IRWIN]] groups – one of the three pillars of the [[Neue Slowenische Kunst]] retrogarde movement. Within the retrogarde movement, theatre research engaged in the relation between religion, art and state. It focused on rituals and the function of spectacle in theatre and in the function of spectacle the state.

The founders of the Scipion Nasice Sisters Theatre were [[Eda Čufer]], [[Dragan Živadinov]] and [[Miran Mohar]].

The retrogarde production of events, as it was announced in the manifesto (The Sister Letter), incorporated an external manifestative part (actions) and an internal creative part (operations):
- external part: The Appearance (1983), The Resurrection (1984) and The Self-Destruction (1987)
- internal part: three stages of transformation - The Illegality (1984), The Exorcism (1985) and The Retro-Classic (1986)

In 1987, the Scipion Nasice Sisters Theatre performed self-destruction.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="787">In [[category theory]], a branch of mathematics, a '''stable model category''' is a [[pointed model category]] in which the suspension functor is an equivalence of the homotopy category with itself.

The prototypical examples are the category of [[spectrum (topology)|spectra]] in the [[stable homotopy theory]] and the category of chain complex of ''R''-modules. On the other hand, the category of pointed topological spaces and the category of pointed simplicial sets are not stable model categories.

Any stable model category is equivalent to a category of [[presheaf of spectra|presheaves of spectra]].{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

They are most frequently used in [[pulp magazine]]s, [[comic book]]s, [[science fiction]], [[television program]]s, and [[film]]s as the key attribute of a [[superhero]]. The concept originated in [[American comic book]]s and [[pulp magazines]] of the 1930s and 1940s, and has gradually worked its way into other genres and media.

== Definition ==
There is no rigid definition of a "superpower." In popular culture, it may be used to describe anything from minimal exaggeration of normal human traits to [[magic in fiction|magic]], flight, super strength, projection of destructive energy beams and force fields, invulnerability, telepathy, telekinesis, teleportation, super speed, or weather control.

Generally speaking, exceptional-but-not-superhuman fictional characters like [[Batman]], [[Iron Man]], [[Green Arrow]], and [[Punisher|the Punisher]] may be classified as superheroes even though they do not have any actual superhuman abilities. Similarly, characters with superhuman abilities derived from artificial, external sources, like the [[Six Million Dollar Man]]'s bionic limbs, [[Green Lantern]]'s [[Power ring (DC Comics)|power ring]], and Tony Stark's [[Iron Man armor]], may be described as having superpowers, but are not necessarily superhuman.

==Explanations in fiction==
In fiction, seemingly impossible superpowers are often given scientific, quasi-scientific, pseudoscientific, or supernatural explanations. Superpowers based on possible current or future technology, such as mechanized suits, rockets, [[bionics]] and [[genetic manipulation]], are typically explained using science and [[science fiction]]. Superpowers based on [[psychic]] and [[paranormal]] phenomena, for example, are typically explained using supernatural/otherworldly ideas, parapsychology, or even pseudoscience. Other superpowers may be explained using [[mythology]].

== Superpower diversification ==
[[File:CharacterProfile1.jpg|thumb|[[Role-playing games]] often described superpowers in terms of numeric values.]]
The 1970s brought the development of [[role-playing game]]s like ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ptgptb.org/0001/history1.html|title=RPG History Part One|website=ptgptb.org|access-date=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Superhero-themed games soon followed, but within the [[game mechanics]] of [[role-playing game system]]s, issues such as the name or visible effects of a form of attack became apparent. The ''[[Champions (role-playing game)|Champions]]'' role-playing game handled this by describing powers by their effects rather than their causes; for example, a laser and a lightning bolt were both considered to be forms of a ranged attack. Another issue was that some powers were simply more useful than others in terms of gameplay; ''Champions'' handled this as well by assigning each power a "value" in a point system, with more powerful or useful abilities costing more points to "buy." ''Champions'' also gave players options to modify their characters' powers, allowing each character's abilities to be unique. This system has influenced many other similar games since.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

In the 1980s, Marvel Comics began publishing their ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe]]'' series, in which the powers of their characters were explained in great detail, often using scientific and [[pseudo-scientific]] terms. Issues of persecution in relation to the possession of superpowers have also been expanded upon; an example of this is the persecution of mutants in the ''X-Men'' series.

==In manga and anime==
Superpowers are a commonly used concept in [[manga]] and [[anime]], particularly in the [[shonen]] genre. They are often featured in popular manga and anime such as [[Attack on Titan]], [[My Hero Academia]], [[HunterxHunter]], [[Naruto]], and [[Code Geass]]. The types of powers featured vary from anime to anime. Some anime, such as [[Dragon Ball Z]], feature many different characters who have the same types of powers; others, such as [[One Piece]], feature characters with a wide range of different powers, with many powers being unique to only one or a few characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.anime-planet.com/characters/tags/superpowers|title=Superpowers Characters {{!}} Anime-Planet|website=www.anime-planet.com|access-date=2016-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6692">'''Sworn testimony''' is evidence given by a witness who has made a commitment to tell the [[truth]]. If the witness is later found to have lied whilst bound by the commitment, they can often be charged with the crime of [[perjury]]. The types of commitment can include oaths, affirmations and promises which are explained in more detail below. The exact wording of the commitments vary from country to country.

==Types of commitment==

The commitment can come in different forms depending on the situation of the witness. The types of commitment used in the [[United Kingdom]] are:

*'''Oath''': A commitment made to the witness's [[deity]], or on their holy book.
*'''Affirmation''': A [[Secularism|secular]] variant of the oath where the witness does not have to mention a deity or holy book.
*'''Promise''': A commitment made by a witness under the age of 17, or of all witnesses if none of the accused are over the age of 17.

==Variations by country==

[[File:Dinner at Haddo House, 1884 by Alfred Edward Emslie.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|The dinner party]][[Table manners]] are the cultural customs and rules of [[etiquette]] used while dining. As in other areas of [[Etiquette in North America|North American etiquette]], the rules governing appropriate table manners have changed over time and may differ depending on the setting (e.g. dining at home, at a restaurant, or with business colleagues).

== History ==
{{Undue weight|date=May 2018|to=information outside the scope of the article's title}}
Table manners have an ancient and complex history, as each society has gradually evolved its system.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Rituals of Dinner|last=Visser|first=Margaret|publisher=Penguin Group|year=1992|isbn=0-8021-1116-5|location=New York|pages=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Today, many of the behaviors that take place at the dinner table are deeply rooted in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.richmond.com/life/celebrations/the-history-of-table-settings-and-dining-etiquette/article_ac248388-e07c-5dbf-94c8-31cf71084d76.html|title=The history of table settings and dining etiquette|last=Creative|first=Metro|work=Richmond Times-Dispatch|access-date=2018-04-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, Italy more or less led the cultural revolution starting with the renaissance. Italian poet Giovanni Della Casa advised in ''Galateo'', his 1558 book on manners: "One should not comb his hair nor wash his hands in public... the exception to this is the washing of the hands when done before sitting down to dinner, for then it should be done in full sight of others, even if you do not need to wash them at all, so that whoever dips into the same bowl as you will be certain of your cleanliness."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/renaissance-table-etiquette-and-the-origins-of-manners-31348606/|title=Renaissance Table Etiquette and the Origins of Manners|last=Rhodes|first=Jesse|work=Smithsonian|access-date=2018-04-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some other examples are:
#Eat rolls or bread by tearing off small bite-size pieces and buttering only the piece you are preparing to eat. When ready for another piece, repeat the same process. (Desiderius Erasmus, 1532)&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ezproxy.everettcc.edu/login?url=https://ezproxy.everettcc.edu:2060/docview/1848376163?accountid=1167|title=A Place at the Table for Good Manners|last=Garner|first=Dwight|date=|website=ezproxy.everettcc.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Engage in table conversation that is pleasant but entirely free of controversial subjects. (Thomas Twyne, 1576)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
#If you need something that you cannot reach easily, politely ask the person closest to the item you need to pass it to you. (Thomas Tusser, 1577)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
#Elbows on the table are acceptable only between courses, not while you are eating. Never chew with your mouth open or make loud noises when you eat. Although it is possible to talk with a small piece of food in your mouth, do not talk with your mouth full. If food gets caught between your teeth and you can't remove it with your tongue, leave the table and go to a mirror where you can remove the food from your teeth in private. (William Phiston, 1609)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Proper manners were a concern even of leaders in the society of eighteenth-century America –– Benjamin Franklin's  Poor Richard's Almanac, for instance, included comments on proper behavior. During the nineteenth century, hundreds of books on etiquette were published in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://lifelessons4u.wordpress.com/tag/history-of-manners-and-etiquette/|title=History of Manners and Etiquette {{!}} Life Lessons|website=lifelessons4u.wordpress.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the home ==
Each household may have a unique set of rules at the table, but despite cultural differences, there are some essential table manners most families share, including rules against picking one's teeth at the table and chewing with one's mouth open.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://emilypost.com/advice/top-ten-table-manners/|title=Top Ten Table Manners - The Emily Post Institute, Inc.|work=The Emily Post Institute, Inc.|access-date=2018-04-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to changing lifestyles, table manners are more casual than they were in the 1950s. For example, some commentators contend that the common prohibition against placing elbows on the table no longer applies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mannersmentor.com/social-situations/elbows-on-the-table-have-the-manners-changed-yep|title=Elbows On the Table, Have the Manners Changed? Yes!|last=|first=|date=2014-04-24|work=Manners Mentor|access-date=2018-04-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, many families eat fast food without silverware and eat meals in front of the television or in the car rather than following past norms of gathering the family at the dining table for a meal. Critics claim that these changes have led to fewer opportunities to learn table manners in the home.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/16/garden/table-manners-a-casualty-of-changing-times.html|title=TABLE MANNERS: A CASUALTY OF CHANGING TIMES|last=Greer|first=William R.|access-date=2018-04-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/capitalbusiness/career-coach-table-etiquette-still-matters/2014/04/25/adf17dbe-cbbe-11e3-93eb-6c0037dde2ad_story.html|title=Career Coach: Table etiquette still matters|last=Russell|first=Joyce E. A.|date=2014-04-27|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-04-29|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, advancement of technology in recent years raises issues regarding [[smartphone]] use at the dining table. Opinions vary regarding whether the use of smartphones at the dining table is acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/4010146/smartphones-dinner/|title=Everybody Hates When You Use Your Phone at Dinner|website=Time|language=en|access-date=2018-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ns.umich.edu/new/releases/23864-phones-at-the-dinner-table-u-m-study-explores-attitudes|title=Phones at the dinner table: U-M study explores attitudes {{!}} University of Michigan News|website=ns.umich.edu|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Offenses ==
The convention of avoiding putting one's elbows on the table while eating arose from a time when tables were sufficiently rustic and unstable that leaning on them could cause loose planks to disrupt the meal.[https://culinarylore.com/food-history:no-elbows-on-the-table/ ht]  However, as time has changed, it has become more acceptable to put one's elbows on the table, but only between courses, not while eating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://emilypost.com/advice/top-ten-table-manners/|title=Top Ten Table Manners - The Emily Post Institute, Inc.|work=The Emily Post Institute, Inc.|access-date=2018-11-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bibim naengmyeon by roland in Vancouver.jpg|thumb|Slurping is an action that has been perceived differently by different cultures.|alt=]]
The main reason to be quiet while eating is for safety. According to the [[National Safety Council]], suffocation, especially on foods, was ranked fourth on a list of major causes of death in American homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nsc.org/home-safety|title=Safety at Home|website=www.nsc.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a case in an American middle school that involved one of the students choking while eating in the cafeteria.

&lt;nowiki&gt; &lt;/nowiki&gt;In most places, it is unacceptable for someone to make disapproving or disrespectful sounds when presented with food. Likewise, blowing one's nose at the table is unacceptable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/12557773|title=Food &amp; nutrition : customs &amp; culture|last=Paul.|first=Fieldhouse,|date=1986|publisher=Croom Helm|year=|isbn=0709910428|location=London|pages=68–69|oclc=12557773}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, slurping food is considered offensive and impolite and inconsiderate to others. For example it is illegal to slurp soup at a public eating place in [[New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/15/nyregion/jersey-welcome-to-the-capital-of-wacky-laws.html|title=JERSEY; Welcome to the Capital of Wacky Laws|last=Genzlinger|first=Neil|date=2001-07-15|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-05-02|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not every good table manner in North America is acceptable in every part of the world. Certain manners are considered rude in other cultures; for example, leaving tips. It is normal for an American to leave a tip for their waiter. However, it is offensive to tip waiters in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businessinsider.com.au/japanese-customs-that-are-shocking-to-foreign-travelers-2015-2|title=11 Japanese customs that are shocking to foreign travellers|last=Thrastardottir|first=Asta|date=2015-02-19|work=Business Insider Australia|access-date=2018-05-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Business related ==
As business dealings can take place over a meal, table manners may be put to good use while dining with clientele, co-workers, or subordinates - building rapport with a client, celebrating the accomplishments of a team, or simply hosting a discussion in a non-office setting all call for proper etiquette if dining is involved. It is deemed an essential enough behavioral skill that has suffered from a decline in naturally occurring generational inheritance&lt;ref&gt;Greer, William R. "TABLE MANNERS: A CASUALTY OF CHANGING TIMES." ''New York Times,'' Late Edition (East Coast) ed., Oct 16 1985, ''ProQuest.'' Web. 30 Apr. 2018&lt;/ref&gt; to the effect that some schools have opened programs and classes centered around dining etiquette to educate students in the practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title="Bad Dining Etiquette can often Hamper Your Career."|last=|first=|date=April 8, 2018|work=Detroit Free Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poor table manners can affect the opinion of those involved, as well as the outcome of the meeting.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Business Etiquette: Make a Good Impression - Gain the Competitive Edge|last=Dunckel|first=Jacqueline|publisher=International Self-Counsel Press Ltd.|year=August 1992|isbn=0-88908-531-5|location=Canada|pages=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many appropriate mannerisms from formal dining situations can be applied in a business setting, though variations exist depending on who is the host and who is the guest, and the relation the one has with the other. Speaking while still chewing or mid-bite may be acceptable in an informal lunch setting with often-seen coworkers, but in a high-stakes meeting with a potential customer, it will likely come off as rude. [[Napkin]]s are intended to be kept in the lap. The exception is when leaving the table temporarily - placed on the chair signals the staff that the diner's meal is unfinished, placed on the table near the plate shows the patron has completed their meal.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Unless the host offers to pay the inevitable bill, it should be assumed that each diner is responsible for their own bill, and the staff (and table) should be made aware of this at the appropriate time.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Meier, Myka. "How to Deal with an Over-Spender Who always Wants to Split the Bill." ''The New York Observer,'' Nov 07 2017, ''ProQuest.'' Web. 30 Apr. 2018&lt;/ref&gt; The former being the case typically does not mean that the most expensive item on the menu should be sought out.

The [[dress code]] for a business related dining event can vary, usually around when the event takes place. The lunch period will likely find participants wearing what they wore to work, though special events may require a higher level of dress.

The level of formality can vary depending on the formality of the restaurant.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Proper table manners ought to begin as soon as one arrives at a table. The very first step after sitting down is place the napkin in one's lap.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ala-apa.org/newsletter/2008/11/14/dining-etiquette-a-refresher-course/|title=Dining Etiquette: A Refresher Course – Library Worklife:|last=Bremer|first=Jill|date=2008|website=ala-apa.org|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With the napkin placed on the lap, it protects clothing from spills or food that may fall into the diner's lap.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rootedinfoods.com/table-manners-the-napkin/|title=Table Manners: The Napkin {{!}} Rooted in Foods|last=|first=|date=2017-08-25|website=rootedinfoods.com|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:PlaceSettingCharger.jpg|thumb|The basic place setting]]
It is important to be able to navigate the table setting, not only knowing which utensils to use, but which items are meant for whose use. A general rule of thumb for selecting the proper spoon or fork when provided with multiple is to start on the outside and work your way in.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.etiquettescholar.com/dining_etiquette/table_setting.html#table_setting_guide|title=The Ultimate Table Setting Guide|last=|first=|date=|website=www.etiquettescholar.com|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, if you are starting with a salad course and you have two forks to choose from, the fork farthest from the plate should be used, leaving the closer one for the main course.  Similarly, if you start with soup, select the spoon that is farthest from the plate.

Many restaurants set the table with a bread plate and water glass at each seat before patrons arrive. The bread plate goes to the left of the plate, and the beverage to the right.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rodalewellness.com/living-well/dining-table-manners-etiquette/slide/4|title=10 Basic Table Manners Rules You Should Always Follow|last=Williams Brown|first=Kelly|date=2017-03-08|work=Rodale Wellness|access-date=2018-04-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To avoid drinking from the wrong glass or taking a bite of your neighbor's bread, use the following trick if you forget which is yours:&lt;blockquote&gt;Touch both your index fingers to your thumbs. On your left, you will see a lowercase ''b'', which stands for the bread plate. On your right is a lowercase ''d'' for Drinks.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Dining in North America is widely viewed as a social occasion, rather than simply an opportunity to eat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://emilypost.com/advice/texting-at-the-dinner-table/|title=Texting at the Dinner Table - The Emily Post Institute, Inc.|last=Post Senning|first=Cindy|date=|work=The Emily Post Institute, Inc.|access-date=2018-04-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As such, it is important to show the people dining with you that you respect them and their time enough to put your cell phone away.  According to a study done by the Pew Research Center, 38% percent of people think it is acceptable to use cell phones in restaurants, and that number gets even smaller depending on the occasion.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/08/26/key-findings-about-etiquette-in-the-digital-age/|title=Manners 2.0: Key findings about etiquette in the digital age|last=Rainie|first=Lee|date=2015-08-26|work=Pew Research Center|access-date=2018-04-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  12% of people think it is OK to use cell phones at family dinners, and only 5% think it is appropriate during meetings.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

When it comes to paying the bill in American restaurants, adding a tip is a common custom that is often expected by the waiter.  According to a study by [http://CreditCards.com CreditCards.com], 4 out of 5 Americans always leave a tip when dining out, and the average tip is 16%-20% of the total bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://demographicpartitions.org/demographics-tipping-restaurants/|title=Demographics of Tipping at Restaurants - Demographic Partitions|last=|first=|date=2017-07-26|work=Demographic Partitions|access-date=2018-05-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The unger march.jpg|thumb|''The Hunger March'' in [[China]], 2005]]

'''''The Hunger March''''' is the name of a [[happening]] and a series of [[sculpture]]s made by [[Jens Galschiøt]] in 2001.

== Concept ==

The event was inspired by the 1990 movie ''[[The March (1990 film)|The March]]'', in which a horde of starving people marches towards Europe.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

''The Hunger March'' is a reminder that, if the world's need and distress is not relieved, the desperate victims will some day be knocking on the doors of the affluent.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aidoh.dk/new-struct/Happenings-and-Projects/Happenings/Hungermarch/Hungermarch.com/default.html Official website&lt;/ref&gt; To remind people of the issues the world is facing, Galschiøt created 27 sculptures of starving African kids out of bronze.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kunstdk.dk/kunstner/jens_galschiot/tekster/cv |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302035857/http://www.kunstdk.dk/kunstner/jens_galschiot/tekster/cv |archivedate=2014-03-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The "kids" have a sad look on their faces. The bronze is darkened to give them a sad, dark look. At the bottom of the sculpture, there is a shining new shoe, made by one of the major shoe companies that is responsible for the use of poor kids in the third world to work for a small payment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.labourbehindthelabel.org/campaigns/item/990-in-pictures-made-in-cambodia |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119162541/http://www.labourbehindthelabel.org/campaigns/item/990-in-pictures-made-in-cambodia |archivedate=2012-01-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==The first happening==

In May 2001, in the center of [[Odense]], a bronze sculpture of a 12-year-old starved black boy, with a large pair of shining new [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] shoes, was set up so that it appeared to watch the well-fed Danes rushing by. The sculpture stood on a polished black granite pedestal, with the slogan "[[Just Do It|JUST DO IT]]" written on it.

Galschiøt stated "With this sculpture, I'll pinpoint the hypocrisy of companies who in their lifestyle commercials are linking their brands with concepts such as freedom and equality and at the same time are cynically exploiting and 
oppressing the workers who make the products."{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

==''The Hunger March'' at the ASEM 4==

During the [[Asia–Europe Meeting|ASEM]] 4 summit in [[Copenhagen]] in September 2002,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aseminfoboard.org/Summits/ASEM4&lt;/ref&gt; 27 "starving boys" were placed in Copenhagen to demonstrate for social justice. The 27 sculptures were supposed to represent the starving people in the [[Third World]] countries that are influenced by the way that the summit  focuses on corporations' profit, instead of poor peoples' interests. The event was arranged in co-operation with Care-Denmark and [[The Salvation Army]]. The latter organization supplied the boys with [[Adidas]], Nike and [[Reebok]] shoes.&lt;ref&gt;http://sculptures.aidoh.dk/index.html?lang=uk&amp;&amp;view=list&amp;order=2&amp;rpp=15&amp;start=0&amp;ID=251&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other happenings with ''The Hunger March''==

In the summer of 2002, a crowd of 27 starving African boys cast in copper started a tour throughout [[Denmark]] to protest against the government's cutback of development aid. 

Galschiøt launched the action in cooperation with the NGO Forum in [[Aarhus]]. Hundreds of volunteers took part in the creation of the sculptures in the artist's workshop, and subsequently in the mobilization of the boys all over the country. 

In March 2003, [[DanChurchAid]] is using the sculptures in their collection to support children who have been left orphans due to [[AIDS]].

==''The Hunger March'' today==
''The Hunger March'' has often appeared as a participant in different demonstrations in Denmark, such as the climate demonstrations. Usually the sculptures are placed on small wagons, where they appear as being a part of the marching crowd.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="53588">The '''Theatre of the Absurd''' ({{lang-fr|théâtre de l'absurde}} {{IPA-fr|teɑtʁ(ə) də lapsyʁd|}}) is a post–World War II designation for particular [[Play (theatre)|plays]] of [[absurdist fiction]] written by a number of primarily European [[playwright]]s in the late 1950s, as well as one for the style of theatre which has evolved from their work. Their work focused largely on the idea of [[existentialism]] and expressed what happens when human existence has no meaning or purpose and therefore all communication breaks down.  Logical construction and argument gives way to irrational and illogical speech and to its ultimate conclusion, silence.&lt;ref&gt;''The Hutchinson Encyclopedia'', Millennium Edition, Helicon 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Critic [[Martin Esslin]] coined the term in his 1960 essay "Theatre of the Absurd".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Theatre of the Absurd |first=Martin |last=Esslin |year=1961 |oclc=329986 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He related these plays based on a broad theme of the Absurd, similar to the way [[Albert Camus]] uses the term in his 1942 essay ''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arts.gla.ac.uk/Slavonic/Absurd.htm |title=THE THEATRE OF THE ABSURD: THE WEST AND THE EAST |first=Jan |last=Culík |date=2000 |publisher=University of Glasgow |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090823075755/http://www.arts.gla.ac.uk/Slavonic/Absurd.htm |archivedate=2009-08-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Absurd in these plays takes the form of man's reaction to a world apparently without meaning, or man as a puppet controlled or menaced by invisible outside forces. This style of writing was first popularized by the Samuel Beckett play ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'' (1953). Although the term is applied to a wide range of plays, some characteristics coincide in many of the plays: broad comedy, often similar to [[vaudeville]], mixed with horrific or tragic images; characters caught in hopeless situations forced to do repetitive or meaningless actions; dialogue full of clichés, wordplay, and nonsense; plots that are cyclical or absurdly expansive; either a parody or dismissal of [[Theatrical realism|realism]] and the concept of the "[[well-made play]]". These plays were shaped by the political turmoil, scientific breakthrough, and social upheaval going on in the world around the playwrights during these times.{{fact|date=September 2018}}

While absurdists believed that life is absurd, they also believed that death and the "after life" were equally absurd if not more, and that whether people live or not all of their actions are pointless and everything will lead to the same end (hence the repetitiveness in many of these absurdist plays).{{fact|date=September 2018}}

In his book ''Absurd Drama'' (1965), Esslin wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;... the Theatre of the Absurd attacks the comfortable certainties of religious or political orthodoxy. It aims to shock its audience out of complacency, to bring it face to face with the harsh facts of the human situation as these writers see it. But the challenge behind this message is anything but one of despair. It is a challenge to accept the human condition as it is, in all its mystery and absurdity, and to bear it with dignity, nobly, responsibly; precisely {{em|because}} there are no easy solutions to the mysteries of existence, because ultimately man is alone in a meaningless world. The shedding of easy solutions, of comforting illusions, may be painful, but it leaves behind it a sense of freedom and relief. And that is why, in the last resort, the Theatre of the Absurd does not provoke tears of despair but the laughter of liberation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Playwrights commonly associated with the Theatre of the Absurd include [[Samuel Beckett]], [[Eugène Ionesco]], [[Jean Genet]], [[Arthur Adamov]], [[Harold Pinter]], [[Luigi Pirandello]], [[Tom Stoppard]], [[Friedrich Dürrenmatt]], [[Miguel Mihura]], [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]], [[Fernando Arrabal]], [[Václav Havel]], [[Edward Albee]], [[Malay Roy Choudhury]], [[Tadeusz Różewicz]], [[Sławomir Mrożek]], [[N.F. Simpson]], and [[Badal Sarkar]].{{fact|date=September 2018}}

== Origin ==
In the first edition of ''The Theatre of the Absurd'', Esslin saw the work of these playwrights as giving artistic meaning to [[Albert Camus]]'s philosophy that life is inherently without meaning, as illustrated in his work ''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]''. In the first (1961) edition, Esslin presented the four defining playwrights of the movement as [[Samuel Beckett]], [[Arthur Adamov]], [[Eugène Ionesco]], and [[Jean Genet]], and in subsequent editions he added a fifth playwright, [[Harold Pinter]]—although each of these writers has unique preoccupations and characteristics that go beyond the term "absurd."&lt;ref name=Esslin1961ed&gt;Martin Esslin, ''The Theatre of the Absurd'' (Garden City, NY: Doubleday, 1961). (Subsequent references to this ed. appear within parentheses in the text.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Esslin2004ed&gt;Martin Esslin, ''The Theatre of the Absurd'', 3rd ed. (New York: Vintage [Knopf], 2004). (Subsequent references to this ed. appear within parentheses in the text.)&lt;/ref&gt; Other writers associated with this group by Esslin and other critics include [[Tom Stoppard]],&lt;ref&gt;Terry Hodgson. ''The plays of Tom Stoppard: for stage, radio, TV and film''.Palgrave Macmillan, 2001. {{ISBN|1-84046-241-8}}, {{ISBN|978-1-84046-241-8}}.pg.181.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Friedrich Dürrenmatt]],&lt;ref&gt;Joel Agee.

== Significant precursors ==
Though the label "Theatre of the Absurd" covers a wide variety of playwrights with differing styles, they do have some common stylistic precursors (Esslin [1961]). These precursors include Elizabethan tragicomedy, formal experimentation, pataphysics, surrealism, Dadaism, and most importantly existentialism.

=== Elizabethan – tragicomedy ===
The mode of most "absurdist" plays is [[tragicomedy]].&lt;ref name="Esslin, pg. 323-324"&gt;Esslin, pg. 323–324&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. L. Styan. ''Modern Drama in Theory and Practice''. Cambridge University Press, 1983 {{ISBN|0-521-29629-3}}, pg. 125&lt;/ref&gt; As Nell says in ''[[Endgame (play)|Endgame]]'', "Nothing is funnier than unhappiness … it's the most comical thing in the world".&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Beckett. ''Endgame: a play in one act, followed by Act without words, a mime for one player''. Grove Press, 1958. {{ISBN|0-8021-5024-1}}. pg. 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt;  Esslin cites [[William Shakespeare]] as an influence on this aspect of the "Absurd drama."&lt;ref&gt;Esslin, pg. 321–323&lt;/ref&gt; Shakespeare's influence is acknowledged directly in the titles of Ionesco's ''[[Macbett]]'' and Stoppard's ''[[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead]]''. Friedrich Dürrenmatt says in his essay "Problems of the Theatre", "Comedy alone is suitable for us … But the tragic is still possible even if pure tragedy is not.  We can achieve the tragic out of comedy.  We can bring it forth as a frightening moment, as an abyss that opens suddenly; indeed, many of Shakespeare's tragedies are already really comedies out of which the tragic arises."&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Dürrenmatt. "Problems of the Theatre". ''The Marriage of Mr. Mississippi''. Grove Press, 1964. {{ISBN|978-0-394-17198-2}}. pg. 30–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though layered with a significant amount of tragedy, the Theatre of the Absurd echoes other great forms of comedic performance, according to Esslin, from [[Commedia dell'arte]] to [[vaudeville]].&lt;ref name="Esslin, pg. 323-324" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Styan, pg. 126&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Esslin cites early film comedians and [[music hall]] artists such as [[Charlie Chaplin]], the [[Keystone Cops]] and [[Buster Keaton]] as direct influences. (Keaton even starred in Beckett's ''[[Film (film)|Film]]'' in 1965.)&lt;ref&gt;Esslin, pg. 325&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Formal experimentation ===
As an experimental form of theatre, many Theatre of the Absurd playwrights employ techniques borrowed from earlier innovators. Writers and techniques frequently mentioned in relation to the Theatre of the Absurd include the 19th-century nonsense poets, such as [[Lewis Carroll]] or [[Edward Lear]];&lt;ref&gt;Esslin, pg. 330–331&lt;/ref&gt; Polish playwright [[Stanisław Ignacy Witkiewicz]];&lt;ref&gt;Esslin, pg. 382–385&lt;/ref&gt; the Russians [[Daniil Kharms]],&lt;ref&gt;Neil Cornwell. ''The absurd in literature.'' Manchester University Press ND, 2006. {{ISBN|0-7190-7410-X}}. pg. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nikolai Erdman]],&lt;ref&gt;John Freedman. ''The major plays of Nikolai Erdman: The warrant and The suicide''. Routledge, 1995.{{ISBN|3718655837}}. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt; and others; [[Bertolt Brecht]]'s [[Distancing effect|distancing]] techniques in his "[[Epic theatre]]";&lt;ref&gt;Esslin, pg. 365–368&lt;/ref&gt; and the "dream plays" of [[August Strindberg]].&lt;ref name="Esslin1961ed" /&gt;&lt;ref name = StyanDark&gt;J. L. Styan. ''The dark comedy: the development of modern comic tragedy.'' Cambridge University Press, 1968. {{ISBN|0-521-09529-8}}. pg. 217.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--needs page numbers in citations throughout--&gt;

One commonly cited precursor is [[Luigi Pirandello]], especially ''[[Six Characters in Search of an Author]]''.&lt;ref name = StyanDark /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Annette J. Saddik. Ed. "Experimental Innovations After the Second World War". ''Contemporary American Drama''.Edinburgh University Press, 2007. {{ISBN|0-7486-2494-5}}.pg. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Pirandello was a highly regarded theatrical experimentalist who wanted to bring down the [[fourth wall]] presupposed by the [[Realism (theatre)|realism]] of playwrights such as [[Henrik Ibsen]].&lt;!--Page number references to citations needed throughout.--&gt; According to [[W. B. Worthen]], ''Six Characters'' and other Pirandello plays use "[[Metatheatre]]—[[roleplaying]], [[Play within a play|plays-within-plays]], and a flexible sense of the limits of stage and illusion—to examine a highly-theatricalized vision of [[Personal identity|identity]]".&lt;ref&gt;Worthen, pg. 702&lt;/ref&gt;

Another influential playwright was [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] whose ''[[The Breasts of Tiresias]]'' was the first work to be called "[[Surrealism|surreal]]".&lt;ref name = Lewis260&gt;Allan Lewis. "The Theatre of the 'Absurd' – Beckett, Ionesco, Genet". ''The Contemporary Theatre: The Significant Playwrights of Our Time''. Crown Publishers, 1966. pg. 260&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Glasgow&gt;Rupert D. V. Glasgow. ''Madness, Masks, and Laughter: An Essay on Comedy''. Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press, 1995. {{ISBN|0-8386-3559-8}}. pg. 332.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deborah B. Gaensbauer. ''The French theater of the absurd''. Twayne Publishers, 1991. {{ISBN|0-8057-8270-2}}. pg. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pataphysics, surrealism, and Dadaism ===
One of the most significant common precursors is [[Alfred Jarry]] whose wild, irreverent, and lascivious ''Ubu'' plays scandalized Paris in the 1890s. Likewise, the concept of [['pataphysics]]—"the science of imaginary solutions"—first presented in Jarry's ''Gestes et opinions du docteur Faustroll, pataphysicien'' (''[[Exploits and Opinions of Dr. Faustroll, pataphysician]]'')&lt;ref&gt;Jill Fell. ''Alfred Jarry, an imagination in revolt''. Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press, 2005. {{ISBN|0-8386-4007-9}}. pg. 53&lt;/ref&gt; was inspirational to many later Absurdists,&lt;ref name="Glasgow" /&gt; some of whom joined the Collège de 'pataphysique, founded in honor of Jarry in 1948&lt;ref name="Lewis260" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Esslin, pag. 346–348&lt;/ref&gt; (Ionesco,&lt;ref name = Queneau&gt;Raymond Queneau, Marc Lowenthal. ''Stories &amp; remarks''.U of Nebraska Press, 2000
{{ISBN|0-8032-8852-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-8852-2}}. pg. ix–x&lt;/ref&gt; Arrabal, and Vian&lt;ref name="Queneau" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Bellos. ''Georges Perec: a life in words : a biography''. David R. Godine Publisher, 1993. {{ISBN|0-87923-980-8}}, {{ISBN|978-0-87923-980-0}}. pg.596&lt;/ref&gt; were given the title Transcendent Satrape of the Collège de 'pataphysique). The Alfred Jarry Theatre, founded by [[Antonin Artaud]] and [[Roger Vitrac]], housed several Absurdist plays, including ones by Ionesco and Adamov.&lt;ref&gt;Esslin, pg. 373.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cornwell, pg.170&lt;/ref&gt;

Artaud's "[[Theatre of Cruelty|The Theatre of Cruelty]]" (presented in ''[[Theatre and its Double|The Theatre and Its Double]]'') was a particularly important philosophical treatise. Artaud claimed theatre's reliance on literature was inadequate and that the true power of theatre was in its visceral impact.&lt;ref&gt;Antonin Artaud ''The Theatre and Its Double''.  Tr. Mary Caroline Richards.  New York: Grove Weidenfeld, 1958., pg. 15–133.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Styan, ''Modern'' pg. 128&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Saddik, pg. 24–27.&lt;/ref&gt; Artaud was a [[Surrealism|Surrealist]], and many other members of the Surrealist group were significant influences on the Absurdists.&lt;ref&gt;Esslin, pg. 372–375.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mel Gussow. ''Theatre on the edge: new visions, new voices''. Hal Leonard Corporation, 1998. {{ISBN|1-55783-311-7}}. pg. 303.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eli Rozik. ''The roots of theatre: rethinking ritual and other theories of origin''. University of Iowa Press, 2002. {{ISBN|0-87745-817-0}}. pg. 264.&lt;/ref&gt;

Absurdism is also frequently compared to Surrealism's predecessor, [[Dadaism]] (for example, the Dadaist plays by [[Tristan Tzara]] performed at the [[Cabaret Voltaire (Zürich)|Cabaret Voltaire]] in Zürich).&lt;ref&gt;Richard Drain.

=== Relationship with existentialism ===

Many of the Absurdists were contemporaries with [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], the philosophical spokesman for existentialism in Paris, but few Absurdists actually committed to Sartre's own existentialist philosophy, as expressed in ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'', and many of the Absurdists had a complicated relationship with him.  Sartre praised Genet's plays, stating that for Genet, "Good is only an illusion. Evil is a Nothingness which arises upon the ruins of Good".&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Paul Sartre. "Introduction to ''The Maids; and Deathwatch''" ''The Maids; and Deathwatch''. Grove Press, 1962. {{ISBN|0-8021-5056-X}}. pg. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ionesco, however, hated Sartre bitterly.&lt;ref&gt;Eugène Ionesco. ''Present Past, Past Present''. Da Capo Press, 1998. {{ISBN|0-306-80835-8}}. pg. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; Ionesco accused Sartre of supporting Communism but ignoring the atrocities committed by Communists; he wrote ''[[Rhinoceros (play)|Rhinoceros]]'' as a criticism of blind conformity, whether it be to Nazism or Communism; at the end of the play, one man remains on Earth resisting transformation into a rhinoceros&lt;ref&gt;Eugène Ionesco. ''Fragments of a Journal''. Tr. Jean Stewart. London: Faber and Faber, 1968. pg. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rosette C. Lamont. ''Ionesco's imperatives: the politics of culture''. University of Michigan Press, 1993. {{ISBN|0-472-10310-5}}. pg. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;  Sartre criticized ''Rhinoceros'' by questioning: "Why is there one man who resists? At least we could learn why, but no, we learn not even that. He resists because he is there".&lt;ref&gt;"Beyond Bourgeois Theatre" 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, pg. 275.&lt;/ref&gt;  Sartre's criticism highlights a primary difference between the Theatre of the Absurd and existentialism: the Theatre of the Absurd shows the failure of man without recommending a solution.&lt;ref&gt;Lamont, pg. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1966 interview, [[Claude Bonnefoy]], comparing the Absurdists to Sartre and Camus, said to Ionesco, "It seems to me that Beckett, Adamov and yourself started out less from philosophical reflections or a return to classical sources, than from first-hand experience and a desire to find a new theatrical expression that would enable you to render this experience in all its acuteness and also its immediacy. If Sartre and Camus thought out these themes, you expressed them in a far more vital contemporary fashion". Ionesco replied, "I have the feeling that these writers – who are serious and important – were talking about absurdity and death, but that they never really lived these themes, that they did not feel them within themselves in an almost irrational, visceral way, that all this was not deeply inscribed in their language. With them it was still rhetoric, eloquence. With Adamov and Beckett it really is a very naked reality that is conveyed through the apparent dislocation of language".&lt;ref&gt;Claude Bonnefoy. ''Conversations with Eugène Ionesco''. Trans. Jan Dawson. Holt, Rinehard and Winston, 1971. pg. 122–123.&lt;/ref&gt;

In comparison to Sartre's concepts of the function of literature, [[Samuel Beckett]]'s primary focus was on the ''failure'' of man to overcome "absurdity" - or the repetition of life even though the end result will be the same no matter what and everything is essentially pointless - as James Knowlson says in ''Damned to Fame'', Beckett's work focuses, "on poverty, failure, exile and loss — as he put it, on man as a 'non-knower' and as a 'non-can-er'&amp;nbsp;."&lt;ref&gt;Knowlson, pg. 319&lt;/ref&gt;  Beckett's own relationship with Sartre was complicated by a mistake made in the publication of one of his stories in Sartre's journal ''[[Les Temps Modernes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Knowlson, pg. 325.&lt;/ref&gt; Beckett said, though he liked ''[[Nausea (novel)|Nausea]]'', he generally found the writing style of Sartre and [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]] to be "too philosophical" and he considered himself "not a philosopher".&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Cronin, Isaac Cronin. ''Samuel Beckett: the last modernist''. Da Capo Press, 1999. {{ISBN|0-306-80898-6}}. pg. 231.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The "Absurd" or "New Theater" movement was originally a Paris-based (and a [[Rive Gauche]]) avant-garde phenomenon tied to extremely small theaters in the [[Quartier Latin]].  Some of the Absurdists, such as [[Jean Genet]],&lt;ref&gt;Peter Norrish. ''New tragedy and comedy in France, 1945–1970''.Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1988. {{ISBN|0-389-20746-2}}. pg. 107&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean Tardieu]],&lt;ref name = Hardison438&gt;Felicia Hardison Londré, Margot Berthold.

In England some of those whom Esslin considered practitioners of the Theatre of the Absurd include [[Harold Pinter]],&lt;ref name="Hardison438" /&gt; [[Tom Stoppard]],&lt;ref&gt;Gabrielle H.

=== Legacy ===
Echoes of elements of "The Theatre of the Absurd" can be seen in the work of many later playwrights, from more [[avant-garde]] or experimental playwrights like [[Suzan-Lori Parks]]—in ''[[The Death of the Last Black Man in the Whole Entire World]]'' and ''[[The America Play]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Enoch Brater. "After the Absurd". ''Around the Absurd: Essays on Modern and Postmodern Drama''. Ed. Enoch Brater and Ruby Cohn. University of Michigan Press, 1990. {{ISBN|978-0-472-10205-1}}. pg. 293–301.&lt;/ref&gt; for example—to relatively realistic playwrights like [[David Mamet]]—in ''[[Glengarry Glen Ross]]'', which Mamet dedicated to [[Harold Pinter]].&lt;ref&gt;David Mamet.

In addition, the absurd drama has also found its way in [[Urdu literature]], ''Mazaron Ke Phool'' [i.e. Graveyard Flowers] (2008) by contemporary Pakistani writer, poet and columnist Mujtaba Haider Zaidi is the first absurd drama in the history of Urdu literature. Created in the pattern of ancient Greek tragedies, the drama contains only two characters, and carries both poetry and prose in it, and hence fulfills all the requirements necessary for a perfect Absurd drama.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}

== Theatrical features ==
Plays within this group are absurd in that they focus not on logical acts, realistic occurrences, or traditional character development; they, instead, focus on human beings trapped in an incomprehensible world subject to any occurrence, no matter how illogical.&lt;ref&gt;Styan, ''Dark'' 218&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Saddik, pg. 29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Norrish, pg. 2–8.&lt;/ref&gt;  The theme of incomprehensibility is coupled with the inadequacy of language to form meaningful human connections.&lt;ref name="Lewis260" /&gt; According to Martin Esslin, Absurdism is "the inevitable devaluation of ideals, purity, and purpose"&lt;ref&gt;Esslin, pg. 24&lt;/ref&gt;  Absurdist drama asks its viewer to "draw his own conclusions, make his own errors".&lt;ref&gt;Esslin, pg. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Though Theatre of the Absurd may be seen as nonsense, they have something to say and can be understood".&lt;ref&gt;Esslin, pg. 21&lt;/ref&gt; Esslin makes a distinction between the dictionary definition of absurd ("out of harmony" in the musical sense) and drama's understanding of the Absurd: "Absurd is that which is devoid of purpose... Cut off from his religious, metaphysical, and transcendental roots, man is lost; all his actions become senseless, absurd, useless".&lt;ref&gt;Ionesco in Esslin, pg. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Characters ===
The characters in Absurdist drama are lost and floating in an incomprehensible universe and they abandon rational devices and discursive thought because these approaches are inadequate.&lt;ref&gt;Watt and Richardson 1154&lt;/ref&gt; Many characters appear as automatons stuck in routines speaking only in cliché (Ionesco called the Old Man and Old Woman in ''[[Les Chaises|The Chairs]]'' "uber-marrionettes").&lt;ref&gt;Lamont, pg. 72&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scope.nottingham.ac.uk/article.php?id=85&amp;issue=3|title=Open access journal for Film and Television Studies|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Characters are frequently stereotypical, [[archetype|archetypal]], or flat character types as in [[Commedia dell'arte]].&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Cronin, Isaac Cronin. ''Samuel Beckett: the last modernist''. Da Capo Press, 1999. {{ISBN|0-306-80898-6}}. pg. 424.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dave Bradby. ''Modern French Drama: 1940–1990''. Cambridge University Press, 1991. {{ISBN|0-521-40843-1}}. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Esslin402&gt;Esslin, pg. 402&lt;/ref&gt;

The more complex characters are in crisis because the world around them is incomprehensible.&lt;ref name ="Esslin402" /&gt;  Many of Pinter's plays, for example, feature characters trapped in an enclosed space menaced by some force the character can't understand. Pinter's first play was ''[[The Room (play)|The Room]]'' – in which the main character, Rose, is menaced by Riley who invades her safe space though the actual source of menace remains a mystery&lt;ref&gt;Katherine H. Burkman. ''The dramatic world of Harold Pinter: its basis in ritual''. Ohio State University Press, 1971 {{ISBN|0-8142-0146-6}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8142-0146-6}}. pg. 70–73.&lt;/ref&gt; – and this theme of characters in a safe space menaced by an outside force is repeated in many of his later works (perhaps most famously in ''[[The Birthday Party (play)|The Birthday Party]]''). In [[Friedrich Dürrenmatt]]'s ''The Visit'' the main character, Alfred, is menaced by Claire Zachanassian; Claire, richest woman in the world with a decaying body and multiple husbands throughout the play, has guaranteed a payout for anyone in the town willing to kill Alfred.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Alan Crockett. ''Understanding Friedrich Dürrenmatt''.Univ of South Carolina Press, 1998. {{ISBN|1-57003-213-0}}, {{ISBN|978-1-57003-213-4}}. pg.81&lt;/ref&gt; Characters in Absurdist drama may also face the chaos of a world that science and logic have abandoned. Ionesco's recurring character Berenger, for example, faces a killer without motivation in ''[[Tueur sans gages|The Killer]]'', and Berenger's logical arguments fail to convince the killer that killing is wrong.&lt;ref&gt;Leonard Cabell Pronko. ''Avant-garde: the experimental theater in France''. University of California Press, 1966. pg. 96–102.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Rhinoceros (play)|Rhinocéros]]'', Berenger remains the only human on Earth who hasn’t turned into a rhinoceros and must decide whether or not to conform.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Bloom. ''Bloom's Major Dramatists: Eugène Ionesco''. 2003. Infobase Publishing. p106-110.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert B. Heilman. ''The Ghost on the Ramparts''. University of Georgia Press, 2008 {{ISBN|0-8203-3265-8}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8203-3265-9}}. pg. 170–171.&lt;/ref&gt; Characters may find themselves trapped in a routine, or in a metafictional conceit, trapped in a story; the title characters in [[Tom Stoppard]]'s ''[[Rosencrantz &amp; Guildenstern Are Dead]]'', for example, find themselves in a story (''[[Hamlet]]'') in which the outcome has already been written.&lt;ref name = Bradby59&gt;Bradby, ''Modern'' pg. 59&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Victor L. Cahn. ''Beyond Absurdity: The Plays of Tom Stoppard''. London: Associated University Presses, 1979. pg. 36–39. Cahn asserts that though Stoppard begain writing in the Absurdist mode, in his increasing focus on order, optimism, and the redemptive power of art, Stoppard has moved "beyond" Absurdism, as the title implies.&lt;/ref&gt;

The plots of many Absurdist plays feature characters in interdependent pairs, commonly either two males or a male and a female. Some Beckett scholars call this the "pseudocouple".&lt;ref&gt;Ackerley, pg. 334, 465, 508&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alan Astro. ''Understanding Samuel Beckett''. Univ of South Carolina Press, 1990
{{ISBN|0-87249-686-4}}, {{ISBN|978-0-87249-686-6}}. pg. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; The two characters may be roughly equal or have a begrudging interdependence (like Vladimir and Estragon in ''[[Waiting for Godot]]''&lt;ref name="Bradby59" /&gt; or the two main characters in ''[[Rosencrantz &amp; Guildenstern Are Dead]]''); one character may be clearly dominant and may torture the passive character (like Pozzo and Lucky in ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'' or Hamm and Clov in ''[[Endgame (play)|Endgame]]''); the relationship of the characters may shift dramatically throughout the play (as in Ionesco's ''[[La Leçon|The Lesson]]''&lt;ref name = Hinden401&gt;Hinden, pg. 401.&lt;/ref&gt; or in many of Albee's plays, ''[[The Zoo Story]]''&lt;ref name = Kane159&gt;Leslie Kane. ''The language of silence: on the unspoken and the unspeakable in modern drama''. Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press, 1984. {{ISBN|0-8386-3187-8}}. pg. 159–160&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lisa M. Siefker Bailey, Bruce J. Mann. ''Edward Albee: A Casebook''. 2003. Routledge. pg. 33–44.&lt;/ref&gt; for example).

=== Language ===
Despite its reputation for nonsense language, much of the dialogue in Absurdist plays is naturalistic.  The moments when characters resort to nonsense language or clichés—when words appear to have lost their denotative function, thus creating misunderstanding among the characters—make the Theatre of the Absurd distinctive.&lt;ref name="Lewis260" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Esslin, pg. 26&lt;/ref&gt; Language frequently gains a certain phonetic, rhythmical, almost musical quality, opening up a wide range of often comedic playfulness.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Albee, Philip C. Kolin. ''Conversations with Edward Albee''. Univ. Press of Mississippi, 1988. {{ISBN|0-87805-342-5}}. pg. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Jean Tardieu]], for example, in the series of short pieces ''Theatre de Chambre'' arranged the language as one arranges music.&lt;ref&gt;Leonard Cabell Pronko. ''Avant-Garde''. University of California Press, 2003. pg.155–156&lt;/ref&gt; Distinctively Absurdist language ranges from meaningless clichés to vaudeville-style word play to meaningless nonsense.&lt;ref name="Hinden401" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeanette R. Malkin. ''Verbal Violence in Contemporary Drama: From Handke to Shepard''. Cambridge University Press, 1992. {{ISBN|0-521-38335-8}}. pg. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''The Bald Soprano'', for example, was inspired by a language book in which characters would exchange empty clichés that never ultimately amounted to true communication or true connection.&lt;ref&gt;Styan, ''Dark'' pg. 221&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Erich Segal. ''The Death of Comedy''. Harvard University Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-674-01247-X}} pg. 422.&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise, the characters in ''The Bald Soprano''—like many other Absurdist characters—go through routine dialogue full of clichés without actually communicating anything substantive or making a human connection.&lt;ref&gt;Saddik, pg. 30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Guido Almansi, Simon Henderson. ''Harold Pinter''. Routledge, 1983. {{ISBN|0-416-31710-3}}. pg. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases, the dialogue is purposefully elliptical; the language of Absurdist Theater becomes secondary to the poetry of the concrete and objectified images of the stage.&lt;ref&gt;Kane, pg. 17, 19&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of Beckett's plays devalue language for the sake of the striking tableau.&lt;ref&gt;Saddik, pg. 32&lt;/ref&gt;  Harold Pinter—famous for his "Pinter pause"—presents more subtly elliptical dialogue; often the primary things characters should address are replaced by ellipsis or dashes.  The following exchange between Aston and Davies in ''[[The Caretaker]]'' is typical of Pinter:

:ASTON. More or less exactly what you...
:DAVIES.  That's it … that's what I'm getting at is … I mean, what sort of jobs … (''Pause''.)
:ASTON. Well, there's things like the stairs … and the … the bells …
:DAVIES. But it'd be a matter … wouldn't it … it'd be a matter of a broom … isn't it?&lt;ref&gt;Harold Pinter. ''The Caretaker''. DPS, 1991.{{ISBN|0822201844}}, pg. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the dialogue in Absurdist drama (especially in Beckett's and Albee's plays, for example) reflects this kind of evasiveness and inability to make a connection.&lt;ref name="Kane159" /&gt;  When language that is apparently nonsensical appears, it also demonstrates this disconnection.  It can be used for comic effect, as in Lucky's long speech in ''Godot'' when Pozzo says Lucky is demonstrating a talent for "thinking" as other characters comically attempt to stop him:

:LUCKY.  Given the existence as uttered forth in the public works of Puncher and Wattmann of a personal God quaquaquaqua with white beard quaquaquaqua outside time without extension who from the heights of divine apathia divine athambia divine aphasia loves us dearly with some exceptions for reasons unknown but time will tell and suffers like the divine Miranda with those who for reasons unknown but time will tell are plunged in torment...&lt;ref&gt;David Bradby. ''Beckett, Waiting for Godot''. Camberidge University Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-521-59510-X}}, pg. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonsense may also be used abusively, as in Pinter's ''[[The Birthday Party (play)|The Birthday Party]]'' when Goldberg and McCann torture Stanley with apparently nonsensical questions and [[non sequitur (humor)|non-sequiturs]]:

:GOLDBERG.  What do you use for pajamas?
:STANLEY.  Nothing.
:GOLDBERG.  You verminate the sheet of your birth.
:MCCANN.  What about the Albigensenist heresy?
:GOLDBERG.  Who watered the wicket in Melbourne?
:MCCANN.  What about the blessed Oliver Plunkett?
:GOLDBERG.  Speak up Webber.  Why did the chicken cross the road?&lt;ref&gt;Harold Pinter. ''The Birthday Party and The Room: Two Plays''. Grove Press, 1994. {{ISBN|0-8021-5114-0}}. pg. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

As in the above examples, nonsense in Absurdist theatre may be also used to demonstrate the limits of language while questioning or parodying the determinism of science and the knowability of truth.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Williams. "''The Birthday Party'': Harold Pinter". ''Modern Critical Views: Harold Pinter''. New York: Chelsea House Publishers, 1987. {{ISBN|0-87754-706-8}}. pg. 22–23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marc Silverstein. ''Harold Pinter and the language of cultural power''. Bucknell University Press, 1993 {{ISBN|0-8387-5236-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8387-5236-4}}. pg. 33–34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Hornby. ''Drama, Metadrama and perception''. Associated University Presse, 1986 {{ISBN|0-8387-5101-6}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8387-5101-5}}. pg. 61–63.&lt;/ref&gt;  In Ionesco's ''The Lesson'', a professor tries to force a pupil to understand his nonsensical philology lesson:

:PROFESSOR.  … In Spanish: the roses of my grandmother are as yellow as my grandfather who is Asiatic; in Latin: the roses of my grandmother are as yellow as my grandfather who is Asiatic.  Do you detect the difference?  Translate this into … Romanian
:PUPIL.  The … how do you say "roses" in Romanian?
:PROFESSOR.  But "roses", what else? … "roses" is a translation in Oriental of the French word "roses", in Spanish "roses", do you get it? In Sardanapali, "roses"...&lt;ref&gt;Eugène Ionesco. ''The Bald Soprano and Other Plays''. Grove Press, 1982. {{ISBN|0-8021-3079-8}}. pg. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Plot ===
Traditional plot structures are rarely a consideration in The Theatre of the Absurd.&lt;ref&gt;Claude Schumacher. ''Encyclopedia of Literature &amp; Criticism''. 1990. Routledge. pg. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;  Plots can consist of the absurd repetition of cliché and routine, as in ''Godot'' or ''[[The Bald Soprano]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sydney Homan. ''Beckett's theaters: interpretations for performance''. Bucknell University Press, 1984. {{ISBN|0-8387-5064-8}}. pg. 198.&lt;/ref&gt;  Often there is a menacing outside force that remains a mystery; in ''The Birthday Party'', for example, Goldberg and McCann confront Stanley, torture him with absurd questions, and drag him off at the end, but it is never revealed why.&lt;ref&gt;Kane, pg. 132, 134&lt;/ref&gt; In later Pinter plays, such as ''The Caretaker''&lt;ref&gt;Katherine H. Burkman. ''The dramatic world of Harold Pinter: its basis in ritual''. Ohio State University Press, 1971. {{ISBN|0-8142-0146-6}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8142-0146-6}}. pg. 76–89&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Homecoming'',&lt;ref&gt;Marc Silverstein. ''Harold Pinter and the language of cultural power''. Bucknell University Press, 1993.{{ISBN|0-8387-5236-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8387-5236-4}}. pg. 76–94.&lt;/ref&gt; the menace is no longer entering from the outside but exists within the confined space. Other Absurdists use this kind of plot, as in Edward Albee's ''[[A Delicate Balance (play)|A Delicate Balance]]'': Harry and Edna take refuge at the home of their friends Agnes and Tobias because they suddenly become frightened.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen James Bottoms. ''The Cambridge Companion to Edward Albee''. Cambridge University Press, 2005. {{ISBN|0-521-83455-4}}. pg. 221.&lt;/ref&gt;  They have difficulty explaining what has frightened them:

:HARRY: There was nothing … but we were very scared.
:EDNA: We … were … terrified.
:HARRY: We were scared.  It was like being lost: very young again, with the dark, and lost.  There was no … thing … to be … frightened of, but …
:EDNA: WE WERE FRIGHTENED … AND THERE WAS NOTHING.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Albee. ''A delicate balance: a play in three acts''. Samuel French, Inc., 1994. {{ISBN|0-573-60792-3}}. pg. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Absence, emptiness, nothingness, and unresolved mysteries are central features in many Absurdist plots:&lt;ref&gt;Les Essif. ''Empty figure on an empty stage: the theatre of Samuel Beckett and his generation''. Indiana University Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-253-33847-6}}. pg. 1–9&lt;/ref&gt; for example, in ''The Chairs'' an old couple welcomes a large number of guests to their home, but these guests are invisible so all we see is empty chairs, a representation of their absence.&lt;ref&gt;Alice Rayner. ''Ghosts: death's double and the phenomena of theatre''. U of Minnesota Press, 2006. {{ISBN|0-8166-4544-2}}. pg. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise, the action of ''Godot'' is centered around the absence of a man named Godot, for whom the characters perpetually wait.  In many of Beckett's later plays, most features are stripped away and what's left is a minimalistic tableau: a woman walking slowly back and forth in ''[[Footfalls]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Morris Beja, S. E. Gontarski, Pierre A. G. Astier. ''Samuel Beckett—humanistic perspectives''.Ohio State University Press, 1983. {{ISBN|0-8142-0334-5}}. pg. 8&lt;/ref&gt; for example, or in ''[[Breath (play)|Breath]]'' only a junk heap on stage and the sounds of breathing.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Astro. ''Understanding Samuel Beckett''. Univ of South Carolina Press, 1990. {{ISBN|0-87249-686-4}}. pg. 177.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ruby Cohn. ''A Beckett Canon''. University of Michigan Press, 2001. {{ISBN|978-0-472-11190-9}} pg. 298, 337.&lt;/ref&gt;

The plot may also revolve around an unexplained metamorphosis, a supernatural change, or a shift in the laws of physics.  For example, in Ionesco's ''[[Amédée ou comment s'en débarrasser|Amédée, or How to Get Rid of It]]'', a couple must deal with a corpse that is steadily growing larger and larger; Ionesco never fully reveals the identity of the corpse, how this person died, or why it's continually growing, but the corpse ultimately – and, again, without explanation – floats away.&lt;ref&gt;Lamont, pg. 101&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Justin Wintle. ''The Makers of Modern Culture''. Routledge, 2002. {{ISBN|0-415-26583-5}}. pg. 243.&lt;/ref&gt; In Jean Tardieu's "The Keyhole" a lover watches a woman through a keyhole as she removes her clothes and then her flesh.&lt;ref&gt;Pronko, pg. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like Pirandello, many Absurdists use meta-theatrical techniques to explore role fulfillment, fate, and the theatricality of theatre.  This is true for many of Genet's plays: for example, in ''The Maids'', two maids pretend to be their mistress; in ''The Balcony'' brothel patrons take on elevated positions in role-playing games, but the line between theatre and reality starts to blur.  Another complex example of this is ''[[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead]]'': it's a play about two minor characters in ''[[Hamlet]]''; these characters, in turn, have various encounters with the players who perform ''The Mousetrap'', the play-within-the-play in ''Hamlet''.&lt;ref name="Bradby59" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;June Schlueter. ''Metafictional Characters in Modern Drama''. Columbia University Press, 1979. {{ISBN|0-231-04752-5}}. pg. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; In Stoppard's ''Travesties'', James Joyce and Tristan Tzara slip in and out of the plot of ''The Importance of Being Earnest''.&lt;ref&gt;Peter K. W. Tan, Tom Stoppard. ''A stylistics of drama: with special focus on Stoppard's Travesties''. NUS Press, 1993. {{ISBN|9971-69-182-5}}, {{ISBN|978-9971-69-182-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Plots are frequently cyclical:&lt;ref name="Hinden401" /&gt; for example, ''Endgame'' begins where the play ended&lt;ref&gt;Katherine H. Burkman. ''Myth and ritual in the plays of Samuel Beckett''. Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press, 1987. {{ISBN|0-8386-3299-8}}. pg. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; – at the beginning of the play, Clov says, "Finished, it's finished, nearly finished, it must be nearly finished"&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Beckett. ''Endgame: a play in one act, followed by Act without words, a mime for one player''.Grove Press, 1958. {{ISBN|0-8021-5024-1}}. pg. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; – and themes of cycle, routine, and repetition are explored throughout.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Karpati Kennedy|Andrew K. Kennedy]]. ''Samuel Beckett''. Cambridge University Press, 1989. {{ISBN|0-521-27488-5}}. pg. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5999">In [[literature]], the '''tone''' of a literary work is the effect that the writer creates on the readers through choice of writing style. The overall objective is to express an attitude or certain feelings about the subject matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wendy Scheir|title=Roadmap To The California High School Exit Exam: English Language Arts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N1vh2n29bVMC&amp;pg=PA56|year=2004|publisher=The Princeton Review|isbn=978-0-375-76471-4|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Brownstein|1992|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hacker|1991|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Depending upon the personality of the writer and the effect the writer wants to create, the work can be formal or informal, sober or whimsical, assertive or pleading, straightforward or sly.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In determining the attitude, mood, or tone of an author, examine the specific [[diction]] used.  Is the author using adjectives to describe the subject?  If so, are they words like ''fragrant, tranquil, magnanimous''—words with positive [[connotation]]s?  Or are they words like ''fetid, ruffled, stingy''—words with negative connotations?

When we speak, our tone of voice conveys our mood—frustrated, cheerful, critical, gloomy, or angry.  When we write, our images and descriptive phrases get our feelings across—guarded optimism, unqualified enthusiasm, objective indifference, resignation, or dissatisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Brownstein|1992|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other examples of literary tone are:  airy, comic, condescending, facetious, funny, heavy, intimate, ironic, light, playful, sad, serious, sinister, solemn, somber, threatening.

==Difference from mood==
Tone and [[mood (literature)|mood]] are not the same, although they are frequently confused. The mood of a piece of literature is the feeling or atmosphere created by the work, or, said slightly differently, how the work makes the reader feel. Mood is produced most effectively through the use of setting, theme, voice and tone, while tone is how the author feels about something.

==Usage==
All pieces of literature, even official documents and technical documents, have some sort of tone.  Authors create  tone   through the use of various other literary elements, such as ''diction'' or word choice; ''syntax'', the grammatical arrangement of words in a text for effect; ''imagery'', or vivid appeals to the senses; ''details'', facts that are included or omitted; and ''figurative language'', the comparison of  seemingly unrelated things for sub-textual  purposes.{{how|date=October 2013}}

While now used to discuss literature, the term tone was originally applied solely to music. This appropriated word has come to represent attitudes and feelings a speaker (in poetry), a narrator (in fiction), or an author (in non-literary prose) has towards the subject, situation, and/or the intended audience. It is important to recognize that the  speaker, or narrator is not to be confused with the author and that attitudes and feelings of the  speaker or narrator should not be confused with those of the author.{{why |date=October 2013}}  In general, the tone of a piece only refers to attitude of the author if writing is non-literary in nature.{{Elucidate |date=October 2013}}&lt;ref&gt;Booth, Alison, and Kelly J. Mays, eds.  "Theme and Tone." ''The Norton Introduction to Literature'', Portable 10th ed. New York: Norton, 2010. 475-6. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

In many cases, the tone of a work may change and shift as the speaker or narrator’s perspective on a particular subject alters throughout the piece.

Official and technical documentation tends to employ a formal tone throughout the piece.

==Setting tone==
Authors set a tone in literature by conveying emotions/feelings through words. The way a person feels about an idea/concept, event, or another person can be quickly determined through facial expressions, gestures and in the tone of voice used.  In literature an author sets the tone through words.  The possible tones are bounded only by the number of possible [[emotion]]s a human being can have.

Diction and [[syntax]] often dictate what the author's (or character's) attitude toward his subject is at the time. An example: "Charlie surveyed the classroom but it was really his mother congratulating himself for snatching the higher test grade, the smug smirk on his face growing brighter and brighter as he confirmed the inferiority of his peers."

The tone here is one of arrogance; the quip "inferiority of his peers" shows Charlie's belief in his own prowess. The words "surveyed" and "congratulating himself" show Charlie as seeing himself better than the rest of his class.  The diction, including the word "snatching", gives the reader a mental picture of someone quickly and effortlessly grabbing something, which proves once again Charlie's pride in himself. The "smug [[smirk]]" provides a facial imagery of Charlie's pride.

In addition, using imagery in a poem is helpful to develop a poem's tone.

In [[geometry]], the '''trilinear coordinates''' ''x:y:z'' of a point relative to a given [[triangle]] describe the relative [[directed distance]]s from the three [[extended side|sidelines]] of the triangle.  Trilinear coordinates are an example of [[homogeneous coordinates]].  The ratio ''x:y'' is the ratio of the perpendicular distances from the point to the sides ([[extended side|extended]] if necessary) opposite [[vertex (geometry)|vertices]] ''A'' and ''B'' respectively; the ratio ''y:z'' is the ratio of the perpendicular distances from the point to the sidelines opposite vertices ''B'' and ''C'' respectively; and likewise for ''z:x'' and vertices ''C'' and ''A''.

In the diagram at right, the trilinear coordinates of the indicated interior point are the actual distances (''a' '', ''b' '', ''c' ''), or equivalently in ratio form, ''ka' '':''kb' '':''kc' '' for any positive constant ''k''. If a point is on a sideline of the reference triangle, its corresponding trilinear coordinate is 0. If an exterior point is on the opposite side of a sideline from the interior of the triangle, its trilinear coordinate associated with that sideline is negative. It is impossible for all three trilinear coordinates to be non-positive.

The name "trilinear coordinates" is sometimes abbreviated to "trilinears". 

==Notation==

The ratio notation ''x'':''y'':''z'' for trilinear coordinates is different from the ordered triple notation (''a' '', ''b' '', ''c' '') for actual directed distances. Here each of ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' has no meaning by itself; its ratio to one of the others ''does'' have meaning. Thus "comma notation" for trilinear coordinates should be avoided, because the notation (''x'', ''y'', ''z''), which means an ordered triple, does not allow, for example, (''x'', ''y'', ''z'') = (2''x'', 2''y'', 2''z''), whereas the "colon notation" does allow ''x'' : ''y'' : ''z'' = 2''x'' : 2''y'' : 2''z''.

==Examples==

The trilinear coordinates of the [[incenter]] of a triangle ''ABC'' are 1 : 1 : 1; that is, the (directed) distances from the incenter to the sidelines ''BC'', ''CA'', ''AB'' are proportional to the actual distances denoted by (''r'', ''r'', ''r''), where ''r'' is the inradius of triangle ''ABC''. Given side lengths ''a, b, c'' we have:

:* ''A'' = 1 : 0 : 0
:* ''B'' = 0 : 1 : 0
:* ''C'' = 0 : 0 : 1
:* [[incenter]] = 1 : 1 : 1
:* [[centroid]] = ''bc'' : ''ca'' : ''ab'' = 1/''a'' : 1/''b'' : 1/''c'' = csc ''A'' : csc ''B'' : csc ''C''.
:* [[circumcenter]] = cos ''A'' : cos ''B'' : cos ''C''.
:* [[orthocenter]] = sec ''A'' : sec ''B'' : sec ''C''.
:* [[nine-point center]] = cos(''B'' &amp;minus; ''C'') : cos(''C'' &amp;minus; ''A'') : cos(''A'' &amp;minus; ''B'').
:* [[symmedian point]] = ''a'' : ''b'' : ''c'' = sin ''A'' : sin ''B'' : sin ''C''.
:* ''A''-excenter = &amp;minus;1 : 1 : 1
:* ''B''-excenter = 1 : &amp;minus;1 : 1
:* ''C''-excenter = 1 : 1 : &amp;minus;1.

Note that, in general, the incenter is not the same as the [[centroid]]; the centroid has [[Barycentric coordinates (mathematics)|barycentric coordinates]] 1 : 1 : 1 (these being proportional to actual signed areas of the triangles ''BGC'', ''CGA'', ''AGB'', where ''G'' = centroid.)

The midpoint of, for example, side ''BC'' has trilinear coordinates in actual sideline distances  &lt;math&gt;(0 , \frac{\Delta}{b} , \frac{\Delta}{c}) &lt;/math&gt; for triangle area &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt;, which in arbitrarily specified relative distances simplifies to &lt;math&gt;0:ca:ab.&lt;/math&gt; The coordinates in actual sideline distances of the foot of the altitude from ''A'' to ''BC'' are &lt;math&gt;(0, \frac{2\Delta}{a}\cos C, \frac{2\Delta}{a}\cos B),&lt;/math&gt; which in purely relative distances simplifies to &lt;math&gt;0:\cos C:\cos B.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=WW/&gt;{{rp|p. 96}}

==Formulas==

===Collinearities and concurrencies===

Trilinear coordinates enable many algebraic methods in triangle geometry.  For example, three points

:''P = p'' : ''q'' : ''r''
:''U = u'' : ''v'' : ''w''
:''X = x'' : ''y'' : ''z''

are [[collinearity|collinear]] if and only if the [[determinant]]

:&lt;math&gt; D = \begin{vmatrix}p&amp;q&amp;r\\
u&amp;v&amp;w\\x&amp;y&amp;z\end{vmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

equals zero.  Thus if ''x:y:z'' is a variable point, the equation of a line through the points ''P'' and ''U'' is ''D'' = 0.&lt;ref name=WW&gt;William Allen Whitworth (1866) [http://ebooks.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=math;idno=01190002 Trilinear Coordinates and Other Methods of Analytical Geometry of Two Dimensions: an elementary treatise], link from [[Cornell University]] Historical Math Monographs.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p. 23}} From this, every straight line has a linear equation homogeneous in ''x, y, z''.  Every equation of the form ''lx+my+nz'' = 0 in real coefficients is a real straight line of finite points unless ''l : m: n'' is proportional to ''a : b : c'', the side lengths, in which case we have the locus of points at infinity.&lt;ref name=WW/&gt;{{rp|p. 40}}

The dual of this proposition is that the lines

:''pα + qβ + rγ = 0''
:''uα + vβ + wγ = 0'',
:''xα + yβ + zγ = 0''

[[concurrent lines|concur]] in a point (α, β, γ) if and only if ''D'' = 0.&lt;ref name="WW"/&gt;{{rp|p. 28}}

Also, if the actual directed distances are used when evaluating the determinant of ''D'', then the area of triangle ''PUX'' is ''KD'', where ''K'' = ''abc/8∆''&lt;sup&gt;''2''&lt;/sup&gt; (and where ''∆'' is the area of triangle ''ABC'', as above) if triangle ''PUX'' has the same orientation (clockwise or counterclockwise) as triangle ''ABC'', and ''K'' = ''–abc/8∆''&lt;sup&gt;''2''&lt;/sup&gt; otherwise.

===Parallel lines===

Two lines with trilinear equations &lt;math&gt;lx+my+nz=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;l'x+m'y+n'z=0&lt;/math&gt; are parallel if and only if&lt;ref name=WW/&gt;{{rp|p. 98,#xi}}

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{vmatrix}l&amp;m&amp;n\\
l'&amp;m'&amp;n'\\a&amp;b&amp;c\end{vmatrix}=0,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''a, b, c'' are the side lengths.

===Angle between two lines===

The [[tangent (trigonometry)|tangents]] of the angles between two lines with trilinear equations &lt;math&gt;lx+my+nz=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;l'x+m'y+n'z=0&lt;/math&gt; are given by&lt;ref name=WW/&gt;{{rp|p.50}}

:&lt;math&gt;\pm \frac{(mn'-m'n)\sin A + (nl'-n'l)\sin B + (lm'-l'm)\sin C}{ll' + mm' + nn' - (mn'+m'n)\cos A -(nl'+n'l)\cos B - (lm'+l'm)\cos C}.&lt;/math&gt;

====Perpendicular lines====

Thus two lines with trilinear equations &lt;math&gt;lx+my+nz=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;l'x+m'y+n'z=0&lt;/math&gt; are perpendicular if and only if

:&lt;math&gt;ll'+mm'+nn'-(mn'+m'n)\cos A-(nl'+n'l)\cos B-(lm'+l'm)\cos C=0.&lt;/math&gt;

===Altitude===

The equation of the [[altitude (geometry)|altitude]] from vertex ''A'' to side ''BC'' is&lt;ref name=WW/&gt;{{rp|p.98,#x}}

:&lt;math&gt;y\cos B-z\cos C=0.&lt;/math&gt;

===Line in terms of distances from vertices===

The equation of a line with variable distances ''p, q, r'' from the vertices ''A'', ''B'', ''C'' whose opposite sides are ''a, b, c'' is&lt;ref name=WW/&gt;{{rp|p. 97,#viii}}

:&lt;math&gt;apx+bqy+crz=0.&lt;/math&gt;

===Actual-distance trilinear coordinates===

The trilinears with the coordinate values ''a', b', c' ''  being the actual perpendicular distances to the sides satisfy&lt;ref name=WW/&gt;{{rp|p. 11}}

:&lt;math&gt;aa' +bb' + cc' =2\Delta&lt;/math&gt;

for triangle sides ''a, b, c'' and area &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt;. This can be seen in the figure at the top of this article, with interior point ''P'' partitioning triangle ''ABC'' into three triangles ''PBC'', ''PCA'', and ''PAB'' with respective areas (1/2)''aa' '', (1/2)''bb' '', and (1/2)''cc' ''.

===Distance between two points===

The distance ''d'' between two points with actual-distance trilinears ''a' ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; : ''b' ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; : ''c' ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is given by&lt;ref name=WW/&gt;{{rp|p. 46}}

:&lt;math&gt;d^2\sin ^2 C=(a'_1-a'_2)^2+(b'_1-b'_2)^2+2(a'_1-a'_2)(b'_1-b'_2)\cos C.&lt;/math&gt;

===Distance from a point to a line===

The distance ''d'' from a point ''a' ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; : ''b' ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; : ''c' ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, in trilinear coordinates of actual distances, to a straight line ''lx + my + nz'' = 0 is&lt;ref name=WW/&gt;{{rp|p. 48}}

:&lt;math&gt;d=\frac{la'_0+mb'_0+nc'_0}{\sqrt{l^2+m^2+n^2-2mn\cos A -2nl\cos B -2lm\cos C}}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Quadratic curves===

The equation of a [[conic section]] in the variable trilinear point ''x'' : ''y'' : ''z'' is&lt;ref name=WW/&gt;{{rp|p.118}}

:&lt;math&gt;rx^2+sy^2+tz^2+2uyz+2vzx+2wxy=0.&lt;/math&gt;

It has no linear terms and no constant term.

The equation of a circle of radius ''r'' having center at actual-distance coordinates (''a', b', c' '') is&lt;ref name=WW/&gt;{{rp|p.287}}

:&lt;math&gt;(x-a')^2\sin 2A+(y-b')^2\sin 2B+(z-c')^2\sin 2C=2r^2\sin A\sin B\sin C.&lt;/math&gt;

====Circumconics====

The equation in trilinear coordinates ''x, y, z'' of any [[circumconic]] of a triangle is&lt;ref name=WW/&gt;{{rp|p. 192}}

:&lt;math&gt;lyz+mzx+nxy=0.&lt;/math&gt;

If the parameters ''l, m, n'' respectively equal the side lengths ''a, b, c'' (or the sines of the angles opposite them) then the equation gives the [[circumcircle]].&lt;ref name=WW/&gt;{{rp|p. 199}}

Each distinct circumconic has a center unique to itself. The equation in trilinear coordinates of the circumconic with center ''x' :  y' : z' '' is&lt;ref name=WW/&gt;{{rp|p. 203}}

:&lt;math&gt;yz(x'-y'-z')+zx(y'-z'-x')+xy(z'-x'-y')=0.&lt;/math&gt;

====Inconics====

Every conic section [[inscribed figure|inscribed]] in a triangle has an equation in trilinear coordinates&lt;ref name=WW/&gt;{{rp|p. 208}}

:&lt;math&gt;l^2x^2+m^2y^2+n^2z^2 \pm 2mnyz \pm 2nlzx\pm 2lmxy =0,&lt;/math&gt;

with exactly one or three of the unspecified signs being negative.

The equation of the [[incircle]] can be simplified to&lt;ref name=WW/&gt;{{rp|p. 210, p.214}}

:&lt;math&gt;\pm \sqrt{x}\cos \frac{A}{2}\pm \sqrt{y}\cos \frac{B}{2}\pm\sqrt{z}\cos \frac{C}{2}=0,&lt;/math&gt;

while the equation for, for example, the [[excircle]] adjacent to the side segment opposite vertex ''A'' can be written as&lt;ref name= WW/&gt;{{rp|p. 215}}

:&lt;math&gt;\pm \sqrt{-x}\cos \frac{A}{2}\pm \sqrt{y}\cos \frac{B}{2}\pm\sqrt{z}\cos \frac{C}{2}=0.&lt;/math&gt;

===Cubic curves===
Many cubic curves are easily represented using trilinear coordinates.  For example, the pivotal self-isoconjugate cubic ''Z(U,P)'', as the locus of a point ''X'' such that the ''P''-isoconjugate of ''X'' is on the line ''UX'' is given by the determinant equation

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{vmatrix}x&amp;y&amp;z\\

Among named cubics ''Z(U,P)'' are the following:

: Thomson cubic: ''Z(X(2),X(1))'', where ''X(2) = ''[[centroid]], ''X(1) = ''[[incenter]]
: Feuerbach cubic: ''Z(X(5),X(1))'', where ''X(5) = ''[[Feuerbach point]]
: Darboux cubic: ''Z(X(20),X(1))'', where ''X(20) = ''[[De Longchamps point]]
: Neuberg cubic: ''Z(X(30),X(1))'', where ''X(30) = ''[[Euler infinity point]].

==Conversions==

===Between trilinear coordinates and distances from sidelines===

For any choice of trilinear coordinates ''x:y:z'' to locate a point, the actual distances of the point from the sidelines are given by ''a' = kx'', ''b' = ky'', ''c' = kz'' where ''k'' can be determined by the formula &lt;math&gt;k = \frac{2\Delta}{ax + by + cz}&lt;/math&gt; in which ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' are the respective sidelengths ''BC'', ''CA'', ''AB'', and ∆ is the area of ''ABC''.

===Between barycentric and trilinear coordinates===
A point with trilinear coordinates ''x'' : ''y'' : ''z'' has [[barycentric coordinates (mathematics)|barycentric coordinates]] ''ax'' : ''by'' : ''cz'' where ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' are the sidelengths of the triangle.  Conversely, a point with barycentrics ''α'' : ''β'' : ''γ'' has trilinear coordinates ''α/a'' : ''β/b'' : ''γ/c''.

===Between Cartesian and trilinear coordinates===
Given a reference triangle ''ABC'', express the position of the vertex ''B'' in terms of an ordered pair of [[Cartesian coordinates]] and represent this algebraically as a [[vector (geometric)|vector]] &lt;u&gt;''B''&lt;/u&gt;, using vertex ''C'' as the origin. Similarly define the position vector of vertex ''A'' as &lt;u&gt;''A''&lt;/u&gt;. Then any point ''P'' associated with the reference triangle ''ABC'' can be defined in a Cartesian system as a vector &lt;u&gt;''P''&lt;/u&gt; = ''k''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;u&gt;''A''&lt;/u&gt; + ''k''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;u&gt;''B''&lt;/u&gt;. If this point ''P'' has trilinear coordinates ''x : y : z'' then the conversion formula from the coefficients ''k''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''k''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the Cartesian representation to the trilinear coordinates is, for side lengths ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' opposite vertices ''A'', ''B'', ''C'',

: &lt;math&gt;x:y:z = \frac{k_1}{a} : \frac{k_2}{b} : \frac{1 - k_1 - k_2}{c}, &lt;/math&gt;

and the conversion formula from the trilinear coordinates to the coefficients in the Cartesian representation is

: &lt;math&gt;k_1 = \frac{ax}{ax + by + cz}, \quad k_2 = \frac{by}{ax + by + cz}.&lt;/math&gt;

More generally, if an arbitrary origin is chosen where the Cartesian coordinates of the vertices are known and represented by the vectors &lt;u&gt;''A''&lt;/u&gt;, &lt;u&gt;''B''&lt;/u&gt; and &lt;u&gt;''C''&lt;/u&gt; and if the point ''P'' has trilinear coordinates ''x'' : ''y'' : ''z'', then the Cartesian coordinates of &lt;u&gt;''P''&lt;/u&gt; are the weighted average of the Cartesian coordinates of these vertices using the barycentric coordinates ''ax'', ''by'' and ''cz'' as the weights. Hence the conversion formula from the trilinear coordinates ''x, y, z''  to the vector of Cartesian coordinates &lt;u&gt;''P''&lt;/u&gt; of the point is given by

: &lt;math&gt;\underline{P}=\frac{ax}{ax+by+cz}\underline{A}+\frac{by}{ax+by+cz}\underline{B}+\frac{cz}{ax+by+cz}\underline{C},&lt;/math&gt;
where the side lengths are |&lt;u&gt;''C''&lt;/u&gt; − &lt;u&gt;''B''&lt;/u&gt;| = ''a'', |&lt;u&gt;''A''&lt;/u&gt; − &lt;u&gt;''C''&lt;/u&gt;| = ''b'' and |&lt;u&gt;''B''&lt;/u&gt; − &lt;u&gt;''A''&lt;/u&gt;| = ''c''.

In [[statistical process control|statistical quality control]], the '''u-chart''' is a type of [[control chart]] used to monitor "count"-type data where the sample size is greater than one, typically the average number of nonconformities per unit.

The u-chart differs from the [[c-chart]] in that it accounts for the possibility that the number or size of inspection units for which nonconformities are to be counted may vary.  Larger samples may be an economic necessity or may be necessary to increase the area of opportunity in order to track very low nonconformity levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Montgomery | first = Douglas | title = Introduction to Statistical Quality Control | publisher = [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]], Inc. | year = 2005 | location = [[Hoboken, New Jersey]] | pages = 294 | url = http://www.eas.asu.edu/~masmlab/montgomery/ | isbn = 978-0-471-65631-9 | oclc = 56729567 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080620095346/http://www.eas.asu.edu/~masmlab/montgomery/ | archivedate = 2008-06-20 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of processes suitable for monitoring with a u-chart include:
*Monitoring the number of nonconformities per lot of raw material received where the lot size varies
*Monitoring the number of new infections in a hospital per day
*Monitoring the number of accidents for delivery trucks per day

As with the c-chart, the [[Poisson distribution]] is the basis for the chart and requires the same assumptions.

The control limits for this chart type are &lt;math&gt;\bar u \pm 3\sqrt{\frac{\bar u}{n}}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\bar u&lt;/math&gt; is the estimate of the long-term process mean established during control-chart setup.  The observations &lt;math&gt;u_i = \frac{x_i}{n_i}&lt;/math&gt; are plotted against these control limits, where x&lt;SUB&gt;i&lt;/SUB&gt; is the number of nonconformities for the ith subgroup and n&lt;SUB&gt;i&lt;/SUB&gt; is the number of inspection units in the ith subgroup.

[[File:Vehicle License of the People's Republic of China (Information Page).jpg|thumb|VIN is recorded in Vehicle License of China.]]

A '''vehicle identification number''' ('''VIN''') is a unique code, including a [[serial number]], used by the [[automotive industry]] to identify individual [[motor vehicle]]s, [[Trailer (vehicle)|towed vehicles]], [[motorcycle]]s, [[Scooter (motorcycle)|scooters]]  and [[moped]]s, as defined in [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 3779 (content and structure) and ISO 4030 (location and attachment).

VINs were first used in 1954 in the United States.&lt;ref name="nhtsa1"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://vpic.nhtsa.dot.gov/| title = Vehicle Identification Numbers (VINs) | access-date = 2011-07-24 | publisher = National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1954 to 1981, there was no accepted standard for these numbers, so different manufacturers used different formats.

In 1981, the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] of the United States standardized the format.&lt;ref name="nhtsa1"/&gt; It required all on-road vehicles sold to contain a 17-character VIN, which does not include the letters I (i), O (o), and Q (q) (to avoid confusion with numerals 1 and 0).

There are vehicle history services in several countries that help potential car owners use VINs to find vehicles that are defective or have been [[vehicle title branding|written off]]. See the [[Used car]] article for a list of countries where this service is available.

==Classification==
There are at least four competing standards used to calculate the VIN.
* [[FMVSS]] 115, Part 565: Used in United States and Canada&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=18b4d0415b77325b50963d4312e0a382&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt49.6.565&amp;rgn=div5 |title=eCFR – Code of Federal Regulations – Title 49: Transportation – PART 565—VEHICLE IDENTIFICATION NUMBER (VIN) REQUIREMENTS |publisher=www.ecfr.gov |date= |access-date=2013-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] Standard 3779: Used in Europe and many other parts of the world
* [[SAE International|SAE]] J853: Very similar to the ISO standard
* [[Australian Design Rules|ADR]] 61/2 used in Australia, referring to ISO 3779 and 3780&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comlaw.gov.au/ComLaw/Legislation/LegislativeInstrument1.nsf/asmade/bytitle/AB342EFD35B8719ECA2570CF007BE90F?OpenDocument |title=ComLaw Legislative Instruments – Vehicle Standard (Australian Design Rule 61/02 – Vehicle Marking) 2005 (ADR 61/02) |publisher=Comlaw.gov.au |date= |access-date=2010-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Components==
Modern VINs are based on two related standards, originally issued by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) in 1979 and 1980: ISO 3779&lt;ref&gt;ISO 3779:2009 Road vehicles—Vehicle identification number (VIN)—Content and structure&lt;/ref&gt; and ISO 3780,&lt;ref&gt;ISO 3780:2009 Road vehicles—World manufacturer identifier (WMI) code&lt;/ref&gt; respectively. Compatible but different implementations of these ISO standards have been adopted by the [[European Union]] and the [[United States]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_05/49cfr565_05.html |title=United States Federal VIN Requirements (Title 49, Chapter V, Part 565) |publisher=Access.gpo.gov |date= |access-date=2010-09-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527210905/http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_05/49cfr565_05.html |archive-date=2010-05-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World manufacturer identifier===
The first three characters uniquely identify the [[manufacturer]] of the vehicle using the world manufacturer identifier or WMI code. A manufacturer who builds fewer than 1000 vehicles per year uses a 9 as the third digit, and the 12th, 13th and 14th position of the VIN for a second part of the identification. Some manufacturers use the third character as a code for a vehicle category (e.g., bus or truck), a division within a manufacturer, or both. For example, within 1G (assigned to [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] in the United States), 1G1 represents [[Chevrolet]] passenger cars; 1G2, [[Pontiac]] passenger cars; and 1GC, Chevrolet [[truck]]s.

The [[Society of Automotive Engineers]] (SAE) in the U.S. assigns WMIs to countries and manufacturers.&lt;ref name=ISO3780&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.iso.org/standard/45844.html |title=ISO 3780:2009 Road vehicles – World manufacturer identifier (WMI) code |publisher=[[ISO]] |date=2009-10-05 |access-date=2010-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first character of the WMI is the region in which the manufacturer is located. In practice, each is assigned to a country of manufacture, although in Europe the country where the continental headquarters is located can assign the WMI to all vehicles produced in that region (Example: Opel/Vauxhall cars whether produced in Germany, Spain, the United Kingdom or Poland carry a WMI of ''W0L'' because Adam Opel AG is based in Rüsselsheim, Germany).

In the notation below, assume that letters precede numbers and that zero is the last number. For example, 8X–82 denotes the range 8X, 8Y, 8Z, 81, 82, excluding 80.

===Vehicle descriptor section===
The fourth to ninth positions in the VIN are the vehicle descriptor section or VDS. This is used, according to local regulations, to identify the vehicle type, and may include information on the [[automobile platform]] used, the model, and the [[car body styles|body style]]. Each manufacturer has a unique system for using this field. Most manufacturers since the 1980s have used the eighth digit to identify the engine type whenever there is more than one engine choice for the vehicle. Example: for the 2007 [[Chevrolet Corvette]], U is for a 6.0-liter [[V8 engine|V8]] engine, and E is for a 7.0&amp;nbsp;L V8.

====North American check digits====
One element that is fairly consistent is the use of position nine as a [[#Check-digit calculation|check digit]], compulsory for vehicles in North America and China, and used fairly consistently elsewhere.

===Vehicle identifier section===
The 10th to 17th positions are used as the 'vehicle identifier section' (VIS). This is used by the manufacturer to identify the individual vehicle in question. This may include information on options installed or engine and transmission choices, but often is a simple sequential number. In North America, the last five digits must be numeric.

====Model year encoding====
One consistent element of the VIS is the 10th digit, which is required worldwide to encode the [[#Model year encoding|model year]] of the vehicle. Besides the three letters that are not allowed in the VIN itself (I, O and Q), the letters U and Z and the digit 0 are not used for the [[model year]] code. The year code is the model year for the vehicle.

The year 1980 was encoded by some manufacturers, especially [[General Motors]] and [[Chrysler]], as "A" (since the 17-digit VIN was not mandatory until 1981, and the "A" or zero was in the manufacturer's pre-1981 placement in the VIN), yet [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] and [[American Motors Corporation|AMC]] still used a zero for 1980. Subsequent years increment through the allowed letters, so that "Y" represents the year 2000. 2001 to 2009 are encoded as the digits 1 to 9, and subsequent years are encoded as "A", "B", "C", etc.

On April 30, 2008, the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration adopted a final rule amending 49 CFR Part 565, "so that the current 17 character vehicle identification number (VIN) system, which has been in place for almost 30 years, can continue in use for at least another 30 years", in the process making several changes to the VIN requirements applicable to all motor vehicles manufactured for sale in the United States. There are three notable changes to the VIN structure that affect VIN deciphering systems:
* The make may only be identified after looking at positions one through three and another position, as determined by the manufacturer in the second section or fourth to eighth segment of the VIN.
* In order to identify the exact year in passenger cars and multipurpose passenger vehicles with a GVWR of 10,000 or less, one must read position 7 as well as position 10. For passenger cars, and for multipurpose passenger vehicles and trucks with a gross vehicle weight rating of {{convert|10000|lb|abbr=on}} or less, if position seven is numeric, the model year in position 10 of the VIN refers to a year in the range 1980–2009.{{Citation needed|reason=Seems wrong as e.g. a 2013 Volvo V60 has YV1xxx7xxDxxxxxxx|date=May 2017}} If position seven is alphabetic, the model year in position 10 of VIN refers to a year in the range 2010–2039.
* The model year for vehicles with a GVWR greater than {{convert|10000|lb|abbr=on}}, as well as buses, motorcycles, trailers and low-speed vehicles, may no longer be identified within a 30-year range. VIN characters 1–8 and 10 that were assigned from 1980–2009 can be repeated beginning with the 2010 model year.

====Plant code====
Compulsory in North America and China is the use of the 11th character to identify the factory at which the vehicle was built. Each manufacturer has its own set of plant codes.

====Production number====
In the United States and China, the 12th to 17th digits are the vehicle's serial or production number. This is unique to each vehicle, and every manufacturer uses its own sequence.

==Check-digit calculation==
Check-digit validation is compulsory for all road vehicles sold in North America.

When trying to validate a VIN with a [[check digit]], first either (a) remove the check digit for the purpose of calculation or (b) use a weight of zero (see [[#Weights used in calculation|below]]) to cancel it out. The original value of the check digit is then compared with the calculated value. If the calculated value is 0–9, the check digit must match the calculated value. If the calculated value is 10, the check digit must be X. If the two values do not match (and there was no error in the calculation), then there is a mistake in the VIN. However, a match does not prove the VIN is correct, because there is still a 1/11 chance that any two distinct VINs have a matching check digit: for example, the valid VINs &lt;tt&gt;5GZCZ43D13S812715&lt;/tt&gt; (correct with leading five) and &lt;tt&gt;SGZCZ43D13S812715&lt;/tt&gt; (incorrect with leading character "S"). The VINs in the Porsche image, &lt;tt&gt;WP0ZZZ99ZTS392124&lt;/tt&gt;, and the GM-T body image, &lt;tt&gt;KLATF08Y1VB363636&lt;/tt&gt;, do not pass the North American check-digit verification.

===Transliterating the numbers===
Transliteration consists of removing all of the letters, and replacing them with their appropriate numerical counterparts. These numerical alternatives (based on IBM's [[EBCDIC]]) are in the following chart. ''I'', ''O'', and ''Q'' are not allowed in a valid VIN; for this chart, they have been filled in with ''N/A'' (''not applicable''). Numerical digits use their own values.

{|class="wikitable"
|+Transliteration key:&amp;nbsp;values for VIN decoding
|'''A''': 1 ||'''B''': 2 ||'''C''': 3 ||'''D''': 4 ||'''E''': 5 ||'''F''': 6 ||'''G''': 7 ||'''H''': 8 ||'''I''': {{n/a}}
|-
|'''J''': 1 ||'''K''': 2 ||'''L''': 3 ||'''M''': 4 ||'''N''': 5 ||'''O''': {{n/a}} ||'''P''': 7 ||'''Q''': {{n/a}} ||'''R''': 9
|-
|{{n/a}} ||'''S''': 2 ||'''T''': 3 ||'''U''': 4 ||'''V''': 5 || '''W''': 6||'''X''': 7 ||'''Y''': 8 || '''Z''': 9
|}

''S'' is 2, and not 1. There is no left-alignment linearity.

===Weights used in calculation===
The following is the weight factor for each position in the VIN. The 9th position is that of the check digit. It has been substituted with a 0, which will cancel it out in the multiplication step.

|-

|}

===Worked example===
Consider the hypothetical VIN 1M8GDM9A_KP042788, where the underscore will be the check digit.

{|class="wikitable" style="font-size:1.2em;font-family:monospace"
|-
!VIN
||1||M||8||G||D||M||9||A|| ||K||P||0||4||2||7||8||8
|-
!Value
||1||4||8||7||4||4||9||1||0||2||7||0||4||2||7||8||8
|-
!Weight
||8||7||6||5||4||3||2||10||0||9||8||7||6||5||4||3||2
|-
!Products
||8&amp;nbsp;||28||48||35||16||12||18||10||0&amp;nbsp;||18||56||0&amp;nbsp;||24||10||28||24||16
|}

# The VIN's value is calculated from the above transliteration table. This number is used in the rest of the calculation.
# Copy the ''weights'' from the above weight factor table.
# The ''products'' row is the result of the multiplication of the vertical columns: ''Value'' and ''Weight.''
# The products (8, 28, 48, 35 ... 24, 16) are all added together to yield a sum, ''351''.
# Find the remainder after dividing by 11&lt;br/&gt;351 [[modulo operation|MOD]] 11 = 10&lt;br/&gt;351 ÷ 11 = 31 &lt;sup&gt;'''10'''&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;
# The remainder is the check digit. If the remainder is 10, the check digit is X. In this example, the remainder is 10, so the check digit is transliterated as ''X''.

With a check digit of ''X'', the VIN &lt;tt&gt;1M8GDM9A_KP042788&lt;/tt&gt; is written &lt;tt&gt;1M8GDM9A''X''KP042788&lt;/tt&gt;.

A VIN with ''straight-ones'' (seventeen consecutive ''1''s) has the nice feature that its check digit ''1'' matches the calculated value ''1''. This is because a value of one multiplied by 89 (sum of weights) is 89, and 89 divided by 11 is 8 with remainder {{frac|1|11}}; thus 1 is the check digit. This is a way to test a VIN-check algorithm.

===Example code===

;Java

&lt;source lang="Java"&gt;
private static int transliterate(char c) {
	return "0123456789.ABCDEFGH..JKLMN.P.R..STUVWXYZ".indexOf(c) % 10;
}

private static char getCheckDigit(String vin) {
	String map = "0123456789X";
	String weights = "8765432X098765432";
	int sum = 0;
	for (int i = 0; i &lt; 17; ++i) {
		sum += transliterate(vin.charAt(i)) * map.indexOf(weights.charAt(i));
	}
	return map.charAt(sum % 11);
}

private static boolean validate(String vin) {
    if(vin.length()!=17) return false;
	return getCheckDigit(vin) == vin.charAt(8);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;!-- No more examples in your favourite language; one is plenty to understand the algorithm --&gt;

==VIN scanning==
VINs may be optically read with barcode scanners or digital cameras, or digitally read via [[OBD-II]] in newer vehicles. There are smartphone applications that can pass the VIN to websites to decode the VIN.

==List of common WMI==
The [[Society of Automotive Engineers]] (SAE) assigns the WMI (world manufacturer identifier) to countries and manufacturers. The following list shows a small selection of world manufacturer codes.

[[File:'The feast of reason, and the flow of soul,' - ie - the wits of the age, setting the table in a roar by James Gillray.jpg|thumb|'The feast of reason, and the flow of soul,' - i.e. - the wits of the age, setting the table in a roar, by [[James Gillray]] (1797)]]

'''Wit''' is a form of intelligent [[humour]], the ability to say or write things that are clever and usually funny.&lt;ref name="Merriam-Webster"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.learnersdictionary.com/search/wit|title=Wit|publisher=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=2012-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; A '''wit''' is a person skilled at making clever and funny remarks.&lt;ref name="Merriam-Webster"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=wit|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/wit|website=Oxford Dictionaries|accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forms of wit include the '''quip''', '''repartee''', and '''wisecrack'''.

==Forms==
As in the wit of [[Dorothy Parker]]'s set, the [[Algonquin Round Table]], witty remarks may be intentionally cruel (as in many [[epigram]]s), and perhaps more [[genius|ingenious]] than funny.

A quip is an observation or saying that has some wit but perhaps descends into [[sarcasm]], or otherwise is short of a point, and a witticism also suggests the diminutive. Repartee is the wit of the quick answer and capping comment: the snappy comeback and neat retort. ([[Oscar Wilde|Wilde]]: "I wish I'd said that." [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler|Whistler]]: "You will, Oscar, you will".)&lt;ref&gt;Monty Python: Oscar Wilde sketch&lt;/ref&gt;

==In poetry==
Wit in [[poetry]] is characteristic of [[metaphysical poetry]] as a style, and was prevalent in the time of English playwright [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], who admonished pretension with the phrase "Better a witty fool than a foolish wit".&lt;ref name="Salingar1976"&gt;{{cite book
|last=Salingar
|first=Leo
|title=Shakespeare and the Traditions of Comedy
|url=
|year=1976
|publisher=Cambridge University Press
|isbn=978-0-521-29113-2
|pages=245–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may combine [[word play]] with conceptual thinking, as a kind of verbal display requiring attention, without intending to be laugh-aloud funny; in fact wit can be a thin disguise for more poignant feelings that are being versified. English poet [[John Donne]] is the representative of this style of poetry.&lt;ref name="Daley1990"&gt;{{cite book
|last=Daley
|first=Koos
|title=The triple fool: a critical evaluation of Constantijn Huygens' translations of John Donne

|accessdate=6 October 2010
|year=1990
|publisher=De Graaf
|isbn=978-90-6004-405-6
|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Further meanings==
More generally, one's wits are one's intellectual powers of all types. Native wit &amp;mdash; meaning the wits with which one is born &amp;mdash; is closely synonymous with [[common sense]]. To live by one's wits is to be an [[Opportunism|opportunist]], but not always of the scrupulous kind. To have one's wits about one is to be alert and capable of quick [[reasoning]].  To be at the end of one's wits ("I'm at my wits' end") is to be immensely [[Frustration|frustrated]].

In [[statistical process control|statistical quality control]], the '''&lt;math&gt;\bar x&lt;/math&gt; and R chart''' is a type of [[control chart]] used to monitor [[Variable and attribute (research)|variables data]] when samples are collected at regular intervals from a [[Business process|business]] or [[List of industrial processes|industrial process]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/pmc/section3/pmc321.htm|title=Shewhart X-bar and R and S Control Charts|accessdate=2009-01-13|work=NIST/Sematech Engineering Statistics Handbook]|publisher=[[National Institute of Standards and Technology]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chart is advantageous in the following situations:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Montgomery | first = Douglas | title = Introduction to Statistical Quality Control | publisher = [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]], Inc. | year = 2005 | location = [[Hoboken, New Jersey]] | pages = 222 | url = http://www.eas.asu.edu/~masmlab/montgomery/ | isbn = 978-0-471-65631-9 | oclc = 56729567}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#The sample size is relatively small (say, n ≤ 10—[[Xbar and s chart|&lt;math&gt;\bar x&lt;/math&gt; and s charts]] are typically used for larger sample sizes)
#The sample size is constant
#Humans must perform the calculations for the chart

The "chart" actually consists of a pair of charts: One to monitor the process standard deviation (as approximated by the sample [[Range (statistics)|moving range]]) and another to monitor the process mean, as is done with the [[Xbar and s chart|&lt;math&gt;\bar x&lt;/math&gt; and s]] and [[Shewhart individuals control chart|individuals control chart]]s. The &lt;math&gt;\bar x&lt;/math&gt; and R chart plots the mean value for the quality characteristic across all units in the sample, &lt;math&gt;\bar x_i&lt;/math&gt;, plus the range of the quality characteristic across all units in the sample as follows:
:R = x&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; - x&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt;.

The [[normal distribution]] is the basis for the charts and requires the following assumptions:
*The quality characteristic to be monitored is adequately modeled by a [[Normal distribution|normally distributed]] [[random variable]]
*The parameters μ and σ for the random variable are the same for each unit and each unit is independent of its predecessors or successors
*The inspection procedure is same for each sample and is carried out consistently from sample to sample

The control limits for this chart type are:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Montgomery | first = Douglas | title = Introduction to Statistical Quality Control | publisher = [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]], Inc. | year = 2005 | location = [[Hoboken, New Jersey]] | pages = 197 | url = http://www.eas.asu.edu/~masmlab/montgomery/ | isbn = 978-0-471-65631-9 | oclc = 56729567}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;D_3 \bar R&lt;/math&gt; (lower) and &lt;math&gt;D_4 \bar R&lt;/math&gt; (upper) for monitoring the process variability
*&lt;math&gt;\bar x \pm A_2 \bar R&lt;/math&gt; for monitoring the process mean
:where &lt;math&gt;\bar x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\bar R = \frac {\sum_{i=1}^m \left ( R_{max} - R_{min} \right )}{m}&lt;/math&gt; are the estimates of the long-term process mean and range established during control-chart setup and A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and D&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; are sample size-specific [[Unbiased estimation of standard deviation|anti-biasing]] constants. The anti-biasing constants are typically found in the appendices of textbooks on [[statistical process control]].

As with the [[Xbar and s chart|&lt;math&gt;\bar x&lt;/math&gt; and s]] and [[Shewhart individuals control chart|individuals control chart]]s, the &lt;math&gt;\bar x&lt;/math&gt; chart is only valid if the within-sample variability is constant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Montgomery | first = Douglas | title = Introduction to Statistical Quality Control | publisher = [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]], Inc. | year = 2005 | location = [[Hoboken, New Jersey]] | pages = 214 | url = http://www.eas.asu.edu/~masmlab/montgomery/ | isbn = 978-0-471-65631-9 | oclc = 56729567}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the R chart is examined before the &lt;math&gt;\bar x&lt;/math&gt; chart; if the R chart indicates the sample variability is in statistical control, then the &lt;math&gt;\bar x&lt;/math&gt; chart is examined to determine if the sample mean is also in statistical control. If on the other hand, the sample variability is ''not'' in statistical control, then the entire process is judged to be not in statistical control regardless of what the &lt;math&gt;\bar x&lt;/math&gt; chart indicates.
