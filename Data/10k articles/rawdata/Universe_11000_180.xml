==Facility==
After oil was discovered at Aliso Canyon in 1938, [[J. Paul Getty]]'s Tidewater Associated Oil Company produced oil and gas until the Sesnon-Frew reservoir, the largest reservoir within the [[oil field]], was depleted in the early 1970s. On December 18, 1968, a blowout and fire, destroying equipment but causing no injuries, occurred at one of the wells when an operator attempted to remove two gas-lift valves.&lt;ref name=lat&gt;{{cite news|author1=Zahira Torres, Frank Shyong|title=Leaking gas well in Porter Ranch area lacked a working safety valve|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-0104-gas-leak-20160104-story.html|accessdate=January 20, 2016|newspaper=The Los Angeles Times|date=January 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Getty sold his portion of the field to [[Pacific Lighting Company]], a gas company, which repurposed it to gas storage in 1972. As opposed to current practice, older wells were not sealed to the surrounding rock formation, including their often more than one mile of steel casing. Today, "cement from the surface of the ground to the bottom of the well [...] makes the casings stronger and protects them from water."&lt;ref name=maddaus/&gt; The Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility contains 115 wells tapping a reservoir that "hold[s] up to 86 billion cubic feet of natural gas for distribution to residences, businesses, and electric utilities in the L.A. basin".&lt;ref name=ud&gt;{{cite news|author1=Herman K. Trabish|title=Historic Los Angeles methane leak puts natural gas emissions under scrutiny|url=http://www.utilitydive.com/news/historic-los-angeles-methane-leak-puts-natural-gas-emissions-under-scrutiny/411060/|accessdate=January 20, 2016|work=Utility Dive|publisher=Industry Dive|date=December 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field is the second largest storage facility of its kind in the United States.&lt;ref name=abrams/&gt;

==Discovery of leak==
Southern California Gas Company said the leak in well SS-25 was discovered "on October 23 during one of its twice-daily well observations."&lt;ref name=ud/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;South Coast Air Quality Management District (23 January 2016)[http://www.aqmd.gov/home/library/public-information/2016-news-archives/aliso-canyon-hb-order-issued-pr SCAQMD Hearing Board Orders SoCalGas to Enact Comprehensive Program to Cut Odors and Air Pollution from Aliso Canyon Gas Leak ]&lt;/ref&gt; Residents of the nearby Porter Ranch reported what they thought was a home with a major leak on October 23, 2015. SoCal Gas "went from home to home to home, giving everybody the A-OK and [...] didn't admit to having a gas leak until [...] probably around the 28th of October."&lt;ref&gt;Amy Goodman [http://www.democracynow.org/2015/12/30/erin_brockovich_california_methane_gas_leak Erin Brockovich: California Methane Gas Leak is Worst U.S. Environmental Disaster Since BP Oil Spill] Democracy Now, December 30, 2015, retrieved January 11, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Local residents believed the gas blowout started before SoCalGas admitted to discovering it, and many residents reported having unexplained illnesses a week or so earlier. According to [[KPCC|KPCC's]] website, some residents posted complaints of earlier symptoms on a Porter Ranch gas leak Facebook page.&lt;ref name="scpr.org"/&gt;

This event has been called a blowout in several news reports. For instance, an February 2016 article in The Orange County Register called "Gas facility that had blowout over Porter Ranch will have to play by new rules." stated "in the case of the blown-out well, the casing is believed to have failed under high pressure, allowing the gas to escape."&lt;ref name="ocregister.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ocregister.com/articles/facility-705395-gas-new.html |title=Gas facility that had blowout over Porter Ranch will have to play by new rules |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=February 24, 2016  |website= |publisher=[[Orange County Register]] |access-date=August 1, 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to OSHA's website a blowout is "an uncontrolled flow of gas, oil, or other well fluids" from a well."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/etools/oilandgas/glossary_of_terms/glossary_of_terms_b.html |title=Oil and Gas Well Drilling and Servicing eTool &amp;#124; Glossary of Terms - B |website=Osha.gov |date= |accessdate=2016-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
An article in The Huffington Post entitled "Here’s How Enormous The Methane Blowout Is In California" stated that as of February 1, 2016 the SS-25 well released an estimated 91,000 metric tons of methane gas."The article said that "while this gas blowout has prompted comparisons to BP’s oil well failure in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 and the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska in 1989, experts say this leak will have further-reaching environmental consequences."&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/california-gas-leak-infographic_us_56aff98ce4b09214b14f54b9 |title=Here's How Enormous The Methane Blowout Is In California |publisher=[[Huffington Post]] |date=2016-02-02 |accessdate=2016-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
The source of the leak was a metal pipe in a breached {{convert|7|in|adj=on}} [[casing (borehole)|casing]] of injection well "Standard Sesnon 25" (SS 25) that lies {{convert|8,750|ft}} deep.&lt;ref name=abrams/&gt; SoCal Gas had hypothesized that the leak was no more than {{convert|500|ft}} down in the column used to move gas in and out of the well.&lt;ref name=ud/&gt; Well SS 25 was drilled in 1953 and initially had safety valves, which were removed in 1979 because the valves were old and leaking.&lt;ref name=maddaus/&gt; Because the well was not considered "critical, that is, one within 100 feet of a road or a park, or within 300 feet of a home", the valves were merely removed and not replaced. Multiple safety valves had been removed from the Aliso Canyon/Porter Ranch 1950s-era pipes in 1979, and were never replaced, a fact that was also confirmed by a special investigation into the leak by [[Brad_Sherman|Congressman Brad Sherman]]'s office.&lt;ref name=maddaus/&gt;&lt;ref name=rt&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBYpL3JDCzA  A Staggering Methane Leak Has Caused a State of Emergency in CA] The Big Picture RT January 7, 2016, retrieved January 11, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2016/01/19/rep-brad-sherman-doubtful-porter-ranch-facility-leaking-gas-can-be-reopened/ Article in [[CBS]] 19 January 2016] accessed 31 January 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The atmospheric scientist Steve Conley said the wellhead in Aliso Canyon was 61 years old and he was not "shock[ed] that it failed".&lt;ref name=sacbee&gt;Edward Oritiz [http://www.sacbee.com/news/local/environment/article53629265.html#storylink=cpy UC Davis scientist key to measuring massive methane leak at Aliso Canyon] Sacramento Bee, January 7, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; One reason for the casing failure may have been gas flow not just through the tubing, but also through the casing "in order to meet the demand of a customer", as told by an injection well expert of Texas A&amp;M University interviewed by NPR.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/2016/01/21/463865377/california-examines-safety-of-gas-wells-amid-methane-leak California Examines Safety Of Gas Wells Amid Methane Leak.] NPR All Things Considered, January 21, 2016, retrieved January 22, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 7, 2015, an anonymous video was published that showed a cloud of methane gas hovering over the community of Porter Ranch. The image was captured with an infrared camera, showing the extent of the plume.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title = [NEW - Dec. 11] Aliso Canyon SoCalGas Leak Video|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1Fyevj25-o|date = December 11, 2015|accessdate = January 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emissions==
Natural gas consists largely of methane, an invisible and odorless [[greenhouse gas]] with a [[global warming potential]] 86 times greater than [[carbon dioxide]] in a 20-year time frame, tailing off to about 29 times the effect of carbon dioxide in a 100-year time frame on a mass per mass basis.&lt;ref&gt;Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Summary for policymakers. in: Climate change 2013: The physical science basis. Contribution of Working Group I to the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Technical report, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Cambridge, United Kingdom and New York, NY, USA., 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The leak initially released about 44,000 kilograms(kg) of methane per hour or 1,200 tons of methane every day, which in terms of greenhouse gas output per month compares with the equivalent effluvia from 200,000 cars in a year.&lt;ref name=abrams/&gt; On January 14, 2016, ''Time m''agazine compared the  1.6 million lbs of methane released each day to the emissions of 6 coal fired powerplants, 2.2 million cows per day, or 4.5 million cars.&lt;ref&gt;Justin Worland, Heather Jones.

Steve Conley, an atmospheric scientist at [[UC Davis]] and owner of Scientific Aviation, independently measured the gas emissions.&lt;ref name=sacbee/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wired-Conley"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zhang|first1=Sarah|title=The Lone Pilot Flying Over California’s Giant Methane Leak|url=https://www.wired.com/2016/01/meet-scientist-flying-methane-leak/|website=Wired|accessdate=February 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He sampled the air by flying over the site in his single-engine airplane equipped with an analyzer, which is one of only 3 or 4 of such planes in the country. He said the Aliso Canyon flights were "the hardest [...] I've ever done" because of the headache-inducing smell and sickening turbulence. He doubted the readings initially, and "thought [the instruments] had stopped working because I'd never seen measurement that large before." He had coincidentally been contracted by the [[California Energy Commission]] prior to the gas leak, and said that if he hadn’t been contracted and ready to go, "no one would have known how big [the leak] was."&lt;ref name=sacbee/&gt;

Methane emissions from the Aliso Canyon gas leak were detected by the [[Total Carbon Column Observing Network|TCCON]] site at [[Caltech]] within a day of the start of the leak, but researchers at Caltech did not have an explanation for what was causing something "really weird" over Pasadena until later.&lt;ref name="Fesenmaier"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fesenmaier|first1=Kimm|title=Aliso Canyon, Methane, and Global Climate: A Conversation with Paul Wennberg|url=http://www.scienceandtechnologyresearchnews.com/aliso-canyon-methane-global-climate-conversation-paul-wennberg/|accessdate=12 May 2016|work=Science and Technology Research News|date=April 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; TCCON's monitoring data were used in analyses of the leak to estimate ethane emissions of 7,700 ± 1,700 tonnes using Steve Conley's methane estimate of 97,100 tonnes.&lt;ref name=Wunch2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=Conley2016/&gt;

The community of [[Eight Mile, Alabama]] had a spill of the natural gas [[odorant]] within their community in 2008. Residents continue to experience these symptoms under their long term exposure to mercaptan. The residents say they got very little of the assistance provided to Porter Ranch residents. [[Methanethiol|Methyl mercaptan]] is toxic if inhaled according to its MSDS sheet.&lt;ref name=MSDSmercaptan&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpchem.com/msds/100000013972_SDS_US_EN.PDF | title=Methyl mercaptan MSDS | access-date=March 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is considered fairly harmless by government and industry officials. Whether it is the source of the illnesses in Porter Ranch and Eight Mile has been a subject of debate.&lt;ref name=latimes&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/projects/la-fi-eight-mile-leak/  |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |title=We cannot breathe:' A poor Alabama town has lived with the rotten egg stench of gas for 8 years" |first=Ivan |last=Penn |date=October 15, 2016 |access-date=15 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Closure of well==
By the end of November 2015 SoCal Gas had attempted six [[well kill]] procedures to stop the gas flow by pumping a mixture of mud and brine down the well, the last being on November 25.&lt;ref name=maddaus&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.laweekly.com/news/what-went-wrong-at-porter-ranch-6405804| author=Maddaus G |title=What went wrong at Porter Ranch? |publisher=LA Weekly |date=December 22, 2015| access-date=December 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attempts failed because of ice formation and a high upward pressure averaging 2,700 pounds per square inch.&lt;ref name=CBS&gt;Associated Press [http://www.cbsnews.com/news/huge-california-gas-leak-could-take-months-to-fix/ Huge California gas leak could take months to fix] CBS News, January 2, 2016, retrieved January 11, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 4, 2015 SoCal Gas started drilling a [[relief well]] to the caprock, 8,000 feet down, with the help of [[Boots &amp; Coots]], a subsidiary of Halliburton. The relief well is "similar to the relief well BP’s engineers drilled to stop oil flowing into the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 after the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill|Deepwater Horizon]] disaster".&lt;ref name=ud/&gt; The plan was to pump liquid and cement into the main well once the relief well could vent the gas safely.&lt;ref name=maddaus/&gt;&lt;ref name=sahagun/&gt; SoCal Gas estimated the first relief well would be completed by February 24, 2016.&lt;ref name=sahagun&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-porter-ranch-20151228-story.html |author=Sahagan L |title=SoCal Gas pinpoints the site of a leaking well near Porter Ranch| newspaper=The Los Angeles Times |date=December 27, 2015| accessdate=December 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; SoCal Gas planned to drill a secondary relief well, estimating the leak repair to take up until the end of March 2016.&lt;ref name=sahagun/&gt;

After the seventh effort to plug the leak with slurry starting December 22 had created a 25-feet-deep crater around the wellhead, the danger of a [[Blowout (well drilling)|blow out]] increased. The well needed to be stabilized with tension cables and further attempts to plug the well from above were halted. State regulators became more concerned about the wellhead's stability.&lt;ref name=stjohn&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-aliso-well-hole-20160115-story.html |author=St. John P| title=Efforts to plug Porter Ranch-area gas leak worsened blowout risk, regulators say| newspaper=The Los Angeles Times |date=January 15, 2016 |accessdate=January 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January SoCal Gas sought permission to capture the natural gas and possibly incinerate it, but state regulators voted against it, worried about safety.&lt;ref&gt;Sharon McNary [http://ww2.kqed.org/news/2016/01/20/porter-ranch-gas-leak-to-be-stopped-ahead-of-schedule-utility-says Porter Ranch Gas Leak to Be Stopped Ahead of Schedule, Utility Says] KQED, January 20, 2016, accessdate January 22, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 11, 2016, the relief well intercepted the base of the leaking well and the company began pumping heavy fluids to control the flow of gas out of the leaking well.&lt;ref name=socalgas&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.alisoupdates.com/1443738468372/SoCalGas-Temporarily-Controls-Flow-of-Gas-021116-2.pdf|author=SoCal Gas Press Release|title=SoCal Gas Temporarily Controls Flow of Gas at Leaking Aliso Canyon Well; Initiates Process of Permanently Stopping the Leak|date=February 11, 2016| accessdate=February 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 18, 2016, state officials announced that the leak was permanently plugged.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Criticism==
Steve Conley, the atmospheric scientist that has been measuring the leak's gas emissions, has stated that there was no rapid response plan for this kind of event: "We do not have anything in place to measure giant leaks like this, or to watch them to solve issues." He suggested that contracts needed to be ready so that, "as soon as a leak is spotted you are given a go order and two hours later you're measuring a leak."&lt;ref name=sacbee/&gt;

On January 11, 2016 [[Mitchell Englander]], the Los Angeles City Councilman representing Porter Ranch, criticized SoCal Gas "operating a facility of this magnitude, [...] feeding 20 million addresses" for not having a backup plan, the delay in bringing necessary equipment on site "from the Gulf states like they did in this particular situation" and the delay in catching the brine, oil and chemical mist "landing on people's homes and turning their cars black".&lt;ref name=npr11116&gt;{{cite news|author1=Steve Inskeep, Renee Montagne|title=LA Councilman Compares Porter Ranch Gas Leak To BP Oil Spill But On Land|work=Around the Nation|publisher=NPR|date=January 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Center for Biological Diversity]] has criticized Governor Brown's slow response "because state regulators' hands-off approach to underground injection helped set the stage for this catastrophe." The Center also said, "The state has known for years that aging natural gas infrastructure was a disaster waiting to happen, but officials mostly ignored those risks."&lt;ref&gt;David Siders [http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article53353615.html#storylink=cpy Jerry Brown declares emergency around Southern California gas leak] The Sacramento Bee, January 6, 2016, retrieved January 11, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Experts in [[petroleum engineering]] criticized the delay for not drilling a relief well until six weeks after the leak was known, and for drilling only one relief well instead of two.&lt;ref name=maddaus/&gt;

In January 2016 the [[Associated Press]] reported that SoCal Gas had been under-reporting the levels of benzene in the air surrounding the well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Domonoske|first=Camila|date=January 15, 2016|title=Gas Company Understated Benzene Exposure From California Leak|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/01/15/463178568/gas-company-understated-benzene-exposure-from-california-leak|newspaper=[[NPR]]|access-date=January 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulatory reactions==
Within two days of discovery, "a dozen or more local and state agencies were involved".&lt;ref name =ud/&gt; The [[California Air Resources Board]] measured methane on the ground near the well, from towers, satellites and airplanes, communicating results to the [[California Energy Commission]] and SoCal Gas.&lt;ref name=arb&gt;{{cite web|author1=Mary Nichols|title=Letter to the CEO of SoCalGas|url=http://www.arb.ca.gov/research/reports/arbletter_to_scg_realisocanyon.pdf|publisher=Air Resources Board|accessdate=January 20, 2016|page=5|format=PDF|date=December 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}} The Board asked SoCal Gas 18 very detailed questions about the natural gas, basic leakage rate and leak dynamics.&lt;ref name=arb/&gt;{{rp|4–5}}  The [[Federal Aviation Administration]] established a [[temporary flight restriction]] over the leak site until March 2016. On December 7, 2016 Los Angeles City Attorney Mike Feuer sued SoCal Gas over its handling of the massive well failure. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-gas-leak-porter-ranch-lawsuit-20151207-story.html&lt;/ref&gt;  On December 15, 2015, the [[County of Los Angeles]] declared a state of emergency.&lt;ref name=wilcox&gt;{{cite news| author = Gregory J.

Feuer's Office went to Court again on December 23, 2015 and secured a judicially enforceable agreement with SoCal Gas for the company to speed up relocation efforts of residents affected by the massive leak. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-porter-ranch-judge-20151223-story.html &lt;/ref&gt;

Local residents called upon Governor [[Jerry Brown]] to intercede. [[Kathleen Brown]], his sister, is on the board of [[Sempra Energy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Sempra Energy|url = http://sempra.com/about/governance/board-of-directors.shtml|website = sempra.com|access-date = January 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which owns [[Southern California Gas]]. The Governor visited the site and the neighborhood on January 4, 2016,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caloes.ca.gov/ICESite/Pages/Aliso-Canyon.aspx Alison Canyon Natural Gas Leak] - The California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services (CalOES), State of California&lt;/ref&gt; and declared a state of emergency on January 6, 2016. He issued stepped-up inspections and safety measures for all natural gas storage facilities in California; further injections at Aliso Canyon had already been prohibited.&lt;ref name=barboza/&gt;

Local health officials indicated that long-term exposure to certain trace chemicals could lead to health problems.&lt;ref name=abrams/&gt;

In January 2016 two California senators asked the heads of the [[US Department of Justice]] and [[US Department of Transportation]] and the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] for a "legal analysis of any federal authorities that could apply to this incident and storage fields in general" and a "technical analysis of whether Southern California Gas Company could more quickly reduce the gas stored in the facility."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Devin Henry|title=Dems seek feds' help in California methane leak|url=http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/265748-calif-dems-ask-feds-to-get-involved-in-methane-leak|accessdate=January 20, 2016|work=The Hill|publisher=Capitol Hill Publishing Corp.,|date=January 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On January 11, four California State senators introduced bills to enact an immediate moratorium on any new injections of natural gas and the use of vintage wells (SB 875), to ensure that SoCal Gas will pay housing, relocation and emergency response costs and prohibit the [[California Public Utilities Commission]] (CPUC) from allocating those costs to ratepayers, and that it will pay the costs to mitigate the greenhouse gas emissions from its utility profits (SB 876).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Who Pays to Fix the Aliso Canyon Methane Leak?|date= January 26, 2016|first=Vidhya |last=Prabhakaran |publisher= Davis Wright Tremaine LLP| work=Energy &amp; Environmental Law Blog|url=http://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/who-pays-to-fix-the-aliso-canyon-81190/|access-date = January 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; SB 887 would require all 14 underground natural gas storage facilities to be inspected within the next 12 months and at least annually thereafter; it would also require enhanced safety standards such as the installation of subsurface safety valves, using new leak-detection technology and development of rigorous response plans.&lt;ref&gt;Fran Pavley.

==Political reaction==
On March 31, 2016 The [[New York Times]] published a magazine feature article about the leak called "The Invisible Catastrophe," noting that in an election year a "menacing disaster that causes mass vomiting and mass nosebleeds in a wealthy, vote-rich community ...is a candidate’s dream." While crediting Governor Jerry Brown as the "only politician who has failed to use the gas leak for political gain," it noted freshman Congressman Steve Knight's acceptance of campaign contributions from SoCalGas' parent company Sempra Energy, and his continued defense of the company into December when he said they were "working on this as diligently as they can." While Knight later called for congressional hearings on the matter, one of his opponents, Democrat [[Bryan Caforio]], quickly seized on the environmental disaster as a central issue of the 25th Congressional race, which according to the Times article "promises to be one of few closely contested races in the House." &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/03/magazine/the-invisible-catastrophe.html The Invisible Catastrophe] [[The New York Times Magazine]], March 31, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Los Angeles Times'' wrote that no politician is "pursuing the issue as hard as Caforio," who on  January 6, 2016, spoke to a group of disgruntled Porter Ranch residents who attended a meeting co-hosted by environmental activist [[Erin Brockovich]]. Caforio "aggressively attacked" his opponent, [[Steve Knight (politician)|Steve Knight]], for his delayed response to the leak.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-0118-porter-ranch-pols-20160118-story.html Porter Ranch gas leak lingers] Los Angeles Times, Jan. 18, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationaljournal.com/s/352854/caforino-chastises-knight-over-porter-ranch-gas-leak Caforio Chastises Knight Over Porter Ranch Gas Leak: Caforio spoke to the area before Knight] National Journal, Jan. 19, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; While Knight states he does not want to politicize the disaster, fellow Republican Michael Antonovich, a Los Angeles County supervisor who has voted consistently against regulation efforts, has been outspoken about his determination to hold SoCalGas responsible.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/03/magazine/the-invisible-catastrophe.html The Invisible Catastrophe] The New York Times Magazine, March 31, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==

Elected officials, including [[Brad_Sherman|Congressman Brad Sherman]] and [[Henry_Stern_(politician)|Senator Henry Stern]], took the position that no decision about whether to reactivate the facility until the health study and an ongoing search for the leak’s cause are complete.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailynews.com/opinion/20170124/in-socalgas-leak-dispute-a-chance-to-meet-in-the-middle Article in [[Los Angeles Daily News]] 24 January 2017] accessed 31 January 2017&lt;/ref&gt; [[SoCalGas]] had been repeatedly asking California regulators for permission to resume pumping pressurized natural gas into the ground in Porter Ranch, northeast of Los Angeles, at the depleted oil field, which has continued to be used for storage. Records show the utility has been negotiating this step with regulators for several weeks. Since the multiple investigations into the cause of the leak have not been completed, [[Brad_Sherman|Congressman Brad Sherman]] insisted that the process of reopening the storage facility must proceed with extreme caution. Aliso Canyon is not deemed ready to resume normal operations by regulators or chief politicians that are involved with the oversight of the securing and cleanup of the leak. [[Brad_Sherman|Congressman Brad Sherman]] urged that the gas company be restricted to minimal operations required to prevent power interruptions. The storage field is a primary supplier to gas-powered electric plants. The gas leak has been cited by experts and independent researchers as the largest in U.S. History.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-porter-ranch-20161101-story.html Article in [[Los Angeles Times]] 1 November 2016] accessed 31 January 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecowatch.com/porter-ranch-monster-gas-leak-largest-in-u-s-history-1882181666.html Article in EcoWatch.com 27 February 2016] accessed 31 January 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal consequences==
On November 23, 2015, some residents who had been displaced by the leaking gases filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior Court to require that SoCal Gas to disclose information related to the health risks of the gases released. The plaintiffs also had continued to seek damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-porter-ranch-lawsuit-20151202-story.html | title = Class-action lawsuit filed over Porter Ranch gas leak | newspaper = The Los Angeles Times | access-date = February 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.porterranchlawsuit.com/ | title = Porter Ranch SoCalGas Well Blowout Lawsuits | website = Porter Ranch SoCal Gas Leak Lawsuits Center | access-date = February 26, 2016

On September 13, 2016, ''The Los Angeles Times'' reported that [[SoCalGas]] reached a plea agreement with the Los Angeles County prosecutor's office.  Under the agreement, [[SoCalGas]] plead no contest to one misdemeanor count of failing to immediately report the October 2015 leak and was ordered to pay a $4 million fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-porter-ranch-settlement-20160913-snap-story.html|title=SoCal Gas to pay $4-million settlement over massive Porter Ranch gas leak|last=Times|first=Los Angeles|website=latimes.com|access-date=2016-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The resulting settlement between the local Los Angeles prosecutor's office and [[SoCalGas]] executives had ended in a mere misdemeanor charge, the lowest possible charge, which can be [[Expungement|expunged]]. In addition to the negotiated plea deal, SoCalGas had paid a penalty fine of a relatively small $4 million U.S. dollars. $4 million USD is the equivalent of the amount of revenue that [[SoCalGas]] received in profits in less than most average 12 hour time periods during the [[fiscal year]] of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WElmdWzJTzQ |title=Porter Ranch gas leak settlement angers residents  |work=[[RT_America]] |accessdate=January 30, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Porter Ranch Gas Leak has been cited often by experts and independent tests as the largest gas leak in U.S. History.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecowatch.com/porter-ranch-monster-gas-leak-largest-in-u-s-history-1882181666.html Article in EcoWatch.com 27 February 2016] accessed 31 January 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Angra Nuclear Power Plant''' is Brazil's only nuclear power plant. It is located at the '''Central Nuclear Almirante Álvaro Alberto''' ('''CNAAA''') on the Itaorna Beach in [[Angra dos Reis]], [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]]. It consists of two [[Pressurized water reactor]]s, '''Angra I''', with a net output of 609 [[MWe#Electrical and thermal watts|MWe]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eletronuclear.gov.br/AEmpresa/CentralNuclear/Informa%C3%A7%C3%B5esAngra1.aspx Eletronuclear - Informações Angra 1]&lt;/ref&gt; first connected to the power grid in 1985&lt;ref name=IAEAreport&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iaea.org/inis/collection/NCLCollectionStore/_Public/33/029/33029574.pdf|publisher=IAEA|title=Second National Report of Brazil, Nuclear Installations|accessdate=2015-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and '''Angra II''', with a net output of 1,275 MWe,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eletronuclear.gov.br/AEmpresa/CentralNuclear/Informa%C3%A7%C3%B5esAngra2.aspx  Informações Angra 2]&lt;/ref&gt; connected in 2000.

Work started again on 1 June 2010 for entry into service in 2015 and later delayed to 2018.&lt;ref name="IAEA"&gt;[http://www.iaea.org/programmes/a2/ Power Reactor Information System] of the [[International Atomic Energy Agency|IAEA]]: [http://www.iaea.org/cgi-bin/db.page.pl/pris.powrea.htm?country=BR&amp;sort=&amp;sortlong=Alphabetic "Brazil, Federative Republic of : Nuclear Power Reactors"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eletronuclear"&gt;[http://www.eletronuclear.gov.br/Not%C3%ADcias/NoticiaDetalhes.aspx?NoticiaID=1446 "Eletronuclear - Obras civis de Angra 3 voltarão ao ritmo normal"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Existing complex==
The '''Central Nuclear Almirante Álvaro Alberto''' complex is administrated by [[Eletronuclear]], a state company with the [[monopoly]] in nuclear power generation in Brazil. The complex employs some 3,000 people and generates another 10,000 indirect jobs in [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro state]].

Angra I was purchased from [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation (1886)|Westinghouse]] of the [[United States|USA]] (its sister power plant is [[Krško Nuclear Power Plant]] in Slovenia&lt;ref&gt;http://entrac.iaea.org/I-and-C/TM_PRAGUE_2007_05/CD/Papers/Furieri_paper.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;). The [[balance of plant]] design was subcontracted to Gibbs and Hill (USA) in association with PROMON Engenharia S.A. and construction to Brasileira de Engenharia S.A.&lt;ref name=IAEAreport/&gt; 

The purchase did not include the transfer of sensitive reactor technology. As a result, Angra II was built with German technology, as part of a comprehensive nuclear agreement between Brazil and [[West Germany]] signed by President [[Ernesto Geisel]] in 1975. The complex was designed to have three [[Pressurized water reactor|PWR]] units with a total output of around 3,000 MWe and was to be the first of 4 nuclear plants that would be built up to 1990.

==Reactors==
The plant has two [[pressurized water reactor]]s, with a total net capacity of {{nowrap|1,884 MW&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Its units are rated as follows:
* Angra 1:  640 MW&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;
* Angra 2: 1275 MW&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;

==Future developments==
[[File:Construction site Angra III.JPG|thumb|260px|Construction site Angra III in May 2015]]
The development of Angra III began in 1984 as a Siemens/KWU [[pressurized water reactor]] but was halted in 1986. About 70% of the plant's equipment was purchased in 1985 but has been in storage ever since. In June 2007, restarting of work on was approved by the [[National Council for Energy Policy]]. President [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]] greenlit the project in July 2007. On December 2008, Eletronuclear signed an industrial cooperation agreement with [[Areva]]. On 31 May 2010, the [[National Nuclear Energy Commission]] granted a licence for construction of the third reactor. Construction of the reactor, which has a capacity of 1,350&amp;nbsp;MWe, begun on 1 June 2010 and was predicted to be operational by 2018.&lt;ref name="IAEA"/&gt;&lt;ref name=wnn020610&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

After stopping construction in 2014, the Brazilian government have decided to auction off the incomplete power station to private investors in 2018. Based on that timetable and the volume of construction works to complete, the Energy deputy minister expects completion to be achieved by 2023.

'''Azura''' is a [[wave power]] device currently being tested in [[Hawaii]].&lt;ref name="energy.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.energy.gov/eere/articles/innovative-wave-power-device-starts-producing-clean-power-hawaii|title=Innovative Wave Power Device Starts Producing Clean Power in Hawaii|work=Energy.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://subseaworldnews.com/2015/06/12/nwei-deploys-azura-wave-energy-device-in-hawaii/|title=NWEI Deploys Azura Wave Energy Device in Hawai’i|work=Subsea World News}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is connected to the municipal [[power grid|grid]] providing electricity to Hawaii. According to the [[United States Department of Energy]], this is the first time that a wave power generator has been officially verified to be supplying energy to a power grid in North America. This has been verified by the [[University of Hawaii]].&lt;ref name="renews.biz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://renews.biz/89902/azura-connects-in-hawaii/|title=Azura connects in Hawaii|work=reNEWS - Renewable Energy News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stevedent"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2015/07/07/wave-generator-hawaii-power-grid/|title=Wave generator supplies US electrical grid for the first time|author=Steve Dent|publisher=AOL|work=Engadget}}&lt;/ref&gt; The device can generate 20 [[kilowatt]]s of power.&lt;ref name="energy.gov"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gizmag.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gizmag.com/azura-wave-energy-system-hawaii/38371/|title=Azura wave energy system deployed in Hawaii|work=gizmag.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The device is at the [[Marine Corps Base Hawaii]]'s Wave Energy Test Site (WETS) on the north shore of [[Kaneohe Bay]], Oahu. It is situated on the surface of a 30-meter-deep [[Berth (moorings)|berth]] where it is being monitored.&lt;ref name="stevedent"/&gt;

This prototype (TRL 5/6) was developed by Northwest Energy Innovations (NWEI) with the support of the [[U.S. Navy]], the United States Department of Energy, and the University of Hawaii. It will be in operation for a 1-year period of assessment.&lt;ref name="energy.gov"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gizmag.com"/&gt; During that time, the University of Hawaii will be responsible for the collection and analysis of data.&lt;ref name="gizmag.com"/&gt;

Azura was originally named "'''WET-NZ'''" from "Wave Energy Technology-New Zealand".

==Description and operation==
Azura floats on the surface of the sea and weighs 45 tons (41 tonnes). It has a unique floating mechanism that can rotate 360 degrees. This enables it to extract power from [[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)#Six degrees of freedom|horizontal (surge) as well as vertical (heave)]] wave motion.&lt;ref name="gizmag.com"/&gt; It has reserve buoyancy that is very low, allowing it to partially submerge beneath large waves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.renewableenergymagazine.com/article/azura-wave-energy-device-deployed-at-us-20150618/|title=Ocean Energy - Azura wave energy device deployed at US Navy test site - Renewable Energy Magazine, at the heart of clean energy journalism|work=renewableenergymagazine.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Wave float with piston rod.gif|thumbnail|[[Wave power#Point absorber buoy|Point absorber]]]]
Azura is a [[Wave power#Point absorber buoy|point absorber]]. This means that it uses a floating surface mechanism to absorb the energy of waves from different directions. This is the most common type of deepwater wave energy generator.&lt;ref name="breakingenergy.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://breakingenergy.com/2014/11/05/wave-energy-developers-line-up-for-hawaii-test-site/|title=Wave Energy Developers Line Up for Hawaii Test Site|work=Breaking Energy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The generator is driven with a high-pressure hydraulics system.&lt;ref name="breakingenergy.com"/&gt;

==Preliminary tests==
The initial phase of development used a smaller prototype that was tested in a [[wave tank]].

A second prototype was then installed in 2012 for a 6-week period at the [[Northwest National Marine Renewable Energy Center]]’s test site off the coast of [[Oregon]] in an open-sea area. During that test, the device was exposed to wave heights of up to 3.75-meters in a 12 to 14-second [[sea state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://azurawave.com/projects/oregon/|title=Oregon Pilot Project|work=azurawave.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both tests were successful.&lt;ref name="energy.gov"/&gt;

==Future plans==
NWEI will use information gathered during the current test to further develop the project. With the Department of Energy providing an additional 5 million dollars, NWEI plans to modify Azura to increase its efficiency and improve reliability. A new design will then be tested which will be full-scale and made to generate between 500 kilowatts and one [[megawatt]] of power.&lt;ref name="energy.gov"/&gt;

At the end of 2017, Northwest Energy Innovations (NWEI) intends to install a full-scale model. The 500-kilowatt to 1-megawatt generator will be situated in a 60 to 80-meter-deep (100–150 feet) berth. One megawatt is sufficient to provide electricity to several hundred homes.&lt;ref name="renews.biz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="stevedent"/&gt;

'''Bass Point Reserve''' is a heritage-listed former cedar timber industry, [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] camping, meeting place, pastoral property and [[basalt]] mine and now [[conservation (ethic)|nature conservation]] and passive recreation area located at Boollwarroo Parade, [[Shell Cove, New South Wales|Shell Cove]] in the [[City of Shellharbour]] local government area of [[New South Wales]], Australia. It is also known as '''Long Point'''. The property is owned by [[Department of the Environment (Australia)|Department of the Environment]] and [[City of Shellharbour|Shellharbour City Council]]. It was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 18 January 2013.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1896&gt;{{cite NSW SHR|5061535|Bass Point Reserve|hr=01896|fn=12/03599|accessdate=2 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
===Indigenous history===
Archaeological evidence indicates that Aboriginal people occupied the [[Illawarra]] region for some 20,000 years prior to the arrival of European settlers. The Elouera people are traditional custodians of the land extending from [[Stanwell Park, New South Wales|Stanwell Park]] in the north, [[Shoalhaven River]] in the south, west to [[Picton, New South Wales|Picton]] and [[Moss Vale, New South Wales|Moss Vale]], and east to the ocean. The Elouera people are a group, subdivided from the larger [[Tharawal|Dharawal]] group, that occupies the land from [[Botany Bay]] to [[Jervis Bay]].&lt;ref name=nswshr-1896/&gt;

In the Illawarra region, the Elouera were identified as fresh or salt water people due to their occupation of particular marine or estuarine landscapes and their use of the natural resources found in these environments. Essentially, the Elouera people lived a hunter/gatherer lifestyle, governed by the sustainable use of their surrounding environment and the available resources. Traditionally, the division of labour in such a society was determined by gender and age - men hunted by land and sea while women gathered food and resources. The Aboriginal people had developed their understanding of the region and environmental sustainability over thousands of years and there is archaeological evidence to suggest that the people travelled the land making use of seasonal resources when they were abundantly available and allowing those depleted to regenerate with time.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1896/&gt;

The diet of the Elouera people was varied and flexible - consisting of (among other things) fish, shellfish and seals from the ocean; and wallabies, possums, birds and plants from the land. Evidence of this changing diet has been found through archaeological investigation of the shell middens at both [[Bass Point (Australia)|Bass Point]] and along the NSW coastline.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1896/&gt;

These shell middens are found in coastal environments throughout Australia - but particularly on the east coast. Those identified at Bass Point have been dated at 6000 years old, from the period when the sea levels stabilised and the coastal environment developed into what it is today. Analysis of the content of these middens has revealed shell and food remains that indicate the hunter/gatherer lifestyle of the traditional Aboriginal people in the Illawarra region. Excavation of shell middens at Bass Point have also revealed the changing tools and technology used by the Elouera people to exploit the available resources around them - in particular, the development and evolution of hunting practices as species of fish and animals changed with the seasons and over the years.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1896/&gt;

Middens are usually found in close proximity to both fresh water supplies and have often resulted from an established occupation of a place. Evidence at Bass Point indicates the longevity of its use by the Aboriginal people as an important camping and meeting place - a value supported by the oral tradition of the local people. The coastal plain is known to have been an abundant natural environment of food and fresh water resources and, with their in-depth understanding of the marine environment, Bass Point must have been regarded by the Aboriginal people as a resourceful place that could sustain long-term occupation.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1896/&gt;

===Early European history===
A harmonious and balanced relationship between the Aboriginal people and the environment existed for thousands of years and it was in this form when the Aboriginal people first had contact with European explorers. Although there may have been earlier contact with Portuguese, Spanish, Polynesian or Asian explorers, the first report of Bass Point and the local Aboriginal people comes from Captain [[James Cook]] who sailed by the region on the ''Endeavour'' in April 1770. Those on board noted in their journals of their observations - "Sunday, 22nd April:....and were so near the shore as to distinguish several people upon the Sea Beach. They appeared to be of a very dark Colour....Thursday, 26th April: Saw several smokes along shore after dark, and 2 or 3 times a fire".&lt;ref&gt;Organ, "A Documentary History of the Illawarra and South Coast Aborigines", p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; The journals from the Endeavour also make note of the "numerous campfires, on the blackness of the natives, and of a luxuriant vegetation and varied landscape".&lt;ref name=nswshr-1896-4960&gt;Organ &amp; Speechley, "Illawarra Aborigines", p.8&lt;/ref&gt; There are historical reports that Cook attempted to make a landing along the Illawarra coastline but abandoned these efforts due to uncertain and dangerous conditions. Had this landing been successful, it would have been the first on Australian soil - predating that at Botany Bay. Although the lives of the Aboriginal people continued relatively undisturbed following this visit, stories soon circulated between the groups about sightings of the "White Swan" (believed to be a reference to the sails of the Endeavour).&lt;ref name=nswshr-1896/&gt;

The geographic nature of the Illawarra ensured that the region remained isolated from the early colonial settlement following the [[First Fleet]] landing in 1788. The surrounding mountains provided a barrier to the north and west and, with the absence of a natural and accessible harbour, official settlement of the region did not occur until early in the nineteenth century. Stories of the arrival of Europeans surely spread to the region through communication between Aboriginal groups quickly and, as in other parts of Australia, it was first thought by the Aboriginal people that the settlers were their reborn ancestors. Their pale skin but similar features ensured inquisitive but mostly civil early interactions between the settlers and the Elouera people.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1896/&gt;

===Early Colonial exploration of the Illawarra region===
The first official exploration of the Illawarra region (then known as the 'Five Islands District') was recorded by [[George Bass]] and [[Matthew Flinders]] in 1796. Following a similar exploratory expedition up the [[Georges River]], Bass and Flinders ventured to the Illawarra region to explore and examine the country, take specimens from the environment and to report their findings back to the colony with recommendations for possible future settlements. The local Aboriginal people may have had sporadic interactions with other Europeans after the Bass/Flinders visit (including the shipwreck survivors of the [[Sydney Cove]] in 1797 who were making the arduous and largely fatal trek from [[Cape Howe]] to [[Sydney]]) but little changed as a result of the First Fleet landing until the region was officially settled in 1803 - the effect of this settlement on the local Aboriginal people being felt almost immediately.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1896/&gt;

The colonial settlement in Sydney experienced a severe drought in 1803 that threatened the agricultural industries (particularly cattle grazing) that supported life in the colony. Finding fresh new pastures was essential to the survival of the industry and reports of the rich untouched land further south at [[Lake Illawarra]] soon circulated amongst the colonists. Free grazing rights were issued by the government - and a significant land parcel stretching from Lake Illawarra to the [[Minnamurra River]] (and incorporating Bass Point) was granted to free settler, James Badgery, for cattle running.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1896/&gt;

At this time, Red Cedar-cutting was also an important industry in the colony and there were lucrative supplies discovered in the virgin bush of the Illawarra region.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1896/&gt;

Both the cattlemen and the cedar-cutters were adventurous and were the first Europeans to traverse the unknown country - successfully doing so by following the traditional trails established by the Aboriginal people. From even this early period of settlement, European exploitation of the land and resources had begun. The easy abuse of land through clearing of vegetation and wildlife would have been an abhorrent disrespect to the Aboriginal people. The traditional lifestyle of the people had been sustained by this land and its immediate exploitation by the European settlers would no doubt have led to future conflicts.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1896/&gt;

===Colonial settlement and development of industry===
In 1816, in an effort to regulate land ownership in an official system, [[Lachlan Macquarie|Governor Lachlan Macquarie]] called for the division of the region (what is now Shellharbour Municipality) into land grants - 22 in total. The free grants were given to prominent colonial citizens and cattlemen - one such grant of 1650 acres, and later an additional 2000 acres (including Bass Point), was granted to [[D'Arcy Wentworth]], a wealthy colonial official and medical practitioner.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1896/&gt;

Although Wentworth was promised the land grants in 1817, he was not issued with the land until 1821 when he established "Peterborough Estate". Following the exit of Badgery, Wentworth was able to run his own cattle while, at the same time, acquiring surrounding grants to expand his land holding. There is a strong presumption that the expansion of Peterborough Estate was organised with the other land-holders from very early on. The land was rich in pasture and possibility but remained largely unsettled and unused by its early owners. By 1827, Wentworth had acquired the largest land holding in the region totalling 13,050 acres - including Bass Point and the private Peterborough township (that is now Shellharbour village).&lt;ref name=nswshr-1896/&gt;

The repossession and division of the richest lands in the region had a devastating effect on the Elouera people. The prime locations selected for land grants would have been those with easy accessibility to fresh water supplies - the areas most valued by the Aboriginal people for resources and as traditional camping places. Larger numbers of people occupying the land also reduced the capacity for the Aboriginal people to traverse the region as they had traditionally done.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1896/&gt;

Colonial grazing and farming of the land also had a detrimental and lasting effect on the native food supplies used by the Aboriginal people. Traditional plants had been destroyed by grazing cattle and replaced by introduced plant species.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1896/&gt;

Additionally, native animal species had been frightened away from their habitats. In no time, the scarcity of traditional resources saw a crisis arise in the lifestyle of the local Aboriginal people - their homeland was being ravaged and their very survival was at risk.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1896/&gt;

The rapid degradation of the sustainable environment left the traditional Aboriginal people with one option: appropriate the introduced crops and stock to survive. While traditional Aboriginal life had no concept of ownership (but rather a shared use of land and resources), the settlers viewed their actions as theft and crimes punishable by violent retaliation. At this point in relations, the Aboriginal people were struggling to maintain their traditional ways of life while contending with the force of the colonial settlers and it was soon realised that the Elouera people had little to match the sheer number of settlers with their introduced firearms and diseases (smallpox, influenza and tuberculosis).&lt;ref name=nswshr-1896/&gt;

The colonial government, under Governor Macquarie's direction, had declared unofficial war against the Aboriginal people. A detachment of the 46th Regiment was sent to Red Point (now Hill 60 at [[Port Kembla, New South Wales|Port Kembla]]) to bring a show of force to the Aboriginal people. "During April of 1816 Macquarie instructed his soldiers to seek out the Aborigines and "strike them with terror .... drive them to a distance from the settlements of the White Men ... inflict terrible and exemplary punishments" so as the [[Government of New South Wales|NSW Government]] would not be seen to show cowardice in the face of perceived Aboriginal aggression".&lt;ref name=nswshr-1896-4961&gt;Organ &amp; Speechley, "Illawarra Aborigines", p.10&lt;/ref&gt; It was the colonial intention that fear be instilled in the local Aboriginal people to reduce retaliation attempts on the settlement.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1896/&gt;

As a result of this action, the traditional Aboriginal population was quickly decimated. With forced removal to fringe camps, assimilation to European culture and the imposition of strict control measures - coupled with their delegation to the bottom of the social hierarchy - the Aboriginal people had no recourse against the invasion of the settlers throughout the nineteenth century. Governor Macquarie's plans to expand the colonial frontier had been a success and the rich land of the Illawarra region had been cleared of its traditional inhabitants and was free to be exploited by the settlers.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1896/&gt;

By the 1840s, the colony was experiencing an economic depression and the large landholdings in the region were soon subdivided into smaller tenant farms. Provided rent-free for periods of up to six years, the land was leased to families for the purpose of clearing native vegetation and cultivating crops. Wheat and maize were popular early crops but soon proved to be susceptible to rust and ultimately financially unprofitable for the farmers. By the second half of the nineteenth century however, the dairy industry had been established and was proving to be a successful business for the small landholders in the region.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1896/&gt;

During this period, {{convert|2560|acre|ha|order=flip}} of Peterborough Estate (including Bass Point) had been sold by the Wentworth family to George Laurence Fuller who named the property "Dunmore Estate". By 1880, Fuller had negotiated a mining venture and established a basalt "blue gold" quarry to the south of Bass Point including the construction of a new {{convert|480|ft|m|adj=on|order=flip}} jetty to ship the quarried metal. Although the enterprise collapsed within two years, Fuller resumed operations as the proprietor and manager and, by 1890, business was booming. To support the industry, Fuller soon improved and extended the jetty to {{convert|500|ft|m|order=flip}} and commissioned the construction of the SS ''Dunmore'' to transport the crushed basalt from Bass Point to the markets of Sydney.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1896/&gt;

===Shipping trade at Bass Point===
Shipping was the favoured mode of transport of the product but the journey was often a hazardous one with a number of ships lost along the coast and in the waters surrounding Bass Point. The ''Bertha'', an {{convert|87|ST|t|adj=on|order=flip}} wooden schooner, is thought to be one of the earliest wrecks from the basalt trade. It was reported that she was transporting bluestone from [[Kiama, New South Wales|Kiama]] to Sydney and, on 9 September 1879, ran ashore on the north side of Bass Point and broke apart. It was reported in the media at the time that the local Aboriginal people camped at Bass Point had assisted with the rescue of the three crewmen and two passengers on board by conveying a line from the stricken vessel to the shore.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1896/&gt;

Over the years, other ships experienced a similar fate to that of the ''Bertha'': in 1880, the wooden paddle steamer ''Our Own'' was wrecked off the beach at Bass Point with the loss of two lives; the ''Alexander Berry'', a wooden steamer, went down in 1901 with four of the five crewmen perishing in the accident; the ''Comboyne'' wrecked in 1920; and the ''Kiltobranks'', another blue metal carrier, in 1924.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1896/&gt;

One of the more well-known shipwrecks of Bass Point was the loss of the ''Cities Service Boston'' on 16 May 1943. The US oil tanker was transporting fuel supplies from the Middle East before running aground during a storm at what is now known as Boston Point. Australian soldiers from the 6th Australian Machine Gun Battalion were camped nearby and assisted in the rescue of the 62 crew on board. All lives from the Boston were saved but four Australian soldiers perished in the rescue. To commemorate the loss, plaques were unveiled at Bass Point in 1968 and a remembrance service is held at the site each year.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1896/&gt;

Since Dunmore Estate was sold in the 1920s, the land in and around Bass Point was used by the Australian Military Forces for defensive, training and surveillance functions. By {{circa|1957}}, Bass Point was purchased by [[Imperial Chemical Industries]] (ICI) and mining of its extensive basalt deposits was renewed. The original jetty had deteriorated beyond the needs of the mining leases and was ultimately demolished in 1958 before being replaced by a new jetty directly east of the original.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1896/&gt;

===Conservation as a nature reserve===
It was as a result of the increased mining of Bass Point in the 1960s, that its future as a natural reserve was first considered. Local conservationists had formed a society to promote the natural value of Bass Point and to balance the interests of both conservation and development. A reserve was officially declared in 1968 and, furthermore, Bushrangers Bay Marine Reserve was declared in 1982.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1896/&gt;

===Archaeological discoveries===
Since the historic value of Bass Point has been recognised, there have been archaeological investigations of the area that have revealed significant information about its pre-contact history. Of the 12 shell midden sites identified on Bass Point, Dr Sandra Bowdler investigated six sites in 1970 as the basis for her thesis. Further analysis of the remaining six sites was undertaken by Dr PJ Hughes in 1974.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1896/&gt;

Middens of the NSW South Coast, including those at Bass Point, contain indicative remains of the food sources of the Aboriginal people. Upon analysis of the middens at Bass Point, Dr Bowdler and Dr Hughes discovered shells and bones of shellfish, fish, wallabies, bandicoots, possums, birds and seals.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1896/&gt;

It was also considered that the many middens along the northern shoreline may, in fact, represent a single continuous midden site.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1896/&gt;

These archaeological excavations revealed the environmental change and evolution of Bass Point over time and, further analysis of the midden sites has shown the development of techniques used by the Aboriginal people to hunt and gather available resources. As a result of these archaeological assessments, Bass Point is now considered to be one of the most significant Aboriginal archaeological sites to be excavated in NSW.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1896/&gt;

== Description ==
Located {{convert|25|km}} south of Wollongong, Bass Point Reserve is a 4&amp;nbsp;km-long natural promontory of rocky shorelines and sandy embayments that supports a diverse collection of natural and cultural elements.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1896/&gt;

As a cultural landscape, Bass Point Reserve includes sites of Aboriginal archaeological significance and others of European historical significance. Fourteen sites associated with the sustained Aboriginal occupation of the land have been identified - 13 of which are coastal shell middens and one meeting and camping place. Sites of European occupation include potential remnants of the original jetty (to the west of the existing jetty) and, on Boston Point, a memorial to the 1943 shipwreck of the Cities Service Boston and the four lives lost during the rescue operation.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1896/&gt;

In the waters surrounding Bass Point Reserve, six shipwrecks have been identified and the associated artefact scatter recorded. These wrecks include ''Bertha'' (1879), ''Our Own'' (1880), ''Alexander Berry'' (1901), ''Comboyne'' (1920), ''Kiltobranks'' (1924) and the ''Cities Service Boston'' (1943).&lt;ref name=nswshr-1896/&gt;

The Bass Point Marine Area surrounding the reserve is regarded as highly significant for its biodiversity and pristine condition. This relatively undisturbed environment supports a variety of common, rare and endangered fauna and flora species. The shallow and sheltered waters have seen the development of a significant but fragile Sea Grass Habitat that provides a suitable environment for many aquatic animals to shelter, feed and breed.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1896/&gt;

Bass Point Marine Area is also classified as critical habitat for the Grey Nurse Shark - an endangered species under NSW law.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1896/&gt;

To the eastern point of Bass Point Reserve is Bushrangers Bay Aquatic Reserve. Made up of beaches, intertidal rock pools, seagrasses and submarine cliffs the reserve provides important habitats for a variety of animals including fish, anemones, sponges, crabs, molluscs and urchins.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1896/&gt;

Bass Point Reserve also supports diverse headland vegetation and significant littoral rainforest - making it one of the most important and unique natural landscapes in southern NSW. Littoral rainforest is generally a closed forest with its structure and composition strongly influenced by its close proximity to the marine environment. Positioned on coastal headlands or beach sand dunes, littoral rainforest is considered an Endangered Ecological Community in NSW. The natural vegetation of Bass Point Reserve supports a variety of flora and fauna, both common and rare to the region.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1896/&gt;

Today, the spectacular visual interplay of the bush vegetation, beaches, headlands, cliffs, ocean and sky makes Bass Point Reserve a scenic location for recreation visitors.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1896/&gt;

=== Condition ===

The natural environment of Bass Point Reserve has undergone periods of regeneration by Shellharbour Council's rangers and is in good condition. The ongoing maintenance of visitor areas has also ensured the good condition of facilities.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1896/&gt;

Since the Bass Point Marine Area was identified, and specific areas classified as critical habitats and aquatic reserves, the marine environment surrounding Bass Point Reserve has remained in pristine condition.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1896/&gt;

Although Bass Point Reserve has been subject to earlier archaeological investigations (in 1969/70 by Dr Sandra Bowdler and again in 1974 by Hughes &amp; Sullivan), there is great potential for further archaeological discoveries - both terrestrial and maritime.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1896/&gt;

Through Dr Bowdler's investigation, she concluded that there is potential that the individual shell midden sites on the northern shoreline could represent one single continuous midden site. It is also highly probable that there may be unrecorded Aboriginal artefact scatters and burial sites on the reserve (either individually or in association with midden sites).&lt;ref name=nswshr-1896/&gt;

In regard to shipwrecks, the location of the Bertha remains undiscovered and it is also possible that there are further shipwrecks that have gone unrecorded in present documentation.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1896/&gt;

Bass Point Reserve is an evolving and naturally changing landscape but its designation as a nature reserve has ensured that the site will remain a natural environment into the future while maintaining its use for recreational purposes.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1896/&gt;

=== Modifications and dates ===
Since pre-European contact, with archaeological evidence indicating sustained occupation of Bass Point by Aboriginal people (some 20,000 years), the following modifications have been made:&lt;ref name=nswshr-1896/&gt;
*1803 - grazing and clearing rights secured by free settler, James Badgery, for land (including Bass Point)
*1880 - George Laurence Fuller (proprietor and business manager) commences basalt mining on Bass Point
*1885 - Fuller builds {{convert|480|ft|m|order=flip|adj=on}} jetty for shipping of blue metal from Bass Point quarry to Sydney
*{{circa|1890}} - Fuller improves and extends jetty to {{convert|500|ft|m|order=flip}}
*1939-53 - Bass Point used by Australian Military Forces for various defensive, training and surveillance functions
*{{circa|1958}} - demolition of jetty and construction of modern replacement (sited directly to the east)
*1968 - construction and unveiling of memorial to ''Cities Service Boston'' shipwreck and the four lives lost during the rescue operation
*1968 - Bass Point given to Shellharbour Council for future use as natural reserve
*Post-1968 - minor development (building and maintaining roads; parking sites; amenities; and public facilities)

== Heritage listing ==
As at 28 March 2012, Bass Point Reserve is of state heritage significance for both its Aboriginal and European values; its pre- and post-contact history; and its natural and maritime heritage.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1896/&gt;

Archaeological evidence indicates that Aboriginal people have occupied the Illawarra region and Bass Point Reserve for some 20,000 years prior to the arrival of European settlers. The traditional custodians of the land, the Elouera people lived in a hunter/gatherer lifestyle, governed by the sustainable use of the environment and the resources available. Bass Point was a place of established occupation for the Aboriginal people and is regarded as a traditionally important camping and meeting place.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1896/&gt;

Bass Point has been the focus of attention from archaeologists since the late 1960s as an area that has potential to reveal significant information about pre-contact history in NSW. Twelve midden sites and one camping/meeting place have been identified and archaeological excavations have revealed the environmental change and evolution of the area over time and the development of techniques used by the Aboriginal people to hunt and gather available resources.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1896/&gt;

Alongside [[Burrill Lake]] rock shelter (which is of similar antiquity), Bass Point is considered to be one of the most significant Aboriginal archaeological sites to be excavated in NSW. It is considered to be a rare example of established occupation and continues to be of exceptionally high significance to the Aboriginal people of NSW.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1896/&gt;

Upon the arrival of European settlers to the Illawarra region in 1803, the land of Bass Point was granted to D'Arcy Wentworth, a wealthy colonial official and the Principal Surgeon and Principal Superintendent of Police. A significant colonial figure, Wentworth developed a substantial estate (of some {{convert|13050|acre|ha|order=flip}} - including Bass Point) from 1821-1865 and was influential in the development of the Shellharbour area.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1896/&gt;

Bass Point also had a significant but brief association with Captain James Cook who first made note of the region and its Aboriginal occupants as the Endeavour sailed by the coastline in April 1770.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1896/&gt;

Bass Point has another brief association with the colonial explorers George Bass and Matthew Flinders who made the first recorded European visit to the region in 1796. The contemporary naming of Bass Point commemorates these early explorations.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1896/&gt;

Bass Point Reserve has significant natural features and habitats that contribute to its aesthetic value. A prominent headland in the region, Bass Point contains elements of bush, beach and ocean that create a visually spectacular environment of both land and sea.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1896/&gt;

This key coastal landscape is also regarded as highly significant for its biodiversity and pristine condition. The relatively undisturbed environment supports a variety of common, rare and endangered fauna and flora species - including littoral rainforest and habitats for the endangered grey nurse shark and sea grasses.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1896/&gt;

The maritime landscape around Bass Point Reserve also contains a number of shipwrecks and archaeological evidence, dating from 1879. The most significant and well known, the Cities Service Boston, was wrecked in May 1943 and a memorial was erected at Boston Point to commemorate the Australian lives lost in the rescue.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1896/&gt;

Bass Point Reserve was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 18 January 2013 having satisfied the following criteria.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1896/&gt;

'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''

Bass Point Reserve is of state heritage significance for both its Aboriginal and European values and its pre- and post-contact history.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1896/&gt;

Official European settlement in the Illawarra region and on Bass Point Reserve, started from 1817 with the division of land and the establishment of agriculture and industry. The development of basalt mining on the point saw the growth of shipping in the region but, due to the hazardous conditions of the new transport route, a number of ships were wrecked off the Bass Point coastline - the ''Bertha'' (1879); ''Our Own'' (1880); ''Alexander Berry'' (1901); ''Comboyne'' (1920); ''Kiltobranks'' (1924); and the ''Cities Service Boston'' (1943).&lt;ref name=nswshr-1896/&gt;

'''The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history.'''

Bass Point Reserve is of state heritage significance for its association with a number of significant people and groups.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1896/&gt;

Traditionally, and for some 20,000 years prior to European settlement, the land has been occupied by the Elouera people of the Dharawal group. The longevity of the use of Bass Point as a camping and meeting place indicates its significance to the Aboriginal people of this region. Documentary, archaeological and oral evidence indicate that Bass Point was, and is, considered to be an extremely important place by local Aboriginal people and that "the general "feeling" about the place was that it was a good and happy place".&lt;ref&gt;'Bass Point Reserve: Draft Plan of Management (Volume 1: Reference Document)', 2000, p43.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the significance of this site to the Elouera people stretches for thousands of years into the past, its importance to the contemporary Aboriginal community continues today.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1896/&gt;

Bass Point also had a significant, but brief, association with Captain James Cook and the Endeavour. As the Endeavour sailed by the Illawarra coastline in April 1770, journal notes were made about their observations of the landscape and the traditional Aboriginal occupants. There is evidence to suggest that Cook attempted a landing in the region but abandoned the effort due to dangerous conditions. Had this landing attempt succeeded, it would have been the first on Australian soil - predating that at Botany Bay.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1896/&gt;

The first recorded European visit to the region was by colonial explorers and naval men, George Bass and Matthew Flinders, in 1796. Exploring the unknown country to observe and report back to the colony, Bass and Flinders were most-likely the first contact the Elouera people had had with European settlers. The contemporary naming of Bass Point commemorates the initial explorations of these significant explorers.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1896/&gt;

After the Illawarra region had been officially settled, the land was divided into free grants, and Bass Point was granted to D'Arcy Wentworth, a wealthy colonial official and medical practitioner. Wentworth had arrived in Australia as a free settler and Assistant Surgeon on a convict fleet in 1790. By 1811, Governor Lachlan Macquarie had appointed him Principal Surgeon and Principal Superintendent of Police. Also a founding member of the Bank of NSW, Wentworth is a significant colonial figure who developed a substantial estate (of some 13,050 acres, including Bass Point) from 1821-1865.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1896/&gt;

'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''

Bass Point Reserve has significant natural features and habitats that contribute to its aesthetic value. A prominent headland in the region, Bass Point contains important elements of bush, beach and ocean that create a visually spectacular environment of both land and sea. This key coastal landscape has significant aesthetic value and its general visitation numbers reflects the public's ongoing admiration for the natural beauty of this site.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1896/&gt;

'''The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.'''

The social significance of Bass Point Reserve remains strong in contemporary Aboriginal culture. There is a widespread understanding that the Elouera people (a subdivision of the larger Dharawal group) are the traditional occupants of the land of the Illawarra region. The coastal landscape at Bass Point supported the established camp sites of the Aboriginal people and provided a diverse and sustainable natural source of food and fresh water for some 20,000 years prior to European arrival to Australia. Following white settlement, the Aboriginal people continued to use the Bass Point area as a camp site and meeting place.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1896/&gt;

The designation of Bass Point Reserve has ensured that the natural value of the site is conserved and is still available for use by the Aboriginal people of the region today. The site is also widely used by visitors as a tourist and recreational resource.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1896/&gt;

'''The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''

Bass Point Reserve has state heritage significance for its potential to reveal further information through archaeological research. Although it has been subject to earlier archaeological investigations (in 1969/70 by Dr Sandra Bowdler and again in 1974 by Hughes &amp; Sullivan), there is great potential for further archaeological discoveries, both terrestrial and maritime.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1896/&gt;

Through Dr Bowdler's investigation, it was concluded that there is potential that the individual shell midden sites on the northern shoreline could represent one single and continuous midden.

'''Beacon Power''' is an [[United States|American]] [[limited liability company]] and wholly owned subsidiary of Rockland Capital LLC specializing in [[flywheel]]-based [[flywheel energy storage|energy storage]] headquartered in [[Tyngsborough, Massachusetts|Tyngsboro, Massachusetts]].  Beacon designs and develops products aimed at [[utility frequency]] regulation for power grid operations.

The storage systems are designed to help utilities match supply with varying demand by storing excess power in arrays of {{convert|2800|lb|kg|adj=on}} flywheels at off-peak times for use during peak demand.&lt;ref name=NECN&gt;Peter Howe (June 13, 2008).

==History==
Beacon Power was founded in [[Woburn, Massachusetts]] in 1997 as a subsidiary of [[SatCon Technology Corporation]], a maker of alternative energy management systems. The company went public in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.masshightech.com/stories/2008/09/29/daily1-SatCon-sells-of-two-units-for-56M.html SatCon sells off two units for $5.6M]", ''Mass High Tech'' (September 29, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Beacon Power's Affiliate, SatCon Technology Corporation, to Distribute Five Million Beacon Power Shares |publisher=SatCon Technology Corporation |date=September 13, 2001 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_/ai_78228462}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steven Syre (August 14, 2003).

In June 2008, Beacon Power opened new headquarters in Tyngsboro, with financing from Massachusetts state agencies. The new facility is intended to support an expansion of the company's operation.&lt;ref name=NECN /&gt;

In 2009 Beacon received a loan guarantee from the [[United States Department of Energy]] (DOE) for $43 million to build a 20-megawatt flywheel power plant in [[Stephentown, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Fact Sheet: The Department of Energy's Loan Programs |date=March 5, 2010 |url=https://www.energy.gov/8719.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527034110/http://www.energy.gov/8719.htm |archivedate=2010-05-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Beacon Power, Nordic Windpower Get $59M DOE Loan Guarantees |date=July 2, 2009 |url=http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/beacon-power-nordic-windpower-get-59m-doe-loan-guarantees/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26849">The '''Bose&amp;ndash;Hubbard model''' gives a description of the physics of interacting spinless [[boson]]s on a [[Lattice model (physics)|lattice]].  It is closely related to the [[Hubbard model]] which originated in [[solid-state physics]] as an approximate description of superconducting systems and the motion of electrons between the atoms of a crystalline solid. The model was first introduced by Gersch and Knollman&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Gersch | first1 = H. | last2 = Knollman | first2 = G. | doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.129.959 | title = Quantum Cell Model for Bosons | journal = Physical Review | volume = 129 | issue = 2 | pages = 959 | year = 1963 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 1963PhRv..129..959G }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1963 in the context of granular superconductors. (The term '[[Satyendra Nath Bose|Bose]]' in its name refers to the fact that the particles in the system are [[boson]]ic.) The model rose to prominence in the 1980s after it was found to capture the essence of the superfluid-insulator transition in a way that was much more mathematically tractable than fermionic metal-insulator models.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ma|first=M.|last2=Halperin|first2=B. I.|last3=Lee|first3=P. A.|date=1986-09-01|title=Strongly disordered superfluids: Quantum fluctuations and critical behavior|journal=Physical Review B|volume=34|issue=5|pages=3136–3143|doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.34.3136|bibcode = 1986PhRvB..34.3136M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Giamarchi|first=T.|last2=Schulz|first2=H.

The Bose&amp;ndash;Hubbard model can be used to describe physical systems such as bosonic atoms in an [[optical lattice]],&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; as well as certain magnetic insulators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Giamarchi|first=Thierry|last2=Rüegg|first2=Christian|last3=Tchernyshyov|first3=Oleg|title=Bose–Einstein condensation in magnetic insulators|journal=Nature Physics|volume=4|issue=3|pages=198–204|doi=10.1038/nphys893|arxiv = 0712.2250 |bibcode = 2008NatPh...4..198G |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zapf|first=Vivien|last2=Jaime|first2=Marcelo|last3=Batista|first3=C. D.|date=2014-05-15|title=Bose-Einstein condensation in quantum magnets|journal=Reviews of Modern Physics|volume=86|issue=2|pages=563–614|doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.86.563|bibcode=2014RvMP...86..563Z|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1233977}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, it can also be generalized and applied to Bose&amp;ndash;Fermi mixtures, in which case the corresponding [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] is called the Bose&amp;ndash;Fermi&amp;ndash;Hubbard Hamiltonian.

== The Hamiltonian ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Bose Hubbard phase diagram.jpg|thumb|right|350px|The zero-temperature phase diagram of the Bose&amp;ndash;Hubbard model. MI = Mott insulator, SF = superfluid.]] --&gt;
The physics of this model is given by the Bose&amp;ndash;Hubbard Hamiltonian:

&lt;math&gt; H = -t \sum_{ \left\langle i, j \right\rangle } \hat{b}^{\dagger}_i \hat{b}_j + \frac{U}{2} \sum_{i} \hat{n}_i \left( \hat{n}_i - 1 \right) - \mu \sum_i \hat{n}_i &lt;/math&gt;.

Here, &lt;math&gt;\left\langle i, j \right\rangle&lt;/math&gt; denotes summation over all neighboring lattice sites &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;, while &lt;math&gt;\hat{b}^{\dagger}_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{b}^{}_i&lt;/math&gt; are regular bosonic [[creation and annihilation operators]] such that &lt;math&gt;\hat{n}_i = \hat{b}^{\dagger}_i \hat{b}_i&lt;/math&gt; gives the number of particles on site &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;. The model is parametrized by the hopping amplitude &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; describing the mobility of bosons in the lattice, the on-site interaction &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; which can be attractive (&lt;math&gt;U &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt;) or repulsive (&lt;math&gt;U &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;), and the [[chemical potential]] &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;, which essentially sets the total number of particles. If unspecified, typically the phrase 'Bose–Hubbard model' refers to the case where the on-site interaction is repulsive.

This Hamiltonian has a global &lt;math&gt;U(1)&lt;/math&gt; symmetry, which means that it is invariant (i.e. its physical properties are unchanged) by the transformation &lt;math&gt;\hat{b}_i \rightarrow e^{i \theta} \hat{b}_i&lt;/math&gt;. In a [[Superfluidity|superfluid]] phase, this symmetry is [[Spontaneous symmetry breaking|spontaneously broken]].

=== Hilbert space ===
The dimension of the [[Hilbert space]] of the Bose&amp;ndash;Hubbard model is given by &lt;math&gt; D_{b}= (N_{b}+L-1)!/N_{b}!(L-1)! &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;N_{b}&lt;/math&gt; is the total number of particles, while &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; denotes the total number of lattice sites. At fixed &lt;math&gt; N_b &lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt; L &lt;/math&gt;, the Hilbert space dimension &lt;math&gt; D_b &lt;/math&gt; grows polynomially, but at a fixed density of &lt;math&gt; n_b &lt;/math&gt; bosons per site, it grows exponentially as &lt;math display="inline"&gt;D_b \sim \left[ (1 + n_b) \left( 1 + \frac{1}{n_b} \right)^{n_b} \right]^L&lt;/math&gt;.  Analogous Hamiltonians may be formulated to describe spinless fermions (the Fermi-Hubbard model) or mixtures of different atom species (Bose&amp;ndash;Fermi mixtures, for example). In the case of a mixture, the Hilbert space is simply the tensor product of the Hilbert spaces of the individual species. Typically additional terms need to be included to model interaction between species.

== Phase diagram==
At zero temperature, the Bose&amp;ndash;Hubbard model (in the absence of disorder) is in either a [[Mott insulators|Mott insulating]] state at small &lt;math&gt;t / U &lt;/math&gt;, or in a [[superfluid]] state at large &lt;math&gt; t / U &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kühner | first1 = T. | last2 = Monien | first2 = H. | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevB.58.R14741 | title = Phases of the one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model | journal = Physical Review B | volume = 58 | issue = 22 | pages = R14741 | year = 1998 | pmid =  | pmc = |arxiv = cond-mat/9712307 |bibcode = 1998PhRvB..5814741K }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mott insulating phases are characterized by integer boson densities, by the existence of an [[band gap|energy gap]] for particle-hole excitations, and by zero [[compressibility]]. The superfluid is characterized by long-range phase coherence, a spontaneous breaking of the Hamiltonian's continuous &lt;math&gt;U(1)&lt;/math&gt; symmetry, a non-zero compressibility and superfluid susceptibility. At non-zero temperature, in certain parameter regimes there will also be a regular fluid phase which does not break the &lt;math&gt;U(1)&lt;/math&gt; symmetry and does not display phase coherence. Both of these phases have been experimentally observed in ultracold atomic gases.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In the presence of disorder, a third, ‘‘[[Bose glass]]'' phase exists.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Bose glass is a [[Griffiths phase]], and can be thought of as a Mott insulator containing rare 'puddles' of superfluid. These superfluid pools are not connected to each other, so the system remains insulating, but their presence significantly changes the thermodynamics of the model. The Bose glass phase is characterized by a finite compressibility, the absence of a gap, and by an infinite [[superfluid|superfluid susceptibility]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.40.546 |title=Boson localization and the superfluid-insulator transition |year=1989 |last1=Fisher |first1=Matthew P.

The Bose glass has been shown to have a non-zero [[Edwards-Anderson model|Edwards-Anderson order parameter]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morrison|first=S.|last2=Kantian|first2=A.|last3=Daley|first3=A.

The phases of the clean Bose–Hubbard model can be described using a [[Mean field theory|mean-field]] Hamiltonian:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.cambridge.org/fr/academic/subjects/physics/condensed-matter-physics-nanoscience-and-mesoscopic-physics/quantum-phase-transitions-2nd-edition?format=HB&amp;isbn=9780521514682|title=Quantum phase transitions|last=Sachdev|first=Subir|date=|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2011|isbn=9780521514682|location=|pages=|oclc=693207153}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;math display="block"&gt;\begin{align}
H_{\textrm{MF}}&amp;=\sum_i \left[ -\mu \hat{n}_i +\frac{U}{2} \hat{n}_i(\hat{n}_i-1)-zt(\psi^{*} \hat{b}_i +\psi\hat{b}^{\dagger}_i)+zt\psi^{*}\psi \right]
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;where &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; is the lattice [[Coordination number|co-ordination number]]. This can be obtained from the full Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian by setting &lt;math&gt;\hat{b}_{i} \rightarrow \psi+\delta \hat{b}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\psi=\langle \hat{b}_{i} \rangle&lt;/math&gt;, neglecting terms quadratic in &lt;math&gt;\delta \hat{b}_{i}&lt;/math&gt; (which we assume to be infinitesimal) and relabelling &lt;math&gt;\delta \hat{b}_{i} \rightarrow \hat{b}_{i}&lt;/math&gt;. Because this decoupling breaks the &lt;math&gt;U(1)&lt;/math&gt; symmetry of the initial Hamiltonian for all non-zero values of &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;, this parameter acts as a [[superfluid]] [[order parameter]]. For simplicity, this decoupling assumes &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; to be the same on every site - this precludes exotic phases such as [[supersolid]]s or other inhomogeneous phases. (Other decouplings are of course possible if one wishes to allow for such phases.)

We can obtain the phase diagram by calculating the energy of this mean-field Hamiltonian using second-order [[Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbation theory]] and finding the condition for which &lt;math&gt;\psi \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;. To do this, we first write the Hamiltonian as a site-local piece plus a perturbation:&lt;math display="block"&gt;H_{\textrm{MF}}=\sum_{i}\left[ h^{(0)}_{i}-zt(\psi^{*} \hat{b}_i +\psi\hat{b}^{\dagger}_i) \right] \quad \textrm{with} \quad h^{(0)}_i=-\mu \hat{n}_i +\frac{U}{2} \hat{n}_i(\hat{n}_i-1)+zt\psi^{*}\psi&lt;/math&gt;where the bilinear terms &lt;math&gt;\psi^{*}\hat{b}_i&lt;/math&gt; and its conjugate are treated as the perturbation, as we assume the order parameter &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; to be small near the phase transition. The local term is diagonal in the [[Fock state|Fock basis]], giving the zeroth-order energy contribution:&lt;math display="block"&gt;E^{(0)}_m=-\mu m + \frac{U}{2}m(m-1)+zt |\psi|^{2}&lt;/math&gt;where &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is an integer that labels the filling of the Fock state. The perturbative piece can be treated with second-order perturbation theory, which leads to:&lt;math display="block"&gt;E^{(2)}_n=zt |\psi|^2 \sum_{n \neq m} \frac{|\langle m|(\hat{b}_{i}^{\dagger}+\hat{b}_{i})|n \rangle|^2}{E^{(0)}_n-E^{(0)}_m}
=-(zt)^2 |\psi|^{2} \left( \frac{m}{U(m-1)-\mu} + \frac{m+1}{\mu-U m} \right).&lt;/math&gt;We can then express the energy as a series expansion in even powers of the order parameter (also known as the [[Landau theory|Landau formalism]]):&lt;math display="block"&gt;E=const. + R |\psi|^2 + W |\psi|^4 +...&lt;/math&gt;After doing so, the condition for the mean-field, second-order phase transition between the Mott insulator and the superfluid phase is given by:&lt;math display="block"&gt;r=\frac{R}{zt}=1+zt \left( \frac{m}{U(m-1)-\mu} + \frac{m+1}{\mu-U m} \right)=0&lt;/math&gt;where the integer &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; describes the filling of the &lt;math&gt;m^{th}&lt;/math&gt; Mott insulating lobe. Plotting the line &lt;math&gt;r=0&lt;/math&gt; for different integer values of &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; will generate the boundary of the different Mott lobes, as shown in the phase diagram.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Implementation in optical lattices==
Ultracold atoms in [[optical lattice]]s are considered a standard realization of the Bose–Hubbard model. The ability to tune parameters of the model using simple experimental techniques and the lack of the lattice dynamics which are present in solid-state electronic systems mean that ultracold atoms offer a very clean, controllable realisation of the Bose–Hubbard model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Jaksch | first1 = D. | last2 = Bruder | first2 = C. | last3 = Cirac | first3 = J. | last4 = Gardiner | first4 = C. | last5 = Zoller | first5 = P. | title = Cold Bosonic Atoms in Optical Lattices | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.81.3108 | journal = Physical Review Letters | volume = 81 | issue = 15 | pages = 3108 | year = 1998 | pmid =  | pmc = |arxiv = cond-mat/9805329 |bibcode = 1998PhRvL..81.3108J }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Jaksch | first1 = D. | last2 = Zoller | first2 = P. | doi = 10.1016/j.aop.2004.09.010 | title = The cold atom Hubbard toolbox | journal = Annals of Physics | volume = 315 | issue = 1 | pages = 52 | year = 2005 | pmid =  | pmc = |arxiv = cond-mat/0410614 |bibcode = 2005AnPhy.315...52J | citeseerx = 10.1.1.305.9031 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The biggest downside with optical lattice technology is the trap lifetime, with atoms typically only being trapped for a few tens of seconds.

To see why ultracold atoms offer such a convenient realisation of Bose-Hubbard physics, we can derive the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian starting from the [[second quantization|second quantized]] Hamiltonian which describes a gas of ultracold atoms in the optical lattice potential. This Hamiltonian is given by the expression:

&lt;math&gt; H= \int {\rm d}^3 r \! \left[ \hat\psi^\dagger(\vec r) \left ( -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla^2 +V_{\rm latt.}(\vec r) \right) \hat\psi(\vec r) 
 + \frac{g}{2}\hat \psi^\dagger(\vec r)\hat\psi^\dagger(\vec r)\hat\psi(\vec r)\hat\psi(\vec r) - \mu \hat{\psi}^\dagger(\vec r)\hat\psi(\vec r)\right]
&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt; V_{latt} &lt;/math&gt;  is the optical lattice potential, &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is the (contact) interaction amplitude, and &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the chemical potential. The [[Tight binding|tight binding approximation]] results in the substitution &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\hat\psi(\vec r) = \sum\limits_i w_i^\alpha (\vec r) b_i^\alpha&lt;/math&gt;  which leads to the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian if one restricts the physics to the lowest band (&lt;math&gt;\alpha=0&lt;/math&gt;) and the interactions are local at the level of the discrete mode. Mathematically, this can be stated as the requirement that &lt;math display="inline"&gt; \int w_i^\alpha(\vec r)w_j^\beta(\vec r)w_k^\gamma(r)w_l^\delta(\vec r)\,{\rm d}^3 r=0&lt;/math&gt; except for case &lt;math&gt;i=j=k=l \wedge \alpha=\beta=\gamma=\delta=0&lt;/math&gt;. Here, &lt;math&gt;w_i^\alpha(\vec r) &lt;/math&gt; is a [[Wannier function]] for a particle in an optical lattice potential localized around site &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; of the lattice and for the &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;th [[Bloch wave|Bloch band]].&lt;ref name="Luhmann"/&gt;

===Subtleties and approximations===
The tight-binding approximation significantly simplifies the second quantized Hamiltonian, though it introduces several limitations at the same time:
* For single-site states with several particles in a single state, the interactions may couple to higher Bloch bands, which contradicts base assumptions. Still, a single band model is able to address low-energy physics of such setting but with parameters U and J becoming in fact density-dependent. Instead of one parameter U, the interaction energy of n particles may be described by &lt;math&gt;U_n&lt;/math&gt; close, but not equal to U.&lt;ref name="Luhmann"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lühmann | first1 = D.

* When considering (fast) lattice dynamics, additional terms should be added to the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian, so that the [[Schrödinger equation|time-dependent Schrödinger equation]] is obeyed in the (time-dependent) Wannier function basis. They come from the time dependence of Wannier functions.&lt;ref name="Sakmann2011"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Sakmann | first1 = K. | last2 = Streltsov | first2 = A. I. | last3 = Alon | first3 = O.

==Experimental results==
Quantum phase transitions in the Bose–Hubbard model were experimentally observed by Greiner et al.,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/415039a |title=Quantum phase transition from a superfluid to a Mott insulator in a gas of ultracold atoms |year=2002 |last1=Greiner |first1=Markus |last2=Mandel |first2=Olaf |last3=Esslinger |first3=Tilman |last4=Hänsch |first4=Theodor W. |last5=Bloch |first5=Immanuel |journal=Nature |volume=415 |issue=6867 |pages=39–44 |pmid=11780110|bibcode = 2002Natur.415...39G }}&lt;/ref&gt; and density dependent interaction parameters &lt;math&gt;U_n &lt;/math&gt; were observed by [[Immanuel Bloch|I.Bloch's]]  group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Will | first1 = S. | last2 = Best | first2 = T. | last3 = Schneider | first3 = U. | last4 = Hackermüller | first4 = L. | last5 = Lühmann | first5 = D.

==Further applications of the model==
The Bose–Hubbard model is also of interest to those working in the field of quantum computation and quantum information. Entanglement of ultra-cold atoms can be studied using this model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1088/1751-8113/40/28/S11 |title=Transport and entanglement generation in the Bose–Hubbard model |year=2007 |last1=Romero-Isart |first1=O |last2=Eckert |first2=K |last3=Rodó |first3=C |last4=Sanpera |first4=A |journal=Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and Theoretical |volume=40 |issue=28 |pages=8019–31|arxiv = quant-ph/0703177 |bibcode = 2007JPhA...40.8019R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Numerical simulation ==
In the calculation of low energy states the term proportional to &lt;math&gt;n^2 U &lt;/math&gt; means that large occupation of a single site is improbable, allowing for truncation of local Hilbert space to states containing at most &lt;math&gt;d &lt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; particles. Then the local Hilbert space dimension is &lt;math&gt;d+1.&lt;/math&gt; The dimension of the full Hilbert space grows exponentially with the number of sites in the lattice, therefore computer simulations are limited to the study of systems of 15-20 particles in 15-20 lattice sites. Experimental systems contain several millions lattice sites, with average filling above unity. For the numerical simulation of this model, an algorithm of exact diagonalization is presented in this paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1088/0143-0807/31/3/016 |title=Exact diagonalization: The Bose–Hubbard model as an example |year=2010 |last1=Zhang |first1=J M |last2=Dong |first2=R X |journal=European Journal of Physics |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=591–602|arxiv = 1102.4006 |bibcode = 2010EJPh...31..591Z }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One-dimensional lattices may be studied using [[density matrix renormalization group]] (DMRG) and related techniques such as [[time-evolving block decimation]] (TEBD). This includes to calculate the ground state of the Hamiltonian for systems of thousands of particles on thousands of lattice sites, and simulate its dynamics governed by the [[Schrödinger equation|Time-dependent Schrödinger equation]].

Higher dimensions are significantly more difficult due to the quick growth of [[quantum entanglement|entanglement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Eisert | first1 = J. | last2 = Cramer | first2 = M. | last3 = Plenio | first3 = M. B. | title = Colloquium: Area laws for the entanglement entropy | doi = 10.1103/RevModPhys.82.277 | journal = Reviews of Modern Physics | volume = 82 | issue = 1 | pages = 277 | year = 2010 | pmid =  | pmc = |arxiv = 0808.3773 |bibcode = 2010RvMP...82..277E }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All dimensions may be treated by [[Quantum Monte Carlo]] algorithms, which provide a way to study properties of thermal states of the Hamiltonian, as well as the particular the ground state.

==Generalizations==
Bose-Hubbard-like Hamiltonians may be derived for different physical systems containing ultracold atom gas in the periodic potential. They include, but are not limited to:
* systems with longer-ranged density-density interactions of the form &lt;math&gt; V n_i n_j &lt;/math&gt;, which may stabilise a [[supersolid]] phase for certain parameter values
* dimerised magnets, where spin-1/2 electrons are bound together in pairs called dimers which have bosonic excitation statistics and are described by a hard-core Bose–Hubbard model
* long-range dipolar interaction &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Góral | first1 = K. | last2 = Santos | first2 = L. | last3 = Lewenstein | first3 = M. | title = Quantum Phases of Dipolar Bosons in Optical Lattices | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.88.170406 | journal = Physical Review Letters | volume = 88 | issue = 17 | pages = 170406 | year = 2002 | pmid =  12005738| pmc = |arxiv = cond-mat/0112363 |bibcode = 2002PhRvL..88q0406G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* internal spin structure of atoms, for example due to trapping entire degenerate manifold of hyperfine spin states (for F=1 i leads to the spin-1 Bose–Hubbard model) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Tsuchiya | first1 = S. | last2 = Kurihara | first2 = S. | last3 = Kimura | first3 = T. | title = Superfluid–Mott insulator transition of spin-1 bosons in an optical lattice | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevA.70.043628 | journal = Physical Review A | volume = 70 | issue = 4 | pages = 043628 | year = 2004 | pmid =  | pmc = |arxiv = cond-mat/0209676 |bibcode = 2004PhRvA..70d3628T }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* situation where the gas feel presence of an additional potential for example for disordered systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Gurarie | first1 = V. | last2 = Pollet | first2 = L. | last3 = Prokof’Ev | first3 = N.

In the latter case inclusion of the disorder amounts to including extra term of the form: &lt;math&gt;H_I=V_d \sum\limits_i \cos(k i+\varphi) \hat{n}_i&lt;/math&gt;

'''''Campbell's Kingdom''''' is a 1957 British [[adventure film]] directed by [[Ralph Thomas]], based on the 1952 novel of the same name by [[Hammond Innes]]. The film stars [[Dirk Bogarde]] and [[Stanley Baker]], with [[Michael Craig (actor)|Michael Craig]], [[Barbara Murray]], [[James Robertson Justice]] and [[Sid James]] in support. The story is set in [[Alberta]], [[Canada]], and largely follows the principles of the [[Northern (genre)|Northwestern]] genre of film-making.

==Plot==
Recently diagnosed with a terminal disease, Bruce Campbell ([[Dirk Bogarde]]) unexpectedly finds himself the owner of a small valley in the [[Canada|Canadian]] [[Rocky Mountains]] as the result of a bequest from his grandfather.&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite web|last= Weiler |first= A.H. |date= 11 January 1960 |title= Movie Review - Campbell's Kingdom |url= https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?_r=1&amp;res=9C07E1DF1230EF3ABC4952DFB766838B679EDE |work= New York Times |accessdate= 2010-05-05 }} {{smaller|(Registration required.)}}&lt;/ref&gt; After travelling from England, Bruce arrives at "Campbell's Kingdom" (as the locals disparagingly call it) to find its existence under threat from the construction of a new [[hydroelectricity]] [[dam]]. Convinced that his grandfather was right and that the Kingdom may be prospective for [[Petroleum|oil]], the race is on to prove that there is oil under Campbell's Kingdom before the mining company building the dam can flood the valley. Standing in his way is corrupt construction contractor Owen Morgan ([[Stanley Baker]]), who resorts to dirty tricks in order to prevent Campbell from succeeding in his quest. However, Bruce is ably and enthusiastically assisted by love interest Jean Lucas ([[Barbara Murray]]), geologist Boy Bladen ([[Michael Craig (actor)|Michael Craig]]) and drilling contractor James MacDonald ([[James Robertson Justice]]). Unfortunately for Campbell the residents of the nearby town of Come Lucky invested heavily in his grandfather's schemes, only to feel cheated when his projects came to nothing. Gradually Bruce manages to turn them around by exposing the fraud and lies of Morgan and the mining company.

==Production==
Hammond Innes's novel was published in 1952 and was based on the Canadian oil boom of the late 1940s. Innes researched the novel extensively and it was a best seller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article18502317 |title=Hammond Innes Makes A Fortune From Writing Thrillers |newspaper=[[The Sunday Herald (Sydney)]] |issue=216 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=15 March 1953 |accessdate=13 May 2016 |page=13 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The story was serialised as ''Nothing to Lose''. Film rights were purchased prior to the novel's publication by the producing-directing team of [[Betty Box]] and [[Ralph Thomas]], who had just made ''The Venetian Bird''. [[Location scouting]] for the film began in August 1952, with Box and Thomas touring the [[Canadian Rockies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article57565366 |title=Round the studios. |newspaper=[[Sunday Mail (Adelaide)|The Mail (Adelaide, SA : 1912 - 1954)]] |location=Adelaide, SA |date=20 September 1952 |accessdate=31 October 2015 |page=7 Supplement: SUNDAY MAGAZINE |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article132183798 |title=FILM LOCATIONS CHOSEN BY U.K. WOMAN |newspaper=[[The Dubbo Liberal And Macquarie Advocate]] |volume=41, |issue=599 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=9 December 1952 |accessdate=13 May 2016 |page=4 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Canada Film Location Inspected
New York Times (1923-Current file) [New York, N.Y] 28 Aug 1952: 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

"That serial title refers to the hero's special armour," said Ralph Thomas. "He's a young Canadian whose friends help him strike oil on a piece of land willed by his grandfather to disprove the general belief that the old man was unhinged. And he happens to be fatally stricken. He's a dying man."&lt;ref name="new"&gt;BY WAY OF REPORT: Box -- Thomas Activities -- Cinema 16 Plans --

"There's quite a bit of room for suspense," said Betty Box. "For one thing a big oil company is obstructing him. Our climax will have the gusher flooded by a break in a huge dam. With an ingenious twist."&lt;ref name="new"/&gt;

[[Eric Ambler]] was assigned to write the script.&lt;ref&gt;OBSERVATIONS ON LONDON FILM SCENE: Economic Appraisal -Miss Shearer to Date -- Pioneer Epitaph
By STEPHEN WATTS LONDON.. New York Times (1923-Current file) [New York, N.Y] 22 Feb 1953: X5.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1954 [[Jack Hawkins]] and [[Shelley Winters]] were mentioned as possible stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article205436682 |title=MAGAZINE |newspaper=[[The Age]] |issue=31,069 |location=Victoria, Australia |date=30 November 1954 |accessdate=13 May 2016 |page=9 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, because it was an expensive project the film took a number of years to be financed. Box and Thomas had a major box office hit in ''[[Doctor in the House]]'' (1954) which turned [[Dirk Bogarde]] into a star. Bogarde was ideal casting for ''Campbell's Kingdom'' and he became attached to the project. The film was almost made after ''[[Doctor at Sea (film)|Doctor at Sea]]'' when there was a financial crisis in the British film industry and Rank requested Box, Thomas and Bogarde make a third "Doctor" film, ''[[Doctor at Large (film)|Doctor at Large]]'', instead. While this was done, Box, Ambler and Innes worked on the script to reduce the budget.&lt;ref&gt;Box p 146&lt;/ref&gt;

The tremendous success of ''[[Doctor at Large (film)|Doctor at Large]]'' led to Rank financing ''Campbell's Kingdom''. "We'd all earned a change of subject, we felt," wrote Box later.&lt;ref&gt;Box p 147&lt;/ref&gt;

The film would be one of a number of films made by the Rank Organisation in the 1950s to appeal to the international market. They tended to be adventure films shot on location overseas in colour based on some best selling novel. Other examples include ''[[Windom's Way]]'', ''[[Robbery Under Arms (1957 film)|Robbery Under Arms]]'', ''[[The Wind Cannot Read]]'', ''[[Nor the Moon by Night]]'' and ''[[Ferry to Hong Kong]]''.&lt;ref&gt;M. Chevalier Young at 69: Boulevardier Still in Demand; Rank Organization Flourishes
Scheuer, Philip K. Los Angeles Times (1923-Current File) [Los Angeles, Calif] 18 Feb 1958: A7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Box said Eric Ambler had a very different approach to writing to Hammond Innes. "Innes was a writer who spent as much time researching his books as he did writing them," she wrote. "Eric's books depend much more on characterisation, motivation and ideologies rather than realistic documentation. I remember him telling me that he hadn't even visited most of the countries he wrote about, and I sensed that he wasn't entirely happy working on ''Campbell's Kingdom''."&lt;ref&gt;Box p 148&lt;/ref&gt; Another writer, Robin Estridge, was hired to work on the script.

[[Ray Milland]] had tried to buy the rights to the novel. He offered to play the role of Campbell for no cash payment and a percentage of the profits, but Rank cast Bogarde.&lt;ref&gt;Box p 154&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the story is set in [[Alberta]], it was too expensive to film there. Box wrote, "In those days dollars were very scarce, the Treasury didn't want to know and by shooting in Europe we would save a considerable amount of money that would have been spent in transporting people and equipment across the Atlantic and on to the foothills of the Rockies."&lt;ref&gt;Box p 150&lt;/ref&gt; The landscape exteriors were shot in the Italian [[Dolomites]] and the rest was shot at [[Pinewood Studios]] outside [[London]].&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050225/locations IMDb: Locations for ''Campbell's Kingdom''] Retrieved 2012-11-21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rank"&gt;[https://books.google.com.au/books?id=UyYTDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA386&amp;lpg=PA386&amp;dq=vincent+porter+sue+harper&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=978Q3rMq7B&amp;sig=R2UhMp6T53KbfjIFniBqZYP0amw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjLzJmegsPMAhUB_2MKHZcZDfEQ6AEIQzAI#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''British Cinema of the 1950s: The Decline of Deference'' by Sue Harper, Vincent Porter Oxford University Press, 2003 p 53]&lt;/ref&gt;

Betty Box says three of the cast brought their wives on location to Italy - Michael Craig, Stanley Baker and Sid James - and all three were pregnant.&lt;ref&gt;Box p 156&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
===Box Office===
Box later wrote that the film "was released during one of Britain's worst flu epidemics - Asian flu - which didn't help at the box office" but that "overseas the movie was successful. We even sold it to the Russians. It took me an hour or two to work that one out... The dam bursts because the wicked capitalists in Canada use cheap cement!"&lt;ref&gt;Box p 166&lt;/ref&gt;

===Awards===
Dirk Bogarde won the ''Picturegoer'' Award for Best Actor for the film.

The film was released in the US in 1960.

===Contemporary Reputation===
[[Richard Gregson]], film producer, agent and brother of actor Michael Craig, later gave ''Campbell's Kingdom'' as an example of the output of Rank under [[Sir John Davis]] in the late 50s:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Those awful middle class pictures that had no meaning for anyone, because somehow he couldn't come to terms with the fact that the vast majority of people in this country were lower middle class and working class people. So all those boring tales like ''Campbell's Kingdom'' had nothing to do with real life. If you are clever enough as [[Alexander Korda|Korda]] and [[Michael Balcon|Balcon]] were, you can get away with it, but Davis wasn't. It was very square entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;Brian McFarlane, ''An Autobiography of British Cinema'' p 250&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
BFI Screenonline said ''Campbell's Kingdom'', along with later Bogarde-Box-Thomas adventure films such as ''[[The Wind Cannot Read]]'' and ''[[The High Bright Sun]]'' "could have benefited from a more conventionally rugged leading man" than Bogarde.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/507764/ Ralph Thomas] at [[BFI Screenonline]]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5451">In [[chemistry]], a '''chemical transport reaction''' describes a process for purification and [[crystallization]] of non-[[volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] [[solid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Binnewies, Robert Glaum, Marcus Schmidt, Peer Schmidt "Chemical Vapor Transport Reactions – A Historical Review" Zeitschrift für anorganische und allgemeine Chemie 2013, Volume 639, pages 219–229. {{DOI|10.1002/zaac.201300048}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The process is also responsible for certain aspects of mineral growth from the effluent of [[volcano]]es.  The technique is distinct from [[chemical vapor deposition]], which usually entails decomposition of molecular precursors (e.g. SiH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;  → Si + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and which gives conformal coatings.

The technique, which was popularized by Schäfer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 | author = Günther Rienäcker, Josef Goubeau 
 | title = Professor Harald Schäfer
 | journal = [[Zeitschrift für anorganische und allgemeine Chemie]]
 | year = 1973

"Chemical Transport Reactions" Academic Press, New York, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt;  The volatile derivative migrates throughout a sealed reactor, typically a sealed and evacuated glass tube heated in a [[tube furnace]].  Because the tube is under a temperature gradient, the [[volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] derivative reverts to the parent solid and the transport agent is released at the end opposite to which it originated (see next section).  The transport agent is thus [[catalyst|catalytic]].  The technique requires that the two ends of the tube (which contains the sample to be crystallized) be maintained at different temperatures.  So-called two-zone tube furnaces are employed for this purpose. The method derives from the [[crystal bar process|Van Arkel de Boer process]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/zaac.19251480133 | title =  Darstellung von reinem Titanium-, Zirkonium-, Hafnium- und Thoriummetall | first = A. E. | last = van Arkel |author2=de Boer, J. H. | volume = 148 | issue = 1 | pages =345–350 | year = 1925 | journal = Zeitschrift für anorganische und allgemeine Chemie | language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was used for the purification of titanium and vanadium and uses iodine as the transport agent.

==Cases of the exothermic and endothermic reactions of the transporting agent==
Transport reactions are classified according to the [[thermodynamic]]s of the reaction between the solid and the transporting agent.  When the reaction is [[exothermic]], then the solid of interest is transported from the cooler end (which can be quite hot) of the reactor to a hot end, where the equilibrium constant is less favorable and the crystals grow.  The reaction of [[molybdenum dioxide]] with the transporting agent [[iodine]] is an exothermic process, thus the MoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; migrates from the cooler end (700 °C) to the hotter end (900 °C):
:MoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  {{eqm}}  MoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  ΔH&lt;sub&gt;rxn&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 0 (exothermic)
Using 10 milligrams of iodine for 4 grams of the solid, the process requires several days.  

Alternatively, when the reaction of the solid and the transport agent is endothermic, the solid is transported from a hot zone to a cooler one. For example:
:[[Iron(III) oxide|Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]  +  6 [[hydrogen chloride|HCl]]  {{eqm}}  [[Iron(III) chloride|Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]]+ 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O  ΔH&lt;sub&gt;rxn&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 0 (endothermic)
The sample of iron(III) oxide is maintained at 1000 °C, and the product is grown at 750 °C.  HCl is the transport agent.  Crystals of [[hematite]] are reportedly observed at the mouths of volcanoes because of chemical transport reactions whereby volcanic hydrogen chloride volatilizes iron(III) oxides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Halogen lamp==
A similar reaction like that of MoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is used in [[halogen lamp]]s. The tungsten is evaporated from the tungsten filament and converted with traces of oxygen and iodine into the WO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, at the high temperatures near the filament the compound decomposes back to tungsten, oxygen and iodine. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

[[File:Sorghum.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A grain sorghum cultivar]]
'''Commercial sorghum''' is the cultivation and commercial exploitation of species of grasses within the genus ''[[Sorghum]]'' (often ''[[Sorghum bicolor|S. bicolor]]''). These plants are used for grain, fibre and [[fodder]]. The plants are cultivated in warmer climates worldwide. Commercial ''Sorghum'' species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of [[Africa]] and [[Asia]].

Other names include ''durra'', Egyptian millet, ''feterita'', Guinea corn, ''jwari'' ज्वारी ([[Marathi language|Marathi]]), ''jowar'', ''juwar'', milo, ''shallu'', Sudan grass, ''cholam'' (Tamil), ''jola''/ಜೋಳ (Kannada), ''jonnalu'' (Telugu), ''gaoliang'' ([[:zh:高粱]]), great millet, ''kafir'' corn, ''dura'', ''dari'', ''mtama'', and ''solam''.

Sorghum has been, for centuries, one of the most important [[staple food]]s for millions of poor rural people in the semiarid tropics of Asia and Africa. For some impoverished regions of the world, sorghum remains a principal source of energy, protein, vitamins and minerals. Sorghum grows in harsh environments where other crops do not grow well, just like other staple foods, such as [[cassava]], that are common in impoverished regions of the world. It is usually grown without application of any fertilizers or other inputs by a multitude of small-holder farmers in many countries.&lt;ref name=fao1&gt;{{cite web|title=Sorghum and millet in human nutrition|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|year=1995|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/T0818E/T0818E00.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grain sorghum is the third most important cereal crop grown in the United States and the fifth most important cereal crop grown in the world. In 2010, Nigeria was the world's largest producer of grain sorghum, followed by the United States and India. In developed countries, and increasingly in developing countries such as India, the predominant use of sorghum is as fodder for poultry and cattle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Industrial Utilization of Sorghum in India|publisher=ICRISAT, India|date=December 2007|url=http://www.icrisat.org/journal/mpii/v3i1/impi1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sorghum|publisher=United States Grain Council|date=November 2010|url=http://www.grains.org/sorghum|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100823004012/http://www.grains.org/sorghum|archivedate=2010-08-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leading exporters in 2010 were the United States, Australia and Argentina; Mexico was the largest importer of sorghum.

An international effort is under way to improve sorghum farming. The [[International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics]] ([[ICRISAT]]) has improved sorghum using traditional genetic improvement and integrated genetic and natural resources management practices. New varieties of sorghum from ICRISAT has now resulted in India producing 7 tons per hectare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rajulapudi|first=Srinivas|title=India beats China in sorghum production|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/india-beats-china-in-sorghum-production/article5791021.ece|publisher=The Hindu|accessdate=17 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some 194 improved cultivars are now planted worldwide. In [[India]], increases in sorghum productivity resulting from improved cultivars have freed up six million hectares of land, enabling farmers to diversify into high-income cash crops and boost their livelihoods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://resourcespace.icrisat.ac.in/filestore/1/0/3/7_7f0990ec0622d50/1037_94e3244b87cb47b.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120043052/http://resourcespace.icrisat.ac.in/filestore/1/0/3/7_7f0990ec0622d50/1037_94e3244b87cb47b.pdf |archivedate=2016-01-20 |df= }} ''Sorghum, a crop of substance''.

The last wild relatives of commercial sorghum are currently confined to Africa south of the Sahara — although Zohary and Hopf add "perhaps" [[Yemen]] and [[Sudan]] — indicating its domestication took place there. However, note Zohary and Hopf, "the archaeological exploration of sub-Saharan Africa is yet in its early stages, and we still lack critical information for determining where and when sorghum could have been taken into cultivation."&lt;ref name="Zohary &amp; Hopf"&gt;Daniel Zohary and Maria Hopf, ''Domestication of plants in the Old World'', third edition (Oxford: University Press, 2000), p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; Although rich finds of ''[[Sorghum bicolor|S. bicolor]]'' have been recovered from [[Qasr Ibrim]] in Egyptian [[Nubia]], the wild examples have been dated to ''circa'' 800–600 BCE, and the domesticated ones no earlier than CE 100. The earliest archeological evidence comes from sites dated to the second millennium BC in [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] — where ''S. bicolor'' is not native. These incongruous finds have been interpreted, according again to Zohary and Hopf,

: as indicating: (i) an even earlier domestication in Africa, and (ii) an early migration of domestic sorghum, from East Africa into the Indian subcontinent. This interpretation got further support because several other African grain crops, namely: [[pearl millet]] ''Pennisetum glaucum'' (L.) R. Br., [[cow pea]] ''Vigna unguiculata'' (L.) Walp., and [[hyacinth bean]] ''Lablab purpureus'' (L.) Sweet show similar patterns. Their wild progenitors are restricted to Africa.&lt;ref name="Zohary &amp; Hopf"/&gt;

Most cultivated varieties of sorghum can be traced back to Africa, where they grow on savanna lands. During the [[Muslim Agricultural Revolution]], sorghum was planted extensively in parts of the [[Middle East]], [[North Africa]] and [[Europe]].&lt;ref name = W12-14&gt;Watson, p. 12–14.&lt;/ref&gt; The name "sorghum" comes from Italian "sorgo", in turn from Latin "Syricum (granum)" meaning "grain of Syria".

Despite the antiquity of sorghum, it arrived late to the Near East. It was unknown in the Mediterranean area into [[Roman Empire|Roman]] times. Tenth century records indicate it was widely grown in [[Iraq]], and became the principal food of [[Kirman]] in [[Persia]]. In addition to the eastern parts of the [[Muslim world]], the crop was also grown in [[Egypt]] and later in [[Islamic Spain]]. From Islamic Spain, it was introduced to Christian Spain and then France (by the 12th century). In the Muslim world, sorghum was grown usually in areas where the soil was poor or the weather too hot and dry to grow other crops.&lt;ref name = W12-14/&gt;

Sorghum is well adapted to growth in hot, arid or semiarid areas. The many subspecies are divided into four groups — [[grain sorghum]]s (such as milo), grass sorghums (for pasture and hay), [[sweet sorghum]]s (formerly called "[[Guinea (region)|Guinea]] corn", used to produce [[sorghum syrup]]s), and broom corn (for brooms and brushes). The name "sweet sorghum" is used to identify varieties of ''S. bicolor'' that are sweet and juicy.

==Cultivation and uses==
[[File:Massaggocad1.jpg|thumb|right|Bag of [[Somalian cuisine|Somali]] commercial sorghum (''massaggo'').]]
Sorghum is used for food, [[fodder]], and the production of [[alcoholic beverage]]s. It is [[xerophyte|drought-tolerant]] and heat-tolerant, and is especially important in [[arid]] regions. It is an important [[food crop]] in [[Africa]], [[Central America]], and [[South Asia]], and is the "fifth most important [[cereal]] crop grown in the world".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.grains.org/index.ww&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use as fodder===
The [[FAO]] reports that 440,000 square kilometres were devoted worldwide to sorghum production in 2004. In the US, sorghum grain is used primarily as a [[maize]] (corn) substitute for livestock feed because their nutritional values are very similar. Some hybrids commonly grown for feed have been developed to deter birds, and therefore contain a high concentration of tannins and phenolic compounds, which causes the need for additional processing to allow the grain to be digested by cattle.

===Production trends===
FAO reported the [[United States of America]] was the top producer of sorghum in 2009, with a harvest of 9.7 million tonnes. The next four major producers of sorghum, in decreasing quantities, were [[India]], [[Nigeria]], [[Sudan]] and [[Ethiopia]]. The other major sorghum producing regions in the world, by harvested quantities, were: [[Australia]], [[Brazil]], [[China]], [[Burkina Faso]], [[Argentina]], [[Mali]], [[Cameroon]], [[Egypt]], [[Niger]], [[Tanzania]], [[Chad]], [[Uganda]], [[Mozambique]], [[Venezuela]], and [[Ghana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Agricultural Production, Worldwide, 2009|publisher=FAOSTAT, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|year=2010|url=http://faostat.fao.org/site/339/default.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the future, use of sorghum may increase in Tanzania, as farmers replace maize with the drought-resistant crop in areas where rainfall declines due to climate change. Following lobbying by the [[ICRISAT]]-led Hope Project, the government recently included improved varieties of sorghum in its seed subsidy programme and agreed to provide a fertiliser subsidy programme for sorghum for the first time. This means that the government will buy seed from seed companies and sell it to farmers at almost half the market price. Tanzania's farmers have reported that improved sorghum varieties grow quickly, demand less labour and are more resistant to pests and diseases.&lt;ref&gt;Wangari, C. [[ICRISAT]] [http://resourcespace.icrisat.ac.in/filestore/1/1/5/5_cf1bdd2328eca5f/1155_008c9092db4823e.pdf ''Tanzania's government signs off on sorghum''] Thomson Reuters Foundation, 22 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The world harvested 55.6 million tonnes of sorghum in 2010. The world average annual yield for the 2010 sorghum crop was 1.37 tonnes per hectare. The most productive farms of sorghum were in [[Jordan]], where the national average annual yield was 12.7 tonnes per hectare. The national annual average yield in world's largest producing country, the USA, was 4.5 tonnes per hectare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Crop Production, Worldwide, 2010 data|publisher=FAOSTAT, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|year=2011|url=http://faostat.fao.org/site/567/DesktopDefault.aspx?PageID=567#ancor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The allocation of farm area to sorghum crops has been dropping, while the yields per hectare have been increasing. The biggest sorghum crop the world produced in the last 40 years was in 1985, with 77.6 million tonnes harvested that year.

===Culinary use===
In arid, less developed regions of the world, sorghum is an important food crop, especially for subsistence farmers. It is used to make such foods as [[couscous]], sorghum flour, [[porridge]] and [[molasses]].

''[[Bhakri]]'' (''[[jolada rotti]]'' in northern [[Karnataka]]), a variety of unleavened [[bread]] usually made from sorghum, is the staple diet in many parts of India, such as [[Maharashtra]] state and northern [[Karnataka]] state. In eastern Karnataka and the [[Rayalaseema]] area of [[Andhra Pradesh]], ''[[roti]]'' (''jonna rotte'') made with sorghum is the staple food.
[[File:Popcorn and pop sorghum.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Popcorn (for size comparison) left, and popped sorghum seeds, right]]
In South Africa, sorghum meal is often eaten as a stiff porridge much like pap. It is called ''mabele'' in Northern Sotho and "brown porridge" in English. The porridge can be served with ''maswi'' (soured milk) or ''merogo'' (a mixture of boiled greens much like collard greens or spinach).

In Ethiopia, sorghum is [[Fermentation|fermented]] to make [[injera]] flatbread, and in Sudan it is fermented to make [[kisra]].&lt;ref name="isbn9780471242376"&gt;{{cite book|isbn=9780471242376|title=Sorghum: Origin, History, Technology, and Production (Wiley Series in Crop Science)|last1=Smith|first1= C. Wayne|last2=Frederiksen|first2= Richard A.|publisher=Wiley}}&lt;/ref&gt; In India, [[dosa]] is sometimes made with a sorghum-grain mixture, but rice is more commonly used in place of sorghum.&lt;ref name="isbn9780471242376"/&gt;

In the [[cuisine of the Southern United States]], [[sorghum syrup]] was used as a sweet [[condiment]], much as [[maple syrup]] was used in the North, usually for biscuits, corn bread, pancakes, hot cereals or baked beans. It is uncommon today.

In [[Arab cuisine]], the unmilled grain is often cooked to make [[couscous]], [[porridge]]s, [[soup]]s, and [[cake]]s. Many poor use it, along with other [[flour]]s or [[starch]]es, to make [[bread]]. The [[seed]]s and [[Plant stem|stalks]] are fed to [[cattle]] and [[poultry]]. Some [[variety (botany)|varieties]] have been used for [[thatch]], [[fencing]], [[basket]]s, [[brush]]es and [[broom]]s, and stalks have been used as [[fuel]]. [[Medicine in medieval Islam|Medieval Islamic texts list medical]] uses for the plant.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, p. 9. In Northern Karnataka in India, they make ''chappathis'' from ''jola''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sorghum seeds can be popped in the same manner as [[popcorn]] (i.e., with oil or hot air, etc.), although the popped kernels are smaller than popcorn (see photo on the right).

Sorghum sometimes is used for making [[tortilla]]s (e.g., in Central America).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=7872831 | volume=43 | issue=4 | title=The tortilla making properties of two improved maicillo cultivars from Honduras |date=December 1993 | journal=Arch Latinoam Nutr | pages=299–303|last1=Serna-Saldivar|first1=SO|last2=Gómez|first2=MH|last3=Gómez|first3=F|last4=Meckenstock|first4=D|last5=Cossette|first5=C|last6=Rooney|first6=LW |display-authors=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In El Salvador, they sometimes use sorghum (''maicillo'') to make tortillas when there is not enough corn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elsalvador.com/noticias/2005/08/08/negocios/neg5.asp |title=Cultivarán el maicillo para producir miel: 8 de Agosto 2005 .::.

Since 2000, sorghum has come into increasing use in homemade and commercial breads and cereals made specifically for the [[gluten-free diet]].

===Alcoholic beverages===
In [[China]], sorghum is the most important ingredient for the production of [[Baijiu|distilled beverages]], such as ''[[maotai]]'' and ''[[kaoliang wine]]'', as seen in the 1987 film ''[[Red Sorghum (film)|Red Sorghum]]''.

====Sorghum beer====
In southern [[Africa]], sorghum is used to produce [[beer]], including the local version of [[Guinness]]. In recent years, sorghum has been used as a substitute for other grain in [[gluten-free beer]]. Although the African versions are not "[[gluten]]-free", as malt extract is also used, truly gluten-free beer using such substitutes as sorghum or buckwheat are now available. Sorghum is used in the same way as [[barley]] to produce a "[[malt]]" that can form the basis of a [[Mashing|mash]] that will brew a [[beer]] without [[gliadin]] or [[hordein]] (together "[[gluten]]") and therefore can be suitable for [[coeliac disease|coeliacs]] or others sensitive to certain [[glycoproteins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year= 2006 |url= http://www.glutenfreebeerfestival.com |title= glutenfreebeerfestival.com |publisher= Carolyn Smagalski }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Lakefront brewery milwaukee.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The back of [[Lakefront Brewery, Inc.]] (and Brewers' Point Apartments) in [[Milwaukee]], makers of "New Grist" beer brewed with sorghum and rice.]]
In November 2006, [[Lakefront Brewery, Inc.|Lakefront Brewery]] of [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]], launched its "New Grist" gluten-free beer, brewed with sorghum and [[rice]]. It is one of its most successful lines. It is aimed at those with [[coeliac disease]], although its [[low-carb]] content also makes it popular with health-minded drinkers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work= Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel |year= 2006 |url= http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=451408 |title= JSOnline.com Story on Lake Front Brewery}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2006, [[Anheuser-Busch]] of St. Louis, Missouri, introduced their new "Redbridge" beer. This beer is gluten-free and is produced with sorghum as the main ingredient. Redbridge was the first sorghum-based beer to be nationally distributed in the United States.

African sorghum beer is a brownish-pink beverage with a fruity, sour taste. Its alcohol content can vary between 1% and 8%. African sorghum beer is high in protein, which contributes to [[foam]] stability, giving it a milk-like head. Because this beer is not filtered, its appearance is cloudy and yeasty, and may also contain bits of grain. This beer is said to be very thirst-quenching, even if it is traditionally consumed at room temperature.

African sorghum beer is a popular drink primarily amongst the black community for historical reasons. African sorghum beer is said to be a traditional drink of the [[Zulu people|Zulu]] people of Southern Africa. It also became popular amongst the black community in South Africa, in part because the only exception to the [[prohibition]], which was lifted in 1962 and only applied to black people, was sorghum beer.

Sorghum beer is also associated with the development of the segregationist "[[Durban System]]" in South Africa in the early 20th Century. The turn of the 20th Century saw growing segregationist tendencies amongst the white populations of South African towns. Fearful of the alleged diseases of black residents, the white populations of these towns sought to prevent black Africans from gaining permanent residence in urban areas, and separate them from the white communities. Within this context, two municipalities, Durban and Pietermaritzburg, devised a system by which black Africans in their locality would be housed in 'native locations' outside the main towns, with their segregated accommodation paid for from revenues from the municipal monopoly over sorghum beer. This solved the problem of white rate-payers having to foot the cost of segregation, and ensured the whole scheme paid for itself. After the passage of the [[1923 Natives (Urban Areas) Act]], all municipalities in South Africa were given the powers to enforce racial segregation, and the Durban System was extended throughout the union, ensuring that segregation was paid for from African rents and beerhall monopolies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Worden|first=Nigel|title=The Making of Modern South Africa|year=1996|publisher=Blackwell|location=Oxford|pages=42–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sorghum beer is called ''bjala'' in northern Sotho and is traditionally made to mark the unveiling of a loved-one's tombstone. The task of making the beer falls traditionally to women. The process is begun several days before the party, when the women of the community gather together to bring the sorghum and water to a boil in huge cast iron pots over open fires. After the mix has fermented for several days, it is strained - a somewhat labor-intensive task. Sorghum beer is known by many different names in various countries across Africa, including [[Umqombothi]] (South Africa) ''burukuto'' (Nigeria), ''pombe'' (East Africa) and ''bil-bil'' (Cameroon). African sorghum beer brewed using grain sorghum undergoes [[lactic acid fermentation]], as well as [[alcoholic fermentation]].

The steps in [[brewing]] African sorghum beer are: [[malting]], [[mashing]], souring and [[alcoholic fermentation]]. All steps, with the exception of the souring, can be compared to traditional [[beer]] brewing.

The souring of African sorghum beer by [[lactic acid fermentation]] is responsible for the distinct sour taste. Souring may be initiated using [[yogurt]], [[sour dough]] [[dough starter|starter]] cultures, or by spontaneous fermentation. The natural microflora of the sorghum grain maybe also be the source of lactic acid bacteria; a handful of raw grain sorghum or malted sorghum may be mixed in with the wort to start the lactic acid fermentation. Although many lactic acid bacteria strains may be present, ''[[Lactobacillus]]'' spp. is responsible for the lactic acid fermentation in African sorghum beer.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Walt, H.P., 1956. Kafficorn matling and brewing studies II-Studies on the microbiology of Kaffir Beer. J. Sci. Food. Agric. 7(2) 105–113.&lt;/ref&gt;

Commercial African sorghum beer is packaged in a microbiologically active state. The lactic acid fermentation and/or alcoholic fermentation may still be active. For this reason, special plastic or carton containers with vents are used to allow gas to escape. Spoilage is a big safety concern when it comes to African sorghum beer. Packaging does not occur in sterile conditions and many microorganisms may contaminate the beer. Also, using wild lactic acid bacteria increases the chances of spoilage organisms being present. However, the microbiologically active characteristic of the beer also increases the safety of the product by creating competition between organisms.&lt;ref&gt;Haggblade, S., Holzapfel, W.H., 1989. Industrialization of Africa's indigenous beer brewing. In: Steinkraus K.H. (Ed,), Industrialization of Indigenous Fermented Foods, 33. Marcel/Dekker, New York, pp. 191–283.&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[aflatoxins]] from mould were found on sorghum grain, they were not found in industrially produced African sorghum beer.&lt;ref&gt;Trinder, DW. 1998. A survey of aflatoxins in industrially brewed South African sorghum beer and beer strainings. J. INST. BREW. vol. 95, no. 5, pp. 307–309&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other uses===
Sorghum [[straw]] (stem fibres) can also be made into excellent wallboard for house building, as well as biodegradable packaging. Since it does not accumulate static electricity, it is also used in packaging materials for sensitive electronic equipment.

Little research has been done to improve sorghum [[cultivar]]s{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} because the vast majority of sorghum production is done by subsistence farmers.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} The crop is therefore mostly limited by insects, disease and weeds, rather than by the plant's inherent ability.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} To improve the plant's viability in sustaining populations in drought-prone areas, a larger capital investment would be necessary to control plant pests and ensure optimum planting and harvesting practices.

In November 2005, however, the US Congress passed a Renewable Fuels Standard as part of the [[Energy Policy Act of 2005]], with the goal of producing 30 billion litres (8 billion gallons) of renewable fuel (ethanol) annually by 2012. Currently, 12% of grain sorghum production in the US is used to make ethanol.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

An AP article &lt;ref name=sweetsorghumsaparticle&gt;[http://www.cnsnews.com/ViewNation.asp?Page=/Nation/archive/200805/NAT20080514d.html Sweet Sorghum Sap] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516052819/http://www.cnsnews.com/ViewNation.asp?Page=%2FNation%2Farchive%2F200805%2FNAT20080514d.html |date=May 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; claims that sorghum-sap-based ethanol has four times the energy yield as corn-based ethanol, but is on par with sugarcane. &lt;!---The sap could be used for ethanol while the grain is used for food. except they are different varities and the sap is gone by the time the grain matures---&gt;

Sorghum requires an average temperature of at least 25&amp;nbsp;°C to produce maximum grain yields in a given year. Maximum photosynthesis is achieved at daytime temperatures of at least 30&amp;nbsp;°C. Night time temperatures below 13&amp;nbsp;°C for more than a few days can severely reduce the plants' potential grain production. Sorghum cannot be planted until soil temperatures have reached 17&amp;nbsp;°C. The long growing season, usually 90–120 days, causes yields to be severely decreased if plants are not in the ground early enough.

Grain sorghum is usually planted with a commercial corn seeder at a depth of 2–5&amp;nbsp;cm, depending on the density of the soil (shallower in heavier soil). The goal in planting, when working with fertile soil, is 50,000 to 300,000 plants per hectare. Therefore, with an average emergence rate of 75%, sorghum should be planted at a rate of 2–12&amp;nbsp;kg of seed per hectare.

Yields have been found to be boosted by 10–15% when optimum use of moisture and sunlight are available, by planting in 25&amp;nbsp;cm rows instead of the conventional 1-meter rows.

Sorghum, in general, is a very competitive crop, and does well in competition with weeds in narrow rows. Sorghum produces a chemical compound called [[sorgoleone]], which the plant uses to combat weeds. The chemical is so effective in preventing the growth of weeds it sometime prohibits the growth of other crops harvested on the same field. To address this problem, researchers at the [[Agricultural Research Service]] found two gene sequences believed to be responsible for the enzymes that secrete the chemical compound sorogoleone.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/pr/2010/100615.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery of these gene sequences will help researchers one day in developing sorghum varieties that cause less soil toxicity and potentially target gene sequences in other crops to increase their natural pesticide capabilities, as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/pr/2010/100615.htm |title= Tapping into Sorghum’s Weed Fighting Capabilities to Give Growers More Options |publisher=USDA Agricultural Research Service |date=June 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Insect and diseases are not prevalent in sorghum crops. [[Birds]], however, are a major source of yield loss. Hybrids with higher [[tannin]] content and growing the crop in large field blocks are solutions used to combat the birds. The crop may also be attacked by corn earworms, aphids, and some [[Lepidoptera]] [[larva]]e, including [[Turnip Moth|turnip moths]].

It is a very high [[nitrogen]]-feeding crop. An average hectare producing 6.3 tonnes of grain yield requires 110&amp;nbsp;kg of nitrogen, but relatively small amounts of phosphorus and potassium (15&amp;nbsp;kg of each).

Sorghum’s growth habit is similar to that of maize, but with more side shoots and a more extensively branched root system. The root system is very fibrous, and can extend to a depth of up to 1.2 m. The plant finds 75% of its water in the top metre of soil, and because of this, in dry areas, the plant’s production can be severely affected by the water holding capacity of the soil. The plants require up to 70–100&amp;nbsp;mm of moisture every 10 days in early stages of growth, and as sorghum progresses through growth stages and the roots penetrate more deeply into the soil to tap into hidden water reserves, the plant needs progressively less water. By the time the seed heads are filling, optimum water conditions are down to about 50&amp;nbsp;mm every 10 days. Compacted soil or shallow topsoil can limit the plant's ability to deal with drought by limiting its root system. Since these plants have evolved to grow in hot, dry areas, it is essential to keep the soil from compacting and to grow on land with ample cultivated topsoil.

Wild species of sorghum tend to grow to a height of 1.5–2 m; however, due to problems this height created when the grain was being harvested, in recent years, cultivars with [[genes]] for [[dwarfism]] have been selected, resulting in sorghum that grows to between 60 and 120&amp;nbsp;cm tall.

Sorghum's yields are not affected by short periods of drought as severely as other crops such as maize, because it develops its seed heads over longer periods of time, and short periods of water stress do not usually have the ability to prevent kernel development. Even in a long drought severe enough to hamper sorghum production, it will still usually produce some seed on smaller and fewer seed heads. Rarely will one find a kernelless season for sorghum, even under the most adverse water conditions. Sorghum's ability to thrive with less water than maize may be due to its ability to hold water in its foliage better than maize. Sorghum has a waxy coating on its leaves and stems which helps to keep water in the plant, even in intense heat.

==Nutritional profile==
[[File:Sorghum bicolor03.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Sorghum bicolor]]]]
Sorghum is about 70% starch, so is a good energy source. Its starch consists of 70 to 80% [[amylopectin]], a branched-chain polymer of glucose, and 20 to 30% [[amylose]], a straight-chain polymer.

The digestibility of the sorghum starch is relatively poor in its unprocessed form, varying between 33 and 48%. Processing of the grain by methods such as steaming, [[pressure cooking]], flaking, puffing or micronization of the starch increases the digestibility of sorghum starch. This has been attributed to a release of starch granules from the protein matrix, rendering them more susceptible to enzymatic digestion.

On cooking, the gelatinized starch of sorghum tends to return from the soluble, dispersed and amorphous state to an insoluble crystalline state. This phenomenon is known as [[Retrogradation (starch)|retrogradation]]; it is enhanced with low temperatures and high concentrations of starch. Amylose, the linear component of the starch, is more susceptible to retrogradation.

Certain sorghum varieties contain antinutritional factors such as [[tannin]]s. The presence of tannins is claimed to contribute to the poor digestibility of sorghum starch. Processing in humid thermal environments aids in lowering the antinutritional factors.

Sorghum starch does not contain gluten. This makes it a possible grain for those who are [[Non-celiac gluten sensitivity|gluten sensitive]].&lt;ref name=sorghum1&gt;{{cite web|title=Sorghum Handbook|publisher=U.S. Grains Council|year=2005|url=http://www.agmrc.org/media/cms/Sorghum_Handbook_B5FE1C2B5DBCF.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After starch, proteins are the main constituent of sorghum. The essential amino acid profile of sorghum protein is claimed to depend on the sorghum variety, soil and growing conditions. A wide variation has been reported. For example, lysine content in sorghum has been reported to vary from 71 to 212&amp;nbsp;mg per gram of nitrogen.&lt;ref name=fao1/&gt; Some studies on sorghum's amino acid composition suggest albumin and globulin fractions contained high amounts of lysine and tryptophan and in general were well-balanced in their essential amino acid composition. On the other hand, some studies claim sorghum's prolamin fraction was extremely poor in lysine, arginine, histidine and tryptophan and contained high amounts of proline, glutamic acid and leucine. The digestibility of sorghum protein has also been found to vary between different varieties and source of sorghum, ranging from 30 to 70%.

A World Health Organization report suggests the inherent capacity of the existing sorghum varieties commonly consumed in poor countries was not adequate to meet the growth requirements of infants and young children. The report also claimed sorghum alone may not be able to meet the healthy maintenance requirements in adults. A balanced diet would supplement sorghum with other food staples.

Sorghum's nutritional profile includes several minerals. This mineral matter is unevenly distributed and is more concentrated in the germ and the seed coat. In milled sorghum flours, minerals such as phosphorus, iron, zinc and copper decreased with lower extraction rates. Similarly, pearling the grain to remove the fibrous seed coat resulted in considerable reductions in the mineral contents of sorghum. The presence of antinutrition factors such as tannins in sorghum reduces its mineral availability as food. It is important to process and prepare sorghum properly to improve its nutrition value.

Sorghum is a good source of B-complex vitamins. Some varieties of sorghum contain β-carotene which can be converted to vitamin A by the human body; given the photosensitive nature of carotenes and variability due to environmental factors, scientists claim sorghum is likely to be of little importance as a dietary source of vitamin A precursor. Some fat-soluble vitamins, namely D, E and K, have also been found in sorghum grain in detectable, but insufficient, quantities. Sorghum as it is generally consumed is not a source of vitamin C.

===Comparison of sorghum to other major staple foods===

The following table shows the nutrient content of sorghum and compares it to major staple foods in a raw form. Raw forms of these staples, however, are not edible and cannot be digested. These must be prepared and cooked as appropriate for human consumption. In processed and cooked form, the relative nutritional and antinutritional contents of each of these grains is remarkably different from that of the raw forms reported in this table. The nutrition value for each staple food in cooked form depends on the cooking method (for example: boiling, baking, steaming, frying, etc.).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="768">In biochemistry, the '''''Corey-Pauling rules''''', not to be confused with [[Pauling's rules]], are a set of three basic statements that govern the secondary nature of proteins, in particular, the CO-NH peptide link. They were originally proposed by [[Robert Corey]] and [[Linus Pauling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=A Dictionary of Chemistry| publisher=Oxford University Press| ISBN=9780199204632| year=2008| editor=John Daintith| edition=6th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rules are as follows:
#The atoms in a peptide link all lie on the same plane.
#The nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms in a hydrogen bond are approximately in a straight line.
#The carbon-oxygen and nitrogen-hydrogen groups are all involved in bonding.

[[File:Spinterogeno.JPG|thumb|Typical distributor with distributor cap.&lt;br&gt;Also visible are mounting/drive shaft (bottom), vacuum advance unit (right) and capacitor (centre).]]
[[File:Car ignition system.svg|thumb|Car ignition system. Upper right is Distributor.]]

A '''distributor''' is an enclosed rotating [[Shaft (mechanical engineering)|shaft]] used in [[Spark-ignition engine|spark-ignition]] [[internal combustion engine]]s that have mechanically-timed [[ignition system|ignition]]. The distributor's main function is to route secondary, or high voltage, [[Electric current|current]] from the [[ignition coil]] to the [[spark plug]]s in the correct [[firing order]], and for the correct amount of time. Except in [[Ignition magneto|magneto]] systems, the distributor also houses a mechanical or inductive breaker switch to open and close the ignition coil's primary circuit.

The first reliable battery operated ignition was developed by [[Delco Electronics|Dayton Engineering Laboratories Co.]] (Delco) and introduced in the 1910 Cadillac. This ignition was developed by [[Charles Kettering]] and was considered a wonder in its day. [[A. Atwater Kent|Atwater Kent]] invented his Unisparker ignition system about this time in competition with the Delco system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Cadillac History {{!}} Kanter Car Tales|url = http://kanter-car-tales.com/category/cadillac-history/|website = kanter-car-tales.com|access-date = 2016-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 20th century mechanical ignitions were disappearing from [[automotive]] applications in favor of [[Inductive discharge ignition|inductive]] or [[Capacitor discharge ignition|capacitive]] [[electronic ignition]]s fully controlled by [[engine control unit]]s (ECU), rather than directly timed to the engine's [[crankshaft]] speed.

== Description ==
A distributor consists of a rotating arm or [[wikt:rotor|rotor]] inside the distributor cap, on top of the distributor shaft, but insulated from it and the body of the vehicle ([[Ground (electricity)|ground]]). The distributor shaft is driven by a gear on the [[camshaft]] on most overhead valve engines, and attached directly to a camshaft on most overhead cam engines. (The distributor shaft may also drive the [[Oil pump (internal combustion engine)|oil pump]].) The metal part of the rotor contacts the high voltage cable from the ignition coil via a spring-loaded [[carbon]] [[brush (electric)|brush]] on the underside of the distributor cap. The metal part of the rotor arm passes close to (but does not touch) the output contacts which connect via [[high tension leads]] to the [[spark plug]] of each [[cylinder (engine)|cylinder]]. As the rotor spins within the distributor, electric current is able to jump the small gaps created between the rotor arm and the contacts due to the high voltage created by the ignition coil.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = How the ignition system works|url = http://www.howacarworks.com/basics/how-the-ignition-system-works|website = How a Car Works|access-date = 2016-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The distributor shaft has a [[cam]] that operates the [[contact breaker]] (also called ''points''). Opening the points causes a high [[electromagnetic induction|induction]] voltage in the system's [[ignition coil]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The distributor also houses the [[Centrifugal force|centrifugal]] advance unit: a set of hinged weights attached to the distributor shaft, that cause the breaker points mounting plate to slightly rotate and advance the spark [[Ignition timing|timing]] with higher engine [[revolutions per minute]] (rpm). In addition, the distributor has a [[Ignition timing#Vacuum timing advance|vacuum advance unit]] that advances the timing even further as a function of the vacuum in the [[inlet manifold]]. Usually there is also a [[capacitor]] attached to the distributor. The capacitor is connected [[Series and parallel circuits|parallel]] to the breaker points, to suppress [[Electric arc|sparking]] to prevent excessive wear of the points.

Around the 1970s{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} the primary breaker points were largely replaced with a [[Hall effect sensor]] or optical sensor. As this is a non-contacting device and the ignition coil is controlled by [[solid state electronics]], a great amount of maintenance in point adjustment and replacement was eliminated. This also eliminates any problem with breaker follower or cam wear, and by eliminating a side load it extends distributor shaft [[bearing (mechanical)|bearing]] life. The remaining secondary (high voltage) circuit stayed essentially the same, using an ignition coil and a rotary distributor.

Most distributors used on electronically fuel injected engines lack vacuum and centrifugal advance units. On such distributors, the timing advance is controlled electronically by the engine computer. This allows more accurate control of ignition timing, as well as the ability to alter timing based on factors other than engine speed and manifold vacuum (such as engine temperature). Additionally, eliminating vacuum and centrifugal advance results in a simpler and more reliable distributor.

== Distributor cap ==
The distributor cap is the cover that protects the distributor's internal parts and holds the contacts between internal rotor and the spark plug wires.

The distributor cap has one post for each cylinder, and in points ignition systems there is a central post for the current from the [[ignition coil]] coming into the distributor. There are some exceptions however, as some engines (many [[Alfa Romeo]] cars, some 1980s Nissans) have ''two'' spark plugs per cylinder, so there are two leads coming out of the distributor per cylinder. Another implementation is the [[wasted spark]] system, where a single contact serves two leads, but in that case each lead connects one cylinder. In General Motors [[high energy ignition]] (HEI) systems there is no central post and the ignition coil sits on top of the distributor. Some Toyota and Honda engines also have their coil within the distributor cap. On the inside of the cap there is a terminal that corresponds to each post, and the plug terminals are arranged around the circumference of the cap according to the [[firing order]] in order to send the secondary voltage to the proper spark plug at the right time.

The rotor is attached to the top of the distributor shaft which is driven by the engine's [[camshaft]] and thus synchronized to it. Synchronization to the camshaft is required as the rotor must turn at exactly half the speed of the main [[crankshaft]] in the 4-stroke cycle. Often, the rotor and distributor are attached directly to the end of the one of (or the only) camshaft, at the opposite end to the timing drive belt. This rotor is pressed against a [[carbon]] [[brush (electric)|brush]] on the center terminal of the distributor cap which connects to the ignition coil. The rotor is constructed such that the center tab is electrically connected to its outer edge so the current coming in to the center post travels through the carbon point to the outer edge of the rotor. As the camshaft rotates, the rotor spins and its outer edge passes each of the internal plug terminals to fire each spark plug in sequence.

Engines that use a mechanical distributor may fail if they run into deep puddles because any water that gets onto the distributor can short out the electric current that should go through the spark plugs, rerouting it directly to the body of the vehicle. This in turn causes the engine to stop as the fuel is not ignited in the cylinders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Misfire from driving through "wave of water" likely result of wet distributor cap — a problem that’s not costly to fix|url = http://www.postandcourier.com/article/20150328/PC2107/150329330/misfire-from-driving-through-x201c-wave-of-water-x201d-likely-result-of-wet-distributor-cap-x2014-a-problem-that-x2019-s-not-costly-to-fix|website = Post and Courier|access-date = 2016-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This problem can be fixed by removing the distributor's cap and drying the cap, cam, rotor and the contacts by wiping with tissue paper or a clean rag, by blowing hot air on them, or using a moisture displacement spray e.g. [[WD-40]] or similar. Oil, dirt or other contaminants can cause similar problems, so the distributor should be kept clean inside and outside to ensure reliable operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title = Cleaning distributor cap|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mm6nsETfUxw|date = 2014-03-23|accessdate = 2016-02-12|last = mitmaks}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some engines include a rubber o-ring or gasket between the distributor base and cap to help prevent this problem. The gasket is made of a material like Viton or butyl for a tight seal in extreme temperatures and chemical environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Rubber Gaskets and Soft Gaskets - Mercer Gasket &amp; Shim|url = http://www.mercergasket.com/rubber.htm|website = Mercer Gasket &amp; Shim|access-date = 2016-02-12|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This gasket should not be discarded when replacing the cap. Most distributor caps have the position of the number 1 cylinder's terminal molded into the plastic. By referencing a [[firing order]] diagram and knowing the direction the rotor turns, (which can be seen by cranking the engine with the cap off) the spark plug wires can be correctly routed. Most distributor caps are designed so that they cannot be installed in the wrong position. Some older engine designs allow the cap to be installed in the wrong position by 180 degrees, however. The number 1 cylinder position on the cap should be noted before a cap is replaced.

The distributor cap is a prime example of a component that eventually succumbs to heat and vibration. It is a relatively easy and inexpensive part to replace if its [[bakelite]] housing does not break or crack first. Carbon deposit accumulation or erosion of its metal terminals may also cause distributor-cap failure.

As it is generally easy to remove and carry off, the distributor cap can be taken off as a means of theft prevention. Although not practical for everyday use, because it is essential for the starting and running of the engine, its removal thwarts any attempt at [[hot-wiring]] the vehicle.

== Direct and distributorless ignition ==
Modern engine designs have abandoned the high-voltage distributor and coil, instead performing the distribution function in the primary circuit electronically and applying the primary (low-voltage) pulse to individual coils for each spark plug, or one coil for each pair of companion cylinders in an engine (two coils for a four-cylinder, three coils for a six-cylinder, four coils for an eight-cylinder, and so on).

In traditional remote distributorless systems, the coils are mounted together in a [[transformer oil]] filled 'coil pack', or separate coils for each cylinder, which are secured in a specified place in the engine compartment with wires to the spark plugs, similar to a distributor setup. [[General Motors]], [[Ford]], [[Chrysler]], [[Hyundai]], [[Subaru]], [[Volkswagen]] and [[Toyota]] are among the automobile manufacturers known to have used coil packs. Coil packs by Delco for use with [[General Motors]] engines allow removal of the individual coils in case one should fail, but in most other remote distributorless coil pack setups, if a coil were to fail, replacement of the whole pack would be required to fix the problem.

More recent layouts utilize a coil located very near to (''Coil-Near-Plugs'') or directly on top of each spark plug ('''Direct Ignition''', ''DI'', ''coil-on-plug'', or ''COP''). This design avoids the need to transmit very high voltages, which is often a source of trouble, especially in damp conditions.

Both direct and remote distributorless systems also allow finer levels of ignition control by the engine computer, which helps to increase power output, decrease fuel consumption and emissions, and implement features such as [[variable displacement|cylinder deactivation]]. [[High tension leads|Spark plug wires]], which need routine replacement due to wear, are also eliminated when the individual coils are mounted directly on top of each plug, since the power is transported a very short distance from the coil to the plug.

===Wasted spark===
{{main|Wasted spark}}
Four-stroke 2-cylinder engines can be built without a distributor, as in the [[Citroen 2CV]] of 1948 and BMW boxer twin motorcycles, and some Honda motorcycles from the 1960s (e.g. the CL160 Scrambler). Both spark plugs of the boxer twin are fired simultaneously, resulting in a wasted spark on the cylinder currently on its exhaust stroke.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Citroen 2CV Special (1979)|url = http://www.netcarshow.com/citroen/1979-2cv_spcial/|website = NetCarShow.com|access-date = 2016-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four-stroke 4-cylinder engines can be built without a distributor, as in the [[Citroen ID19]]. Two coils are used with one coil firing two of the spark plugs simultaneously, resulting in a wasted spark on the cylinder currently on its exhaust stroke, and the other coil used for the other two cylinders. This system has been scaled up to engines with virtually an unlimited number of cylinders.

Four-stroke one-cylinder engines can be built without a distributor, as in many lawn mowers. The spark plug is fired on every stroke, resulting in a wasted spark in the cylinder when on its exhaust stroke.

 {{Refimprove|date=November 2016}}
{{Electrical Wiring Sidebar}}
In an electrical installation, an '''earthing system''' or '''grounding system''' connects specific parts of that installation with the Earth's conductive surface for safety and functional purposes.  The point of reference is the Earth's conductive surface. The choice of earthing system can affect the [[safety]] and [[electromagnetic compatibility]] of the installation. Regulations for earthing systems vary considerably among countries, though many follow the recommendations of the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]]. Regulations may identify special cases for earthing in mines, in patient care areas, or in hazardous areas of industrial plants. 

In addition to electric power systems, other systems may require grounding for safety or function.  Tall structures may have [[lightning rod]]s as part of a system to protect them from lightning strikes.  [[Electrical telegraph|Telegraph lines]] may use the Earth as one conductor of a circuit, saving the cost of installation of a return wire over a long circuit. [[Radio antenna]]s may require particular grounding for operation, as well as to control static electricity and provide lightning protection.

==Objectives of electrical earthing==

===Protective earthing===

An earth ground connection of the exposed conductive parts of electrical equipment helps protect from electric shock by keeping the exposed conductive surface of connected devices close to earth potential, when a failure of electrical insulation occurs.  When a fault occurs, current flows from the power system to earth. The current may be high enough to operate the over current protection [[Fuse (electrical)|fuse]] or [[circuit breaker]], which will then interrupt the circuit. To ensure the voltage on exposed surfaces is not too high, the impedance (resistance) of the connection to earth must be kept low relative to the normal circuit impedance.  

An alternative to protective earthing of exposed surfaces is a design with "double insulation" or other precautions, such that a single failure or highly probable combination of failures cannot result in contact between live circuits and the surface.  For example, a hand-held power tool might have an extra system of electrical insulation between internal components and the case of the tool, so that even if the insulation for the motor or switch fails, the tool case is not energized.

===Functional earthing===
A ''functional earth'' connection serves a purpose other than electrical safety, and may carry current as part of normal operation.&lt;ref name="BS7671:2008. Part 2 - definitions"&gt;BS7671:2008. Part 2 – definitions.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, in a [[single-wire earth return]] power distribution system, the earth forms one conductor of the circuit and carries all the load current.  Other examples of devices that use functional earth connections include [[surge suppression|surge suppressors]] and [[electromagnetic interference]] filters.

==Low-voltage systems==
In [[low-voltage network]]s, which distribute the electric power to the widest class of end users, the main concern for design of earthing systems is safety of consumers who use the electric appliances and their protection against electric shocks. The earthing system, in combination with protective devices such as fuses and residual current devices, must ultimately ensure that a person must not come into touch with a metallic object whose potential relative to the person's potential exceeds a "safe" threshold, typically set at about 50&amp;nbsp;V.

On electricity networks with a system voltage of 240&amp;nbsp;V to 1.1&amp;nbsp;kV, which are mostly used in industrial / mining equipment / machines rather than publicly accessible networks, the earthing system design is as equally important from safety point of view as for domestic users.
 
In most developed countries, 220&amp;nbsp;V, 230&amp;nbsp;V, or 240&amp;nbsp;V sockets with earthed contacts were introduced either just before or soon after World War II, though with considerable national variation in popularity. In the United States and Canada, 120&amp;nbsp;V power outlets installed before the mid-1960s generally did not include a ground (earth) pin.  In the developing world, local wiring practice may not provide a connection to an earthing pin of an outlet. 
 
For a time, US National Electrical Code allowed certain major appliances permanently connected to the supply to use the supply neutral wire as the equipment enclosure connection to ground. This was not permitted for plug-in equipment as the neutral and energized conductor could easily be accidentally exchanged, creating a severe hazard. If the neutral was interrupted, the equipment enclosure would no longer be connected to ground.  Normal imbalances  in a [[split phase]] distribution system could create objectionable neutral to ground voltages.  Recent editions of the NEC no longer permit this practice.  For these reasons, most countries have now mandated dedicated protective earth connections that are now almost universal.

If the fault path between accidentally energized objects and the supply connection has low impedance, the fault current will be so large that the circuit overcurrent protection device (fuse or circuit breaker) will open to clear the ground fault. Where the earthing system does not provide a low-impedance metallic conductor between equipment enclosures and supply return (such as in a TT separately earthed system), fault currents are smaller, and will not necessarily operate the overcurrent protection device. In such case a [[Residual-current device|residual current detector]] is installed to detect the current leaking to ground and interrupt the circuit.

===IEC terminology===
[[International standard]] [[IEC 60364]] distinguishes three families of earthing arrangements, using the two-letter codes '''TN''', '''TT''', and '''IT'''.

The first letter indicates the connection between [[Ground (electricity)|earth]] and the power-supply equipment (generator or transformer):

:'''"T"''' — Direct connection of a point with earth (Latin: Terra)
:'''"I"''' — No point is connected with earth (isolation), except perhaps via a high impedance.

The second letter indicates the connection between earth or network and the electrical device being supplied:

:'''"T"''' — Earth connection is by a local direct connection to earth (Latin: terra), usually via a ground rod.
:'''"N"''' — Earth connection is supplied by the electricity supply '''N'''etwork, either as a separate protective earth (PE) conductor or combined with the neutral (PEN) conductor.

====Types of TN networks====
In a '''TN''' earthing system, one of the points in the [[Electrical generator|generator]] or [[transformer]] is connected with earth, usually the star point in a three-phase system. The body of the electrical device is connected with earth via this earth connection at the transformer.
This arrangement is a current standard for residential and industrial electric systems particularly in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Cahier Technique Merlin Gerin n° 173 / p.9|http://www.schneider-electric.com/en/download/document/ECT173/&lt;/ref&gt;

The conductor that connects the exposed metallic parts of the consumer's electrical installation is called
''protective earth'' (''PE''; see also: [[Ground (electricity)|Ground]]). The conductor that connects to the star point in a [[three-phase]] system, or that carries the return current in a [[single-phase]] system, is called ''neutral'' (''N''). Three variants of TN systems are distinguished:
;TN−S: PE and N are separate conductors that are connected together only near the power source.  
;TN−C: A combined PEN conductor fulfils the functions of both a PE and an N conductor. (on 230/400v systems normally only used for distribution networks)
;{{vanchor|TN−C−S}}: Part of the system uses a combined PEN conductor, which is at some point split up into separate PE and N lines. The combined PEN conductor typically occurs between the substation and the entry point into the building, and earth and neutral are separated in the service head.  In the UK, this system is also known as ''protective multiple earthing (PME)'', because of the practice of connecting the combined neutral-and-earth conductor via the shortest practicable route to a local Earth-Rod at the source and at each premises, to provide both System Earthing and Equipment Earthing at each of these locations.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scribd.com/doc/31741300/Industrial-Power-Systems-Handbook-Donald-Beeman Chapter 5.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpgAVE4UwFw&amp;t=1351s|title=Grounding - Safety Fundamentals (1hr:13min:19sec)|first=|last=MikeHoltNEC|date=14 November 2013|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Similar systems in Australia and New Zealand are designated as ''multiple earthed neutral (MEN)'' and, in North America, as ''multi-grounded neutral (MGN)''.

It is possible to have both TN-S and TN-C-S supplies taken from the same transformer. For example, the sheaths on some underground cables corrode and stop providing good earth connections, and so homes where high resistance "bad earths" are found may be converted to TN-C-S. This is only possible on a network when the neutral is suitably robust against failure, and conversion is not always possible. The PEN must be suitable reinforced against failure, as an open circuit PEN can impress full phase voltage on any exposed metal connected to the system earth downstream of the break. The alternative is to provide a local  earth and convert to TT.
The main attraction of a TN network is the low impedance earth path allows easy automatic disconnection (ADS) on a high current circuit in the case of a line-to-PE short circuit as the same breaker or fuse will operate for either L-N or L-PE faults, and an RCD is not needed to detect earth faults.

====TT network====
In a '''TT''' (Terra-Terra) earthing system, the protective earth connection for the consumer is provided by a local earth electrode, (sometimes referred to as the Terra-Firma connection) and there is another independently installed at the generator. There is no 'earth wire' between the two.
The fault loop impedance is higher, and unless the electrode impedance is very low indeed, a TT installation should always have an RCD (GFCI) as its first isolator.

The big advantage of the TT earthing system is the reduced conducted interference from other users' connected equipment. TT has always been preferable for special applications like telecommunication sites that benefit from the interference-free earthing. Also, TT networks do not pose any serious risks in the case of a broken neutral. In addition, in locations where power is distributed overhead, earth conductors are not at risk of becoming live should any overhead distribution conductor be fractured by, say, a fallen tree or branch.

In pre-[[Residual-current device|RCD]] era, the TT earthing system was unattractive for general use because of the difficulty of arranging reliable automatic disconnection (ADS) in the case of a line-to-PE short circuit (in comparison with TN systems, where the same breaker or fuse will operate for either L-N or L-PE faults). But as [[Residual-current device|residual current devices]] mitigate this disadvantage, the TT earthing system has become much more attractive providing that all AC power circuits are RCD-protected. In some countries (such as the UK) is recommended for situations where a low impedance equipotential zone is impractical to maintain by bonding, where there is significant outdoor wiring, such as supplies to mobile homes and some agricultural settings, or where a high fault current could pose other dangers, such as at fuel depots or marinas.

The TT earthing system is used throughout Japan, with RCD units in most industrial settings.  This can impose added requirements on [[variable frequency drive]]s and [[switched-mode power supplies]] which often have substantial filters passing high frequency noise to the ground conductor.

[[File:TT-earthing.svg|350px]]

====IT network====
In an '''IT''' network, the electrical distribution system has no connection to earth at all, or it has only a high [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] connection.

===Other terminologies===
While the national wiring regulations for buildings of many countries follow the [[IEC 60364]] terminology, in North America (United States and Canada), the term "equipment grounding conductor" refers to equipment grounds and ground wires on branch circuits, and "grounding electrode conductor" is used for conductors bonding an earth ground rod (or similar) to a service panel. "Grounded conductor" is the system "neutral".
Australian and New Zealand standards use a modified PME earthing system called Multiple Earthed Neutral (MEN). The neutral is grounded (earthed) at each consumer service point thereby effectively bringing the neutral potential difference to zero along the whole length of LV lines.
In the UK and some Commonwealth countries, the term "PNE", meaning Phase-Neutral-Earth is used to indicate that three (or more for non-single-phase connections) conductors are used, i.e., PN-S.

===Resistance-earthed neutral (India)===
A resistance earth system is used for mining in India as per [[Central Electricity Authority Regulations]]. Instead of a solid connection of neutral to earth,  a neutral grounding resistor ([[Electrical resistance and conductance#Neutral grounding resistance|NGR]]) is used to limit the current to ground to less than a750&amp;nbsp;mA. Due to  the fault current restriction it is more safe for gassy mines.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://as1.ori.nic.in/eicelectricity/ECNotification/Safety%20Regulation%20English.pdf]; Central Electricity Authority-(Measures relating to Safety and Electric Supply). Regulations, 2010; earthing system, rule 99 and protective devices, rule 100.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the earth leakage is restricted, leakage protection devices can be set to less than 750&amp;nbsp;mA . By comparison, in a  solidly earthed system, earth fault current can be as much as the available short-circuit current. 

The neutral earthing resistor is monitored to detect an interrupted ground connection and to shut off power if a fault is detected. .&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wmea.net/Technical%20Papers/The%20Importance%20of%20the%20Neutral%20Grounding%20Resistor%20-%20Nov%2006.pdf], The Importance of the Neutral-Grounding Resistor&lt;/ref&gt;

===Earth leakage protection===
To avoid accidental shock, earth leakage relay/sensor are used at the source to isolate the power when leakage exceed certain limit. [[Earth leakage circuit breaker]]s are used for the purpose. Current sensing breaker are called RCB/ RCCB.  In industrial applications, earth leakage relays are used with separate core balanced current transformers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=oOUuBAAAQBAJ]; Electrical Notes, Volume 1, By Sir Arthur Schuster, p.317&lt;/ref&gt; This protection works in the range of milli-Amps and can be set from 30&amp;nbsp;mA to 3000&amp;nbsp;mA.

===Earth connectivity check===
A separate pilot wire is run from distribution/ equipment supply system in addition to earth wire, to supervise the continuity of the wire.  This is used in the trailing cables of mining machinery.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/s?search-alias=stripbooks&amp;field-isbn=9781483102634|title= Electrical Engineer's Reference Book|first1= M A|last1= Laughton|first2= M G |last2=Say|publisher=Elsevier|date=2013|isbn=9781483102634|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--p.32/18 mining--&gt; If the earth wire is broken, the pilot wire allows a sensing device at the source end to interrupt power to the machine. This type of circuit is a must for portable heavy electric equipment (like [[LHD (Load, Haul, Dump machine)]]) being used in under ground mines.

===Properties===
====Cost====
* TN networks save the cost of a low-impedance earth connection at the site of each consumer. Such a connection (a buried metal structure) is required to provide ''protective earth'' in IT and TT systems.
* TN-C networks save the cost of an additional conductor needed for separate N and PE connections. However, to mitigate the risk of broken neutrals, special cable types and lots of connections to earth are needed.
* TT networks require proper [[residual current device|RCD]] (Ground fault interrupter) protection.

====Safety====
* In TN, an insulation fault is very likely to lead to a high short-circuit current that will trigger an overcurrent circuit-breaker or fuse and disconnect the L conductors. With TT systems, the earth fault loop impedance can be too high to do this, or too high to do it within the required time, so an RCD (formerly ELCB) is usually employed. Earlier TT installations may lack this important safety feature, allowing the CPC (Circuit Protective Conductor or PE) and perhaps associated metallic parts within reach of persons (exposed-conductive-parts and extraneous-conductive-parts) to become energized for extended periods under fault conditions, which is a real danger.
* In TN-S and TT systems (and in TN-C-S beyond the point of the split), a residual-current device can be used for additional protection. In the absence of any insulation fault in the consumer device, the equation ''I''&lt;sub&gt;L1&lt;/sub&gt;+''I''&lt;sub&gt;L2&lt;/sub&gt;+''I''&lt;sub&gt;L3&lt;/sub&gt;+''I''&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 holds, and an RCD can disconnect the supply as soon as this sum reaches a threshold (typically 10&amp;nbsp;mA – 500&amp;nbsp;mA). An insulation fault between either L or N and PE will trigger an RCD with high probability.
* In IT and TN-C networks, residual current devices are far less likely to detect an insulation fault. In a TN-C system, they would also be very vulnerable to unwanted triggering from contact between earth conductors of circuits on different RCDs or with real ground, thus making their use impracticable. Also, RCDs usually isolate the neutral core. Since it is unsafe to do this in a TN-C system, RCDs on TN-C should be wired to only interrupt the line conductor.
* In single-ended single-phase systems where the Earth and neutral are combined (TN-C, and the part of TN-C-S systems which uses a combined neutral and earth core), if there is a contact problem in the PEN conductor, then all parts of the earthing system beyond the break will rise to the potential of the L conductor. In an unbalanced multi-phase system, the potential of the earthing system will move towards that of the most loaded line conductor. Such a rise in the potential of the neutral beyond the break is known as a ''neutral inversion''.&lt;ref&gt;Gates, B.G. (1936). [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/login.jsp?url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fiel5%2F5308791%2F5317038%2F05317048.pdf%3Farnumber%3D5317048&amp;authDecision=-203 Neutral inversion in power systems]. In ''Journal of the Institution of Electrical Engineers'' '''78''' (471): 317–325.  Retrieved 2012-03-20.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, TN-C connections must not go across plug/socket connections or flexible cables, where there is a higher probability of contact problems than with fixed wiring. There is also a risk if a cable is damaged, which can be mitigated by the use of [[concentric cable]] construction and multiple earth electrodes. Due to the (small) risks of the lost neutral raising 'earthed' metal work to a dangerous potential, coupled with the increased shock risk from proximity to good contact with true earth, the use of TN-C-S supplies is banned in the UK for caravan sites and shore supply to boats, and strongly discouraged for use on farms and outdoor building  sites, and in such cases it is  recommended to make all outdoor wiring TT with RCD and a separate earth electrode.
* In IT systems, a single insulation fault is unlikely to cause dangerous currents to flow through a human body in contact with earth, because no low-impedance circuit exists for such a current to flow. However, a first insulation fault can effectively turn an IT system into a TN system, and then a second insulation fault can lead to dangerous body currents. Worse, in a multi-phase system, if one of the line conductors made contact with earth, it would cause the other phase cores to rise to the phase-phase voltage relative to earth rather than the phase-neutral voltage. IT systems also experience larger transient overvoltages than other systems.
* In TN-C and TN-C-S systems, any connection between the combined neutral-and-earth core and the body of the earth could end up carrying significant current under normal conditions, and could carry even more under a broken neutral situation. Therefore, main equipotential bonding conductors must be sized with this in mind; use of TN-C-S is inadvisable in situations such as petrol stations, where there is a combination of lots of buried metalwork and explosive gases.

====Electromagnetic compatibility====
* In TN-S and TT systems, the consumer has a low-noise connection to earth, which does not suffer from the voltage that appears on the N conductor as a result of the return currents and the impedance of that conductor. This is of particular importance with some types of telecommunication and measurement equipment.
* In TT systems, each consumer has its own connection to earth, and will not notice any currents that may be caused by other consumers on a shared PE line.

===Regulations===
* In the United States [[National Electrical Code (US)|National Electrical Code]]  and [[Canadian Electrical Code]] the feed from the distribution transformer uses a combined neutral and grounding conductor, but within the structure separate neutral and protective earth conductors are used (TN-C-S). The neutral must be connected to earth only on the supply side of the customer's disconnecting switch.
* In [[Argentina]], [[France]] (TT) and [[Australia]] (TN-C-S), the customers must provide their own ground connections.
* Japan is governed by [[PSE law]], and uses TT earthing in most installations.
* In Australia, the Multiple Earthed Neutral (MEN) earthing system is used and is described in Section 5 of AS 3000. For an LV customer, it is a TN-C system from the transformer in the street to the premises, (the neutral is earthed multiple times along this segment), and a TN-S system inside the installation, from the Main Switchboard downwards. Looked at as a whole, it is a TN-C-S system.
* In [[Denmark]] the high voltage regulation (Stærkstrømsbekendtgørelsen) and [[Malaysia]] the Electricity Ordinance 1994 states that all consumers must use TT earthing, though in rare cases TN-C-S may be allowed (used in the same manner as in the United States). Rules are different when it comes to larger companies.
* In [[India]] as per [[Central Electricity Authority Regulations]], CEAR, 2010, rule 41, there is provision of  earthing,  neutral wire of a 3-phase, 4-wire system and the additional third wire of a 2- phase, 3-wire system. Earthing is to be done with two separate connections.  Grounding system also to have minimum two or more earth pits (electrode) such that proper grounding takes place. As per the rule 42, installation with  load above 5&amp;nbsp;kW exceeding 250&amp;nbsp;V shall have suitable Earth leakage protective device to isolate the load in case of earth fault or leakage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://as1.ori.nic.in/eicelectricity/ECNotification/Safety%20Regulation%20English.pdf]; Central Electricity Authority-(Measures relating to Safety and Electric Supply). Regulations, 2010; rule 41 and 42&lt;/ref&gt;

===Application examples===
* In the areas of UK where underground power cabling is prevalent, the TN-S system is common.&lt;ref name="Linsley2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Trevor Linsley|title=Basic Electrical Installation Work|year=2011|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-42748-0|page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[India]] LT supply is generally through TN-S system. Neutral is double grounded at distribution transformer. Neutral and earth run separately on distribution overhead line/cables. Separate conductor for overhead lines and armoring of cables are used for earth connection. Additional earth electrodes/pits are installed at user ends for strengthening earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Indian Standard 3043 Code of practice for electrical wiring installations |url=http://www.bis.org.in/sf/etd/ETD20(10375)_21062016.pdf|publisher=Bureau of Indian Standards|accessdate=30 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Most modern homes in Europe have a TN-C-S earthing system.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} The combined neutral and earth occurs between the nearest transformer substation and the service cut out (the fuse before the meter). After this, separate earth and neutral cores are used in all the internal wiring.
* Older urban and suburban homes in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] tend to have TN-S supplies, with the earth connection delivered through the lead sheath of the underground lead-and-paper cable.
* Older homes in [[Norway]] uses the IT system while newer homes use TN-C-S.
* Some older homes, especially those built before the invention of residual-current circuit breakers and wired home area networks, use an in-house TN-C arrangement. This is no longer recommended practice.
* Laboratory rooms, medical facilities, construction sites, repair workshops, mobile electrical installations, and other environments that are supplied via [[Electrical generator#Engine-generator|engine-generator]]s where there is an increased risk of insulation faults, often use an IT earthing arrangement supplied from [[isolation transformer]]s. To mitigate the two-fault issues with IT systems, the isolation transformers should supply only a small number of loads each and should be protected with an [[insulation monitoring device]] (generally used only by medical, railway or military IT systems, because of cost).
* In remote areas, where the cost of an additional PE conductor outweighs the cost of a local earth connection, TT networks are commonly used in some countries, especially in older properties or in rural areas, where safety might otherwise be threatened by the fracture of an overhead PE conductor by, say, a fallen tree branch. TT supplies to individual properties are also seen in mostly TN-C-S systems where an individual property is considered unsuitable for TN-C-S supply.
* In [[Australia]], New Zealand and [[Israel]] the TN-C-S system is in use; however, the wiring rules state that, in addition, each customer must provide a separate connection to earth, via a dedicated Earth electrode. (Any metallic water pipes entering the consumer's premises must also be "bonded" to the Earthing point at the distribution panel.)  In Australia and New Zealand this is called the Multiple Earthed Neutral Link or MEN Link. This MEN Link is removable for installation testing purposes, but is connected during use by either a locking system (locknuts for instance) or two or more screws. In the MEN system, the integrity of the Neutral is paramount. In Australia, new installations must also bond the foundation concrete re-enforcing under wet areas to the earth conductor (AS3000), typically increasing the size of the earthing, and provides an equipotential plane in areas such as bathrooms.  In older installations, it is not uncommon to find only the water pipe bond, and it is allowed to remain as such, but the additional earth electrode must be installed if any upgrade work is done.  The protective earth and neutral conductors are combined until the consumer's neutral link (located on the customer's side of the electricity meter's neutral connection) – beyond this point, the protective earth and neutral conductors are separate.

==High-voltage systems==
{{expand section|date=October 2013}}
In high-voltage networks (above 1&amp;nbsp;kV), which are far less accessible to the general public, the focus of earthing system design is less on safety and more on reliability of supply, reliability of protection, and impact on the equipment in presence of a short circuit. Only the magnitude of phase-to-ground short circuits, which are the most common, is significantly affected with the choice of earthing system, as the current path is mostly closed through the earth. Three-phase HV/MV [[power transformer]]s, located in distribution [[electrical substation|substation]]s, are the most common source of supply for distribution networks, and type of grounding of their neutral determines the earthing system.

There are five types of neutral earthing:&lt;ref name=EEP1&gt;{{citation|url=http://electrical-engineering-portal.com/types-of-neutral-earthing-in-power-distribution-part-1 |title=Types of neutral earthing in power distribution (part 1) |publisher=EEP – Electrical Engineering Portal |last=Parmar |first=Jignesh}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Solid-earthed neutral
*Unearthed neutral
*Resistance-earthed neutral
**Low-resistance earthing
**High-resistance earthing
*Reactance-earthed neutral 
*Using [[earthing transformer]]s (such as the [[Zigzag transformer]])

===Solid-earthed neutral===
In ''solid'' or ''directly'' earthed neutral, transformer's star point is directly connected to the ground. In this solution, a low-impedance path is provided for the ground fault current to close and, as result, their magnitudes are comparable with three-phase fault currents.&lt;ref name=EEP1/&gt; Since the neutral remains at the potential close to the ground, voltages in unaffected phases remain at levels similar to the pre-fault ones; for that reason, this system is regularly used in [[high-voltage]] [[Electric power transmission|transmission networks]], where insulation costs are high.&lt;ref name=Guldbrand/&gt;

===Resistance-earthed neutral===
To limit short circuit earth fault an additional neutral earthing resistor (NER) is added between the neutral of transformer's star point and earth.

====Low-resistance earthing====
With low resistance fault current limit is relatively high. In [[India]] it is restricted for 50 A for open cast mines as per [[Central Electricity Authority Regulations]], CEAR, 2010, rule 100.

====High-resistance earthing==== 
High resistance grounding system grounds the neutral through a resistance which limits the ground fault current to a value equal to or slightly greater than the capacitive charging current of that system

===Unearthed neutral===
In ''unearthed'', ''isolated'' or ''floating neutral'' system, as in the IT system, there is no direct connection of the star point (or any other point in the network) and the ground. As a result, ground fault currents have no path to be closed and thus have negligible magnitudes. However, in practice, the fault current will not be equal to zero: conductors in the circuit — particularly underground cables — have an inherent [[capacitance]] towards the earth, which provides a path of relatively high impedance.&lt;ref name=EPS&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lrQJ_kzGapUC&amp;pg=PA488 |title=Electrical Power Systems: Theory and Practice |last=Bandyopadhyay |first=M. N. |chapter=21. Neutral earthing |publisher=PHI Learning Pvt. Ltd. |year=2006 |pages=488–491}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Systems with isolated neutral may continue operation and provide uninterrupted supply even in presence of a ground fault.&lt;ref name=EEP1/&gt; However, while the fault is present, the potential of other two phases relative to the ground reaches &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{3}&lt;/math&gt; of the normal operating voltage, creating additional stress for the [[Insulator (electrical)|insulation]]; insulation failures may inflict additional ground faults in the system, now with much higher currents.&lt;ref name=Guldbrand&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.iea.lth.se/publications/Reports/LTH-IEA-7216.pdf |title=System earthing |publisher=Industrial Electrical Engineering and Automation, Lund University |year=2006 |last=Guldbrand |first=Anna}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Presence of uninterrupted ground fault may pose a significant safety risk: if the current exceeds 4&amp;nbsp;A – 5&amp;nbsp;A an [[electric arc]] develops, which may be sustained even after the fault is cleared.&lt;ref name=EPS/&gt; For that reason, they are chiefly limited to underground and submarine networks, and industrial applications, where the reliability need is high and probability of human contact relatively low. In urban distribution networks with multiple underground feeders, the capacitive current may reach several tens of amperes, posing significant risk for the equipment.

The benefit of low fault current and continued system operation thereafter is offset by inherent drawback that the fault location is hard to detect.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Methods for detecting ground faults in medium-voltage distribution power systems |url=https://www.selinc.com/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=2385 |last1=Fischer |first1=Normann |last2=Hou |first2=Daqing |publisher=Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories, Inc. |page=15 |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Electrolysis of water''' is the [[Water splitting|decomposition of water]]  into [[oxygen]]  and [[hydrogen]] gas due to the passage of an [[electricity|electric current]]. The reaction has a standard potential of −1.23 V, meaning it ideally requires a potential difference of 1.23 volts to split water.

This technique can be used to make (hydrogen gas) and breathable oxygen. As hydrogen is an important industrial commodity, by far most industrial methods produce hydrogen from [[natural gas]] instead, in the [[Steam reforming]] process.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1800 [[Alessandro Volta]] invented the [[voltaic pile]], and a few weeks later [[William Nicholson (chemist)|William Nicholson]] and [[Anthony Carlisle]] used it for the electrolysis of water. When [[Zénobe Gramme]] invented the [[Gramme machine]] in 1869 electrolysis of water became a cheap method for the production of hydrogen. A method of industrial synthesis of hydrogen and oxygen through electrolysis was developed by [[Dmitry Lachinov]] in 1888.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.megabook.ru/Article.asp?AID=645734 Lachinov Dmitry Aleksandrovich] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726201906/http://www.megabook.ru/Article.asp?AID=645734 |date=26 July 2011 }} at Great [[Saints Cyrill and Methodius|Cyrill and Methodius]] Encyclopedia {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principle==
A DC electrical power source is connected to two [[electrode]]s, or two plates (typically made from some inert metal such as [[platinum]], [[stainless steel]] or [[iridium]]) which are placed in the water. Hydrogen will appear at the [[cathode]] (where [[electron]]s enter the water), and oxygen will appear at the [[anode]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Chemistry|last=Zumdahl|first=Steven S.|last2=Zumdahl|first2=Susan A.|date=2013-01-01|publisher=[[Cengage Learning]]|year=|edition=9th|location=|page=866|isbn=978-1-13-361109-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assuming ideal [[faradaic efficiency]], the [[Amount of substance|amount]] of hydrogen generated is twice the amount of oxygen, and both are [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the total [[electrical charge]] conducted by the solution.&lt;ref name="carmo2013a"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carmo|first=M|author2=Fritz D |author3=Mergel J |author4=Stolten D |title=A comprehensive review on PEM water electrolysis|journal=Journal of Hydrogen Energy|volume=38|issue=12|pages=4901–4934|year=2013|doi=10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.01.151|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.01.151}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in many cells [[electrolysis#Competing half-reactions in solution electrolysis|competing side reactions]] occur, resulting in different products and less than ideal faradaic efficiency.

[[Electrolysis]] of ''pure'' water requires excess energy in the form of [[overpotential]] to overcome various activation barriers. Without the excess energy the electrolysis of ''pure'' water occurs very slowly or not at all. This is in part due to the limited [[self-ionization of water]]. Pure water has an [[electrical conductivity]] about one millionth that of seawater. Many [[electrolytic cell]]s may also lack the requisite [[electrocatalyst]]s. The efficiency of electrolysis is increased through the addition of an [[electrolyte]] (such as a [[Salt (chemistry)|salt]], an [[acid]] or a [[base (chemistry)|base]]) and the use of [[electrocatalyst]]s.

Currently the [[electrolysis|electrolytic process]] is rarely used in industrial applications since hydrogen can currently be produced more affordably from [[fossil fuel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | year=2007 | url=http://www.fsec.ucf.edu/en/consumer/hydrogen/basics/production.htm | title=Hydrogen Basics&amp;nbsp;— Production | publisher=Florida Solar Energy Center | accessdate=5 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Equations==
[[File:Electrolysis of Water.png|thumb|300px|Diagram showing the overall [[chemical equation]].]]

In pure water at the negatively charged cathode, a [[redox|reduction]] reaction takes place, with electrons (e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) from the cathode being given to hydrogen cations to form hydrogen gas. The [[half reaction]], balanced with acid, is:

:Reduction at cathode: 2 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(''[[Aqueous solution|aq]]'') + 2e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''[[gaseous|g]]'')

At the positively charged anode, an [[redox|oxidation]] reaction occurs, generating oxygen gas and giving electrons to the anode to complete the circuit:

:Oxidation at anode: 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(''[[liquid|l]]'') → O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''g'') + 4 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(''aq'') + 4e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

The same half reactions can also be balanced with base as listed below. Not all half reactions must be balanced with acid or base. Many do, like the oxidation or reduction of water listed here. To add half reactions they must both be balanced with either acid or base. The acid-balanced reactions predominate in acidic (low pH) solutions, while the base-balanced reactions predominate in basic (high pH) solutions.

{|
|Cathode (reduction):
|2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(''l'') + 2e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;
|→
|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''g'') + 2 OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;(''aq'')
|-
|Anode (oxidation):
|2 OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;(''aq'')
|→ 
|1/2 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''g'') +  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(''l'') + 2 e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;
|}
Combining either half reaction pair yields the same overall decomposition of water into oxygen and hydrogen:

:Overall reaction: 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(''l'') → 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''g'') + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''g'')

The number of hydrogen molecules produced is thus twice the number of oxygen molecules. Assuming equal temperature and pressure for both gases, the produced hydrogen gas has therefore twice the volume of the produced oxygen gas. The number of electrons pushed through the water is twice the number of generated hydrogen molecules and four times the number of generated oxygen molecules.

==Thermodynamics==

[[File:PourbaixWater.png|thumb|300px|right | [[Pourbaix diagram]] for water, including equilibrium regions for water, oxygen and hydrogen at STP. The vertical scale is the electrode potential of a hydrogen or non-interacting electrode relative to an [[Standard hydrogen electrode|SHE]] electrode, the horizontal scale is the [[pH]] of the electrolyte (otherwise non-interacting). Neglecting [[overpotential]], above the top line the equilibrium condition is oxygen gas, and oxygen will bubble off of the electrode until equilibrium is reached. Likewise, below the bottom line, the equilibrium condition is hydrogen gas, and hydrogen will bubble off of the electrode until equilibrium is reached. ]]

Decomposition of pure water into hydrogen and oxygen at [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|standard temperature and pressure]] is not favorable in [[thermochemistry|thermodynamic]] terms.

{|
|Anode (oxidation):
|2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(''l'')
|→ 
|O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''g'') + 4 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(''aq'') + 4e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
|E&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; = +1.23 V&lt;ref&gt;[[standard electrode potential (data page)]]&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
|Cathode (reduction):
|2 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(''aq'') + 2e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;
|→
|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''g'')
|
|E&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.00 V
|}

Thus, the standard potential of the water electrolysis cell (E&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;cell&lt;/sub&gt; = E&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;cathode&lt;/sub&gt; − E&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;anode&lt;/sub&gt;) is -1.23 V at 25&amp;nbsp;°C at pH 0 ([H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] = 1.0 M). At 25&amp;nbsp;°C with pH 7 ([H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] = 1.0{{e|−7}} M), the potential is unchanged based on the [[Nernst equation]].  The thermodynamic standard cell potential can be obtained from standard-state free energy calculations to find ΔG° and then using the equation: ΔG°= -nFE°(where E° is the cell potential). In practice when an electrochemical cell is "driven" toward completion by applying reasonable potential, it is kinetically controlled. Therefore, activation energy, ion mobility (diffusion) and concentration, wire resistance, surface hindrance including bubble formation (causes electrode area blockage), and entropy, require a greater applied potential to overcome these factors. The amount of increase in potential required is termed the [[overpotential]].

==Electrolyte selection==
[[Image:Elektrolyse1.jpg|thumb|[[Hoffman voltameter]] connected to a [[direct current]] [[Switched-mode power supply|power supply]]]]
If the above described processes occur in pure water, H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; [[cation]]s will be consumed/reduced at the cathode and OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; [[anion]]s will consumed/oxidised at the anode. This can be verified by adding a [[pH indicator]] to the water: the water near the cathode is basic while the water near the anode is acidic.  The negative hydroxide ions that approach the anode mostly combine with the positive hydronium ions (H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) to form water.  The positive hydronium ions that approach the cathode mostly combine with negative hydroxide ions to form water.  Relatively few hydronium/hydroxide ions reach the cathode/anode.  This can cause a concentration overpotential at both electrodes.

Pure water is a fairly good insulator since it has a low [[Self-ionization of water|autoionization]], K&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.0×10&lt;sup&gt;−14&lt;/sup&gt; at room temperature and thus pure water conducts current poorly, 0.055 µS·cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Light|first=Truman S.|last2=Licht|first2=Stuart|last3=Bevilacqua|first3=Anthony C.|last4=Morash|first4=Kenneth R.|date=2005-01-01|title=The Fundamental Conductivity and Resistivity of Water|url=http://esl.ecsdl.org/content/8/1/E16|journal=Electrochemical and Solid-State Letters|language=en|volume=8|issue=1|pages=E16–E19|doi=10.1149/1.1836121|issn=1099-0062}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unless a very large potential is applied to cause an increase in the autoionization of water the electrolysis of pure water proceeds very slowly limited by the overall conductivity.

If a water-soluble electrolyte is added, the conductivity of the water rises considerably. The electrolyte disassociates into [[cation]]s and anions; the anions rush towards the anode and neutralize the buildup of positively charged H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; there; similarly, the cations rush towards the cathode and neutralize the buildup of negatively charged OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; there. This allows the continuous flow of electricity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Linus Pauling|Pauling, Linus]] (1970) ''General Chemistry'', Section 15-2. San Francisco.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Electrolyte for water electrolysis ===
Care must be taken in choosing an electrolyte, since an anion from the electrolyte is in competition with the hydroxide ions to give up an [[electron]]. An electrolyte anion with less [[standard electrode potential]] than hydroxide will be oxidized instead of the hydroxide, and no oxygen gas will be produced. A [[cation]] with a greater [[standard electrode potential]] than a hydrogen ion will be reduced instead, and no hydrogen gas will be produced.

The following [[cations]] have lower [[Standard electrode potential|electrode potential]] than H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and are therefore suitable for use as electrolyte cations: [[Lithium|Li]]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, [[Rubidium|Rb]]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, [[Potassium|K]]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, [[Caesium|Cs]]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, [[Barium|Ba]]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, [[Strontium|Sr]]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, [[Calcium|Ca]]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, [[Sodium|Na]]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, and [[Magnesium|Mg]]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. [[Sodium]] and [[lithium]] are frequently used, as they form inexpensive, soluble salts.

If an [[acid]] is used as the electrolyte, the cation is H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, and there is no competitor for the H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; created by disassociating water. The most commonly used anion is [[sulfate]] ({{chem|SO|4|2-}}), as it is very difficult to oxidize, with the standard potential for oxidation of this ion to the [[peroxydisulfate]] ion being +2.05 volts.&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_persulfate&lt;/ref&gt;

Strong acids such as [[sulfuric acid]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), and strong bases such as [[potassium hydroxide]] (KOH), and [[sodium hydroxide]] (NaOH) are frequently used as electrolytes due to their strong conducting abilities.

A solid polymer electrolyte can also be used such as [[Nafion]] and when applied with a special catalyst on each side of the membrane can efficiently split the water molecule with as little as 1.5 Volts. There are also a number of other solid electrolyte systems that have been trialed and developed with a number of electrolysis systems now available commercially that use solid electrolytes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Badwal|first=SPS|author2=Giddey S |author3=Munnings C |title=Hydrogen production via solid electrolytic routes|journal=WIREs Energy and Environment|volume=2|issue=5|pages=473–487|year=2012|doi=10.1002/wene.50|url=http://wires.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WiresArticle/wisId-WENE50.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pure water electrolysis ===
Electrolyte-free pure water electrolysis has been achieved by using deep-sub-Debye-length nanogap [[Electrochemical cell|electrochemical cells]]. When the gap distance between cathode and anode even smaller than [[Debye length|Debye-length]] (1 micron in pure water, around 220 nm in distilled water), the [[Double layer (surface science)|double layer]] regions from two electrodes can overlap with each other, leading to uniformly high electric field distributed inside the entire gap. Such high electric field can significantly enhance the ion transport inside water (mainly due to migration), further enhancing [[self-ionization of water]] and keeping the whole reaction continuing, and showing small resistance between the two electrodes. In this case, the two [[Half-reaction|half-reactions]] are coupled together and limited by electron-transfer steps (electrolysis current saturated when further reducing the electrode distance).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Yifei|last2=Narayanan|first2=S. R.|last3=Wu|first3=Wei|date=2017-07-11|title=Field-Assisted Splitting of Pure Water Based on Deep-Sub-Debye-Length Nanogap Electrochemical Cells|url=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsnano.7b04038|journal=ACS Nano|language=EN|volume=11|issue=8|pages=8421–8428|doi=10.1021/acsnano.7b04038|issn=1936-0851}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Techniques==
{{Main|Water splitting}}

===Fundamental demonstration===
Two [[wire|leads]], running from the terminals of a battery, are placed in a cup of water with a quantity of electrolyte to establish conductivity in the solution. Using NaCl (table salt) in an electrolyte solution results in [[chlorine]] gas rather than oxygen due to a [[Electrolysis#Competing half-reactions in solution electrolysis|competing half-reaction]]. With the correct electrodes and correct electrolyte, such as baking soda ([[sodium bicarbonate]]), hydrogen and oxygen gases will stream from the oppositely charged [[electrode]]s. Oxygen will collect at the positively charged electrode ([[anode]]) and hydrogen will collect at the negatively charged electrode ([[cathode]]). Note that hydrogen is positively charged in the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O molecule, so it ends up at the negative electrode. (And vice versa for oxygen.)

Note that an aqueous solution of water with chloride ions, when electrolysed, will result in either OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; if the concentration of Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; is low, or in chlorine gas being preferentially discharged if the concentration of Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; is greater than 25% by mass in the solution.

[[Image:Elektrolyse2.jpg|thumb|Match test used to detect the presence of hydrogen gas]]

===Hofmann voltameter===
{{Main|Hofmann voltameter}}

The Hofmann voltameter is often used as a small-scale electrolytic cell. It consists of three joined upright cylinders. The inner cylinder is open at the top to allow the addition of water and the electrolyte. A [[platinum]] electrode is placed at the bottom of each of the two side cylinders, connected to the positive and negative terminals of a source of [[electricity]]. When current is run through the Hofmann voltameter, gaseous oxygen forms at the [[anode]] (positive) and gaseous hydrogen at the [[cathode]] (negative). Each gas displaces water and collects at the top of the two outer tubes, where it can be drawn off with a stopcock.

=== Industrial ===
Many industrial electrolysis cells are very similar to [[Hofmann voltameter]]s, with complex platinum plates or honeycombs as electrodes. Generally the only time hydrogen is intentionally produced from electrolysis is for specific point of use application such as is the case with [[oxyhydrogen]] torches or when extremely [[hydrogen purity|high purity hydrogen]] or oxygen is desired. The vast majority of hydrogen is produced from hydrocarbons and as a result contains trace amounts of [[carbon monoxide]] among other impurities. The carbon monoxide impurity can be detrimental to various systems including many [[fuel cell]]s.

=== High-pressure ===
{{Main|High-pressure electrolysis}}
High-pressure electrolysis is the electrolysis of water with a [[compressed hydrogen]] output around 12-20 MPa (120–200 [[bar (unit)|Bar]], 1740–2900 [[Pounds per square inch|psi]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fz-juelich.de/scientific-report-2001/docs/patente/26_11600.pdf?web_session=e4af90eba1518be519b2c1b61fa42cfb 2001-High pressure electrolysis – The key technology for efficient H.2]{{dead link|date=May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By pressurising the hydrogen in the electrolyser, the need for an external [[hydrogen compressor]] is eliminated; the average energy consumption for internal compression is around 3%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.fz-juelich.de/ief/ief-3/datapool/page/214/solar%20energy%2075%20469-478.pdf |title=Ten years of operational experience with a hydrogen-based renewable energy supply system |journal=Solar Energy |volume=75 |issue=6 |pages=469–478 |doi=10.1016/j.solener.2003.09.006 |year=2003 |last1=Ghosh |first1=P.C |last2=Emonts |first2=B |last3=Janßen |first3=H |last4=Mergel |first4=J |last5=Stolten |first5=D |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327074743/http://www.fz-juelich.de/ief/ief-3/datapool/page/214/solar%20energy%2075%20469-478.pdf |archivedate=27 March 2009 |bibcode=2003SoEn...75..469G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== High-temperature ===
{{Main|High-temperature electrolysis}}

High-temperature electrolysis (also HTE or steam electrolysis) is a method currently being investigated for water electrolysis with a [[heat engine]]. High temperature electrolysis may be preferable to traditional room-temperature electrolysis because some of the energy is supplied as heat, which is cheaper than electricity, and because the electrolysis reaction is more efficient at higher temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hi2h2.com/ |title=High temperature electrolysis using SOEC |publisher=Hi2h2 |date= |accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weltemp.eu/ |title=WELTEMP-Water electrolysis at elevated temperatures |publisher=Weltemp.eu |date=31 December 2010 |accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nickel/iron ===
In 2014, researchers announced an electrolysis system made of inexpensive, abundant nickel and iron rather than precious metal catalysts, such as platinum or iridium. The nickel-metal/nickel-oxide structure is more active than pure nickel metal or pure nickel oxide alone. The catalyst significantly lowers the required [[voltage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.kurzweilai.net/a-low-cost-water-splitter-that-runs-on-an-ordinary-aaa-battery|title = A low-cost water splitter that runs on an ordinary AAA battery|date = 22 August 2014|work = KurzweilAI}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="r1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last2=Zhou|first2=Wu|last3=Tsai|first3=Mon-Che|last4=Zhou|first4=Jigang|last5=Guan|first5=Mingyun|last6=Lin|first6=Meng-Chang|last7=Zhang|first7=Bo|last8=Hu|first8=Yongfeng|last9=Wang|first9=Di-Yan|date=2014|title=Nanoscale nickel oxide/nickel heterostructures for active hydrogen evolution electrocatalysis|journal=Nature Communications|volume=5|pages=4695|doi=10.1038/ncomms5695|pmid=25146255|last1=Gong|first1=Ming|last10=Yang|first10=Jiang|last11=Pennycook|first11=Stephen J.|last12=Hwang|first12=Bing-Joe|last13=Dai|first13=Hongjie|bibcode=2014NatCo...5E4695G}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also [[Nickel-iron battery|nickel–iron batteries]] are being investigated for use as combined batteries and electrolysis for hydrogen production.

Mulder et al: ''Efficient electricity storage with the battolyser, an integrated Ni-Fe-battery and electrolyser''. [[Energy and Environmental Science]]. 10, 3, 756-764, 2017, {{DOI|10.1039/C6EE02923J}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nanogap electrochemical cells ===
In 2017, researchers reported using nanogap [[Electrochemical cell|electrochemical cells]] to achieve high-efficiency electrolyte-free pure water electrolysis at room temperature. In nanogap electrochemical cells,  the two electrodes are so close to each other (even smaller than [[Debye length|Debye-length]] in pure water) that the mass transport rate can be even higher than the electron-transfer rate, leading to two [[Half-reaction|half-reactions]] coupled together and limited by electron-transfer step. Experiments shows that the electrical current density from pure water electrolysis can be even larger than that from 1 mol/L sodium hydroxide solution. The mechanism, "Virtual Breakdown Mechanism", is completely different from the well-established traditional electrochemical theory, due to such nanogap size effect.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Applications==

About five percent of hydrogen gas produced worldwide is created by electrolysis. The majority of this hydrogen produced through electrolysis is a side product in the production of [[chlorine#Production|chlorine]] and [[caustic soda]]. This is a prime example of a [[electrolysis#Competing half-reactions in solution electrolysis|competing side reaction]].

:2NaCl + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2NaOH

The [[Chloralkali process|electrolysis of brine]], a water/sodium chloride mixture, is only half the electrolysis of water since the [[chloride]] ions are oxidized to [[chlorine]] rather than water being oxidized to oxygen. Thermodynamically, this would not be expected since the oxidation potential of the chloride ion is less than that of water, but the rate of the chloride reaction is much greater than that of water, causing it to predominate.  The hydrogen produced from this process is either burned (converting it back to water), used for the production of [[specialty chemicals]], or various other small-scale applications.

Water electrolysis is also used to generate oxygen for the [[International Space Station]].&lt;ref name=asme&gt;{{cite web | title=Making Space Safer with Electrolysis|url=http://www.asme.org/kb/news---articles/articles/aerospace---defense/making-space-safer-with-electrolysis|publisher=[[ASME]]| accessdate=26 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nasa&gt;{{cite web | title=Breathing Easy on the Space Station|url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2000/ast13nov_1/|publisher=NASA Science| accessdate=26 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hydrogen may later be used in a [[fuel cell]] as a storage method of energy and water.&lt;ref name=storage&gt;{{cite web | title=Solar Hydrogen Fuel Cell Water Heater (Educational Stand)|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/34346401/Solar-Hydrogen-Fuel-Cell-Water-Heater-Educational-Stand|publisher=[[Scribd]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Efficiency==

=== Industrial output ===
Efficiency of modern hydrogen generators is measured by ''energy consumed per standard volume of hydrogen'' (MJ/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), assuming [[standard temperature and pressure]] of the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The lower the energy used by a generator, the higher would be its efficiency; a 100%-efficient electrolyser would consume {{convert|39.4|kWh/kg|MJ/kg|0}} of [[hydrogen]],&lt;ref name=EU140207&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.fch-ju.eu/sites/default/files/study%20electrolyser_0-Logos_0_0.pdf |title= Development of water electrolysis in the European Union |author= Luca Bertuccioli |work= Client Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking |date= 7 February 2014|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{convert|{{#expr:141840*0.08988round0}}|J/L|MJ/m3|2}}. &lt;!-- H2 density is 0.08988 g/L --&gt; Practical electrolysis (using a rotating electrolyser at 15 bar pressure) may consume {{convert|50|kWh/kg|MJ/kg|0}}, and a further {{convert|15|kWh|MJ|0}} if the hydrogen is compressed for use in hydrogen cars.&lt;ref&gt;Stensvold, Tore (26 January 2016). [http://www.tu.no/artikler/coca-cola-oppskrift-kan-gjore-hydrogen-til-nytt-norsk-industrieventyr/276348 «Coca-Cola-oppskrift» kan gjøre hydrogen til nytt norsk industrieventyr]. ''[[Teknisk Ukeblad]]'', .&lt;/ref&gt;

Electrolyser vendors provide efficiencies based on [[enthalpy]].  To assess the claimed efficiency of an electrolyser it is important to establish how it was defined by the vendor (i.e. what enthalpy value, what current density, etc.).

There are two main technologies available on the market, ''alkaline'' and ''[[proton exchange membrane]]'' (PEM) electrolysers.
Alkaline electrolysers are cheaper in terms of investment (they generally use nickel catalysts), but less efficient; PEM electrolysers, conversely, are more expensive (they generally use expensive platinum-group metal catalysts) but are more efficient and can operate at higher current densities, and can therefore be possibly cheaper if the hydrogen production is large enough.

Conventional alkaline electrolysis has an efficiency of about 70%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stolten|first1=Detlef|title=Hydrogen Science and Engineering: Materials, Processes, Systems and Technology|date=Jan 4, 2016|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn= 9783527674299 |pages=898|url=https://books.google.hu/books?id=we5bCwAAQBAJ&amp;dq|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accounting for the accepted use of the higher heat value (because inefficiency via heat can be redirected back into the system to create the steam required by the catalyst), average working efficiencies for [[PEM electrolysis]] are around 80%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ITM - Hydrogen Refuelling Infrastructure - February 2017|url=http://www.level-network.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/ITM-Power.pdf|website=www.level-network.com|accessdate=17 April 2018|ref=pg12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is expected to increase to between 82-86%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cost reduction and performance increase of PEM electrolysers|url=http://www.fch.europa.eu/sites/default/files/Nov22_Session3_Panel%205_Slot%202_NOVEL-MEGASTACK_Thomassen%20%28ID%202891376%29.pdf|website=www.fch.europa.eu|publisher=Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking|accessdate=17 April 2018|ref=pg9}}&lt;/ref&gt; before 2030.

=== Overpotential ===
Real water electrolysers require higher voltages for the reaction to proceed. The part that exceeds 1.23 V&lt;ref&gt;1.23 V is the standard potential; in non-standard conditions it may be different, in particular it decreases with temperature.&lt;/ref&gt; is called [[overpotential]] or overvoltage, and represents any kind of loss and nonideality in the electrochemical process.

For a well designed cell the largest [[overpotential]] is the [[overpotential#Reaction overpotential|reaction overpotential]] for the four-electron oxidation of water to oxygen at the anode; [[catalyst#Electrocatalysts|electrocatalysts]] can facilitate this reaction, and [[platinum]] alloys are the state of the art for this oxidation. Developing a cheap, effective electrocatalyst for this reaction would be a great advance, and is a topic of current research; there are many approaches, among them a 30-year-old recipe for [[molybdenum sulfide]],&lt;ref name="KibsgaardJaramillo2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kibsgaard|first1=Jakob|last2=Jaramillo|first2=Thomas F.|last3=Besenbacher|first3=Flemming|title=Building an appropriate active-site motif into a hydrogen-evolution catalyst with thiomolybdate [Mo&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; clusters|journal=Nature Chemistry|volume=6|issue=3|year=2014|pages=248–253|doi=10.1038/nchem.1853|pmid=24557141|bibcode=2014NatCh...6..248K}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Potential applications of graphene#Quantum dots|graphene quantum dots]],&lt;ref name="FeiYe2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fei|first1=Huilong|last2=Ye|first2=Ruquan|last3=Ye|first3=Gonglan|last4=Gong|first4=Yongji|last5=Peng|first5=Zhiwei|last6=Fan|first6=Xiujun|last7=Samuel|first7=Errol L.

If other, less effective, materials are used for the cathode (e.g. [[graphite]]), large overpotentials will appear.

=== Thermodynamics ===
The electrolysis of water in standard conditions requires a theoretical minimum of 237 kJ of electrical energy input to dissociate each mole of water, which is the standard [[Gibbs free energy]] of formation of water.  It also requires energy to overcome the change in entropy of the reaction.  Therefore, the process cannot proceed below 286 kJ per mol if no external heat/energy is added.

Since each mole of water requires two moles of [[electron]]s, and given that the [[Faraday constant]] ''F'' represents the charge of a mole of electrons (96485 C/mol), it follows that the minimum voltage necessary for electrolysis is about 1.23 V.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hyman D. Gesser|title=Applied Chemistry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ThedOB_33oIC&amp;pg=PA16|accessdate=18 December 2011|year=2002|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-306-46700-4|pages=16–}}&lt;/ref&gt; If electrolysis is carried out at high temperature, this voltage reduces. This effectively allows the electrolyser to operate at more than 100% electrical efficiency. In electrochemical systems this means that heat must be supplied to the reactor to sustain the reaction. In this way thermal energy can be used for part of the electrolysis energy requirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Badwal|first1=Sukhvinder P.S.|last2=Giddey|first2=Sarbjit|last3=Munnings|first3=Christopher|title=Hydrogen production via solid electrolytic routes|journal=Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Energy and Environment|date=September 2013|volume=2|issue=5|pages=473–487|doi=10.1002/wene.50}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar way the required voltage can be reduced (below 1 V) if fuels (such as carbon, alcohol, biomass) are reacted with water (PEM based electrolyzer in low temperature) or oxygen ions (solid oxide electrolyte based electrolyzer in high temperature). This results in some of the fuel's energy being used to "assist" the electrolysis process and can reduce the overall cost of hydrogen produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Badwal|first1=Sukhvinder P. S.|last2=Giddey|first2=Sarbjit S.|last3=Munnings|first3=Christopher|last4=Bhatt|first4=Anand I.|last5=Hollenkamp|first5=Anthony F.|title=Emerging electrochemical energy conversion and storage technologies (open access)|journal=Frontiers in Chemistry|date=24 September 2014|volume=2|doi=10.3389/fchem.2014.00079|pmid=25309898|pmc=4174133|bibcode=2014FrCh....2...79B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, observing the entropy component (and other losses), voltages over 1.48 V are required for the reaction to proceed at practical current densities (the ''thermoneutral'' voltage).

In the case of water electrolysis, Gibbs free energy represents the minimum ''work'' necessary for the reaction to proceed, and the reaction enthalpy is the amount of energy (both work and heat) that has to be provided so the reaction products are at the same temperature as the reactant (i.e. standard temperature for the values given above).  Potentially, an electrolyser operating at 1.48 V would be 100% efficient.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

== History ==
The Epiphone Valve Jr. version 1 combo was released in 2005 as a part of Epiphone's line of amplifiers. In January 2006 a head version was released and also a version 2 combo. In June 2007 an updated head version and a version 3 combo were released. The first Epiphone Valve Juniors (version 1) were only combo amplifiers and received only a fair reception, due to such problems as buzzing and hum caused by the AC filament voltage. Epiphone then released a head version, correcting these issues and changed the AC filament voltage to DC voltage. Version 2 combos also featured these modifications. The version 1 and version 2 combos feature an 8" 4 ohm  Ceramic [[Guitar speaker|speaker]].

Epiphone released Combo version 3 and a newer version of the head with higher retail prices and feature a variety of tube brands based on availability including [[Electro-Harmonix]], JJ, and Sovtek. The newer versions of the head and version 3 combos feature updated transformers with 4, 8 and 16 ohm outputs and the version 3 combos feature an 8" 16 ohm Eminence Lady Luck speaker. In 2007, Epiphone released a speaker cabinet that can be used with the Epiphone Valve Junior, featuring a 1x 12" 16 ohm Eminence Lady Luck speaker rated at 70watts RMS.

*Combo version 1 has front panel stripes that run along the centre of the front panel and has a 4 ohm output only and an AC filament voltage.
*Combo version 2 has front panel stripes that run along the top of the front panel and has a 4 ohm output only and a DC filament voltage.
*Combo version 3 has front panel stripes that run along the top of the front panel and has 4,8 and 16 ohm outputs and a DC filament voltage.
*Head only versions have 4,8 and 16 ohm outputs.
*Early versions mainly have Sovtek tubes and later versions have a variety of tubes such as JJ, EH and Sovtek tubes.

As of summer 2012, these amps appear to have been dropped from the line. The Amps page no longer exists on the Epiphone website.

== Modifications ==
The Epiphone Valve Junior has become very popular to modify because of its basic design. There are many websites, kits, and forums dedicated to this purpose, including the Epiphone official amps and accessories forum. Some sites offer kits to match the gain characteristics of Marshall, Fender and Vox amplifiers. These kits often do not include a bridge rectifier to convert the version 1 AC filament supply voltage to DC, instead they suggest twisting the AC leads together to cancel the generated electromagnetic fields, a technique used in twisted-pair [[Ethernet]] cable to eliminate [[cross-talk]].

== Valve Junior Hot Rod ==
A somewhat limited edition of the Valve Junior head was produced by Epiphone, dubbed the '''Valve Junior Hot Rod'''. It was released as a response to the extensive number of modifications that were being applied to the regular Valve Junior. The circuitry was altered to include a second [[12AX7]] preamp tube, a gain control, and a [[spring reverb]] in addition to the single volume control, as well as a standby switch to preserve tube life. Thanks to a dual function jack on the amp's rear panel, the Hot Rod can also be used as a standalone reverb unit to be used in conjunction with another amplifier's input or effects loop. In this function, the gain knob becomes the unit's dwell control, the volume knob retains its level function, and the reverb knob becomes the mixture control. When used as a reverb unit, the Hot Rod does not need to have a speaker connected to its output jacks because an internal "dummy load" activates automatically when the Reverb output jack is used.

== Serial Numbers ==
The first 4 digits of the serial number are the date code MMYY (MM=month, YY=year). Version 2 Valve Juniors have date codes starting at "0106" January 2006 up to June 2007 when version 3 was released.

{{Mechanical failure modes}}

A '''fracture''' is the separation of an object or material into two or more pieces under the action of [[stress (physics)|stress]].  The fracture of a solid usually occurs due to the development of certain displacement discontinuity surfaces within the solid. If a displacement develops perpendicular to the surface of displacement, it is called a normal tensile crack or simply a crack; if a displacement develops tangentially to the surface of displacement, it is called a shear crack, slip band, or dislocation.&lt;ref name="cherepanov"&gt;{{Citation |last= Cherepanov |first= G.P. |title= Mechanics of Brittle Fracture}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brittle fractures occur with no apparent deformation before fracture; ductile fractures occur when visible deformation does occur before separation.  '''Fracture strength''' or '''breaking strength''' is the stress when a specimen fails or fractures.  A detailed understanding of how fracture occurs in materials may be assisted by the study of [[fracture mechanics]].

==Fracture strength==
[[File:Stress v strain Aluminum 2.png|thumb|Stress vs. strain curve typical of aluminum&lt;br&gt;
1. [[Ultimate tensile strength]]&lt;br&gt;
2. [[Yield strength]]&lt;br&gt;
3. Proportional limit stress&lt;br&gt;
4. Fracture&lt;br&gt;
5. Offset strain (typically 0.2%)]]

Fracture strength, also known as breaking strength, is the stress at which a specimen [[Structural integrity and failure|fails]] via fracture.&lt;ref name="degarmo"&gt;{{Citation |last= Degarmo |first= E. Paul |last2= Black |first2= J T. |last3= Kohser |first3= Ronald A. |title= Materials and Processes in Manufacturing |publisher= Wiley |page= 32 |year= 2003 |edition= 9th |isbn= 0-471-65653-4 |postscript =.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is usually determined for a given specimen by a [[tensile test]], which charts the [[stress–strain curve]] (see image). The final recorded point is the fracture strength.

Ductile materials have a fracture strength lower than the [[ultimate tensile strength]] (UTS), whereas in brittle materials the fracture strength is equivalent to the UTS.&lt;ref name="degarmo"/&gt; If a ductile material reaches its ultimate tensile strength in a load-controlled situation,{{#tag:ref|A simple load-controlled tensile situation would be to support a specimen from above, and hang a weight from the bottom end.  The load on the specimen is then independent of its deformation.|group="Note"}} it will continue to deform, with no additional load application, until it ruptures.  However, if the loading is displacement-controlled,{{#tag:ref|A simple displacement-controlled tensile situation would be to attach a very stiff [[Jack (device)|jack]] to the ends of a specimen.  As the jack extends, it controls the displacement of the specimen; the load on the specimen is dependent on the deformation.|group="Note"}} the deformation of the material may relieve the load, preventing rupture.

==Types== 
There are two types of fractures :
===Brittle fracture===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Ceramic]] --&gt;
[[File:Glass fracture.jpg|thumb|right|Brittle fracture in glass]]
[[File:Pedalarm Bruch.jpg|thumb|right|Fracture of an aluminum [[crank arm]] of a bicycle, where Bright= brittle fracture, Dark= fatigue fracture.]]

In ''[[brittleness|brittle]] fracture'', no apparent [[plasticity (physics)|plastic deformation]] takes place before fracture. Brittle fracture typically involves little energy absorption and occurs at high speeds—up to 2133.6&amp;nbsp;m/s (7000&amp;nbsp;ft/s) in steel.&lt;ref name="Rolfe" /&gt; In most cases brittle fracture will continue even when loading is discontinued.&lt;ref name="Campbell" /&gt;

In brittle crystalline materials, fracture can occur by ''[[cleavage (crystal)|cleavage]]'' as the result of [[tensile stress]] acting normal to crystallographic planes with low bonding (cleavage planes). In [[amorphous solid]]s, by contrast, the lack of a crystalline structure results in a [[conchoidal fracture]], with cracks proceeding normal to the applied tension.

The theoretical strength of a crystalline material is (roughly)
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_\mathrm{theoretical}= \sqrt{ \frac{E \gamma}{r_o} }&lt;/math&gt;
where: –
:&lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Young's modulus]] of the material,
:&lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the [[surface energy]], and
:&lt;math&gt;r_o&lt;/math&gt; is the equilibrium distance between atomic centers.

On the other hand, a crack introduces a stress concentration modeled by
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_\mathrm{elliptical\ crack}= \sigma_\mathrm{applied}\left(1 + 2 \sqrt{ \frac{a}{\rho}}\right)= 2 \sigma_\mathrm{applied} \sqrt{\frac{a}{\rho}} &lt;/math&gt; (For sharp cracks)
where: –
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_\mathrm{applied}&lt;/math&gt; is the loading stress,
:&lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is half the length of the crack, and
:&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the radius of curvature at the crack tip.

Putting these two equations together, we get
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_\mathrm{fracture}= \sqrt{ \frac{E \gamma \rho}{4 a r_o}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Looking closely, we can see that sharp cracks (small &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;) and large defects (large &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;) both lower the fracture strength of the material.

Recently, scientists have discovered [[supersonic fracture]], the phenomenon of crack propagation faster than the speed of sound in a material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=C. H. Chen |author2=H. P. Zhang |author3=J. Niemczura |author4=K. Ravi-Chandar |author5=M. Marder |title=Scaling of crack propagation in rubber sheets |journal=Europhysics Letters |volume=96 |issue=3|pages=36009 |date=November 2011 |doi=10.1209/0295-5075/96/36009 |url=http://iopscience.iop.org/0295-5075/96/3/36009/|bibcode= 2011EL.....9636009C }}&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon was recently also verified by experiment of fracture in rubber-like materials.

The basic sequence in a typical brittle fracture is: introduction of a flaw either before or after the material is put in service, slow and stable crack propagation under recurring loading, and sudden rapid failure when the crack reaches critical crack length based on the conditions defined by fracture mechanics.&lt;ref name="Campbell"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Campbell|first1=edited by F.C.|title=Fatigue and fracture : understanding the basics|date=2012|publisher=ASM International|location=Materials Park, Ohio|isbn=1615039767}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brittle fracture may be avoided by controlling three primary factors: material [[fracture toughness]] (K&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;), nominal stress level (σ), and introduced flaw size (a).&lt;ref name="Rolfe"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rolfe|first1=John M. Barsom, Stanley T.|title=Fracture and fatigue control in structures : applications of fracture mechanics|date=1999|publisher=ASTM|location=West Conshohocken, Pa.|isbn=0803120826|edition=3.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Residual stresses, temperature, loading rate, and stress concentrations also contribute to brittle fracture by influencing the three primary factors.&lt;ref name="Rolfe" /&gt;

Under certain conditions, ductile materials can exhibit brittle behavior. Rapid loading, low temperature, and triaxial stress constraint conditions may cause ductile materials to fail without prior deformation.&lt;ref name="Rolfe" /&gt;

===Ductile fracture===
[[File:DuctileFailure.jpg|left|thumb|Ductile failure of a specimen strained axially]]

In ''[[ductility|ductile]] fracture'', extensive plastic deformation ([[necking (engineering)|necking]]) takes place before fracture. The terms ''rupture'' or ''ductile rupture'' describe the [[ultimate failure]] of ductile materials loaded in tension. Rather than cracking, the material "pulls apart," generally leaving a rough surface. In this case there is slow propagation and an absorption of a large amount of energy before fracture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Perez|first1=Nestor|title=Fracture Mechanics|date=2016|publisher=Springer|isbn=3319249975|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ductile fracture upd.png|thumb|Schematic representation of the steps in ductile fracture (in pure tension)]]

Because ductile rupture involves a high degree of plastic deformation, the fracture behavior of a propagating crack as modelled above changes fundamentally. Some of the energy from stress concentrations at the crack tips is dissipated by plastic deformation ahead of the crack as it propagates.

The basic steps in ductile fracture are void formation, void coalescence (also known as crack formation), crack propagation, and failure, often resulting in a cup-and-cone shaped failure surface.

== Fracture modes and characteristics ==
{{main|Fracture mechanics}}

There are three standard conventions for defining relative displacements in elastic materials in order to analyze crack propagation&lt;ref name="Rolfe" /&gt; as proposed by [[George Rankine Irwin|Irwin]].&lt;ref name="Jin"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jin|first1=C.T. Sun, Z.-H.|title=Fracture mechanics|date=2012|publisher=Academic Press|location=Waltham, MA|isbn=9780123850010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition fracture can involve uniform strain or a combination of these modes.&lt;ref name="Campbell" /&gt;
[[File:Fracture modes v2.svg|thumb|left|Fracture crack separation modes]]
*'''Mode I crack''' – Opening mode (a [[tensile stress]] normal to the plane of the crack)
*'''Mode II crack''' – Sliding mode (a [[shear stress]] acting parallel to the plane of the crack and perpendicular to the crack front)
*'''Mode III crack''' – Tearing mode (a shear stress acting parallel to the plane of the crack and parallel to the crack front)

The manner in which a crack propagates through a material gives insight into the mode of fracture. With ductile fracture a crack moves slowly and is accompanied by a large amount of plastic deformation around the crack tip. A ductile crack will usually not propagate unless an increased stress is applied and generally cease propagating when loading is removed.&lt;ref name="Campbell" /&gt; In a ductile material, a crack may progress to a section of the material where stresses are slightly lower and stop due to the blunting effect of plastic deformations at the crack tip. On the other hand, with brittle fracture, cracks spread very rapidly with little or no plastic deformation. The cracks that propagate in a brittle material will continue to grow once initiated.

Crack propagation is also categorized by the crack characteristics at the microscopic level. A crack that passes through the grains within the material is undergoing transgranular fracture. A crack that propagates along the grain boundaries is termed an intergranular fracture.  Typically, the bonds between material grains are stronger at room temperature than the material itself, so transgranular fracture is more likely to occur. When temperatures increase enough to weaken the grain bonds, intergranular fracture is the more common fracture mode.&lt;ref name="Campbell" /&gt;

==Notable fracture failures==
Failures caused by brittle fracture have not been limited to any particular category of engineered structure.&lt;ref name="Rolfe"/&gt; Though brittle fracture is less common than other types of failure, the impacts to life and property can be more severe.&lt;ref name="Rolfe" /&gt; The following notable historic failures were attributed to brittle fracture:
*Pressure vessels: [[Great Molasses Flood#Causes|Great Molasses Flood]] in 1919,&lt;ref name="Rolfe" /&gt; New Jersey molasses tank failure in 1973&lt;ref name="Campbell"/&gt; 
*Bridges: [[King Street Bridge (Melbourne)|King Street Bridge]] span collapse in 1962, [[Silver Bridge#Wreckage analysis|Silver Bridge]] collapse in 1967,&lt;ref name="Rolfe" /&gt; partial failure of the [https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/bridge/steel/010710.cfm Hoan Bridge] in 2000 
*Ships: [[RMS Titanic#Building and preparing the ship|Titanic]] in 1912,&lt;ref name="Campbell" /&gt; [[Liberty ship#Problems|Liberty ships]] during World War II,&lt;ref name="Rolfe" /&gt; [[SS Schenectady]] in 1943&lt;ref name="Campbell" /&gt;

'''George Willis Pack''' (born 1831, Peterboro, New York; d. August 31, 1906, Southampton, Long Island, New York) was a second-generation timberman on Michigan's [[Lower Peninsula]]. Building on his father's legacy, over the course of several decades, Pack successfully developed his timber businesses, becoming one of Michigan's first millionaires. His son, [[Charles Lathrop Pack]]; and grandson, [[Randolph Greene Pack]], carried on the family tradition.

== Life and career ==

His father, [[George Pack, Jr.]] had established two sawmills outside of [[Lexington, Michigan]], in a place known as [[Washington Township, Sanilac County, Michigan|Pack's Mills]].

After years of working with the elder Pack, in 1860 George Willis Pack, together with [[John L. Woods]], established [[Carrington, Pack &amp; Company]], in [[Sand Beach Township, Michigan|Sand Beach, Michigan]].

In 1864, with Woods and Jeremiah Jenks, George Willis Pack established a second sawmill, [[Pack, Jenks &amp; Company]], also near Sand Beach.

A third firm, Woods &amp; Company, in [[Port Crescent, Michigan]], was formed in 1870.

In 1876, [[Pack, Woods &amp; Company]] was formed in [[Oscoda, Michigan]], on the [[Au Sable River (Michigan)|Au Sable River]].

George Willis Pack grew to be a wealthy man. He "would be remembered as one of the few millionaires who had lived in [[Huron County, Michigan|Huron County]].&lt;ref&gt;Eyle, pp. 2–9&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gloria''' (meaning ''glory'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]) was a [[central heating]] system used in [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]] beginning in the [[Middle Ages]].  It was a direct descendant of the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[hypocaust]], and due to its slow rate of [[combustion]], it allowed people to use smaller [[fuel]]s such as hay instead of wood.

==Description==
The Gloria consisted of a [[Firebox (architecture)|firebox]], generally located outside (in a courtyard, for example), which burned hay, and one or more ducts that ran under the floors of the rooms to be heated.  The warm exhaust gases from the combustion would pass through these ducts and then be released outside through a vertical flue.

The system is more efficient than a [[fireplace]], because the rate of combustion (and therefore the heat output) can be regulated by restricting the airflow into the firebox.  Moreover, the air required for combustion does not have to pass through the interior of the building, which reduces cold drafts.  Finally, because the firebox is not open to the interior, there is no risk of filling the interior with smoke.

Despite these benefits, it is not advisable to use this system today, as modern furnaces are far more efficient.  The modern equivalent of the Gloria would be [[underfloor heating]], which uses piped hot water under the floor to heat rooms, and like the Gloria, has the benefit of reducing the temperature gradients from floor to ceiling.

'''''H is for Hawk''''' is a memoir by British author [[Helen Macdonald (writer)|Helen Macdonald]]. It won the [[Samuel Johnson Prize]] and [[Costa Book of the Year]] award among other honours.

==Content==
''H is for Hawk'' tells Macdonald's story of the year she spent training a [[northern goshawk]] in the wake of her father's death. Her father, [[Alisdair Macdonald]], was a respected [[photojournalist]] who died suddenly of a heart attack in 2007. Having been a [[falconry|falconer]] for many years, she purchased a young goshawk to help her through the grieving process.

==Reception==

The book reached ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' best-seller list within two weeks of being published in July 2014.&lt;ref name="Cambridge"&gt;Cambridge News, [http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/INTERVIEW-Cambridge-author-Helen-Macdonald-grief/story-22883009-detail/story.html#ixzz3Q3uQGaPk Interview: Cambridge author Helen Macdonald on grief, goshawks, and her best-selling book, H is for Hawk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206014230/http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/INTERVIEW-Cambridge-author-Helen-Macdonald-grief/story-22883009-detail/story.html |date=2015-02-06 }}, Cambridge News, 7 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with ''[[The Guardian]]'', Macdonald said, "While the backbone of the book is a memoir about that year when I lost my father and trained a hawk, there are also other things tangled up in that story which are not memoir. There is the shadow biography of [[T. H. White|TH White]]&lt;!--sic--&gt;, and a lot of nature-writing, too. I was trying to let these different genres speak to each other."&lt;ref name="Moss"&gt;Stephen Moss, [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/nov/05/helen-macdonald-interview-winner-samuel-johnson-prize-falconry Helen Macdonald: a bird’s eye view of love and loss], The Guardian, 5 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Judges of the Samuel Johnson Prize specifically highlighted that marriage of genres as one of the reasons for selecting ''H is for Hawk'' as the winner.&lt;ref name="Moss" /&gt;

==Television==
In "H is for Hawk: A New Chapter", part of BBC's ''[[Natural World (TV series)|Natural World]]'' series in 2017, she trained a new goshawk chick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=H is for Hawk: A New Chapter|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b09b68wy|website=BBC|accessdate=25 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Horsehead Nebula''' (also known as '''Barnard 33''') is a [[dark nebula]] in the constellation [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Arnett |first=Bill |title=Horsehead Nebula |url=http://astro.nineplanets.org/twn/b33x.html |date=2000 |accessdate=July 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nebula is located just to the south of [[Zeta Orionis|Alnitak]], the easternmost star of [[Orion's Belt]], and is part of the much larger [[Orion Molecular Cloud Complex]]. The nebula was first recorded in 1888 by [[Scotland|Scottish]] astronomer [[Williamina Fleming]] on a photographic plate taken at the [[Harvard College]] Observatory.&lt;ref name="Cannon"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cannon|first=Annie J.|date=June 1911|title=WILLIAMINA PATON FLEMING|journal=Science|publication-date=June 30, 1911|volume=33|issue=861|pages=987–988|bibcode=1911Sci....33..987C|doi=10.1126/science.33.861.987|pmid=17799863|authorlink=Annie Jump Cannon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Horsehead Nebula is approximately 1500 [[light year]]s from Earth. It is one of the most identifiable nebulae because its resemblance to a [[horse]]'s head.&lt;ref name="noao.edu"&gt;{{cite web |last=Sharp |first=Nigel |title=The Horsehead Nebula |website=National Optical Astronomy Observatory |url= http://www.noao.edu/image_gallery/html/im0057.html |publisher=Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy |date=2014 |accessdate=July 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The dark cloud of dust and gas is a region in the Orion Molecular Cloud Complex where star formation is taking place. It is located in the constellation of [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]], which is prominent in the winter evening sky in the Northern Hemisphere and the summer evening sky in the Southern Hemisphere. This [[stellar nursery]] contains over 100 known kinds of organic and inorganic gases as well as dust; some of the latter is made up of large and complex organic molecules.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

The red colour originates from [[hydrogen]] gas predominantly behind the nebula, ionized by the nearby bright star [[Sigma Orionis]]. [[Magnetic field]]s channel the gases leaving the nebula into streams, shown as streaks in the background glow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.noao.edu/image_gallery/html/im0661.html|title = The Horsehead Nebula/IC434|accessdate = 12 May 2014|website = National Optical Astronomy Observatory|publisher = NOAO|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; A glowing strip of hydrogen gas marks the edge of the massive cloud, and the densities of nearby stars are noticeably different on either side.

The heavy concentrations of dust in the Horsehead Nebula region and neighbouring Orion Nebula are localized, resulting in alternating sections of nearly complete opacity and transparency.&lt;ref name="MorganLodén1966"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morgan|first1=W.W.|last2=Lodén|first2=Kerstin|title=Some Characteristics of the Orion Association|journal=Vistas in Astronomy|volume=8|date=1966|pages=83–88|issn=0083-6656|doi=10.1016/0083-6656(66)90023-7|bibcode = 1966VA......8...83M }}&lt;/ref&gt; The darkness of the Horsehead is caused mostly by thick dust blocking the light of stars behind it.&lt;ref name="Mayo Greenberg2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mayo Greenberg|first1=J|title=Cosmic dust and our origins|journal=Surface Science|volume=500|issue=1-3|date=2002|pages=793–822|issn=0039-6028|doi=10.1016/S0039-6028(01)01555-2|bibcode = 2002SurSc.500..793M }}&lt;/ref&gt; The lower part of the Horsehead's neck casts a shadow to the left.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite APOD|title = The Horsehead Nebula|date = 21 July 2009|access-date = 12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The visible dark nebula emerging from the gaseous complex is an active site of the formation of "low-mass" stars. Bright spots in the Horsehead Nebula's base are young stars just in the process of forming.

[[File:Timex Weekender Indiglo.gif|thumb|Indiglo feature on a Timex Weekender analog watch]]
'''Indiglo''' is a product feature on watches marketed by [[Timex Group USA|Timex]], incorporating an [[electroluminescence|electroluminescent panel]] as a [[backlight]] for even illumination of the watch dial.

The brand is owned by Indiglo Corporation, which is in turn solely owned by Timex, and the name derives from the word [[indigo]], as the original watches featuring the technology emitted a green-blue light. The Indiglo name was originally developed by Austin Innovations Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ge-and-austin-innovations-inc-team-up-to-market-energy-efficient-electroluminescent-technology-75493097.html|title=GE and Austin Innovations, Inc., Team Up to Market Energy-Efficient Electroluminescent Technology |date=24 September 1997|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304081939/http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ge-and-austin-innovations-inc-team-up-to-market-energy-efficient-electroluminescent-technology-75493097.html|archivedate=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Timex introduced the Indiglo technology in 1992 in their ''Ironman'' watch line and subsequently expanded its use to 70% of their watch line, including men's and women's watches, sport watches and chronographs. [[Casio]] introduced their version of electroluminescent backlight technology, [[Illuminator (backlight)|Illuminator]], in 1995.

Indiglo backlights typically emit a distinct greenish-blue color and evenly light the entire display or dial. Certain Indiglo models, e.g., [[Timex Datalink|Timex Datalink USB]], use a negative [[liquid-crystal display]] so that only the digits are illuminated, rather than the entire display.

Hunter Fann company has also incorporated Indiglo technology in lighting the displays on many of its thermostats.{{fact|date=June 2016}}

==TX subdivision and Indiglo==
From 2006-2011, the [[Timex Group]] marketed a line of high-end quartz watches under the [[TX Watch Company]] brand, using a proprietary six-hand, four-motor, micro-processor controlled movement.&lt;ref name="txstart"&gt;{{cite web
  | title = Timex: Start in ein neues Zeitalter
  | publisher = Goettgen.de
  | author = 
  | date = 
  | url = http://www.goettgen.de/fz/start-ein-neues-zeitalter-1316836800}}&lt;/ref&gt; To separate the brand from Timex, the movements had luxury features associated with a higher-end brand, e.g.,  sapphire crystals and stainless steel or titanium casework &amp;mdash; and used hands treated with [[Super-LumiNova|super-luminova]] luminescent pigment for low-light legibility &amp;mdash; rather than indiglo technology. 

When the Timex Group migrated the microprocessor-controlled, multi-motor, multi-hand technology to its Timex brand in 2012,&lt;ref name="txsamemovement"&gt;{{cite web
  | title = A German-Engineered Timex to Consider 
  | publisher = Timezone.com
  | author = Damon Michau
  | date = August 19, 2012
  | url = http://wp-test.timezone.com/category/features/timezone-features/page/6/}}&lt;/ref&gt; it created a sub-collection marketed as '''Intelligent Quartz (IQ)'''.  The line employed the same movements and capabilities from the TX brand,&lt;ref name="txsamemovement"/&gt; at a much lower price-point -- incorporating indiglo technology rather than the super-luminova pigments.

In [[organic chemistry]], '''isothiouronium''' is a [[functional group]] with the formula [RSC(NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (R = [[alkyl]], [[aryl]]) and is the [[acid salt]] of [[isothiourea]].  The H centres can also be replaced by alkyl and aryl.  Structurally, these cations resemble [[guanidinium]] cations.  The CN&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S core is planar and the C-N bonds are short.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1107/S0108270198008166 | title = ''S''-Benzylisothiouronium Chloride | year = 1998 | last1 = Barker | first1 = J. | last2 = Powell | first2 = H. R. | journal = Acta Crystallographica Section C | volume = 54 | issue = 12 | pages = 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synthesis==

Salts comprising these anions are typically prepared by [[alkylation]] of [[thiourea]]:
:SC(NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  RX   →   [RSC(NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;X&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

==Reactions==
[[Hydrolysis]] of isothiouronium salts gives [[thiol]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{OrgSynth|author=Helmer Kofod|year=1963|title=Furfuryl Mercaptan|volume=4|pages=13|collvol=1|collvolpages=66|prep=CV4P0491}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:[RSC(NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;X&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;  +  NaOH    →   RSH  +  OC(NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  NaX

Isothiouronium salts in which the sulfur has been alkylated, such as ''S''-methylisothiourea hemisulfate (CAS No: 867-44-7), will convert [[amine]]s into [[guanidinium]] groups. This approach is sometimes called the '''Rathke synthesis''' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Palmer|first1=David C.|title=''S''-Methylisothiourea|journal=e-EROS Encyclopedia of Reagents for Organic Synthesis|year=2001|doi=10.1002/047084289X.rm199s}}&lt;/ref&gt; after [[Bernhard Rathke]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Heinrich Bernhard Rathke.

The {{nihongo|'''Japan Atomic Power Company'''|日本原子力発電|Nihon Genshiryoku Hatsuden|JAPC}} is a company initially formed to jump start the commercial use of [[nuclear power in Japan]], and currently operates two different [[Nuclear power|sites]].  According to the official web site, JAPC is "the only power company in Japan solely engaged in nuclear energy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japc.co.jp/english/company/index.html |title=Corporate Overview |accessdate=2008-01-08 |publisher=Japan Atomic Power Company |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081113133320/http://www.japc.co.jp/english/company/index.html |archivedate=2008-11-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

JAPC owns both units at the [[Tōkai Nuclear Power Plant]] and the [[Tsuruga Nuclear Power Plant]] with plans to expand at Tsuruga.

The company is jointly owned by Japan's major [[Electric utility|electric utilities]]: [[The Tokyo Electric Power Company]] (28.23%), [[Kansai Electric Power]] (18.54%), [[Chubu Electric Power]] (15.12%), [[Hokuriku Electric Power Company]] (13.05%), [[Tohoku Electric Power]] (6.12%), and [[Electric Power Development Company]] (J-Power) (5.37%).

== Accidents ==
On 11 March 2011 several nuclear reactors in Japan were badly damaged by the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]].
The [[Tōkai Nuclear Power Plant]] lost external electric power, experienced the failure of one of its two cooling pumps, and two of its three emergency power generators. External electric power could only be restored two days after the earthquake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://af.reuters.com/article/energyOilNews/idAFTKG00708120110313 |title=Cooling system pump stops at Tokai No.2 plant-Kyodo; Energy &amp; Oil; Reuters|first= |last= |work=af.reuters.com |accessdate=13 March 2011 |date=13 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/03/13/uk-japan-quake-tokai-idUKTRE72C2RL20110313 |title=Tokai No.2 nuke plant cooling process working - operator &amp;#124; Reuters |first= Kiyoshi|last=Takenaka|work=uk.reuters.com |quote=Japan Atomic Power said Monday that the cooling process was working at its Tokai No.2 nuclear power plant's reactor although two of the three diesel power generators used for cooling were out of order. |accessdate=13 March 2011 |date=13 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Selling Uranium stock ==
In February 2013 in an attempt to raise money to be able to pay back loans due in April 2013, Japan Atomic Power did sell part of its uranium-stock. Streamlining and selling the uranium would be needed to pay back 40 billion yen. After April 2013 the major shareholders were expected to guarantee the payments for some 100 billion yen in loans. Japan Atomic Power refused to disclose the buyer.&lt;ref&gt;The Mainichi Shimbun (21 February 2013) [http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20130221p2g00m0dm033000c.html Japan Atomic Power takes rare step to sell uranium for loan payment]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities Abroad ==

Japan's first nuclear activity in a previously non-nuclear country will be four 1000 MW reactors at [[Ninh Thuận 2 Nuclear Power Plant]]. The feasibility study to be carried out by Japan Atomic Power Company.&lt;ref name=nei031110&gt;

'''John C. Lincoln''' (July 17, 1866 - May 24, 1959) was an American inventor, entrepreneur, philanthropist and in 1924, the Vice-Presidential candidate under the Commonwealth Land Party ticket. He held 55 patents on several electrical devices, founded the Lincoln Electric Co., invested in the construction of the Camelback Inn, presided over he Bagdad Mine and funded two hospitals in Phoenix, one which bears his name.

==Early years==
Lincoln (birth name: '''John Cromwell Lincoln''') was born in [[Painesville, Ohio]] to William Edward Lincoln,  (1831 - 1920), an abolitionist minister and Frances Louise Marshall Lincoln (1839 - 1918), a physician. There he received his primary and secondary education. In 1888, he graduated from [[Ohio State University]] with a degree in Electrical Engineering and soon after became a construction superintendent. He trained under Charles F. Brush, who invented the arc light and engineered America’s first electric street car. In 1891,Lincoln patented his first invention, an electric brake for street-railway cars.&lt;ref name="LE"&gt;[http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/history2/98/Lincoln-Electric-Co.html Lincoln Electric Co.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LL"&gt;[http://www.phoenixmag.com/history/the-lincoln-legacy.html Lincoln Legacy]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1984/01/15/business/the-way-that-works-at-lincoln.html?pagewanted=all New Times Business Day]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ARJCL"&gt;[http://www.cooperative-individualism.org/clancy-robert_a-remembrance-of-john-c-lincoln-1959.htm "A Remembrance of John C. Lincoln", by: Robert Clancy]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1889, [[Henry George]], visited Cleveland  to speak  about his ideals. George was an American [[political economist]] and journalist whose writing was immensely popular in the 19th century, and sparked several reform movements of the [[Progressive Era]]. His writings also inspired the economic philosophy known as [[Georgism]], based on the belief that people should own the value they produce themselves, but that the economic value derived from [[land (economics)|land]] (including [[natural resource]]s) should belong equally to all members of society.&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of American Biography,'' 1st. ed., s.v. "George, Henry," edited by Allen Johnson and Dumas Malone, Vol. VII (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1931), pp. 211–212.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln was among those in the crowd who attended the political meeting. He was impressed with George and read George's book "Progress and Poverty" three times. His enthusiasm was such that he became a member of the [[Single Tax]] Georgism movement.&lt;ref name="LF"&gt;[https://hgarchives.org/historical-collections-2/john-c-lincoln-the-lincoln-foundation-and-the-lincoln-institute-of-land-policy-1943-2004/#JCLincoln Lincoln Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Lincoln Electric Company==
[[File:Lincoln Electric Logo.png|thumb|200px|The Lincoln Electric Company Logo]]
In 1895, he founded the [[Lincoln Electric|Lincoln Electric Company]] in [[Cleveland, Ohio]] with a capital investment of $200.00. Lincoln used the facilities of his company to do research and to experiment with the electrical devices which he invented. The main product of the company was electric motors of his own design. He was directly responsible for 55 patents which gained him national fame as an industrialist. Lincoln helped finance the education of his brother James F. Lincoln who joined him upon his graduation in 1907, as the sales director of the company. The product line of the company expanded and included battery chargers for electric automobiles. In 1914, James F. Lincoln headed and supervised the company as general manager. This in turn gave Lincoln the time that he needed to continue with his research, experiments and inventions. The first variable voltage, single operator, portable welding machine in the world was introduced by the Lincoln Electric Co. in 1911. Lincoln created and patented  a flux. The flux made a weld as flexible as steel. The shielded arc welding process developed by Lincoln  played an important role in the manufacture of merchant ships in [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="ARJCL"/&gt;
He developed an employee bonus system in the company which made them the highest paid in the industry. This system was successful he would eventually apply it to his future ventures. In 1933, Lincoln published "The Procedure Handbook of Arc Welding Design".&lt;ref name="LE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

==Commonwealth Land Party==

The [[single tax|Single Tax Party]], a political party, was renamed in 1924, and became the [[Commonwealth Land Party (United States)|Commonwealth Land Party]]. The party's logo included an image of the earth with the phrase, “The Birthright of All Mankind”. [[New York City]] served as the Party headquarters with state branches in Ohio, [[Pennsylvania]], and [[New Jersey]].

The party platform was the following:
*That the Earth is the Birthright of All Mankind and that All have and Equal and Unalienable Right to its Use.
*That man’s need for land is expressed by the rent of land; that land rent results from the presence and productive activities of the people; that it arises as the result of natural law, and that it therefore should be taken to defray public expenses.

Lincoln became a member of the Commonwealth Land Party and in 1924, was nominated by the party for Vice-President with William J. Wallace, from [[New Jersey]], running for President in the [[United States presidential election|Presidential Elections of 1924]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://hgarchives.org/historical-collections-2/the-commonwealth-land-party-and-associated-branches/ The Commonwealth Land Party and Associated Branches]&lt;/ref&gt; The Wallace and Lincoln team received 2,778 of the [[Popular vote (representative democracy)|Popular vote]] and 0 [[Electoral college|Electoral vote]]s in comparison with the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]'s candidates [[Calvin Coolidge]] and [[Charles G. Dawes]] who received 15,725,016 of the Popular votes and 382 Electoral votes thus, winning the Presidential election.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h892.html United States History]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sunnyslope, Arizona==
Lincoln's first wife was Myrtle H Humphrey Lincoln. On April 4, 1892, he had a daughter with Myrtle whom they named [[Louise Lincoln Kerr|Louise Lincoln]]. Myrtle died in 1913. He later met and married Helen Colville. Helen was a college graduate and former educator who taught math and science. On June 15, 1922, she gave birth to a child, whom they named Joseph Colville Lincoln. Eventually, they had two more daughters and three sons.&lt;ref name="LE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

[[File:Phoenix-Sunnyslope-Area where Desesrt Mission was founded-1927.JPG|250px|thumb|This is where the historic Desert Mission of Sunnyslope was founded. A plaque marking the historical site, commissioned by the Sunnyslope Historical Society and the John C. Lincoln Hospital, was placed on this site on March 7, 1992.]]

In 1931, Lincoln's wife Helen was diagnosed with tuberculosis. He learned about the Desert Mission which was founded in 1927, by  Marguerite Colley and Elizabeth Beatty in [[Sunnyslope, Arizona]]. This was a facility – a comprehensive, faith-based community center — that provided for the medical, social, and religious needs of the people living in the Sunnyslope Community. He was also told that the dry air and climate in Arizona was good for those who suffered from the disease. He then decided to move, with Helen and their three children, from Cleveland to Sunnyslope for the sake of his wife's health. Within two years, Helen was again healthy and the Lincoln's started to work with the Desert Mission, the haven for the sick and poor of Sunnyslope. He promoted Phoenix as a haven for health seekers.&lt;ref name="LE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

In 1933, the Lincolns’ made an initial donation of $2,000 which helped buy 20 acres for the Mission’s expansion. This initial donation was the first of many contributions which he made to the organization which was renamed the John C. Lincoln Health Network in 1954. Helen fought and worked for the burgeoning network.&lt;ref name="LE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; Lincoln became the director of the Desert Mission of the Young Men's Christian Association and the Good Samaritan Hospital in Arizona.&lt;ref name="ARJCL"/&gt;

In 1936, there were approximately 600 residents in Sunny Slope. There was still much vacant land, covered with vegetation and cacti. As the Sunnyslope neighborhood grew, the medical functions of the Desert Mission became a separate entity by the 1950s, later known as the John C. Lincoln Health Network, and now known as "HonorHealth"&lt;ref group=note&gt;In this case there is no separation between the words "Honor" and "Health"&lt;/ref&gt; after a 2013 merger with Scottsdale Healthcare. The Desert Mission remains in operation as a subsidiary of this healthcare group.&lt;ref name="PNT"&gt;[http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/2011-03-24/culture/taking-pride-in-sunnyslope/  Phoenix New Times]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SVV"&gt;[http://mysunnyslope.com/Publications/September2012.pdf Sunnyslope Village Voice Vol. XXVI I No. 09 September 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln also joined in the construction of the [[Camelback Inn]] in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]]. Lincoln had made many investments in real estate and owned large tracts of land between the slopes of Mummy and [[Camelback Mountain]]s. The property was a remote desert scrub land located {{convert|12|mi|km}} outside Phoenix and had no water, electricity or telephone access.&lt;ref name="LE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

Jack Stewart, a sportswriter and publicist, approached Lincoln with an idea. He wanted to build a [[pueblo|pueblo-style]] hotel which could reflect Southwestern and Native American culture rather than the more commonplace [[dude ranch]]-style resort. Lincoln became convinced that the project had potential and invested $200,000 plus, the land that he owned between the Mummy and Camelback Mountains.&lt;ref name=Driggs&gt;{{cite book | first=Gary |last=Driggs |title=Images of America: Camelback Mountain | publisher=Arcadia Publishing | year=2008 | pages=73–79 | ISBN=978-0-7385-4840-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Camelback Inn opened on December 15, 1936, under the management of Stewart, with the slogan "Where Time Stands Still". There were accommodations for 77 guests.&lt;ref name=Driggs/&gt; Lincoln served as president of the Inn from 1936 to 1959. The resort became very  popular among [[Hollywood]] celebrities and political leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Susan | last=Felt | url=http://www.azcentral.com/travel/arizona/features/articles/0416tra-camelback0416.html | title=Camelback Inn Endures | publisher=[[Arizona Republic]] |date=April 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among the early celebrities who frequented the Inn were [[Mamie Eisenhower|Mrs. Dwight D. Eisenhower]], [[Clark Gable]], [[Jimmy Stewart]], [[Bette Davis]], and [[J. Willard Marriott|J.W. Marriott, Sr.]], who shared the Stewart's love for the Camelback Inn.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marriott.com/hotel-info/phxcb-jw-marriott-scottsdale-camelback-inn-resort-and-spa/history/hzs77mm/first-resort.mi  Marriott's First Resort]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, the Camelback Inn was purchased by [[Bill Marriott]] of Marriott International and in March 2003, the hotel was officially renamed by its parent corporation as "Camelback Inn, a JW Marriott Resort &amp; Spa". It is located at 5402 East Lincoln Drive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Staff | url=http://www.eastvalleytribune.com/article_8ef9a00f-8ac9-5ad3-ac4b-5d97b17a2179.html | title=Camelback Inn getting prestigious name change  | publisher=East Valley Tribune | date=October 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Universal Wire Spring Company==
He also had a financial interest in the Universal Wire Spring Company. Among the many products he patented in the company's' name are:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/patents/US2308772 Patents]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Bagdad Mine and Copper Company==
[[File:Malachite-Quartz-Chrysocolla-22818.jpg|150px|thumb|[[Malachite]]-[[Quartz]]-[[Chrysocolla]] specimen from the Bagdad Mine]]
The Lincoln family began to acquire Bagdad Mining stock in the latter part of World War II. By September 1944, Lincoln acquired 50% in the Bagdad Mine stock and had become the president of the Bagdad Copper Company. The Bagdad Mine represents one of the largest copper reserves in the [[United States]] and in the world, having estimated reserves of 873.6 million tonnes of ore grading 0.36% copper.&lt;ref name="Iacobeni"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canadianminingjournal.com/news/good-news-from-bagdad-the-mine/1000155191/|title=Bagdad Copper Mine|year=2012|publisher=canadianminingjournal.com|accessdate=2017-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is located in [[Yavapai County, Arizona]], just west of the unincorporated community of [[Bagdad, Arizona|Bagdad]].&lt;ref name="Iacobeni"/&gt; Lincoln  established a laboratory in the mining area dedicated to the research of the oxide ores. He had a small pilot plant built to test the fluosolids roasting of the sulfide concentrates. Ernest Russell Dickie, who was familiar with the [[Vulture Mine]], became Lincolns' associate. Dickie supervised its activities throughout the years of vast expansion and development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://docs.azgs.az.gov/OnlineAccessMineFiles/A-B/BagdadYavapai119b-4.pdf Bagdad Mine]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Lincoln Institute of Land Policy==

In 1946, Lincoln established the Lincoln Foundation in Phoenix. He was inspired by Henry George's ideals which in turn served as an inspiration to create the Foundation. In 1966, the [[University of Hartford]] in [[Connecticut]] accepted the establishment of the foundation's John C. Lincoln Institute within its campus. Eventually, the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy established an independent school and as such became the primary grant recipient of the foundation. The Lincoln Institute of Land Policy school is located just outside of Harvard Square at 113 Brattle Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts.&lt;ref name="LI"&gt;[http://www.lincolninst.edu/about-lincoln-institute Lincoln Institute of Land Policy]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Henry George School of Social Science==
In 1947, Lincoln became the third president of the Board of Trustees of the Henry George School of Social Science in New York upon the death of Anna George de Mille, daughter of [[Henry George]]. He served in this position until 1958. As stated in the beginning of this article Lincoln as a young man had read "Progress and Poverty" by Henry George and became a believer of George's ideas.&lt;ref name="ARJCL"/&gt;

Lincoln made monetary contributions to the school as an individual. However, he received complaints from different factions about various upsets at the school. He then decided to use the Lincoln Foundation, which he created, in 1946 to channel his contributions. For a number of years, the Lincoln Foundation supported the school.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.georgistjournal.org/tag/henry-george-school/ Memorandum on the Henry George School]&lt;/ref&gt;

In July, 1957, on the occasion of the 25th anniversary banquet of the Henry George School the school's vice president, Ezra Cohen, paid tribute to Lincoln and saluted him:&lt;ref name="ARJCL"/&gt;

==John C. Lincoln Medical Center==
[[File:Phoenix-(Sunnyslope)-John C. Lincoln Medical Center-1965.jpg|200px|thumb|left|John C. Lincoln Medical Center in Sunnyslope.]]
Lincoln donated the money to begin construction of the John C. Lincoln Medical Center in [[Sunnyslope, Arizona|Sunnyslope]] section of Phoenix and the John C. Lincoln Deer Valley Medical Center which now goes by the name of the Deer Valley Medical Center. Upon his death in 1959,  Helen and his friends almost immediately began fundraising for an official hospital to commemorate his deeds. John C. Lincoln Hospital opened its doors in 1965.&lt;ref name="LE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

John C. Lincoln Medical Center is currently a 266-bed, full-service hospital. It's a leader in robotic and scarless surgery and has extensive cardiology and heart care services with a radiation-free, 3D heart mapping system. The hospital is an American College of Surgeons-verified Level I Trauma Center, a Primary Stroke Center, and an accredited Chest Pain Center. General surgery residents are trained there.&lt;ref name="JCLH"/&gt;

Other services include a specialty surgery unit to care for orthopedic, urology, neurology and other surgery patients, inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation services, critical care unit, interventional radiology, and inpatient and outpatient medical imaging.

Lincolns' descendants have all been members of the network’s board of directors of the John C. Lincoln Health Network.&lt;ref name="LE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

==Later years==
[[File: Phoenix-Cemetery-Greenwood Memory Lawn Cemetery-John C. Lincoln.jpg|200px|thumb|Grave-site of John C. Lincoln]]
Lincoln was experimenting with high speed crushing rolls when he died on May 24, 1959, at the age of 92. He is buried in Phoenix's [[Greenwood/Memory Lawn Mortuary &amp; Cemetery]]. At the time of his death he was survived by Mrs. Lincoln, two daughters and three sons.&lt;ref name="ARJCL"/&gt; Lincolns' 55th patent was awarded posthumously for a spring cushion that’s still used in cars today. Lincoln Drive in Phoenix is named after him. In 1998, Lincoln was posthumously inducted into the American Mining Hall of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miningfoundationsw.org/John_Lincoln American Mining Hall of Fame 1998 Inductee from Mining's Past]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

Lincolns' second wife, Helen lived to be 102, she died November 12, 1994, beating her prognosis by six decades. She is buried alongside her husband in Greenwood/Memory Lawn Mortuary &amp; Cemetery.&lt;ref name="LE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

The [[American Welding Society]] established the AWS Foundation which awards the John C. Lincoln Memorial Scholarship. The purpose of the scholarship is to provide financial assistance to those individuals interested in pursuing a career in welding engineering. The John C.

The '''''Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry''''' is a [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[scientific journal]] on [[electroanalytical method|electroanalytical chemistry]], published by [[Elsevier]] twice per month. It was originally established in 1959 under the current name, but was known as the '''''Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry and Interfacial Electrochemistry ''''' from 1967 to 1991. It is currently edited by [[J. M. Feliu]] ([[Universidad de Alicante]]). The journal is associated with the [[International Society of Electrochemistry]]. While the journal is now published exclusively in English, earlier volumes sometimes published articles in [[French language|French]] and [[German language|German]].

The journal, which ''[[The New York Times]]'' described as "a specialty publication not widely circulated" in 1990,&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;
&lt;!-- The NYT mistakenly refers to the journal as "The Journal of Electroanalytic Chemistry"--&gt;

==Construction, cost and funding==
The feasibility study put the cost of construction at US$435 million. The scope of work involves construction of (a) a dam (b) a powerhouse (c) a substation (d) service roads. It also includes the installation of (e) four turbines (f) transformers (g) generators and () the laying of transmission lines.&lt;ref name="Seven"&gt;{{cite web|access-date=21 April 2018 |

The '''land grant to Ḫasardu [[kudurru]]''', is a four-sided limestone ''narû'', or memorial stele, from the late 2nd millennium BC [[Mesopotamia]] recording the gift of 144 hectares of land on the bank of the Royal Canal in the Bīt-Pir’i-Amurru region of the [[Diyala River|Diyala]] valley by [[Kassites|Kassite]] monarch [[Meli-Shipak II|Meli-Šipak]] (ca. 1186–1172 BC) to an official or ''sukkal mu’irri'', by the name of Ḫa-&lt;small&gt;SAR&lt;/small&gt;''-du'' (reading uncertain). It is titled, “O [[Adad]], the hero, bestow irrigation ditches of abundance here!"&lt;ref name=robson&gt;{{ cite book | title = Mathematics in Ancient Iraq: A Social History | author = Eleanor Robson | publisher = Princeton University Press | year = 2008 | pages = 167, 169 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is notable for the light it sheds on middle [[Babylonia]]n officialdom.

==The stele==

The object was excavated by [[Hormuzd Rassam]] during his 1881–82 excavations in [[Sippar]] on behalf of the British Museum. It was recovered, along with two other entitlement stelae, from a room in the temple of [[Shamash|Šamaš]]&lt;ref name=robson/&gt; and given the museum reference BM 90829.

===Deities invoked===

Thirteen gods are invoked by name together with "all the gods whose names are portrayed on this ''narû''." These are represented by eighteen icons arranged around the conical top.

The god [[Marduk]] is pictured twice, once by a ''[[kusarikku]]'' holding a spade, and once with a ''marru'' or tasseled spade in front of the ''kusarikku''. [[Enki|Ea]] may be represented both by the south wind and a ram-headed crook.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title = Das Geistige Erfassen Der Welt Im Alten Orient: Sprache, Religion, Kultur Und Gesellschaft | chapter = The Four Winds and the Origins of Pazuzu | author = F. A. M. Wiggerman | editor = Claus Wilcke | publisher = Eisenbrauns | year = 2007 | page = 154 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Šuqamuna and Šumalia, the [[Kassite deities]] associated with the investiture of kings are portrayed by a bird on a perch. Several of the symbols are widely attested icons of their gods such as the lunar disc for [[Sin (mythology)|Sîn]], solar disc for Šamaš, the lightning-fork for Adad, the lamp for [[Nusku]], the leaping dog for [[Nintinugga|Gula]], the mace with twin lion-heads for [[Nergal]], the eagle-headed mace for [[Ninurta]], the eight-pointed star for [[Ishtar|Ištar]], and the coiled snake for [[Ištaran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title = The Triumph of the Symbol: Pictorial Representation of Deities in Mesopotamia and the Biblical Image Ban | author = Tallay Ornan | publisher = Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht | year = 2005 | pages = 45–52 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cast of characters===

The principal parties to the transaction were the king and a Kassite military official:

* Meli-Šipak, ''šar kiššati'', "king of the world" (the donor)
* Ḫa-&lt;small&gt;SAR&lt;/small&gt;''-du'', son of Sumû, ''sukkal mu'erru'', messenger&lt;sup&gt;?&lt;/sup&gt; of the commander&lt;ref name=sassmannshausen&gt;{{ cite book | title = Betträge zur verwaltung und Gesellschaft Babyloniens in der Kassitenzeit | author = L. Sassmannshausen | publisher = Philipp von Zabern | year = 2001 | pages = 55, 59 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (the beneficiary)

The title ''sukkal mu'erru'' suggests his rȏle is as a representative or liaison officer at the royal court on behalf of the military commander, or ''mu'erru''.&lt;ref&gt;''mu'irru'' CAD m 2, p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt;

The officials conducting the transfer:

* Ibni-Marduk, "son of Arad-Ea," ''šādid eqli'', the surveyor 
* Šamaš-muballiṭ, ''ḫazannu'', mayor of Bīt-Pir’i-Amurru or possibly its (chief) magistrate&lt;ref&gt;''ḫazannu'' CAD ḫ, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Bau-aḫu-iddina, ''ṭupšar šakin māti'', the scribe to the "ruler of the land," probably a provincial governor 
* Itti-Marduk-balāṭu, ''ša rēš šarri'' (&lt;sup&gt;lú&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;SAG LUGAL&lt;/small&gt;), the king's representative, a servant

The witnesses to the transaction:

* Iddina-Marduk, ''šakkanak māt tāmtim bīt-Mallaḫi'', a governor of a province in the Sealand, southern Mesopotamia
* Rizi ... ni (a Kassite), ''kartappu'' (&lt;sup&gt;lú&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;KA.DIB&lt;/small&gt;), the chariot commander&lt;ref name=sassmannshausen/&gt;
* Libur-zanin-Ekur, ''ša rēši'' (&lt;sup&gt;lú&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;SAG&lt;/small&gt;), a court official
* Lūṣa-ana-nūri-Marduk, ''sukkallu ṣīru'', grand vizier or first-rank courtier
* Iqīša-Bau, "son of Arad-Ea," role unknown
* Šamaš-šum-lišir, son of Atta-iluma, ''šakkanak Agade''. mayor of the city of Agade
* Kidin-Marduk, (&lt;sup&gt;lú&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[MEŠ (cuneiform)|MEŠ]].[[GAL (cuneiform)|GAL]]&lt;/small&gt;), high official&lt;sup&gt;?&lt;/sup&gt;

The term ''ša rēši'' designated a royal eunuch in the [[Assyria]]n court but there is no evidence of a similar fate for a court official in middle Babylonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title = A Political History of post-Kassite Babylonia, 1158-722 B.C. (AnOr. 43) | author = J. A. Brinkman | publisher = Pontificium Institutum Biblicum | year = 1968 | pages = 309–311 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, [[Kidin-Marduk]] (not the witness on this kudurru), an official with this title is pictured bearded having inherited the position from his father, and later bequeathing it to his son, on a [[cylinder seal]] of the reign of [[Burna-Buriash II|Burna-Buriaš II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title = Gilgamesh and the World of Assyria: Proceedings of the Conference Held at the Mandelbaum House, The University of Sydney, 21-23 July 2004 | chapter = A re-examination of the title ''ŠA REŠI'' in the Neo-Assyrian period | author = L. R. Siddal | editor = Joseph Azize, N. Weeks | publisher = Peeters Publishers | year = 2007 | pages = 225–226 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is significant that both the military positions are occupied by Kassites.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6104">In [[particle physics]], the '''lightest supersymmetric particle''' ('''LSP''') is the generic name given to the lightest of the additional hypothetical particles found in [[Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model|supersymmetric models]]. In models with [[R-parity]] conservation, the LSP is stable; in other words, the LSP cannot decay into any [[Standard Model]] particle, since all SM particles have the [[additive inverse|opposite]] R-parity. There is extensive observational evidence for an additional component of the matter density in the Universe that goes under the name [[dark matter]]. The LSP of supersymmetric models is a dark matter candidate and is a [[weakly interacting massive particle]] (WIMP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Jungman, Gerard |author2=Kamionkowski, Marc |author3=Griest, Kim | title=Supersymmetric dark matter |volume=267 |issue=5–6 |pages=195–373 |journal=Phys. Rep. |doi=10.1016/0370-1573(95)00058-5|arxiv = hep-ph/9506380 |bibcode = 1996PhR...267..195J |year=1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constraints on LSP from cosmology==
The LSP is unlikely to be a charged [[Gaugino|wino]], charged [[higgsino]], [[slepton]],
[[sneutrino]], [[gluino]], [[squark]], or [[gravitino]] but is most likely a mixture of neutral higgsinos, the [[gaugino|bino]] and the neutral [[gaugino|winos]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ellis, John R. | author2=Hagelin, J.S.| author3=Nanopoulos, Dimitri V. |author4=Olive, Keith A.| author5=Srednicki, M. |date=July 1983 | title=Supersymmetric Relics from the Big Bang|volume=B238 | issue=2|pages=453–476 |journal=Nucl. Phys. |doi=10.1016/0550-3213(84)90461-9 |bibcode = 1984NuPhB.238..453E }}&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. a [[neutralino]]. In particular, if the LSP were charged (and is abundant in our galaxy) such particles would have been captured by the Earth's magnetic field and form heavy hydrogen-like atoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=hep-ph/0202252|last1=Byrne|first1=Mark|title=Bounds on Charged, Stable Superpartners from Cosmic Ray Production|journal=Physical Review D|volume=66|issue=7|pages=075007|last2=Kolda|first2=Christopher|last3=Regan|first3=Peter|date=2002|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.66.075007|bibcode = 2002PhRvD..66g5007B |citeseerx=10.1.1.348.1389}}&lt;/ref&gt; Searches for anomalous hydrogen in natural water&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Phys. |doi=10.1016/0550-3213(82)90271-1 |bibcode = 1982NuPhB.206..333S }}&lt;/ref&gt; however have been without any evidence for such particles and thus put severe constraints on the existence of a charged LSP.

==Lightest Supersymmetric Particle as a dark matter candidate==
Dark matter particles must be electrically neutral; otherwise they would scatter light and thus not be "dark". They must also almost certainly be non-[[Color charge|colored]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=McGuire |first=Patrick C. |last2=Steinhardt |first2=Paul |date=May 2001 |title=Cracking open the window for strongly interacting massive particles as the halo dark matter |arxiv=astro-ph/0105567 |bibcode=2001ICRC....4.1566M |volume=4 |pages=1566 |journal=Proceedings of the 27th International Cosmic Ray Conference. 07-15 August}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
With these constraints, the LSP could be the lightest [[neutralino]], the [[gravitino]], or the lightest [[sneutrino]].

*''Sneutrino dark matter'' is ruled out in the [[Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model]] (MSSM) because of the current limits on the interaction cross section of dark matter particles with ordinary matter as measured by direct detection experiments—the sneutrino interacts via [[Z boson]] exchange and would have been detected by now if it makes up the dark matter. Extended models with right-handed or sterile sneutrinos reopen the possibility of sneutrino dark matter by lowering the interaction cross section.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tucker-Smith |first= David. |author2=Weiner, Neal |date=February 2004 |title=The Status of inelastic dark matter |arxiv= hep-ph/0402065|bibcode = 2005PhRvD..72f3509T |doi = 10.1103/PhysRevD.72.063509 |journal=Physical Review D |volume=72 |issue=6 |pages= 063509 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Neutralino dark matter'' is the favored possibility. In most models the lightest neutralino is mostly [[Gaugino|bino]] (superpartner of the [[weak hypercharge|hypercharge]] [[gauge boson]] field B), with some admixture of neutral [[Gaugino|wino]] (superpartner of the [[weak isospin]] gauge boson field W&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;) and/or neutral [[Higgsino]].
*''Gravitino dark matter'' is a possibility in supersymmetric models in which the scale of supersymmetry breaking is low, around 100 [[TeV]]. In such models the gravitino is very light, of order an [[Electronvolt|eV]]. As dark matter, the gravitino is sometimes called a super-WIMP because its interaction strength is much weaker than that of other supersymmetric dark matter candidates. For the same reason, its direct thermal production in the early universe is too inefficient to account for the observed dark matter abundance. Rather, gravitinos would have to be produced through the decay of the next-to-lightest supersymmetric particle (NLSP).

In [[Extra dimensions|extra-dimensional theories]], there are analogous particles called ''LKP''s or ''Lightest Kaluza-Klein Particle''. These are the stable particles of extra-dimensional theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Servant |first= Geraldine. |author2=Tait, Tim M.P. |date=September 2003 |title=Is the Lightest Kaluza-Klein Particle a Viable Dark Matter Candidate? |arxiv= hep-ph/0206071|bibcode = 2003NuPhB.650..391S |doi = 10.1016/S0550-3213(02)01012-X |journal=Nuclear Physics B |volume=650 |issue= 1–2 |pages=391–419 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29190">{{About|industrial lubricants}}
A '''lubricant''' is a substance, usually [[Organic compound|organic]], introduced to reduce [[friction]] between surfaces in mutual contact, which ultimately reduces the heat generated when the surfaces move. It may also have the function of transmitting forces, transporting foreign particles, or heating or cooling the surfaces. The property of reducing friction is known as [[lubricity]].

In addition to industrial applications, lubricants are used for many other purposes. Other uses include cooking ([[oil]]s and [[fat]]s in use in [[frying pan]]s, in baking to prevent food sticking), bioapplications on humans (e.g. lubricants for [[Replacement joint|artificial joint]]s), ultrasound examination, medical examination.

==History==
Lubicants have been in some use for thousands of years.  [[Calcium soaps]] have been identified on the axles of chariots dated to 1400 BC.  Building stones were slid on oil-impregrated lumber in the time of the pyramids. In the Roman era, lubricants were based on [[olive oil]] and [[rapeseed oil]], as well as animal fats. The growth of lubrication accelerated in the [[Industrial Revolution]] with the accompanying use of metal-based machinery.  Relying initially on natural oils, needs for such machinery shifted toward petroleum-based materials early in the 1900s.  A breakthrough came with the development of [[vacuum distillation]] of petroleum, as described by the [[Vacuum Oil Company]]. This technology allowed the purification of very nonvolatile substances, which are common in many lubricants.&lt;ref name=Fundamentals&gt;{{cite book|title=Lubrication Fundamentals|edition=Third Edition, Revised and Expanded|author1=Don M. Pirro|author2=Martin Webster|author3=Ekkehard Daschner|publisher=CRC Press|year= 2016|isbn=978-1-4987-5290-9}} (print) {{ISBN|978-1-4987-5291-6}} (eBook)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Properties ==

A good lubricant generally possesses the following characteristics:
* A high boiling point and low freezing point (in order to stay [[liquid]] within a wide range of temperature)
* A high [[viscosity index]]
* Thermal stability
* Hydraulic stability
* Demulsibility
* Corrosion prevention
* A high resistance to [[oxidation]]

=== Formulation ===

Typically lubricants contain 90% base oil (most often [[petroleum]] fractions, called [[mineral oil]]s) and less than 10% [[Oil additive|additives]]. [[Vegetable oil]]s or synthetic liquids such as hydrogenated [[polyolefin]]s, [[ester]]s, [[silicone]]s, [[fluorocarbon]]s and many others are sometimes used as base oils. Additives deliver reduced friction and wear, increased [[viscosity]], improved viscosity index, resistance to [[corrosion]] and [[oxidation]], aging or contamination, etc.

Non-liquid lubricants include powders (dry [[graphite]], [[polytetrafluoroethylene|PTFE]], [[molybdenum disulphide]], [[tungsten disulphide]], etc.), PTFE tape used in plumbing, air cushion and others. [[Dry lubricant]]s such as graphite, molybdenum disulphide and tungsten disulphide also offer lubrication at temperatures (up to 350&amp;nbsp;°C) higher than liquid and oil-based lubricants are able to operate.  Limited interest has been shown in low friction properties of [[compacted oxide glaze layer]]s formed at several hundred degrees Celsius in metallic sliding systems, however, practical use is still many years away due to their physically unstable nature.

=== Additives ===

{{main article|Oil additive}}

A large number of additives are used to impart performance characteristics to the lubricants. Modern automotive lubricants contain as many as ten additives, comprising up to 20% of the lubricant, the main families of additives are:&lt;ref name=Fundamentals/&gt;
* [[Pour point]] depressants are compounds that prevent crystallization of waxes. Long chain [[alkylbenzene]]s adhere to small crystallites of wax, preventing crystal growth.
* [[Anti-foaming agent]]s are typically [[silicone]] compounds which lower [[surface tension]] in order to discourage foam formation.
* [[Viscosity index improver]]s (VIIs) are compounds that allow lubricants to remain viscous at higher temperatures. Typical VIIs are [[polyacrylate]]s and [[butadiene]].
* [[Antioxidant]]s suppress the rate of oxidative degradation of the hydrocarbon molecules within the lubricant. At low temperatures, free radical inhibitors such as hindered phenols are used, e.g. [[butylated hydroxytoluene]]. At temperatures &gt;90&amp;nbsp;°C, where the metals [[Catalysis|catalyze]] the oxidation process, dithiophosphates are more useful. In the latter application the additives are called [[metal deactivator]]s.
* [[Detergent]]s ensure the cleanliness of engine components by preventing the formation of deposits on contact surfaces at high temperatures.
* [[Corrosion inhibitor]]s (rust inhibitors) are usually alkaline materials, such as alkylsulfonate salts, that absorb acids that would corrode metal parts.
* [[AW additive|Anti-wear]] additives form protective 'tribofilms' on metal parts, suppressing [[wear]]. They come in two classes depending on the strength with which they bind to the surface. Popular examples include [[tricresylphosphate|phosphate ester]]s and [[zinc dithiophosphate]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Spikes|first=H.|date=2004-10-01|title=The History and Mechanisms of ZDDP|journal=Tribology Letters|language=en|volume=17|issue=3|pages=469–489|doi=10.1023/B:TRIL.0000044495.26882.b5|issn=1023-8883}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that many of the basic chemical compounds used as detergents (example: calcium sulfonate) serve the purpose of the first seven items in the list as well.

Grease lubricants may contain large amount of solid particle friction modifiers, such as graphite, molybdenum sulfide.--&gt;

== Types of lubricants ==

In 1999, an estimated 37,300,000 tons of lubricants were consumed worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |doi=10.1002/14356007.a15_423|chapter=Lubricants and Lubrication|title=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|year=2003|last1=Bartels|first1=Thorsten|last2=Bock|first2=Wolfgang|last3=Braun|first3=Jürgen|last4=Busch|first4=Christian|last5=Buss|first5=Wolfgang|last6=Dresel|first6=Wilfried|last7=Freiler|first7=Carmen|last8=Harperscheid|first8=Manfred|last9=Heckler|first9=Rolf-Peter|last10=Hörner|first10=Dietrich|last11=Kubicki|first11=Franz|last12=Lingg|first12=Georg|last13=Losch|first13=Achim|last14=Luther|first14=Rolf|last15=Mang|first15=Theo|last16=Noll|first16=Siegfried|last17=Omeis|first17=Jürgen|isbn=978-3527306732}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Automotive applications dominate, but other industrial, marine, and metal working applications are also big consumers of lubricants.  Although air and other gas-based lubricants are known (e.g., in [[fluid bearing]]s), liquid lubricants dominate the market, followed by solid lubricants.

Lubricants are generally composed of a majority of base [[oil]] plus a variety of additives to impart desirable characteristics. Although generally lubricants are based on one type of base oil, mixtures of the base oils also are used to meet performance requirements.

=== Mineral oil ===

The term "mineral oil" is used to refer to lubricating base oils derived from [[crude oil]]. The [[American Petroleum Institute]] (API) designates several types of lubricant base oil:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.api.org/certifications/engineoil/pubs/index.cfm Engine Oil Publications]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Group I – Saturates &lt; 90% and/or [[sulfur]] &gt; 0.03%, and [[Society of Automotive Engineers]] (SAE) [[viscosity index]] (VI) of 80 to 120
: Manufactured by solvent extraction, solvent or catalytic dewaxing, and hydro-finishing processes. Common Group I base oil are 150SN (solvent neutral), 500SN, and 150BS (brightstock)
* Group II – Saturates &gt; 90% and sulfur &lt; 0.03%, and SAE viscosity index of 80 to 120
: Manufactured by hydrocracking and solvent or catalytic dewaxing processes. Group II base oil has superior anti-oxidation properties since virtually all hydrocarbon molecules are saturated. It has water-white color.
* Group III – Saturates &gt; 90%, sulfur &lt; 0.03%, and SAE viscosity index over 120
: Manufactured by special processes such as isohydromerization. Can be manufactured from base oil or slax wax from dewaxing process.
* Group IV 3 b– [[Polyalphaolefins]] (PAO)
* Group V – All others not included above such as naphthenics, PAG,  l 80[[ester]]s.

The lubricant industry commonly extends this group terminology to include:
* Group I+ with a [[viscosity index]] of 103–108
* Group II+ with a viscosity index of 113–119
* Group III+ with a viscosity index of at least 140

Can also be classified into three categories depending on the prevailing compositions:
* Paraffinic
* Naphthenic
* Aromatic

=== Synthetic oils ===
Petroleum-derived lubricant can also be produced using synthetic hydrocarbons (derived ultimately from petroleum).  These include:
* [[Polyalpha-olefin]] (PAO)
* Synthetic [[esters]]
* [[Polyalkylene glycols]] (PAG)
* [[Phosphate ester]]s
* [[Alkylated naphthalenes]] (AN)
* [[Silicate esters]]
* [[Ionic fluids]]
* [[Multiply alkylated cyclopentanes]] (MAC)

=== Solid lubricants ===
{{main article|Dry lubricant}}

'''PTFE:''' [[polytetrafluoroethylene]] (PTFE) is typically used as a coating layer on, for example, cooking utensils to provide a non-stick surface. Its usable temperature range up to 350&amp;nbsp;°C and chemical inertness make it a useful additive in special greases. Under extreme pressures, PTFE powder or solids is of little value as it is soft and flows away from the area of contact. Ceramic or metal or alloy lubricants must be used then.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Historical developments and new trends in tribological and solid lubricant coatings
|author1=Donnet, C.|author2=Erdemir, A.|journal=Surface and Coatings Technology|year=2004|volume=180-181|pages=76–84|doi=10.1016/j.surfcoat.2003.10.022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Inorganic solids:''' [[Graphite]], hexagonal [[boron nitride]], [[molybdenum disulfide]] and [[tungsten disulfide]] are examples of [[solid lubricant]]s.  Some retain their lubricity to very high temperatures. The use of some such materials is sometimes restricted by their poor resistance to oxidation (e.g., molybdenum disulfide degrades above 350&amp;nbsp;°C in air, but 1100&amp;nbsp;°C in reducing environments.

'''Metal/alloy:''' Metal alloys, composites and pure metals can be used as grease additives or the sole constituents of sliding surfaces and bearings. [[Cadmium]] and g[[Gold|old]] are used for plating surfaces which gives them good corrosion resistance and sliding properties, [[Lead]], [[tin]], [[zinc]] alloys and various [[bronze]] alloys are used as sliding bearings, or their powder can be used to lubricate sliding surfaces alone.

=== Aqueous lubrication ===
Aqueous lubrication is of interest in a number of technological applications. Strongly hydrated [[Polymer brush|brush polymer]]s such as PEG can serve as lubricants at liquid solid interfaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/7l283620353453pk/ | doi=10.1007/s11249-009-9549-9| title=Macrotribological Studies of Poly(L-lysine)-graft-Poly(ethylene glycol) in Aqueous Glycerol Mixtures| journal=Tribology Letters| volume=37| issue=3| pages=541–552| year=2010| last1=Nalam| first1=Prathima C.| last2=Clasohm| first2=Jarred N.| last3=Mashaghi| first3=Alireza| last4=Spencer| first4=Nicholas D.}}&lt;/ref&gt; By continuous rapid exchange of bound water with other free water molecules, these polymer films keep the surfaces separated while maintaining a high fluidity at the brush–brush interface at high compressions, thus leading to a very low coefficient of friction.

=== Bio - Lubricants ===
Biolubricants are derived from vegetable oils and other renewable sources.  They usually are [[triglyceride]] esters (fats obtained from plants and animals. For lubricant base oil use, the vegetable derived materials are preferred. Common ones include high oleic [[canola oil]], [[castor oil]], [[palm oil]], [[sunflower seed oil]] and [[rapeseed oil]] from vegetable, and [[tall oil]] from tree sources. Many vegetable oils are often hydrolyzed to yield the acids which are subsequently combined selectively to form specialist synthetic esters.  Other naturally derived lubricants include [[lanolin]] (wool grease, a natural water repellent).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Biolubricants: raw materials, chemical modifications and environmental benefits|author1=Salimon, Jumat|author2=Salih, Nadia|author3=Yousif, Emad

[[Whale oil]] was a historically important lubricant, with some uses up to the latter part of the 20th century as a friction modifier [[oil additive|additive]] for [[automatic transmission fluid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=buwQ8a2RCUcC&amp;lpg=PA20&amp;dq=whale%20oil%20dexron&amp;pg=PA20#v=onepage&amp;q=whale%20oil%20dexron&amp;f=false |page=20|title=The Turbo Hydra-Matic 350 Handbook|isbn=9780895860514|last1=Sessions|first1=Ron|year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the biolubricant market was around 1% of UK lubricant sales in a total lubricant market of 840,000 tonnes/year.&lt;ref&gt;[[National Non-Food Crops Centre]].

== Functions of lubricants ==
One of the single largest applications for lubricants, in the form of [[motor oil]], is protecting the [[internal combustion engine]]s in motor vehicles and powered equipment.
&lt;!--Lubricants such as [[2-cycle oil]] are added to [[fuel]]s like gasoline, which has low lubricity. [[Sulfur]] impurities in fuels also provide some lubrication properties, which is absent in low-sulfur [[Diesel fuel|diesel]]. [[Biodiesel]] is a popular diesel fuel additive providing lubricity.

Another approach to reducing friction and wear is to use [[bearing (mechanical)|bearings]] such as [[ball bearing]]s, [[roller bearing]]s or [[air bearing]]s, which in turn require internal lubrication themselves, or to use sound, in the case of [[acoustic lubrication]].--&gt;
=== Lubricant vs. Anti-tack Coating ===
'''Anti-tack or anti-stick coatings''' are designed to reduce the adhesive condition (stickiness) of a given material. The rubber, hose, and wire and cable industries are the largest consumers of anti-tack products but virtually every industry uses some form of anti-sticking agent. Anti-sticking agents differ from ''lubricants'' in that they are designed to reduce the inherently adhesive qualities of a given compound while lubricants are designed to reduce friction between any two surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mclube.com/products/anti-tack-processing-aids/|title=Powder-free Anti-tack Processing Aids For Rubber Parts and Materials|work=McLube Release Agents &amp; Lubricants|access-date=2018-03-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Keep moving parts apart ===
Lubricants are typically used to separate [[moving parts]] in a system. This separation has the benefit of reducing friction, wear and surface fatigue, together with reduced heat generation, operating noise and vibrations. Lubricants achieve this in several ways. The most common is by forming a physical barrier i.e., a thin layer of lubricant separates the moving parts. This is analogous to hydroplaning, the loss of friction observed when a car tire is separated from the road surface by moving through standing water. This is termed hydrodynamic lubrication. In cases of high surface pressures or temperatures, the fluid film is much thinner and some of the forces are transmitted between the surfaces through the lubricant..

=== Reduce friction ===
Typically the lubricant-to-surface [[friction]] is much less than surface-to-surface friction in a system without any lubrication. Thus use of a lubricant reduces the overall system friction. Reduced friction has the benefit of reducing heat generation and reduced formation of wear particles as well as improved efficiency. Lubricants may contain [[oil additive|additives]] known as friction modifiers that chemically bind to metal surfaces to reduce surface friction even when there is insufficient bulk lubricant present for hydrodynamic lubrication, e.g. protecting the valve train in a car engine at startup.

=== Transfer heat ===
Both gas and liquid lubricants can transfer heat. However, liquid lubricants are much more effective on account of their high specific [[heat capacity]]. Typically the liquid lubricant is constantly circulated to and from a cooler part of the system, although lubricants may be used to warm as well as to cool when a regulated temperature is required. This circulating flow also determines the amount of heat that is carried away in any given unit of time. High flow systems can carry away a lot of heat and have the additional benefit of reducing the thermal stress on the lubricant. Thus lower cost liquid lubricants may be used. The primary drawback is that high flows typically require larger sumps and bigger cooling units. A secondary drawback is that a high flow system that relies on the flow rate to protect the lubricant from thermal stress is susceptible to catastrophic failure during sudden system shut downs. An automotive oil-cooled [[turbocharger]] is a typical example. Turbochargers get red hot during operation and the oil that is cooling them only survives as its residence time in the system is very short (i.e. high flow rate). If the system is shut down suddenly (pulling into a service area after a high-speed drive and stopping the engine) the oil that is in the turbo charger immediately oxidizes and will clog the oil ways with deposits. Over time these deposits can completely block the oil ways, reducing the cooling with the result that the turbo charger experiences total failure, typically with seized [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearings]]. Non-flowing lubricants such as greases and pastes are not effective at heat transfer although they do contribute by reducing the generation of heat in the first place.

=== Carry away contaminants and debris ===

Lubricant circulation systems have the benefit of carrying away internally generated debris and external contaminants that get introduced into the system to a filter where they can be removed. Lubricants for machines that regularly generate debris or contaminants such as automotive engines typically contain detergent and dispersant additives to assist in debris and contaminant transport to the filter and removal. Over time the filter will get clogged and require cleaning or replacement, hence the recommendation to change a car's oil filter at the same time as changing the oil. In closed systems such as gear boxes the filter may be supplemented by a magnet to attract any iron fines that get created.

It is apparent that in a circulatory system the oil will only be as clean as the filter can make it, thus it is unfortunate that there are no industry standards by which consumers can readily assess the filtering ability of various automotive filters. Poor automotive filters 
significantly reduces the life of the machine (engine) as well as making the system inefficient.

=== Transmit power ===

{{main article|Hydraulics}}

Lubricants known as [[hydraulic fluid]] are used as the [[working fluid]] in hydrostatic power transmission. Hydraulic fluids comprise a large portion of all lubricants produced in the world. The [[automatic transmission]]'s [[torque converter]] is another important application for power transmission with lubricants.

=== Protect against wear ===

Lubricants prevent wear by keeping the moving parts apart. Lubricants may also contain anti-wear or extreme pressure additives to boost their performance against wear and fatigue.

=== Prevent corrosion ===
Many lubricants are formulated with additives that form chemical bonds with surfaces or that exclude moisture, to prevent corrosion and rust. It reduces corrosion between two metallic surface and avoids contact between these surfaces to avoid immersed corrosion.

=== Seal for gases ===
Lubricants will occupy the clearance between moving parts through the capillary force, thus sealing the clearance. This effect can be used to seal pistons and shafts.

&lt;!--== Other relevant phenomena ==
--&gt;
== "Glaze" formation (high temperature wear) ==

A further phenomenon that has undergone investigation in relation to high temperature wear prevention and lubrication, is that of a [[compacted oxide layer glaze]] formation. Such glazes are generated by sintering a compacted oxide layer.  Such glazes are crystalline, in contrast to the amorphous glazes seen in pottery.  The required high temperatures arise from metallic surfaces sliding against each other (or a metallic surface against a ceramic surface).   Due to the elimination of metallic contact and adhesion by the generation of oxide, friction and wear is reduced.   Effectively, such a surface is self-lubricating.

As the "glaze" is already an oxide, it can survive to very high temperatures in air or oxidising environments. However, it is disadvantaged by it being necessary for the base metal (or ceramic) having to undergo some wear first to generate sufficient oxide debris.

== Disposal and environmental impact  ==

It is estimated that 40% of all lubricants are released into the environment. Common disposal methods include [[recycling]], [[burning]], [[landfill]] and discharge into water, though typically disposal in landfill and discharge into water are strictly regulated in most countries, as even small amount of lubricant can contaminate a large amount of water. Most regulations permit a threshold level of lubricant that may be present in waste streams and companies spend hundreds of millions of dollars annually in treating their waste waters to get to acceptable levels.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Burning the lubricant as fuel, typically to generate electricity, is also governed by regulations mainly on account of the relatively high level of additives present. Burning generates both airborne pollutants and ash rich in toxic materials, mainly heavy metal compounds. Thus lubricant burning takes place in specialized facilities that have incorporated special scrubbers to remove airborne pollutants and have access to landfill sites with permits to handle the toxic ash.

Unfortunately, most lubricant that ends up directly in the environment is due to general public discharging it onto the ground, into drains and directly into landfills as trash. Other direct contamination sources include runoff from roadways, accidental spillages, natural or man-made disasters and pipeline leakages.

Improvement in filtration technologies and processes has now made recycling a viable option (with rising price of base stock and [[crude oil]]). Typically various filtration systems remove particulates, additives and oxidation products and recover the base oil. The oil may get refined during the process. This base oil is then treated much the same as virgin base oil however there is considerable reluctance to use recycled oils as they are generally considered inferior. Basestock fractionally vacuum distilled from used lubricants has superior properties to all natural oils, but cost effectiveness depends on many factors. Used lubricant may also be used as refinery feedstock to become part of crude oil. Again, there is considerable reluctance to this use as the additives, soot and wear metals will seriously poison/deactivate the critical catalysts in the process. Cost prohibits carrying out both filtration (soot, additives removal) and re-refining ([[distilling]], isomerisation, hydrocrack, etc.) however the primary hindrance to recycling still remains the collection of fluids as refineries need continuous supply in amounts measured in cisterns, rail tanks.

Occasionally, unused lubricant requires disposal. The best course of action in such situations is to return it to the manufacturer where it can be processed as a part of fresh batches.

''Environment:''
Lubricants both fresh and used can cause considerable damage to the environment mainly due to their high potential of serious water pollution. Further the additives typically contained in lubricant can be toxic to flora and fauna. In used fluids the oxidation products can be toxic as well. Lubricant persistence in the environment largely depends upon the base fluid, however if very toxic additives are used they may negatively affect the persistence. [[Lanolin]] lubricants are non-toxic making them the environmental alternative which is safe for both users and the environment.

The neon sign is an evolution of the earlier [[Geissler tube]], which is a broken glass tube containing a "rarefied" gas (the gas pressure in the tube is well below [[atmospheric pressure]]). When a voltage is applied to electrodes inserted through the glass, an electrical [[glow discharge]] results. Geissler tubes were quite popular in the late 19th century, and the different colors they emitted were characteristics of the gases within. They were, however, unsuitable for general lighting; the pressure of the gas inside typically declined in use. The direct predecessor of neon tube lighting was the [[Moore tube]], which used nitrogen or carbon dioxide as the luminous gas and a patented mechanism for maintaining pressure; Moore tubes were sold for commercial lighting for a number of years in the early 1900s.&lt;ref name=SI&gt;{{cite web |title=Lamp Inventors 1880–1940: Moore Lamp |publisher=The Smithsonian Institution |url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/lighting/bios/moore.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Claude1913&gt;{{cite journal |last=Claude |first=Georges |title=The Development of Neon Tubes |journal=The Engineering Magazine |date=November 1913 |pages=271–274 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=erpMAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA271}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--Unlikely claim, left here to preserve the reference: The first commercial sign may have been the [[Highlander]] sign erected on Dewar's Wharf in 1897, to promote Dewar's [[Scotch whisky]].&lt;ref&gt;Scotch Whisky, A Liquid History, Charles McClean, p6 144&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

The discovery of neon in 1898 by the British  scientists [[William Ramsay]] and [[Morris W.

However, after 1902, [[Georges Claude]]'s company in France, [[Air Liquide]], began producing industrial quantities of neon, essentially as a byproduct of their air liquefaction business.&lt;ref name=Claude1913 /&gt; From December 3–18, 1910, Claude demonstrated two {{convert|12|m|ft|adj=on}} long bright red neon tubes at the [[Paris Motor Show]].&lt;ref name=vanDulken /&gt;&lt;ref name=MB&gt;The dates of the show are listed at {{cite web |url=http://et.mercedes-benz-clubs.com/mediawiki/index.php/Chronik_1901_-_1910/en |title=Chronik 1901 – 1910/en |publisher=Mercedes Benz}}&lt;/ref&gt; This demonstration lit a [[peristyle]] of the ''[[Grand Palais]]'' (a large exhibition hall).&lt;ref name=Testelin&gt;{{cite web |title=Reportage – Il était une fois le néon No. 402 |last=Testelin |first=Xavier |url=http://www.xaviertestelin.com/photo-402.html |accessdate=2010-12-06 }} Claude's 1910 demonstration of neon lighting lit the peristyle of the ''[[Grand Palais]]'' in Paris; this webpage includes a contemporary photograph that gives an impression of it. It is part of an extensive selection of images of neon lighting; see {{cite web |title=Reportage – Il était une fois le néon |url=http://www.xaviertestelin.com/sujet-6.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Claude's associate, Jacques Fonsèque, realized the possibilities for a business based on signage and advertising. By 1913 a large sign for the vermouth [[Cinzano]] illuminated the night sky in Paris, and by 1919 the entrance to the [[Paris Opera]] was adorned with neon tube lighting.&lt;ref name=Stern /&gt; Over the next several years, patents were granted to Claude for two innovations still used today: a "bombardment" technique to remove impurities from the working gas of a sealed sign, and a design for the internal [[electrodes]] of the sign that prevented their degradation by sputtering.&lt;ref name=Claude1913 /&gt;

In 1923, Georges Claude and his French company Claude Neon introduced neon gas signs to the United States by selling two to a [[Packard]] car dealership in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]. [[Earle C. Anthony]] purchased the two signs reading "Packard" for $1,250 apiece.&lt;ref name=vanDulken /&gt; Neon lighting quickly became a popular fixture in outdoor advertising. Visible even in daylight, people would stop and stare at the first neon signs for hours, dubbed "liquid fire."&lt;ref&gt;These anecdotes and the phrase "liquid fire" are often used in references discussing the first neon tube lights in Los Angeles, but the primary source is not provided. One example of a typical, tertiary reference is {{cite web |last=Bellis |first=Mary |year= |url=http://inventors.about.com/library/weekly/aa980107.htm |title=The History of Neon Signs: Georges Claude and Liquid Fire |work=about.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What may be the oldest surviving neon  sign in the United States, still in use for its original purpose, is the sign “Theatre” (1929) at the [[Lake Worth Playhouse]] in [[Lake Worth, Florida]].

The next major technological innovation in neon lighting and signs was the development of fluorescent tube coatings. Jacques Risler received a French patent in 1926 for these.&lt;ref name=Bright /&gt; Neon signs that use an argon/mercury gas mixture emit a good deal of [[ultraviolet light]]. When this light is absorbed by a fluorescent coating, preferably inside the tube, the coating (called a "phosphor") glows with its own color. While only a few colors were initially available to sign designers, after the [[World War II|Second World War]], phosphor materials were researched intensively for use in color televisions. About two dozen colors were available to neon sign designers by the 1960s, and today there are nearly 100 available colors.&lt;ref name=Thielen /&gt;

are produced by the craft of bending [[glass]] tubing into shapes. A worker skilled in this craft is known as a glass bender, neon bender or tube bender. The neon tube is made out of 4 or 5-foot long straight sticks of hollow glass sold by sign suppliers to neon shops worldwide, where they are manually assembled into individual custom designed and fabricated lamps.

Tubing in external diameters ranging from about 8–15&amp;nbsp;mm with a 1&amp;nbsp;mm wall thickness is most commonly used, although 6&amp;nbsp;mm tubing is now commercially available in colored glass tubes. The tube is heated in sections using several types of burners that are selected according to the amount of glass to be heated for each bend. These burners include ribbon, cannon, or crossfires, as well as a variety of  gas torches. Ribbon burners are strips of fire that make the gradual bends, while crossfires are used to make sharp bends.

The interior of the tubes may be coated with a thin phosphorescent powder coating, affixed to the interior wall of the tube by a binding material. The tube is filled with a purified gas mixture, and the gas ionized by a high voltage applied between the ends of the sealed tube through cold cathodes welded onto the ends. The color of the [[light]] emitted by the tube may be just that coming from the gas, or the light from the [[phosphor]] layer. Different phosphor-coated tubing sections may be butt welded together using glass working torches to form a single tube of varying colors, for effects such as a sign where each letter displays a different color letter within a single word.

"Neon" is used to denote the general type of lamp, but neon gas is only one of the types of tube gases principally used in commercial application.  Pure neon gas is used to produce only about one-third of the colors (mostly shades of [[red]] and [[orange (color)|orange]], and some warmer or more intense shades of [[pink]]). The greatest number of colors (including all shades of [[blue]], [[yellow]], [[green]], [[violet (color)|violet]], and [[white]], as well as some cooler or softer shades of pink) produced by filling with another inert gas, argon, and a drop of mercury (Hg) which is added to the tube immediately after purification. When the tube is ionized by electrification, the mercury evaporates into mercury vapor, which fills the tube and produces strong ultraviolet light.  The ultraviolet light thus produced excites the various phosphor coatings designed to produce different colors.  Even though this class of neon tubes use no neon at all, they are still denoted as "neon."  Mercury-bearing lamps are a type of cold-cathode [[fluorescent lamp]]s.

Each type of neon tubing produces two different possible colors, one with neon gas and the other with argon/mercury. Some "neon" tubes are made without phosphor coatings for some of the colors.  Clear tubing filled with neon gas produces the ubiquitous yellowish orange color with the interior plasma column clearly visible, and is the cheapest and simplest tube to make. Traditional neon glasses in America over 20 years old are lead glass that are easy to soften in gas fires, but recent environmental and health concerns of the workers has prompted manufacturers to seek more environmentally safe special soft glass formulas. One of the vexing problems avoided this way is lead glass' tendency to burn into a black spot emitting lead fumes in a bending flame too rich in the fuel/oxygen mixture.  Another traditional line of glasses was colored soda lime glasses coming in a myriad of glass color choices, which produce the highest quality, most hypnotically vibrant and saturated hues. Still more color choices are afforded in either coating, or not coating, these colored glasses with the various available exotic phosphors.

===Long lifetime===
{{noreferences|1=section|date=November 2018}}
It is the wide range of colors and the ability to make a tube that can last for years or decades without replacement, that makes this an art. Since these tubes require so much custom labor, they would have very little economic viability if they did not have such a long lifetime when well processed. The intensity of neon light produced increases as the tube diameter grows smaller, that is, the intensity varies inversely with the square root of the interior diameter of the tubing, and the resistance of the tube increases as the tubing diameter decreases accordingly, because tube ionization is greatest at the center of the tube, and the ions migrate to and are recaptured and neutralized at the tube walls. The greatest cause of neon tube failure is the gradual absorption of neon gas by high voltage ion implantation into the interior glass walls of the tubes which depletes the gas, and eventually causes the tube resistance to rise to a level that it can no longer light at the rated voltage, but this may take well over 50 years if the tube is properly processed during bombardment and gas back-filling.

This long lifetime has created a practical market for neon use for interior [[Cove lighting|architectural cove lighting]] in a wide variety of uses including homes, where the tube can be bent to any shape, fitted in a small space, and can do so without requiring tube replacement for a decade or more.

===Tube bending===
{{noreferences|1=section|date=November 2018}}
A section of the glass is heated until it is malleable; then it is bent into shape and aligned to a neon sign pattern paper containing the graphics or lettering to which the final product will conform.   A tube bender corks off the hollow tube before heating and holds a latex rubber blow hose at the other end, through which he gently presses a small amount of air to keep the tube diameter constant as it is bending. The trick of bending is to bend one small section or bend at a time, heating one part of the tubing so that it is soft, without heating some other part of the tube as well, which would make the bend uncontrollable. A bend, once the glass is heated, must be brought to the pattern and fitted rapidly before the glass hardens again, because it is difficult to reheat once completely cooled without risking breakage. It is frequently necessary to skip one or more bends and come back to it later, by measuring carefully along the length of the tube.  One tube letter may contain 7–10 small bends, and mistakes are not easily corrected without going back and starting all over again. If more tubing is required, another piece is welded onto it, or the parts can be all welded onto each other at the final step. The finished tube must be vacuum tight and clean inside in order to operate.  Once the tube is filled with mercury, if any mistake is made after that, the entire tube should be started over anew, because breathing heated mercury-impregnated glass and phosphor causes long term heavy metal poisoning in neon workers. Sticks of tubing are joined until the tube reaches an impractical size, and several tubes are joined in series with the high voltage neon transformer.  Extreme ends of the electrical circuit must be isolated from each other to prevent tube puncture and buzzing from [[Corona discharge|corona effect]].

===Bombardment===
{{noreferences|1=section|date=November 2018}}
A [[cold cathode]] [[electrode]] is melted (or [[welding|welded]]) to each end of the tube as it is finished. The [[Hollow cathode effect|hollow electrodes]] are also traditionally lead glass and contain a small metal shell with two wires protruding through the glass to which the sign wiring will later be attached. All welds and seals must be leak-proof at high vacuum before proceeding further.

The tube is attached to a manifold which is then attached to a high-quality [[vacuum]] pump. The tube is then evacuated of air until it reaches a vacuum level of a few [[torr]]. The evacuation is paused, and a high [[Electric current|current]] is forced through the low-pressure air in the tube via the electrodes (in a process known as "bombarding"). This current and voltage is far above the level that occurs in final operation of the tube.  The current depends on the specific electrodes used and the diameter of the tube but is typically in the 150 mA to 1,500 mA range, starting low and increasing towards the end of the process to ensure that the electrodes are adequately heated without melting the glass tube. The bombarding current is provided by a large transformer with an open-circuit voltage of roughly 15,000VAC to 23,000VAC. The bombarding transformer acts as an adjustable constant current source, and the actual voltage during operation depends on the length and pressure of the tube. Typically the operator will maintain the pressure as high as the bombarder will allow to ensure maximum power dissipation and heating. Bombarding transformers may be specially made for this use, or may be repurposed electrical utility distribution transformers (the type seen mounted on utility poles) operated backwards to produce a high voltage output.

This very high power dissipation in the tube heats the glass walls to a temperature of several hundred degrees Celsius, and any dirt and impurities within are drawn off in the gasified form by the vacuum pump.  The greatest impurities that are driven off this way are the gases that coat the inside wall of the tubing by [[adsorption]], mainly oxygen, carbon dioxide, and especially water vapor. The current also heats the electrode metal to over 600&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C, producing a bright orange incandescent color.  The cathodes are prefabricated hollow metal shells with a small opening (sometimes a ceramic donut aperture) which contains in the interior surface of the shell a light dusting of a cold cathode low work function powder (usually a powder ceramic molar [[eutectic point]] mixture including BaCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), combined with other alkaline earth oxides, which reduces to BaO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; when heated to about 500 degrees F, and reduces the [[work function]] of the electrode for cathodic emission. Barium Oxide has a work function of roughly 2 eV whereas tungsten at room temperature has a work function 100 times more, or 4.0 eV.  This represents the cathode drop or electron energy required to remove electrons from the surface of the cathode.  This avoids the necessity of using a hot wire thermoelectric cathode such as is used in conventional fluorescent lamps.  And for that reason, neon tubes are extremely long lived when properly processed, in contrast to fluorescent tubing, because there is no wire filament as there is in a fluorsecent tube to burn out like a common light bulb. The principal purpose of doing this is to purify the interior of the tube ''before'' the tube is sealed off so that when it is operated, these gases and impurities are not driven off and released by the plasma and the heat generated into the sealed tube, which would quickly burn the metal cathodes and mercury droplets (if pumped with argon/mercury) and oxidize the interior gases and cause immediate tube failure.  The more thorough the purification of the tube is, the longer lasting and stable the tube will be in actual operation. Once these gases and impurities are liberated under pre-filling bombardment into the tube interior they are quickly evacuated by the pump.

While still attached to the manifold, the tube is allowed to cool while pumping down to the lowest pressure the system can achieve.  It is then filled to a low pressure of a few [[torr]]s (millimeters of mercury) with one of the [[noble gases]], or a mixture of them, and sometimes a small amount of mercury. This gas fill pressure represents roughly 1/100th of the pressure of the atmosphere. The required pressure depends on the gas used and the diameter of the tube, with optimal values ranging from {{convert|6|torr|kPa|1|abbr=on}} (for a long 20&amp;nbsp;mm tube filled with argon/mercury) to {{convert|27|torr|kPa|abbr=on}} (for a short 8&amp;nbsp;mm diameter tube filled with pure neon).  [[Neon]] or [[argon]] are the most common gases used; [[krypton]], [[xenon]], and [[helium]] are used by artists for special purposes but are not used alone in normal signs.  A premixed combination of argon and helium is often used in lieu of pure argon when a tube is to be installed in a cold climate, since the helium increases voltage drop (and thus power dissipation), warming the tube to [[operating temperature]] faster. Neon glows bright red or reddish orange when lit. When argon or argon/helium is used, a tiny droplet of [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] is added. Argon by itself is very dim pale lavender when lit, but the droplet of mercury fills the tube with mercury vapor when sealed, which then emits [[ultraviolet]] light upon electrification. This ultraviolet emission allows finished argon/mercury tubes to glow with a variety of bright colors when the tube has been coated on the interior with ultraviolet-sensitive [[phosphor]]s after being bent into shape.

===Heat processed neon tubes===
{{noreferences|1=section|date=November 2018}}
An alternative way of processing finished neon tubes has also been used.  Because the only purpose of bombardment by electrical means is to purify the interior of tubes, it is also possible to produce a tube by heating the tube externally either with a torch or with an oven, while heating the electrode with a radio frequency induction heating (RFIH) coil.  While this is less productive, it creates a cleaner custom tube with significantly less cathode damage, longer life and brilliance, and can produce tubes of very small sizes and diameters, down to 6mm OD. The tube is heated thoroughly under high vacuum without external electrical application, until the outgassed gases can be seen to have been totally depleted and the pressure drops to a high vacuum again. Then the tube is filled, sealed and the mercury dropped and shaken.

===Electrical wiring===
{{refimprove|1=section|date=November 2018}}
The finished glass pieces are illuminated by either a [[neon sign transformer]] or a [[switched-mode power supply]], usually  running at voltages ranging between 2–15 kV and currents between 18 and 30 mA (higher currents available on special order.) &lt;ref&gt;Neon, Claude, 1905; Neon Signs, Miller &amp; Fink, 1935.&lt;/ref&gt;   These power supplies operate as constant-current sources (a high voltage supply with a very high internal impedance), since the tube has a negative characteristic [[electrical impedance]]. Standard tube tables established in the early days of neon are still used that specify the gas fill pressures, in either Ne or Hg/Ar, as a function of tube length in feet, tube diameter and transformer voltage.

The standard traditional neon transformer, a magnetic shunt transformer, is a special non-linear type designed to keep the voltage across the tube raised to whatever level is necessary to produce the fixed current needed. The voltage drop of a tube is proportional to length and so the maximum voltage and length of tubing fed from a given transformer is limited. Generally, the loaded voltage drops to about 800 VAC at full  current. The short-circuit current is about the same.&lt;ref&gt;Neon, Claude, 1905: Neon signs, Miller &amp;Fink, 1935&lt;/ref&gt;

Compact high frequency inverter-converter transformers developed in the early 1990s are used, especially when low [[Radio Frequency Interference]] (RFI) is needed, such as in locations near high-fidelity sound equipment.  At the typical frequency of these solid state transformers, the plasma electron-ion recombination time is too long to extinguish and reignite the plasma at each cycle, unlike the case at [[utility frequency|power line frequency]]. The plasma does not broadcast high frequency switching noise and remains ionized continually, becoming radio noise free.

The most common current rating is 30 mA for general use, with 60 mA used for high-brightness applications like channel letters or architectural lighting.  120 mA sources are occasionally seen in illuminating applications, but are uncommon since special electrodes are required to withstand the current, and an accidental shock from a 120 mA transformer is much more likely to be fatal than from the lower current supplies.

The efficiency of neon lighting ranges between that of ordinary incandescent lights and that of [[fluorescent lamp]]s, depending on color. On a per-watt basis, incandescents produce 10 to 20 [[lumen (unit)|lumen]]s, while fluorescents produce 50 to 100 lumens. Neon light efficiency ranges from 10 lumens per watt for red, up to 60 lumens for green and blue when these colors result from internal [[phosphor]] coatings.&lt;ref name="signind"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.signindustry.com/neon/articles/2003-07-11-RC-NeonandFlour.php3 | title=Neon and Fluorescents: A Circus of Similarities | accessdate=4 March 2011 | author=Caba, Randall L. | publisher=SignIndustry.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blocking out and coating===
{{noreferences|1=section|date=November 2018}}
[[File:Club Prima Donna 1955.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=3|Club Prima Donna animated neon sign in [[Reno, Nevada]], 1955.]]
A trick of the eye is used to produce visually distinct neon display segments by blocking out parts of the tube with an opaque coating.  One complete assembly may be composed of contiguous tube elements joined by glass welding to one another so that the same current passes through, for example, several letters joined end to end from cathode to cathode.  To the untrained eye, this looks like separate tubes, but the electrical splice is the plasma inside the crossover glass itself.  The entire tube lights up, but the segments that the viewer is not supposed to see are covered with highly opaque special black or gray glass paint. This heat-resistant coating is either painted on or dipped.  Without blockout paint, the unintended visual connections would make the display appear confusing.

In most mass-produced low-priced signs today, clear glass tubing is coated with translucent paint to produce colored light.  In this way, several different colors can be produced inexpensively from a single glowing tube.  Over time, elevated temperatures, thermal cycling, or exposure to weather may cause the colored coating to flake off the glass or change its hue. A more expensive alternative is to use high-quality colored glass tubing, which retains a more stable appearance as it ages.

==Applications==
Light-emitting tubes form colored lines with which a text can be written or a picture drawn, including various decorations, especially in [[advertising]] and [[commercial signage]]. By programming sequences of switching parts on and off, there are many possibilities for dynamic light patterns that form [[animation|animated images]].

In some applications, neon tubes are increasingly being replaced with [[light emitting diode|LEDs]], given the steady advance in LED luminosity and decreasing cost of high-intensity LEDs.&lt;ref name=SignWebLED&gt;{{cite web|title=Lighting &amp; LED|url=http://www.signweb.com/products/lighting-led|work=SignWeb|publisher=Media Group International|accessdate=2012-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, proponents of neon technology maintain that they still have significant advantages over LEDs.&lt;ref name=NeonVsLED&gt;{{cite web|title=Knowledge Center|url=http://www.theneongroup.org/knowledge.html|work=Brighter Thinking|publisher=The Neon Group|accessdate=2012-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neon illumination is valuable to invoke 1940s or 1950s [[nostalgia]] in marketing and in historic restoration of architectural landmarks from the neon era. Architecture in the [[streamline moderne]] era often deployed neon to accent [[vitreous marble|structural pigmented glass]] built into the façade of a 1930s or 1940s structure; many of these buildings now qualify for inclusion on [[list of heritage registers|historic register]]s such as the U.S. [[National Register of Historic Places]] if their historic integrity is faithfully maintained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/hps/tps/briefs/brief25.htm |title=The Preservation of Historic Signs|author=Michael J.

'''Novovoronezh Nuclear Power Plant II''' ('''NvNPPII'''; {{lang-ru|Нововоронежская АЭС II}} [{{Audio|Ru-Нововоронежская атомная электростанция 2.ogg|pronunciation}}]) is a [[Russia]]n [[nuclear power plant]] located in [[Voronezh Oblast]]. 
Unit 1 started operation in 2017 and was the first [[Generation III reactor#Generation_III.2B_reactors|Generation III+ nuclear reactor]] in the world.{{cn|date=August 2018}}
Unit 2 is under construction and two more units are planned.
It is being built on the same site as the present [[Novovoronezh Nuclear Power Plant]].

==History==
In 2006, the Russian government legislated a nuclear expansion plan for 2007–2015.  The plan aimed to put two new nuclear reactors into operation each year from 2012. This decision provided impetus for the construction of NNPPII, which had been originally been mooted in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://de.rian.ru/russia/20061230/58178702.html  | title= In Woronesch beginnt 2007 der Bau eines neuen Atom-Kraftwerkes  | date= 30 December 2006 |work= | publisher= [[RIA Novosti]] | language= German  | accessdate= 2009-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
On 20 June 2007 preparations began at the construction site.&lt;ref name="rian1"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://de.rian.ru/business/20070621/67621069.html | title= Russland will neuen Energieblock mit Druckwasserreaktor bauen - "Rossijskaja Gaseta"  | date= 2007-06-21 |work= | publisher= RIA Novosti | language= German  | accessdate= 2009-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Construction starting ceremony was held on 12 July 2009.&lt;ref name=wnn140709&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NN-Construction_starts_at_second_Novovoronezh_II_unit-1407094.html | title= Construction starts at second Novovoronezh-II unit | date= 2009-07-14 | work= [[World Nuclear News]] | accessdate= 2009-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017 the plant took delivery of a [[Safety instrumented system|safety instrumentation and control system]] from [[Areva|Areva NP]] for installation in its Unit 1.&lt;ref name="20170104_NPD"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.nuclearpowerdaily.com/reports/AREVA_NP_supplies_Safety_Instrumentation_and_Control_System_for_Generation_3_Reactor_999.html |title= AREVA NP supplies Safety Instrumentation and Control System for Generation 3 Reactor |website= nuclearpowerdaily.com |date= 2017-01-04 |accessdate= 2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Novovoronezh Nuclear Power Plant II-1.JPG|thumb|262px|right|Unit 1., Summer 2010]]
The power station will comprise two to four [[VVER#VVER-1200|VVER-1200/392M]] reactors of the [[AES-2006]] type. These reactors are the first of their kind. Unit&amp;nbsp;1 was planned to be added to the grid in 2012, with the second unit to be added a year later.&lt;ref name=wnn140709/&gt; Cost of the project is between 110 and 130&amp;nbsp;billion Rubles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | url= http://de.rian.ru/business/20070615/67304369.html  | title= Russland will neues Atomkraftwerk im Wert von 3,8 Milliarden Euro bauen | date= 15 June 2007 |work= | publisher= RIA Novosti | language= German  | accessdate= 2009-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The city of [[Novovoronezh]] is to provide housing for incoming NvNPP&amp;nbsp;II construction workers. In early 2008 the first two apartment blocks were complete and ready to use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rosatom.ru/en/press-releases/7120_21.11.2007 The headquarters for the construction of Novovoronezh NPP-2 met on 15 November]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://novnpp.rosenergoatom.ru/eng/press/news/article/?article-id=7709838F-6651-4671-9DC6-44D0D206211C On 14 February Atomenergoproekt started the next stage of Novovoronezh NPP-2 project]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction of the nuclear power plant is important because the existing Novovoronezh nuclear power plant is a focal point of the energy supply system. The power plant complex provides energy not only to [[Voronezh Oblast]] but to [[Belgorod Oblast|Belgorod]], [[Lipetsk Oblast|Lipetsk]] and [[Tambov Oblast|Tambov]] territories as well.&lt;ref name="rian1"/&gt;

[[File:Nuclear Energy Board (Ireland) logo.png|thumb|right|The corporate logo]]

The '''Nuclear Energy Board'''&lt;ref&gt;The Nuclear Energy Board was officially titled "''An Bord Fuinnimh Núicléigh''", in the [[Irish language]], however the English language title — though unofficial — was used in practice.&lt;/ref&gt; ('''NEB''') was an Irish agency charged with developing nuclear power in Ireland.  It was established in Ireland on November 30, 1973 by the Nuclear Energy (An Bord Fuinnimh Núicléigh) Act 1971.

The board was responsible in the 1970s for pursuing the policy of developing a [[nuclear power]] station, which was to be located at [[Carnsore Point]], [[County Wexford]]. This policy ultimately failed and the board gradually faded from public attention, eventually concentrating on nuclear-related environmental reports. It was not a large organisation, with the [[Electricity Supply Board]] doing most operational work.

==Nuclear power==

=== Planning ===

In 1968, Ireland's economic development required more energy production and the Electricity Supply Board began evaluating ways of diversifying its electricity generation. The [[Turlough Hill]] project had just commenced and this was one of the most prestigious engineering projects since the foundation of the state and the [[Shannon hydroelectric scheme]]. In the 1970s the need for new energy sources became more urgent, especially after the [[1973 energy crisis]]. In 1975 [[Bord Gáis]] was established in order to develop [[Kinsale]] gas field, slowing the nuclear energy project as it was hoped it may be an alternative. However, in 1974 [[planning permission]] was sought for four reactors with [[County Wexford]] [[County Council]], with one to be built immediately, most likely of [[pressurized water reactor]] design.

=== Uncertainty ===

The economic slowdown of 1974 and 1975 saw the project temporarily put on hold. When [[Desmond O'Malley]] became the new [[Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation|Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy]] in 1977 the project once again became a priority of government policy. This time the government wanted to build a 650 [[Megawatt|MW]] plant at [[Carnsore]] at a cost of £350 million ([[Irish Pound|Punt]]) at then-prices. In 1979 the project was again postponed, following a change in government when [[George Colley]] became [[Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht|the new minister in charge of the project]] and the incident at [[Three Mile Island]] in the United States. [[Friends of the Earth]] and other groups lobbied against the plan and in 1981 the Electricity Supply Board and the government announced it was no longer national policy.

=== Cancellation ===

Ultimately the board was remembered for the plans put on and off hold, and resulting immense controversy. Also there was criticism that the government overestimated the need of energy in Ireland in the future; at one point it was estimated that industry would consume 57% of energy by 1990 - internationally this is rather large, as 40% is a typical value. Nevertheless, Ireland in the 1970s was regarded as being in a dangerous position on energy, as 75% of needs were met by [[Petroleum|oil]], and [[European Economic Community]] policy was to reduce this below 50% by 1985, after two [[energy crisis|energy crises]].

==Aftermath==
After 1981 the Nuclear Energy Board was not immediately abolished, instead rather than becoming nuclear [[advocate]], with the board became redefined in a new role as an [[environmentalist]]. The board sponsored a number of reports, in particular on the [[Sellafield]] plant which has long been a source of dispute between [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and the [[United Kingdom]].

On 1 April 1992 the successor to the board was established, the [[Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland]]. The production of electricity for supply to the national grid, by nuclear fission, is currently prohibited under the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 (Section 18).

'''Pleuston''' are the organisms that live in the thin surface layer existing at the air-water interface of a body of water as their [[habitat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pleuston|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pleuston|work=Merriam-Webster Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Examples include some [[cyanobacteria]], some [[gastropod]]s, the [[fern]]s ''[[Azolla]]'' and ''[[Salvinia]]'' and the seed plants ''[[Lemna]]'', ''[[Wolffia]]'', ''[[Pistia]]'', ''[[Eichhornia crassipes]]'' and ''[[Hydrocharis]]''. Some fungi and fungi-like protists may be also found.

==Neuston==
The term ''Neuston'' is used either:
*As a synonym for Pleuston: hence, the collective term for the [[organism]]s that float on the top of water (epineuston) or live right under the surface (hyponeuston). 
*That subset of floating organisms that are microscopic&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=P. S. Liss, W. George N. Slinn|title=Air-sea exchange of gases and particles|isbn=978-90-277-1610-1|pages=148|date=1983-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; or those that rely on [[surface tension]] to float.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=James H. Thorp, Alan P. Covich|title=Ecology and classification of North American freshwater invertebrates|isbn=978-0-12-690647-9|pages=34|date=2001-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in comparison with the term '''pleuston''', which is then its superset, including those organisms that float by buoyancy or are macroscopic.
[[image:Pink-wing flying fish.jpg|right|250px|thumb|A [[flying fish]]]]
Neustons, broadly defined, are made up of some species of [[fish]] (see [[flying fish]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yHTGFh1jq6AC&amp;pg=PA46|title=The Sea Surface and Global Change by P. S. Liss, Robert A. Duce|author=|date=|website=google.com|accessdate=9 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;), [[beetle]]s (see [[whirligig beetle]]), [[protozoans]], [[bacteria]] and [[spiders]] (see [[fishing spider]] and [[diving bell spider]]).  [[Springtail]]s in the genera ''[[Podura]]'' and ''[[Sminthurides]]'' are almost exclusively neustonic, while ''[[Hypogastrura]]'' species often aggregate on pond surfaces.  [[Water strider]]s such as ''[[Gerris]]'' are common examples of insects that supports their weight on water's [[surface tension]]. By extension, the term may also refer to non-organismal floating aggregations (see, ''e.g.'', [[Great Pacific Garbage Patch]]).

==Distinction versus other aquatic life==
[[Plankton]] (organisms that float or drift within the water) are distinguished from [[nekton]] (organisms that swim, powerfully, in the water), and [[benthos]] (organisms on the bottom of a body of water).

'''Pyrophanite''' is a [[manganese]] [[titanium]] [[oxide mineral]] with formula: MnTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. It is a member of the [[ilmenite]] group. It is a deep red to greenish black mineral which crystallizes in the [[trigonal]] system.

==Discovery and occurrence==
It was first described in 1890 from an occurrence in the Harstigen Mine, [[Filipstad]], [[Värmland]], [[Sweden]].&lt;ref name=Mindat/&gt; Its name was derived from the Greek ''πΰρ,'' fire, and ''φαίνεσθαι,'' to appear, because of the deep red color of the mineral.&lt;ref name=Mindat/&gt;

Its main occurrence is in manganese deposits that have undegone [[metamorphism]]. It also occurs in [[granite]], [[amphibolite]] and [[serpentinite]] as an uncommon accessory  
mineral. Associated minerals include ilmenite, [[geikielite]], [[hematite]], [[spinel]], [[gahnite]], [[chromite]], [[magnetite]], [[ganophyllite]], [[manganophyllite]], [[hendricksite]], [[garnet]] and [[calcite]].&lt;ref name=HBM/&gt;

In [[forestry]], a '''skid cone''' is a hollow steel or plastic cone placed over the sawn end of a log. When [[Skidder|skidding]] (dragging) logs end-wise, it presents a pointed end that deflects itself past obstacles.

Skid cones are most popularly used when skidding single logs behind [[All-terrain vehicle|ATV]]s or light tractors, particularly when a single operator is too occupied with driving to keep a continuous watch behind. Heavy tractors and large logs smash through obstacles. Horse loggers work from behind the horse and have a better view of the moving log. Skid cones are also useful when winching by rope, where it's more difficult to steer a log.

Skid cones prevent logs from being stopped by roots, stumps or residual trees while being harvested. It also protects standing valuable trees along the path from being damaged. Operator safety is enhanced, as the cone prevents sudden stops caused by logs getting caught in an obstacle.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11697">A '''solar thermal rocket''' is a theoretical [[spacecraft propulsion]] system that would make use of solar power to directly heat [[reaction mass]], and therefore would not require an electrical generator, like most other forms of solar-powered propulsion do.  The rocket would only have to carry the means of capturing solar energy, such as [[Concentrating solar power|concentrator]]s and [[mirror]]s. The heated propellant would be fed through a conventional [[rocket nozzle]] to produce thrust. Its engine thrust would be directly related to the surface area of the solar collector and to the local intensity of the solar radiation.

In the shorter term, solar thermal propulsion has been proposed both for longer-life, lower-cost and more-flexible cryogenic [[upper stage]] launch vehicles and for on-orbit [[propellant depot]]s.  Solar thermal propulsion is also a good candidate for use in reusable inter-orbital tugs, as it is a high-efficiency low-thrust system that can be refuelled with relative ease.

==Solar-thermal design concepts==

There are two solar thermal propulsion concepts, differing primarily in the method by which they use solar power to heat up the propellant:{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}
*''Indirect solar heating'' involves pumping the propellant through passages in a [[heat exchanger]] that is heated by solar radiation. The windowless heat exchanger cavity concept is a design taking this radiation absorption approach.
*''Direct solar heating'' involves exposing the propellant directly to solar radiation. The rotating bed concept is one of the preferred concepts for direct solar radiation absorption; it offers higher [[specific impulse]] than other direct heating designs by using a retained seed ([[tantalum carbide]] or [[hafnium carbide]]) approach. The propellant flows through the porous walls of a rotating cylinder, picking up heat from the seeds, which are retained on the walls by the rotation. The [[carbide]]s are stable at high temperatures and have excellent heat transfer properties.

Due to limitations in the temperature that heat exchanger materials can withstand (approximately 2800 [[Kelvin|K]]), the indirect absorption designs cannot achieve specific impulses beyond 900 seconds (9&amp;nbsp;kN·s/kg = 9 km/s) (or up to 1000 seconds, see below). The direct absorption designs allow higher propellant temperatures and therefore higher specific impulses, approaching 1200 seconds. Even the lower specific impulse represents a significant increase over that of conventional [[chemical rocket]]s, however, an increase that can provide substantial payload gains (45 percent for a [[Low Earth orbit|LEO]]-to-[[Geosynchronous orbit|GEO]] mission) at the expense of increased trip time (14 days compared to 10 hours).{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Small-scale hardware has been designed and fabricated for the [[Air Force Rocket Propulsion Laboratory]] (AFRPL) for ground test evaluation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psicorp.com/pdf/library/sr-1228.pdf Solar Thermal Propulsion for Small Spacecraft - Engineering System Development and Evaluation PSI-SR-1228 publisher AIAA July 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;  Systems with 10 to 100 N of thrust have been investigated by SART.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.la.dlr.de/ra/sart/projects/sto/sto.php.en Webpage DLR Solar Thermal Propulsion of the Institut für Raumfahrtantriebe Abteilung Systemanalyse Raumtransport (SART) date = November 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070706053556/http://www.la.dlr.de/ra/sart/projects/sto/sto.php.en |date=2007-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reusable Orbital Transfer Vehicles (OTV), sometimes called (inter-orbital) space tugs, propelled by solar thermal rockets have been proposed. The concentrators on solar thermal tugs are less susceptible to radiation in the Van Allen belts than the solar arrays of solar electric OTV.&lt;ref name="OTV_options"&gt;{{cite web |last1=John H. Schilling|first1=Frank S. Gulczinski III |title=Comparison of Orbit Transfer Vehicle Concepts Utilizing Mid-Term Power and Propulsion Options |url=http://erps.spacegrant.org/uploads/images/images/iepc_articledownload_1988-2007/2003index/0022-0303iepc-full.pdf |accessdate=May 23, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Propellants==

Most proposed designs for solar thermal rockets use [[hydrogen]] as their propellant due to its low [[molecular weight]] which gives excellent [[specific impulse]] of up to 1000 seconds (10&amp;nbsp;kN·s/kg) using heat exchangers made of rhenium.&lt;ref name=ultramet_rhenium&gt;{{cite web|last=Ultramet|title=Advanced Propulsion Concepts - Solar Thermal Propulsion|url=http://www.ultramet.com/propulsionsystem_components_advanced.html|publisher=Ultramet|accessdate=June 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Conventional thought has been that hydrogen—although it gives excellent specific impulse—is not space storable.  Recent design work has developed an approach to substantially reduce hydrogen boiloff, and to economically utilize the small remaining boiloff product for requisite in-space tasks, essentially achieving zero boil off (ZBO) from a practical point of view.&lt;ref name=aiaa20100902_p5&gt;Zegler and Kutter, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp |p. 3,4,7}}

Other substances could also be used. Water gives quite poor performance of 190 seconds (1.9&amp;nbsp;kN·s/kg), but requires only simple equipment to purify and handle, and is space storable and this has very seriously been proposed for interplanetary use,{{By whom|date=January 2011}} [[In-situ resource utilization|using in-situ resources]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

[[Ammonia]] has been proposed as a propellant.&lt;ref name=physical_sciences_inc&gt;{{cite web|last=PSI|title=Solar Thermal Propulsion for Small Spacecraft_Engineering System Development and Evaluation|url=http://www.psicorp.com/pdf/library/sr-1228.pdf|publisher=PSI|accessdate=August 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It offers higher specific impulse than water, but is easily storable, with a freezing point of −77 degrees Celsius and a boiling point of −33.34 °C. The exhaust dissociates into hydrogen and nitrogen, leading to a lower average molecular weight, and thus a higher Isp (65% of hydrogen).{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

A solar-thermal propulsion architecture outperforms architectures involving electrolysis and liquification of hydrogen from water by more than an order of magnitude, since electrolysis requires heavy power generators, whereas distillation only requires a simple and compact heat source (either nuclear or solar); so the propellant production rate is correspondingly far higher for any given initial mass of equipment.

Solar thermal rockets have been proposed &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newmars.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=2483 NewMars, Solar Thermal Tech for Ground Launch?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220013037/http://www.newmars.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=2483 |date=2012-02-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{full|date=November 2012}} as a system for launching a small personal spacecraft into orbit. The design is based on a high altitude airship which uses its envelope to focus sunlight onto a tube. The propellant, which would likely be ammonia, is then fed through to produce thrust. Possible design flaws include whether the engine could produce enough thrust to overcome drag, and whether the skin of the airship wouldn't fail at hypersonic velocities. This has many similarities to the orbital airship proposed by [[JP Aerospace]].

==Proposed solar-thermal space systems==
{{as of|2010}}, two proposals for utilizing solar-thermal propulsion on in-space post-launch spacecraft systems have been made.

A concept to provide [[low Earth orbit]] (LEO) [[propellant depot]]s that could be used as way-stations for other spacecraft to stop and refuel on the way to beyond-LEO missions has proposed that waste gaseous [[hydrogen]]—an inevitable byproduct of long-term [[liquid hydrogen]] storage in the [[Radiative heat transfer|radiative heat]] environment of [[outer space|space]]—would be usable as a [[Monopropellant rocket|monopropellant]] in a solar-thermal propulsion system.  The waste hydrogen would be productively utilized for both [[orbital stationkeeping]] and [[attitude control]], as well as providing limited propellant and thrust to use for [[Orbital_maneuver#Non-impulsive_maneuvers|orbital maneuvers]] to better [[Space rendezvous|rendezvous]] with other spacecraft that would be inbound to receive fuel from the depot.&lt;ref name=aiaa20100902&gt;
{{cite web|last=Zegler|first=Frank |title=Evolving to a Depot-Based Space Transportation Architecture |url=http://bigidea.nianet.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/DepotBasedTransportationArchitecture20101.pdf|work=AIAA SPACE 2010 Conference &amp; Exposition |publisher=AIAA |accessdate=March 31, 2017 |author2=Bernard Kutter  |date=2010-09-02  |page=3 |quote=the waste hydrogen that has boiled off happens to be the best known propellant (as a monopropellant in a basic solar-thermal propulsion system) for this task. A practical depot must evolve hydrogen at a minimum rate that matches the station keeping demands.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Solar-thermal monoprop hydrogen thrusters are also integral to the design of the next-generation cryogenic [[upper stage]] [[rocket]] proposed by [[United States|U.S.]] company [[United Launch Alliance]] (ULA).  The [[Advanced Common Evolved Stage]] (ACES) is intended as a lower-cost, more-capable and more-flexible upper stage that would supplement, and perhaps replace, the existing ULA [[Centaur (rocket stage)|Centaur]] and ULA [[Delta_IV#Vehicle_description|Delta Cryogenic Second Stage]] (DCSS) upper stage vehicles.  The ACES [[Integrated Vehicle Fluids]] option eliminates all [[hydrazine]] monopropellant and all [[helium]] pressurant from the space vehicle—normally used for attitude control and station keeping—and depends instead on solar-thermal monoprop thrusters using waste hydrogen.&lt;ref name=aiaa20100902_p5/&gt;{{rp |p. 5}}

The viability of various trips using Solar Thermal propulsion was investigated by Gordon Woodcock and Dave Byers in 2003.&lt;ref name=AIAA20035029&gt;{{cite journal|last=Byers|first=Woodcock |title=Results of Evaluation of Solar Thermal Propulsion, AIAA 2003-5029 |publisher=AIAA |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Facility4508_Pylon206.JPG|thumb|Transposition tower. On the right side, the phases are rotated upward, on the left side downward.]]
In [[electrical power transmission]], a '''transposition tower''' is a [[transmission tower]] that changes the relative physical positions of the [[Conductor (power engineering)|conductors]] of a [[transmission line]]. A transposition tower allows these sections to be connected together, while maintaining adequate clearance for the conductors. This is important since it distributes [[electrical impedance]]s between phases of a circuit over time, reducing the problem of one conductor carrying more current than others.

Double-circuit lines are usually set up with conductors of the same phase placed opposite each other.
This reduces the reactance due to mutual inductance; the reactance of both circuits together is less than half that of one circuit. For example, a section of a line may be (top-to-bottom) phases A-B-C on the left, also phases C'-B'-A' on the right. The next section may be B-C-A on the left, also A'-C'-B' on the right. Therefore, the rotation on each side of the tower will be opposite.
[[Image:Verdrillmast_Oberwoehr.jpg|thumb|left|Here, on the right the phases are rotated; on the left, two phases are swapped, thus the rotation sense changed.]]

{{Tropicalcyclone}}
'''Tropical cyclone observation''' has been carried out over the past couple of centuries in various ways.  The passage of typhoons, hurricanes, as well as other tropical cyclones have been detected by word of mouth from sailors recently coming to port or by radio transmissions from ships at sea, from sediment deposits in near shore estuaries, to the wiping out of cities near the coastline.  Since [[World War II]], advances in technology have included using planes to survey the ocean basins, satellites to monitor the world's oceans from [[outer space]] using a variety of methods, radars to monitor their progress near the coastline, and recently the introduction of [[unmanned aerial vehicles]] to penetrate storms.  Recent studies have concentrated on studying hurricane impacts lying within rocks or near shore lake sediments, which are branches of a new field known as [[paleotempestology]].  This article details the various methods employed in the creation of the hurricane database, as well as reconstructions necessary for reanalysis of past storms used in projects such as the [[Atlantic hurricane reanalysis]].

==Geological markers of past activity==

===Stalagmites in caves===
Recent studies of the [[Oxygen-18|&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O]] and [[Carbon-13|&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C]] isotopes found in [[stalagmite]]s in [[Belize]] show that tropical cyclone events can leave markers that can be separated out on a week-by-week basis.  The error rate of this type of microanalysis was 1 error in 1,200 sampling points.&lt;ref name="Frappier2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Frappier |first=Amy Benoit |authorlink= |author2=Sahagian, Dork |author3=Carpenter, Scott J. |author4=González, Luis A. |author5= Frappier Brian R.  |year=2007 |title=Stalagmite stable isotope record of recent tropical cyclone events |journal=Geology |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=111–114 |doi=10.1130/G23145A.1 |url= |accessdate= |quote= |bibcode = 2007Geo....35..111B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Markers in coral===
Rocks contain certain isotopes of elements, known as natural tracers, which describe the conditions under which they formed.  By studying the calcium carbonate in coral rock, past sea surface temperature and hurricane information can be revealed.  Lighter oxygen isotopes (&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O) are left behind in coral during periods of very heavy rainfall.&lt;ref&gt;Nobu Shimizu. [http://www.whoi.edu/oceanus/viewArticle.do?id=2437 If Rocks Could Talk...] Retrieved on 2006-12-09.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since hurricanes are the main source of extreme rainfall in the tropical oceans, past hurricane events can be dated to the days of their impact on the coral by looking at the increased &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O concentration within the coral.&lt;ref&gt;Anne L.

===Sediment deposition in coastal lakes===
Kam Biu-Liu, a professor at [[Louisiana State University]], has been studying sediment lying at the bottom of coastal lakes and marshes in order to study the frequency and intensity of hurricanes over the past 5,000&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Liu |first=Kam-biu |authorlink= |author2=Fearn, Miriam L.  |year=2000 |title=Reconstruction of Prehistoric Landfall Frequencies of Catastrophic Hurricanes in Northwestern Florida from Lake Sediment Records |journal=Quaternary Research |volume=54 |issue=2 |pages=238–245 |doi=10.1006/qres.2000.2166 |url= |accessdate= |quote= |bibcode=2000QuRes..54..238L}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since storm surges sweep coastal sands with them as they progress inland, a layer of sand is left behind in coastal lakes and marshes.

==Newspapers==
Before the invention of the [[telegraph]] in the early to mid-19th century, news was as fast as the quickest horse, stage, or ship.  Normally, there was no advance warning of a tropical cyclone impact.  However, the situation changed in the 19th century as seafaring people and land-based researchers, such as Father Viñes in [[Cuba]], came up with systematic methods of reading the sky's appearance or the sea state, which could foretell a tropical cyclone's approach up to a couple days in advance.

In [[China]], the abundance of historical documentary records in the form of ''{{lang|zh-Latn|Fang Zhi}}'' (semiofficial local gazettes) offers an extraordinary opportunity for providing a high-resolution historical dataset for the frequency of typhoon strikes. Kam-biu Liu ''et al.'' (2001) reconstructed a 1,000-year time series of typhoon landfalls in the Guangdong Province of southern China since AD 975 and found that on a decadal timescale, the twenty-year interval from AD 1660 to 1680 is the most active period on record, with twenty-eight to thirty-seven typhoon landfalls per decade. The variability in typhoon landfalls in Guangdong mimics that observed in other paleoclimatic proxies (e.g., tree rings, ice cores) from China and the northern hemisphere. Remarkably, the two periods of most frequent typhoon strikes in Guangdong (AD 1660-1680, 1850–1880) coincide with two of the coldest and driest periods in northern and central China during the [[Little Ice Age]].&lt;ref name="Liu2001"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kam-biu Liu |author2=Caiming Shen |author3=Kin-sheun Louie |year=2001 |title=A 1,000-Year History of Typhoon Landfalls in Guangdong, Southern China, Reconstructed from Chinese Historical Documentary Records |journal=Annals of the Association of American Geographers |volume=91 |issue=3 |pages=453–464 |doi=10.1111/0004-5608.00253 |url= |accessdate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Surface observations==

Note that no hurricane was detected on Mid-Atlantic in 1933.&lt;/small&gt;}}

===Ship reports===
For centuries, people have sailed the world's oceans and seas, and for just as long, they have encountered storms.  The worst of the cyclones over the open seas likely took those that observed them into the depths of the oceans.  However, some did survive to report harrowing tales.  Before the invention of the wireless [[telegraph]] in 1905, reports about storms at sea either coincided with their arrival at the coast as ships scrambled into port, or came weeks and months afterwards from remote ports of call.  Ship and buoy reports, available since the 1970s, are used in real-time not only for their temperature, pressure, and wind measurements, but also for their sea surface temperature and wave height measurements.

Wind reports from ships at sea have become increasingly based on anemometers, and less so on the [[Beaufort Scale]].  This is important to note as the Beaufort Scale underestimates winds at higher wind speeds, indicating ship wind observations taken for older storms are likely to underrepresent their true value.&lt;ref name="TM22"&gt;Brian R. Jarvinen, Charles J. Neumann, and Mary A. S. Davis. [http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/general/lib/lib1/nhclib/nwstechmemos/techmemo22.pdf A Tropical Cyclone Data Tape For the North Atlantic Basin, 1886-1983:  Contents, Limitations, and Uses.] Retrieved on 2006-12-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[Christopher Landsea]] ''et al.'' point out, many tropical cyclones that formed on the open sea and did not affect any coast usually went undetected prior to satellite observation since the 1970s. They estimated an undercount bias of zero to six tropical cyclones per year between 1851 and 1885 and zero to four per year between 1886 and 1910. These undercounts roughly take into account the typical size of tropical cyclones, the density of shipping tracks over the Atlantic basin, and the amount of populated coastline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Hurricanes and Typhoons: Past, Present and Future |chapter=The Atlantic hurricane database re-analysis project: Documentation for the 1851–1910 alterations and additions to the HURDAT database |last=Landsea |first=C.

===Land-based observations===
In the early 20th century, forecasting the track of cyclones was still confined to areas of the greatest surface pressure falls, based upon [[surface weather observation]]s, and climatology.  These methods proved to be the cutting edge of tropical cyclone forecasting through the mid 20th century.  Land-based surface observations remain invaluable as a source of real-time information at locations near the coastline and inland.  Combined with ship observations and newspapers, they formed the total information network for hurricane detection until radiosondes were introduced in 1941 and reconnaissance aircraft began in 1944.&lt;ref name="TM22"/&gt;  Land-based observations of pressure and wind can show how quickly a tropical cyclone is decaying as it moves inland.  Their rainfall reports show where significant rainfall is occurring, and can be an alert for possible flooding.  With the establishment of the ASOS network in the [[United States]] during the 1990s, more locations are reporting around the clock than ever before.&lt;ref name="CPHC"&gt;Central Pacific Hurricane Center.

====Mobile platforms====
Since the 1990s, academic researchers have begun to deploy mobile weather stations fortified to withstand hurricane-force winds. The two largest programs are the Florida Coastal Monitoring Program&lt;ref name="FCMP"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://users.ce.ufl.edu/~fcmp/overview/overview.htm | author = Florida Coastal Monitoring Program | title = Project Overview | accessdate = 2006-03-30 | publisher = [[University of Florida]]|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060117051820/http://users.ce.ufl.edu/~fcmp/overview/overview.htm |archivedate = January 17, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Wind Engineering Mobile Instrumented Tower Experiment.&lt;ref name="WEMITE"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.atmo.ttu.edu/WEMITE/introduction.htm | author= Hurricane Research Team | title = Texas Tech Hurricane Research Team Project History and Information | publisher = [[Texas Tech University]] | accessdate = 2006-03-30 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060901111403/http://www.atmo.ttu.edu/WEMITE/introduction.htm |archivedate = September 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; During landfall, the NOAA Hurricane Research Division compares and verifies data from reconnaissance aircraft, including wind speed data taken at flight level and from GPS dropwindsondes and stepped-frequency microwave radiometers, to wind speed data transmitted in real time from weather stations erected near or at the coast.  The National Hurricane Center uses the data to evaluate conditions at landfall and to verify forecasts.

===Reconnaissance aircraft===
{{See also|Tropical cyclone forecasting}}
The idea of aircraft reconnaissance of tropical cyclones first was put forth by Captain W. L. Farnsworth of the Galveston Commercial Association in the early 1930s.  Supported by the [[United States Weather Bureau]], it passed both the [[United States Senate]] and [[United States House of Representatives]] in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;[[Associated Press]]. [http://www.thehurricanearchive.com/Viewer.aspx?img=45222992_clean&amp;firstvisit=true&amp;src=search&amp;currentResult=2&amp;currentPage=0 STORM PATROL BILL PASSED TO PRESIDENT.]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Retrieved on 2008-06-06.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 1944, aircraft have been flying out to sea to find tropical cyclones.  Before regular satellite coverage, this was a hit-or-miss affair.  Thereafter, aircraft flights into tropical systems became more targeted and precise.  Nowadays, a C-130 is used as a hurricane hunter by the Air Force, while the P-3 Orion is used by the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] for research projects used to better understand [[tropical cyclone]]s and improve hurricane forecasts.&lt;ref name="CPHC"/&gt;
The implementation of synoptic observation missions by a Gulfstream jet, where dropwindsondes are used to investigate a tropical cyclone's environment, has led to a 15-20 percent reduction in track forecast errors where such missions were present.&lt;ref name="GEE"&gt;B.

During [[World War II]], [[radar]] technology was developed to detect aircraft.  It soon became apparent that large areas became obscured when significant weather was in the area.  In 1957, the [[National Weather Service]] established the [[United States]]' first radar network to cover the coastline and act as first warning of an impending tropical cyclone.  Upgraded in the 1990s to use doppler technology, radar can provide rainfall estimates, wind estimates, possible locations of tornadoes within a system's spiral bands, as well as the center location of a tropical cyclone.&lt;ref name="CPHC"/&gt; The United States operates with a network of 158 Doppler Radars across the country.&lt;ref name=NOAA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.noaa.gov/organizations.html |title=Organization &amp;#124; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration |website=Noaa.gov |date=2016-03-30 |accessdate=2016-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Satellite===
Beginning with the launching of TIROS-I in April 1960, satellites have been used to look for tropical cyclones.  The Dvorak technique was developed from early satellite images of tropical cyclones to determine real-time a tropical cyclone's strength from characteristics seen on satellite imagery.  In most tropical cyclone basins, use of the satellite-based [[Dvorak technique]] is the primary method used to determine a tropical cyclone's maximum sustained winds.  The extent of banding and difference in temperature between the eye and eyewall is used within the technique to assign a maximum sustained wind and pressure.&lt;ref&gt;Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory.

The '''Trung Sơn Dam''' (''Dự Án Nhà máy Thủy điện Trung Sơn'') is a [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] power station under construction on the [[Ma River]] in northwestern [[Vietnam]].  Located in the Trung Sơn commune, [[Quan Hóa District]], [[Thanh Hóa Province]], it is approximately {{convert|95|km}} southwest of [[Hòa Bình]] city, and {{convert|195|km}} northwest of Thanh Hóa city.  The dam will create a reservoir which covers a large area of the [[Mường Lát District|Mường Lát]] and Quan Hóa Districts in the Thanh Hoa province as well as part of the [[Mộc Châu District]] in [[Sơn La Province]].  It is approximately {{convert|9.5|km}} from the Vietnam–[[Laos]] border.

==The Project==
The Trung Sơn hydropower project is owned by Trung Sơn Hydropower Company Limited (TSHPCo), the entity established by [[Vietnam Electricity]] (EVN) in Decision No. 106/QD-ENV dated March 17, 2011.  TSHPCo is responsible for the management, construction and operation of the Trung Sơn hydropower project.

The project will provide both power generation and flood control.  The powerhouse is designed to contain four generating units with a total capacity of 260&amp;nbsp;MW and an annual output of 1,018.61&amp;nbsp;GWh,{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}, a significant addition to the national grid.  The flood control storage of {{convert|112|e6m3}} will help prevent floods downstream.

The project will cost a total of VND 7,775,146 million (equivalent to US $410.68 million).&lt;ref&gt;At the exchange rate of VND 18,932/ USD as published by the State Bank of Vietnam on December 31, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  This includes US $330 million from a World Bank loan, which was signed by the Socialist Republic of Vietnam and the World Bank on June 28, 2011.  Additionally, the project was given slightly over US $80 million from the counterpart fund of (EVN).

The project has created social, environmental and community relation programs to mitigate anticipated and unanticipated issues with populations either directly or indirectly impacted, the Resettlement, Livelihoods and Ethnic Minorities Development Program (RLDP).  These populations consist of approximately 10,600 people (2,327 households), of which 7,012 (1,516 households) will be directly impacted in the main project area, resulting in a total of 533 households having to be resettled.  The RLDP includes a Resettlement Plan (RP), a Community Livelihoods Improvement Plan (CLIP) and an Ethnic Minorities Development Plan (EMDP).

In addition, management has prepared a Supplementary Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (SESIA) with Environmental Management Plan (EMP) for the project.  This plan includes principles, approaches, procedures and methods to be used to control and minimize environmental impacts of all project-related construction and operation activities.  Compared with fossil-fuel based energy plants of the same size, the dam produces far less greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs). TSHPCo maintains a website at [http://www.trungsonhp.vn www.trungsonhp.vn] where public information is routinely updated.

The '''[[uranium]] market''', like all [[commodity market]]s, has a history of volatility, moving not only with the standard forces of [[supply and demand]], but also to whims of [[geopolitics]]. It has also evolved particularities of its own in response to the unique nature and use of this material.

Historically, uranium has been mined in countries willing to export, including Australia and Canada.&lt;ref name=platts&gt;{{cite web | publisher= Platts |url= http://www.platts.com/Nuclear/Resources/News%20Features/nukeinsight/ | title = Nuclear renaissance faces realities | accessdate=2007-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=esat&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Department of Electrical Engineering of the Faculty of Engineering |author1=L.

Uranium from mining is used almost entirely as fuel for [[nuclear power plant]]s. Following the 2011 [[Fukushima nuclear disaster]], the global uranium market remains depressed, with the uranium price falling more than 50%, declining share values, and reduced profitability of uranium producers since March 2011. As a result, uranium companies worldwide are reducing capacity, closing operations and deferring new production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nickel|first=Rod|title=Uranium producer Cameco scraps production target|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/08/cameco-results-idUSL2N0LD02K20140208|accessdate=17 April 2014|newspaper=Reuters|date=7 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Komnenic|first=Ana|title=Paladin Energy suspends production at Malawi uranium mine|url=http://www.mining.com/paladin-suspends-malawi-mine-66181/|accessdate=17 April 2014|newspaper=Mining.com|date=7 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before uranium is ready for use as [[nuclear fuel]] in reactors, it must undergo a number of intermediary processing steps which are identified as the front end of the [[nuclear fuel cycle]]: [[uranium mining|mining]] it (either underground or in [[open pit mine]]s), milling it into [[yellowcake]], [[enriched uranium|enriching it]] and finally fuel fabrication to produce fuel assemblies or bundles. This technologically complicated and challenging process is simple in comparison to the complexity of the market that has evolved to provide these three services.

==History==
{{See also|List of uranium mines}}
The world's top uranium producers in 2012 with 64% of production were [[Kazakhstan]] (36.5% of world production), Canada (15.4%) and Australia (12.0%).  Other major producers included [[Niger]], [[Namibia]] and Russia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Uranium Mining Production|url=http://world-nuclear.org/info/Nuclear-Fuel-Cycle/Mining-of-Uranium/World-Uranium-Mining-Production/#.Ua3e2pVXI64|publisher=World Nuclear Association|accessdate=17 April 2014|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Purification facilities are almost always located at the mining sites. The facilities for enrichment, on the other hand, are found in those countries that produce significant amounts of electricity from nuclear power. Large commercial enrichment plants are in operation in France, Germany, [[Netherlands]], [[United Kingdom|UK]], United States, and Russia, with smaller plants elsewhere. These nations form the core of the uranium market and influence considerable control over all buyers. The uranium market is a classic [[Market (economics)|seller's market]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} The uranium [[cartel]], as it became known, was the alliance of the major uranium producing nations. Representatives of these five countries met in [[Paris]], France in February, 1972 to discuss the "orderly marketing" of uranium. Although sounding innocuous, they had, amongst themselves, a monopoly in the uranium market and were deciding to exercise it.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

Global demand for uranium rose steadily from the end of [[World War II]], largely driven by [[nuclear weapon]]s procurement programs.  This trend lasted until the early 1980s, when changing geopolitical circumstances as well as environmental, safety, economic concerns over nuclear power plants reduced demand somewhat. The production of a series of large [[hydro-electric]] power stations has also helped to depress the global market since the early 1970s. This phenomenon can be traced back to the construction of the vast [[Aswan Dam]] in [[Egypt]], and to a certain extent with the ambitious [[Three Gorges Dam]] in China. During this time, large uranium inventories accumulated. In fact, until 1985 the Western uranium industry was producing material much faster than nuclear power plants and military programs were consuming it. Uranium prices slid throughout the decade with few respites, leaving the price below $10 per pound for yellowcake by year-end 1989.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}
 
As uranium prices fell, producers began curtailing operations or exiting the business entirely, leaving only a few actively involved in uranium mining and causing uranium inventories to shrink significantly. Since 1990 uranium requirements have outstripped uranium production. World uranium requirements have increased steadily to  171 million pounds of yellowcake in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Nuclear Power Reactors &amp; Uranium Requirements|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/Facts-and-Figures/World-Nuclear-Power-Reactors-and-Uranium-Requirements/|publisher=World Nuclear Association|accessdate=17 April 2014|date=1 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However several factors are pushing both industrialized and developing nations towards [[alternative energy]] sources. The increasing rate of consumption of [[fossil fuel]] is a concern for nations lacking in reserves, especially non-[[OPEC]] nations. The other issue is the level of [[pollution]] produced by coal-burning plants, and despite their vastness, an absence of economical methods for tapping into solar, wind-driven, or tidal reserves. Uranium suppliers hope that this will mean an increase in market share and an increase in volume over the long term.

Uranium prices reached an all-time low in 2001, costing US$7/lb. This was followed by a period of gradual rise, followed by a [[Uranium bubble of 2007|bubble culminating in mid-2007]], which caused the price to peak at around US$137/lb.&lt;ref name="bottom"&gt;

In 2012 [[Kazatomprom]] and [[Areva]] were the top two producing companies (with 15% of the production each), followed by [[Cameco]] (14%), [[ARMZ Uranium Holding]] (13%) and [[Rio Tinto Group|Rio Tinto]] (9%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bruneton|first=Patrice|title=Uranium Resources Global Outlook|url=http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/energy/se/pp/unfc_egrc/unfc_ws_IAEA_CYTED_UNECE_Santiago_July2013/10_July/1_Bruneton_Ursources.pdf|publisher=United Nations Economic Commission for Europe|accessdate=17 April 2014|format=pdf|date=9 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the shutdown of many nuclear power plants after the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]] in 2011, demand had fallen to about {{convert|60|kilotonne|e6lb|lk=on}} per year in 2015 with future forecasts uncertain.&lt;ref name=nei-20160901&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.neimagazine.com/opinion/opinionuranium-the-market-lower-prices-and-production-costs-4995055/ |title=Uranium - the market, lower prices and production costs |author=Steve Kidd |publisher=Nuclear Engineering International |date=1 September 2016 |accessdate=19 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the improvements in [[gas centrifuge]] technology in the 2000s, replacing former [[Gaseous diffusion|gaseous diffusion plants]], cheaper [[separative work units]] have enabled the economic production of more [[enriched uranium]] from a given amount of natural uranium, by re-enriching tails ultimately leaving a [[depleted uranium]] tail of lower enrichment. This has somewhat lowered the demand for natural uranium.&lt;ref name=nei-20160901/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wise-uranium.org/edumu.html |title=Uranium Enrichment Tails Upgrading (Re-enrichment) |publisher=WISE Uranium Project |date=4 June 2007 |accessdate=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Market operations==
Unlike other metals such as copper or nickel, uranium is not traded on an organized [[commodities exchange|commodity exchange]] such as the [[London Metal Exchange]]. Instead it is traded in most cases through contracts negotiated directly between a buyer and a seller.  Recently, however, the [[New York Mercantile Exchange]] [http://nymex.com/press_releas.aspx?id=pr20070416a announced] a 10-year agreement to provide for the trade of on and off exchange uranium futures contracts.

The structure of uranium supply [[contract]]s varies widely. Pricing can be as simple as a single fixed price, or based on various reference prices with economic corrections built in. Contracts traditionally specify a base price, such as the uranium spot price, and rules for escalation. In base-escalated contracts, the buyer and seller agree on a base price that escalates over time on the basis of an agreed-upon formula, which may take [[Economic indicators|economic indices]], such as [[GDP]] or [[inflation]] factors, into consideration.

A [[Spot price|spot market]] contract usually consists of just one delivery and is typically priced at or near the published spot market price at the time of purchase. However 85% of all uranium has been sold under long-term, multi-year contracts with deliveries starting one to three years after the [[contract]] is made. Long-term contract terms range from two to 10 years, but typically run three to five years, with the first delivery occurring within 24 months of contract award. They may also include a clause that allows the buyer to vary the size of each delivery within prescribed limits. For example, delivery quantities may vary from the prescribed annual volume by plus or minus 15%.

One of the peculiarities of the nuclear fuel cycle is the way in which utilities with nuclear power plants buy their fuel. Instead of buying [[Nuclear fuel#Common physical forms of nuclear fuel|fuel bundles]] from the fabricator, the usual approach is to purchase uranium in all of these intermediate forms. Typically, a fuel buyer from power utilities will contract separately with suppliers at each step of the process. Sometimes, the fuel buyer may purchase [[enriched uranium]] product, the end product of the first three stages, and contract separately for fabrication, the fourth step to eventually obtain the fuel in a form that can be loaded into the reactor. The utilities believe—rightly or wrongly—that these options offers them the best price and service. They will typically retain two or three suppliers for each stage of the fuel cycle, who compete for their business by tender. Sellers consist of suppliers in each of the four stages as well as brokers and [[Merchant|traders]]. There are fewer than 100 companies that buy and sell uranium in the western world.

In addition to being sold in different forms, uranium markets are differentiated by geography. The global trading of uranium has evolved into two distinct marketplaces shaped by historical and political forces. The first, the western world marketplace comprises the [[Americas]], [[Western Europe]] and Australia. A separate marketplace comprises countries within the former [[Soviet Union]], or the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (CIS), [[Eastern Europe]] and China. Most of the fuel requirements for [[nuclear power plant]]s in the CIS are supplied from the CIS's own stockpiles. Often producers within the CIS also supply uranium and fuel products to the western world, increasing competition.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He claims that [[fast breeder reactor]]s, fueled by naturally-replenished uranium extracted from seawater, could supply energy at least as long as the sun's expected remaining lifespan of five billion years.&lt;ref name="cohen83" /&gt;  These reactors use [[uranium-238]], which is more common than the [[uranium-235]] required by conventional reactors.
