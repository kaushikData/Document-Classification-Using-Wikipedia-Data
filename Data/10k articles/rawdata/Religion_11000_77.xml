'''Amy Beatrice Carmichael''' (16 December 1867 – 18 January 1951) was a [[Protestant]] [[Christian]] [[missionary]] in India, who opened an [[orphanage]] and founded a mission in [[Tamil Nadu|Dohnavur]]. She served in India for 55 years without [[furlough]] and wrote many books about the missionary work there.

==Early life==
Amy Beatrice Carmichael was born in the small village of [[Millisle]], [[County Down]], [[Ireland]] in 1867; her parents were David Carmichael, a miller and his wife Catherine. Her parents were devout [[Presbyterians]] and she was the oldest of seven siblings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ephrataministries.org/remnant-2001-11-amy-carmichael-of-dohnavur.a5w |title=Amy Carmichael of Dohnavur | work = Home History &amp;#124; The Heartbeat of the Remnant |publisher= Ephrata ministries | accessdate= 2015-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; One possibly apocryphal story claims that as a child, Amy wished that she had blue eyes rather than brown, and often prayed that Jesus would change her eye color and was disappointed when it never happened.  She loved to pinch her brother's cheeks to make the prettiest color blue in his eyes. But she always repented afterwards for hurting her brother. As an adult, however, she realized that her brown eye color probably helped her gain acceptance in India.{{citation needed |date=January 2014}}

Amy attended Harrogate Ladies College for four years in her youth. It was there she converted to Christianity at the age of fifteen. 

Amy's father moved the family to Belfast when she was 16, but he died two years later. In Belfast, the Carmichaels founded the [http://www.welcomechurch.co.uk/amy-carmichael-centre/ Welcome Evangelical Church].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.welcomechurch.co.uk/?page_id=14 |title=Amy Carmichael  |publisher= Welcome church | accessdate= 2015-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1880s, Carmichael started a Sunday-morning class for the ‘Shawlies’ (mill girls who wore shawls instead of hats) in the church hall of Rosemary Street Presbyterian. This mission grew and grew until they needed a hall to seat 500 people. At this time Amy saw an advertisement in ''The Christian'', for an iron hall that could be erected for £500 and would seat 500 people. Two donations, £500 from Miss Kate Mitchell and one plot of land from a mill owner, led to the erection of the first "Welcome Hall" on the corner of Cambrai Street and Heather Street in 1887.

Amy continued at the Welcome until she received a call to work among the mill girls of Manchester in 1889, from which she moved on to missionary work, although in many ways she seemed an unlikely candidate for missionary work, suffering as she did from [[neuralgia]], a disease of the  nerves that made her whole body weak and achy and often put her in bed for weeks on end. But at the [[Keswick Convention]] of 1887, she heard [[Hudson Taylor]], founder of the [[China Inland Mission]] speak about missionary life; soon afterwards, she became convinced of her calling to missionary work. She applied to the China Inland Mission and lived in London at the training house for women, where she met author and missionary to China, [[Mary Geraldine Guinness]], who encouraged her to pursue missionary work. She was ready to sail for Asia at one point, when it was determined that her health made her unfit for the work. She postponed her missionary career with the CIM and decided later to join the [[Church Missionary Society]].

==Work in India==
Initially Carmichael traveled to Japan for fifteen months, but fell ill and returned home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.missionfrontiers.org/issue/article/a-living-legacy |title=A Living Legacy:: Amy Carmichael and the Origin of the Dohnavur Fellowship |publisher=Mission Frontiers |date=1999-01-01 |accessdate=2015-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a brief period of service in Ceylon ([[Sri Lanka]]), she went to [[Bangalore]], India for her health and found her lifelong vocation. She was commissioned by the [[Church of England Zenana Mission]]. Carmichael's most notable work was with girls and young women, some of whom were saved from customs that amounted to [[forced prostitution]]. [[Hindu temple]] children were primarily young girls dedicated to the gods, then usually forced into prostitution to earn money for the priests (i.e., [[Devadasi]])&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/details/SlavesOfTheGodsMayo/page/n135&lt;/ref&gt;.

Carmichael founded the Dohnavur Fellowship&lt;ref&gt;http://dohnavurfellowship.org/project/santhosha_vidhyalaya/&lt;/ref&gt; in 1901 to continue her work&lt;ref&gt;http://dohnavurfellowship.org/&lt;/ref&gt;, as she later wrote in ''The Gold Cord'' (1932). A popular early work was ''Things as They Are: Mission Work in Southern India'' (1903). Dohnavur is situated in [[Tamil Nadu]], thirty miles from India's southern tip. The name derives from Count Dohna, who initially funded German missionaries at the site in the early 19th century, on which Rev. Thomas Walker then established a school. Carmichael's fellowship transformed Dohnavur into a sanctuary for over one thousand children who would otherwise have faced a bleak future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dohnavur.weebly.com/ |title=Welcome to Dohnavur - Home |publisher=Dohnavur.weebly.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carmichael often said that her [[Christian ministry|Ministry]] of rescuing temple children started with a girl named [[Preena]]. Having become a temple servant against her wishes, [[Preena]] managed to escape. Amy Carmichael provided her shelter and withstood the threats of those who insisted that the girl be returned either to the temple directly to continue her sexual assignments, or to her family for more indirect return to the temple. The number of such incidents soon grew, thus beginning Amy Carmichael's new [[Christian ministry|Ministry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://atgsociety.com/2010/03/amy-carmichael-rescuer-of-children/| title=Amy Carmichael:Rescuer of Children| publisher=atgsociety| accessdate=2012-06-27| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501194533/http://atgsociety.com/2010/03/amy-carmichael-rescuer-of-children/| archivedate=1 May 2011| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the children were asked what drew them to Amy, they most often replied "It was love. Amma (They’re refferring to Amy as their mother; Amma means mother) loved us."&lt;ref&gt;Introduction, by Elisabeth Elliot, The Collected Poems of Amy Carmichael CLC, Fort Washington, USA {{ISBN|0-87508-790-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Respecting Indian culture, members of the organization wore Indian dress and gave the rescued children Indian names. Carmichael herself dressed in Indian clothes, dyed her skin with dark coffee, and often traveled long distances on India's hot, dusty roads to save just one child from suffering.

While serving in India, Amy received a letter from a young lady who was considering life as a missionary. She asked Amy, "What is missionary life like?" Amy wrote back saying simply, "Missionary life is simply a chance to die." Nonetheless, in 1912 Queen Mary recognized the missionary's work, and helped fund a hospital at Dohnavur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.welcomechurch.co.uk/?page_id=14 |title=Amy Carmichael - Welcome |publisher=Welcomechurch.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1913, the Dohnavur Fellowship was serving 130 girls. In 1918, Dohnavur added a home for young boys, many born to the former temple prostitutes. Meanwhile, in 1916 Carmichael formed a Protestant religious order called Sisters of the Common Life.

==Final days and legacy==
In 1931, a fall severely injured Carmichael, and she remained bedridden for much of her final two decades. However, it did not stop her from continuing her inspirational writing, for she published 16 additional books (including ''His Thoughts Said . . . His Father Said'' (1951), ''If'' (1953), ''Edges of His Ways'' (1955) and ''God's Missionary'' (1957)), as well as revised others she had previously published. Biographers differ on the number of her published works, which may have reached 35 or as many as six dozen, although only a few remain in print today.

Carmichael died in [[India]] in 1951 at the age of 83.  She asked that no stone be put over her grave at Dohnavur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.findagrave.com/php/famous.php?page=cem&amp;FScemeteryid=2179809 |title=Dohnavur Fellowship |publisher=Find A Grave |date=1951-01-18 |accessdate=2015-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the children she had cared for put a [[bird bath]] over it with the single inscription "Amma", which means mother in the [[Tamil language|Tamil]] language&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP6tPj5aLcw&lt;/ref&gt;.

Her example as a missionary inspired others (including [[Jim Elliot]] and his wife [[Elisabeth Elliot]]) to pursue a similar vocation.&lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth Elliot, ''A Chance to Die: the Life and Legacy of Amy Carmichael.''&lt;/ref&gt; Many webpages include quotes from Carmichael's works, such as&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://simplychurch.com/some-quotes-from-one-of-my-heroines-amy-carmichael/ |title=Some quotes from one of my heroines-Amy Carmichael &amp;#124; Simply Church: A House Church Perspective |publisher=Simply Church |date=2013-12-11 |accessdate=2015-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://christian-quotes.ochristian.com/Amy-Carmichael-Quotes/ |title=Amy Carmichael Quotes |publisher=Christian-quotes.ochristian.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/3935881.Amy_Carmichael |title=Amy Carmichael Quotes (Author of If) |publisher=Goodreads.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{cquote|"It is a safe thing to trust Him to fulfill the desire that He creates."}}

[[India]] outlawed temple prostitution in 1948. However, the Dohnavur Fellowship continues, now supporting approximately 500 people on 400 acres with 16 nurseries and hospital. Rescued women can leave, or join the community, or return for important occasions, including the Christmas season. The foundation is now run by Indians under the jurisdiction of the [[Diocese of Tirunelveli of the Church of South India|C.S.I Tirunelveli Diocese]], founded in 1896. Changed policies acknowledging Indian law require that all children born in or brought to Dohnavur are sent out for education in the 6th grade. Furthermore, since 1982, baby boys are adopted out rather than remain in the community.

[[File:1 Hinayana style Aurangabad Buddhist Cave with stupa.jpg|thumb|[[Chaitya]] with [[stupa]], Cave IV (4), Aurangabad Caves]]
[[File:Aurangabad Caves.JPG|thumb|Aurangabad Caves, from a distance]]
The '''Aurangabad caves''' are twelve rock-cut [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] shrines located on a hill running roughly east to west, close to the city of [[Aurangabad, Maharashtra]]. The first reference to the Aurangabad Caves is in the great [[chaitya]] of [[Kanheri Caves]]. The Aurangabad Caves were dug out of comparatively soft [[basalt]] rock during the 6th and 7th century. 

The caves are divided into three separate groups depending on their location:&lt;ref name="Dulari Qureshi"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Qureshi |first1= Dulari |title= Art and Vision of Aurangabad Caves |publisher= Bhartiya Kala Prakashan|location= New Delhi |language= |isbn=81-86050-11-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; these are usually called the "Western Group", with Caves I to V (1 to 5), the "Eastern Group", with Caves VI to IX (6 to 9), and a "Northern Cluster", with the unfinished Caves X to XII (9 to 12).&lt;ref&gt;Fergusson, 385-392; Brancaccio, "Contents" etc&lt;/ref&gt;

The carvings at the Aurangabad Caves are notable for including Hinayana style stupa, Mahayana art work and [[Vajrayana]] goddess. These caves are among those in India that show 1st millennium CE Buddhist artwork with goddesses such as [[Durga]], and gods such as [[Ganesha]], although Buddhist caves in other parts of India with these arts are older.&lt;ref name="Brancaccio2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Pia Brancaccio|title=The Buddhist Caves at Aurangabad: Transformations in Art and Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m_4pXm7dD78C&amp;pg=PA206 |year=2010|publisher=BRILL Academic |isbn=90-04-18525-9|pages=21, 41, 150, 181, 190–192, 202–209 with footnotes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous Buddhist deities of the Tantra tradition are also carved in these caves.&lt;ref name="Brancaccio2010"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=David B. Gray|author2=Ryan Richard Overbey|title=Tantric Traditions in Transmission and Translation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OJWCCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA47 |year=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-990952-0|pages=47–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Introduction ==
The cave temples of Aurangabad cut between the 6th and the 8th century are nine kilometers from Aurangabad city center, a few kilometers from the campus of Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University and the Bibi-ka-Maqbara.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsarti.com/article/aurangabad-caves Aurangabad Caves] "The cave temples of Aurangabad cut between the 6th and the 8th century are nine kilometers from Aurangabad, near Bibi-ka-Maqbara."&lt;/ref&gt;

Carved in the Sihaychal ranges, the Aurangabad caves somewhat have been overshadowed by the UNESCO World Heritage monuments of [[Ellora Caves|Ellora]] and [[Ajanta Caves|Ajanta]] cave temples. Though its sculptures are comparable to Ajanta and Ellora, the caves are much smaller, more decrepit and less visited. Though in the 20th century, a few scholars started looking at these cave temples as a missing link between Ajanta and Ellora and also after an exhaustive study, were compelled to describe it as a " Sensitive remaking of life situated in time and space span".&lt;ref name="Dulari Qureshi"/&gt;
It is a protected monument under the Archaeological Survey of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb |url=http://asi.nic.in/asi_monu_tktd_maharashtra.asp|title= Aurangabad Caves|accessdate=2012-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Caves I and III==
"Caves I and III of Aurangabad and last caves of Ajanta co-existed as is apparent from striking parallels which we come across while examining both the sites. Again at Aurangabad after a careful study of both caves I and III, the conclusion the Historians have come to is that cave III was earlier to cave I. In Cave III the artist seems to have decorated with surprisingly neat and organized designs of fretwork, scrolls, panel of couples, tassels, flowers, geometrical designs, and highest point of perfection and consummation."&lt;ref&gt;Qureshi Dulari, "Art and Vision of Aurangabad Caves," Chapter I p.10&lt;/ref&gt;

{{For|the phrase used in Roman Catholicism|Confession (religion)}}
'''''Bless Me, Father''''' is a [[British sitcom]] starring [[Arthur Lowe]], [[Daniel Abineri]], [[Gabrielle Daye]], [[Patrick McAlinney]], [[David Ryall]], and [[Sheila Keith]]. It was aired on [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]] from 1978 until 1981 and described the adventures of an Irish [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] priest, Father Charles Duddleswell (Lowe) and his young curate (Abineri) in the fictional parish of [[Jude the Apostle|St. Jude]]'s in suburban London. Twenty-one episodes, written by Peter De Rosa (who had previously been a novice [[curate]]), were aired. De Rosa wrote the books on which the series was based using the pseudonym of Neil Boyd which was also the name of the young curate character; Boyd also served as the narrator in the series of novels upon which the series was based. It was made for the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network by [[London Weekend Television]].

The series was set in 1950 and 1951 and marked a departure from the middle-class "bank manager" roles associated with Lowe such as that in ''[[Dad's Army]]''. The other regular characters included Mrs Pring (Daye), the housekeeper, the hard-drinking Dr Daley (McAlinney), the non-religious neighbour Billy Buzzle (Ryall), and abbess Reverend Mother Stephen (Keith).

==Cast==
* [[Arthur Lowe]] as Father Charles Clement Duddleswell 
* [[Daniel Abineri]] as Father Neil Boyd
* [[Gabrielle Daye]] as Mrs. Pring
* [[Patrick McAlinney]] as Dr. Daley
* [[David Ryall]] as Billy Buzzle
* [[Sheila Keith]] as Mother Stephen

Guest appearances on the series include [[Derek Francis]], [[Phoebe Nicholls]], [[Daniel Gerroll]], [[Peter Bowles]], [[Clive Swift]], [[Rynagh O'Grady]], [[Michael Troughton]], [[Geoffrey Palmer (actor)|Geoffrey Palmer]] and [[Peter Copley]].

In her 1973 book ''Folk-lore and Folk-tales of Wales'', Marie Trevelyan says that the Ceffyl Dŵr was believed to [[Shapeshifting|shapeshift]] and even fly, although this varies depending on region. For example, in [[North Wales]] he is represented as being rather formidable with fiery eyes and a dark forbidding presence, whereas in [[South Wales]] he is seen more positively as, at worst a cheeky pest to travelers and at best, as Trevelyan puts it, "luminous, fascinating and sometimes a winged steed".{{sfnp|Trevelyan|1973|p=64}}

The Ceffyl Dŵr is said to inhabit mountain pools and waterfalls. Even though it appears solid, it can evaporate into the mist. In one form of the legend the Ceffyl Dŵr, as a horse, leaps out of the water to trample and kill lone travelers.{{sfnp|Rose|2001|p=71}}

Another form of the legend reports that the Ceffyl Dŵr entices the unwary traveler to ride him. Flying into the air, the Ceffyl Dŵr evaporates, dropping the unfortunate rider to his death.{{sfnp|Evans|1887|pp=170–171}}

A '''''chavurah''''' or '''''havurah'''''  (חבורה [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: "fellowship", plural ''chavurot'') is a small group of like-minded [[Jew]]s who assemble for the purposes of facilitating [[Shabbat]] and [[Jewish holiday|holiday]] prayer services, sharing communal experiences such as lifecycle events, or Jewish learning. ''Chavurot'' usually provide autonomous alternatives to established Jewish institutions and [[Jewish denominations]]. Most chavurot place an emphasis on [[egalitarianism]] in the broad sense (of which gender egalitarianism is one piece), depending on participation by the entire community rather than top-down direction by clergy.

==Origins==

The first havurah in America was formed in September 1960 in [[Whittier, California|Whittier]], California.&lt;ref&gt;Weiner, Rex. "[http://forward.com/articles/139829/ Whittier Celebrates the Last Hurrah of America’s First Havurah]". ''Forward''. The Forward Association, Inc. July 13, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; However, most chavurot in America had their origins in the North American Jewish counter-cultural trends of the late 1960s and early 1970s. During this period, groups of young rabbis, academics, and political activists founded experimental chavurot for prayer and study, in reaction to what they perceived as an over-institutionalized and unspiritual North American Jewish establishment. Initially the main inspiration was the pietistic fellowships of the Pharisees and other ancient Jewish sects.

Initially some of these groups, like the Boston-area [[Havurat Shalom]], attempted to function as full-fledged rural communes after the model of their secular counterparts. Others formed as communities within the urban or suburban Jewish establishment. Although the leadership and ritual privileges were initially men-only, as in Orthodox Jewish practice, the "second wave" of American feminism soon led to the full integration of women in these communities.

==Literature==

Apart from some tentative articles in ''Response''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Response: A contemporary Jewish review|url=http://hufind.huji.ac.il/Record/HUJ000250090/Description|work=HUFind|publisher=Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel|accessdate=17 February 2014|quote=Publication Frequency: Irregular.}} Evidently distinct from the Simon Wiesenthal Center's [[Simon_Wiesenthal_Center#Name_and_leadership|''Response'' Magazine]].&lt;/ref&gt; and other Jewish student magazines, the early chavurot attracted little attention in the wider North American Jewish community. Then, in 1973, Michael and Sharon Strassfeld released ''The Jewish Catalog: A Do-It-Yourself Kit.''  Patterned after the recently published counter-culture [[Whole Earth Catalog]], the book served both as a basic reference on [[Judaism]] and American Jewish life, as well as a playful compendium of Jewish crafts, recipes, meditational practices, and political action ideas, all aimed at disaffected young Jewish adults. ''The Jewish Catalog'' became one of the best-selling books in American Jewish history to that date and spawned two sequels. A much more widespread chavurah movement soon emerged, including self-governing chavurot within Reform, Conservative and Reconstructionist synagogues.

==Present==

Present-day chavurot include some chavurot that have functioned continuously since the 1970s, such as Fabrangen&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fabrangen.org|title=Fabrangen - An Independent, Egalitarian, Participatory Havurah - Washington DC -|website=www.fabrangen.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Havurat Shalom, as well as a resurgent wave in [[independent minyan|independent Jewish communities]] that have been established post-2000.  Both generations of chavurot gather annually at the National Havurah Committee's Summer Institute and at its regional retreats.

==Origin of term==

The concept of a Chavurah has ancient roots. The [[Talmud]] (Tractate ''Pesachim'') uses the term ''chavurah'' to identify the group of people registered for a single [[Passover]] [[korbanot|sacrifice]], and who held a [[Passover Seder|Seder]] together, in the days of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]]. The Passover Seder is perhaps the prototypical group ritual (traditionally) held outside a synagogue involving the sharing of communal experiences, Jewish learning, and prayer.

'''ChristianFilmDatabase.com, LLC''' ('''CFDb''') is an [[online database]] of [[Christian films]] and their associated information. It was designed to be a [[Christian]] version of the [[Internet Movie Database]].

== History of the CFDb website ==
CFDb was founded in 2008 by Roger Rudlaff &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://boxoffice.com/featured_stories/2010/01/pressing-on.php |title=Pressing On |last=Toto |first=Christian |date=January 27, 2010 |work=[[Boxoffice (magazine)|Boxoffice]] |accessdate=January 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; who had previously created "The Wayhouse Christian Film Library", a library that lent Christian movies to the public.&lt;ref name="Podger"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roanoke.com/news/roanoke/wb/110760 |title=Faith-based video lending libraries on increase |last=Podger |first=Pamela J. |date=March 29, 2007 |work=[[The Roanoke Times]] |accessdate=January 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He and his wife Annelie Rudlaff started "The Wayhouse [[Christian]] Film Library" in 2001 by loaning out [[Christian]] books and [[VHS]] movies in [[Buena Vista, Colorado]] out of their home and showing a few films to the public in their town's [[chamber of commerce]] building. They later moved to [[Roanoke, Virginia]], where they re-opened in 2006.&lt;ref name="Podger"/&gt; While the Rudlaffs were running this lending library, Roger Rudlaff had difficulty finding certain Christian films, because the different films he searched for were scattered on many different websites. He started a specialist Christian films website called CFDb, after doing some research on [[IMDb]]. He was unable to claim the title of CMDb, because that [[domain name]] was taken by another [[Christian music]] website. He registered the CFDb domain name in 2008 and on Feb. 25 2011, the company became a LLC.

The database includes information on the films such as release date, running time, [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|MPAA rating]], formats, [[film director]], [[film producer]], [[screenwriter]], [[film score composer]], [[cinematographer]], language and subtitles, film production company, [[film distribution company]], cast, [[film trailer]], film website, [[Facebook]] page, [[Twitter]] page, [[Film criticism|movie reviews]], contact info, and synopsis.

In March 2012 the company made informal agreements with "Cruciflicks" and with "Indy Christian Review" for sharing Christian [[Film criticism|movie review]] content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cruciflicks.wordpress.com/2012/03/11/cruciflicks-partners-with-cfdb/ |title=Cruciflicks Partners With CFDb |last=Vaught |first=Lance |date=March 11, 2012 |work=[Cruciflicks] |accessdate=May 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2012, CFDb signed an exclusive deal with [[Christian Book Distributors]] to sell the films listed on CFDb via Christian Book Distributors' website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.christianfilmdatabase.com/cfdb-news/cfdb-partners-with-cbd-christian-book-distributors-our-new-online-store/ |title=CFDb makes exclusive deal with Christian Book Distributors |last=Rudlaff |first=Annelie |date=May 2012 |work=[CFDb blog] |accessdate=November 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 13, 2013 CFDb and the [[crowdfunding]] website FaithLauncher announced a strategic alliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2013/3/prweb10525410.htm |title=CFDb, Christian Film Database And Crowdfunding Website, FaithLauncher Form Strategic Alliance |last=Chavez  |first=Fernando |date=March 13, 2013 |work=FaithLauncher |accessdate=March 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criteria for inclusion ==
According to their website, the CFDb states that they are a [[non-denominational]] list of what they call "Christian films" and that "We list all films with a Christian message, it does not matter who makes it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Christian Movies All in One Place, Easy to Find! CFDb!|url=http://www.christianfilmdatabase.com/|publisher=www.christianfilmdatabase.com|accessdate=17 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CFDb states that two of their criteria for being a Christian film are: 1. "The film must show a need for [[God]], [[Jesus]], or the [[Holy Spirit]] in some way." 2. "The film is marketed to the  Christian Community, therefore  Christians  will be searching for it on the database." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.christianfilmdatabase.com/christian-movie-news/cfdb-guidelines-what-films-get-posted-to-cfdb/ |title=CFDb Guidelines: What films get posted to CFDb |last=Rudlaff |first=Annelie |date=October 9, 2012 |work=Christian Film Database |accessdate=March 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Number of films ==
On January 1, 2010, there were approximately 1,250 films listed on CFDb, with more added weekly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogcritics.org/video/article/interview-with-roger-rudlaff-of-the/ |title=Interview with Roger Rudlaff of the Christian Film Database |last=Biddinger |first=J.J. |date=January 1, 2010 |work=[[Blogcritics]] |accessdate=January 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rudlaff said, "I list films in many formats, like [[16 mm film|16mm]], [[VHS]], [[DVD]], and now [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] and (VOD) [[Video on Demand]]" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.christiancinema.com/catalog/newsdesk_info.php?newsdesk_id=1239 |title=Video Ministry Becomes Christian Film Database |last=Walker |first=Angela |date=January 8, 2010 |work=[[ChristianCinema.com]] |accessdate=January 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of January 2013, CFDb had over 1600 films listed, some of which have multiple film titles listed on one page as a series: these are counted as a single film.

== Rankings (CFDb's top 100) ==
In December 2012, the CFDb released its list of the top 100 Christian films for 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.christianfilmworksmag.com/index.php?p=1_9_CFDb/ |title=Christian Film Database makes Cover Story Christian Filmworks Magazine January 2013 issue |last=Wolf |first=Susan |date=January 1, 2013 |work=Christian Filmworks Magazine |accessdate=January 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rudlaff"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.christiannewswire.com/news/634071297.html |title=Christian Film Database Releases Top 100 Films of 2012 |last=Rudlaff |first=Annelie |date=January 18, 2013 |work=Christian News Wire |accessdate=January 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Church of Scientology Flag Service Organization''', also known as '''Flag''' or '''FSO''', is an American 501(c)(3) [[non-profit corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;[[commons:File:IRS-Recognition-Denmark.djvu|Letter by the Internal Revenue Service to Flemming Paludan, Regional Director, Danish Tax-Office, Washington, D.C., USA, December 22nd, 1993]]&lt;/ref&gt; Within the worldwide network of Scientology [[corporations]] and [[entities]], the FSO is officially referred to as the "[[Spirituality|spiritual]] [[headquarters]]" of the [[Church of Scientology]]. The organization is located in Clearwater, Florida.&lt;ref name="fso.org"&gt;[http://www.fso.org/ Information from the official website of the Church of Scientology Flag Service Organization, retrieved on April 7th, 2008] "Church of Scientology Flag Service Organization 210 South Fort Harrison Ave. Clearwater, Florida 33756 USA 727-445-4387"&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the official website of the Church of Scientology,  "the Flag Service Organization (FSO) is a religious retreat which serves as the spiritual headquarters for Scientologists from all over the world. It is the hub of the Scientology worldwide community, a dynamic, multilingual organization and is the largest single Church of Scientology in the world with well over 1,000 staff members."  Additionally, the FSO "delivers Dianetics and Scientology [[Service (economics)|services]] from the very bottom of [[The Bridge to Total Freedom|The Bridge]] to the top, as well as certain specialized [[Auditing (Scientology)|auditing]] services only available here.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fso.org/ Excerpts from the official website of the Church of Scientology Flag Service Organization, retrieved on April 7th, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;"

In a memorandum provided to the [[Internal Revenue Service]], the Church of Scientology International explained the role and the functions of the FSO as follows: &lt;blockquote&gt;"'Flag' in CSFSO's name originates from the Flag Service Organization's earliest ecclesiastical beginnings in 1967 aboard the Flag Ship [[Apollo (Sea Org ship)|Apollo]] and the name was maintained as tradition when the land-based organization was established. CSFSO ministers the highest levels of [[auditor]] training through Class XII and auditing through New [[Operating Thetan|OT]] VII. It serves as the spiritual headquarters for [[Scientologists]] from all over the world who travel there to participate in religious services. [...]&lt;ref&gt;[[:Image:CSI-Description-FSO.pdf|Description of the Church of Scientology Flag Service Org, Inc., Form 1023, Attached Statement, page 39 - 42, Los Angeles, California, August 18th, 1993]]&lt;/ref&gt;"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In another 1993 [[memorandum]] by the Church of Scientology International, the following information was provided to the Internal Revenue Service with regards to FSO's personnel and its income:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"[...] CSFSO [...] ministers high levels of religious services to parishioners from around the world from facilities in Clearwater, Florida. This church has a staff of approximately 449 individuals and an annual budget of approximately $ 81.3 million, based on its annual disbursements for the most recent year for which financial statements are available. [...]"&lt;ref&gt;[[:Image:Summary Description RTC-CSI.pdf|Summary Description of Churches of Scientology - RTC, CSI, CSFSSO, CSFSO, Other Churches, Missions, Field Ministers, CSI Prod. 11-4-93, Bate Stamp: 151396 - 151398, Ex. 1-3, Washington, DC, 1993]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Corporate information==
The FSO was incorporated in Florida on May 19, 1981.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sunbiz.org/scripts/cordet.exe?action=DETFIL&amp;inq_doc_number=758400&amp;inq_came_from=NAMFWD&amp;cor_web_names_seq_number=0000&amp;names_name_ind=N&amp;names_cor_number=&amp;names_name_seq=&amp;names_name_ind=&amp;names_comp_name=CHURCHSCIENTOLOGYFLAGSER&amp;names_filing_type= Filing Information - Church of Scientology Flag Service Organization, Florida Department of State, Division of Corporations, retrieved on April 7th, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; On September 21, 1993 the following individuals held [[corporate]] positions at the organization: The [[Board of Trustees]] was composed of Sue Price, Pam Hubbert and Richard Reiss. The members of the [[Board of Directors]] at that time were Catherine Probst, Allen Hubbert and Debbie Cook. The [[corporation|corporation's]] President was Alicia Danilovich, its Secretary and [[Treasurer]] Catherine Probst.{{Citation needed| date=July 2012}} As of April 28, 2009, FSO's corporative officers were Lena Lind (President), Harvey Jacques (Director), Peter Mansell (Director), Glen Stilo ([[Secretary]]) and Barbara Meador (Treasurer &amp; Director). FSO's registered [[Agent (law)|agent]] is currently Robert V. Potter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sunbiz.org/COR/2009/0430/53339786.tif Filing Information - Church of Scientology Flag Service Organization, Florida Department of State, Division of Corporations, retrieved on June 17th, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 18, 1993, the FSO filed an application for [[tax exemption]] under section [[501(c)#501(c)(3)|501(c)(3)]] of the [[Internal Revenue Code]].{{Citation needed| date=July 2012}} The Internal Revenue Service granted FSO's request for exemption through an official recognition letter on October 1, 1993.&lt;ref&gt;[[commons:File:FSO-IRS-Recognition.djvu|Recognition Letter for 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status - Church of Scientology Flag Service Organization, Inc., Bate Stamp: 236340 - 236343, Washington, DC, October 1st, 1993]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Religious Technology Center]] (RTC) holds the [[trademarks]] and [[service marks]] of Scientology. As such, RTC entered an organizational [[Covenant (law)|covenant]] with the FSO on January 1, 1982, granting FSO the right to sell and deliver the "Advanced Technology" to its public members while guaranteeing weekly payments to the RTC of 6% of the monetary value of the "Advanced Technology"-services delivered by the FSO.{{Citation needed| date=July 2012}}

The [[Church of Scientology International]] (CSI) presents itself as the [[mother church]] of the Church of Scientology worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientology.org/religion/management/pg003.html The Church of Scientology International/What is Scientology? - official website, retrieved on March 24th, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; As such, it has the right to use and sub-license various Scientology trademarks and service marks. Consequently, CSI has entered a number of agreements with other [[subordinate]] organizations in the Scientology [[hierarchy]], such as  the FSO:
*"[[License]] Agreement". This agreement from May 26, 1982 regulates the use of the service marks and trademarks by the FSO.{{Citation needed| date=July 2012}}
*"[[Ecclesiastical]] Support Agreement". This agreement from January 1, 1992 acknowledges CSI's dominant role and control over all the functions and activities of the FSO and guarantees a steady, weekly payment of 12.5% of the organizations' net income towards CSI.{{Citation needed| date=July 2012}}
*"[[Motion Picture]] Exhibition Agreement". It guarantees CSI the weekly payment of 11% of the [[revenue]] by the FSO for their use of Scientology training courses. It also forces the organizations to use certain equipment, such as tape recorders, which CSI provides.{{Citation needed| date=July 2012}}

== Organizational Structure and Management ==

According to its 1993 application for tax exemption, the corporation "Church of Scientology Flag Service Organization, Inc." consisted at that time of the following four different sub-organizations or sub-entities:{{Citation needed| date=July 2012}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;"[...] 1. Flag Service Org. Flag Service Org ministers religious services to CSFSO's parishioners. This ecclesiastical body includes all of the auditors, case supervisors, course supervisors and other staff directly involved in ministering services, as well as executive and administrative staff that perform necessary support functions such as personnel, communications, ethics, treasury and finances, administration and dissemination. The highest ecclesiastical position in the Flag Service Org is its Captain, who, together with her deputies and other top executives form its executive council, the highest ecclesiastical body in the organization. Beneath the executive council is an advisory council, comprising the heads of each of the Flag Service Org's divisions. These two bodies, subject to ecclesiastical management advice and direction from senior ecclesiastical organizations [...], direct the day-to-day and week-to-week activities of the Flag Service Org."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"2. Flag Crew Org. The Flag Crew Org performs direct support functions for Flag Service Org and other ecclesiastical
bodies within CSFSO. The Flag Crew Org maintains the buildings and property of CSFSO; maintains and operates the accommodations and food facilities of CSFSO's religious retreat; and berths, feeds and otherwise communally supports CSFSO's staff. The Flag Crew Org has its own captain, executive council and advisory council which direct its activities."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"3. Flag Land Base. Flag Land Base is an ecclesiastical body within CSFSO that is senior to both the Flag Service Org and Flag Crew Org. Flag Land Base is composed of a number of executive CSFSO staff personnel responsible for the overall direction and coordination of CSFSO as a whole. This body is headed by the Commanding Officer Flag Land Base, who is the highest ecclesiastical official in CSFSO's hierarchy. Whereas the Captains of the Flag Service Org and Flag Crew Org are primarily concerned with the activities of their respective ecclesiastical organizations, the Commanding Officer Flag Land Base and his staff consider CSFSO's activities as a whole."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"4. Commodore's Messenger Org Clearwater (CMO CW). CMO CW oversees and ensures the implementation of programs that CSFSO receives from the Commodore's Messenger Org International, an ecclesiastical body within CSI. These programs can relate to all facets of CSFSO's activities from the conduct of religious services to the acquisition and renovation of buildings, and unusual or ongoing legal or financial matters. [...]"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Corporate Management'''

During the past years, CoSFSO Inc. was managed by the following corporate officers. The [[column]] "Year" of the following table refers to the date of the filing of the annual report for not-for-profit corporations with the [[Secretary of State]] for the [[Florida|State of Florida]].

In 1993, Catherine Probst held both the position of Treasurer and Secretary. During the years 1995 and 1996 Barbara Meador and Marsha Lovering held the positions of Treasurer and Secretary. In 1997 Glen Stilo replaced Lovering as Secretary, while Meador continued as Treasurer. Since then, these two positions remained unchanged.

== Lisa McPherson Controversy ==

In 1995 [[Death of Lisa McPherson|Lisa McPherson]] died while in the care of the FSO. The FSO was indicted on two felony charges and found not guilty. McPherson's cause of death was changed from "undetermined" to "accident" in 2000.

|quote=Dangerous program / In a letter to Fence Post (Dec. 12), Susan Stozewski of the Chicago Church of Scientology attempts to promote a drug rehab program called Narconon. I wish to warn readers that Narconon is a front group for the Church of Scientology.  I found from personal experience that Narconon is a sham and is, in fact, a slick device to lure unsuspecting people into Scientology. An acquaintance of mine recently discovered that she had serious liver damage from Narconon's bogus "purification" program and she now cannot get health insurance coverage.  Another Scientology front group to beware of is the CCHR or Citizens Commission on Human Rights. The CCHR is using tax-exempt funds in a covert campaign to discredit psychiatric-psychology treatment. The CCHR has an extensive network of agents that are distributing distortions about psychiatric treatment and medications such as Prozac and Ritalin. This is a very dangerous thing and people should be aware that it is going on. / Jim Beebe / Northbrook

|quote=The petition sought the removal of Prozac (fluoxetine hydrochloride, Dista) from the market and was filed in October 1990 by the Citizens Commission on Human Rights (CCHR), a Scientology front group. The FDA is to be commended on its careful review of pertinent scientific data, which led to this most recent reaffirmation of the safety and effectiveness of Prozac.  From the start, the campaign against Prozac, of which the CCHR petition was a part, has been a dangerous deception. Scientology's disinformation is a menace to the public health as it attempts to frighten patients away from appropriate medical care and safe and effective medicines.

==Efforts for psychiatric reform==
[[File:Cchr flyer.png|right|thumb|250px|CCHR promotional leaflet, inviting members of the public to "report psychiatric abuse"]]
The CCHR achieved an early victory in a 1969 [[Pennsylvania]] case involving Victor Győry, a Hungarian refugee who had been [[involuntary commitment|committed to a psychiatric hospital against his will]] in April of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=60kmAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=yv4FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=917,6467089|title=Gettysburg Times - Google News Archive Search|author=|date=|website=news.google.com|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DelCou1970" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GazTel"&gt;{{cite news |first=Larry|last=Ferguson|url=|title=CCHR Using Publicity to Improve Mental Care |work=[[Colorado Springs Gazette Telegraph]]|date=5 July 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; The police officers committing Győry said he had tried to kill himself.&lt;ref name="GazTel" /&gt; Doctors at [[Haverford State Hospital]], failing to realise that Győry spoke very little English and was trying to address them in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], judged him "incoherent" and diagnosed him as a [[paranoid schizophrenia|paranoid schizophrenic]].&lt;ref name="Ruble1975"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Ruble|title=Christian perspectives on psychology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JTKMvj27w5gC&amp;pg=PA129|accessdate=4 January 2011|date=1 June 1975|publisher=Ardent Media|isbn=978-0-8422-0456-9|pages=129–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hospital refused Győry's request for legal representation, and administered drugs and [[electroshock treatment]] to him against his will over a three-month period.&lt;ref name="DelCou1970"&gt;{{cite news |first=Marlene|last=Fazio|url=|title=Three Hospital Aides Reinstated |work=[[Delaware County Daily Times]]|date=6 January 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GazTel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DelCou1969"&gt;{{cite news |first=Julius|last=Nicholas|url=|title=Patient Wants Court to Forbid Shock Treatment |work=[[Delaware County Daily Times]]|date=23 July 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; An aide at the hospital eventually notified the CCHR, who, under an initiative led by Szasz and lawyer [[John Joseph Matonis]], took the case to court and secured Győry's release.&lt;ref name="GazTel" /&gt;

The CCHR continued to lobby for legislative reform on mental health issues such as the keeping of detailed computer records on involuntarily committed patients and their families, and "drug experimentation" without patients' consent.&lt;ref name="GazTel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="swar"&gt;[http://dir.salon.com/news/feature/2005/07/01/sci_psy Scientology's War on Psychiatry]," ''Salon'', 1 July 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The CCHR would typically request a tour of a psychiatric hospital, issue a public report based on patient testimony and other sources, and then push for legal investigations and reform.&lt;ref name="GazTel" /&gt; Its early focus was on involuntary commitment procedures.&lt;ref name="GazTel" /&gt;

Since then, the group has organized media campaigns against various psychiatrists, psychiatric organizations and pharmaceutical companies, including [[Eli Lilly and Company|Eli Lilly]], the manufacturer of [[Prozac]]. One campaign is said to have caused a major fall in sales of Prozac, causing considerable commercial damage to the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Thomas M.|last=Burton |url= |title=Anti-Depression Drug Of Eli Lilly Loses Sales After Attack by Sect |date=19 April 1991 |work= Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group campaigned against the use of [[Ritalin]] for the [[Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder management|treatment]] of [[attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder]], a disorder which the organization [[Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder controversies#Status as a disorder|dismisses as nonexistent]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Library/Shelf/la90/la90-6b.html Suits, Protests Fuel a Campaign Against Psychiatry], Los Angeles Times, 29 June 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dhawleshka"&gt;{{cite news |first=Danylo|last=Hawleshka|url=http://www.macleans.ca/article.jsp?content=20060515_126736_126736 |title=A new war over Ritalin |date=10 May 2006|accessdate=7 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rollcall.com/issues/48_88/-1460-1.html Kennedy Takes Aim at Ritalin Provision], Roll Call, 7 May 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign was part of the [[Ritalin class action lawsuits]] against [[Novartis]] (the manufacturer of Ritalin), [[CHADD]], and the [[American Psychiatric Association]] (APA); all five lawsuits were dismissed in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;317 F.3d 1097; 2003 U.S. App. LEXIS 1678; 54 Fed. R. Serv. 3d (Callaghan) 1032; 2003 Cal. Daily Op. Service 970; 2003 Daily Journal DAR 1265.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the CCHR presented a report with the title "The Silent Death of America's Children" to the [[New Freedom Commission on Mental Health]], with case histories of several dozen under-aged psychiatric patients who had died as a result of [[psychotropic]] drug treatment and restraint measures in the 1990s and early 2000s.&lt;ref name="Thompson2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Marie L.

In 2004, the CCHR sponsored a bill requiring doctors to provide patients with information about a medication's side effects before prescribing any psychotropic drugs, while also mandating a legal guardian's signature.&lt;ref name="bgedan" /&gt; Opponents of the bill argued that these additional procedures might discriminate against mentally-ill patients while delaying treatment.&lt;ref name="bgedan" /&gt; The bill attracted widespread disagreement from the medical establishment, including the [[Massachusetts Department of Mental Health]], who opposed it on the grounds that it compromised [[informed consent]].&lt;ref name="bgedan" /&gt; The [[Massachusetts Psychiatric Society]] also opposed the bill, believing that it would interfere with the doctor-patient relationship.&lt;ref name="bgedan" /&gt;

On 5 October 2006, National Mental Health Screening Day, the CCHR picketed outside of Riverside Community Care in [[Wakefield, Massachusetts|Wakefield]], [[Massachusetts]], holding a [[New Freedom Commission on Mental Health|protest rally against mental health screening]]. According to journalist Gary Band in the ''Wakefield Observer'', "The protest fell somewhat flat because Riverside has not conducted these screenings since 2001."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.townonline.com/wakefield/localRegional/view.bg?articleid=591117|title=- Wicked Local|author=|date=|website=Wicked Local|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a report from the National Center for Biotechnology Information&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=A war over mental health professionalism: Scientology versus psychiatry|pmc=3856510 | pmid=24348087|doi=10.1080/13674676.2012.737552|volume=17|journal=Ment Health Relig Cult|pages=1–23 | last1 = Kent | first1 = SA | last2 = Manca | first2 = TA}}&lt;/ref&gt; the CCHR has uncovered real cases of faulty psychiatric care, which gave them some credibility; conversely, the CCHR has been accused of using pseudo-science {{citation-needed|date=May 2018}} and false information {{citation-needed|date=May 2018}} to disingenuously validate their claims .

===Chelmsford Hospital and DST===
From 1988 to 1990 the Australian government held the [[Chelmsford Royal Commission]] inquiry into [[Deep Sleep Therapy]] (DST). For a decade prior, the CCHR had been pushing for an investigation of the [[Chelmsford Private Hospital]] in New South Wales, and its head, Dr. [[Harry Bailey]], who had been practising DST from 1963 to 1979.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adbonline.anu.edu.au/biogs/A170047b.htm] Australian Dictionary of Biography-Bailey, Harry Richard, pp 48-49, Melbourne University Press&lt;/ref&gt;
Honorable Justice John (J. P.) Slattery, Royal Commissioner, is quoted as stating that the CCHR "contributed considerably to advance the cause of the Chelmsford patients in their campaign for an open inquiry into the hospital."{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} The inquiry discovered that deep sleep therapy had killed 24 patients, not counting patients who had killed themselves, and close to a thousand had suffered brain damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/parlment/hansart.nsf/V3Key/LA19911202019 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070922111905/http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/PARLMENT/hansArt.nsf/V3Key/LA19911202019 |archivedate=22 September 2007 |df= }} Chelmsford Private Hospital Patient Compensation-New South Wales Parliament-22 April 1991&lt;/ref&gt; Of the former patients, 152 received reparations from a fund totaling in excess of 5 million dollars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://suburbia.net/~fun/scn/books/inside-60-minutes.html] 'Inside 60 Minutes'&lt;/ref&gt;

Chelmsford Hospital was forced to close in 1990, and two of its psychiatric staff were made to face charges in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1993/77.html] Walton v. Gardiner, Herron and McDonald (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Bailey himself stepped down in 1979 due to the CCHR's protest campaign, and committed suicide by drug overdose in 1985, the night before he was subpoenaed to appear in court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adbonline.anu.edu.au/biogs/A170047b.htm] Australian Dictionary of Biography, Bailey, Harry Richard, pp 48-49, Melbourne University Press&lt;/ref&gt; His suicide note read, in part: "Let it be known that the Scientologists and the forces of madness have won."&lt;ref&gt;''The Melbourne Age'', 22 April 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Documentaries==
CCHR have produced a number of documentaries promoting their view of modern psychiatry. These include ''Making A Killing'', ''Prescription for Violence'', ''The Marketing of Madness'', ''Dead Wrong'', and ''Psychiatry: An Industry of Death'', which was made to accompany the CCHR's [[Psychiatry: An Industry of Death|museum of the same name.]]

==={{anchor|MarketingMadness}}''The Marketing of Madness: Are We All Insane?''===
''The Marketing of Madness'' is a documentary which alleges that the mental health industry is an unscientific field driven solely by the [[profit motive]], to the detriment of [[patients]].

One of the interviewees is Claudia Keyworth, an advocate of '[[Vitalism#Alternative medicine|Bio-Energetic medicine]]' who believes that healing is best accomplished using the "energy field of the human body".&lt;ref&gt;[http://drclaudiaheals.com/DrClaudiaHeals/About_Us.html Doctor Claudia Heals website, especially the Home and About Us pages] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001034547/http://drclaudiaheals.com/DrClaudiaHeals/About_Us.html |date=1 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the topic of mental illness, she asserts: "they say you have a chemical imbalance of serotonin and dopamine, but there's never been a study to prove that, ever."

However, a substantial volume of research does support the prevailing view among [[experts]], which is that [[Biology of depression#Monoamines|monoamines]] do in fact play a role in various mental disorders (see also [[Biology of depression]], and [[Causes of mental disorders]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=St. Jude Children's Research Hospital|title=Disruption of gene interaction linked to schizophrenia |accessdate=6 July 2006 |url=http://www.innovations-report.com/html/reports/life_sciences/report-52499.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Lieberman | first = J.A. |author2=JM Kane |author3=J.

The documentary claims that psychiatrists have convinced the public that normal negative human experiences are mental illnesses. An example used in the movie is the assertion that psychiatrists seek to label typical shyness as a "[[social anxiety disorder]]"; however, patients are diagnosed with a social anxiety disorder only at debilitating levels, where there is an "''intense'' fear in social situations".&lt;ref name="webmd.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/anxiety-panic/guide/mental-health-social-anxiety-disorder|title=Webmd. Mental Health: Social Anxiety Disorder |publisher=Webmd.com|accessdate=14 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike a shy individual, a person diagnosed with social anxiety ''disorder'' is likely to suffer from symptoms such as [[nausea]], [[stammering]], and [[panic attacks]].

==Controversies and criticisms==
The CCHR is often characterized as a front group for the Church of Scientology, which sponsors the organization.&lt;ref name="one" /&gt;&lt;ref name="two" /&gt;&lt;ref name="three" /&gt;&lt;ref name="four" /&gt;&lt;ref name="five" /&gt;&lt;ref name="six" /&gt;&lt;ref name="seven" /&gt;&lt;ref name="eight" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GlobeandMail"&gt;{{cite news|title=Scientology faces wave of cyber attacks|accessdate=23 September 2012|newspaper=Cape Times|date=4 March 2008|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-175951837.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, the US [[Internal Revenue Service]] granted CCHR [[tax exemption]] as part of an agreement with the [[Church of Scientology International]] and [[Religious Technology Center]] (RTC) under which the RTC took responsibility for CCHR's tax liabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Touretzky|first=Dave|title=CoS / IRS Closing Agreement|url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Secrets/irs-closing.html|publisher=[[Operation Clambake]]|accessdate=24 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CCHR has been criticized by journalist Andrew Gumbel for "crudeness" and "paranoia" in its criticism of psychiatry.&lt;ref name="Gumbel"&gt;{{cite news |first = Andrew |last = Gumbel |url = http://www.lacitybeat.com/article.php?id=3137&amp;IssueNum=136 |title = Scientology vs. Science |work = [[Los Angeles CityBeat]] | publisher = Southland Publishing |date = 2006-01-12 |accessdate = 2006-06-08 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060427102908/http://www.lacitybeat.com/article.php?id=3137&amp;IssueNum=136 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two scholars featured in the film ''[[Psychiatry: An Industry of Death#Film|Psychiatry: An Industry of Death]]'', [[Holocaust]] scholar [[Michael Berenbaum]] and [[bioethics]] scholar [[Arthur Caplan]], have rejected the attack on psychiatry and psychology. Berenbaum stated that "I have known psychiatrists to be of enormous assistance to people deeply important to me in my life," and Caplan complained that he had been taped without being told what the film was about, and called the producers "smarmy and dishonest."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071009005335/http://www.sameritech.com/tribunearchive/3-22-07.pdf  Funny? Yes, And Quite Weird, Too], Tampa Tribune, Mar 22, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, the CCHR claimed that Professor Sir [[Martin Roth (psychiatrist)|Martin Roth]] of [[University of Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle University]] had used [[LSD]] in tests on mental patients in the 1960s. The statements were publicized in the ''Northern Echo'' newspaper, which was ordered by an English court to pay "very substantial" [[libel]] damages to Roth after the court found that CCHR's claims were "highly defamatory" and "utterly false."&lt;ref name="northernecho"&gt;{{cite news |work=Northern Echo |publisher= |title=Prof's Libel Victory Over LSD Claims |date=22 June 1990 |url=http://www.planetkc.com/sloth/sci/cchr.libel |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070717192650/www.planetkc.com/sloth/sci/cchr.libel |archivedate=2007-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jan Eastgate, President of the CCHR and winner of the [[Church of Scientology]] Freedom Medal, has been implicated in covering up the sexual abuse of an 11-year-old girl in the Australian branch of the church.&lt;ref name=ABC&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cannane|first1=Steve|title=Top Scientologist 'covered up sex abuse'|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/05/20/2904503.htm|date=May 20, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100523005340/http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/05/20/2904503.htm|archivedate=2010-05-23|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Scientologist Jan Eastgate accused of covering up abuse|url=http://www.news.com.au/national/scientologist-jan-eastgate-accused-of-covering-up-abuse/news-story/1d0abb875c4f71e2599a47f5e3d6f35a|date=May 20, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170219171854/http://www.news.com.au/national/scientologist-jan-eastgate-accused-of-covering-up-abuse/news-story/1d0abb875c4f71e2599a47f5e3d6f35a|archivedate=2017-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eastgate was head of the Australian CCHR at the time and the girl was abused by her Scientologist stepfather between the ages of 8 and 11 years. Eastgate, who denied the allegations, labelling them "egregiously false",&lt;ref name=ABC/&gt; was arrested on 30 March 2011 on charges of [[perverting the course of justice]] but later released on conditional bail.&lt;ref name=Eastgate_Arrest&gt;{{cite news |title=Senior scientologist arrested over lie claims |url= http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2011/s3231180.htm |date=30 May 2011 |accessdate=30 May 2011 |author=Steve Cannane |publisher=[[abc.net.au]] |work=[[Lateline]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010044605/http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/senior-scientologist-arrested-over-lie-claims/2738108 |archivedate=2017-10-10 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; All charges were dropped against Eastgate after an investigation by the New South Wales Director of Public Prosecution found that there was not enough substantiating evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=ALBERICI |first1=EMMA |title=Charges dropped against senior Scientologist |url=http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/charges-dropped-against-senior-scientologist/3970720 |website=LateLine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the immediate aftermath of the [[September 11 attacks]], CCHR promulgated a [[conspiracy theory]] assigning responsibility for the attacks to [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]], alleging that, as [[Osama bin Laden]]'s personal psychiatrist (although he is actually a surgeon), he was the principal mastermind behind the attacks and had brainwashed bin Laden using pain, drugs and hypnosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cchrstl.org/documents/terror.pdf|title=Chaos and Terror: Manufactured by Psychiatry|author=|date=|website=cchrstl.org|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Coco|first=Glen|title=Scientologists Really, Really hate Psychiatrists|url=https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/nn4mx7/scientologists-really-really-hate-psychiatrists||date=Jan 7, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010043907/https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/nn4mx7/scientologists-really-really-hate-psychiatrists|archivedate=2017-10-10|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Contemporary Religious Satanism: A Critical Anthology''''' is an academic anthology published by [[Ashgate Publishing|Ashgate]] in 2009 and edited by the Norwegian [[religious studies]] scholar Jesper Aa. Petersen. Containing eight separate papers produced by various scholars working in the field of Satanism studies, the book examines different forms of [[Satanism]] as practiced in Europe and North America. ''Contemporary Religious Satanism'' was a part of Ashgate's series of books on "Controversial New Religions" alongside tomes devoted to religious movements like [[Wicca]] and the [[Order of the Solar Temple]].

Edited by Petersen, then a lecturer at the [[Norwegian University of Science and Technology]], the book was divided into three sections.

Academic reviews were mixed, being printed in peer reviewed journals such as ''[[Nova Religio]]'', ''[[Aries (journal)|Aries]]'' and ''[[Magic, Ritual, and Witchcraft]]''. It was recognised as a pioneering publication in the field of Satanism studies.

==Reception==
The volume was reviewed by French anthropologist Jean La Fontaine for the ''[[Nova Religio]]'' journal.

Erik Davis of [[Rice University]] reviewed the anthology for the ''[[Magic, Ritual, and Witchcraft]]'' journal, noting that the book was primarily sociological in basis but that it opened up "an underresearched and underreported topic". Describing Petersen's "thorough introduction", he then discusses the various papers within the anthology. He opines that Lowney had "beautifully" described her encounters, but that it was "unfortunate" that she spent so much of the text reflecting on her logistical challenges, subsequently describing Søderlind and Dyrendal's contribution as "one of the most lively and entertaining" parts of the volume. He remarks positively of Granholm's criticism of the term "Satanism", describing his chapter as a "crucial contribution", and believing that he has made a "good case" for the term "Left Hand Path". Moving on to review the inclusion of primary documents at the end of the volume, he believes that the works presented appear "minor in context", and that it is unfortunate that texts from LaVey and Aquino were not included. As such, he believes that ''Contemporary Religious Satanism'' is not "the perfect reader." Wishing that philosophical and symbolic analyses of Satanism had been included alongside the sociological studies, he also felt that "much more can be made" regarding the differences between LaVeyan-influenced secular Satanists and the mystical Left-Hand Path followers. He believed that the volume would be of great interest to scholars of magic, contemporary Paganism and new religious movements.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dav11|Davis 2011]].&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Counterfeit God'''" is a [[single (music)|single]] by [[Black Label Society]], featured on their 2000 [[studio album]] ''[[Stronger Than Death]]''.

==Background==
The song is about [[televangelist]]s, much like the earlier [[Ozzy Osbourne]] song which Zakk co-wrote, "[[Miracle Man (Ozzy Osbourne song)|Miracle Man]]", which dealt with the hypocrisy of [[Jimmy Swaggart]]. In a 2000 interview, Wylde (who is a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]]) said, "I saw a TV evangelist. This guy sells out arenas, and he touches people on the head, and they're supposed to be blind, and then they're not blind anymore. That's the biggest backstabbing version of God I've ever...[[Anton LaVey]]'s got nothing over this guy. That's pure [[Satanism]] to me. He's backstabbing God so bad it's not even funny. People are paying money for that, and believe in that. How the hell are they believing it? This guy's playing God. To me, it's pure [[blasphemy]]."

==Music video==
The [[music video]] features actor [[Mark Wahlberg]] as a stand-in for the band's bassist, because they did not have one at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtv.com/news/1431836/wahlbergs-dragon-megadeth-more-to-play-la/ Wahlberg's "Dragon," Megadeth, More To Play L.A.]&lt;/ref&gt; It also includes Rick Phillips, a teacher at [[Valencia High School (Santa Clarita, California)|Valencia High School]]. [[Steve Gibb]] appears as the character painted as a skeleton and carrying chains; not long after this Gibb joined as bassist.

==Popular culture==
"Counterfeit God" is the entrance theme of [[Martin Stone (wrestler)|Martin Stone]], a British [[professional wrestling|wrestler]] currently under the RQW [[professional wrestling promotion|promotion]].

[[File:Dendera Temple.jpg|thumb|right|General view of Dendera Temple complex]]
[[File:Dendera 7 977.PNG|thumb|right|Temple of Hathor, Dendera]]

'''Dendera Temple complex''' ([[Demotic Egyptian|Ancient Egyptian]]: ''Iunet'' or ''Tantere''; the 19th-century English spelling in most sources, including [[Giovanni Battista Belzoni|Belzoni]], was '''Tentyra''') is located about {{convert|2.5|km}} south-east of [[Dendera]], [[Egypt]]. It is one of the best-preserved [[Egyptian temple|temple]] complexes in Egypt. The area was used as the sixth [[Nome (Egypt)|Nome]] of [[Upper Egypt]], south of [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]].

==Description==
[[File:Mudbrick compound walls.JPG|thumb|250px|right|The massive mudbrick compound walls seen from the temple roof.]]The whole complex covers some 40,000 square meters and is surrounded by a hefty mud brick enclosed wall. Dendera was a site for chapels or shrines from the beginning of history of ancient Egypt. It seems that pharaoh [[Pepi I]] (ca. 2250 BC) built on this site and evidence exists of a temple in the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|eighteenth dynasty]] (ca 1500 BC). However, the earliest extant building in the compound today is the [[Mammisi]] raised by [[Nectanebo II]] – last of the native [[pharaoh]]s (360–343 BC). The features in the complex include: 
* Hathor temple (the main temple)
* Temple of the birth of Isis
* Sacred Lake
* Sanatorium
* Mammisi of Nectanebo II
* Christian Basilica
* Roman Mammisi
* a Barque shrine
* Gateways of [[Domitian]] and [[Trajan]]
* the Roman Kiosk

==Hathor temple==

The all overshadowing building in the Complex is the main temple, namely '''Hathor temple''' (historically called the '''Temple of Tentyra''').  The temple has been modified on the same site starting as far back as the [[History of Ancient Egypt#Middle Kingdom|Middle Kingdom]], and continuing right up until the time of the Roman emperor [[Trajan]].&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Ann Kipfer, "''[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0306461587&amp;id=XneTstDbcC0C Encyclopedic Dictionary of Archaeology]''".  Page 153&lt;/ref&gt; The existing structure was built no later than the late [[Ptolemaic Egypt|Ptolemaic period]]. The temple, dedicated to [[Hathor]], is one of the best preserved temples in all Egypt. Subsequent additions were added in Roman times.

Layout elements of the temple:
* Large [[Hypostyle Hall]]
* Small Hypostyle Hall
* Laboratory
* Storage magazine
* Offering entry
* [[Treasury]]
* Exit to well
* Access to stairwell
* [[Offering hall]]
* Hall of the [[Ennead]]
* Great Seat and main sanctuary
* Shrine of the Nome of Dendera
* Shrine of [[Isis]]
* Shrine of [[Seker|Sokar]]
* Shrine of [[Harsomtus]]
* Shrine of Hathor's [[Sistrum]]
* Shrine of gods of [[Lower Egypt]]
* Shrine of [[Hathor]]
* Shrine of the throne of Rê
* Shrine of [[Rê]]
* Shrine of [[Menat]] collar
* Shrine of [[Ihy]]
* [[The Pure Place]]
* Court of the First Feast
* Passage
* Staircase to roof

Depictions of [[Cleopatra VI]] which appear on temple walls are good examples of Ptolemaic Egyptian art.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Pentland Mahaffy]], "''[https://books.google.com/books?vid=0j3YkB6wR7Fox7erT7pYM7j&amp;id=HiANAAAAIAAJ A History of Egypt Under the Ptolemaic Dynasty]''". Methuen &amp; Co., 1899. 261 pages. Page 237 and 248.&lt;/ref&gt; On the rear of the temple exterior is a carving of Cleopatra VII Philopator (the popularly well known [[Cleopatra]]) and her son, Ptolemy XV Philopator Philometor Caesar ([[Caesarion]]), fathered by [[Julius Caesar]].&lt;ref&gt;Mahaffy, Page 251.&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Dendera zodiac===
[[File:Dendera.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Denderah zodiac]]
{{Main|Dendera zodiac}}
The sculptured ''Dendera zodiac'' (or ''Denderah zodiac'') is a widely known relief found in a late Greco-Roman temple, containing images of [[Taurus (astrology)|Taurus]] (the [[bull]]) and the [[Libra (astrology)|Libra]] (the [[Weighing scale#Balance|balance]]). A sketch was made of it during the [[French Invasion of Egypt (1798)|Napoleonic campaign in Egypt]]. In 1820 it was removed from the temple ceiling by French colonizers and replaced with a fake. There is controversy as to whether they were granted permission by Egypt's ruler, Muhammad Ali Pasha, to do so, or whether they stole it. The real one is now in the Louvre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.history.com/news/egypts-most-wanted-an-antiquities-wish-list|title=Egypt’s Most Wanted: An Antiquities Wish List|work=HISTORY.com|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Champollion]]'s guess that it was Ptolemaic proved to be correct, and Egyptologists now date it to the first century BC.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lhl.lib.mo.us/events_exhib/exhibit/exhibits/napoleon/zodiac_dendera.shtml Napoleon and the Scientific Expedition to Egypt&lt;/ref&gt;

===Necropolis and crypts===

The '''Dendera necropolis''' is a series of [[mastaba]] [[tomb]]s. The [[necropolis]] dates from the [[Early Dynastic Period of Egypt|Early Dynastic Period]] of the [[Old Kingdom]] to the [[First Intermediate Period of Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Ann Kipfer, "''[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0306461587&amp;id=XneTstDbcC0C Encyclopedic Dictionary of Archaeology]''".&lt;/ref&gt; The necropolis runs the eastern edge of the western hill and over the northern plain. The subterranean ''Hathor temple tombs'' total 12 chambers. Some reliefs are dated to as late as the Ptolemy XII Neos Dionysos reign. The [[crypt]]s reportedly were used for storing vessels and divine iconography. An opening in the "Flame Room" floor leads to a narrow chamber with representations on the walls of the objects which were kept in them. In the second chamber, a relief depicts Pepi I. He offers a statuette of the god [[Ihy]] to four images of Hathor. In the crypt, reached from the "throne room", [[Ptolemy XII]] has jewelry and offerings for the gods.

===The Dendera light===
{{main|Dendera light}}
[[File:Dendera light 002.jpg|250px|thumb|Dendera light, showing the single representation on the left wall of the right wing in one of the crypts]]
Hathor Temple has a relief sometimes known as the [[Dendera light]] because of a controversial fringe thesis about its nature. The ''Dendera light'' images comprise five stone reliefs (two of which contain a pair of what fringe authors refer to as lights) in the Hathor temple at the Dendera Temple complex located in [[Egypt]]. The view of [[Egyptologist]]s is that the relief is a [[Egyptian mythology|mythological]] depiction of a [[djed]] pillar and a [[Nymphaea caerulea|lotus]] flower, spawning a snake within, representing aspects of [[Egyptian mythology]].&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Waitkus, ''Die Texte in den unteren Krypten des Hathortempels von Dendera: ihre Aussagen zur Funktion und Bedeutung dieser Räume'', Mainz 1997 {{ISBN|3-8053-2322-0}} (tr., ''The texts in the lower crypts of the Hathor tempels of Dendera: their statements for the function and meaning of these areas'')
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"''[http://users.iafrica.com/g/gr/grenvill/denderah.htm Dendera Temple Crypt]''". iafrica.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to this interpretation, there is a [[fringe science]] suggestion that it is actually a representation of an Ancient Egyptian lightbulb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U0MoAQAAIAAJ&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwieheW7nubUAhWGEVAKHaUQDHM4ChDoAQgwMAM |title=Max Planck Forschung |year=2000 |page=72 |chapter=Fantastereien |first=Helmut |last=Hornung |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ceiling cleaning===

[[File:Ceiling of Temple of Hathor.JPG|thumb|Recently cleaned ceiling of the Temple of Hathor]]
The ceiling of the Hathor Temple has recently been cleaned in a careful way that removed hundreds of years of black soot without harming the ancient paint underneath. Spectacular ceiling painting has been exposed in the main hall, and some of the most vibrant and colourful paintings dating from antiquity are now visible.

==Tourism==
The Dendera complex has long been one of the most tourist-accessible ancient Egyptian places of worship. It used to be possible to visit virtually every part of the complex, from the crypts to the roof. However, the highest part of the roof of Hathor temple has been closed since 2003. The second stage of the roof was closed in November 2004, after a tourist got too close to the edge and fell to her death on the bedrock below.

'''Edward Greenly''' (3 December 1861 – 4 March 1951) was an English geologist known for his a detailed geological survey of the island of [[Anglesey]]. ''The Geology of Anglesey'' was published in two volumes in 1919 and followed by a one-inch geological map in 1920.&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;E. N. K. Clarkson, [http://www.oxforddnb.com.gate.lib.buffalo.edu/view/article/37485 "Greenly, Edward (1861–1951)"] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' (Oxford University Press 2004); online edn, Jan 2011 [http://www.oxforddnb.com.gate.lib.buffalo.edu/view/article/37485, accessed 26 April 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

Edward Greenly was born in [[Bristol]], the only child of a doctor, Charles Hickes Greenly, and his wife, the former Harriet Dowling. He attended [[Clifton College]],&lt;ref&gt;"Clifton College Register" Muirhead, J.A.O. p72: Bristol; J.W Arrowsmith for Old Cliftonian Society; April, 1948&lt;/ref&gt; then [[University College London]], where he studied [[petrology]] with [[Thomas George Bonney]] and received his [[Doctor of Science|D.Sc.]]&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stein 1980"&gt;[[Gordon Stein|Stein, Gordon]]. (1980). ''An Anthology of Atheism and Rationalism''. Prometheus Books. p. 185. {{ISBN|978-0879752569}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greenly left school and joined the Geological Survey in 1889, and spent the next six years surveying the northwest [[Scottish Highlands]]. He resigned the Survey in 1895. Soon, he began an independent survey of Anglesey which took him until 1910 to complete, and nine more years to get the results published. During the survey, he named [[mélange]], the geological phenomenon previously described as crush [[breccia]].&lt;ref&gt;A. M. C. Şengör, [https://books.google.com/books?id=eYHEEWhye94C&amp;lpg=PA409&amp;dq=Edward%20Greenly&amp;pg=PA410 "Repeated Rediscovery of Mélanges and its Implications"] in Yildrim Dilek and Sally Newcomb, eds., ''Ophiolite Concept and the Evolution of Geological Thought'' (Geological Society of America 2003): 409–410. {{ISBN|9780813723730}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two-volume product of his years of work, ''The Geology of Anglesey'', was published in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Greenly, [https://archive.org/details/geologyofanglese01greeuoft ''The Geology of Anglesey''] (Memoirs of the Geological Society: London 1919).&lt;/ref&gt; The accompanying map was published the following year, delayed by [[World War I]].&lt;ref name="Treagus"&gt;Jack Treagus, [https://www.geolsoc.org.uk/Geoscientist/Archive/April-2010/Greenlys-geological-map-of-Anglesey "Greenly's Geological Map of Anglesey"] ''Geoscientist Online'' 20(4)(April 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the Anglesey work, Greenly co-authored a text on surveying (''Methods of Geological Surveying'', 1930),&lt;ref&gt;Edward Greenly and Howel Williams, [https://books.google.com/books?id=-STQAAAAMAAJ ''Methods of Geological Surveying''] (Thomas Murby 1930).&lt;/ref&gt; and an autobiography, ''A Hand Through Time: Memories Romantic'' (1938).&lt;ref&gt;[http://angleseynature.co.uk/Greenly.html "Edward Greenly (1861–1951)"]. Anglesey Nature.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

Greenly met [[Ann Greenly|Ann Bernard]] (1852–1927) when he was very young, in 1875. They married in 1891. Annie studied geology informally, and was a contributor to Edward's work as an assistant and editor. She created the massive index to the Anglesey survey. (Her handwritten draft, with papers strung on thread, is now in the [[National Museum of Wales]].)&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;T. P. T. Williams, [https://books.google.com/books?id=9Pc-KlQ3I54C&amp;lpg=PA319&amp;dq=Anglesey%20woman&amp;pg=PA319#v=onepage "The Role of Annie Greenly in the Elucidation of the Geology of Anglesey"] in Cynthia V. Burek and Bettie Higgs, ''The Role of Women in the History of Geology'' (Geological Society of London 2007): 319–324. {{ISBN|9781862392274}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Anglesey survey, the Greenlys lived in [[Bangor, Gwynedd|Bangor]], and worked together on a small textbook, ''The Earth'', right before Annie's death in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Greenly, [https://books.google.com/books?id=FGimXwAACAAJ ''The Earth, Its Nature and History''] (Watts 1927).&lt;/ref&gt; Edward died in 1951, age 90. His remains are with his wife's, in a churchyard at [[Llangristiolus]].&lt;ref name="Williams" /&gt;

Greenly endowed the Annie Greenly Fund with the Geological Society, to support mapping projects.&lt;ref name="Treagus" /&gt;

[[Bangor University]] holds a small collection of papers and letters belonging to Greenly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archiveswales.org.uk/anw/get_collection.php?inst_id=39&amp;coll_id=10076&amp;expand= Edward Greenly, Bangor Papers], Bangor University.&lt;/ref&gt;

He contributed several articles to the [[Rationalist Press Association]] Annual.&lt;ref name="Stein 1980"/&gt;

==Christ myth theory==

Greenly was an advocate of the [[Christ myth theory]].&lt;ref name="Stein 1980"/&gt; He was the author of the booklet ''The Historical Reality of Jesus: A Concise Statement of the Problem'' (1927). It contains a summary of the arguments supporting the non-historicity of Jesus found in the works of [[J. M. Robertson]], [[Arthur Drews]], [[Thomas Whittaker (metaphysician)|Thomas Whittaker]], and [[Paul-Louis Couchoud]].

The booklet was reprinted in [[Gordon Stein]]'s ''An Anthology of Atheism and Rationalism'' in 1980. Stein considered it the "best short summary that exists of the vastly complex problem of determining whether Jesus, called Christ, was a historical human being or only a concretion of earlier myths given human form."&lt;ref name="Stein 1980"/&gt;

'''Erich Kahn''' (1904–1979) was a German [[Expressionist]], and a survivor of the [[Nazism|Nazi]] persecution of [[Jews]] and [[Romani people|Gypsies]] during the events that led to [[World War II]].

==Biography==
He was born and lived in [[Germany]] until, persecuted by Nazis, he found himself imprisoned at the [[Welzheim]] concentration camp. After taking refuge in [[England]], he was interned for a while at [[Hutchinson Internment Camp|Hutchinson Camp]], on the [[Isle of Man]]. He died in [[London]], at the age of 75.&lt;ref&gt;[https://dn.sapo.pt/2005/05/07/boa_vida/gritos_guerra_e_morte_traco_erich_ka.html Gritos de guerra e morte no traço de Erich Kahn] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061129055944/http://dn.sapo.pt/2005/05/07/boa_vida/gritos_guerra_e_morte_traco_erich_ka.html |date=2006-11-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
Much of Kahn's work has been lost. The main reason being he belonged to what came to be known as the "Forgotten Generation" of German Jewish Expressionism-influenced artists born at the beginning of the 20th century, whose careers were hindered by the ascension of Nazism. Forced into exile to survive, they found themselves forever bereft of their identity, "caught between yesterday and tomorrow".

The [[Berardo Collection]] has acquired a large part of Erich Kahn's body of work, which testifies to the richness of a life that even surpasses the biography ''[[A Painter's Life and Time]]'', written by [[Klaus E. Hinrichsen]], an art historian who was his friend for many years.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1135">'''Esteban Rojas Tovar''' was a [[Colombia]]n educator, philanthropist and, from 1900-1922, bishop of the diocese of [[Garzón (Colombia)|Garzón]] in the department of [[Huila Department|Huila]] in Colombia.

After studying philosophy and theology he was ordained as a priest and rose rapidly through the Colombian ecclesiastical hierarchy.  This was due in a large part to his organisational and leadership skills. As a priest he was well known for pastoral and missionary work, his integrity and his austere lifestyle.  He founded many colleges in Huila and [[Tolima Department|Tolima]] as well as the Council Seminary of Garzón and the Mesa de Elías Seminary. Bishop Rojas Tovar worked tirelessly and most of the public works that benefited the department of Huila were carried out thanks to his intervention.&lt;ref&gt;El Huila, Academia de Historia Huilense, 1998 Vega, S.

The '''''Five Towns Jewish Times''''' is a weekly newspaper serving the Jewish communities of the [[Five Towns]] in southwestern [[Nassau County, New York|Nassau County]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and the greater New York area, covering the area's large and growing [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://5tjt.com/about-us/|title=The Five Towns Jewish Times - About us|accessdate=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The paper grew out of publisher Larry Gordon's response to an effort in 2000 by the Lawrence municipality to limit the establishment and growth of local Orthodox [[synagogue]]s. Gordon wrote a series of articles for the local ''[[Nassau Herald]]'', which resulted in an abrupt policy reversal.  Believing the Orthodox community needed its own media, Gordon established the ''5 Towns Jewish Times''.  Originally published twice a month, it is now published 50 times a year.

The paper is distributed every Thursday on newsstands and in synagogues and [[Jewish community center]]s. It is distributed for free on [[Long Island]] and sold for $1.00 in [[New York City]] and to weekly subscribers. The current print run each week is 20,000 papers.

In the [[Church of Scientology]], the Official Scientology and Dianetics glossary defines [[L. Ron Hubbard]]'s concept of "game" as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
game: a contest of person against person or team against team. A game consists of freedoms, barriers and purposes, and there is a necessity in a game to have an opponent or an enemy. Also there is a necessity to have problems, and enough individuality to cope with a situation. To live life fully, then, one must have in addition to "something to do," a higher purpose, and this purpose, to be a purpose at all, must have counter-purposes or purposes which prevent it from occurring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scientology.org/wis/wiseng/gloss.htm#g |title=Glossary for Scientology and Dianetics |publisher=The Church of Scientology |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080116024312/http://www.scientology.org/WIS/WISENG/gloss.htm |archivedate=January 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''[[The Aberree]]'' noted in its Volume 3, issue 1 (April 1956): "Scientology is Hubbard's game......It is also anyone's game who really wants to own and play it."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aberree.com/v03/n01p12.html Volume 3, Issue 1, page 12 | The Compleat Aberree&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientologist and jazz musician [[Chick Corea]] refers to Hubbard's "game" concept in his song "What Games Shall We Play Today?"{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

Compare the Scientological view of [[personal life|life]] as "a game. A game in which everyone can win and no one need lose."&lt;ref&gt;

'''Growth of religion''' is the spread of [[religion]]s and the increase of religious adherents around the world. The statistics are commonly measured by the absolute number of adherents, the percentage of the absolute growth per year, and the growth of the number of [[Religious conversion|converts]] in the world. Projections of future religious adherence are based on assumptions that trends, total fertility rates, life expectancy, political climate, conversion rates, secularization, etc will continue. Such forecasts cannot be validated empirically and are contentious, but are useful for comparison.&lt;ref name="Wiley-Blackwell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mjohnson"/&gt;

Studies in the 21st century show that, in terms of percentage and worldwide spread, [[Islam]] is the fastest-growing religion in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Islam Is the Fastest Growing Religion in the World|url=http://learningenglish.voanews.com/content/islam-fastest-growing-religion/2733147.html|accessdate=7 May 2016|publisher=[[Voice of America]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The List: The World's Fastest-Growing Religions|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2007/05/14/the-list-the-worlds-fastest-growing-religions/|publisher=www.foreignpolicy.com|accessdate=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Islam is world's fastest-growing religion, will equal Christianity by 2050|url=http://www.christiantoday.com/article/islam.is.worlds.fastest.growing.religion.will.equal.christianity.by.2050/51321.htm|publisher=[[Christian Today]]|accessdate=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fact-tank" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fast-growing Islam winning converts in Western world|url=http://edition.cnn.com/WORLD/9704/14/egypt.islam/|accessdate=7 July 2015|publisher=[[CNN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=time /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Religion in no danger of disappearing|url=http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/arts-and-life/life/faith/religion-in-no-danger-of-disappearing-308609271.html|publisher=[[Winnipeg Free Press]]|accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Islam Will Be Fastest-Growing Major Religion in Coming Decades: Report|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/religion/islam-fastest-growing-major-religion-coming-decades-report-n334986|publisher=[[NBCNews.com]]|accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PewIslam2011"/&gt; A religious forecast for 2050 by Pew Research Center concludes that global Muslim population is expected to grow at a faster rate than the non-Muslim population due primarily to the young age and high [[fertility rate]] of Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pewforum.org/files/2015/03/PF_15.04.02_ProjectionsFullReport.pdf The Future of World Religions p.70] This significant projected growth is largely due to the young age and high fertility rate of Muslims.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2015/12/25/460797744/a-religious-forecast-for-2050-atheism-is-down-islam-is-rising|title=A Religious Forecast For 2050: Atheism Is Down, Islam Is Rising|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Religious conversion]] has little impact on Muslim population, since the number of people who [[Convert to Islam|convert to]] or [[Apostasy in Islam|leave Islam]] are roughly equal.&lt;ref name="fact-tank"&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Muslims are the world's fastest-growing religious group|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/04/23/why-muslims-are-the-worlds-fastest-growing-religious-group/|publisher=www.pewresearch.org|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="www.pewforum.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Future of the Global Muslim Population|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2011/01/27/the-future-of-the-global-muslim-population/|publisher=www.pewforum.org|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="www.pewforum.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=cyzvLvtW-NoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Revelation+Hoofbeats&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj2nsmH37bLAhUDz3IKHXz3ASMQ6AEIHTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Revelation%20Hoofbeats&amp;f=false] p.153&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SAzizViY30EC|title=The World's Religions in Figures: An Introduction to International Religious Demography|first1=Todd M.|last1=Johnson|first2=Brian J.|last2=Grim|date=25 March 2013|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|via=Google Books|isbn=9781118323038}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Johnson and Grim, [[Buddhism]] has grown from a total of 138 million adherents in 1910, of which 137&amp;nbsp;million were in Asia, to 495&amp;nbsp;million in 2010, of which 487&amp;nbsp;million are in Asia.&lt;ref name="Johnson&amp;Grim2013"/&gt; According to them, there was a fast annual growth of Buddhism in [[Pakistan]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Lebanon]] and several Western European countries (1910–2010). More recently (2000–2010), the countries with highest growth rates are Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and some African countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johnson |first1=Todd M. |last2=Grim |first2=Brian J. |title=The World's Religions in Figures: An Introduction to International Religious Demography |url=http://media.johnwiley.com.au/product_data/excerpt/47/04706745/0470674547-196.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927183925/http://media.johnwiley.com.au/product_data/excerpt/47/04706745/0470674547-196.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=27 September 2013 |accessdate=2 September 2013 |year=2013 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |location=Hoboken, NJ |pages=34–36 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]], through statistical analysis, held [[Buddhism]] to be the fastest-growing spiritual tradition in Australia in terms of percentage gain, with a growth of 79.1% for the period 1996 to 2001 (200,000→358,000).&lt;ref name="abs.gov.au"/&gt;

And according to a 2012 Pew Research Center survey, over the next four decades the number of [[Buddhism by country|Buddhists around the world]] is expected to decrease from 487 million in 2010 to 486&amp;nbsp;million in 2050.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pewforum.org/files/2015/03/PF_15.04.02_ProjectionsFullReport.pdf Buddhists] p.104&lt;/ref&gt; The decline is due to several factors such as the low fertility level among Buddhists (1.6 children per woman),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pewforum.org/files/2015/03/PF_15.04.02_ProjectionsFullReport.pdf Buddhists] p.107&lt;/ref&gt; and the old age (median age of 34), compare to the overall population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pewforum.org/files/2015/03/PF_15.04.02_ProjectionsFullReport.pdf Buddhists] p.109&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a survey of [[religion in China]] in the year 2010, the number of people practicing some form of [[Chinese folk religion]] is near to 950 million (70% of the Chinese),&lt;ref name="CSLS2010"&gt;2010 Chinese Spiritual Life Survey conducted by Dr. Yang Fenggang, Purdue

This growth reverses the rapid decline that Chinese traditional religion faced in the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Johnson, Grim. 2013. p. 31"&gt;Johnson, Grim. 2013. p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Chinese religion has also spread throughout the world following the [[Chinese emigration|emigration of Chinese populations]], with 672,000 adherents in Canada as of 2010.&lt;ref name="Johnson, Grim. 2013. p. 31"/&gt;

According to scholars, the rebirth of Chinese traditional religion in China is faster and larger than the spread of other religions in the country, such as [[Buddhism]] and Christianity:&lt;ref&gt;Ruokanen, Huang. 2011. p. 171&lt;/ref&gt;

The American Religious Identification Survey gives [[Wicca]] an average annual growth of 143% for the period 1990 to 2001 (from 8,000 to 134,000 – ''U.S. data'' / similar for Canada &amp; Australia).&lt;ref name="cuny1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cuny2"/&gt; According to The Statesman Anne Elizabeth Wynn claims "The two most recent American Religious Identification Surveys declare Wicca, one form of paganism, as the fastest growing spiritual identification in America".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.statesman.com/life/faith/our-year-long-exploration-of-religions-ends-with-2069331.html|title=Our year-long exploration of religions ends with Unitarianian Universalism and paganism|last=(Elizabeth) Wynn|first=Anne|publisher=The Statesman.com|accessdate=2 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wicca: What's the Fascination?|url=https://www.cbn.com/entertainment/books/ElliottB_Wicca.aspx|publisher=[[Christian Broadcasting Network]]|accessdate=16 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mary Jones claims Wicca is one of the fastest-growing religions in the United States as well.&lt;ref name="PRLog"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.prlog.org/10144283-wicca-the-fastest-growing-belief-system-in-the-world-today.html|title=PRLog (Press Release) "Wicca"- The Fastest Growing Belief System in the World Today!|publisher=PRLog|accessdate=2 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wicca, which is largely a "Pagan" religion primarily attracts followers of nature-based religions in, as an example, the Southeast Valley region of the Phoenix, Arizona metropolitan area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azcentral.com/community/gilbert/articles/2010/10/22/20101022southeast-valley-paganism-on-rise.html|title=Rise in paganism in Southeast Valley mirrors U.S. trend|last=Puffer|first=Nancy|publisher=azcentral.com|accessdate=2 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nonreligious===
{{further|Irreligion by country}}{{see also|Demographics of atheism}}

In terms of absolute numbers, [[irreligion]] appears to be increasing (along with [[secularization]] generally).&lt;ref name="aris"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://commons.trincoll.edu/aris/publications/american-nones-the-profile-of-the-no-religion-population/|title=American Nones: The Profile of the No Religion Population|year=2008|publisher=American Religious Identification Survey|accessdate=19 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See the [[Demographics of atheism#Geographic distribution|geographic distribution of atheism]].)

According to [[Pew Research Center]] survey in 2012 [[Irreligion|religiously unaffiliated]] (include agnostic and [[atheist]]) make up about 18.2% of Europeans population.&lt;ref name="Religiously Unaffiliated"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/global-religious-landscape-unaffiliated.aspx|title=Religiously Unaffiliated|date=18 December 2012|work=Pew Research Center's Religion &amp; Public Life Project|accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American Religious Identification Survey gave nonreligious groups the largest gain in terms of absolute numbers: 14.3 million (8.4% of the population) to 29.4 million (14.1% of the population) for the period 1990–2001 in the U.S.&lt;ref name="cuny1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cuny2"&gt;[http://www.gc.cuny.edu/CUNY_GC/media/CUNY-Graduate-Center/PDF/ARIS/ARIS-PDF-version.pdf?ext=.pdf American Religious Identification Survey, Full PDF Document] The Graduate Center of the City University of New York&lt;/ref&gt; A 2012 study by the [[Pew Research Center|Pew Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life]] reports, "The number of Americans who do not identify with any religion continues to grow at a rapid pace. One-fifth of the U.S. public – and a third of adults under 30 – are religiously unaffiliated today, the highest percentages ever in Pew Research Center polling."&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/Unaffiliated/nones-on-the-rise.aspx|title='No Religion' on the Rise: One-in-Five Adults Have No Religious Affiliation|date=9 October 2012|publisher=[[Pew Research Center|Pew Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life]]|accessdate=19 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar pattern has been found in other countries such as Australia, Canada, and Mexico. According to statistics in Canada, the number of "Nones" increased by about 60% between 1985 and 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who's religious? by Warren Clark and Grant Schellenberg|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/11-008-x/2006001/9181-eng.htm#decline|publisher=www.statcan.gc.ca|accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia, census data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics give "no religion" the largest gains in absolute numbers over the 15 years from 1991 to 2006, from 2,948,888 (18.2% of the population that answered the question) to 3,706,555 (21.0% of the population that answered the question).&lt;ref name="censusdata.abs.gov.au"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.censusdata.abs.gov.au/ABSNavigation/prenav/ViewData?action=404&amp;documentproductno=0&amp;documenttype=Details&amp;order=1&amp;tabname=Details&amp;areacode=0&amp;issue=2006&amp;producttype=Census%20Tables&amp;javascript=true&amp;textversion=false&amp;navmapdisplayed=true&amp;breadcrumb=POTLD&amp;&amp;c|title=Redirect to Census data page|first=c=AU; o=Commonwealth of Australia; ou=Australian Bureau of|last=Statistics|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[INEGI]], in Mexico, the number of atheists grows annually by 5.2%, while the number of Catholics grows by 1.7%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aciprensa.com/noticia.php?n=20574Aciprensa|title=México sigue siendo católico… pero crece el número de ateos|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/new.php?n=12159|title=Mexico still Catholic, but number of atheists on the rise|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[New Zealand]], 39% of the population are irreligious making it largest percentage of total population in Oceania region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2012/eap/208254.htm|publisher=U.S. Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor |title=International Religious Freedom Report 2012&amp;nbsp;– New Zealand |accessdate=28 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a religious forecast for 2050 by Pew Research Center the percentage of the world's population that unaffiliated or Nonreligious is expected to drop, from 16% of the world's total population in 2010 to 13% in 2050.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/files/2015/03/PF_15.04.02_ProjectionsFullReport.pdf|title=Unaffiliated p:81|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decline is largely due to the advanced age (median age of 34) and low fertility among unaffiliated or Nonreligious (1.7 children per woman in the 2010–2015 period). Sociologist [[Phil Zuckerman]]'s global studies on atheism have indicated that global atheism may be in decline due to irreligious countries having the lowest birth rates in the world and religious countries having higher birth rates in general.&lt;ref name=zucker&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zuckerman|first1=Phil|editor1-last=Martin|editor1-first=Michael|title=The Cambridge Companion to Atheism|date=2007|publisher=Cambridge Univ. Press|isbn=978-0521603676|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2050 unaffiliated or Nonreligious was expected to account 27% of North America total population (up from 17.1% as in 2010), and 23% of Europe total population (up from 18% as in 2010) according to [[Pew Research Center|Pew Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life]].&lt;ref name="p.82"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/files/2015/03/PF_15.04.02_ProjectionsFullReport.pdf|title=p.82|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The religiously unaffiliated are stationed largely in the Asia-Pacific region, where 76% resided in 2010, and is expected to be 68% by 2050. The share of the global unaffiliated population living in Europe is projected to grow from 12% in 2010 to 13% in 2050. The proportion of the global religiously unaffiliated living in North America, will rise from 5% in 2010, to 9% in 2050.&lt;ref name="p.82"/&gt;

== Overall statistics ==
=== Data collection ===
Statistics on religious adherence are difficult to gather and often contradictory; statistics for the change of religious adherence are even more so, requiring multiple surveys separated by many years using the same data gathering rules. This has only been achieved in rare cases, and then only for particular countries, such as the [[American Religious Identification Survey]]&lt;ref name="cuny1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gc.cuny.edu/Faculty/GC-Faculty-Activities/ARIS--American-Religious-Identification-Survey/Key-findings |title=American Religious Identification Survey, Key Findings |website=The Graduate Center of the City University of New York |date=October 2001 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414233611/http://www.gc.cuny.edu/Faculty/GC-Faculty-Activities/ARIS--American-Religious-Identification-Survey/Key-findings |archive-date=14 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the United States, or census data from Australia (which has included a voluntary religious question since 1911).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Future growth ===

In [[demonology]], '''Haagenti''' is a Great President of [[Hell]], ruling thirty-three legions of [[demon]]s. He makes men wise by instructing them in every subject, transmutes all metals into [[gold]], and changes wine into water and water into wine.

Haagenti is depicted as a big bull with the wings of a [[griffin]], changing into a man under request of the [[Evocation|conjurer]].

As pure hashish will not burn if rolled alone in a joint, it is typically mixed with herbal cannabis, [[tobacco]] or another type of herb for this method of consumption.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}
Depending on region or country, multiple synonyms and alternative names exist.&lt;ref name="drugsCom"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hashish|url=https://www.drugs.com/illicit/hashish.html|website=drugs.com|accessdate=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hash is an extracted cannabis product composed of compressed or purified preparations of stalked resin glands, called [[trichome]]s, from the plant. It is defined by the 1961 UN Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs (Schedule I and IV) as "the separated resin, whether crude or purified, obtained from the cannabis plant". The resin contains ingredients such as [[tetrahydrocannabinol]] (THC) and other [[cannabinoid]]s—but often in higher concentrations than the unsifted or unprocessed cannabis flower.&lt;ref&gt;Russo, Ethan.  ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=qH-2Lj9x7L4C&amp;pg=PT34 Cannabis and Cannabinoids: Pharmacology, Toxicology, and Therapeutic Potential]'', p. 34 (Routledge 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Purities of confiscated hashish in Europe (2011) range between 4-15%. Between 2000 and 2005 the percentage of hashish in cannabis end product seizures was at 18%.&lt;ref name="EMCDDA08" /&gt;

Hashish may be solid or resinous depending on both preparation and room temperature; pressed hashish is usually solid, whereas water-purified hashish—often called "bubble melt hash", or simply "bubble hash"—is often a paste-like substance with varying hardness and pliability; its color, most commonly light to dark brown, can vary from transparent to yellow, tan, black, or red. This all depends on the process and amount of leftover plant material (i.e. chlorophyl) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.druglibrary.org/medicalmj/hash/guide_to_the_different_types_of_.htm Guide To The Different Types Of Hash From Around The World]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hashish was the primary form of cannabis used in Europe in 2008. Herbal cannabis is more widely used in Northern America.&lt;ref name="EMCDDA08" /&gt;

Besides its recreational use, the active ingredient of hashish, [[THC]], has been of interest for research and medical purposes since its arrival in the 18th century. While it was widely used as a medicine for multiple diseases, the emergence of specific treatments led to a sharp decline in prescriptions, eventually becoming illegal to use via the 1971 UN Convention on Psychotropic Substances.&lt;ref name="EMCDDA08" /&gt;

The street price for hashish in Europe in 2011 varied from €3 (Portugal) per gram to €18 in Malta, or even as high as 200NOK (€20/$25) in Norway.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

== History ==
Hashish has been consumed for many centuries, though there is no clear evidence as to its first appearance.&lt;ref name=ConnelClarke&gt;Hashish! by Robert Connell Clarke, {{ISBN|0-929349-05-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; North [[India]] has a long social tradition in the production of hashish, known locally as ''[[charas]]'', which is believed to be the same plant resin as was burned in the ceremonial ''booz rooz'' of [[Ancient Persia]].&lt;ref&gt;Usaybia, Abu; ''Notes on Uyunu al-Anba fi Tabaquat al-Atibba'', Berkeley: University of California Press, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first attestation of the term "hashish" is in a pamphlet published in Cairo in 1123 CE, accusing [[Nizari]] Muslims of being "hashish-eaters".&lt;ref name="Booth2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin Booth|title=Cannabis: A History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mjn6sCiHoFIC&amp;pg=PA84|date=30 September 2011|publisher=Transworld|isbn=978-1-4090-8489-1|pages=84–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 13th century [[Ibn Taymiyyah]] prohibited the use of hashish; he mentioned that it was introduced to Levant with the Mongol invasion (throughout the 13th century).&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Taymiyyah, Majmu al-Fatwa al-Kubra(Arabic), Vol. 3, p 425. http://shamela.ws/browse.php/book-9690#page-1323&lt;/ref&gt; Smoking did not become common in the Old World until after the introduction of tobacco, so up until the 1500s hashish in the Muslim world was consumed as an edible.&lt;ref name="Chasteen2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Charles Chasteen|title=Getting High: Marijuana through the Ages|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pk-xCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA72|date=9 February 2016|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-1-4422-5470-1|pages=72–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1596, Dutchman [[Jan Huyghen van Linschoten]] spent three pages on "Bangue" (''[[bhang]]'') in his historic work documenting his journeys in the East. He particularly mentioned the Egyptian hashish.&lt;ref name="linschoten"&gt;{{cite book |year=1885 |pages=115–117 |author1=Burnell, Arthur Coke  |author2=Tiele, P.A |url=https://archive.org/details/voyagejohnhuygh02tielgoog |title=The voyage of John Huyghen van Linschoten to the East Indies |series=from the old English translation of 1598: the first book, containing his description of the East |place=London |publisher=The [[Hakluyt Society]]}}  Full text at Internet Archive.  [https://archive.org/stream/voyagejohnhuygh02tielgoog#page/n135/mode/2up Chapter on Bangue].&lt;/ref&gt;  He said, "Bangue is likewise much used in Turkie and Egypt, and is made in three sorts, having also three names. The first by the Egyptians is called Assis (Hashish (Arab.)), which is the poulder of Hemp, or of Hemp leaves, which is water made in paste or dough, they would eat five peeces, (each) as big as a Chestnut (or larger); This is used by the common people, because it is of a small price, and it is no wonder, that such vertue proceedeth from the Hempe, for that according to Galens opinion, Hempe excessively filleth the head."

Hashish arrived in Europe from the East during the 18th century,&lt;ref name="EMCDDA08" /&gt; and is first mentioned scientifically by [[Johann Friedrich Gmelin|Gmelin]] in 1777.&lt;ref name="EMCDDA08" /&gt; The Napoleonic campaigns introduced French troops to hashish in Egypt and the first description of usefulness stems from 1830 by pharmacist and botanist [[Theodor Friedrich Ludwig Nees von Esenbeck]].&lt;ref name="EMCDDA08" /&gt; In 1811, the founder of [[homoeopathy]], [[Samuel Hahnemann]], published a "proving" of the effects of Cannabis Sativa in his work ''Reine Arzneimittellehre'' (Materia Medica Pura).&lt;ref&gt;https://hpathy.com/e-books/materia-medica-pura-samuel-hahnemann/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1839, [[William Brooke O'Shaughnessy|O’Shaughnessy]] wrote a comprehensive study of Indian hemp, which was recognised by the European school of medicine and describes hashish as relief for cramps and causing the disappearance of certain symptoms from afflictions such as rabies, cholera, and tetanus.&lt;ref name="EMCDDA08" /&gt; This led to high hopes in the medical community. In 1840 [[Louis Aubert-Roche]] reported his successful use of hashish against pestilence.&lt;ref name="EMCDDA08" /&gt;  Also psychiatric experiments with hashish were done at the same time with [[Jacques-Joseph Moreau]] being convinced that it is the supreme medicament for use in psychiatry.&lt;ref name="EMCDDA08" /&gt;

In the 19th century, hashish was embraced in some European literary circles. Most famously, the [[Club des Hashischins]] was a [[Paris]]ian club dedicated to the consumption of hashish and other drugs; its members included literary luminaries such as [[Théophile Gautier]], [[Jacques-Joseph Moreau|Dr. Moreau de Tours]], [[Victor Hugo]], [[Alexandre Dumas]], [[Charles Baudelaire]] and [[Honoré de Balzac]].&lt;ref name="levin"&gt;Levinthal, C. F. (2012). ''Drugs, behavior, and modern society''. (6th ed.). Boston: Pearson College Div.&lt;/ref&gt; Baudelaire later wrote the 1860 book ''[[Les paradis artificiels]]'', about the state of being under the influence of opium and hashish. At around the same time, American author [[Fitz Hugh Ludlow]] wrote the 1857 book ''[[The Hasheesh Eater]]'' about his youthful experiences, both positive and negative, with the drug.

Hashish was also mentioned and used as an anesthetic in Germany in 1869. At these times, hashish was imported in great quantities especially from India and called charas. However, there were also people who did not deem cannabis as harmless.&lt;ref name="EMCDDA08" /&gt; Between 1880 and 1900 was the peak of the medicinal use, where hashish compounds were most commonplace in almost all European countries and the USA. Evidence of misuse at that time was practically non-existent (as opposed to widespread reports in Asia and Africa).&lt;ref name="EMCDDA08"/&gt; Hashish played a significant role in the treatment of pain, migraine, dysmenorrhea, pertussis asthma and insomnia in Europe and USA towards the end of the 19th century. Rare applications included stomach ache, depression, diarrhea, diminished appetite, pruritus, hemorrhage, [[Basedow syndrome]] and malaria.&lt;ref name="EMCDDA08"/&gt; The usage of hashish decreased as even supporters agreed on the unreliability of its compounds, with critics calling it worthless and dangerous. Eventually, hashish as a medicine disappeared completely in the 20th century with the introduction of specific medicines for all of its main applications.&lt;ref name="EMCDDA08"/&gt; The use was later prohibited worldwide as the use as a medicine was made impossible by the 1961 UN [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]].

At the beginning of the 20th century, the majority of hashish in Europe came from Kashmir, Afghanistan, and parts of India, as well as Greece, Syria, Nepal, Lebanon, and Turkey. Larger markets developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s when most of the hashish was imported from Pakistan and Afghanistan. Due to disruptive conflicts in the regions, Morocco took over and was the sufficient exporter until lately.{{when|date=December 2017}}&lt;ref name="ChouvyBackground"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chouvy|first1=Pierre-Arnaud|title=The supply of hashish to Europe|journal=Background paper commissioned by the EMCDDA for the 2016 EU Drug Markets Report|url=http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/system/files/publications/2373/downloads/EDRM2016%20Background%20paper_CHOUVY_The%20Supply%20of%20Hashish%20to%20Europe.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that massive hashish production for international trade originated in [[Morocco]] during the 1960s, where the cannabis plant was widely available. Before the coming of the first hippies from the ''Hippie Hashish Trail'', only small pieces of Lebanese hashish were found in Morocco.&lt;ref name="ConnelClarke"/&gt;

However, since the 2000s there has been a dramatic shift in the market due to an increase of homegrown cannabis production. While Morocco held a quasi-monopoly in the 1990s with the so-called 250g "soap bar" blocks, which were of low quality, Afghanistan has now been announced the biggest producer of higher quality hashish. Since then, the quality in Europe has increased while the prices have remained stable.&lt;ref name="EMCDDA08" /&gt;

==European market==
According to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA), Western Europe is the biggest market for cannabis resin with 70% of global seizures. The European hashish market is changing though: Cannabis cultivation increased throughout the 1990s until 2004, with a noticeable decrease reported in 2005 according to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction.&lt;ref name="EMCDDA08" /&gt;
Morocco has been the major source, however lately there has been a shift in the market and Afghanistan has been named the major producer of Hashish. Even though a drop in usage and production has been reported, Morocco produced around 6600 tonnes of resin in 2005.&lt;ref name="EMCDDA08" /&gt;

As 641 tonnes of hashish were consumed in the EU in 2013, the European market is currently the world’s largest and most profitable. Therefore, many actors are involved in the business, including organised crime groups. The largest cannabis resin seizures in Europe happen in Spain, due to its proximity to Northern Africa.&lt;ref name="EMCDDA08" /&gt;

The 1990s "soap bars" disappeared and the physical shapes of hashish changed to melon shaped, tablets or olive shaped pellets. Overall the general trend of domestically grown cannabis displacing the imported resin leads to a market reaction of potency changes while the prices remain stable while soap-bar potency increased from 8% to up to 20.7% in 2014.&lt;ref name="EMCDDA08" /&gt;

Generally, more resin than herb is consumed in Europe.&lt;ref name="EMCDDA08" /&gt;

==Substance properties==
As hashish is a derivative of [[cannabis]], it has the same substance properties. When smoked, [[THC]] can be detected in plasma within seconds, with a half-life of 2 hours. Due to its lipophilic nature, it is widely distributed through the body, and some metabolites can be detected in urine for up to two weeks following consumption.&lt;ref name=EMCDDAProfile&gt;{{cite web|title=Cannabis drug profile|url=http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/publications/drug-profiles/cannabis|website=emcdda.europa.eu|accessdate=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hashish is made from [[cannabinoid]]-rich glandular hairs known as [[trichomes]], as well as varying amounts of cannabis flower and leaf fragments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gloss|first1=D|title=An Overview of Products and Bias in Research|journal=Neurotherapeutics|date=October 2015|volume=12|issue=4|pages=731–4|doi=10.1007/s13311-015-0370-x|pmid=26202343|pmc=4604179|type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flowers of a mature female plant contain the most trichomes, though trichomes are also found on other parts of the plant. Certain strains of cannabis are [[cannabis (drug) cultivation|cultivated]] specifically for their ability to produce large amounts of trichomes. The resin reservoirs of the trichomes, sometimes erroneously called [[pollen]] (vendors often use the euphemism "pollen catchers" to describe [[sieve|screened]] [[kief]]-grinders in order to skirt paraphernalia-selling laws), are separated from the plant through various methods.

==Application==
===Set and setting===
Hashish is often consumed in a social setting, being smoked by multiple people who share a pipe, [[bong]], [[joint (cannabis)|joint]] or [[Vaporizer_(inhalation_device)|vaporizer]].

===After effects===
The pharmacology of hashish is complicated because of the wide range of [[cannabinoids]]. There is little evidence for damage to the organ system, only due to the consumption in combination with tobacco.&lt;ref name = Tashkin13&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tashkin| first1 = DP | year = 2013 | title = Effects of marijuana smoking on the lung.| journal = Annals of the American Thoracic Society | volume = 10| issue = 3| pages = 239–247| doi= 10.1513/AnnalsATS.201212-127FR | pmid=23802821}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has also been an association with schizophrenia, however it is unclear if there is a causative relationship.&lt;ref name="EMCDDAProfile" /&gt;

Generally the after effects are the same as for cannabis use in general, including its [[effects of cannabis|long term effects]].&lt;ref name = CreanCrane&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Crean| first1 = R.D.| last2 = Crane| first2 = N.A.| year = 2011| title = An evidence based review of acute and long-term effects of cannabis use on executive cognitive functions.| journal = Journal of Addiction Medicine | volume = 5| issue = 1| pages = 1–8| doi= 10.1097/ADM.0b013e31820c23fa| pmc = 3037578 | pmid=21321675}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use==
[[File:Sebse.jpg|thumb|[[Sebsi]], a Moroccan long-drawtube one-hitter.]]
Hashish can be consumed by oral ingestion or smoking; typically in a pipe, [[bong]], [[vaporizer (cannabis)|vaporizer]] or [[joint (cannabis)|joints]], where it is normally mixed with [[cannabis]] or [[tobacco]], as pure hashish will burn poorly if burned alone. In some parts of Canada, individuals do what is known as "bottle tokes", in which they take a lit cigarette, stick a "bot"(small hashish ball) then let the smoke fill the bottle before inhalation. [[THC]] has a low water solubility therefore ingestion leads to poor absorption.&lt;ref name= EMCDDAProfile/&gt; Generally the methods are similar to overall [[cannabis consumption]].

==Altered state==
As hashish’ active ingredient is [[THC]] it has the same effects as [[cannabis]]. Most well known effect of hashish is a euphoric, drowsy, sedated effect. A certain relief of anxiety is often reported.&lt;ref name = JohnsA2001&gt;{{cite journal |first1 = Andrew| last1 = Johns| year = 2001| title =  Psychiatric effects of cannabis | url = http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/bjprcpsych/178/2/116.full.pdf | journal = British Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 178| issue = 2 | pages = 116–122 | doi= 10.1192/bjp.178.2.116}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a high, the user experiences a distortion of time and space.&lt;ref name="Tart"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tart|first1=Charles T.|title=Altered States of Consciousness|date=1972|publisher=Doubleday|isbn=978 0385067287|url=http://druglibrary.org/schaffer/hemp/general/mjeff1.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been claimed that the user’s psychological and physiological needs will influence the response and that the user must cooperate with and facilitate the effects. Therefore, the effect of the physical and interpersonal setting is strong and usually controls the underlying tone of the experience.&lt;ref name="Tart" /&gt; Generally the intensification of sensation and increased clarity of perception have been reported.&lt;ref name="Tart" /&gt; Short lived adverse effects have also been reported, including psychotic states following heavy consumption.&lt;ref name = Khan09&gt;{{cite journal |first1 = Masood A| last1 = Khan|first2 = Sailaja| last2=Akella | year = 2009| title =  Cannabis-Induced Bipolar Disorder with Psychotic Features | journal = Psychiatry (Edgmont) | volume = 6| issue = 12 | pages = 44–48| pmc= 2811144 | pmid=20104292}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regular users are at risk of dependence. Especially people with major mental illnesses e.g. schizophrenia are vulnerable as hashish provokes relapse and aggravates existing symptoms.&lt;ref name="JohnsA2001" /&gt;

===Perceptual changes===
As perceptual changes are very hard to measure, most studies on the altered state of consciousness concentrate on subjective descriptions only.
The general awareness of proprioceptive responses seem to enhance, as emotional involvement is reported to enhance perception in general. Taste and smell seem intensified and visual scenes seem to have more depth while sounds are heard with more dimension.&lt;ref name = Tart/&gt; Perception of time is also reported to change: there is a general experience of time distortion where events take longer to occur and the subject is involved in internal fantasies with the impression that external time has slowed down.&lt;ref name = Tart/&gt; However, there seems to be no impression of speed or rapidity for internal processes. Similar effects are common in normal experience, for example when time slows down in boredom. It is proposed that this distortion is caused as the experience itself is the focus of attention rather than what is happening around the individual.&lt;ref name = Tart/&gt;

Functional associations seem to decrease in strength and there are fewer mental impositions on the sensory perception of the object. Aspects which are normally filtered out are given equal attention. Therefore, objects are not necessarily conceptualized via their use but rather experienced as a whole.&lt;ref name = Tart/&gt; Detailed attention is paid, focussing on certain aspects of an object, a sentence or any other perceptual input in a magnifying way. Clearly the attention process is affected. Only a narrow amount of diverse content is the focus of attention and fewer objects are perceived.&lt;ref name = Tart/&gt; A person may become absorbed by one object, event or process up to the exclusion of everything else, which has been called a train of fantasy and has been described as a form of tunnel vision where the individual is more aware of an individual element of meaning, emotion etc. There seems to be a certain unity of attention while normally attention relies on multiple channels.&lt;ref name = Tart/&gt; Flights of fantasy and dreaming, including perceiving connections and associations of ideas that do not seem accessible in a normal state are often reported.&lt;ref name = Tart/&gt;

There seems to be a reduction of the automatic availability of memory images, however an increased strength of memories when relevant to central needs.&lt;ref name = Tart/&gt; Experiences seem new and are experienced without a feeling of familiarity and is more intense if emotionally salient. This emotional force may activate internal imagery, which is used to search for identity or to interpret incoming stimuli.&lt;ref name = Tart/&gt; Short term memory becomes shorter and in a very high state the sequence of thoughts is not remembered past one or two transitions.&lt;ref name = Tart/&gt;

Expectancies and anticipation which are important to keep behaviour consistent in normal states seem to be decreased in strength which might lead to surprising or out-of-character behaviour.&lt;ref name = Tart/&gt; Normally these expectancies let the person behave in a goal directed and reasonable manner, with the decrease the person might act out in illogical and unforeseeable ways. Similarly inhibitions, especially social inhibition seems to be reduced, resulting in playful behaviour and acting on impulses.&lt;ref name = Tart/&gt;

== Manufacturing processes ==
{{anchor|Honey oil}}
[[File:Récolte de la résine de cannabis, Uttarakhand, Inde 288x512.ogv|thumb|upright|Making charas from fresh ''cannabis'' resin, [[Uttarakhand]], India]]
The sticky resins of the fresh flowering female cannabis plant are collected by pressing or rubbing the flowering plant between two hands and then forming the sticky resins into a small ball of hashish called charas.

Mechanical separation methods use physical action to remove the trichomes from the dried plant material, such as sieving through a screen by hand or in motorized tumblers.  This technique is known as "drysifting". The resulting powder, referred to as "kief" or "drysift", is compressed with the aid of heat into blocks of hashish; if pure, the kief will become gooey and pliable. When a high level of pure THC is present, the end product will be almost transparent and will start to melt at the point of human contact.

[[Ice-water separation]] is another mechanical method of isolating trichomes. Newer techniques have been developed such as heat and pressure separations, static-electricity sieving or acoustical dry sieving.&lt;ref&gt;Skunk Pharma Search, ''[http://skunkpharmresearch.com/acoustical-dry-sieving/ Acoustical dry sieving]''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:American medical hashish(3).jpg|thumb|180px|right|[[Trichome]]s isolated with ice-water extraction method.]]

Trichomes may break away from supporting stalks and leaves when plant material becomes brittle at low temperatures. After plant material has been agitated in an icy slush, separated trichomes are often dense enough to sink to the bottom of the ice-water mixture following agitation, while lighter pieces of leaves and stems tend to float.&lt;ref name="cc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cannabisculture.com/v2/content/how-make-wicked-hash|title=How to Make Wicked hash/Bubble hash|last=Scammel and|first=Liza|author2=Bianca Sind|publisher=Cannabis Culture Magazine|accessdate=22 June 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628043115/http://www.cannabisculture.com/v2/content/how-make-wicked-hash|archivedate=28 June 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ice-water method requires ice, water, agitation, filtration bags with various-sized screens and plant material. With the ice-water extraction method the resin becomes hard and brittle and can easily be separated. This allows large quantities of pure resins to be extracted in a very clean process without the use of solvents, making for a more purified hashish.&lt;ref name="cc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cc2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cannabisculture.com/articles/2789.html|title=Bubble Hash|last=Brady|first=P.|date=February 4, 2003|publisher=Cannabis Culture Magazine|accessdate=22 June 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612235138/http://www.cannabisculture.com/articles/2789.html|archivedate=12 June 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chemical separation methods generally use a [[solvent]] such as [[ethanol]], [[butane]] or [[hexane]] to dissolve the [[lipophilicity|lipophilic]] desirable resin. Remaining plant materials are filtered out of the solution and sent to the compost. The solvent is then evaporated, or boiled off (purged) leaving behind the desirable resins, called honey oil, "[[hash oil]]", or just "oil". Honey oil still contains [[wax]]es and [[essential oil]]s and can be further purified by [[vacuum distillation]] to yield "red oil". The product of chemical separations is more commonly referred to as "honey oil." This oil is not really hashish, as the latter name covers trichomes that are extracted by sieving. This leaves most of the glands intact.

In a study conducted in 2014 by Jean-Jaques Filippi, Marie Marchini, Céline Charvoz, Laurence Dujourdy and Nicolas Baldovini (''Multidimensional analysis of cannabis volatile constituents: Identification of 5,5-dimethyl-1-vinylbicyclo[2.1.1]hexane as a volatile marker of hashish, the resin of Cannabis sativa L.'') the researchers linked the characteristic flavour of hashish with a rearrangement of [[myrcene]] caused during the process of manufacture.&lt;ref&gt;Alchimia Blog, ''[https://www.alchimiaweb.com/blogen/hashishene-the-terpene-of-hashish/ Hashishene, the new terpene of cannabis]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the production process, the product can be contaminated with different amount of dirt and plant fragments, vary greatly in terms of appearance, texture, odour and potency. Also, adulterants may be added in order to increase weight or modify appearance.&lt;ref name="ChouvyBackground" /&gt;

Morocco has been the major hashish producer globally with €10.8 billion earned with Moroccan resin in 2004.&lt;ref name="EMCDDA08" /&gt; However, Chouvy (2016) suggests that some of the so- called "Moroccan" actually stems from local European production.&lt;ref name="ChouvyBackground" /&gt; The income for the farmers lay around €325 million in 2005. While the overall amount of plants and areas shrank in size, the introduction of more potent hybrid plant produced a high resin rate.The range or resin produced is estimated between 3800 and 9500 tonnes in 2005.&lt;ref name="EMCDDA08" /&gt;

The largest producer today is Afghanistan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=122108&amp;sectionid=351020403 |title=UN: Afghanistan world leading hashish producer |publisher=PressTV |date=March 31, 2010 |accessdate=February 1, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530055538/http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=122108&amp;sectionid=351020403 |archivedate=May 30, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2010/03/31/afghanistan-leading-hashish-producer/ | work=Fox News | title=UN: Afghanistan is leading hashish producer | date=2010-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; however studies suggest there is a "hashish revival" in Morocco.&lt;ref name=ChouvyAfsahi&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chouvy| first1 =Pierre Arnaud| last2= Afsahi| first2 = Kenza| year = 2014 | title = Hashish Revival in Morocco | url = http://geopium.org/?p=655 | journal = International Journal of Drug Policy | volume = 25| issue = 3| pages = 416–423  |ISSN = 0955-3959 | doi=10.1016/j.drugpo.2014.01.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Quality ==
Tiny pieces of leaf matter may be accidentally or even purposely added; [[adulterant]]s introduced when the hashish is being produced will reduce the purity of the material and often resulting in green finished product. The [[tetrahydrocannabinol]] (THC) content of hashish comes in wide ranges from almost none to 65% and that of [[hash oil]] from 30% to 90%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Inciardi |first=James A. |title=The War on Drugs II |year=1992 |publisher=Mayfield Publishing Company |location=[[Mountain View, California|Mountain View]], [[California|CA]] |isbn=1-55934-016-9 |page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As mentioned above, there has been a general increase in potency as the competition has grown bigger and new hybrid plants have been developed.&lt;ref name="ChouvyBackground" /&gt;

== Synonyms ==

Street names often refer to the shape in which the hash is formed, such as a candy bar, soap bar, nine bar, finger, patties, or surfboard.

'''Hindu denominations''' are traditions within  [[Hinduism]] centered on one or more gods or goddesses, such as [[Shiva]], [[Vishnu]] and [[Brahma]].&lt;ref name=lancenelson/&gt; Sometimes the term is used for ''sampradayas'' led by a particular [[guru]] with a particular philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Julius J. Lipner]] (2009), Hindus: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices, 2nd Edition, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0-415-45677-7}}, pages 377, 398&lt;/ref&gt;

Hinduism has no central doctrinal authority and many practising Hindus do not claim to belong to any particular denomination or tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Werner|1994|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four major traditions are, however, used in scholarly studies: ''Vaishnavism'', ''Shaivism'', ''Shaktism'' and ''Smartism''.&lt;ref name=lancenelson&gt;Lance Nelson (2007), An Introductory Dictionary of Theology and Religious Studies (Editors: Orlando O. Espín, James B. Nickoloff), Liturgical Press, {{ISBN|978-0814658567}}, pages 562–563&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Flood|1996|p=113, 134, 155–161, 167–168}}{{sfn|Nath|2001|p=31}} These are sometimes referred to as the denominations of Hinduism, and they differ in the primary deity at the center of the tradition.&lt;ref name=sskumar&gt;SS Kumar (2010), Bhakti – the Yoga of Love, LIT Verlag Münster, {{ISBN|978-3643501301}}, pages 35–36&lt;/ref&gt; A notable feature of Hindu denominations is that they do not deny other concepts of the divine or deity, and often celebrate the other as henotheistic equivalent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=George Lundskow |title=The Sociology of Religion: A Substantive and Transdisciplinary Approach |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5AV1AwAAQBAJ |year=2008|publisher=SAGE Publications |isbn=978-1-4522-4518-8 |pages=252–253}}&lt;/ref&gt; The denominations of Hinduism, states Lipner, are unlike those found in major religions of the world, because Hindu denominations are fuzzy with individuals practicing more than one, and he suggests the term "Hindu polycentrism".&lt;ref name="Julius J 2009 pages 37–375"&gt;[[Julius J. Lipner]] (2009), Hindus: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices, 2nd Edition, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0-415-45677-7}}, pages 371–375&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Hinduism contains many denominations and philosophies, it is linked by shared concepts, recognisable rituals, [[Hindu cosmology|cosmology]], [[Hindu texts|shared textual resources]], [[Hindu pilgrimage sites|pilgrimage to sacred sites]] and the [[Hinduism#Questioning authority|questioning of authority]].&lt;ref name=frazierintrop2&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frazier|first1=Jessica|title=The Continuum companion to Hindu studies | date=2011|publisher=Continuum|location=London|isbn=978-0-8264-9966-0|pages=1–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Typology==
Hindus subscribe to a diversity of ideas on [[Spirituality#Hinduism|spirituality]] and traditions, but have no ecclesiastical order, no unquestionable religious authorities, no governing body, no prophet(s) nor any binding holy book; Hindus can choose to be polytheistic, pantheistic, monotheistic, monistic, agnostic, atheistic or humanist.&lt;ref&gt;[[Julius J. Lipner]] (2009), Hindus: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices, 2nd Edition, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0-415-45677-7}}, page 8; Quote: "(...) one need not be religious in the minimal sense described to be accepted as a Hindu by Hindus, or describe oneself perfectly validly as Hindu. One may be polytheistic or monotheistic, monistic or pantheistic, even an agnostic, humanist or atheist, and still be considered a Hindu."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lester Kurtz (Ed.), Encyclopedia of Violence, Peace and Conflict, {{ISBN|978-0123695031}}, Academic Press, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MK Gandhi, [http://www.mkgandhi.org/ebks/essence_of_hinduism.pdf The Essence of Hinduism], Editor: VB Kher, Navajivan Publishing, see page 3; According to Gandhi, "a man may not believe in God and still call himself a Hindu."&lt;/ref&gt;

Hinduism as it is commonly known can be subdivided into a number of major currents. Of the historical division into six [[darsanas]] (philosophies), two schools, [[Vedanta]] and [[Yoga (philosophy)|Yoga]], are currently the most prominent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Development and Religion: Theology and Practice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DIvHQc0-rwgC |author=Matthew Clarke|publisher=Edward Elgar |year=2011|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Classified by primary deity or deities, four major Hinduism modern currents are [[Vaishnavism]] (Vishnu), [[Shaivism]] (Shiva), [[Shaktism]] (Devi) and [[Smarta Tradition|Smartism]] (five deities treated as same).{{sfn|Nath|2001|p=31}}{{sfn|Flood|1996|pp=113, 154}} These deity-centered denominations feature a synthesis of various [[Hindu philosophy|philosophies]] such as Samkhya, Yoga and Vedanta, as well as shared spiritual concepts such as [[moksha]], [[dharma]], [[karma]], [[samsara]], ethical precepts such as [[ahimsa]], texts ([[Upanishad]]s, [[Puranas]], [[Mahabharata]], Agamas), ritual grammar and rites of passage.&lt;ref name=frazierintrop2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Julius J. Lipner (2010), Hindus: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices, 2nd Edition, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0-415-45677-7}}, pages 17–18, 81–82, 183–201, 206–215, 330–331, 371–375&lt;/ref&gt;

===McDaniel – six generic "types"===
McDaniel (2007) distinguishes six generic "types" of Hinduism, in an attempt to accommodate a variety of views on a rather complex subject:&lt;ref&gt;J. McDaniel ''Hinduism'', in John Corrigan, ''The Oxford Handbook of Religion and Emotion'', (2007) Oxford University Press, 544 pages, pp. 52–53 {{ISBN|0-19-517021-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Folk Hinduism]], based on local traditions and cults of local [[deities]] and extending back to prehistoric times, or at least prior to written [[Vedas]].
* [[Shrauta]] or "Vedic" Hinduism as practised by traditionalist [[brahmin]]s ([[Shrauta|Shrautin]]s).
* [[Vedanta|Vedantic]] Hinduism, including [[Advaita Vedanta]] ([[Smartism]]), based on the philosophical approach of the [[Upanishads]].
* [[Yoga|Yogic]] Hinduism, especially the sect based on the [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]].
* [[Dharma|"Dharmic"]] Hinduism or "daily morality", based on [[Karma]] and upon societal norms such as [[Vivāha]] (Hindu marriage customs).
* [[Bhakti]] or devotionalist practices

===Sampradaya===
{{Main|Sampradaya}}

In [[Hinduism]], a ''sampradaya'' ([[IAST]] ''{{IAST|sampradāya}}'') is a denomination.&lt;ref&gt;[[Julius J. Lipner]] (2009), Hindus: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices, 2nd Edition, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0-415-45677-7}}, page 398&lt;/ref&gt; These are teaching traditions with autonomous practices and monastic centers, with a [[guru]] lineage, with ideas developed and transmitted, redefined and reviewed by each successive generation of followers.&lt;ref&gt;Julius J. Lipner (2009), Hindus: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices, 2nd Edition, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0-415-45677-7}}, pages 375–377, 397–398&lt;/ref&gt; A particular [[guru]] lineage is called ''[[parampara]]''. By receiving [[Diksha|diksha (initiation)]] into the ''parampara'' of a living guru, one belongs to its proper ''sampradaya''.

==Main denominations==
===Vaishnavism===
[[File:Krishna, Kottangal padayani.JPG|thumb|Vaishnavism focuses on an avatar of Vishnu, such as Krishna above]]
{{main|Vaishnavism}}

[[Vaishnavism]] is a devotional sect of Hinduism, which worships the god [[Vishnu]] as the Supreme Lord ([[Svayam Bhagavan]]). As well as Vishnu himself, followers of the sect also worship Vishnu's ten incarnations (the [[Dashavatara]]). The two most-worshipped incarnations of Vishnu are Krishna and Rama, whose stories are told in the [[Mahabharata]] and the [[Ramayana]] respectively. The adherents of this sect are generally non-ascetic, monastic and devoted to meditative practice and ecstatic chanting.&lt;ref name="Dubois"/&gt; Vaishnavites are deeply devotional. Their religion is rich in saints, temples and scriptures.&lt;ref name="Himalaya Academy"&gt;{{cite web|title=HimalayanAcademy|url=http://www.himalayanacademy.com/readlearn/basics/four-sects|accessdate=7 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vaishnava ''sampradayas'' include:{{refn|group=note|Quoted in [[Otto von Böhtlingk|Böhtlingk]]'s [[Sanskrit]]-Sanskrit [[dictionary]], entry ''Sampradaya''.{{sfn|Apte|1965}}}}
* [[Ramanandi Sampradaya]], also known as the Ramayat Sampradaya or the Ramavat Sampradaya adheres to the teachings of the Advaita scholar [[Ramananda]]. This is the largest monastic group within Hinduism and in Asia, and these Vaishnava monks are known as ''Ramanandis'', ''Vairagis'' or ''Bairagis''.&lt;ref&gt;Selva Raj and William Harman (2007), Dealing with Deities: The Ritual Vow in South Asia, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791467084}}, pages 165–166&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James G Lochtefeld (2002), The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism: N–Z, Rosen Publishing, {{ISBN|978-0823931804}}, pages 553–554&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ramdas Lamb (2008), Theory and Practice of Yoga (Editor: Knut A Jacobsen), Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120832329}}, pages 317–330&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Vishistadvaita]] includes Udhava Sampradaya to which also the Swaminarayan Sampradaya belongs. They adhere to the teachings of Vishistadvaita scholar [[Ramanuja]].
* [[Srivaishnavism]] (Sri-Vaishnava Sampradaya)/[[Srivaishnava]]/[[Sri Sampradaya]]/[[Iyengar]] is associated with [[Lakshmi]]. The principal [[acharya]]s are [[Ramanujacharya]] and [[Vedanta Desikan]].
* [[Swaminarayan Hinduism]] or ''Swaminarayanism'', based on the teachings of [[Swaminarayan]].
* [[Brahma Sampradaya]] is associated with [[Vishnu]], who is the Para-Brahma (Universal Creator), not to be confused with the [[Brahma]] deity. The founder of this sampradaya was the Dvaita Vedanta philosopher [[Madhvacharya]].
* [[Gaudiya Vaishnavism]] is associated with Brahma Sampradaya, and is associated with [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]](Gaurangacharya). The [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness]] belongs to this sampradaya.
* [[Krishnaism]] or ''Bhagavatism''.
* [[Rudra Sampradaya]]. The principal acharya is [[Vallabhacharya]].
* [[Kumara Sampradaya]] is the tradition associated with [[Four Kumaras]]. The principal acharya is [[Nimbarka]], hence [[Nimbarka Sampradaya]].

Other Vaishnava schools and the principal [[Acharya|teachers]] connected with them are:{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}
* [[Manavala Mamunigal]]'s sect is the oldest Vaishnava sect in India. This sampraday was followed by [[Vyasa]], [[Parasara]], [[Bodhayana]]. The lineage of Acharya is [[Lord Narayana]], next Lakshmi and then Vishweksenar, Nammalwar, Nathamuni, Uyyakondar, Manakal Nambi, Alavandar, [[Periya Nambi]], [[Ramanujacharya]] and finally [[Vedanta Desikan]] as per the Vadagalai sampradaya.

===Shaivism ===
{{main|Shaivism}}
[[File:Bearded Shiva.jpg|thumb|Shaivism focuses on Shiva.]]
Shaivas or Shaivites are those who primarily worship [[Shiva]] as the supreme god, both [[immanence|immanent]] and [[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]]. Shaivism embraces at the same time [[monism]] (specifically [[nondualism]]) and [[Dualism (Indian philosophy)|dualism]]. To Shaivites, Shiva is both with and without form; he is the Supreme Dancer, [[Nataraja]]; and is [[linga]], without beginning or end. Shiva is sometimes depicted as the fierce god [[Bhairava]]. Saivists are more attracted to asceticism than adherents of other Hindu sects, and may be found wandering India with ashen faces performing self-purification rituals.&lt;ref name="Dubois"/&gt; They worship in the temple and practice yoga, striving to be one with Siva within.&lt;ref name="Himalaya Academy"/&gt;

The major schools of Śaivism include:
* [[Saiva Siddhanta]], adheres to the teachings of [[Tirumular]]/Sundaranatha ([[Nandinatha Sampradaya]], the monistic school) or of Meykandadeva ([[Meykandar Sampradaya]], the dualistic school).
* [[Adinath Sampradaya]] or Siddha Siddhanta, adheres to the teachings of [[Gorakhnath]] and [[Matsyendranath]].
* [[Shiva Advaita]], adheres to the teachings of Nilakantha (Srikantha) and [[Appayya Dikshitar]].
* [[Kashmir Shaivism]], adheres to the teachings of [[Vasugupta]] and his disciplinic lineage, including [[Abhinavagupta]].
* [[Pashupata Shaivism]], adheres to the teachings of [[Lakulisa]].

Other branches:
* [[Lingayatism]], or ''Veerashaivism'', ''Virashaivism'', is a distinct Shaivite tradition in India, established in the 12th century by the [[philosopher]] and social reformer [[Basavanna]]. It makes several departures from mainstream [[Hinduism]] and propounds [[monotheism]] through worship centered on Lord [[Shiva]] in the form of [[linga]] or ''Ishtalinga''. It also rejects the authority of the [[Veda]]s and the [[Caste system in India|caste system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Speaking of Śiva | series = UNESCO. Indian translation series.

Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 09 Jul. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Aaiyyanism'' is a religion claiming to be a form of pure Dravidian Hinduism and identifying as a Shaivite branch. It is incorporated in the Aaiyyan World Forum.

===Shaktism===
{{main|Shaktism}}
[[File:3 Shaktism goddesses Devi collage.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Shaktism is a Goddess-centric tradition of Hinduism. From left: [[Durga]], [[Kali]] and [[Saraswati]]]]
Shaktas worship goddess as Mother [[Shakti]], in different forms. These forms may include [[Kali]], [[Durga]], [[Laxmi]], and [[Saraswati]]. The branch of Hinduism that worships the goddess, known as Devi, is called [[Shaktism]]. Followers of Shaktism recognize [[Shakti]] as the power that underlies the male principle, and Devi is often depicted as Parvati the consort of Shiva or as Lakshmi the consort of Vishnu. She is also depicted in other guises, such as the fierce Kali or Durga. Shaktism is closely related with Tantric Hinduism, which teaches rituals and practices for purification of the mind and body.&lt;ref name="Dubois"/&gt;

Animal sacrifice of cockerels, goats and to a lesser extent water buffalos is practiced by Shakti devotees, mainly at temples of Goddesses such as Bhavani or Kali.&lt;ref name="Fuller Christopher John 2004 83"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fuller Christopher John|first=|title=The camphor flame: popular Hinduism and society in India|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/7823.html|edition=Revised and Expanded|year=2004|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-12048-5|page=83|chapter=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=J.

===Smartism===
[[File:Aum Om gold circle black.svg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|Aum]]
{{main|Smarta tradition}}
Smartas treat all deities as same, and their temples include five deities (Pancopasana) or [[Panchadevata]] as personal ''saguna'' (divine with form) manifestation of the ''nirguna'' (divine without form) Absolute, the [[Brahman]]. The choice of the nature of God is up to the individual worshiper since different manifestations of God are held to be equivalent. It is nonsectarian as it encourages the worship of any personal god along with others such as Ganesha, Shiva, Devi (Shakti), Vishnu, Surya.&lt;ref name="Dubois"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dubois|title=Hindu Manners, Customs and Ceremonies|publisher=Cosimo|page=111|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4zMY2qURR-8C&amp;pg=PA111&amp;dq=hindu+sects#v=onepage&amp;q=hindu%20sects&amp;f=false|isbn=9781602063365|date=2007-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Smarta Tradition accepts two concepts of Brahman, which are the ''[[saguna brahman]]'' – the Brahman with attributes, and ''[[nirguna brahman]]'' – the Brahman without attributes.&lt;ref name="dx.doi.org"&gt;Anantanand Rambachan (2001), [https://dx.doi.org/10.7825/2164-6279.1250 Heirarchies {{sic|hide=y}} in the Nature of God? Questioning The "Saguna-Nirguna" Distinction in Advaita Vedanta], ''Journal of Hindu–Christian Studies'', Vol. 14, No. 7, pages 1–6&lt;/ref&gt; The ''nirguna Brahman'' is the unchanging Reality, however, the ''saguna Brahman'' is posited as a means to realizing this ''nirguna Brahman''.&lt;ref name=williamw/&gt; The concept of the ''saguna Brahman'' is considered in this tradition to be a useful symbolism and means for those who are still on their spiritual journey, but the saguna concept is abandoned by the fully enlightened once he or she realizes the identity of their own soul with that of the ''nirguna Brahman''.&lt;ref name=williamw&gt;William Wainwright (2012), [http://stanford.library.usyd.edu.au/entries/concepts-god/ Concepts of God], ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', Stanford University&lt;/ref&gt; A Smarta may choose any ''saguna'' deity (''istadevata'') such as Vishnu, Shiva, Durga, Surya, Ganesha or any other, and this is viewed in Smarta Tradition as an interim step towards meditating on Om and true nature of supreme reality, thereby realizing the ''nirguna'' Brahman and its equivalence to one's own Atman, as in [[Advaita Vedanta]].{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|2013|pp=29–30}}

The movement is credited to [[Adi Shankara|Shankara]] (~8th century CE), who is regarded as the greatest teacher{{sfn|Doniger|1999|p=1017}}{{sfn|Popular Prakashan|2000|p=52}} and reformer of the Smartha.{{sfn|Rosen|2006|p=166}}{{sfn|Popular Prakashan|2000|p=52}} According to Hiltebeitel, Shankara established the nondualist interpretation of the Upanishads as the touchstone of a revived ''smarta'' tradition.{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|2013}} The [[Sringeri Sharada Peetham|Sringeri Sharada monastery]] founded by [[Adi Shankara]] Acharya in Karnataka is still the centre of the Smarta sect.{{sfn|Doniger|1999|p=1017}}{{sfn|Popular Prakashan|2000|p=52}}

===Overlap===
Halbfass states that, although traditions such as [[Shaivism]] and [[Vaishnavism]] may be regarded as "self-contained religious constellations",{{sfn|Halbfass|1991|p=15}} there is a degree of interaction and reference between the "theoreticians and literary representatives"{{sfn|Halbfass|1991|p=15}} of each tradition which indicates the presence of "a wider sense of identity, a sense of coherence in a shared context and of inclusion in a common framework and horizon".{{sfn|Halbfass|1991|p=15}} It is common to find Hindus revering Shiva, Vishnu and Shakti, and celebrating festivals related to them at different times of the year. Temples often feature more than one of them, and Hinduism is better understood as polycentric theosophy that leaves the choice of deity and ideas to the individual.&lt;ref name="Julius J 2009 pages 371–375"/&gt;

The key concepts and practises of the four major denominations of Hinduism can be compared as below:

==Other denominations==
===Shrautism===
{{main|Shrauta}}
Shrauta communities are very rare in India, the most well known being the ultra-orthodox [[Nambudiri]] Brahmins of [[Kerala]]. They follow the "Purva-Mimamsa" (earlier portion of Vedas) in contrast to Vedanta followed by other Brahmins. They place importance on the performance of Vedic Sacrifice ([[Yajna]]). The Nambudiri Brahmins are famous for their preservation of the ancient [[Soma (drink)|Soma]]yaagam, Agnicayana rituals which have vanished in other parts of India.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

===Suryaism / Saurism===
{{main|Saura (Hinduism)}}
The Suryaites or Sauras are followers of a Hindu denomination that started in Vedic tradition, and worship [[Surya]] as the main visible form of the [[Saguna Brahman]]. The Saura tradition was influential in South Asia, particularly in the west, north and other regions, with numerous Surya idols and temples built between 800 and 1000 CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=André Wink|title=Al-Hind, the Making of the Indo-Islamic World: Early Medieval India and the Expansion of Islam 7th–11th Centuries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g2m7_R5P2oAC |year=2002|publisher=BRILL|isbn=0-391-04173-8|pages=292–293}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Asha Kalia|title=Art of Osian Temples: Socio-economic and Religious Life in India, 8th-12th Centuries A.D.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3n-sycLo3XQC |year=1982|publisher=Abhinav Publications|isbn=978-0-391-02558-5|pages=1–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Konark Sun Temple]] was built in mid 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Finbarr Barry Flood|title=Objects of Translation: Material Culture and Medieval "Hindu-Muslim" Encounter|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OLNE_li8C10C |year=2009|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-12594-5|page=218}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the iconoclasm of Islamic invasions and Hindu–Muslim wars, the temples dedicated to Sun-god were among those desecrated, images smashed and the resident priests of Saura tradition were killed, states André Wink.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=André Wink|title=Al-Hind the Making of the Indo-Islamic World: The Slave Kings and the Islamic Conquest : 11th–13th Centuries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=75FlxDhZWpwC |year=1997|publisher=BRILL Academic|isbn=90-04-10236-1|pages=327–329}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Finbarr Barry Flood|title=Objects of Translation: Material Culture and Medieval "Hindu–Muslim" Encounter|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OLNE_li8C10C |year=2009|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-12594-5|pages=123–124, 154–156}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Surya tradition of Hinduism declined in the 12th and 13th century CE and today remains as a very small movement.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

===Ganapatism===
{{main|Ganapatya}}
Ganapatism is a Hindu denomination in which Lord [[Ganesha]] is worshipped as the main form of the [[Saguna Brahman]]. This sect was widespread and influential in the past and has remained important in [[Maharashtra]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

===Kaumaram===
{{main|Kaumaram}}
[[Kaumaram]] is a sect of Hindus, especially found in South India and Sri Lanka where Lord [[Muruga]] [[Karttikeya]] is the Supreme Godhead. Lord Muruga is considered superior to the Trimurti. The worshippers of Lord Muruga are called Kaumaras.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

===Indonesian Hinduism===
{{main|Hinduism in Southeast Asia|Hinduism in Indonesia|Balinese Hinduism}}

Hinduism flourished on the island of [[Java (island)|Java]] and [[Sumatra]] until the late 16th century, when a vast majority of the population converted by will or force to [[Islam]]. Only the [[Balinese people]] who formed a majority on the island of [[Bali]], retained this form of Hinduism over the centuries. Theologically, Balinese or Indonesian Hinduism is closer to Shaivism than to other major sects of Hinduism. The adherents consider  [[Acintya]] the supreme god, and all other gods as his manifestations.

The term "[[Agama Hindu Dharma]]", the endonymous [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] name for "Indonesian Hinduism" can also refer to the traditional practices in [[Kalimantan]], [[Sumatra]], [[Sulawesi]] and other places in Indonesia, where people have started to identify and accept their [[Āgama (Hinduism)|agama]]s as Hinduism or Hindu worship has been revived. The revival of Hinduism in Indonesia has given rise to a national organisation, the [[Parisada Hindu Dharma]].

===Newer movements===

===Slavic Vedism or Neo-Vedism===

'''p. 222''': «In addition to Ukrainian Paganism, Russian and Pan-Slavic varieties of Paganism and "Slavic Vedism" can also be found in Ukraine».&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="religionip.ru"&gt;Portal "Religion and Law".

Slavic Vedism involves the use of Vedic rituals and worship of ancient Vedic deities, distinguishing from other groups which have maintained a stronger bond with modern [[Hinduism in India|Indian Hinduism]], although [[Krishnaism|Krishnaite]] groups often identify themselves as "Vedic" too. Also some syncretic groups within [[Rodnovery]] (Slavic Neopaganism) use the term "Vedism"&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Saunders, Vlad Strukov. ''Historical Dictionary of the Russian Federation''. The Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishing Group, 2010. '''p. 412'''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Aitamurto2007"&gt;Kaarina Aitamurto.

Aleksanteri Institute, University of Helsinki, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and worship Vedic gods, but mainstream Rodnovery is characterised by its use of indigenous Slavic rituals and Slavic names for the gods.

==Cross-denominational influences==
===Atman Jnana===
{{Main|Jnana|Moksha}}

Jñāna is a Sanskrit word that means ''knowledge''. In [[Hinduism|Vedas]] it means true knowledge, that ([[Atman (Hinduism)|atman]]) is identical with [[Brahman]]. It is also referred to as '''[[Atman (Hinduism)|Atma]] Jnana''' which is frequently translated as ''[[self-realization]]''.

===Bhakti movement===
{{main|Bhakti movement}}

The Bhakti movement was a [[theism|theistic]] devotional trend that originated in the seventh-century [[Dravidian peoples|Tamil]] south India (now parts of Tamil Nadu and Kerala), and spread northwards.&lt;ref name=schomer&gt;Schomer and McLeod (1987), The Sants: Studies in a Devotional Tradition of India, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120802773}}, pages 1–2&lt;/ref&gt; It swept over east and north India from the fifteenth-century onwards, reaching its zenith between the 15th and 17th century CE.&lt;ref name=schomer/&gt; The Bhakti movement regionally developed as Hindu denominations around different gods and goddesses, such as [[Vaishnavism]] (Vishnu), [[Shaivism]] (Shiva), [[Shaktism]] (Shakti goddesses), and [[Smartism]].&lt;ref name="lancenelson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sskumar"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wendy Doniger (2009), [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/63933/bhakti Bhakti], Encyclopædia Britannica; [http://www.himalayanacademy.com/readlearn/basics/four-sects The Four Denomination of Hinduism] Himalayan Academy (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; The movement was inspired by many poet-saints, who championed a wide range of philosophical positions ranging from [[theistic dualism]] of [[Dvaita]] to absolute [[monism]] of [[Advaita]] Vedanta.&lt;ref name=schomer/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christian Novetzke (2007), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/25691067 Bhakti and Its Public], International Journal of Hindu Studies, Vol. 11, No. 3, page 255–272&lt;/ref&gt; Scriptures of the Bhakti movement include the [[Bhagavad Gita]], [[Bhagavata Purana]] and [[Padma Purana]].&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Robinson (2005), Interpretations of the Bhagavad-Gita and Images of the Hindu Tradition, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415346719}}, pages 28–30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=karen26&gt;Karen Pechilis Prentiss (2014), The Embodiment of Bhakti, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195351903}}, pages 26–32, 217–218&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the legacy of the Alvars, five [[Vaishnava]] philosophical traditions (sampradayas) has developed at the later stages.&lt;ref name=Mittal2004&gt;{{cite book | author = Mittal, S. G. R. Thursby | year = 2006 | title = Religions of South Asia: An Introduction | publisher = Routledge | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Schools of Indian philosophy===
{{Main|Hindu philosophy}}
Hindu philosophy is traditionally divided into six [[Āstika and nāstika|''{{IAST|āstika}}'']] ({{lang-sa|आस्तिक}} "orthodox") schools of thought,&lt;ref&gt;For an overview of the six orthodox schools, with detail on the grouping of schools, see: Radhakrishnan and Moore, "Contents", and pp. 453–487.&lt;/ref&gt; or ''{{IAST|darśanam}}'' (दर्शनम्, "view"), which accept the [[Vedas]] as the supreme revealed scriptures. The schools are:
#[[Samkhya]], an atheistic and strongly dualist theoretical exposition of [[Purusha|consciousness]] and [[Prakṛti|matter]].
#[[Rāja yoga|Yoga]], a school emphasizing [[Dhyana in Hinduism|meditation]], [[Samadhi|contemplation]] and [[Kaivalya|liberation]].
#[[Nyaya]] or [[Indian logic|logic]], explores [[Pramāṇa|sources of knowledge]]. ''[[Nyāya Sūtras]]''.
#[[Vaisheshika]], an [[empiricist]] school of [[atomism]]
#[[Mimāṃsā]], an anti-ascetic and anti-mysticist school of [[orthopraxy]]
#[[Vedanta]], the last segment of knowledge in the Vedas, or the 'Jnan' (knowledge) 'Kanda' (section).

The [[nāstika]] schools are (in chronological order):
#[[Cārvāka]]
#[[Jainism]]
#[[Ājīvika]]
#[[Buddhism]]

However, [[Medieval philosophy|medieval philosophers]] like [[Vidyaranya|Vidyāraṇya]] classified [[Indian philosophy]] into sixteen schools, where schools belonging to [[Saiva]], [[Pāṇini]] and [[Rasesvara|Raseśvara]] thought are included with others, and the three [[Vedantic]] schools [[Advaita]], [[Vishishtadvaita]] and [[Dvaita]] (which had emerged as distinct schools by then) are classified separately.&lt;ref name="cowell"&gt;Cowell and Gough, p. xii.&lt;/ref&gt;

In  [[History of Hinduism|Hindu history]], the distinction of the six orthodox schools was current in the [[Gupta period]] "golden age" of Hinduism. With the disappearance of Vaisheshika and Mimamsa, it was obsolete by the later Middle Ages, when the various sub-schools of Vedanta ([[Dvaita]] "dualism", Advaita Vedanta "non-dualism" and others) began to rise to prominence as the main divisions of religious philosophy. Nyaya survived into the 17th century as ''Navya Nyaya'' "Neo-Nyaya", while Samkhya gradually lost its status as an independent school, its tenets absorbed into Yoga and Vedanta.

The '''House of the Vestal Virgins''' ({{Lang-la|Atrium Vestae}}; {{lang-it|Casa delle Vestali}}) was the residence of [[Vestal Virgin]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/0/18490233 ''Who were the Vestal Virgins?'' Lutwyche, J BBC]&lt;/ref&gt; located behind the circular [[Temple of Vesta]] at the eastern edge of the [[Roman Forum]], between the [[Regia]] and the [[Palatine Hill]]. The ''domus publica'', where the [[Pontifex Maximus]] dwelled, was located near the Atrium until that role was assumed by the emperors.

The ''Atrium Vestae'' was a three-story 50-room palace in the ancient Roman Forum built around an elegant elongated [[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]] or court with a double pool. To the very east is an open vaulted hall with a statue of [[Numa Pompilius]], the mythological founder of the cult.

The complex lay at the foot of the Palatine Hill, where a [[sacred grove]] that was slowly encroached upon lingered into Imperial times, when all was swept away by the [[Fire of Rome]] in 64. The House of the Vestals was rebuilt several times in the course of the Empire. After the dissolution of the College of the Vestals and the introduction of compulsory Christianity by [[Theodosius I]] in the late 4th century AD, the House of the Vestals continued to serve as a residence building. It now housed officials of the imperial court, and subsequently the papal court. Archaeological finds from this period include a hoard of 397 gold coins from the 5th century and another 830 Anglo-Saxon coins dating from the 9th and 10th centuries. The site was abandoned in the 11th/12th century.

Today, remains of the statues of the Vestals can be seen in the ''Atrium Vestae''.

'''Rabbi Yitzhak Saggi Nehor''' (רַבִּי יִצְחַק סַגִּי נְהוֹר), also known as '''Isaac the Blind''' (c. 1160&amp;ndash;1235 in [[Provence]], France), has the Aramaic epithet "Saggi Nehor" meaning "of Much Light" in the sense of having excellent eyesight, an ironic euphemism for being blind. He was a famous writer on [[Kabbalah]] (Jewish mysticism). Some historians suspect him to be the author of the ''[[Bahir|Book of the Bahir]]'', an important early text of Kabbalah. Others (especially [[Gershom Scholem]], see his Origins of the Kabbalah, p.&amp;nbsp;253) characterize this view as an "erroneous and totally unfounded hypothesis".

He was the son of a famous talmudist [[Abraham ben David of Posquières]] (Raavad).

The ''Bahir'' first appeared in the Middle Ages, around 1200 CE in France. It discusses a number of ideas that became important for Kabbalah, and even though the origins of the anonymous work are obscure, there were important Kabbalists who were writing at the same time in France. The most influential of these was Isaac the Blind.

==Isaac the Blind's mystical concepts==
[[Image:Tree of Life, Medieval.jpg|thumb|left|Image popularly thought to be a portrait of Rabbi Isaac]]
He considered the [[sefirot]] as having their origins in a hidden and infinite level deep within the [[Ayn Sof]], or Divine Being (lit. That Without End).

He believed  that from  the Ayn Sof [[Emanationism|emanated]] [[Makhshava]] (Divine Thought), which  was the first  supernatural quality. The  rest of the sefirot  emanated from the Divine Thought.  Individual beings  in the world  are material manifestation of the  [[sefirot]], albeit on a lower level of reality. Mystic experience aids in reascending the levels  of emanations  to unite with Divine Thought.

The most famous student of Isaac the Blind was [[Azriel (Jewish mystic)|Azriel]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2272">The '''Catholic Church in [[Libya]]''' consists solely of Latin exempt missionary pre-diocesan jurisdictions, so there is no [[ecclesiastical province]] as they are all immediately subject to the [[Holy See]] and its missionary [[Roman Congregation Propaganda Fide]].
&lt;br&gt;There is no national [[episcopal conference]], but all Libyan sees are members of the [[Regional Episcopal Conference of North Africa]] (like those of its host [[Morocco]] as well as [[Algeria]], [[Tunisia]] and [[Western Sahara]]).

There formally is also an [[Apostolic Nunciature]] as papal diplomatic representation (embassy-level) in Libya, but it's vested abroad, currently in the Apostolic Nunciature to [[Malta]].

== Current Latin jurisdictions ==
''all pre-diocesan and missionary, hence exempt

; entitled to a [[titular bishop]]
* [[Apostolic Vicariate of Benghazi]]
* [[Apostolic Vicariate of Derna]]
* [[Apostolic Vicariate of Tripoli]]

; other
* [[Apostolic Prefecture of Misrata]]

== Defunct jurisdictions ==
All Ancient (arch)dioceses faded but were nominally restored as Latin [[titular see]]s :
:TO WIKIFY/CHECK
* A Metropolitan [[Titular archbishopric]] : [[Archdiocese of Darnis]]
* twenty-three [[Titular bishopric]]s : [[Diocese of Ammoniace]], [[Diocese of Antiphræ]], [[Diocese of Antipyrgos]], [[Diocese of Barca]], [[Diocese of Berenice]], [[Diocese of Boreum]], [[Diocese of Cyrene]], [[Diocese of Dystis]], [[Diocese of Erythrum]], [[Diocese of Gergis]], [[Diocese of Gigthi]], [[Diocese of Leptis Magna]], [[Diocese of Oëa]], [[Diocese of Olbia (Libya)]], [[Diocese of Parætonium]], [[Diocese of Ptolemais in Libya]], [[Diocese of Sabrata]], [[Diocese of Sinnipsa]], [[Diocese of Sozusa in Libya]], [[Diocese of Tacapæ]], [[Diocese of Teuchira]], [[Diocese of Villamagna in Tripolitana]], [[Diocese of Zagylis]].

There are no other former jurisdictions without current successor.

'''Mandisa Lateefah Thomas''' (born 1976) is the founder and president of Black Nonbelievers Inc. She has spoken at [[Secularism|secular]] conferences and events and has promoted the group's message in a variety of media outlets.

==Early life and background==
Thomas' upbringing was in a nonreligious, single-parent household, but she describes her grandmother as "staunchly religious".{{R|"myAJC_Poole"}}{{R|"CodeSwitchPod_2017"}}{{R|"Zuckerman_SecularLife"}}
Although Thomas sang in a church choir as a child, she considered the singing to be "just performing".{{R|"Jet_2012"}}
She describes learning, during her many "difficult conversations" with others in black society, that her own family includes more atheists than she first expected.{{R|"CloserLook_Writeup"}}{{R|"CodeSwitchPod_2017"}}
She considers religion, and Christianity in particular, to have been ingrained into the African-American identity by force.{{R|"CloserLook_Writeup"}}
She credits her upbringing with enabling her to see and understand this aspect of the historical ties between religion and the black identity in the United States. Within the African-American community, Thomas says that discussing this problematic history is often perceived as a form of betrayal or a rejection of one's own race.{{R|"CloserLook_Audio"}}{{R|Playboy_AmongAtheists}}

At the age of twenty-one, Thomas moved with her husband to [[Atlanta]], where cultural factors made it difficult to lead a secular life. Among broader secular circles, where black Americans are underrepresented, Thomas' experience has ranged from feeling welcomed, to isolated, to ignored.{{R|"CNN_Confessions"}} This experience led her to found Black Nonbelievers.{{R|"CloserLook_Writeup"}}{{R|"Zuckerman_SecularLife"}}

==Black Nonbelievers==
===Founding principles and motivation===
Thomas founded Black Nonbelievers, Inc. in 2011 as a secular fellowship.{{R|"GS_SOS_BNI"}}{{R|"Zuckerman_SecularLife"}} Its goals include eliminating stigma, increasing visibility, and providing support and networking opportunities around non-belief in the African-American community.{{R|"CloserLook_Writeup"}}{{R|"CloserLook_Audio"}}{{R|"CNN_Confessions"}}{{R|Playboy_AmongAtheists}}
She believes it is important to expand diversity within the black community to include people who challenge the effectiveness of the church and its doctrine, and who advocate for "more tangible, evidence-based solutions" to the challenges facing the community.{{R|"CloserLook_Audio"}}{{R|Playboy_AmongAtheists}} Black Nonbelievers is a non-profit organization {{R|FTR_Mar_2018}} whose leadership is mostly female and includes [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] representation.{{R|TheHumanist_201807}}

===Events===
The organization's local chapters organize events in each of ten U.S. cities.{{R|"BN_Official_Site"}} Besides group discussions, the group's regular meetings have included poetry readings, singing, bowling nights, holiday dinners, and community volunteerism including highway litter cleanup.{{R|"Zuckerman_SecularLife"}}
In November 2017, Thomas was a speaker at Black Nonbelievers' first annual Convention at Sea, a shipboard gathering and lecture series.{{R|"Meetup_AtSea_2017"}} She is also scheduled to speak during the second iteration of this event, planned for November 2018.{{R|"Meetup_AtSea_2018"}} In addition to speaking, she is a primary organizer for this event.{{R|"Meetup_AtSea_2017"}}{{R|"Meetup_AtSea_2018"}}{{R|FTR_Mar_2018}}

Thomas says that Black Nonbelievers has seen increasing interest from individuals, media outlets, and other organizations interested in working together.{{R|"CloserLook_Audio"}} The organization partners with other secular organizations including [[African Americans for Humanism]], which ran a 2012 billboard campaign depicting Thomas alongside [[Langston Hughes]].{{R|"Religion_2012"}}{{R|"AAHumanism_WeAreAAH"}} Other partner organizations include [[Out Campaign#Openly Secular|Openly Secular]] and the [[Freedom From Religion Foundation]].{{R|"CBS_Rocca"}}{{R|FTR_Mar_2018}}

Thomas has said that Black Nonbelievers is willing to set aside differences in ideology and work with faith-based organizations to address problems facing the African-American community. She describes how disclosing one's non-belief can present a barrier when approaching such organizations, but adds that this need not be the case. She has commented that no monopoly exists on fellowship and community, while also stating that the church has a considerable advantage in that area.{{R|"CloserLook_Audio"}}{{clear}}

'''Midrash HaGadol''' or '''The Great Midrash''' ([[Hebrew]]: '''מדרש הגדול''')  was written by Rabbi [[David Adani]] of Yemen (14th century) compilation of [[aggadic midrashim]] on the [[Pentateuch]] taken from the two [[Talmuds]] and earlier [[Midrashim]] of Yemenite provenance.&lt;ref&gt;All of the extant manuscripts used in printing the ''Midrash HaGadol'' were taken out of Yemen, and/or are in the possession of Yemenite Jewish families. In the ''Midrash HaGadol''`s Introduction to the Book of Deuteronomy, it cites the various manuscripts used in reproducing its printed copy, one of which belonging to Yosef and Avraham Sharabi; one of which now in the Hebrew University Library collection; four of which in the ''[[Mossad HaRav Kook]]'' library collection; one of which belonging to the Ben-Zvi Institute library collection; one of which being a private collection belonging to Dr. Meir Benayahu; and the last one belonging to the Bodleian Library collection in Oxford, England (opp. add. 4&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; 124a), all of which being of Yemenite Jewish provenance. There is another manuscript now in the Berlin ''Staatsbibliothek'' Library (Or. 1207), also of Yemenite Jewish provenance, as noted in its colophon. In the Introduction to the ''Midrash HaGadol'' (on Numbers), ''Mossad Harav Kook'' edition, other manuscripts are also mentioned, one of which belonging to Azriel Abyadh-HaLivni; another belonging to the late Yisrael Yeshayahu; another belonging to Rabbi Yechiel Shelomo Kessar; another to Rabbi Shalom Tzabari; another to the Rambam Library in Tel-Aviv; and yet another to the Dr. Israel Mehlmann Library in Jerusalem, ''inter alia''. Other manuscripts were known to be in the possession of the late Rabbi Shalom b. Yosef Halevi Alsheikh and of the Hibshush brothers in Tel-Aviv, as well as private collections in the hand of the late Mordechai Margulies and of Rabbi Y. L. HaCohen Fishman, as noted in the Introduction to the ''Midrash HaGadol'' (on Genesis), ''Mosad HaRav Kook'' edition.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it borrows quotations from the [[Targums]], and [[Maimonides]]&lt;ref&gt;E.g. in the ''Midrash HaGadol'' on Exodus 30:34 (''Mossad HaRav Kook'' edition), s.v. '''נטף ושחלת וחלבנה''', the glosses makes note of the fact that the quotation used in the ''Midrash HaGadol'' on the Holy Incense has been taken directly from Maimonides' [[Mishneh Torah]] (''Seder Avodah''), ''Hil. Kelei HaMikdash'' 2:4, whose words are these: '''והשחלת היא הציפורן שנותנין בני אדם במוגמרות, וחלבנה כמו דבש שחור היא וריחה קשה והיא שרף אילנות בערי יון'''. There are many other scattered excerpts taken from Maimonides' Code of Jewish Law, and Zvi Meir Rabinowitz makes note of this anomaly in his Preface to the ''Midrash HaGadol'' (on Numbers) in the ''Mossad HaRav Kook'' edition, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kabbalistic]] writings {{Harv|Oesterley|Box|1920}}, and in this aspect is unique among the various midrashic collections. This important work—the largest of the midrashic collections—came to popular attention only relatively recently (late 19th century) through the efforts of [[Jacob Saphir]], [[Solomon Schecter]], and [[David Zvi Hoffman]]. In addition to containing midrashic material that is not found elsewhere, such as the ''Mekhilta of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai'', the Midrash HaGadol contains what are considered to be more correct versions of previously known [[Talmudic]] and [[Midrashic]] passages.

== Discovery ==
The existence of the ''Midrash HaGadol'' was first brought to the attention of Jewish scholarship by [[Jacob Sapir]], who in his ''Even Sapir'' (1866) reports seeing a manuscript of the work in the possession of the Chief Rabbi of [[Jews of Yemen|Yemen]] {{Harv|Fish|1957}}. His remarks about the "discovery" are reproduced in {{Harvtxt|Fish|1940}},&lt;ref&gt;''Midrash HaGadol'', on Book of Numbers, Forward written by Fish, [http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=38104&amp;st=&amp;pgnum=5&amp;hilite= pp.5–ff.].&lt;/ref&gt; where he describes a work on the entire [[Pentateuch]] containing "twice as much as our [[Midrash Rabbah]]". (It is worth noting that while this collection was new to European Jewry, it was probably well known to the [[Jews of Yemen]].) The first manuscript was brought from [[Yemen]] to [[Jerusalem]] and then to [[Berlin]] in 1878 by a certain Mr. Shapira, and this Midrash subsequently became the subject of much scholarly attention. There are currently approximately two hundred manuscripts of this work residing in various public and private Hebraica collections, according to the catalog of the ''Institute of Microfilmed Hebrew Manuscripts''.
[[File:Midrash hagadol manuscript.png|thumb|left|350 px|Manuscript page from '''Midrash HaGadol''' on Genesis.]]
The ''Midrash HaGadol'' on [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] was first published by [[Solomon Schecter]] in 1902. A large portion of ''Midrash HaGadol'' on [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] was then published by [[David Zvi Hoffman]] in 1913. ''Midrash HaGadol'' on [[Book of Numbers]] was published by S. Fisch in 1940 in a more accessible style than the previous efforts, which were principally arranged for a scholarly audience. More recent editions listed by {{Harvtxt|Strack|Stemberger|1991}} are those on Genesis and Exodus by M. Margulies (1967), on [[Leviticus]] by E.N. Rabinowitz (1932) and [[A. Steinsalz]] (1975), on Numbers by E.N. Rabinowitz (1973), and on [[Deuteronomy]] by S. Fish (1972). The [[Mossad HaRav Kook]] Institute in Jerusalem has also published a five-volume edition.

== Authorship ==
According to {{Harvtxt|Higger|1934}}, the work dates to the late 14th century. A discussion of its authorship is provided in {{Harvtxt|Fish|1940}}, wherein he reviews the evidence in favor of the three then-prevailing opinions regarding authorship of the Midrash HaGadol, variously that it is the work of [[Rambam]], his son [[Abraham ben Rambam]], the author according to [[Maharitz (Yihya Salah)|Maharitz]] (an opinion disputed in later generations),&lt;ref&gt;See ''infra''., note on Avraham Al-Naddaf.&lt;/ref&gt; or David bar Amram al-Adeni.&lt;ref&gt;[[Avraham Al-Naddaf]], in his book, ''Ḥoveret Seridei Teiman'' (חוברת שרידי תימן), published in Jerusalem in 1928, pp. 7a-b (letter "gimel"), and which contains an inventory of books of Yemenite Jewish provenance, attributes the book to David bar Amram al-Adeni. See ''Ḥoveret Seridei Teiman'', [http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=32338&amp;st=&amp;pgnum=14&amp;hilite= pp. 14–15] in PDF.&lt;/ref&gt; After discounting [[Rambam]] as a possible author, and reviewing some compelling factors in favor of the other two possible authors, {{Harvtxt|Fish|1940}} offers the conciliatory hypothesis that the work was composed in the [[Arabic language]] by [[Abraham ben Rambam]], and translated into Hebrew by David al-Adeni. While Dr. Fish offers possible explanations for how the work—if indeed authored by Abraham ben Rambam in [[Egypt]]—came first to be "lost" and then to be rediscovered in Yemen, {{Harvtxt|Strack|Stemberger|1991}} find the attribution to Abraham ben Rambam "only extremely weakly attested," and report that modern scholars almost uniformly attribute the work in its entirety to David bar Amram al-Adeni. S. Fish concedes this as well in his [[Encyclopedia Judaica]] article on the topic.

== Sources ==
{{Eras of the Halakha}}
The ''Midrash HaGadol'' contains material from [[Mekhilta of Rabbi Shimon|Mekhilta de-Rabbi Shimon]], [[Sifre Zutta]], [[Mekilta le-Sefer Devarim|Mekhilta on Deuteronomy]], [[Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael|Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael]], [[Sifre]], and other unknown midrashic sources. In addition, the midrash makes use of the work of [[Rambam]] and [[Isaac Alfasi|Alfasi]], as well as many [[geonic]] writings {{Harv|Strack|Stemberger|1991}}, but the sources are never cited—a unique characteristic of this midrash {{Harv|Fisch|1940}}. All these various sources are fused in such a way that the product is a new literary creation in which the original ingredients can frequently not be unambiguously discriminated.

A "Midrash HaGadol that was brought from [[Aden]]" is cited by [[Joseph Shalit Riqueti]] in ''Sefer Chochmat HaMishkan'' (1676), but it is not known whether this is the same as the work under consideration here.

'''Naam Karan''' is a Sikh ceremony of naming a child and it usually takes place in a [[Gurdwara]] (Sikh place of worship) after the baby and mother are medically and physically healthy to attend the Gurdwara. There is no timetable for this  and the family should not feel undue pressure of any kind and only the well being of the mother and child are considered. Normally just involves the closest family members attending the local Gurdwara.

As soon as the family is ready to undertake this ceremony, the father or another senior member of the family makes contact with their local Gurdwara and makes arrangements for this brief ceremony.

On the day of the Naam Karan, the family, all invited guests, the mother, and baby attend the normal weekly [[kirtan]] of the [[Sangat (term)|Saadh Sangat]] of the  congregation. The family makes arrangements to have [[Karah Prasad]] said for the occasion. Various [[Shabda|Shabad]]s of thanks, joy and support are sung followed by the short Anand Sahib (6 pauris). Then if a Sahaj Paath has been arranged, the [[Bhog]] of this reading  takes place. 

Then comes the main part of the ceremony which is the naming of the baby. The [[Ardas]] is done in the normal way with a request to God (the one God we all share, not a specific Guru as was previously written in this space) to grant the child good health; make him or her a dedicated [[Sewadar]] of the country and [[Panth]]; to enlighten (?) the name of his family and [[Dharma]]; and to ask for a name for the child. The Ardas is followed by the [[Hukamnama]].  When the Hukamnama is taken, the first letter of the first word of the Hukam is the letter to be used to give the name to the child. So for example if the Hukam is: 

{{Quote|ਸਗਲ ਮਨੋਰਥ ਪ੍ਰਭ ਤੇ ਪਾਏ ਕੰਠਿ ਲਾਇ ਗੁਰਿ ਰਾਖੇ ॥ ਸੰਸਾਰ ਸਾਗਰ ਮਹਿ ਜਲਨਿ ਨ ਦੀਨੇ ਕਿਨੈ ਨ ਦੁਤਰੁ ਭਾਖੇ ॥੧॥ &lt;br&gt;
sagal manorath parabh tay paa-ay kanth laa-ay gur raakhay.&lt;br&gt; sansaar saagar meh jalan na deenay kinai na dutar bhaakhay. ॥1॥&lt;br&gt;

God has fulfilled all my desires. Holding me close in His embrace, the Guru has saved me.&lt;br&gt;He has saved me from burning in the ocean of fire, and now, no one calls it impassable. ॥1॥&lt;br&gt;

ਜਿਨ ਕੈ ਮਨਿ ਸਾਚਾ ਬਿਸ੍ਵਾਸੁ ॥ ਪੇਖਿ ਪੇਖਿ ਸੁਆਮੀ ਕੀ ਸੋਭਾ ਆਨਦੁ ਸਦਾ ਉਲਾਸੁ ॥ ਰਹਾਉ ॥&lt;br&gt;
jin kai man saachaa bisvaas. paykh paykh su-aamee kee sobhaa aanad sadaa ulaas. rahaa-o. &lt;br&gt;
Those who have true faith in their minds, continually behold the Glory of the Lord; they are forever happy and blissful. ॥ Pause॥&lt;br&gt;

ਚਰਨ ਸਰਨਿ ਪੂਰਨ ਪਰਮੇਸੁਰ ਅੰਤਰਜਾਮੀ ਸਾਖਿਓ ॥  ਜਾਨਿ ਬੂਝਿ ਅਪਨਾ ਕੀਓ ਨਾਨਕ ਭਗਤਨ ਕਾ ਅੰਕੁਰੁ ਰਾਖਿਓ ॥੨॥੨॥੨੬॥ &lt;br&gt;
charan saran pooran parmaysur antarjaamee saakhi-o. &lt;br&gt;jaan boojh apnaa kee-o naanak bhagtan kaa ankur raakhi-o. ॥2॥2॥26॥&lt;br&gt;
I seek the Sanctuary of the feet of the Perfect Transcendent Lord, the Searcher of hearts; I behold Him ever-present.&lt;br&gt; In His wisdom, the Lord has made Nanak His own; He has preserved the roots of His devotees. ॥2॥2॥26॥ |ਧਨਾਸਰੀ  ਮਹਲਾ  ੫  ॥ Dhanaasree mehlaa 5. Dhanaasaree, Fifth Mehl:
 SGGS page 677}}

The first word of the [[Hukam]] is "Sagal" so the child's name should start with the first letter, which is "S" – The [http://www.sikhwomen.com/SikhNames/ article here] has hundreds of names to help the family decide on a name in advance of the ceremony.

Once the name for the baby has been chosen, the word "Kaur" is added to the names of girls and the name "Singh" is added to the names of boys. The Gianni will pronounce the name of the child in the Sangat and hail the Jakara – [[Bole So Nihal]] – Sat Shiri Akal.

That completes the ceremony. The parents should then begin calling the child with the name pronounced in the Sangat and this should be then registered with the legal authorities.

[[File:Parikrama.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Parikrama at the temple]]
Parikrama or Pradakshina refers to circumambulation of sacred places in Hindu, Jain or Buddhist context, and the path along which this is performed. '''Parikrama''' means "the path surrounding something" in [[Sanskrit]], and is also known as '''Pradakshina''' ("to the right"), representing [[circumambulation]].&lt;ref name="Bowker"&gt;{{cite book | last=Bowker | first=John | title=The Oxford Dictionary of World Religions | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=1999 | location=New York | isbn=0-19-866242-4 | page=224 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both words are mostly used in the context of religious deities in a temple, sacred rivers, sacred hills and a close cluster of temples, and "doing a parikrama" as a symbol of prayer is an integral part of [[Worship in Hinduism|Hindu worship]].&lt;ref name="Bowker"/&gt;&lt;ref name =hindu_net&gt;http://www.hindunet.org/faq/fom-serv/cache/31.html Why do we perform Pradakshina or Parikrama?&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hindu"&gt;http://www.hinduism.co.za/kaabaa.htm Kaaba a Hindu Temple?Hindus invariably circumambulate around their deities&lt;/ref&gt; In Hinduism and other Indian religions, the Parikrama inside temples or sacred sites is traditionally clockwise.&lt;ref name=ds2002/&gt;&lt;ref name=gitlitz113&gt;{{cite book|author1=Linda Kay Davidson|author2=David Martin Gitlitz|title=Pilgrimage: From the Ganges to Graceland : an Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YVYkrNhPMQkC&amp;pg=PA113|year=2002|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-57607-004-8|page=113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Hindu temple structures include various Pradakshina paths. Pradakshina paths are defined.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indoarch.org/arch_glossary.php Architecture of the Indian Subcontinent &amp;mdash; glossary]&lt;/ref&gt; as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Circumbulatory or pathway around the shrine of the temples by keeping time is a common form of prayer in India.It includes Narmada,Shetrunjaya,Girnar. This pathway made of stone around the shrine is called Pradakshina path.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There could be one surrounding the main deity, other paths could be broader being concentric to the main path. However, it is not uncommon to find non-concentric parikrama paths in a single temple structure. At times the outermost parikrama path covers the whole village/town/city, thereby implying that the length of the path can stretch.&lt;ref name =hindu_net/&gt;

Parikrama is done around sacred fire ([[Agni]] – the fire God), Tulsi plant&lt;ref name= concept&gt;http://www.kamat.com/indica/culture/sub-cultures/pradakshina.htm The Concept of Pradaksina&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Ocimum tenuiflorum]]) and [[Ficus religiosa|Peepal tree]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindubooks.org/temples/tamilnadu/darbhasayanam/page9.htm Darbashayanam]&lt;/ref&gt; Parikrama of Agni or Agni Pradakshina is  a part of the  [[Hindu]] marriage ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weddingdialogues.com/July_and_August_Custom.html Some reflections on fire  in Hindu and other wedding ceremonies, and on Agni Pradakshina, circling the fire.]&lt;/ref&gt;
Some of the Parikramas are [[Narmada River]], [[Govardhan hill]], [[Vrindavan]], [[Vraj]] Mandala, Dwadash Madhav parikrama Tirthraj Prayag, Ayodhya, Girnar, Chitrakoot  hill, Varanasi, Mathura, and Mathura-Vrindavan yugalabandi in Kartik .....

Typically, Parikrama is done after the completion of traditional worship (puja) and after paying homage to the deity. Parikrama is supposed to be done with a meditative mood.

== Buddhist practice ==
[[File:StupaCircumDevotees.jpg|thumb|right|[[Buddhist]] [[monks]] and devotees circumambulating a [[stupa]]]]
[[File:Labrang03.jpg|thumb|upright|Pradakhshina round a stupa in China]]
In Buddhism circumambulation or pradakhshina has been an important ritual since early times. Sacred structures such as [[stupa]] or images have a pradakhshina path around them. The [[chaitya]] is a distinct ancient type of building that only survives in [[Indian rock-cut architecture]], a hall with a stupa at the far end, always built with a rounded [[apse]]-like end, to alllow pradakhshina.&lt;ref&gt;Michell, George, ''The Penguin Guide to the Monuments of India, Volume 1: Buddhist, Jain, Hindu'', p. 66, 1989, Penguin Books, {{ISBN|0140081445}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A mandapa (prayer hall), added in the front transforms the original stupa into the stupa shrine &amp;mdash; as a sacred entity which requires a circumambulatory path around it for the purpose of worship. The whole structure is planned in such a way that it becomes the centre of  the mandala and symbolically represents [[Mount Meru]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Chitkara | first=M. G. | title=Tibet, a reality | publisher=APH | year=1994 | isbn=978-81-7024-639-8 | pages=37–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Buddhist faithful may perform pradakhshina by [[prostration|prostrating]] themselves at every step, thus greatly prolonging the process. The most extreme pradakhshina is that of the sacred [[Mount Kailash]] in [[Tibet]], a [[Mount Kailash#Pilgrimage|mountain trek]] some 52&amp;nbsp;km (32&amp;nbsp;mi) long, at altitudes between 15,000&amp;nbsp;ft (4,600 m) and 18,200&amp;nbsp;ft (5,500 m).  This may also be undertaken by Hindus and Jains, and some pilgrims progress by prostration, taking some weeks.

== Similarity and difference with Islam ==
Like Parikrama in Hinduism, Muslims perform circumambulation around [[Kaaba]] during their [[Hajj]] which they call [[tawaf]].&lt;ref&gt;World Faiths, teach yourself - Islam by Ruqaiyyah Maqsood. {{ISBN|0-340-60901-X}} page 76&lt;/ref&gt; The circumambulation during Hajj is done in a counterclockwise manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Morgan | first=Diane | title=Essential Islam a comprehensive guide to belief and practice | publisher=Praeger | year=2010 | isbn=978-0-313-36025-1 | page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hindu and Buddhist traditions, in contrast, circumambulate a shrine or sacred site clockwise.&lt;ref name=ds2002&gt;{{cite book|author=Deepak Sanan|year=2002|title=Exploring Kinnaur in the Trans-Himalaya|publisher=Indus Publishing|isbn=978-8173871313|page=234}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gitlitz113/&gt; The only exception is during paying last respects to a dead body during a cremation or event marking a funeral, where the traditional circumambulation in Indian religions is counter-clockwise.&lt;ref name=gitlitz113/&gt;

A legend related to goddess Parvati (Shiva's wife) and her two sons illustrates the importance of Pradakshina or Parikrama. It is said that the goddess asked her two sons to circumambulate the universe to gain worldly knowledge. While her first son Kartikeyan 
spent decades to go round the world on his peacock, his second son [[Ganesha]] walked a full circle around his mother and justified his action by stating that the [[World]] was contained within the figure of the mother. This legend justifies the importance that Hindus attach to the practice of Parikrama, and also the importance of motherhood in Hindu psychology. Another version of the same story replaces the figure of Parvati with Shiva himself.&lt;ref name = concept/&gt;

===Shiva temples===
In '''Shiva''' temples, the devotees start the Pradakshina as usual from the front and go clockwise till they reach the ''gomukhi'' (the outlet for [[abhisheka]] water) from the Sanctum Sanctorum. As usual the clockwise perambulation is maintained outside of the Bali stones. The drainage outlet for the  ritual ablution offered on the Shiva Linga with water, milk, curd, coconut water, ghee, ashes ('''bhasma''')etc. is not to be crossed. So the worshippers have to return in anti-clockwise direction till they reach the other side of the drainage outlet to complete the circle. During this anti-clockwise perambulation, the devotee should tread a path inside of the Bali stones. The Bali stones are always to be kept the right side of the devotees. After reaching the drainage oulet, they have to return to the front in the clockwise direction keeping the path outside the Bali stones. Thus one Pradakshina is completed.

==== Ayodhya parikrama ====
In the temple city of [[Ayodhya]] in [[Uttar Pradesh]], India, '''Panchkosi''' Parikrama is performed over a two-day period. Devotees first take a holy dip in the [[Saryu River]] and then do a Parikrama of 15&amp;nbsp;km along the periphery of the city. It is said that over two hundred thousand  devotees including around 50 thousand [[sadhus]] from [[Prayag]] ([[Allahabad]]), [[Haridwar]], [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]] and [[Varanasi|Kashi]] ([[Varanasi]]) participate in the parikrama, and full security arrangements are made for the religious occasion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indopia.in/India-usa-uk-news/latest-news/44855/National/1/20/1 Ayodhya]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Girnar parikrama ====
[[File:Girnar Parikrama Pilgrims.jpg|thumb|Pilgrims on [[Girnar Parikrama]]]]
Lili Parikrama or [[Girnar Parikrama]] is a seven-day festival held at  Mount [[Girnar]] in [[Junagadh]] district of [[Gujarat]], India. The pilgrimage involves a climb of 10,000 steps to reach the top to the sacred Mount Girnar venerated by both Hindus and [[Jainism|Jains]]. The Jains call it Mount [[Neminath]]. Devotees from all over the country participate in the festival. Of the seven peaks of Girnar, five are important viz., Ambamata, Gorakhnath, Augadh, Guru Dattatreya and Kalika. Bhavnath Shiv temple, Bhartruchari cave, Sorath Mahal, Bhim Kund and Shiv Kund. Devotees visit these sacred places during the parikarama.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indopia.in/India-usa-uk-news/latest-news/45284/National/1/20/1Devotees throng Mount Girnar for the 7-day fest]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Govardahan hill parikrama ====
[[File:Govardhan Temple.JPG|thumb|left|Govardhan Temple starting point of Govardhan Parikrama]]
[[Govardhan hill]] which has great religious significance in view of its association with [[Lord Krishna]],  presently at its highest point is just {{convert|25|m|adj=on}} high and is a wide hill near [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]] [[Vrindavan]] in [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[India]]. It is a narrow sandstone hill known as Giriraj which is about {{convert|8|km|0}} in length.&lt;ref name  = "giri_raj"&gt;http://www.girirajji.com/goverdhan-parikrama.html Goverdhan Parikrama,Govardhan Parvat Parikrama,Govardhan Hill Parikrama,Parikrama of Goverdhan,Parikrama of Govardhan Parvat,Parikrama of Govardhan Hill&lt;/ref&gt;
After Krishna protected the inhabitants of Vraj Vridavan from the wrath of [[Indra]], he counseled them to worship [[Govardhana hill]] and they did by way of a Puja (worship) and a Parikrama (circumambulation) around the hill.Thus, a festival in commemoration of the lifting of Mount Govardhan, near [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]], by [[Krishna]] came into vogue as 'Govardhan Puja' when Mount Govardhan is worshipped, the day after [[Deepawali]] (festival of lights) is celebrated. Pious people keep awake the whole night and cook 56 (or 108) different types of food for the bhog (the offering of food to God) to Krishna. This ceremony is called 'ankut' or 'annakuta' which means a mountain of food. Various types of food – cereals, pulses, fruit, vegetables, chutneys, pickles, and salads – are offered to the Deity and then distributed as 'prasada' to devotees. Thousands of devotees bring offerings for Giriraj. Followed by this pooja, the devotees perform the Govardhana Parikrama.&lt;ref name  = "giri_raj"/&gt;
[[File:Shahadin 001.jpg|thumb|[[Krishna]] lifting the [[Govardhana hill]]]]
Govardana Parikrama [circumambulation &amp;mdash; going {{convert|21|km}} around the hill] is a sacred ritual performed by many believers as spiritual purification. There is no time limit for performing this Parikrama, but for those who perform the dandavata (full prostration) Parikrama, an arduous form which may take weeks and sometimes even months to complete. Dandavata Parikrama is performed by standing in one spot, offering obeisances like a stick (danda) by lying flat on the ground and then continuing, contiguously, till the entire route is covered. It is also said that some sadhus (Hindu holy men) perform 108 obeisances in one spot before moving to the next. This can take a number of months to complete.&lt;ref name  = "giri_raj"/&gt;

This ritual of Parikrama is considered to be even better if is it done with milk. A clay pot filled with milk, with a hole at the bottom, is carried by the devotees in one hand and a pot filled with dhoop (incense smoke) in another. An escort continuously fills up the pot with milk till the parikrama is completed. Parikrama is also done with candy being handed out to children, en route.&lt;ref&gt;[http://heenainindia.blogspot.com/2006_07_01_archive.html Know Thyself: July 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; The divine tree 'Kalpavriksha' planted by GreenMan Vijaypal Baghel at each Kunda of this parikrma route, not only Kalpavriksha, he is planting with dedication much more others traditional &amp; medicinal flora's species around holy Govardhan hill likely 'Tridev Vriksha', paras peepal, Rudraksha, Kadmba, pakad, vat vriksha etc. who have spiritual and religious values to make Green Parikrma. 
Parikrama of Govardhana hill starts at the Manasi-Ganga Kund (lake) and then after having darsan of Lord Harideva, from Radha-kunda village, where the Vrindavan road meets the parikrama path. After parikrama of 21 &amp;nbsp;kilometres, covering important tanks, shilas and shrines such as Radha Kunda, Syama Kunda, Dan Ghati, Mukharavinda, Rinamochana Kunda, Kusuma Sarovara and Punchari, it ends at Mansi Ganga Kund only.&lt;ref name  = "giri_raj"/&gt;

====Kurukshetra parikrama====
[[File:48_kos_parikrama.jpg|thumb| Map with description of 48 kos parikrama (approx. 96 miles circle) around the holy city of Kurukshetra, displayed at [[Kurukshetra#Places of interest|Ban Ganga/Bhishma Kund]]]]
[[48 kos parikrama of Kurukshetra]] is a 48 [[Kos (unit)|kos]] circumambulation of over 200 [[Mahabharata]]-related and other [[vedic period|vedic era]] [[Tirtha (Hinduism)|tirthas]] around the holy city of [[Kurukshetra]] in the state of [[Haryana]], India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kurukshetra.nic.in/MAPs/ReligiousMap/map.jpg |title=Kurukshetra map |website=kurukshetra.nic.in | accessdate=24 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hartour"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://haryanatourism.gov.in/showpage.aspx?contentid=5106 | title=Haryana Tourism | accessdate=24 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cmhry"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://haryanacmoffice.gov.in/newsupdates/details/id/737 | title=Development of all pilgrimage sites located within a radius of 48 kos (miles) of Kurukshetra would be carried out |date=11 October 2015| publisher=Chief Minister's Office, Haryana | accessdate=24 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="harekrsna"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.harekrsna.com/sun/features/05-12/features2460.htm | title=The 48 Kos Kurukshetra Region | publisher=harekrsna.com | accessdate=24 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

====Narmada parikrama====
The importance of the [[Narmada River]] as sacred is testified by the fact that the pilgrims perform a holy pilgrimage of a Parikrama or [[Circumambulation]] of the river. The Narmada Parikrama, as it is called, is considered to be a meritorious act that a pilgrim can undertake. Many [[sadhus]] (saints) and pilgrims walk on foot from the [[Arabian Sea]] at [[Bharuch]] in [[Gujarat]], along the river, to the source in Maikal Mountains ([[Amarkantak]] hills) in [[Madhya Pradesh]] and back along the opposite bank of the river. It is a {{convert|2600|km|adj=on}} walk.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.indiatravelforum.in/threads/narmada-parikrama.1926/ Narmada Parikrama]&lt;/ref&gt; The Parikrama is also performed  along the southern bank from its source (Amarkantak hills) to the mouth (Bharuch) and returning along the northern bank, and it is considered to be of the highest religious efficacy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gyandoot.nic.in/dhar_district/geo.html Dhar District - Geography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081015191258/http://www.gyandoot.nic.in/dhar_district/geo.html |date=2008-10-15 }}. Gyandoot.net. Retrieved on 2013-12-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Narmada Parikrama, devotees have to pass through a place called  Shulpaneshwar ki Jhari, a religious place in Gujarat with links  dating back to the [[Mahabharata]] epic story. The legend says that the [[Pandavas]] returning victorious from [[Kurukshetra]] war were intercepted at  Shulpaneswar by  [[Eklavya]] and his group of tribal  [[Bhils]] and looted them (Pandvaas) of all their belongings. Since then it is a custom that pilgrims on a Narmada Parikrama, while passing through this place, expect to be stripped of all their belongings leaving them with the bare essentials to carry on till some philonthropists give them donations on the way to carry on. With construction of the Sardar Sarovar Dam in Gujarat on the [[Narmada River]], the Shulpaneshwar Temple has submerged under the reservoir, necessitating the pilgrims to take a circuitous route to continue on their journey.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080706094154/http://www.boloji.com/spirituality/119.htm Parikrama]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Vraja Mandala parikrama ====
Since 500 years [[Vraja]] Mandala Parikrama has been performed during October&amp;ndash;November months. It is 84 Krosh long, taking 1–2 months depending on the route and speed visits twelve forests, known as vans, and twenty-four groves, known as upavans. The twelve forests are [[Madhuvan]], Talavan, Kumudvan, Bahulavan, Kamavan, Khadiravan, Vrindavan, Bhadravan, Bhandiravan, Belvan, Lohavan, and Mahavan. The twenty-four groves are Gokul, Govardhan, Barsana, Nandagram, Sanket, Paramadra, Aring, Sessai, Mat, Uchagram, Kelvan, Sri Kund, Gandharvavan, Parsoli, Bilchhu, Bacchavan, Adibadri, Karahla, Ajnokh, Pisaya, Kokilavan, Dadhigram, Kotvan, and Raval.

==== Vrindavan parikrama ====
[[File:Navadwipa Mandala Parikrama 2008.JPG|thumb|right|Parikrama by [[ISKCON]] devotees]]
Vrindavan Parikrama is a spiritual walk undertaken by devotees around [[Vrindavan]] town in Uttar Pradesh. It has no particular start or end place. As long as you end at the same place you start, the purpose is served. One possible path is to start from the famous ISKCON temple, covers a distance of {{convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on}}in about three hours. It is generally done on Ekadasi (eleventh lunar day of the [[waxing]] and [[waning]] of [[Moon]]). The route followed is from Keshi ghat with purification, walk close to the [[Krishna]] [[Balarama]] Temple, the Krishna-Balarama tree, Gautam Rishi's Ashrama (located on the left while on the right is [[Varaha]] Ghata),  the Kaliya Ghata, Madana Mohana Temple with red sandstone tower, small wooden bridge, to Imli Tala,  the Imli Tala tree, Sringara Vata (on the right), the Kesi Ghat (one of the famous Monuments in Vrindavan),  the Tekari Rani temple, the Jagannatha temple and the small temple of Lord [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]]  and in the final stretch cross the Mathura-Vrindavan road. After crossing this road, after another 1&amp;nbsp;km walking, reach the starting point of the Parikrama. During the Parikrama, one chants the mantras ([[Jap]] or Hymns ) within, uses body power (Tap) to accomplish the Parikrama and keeps a fast (not eat anything) ([[Vrata]]) till the Parikrama is completed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radhavallabh.com/blog/parikrama-of-vrindavan/Parikrama Of Vrindavan]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symbolism===
The temple structure reflects the symbolism of the Hindu association of the spiritual transition from daily life to spiritual perfection as a journey through stages. Parikrama paths are present through which worshipers move  in a clockwise direction, starting at the sanctuary doorway and moving inward toward the [[sanctum sanctorum|inner sanctum]] where the deity is enshrined. This represents translation of the spiritual concept of transition through levels in life into bodily movements  by the worshipers as they move inwardly through ambulatory halls to the most sacred centre of spiritual energy of the deity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Shayana Pradakshinam===
'''Shayana Pradakshinam''' is done by [[prostration]] in a lying posture. It starts with a Sashtanga Namaskara in front of the sanctum sanctorum. In Sashtanga Namaskara, the devotees have eight parts of their bodies touching the ground. Thus forehead, chest, shoulders, hands and knees touch the ground. The folded hands will be directed always towards the deity. In this pose, the devotees circumambulate on the Pradakshina path. The relatives and friends of the devotees help them to roll around.

===Number of Pradakshinas===
For each deity, the minimum number of Pradakshinas to be done are specified.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6727">The '''religious views of John Milton''' influenced many of his works focusing on the nature of religion and of the divine. He differed in important ways from the [[Calvinism]] with which he is associated, particularly concerning the doctrines of grace and predestination. The unusual nature of his own [[Protestant]] [[Christianity]] has been characterised as both Puritan and Independent.&lt;ref&gt; http://darknessvisible.christs.cam.ac.uk/religion.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theological political writings==
===Church government===
{{main|Milton's antiprelatical tracts}}
After the start of the [[Bishops’ Wars]], a movement was started calling for the disestablishment of the Church of England and the religious hierarchy. Milton joined in on a pamphlet war that soon followed and produced his antiprelatical tracts. These pamphlets emphasize the need for an individual to be exposed to scripture without any interference from a church government or from a fixed liturgy that could possibly corrupt the individual.&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler 2003 p. 265–275&lt;/ref&gt;

===Divorce laws===
{{main|Milton's divorce tracts}}
Milton married in Spring 1642 but his wife soon left him. The legal statutes of England did not allow for Milton to apply for a divorce and he began examining the legitimacy of divorce.&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1974 p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Milton was motivated towards writing on the topic after reading a work of Martin Bucer that emphasized the scriptural legitimacy of divorce.&lt;ref&gt;Patterson 2003 p. 279&lt;/ref&gt; After publishing his divorce pamphlets, especially after ''[[Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce]]'', Milton developed a reputation as both a divorcer and a polygamist.&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1974 p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, Milton believed that a translation of Bucer's work, published as ''[[Judgement of Martin Bucer Concerning Divorce]]'', would convince Parliament of the truth behind his previous tract on divorce, but this did not happen.&lt;ref&gt;Patterson 2003 p. 287&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to pursue the topic until his wife returned to him and their marriage was reconciled.&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1974 pp. 3–4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paradise Lost===
{{main|Paradise Lost}}
''Paradise Lost'' is Milton's epic depiction of the [[Fall of Man]]. In the story, Adam and Eve are warned against the evils of Satan and are told of the war in Heaven in which Satan challenged God's throne and was cast down in punishment. Satan, in order to get revenge against God, tempts Eve into eating of the forbidden fruit of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, and Adam, out of love, joins with her in the disobedience so she will not be blamed alone. God punishes them by casting them out of Eden and exposing them to the pain of the world, but he promises them that his Son will descend and bring about their salvation.

===Paradise Regained===
{{main|Paradise Regained}}
''Paradise Regained'' follows ''Paradise Lost''; also an epic, it retells the [[Temptation of Christ]]. Much shorter than its predecessor, It places the Son, incarnated as Christ, against Satan who tries to tempt Christ and to discover who he is, but he is unable to before he finally gives up and Christ defeats him.

===Samson Agonistes===
{{main|Samson Agonistes}}
Milton's last work, ''Samson Agonistes'' is a closet drama based on the format of Greek tragedy, and describes the Biblical story of Samson. When Samson is betrayed and blinded, he calls upon God to use him one more time to effect his will and exact revenge upon God's enemies.

==Views==
===On the soul===
Milton believed in the idea of [[soul sleep]]ing or mortalism, which determines that the soul, upon death, is in a sleep like state until the [[Last Judgment]].&lt;ref&gt;Rumrich 2003 p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, he believed that Christ, when incarnated, merged his divine and human identities, and that both of these identities died during his Crucifixion.&lt;ref&gt;Barker 1942 p. 319&lt;/ref&gt; With such views on the nature of the human body and the soul, there is no possibility of a state of existence between death and the resurrection, and concepts such as Purgatory are outright denied. However, these views are not standard Calvinistic interpretations, but his views on what happens after the resurrection are orthodox Calvinistic doctrine: Christ, during the resurrection, would raise man up higher than the state he was in before the fall.&lt;ref&gt;McDill 1942 pp. 333–334&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious toleration===
John Milton called in the ''[[Areopagitica]]'' for "the liberty to know, to utter, and to argue freely according to conscience, above all liberties".  "Milton argued for [[disestablishment]] as the only effective way of achieving broad [[Religious toleration|toleration]]. Rather than force a man's conscience, government should recognize the persuasive force of the gospel."&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, William Bridges ''A Milton Encyclopedia, Volume 8''(East Brunswick, NJ: Associated University Presses, 1980)  pp. 71, 72 {{ISBN|0838718418}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also earned an M.Div. from [[Princeton Theological Seminary]]. His M. Div. thesis—based on experiences as an Assistant Chaplain at [[New Jersey Neuro Psychiatric Institute]]—dealt with patterns of schizophrenic speech.

'''Strange Universe''' was a United States [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] daily half-hour program about [[paranormal]] phenomena that aired from 1996 to 1998. Developed by [[Rysher Entertainment]] and Chris Craft Television, it debuted in 1996, hosted by [[Emmitt Miller]] and Dana Adams.&lt;ref name="var1"&gt;Hontz, Jenny (15 July 1996).

In February 1997 Adams was dropped as co-host and Miller became the only host.  At that point, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported that the show had a "weak" 1.2 [[Nielsen ratings|national rating]] over the past two months.&lt;ref name="ratings"&gt;(12 February 1997). Article on Variety archives, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The show was on the air from 1996 to 1998 for a total of 390 episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows 1946-Present]]|year=2003|publisher=Ballantine Books|isbn=0-345-45542-8|pages=1136}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It usually appeared on [[UPN]] network affiliates.&lt;ref name="vibe1"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=iCsEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA36&amp;dq=%22#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Stranger Than Paradise], ''[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]'' (March 1998)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="back2"&gt;(26 May 1997).

In 1996, for the first time in its broadcast history, it dedicated a full episode to subject of alleged footage from [[Area 51]] of an "alien interview". This was released in 1997 as [[Area 51: The Alien Interview]], directed by [[Jeff Broadstreet]], and starring [[Steven Williams]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rense.com/ufo/strangeu.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.locatetv.com/tv/strange-universe/1537303 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402175650/http://www.locatetv.com/tv/strange-universe/1537303 |archivedate=2015-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/strange-universe-devotes-entire-show-on-monday-april-14-to-exclusive-sneak-preview-of-alien-interview-smuggled-from-area-51-75095747.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ufomind.com/area51/list/1997/apr/a13-002.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0404780/?ref_=tt_trv_cnn&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6334">'''Šumma izbu''', “If a reject (= anomalous birth)” is an ancient [[Mesopotamia]]n compendium of around 2,000 [[Teratology|teratological]] omens, on 24 tablets probably formed from three separate earlier series on odd human births, ''šumma sinništu arâtma'', “if a woman is pregnant” (tablets 1–4), the ''šumma izbu'' proper, on physically malformed births (tablets 6–17), and anomalous animal births: goats (tablet 18), cattle and donkeys (tablet 19), horses (tablets 20–21), pigs (tablet 22), dogs (tablet 23), wild animals (tablet 24), lambs (tablet 5, possibly the oldest in the series) and sheep (distributed across tablets 18–24). Exemplars of ''izbu'' compendia first appear in the [[Babylonia#Old Babylonian period|old Babylonian period]] but it is not until the late second millennium that it is thought to have reached canonical form and exemplars of teratomantic texts from this era have been found in [[Assur]] and [[Babylon]] as well as further afield in [[Susa]], [[Emar]], [[Ugarit]] and [[Hattusa|Ḫattuša]]. The most complete form of the text comes from copies in the [[library of Ashurbanipal]].

==The text==

It was one of the works cited by the astrologer Marduk-šāpik-zēri as evidence of his learning in his letter to [[Ashurbanipal|Aššur-bāni-apli]] in search of employment. Its esoteric nature was emphasized by the royal astrologer Balasi, in his letter to the same king:

{{ quotation|Šumma izbu is difficult to interpret. The first time I come before the king, my lord, I shall (personally) show, with this tablet that I am sending to the king, my lord, how the omen in written. Really, [the one] who has [not] had (the meaning) pointed out to him cannot possibly understand it.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title = The Oxford Handbook of Cuneiform Culture | chapter = The education of neo-Assyrian princes | author = Silvie Zamazalová | editor = Karen Radner | editor2 = Eleanor Robson | publisher = Oxford University Press | date = 2011 | page = 319 }}&lt;/ref&gt; |Balasi|Letter to Aššur-bāni-apli}}

In common with other works of omens, each clause is formed from a [[Protasis (linguistics)|protasis]] giving the antecedent and an [[conditional sentence|apodosis]] giving the consequence. In common with the [[Esagil-kin-apli#The Sakikkū (SA.GIG)|Sakikkū (SA.GIG)]], it arranges the malformations ''ištu muḫḫi adi šēpi'', “from head to foot,” and in the color sequence: white, black, red, green–yellow, and variegated. Some of the tablets focus on malformations of single body parts, such as horns (tablet 9), eyes (tablet 10) and ears (tablet 11) and others record the behavior of adult animals as well as their offspring, such as tablet 22 which begins treating with the birth of piglets of monstrous shape (''kūbu'') and then goes on to describe the behavioral anomalies in sows, pigs in general, and wild boars.

The series includes omens of public apodoses (mostly tablets 1–17), “If a woman gives birth, and at birth (the child) is already as white as alabaster—end of the reign; omen of a despotic king,”&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title = The Omen Series Šumma Izbu | author = Erle Leichty | location = Locust Valley, NY | publisher = J. J. Augustin | date = 1970 | page = 67 }}  Šumma Izbu, Tablet IV, 12.&lt;/ref&gt; and private apodoses (mostly tablets 18–24), “If a woman gives birth to an ecstatic [''maḫḫu''], male or female, she has been impregnated in the street by a sinful man.” The sinful man being one who has leprosy (''garbānu'') or dropsy (''male mê'').&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title = This abled body: rethinking disabilities in biblical studies | chapter = The origins of the disabled body | author = Neal H. Walls | editor = Hector Avalos | editor2 = Sarah J. Melcher | editor3 = Jeremy Schipper | publisher = SBL | date = 2007 | page = 25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For the most part, private omens concerned the fortunes of the ''bēl bīti'', head of a household, or the owner of a flock or herd and related to life and death, health, general condition, relationship with the gods, social status, family and economic circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | title = The Omen Series Šumma Izbu: Internal Structure and Hermeneutic Strategies | author = Nicla De Zorzi | journal = KASKAL | volume = 8 | date = 2011 | pages = 43–46 }}&lt;/ref&gt; “If a woman gives birth to a dog: the owner of the house will die, and his house will be scattered; the land will go mad; pestilence.” For public omens, the subject might relate to the king and his immediate family, or more generally the country as a whole, “There will be bad times. The mother will bar her door against her daughter; there will be no [sense of] brotherhood.”&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title = The city besieged: siege and its manifestations in the ancient Near East | author = Israel Ephʻal | publisher = Brill | date = 2009 | page = 130 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work follows the common left-right polarity, where right is generally auspicious, left not so, where for example a deformity to the right ear is bad, to the left ear is good and two right ears are good whereas two left ears are perceived to be bad. The work shares much in common with some of the ''izbu'' omens in the [[Šumma ālu]] series, from which it may have borrowed, or alternatively provided a source for these “unprovoked” omens. A late Babylonian commentary relates some of the omens to astrological observations:

{{quotation|If you want to find the ''izbu'': (If) the constellation of the month passed by and you see half of it in the second month, there will be an ''izbu'' (such that) the child who will be born will be defective. If at the beginning of [[Capricorn (astrology)|Capricorn]] one of the planets reaches first visibility or reaches a stationary point or is high (and) another (planet) remains visible: women will bear twins. Capricorn (is relevant) for cattle. The ''izbu'' which began in [[Leo (astrology)|Leo]] inside the constellation Leo in front of the star Erua.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title = The Heavenly Writing | author = Francesca Rochberg | publisher = Cambridge University Press | date = 2004 | pages = 57, 61, 88–92 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Table-turning''' (also known as '''table-tapping''', '''table-tipping''' or '''table-tilting''') is a type of [[séance]] in which participants sit around a table, place their hands on it, and wait for rotations. The table was purportedly made to serve as a means of communicating with the spirits; the alphabet would be slowly called over and the table would tilt at the appropriate letter, thus spelling out words and sentences. The process is similar to that of a [[Ouija]] board. Scientists and skeptics consider table-turning to be the result of the [[ideomotor effect]], or conscious trickery.&lt;ref&gt;Rawcliffe, D. H.

==History==

When the movement of [[Spiritualism (religious movement)|Modern Spiritualism]] first reached Europe from America in the winter of 1852&amp;ndash;1853, the most popular method of consulting the [[spirit]]s was for several persons to sit round a table, with their hands resting on it, and wait for the table to move. If the experiment was successful the table would rotate with considerable rapidity, and would occasionally rise in the air, or perform other movements.

Whilst most spiritualist ascribed the table movements to the agency of spirits, two investigators, [[Agenor de Gasparin|Count de Gasparin]] and [[Marc Thury|Professor Thury]] of [[Geneva]] conducted a careful series of experiments by which they claimed to have demonstrated that the movements of the table were due to a physical force emanating from the bodies of the sitters, for which they proposed the name [[Ectenic Force|ectenic force]]. Their conclusion rested on the supposed elimination of all known physical causes for the movements; but it is doubtful from the description of the experiments whether the precautions taken were sufficient to exclude unconscious muscular action (the [[ideomotor effect]]) or even deliberate fraud.&lt;ref&gt;[[Frank Podmore|Podmore, Frank]]. (1897). [https://archive.org/stream/studiesinpsychic00podm#page/47/mode/2up ''Studies in Psychical Research'']. New York: Putnam. p. 47 "If neither the feet nor the hands of the sitters could be employed, the knees could apparently have been used without much risk, and Thury clearly could not watch both the upper and under surfaces simultaneously. One the whole, though the experiments were conducted with care and a laudable desire not to exaggerate the importance of the facts observed, the experimenters do not appear to have sufficiently realised the possibilities of fraud; and their results add little evidence for action of a psychic, or, as Thury has preferred to name it, ectenic force."&lt;/ref&gt;

In England table-turning became a fashionable diversion and was practised all over the country in the year 1853. [[John Elliotson]] and his followers attributed the phenomena to [[mesmerism]]. The general public were content to find the explanation of the movements in spirits, [[animal magnetism]], [[odic force]], [[galvanism]], [[electricity]], or even the rotation of the earth. Some [[evangelicalism|Evangelical]] clergymen alleged that the spirits who caused the movements were of a diabolic nature. In France, [[Allan Kardec]] studied the phenomenon and concluded in ''[[The Book on Mediums]]'' that some messages were caused by an outside intelligence as the message contained information that was not known to the group.

==Scientific reception==
[[File:Table lifting trick.png|thumb|Table lifting trick involving the use of a pin and slotted ring.]]

The Scottish surgeon [[James Braid (surgeon)|James Braid]], the English physiologist [[William Benjamin Carpenter|W. B. Carpenter]] and others pointed out, that the phenomena could depend upon the expectation of the sitters, and could be stopped altogether by appropriate [[suggestion]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://unsworks.unsw.edu.au/fapi/datastream/unsworks:11299/SOURCE01 Yeates, L.B., ''James Braid: Surgeon, Gentleman Scientist, and Hypnotist'', Ph.D. Dissertation, School of History and Philosophy of Science, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, University of New South Wales, January 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt; English physicist [[Michael Faraday]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Faraday|first=M.|date=1853-11-01|title=Experimental investigation of table-moving|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016003238921738|journal=Journal of the Franklin Institute|volume=56|issue=5|pages=328–333|doi=10.1016/S0016-0032(38)92173-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; devised some simple apparatus which conclusively demonstrated that the movements he investigated were due to unconscious muscular action.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Lamont (historian)|Lamont, Peter]]. (2013). ''Extraordinary Beliefs: A Historical Approach to a Psychological Problem''. Cambridge University Press. p. 129. {{ISBN|978-1-107-01933-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The apparatus consisted of two small boards, with glass rollers between them, the whole fastened together by [[india-rubber]] bands in such a manner that the upper board could slide under lateral pressure to a limited extent over the lower one. The occurrence of such lateral movement was at once indicated by means of an upright [[haystalk]] fastened to the apparatus. When by this means it was made clear to the experimenters that it was the fingers which moved the table, the phenomena generally ceased.

===Trickery===

Professional [[Stage magic|magicians]] and skeptics have exposed many of the tricks methods utilized by mediums to tip tables. The magician [[Chung Ling Soo]] described a method that involved a pin driven into the table and the use of a ring with a slot on the medium's finger. Once the pin entered the slot, the table could be lifted.&lt;ref&gt;[[Chung Ling Soo|Soo, Chung Ling]]. (1898). [https://archive.org/stream/spiritslatewriti00sooc#page/71/mode/2up ''Spirit Slate Writing and Kindred Phenomena'']. Munn &amp; Company. p. 71-72&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[John Mulholland (magician)|John Mulholland]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The multiplicity of methods used to tip and raise tables in a séance is almost as great as the number of mediums performing the feat. One of the simplest was to slide the hands back until one or both of the medium's thumbs could catch hold of the table top. Another way was to exert no pressure on the table at all, and in the event that the sitter opposite the medium did press on the table,  to permit the table to tip far enough away from him so that he could get the toe of one foot under the table leg. He would then immediately put pressure on his side, and, holding the table between his hands and his toe, move it about at will. By this method a small table can be made to float two feet off the floor... Another method was to catch the under side of the table top with the knee; and still another was merely to kick the table into the air.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Mulholland (magician)|Mulholland, John]]. (1938). ''Beware Familiar Spirits''. C. Scribner's Sons. p. 107. {{ISBN|0-684-16181-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''Temple of Dendur''' ('''Dendoor''' in nineteenth century sources) is an [[Ancient Egypt]]ian [[Egyptian temple|temple]] that was built by the Roman governor of [[Egypt (Roman province)|Egypt]], [[Gaius Petronius |Petronius]], around 15 BC, as one of many Egyptian temples commissioned by the emperor [[Augustus]]. It was dedicated to [[Isis]] and [[Osiris]], as well as two deified sons of a local [[Nubia]]n chieftain, Pediese ("he whom Isis has given") and Pihor ("he who belongs to [[Horus]]").&lt;ref name=Arnold1999&gt;{{cite book |first=Dieter |last=Arnold |title=Temples of the Last Pharaohs |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1999 |pages=244}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s, the temple was removed from its original location and given to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City|New York]], USA, where it has been exhibited since 1978.

==Architecture and artwork==
[[Image:Graffiti on Temple of Dendur.JPG|thumb|19th century graffiti]]
The temple is constructed from [[sandstone]] and measures {{convert|25|m|ft|sp=us|abbr=off}} from the front stone gate to its rear as well as {{convert|8|m|ft|sp=us|abbr=off}} from its lowest to its highest point. A {{convert|30|m|ft|sp=us|abbr=off|adj=on}} cult terrace overlooks the Nile.&lt;ref name=Arnold1999/&gt; From the gate, two flanking walls ran around the temple and isolated the structure from the cult terrace and the Nile river.&lt;ref name=Arnold1999/&gt; The temple is partly decorated with reliefs: the temple base is decorated with carvings of [[papyrus]] and [[Lotus flower|lotus]] plants growing out of the water of the [[Nile]], which is symbolized by depictions of the god [[Hapy]].  Over the temple gate as well as over the entrance to the temple proper, depictions of the [[Winged sun]] disk  of the sky god [[Horus]] represent the sky. This motif is repeated by the vultures depicted on the ceiling of the entrance porch. On the outer walls, Emperor Augustus is depicted as a [[pharaoh]] making offerings to the deities Isis, [[Osiris]], and their son Horus. The subject is repeated in the first room of the temple, where Augustus is shown praying and making offerings. Augustus is identified as "Caesar" (actually, "Qysrs", which is based on "Kaisaros", the Greek  version of Caesar). He is also called "Autotrator", an alteration of ''[[autokrator]]'', or autocrat, the Greek equivalent of ''[[imperator]]'', one of the emperor's titles. This misspelling seems to be deliberate, in order to achieve more symmetry in the hieroglyphs. In some other parts of the temple, however, the emperor is simply called "Pharaoh". The middle room, which was used for offerings, and the sanctuary of Isis at the rear of the temple are undecorated but for reliefs on the door frame and backwall of the sanctuary. The latter shows Pihor and Pedesi as young gods worshiping Isis and Osiris respectively. The {{convert|6.55|by|13|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} temple house is modest but well executed in design with two front columns, an offering hall and a sanctuary with a statue niche.&lt;ref name=Arnold1999/&gt; A crypt was also built into the rear wall while a rock chamber in the nearby cliffs may have represented the tombs of Pediese and Pihor who were said to have drowned in the Nile river.&lt;ref name=Arnold1999/&gt;

In the 19th century, [[graffiti]] were left on the temple walls by visitors from Europe. One of the most prominent pieces of graffiti ("A L Corry RN 1817", at eye level to the left as one enters the temple) was left by the British naval officer and later Rear Admiral [[Armar Lowry Corry]]. Another inscription was left by the Italian egyptologist [[Girolamo Segato]].

==Relocation==
[[Image:Temple of dendur drawing by henry salt.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The Temple of Dendur in its original location. Drawing by [[Henry Salt (egyptologist)|Henry Salt]].]]

The temple was dismantled and removed from its original location (modern name: Dendur, ancient name: Tuzis, about {{convert|80|km|mi|sp=us|abbr=off}} south of the town of [[Aswan]]) in 1963. This was accomplished as part of a wider [[UNESCO]] project,&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/activities/172/ Monuments of Nubia-International Campaign to Save the Monuments of Nubia] World Heritage Committee, UNESCO&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/activities/173/ The Rescue of Nubian Monuments and Sites], UNESCO&lt;/ref&gt; in order to save significant sites from being submerged by [[Lake Nasser]], following construction of the [[Aswan High Dam]].&lt;ref name=Arnold1999/&gt; In recognition of the American assistance in saving various other monuments threatened by the  dam's construction, [[Egypt]] presented the temple and its gate as a gift to the [[United States of America]], represented by [[Jacqueline Kennedy]] among others, in 1965. The stone blocks of the temple weighed more than 800 [[ton]]s in total with the largest pieces weighing more than 6.5 tons. They were packed in 661 crates and transported to the United States by the freighter m/v Concordia Star. In the United States, several institutions made bids for housing the temple, in a competition that was nicknamed the "Dendur Derby" by the press. Alternative plans proposed re-erecting the temple on the banks of the [[Potomac River]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] or on the [[Charles River]] in [[Boston]]. However, these suggestions were dismissed because it was feared that the temple's sandstone would suffer from the outdoor conditions. On April 27, 1967, the temple was awarded to [[The Metropolitan Museum of Art]], where it was installed in the Sackler Wing in 1978. Inside the Sackler Wing, designed by the architects [[Kevin Roche]], [[John Dinkeloo]], and associates, a reflecting pool in front of the temple and a sloping wall behind it, represent the Nile and the cliffs of the original location. The glass on the ceiling and north wall of the Sackler is stippled in order to diffuse the light and mimic the lighting in Nubia.

'''Teresa Helena Higginson''' (27 May 1844 – 15 March 1905) was an [[English people|English]] Roman Catholic mystic.

==Life==
Higginson was born in [[Holywell, Flintshire|Holywell]], [[Flintshire]], Wales in 1844 where her parents were staying whilst of pilgrimage to the shrine of St. Winefride.&lt;ref name=am&gt;[https://www.amazon.co.uk/Teresa-Helena-Higginson-Servant-Crucified/dp/0852441819 Teresa Helena Higginson], Amazon, Retrieved 24 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Her father Robert Francis Higginson was a Catholic and his wife was a convert. Higginson went to a convent school in Nottingham, and became a schoolteacher at [[Bootle]].&lt;ref&gt;Mary Heimann, [https://books.google.com/books?id=0ZRDrZcM3zUC&amp;lpg=PA43&amp;ots=1c1M4Qpd6n&amp;dq=Teresa%20Higginson&amp;pg=SL20-PA50#v=onepage ''Catholic Devotion in Victorian England''] (Clarendon Press 1995): 150. {{ISBN|9780198205975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During her life Higginson's hands and feet bled in a way known as [[stigmata]],&lt;ref name=am/&gt; she went into prayer trances that lasted days, and she "violently re-enacted" the scenes in the [[Stations of the Cross]].&lt;ref&gt;Mary Heimann, [https://books.google.com/books?id=0ZRDrZcM3zUC&amp;lpg=PA43&amp;ots=1c1M4Qpd6n&amp;dq=Teresa%20Higginson&amp;pg=PA43#v=onepage ''Catholic Devotion in Victorian England''] (Clarendon Press 1995): 43. {{ISBN|9780198205975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Higginson died in [[Chudleigh]] and was declared a [[Servant of God]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teresahigginson.com/ Life story], TeresaHigginson.com, Retrieved 24 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Higginson was discussed as a possible candidate for [[canonization]] in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/clip/5056107/teresa_helena_higginson_sainthood/ "Woman of Prayer-Trance Likely to be Made Saint"] ''Wilkes-Barre Times Leader'' (21 November 1928): 10. via [[Newspapers.com]]{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many letters written by Higginson are in the archives at [[St Augustine's Abbey, Ramsgate]], with duplicates at the [[Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral|Metropolitan Cathedral of Christ the King Liverpool]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://bollandlowe.net/dev/met-cath/history-heritage/cathedral-diocesan-archives/ Metropolitan Cathedral of Christ the King Liverpool, Archives.]&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Thiruvasakam'''" in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] means '''The Holy Text'''. Thiruvasakam is the report which was sent to humanity about the arrival of God to the world according to [[Ayyavazhi mythology]]. They are four in number, as written in the [[Akilattirattu Ammanai]].

==Thiruvasakam - 1==
The Thiruvasakam - 1 reads as follows:

''"The three great Godheads have taken cognisance of the state of disorder in the world. To rectify the same, we are writing this as a first step so that the [[Kalineesan]] might amend. We will come into the world as [[Narayana]] [[Pantaram]] in the year 1008. When we come, we will undertake a [[tavam]] and destroy the [[kaliyuga]]. [[Black magic]], trickery, [[witchcraft]], [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]], and the [[demon]]s and [[devil]]s will be thrown into fire.  Those who remain committed to these words of Thiruvasakam will attain [[Dharmapathi]], i.e. the abode of righteousness".''

With these words, the Thiruvasakam - 1 was sent out to the world.

The '''Tripuri''' (also '''Tipra''' or '''Tipperah''') people are the original inhabitants of the [[Twipra Kingdom]] in [[North-East India]] and [[Bangladesh]]. The Tripuri people through the [[Manikya dynasty]] ruled the [[Tripura (princely state)|Kingdom of Tripura]] for more than 2000 years until the kingdom joined the [[Dominion of India|Indian Union]] in 1949.

==History==
[[Image:Risa02.jpg|thumb|A [[rigwnai]] pattern.]]
Tripuris entered their present country through its north-eastern corner, settled there and gradually expanded their settlement and suzerainty over the whole of [[Tripura]]. They were able to expand their influence as far south as [[Chittagong]], as far west as [[Comilla]] and [[Noakhali]] (known during the British period as 'plains Tipperah') and as far north as [[Sylhet]] (all in present [[Bangladesh]]). The ruling dynasty passed through several periods of history and ruled Tripura for several centuries till 18th century, after which it became a colony of Britain. On 14 October 1949, Tripura was merged into the newly independent India.

==Language==
{{Main|Kokborok language}}
The Tripuri people mainly speak dialects of [[Kokborok]], the language which comprises the standard dialects of [[Debbarma]], [[Tripura]], [[Murasing]], [[Jamatia]], [[Noatia]], [[Reang(Bru)]], [[Koloi]], [[Uchui]], and [[Rupini]] spoken around [[Agartala]], and is the second official language of [[Tripura]]. There are estimated to be more than one million speakers of the dialects of Tripuri in Tripura, and additional speakers in [[Mizoram]] and [[Assam]] in India, and in Nepal, as well as [[Sylhet]] and the [[Chittagong]] Hill Tracts in [[Bangladesh]].

== Religion ==
According to the 2001 census, a majority of Tripuri people are [[Hindus]].&lt;ref&gt;http://censusindia.gov.in/Tables_Published/SCST/dh_st_tripura.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society==
[[Image:Risa01.jpg|thumb|A [[rigwnai]] pattern.]]
The indigenous Tripuri people comprises hill communities viz., Tipra, [[Reang]], [[Jamatia]], Kaipeng, [[Noatia]], [[Koloi]], [[Halam (ethnic group)|Halam]], etc. who migrated to this land in successive waves. They grew in isolation and were sometimes subjugated by one another. Each community had its own elementary social and administrative organisation starting from the village level and up to the chieftainship of the whole tribe.

These indigenous communities enjoy their traditional freedom based on the concept of self-determination. The relation between the king and the subject communities was as [[Maharaja]] (king) of Tripura-Missip or [[liaison officer]] [[Roy]] or headman of the community – [[Sardar]] of chief of the village – the individual. Earlier, only the [[Debbarma]] or Tipra ethnic group was included in the [[Tripuri Kshatriya]] group. Later, the Raja included other groups like [[Reang]], [[Jamatia]] and [[Noatia]] as well, in an attempt to foster a sense of kinship among the people under his reign.&lt;ref&gt;''Asian Studies'', Volume 4 by Netaji Institute for Asian Studies, p.4&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tripuri people have a rich historical, social and cultural heritage which is totally distinct from that of the mainland Indians. Their distinctive culture – as reflected in their dance, music, festivals, management of community affairs, dress and food habits – has a strong base. [[Kokborok]], the lingua franca of the 12 largest linguistic groups of the indigenous Tripuris and other dialects spoken in Tripura are of the [[Tibeto-Burman]] group and distinct from those spoken in India. There is no influence from those spoken by other peoples in the north-eastern region. The music composer father-son duo of S.D. Burma and R.D. Burma belong to the Tripura royal family.

The main indigenous Tripuri communities are:
* [[Debbarma]]
* [[Tripura]]
* [[Reang]] or Bru
* [[Jamatia]]
* [[Koloi]]
* [[Noatia]]
* [[Murasing]]
* [[Uchoi]]
* [[Rupini]]

==Daily living==
The Tripuris live on the slopes of hills in a group of five to fifty families. Their houses in these areas are built of [[bamboo]] or ''ua'' as it is called in [[Kokborok]] and raised five to six feet height to save themselves from the dangers of the wild animals. Nowadays a considerable section of this community are living in the plains and erecting houses like the plains people, adopting their methods of cultivation, and following them in other aspects of life, such as dress, manners, and cosmetics. Tripuri women wear a scarp, called ''rignai'', which reaches down just below the knee. They weave in their loin-loom a small piece of cloth, which they call ''[[risa (garment)|risa]]'', and they use this small piece of cloth as their breast garment.

==Tripuri games and sports==
{{Main|Tripuri games and sports}}
Like many parts of the world the Tripuri has traditional sports. It is common in almost all the clans of Tripuri. They are called ''thwngmung'' in Tripuri. Nowadays these traditional sports are being abandoned gradually, as Tripuris are attracted to modern games and sports. But some of the sports still played and preferred in rural Tripura.

'''''Vividha Tirtha Kalpa''''' is a widely cited&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=m_y_P4duSXsC&amp;pg=PA198&amp;lpg=PA198&amp;dq=vividha+tirtha+kalpa&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3yIB2tYFf9&amp;sig=CkxDMLOB6303UqE6kst7fHJSLwk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj0wt3sp_HMAhVWM1IKHdhQDPQQ6AEIRjAI#v=onepage&amp;q=vividha%20tirtha%20kalpa&amp;f=false Jaina Iconography,  Volume 1 of Jaina-rūpa-maṇḍana, Umakant Premanand Shah, Abhinav Publications, 1987, p. 198]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cort, J.

It is a compilation of about 60 Kalpas (sections), most of them give the accounts of major Jain [[Tirtha (Jainism)|Tirthas]]. 

''Vividha Tirtha Kalpa'' is an example of the tirtha-mala texts that are compilations about Jain Tirthas throughout India, ranging from [[Nirvana Kanda]] of [[Kundakunda]] to modern publications.

Jinaprabh Suri is said to have written three Jain prayers in Persian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jainpedia.org/themes/places/jainism-and-islam/jains-and-the-delhi-sultanate/contentpage/1.html Audrey Truschke, Jains and the Delhi Sultanate, JAINpedia, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Author==
Jinaprabha Suri lived during the rule of [[Muhammad bin Tughluq]]. He travelled widely and has left a record of contemporary events as well as oral traditions. He was born in Mohilvadi, Gujarat in the Tambi clan of [[Shrimal Jain]] community. He was initiated at the age of 8 and became an Acharya in [[Kharatara Gaccha]] at 23.

==Composition time==
Some of the Kalpas contain the date of compositions, although most are undated. The dates range from Samvat 1364 ([[Rajgir|Vaibhargiri Kalpa]]) to Samvat 1389.&lt;ref&gt;Vividha Tirth kalpa, Jinaprabha Suri, Hindi Translation by Bhanwarlal Nahta, Shri Jain Shvetambar Nakoda Parshvanath Tirtha, 1978&lt;/ref&gt; The last section of the book was written in 1332 CE in Delhi during the rule of Muhammad Bin Tuglaq.

The tirthas mentioned cover regions (as divided by Muni [[Jinvijay]]):
* Gujarat and Kathiawad
* Punjab and Uttar Pradesh
* Maharashtra
* Rajasthan and Malava
* Eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar
* Karnataka and Telangana

The description suggests that at that time, while the [[Svetambara]]-[[Digambara]] division had become distinct, the tirtha were visited by Jains of both sects. He describes the building and destruction of many temples in recent period.

"'''Who Are the Brain Police?'''" is a [[Frank Zappa]] song, performed by [[The Mothers of Invention]], released on the Mothers' debut album, ''[[Freak Out!]]''.  It was released by [[Verve Records]] as a single in 1966. Zappa stated that the song was one of religious theme.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NBfhgQf1-QwC&amp;pg=PA64&amp;dq=%2522Who+are+the+brain+police%2522&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=V2QVUs7BD-_i4APcjICQDA&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%2522Who%2520are%2520the%2520brain%2520police%2522&amp;f=false|title=Academy Zappa: Proceedings of the First International Conference of Esemplastic Zappology (ICE-Z)|last=Watson|first=Ben|last2=Leslie|first2=Esther|date=2005-01-01|publisher=SAF Publishing Ltd|isbn=9780946719792|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zappa wrote about the song on the ''Freak Out!'' liner notes:  "At five o’clock in the morning someone kept singing this in my mind and made me write it down. I will admit to being frightened when I finally played it out loud and sang the words."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aln2.albumlinernotes.com/Freak_Out_.html|title=Freak Out!|website=aln2.albumlinernotes|access-date=2016-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1988 interview, Zappa added:
{{quote|A lot of people police their own brains. They're like citizen soldiers, so to speak. I've seen people who will willingly arrest, try and punish their own brains. Now that's really sad. That's vigilante brain policism. It's not even official, it's like self-imposed.&amp;nbsp;... It's hard to pin it down to one central agency when you realize that so many people are willing to do it to themselves. I mean, the people who want to become amateur brain police, their numbers grow every day – people who say to themselves, 'I couldn't possibly consider that', and then spank themselves for even getting that far. So, you don't even need to blame it on a central brain police agency. You've got plenty of people who willingly subject themselves to this self-mutilation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wiki.killuglyradio.com/wiki/Interview_by_Bob_Marshall|title=Interview by Bob Marshall - Zappa Wiki Jawaka|website=wiki.killuglyradio.com|access-date=2016-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Song structure==
The song's structure was described in detail by [[AllMusic]]:
{{quote|Simply put, it is weird and creepy. A chorus of living-dead voices supports a slow and sloppy waltz beat. Lyrics make numerous references to melting plastic and chromium and repeatedly ask the question found in the song's title (answered by the brainless chorus). Halfway through, the song breaks into a fast-paced bridge; the same happens in the coda, which includes a kazoo solo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/who-are-the-brain-police-mt0044284074|title=Who Are the Brain Police? - The Mothers of Invention,Frank Zappa {{!}} Song Info {{!}} AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=2016-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Critical reception==
The song was stated to be a "direct defiance of top 40 radio".{{attribution needed|date=May 2016}} Repetitive lyrics were noted as part of this "defiance".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uAYfqgGf4yYC|title=The Words and Music of Frank Zappa|last=Lowe|first=Kelly Fisher|date=2007-01-01|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|isbn=0803260059|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song was also cited by [[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]] magazine as "one of the scariest songs to ever emerge from the rock psyche". While comparing it to [[Franz Kafka|Kafka]], ''Mojo'' described the song as "a vision of contemporary America where personal identity and individuality is erased".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AVQbF9lTBwgC|title=The Mojo Collection: 4th Edition|last=Magazine|first=Various Mojo|date=2007-11-01|publisher=Canongate Books|isbn=9781847676436|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
