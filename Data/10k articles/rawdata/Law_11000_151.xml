It was decided by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit|Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit]] on February 16, 1999.

==Background==
During the holiday season, [[Jersey City, New Jersey]] erected a [[nativity scene]], a [[Christmas tree]] and a [[Menorah (Hanukkah)|menorah]] on city property in front of City Hall.&lt;ref name="Schundler95"&gt;''Schundler'', 168 F.3d at 95.&lt;/ref&gt; The scene included Mary, Joseph, Baby Jesus and the Three Wisemen.&lt;ref name="Schundler95"/&gt; The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) asked the city to stop putting religious symbols on public property.&lt;ref name="Schundler95"/&gt; Jersey City put up a sign next to the display that read "Through this display and others throughout the year, the City of Jersey City is pleased to celebrate the diverse cultural and ethnic heritages of its peoples."&lt;ref name="Schundler95"/&gt; The ACLU filed a lawsuit saying that this display was unconstitutional because it violated the [[Establishment Clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].&lt;ref name="Schundler96"&gt;''Schundler'', 168 F.3d at 96.&lt;/ref&gt; The Federal District Court of New Jersey ordered the city to stop erecting its holiday display.&lt;ref name="SchundlerDNJ"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=American Civil Liberties Union v. Schundler |vol=931 |reporter=F. Supp. |opinion=1180 |pinpoint= |court=D.N.J. |date=1995 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/931/1180/2346616/ |accessdate=2017-11-01 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schundler96"/&gt; The City decided to appeal this ruling.&lt;ref name="Schundler96"/&gt; The City also erected a modified holiday display with the original menorah, Christmas tree and nativity and the City added a [[Santa Claus]], [[Frosty the Snowman]], a sled, [[Kwanzaa]] symbols on the tree and two signs.&lt;ref name="Schundler96"/&gt; The ACLU filed for [[contempt of court|contempt]].&lt;ref name="Schundler96"/&gt; After some back and forth with the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, the District Court ruled that the modified display did not violate the First Amendment.

==Decision==
The majority opinion of the court was written by Circuit Judge [[Samuel Alito]]. The Court used the test for the Establishment Clause from ''[[Lemon v. Kurtzman]]''.&lt;ref name="Schundler97"&gt;''Schundler'', 168 F.3d at 97, citing {{ussc|name=Lemon v. Kurtzman|volume=403|page=602|pin=612|year=1971}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This test looks at "whether a challenged government practice had a secular purpose, whether its principal or primary effect advanced or inhibited religion, and whether it created an excessive entanglement of the government with religion."&lt;ref name="Schundler97"/&gt; The Court also relied on two prior Supreme Court cases ''[[Lynch v. Donnelly]]'' and ''[[County of Allegheny v. ACLU]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Schundler'', 168 F.3d at 99-101, citing {{ussc|name=Lynch v. Donnelly|volume=465|page=668|pin=|year=1984}} and {{ussc|name=County of Allegheny v. ACLU
|volume=492|page=673|pin=|year=1989}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court stated that "we are unable to perceive any meaningful constitutional distinction between the display at issue here and those that the Supreme Court upheld in ''Lynch'' and ''Allegheny County''."&lt;ref name="Schundler108"&gt;''Schundler'', 168 F.3d at 108.&lt;/ref&gt; "None of these displays conveyed a message of government endorsement of Christianity, Judaism, or of religion in general but instead 'sent a message of pluralism and freedom to choose one's own beliefs."&lt;ref&gt;''Schundler'', 168 F.3d at 107, quoting ''Allegheny County'', 492 U.S. at 633.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court decided that the modified display did not violate the First Amendment.&lt;ref name="Schundler107"&gt;''Schundler'', 168 F.3d at 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to {{EPC Article|23|1}}, members of the Boards of Appeal may only be removed from office by the Administrative Council on a proposal from the Enlarged Board of Appeal. Two cases were successively initiated by the Administrative Council, but the Enlarged Board eventually dismissed both of them.&lt;ref name="G 2301/15"/&gt;&lt;ref name="G 2302/15"/&gt; In the third case initiated by the Administrative Council, the Enlarged Board decided not to propose the removal from office of Corcoran.&lt;ref name="G 2301/16"/&gt;

==Background==
{{main article|European Patent Organisation|Appeal procedure before the European Patent Office}}
The [[European Patent Convention]] (EPC) is a multilateral treaty instituting the legal system according to which European patents are granted. It contains provisions allowing a party to appeal a decision issued by a first instance department of the European Patent Office (EPO). The appeal procedure is under the responsibility of its Boards of Appeal, which are institutionally independent within the EPO. According to [[Robin Jacob]], the members of the Boards of Appeal are "judges in all but name".&lt;ref&gt;Sir Robin Jacob, ''National Courts and the EPO Litigation System'', [[GRUR Int.]] 2008, Vol. 8–9, pages 658–662, referring to what he said in ''Lenzing's Appn.'' [1997] RPC 245 at p. 277 and repeated in ''Unilin v. Berry'' [2007] EWCA Civ. 364. See also Leith, P, "Judicial and Administrative Roles: the patent appellate system in a European Context", Intellectual Property Quarterly, Issue 1, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

The members of the Boards of Appeal are appointed by the Administrative Council of the European Patent Organisation on a proposal from the President of the European Patent Office (EPO).&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|11|3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Administrative Council exercises disciplinary authority over the Board members and, during their five-year term, the Board members may only be removed from office "if there are serious grounds for such removal and if the Administrative Council, on a proposal from the Enlarged Board of Appeal, takes a decision to this effect."&lt;ref name="23-1"&gt;{{EPC Article|23|1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Administrative Council is also the appointing and disciplinary authority for the President of the EPO.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|10|1}}, {{EPC Article|11|1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, employees of the EPO, no matter whether they are members of the Boards of Appeal, may apply to the Administrative Tribunal of the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO) to resolve employment disputes they may have with the European Patent Organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|13|1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 December 2014, Patrick Corcoran, an Irish member of [[Boards of Appeal of the European Patent Office|Board of Appeal]] 3.5.05, "was escorted out of the [European Patent] Office by [EPO's] investigation unit," and [[Benoît Battistelli]], president of the EPO, imposed a "house ban" on him.&lt;ref name="MIP-20141209"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.managingip.com/Article/3408714/Is-the-EPO-in-crisis.html|title=Is the EPO in crisis?|last=Nurton|first=James|date=9 December 2014|work=Managing Intellectual Property|accessdate=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="juve-20141209"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.juve.de/nachrichten/namenundnachrichten/2014/12/skandal-im-europaeischen-patentamt-druck-auf-praesidenten-waechst-nach-hausverbot-fuer-richter|title=Skandal im EPA: Druck auf Präsidenten wächst nach Hausverbot für Richter |trans-title=Scandal at the EPO: Pressure on the President is increasing after exclusion order for judge|last=Klos|first=Mathieu|date=9 December 2014|work=JUVE|publisher=JUVE|language=German|accessdate=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="it13.12.17"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/irish-patent-judge-must-be-reinstated-in-munich-job-1.3319407|title=Irish patent judge must be reinstated in Munich job|last=Gallagher|first=Conor|date=December 7, 2017|work=The Irish Times|accessdate=26 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|According to the Enlarged Board in its decision Art. 23 1/16, Summary of Facts and Submissions, point VI, the President of the EPO also ordered his suspension on 3 December 2014.|group=notes}} In reaction, a number of members of the [[Appeal procedure before the European Patent Office#Enlarged Board of Appeal|Enlarged Board of Appeal]], the highest body of the EPO judiciary, wrote to the Administrative Council to express their concerns over this move, regarded as challenging the [[judicial independence]] of the Boards of Appeal.&lt;ref name="MIP-20141209"/&gt;&lt;ref name="juve-20141212"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WIPR-20141212"/&gt;&lt;ref name="juve-20141209"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IPKat-20141208,10,11"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ipkitten.blogspot.de/2014/12/breaking-news-enlarged-board-appeals.html|title=Breaking News: Enlarged Board appeals - direct to the Administrative Council|author=Merpel|date=8 December 2014|publisher=[[IPKat]]|accessdate=13 December 2014}}; {{cite web|url=http://ipkitten.blogspot.de/2014/12/leading-european-ip-judges-join-chorus.html|title=Leading European IP Judges join the chorus of condemnation|author=Merpel|date=10 December 2014|publisher=[[IPKat]]|accessdate=13 December 2014}}; {{cite web|url=http://ipkitten.blogspot.de/2014/12/six-more-judges-criticise-battistellis.html|title=Six more judges criticise Battistelli's actions|author=Merpel|date=11 December 2014|publisher=[[IPKat]]|accessdate=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Battistelli stated that he acted "in accordance with the rules at all times" and that he was "absolutely committed to the independence of the [EPO's] judiciary".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iam-magazine.com/blog/Detail.aspx?g=cd136e13-9c86-46d5-8d99-50796f594f29|title=EPO president defends his actions and achievements in the face of mounting criticism|last=Wild|first=Joff|work=[[Intellectual Asset Management|IAM]]|date=12 December 2014|publisher=Globe White Page Ltd|accessdate=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proceedings and decisions==
===June–September 2015: first case (Art. 23 1/15)===
Following an internal investigation, the Administrative Council requested on 25 June 2015 the Enlarged Board of Appeal to make a proposal for the removal from office of Corcoran, pursuant to {{EPC Article|23|1}} and Article 12a of the Rules of Procedure of the Enlarged Board of Appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epo.org/about-us/organisation/communiques.html#a18|title=145th meeting of the Administrative Council of the European Patent Organisation (Munich, 14-15 October 2015)|date=15 October 2015|publisher=European Patent Office|accessdate=18 October 2015|location=Munich}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JUVE Oct. 2015"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.juve.de/nachrichten/namenundnachrichten/2015/10/epa-amtsenthebungsverfahren-gegen-mitglied-der-beschwerdekammer-eingeleitet|title=EPA: Amtsenthebungsverfahren gegen Mitglied der Beschwerdekammer eingeleitet|trans-title=EPO: Dismissal procedure initiated against member of the Boards of Appeal |last1=Geimer |first1=Christina |last2=Klos|first2=Mathieu| date=16 October 2015|work=JUVE|publisher=JUVE|language=German|accessdate=24 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ilo-3960"/&gt; This was the first dismissal procedure instituted against a member of the Boards of Appeal in the history of the European Patent Office.&lt;ref name="JUVE Oct. 2015"/&gt;

In that first case, which received the case number "Art. 23 1/15" (also referred to as "G 2301/15"&lt;ref name="G 2301/15"/&gt;), the Administrative Council sent data which it said were sufficient evidence. In its decision issued in September 2015, the Enlarged Board indicated that the Council however failed to make a statement regarding the facts which should lead to removal from office, or give arguments why the evidence should lead to removal. The Enlarged Board thus dismissed the case. Namely, the Administrative Council's request for a proposal that Corcoran be removed from office was rejected as inadmissible.&lt;ref name="G 2301/15"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ipkitten.blogspot.de/2015/11/read-it-for-yourself-enlarged-board.html|title=Read it for yourself: Enlarged Board decision Art 23 1/15|last=Merpel|date=20 November 2015|publisher=IPKat|accessdate=2 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{EPO Case law book|iv|f|4|5}}: "Adversarial judicial proceedings"&lt;/ref&gt;

===October 2015–February 2016: second case (Art. 23 2/15)===
A second case, which received the case number "Art. 23 2/15" (also referred to as "G 2302/15"&lt;ref name="G 2302/15"/&gt;), was then initiated on 26 October 2015 and subsequently withdrawn by the Administrative Council. The Enlarged Board thus dismissed the case. It also ordered publication of the decision and proposed reimbursement of legal costs by the defendant.&lt;ref name="G 2302/15"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{EPO Case law book|iv|f|4|6}}: "Publication of the decision"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{EPO Case law book|iv|f|4|7}}: "Reimbursement of costs"&lt;/ref&gt;

===February–June 2016: third case (Art. 23 1/16)===
A third case, which received case number "Art. 23 1/16" (also referred to as "G 2301/16"&lt;ref name="G 2301/16"/&gt;), contained a redrafted request from the Administrative Council asking for a proposal for the removal of Corcoran. During first non-public oral proceedings held on 10 to 12 May 2016, the Enlarged Board of Appeal held that the Administrative Council's request was formally admissible for discussion as to its merits, unlike the first request filed in case Art. 23 1/15. The Enlarged Board also decided that public oral proceedings would be held in June 2016, in order to discuss the merits of the case. However, shortly before the scheduled oral proceedings, the Enlarged Board received a letter from the president of the EPO, who was not a party to the proceedings, indicating that he considered the planned public oral hearing and the hearing of witnesses from the Office as "unlawful". Following this intervention from the president of the EPO, the Enlarged Board considered that it could only proceed further with the proceedings if the chairman of the Administrative Council (the "petitioner" that started the proceedings, and appointing authority of the president) distanced himself from the letter. The Administrative Council replied, but the Enlarged Board deemed that the Administrative Council did not do so satisfactorily. The Board thus decided not to request removal from office of the defendant, i.e. Corcoran, without deciding on the substantive allegations made against him.&lt;ref name="G 2301/16"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.juve.de/nachrichten/namenundnachrichten/2016/06/eklat-am-epa-battistelli-greift-in-amtsenthebungsverfahren-ein|title=Eklat am EPA: Battistelli greift in Amtsenthebungsverfahren ein |trans-title=Scandal at the EPO: Battistelli intervenes in dismissal procedure|last=Klos|first=Mathieu|date=15 June 2016|work=JUVE|publisher=JUVE|language=German|accessdate=20 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/06/15/epo_president_caught_threatening_independent_appeal_board/|title=EPO president caught threatening independent appeal board|last=McCarthy|first=Kieren|date=15 June 2016|work=The Register|accessdate=13 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ipkitten.blogspot.fr/2016/06/enlarged-board-publishes-decision-epo.html|title=Enlarged Board publishes decision: EPO President violated judicial independence|last=Merpel|date=23 June 2016|publisher=IPKat|accessdate=25 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.juve.de/nachrichten/verfahren/2016/06/epa-streit-richter-fuehlen-sich-von-amtschef-battistelli-bedroht|title=EPA-Streit: Richter fühlen sich von Amtschef Battistelli bedroht |trans-title=EPO dispute: Judges feel threatened by office head Battistelli |last=Behrens|first=Sonja|date=28 June 2016|work=JUVE|publisher=JUVE|language=German|accessdate=20 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kluwerpatentblog.com/2016/11/07/rule-law-rechtsstaat-endangered-needs-defended/|title=The Rule of Law (Rechtsstaat) is Endangered and Needs to be Defended!|last=Bausch|first=Thorsten|at=Section 4|date=7 November 2016|work=Kluwer Patent Blog|accessdate=13 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent developments==
===Non-renewal of term of office===
In 2017, the Administrative Council did not renew Corcoran's term of office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.juve.de/nachrichten/namenundnachrichten/2017/10/battistelli-nachfolger-euipo-chef-campinos-soll-zum-epa-praesidenten-gewaehlt-werden|title=Battistelli-Nachfolger: EUIPO-Chef Campinos soll zum EPA-Präsidenten gewählt werden|first1=Mathieu|last1=Klos|first2=Christina|last2=Schulze|trans-title=Battistelli successor: EUIPO Head Campinos would have been elected EPO President|date=10 October 2017|work=JUVE|publisher=JUVE Verlag für juristische Information GmbH|accessdate=14 October 2017|quote="Ende 2014 suspendierte er einen Richter und erteilte ihm Hausverbot.

===ILO Administrative Tribunal decisions 3958 and 3960===
On 6 December 2017, the [[Administrative Tribunal of the International Labour Organization]] (ILO) issued two decisions, i.e. judgments 3958 and 3960,&lt;ref name="ilo-3958"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/dyn/triblex/triblexmain.fullText?p_lang=en&amp;p_judgment_no=3958&amp;p_language_code=EN|title=C.

===Lifting of "house ban", and further ILO decisions ===
The "house ban" issued in December 2014 was later lifted on 11 December 2017, and Corcoran resumed his work as member of the Boards of Appeal. However, as his five-year term as member of the Boards of Appeal was not renewed by the Administrative Council, he returned to work at the EPO first-instance departments in January 2018.&lt;ref name="JUVE-19.12.17"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.juve.de/nachrichten/namenundnachrichten/2017/12/disziplinarfall-am-europaeischen-patentamt-pyrrhussieg-fuer-suspendierten-richter|title=Disziplinarfall am Europäischen Patentamt: Pyrrhussieg für suspendierten Richter |trans-title=Disciplinary case at the European Patent Office: Pyrrhic victory for suspended judge |last1=Klos|first1=Mathieu |last2=Schulze|first2=Christina|date=19 December 2017|work=JUVE|publisher=JUVE|language=German|accessdate=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="25.01.2018-Dixon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ippropatents.com/ippropatentsnews/europenewsarticle.php?article_id=5682|title=EPO judge subject to “forced transfer”|last=Dixon|first=Barney|date=25 January 2018|work=IPPro Patents|publisher=Black Knight Media Ltd|accessdate=27 January 2018|location=Munich}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was then reportedly transferred from Munich, Germany, to the EPO branch in [[The Hague]], Netherlands, and assigned to a position outside his area of expertise.&lt;ref name=cicero-3.05.18&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cicero.de/wirtschaft/mobbing-internationale-organisationen-unternehmen-skandal|title=Mobbing bei internationalen Organisationen: Wo kein Richter...|trans-title=Harassment in international organisations: Where no judge... |last=Sorge|first=Petra|date=3 May 2018|work=[[Cicero (magazine)|Cicero]]|publisher=Res Publica Verlags GmbH|language=German|accessdate=29 June 2018}} (full article available [https://suepo.org/documents/44838/57488.pdf here]; and English translation available [https://www.suepo.org/documents/44838/57489.pdf here])&lt;/ref&gt; In the meantime, the Administrative Tribunal of the International Labour Organization (ILO) issued two further decisions, i.e. judgments 3959 and 3961, dismissing Corcoran's complaints relating to the confiscation of his USB memory stick by the EPO Investigative Unit on 3 December 2014, and to his "request that the Administrative Council [of the European Patent Organisation] investigate the alleged unauthorized disclosure of confidential information relating to the ongoing disciplinary procedure against him".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://patentblog.kluweriplaw.com/2018/01/30/ilo-administrative-tribunal-dismisses-complaints-epo-president/|title=ILO Administrative Tribunal dismisses complaints against EPO president|last=Kluwer Patent blogger|date=January 30, 2018|work=Kluwer Patent Blog|accessdate=3 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ilo-3959"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/dyn/triblex/triblexmain.fullText?p_lang=en&amp;p_judgment_no=3959&amp;p_language_code=EN|title=C.

===Criminal proceedings===
In 2018, it was revealed that Benoît Battistelli, then President of the EPO, and Željko Topić, one of EPO Vice-Presidents, had initiated [[criminal proceedings]] against Corcoran before courts in Munich. These proceedings eventually resulted in the Regional Court I of Munich ({{lang-de|Landgericht München I}}) declaring in November 2017, on appeal, Corcoran innocent of all charges, including the alleged defamation.&lt;ref name=cicero-3.05.18/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://patentblog.kluweriplaw.com/2018/06/20/landgericht-munchen-patrick-corcoran-innocent-acquitted-charges/|title=Landgericht München: Patrick Corcoran is Innocent and Acquitted of all Charges|last=Bausch|first=Thorsten|date=20 June 2018|work=Kluwer Patent Blog|publisher=Kluwer Law International|accessdate=29 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://patentblog.kluweriplaw.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/52/2018/06/EPA-v-Corcoran-LG-Munchen-2017-11-6.pdf|title=Landgericht München I, Az.: 24 Qs 18/17 1122 Bs 4/17 AG München (decision pronounced on 6 November 2017)|date=June 20, 2018|language=German|accessdate=30 June 2018}} (English translation [http://patentblog.kluweriplaw.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/52/2018/06/Trans.-EPOvsCorcoran-Dec.LG-MUC-6.11.17.pdf here])&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
In October 2015, [[Siegfried Broß]], a former judge of the German [[Federal Constitutional Court]] and the Patent Division of the [[Federal Court of Justice of Germany|Federal Court of Justice]], expressed the opinion that the procedure followed by the President and the Administrative Council did not comply with the [[rule of law]] and had been conducted in a manner comparable to criminal proceedings, and that confidentiality requirements had not been adhered to. He furthermore criticized the role of EPO's internal investigation unit.&lt;ref name="JUVE 29 Oct. 2015"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.juve.de/nachrichten/namenundnachrichten/2015/10/epa-disziplinarverfahren-verwaltungsrat-und-battistelli-handeln-ohne-rechtliche-grundlage|title=EPA-Disziplinarverfahren: "Verwaltungsrat und Battistelli handeln ohne rechtliche Grundlage"|trans-title=EPO Disciplinary Proceedings: Administrative Council and Battistelli are acting without legal basis|last1=Geimer |first1=Christina |last2=Klos|first2=Mathieu| date=29 October 2015|work=JUVE|publisher=JUVE|language=German|accessdate=25 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; EPO Vice-President Raimund Lutz strongly rejected these criticisms, stating that the disciplinary proceedings against the Board member were conducted by the EPO and the Administrative Council in accordance with the EPC provisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.juve.de/nachrichten/namenundnachrichten/2015/11/epa-disziplinarverfahren-amtsfuehrung-weist-kritik-von-ex-verfassungsrichter-zurueck|title=EPA-Disziplinarverfahren: Amtsführung weist Kritik von Ex-Verfassungsrichter zurück|trans-title=EPO Disciplinary Proceedings: Management of the Office rejects criticisms from former Constitutional Court judge |last=Klos|first=Mathieu|date=17 November 2015|publisher=JUVE|language=German|accessdate=3 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case has fueled the discussion about the lack of sufficient independence of the Boards of Appeal from the executive branch of the European Patent Office,&lt;ref name="JUVE-8.12.17"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JUVE-19.12.17"/&gt;&lt;ref name=cicero-3.05.18/&gt; and the shortcomings of the Administrative Tribunal of the International Labour Organization (ILO) in effectively resolving employment disputes within the EPO.&lt;ref name=cicero-3.05.18/&gt; It has also been cited as an example of what can go wrong in supranational organizations.&lt;ref name=cicero-3.05.18/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11488">[[Bullfighting]] was banned in the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous community]] of [[Catalonia]] by a vote of the [[Parliament of Catalonia|Catalan Parliament]] in July 2010. The ban came into effect on 1 January 2012. The last bullfight in the region took place in [[Barcelona]] in September 2011.

The ban, which ended a centuries-old tradition in the region, was supported by [[animal rights]] activists but opposed by some, who saw it as motivated by [[Catalan nationalism|political nationalism]] rather than animal welfare.

There is a movement to revoke the ban in the Spanish congress, citing the value of bullfighting as "cultural heritage." The proposal is backed by the majority of parliamentarians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Congreso español admite a debate corridas de toros|url=http://www.tauromaquias.com/2013/02/congreso-espanol-admite-debate-corridas.html|work=Tauro Maquais|accessdate=1 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ban was officially annulled for being unconstitutional by Spain's highest court on 5 October 2016.[http://www.lavanguardia.com/politica/20161005/41795044539/tribunal-constitucional-prohibicion-toros-catalunya.html]

==Bullfighting in Catalonia==

{{main|Bullfighting|Spanish-style bullfighting}}
[[File:050529 Barcelona 027.jpg|thumb|right|''[[La Monumental]]'' bullring in Barcelona]]

The earliest recorded fight in Catalonia took place in 1387, although, as elsewhere in Spain, it was not until the early 19th century that bullfighting in the region took its form as a modern spectator sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=El Parlament aprueba la abolición de las corridas de toros en Catalunya desde 2012|url=http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/776867/0/catalunya/corridas/toros/|work=20 minutos website|accessdate=25 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 20th century, it had become one of the major entertainment attractions in Catalonia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diaridegirona.cat/comarques/2011/01/29/torero-oloti-nardo-lliura-seves-accions-placa-al-municipi/461660.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The region still preserves some of the oldest bullrings in Spain, such as the ''Plaça Clarà'' in [[Olot]] (built in 1859),&lt;ref&gt;[http://portaltaurino.com/plazas/cataluna/girona/olot.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; and the bullring in [[Figueres]] (1894).&lt;ref&gt;[http://portaltaurino.com/plazas/cataluna/girona/figueras.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; The 1897 bullring in [[Girona]] was demolished in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.plusarquitectura.info/node/1105 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-09-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402233055/http://www.plusarquitectura.info/node/1105 |archive-date=2012-04-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://portaltaurino.com/plazas/cataluna/girona/gerona.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

The sport declined in popularity in recent decades. By 2011, the only operating bullring in Catalonia was [[La Monumental]] in [[Barcelona]], where 20 fights were organized in 2009. This compares to 284 fights organized in the [[Community of Madrid]] (with a similar population to Catalonia).&lt;ref name="LVstats"&gt;{{citation | title =Los toros en España: 1.848 corridas, 10.247 toros lidiados y 8.301 toreros | url = http://www.lavanguardia.es/politica/noticias/20100728/53973695245/los-toros-en-espana-1.848-corridas-10.247-toros-lidiados-y-8.301-toreros.html | newspaper = La Vanguardia | date = 29 July 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Nine fights were organized between April and July 2010.

==2010 ban==

A ban on bullfighting in Catalonia was approved by the [[Parliament of Catalonia|Catalan Parliament]] on 28&amp;nbsp;July 2010, following a petition (or [[Initiative|Popular Legislative Initiative]], PLI) organised by the PROU platform ([[Catalan language|Catalan]] for 'Enough!').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lamalla.cat/politica/article?id=386348 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706224153/http://www.lamalla.cat/politica/article?id=386348 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-07-06 |title=La prohibició de les corrides de braus a Catalunya es debat el 28 de juliol al Parlament |publisher=lamalla.cat |date=2010-07-06 |accessdate=2010-07-27 |language=Catalan }}&lt;/ref&gt; The petition attracted 180,000 signatures.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; The parliamentary vote was 68 votes for and 55 against, with 9 abstentions Catalonia became the second [[Autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous community]] in Spain to ban bullfighting after the [[Canary Islands]] did so in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Prohibidas las corridas de toros en Canarias | url = http://www.elpais.com/articulo/cultura/CANARIAS/Prohibidas/corridas/toros/Canarias/elpepicul/19910418elpepicul_12/Tes | newspaper = El País | date = 18 April 1991}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The ban came into force on 1&amp;nbsp;January 2012. Bullfights by matadors were banned in Catalonia at the end 2011 but bull-dodging, in which bulls are .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lavanguardia.es/politica/noticias/20100728/53973561269/el-parlament-de-catalunya-aprueba-prohibir-las-corridas-de-toros-a-partir-de-2012.html |title=El Parlament de Catalunya aprueba prohibir las corridas de toros a partir de 2012 |publisher=La Vanguardia |date=2010-07-28 |accessdate=2010-07-28 |language=Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt; not killed, remains lawful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/11/mouse-killer-bull-sueca-spain | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Giles | last=Tremlett | title=Mouse, the killer bull, draws cheering crowds to Sueca festival in Spain | date=11 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last bullfight in Catalonia took place on 25 September 2011 at La Monumental.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bullfighting in Barcelona to end with Catalonia ban|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15050706|work=BBC News website|accessdate=25 September 2011|date=25 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In October 2016 the Catalonian ban on bullfighting was overturned by the Spanish Constitutional Court. The Court ruled that, though an autonomous region is allowed to regulate bullfighting, an autonomous region is not in a legal position to fully ban such fights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/21/world/europe/spain-bullfighting-ban-catalan.html |title=Spanish Court Overturns a Ban Against Bullfighting in Catalonia |publisher=NY Times |date=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elmundo.es/cultura/2016/10/20/57f4cf5ee5fdea5e408b4611.html |title=El Constitucional anula la prohibición de los toros en Cataluña |publisher=El Mundo |date=21 October 2016 |language=Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==

The campaign to ban bullfighting in Catalonia was strongly supported by [[animal rights]] groups and gained the backing of celebrities including [[Ricky Gervais]] and [[Pamela Anderson]].&lt;ref name=Tremlett&gt;{{cite news|last=Tremlett|first=Giles|title=Catalonia votes to ban bullfighting|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/28/bullfighting-ban-spain-catalonia|accessdate=25 September 2011|newspaper=The Guardian|date=28 July 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents of the ban suggested that it was not motivated by animal welfare concerns, but by the desire of [[Catalan nationalism|Catalan nationalists]] to eradicate from the region something seen as culturally Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Abend|first=Lisa|title=Catalonia Bans Bullfighting, but the Fight Isn't Over|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2007038,00.html|accessdate=25 September 2011|date=28 July 2010|work=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been claimed that the Catalan economy will suffer as a result of the ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sullivan|first=Iain|title=Spain: Catalonia Bullfights Enter Final Weekend Before Ban|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/09/24/spain-catalonia-bullfights_n_978981.html|accessdate=25 September 2011|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=24 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ban did not cover the Catalan tradition of ''[[correbous]]'' (roughly meaning bulls running by the streets), including its [[bou embolat]] version, in which lit flares are attached to the horns of a bull, cited as an inconsistency by both opponents of the ban and animal rights activists.&lt;ref name=Tremlett/&gt;

==Popular Legislative Initiative==
The approval of the PLI repealed the exception to the second paragraph of Article 6 of the Animal Protection Act:&lt;ref name="prou"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prou.cat/proposta.php |title=La proposta de llei |publisher=Plataforma Prou! |accessdate=2010-07-28 |language=Catalan |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100725130032/http://www.prou.cat/proposta.php |archivedate=2010-07-25 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.llibertat.cat/content/view/7422/29/ |title=El Parlament debatrà la ILP contra les corregudes de bous |publisher=Llibertat.cat |accessdate=2010-07-28 |language=Catalan }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{quote|a) Bullfighting in places where, on the effective date of Law 3/1988, of March 4th, regarding animal welfare, there are bullrings built to perform it, to which access must be prohibited to persons under fourteen years of age.|Law 3/1988|&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gencat.cat/diari/5113/08094167.htm |title=Decret legislatiu 2/2008, de 15 de abril |work=DOGC |publisher=Generalitat de Catalunya |accessdate=2010-07-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; |language=Catalan  }}

And added to the first paragraph:&lt;ref name="prou" /&gt;
{{quote|f. Bullfights and bull shows that include the death of the animal and the application of the lance, the banderillas and the sword, as well as any bull shows of any type that are performed in bullrings or out of them, with the exception of celebrations with bulls that are referred to in section b) of the second paragraph of article 6.}}

'''''Bellott v. Mountjoy''''' was a [[lawsuit]] heard at the [[Court of Requests]] in [[Westminster]] on 11 May 1612 that involved [[William Shakespeare]] in a minor role. 

Stephen Bellott, a [[Huguenot]], sued his father-in-law Christopher Mountjoy, a tyrer (a manufacturer of ladies' ornamental headpieces and wigs) for the financial settlement that had been promised at the time of his marriage with Mary Mountjoy in 1604, a dowry of £50, which had been promised but never paid, and an additional £200, to be bestowed upon Bellott in Mountjoy's will. 

The records of the case were discovered in 1909 by the Shakespeare scholar [[Charles William Wallace]] and published by him in the October 1910 issue of ''Nebraska University Studies''. The importance of this minor case is that Shakespeare was a material witness in it; his signed deposition of evidence was among the papers. Several of the other witnesses referred to Shakespeare’s role in arranging the betrothal and in the negotiations about the dowry. He had been requested to take on the duties by Mountjoy's wife, Marie. The papers supply a roster of persons with whom Shakespeare was personally acquainted: the Mountjoys and their household and neighbours, including [[George Wilkins]], the playwright, novelist and brothel-keeper who may have been Shakespeare's collaborator on ''[[Pericles, Prince of Tyre]]''. The papers show that in 1604, Shakespeare was a lodger in the Mountjoys' house, at the corner of Silver and Monkwell Streets in [[Cripplegate]], [[London]]. It is the only evidence yet found of a particular London address at which Shakespeare lived.

In his deposition, Shakespeare admitted that he had played the role as go-between in the courtship of Stephen Bellott and Mary Mountjoy that other witnesses described. However, he said that he could not remember the crucial financial arrangements of the Bellott/Mountjoy marriage settlement.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, pp. 59-60.&lt;/ref&gt; Without that key testimony, the Court of Requests remanded the case to the overseers of the London Huguenot church, which awarded Bellott 20 [[noble (English coin)|nobles]] (or £6 13''s''. 4''p''.). A year later, though, Mountjoy still had not paid.&lt;ref&gt;Kornstein, pp. 18-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4621">The '''Inter-American Convention Against the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms, Ammunition, Explosives, and Other Related Materials ''' ('''CIFTA'''), originally the ''Inter-American Convention Against Illicit Firearms Trafficking in the Americas'', is an international [[firearms control]] treaty.

==History==
CIFTA as a program was approved during the First Plenary Session of the [[Organization of American States|OAS]] held on November 13, 1997. Its purpose was to establish a regional standard for the control of the illicit manufacturing and trafficking in firearms: the Inter-American Convention against the Illicit Manufacturing and Trafficking in Firearms, Ammunition, Explosives and Other Related Materiales. CIFTA emphasizes the need for authorizations or licenses of export, imports and transit; the reinforcement of the checkpoints for exports, amongst other things. The Convention thus seeks to promote and facilitate the cooperation and exchange of information and experiences between OAS Member States. The Convention established a Consultative Committee gathering a representative for each State Party in order to guarantee its implementation, to promote the exchange of information, to facilitate cooperation and foster training between States.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oas.org/dsp/espanol/cpo_cifta_armas.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

The treaty entered into force in 1998.&lt;ref name = Ratifications&gt;[http://www.oas.org/juridico/english/sigs/a-63.html Ratifications].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership==
As of 2013, the treaty has been ratified by 31 of the 34 states in the OAS. The states that have not ratified the treaty are [[Canada]], [[Jamaica]], and the [[United States]]. Each of the three non-ratifying states are signatories to it.&lt;ref name = Ratifications/&gt;

===United States===
{{USgunlegalbox}}
U.S. President Barack Obama has proposed that the [[U.S. Senate]] ratify CIFTA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Jake | last=Tapper |author2=Sunlen Miller |authorlink= | title=President Obama to Face Opposition from Gun Lobby, Possibly Democrats, to Ratify Treaty on Firearms Trafficking | date=April 17, 2009 | publisher= | url =http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2009/04/president-ob-18.html | work =ABC News | pages = | accessdate = 2009-05-05 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Opponents are concerned that the measures contained within CIFTA could criminalize activities such as reloading ammunition if they are done without a license. Other provisions make unlicensed modification to any weapon a serious crime. Furthermore, there are provisions that expand infractions to larger groups of people effectively holding an organization responsible for the actions of a single member.

{{animal testing}}
'''Cambridge University primate experiments''' came to public attention in 2002 after the publication that year of material from a ten-month undercover investigation in 1998 by the [[British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection]] (BUAV).&lt;ref name=cuttingedge&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buav.org/zerooption/index.html|title=Witness the Cutting Edge of British Medical Research|publisher=[[British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607143950/http://www.buav.org/zerooption/index.html#|archive-date=7 June 2007|access-date=24 February 2006|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The experiments were being conducted on 
[[marmoset]]s, and included the removal of parts of their brains intended to simulate the [[symptoms of stroke]] or [[Parkinson's disease#Signs and symptoms|Parkinson's disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Bird |first=Maryann |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,557018,00.html |title=Animal Passions|magazine=Time magazine|date=7 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the research was theoretical, aimed at advancing knowledge of the brain, while some of it was applied.&lt;ref name=BUAVCU/&gt;

BUAV said the investigation revealed examples of animal abuse indicating that animals were inadequately protected by the [[Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act]] 1986. After a review by the government's chief inspector of animals ruled against BUAV's argument that the project licences should not have been granted, BUAV applied to the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] for a judicial review.&lt;ref name=BBCApril12&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/cambridgeshire/4436099.stm |title=Animal group's court review win |newspaper=BBC News |date=12 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The review ruled against BUAV on three of the four grounds, but on the remaining ground it found the [[Home Office]] had underestimated the suffering of the marmosets by categorising the experiments as "moderate," rather than "substantial." The Home Office announced a review of its procedures for categorising animal suffering.&lt;ref name=Randerson&gt;{{cite news|author=James Randerson|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2007/jul/28/animalrights |title=Government downplayed animal suffering in experiments|newspaper=The Guardian|date=28 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nature of the research==
[[Image:Marmoset.jpg|left|thumb|196px|A marmoset inside [[Cambridge University]], filmed by [[BUAV]].&lt;ref name=BUAVfilm&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buav.org/zerooption/video.html |title=BUAV film showing brain-damaged marmosets, filmed inside Cambridge University |access-date=24 February 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060308152443/http://www.buav.org/zerooption/video.html# |archive-date=8 March 2006 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
As of October 2002, [[Cambridge University]] had three project licences, issued by the [[Home Office]] under the [[Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986]], permitting the controlled use of one New World non-human primate species, the common marmoset, ''[[Callithrix jacchus]]''. The licence authorised the use of animals bred specifically for research use at breeding establishments in the UK in experiments to study brain function in relation to human disorders. According to the chief inspector of animals, the experimental protocols involved "the training and testing of animals using a range of behavioural and cognitive tasks; then disrupting normal brain function by chemical or physical lesions; the subsequent administration of experimental treatments intended to minimise the functional defects or repair the damage caused; and further testing to evaluate brain function." The animals were killed at the end of the experiments, most of them for tissue analysis.&lt;ref name=report13&gt;{{cite web |url= http://scienceandresearch.homeoffice.gov.uk/animal-research/publications-and-reference/publications/reports-and-reviews/chief_insp_animals_review.pdf |title= Aspects of non-human primate research at Cambridge University |access-date= 4 July 2009 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070707192159/http://scienceandresearch.homeoffice.gov.uk/animal-research/publications-and-reference/publications/reports-and-reviews/chief_insp_animals_review.pdf# |archive-date= 7 July 2007 |dead-url= yes |df= dmy-all }}, , review by the British government's chief inspector of animals, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists using marmosets at Cambridge have published their work in [[peer review]]ed journals. This includes discoveries relating to the role of the [[prefrontal cortex]] in behaviour,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dias R, Robbins TW, Roberts AC |title=Dissociation in prefrontal cortex of affective and attentional shifts |journal=Nature |volume=380 |issue=6569 |pages=69–72 |date=March 1996 |pmid=8598908 |doi=10.1038/380069a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Clarke HF, Dalley JW, Crofts HS, Robbins TW, Roberts AC |title=Cognitive inflexibility after prefrontal serotonin depletion |journal=Science |volume=304 |issue=5672 |pages=878–80 |date=May 2004 |pmid=15131308 |doi=10.1126/science.1094987|citeseerx=10.1.1.333.8219 }}&lt;/ref&gt; understanding [[learning]] and [[memory]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Barefoot HC, Baker HF, Ridley RM |title=Crossed unilateral lesions of temporal lobe structures and cholinergic cell bodies impair visual conditional and object discrimination learning in monkeys |journal=Eur.

==Allegations of cruelty==
[[Image:Marmoset2.jpg|right|frame|A marmoset inside [[Cambridge University]] after being brain damaged, filmed by [[BUAV]].]]
According to the British government's inspector of animals and the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection, in some experimental protocols, the monkeys were trained to perform certain [[Behavior|behavioural]] and [[cognitive]] tasks, then were made to repeat them after brain damage, to assess how the damage had affected their functioning.

For example, some of the monkeys suffered from a damaged arm after the experiments. They were then tethered in a way that forced them to use that arm to retrieve food or water. To encourage use of the limb, the monkeys were deprived of food or water for 22 out of every 24 hours for up to two and a half years.&lt;ref name=BUAVCU&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buav.org/undercover/cambridge.html|title=Cambridge University|publisher=[[British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607171257/http://www.buav.org/undercover/cambridge.html#|archive-date=7 June 2007|access-date=24 February 2006|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The monkeys were usually given an extra feed on Friday afternoons, but some researchers allegedly deprived the monkeys of this too, so that they could keep them hungry for further tests on the Monday.&lt;ref name=BUAVMind&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buav.org/zerooption/outofmind.html |title=Out of Mind |publisher=BUAV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During training for these tasks prior to brain surgery, BUAV claims that researchers were given instructions such as:
[[Image:BUAVCambridge2.jpg|left|thumb|200px|[[BUAV]] alleges that monkeys were left unattended for up to 15 hours after having parts of their brains removed to induce strokes, because [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]] staff worked nine to five.&lt;ref name=Laville&gt;{{cite news|last=Laville|first=Sandra |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,3604,1407818,00.html |title=Lab monkeys 'scream with fear' in tests|newspaper=The Guardian|date=8 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; ]]

* Chase monkey into test box
* Keep "miserable" or "angry" marmosets in test apparatus
* Bang on the shutter, bang on the window
* Punish bad habits such as grooming by making a loud bang every time he does something wrong
* Lower the shutter ... if necessary onto their fingers
* Use food restrictions to make the marmosets more amenable to "shaping"&lt;ref name=BUAVMind/&gt;

One effect of the brain damage was that the monkeys would engage in stereotypical rotating movements. BUAV reported that one test for Parkinson's disease involved shutting them in a small [[Perspex]] box for up to one hour at a time to see how often they would rotate, and injecting them with [[amphetamine]] to make them rotate faster. BUAV says the monkeys were often "clearly distressed and bewildered; they could be seen crying out, twisting frantically, retching or desperately trying to escape."&lt;ref name=BUAVCU/&gt;

BUAV also says their investigator discovered monkeys who had had the tops of their scalps sawn off to have strokes induced, and who were then left unattended for 15 hours overnight without veterinary attention, because Cambridge staff worked nine to five.&lt;ref name=Laville/&gt; Three full-time animal care staff were employed to look after 400 animals, according to a British government review, with the research scientists themselves responsible for the welfare of animals undergoing experimental procedures.{{sfn|Home Office|2002|p=24}}

A film produced by BUAV shows a monkey regaining muscle tone during surgery, an indication that the animal was insufficiently anaesthetised. The BUAV report suggested there was a delay of some minutes before more anaesthetic was given.{{sfn|Home Office|2002|p=56}}

===Response to the allegations===
The British government's chief inspector of animals conducted a review and published a report in October 2002. It concluded the veterinary input at Cambridge was "exemplary"; the facility "seems adequately staffed"; and the animals afforded "appropriate standards of accommodation and care."{{sfn|Home Office|2002|p=56}} The caging system was "no longer state of the art" but complied with Home Office provisions; and the marmoset colony was "generally healthy."{{sfn|Home Office|2002|p=6}}The inspector noted four instances of non-compliance with the licence: in two experiments, the surgical procedure was at variance with the project licence; on one occasion, the water restriction schedule was at variance; on one occasion, the licence holder did not inform the department that the severity limit of an experiment had been exceeded; there were minor technical irregularities on reports of how the animals were used.{{sfn|Home Office|2002|p=6}}

The reviewers consulted two experts in [[veterinary anaesthesia]] to investigate the consequences of a monkey regaining muscle tone during surgery. They advised that "unless purposeful or voluntary movements had accompanied the return of muscle tone then ... the anaesthetic agents should have been sufficient to block awareness of pain.{{sfn|Home Office|2002|p=57}}

Cambridge University welcomed the report as "confirmation that there was no evidence to support the allegations made by the BUAV."&lt;ref name=BBCApril12/&gt;

The BUAV was invited to give evidence to the inquiry, but declined. Nor did it make available the unedited video footage from its film. After publication of the report, the group said it was "utterly appalled and deeply angered by the Home Office's complete dismissal of overwhelming evidence of animal suffering" and that "the government's claim that it was correct to categorise as moderate suffering experiments where monkeys had the top of their skull sawn off and part of their brain sucked out is ludicrous in the extreme."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thew|first=Michelle|url=http://www.buav.org/zerooption/news/whitewash.html|title=Response by the BUAV to a review by the Chief Inspector into aspects of non-human primate research at Cambridge University|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704184921/http://www.buav.org/zerooption/news/whitewash.html#|archive-date=4 July 2007|access-date=24 February 2006|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judicial review==
As a result of the information obtained during their investigation and in light of the subsequent review, BUAV applied to the UK's [[High Court of Justice of England and Wales|High Court]] for permission to seek a [[judicial review]] of the legality of the Home Office's interpretation of the Cambridge case, and the wider implementation of vivisection legislation.&lt;ref name=Laville/&gt;

Mr Justice Burnton rejected four grounds for review directly related to the Cambridge case, but granted permission to seek judicial review on two wider grounds: whether death was an effect to be weighed in cost-benefit analysis and whether guidelines on restricting food and water should be a code of practice under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act.&lt;ref name=BBCApril12/&gt; At the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]], Lord Justice Keene allowed the review to proceed on two more counts that had originally been refused, on the grounds of public interest. These relate to the question of whether the Home Office underestimated the suffering of the Cambridge marmosets when setting severity limits and whether out-of-hours care and veterinary cover is required by law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buav.org/press/2005/CambridgeJRUpdate.html|title=Judicial review investigating cruelty to monkeys at Cambridge University given yet another legal boost|date=18 July 2005|publisher=British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607143832/http://www.buav.org/press/2005/CambridgeJRUpdate.html#|archive-date=7 June 2007|df=dmy-all|access-date=24 February 2006|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The 2007 review found in favour of the Home Office on three of the grounds. On the issue of suffering, the court found that the [[Home Secretary]] had unlawfully categorised the experiments as "moderate", rather than "substantial". The Home Office, given leave to appeal the decision, which it did successfully on April 2008 with the Home Office awarded costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper | title=Report of the Animal Procedures Committee for 2007 | publisher=TSO | publication-place=London | year=2008 | isbn=978-0-10-295801-0 | oclc=328800420|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/250778/1058.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Center for the Study of Democracy''' is a research and education institute at [[St. Mary's College of Maryland]] that focuses on the study of the history of emerging democracy in [[St. Mary's City, Maryland]], the site of Maryland'a first colonial capital and the location of many firsts in the development of democratic rights in North America; this work is done in conjunction with studies of modern democracies.  

The mission of the Center for the Study of Democracy is to draw historical lessons and also inspiration from history, in order to increase understanding of the processes and principles that lead to the constructive maintenance and enhancement of democracy in the United States and around the world. 

It does so by drawing on in-depth historical research, in conjunction with in-depth research on modern democracy-related issues and events, as they both relate to the process of [[democratization]] (establishing and improving democracy in all of its processes). 

The Center also sponsors numerous ongoing public forums and debates and seminars on these issues, many of which are covered by the media. 

The debates also often include hosting and moderating major political leaders or policy leaders facing off against their opponents.  

The Center for the Study of Democracy also strives to better understand historic setbacks and inconsistencies in the [[democratization]] process of historic Maryland and the United States, in order to better understand how these were eventually overcome; taking lessons from history that can then be applied to study of how democracy might be more constructively furthered today. The center Works in particular to increase understanding of how democracy may be enhanced in spite of the many obstacles that democratization often faces. 

The Center is jointly run by the Public Honors College, [[St. Mary's College of Maryland]] and its partner institution and neighbor, [[St. Mary's City, Maryland#Historic St. Mary's City|Historic St. Mary's City]], one of the nation's preeminent historical and archeological research institutions,

Commitments were also sought from [[Sierra Leone]]'s military government for quick elections and a return to democracy. While the country's foreign minister reiterated its intention to hold elections within three years the government did not commit to a date. The summit also agreed that global [[free trade]] was desirable and agreed to send a five country delegation to represent the Commonwealth at the current round of talks on the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]]. Finally, while the Commonwealth Secretariat had said that a goal of the summit would be the development of a declaration of a 'global humanitarian order', no agreement was reached on specifics of conflict resolution and human rights and a group was appointed instead to study the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Commonwealth heads end summit with statement on Cyprus|url=http://www.upi.com/Archives/1993/10/25/Commonwealth-heads-end-summit-with-statement-on-Cyprus/1417751521600/|accessdate=November 27, 2015|agency=United Press International|date=October 25, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Consumer Court'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ncdrc.nic.in/ | title=National Consumer Forum India }}&lt;/ref&gt; is the special purpose court, in [[India]], that deals with cases regarding consumer disputes and grievances. These are judiciary hearings set up by the government to protect the consumer rights. Its main function is to maintain the fair practices by the sellers towards consumers. Consumers can file a case against a seller if they are harassed or exploited by sellers. The court will only give a verdict in favour of the consumers/customers if they have proof of exploitation, i.e., bills or other documents. If a consumer does not have the proper documents required for filing a case then it would be very difficult for the consumer to win or even file a case.&lt;ref name="NCDRC Website"&gt;{{cite web|title=CONSUMER PROTECTION AND NATIONAL CONSUMER DISPUTES REDRESSAL COMMISSION|url=http://ncdrc.nic.in/|publisher=NCDRC|accessdate=18 December 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721172525/http://ncdrc.nic.in/|archivedate=21 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
# [[National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission|National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC)]]: A national level court works for the whole country and deals compensation claimed exceeds rupees one crore.

#[[District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum]] (DCDRF): A district level court works at the district level with cases where the compensation claimed is up to 20 lacks.&lt;ref name= "DCDRF, Raigad"&gt;{{cite web|title=DCDRF, Raigad|url=http://raigad.nic.in/htmldocs/District.html|accessdate=4 January 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090410032007/http://raigad.nic.in/htmldocs/District.html|archivedate=10 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Consumer movement ==
The consumer movement as a social force originated with the necessity of protecting and promoting the interests of consumers against unethical and unfair trade practices. Rampant food shortages, hoarding, [[black market]]ing, [[adulteration of food]] and [[edible oil]] gave birth to the consumer movement in an organized form in the 1960s.

The movement succeeded in bringing pressure. A major step was taken in 1986 by the [[Govt of India|Indian government]] with the enactment of the [[Consumer Protection Act of 1986]] (COPRA).&lt;ref name="NCDRC Website"/&gt;

== Objectives ==
The main function of consumer court is to provide some extra privilege to the consumers and to maintain fair practice by the seller or the service provider towards the consumer. Submitting complaint is very simple and a consumer has no need to hire any lawyer. Approaching a consumer court is very simple and extremely cheap as you can represent yourself without having to hire a lawyer and not required to pay any court fee but just a nominal fee.&lt;ref name=" NCDRC Website"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="775">The '''Convention of Limits (1926)''' was a convention signed between [[Portugal]] and [[Spain]], signed on 29 of June 1926, in [[Lisbon]].

Portugal and Spain signed an agreement demarcating the border from the confluence of Ribeira de Cuncos with the Guadiana, just south of [[Olivenza]], to the estuary of the [[Guadiana River]], on the far South. The border between Portugal and Spain from the confluence of the [[Caia (river)]] to the confluence of the [[Ribeira de Cuncos]] is not demarcated and remains so nowadays, with the [[Guadiana River]] being the de facto border.

The Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act 2014 (DRIPA) was repealed on 31 December 2016 and replaced by the [[Investigatory Powers Act 2016]].

==Synopsis==

The '''Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act 2014''' (also known as '''DRIP''' or '''DRIPA''') is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] that received [[Royal Assent#United Kingdom|Royal Assent]] on 17 July 2014, after being introduced on 14 July 2014.&lt;ref name=stages/&gt;&lt;ref name=legislation&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2014/27/pdfs/ukpga_20140027_en.pdf |publisher=[[The Stationery Office]] |title= Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act 2014 - Legislation PDF |accessdate=24 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the legislation is to allow security services to continue to have access to phone and internet records of individuals following a previous repeal of these rights by the [[Court of Justice of the European Union]].&lt;ref name=bbccommonspass&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-28305309 |publisher=[[BBC]] |title= Commons passes emergency data laws despite criticism |accessdate=24 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The act was criticised by some [[Members of Parliament#United Kingdom|Members of Parliament]] for the speed at which the act was passed through parliament,&lt;ref name=bbccommonspass/&gt; by some groups (such as the [[Open Rights Group]] and [[Liberty (advocacy group)|Liberty]]) as being an infringement of privacy.&lt;ref name=bbc10July&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-28237111 |publisher=[[BBC]] |title= Emergency phone and internet data laws to be passed |accessdate=24 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following legal action, in July 2015, the High Court issued an order that sections 1 and 2 of the Act were unlawful, and to be disapplied, suspended until 31 March 2016, thereby giving the government a deadline to come up with alternative legislation which is compatible with EU law.&lt;ref name=Judiciary2015-07-17&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/judgments/david-davis-and-others-v-secretary-of-state-for-the-home-department/|title=David Davis and others -v- Secretary of State for the Home Department|date=17 July 2015|publisher=judiciary.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=MPs win surveillance powers legal challenge|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-33564442|accessdate=8 November 2015|work=BBC|date=17 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2015|11|4}} an investigatory powers parliamentary bill was being drafted providing new surveillance powers, requiring records to be kept by Internet Service Providers tracking use of the internet from the UK, accessible by the police and security services without judicial oversight.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/04/theresa-may-surveillance-measures-edward-snowden The Guardian newspaper: Theresa May unveils surveillance measures in wake of Snowden claims, 4 November 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revocation==

On 1 August 2014, the [[Data Retention Regulations 2014]] came into force, completing the framework introduced by the DRIP. They provide that a communications service provider can be required to retain data only when target of a notice of the Secretary of State. In December 2014, in ''R (on the application of [[David Davis (British politician)|David Davis]] MP and [[Tom Watson (Labour politician)|Tom Watson]] MP) v Secretary of State for the Home Department'', Mr Justice Lewis (High Court) granted the Claimants permission to proceed to a substantive hearing, thus agreeing that the DRIP can be challenged by judicial review. As a reaction, the Government proposed using the [[Counter-Terrorism and Security Act 2015|Counter-Terrorism and Security Bill]] (CTSB) to extend their remit to cover data generated as a result of internet communications.

On 4 June 2015 a legal challenge against the law was brought to the High Court by two MPs, [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour's]] [[Tom Watson (Labour politician)|Tom Watson]] and the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[David Davis (British politician)|David Davis]]. They claimed that the act was rushed through parliament and was incompatible with the [[Human Rights Act 1998|Human Rights Act]] and the [[European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-33000160 |title=Emergency surveillance law faces legal challenge from 2 MPs |work=BBC News |date=4 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 July 2015 the High Court upheld the challenge, finding sections 1 and 2 of the Act to be unlawful.&lt;ref name=register2015-07-17&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/07/17/high_court_dripa_unlawful/|title=High Court smacks down 'emergency' UK spy bill as UNLAWFUL|date=17 July 2015|author= Alexander J Martin|work=The Register}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian2015-07-17&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/17/high-court-brake-snooping-european-law|title=Finally, the high court puts a brake on snooping on ordinary Britons |author=Carly Nyst|date=17 July 2015|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The court issued an order that sections 1 and 2 be disapplied, suspended until 31 March 2016, thereby giving the government a deadline to come up with alternative legislation which is compatible with EU law.&lt;ref name=Judiciary2015-07-17/&gt;

In October 2015, the Court of Appeal began hearing the Home Secretary's appeal against the ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Court of Appeal hears government surveillance law case|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-34607978|accessdate=8 November 2015|work=BBC|date=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 December 2016 the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled in joined cases that the Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act 2014 was unlawful [http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&amp;docid=186492&amp;pageIndex=0&amp;doclang=EN&amp;mode=lst&amp;dir=&amp;occ=first&amp;part=1&amp;cid=1949500 C203/15 and C698/15]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8284">'''Domain tasting''' is the practice of temporarily registering a domain under the five-day Add Grace Period at the beginning of the registration of an [[ICANN]]-regulated [[second-level domain]].&lt;ref name="Google leads"&gt;{{cite web|title=Google leads, ICANN follows: domain tasters can now eat dirt|url=https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2008/01/google-leads-icann-follows-domain-tasters-can-now-eat-dirt/|publisher=ICANN Wiki|date=30 January 2008|accessdate=11 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, a registration must be fully refunded by the [[domain name registry]] if cancelled. This was designed to address accidental registrations, but domain tasters use the Add Grace Period for other purposes.

==Overview==
In April 2006, out of 35 million registrations, about 2 million were permanent or actually purchased.  By February 2007, the [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of [[Go Daddy]] reported that of 55.1 million domain names registered, 51.5 million were canceled and refunded just before the 5 day grace period expired and only 3.6 million domain names were actually kept.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070707203924/http://www.bobparsons.com/WhyyoucantgetthedomainnameyouwantGoDaddyrescuesRegisterflycustomers.html Bob Parsons: Why it's getting harder to get the domain names you want]&lt;/ref&gt; ICANN's registry report for February 2007 shows that 55,794,877 .com and .net domain names were deleted in that month alone.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.icann.org/sites/default/files/mrr/com/com-operator-200702-en.pdf Verisign monthly registry operator report, February 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

Domain tasting is lucrative in a number of ways:
# The registrant conducts a [[cost-benefit analysis]] on the viability of deriving income from potential [[Internet marketing|advertising]] on the domain's [[website]]. Domain names that are deemed potentially lucrative and retained in a registrant's portfolio often represent domains that were previously used and have since expired, misspellings of other popular sites, or generic terms that may receive [[type-in traffic]]. 
# Domains are usually still active in [[web search engine|search engine]]s and other [[hyperlink]]s and therefore receive enough traffic such that advertising revenue exceeds the cost of the registration.

==Anti-domain tasting measures==

In January 2008, [[ICANN]] proposed several possible solutions, including the elimination of the exemption on transaction costs (US$ 0.20) during the five-day [[grace period]], which would effectively make the practice of domain tasting not viable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icann.org/minutes/prelim-report-23jan08.htm Preliminary Report for the Special Meeting of the ICANN Board of Directors]. ICANN, 28 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The ICANN operating plan and budget for Fiscal Year 2009 included a section intended to deal with the problem of Domain tasting. Now the transaction fee of $0.20 is applied to domains deleted in the Add Grace Period where the number of such domains exceeds 10% of the net new registrations or 50 domains, whichever is greater. The "net new registrations" here is defined as the number of new registrations minus the number of domains deleted in the Add Grace Period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AGP (Add Grace Period) Limits Policy|url=http://www.icann.org/en/resources/registries/agp/agp-policy-17dec08-en.htm|publisher=ICANN|accessdate=16 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Google said in 2008 that their [[AdSense]] program would now look for domain names that are repeatedly registered and dropped. These domains will automatically be dropped from the AdSense program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Google cracks down on "domain tasters"|url=http://www.pcpro.co.uk/news/160158/google-cracks-down-on-domain-tasters|publisher=PC Pro|accessdate=16 October 2012|author=Simon Aughton|date=28 Jan 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in April 2009, many [[top level domain]]s (TLDs) began transitioning from the $0.20 fee for excess domains deleted to implementing a policy resulting in a fee equal to registering the domain.&lt;ref name="tastingfee"&gt;{{cite web

In August 2009, ICANN reported that prior to implementing excess domain deletion charges, the peak month for domain tastings was over 15 million domain names. After the $0.20 fee was implemented, tastings dropped to around 2 million domain names per month. As a result of the further increase in charges for excess domain deletions, implemented starting April 2009, the number of domain tastings dropped to below 60 thousand per month.&lt;ref name="tastingfee"/&gt; However, these statistics only represent reports from the generic TLDs; ICANN does not set policy for the country code TLDs ([[ccTLD]]).

==Related practices==

===Reverse domain tasting===
A number of registrars routinely change a domain's name servers to those of their own, or a parking service, when a domain has gone past its expiration or renewal date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The End of Domain Tasting {{!}} AGP Deletes Decrease 99.7% | url=http://www.icann.org/en/news/announcements/announcement-12aug09-en.htm|publisher=ICANN | accessdate=16 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Domains continue to resolve for up to 30 days or more after their registration and redemption grace period have expired. The advantage of this "reverse tasting" is that the registrars or parking services can determine which domains have traffic before they are deleted, and hence maintain a list of domains that they might re-register (or even transfer) after the deletion date, as part of [[Domain sniping|drop catch]] services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The End of Domain Tasting {{!}} AGP Deletes Decrease 99.7%|url=http://www.domainstate.com/industry-news-6/reverse-domain-tasting-in-uk-100736.html | author=devolution | publisher=Domain State|date=20 June 2009 | accessdate=11 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Domain kiting===
Domain tasting should not be confused with '''domain kiting''', which is the process of deleting a domain name during the five-day grace period and immediately re-registering it for another five-day period. This process is repeated any number of times with the end result of having the domain registered without having to pay for it.

===Domain name front running===
In January 2008, [[Network Solutions]] was accused of this practice when the company began reserving all domain names searched on their website for five days,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.domainnamenews.com/featured/domain-registrar-network-solutions-front-running-on-whois-searches/1359 Domain Registrar Network Solutions Front Running On Whois Searches]&lt;/ref&gt; a practice known as [[domain name front running]].

===Domain tasting used for spam===
Domain tasting has been used for the purposes of spam.&lt;ref&gt;http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2009/08/15/guest-blog-aftertaste-domain-tasting-era-quietened-whisper/&lt;/ref&gt; The limited lifetime of the tasted domain allows the spammer to effectively send spam using a disposable domain name.

'''''Epperson v. Arkansas''''', 393 U.S. 97 (1968), was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case that invalidated an [[Arkansas]] statute that prohibited the teaching of [[human evolution]] in the public schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Epperson v. Arkansas|link=|volume=393|page=97|pin=|year=1968}}. {{usgovpd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Court held that the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution]] prohibits a state from requiring, in the words of the majority opinion, "that teaching and learning must be tailored to the principles or prohibitions of any religious sect or dogma." The Supreme Court declared the Arkansas statute unconstitutional because it violated the [[Establishment Clause of the First Amendment]].  After this decision, some jurisdictions passed laws that required the teaching of [[creation science]] alongside evolution when evolution was taught.  These were also ruled unconstitutional by the Court in the 1987 case ''[[Edwards v. Aguillard]]''.&lt;ref name=Edwards&gt;{{ussc|name=Edwards v. Aguillard|link=|volume=482|page=578 |pin=|year=1987}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Background ==
This case focused on the constitutionality of a 1928 Arkansas statute prohibiting the teaching of human evolutionary theory in its public schools and universities. The statute was enacted during a period of [[Christian Fundamentalist]] religious fervor in the 1920s. The Arkansas statute was modeled after Tennessee's 1925 "[[Butler Act]]", the subject of the well known [[Scopes Trial]] in 1925. The [[Tennessee Supreme Court]] upheld the [[constitutionality]] of the Tennessee law in 1927, allowing the state to continue to prohibit the teaching of evolution.

The Arkansas law was passed through the [[initiative|initiative process]], the first anti-evolution law in the United States passed through general election, and teachers who violated it were made subject to fine and dismissal by the state.  The law made it, &lt;blockquote&gt;unlawful for any teacher or other instructor in any university, college, normal, public school or other institution of the state which is supported in whole or in part from public funds derived by state or local taxation to teach the theory or doctrine that mankind ascended or descended from a lower order of animals, and also that it be unlawful for any teacher, textbook commission, or other authority exercising the power to select textbooks for above-mentioned institutions to adopt or use in any such institution a textbook that teaches the doctrine or theory that mankind ascended or descended from a lower order of animal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Separation of Church and State in the United States |publisher=Univ Of Minnesota Press; Minnesota Archive Editions edition |isbn=978-0-8166-5965-4 |author=Alvin W. Johnson, Frank H. Yost }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The case in ''Epperson v. Arkansas'' involved the teaching of biology in a [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]] high school forty years later. Based upon the recommendation of the school biology teachers, the administrators adopted a new [[textbook]] for the 1965-1966 school year which contained a chapter discussing [[Charles Darwin]] and evolutionary theory, and prescribed the subject be taught to the students.

Susan Epperson was a teacher in the Little Rock school system, employed to teach 10th grade [[biology]] at the [[Little Rock Central High School]].  The adoption of the new textbook and curriculum standard put her in a legal dilemma because it remained a criminal offense to teach the material in her state, and to do as her school district instructed would also put her at risk of dismissal.  Epperson was not opposed to the teaching, and with backing from the Arkansas chapter of the [[National Education Association]] and the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], and the unequivocal support of the [[Little Rock Ministerial Association]], filed suit to test the federal constitutionality of the Arkansas state law.  She filed in the [[Arkansas State Chancery Court|Chancery Court]] in [[Pulaski County, Arkansas|Pulaski County]] seeking nullification of the law and an injunction against her being dismissed for teaching the evolutionary curriculum. She was joined in the suit by H. H. Blanchard, a parent with children in the school.&lt;ref name="nelkin"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Nelkin |first=Dorothy |title=The Creation Controversy: Science or Scripture in Schools |publisher=iUniverse |location=New York |year=2000 |pages= 242 |isbn=0-595-00194-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=larson/&gt;

The Chancery Court held that the statute violated the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] to the United States Constitution which protects citizens from state interference with freedom of speech and thought as contained in the constitution's [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]. The lower court decided the law was unconstitutional because it "tends to hinder the quest for knowledge, restrict the freedom to learn, and restrain the freedom to teach."&lt;ref&gt;''Epperson'', 393 U.S. at 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, the [[Arkansas Supreme Court]] reversed the lower court ruling.  The opinion read:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Upon the principal issue, that of constitutionality, the court holds that Initiated Measure No. 1 of 1928, Ark.Stat.Ann. § 81627 and § 81628 (Repl.1960), is a valid exercise of the state's power to specify the curriculum in its public schools. The court expresses no opinion on the question whether the Act prohibits any explanation of the theory of evolution or merely prohibits teaching that the theory is true, the answer not being necessary to a decision in the case and the issue not having been raised.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This decision left the ban against teaching evolution in effect.&lt;ref name=larson&gt;{{cite book |last=Larson |first=Edward John |edition=3, revised |title=Trial and error: the American controversy over creation and evolution |publisher= Oxford University Press US |isbn=9780195154702 |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decision==
Epperson appealed the State Supreme Court's reversal to the United States Supreme Court.  Eugene R. Warren presented arguments for the appellant, Epperson, and Don Langston, an [[Arkansas Attorney General|Assistant Attorney General]] for Arkansas, argued on behalf of the state of Arkansas.  Both Langston and the State Appeal Court focused on the power given to states to set curriculum standards, and did not delve far into the subject of evolutionary theory itself nor to the boundaries between church and state.&lt;ref&gt;''See:''
* Text of Arkansas Supreme Court decision quoted in US Supreme Court Justice Fortas' opinion, [https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0393_0097_ZO.html#393_US_97n7 footnote 7], "Upon the principal issue, that of constitutionality, the court holds that Initiated Measure No. 1 of 1928...is a valid exercise of the state's power to specify the curriculum in its public schools. The court expresses no opinion on the question whether the Act prohibits any explanation of the theory of evolution or merely prohibits teaching that the theory is true; the answer not being necessary to a decision in the case, and the issue not having been raised."
* US Supreme Court Justice Harlan concluded the brevity of the opinion signaled a deliberate attempt to sidestep the controversy between evolution and religion. {{cite book |last=Larson |first=Edward John |edition=3, revised |title=Trial and error: the American controversy over creation and evolution |publisher=Oxford University Press US |isbn=9780195154702 |year=2003}}, p 108&lt;/ref&gt;
 U.S. Supreme Court found the reasons given in the Arkansas reversal were in error.  They went on to say the clear purpose of the Arkansas statute against the teaching of evolution was to protect a particular religious view, and was thus unconstitutional.  In a decision written by Justice [[Abe Fortas]], the Court held, &lt;blockquote&gt;The overriding fact is that Arkansas’ law selects from the body of knowledge a particular segment which it proscribes for the sole reason that it is deemed to conflict with a particular religious doctrine; that is, with a particular interpretation of the Book of Genesis by a particular religious group.&lt;ref name=addicott&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/lawjournal/issues/volume63/number6/addicott.pdf |title=Storm Clouds on the Horizon of Darwinism |first=Jeffrey F. |last=Addicott |journal=Ohio State Law Journal |volume=63 |issue=6 |pages=1507 |year=2002 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Court found that not only was the state prohibited from advancing or protecting a particular religious view, but that, &lt;blockquote&gt;[T]he state has no legitimate interest in protecting any or all religions from views distasteful to them.&lt;ref name=addicott/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Justice [[Hugo Black]] issued a separate opinion to overturn the Arkansas law, finding the law unconstitutionally "vague" rather than an unconstitutional religious infringement.  While agreeing with the majority to reverse the State Appeal Court decision, his opinion details his dissent from the majority over the First Amendment issue.&lt;ref name=larson/&gt;

===the Directly and Sharply test===

Outside of its impact on separation of church and state issues, Epperson v. Arkansas is the origin of the "directly and sharply" test for when Courts may intervene in the daily operations of school systems.

[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15294019960718746276 Courts do not and cannot intervene in the resolution of conflicts which arise in the daily operation of school systems and which do not directly and sharply implicate basic constitutional values. On the other hand, the vigilant protection of constitutional freedoms is nowhere more vital than in the community of American schools.]

The "directly and sharply" test is often used to dismiss USC 1983 cases brought by parents claiming civil rights violations by school districts.

==Consequences==
Though [[William Jennings Bryan]] famously testified to some questions about [[Genesis creation narrative|Biblical creation]] in the 1925 ''[[Scopes trial|Scopes v. State]]'' trial, that Court, like this one, was asked only to judge whether or not teachings about human evolution could be prohibited in the public schools.  Even in that case Bryan, who opposed the evolution instruction, never argued that the teaching of Biblical creation belonged in the school.  

The precedent set in ''Epperson'', in which the Court concluded the sole motive behind the ban against evolution teaching in Arkansas was to protect a particular religious view, effectively nullified all other related evolution education prohibitions throughout the United States. Within a short time of the ''Epperson'' decision, religious opponents of the teaching attempted through other means to lessen its influence in the curriculum, including requiring schools to teach biblical creation alongside evolution or forcing schools to provide disclaimers that evolution was "only a theory".  These attempts eventually resulted in precedent-setting court decisions, and ultimately ''[[Edwards v. Aguillard]]'', which struck down a Louisiana statute as unconstitutional.&lt;ref name=Edwards/&gt;

'''Essential services''' may refer to a class of [[vocation|occupations]] that have been [[legislation|legislated]] by a government to have special restrictions in regard to [[Labor activism|labour actions]], such as not being allowed to legally [[strike action|strike]].

The [[International Labour Office]], a United Nations agency, makes distinctions between an essential service and a minimum service.&lt;ref name="Freedom of association, Fifth (revised) edition, 2006"&gt;[http://www.ilo.org/global/standards/information-resources-and-publications/publications/WCMS_090632/lang--en/index.htm International Labour Organization], Freedom of association - Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee of the Governing Body of the ILO. Fifth (revised) edition, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

:582. What is meant by essential services in the strict sense of the term depends to a large extent on the particular circumstances prevailing in a country. Moreover, this concept is not absolute, in the sense that a non-essential service may become essential if a strike lasts beyond a certain time or extends beyond a certain scope, thus endangering the life, personal [[safety]] or [[health]] of the whole or part of the population.
:
:585. The following may be considered to be essential services:
:* the [[hospital]] sector
:* [[electricity]] services
:* [[water supply]] services
:* [[Local telephone service|telephone service]]s
:* [[police]] and the [[armed forces]]
:* [[firefighting]] services
:* [[prison|public]] or [[private prison]] services
:* the provision of food to pupils of [[school]] age and the cleaning of schools
:* [[air traffic control]]
:
:587. The following do not constitute essential services in the strict sense of the term:
:* [[radio]] and [[television]]
:* the [[petroleum]] sector
:* [[Port (ship)|ports]]
:* [[banking]]
:* [[Computer services|computer service]]s for the collection of [[excise tax|excises]], [[Duty (economics)|duties]] and [[tax]]es
:* [[department store]]s and pleasure [[park]]s
:* the metal and [[mining]] sectors
:* [[transportation|transport]] generally
:* [[airline pilot]]s
:* production, transport and distribution of fuel
:* [[railway]] services
:* metropolitan transport
:* [[postal services]]
:* [[garbage collection|refuse collection]] services
:* [[refrigeration]] enterprises
:* [[hotel]] services
:* [[automobile]] manufacturing
:* [[agriculture|agricultural]] activities, the supply and distribution of [[foodstuffs]]
:* the [[Minting coins|minting of money]]
:* [[Paramedic]]s and [[ambulance]]s
:* the government printing service and the state [[Drinking alcohol|alcohol]], salt, and [[tobacco]] [[monopoly|monopolies]]
:* the [[education]] sector
:* [[mineral water]] [[Water bottling|bottling]] company

While maintaining a right to strike, the ILO recognizes situations and conditions under which a minimum operational service could be required.

:606. The establishment of minimum services in the case of strike action should only be possible in: (1) services the interruption of which would endanger the life,
: personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population (essential services in the strict sense of the term); (2) services which are not essential in the strict
: sense of the term but where the extent and duration of a strike might be such as to result in an acute [[national emergency|national crisis]] endangering normal [[living conditions]] 
: of the population; and (3) in [[public service]]s of fundamental importance.

Examples where the ILO considered conditions met for a minimum operational service include a [[ferry]] service, ports, [[Rapid transit|underground railway]], transportation of passengers and [[commerce|commercial goods]], postal services, refuse collection service, the mint, banking services, petroleum sector services, education services, and [[animal health]] services.

'''''Federal Communications Commission v. Pacifica Foundation''''', 438 U.S. 726 (1978), is a [[landmark decision|landmark]] [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] decision that defined the power of the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) over [[decency|indecent]] material as applied to broadcasting.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=FCC v. Pacifica Foundation|volume=438|page=726|pin=|year=1978}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Facts ==
In 1973, a father complained to the FCC that his son had heard the [[George Carlin]] routine "[[Seven dirty words|Filthy Words]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/filthywords.html |title=George Carlin, Filthy Words |website=Exploring Constitutional Conflicts |quote=The following is a verbatim transcript of "Filthy Words" (the George Carlin monologue at issue in the Supreme Court case of FCC v. Pacifica Foundation) prepared by the Federal Communications Commission... |accessdate=December 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; broadcast one afternoon over [[WBAI]], a [[Pacifica Foundation]] [[FM broadcasting|FM radio]] station in New York City. Pacifica received censure from the FCC, in the form of a letter of reprimand, for allegedly violating FCC regulations which prohibited broadcasting indecent material.

[[File:Seven Dirty Words WBAI.jpg|thumbnail|left|In reference to this case, a poster in a [[WBAI]] broadcast booth warns radio broadcasters against using the [[seven dirty words]].]]

== Holding ==
The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the FCC's actions in 1978, by a vote of 5 to 4, ruling that the routine was "indecent but not [[obscenity|obscene]]". The Court recognized the government had strong interests in:
* Shielding children from potentially offensive material, and
* Ensuring that unwanted speech does not intrude on the privacy of one's home.

The ''Pacifica'' Court upheld the FCC’s power to regulate broadcast media, citing two pervading governmental interests. First, the “uniquely pervasive” nature of these broadcasts allows them to seep into “the privacy of the home” without the consent of the viewer. Second, broadcasts are “uniquely accessible to children” whose “vocabulary [could be enlarged] in an instant” by hearing indecent or profane language. The Court held that these two concerns were sufficient to “justify special treatment of indecent broadcasting,” thereby allowing the FCC to fine broadcasters for airing inappropriate content.

The Court stated that the FCC had the authority to prohibit such broadcasts during hours when children were likely to be among the audience, and gave the FCC broad leeway to determine what constituted indecency in different contexts.

== Impact ==
At first, despite the resounding win in ''Pacifica'', the FCC used its new regulatory powers sparingly.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander J. Lindvall, ''Frankly, My Dear, I Don't Give a *Darn*—An Argument Against Censoring Broadcast Media'', 7 [[Arizona_State_Sports_and_Entertainment_Law_Journal|Ariz. St. Sports &amp; Ent. L.J.]] 153, 170 (2017).&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s, however, the FCC ramped up sanctions for indecent broadcasts as conservative groups and the Reagan Administration expressed concern over the rise of “shock jock” radio personalities.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander J. Lindvall, ''Frankly, My Dear, I Don't Give a *Darn*—An Argument Against Censoring Broadcast Media'', 7 [[Arizona_State_Sports_and_Entertainment_Law_Journal|Ariz. St. Sports &amp; Ent. L.J.]] 153, 170 (2017).&lt;/ref&gt; And by the early 2000s, the FCC began to levy more sanctions with higher dollar amounts—with fines of up to $500,000 for some offenses.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander J. Lindvall, ''Frankly, My Dear, I Don't Give a *Darn*—An Argument Against Censoring Broadcast Media'', 7 [[Arizona_State_Sports_and_Entertainment_Law_Journal|Ariz. St. Sports &amp; Ent. L.J.]] 153, 171 (2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, Pacifica Radio "Living Room" host Larry Bensky prefaced an interview with Carlin by saying: "George Carlin, you're a very unusual guest for Pacifica Radio. You're probably the only person in the United States that we don't have to give The Carlin Warning to about which words you can't say on this program, because it's named after you."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Bensky | first = Larry | title = Living Room : Interview With Comedian George Carlin | publisher = Pacifica Radio Archives | date =  4 June 1997 | url =  http://www.pacificaradioarchives.org/recording/pz031546 | accessdate = 18 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =  Bensky | first = Larry | title = PZ0624b Radical Comedians Box Set DISC TWO | publisher = Pacifica Radio Archives | date =  4 June 1997 | url =  https://archive.org/details/Pz0624bRadicalComediansBoxSetDiscTwo | accessdate = 18 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, Congress passed the [[Communications Decency Act]], which criminalized the knowing transmission of "obscene or indecent" messages to underage people. In ''[[Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union]]'' (1997), the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] claimed that the act violated First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of speech. To attain standing, the ACLU published the Supreme Court's opinion on ''F.C.C. v. Pacifica Foundation'' on its website, which included a transcript of Carlin's monologue.

At least one scholar has argued that modern self-censoring technology—''e.g.'', the [[V-chip]]—has significantly undermined the Supreme Court's rationale in ''Pacifica''.&lt;ref&gt; Alexander J. Lindvall, ''Frankly, My Dear, I Don't Give a *Darn*—An Argument Against Censoring Broadcast Media'', 7 [[Arizona_State_Sports_and_Entertainment_Law_Journal|Ariz. St. Sports &amp; Ent. L.J.]] 153 (2017) (available [http://asuselj.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Lindvall-Final.pdf here]).&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''United States Arbitration Act''' ({{USStatute|68|401|43|883|1925|2|12}}, codified at {{Usc-title-chap|9|1}}), more commonly referred to as the '''Federal Arbitration Act''' or '''FAA''', is an [[act of Congress]] that provides for judicial facilitation of private dispute resolution through [[arbitration]]. It applies in both state courts and federal courts, as was held constitutional in ''[[Southland Corp. v. Keating]]''. It applies where the transaction contemplated by the parties "involves" interstate commerce and is predicated on an exercise of the [[Commerce Clause]] powers granted to Congress in the U.S. Constitution.

The FAA provides for contractually based compulsory and binding arbitration, resulting in an ''[[arbitration award]]'' entered by an arbitrator or arbitration panel as opposed to a ''[[Judgment (law)|judgment]]'' entered by a court of law. In an arbitration, the parties give up the right to an appeal on substantive grounds to a [[court of law|court]].

Once an award is entered by an arbitrator or arbitration panel, it must be "confirmed" in a court of law; and once confirmed, the award is reduced to an enforceable judgment, which may be enforced by the winning party in court, like any other judgment. Under the FAA, an award must be confirmed within one year, and any objection to an award must be challenged by the losing party within three months. An arbitration agreement may be entered "prospectively" (ie., in advance of any actual dispute), or may be entered into by the disputing parties once a dispute has arisen.

==Legal challenges==

The Supreme Court ruled in ''[[Hall Street Associates, L.L.C. v. Mattel, Inc.]]'' that the grounds for judicial review specified in the FAA may not be expanded, even if the parties to the arbitration agreement agree to allow expanded review of the decision.

On June 20, 2013, the Court ruled in ''[[American Express Co. v. Italian Colors Restaurant]]'' that [[class action]] waivers contained in mandatory [[arbitration clause]]s were valid even if plaintiffs prove that it would not be economically practicable to maintain these actions individually.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotusblog.com/2013/06/details-american-express-v-italian-colors-restaurant/ Mike Gottlieb, Details: American Express v. Italian Colors Restaurant, SCOTUSblog (June 20, 2013).]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-133_19m1.pdf American Express v. Italian Colors Restaurant, No. 12-133 (June 20, 2013).]&lt;/ref&gt;

In its decision on ''[[Epic Systems Corp. v. Lewis]]'' on May 21, 2018, the Supreme Court ruled that the FAA is not overridden by the [[Protected concerted activity|protection of concerned activity]] established by the [[National Labor Relations Act of 1935]], effectively making individual arbitration agreements in contracts wholly enforceable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/supreme-court-rules-that-companies-can-force-workers-into-individual-arbitration/2018/05/21/09a3a968-5cfa-11e8-a4a4-c070ef53f315_story.html | title = Supreme Court rules that companies can require workers to accept individual arbitration | first =Robert |last =Barnes | date = May 21, 2018 | accessdate = May 21, 2018 | work = [[The Washington Post]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Partial preemption of state law==
Section 2 of the FAA declares that arbitration provisions will be subject to invalidation only for the same grounds applicable to contractual provisions generally, such as unconscionability or duress. Consequently, most state law that disfavors the enforcement of arbitration agreements will be [[Federal preemption|preempted]] by the FAA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New York Arbitration|url=http://eguides.cmslegal.com/pdf/arbitration_volume_I/CMS%20GtA_Vol%20I_NEW%20YORK.pdf|publisher=CMS Legal|accessdate=21 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; State laws that govern the procedures of arbitration, but do not affect its enforcement, are outside the Act's preemptive scope.

Not all state laws regarding arbitration are preempted, for example:
*NASD rule 12204 of 1992 (now FINRA Rule 2268), which allows investor class actions to proceed in federal court nullifies arbitration agreements when class certification is sought, is not preempted.&lt;ref name=L1&gt;{{cite book|last=Fields|first=Michael S|title=FORMS (California forms of pleading and practice)|pages=Chapter 32 - Contractual Arbitration}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*California H&amp;SC 1363.1 is partially preempted.&lt;ref name=L1/&gt;

However, a recent [[Financial Industry Regulatory Authority]] (FINRA) Office of Hearing Officers (OHO) decision in a disciplinary action against Charles Schwab &amp; Co. questions the ability of a regulator to enforce arbitration agreement restrictions such as NASD Rule 12204 (FINRA Rule 2268).&lt;ref&gt;FINRA Disciplinary Proceeding No. 2011029760201&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finra.org/Newsroom/NewsReleases/2013/P209249 FINRA Hearing Panel Dismisses Two of Three Causes of Action in Complaint Against Charles Schwab &amp; Company]&lt;/ref&gt; The dispute arose when Charles Schwab &amp; Co. revised its pre-dispute arbitration agreement to preclude a customer from participating in a class action against the firm, effectively removing the ability for a customer to have a claim heard in court. FINRA rules require arbitration through a FINRA arbitration panel, except in the case of class actions, which are reserved for the court system.

Specifically, the OHO Panel cited the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decision in ''[[Shearson/American Express Inc. v. McMahon]]'' that securities law claims are no exception to the FAA's mandate that parties to an otherwise valid arbitration agreement submit the claim to arbitration.&lt;ref&gt;Shearson/American Express Inc. v. McMahon, 482 U.S. 220 (1987)&lt;/ref&gt; The OHO Panel also applied the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decision in ''[[AT&amp;T Mobility v. Concepcion]]'' where the Court established that class actions also are not an exception to the FAA, stating that a party to an arbitration agreement has no right to participate in a class action instead of an arbitration on an individual basis and that an exception to the FAA's mandate requires clear expression of Congressional intent. FINRA has appealed the OHO decision to the National Adjudicatory Council.&lt;ref&gt;FINRA to Appeal Ruling on Schwab Class-action Ban - Wall Street Journal, Feb. 26, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

A case-by-case analysis is required to determine whether a specific California law is preempted. In general where the FAA has no procedural provisions applicable in state court, there is no preemption.&lt;ref name=L1/&gt;

A number of [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] cases have dealt with the preemption of state laws by the Federal Arbitration Act:
*''[[Southland Corp. v. Keating]]'', 465 U.S. 1 (1984) - Established the applicability of the FAA to contracts under state law.
*''[[Perry v. Thomas]]'', 482 U.S. 483 (1987)
*''[[Shearson/American Express Inc. v. McMahon]]'', 482 U.S. 220 (1987)
*''[[Volt Info. Sciences, Inc.. v. Stanford Univ.]]'', 489 U.S. 468 (1989)
*''[[Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos. v. Dobson]]'', 513 U.S. 265 (1995)
*''[[Mastrobuono v. Shearson Lehman Hutton, Inc.]]'', 514 U.S. 52 (1995)
*''[[Doctor's Assocs., Inc. v. Casarotto]]'', 517 U.S. 681 (1996)
*''[[Buckeye Check Cashing Inc. v. Cardegna]]'', 546 U.S. 440 (2006) - Arbitrators must first hear challenge to legality of contract.
*''[[Preston v. Ferrer]]'', 128 S.Ct. 978 (2008) - Act requires arbitration first even when state law provides for administrative dispute resolution
*''[[AT&amp;T Mobility v. Concepcion]]'',  no. 09-893, 563 U.S. (2011) - Despite California state law and lower court rulings that contracts barring class actions are unconscionable, the Court ruled 5-4 that consumers are bound by that aspect of [[arbitration clause]]s.
*''[[Nitro-Lift Technologies v. Howard]]'', no. 11-1377 (Nov. 26, 2012) - the issue of whether an agreement is valid as a matter of applicable state law is one for the arbitrator, not for the state courts.

The firm was involved in Boston's early civil rights struggle and the [[Boston busing crisis]] when it represented the plaintiffs in a 1970s lawsuit that brought [[desegregation]] to Boston Public Schools.&lt;ref name="wbur"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wbur.org/2012/03/30/boston-busing-crisis|title=40 Years Later, Boston Looks Back On Busing Crisis &amp;#124; WBUR|publisher=wbur.org|accessdate=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This legal victory resulted in the firm establishing the Foley Hoag Foundation,&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Vault Guide to Law Firm Diversity Programs|author1=Vault (Firm)|author2=Djordjevich, V.|date=2006|publisher=Vault.com|isbn=9781581314403|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0JdKrPC-f6kC|page=466|accessdate=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which focuses on improving [[race relations]] in Boston.&lt;ref name="foleyhoag"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foleyhoag.com/thefirm/thefoleyhoagfoundation.aspx |title=Foley Hoag Foundation &amp;#124; Foley Hoag |publisher=foleyhoag.com |accessdate=16 April 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130101070459/http://www.foleyhoag.com/TheFirm/TheFoleyHoagFoundation.aspx |archivedate=1 January 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foley Hoag is also involved in the Boston-area [[entrepreneurial]] community, providing counsel local technology [[Startup company|startup]] companies. In 2002, the firm moved its main office to its current location in the Seaport District in [[South Boston]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2002_May_28/ai_86375438 Prestigious Boston Law Firm Relocates to Seaport District; Foley Hoag Paves the Way to Waterfront; Becomes Anchor Tenant at New World Trade Center West].

'''Garnishment''' is an [[United States|American]] legal process for collecting a monetary [[Judgment (law)|judgment]] on behalf of a [[plaintiff]] from a [[defendant]]. Garnishment allows the plaintiff (the "garnishor") to take the money or property of the debtor from the person or institution that holds that property (the "garnishee").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is a Garnishment|url=http://jec.unm.edu/manuals-resources/court-brochures/judgment-collection.doc|website=Judicial Education Center|publisher=University of New Mexico|accessdate=30 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar legal mechanism called [[Writ of execution|execution]] allows the seizure of money or property held directly by the debtor.

Some jurisdictions may allow for garnishment by a tax agency without the need to first obtain a judgment or other court order.&lt;ref&gt;In the context of U.S. federal tax law, see {{usc|26|6331}}. See also ''United States v. Rodgers'', 461 U.S. 677, 103 S. Ct. 2132, 83-1 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) paragr. 9374 (1983) (''dicta'').&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wages==
'''Wage garnishment''', the most common type of garnishment, is the process of deducting money from an employee's monetary compensation (including [[salary]]), usually as a result of a [[court order]]. Wage garnishments may continue until the entire debt is paid or arrangements are made to pay off the debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wage Garnishment in Ohio|url=https://www.communitylegalaid.org/node/22/wage-garnishment-ohio|website=Community Legal Aid|publisher=Community Legal Aid Services, Inc|accessdate=11 October 2017|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garnishments can be taken for any type of debt but common examples of debt that result in garnishments include:
* [[Child support]]
* Defaulted [[Student loans in the United States|student loans]]
* [[Tax]]es
* Unpaid [[Court costs]]

When served on an [[employer]], garnishments are taken as part of the [[payroll]] process. When processing payroll, sometimes there is not enough money in the employee's [[net pay]] to satisfy all of the garnishments. For example, in a case with federal tax, local tax, and credit card garnishments, the first garnishment taken would be the federal tax garnishments, then local tax garnishments, and, finally, garnishments for the credit card. Employers receive a notice telling them to withhold a certain amount of their employee's wages for payment and cannot refuse to garnish wages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Wage Garnishment |url=http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2003/pdf/03-31489.pdf |publisher = U.S. Government Publishing Office |work= [[Federal Register]] | volume= 68 |issue = 246 |date=2003-12-23 |accessdate=2009-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Employers must correctly calculate the amount to withhold, and must make the deductions until the garnishment expires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Garnishments: A Trap for Employers  |url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/garnishments-trap-employers |publisher=Varnum, LLP|work= The National Law Review|date= December 17, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Wage garnishment can negatively affect credit, reputation, and the ability to receive a loan or open a bank account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Mara Yoresh and Daniel Rivera |title=Playing the System- The Consumer's Guide to Credit Repair |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tIRspPpPbOsC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;dq=%2B%22wage+garnishment%22+%2B%22credit+score%22 |page=16 |publisher=MD Corp |year=2007 |accessdate=2009-06-15 |ISBN=1-4348-2302-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At present four [[U.S. states]]—[[Pennsylvania]], [[North Carolina]], [[South Carolina]], and [[Texas]]—do not allow wage garnishment at all except for tax-related debt, child support, federally guaranteed student loans, and court-ordered fines or restitution. The federal garnishment limit (with some exceptions like child support and student loans) on a weekly basis is the lower of (A) 25% of one's disposable earnings (what's left after mandatory [[tax deductions]]), or (B) the total amount by which one's weekly wage exceeds thirty times the [[minimum wage in the United States|federal hourly minimum wage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=What Does it Mean to be Judgment-Proof|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/consumer-protection/what-does-it-mean-be-judgment-proof|website=ExpertLaw.com|accessdate=19 March 2018|date=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several other states observe maximum thresholds that are lower than the maxima provided by federal law. States may also prohibit garnishment altogether in certain circumstances. For example, in [[Florida]] the wages of a person who provides more than half the support for a child or other dependent are exempt from garnishment altogether (though this is subject to [[waiver]]). Loans and negotiations with creditors can also help debtors to avoid wage garnishment.

In Minnesota, there are five limits on wage garnishment: Creditors cannot garnish wages for social security benefits, retirement benefits, welfare payments, workers' compensation benefits, or income associated with disability or unemployment insurance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Garnishment|url=https://www.ag.state.mn.us/consumer/publications/Garnishment.asp|website=Minnesota Attorney General|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many states when the person is an employee or appointee of a governmental unit the writ is called a Writ of [[Sequestration (law)|Sequestration]]. These are processed by the courts in the same manner as garnishments and are subject to the same wage exemptions.

In the United States, firing an employee to avoid handling a levy may be a criminal offense. Federal law provides for a fine of up to $1,000 and imprisonment for up to one year on an employer who willfully fires an employee in connection with a garnishment of the employee's earnings.&lt;ref&gt;See {{usc|15|1674}}; see also, Internal Revenue Manual, IRM 5.11.5.2 (rev. Jan. 1, 2006), Internal Revenue Service, U.S. Department of the Treasury.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Attachments ==
The other type of garnishment, also known as ''attachment'' (or [[attachment of earnings]]),  requires the garnishee to deliver all the defendant's money and/or property in the hands of the garnishee at the time of service of process to the court, to be paid over to the plaintiff. Since this type of garnishment is not continuing in nature, but is not subject to the type of restrictions that apply to wage garnishment, it is most often used against banks, or other persons or companies that incur liquidated obligations in the regular course of business. The garnishment should not begin during the pay period but instead on the following pay period

=== Federal taxes ===
Under U.S. federal tax law, a garnishment by the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) is a form of [[Tax levies|administrative levy]]. In the case of an IRS levy, no court order is required.&lt;ref&gt;See {{usc|26|6331}}; ''United States v. Rodgers'', 461 U.S. 677, 103 S. Ct. 2132, 83-1 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) paragr. 9374 (1983) (''dicta''); ''Brian v. Gugin'', 853 F. Supp. 358, 94-1 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) paragr. 50,278 (D. Idaho 1994), ''aff’d'', 95-1 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH)  paragr. 50,067 (9th Cir. 1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

Only a few requirements must be met before the IRS starts a wage garnishment:
* The IRS must have assessed the tax and must have sent a written Notice and Demand for Payment;
* The [[taxpayer]] must have neglected or refused to pay the tax within the time prescribed in the notice; and,
* The IRS must have sent a Final Notice of Intent to Levy and Notice of Your Right to A Hearing (levy notice) at least 30 days before the levy.

The IRS may serve the Final Notice in person, may leave the notice at the taxpayer’s home or usual place of business, or may send it to the last known address by certified or registered mail. The IRS is required to send the Final Notice to the last address known to the agency. The taxpayer does not need to actually receive the notice for the notice to be effective. Many taxpayers never actually receive the final notice. Those taxpayers may not realize they are in danger of receiving a levy until their wages are actually garnished.

'''Infectious invalidity''' is a doctrine of [[property law]] that provides that under certain defined circumstances because one action is improper another action is invalid.&lt;ref Name="Bobrowski"&gt;{{cite book

This approach was taken in the [[Massachusetts]] case of ''New England Trust Co. v. Sanger'', 337 Mass. 342, 149 N.E.2d 598 (1958).

The Restatement (2d) of Property, which is a treatise describing general legal principles applied by the courts in the United States states that 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Infectious invalidity means that the failure of certain transfers may cause interests that are otherwise valid to fail also. This approach was taken in [[New England]] Trust Co. v. Sanger, 337 Mass. 342, 149 N.E.2d 598 (1958). A trust provided for income to be paid to the surviving children of the settlor's brother for life, and on the death of the last surviving child of the settlor's brother, an equal division of the trust principle was to be made among the issue of the children of the settlor's brother. The gift to the issue of the brother's [[children]] failed, because the ascertainment of issue could not be made until the brother's children died, and the brother might have children born after the creation of the trust who might not die within the permissible period. However, a later trust had been established by the settlor, which stated that if any provision in the first trust indenture should be declared invalid, any income or [[principal sum|principal]] which reverted to his estate should be deemed held in trust by the settlor for the benefit of his brother's children and their issue. Applying the doctrine of infectious invalidity to avoid a distortion of the settlor's "clear desire," the court held that the second trust should govern the trust distribution. It stated that by striking down all the gifts, valid and invalid, made in the first trust, and by giving effect to the second trust, the settlor's plan for the income gifts was substantially carried out. [§ 1.5 comment 7] &lt;/blockquote&gt;

In [[zoning law]], infectious invalidity is a principle where a parcel of land that itself complies with zoning requirements is considered to be in violation of zoning laws because of the circumstances of its creation.  The situation arises when a parcel of land is improperly divided into two lots, resulting in one of the new lot conforming to the applicable zoning standards and one lot not conforming. The legal principle is applied resulting in the conforming lot being deemed to be infected because of the illegal condition created on the other lot and the creation of the two lots is deemed invalid. Infectious invalidity affects both zoning and property ownership rights.

'''Inspector''' is both a [[police]] rank and an administrative position, both used in a [[number]] of contexts. However, it is not an [[Logical equivalence|equivalent]] rank in each [[police]] force.

== Australia ==
In Australian [[police forces]], the rank of Inspector is generally the next senior rank from [[Sergeant|Senior Sergeant]] and is less senior than a [[Superintendent (police)|superintendent]] (in the cases of the [[Queensland Police]] and [[Western Australia Police]]) in the other [[Australian Federal Police|Australian police force]]s. Members holding the rank usually wear an epaulette featuring three silver pips, the same rank badge as a [[Captain (land and air)|Captain]] in the [[Australian Army|army]].
In addition to the general rank of Inspector, some [[police]] forces use other ranks such as Detective Inspector and District Inspector.

== Austria ==
In Austria a similar scheme was used as in Germany. At some point the police inspector was completely removed from the list of service ranks. The current police service has an inspectors service track with "Inspektor" being the entry level – it is followed by "Revierinspektor" (precinct inspector), "Gruppeninspektor" (group inspector), "Bezirksinspektor" (district  inspector), "Abteilungsinspektor" (section inspector), "Kontrollinspektor" (control inspector) and "Chefinspektor" (chief inspector).

== Canada ==
In most [[Policing in Canada|Canadian police services]] the rank of inspector is the first above the [[staff sergeant]] rank. It is usually immediately below the rank of [[superintendent (police)|superintendent]]. Senior inspectors are a high administrative rank in Canada's police forces and are considered to be the first level of senior management.

===Staff Inspector===
Provincial Police Services and the majority of Municipal Police Services, such as the [[Toronto Police Service]] have a '''staff inspector''' rank, which ranks above inspector and below superintendent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Toronto Police Service |url=http://www.torontopolice.on.ca/rank/ |title=Toronto Police Service :: To Serve and Protect |publisher=Torontopolice.on.ca |date= |accessdate=2017-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vancouver.ca/police/recruiting/police-officers/policing.html#Advancement |title=The Job &amp;#124; Vancouver Police Department |publisher=Vancouver.ca |date= |accessdate=2017-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edmontonpolice.ca//~/media/EPS%20External/Files/Reports/2008AnnualReport.ashx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611015615/http://www.edmontonpolice.ca/~/media/EPS%20External/Files/Reports/2008AnnualReport.ashx |archivedate=2010-06-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other commonwealth police agencies and some American police departments, such as the [[Philadelphia Police Department]] also have staff inspectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phila.gov/personnel/specs/6A08.htm|title=ranks|publisher=phila.gov|accessdate=13 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== France ==
In the [[French National Police]], inspecteur is a former rank of members of the Command and Management Corps. There were several grades of ''Inspecteur'', with senior detectives holding the various grades of [[Commissaire de police|commissaire]]. See [[French National Police]] for current ranks. In the [[Directorate-General of Customs and Indirect Taxes|French customs]], inspecteur is the first rank of members of the Command and Management Corps.

== Germany ==
In contemporary [[Germany]], "Inspektor" is a civil service rank. It is the lowest and therefore the entry rank of the ''gehobener Dienst'' (upper service) requiring a degree from a three-year administrative college. The rank is not used in the German police services; there the equivalent of Inspektor is Kommissar. In earlier times the upper service track was called "Inspektorenlaufbahn" (inspectors service track) ranging from "Inspektor", "Oberinspektor" (senior inspector), "[[Amtmann]]", "Amtsrat" to "Oberamtsrat" (senior supervisor).

The title is used on many professional areas that require an inspection service, like "Brandinspektor" (fire inspector in the fire department), "Steuerinspektor" (tax inspector in the financial department) or "Bauinspektor" (building inspector in building control) that are in a supervision position of their department. In many administration parts a corresponding position exists like the "Regierungsinspektor" (government inspector on the federal level), "Stadtinspektor"/"Stadtverwaltungsinspektor" (city administration inspector), "Kreisinspektor"/"Kreisverwaltungsinspektor" (county administration inspector) that serve in supervision of the department.

In some regions the "Inspektor" is a colloquial name for any police officer  just like in Austria.

== Hong Kong ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:S-GOVT-HKPF-INS-CIP.gif|thumb|Chief Inspector insignia of [[Hong Kong Police Force]]]] --&gt;
In the [[Hong Kong Police Force]], inspector (including probationary inspector and senior inspector) is the rank senior to [[station sergeant]] but junior to [[chief inspector]], leading a sub-unit in day-to-day policing. Rank badge of probationary inspector is one silver pip on his/her epaulette; 2 silver pips for inspector of police; and 2 silver pips and one bar on for senior inspector of police. The epaulettes rank badge of [[chief inspector]] is 3 silver pips. The epaulettes of all inspectors do not show their personal identification number. Plain-clothes detective inspectors have the prefix "detective" identifying them as having been trained in criminal investigation and being part of Criminal Investigation Department (CID) or Organised Crime Triad Bureau (OCTB).

Several of the HKP's past and current Commissioner of Chiefs joined the force as Probationary Inspector ranks as opposed to the junior ranks.

[[Customs and Excise Department (Hong Kong)|Customs and Excise Department]] also have inspector ranking but with bronze stars and bars rank badge instead.

In addition, there are Health Inspectors from the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department who carry out investigation and prosecution on sanitary nuisance and irregularities of food business under related ordinances. They are characterised by golden stars and yellow rank badge.

== Indonesia ==
In the [[Indonesian National Police]], there are four levels of inspector, which are First Police Inspector (''Inspektur Polisi Satu''), Senior Police Inspector (''Inspektur Polisi Dua''), First Police Inspector [[Adjutant]] (''Ajun Inspektur Polisi Satu''), and Second Police Inspector Adjutant (''Ajun Inspektur Polisi Dua''). Those ranks are below the rank of Police Commissioner Adjutant (''Ajun Komisaris Polisi'') and above the rank of Chief Police Brigadier (''Brigadir Polisi Kepala'').

== India ==
{{Main|List of police ranks in India}}
Inspectors of Police in India are typically the officer in charge at a police station. In a police station in India, there are Constables, the Head Constables, Sub Inspector and The Inspector. They have the three-star insignia to indicate their position and they are high command officers.
Inspector's post is higher than sub inspector's post whose post is higher than assistant sub inspector's post.

== Ireland ==
In the ''[[Garda Síochána]]'', inspectors are senior to sergeants and junior to [[Superintendent (police)|superintendents]]. Inspectors may be either detectives or in uniform.

== Italy ==
In the ''[[Polizia di Stato]]'', the position of ''Ispettore'' (Inspector) replaced the rank of ''[[Marshal (Italy)|Maresciallo]]'' after the 1981 reorganization and [[demilitarization]] of the corps; an ''Ispettore'' is thus a [[Sergeant]] of several sorts, above the rank of ''Sovrintendente'' ([[Superintendent (police)|Superintendent]], which is somewhat equal to a [[Corporal|Senior Corporal]]) and under the rank of ''[[Police commissioner|Commissario]]''. There are three four different Inspector ranks in the [[Polizia di Stato]]: ''Vice Ispettore'' ("Assistant Inspector"), ''Ispettore'' ("Inspector"), ''Ispettore Capo'' ("[[Chief Inspector]]") and ''Ispettore Superiore'' ("Special Inspector", or "Superior Inspector"), roughly equivalent to the ranks ranging from [[Junior Sergeant]] to [[Second Lieutenant]]. A fifth position, called ''Ispettore Superiore S.U.P.S.'', where the achronym stands for ''Sostituto Ufficiale di Pubblica Sicurezza'' ("Special Inspector – Substitute Public Safety Commissioned Officer"), is used to designate those Inspectors which can act as substitutes to [[Police commissioner|Commissioners]] in the [[command hierarchy|chain of command]] under certain situations, or in Police detachments that are too small to require the presence of a Commissioner; when this happens, the officer is named ''Ispettore Superiore – Sostituto Commissario'' ("Special Inspector – Substitute Commissioner"). Inspectors can serve either in uniformed patrol duties, plain-clothed patrol duties, or as detectives. The Inspector ranks are the highest that an Italian Police officer can reach without having a [[University degree]].

== Malaysia ==
In the [[Royal Malaysia Police]], the rank of Inspector is one level above Sub-Inspector and one level below Assistant Superintendent. There are two stages: probation inspector (probation lasts within three years) and inspector. Inspectors are recruited differently from normal police constables, requiring at least a degree, and their training is longer.

== Nepal ==
In [[Nepal Police]], the rank of Inspector is generally the next senior rank from Sub Inspector (SI) and is less senior than a Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP). Members holding the rank usually wear an epaulette featuring one pair of crossed [[kukri]], the same rank badge as a Inspector in [[Armed Police Force (Nepal)]].

== Papua New Guinea ==
In the [[Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary]], the rank of Inspector is one level above [[Chief Sergeant]] and below [[Senior Inspector]]. Officer Cadets normally graduate and automatically become an Inspector.

==Philippines==
In the [[Philippines]], inspector is a [[List of Ranks in the Fire, Police, and Jail Services of the Philippines|rank]] in the [[Philippine National Police]], the [[Bureau of Jail Management and Penology]], and the [[Bureau of Fire Protection]].  It is above the senior officer 4 (sergeant) and below the senior inspector (captain).  It is regarded as an equivalent of a lieutenant in the Army.

== Poland ==
In [[Poland]], inspector (''inspektor'') is a high rank (above ''podinspektor'' and ''młodszy inspektor'', but below ''nadinspektor''), comparable to [[colonel]] of the armed forces.

== Romania ==
In the [[Romanian Police]], inspector is a rank senior to ''[[Sub-inspector#Romania|Subinspector]]'' and junior to ''[[Chief Inspector|Inspector principal]]'' and corresponds to the former rank of Police [[Lieutenant]] (''see [[Romanian Police#Ranks|Romanian Police Ranks]]'').

== Singapore ==
In the [[Singapore Police Force]], there are several ranks that have the title of Inspector in it.

In the junior police officer category, there is the rank of 'Station Inspector', 'Senior Station Inspector' and 'Senior Station Inspector (2)'. The title of 'Inspector' is in the senior police officer category. For National Servicemen, outstanding policemen may be appointed as a 'National Service Probationary Inspector'.

In the [[National Police Cadet Corps]], the rank of Probationary Inspector is given to officer cadet trainees who have successfully completed their Officers' Basic Training Course or Honorary Officers' Basic Training Course. Probationary Inspectors who pass their probationary period will then attain the rank of Inspector. The rank insignia of Probationary Inspector and Inspector is two pips, with the letters 'NPCC' below it, so as to differentiate NPCC Inspectors from Singapore Police Force personnel. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npcc.org.sg/roa.html|title=National Police Cadet Corps|website=www.npcc.org.sg|language=en|access-date=2018-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Spain ==
In [[Spain]], the rank of Inspector exists in the National Police Force&lt;ref&gt;Official Web of Spanish National Police Force [http://www.policia.es/cnp/cnp.html Policia.es], Cuerpo Nacional de Policía.&lt;/ref&gt; of Spain ([[:es:Inspector de policía (España)|''Cuerpo Nacional de Policía'']]), the [[Mossos d'Esquadra| Catalan Police Force]], and several municipal police forces.

== Sri Lanka ==
In the [[Sri Lanka Police Service]], Inspector of Police (IP) is senior to ''[[Sub-inspector#Sri Lanka|Sub-Inspector]]'' and junior to ''[[Chief Inspector]]''. In many towns, Inspectors would be the [[Officer in charge (police)|Officer in Charge]] (OIC) at most [[police station]]s. The rank insignia for a Police Inspector is two stars.

In addition to the Police, the term Inspector is used in other government departments for posts such as ''Chief Inspector of Excise'', ''Inspector of Excise'', ''Chief Inspector of Customs'', ''Inspector of Customs'', ''Co-operative Inspector'', ''Fisheries Inspector'', [[Public Health Inspector (Sri Lanka)|Public Health Inspector]].

== United Kingdom ==
[[File:Inspector Epaulette.svg|UK police inspector epaulette|thumb|100px|right]]
{{See also|Police ranks of the United Kingdom}}
Within the [[Law enforcement in the United Kingdom|British police]], inspector is the second supervisory [[Police ranks of the United Kingdom|rank]]. It is senior to that of [[Sergeant#United Kingdom|sergeant]], but junior to that of [[Chief Inspector#United Kingdom|chief inspector]]. The rank is mostly operational, meaning that inspectors are directly concerned with day-to-day policing. Uniformed inspectors are often responsible for supervising a duty shift made up of constables and sergeants, or act in specialist roles such as supervising [[Road Policing Unit|road traffic policing]].

The rank of inspector has existed since the foundation of the [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]], [[Metropolitan Police Act 1829|formed in 1829]], when it was used to designate the rank immediately below that of [[Superintendent (police)|superintendent]], and many [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] police forces also use the term.

Plain-clothes detective inspectors are equal in rank to their uniformed counterparts, the prefix "detective" identifying them as having been trained in criminal investigation and being part of or attached to their force's [[Criminal Investigation Department]] (CID).

The [[epaulette]]s of uniformed inspectors, unlike those of constables and sergeants, do not show a [[Police division|divisional]] or [[Collar number|personal identification number]]. Instead they feature [[Order of the Bath]] stars, informally known as "pips", being the same insignia as those of a [[lieutenant]] in the [[British Army]].

Newly promoted inspectors currently receive a salary of £48,690 (£50,823 London) (2016 payscale) rising to £50,061 (£52,200 London).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.policeoracle.com/pay_and_conditions/police_pay_scales.html Policeoracle.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Metropolitan Police, the rank was formerly officially known as Station Inspector to distinguish it from the more senior rank of [[Sub-Divisional Inspector]] (abolished in 1949). A Station Inspector wore a single star on his epaulettes until 1936, when this changed to a star over two bars to accommodate the new rank of [[Junior Station Inspector]] (wearing a star over one bar).&lt;ref&gt;"New Police Badges", ''The Times'', 27 June 1936&lt;/ref&gt;

== United States ==
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Captain]] --&gt;
In the United States, the term inspector can have very different meanings depending on the law enforcement agency.

=== Municipal police ===
{{See also|Police ranks of the United States}}

An inspector in a US municipal police department is more likely to be a senior executive officer, analogous to a [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] police [[Superintendent (police)|superintendent]] or [[chief superintendent]]. It may also be a title held by a supervisor of detectives.

In the [[New York City Police Department]], a deputy inspector is one grade above captain and an inspector is another grade higher, wearing the insignia of a military colonel. in the [[Philadelphia Police Department]], a staff inspector is a grade above captain and an inspector is another grade higher, with the insignia of a lieutenant colonel. An inspector is also two grades above a captain in the [[Baltimore Police Department]], [[Nassau County Police Department]] and [[Suffolk County Police Department]].

Inspector is more rarely used as a rank that is one grade above [[Police captain|captain]], such as in the [[Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia]]. This is equivalent to a major or [[Commander#United States police rank|commander]] in other departments. The [[Los Angeles Police Department]] formerly had a rank of inspector for this purpose. It was changed to commander in 1974, because LAPD senior officers preferred the more [[military]]-sounding title.

In the police departments of [[Hayward, California|Hayward]], [[California]], [[Oklahoma City]] and formerly in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], [[California]], inspector is the rank held by a senior detective.

In the [[San Francisco Police Department]], inspector was the normal title for a detective. Unlike detectives in most other departments, inspectors in San Francisco always had supervisory duties. The investigative branch of the SFPD was called the Bureau of Inspectors, since renamed the Investigations Bureau.

=== State police ===
In the [[Wisconsin State Patrol]], and others, inspectors are state troopers assigned to the motor carrier safety inspection unit where they enforce trucking laws and regulations.

The North Carolina Department of Transportation's Division of Motor Vehicles License and Theft Bureau uses the title of inspector for its sworn state law enforcement agents/investigators. The inspectors of this agency investigate motor vehicle theft, title and odometer frauds, state issued identification and driver's license frauds, as well as regulate and inspect motor vehicle dealerships, repair shops, tow and storage facilities, and emissions and safety inspection centers. The NC DMV License and Theft Bureau is the state's oldest law enforcement agency and was formed in 1921 to combat vehicle theft with the rising sales of Ford's Model T. The agency has kept the title designation of inspector for traditional purposes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncdot.org/dmv/other_services/licensetheft/about.html Ncdot.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Oregon Liquor Control Commission]] uses the title of inspector for sworn law enforcement agents who investigate violations of the Liquor Control Act and other related crimes.

=== Federal agencies ===
In the [[Federal Bureau of Investigations]] (FBI), an inspector is a [[special agent]] whose main duty is inspecting local field offices and resident agencies to make sure they are operating efficiently. Since FBI inspectors are not tied to any particular field office, they have, in the past, also been used as trouble-shooting investigators on major cases. [[Joseph Sullivan (FBI)|Joseph Sullivan]] was perhaps the best-known of the Bureau's Major Case Inspectors and served as the model for Inspector Lew Erskine, the fictional character played by [[Efrem Zimbalist Jr.]] in the 1965–1974 [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] TV series ''[[The F.B.I. (TV series)|The FBI]]''.  [[Samuel P. Cowley]] was an FBI inspector in the late 1920s and 1930s who assisted in bringing down notorious gangsters such as [[John Dillinger]] in the early 1930s, before his death in November 1934 in a gun battle with [[Baby Face Nelson]].

The [[United States Marshals Service]] and the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] employ similar positions, but they primarily serve as internal affairs investigators.
The [[United States Park Police]] changed the rank of Inspector to the rank of Major, which is between captain and deputy chief.
In the [[Postal Inspection Service]], inspector is the name given to 1811 [[General Schedule (US civil service pay scale)|job series]] criminal investigators, better known as [[special agents]] in most other federal law enforcement agencies.

Prior to 2003, the US Customs Service (USCS) and the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) had uniformed, law enforcement employees called Customs Inspectors and Immigration Inspectors.  These employees inspected and processed people and merchandise entering the United States from  foreign countries, at a land border, seaport or airport.  They wore different types of uniforms and had different duties, but were paid essentially the same.  After US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) was established with the merging of the above two agencies, the inspectors were retitled Customs and Border Protection Officers and merged their responsibilities.

=== Administrative law ===
In American [[administrative law]], an inspector is an official charged with the duty to issue permits, such as a [[building code|building inspector]] or [[sanitation]] inspector, and to enforce the relevant [[regulations]] and [[laws]]. These positions are commonly known as the Fire Inspector or Building Inspector.  The duty it act is based on the adopted building or fire code in the municipality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://inspector911.com/what-is-an-inspector/363 Inspector911.com]&lt;/ref&gt; A government agency may also have an [[Inspector General]] responsible for preventing internal [[fraud]], waste, abuse and other agency deficiencies.

==In popular culture==
In fiction, "Inspector" is often used as a term and title for a [[detective]], even if their duties and role does not match that of an inspector in a Commonwealth police force. Examples of fictional inspectors include the characters of [[Inspector Clouseau]], [[Inspector Gadget]], [[Inspector Javert]], [[Inspector Morse]] and the title character of ''[[An Inspector Calls]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6786">The '''International Sporting Code''' (ISC) is a set of rules which are valid for all [[auto racing]] events that are governed by the [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile]] (FIA).  [[North America]]n domestic racing, such as [[NASCAR]] and [[IndyCar]] are outside the FIA's jurisdiction and hence not governed by the ISC. [[Motorcycle sport]] is also exempt since the [[Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme]] (FIM) is responsible for this sport, not the FIA.

The ISC consists of 17 chapters and several [[Addendum#Books|appendices]]. It contains definitions, general principles, and regulations, as well as rules for race organizers, contenders, racers, and official [[referee]]s. As the sport of motor racing is very [[hierarchy|hierarchic]], the ISC also determines the rules of national racing federations.

==Summary==

The ISC consists of 17 chapters. In the first chapter it is determined that the FIA is the sole international sporting authority entitled to make and enforce regulations regarding automobile competitions. It is further determined that the ISC is a regulation to encourage and facilitate international motor sport. Each national autosport club or federation affiliated with the FIA is allowed to draw up their own rules. The ISC will not be enforced, as long competition is safe and fair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=International Sporting Code|year=2013|publisher=Fédération International de l'Automobile|page=Chapter I|url=http://argent.fia.com/web/fia-public.nsf/C57D2C7837004DC3C125734B0032A5A2/$FILE/CSI%2024.10.2006%20modif%20ap%20AGO%20oct%2006%20revu%2016.05.07ANG.pdf?Openelement}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With regard to records the ISC differentiates between international records and local records. Local records established on a permanent or temporary track fall within the scope of the national federation of that country. [[International Sporting Code#Appendix D|Appendix D]] applies to international records.

===Kinds of racing===
This chapter features articles about what kind of vehicles exist and what kind of motor sport competitions exist.

* [[Race track|Circuit race]]
An event held on a closed circuit between two or more vehicles, running at the same time on the same course, in which speed or the distance covered in a given time is the determining factor.

* [[Dragracing|Drag race]]
An acceleration contest between two vehicles racing from a standing start over a straight, precisely measured course in which the first vehicle to cross the finish line (without penalty) achieves the better performance

* [[Hillclimbing|Hill Climb]]
An event in which each vehicle takes the start individually to cover the same course ending with a finish line situated at a higher altitude than the start line. The time 
taken to cover the distance between the start and finish lines is the determining factor for establishing the classifications.

* [[Rally racing|Rally]]
Road event with an imposed average speed, which is run entirely or partly on roads open to normal traffic. A rally consists either of a single itinerary which must be followed by all cars, or of several itineraries converging on a same rallying-point fixed beforehand and followed or not by a common itinerary.

* [[Rally raid|Cross-Country Rally]] and Baja Cross-Country Rallies
The length of each selective section must be no more than 500&amp;nbsp;km and the total length of the event must be at least 800&amp;nbsp;km.

* Marathon Cross-Country Rallies 
The total course must be at least 10,000&amp;nbsp;km and the distance of the legs is free. The total duration may not exceed 31 days, including [[scrutineering]] and [[prologue]]. Only cars in Groups T ([[Group T1|T1]], [[Group T2|T2]], [[Group T3|T3]], [[Group T4|T4]]) may be admitted.

===Further regulations===
The ISC further regulates what kind of officials exist, penalties when a breach of rules appears and how to protest and appeal.

==Notable appendices==

===Appendix D&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Appendix D - Regulations For Land Speed Record Attempts|year=2013|publisher=Fédération International de l'Automobile|url=http://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/basicpage/file/Appendix%20D_3.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; ===
Appendix D of the ISC further regulates attempts at [[land speed records]]. In accordance to the appendix, world records can only be set in four categories:
* Category A: special automobiles built for land speed record attempts
* Category B: series production automobiles (like the [[Bugatti Veyron]])
* Category VII: [[solar car racing|solar powered]] vehicles (like the [[UNSW Sunswift]])
* Category XI: [[hybrid power]]ed vehicles (like the [[Buckeye Bullet]])
* Category C: special vehicles with any kind of engine and the use of aerodynamic aid is allowed (like the [[ThrustSSC]])
* Category D: [[Dragracing|drag race]] cars

Each category could be further subdivided in groups according to [[engine type]].
The appendix also features different types of records e.a. acceleration records, distance records (flying start) or distance records (standing start).

===Appendix J===
Appendix J was introduced by the FIA in 1954, initially for Touring Cars and GT Cars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/regulation/file/2014_Appendix%20K_WEB%20%28140108%29.pdf ''Appendix K to the International Sporting Code'', www.fia.com] Retrieved on 1 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt; It regulates what kind of cars race in what classes and what the specifications are. Currently Appendix J features three categories and fifteen groups:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Appendix J|year=2013|publisher=Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile|url=http://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/regulation/file/251%20%282013%29.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Category I: Series production cars
** [[Group N]]: Production cars
** [[Group A]]: Touring cars
** [[Group R]]: Touring cars or large scale series production cars 
** [[Group T1]]
** [[Group T2]]
* Category II: Competition cars
** [[Group R|Group RGT]]: GT production cars
** [[Group GT1]]: Grand Touring cars
** [[Group GT2]]: Grand Touring cars
** [[Group GT3]]: Cup Grand Touring cars
** [[Group CN]]: Production sports cars
** [[Group D (FIA)|Group D]]: International [[formula racing]] cars
** [[Group E (FIA)|Group E]]: Free formula racing cars
** [[Group T3]]
* Category III: Trucks
** [[Group F (FIA)|Group F]]: Racing trucks

'''Jenkins Law Library''' is a membership library, located in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], serving the local legal community.

==History==

'''The Law Library Company of the City of Philadelphia''' ([[United States|America]]'s first [[law library]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jenkinslaw.org/files/firstlawlib-philalaw.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;) was founded in 1802 by 71 attorneys, among whom were the most prominent lawyers of the time. They formed a corporation so they could jointly purchase a collection of legal materials with which to practice law. Shares of stock in the company were sold for $20; annual dues were $2.

In 1827, the Law Library Company merged with the Associated Members of the Bar and became known as the Law Association of Philadelphia. Eventually this organization became known as the ''Philadelphia Bar Association'', and in 1931 the library's name was changed (the first of several name changes) to the Law Library of the Philadelphia Bar Association.

The [[law library|library]] was operated by the [[Bar association|Bar Association]] until July 1, 1967, when the Theodore F. Jenkins Memorial Law Library (now known as Jenkins Law Library) was established with court approval to carry out the provisions of the will of the late Madeleine Hart Jenkins. It was her wish that her late husband, Theodore Finley Jenkins, be memorialized in a manner that would benefit the Bar and the public.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jenkinslaw.org/files/history.ppt&lt;/ref&gt;

Governed by a [[Board of Directors]], Jenkins Law Library is a [[501(c)(3)]]. Although now independent from the Philadelphia Bar Association, the two organizations work together on mutual projects that benefit members of the [[Philadelphia]] legal community.

When it came time to renovate the Jenkins Law Library in 2004, Executive Director Regina Smith had one thought in mind – make the library a destination for lawyers, not a book warehouse.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jenkinslaw.org/files/renovation-aall.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jenkinslaw.org/files/renovation-bar.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jordanian citizenship''' is the status of being a citizen of the Hashemite Kingdom of [[Jordan]] and it can be obtained by [[jus sanguinis|birth]] or [[naturalisation]].

The '''Jordanian nationality''' is transmitted by [[Paternity (law)|paternity]] (father) (see [[Jus sanguinis]]). Therefore, a Jordanian man who holds Jordanian citizenship can automatically confer citizenship to his children and foreign wives. Under the current law, descendants of Jordanian [[emigration|emigrants]] can only receive citizenship from their father as women cannot pass on citizenship to their children or foreign spouses. Since 2010, there has been an increasing public demand for giving the opportunity for Jordanian women to transmit their Jordanian nationality to their children and also to their husbands.

In recent years, Jordan, the only Arab country with a significant population of assimilated Palestinian refugees that provides citizenship, has been found to be unexpectedly stripping Jordanian citizenship from citizens of Palestinian origin, leading to growing concerns and amplifying the national debate over the [[Palestinians in Jordan|Palestinian presence in Jordan]] and the [[Palestinian right of return]] in relation to the preservation of [[Palestinian territories]] from Israeli forces.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016|reason=the claim isn't backed by any source that Palestinians are being stripped of their citizenship}}

==Rights and responsibilities of Jordanian citizens==

===Rights of citizens===
Citizens of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan by law have the legal right to:

*Live freely in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan without any [[immigration]] requirements
*Gain access to free education covering primary, and secondary education. University education is not free.
*Receive all health-care benefits at any public health institution
*Participate in the Jordanian political system
*Benefit from the privileges of the free trade market agreements between the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and many Arab countries
*Get exempted from taxes with no condition of reciprocity
*Own and Inherit property and values in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan
*Enter to and exit from the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan through any port
*Travel to and from other countries in accordance with [[visa (document)|visa]] requirements
*Seek consular assistance and protection abroad by the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan through Jordanian embassies and consulates abroad and ithers

===Responsibilities of citizens===
In a state of necessity, all Jordanian citizens are required, when prescribed by the law of the Jordanian government, to bear arms on behalf of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, to perform noncombatant service in the [[Jordanian Armed Forces]], and to perform work of national importance under civilian direction.

Under the supervision of an official authority, a person convicted by a court of law may be required to do any work or to render any service provided that the person is not hired to or placed at the disposal of any persons, companies, societies or public bodies.

==The code==
The code covering the Jordanian nationality was issued on 1 January 1954 as the Jordanian Nationality Law of 1954 and was last amended in 1987.

==Dual nationality==
According to the Jordanian government, there have been no restrictions on [[multiple citizenship]] in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan since its 1954 law on Jordanian nationality. Thus, foreigners who acquire Jordanian citizenship and Jordanian citizens who voluntarily acquire another citizenship keep their previous citizenship (subject to the laws of the other country).

==Acquisition of Jordanian citizenship==

===''Jus sanguinis''===
A child is Jordanian at birth if:
*Either or both parents are Jordanian citizens.
*The child is the offspring of an unmarried mother (irrespective of her citizenship), but the [[Paternity (law)|paternity]] of the child, despite there being no marriage, has been established/declared to belong to a man of Jordanian citizenship.

===Naturalization===
As per law No. 6 of 1954 on Nationality (last amended 1987).

Article 4: 
Any Arab who has resided continuously in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan for not less than 15 years may acquire Jordanian nationality, by decision of the Council of Ministers taken on a proposal by the Minister of Internal Affairs, if he renounces his nationality of origin and the law of his country permits him to do so, provided that:

(1)He is of good conduct and has never been convicted of an offence involving his honour or morals;

(2)He has lawful means of livelihood;

(3)He is of sound mind and does not suffer from any impairment that would make him a burden on society;

(4)He takes an oath of allegiance and loyalty to his Majesty before a justice of the peace.

Article 12:
Any person other than a Jordanian who is not incapable by law may apply to the Council of Ministers for grant of a certificate of Jordanian naturalization if:

(1)He has been regularly resident in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan for a period of four years preceding the date of his application;

(2)He intends to reside in the Hashemite Kingdom of the Jordan.

==Birth in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan==
Birth in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan does not in itself confer Jordanian citizenship. Therefore, [[Jus soli]] does not apply.

==Loss of Jordanian citizenship==
A Jordanian may neither lose Jordanian citizenship nor acquire the nationality of another nation without the consent of the Board of Ministers, unless that other nation is an Arab state.

===Renunciation===
Jordanian law permits voluntary renunciation of Jordanian citizenship, with the permission of the Board of Ministers. Someone wishing to renounce their citizenship must contact the a Jordanian consular or diplomatic officer or a Jordanian embassy within a foreign nation and pay the required fee and further be approved by the Ministry of the Interior.

===Loss due to cessation of paternity===
A child whose Jordanian citizenship depends on paternal links loses citizenship when those are cut.

===Loss due to adoption===
A Jordanian child adopted by foreign parents is considered to have lost Jordanian citizenship.

====Annulled adoptions====
Where a former Jordanian citizen lost citizenship due to adoption by foreign parents and that adoption is later annulled, the Jordanian citizenship is considered to never have been lost.

===Dual Citizenship===
Even though Jordanian nationality law permits multiple citizenship, a Jordanian national who also holds another country's citizenship may be required to renounce the foreign citizenship, under the foreign country's nationality law. A dual Jordanian-Japanese national must, for instance, make a declaration of choice, to the Japanese [[Ministry of Justice (Japan)|Ministry of Justice]], before turning 22, as to whether he or she wants to keep the Jordanian or [[Japanese citizenship]].

===Loss due to misconduct===
A person who commits misconduct that undermines the security of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan may be stripped and his family of their citizenships

===Loss due to foreign defense registration===
A person who joins the Armed Forces of another state will lose their Jordanian citizenship.

==Reforms==
Since 2010, there has been an increasing public demand for giving the opportunity for Jordanian women to transmit their Jordanian nationality to their children and also to their husbands. In recent years, growing domestic pressures and foreign concerns have demanded the Jordanian government to grant civil rights to the children of Jordanian women married to foreigners, including the right to receive treatment in hospitals affiliated with the Ministry of Health, the right to obtain residency permits and the right to education in public schools and universities. This is in addition to their right to work, obtain driver’s licenses and perhaps grant them ordinary passports (without a national number) to facilitate their travel outside the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/politics/2014/01/jordan-debate-citizenship-rights-palestinians.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 September 2014, amidst growing public outcry and pressures from foreign leaders such as the United States Secretary of State [[John Kerry]], Jordanian Prime Minister [[Abdullah Ensour]] announced the government's approval to grant children of Jordanian women married to foreigners certain privileges and facilities to ease their lives within Jordan.

{{cquote|Today we meet to fulfil our pledge to the children of our Jordanian daughters by accepting many of what the parliamentary committee suggested by facilitating numerous official matters for their children from a foreign marriage.}}

The regulations were issued on 4 January 2015 and, near the end of the month, the Civil Status and Passports Department (CSPD) had received 9,741 applications to issue special identification cards for children of Jordanian women married to foreigners. Marwan Qteishat, director of the CSPD, told [[The Jordan Times]] near the end of January 2015 that they had issued 965 identification cards and processed 2,148 applications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jordantimes.com/news/local/over-9000-children-jordanian-women-married-foreigners-apply-ids]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revocation of citizenship from Jordanian citizens of Palestinian origin==
Since 1988, and especially over the past few years, the Jordanian government has been arbitrarily and without notice withdrawing Jordanian nationality from its citizens of Palestinian origin, making them stateless.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/report/2010/02/01/stateless-again/palestinian-origin-jordanians-deprived-their-nationality]&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Human Rights Watch]] has stated, this is in direct violation of Jordan's nationality law of 1954 which provides that Palestinian residents of the West Bank in 1949 or thereafter received full Jordanian nationality following Jordan's incorporation of the West Bank in April 1950.

Palestinians who moved from the [[West Bank]] (whether refugees or not) to Jordan, are issued yellow-ID cards to distinguish them from the Palestinians of the "official 10 refugee camps" in Jordan. From 1988 to 2012, thousands of those yellow-ID card Palestinians had their Jordanian citizenship revoked.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/14/world/middleeast/14jordan.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Jordan's Interior Minister Nayef al-Kadi said: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Our goal is to prevent Israel from emptying the Palestinian territories of their original inhabitants," the minister explained, confirming that the kingdom had begun revoking the citizenship of Palestinians.

"We should be thanked for taking this measure," he said. "We are fulfilling our national duty because Israel wants to expel the Palestinians from their homeland."&lt;ref name=Jordan&gt;{{cite news|first=KHALED |last=Abu toameh |title=Amman revoking Palestinians' citizenship |url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1246443863400&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull |publisher=The Jerusalem Post |date=20 July 2009 |accessdate=23 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429194852/http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1246443863400&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull |archivedate=29 April 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="anti-israel-bias" &gt;[http://www.jpost.com/LandedPages/PrintArticle.aspx?id=183252 Demonizing Israel is bad for the Palestinians], by Mudar Zarhan, 01/08/2010, Jerusalem Post&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Human Rights Watch]] estimated that about 2,700 Palestinians were stripped of Jordanian nationality between 2004 and 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/news/2010/02/01/jordan-stop-withdrawing-nationality-palestinian-origin-citizens Jordan: Stop Withdrawing Nationality from Palestinian-Origin Citizens] - [[Human Rights Watch]].&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that over 40,000 Palestinians were affected by this policy.&lt;ref name=Jordan2&gt;{{cite news|author=KHALED ABU TOAMEH and YAAKOV KATZ |title=Israel: We 'won't make Jordan Palestine' |url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1249418582807&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull |publisher=The Jerusalem Post |date=12 August 2009 |accessdate=13 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120929033231/http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1249418582807&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull |archivedate=29 September 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jordanian government has said that these actions are akin to those of other Arab nations with the intention of helping Jordanians of Palestinian descent by requiring those who fled the [[West Bank]] or [[Jerusalem]] after the war in 1967 to keep their Israeli documents valid since the Israeli government continues to shift further right-wing under the leadership of its conservative foreign minister [[Avigdor Lieberman]]. Nabil Sharif, the former minister of state for media affairs and Jordanian ambassador to [[Morocco]], said: {{cquote|It is no secret that some elements in Israel would like to see the Palestinian areas without the people. We do not want to be party to this.}}

In 2012, the Jordanian government promised to stop revoking the citizenship of Palestinians, and restored citizenship to 4,500 Palestinians who had previously lost it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesofisrael.com/jordan-promises-to-stop-revoking-nationality-from-palestinians/ Jordan promises to stop revoking citizenship from Palestinians] - ''[[Times of Israel]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

However, many have criticized the actions of the Jordanian government as an underhanded move to preserve the government's own interest by trying to appease non-Palestinian Jordanians concerned about the growing economic and political influence of citizens of Palestinian descent, which Nabil Sharif had denied.

'''Margaret Crittendon Douglass''' (born 1822; year of death unknown) was a  [[Southern United States|Southern]] white woman  who served one month in jail in 1854 for teaching free black children to read in [[Norfolk, Virginia]].  Refusing to hire a defense attorney, she defended herself in court and later published a book about her experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Appletons|wstitle = Douglass, Margaret Crittenden}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case drew public attention to the [[Education during the Slave Period|highly restrictive laws against black literacy]] in the [[Antebellum South|pre-Civil War American South]].&lt;ref&gt;Douglass, Margaret,  Educational Laws of Virginia: The Personal Narrative of  Mrs. Margaret Douglass, a Southern Woman Who Was Imprisoned for One Month in the Common Jail of Norfolk, John P. Jewett and Co., 1854&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davison Lawson, John, American State Trials: A Collection of the Important and Interesting Criminal Trials which Have Taken Place in the United States, from the Beginning of Our Government to the Present Day : with Notes and Annotations, Volume 7, Thomas Law Book Company, 1914,&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Douglass was born  in 1822 in [[Washington, D.C.]], but moved in her childhood to [[Charleston, South Carolina]], where she married. By age fourteen, she had given birth to a daughter, Hannah Rosa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/sse.dll?gss=angs-g&amp;new=1&amp;rank=1&amp;msT=1&amp;gsfn=Margaret&amp;gsfn_x=0&amp;gsln=Douglass&amp;gsln_x=0&amp;mswpn__ftp=Norfolk%2c+Independent+Cities%2c+Virginia%2c+USA&amp;mswpn=24283&amp;mswpn_PInfo=8-%7c0%7c1652393%7c0%7c2%7c3245%7c49%7c0%7c24255%7c24283%7c0%7c&amp;MSAV=1&amp;msbdy=1822&amp;cp=0&amp;catbucket=rstp&amp;uidh=r94&amp;pcat=ROOT_CATEGORY&amp;h=15375122&amp;db=1850usfedcenancestry&amp;indiv=1&amp;ml_rpos=1 Margaret Douglass, Hannah Rosa Douglass, 1850 Census, Norfolk, Virginia, www. ancestry.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  She also birthed a son, who died. Nothing is known about her husband. In 1845, she and her daughter relocated to Norfolk, Virginia, where she established herself in a modest apartment in a tenement neighborhood and made ends meet by running her own business as a seamstress and vest maker. She chose not to participate in social activities with her white neighbors in the nearby tenements, who she felt were "not of the most refined class". She notes in her memoir that this made her unpopular in the neighborhood. She described her life as "frugal and retiring", and that it was "necessary for me to labor incessantly".&lt;ref&gt;Douglass, Margaret, The Personal Narrative of Mrs. Margaret Douglass, a Southern Woman Who Was Imprisoned for One Month in the Common Jail of Norfolk, John P. Jewett and Co., 1854 p.6-9&lt;/ref&gt;

==The school==
In 1853 she paid a business visit to the [[barber]] shop of a free black man named Robinson.  Mr. Robinson was  a man of influence in the community  of  more than 1500 [[Free negro|free people of color]] who lived in Norfolk at that time.&lt;ref&gt;John Henderson Russell, The Free Negro in Virginia, 1619-1865 (Baltimore, Md.: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1913), 57-58. [https://familysearch.org/learn/wiki/en/Virginia_African_Americans#Free_People_of_Colo Digital version] at [https://archive.org/details/freenegro00russrich Internet Archiv].&lt;/ref&gt;  His two young sons were busy studying a [[Primer (textbook)|reading primer]], so Douglass asked Robinson if there wasn't a school in town where free black children could learn to read.  Robinson said  that there was only the Sunday school at Christ Church  where, he said, "they didn't learn much."  Douglass returned home and asked her teenaged daughter, Hannah Rosa, if she would like to tutor the boys.  Hannah Rosa said she would, and the boys began to receive free reading lessons at the Douglass home, using the books they received at church. Eventually, Robiinson took his sons back to the barber shop where he needed their help, and sent his two daughters instead. In her memoir, Douglass states that the two girls were intelligent, attentive, made rapid progress, and were "a source of pleasure to us."

A month later, Margaret and Hannah Rosa decided to open a small school for free black children in their home, and  charge three dollars per student per quarter. Robinson spread word to the free black community, and the school was deluged with applications. For 11 months, they taught 25 children, who Douglass described as "well-behaved" and "anxious to be taught".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part4/4h2945.html|title=Mrs. Margaret Douglass|website=www.pbs.org|access-date=2017-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; When one of her female students grew ill, Douglass made regular visits to her home, and  arranged for and participated in the girl's funeral  when she died.  This, according to Douglass, was not approved of by other whites in the community.&lt;ref&gt;Douglass,  p.9-11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrest ==
On the  morning of May 9, 1853, while Hannah Rosa and the children were assembled at their desks, two police officers stationed themselves at the front and back door of her house.  They informed Margaret and Hannah Rosa that teaching free black children was illegal under Virginia law, then took the two women and the twenty-five terrified children on foot to the mayor's office.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/brown/brown-segregation.html#obj1|title=A Century of Racial Segregation 1849–1950 - Brown v.

"You have a very large family", Mayor Stubbs commented when she and the 25 children arrived at his office. He then asked her if she was aware of the law. Douglass responded that she didn't know teaching free black children was illegal, but that if it were  illegal for her to teach the children it should also be illegal for the church to do it, since she was using the same books. The mayor dismissed the matter and sent everyone home, after assuring Douglass that nothing would happen to the black children or their families.&lt;ref&gt;American State Trials, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside the courtroom, Douglass noted that she was met by a group of free black adults, parents of the children and their friends, waiting to hear the decision and offering to pay for any penalties or bail she might incur. 
She gathered the children back at the school, gave them back their books and slates, and said goodbye. "It was a sad parting", she wrote in her memoir.&lt;ref&gt;Douglass, p.20&lt;/ref&gt;

After her daughter Hannah Rosa left Norfolk for New York on  June 29, Douglas was left alone, receiving however frequent gifts of flowers from her former students who stopped by to see her.

Of the outpouring of support she received from the black community. Douglas writes, "In my opinion, those who call the Southern Negroes ungrateful are only those who never do anything to call forth that emotion....May I ask what gratitude they owe to those who would degrade them?  What gratitude does that child owe to his own father, who would coldly sell  him as  a slave?"&lt;ref&gt;Douglass, p. 14–20&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial==
Although she thought the case was now behind her, on July 13, she was served legal papers for a [[Grand jury|Grand Jury Indictment]] for her and her 17-year-old daughter, which stated: "Each of them did unlawfully assemble with diver negros, for the purpose of instructing them to read and to write, and did instruct them to read and to write, contrary to the act of the General Assembly, in such case made and provided, and against the peace and dignity of the Commonwealth of Virginia'.&lt;ref&gt;American State Trials, p.49&lt;/ref&gt;

Having little money and 'little affection for lawyers', Douglass decided to defend herself. She did not mention the upcoming trial to her daughter, who was still in New York, until September 1, when she instructed her to stay until further notice. On November 11, she entered the crowded courtroom alone, wearing a black velvet dress, white kid gloves and a plain straw bonnet. 'Everyone present seemed to be confused, except myself,' she noted.&lt;ref&gt;Douglass, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

She called three male members of Christ's Church as her witnesses, two of them also lawyers, one who had signed the summons against her. The excitement in the courtroom when these three witnesses arrived was 'most intense', she noted. In her memoir, she states that these men, who she describes as part of the 'aristocracy' of Norfolk, were either lecturers at the church's Sunday school, or had wives and daughters who were, and had given the free black children of the community the same books she was using to teach them to read. The witnesses either denied teaching altogether or said they had only provided moral and religious instruction, but did not teach the black children how to read and write.

In her closing speech to the jury, Douglass described herself as a Southern woman, a former slave-holder. She said she was not against [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]], and strongly opposed to northern [[abolitionist]] interference, though she believed their 'principles are based on a religious foundation'. She believed, she said, in 'the duty of every Southerner, morally and religiously to instruct his slaves, that they may know their duties to their masters and their common God. Let the masters first do their duty to them, for they are still our slaves and servants, whether bond or free, and can be nothing else in our community.' She also challenged the indifference of the white population towards the situation of the free and enslaved black population, where there was misery, starvation, and harsh laws in place to control them, noting that it was illegal for more than two or three of them to assemble in one place, for whatever reason.

'When they are sick, or in want, on whom does the duty devolve to seek them out and administer to their necessities? Does it fall upon you, gentlemen? Oh no, it is not expected that gentlemen will take the trouble to seek out a negro hut for the purpose of alleviating the wretchedness he may find within it. Why then persecute your benevolent ladies for doing that which you yourselves have so long neglected? Shall we treat our slaves with less compassion than we do the cattle in the field?"

She also told the jury that although they had nothing to fear from the 'true blooded' negroes, she felt that those who had 'white blood in their veins' were 'presumptuous, treacherous, and revengeful.' "Ask how that white blood got beneath those tawny skins," she suggested, "and let nature herself account for the exhibition of these instincts. Blame the authors of this devilish mischief, but not the victims of it."

In closing, she offered that she was willing to go to prison if she had to, but that the black anti-literacy law, she said, was 'one of the most inhuman and unjust laws that ever disgraced the statute book of a civilized community.' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.civilwarwomenblog.com/margaret-douglass/|title=Margaret Douglass – Civil War Women|website=www.civilwarwomenblog.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;American State Trials, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

When she rested her case, the judge asked if anyone wanted to speak in her favor. No one came forward.

Douglass successfully argued for dropping the charges against Hannah Rosa, since she was still a minor. At the close of the trial, the jury deliberated for two days, found her guilty, and fined her one dollar. She then left for New York to retrieve her daughter.

==Sentencing and jail==
On January 10, 1854, she was called back before Judge Baker for further sentencing.

The Judge noted that some people in Norfolk were opposed to the law, and chided her for 'the indiscreet freedom with which you spoke of the colored race in general'. 'Such opinions I regard as manifestly mischievous', he said. The Church officials, he said, were allowed to instruct the children because religious instruction is necessary for black people. Black literacy, however, is dangerous. He described the law as a "matter of self-defense against Northern anti-slavery agitators who clog the mail with anti-slavery pamphlets to be distributed among Southern Negroes to induce them to cut our throats," and who "scattered pocket handkerchiefs around with anti-slavery engravings to work upon the feelings and ignorance of our negroes, who otherwise would remain comfortable and happy". He also admonished her for speaking directly and honestly in her own defense instead of hiring an attorney, which would have allowed her case to have been presented in a 'far more favorable light'. Her 'bold and open opposition', he said, 'is a matter not to be slightly regarded' and 'something more substantial is required in this case'.

'For these reasons', he continued, 'as an example to all others in like cases disposed to offend, and in vindication of the policy and justness of our laws, which every individual should be taught to respect, the judgment of the Court is, in addition to the proper fine and costs, that you be imprisoned for the period of one month in the jail of this city'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part4/4h2945t.html The Case of Mrs. Margaret Douglass, Africans in America, PBS.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Douglass served out her sentence. Having no where else to stay when she was released, the jailer and his wife put her up for two days before she moved with her daughter to Philadelphia.

==Media coverage==
The case received substantial media coverage at the time, both for and against Douglass and the anti-literacy law. Under the headline "Her Own Lawyer," an editor in the ''Petersburg Daily Express'' wrote of how the courtroom was 'filled with persons anxious to witness the novel spectacle' of a woman defending herself and compared her speech making abilities to renowned feminists like [[Lucy Stone]].&lt;ref&gt;Her Own Lawyer, Petersburg Daily Express, 1853, cited in Douglass&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite her disavowal of abolitionism,  she was hailed as a heroine by abolitionists. [[William Lloyd Garrison]], in his abolitionist newspaper, ''The Liberator'',  noted that a Quaker woman in Norfolk had delivered a sermon on Douglass' behalf while Douglass was in jail and stated, "The women are a great trouble to our Norfolk neighbors", he said. "If they want peace, they will have to expel all Christian women... from the city."  &lt;ref&gt;Garrison, William LLoyd, The Liberator, November, 1853, cited in ''Religion and the Antebellum Debate Over Slavery'', John McKivigan, Mitchell Snay  University of Georgia Press, p. 187&lt;/ref&gt;

The editor of the Virginia newspaper ''The Argus'' wrote that although the Norfolk community was reluctant to put a white woman in prison, 'there rose a righteous indignation towards a person who would throw contempt in the face of our laws, and brave the imprisonment for 'the cause of humanity' '.

'Let her depart hence with only one wish, that her presence will never be intruded upon us again. Let her seek her associates at the North, and with them commingle, but let us put a check to such mischievous views as fell from her lips last November, sentiments unworthy of a resident of the State, and in direct rebellion against our Constitution", he wrote.

In the religious publication ''Covenanter: Devoted to the Principles of the Reformed Presbyterian Church'', (Volume 9, 1853) David Smith called upon the Presbyterian General Assembly to intercede with the U.S. government to "secure for all its citizens the rights of teaching human beings to read the language of their country..." He noted that the United States government had interceded when Presbyterian women had been imprisoned in foreign Catholic countries for passing out Bibles, but would not intervene in Douglas's case.

The case, Smith said, has "exposed the country to the contempt and hissing of every  civilized country on earth".&lt;ref&gt;''Covenanter, Devoted to the Principles of the Reformed Presbyterian Church,'' Volume 9, 1853&lt;/ref&gt;

==Memoir and legacy==
In 1854, Douglass published her memoir of the event, ''Educational Laws of Virginia: The Personal Narrative of Mrs. Margaret Douglass, a Southern Woman, who was Imprisoned for One Month in the Common Jail of Norfolk, Under the Laws of Virginia, for the Crime of Teaching Free Colored Children to Read.'' In it, she describes the trial as well as the events that led up to it, and includes the speech she made in her own self-defense.  As she did in her courtroom speech, she criticizes the black literacy and assembly laws as well as white indifference to the situation of blacks, but identifies herself as a Southern supporter of slavery, and a [[white supremacist]]:

"I have been a slaveholder myself, and, if circumstances rendered it necessary or practicable, I might be such again".&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/stream/personalnarrativ1854doug#page/5/mode/1up&lt;/ref&gt;

Pointing out that many of the black and [[mixed race]] children she was teaching were the children of the same white men who aided in the prosecution against her, she lays some of the blame for the condition of black people on Southern white men who sexually abused enslaved black women. This, she believed, is the root of the  anti-literacy law. "How important then for these Southern Sultans that the objects of their criminal passions should be kept in utter ignorance and degradation", she writes. She speaks of the  silent frustration of white women who know of their husbands' 'tawny mistresses' and the powerlessness of black women, who have "parents, brothers, sisters, a lover perhaps, all of whom suffer through and with her, and in whose hearts spring up roots of bitterness which are destined to grow into trees whose branches will sooner or later overshadow the whole land." She ends her memoir calling upon her white "Southern sisters" to  remedy this situation:

"I know my Southern sisters well enough to believe that they will not much longer rest tamely under the influence of this damning curse. I have told them plainly of the evil. The remedy is in their hands".&lt;ref&gt;Douglass&lt;/ref&gt;

Little is known about Margaret Douglass's life after her trial.

In June 1865 the members of the free black community of Norfolk, Virginia petitioned the federal government to abolish the restrictive literacy and assembly laws that were still in place in their community.&lt;ref&gt;http://nationalhumanitiescenter.org/pds/maai2/freedom/text5/equalsuffrage.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The law was abolished in 1867.

Documents and publications about Douglass's trial and her subsequent memoir have helped shed light on the era she lived in for scholars of American history, race relations, women's history, religion and law.&lt;ref&gt;Joshua Rhodes Balme Hamilton, "American States,Churches and Slavery" Adams and Company, 1864&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;: Christopher Lasch, Elisabeth Lasch-Quinn Women and the Common Life: Love, Marriage, and Feminism, W.W. Norton and Co, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; One legal scholar wrote that with the case of Margaret Douglass: "The modern era of Anglo-American Law had arrived early, and the principal actor had been, appropriately, a woman.   Her jury speech had, appropriately, employed the female metaphor of the family, in which all the children deserved equality of treatment. It was a metaphor, and an idea, that would come to dominate the legal discourse of America." &lt;ref&gt;The Life of the Law: The People and Cases that Have Shaped Our Society,  By Alfred H. Knight.  Oxford University Press, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''referendum on the new [[constitution of France]]''' was held in [[New Caledonia]] on 28 September 1958 as part of a [[French constitutional referendum, 1958|wider referendum]] held across the [[French Union]]. The new constitution would see the country become part of the new [[French Community]] if accepted, or result in independence if rejected. It was approved by 98.12% of voters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sudd.ch/event.php?lang=en&amp;id=fr011958 Frankreich, 28. September 1958 : Verfassung] Direct Democracy&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2674">The '''PFI Convention''' is a multilateral treaty between the old and new member states of the European Union on the topic of [[fraud]] and came into force on 17 October 2002.

The full name of the treaty is the '''Convention on the protection of the European Communities' financial interests'''. It was introduced by the ''Council Act of 26 July 1995 drawing up the Convention on the protection of the European Communities' financial interests''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title= Council Act of 26 July 1995 drawing up the Convention on the protection of the European Communities' financial interests|url= http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:31995F1127(03)&amp;from=EN|journal= [[Official Journal of the European Union]]|date= 27 November 1995|volume= 38|issue= C 316|pages= 48{{en dash}}57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This convention harmonised the legal definition and criminal liability of fraud and replaced the old European treaties on fraud. It creates a unified definition of [[fraud]], and signatory states have to ensure that criminal sanctions are in effect for it.&lt;ref&gt;Convention, art. 1&lt;/ref&gt; All EU Member states have ratified the convention, and it is available for accession by any future incoming EU member state.&lt;ref name=PIF&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/documents-publications/agreements-conventions/agreement/?aid=1995107|title=Convention drawn up on the basis of Article K.3 of the Treaty on European Union, on the protection of the European Communities' financial interests|accessdate=2015-06-27|publisher=Council of the European Union}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=URISERV:l33019|title= Protecting the EU’s financial interests - fight against fraud|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website= eur-lex.europa.eu|publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Political positivism''' is a theory founded by [[Ljubisa Bojic]] ({{lang-sr|Ljubiša Bojić|script=Latn}}). It includes intensive use of media to promote [[Cooperation|unity]], [[participation (ownership)|participation]], and positivism in thinking of common men and women.

==Short explanation==
Gradual [[social change|change]] of individuals results in a big alteration for the [[community]] as a whole{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}. [[Psychology]] is the key to our success{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}. On the other hand, various media can impact great masses of people. Until today, [[politicians]] used TV programs, [[Mass media|press]], and different kind of [[propaganda]] to trigger [[wars]], stimulate hate and impose conflict between people. Optimistic thinking enables us to make the difference together{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}.

===Introduction of the term===
"Let we develop positivism as a new [[ideology]] - and the only one that can’t hurt anybody. Let’s alter use of [[Mass media|media]] for the greater reason", said Ljubisa Bojic during a gathering of Serbian Strengths Movement supporters in [[Kragujevac]] on 24 February 2007.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} He said, this proposition would be introduced to the international community at the [[Young Democratic Leaders Network]] summit in Istanbul (2007).

===Introduction===
Political positivism abides by this philosophy:

Creative media use in needed for education, to increment people rather than to amuse. Entertainment makes 99% of the world news at present. Political positivism, or media positivism includes intensive use of media to promote unity, participation, and positivism in thinking of common men and women. Gradual change of the citizens results in a big change for the society. If we all think optimistic, and have strong will to do something together, we can make the difference.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

===The roots===
[[Martin Seligman]] officially initiated the study of [[positive psychology]] in 1998, during his term as President of the [[American Psychological Association]]. University of East London was the first in Europe to offer postgraduate diploma in Applied positive psychology as “the scientific study of optimal human functioning with an aim to understand the factors that enable individuals and communities to thrive. This rapidly developing field brings solid empirical research into areas such as well-being, [[Flow (psychology)|flow]], positive emotions, human strengths, wisdom, creativity, psychological health and characteristics of positive groups and institutions.”{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} 

Late Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic offered change in a way of thinking to Serbian citizens. He used to go around the country and tell people that change starts with them. His determination continues to live in today’s Serbia. Djindjic said that everyone gets to be a winner of the “life battle” at birth. Numerous governments, such as Hong Kong, have branding initiatives with notable internal impact. Some of them, broadcast ads which help people in many ways. They bear messages warning viewers to save energy, or help keep clear the city….

===Ministry===
Ministry of positivism would consist of psychologists and advertisers who would work together as a team. Their main aim is to significant positive influence on citizens lives. Interdisciplinary team of professionals from the ministry would maintain strong relation with the universities where applied positive psychology is examined.

===The Law===
Users of public broadcasting licenses would be obliged to provide share of their programs for free. The same goes for the print media, outdoor billboards space etc. New legislation introduced to the parliament would define aspects of media use by the state.

===Assets===
University of Pennsylvania states that positive psychology is study of positive emotions, positive character, and positive institutions. Variety of assets is to be used to motivate members of society to change themselves. Except special positive TV, radio, paper, and billboard advertisements with general messages, lectures, seminars, tutorials, workshops, group exercises will be offered by the Ministry of positivism.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

===Types of ads===
1. Advertisements carrying strong subconscious messages. 
2. Creative ads with general slogans aimed to inspire basic human emotions and optimism.
3. Narrow appeals to the public such as: “Exercise once daily”.
4. Thematic short TV, radio shows and newspaper texts embracing tips for better life.

===Applied psychology===
Character Strengths and Virtues (CSV) handbook identifies core virtues, made up of twenty-four measurable character strengths. The organization of these virtues and strengths is as follows:
1. Wisdom and Knowledge: creativity, curiosity, open-mindedness, love of learning, perspective
2. Courage: bravery, persistence, integrity, vitality
3. Humanity: love, kindness, social intelligence
4. Justice: citizenship, fairness, leadership
5. Temperance: forgiveness and mercy, humility and modesty, prudence, self-regulation
6. Transcendence: appreciation of beauty and excellence, gratitude, hope, humor, spirituality

[[File:French Prefect.jpg|thumb|300px|A French prefect]]
'''Prefect''' (from the [[Latin]] ''praefectus'', substantive adjectival&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=H6IAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA121&amp;lpg=PA121&amp;dq=praefectus+part+of+speech&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0Pg-bN4f8Y&amp;sig=vVz_HpZqEM7GDS3lYYZmFfXPVnE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rfx0VYeqCI-AygSHzYDADQ&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=praefectus%20part%20of%20speech&amp;f=false Adam's Latin Grammar]&lt;/ref&gt; form of ''praeficere'':  "put in front", i.e., in charge) is a [[Magistrate|magisterial]] title of varying definition, but which, basically, refers to the leader of an administrative area.

A prefect's office, department, or area of control is called a [[prefecture]], but in various post-[[Roman empire]] cases there is a prefect without a prefecture or ''vice versa''. The words "prefect" and "prefecture" are also used, more or less conventionally, to render analogous words in other languages, especially [[Romance languages]].

==Ancient Rome==
{{Roman government}}
''Praefectus'', often with a further qualification, was the formal title of many, fairly low to high-ranking, military or civil officials in the [[Roman Empire]], whose authority was not embodied in their person (as it was with elected Magistrates) but conferred by delegation from a higher authority. They did have some authority in their prefecture such as controlling prisons and in civil administration.

===Praetorian prefects===
The [[Praetorian prefect]] (''Praefectus praetorio'') began as the military commander of a general's guard company in the field, then grew in importance as the [[Praetorian Guard]] became a potential kingmaker during the Empire. From the Emperor [[Diocletian]]'s [[tetrarchy]] (c. 300) they became the administrators of the four [[Praetorian prefecture]]s, the government level above the (newly created) dioceses and (multiplied) [[Roman province|provinces]].

===Police and civil prefects===
*''[[Praefectus urbi]]'', or ''[[praefectus urbanus]]'': city prefect, in charge of the administration of Rome.
*''[[Praefectus vigilum]]'': commander of the ''[[Vigiles]]'' (firemen and police).
*''Praefectus aerarii'': nobles appointed guardians of the state treasury.
* ''[[Aerarium militare|Praefectus aerarii militaris]]'': prefect of the military treasury.
*''[[Praefectus annonae]]'': official charged with the supervision of the grain supply to the city of Rome.

===Military prefects===
*''Praefectus alae'': commander of a cavalry unit.
*''[[Praefectus castrorum]]'': camp commandant.&lt;ref name="Berger"&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedic Dictionary of Roman Law|first=Adolf|last=Berger|page=643|publisher=The Lawbook Exchange|year=2002|isbn=1-58477-142-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Praefectus cohortus|Praefectus cohortis]]'': commander of a [[Cohort (military unit)|cohort]] (constituent unit of a legion, or analogous unit).
*''[[Praefectus classis]]'': fleet commander.&lt;ref name="Berger"/&gt;
*''Praefectus equitatus'': cavalry commander.
*''Praefectus equitum'': cavalry commander.
*''[[Roman military engineering|Praefectus fabrum]]'': officer in charge of ''fabri'', i.e. well-trained engineers and artisans.&lt;ref name="Berger"/&gt;
*''Praefectus legionis'': equestrian legionary commander.&lt;ref name="Berger"/&gt;
*''Praefectus legionis agens vice legati'': equestrian acting legionary commander.
*''Praefectus orae maritimae'': official in charge with the control and defense of an important sector of [[sea coast]].&lt;ref name="Berger"/&gt;
*''Praefectus socium (sociorum)'': Roman officer appointed to a command function in an ''ala sociorum'' (unit recruited among the ''socii'', Italic peoples of a privileged status within the empire).

For some auxiliary troops, specific titles could even refer to their peoples:
* [[Praefectus Laetorum]] (Germanic, notably in Gaul)
* Praefectus Sarmatarum gentilium (from the [[steppe]]s, notably in Italy)

===Prefects as provincial governors===
Roman provinces were usually ruled by high-rank officials. Less important provinces though were entrusted to prefects, military men who would otherwise only govern parts of larger provinces. The most famous example is [[Pontius Pilate]], who governed [[Iudaea Province|Judaea]] at a time when it was administered as an annex of [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]].

As Egypt was a special imperial domain, a rich and strategic granary, where the Emperor enjoyed an almost [[Pharaoh|pharaonic]] position unlike any other province or diocese, its head was styled uniquely ''[[Praefectus Augustalis]]'', indicating that he governed in the personal name of the emperor, the "Augustus". [[Septimius Severus]], after conquering [[Mesopotamia]], introduced the same system there too.

After the mid-1st century, as a result of the [[Pax Romana]], the governorship was gradually shifted from the military prefects to civilian fiscal officials called [[Procurator (Roman)|procurators]], Egypt remaining the exception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livius.org/gi-gr/governor/governor.html |title=Provincial governors (Roman) |work=Livius.org |publisher=Jona Lendering  |date=|accessdate=2014-12-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious prefects===
* ''Praefectus urbi'': a prefect of the republican era who guarded the city during the annual sacrifice of the ''{{lang-la|feriae latina}}'' on Mount Alban in which the [[Roman consul|consul]]s participated. His former title was "''custos urbi''" ("guardian of the city").

==Feudal times==
Especially in [[Medieval Latin]], ''præfectus'' was used to refer to various officers&amp;mdash;administrative, military, judicial, etc.&amp;mdash;usually alongside a more precise term in the vernacular (such as ''[[Burggraf]]'', which literally means ''Count of the Castle'' in the German language).

==Ecclesiastical==
[[File:Sainte Marguerite et Olibrius.jpg|thumb|right|[[Saint Margaret the Virgin|Saint Margaret]] attracts the attention of the Roman prefect, by [[Jean Fouquet]] from an [[illuminated manuscript]]]]
{{Catholic Church hierarchy sidebar}}

The term is used by the [[Roman Catholic Church]], which based much of its canon law terminology on Roman law, in several different ways.
* The [[Roman Curia]] has the nine Prefects of all the [[Congregation (Roman Curia)|Congregations]] as well as the two of the Papal Household and of the Economic Affairs of the Holy See.
* The title also attaches to the heads of some [[Pontifical Council]] (central departments of the Curia), who are principally titled president, but in addition there is sometimes an additional ''ex officio'' position as a prefect. For example, the president of the [[Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue]] is also the prefect of the Commission for Religious Relations with Muslims.
*Traditionally these Curial officials are [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinals]], hence often called "Cardinal-Prefect" or "Cardinal-President".  There was a custom that those who were not cardinals when they were appointed were titled "Pro-Prefect" or "Pro-President". Then these officials would be appointed prefect or president after their elevation to the Sacred College. However, since 1998, this custom has fallen into disuse.
* A [[Prefect Apostolic]] is a cleric (sometimes a [[Titular Bishop]], but normally a priest) in charge of an [[apostolic prefecture]], a type of Roman Catholic territorial jurisdiction fulfilling the functions of a diocese, usually in a missionary area or in a country that is anti-religious, such as the [[People's Republic of China]], but that is not yet given the status of regular diocese. It is usually destined to become one in time.

==Academic==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Monitor]] --&gt;
* In the context of [[school]]s, a prefect is a pupil who has been given certain responsibilities in the school, similar to the responsibilities given to a [[hall monitor]] or [[safety patrol]] members.
* In some [[United Kingdom|British]], [[Ireland|Irish]] and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] schools (especially but not exclusively [[Independent school (UK)|independent schools]]), prefects, usually students in fifth to seventh years (depending on how many years the school in question has), have considerable power; in some cases they effectively run the school outside the classroom. They were once allowed to administer [[school corporal punishment]] in some schools (now abolished in the UK and several other countries). They usually answer to a senior prefect known as the ''Head of School'' (though in Canada, ''Head of School'' is more often seen as a gender-neutral term for headmaster or headmistress) or ''Head Prefect'' or ''[[Head Boy]]'' or ''[[Head Girl]]'' or ''Senior Prefect''. Larger schools may have a hierarchical structure with a team of prefects, a team of senior prefects, and a Head Boy and Girl. The Head Prefect may also be the ''[[School Captain]]'' if that is an appointed position in the school. However, due to Health and Safety laws the staff have tended to become stricter about what responsibilities prefects may hold, for fear of being held responsible in case of litigation.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} This system is also practised in [[Hong Kong]], a former British colony. Today, prefect roles in the U.K. are largely perfunctory and are mostly used to reward the better students in the year groups that qualify for prefect roles. Duties tend to be limited to door monitoring during recess and representing the school at various extra-curricular events.
* In [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Singapore]] and [[Malaysia]], prefects are student leaders in primary and secondary schools, often along the lines of other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] schools, but with superior powers. The prefect systems in these countries have changed little from when they were under the British, as the present governments have seen them as effective.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}
* In [[Bangladesh]], Prefects are the leaders in [[Army of Bangladesh|Army]] based educational institutions namely [[Cadet Colleges in Bangladesh|Cadet Colleges]].
* In [[Mexico]], Prefects (in Spanish, ''{{lang|es|prefecta/prefecto}}'') is an adult head of a grade of a school, a US equivalent would be a [[dean (education)|dean]].
* In [[Sweden]], a prefect (''{{lang|sv|[[:sv:prefekt|prefekt]]}}'') is the head of a university department.
* In [[Jesuit]] and other Catholic schools this title was given formerly to members of the faculty, a prefect of discipline in charge of student attendance, general order and such, and a prefect of studies in charge of academic issues.

Many college preparatory boarding schools utilize the position of Prefect as a high student leadership position.

==Modern sub-national administration==
*In '''[[Albania]]''' a prefect (Prefekti) is the State's representative in a region (qark). His agency is called the ''Prefektura''. Albania has 12 prefects in 12 prefectures, appointed by the [[Prime Minister of Albania]] and the [[Council of Ministers of Albania|Government]].
* In '''[[France]]''' the ''[[préfet]]'' (prefect) is a  top ranking public servant who belongs to the so-called ''Corps préfectoral''.  The function was created on 17 February 1800 by Napoléon Bonaparte after his successful coup d'état of 9 November 1799 which made him Head of State with the title ''Premier Consul''. The prefect's role at that time (until the reform of the function in the 1980s) was to be the top representative of the central government as well as the chief administrator in a ''[[département]]'' (which can be compared to a ''county'' in most English-speaking nations) . His agency services as well as his circumscription (=territory in which he is in charge) are called ''[[préfecture]]''. Sub-prefects (''sous-préfets'', ''sous-préfecture'') operate as assistants in the ''[[arrondissement in France|arrondissements]]'' (subdivisions of a ''département'') under his authority and control.

In the 1980s, under the presidency of François Mitterrand (1981-1995), a fundamental change in the role of the prefect (and sub-prefect) took place. The previously extremely centralized French (Fifth) Republic was gradually ''decentralized'' by the creation of the Regions and the devolution of central state powers towards the ''Régions'', ''Départements'' and ''Communes'' (municipalities). New elected authorities  were created (e.g. the ''Conseils régionaux'') in order to administrate the subdivisional entities (''collectivités territoriales'') of the nation (law from 2 March 1982). 
The changes have gradually altered the function of the prefect. He is still the supreme representative of the state in a département, but has lost his omnipotent function of chief administrator. Instead, he has acquired the roles of chief controller (not a title) of regional, departemental and communal public accounts and of chief inspector (not a title) of good (i.e. law-abiding) governance of the authorities of the respective territorial entities.&lt;ref&gt;Le petit Larousse 2013 pp873 and 1420&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''Préfet maritime'' is a French Admiral (''Amiral'') who is commissioned to be  the chief commander of a ''Zone maritime'' (i.e. a section of the French territorial waters and the respective shores).

In [[Paris]], the ''Préfet de police''  ([[Prefecture of Police|prefect of police]]) is the head of the city's police under the direct authority of the ''Ministre de l'Intérieur'' (Minister of the Interior), which makes him unique as usually in French towns and cities the chief of the local police is subordinated to the ''maire'' (mayor), who is the local representative of the minister in police matters.

* {{anchor|Italy}} In '''[[Italy]]''', a prefect (''[[:it:Prefetto (ordinamento italiano)|prefetto]]'') is the State's representative in a [[Provinces of Italy|province]]. His office is called ''Prefettura - Ufficio Territoriale del Governo''. The prefects have political responsibility and coordinate the local [[quaestor]] (''Questore''), who has technical responsibility, to enforce laws when [[public safety]] is threatened. Similar offices already existed under various names before the [[Italian unification]] (1861) (e.g., in the [[Kingdom of Two Sicilies]] it was named "intendente"); in Northern Italy, it was imported from France during the Napoleonic occupation (1802). Its current form dates back to 1861, when the government of [[Bettino Ricasoli]] extended the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]]'s administrative system to the entire country. In the early years the job entailed a more vigorous and vigilant application of central state authority, by enforcing regulations and dispositions in the fields of education, public works, public health, and the nomination of mayors and provincial deputies. Today it essentially plays the role of intermediary between municipalities and other local governments.
* In some '''[[Spanish language|Spanish]]-speaking states in [[Latin America]]''', following a French-type model introduced in Spain itself, prefects were installed as governors; remarkably, in some republics (like Peru) two levels were constructed from the French model: a prefecture and a department, the one being only part of the other.
*In '''[[Greece]]''' a prefect (nomarhis, νομάρχης) used to be the elected head of one of the 54 [[prefectures]] (nomarhies, νομαρχίες), which were second-level administrative divisions, between the first-level [[Peripheries]] (periferies, περιφέρειες) and the third-level [[Municipalities]] (demoi, δήμοι), until their abolition with the [[Kallikratis plan|Kallikratis reform]] in 2010. The Prefectural elections (popular ballot) would be held every four years along with the Municipal elections. The last Prefectural [[elections]] in [[Greece]] were held in October 2006.
* In '''[[Romania]]''', a prefect (''[[Prefect (Romania)|prefect]]'') is the appointed governmental representative in a county (''[[judeţ]]'') and in the Municipality of [[Bucharest]], in an agency called ''prefectură''. The prefect's role is to represent the national government at local level, acting as a liaison and facilitating the implementation of National Development Plans and governing programmes at local level.
* In '''[[Québec]]''', a prefect (''préfet'') is the head of a [[regional county municipality]].
* In '''[[Brazil]]''', a prefect (''prefeito'') is the elected head of the executive branch in a municipality. Larger cities, such as São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Curitiba, etc., also have sub-prefects, appointed to their offices by the elected prefect.
* In '''[[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]''', the nation in the Caucasus region, a prefect (პრეფექტი) was the head of the executive branch in a municipality, appointed by the [[President of Georgia]] from 1990 to 1992.

==Police==
The Prefect of Police (''[[Préfet de police]])'' is the officer in charge of co-ordinating police forces in [[Prefecture of Police of Paris|Paris]] (see above under "France"). The local police in [[Japan]] are divided among prefectures too.

The '''Ramsar Convention on Wetlands of International Importance especially as Waterfowl Habitat''' is an international [[treaty]] for the conservation and sustainable use of [[wetland]]s.&lt;ref name="ramsar"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ramweb-uat.neox24.ch/about/the-ramsar-convention-and-its-mission|title=The Ramsar Convention and its Mission|access-date=11 October 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160409053942/http://ramweb-uat.neox24.ch/about/the-ramsar-convention-and-its-mission|archivedate=9 April 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also known as the '''Convention on Wetlands'''. It is named after the city of [[Ramsar, Mazandaran|Ramsar]] in [[Iran]], where the Convention was signed in 1971.

Every three years, representatives of the Contracting Parties meet as the Conference of the Contracting Parties (COP), the policy-making organ of the Convention which adopts decisions (Resolutions and Recommendations) to administer the work of the Convention and improve the way in which the Parties are able to implement its objectives. The most recent COP12 was held in [[Punta del Este]], [[Uruguay]], in 2015. COP13 will take place in [[Dubai]], [[United Arab Emirates]], in October 2018.

[[File:Archipel Bolama-Bijagos Ramsar Site in Guinea-Bissau.jpg|thumb|Archipel Bolama-Bijagos Ramsar Site in Guinea-Bissau]]

{{Main article|List of Ramsar wetlands of international importance}}

The List of Wetlands of International Importance included '''2,331 Ramsar Sites''' in May 2018 covering over {{Convert|2.1|e6km2|sqmi}}. The country with the highest number of Sites is the United Kingdom with 170, and the country with the greatest area of listed wetlands is Bolivia, with over {{Convert|140,000|km2|}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://rsis.ramsar.org/|title=Ramsar Sites Information Service|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ramsar Sites Information Service (RSIS) is a searchable database which provides information on each Ramsar Site.

==International cooperation==
[[File:Ramsar transboundary Site Wadden Sea.jpg|thumb|Wadden Sea is a Transboundary Ramsar Site covering 13 Ramsar sites in Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands]]

{{Main|List of parties to the Ramsar Convention}}
As of 2016 there are 18 Transboundary Ramsar Sites, and 15 Ramsar Regional Initiatives covering regions of the Mediterranean, Asia, Africa and South America.

=== International organization partners ===
The Ramsar Convention works closely with six other organisations known as International Organization Partners (IOPs). These are:
* [[BirdLife International|Birdlife International]]
* [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN)
* [[International Water Management Institute]] (IWMI)
* [[Wetlands International]]
* [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF International]]
* [[Wildfowl &amp; Wetlands Trust]] (WWT)
These organizations support the work of the Convention by providing expert technical advice, helping implement field studies, and providing financial support. The IOPs also participate regularly as observers in all meetings of the Conference of the Parties and as full members of the Scientific and Technical Review Panel.

=== Other partners ===
The Convention collaborates with a network of partners:
* Biodiversity-related conventions including the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] (CBD), the [[United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification|Convention to Combat Desertification]] (UNCCD), [[Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals|Convention on Migratory Species (CMS)]], the [[World Heritage Convention]] (WHC), and the [[CITES|Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species]] (CITES);
* Project funding bodies including global environmental funds, multilateral development banks and bilateral donors;
* UN agencies such as [[United Nations Environment Programme|UNEP]], [[United Nations Development Programme|UNDP]], [[UNESCO]] and the UN Economic Commission for Europe, and specific programmes such as UNESCO’s Man and the Biosphere (MAB) programme;
* Non-governmental organizations including the [[The Nature Conservancy|Nature Conservancy]], [[Conservation International]], the Society of Wetland Scientists, the International Association for Impact Assessment, and many others;
* Since 1998 the Convention has also benefited from a strong partnership with the [[Danone|Danone Group]] including the [[Evian]] brand, and since 2007 from the Biosphere Connections partnership with the [[Star Alliance]] airline network.

== Bodies established by the Convention ==

;Conference of the Parties (COP)

Conference of the Parties (COP) is the Convention's governing body consisting of all governments that have ratified the treaty. This ultimate authority reviews progress under the Convention, identifies new priorities, and sets work plans for members. The COP can also make amendments to the Convention, create expert advisory bodies, review progress reports by member nations, and collaborate with other international organizations and agreements.

;The Standing Committee

The Standing Committee is the intersessional executive body which represents the COP between its triennial meetings, within the framework of the decisions made by the COP. The Contracting Parties that are members of the Standing Committee are elected by each meeting of the COP to serve for the three years until the next one.
[[File:Ramsar Convention.jpg|thumb|The Ramsar Secretariat offices in Gland, Switzerland]]
'''The Scientific and Technical Review Panel (STRP)'''

The Scientific and Technical Review Panel provides scientific and technical guidance to the Conference of the Parties, the Standing Committee, and the Ramsar Secretariat.

;The Secretariat

The Secretariat carries out the day-to-day coordination of the Convention’s activities. It is based at the headquarters of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in [[Gland, Switzerland]].

The implementation of the Ramsar Convention is a continuing partnership between the Contracting Parties, the Standing Committee, and the Convention Secretariat, with the advice of the subsidiary expert body, the Scientific and Technical Review Panel (STRP), and the support of the International Organization Partners (IOPs).

[[Martha Rojas Urrego]] is the sixth Secretary General of the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands.

== World Wetlands Day ==
[[File:World Wetlands Day.jpg|thumb|A wetland clean-up in Oman on World Wetlands Day]] {{Main|World Wetlands Day}}
The '''2nd of February''' each year is World Wetlands Day, marking the date of the adoption of the Convention on Wetlands on 2 February 1971. Established to raise awareness about the value of wetlands for humanity and the planet, WWD was celebrated for the first time in 1997 and has grown remarkably since then. In 2015 World Wetlands Day was celebrated in 59 countries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9454">In [[United States Constitution|U.S. constitutional law]], '''rational basis review''' is the normal [[standard of review]] that courts apply when considering constitutional questions, including [[Due Process of Law|due process]] or [[Equal Protection|equal protection]] questions under the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] or [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]. Courts applying rational basis review seek to determine whether a law  is "rationally related" to a "legitimate"  government interest, whether real or hypothetical.&lt;ref name="law.cornell"&gt;"[https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/rational_basis Rational Basis.]" Cornell University Law School. Web. 26 Aug. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The higher levels of scrutiny are [[intermediate scrutiny]] and [[strict scrutiny]]. Heightened scrutiny is applied where a [[suspect classification|suspect or quasi-suspect classification]] is involved, or a [[Fundamental right#American Constitutional Law|fundamental right]] is implicated.&lt;ref name="law.cornell" /&gt;

In United States Supreme Court jurisprudence, the nature of the interest at issue determines the level of scrutiny applied by appellate courts. When courts engage in rational basis review, only the most egregious enactments, those not rationally related to a legitimate government interest, are overturned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Mayo v. Wisconsin Injured Patients &amp; Families Compensation Fund, 2018 WI 78, ___ Wis. 2d ___, ___ NW2d ___, |pages=78 |date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Rational+Basis+Test Rational Basis Test.]" The Free Dictionary. Farlex. Web. 26 Aug. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Indest, Miles O. "Walking Dead: The Fifth Circuit Resurrects Rational Basis Review." ''Tulane Law Review'' 88.5 (2014): 993-1005. Web. 26 Aug. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Rational basis review tests whether the government's actions are "rationally related" to a "legitimate" government interest.&lt;ref&gt;''[[United States v. Carolene Products Co.]]'', 304 U.S. 144 (1938).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/emma-rubysachs/equal-potection-in-florid_b_147325.html |work=Huffington Post |title=Equal Protection in Florida |date=December 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court has never set forth standards for determining what constitutes a legitimate government interest.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Nollan v. California Coastal Commission]]'', 483 U.S. 825, 834 (1987)&lt;/ref&gt; Under rational basis review, it is "entirely irrelevant" what end the government is actually seeking and statutes can be based on "rational speculation unsupported by evidence or empirical data."&lt;ref&gt;''FCC v. Beach Communications, Inc''. 508 U.S. 307, 315 (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, if the court can merely hypothesize a "legitimate" interest served by the challenged action, it will withstand rational basis review.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, Kathleen M. &amp; Gunther Gerald. ''Constitutional Law''. Foundation Press, New York, NY. 16th Ed. Chapter 9 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; Judges following the Supreme Court's instructions understand themselves to be "obligated to seek out other conceivable reasons for validating" challenged laws if the government is unable to justify its own policies.&lt;ref&gt;''Starlight Sugar, Inc. v. Soto'', 253 F.3d 137, 146 (1st Cir.2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The concept of rational basis review can be traced to an influential 1893 article, "The Origin and Scope of American Constitutional Law," by Harvard law professor [[James Bradley Thayer]]. Thayer argued that statutes should be invalidated only if their unconstitutionality is "so clear that it is not open to rational question."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Posner |first1=Richard A.|title=The Rise and Fall of Judicial Self-Restraint|journal=California Law Review|date=2012|volume=100|issue=3|pages=519, 522|url=http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&amp;context=californialawreview|accessdate=February 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]], a student of Thayer's, articulated a version of what would become rational basis review in his canonical dissent in ''[[Lochner v. New York]]'', arguing that "the word 'liberty,' in the 14th Amendment, is perverted when it is held to prevent the natural outcome of a dominant opinion, unless it can be said that a rational and fair man necessarily would admit that the statute proposed would infringe fundamental principles as they have been understood by the traditions of our people and our law."

However, the court's extensive application of economic substantive due process during [[Lochner era|the years following Lochner]] meant that Holmes' proposed doctrine of judicial deference to state interest was not immediately adopted.&lt;ref&gt;Indest, Miles O. "Walking Dead: The Fifth Circuit Resurrects Rational Basis Review." ''Tulane Law Review'' 88.5 (2014): 993–1005. Web. 26 Aug. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until ''[[Nebbia v. New York]]'' that the Court began to formally apply rational basis review, when it stated that "a State is free to adopt whatever economic policy may reasonably be deemed to promote public welfare, and to enforce that policy by legislation adapted to its purpose." In ''[[United States v. Carolene Products Co.]]'' the Court in [[Footnote Four]] left open the possibility that laws that seem to be within "a specific prohibition of the Constitution," which restrict the political process, or which burden "[[discrete and insular minorities]]" might receive more exacting review. Today, such laws receive [[strict scrutiny]], whereas laws implicating  [[unenumerated rights]] that the Supreme Court has not recognized as [[fundamental rights|fundamental]] receive rational basis review.

==Applicability==
In modern constitutional law, the rational basis test is applied to constitutional challenges of both [[federal law]] and [[state law]] (via the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]).  This test also applies to both [[legislature|legislative]] and [[Executive (government)|executive]] action whether those actions be of a [[substantive due process|substantive]] or [[procedural due process|procedural]] nature.

The rational basis test prohibits the government from imposing restrictions on liberty that are irrational or arbitrary, or drawing distinctions between persons in a manner that serves no constitutionally legitimate end.&lt;ref&gt;Killian, Johnny H., George A. Costello, &amp; Kenneth R. Thomas, co-eds., ''The Constitution of the United States of America: Analysis and Interpretation: Analysis of Cases Decided by the Supreme Court of the United States to June 28, 2002'', by [[Congressional Research Service]], [[Library of Congress]] (Senate Document No. 108-17, 108th Congress, 2d Session) (Washington [D.C.]: U.S. Gov't Printing Ofc. 2004) (short title: ''[[Congressional Research Service reports#How to access CRS Reports|Constitution Annotated]]''), pp. 1906–1910 (pp. 242–246 per Adobe Acrobat Reader) ([http://www.gpoaccess.gov/constitution/pdf2002/032.pdf ''Fourteenth Amendment''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100810025118/http://www.gpoaccess.gov//constitution/pdf2002/032.pdf |date=2010-08-10 }}, [http://www.gpoaccess.gov/constitution/pdf2002/001-Title.pdf title page (p. [I&amp;#93; (p. 1 per Adobe Acrobat Reader))] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100331232402/http://www.gpoaccess.gov/constitution/pdf2002/001-Title.pdf |date=2010-03-31 }}, and [http://www.gpoaccess.gov/constitution/pdf2002/002-Authorization.pdf ''Authorization'' (authorization to publish by joint resolution) (giving short title) (p. III) (p. 1 per Adobe Acrobat Reader)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100810024512/http://www.gpoaccess.gov//constitution/pdf2002/002-Authorization.pdf |date=2010-08-10 }}, all as accessed October 23, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; While a "law enacted for broad and ambitious purposes often can be explained by reference to legitimate public policies which justify the incidental disadvantages they impose on certain persons", it must nevertheless, at least, "bear a rational relationship to a legitimate governmental purpose".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Romer v. Evans]]'', 517 U.S. 620 (1996) at 635&lt;/ref&gt;

To understand the concept of rational basis review, it is easier to understand what it is not. Rational basis review is ''not'' a genuine effort to determine the legislature's actual reasons for enacting a statute, nor to inquire into whether a statute does in fact further a legitimate end of government. A court applying rational basis review will virtually always uphold a challenged law unless every conceivable justification for it is a grossly illogical non sequitur. In 2008, Justice [[John Paul Stevens]] reaffirmed the lenient nature of rational basis review in a [[concurring opinion]]: "[A]s I recall my esteemed former colleague, [[Thurgood Marshall]], remarking on numerous occasions: 'The Constitution does not prohibit legislatures from enacting stupid laws.'"&lt;ref&gt;''New York State Bd. of Elections v. Lopez Torres'', 552 U.S. 196, ___ (2008) (Stevens, J., concurring).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Initial reference==

The Court of Appeal was asked by the Government of Quebec to answer the following question:

{{Cquote|
Are sections 8 to 19, 40 to 53, 60, 61 and 68 of the ''Assisted Human Reproduction Act'', S.C. 2004, c.2, ''ultra vires'' the Parliament of Canada in whole or in part under the ''Constitution Act, 1867''?
|100%|cquote}}

The Court ruled in the affirmative in some respects of the question.

==Appeal to the Supreme Court==

The appeal was allowed in part, with the Court rendering a rare 4-4-1 mixed decision. The justices' opinions were as follows:

:{{Color box|lightgreen|border=darkgray}} = constitutionally valid
:{{Color box|lightblue|border=darkgray}} = constitutional to the extent that they relate to constitutionally valid provisions

===The McLachlin opinion===

The Act is essentially a series of prohibitions, followed by a set of subsidiary provisions for their administration.  While the Act will have beneficial effects and while some of its effects may impact on provincial matters, neither its dominant purpose nor its dominant effect is to set up a regime that regulates and promotes the benefits of artificial reproduction. Here, the matter of the statutory scheme, viewed as a whole, is a valid exercise of the federal power over criminal law.  The dominant purpose and effect of the legislative scheme is to prohibit practices that would undercut moral values, produce public health evils, and threaten the security of donors, donees, and persons conceived by assisted reproduction.

===The LeBel/Deschamps opinion===

The impugned provisions represent an overflow of the exercise of the federal [[criminal law power]].  Their [[pith and substance]] is connected with the provinces’ exclusive jurisdiction over hospitals, [[property and civil rights]], and matters of a merely local nature.  The impugned provisions affect rules with respect to the management of hospitals, since Parliament has provided that the Act applies to all premises in which controlled activities are undertaken. Furthermore, the fact that several of the impugned provisions concern subjects that are already governed by the [[Civil Code of Quebec]] and other Quebec legislation is an important indication that in pith and substance, the provisions lie at the very core of the provinces’ jurisdiction over civil rights and local matters.

===The Cromwell opinion===

The matter of the impugned provisions is regulation of virtually every aspect of research and clinical practice in relation to assisted human reproduction.  The matter of the challenged provisions is best classified as relating to the establishment, maintenance and management of hospitals, property and civil rights in the province and matters of a merely local or private nature in the province. However, ss. 8, 9 and 12 in purpose and effect prohibit negative practices associated with assisted reproduction and fall within the traditional ambit of the federal criminal law power.  Similarly, ss. 40(1), (6) and (7), 41 to 43, and 44(1) and (4) set up the mechanisms to implement s. 12 and, to the extent that they relate to provisions of the Act which are constitutional, were properly enacted by Parliament.  Sections 45 to 53, to the extent that they deal with inspection and enforcement in relation to constitutionally valid provisions of the Act, are also properly enacted under the criminal law power.  The same is true for ss. 60 and 61, which create offences.  Section 68 is also constitutional, although its operation will be limited to constitutional sections of the Act.  Given that the other provisions establishing the Assisted Human Reproduction Agency of Canada are not contested, there is no constitutional objection to s. 19.

[[USA PATRIOT Act, Title II|Title II: Enhanced Surveillance Procedures]] gave increased powers of [[surveillance]] to various government agencies and bodies. This title has 25 sections, with one of the sections (section 224) containing a [[sunset clause]] which sets an expiration date, 31 December 2005, for most of the title's provisions. On 22 December 2005, the sunset clause expiration date was extended to 3 February 2006.

Title II contains many of the most contentious provisions of the act.  Supporters of the Patriot Act claim that these provisions are necessary in fighting the [[War on Terrorism]], while its detractors argue that many of the sections of Title II infringe upon [[individual rights|individual]] and [[civil rights]].

The sections of Title II amend the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act]] of 1978 and its provisions in [[United States Code|18 U.S.C.]], dealing with "[[Crimes]] and [[Criminal Procedure]]".  It also amends the [[Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986]].  In general, the Title expands federal agencies' powers in intercepting, sharing, and using private [[telecommunications]], especially electronic communications, along with a focus on criminal investigations by updating the rules that govern computer crime investigations.  It also sets out procedures and limitations for individuals who feel their rights have been violated to seek redress, including against the United States government. However, it also includes a section that deals with [[trade sanction]]s against countries whose government supports terrorism, which is not directly related to surveillance issues.

== Sections 201 &amp; 202: Intercepting communications ==
{{Patriot Act titles}}
Two sections dealt with the interception of communications by the United States government.

Section 201 is titled ''Authority to intercept wire, oral, and electronic communications relating to terrorism''. This section amended {{usc|18|2516}} (Authorization for interception of wire, oral, or electronic communications) of the  [[United States Code]]. This section allows (under certain specific conditions) the [[United States Attorney General]] (or some of his subordinates) to authorize a [[United States Federal Court|Federal judge]] to make an order authorizing or approving the interception of wire or oral communications by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), or another relevant U.S. Federal agency.

The Attorney General's subordinates who can use Section 201 are: the Deputy Attorney General, the Associate Attorney General, any Assistant Attorney General, any acting Assistant Attorney General, any Deputy Assistant Attorney General or acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the Criminal Division who is specially designated by the Attorney General.

The amendment added a further condition which allowed an interception order to be carried out. The interception order may now be made if a criminal violation is made with respect to [[terrorism]] (defined by {{usc|18|2332}}):
* the use of [[weapons of mass destruction]] (defined by {{usc|18|2332a}}), or
* providing financial aid to facilitate acts of terrorism (defined by {{usc|18|2332d}}), or
* [[providing material support to terrorists]] (defined by {{usc|18|2339A}}), or
* Providing material support or resources to designated foreign [[List of designated terrorist groups|terrorist groups]] (defined by {{usc|18|2339B}}).

Note: the legislation states that title 18, section 2516(1), paragraph (p) of the United States Code was redesignated (moved) to become paragraph (q). This paragraph had been previously redesignated by two other pieces of legislation: the [[Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996]]&lt;ref name=AEDPA1996&gt;See [[Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996]], [http://usinfo.state.gov/usa/infousa/laws/majorlaw/s735.htm section 434(2)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060129020009/http://usinfo.state.gov/usa/infousa/laws/majorlaw/s735.htm |date=January 29, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the [[Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996]] (see section 201(3)).&lt;ref name=EPIC201&gt;See also: Charles Doyle (December 10, 2001), [http://www.epic.org/privacy/terrorism/usapatriot/RL31200.pdf Terrorism: Section by Section Analysis of the USA PATRIOT Act], "Section 201.

Section 202 is titled ''Authority to intercept wire, oral, and electronic communications relating to computer fraud and abuse offenses'', and amended the United States Code to include computer fraud and abuse in the list of reasons why an interception order may be granted.&lt;ref name=18USC2516-1c&gt;{{usc-clause|18|2516|(1)(c)}} — [[computer crime]] is a felony violation of {{usc|18|1030}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SeeAlso202&gt;See also: Charles Doyle (December 10, 2001), [http://www.epic.org/privacy/terrorism/usapatriot/RL31200.pdf Terrorism: Section by Section Analysis of the USA PATRIOT Act], "Section 202.

== Section 203: Authority to share criminal investigative information ==
Section 203 (''Authority to share criminal investigation information'') modified the [[Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure]] with respect to disclosure of information before the [[grand jury]] (Rule 6(e)). Section 203(a) allowed the disclosure of matters in deliberation by the grand jury, which are normally otherwise prohibited, if:
* a court orders it (before or during a judicial proceeding),
* a court finds that there are grounds for a motion to dismiss an [[indictment]] because of matters before the Grand Jury,
* if the matters in deliberation are made by an attorney for the government to another Federal grand jury,
* an attorney for the government requests that matters before the grand jury may reveal a violation of State criminal law,
* the matters involve foreign intelligence or counterintelligence or foreign intelligence information. Foreign intelligence and counterintelligence was defined in section 3 of the [[National Security Act of 1947]],&lt;ref name=50USC401a&gt;{{usc|20|401a}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "foreign intelligence information" was further defined in the amendment as information about:
*# an actual or potential attack or other grave hostile acts of a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power;
*# sabotage or international terrorism by a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power; or
*# clandestine intelligence activities by an intelligence service or network of a foreign power or by an agent of foreign power; or
*# information about a foreign power or foreign territory that relates to the national defense or the security of the United States or the conduct of the foreign affairs of the United States.'.
*# information about non-U.S. ''and'' U.S. citizens
203(a) gave the court the power to order a time within which information may be disclosed, and specified when a government agency may use information disclosed about a foreign power. The rules of criminal procedure now state that "within a reasonable time after such disclosure, an attorney for the government shall file under seal a notice with the court stating the fact that such information was disclosed and the departments, agencies, or entities to which the disclosure was made."

Section 203(b) modified {{usc|18|2517}}, which details who is allowed to learn the results of a communications interception, to allow any investigative or law enforcement officer, or attorney for the Government to divulge foreign intelligence, counterintelligence or foreign intelligence information to a variety of Federal officials.  Specifically,  any official who has obtained knowledge of the contents of any wire, oral, or electronic communication, or evidence derived from this could divulge this information to any Federal law enforcement, intelligence, protective, immigration, national defense, or national security official. The definition of "foreign intelligence" was the same as section 203(a), with the same ability to define "foreign intelligence" to be intelligence of a non-U.S. and U.S. citizen. The information received must only be used as necessary in the conduct of the official's official duties.&lt;ref name=18USC2517&gt;{{usc|18|2517}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition of "foreign intelligence information" is defined again in Section 203(d).

Section 203(c) specified that the Attorney General must establish procedures for the disclosure of information due to {{usc|18|2517}} (see above), for those people who are defined as U.S. citizens.&lt;ref name=SeeAlso203&gt;See also: Charles Doyle (December 10, 2001), [http://www.epic.org/privacy/terrorism/usapatriot/RL31200.pdf Terrorism: Section by Section Analysis of the USA PATRIOT Act], "Section 203.

== Section 204: Limitations on communication interceptions ==
Section 204 (''Clarification of intelligence exceptions from limitations on interception and disclosure of wire, oral, and electronic communication'') removed restrictions from the acquisition of foreign intelligence information from international or foreign communications. It was also clarified that the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978]] should not only be the sole means of electronic surveillance for just oral and wire intercepts, but should also include electronic communication.&lt;ref name=18USC25112f&gt;{{usc-clause|18|2511|(2)(f)}} was amended to allow this change&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SeeAlso204&gt;See also: Charles Doyle (December 10, 2001), [http://www.epic.org/privacy/terrorism/usapatriot/RL31200.pdf Terrorism: Section by Section Analysis of the USA PATRIOT Act], "Section 204.

Interception and Disclosure of Wire, Oral and Electronic Communications.", page 9 &amp; Patrick Leahy, [http://leahy.senate.gov/press/200110/102401a.html Section-by-Section Analysis] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213025652/http://leahy.senate.gov/press/200110/102401a.html |date=February 13, 2010 }}, "Sec. 204."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Section 205: Employment of translators by the FBI ==
Under section 205 (''Employment of translators by the Federal Bureau of Investigation''), the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation is now allowed to employ translators to support counterterrorism investigations and operations without regard to applicable Federal personnel requirements and limitations. However, he must report to the [[House Judiciary Committee]] and [[Senate Judiciary Committee]] the number of translators employed and any legal reasons why he cannot employ translators from federal, state, or local agencies.&lt;ref name=SeeAlso205&gt;See also: Charles Doyle (December 10, 2001), [http://www.epic.org/privacy/terrorism/usapatriot/RL31200.pdf Terrorism: Section by Section Analysis of the USA PATRIOT Act], "Section 205. Employment of Translators by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.", page 9 &amp; Patrick Leahy, [http://leahy.senate.gov/press/200110/102401a.html Section-by-Section Analysis] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213025652/http://leahy.senate.gov/press/200110/102401a.html |date=February 13, 2010 }}, "Sec. 205."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Section 206: Roving surveillance authority ==
The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978&lt;ref name=FISA105c2b&gt;{{usc-clause|50|1805|(c)(2)(B)}}&lt;/ref&gt; allows an applicant access to all information, facilities, or technical assistance necessary to perform electronic surveillance on a particular target. The assistance given must protect the secrecy of and cause as little disruption to the ongoing surveillance effort as possible. The direction could be made at the request of the applicant of the surveillance order, by a [[common carrier]], landlord, custodian or other specified person. Section 206 (''Roving surveillance authority under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978'') amended this to add:

&lt;blockquote&gt;or in circumstances where the Court finds that the actions of the target of the application may have the effect of thwarting the identification of a particular person.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This allows intelligence agencies to undertake "roving" surveillance: they do not have to specify the exact facility or location where their surveillance will be done. Roving surveillance was already specified for criminal investigations under {{usc-clause|18|2518|(11)}}, and section 206 brought the ability of intelligence agencies to undertake such roving surveillance into line with such criminal investigations. However, the section was not without controversy, as James X. Dempsey, the Executive Director of the [[Center for Democracy &amp; Technology]], argued that a few months after the Patriot Act was passed the Intelligence Authorization Act was also passed that had the unintended effect of seeming to authorize "John Doe" roving taps — FISA orders that identify neither the target nor the location of the interception (see [[#Section 206|The Patriot Debates, James X. Dempsey debates Paul Rosenzweig on section 206]]).&lt;ref name=SeeAlso206&gt;See also: Charles Doyle (December 10, 2001), [http://www.epic.org/privacy/terrorism/usapatriot/RL31200.pdf Terrorism: Section by Section Analysis of the USA PATRIOT Act], "Section 206.

Surveillance Act of 1978.", page 10 &amp; Patrick Leahy, [http://leahy.senate.gov/press/200110/102401a.html Section-by-Section Analysis] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213025652/http://leahy.senate.gov/press/200110/102401a.html |date=February 13, 2010 }}, "Sec. 206."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Section 207: Duration of FISA surveillance on agents of a foreign power ==
Previously FISA only defined the duration of a surveillance order against a foreign power (defined in {{usc-clause|50|1805|(e)(1)}}) . This was amended by section 207 (''Duration of FISA surveillance of non-United States persons who are agents of a foreign power'') to allow surveillance of agents of a foreign power (as defined in section {{usc-clause|50|1801|(b)(1)(A)}}) for a maximum of 90 days. Section 304(d)(1) was also amended to extend orders for [[physical search]]es from 45 days to 90 days, and orders for physical searches against agents of a foreign power are allowed for a maximum of 120 days. The act also clarified that extensions for surveillance could be granted for a maximum of a year against agents of a foreign power.&lt;ref name=SeeAlso207&gt;See also: Charles Doyle (December 10, 2001), [http://www.epic.org/privacy/terrorism/usapatriot/RL31200.pdf Terrorism: Section by Section Analysis of the USA PATRIOT Act], "Section 207.

== Section 208: Designation of judges ==
Section 103(A) of FISA was amended by Section 208 (''Designation of judges'') of the Patriot Act to increase the number of [[United States district court|federal district court]] judges who must now review surveillance orders from seven to 11. Of these, three of the judges must live within {{convert|20|mi|km}} of the [[District of Columbia]].&lt;ref name=SeeAlso208&gt;See also: Charles Doyle (December 10, 2001), [http://www.epic.org/privacy/terrorism/usapatriot/RL31200.pdf Terrorism: Section by Section Analysis of the USA PATRIOT Act], "Section 208.

== Section 209: Seizure of voice-mail messages pursuant to warrants ==
Section 209 (''Seizure of voice-mail messages pursuant to warrants'') removed the text "any electronic storage of such communication" from title 18, section 2510 of the United States Code. Before this was struck from the Code, the U.S. government needed to apply for a title III wiretap order&lt;ref name=TitleIIIWiretap&gt;A "Title III wiretap" is shorthand for Title III of the [[Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968]], which deals with [[wiretaps]] and was the law that created Title 18, chapter 19 of the [[United States Code]] (entitled "Wire Interception and Interception of Oral Communications," it includes {{usc|18|2510}}—{{usc|18|2520}})&lt;/ref&gt; before they could open [[voice-mail]]s; however, now the government only need apply for an ordinary search. Section 2703, which specifies when a "provider of electronic communication services" must disclose the contents of stored communications, was also amended to allow such a provider to be compelled to disclose the contents via a search warrant, and not a wiretap order. According to [[Vermont]] senator [[Patrick Leahy]], this was done to "harmonizing the rules applicable to stored voice and non-voice (e.g., e-mail) communications".&lt;ref name=LeahySec209&gt;[[Patrick Leahy]], section by section analysis of the USA PATRIOT Act, [http://leahy.senate.gov/press/200110/102401a.html section 209] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213025652/http://leahy.senate.gov/press/200110/102401a.html |date=February 13, 2010 }}.

Seizure of voice-mail messages pursuant to warrants", page 11&lt;/ref&gt;

== Section 210 &amp; 211: Scope of subpoenas for records of electronic communications ==
The U.S. Code specifies when the U.S. government may require a provider of an electronic communication service to hand over communication records.&lt;ref name=18USC2703&gt;{{usc|18|2703}}&lt;/ref&gt; It specifies what that provider must disclose to the government,&lt;ref name=18USC2703-c2&gt;{{usc-clause|18|2703|(c)(2)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was amended by section 210 (''Scope of subpoenas for records of electronic communications'') to include records of session times and durations of electronic communication as well as any identifying numbers or addresses of the equipment that was being used, even if this may only be temporary. For instance, this would include temporarily assigned [[IP address]]es, such as those established by [[DHCP]].&lt;ref name=SeeAlso210&gt;See also: Charles Doyle (December 10, 2001), [http://www.epic.org/privacy/terrorism/usapatriot/RL31200.pdf Terrorism: Section by Section Analysis of the USA PATRIOT Act], "Scope of subpoenas for records of electronic communications", page 11 &amp; Patrick Leahy, [http://leahy.senate.gov/press/200110/102401a.html Section-by-Section Analysis] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213025652/http://leahy.senate.gov/press/200110/102401a.html |date=February 13, 2010 }}, "Sec. 210."&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 211 (''Clarification of scope'') further clarified the scope of such orders. {{usc|47|551}}  (Section 631 of the [[Communications Act of 1934]]) deals with the privacy granted to users of [[cable TV]]. The code was amended to allow the government to have access to the records of cable customers, with the notable exclusion of records revealing cable subscriber selection of video programming from a cable operator.&lt;ref name=SeeAlso211&gt;See also: Charles Doyle (December 10, 2001), [http://www.epic.org/privacy/terrorism/usapatriot/RL31200.pdf Terrorism: Section by Section Analysis of the USA PATRIOT Act], "Clarification of scope", page 11 &amp; Patrick Leahy, [http://leahy.senate.gov/press/200110/102401a.html Section-by-Section Analysis] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213025652/http://leahy.senate.gov/press/200110/102401a.html |date=February 13, 2010 }}, "Sec. 211."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Section 212: Emergency disclosure of electronic communications ==
Section 212 (''Emergency disclosure of electronic communications to protect life and limb'') amended the US Code to stop a communications provider from providing communication records (not necessarily relating to the content itself) about a customer's communications to others.&lt;ref name=18USC2702-a3&gt;{{usc-clause|18|2702|(a)(3)}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, should the provider reasonably believe that an emergency involving immediate danger of [[death]] or serious [[physical injury]] to any person then the communications provider can now disclose this information. The act did not make clear what "reasonably" meant.

A communications provider could also disclose communications records if:
* a court orders the disclosure of communications at the request of a government agency ({{usc|18|2703}})
* the customer allows the information to be disclosed
* if the service provider believes that they must do so to protect their rights or property.

This section was repealed by the [[Homeland Security Act of 2002]] — this act also created the [[Homeland Security Department]] — and was replaced with a new and permanent emergency disclosure provision.&lt;ref name=SeeAlso212&gt;See also: Charles Doyle (December 10, 2001), [http://www.epic.org/privacy/terrorism/usapatriot/RL31200.pdf Terrorism: Section by Section Analysis of the USA PATRIOT Act], "Emergency disclosure of electronic communications to protect life and limb", page 12 &amp; Patrick Leahy, [http://leahy.senate.gov/press/200110/102401a.html Section-by-Section Analysis] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213025652/http://leahy.senate.gov/press/200110/102401a.html |date=February 13, 2010 }}, "Sec. 212."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Section 213: Delayed search warrant notification ==
Section 213 (''Authority for delaying notice of the execution of a warrant'') amended the US Code to allow the notification of [[search warrants]]&lt;ref name=18USC3103a-a&gt;{{usc-clause|18|3103a|(a)}} states that "a warrant may be issued to search for and seize any property that constitutes evidence of a criminal offense in violation of the laws of the United States"&lt;/ref&gt; to be delayed.&lt;ref name=18USC3103a&gt;{{usc|18|3103a}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This section has been commonly referred to as the "sneak and peek" section, a phrase originating from the FBI{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} and not, as commonly believed, from opponents of the Patriot Act. The U.S. government may now legally search and seize property that constitutes evidence of a United States criminal offense without immediately telling the owner. The court may only order the delayed notification if they have reason to believe it would hurt an investigation — delayed notifications were already defined in {{usc|18|2705}} — or, if a search warrant specified that the subject of the warrant must be notified "within a reasonable period of its execution," then it allows the court to extend the period before the notification is given, though the government must show "good cause". If the search warrant prohibited the seizure of property or communications, then the search warrant could then be delayed.

Before the Patriot Act was enacted, there were three cases before the [[United States district court]]s: ''[[United States v. Freitas]]'', 800 F.2d 1451 (9th Cir. 1986); ''[[United States v. Villegas]]'', 899 F.2d 1324 (2d Cir. 1990); and ''[[United States v. Simons]]'', 206 F.3d 392 (4th Cir. 2000). Each determined that, under certain circumstances, it was not [[United States Constitution|unconstitutional]] to delay the notification of search warrants.&lt;ref name=SeeAlso213&gt;For some analysis of section 213 of the PATRIOT Act, see: Charles Doyle (December 10, 2001), [http://www.epic.org/privacy/terrorism/usapatriot/RL31200.pdf Terrorism: Section by Section Analysis of the USA PATRIOT Act], "Section 213: Authority for delaying notice of the execution of a warrant", page 12 &amp; Patrick Leahy, [http://leahy.senate.gov/press/200110/102401a.html Section-by-Section Analysis] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213025652/http://leahy.senate.gov/press/200110/102401a.html |date=February 13, 2010 }}, "Sec. 213."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Section 214: Pen register and trap and trace authority ==
FISA was amended by section 214 (''[[Pen register]] and trap and trace authority under FISA'') to clarify that pen register and trap and trace surveillance can be authorised to allow government agencies to gather foreign intelligence information.&lt;ref name=FISA402-403&gt;Section 402 of FISA ({{usc|50|1842}}) and Section 403 of FISA ({{usc|50|1843}}) were both amended&lt;/ref&gt; Where the law only allowed them to gather surveillance if there was evidence of international terrorism, it now gives the courts the power to grant trap and traces against:
* non-U.S. citizens.
* those suspected of being involved with international terrorism,
* those undertaking clandestine intelligence activities

Any investigation against U.S. citizens must not violate the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]].&lt;ref name=SeeAlso214&gt;See also: Charles Doyle (December 10, 2001), [http://www.epic.org/privacy/terrorism/usapatriot/RL31200.pdf Terrorism: Section by Section Analysis of the USA PATRIOT Act], "Section 214: Pen register and trap and trace authority under FISA", page 13 &amp; Patrick Leahy, [http://leahy.senate.gov/press/200110/102401a.html Section-by-Section Analysis] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213025652/http://leahy.senate.gov/press/200110/102401a.html |date=February 13, 2010 }}, "Sec. 214."&lt;/ref&gt;

FISA was modified by section 215 (''Access to records and other items under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act'') of the Act to allow the Director of the FBI (or an official designated by the Director, so long as that official's rank is no lower than Assistant Special Agent in Charge) to apply for an order to produce materials that assist in an investigation undertaken to protect against international terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities. The Act gives an example to clarify what it means by "tangible things": it includes "books, records, papers, documents, and other items".

It is specified that any such investigation must be conducted in accordance with guidelines laid out in [[Executive Order 12333]] (which pertains to United States intelligence activities). Investigations must also not be performed on U.S. citizens who are carrying out activities protected by the [[First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States]].

Any order that is granted must be given by a FISA court judge or by a [[United States magistrate judge|magistrate judge]] who is publicly designated by the [[Chief Justice of the United States]] to allow such an order to be given. Any application must prove that it is being conducted without violating the First Amendment rights of any U.S. citizens. The application can ''only'' be used to obtain foreign intelligence information not concerning a U.S. citizen or to protect against international terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities.

This section of the USA PATRIOT Act is controversial because the order may be granted ''[[ex parte]]'', and once it is granted — in order to avoid jeopardizing the investigation — the order may not disclose the reasons behind why the order was granted.

The section carries a [[gag order]] stating that "No person shall disclose to any other person (other than those persons necessary to produce the tangible things under this section) that the Federal Bureau of Investigation has sought or obtained tangible things under this section". Senator [[Rand Paul]] stated that the non-disclosure is imposed for one year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Paul |first=Rand |title=Senator Rand Paul's Letter of Opposition to the Patriot Act |url=http://paul.senate.gov/record.cfm?id=331164 |accessdate=2011-05-27 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110506033402/http://paul.senate.gov/record.cfm?id=331164 |archivedate=2011-05-06 |date=2011-04-15 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; though this is not explicitly mentioned in the section.

In order to protect anyone who complies with the order, FISA now prevents any person who complies with the order in "[[good faith]]" from being liable for producing any tangible goods required by the court order. The production of tangible items is not deemed to constitute a waiver of any privilege in any other proceeding or context.

As a safeguard, section 502 of FISA compels the Attorney General to inform the [[United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence|Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of Representatives]] and the [[United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence|Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate]] of all such orders granted. In a semi-annual basis, the Attorney General must also provide a report to the [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives]] and the [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Senate]] which details the total number of applications over the previous 6 months made for orders approving requests for the production of tangible things and the total number of such orders either granted, modified, or denied.&lt;ref name=SeeAlso215&gt;See also: Charles Doyle (December 10, 2001), [http://www.epic.org/privacy/terrorism/usapatriot/RL31200.pdf Terrorism: Section by Section Analysis of the USA PATRIOT Act], "Section 215: Access to records and other items under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act", page 14 &amp; Patrick Leahy, [https://web.archive.org/web/20100213025652/http://leahy.senate.gov/press/200110/102401a.html Section-by-Section Analysis], "Sec. 215."&lt;/ref&gt;

This section was [[Patriot Act|reauthorized]] in 2011.

During a House Judiciary hearing on domestic spying on July 17, 2013 John C. Inglis, the deputy director of the surveillance agency, told a member of the House judiciary committee that NSA analysts can perform "a second or third hop query" through its collections of telephone data and internet records in order to find connections to terrorist organizations.&lt;ref name="Guardian20130718" /&gt; "Hops" refers to a technical term indicating connections between people. A three-hop query means that the NSA can look at data not only from a suspected terrorist, but from everyone that suspect communicated with, and then from everyone those people communicated with, and then from everyone all of those people communicated with.&lt;ref name="Guardian20130718"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ackermann|first=Spencer|title=NSA warned to rein in surveillance as agency reveals even greater scope|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/17/nsa-surveillance-house-hearing|accessdate=July 18, 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bump|first=Philip|title=The NSA Admits It Analyzes More People's Data Than Previously Revealed|url=http://www.theatlanticwire.com/politics/2013/07/nsa-admits-it-analyzes-more-peoples-data-previously-revealed/67287/|accessdate=July 18, 2013|newspaper=The Atlantic Wire|date=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; NSA officials had said previously that data mining was limited to two hops, but Inglis suggested that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court has allowed for data analysis extending "two or three hops".&lt;ref name="McClatchy20130717"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/congress/article24751231.html | title=Skeptical Congress turns its spycam on NSA surveillance | work=McClatchyDC | date=17 July 2013 | accessdate=28 March 2016 | author=Watkins, Ali}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in 2015, the Second Circuit appeals court ruled in [[ACLU v. Clapper]] that Section 215 of the Patriot Act did not authorize the bulk collection of phone metadata, which judge [[Gerard E. Lynch]] called a "staggering" amount of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/05/07/us-usa-security-nsa-idUSKBN0NS1IN20150507|title=U.S. NSA domestic phone spying program illegal: appeals court|publisher=Reuters|date=7 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 20, 2015, Paul spoke for ten and a half hours in opposition to the reauthorization of Section 215 of the [[Patriot Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kim|first1=Seung Min|last2=Byers|first2=Alex|title=Rand Paul calls it a night after 10 1/2 hours|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2015/05/rand-paul-filibuster-patriot-act-118141.html|website=Politico|publisher=Politico|accessdate=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At midnight on May 31, 2015, Section 215 expired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kelly|first=Erin|title=Here's what happens when Patriot Act provisions expire tonight|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/05/31/patriot-act-expires-senate-stalemate/28260905/|date=31 May 2015|website=USA Today|accessdate=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With the passage of the [[USA Freedom Act]] on June 2, 2015 the expired parts of law, including Section 215, were reported broadly as restored and renewed through 2019.&lt;ref name=usafreedomact&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/06/02/patriot-act-usa-freedom-act-senate-vote/28345747/|title=Senate approves USA Freedom Act|author=Erin Kelly|publisher=USA Today|date=June 2, 2015|accessdate=June 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; But, the USA Freedom Act did not explicitly state that it was restoring the expired provisions of Section 215.&lt;ref&gt;Public Law No: 114-23 Section 2.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since such renewal language is nowhere to be found, the law [[USA Freedom Act#Title I: FISA Business Records|amended]] the version of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act that existed on October 25, 2001, prior to changes brought by the USA Patriot Act, rendering much of the amendment language incoherent.&lt;ref&gt;http://uscode.house.gov/statviewer.htm?volume=120&amp;page=195&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://uscode.house.gov/statviewer.htm?volume=125&amp;page=216&lt;/ref&gt;  How this legislative snafu will be fixed is not clear.  The attempted amendments to Section 215 were intended to stop the NSA from continuing its mass phone data collection program.&lt;ref name=usafreedomact /&gt; Instead, phone companies will retain the data and the NSA can obtain information about targeted individuals with permission from a federal court.&lt;ref name=usafreedomact /&gt;

== Section 216: Authority to issue pen registers and trap and trace devices ==
Section 216 (''Modification of authorities relating to use of pen registers and trap and trace devices'') deals with three specific areas with regards to [[pen register]]s and [[trap and trace device]]s: general limitations to the use of such devices, how an order allowing the use of such devices must be made, and the definition of such devices.

=== Limitations ===
{{usc|18|3121}} details the exceptions related to the general prohibition on [[pen register]] and [[trap and trace device]]s. Along with gathering information for dialup communications, it allows for gathering [[routing]] and other addressing information. It is specifically limited to this information: the Act does ''not'' allow such surveillance to capture the actual information that is contained in the communication being monitored. However, organisations such as the EFF have pointed out that certain types of information that can be captured, such as [[Uniform Resource Locator|URLs]], can have content embedded in them. They object to the application of trap and trace and pen register devices to newer technology using a standard designed for [[telephone]]s.

=== Making and carrying out orders ===
It also details that an order may be applied for ''[[ex parte]]'' (without the party it is made against present, which in itself is not unusual for search warrants), and allows the agency who applied for the order to compel any relevant person or entity providing wire or electronic communication service to assist with the surveillance. If the party whom the order is made against so requests, the attorney for the Government, law enforcement or investigative officer that is serving the order must provide written or electronic certification that the order applies to the targeted individual.

If a pen register or trap and trace device is used on a [[packet-switched data network]], then the agency doing surveillance must keep a detailed log containing:

# any officer or officers who installed the device and any officer or officers who accessed the device to obtain information from the network;
# the date and time the device was installed, the date and time the device was uninstalled, and the date, time, and duration of each time the device is accessed to obtain information;
# the configuration of the device at the time of its installation and any subsequent modification made to the device; and
# any information which has been collected by the device

This information must be generated for the entire time the device is active, and must be provided ''ex parte'' and under [[seal (device)|seal]] to the court which entered the ''ex parte'' order authorizing the installation and use of the device. This must be done within 30 days after termination of the order.

Orders must now include the following information:&lt;ref name=18USC3123-b1&gt;{{usc-clause|18|3123|(b)(1)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the identifying number of the device under surveillance
* the location of the telephone line or other facility to which the pen register or trap and trace device is to be attached or applied
* if a trap and trace device is installed, the geographic limits of the order must be specified

This section amended the [[non-disclosure]] requirements of {{usc-clause|18|3123|(d)(2)}} by expanding to include those whose facilities are used to establish the trap and trace or pen register or to those people who assist with applying the surveillance order who must not disclose that surveillance is being undertaken. Before this it had only applied to the person owning or leasing the line.

=== Definitions ===
The following terms were redefined in the US Code's [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode18/usc_sup_01_18_10_II_20_206.html chapter 206] (which solely deals with pen registers and trap and trace devices):
* '''Court of competent jurisdiction:''' defined in {{usc-clause|18|3127|(2)}}, subparagraph A was stricken and replaced to redefine the court to be any [[United States district court]] (including a magistrate judge of such a court) or any [[United States court of appeals]] having [[jurisdiction]] over the offense being investigated (title 18 also allows [[United States states|State]] courts that have been given authority by their State to use pen register and trap and trace devices)
* '''Pen register:''' defined in {{usc-clause|18|3127|(3)}}, the definition of such a device was expanded to include a device that captures dialing, [[routing]], addressing, or signaling information from an electronics communication device. It limited the usage of such devices to exclude the capturing of any of the ''contents'' of communications being monitored. {{usc-clause|18|3124|(b)}} was also similarly amended.
* '''Trap and trace device:''' defined in {{usc-clause|18|3127|(4)}}, the definition was similarly expanded to include the dialing, [[routing]], addressing, or signaling information from an electronics communication device. However, a trap and trace device can now also be a "process", not just a device.
* '''Contents:''' {{usc-clause|18|3127|(1)}} clarifies the term "contents" (as referred to in the definition of trap and trace devices and pen registers) to conform to the definition as defined in {{usc-clause|18|2510|(8)}}, which when used with respect to any wire, oral, or electronic communication, includes any information concerning the substance, purport, or meaning of that communication.

== Section 217: Interception of computer trespasser communications ==
Section 217 (''Interception of computer trespasser communications'') firstly defines the following terms:
* '''Protected computer:''' this is defined in {{usc-clause|18|1030|(e)(2)(A)}}, and is any computer that is used by a financial institution or the United States Government or one which is used in interstate or foreign commerce or communication, including a computer located outside the United States that is used in a manner that affects interstate or foreign commerce or communication of the United States.
* '''Computer trespasser:''' this is defined in {{usc-clause|18|2510|(21)}} and references to this phrase means
*# a person who accesses a protected computer without authorization and thus has no [[reasonable expectation of privacy]] in any communication transmitted to, through, or from the protected computer; and
*# does not include a person known by the owner or operator of the protected computer to have an existing contractual relationship with the owner or operator of the protected computer for access to all or part of the protected computer

Amendments were made to {{usc-clause|18|2511|(2)}} to make it lawful to allow a person to intercept the communications of a computer trespasser if
# the owner or operator of the protected computer authorizes the interception of the computer trespasser's communications on the protected computer,
# the person is lawfully engaged in an investigation,
# the person has reasonable grounds to believe that the contents of the computer trespasser's communications will be relevant to their investigation, and
# any communication captured can only relate to those transmitted to or from the computer trespasser.

== Section 218: Foreign intelligence information ==
Section 218 (''Foreign intelligence information'') amended {{usc-clause|50|1804|(a)(6)(B)}} and {{usc-clause|50|1823|(a)(6)(B)}} (both FISA sections 104(a) (7)(B) and section 303(a)(7)(B), respectively) to change "the purpose" of surveillance orders under FISA to gain access to foreign intelligence to "significant purpose". [[Mary DeRosa]], in ''The Patriot Debates'', explained that the reason behind this was to remove a legal "wall" which arose when criminal and foreign intelligence overlapped. This was because the U.S. Department of Justice interpreted "the purpose" of surveillance was restricted to collecting information for foreign intelligence, which DeRosa says "was designed to ensure that prosecutors and criminal investigators did not use FISA to circumvent the more rigorous warrant requirements for criminal cases". However, she also says that it is debatable whether this legal tightening of the definition was even necessary, stating that "the Department of Justice argued to the FISA Court of Review in 2002 that the original FISA standard did not require the restrictions that the Department of Justice imposed over the years, and the court appears to have agreed [which] leaves the precise legal effect of a sunset of section 218 somewhat murky."&lt;ref name="Patriot Debates DeRosa Section 218"&gt;[[Mary DeRosa]] (undated), [https://web.archive.org/web/20050408075649/http://www.patriotdebates.com/218-2#summary "Section 218, amending the FISA Standard, a summary by Mary DeRosa"], ''The Patriot Debates'', accessed January 22, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

== Section 219: Single-jurisdiction search warrants for terrorism ==
Section 219 (''Single-jurisdiction search warrants for terrorism'') amended the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure to allow a magistrate judge who is involved in an investigation of domestic terrorism or international terrorism the ability to issue a warrant for a person or property within or outside of their district.&lt;ref name=FRCP-41-a&gt;[[Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure]], rule 41(a)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Section 220: Nationwide service of search warrants for electronic evidence ==
Section 220 (''Nationwide service of search warrants for electronic evidence'') gives the power to Federal courts to issue nationwide service of search warrants for electronic surveillance. However, only courts with jurisdiction over the offense can order such a warrant. This required amending {{usc|18|2703}} and {{usc|18|2711}}.

== Section 221: Trade sanctions ==
Section 221 (''Trade sanctions'') amended the [[Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000]].&lt;ref name=TradeSanctionsReformAndExportEnhancementAct2000&gt;The ''[[Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000]]'' is defined in [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode22/usc_sup_01_22_10_79.html title 22, chapter 79] of the [[United States Code]]&lt;/ref&gt; This Act prohibits, except under certain specific circumstances, the President from imposing a unilateral agricultural sanction or unilateral medical sanction against a foreign country or foreign entity. The Act holds various exceptions to this prohibition, and the Patriot Act further amended the exceptions to include holding sanctions against countries that design, develop or produce chemical or biological weapons, missiles, or weapons of mass destruction.&lt;ref name=22USC7203-2C&gt;''[[Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000]]'', Title IX, section 904(2)(C); corresponds to {{usc-clause|22|7203|(2)(C)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It also amended the act to include the [[Taliban]] as state sponsors of international terrorism. In amending Title IX, section 906 of the Trade sanctions act, the Taliban was determined by the [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] to have repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism and the export of agricultural commodities, medicine, or medical devices is now pursuant to one-year licenses issued and reviewed by the United States Government.&lt;ref name=22USC7205-A1&gt;''[[Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000]]'', title IX, section 906(A)(1) {{usc-clause|22|7205|(A)(1)}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the export of agricultural commodities, medicine, or medical devices to the [[Government of Syria]] or to the [[Government of North Korea]] were exempt from such a restriction.&lt;ref name=22USC705-A2&gt;''[[Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000]]'', title IX, section 906(A)(2) {{usc-clause|22|7205|(A)(2)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Patriot Act further states that nothing in the Trade Sanctions Act will limit the application of criminal or civil penalties to those who export agricultural commodities, medicine, or medical devices to:
* foreign entities who commit acts of violence to disrupt the [[Middle East peace process]]&lt;ref name=ExecOrder12947&gt;This is defined in [[Executive Order No. 12947]]: "Prohibiting Transactions With Terrorists Who Threaten To Disrupt the Middle East Peace Process"&lt;/ref&gt;
* those deemed to be part of a Foreign Terrorist Organization under the ''[[Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996]]''
* foreign entities or individuals deemed to support terrorist activities&lt;ref name=ExecOrder13224&gt;This is defined in [[Executive Order No. 13224]]: "Blocking Property and Prohibiting Transactions With Persons Who Commit, Threaten to Commit, or Support Terrorism"&lt;/ref&gt;
* any entity that is involved in [[drug trafficking]]&lt;ref name=DrugTrafficking&gt;Defined in [[Executive Order No. 12978]]: "Blocking Assets and Prohibiting Transactions with Significant Narcotics Traffickers"; &amp; the [[Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* any foreign entity or individual who is subject to any restriction for involvement in weapons of mass destruction or missile proliferation.

== Section 222: Assistance to law enforcement agencies ==
Section 222 (''Assistance to law enforcement agencies'') states that nothing in the Patriot Act shall make a communications provider or other individual provide more technical assistance to a law enforcement agency than what is set out in the Act. It also allows for the reasonable compensation of any expenses incurred while assisting with the establishment of pen registers or trap and trace devices.&lt;ref name=compensation&gt;As defined in section 216 of the Patriot Act.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Section 223: Civil liability for certain unauthorized disclosures ==
{{usc-clause|18|2520|(a)}} allows any person who has had their rights violated due to the illegal interception of communications to take civil action against the offending party. Section 223 (''Civil liability for certain unauthorized disclosures'') excluded the United States from such civil action.

If a court or appropriate department or agency determines that the United States or any of its departments or agencies has violated any provision of [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode18/usc_sup_01_18_10_I_20_119.html chapter 119] of the U.S. Code they may request an internal review from that agency or department. If necessary, an employee may then have administrative action taken against them. If the department or agency do not take action, then they must inform the notify the Inspector General who has jurisdiction over the agency or department, and they must give reasons to them why they did not take action.&lt;ref name=AdminAction&gt;Defined in {{usc-clause|18|2520|(f)}} and {{usc-clause|18|2707|(d)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A citizen's rights will also be found to have been violated if an investigative, law enforcement officer or governmental entity discloses information beyond that allowed in {{usc-clause|18|2517|(a)}}.&lt;ref name=Violation&gt;Defined in {{usc-clause|18|2520|(g)}} and {{usc-clause|18|2707|(g)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== U.S. Code Title 18, Section 2712 added ===

A totally new section was appended to Title 18, Chapter 121 of the US Code: Section 2712, "Civil actions against the United States". It allows people to take action against the US Government if they feel that they had their rights violated, as defined in [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode18/usc_sup_01_18_10_I_20_121.html chapter 121], [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode18/usc_sup_01_18_10_I_20_119.html chapter 119], or sections 106(a), 305(a), or 405(a) of FISA. The court may assess damages no less than $US10,000 and [[litigation costs]] that are reasonably incurred. Those seeking damages must present them to the relevant department or agency as specified in the procedures of the [[Federal Tort Claims Act]].

Actions taken against the United States must be initiated within two years of when the claimant has had a reasonable chance to discover the violation. All cases are presented before a judge, not a jury. However, the court will order a [[stay of proceedings]] if they determine that if during the court case [[civil discovery]] will hurt the ability of the government to conduct a related investigation or the prosecution of a related criminal case. If the court orders the stay of proceedings they will extend the time period that a claimant has to take action on a reported violation. However, the government may respond to any action against it by submitting evidence ''ex parte'' in order to avoid disclosing any matter that may adversely affect a related investigation or a related criminal case. The plaintiff is then given an opportunity to make a submission to the court, not ''ex parte'', and the court may request further information from either party.&lt;ref name="50USC1806-f"&gt;{{usc-clause|18|2712|(b)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If a person wishes to discover or obtain applications or orders or other materials relating to electronic surveillance or to discover, obtain, or suppress evidence or information obtained or derived from electronic surveillance under FISA, then the Attorney General may file an [[affidavit]] under oath that disclosure or an [[adversary hearing]] would harm the national security of the United States. In these cases, the court may review ''in camera'' and ''ex parte'' the material relating to the surveillance to make sure that such surveillance was lawfully authorized and conducted. The court may then disclose part of material relating to the surveillance. However, the court is restricted in they may only do this "where such disclosure is necessary to make an accurate determination of the legality of the surveillance".&lt;ref name="50USC1806-f" /&gt; If it then determined that the use of a pen register or trap and trace device was not lawfully authorized or conducted, the result of such surveillance may be suppressed as evidence. However, should the court determine that such surveillance was lawfully authorised and conducted, they may deny the motion of the aggrieved person.&lt;ref name=50USC1845-g&gt;{{usc-clause|50|1845|(g)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is further stated that if a court or appropriate department or agency determines that an officer or employee of the United States willfully or intentionally violated any provision of [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode18/usc_sup_01_18_10_I_20_121.html chapter 121] of the U.S. Code they will request an internal review from that agency or department. If necessary, an employee may then have administrative action taken against them. If the department or agency do not take action, then they must inform the notify the Inspector General who has jurisdiction over the agency or department, and they must give reasons to them why they did not take action. (see&lt;ref name=Violation /&gt; for a similar part of the Act)

== Section 224: Sunset ==

'''The solarCity''' is an energy-saving living district in [[Linz]]-Pichling, [[Austria]], which provides living space for about 4,000 people. The houses were built using a low-energy design. The idea and motivation for providing energy efficient living arrangements stems from the fact that fossil fuels contribute to global warming and that their use should therefore be avoided.&lt;br /&gt;
Planning of the project began in 1992. Since 1999, 1,300 apartments were gradually built during a 6-year period. The total cost of the project amounted to 190 million euros. Nearly two-thirds of which was used for the residential building, and only a third of the total cost was due to infrastructure.

==Infrastructure==
In the centre of the town lie a bank, a supermarket, a tobacconist's and a coffee house. Community issues are being handled by the staff of the district office and the pastoral care/meeting centre. Children are taken care of in the family centre consisting of a kindergarten, a primary school and high school. A nursery will also be built in the future. In the north of solarCity there is also a recreational area. Since September 2005, the solarCity has been connected to the tram network. Using the public transport network it is possible to get to the city centre of Linz in less than 30 minutes.

==Supply and disposal==
===Energy supply===
At least one-third of the hot water used in the solarCity is generated by solar energy. The remaining two-thirds are covered by [[district heating]] (A district heating plant can provide higher efficiencies and better pollution control than localized boilers).

===Sewage water disposal===
The [[wastewater]] will be disposed and treated in the separation system. While [[Gray water]] is locally managed through a sand bed filter planted and then led to a creek in the neighborhood, the black water is processed conventionally using a [[gravity sewer]] of the sewage treatment plant of the city Asten. 
Part of the [[wastewater]] will be separated across special toilets and collected in separate sewers. This nutrient-rich fluid is utilized as fertiliser in agriculture. 
Larger quantities of rain water have special channels or can be fed into the raceway in north of the solarCity.

'''''State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. v. Campbell''''', 538 U.S. 408 (2003), was a case in which the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] held that the [[due process clause]] usually limits [[punitive damage]] awards to less than ten times the size of the [[compensatory damages]] awarded and that punitive damage awards of four times the compensatory damage award is "''close to the line of constitutional impropriety''".&lt;ref name="justia1"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court reached this conclusion applying guideposts first noted in ''[[BMW of North America, Inc. v. Gore]]'', 517 U.S. 559 (1996), requiring courts to consider:

# the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant's misconduct;
# the disparity between the actual or potential harm suffered by the plaintiff and the punitive damages award; and
# the difference between the punitive damages awarded by the jury and the civil penalties authorized or imposed in comparable cases.

==Case history==
===Background===
The matter involved Curtis Campbell, who was insured by [[State Farm]].

In 1981, Campbell caused an accident in which Todd Ospital was killed and Robert G. Slusher was left permanently disabled, a fact confirmed by both witnesses to the accident and investigators.

Notwithstanding the evidence against Campbell, State Farm decided to contest liability and decline the settlement offers from both Slusher and Ospital's estate (both parties were offering to settle for $25,000 each, or $50,000 total, which was the policy limit).  State Farm assured the Campbells that "their assets were safe, that they had no liability for the accident, that [State Farm] would represent their interests, and that they did not need to procure separate counsel."&lt;ref name="justia1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/538/408/case.html |title=State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co. v. Campbell - 538 U.S. 408 (2003) :: Justia US Supreme Court Center |publisher=Supreme.justia.com |date=2002-12-11 |accessdate=2014-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a jury rendered a verdict that Campbell was 100 percent liable for the accident and awarded a judgment of $185,849. 
State Farm refused to pay the excess amount, nor would it post a [[supersedeas bond]] to allow Campbell to appeal the verdict;&lt;ref&gt;Counsel made the following statement to the Campbells, "You may want to put for sale signs on your property to get things moving."&lt;/ref&gt; Campbell obtained his own counsel to appeal the verdict.&lt;ref name="justia1"/&gt;

===Appeals on verdict against Campbell===
While the appeal was pending, in late 1984 the Campbells reached a settlement with Slusher and Ospital's estate, whereby those parties agreed not to seek satisfaction of the judgment against the Campbells, and the Campbells would pursue a bad-faith action against State Farm.  The attorneys for Slusher and Ospital's estate would represent the Campbells in the bad-faith suit and would make all major decisions regarding it.  No settlement would take effect without the approval of Slusher and Ospital's estate, who would receive 90 percent of any verdict against State Farm.

In 1989 the Utah Supreme Court denied Campbell's appeal.  State Farm then paid the entire amount of the judgment including the excess amount.  Nevertheless, the Campbells filed suit against State Farm alleging bad faith, fraud, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.

===Campbell's trial v. State Farm===
Initially the trial court granted summary judgment for State Farm as it had paid the entire amount of the judgment, but the ruling was reversed on appeal.

The [[Utah Supreme Court]] reinstated a $145 million punitive verdict&lt;ref&gt;Campbell v. State Farm Mutual Automotive Insurance Co., 2001 WL 1246676 (Utah 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; against [[State Farm]], noting that an earlier $100 million judgment had gone unreported to State Farm's corporate headquarters, and that the regional vice president had no plans to report the judgment under review, despite the judgment being substantially based on evidence of national corporate policy.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Laycock, "Modern American Remedies: Cases and Materials", Aspen Publishers, Third Edition, pg. 737.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dissents==
Justices [[Antonin Scalia]] and [[Clarence Thomas]] adhered to their previously expressed views that the Due Process Clause and Constitution provide no protection against "excessive" punitive damage awards.

Justice [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]] voted to leave intact the decision of the Utah Supreme Court. She expressed her view that the Supreme Court "has no warrant to reform state law governing awards of punitive damages." Instead, Ginsburg wrote, while "damage-capping ''legislation'' may be altogether fitting and proper" (emphasis added), only "a legislative scheme or a state high court" is "authorized" to institute such a change in the law.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19200">[[Image:SO Flow Chart.JPG|thumb|300px|IRS Supporting Organization Flow Chart]]
A '''supporting organization''', in the United States, is a [[public charity]] that operates under the [[United States|U.S.]] [[Internal Revenue Code]] in [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/509- 26 USCA 509(a)(3)]. A supporting organization either makes grants to, or performs the operations of, a public charity similar to a [[private foundation]].

However, unlike donations to a private foundation, donations to a supporting organization garner the same higher deduction rate as donations to public charities. However, supporting organizations allow less control over the organization to the founders than private foundations. The Internal Revenue Code calls a public charity that relies on a supporting organization a "supported organization".

==History==
The [[Tax Reform Act of 1969]] created private foundations and imposed greater restrictions on this classification, including excise taxes and lower donor deductions for contributions.&lt;ref&gt;Tax Reform Act of 1969, Pub. L. No. 91-172, 83 Stat. 487&lt;/ref&gt; This Act created supporting organizations as an exception to private foundations—because they are organized, operated, and controlled in the public interest.&lt;ref&gt;Tax Reform Act of 1969: Hearings on HR 13270 Before the House Comm. on Fin., 91st Congress 115-43, 34 (1969)&lt;/ref&gt; Supporting organizations are not subject to the problems and abuses found in foundations that led to the creation and associated restrictions on private foundations.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Rambler, Best Supporting Actor: Refining the 509(a)(3) Type 3 Charitable Organization, 51 Duke L.J. 1367, 1378 (Feb 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reform==
===Past impact and criticism===
Mostly large and medium-sized donors created supporting organizations in order to retain some control over their donated assets.&lt;ref&gt;Victoria B. Bjorklund, Choosing Among the Private Foundation, Supporting Organization, and Donor-Advised Fund, SK088 ALI-ABA 83 (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; Type III supporting organizations comprised the sort of supporting organization with the least surveillance by the supported organizations, which meant greater donor control, and so Type III supporting organizations quickly became the favored form.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Commissioner Mark W. Everson Testimony to the Senate Finance Committee, Charitable Giving - Part 2, 4/5/05 CONGTMY, 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this flexibility, few donors outside of high and middle-high value donors created supporting organizations due to complex regulations and tax code provisions governing the formation and operation of supporting organizations.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; This entailed high transaction costs. Further, the demands of the tax code and associated regulations required the Type III supporting organizations to make such great relative donations of activity or grants to assure the attentiveness of the supported organizations.

As a consequence, supporting organizations (particularly Type III) proved attractive to high and middle-high value donors with anecdotal evidence of their widespread abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Ron Shoemaker &amp; Bill Brocker, P. Public Charity Classification and Private Foundation Issues: Recent Emerging Significant Developments, 2000 EO CPE Text, 223.&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporting organizations became subject to much criticism upon two perceived abuses.

One perceived abuse related to control. Senators Baucus and Grassley argued that supporting organizations, particularly Type III, allowed donors to retain too much control over their assets.&lt;ref&gt;Sens. Grassley, Baucus Plant to Take Aim at Abusive 'Supporting Organizations' For Charities, 4/25/05 USFEDNEWS.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another perceived abuse related to liberal charitable deductions allowed to donors who contribute to supporting organizations. Since donors retained so much control, these critics believed that they should not also enjoy deductions that they would get for donating to public charities.&lt;ref&gt;Grassley, Baucus Plan To Take Aim At Abusive "Supporting Organizations" For Charities, 4/26/05 GOVPR: Page 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, these critics argued that such deductions should be no more favored than private organizations or even less favored because of the greater control afforded to supporting organizations compared to private foundations.&lt;ref&gt;Grassley, Baucus Plan To Take Aim At Abusive "Supporting Organizations" For Charities, 4/26/05 GOVPR: Page 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pension Protection Act of 2006===
The Pension Protection Act of 2006&lt;ref&gt;Pension Protection Act of 2006, PL 109-280 (HR4)&lt;/ref&gt; cracked down on supporting organizations, particularly Type III. This act applied further regulations and penalties that took away many of the privileges that supporting organizations had over private foundations. The act applies the self-dealing regulations of private foundations on supporting organizations.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Pension Protection Act of 2006, PL 109-280 (HR 4), § 1242&lt;/ref&gt; The act requires a payout—but leaves the exact demands of the payout, including rate and from which assets for the Treasury to determine later.&lt;ref&gt;Pension Protection Act of 2006, PL 109-280 (HR 4), § 1226.&lt;/ref&gt; The Act applied the private foundation rules of excess business holdings&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; and the excess benefit prohibitions from the private foundation law.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; The act also tightened the tests for Type III supporting organizations to demonstrate that Type III supporting organizations has dependent supported organizations and that has no more than five supported organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Richard L. Fox, Charitable Incentives and Limitations of the Pension Protection Act, Estate Planning, 33 Est. Plann. 03, 13 (Dec. 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; The act also made collateral attacks on supporting organizations by forbidding donor-advised funds&lt;ref&gt;Pension Protection Act of 2006, PL 109-280 (HR 4), § 1231((c)(2)(A)(ii) taxable distribution).&lt;/ref&gt; and private foundations&lt;ref&gt;Pension Protection Act of 2006, PL 109-280 (HR 4), § 1244.&lt;/ref&gt; from making qualifying distributions to Type III supporting organizations, and should they do so the distributions would become taxable subject to their respective excise taxes. Further restrictions, including explication of the payout rate contours will result from the Congress mandated survey that the IRS promulgated.

===Congress-mandated survey===
In the Pension Protection Act, Congress mandated a study&lt;ref&gt;Pension Protection Act of 2006, PL 109-280 (HR4), § 1266&lt;/ref&gt; on the supporting organizations to understand their role in the exempt organization world and determine what future action remained necessary.&lt;ref&gt;Study on Donor Advised Funds and Supporting Organizations, Notice 2007-21.&lt;/ref&gt; It was called the "Study on [[Donor advised funds|Donor Advised Funds]] and Supporting Organizations."

==Definition==
Under § 509(a)(3) the Internal Revenue Code defines supporting organizations as being: 
*(A) is organized, and at all times thereafter is operated, exclusively for the benefit of, to perform the functions of, or to carry out the purposes of one or more specified organizations described in section 509(a)(1) or (2); and
*(B) is (i) operated, supervised, or controlled by one or more organizations described in paragraph (1) or (2), (ii) supervised or controlled in connection with one or more such organizations, or (iii) operated in connection with one or more such organizations; and
*(C) is not controlled directly or indirectly by one or more disqualified persons (as defined in 26 USCA 4946) other than foundation managers and other than one or more organizations described in section 509(a)(1) or (2).

===509(a)(3)(A)===
&lt;blockquote&gt;Is organized, and at all times thereafter is operated, exclusively for the benefit of, to perform the functions of, or to carry out the purposes of one or more specified organizations described in paragraph 509(a)(1) or (2)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This section breaks down into two tests: the organizational test ("is organized") and the operational test ("is operated").
*The organizational test demands that the supporting organization organize and operate exclusively to support one or more specified publicly supported charities. Here, the supporting organization must have its governing documents limit the organization to charitable purposes for specified supported organizations. An exception exists for the specification requirement when the two organizations have a continuous and historic relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Cockerline Memorial Fund, 86 TC 53, 63 (1986)&lt;/ref&gt;
*The operational test demands that the supported organization operate exclusively for the benefit of, to perform the functions of, or to carry out the purposes of one or more specified organizations described in § 509(a)(1) and (2).

===509(a)(3)(B)===
&lt;blockquote&gt;Is (i) operated, supervised, or controlled by one or more organizations described in paragraph (1) or (2), (ii) supervised or controlled in connection with one or more such organizations, or (iii) operated in connection with one or more such organizations&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This part provides three possible relationships between a supporting organization and its supported organizations. A supporting organization must fulfill the requirements of one of these three types and report it in its annual reporting to the IRS. Through either of these relationships the supported organizations provides the requisite public scrutiny over the supporting organizations. Type I resembles a parent-subsidiary relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Joint Committee on Taxation, Technical Explanation of HR 4, The "Pension Protection Act of 2006," JCX-38-06, Aug 3, 2006: Page 354.&lt;/ref&gt; Type II resembles a brother-sister relationship.&lt;ref name="Taxation 2006, Page 355"&gt;Joint Committee on Taxation, Technical Explanation of HR 4, The "Pension Protection Act of 2006," JCX-38-06, Aug 3, 2006: Page 355.&lt;/ref&gt; These two types are the stricter of the relationships while Type III has the most relaxed standard for scrutiny by the supported organizations. In exchange for this flexibility, type III supporting organizations must pass two additional tests to ensure that the supported organizations provide public scruinty.&lt;ref name="Merrie Jeanne Webel p. 55, 56"&gt;Merrie Jeanne Webel, The Supporting Organization: A Beneficial (but Tangled) Alternative for the Directed Donor, 15-APR Prob. &amp; Prop. 55, 56 (March/April 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; The first test is the responsiveness test and the second test is the integral part test.&lt;ref name="Merrie Jeanne Webel p. 55, 56"/&gt; The integral part test may further breakdown into two subtests, the "but for" subtest and the "attentiveness" subtest, either of which the organization may satisfy.&lt;ref&gt;Cockerline Memorial Fund, 86 TC 53, 61 (1986); Victoria B. Bjorklund, When is a Private Foundation the Best Option?, C911 ALI-ABA 135, 145 (June 27, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt; This type III relationship,&lt;ref name="Taxation 2006, Page 355"/&gt; however, recently has received a crackdown by Congress and so its flexibility and relaxed standards for control and scrutiny is short-lived.

===509(a)(3)(C)===
&lt;blockquote&gt;Is not controlled directly or indirectly by one or more disqualified persons (as defined in 26 USCA 4946) other than foundation managers and other than one or more organizations described in paragraph 509(a)(1) or (2)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This requirement provides prophylactic protection against self-dealing, a potential abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Ron Shoemaker &amp; Bill Brocker, P. Public Charity Classification and Private Foundation Issues: Recent Emerging Significant Developments, 2000 EO CPE Text: Page 223.&lt;/ref&gt; Some donors try to engage in self-dealing activities in order to maintain control over their assets by controlling the supporting or supported organizations. This requirement curbs nearly every possible way a donor may exert control over the organizations and their assets.

==Restrictions imposed by the Pension Protection Act of 2006==
===509(f)===
Through the [[Pension Protection Act of 2006|Pension Protection Act]], Congress recently added (f) to § 509. Section 509(f) adds new requirements for supporting organizations.

Under § 509(f)(1), the IRC imposes new requirements on type III supporting organizations in particular. Here, they impose a stricter definitions upon their relationships with their supporting organizations: 
*(A) The IRC does so by amending the responsiveness test to require the type III supporting organization to provide any documentation to their supporting organization that the IRS deems necessary;
*(B) Further, type III supporting organization may no longer support foreign entities.

In § 509(f)(2), the IRC concentrates on organizations controlled by donors:
*(A) Where a type III supporting organization may not have a relationship with a public charity that accepts donations from a person defined, in (B), otherwise known as a disqualified person or a close relative or spouse of that disqualified person. "Person" includes 35% controlled business entities.

(3) codifies the present understanding of "supported organization" as a public charity supported by a supporting organization.

===Charitable trust===
For an organization to qualify as a type III supporting organization, it must first prove that it constitutes a charitable trust under state law, the beneficiary is the supported trust, and the supported organization has the power to compel an accounting and enforce the trust.&lt;ref&gt;Pension Protection Act of 2006, PL 109-280 (HR 4), Title XII, § 1241(c).&lt;/ref&gt; Then, the organization must provide further evidence to prove that it operates in connection with its supported organizations.

===Functionally integrated===
A functionally integrated type III supporting organization ("FISO") performs the operations of the supported organization&lt;ref&gt;26 USCA 4943(f)(5)(B)&lt;/ref&gt; and remains free the excess business holding excise tax and from the payout rate that shall apply in the near future.&lt;ref&gt;26 USCA 4943(f)(6).&lt;/ref&gt; A FISO resembles a type III supporting organization that satisfies the "but for" test because they both perform the operations of the supported organization, but the exact requirements for qualifying as a FISO remains unknown. Currently, the IRS has halted determinations on all requests by organizations for FISO classification until the [[US Treasury Department]] issues guidance on this matter.&lt;ref name="IRS Acting Director 2007"&gt;IRS Acting Director, EO Rulings and Agreements: Robert Choi, Memorandum For Manager, EO Determinations, Supporting Organizations IRC § 509(a)(3), February 22, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Excess benefit transaction===
A disqualified person may not receive any benefit from a supporting organization otherwise the IRS may apply [[intermediate sanctions]] that tax that person 25% of the value of the benefit and tax the manager 10% of the benefit.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;PL 109-280 (HR 4), § 1242; 26 USCA 4958.&lt;/ref&gt; This tax may increase further if the offenders fail to rectify the transaction and lead up to revocation of tax-exempt status.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

===Excess business holdings===
A supporting organization in combination with its disqualified persons may not own more than 20% of voting stock in a business entity not related to the furtherance of its charitable purpose.&lt;ref&gt;26 USCA 4943(c).&lt;/ref&gt; Should a supporting organization do so, then it may subject itself to the excise tax.&lt;ref&gt;26 USCA 4943(a) &amp; (b).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treasury regulations==
The Treasury Regulations for supporting organizations contain detailed explanations for the applicable tests.&lt;ref&gt;26 CFR 1.509(a)-4&lt;/ref&gt; The regulations may change as the IRS has suspended determinations of what constitutes a functionally integrated type III supporting organization until such time that the Treasury Department may issue further guidance.&lt;ref name="IRS Acting Director 2007"/&gt;

On 20 June 1789, the members of the French [[Estates General (France)|Third Estate]], who had begun to call themselves the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]], took the '''Tennis Court Oath''' ({{lang-fr|Serment du [[Jeu de Paume]]}}), [[Oath|vowing]] "not to separate, and to reassemble wherever circumstances require, until the constitution of the [[Kingdom of France|kingdom]] is established". It was a pivotal event in the [[French Revolution]].

The Estates-General had been called to address the country's [[Causes of the French Revolution|fiscal and agricultural crisis]], but immediately after convening in May 1789, they had become bogged down in issues of representation—particularly, whether they would vote by head (which would increase the power of the Third Estate, as they outnumbered the other two estates hugely) or by order.

On 17 June, the Third Estate, led by the [[Honoré Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau|comte de Mirabeau]], began to call themselves the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]].&lt;ref name="Doyle"&gt;{{cite book|last=Doyle|first= William|title=The Oxford History of the French Revolution|publisher=Oxford University Press|year= 1990|page=105|isbn=978-0192852212}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the morning of 20 June, the deputies were shocked to discover that the chamber door was locked and guarded by soldiers. Immediately fearing the worst and anxious that a royal attack by [[King Louis XVI]] was imminent, the deputies congregated in a nearby indoor {{interlanguage link|Royal Tennis Court of Versailles|lt=''jeu de paume'' court|fr|salle du Jeu de paume}} in the {{interlanguage link|Saint-Louis, Versailles|lt=Saint-Louis district|fr|Saint-Louis (quartier de Versailles)}} of the city of [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]], near the [[Palace of Versailles]].

There, 576 of the 577 members from the [[Estates of the realm#Third Estate|Third Estate]] took a collective [[oath]] "[[:fr:Serment du jeu de paume#Texte du serment|not to separate, and to reassemble wherever circumstances require, until the constitution of the kingdom is established]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title= Proceedings of the Bunker Hill Monument Association at the annual meeting |first=Marshall Putnam |last=Thompson |chapter= The Fifth Musketeer: The Marquis de la Fayette |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qbvW7zpvRg8C|page= 50 |year= 1914 |accessdate=10 February 2011 |postscript= {{inconsistent citations}}.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only person who did not join was [[Joseph Martin-Dauch]] from [[Castelnaudary]], who would only execute decisions made by the king.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Historical Dictionary of the French Revolution|first=Paul R. |last=Hanson|year= 2004|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=Lanham, MD|isbn=9780810850521}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Before the Revolution, French society—aside from royalty—was divided into three [[Estates_of_the_realm#Kingdom_of_France|estates]].  The First Estate comprised the clergy; the Second Estate was the [[French nobility|nobility]].  The entire rest of France—some 98% of the population—was the Third Estate, which ranged from very wealthy city merchants to impoverished rural farmers.  The three estates met from time to time in the [[Estates General (France)|Estates General]], a legislative assembly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/193320/Estates-General Estates-General] in ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Third Estate was the overwhelming majority of the French population, the makeup of the Estates General was such that the Third Estate comprised a bare majority of the delegates.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} A simple majority was sufficient—as long as the delegates' votes were cast altogether.  The First and Second Estates preferred to divide the vote in some way.  A proposal might need to receive approval from each Estate, or there might be two "houses" of the Estates General (one for the first two Estates, and one for the Third), and a bill would need to be passed by both houses.  Either way, the First and Second Estates could exercise veto power over proposals enjoying widespread support among the Third Estate, such as reforms that threatened the privileges of the nobility and clergy.

In France at that time, the deputies' fears, even if wrong, were reasonable and the importance of the oath goes above and beyond its context.&lt;ref name="Osen"&gt;{{cite book|first= James L.|last= Osen|title=Royalist Political Thought during the French Revolution|year=1995|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|location=Westport, CT|isbn=9780313294419}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oath was both  a revolutionary act, and an assertion that political authority derived from the people and their representatives rather than from the monarch himself. Their solidarity forced Louis XVI to order the clergy and the nobility to join with the Third Estate in the National Assembly in order to give the illusion that he controlled the National Assembly.&lt;ref name="Doyle" /&gt; This oath would prove vital to the Third Estate as a step of protest that would eventually lead to more power in the [[Estates-General of 1789|Estates General]], and every governing body thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last = John D Ruddy|title = French Revolution in 9 Minutes|date = 2015-01-12|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1_2NwmIobU|accessdate = 2016-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Oath signified for the first time that French citizens formally stood in opposition to Louis XVI, and the National Assembly's refusal to back down forced the king to make concessions. It was foreshadowed by, and drew considerably from, the 1776 [[United States Declaration of Independence]], especially the preamble. The Oath also inspired a wide variety of revolutionary activity in the months afterwards, ranging from [[riot]]ing across the French countryside to renewed calls for a written French constitution. Likewise, it reinforced the Assembly's strength and forced the King to formally request that voting occur based on head, not power.{{citation needed|date = June 2012}}
The Tennis Court Oath (June 1789) preceded the [[abolition of feudalism in France|abolition of feudalism]] (4 August 1789) and the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen]] (26 August 1789).

'''''The Future of Ideas: The Fate of the Commons in a Connected World''''' (2001) is a book by [[Lawrence Lessig]], at the time of writing a professor of [[law]] at [[Stanford Law School]], who is well known as a critic of the extension of the [[copyright]] term in US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Starr|first=Sandy|title=Culture warrior|url=http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php/site/article/2369/|publisher=Spiked|accessdate=December 15, 2011|date=July 2, 2004|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120710115904/http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php/site/article/2369/|archivedate=July 10, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a continuation of his previous book ''[[Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace]]'', which is about how computer programs can restrict freedom of ideas in [[cyberspace]].

While copyright helps artists get rewarded for their work, Lessig warns that a copyright regime that is too strict and grants copyright for too long a period of time (e.g. the current US legal climate) can destroy innovation, as the future always builds on the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gelernter|first=David|title=The Computer World, Inside and Out|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/12/books/books-of-the-times-the-computer-world-inside-and-out.html?pagewanted=all|work=Books of the Times|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=December 15, 2011|date=December 12, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lessig also discusses recent movements by corporate interests to promote longer and tighter protection of [[intellectual property]] in three layers: the code layer, the content layer, and the physical layer.

The code layer is that which is controlled by computer programs. One instance is [[Internet censorship in mainland China]] by sorting out geographical [[IP address]]es. The content layer is notoriously illustrated by [[Napster]], a [[peer-to-peer file sharing]] service.  Lessig criticizes the reaction of music companies and [[Hollywood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Stalder|first=Felix|title=The excess of control|url=http://www.heise.de/tp/artikel/11/11504/1.html|accessdate=December 15, 2011|newspaper=Telepolis|date=January 8, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The physical layer is the one that actually conveys information from one point to another, and can be either wired or wireless. He discusses particularly the regulation of the [[radio frequency|radio spectrum]] in the United States.

In the end, he stresses the importance of existing works entering the public domain in a reasonably short period of time, as the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] intended.

On 15 January 2008, Lessig announced on his blog that his publishers agreed to license the book under a [[Creative Commons licenses|Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial license]], and the book in [[PDF]] format can be downloaded freely.&lt;ref&gt;Lessig, Lawrence.

'''''The John Marshall Journal of Information Technology and Privacy Law''''' is a [[law review]] published by a student group at the [[John Marshall Law School (Chicago)]]. it covers international information technology and privacy law. The journal was cited by a recent decision of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in ''[[Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc.]]''

==History==
The journal was originally established as the ''Software Law Journal'' by Michael D. Scott. In 1987, Scott invited the John Marshall Law School to assume editorial control of the journal, because of the school's commitment to education in the area of information technology law. In 1994, Scott then invited the school to merge the ''Software Law Journal'' with the ''Computer Law Journal'', and to assume editorial control and publishing rights of the new journal.

Theranos claimed its technology was revolutionary and that its tests required only about 1/100 to 1/1,000 of the amount of blood that would ordinarily be needed and cost far less than existing tests.

A turning point came in October 2015, when investigative reporter [[John Carreyrou]] of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' questioned the validity of Theranos' technology. Since then, the company has faced a string of legal and commercial challenges from medical authorities, investors, the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC), [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] (CMS), state attorneys general, former business partners, patients, and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ableson|first1=Reed|title=Theranos Under Federal Criminal Investigation, Adding to Its Woes|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/19/business/theranos-sec-justice-department-investigation.html|accessdate=18 April 2018|work=New York Times|date=April 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By June 2016, it was estimated that Holmes' personal net worth had dropped from $4.5 billion to virtually nothing.&lt;ref name="Forbes_nothing" /&gt; The company was near [[bankruptcy]] until it received a $100 million investment from [[Fortress Investment Group]] in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/blood-testing-firm-theranos-gets-100-million-lifeline-from-fortress-1514057523|title=Blood-Testing Firm Theranos Gets $100 Million Lifeline From Fortress|last1=Carreyrou|first1=John|date=24 December 2017|work=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=14 March 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2018, the company was again close to going bankrupt.

In July 2016, Theranos received sanctions from the CMS, including the revocation of its [[Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments|CLIA]] certificate and prohibition of Holmes and other company officials from owning or operating a lab for two years.&lt;ref name=carreyrou&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-regulator-bans-theranos-ceo-elizabeth-holmes-from-operating-labs-for-two-years-1467956064 |title=Theranos Dealt Sharp Blow as Elizabeth Holmes Is Banned From Operating Labs|last=Carreyrou|first=John|date=2016-07-08 |last2=Siconolfi|first2=Michael|newspaper=[[Wall Street Journal]]|issn=0099-9660|last3=Weaver|first3=Christopher|access-date=2016-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theranos announced it would close its laboratory operations and wellness centers to work on miniature medical testing machines.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news |title=Theranos to Close Labs and Lay Off 340 Workers|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/06/business/theranos-to-close-labs-and-lay-off-340-workers.html|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=5 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2017, Theranos said it had reached a settlement agreement with CMS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.theranos.com/2017/04/17/theranos-reaches-resolution-centers-medicare-medicaid-services/|title=Theranos Reaches Resolution with Centers For Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services |publisher=Theranos Newsroom|date=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the CMS sanctions, the [[Walgreens]] pharmacy chain terminated its contract with Theranos and filed a lawsuit claiming continuous [[Breach of contract|breaches of contract]]. The suit was [[settled out of court]], with Theranos compensating Walgreens for a much smaller amount than the claimed $140 million, reported at about $30 million.

On March 14, 2018, Theranos, Holmes, and former company president [[Ramesh Balwani|Ramesh "Sunny" Balwani]] were charged with "massive [[fraud]]" by the SEC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2018/03/14/theranos-founder-elizabeth-holmes-charged-massive-fraud/424670002/|title=Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes charged with 'massive fraud'|publisher=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; One section of the complaint says Holmes falsely claimed in 2014 that the company had annual revenues of $100 million, a thousand times more than the actual figure of $100,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/14/theranos-president-exaggerated-revenue-by-1000x-says-sec.html|title=Theranos president exaggerated the company's revenue by 1,000x to investors, says SEC|last=Aiello|first=Chloe|date=2018-03-14|work=CNBC|access-date=2018-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theranos and Holmes agreed to resolve the charges against them, with Holmes paying a fine of $500,000, returning the remaining 18.9 million shares that she held, relinquishing her control of the company, and being barred from being an officer or director of any [[public company]] for ten years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/14/health/theranos-elizabeth-holmes-fraud.html|title=Elizabeth Holmes, Theranos C.E.O. and Silicon Valley Star, Accused of Fraud|last1=Thomas|first1=Katie|date=14 March 2018|work=New York Times|accessdate=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2018/03/14/theranos-founder-elizabeth-holmes-charged-massive-fraud/424670002/|title=Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes charged with 'massive fraud'|work=USA Today|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the agreement, if Theranos were acquired or otherwise [[liquidation|liquidated]], Holmes would not profit from her ownership until more than $750 million was returned to investors and other preferred shareholders.

Theranos ceased operations on August 31, 2018, with CEO David Taylor and a few support staff remaining on payroll for a few more days.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wsj.com/articles/blood-testing-firm-theranos-to-dissolve-1536115130&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

While at [[Stanford University]], Elizabeth Holmes had an idea to develop a wearable patch that could adjust the dosage of drug delivery and notify doctors of variables in patients' blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inc.com/magazine/201510/kimberly-weisul/the-longest-game.html|title=How Playing the Long Game Made Elizabeth Holmes a Billionaire|work=[[Inc. (magazine)|Inc.]]|date=October 2015|access-date=3 September 2016|author=Weisul, Kimberly}}&lt;/ref&gt; She started developing [[lab-on-a-chip]] technology for blood tests, and had the idea for a company that would make testing cheaper, more convenient and accessible to consumers.&lt;ref name=never&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/print-edition/2013/08/30/theranos-the-biggest-biotech-youve.html|title=Theranos: The biggest biotech you've never heard of|last=Leuty|first=Ron|date=30 August 2013|work=San Francisco Business Times|accessdate=9 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holmes dropped out of Stanford and used the education trust from her parents to found the company that would later be called Theranos, derived from a combination of the words "therapy" and "diagnosis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/02/elizabeth-holmes-theranos/|title=This Woman Invented a Way to Run 30 Lab Tests on Only One Drop of Blood|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|date=18 February 2014|access-date=27 September 2016|author=Roper, Caitlin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pharmacytimes.com/contributor/beth-bolt-rph/2014/11/bringing-painless-blood-testing-to-the-pharmacy|title=Bringing Painless Blood Testing to the Pharmacy|work=[[Pharmacy Times]]|date=14 November 2014|access-date=27 September 2016|author=Bolt, Beth}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company's original name was '''Real-Time Cures''',&lt;ref name="parloff" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/the-history-of-silicon-valley-unicorn-theranos-and-ceo-elizabeth-holmes-2018-5|title=The rise and fall of Theranos, the blood-testing startup that went from a rising star in Silicon Valley to facing fraud charges over a wild 15-year span|work=[[Business Insider]]|date=May 25, 2018|access-date=June 11, 2018|author1=Hu, Charlotte|author2=Ramsey, Lydia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2016/05/everything-need-know-theranos-saga-far/|title=Everything You Need to Know About the Theranos Saga So Far|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|date=May 4, 2016|access-date=June 11, 2018|author=Stockton, Nick}}&lt;/ref&gt; which Holmes changed after deciding that too many people were dubious about the word "cure".&lt;ref name="parloff" /&gt;

===Partnerships===
In September 2013, Theranos partnered with Walgreens to offer in-store blood tests at more than 40 locations. Walgreens announced plans to expand the "wellness centers" across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2014/11/18/walgreens-blood-tests/|title=Walgreens to offer affordable and needle-free blood tests in more stores (updated)|work=[[Business Insider]]|date=18 November 2014|access-date=4 September 2016|author=Moon, Mariella}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theranos blood tests were used on drug trial patients of [[GlaxoSmithKline]] and [[Pfizer]]. Each company stated that there were no ongoing active projects with Theranos in October 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/business/21656196-theranos-ambitious-silicon-valley-firm-wants-shake-up-market-medical|title=Young blood|work=[[The Economist]]|date=27 June 2015|access-date=4 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Duhaime-Ross"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Theranos didn't work with the huge drug company it supposedly made money from, drug company says|last=Duhaime-Ross|first=Arielle|date=2015-10-26|url = https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/26/9618390/Theranos-glaxosmithkline-denies-partnership-pfizer-blood-test|website = The Verge|accessdate = 2015-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2016, Walgreen Co. filed suit against Theranos in a federal court in Delaware, for breach of contract.  Theranos reported to investors on June 21, 2017 that the suit, which originally sought $140 million in damages, was settled for less than $30 million.&lt;ref&gt;Weaver, Christopher, John Carreyrou and Michael Siconolfi, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/walgreens-seeks-to-recover-140-million-investment-from-theranos-1478642410 "Walgreen Sues Theranos, Seeks $140 Million in Damages"], ''Wall Street Journal'', November 8, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/21/theranos-walgreens-reportedly-reach-a-deal-to-settle-suit-for-under-30-million.html|title=Theranos, Walgreens reportedly reach a deal to settle suit for under $30 million|last=Thomas|first=Lauren|date=2017-06-21|access-date=2017-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2015 the [[Cleveland Clinic]] announced a partnership with Theranos to test its technology in order to decrease the cost of lab tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://video.foxbusiness.com/v/4100844587001/theranos-cleveland-clinic-ceos-on-innovation-partnership-/?#sp=show-clips|title=Theranos, Cleveland Clinic CEO's on innovation partnership|work=[[Fox Business]]|date=9 March 2015|access-date=4 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theranos became the lab-work provider for Pennsylvania insurers, AmeriHealth Caritas and Capital BlueCross, in July 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/morning_roundup/2015/07/amerihealth-caritas-theranos-lab-test-low-income.html|title=Philadelphia health insurer to make lab testing easier for Medicaid members|work=[[Philadelphia Business Journal]]|date=16 July 2016|access-date=4 September 2016|author=George, John}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-07-08/fingerprick-lab-test-startup-theranos-strikes-insurance-deal|title=Fingerprick Lab Test Startup Theranos Strikes Insurance Deal|work=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]|date=8 July 2015|access-date=4 September 2016|author1=Chen, Caroline|author2=Tracer, Zachary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2015, the [[Food and Drug Administration]] approved the use of the company's fingerstick blood testing device for the [[herpes simplex virus]] (HSV-1) outside a clinical laboratory setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Parloff|first1=Roger|title=Disruptive diagnostics firm Theranos gets boost from FDA|url=http://fortune.com/2015/07/02/theranos-fda-approval/|accessdate=16 July 2015|publisher=Fortune Magazine|date=2 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconbeat.com/2015/07/16/theranos-gets-another-fda-approval-for-its-blood-test/|title=Theranos gets another FDA approval for its blood test|work=Silicon Beat|date=16 July 2015|access-date=27 September 2016|author=Quinn, Michelle}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theranos was awarded the 2015 Bioscience Company of the Year by AzBio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azbio.org/azbio-awards-2015|title=AZBio Awards 2015|publisher=AzBio.org|date=2015|access-date=27 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exposure and downfall===
In October 2015, [[John Carreyrou]] of the ''The Wall Street Journal'' reported that Theranos was using traditional blood testing machines to run its tests instead of the company's Edison devices, and that the company's Edison machines might provide inaccurate results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/09/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-exclusive|title=Exclusive: How Elizabeth Holmes's House of Cards Came Tumbling Down|last=Bilton|first=Nick|work=The Hive|access-date=2017-04-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|title = Hot Startup Theranos Has Struggled With Its Blood-Test Technology|url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-has-struggled-with-blood-tests-1444881901|newspaper = Wall Street Journal|access-date = 2015-10-29|issn = 0099-9660|first = John|last = Carreyrou}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theranos claimed that the allegations were "factually and scientifically erroneous and grounded in baseless assertions by inexperienced and disgruntled former employees and industry incumbents".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Report Claims Theranos Struggling With Blood Test Tech|url = http://fortune.com/2015/10/15/theranos-blood-tests-wsj/|website = Fortune|accessdate = 2015-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://recode.net/2015/10/22/theranos-attacks-wall-street-journal-again-in-a-rebuttal-youll-need-a-medical-degree-to-understand/|title=Theranos Attacks Wall Street Journal (Again) in a Rebuttal You'll Need a Medical Degree to Understand|author=Dawn Chmielewski|work=[[Re/code]]|accessdate=26 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walgreens suspended plans to expand blood-testing centers in their stores following the report.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Walgreens halts expansion of Theranos centers | work = Fortune Magazine | date = 24 October 2015 | accessdate = 2015-10-25 | url=http://fortune.com/2015/10/24/walgreens-theranos/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/11/21/in-defense-of-theranos/ | title=In Defense Of Theranos | publisher=TechCrunch | date=21 November 2015 | accessdate=23 October 2016 | author=Rosenbloom, Micah}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, the Cleveland Clinic announced that it would work to verify Theranos technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.cnbc.com/2015/10/30/well-work-to-verify-theranos-technology-cleveland-clinic-ceo.html | title=We'll test Theranos tech: Cleveland Clinic CEO | publisher=CNBC | date=30 October 2015 | accessdate=23 October 2016 | author=DiChristopher, Tom}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theranos fought back against the ''Journal''&lt;nowiki&gt;'s&lt;/nowiki&gt; investigation, sending lawyers after sources in the story in an effort to stop them from providing information to the press.&lt;ref name="BadBlood" /?  Tyler Shultz was a key source for the WSJ story.  Schultz was a Theranos employee from 2013 to 14 and the grandson of one-time Theranos director [[George P. Shultz]].

Following the WSJ story, the history of FDA interactions with Theranos were scrutinized.  The FDA had received a formal inquiry to look at Theranos blood test devices by the U.S. Department of Defense in 2012 before the devices were commercially available and did not require FDA approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/12/02/internal-emails-reveal-concerns-about-theranoss-fda-compliance-date-back-years/?tid=pm_business_pop_b|title=E-mails reveal concerns about Theranos's FDA compliance date back years|first = Carolyn Y.|last = Johnson|date=2 December 2015|work=[[Washington Post]]|accessdate=26 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; FDA inspection reports from 2014 and 2015 stated that its containers for blood collection were "not validated under actual or simulated use conditions" and "were not reviewed and not approved by designated individual(s) prior to issuance".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = The FDA's notes from its visit to Theranos' labs don't look good  | work = Business Insider | date = 27 October 2015 | accessdate = 2015-10-27 | url=http://www.businessinsider.com/fda-documents-on-theranos-2015-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FDA inspection in 2015 resulted in multiple [[Form_FDA_483|483]]'s from the FDA where inspectors observed violations of [[Title_21_of_the_Code_of_Federal_Regulations|FDA Title 21 Regulations]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.fda.gov/downloads/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/OfficeofGlobalRegulatoryOperationsandPolicy/ORA/ORAElectronicReadingRoom/UCM469396.pdf | title = FDA-483 | date = 16 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.fda.gov/downloads/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/OfficeofGlobalRegulatoryOperationsandPolicy/ORA/ORAElectronicReadingRoom/UCM469395.pdf |title = FDA-483 | date = 16 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the inspection, Theranos announced that it would voluntarily suspend its tests apart from the FDA-approved herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.techtimes.com/articles/98407/20151022/blood-testing-start-up-theranos-is-in-pause-period-says-ceo-elizabeth-holmes.htm | title=Blood-Testing Start-Up Theranos Is In 'Pause Period', Says CEO Elizabeth Holmes | publisher=Tech Times | date=22 October 2015 | accessdate=23 October 2016 | author=Derla, Katherine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Arizona Department of Health Services]] reported issues with the company's Scottsdale lab meeting regulations in October 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Theranos suspends micro blood tests to allow FDA review | work = AZ Central| date = October 25, 2015 | accessdate = 2015-10-26 | url=http://www.azcentral.com/news/arizona/investigations/2015/10/25/theranos-suspends-micro-blood-tests-allow-fda-review/74355082/}}{{dead link|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In January 2016, the [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] (CMS) sent a letter to Theranos based on an inspection of its Newark, California, lab in the Fall of 2015, reporting that the facility did not "comply with certificate requirements and performance standards" and caused an "immediate jeopardy to patient health and safety" due to a test to determine the correct dose of the blood-thinning drug [[warfarin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = US government says Theranos lab poses 'immediate jeopardy to patient safety'|url = https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/27/10853340/government-says-theranos-lab-poses-immediate-threat-to-public-safety|website = The Verge|access-date = 2016-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Walgreens and Capital BlueCross announced a suspension of Theranos blood tests from the Newark lab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.businessinsider.com/capital-bluecross-and-theranos-2016-1 | title=Another partner just asked Theranos to stop running blood tests | publisher=Business Insider | date=29 January 2016 | accessdate=23 October 2016 | author=Ramsey, Lydia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2016, Theranos announced that it had voided two years of results from its Edison device.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-voids-two-years-of-edison-blood-test-results-1463616976|title=Theranos Voids Two Years of Edison Blood-Test Results|last=Carreyrou|first=John|date=2016-05-19|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|issn=0099-9660|access-date=2016-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company announced that about 1&amp;nbsp;percent of test results had been voided or corrected from its proprietary machines in June 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-06-03/theranos-says-only-1-of-results-affected-some-doubt-tests|title=Theranos Says Only 1% of Results Affected; Some Doubt Tests|author1=Caroline Chen|author2=Rebecca Spalding|date=June 3, 2016|accessdate=June 29, 2016|website=Bloomberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2016, Theranos announced that the CMS had revoked its CLIA certificate and issued sanctions prohibiting its owners and operators from owning or operating a lab for two years, suspension of approval to receive Medicare and Medicaid payments, and a civil monetary penalty. The company discontinued testing at its Newark location while attempting to resolve the issues.&lt;ref name=carreyrou/&gt; Theranos announced plans to appeal the decision by regulators to revoke its license to operate a lab in California and other sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-to-appeal-regulatory-sanctions-1472192782 "Theranos to Appeal Regulatory Sanctions"] ''Wall Street Journal'', Retrieved 26 August 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017, lawyers for Partner Investments LP and two other funds, with combined stakes totaling more than $96 million in Theranos preferred shares, charged that Theranos had threatened to seek [[Chapter 11 Bankruptcy|bankruptcy protection]] if the investors did not agree to accept additional stock equity in lieu of litigation.

=== Shutdown ===
On September 4, 2018, Theranos announced in an email to investors that it would cease operations and release its assets and remaining cash to creditors after all efforts to find a buyer came to nothing. Most of the company's remaining employees were laid off on the previous Friday, August 31. However, CEO David Taylor and a few support staffers remained on payroll for a few more days.&lt;ref name="TheranosShutdown"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/blood-testing-firm-theranos-to-dissolve-1536115130|last1=Carreyrou|first1=John|title=Blood-Testing Firm Theranos to Dissolve|publisher=Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time the Theranos website was inaccessible. The Wall Street Journal reported that any equity investments in the company were made worthless by the shutdown.

==Corporate affairs==
===Location===
Theranos was headquartered in Palo Alto, California. It previously had laboratories in [[Newark, California]] and [[Scottsdale, Arizona]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Theranos Founder Faces a Test of Technology, and Reputation | work = [[The New York Times]] | author1 = Abelson, Reed | author2 = Creswell, Julie | date = 19 December 2015 | access-date = 2 July 2016 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/20/business/theranos-founder-faces-a-test-of-technology-and-reputation.html?_r=0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Management===
From its incorporation in 2003 until 2018, Holmes was the company's chief executive officer. She recruited [[Channing Robertson]], a chemical-engineering professor at Stanford, to be a technical advisor and the company's first board member during its early years. Holmes' then-boyfriend [[Ramesh Balwani|Sunny Balwani]], a software engineer 18 years her senior whom Holmes had met during high school, joined the company as its president and chief operating officer in 2009.&lt;ref name=auletta&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/12/15/blood-simpler|title=Blood, Simpler|work=[[The New Yorker]]|date=15 December 2014|access-date=31 May 2016|author=Auletta, Ken}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2011, Holmes was introduced to former Secretary of State [[George Shultz]], who joined the Theranos board of directors that month.&lt;ref name=fortune&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2014/06/12/theranos-board-directors/|title=A singular board at Theranos|work=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]|date=12 June 2014|access-date=11 May 2016|author=Parloff, Roger}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next three years, Shultz helped to introduce almost all the outside directors on the "all-star board," which included [[William Perry]] (former Secretary of Defense), [[Henry Kissinger]] (former Secretary of State), [[Sam Nunn]] (former U.S. Senator), [[Bill Frist]] (former U.S. Senator and heart-transplant surgeon), [[Gary Roughead]] (Admiral, [[United States Navy|USN]], retired), [[James Mattis]] (General, [[United States Marine Corps|USMC]]), [[Richard Kovacevich]] (former Wells Fargo Chairman and CEO) and [[Riley Bechtel]] (chairman of the board and former CEO at [[Bechtel Group]]).&lt;ref name=fortune/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/print-edition/2013/08/02/theranos-adds-kovacevich-to-all-star.html|title=Theranos adds Kovacevich to all-star board|last=Leuty|first=Ron|date=2 August 2013|work=San Francisco Business Times|accessdate=9 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/blog/biotech/2013/07/theranos-dick-kovacevich-james-mattis.html|title=Quiet Theranos adds former Wells chief Kovacevich, 'Mad Dog' Mattis to power-packed board|last=Leuty|first=Ron|date=29 July 2013|work=San Francisco Business Times|accessdate=9 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The board was criticized for consisting "mainly of directors with diplomatic or military backgrounds."&lt;ref name=never/&gt;

Balwani left his position as President and COO in May 2016.

In December 2016, it was announced the Theranos management team would be restructured with the departing of Riley Bechtel.  In January 2017 incoming [[US Secretary of Defense]] nominee James Mattis resigned from the Theranos board. In January 2017 the Theranos board of directors included:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ramsey|first1=Lydia|title=Theranos Dissolves High-Profile Board of Counselors|url=http://www.inc.com/business-insider/theranos-retires-board-of-counselors-leadership-kissinger-schultz.html|website=Inc.|accessdate=3 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth Holmes, William Foege, Fabrizio Bonanni, and [[Daniel Warmenhoven]], former [[NetApp]] CEO, who replaced Riley Bechtel

Theranos raised millions of dollars in its first years.

In May 2017, participating shareholders provided a release of any potential claims against Theranos in exchange for shares of the company's new [[preferred stock]].

The '''Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities Directive''' [https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX:02009L0065-20140917#E0011 2009/65/EC] is a consolidated [[EU Directive]],&lt;ref&gt;Last amended by Directive [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32014L0091 2014/91/EU]&lt;/ref&gt; that allows [[collective investment scheme]]s to operate freely throughout the EU on the basis of a single authorisation from one [[List of European Union member states|member state]]. EU member states are entitled to have additional regulatory requirements for the benefit of investors.

==Evolution==
The objective of the original UCITS Directive 85/611/EEC, adopted in 1985, was to allow for [[Open-end fund|open-ended funds]] investing in transferable [[securities]] to be subject to the same regulation in every [[Member State]]. It was hoped that once such legislative uniformity was established throughout Europe, funds authorised in one Member State could be sold to the public in each Member State without further authorisation, thereby furthering the EU's goal of a single market for [[financial services]] in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;nb at the time the EU was still the European Economic Community. The term European Union did not come about until 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

The reality differed somewhat from the expectation due primarily to individual marketing rules in each Member State that created obstacles to [[cross-border]] marketing of UCITS. In addition, the limited definition of permitted investments for UCITS weakened the marketing possibilities of a UCITS. Accordingly, in the early 1990s proposals were developed to amend the 1985 Directive and more successfully harmonise laws throughout Europe. These discussions, although leading to a draft UCITS II directive, were subsequently abandoned as being too ambitious when the [[Council of the European Union|Council of Ministers]] could not reach a common position.

In July 1998 the [[EU Commission]] published a new proposal which was drafted in two parts (a product proposal and a service provider proposal), which sought to amend the 1985 Directive. These proposals were finally adopted in December 2001, and are known as "UCITS III", which are now in force. LuxAlpha, an alleged "feeder fund" to [[Bernard Madoff]]'s firm,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Sandler | first = Linda | title = LuxAlpha Seeks to Move Madoff Suit to U.S. District Court | publisher = Bloomberg | date = 12 July 2011 | url = https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-07-12/luxalpha-seeks-to-move-madoff-suit-to-u-s-district-court-1-.html | accessdate = 12 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was a UCITS-regulated fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Sender | first = Sam | title = Action Needed to Shield Investors from Ucits Risk| work = Financial Times | date = 27 March 2011 | url = http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/e20bc0d6-5859-11e0-9b8a-00144feab49a.html | accessdate = 12 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Management Directive===
The Management Directive 2001/107/EC, seeks to give management companies a "European passport" to operate throughout the EU, and widens the activities which they are allowed to undertake. It also introduces the concept of a simplified [[prospectus (finance)|prospectus]], which is intended to provide more accessible and comprehensive information in a simplified format to assist the cross-border marketing of UCITS throughout Europe.

===Product Directive===
The primary aim of the Product Directive 2001/108/EC is to remove barriers to the cross-border marketing of units of collective investment funds by allowing funds to invest in a wider range of financial instruments (including [[Derivative (finance)|derivative]]s), which subject the same regulation in every Member state.  All UCITS funds must comply with the same investment limits.

A [[collective investment fund]] may apply for UCITS status in order to allow EU-wide marketing. The concept is to create a single funds market across the EU. The aim is that with a larger market the economies of scale will reduce costs for investment managers which can be passed on to consumers.

Throughout Europe approximately €6.8 [[1000000000000 (number)|trillion]] are invested in [[collective investment]]s. Of these funds about 76% are UCITS.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.efama.org/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=doc_download&amp;gid=872&amp;Itemid=-99 EFAMA – Q3 2008] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100714045529/http://www.efama.org/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=doc_download&amp;gid=872&amp;Itemid=-99 |date=14 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===UCITS IV===
The proposal of UCITS IV Directive&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52008PC0458:EN:HTML |title=EURLex – 52008PC0458 – EN |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |accessdate=19 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; was approved by the [[European Parliament]] on 13 January 2009 and also by the [[Council of the European Union]] as the Directive 2009/65/EC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32009L0065:EN:NOT |title=EURLex – 32009L0065 – EN |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |accessdate=19 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; to be implemented on 1 July 2011. This updated the UCITS III Directives by introducing the following changes,

*Notification Procedure
*Key Investor Information Document
*Adapted Framework for Mergers
*[[Master-feeder]] Structures
*Cooperation between Member State Supervisory Authorities
*Management Company Passport

===UCITS V===
On 23 July 2014 the [[European Union]] adopted directive 2014/91/EU ("'''UCITS V'''") on the co-ordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities as regards depositary functions, remuneration policies and sanctions. 

UCITS V can be compared with the [[Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive]] ("'''[[AIFMD]]'''") (European Union Directive 2011/61/EU), which is a parallel regulation for hedge funds and alternative investments.

UCITS V introduces new rules on UCITS depositaries, such as the entities eligible to assume this role, their tasks, delegation arrangements and the depositaries’ liability as well as general remuneration principles that apply to fund managers. 

The depositary as a specific function under UCITS legislation (rather as it does under AIFMD). The depositary may delegate its safekeeping functions (but not other depositary functions to a third party custodian.

UCITS V directive requires a Key Investor Information Document or KIID is produced for investors – see example (autokiid.com)

Luxembourg transposed the UCITS V directive with the law of 10 May 2016 applied since 1 June 2016. This law of 10 May 2016 amended the Luxembourg law of 17 December 2010 on undertakings for collective investment, as amended (the "2010 Law"), in particular, Parts I, IV and V of the 2010 Law.

===UCITS VI===

The proposals concern areas other than those addressed by UCITS V. In summary, these are the topics raised:
1. eligible assets and the use of derivatives – whether it is necessary to limit the scope of eligible derivatives of those traded on multilateral platforms and cleared by a central counterparty;
2. efficient portfolio management techniques – whether the current criteria (on eligibility, liquidity and diversification for example) requires amendment;
3. over-the-counter derivatives ('OTC') – how OTC derivative transactions should be dealt with when assessing UCITS limits on counterparty 
4. extraordinary liquidity management rules – whether there is a need for a common framework for dealing with liquidity bottlenecks in exceptional cases or otherwise;
5. depositary passport – whether a depositary passport should be introduced and how this would work in practice;
6. money market funds1 – whether they present a source of systemic risk and/or do they need harmonised regulation at EU level;
7. long-term investments – (a) how access can be afforded to retail investors and how this could be implemented and regulated; (b) what proportion of a fund's portfolio should be dedicated to such assets; and (c) whether
diversification rules are necessary to secure adequate liquidity;
8. improvements to the UCITS IV framework – for example Article 64(1) of the UCITS Directive requires UCITS to provide information to investors in the following two cases: (i) where an ordinary UCITS converts into a feeder
UCITS; and (ii) where a master UCITS changes. As it stands, this does not cover a third possible scenario, namely where a feeder UCITS converts into an ordinary UCITS. Such conversions may lead to a significant
change in the investment strategy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8525">[[Yahoo!]] has been a party to several instances of litigation.

==Patent litigation==

===FindWhat.com===
In May 1999, GoTo.com filed a patent application titled "System and method for influencing a position on a search result list generated by a computer network search engine". The patent was granted as {{Cite patent|US|6269361}} in July 2001. A related patent has also been granted in Australia and other patent applications remain pending.

Prior to its acquisition by Yahoo!, Overture initiated infringement proceedings under this patent against FindWhat.com in January 2002 and [[Google]] in April 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.com/2100-1023-876861.html Overture sues Google over search patent], Stefanie Olsen and Gwendolyn Mariano, CNet news.com, April 5, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

===Google===
The lawsuit against Google related to its [[AdWords]] service. In February 2002, Google introduced a service called AdWords Select that allowed marketers to bid for higher placement in marked sections - a tactic that had some similarities to Overture's search-listing auctions.

Following Yahoo!'s acquisition of Overture, the lawsuit was settled with [[Google]] agreeing to issue 2.7 million shares of [[common stock]] to Yahoo! in exchange for a perpetual license.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.cnet.com/Google,-Yahoo-bury-the-legal-hatchet/2100-1024_3-5302421.html?tag=mncol Google, Yahoo bury the legal hatchet], Stefanie Olsen, CNET News.com, August 9, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

===Facebook===
Yahoo filed a suit against [[Facebook]] on March 12, 2012, claiming Facebook had [[patent infringement|infringed]] on ten of Yahoo's [[patents]]
.&lt;ref&gt;USA Today, published March 13, 2012, page B1, "Yahoo sues Facebook over patents"&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geocities ==
In 1999, a complaint was instituted against GeoCities stating that the corporation violated the provisions of the [[Federal Trade Commission Act]] under 14 USC §45, which states in relevant part,  "Unfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce, and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce, are hereby declared unlawful." The FTC found that GeoCities was engaged in deceptive acts and practices in contravention to their stated privacy act. Subsequently, a consent order was entered into which prohibits GeoCities from misrepresenting the purpose for which it collects and/or uses personal identifying information from consumers. A copy of the complaint and order can be found at [http://www.ftc.gov/os/decisions/docs/Volume127.pdf#page=94 127 F.T.C. 94] (page 94).&lt;ref name=ftc127&gt;[http://www.ftc.gov/os/decisions/docs/Volume127.pdf#page=94 FTC.gov]&lt;/ref&gt;

The litigation came about in this way: GeoCities provided free home pages and e-mail address to children and adults who provided personally identifying and demographic information when they registered for the website. At the time of the complaint, GeoCities had more than 1.8 million members who were "homesteaders." GeoCities illegally permitted third-party advertisers to promote products targeted to GeoCities' 1.8 million users, by using [[personally identifiable information]] obtained in the registration process. These acts and practices affected "commerce" as defined in Section 4 of the Federal Trade Commission.&lt;ref name=ftc127/&gt;

The problem GeoCities faced was that it placed a privacy statement on its New Member Application Form and on its website promising that it would never give personally identifying information to anyone without the user's permission. GeoCities sold personal information to third parties who used the information for purposes other than those for which members gave permission.&lt;ref name=ftc127/&gt;

It was ordered that GeoCities would not make any misrepresentation, in any manner about its collection or use of personal identifying information, including what information will be disclosed to third parties. GeoCities was not allowed to collect personal identifying information from any child if GeoCities had actual knowledge that the child did not have his parents' permission to provide the information.&lt;ref name=ftc127/&gt;

==Wang Xiaoning and Shi Tao==
On April 18, 2007, [[Wang Xiaoning]]'s wife Yu Ling sued Yahoo! under [[human rights]] laws, specifically the [[Alien Torts Statute]] (28 U.S.C. § 1350) and [[Torture Victim Protection Act]] of 1991 (TVPA), 106 Stat. 73 (1992) in federal court in [[San Francisco]], [[California]], [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2007/04/19/BUGU9PB4SG1.DTL&amp;type=printable|title= Suit by wife of Chinese activist|author= Egelko, Bob|date= 2007-04-19|publisher= SF Gate}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Wang was named as a [[plaintiff]] in the Yahoo suit, as was [[Shi Tao (journalist)|Shi Tao]], a Chinese journalist detained and convicted for emailing a description of Chinese’s government’s instructions to journalists for the upcoming anniversary of the 1989 Tiananmen Square Massacre.  Both men were punished for exercising their freedom of speech because Yahoo!’s Chinese subsidiary provided their identifying information to the Chinese government.&lt;ref name="humanrightsusa.org"&gt;http://www.humanrightsusa.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=15&amp;Itemid=35&lt;/ref&gt;

The lawsuit was filed by the [[World Organization for Human Rights USA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Second Amended Complaint| url=http://www.humanrightsusa.org/index2.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=doc_view&amp;gid=68&amp;Itemid=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Yahoo is guilty of 'an act of corporate irresponsibility,' said [[Morton Sklar]], then the Executive Director of the group. 'Yahoo had reason to know that if they provided China with identification information that those individuals would be arrested."&lt;ref name="Post"&gt;{{cite news|title= Advocates Sue Yahoo In Chinese Torture Case | date = 2007-04-20| publisher= The Washington Post | url =https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/18/AR2007041802510.html?hpid=moreheadlines}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Yahoo! executives had testified before the [[House Committee on Foreign Affairs]] that the company was unaware of the nature of the charges against Shi Tao when it gave his personal information to the Chinese government.  However, in the course of the litigation, new evidence came to light that Yahoo! knew what the charges against Shi Tao were and disclosed his identity anyway.&lt;ref name="humanrightsusa.org"/&gt;

In November 2007, Yahoo! was called back to Congress to testify about its actions in China before the bi-partisan House Committee on Foreign Affairs.  The plaintiffs’ families traveled from China to bear witness as the Committee questioned Yahoo!’s executives. Referencing the discrepancy between Yahoo!’s leaders’ testimony in 2006 and the new evidence, the Committee Chair, Representative [[Tom Lantos]], said Yahoo!’s failure to correct the record was inexcusably negligent behavior at best and deliberately deceptive behavior at worst.

Rep. Lantos then told CEO [[Jerry Yang (entrepreneur)|Jerry Yang]] and General Counsel Michael Callahan to beg forgiveness from the families of the detainees. Both men turned and bowed to the women, and publicly apologized.  One week later, Yahoo! and the family settled the lawsuit.&lt;ref name="humanrightsusa.org"/&gt;

Shi Tao and Wang Xiaoning remain in prison.

==Pincus v. Yahoo! Inc.==
'''Pincus v. Yahoo! Inc.''', 13-cv-05326, was a lawsuit filed in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California]]  in [[San Jose, California]]. Brian Pincus was seeking a [[class-action suit]] to represent non-Yahoo  customers whose email address was intercepted by [[Yahoo!]] who allegedly targets ads to increase its revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sandler |first=Linda |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-11-16/yahoo-sued-in-california-for-allegedly-intercepting-e-mails-1-.html |title=Yahoo Sued for Allegedly Intercepting E-Mail |publisher=Bloomberg |date=2013-11-16 |accessdate=2014-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sandler |first=Linda |url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2013-11-18/yahoo-privacy-suit-lawyers-want-judge-who-ruled-against-google |title=Yahoo Privacy Plaintiffs Want Judge Who Ruled Against Google (1) |publisher=Businessweek |date=2013-11-18 |accessdate=2014-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scribd.com/document/185143725/Pincus-v-Yahoo&lt;/ref&gt;
