The '''aestivation hypothesis''', is a hypothesized solution to the [[Fermi paradox]] conceived in 2017 by [[Anders Sandberg]], [[Stuart Armstrong (scientist)|Stuart Armstrong]] and Milan M. Cirkovic. The hypothesis, published on April 27, 2017, suggests that advanced [[alien civilization]]s may be storing energy and [[Aestivation|aestivating]] (hibernating in times of heat instead of cold), until [[Future of an expanding universe|the universe cools]] to better make use of the stored energy to perform tasks.

As the universe cools, the potential work producible by stored energy can increase by a multiplier of 10&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt;. If the goal of an advanced civilization is to maximize the number of calculations done, to generate information processing for tasks like mass-producing simulations, then aestivation would be purposeful to achieve this end.&lt;ref name="arxi_[170"&gt;{{cite arxiv|title=That is not dead which can eternal lie: the aestivation hypothesis for resolving Fermi's paradox|date=2017-04-27|eprint=1705.03394|class=physics.pop-ph|last1=Sandberg|first1=Anders|last2=Armstrong|first2=Stuart|last3=Cirkovic|first3=Milan M}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gizm_Hibe"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Hibernating Aliens Could Explain the Great Silence| last = Dvorsky | first = George| work = Gizmodo| date = 2017-05-31| accessdate = 2018-03-29| url = https://gizmodo.com/hibernating-aliens-could-explain-the-great-silence-1795695445}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="futu_Wher"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Where is alien life?

Advanced alien civilizations may have other intentions. If the intent is creating large amounts of "happiness", then energy resources may be used to generate perfect computer simulations of "the maximal number of maximally happy minds". If the intent is knowledge, resources may be focused on information storage. Such civilizations may go through a time of exploration and then remain [[Dormancy|dormant]] until the conditions of the universe are more energetically favorable to best achieve their objectives.&lt;ref name="arxi_[170"/&gt;

'''Alfred Bult Mullett''' (April 7, 1834 – October 20, 1890) was a British-American [[architect]] who served from 1866 to 1874 as [[Office of the Supervising Architect|Supervising Architect]], head of the [[government agency|agency]] of the [[United States Treasury Department]] that designed [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] government buildings. His work followed trends in [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] style, evolving from the [[Greek Revival]] to [[Second Empire (architecture)|Second Empire]] to [[Richardsonian Romanesque]].

==Life and career==
Mullett was born at [[Taunton]] in [[Somerset]], [[England]]. When he was eight years old, his family emigrated to [[Glendale, Ohio|Glendale]], [[Ohio]], where in 1843 his father bought an 80-acre (32 hectares) farm. He matriculated at Farmers' College in [[College Hill, Cincinnati]], studied [[mathematics]] and mechanical drawing, but left as a sophomore in 1854.&lt;ref name=cincinnatiarchitects&gt;{{cite web|title=M|url=http://www.architecturecincy.org/programs/biographical-dictionary-of-cincinnati-architects/m/|publisher=Architectural Foundation of Cincinnati|accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He trained in the [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]] office of architect [[Isaiah Rogers]] and became a partner, until he left on less than friendly terms in 1860, to establish his own practice. His first known individual design is the Church of the New Jerusalem, a board-and-batten [[Gothic Revival]] church built at Glendale in 1861.

After serving with the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] army, Mullett in 1863 relocated to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] to again work under Rogers, since 1862 the ''[[de facto]]'' Supervising Architect at the [[U.S. Department of the Treasury|Treasury Department]].&lt;ref name=cincinnatiarchitects/&gt; But he undermined his superior's position until an exasperated Rogers resigned in 1865, the year Mullet married Pacific Pearl Myrick. Although widely dismissed as "an obscure draftsman" from Cincinnati, he used political skill to get appointed Supervising Architect in 1866, and so designed [[fireproof]] federal buildings across the nation, particularly [[United States Customs Service|custom house]]s, [[United States Postal Service|post office]]s and [[United States federal courts|courthouses]]. Responsible for contracting local architects and/or construction companies to deal with subcontractors, source materials and other matters, he gained a reputation as a [[micromanaging]] [[authoritarian]] with an explosive temper.

Influenced by the 1864–1868 remodeling of the [[Louvre]]'s [[Pavillon de Flore]]  by [[Hector Lefuel]] and [[Richard Morris Hunt]], Mullett produced six massive fortress-like [[Second Empire (architecture)|Second Empire]] federal buildings in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]], [[New York City|New York]] and Washington D.C., where the [[State, War, and Navy Building]] rose near the [[White House]]. These stone and [[cast iron]] structures, with [[mansard roof]]s and multiple tiers of [[column (architecture)|columns]], were expensive. He was dogged by accusations of extravagance   and subjected to five separate investigations into his ties to the corrupt "Granite Ring".&lt;ref name=elliott/&gt; Mullett reluctantly resigned in 1874 while under attack from reforming [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Treasury Secretary]] [[Benjamin Bristow]] and others.

He was investigated for negligence when three men were killed on May 1, 1877 by a floor failure at the [[City Hall Post Office and Courthouse (New York City)|City Hall Post Office, New York City]]. In 1882, he set up a practice in New York with [[Hugo Kafka]] and [[William G. Steinmetz]], later establishing Alfred B. Mullett &amp; Sons to practice with his two elder sons. But the government never paid him for major commissions, and he remained a popular political target. The ''[[The Sun (New York)|New York Sun]]'' called him "the most arrogant, pretentious, and preposterous little [[humbug]] in the United States."&lt;ref name=elliott&gt;{{cite book|last1=Elliott|first1=Cecil D.|title=The American Architect from the Colonial Era to the Present|date=2002|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9780786413911|pages=76–78|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0P_n3X4fP88C&amp;dq=American+Architect+Present&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=aBUZHcVFSW&amp;sig=ZpVZFk2kZJ6TEZZlgaxnN4Rw8rM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=gkneSYXPL9fslQevzoFa&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Mullett&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1890, in financial trouble and ill health, Mullett killed himself in Washington.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=Antoinette J.|title=Architects to the Nation : The Rise and Decline of the Supervising Architect's Office: The Rise and Decline of the Supervising Architect's Office|date=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195351866|page=107|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=hjDZz87NF8AC&amp;pg=PA74&amp;lpg=PA74&amp;dq=Alfred+B.+Mullett+born+England&amp;source=web&amp;ots=pWB3QkfI_Y&amp;sig=hsQBeIhojwu_EE43v9alnl66le0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Mullett&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over his career he produced some 40 government buildings, and two of the six huge Second Empire piles remain standing in St. Louis and Washington. During the [[Modernist architecture|Modernist period]], critics accused him of using overblown [[ornament (architecture)|ornament]] to hide weak form. The New York City Hall Post Office was dubbed "Mullett's monstrosity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Historic Post Offices: Architectural Masterpieces That Are More than Just Places to Drop Mail|url=http://www.6sqft.com/historic-post-offices-architectural-masterpieces-that-are-more-than-just-places-to-drop-mail/|publisher=6sqft|accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following another shift in popular taste, however, he is recognized for his contribution to monumental Victorian architecture.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9569">An '''algae bioreactor''' is used for cultivating micro or macro algae. Algae may be cultivated for the purposes of [[biomass]] production (as in a [[seaweed cultivator]]), [[wastewater treatment]], [[Carbon fixation|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fixation]], or aquarium/pond filtration in the form of an [[algae scrubber]]. Algae bioreactors vary widely in design, falling broadly into two categories: open reactors and enclosed reactors. Open reactors are exposed to the atmosphere while enclosed reactors, also commonly called [[photobioreactor|photobioreactors]], are isolated to varying extent from the atmosphere. Specifically, algae bioreactors can be used to produce fuels such as biodiesel and bioethanol, to generate animal feed, or to reduce pollutants such as NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in flue gases of power plants.  Fundamentally, this kind of bioreactor is based on the [[Photosynthese|photosynthetic]] reaction which is performed by the [[chlorophyll]]-containing algae itself using dissolved carbon dioxide and sunlight energy. The carbon dioxide is dispersed into the reactor fluid to make it accessible for the algae. The bioreactor has to be made out of transparent material.

The algae are photoautotroph organisms which perform oxygenic photosynthesis.

The equation for photosynthesis:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\mathrm{6\; CO_2 + 6\; H_2O \quad \longrightarrow \;C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6\; O_2} \qquad \Delta H^0 = + 2 870\ \frac{\mathrm{kJ}}{\mathrm{mol}}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

== Historical background ==
Some of the first experiments with the aim of cultivating algae were conducted in 1957 by the "[[Carnegie Institution for Science|Carnegie Institution]]" in Washington. In these experiments, monocellular Chlorella were cultivated by adding CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and some minerals. In the early days, bioreactors were used which were made of glass and later changed to a kind of plastic bag. The goal of all this research has been the cultivation of algae to produce a cheap animal feed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buch-der-synergie.de/c_neu_html/c_04_02_sonne_geschichte_2.htm|title=Achmed Khammas - Das Buch der Synergie - Teil C  - Die Geschichte der Solarenergie|author=|date=|website=www.buch-der-synergie.de|accessdate=17 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Frequently used photo reactor types ==
Nowadays 3 basic types of algae photobioreactors have to be differentiated, but the determining factor is the unifying parameter – the available intensity of sunlight energy.

=== Plate photobioreactor ===
A plate reactor simply consists of vertically arranged or inclined rectangular boxes which are often divided in two parts to effect an agitation of the reactor fluid. Generally these boxes are arranged to a system by linking them. Those connections are also used for making the process of filling/emptying, introduction of gas and transport of nutritive substances, easier. The introduction of the [[flue gas]] mostly occurs at the bottom of the box to ensure that the carbon dioxide has enough time to interact with algae in the reactor fluid.

=== Tubular photobioreactor ===
A tubular reactor consists of vertical or horizontal arranged tubes, connected together to a pipe system. The algae-suspended fluid is able to circulate in this tubing. The tubes are generally made out of transparent plastics or borosilicate glass and the constant circulation is kept up by a pump at the end of the system. The introduction of gas takes place at the end/beginning of the tube system. This way of introducing gas causes the problem of deficiency of carbon dioxide, high concentration of oxygen at the end of the unit during the circulation, and bad efficiency.

=== Bubble column photobioreactor ===
A [[Bubble column reactor|bubble column photo reactor]] consists of vertical arranged cylindrical column, made out of transparent material. The introduction of gas takes place at the bottom of the column and causes a turbulent stream to enable an optimum gas exchange. At present these types of reactors are built with a maximum diameter of 20&amp;nbsp;cm to 30&amp;nbsp;cm in order to ensure the required supply of sunlight energy.

The biggest problem with the sunlight determined construction is the limited size of the diameter. Feuermann et al. {{who|date=August 2010}} invented a method to collect sunlight with a cone shaped collector and transfer it with some fiberglass cables which are adapted to the reactor in order to enable constructions of a column reactor with wider diameters. - on this scale the energy consumption due to pumps etc. and the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cost of manufacture may outweigh the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; captured by the reactor.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

== Industrial usage ==
The cultivation of algae in a photobioreactor creates a narrow range of industrial application possibilities.
Some power companies &lt;ref&gt; {{cite magazine |last= Patel|first= Sonal|date= 5/1/2016|title=A Breakthrough Carbon-Capturing Algae Project|url=https://www.powermag.com/breakthrough-carbon-capturing-algae-project/ |magazine= Powermag|location= Texas, USA |publisher= powermag.com|access-date=16 November 2018 }} &lt;/ref&gt; already established research facilities with algae photobioreactors to find out how efficient they could be in reducing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions, which are contained in [[flue gas]], and how much biomass will be produced. Algae biomass has many uses and can be sold to generate additional income. The saved emission volume can bring an income too, by selling emission credits to other power companies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umweltbundesamt.de/wasser/themen/meere/mikroalgen.htm#Biomasse Umweltbundesamt] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090721022457/http://www.umweltbundesamt.de/wasser/themen/meere/mikroalgen.htm |date=2009-07-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The utilisation of algae as food is very common in East Asian regions. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite magazine |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Algae, The Food That Could Save Humanity |url= https://www.worldcrunch.com/culture-society/algae-the-food-that-could-save-humanity|magazine= Le Monde|location= France|publisher= worldcruch.com|date= 09-07-2016|access-date=16 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the species contain only a fraction of usable proteins and carbohydrates, and a lot of minerals and trace elements. Generally, the consumption of algae should be minimal because of the high iodine content, particularly problematic for those with hyperthyroidism. Likewise, many species of diatomaceous algae produce compounds unsafe for humans.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url=https://www.nwfsc.noaa.gov/sem/phytoplankton.cfm|title=Toxic diatoms |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= 09-01-2014|website= NOAA Northeast Fisheries Science Center|publisher= NOAA |access-date=16 November 2018 |quote= the family Pseudo-nitzschia; under certain conditions these diatoms can produce toxins harmful to humans}}&lt;/ref&gt; The algae, especially some species which contain over 50 percent oil and a lot of carbohydrates, can be used for producing [[biodiesel]] and [[bioethanol]] by extracting and refining the fractions. This point is very interesting, because the algae biomass is generated 30 times faster than some agricultural biomass, &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.pnsc.2014.06.008 |title=Algal biomass as a global source of transport fuels: Overview and development perspectives |journal=Progress in Natural Science: Materials International |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=329–339 |year=2014 |last1=Ullah |first1=Kifayat |last2=Ahmad |first2=Mushtaq |last3=Sofia |last4=Sharma |first4=Vinod Kumar |last5=Lu |first5=Pengmei |last6=Harvey |first6=Adam |last7=Zafar |first7=Muhammad |last8=Sultana |first8=Shazia |last9=Anyanwu |first9=C.N. }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is commonly used for producing biodiesel.

'''Ann Chamberlyne''' (1667–1691), was a female tar (sailor) who joined her brother's ship's crew in 1690 and fought the [[France|French]] at [[Beachy Head]]. A plaque in her memory at [[All Saints Church Cheyne Walk]] in [[London]] used to exist, but it was destroyed in [[World War II]] during a bombing raid.

The plaque stated:
:In an adjoining vault lies Anne, the only Daughter of Edward Chamberlyne, Doctor of Law’s, born in London, 20 January 1667, who having declined marriage at 23, and aspiring to great achievements unusual to her sex, and age, on 30 June 1690, on board a fire ship in man’s clothing, as second Pallas, chaste and fearless, fought ''valiantly'' six hours against the French, under the  command of her Brother.

:Returned from the engagement and after some few months married John Spragg, Esq., with whom, for sixteen more months, she lived most amiably happy. At length, in childbed of a daughter, she encountered death 30 October 1691. This monument, for consort most virtuous and dearly loved, was erected by her husband.

:Snatched, alas, how soon by sudden death, unhonoured by progeny like herself, worthy to rule the Main!”

She is the first known female tar in British history.

'''Brain simulation''' is the concept of creating a functioning [[Computer simulation|computer model]] of a brain or part of a brain. Modelling a brain (or brain subsystem) involves both modelling neurons' electrical and bulk chemical properties (e.g. extracellular [[serotonin]] gradients). A model of the neural connectome of the target organism is also required. The connectome is extremely complex, and its detailed wiring is not yet understood; thus it is presently being modeled empirically in smaller mammals by projects like the [[Blue Brain Project]]. 

The Blue Brain Project intends to create a computer simulation of a mammalian cortical column down to the molecular level.{{citation needed|reason=cellular level seems more viable; molecular level strikes me as unachievable|date=March 2018}} By one estimate, a full reconstruction of the human connectome using the methodology of the Blue Brain Project would require a [[zettabyte]] of data storage.&lt;!-- [[The Brain with David Eagleman]] (2015) has a principal researcher in a Swiss lab face the camera and say this; this surely rivals CERN or LIGO or a complete Hubble-resolution astronomical map --&gt; In 2013, [[Human Brain Project]] created a Brain Simulation Platform (BSP), which is an internet-accessible collaborative platform designed for the simulation of brain models. The Human Brain Project has utilized techniques used by the Blue Brain Project and built upon them.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Human Brain Project, Framework Partnership Agreement https://www.humanbrainproject.eu/documents/10180/538356/FPA++Annex+1+Part+B/41c4da2e-0e69-4295-8e98-3484677d661f&lt;/ref&gt; 

Brain simulation projects intend to contribute to a complete understanding of the brain, and eventually assist the process of treating and diagnosing brain diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.technologynetworks.com/informatics/articles/neuroinformatics-and-the-blue-brain-project-part-1-295850|title=Neuroinformatics and The Blue Brain Project|work=Informatics from Technology Networks|access-date=2018-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The neocortical column is considered the smallest functional unit of the [[neocortex]]. The neocortex is the part of the brain thought to be responsible for higher-order functions like conscious thought, and contains 10,000 neurons in the rat brain (and 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; [[synapse]]s).

Each second of simulated time took ten seconds of computer time. The researchers claimed to observe "biologically consistent" nerve impulses that flowed through the virtual cortex. However, the simulation lacked the structures seen in real mice brains, and they intend to improve the accuracy of the neuron and synapse models.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/6600965.stm |work=[[BBC News]] |date=27 April 2007 |title=Mouse brain simulated on computer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Blue Brain and the rat==

[[Blue Brain]] is a project that was launched in May 2005 by [[IBM]] and the [[École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne|Swiss Federal Institute of Technology]] in [[Lausanne]]. The intention of the project was to create a [[computer simulation]] of a mammalian cortical column down to the molecular level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.forbes.com/technology/sciences/2005/06/06/cx_mh_0606ibm.html| title=IBM Aims To Simulate A Brain| publisher=Forbes| first=Matthew| last=Herper| date=June 6, 2005| accessdate=2006-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project uses a [[supercomputer]] based on IBM's [[Blue Gene]] design to simulate the electrical behavior of neurons based upon their synaptic connectivity and ion permeability. The project seeks to eventually reveal insights into human cognition and various psychiatric disorders caused by malfunctioning neurons, such as [[autism]], and to understand how pharmacological agents affect network behavior.

==Human Brain Project==
The [[Human Brain Project]] (HBP) is a 10-year program of research funded by the [[European Union]]. It began in 2013 and employs around 500 scientists across Europe. It includes 6 platforms: 

*Neuroinformatics (shared databases), 
*Brain Simulation 
*High-Performance Analytics and Computing 
*Medical Informatics (patient database) 
*Neuromorphic Computing (brain-inspired computing)  
*Neurorobotics (robotic simulations).

The Brain Simulation Platform (BSP) is a device for internet-accessible tools, which allows investigations that are not possible in the laboratory. They are applying Blue Brain techniques to other brain regions, such as the cerebellum, hippocampus, and the basal ganglia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brain Simulation Platform|url=https://www.humanbrainproject.eu/en/brain-simulation/brain-simulation-platform/|website=Human Brain Project|accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''central [[Governor (device)|governor]]''' is a proposed process in the brain that regulates exercise in regard to a neurally calculated safe  exertion by the body. In particular, physical activity is controlled so that its intensity cannot threaten the body’s [[homeostasis]] by causing [[Hypoxia (medical)|anoxic]] damage to the [[Myocardial ischemia|heart muscle]]. The central governor limits exercise by reducing the neural recruitment of muscle fibers. This reduced recruitment causes the sensation of [[muscle fatigue|fatigue]]. The existence of a central governor was suggested to explain fatigue after prolonged strenuous exercise in long-distance running and other endurance sports, but its ideas could also apply to other causes of exertion-induced fatigue.

The existence of a central governor was proposed by [[Tim Noakes]] in 1997, but a similar idea was suggested in 1924 by [[Archibald Hill]].

In contrast to this idea is the one that fatigue is due to peripheral ‘limitation’ or ‘catastrophe’. In this view, regulation by fatigue occurs as a consequence of a failure of homeostasis directly in muscles.

== History ==

=== Archibald Hill ===
The 1922 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] winner [[Archibald Hill]] proposed in 1924 that the heart was protected from anoxia in strenuous exercise by the existence of a governor.

{{quote|the heart is able to regulate its output, to some extent, in accordance with the degree of saturation of the arterial blood ... we suggest that, in the body (either in the heart muscle itself or in the nervous system), there is some mechanism which causes a slowing of the circulation as soon as a serious degree of unsaturation occurs, and ''vice versa''. This mechanism would tend, to some degree, to act as a ‘governor’, maintaining a reasonably high degree of saturation of the blood: the breathing of a gas mixture rich in oxygen would produce a greater degree of saturation of the blood and so allow the output to increase until the ‘governor’ stopped it again. We realise the danger of a hypothesis partly suggested by teleological reasoning: in this case, however, we can see no other explanation of our experimental results pp. 161-163&lt;ref&gt;Hill, A. V., Long, C. N. H. and Lupton, H. (1924). [http://journals.royalsociety.org/content/k51611345m783727/fulltext.pdf  Muscular exercise, lactic acid and the supply and utilisation of oxygen] {{Webarchive|url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090319234718/http://journals.royalsociety.org/content/k51611345m783727/fulltext.pdf# |date=2009-03-19 }}. Parts I–III. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. 97, 438–475.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

This hypothesis was disregarded and further research upon exercise fatigue was modeled in terms of it being due to a mechanical failure of the exercising muscles ("peripheral muscle fatigue"). This failure was caused either by an inadequate oxygen supply to the exercising muscles, lactic acid buildup, or total energy depletion in the exhausted muscles.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards RHT.

=== Tim Noakes ===
[[Tim Noakes]], a professor of exercise and sports science at the [[University of Cape Town]], in 1997&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Noakes | first1 = T. D. | title = 1996 J.B.

In his approach, the power output by muscles during exercise is continuously adjusted in regard to calculations made by the brain in regard to a safe level of exertion. These neural calculations factor in earlier experience with strenuous exercise, the planning duration of the exercise, and the present metabolic state of the body. These brain models&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

This process, though occurring in the brain, is outside conscious control.

{{quote | the rising perception of discomfort produced by exhausting exercise progressively reduces the conscious desire to over-ride this control mechanism, which, if it were to be reduced, would lead to the recruitment of more motor units. Thus the presence of conscious over-ride would be undesirable because it would increase or maintain the exercise intensity, thereby threatening homoeostasis ... as exercise performance is centrally regulated by the CNS, then fatigue should no longer be considered a physical event but rather a sensation or emotion, separate from an overt physical manifestation—for example, the reduction in force output by the active muscles. Rather we now suggest that the physical manifestation of any increasing perception of fatigue may simply be an alteration in the subconsciously regulated pace at which the exercise is performed. Hence the novel suggestion is that the conventional understanding of fatigue is flawed because it makes no distinction between the sensation itself and the physical expression of that sensation which, we suggest, is the alteration in the subconsciously regulated pacing strategy consequent on changing motor unit recruitment/derecruitment by the CNS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = St Clair Gibson | first1 = A. | last2 = Lambert | first2 = M.

Noakes created the idea of the central governor in the context of prolonged endurance running. However, he has noted that the central processes involved might also underlie the existence of other kinds of fatigue:

{{quote | This new interpretation is the first to allow a more reasonable description of a number of phenomena that defy rational explanation according to the traditional ‘‘limitations’’ models of fatigue. These include, among many others, the chronic fatigue syndrome, in which affected individuals experience evident fatigue at rest, and the role of psychological and motivational factors,  centrally (brain) acting pharmaceutical agents,  hypnosis, shouting or sudden unexpected gunshots,  or other forms of distraction including music or premeditated deception on human exercise performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = St Clair Gibson | first1 = A. | last2 = Lambert | first2 = M.

In support of this, placebos (which must be mediated by a central process) have a powerful effect upon not only fatigue in prolonged exercise,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Clark | first1 = V.R. | last2 = Hopkins | first2 = W.G. | last3 = Hawley | first3 = J.A. | last4 = Burke | first4 = L.M. | year = 2000 | title = Placebo effect of carbohydrate feeding during a 40-km cycling time trial | url = | journal = Med.

== Criticisms ==
The existence of a central governor over physiology has been questioned since ‘physiological catastrophes’ can and do occur in athletes (important examples in [[marathons]] have been [[Dorando Pietri]], [[James Peters (athlete)|Jim Peters]] and [[Gabriela Andersen-Schiess]]). This suggests that humans can over-ride ‘the central governor’.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Esteve-Lanao | first1 = J. | last2 = Lucia | first2 = A. | last3 = Dekoning | first3 = J.

Exercise fatigue has also been attributed to the direct effects of exercise upon the brain such as increased cerebral levels of [[serotonin]], reduced level of [[glutamate]] secondary to uptake of ammonia in the brain, brain hyperthermia, and [[glycogen]] depletion in brain cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Dalsgaard | first1 = M.

He was reported missing by his family after he failed to show up to work.

In November 2016, the [[Attorney General of New South Wales|New South Wales Attorney General]] agreed to an immunity deal with Atkins, which protected him from perjury in exchange for leading police to Leveson's remains. The search began on 10 November, but was called off on 17 November, after no leads were found. Police resumed searching on 25 May 2017 and discovered Leveson's remains on 31 May. An inquest into his death delivered an open finding on 5 December, with the deputy state coroner stating there was insufficient evidence to determine how or why Leveson died.

==Disappearance==
Leveson was at Arq nightclub in [[Darlinghurst, New South Wales]], in the early morning of 23 September 2007, with close friends and his boyfriend, 45-year-old Michael Peter Atkins. He was last seen on [[CCTV]] leaving the club at around 2 am with Atkins.

==Investigation==

===Arrest and trial===
On 5 August 2008, Atkins was arrested at his apartment in [[Cronulla]] and charged with murder.&lt;ref name="AtkinsArrested"/&gt;

On 3 September 2009, Atkins's trial began in the [[Supreme Court of New South Wales]].&lt;ref name="ABCTimeline"/&gt; On 20 October, the jury found Atkins not guilty of murder and an alternative charge of manslaughter.&lt;ref name="NotGuilty"/&gt;

===Search for and discovery of remains===

&lt;!-- On 15 January 2015, the inquest into the presumed death of Leveson resumed.

On 8 December 2015, a police interview with Atkins was shown to the court.

On 5 December 2017, the deputy state coroner, Elaine Truscott, delivered an open finding at the inquest of Leveson's death.

"'''Diddle Diddle Dumpling'''" is the fifth episode of the third series of the British [[black comedy]] [[anthology series|anthology]] television series ''[[Inside No. 9]]''. It was written by [[Steve Pemberton]] and [[Reece Shearsmith]], and first aired on 14 March 2017, on [[BBC Two]]. The episode, which was directed by [[Guillem Morales]], follows the story of David, played by Shearsmith, a [[middle class]] [[stay-at-home dad]], who happens across a lone black shoe. Much to the concern of his wife Louise, played by [[Keeley Hawes]], he becomes obsessed with finding the shoe's owner. The episode follows the development of his obsession. Rosa Strudwick plays Sally, David and Louise's daughter, and Pemberton plays Chris, a family friend. [[Danny Baker]] voices a radio presenter, and [[Mathew Baynton]] also appears.

The episode was inspired by Pemberton's own chance encounter with a single shoe. The episode is split into four, corresponding to the four seasons, and features extracts of [[Vivaldi]]'s ''[[The Four Seasons (Vivaldi)|The Four Seasons]]''. The cinematography features many views of symmetrical pairs of objects, as well as shots of empty rooms. The device of the seasons, as well as the music and cinematography, relate to David's emotional state. Critics responded very positively to "Diddle Diddle Dumpling", particularly praising Morales's direction and the performances of Shearsmith, Hawes, and Baynton.

==Production==
The third series of ''Inside No. 9'' was announced in October 2015, and heavily publicised in January 2016, at which time [[Keeley Hawes]] and [[Mathew Baynton]] were named as guest stars in the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Inside No. 9 gets a third series|publisher=[[RadioTimes.com]]|accessdate=19 March 2017|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2015-10-21/inside-no-9-gets-a-third-series}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;Ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Dowell, Ben|date=20 January 2016|title=Keeley Hawes and Jessica Raine to star in the new series of Inside No. 9|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2016-01-20/keeley-hawes-and-jessica-raine-to-star-in-the-new-series-of-inside-no-9|publisher=[[RadioTimes.com]]|accessdate=19 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Travis, Ben|date=20 January 2016|title=Inside No 9: Keeley Hawes, Philip Glenister, and Morgana Robinson confirmed as Series 3 starts shooting|newspaper=[[Evening Standard]]|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/stayingin/tvfilm/inside-no-9-keeley-hawes-philip-glenister-and-morgana-robinson-confirmed-as-series-3-starts-shooting-a3160831.html|accessdate=19 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Diddle Diddle Dumpling" was the fifth and penultimate episode of the series, and the fourth of a run of five episodes beginning February 2017—the series's first episode being the December 2016 [[Christmas special]] "[[The Devil of Christmas]]". It first aired on 14 March 2017, on [[BBC Two]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Inside No. 9 series 3|url=https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/inside_no_9/episodes/3/|publisher=[[British Comedy Guide]]|accessdate=13 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Diddle Diddle Dumpling" was inspired by a chance encounter that Pemberton had with a single shoe on his way to work,&lt;ref name="Connor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chortle"/&gt; leading him to consider the result of someone obsessively attempting to return it to its rightful owner.&lt;ref name="Chortle"/&gt; He claimed that the episode's premise then came to him "fully formed".&lt;ref name="Connor"/&gt; He took Shearsmith to see the shoe, and the pair began writing the episode immediately.&lt;ref name="Connor"/&gt; Coincidentally, Shearsmith also encountered a single shoe some days later, though it did not match the first.&lt;Ref name="Chortle"/&gt; "You start seeing them everywhere", Shearsmith noted, "once you start looking".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Semlyen, Nick De|date=29 December 2016|title=Inside information|url=https://www.pressreader.com/uk/empire-uk/20161229/281861528164559|magazine=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]|accessdate=13 May 2017|via=PressReader.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Pemberton, this inspiration worked because it was completely random; were he to have gone out look for inspiration, he claimed, it would not have worked.&lt;Ref name="Connor"/&gt; The episode is split into four, corresponding to the four seasons, and features music from [[Vivaldi]]'s ''[[The Four Seasons (Vivaldi)|The Four Seasons]]''.&lt;ref name="Butler"/&gt; It takes its name from the [[nursery rhyme]] "[[Diddle, Diddle, Dumpling, My Son John]]".&lt;ref name="Owen"/&gt;

"Diddle Diddle Dumpling" starred Shearsmith as David, Hawes as David's wife Louise, Rosa Strudwick as the couple's daughter Sally, and Pemberton as Chris, a family friend. [[Danny Baker]] voiced a radio presenter, and Baynton appeared as Ted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diddle Diddle Dumpling|publisher=BBC|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b08jlm8p|accessdate=24 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; When contacted about appearing in ''Inside No. 9'', Hawes was starring in ''[[The Durrells]]''. However, as "Diddle Diddle Dumpling" would take only a week to film, she was able to move straight from ''The Durrells'' to ''Inside No. 9''. Her respective characters, despite having close names, were very different.&lt;ref name="Hawes"/&gt; According to Pemberton, Hawes had hoped to dislike the script so that she could turn down the role. When she read it, however, she could not resist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Inside No. 9|publisher=[[British Comedy Guide]]|date=19 February 2017|accessdate=24 December 2017|url=https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/inside_no_9/interview/steve_pemberton_and_reece_shearsmith/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Inside No 9 'jealousy' over top cast|newspaper=[[The Irish News]]|date=13 February 2017|accessdate=24 December 2017|url=https://www.irishnews.com/magazine/2017/02/13/news/inside-no-9-jealousy-over-top-cast-929906/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Diddle Diddle Dumpling" was the ''Inside No. 9'' producer [[Adam Tandy]]'s favourite episode of the series,&lt;Ref name="Chortle"/&gt; while Pemberton considered it one of the best.&lt;Ref name="Connor"/&gt; Shearsmith identified David as one of his favourite characters from the series, and said that he fondly remembered working with Hawes, whom he praised as a performer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Inside No.9 - Series three|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/mediapacks/insideno9/reece-steve|date=14 February 2017|accessdate=24 December 2017|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hawes commended ''Inside No. 9'', the episode's script, and Morales's direction, expressing how much she had enjoyed working with Pemberton and Shearsmith, as well as the amount she had laughed during the filming process.&lt;ref name="Hawes"/&gt;

}}
;Spring
David, a [[middle class]] [[stay-at-home dad]], lives with his wife Louise and daughter Sally. While out [[jogging]], he encounters a single [[Slip-on shoe|slip-on]] [[dress shoe]]. David keeps an eye on the shoe, and, by the time Louise arrives home that evening, has moved it to the dinner table. Louise drops it on the floor, though David's attention remains on it. Later, in daytime, David chastises Sally for playing with the shoe, and Louise is angry that he has hung posters advertising his find that feature their phone number.

;Summer
The family celebrate Sally's birthday, while the shoe sits under a sofa. Later, Chris, a family friend, visits. He may have a job for David, but, to Louise's horror, David begins talking about his "project". Louise has [[Rubbish bin|binned]] the shoe; David is mortified, and Louise challenges him to not speak about the shoe for two minutes. He fails, and storms out to search the bin. Louise and Chris share a tender moment, but David does not notice; he is more concerned with how Chris could help him publicise his search for the shoe's owner. David's [[multimedia]] campaign and [[Bounty (reward)|reward]] offer, initially unsuccessful, ultimately result in a visit from a young man who has a matching shoe. David interrogates him at length. Once satisfied by his account, and having spent a final few moments alone with the newly matched pair, he reluctantly hands it over, holding back tears.

;Autumn
Sally and Louise are happy in the kitchen, when David, smartly dressed and with a confident manner, returns from work. Despite Louise's reservations, Sally performs a piece she will present in her [[school assembly]], involving the [[nursery rhyme]] "[[Diddle, Diddle, Dumpling, My Son John|Diddle, Diddle, Dumpling]]":

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Diddle, diddle, dumpling, my son John,
Went to bed with his trousers on!
One shoe off, and one shoe on,
Diddle, diddle, dumpling, my son John!
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Despite a pained expression, David applauds, hugging his daughter.

;Winter
Louise encounters the shoe outside her house. Inside, David confronts her about a photograph he has found—Louise's college friend, Ted, is the man to whom David gave the shoe. He has also found a receipt for a new set of shoes, bought by Louise shortly before Ted's visit. David accuses Louise of giving him false hope, and, in response to her exasperation, says that it was never about the shoe. David is in grief, having never recovered from the death of Sally's twin brother, Joseph, six years earlier. Like the shoes, the children were "Two halves ... and one of them's gone", though he believes that "they should be together". Louise finds blood on David's hands, but it is not his own. He had driven to [[Norfolk]] to retrieve the shoe from Ted, but does not remember what he has done. The [[emergency services]] arrive outside.

On a cabinet is a photograph of a smiling David holding two infants. He is wearing the shoes. Over the credits, security footage from 15 March 2016 shows David placing the shoe outside his house before jogging away.

==Analysis==
[[File:Vivaldi.jpg|thumb|right|The episode uses ''The Four Seasons'', by Vivaldi ''(pictured)'' to mark changing seasons and David's changing mental state.]]
"Diddle Diddle Dumpling", with David's obsessive search for the shoe's owner, offered a "macabre reimagining" of ''[[Cinderella]]'' for Sean O'Grady of ''[[The Independent]]''.&lt;ref name="O'Grady"/&gt; The journalist [[Andrew Billen]], on the other hand, said that the episode did not present the shoe as an allusion to ''Cinderella'' or so that viewers might wait to hear "the other shoe drop".&lt;ref name="Billen"/&gt; Instead, the shoe is presented as "lonesome aberration", and, on at least one occasion, is actively [[anthropomorphised]] by David.&lt;ref name="Billen"/&gt; The comedy critic [[Bruce Dessau]] identified "stories of men who marry their VW Golfs or women who fancy the Eiffel Tower" as something he initially thought an inspiration, and noted ''[[The Good Life (1975 TV series)|The Good Life]]'' as a potential influence for David and Louise's lifestyle. However, the episode diverged strongly from what he had expected, as David's obsession did not involve romantic love, and the episode as a whole was low on humour.&lt;Ref name="Dessau"/&gt; "Diddle Diddle Dumpling" is a relatively simple episode, described by one critic as "really just a quiet character study of a man losing his grip".&lt;ref name="Owen"/&gt;

The episode uses Vivaldi's ''The Four Seasons'' to mark the passage of time,&lt;ref name="Owen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mellor"/&gt; which is also portrayed by changing [[Color scheme|colour palettes]].&lt;ref name="Mellor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Butler"/&gt; The score and setting convey David's emotional and mental fragility,&lt;ref name="Owen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mellor"/&gt; with a contrast drawn between the chaotic music and controlled cinematography.&lt;ref name="Mellor"/&gt; The seasons, too, convey David's mental state: first the decline, then the "autumnal calm", then the collapse.&lt;Ref name="Butler"/&gt;

The episode's closing scene is, according to several critics, ambiguous, as it is unclear whether David has visited violence on Ted or on Sally.&lt;ref name="Butler"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mellor"/&gt; Similarly, the nature of Louise's relationships with both Ted and Chris is open to interpretation: one critic noted the "little moment" of Louise's interaction with Chris, and questioned whether David might believe Louise to be having an affair with Ted.&lt;ref name="Butler"/&gt;

The family's home has a "sterile" feeling,&lt;ref name="Dessau"/&gt; and features a large number of objects in symmetrical pairs.&lt;ref name="Dessau"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mellor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Owen"/&gt; This ''[[mise-en-scène]]'' reflects "David's psychosis, and what he and Louise [have] lost in the death of Sally's twin brother".&lt;ref name="Mellor"/&gt; Relatedly, shots of unoccupied rooms create a sense of emptiness, while the final shot of Ted shows him as a "half person".&lt;ref name="Mellor"/&gt; Critics identified the direction as [[Alfred Hitchcock|Hitchcockian]],&lt;Ref name="O'Grady2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Butler"/&gt; while Tandy characterised it as [[Ingmar Bergman|Bergmanesque]].&lt;ref name="Chortle"/&gt;

The "number 9" of "Diddle Diddle Dumpling" was not the family home, but the shoe, which was [[Shoe size#United Kingdom and Ireland|size 9]].&lt;ref name="Mellor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rifkind"/&gt; Despite taking place in a small number of rooms or just outside, the episode does not have the feeling of [[claustrophobia]] that is present in some other episodes.&lt;ref name="O'Grady"/&gt; "Diddle Diddle Dumpling" represented a sharp change of tone from the previous episode of ''Inside No. 9'', "[[Empty Orchestra]]".&lt;ref name="Dessau"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mellor"/&gt; For Mark Butler of ''[[I (newspaper)|i]]'', the episode's melancholic mood, uneasy domestic setting, and allusions to [[mental illness]] link it to "[[Tom &amp; Gerri]]", an episode from ''Inside No. 9''{{'s}} first series.&lt;Ref name="Butler"/&gt;

"Diddle Diddle Dumpling" was very well received by critics, some of whom characterised it as an improvement on the weaker "Empty Orchestra".&lt;ref name="McDowall"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Watson"/&gt; Dessau identified it as a "terrific instalment",&lt;ref name="Dessau"/&gt; while O'Grady discussed it as a key example of how high-quality television continues to survive in the 21st century, as part of "a renaissance in British comedy".&lt;ref name="O'Grady"/&gt; It was, for him, comparable with the best of Shearsmith and Pemberton's previous work;&lt;ref name="O'Grady2"/&gt; Billen, similarly, characterised it as one of the best episodes of ''Inside No. 9''.&lt;Ref name="Billen"/&gt; For the freelance critic Dan Owen, "Diddle Diddle Dumpling" was a "characteristically rich and rewarding experience",&lt;ref name="Owen"/&gt; for Patrick Smith of the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'', it was a "delicious slice of macabre humour",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Smith, Patrick|date=11 March 2017|title=What to watch|newspaper=Review, [[Daily Telegraph]]|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for Hannah J Davies, of [[TheGuardian.com]], it was "excellent", even if "not the strongest episode of the series".&lt;ref name="Davies"/&gt; Mark Butler, of [[inews.co.uk]], said that the episode "managed to weave a genuinely gripping and powerful half hour of TV from a seemingly bizarre and banal set-up: a testament to [''Inside No. 9''{{'s}}] ongoing mastery of mood".&lt;ref name="Butler"/&gt;

Julie McDowall, of ''[[The National (Scotland)|The National]]'', called it "a brilliantly slow, creeping and sinister episode".&lt;ref name="McDowall"/&gt; Similarly, Victoria Segal and Helen Stewart of ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' praised the way that the episode "builds up an atmosphere of creeping dread", but were critical of the "slightly tasteless conclusion" to which the episode "dribbles".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Segal, Victoria; Stewart, Helen|title=Critics' choice|newspaper=[[The Sunday Times]]|date=12 March 2017|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/tuesday-wlqhqlkwr|accessdate=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the sister paper ''[[The Times]]'', however, Billen praised the conclusion, saying it "brought with it a tide of distress";&lt;Ref name="Billen"/&gt; on the website of ''The Times'', Hugo Rifkind characterised the ending as somewhat anticlimatic, suggesting that the best mysteries are never solved.&lt;ref name="Rifkind"/&gt; Also writing for ''The Times'', Chris Bennion praised the "near genius" premise, calling the episode a "witty glimpse of midlife inadequacy" that became darker as it progressed.&lt;ref name="Bennion"/&gt; Butler identified the device of the shifting seasons as "a clever and striking touch", characterising the episode as moving from "laugh out loud" humour to "profoundly uncomfortable" interactions, with a "hard to swallow" and "disquieting" conclusion.&lt;ref name="Butler"/&gt;

Morales's direction received high praise,&lt;ref name="Mulkern"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Owen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Butler"/&gt; as did the performances of Hawes, Baynton, and especially Shearsmith.&lt;ref name="Mulkern"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Owen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Butler"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Watson"/&gt; Bennion, though, suggested that Hawes and Baynton were "somewhat underused".&lt;ref name="Bennion"/&gt;

[[File:Jim Shane Michael Dunn Wild Wild West 1968.JPG|thumb|Michael Dunn as Dr. Loveless in "The Night of Miguelito's Revenge" showing Loveless newest invention-an android]]
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Dr Loveless beaker.jpg|thumb|Michael Dunn as Dr. Loveless "The Night of the Raven"{{deletable image-caption|Thursday, 30 March 2017}}]] --&gt;
'''Dr. Miguelito Quixote Loveless''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] who appeared in 10 episodes of the 1960s television series ''[[The Wild Wild West]]''. He is a brilliant (though insane) character born with [[dwarfism]], portrayed by character actor [[Michael Dunn (actor)|Michael Dunn]].{{cn|date=April 2018}} As a [[mad scientist]], Dr. Loveless conceived numerous plots which were always foiled by [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agents [[James T. West|James West]] and [[Artemus Gordon]]; the first two episodes showed him being caught and going to jail, although after the third episode he always escaped capture. 

Loveless' family had received a valuable [[land grant]] in [[California]] from the Spanish [[Viceroy of Mexico]]. Their land was taken back by the Spanish Crown; and then irretrievably lost however, when California became part of the [[United States]]. His original goal was to recover his family's property and create a haven where the disadvantaged (presumably financially and, like himself, physically) could live without torment from society. As the series progressed, however, he became more and more [[megalomaniac]]al. West is able to defeat Loveless by using Loveless own ego against him. In "The Night of the Bogus Bandits", it is revealed that Loveless' greatest fear is not death, but the fact that once deceased, he cannot continue his plans of revenge against a society which he hates so much.

Loveless was known as a [[technology|technological]] [[genius]], producing gadgets far ahead of his time-which his enemy James West acknowledges {"The Night Dr. Loveless Died"}. Dr. Loveless is addicted to the very rare Napoleon Brandy Le Grande {"The Night of Miguelito's Revenge"}. In the series' first season, his inventions were more practical, anticipating the cathode-ray tube, the airplane, penicllin; automobile ("The Night the Wizard shook the Earth"] and a synthesized LSD-like hallucinogen. In the second season, the inventions became more fantastic and included a powder that shrank Jim West to one-twelfth his original size and a device that allowed people to enter paintings. Perhaps the most phantasmagorical of his methods for avoiding capture was when he and his lovely assistant Antoinette (Phoebe Dorin) escaped West and Gordon by shrinking themselves and flying away on the back of a swan. {"The Night of the Raven"}. In the last episode which he appeared, Dr Loveless escaped by using a circus cannon to shoot him into space; the only trace of him is his circus ringmasters uniform on the ground along with a recording promising West that they will meet again. {"The Night of Miguelito's Revenge"]

According to the [[1979 in television|1979]] [[TV movie]] ''[[The Wild Wild West Revisited]]'', in 1880, Loveless eventually died of ulcers resulting from anger and frustration at having his plans consistently ruined by West and Gordon. ([[Michael Dunn (actor)|Michael Dunn]] died in 1973.) As a result, Loveless' son Michelito (played by [[Paul Williams (songwriter)|Paul Williams]]) subsequently seeks revenge on the agents.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

==Appearances==
Loveless was created by writer John Kneubuhl after he read a magazine article about Dunn. The character was introduced in the [[1965 in television|1965]] episode "The Night the Wizard Shook The Earth," which was the show's third televised episode (although it was produced sixth). Loveless became an immediate hit and Dunn appeared in ten episodes over four seasons, Kneubuhl writing five of them.

==Accomplices==
Dr. Loveless initially had two companions: the hulking Voltaire (played by real-life giant [[Richard Kiel]]) and the beautiful songstress Antoinette (portrayed by Dunn's nightclub-act singing partner [[Phoebe Dorin]]). Voltaire disappeared after the doctor's third encounter with the agents; Antoinette, after the sixth. However, they each left such an indelible impression on fans that the 1990 comic book miniseries from [[Millennium Publications]], a sequel to rather than an adaptation of the TV program scripted by [[Mark Ellis (American author)|Mark Ellis]] with art by [[Darryl Banks]], included both characters.

==Other versions==
Loveless was adapted for the 1999 feature film ''[[Wild Wild West (film)|Wild Wild West]]'' as Dr. Arliss Loveless, played by [[Kenneth Branagh]].{{cn|date=April 2018}} Branagh's version was a former Confederate military engineer who had lost most of his lower body in an accidental explosion. As a double amputee he used a steam-powered [[wheelchair]] and similar innovative contraptions. Loveless was incensed at the South's surrender and sought to dismember the United States and distribute its territory amongst the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes and its original European colonizers (while keeping the [[Loveless Land|Northern Plains]] for himself). He also has a personal history with Jim West; an early tank he designed massacred the population of a freed slave colony, including West's parents (in the film, West, portrayed by [[Will Smith]], is [[African-American]]).

A '''drug overdose''' (or simply '''overdose''' or '''OD''') is the [[ingestion]] or application of a [[drug]] or other substance in quantities greater than are recommended&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treatment-now.com/resources/definitions/ Definitions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110227202513/http://www.treatment-now.com/resources/definitions/ |date=2011-02-27 }} Retrieved on 20 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; or generally practiced.&lt;ref name="uphs"&gt;[http://www.uphs.upenn.edu/addiction/berman/glossary/ "Stairway to Recovery: Glossary of Terms"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709032249/http://www.uphs.upenn.edu/addiction/berman/glossary/ |date=2011-07-09 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; An overdose may result in a [[toxicity|toxic state]] or [[death]].&lt;ref name="uphs"/&gt;

==Classification==
The word "overdose" implies that there is a common safe dosage and usage for the drug; therefore, the term is commonly only applied to drugs, not [[poison]]s, even though poisons are harmless at a low enough dosage. Drug overdoses are sometimes caused intentionally to commit [[suicide]], [[parasuicide]] or as [[self-harm]], but many drug overdoses are accidental, the result of intentional or unintentional misuse of medication. Intentional misuse leading to overdose can include using prescribed or unprescribed drugs in excessive quantities in an attempt to produce [[euphoria]].

Usage of [[illicit drugs]] of unexpected purity, in large quantities, or after a period of drug [[abstinence]] can also induce overdose. [[Cocaine]] users who [[Injection (medicine)#Intravenous infusion|inject intravenously]] can easily overdose accidentally, as the margin between a pleasurable drug sensation and an overdose is small.&lt;ref&gt;Study on [http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/7/31 fatal overdose] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119041854/http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/7/31 |date=2012-01-19 }} in New-York City 1990-2000, visited May 11, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Unintentional misuse can include errors in dosage caused by failure to read or understand product labels. Accidental overdoses may also be the result of over-prescription, failure to recognize a drug's active ingredient, or unwitting ingestion by children.&lt;ref&gt;"What to do with leftover medicines". ''Medicines Talk'', Winter 2005. Available at {{cite web|url=http://www.nps.org.au/consumers/publications/medicines_talk/mt14/what_to_do_with_left-over_medicines2 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091024010012/https://www.nps.org.au/consumers/publications/medicines_talk/mt14/what_to_do_with_left-over_medicines2 |archivedate=2009-10-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A common unintentional overdose in young children involves multi-vitamins containing iron. [[Iron]] is a component of the [[hemoglobin]] [[molecule]] in [[blood]], used to transport [[oxygen]] to living cells. When taken in small amounts, iron allows the body to replenish hemoglobin, but in large amounts it causes severe [[pH]] imbalances in the body. If this overdose is not treated with [[chelation therapy]], it can lead to death or a permanent [[coma]]. The term 'overdose' is often misused as a descriptor for [[adverse drug reaction]]s or negative [[drug interaction]]s due to [[polypharmacy|mixing multiple drugs simultaneously]].

Signs and symptoms of an overdose vary depending on the drug or exposure to toxins.  The symptoms can often be divided into differing [[toxidrome]]s.  This can help one determine what class of drug or toxin is causing the difficulties.

Symptoms of opioid overdoses include slow breathing, heart rate and pulse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chandler|first=Stephanie|title=Symptoms of an opiate overdose|url=http://www.livestrong.com/article/68582-symptoms-opiate-overdose/|publisher=Live Strong|accessdate=17 May 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120418164856/http://www.livestrong.com/article/68582-symptoms-opiate-overdose/|archivedate=18 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opioid overdoses can also cause pinpoint pupils, and blue lips and nails due to low levels of [[oxygen]] in the blood. A person experiencing an [[opioid overdose]] might also have muscle spasms, [[seizures]] and decreased consciousness. A person experiencing an opiate overdose usually will not wake up even if their name is called or if they are shaken vigorously.

==Diagnosis==
[[File:Woodstock festival medical.jpg|thumb|A music fan who has had a drug overdose at the 2008 [[Woodstock Festival (Poland)]] is strapped into a wheeled cot by paramedics.]]
The substance that has been taken may often be determined by asking the person.  However, if they will not, or cannot, due to an [[altered level of consciousness]], provide this information, a search of the home or questioning of friends and family may be helpful.

Examination for [[toxidrome]]s, drug testing, or laboratory test may be helpful. Other laboratory test such as [[glucose]], [[urea]] and [[electrolyte]]s, [[paracetamol]] levels and [[salicylate]] levels are typically done.

The distribution of [[naloxone]] to [[injection drug users]] and other [[opioid]] drug users decreases the risk of death from overdose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Piper TM |title=Evaluation of a naloxone distribution and administration program in New York City |journal=Subst Use Misuse |volume=43 |issue=7 |pages=858–870 |year=2008 |pmid=18570021 |doi=10.1080/10826080701801261 |url= |author2=Stancliff S |author3=Rudenstine S |display-authors=3 |last4=Sherman |first4=Susan |last5=Nandi |first5=Vijay |last6=Clear |first6=Allan |last7=Galea |first7=Sandro}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) estimates that U.S. programs for drug users and their caregivers prescribing take-home doses of naloxone and training on its utilization are estimated to have prevented 10,000 opioid overdose deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Community-Based Opioid Overdose Prevention Programs Providing Naloxone — United States, 2010|journal=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|date=December 2010|url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6106a1.htm|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170909005149/https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6106a1.htm|archivedate=2017-09-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Healthcare institution-based naloxone prescription programs have also helped reduce rates of opioid overdose in the [[U.S. state]] of [[North Carolina]], and have been replicated in the U.S. military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Albert S, Brason FW 2nd, Sanford CK, Dasgupta N, Graham J, Lovette B.|title=Project Lazarus: community-based overdose prevention in rural North Carolina|journal=Pain Medicine|date=June 2011|pmid=21668761|doi=10.1111/j.1526-4637.2011.01128.x|volume=12 Suppl 2|pages=S77–85}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Beletsky L, Burris S, Kral AH |title=Closing Death's Door: Action Steps to Facilitate Emergency Opioid Drug Overdose Reversal in the United States|journal=Center for Health Law, Policy and Practice, Temple University School of Law|date=July 2009|ssrn=1437163|accessdate=|doi=10.2139/ssrn.1437163}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, scale-up of healthcare-based opioid overdose interventions is limited by providers' insufficient knowledge and negative attitudes towards prescribing take-home naloxone to prevent opioid overdose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Beletsky L, Ruthazer R, Macalino GE, Rich JD, Tan L, Burris S |title=Physicians' knowledge of and willingness to prescribe naloxone to reverse accidental opiate overdose: challenges and opportunities|journal=Journal of Urban Health|date=January 2007|pmid=17146712|doi=10.1007/s11524-006-9120-z|volume=84|issue=1|pmc=2078257|pages=126–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Programs training police and fire personnel in opioid overdose response using naloxone have also shown promise in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lavoie D.|title=Naloxone: Drug-Overdose Antidote Is Put In Addicts' Hands|journal=Huffington Post|date=April 2012|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/26/naloxone-drug-overdose-antidote_n_1456531.html|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120518161613/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/26/naloxone-drug-overdose-antidote_n_1456531.html|archivedate=2012-05-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==
[[File:CharcoalPO.jpg|thumb|[[Activated carbon]] is a commonly used agent for [[decontamination]] of the [[Human gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal tract]] in overdoses.]]
Stabilization of the victim's airway, breathing, and circulation ([[ABC (medicine)|ABCs]]) is the initial treatment of an overdose. Ventilation is considered when there is a low respiratory rate or when [[blood gases]] show the person to be [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxic]]. Monitoring of the patient should continue before and throughout the treatment process, with particular attention to temperature, [[pulse]], [[respiratory rate]], [[blood pressure]], urine output, [[electrocardiography]] (ECG) and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; saturation.&lt;ref name="OHCM"&gt;{{cite book |title=Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine |last=Longmore |first=Murray |author2=Ian Wilkinson |author3=Tom Turmezei |author4=Chee Kay Cheung  |year=2007 |publisher=Oxford |location=United Kingdom |isbn=0-19-856837-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Poison control center]]s and [[Medical toxicology|medical toxicologists]] are available in many areas to provide guidance in overdoses to both physicians and the general public.

===Antidotes===

Specific [[antidote]]s are available for certain overdoses. For example, [[naloxone]] is the antidote for [[opiate]]s such as [[heroin]] or [[morphine]]. Similarly, [[benzodiazepine]] overdoses may be effectively reversed with [[flumazenil]]. As a nonspecific antidote, [[activated charcoal]] is frequently recommended if available within one hour of the ingestion and the ingestion is significant.&lt;ref name=AHAPart12&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vanden Hoek|first=TL |author2=Morrison, LJ |author3=Shuster, M |author4=Donnino, M |author5=Sinz, E |author6=Lavonas, EJ |author7=Jeejeebhoy, FM |author8=Gabrielli, A|title=Part 12: cardiac arrest in special situations: 2010 American Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care|journal=Circulation|date=Nov 2, 2010|volume=122|issue=18 Suppl 3|pages=S829–61|pmid=20956228|doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.971069}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gastric lavage]], [[syrup of ipecac]], and [[whole bowel irrigation]] are rarely used.&lt;ref name=AHAPart12/&gt;

Drug overdose was the leading cause of injury death in 2013. Among people 25 to 64 years old, drug overdose caused more deaths than motor vehicle traffic crashes. There were 43,982 drug overdose deaths in the United States in 2013. Of these, 22,767 (51.8%) were related to prescription drugs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/epidemic/index.html "Understanding the Epidemic | Drug Overdose | CDC Injury Center"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170909011619/https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/epidemic/index.html |date=2017-09-09 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 22,767 deaths relating to prescription drug overdose in 2013, 16,235 (71.3%) involved opioid painkillers, and 6,973 (30.6%) involved [[benzodiazepines]].  Drug misuse and abuse caused about 2.5 million emergency department (ED) visits in 2011. Of these, more than 1.4 million ED visits were related to prescription drugs. Among those ED visits, 501,207 visits were related to anti-anxiety and insomnia medications, and 420,040 visits were related to opioid analgesics.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/data/overdose.html "Prescription Opioid Overdose Data | Drug Overdose | CDC Injury Center"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118060815/https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/data/overdose.html |date=2017-01-18 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''ectotherm''' (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ἐκτός (''ektós'') "outside" and θερμός (''thermós'') "hot"), is an organism in which internal physiological sources of heat are of relatively small or quite negligible importance in controlling [[body temperature]].&lt;ref name=JDav&gt;Davenport, John. Animal Life at Low Temperature.

Savage]]; with photographs by Michael Fogden and Patricia Fogden.|year=2002|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, Ill.|title=The Amphibians and Reptiles of Costa Rica: a Herpetofauna Between Two Continents, Between Two Seas}}&lt;/ref&gt; which permit them to operate at very economical [[metabolic]] rates.&lt;ref name="hilde"&gt;{{cite book|page=429|isbn=0-471-29505-1|author=Milton Hildebrand; G. E. Goslow, Jr. Principal ill. Viola Hildebrand.|year=2001|publisher=Wiley|location=New York|title=Analysis of vertebrate structure}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colloquially, some refer to these organisms as "'''cold blooded'''" though such a term is not technically correct, as the blood temperature of the organism varies with ambient environmental temperature. Some of these animals live in environments where temperatures are practically constant, as is typical of regions of the abyssal ocean and hence can be regarded as [[homeothermic]] ectotherms. In contrast, in places where temperature varies so widely as to limit the physiological activities of other kinds of ectotherms, many species habitually seek out external sources of heat or shelter from heat; for example, many [[reptile]]s regulate their body temperature by [[wikt:bask|basking]] in the sun, or seeking shade when necessary in addition to a whole host of other behavioral thermoregulation mechanisms.
For home captivity as pet, reptile owners can use a UVB/UVA light system to assist the animals' basking behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://buddygenius.com/best-reptile-light-bulbs/|title=Best Reptile UVA/UVB Light Bulbs (Reviewed + Best Deals From Amazon) – BuddyGenius|author=|date=4 January 2018|website=buddygenius.com|accessdate=6 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180117190727/https://buddygenius.com/best-reptile-light-bulbs/|archivedate=17 January 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to ectotherms, [[endothermy|endotherms]] rely largely, even predominantly, on heat from internal [[metabolism|metabolic]] processes, and [[mesotherm]]s use an intermediate strategy.

In ectotherms, fluctuating ambient temperatures may affect the body temperature. Such variation in body temperature is called [[poikilotherm]]y, though the concept is not widely satisfactory and the use of the term is declining. In small aquatic creatures such as [[Rotifer]]a, the poikilothermy is practically absolute, but other creatures (like [[Jonah crab|crabs]]) have wider physiological options at their disposal, and they can move to preferred temperatures, avoid ambient temperature changes, or moderate their effects.&lt;ref name=JDav/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lewis | first1 = L | last2 = Ayers | first2 = J | year = 2014 | title = Temperature Preference and Acclimation in the Jonah Crab, ''Cancer borealis'' | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022098114000483 | journal = Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology | volume = 455 | issue = | pages = 7–13 | doi=10.1016/j.jembe.2014.02.013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ectotherms can also display the features of [[homeothermy]], especially within aquatic organisms.  Normally their range of ambient environmental temperatures is relatively constant, and there are few in number that attempt to maintain a higher internal temperature due to the high associated costs.&lt;ref&gt;Willmer, Pat; Stone, Graham; Johnston, Ian.

==Adaptations==
Various patterns of behavior enable certain ectotherms to regulate body temperature to a useful extent. To warm up, reptiles and many insects find sunny places and adopt positions that maximise their exposure; at harmfully high temperatures they seek shade or cooler water. In cold weather, honey bees huddle together to retain heat. Butterflies and moths may orient their wings to maximize exposure to solar radiation in order to build up heat before take-off.&lt;ref name=JDav/&gt; Gregarious caterpillars, such as the [[Forest Tent Caterpillar Moth|Forest Tent caterpillar]] and [[fall webworm]], benefit from basking in large groups for thermoregulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McClure|first=Melanie|author2=Cannel, Elizabeth |author3=Despland, Emma |title=Thermal ecology and behaviour of the nomadic social forager Malacosoma disstria|journal=Physiological Entomology|date=June 2011|volume=36|issue=2|pages=120–127|doi=10.1111/j.1365-3032.2010.00770.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schowalter|first=T.

Such endothermal activity is an example of the difficulty of consistent application of terms such as poikilothermy and homiothermy.&lt;ref name=JDav/&gt;

In addition to behavioral adaptations, physiological adaptations help ectotherms regulate temperature. Diving reptiles conserve heat by [[Heat exchanger#In nature|heat exchange]] mechanisms, whereby cold blood from the skin picks up heat from blood moving outward from the body core, re-using and thereby conserving some of the heat that otherwise would have been wasted. The skin of bullfrogs secretes more mucus when it is hot, allowing more cooling by evaporation.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

During periods of cold, some ectotherms enter a state of [[torpor]], in which their metabolism slows or, in some cases, such as the [[wood frog]], effectively stops. The torpor might last overnight or last for a season, or even for years, depending on the species and circumstances.

==Pros and cons==
[[File:BLACK SNAKE.jpg|thumb|350px|A 1.8m southern black racer basking in the [[Inverness, Florida]] sunshine on a cool morning.]]
Ectotherms rely largely on external heat sources such as [[sunlight]] to achieve their optimal [[body temperature]] for various bodily activities. Accordingly, they depend on ambient conditions to reach operational body temperatures. In contrast, [[endotherm]]ic animals, as a rule, maintain nearly constant high operational body temperatures largely by reliance on internal heat produced by metabolically active organs (liver, kidney, heart, brain, muscle) or even by specialized heat producing organs like [[brown adipose tissue]] (BAT). Also, as a rule, ectotherms have lower metabolic rates than [[endotherms]] at a given body mass. As a consequence, endotherms generally rely on higher food consumption, and commonly on food of higher energy content. Such requirements may limit the [[carrying capacity]] of a given environment for endotherms as compared to its carrying capacity for ectotherms.

Because ectotherms depend on environmental conditions for body temperature regulation, as a rule, they are more sluggish at night and in early mornings. When they emerge from shelter, many [[Diurnality|diurnal]] ectotherms need to heat up in the early sunlight before they can begin their daily activities. In cool weather the foraging activity of such species is therefore restricted to the day time in most vertebrate ectotherms, and in cold climates most cannot survive at all. In lizards, for instance, most [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]] species are geckos specialising in [[Ambush predator|"sit and wait"]] foraging strategies. Such strategies do not require as much energy as active foraging and do not, as a rule, require hunting activity of the same intensity. From another point of view, sit-and-wait predation may require very long periods of unproductive waiting. Endotherms cannot, in general, afford such long periods without food, but suitably adapted ectotherms can wait without expending much energy. Endothermic vertebrate species are therefore less dependent on the environmental conditions and have developed a higher variability (both within and between species) in their daily patterns of activity.&lt;ref name=Hut&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Hut RA, Kronfeld-Schor N, van der Vinne V, De la Iglesia H |title=In search of a temporal niche: environmental factors.|journal=Progress in Brain Research|year=2012|volume=199|pages=281–304|pmid=22877672|doi=10.1016/B978-0-444-59427-3.00017-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contrast between thermodynamics and biological terminology==
Possible confusion can arise from the difference in the terminology of physics and biology. Whereas the '''''thermodynamic''''' terms "[[exothermic]]" and "[[endothermic]]" respectively refer to processes that give out heat energy and processes that absorb heat energy, in '''''biology''''' the sense is effectively inverted. The [[Metabolism|metabolic]] term "ectotherm" refers to organisms that rely largely on external heat to achieve a full working temperature, and "endotherm" refers to organisms that produce heat from within as a major factor in controlling their bodily temperature.

'''Edward William Elton''' (August 1794–20 July 1843), was an English actor.

==Biography==
Eltonwas born in London, in the parish of Lambeth, in August 1794, and was trained for the law in the office of a solicitor named Springhall in [[Verulam Buildings]], [[Gray's Inn]]. His father, whose name was Elt, was a schoolmaster in the neighbourhood of [[Tottenham Court Road]], and got up plays among his scholars. In these, at the [[Sans Souci Theatre]] in [[Leicester Place]], and subsequently at Pym's private theatre, [[Wilson Street]], [[Gray's Inn Lane]], Elton acted, as a youth.{{sfn|Knight|1889|p=338}}

After joining a strolling company, he appeared, in 1823, as utility actor at the Olympic, playing in ''A Fish out of Water,'' where he made the acquaintance of [[Tyrone Power (1795–1841)|Tyrone Power]]. At Christmas he went to the Liverpool Amphitheatre, where the following year, after a summer engagement at Birmingham, under [[Alfred Bunn]], he played Napoleon in the spectacle of the ''Battle of Waterloo''. He then, at the [[Theatre Royal, Liverpool]], played Cominius in ''[[Coriolanus]]''. After starring in Chester, Worcester, Shrewsbury, and elsewhere, he attracted in Manchester the favourable notice of [[Charles Mayne Young|Charles Young]], with whom he appeared in Norwich and Cambridge.{{sfn|Knight|1889|p=338}}

His efforts in [[Shakespeare]]an parts were not very successful. With a fair country reputation, however, he came in 1831 to the [[Garrick Theatre]] in Whitechapel, opening under Conquest and Wynn in ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]''. Great popularity attended him at the [[East End]].{{sfn|Knight|1889|p=338}}

In October 1832 he was at the [[Royal Strand Theatre|Strand Theatre]], whence he went to the Surrey. An unsuccessful engagement at the [[Haymarket Theatre|Haymarket]], under Morris, in 1833 came to a speedy termination. He then returned to the minor theatres, was in the spring of 1836 at the [[Adelphi Theatre|Adelphi]], and 10 January 1837 at [[Covent Garden]], under Osbaldiston's management, made a success as the [[eponym]]ous ''[[Walter Tirel|Walter Tyrrell]]''.{{sfn|Knight|1889|p=339}}

On the production, 26 June 1837, at the Haymarket of ''[[The Bridal]]'' adapted by [[Sheridan Knowles]] from the ''[[Maid's Tragedy]]'' of Beaumont and Fletcher, he gained much credit as Amintor. He was then engaged for Covent Garden, at which house he was the original Beauséant in ''[[The Lady of Lyons]]''. At [[Drury Lane]], 1839–40, he played Romeo and Rolls, and was the original Rizzio in Haynes's ''Mary Stuart''. He then retired to the minor theatres, and in 1841-2 returned with Macready to Drury Lane. The theatre closed 14 June 1843. Before the termination of the season he accepted an engagement of a month from [[William Henry Murray|William H. Murray]] of the [[Theatre Royal, Edinburgh]].{{sfn|Knight|1889|p=339}}

In addition to the characters mentioned above, Elton was good as Edgar in ''[[King Lear (play)|King Lear]]''. He was the original [[Eugene Aram]], Thierry, and Waller in the ''[[Love Chase]]'' of [[Sheridan Knowles]].{{sfn|Knight|1889|p=339}}

Elton contributed to periodical literature, and gave lectures on drama at the [[National Hall, Holborn]]. He was one of the original promoters of the [[General Theatrical Fund Association]].{{sfn|Knight|1889|p=339}}

In 1843, at the end of his months engagement in Edinburgh, he boarded the ''Pegasus'' for London and was drowned when the ship struck rocks near [[Lindisfarne|Holy Island]] and went down. A strong sensation was caused by his death, and benefits for his children, to which liberal subscriptions were sent, took place at many theatres. The chair at a preliminary meeting in London for the purpose was taken by [[Charles Dickens]].{{sfn|Knight|1889|p=339}}

==Family==
Elton was unfortunate in marriage, having been separated from his first wife, and the second wife, a [[Miss Pratt]], the mother of five of his seven children, going mad.{{sfn|Knight|1889|p=339}}

'''''Evolution: The Game of Intelligent Life''''', also known as ''Genetic Evolution: The Race for Intelligent Life'' in [[Germany]] and ''Evolução: O Jogo da Vida'' in [[Brazil]], is a [[life simulation game|life simulation]] &amp; [[real-time strategy]] [[computer game]] that allows players to experience, guide, and control [[evolution]] from an [[isometric projection|isometric]] view on either historical earth or on randomly generated worlds while racing against computer opponents to reach the top of the evolution chain, and gradually evolving the player's animals to reach the "grand goal of intelligent life".

==Gameplay==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}

Players select different ages to play through, including the [[Labyrinthodontia]], or the [[Temnospondyli|first amphibians]] through to the evolution of the Age of [[Mammals]]. Each species has points that players can spend on adapting or evolving their creature populations, which are represented by animated icons of that creature. The more points a player spends on a field for a species, the quicker it evolves, becomes better at feeding (and growing in number faster), or better at fighting off predators. When a player evolves a creature, one can pick a population to be upgraded to the evolution one chooses. Each creature has a different set of evolution paths, and some can evolve into six or more different creatures. The world grows as the game advances, with land masses drifting and terrain shifting. As the player evolves the selected creatures, the player slowly advances in the complexity of the animals, eventually reaching intelligent life. Usually, the first player to do this is the victor (standard rules).

The game starts from basal [[tetrapods]], the very first land dwellers: amphibians.  At the gain of the game, each player starts with one population of a species of prehistoric amphibian—e.g. ''[[Ichthyostega]]'', ''[[Tulerpeton]]'', and ''[[Acanthostega]]''.  Gradually, if the player monitors the species' progress and moves them to more appropriate habitats and climate zones, the selected species will feed, breed, and prosper. From that secure population who can then evolve more advanced and adaptable creatures, along with continental drift and climate change, the other, older, and more primitive species will be rendered obsolete, and their creatures will die out.

As the player advances their creatures, extinctions may wipe out populations of some species, while others may not be affected at all.  Each species has a drop-down menu, which displays all the more advanced creatures that this particular species can evolve into. Eventually, when the player reaches intelligent and advanced animals, the menu will display certain creatures that can then evolve into the standard intelligent life of civilization builders.  The line of intelligent species doesn't have to be humans (e.g. ''[[Australopithecus]]'', ''[[Homo habilis]]'', ''[[Homo sapiens]]''). The player can also evolve other intelligent species who are fictional or highly speculative.  For example, if a player evolves one of the creatures into an elephant, one can access the elephant line, and gradually evolve that [[elephant]] into ''Elephantosapiens'' which is a species of intelligent life, thus winning the game.  ''Elephantosapiens'' of course, is fictional and speculative.  Other species of intelligent life within the game are [[parrot]] men, [[wombat]] men, and [[dinosaur|dino]] men.

Once a player evolves intelligent life, the game ends and scores are added up and displayed, although the player who evolved intelligent life is guaranteed victory.  Score points are given to players who make evolutionary breakthroughs.  For example, evolving the first [[reptile]], [[mammal]], or [[dinosaur]] is worth bonus points.

The game can either be played alone or against the computer.  With opponents, the game has another side to it.  Each animal has the ability to evolve defense, and other animals ([[predatory]] creatures) controlled by the players, can fight one another's creatures, thus wiping out an enemy population, reducing competition and weakening the opponent. To fend off these attacks, the other player can, as said earlier, evolve defenses against the opponent's predators.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1482">'''Fang Junying''' (1884-1923), was a Chinese revolutionary. 

She was the niece of the progressive reformer [[Fang Jiashi]], a follower of [[Weng Tonghe]], and sister of the revolutionaries [[Fang Shengdong]] and [[Fang Shengtao]]. In 1901-1911, she studied in [[Japan]], and became involved with the revolutionary republican movements among the Chinese students there.  She became a member of the [[Tonghmenghui]] in 1905, and head of its assassination section in 1907. In 1908, she participated in a planned assassination of Prince regent [[Zai Feng]]. She was one of the ideologists who planned the [[Guangzhou Uprising]] 27 April 1911. 

In 1912-1922, she studied in [[France]]. Upon her return to China, she committed suicide through an overdose of [[morphine]]. She stated her reason as her sorrow over the rampant corruption in China.

'''''Finding Dawn''''' is a 2006 [[documentary film]] by [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis]] filmmaker [[Christine Welsh]] looking into the fate of an estimated 500 [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Canadian Aboriginal]] women who have been [[Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women|murdered or have gone missing]] over the past 30 years.&lt;ref name="CSWS"/&gt;

The film begins with the story of Dawn Crey: one of 60 women, a third of them Aboriginal, who have disappeared from [[Vancouver]]'s [[Downtown Eastside]] over a 20-year period. Crey's remains were among those found on the property of British Columbia serial killer [[Robert Pickton]].&lt;ref name="Herizons"&gt;{{cite journal|last=O'CONNOR |first=JENNIFER|date=Winter 2009 |title=FINDING DAWN|journal=Herizons|publisher=Bnet|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_7554/is_200901/ai_n32313401/?tag=content;col1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Georgia Straight"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.straight.com/article/metis-filmmaker-christine-welsh-can-be-proud-of-her-showing-at-the-amnesty-international-film-festival|title=Métis filmmaker Christine Welsh can be proud of her showing at the Amnesty International Film Festival|date=November 9, 2006|work=[[Georgia Straight]]|accessdate=26 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, not enough of Dawn's DNA was found to list her as one of the murder victims at the trial. The film introduces viewers to Dawn sister and brother, and their involvement in the annual [[Women’s Memorial March]] in Vancouver.&lt;ref name="CM"&gt;{{cite journal|last=de Vos|first=Gail |date=January 11, 2008 |title=FINDING DAWN|journal=Canadian Materials|publisher=Manitoba Library Association|volume= XIV |issue= 10|url=http://www.umanitoba.ca/outreach/cm/vol14/no10/findingdawn.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film then focuses on BC's Highway 16, known as the [[Highway of Tears murders|Highway of Tears]], which runs between [[Prince Rupert, British Columbia]] and [[Prince George, British Columbia]], looking at the fate of Ramona Wilson.&lt;ref name="CM"/&gt; Wilson was one of nine women&amp;nbsp;– all but one of them Native&amp;nbsp;– who have gone missing or been murdered on that stretch of road since the 1990s.

Welsh also filmed in [[Saskatoon]], where a woman named Daleen Kay Bosse disappeared in 2004. She went missing in May but a criminal investigation didn't begin until the following January.&lt;ref name="Herizons"/&gt; In the film, Daleen’s parents and friends talk about their difficulty in getting Saskatoon police to take Daleen’s disappearance seriously.&lt;ref name="CM"/&gt;

Native rights activists [[Janice Acoose]] and [[Fay Blaney]] are interviewed in the film.&lt;ref name="Herizons"/&gt;

Christine Welsh has produced, written and directed films for more than 30 years. She is an associate professor at the [[University of Victoria]], where she teaches courses in indigenous women’s studies and [[indigenous cinema]].&lt;ref name="CSWS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csws.uoregon.edu/?p=1097 |title=Acclaimed Feminist Filmmaker To Screen "Finding Dawn" |last= |first= |date= |publisher=[[University of Oregon]] |work=[[Center for the Study of Women in Society]] |accessdate=26 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090508140428/http://csws.uoregon.edu/?p=1097 |archivedate=8 May 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Foxhunter''' (1940–1959) was a champion [[show jumping]] [[horse]] ridden by [[Harry Llewellyn]], best known for their part in securing [[Great Britain at the 1952 Summer Olympics|Great Britain's only gold medal]] at the [[1952 Summer Olympics]] (in the [[Equestrian at the 1952 Summer Olympics|Team Jumping]] equestrian event).&lt;ref name="independent"&gt;{{cite news |first=Genevieve |last=Murphy |title=Sir Harry Llewellyn Bt |format=obituary |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-sir-harry-llewellyn-bt-1126621.html |work=[[The Independent]] |date=1999-11-17 |accessdate=2008-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They also were part of the British [[Show Jumping]] Team at the [[1948 Summer Olympics]], [[Equestrian at the 1948 Summer Olympics|winning the bronze medal]], and at many other international events.&lt;ref name="independent" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3274">The '''Grand Duchess Charlotte Maternity Hospital''' ({{lang-fr|Maternité Grande-Duchesse Charlotte}}) is a [[maternity hospital]], part of the [[Centre Hospitalier de Luxembourg]] in [[Luxembourg]]. The hospital is named after [[Charlotte, Grand Duchess of Luxembourg]], who reigned from 1919 to 1964.

==History==
In 1936 the development of a maternity hospital in Luxembourg went under the leadership of the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]] director Dr. M. Bohler and the school of the state of [[Pfaffenthal]], under the control of the state, with the first director Dr. Richard.&lt;ref name="cp"&gt;[http://www.chl.lu/maternite/la_maternite_en_bref/historique A propos de la maternité (French)]&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]] the hospital was under control of the state, under the direction of Dr. M. Reile.&lt;ref name="cp" /&gt;

In 1951 the first [[Neonatal intensive-care unit|incubator]] was introduced at the hospital. Between 1952 and 1966 the unit of medical gymnastics for childbirth and the gynecology department were opened.&lt;ref name="cp" /&gt;

On December 10, 1975, together with the Pediatric Clinic and the [[Municipal Hospital (Luxembourg)|Municipal Hospital]] the [[Centre Hospitalier de Luxembourg]] was formed.&lt;ref name="cp" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lgx"&gt;[http://www.legilux.public.lu/leg/a/archives/1975/0083/a083.pdf#page=8 ''Law of 10 December 1975 establishing a public institution called the Centre Hospitalier de Luxembourg, grouping Grand Duchess Charlotte Maternity Hospital, Pediatric Clinic Foundation Grand Duke Jean and Grand Duchess Josephine-Charlotte and the City Hospital'' (French)]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Hell's Doorway''''' is an adventure novel by Australian author [[F. J. Thwaites]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article104209459 |title=His Second Book|newspaper=[[The Land (newspaper)|The Land]] |location=Sydney |date=5 August 1932 |accessdate=29 October 2014 |page=24 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Vallance Hunter is a Sydney medical student whose mother is dying of cancer. Vallance euthanizes her and is sent to prison. After two years, he escapes from [[Goulburn Gaol]] and goes to live on a cattle station in the [[Wolgan Valley]] run by a grazier and his daughter. He falls in love with the daughter and goes blind.

==Background==
Sales of the novel boomed after it was read out on [[2UE]] radio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Ron|last=Blaber|title=Thwaites, Frederick Joseph (1908–1979)|website=[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]]|publisher=National Centre of Biography, [[Australian National University]]| url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/thwaites-frederick-joseph-8810/text15453|accessdate=29 October 2014}} Published in hard copy 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; It sold over 27,000 copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article140485179 |title=Australian Novelist|newspaper=[[Camden News]] |location=NSW |date=15 February 1934 |accessdate=29 October 2014 |page=8 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The book critic in the ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'' said that "Mr Thwaites writes vigorously and extracts the last ounce of excitement from the sensational elements of his plot. His characters, however, appear to be somewhat unreal, probably because Mr Thwaites has not mastered the art of writing good dialogue, and because he is regrettably prone to sentimentality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article16899279 |title=Lady Longford Makes More Conversation|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=26 August 1932 |accessdate=30 October 2014 |page=4 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Interleukin 8 receptor, beta'''  is a [[chemokine receptor]]. '''''IL8RB''''' is also known as '''''CXCR2''''', and CXCR2 is now the [[IUPHAR]] Committee on Receptor Nomenclature and Drug classification-recommended name.&lt;ref name="pmid1427896"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Morris SW, Nelson N, Valentine MB, Shapiro DN, Look AT, Kozlosky CJ, Beckmann MP, Cerretti DP | title = Assignment of the genes encoding human interleukin-8 receptor types 1 and 2 and an interleukin-8 receptor pseudogene to chromosome 2q35 | journal = Genomics | volume = 14 | issue = 3 | pages = 685–91 | date = Nov 1992 | pmid = 1427896 | doi = 10.1016/S0888-7543(05)80169-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Function ==

The [[protein]] encoded by this gene is a member of the [[G-protein-coupled receptor]] family. This protein is a receptor for [[interleukin 8]] (IL8). It binds to IL8 with high affinity, and transduces the signal through a G-protein-activated second messenger system (G&lt;sub&gt;i/o&lt;/sub&gt;-coupled&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Entry in: gpDB, database of GPCRs, G-proteins, Effectors and their interactions|url=http://bioinformatics.biol.uoa.gr/gpDB/gpcrview.jsp?id=630|accessdate=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;). This receptor also binds to chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 ([[CXCL1]]/MGSA), a protein with melanoma growth stimulating activity, and has been shown to be a major component required for serum-dependent melanoma cell growth. In addition, it binds ligands [[CXCL2]], [[CXCL3]], and [[CXCL5]].

The [[angiogenic]] effects of IL8 in intestinal microvascular [[endothelial cell]]s are found to be mediated by this receptor. [[Knockout mice|Knockout]] studies in mice suggested that this receptor controls the positioning of [[oligodendrocyte]] precursors in developing spinal cord by arresting their migration. This gene, ''IL8RA'', a gene encoding another high affinity IL8 receptor, and ''IL8RBP'', a [[pseudogene]] of ''IL8RB'', form a gene cluster in a region mapped to chromosome 2q33-q36.&lt;ref name="entrez"&gt;{{cite web | title = Entrez Gene: IL8RB interleukin 8 receptor, beta| url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&amp;Cmd=ShowDetailView&amp;TermToSearch=3579| accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mutations in [[CXCR2]] cause {{SWL|type=mutation_results_in|target=Hematologic disease|label=hematological traits}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Auer PL, Teumer A, Schick U, O'Shaughnessy A, Lo KS, Chami N, Carlson C, de Denus S, Dubé MP, Haessler J, Jackson RD, Kooperberg C, Perreault LP, Nauck M, Peters U, Rioux JD, Schmidt F, Turcot V, Völker U, Völzke H, Greinacher A, Hsu L, Tardif JC, Diaz GA, Reiner AP, Lettre G | title = Rare and low-frequency coding variants in CXCR2 and other genes are associated with hematological traits | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 46 | issue = 6 | pages = 629–34 | date = Jun 2014 | pmid = 24777453 | pmc = 4050975 | doi = 10.1038/ng.2962 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Senescence ==

Knock-down studies involving the chemokine receptor CXCR2 alleviates both replicative and oncogene-induced [[senescence]] (OIS) and diminishes the DNA-damage response. Also, [[ectopic expression]] of ''CXCR2'' results in premature senescence via a [[p53]]-dependent mechanism.&lt;ref name="pmid18555777"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Acosta JC, O'Loghlen A, Banito A, Guijarro MV, Augert A, Raguz S, Fumagalli M, Da Costa M, Brown C, Popov N, Takatsu Y, Melamed J, d'Adda di Fagagna F, Bernard D, Hernando E, Gil J | title = Chemokine signaling via the CXCR2 receptor reinforces senescence | journal = Cell | volume = 133 | issue = 6 | pages = 1006–18 | date = Jun 2008 | pmid = 18555777 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2008.03.038 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jamisha Monique Gilbert''' (March 29, 1995 - December 4, 2013) was an American [[YouTube]] personality and aspiring [[lawyer]] who mysteriously died on December 4, 2013 after smoking marijuana.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newsadvance.com/news/local/jamisha-gilbert-s-death-explained-but-questions-remain/article_d9b08bdc-cbbb-11e3-a07d-0017a43b2370.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.whsv.com/home/headlines/Investigators-Jamisha-Gilbert-Died-of-Hypothermia-No-Charges-Will-Be-Filed-256605501.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Jamisha graduated from [[Heritage High School (Lynchburg, Virginia)|Heritage High School]] in 2013. She had plans to go to [[The University of Maryland]] to study law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wdbj7.com/news/local/jamisha-gilberts-death-is-not-the-first-tragedy-her-family-has-faced/23342476 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305180324/http://www.wdbj7.com/news/local/jamisha-gilberts-death-is-not-the-first-tragedy-her-family-has-faced/23342476 |archivedate=2016-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://wtvr.com/2013/12/05/medical-examiner-positively-ids-body-as-missing-teen/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disappearance and death==
Gilbert was found dead in a briar patch near Megginson Cemetery on December fourth. Crews, who scoured the area for days after she disappeared, used chainsaws to reach her body in the heavily wooded area.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.roanoke.com/news/virginia/jamisha-gilbert-s-death-attributed-to-hypothermia/article_9ae63ab4-cc24-11e3-a141-0017a43b2370.html&lt;/ref&gt; She was naked when discovered, yet there was no evidence of sexual assault.&lt;ref&gt;http://wset.com/archive/local-doctor-weighs-in-on-jamisha-gilberts-toxicology-report&lt;/ref&gt; She had small amounts of marijuana in her system; the drug likely contributed to death, although the degree to which marijuana contributed to death is uncertain. She was covered in scratches, most likely from a car accident which happened moments prior to her death, in which her car crashed into a guardrail at the intersection of Concord Turnpike and Winston Ridge Road.&lt;ref&gt;http://newsone.com/2798515/jamisha-gilbert-missing-virginia/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newsplex.com/home/headlines/Police-Body-Found-in-Lynchburg-is-Jamisha-Gilbert-234612501.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theglobaldispatch.com/jamisha-gilbert-identified-as-virginia-woman-found-dead-police-investigation-ongoing-97055/&lt;/ref&gt; The main cause of death was listed as hypothermia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wdbj7.com/news/local/lynchburg-commonwealths-attorney-to-hold-news-conference-about-jamisha-gilberts-death/25637666 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819113449/http://www.wdbj7.com/news/local/lynchburg-commonwealths-attorney-to-hold-news-conference-about-jamisha-gilberts-death/25637666 |archivedate=2014-08-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Japanese submarine ''I-183''''' (originally '''''I-83''''') was a [[Kaidai type submarine|''Kaidai'' type]] [[cruiser submarine]] of the KD7 [[ship class|sub-class]] built for the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN) during the 1940s. She was sunk with all hands by an American [[submarine]] in mid-1944.

==Design and description==
The submarines of the KD7 sub-class were medium-range attack submarines developed from the preceding KD6 sub-class. They [[Displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{Convert|1833|LT|t|0|disp=flip|sp=us}} surfaced and {{Convert|2602|LT|t|0|disp=flip|sp=us}} submerged. The submarines were {{convert|105.5|m|ftin|sp=us}} long, had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|8.25|m|ftin|sp=us}} and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|4.6|m|ftin|sp=us}}. The boats had a diving depth of {{convert|80|m|ft|abbr=on}} and a complement of 86 officers and crewmen.&lt;ref name=cd3&gt;Carpenter &amp; Polmar, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;

For surface running, the boats were powered by two {{convert|4000|bhp|lk=in|0|adj=on}} [[diesel engine]]s, each driving one [[propeller shaft]]. When submerged each propeller was driven by a {{convert|900|hp|0|adj=on}} [[electric motor]]. They could reach {{convert|23|kn|lk=in}} on the surface and {{convert|8|kn}} underwater. On the surface, the KD7s had a range of {{convert|8000|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|16|kn}}; submerged, they had a range of {{convert|50|nmi|abbr=on}} at {{convert|5|kn}}.&lt;ref name=c5&gt;Chesneau, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt;

The boats were armed with six internal {{convert|53.3|cm|in|1|abbr=on|sp=us}} [[torpedo tube]]s, all in the bow. They carried one reload for each tube; a total of a dozen [[torpedo]]es. They were originally intended to be armed with two twin-gun mounts for the [[Type 96 25 mm AT/AA Gun|{{convert|25|mm|abbr=on|1}} Type 96]] [[anti-aircraft gun]], but a [[Type 3 120 mm 45 caliber naval gun|{{convert|120|mm|in|abbr=on}}]] [[deck gun]] for combat on the surface was substituted for one 25&amp;nbsp;mm mount during construction.&lt;ref name=b4&gt;Bagnasco, pp. 183, 186&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction and career==
Built by the [[Kawasaki Shipbuilding Corporation|Kawasaki Dockyard Co.]] at their [[shipyard]] in [[Kobe]], the boat was [[laid down]] on 26 December 1941&lt;ref name=hk/&gt; as ''I-83'' and renamed ''I-183'' in 1942. She was [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 21 January 1943 and completed on 3 October 1943.&lt;ref name=cd3/&gt; The boat was sunk with the loss of all 92 officers and crewmen aboard by the submarine {{USS|Pogy|SS-266|6}} on 29 April 1944 south of the [[Bungo Strait]] at {{Coord|32|07|N|133|03|W|display=inline,title}}. ''I-183'' was stricken from the [[Navy List]] on 10 August 1944.&lt;ref name=hk&gt;Hackett &amp; Kingsepp&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5328">'''Julaybib'''  ([[Arabic]]: جليبيب) was a martyr and one of the less known companions of Prophet [[Muhammad]] in the early [[Muslim]] community. His name was acquired prior to his acceptance of [[Islam]] and is considered unusual and incomplete. In the [[Arabic language]] ''Julaybib'' means "small grown" being the diminutive form of the word ''jalbab'', indicating that Julaybib was small and short, even dwarf-like. He was also described as being ''damim'', meaning ugly, deformed, or repulsive.

Julaybib's lineage was unknown and there is no record of his parents or what tribe he belonged to. All that was known of him was that he was an [[Arab]] and that he was one of the [[Ansar (Islam)|Ansar]] in [[Medina]].

With Julaybib in mind, Muhammad went to an Ansari man and said: "I want to have your daughter married." "How wonderful and blessed, O Messenger of God and what a delight to the eye (this would be)," he replied. "I do not want her for myself," added Muhammad. "Then for whom, O Messenger of God?" asked the man, obviously disappointed. "For Julaybib," said Muhammad. The Ansari went to consult with his wife, telling her of Muhammad's desire for their daughter to marry Julaybib. His wife was repulsed, and protested saying "To Julaybib! No, never to Julaybib! No, by God, we shall not marry (her) to him."

While the Ansari was preparing to inform Muhammad of what his wife said, the daughter hearing her mother's protestations, asked: "Who has asked you to marry me?"

It is said that she the daughter was so beautiful that there was none among the women of that clan who could compete with her looks. She was so shy and modest that perhaps the sky itself had never seen her head uncovered. She had so much fear of her creator and piety,  that she would spend her days and nights in worship.The daughter asked what was happening, she was told that the Messenger of God wants your hand in marriage for Julaybib. As the Mother continued her crying and wailing the daughter spoke she said,  "O my Mother fear Allah think of what you are saying are you turning away the Messenger of God. 'O my Mother it does not suit a believer to make their own decision once God and his Messenger have decided on a matter. Do you think that the Messenger of God will disgrace us? How blessed is the status of Julaybib, that God and his Messenger are asking for your daughter's hand on his behalf. Don't you know that the angels themselves envy the dust on the feet of one who is a beloved of God and His Messenger. Ask the Messenger to send me Julaybib for there is no greater privilege than for me to be blessed by such a husband, the Messenger of God has arrived with such a wonderful gift yet my Mother you cry and wail."

She was married by Muhammad to Julaybib and they lived together until he was martyred in an expedition.

On the day of the expedition his father in law, had pleaded with him: "'O Julaybib this is just an expedition, it is not a compulsory Jihad, it is a voluntary Jihad, therefore you are newly married spend some time with your wife."

Julaybib,  the one who had spent a lifetime in despair, had now found a loving wife. But he replied to his father in law's request and said,  " 'O my father you say a strange thing,  my Beloved Prophet is in the battlefield facing the enemies of Islam and you want me to sit at home with my wife, nay I will sacrifice my blood and my soul rather than see my Prophet facing hardship while I sit at home in luxury".

Julaybib participated in an expedition with Muhammad in which an encounter with some enemies ensued.

After that battle the Prophet of God, asked his companions to go and to see if anyone was missing from their family's and clans. Each one returned accounting for all his family members. Then the Prophet spoke with tears in his eyes he said "But I have lost my Beloved Julaybib,  go and find him." They found his diminutive body lying next to seven enemies he had slain in the battle.

The Prophet of God asked for a grave to be dug, as the Prophet of God held the body of Julaybib he said. "O' Allah he is from me and I am From Him", he repeated this three times. The companions wept profusely "May our Mothers and Fathers be sacrificed for you O' Julaybib, how great is your status." Thus a companion who had once lived as an outcast, shunned by the society around him. He loved God and his Messenger and reached such a high status. He who was not good looking was blessed with a beautiful wife, he who was poor was blessed by a wealthy wife, he who had no family or status, was blessed by a wife with noble status and lineage he who had lived in loneliness and despair, was loved by Allah and his messenger, He had the Messenger of God say: " O Allah he is from me and I am from him."

It is said: "That upon his martyrdom, that the sky itself was filled with thousands of angels who had come to participate in his funeral."

Julaybib 'The Lonesome one' had become a beloved of Allah, and his prophet, he was lonely no more. Such is the status of the lovers of the Prophet.

As for his wife it is said that there was no widow whose hand was more sought after in marriage than hers.

[[Mom Rajawongse]] '''Kukrit Pramoj''' ({{lang-th|คึกฤทธิ์ ปราโมช}}, {{RTGS|''Khuek-rit Pramot''}}, {{IPA-th|kʰɯ́k.rít prāː.môːt|pron}}; 20 April 1911 – 9 October 1995) was a [[Thailand|Thai]] [[politician]], scholar and [[professor]]. He was Speaker of the [[House of Representatives of Thailand]] 1973-1974. He was the thirteenth [[Prime Minister of Thailand]], serving in office from 1975 to 1976 between [[Seni Pramoj]], his brother's, terms. Being the great-grandson of King [[Rama II of Siam|Rama II]], he was a member of the Thai royal family.
He also portrayed the Prime Minister of the fictional country of "Sarkhan" in the 1963 motion picture ''[[The Ugly American]]'' with [[Marlon Brando]].

==Biography==
He was born on 20 April 1911 at [[Sing Buri Province]] into an cadet branch of [[Chakri Dynasty]] with Chinese ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tour-bangkok-legacies.com/home-of-m-r-kukrit.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The son of Brigadier General Prince Khamrob and his wife Daeng ([[Bunnag]]), his older brother was M.R. [[Seni Pramoj]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thaiwaysmagazine.com/thai_article/2021_kukrit's_home/kukrits's_home.html An Impressive Day at M.R. Kukrit's Home]; [http://www.rootsweb.com/~thawgw/bibliography.html Thailand Bibliography]&lt;/ref&gt; while his great-grandmother, Ampha, was of Chinese descent and was a consort of [[Buddha Loetla Nabhalai|Rama II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Thailand's Turn: Profile of a New Dragon (Thailand's Turn) (Paperback)|author=Elliott Kulick, Dick Wilson|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|pages=84|isbn=0-312-12188-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served as a corporal during the [[Franco-Thai War]] in 1940. Like many upper class Thais of his generation, his parents sent him and his siblings to boarding schools in England including [[Trent College]]. He finished his bachelor's degree in [[Philosophy, Politics, and Economics]] (PPE) from Queen's College, [[University of Oxford]].

Upon returning to Thailand, his first job was in the field of banking; but his true [[vocation]] was his mastery of many forms of arts, including politics and journalism. Put off by Hollywood's portrayal of revered nineteenth-century king, [[Mongkut]], in the 1946 [[Anna and the King of Siam (film)|film ''Anna and the King of Siam'']], based on the semi-[[fiction]]al [[biographical novel]] of [[Anna and the King of Siam (novel)|the same name]], Kukrit and his brother, [[Seni Pramoj]], wrote ''The King of Siam speaks'' in 1948. They sent their manuscript to the American politician and diplomat Abbot Low Moffat&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library.albany.edu/speccoll/findaids/apap063.htm#history |title=Abbot Low Moffat Papers

|accessdate=20 February 2011|quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; who drew on it for his biography entitled ''Mongkut the King of Siam'' ({{ISBN|974-8298-12-4}}), and in 1961, donated the Pramoj manuscript to the Southeast Asian Collection, Asian Division, [[Library of Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/asian/guide/guide-southeast.html |title=Asian Collections |author= |date=15 November 2010 |work=SOUTHEAST ASIA AND THE PACIFIC ISLANDS |publisher=The Library of Congress, Asian Reading Room |accessdate=8 February 2011 |quote=Seni and Kukrit Pramoj, The King of Siam Speaks. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6FAzLJFiw?url=http://www.loc.gov/rr/asian/guide/guide-southeast.html |archivedate=17 March 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote for ''[[Siam Rath]]'' ({{lang-th|สยามรัฐ|italic=yes}} ''Siam Kingdom''), the newspaper that he founded.

As a means of showing how Thai society adjusted to life in modern society, in 1953 Kukrit began a series of stories on the life and times of fictional Mae Ploy ({{lang-th|แม่พลอย}}). who as a young girl enters the service of a princess of [[Rama V]]'s Royal Household, and dies the same day as [[Rama VIII]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cambridgeforecast.wordpress.com/2010/07/ |title="Four Reigns"}}&lt;/ref&gt; This story was to be one of many that were published in the Kukrit's Siam Rat. His satirical sense and unique sense of humour offered an incisive view of the times Kukrit chronicled..  As a scholar, he also wrote many non-fiction works ranging from history and religion to astrology. Most notable are his epics and many short stories portraying various aspects of life and documenting contemporary history. His ''Many Lives'' ({{lang|th|หลายชีวิต}}, ''Lai Chiwit'') was also translated into English. He was a leading authority on traditional Thai culture and had a [[polymath]]ic range of interests from Thailand's classical dance to literature. Most famous for his literary works, he was named a [[National Artist of Thailand]] for literature in 1985, the inaugural year for the honour. And he received The Special Commemorative Prize of [[Fukuoka Asian Culture Prize|The Fukuoka Asian Culture Prizes]] in 1990, the inaugural year for the prizes again. His works encompass many subjects from humour to drama. He was also known as a staunch loyalist and served the monarchy for his entire life. He is considered one of the great statesmen of [[Thailand]].  His former home is now a [[M.R. Kukrit's House|heritage museum]] which is preserved; paying homage to his life and Thai traditions.

He was married  to M.R. [[Pakpring Thongyai]] with whom he had two children,  a son and daughter. He died on 9 October 1995.

=== Acting career === 
When [[George Englund]] decided to use Thailand as the location for the fictional country portrayed in his film ''[[The Ugly American]]'', Kukrit was appointed as cultural advisor to make sure the film accurately portrayed monarchy in a Buddhist country.  Englund had difficulty casting the part of the fictional Prime Minister, but he was so impressed by Kukrit's cultural refinement and mastery of English that he offered him the part, saying, "I can't think of anyone who could play it better."  Kukrit accepted, saying, according to Englund, "We are all actors anyway, and I think you're right that I could play it better than anyone." Probably because of this, after he became a real-life Prime Minister of Thailand in 1975, the word "Sarkhan" has entered the Thai language as a nickname of Thailand itself, often with a slight self-depreciating or mocking tone.

== M.R. Kukrit Heritage Home ==
{{main|M.R. Kukrit's House}} 
The home that M.R. Kukrit built for himself in Bangkok has been registered by the Department of Fine Arts as 'Home of an Important Person'.  It is open to the public on Saturdays, Sundays and official Thai holidays between 10am and 5pm.  Standing in {{convert|2|acre|m2}} of land, surrounded by landscaped gardens, the house is a similar concept to the [[Jim Thompson House]] in Bangkok.  Five small traditional Thai houses were dismantled and reassembled at the present site to make one house.  The house is filled with artefacts and books collected by the owner.  Additions to the original house include air conditioning, a modern bathroom, and a lift was installed when the owner became too frail to climb up and down stairs.  The M.R. Kukrit Heritage Home is situated at 19 Soi Phra Pinit, [[Sathon Road|South Sathorn Road]], [[Sathon]] District, Bangkok 10120.  Tel. +66 (0)2 286 8185.  The nearest [[BTS Skytrain]] station is [[Chong Nonsi BTS Station|Chong Nonsi]].  English speaking guides are available to show visitors around.  Photography is not allowed inside the house.  The entrance fee is Bt50 for adults and Bt20 for children and students.

==Literary Works==

===Literary career===
Kukrit Pramoj is perhaps best known in Thailand for his literary production, particularly his novel ''[[Four Reigns]]'', which was published as a serial in his newspaper ''Siam Rat'' in 1950.  ''Four Reigns'' tells the story of "Mae Ploi," a young girl who grew up in the court of [[King Chulalongkorn]] (Rama V) where she was an attendant to one of the princesses.  Kukrit extends her story after her marriage during the reign of [[Rama VI]], and in the process tells the story of mid-twentieth century Thailand through Mae Ploi's eyes.  The story includes the reigns of four Kings of the [[Chakri Dynasty|Chakri]] dynasty (thus the title "Four Reigns"), and the 1932 Revolution against the absolute monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;see "The Transformation of Values as Seen Through "Si Phaen Din" by Dr. Mattani Mojdara Rutnin, republished in ''Kukrit Pramoj, His Wit and Wisdom'' (1983).&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Four Reigns'' was translated into English by Tulachandra. The Thai version of ''Four Reigns'' continues to be well-known to Thais in the twenty-first century because it has been used in Thai schools, and has been produced as a well-known films.

Only two other of Kukrit's many novels, ''Many Lives'', and ''Red Bamboo'' are translated into English.  In addition, there is a compilation of Kukrit's English language writings and interviews, ''M. R. Kukrit Pramoj, His Wit and Wisdom'', compiled by Vilas Manivat, and edited by Steve Van Beek.  However, Kukrit's writings in the Thai language are voluminous, and include both fiction and non-fiction. Much of Kukrit's writing was first published as either columns or serials in the ''Siam Rat''.  The installments of Four Reigns.  A number of the books serialized and later turned into books.&lt;ref&gt;Van Beek (1983), pp. 20-21.&lt;/ref&gt;  A wide range of subjects were addressed in these books, including contemporary politics, Kukrit's love of dogs, Thai history, Southeast Asian history, elephants, a history of the Jews, and many other subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Van Beek, Steve (1983).  "Kukrit the man: A Brief Account," pp. 11-26, in ''Kukrit Pramoj: His Wit and Wisdom'' by Kukrit Pramoj.  Bangkok: Editions Duang Kamol.&lt;/ref&gt;

:Most Thai were shocked by the portrayal of their revered nineteenth-century king, [[Mongkut]], in the musical [[The King and I]]. The stage and screen versions were based on Margaret Landon's 1944 book entitled [[Anna and the King of Siam (book)|Anna and the King of Siam]]. To correct the record, well-known Thai intellectuals [[Seni Pramoj|Seni]] and Kukrit Pramoj wrote this account in 1948. The Pramoj brothers sent their manuscript to the American politician and diplomat [http://library.albany.edu/speccoll/findaids/apap063.htm#history Abbot Low Moffat (1901-1996)], who drew on it for his biography entitled ''Mongkut the King of Siam'' (1961) {{ISBN|974-8298-12-4}}. Moffat donated the Pramoj manuscript to the United States Library of Congress in 1961.

{{Life in the Universe}}

The speculation of life currently existing on [[Venus]] decreased significantly since the early 1960s, when spacecraft began studying Venus and it became clear that the conditions on Venus are extreme compared to those on Earth.

Venus's location closer to the [[Sun]] than [[Earth]] and the extreme [[greenhouse effect]] raising temperatures on the surface to nearly {{convert|735|K|C}}, and the atmospheric pressure 90 times that of Earth, make water-based [[life]] as we know it unlikely on the surface of the planet. However, a few scientists have speculated that thermoacidophilic  [[extremophile]] [[microorganisms]] might exist in the lower-temperature, acidic upper layers of the Venusian atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn2843-acidic-clouds-of-venus-could-harbour-life.html|title=Acidic clouds of Venus could harbour life|work=New Scientist|first=Stuart|last=Clark|date=26 September 2003|accessdate=30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Redfern, Martin (25 May 2004).

Retrieved 30 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dartnell2015"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Constraints on a potential aerial biosphere on Venus: I.

==Historical views==

Until the mid 20th century, the surface environment of Venus was believed to be similar to Earth, and hence it was widely believed that Venus could harbor life.
In 1870, the British astronomer [[Richard Proctor]] said the existence of life on Venus was impossible near its equator,&lt;ref&gt;Proctor, Richard A., ''Other Worlds Than Ours: The Plurality of Worlds Studied Under the Light of Recent Scientific Researches''. New York : J.A. Hill and Co., 1870. s. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; but possible near its poles.

Since the 1960s, increasingly clear evidence from various space probes showed Venus has an extreme climate, with a [[greenhouse effect]] generating a constant temperature of about 500&amp;nbsp;°C on the surface. The atmosphere contains [[sulfuric acid]] clouds and the atmospheric pressure at the surface is 90 [[Bar (unit)|bar]], almost 100 times that of Earth and similar to that of more than {{convert|1000|m|ft|abbr=on}} deep in Earth's oceans. In such environment, and given the increasingly hostile characteristics of the Venusian weather, the chances of life as we know it are excluded from the surface of Venus.

In September 1967, Carl Sagan and Harold Morowitz published an analysis of the issue of life on Venus to the journal ''Nature''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Life on Venus|journal=Astrobiology|volume=11|issue=9|pages=931|via=Academic OneFile|doi=10.1089/ast.2011.9270|pmid=22059693|bibcode=2011AsBio..11..931M|year=2011|last1=Morowitz|first1=Harold}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Habitability of its atmosphere==
Although there is little possibility of existing life near the surface of Venus, the altitudes about 50&amp;nbsp;km above the surface have a mild temperature, and hence there are still some opinions in favor of such a possibility in the [[atmosphere of Venus]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maik.ru/cgi-perl/search.pl?type=abstract&amp;name=solsys&amp;number=1&amp;year=12&amp;page=41  Venus as a Natural Laboratory for Search of Life in High Temperature Conditions: Events on the Planet on March 1, 1982], L.

In the analysis of mission data from the ''[[Venera program|Venera]]'', [[Pioneer Venus project|Pioneer Venus]] and ''[[Magellan (spacecraft)|Magellan]]'' missions, it was discovered that [[carbonyl sulfide]], [[hydrogen sulfide]] and [[sulfur dioxide]] were present together in the upper atmosphere. ''Venera'' also detected large amounts of toxic [[chlorine]] just below the Venusian cloud cover.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/0201328399/ Venus Revealed: A New Look Below the Clouds of Our Mysterious Twin Planet], David Grinspoon, {{ISBN|978-0-201-32839-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carbonyl sulfide is difficult to produce inorganically,&lt;ref name=Landis2003b&gt;{{cite journal| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807004311/http://gltrs.grc.nasa.gov/reports/2003/TM-2003-212310.pdf| url=http://gltrs.grc.nasa.gov/reports/2003/TM-2003-212310.pdf| archivedate=7 August 2011| title=Astrobiology: the Case for Venus| last=Landis| first=Geoffrey A.| journal=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society| volume=56| issue=7/8| date=2003| pages=250–254| bibcode = 2003JBIS...56..250L }}&lt;/ref&gt; but it can be produced by [[Volcanology of Venus|volcanism]].&lt;ref name="Seinfeld 2006"&gt;{{cite book | last = Seinfeld | first = J. | title = Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics | publisher = J.

==Past habitability potential==
It is plausible that microbial life originated on Venus if liquid water existed on its surface prior to the heating of the planet by the [[runaway greenhouse effect]], but no longer exists.&lt;ref name= "Forbes"&gt;Bruce Dorminey, [https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucedorminey/2016/03/28/venus-likely-had-past-life-next-step-is-finding-it/ "Venus Likely Had Past Life; Next Step Is Finding It"], ''Forbes'', Mar 28, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Assuming [[Origin of water on Earth|the process that delivered water to Earth]] was common to all the planets near the habitable zone, it has been estimated that liquid water could have existed on its surface for up to 600 million years during and shortly after the [[Late Heavy Bombardment]], which could be enough time for simple life to form, but this figure can vary from as little as a few million years to as much as few billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Venus_Express/Was_Venus_once_a_habitable_planet |title=Was Venus once a habitable planet? |date=24 June 2010 |publisher=[[European Space Agency]] |accessdate=22 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.universetoday.com/67240/was-venus-once-a-waterworld/ |title=Was Venus once a waterworld? |date=24 June 2010 |author=Nancy Atkinson |publisher=[[Universe Today]] |accessdate=22 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.space.com/283-venus-alive-signs.html |title=Was Venus Alive?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2656">The '''Lion of Gripsholm Castle''' is a notable example of bad taxidermy, in the museum of [[Gripsholm Castle]], in [[Sweden]].

==History==
In 1731, the Bey of Algiers presented King [[Frederick I of Sweden]] with a lion. It was one of the first lions in Scandinavia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Le lion empaillé de Gripsholm|url=http://www.laboiteverte.fr/le-lion-empaille-de-gripsholm/|work=La Boite Verte|accessdate=9 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When alive, the lion was kept in a cage near [[Junibacken]]. When the lion died, it was stuffed and mounted, but the taxidermist and the museum-keepers would have been unfamiliar with the appearance of live lions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Greatest Castles in Sweden: Uncovering Magical Swedish Castles|url=http://www.exploring-castles.com/castles_in_sweden.html#gripsholm_lion|work=Exploring Castles|accessdate=9 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, from the side, the setting does resemble a heraldic lion rather than a "real" lion.

[[Image:lcvg.jpg|thumb|175px|A man wearing a Liquid Cooling and Ventilation Garment for the [[Space Shuttle]]/[[International Space Station]] [[Extravehicular Mobility Unit]] (EMU)]]

A '''Liquid Cooling Garment''' (LCG) is a [[form-fitting garment]] that is used to remove [[body heat]] from the wearer in environments where [[evaporative cooling]] from [[sweating]] and open-air [[convection cooling]] does not work, or the wearer has a biological problem that hinders self-regulation of body temperature.

A '''Liquid Cooling and Ventilation Garment''' (LCVG) has additional crush-resistant [[ventilation duct]]s, which draw moist air from the wearer's extremities, keeping the wearer dry. In a fully enclosing suit where exhaled breathing air can enter the suit, the exhaled air is moist and can lead to an uncomfortable feeling of dampness or wetness.

While this technology is most commonly associated with [[space suit]]s, it is also used in a wide range of Earth-bound applications where open-air cooling is difficult or impossible to achieve, such as [[fire fighting]], working in a [[steel mill]] and increasingly by surgeons during long or strenuous procedures.

== Technology ==
There are typically two parts to a liquid cooling garment:
* the heat collection garment and tubing
* a heat exchanger for removal of heat from the circulated fluid

=== Garment and tubing ===
The garment is typically a close-fitting non-stretching fabric or a tight-fitting elastic fabric, with flexible tubing sewn onto the fabric. A single layer of fabric may be used, with the tubing either on the inside directly contacting the wearer's skin, or on the outside separated by the fabric. If two layers of fabric are used, stitched channels can be formed which enclose the tubing between the two fabric layers. Where flame resistance is needed, the garment may be constructed out of materials such as [[nomex]].

The tubing is typically a few millimeters in diameter, and may be made out of any number of flexible plastics such as [[polyvinyl chloride]] (PVC) or [[silicone]].  Smaller diameter tubing permits a higher degree of garment flexibility, but at a cost of lower heat absorption capacity, and increased pressure needed to push liquid through the tubing.

When a large area needs to be cooled or the external environment also heats the tubing, a single long tube may not be enough because the liquid becomes saturated with heat and cannot cool any further. Making the liquid much colder is not an option since it leads to uncomfortable coldness where the liquid enters the tubes. Instead, multiple parallel tubes are used to increase the volume of liquid available to absorb heat.

Skin coverage and tubing density can vary depending on the application. The garment may simply be a short-sleeved shirt, or it may be a full-body suit covering the arms and legs. Where the heat removal requirement is low, the tubing may be spaced several centimeters apart across the garment surface. Where there is a very large amount of heat to remove, the tubing can be arranged in a dense grid with no gaps between the tubes.

=== Heat exchanger ===
For portable earthbound applications, the heat exchanger for cooling the liquid can be very low-tech, consisting simply of a container for holding ice, and an electric pump to circulate water from the container through the tubing. The return water is cooled by the melting ice and again pumped through the tubes. Regulation of flow is done by varying pump speed or using an adjustable flow valve. Ice storage can be achieved using a belt-pack, a backpack, or a duffel bag, depending on the length of time needed for the cooling system to operate between refilling the ice storage.

In situations where the wearer must stay in place inside a vehicle, heavy but long-term-operation heat exchangers can be used, such as a refrigeration system to cool the liquid.

When the user's movement is partially hindered through the use of a life-support umbilical, cooling liquid can also be supplied via the umbilical.

== Space applications ==
[[Astronauts]] commonly wear a Liquid Cooling and Ventilation Garment in order to maintain a comfortable [[core temperature|core body temperature]] during [[extra-vehicular activity]] (EVA). The LCVG accomplishes this task by circulating cool water through a network of flexible tubes in direct contact with the astronaut's skin. The water draws heat away from the body, resulting in a lower core temperature. The water then returns to the [[Primary Life Support System]] (PLSS), where it is cooled in a [[heat exchanger]] before being recirculated.

In an independent space suit, the heat is ultimately transferred to a thin sheet of ice (formed by a separate feed water source). Due to the extremely low pressure in space, the heated ice [[Sublimation (chemistry)|sublimates]] directly to water vapor, which is then vented away from the suit.

The ice sublimator consists of sintered nickel plates with microscopic pores which are sized to permit the water to freeze in the plate without damaging it. So when heat needs to be removed, the ice in the pores melts and the water passes through them to form a thin sheet which sublimates (like dry ice). When there is no heat needing to be removed, this water refreezes sealing the plate. The rate of sublimation of the ice is directly proportional to the amount of heat needing to be removed, so the system is self-regulating needing no moving parts. During EVA on the Moon, it had outlet gas temperature of {{cvt|44|F}},&lt;ref&gt;Carson, Maurice A. "Apollo Portable Life Support System Performance Report." Second Conference On Portable Life Systems. 1971, Page 54&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, during the Apollo 12 commander's first EVA (of 3 hrs, 44 minutes), {{cvt|4.75|lb}} of feedwater were sublimated, and this dissipated {{cvt|894.4|Btu/h|W}}.&lt;ref&gt;Carson, Maurice A. "Apollo Portable Life Support System Performance Report." Second Conference On Portable Life Systems. 1971, Page 60&lt;/ref&gt;  The pores eventually get clogged through contamination and the plates need to be replaced.,&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Kenneth S., and Harold J. McMann. [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Qlo_kJwtyZoC&amp;pg=PA120 US spacesuits, page 120 and following]. Springer Science &amp; Business Media, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a dependent space suit (such as the ones used in the [[Gemini program]] or within lunar orbit on the [[Apollo program]]), the heat is carried back to a host spacecraft through an [[Umbilical cable|umbilical]] connection, where it is ultimately radiated or sublimated via the spacecraft's own thermal control system.

Because the [[space environment]] is essentially a [[vacuum]], heat cannot be lost through [[heat convection]], and can only be directly dissipated through [[thermal radiation]], a much slower process. Thus, even though the environment of space can be extremely cold, excessive heat build-up is inevitable. Without an LCVG, there would be no means by which to expel this heat, and it would affect not only EVA performance, but the health of the suit occupant as well. The LCVG used with the [[Apollo/Skylab A7L]] suit could remove heat at a rate of approximately 586 [[watt]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Suárez began his career as a youth player for [[Club Nacional de Football|Nacional]] in 2003. At age 19, he relocated to the Netherlands to play for [[FC Groningen|Groningen]], before transferring to [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] in 2007. He won his first trophy in 2010, the [[2009–10 KNVB Cup|KNVB Cup]], finishing the season as [[Eredivisie#Top scorers|the league's top scorer]] and was named [[Dutch Footballer of the Year]]. A year later, he helped Ajax secure the [[Eredivisie]] title, and scored his [[List of AFC Ajax records and statistics#All-time topscorers|100th Ajax goal]]. In January 2011, Suárez transferred to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], and won the [[2011–12 Football League Cup|League Cup]] in his first full season. In 2014, he was named the [[PFA Players' Player of the Year]] and the [[FWA Footballer of the Year]] as well as winning the Premier League Golden Boot, and sharing the European Golden Shoe with Cristiano Ronaldo before moving to Barcelona in a transfer worth €82.3&amp;nbsp;million (£64.98&amp;nbsp;million), making him [[List of most expensive association football transfers|one of the most expensive players]] in football history.&lt;ref name="Revealed: How much Luis Suarez really cost Barcelona"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jul/11/liverpool-luis-suarez-barcelona-transfer-medical|title=Liverpool confirm Luis Suárez's £75m move to Barcelona pending medical|date=11 July 2014|work=The Guardian|accessdate=24 August 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140711161731/http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jul/11/liverpool-luis-suarez-barcelona-transfer-medical|archivedate=11 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his first season at Barcelona, Suárez starred in an attacking trio alongside Lionel Messi and [[Neymar]], helping the club win a historic second [[Treble (association football)|continental treble]] of [[La Liga]], the [[Copa del Rey]] and the UEFA Champions League. Messi, Suárez, Neymar (dubbed MSN), scored a total of 122 goals that season, the most for an attacking front three in Spanish football history.&lt;ref name="MSN record"/&gt; In his second season at the club, Suárez won his first [[Pichichi Trophy]] as well as his second European Golden Shoe, for which he became the first player since 2009 to win both awards other than Messi or Ronaldo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2016/05/16/luis-suarez-gana-su-segunda-bota-de-oro/ |title= Luis Suárez gana su segunda Bota de Oro|date=16 May 2016 |accessdate=16 May 2016 |publisher=[[CNN]]|language=spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; He ended the season with a total of 40 league goals, 14 of which came in his last five matches, and 16 assists, becoming the first player in history to top La Liga in both goals and assists.&lt;ref name="Goal.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.goal.com/en-ie/news/3908/main/2016/05/14/23520352/luis-suarez-barcas-highest-scoring-uruguayan-tops-goals-and?|title=Luis Suarez: Barca's highest-scoring Uruguayan tops goals AND assist charts|date=14 May 2016|work=Goal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Luis Suarez Player Profile"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.espnfc.us/player/125088/luis-suarez/|title=Luis Suarez Player Profile|date=14 May 2016|work=ESPN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suárez is Uruguay's [[Uruguay national football team#Records|all-time leading goalscorer]]. At the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] he played an important role in Uruguay's fourth-place finish, scoring three goals, as well as controversially blocking a goal-bound extra time header with his hands during the quarter-final against [[Ghana national football team|Ghana]]. At the [[2011 Copa América]], Suárez scored four goals as Uruguay won a record [[Copa América#Results|fifteenth Copa América]], and he was named [[Copa América#Copa América player of the tournament|Player of the Tournament]].&lt;ref name="CopaAmerica"/&gt; At the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] in Brazil, Suárez scored his 40th international goal before he was suspended from the tournament after biting Italy defender [[Giorgio Chiellini]].

Suárez was found by a group of scouts from the Dutch club [[FC Groningen|Groningen]] when they were in Uruguay to scout another player. As they watched, he won and converted a penalty and scored a "wonder goal" against [[Defensor Sporting|Defensor]]. After watching only that match, the scouts approached Suárez and said they wanted to buy him, and after the season, Groningen paid Nacional €800,000 for him.&lt;ref name="Pearce 1-2"/&gt; Suárez was thrilled to go to Europe because his then girlfriend, and now wife, Sofía Balbi, had moved to [[Barcelona]]; they had maintained a long-distance relationship for a year and he wanted to move closer to her.&lt;ref name="ESPNportrait"/&gt;&lt;ref name="personal bio"/&gt;

===Groningen===

====Racial abuse incident====
The season was marked by an incident in which Suárez was found guilty by a three-man panel from [[The Football Association]] (FA) of racially abusing [[Patrice Evra]] during a match against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in October; he was issued an eight-match suspension and a £40,000 fine.&lt;ref name="racialguilt"&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/16186556.stm |title=Liverpool striker Luis Suarez handed eight-match FA ban |work=BBC Sport |date=20 December 2011 |accessdate=20 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suárez disputed this decision.&lt;ref name="Suarez statement"&gt;{{cite news|last=Suárez |first=Luis |url=http://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/latest-news/statement-from-luis-suarez |title=Statement from Luis Suarez |publisher=Liverpool FC Official Website |date=3 January 2012 |accessdate=25 June 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219135306/http://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/latest-news/statement-from-luis-suarez |archivedate=19 February 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a 1–1 draw against Manchester United on 15 October 2011, Suárez was accused of racially abusing Evra,&lt;ref name="FA Evra"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/15324927.stm |title= The FA will look into claims Luis Suárez racially abused Patrice Evra |publisher=BBC Sport|date= 16 October 2011 |accessdate=16 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the FA opened up an investigation into the incident.&lt;ref name="FA Evra"/&gt; Suárez wrote on his [[Twitter]] and Facebook pages that he was upset by the accusation and denied the claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/15328769.stm |title= Liverpool's Luis Suárez 'upset' by Patrice Evra's racism claim |publisher=BBC Sport|date=16 October 2011 |accessdate=16 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 November, the FA announced it would charge Suárez with "abusive and/or insulting words and/or behaviour contrary to FA rules", including "a reference to the ethnic origin and/or colour and/or race of Patrice Evra".

In their next meeting in February, during the pregame handshakes, Suárez avoided shaking Evra's hand, for which Suárez and Dalglish were later forced to apologise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/17004667 |work=BBC Sport |title= Luis Suarez and Kenny Dalglish apologise after US owners intervene over handshake row |last= Roan |first= Dan |date=12 February 2012 |accessdate= 12 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suárez was also banned for one match for [[Finger (gesture)|making an obscene gesture]] towards [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Luis Suarez admits misconduct charge after gesture|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/16148570 |work=[[BBC Sport]] |accessdate=25 June 2014 |date=28 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Liverpool's manager [[Brendan Rodgers]] defended his player by claiming "it's not his job to own up", while Mansfield manager [[Paul Cox (footballer)|Paul Cox]] said he felt "a little bit gutted" by the "instinctive" handball, but admitted he would have accepted a goal scored like that by one of his players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Luis Suárez: 'It's not his job to own up' says Brendan Rodgers |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/jan/06/liverpool-brendan-rodgers-luis-suarez-mansfield |work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=19 January 2013 |first=Daniel |last=Taylor |date=6 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Second biting incident=====
On 21 April 2013, during a 2–2 draw with [[Chelsea F.C|Chelsea]] in a Premier League match at Anfield, Suárez bit [[Branislav Ivanović]]; this was the second time Suárez had bitten an opponent. It was not noticed by the officials, and Suárez scored an equaliser in injury time.&lt;ref name="BranBite"/&gt; The bite prompted [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|UK Prime Minister]] [[David Cameron]] to call on the FA to take a hard line with Suárez: the FA charged him with violent conduct and he was fined an undisclosed sum by his club.&lt;ref name="Cameron"/&gt; Contrary to claims from Suárez, Ivanović did not accept an apology.&lt;ref name="Cameron"&gt;{{cite news |title=David Cameron calls on FA to take hard line with Luis Suárez over bite |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/apr/22/luis-suarez-charged-biting-ivanovic |work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=7 June 2013 |first=Andy |last=Hunter |date=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suárez accepted the violent conduct charge but denied the FA's claim the standard punishment of three matches was clearly insufficient for his offence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hunter |first=Andy |title=Luis Suárez says three-match ban is enough for biting Branislav Ivanovic |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/apr/23/luis-suarez-liverpool-fa-bite |work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=7 June 2013 |date=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A three-man independent panel appointed by the FA decided on a ten-game ban for Suárez, who did not appeal the ban; the panel criticised Suárez for not appreciating "the seriousness" of the incident when he argued against a long ban. The panel also wanted to send a "strong message that such deplorable behaviours do not have a place in football", while noting that "all players in the higher level of the game are seen as role models, have the duty to act professionally and responsibly, and set the highest example of good conduct to the rest of the game – especially to young players".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Luis Suarez: Panel criticises Liverpool striker's reaction |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22311782 |work=[[BBC Sport]] |accessdate=7 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two days later, on 26 June, the [[FIFA Disciplinary Code|FIFA Disciplinary Committee]], banned Suárez for nine international matches, effective immediately, meaning he would take no further part in the World Cup. The ban ruled him out of [[2015 Copa América]] as well.

==Personal life==
Suárez was born in [[Salto, Uruguay]], the fourth of seven boys.&lt;ref name="Lyttleton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pearce 1-1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/liverpool-fc/lfc-player-profiles/luis-suarez/2011/02/09/luis-suarez-s-rise-from-the-streets-of-montevideo-to-liverpool-fc-hero-part-one-100252-28138725/ |title=Luis Suarez's rise from the streets of Montevideo to Liverpool FC hero – part one |first=James |last=Pearce |newspaper=Liverpool Echo |date=9 February 2011 |accessdate=20 August 2011 |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His older brother, [[Paolo Suárez]], is also a professional footballer, currently playing for [[A.D. Isidro Metapán|Isidro Metapán]] in El Salvador.

Suárez moved with his family to [[Montevideo, Uruguay|Montevideo]] when he was seven, and his parents separated when he was nine.&lt;ref name="Pearce 1-1"/&gt; In Montevideo, he developed his football skills on the streets,&lt;ref name="personal bio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pearce 1-1"/&gt; while also taking up work as a street sweeper.&lt;ref name="ESPNportrait"/&gt; The contrast between his life in Europe and the poverty he left behind has been cited as contributing to his periodic aggression on the field, as well as being a possible explanation for the more forgiving attitudes of the Uruguayan public and press towards such cases, compared to Europe.&lt;ref name="ESPNportrait"/&gt;

[[File:Mural escuela 171 01.jpg|thumb|left|Mural of Suárez on his former school in Montevideo, Uruguay]]
Suárez is of [[Multiracial|mixed race]], with public records indicating his having a [[black people|black]] grandfather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/16277126 |title=Liverpool statement on Luis Suarez ban in full |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=20 December 2011 |accessdate=17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The matter of ethnicity was raised in reporting on the [[Luis Suárez#Racial abuse incident|Patrice Evra incident]], where use by his grandmother, Lila Piriz, of "''mi negrito''" as a sobriquet has been offered to explain Suárez's repeated use of "negro" over the two-minute altercation; the FA judged his evidence unreliable ''en route'' to issuing him an eight-match ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sify.com/sports/luis-suarez-s-granny-used-to-call-him-mi-negrito-news-news-mc0skdecaig.html |title=Luis Suarez's granny used to call him 'Mi Negrito' |publisher=Sify.com |date=26 February 2012 |accessdate=17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suárez began dating Sofía Balbi at age 15 in Montevideo; the Balbi family moved to [[Barcelona]] in 2003, and Suárez's focus on football strengthened as a result as he wanted to follow them to Europe to join Sofía again.&lt;ref name="ESPNportrait"/&gt; Suárez married her in 2009, and the couple have a daughter and a son.&lt;ref name="Lyttleton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="daughter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vi.nl/Nieuws-item/184887/Suarez-in-Barcelona-vader-geworden-van-dochter.htm |title=Suarez in Barcelona vader geworden van dochter |publisher=Voetbal International |date=5 August 2010 |accessdate=6 August 2010 |language=Dutch |trans-title=Suarez has a daughter in Barcelona |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100806171323/http://www.vi.nl/Nieuws-item/184887/Suarez-in-Barcelona-vader-geworden-van-dochter.htm |archivedate=6 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has a tattoo of his daughter’s name Delfina on his wrist which he kisses as part of his [[goal celebration]] – this celebration routine is featured in EA Sports’ video game ''[[FIFA 15]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/luis-suarez-reveals-double-meaning-of-trademark-goal-celebration-8457435.html | location=London | work=The Independent | title=Luis Suarez reveals double meaning of trademark goal celebration | date=18 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Watch Samuel Eto'o's old man celebration and more in the FIFA 15 goal celebration tutorial video |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/soccer-dirty-tackle/samuel-eto-o-s-old-man-celebration-and-more-to-be-featured-in-fifa-15-182936039.html |accessdate=14 October 2018 |agency=Yahoo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 July 2014, Suárez joined Barcelona, allowing him to live closer with his wife Sofía's family.

Daughter of King [[Philip III of Spain]] and [[Margaret of Austria (1584-1611)|Margaret of Austria]], prior to her Imperial marriage she was considered a possible wife for [[Charles I of England|Charles, Prince of Wales]]; the event, later known in history as the "[[Spanish Match]]", provoked a domestic and political crisis in the Kingdoms of England and Scotland. In the imperial court in Vienna she continued to be strongly influenced by her native Spanish culture (from clothes to music) and also to promote the strengthening of relations between the Imperial and Spanish branches of the [[House of Habsburg]].

== Life ==
=== Early years ===

Infanta Maria Anna of Spain was born in the Palace of [[El Escorial]], near [[Madrid]], on 18 August 1606 as the fourth child and third (but second surviving) daughter of King [[Philip III of Spain]] and his wife [[Margaret of Austria, Queen of Spain|Margaret of Austria]], Archduchess of the Inner Austrian branch of the House of Habsburg. Of her seven siblings, only four survived infancy: [[Anne of Austria|Anna]] (later wife of King [[Louis XIII of France]]), [[Philip IV of Spain]], [[Infante Carlos of Spain (1607–1632)|Charles]] (who died young in 1632) and [[Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand of Austria|Ferdinand]] (the later known Cardinal-Infante and [[List of governors of the Habsburg Netherlands|Governor of the Spanish Netherlands]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Darryl |last=Lundy |date=5 March 2007 |title=Felipe III von Habsburg, Rey de España |publisher=ThePeerage.Com |url=http://thepeerage.com/p10278.htm#i102774}} cites {{cite book |first=Jirí |last=Louda |first2=Michael |last2=MacLagan |title=Lines of Succession: Heraldry of the Royal Families of Europe |edition= 2nd |location=London, U.K. |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |year=1999 |at=table 49}} {{cite book |first=Marcellus |last=von Redlich|title=Pedigrees of Some of the Emperor Charlemagne's Descendants, volume I |edition= 2nd |location=Baltimore, Maryland, U.S.A. |publisher= Genealogical Publishing Company |year=1999 |at=page 58}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maria Anna's parents had a close kinship: her father was her mother's first cousin once-removed.

From early childhood, Maria Anna has played an important role in the matrimonial projects of her father. In adolescence she was betrothed to Archduke John-Charles, eldest son and heir of [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor]] and his first wife [[Maria Anna of Bavaria (1574–1616)|Maria Anna of Bavaria]]; however, the marriage never took place due to Archduke John-Charles' early death in 1618.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.pe/books?id=7_pmAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA519&amp;lpg=PA519&amp;dq=Prinzessin+Maria+Anna+von+Spanien+mit+Johann+Karl,&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=lhc8QJ2Plk&amp;sig=zPIU9Vp2s9j3d-dVs8CcP9zMWXQ&amp;hl=ru&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi1_8r29PPOAhWEDpoKHdF0Bh8Q6AEIXzAP#v=onepage&amp;q=Prinzessin%20Maria%20Anna%20von%20Spanien%20mit%20Johann%20Karl%2C&amp;f=false Ludwig Albrecht Gebhardi: Genealogische Geschichte der erblichen Reichsstände in Teutschland; Halle: Johann Jacob Gebauer, 1779, vol.

In 1622, King [[James VI and I|James I of England]] received an offer from the Spanish King Philip IV to strengthen the relations of their countries through a dynastic marriage between Charles, Prince of Wales, and Infanta Maria Anna. [[London]] and [[Madrid]] began active negotiations. The possible marriage between the Prince of Wales and the Spanish Infanta, was known in history under the name "[[Spanish Match]]", and caused an internal political crisis in both England and Scotland. In 1623 the Prince of Wales, accompanied by [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham]], visited Madrid to meet his intended bride.&lt;ref&gt;{{BLKO |wstitle=Habsburg, Maria Anna von Spanien |volume=7 |page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Maria Anna did not wish to marry a Protestant and Charles would not convert to Catholicism. At the end, the wedding never took place not only for political reasons but also because of the reluctance of the new Spanish King to conclude a dynastic marriage with the [[House of Stuart]].&lt;ref name="Bastl"&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/11072009/Dos_infantas_espan_olas_en_la_corte_imperial Beatrix Bastl, Jose Luis Colomer: ''Dos infantas españolas en la corte imperial''] [retrieved 01 November 2016].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.pe/books?id=h2v69fUCDxYC&amp;pg=PA73&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Pauline Gregg: ''King Charles I'' - The Spanish Match, pp. 72–89.] [retrieved 01 November 2016].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Braun144"&gt;Braun, Keller, Schnettger 2016, p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hengerer 2012, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; Charles eventually married [[Henrietta Maria of France]].

=== Marriage ===
At the end of 1626 Maria Anna was betrothed to the younger brother of her first fiancé, [[Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand]], new heir of Emperor Ferdinand II. The formal engagement was preceded by a series of negotiations which were conducted in 1625. That same year, Prince Ferdinand was crowned [[King of Hungary]], and in 1627 [[King of Bohemia]]. In the negotiations were included all the life aspects of the Infanta at the court of her future spouse. Despite the desire of the groom that Maria Anna's confessor would be the [[Jesuit]] Ambrosio Penalosa, the appointment eventually went to [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] Diego Quiroga. In the marriage contract signed by both parties in 1628, it was noted that Maria Anna could retain her rights of inheritance over the Spanish throne, while her older sister Infanta Anna, married to King Louis XIII of France in 1615, was forced to renounce to her rights.&lt;ref name="Bastl"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Braun144"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hengerer 2012, p. 57, 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Maria Anna had left Madrid for Vienna in December 1629. The travel took more than a year. En route by sea, in [[Genoa]] complications arose due to an epidemic of the [[Plague (disease)|plague]] that erupted in the [[Italian Peninsula]]. For this reason, the cortege was unable to stop in [[Bologna]], where [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|Cardinal]] [[Antonio Barberini]] (nephew of [[Pope Urban VIII]]), was waiting for the Infanta to give her the [[Golden Rose]]. The cortege moved to [[Naples]], where Maria Anna finally received the award. Leaving the [[Kingdom of Naples]], the Infanta crossed the [[Papal States]], having made a [[pilgrimage]] to the [[Basilica della Santa Casa]]. On this section of her journey Maria Anna was accompanied by Roman aristocracy, led by another nephew of Pope Urban VIII, [[Taddeo Barberini]], [[Palestrina|Prince of Palestrina]]. On 26 January 1631 she arrived in [[Trieste]], where she met [[Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria]], her future brother-in-law, who escort the Infanta to the Vienna court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dspace.unitus.it/bitstream/2067/2542/1/fquatrini_tesid.pdf Francesca Quatrini: ''Eleonora d’Austria, Maria Anna d’Asburgo-Spagna e Maria Ludovica Gonzaga Nevers – tre regine in viaggio nell’Europa moderna. Sigla del settore scientifico-disciplinare''] [retrieved 01 November 2016].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hengerer 2012, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; That day, Maria Anna was married to King Ferdinand of Hungria-Bohemia [[Proxy marriage|''per procura'']] with Archduke Leopold Wilhelm serving as the proxy.

Before the official wedding, King Ferdinand, not trusting the previous portraits that he had seen of the Infanta, decided to secretly watch his bride. The Royal ''oberhofmeister'' asked for an audience with Maria Anna; on this visit, he was accompanied by some nobles, among whom was her groom. Struck by the beauty of the Infanta, King Ferdinand immediately revealed his identity and began a conversation with Maria Anna in Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;Hengerer 2012, pp. 85–86.&lt;/ref&gt; The love and respect that the future emperor felt for his wife lasted through all their marriage. He was never unfaithful to her or had illegitimate children.&lt;ref name="Hengerer130"&gt;Hengerer 2012, pp. 130–131.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Vienna]] on 20 February 1631&lt;ref name="Heydenreich"/&gt; Maria Anna was formally married with King Ferdinand of Hungary-Bohemia, with festivities lasting a month. The marriage was described as friendly. Maria Anna was described as happy-tempered, friendly, and intelligent, and she able to ease the feelings of the melancholic Ferdinand.

===Holy Roman Empress and German Queen ===
With Maria Anna, arrived at the Imperial court in Vienna the Spanish fashion, theater, dance and music (including the first sounded [[guitar]]). As the wife of the heir, she maintained good relations with all the members of her husband's family; however, she had a complicated relationship with Ferdinand's stepmother, Empress [[Eleonora Gonzaga (1598–1655)|Eleonora Gonzaga]], mainly because between both began a competition for influence at the Imperial court. Maria Anna also paid much attention to the arts, especially painting. She collected works of Italian, Spanish and Flemish painters of the late [[Renaissance]] and early [[Baroque]].&lt;ref name="Bastl"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Braun, Keller, Schnettger 2016, pp. 146–148.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Regensburg]] on 22 December 1636 Ferdinand was elected [[King of the Romans]], and a week later he was crowned by the [[Archbishop of Mainz]]. Maria Anna was crowned Queen of Germany one month later, on 21 January 1637. After his father's death on 15 February 1637, Ferdinand became Holy Roman Emperor under the name of Ferdinand III and sovereign King of Hungary and Bohemia. After him, his wife received the titles of Holy Roman Empress and sovereign Queen. Her coronation as Queen of Hungary took place in [[Pressburg]] during the [[Diet of Hungary|Hungarian Diet]] of 1637–1638.&lt;ref&gt;Hengerer 2012, p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.pe/books?id=IacaBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA315&amp;dq=Maria+Anna+of+Spain+1606+-+1646&amp;hl=ru&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj81JC1k_bOAhVCD5oKHWYgDHgQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Maria%20Anna%20of%20Spain%201606%20-%201646&amp;f=false R. Bireley: ''Ferdinand II, Counter-Reformation Emperor, 1578 — 1637''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 2014, p. 302] {{ISBN|978-1-10-706715-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Maria Anna, being active politically as the adviser of her spouse, was an important mediator between the Emperor and their Spanish relatives. Despite the fact that she always defended the interests of her husband, she didn't forget the interests of her brothers King Philip IV and the Cardinal-Infante.&lt;ref&gt;Braun, Keller, Schnettger 2016, p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; In her court, which was consisted mainly of Spaniards, frequent guests were the Spanish ambassador and diplomats. The Emperor, during his absences from the imperial court in Vienna, appointed his wife as [[regent]], for example in 1645 during the [[Thirty Years' War]], when he was in the Kingdom of Bohemia.&lt;ref name="Hengerer130"/&gt;

=== Death ===
In March 1645 Maria Anna and her children left [[Linz]], due to the approach of the Protestant Swedish army, and moved to [[Vienna]]. By April it was ready to cross the [[Danube]] there and threatened to occupy the city.  The Imperial family fled instead temporarily to [[Graz]].&lt;ref&gt;Hengerer 2012, pp. 230–231.&lt;/ref&gt; After returning  to Vienna, they were forced to move again to Linz because of the plague. The Empress' sixth pregnancy became known in January 1646; four months later, on 12 May at Linz Castle, Maria Anna suddenly felt ill with fever and heavy bleeding and died the next morning. Her unborn child, a girl, was taken out alive from her womb. She was named Maria after her mother, but only lived a few hours. On 24 May both mother and daughter in the same coffin were moved to Vienna and buried in the [[Imperial Crypt]], which already contained the coffins with the remains of the two sons of the Empress who died earlier. The funeral cortege was accompanied by the Spanish ambassador and the Empress' maid of honor. Very upset by the death of his wife and child, the Emperor was unable to attend the funeral.&lt;ref&gt;Hengerer 2012, p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Braun, Keller, Schnettger 2016, pp. 141–142.&lt;/ref&gt; However, after returning to Vienna in late August he finally paid his respects to the remains of Maria Anna, and in September he announced the engagement of their eldest daughter Maria Anna with [[Balthasar Charles, Prince of Asturias]]. However, the Prince died the following month shortly after the announcement. It should be noted that the Spaniards courtiers members of the late Empress' household who came with her from Spain, including her confessor and the maids of honor of the late Empress, stayed at the Imperial court in Vienna and lived there for a few more years after her death.&lt;ref&gt;Hengerer 2012, p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Depictions in art ==
[[Claire Jowitt|Jowitt]] views the character of princess Donusa in [[Philip Massinger|Massinger]]'s 1624 play ''[[The Renegado]]'' as an allegory of the Infanta during the failed marriage attempt.&lt;ref&gt;Jowitt, C. (2004); ''Massinger's ''The Renegado'' (1624) and the Spanish marriage'', ''[[Cahiers Elisabethains]]'', 65, p 45–53&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1634, the Spanish poet and playwright [[Pedro Calderón de la Barca]], in honor of the victory of the Spaniards and Austrians over the Swedes in the [[Battle of Nördlingen (1634)|Battle of Nördlingen]], set in Madrid a performance in which Maria Anna with her husband was one of the actors.&lt;ref&gt;Hengerer 2012, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

Save a few portraits of Maria Anna as child, almost all of them are included in the collection of the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] in [[Vienna]].

'''Naomi Michelle Miller''' was a woman who disappeared in 2005, and was found buried underneath the old San Angelo speedway&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ktxs.com/news/missing-womans-remains-found-buried-at-former-san-angelo-speedway-husband-charged-with-murder/384762982|title=Remains of missing woman found buried at old San Angelo Speedway|last=Burch|first=Jamie|date=2017-03-09|work=KTXS|access-date=2017-05-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; on March 8, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://conexionsanangelo.com/police/2574-possible-accomplice-to-naomi-miller-s-murder-arrested|title=Possible accomplice to Naomi Miller's Murder, arrested|last=Garcia|first=Juan|access-date=2017-05-22|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170812072622/http://conexionsanangelo.com/police/2574-possible-accomplice-to-naomi-miller-s-murder-arrested#|archive-date=2017-08-12|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disappearance==
Miller went missing in 2005, but was not reported missing until December 2015. Her relatives have said that she "just took off" after a family fight one night which Tom Green County Sheriff David Jones during a press conference with local media, and also stated that none of her personal or banking records indicated any activity.&lt;ref name=star&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.star-telegram.com/news/state/texas/article137588718.html|title=Missing for 11 years, West Texas woman found buried behind old racetrack|work=star-telegram|access-date=2017-05-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''Nintendogs + Cats'''''|ニンテンドッグス＋キャッツ|Nintendoggusu + Kyattsu}} is a [[real-time game|real-time]] [[pet simulation]] [[video game]] for the [[Nintendo 3DS]].  It is a sequel to the ''[[Nintendogs]]'' games for the [[Nintendo DS]] systems. It was announced alongside the 3DS during [[Nintendo]]'s E3 press conference,&lt;ref name="IGNe3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ds.ign.com/articles/109/1098396p1.html|title=E3 2010: Nintendogs &amp; Cats 3DS|date=2010-06-15|accessdate=2010-06-18|publisher=IGN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwYLge3bQFc&amp;feature=related|title=Nintendo Press Conference 2010 Part 7|date=2010-06-15|accessdate=2010-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.com/whatsnew/detail/MvsPLa99GTbqTKaOvwh93lOJHhSHJ_x2|title=Nintendo Introduces Glasses-Free 3D gaming|date=2010-06-15|accessdate=2010-06-18|publisher=Nintendo}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was a [[launch title]], released February 26, 2011 in Japan, March 25, 2011 in Europe and March 27, 2011 in North America, launched earlier in Australia.&lt;ref name="europelaunch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/#!5755319/the-nintendo-3ds-launch-lineup-for-europe|title=Kotaku - The Gamer's Guide|publisher=Gawker Media|work=Kotaku}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-01-10-nintendo-3ds-japanese-launch-line-up |title=Nintendo 3DS Japanese launch line-up 3DS News - Page 1 |publisher=[[Eurogamer]] |author= Tom Bramwell |date=10 January 2011|accessdate=10 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game is one of the first online-enabled titles that uses the [[Nintendo Network]], and is the first Nintendo-published title to do so, although the Nintendo Network brand itself was not revealed until early 2012. All three editions of the game were re-released as digital [[Nintendo eShop]] downloadables on January 30, 2013 in Japan, December 19, 2013 in Europe, and November 6, 2014 in North America.

== Gameplay ==
The game retains much the same style of [[gameplay]] as the original ''[[Nintendogs]]'', including various breeds of [[dog]]s and [[cat]]s as well as training exercises included in the first game. The tricks, however, have been changed; there is now a tutorial for each trick as the game progresses, and the player is no longer required to say exactly the same name of the trick. In addition to [[touchscreen]] and [[microphone]] input, the game also employs the system's [[camera]] along with [[facial recognition technology]] to interact with the player.&lt;ref name="IGNe3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ndogs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://e3src.nintendo.com/3ds/game/?g=ndogs|title=nintendogs + cats|accessdate=2010-06-18|publisher=Nintendo}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, after a while, the player's pet will recognize them and will likewise greet them. However, if a new player shows up, they may react negatively. If the trainer puts their face close to the camera, then the puppy will come up to the screen and lick them; they will also mimic them if they tilt their head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.destructoid.com/e3-10-tilt-your-head-at-nintendogs-cats-176896.phtml#ext|title=E3 10: Tilt your head at Nintendogs + Cats|last=North|first= Dale|date=June 17, 2010 |publisher= destructoid|accessdate=June 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Competitions are also included, once again with five cups each: Junior, Amateur, Pro, Master and Nintendogs. In addition to Disc Competition and Obedience Trial, a new competition, Lure Coursing, is added to the game. Like the original, Nintendogs + Cats has the ability to "retry" competitions. To do this, you can simply save the game before entering a competition, and if the dog places an undesirable rank, close the game and retry it.

The 3D capabilities of the [[Nintendo 3DS|3DS]] are also utilized.&lt;ref name="IGNe3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ndogs" /&gt; The game also uses augmented reality capabilities to project the player's dog or cat onto one of the "?" AR Games cards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgLS17EoiXc|title=New Nintendogs + Cats Gameplay Footage (including Augmented Reality) for Nintendo 3DS|date=8 February 2011|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this, if one of the Nintendo character cards (i.e. Mario, Link, Samus, Kirby, etc.) is used, the dogs will appear wearing hats, fitting the theme of their respective games (These hats are also in the 3DS built-in app, StreetPass Mii Plaza by unlocking them when a dog or cat hero defeats an enemy depending on the room they are in during the game "Find Mii"). The game uses SpotPass and often a Presidential Victor will appear, which is a President and their dog appearing in the game.

== Versions ==
The game comes in three different versions: ''Nintendogs + Cats: French Bulldog &amp; New Friends'', ''Nintendogs + Cats: Golden Retriever &amp; New Friends'', and ''Nintendogs + Cats: Toy Poodle &amp; New Friends''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ds.ign.com/articles/114/1143872p1.html|title=3DS Post Launch in Japan|date=13 January 2011|work=IGN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each version features a French Bulldog, a Golden Retriever,  and a Toy Poodle, respectively, as well as many other breeds for each game. In Japan, the Golden Retriever version is called ''Shiba Inu &amp; New Friends'' (Like Lab &amp; Friends in the previous generation), a more common breed in Japan; albeit not a cover dog, the Shiba Inu is still present in-game in the International versions.

Each version begins with nine dog breeds, but all twenty seven are unlockable in each game by playing. All the breeds from the original Nintendogs games return as well as eight new breeds which include the [[French Bulldog]], [[Basset Hound]], [[Great Dane]] and [[Pomeranian (dog)|Pomeranian]]. There are three cat varieties that appear in each version of the game, however there are no distinct breeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/news/25343|title=Nintendogs + Cats Breed Lists Revealed - News|work=Nintendo World Report}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
Game designer [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] stated that the idea of dogs and cats getting along came from his own pets. Them getting along made him think of the [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] movie [[The Incredible Journey (film)|''The Incredible Journey'']]. He stated that "Making a game called ''Nintencats'' just didn't seem right for Nintendo", so he brought cats into ''Nintendogs''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/23619/news/nintendogs-cats-inspired-by-disney-film-miyamoto/ |title=3DS News: Nintendogs + Cats inspired by Disney film - Miyamoto - Official Nintendo Magazine |publisher=Official Nintendo Magazine |author=Thomas East |date=10 Feb 2011 |accessdate=2011-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This was a great way for owners to get close to the pets, and experience new dogs as they move on.

{{Original research|date=January 2009}}
A '''no-win situation''', also called a “'''lose-lose situation'''”, is one where a person has choices, but no choice leads to a net gain. For example, if an executioner offers the condemned the choice of death by being hanged, shot, or poisoned, all choices lead to death; the condemned is in a no-win situation. This bleak situation gives the chooser no room: whichever choice is made the person making it will lose their life. Less drastic situations may also be considered no-win situations - if one has a choice for lunch between a [[ham]] [[ham sandwich|sandwich]] and a [[roast beef]] [[roast beef sandwich|sandwich]], but is a [[vegetarian]] or has a [[wheat allergy]], that might also be considered a no-win situation.

==In game theory==
In [[game theory]], a "no-win" situation is one in which no player benefits from any outcome. This may be because of any or all  of the following:
* Unavoidable or unforeseeable circumstances causing the situation to change after decisions have been made. This is common in [[text adventure]]s.
* [[Zugzwang]], as in [[chess]], when any move a player chooses makes him worse off than before.
* A situation in which the player has to accomplish two mutually dependent tasks [[Deadlock|each of which must be completed before the other]] or that are mutually exclusive (a [[Catch-22 (logic)|Catch-22]]).
* Ignorance of other players' actions, meaning the best decision for all differs from that for any one player (as in the [[prisoner's dilemma]]).

==In history==
[[Carl von Clausewitz]]'s advice (never to launch a [[war]] that one has not already won) characterizes war as a no-win situation. A similar example is the [[Pyrrhic victory]], in which a military victory is so costly that the winning side actually ends up worse off than before it started. Looking at the victory as a part of a larger situation, the situation could either be no-win, or more of a win for the other side than the one that won the "victory", or victory at such cost that the gains are outweighed by the cost and are no longer a source of joy.

For example, the "victorious" side may have accomplished their objective, but the objective may have been worthless, or they may lose a strategic advantage in manpower or positioning. (One example is Great Britain in WWII, where Britain was one of the victorious powers, but found itself so exhausted in the process as to no longer be able to maintain its great power status in a world now dominated by the United States and the Soviet Union.) A related concept is sometimes described as winning the battle but losing the war, where a lesser (sub-) objective is won but the true objective beyond it is not well pursued and is lost.

In past [[Europe]], those accused of being [[witches]] were sometimes bound and then thrown or dunked in water to test their innocence. A witch would float (by calling upon the Devil to save her from drowning), and then be executed; but a woman not a witch would drown (proving her innocence but causing her death).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A6358926 BBC - h2g2 - Matthew Hopkins, 'Witchfinder General' of East Anglia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== In video games ==
{{unreferenced|section|date=November 2015}}
'''Unwinnable''' is a state in many [[text adventure]]s, graphical [[adventure game]]s and [[role-playing video game]]s where it is impossible for the player to win the game (either due to a [[Software bug|bug]] or by design), and where the only options are restarting the game, loading a previously saved game, wandering indefinitely, or a [[game over]] (negative game end, such as death). It is also known as a '''dead end''' situation. Usually, this is the result of the player's previous choices, and not due to the game itself lacking a path to victory. For example, in games such as ''[[GoldenEye 007 (1997 video game)|Goldeneye 007]]'', ''[[Perfect Dark]]'', and ''[[TimeSplitters (video game)|TimeSplitters]]'', the level does not end once a player fails an objective short of being killed, but it is impossible to progress to the next level no matter what the player does afterwards. Other games take steps to ''avoid'' unwinnable situations; for example, a game may not allow players to drop items which are necessary to continue.

''Unwinnable'' should not be confused with ''unbeatable'', which is used to describe a character, monster, or puzzle that is too powerful or difficult to be overcome by the player or character at a lower standing, and is normally found in [[role-playing video game]]s. In many cases, "unbeatable" gamestates occur because of [[integer overflow]] or other errors programmers did not take into account, called a [[kill screen]]. In this situation, the game may also crash.

== In other media ==
In the film ''[[WarGames]]'', the supercomputer [[WOPR]] simulates all possible games of [[tic-tac-toe]] as a metaphor for all possible scenarios of a [[nuclear war]], each of them ending in a [[nuclear holocaust]] ([[mutual assured destruction]]). The computer then exclaims, "A strange game; the only winning move is not to play."

In the ''[[Star Trek]]'' canon, the ''[[Kobayashi Maru]]'' simulation is a no-win scenario designed as a character test for command track cadets at [[Starfleet Academy]]. It first appears in the film ''[[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan]]''. In the film, Admiral [[James T. Kirk]] states that he does not believe in the no-win scenario.

In the TV show ''[[Quantico (TV series)|Quantico]]'', the agents are put in a terrorist hijack flight simulation mission that is unbeatable.

The '''noosphere''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|oʊ|.|ə|s|f|ɪər}}; sometimes '''noösphere''') is the sphere of human thought.&lt;ref&gt;Georgy S. Levit: Biogeochemistry, Biosphere, Noosphere: The Growth of the Theoretical System of Vladimir Ivanovich Vernadsky (1863-1945) {{ISBN|3-86135-351-2}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Georgy S. Levit: "[https://web.archive.org/web/20050517081543/http://www2.uni-jena.de/biologie/ehh/personal/glevit/Teilhard.pdf The Biosphere and the Noosphere Theories of V. I. Vernadsky and P. Teilhard de Chardin: A Methodological Essay]. International Archives on the History of Science/Archives Internationales D'Histoire des Sciences", 50 (144), 2000: p. 160–176}&lt;/ref&gt; The word derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] νοῦς ([[nous]] "[[mind]]") and σφαῖρα  (sphaira "[[sphere]]"), in lexical analogy to "[[Atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]]" and "[[biosphere]]".&lt;ref&gt;
"[...]he defined noosphere as the 'thinking envelope of the biosphere' and the 'conscious unity of souls'" David H. Lane, 1996, [https://books.google.com/books?id=QrwityQkdxkC "The phenomenon of Teilhard: prophet for a new age" p. 4]&lt;/ref&gt; It was introduced by [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] in 1922&lt;ref&gt;In 1922, Teilhard wrote in an essay with the title 'Hominization': "And this amounts to imagining, in one way or another, above the animal biosphere a human sphere, a sphere of reflection, of conscious invention, of conscious souls (the noosphere, if you will)" (1966, p. 63) It was a neologism employing the Greek word noos for "mind".  (Teilhard de Chardin, "Hominization" (1923), "[https://books.google.com/books?id=GnwPAQAAIAAJ The Vision of the Past]" pages 71, 230, 261)&lt;/ref&gt; in his ''[[Cosmogenesis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Tambov State Technical University: [http://www.tstu.ru/win/kultur/nauka/vernad/uchver.htm The Prominent Russian Scientist V. I. Vernadsky] (Russian)&lt;/ref&gt; Another possibility is the first use of the term by [[Édouard Le Roy]] (1870–1954), who together with Teilhard was listening to lectures of [[Vladimir Ivanovich Vernadsky]] at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]]. In 1936, Vernadsky accepted the idea of the noosphere in a letter to Boris Leonidovich Lichkov (though he states that the concept derives from Le Roy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ag-evolutionsbiologie.de/app/download/3171558102/levit_olsson_ortho.pdf "Evolution on Rails": Mechanisms and Levels of Orthogenesis by Georgy S. Levit and Lennart Olsson]&lt;/ref&gt; Citing the work of Teilhard's biographer—Rene Cuenot—Sampson and Pitt stated that although the concept was jointly developed by all three men (Vernadsky, LeRoy, and Teilhard), Teilhard believed that he actually invented the word: "I believe, so far as one can ever tell, that the word 'noosphere' was my invention: but it was he [Le Roy] who launched it."&lt;ref&gt;Cuenot, cited in Sampson &amp; Pitt, 1999, p. 4). The biosphere and noosphere reader: Global environment, society and change. New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of concept==
In the theory of [[Vladimir Ivanovich Vernadsky|Vernadsky]], the noosphere is the third in a succession of phases of development of the Earth, after the [[geosphere]] (inanimate matter) and the [[biosphere]] (biological life). Just as the emergence of life fundamentally transformed the geosphere, the emergence of human [[cognition]] fundamentally transforms the biosphere. In contrast to the conceptions of the [[Gaia hypothesis|Gaia theorists]], or the promoters of [[cyberspace]], Vernadsky's noosphere emerges at the point where humankind, through the mastery of nuclear processes, begins to create resources through the [[Nuclear transmutation|transmutation]] of elements. It is also currently being researched as part of the Princeton [[Global Consciousness Project]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://noosphere.princeton.edu/ |title=Global Consciousness Project—consciousness, group consciousness, mind |work=Noosphere.princeton.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Teilhard perceived a directionality in evolution along an axis of increasing ''Complexity/Consciousness''. For Teilhard, the noosphere is the sphere of thought encircling the earth that has emerged through evolution as a consequence of this growth in complexity / consciousness.  The noosphere is therefore as much part of nature as the barysphere, lithosphere, hydrosphere, atmosphere, and biosphere. As a result, Teilhard sees the "social phenomenon [as] the culmination of and not the attenuation of the biological phenomenon."&lt;ref&gt;P Teilhard de Chardin, (1959), ''The Phenomenon of Man'', Collins, St James Palace, London.&lt;/ref&gt; These social phenomena are part of the noosphere and include, for example, legal, educational, religious, research, industrial and technological systems. In this sense, the noosphere emerges through and is constituted by the interaction of human minds. The noosphere thus grows in step with the organization of the human mass in relation to itself as it populates the earth.  Teilhard argued the noosphere evolves towards ever greater personalisation, individuation and unification of its elements.  He saw the Christian notion of love as being the principal driver of [[noogenesis]]. Evolution would culminate in the [[Omega Point]]—an apex of thought/consciousness—which he identified with the eschatological return of Christ.

One of the original aspects of the noosphere concept deals with [[evolution]]. [[Henri Bergson]], with his ''[[Creative Evolution (book)|L'évolution créatrice]]''  (1907), was one of the first to propose evolution is "creative" and cannot necessarily be explained solely by Darwinian [[natural selection]].{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} ''L'évolution créatrice'' is upheld, according to Bergson, by a constant [[Vitalism|vital force]] which animates life and fundamentally connects mind and body, an idea opposing the dualism of [[René Descartes]]. In 1923, [[C. Lloyd Morgan]] took this work further, elaborating on an "[[emergent evolution]]" which could explain increasing [[complexity]] (including the evolution of mind). Morgan found many of the most interesting changes in living things have been largely discontinuous with past evolution. Therefore, these living things did not necessarily evolve through a gradual process of natural selection. Rather, he posited, the process of evolution experiences jumps in complexity (such as the emergence of a self-reflective universe, or noosphere). Finally, the complexification of human cultures, particularly language, facilitated a quickening of evolution in which cultural evolution occurs more rapidly than biological evolution. Recent understanding of human ecosystems and of human impact on the biosphere have led to a link between the notion of [[sustainability]] with the "co-evolution"&lt;ref&gt;Norgaard, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; and harmonization of cultural and biological evolution.

{{Suicide sidebar}}
'''Prisoner suicide''' is [[suicide]] by an inmate in a jail or prison.

==Risk factors==
Signs that a prisoner may be at risk of suicide include giving away valued possessions, speaking as if they are not going to be around much longer even though they are not scheduled for release, withdrawing, becoming acutely intoxicated, having a recent history of severe addiction, being threatened or assaulted by other prisoners, having a history of psychiatric hospitalizations or suicide attempts, talking about death, having recently been arrested for an offense punishable by a long sentence or actually sentenced to a lengthy term, or having impulse-control problems. Prisoners who have recently received bad news from home or are demonstrating an inability to adapt to the institutional environment may also be at higher risk. Objective tests such as the [[Beck Depression Inventory]] are of limited usefulness because a malingerer may fake signs of being suicidal while a prisoner who does not want to be stopped from committing suicide may hide signs of being suicidal. Prisoners with illnesses are at higher risk of suicide, with prisoners with AIDS have a suicide rate between 16 and 36 times higher than that of the general population.&lt;ref&gt;CORREIA, KEVIN M. Suicide Assessment in a Prison Environment A Proposed Protocol. Criminal justice and behavior. (10/2000), 27 (5), p. 581–99.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incidence==
Prisons in the United Kingdom had a sharp rise in suicides between 1972 and 1987, with [[suicide by hanging|hanging]] being the most common [[suicide method]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Prison suicide in England and Wales, 1972–87|author=E Dooley|publisher=The British Journal of Psychiatry|year=1990|url=http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/content/abstract/156/1/40}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study found that 47% of the deaths in Finnish prisons were suicides.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.fsijournal.org/article/S0379-0738%2897%2900119-9/abstract|title=Prison suicide in Finland, 1969–1992|author=M Joukamaa|publisher=Forensic science international|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large percentages of those who commit suicide in prison do so after having recently received mental health services,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Factors related to suicide in New York state prisons|author=BB Way, R Miraglia, DA Sawyer, R Beer|work=International Journal|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0160252705000427}}&lt;/ref&gt; although only one-third of prison suicides are found to have a psychiatric history, as opposed to 80–90 percent of suicides in the general community.&lt;ref name=Liebling/&gt; The suicide rate in U.S. federal prisons is lower than the nationwide average.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bop.gov/inmate_programs/mental.jsp&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pretrial detainee]]s tend to have higher rates of suicide than other inmates, with about a third of all prison suicides occurring within the first week of custody.&lt;ref name=Liebling/&gt; Custodial suicide is the leading cause of death among detainees housed in jails.&lt;ref&gt;O'Leary, William D. Custodial suicide: Evolving liability considerations. Psychiatric quarterly. (1989),  60 (1), p. 31 – 71&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Suicides in prison compared to the general population (Europe, 2011-2015).svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Suicides in prison compared to the general population ([[Member states of the Council of Europe|Council of Europe members]], average 2011–15)&lt;ref name=EDJNet /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
{{legend|#73358d|Suicide rate in the general population, per 100,000 people per year}}
{{legend|#9fcb4c|Suicide rate in prison, per 100,000 inmates per year}}]]
According to data by the [[Council of Europe]], in the [[Balkans]] the suicide rate in prisons is lower than in the rest of Europe: between 2011 and 2015 there were on average 53 cases of suicide each year for every 100,000 prisoners in the Balkans, and 87 in the rest of Europe. This may be explained by the fact that in Balkan countries the [[incarceration rate]] is relatively high – so the prisons are not populated by people that are particularly vulnerable – and the use of [[preventive detention]] is rather low.&lt;ref name=EDJNet&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ferrari |first1=Lorenzo |title=Why are there relatively fewer suicides in prison in the Balkans than elsewhere in Europe? |url=https://www.europeandatajournalism.eu/News/Data-news/Why-are-there-relatively-fewer-suicides-in-prison-in-the-Balkans-than-elsewhere-in-Europe |accessdate=22 August 2018 |work=OBC Transeuropa/EDJNet|date=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suicides occur most commonly in isolation cells. The most common time for suicides to occur is in the early morning hours.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bop.gov/news/PDFs/sum89.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Suicidal inmates are sometimes put on [[suicide watch]]. The suicide rate among prisoners is four times as high as among the general population, but it is unknown whether this is because of the prison environment or because persons with marked suicidal tendencies are more liable to be imprisoned for crime. The apparent motivation for prison suicide appears to be fear of other inmates, of the consequences of one's crime, or imprisonment, and the loss of a significant relationship.&lt;ref name=Liebling&gt;{{cite journal|title=Prison Suicide and Prisoner Coping|author=Alison Liebling|journal=Crime and Justice|volume=26|number=Prisons|year=1999|pages=283–359|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|jstor=1147688}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Liability==
In the United States, liability can arise under {{usc|42|1983}} and the [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] if jail and prison officials demonstrate [[deliberate indifference]] toward a prisoner's suicidal tendencies, as suicidal inmates are regarded as being in need of medical care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Roberts v. City of Troy|vol=773|reporter=F. 2d|opinion=720|court=Court of Appeals, 6th Circuit|year=1985|url=http://www.leagle.com/decision/1988737170MichApp567_1674/ROBERTS%20v.%20CITY%20OF%20TROY}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Greason v. Kemp|vol=891|reporter=F.2d|opinion=829|court=11th Cir.|year=1990|url=http://openjurist.org/891/f2d/829/greason-v-kemp}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Farmer v. Brennan]]'', deliberate indifference was established as a standard between negligence and acting with purpose or intent, thus amounting basically to [[recklessness (law)|recklessness]]. The ''Farmer'' decision has created difficulties for plaintiffs in proving suicide liability as a violation of constitutionally established civil rights.&lt;ref&gt;Hanser, Robert D. Inmate Suicide in Prisons: An Analysis of Legal Liability under 42 USC Section 1983. The Prison journal (Philadelphia, Pa.). (12/2002),  82 (4), p. 459 – 477&lt;/ref&gt; The [[burden of proof (law)|burden of proof]] appears to be higher than in [[malpractice]] cases.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel, Anasseril E. Suicide-Related Litigation in Jails and Prisons: Risk Management Strategies. Journal of correctional health care. (01/2009),  15 (1), p. 19 – 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Case law provides that liability only exists if prison officials had [[subjective knowledge]] of (or at least [[willful blindness]] to) an inmate's serious medical need. I.e., they cannot be held liable if they merely ''should'' have known, but did not actually know.&lt;ref&gt;http://scholar.valpo.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1258&lt;/ref&gt;

Mere negligence is not enough for there to be a constitutional violation. The federal courts seldom allow recovery based on section 1983 absent extreme instances of deliberate indifference to a suicidal prisoner or a clear pattern of general indifference to suicidal inmates. There has to have been a strong likelihood rather than a mere possibility that a suicide would occur. Courts have also found that there is no duty to screen every prisoner for suicide potential, unless it is obvious that an inmate has such tendencies or propensities. Further, even if prison officials are aware of the inmate's suicidal tendencies and he does commit suicide, they are not liable if they took reasonable actions to prevent the suicide. In determining deliberate indifference, the practical limitations on jailers in preventing inmate suicides must be taken into account.

Examples of failures that can give rise to claims related to suicide in correctional settings include inadequate mental health and psychiatric examination,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Comstock v. McCrary|vol=273|reporter=F.3d|opinion=693|court=6th Cir.|year=2001}}; {{cite court|litigants=Steele v. Shah|vol=87|reporter=F.3d|opinion=1266|court=11th Cir.|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; failure to consider obvious and substantial risk factors in assessing potential for suicide,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Williams v. Mehra|vol=186|reporter=F.3d|opinion=686|court=6th Cir.|date=1999)}}&lt;/ref&gt; failure to place an inmate on suicide precautions upon recognizing the obvious and substantial risk, failure to communicate the action taken to other providers&lt;ref&gt;''[[Woodward v. Myres]]'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; or to custody and jail staff, failure to adequately monitor an inmate on suicide watch and maintain an appropriate observation log, discontinuation of suicide watch despite prior knowledge of suicidal behavior of the inmate and potential continued risk, failure to follow policies and procedures related to suicide risk assessment, intervention, and prevention, failure to provide training to correctional staff, abrupt discontinuation of psychotropics in an inmate who is known to have made a serious suicide attempt in the recent past, and grossly inadequate treatment by professional standards or the lack of treatment plans, policies, procedures, or staff, creating a grossly inadequate mental health care system, and repeated examples of delayed or denied medical treatment.

One criticism of the current case law is that prison officials are incentivized to avoid screening inmates for suicidal tendencies, because if the screening is ineffective, or the jail fails to deter the suicidal attempt of a prisoner it knows is suicidal, the governmental entity and the jailer may be at greater risk of being held liable than if they had conducted no screening. Nonetheless, some jails screen anyway, since jail suicides are difficult on staff and on the municipality and often lead to legal action, and because some states mandate screening procedures and impose tort liability for failure to follow them. Elected officials may face political ramifications if they become the scapegoat for a prisoner suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Franks, George J The conundrum of federal jail suicide case law under section 1983 and its double bind for jail administrators.. Law &amp; psychology review. (22 March 1993), 17 p. 117 – 133&lt;/ref&gt;

Another factor that has led to more screening of inmates for suicide is that research has shown that suicide tends to be the result of a plan rather than impulsive, which makes the suicide potentially more foreseeable if proper screening is done.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, April R. Revisiting impulsivity in suicide: Implications for civil liability of third parties. Behavioral sciences &amp; the law. (11/2008),  26 (6), p. 779 – 797.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Religion of Humanity''' (from French ''Religion de l'Humanité'' or ''[[w:fr:église positiviste|église positiviste]]'') is a [[secular religion]] created by [[Auguste Comte]], the founder of [[Positivism|positivist]] philosophy. Adherents of this religion have built chapels of Humanity in [[France]] and [[Brazil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url = http://membres.lycos.fr/clotilde/temple.htm
|title = Où peut-on visiter un temple positiviste ? (Where Are Positivist Shrines to be Seen?)
|accessdate = 2007-10-30
|language = French
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States and Europe, Comte's ideas influenced others, and contributed to the emergence of [[ethical movement|ethical societies]] and "ethical churches", which led to the development of Ethical culture, [[religious humanism|congregational humanist]], and [[secular humanism|secular humanist]] organisations.

==Origins==
Comte developed the ''religion of humanity'' for positivist societies in order to fulfill the cohesive function once held by traditional worship. The religion was developed after Comte's passionate platonic relationship with [[Clotilde de Vaux]], whom he idealised after her death. He became convinced that feminine values embodied the triumph of sentiment and morality. In a future science-based Positivist society there should also be a religion that would have power by virtue of moral force alone.&lt;ref name = "soci"&gt;Rollin Chambliss, ''Social Thought: From Hammurabi to Comte'', Dryden Press, New York, 1954, p.424.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1849, he proposed a [[calendar reform]] called the "[[positivist calendar]]", in which months were named after history's greatest leaders, thinkers, and artists, and arranged in chronological order. Each day was dedicated to a thinker.

==Tenets==
According to Tony Davies, Comte's secular and positive religion was "a complete system of belief and ritual, with liturgy and sacraments, priesthood and pontiff, all organized around the public veneration of Humanity", referred to as the ''Nouveau Grand-Être Suprême'' (New Supreme Great Being). "This was later to be supplemented in a positivist trinity by the ''Grand Fétish'' (the Earth) and the ''Grand Milieu'' (Cosmic Space)".&lt;ref name = "dave"&gt;Davies, Tony. ''Humanism'', The New Critical Idiom. Drakakis, John, series editor. University of Stirling, UK. Routledge, 1997, p.28-29 {{ISBN|0-415-11052-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In ''Système de politique positive'' (1851–1854) Comte stated that the pillars of the religion are: 
*'''altruism''', leading to generosity and selfless dedication to others.
*'''order''': Comte thought that after the [[French Revolution]], society needed restoration of order.
*'''progress''': the consequences of industrial and technical breakthroughs for human societies.

In ''Catéchisme positiviste'' (1851), Comte defined the Church of Humanity's seven [[sacrament]]s:
*'''Introduction'''; (nomination and sponsoring)
*'''Admission'''; (end of education)
*'''Destination'''; (choice of a career)
*'''Marriage''';
*'''Retirement'''; (age 63),
*'''Separation'''; (social extreme unction),

[[File:Templo Positivista em Porto Alegre - Posse de Erlon Jacques de Oliveira 02.JPG|thumb|Erlon Jacques de Oliveira, Temple guardian in Porto Alegre|upright=1.2]]
The Religion of Humanity was described by [[Thomas Huxley]] as "Catholicism minus Christianity".&lt;ref name = "soci"/&gt; In addition to a holy trinity of Humanity, the Earth and Destiny, it had a priesthood. Priests were ''required'' to be married, because of the ennobling influence of womanhood. They would conduct services, including Positivist prayer, which was "a solemn out-pouring, whether in private or in public, of men's nobler feelings, inspiring them with larger and more comprehensive thoughts." The purpose of the religion was to increase altruism, so that believers acted always in the best interests of humanity as a whole. The priests would be international ambassadors of altruism, teaching, arbitrating in industrial and political disputes, and directing public opinion. They should be scholars, physicians, poets and artists. Indeed all the arts, including dancing and singing should be practiced by them, like [[bard]]s in ancient societies.  

This required long training. They began training from the age of twenty-eight, studying in positivist schools. From thirty-five to forty-two a priest served in an apprentice position as teacher and ritualist. Only at the age of forty-two could he become a full priest. They earned no money and could not hold offices outside the priesthood. In this way their influence was purely spiritual and moral. The High Priest of Humanity was to live in Paris, which would replace Rome as the centre of religion.&lt;ref name = "soci"/&gt;

==Influence==
Davies argues that Comte's austere and "slightly dispiriting" philosophy of humanity - viewed as alone in an indifferent universe (which can only be explained by "positive" science) - "was even more influential in Victorian England than the theories of Charles Darwin or Karl Marx".&lt;ref name = "dave"/&gt;

The ''system'' was ultimately unsuccessful but, along with [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', it influenced the proliferation of various [[Secular Humanist]] organizations in the 19th century, especially through the work of secularists such as [[George Holyoake]] and [[Richard Congreve]]. Although Comte's English followers, including [[George Eliot]] and [[Harriet Martineau]], for the most part rejected the full panoply of his system, they liked the idea of a religion of humanity and his injunction to "vivre pour altrui" ("live for others", from which comes the word "[[altruism]]").

Profound criticism came from [[John Stuart Mill]] who advocated Comte but dismissed his Religion of Humanity in a move towards a differentiation between the (good) early Comte, the author of ''[[The Course in Positive Philosophy]]'' and the (problematic) late Comte, who authored the Religion of Humanity.&lt;ref&gt;See the central passage of Mill's ''Auguste Comte and Positivism'': John Stuart Mill on Auguste Comte’s Religion of Humanity ([http://positivists.org/blog/archives/3719])&lt;/ref&gt; While sympathising with the need for a [[secular religion]], and appreciating Comte’s respect for “the Human Race, conceived as a continuous whole, including the past, he present and the future”, Mill thought that the details of Comte’s ritualism were not only illiberal but “could have been written by no man who had ever laughed”.&lt;ref&gt;Mill, in A Ryan, ‘’J S Mill’’ (London 1974) p. 234-5&lt;/ref&gt;
 
=== Religion of Humanity in Brazil===
Comtean Positivism was relatively popular in Brazil. In 1881 Miguel Lemos and [[Raimundo Teixeira Mendes]] organized the "Positivist Church of Brazil." In 1897 the "Temple of Humanity" was created.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=b3BA1k09JHUC&amp;pg=PA184&amp;lpg=PA184&amp;dq=%22religion+of+humanity%22+brazil&amp;source=web&amp;ots=08euTo6046&amp;sig=PmQR3toJCZX2aCaXe8oUv7D5lvs&amp;hl=en Latin American Thought: Philosophical Problems and Arguments By Susana Nuccetelli: Page 184]&lt;/ref&gt; The services at the Temple could go on for up to four hours and that, combined with a certain moral strictness, led to some decline during the Republican period.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SltigewTmMwC&amp;pg=PA113&amp;lpg=PA113&amp;dq=%22temple+of+humanity%22+brazil&amp;source=web&amp;ots=eWbqnsEKzY&amp;sig=H6m000aZeQIU8j6YvezXlN5ejbQ&amp;hl=en#PPA113,M1 The Human Tradition in Modern Brazil By Peter M. Beattie: Pages 112-113]&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless it had appeal with the military class as [[Benjamin Constant (Brazil)|Benjamin Constant]] joined the group before breaking with it because he deemed Mendes and Lemos as too fanatical. [[Cândido Rondon]]'s conversion proved more solid as he remained an orthodox Positivist and a member of the faith long after the church's importance waned.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vDHZJ433ficC&amp;pg=PA83&amp;lpg=PA83&amp;dq=%22positivist+church%22+brazil&amp;source=web&amp;ots=hQ8nhytmgT&amp;sig=v_-4WrrWtbHDmHF1tmoDnd1xNj0&amp;hl=en#PPA84,M1 Stringing Together a Nation: Candido Mariano da Silva Rondon and the... By Todd A. Diacon: pgs 83-84]&lt;/ref&gt; Although declined, the church still survives in Brazil. The national [[flag of Brazil]] bears the "Ordem e Progresso" ("Order and Progress"), inspired by Comte's motto of positivism: "L’amour pour principe et l’ordre pour base; le progrès pour but" ("Love as a principle and order as the basis; progress as the goal").&lt;ref name="historianet"&gt;[http://www.historianet.com.br/conteudo/default.aspx?codigo=934 Bandeiras e significados] Historianet.

== Other examples ==
There are more examples of Religion of Humanity started by positivists, and there are several authors who have given the epithet to the religion they support, whatever the religion. In India [[Baba Faqir Chand]] established [[Manavta Mandir]] (Temple of Humanity) to spread his religion of humanity with scientific attitude as explained by [[David C. Lane]] in a book ''The Unknowing Sage''. Comte influenced the thought of Victorian secularists [[George Holyoake]] (coiner of the term "[[secularism]]") and [[Richard Congreve]].

==Life as an artist==
Cecil was born in [[Abertillery]], and studied at [[Newport College of Art]] (formerly [[University of Wales, Newport]] and now the [[University of South Wales]]) and [[St Martin’s School of Art]].  In 1964 he won the David Murray Landscape Award from the [[Royal Academy]], and started a course at the [[Royal College of Art]], but soon gave it up and took up manual work in mines and building sites.&lt;ref name=bigsky/&gt; At the age of 21, he featured in a [[BBC TV]] documentary, ''The Quiet Rebel'', in which he described his commitment to his art and the pressures on him to get a "real job".&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/feb/25/body-missing-artist-roger-cecil-dementia  Steven Morris, "Body believed to be that of missing artist Roger Cecil found in field", ''The Guardian'', 25 February 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=artinwales&gt;[http://www.artinwales.250x.com/ArtistsCe.htm  Roger Cecil, ''Art in Wales'']. Retrieved 25 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;  He later spent some time teaching in [[Ebbw Vale]].&lt;ref name=bigsky/&gt;

He worked privately in the house in Abertillery in which he had been born and brought up, and was sometimes described as reclusive.&lt;ref name=bigsky&gt;[http://www.bigskyfineart.com/a/cecil-roger/lines  Roger Cecil, ''Big Sky Fine Art'']. Retrieved 25 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt; He was only persuaded by friends to start exhibiting his work in 1987, and was not affiliated to any artistic group or movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://museum.aber.ac.uk/person/813  Roger Cecil, ''Aberystwyth University School of Art'']. Retrieved 25 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;  From the late 1980s, his works were widely exhibited in Wales and elsewhere.&lt;ref name=bigsky/&gt;

He was known for both his figurative and largely abstract paintings, "rich in imagery, poetry and colour, which are drawn from his environment, the industrial valley towns and mountains."&lt;ref name=bigsky/&gt;  His works often incorporate everyday materials such as [[sandpaper]], [[Primer (paint)|primer]], and [[Polyfilla]], as well as conventional paint.  The critic Sarah Bradford wrote of his work in 1999:&lt;ref name="artinwales"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt; "He is very matter-of-fact about procedure and materials. To him painting is a very practical thing. The making is important. He brings the work to life by explaining how he manages to balance method and aesthetics. He tells of the ordinary everyday materials he uses, red oxide, polyfilla, stopping out varnish, grate blacking, and how he builds the work in layers, rubbing and scraping back, burnishing, scratching and scoring to reveal what has gone before. He rarely talks about the pictorial language which has become identifiably his and his alone, the pathways and ladders, the shapes that resemble rows of terraced houses, the scarring of the landscape, the triangle and the cross that is the piece of land at the end of the road where the war memorial stands. This is his private language. He hesitates from imposing his meaning on anyone else, preferring others to come to his work in their own way and on their terms".&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Final years and death==
In later years Cecil suffered from [[dementia]], and before his death had been treated at [[Royal Gwent Hospital]] in [[Newport, Wales|Newport]]. He was reported as missing from the hospital on 21 February 2015, and was last seen in the early hours of 22 February. After a search, his body was found on 24 February in a field near [[Cwmbran]]. [[Gwent Police]] treated the death as unexplained. They referred themselves to the [[Independent Police Complaints Commission]] because a member of the public had spoken to a police officer about Cecil before his body was found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-31618392|title=Body found in search for missing artist Roger Cecil|work=BBC News|accessdate=25 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At his inquest on 2 March 2015, Gwent Police said that they had found Cecil's body in the field after a call from a member of the public. Preliminary investigations indicated that he had died from [[hypothermia]]. The coroner adjourned the inquest for three months, for further investigations to be completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southwalesargus.co.uk/news/11828004.Artist_Roger_Cecil_found_dead_in_Cwmbran__died_of_hypothermia__inquest_hears/?ref=rss|title=Artist Roger Cecil found dead in Cwmbran, died of hypothermia, inquest hears|author=Francesca Gillett|work=South Wales Argus|accessdate=25 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Chile]]an history, '''saber noise''' or '''saber rattling''' ({{lang-es|ruido de sables}}) was an incident that took place on September 3, 1924, when a group of young [[Chilean Armed Forces|military officers]] protested against the political class and the postponement of social measures by rattling the [[scabbard]]s ([[Chape|chapes]]) of their [[saber]]s against the floor.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.cl/books?id=Z4LjAAAAMAAJ|title=Las Fuerzas Armadas de Chile en la vida nacional|last=Roldán|first=Alberto Polloni|date=1972|publisher=Editorial Andrés Bello|isbn=|location=|pages=|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The term is now applied generally to cover any indication of military aggressiveness. In a sense, strategically timed [[military exercise]]s can serve as an explicit form of saber rattling, in that the extent of a country's military muscle is put up on display for other countries (namely, adversaries) to see.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

==Context==
In 1924, Chile was in the throes of an economic and political crisis. The economy, heavily dependent on the export of [[nitrate]]s, was suffering the effects of the discovery of artificial nitrates during [[World War I]]. At the same time, Chile was politically paralyzed by a conflict between President [[Arturo Alessandri]] and the conservatively controlled congress, who refused to discuss any of the drafts that he sent them.

On February 1, 1924, the political parties signed an agreement to change the parliamentary procedures in order to limit the censure votes (a procedure used to force cabinet ministers to resign), to allow the closure of debates by simple majority and in general to eliminate all dilatory tactics, especially those dealing with the national budget. As an additional measure, they agreed to create a parliamentary stipend (30.000 pesos for the senators, 15.000 pesos for the deputies). This program was received with public outcry, mainly because it was the only law that had been produced by the governing coalition while the social measures prepared by President Alessandri had been postponed time and again. In the Army, the news were especially bitter since they had been waiting for a salary increase for a long time. 

===''Saber noise''===
On September 3, 1924, a group of 56 young military officers (mostly lieutenants and sub-lieutenants coming from [[middle class]]es or [[working class]]es), led by Colonel [[Marmaduke Grove]] and Major [[Carlos Ibáñez del Campo]], attended the session where the congressional salary discussion was to take place. They quietly sat in the public tribunes, and waited for the topic to be broached. At that point the president of the chamber, feeling intimidated, demanded that the public be cleared, as the discussion was to be secret. As the officers silently started to leave, they began to rattle the scabbards (chapes) of the sabers they wore as part of their dress uniform against the floor, as a way to indicate their discontent with the political class in general, and in sign of support to Alessandri's social agenda.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Consequences==
{{see|September Junta}}

This event was the culmination of a process that marked the increasing desire by the military corps of a more active participation in Chilean politics. Since the [[1891 Chilean Civil War]], the military had been excluded although they were very dependent from all political groups for their advancement. It is also one of the events that mark the end of the so-called "[[History of Chile during the Parliamentary Era (1891-1925)|Parliamentary Republic]]" (1891-1925), also known as the "pseudo-parliamentary period" because the executive was subject to the legislative but checks and balances of executive over legislative were weakened.

The very next day the same group of young military officers involved led by Colonel [[Marmaduke Grove]] and Major [[Carlos Ibáñez del Campo]], created a "military committee" to defend themselves from possible punishments by the government. On September 5, the "military committee" demanded that President [[Arturo Alessandri]] dismiss three of his ministers, including the minister of War and Navy Gaspar Mora; the enactment of a [[labor law|labor code]], the passage of an [[income tax|income tax law]], and the improvement of the military salaries. 

Faced with almost open military insurrection, Alessandri had no option but to appoint General [[Luis Altamirano]], the Army Inspector General (Chief of the Army), as head of a new cabinet. On September 8, General Altamirano appeared in front of Congress to demand the passage of eight laws, including Alessandri's labor code. Congress dared not to protest, and the laws, which had been languishing for years, were passed in a matter of hours. These included the [[Eight-hour day]], suppression of [[child labour]], clear rules for [[collective bargaining]], legislation on [[occupational safety]], legalization of [[trade union]]s, a law on [[cooperative]]s and the creation of courts of conciliation and labour arbitrage.

At that point Alessandri felt that he had become just a pawn of the military, and, on September 9, he resigned and requested asylum at the US Embassy. Congress refused to accept his resignation, and instead granted him a six-months constitutional leave of absence. He left the country immediately for Italy. General Altamirano assumed power as Vice President, and on the 11th, a [[September Junta|military Junta]] was established to rule the country on the absence of the titular president, Alessandri.

'''Shiva Shambho''', also known as Shiva, Sambhu and José Antonio Ramón Calderón (born August 15, 1956), is a Mexican mystic and writer.

During his youth he engaged in several spiritual practices, which led him to have mystical experiences that culminated with the experience of oneness with the absolute in November 1985. From then on he began to write and teach about spiritual matters.

In the 1990s he published detailed descriptions of the major mystical traditions of the world, the synthesis of which he called Mysticosophy. His aim was to show that all major mystical traditions seek, through various practices, to help a person advance via two major routes: the awakening of spiritual consciousness, and the creation of the body of light.

In 2014 he founded the [[ashram]] known as ''Casa de los Cuatro Rumbos'' (House of the Four Directions), near the city of [[Atlixco]], Puebla, which offers courses and retreats.

He has published over fifty books. Hundreds of his lectures are available for free on YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWL9PH02TZ0-QH1Om81WV-A|title=Shiva Shambho|publisher=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He lives in [[Puebla]], with his wife Ruth and his sons Andrés and Diego.

== Childhood and adolescence: 1956–1977 ==
Jose Antonio Ramon Calderón was born in [[Puebla]], [[Mexico]], on August 15, 1956, to an upper-class family. He was the third of the six children of Casiano Ramón Pérez and María Trinidad Calderon Tell.

During his dissolute adolescence he felt an increasingly growing inner emptiness, which led him on an intense spiritual search and, eventually, to meeting his spiritual teacher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://joseantonioramon.wordpress.com/vida-y-obra/de-los-28-a-los-35-anos-de-edad-el-despertar/|title=De los 28 a los 35 años de edad: el Despertar|work=José Antonio Ramón}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a short period of time he studied Anthropology at the [[Universidad Iberoamericana]], but soon quit to dedicate himself fully to his spiritual practices.

== Discipleship and spiritual awakening: 1977–1985 ==

On July 7, 1977, Shiva enrolled in a course of Tibetan yoga taught by Pedro Espinosa de los Monteros, who became his spiritual teacher.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Ramón, J.A. (1998), ''Con los pies en el sendero del yoga y el misticismo'', p.20&lt;/ref&gt;

The course, called "The Science of MentalPhysics", had been designed, and introduced in America, by [[Edwin Dingle]]. It subjected students to a regimen of breathing exercises, affirmations, and sexual energy transmutation practices.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/sciencemen00ding|title=The science of mentalphysics|work=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After performing these practices for a year and a half, Shiva began experiencing various energy-related manifestations, or [[Kundalini]] syndrome, and some alterations of consciousness, which intensified over time. He described these experiences in a diary, which he published years later as part of an autobiographical book entitled ''Con los pies en el sendero del yoga y el misticismo'' (With my Feet on the Path of Yoga and Mysticism).&lt;ref&gt;Ramón, J.A. (1998), ''Con los pies en el sendero del yoga y el misticismo''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, Shiva began to meditate. He first used a technique to purge the mind, which requires being attentive and passively observant of the flow of thoughts, feelings and emotions that appear in one's stream of consciousness. Doing this ultimately leads to their disappearing, leaving the mind in a clear and quiet state.&lt;ref&gt;Ramón, J.A. (1998), ''Con los pies en el sendero del yoga y el misticismo'', p.26&lt;/ref&gt;

As these experiences intensified, Shiva's interests became almost exclusively spiritual. He abandoned his Anthropology studies, and dedicated himself almost exclusively to spiritual practices, and to reading and reflecting on spiritual matters.&lt;ref&gt;Ramón, J.A. (1998), ''Con los pies en el sendero del yoga y el misticismo'', p.27&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1980, he had his first mystical experience, which he described as a contact with his higher self, and which was accompanied by "a powerful sense of timelessness or eternity."&lt;ref&gt;Ramón, J.A. (1998), ''Con los pies en el sendero del yoga y el misticismo'', p.28&lt;/ref&gt;

Several mystical experiences followed, which revealed to him the "fountain that remains...beyond mutation and change...outside of time and space." &lt;ref&gt;Ramón, J.A. (1998), ''Con los pies en el sendero del yoga y el misticismo'', p.29&lt;/ref&gt;

For months he struggled to remain in a state that he recognized as the one [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]] called "awareness" and which [[George Gurdjieff]] described as "self-remembering". Because of these efforts, in early 1983, Shiva permanently became what he would later describe as an "awakened man," that is, a person who is continually "simultaneously aware of himself and of his surroundings",&lt;ref&gt;Ramón, J.A. (1988), ''El Hombre Despierto'', p.11&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast with the common person or "sleeping man", which according to Shiva lives in a "state of psychic sleep".&lt;ref&gt;Ramón, J.A. (1998), ''Con los pies en el sendero del yoga y el misticismo'', p.39&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 11, 1985 Shiva had his first experience of oneness with the absolute, in which "the whole universe disappeared, and only the infinite and eternal Absolute remained. There was no residue of individuality to realize it".&lt;ref&gt;Ramón, J.A. (1998), ''Con los pies en el sendero del yoga y el misticismo'', p.45&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1986, Shiva has written several books, taught several courses, and spoken in conferences and retreats, to publicize the difference between the "sleeping state" and the "awakened state", and the practices that lead from one to the other. He has also described the path and practices that can lead an awakened person to have superior mystical experiences.

== Teaching ==
'''Misticosophy: synthesis of the world's mystical traditions.'''

His most significant academic work consists of having studied and described the mystical traditions of [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Taoism]], [[Zen]], [[Christianity]], the [[Ancient Egyptian Religion]], [[Judaism]], [[Sufism]] and [[Toltecayotl]], and synthesizing them to show that they all seek to guide humankind on how to advance on two different routes: the awakening of spiritual consciousness and the creation of the body of light. This work was published in a series of books, each of which examines a specific mystical tradition in the light of one of the two routes &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://misticosofia.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/3-grafica-send-trad-medio-dir.pdf |format=PDF |title=Unicidad Con El Absoluto : Iluminacion Espirital |website=Misticosofia.files.wordpress.com |accessdate=2015-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://misticosofia.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/2-grafica-s-t-ote-dir.pdf |format=PDF |title=Unicidad Con El Absoluto : Iluminacion Espirital |website=Misticosofia.files.wordpress.com |accessdate=2015-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Teachings on how to advance on the route of the awakening of spiritual consciousness'''

These teachings address the steps and practices necessary to move from the state of a common person or "sleeping man", to a state of awareness or "awakened man." According to Shiva, the common person lives in a state of "psychic dream", a fact which is easily verifiable by conducting the following experiment:
"Pay attention to yourself and, simultaneously, to the place where you are. That is, ''remember yourself'' (in the sense of being aware of yourself, and not in the sense of thinking of yourself). Be aware of your body (do not think about it). Be mindful of it. Now you are aware of yourself. Stay in that state. Do not forget yourself, and then go on with your daily activities ... [by attempting this] you will discover how difficult it is to stay in that state, as it will not take more than a few minutes to become unaware of yourself and to return to the state of psychic dream".&lt;ref&gt;Ramón, J.A. (1998), ''El hombre despierto'', p.13&lt;/ref&gt;

Through various meditation exercises, the practitioner achieves ever longer periods of mindfulness, until the awakened state becomes permanent. That is the state "in which one is present, and simultaneously observes both the inner and outer world in a passive manner".&lt;ref&gt;Ramón, J.A., ''Con los pies en el sendero del yoga y el misticismo'', p.17&lt;/ref&gt;

The awakening of a person's spiritual consciousness is a process that can be verified by that person, and it does not require him to hold any religious beliefs. In a book entitled ''La experiencia del Despertar'' (The Experience of Awakening), Shiva describes the process of awakening, and the practices that lead to it, without using any of the religious terms with which it is commonly associated. Shiva sees this work as a bridge between spirituality and science, because there is no need to believe or have faith in any of the spiritual experiences described therein, which can be confirmed empirically by the practitioner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shivashambho.wordpress.com/shiva-shambho-avatar/bhagavan-sri-shiva-shambho-el-avatar-habla-de-si-mismo-y-de-su-mision-en-el-mundo-1/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140831132048/http://shivashambho.wordpress.com/shiva-shambho-avatar/bhagavan-sri-shiva-shambho-el-avatar-habla-de-si-mismo-y-de-su-mision-en-el-mundo-1/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=August 31, 2014|title=Bhagavan Sri Shiva Shambho: el Avatar habla de sí mismo y de su misión en el mundo, 1|work=Shiva Shambho|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For those who have already reached a state of permanent spiritual wakefulness, Shiva has also laid out, in several books and lectures, the practices that lead to higher mystical experiences, which culminate with the experience of being one with the absolute.

'''Teachings on how to advance on the route of the creation of the body of light'''

These teachings address the practices needed to gradually increase the flow of energy that circulates through the body's network of energy channels,&lt;ref&gt;Ramón, J.A. (1998), ''El yoga de la energía y el yoga de la atención'', p.27&lt;/ref&gt; so as to naturally activate the spiritual faculties of the practitioner, thus eventually producing in him the same awakened state described above. The energy practices that Shiva recommends are mostly psychophysical breathing exercises or [[Pranayama]], and sexual transmutation.&lt;ref&gt;Ramón, J.A. (1998), ''El yoga de la energía y el yoga de la atención''&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Casa de los Cuatro Rumbos'' ==
In 2014, Shiva founded the [[ashram]] ''Casa de los Cuatro Rumbos'' (House of the Four Directions), near the city of [[Atlixco]]. There he teaches courses and workshops, and hosts spiritual retreats.

The '''Triassic–Jurassic extinction event''' marks the boundary between the [[Triassic]] and [[Jurassic]] periods, {{Ma|Jurassic}},&lt;ref&gt;

Some sources (Whiteside et al 2010) give a date 201.4 Ma.&lt;/ref&gt; and is one of the major [[extinction event]]s of the [[Phanerozoic]] eon, profoundly affecting life on land and in the oceans.  In the seas, a whole [[Class (biology)|class]] ([[conodont]]s)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucm.es/BUCM/revistas/geo/16986180/articulos/JIGE9696120347A.PDF The extinction of conodonts —in terms of discrete elements— at the Triassic-Jurassic boundary]&lt;/ref&gt; and 34% of marine genera disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Graham Ryder |author2=David E. Fastovsky |author3=Stefan Gartner |title=The Cretaceous-Tertiary Event and Other Catastrophes in Earth History|date=1996|publisher=Geological Society of America|isbn=9780813723075|page=19|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kAup0TOL09gC&amp;pg=PA19}}&lt;/ref&gt; On land, all [[archosaur]]s other than [[Crocodylomorpha|crocodylomorphs]] ([[Sphenosuchia]] and [[Crocodyliformes]]) and [[Avemetatarsalia]] ([[pterosaur]]s and [[dinosaur]]s), some remaining [[therapsid]]s, and many of the large [[amphibia]]ns became extinct.

==Effects==
[[Image:Triassic-jurassic boundary.jpg|thumb|350px|Ranges of families tetrapods through the Triassic and Early Jurassic]]
At least half of the species now known to have been living on Earth at that time became extinct.  This event vacated terrestrial [[ecological niche]]s, allowing the [[dinosaur]]s to assume the dominant roles in the [[Jurassic]] period. This event happened in less than 10,000 years and occurred just before [[Pangaea]] started to break apart. In the area of [[Tübingen]] ([[Germany]]), a Triassic-Jurassic [[bonebed]] can be found, which is characteristic for this boundary.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Baier: [http://www.ogv-online.de/Publikationen/Jahresberichte/2011/nf93-1.html ''Der Geologische Lehrpfad am Kirnberg (Keuper; SW-Deutschland)''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002161424/http://www.ogv-online.de/Publikationen/Jahresberichte/2011/nf93-1.html |date=2011-10-02 }}. - Jber. Mitt. oberrhein. geol. Ver, N. F. 93, 9-26, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Statistical analysis of marine losses at this time suggests that the decrease in diversity was caused more by a decrease in [[speciation]] than by an increase in extinctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Bambach | first=R.K. | last2=Knoll | first2=A.H. | last3=Wang | first3=S.C. | title=Origination, extinction, and mass depletions of marine diversity | journal=[[Paleobiology (journal)|Paleobiology]] | volume=30 | issue=4 | pages=522–542 | date=December 2004 | url=http://www.bioone.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&amp;issn=0094-8373&amp;volume=30&amp;page=522 | doi=10.1666/0094-8373(2004)030&lt;0522:OEAMDO&gt;2.0.CO;2 | postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; | issn=0094-8373 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current theories ==
Several explanations for this event have been suggested, but all have unanswered challenges:
*Gradual [[climate change]], sea-level fluctuations or a pulse of oceanic acidification&lt;ref&gt;T.M. Quan, B. van de Schootbrugge, M.P. Field, "Nitrogen isotope and trace metal analyses from the Mingolsheim core (Germany): Evidence for redox variations across the Triassic-Jurassic boundary", ''Global Biogeochemical Cycles'', '''22''' 2008: "a series of events resulting in a long period of stratification, deep-water hypoxia, and denitrification in this region of the Tethys Ocean basin"; M. Hautmann, M.J. Benton, A. Toma, "Catastrophic ocean acidification at the Triassic-Jurassic boundary", ''Neues Jahrbuch für Geologie und Paläontologie'' '''249'''.1, July 2008:119-127.&lt;/ref&gt; during the late [[Triassic]] reached a [[Tipping point (climatology)|tipping point]].  However, this does not explain the suddenness of the extinctions in the marine realm.
*Asteroid impact, but so far no impact crater of sufficient size has been dated to coincide with the Triassic–Jurassic boundary.
:The unconfirmed [[Wilkes Land crater]] is of sufficient size and falls within the correct age range at 100 million to 500 million years old and 2.5x the size of the [[Chicxulub impactor|Chicxulub]] [[Chicxulub crater|crater]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

*Massive volcanic eruptions, specifically the flood basalts of the [[Central Atlantic Magmatic Province]] (CAMP), would release [[carbon dioxide]] or [[sulfur dioxide]] and [[aerosol]]s, which would cause either intense global warming (from the former) or cooling (from the latter).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=L.

:The isotopic composition of fossil soils of [[Late Triassic|end Triassic]] and [[Early Jurassic]] has been tied to a large negative carbon isotope excursion (Whiteside et al. 2010). Carbon isotopes of lipids ([[Alkane|''n''-alkanes]]) derived from leaf wax and [[lignin]], and total organic carbon from two sections of lake sediments interbedded with the CAMP in eastern North America have shown carbon isotope excursions similar to those found in the mostly marine [[St. Audrie’s Bay]] section, Somerset, England; the correlation suggests that the end-Triassic extinction event began at the same time in marine and terrestrial environments, slightly before the oldest basalts in eastern North America but simultaneous with the eruption of the oldest flows in Morocco (Also suggested by Deenen et al., 2010), with both a critical {{CO2}} greenhouse and a  marine biocalcification crisis.
:Contemporaneous CAMP eruptions, mass extinction, and the carbon isotopic excursions are shown in the same places, making the case for a volcanic cause of a mass extinction. The catastrophic dissociation of [[Clathrate hydrate|gas hydrate]]s (suggested as one possible cause of the largest [[mass extinction]] of all time, the so-called "[[Permian-Triassic extinction event|Great Dying]]" at the end of the [[Permian]] Period) may have exacerbated greenhouse conditions.

'''William Finch''' (died 1613) was an English merchant in the service of the [[East India Company]] (EIC).

==Career==
Finch was a native of London. He was agent to an expedition sent by the [[East India Company]], under Captains Hawkins and Keeling, in 1607 to treat with the [[Great Mogul]]. Hawkins and Finch landed at [[Surat]] on 24 August 1608. They were violently opposed by the [[Portugal|Portuguese]]. Finch, however, obtained permission from the governor of [[Cambay]] to dispose of the goods in their vessels. Incited by the Portuguese, who seized two of the English ships, the natives refused to have dealings with the company's representatives. During these squabbles Finch fell ill, and Hawkins, proceeding to [[Agra]] alone, obtained favourable notice from the [[Emperor]] [[Jehangir]]. Finch recovered, and joined Hawkins at Agra on 14 April 1610. The two remained at the [[Mughal Empire|mogul]]'s court for about a year and a half, Finch refusing tempting offers to attach himself permanently to the service of Jehangir. 

Hawkins returned to England, but Finch delayed his departure in order to make further explorations, visiting Byana and Lahore among other places. Finch made careful observations on the commerce and natural products of the districts visited. In 1612 the mogul emperor confirmed and extended the privileges he had promised to Finch and Hawkins, and the [[East India Company]] in that year set up their first little [[Factory (trading post)|factory]] at Surat.

'''Worse is better''', also called '''New Jersey style''', was conceived by [[Richard P. Gabriel]] in an essay "Worse is better" to describe the dynamics of software acceptance, but it has broader application. It is the idea that [[Software quality|quality]] does not necessarily increase with functionality—that there is a point where less functionality ("worse") is a preferable option ("better") in terms of practicality and usability. Software that is limited, but simple to use, may be more appealing to the user and market than the reverse.

As to the [[oxymoron]]ic title, Gabriel calls it a caricature, declaring the style bad in comparison with "The Right Thing". However he also states that "it has better survival characteristics than the-right-thing" development style and is superior to the "MIT Approach" with which he contrasted it in the original essay.&lt;ref name="WIB"&gt;[http://dreamsongs.com/WorseIsBetter.html Worse Is Better] (Richard P. Gabriel, personal recollection)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
Gabriel was a [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] programmer when he formulated the concept in 1989, presenting it in his essay "Lisp: Good News, Bad News, How to Win Big". A section of the article, titled "The Rise of 'Worse is Better'", was widely disseminated beginning in 1991, after [[Jamie Zawinski]] found it in Gabriel's files at [[Lucid Inc.]] and e-mailed it to friends and colleagues.&lt;ref name="WIB"/&gt;

== Description ==
In ''The Rise of Worse is Better'', Gabriel claimed that "Worse-is-Better" is a model of software design and implementation which has the following characteristics (in approximately descending order of importance):

; Simplicity: The design must be simple, both in implementation and interface. It is more important for the implementation to be simple than the interface. '''Simplicity is the most important consideration in a design'''.
; Correctness: The design should be correct in all observable aspects, but '''It is slightly better to be simple than correct'''.
; Consistency: '''The design must not be overly inconsistent'''. Consistency can be sacrificed for simplicity in some cases, but it is better to drop those parts of the design that deal with less common circumstances than to introduce either complexity or inconsistency in the implementation.
; Completeness: The design must cover as many important situations as is practical. All reasonably expected cases should be covered. '''Completeness can be sacrificed in favor of any other quality'''. In fact, completeness must be sacrificed whenever implementation simplicity is jeopardized. Consistency can be sacrificed to achieve completeness if simplicity is retained; especially worthless is consistency of interface.

Gabriel argued that early [[Unix]] and [[C (programming language)|C]], developed by [[Bell Labs]], are examples of this design approach.

== The MIT approach ==
Gabriel contrasted his philosophy with what he called the "MIT/Stanford style of design" or "[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] approach" (also known as "the Right Thing"), which he described as follows. Contrasts are in bold:

; Simplicity: The design must be simple, both in implementation and interface. It is '''more important for the interface to be simple''' than the implementation.
; Correctness: The design must be correct in all observable aspects. '''Incorrectness is simply not allowed'''.
; Consistency: '''The design must be consistent'''. A design is allowed to be slightly less simple and less complete to avoid inconsistency. Consistency is as important as correctness.
; Completeness: The design must cover as many important situations as is practical. All reasonably expected cases must be covered. '''Simplicity is not allowed to overly reduce completeness'''.

== Effects ==
Gabriel argued that "Worse is better" produced more ''successful'' software than the MIT approach: As long as the initial program is basically good, it will take much less time and effort to implement initially and it will be easier to adapt to new situations. Porting software to new machines, for example, becomes far easier this way. Thus its use will spread rapidly, long before a program developed using the MIT approach has a chance to be developed and deployed ([[first-mover advantage]]). Once it has spread, there will be pressure to improve its functionality, but users have already been conditioned to accept "worse" rather than the "right thing". "Therefore, the worse-is-better software first will gain acceptance, second will condition its users to expect less, and third will be improved to a point that is almost the right thing. In concrete terms, even though [[Lisp programming language|Lisp]] compilers in 1987 were about as good as C compilers, there are many more compiler experts who want to make C compilers better than want to make Lisp compilers better."&lt;ref&gt;[http://dreamsongs.com/WIB.html Lisp: Good News, Bad News, How to Win Big], Richard P. Gabriel&lt;/ref&gt;

Gabriel credits [[Jamie Zawinski]] for excerpting the worse-is-better sections of "Lisp: Good News, Bad News, How to Win Big" and e-mailing them to his friends at [[Carnegie Mellon University]], who sent them to their friends at Bell Labs, "who sent them to their friends everywhere". He apparently connected these ideas to those of [[Richard Stallman]] and saw related ideas that are important in the [[Unix philosophy|design philosophy of Unix]], and more generally in the [[open-source movement]], both of which were central to the development of [[Linux]].

Gabriel later answered his earlier essay with one titled ''Worse Is Better Is Worse''&lt;ref&gt;[http://dreamsongs.com/Files/worse-is-worse.pdf Worse Is Better Is Worse] (PDF) (Richard P. Gabriel as "Nickieben Bourbaki")&lt;/ref&gt; under the [[pseudonym]] "Nickieben Bourbaki" (an allusion to [[Nicolas Bourbaki]]).

'''Xenobiology''' (XB) is a subfield of [[synthetic biology]], the study of synthesizing and manipulating biological devices and systems. Xenobiology derives from the Greek word [[Xenos (Greek)|''xenos'']], which means "stranger, guest". Xenobiology describes a form of biology that is not (yet) familiar to science and is not found in nature &lt;ref name="markusschmidt.eu"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schmidt|first1=Markus|title=Xenobiology: A new form of life as the ultimate biosafety tool|journal=BioEssays|date=9 March 2010|volume=32|issue=4|pages=322–331|doi=10.1002/bies.200900147|pmid=20217844|pmc=2909387}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In practice it describes novel biological systems and biochemistries that differ from the canonical [[DNA]]-[[RNA]]-20 [[amino acid]] system (see [[central dogma of molecular biology]]). For example, instead of DNA or RNA, XB explores [[nucleic acid analogues]], termed [[Xeno Nucleic Acid]] (XNA) as information carriers.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pinheiro | first1 = V.B. | last2 = Holliger | first2 = P. | year = 2012 | title = The XNA world: Progress towards replication and evolution of synthetic genetic polymers | url = | journal = Current Opinion in Chemical Biology | volume = 16 | issue = 3–4| pages = 245–252 | doi=10.1016/j.cbpa.2012.05.198| pmid = 22704981 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also focuses on an [[expanded genetic code]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bain | first1 = J.

==Difference between xeno-, exo-, and astro-biology==
"Astro" means "star" and "exo" means "outside". Both exo- and [[astrobiology]] deal with the search for naturally evolved life in the Universe, mostly on other planets in the [[circumstellar habitable zone]]. (These are also occasionally referred to as xenobiology.&lt;ref name="markusschmidt.eu"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schmidt|first1=Markus|title=Xenobiology: A new form of life as the ultimate biosafety tool|journal=BioEssays|date=9 March 2010|volume=32|issue=4|pages=322–331|doi=10.1002/bies.200900147|pmid=20217844|pmc=2909387}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Whereas astrobiologists are concerned with the detection and analysis of life elsewhere in the Universe, xenobiology attempts to design forms of life with a different biochemistry or different [[genetic code]] than on planet Earth.&lt;ref name="markusschmidt.eu"/&gt;

==Aims of xenobiology==
* Xenobiology has the potential to reveal fundamental knowledge about biology and the [[origin of life]]. In order to better understand the origin of life, it is necessary to know why life evolved seemingly via an early RNA world to the DNA-RNA-protein system and its nearly universal genetic code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pace | first1 = NR | year = 2001 | title = The universal nature of biochemistry | url = | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci USA | volume = 98 | issue = 3| pages = 805–8 | doi=10.1073/pnas.98.3.805 | pmid=11158550 | pmc=33372| bibcode = 2001PNAS...98..805P }}&lt;/ref&gt; Was it an evolutionary "accident" or were there constraints that ruled out other types of chemistries? By testing alternative biochemical "primordial soups", it is expected to better understand the principles that gave rise to life as we know it.
* Xenobiology is an approach to develop industrial production system with novel capabilities by means of enhanced biopolymer engineering and pathogen resistance. The genetic code encodes in all organisms 20 canonical amino acids that are used for protein biosynthesis. In rare cases, special amino acids such as selenocysteine, pyrrolysine or formylmethionine, can be incorporated by the translational apparatus in to proteins of some organisms.&lt;ref&gt;Wiltschi, B. and N. Budisa, Natural history and experimental evolution of the genetic code. Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology, 2007. 74: p. 739-753&lt;/ref&gt; By using additional amino acids from among the over 700 known to biochemistry, the capabilities of proteins may be altered to give rise to more efficient catalytical or material functions.  The EC-funded project Metacode,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.meta-code.eu/|title=Metacode - Home|publisher=Metacode|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019035901/http://www.meta-code.eu/|archive-date=October 18, 2016|dead-url=no|access-date=October 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example, aims to incorporate metathesis (a useful catalytical function so far not known in living organisms) into bacterial cells. Another reason why XB could improve production processes lies in the possibility to reduce the risk of virus or bacteriophage contamination in cultivations since XB cells would no longer provide suitable host cells, rendering them more resistant (an approach called semantic containment)
* Xenobiology offers the option to design a "genetic firewall", a novel biocontainment system, which may help to strengthen and diversify current bio-containment approaches.&lt;ref name="markusschmidt.eu"/&gt; One concern with traditional genetic engineering and biotechnology is [[horizontal gene transfer]] to the environment and possible risks to human health. One major idea in XB is to design alternative genetic codes and biochemistries so that horizontal gene transfer is no longer possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally alternative biochemistry also allows for new synthetic auxotrophies. The idea is to create an orthogonal biological system that would be incompatible with natural genetic systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Herdewijn | first1 = P | last2 = Marlière | first2 = P | date = Jun 2009 | title = Toward safe genetically modified organisms through the chemical diversification of nucleic acids | url = | journal = Chem Biodivers | volume = 6 | issue = 6| pages = 791–808 | doi=10.1002/cbdv.200900083| pmid = 19554563 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific approach==
In xenobiology, the aim is to design and construct biological systems that differ from their natural counterparts on one or more fundamental levels. Ideally these new-to-nature organisms would be different in every possible biochemical aspect exhibiting a very different genetic code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The long-term goal is to construct a cell that would store its genetic information not in DNA but in an alternative informational polymer consisting of xeno nucleic acids (XNA), different base pairs, using non-canonical amino acids and an altered genetic code. So far cells have been constructed that incorporate only one or two of these features.

===Xeno nucleic acids (XNA)===
{{Main|Xeno nucleic acid}}
Originally this research on alternative forms of DNA was driven by the question of how life evolved on earth and why RNA and DNA were selected by (chemical) evolution over other possible nucleic acid structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Eschenmoser | first1 = A | year = 1999 | title = Chemical etiology of nucleic acid structure | url = http://doc.rero.ch/record/293874/files/pac200072030343.pdf| journal = Science | volume = 284 | issue = 5423| pages = 2118–2124 | doi=10.1126/science.284.5423.2118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two hypotheses for the selection of RNA and DNA as life's backbone are either they are favored under life on Earth's conditions, or they were coincidentally present in pre-life chemistry and continue to be used now.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Catalysts from synthetic genetic polymers|journal = Nature|pmc = 4336857|pmid = 25470036|pages = 427–430|volume = 518|issue = 7539|doi = 10.1038/nature13982|first = Alexander I.|last = Taylor|first2 = Vitor B.|last2 = Pinheiro|first3 = Matthew J.|last3 = Smola|first4 = Alexey S.|last4 = Morgunov|first5 = Sew|last5 = Peak-Chew|first6 = Christopher|last6 = Cozens|first7 = Kevin M.|last7 = Weeks|first8 = Piet|last8 = Herdewijn|first9 = Philipp|last9 = Holliger|year = 2015|bibcode = 2015Natur.518..427T}}&lt;/ref&gt; Systematic experimental studies aiming at the diversification of the chemical structure of nucleic acids have resulted in completely novel informational biopolymers.

This study, using a binary (G/T) genetic cassette and two non-DNA bases (Hx/U), was extended to CeNA, while GNA seems to be too alien at this moment for the natural biological system to be used as template for DNA synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;Pezo V. et al. (2012). [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.201303288/abstract Binary Genetic Cassettes for Selecting XNA-Templated DNA Synthesis In Vivo]. Angew Chem. 52: 8139–8143&lt;/ref&gt; Extended bases using a natural DNA backbone could, likewise, be transliterated into natural DNA, although to a more limited extent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Krueger | first1 = AT. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2011 | title = Encoding Phenotype in Bacteria with an Alternative Genetic Set | journal = J.

Aside being used as extensions to template DNA strands, XNA activity has been tested for use as genetic [[Catalysis|catalysts]]. Although proteins are the most common components of cellular [[Enzyme|enzymatic activity]], nucleic acids are also used in the cell to catalyze reactions. A 2015 study found several different kinds of XNA, most notably FANA (2'-fluoroarabino nucleic acids), as well as HNA, CeNA and ANA (arabino nucleic acids) could be used to cleave RNA during [[Post-transcriptional modification|post-transcriptional RNA processing]] acting as XNA enzymes, hence the name XNAzymes. FANA XNAzymes also showed the ability to ligate DNA, RNA and XNA substrates.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although XNAzyme studies are still preliminary, this study was a step in the direction of searching for [[Synthetic biological circuit|synthetic circuit components]] that are more efficient than those containing DNA and RNA counterparts that can regulate DNA, RNA, and their own, XNA, substrates.

===Expanding the genetic alphabet===
{{Main|Base pair#Unnatural base pair (UBP)|l1=Unnatural base pair|Expanded genetic code}}
While XNAs have modified backbones, other experiments target the replacement or enlargement of the genetic alphabet of DNA with unnatural base pairs. For example, DNA has been designed that has - instead of the four standard bases A, T, G, and C - six bases A, T, G, C, and the two new ones P and Z (where Z stands for 6-Amino-5-nitro3-(l'-p-D-2'-deoxyribofuranosyl)-2(1H)-pyridone, and P stands for 2-Amino-8-(1-beta-D-2'-deoxyribofuranosyl)imidazo[1,2-a]-1,3,5-triazin-4 (8H)).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sismour | first1 = A.M. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2004 | title = PCR amplification of DNA containing non-standard base pairs by variants of reverse transcriptase from Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 | url = | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 32 | issue = 2| pages = 728–735 | doi=10.1093/nar/gkh241 | pmid=14757837 | pmc=373358}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yang | first1 = Z. | last2 = Hutter | first2 = D. | last3 = Sheng | first3 = P. | last4 = Sismour | first4 = A.M. | last5 = Benner | first5 = S.A. | year = 2006 | title = Artificially expanded genetic information system: a new base pair with an alternative hydrogen bonding pattern | url = | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 34 | issue = 21| pages = 6095–6101 | doi=10.1093/nar/gkl633 | pmid=17074747 | pmc=1635279}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yang | first1 = Z. | last2 = Sismour | first2 = A.M. | last3 = Sheng | first3 = P. | last4 = Puskar | first4 = N.L. | last5 = Benner | first5 = S.A. | year = 2007 | title = Enzymatic incorporation of a third nucleobase pair | url = | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 35 | issue = 13| pages = 4238–4249 | doi=10.1093/nar/gkm395| pmid = 17576683 | pmc = 1934989 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a systematic study, Leconte et al. tested the viability of 60 candidate bases (yielding potentially 3600 base pairs) for possible incorporation in the DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Leconte | first1 = A.M. | last2 = Hwang | first2 = G.T. | last3 = Matsuda | first3 = S. | last4 = Capek | first4 = P. | last5 = Hari | first5 = Y. | last6 = Romesberg | first6 = F.E. | year = 2008 | title = Discovery, characterization, and optimization of an unnatural base pair for expansion of the genetic alphabet | url = | journal = J.

In 2002, Hirao et al. developed an unnatural base pair between 2-amino-8-(2-thienyl)purine (s) and pyridine-2-one (y) that functions ''in vitro'' in transcription and translation toward a genetic code for protein synthesis containing a non-standard amino acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hirao | first1 = I. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2002 | title = An unnatural base pair for incorporating amino acid analogs into proteins | url = | journal = Nat.

In May 2014, researchers announced that they had successfully introduced two new artificial [[nucleotides]] into bacterial DNA, alongside the four naturally occurring nucleotides, and by including individual artificial nucleotides in the culture media, were able to passage the bacteria 24 times; they did not create mRNA or proteins able to use the artificial nucleotides.&lt;ref name="NYT-20140507"&gt;{{cite news |last=Pollack |first=Andrew |title=Researchers Report Breakthrough in Creating Artificial Genetic Code |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/08/business/researchers-report-breakthrough-in-creating-artificial-genetic-code.html |date=May 7, 2014 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=May 7, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NATURE-20140507"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Callaway |first=Ewen |title=First life with 'alien' DNA |url=http://www.nature.com/news/first-life-with-alien-dna-1.15179 |date=May 7, 2014 |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |doi=10.1038/nature.2014.15179 |accessdate=May 7, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NATJ-20140507"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Malyshev |first=Denis A. |last2=Dhami |first2=Kirandeep |last3=Lavergne |first3=Thomas |last4=Chen |first4=Tingjian |last5=Dai |first5=Nan |last6=Foster |first6=Jeremy M. |last7=Corrêa |first7=Ivan R. |last8=Romesberg |first8=Floyd E. |title=A semi-synthetic organism with an expanded genetic alphabet |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature13314.html |date=May 7, 2014 |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |doi=10.1038/nature13314 |accessdate=May 7, 2014 |pmid=24805238 |pmc=4058825 |volume=509 |issue=7500 |pages=385–8|bibcode=2014Natur.509..385M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Novel polymerases===
Neither the XNA nor the unnatural bases are recognized by natural [[polymerase]]s. One of the major challenges is to find or create novel types of polymerases that will be able to replicate these new-to-nature constructs. In one case a modified variant of the [[HIV]]-[[reverse transcriptase]] was found to be able to PCR-amplify an oligonucleotide containing a third type base pair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sismour | first1 = A.M. | last2 = Benner | first2 = S.A. | year = 2005 | title = The use of thymidine analogs to improve the replication of an extra DNA base pair: a synthetic biological system | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 33 | issue = 17| pages = 5640–5646 | doi=10.1093/nar/gki873 | pmid=16192575 | pmc=1236980}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Havemann | first1 = S.A. | last2 = Hoshika | first2 = S. | last3 = Hutter | first3 = D. | last4 = Benner | first4 = S.A. | year = 2008 | title = Incorporation of multiple sequential pseudothymidines by DNA polymerases and their impact on DNA duplex structure | url = | journal = Nucleosides Nucleotides Nucleic Acids | volume = 27 | issue = 3| pages = 261–278 | doi=10.1080/15257770701853679| pmid = 18260010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Pinheiro et al. (2012) demonstrated that the method of polymerase evolution and design successfully led to the storage and recovery of genetic information (of less than 100bp length) from six alternative genetic polymers based on simple nucleic acid architectures not found in nature [[Xeno nucleic acid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pinheiro | first1 = VB | display-authors = etal   | year = 2012 | title = Synthetic genetic polymers capable of heredity and evolution | url = | journal = Science | volume = 336 | issue = 6079| pages = 341–344 | doi=10.1126/science.1217622| pmid = 22517858 | bibcode = 2012Sci...336..341P | pmc = 3362463}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genetic code engineering===
One of the goals of xenobiology is to rewrite the [[genetic code]]. The most promising approach to change the code is the reassignment of seldomly used or even unused codons.&lt;ref&gt;Budisa, N. (2005). Engineering the Genetic Code - Expanding the Amino Acid Repertoire for the Design of Novel Proteins, WILEY-VHC Weinheim, New York, Brisbane, Singapore, Toronto&lt;/ref&gt; 
In an ideal scenario, the genetic code is expanded by one codon, thus having been liberated from its old function and fully reassigned to a non-canonical amino acid (ncAA) (“code expansion”).  As these methods are laborious to implement, and some short cuts can be applied (“code engineering”), for example in bacteria that are auxotrophic for specific amino acids and at some point in the experiment are fed isostructural analogues instead of the canonical amino acids for which they are auxotrophic. In that situation, the canonical amino acid residues in native proteins are substituted with the ncAAs. Even the insertion of multiple different ncAAs into the same protein is possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hoesl | first1 = M. G. | last2 = Budisa | first2 = N. | year = 2012 | title = Recent advances in genetic code engineering in Escherichia coli | url = | journal = Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. | volume = 23 | issue = 5| pages = 751–757 | doi=10.1016/j.copbio.2011.12.027 | pmid=22237016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the repertoire of 20 canonical amino acids can not only be expanded, but also reduced to 19.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pezo | first1 = V. | last2 = Guérineau | first2 = V. | last3 = Le Caer | first3 = J.-P. | last4 = Faillon | first4 = L. | last5 = Mutzel | first5 = R. | last6 = Marlière | first6 = P. | year = 2013 | title = A metabolic prototype for eliminating tryptophan from the genetic code | journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 3 | issue = | page = 1359 | doi=10.1038/srep01359 | pmid=23447021 | pmc=3584311| bibcode = 2013NatSR...3E1359P }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
By reassigning transfer RNA (tRNA)/aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase pairs the codon specificity can be changed. Cells endowed with such aminoacyl-[tRNA synthetases] are thus able to read [mRNA] sequences that make no sense to the existing gene expression machinery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rackham | first1 = O. | last2 = Chin | first2 = J.W. | year = 2005 | title = A network of orthogonal ribosome  mRNA pairs. Nat | url = | journal = Chem. Biol. | volume = 1 | issue = 3| pages = 159–166 | doi=10.1038/nchembio719| pmid = 16408021 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Altering the codon: tRNA synthetases pairs may lead to the in vivo incorporation of the non-canonical amino acids into proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wang | first1 = L. | last2 = Brock | first2 = A. | last3 = Herberich | first3 = B. | last4 = Schultz | first4 = P.G. | year = 2001 | title = Expanding the genetic code of Escherichia coli | url = | journal = Science | volume = 292 | issue = 5516| pages = 498–500 | doi=10.1126/science.1060077 | pmid=11313494| bibcode = 2001Sci...292..498W }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hartman | first1 = M.C. | last2 = Josephson | first2 = K. | last3 = Lin | first3 = C.W. | last4 = Szostak | first4 = J.W. | year = 2007 | title = An expanded set of amino acid analogs for the ribosomal translation of unnatural peptides | journal = PLOS One | volume = 2 | issue = 10| page = e972 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0000972 | pmid=17912351 | pmc=1989143| bibcode = 2007PLoSO...2..972H }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the past reassigning codons was mainly done on a limited scale. In 2013, however, Farren Isaacs and George Church at Harvard University reported the replacement of all 321 TAG stop codons present in the genome of ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' with synonymous TAA codons, thereby demonstrating that massive substitutions can be combined into higher-order strains without lethal effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lajoie | first1 = MJ | display-authors = etal   | year = 2013 | title = Genomically Recoded Organisms Expand Biological Functions | journal = Science | volume = 342 | issue = 6156| pages = 357–360 | doi=10.1126/science.1241459 | pmid=24136966 | pmc=4924538| bibcode = 2013Sci...342..357L }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the success of this genome wide codon replacement, the authors continued and achieved the reprogramming of 13 codons throughout the genome, directly affecting 42 essential genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lajoie | first1 = MJ | last2 = Kosuri | first2 = S | last3 = Mosberg | first3 = JA | last4 = Gregg | first4 = CJ | last5 = Zhang | first5 = D | last6 = Church | first6 = GM | year = 2013 | title = Probing the Limits of Genetic Recoding in Essential Genes | url = | journal = Science | volume = 342 | issue = 6156| pages = 361–3 | doi=10.1126/science.1241460 | pmid=24136967| bibcode = 2013Sci...342..361L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An even more radical change in the genetic code is the change of a triplet codon to a quadruplet and even pentaplet codon pioneered by Sisido in cell-free systems &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hohsaka | first1 = T | last2 = Sisido | first2 = M | year = 2002 | title = Incorporation of non-natural amino acids into proteins | url = | journal = Curr.

Biotechnol. | volume = 20 | issue = 2| pages = 177–182 | doi=10.1038/nbt0202-177 | pmid=11821864}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Directed evolution===
The goal of substituting DNA by XNA may also be reached by another route, namely by engineering the environment instead of the genetic modules. This approach has been successfully demonstrated by Marlière and Mutzel with the production of an ''E. coli'' strain whose DNA is composed of standard A, C and G nucleotides but has the synthetic thymine analogue 5-chlorouracil instead of thymine (T) in the corresponding positions of the sequence. These cells are then dependent on externally supplied 5-chlorouracil for growth, but otherwise they look and behave as normal ''E. coli''. These cells, however, are currently not yet fully auxotrophic for the Xeno-base since they are still growing on thymine when this is supplied to the medium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Marlière | first1 = P. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2011 | title = Chemical Evolution of a Bacterium's Genome | url = https://lirias.kuleuven.be/handle/123456789/312248| journal = Angewandte Chemie International Edition | volume = 50 | issue = 31| pages = 7109–7114 | doi=10.1002/anie.201100535| pmid = 21710668 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biosafety==
Xenobiological systems are designed to convey orthogonality to natural biological systems. A (still hypothetical) organism that uses XNA,&lt;ref&gt;Herdewijn, P. and Marlière, P. (2009) Toward safe genetically modified organisms through the chemical diversification of nucleic acids. Chem. Biodivers. 6, 791–808&lt;/ref&gt; different base pairs and polymerases and has an altered genetic code will hardly be able to interact with natural forms of life on the genetic level. Thus, these xenobiological organisms represent a genetic enclave that cannot exchange information with natural cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Marlière | first1 = P | year = 2009 | title = The farther, the safer: a manifesto for securely navigating synthetic species away from the old living world | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2759432/pdf/11693_2009_Article_9040.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Syst.

In analogy to information processing in IT, this safety concept is termed a “genetic firewall”.&lt;ref name="markusschmidt.eu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Acevedo-Rocha | first1 = CG | last2 = Budisa | first2 = N | year = 2011 | title = On the Road towards Chemically Modified Organisms Endowed with a Genetic Firewall | url = | journal = Angewandte Chemie International Edition | volume = 50 | issue = 31| pages = 6960–6962 | doi=10.1002/anie.201103010 | pmid=21710510}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of the genetic firewall seems to overcome a number of limitations of previous safety systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moe-Behrens | first1 = GH | last2 = Davis | first2 = R | last3 = Haynes | first3 = KA | year = 2013 | title = Preparing synthetic biology for the world | journal = Front Microbiol | volume = 4 | issue = | page = 5 | doi = 10.3389/fmicb.2013.00005 | pmid = 23355834 | pmc = 3554958 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wright | first1 = O | last2 = Stan | first2 = GB | last3 = Ellis | first3 = T | year = 2013 | title = Building-in biosafety for synthetic biology | url = http://mic.sgmjournals.org/content/early/2013/03/20/mic.0.066308-0.full.pdf+html | journal = Microbiology | volume = 159 | issue = 7| pages = 1221–35 | doi=10.1099/mic.0.066308-0 | pmid=23519158}}&lt;/ref&gt; A first experimental evidence of the theoretical concept of the genetic firewall was achieved in 2013 with the construction of a genomically recoded organism (GRO). In this GRO all known UAG stop codons in E.coli were replaced by UAA codons, which allowed for the deletion of release factor 1 and reassignment of UAG translation function. The GRO exhibited increased resistance to T7 bacteriophage, thus showing that alternative genetic codes do reduce genetic compatibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lajoie | first1 = MJ | display-authors = etal   | year = 2013 | title = Genomically Recoded Organisms Expand Biological Functions | journal = Science | volume = 342 | issue = 6156| pages = 357–60 | doi=10.1126/science.1241459 | pmid=24136966 | pmc=4924538| bibcode = 2013Sci...342..357L }}&lt;/ref&gt; This GRO, however, is still very similar to its natural “parent” and cannot be regarded as a genetic firewall. The possibility of reassigning the function of large number of triplets opens the perspective to have strains that combine XNA, novel base pairs, new genetic codes, etc. that cannot exchange any information with the natural biological world. 
Regardless of changes leading to a semantic containment mechanism in new organisms, any novel biochemical systems still has to undergo a toxicological screening. XNA, novel proteins, etc. might represent novel toxins, or have an allergic potential that needs to be assessed.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt M, Pei L. 2011. [http://www.markusschmidt.eu/pdf/11_03-ToxSci-Schmidt-Pei.pdf Synthetic Toxicology: Where engineering meets biology and toxicology] ''Toxicological Sciences'' 120(S1), S204–S224&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt M. 2013.

==Governance and regulatory issues==
Xenobiology might challenge the regulatory framework, as currently laws and directives deal with genetically modified organisms and do not directly mention chemically or genomically modified organisms. Taking into account that real xenobiology organisms are not expected in the next few years, policy makers do have some time at hand to prepare themselves for an upcoming governance challenge. Since 2012, the following groups have picked up the topic as a developing governance issue: policy advisers in the US,&lt;ref&gt;ISGP. 2013.
