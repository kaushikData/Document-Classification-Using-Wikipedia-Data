'''Airlines''' is an [[MS-DOS]] based [[construction and management simulation games|construction and management simulation game]] created by Interactivision later renamed InterActive Vision. The main object of the game was to successfully set up an [[airline]] by buying [[aircraft]], planning routes, setting ticket prices and dealing with events such as hostage and oil crises. The game had 4 airlines, a minimum of one of which was human controlled, the rest computer controlled. The game begins with the year set as 1970 and as time progresses more aircraft models become available corresponding with their first flights in reality.

The aircraft in the game, unlike in many other airline simulations, used real aircraft names, illustrations and model specifications.

==Sequel==
In October 2002 Interactivison released ''[[Airlines 2]]'', despite the fact that the original ''Airlines'' game was largely unknown.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} ''Airlines 2'' appeared to have slightly better market success.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Will adores Amanda ([[Giovannie Pico]]), but her best friend Kristy (Jennifer Noble) is dating the head bully Ian. Confused and angry, Will meets a mysterious, brooding character named Chance (Jon Carlo Alvarez), both of them outsiders. Chance eventually convinces Will that they should get a gun and take the bullies out: pull a [[Columbine High School massacre|Columbine]]. Amanda pleads with Will to set revenge aside, but can Will stop what he and Chance have started, or are Will's emotions too strong for him to just walk away?

'''Aplia Inc.''' is an [[educational technology]] company founded in 2000 by [[Stanford University]] professor [[Paul Romer]] that offers online homework products geared toward college-level courses. In March 2007 [[Cengage Learning]] (formerly Thomson Learning) acquired Aplia Inc. Aplia was based in [[Belmont, California|Belmont]], California until March 2014, when it relocated to Cengage Learning's new [[Mission Bay, San Francisco]] office.

==History==
In 1998, Romer created an online experiment system for use in his economics courses at [[Stanford University]] so his students would come to class better prepared and become more engaged with the course material. After other professors expressed interest in his approach, Romer decided to turn this system into the basis for a new company. He raised $10 million in venture capital to start Aplia, an online learning system. Since 2000, it has been used by over 4,300 professors, 1,200,000 students, at 1,300 colleges and universities worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aplia.com/company&lt;/ref&gt;

==Product==
Aplia’s basic product includes online homework assignments that professors can assign to students in accounting, business communication, business law, developmental reading, economics, finance, marketing, philosophy, statistics, and taxation. While the basic premise behind each course is the same, course materials vary; in many cases, Aplia problem sets are designed to complement specific textbook from a variety of publishers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aplia.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Aplia support representatives set up and edit courses per the professor's schedule. Assignment types include problem sets, news analyses, tutorials, and (for economics) interactive market experiments.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Aplia is often integrated with textbooks from different publishers.  Aplia's questions are written by content experts in their respective fields and the problem sets match the tone, difficulty level, style, of the textbook. Aplia works with publishers, authors, and contributors, and many users believe the quality is decent.&lt;ref&gt;http://amplicate.com/hate/aplia&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/05/07/AR2009050704299_pf.html|title=Steven Pearlstein - An Economist, an Academic Puzzle and a Lot of Promise|website=www.washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of pricing, many of Aplia's products have a low-cost digital textbook as well as Aplia. In the Friday, May 9 issue of ''The Washington Post'', author Steven Pearlstein writes: "Aplia also paves the way for the textbook industry to ditch a lousy business model in which it has to charge ridiculously high prices for new books because it cannot collect anything from the students who buy them on the used-book market. Instead, publishers could move to a more sustainable model in which the textbook is priced close to the cost of printing and shipping (say, $20), while all students are charged a reasonable fee (say, $60) for what really matters, which is the content of the textbook, the labs and homework exercises."&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"/&gt;

Research has also shown Aplia to be less effective in the classroom for students who require an indepth relationship with the teacher. Studies are surfacing to find online learning to be another challenge that students must overcome in order to learn a subject they might be unfamiliar with. Some anecdotal evidence has been found that schools administration have found value in the micromanagement software features that Aplia offers, especially with keeping students on track with their assignments and increasing engagement and participation in the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13504850600993663|title=‘D’ is for dilly-dally?|first1=Arthur J.|last1=Caplan|first2=John|last2=Gilbert|date=21 November 2008|publisher=|journal=Applied Economics Letters|volume=15|issue=14|pages=1085–1088|via=Taylor and Francis+NEJM|doi=10.1080/13504850600993663}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aplia.com/company/press/ael_010107.jsp&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aplia features==

===Chapter assignments and problem sets===
Chapter assignments (or problem sets)--groups of questions based on each chapter of a textbook—are automatically graded and provide students with explanations for every question. All problems are randomized and written by a team of subject matter experts. Most assignments use "Grade It Now" technology. Students are given three attempts on each problem; if they don't like their score after their first attempt, they may try a second time; if they don’t like their score after two, they may try a third; they don't have to use all three attempts. Scores are averaged.

===News analyses===
In economics and finance, Aplia regularly features economics and finance articles from new sources. Each story includes a summary and follow-up questions.

===Experiments===
For economics, Aplia offers real-time, online market experiments to help students understand what the real market environment is like. Each experiment is supported by assignments that prepare students for this and help them analyze their results. These experiments have had proven success in the classroom as well—according to research, Aplia's methods provide college students with means to truly learn the material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|ssrn=708841|title=Conducting a Double Oral Auction Experiment in a High School Computer Lab: A Pilot Study|first=Paul R.|last=Johnson|date=1 March 2005|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multimedia===
All of Aplia's courses use multimedia to pique students' interest. Developmental Reading, for instance, uses audio so students can hear how vocabulary words are pronounced; Logic uses interactive Venn diagrams, truth tables, and natural deduction proofs so students keep learning the material hands-on.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aplia.com/developmentalreading&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aplia.com/philosophy|title=Aplia|website=www.aplia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assessment and grading===
Aplia keeps instructors informed about student participation, progress, and real-time graphical reports. Instructors can download, save, manipulate, print, import, and export student grades. Gradebook Analytics allow instructors to monitor and address performance on a student-by-student and topic-by-topic basis.

===Course management system===
Instructors can post announcements, upload course materials, host student discussions, e-mail students, and manage their gradebook with Aplia’s course management system. Aplia works independently or in conjunction with other course management systems.

==Aplia criticism==

===Additional course fees and registration fees===
Students are charged (per course) additional registration fees on top of their home institutions tuition or per unit fees. This may amount to more than the parent institution's total cost for the entire course when including materials fees. This has been regarded by some to be a "troubling lack of transparency regarding the total net costs associated with getting a college degree."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bostinno.com/channels/should-students-pay-to-submit-homework-publishers-think-so/|title=Should Students Pay to Submit Homework? Publishers Think So|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Outsourcing jobs ===
In 2015 several employees were asked to gather in the main conference room where a tactic of "psychological divide and conquer" separated the employees into the first of many days and weeks of learning that not only was their job being sent overseas that they would be shadowed by their replacement whom they would train.

One employee told Computer World "The employees were warned that speaking to the news media meant loss of severance" Once the story broke the company ignored media contacts and plowed ahead on a double down strategy of cutting costs and pressuring employees vs focusing on a total quality management strategy that was recommended by members of the Board and its Founder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerworld.com/article/3002681/it-outsourcing/fury-and-fear-in-ohio-as-it-jobs-go-to-india.html|title=Fury and fear in Ohio as IT jobs go to India|first=Patrick|last=Thibodeau|work=computerworld.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Started in 1962, the '''Canada-Wide Science Fair''' ('''CWSF''') is an annual [[science fair]] in [[Canada]] coordinated by [http://www.youthscience.ca Youth Science Canada]. Finalists qualify from approximately 25,000 competitors at over 100 Youth Science Canada-affiliated regional science fairs in every province and territory, or, in the province of [[Quebec]], the provincial science fair.

Competition is split into three age/grade categories: Junior for grades 7 and 8, Intermediate for grades 9 and 10, and Senior for grades 11, 12 and Cégep.

The Canada-Wide Science Fair is a weeklong event. Students travel with their respective regional representatives to the designated location (listed below). The Canada-Wide Science Fair has been held every year since 1962. The Canada-Wide Science Fair was presented by [[BlackBerry Limited|Blackberry]] from 2012 through 2014.

==History==

The First Canada-Wide Science Fair was held May 11 and 12, 1962 at the Science Building at [[Carleton University]] in Ottawa. In 1962, the fair was co-sponsored by the Kiwanis Club of Ottawa Incorporated. The initial Headquarters for the Canadian Science Fairs Council was 45 Rideau Street, Ottawa. The two-day science fair was made up of 45 exhibits of regional winners from secondary school fairs across the country.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/46195627/ The Ottawa Journal (Ottawa, Ontario) May 12, 1962 Page 3 science fair]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Intel International Science and Engineering Fair (Intel ISEF) ==
Several competitors and winners from the Canada-Wide Science Fair have been selected for competition at the [[Intel International Science and Engineering Fair]] as part of Team Canada, among them inventors [[Ann Makosinski]] and [[Alex Deans]]. Past Canada-Wide Science Fair winners [[Raymond Wang]] and Austin Wang both from [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia|BC]], won the Gordon E. Moore award at Intel ISEF in 2015 and 2016, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://youthscience.ca/news/austin-wang-wins-top-prize-intel-international-science-and-engineering-fair|title=Austin Wang wins Top Prize at Intel International Science and Engineering Fair  {{!}} Youth Science Canada|website=youthscience.ca|access-date=2016-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards ==
Almost $1 million in awards and scholarships is given out each year at the Canada-Wide Science Fair.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://youthscience.ca/news/top-prizes-awarded-canada-wide-science-fair-0|title=Top Prizes Awarded at Canada-Wide Science Fair {{!}} Youth Science Canada|website=youthscience.ca|access-date=2016-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Bronze, silver, and gold medals are awarded to outstanding projects in each age/grade category (see above). Challenge awards are presented for the best project in each of seven STEM challenges (discovery, energy, environment, health, information, innovation and resources) for each age/grade category. Sponsored special awards are also offered.
Three Grand Awards recognize the top project from the gold medal winners in each age/grade category: The Best Project Award (including $2,500 cash) is presented to the top overall project, regardless of category. The top projects from the two remaining categories receive Platinum Awards, which include $1,000 cash. Two or three of the platinum award winners compete at the [[European Union Contest for Young Scientists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youthscience.ca/news/team-canada-heading-eucys-2017|title=Team Canada heading to EUCYS 2017|last=Bainbridge|first=Alisha|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Between 2010 and 2015 The Centre observed improvement made by 160 [[Academy (English school)|academy schools]] after they were put into [[special measures]] by [[OfSTED]]. The collected data was shared with [[The Future Leaders Trust|Andrew Day]], executive director (CEO) of [[The Northumberland Church of England Academy]]; Carolyn Robson CBE, executive principal of [[Rushey Mead Academy]]; David Bateson OBE, chair of EMLC Academy Trust Strategic Board; George Gyte, adviser to the [[Department for Education]] and [[Tony Blair]]'s Prime Minister's Delivery Unit; Professor Sir George Berwick, CEO of [[London Challenge|Challenge Partners]]; Dame Sally Coates, Director of Academies for [[United Learning]] and Laura McInerney, [[The Guardian|Guardian]] columnist and editor of ''Schools Week'', who described it as "some of the most powerful and engaging ever seen in education research".&lt;ref name="meet"/&gt;

The methodology was presented to the 2015 [[British Academy of Management]] conference in Portsmouth, and the preliminary findings were presented to the 2016 [[Global Education and Skills Forum]] conference in Dubai&lt;ref name="Varkey Foundation"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-37717211 | title=School system does not reward the best head teachers|date=20 October 2016|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=|publisher=[[BBC]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; and published the following day by ''[[The Times]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/failing-academies-pay-to-offload-difficult-children-g2xrkpf5m|title=Failing academies 'pay to offload difficult children'|date=14 March 2016|work=The Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/12192753/Unruly-pupils-excluded-by-failing-academies-to-boost-standards.html|title=Unruly pupils 'excluded by failing academies to boost standards'|date=14 March 2016|work=The Telegraph}},&lt;/ref&gt;''[[Oxford Mail|The Oxford Mail]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/news/14340817.Oxford_academic_accuses_academies_of_offloading_disruptive_pupils/|title=Oxford academic accuses academies of offloading disruptive pupils|date=13 March 2016|work=The Oxford Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Yorkshire Post]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/education/failing-academies-excluding-naughty-pupils-academic-claims-1-7794912 | title=Failing academies 'excluding naughty pupils' academic claims|date=14 March 2016| work=[[The Yorkshire Post]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The full findings were sent to The [[Department for Education]] as an [[SSRN]] academic paper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|ssrn=2769868|title=Performance Metrics, Practice, and Implications: Lessons from Academy Schools in the UK|date=25 April 2016|publisher=[[Oxford University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and published by ''[[The Independent]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/academies-are-excluding-poor-quality-students-yet-more-social-cleansing-from-the-conservative-a6993401.html|title=Academies are socially cleansing their student population|date=20 April 2016|work=[[The Independent]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK [[Conservative Party (UK)|government]] responded by launching an inquiry into the performance, accountability and governance of academy schools. The [[Department for Education]] subsequently released a [[white paper]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://schoolsweek.co.uk/the-6-secrets-of-school-turnarounds-as-revealed-by-study-of-160-academies/|title=What does the British Olympic boxing team and a successful academy have in common?|date=24 March 2016|work=Schools Week}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://schoolsweek.co.uk/excluded-pupils-will-still-count-in-schools-results/|title=Excluded pupils will still count in school's results|date=24 March 2016|work=Schools Week}}&lt;/ref&gt; and created the 'Education for All Bill' to "stamp out the practice of academies that exclude pupils to skew their results and claim rapid improvements after The Centre for High Performance revealed some trusts excluded pupils to change the profile of their intake and boost results."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://schoolsweek.co.uk/queens-speech-law-change-will-make-schools-responsible-for-excluded-pupils/|title=Queen's Speech: Law change will make schools responsible for excluded pupils|date=18 May 2016|work=Schools Week}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following this policy change the Centre wrote 'How to Turn Around a Failing School'&lt;ref name="Harvard Business Review"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hbr.org/2016/08/how-to-turn-around-a-failing-school|title=How to Turn Around a Failing School|date=5 August 2016|work=Harvard Business Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first article on UK schools to be published by [[Harvard Business Review]], who lauded this influential work as "research gold". Three days later The Centre published an article in [[Duke Corporate Education|Duke CE's]] Dialogue Journal titled 'Why English schools hold secret to high business performance'&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; suggesting "organisations cannot be turned around with one simple idea or single action."

==Leadership==
In 2016, The Centre investigated the impact of different types of leaders on performance, beginning with the so-called "superhead" system of executive head teachers. The findings of this study were published by ''Schools Week''&lt;ref name=true&gt;{{cite web|url=http://schoolsweek.co.uk/superheads-the-true-cost-to-schools/|title=Superheads: the true cost to schools|date=15 April 2016|work=Schools Week}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://schoolsweek.co.uk/super-heroes-dont-solve-problems-they-punch-people/|title=Why asking school leaders to be superheads is a really bad idea|date=15 April 2016|work=Schools Week}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[The Times]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/education/article4723183.ece|title=Superheads boost results but leave schools in chaos|date=29 March 2016|work=The Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lead research Alex Hill concluded "when a school emerges from a period with a superhead, you've lost three years, sometimes longer, and you've spent a load of money you didn't need to. You are now behind where you could have been both in terms of the impact on students but also on your community."&lt;ref name=true/&gt;

Eight months later, the Centre wrote 'The One Type of Leader Who Can Turn Around a Failing School'.&lt;ref name="Harvard Business Review 2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hbr.org/2016/10/the-one-type-of-leader-who-can-turn-around-a-failing-school|title=The One Type of Leader Who Can Turn Around a Failing School|date=20 October 2016|work=Harvard Business Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chloe Brown''' is a longtime educator in the [[Tulsa, Oklahoma|Tulsa]] Public School district, who was the first African-American teacher at Eliot Elementary School. She is an active member of the Tulsa community, volunteering to tutor homeless children, distribute food, and work with women in crisis. Brown founded The Chloe House in 2006, a transition home for women that provides housing, training for employment, and resources to help them re-enter society. She is also a licensed minister and was inducted into the [[Oklahoma Women's Hall of Fame]] in 2011.

==Early life==
Chloe L. Brown was born in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]] and grew up in the historic [[Greenwood, Tulsa|Greenwood District]]. The church played a large role during her childhood, as her father was a minister and would host church services in their home. Brown's mother highly valued education and insured that her children value the institution equally. From this early influence, Brown was determined to become and educator and developed an early passion for the profession. The first school Brown attended was [http://burroughs.tulsa.schooldesk.net/ John Burroughs Elementary]. Brown's was the first class to integrate John Burroughs, though she does not have explicit negative memories of strained race relations. Brown eventually graduated from [[Booker T. Washington High School (Tulsa, Oklahoma)|Booker T. Washington High School]] and went on to earn a bachelor's degree in education from [[Langston University]] in 1975. Brown was the first in her family to graduate from college.&lt;ref name="Oral History Project"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nykolaiszyn|first1=Juliana|title=Oral history interview with Chloe Brown|journal=Inductees of the Oklahoma Women's Hall of Fame Oral History Project|date=January 3, 2012|url=http://dc.library.okstate.edu/cdm/ref/collection/Fame/id/797|accessdate=24 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brown also holds a master's degree in Elementary Education Administration from [[Northeastern State University]].

==Career==
Brown taught her first class at Cooper Elementary School with Dr. Joann Bell. Later, Brown was the first African-American teacher at Eliot Elementary School in Tulsa, one of the elementary schools that fed into [https://web.archive.org/web/20150626152604/https://www.casciahall.org/Default.aspx Cascia Hall] and [https://www.montecassino.org/site/sections/1 Monte Cassino]. After spending several years at Eliot, Brown moved for a brief time to North Dallas and taught there for three years. Upon returning to Tulsa, Brown was promoted to the administrative level, but soon after she happily returned to the classroom after her brief time in administration and teaches at McClure Elementary School.

Outside of the classroom, Brown found a passion for helping the homeless and more specifically, rehabilitating incarcerated women. Brown and her husband created the Chloe House in 2006, a transition home that aided the reintegration of incarcerated women into society by providing housing and training for employment. She is also a member of the Greenwood Christian Center and is a licensed [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]].&lt;ref name="OK women hall of fame 2011"&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 Oklahoma Women's Hall of Fame|url=http://www.ok.gov/ocsw/Oklahoma_Women's_Hall_of_Fame/2011_Oklahoma_Women's_Hall_of_Fame/|publisher=Oklahoma Commission on the Status of Women|accessdate=24 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 27, 2016, Chloe L. Brown officially launched her campaign for Tulsa Public Schools Board District 2, vowing to bring her 44 years of experience from a lifelong career educating Tulsa children and empowering them to become lifelong learners. “Right now our children and educators need leadership on our school board from experienced teachers. During the span of my 44 year career in public education, I have taught in a variety of schools all over Tulsa. I know firsthand the basic needs of our children, as well as the essential tools our educators need to empower them to succeed,” said Brown. “I will fight for our children and teachers every day.” Election day is Tuesday, February 14, 2017.

The '''Collegiate Learning Assessment''' (CLA) is a [[standardized testing]] initiative in [[United States]] [[higher education|higher]] [[educational evaluation]] and [[Educational assessment|assessment]]. It uses a "value-added" [[outcomes-based education|outcome]] model to examine a college or university's contribution to student learning which relies on the institution, rather than the individual student, as the primary unit of analysis.  The CLA measures are designed to test for [[critical thinking]], [[analytic reasoning]], [[problem solving]], and written communication skills.  The assessment consists of open-ended questions, is administered to students online, and controls for incoming academic ability. An institution's average score on the CLA measures correlates highly with the institution's average [[SAT]] score (r = 0.90).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Benjamin|first=Robert|author2=Chun, Marc|title=A New Field of Dreams: The Collegiate Learning Assessment Project|journal=Peer Review 5|year=2003|volume=4|pages=26–29|url=http://www.aacu.org/peerreview/pr-su03/pr-su03feature2.cfm|accessdate=2011-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Institutional results are not published.

==History and Test Format==
The CLA was first launched in 2000 by the Council for Aid to Education (CAE), a national nonprofit organization based in New York City. Rather than testing for specific content knowledge gained in particular courses or majors, the intent was to assess “the collective and cumulative result of what takes place or does not take place over the four to six years of undergraduate education in and out of the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hersch|first=Richard|title=Going Naked|journal=Peer Review|year=2007|volume=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the entire test, the most well-developed and sophisticated part is its performance task component,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Arum, Richard |author2=Roksa, Josipa |title=Academically Adrift: Limited Learning on College Campuses|year=2011|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=536}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which students are given ninety minutes to respond to a writing prompt that is associated with a set of background documents. The testing materials, including the documents, are accessed through a computer. CAE has published several examples of representative performance tasks, one of which is described below (from [[Academically Adrift]]: Limited Learning on College Campuses):

:The “DynaTech” performance task asks students to generate a memo advising an employer about the desirability of purchasing a type of airplane that has recently crashed. Students are informed: “You are the assistant to Pat Williams, the president of DynaTech, a company that makes precision electronic instruments and navigational equipment. Sally Evans, a member of DynaTech’s sales force, recommended that DynaTech buy a small private plane (a SwiftAir 235) that she and other members of the sales force could use to visit customers. Pat was about to approve the purchase when there was an accident involving a SwiftAir 235.” Students are provided with the following set of documents for this activity: newspaper articles about the accident, a federal accident report on in-flight breakups in single engine planes, Pat Williams’s e-mail to her assistant and Sally Evans’s e-mail to Pat Williams, charts on SwiftAir’s performance characteristics, an article from Amateur Pilot magazine comparing SwiftAir 235 to similar planes, and pictures and descriptions of SwiftAir models 180 and 235. Students are then instructed to “prepare a memo that addresses several questions, including what data support or refute the claim that the type of wing on the SwiftAir 235 leads to more in-flight breakups, what other factors might have contributed to the accident and should be taken into account, and your overall recommendation about whether or not DynaTech should purchase the plane."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Arum, Richard |author2=Roksa, Josipa |title=Academically Adrift: Limited Learning on College Campuses|year=2011|publisher=University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CAE also publishes its scoring rubric.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Collegiate Learning Assessment Common Scoring Rubric|
url=http://cae.org/claptrubric|
work=Council for Aid to Education|publisher=New York: Council for Aid to Education, 2008|
accessdate=2013-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design of both the prompts and the criteria for evaluation demonstrates the CLA's focus on complex, holistic, real-world problem-solving as a measurement of high level learning. As a result, the argument goes, institutions that attempt to “teach to the test” will be schools that teach students “to think critically, reason analytically, solve problems, and communicate clearly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shavelson|first=Richard|title=The Collegiate Learning Assessment|journal=Ford Policy Forum 2008: Forum for the Future of Higher Education|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
Again according to ''Academically Adrift'', there are four primary criticisms of the CLA. Two criticisms relate to the [[Validity (logic)|validity]] of the instrument:

#By focusing on general skills rather than [[domain knowledge]] and specialization, the instrument may lack the [[construct validity]] to measure the specialized knowledge that students go to college to obtain.
#The CLA lacks instrumental validity to measure individual performance. This concern, however, may have been partially addressed by a 2009 test validity study organized by the Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education (FIPSE). The results showed that while these tests should not be used as a basis to make institutional decisions about students as individuals (e.g., promotion or course placement), when aggregated in larger samples they can provide reliable estimates of institutional or group-level differences in performance on these tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Arum, Richard |author2=Roksa, Josipa |title=Academically Adrift: Limited Learning on College Campuses|year=2011|publisher=University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Klein|first=Stephen|author2=Ou Lydia Liu |author3=James Sconing |title=Test Validity Study (TVS) Report|date=September 29, 2009|url=http://cae.org/images/uploads/pdf/13_Test_Validity_Study_Report.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two other criticisms relate to the normative implications of the CLA:

#An aversion to standardized testing in general and a belief that there is accountability in higher education due to market forces. That is, if students were not gaining something through education then they would not be paying for it. On this view, the CLA is a waste of time and money.
#The use of the test implies that the value-added from higher education can be measured. Individuals who oppose the idea that learning consists of acquiring specific knowledge or mental constructs, or is intended to improve performance on some measure (such as income or lifespan), may therefore oppose the measurement of learning.

The '''European Agency for Special Needs and Inclusive Education''' is an independent organisation that acts as a platform for collaboration for its 30 member countries, working towards ensuring more inclusive education systems. The Agency’s mission is to help member countries improve the quality and effectiveness of their inclusive provision for all learners.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.european-agency.org/about-us&lt;/ref&gt;

All European countries are committed to working towards ensuring more inclusive education systems. They do so in different ways, depending on their past and current contexts and histories. Inclusive education systems are seen as a vital component within the wider aspiration of more socially inclusive societies that all countries align themselves with, both ethically and politically.

The ultimate vision for inclusive education systems is '''to ensure that all learners of any age are provided with meaningful, high-quality educational opportunities in their local community, alongside their friends and peers'''.

The Agency has a mandate from its member countries to facilitate collaboration regarding country priorities that are in line with the [[European Council]] priorities as identified in the ET 2020 strategy &lt;ref&gt;Education and Training 2020 strategic framework: http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/education_training_youth/general_framework/ef0016_en.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and in accordance with international agreements, such as the United Nations [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] and the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]].

The Agency was established in 1996 as an initiative of the Danish Ministry of Education. The Agency Secretariat is based in Odense, Denmark and the Agency has an office in Brussels, Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;Agency offices: http://www.european-agency.org/about-us/contact-us&lt;/ref&gt;

Through its activities the Agency facilitates the collection, processing and transfer of European level and country specific information in the area of inclusive education, and it provides opportunities for sharing different types of knowledge and experiences. 

==Members==
At present the Agency has 31 member countries: Austria, Belgium (Flemish and French speaking communities), Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Serbia, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom (England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales).  &lt;ref&gt;Agency member countries: https://www.european-agency.org/country-information&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
Agency activities work towards the ET 2020 strategic objective ‘'''promoting equity, social cohesion and active citizenship'''’. In line with this objective, the main focus of the Agency’s work is upon inclusive education and the characteristics of provision for all learners, in particular those who are vulnerable to marginalisation and exclusion, such as students with disabilities and/or special educational needs.

By analysing and identifying key factors that hinder or support positive developments, the Agency provides member countries with recommendations and guidelines for policy and practice and then shares information about the reality of inclusive education across Europe.

In its activities, the Agency focuses on priorities established by member countries within the framework of its annual and multi-annual work programmes. Annual reports presenting an overview of annual activities are available online.&lt;ref&gt;Agency Annual Report 2015: https://www.european-agency.org/about-us/what-we-do/annual-reports&lt;/ref&gt;

==Project work==
All thematic projects focus upon issues of common concern for policy makers for special needs and inclusive education. The topics to be examined within thematic projects are identified via a systemic collection of information on the priorities countries have.

Priority topics include [[early childhood intervention]], assessment in inclusive settings, [[teacher education]] for inclusion, [[vocational education]] and training, ICT for inclusion, information accessibility and data collection in the field on SNE.&lt;ref&gt;Agency projects: http://www.european-agency.org/agency-projects&lt;/ref&gt;

These events were organised for young people with and without disabilities in order to provide them an opportunity to express their views about inclusive education and to reach policy-makers. Results from the Hearings have been presented to key decision makers at both national and European levels for their consideration and further action.

==History==

===1996–2001===
The Agency was established in 1996 as an initiative of the Danish Ministry of Education, at the end of the EC programme Helios II.&lt;ref&gt;Helios II EC programme: http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:1999:098:0035:0037:EN:PDF&lt;/ref&gt; Representatives from the ministries of education from the 15 member countries of the European Union, as well as Norway and Iceland, supported the initiative as a means of furthering their co-operation in the field of special needs and inclusive education.&lt;ref&gt;Agency history: https://www.european-agency.org/about-us/who-we-are/history&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Agency history: http://ec.europa.eu/education/jean-monnet/institutions_en.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The first phase of the Agency’s existence was a three-year trial period that ran until the end of July 1999 and was largely funded by the Danish authorities. The Secretariat was therefore established in Odense, Denmark. The European Commission, through the Directorate General for Education, provided financial support to projects.

Ministries of education of the member countries ensured that the work of the Agency was beneficial for that country through the nomination of appropriate people appointed to work with the Agency. These are the Representative Board member, the National Co-ordinator and national experts.&lt;ref&gt;Organisational structure of the Agency: https://www.european-agency.org/about-us/who-we-are/structure&lt;/ref&gt;
Starting August 1999 all the member countries took an equal governance of the Agency. In 1999 another Agency office was established in Brussels.
The European Commission continued to support concrete Agency activities aimed at analysing and disseminating key information in the field of special needs education across Europe as well as supporting and disseminating information relating to the [[Socrates programme]].

Between 1997 and 2001 the Agency’s work focused on creating a platform for co-operation at European level through the national networks built up in all countries as well as through its website.

===2002–2006===
Increased budgetary support during 2002, mainly via the budget line approved by the European Parliament, facilitated more stable and long-term development of the Agency’s activities. The Agency benefited from an operating grant from 2002 until 2004.

In 2004, the Agency was included in the Decision No 791/2004/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council,&lt;ref&gt;Decision No 791/2004/EC: http://eur-lex.europa.eu/lex/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2004:138:0031:0039:EN:PDF&lt;/ref&gt; this decision provided a legal basis for the Agency and ensured the provision of an operating grant until 2006.

By this time the work was focused on firmly consolidating and strengthening the Agency’s position as the platform for co-operation at European level. Co-operation activities took place with European and international organisations. The Agency website was expanded and national networks were extended in all countries through the involvement of nominated national experts participating in the Agency projects.

===Since 2007===
The Agency now has 30 member countries. Since 2007 it has welcomed Slovenia and the Slovak Republic as member countries. The newest member is Bulgaria, who joined in 2017.

Since 2007 the Agency has been one of six European institutions supported with an operating grant under the Jean Monnet initiative within the EU [[Lifelong Learning Programme 2007–2013]] and similarly under the [[Jean Monnet]] initiative&lt;ref&gt;Agency supported by the Jean Monnet Programme: http://ec.europa.eu/education/lifelong-learning-programme/doc88_en.htm&lt;/ref&gt; within the new EU Erasmus+&lt;ref&gt;Erasmus + EU programme for education, Training, Youth and Sport for 2014-2020 http://ec.europa.eu/programmes/erasmus-plus/index_en.htm&lt;/ref&gt; education programme (2014-2020).

In terms of thinking, implementation and language usage, the concept ‘[[special needs education]]’ has shifted towards ‘[[inclusive education]]’. Similarly, the way of thinking about learners’ needs has moved from the concept of ‘special educational needs’ towards ‘additional needs’.

In 2014 the Agency changed its name from ''European Agency for Development in Special Needs Education'' to '''European Agency for Special Needs and Inclusive Education''', as member country representatives believe that the new name represents better the Agency’s views and mission.

==Co-operative relationships==
The Agency maintains active working relationships with other specialist European organisations &lt;ref&gt; Video on European co-operation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBcGvt9bElk&lt;/ref&gt; working in the field of inclusive and special needs education as well as with key international bodies and organisations in the education sector, such as [[UNESCO]] &lt;ref&gt;Agency IEA project cooperation with UNESCO http://www.european-agency.org/agency-projects/iea&lt;/ref&gt; and its institutes ([[International Bureau of Education]] /IBE, and International Institute for Information Technologies in Education/ITTE&lt;ref&gt;Agency co-operation with UNESCO-ITTE: http://iite.unesco.org/publications/3214682/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Agency co-operation with UNESCO-ITTE: http://www.european-agency.org/news/new-collaborative-publication-on-the-use-of-icts-in-education-for-people-with-disabilities&lt;/ref&gt;), the UNICEF CEE/CIS regional office,&lt;ref&gt;UNICEF CEE/CIS Regional Office: http://www.unicef.org/ceecis/16422.html&lt;/ref&gt; the [[OECD]], the [[International Labour Organization]] and the [[World Bank]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4732">'''Florida State University-Panama''', or '''FSU-Panama''' is an [[international branch campus]] of [[Florida State University]] located on the [[isthmus]] of [[Panama]].&lt;ref&gt;http://international.fsu.edu/index.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; FSU has operating a broad curriculum program in [[Panama City]] of the Republic of Panama for over 50 years.&lt;ref&gt;http://international.fsu.edu/Types/College/Panama/Panama.aspx 8/19/2009&lt;/ref&gt; The campus, located by the [[Miraflores (Panama)|Miraflores Locks]] of the [[Panama Canal]], provides students with many facilities, including the largest English-language library in the Republic of Panama, computer facilities, research facilities, student housing, and athletic facilities. The student population is generally international and comes from the United States, the Republic of Panama and other countries.

==History==
The first campus was established in 1957&lt;ref&gt;http://international.fsu.edu/Types/College/Panama/Panama.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; and served as an academic institution where U.S. military and [[Zonian]]s located in the [[Panama Canal Zone]] could continue their education while staying in [[Panama]].

In the 1990s, the university was located in the Albrook 808 Building in a former [[U.S. Army Air Force]] station. Courses on international affairs, computer science, psychology, and economics were given. Most of the students were U.S. citizens or relatives. After Albrook was reverted to the Panamanian state, FSU moved to the Chino Panameno School, giving classes at night for people who worked from 1997-1999.

The campus had various locations in [[Panama City]], but was for many years located in ''La Boca'' (The Mouth), near the mouth of the Pacific entrance to the [[Panama Canal]].

In summer 2009, the campus relocated to the ''Ciudad del Saber'' or the [[Ciudad del Saber|City of Knowledge]],&lt;ref&gt;http://panama.fsu.edu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=80&amp;Itemid=1&lt;/ref&gt; a reverted area which was previously a [[U.S. Army]] base, [[Fort Clayton]], but was closed in 1999 per the [[Torrijos–Carter Treaties]].

In fall 2013, the satellite campus began offering a master's degree in International Affairs.&lt;ref&gt;http://panama.fsu.edu/academics/graduate-program/masters-in-international-affairs/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2846">'''Fort Roosevelt''' was located at Roosevelt Elementary School in [[Hanford, California]].  It was a {{convert|1|acre|m2|adj=on}} fort surrounded by almost 1000 telephone poles in the style of a fort from the [[Old West]]. Outdoor education was delivered there and Fort Roosevelt became a nationally-recognized model for [[environmental education]] in schools.{{cn|date=April 2014}}  The fort included a [[wildlife rehabilitation]] center that served the entire [[San Joaquin Valley]].  As a tourist attraction, it drew 30,000 visitors a year.  The facility was started by then-principal Jim Parks beginning in the late 1960s.  Heidi Arroues was the fort's facilitator from 1983 to 2005. 

In 2005, the Hanford Elementary School District's board of trustees decided not to make needed repairs to Fort Roosevelt and the fort was demolished despite public opposition. The board was actually "strong armed" into destruction of the beloved Fort by Rebecca Presley, the Superintendent of the elementary school district at the time. She waged an unscrupulous heavy handed campaign involving attorneys and land developers which ultimately doomed the Fort. If it had not been for the historical classification of the train station that had been part of the Fort, it also would have been destroyed at her whim. Immediately after the demolition of the Fort, Ms. Presley, having been investigated no less than three times by the CA Grand Jury, retired and moved to Seattle, WA; ostensibly to be close to her children.

A film called ''Fort Roosevelt Requiem'' has been made by filmmaker David Dibble who had experienced the fort as a child.&lt;ref&gt;http://www./fortroosevelt.com/ accessed 7-4-09&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Freedom and Culture''''' is a book by [[John Dewey]]. Published in 1939, the book is an analytical defense of [[democracy]] written in a time when democratic regimes had recently been replaced by non-democratic ones, and at a time when [[Marxism]] was considered a powerful political force.

==Chapters==
===The problem of freedom===
According to Dewey, human nature is the result of many forces, many of which are [[culturally determined]]. Attempts have been made to explain human behavior as being primarily motivated by love of freedom, or by pursuit of self-interest, or by the pursuit of power, or being primarily determined by economic conditions. All of these are products of their times and their inevitable falsification results in a backlash, de-emphasizing the formerly over-emphasized factor.

===Culture and human nature===
According to Dewey, freedom had been associated with individuality by some people and with rationality, or law, by others. It has also been associated with the farming class by some people and with capitalists by others. [[Individualism]] (or liberty) and [[social control]] (or law) have been proposed as two extremes between which freedom has to navigate. In reality, the individual and the social forces interact in various ways, rather than being two distinct extremes.

Therefore, for individuals to be free, appropriate social conditions must exist. Democratic conditions do not automatically maintain themselves and they cannot be mechanically prescribed in a constitution. [[Dictatorship]]s exist not only through coercion but also by appealing to certain idealistic elements in people, such as solidarity or the appeal of sharing in the creation of a new system.

Public education and press free from government control can be as much a tool for [[totalitarianism]] as they are a tool for democracy. They surround the citizens, who in a modern state do not have direct contact with the events that affect them, with "ready made intellectual goods", making them susceptible to propaganda.

===The American Background===
According to Dewey, the leaders of the American rebellion against the British were motivated by restrictions placed on industry and trade and by high taxation. This was rationalized into the idea that all government not self-imposed is foreign to human nature and human rights. This simple theory of democracy was a product of the simple conditions under which it was formulated: There is a widespread desire in human nature for personal freedom - release from dominion over personal beliefs and conduct. The main threat to freedom is the tendency of government officials to extend their power. Therefore, guarantees against abuse of government power are enough to guarantee freedom. This idea is very influential in the U.S.

A view that [[economic development]] is having an anti-democratic effect and should be controlled by government is more modern and its existence is an indication that conditions have changed dramatically. Conditions have become more complex, and impersonal forces have been set in motion on unprecedented scale, resulting in loss of personal control over the personal situation. Modern conditions have rendered the assumed harmony between liberty and equality invalid. Also, the tendency toward organization by both labor and capital, that is inherent in economic development, was seen in the original democratic theory as an anti-democratic force.

The loss of control motivates both the working class and the capitalists to embrace totalitarian means in the hope of improving security, and distrust of organized labor and capital pushes the public to give more power, as a counterbalance, to a would-be dictator. Can existing institutions be used to cope with modern problems? [[Socialist]]s who favor non-revolutionary means suggest regulation of industry or ownership of industry by government. Theory and practice, however, do not show that the resulting situation is essentially different from that of [[capitalism]], leaving the question of how to reconcile modern conditions with democracy open.

===Totalitarian Economics and Democracy===

This chapter is a critique of monistic [[Marxist theory]] in vogue at the time the book was written. Marxism asserts that social activities and relations are determined solely by economic conditions, rejecting other factors, associated with human behavior, as having any influence. Original Marxist qualification to this position, allowing that existing social structures can have influence on subsequent events, is removed.

Beyond [[economic determinism]], Marxism states that all social change is the result of [[Class conflict|class warfare]], which moves the workers toward liberation from past subjugation, and finally creates a classless society. This law is an economic paraphrase of the [[Hegelian dialectic]] idealism, in which conflict between ideas results in synthesis and harmony.

Marxist theory was a creature of its time, a time when intellectual thought was dealing with social development (or "evolution"), causal necessity, Hegelian philosophy, economically based ideologies and the search for social theories. Marxism is dated by its search for unifying causality, since while the idea of unifying causality was typical of mid 19th century science, it was abandoned in later scientific thought, to be replaced by the idea of invariance, which describes how different phenomena relate to each other, rather than ascribe a single cause for all phenomena.

"The inherent theoretical weakness of Marxism is that it supposed a generalization that was made at a particular date and place (and made even then only by bringing observed facts under a premise drawn from a metaphysical source) can {{sic|obviate|hide=y| the need}} for continued resort to observation, and to continual revision of generalizations in their office of working hypotheses."

Acceptance of Marxism was supported by its discussion of contemporary social phenomena - the struggle between capitalists and factory workers, and economic cycles and concentration. In both its structure and in its attraction based on addressing pressing social issues, Marxism is similar to a religious ideology.

In the [[USSR]], monistic Marxist theory has been accompanied by the anti-scientific devices of one party control of all communications and persecution of dissenters. Power has been given to a small group to apply the theory in specific cases, giving that group absolute coercive power derived from the absolute principle.

This occurrence demonstrates that popular representation, multiple parties and constant criticism of government encourage freedom. Despite the influence of economic factors in politics, these formal devices allow interplay of various tendencies whose result is greatly better than that of a monistic idea.

===Democracy and Human Nature===
"We cannot continue the idea that human nature when left to itself, when freed from external arbitrary restrictions, will tend to the production of democratic institutions that work successfully... We have to see that democracy means the belief that humanistic culture ''should'' prevail; we should be frank and open in our recognition that the proposition is a moral one- like any idea that concerns what ''should'' be."&lt;ref&gt;pg.97 of ''Freedom and Culture'', in the 1989 Prometheus Books edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Science and Free Culture===

"Science through its physical and technological consequences is now determining the relations between human beings. If it is incapable of developing moral techniques which will also determine these relations, the split in modern culture goes so deep that not only democracy but all civilized values are doomed. A culture that permits science to destroy traditional values but which distrusts its power to create new ones is a culture which is destroying itself."

'''Georges Canguilhem''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ɑː|ŋ|ɡ|ɪ|ˈ|l|ɛ|m}}; {{IPA-fr|kɑ̃ɡijɛm, kɑ̃ɡilɛm|lang}}; 4 June 1904 – 11 September 1995) was a [[France|French]] [[philosopher]] and [[physician]] who specialized in [[epistemology]] and the [[philosophy of science]] (in particular, [[philosophy of biology|biology]]).

==Life and work==
Canguilhem entered the [[École Normale Supérieure]] in 1924 as part of a class that included [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Raymond Aron]] and [[Paul Nizan]]. He [[agrégation|aggregated]] in 1927 and then taught in [[lycée]]s throughout France, taking up the study of medicine while teaching in [[Toulouse]].

He took up a post at the [[Clermont-Ferrand]] based [[University of Strasbourg]] in 1941, and received his medical doctorate in 1943, in the middle of [[World War II]]. Using the pseudonym "Lafont" Canguilhem became active in the [[French Resistance]], serving as a doctor in [[Auvergne (région)|Auvergne]].

By 1948 he was the French equivalent of department chair in philosophy at Strasbourg as well. Seven years later, he was named a professor at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] and succeeded [[Gaston Bachelard]] as the director of the Institut d'histoire des sciences, a post he occupied until 1971, at which time he undertook an active emeritus career.

In 1983 he was awarded the [[George Sarton Medal|Sarton Medal]] by the [[History of Science Society]]. In 1987 he received the ''médaille d'or'', awarded by the [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique]] (CNRS).

===Philosophy of biology===

Canguilhem's principal work in philosophy of science is presented in two books, ''Le Normal et le pathologique'', first published in 1943 and then expanded in 1968, and ''La Connaissance de la vie'' (1952). ''Le Normal et la pathologique'' is an extended exploration into the nature and meaning of normality in medicine and biology, the production and institutionalization of medical knowledge. It is still a seminal work in medical anthropology and the history of ideas, and is widely influential in part thanks to Canguilhem's influence on [[Michel Foucault]]. ''La Connaissance de la vie'' is an extended study of the specificity of biology as a science, the historical and conceptual significance of [[vitalism]], and the possibility of conceiving organisms not on the basis of mechanical and technical models that would reduce the organism to a machine, but rather on the basis of the organism's relation to the milieu in which it lives, its successful survival in this milieu, and its status as something greater than "the sum of its parts." Canguilhem argued strongly for these positions, criticising 18th and 19th century vitalism (and its politics) but also cautioning against the reduction of biology to a "physical science." He believed such a reduction deprived biology of a proper field of study, ideologically transforming living beings into mechanical structures serving a chemical/physical equilibrium that cannot account for the particularity of organisms or for the complexity of life. He furthered and altered these critiques in a later book, ''Ideology and Rationality in the History of the Life Sciences''.

Canguilhem was originally hostile to the ideas of [[Henri Bergson]] and vitalism but was later influenced by them and developed his own "idiosyncratic brand of vitalism."&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, Charles; Wong, Andy. (2014). [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1022.4150&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf ''The Return of Vitalism: Canguilhem, Bergson and the Project of Biophilosophy'']. In Miguel de Beistegui; Giuseppe Bianco; Marjorie Gracieuse. ''The Care of Life: Transdisciplinary Perspectives in Bioethics and Biopolitics''. Rowman &amp; Littlefield International. pp. 63-75. {{ISBN|978-1783480371}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More than just a great theoretician, Canguilhem was one of the few philosophers of the 20th century to develop an approach that was shaped by a medical education. He helped define a method of studying the [[history of science]] which was practical and rigorous. His work focused on the one hand on the concepts of "normal" and "pathological" and, on the other, a critical history of the formation of concepts such as "reflex" in the history of science. Canguilhem was also a mentor to several French scholars, most notably [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]], for whom he served as a sponsor in the presentation of ''Histoire de la folie à l'âge classique'' (''History of Madness'') for the ''Doctorat d'État'' and whose work he followed throughout the latter's life.

=== Institutional role ===
As Inspector General and then President of the Jury d'Agrégation in philosophy, Canguilhem had a tremendous and direct influence over philosophical instruction in France in the latter half of the twentieth century and was known to more than a generation of French academic philosophers as a demanding and exacting evaluator who, as [[Louis Althusser]] remarked, believed he could correct the philosophical understanding of teachers by bawling them out. This belief did not prevent him from being regarded with considerable affection by the generation of intellectuals that came to the fore in the 1960s, including [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Michel Foucault]], [[Louis Althusser]], and [[Jacques Lacan]]. Althusser once wrote to his English translator that "''my debt to Canguilhem is incalculable''" (italics in the original, from ''Economy and Society'' 27, page 171). Likewise, Foucault, in his introduction to Canguilhem's ''The Normal and the Pathological'', wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Take away Canguilhem and you will no longer understand much about Althusser, Althusserism and a whole series of discussions which have taken place among French Marxists; you will no longer grasp what is specific to sociologists such as [[Pierre Bourdieu|Bourdieu]], [[Robert Castel|Castel]], [[Jean-Claude Passeron|Passeron]] and what marks them so strongly within [[sociology]]; you will miss an entire aspect of the theoretical work done by [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalysts]], particularly by the followers of Lacan. Further, in the entire discussion of ideas which preceded or followed the [[May 1968 in France|movement of '68]], it is easy to find the place of those who, from near or from afar, had been trained by Canguilhem.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Derrida recalled that Canguilhem advised him early in his career that he would have to distinguish himself as a serious scholar before he could exhibit professionally the particular philosophical sense of humour for which he is at turns famous and notorious, advice which Derrida seemed to have taken in earnest.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

After years of neglect, a great deal of Canguilhem's writings have been translated into English. Among them are a collection of essays entitled ''A Vital Rationalist'' and his most celebrated work, ''The Normal and the Pathological''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="85818">'''Grade inflation''' is used in two senses: (1) grading leniency: the awarding of higher grades than students deserve, which yields a higher average grade given to students (2) the tendency to award progressively higher [[Grade (education)|academic grades]] for work that would have received lower grades in the past.

This article is about grade inflation in the second sense. Higher grades in themselves do not prove grade inflation and many believe there is no such problem. It is also necessary to demonstrate that the grades are not deserved.&lt;ref name="Arenson 2004"/&gt;

Grade inflation is frequently discussed in relation to [[education in the United States]], and to [[GCSEs]] and [[Advanced Level (UK)|A levels]] in [[England and Wales]]. It is also an issue in many other nations, such as [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[South Korea]] and [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==In the United States==
===At the post-secondary level===
Louis Goldman, professor at [[Wichita State University]], states that an increase of .404 points was reported from a survey in 134 colleges from 1965 to 1973. A second study in 180 colleges, showed a .432 GPA increase from 1960 to 1974, both indicating grade inflation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goldman|first1=Louis|title=The Betrayal of the Gatekeepers: Grade Inflation|journal=The Journal of General Education|date=1985|volume=37|issue=2|pages=97–121|jstor=27797025}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
[[Stuart Rojstaczer]], a retired [[geophysics]] professor at [[Duke University]], has collected historical data from over 400 four-year schools, in some cases dating back to the 1920s, showing evidence of nationwide grade inflation over time, and regular differences between classes of schools and departments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Harvey Mansfield]], a professor of government at Harvard University, argues that just denying the existence of grading inflation at Harvard proves that the problem is serious. He states that students are given easy grades by some professors to be popular, and these professors will be forgotten; only the ones challenging students will be remembered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Masfield|first1=Harvey|title=Grade Inflation: It's Time to Face the Facts|journal=The Chronicle of Higher Education|date=2001|volume=47|issue=30|pages=B24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Main historical trends identified include:
* a divergence in average grades between public and private institutions, starting in the 1950s;
* a widespread sharp rise in grades from the mid-1960s to mid-1970s ([[Vietnam War]] years);
* relatively little change in grades from the mid-1970s to mid-1980s;
* a slow rise in grades from the mid-1980s to present.
The average at private schools is currently 3.3, while at public schools it is 3.0. This difference is partly but not entirely attributed to differences in quality of student body, as measured by standardized test scores or selectivity. After correcting for these factors, private schools grade on average 0.1 or 0.2 points higher than comparable public schools, depending on which measure is used.

There is significant variation in grading between different schools, and across disciplines. Between classes of schools, engineering schools grade lower by an average of 0.15 points, while public flagship schools grade somewhat higher. Across disciplines, science departments grade on average 0.4 points below humanities and 0.2 points below social sciences. While engineering ''schools'' grade lower on average, engineering ''departments'' grade comparably to social sciences departments, about 0.2 points above science departments. These differences between disciplines have been present for at least 40 years, and sparse earlier data suggests that they date back 70 years or more.

Until recently, the evidence for grade inflation in the US has been sparse, largely anecdotal, and sometimes even contradictory; firm data on this issue was not abundant, nor was it easily attainable or amenable for analysis. National surveys in the 1990s generally showed rising grades at American colleges and universities,&lt;ref&gt;Levine and Cureton, 1998;  Kuh and Hu, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; but a survey of college transcripts by a senior research analyst in the [[U.S. Department of Education]] found that grades declined slightly in the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/nytimes/115860887.html?did=115860887&amp;FMT=ABS | title=Archives: The New York Times Article Archive: 1851–1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Data for American high schools were lacking.

Recent data leave little doubt that grades are rising at American colleges, universities and high schools. An evaluation of grading practices in US colleges and universities written in 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gradeinflation.com|title=National Trends in Grade Inflation, American Colleges and Universities|website=www.gradeinflation.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows that since the 1960s, grades in the US have risen at a rate of 0.15 per decade on a 4.0 scale. The study included over 80 institutions with a combined enrollment of over 1,000,000 students. An annual national survey of college freshmen&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050702082542/http://www.gseis.ucla.edu/heri/heri.html HIGHER EDUCATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE]&lt;/ref&gt; indicates that students are studying less in high school, yet an increasing number report high school grades of A− or better. Studies are being made in order to figure out who is more likely to inflate grades, and why an instructor would inflate a grade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=4c340cb5-e87c-4108-8f64-34824a002c6c%40sessionmgr112&amp;vid=1&amp;hid=101|title = Instructor-Specific Grade Inflation: Incentives, Gender, and Ethnicity|last = Jewell|first = Todd|date = March 2012|journal = Social Science Quarterly |access-date = November 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Princeton University====

In an attempt to combat the grade inflation prevalent at many top US institutions, Princeton began in the autumn of 2004 to employ guidelines for grading distributions across departments. Under the new guidelines, departments have been encouraged to re-evaluate and clarify their grading policies. The administration suggests that, averaged over the course of several years in an individual department, A-range grades should constitute 35% of grades in classroom work, and 55% of grades in independent work such as Senior Theses. These  guidelines are enforced by the academic departments. Since the policy's inception, A-range grades have declined significantly in Humanities departments, while remaining nearly constant in the Natural Science departments, which were typically at or near the 35% guideline already.&lt;ref name="Princeton2"&gt;{{Citation

In 2009, it was confirmed that the policy implemented in 2004 had brought undergraduate grades within the ranges targeted by the initiative. In 2008–09, A grades (A+, A, A−) accounted for 39.7% of grades in undergraduate courses across the University, the first time that A grades have fallen below 40% since the policy was approved. The results were in marked contrast to those from 2002–03, when As accounted for a high of 47.9% of all grades.&lt;ref name="Princeton"&gt;{{Citation

Deflation has varied by division, with the social sciences and natural sciences largely holding steady for the last four years. During that period, A grades have ranged from 37.1 to 37.9% in the social sciences and from 35.1 to 35.9% in the natural sciences.&lt;ref name="Princeton"/&gt; In the humanities and engineering, where deflation has been slower, 2008–09 brought significant movement. A's accounted for 42.5% of grades in the humanities last year and 40.6% of grades in engineering, both down two percentage points compared to 2007–08.&lt;ref name="Princeton"/&gt; In the period from fall 2006 through spring 2009, the most recent three-year period under the new grading policy, A's accounted for 40.1% of grades in undergraduate courses, down from 47.0% in 2001–04, the three years before the faculty adopted the policy. The 2006–09 results also mark continued deflation from those reported a year ago, when A's accounted for 40.4% of undergraduate grades in the 2005–08 period.&lt;ref name="Princeton"/&gt;  In humanities departments, A's accounted for 44.1% of the grades in undergraduate courses in 2006–09, down from 55.6% in 2001–04. In the social sciences, there were 37.7% A grades in 2006–09, down from 43.3% in 2001–04. In the natural sciences, there were 35.6% A grades in 2006–09, compared to 37.2% in 2001–04. In engineering, the figures were 41.7% A's in 2006–09, down from 50.2% in 2001–04.&lt;ref name="Princeton"/&gt;

====Harvard University====

Grade inflation is often equated with lax academic standards. For example, the following quote about lax standards from a [[Harvard University]] report in 1894 has been used to claim that grade inflation has been a longstanding issue: "Grades A and B are sometimes given too readily—Grade A for work of no very high merit, and Grade B for work not far above mediocrity. ... insincere students gain passable grades by sham work."&lt;ref&gt;("Report of the Committee on Raising the Standard")&lt;/ref&gt; Issues of standards in [[Education in the United States|American education]] have been longstanding. However, rising grades did not become a major issue in American education until the 1960s.  For example, in 1890 Harvard's average GPA was 2.27. In 1950, its average GPA was 2.55. By 2004, its GPA, as a result of dramatic rises in the 1960s and gradual rises since, had risen to 3.48.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Harvard graduate and professor [[Harvey Mansfield]] is a longtime vocal opponent of grade inflation at his alma mater. In 2013, Mansfield, after hearing from a dean that "the most frequent grade is an A", claimed to give students two grades: one for their transcript, and the one he thinks they deserve. He commented, "I didn’t want my students to be punished by being the only ones to suffer for getting an accurate grade".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Slavov| first =Sita| title =How to Fix College Grade Inflation: Inflated grades are a serious problem, but there are ways to fix them.| website =US News &amp; World Report| date =26 December 2013| url =https://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/economic-intelligence/2013/12/26/why-college-grade-inflation-is-a-real-problem-and-how-to-fix-it| accessdate = 11 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Nathaniel Stein published a satirical "leaked" grading rubric in ''[[The New York Times]]'', which included such grades as an A++ and A+++, or "A+ with garlands".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/15/opinion/sunday/leaked-harvards-grading-rubric.html?_r=2&amp;|title=Leaked!

"Because I have no access to the figures, I have to rely on what I saw and heard at the time. Although it is not so now, it was then utterly commonplace for white professors to overgrade black students. Any professor who did not overgrade black students either felt the impulse to do so or saw others doing it. From that, I inferred a motive for overgrading white students, too."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

====University of Alabama====

The [[University of Alabama]] has been cited as a recent case of grade inflation.  In 2003, Robert Witt, president of the university, responded to criticism that his administration encouraged grade inflation on campus by shutting down access to the records of the Office of Institutional Research, which, until that year, had made grade distribution data freely available. It is however, still available on the Greek Affairs website.  The Alabama Scholars Organization, and its newspaper, the ''Alabama Observer'', had been instrumental in exposing the situation and recommending that the Witt administration adopt public accountability measures.  The paper had revealed that several departments awarded more than 50 percent "A"s in introductory courses and that one department, Women's Studies, handed out 90 percent "A"s (the vast majority of those being "A+"){{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}.  Grades had grown consistently higher during the period examined, from 1973 to 2003.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

====UC campuses====

[[UC Berkeley]] has a reputation for rigorous grading policies. [[UC Berkeley College of Engineering]] departmental{{which|date=July 2018}} guidelines state that no more than 17% of the students in any given class may be awarded A grades, and that the class GPA should be in the range of 2.7 to 2.9 out of a maximum of 4.0 grade points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Policies/ugrad.grading.shtml|title=Grading Guidelines for Undergraduate Courses|first=Jan|last=Pardoe|date=14 June 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some departments, however, are not adhering to such strict guidelines, as data from the UCB's Office of Student Research indicates that the average overall undergraduate GPA was about 3.25 in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/userresearch/charts/2006_Fall_UCB_Undergraduate_Fact_Sheet.pdf |title=UC Berkeley Undergraduate Fact Sheet&amp;nbsp;– Fall 2006 |accessdate=2012-02-21 |deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608110312/http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/userresearch/charts/2006_Fall_UCB_Undergraduate_Fact_Sheet.pdf |archivedate=June 8, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other campuses have stricter grading policies. For example, the average undergraduate GPA of [[UC San Diego]] is 3.05, and fewer students have GPA &gt; 3.5 in science majors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://studentresearch.ucsd.edu/_files/publications/digest/Digest2011.pdf | title=STUDENT DIGEST 2011-2012 Enrollment and Academic Performance Statistics | publisher=UC San Diego Office of Student Research &amp; Information | date=Fall 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[UC Irvine]]'s average GPA is 3.01.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assessment.uci.edu/undergraduate/documents/UCIUndergraduate_Student_Data_and_Trends_F10.pdf|title=UCI Undergraduate Student Data Fall 2010|date=November 2010|publisher=UCI|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20120117203153/http://www.assessment.uci.edu/undergraduate/documents/UCIUndergraduate_Student_Data_and_Trends_F10.pdf|archivedate=2012-01-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Saint Anselm College====
A small liberal arts college in [[New Hampshire]], [[Saint Anselm College]] has received national attention and recognition for attempting to buck the trend of grade inflation seen on the campuses of many American colleges and universities. At Saint Anselm, the top 25% of the class has a 3.1 GPA; the median grade at the college is around a 2.50 GPA. Some professors and administrators believe that inflating grades makes it harder for students to realize their academic strengths and weaknesses and may encourage students to take classes based on grade expectation. The practice also makes it harder for parents and students to determine whether or not the grade was earned. Because of this, at Saint Anselm College, a curriculum committee was set up in 1980 to meet with the academic dean and review the grading policies on a monthly basis. This committee fights the practice of inflation by joining the administration and faculty in an effort to mend them into a working force against grade inflation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,209076,00.html |title=Grading: Is Honesty the Best Policy? |date=August 24, 2006 |author=Marianne Lebedinskaya |publisher=Fox News |accessdate=January 5, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091207093546/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0%2C2933%2C209076%2C00.html |archivedate=December 7, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The former president of the college, Father [[Jonathan DeFelice]], is quoted as saying, "I cannot speak for everyone, but if I'm headed for the operating room, I will take the surgeon who earned his or her "A" the honest way," in support of Saint Anselm's stringent grading system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anselm.edu/administration/president/op-eds/gradeinflation.htm |title=Higher Education Must Reverse Trend of Grade Inflation |author1=Fr.

====Pittsburgh School District====

A January 7, 2009 article in the ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'' used the term "grade inflation" to describe how some people viewed a grading policy in the [[Pittsburgh]] public school district. According to the article, the policy sets 50% as the minimum score that a student can get on any given school assignment. The article also stated that some students said they would rather get a score of 50% than do the school work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/09007/940011-53.stm Officials defend grade policy], Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, January 7, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
A March 2, 2009 follow-up article in the same newspaper said that the policy had been amended so that students who refuse to do the work will receive a grade of zero, and that the minimum grade of 50% will only apply to students who make a "good-faith effort".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/09061/952676-100.stm City schools amend '50 percent' grade policy], Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, March 2, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; A March 3, 2009, article in the same newspaper quoted Bill Hileman, a Pittsburgh Federation of Teachers staff representative, as saying, "The No. 1 problem with the 50 percent minimum was the negative impact on student behavior." The same article also said that the school district was planning to adopt a new grading scale in at least two schools by the end of the month. The article stated that under the original grading scale, the minimum scores required to earn an A, B, C, D, or F, were, respectively, 90%, 80%, 70%, 60%, and 0%. Under the new 5-point grading scale, the minimum scores required to earn an A, B, C, D, or F would be changed, respectively, to 4.0, 3.0, 2.0, 1.0, and 0.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/09062/952789-53.stm City schools flunk weighted grade system], Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, March 3, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ontario====

James Côté and Anton L. Allahar,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.utppublishing.com/Ivory-Tower-Blues-A-University-System-in-Crisis.html |title=IVORY TOWER BLUES: A UNIVERSITY SYSTEM IN CRISIS |access-date=2015-12-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170801200029/http://www.utppublishing.com/Ivory-Tower-Blues-A-University-System-in-Crisis.html |archive-date=2017-08-01 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; both professors of [[sociology]] at the [[University of Western Ontario]] conducted a rigorous empirical study of grade inflation in Canada, particularly of the province of [[Ontario]].  Up until the 1960s, grading in Ontario had been borne out of the British system, in which no more than 5% of students were given As, and 30% given Bs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ivorytowerblues.com/?page_id=16|title=Ivory Tower Blues|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080629012033/http://www.ivorytowerblues.com/?page_id=16|archivedate=2008-06-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1960s, average performers in Ontario were C-students, while A-students were considered exceptional.  As of 2007, 90% of Ontario students have a B average or above.&lt;ref name="Queens"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.queensjournal.ca/story/2008-09-19/features/making-the-grade/|title=Making the grade - The Journal|website=www.queensjournal.ca|author=Michael Wood|date=September 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Ontario, high school grades began to rise with the abolition of province-wide standardized exams in 1967.&lt;ref name="CoteAllahar"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Côté | first1 = James | last2 = Anton | first2 = Allahar | title = The Ivory Tower Blues | location = Toronto, ON | publisher = University of Toronto | page = 195,198 | year = 2007 | nopp = true | isbn = 978-0802091826}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The abolition of province-wide exams meant that student marks were entirely assigned by individual teachers.  In 1983, 38% of students registering in universities had an average that was higher than 80%. By 1992, this figure was 44%.&lt;ref name="CoteAllahar"/&gt;  According to the [[Council of Ontario Universities]], 52.6% of high school graduates applying to Ontario universities in 1995 had an A average.  In 2004, this figure had risen 61%.&lt;ref name="CoteAllahar"/&gt;   In 1995, 9.4 percent of high school graduates reported an A+ average.  In 2003, this figure had risen to a high of 14.9%.&lt;ref name="CoteAllahar"/&gt;    The average grade of university applicants was 80% in 1997, and this percentage has steadily increased each year since.&lt;ref name="CoteAllahar"/&gt;

In 2004, Quebec's [[McGill University]] admitted that students from Ontario were given a higher cutoff grade than students from other provinces, because of concerns about grade inflation originating from the fact that Ontario does not have standardized provincial testing as a key component of high school graduation requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fims.uwo.ca/newmedia2006/default.asp?id=424|title=When is an "A" not quite an "A"?

====Atlantic Canada====

In 2007, the Atlantic Institute for Market Studies released a report on grade inflation in Atlantic Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.aims.ca/library/Gradeinflationvfinal_cc.pdf | title=Setting them up to fail? Excellent school marks don’t necessarily lead to excellent exam marks | publisher=Atlantic Institute for Market Studies | date=May 3, 2007 | author=Robert Laurie | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024012644/http://www.aims.ca/library/Gradeinflationvfinal_cc.pdf | archivedate=2007-10-24 | deadurl=y }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mathematics scores in New Brunswick francophone high schools indicate that teacher-assigned marks are inflated in relation to marks achieved on provincial exams. It was found that the average school marks and the average provincial exam were discordant.  When looking at marks for school years 2001–2002 to 2003–2004, it was found that school marks in all 21 high schools were higher than the provincial exam marks. The provincial average for school marks is 73.7% while the average for provincial exams marks is 60.1% over the three years. School marks in all 21 high schools were higher than the provincial exam marks.&lt;ref name="Macleans"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macleans.ca/article.jsp?content=20070605_153207_13228|title=Are we setting up students to fail?

In the context of provincial exams and teacher assigned grades, grade inflation is defined as the difference between the teacher-assigned marks and the results on a provincial exam for that particular course. It was found that higher grade inflation points to lower provincial exam results. Of the 21 high schools, [[École Marie-Gaëtane]] had the highest grade inflation, at 24.7%. With a provincial exam average of 52.3% this school is also the least achieving school in the province.  In contrast, schools Polyvalente [[Louis-J-Robichaud]], Polyvalente [[Mathieu-Martin]], [[École Grande-Rivière]] and Polyvalente [[Roland-Pépin]] had the lowest grade inflation with values ranging from −0.7% to 9.3%.  They were the four top performing schools on the grade 11 mathematics provincial exams.&lt;ref name="Macleans"/&gt;  Similar results were found for Anglophone New Brunswick high schools, as well as for Newfoundland and Labrador schools. Despite the high marks assigned by teachers, Atlantic Canadian high school students have consistently ranked poorly in pan Canadian and international assessments.&lt;ref name="Macleans"/&gt;

====British Columbia====

In 2008, in British Columbia, the [[University of Victoria]] (UVic) and the [[University of British Columbia]] (UBC) reduced the number of Grade 12 provincial exams that high school students were required to write in order to gain admission to those universities. Prior to 2008, high school students applying to UVic and UBC were required to write 4 provincial exams, including Grade 12 English. In 2008, this standard was reduced so that students were only required to write the provincial exam for Grade 12 English.  A UVic administrator claimed that the rationale for this reduction in standards is that it allows the university to better compete with central Canadian universities (i.e. Ontario and Québec universities) for students, and prevent enrollment from falling.  Universities in central Canada do not require high school students to write provincial exams, and can offer early admission based on class marks alone. A Vancouver high school principal criticized the change in requirements by charging that it would become difficult to detect grade inflation. The president of the University Presidents' Council of British Columbia also criticized the move and said the provincial exams are "the great equalizer". The [[British Columbia Teachers Federation]] supported the change because in the past some students avoided certain subjects for fear that poor marks on provincial exams would bring down their average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/westcoastnews/story.html?id=e8acefaf-44d9-4de5-a9f2-3931557a580e|title=Universities prepare to lower standards|work=Vancouver Sun|publisher= CanWest MediaWorks Publications Inc|via=Canada.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107150633/http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/westcoastnews/story.html?id=e8acefaf-44d9-4de5-a9f2-3931557a580e|archivedate=2012-11-07|date=December 11, 2007|deadurl=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fall of 2009, [[Simon Fraser University]] (SFU) changed its requirements so that high school students only need to pass the English 12 provincial exam. Previously, students were required to pass 4 provincial exams, including English 12, in order to apply. This change brought SFU into line with UVic and UBC. Administrators claimed that this reduction of standards was necessary so that SFU could better compete with UBC and UVic for students. The change was criticized on the ground that it leads to "a race to the bottom".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-peak.ca/article/3844|title=Provincial exams no longer required entrance into SFU|author= Shara Lee, 2008|work=The Peak Publications Society|date=22 July 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Alberta====

As of 2007, 40% of Ontario high school graduates leave with A averages&amp;nbsp;– 8 times as many as would be awarded in the traditional British system.&lt;ref name="CoteAllahar"/&gt; In Alberta, as of 2007, just over 20% of high school graduates leave with an A average.&lt;ref name="CoteAllahar"/&gt; This discrepancy may be explained that all Alberta high school students must write province-wide standardized exams, Diploma exams, in core subjects, in order to graduate.

The Alberta Diploma exams are given in grade 12, covering core subjects such as biology, chemistry, English, math, physics and social studies. The exams are worth 30 percent of a grade 12 student's final mark.  Quebec also requires its students to write Diploma Exams for graduating students. Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and Nova Scotia have similar tests. British Columbia has a mandatory English proficiency test in grade 12, provincial tests in other subjects are optional.&lt;ref name="Queens"/&gt;

Alberta's focus on standardized exams keeps grade inflation in check, but can put Albertan high school students at a disadvantage relative to students in other provinces. However, Alberta has the highest standards in Canada and produces students who are among the best in international comparisons.&lt;ref name="CoteAllahar"/&gt;  By preventing grade inflation, Albertan high schools have been able to greatly ameliorate the problem of compressing students with different abilities into the same category (i.e. inflating grades so that a student in the 98th percentile, for example, cannot be distinguished from one in the 82nd percentile).&lt;ref name="CoteAllahar"/&gt;

===At the post-secondary level===

In relation to grade inflation at the university level, the research of the aforementioned Professors Côté and Allahar concluded that: "We find significant evidence of grade inflation in Canadian universities in both historical and comparative terms, as well as evidence that it is continuing beyond those levels at some universities so as to be comparable with levels found in some American universities.  It is also apparent that the inflated grades at Canadian universities are now taken for granted as normal, or as non-inflated, by many people, including professors who never knew the traditional system, have forgotten it, or are in denial".&lt;ref name="CoteAllahar"/&gt;

A 2000 study of grade patterns over 20 years at seven Ontario universities (Brock, Guelph, McMaster, Ottawa, Trent, Wilfrid Laurier and Windsor) found that grade point averages rose in 11 of 12 arts and sciences courses between 1973–74 and 1993–94. In addition, it was found that a higher percentage of students received As and Bs and fewer got Cs, Ds and Fs.&lt;ref name="DGirard"&gt;{{Citation

A 2006 study by the Canadian Undergraduate Survey Consortium released earlier in 2007 found students at the [[University of Toronto Scarborough]] got lower marks on average than their counterparts at [[Carleton University|Carleton]] and [[Ryerson University|Ryerson]]. Marking, not ability, was determined to be the reason.&lt;ref name="DGirard"/&gt;

====University of Waterloo====

In 2009 a presentation by Greg Mayer on ''Grade Inflation at the [[University of Waterloo]]'' reported that grade inflation was occurring there. The study initially stated that there was "no consensus on how Grade Inflation is defined ...

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
From 1988/89 to 2006/07 it was determined that there had been an 11.02% increase in undergraduate A grades, with the rate of increase being 0.656% per year.&lt;ref name="GMayer"/&gt;
In 100 level Math for the year 2006/07, the grade distribution of 11,042 assigned grades was: 31.9% A, 22.0% B, 18%C, 16.3% D, 11.8% F.  In 400 level Fine Arts courses for 2006/07, the distribution of 50 assigned grades was: 100% A.&lt;ref name="GMayer"/&gt;
In relation to increased scores in first-year mathematics, there was no evidence of better preparedness of UW students.  A possible source of grade inflation may have been pressure from administrators to raise grades.  A case was documented in which a math dean adjusted grades without the consent or authorization of the instructor.&lt;ref name="GMayer"/&gt;

When comparing the 1988–1993 school years with that of the years from 2002–2007, it was discovered that the percentage of As assigned in 400 levels in the Faculty of Arts had risen as follows for every department (first figure is percentage of As for 1988–1993 years, second is percentage of As for 2002–2007 years): Music 65%/93%, Fine Art 51%/84%,  Sociology 54%/73%, History 66%/71%, Philosophy 63%/69%, Anthropology 63%/68%, Drama 39%/63%, Political Science 46%/57%, English 43%/57%, French 39%/56%, Economics 36%/51%, Business 28%/47%, Psychology 80%/81%.&lt;ref name="GMayer"/&gt;  It is important to note that this study examined only 400-level courses and conclusions regarding grade inflation should not be generalized to courses at other levels.

==In the United Kingdom==
Annual grade inflation has been a continuing feature of the UK public examination system for several decades. In April 2012 Glenys Stacey, the chief executive of Ofqual, the UK public examinations regulator, acknowledged its presence and announced a series of measures to restrict further grade devaluation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/secondaryeducation/9233517/A-level-overhaul-to-halt-rampant-grade-inflation.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Julie | last=Henry | title=A-level overhaul to halt "rampant grade inflation" | date=28 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2138340/Ofqual-grade-inflation-Everyone-knows-exams-got-easier-decade-The-surprise-educational-establishment-admitted-it.html|title=Everyone knows exams have got easier over the last decade.

===GCSE===
Since the turn of the millennium the percentage of pupils obtaining 5 or more good [[GCSEs]] has increased by about 30%, while independent tests performed as part of the OECD [[PISA]] and IES [[TIMSS]] studies have reported Literacy, Maths and Science scores in England and Wales having fallen by about 6%, based on their own tests&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ioe.ac.uk/Study_Departments/J_Jerrim_qsswp1109.pdf | title=England's plummeting PISA test scores between 2000 and 2009: Is the performance of our secondary school pupils really in relative decline? | first=John | last=Jerrim | publisher=Institute of Education, University of London | date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2009 and June 2012, ''The Daily Mail''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1211345/Maths-skills-standing-thirty-years-GCSE-grades-soaring.html | title=The test that PROVES maths skills are standing still after thirty years | first=Laura | last=Black | website=[[Mail Online]] | date=5 September 2009 | publisher=Associated Newspapers}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Telegraph''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/9344505/Teenagers-worse-at-maths-than-in-1970s-figures-show.html | title=Teenagers 'worse at maths than in 1970s', figures show | first=Graeme | last=Paton | date=21 June 2012 | work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; respectively reported that teenagers' maths skills are no better than 30 years ago, despite soaring GCSE passes. The articles are based on a 2009 paper by Jeremy Hodgen, of [[King's College London]], who compared the results of 3,000 fourteen-year-olds sitting a mathematics paper containing questions identical to one set in 1976. He found similar overall levels of attainment between the two cohorts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://fullfact.org/factchecks/maths_GCSE_standards_schools_pupils-27460 | website=Full Fact | title=Are today's pupils worse at maths than those of the 1970s? | date=22 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The articles suggest rising GCSE scores owe more to '[[teaching to the test]]' and grade inflation than to real gains in mathematical understanding.

Between 1975, with the introduction of the national alphabetic grades to the [[GCE Ordinary Level (United Kingdom)|O-Level]], and the replacement of both the O-Level and [[Certificate of Secondary Education|CSE]] with the GCSE, in 1988, approximately 36% of pupils entered for a Mathematics exam sat the O-Level and 64% the CSE paper. With grades allocated on a normative basis with approximately ~53% (10% A, 15% B, 25–30% C) obtaining a C or above at O-Level, and 10% the O-Level C equivalent Grade 1 CSE; a proportion being entered for neither paper. The percentage of the population obtaining at least a grade "C" or equivalent in maths, at O-level, remained fixed in 22–26% band.

Note: Historically an:
* O Level '''A-C''' grade was awarded to the top ~50–58% of each O-Level cohort, comprising the top ~28% of 16-year-olds&lt;ref name=times1&gt;{{cite news|last1=Geddes|first1=Diana|title=From borderline to pass, how O level papers are marked|url=http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&amp;source=gale&amp;prodId=TTDA&amp;userGroupName=norlib&amp;tabID=T003&amp;docPage=article&amp;searchType=AdvancedSearchForm&amp;docId=CS168001808&amp;type=multipage&amp;contentSet=LTO&amp;version=1.0|accessdate=12 September 2015|work=The Times|agency=Times [London, England]|issue=60319|publisher=Times [London, England]|date=1977-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* CSE Grade 1 was awarded to the top ~10% of each CSE cohort, comprising the next ~50–55% of 16-year-olds, in common subjects.
* CSE Grade 4 was awarded to candidates of average / median ability.&lt;ref name=times3&gt;{{cite news|last1=Geddes|first1=Diana|title=Poor marks for maths teaching|url=http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&amp;source=gale&amp;prodId=TTDA&amp;userGroupName=norlib&amp;tabID=T003&amp;docPage=article&amp;searchType=AdvancedSearchForm&amp;docId=CS51087931&amp;type=multipage&amp;contentSet=LTO&amp;version=1.0|accessdate=12 September 2015|work=The Times (London, England)|agency=The Times (London, England)|issue=61142|publisher=The Times (London, England)|date=1982-01-27|ref=p3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the replacement of the previous exams with the GCSE and a move from a normative to a criterion referencing grade system, reliant on examiner judgement, the percentage obtaining at least a grade '''C''', in mathematics, has risen to 58.4%, in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1539138/Tables-expose-truth-of-grade-inflation.html | title=Tables Expose Truth of Grade inflation | work=The Telegraph | date=12 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23636375-gcse-where-18-was-enough-to-get-grade-c.do | title=GCSE where 18% was enough to get grade C | first=Tim | last=Ross | work=[[Evening Standard]] | date=6 February 2009 | access-date=2009-10-10 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091125063933/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23636375-gcse-where-18-was-enough-to-get-grade-c.do | archive-date=2009-11-25 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.esri.mmu.ac.uk/respapers/papers-pdf/Professorial%20Lecture.pdf  | first=Harry | last=Torrance | publisher=[[Manchester Metropolitan University]] | date=11 June 2002 | title=Can Testing Really Raise Educational Standards?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An analysis of the GCSE awards to pupils achieving the average YELLIS ability test score of 45, between 1996–2006, identified a general increase in awards over the 10 years, ranging from 0.2 (Science) to 0.8 (Maths) of a GCSE grade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cem.org/attachments/ONS%20report%20on%20changes%20at%20GCSE%20and%20A-level.pdf | first=Robert | last=Coe | title=Changes in Standards at GCSE and A-Level: Evidence from ALIS and YELLIS | date=April 2007 | publisher=Centre for Evaluation and Monitoring | page=4 | accessdate=29 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been suggested that the incorporation of GCSE awards into school league tables, and the setting of School level targets, at above national average levels of attainment, may be a driver of GCSE grade inflation. At the time of introduction the '''E''' grade was intended to equivalent to the CSE grade 4,&lt;ref name=times3 /&gt; and so obtainable by a candidate of average/median ability; Sir Keith Joseph set Schools a target to have 90% of their pupil obtain a minimum of a grade F (which was the 'average' grade achieved in 1988), the target was achieved nationally in summer of 2005. David Blunkett went further and set schools the goal of ensuring 50% of 16-year olds gained 5 GCSEs or equivalent at grade C and above, requiring schools to device a means for 50% of their pupils to achieve the grades previously only obtained by the top 30%, this was achieved by the summer of 2004 with the help of equivalent and largely vocational qualifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sheldon|first1=N|title=History examinations from the 1960s to the present day|url=http://www.history.ac.uk/history-in-education/sites/history-in-education/files/attachments/history_examinations_from_the_1960s_to_the_present_day.doc|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131126122506/http://www.history.ac.uk/history-in-education/sites/history-in-education/files/attachments/history_examinations_from_the_1960s_to_the_present_day.doc|dead-url=no|archive-date=26 November 2013|website=history.ac.uk|publisher=history.ac.uk|accessdate=13 September 2015|ref=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Labelling Schools failing if they are unable to achieve at least 5 Cs, including English and Maths at GCSE, for 40% of their pupils has also been criticised, as it essentially requires 40% of each intake to achieve the grades only obtained by the top 20% at the time of the qualifications introduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Richardson|first1=Hannah|last2=Sellgren|first2=Katherine|title=School league tables branded a 'nonsense' amid changes|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-31023685|website=BBC News|publisher=BBC|accessdate=13 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Malnick|first1=Edward|title=GCSE performance tables: Number of failing schools doubles in a year|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/11375644/GCSE-performance-tables-Number-of-failing-schools-doubles-in-a-year.html|website=The Telegraph|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=13 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of reports have also suggested the licensing of competing commercial entities to award GCSEs may be contributing to the increasing pass rates, with schools that aggressively switch providers appearing to obtain an advantage in exam pass rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GCSEs - in need of reform? | url=http://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/6298 | date=22 August 2012 | publisher=[[Institute for Fiscal Studies]] | accessdate=23 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1=Niall | first1=Oddy | title=When competition is bad | url=http://www.atthegrapevine.com/politics/when-competition-is-bad | website=At The Grapevine | date=13 September 2012 | accessdate=23 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Exam boards competing on standards? | url=http://www.cmre.org.uk/node/29 |publisher=The Centre for the Study of Market Reform of Education | accessdate=23 August 2015 | first=James | last=Croft | date=17 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=School examiners filmed 'cheating' to boost grades | url=http://theday.co.uk/politics/school-examiners-filmed-cheating-to-boost-grades | website=The Day | date=9 December 2011 | accessdate=24 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to allegations of grade inflation, a number of schools have switched to other exams, such as the International GCSE, or the International Baccalaureate middle years programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tom-brown.com/articles/independent-schools-top-gcse-tables | title=Independent schools top GCSE tables | date=28 August 2009 | website=tom-brown.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Advanced Level (UK)|A-level]]===
Between 1963 and 1986 A-Level grades were awarded according to [[Norm-referenced test|norm-referenced]] percentile quotas (A &lt;= 10%, B = 15%, C = 10%, D = 15%, E = 20%, O/N = 20%, F/U &gt;= 10% of candidates). The validity of this system was questioned in the early 1980s because, rather than reflecting a standard, norm referencing might have simply maintained a specific proportion of candidates at each grade. In small cohorts this could lead to grades which only indicated a candidate's relative performance against others sitting that particular paper, and so not be comparable between cohorts (e.g., if one year, only 11 candidates were entered for A-Level English nationally, and the next year only 12, this would raise doubt whether the single '''A''' awarded in year one was equivalent to the single '''A''' awarded in year two). In 1984 the Secondary Examinations Council decided to replace the norm referencing with criteria referencing, wherein grades would be awarded on "examiner judgement".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=THE BACKGROUND TO THE A LEVELS DEBATE|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmselect/cmeduski/153/15304.htm|website=UK Parliament|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The criteria referencing scheme came into effect in June 1987, and since its introduction examiner judgment, along with the merger of the '''E''' and '''O/N''' grades and a change to a resitable modular format from June 2002, has increased the percentage of '''A''' grade awards from 10 to &gt;25%, and the '''A-E''' awards from 70 to &gt;98%.

In 2007 Robert Coe, of Durham University, published a report analysing the historic A-Level awards to candidates who'd obtained the average norm-referenced ALIS TDA/ITDA test scores, he noted:
{{quotation| From 1988 until 2006 the achievement levels have risen by about an average of 2 grades in each subject. Exceptionally, from 1988 the rise appears to be about 3.5 grades for Mathematics.}}
This suggests that a candidate rejected with a '''U''' classification in mathematics in 1988 would likely be awarded a '''B/C''' grade in 2012, while in all subjects a 1980s '''C''' candidate would now be awarded an '''A*/A'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Coe|first1=Robert|title=Changes in standards at GCSE and ALevel:  Evidence from ALIS and YELLIS|url=http://www.cem.org/attachments/ONS%20report%20on%20changes%20at%20GCSE%20and%20A-level.pdf|website=cem.org|publisher=CEM Centre, Durham University|accessdate=24 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/6063012/A-level-results-grade-inflation-is-just-a-cruel-confidence-trick.html|title=A-level results: grade inflation is just a cruel confidence trick|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The OECD noted in 2012, that the same competing commercial entities are licensed to award A-Levels as GCSEs (see above).

An educationalist at Buckingham University thinks grades inflate when examiners check scripts that lie on boundaries between grades.{{clarify|date=March 2014}} Every year some are pushed up but virtually none down, resulting in a subtle year-on-year shift.&lt;ref name="economist"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buckingham.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/AL2011.pdf|title=A-Levels 2011, by Alan Smithers|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Higher education===
The [[Higher Education Statistics Agency]] gathers and publishes annual statistics relating to the higher qualifications awarded in the UK. The Students and Qualifiers data sets indicate that the percentage of "GOOD" first degree classifications have increased annually since 1995. For example, 7% of all first-degree students who graduated in the academic year 1995/96 achieved first class honours; by 2008/09 this had risen to 14%.&lt;ref name="dailymailarticlefirstclassdegrees"&gt;{{cite news

Between 1995 and 2011, the proportion of upper second class honours awarded for first degree courses increased from 40.42% to 48.38%, whilst lower second class honours dropped from 34.97% to 28.9%. The number of third class honours, "ordinary" (i.e. pass), and unclassified awards dropped substantially during the same period.
During this time, the total number of first degrees awarded in the UK increased by 56%, from 212,000 to 331,000.&lt;ref name="HESAfreeonlinedatatables" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stopgradeinflation.ie/Grade_Inflation_in_the_University_Sector.pdf|title=Grade Inflation in Irish Universities (1994 – 2004) by Martin O’Grady and Brendan Guilfoyle|publisher=|access-date=2012-09-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130810065209/http://www.stopgradeinflation.ie/Grade_Inflation_in_the_University_Sector.pdf|archive-date=2013-08-10|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grade inflation in UK universities appears to be caused by administrators wishing to improve their league table standings, a desire to attract non-European students who can be charged full fees, academics who fear receiving unfavourable [[course evaluation]]s from students, the breakdown of the external examiner system, and a growing indifference towards academic dishonesty and plagiarism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last =Alderman| first =Geoffrey| title =Why university standards have fallen| newspaper =The Guardian| date =10 March 2010| url =https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/mar/10/universities-standards-blair-target| accessdate = 22 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Note''': The [[New universities|doubling of institutions]] and quadrupling of student numbers, following the [[Further and Higher Education Act 1992]], makes any direct comparison of pre and post 1995 awards non trivial, if not meaningless.

==In India==
In [[Central Board of Secondary Education|CBSE]], a 95 per cent aggregate is 21 times as prevalent today as it was in 2004, and a 90 per cent close to nine times as prevalent. In the [[Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations|ISC Board]], a 95 per cent is almost twice as prevalent today as it was in 2012.  CBSE called a meeting of all 40 school boards early in 2017 to urge them to discontinue “artificial spiking of marks”. CBSE decided to lead by example and promised not to inflate its results. But although the 2017 results have seen a small correction, the board has clearly not discarded the practice completely. Almost 6.5 per cent of mathematics examinees in 2017 scored 95 or more — 10 times higher than in 2004 — and almost 6 per cent of physics examinees scored 95 or more, 35 times more than in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

*It is not uniform among disciplines.
*It makes it more difficult to compare students who took their exams at different times.
*Prospective employers must rely on indicators other than grades, such as [[internship]]s and [[work experience]], in order to gauge a graduate's [[Skill|skill level]] and [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Arguments against taking action on grade inflation===
*Higher grades at some schools may reflect better performance than others (although with no national standard, there can be no way to compare one school to another by grades).
*Although grade inflation does not evenly distribute through departments, it is arguable due to the subjective nature of grades, that interdepartmental grading practices were not equal in the first place (e.g. how is one supposed to determine the equivalent grade for an English course to an ''A'' grade in Physics?)
*It can motivate students of average ability to invest in an academic degree, instead of learning a [[skilled trade]] at a [[vocational school]].
*The US system still allows the brightest students to excel by offering courses with [[Honors student|honors options]] as well as awarding [[valedictorian]]s.

===Arguments against its existence===
*In 1995, Clifford Adelman, a senior research analyst for the U.S. Department of Education, reviewed student transcripts from more than 3,000 universities and reported that student grades had actually declined slightly over the prior 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ericdigests.org/2005-1/grade.htm|title=Grade Inflation in Higher Education|publisher= ERIC Digest}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A report issued by the National Center for Education Statistics surveyed all 16.5 million undergraduate students in the USA in the year 1999–2000. The study concluded that 28.9% of graduates received mostly ''C'' grades or lower, while only 14.5% received mostly ''A'' grades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2002/2002168.PDF|title=Profile of Undergraduates in U.S. Postsecondary Institutions: 1999–2000|publisher=U.S. Department of Education. National Center for Education Statistics|date=July 2002|author=Laura Horn|author2=Katharin Peter|author3=Kathryn Rooney|author4=Andrew G. Malizio|location=Washington, DC}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 2004, [[Alfie Kohn]] argued that "it has never been shown ... that those higher grades are undeserved".&lt;ref name="Arenson 2004"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/18/weekinreview/is-it-grade-inflation-or-are-students-just-smarter.html|title=Is It Grade Inflation, or Are Students Just Smarter?|first=|date=18 April 2004|website=|publisher=|newspaper=The New York Times|author=Arenson, Karen W.|accessdate=6 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ratings inflation==
Grade inflation is a specific instance of a broader phenomena of ratings or reputation inflation where rating decisions are made by individuals.  This has been occurring in peer-to-peer services such as [[Uber]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Griswold|first1=Alison|title=Good luck leaving your Uber driver less than five stars|url=https://qz.com/1244155/good-luck-leaving-your-uber-driver-less-than-five-stars/|accessdate=5 April 2018|work=[[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]]|date=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Graduate Management Admission Council''' ('''GMAC''') is an international non-profit organization of business schools that provides products and services to academic institutions and prospective graduate management education students. The organization owns the [[Graduate Management Admission Test]] (GMAT), a standardized assessment that is widely used by graduate [[business studies|business administration]] programs (e.g. [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]], [[Master of Accountancy]], Master of Finance, Master of Science in Business/Management, etc.) to measure quantitative, verbal, analytical and integrated reasoning skills in applicants. GMAC also provides survey research and market analysis aimed at helping graduate management admissions professionals make informed decisions, and serves as an information source for journalists and members of the public interested in information about management education and the role it plays in the global economy.

GMAC is based in [[Reston, Virginia]]. In 2007, the organization opened an office in [[London]], its first international location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmac.com/gmac/newsandevents/pressroom/pressreleases/lbsofficialtoleadeuropeanoperationsofgmac.htm |title=London Business School Official to Lead European Operations of Graduate Management Education Group |accessdate=17 June 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080402102134/http://www.gmac.com/gmac/newsandevents/pressroom/pressreleases/lbsofficialtoleadeuropeanoperationsofgmac.htm |archivedate=2 April 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; GMAC also has offices based in [[Hong Kong]] and [[Gurgaon, India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= https://www.gmac.com/service/contact-us.aspx | title= GMAC Contact us and Locations| accessdate=9 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Graduate Management Admission Council has 212 member schools from 22 countries, including Australia, Canada, China, France, Great Britain, India and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.gmac.com/why-gmac/the-gmac-advantage/gmac-history-timeline.aspx| title= GMAC History | accessdate=9 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the organization embarked on an effort to increase its membership outside North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Graduate Management Admission Council Introduces New Global Executive Team | accessdate=17 June 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080402103824/http://www.gmac.com/gmac/newsandevents/pressroom/pressreleases/gmacintroducesnewglobalexecutiveteam.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2 April 2008|url= http://www.gmac.com/gmac/newsandevents/pressroom/pressreleases/gmacintroducesnewglobalexecutiveteam.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; GMAC is governed by a 15-member board of directors that includes representation from business schools and private industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.gmac.com/about-us/board-of-directors.aspx| title=Board of Directors | accessdate=9 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7958">'''Green Schools Alliance''' ('''GSA''') is an effort by primary and secondary schools worldwide to address [[climate change]] and [[Conservation (ethic)|conservation]] challenges by creating a [[peer-to-peer]] network of member schools committed to reducing their [[greenhouse gas]] emissions and accelerating the implementation of sustainable solutions.

GSA member schools share and implement [[sustainability]] [[best practices]] and promote connections between schools, communities, and the environments that sustain them. GSA does this by creating peer-to-peer forums, exchanging resources, offering original programs and [[curriculum]], and connecting youth to nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mounce Stancil|first1=Joanna|title=Student Climate and Conservation Congress: Bright Young Minds|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/blogs/student-climate-and-conservation-congress-bright-young-minds|website=U.S.Forest Service|accessdate=August 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sustainability coordinators that participate in the network are composed of faculty, staff, students, administrators, and other school decision makers.

==History==
The GSA was formed in October 2007 as a result of [[Mayor of New York City]] [[Michael Bloomberg]]’s [[PlaNYC]] and related challenge to all NYC facilities to reduce carbon emissions by 30% by 2050, with support from the NYC Mayor's Office of Long-Term Planning and Sustainability, [[New York State Energy Research and Development Authority]] (NYSERDA), [[Clinton Foundation|Clinton Climate Initiative]] (CCI), [[Consolidated Edison]], [[National Association of Independent Schools]] (NAIS) and National Business Officers Association (NBOA).

The Allen-Stevenson School in NYC hosted the first GSA planning session that convened schools to address [[climate change]] and "what schools can do about it", and review the GSA Commitment. With additional guidance from the [[American College &amp; University Presidents' Climate Commitment]] (ACUPCC), Second Nature and AASHE, the GSA primary and secondary school climate dommitment was further refined. In November 2007, with a signatory group of 40 schools, the GSA was launched to the public at the [[US Green Building Council]] annual GreenBuild Conference when President [[Bill Clinton]] highlighted the GSA in his keynote speech. It is currently listed as one of the organizations committed to the Climate Education and Literacy Initiative launched by the White House [[Office of Science and Technology Policy]] (OSTP)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bidwell|first=Allie|title=Obama Wants Kids to Learn About Global Warming.Read more: The administration wants students and teachers to toe the line on climate change|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/12/03/obama-administration-to-launch-global-warming-education-initiative/|newspaper=U.S. News &amp; World Report|accessdate=3 December 2014|date=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These districts will build and share best practices, leverage their combined purchasing power to increase access to sustainable alternatives, promote market transformation, and influence policy decisions. Charter members of the District Collaborative affect the lives of 3.6 million children in 5,726 schools with more than 550 million square feet of building area.
{{ad|date=July 2018}}
Membership to the GSA's online community is free. Schools and districts can also pledge the Sustainability Leadership where princials, heads of school, and superintendents pledge to take action in these areas: Reduce Our Climate &amp; Ecological Impact,  Educate &amp; Engage Our Community, and Transform Our Culture.

==Programs==
GSA programs integrate education and action and aggregate and quantify progress. Using the building and campus as a teaching tool, students work alongside faculty and staff on projects from recycling, [[weatherization|weatherizing]], conducting energy audits, changing lights and replacing old boilers to improving science and technology education, restoring wetlands and planting green roofs. Best practices ripple outward from schools to families, to the workplace. GSA programs include:

The '''International Charter of Physical Education, Physical Activity and Sport'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002354/235409e.pdf |title= International Charter of Physical Education, Physical Activity and Sport | date=18 November 2015 |accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[rights-based]] document which was adopted by member states of the [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO), on November 18, 2015 during the 38th session of the UNESCO General Conference. This document is the legitimate successor of the '''International Charter of Physical Education and Sport''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13150&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |title=International Charter of Physical Education and Sport | date=21 November 1978 |accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  originally adopted in 1978, during the 20th General Conference of UNESCO.

The original Charter, which was amended in 1991, was the first rights-based document to state that '''“the practice of physical education and sport is a fundamental right for all”'''.
Based on the universal spirit of the original Charter (1978), and integrating the significant evolutions in the field of sport over the last 37 years, the revised Sport Charter highlights the health benefits of physical activity, the inclusion of persons with disabilities, the protection of children, the role of sport for development and peace, as well as the need to protect the integrity of sport from doping, violence, manipulation and corruption.

== Objectives ==

In twelve brief articles, the revised Charter serves as a universal reference on the ethical and quality standards of physical education, physical activity and sport. While preserving the initial intention of the 1978 Charter, this new document also represents a renewed commitment of the international sports community to actively promote sport as a catalyst for peace and development.

The revised version of the Sport Charter provides a framework that orients the protection of the integrity of sport and supports broader policies in favour of grassroots sport. It also recognizes physical education as a driver for promoting gender equality, social inclusion, non-discrimination and sustained dialogue in our societies.

UNESCO Director-General, [[Irina Bokova]] said: “The adoption of the revised Charter should mark a shift away from words towards action, from policy intent to implementation. It sets the tone for a new international sport policy debate, which should now focus on the exchange of good practice, education and training programmes, capacity development, and advocacy. This is also a strong recognition of physical education as a driver for promoting gender equality, social inclusion, non-discrimination and sustained dialogue in our societies.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.unesco.org/new/en/media-services/single-view/news/international_charter_of_physical_education_revised_to_ensure_more_inclusive_access_to_physical_activity/#.VlL51tHlvs0 |title= Press release issued by UNESCO to announce the adoption of the Sport Charter | date=18 November 2015 |accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contents ==

The [[Quality Physical Education Policy Project]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.unesco.org/new/en/social-and-human-sciences/themes/physical-education-and-sport/policy-project/ |title= Quality Physical Education Policy Project |accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; illustrates how principles and recommendations stipulated in the Charter can be translated into indicators, benchmarks and tools.

== Authors of the Revision ==
The revision of the Charter involved experts and practitioners from governments, sports organizations, academia and NGOs. This new version was carefully examined through sessions of the '''Intergovernmental Committee for Physical Education and Sport (CIGEPS)''' and its '''Permanent Consultative Council (PCC'''), as well as UNESCO’s '''Executive Board'''. It is a follow-up to the '''Declaration of Berlin'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/social-and-human-sciences/themes/physical-education-and-sport/mineps-2013/declaration/|title= Declaration of Berlin| date=30 May 2013 |accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; that was adopted by 600 participants from 121 countries, as an outcome of the '''5th World Conference of Sport Ministers (MINEPS V)'''.

=== MINEPS ===
Created in 1976, the [[International Conference of Ministers and Senior Officials Responsible for Physical Education and Sport]] (MINEPS) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/social-and-human-sciences/themes/physical-education-and-sport/mineps/ |title=The International Conference of Ministers and Senior Officials Responsible for Physical Education and Sport (MINEPS) |accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a forum that facilitates intellectual and technical exchange in the field of physical education and sport. MINEPS also serves as an institutional mechanism for a coherent international strategy in this domain.
It is also the only global platform that engages governments, intergovernmental organizations, the sport movement, academia and specialized NGOs.

=== CIGEPS ===
The [[Intergovernmental Committee for Physical Education and Sport]] (CIGEPS) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.unesco.org/new/en/social-and-human-sciences/themes/physical-education-and-sport/cigeps/ |title= The Intergovernmental Committee for Physical Education and Sport (CIGEPS) |accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; was established in 1978 to promote the role and value of sport and its inclusion in public policy. CIGEPS is composed of expert representatives in the field of physical education and sport from 18 UNESCO Member States, each elected for a four-year term.

The '''Irish Georgian Society''' aims to encourage an interest in and to promote the conservation of distinguished examples of architecture and the allied arts of all periods in Ireland. These aims are achieved by education and grants, planning participation, membership and fundraising.

==Achievements==

Notable achievements of the Irish Georgian Society include, among others, the saving of threatened great buildings such as [[Castletown House]], County Kildare; [[Roscrea Castle|Damer House]], County Tipperary; Doneraile Court, County Cork; Roundwood, Co. Laois; Tailors’ Hall, Dublin and 13 Henrietta Street, Dublin. 

Recent projects include the restoration of mid-eighteenth century panelled rooms at Ledwithstown, County Longford; the repair of the early nineteenth-century south tower roof at Barmeath Castle, Co. Louth; the restoration of the pavilion cupolas of Kilshannig, Co. Cork, built in the 1760s to the designs of the Italian architect [[Davis Ducart]]; and, in association with the Department of the Environment, Heritage &amp; Local Government, the World Monuments Fund and the Headfort Trust, the restoration of the superb Robert Adam decorative schemes at Headfort, County Meath. 

These conservation efforts are funded by the members’ participation in the Society’s events programme, the fundraising of our chapters, by donations and bequests and by sales from the Society’s online book and gift shop.

The current project (2011- ) is the restoration of Dublin's 1760s City Assembly House in South William Street. This was the first purpose-built public exhibition gallery in Britain or Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.openhousedublin.com/index.php/tour/city-assembly-house/&lt;/ref&gt; From 1809 it was the debating chamber of [[Dublin Corporation]] for nearly a century, and was the scene of many famous speeches by [[Daniel O'Connell]].

==Membership==
The Society is a membership organisation whose purpose is to promote awareness and the protection of Ireland's architectural heritage and decorative arts. The Society was founded in 1958 by the Hon. [[Desmond Guinness]] and his late wife Mariga and since that time many buildings of significant architectural merit have been saved through their work and the work of members and supporters. The next President of the Society was [[Desmond FitzGerald, 29th Knight of Glin]], who died in 2011, followed by [[Patrick Guinness]].&lt;ref&gt; Ronald Porter, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/desmond-fitzgerald-last-of-the-knights-of-glin-and-champion-of-irelands-heritage-2369621.html "Desmond Fitzgerald: Last of the Knights of Glin and champion of Ireland's heritage"], Independent, October 2011 &lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 the Hon. Desmond Guinness was awarded a [[Europa Nostra]] prize for the Society's preservation activities.

==50th anniversary==
A fully illustrated book by Robert O'Byrne on the society's first 50 years was published in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/1906429022 The Georgian Society Celebration]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events==
In June 2015 a summer school is planned, with the [[Ulster Architectural Heritage Society]], entitled Conservation without frontiers: Historic buildings of Armagh and Monaghan in context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UAHS &amp; IGS Summer School Open For Booking Now|url=http://www.uahs.org.uk/news/?q=0&amp;article=194|website=Ulster Architectural Heritage Society|accessdate=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support from the USA and UK==
Much of the Society's income comes from supporters outside Ireland. In the USA they were registered in 1968 as Irish Georgian Society Inc., and in the UK as the "Irish Georgian Trust".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.charitiestrust.org/charities/IrishGeorgianTrust/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; The Society's work within the [[Republic of Ireland]] is managed by the Irish-registered Irish Georgian Foundation, registered in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cro.ie/search/CompanyDetails.aspx?id=32176&amp;type=C&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Jefferson Scholars Foundation''' provides a full scholarship program benefiting select undergraduate and graduate students at [[The University of Virginia]] and has been named as one of the two leading scholarship programs in the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://provost.utk.edu/forum/honors.php The Provost's Forum]&lt;/ref&gt;  Named after [[Thomas Jefferson]], the university's founder and visionary, the foundation aims to "identify, attract, and nurture individuals of extraordinary intellectual range and depth who possess the highest qualities of leadership, scholarship, and citizenship."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jeffersonscholars.org Jefferson Scholars Foundation Official Site].&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to funding tuition and fees, the scholarship program provides undergraduates with extensive programming including an introductory outdoor weekend, international travel, a summer leadership and citizenship institute, internships and an extensive speaker series. 

==History and background==

Founded in the 1980–1981 academic year by the board of managers of the [[University of Virginia Alumni Association]], the Jefferson Scholars Foundation was a product of the "board’s desire to put in place a tangible program that would reflect the educational ideals of Thomas Jefferson."&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;[http://www.jeffersonscholars.org/about/ Jefferson Scholars Foundation: About].&lt;/ref&gt; The first class  yielded twelve scholars who graduated in 1985. 

In time, the foundation worked to increase the size of incoming Jefferson Scholar classes. The regional competitions increased from just a few to the 50 that presently exist. The number of nominees has grown to over 1,800 each year, and volunteer committee participation utilizes roughly 800 U.Va. alumni and faculty who participate in the nomination and selection process.&lt;ref name="Jefferson Scholars Foundation 2016 Annual Report"/&gt;

==Undergraduate selection process==

For aspiring Jefferson Scholars, the selection process can be quite rigorous. Students attending one of the more than 4,000 eligible secondary schools in the US must be nominated by their respective institution. Each secondary school is assigned to one of 53 regional areas across the United States which serve to select finalists in the competition.  The regional selection process, executed by committees of UVA alumni, varies and can include three levels of selection (an application and up to two interviews) to determine any finalists. These individuals are then brought to Charlottesville for the finalist selection weekend. Students not attending an eligible secondary school or students living outside one of the established regions (including international students) are automatically considered for the finalist weekend based on their UVA application and selected by a separate panel. All finalist expenses for the selection weekend, including travel, are paid for by the foundation.

In 2016, 1825 student nominations were made by secondary schools; 120 of these students were selected for the finalist weekend, and 34 were awarded Jefferson Scholarships.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jeffersonscholars.org/scholarship Jefferson Scholars Selection Process]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Usually taking place in March, the finalist weekend is actually an exhaustive four-day experience allowing students the opportunity to exhibit their strengths. While some time is dedicated to informative activities concerning UVA and a specialized tour of Thomas Jefferson's [[Monticello]], the majority of the weekend is spent on activities where individual merits may be judged. Judges utilize a math &amp; logic exam, a written essay, two sets of faculty moderated panel discussions based on readings provided before the weekend, and a final interview with a panel of judges to select a class. Of the finalists, a class of around 30 students is selected, representing less than 2% of those originally nominated. 

The university has seen success in retaining students nominated for (but not awarded) the Jefferson Scholarship. In recent years, approximately nine percent of the incoming first year class were nominees from their respective secondary school.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ahherald.com/index.php/Schools/area-student-among-new-class-of-jefferson-scholars-at-the-university-of-virginia.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programming==
===First year===

The class spends three days at an outdoor/high-ropes course in Charlottesville. The event is utilized to encourage team building among the class as they camp, cook meals, and participate in numerous activities including high and low ropes courses.

===Second year===

Class participates in a Leadership and Citizenship Institute. Because leadership and citizenship are two pillars of the scholarship program, the foundation focuses on emphasizing these qualities through a specialized two-week program. Occurring in August before a scholar's second year, the class is housed on grounds at the university and participates in many different activities. These activities vary slightly by year but generally include numerous speakers and workshops, a service project, team building activities, and public speaking exercises. The weekend between weeks is left open for scholars to plan class activities.

===Third year===

The international travel experience occurs during the summer before third year. The international travel program is broken into structured and independent portions. 

The structured program offers three different trips for third year scholars. The two oldest trips take place in Tuscany and London and have existed for many years. A trip taking students throughout the European Union existed previously but was replaced in 2007 by a new itinerary to focus on Asia. Scholars are asked to rank their trip preferences in December of their second year and the foundation then assigns scholars to one of the three trips.

Each trip focuses on a specific topic to appeal to the different interests of scholars.

====Tuscany program====
Entitled, "Civilization in Tuscany: A Case Study of Creativity, Continuity, and Change," this trip takes place at the Erasmus Institute &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tuscanclassicalacademy.org Erasmus Institute]/&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Capitignano]] and is led by Michael Aeschlimann.&lt;ref name="jeffersonscholars.org1"&gt;[http://www.jeffersonscholars.org/undergraduate/enrichment.html Jefferson Scholars Enrichment Program]&lt;/ref&gt; This trip focuses on art and architecture and takes students to many of the Tuscan towns and museums to study. 

====London Program====
Entitled, “The Culture of London: Past and Present,” this trip takes place at [[Regent's College]] in London. This program's subject is the city of London itself and its interdisciplinary approach combines English literature, history, and urban culture. The program is taught by UVA English professors Michael Levenson and Clare Kinney.&lt;ref name="jeffersonscholars.org1"/&gt;

====Asia Program====
Entitled, "China: Four Corners," this trip takes place in one or more countries in Asia and is designed and led by a senior UVA faculty member. Started in 2007 and led by Economics professor Bruce Reynolds, the trip started in Osaka, Japan and included a several night stay in a [[Shingon Buddhist]] Temple atop [[Mount Koya]]. In addition, the group traveled to [[Kyoto]], Japan and then to [[Beijing]]. After a night of camping and hiking on the [[Great Wall of China]], students boarded the [[Lhasa Railway]] for the 48-hour trip to Tibet upon the highest altitude train track in the world. After a stay in [[Lhasa]] and seeing the [[Jokang]] Temple and [[Potala Palace]], scholars camped and hiked to remote Tibetan Buddhist monasteries. The final stop for the trip was in [[Shanghai]]. Recently, the trip has been designed and overseen by UVA politics professor Brantly Womack. Since then the Japan portion of the trip has been removed and replaced with additional cities in China including [[Xi'an]] and [[Hong Kong]], while many other portions of the trip in Beijing, Tibet, and Shanghai remain the same.&lt;ref name="jeffersonscholars.org1"/&gt;

====Independent study====
The second portion of the international travel program is an independent study. In the spring semester of a scholar's second year, each student proposes a project to the foundation for their study. The guidelines for these projects are purposefully flexible and state that each scholar must choose a topic that cannot be fully explored from a computer and requires that they leave the country.

Each project is unique; some scholars choose to focus on subjects diverting from strict academia while others choose to do academically significant research. While many scholars choose to do their independent in Europe as they are already there from their structured program, others have been known to do their studies in other parts of the world, including Africa, Asia and South America.

==Funding==

Early on, the Jefferson Scholars competition was overseen by the Alumni Association, with university clubs funding several of the scholars. By the mid-1980s, however, private support from individuals became the main focus of funding efforts.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;[http://www.jeffersonscholars.org Jefferson Scholars Foundation].&lt;/ref&gt; 

The foundation’s endowment in 2016 stood at just over $359 million.&lt;ref name="Jefferson Scholars Foundation 2016 Annual Report"/&gt;

For the 2015–16 academic year, the in-state monetary award for scholars exceeded $31,000. The out-of-state award exceeded $61,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jeffersonscholars.org/scholarship Jefferson Scholars Selection Process]&lt;/ref&gt;  This money is used to cover the full cost of attending UVA which includes tuition, board, books, etc. The stipend for Jefferson Graduate Fellows is $30,000.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

'''Francis James "Jock" Turcot''' (5 October 1943 – 25 December 1965) was President of the [[Student Federation of the University of Ottawa]] (then known as the Students' Union of the University of Ottawa) in 1965 and a leading figure of the Canadian student movement in the 1960s.

== Early life ==
Turcot was born on 5 October 1943 in [[Kenora]]. He was the eldest of 11 children.

== Early involvement at uOttawa ==
Fluent in English and French, he came to the [[University of Ottawa]] to study civil law. His first notable post within the SUUO was when he became Publications Commissioner in April 1964.

As Publications Commissioner, he also created a commission with the goal of creating a charter for both the student papers.&lt;ref&gt;La Rotonde. Points saillants du programme de Jock Turcot. Published 11 March 1965&lt;/ref&gt;

== Presidency of the SUUO ==
=== Campbell Crisis ===
In the 1960s, the relationship between the student government and the university was marked by a battle for autonomy on the part of the student government. The university often interfered in the SUUO's affairs and threatened several times to expel student leaders for their activism, while the faculty associations repeatedly threatened to separate from the SUUO and the SUUO struggled financially. In late 1964, those tensions climaxed when SUUO President Robert Campbell attacked the university, accusing it of ignoring students and wasting their time, and stating that the SUUO would do whatever it took to gain independence. The SUUO's Grand Council, however, used that letter as a pretext to impeach Campbell, at which point the rest of the SUUO exec resigned in solidarity with Campbell.

In the special election that followed, Turcot quickly emerged as the compromise candidate, seeing as he had not been particularly involved with any of the political factions on campus.&lt;ref&gt;Duclos, Jocelyn-Robert. Jock Turcot élu president de l’AGÉUO? La Rotonde. Published 14 January 1965&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 January 1965, he was elected President of the SUUO for the remainder of the 1964-65 year.

=== Presidency ===

On becoming President, he soon released a long-term plan for the SUUO, based on a Students' Charter, a study of the SUUO structure, a new SUUO Constitution, incorporation of the SUUO and the construction of a [[student centre]] for campus. He also quickly undertook consultations and meetings with all of the faculty associations on campus and began a practice of holding weekly press conferences to update students on SUUO affairs.

In March 1965, he was re-elected as President for the 1965–1966 term.

In November 1965, the SUUO led a march of over 800 students on Parliament Hill to demonstrate in favour of free tuition. As President, he also helped organise SUUO participation in the [[Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism]], highlighted the situation of international students on campus for the first time, lobbied for the introduction of a [[reading week]] in the winter semester, and oversaw the creation of a charter for the SUUO Student Court.&lt;ref&gt;The Story of Jock Turcot. Special issue of The Fulcrum. Published 4 January 1966&lt;/ref&gt; He also helped formulate the SUUO's response to the Commission on the Financing of Higher Education in Canada led by [[Vincent Bladen]], which rejected calls for free tuition.&lt;ref&gt;Toupin, Lise. Gratuité scolaire. La Rotonde. Published 26 October 1965&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://circle.ubc.ca/bitstream/handle/2429/12426/ubc_2002-0366.pdf, page 29-30&lt;/ref&gt;

== Involvement in the Canadian student movement ==
In November 1964, Turcot attended the founding meeting of the [[UGEQ]], the new national students' union in Québec. One of his goals was to negotiate membership of the SUUO, given the SUUO's bilingual nature and the high proportion of francophone students at the University of Ottawa. He came back from the meeting concerned about the future of the UGEQ, saying that the union was too dogmatic and had chosen to be a union for Québecois and not for French-Canadian students.&lt;ref&gt;Turcot, Jock. Carnet d'un voyage déconcertant. La Rotonde. Published 4 December 1964&lt;/ref&gt; Turcot was also a supporter of Canadian federalism, which ran contrary to rising [[Québec nationalism]].

At the September 1965 annual conference of the [[Canadian Union of Students]] held at [[Bishop's University]], Turcot took a leading role in proposing new policy, and was consequently offered the position of CUS President. He declined the post, stating that he wanted to concentrate on SUUO affairs.&lt;ref&gt;La Rotonde. Turcot refuse la présidence de l’UCE. Published 22 September 1965&lt;/ref&gt; At that conference, the CUS adopted a number of policies, including support for free tuition, lowering the voting age to 18 and abolishing the death penalty.&lt;ref&gt;La Rotonde. L’UCE reconnait l’UGEQ comme organisme national. Published 22 September 1965&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grace, Stephen. CUS Report on 29th Congress. The Fulcrum. Published 30 September 1965&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, Turcot also got the CUS to adopt his Declaration on the Canadian Student which called for students to form autonomous and democratic student governments, for students to have a greater say in university affairs and for students to take the lead in campaigning for social justice movements.&lt;ref&gt;La Rotonde. L’AGÉUO définit l’étudiant canadien. Published 22 September 1965&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.studentunion.ca/2013/07/the-declaration-of-the-canadian-student/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death and legacy ==
On Christmas Day 1965, Turcot died in a car accident while driving home to his family in [[St-Charles-de-Mandeville]] from the uOttawa campus. He has stayed on campus for the Christmas Eve supper for international students, and was only planning to have a short break, so that he could finish the new SUUO Constitution before the end of the Christmas holidays.

The university held a remembrance ceremony for him on 11 January in the Church du Sacré-Coeur on campus, and cancelled all classes during the ceremony to encourage students to attend.&lt;ref&gt;La Rotonde. Les étudiants rendont un dernier homage à leur chef. Published 10 January 1966&lt;/ref&gt;

The SUUO then created the Jock Turcot Memorial Fund to collect money for the construction of a student centre.&lt;ref&gt;La Rotonde. Le fonds commémoratif Jock Turcot est crée. Published 10 January 1966&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1966, students voted by a 2/3rds majority in favour of a 10 $ levy per student per year to go towards the construction of the student centre. The building opened in 1973, and was named after Turcot.&lt;ref&gt;http://maps.uottawa.ca/university-centre&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.uottawa.ca/archives/sites/www.uottawa.ca.archives/files/jock_turcot_eng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; His brother, Mark Turcot, was SFUO President when the student centre was opened.

The work he did on the structures of the SUUO had a major impact on the workings of the SUUO for decades, and the SUUO was incorporated a few years after his death (at which point it switched its name back to the SFUO). His advocacy at the national level of the Canadian student movement also had an impact for decades, as he was one of the first to gain recognition for wider social justice activism in the student movement, and the Turcot Declaration on the Canadian Student was a landmark document. The SFUO, however, failed to maintain a presence within the Québec student movement, which continued to build its own identity away from the student movement in the rest of Canada.

Jock Turcot did, however, face some criticism during his term as President. Notably, he was accused multiple times of being too close to the university administration and of having a weak and too conservative policy on incorporation.&lt;ref&gt;Duhamel, Luc. AGÉUM ou AGÉUO. La Rotonde. Published 25 February 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Perron, Alain. Campbell sera réélu. La Rotonde. Published 11 March 1965&lt;/ref&gt; He was also sometimes accused of gaining support based on his good looks, and not based on merit.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13461">'''JuicyCampus'''.com  was a website focusing on [[gossip]], [[rumor]]s, and [[Monologue|rants]] related to [[college]]s and [[university|universities]] in the [[United States]].  As of February 5, 2009, it is out of business.

JuicyCampus described itself as an enabler of "online anonymous free speech on [[college]] campuses".  Through strict privacy policies, it allowed users to post messages and comments without having to worry about identification.  Readers were able to vote on which posts they found "juiciest", or most provocative. As of March 16, 2008 the site contained rumors for 59 colleges and universities.&lt;ref name="CrashCourseGossipNYT1"&gt;"A Crash Course in Online Gossip." ''[[The New York Times]]''. [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/16/fbashion/16juicy.html?em&amp;ex=1205812800&amp;en=099611f51958dfcf&amp;ei=5087%0A 1].&lt;/ref&gt; By October 2008, JuicyCampus had expanded to over 500 college campuses. Much of its content was related to fraternities and sororities.&lt;ref name="CrashCourseGossipNYT1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://media.www.dailyillini.com/media/storage/paper736/news/2008/02/07/Diversions/Web-Site.Features.Campus.Gossip-3193418-page2.shtml | title = Web site features campus gossip | author = Smith, Missy| date =2008-02-07 | work=[[The Daily Illini]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080318234006/http://media.www.dailyillini.com/media/storage/paper736/news/2008/02/07/Diversions/Web-Site.Features.Campus.Gossip-3193418-page2.shtml|archivedate=2008-03-18|deadurl=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The creator of JuicyCampus, identified in an article in ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]'' as a [[Duke University]] [[alumni|alumnus]] named Matt Ivester,&lt;ref name="ChronicleHigher"&gt;Young, Jeffrey R. "[http://www.chronicle.com/article/How-to-Combat-a-Campus-Gossip/597 How to Combat a Campus Gossip Web Site (and Why You Shouldn't)]." ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]''. March 17, 2008. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080320041711/http://www.chronicle.com/free/2008/03/2136n.htm|archivedate=20080320041711}}&lt;/ref&gt; described the website as within a trend of "gossip 2.0", which he sees as "pretty entertaining".&lt;ref name="CrashCourseGossipNYT1"/&gt; Timothy Chester, chief information officer of [[Pepperdine University]], described the purpose of JuicyCampus in a letter written to [[Google]] as to create a "'virtual [[bathroom]] wall' for abusive, degrading, and hateful speech".&lt;ref name="ChronicleHigher"/&gt;

==History==
The website began operation in August 2007,&lt;ref name="ChronicleHigher"/&gt; and was closed indefinitely on February 5, 2009 due to lack of revenue.

It was initially launched on just seven campuses (Duke University, Loyola Marymount University, UNC, USC, Pepperdine, UCLA and College of Charleston).

On December 8, 2007 from a computer at [[Loyola Marymount University]], a student allegedly posted a threat to shoot random students on the campus' "Alumni Mall". The quote read, "I am going to shoot and kill as many people as I can until which time I am incapacitated or killed by the police." The [[Los Angeles Police Department]] apprehended the suspect. The police released the suspect without filing charges. The message was originally posted on the website [[4chan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://media.www.laloyolan.com/media/storage/paper803/news/2007/12/06/News/Shooting.Threat.Suspect.Apprehended-3139751.shtml | title = Shooting threat suspect apprehended | author = Nader Alsheikh | date = December 8, 2007 | accessdate = 2007-12-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://edition.cnn.com/2007/US/12/09/blogger.threat.ap/index.html | title =

=== Controversy ===
JuicyCampus has received much media attention for not censoring the content posted by its users. [[CNN]] released an article documenting the anonymous rumors on the website and the panic felt by students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/TECH/02/18/juicy.website.ap/index.html |title=College Web site posts sex gossip, hate, rumor |date=February 18, 2008 |work=[[CNN]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070813051512/http://edition.cnn.com/2008/TECH/02/18/juicy.website.ap/index.html |archivedate=2007-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Matt Ivester, the site's creator, has done numerous interviews defending the website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/CRIME/03/17/sunny.juicy/index.html |title=Online campus gossips won't show their faces |work=[[CNN]] |date=April 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larry Moneta, the vice president for student affairs at Duke University said that when he asked Ivester to moderate the website Ivester refused and indicated that he believes moderation is an unnecessary step toward censorship.&lt;ref name="ChronicleHigher"/&gt; ''The Chronicle of Higher Education'' said that "the site revels in the publicity it gets" and that the website keeps a list of websites, including those that are critical of ''JuicyCampus'' in a [[blog]].&lt;ref name="ChronicleHigher"/&gt; Ivester, a 2005 Duke graduate, said on his website's official blog that "Hate isn't juicy", encouraging users to think carefully about what they were writing and whether their posts were entertaining or just plain mean.&lt;ref name="CrashCourseGossipNYT1"/&gt;

In December 2007, [[Randolph-Macon College]] blocked students from accessing juicy campus on the campus network claiming that the site had no intellectual contribution to society.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

In January 2008 the undergraduate student government at [[Pepperdine University]] passed a resolution asking for a block on the site.&lt;ref name="ChronicleHigher"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WashingtonPostSlimy"&gt;Fisher, Marc. "Dorm Gossip Turns Slimy on the Internet." ''[[The Washington Post]]''. March 2, 2008 [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/01/AR2008030101418_2.html 2].&lt;/ref&gt; The administration did not enact the block. Austin Maness, a Pepperdine senior who wrote the resolution, said that he felt that the move was "a mistake" as it increased awareness of the website.&lt;ref name="CrashCourseGossipNYT1"/&gt; The administration of Pepperdine complained to [[Google]]; Daniel Rubin, a Google spokesman, said that Google removed ''JuicyCampus'' from its advertising network due to "excessive [[profanity]]". By January 2008, ''JuicyCampus'' moved to another advertising network.&lt;ref name="ChronicleHigher"/&gt; [[Texas Christian University]] students asked advertisers to not buy space on the website.&lt;ref name="WashingtonPostSlimy"/&gt; In November 2008, officials at [[High Point University]] requested that the website remove the school from its servers. When JuicyCampus refused, the University blocked the site from its campus network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://media.www.campuschronicle.org/media/storage/paper1319/news/2008/11/21/StaffEditorial/Website.Spreads.Slander.About.Students-3556702.shtml | title = Website spreads slander about students | author = Nelson, Katie | date = November 21, 2008 | accessdate = 2008-12-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the same month [[Tennessee State University]] (TSU) blocked JuicyCampus. Ivester criticized the decision and compared it to the [[People's Republic of China]]'s [[Internet censorship in the People's Republic of China|censoring of the internet]].&lt;ref&gt;Young, Jeffrey R. "[http://chronicle.com/free/2008/11/7650n.htm JuicyCampus Is Blocked on 2 Campuses, and Gossipers on Another Face a Lawsuit]." ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]''. Thursday November 20, 2008. Retrieved on December 27, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] criticized the decision. JuicyCampus filed a lawsuit against TSU and asked students to join the suit.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Jonathan. "[http://www.wsmv.com/news/18247504/detail.html#- College Gossip Site Sues TSU]." ''[[WSMV-TV]]''. December 10, 2008. Retrieved on December 27, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2008, the office of the [[Attorney General of New Jersey]], [[Anne Milgram]], started an investigation into the website. Milgram said that because the site promises to block offensive content, but does not have a mechanism for reporting such content, it may be in violation of the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://wbjb.org/home.php/2008/03/19/college-gossip-web-site-targeted-by-nj-attorney-general/ |title=College Gossip Web Site Targeted By NJ Attorney General |agency=[[Associated Press]] |work=[[WBJB]] |date=March 19, 2008 |accessdate=May 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2008 the office [[subpoena]]ed the website.&lt;ref&gt;Benner, Kate.

''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]''. March 26, 2008. Retrieved on March 16, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2008, The [[GW Patriot]] and "The Colonialist", two student-run publications at [[The George Washington University]], called for students to [[Spam (electronic)|spam]] the university's JuicyCampus page in order to fill the site with irrelevant material. Their goal was to reduce the forum's popularity on campus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gwpatriot.com/2008/10/06/engaging-juicycampus/ "Engaging JuicyCampus," The GW Patriot] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330084354/http://www.gwpatriot.com/2008/10/06/engaging-juicycampus/ |date=2012-03-30 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecolonialist.com/2008/10/how-to-defeat-juicy-campus/ "How To Defeat JuicyCampus," The Colonialist] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081009032058/http://www.thecolonialist.com/2008/10/how-to-defeat-juicy-campus/ |date=2008-10-09 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mancinik, Joe and Nathan Grossman.

''GW Hatchet''. October 9, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Purchase Independent'', a student newspaper of the [[State University of New York at Purchase]], published a pro-Juicy Campus editorial and an anti-Juicy Campus editorial. The pro-JC one argued that it helped contain "moronic" discussion and students to a single website.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://web.archive.org/web/20100531192846/http://independent.blogs.purchase.edu/2008/10/29/point-counter-point-juicy-campus/ Juicy Campus: Containing The Idiot Within Our Student Body]," ''[[The Purchase Independent]]''. October 29, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Juicycampus ceased operations on February 5, 2009 because of financial problems, specifically an inability to turn a profit.&lt;ref&gt;Go, Alison: [https://www.usnews.com/education/blogs/paper-trail/2009/02/04/juicy-campus-will-be-shut-down Juicy Campus will be shut down].

The '''literary estate''' of a deceased [[author]] consists mainly of the [[copyright]] and other [[intellectual property]] rights of published works, including [[film rights|film]], [[translation]] rights, original manuscripts of published work, unpublished or partially completed work, and papers of intrinsic literary interest such as correspondence or personal diaries and records. In [[academia]], the [[German language|German]] term ''[[Nachlass]]'' for the legacy of papers is often used.

==Literary executor==

A '''literary executor''' is a person acting on behalf of beneficiaries (e.g. family members, a designated charity, a research library or archive) under the author's '''[[Will and testament|will]]'''.  The executor is responsible for entering into contracts with publishers, collecting royalties, maintaining copyrights, and (where appropriate) arranging for the deposit of letters.  According to ''Wills, Administration and Taxation: a practical guide'' (1990, UK)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Barlow, J. S., King, L. C., King, A. G.|title=Wills, Administration and Taxation: a practical guide|date=1990|page=192|publisher=Sweet and Maxwell, London|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WUAOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA192 |accessdate=14 November 2014|isbn=9780421431003}}&lt;/ref&gt; "A will may appoint different executors to deal with different parts of the estate. One example of this is the appointment of a literary executor to deal with literary effects [...]".

Since the literary estate is a legacy to the author's [[heir]]s, the management of it in financial terms is a responsibility of trust. The position of literary [[executor]] extends beyond the monetary aspect, though: appointment to such a position, perhaps informally, is often a matter of the author's choice during his or her lifetime.

If a sympathetic and understanding friend is in the position of literary executor, there can be conflict: what is to be managed is not just a portfolio of intellectual property but a posthumous reputation. Wishes of the deceased author may have been clearly expressed but are not always respected. Family members often express strong feelings about privacy of the dead. For example, biographical writing is likely to be of a quite different authority if it is carried out with access to private papers. The literary executor then becomes a gatekeeper.

===Examples===
Examples of literary executors include Sir [[Edward Marsh (polymath)|Edward Marsh]] for [[Rupert Brooke]], [[Robert Baldwin Ross]] for [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Robert Hayward Barlow]] for [[H. P. Lovecraft]], [[Rush Rhees]] for [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], [[Otto Nathan]] for [[Albert Einstein]], and [[Regine Olsen]] for [[Søren Kierkegaard]].

A particularly notorious example is [[Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche]] for [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], as she resorted to fraud to make her brother's ''Nachlass'' more compatible with Nazi ideology.{{cn|date=February 2017}} An exceptionally productive example is that of [[Rudolf Steiner]]. Although he did not originally intend that the stenographs of his thousands of lectures be published, he relented and named his second wife, [[Marie Steiner-von Sivers]], to direct his ''Nachlass'', which has produced more than three hundred volumes since his death in 1925.

Older examples of such appointments, such as [[Kenelm Digby]] for [[Ben Jonson]], are essentially editorial rather than legal. A contemporary case is [[Christopher Tolkien]]'s work on [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s papers.

A notable example is the case of [[Franz Kafka]], who left no will. His friend [[Max Brod]] assumed the function of literary executor, though most of the literary estate was legally owned by Marianne Steiner and Věra Saudková.&lt;ref&gt;{{ODNBweb|id=94106|title=Pasley, Sir John Malcolm|first=T.

== History ==
The original name at creation is the '''Cameroon School of Administration''' ('''ECA'''). This school is the main crucible of administrators of the Cameroonian [[civil service]] since the [[independence of Cameroon]] on May 1, 1960. In 1961, the school opens a special cycle to prepare for the entrance examination to the normal cycles of candidates from the under-educated regions. Cameroon has two official [[national language]]s since independence and [[reunification]]. As a result, in 1963, a preparatory cycle for the entrance examination to Cycle A and B for English-speaking candidates were launched. The major change came in 1964: The Cameroon School of Administration (ECA) became the '''Normal School of Administration and Magistracy (ENAM)'''. The main mission also changed. It is now necessary to train the civil and financial personnel of the State, as well as the [[magistrate]]s of the [[judiciary]]. In 1985, ENAM became part of the National Center for Administration and Magistracy (CENAM) with the Higher Institute of Public Management (ISMP) and the Institute of Administrative and Financial Techniques (ITAF). 1995 marks the reopening of cycles A and B for the training of civil and financial service personnel. This year also marks the creation of the Research and Documentation Center for administrative problems. 2010 marks the opening of admission to the Judicial Division to graduates of Computer Science and Economics of Higher Education. Since 2012, graduates in [[computer science]] and [[economics]] of higher education compete for admission to the Division of the Judiciary and Transplants.

=== Initial training on competition ===

==== Entrance examinations ====
The decrees of the Minister of [[Public service|Public Service]] and Administrative Reform, opening the competition, set the uniform conditions for all candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://minajobs.com/cameroun/job/ministere-de-la-fonction-publique-et-de-la-la-reforme-administrative-cameroun-6-concours-2016-dentree-a-lenam-auditeurs-de-justice-ecole-nationale-dadministration-et-de-magistratur/|title=« CONCOURS 2016 D’ENTREE A L’ENAM : AUDITEURS DE JUSTICE – ÉCOLE NATIONALE D’ADMINISTRATION ET DE MAGISTRATURE DU CAMEROUN et MINFOPRA {{!}} MinaJobs.com Cameroun »|last=|first=|date=|website=sur minajobs.com (consulté le 7 mai 2016)|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of eligible places is prorated according to the requests of administrations. The competitions take place in the unique center of Yaounde. Access modes in the first year are identical for the competition internally and externally.

* For the internal competition, only public servants aged 45 and over with at least 5 years of professional seniority may compete for the B cycle. They must submit an authorization provided by the Ministry of Public Service. and administrative reform.
* For the external competition, candidates must have a Baccalaureate or Advance Level (A/L) certificates for Cycle B and be at least 32 years old at the time of the competition. For Cycle A, candidates must have a Bachelor's degree or other equivalent degree. The master's degree in law is required for the auditors of justice.

The exam period is between April and June. The exam fees are unique and amount to 15,000 FCFA. The duration of the training depends on the cycle chosen. It consists of two years of training for cycles A and clerk and one year of training for cycle B. The competition is held at the unique center which is the political capital Yaoundé. The subjects on which we compete are the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mongosukulu.com/index.php/en/ecoles-universites/grandes-ecoles/780-enam-ecole-nationale-d-administration-et-de-magistrature|title=ENAM (Ecole Nationale d’Administration et de Magistrature)|last=Administrator|website=www.mongosukulu.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Opportunities ====
ENAM students are integrated directly into the [[civil service]] and become public servants. They are classified as A1 for those in Cycle B and A2 for those in Cycle A.

== Controversies ==
The entry examination to ENAM is generally tainted with controversies that challenge the objective and transparent character of eligibility.

In 2004, eighty-eight (88) candidates in the ENAM competition received a three-year suspension, all examinations in all university courses for "fraud" and "attempted fraud".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.panapress.com/88-candidats-interdits-de-concours-a-l-ENAM--12-721135-58-lang1-index.html|title=88 candidats interdits de concours à l'ENAM|website=www.panapress.com|language=fr|access-date=2018-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2006, Benjamin Amama Amam, then Minister of Public Service and Vocational Training, ordered the cancellation of the ENAM results competitions for the 2005-2006 session, following a January 2006 report denounces exam fraud. He later reversed his decision by order of Jules Doret Ndongo, then Secretary General of the [[Prime Minister of Cameroon|Prime Minister's]] Office.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cameroon-info.net/stories/0,35316,@,grandes-ecoles-la-corruption-gagne-les-feuilles-de-concours.html|title=" Cameroon-Info.Net :: Grandes Ecoles: La corruption gagne les feuilles de concours "|last=|first=|date=|website=sur www.cameroon-info.net, 18 juin 2012 (consulté le 8 mai 2016)|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cameroonvoice.com/news/article-news-18020.html|title=Cameroun.

In October 2009, Dr. Shanda Tomne, then Chairperson of the Independent Commission Against Corruption and Discrimination (COMICODI), sends a letter of denunciation of the results of the first-year entrance examination of the Judicial Division, Judicial Section, to the Director General of ENAM.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://aeud.fr/ENAM-LABORATOIRE-DU-TRIBALISME-ET.html|title=ENAM LABORATOIRE DU TRIBALISME ET DE LA CORRUPTION‏|work=AEUD.INFO : L'action prend corps|access-date=2018-08-20|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Prime Minister [[Philémon Yang|Philemon Yang]] instructed the Director General of ENAM, Linus Toussaint Mendjana, the exclusion of six students who were admitted on the sole instruction of the Speaker of the National Assembly [[Cavayé Yéguié Djibril|Cavaye Yeguié Djibril]], and not by competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.etudiant-ados.com/pages/actualite-afrique/kongossa/man-uvres-le-premier-ministre-philemon-yang-chasse-les-proches-de-cavaye-y-djibril-de-l-enam.html|title=" Manœuvres: Le Premier Ministre Philemon Yang chasse les proches de Cavaye Y.

'''Pengajaran dan Pembelajaran Sains dan Matematik Dalam Bahasa Inggeris'''  ('''PPSMI''') (''the teaching and learning of science and mathematics in English'') is a government policy aimed at improving the command of the English language among pupils at primary and secondary schools in [[Malaysia]]. In accordance to this policy, the [[Science]] and [[Mathematics]] subjects are taught in the English medium as opposed to the [[Malay language|Malay]] medium used before. This policy was introduced in 2003 by the then-[[Prime Minister of Malaysia]], [[Mahathir Mohamad]]. PPSMI has been the subject of debate among academics, politicians and the public alike, which culminated to the announcement of the policy's reversal in 2012 by the Deputy Prime Minister, Tan Sri [[Muhyiddin Yassin]].

==History==
PPSMI's inception as a Malaysian Government policy was the result of the Cabinet meeting on 19 July 2002 under the administration of the fourth prime minister, [[Mahathir Mohamad]]. According to the Malaysian Ministry of Education, the policy would be run in stages, starting with the 2003 school session, pioneered by the all students of Year 1 in primary education level, and Form 1 of the secondary education level. PPSMI was then fully implemented to all secondary students in 2007, and to all primary students in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pengajaran Dan Pembelajaran Sains Dan Matematik (PPSMI)|last=|first=|publisher=Kementerian Pelajaran Malaysia|date=7 August 2008|url=http://www.moe.gov.my/tayang.php?laman=ppsmi&amp;unit=guru&amp;bhs=my&amp;mod=baca|accessdate=16 February 2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objective==
According to the statement regarding PPSMI in the Ministry of Education's website:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moe.gov.my/?id=130&amp;lang=en] Kementerian Pelajaran Malaysia&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The rationale for the decision to change the medium of instruction from the Malay Language to English for the teaching and learning of Science and Mathematics subjects was made based on the government’s concern on the nation’s human capital development towards achieving the standard of a developed country, as well as an early preparation to compete in the era of globalization.

It is widely known that the field of science and mathematics form the basis and have a crucial role in the progress and development of a country. Various innovations and discoveries in these two fields happen rapidly and information access is mostly in the English language.

English language is also the language spoken internationally and mastery in this language would allow easy access to information in these fields.

In conclusion, the policy decision to implement PPSMI was made to ensure students’ mastery in science and mathematics in view of the fact that most of the sources are available in the English language. Indirectly, it is also hoped that the implementation of PPSMI would contribute to the enhancing of students’ command of the language.}}

When proposing the policy, Tun Dr. Mahathir was in the opinion that Malaysia's progress is declining in the age of [[globalisation]], and he had hoped that this policy gives a competitive edge to the nation, following the footsteps of [[Singapore]] and [[India]] which are moving forward because of their utilisation of the English language.

==Implementation==
PPSMI was implemented for the 2003 school session students enrolling in Year 1 and Form 1 in primary and secondary schools respectively. Students of other grades are not affected, and continued to study Mathematics and Science in the mother tongue. PPSMI learning materials were offered in the form of packages consisting of these components:
* '''Textbooks''': Given to students as the basic source for learning on concepts and skills in Science and Mathematics.
* '''Activity Books''': Given as supplementary material for students to practice their understanding of the concepts learned from textbooks. These "Buku Latihan dan Aktiviti" or "BLA" were provided for students of Year 1 only.
* '''Teacher's Guide''': Material prepared for teachers as reference and guide to plan and implement effective teaching of the Science and Mathematics.
* '''MyCD''' or "Pupil's CD-ROM": "BLA" in the form of multimedia presentations recorded in compacts discs and included with every Activity Book. The contents consists of an interactive games and simulators as well as electronic tests.
* '''Teacher's CD-ROM''': This material was meant to help teachers  to plan and implement effective teaching of the Science and Mathematics. Among the contents are questions banks, additional activities as well as URLs to websites with relevance to the subject. These CDs are included in the Teacher's Guide.
* '''Science Practical Book''': Published to ensure that Science are taught not only in theory but also in practice.
* '''Glossary Book''': A reference guide containing definition to terms pervasive in Science and Mathematics.

As for the implementation in Chinese schools, after a protest was made by the nation's union of Chinese schools Dong Jiao Zong, a compromise was reached where the teaching of Science and Mathematics was made done both in English and Mandarin.&lt;ref name=djz&gt;[http://www.djz.edu.my/resource/math/PDF/memorandum_bm.pdf KEMBALIKAN BAHASA IBUNDA: Mengembalikan Penggunaan Bahasa Ibunda Sebagai Bahasa Pengantar Dan Bahasa Peperiksaan Bagi Mata Pelajaran Sains Dan Matematik Di Sekolah Rendah; Memorandum kepada Y.A.B.

'''Peer support''' occurs when people provide knowledge, experience, emotional, social or practical help to each other.&lt;ref&gt;Shery Mead, David Hilton, Laurie Curtis, [http://mentalhealthpeers.com/pdfs/peersupport.pdf "Peer Support: A Theoretical Perspective."]&lt;/ref&gt; It commonly refers to an initiative consisting of trained supporters (although it can be provided by peers without training), and can take a number of forms such as [[peer mentoring]], reflective listening (reflecting content and/or feelings), or [[counseling]]. Peer support is also used to refer to initiatives where colleagues, members of self-help organizations and others meet, in person or online, as equals to give each other support on a reciprocal basis.

Peer support is distinct from other forms of [[social support]] in that the source of support is a ''peer'', a person who is similar in fundamental ways to the recipient of the support; their relationship is one of equality. A peer is in a position to offer support by virtue of relevant experience: he or she has "been there, done that" and can relate to others who are now in a similar situation. Trained peer support workers such as [[peer support specialist]]s and [[Center for Victims of Torture#Training Peer Counselors|peer counselors]] receive special training and are required to obtain [[Continuing Education]] Units, like clinical staff. Some other trained peer support workers may also be law-enforcement personnel and firefighters as well as [[emergency medical responders]].

==Underlying theory==

The effectiveness of peer support is believed to derive from a variety of [[psychosocial]] processes described best by Mark Salzer in 2002:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last = Salzer  | first = Mark | year = 2002 | title = Consumer-delivered services as a best practice in mental health care and the development of practice guidelines | journal = Psychiatric rehabilitation skills | volume = 6 | pages = 355–382 | doi=10.1080/10973430208408443}}.&lt;/ref&gt; social support, experiential knowledge, social learning theory, social comparison theory and the helper-therapy principle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psychosocial.com/IJPR_10/Peer_Support_What_Makes_It_Unique_Mead.html Mead S., &amp; MacNeil C,. (2006). "Peer Support: What Makes It Unique?"], ''International Journal of Psychosocial Rehabilitation.'' 10 (2), 29-37.&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Social support]] is the existence of positive psychosocial interactions with others with whom there is mutual trust and concern.&lt;ref&gt;Sarason, I., Levine, H., Basham, R., &amp; Sarason, B. (1983). "Assessing social support: The social support questionnaire." ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology,'' 44, 127–139.&lt;/ref&gt; Positive relationships contribute to positive adjustment and buffer against stressors and adversities by offering (a) emotional support&lt;ref&gt;Raymond B. Flannery Jr., "Social support and psychological trauma: A methodological review." ''Journal of Traumatic Stress,'' Volume 3, Issue 4, pages 593–611, October 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; (esteem, attachment, and reassurance),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psychosocial.com/IJPR_10/Social_Support_and_QOL7_Young.html Young, K.W. (2006). "Social Support and Life Satisfaction"], ''International Journal of Psychosocial Rehabilitation.'' 10 (2), 155-164.&lt;/ref&gt; (b) instrumental support (material goods and services), (c) companionship&lt;ref&gt;Thoits, P. (1986). "Social support as coping assistance." ''J. Consult. Clin. Psychol.'' 54: 416-423.&lt;/ref&gt; and (d) information support (advice, guidance, and feedback).&lt;ref&gt;Phyllis Solomon, [http://www.tucollaborative.org/pdfs/Peer_Reviewed_Publications/Peer_Support_Peer_Provider_Services.pdf "Peer support/peer provided services underlying processes, benefits, and critical ingredients"], ''[[Psychiatric Rehabilitation Journal]],'' 2004;27(4):392-401; {{ISSN|1095-158X}}, doi 10.2975/27.2004.392.401, {{PMID|15222150}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Experiential knowledge]] is specialized information and perspectives that people obtain from living through a particular experience such as [[substance abuse]], a physical [[disability]], chronic physical or mental illness, or a traumatic event such as [[military action|combat]], a [[natural disaster]], [[domestic violence]] or a [[violent crime]], [[sexual abuse]], or [[Incarceration|imprisonment]]. Experiential knowledge tends to be unique and pragmatic and when shared contributes to solving problems and improving [[quality of life]].&lt;ref&gt;Shubert, M., &amp; Borkman, T. (1994). "Identifying the experiential knowledge developed within a self-help group." In T. Powell (Ed.) ''Understanding the self-help organization.'' Thousand Oaks: [[Sage Publications]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coyne J. C. and De Longis A. (1986). "Going beyond social support: The role of social relationships in adaptation." ''J. Consulting and Clinical Psychology'' 54: 454-460.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Social learning theory]] postulates that peers, because they have undergone and survived relevant experiences, are more credible [[role model]]s for others. Interactions with peers who are successfully coping with their experiences or illness are more likely to result in positive [[behavior|behavior change]].&lt;ref&gt;Salzer, M., &amp; Shear, S. L. (2002). "Identifying consumer-provider benefits in evaluations of consumer-delivered services." ''Psychiatric Rehabilitation Journal,'' 25, 281–288.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Social comparison]] means that individuals are more comfortable interacting with others who share common characteristics with themselves, such as a [[psychiatric illness]], in order to establish a sense of normalcy. By interacting with others who are perceived to be better than them, peers are given a sense of [[optimism]] and something to strive toward.&lt;ref&gt;Festinger, L. (1954).

==In schools and education==

===Peer mentoring===
{{main article|Peer mentoring}}

Peer mentoring takes place in learning environments such as schools, usually between an older more experienced student and a new student.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Grbac, [http://www.theibsc.org/uploaded/IBSC/Conference_and_workshops/Toronto_Workshops/Grbac_Handout.pdf "How to implement a ‘Peer Support’ program in a P-6 School,” [[Scotch College Junior School, Melbourne]] Australia; International Boys' Schools Coalition 15th Annual Conference, Toronto, Canada, June 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt; Peer mentors appear mainly in [[secondary school]]s where students moving up from [[primary school]]s may need assistance in settling into the whole new schedule and lifestyle of secondary school life. Peer mentoring is also used in the workplace as a means of orienting new employees. New employees who are paired with a peer mentor are twice as likely to remain in their job than those who do not receive mentorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Kaye | first1 = Beverly |last2=Jordan-Evans |first2=Sharon| title = Love 'Em or Lose Em: Getting Good People to Stay| publisher = Berrett-Koehler Publishers| year = 2005 | location = San Francisco | page = 117 | isbn=978-1-57675-327-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peer listening===
This form of peer support is widely used within schools.&lt;ref&gt;[[Helen Cowie]], Patti Wallace, ''Peer Support in Action: From Bystanding to Standing By,'' Sage Publications Ltd; 1st edition February 2001; {{ISBN|0-7619-6353-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sandy Hazouri, Miriam Smith McLaughlin, ''Peer listening in the middle school: training activities for students.''

Carpentieri, [http://www.nspcc.org.uk/Inform/resourcesforteachers/classroomresources/EverySchoolPDF_wdf55391.pdf "Every school should have one: How peer support schemes make schools better"], [[ChildLine]], January 2008,  {{ISBN|0-9524948-8-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; to be "[[active listening|active listeners]]".&lt;ref&gt;Joel H.

==In health==

===In mental health===
{{see also|Peer support specialist}}
Peer support can occur within, outside or around traditional mental health services and programs, between two people or in groups. Peer support is a key concept in the [[recovery approach]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.centreformentalhealth.org.uk/recovery/peer_workers.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; and in consumer-operated services programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cosp.mimhtraining.com/final-report-10-chapters-appendices/ Campbell, J. ''The Consumer-Operated Services Program (COSP) Multisite study,'' Missouri Institute of Mental Health, St. Louis, 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Psychiatric survivors movement|Consumers/clients]] of mental health programs have also formed non-profit [[self-help groups|self-help]] organizations,&lt;ref&gt;Ochocka, J., Janzen, R., &amp; Nelson, G.

''Clinical Psychology: Science and Practice,'' 6(2), 165-187.&lt;/ref&gt; The role of peer workers in mental health services was the subject of a conference in London in April 2012, jointly organized by the [[Centre for Mental Health]] and the NHS Confederation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nhsconfed.org/Networks/MentalHealth/events/recent_events/Pages/mh-peer-support.aspx.&lt;/ref&gt; Research has shown that peer-run self-help groups yield improvement in psychiatric symptoms resulting in decreased hospitalization, larger social support networks and enhanced [[self-esteem]] and social functioning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dbsalliance.org/site/PageServer?pagename=research_advances "Peer Support Research: A Promising New Approach."]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.consumerstar.org/pubs/Emerging%20New%20Practices%20in%20Oraganized%20Peer%20Support.pdf Jean Campbell and Judy Leaver, "Emerging New Practices in Organized Peer Support," National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors (NASMHPD) and the National Technical Assistance Center for State Mental Health Planning (NTAC), March 2003, p. 17.]&lt;/ref&gt; There is considerable variety in the ways that peer support is defined and conceptualized as it relates to mental health services.  In some cases, clinicians, psychiatrists, and other staff who do not necessarily have their own experiences of receiving psychiatric treatment are being trained, often by [[Psychiatric survivors movement|psychiatric survivors]], in peer support as an approach to building relationships that are genuine, mutual, and non-coercive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Home Content|url = http://www.intentionalpeersupport.org|website = Intentional Peer Support|accessdate = 2015-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====For anxiety and depression====
In [[Canada]], the [http://www.anxietybc.com/leaf.php LEAF ''(Living Effectively with Anxiety and Fear)'' Program] is a peer-led support group for [[cognitive-behavioral therapy]] of persons with mild to moderate [[panic disorder]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heretohelp.bc.ca/sites/default/files/visions_cognitivetherapy.pdf Shelley Jones, "The LEAF Program: Peer-led Group CBT"], ''Visions: BC's Mental Health and Addictions Journal,'' Vol 6, no. 1 2009, pp. 16-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2011 [[meta-analysis]] of seven [[randomized trial]]s that compared a peer support intervention to group cognitive-behavioral therapy in patients suffering from [[major depressive disorder|depression]], peer support interventions were found to improve depression symptoms more than usual care alone and results may be comparable to those of group cognitive behavioral therapy. These findings suggest that peer support interventions have the potential to be effective components of depression care, and they support the inclusion of peer support in recovery-oriented mental health treatment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.preparedpatientforum.org/research/support_021711.pdf Pfeiffer PN, Heisler M, Piette JD, Rogers MAM, Valenstein M. "Efficacy of peer support interventions for depression: a meta-analysis"]. ''General Hospital Psychiatry,'' 2011;2011(33):29-36.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2013 [[Senator Patty Murray]], Chairman of the [[United States Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs]], sponsored an amendment of the [[National Defense Authorization Act]] (S.3254) that would require peer counseling as part of a comprehensive [[suicide prevention]] program for US veterans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.murray.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/newsreleases?ID=5473049d-09d6-41ac-a578-1304b9ce19d3 "MILITARY SUICIDE: Murray Effort to Create Standardized Suicide Prevention Program Signed into Law by President Obama."]&lt;/ref&gt;

====For veterans with PTSD====

Researchers at the [http://www.paloalto.va.gov Palo Alto VA] [http://www.ptsd.va.gov/public/treatment/cope/peer_support_groups.asp National Center for PTSD] reviewed the literature on peer interventions for [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|PTSD]] and found that studies fell into three broad categories, referred to as "peer outreach for those exposed to traumatic events;” “paraprofessional peer delivery of a trauma-focused intervention” and “peer support for recovery from PTSD".&lt;ref&gt;Jain S, McLean C, Adler EP, Lindley, SE, Ruzek, JI, Rosen CS. "Does the Integration of Peers into the Treatment of Adults with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Improve Access to Mental Health Care? A Literature Review and Conceptual Model." ''J Trauma Stress Disor Treat.'' 2013 Aug; 2:3&lt;/ref&gt; Peer support outreach for those exposed to traumatic events refers to programs that seek to identify and reach out to those suffering from or at risk for mental health problems following a traumatic event as a means of connecting those people to mental health services. Paraprofessional peers are defined as having a shared background as the target population and work closely with and supplement the services of the mental healthcare team. These peers are trained in certain interventions (such as [[Psychological First Aid]]) and are closely supervised by professional mental healthcare personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McCabe|first1=O. Lee|last2=Perry|first2=Charlene|last3=Azur|first3=Melissa|last4=Taylor|first4=Henry G.|last5=Bailey|first5=Mark|last6=Links|first6=Johnathan M.|title=Psychological first aid training for paraprofessionals: A systems-based model for enhancing capacity of rural emergency responses.|journal=Prehospital and Disaster Medicine|date=2011|volume=26|issue=4|pages=251–258|doi=10.1017/s1049023x11006297}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Peer support for recovery from PTSD refers to programs in which someone with lived experience of PTSD, who experienced a significant reduction in symptoms, provides formal services to those who have not yet made significant steps in recovery from his or her condition. The peer support for recovery model focuses on improvement in overall health and wellness, and has long been successful in the treatment of SMI (serious mental illness) but is relatively new for PTSD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sledge|first1=W.

A further review of existing literature found that carefully recruited, trained, supervised, and supported paraprofessionals can deliver mental health interventions effectively, and may be valuable in communities with fewer resources for mental healthcare.&lt;ref&gt;Jain S. "The role of paraprofessionals in providing treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder in low-resource communities." ''Journal of the American Medical Association.'' 2010 Aug; 304:5&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers at the Palo Alto VA National Center for PTSD also conducted [[focus groups]] at the [[VA Palo Alto Health Care System]] Trauma Recovery Programs, a PTSD Residential Rehabilitation Program, and a Women's Trauma Recovery Program to determine veteran and staff perceptions of informal peer support interventions already in place.&lt;ref&gt;Jain S, McLean C, &amp; Rosen C. "Is there a role for peer support delivered interventions in the treatment of veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder?" ''Military Medicine.'' 2012; 177:5&lt;/ref&gt; Four themes were identified, including "peer support contributing to a feeling of social connectedness," "positive role modeling by the peer support provider," "peer support augmenting care offered by professional providers," and "peer supporter acting as a 'culture broker' and orienting recipients to mental health treatment."

These findings have been put into practice through a peer support program for veterans in the Sonora, Stockton, and Modesto VA outpatient clinics. The clinics are part of the Palo Alto Veterans Affairs Healthcare System that extend to more rural parts of northern California. The program is funded through grants in support of new treatment approaches to serve veterans in rural, traditionally underserved areas. Leadership for the program comes from the Menlo Park division of the Palo Alto VA system.

The peer support program has been operational since 2012 with over 268 unique veterans seen between 2012 and 2015. The two peer support providers involved in the program are veterans of the Vietnam and Iraq wars, respectively, and after having recovered from their own mental health disorders utilize their experiences to help their fellow veterans. The two providers have been responsible for leading between 5 and 7 groups each week as well as conducting telephone outreach and one-on-one engagement visits &lt;ref&gt;Joseph, K. M., Hernandez, J. M., &amp; Jain, S. (2015). Peer support telephone outreach intervention for veterans with PTSD. Psychiatric Services, 66(9), 1001&lt;/ref&gt; These services have successfully helped to augment the often overburdened mental health treatment teams at the central valley outpatient VA clinics.

The peer support program has been described in several publications. A personal story of success was featured in [http://stanmed.stanford.edu/2014fall/the-buddy-system.html Stanford Medicine magazine] and the collaborative nature of the program was described in the recently published book, [https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319188836 Partnerships for Mental Health].

===For sex workers===
Several peer based organisations exist for [[sex workers]]. The aim of these organisations is to support the health, rights and well being of sex workers and advocate on their behalf for law reform in order to make working safer. Sex work is work and there are many people who willingly choose it as a job/career. While sex trafficking does exist, not everyone who does sex work is doing so under duress. Social stigma is a major hurdle sex workers encounter, with many people trying to 'save' them. Peer support workers and peer educators are seen as best practice by the [[Sex Industry Network (SIN)]] when engaging with community members because peers can understand that someone could willingly choose to do sex work.

'''Project Hope Palestine''' ('''H'''umanitarian '''O'''pportunities for '''P'''eace and '''E'''ducation) is a UK registered non-governmental organisation providing free educational and recreational programmes for children in and around the city of [[Nablus]], in the northern part of the [[State of Palestine]], some 63km north of [[Jerusalem]]. It is thought to be the largest organisation of its kind in the West Bank.

==History==
Project Hope was established in 2003 at the height of the [[Second Palestinian Intifada]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merip.or/primer-palestine-israel-arab-israeli-conflict-new Israeli military occupation]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was co-founded by three Nablus-born locals, Hakim Sabbah, Salem Hantoli and Samah Atout, together with Canadian Jeremy Wildeman who while volunteering in West Bank education in 2002 was caught up in the violence. He returned to Nablus in 2003 to help address the humanitarian crisis in his own way, by addressing the severe educational and opportunity deficiencies youth faced there.  As Wildeman later told the Toronto Star,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/news/2009/06/19/bringing_hope_to_palestinians.html the Toronto Star]&lt;/ref&gt; he returned with nothing more than an idea, and a group of volunteers. His idea was to provide educational opportunities to children who because of the humanitarian crisis caused by the conflict were being denied their basic rights under the [[United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child]] 1989 to 'learn, thrive and grow' in a safe and supportive environment.  He teamed up with three Nablus residents to fulfil this aim according to their shared vision.  Samah Atout spent her formative years as a university student enduring the horrors of the Second Intifada and wanted to do something for her community - led ''by the community'' rather than by donors with often conflicting political agendas.  Hakim Sabeh emphasised the cultural aspects of educational work in Nablus, as well as providing classes open to as many communities as possible in the Nablus Governate, including the [[refugee camps]] and villages surrounding [[Nablus]].  According to [http://orgs.tigweb.org Project Hope's mission statement] their aim is to support and empower Palestinian youth through learning, the same principle that guides the work today.

== Volunteers ==
In 2013 Project Hope hosted 144 international volunteers from 19 countries, the majority from the United States, France and Britain.  This represents a 57% increase over 2011. &lt;ref&gt;[http://projecthope.ps/organizational-news/2013-annual-report/]&lt;/ref&gt; Volunteers are required to contribute to the cost of shared accommodation in houses belonging to the charity. All volunteers undergo induction before teaching or setting up workshops and summer camps. Local volunteers are key to supporting overseas teams in the classroom and other activities. 

== Programmes ==
The charity, led by co-founder and Director Hakim Sabeh, is said to be the largest non-governmental organisation of its kind in the West Bank. It employs locally engaged staff to manage and administer the programmes.  Depending on demand, classes and workshops typically focus on languages (English and French), information technology and the arts, including drama and photography. They take place in community settings in partnership with schools, community centres and village halls. In 2013 there were 69 such local partners. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.projecthope.ps/organizational-news/2013-annual-report/]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Funding ==
Project Hope is funded by overseas grants and donations.

== Project Hope and Firefly International ==
In 2013, Project Hope Palestine entered into partnership with the Scottish-registered charity Firefly International, &lt;ref name=FI&gt;[http://fireflyinternational.org/ Firefly International]&lt;/ref&gt; which supports a locally-run educational project similar to Project Hope - Svitac, meaning firefly - in the northeast of [[Bosnia]].  Both projects work with large numbers of children in war-torn areas, on modest budgets.  Jeremy Wildeman was appointed interim Director of Firefly International in June 2014.&lt;ref name=FI /&gt;

'''Remedial education''' (also known as developmental education, basic skills education, compensatory education, preparatory education, and academic upgrading) is assigned to assist students in order to achieve expected competencies in core academic skills such as literacy and numeracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2018-02-20/researchers-unsure-which-remedial-education-models-work-best-for-students|title=Which Remedial Education Models Work Best for Students?|last=|first=|date=February 20, 2018|work=[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]|access-date=September 9, 2018|agency=The Hechinger Report}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas [[special education]] is designed specifically for students with [[special needs]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Higbee|first=Jeanne L.|date=Spring 1993|title=Developmental Versus Remedial: More than Semantics|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/42801906|journal=Research and Teaching in Developmental Education|volume=9|issue=2|pages=99-107}}&lt;/ref&gt;, remedial education can be designed for any students, with or without special needs;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Winner|first=Ellen|date=October 1997|title=Exceptionally High Intelligence and Schooling|url=https://doi.org/10.1037/0003-066x.52.10.1070|journal=American Psychologist|volume=52|issue=10|pages=1070–1081|doi=10.1037/0003-066x.52.10.1070|issn=1935-990X|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the defining trait is simply that they have reached a point of lack of preparedness, regardless of why. For example, even people of high [[intelligence]] can be under-prepared if their education was disrupted,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hamre|first=Bridget K.|last2=Pianta|first2=Robert C.|date=March 2001|title=Early Teacher-Child Relationships and the Trajectory of Children's School Outcomes through Eighth Grade|url=https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-8624.00301|journal=Child Development|language=en|volume=72|issue=2|pages=625–638|doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00301|issn=0009-3920|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example, by [[internally displaced person|internal displacement]] during [[civil disorder]] or a [[war]]. 

== In Canada ==
In [[Canada]], the process whereby mature students take secondary school courses so that they can qualify to take post-secondary education is called academic upgrading&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lambtoncollege.ca/Services/Academic_Upgrading/What_is_Academic_Upgrading_/|title=What is Academic Upgrading?|last=|first=|date=|website=[[Lambton College]]|publisher=|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=July 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The [[Workers' Compensation Board]] of Nova Scotia defines academic upgrading as "programs offered to adult learners who require the academic pre-requisites needed for entry into many occupational programs."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wcb.ns.ca/wcbns/index_e.aspx?DetailId=771&lt;/ref&gt; The Alberta Ministry of Enterprise and Advanced Education advises that academic upgrading can be pursued through a post-secondary institution, a [[school board]] program such as a [[storefront school]], or via [[distance learning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://advancededucation.alberta.ca/planning/choosing/upgrading.aspx|title=Upgrading|last=|first=|date=|website=Advanced Education|publisher=Government of [[Alberta]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=September 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the United States ==

Postsecondary remediation is delivered on both 2-year community college and 4-year university campuses in the U.S. The bulk of remedial courses focus on advancing underprepared students' literacy skills (English and reading) or math skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Perin|first=Dolores|title=Literacy Skills Among Academically Underprepared Students|url=http://crw.sagepub.com/content/41/2/118.abstract|publisher=Community College Research Center|accessdate=October 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, remedial courses can also be offered for other subjects such as science or study skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Paramore|first=Tricia|title=Developmental/Remedial Sciences at Community Colleges in Five States in the Central Part of the United States|url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1003&amp;context=cehsedaddiss|publisher=University of Nebraska|accessdate=October 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Student placement ===

Many students are placed into remedial courses through placement tests such as the [[ACT (test)|ACT]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.act.org/|title=Home|website=ACT|language=en|access-date=2018-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[SAT]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat|title=SAT|date=2016-11-28|work=SAT Suite of Assessments|access-date=2018-07-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, ACCUPLACER&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://accuplacer.collegeboard.org/|title=Welcome to ACCUPLACER – The College Board|website=accuplacer.collegeboard.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;, or COMPASS assessments&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.acer.org/compass|title=Overview|work=Australian Council for Educational Research - ACER|access-date=2018-07-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Often, each college or university sets its own score thresholds for determining whether a student must enroll in remedial courses. However, some states are moving toward a uniform standard for remedial placement cut scores. Students are required to enroll in remedial courses before advancing to a college level course in that subject. Colleges review a student's score by subject - math, English, science, etc. - and compare that score to the school's cutoff.&lt;ref name="Crosta"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccrc.tc.columbia.edu/publications/predicting-success-placement-tests-transcripts.html|title=Predicting Success in College: The Importance of Placement Tests and High School Transcripts|last=Crosta|first=Peter|date=February 2012|website=Community College Research Center|publisher=[[Columbia University]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=November 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a college might use a score of 19 on the ACT math section as the threshold for determining whether a student must enroll in a remedial math course or college-level math course.

Particularly at [[Community college|community colleges]] – which are open enrollment to any student with a high school degree&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/05/education/learning/community-colleges-middle-class-families.html|title=Middle-Class Families Increasingly Look to Community Colleges|access-date=2018-07-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[GED]] – multiple semesters of remedial coursework may be available to and required of students that enter with low placement test scores&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.acenet.edu/news-room/Pages/GED-Testing-Service.aspx|title=GED Testing Service|website=www.acenet.edu|access-date=2018-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Whether placement tests are the most effective method of placing students is an open debate across the US. Some colleges and states are experimenting with using high school [[GPA]] ''and'' placement test scores to determine student course referral. A study of placement tests by the [[Community College Research Center]] in 2012 found:''&lt;ref name="Crosta" /&gt;'' 

{{Quote|text=Placement test scores are not especially good predictors of course grades in developmental education classes. More importantly, the tests do not have much explanatory power across a range of measures of performance including college GPA, credit accumulation, and success in gatekeeper English and math classes.|sign=|source=Clive Belfield and Peter M. Crosta}}

Using GPA with standardized test scores may also improve the accuracy of remedial placement and limit the likelihood of placing students into additional remedial courses they may not need. North Carolina recently implemented a statewide policy that allows two-year colleges to use both placement test scores and high school GPA to place students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Morrissey|first=Sharon|title=State Board of Community Colleges Placement Policies|url=http://www.successnc.org/sites/default/files/inititiative-docs/SBCC%20Placement%20Policies.pdf|publisher=North Carolina Community College System|accessdate=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Student enrollment ===

Estimates on the portion of students in higher education taking remedial courses vary. At two-year colleges the percentage reported of students taking at least 1 remedial course varies from 41% to as high as 60%.&lt;ref name="Ross"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ross|first=Terri|title=Higher Education: Gaps in Access and Persistence Study|url=http://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/pubsinfo.asp?pubid=2012046|publisher=National Center for Education Statistics|accessdate=November 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lu|first=Adrienne|title=States Reform College Remedial Education|url=http://www.pewstates.org/projects/stateline/headlines/states-reform-college-remedial-education-85899492704|publisher=Pew Charitable Trusts|accessdate=November 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students from low-income households, [[African Americans|African American]] students and [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic]] students are more likely to enroll in remedial courses.&lt;ref name="Ross"/&gt; National estimates show that among two-year college students, students age 17-19 are most likely to enroll in remedial courses followed by students age 20-24 and then students age 25+.&lt;ref name="Complete College America"&gt;{{cite web|title=Remediation: Higher Education's Bridge to Nowhere|url=http://www.completecollege.org/docs/CCA-Remediation-final.pdf|publisher=Complete College America|accessdate=November 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The likelihood of remedial placement varies among states because of high school preparation, student demographics and state policies for assessing and placing students in remedial courses. Previous proportions of recent high school graduates enrolling in remedial courses at [[Two-year college|two-year colleges]] range from over 70% in [[Tennessee]] to 31% in [[North Carolina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Time in the Enemy: Part 2 Results from States|url=http://completecollege.org/docs/Time_Is_the_Enemy_Tables.pdf|publisher=Complete College America, pg 18|accessdate=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proportion of students enrolling in remedial courses on public, four-year college campuses is generally lower ranging from 35% in South Dakota to 5% in Washington state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Time in the Enemy: Part 2 Results from States|url=http://completecollege.org/docs/Time_Is_the_Enemy_Tables.pdf|publisher=Complete College America, pg 19|accessdate=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The state of [[Colorado]] issued a [http://highered.colorado.gov/Publications/Reports/Remedial/FY2012/2012_Remedial_relmay09.pdf 2012 report] on remedial placement showing that 40% of recent high school students enrolled in remedial courses at both two-year and 4- year colleges. Sixty-six (66%)of students enrolled in a two-year college and 24% of students at a four-year institution needed remediation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Garcia|first=Joseph|title=2012 LEGISLATIVE REPORT ON REMEDIAL EDUCATION|url=http://highered.colorado.gov/Publications/Reports/Remedial/FY2012/2012_Remedial_relmay09.pdf|publisher=Colorado Department of Higher Education|accessdate=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Educators and researchers also question whether many of the students directed into remediation ultimately need the course work, and some studies have found that the current method of using placement tests to assign students to remedial courses may be related to over placement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sparks|first=Sarah|title=Many Students Don't Need Remediation, Studies Say|url=http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2013/02/20/21remediation_ep.h32.html|accessdate=November 29, 2013|newspaper=Education Week|date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Course delivery ===

There is an active debate on how remedial courses should be delivered to students&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ecs.force.com/mbdata/MBQuestNB2?Rep=DE1509N|title=Students May Take Developmental/Remedial Courses Through Dual Enrollment Program|website=ecs.force.com|access-date=2018-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Students that are placed into remedial courses hold differing skill levels and needs for support. There is an active debate on whether students that are on the upper end of the skill spectrum may be most successful bypassing remedial coursework and enrolling in college-level courses with additional tutoring (see National Efforts to Strengthen Remediation). In contrast, students with larger skill deficiencies may require substantial math and English instruction before they can succeed academically. Researchers continue to investigate and make recommendations for effective remedial education models.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/education-k-12/reports/2016/09/28/144000/remedial-education/|title=Remedial Education|last=Jimenez|first=Laura|date=September 28, 2016|work=Center for American Progress|access-date=July 5, 2018|last2=Morales|first2=Jessica|language=en-US|last3=Thompson|first3=Maggie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, remedial education courses are delivered many ways across the United States: 
#Traditional, semester-long courses;
#Cohort models that group a class of students together in a series of remedial courses;
#Placing students in college-level courses with mandated tutoring or supplementary instruction;
#Modularized courses that target particularly student skills;
#Intensive, compressed courses that accelerate student readiness;
#Courses that integrate remedial content with occupational skills;
#Self-guided computer based courses that adapt to student skill deficiencies;
#Online, in computer-based, traditional semester model.

In 2011, a nonprofit did a review of studies on remedial education delivery and found that, "programs that show the greatest benefits with relatively rigorous documentation either mainstream developmental students into college-level courses with additional supports, provide modularized or compressed courses to allow remedial students to more quickly complete their developmental work, or offer contextualized remedial education within occupational and vocational programs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rutschow|first=Elizabeth, and Emily Schneider|title=Unlocking the Gate What We Know About Improving Developmental Education|url=http://www.mdrc.org/sites/default/files/full_595.pdf|publisher=MDRC|accessdate=December 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accelerating the pace at which students progress through remedial courses is a reform now regularly highlighted in academic research and advocacy as effective for increasing student success. Often, remedial courses do not count toward a student's graduation requirements and taking many semesters of remedial education can lengthen a student's path to graduation and take up much needed financial aid. The [[Community College Research Center]] has found that accelerating a student's remedial English requirements resulted a higher likelihood of students completing their remedial sequences, a higher likelihood of enrolling in college-level English courses and a higher likelihood of students receiving a 'C' or better in the college-level course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccrc.tc.columbia.edu/media/k2/attachments/designing-meaningful-developmental-reform-research-overview.pdf|title=Designing Meaningful Developmental Education Reform|last=|first=|date=|website=Community College Research Center|publisher=[[Columbia University]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Online Courses: Some colleges have explored the use of providing remedial education courses online for students; however, evidence indicates that completion of online remedial courses is lower across almost every group of students compared to in-person remedial instruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jaggars|first=Shanna|title=Successful Remedial Education Reform Strategies|url=http://ccrc.tc.columbia.edu/media/k2/attachments/successful-remedial-education-strategies.pdf|publisher=Community College Research Center|accessdate=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also evidence that students enrolling in online remedial education are less likely than their in-person counterparts to continue on to college-level coursework in the same subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jaggars|first=Shanna|title=Student Success Challenges n Three Areas: Developmental Education, Online Learning, and the Structure of the Student Experience|url=http://ccrc.tc.columbia.edu/media/k2/attachments/student-success-challenges-three-areas.pdf|publisher=Community College Research Center|accessdate=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The methods for delivering remedial education and whether to deliver remedial education are active debates in the U.S. As Bahr (Bahr 2008a, pp.&amp;nbsp;420–421) explains, "On one hand, it fills an important niche in U.S. higher education by providing opportunities to rectify disparities generated in primary education and secondary schooling, to develop the minimum skills deemed necessary for functional participation in the economy and the democracy, and to acquire the prerequisite competencies that are crucial for negotiating college-level coursework. On the other hand, critics argue that taxpayers should not be required to pay twice for the same educational opportunities, that remediation diminishes academic standards and devalues post-secondary credentials, and that the large number of underprepared students entering colleges and universities demoralizes faculty. Following from these critiques, some have argued for a major restructuring of remediation or even the elimination of remedial programs altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nordan.daynal.org/wiki/index.php?title=Remedial|title=Remedial - DaynalWiki|website=nordan.daynal.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;"

=== Research on outcomes ===

Depending on their skill level upon entering college, students can spend from 1 to multiple semesters working to fulfill remedial requirements before advancing to college level courses required for their degree. An example of a full sequence of math remedial courses for low-skill students might include: 1) Pre-Collegiate Math, 2) Basic Algebra, and 3) Intermediate Algebra.&lt;ref name="Bailey"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bailey|first=Thomas |author2=Dong Wook Jeong |author3=Sung-Woo Cho|title=Referral, enrollment and completion in developmental education sequences in community colleges|journal=Economics of Education Review|date=Spring 2010|volume=29|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many questions about how this structure both benefits students by increasing their preparation and harms students by increasing the courses required and time needed to complete college. Thomas Bailey from the [[Community College Research Center]] describes this in a 2010 report:''&lt;ref name="Bailey"/&gt;'' 

{{Quote|text=For example, those with the greatest need for developmental math may be expected to enroll in and pass pre-collegiate math or arithmetic, basic algebra, and intermediate algebra, in order to prepare them forcollege-level algebra.|sign=|source=}}

Complete College America, a national non-profit working on remedial education reform&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://completecollege.org/|title=Homepage - Complete College America|website=Complete College America|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;, reports that among remedial students at two-year colleges 62% complete their remedial course and 23% complete associated college-level courses in that subject within 2 year (for example, complete math remediation and the college-level math requirements for their degree). On 4-year college campuses, 74% of students in remedial courses complete the course, and 37% complete remediation and an associated college-level course in that subject within 2 years.&lt;ref name="Complete College America"/&gt; The same report projects that 9.5% of two-year college students starting in remediation will graduate within 3 years, and 35.1% of 4-year college students starting in remedial courses will graduate within 6 years.

Similarly, a nationwide study of two year college students participating in remedial education found 46% of students referred to remedial reading and 33% of students in math remediation completed their remedial sequence. A substantial portion of these non-completing students – 29% in math and 16% in reading – did so because they did not pass their remedial course.&lt;ref name="Bailey"/&gt; Another 11% of math students and 9% of reading students exited college without ever having failed or completed a remedial course. Students that enrolled in college and were placed into a sequence of 3 or more remedial courses were the least likely to persist to a college-level course. Like in all education pathways, there are many different points at which remedial students can step out of education. Research from the [[Community College Research Center]] at Colombia University suggests that many students do not complete their remedial sequences or do not enroll in the first college-level course in that subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ccrc.tc.columbia.edu/|title=Community College Research Center|work=Community College Research Center|access-date=2018-07-05|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== National efforts ===

Over the last several years, a large amount of philanthropic and research attention has been directed at remedial education programs&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.understood.org/en/learning-attention-issues/treatments-approaches/educational-strategies/remedial-programs-what-you-need-to-know|title=Remedial Programs: What You Need to Know|work=Understood.org|access-date=2018-07-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Often, focus on remedial education is directed at 1) increasing the successful completion of remedial sequences 2) increasing the overall number of students with college degrees and certificates in the US and 3) decreasing the cost of remedial education to colleges and states&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gadoe.org/Curriculum-Instruction-and-Assessment/Curriculum-and-Instruction/Pages/Remedial-Education-Program.aspx|title=Remedial Education Program (REP)|website=www.gadoe.org|language=en-us|access-date=2018-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==== Complete College America ====
A national non-profit organization, Complete College America (CCA), was established in 2009 and looks at paths to improving higher education outcomes for all students. The organization has provided large amounts of national data on the proportion of students enrolled in remedial courses across demographic groups. The organization has also worked with states to set goals for increasing college completion and making adjustments to higher education policies. Currently, CCA heavily promotes enrolling more students directly into college-level courses even though they would traditionally test into remedial courses. The organization also heavily promotes better aligning remedial courses with college-level courses, and using diverse measures of student academic standing for remedial placement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Game Changers: Corequisite Remediation|url=http://www.completecollege.org/gameChangers.html#clickBoxTan|publisher=Complete College America|accessdate=December 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Achieving the Dream ====
Originally an initiative led by the Lumina Foundation, Achieving the Dream focuses on increasing the success of college students – particularly students of color and students from low-income backgrounds. Starting in 2004 the project funded promising, data driven approaches to strengthening remedial education coursework. Today, Achieving the Dream is its own, national organization with the same driving [http://www.achievingthedream.org/about/mission_vision_and_values mission]: "Achieving the Dream is a national reform network dedicated to community college student success and completion; focused primarily on helping low-income students and students of color complete their education and obtain market-valued credentials." The organization continues to fund positive interventions that move underprepared students through remediation with greater success and features a list of best practices and exemplary colleges from which other higher education administrators can learn. Achieving the Dream promotes many different [http://www.achievingthedream.org/sites/default/files/resources/2011PromisingPractices_Developmental%20Education.pdf promising interventions] that can increase the success of students including: first-year student success courses that provide students with the skills to navigate college expectations/academics more effectively, accelerated remedial courses in math and English, student mentoring and coaching, mandatory orientations for new students and supplementary computer tutoring for remedial students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Achieving the Dream Results and College Promising Practices|url=http://www.achievingthedream.org/results/colleges|publisher=Achieving the Dream, Inc|accessdate=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Achieving the Dream also takes an active role in state policy advocacy and is currently working in 15 states to strengthen student remedial success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Achieving the Dream: State Policy Teams|url=http://www.achievingthedream.org/network/state_policy_teams|publisher=Achieving the Dream|accessdate=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Core Principles Statement ====

In December 2012, The Dana Center at the University of Texas, Complete College America, Education Commission of the States, and Jobs for the Future released "Core Principles for Transforming Remedial Education: A Joint Statement" with 7 key principles for strengthening community college remedial programs. The statement's principles included: aligning remedial courses with a student's long-term area of study at the college, using multiple measures to placement students in remedial courses, requiring all students –including under-prepared students– to pick a program of study when they enter college, integrating academic support services into pre college-level coursework, creating accelerated course models with students with larger skill deficiencies, and measuring completion of remedial courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1 Core Principles for Transforming Remedial Education: A Joint Statement|url=http://www.achievingthedream.org/sites/default/files/resources/Transforming%20Remedial%20Education.pdf|accessdate=November 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strategies that accelerate students through remedial coursework and on to college-level (also called gatekeeper) courses are widely promoted as one path to increasing the success of under-prepared students.&lt;ref name="Bailey"/&gt;

==== Changes in North Carolina ====

In 2012, North Carolina underwent a wide scale redesign of their remedial education programs.&lt;ref name="NC Community Colleges"&gt;{{cite web|title=SuccessNC Developmental Education Initiative|url=http://www.successnc.org/initiatives/developmental-education-initiative|publisher=NC Community Colleges|accessdate=December 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Branded as 'Success NC', the program's Developmental Education Initiative takes steps to redesign math and reading curricula, move students through remedial courses faster and better assess and place students. NC colleges can now incorporate high school grades into their course placement decisions. Additionally, starting in 2014, all colleges will deliver remedial reading &amp; English in 3 shorter, 8 week modules for some students while allowing higher level remedial students to enroll in college-level English courses with required supplementary English instruction.&lt;ref name="NC Community Colleges"/&gt;

==== Gates Foundation and Lumina Foundation ====

In 2009 the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation appropriated $16.5 million to 15 colleges in 5 states to promote promising interventions in the remedial education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Press Release: Community Colleges and States Selected to Boost College Graduation Rates - Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation|url=http://www.gatesfoundation.org/Media-Center/Press-Releases/2009/06/Community-Colleges-and-States-Selected-to-Boost-College-Graduation-Rates|accessdate=December 2, 2013|date=June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fueled by the broader goal of increasing the number of college graduates nationwide, the Gates Foundation promoted remedial interventions that proved successful, particularly low-income students and students of color, through the Lumina Foundation's ''Achieving the Dream Initiative''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Achieving the Dream Website|url=http://www.achievingthedream.org/|accessdate=December 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A host of findings, recommendations and best practices —-including 25 Steps to Effective Remedial Education—-from the Gates Foundation and Lumina Foundation investments are now available through the Development Education Initiative through Achieving the Dream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Developing Education Initiative Resources|url=http://www.deionline.org/resources/|publisher=MDC, Inc.|accessdate=December 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Europe ==

While remedial programmes are common in the [[United States]], they are less common in [[Europe]]. Nevertheless, several European [[higher education]] institutes have started to offer remedial education programmes as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Rienties|first=Bart|title=Longitudinal Study of Online Remedial Education Effects|date=2008|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-1-4020-8747-9_3|work=The Power of Technology for Learning|pages=43–59|publisher=Springer Netherlands|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-1-4020-8747-9_3|isbn=9781402087462|access-date=2018-09-09|last2=Tempelaar|first2=Dirk|last3=Dijkstra|first3=Joost|last4=Rehm|first4=Martin|last5=Gijselaers|first5=Wim}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the reasons why European universities are starting to develop remedial courses is the different situation in the two continents. In the [[United States]], a common assumption is that remediation attracts underprepared students of low [[socioeconomic status]]. Inadequate academic preparation is no longer a barrier to college access. In contrast, in Europe, a large part of the transitional problems are caused by differences among national [[secondary education|secondary educational programmes]], which are determined on a national level.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brants|first=Lotte|last2=Struyven|first2=Katrien|date=August 2009|title=Literature Review of Online Remedial Education|url=https://doi.org/10.5367/000000009789346112|journal=Industry and Higher Education|language=en|volume=23|issue=4|pages=269–275|doi=10.5367/000000009789346112|issn=0950-4222|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, these students are hindered to effectively start a [[bachelor]] or [[master's degree|master programme]]. Remedial or developmental courses can help to bridge the gap.

=== European Framework of Transitional Preparatory/Remedial Teaching ===
To be able to compare and assess various preparatory courses in [[Europe]], a European framework of transitional courses is necessary. By developing European Framework for Transitional Preparatory Courses (EFTPC), teachers around [[Europe]] can see how their design of their courses fit with the framework. In addition, potential improvements are identified and can be extended with the insights from the field. By using the [[WIKI]] [[technology]], each teacher can add his/her suggestions to the EFTPC. This Framework is being developed in frame of European project STEP (Studies on Transitional Electronic Programmes).

==In Asia==
===Taiwan and Mainland China===
Remedial education, also known as "buxiban" ({{zh|t=補習班|s=补习班|p=bǔxíbān}}, lit. "''remedial education classes''") are [[cram school]]s in [[Taiwan]] and [[Mainland China]].

It is a prevalent belief that parents should send their children to all kinds of cram schools in order for their children to remain competitive with their peers of the same age. As a result, many children of school-going age in Mainland China or Taiwan have schedules packed with all sorts of remediation from cram school.

''Buxiban'' teach a variety of subjects, including [[math]], [[Chinese characters]], and [[English as a foreign language]]. Studying at several ''buxiban'' is widely perceived as necessary to get a high-enough college entrance exam score to attend prestigious universities.

Some ''buxiban'' are located in English-speaking countries. Most of those in North America are operated by the local communities. There, they are equivalent to ''[[hoshū jugyō kō]]'' (''hoshūkō'') in ethnic Japanese communities and ''[[hagwon]]'' in ethnic Korean communities. ''Buxiban'' began appearing in North America in the 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;Hirvela, Alan. "Diverse Literacy Practices among Asian Populations: Implications for Theory and Pedagogy" (Chapter 5). In: Farr, Marcia, Lisya Seloni, and Juyoung Song (editors). ''Ethnolinguistic Diversity and Education: Language, Literacy and Culture''. [[Routledge]], January 25, 2011. Start page 99. {{ISBN|1135183708}}, 9781135183707. - Cited: p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=bHWMAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA103 103]. "These, too, exist as a result of efforts made by local ethnic communities. Chinese (buxiban) and Korean (hagwon) schools are the most dominant of these learning environments, while Japanese heritage schools (hoshuko) also exist in certain communities. The Chinese schools, which began appearing in the late 1880s, are mostly community run[...]"&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Harvard Educational Review]]'', 2006. 76 (1), 1-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effectiveness ==
The question that rises is whether successful completion of a remedial course guarantees students' success in college. The literature provides limited evidence for the [[effectiveness]] of remedial courses on outcomes such as: persistence to graduation, quality of performance in subsequent courses, drop-out, and grade point average. Many researchers claim that very little [[research]] has been conducted to investigate the [[effectiveness]] of remedial or developmental education and that [[research]] concerning the [[effectiveness]] of remedial education programs has been sporadic, underfunded, and inconclusive and has serious methodological flaws. Recently, efforts have been made to use more rigorous research designs (e.g. [[regression discontinuity design]]) to evaluate remedial effectiveness and suggest that post-remediation classroom composition (e.g., concentrated underpreparedness) moderates developmental education effectiveness efforts.&lt;ref name="Moss1"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Moss |first=B. G. |last2= Kelcey |first2=B. |last3=Showers |first3=N. | year= 2014 |title = Does Classroom Composition Matter? College Classrooms as Moderators of Developmental Education Effectiveness.| journal= [[Community College Review]] |volume=42 |issue=3 |pages= 201–220|doi= 10.1177/0091552114529153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Metrics ===
One way of measuring the effectiveness of a developmental/remedial program is to investigate whether the enrolled students actually complete the remedial courses successfully. Several research studies have found that underprepared students who completed remedial coursework achieve greater academic success than underprepared students who did not complete remedial coursework or students who started college academically prepared. Such findings support McCabe's statement that successfully-remediated students perform well in standard college work.&lt;ref name=" McCabe "&gt;{{cite journal |last= McCabe |first=R. | year= 2000 |title = No One to Waste: A Report to Public Decision-makers and Community College Leaders.| journal= Washington, DC: Community College Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the claim that a number of rigorous studies using a regression discontinuity design have found underprepared students who score near placement test cut off scores and enroll in remedial education perform no better than similarly scoring students who place directly into college level courses, several studies have demonstrated developmental education programs provide benefit.&lt;ref name="Jaggars, S.S 2014"&gt;Jaggars, S.S, Edgecombe, N., Stacey, G.W. (2014). What We know about Developmental Education Outcomes. Community College Research Center, Teachers College, Columbia University.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Moss"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Moss |first=B. G. |last2=Yeaton |first2=W. H. |last3=Lloyd |first3=J.E. | year= 2014 |title =Evaluating the Effectiveness of Developmental Mathematics by Embedding a Randomized Experiment Within a Regression Discontinuity Design.| journal= [[Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis]] |volume=36 |issue=2 |pages= 170–185|doi=10.3102/0162373713504988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This may in part be due to the "leakage" that often occurs from the beginning of a developmental program to its end. Research from the [[Community College Research Center]] indicates that even students who successfully complete a developmental class often drop out of school before entering credit programs &lt;ref name="Jaggars, S.S 2014"/&gt;

Acceleration Programs in Developmental Education

This has led to Acceleration in Developmental Education with The Community College of Baltimore County and the California Completion Project perhaps the two leading proponents. These programs merge (in different ways) developmental classes with credit classes.

=== Success factors ===
Kozeracki (2002)&lt;ref&gt;Kozeracki, C. A. (2002). ERIC review: Issues in developmental education. Community College Review, 29, 83-101.&lt;/ref&gt; distinguishes seven commonly cited elements that are associated with student success in developmental programs:

* Orientation, [[Educational assessment|assessment]], and placement are mandatory for new students
* Clearly specified goals and objectives are established for courses and programs
* The [[adult education|adult learning]] theory is applied in the design and delivery of the courses
* The courses are highly structured
* The programs are centralized or highly coordinated
* Counseling, [[tutor]]ing, and supplemental instruction components are included
* The social and emotional development of the students is taken into consideration

Other research suggests that "bridge" programs that integrate basic skills and remedial education with higher-level content or technical training can produce substantially better results than traditional remedial programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Online remedial education ==
[[Online and offline|Online]] remedial education is defined as an instruction method using [[Information and communication technologies|Information and communication technologies (ICT)]] which helps students to provide knowledge and skills necessary to succeed in university.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rienties|first=Bart|last2=Tempelaar|first2=Dirk|last3=Waterval|first3=Dominique|last4=Rehm|first4=Martin|last5=Gijselaers|first5=Wim|date=October 2006|title=Remedial Online Teaching on a Summer Course|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.5367/000000006778702300|journal=Industry and Higher Education|language=en|volume=20|issue=5|pages=327–336|doi=10.5367/000000006778702300|issn=0950-4222|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This way, foreign students can study in their home country, which reduces their costs while at the same time offering flexibility to develop their [[knowledge]] and [[skills]]. [[Information and communication technologies|ICT]] has the power to support independent learning as well as to learn irrespective of time and geographical constraints with the widespread implementation of [[internet]].

=== Advantages and disadvantages ===

Advantages and possibilities:
* Flexible instructional pace and flexible class participation
* Elimination of barriers of time and space
* Cost-effectiveness of online courses
* Electronic [[research]] availability (digital libraries and online databases)
* A well-designed online course makes it easy for students to navigate and find the adequate information

Disadvantages and problems:
* Delayed feedback from the instructor
* Unavailable technical support from the instructor
* Lack of self-regulation and self-motivation
* Sense of isolation, caused by the lack of [[interpersonal communication]] and [[Social interaction|interaction]] among students or between students and the instructor, or caused by the use of monotonous instructional methods
* A poorly designed course interface makes students feel lost in seeking information

=== Role of teachers ===
In order to provide a positive experience and to ensure the [[effectiveness]] of online remedial courses, the tutor's roles in designing and organizing the learning experience, providing technical advice and support, encouraging and facilitating discussion, encouraging participation, using a variety of forms of instruction, and resolving communication problems are crucial.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Collaborative tools ===
A recent development in collaborative working and learning is the use of synchronous tools like web-videoconferences whereby learners meet online at a fixed time (synchronous) in an online classroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Giesbers|first=Bas|last2=Rienties|first2=Bart|last3=Gijselaers|first3=Wim H.|last4=Segers|first4=Mien|last5=Tempelaar|first5=Dirk T.|date=August 2009|title=Social Presence, Web Videoconferencing and Learning in Virtual Teams|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.5367/000000009789346185|journal=Industry and Higher Education|language=en|volume=23|issue=4|pages=301–309|doi=10.5367/000000009789346185|issn=0950-4222|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While web-videoconferencing is not a new phenomenon, tools like [[Skype]], [[MSN Web Messenger]] and [[Adobe Acrobat Connect]] allow learners to efficiently communicate using free or low cost [[technology]] such as a simple desktop [[computer]]. Until recently, such basic [[technology]] would only allow for [[asynchronous learning]], as for example in discussion groups.

}}The '''Royal Academy of Engineering''' (RAEng) is the UK’s [[national academy]] of [[engineering]].

The Academy was founded in June 1976 as the '''Fellowship of Engineering''' with support from [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]], who became the first Senior Fellow and, {{As of|2018|lc=on}}, remains so. The Fellowship was incorporated and granted a [[Royal Charter]] on 17 May 1983 and became the Royal Academy of Engineering on 16 March 1992. It is governed according to the Charter and associated Statutes and Regulations (as amended from time to time).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RAEng: Charter, Statutes and Regulations|url=http://www.raeng.org.uk/publications/other/raeng-charter-statutes-regulations|accessdate=18 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmselect/cmsctech/774/77405.htm |title=The Royal Academy of Engineering |publisher=[[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] |date={{Format date|2002|9|1|df=yes}} |accessdate={{Format date|2012|12|5|df=yes}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Conceived in the late 1960s, during the Apollo space programme and [[Harold Wilson]]’s espousal of ‘[[white heat of technology]]’, the Fellowship of Engineering was born in the year of Concorde’s first commercial flight.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishairways.com/concorde/aboutconcorde.html#facts_figures Celebrating Concorde]. Britishairways.com. Retrieved on 2013-08-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fellowship's first meeting, at Buckingham Palace on 11 June 1976, enrolled 126 of the UK’s leading engineers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.raeng.org.uk/about/fellowship/founder_fellows/default.htm |title=Founder Fellows |publisher=Royal Academy of Engineering |date={{Format date|1976|6|10|df=yes}} |accessdate={{Format date|2012|12|5|df=yes}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first fellows included [[Frank Whittle|Air Commodore Sir Frank Whittle]], the jet engine genius,the structural engineer [[Ove Arup|Sir Ove Arup]], radar pioneer [[George G. Macfarlane|Sir George MacFarlane]], the inventor of the bouncing bomb, [[Barnes Wallis|Sir Barnes Wallis]], father of the UK computer industry [[Maurice Wilkes|Sir Maurice Wilkes]]. The Fellowship’s first President, [[Christopher Hinton, Baron Hinton of Bankside|Lord Hinton]], had driven the UK’s supremacy in nuclear power.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.raeng.org.uk/about/history/earlydays.htm History of The Academy - Early Days]. Raeng.org.uk (1976-06-11). Retrieved on 2013-08-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fellowship focused on championing excellence in all fields of engineering. Activities began in earnest in the mid-1970s with the Distinction lecture series, now known as the Hinton lectures. The Fellowship was asked to advise the Department of Industry for the first time and the Academy became host and presenter of the MacRobert Award.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.raeng.org.uk/about/history/establish.htm History of The Academy - 1976–1981: Establishing a track record]. Raeng.org.uk. Retrieved on 2013-08-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, the Fellowship received its own Royal Charter along with its first government grant-in-aid. At the same time it also received significant industrial funding, initiated its research programme to build bridges between academia and industry and opened its doors to International and Honorary Fellows.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.raeng.org.uk/about/history/growing.htm History of The Academy - 1981–1986: Growing influence and activities]. Raeng.org.uk. Retrieved on 2013-08-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, the Academy launched its first major initiative in education, Engineering Education Continuum, which evolved into the BEST Programme&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20020218224550/http://www.raeng.org.uk/education/best.htm] &lt;/ref&gt; and Shape the Future and Tomorrow's Engineers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071011212837/http://www.raeng.org.uk/education/stf/default.htm] &lt;/ref&gt;

The Academy’s increasing level of influence – in policy, research and education – was recognised when it was granted a royal title and became The Royal Academy of Engineering in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.raeng.org.uk/about/history/fromfellow.htm History of The Academy - 1991–1996: From Fellowship to Royal Academy].

==The Logo==
The Academy’s current logo is inspired by the Neolithic hand-axe, humans' first technological advance, which was taken to be a symbol appropriate to the Academy, supposedly representative of the ever-changing relationship between humanity and technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.raeng.org.uk/about/housestyle/default.htm Visual Identity Guidelines].

==Activities==
The Academy is instrumental in two policy alliances set up in 2009 to provide coherent advice on engineering education and policy across the profession: Education for Engineering&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.educationforengineering.org.uk/|title=Education for Engineering (E4E)|website=Education for Engineering (E4E)|accessdate=7 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Engineering the Future''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engineeringthefuture.co.uk|title=Engineering the Future|website=Engineering the Future|accessdate=7 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Academy is one of four agencies that receives funding from the UK's Department for Business Innovation &amp; Skills for activities that support government policy on public understanding of science and engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/2010-to-2015-government-policy-public-understanding-of-science-and-engineering/2010-to-2015-government-policy-public-understanding-of-science-and-engineering|title=2010 to 2015 government policy: public understanding of science and engineering|website=Gov.uk|accessdate=7 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of its programme to communicate the benefits and value of engineering to society, the Academy publishes a quarterly magazine, Ingenia[https://web.archive.org/web/20150924034924/http://www.ingenia.org.uk/Online]. The Academy says that Ingenia is written for a non-specialist audience and is "aimed at all those with an interest in engineering, whether working in business and industry, government, academia or the financial community". The Academy also makes Ingenia available to A-Level students in 3,000 schools in the UK. 

==Diversity==
The Academy strives to ensure that the pool of candidates for election to The Fellowship better reflects the diverse make-up of society as a whole. It set up the Proactive Membership Committee&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://raeng.org.uk/about/fellowship/council/pro_active_membership.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111213172155/http://raeng.org.uk/about/fellowship/council/pro_active_membership.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=13 December 2011|title=Council and Committees: Proactive Membership Committee|date=13 December 2011|accessdate=7 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2008 to identify and support the nomination of candidates from underrepresented areas, with the aim of boosting the number of women candidates, engineers from industry and Small and Medium Enterprises, those from emerging technologies and ethnically diverse backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.raeng.org.uk/about/fellowship/council/pro_active_membership.htm Council and Committees: Proactive Membership Committee] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111213172155/http://raeng.org.uk/about/fellowship/council/pro_active_membership.htm |date=2011-12-13 }}. Raeng.org.uk. Retrieved on 2013-08-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Ruchoma Herman was born on New York's [[Lower East Side]] to Rabbi Yaakov Yosef and Aidel Herman.&lt;ref name=matzav/&gt;&lt;ref name=hamodia&gt;{{cite news|last=Borchardt|first=F.|date=March 2013|title=Rebbetzin Ruchoma Shain, a”h|url=http://hamodia.com/2013/03/17/rebbetzin-ruchoma-shain-ah/|newspaper=[[Hamodia]]|access-date=October 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ynet/&gt; She was the youngest of her parents' five children.&lt;ref name=hamodia/&gt;&lt;ref name=jp/&gt; She had three sisters and one brother.&lt;ref name=jp/&gt;

When she was seventeen years old,&lt;ref name=jp/&gt; she married Moshe,&lt;ref name=hamodia/&gt;&lt;ref name=jp/&gt; eldest son of Rabbi Shimon and Geneshe Shain.&lt;ref name=hamodia/&gt; Shortly after their wedding, the couple, at the behest of her father,&lt;ref name=hamodia/&gt; traveled to [[Mir, Belarus]],&lt;ref name=hamodia/&gt; where they spent nearly six years while her husband studied at the [[Mir Yeshiva (Belarus)|Mir yeshiva]] under Rabbis [[Eliezer Yehuda Finkel (Mir rosh yeshiva, Poland and Jerusalem)|Eliezer Yehuda Finkel]], [[Yeruchom Levovitz]], and [[Yechezkel Levenstein]].&lt;ref name=hamodia/&gt; Her sister, Bessie, wife of Rabbi [[Chaim Pinchas Scheinberg]], and her brother, Rabbi Nochum Dovid, also joined them in Mir.&lt;ref name=matzav/&gt; Then they returned to the East Side. When their children were grown, the Shains moved to [[Jerusalem]], purchasing an apartment in the new development of [[Kiryat Mattersdorf]].&lt;ref name=hamodia/&gt; 

In the United States, Shain taught several grades. In Jerusalem, she was a popular lecturer.&lt;ref name=hamodia/&gt; After the publication of her books, Shain received visitors seeking her counsel regarding various topics.&lt;ref name=hamodia/&gt;

Shain wrote her first book, ''All for the Boss'', in her late sixties upon the request of Yaakov Feldheim, one of the founders of [[Feldheim Publishers]]. Published in 1984, her book about growing up in [[New York City]] and the influence of her father became one of the all-time bestsellers for the publishing company,&lt;ref name=heller&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jewishwriting.com/pages/95.pdf|title=Will it Sell in New York?|first=Esther|last=Heller|page=22|work=[[Mishpacha]]|date=15 February 2006|accessdate=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which until then had concentrated on Torah and rabbinic literature. ''All for the Boss'' was revised and expanded in 2001,&lt;ref name=jp/&gt; and Feldheim published a "Young Readers Edition" in 2006. Feldheim translated the book into Hebrew in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.il/books?id=6jwpNQEACAAJ|title=הכל לאדון הכל|language=Hebrew|publisher=Feldheim Publishers|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 a ''[[Ynet]]'' reporter called the book "one of the most read, talked about, and widely studied in the [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] street".&lt;ref name=ynet&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-3897781,00.html|title=לא תמצאו בדוכנים: המלצות לספרות חרדית|language=Hebrew|trans-title=You Won't Find it in the Stalls: Recommendations of Haredi Books|first=Eliezer|last=Heivan|date=2 June 2010|accessdate=20 October 2016|work=[[Ynet]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shain went on to write four more books, drawing on her personal and teaching experiences.

About ten years before her death, she returned to the United States to be near her children in [[Adelphia, New Jersey]], where she continued to welcome visitors.&lt;ref name=hamodia/&gt; She died in 2013 at [[Lakewood Township, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name=hamodia/&gt;

Her children are Rabbi Yisrael Meir Shain, Mrs. Mashi Wilner, and Rabbi Refoel Yitzchak Shain.&lt;ref name=hamodia/&gt;

In fact, [[practical joke]]s play such a significant part in student culture that numerous books have been published that solely focus on the issue of student pranks.&lt;ref&gt;Nightwork: A History of Hacks and Pranks at MIT by T.F. Peterson (Paperback - 1 April 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;If at All Possible, Involve a Cow: The Book of College Pranks by Neil Steinberg (Paperback - 1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

In some university towns, misbehaviour on the part of students became such an issue that a report has been released which studies the issue. The report, ''Studentification: A Guide to Opportunities, Challenges and Practice'', by Universities UK, focuses on six British universities as case studies.

==Theft==

One classic target of student theft are [[traffic cone]]s. The issue of the theft and misuse of traffic cones by students has gained enough prominence that a spokesperson from the [[National Union of Students (United Kingdom)|UK National Union of Students]] has been forced to argue that "stereotypes of students stealing traffic cones" are "outdated".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/4640168.stm|title=Rowdy students 'must be tackled'|date=24 January 2006|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=23 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some universities have gone as far as to devote entire pages of legislation and advice for students with regards to the consequences and laws involving the theft of traffic cones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worcsu.com/content/index.php?page=1362 |title=Worcester Students Union – The Home for Worcester University Students |accessdate=2007-07-19 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070505072538/http://www.worcsu.com/content/index.php?page=1362 |archivedate=May 5, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Misuse of traffic cones in [[Scotland]] has even resulted in serious physical injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/edinburgh_and_east/6163030.stm|title=Falling road cone injures student|date=19 November 2006|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=23 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The traffic cone theft issue came to such a head in the 1990s that it was brought up in parliament.&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199697/cmhansrd/vo961211/text/61211w15.htm House of Commons Hansard Written Answers for 11 Dec 1996 (pt 15)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, [[Fife]] Constabulary declared a "traffic cone amnesty" allowing [[University of St Andrews]] students to return stolen traffic cones without fear of prosecution. A police spokesman had said that the theft of traffic cones had become "an almost weekly occurrence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/2004218.stm|title=Students urged to cone clean|date=23 May 2002|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=23 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4802">'''The DO School''' is a platform that equips organizations and individuals to become purposeful doers who drive new products and powerful cultural shifts. Founded by renowned social entrepreneurs Florian Hoffmann and Katherin Kirschenmann in 2013, the DO School runs around 40 programs in over 27 countries for 7,000 participants. Since its inception The DO School has created more than 100 new products and services across multiple industries, impacting more than 3,000,000 lives. Clients include BMW, H&amp;M, Unilever, Covestro, Osram, Google, Hong Kong Jockey Club, the United Nations, and the City of New York.

== Programs ==

The DO School offers different training programs for emerging social entrepreneurs as well as established organizations. The programs vary in length, focus and target group.

=== Entrepreneurship for Good Program  ===

The DO School’s Entrepreneurship for Good Program empowers social entrepreneurs to launch their own social ventures. Students (known as Fellows in the context of the Entrepreneurship for Good Program) spend 10 weeks on a DO School campus completing a Challenge set by an organization while working through a curriculum built around the DO School Method for creating and implementing innovation. Previous challengers have included, among others, [[Messe Berlin]] and [[H&amp;M|H&amp;M Germany]]. Challenges focus on areas central to good business and innovation, e.g. sustainability, professional development or bottom billion business. By the end of the 10-week period, the Fellows present a solution to the given Challenge that should be ready to implement. In addition, they should have refined their venture idea and business plan. In the following 10 months of the program, Fellows work on setting up their social enterprises in their home countries, with guidance and support from the DO School team. The school currently accepts up to 80 students per year over four different programs.

=== Innovation Program ===

The Innovation Program is a three-week, on-campus program which invites aspiring social entrepreneurs to work on an innovation Challenge set by an organization. Using the DO School Method, Challenge participants co-create a concrete, hands-on solution, with or without involvement from the organizations’ employees. Unlike the Entrepreneurship for Good Program, this compact Challenge format does not involve a venture component during which participants work on launching their own start-up.

=== DO Camp ===

The DO Camp is an intensive 5-day workshop during which participants learn to use the DO School Method to take them from ideation to implementation. As of 2016, DO Camps have been announced for New York City, Phnom Penh and Singapore

=== Intrapreneurship Program ===
The Intrapreneurship Program is a four-month training program for organizations and their employees. It combines theoretical training sessions with practical work an internal Challenge set by that organization. The Intrapreneurship Program aims to teach employees the entrepreneurial and innovation skills they need to drive innovation within their companies while they simultaneously work on devising a concrete solution to the Challenge.

=== University Programs  ===

==== Leading for Impact  ====
Leading for Impact is offered to university students committed to the topic of social impact. The two-phase Program trains students in self-development and entrepreneurial skill. The first edition of Leading for Impact was offered exclusively to University of Oxford students by [[Skoll Centre for Social Entrepreneurship]] at the [[Saïd Business School]] and the DO School. As of 2016, Leading for Impact has also branched out to [[Tsinghua University]] in China.

==== Innovate NYC ====
Innovate NYC brings together students from 10 universities in New York City. For the program’s first edition, which runs from January 2016 to July 2016, students are asked to find concrete answers to the city’s shortage of workspaces for start-ups and entrepreneurs. Beyond that, the aim of the program consists in equipping students with transferable skills in entrepreneurship and innovation as well as to increase retention rates for at-risk students. The program is offered in collaboration with the Center for Economic Transformation at [[New York City Economic Development Corporation|NYCEDC]].

== Partners ==
The DO School holds partnerships with a variety of organizations.

Amongst the DO School’s partners are [[Newman's Own|Newman's Own Foundation]], [[H&amp;M]] Germany, [[Messe Berlin]], [[Covestro]] and the Westerwelle Foundation.

'''The Diana L. Bennett Fellows Program''' is a nine-month fellowship program at the [[Black Mountain Institute]] offered to published writers and public intellectuals. Funded by [[Sonja and Michael Saltman]], the [[International Women's Forum]], the [[Library of Congress]], and [[Tom and Mary Gallagher]], fellowships are awarded to candidates whose work ranges away from the American experience and into international terrain and who have an ongoing project that would benefit from a period of sustained immersion. The program accepts applications from novelists, poets, playwrights, historians, political scientists, independent scholars, and anyone else whose work is meant for a general, educated lay audience.

==Criteria==
The BMI awards three to five fellowships each year to outstanding writers who have published at least one critically acclaimed book before the time of application. Foreign nationals conversant in English are welcome to apply. There are no degree requirements.

==Terms and conditions==
Fellows receive a $50,000 stipend, an office, a computer, and access to [[UNLV]]'s [[Lied Library]]. They remain in residence at BMI for the duration of the fellowship term (late August to mid May) and work daily at the BMI offices. Fellows are required to give a talk on their work-in-progress to other fellows, as well as to a wide range of invited guests, and to take part in BMI programs. Additionally, fellows must make themselves available, on occasion, as visitors to UNLV graduate classes in fields related to their own work.

==BMI - Kluge Fellowship in partnership with the Library of Congress==
For the 2008-09 through 2010-11 residency cycles, BMI offers one fellowship in conjunction with the Library of Congress. The successful candidate will spend a portion of his or her time in Las Vegas and a portion at the [[John W. Kluge Center]] of the [[Library of Congress]] in [[Washington D.C.]], making use of the nation's largest and most prestigious research library.

The [[International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement|IEA]]'s '''Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study''' ('''TIMSS''') is a series of international assessments of the mathematics and science knowledge of students around the world. The participating students come from a diverse set of educational systems (countries or regional jurisdictions of countries) in terms of economic development, geographical location, and population size. In each of the participating educational systems, a minimum of 4,500 to 5,000 students is evaluated. Contextual data about the conditions in which participating students learn mathematics and science are collected from the students and their teachers, their principals, and their parents via questionnaires.&lt;ref name="TIMSS 2015 and TIMSS Advanced 2015 International Results"&gt;{{cite web|title= TIMSS 2015 and TIMSS Advanced 2015 International Results|url=http://timssandpirls.bc.edu/timss2015/international-results/|publisher= TIMSS International Study Center|accessdate=15 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TIMSS is one of the studies established by IEA aimed at allowing educational systems worldwide to compare students' educational achievement and learn from the experiences of others in designing effective education policy. This assessment was first conducted in 1995, and has been administered every four years thereafter. Therefore, some of the participating educational systems have trend data across assessments from 1995 to 2015.&lt;ref name="TIMSS &amp; PIRLS Home"&gt;{{cite web|title=TIMSS &amp; PIRLS International Study Center|url=http://timssandpirls.bc.edu/|accessdate=15 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; TIMSS assesses 4th and 8th grade students, while TIMSS Advanced assesses students in the final year of secondary school in advanced mathematics and physics. 

==History==

A precursor to TIMSS was the First International Mathematics Study (FIMS) performed in 1964 in 11 countries for students aged 13 and in the final year of secondary education (FS) under the auspices of the  [[International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement]] (IEA).  This was followed in 1970-71 by the First International Science Study (FISS) for students aged 10, 14, and FS.  Fourteen countries tested 10-year olds;  16 countries tested the older two groups.  These were replicated between 1980 and 1984.&lt;ref&gt;Hanushek and Woessman (2015, Table 2.1, p. 18).&lt;/ref&gt;

These early studies were revised and combined by the IEA to create TIMSS, which was first administered in 1995.  It was the largest international student assessment study of its time and evaluated students in five grades. In the second cycle (1999) only eighth-grade students were tested. In the next cycles (2003, 2007, 2011 and 2015) both 4th and 8th grade students were assessed. The 2011 cycle was performed in the same year as the IEA's [[Progress in International Reading Literacy Study]] (PIRLS), offering a comprehensive assessment of mathematics, science and reading for the countries participating in both studies. The sixth cycle was conducted in 2015, and the results were released in 2016;&lt;ref name="TIMSS 2015 and TIMSS Advanced 2015 International Results"/&gt; the data set was published in February 2017. TIMSS 2015 included data collected from parents for the first time.&lt;ref name="www.iea.nl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timssandpirls.bc.edu/timss2011/countries.html|title=TIMSS 2011 Participating Countries|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=21 Nov 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; TIMSS Advanced, previously conducted in 1995 and 2008, was also conducted in 2015, and assessed final-year secondary students' achievement in advanced mathematics and physics. Policy-relevant data about curriculum emphasis, technology use, and teacher preparation and training accompanies the TIMSS Advanced results.

==Method, data and documentation==
Along with the overall students’ achievement data, TIMSS comprehensive assessments include data on student performance in various mathematics and science domains (algebra, geometry, biology, chemistry, etc.) and on performance in the problem solving challenges in each of these contexts. In addition, TIMSS provides contextual data on crucial curricular, instructional, and resource-related factors that can impact the teaching and learning process. These data are gathered using student, teacher, school, and curriculum (national) questionnaires filled out by students, teachers, school principals and National Research Coordinators, respectively.

According to the TIMSS 2011 international results in mathematics, “The TIMSS mathematics achievement scales were established in TIMSS 1995 based on the achievement distribution across all participating countries, treating each country equally. At each grade level, the scale center point of 500 was set to correspond to the mean of the overall achievement distribution, and 100 points on the scale was set to correspond to the standard deviation. Achievement data from subsequent TIMSS assessment cycles were linked to these scales so that increases or decreases in average achievement may be monitored across assessments. TIMSS uses the scale center point as a point of reference that remains constant from assessment to assessment”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TIMSS 2011 International Results in Mathematics|url=http://timssandpirls.bc.edu/timss2011/downloads/T11_IR_Mathematics_FullBook.pdf|publisher=TIMSS &amp; PIRLS International Study Center|accessdate=4 May 2013|pages=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because TIMSS is administered in four-year cycles, it enables participating counties to use the results between the fourth and eighth grades to track the changes in achievement and certain background factors from an earlier study. For example, results of the fourth grade in TIMSS 1995 can be compared with the results of the eighth grade in TIMSS 1999, as fourth graders had become eighth graders in the next cycle of study.&lt;ref name="U.S. Department of Education"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pursuing Excellence: Comparisons of International Eighth-Grade Mathematics and Science Achievement from a U.S. Perspective, 1995 and 1999|url=http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2001/2001028.pdf|publisher=U.S. Department of Education|accessdate=4 May 2013|page=2|date=December 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The collected information is presented in different formats. For example, for TIMSS 2015 the results are presented as TIMSS International Results in Science [http://timssandpirls.bc.edu/timss2015/international-results/timss-2015/science/student-achievement/ TIMSS International Results in Science] and [http://timssandpirls.bc.edu/timss2015/international-results/timss-2015/mathematics/student-achievement/ TIMSS International Results in Mathematics]. The [http://timssandpirls.bc.edu/timss2015/encyclopedia/ TIMSS 2015 Encyclopedia] provides an overview of how mathematics and science are taught in each participating country. [http://timssandpirls.bc.edu/publications/timss/2015-methods.html Methods and Procedures in TIMSS 2015] documents the development of the TIMSS assessments and questionnaires, and describes the methods used. The [http://timssandpirls.bc.edu/timss2015/international-database/ TIMSS 2015 User Guide for the International Database] describes the content and format of the data in the [http://timssandpirls.bc.edu/timss2015/international-database/ TIMSS 2015 International Database]. The fully documented TIMSS 2015 international database can be downloaded.

The IEA has developed an application for working with data from TIMSS and other IEA large-scale assessments called the {{cite web|title=IEA International Database (IDB) Analyzer|url=http://www.iea.nl/eula.html|}}. This application allows researchers to combine data files and facilitates some types of statistical analysis (such as computing [[mean]]s, [[percentages]], [[percentiles]], [[correlations]], and estimating single level multiple [[linear regression]]). The application takes into account the complex sample structure of the databases when calculating the statistics and their standard errors. It also allows researchers to estimate achievement scores and their standard errors.

For an overview of the IEA study results and interpretation of information, the IEA's {{cite web|title=Data Visualizer|url=http://data-visualizer.iea.nl|}} can come in handy.

==Cycles==
In TIMSS 1995&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iea.nl/timss-1995|title=TIMSS 1995 - IEA|author=|date=|website=www.iea.nl|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, there were 41 educational systems in five grades (third, fourth, seventh, eighth, and the final year of secondary school).&lt;ref name="www.iea.nl"/&gt; In 1999&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iea.nl/timss-1999|title=TIMSS 1999 - IEA|author=|date=|website=www.iea.nl|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, TIMSS only focused on the eighth grade in 38 educational systems; there was no study done for the fourth grade in that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timssandpirls.bc.edu/timss1999i/participants.html|title=TIMSS 1999 Participants|website=timssandpirls.bc.edu|access-date=2017-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In TIMSS 2003&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iea.nl/timss-2003|title=TIMSS 2003 - IEA|author=|date=|website=www.iea.nl|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, there were 26 educational systems for the fourth grade and 48 for the eighth grade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timssandpirls.bc.edu/timss2003i/countries.html|title=TIMSS 2003 Countries Participating|last=center|first=international study|website=timssandpirls.bc.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In TIMSS 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iea.nl/timss-2007|title=TIMSS 2007 - IEA|author=|date=|website=www.iea.nl|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, 44 educational systems participated in the fourth grade and 57 educational systems in the eighth grade. TIMSS 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iea.nl/timss-2011|title=TIMSS 2011 - IEA|author=|date=|website=www.iea.nl|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; had 52 participating educational systems for the fourth grade and 45 for the eighth grade.&lt;ref name="www.iea.nl"/&gt;

In TIMSS 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iea.nl/timss-2015|title=TIMSS 2015 - IEA|author=|date=|website=www.iea.nl|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, nationally representative samples of students in 57 countries and 7 benchmarking entities participated in the fourth grade assessment, the eighth grade assessment, or both.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timssandpirls.bc.edu/timss2015/international-results/timss-2015/about-timss-2015/|title=About TIMSS 2015 – TIMSS 2015 and TIMSS Advanced 2015 International Results|website=timssandpirls.bc.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

TIMSS 2019 will be the seventh cycle of TIMSS, reporting overall achievement as well as results according to international benchmarks, by major content domains (number, algebra, and geometry in mathematics, and earth science, biology, and chemistry in science), and by cognitive domains (knowing, applying, and reasoning). Like the previous TIMSS assessments (conducted in 1995, 1999, 2003, 2007, 2011, and 2015), the study will collect detailed information about curriculum and curriculum implementation, instructional practices, and school resources. TIMSS 2019 is focusing on converting to a digital format (eTIMSS 2019). Fourth-grade students can interact with geometric shapes and patterns to demonstrate their mastery of fractions and symmetry, or arrange square flower boxes to explore the relationship between perimeter and area. Eighth-grade students can help to design a storage building by calculating its dimensions, or plan a plant growth experiment and see the results. Other tasks will assess students’ knowledge in areas covered by the TIMSS frameworks, including algebra, data and chance, physics, and chemistry&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iea.nl/sites/default/files/studies/T2019_eTIMSS_BROCHURE.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;.
 
eTIMSS will continue all the benefits of TIMSS, enabling countries to measure how effective they are in teaching mathematics and science. 

==Additional initiatives==
The TIMSS 1999 Video Study&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timssvideo.com/timss-video-study&lt;/ref&gt; was a study of eighth-grade mathematics and science teaching in seven countries. The study involved videotaping and analyzing teaching practices in more than one thousand classrooms. In conjunction with the IEA, the study was conducted by the US National Center for Education Statistics, and the US Department of Education under a contract with LessonLab, Inc. of Los Angeles, California.

==Cooperative partners==
TIMSS depends on the collaboration of a large number of individuals and organizations around the world including the [http://timssandpirls.bc.edu/ TIMSS &amp; PIRLS International Study Center at Boston College], [http://www.iea.nl/ IEA's offices in Amsterdam and Hamburg], [[Statistics Canada]], and [[Educational Testing Service]] (ETS). In the United States, TIMSS is conducted by the [[National Center for Education Statistics]] of the US Department of Education. Data for US students is further tracked for ethnic and racial groups. TIMSS is mainly funded by the participating countries. Also, the US National Center for Education Statistics of the US Department of Education and the World Bank provide major support funding for the assessments.&lt;ref name="www.iea.nl"/&gt;

==Introduction of tuition fees==

'''[[Tuition fees]]''' existed in French universities prior to the second world war&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}}http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/education/funding-in-higher-education-and-economic-growth-in-france-and-the-united-kingdom-1921-2003_hemp-v18-art16-en?crawler=true&amp;mimetype=application/pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and has remained at approximately the same level as % of total funding. 
Since 2007 universities in France have been granted a greater degree of independence, including the ability to increase fees in excess of the maximum established by the state for postgraduate studies. Undergraduate studies are nevertheless capped.

Private sector institutions are free to establish the fees they desire. In the public sector fees may differ between Universities and higher education establishments ([[Grands établissements]]).

==Tuition fees in the public sector==

===Non-autonomous Universities===
Fees for undergraduate studies are determined annually by the [[Ministry of National Education (France)|Education Ministry]]. In 2013 the following fees were set by the state;&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}}{{cite web |url=http://www.service-public.fr/actualites/00292.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-09-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130701235127/http://www.service-public.fr/actualites/00292.html |archivedate=1 July 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Undergraduates 184 euros
*Post-graduates 254 euros 
*Doctorates 388 euros

===Autonomous universities===
Since 2007 universities may opt for an autonomous status. Autonomous universities have the ability to determine certain tuition fees. While undergraduate fees are capped at the level set by the Ministry of Education, post-graduate and doctorate studies may be set freely by the universities. [[Paris Dauphine University|Paris-Dauphine university]] was one of the first universities to approve a significant increase in the tuition fees for its Masters in 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}}http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2010/02/02/l-universite-paris-dauphine-augmente-les-frais-de-scolarite-de-ses-masters_1299912_3224.html&lt;/ref&gt;
Fees were increased from the then national standard fees of 210 euros to 4000 euros (for family revenus above 80,000 euros).In 2013 90% of French universities had opted for the autonomy status.

===Higher education establishments===
Higher education establishments (also referred to as [[Grands établissements]])differ from universities as admissions are based on entry exams. The fees charged by these state establishments are higher than in universities but remain low by international comparison. There are 60 such establishments. The fees range from 450 euros to 1100 euros per annum&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}}http://www.letudiant.fr/etudes/ecole-ingenieur/le-palmares-2007-des-ecoles-d-ingenieurs/les-frais-de-scolarite-dans-les-ecoles-apres-prepa-13568.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Supplementary fees==
Since 1993 Universities may also charge certain clearly identified supplementary fees linked to the particular type of studies. Such fees may include a contribution to the costs of specialist equipment.

==Social security==
Although not part of tuition fees students are required to pay social security contributions of approximately 200 euros per year.

'''WeBWorK''' is an online homework delivery system primarily used for mathematics and science. It allows students to complete their homework over the web, and receive instantaneous feedback as to the correctness of their responses. WeBWorK uses a [[Perl]]-based language called '''PG''' to specify exercises which allows instructors a great deal of flexibility in how exercises are presented.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

 | year = 2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

WeBWorK was originally developed at the [[University of Rochester]] by professors [[Michael Gage]], and [[Arnold Pizer]]. It is now a free software project maintained by many contributors at several colleges and universities. It is made available under the [[Artistic License]] (the same license as Perl) and the [[GNU General Public License]]. 

WeBWorK is currently being used by many universities and high-schools around the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://webwork.maa.org/wiki/WeBWorK_Sites&lt;/ref&gt; One main place where it is being used is the UMTYMP program, designed to help students taking the course get a feel for the college life.

WeBWorK is supported by the [[National Science Foundation]] and the [[Mathematical Association of America]].&lt;ref&gt;http://webwork.maa.org/wiki/Grants,_awards,_and_support&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Williamsburg: the Story of a Patriot''''', often called '''''The Patriot''''', is an orientation film produced by [[Paramount Pictures]] and the [[Colonial Williamsburg]] Foundation in 1957, has the distinction of being the longest-running motion picture in history, having been shown continually in the Colonial Williamsburg Visitor Center for over five decades. On September 20, 2002, it was seen by the 30 millionth viewer.&lt;ref name="30 millionth"&gt;{{cite web|title=30 million visitors experience "The Story of a Patriot"|url=http://www.history.org/Foundation/general/patriot.cfm|publisher=Colonial Williamsburg Foundation|accessdate=18 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
As [[museum]] orientation films go, ''Williamsburg: the Story of a Patriot'' is a landmark, both because of its high production values and structure.

It was filmed in May 1956 at Colonial Williamsburg.&lt;ref name="Greenspan 1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Greenspan|first=Anderson|title=Creating Colonial Williamsburg: The Restoration of Virginia's Eighteenth-Century Capital|date=2009|isbn=978-0-8078-3343-8|publisher=The University of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill|pages=111–112; 134|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the usual [[35 mm film|35mm]] flat-screen 1.33:1 ratio cinematography would have been considered extravagant for an orientation film, ''Williamsburg: the Story of a Patriot'' was filmed and exhibited in [[VistaVision]], a high definition widescreen process with approximately the same negative size as 35mm still photography. It was a unique VistaVision film in that it was shown with six-channel stereo sound, whereas most films in that process were either shown in mono or in [[Perspecta]] sound. The music for the film was composed and conducted by [[Bernard Herrmann]], who was at the time best known for scoring several [[Alfred Hitchcock]] films.

Moreover, where previous museum orientation films (and many present day examples) are simple [[Travelogue (films)|travelogue]]s, with little or no narrative content, ''Williamsburg: the Story of a Patriot'' told the story of Virginia's role in American Independence (up to the point of voting to propose independence at the [[Second Continental Congress]]), from the point of view of John Fry (played by a young [[Jack Lord]]), a fictional Virginia planter elected to the [[House of Burgesses]]. While it was filmed almost entirely in and around the Colonial Williamsburg Historic Area, and points out a number of the historic buildings by name, it is overwhelmingly a dramatization of history, rather than a travelogue.

A pair of specially-designed theaters each seating 250 persons were built for showing the film, as part of the new visitors center being built at the time.&lt;ref name=1957NYT /&gt; It was previewed for an audience including the Governor of Virginia and members of the [[Virginia General Assembly]] on the evening of March 30, and formally opened March 31, 1957.&lt;ref name=1957NYT&gt;{{cite news|last=Crowther|first=Bosley|title=Movie Review: Williamsburg, The Story of A Patriot|url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D01EED81E3EE63ABC4953DFB266838C649EDE|accessdate=26 August 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=April 1, 1957}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1960s, the film was translated into several languages for personal speakers that could be used by international visitors.&lt;ref name="Greenspan 1" /&gt;

==Restoration==
By the 1990s, the film was showing its age, with severe fading problems in the original negatives, and differing shrinkage rates in the separation masters that had been made as a backup.&lt;ref name="Remastering a Masterwork" /&gt; As a result, even new prints looked no better than a 16mm orientation film would have looked.

In 2001, an extensive digital restoration effort was begun,&lt;ref name="Remastering a Masterwork" /&gt; the result of which debuted (in relatively conventional 70mm DTS prints) in 2004. This is generally regarded as coming as close as present-day technology permits to replicate the clarity of the film as originally shown in the late 1950s.&lt;ref name="Remastering a Masterwork"&gt;{{cite news|last=McCluney Jr.|first=Richard L.|title=Remastering a Masterwork: Restoration of "The Patriot"|url=http://www.history.org/Foundation/journal/Summer04/patriot.cfm|accessdate=19 February 2014|newspaper=Colonial Williamsburg Journal|date=Summer 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that despite the 35 minute running-time of this film, the restoration required enough digital storage to hold several feature-length films.

==DVD==
As of 2007, ''Williamsburg: the Story of a Patriot'' has been released on DVD, available from the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation.
