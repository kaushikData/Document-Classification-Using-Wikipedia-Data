      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16583">The '''2010 gang rapes in Cleveland, Texas''' were a series of acts of [[sexual violence]] committed by a group of adult men and teenage boys on an [[Minor (law)#United States|underage]] girl in the town of [[ Cleveland, Texas|Cleveland]], in [[Texas]], USA.
==Background==
The victim was the 11-year old daughter of [[Mexicans|Mexican]] [[Immigration to the United States|immigrants]], living in [[Cleveland, Texas]], a "timber town"&lt;ref name=worst&gt;{{cite news |last1=Jarboe Russell|first1=Jan|date=July 2011 |title=The Worst Hard Time |url=https://www.texasmonthly.com/articles/the-worst-hard-time/ |dead-url=no |work=[[Texas Monthly]] |location=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|access-date=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; of about nine thousand people in the  [[Greater Houston]] metropolitan area and [[Liberty County, Texas|Liberty&amp;nbsp;County]]. Her father was a former [[construction worker]], unemployed at the time for a year and a half because of a back injury, while her mother was working making change in a [[Slot machine|slot game room]].&lt;ref name=gq/&gt;

The group of perpetrators included students at the local high school, two of whom were members of the basketball team and one the son of a school-board member, and persons with [[criminal record]]s, from [[Recreational drug use|selling drug]]s to [[robbery]] and, in one case, [[manslaughter]]. They ranged from [[Middle_school#United_States|middle school]]ers to one 27-year-old, at the time of the crime.&lt;ref name=vicious&gt;{{cite news |last1=McKinley|first1=James C. |date=8 March 2011 |title=Vicious Assault Shakes Texas Town |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/09/us/09assault.html?hp |dead-url=no |work=[[The New York Times]] |location=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|access-date=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Discovery==
On the Monday after [[Thanksgiving]] day, on 29 November 2010, a [[cell phone]] [[video clip]] with images of the sexual encounter between a group of males and a young female circulated in the cafeteria of Cleveland's high school. Some viewers recognized the girl as a [[Sixth grade#United States|6th grade]]r from the middle school next door.&lt;ref name=gq&gt;{{cite news |last1=Dobie|first1=Kathie |date=6 September 2011 |title=The Girl from Trails End|url=https://www.gq.com/story/texas-gang-rape-11-year-old-girl-story|dead-url=no |work=[[GQ]] |location=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|access-date=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A friend of the girl told a teacher what he had seen in the cell-phone video, as a school-district spokeswoman subsequently stated, and the police were alerted.&lt;ref name=sloppy&gt;{{cite news |last1=Williams|first1=Mary Elizabeth |date=9 March 2011 |title=The New York Times’ sloppy, slanted child rape story |url=https://www.salon.com/2011/03/09/new_york_times_blames_11_year_old_rape_victim/|dead-url=no |work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |location=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|access-date=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=arrested&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lozano|first1=Juan A. |date=9 March 2011 |title=18 arrested in assaults on 11-year-old Texas girl|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/41993963/ns/us_news-crime_and_courts/t/arrested-assaults--year-old-texas-girl/#.W7cNP2j7Tcu|dead-url=no |work=[[NBC News]] |location=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|access-date=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Investigation==
Police investigators identified and contacted the girl, whereupon she stated that, over the 2010 Thanksgiving holiday break, she was raped by a group of young men first at a house and then in a [[mobile home]]. According to a [[search warrant]] [[affidavit]] obtained by the media, police determined the video clip was recorded inside an abandoned mobile home on the city's northern outskirts, next to a [[Baptist church]].&lt;ref name=arrested&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lozano|first1=Juan A. |date=9 March 2011 |title=18 arrested in assaults on 11-year-old Texas girl|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/41993963/ns/us_news-crime_and_courts/t/arrested-assaults--year-old-texas-girl/#.W7cNP2j7Tcu|dead-url=no |work=[[NBC News]] |location=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|access-date=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the subsequent, criminal [[indictment]]s, the girl was assaulted on four separate occasions: the first in September, followed by three more throughout the fall of 2010. In January 2011, she was removed by [[social worker]]s from her parents' home and taken to [[foster care]].&lt;ref name=gq/&gt;

The investigation stirred [[Racism in the United States|racial tensions]] on account of the defendants all being [[African-American]]s and the girl [[Hispanic]],&lt;ref name=period&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hopper|first1=Jessica |date=18 March 2011 |title=Texas Girl Allegedly Gang Raped Over Three Month Period |url=https://abcnews.go.com/US/cleveland-texas-girl-allegedly-raped-multiple-times-court/story?id=13167326|work=[[ABC News]] |location=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|access-date=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in both the town and nationwide.&lt;ref name=appear&gt;{{cite news |last1=Martinez|first1=Edecio |date=5 April 2011 |title=Cleveland, Texas gang rape suspects appear in court |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cleveland-texas-gang-rape-suspects-appear-in-court/|work=[[CBS News]] |location=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|access-date=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event was publicized nationwide in the States and also abroad.&lt;ref name=paris&gt;{{cite news |last1=Vely|first1=Yannick|date=9 March 2011 |title=Le Viol Collectif qui choque l’Amérique|url=https://www.parismatch.com/Actu/International/Le-viol-collectif-qui-choque-l-Amerique-146689|dead-url=no|language=French|trans-title=The Gang Rape that shocked America |work=[[Paris Match]] |location=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|access-date=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Freeman|first1=Hadley|author-link=Hadley Freeman|date=3 September 2013 |title=The painful lesson of the Cherice Moralez rape trial|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/03/painful-lesson-cherice-moralez-rape|dead-url=no |work=[[The Guardian]] |location=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|access-date=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Monday 4 April 2011,  nineteen defendants appeared in the court of [[Liberty County, Texas|Liberty County]] district judge Mark Morefield for their [[arraignment]] hearing, with six of them pleading "not guilty."&lt;ref name=appear/&gt;

==Support for the accused==
The ''[[New York Times]]''' first report&lt;ref name=vicious/&gt; focused on the impact of the crime on the Cleveland community.&lt;ref group=note&gt;On the 8 March NYT article, a hospital worker, who said she knew several of the defendants, was quoted: “It’s just destroyed our community. These boys have to live with this the rest of their lives.” Also quoted was the spokeswoman for the Cleveland Independent School District: “It’s devastating, and it’s really tearing our community apart. I really wish that this could end in a better light.” There were also quotes from local people who questioned the attitude of the victim's family, such as a neighbor of her parents: "Where was her mother? What was her mother thinking?”&lt;/ref&gt; The report came under criticism for its alleged "sympathy" for the accused,&lt;ref name=mj&gt;{{cite news |last1=McCleland|first1=Mac |date=9 March 2011 |title=The New York Times’ Rape-Friendly Reporting|url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2011/03/new-york-times-texas-rape/|dead-url=no |work=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]] |location=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|access-date=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nymag&gt;{{cite news |last1=Amira|first1=Dan |date=11 March 2011 |title=A Lot of People in Cleveland, Texas, Blame 11-Year-Old for Being Raped|url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2011/03/a_lot_of_people_in_cleveland_t.html|dead-url=no |work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] ''magazine'' |location=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|access-date=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nation&gt;{{cite news |last1= Cobb|first1= William Jelani|author-link=William Jelani Cobb|date=29 March 2011 |title=Cleveland, Texas and Gender Jim Crow |url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2011/03/a_lot_of_people_in_cleveland_t.html|dead-url=no |work=[[The Nation]] |location=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|access-date=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the point where the newspaper sent another reporter back at the place&lt;ref name=balance&gt;{{cite news |last1=Brisbane|first1=Arthur S.|date=11 March 2011 |title=Gang Rape Story Lacked Balance |url=https://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/11/gang-rape-story-lacked-balance/?smid=fb-nytimes|dead-url=no |work=[[The New York Times]] |location=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|access-date=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and published a self-critical article.&lt;ref group=note&gt;The 11 March NYT article stated: "The outrage [against the previous NYT report] is understandable. The story dealt with a hideous crime but addressed concerns about the ruined lives of the perpetrators without acknowledging the obvious: concern for the victim. While the story appeared to focus on the community’s reaction to the crime, it was not enough to simply report that the community is principally concerned about the boys and men involved – as this story seems to do. If indeed that is the only sentiment to be found in this community...it becomes important to report... as well [of] voices of professional authorities or dissenting community members who will at least address, and not ignore, the plight of the young girl involved."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Quanell X]], [[community leader]] and head of the [[New Black Panthers]], was an "outspoken critic" of the  victim. In a [[press conference]] in front of a Cleveland church, he [[rhetorical question|asked rhetorically]] where the girl's parents were when this happened and why was "that child experiencing so much sex with so many African-American men." He also disputed the rape claims since, as he put it, the girl never actually yelled the word "rape" during the assault and did not make an "outcry" until after footage of the assault surfaced.&lt;ref group=note&gt;According to the ''[[Houston Press]]'' 2014 report, Quanell X  claimed the investigation into the rape was being "run by the [[KKK]]" and stated to the [[African American]] community of the town: "We do not want someone with a malicious, racist motive to rid your community of an entire generation of black men."&lt;/ref&gt; The media reported that the audience "cheered and hollered in agreement."&lt;ref name=cheered&gt;{{cite news |last1=Leicht|first1=Angelica|date=19 December 2014 |title=Why Does Quanell X Support Some Rape Victims But Shame Others?|url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2011/03/a_lot_of_people_in_cleveland_t.html|dead-url=no |work=[[Houston Press]] |location=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|access-date=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Florida]] [[United States House of Representatives|representative]] [[Kathleen Passidomo]] proposed that the state should step in and regulate the wardrobe of young girls.&lt;ref name=pasidomo&gt;{{cite news |last1=Linkins|first1=Jason|date=13 March 2011 |title=In Wake Of Texas Gang Rape, Florida Lawmaker Proposes School Dress Code Legislation|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/03/16/texas-gang-rape-aftermath-florida-law_n_836841.html|dead-url=no |work=[[Huffington Post]] |location=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|access-date=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pasidomo referred to "an article about an 11 year old girl who was gang-raped in Texas by 18 young men because she was dressed like a 21-year-old [[prostitute]].”&lt;ref group=note&gt;Passidomo claimed that "it’s incumbent upon [the state] to create some areas where students can be safe in school and show up in proper attire, so what happened in Texas doesn’t happen to [Florida's] students.”&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trials==
In Texas, [[sexual assault]] against a [[Minor (law)#United States|person under 17 years of age]] is a second degree [[felony]], and [[aggravated sexual assault]] a first degree felony.&lt;ref name=texaslaw&gt;{{cite web |url=https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/PE/htm/PE.22.htm|title=Penal Code - Title 5, Chapter 22: Assaultive Offenses|publisher=[[Texas Department of Criminal Justice]] |date=October 2017 |website=|access-date=7 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, twenty-one persons were charged with crimes related to the gang rape.&lt;ref name=four&gt;{{cite news |date=21 September 2012 |title=Texas: Four Get 15-Year Sentences in Gang Rape of 11-Year-Old Girl|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/22/us/four-sentenced-in-gang-rape-of-11-year-old-texas-girl.html|dead-url=no |work=[[The New York Times]] |location=Associated Press|archiveurl=|archivedate=|access-date=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only two adult males requested trials, and juries handed each defendant a 99-year prison sentence. Eleven other adult males pleaded guilty to the charges against them and received 15-year sentences in exchange. All seven juveniles entered guilty pleas and received seven-year [[Probation|probated prison-sentences]].&lt;ref name=final&gt;{{cite news |last=Horswell  |first=Cindy   |date=11 October 2013|title=21st assailant sentenced in Cleveland gang rape|url=https://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/21st-assailant-sentenced-in-Cleveland-gang-rape-4889262.php|dead-url=no |work=[[Houston Chronicle]] |location= |archiveurl= |access-date=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The twenty-first and last defendant pleaded guilty after a year long investigation whereby a [[DNA profiling|DNA specimen]] identified him as being at the [[crime scene]]. The defendant received a reduced seven-year sentence in exchange for pleading guilty to [[Indecent exposure|indecently exposing]] himself to a child. All defendants sentenced to prison would be [[Sex offender registry|registered]] as [[sex offender]]s for ten years after completing the sentence.&lt;ref name=final/&gt;

==Aftermath==
When the investigation started, the victim's family moved to another town after police detectives told the parents that they were in danger,&lt;ref name=nightmare&gt;{{cite news |last1=McKinley|first1=James C.|last2=Goode|first2=Erica |date=28 March 2011 |title=3-Month Nightmare Emerges in Rape Inquiry |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/29/us/29texas.html |dead-url=no |work=[[The New York Times]] |location=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|access-date=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the  girl who was reported as raped was placed by the [[Child Protective Services]] in the care of the Girls' Haven in [[Beaumont, Texas]]. In December 2011, she ran away from the residential facility and was "on the streets for about a week," as the [[Jefferson County, Texas|Jefferson County]] prosecutor stated. He revealed that, at some point, she met a 30-year-old male with a prior conviction as a drug dealer in [[Fort Bend County]], who subsequently assaulted her at his apartment in Beaumont. The assailant was arrested and pleaded guilty in September 2012 to aggravated sexual assault of a child in exchange for deferred [[probation]].&lt;ref name=life&gt;{{cite news |last=Horswell  |first=Cindy   |date=29 December 2012|title=Defendant in Cleveland gang rape case gets life sentence|url=https://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Defendant-in-Cleveland-gang-rape-case-gets-life-4073766.php|dead-url=no |work=[[Houston Chronicle]] |location= |archiveurl= |access-date=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the girl revealed she was pregnant, allegedly from her "15-year old boyfriend," and that they would keep the baby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=|first=   |date=22 May 2013|title=Girl, 14, now pregnant — was victim at age 11 of repeated gang rape|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/girl-14-pregnant-victim-age-11-repeated-gang-rape-article-1.1351930|dead-url=no |work=[[The New York Daily News]] |location= |archiveurl= |access-date=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''32X''' is an [[video game accessory|add-on]] for the [[Sega Genesis]] [[video game console]]. Codenamed "Project Mars", the 32X was designed to expand the power of the Genesis and serve as a transitional console into the [[History of video game consoles (fifth generation)|32-bit era]] until the release of the [[Sega Saturn]]. Independent of the Genesis, the 32X uses its own [[ROM cartridge]]s and has its own [[List of Sega 32X games|library of games]]. The add-on was distributed under the name {{nihongo foot|'''Super 32X'''|スーパー32{{ruby|X|エックス}}|Sūpā Sanjūni Ekkusu|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}}&lt;!-- See [[WP:JFN]] --&gt; in Japan, '''Genesis 32X''' in North America, '''Mega Drive 32X''' in the [[PAL]] region, and '''Mega 32X''' in Brazil.

Unveiled by [[Sega]] at June 1994's [[Consumer Electronics Show]], the 32X was presented as a low-cost option for consumers looking to play 32-bit games. Developed in response to the [[Atari Jaguar]] and concerns that the Saturn would not make it to market by the end of 1994, the product was conceived as an entirely new console. At the suggestion of Sega of America executive Joe Miller and his team, the console was converted into an add-on to the existing Genesis and made more powerful.  The final design contained two 32-bit [[central processing units]] and a 3D&amp;nbsp;graphics processor.  To bring the new add-on to market by its scheduled release date of November 1994, development of the new system and its games was rushed. The console failed to attract third-party [[video game developer]]s and consumers because of the announcement of the Sega Saturn's simultaneous release in Japan. Sega's efforts to rush the 32X to market cut into available time for game development, resulting in a weak library of forty titles that could not fully use the add-on's hardware, including Genesis [[porting|ports]]. By the end of 1994, the 32X had sold 665,000 units. After price reductions in 1995, it was discontinued in 1996 as Sega turned its focus to the Saturn.

The 32X is considered a [[List of commercial failures in video gaming|commercial failure]]. Reception after the add-on's unveiling and launch was positive, highlighting the low price of the system and power expansion to the Genesis. Later reviews, both contemporary and retrospective, for the 32X have been mostly negative because of its shallow game library, poor market timing and the resulting market fragmentation for the Genesis.

The [[Sega Genesis]], initially released in Japan as the Mega Drive in 1988, was Sega's entry into the [[History of video game consoles (fourth generation)|16-bit era]] of video game consoles.&lt;ref name="RetroinspectionG"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Retro Gamer]]|publisher=Imagine Publishing|title=Retroinspection: Mega Drive|author=Sczepaniak, John|issue=27|year=2006|pages=42–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; The console was then released as the Genesis in 1989 for the North American market, with releases in other regions following a year later.&lt;ref name="RetroinspectionG"/&gt;

Although the earlier release of the [[Sega CD]] add-on had been commercially disappointing,&lt;ref name="Retroinspection"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Retro Gamer|publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]]|title=Retroinspection: Sega 32X|author=McFerran, Damien|issue=77|pages=44–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EurogamerRAF"&gt;{{cite web|last=McFerran|first=Damien|title=The Rise and Fall of Sega Enterprises|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-02-22-the-rise-and-fall-of-sega-enterprises|publisher=Eurogamer|accessdate=May 1, 2014|date=February 22, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140216124431/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-02-22-the-rise-and-fall-of-sega-enterprises|archivedate=February 16, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sega began to develop a [[Improvisation|stop-gap]] solution that would bridge the gap between the Genesis and the [[Sega Saturn]], serving as a less expensive entry into the [[History of video game consoles (fifth generation)|32-bit era]].&lt;ref name="32XIGN"&gt;{{cite web|author=Buchanan, Levi|title=32X Follies|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=October 24, 2008|accessdate=May 25, 2013|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2008/10/24/32x-follies|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417080118/http://www.ign.com/articles/2008/10/24/32x-follies|archivedate=April 17, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The decision to create a new system was made by Sega CEO Hayao Nakayama and broadly supported by Sega of America employees.  According to former Sega of America producer Scot Bayless, Nakayama was worried that the Saturn would not be available until after 1994, and about the recent release of the [[64-bit]] [[Atari Jaguar]]. As a result, the direction given was to have this second release to market by the end of the year.&lt;ref name="Retroinspection"/&gt;

===Development===
During the Winter [[Consumer Electronics Show]] in January 1994, Sega of America [[research and development]] head Joe Miller took a phone call in his Las Vegas hotel suite from Nakayama, in which Nakayama stressed the importance of coming up with a quick response to the Jaguar.  Included on this call were Bayless, Sega hardware team head Hideki Sato, and Sega of America vice president of technology Marty Franz.  One potential idea for this came from a concept from Sega of Japan, later known as "Project Jupiter", an entirely new independent console.&lt;ref name="Retroinspection"/&gt;  Project Jupiter was initially slated to be a new version of the Genesis, with an upgraded color palette and a lower cost than the upcoming Saturn, as well as with some limited [[3D computer graphics|3D]] capabilities thanks to integration of ideas from the development of the [[Sega Genesis#Sega Virtua Processor|Sega Virtua Processor]] chip.  Miller suggested an alternative strategy, citing concerns with releasing a new console with no previous design specifications within six to nine months.&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;{{cite web|author=Horowitz, Ken|title=Interview: Joe Miller|publisher=Sega-16|url=http://www.sega-16.com/2013/02/interview-joe-miller/|date=February 7, 2013|accessdate=January 10, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202233248/http://www.sega-16.com/2013/02/interview-joe-miller/|archivedate=December 2, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to former Sega of America producer Michael Latham, Miller said, "Oh, that's just a horrible idea.  If all you're going to do is enhance the system, you should make it an add-on.  If it's a new system with legitimate new software, great.  But if the only thing it does is double the colors...."&lt;ref name="Kent_493_496"/&gt;  Miller, however, insists that the decision was made collectively to talk about alternative solutions.  One idea was to leverage the existing Genesis as a way to keep from alienating Sega customers, who would otherwise be required to discard their Genesis systems entirely to play 32-bit games, and to control the cost of the new system.&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt;  This would come in the form of an add-on.  From these discussions, Project Jupiter was discontinued and the new add-on, codenamed "Project Mars", was advanced.&lt;ref name="Retroinspection"/&gt;

At the suggestion from Miller and his team, Sega designed the 32X as a peripheral for the existing Genesis, expanding its power with two 32-bit [[SuperH]]-2 processors.&lt;ref name="Kent_493_496"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kent |first=Steven L. |authorlink=Steven L. Kent |title=The Ultimate History of Video Games: The Story Behind the Craze that Touched our Lives and Changed the World |year=2001 |publisher=Prima Publishing |isbn=0-7615-3643-4 |chapter=The "Next" Generation (Part 1)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SH-2 had been developed in 1993 as a joint venture between Sega and Japanese electronics company [[Hitachi]].&lt;ref name="NG February"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sega Saturn|journal=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|publisher=[[Future plc|Imagine Media]]|date=February 1995|issue=2|volume=1|pages=36–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original design for the 32X add-on, according to Bayless, was created on a cocktail napkin,&lt;ref name="RetroinspectionCD"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Retro Gamer]]&amp;nbsp;— the Mega Drive Book|title=Retroinspection: Mega-CD|pages=18–27|author=McFerran, Damien|publisher=Imagine Publishing|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Miller insists that this was not the case.  At the end of the Consumer Electronics show, with the basic design of the 32X in place, Sega of Japan invited Sega of America to assist in development of the new add-on.&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt;

Although the new unit was a stronger console than originally proposed, it was not compatible with Saturn games.&lt;ref name="Kent_493_496"/&gt; This was justified by Sega's statement that both platforms would run at the same time, and that the 32X would be aimed at players who could not afford the more expensive Saturn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Semrad |first=Ed |title=EGM Goes One-on-One with Sega's Chief - Tom Kalinske|journal=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=65|publisher=Sendai Publishing|date=December 1994|pages=191}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Allgame32X" /&gt; Bayless praised the potential of this system at this point, calling it "a coder's dream for the day" with its twin processors and 3D capabilities.&lt;ref name="Retroinspection"/&gt; Sega of America headed up the development of the 32X, with some assistance from Sato's team at Sega of Japan.  Shortages of processors due to the same 32-bit chips being used in both the 32X and the Saturn hindered the development of the 32X, as did the language barrier between the teams in Japan and the United States.&lt;ref name="Retroinspection"/&gt;

Before the 32X could be launched, the release date of the Saturn was announced for November 1994 in Japan, coinciding with the 32X's target launch date in North America.  Sega of America now was faced with trying to market the 32X with the Saturn's Japan release occurring simultaneously.  Their answer was to call the 32X a "transitional device" between the Genesis and the Saturn, to which Bayless describes of the strategy, "[f]rankly, it just made us look greedy and dumb to consumers."&lt;ref name="Retroinspection"/&gt;

===Pre-launch promotion, release, and marketing===
[[Image:Sega-Saturn-JP-Mk1-Console-Set.jpg|thumb|right|Japanese Sega Saturn, released in November 1994.  The 32X was incompatible with Saturn software.]]
The unveiling of the 32X to the public came at the Summer Consumer Electronics Show in June 1994 in Chicago.  Promoted as the "poor man's entry into 'next generation' games", 32X was marketed for its [[United States dollar|US$]]159 price point as a less-expensive alternative to the Saturn.  However, Sega would not answer whether or not a Genesis console equipped with a Sega CD and a 32X would be able to run Saturn software.  Founder of [[The 3DO Company]], [[Trip Hawkins]], was willing to point out that it would not, stating, "Everyone knows that 32X is a [[Band-Aid]].  It's not a 'next generation system.'  It's fairly expensive.  It's not particularly high-performance.  It's hard to program for, and it's not compatible with the Saturn."&lt;ref name="Kent_493_496"/&gt;  In response to these comments, Sega executive Richard Brudvik-Lindner pointed out that the 32X would play Genesis titles, and had the same system architecture as the Saturn.&lt;ref name="Kent_493_496"/&gt;

In August of that year, ''[[GamePro]]'' highlighted the advantages of the upcoming add-on in its 32-bit processors and significantly lower price, noting that "[n]o doubt gotta-get-it-now gamers will spend the big bucks to grab Saturn or [[PlayStation]] systems and games from Japan.  For the rest of us, however, 32X may well be the system of choice in '94."&lt;ref name="GP32X"&gt;{{cite journal|author="The Whizz"|title=32X: On the Upgrade Path|journal=[[GamePro]]|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|page=30|date=August 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In promotion for the new system, Sega promised 12 games available at launch and 50 games due for release in 1995 from third-party developers.&lt;ref name="GP32X"/&gt;

The 32X was released on November 21, 1994, in North America, in time for the [[Christmas holiday season|holiday season]] that year.&lt;ref name="Kent_493_496"/&gt;  As announced, it retailed for $159.99, and had a reasonably successful launch in the marketplace.&lt;ref name="Retroinspection"/&gt;  Demand among retailers was high, and Sega could not keep up orders for the system.&lt;ref name="Kent_493_496"/&gt;  Over 1,000,000 orders had been placed for 32X units, but Sega had only managed to ship 600,000 units by January 1995.&lt;ref name="Allgame32X" /&gt;  Launching at about the same price as a Genesis console, the price of the 32X was less than half of what the Saturn's price would be at launch.&lt;ref name="32XIGN" /&gt; Despite Sega's initial promises, only six titles were available at its North American launch, including ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', ''[[Star Wars Arcade]]'', ''[[Virtua Racing|Virtua Racing Deluxe]]'', and ''[[Cosmic Carnage]]''. Although ''Virtua Racing'' was considered a "strong" title, ''Cosmic Carnage'' "looked and played so poorly that reporters made jokes about it."&lt;ref name="Kent_493_496"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wire"&gt;{{cite web|author=McConville, James A.|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Sega+32X+upgrade+sees+a+sold-out+Yule.-a016020605|title=Sega 32X upgrade sees a sold-out Yule|date=January 2, 1995|accessdate=February 11, 2014|publisher=[[Business Wire]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Games were available at a retail price of $69.95.&lt;ref name="GP32X" /&gt;  Advertising for the system included images of the 32X being connected to a Genesis console to create an "[[Arcade game|arcade]] system".  Japan received the 32X on December 3, 1994, at a cost of [[Japanese yen|JP¥]]16,800.&lt;ref name="jp"&gt;{{cite web|title=Super 32X|url=https://sega.jp/fb/segahard/32x/|publisher=[[Sega|Sega Corporation]]|accessdate=February 23, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140716105656/http://sega.jp/fb/segahard/32x/|archivedate=July 16, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The system's PAL release came in January 1995, at a price of [[Pound sterling|GB£]]169.99, and also experienced initial high demand.&lt;ref name="Retroinspection"/&gt;

===Decline===
Despite the lower price console's positioning as an inexpensive entry into 32-bit gaming, Sega had a difficult time convincing [[third-party developer]]s to create games for the new system.  Top developers were already aware of the coming arrival of the Sega Saturn, [[Nintendo 64]], and PlayStation, and did not believe the 32X would be capable of competing with any of those systems.&lt;ref name="Kent_493_496"/&gt; The quick development time of the 32X also made game development difficult, according to Franz.&lt;ref name="Retroinspection"/&gt;  Not wanting to create games for an add-on that was "a technological dead-end", many developers decided not to make games for the system.&lt;ref name="GamesRadar+" /&gt;  Issues also plagued titles developed in-house due to the time crunch to release the 32X.  According to Bayless, "games in the queue were effectively jammed into a box as fast as possible, which meant massive cutting of corners in every conceivable way.  Even from the outset, designs of those games were deliberately conservative because of the time crunch.  By the time they shipped they were even more conservative; they did nothing to show off what the hardware was capable of."&lt;ref name="Retroinspection"/&gt;

Journalists were similarly concerned about Sega's tactic of selling two similar consoles at different prices and attempting to support both, likening Sega's approach to that of [[General Motors]] and segmenting the market for its consoles.&lt;ref name="FinWorld"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Morris, Kathleen|title=Nightmare in the Fun House|journal=[[Financial World]]|date=February 21, 1995|volume=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to convince the press that the 32X was a worthwhile console, Sega flew in journalists from all around the country to [[San Francisco]] for a party at a local nightclub. The event featured a speech from Tom Kalinske, live music with a local rapper praising the 32X, and 32X games on exhibition. However, the event turned out to be a bust, as journalists attempted to leave the party due to its loud music and unimpressive games on display, only to find that the buses that brought them to the nightclub had just left and would not return until the scheduled end of the party.&lt;ref name="Kent_493_496"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Ultimate History of Video Games|last=Kent|first=Steven|publisher=Three Rivers Press|year=2001|isbn=|location=|pages=495-496}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the system had a successful launch, demand soon disappeared. Over the first three months of 1995, several of the 32X's third party publishers, including [[Capcom]] and [[Konami]], cancelled their 32X projects so that they could focus on producing games for the Saturn and PlayStation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=32X Update|journal=[[GamePro]]|issue=70 |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=May 1995|page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 32X failed to catch on with the public, and is considered a [[List of commercial failures in video gaming|commercial failure]].&lt;ref name="Kent_493_496"/&gt;  By 1995, the Genesis had still not proven successful in Japan, where it was known as Mega Drive, and the Saturn was beating the PlayStation, so Sega CEO Hayao Nakayama decided to force Sega of America to focus on the Saturn and cut support for Genesis products, executing a surprise early launch of the Saturn in the early summer of 1995.  Sega was supporting five different consoles before this—Saturn, Genesis, [[Game Gear]], [[Sega Pico|Pico]], and the [[Master System]]—as well as the Sega CD and Sega 32X add-ons.&lt;ref name="KSL"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kent |first=Steven L. |authorlink=Steven L.

===Sega Neptune===
The Sega Neptune was a two-in-one Genesis and 32X console which Sega planned to release in fall 1995, with the retail price planned to be something less than US$200.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=CES ProNews Flashes!|journal=[[GamePro]]|issue=68 |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=March 1995|page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sega cancelled the Neptune in October 1995, citing fears that it would dilute their marketing for the Saturn while being priced too close to the Saturn to be a viable competitor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=1995: The Calm Before the Storm?|journal=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=13 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=January 1996|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' used the Sega Neptune as an [[April Fools' Day]] prank in its [[EGM April Fools' jokes#2001|April 2001 issue]]. The issue included a small article in which the writers announced that Sega had found a warehouse full of old Sega Neptunes, and were selling them on a website for only $50.&lt;ref name="EGM"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sega's Neptune Finally Surfaces|publisher=EGM Media, LLC.|journal=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|date=April 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technical aspects and specifications==
[[File:Sega-Genesis-32X-Motherboard-Top.jpg|thumb|Twin [[Hitachi|Hitachi's]] 32-bit SH2 chips power the 32X]]
The 32X can be used only in conjunction with a Genesis system.  It is inserted into the system like a standard game cartridge.  The add-on requires its own separate power supply, a connection cable linking it to the Genesis, and an additional conversion cable for the original model of the Genesis.  As well as playing its own library of cartridges, the 32X is backwards-compatible with Genesis games, and can also be used in conjunction with the Sega CD to play games that use both add-ons.   The 32X also came with a spacer so it would fit properly with the second model of the Genesis; an optional spacer was offered for use with the [[Sega Genesis#First-party models|Sega Genesis CDX]] system, but ultimately never shipped due to risks of [[electric shock]] when the 32X and CDX were connected.&lt;ref name="AllgameCDX"&gt;{{cite web|author=Marriott, Scott Alan|title=Sega Genesis CDX&amp;nbsp;– Overview|publisher=Allgame|accessdate=June 19, 2013|url=http://allgame.com/platform.php?id=17675|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141114094412/http://www.allgame.com/platform.php?id=17675|archivedate=November 14, 2014|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Installation of the 32X also requires the insertion of two included electromagnetic shield plates into the Genesis' cartridge slot.&lt;ref name="HardwareSpecs" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Allgame32X"&gt;{{cite web|author=Beuscher, David|title=Sega Genesis 32X&amp;nbsp;— Overview|publisher=[[Allgame]]|accessdate=June 7, 2013|url=http://allgame.com/platform.php?id=35|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141114094433/http://www.allgame.com/platform.php?id=35|archivedate=November 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seated on top of a Genesis, the 32X measures {{convert |115|x|210|x|100|mm|in|abbr=on}}.  The 32X contains two Hitachi SH2 32-bit [[Reduced instruction set computing|RISC]] processors with a clock speed of 23 [[hertz|MHz]],&lt;ref name="HardwareSpecs"&gt;{{cite book |title=Sega Genesis 32X instruction manual |year=1994 |publisher=[[Sega|Sega Enterprises, Ltd.]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; which Sega claimed would allow the system to work 40 times faster than a stand-alone Genesis.&lt;ref name="Kent_493_496" /&gt;  Its [[graphics processing unit]] is capable of producing 32,768 colors and rendering 50,000 [[polygon (computer graphics)|polygons]] per second, which provides a noticeable improvement over the polygon rendering of the Genesis.&lt;ref name="HardwareSpecs" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kent_493_496" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Allgame32X" /&gt;  The 32X also includes 256 [[kilobytes]] of [[random-access memory]] (RAM), along with 256 kilobytes of [[VRAM|video RAM]].  Sound is supplied through a [[pulse-width modulation]] sound source.  [[Input/output]] is supplied to a television set via a provided [[audiovisual|A/V]] cable that supplies [[composite video]] and [[stereo]] audio, or through an [[RF modulator]]. Stereo audio can also be played through [[headphones]] via a [[Headphone Jack|headphone jack]] on the attached Genesis.&lt;ref name="HardwareSpecs" /&gt;

The 32X's game library consists of forty&amp;nbsp;titles, including six that required both the Sega 32X and Sega CD.

We had to get games out for the 32X and it was going to be such a close cycle.  When ''Cosmic Carnage'' showed up, we didn't even want to ship it.  It took a lot of convincing, you know, to ship that title."&lt;ref name="Kent_493_496"/&gt;  Likewise with ''Doom'', [[id Software]]'s John Carmack rushed to have the port ready for release at the 32X's launch and had to trim out a third of the game's levels in order to meet the deadline for the port to be published on time.  Because of time limitations, game designs were intentionally conservative and did not show what the 32X hardware was able to do.&lt;ref name="Retroinspection"/&gt; In an interview at the end of 1995, Sega vice president of marketing Mike Ribero, while insisting that Sega was not abandoning the 32X, acknowledged that first party software support for the system had been lackluster: "I won't lie to you, we screwed up with 32X. We overpromised and underdelivered."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=1996 |journal=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=78|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=January 1996|pages=18–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and legacy==
[[Image:Sega-Genesis-Model-2-Monster-Bare.jpg|thumb|right|Sega Genesis with both the 32X and CD add-ons]]
Initial reception to the 32X and its games upon the launch of the add-on was very positive. Four reviewers from ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' scored the add-on 8, 7, 8, and 8 out of 10 in their 1995 Buyer's Guide, highlighting the add-on's enhancements to the Genesis but questioning how long the system would be supported.&lt;ref name="egmbuyersguide1995"&gt;{{cite journal |last= |first= |authorlink= |author2= |date=January 1995  |title=Electronic Gaming Monthly's Buyer's Guide |journal=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |volume= |issue= |pages= |id= |url= |publisher=EGM Media, LLC. |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[GamePro]]'' commented that the 32X's multiple input and power cords make it "as complicated as setting up your [[VCR]]" and noted some performance glitches with the prototype such as [[Freeze (computing)|freezes]] and overheating, but expressed confidence that the production models would perform well and gave the add-on their overall approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= |first= |title=The Return of the X|work=[[GamePro]]|issue=66|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=January 1995|page=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reviews of its launch titles, such as ''Doom'', were likewise positive.&lt;ref name="DREGM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GPDoom"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GameFan"/&gt; By late 1995, feedback to the add-on had soured. In its 1996 Buyer's Guide, ''Electronic Gaming Monthly'''s four reviewers scored the add-on 3, 3, 3, and 2 out of 10, criticizing the game library and Sega's abandonment of the system in favor of the Saturn.&lt;ref name="egmbuyersguide1996"&gt;{{cite journal |last= |first= |authorlink= |author2= |date=January 1996  |title=Electronic Gaming Monthly's Buyer's Guide |journal=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |volume= |issue= |pages= |id= |url= |publisher=EGM Media, LLC. |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A review in ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' panned the 32X for its weak polygon processing, the tendency of developers to show off its capabilities with garishly colored games, and its apparent function as "simply a way of grabbing extra 1994 mind and market share while waiting for Saturn". The review gave it one out of five stars.&lt;ref name="NGen12"&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=Which Game System is the Best!?|journal=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=12|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=December 1995|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Retrospectively, the 32X is widely criticized as having been under-supported and a poor idea in the wake of the release of the Sega Saturn.  [[1UP.com]]'s Jeremy Parish stated that the 32X "tainted just about everything it touched."&lt;ref name="1UP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/features/sega-cd-anniversary |title=20 Years Ago, Sega Gave Us the Sega CD |accessdate=December 11, 2016 |author=Parish, Jeremy |publisher=[[1UP.com]] |date=October 16, 2012 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130615202428/http://www.1up.com/features/sega-cd-anniversary |archivedate=June 15, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[GamesRadar+]] also panned the system, placing it as their ninth-worst console with reviewer Mikel Reparaz criticizing that "it was a stopgap system that would be thrown under the bus when the Sega Saturn came out six months later, and everyone seemed to know it except for die-hard Sega fans and the company itself."&lt;ref name="GamesRadar+"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamesradar.com/the-10-worst-consoles-ever/2/ |title=The 10 worst consoles ever |accessdate=June 7, 2013 |author=Reparaz, Mikel |publisher=[[GamesRadar+]] |date=February 23, 2008 |p=2 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211144809/http://www.gamesradar.com/the-10-worst-consoles-ever/2/ |archivedate=February 11, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''&lt;nowiki&gt;Retro Gamer'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''s Damien McFerran offered some praise for the power increase of the 32X to offer ports of ''Space Harrier'', ''After Burner'', and ''Virtua Fighter'' that were accurate to the original arcade versions, as well as the add-on's price point, stating, "If you didn't have deep enough pockets to afford a Saturn, then the 32X was a viable option; it's just a shame that it sold so poorly because the potential was there for true greatness."&lt;ref name="Retroinspection"/&gt;  Levi Buchanan, writing for IGN, saw some sense in the move for Sega to create the 32X but criticized its implementation.  According to Buchanan, "I actually thought the 32X was a better idea than the SEGA CD... The 32X, while underpowered, at least advanced the ball. Maybe it only gained a few inches in no small part due to a weak library, but at least the idea was the right one."&lt;ref name="32XIGN" /&gt;

In particular, the console's status as an add-on and poor timing after the announcement of the Saturn has been identified by reviewers as being responsible factors for fracturing the audience for Sega's video game consoles in terms of both developers and consumers.  Allgame notes that "[e]very add-on whittled away at the number of potential buyers and discouraged third-party companies from making the games necessary to boost sales."&lt;ref name="AllgameCD32X"&gt;{{cite web|author=Marriott, Scott Alan|title=Sega Genesis CD 32X&amp;nbsp;— Overview|publisher=Allgame|accessdate=June 7, 2013|url=http://allgame.com/platform.php?id=43|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141210111102/http://www.allgame.com/platform.php?id=43|archivedate=December 10, 2014|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''GamePro'' criticized the concept of the add-on, noting the expenses involved in purchasing the system.  According to reviewer Blake Snow, "Just how many 16-bit attachments did one need? All in all, if you were one of the unlucky souls who completely bought into Sega's add-on frenzy, you would have spent a whopping $650 for something that weighed about as much as a small dog."&lt;ref name="gamepro"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamepro.com/gamepro/domestic/games/features/111823.shtml |title=The 10 Worst-Selling Consoles of All Time |accessdate=November 25, 2007 |author=Snow, Blake |publisher=''[[GamePro]]'' |date=May 4, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070508035815/http://www.gamepro.com/gamepro/domestic/games/features/111823.shtml|archivedate=May 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Writing for GamesRadar+, Reparaz noted that "developers—not wanting to waste time on a technological dead-end—abandoned the 32X in droves. Gamers quickly followed suit, turning what was once a promising idea into an embarrassing footnote in console history, as well as an object lesson in why console makers shouldn't split their user base with pricey add-ons."&lt;ref name="GamesRadar+" /&gt;  Reparaz went on to criticize Sega's decision to release the 32X, noting that "(u)ltimately, the 32X was the product of boneheaded short-sightedness: its existence put Sega into competition with itself once the Saturn rolled out."&lt;ref name="GamesRadar+" /&gt;  Writing for IGN, Buchanan also notes that "Notice that we haven't seen many add-ons like the 32X since 1994? I think the 32X killed the idea of an add-on like this—a power booster—permanently. And that's a good thing. Because add-ons, if not implemented properly, just splinter an audience."&lt;ref name="32XIGN" /&gt;

Former executives at Sega have mixed opinions of the 32X.  Bayless believes firmly that the 32X serves as a warning to the video game industry not to risk splintering the market for consoles by creating add-ons, and was critical of the [[Kinect]] and [[PlayStation Move]] for doing so.&lt;ref name="Retroinspection"/&gt;  Franz places the 32X's commercial failure on its inability to function without an attached Genesis and lack of a CD drive, despite its compatibility with the Sega CD, stating, "The 32X was destined to die because it didn't have a CD drive and was an add-on.  An add-on device is never as well thought out as a built-from-scratch device."&lt;ref name="Retroinspection"/&gt;  Miller, on the other hand, remembers the 32X positively, stating, "I think the 32X actually was an interesting, viable platform. The timing was wrong, and certainly our ability to stick with it, given what we did with Saturn, was severely limited. There were a whole bunch of reasons why we couldn’t ultimately do what we had to do with that platform, without third party support and with the timing of Saturn, but I still think the project was a success for a bunch of other reasons. In hindsight, it was not a great idea for a whole bunch of other reasons."&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt;

'''Behavioral engineering''' is intended to identify issues associated with the interface of [[technology]] and the human operators in a system and to generate recommended design practices that consider the strengths and limitations of the human operators.
{{quote|"The behavior of the individual has been shaped according to revelations of 'good conduct' never as the result of experimental study."|[[B.F Skinner]]|''"[[Walden Two]]"''}}

Watson wrote in 1924 "Behaviorism ... holds that the subject matter of human psychology is the behavior of the human being. Behaviorism claims that consciousness is neither a definite nor a usable concept."&lt;ref&gt;Watson, J.B. (1924) ''Behaviorism''&lt;/ref&gt; 

This approach is often used in organizational behavior management, which is [[behavior analysis]] applied to organizations and behavioral community psychology.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22457">The '''Brander–Spencer model''' is an [[economics|economic]] model in [[international trade]] originally developed by [[James Brander]] and [[Barbara Spencer]] in the early 1980s. The model illustrates a situation where, under certain assumptions, a government can subsidize domestic firms to help them in their competition against foreign producers and in doing so enhances national welfare. This conclusion stands in contrast to results from most international trade models, in which government non-interference is socially optimal.

The basic model is a variation on the [[Stackelberg competition|Stackelberg]]–[[Cournot competition|Cournot]] "leader and follower" [[duopoly]] game. Alternatively, the model can be portrayed in [[game theory|game theoretic]] terms as initially a game with multiple [[Nash equilibria]], with government having the capability of affecting the payoffs to switch to a game with just one equilibrium.&lt;ref name=krugman/&gt; Although it is possible for the national government to increase a country's welfare in the model through export subsidies, the policy is of [[beggar thy neighbor]] type.&lt;ref name=chl&gt;Cohen and Lipson, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; This also means that if all governments simultaneously attempt to follow the policy prescription of the model, all countries would wind up worse off.&lt;ref name=krugman/&gt;

The model was part of the "[[New Trade Theory]]" that was developed in the late 1970s and early 1980s, which incorporated then recent developments from literature on [[industrial organization]] into theories of international trade. In particular, like in many other New Trade Theory models, [[economies of scale]] (in this case, in the form of fixed entry costs) play an important role in the Brander–Spencer model.&lt;ref name=krugman&gt;Krugman, pp. 235–236&lt;/ref&gt;

==Entry game version==

A simplified version of the model was popularized by [[Paul Krugman]] in the 1990s in his book ''[[Peddling Prosperity]]''. In this set up there are two firms, one foreign and one domestic which are considering entering a new export market in a third country (or possibly the whole world). The demand in the export market is such that if only one firm enters, it will make a profit, but if they both enter each will make a loss, perhaps because of initial set up, infrastructure, product development, marketing or other fixed costs of entry. The matrix below presents a stylized example of the game that the two firms are engaged in.&lt;ref name=krugman/&gt;

The available choices of the domestic firms are given on the left, while those of the foreign firm are on top. The first number in each cell denotes the payoff to the domestic firm while the second number is the payoff to the foreign firm.&lt;ref name=krugman/&gt;

The game with no government subsidy to the domestic firm is shown in Figure 1 on the left. If both firms enter, they each suffer a loss of 10 million dollars and if they both stay out of the market neither firm makes a profit or a loss. If only one firm enters however, that firm will realize a profit of 50 million dollars while the other firm will make nothing. The two [[Nash equilibrium|Nash equilibria]] of this game (marked in purple) are the situations in which only one firm enters – but which firm, domestic or foreign, is indeterminate. In such a situation if the foreign firm has a slight initial advantage over the domestic firm (perhaps because it began product development earlier) the domestic firm will stay out and the foreign firm will enter.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;If firms choose "[[Mixed strategies#Mixed strategy|mixed strategies]]" – that is, they choose a probability with which to enter or not – then both firms may end up erroneously entering the market. According to Krugman, that kind of situation occurred in the 1970s with both [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] and [[McDonnell Douglas]] both simultaneously entering the market for three engine [[Wide-body aircraft|wide-body jets]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=krugman/&gt;

The game changes however if the government credibly promises to subsidize the domestic firm if it enters the market, as illustrated in Figure 2. Suppose the government promises a subsidy of twenty million, regardless of whether the foreign firm also enters or not. In that case, if the foreign firm enters the domestic firm will lose ten million from entry costs but will be more than compensated by the government subsidy, ending up with a net payoff of ten million. If the foreign firm does not enter of course, it is still profitable for the domestic firm to enter. As a result, regardless of the action of the foreign firm, the domestic firm's incentive is to enter the market. Anticipating this, the foreign firm will stay out of the market itself, since otherwise it would incur a loss.&lt;ref name=krugman/&gt;

From the point of view of the domestic country, the subsidy is welfare improving. The 20 million subsidy is a transfer from the government to the firm hence it has no effect on national welfare (ignoring [[deadweight loss|costs of taxation]]; as long as these are not too large the basic insight of the model goes through). Additionally the domestic firm gains 50 million which would have otherwise gone to the foreign firm.

==Stackelberg–Cournot version==

{{See also|Cournot game|Stackelberg game}}
The original Brander and Spencer paper presented the game in the framework of a Cournot competition model.

Letting x denote the output of the domestic firm and y denote the output of the foreign firm, the [[inverse demand function]] (price as a function of total quantity) is given by &lt;math&gt;p(x+y)&lt;/math&gt;. Hence the profit function for the domestic firm is &lt;math&gt;\pi^h=xp(x+y)-c(x)+sx&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;xp(x+y)&lt;/math&gt; is total revenue, &lt;math&gt;c(x)&lt;/math&gt; is total cost of producing x units, and s is per unit subsidy provided by the government. The profit function for the foreign firm is similar except that it does not include a subsidy, &lt;math&gt;\pi^f=yp(x+y)-c(y)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=bns&gt;J. Brander and B. Spencer, [http://strategy.sauder.ubc.ca/spencer/1985JIE-ExportSubsidies.pdf "Export Subsidies and International Market Share Rivalry"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706211101/http://strategy.sauder.ubc.ca/spencer/1985JIE-ExportSubsidies.pdf# |date=2011-07-06 }}, ''Journal of International Economics'', 18, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

Each firm chooses the quantity to supply in order to maximize profits, taking the other's choice as given. The (first order) conditions for profit maximization are &lt;math&gt;xp_x+p-c_x+s=0&lt;/math&gt; for the domestic firm and &lt;math&gt;yp_{y}+p-c_{y}=0&lt;/math&gt; for the foreign firm, where subscripted variables denote [[partial derivative]]s. Solving these for y implicitly defines a [[best response function]] for each firm; &lt;math&gt;y=R1(x;s)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y=R2(x)&lt;/math&gt;. These are illustrated in the figure below, with the domestic firm's output on the x axis and foreign firm's output on the y axis.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Additional mathematical assumptions on the inverse demand function and the cost functions are needed to ensure that the above conditions define a maximum and that the reaction functions slope downward (choices are "[[strategic substitutes]]") and that they cross. The graph illustrates the case of linear demand of the form &lt;math&gt;p=a-b(x+y)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bns/&gt;

[[File:Brender spencer.JPG|center]]

With no government subsidy (s=0) the resulting equilibrium will be the standard Cournot outcome, as shown in the graph by the intersection of the best response functions. A subsidy however has the effect of shifting the domestic firm's best response function to the right. Because its output is subsidized, the domestic firm increases production. This in turn means that the foreign firm's best response is to cut output, although not proportionally (hence, the market price falls). In the new equilibrium domestic firm produces more and foreign firm produces less.&lt;ref name=bns/&gt;&lt;ref name=cns&gt;Cohen and Lipson, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

In the model, domestic social welfare can be defined as the home firm's profit net of the subsidy (the model can be extended so that social welfare includes the firm's monopoly profit as well as the wages paid to the firm's workers; the results are qualitatively the same). It can be shown that the profit function evaluated at equilibrium quantity levels is concave in s and eventually negatively sloped. As a result, there is an "optimal subsidy" which maximizes the domestic firm's profits and hence domestic social welfare. As it turns out, if the government sets the subsidy exactly at the optimal level, the resulting equilibrium is the same as that of the "leader and follower" Stackelberg model. In that case one of the firms (in this case the domestic firm) has the ability to choose its output first. This creates the ability to credibly commit to a particular action, resulting in "first mover advantage". In the Brender–Spencer model, the government's subsidy creates this credible commitment even when the private firm does not have that ability.&lt;ref name=bns/&gt;

==Extensions==

===Domestic consumption of export good===

In standard models of international trade a fall in the price of a country's [[export good]] – a deterioration in its [[terms of trade]] – generally decreases the home country's welfare. In the Brander–Spencer model however the opposite is true. This is because in this model the markets are not perfectly competitive and the revenue from the expanded quantity sold compensates the firm for the revenue lost from the lower export price. If the good produced by the firm is also consumed domestically however the result is a bit more complicated. In the case where the firm is able to separate the home and export market (charge different prices in each with no possibility of third party [[arbitrage]]) then the level of the optimal subsidies will depend on whether [[marginal cost]]s of production are constant, increasing or decreasing. The optimal subsidy level is either the same, higher or lower, respectively, compared to the level with no domestic consumption. This underscores the need on the part of the government for very precise information on industry structure and firm's cost functions.&lt;ref name=bns/&gt;

In the more general case where the firm cannot [[price discrimination|price discriminate]] between domestic and foreign consumers the effects of a subsidy are less clear since both an expansion of exports and deterioration of terms of trade are present. However, Brender and Spencer show that starting out from the position of no subsidy, introducing a small subsidy can improve a country's welfare.&lt;ref name=bns/&gt;

===Extended government game===
The basic model can be extended to incorporate a supra-game played by the governments of the respective countries. In this case, each government chooses the level of subsidy it will provide to its firm, taking the other government's action as given, and [[backward induction|anticipating the reaction]] of the firms (in terms of quantity produced) to the subsidy. Brander and Spencer show that in the resulting Nash equilibrium the governments choose a level of subsidy that is too high and hence they do not manage to maximize social welfare. In fact, if the good produced is not consumed domestically, then the optimal level of subsidy is negative – an export tax.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Brander and Spencer assume a domestic [[utility function]] of the [[Quasilinear utility|quasilinear]] form, &lt;math&gt;u(x,m)=m+U(x)&lt;/math&gt;, where m is a competitively produced [[numéraire good]]&lt;/ref&gt; This is because the total quantity produced in the Cournot and the Stackelberg equilibrium is higher than the profit maximizing collusive monopoly level of output. Since both the home and foreign firm are producing for a third market, an export tax could reduce the total quantity produced down to the monopoly level, thus increasing both firms' profits. In that way the governments can effect a collusive outcome between their firms, at the expanse of the third country which imports the good.&lt;ref name=bns/&gt;

==Policy applications and applied work==

===General difficulties===

[[File:Paul Krugman-press conference Dec 07th, 2008-8.jpg|thumb|200px|Paul Krugman popularized the model, but was also critical of it being misapplied to industries which did not meet the model's criteria.]]

As pointed out by Paul Krugman, the Brander–Spencer model, due to the sensitivity of the results to its assumptions, does not establish a generally applicable policy prescription in favor of government subsidies. Rather, it provides an example for when such intervention may be justifiable and points to some conditions which may favor it.&lt;ref name=krugman241&gt;Krugman, p. 241&lt;/ref&gt;

A general difficulty with the application of the model, like many game theoretic models, is that it does not easily lend itself to [[econometrics|econometric]] testing and parameter estimation. As a result, the two avenues of empirical research that have been pursued in subsequent literature have been estimates of a "[[conjectural variation]]" parameter for particular industries, and calibration of the models using behavioral parameters from other studies. The former approach assumes that firms have a "conjecture" as to how the other firms will react to their own choice of output and base their decision on this belief. However, the approach is problematic, both from an analytical (it is not internally consistent) and an empirical point of view (there's no guarantee that the parameter, even if it makes conceptual sense, remains stable when a new policy – the government's subsidy – is introduced&lt;ref group="note"&gt;This is the same argument as that of the [[Lucas critique]] but in a specific [[microeconomic]] setting&lt;/ref&gt;). Calibrations of models of industry structure on the other hand have generally found that most industry are neither Cournot (in which case the Brander–Spencer policy prescription would be an export subsidy) nor Bertrand (in which case the optimal policy is an export tax). As a result, it is hard to say in which industries exactly the Brander–Spencer policy prescription may apply.&lt;ref name=kns&gt;Krugman and Smith, pgs. 4–5&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agriculture===
Marie Thursby has used an extended version of the model to examine international trade in wheat, 60% of which is produced by the United States and Canada. Thursby includes [[marketing board]]s, possibility of a [[monopsony]], and a variety of government policies in the analysis. She finds that while there are significant economies of scale in the industry, the barriers to entry are not high and regardless of the extent of market power that US firms have in the industry, the optimal policy is actually an export tax, rather than a subsidy.&lt;ref name=baldwin&gt;Baldwin, pp. 98–101&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aircraft===
In his book which presented the model to the general public, Paul Krugman used the example of the aircraft industry, with the two players being [[Airbus]] and [[Boeing]].&lt;ref name=krugman/&gt; In fact, Krugman and Baldwin examined the industry for wide bodied aircraft in the context of the model in a 1988 paper. The authors calibrate an extended version of the model in order to examine the effect of a subsidy to Airbus by European governments, and its presence in a market which can only support two firms at most, worldwide. They find that the subsidy had an unambiguously negative effect on welfare of the United States and a positive effect on rest of the world, which benefits from lower prices. The result for Europe hinges on [[price elasticity of demand]]; for relatively inelastic demand the net effect of subsidy is positive with most of the benefits accruing to European consumers, but for elastic demand, social welfare in Europe goes down. Importantly, unlike in the baseline Brander and Spencer model, Krugman and Baldwin find that the changes to [[consumer surplus]] resulting from the subsidy and entry, dominate the effect of changes in firm profits in social welfare calculations.&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin, pp. 45–78 and table 3.5&lt;/ref&gt;

Gernot Klepper, in an analysis similar to Krugman and Baldwin, has also used the Brander Spencer and other models to analyze the effects of entry into the transport aircraft industry. He included the effects of [[learning by doing|learning]] during the production process which depends on the scale of production. His calibrated model suggested that per unit production costs can fall by as much as 20% if total production is doubled. In that case, the entry of another firm (in this case, Airbus) into the market would decrease per firm output and reduce the learning and scale effects. In his analysis, the entry of Airbus would cause an increase in consumer surplus, but this would be smaller than the resulting loss in producer surplus.&lt;ref name=cepr&gt;CEPR, bulletin.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

In general, like with many of the New Trade Theory models, the results of the Brander Spencer model and the policy prescriptions it generates are very sensitive to the underlying assumptions on the nature of the industry in question, the information available to the national government, its ability to credibly commit to an action and the likely response of foreign governments. Some of these criticisms were already noted by Brander and Spencer in their paper, where they advised caution.&lt;ref name=krugman/&gt;&lt;ref name=bns/&gt;

Further work on the model has shown that a slight difference in assumptions can produce completely different results. For example, Eaton and Grossmann showed that if the firms compete in prices rather in quantities ([[Bertrand competition]] rather than Cournot) then the optimal policy is an export tax rather a subsidy – a policy rarely used in practice, politically unpopular and contrary to protectionist sentiment which generally touted New Trade Theory models as an argument for their favored policies.&lt;ref name=cnl53&gt;Cohen and Lipson, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kns3&gt;Krugman and Smith, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
The 1985 paper "Export Subsidies and International Market Share Rivalry", which presented the original version of the model, was the most cited paper in the ''[[Journal of International Economics]]'' since the inception of the journal in 1971 (as of 2000).&lt;ref&gt;Robert C. Feenstra and Andy Rose: ''Journal of International Economics at Fifty: A Retrospective''. In: ''Journal of International Economics''. vol. 50, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

He grew up in largely rural Hungary and served in the Hungarian military during World War II. When Russia invaded Hungary in April 1945, he and his family fled to [[Occupation of Austria|Allied-occupied Austria]] and lived in a displaced persons camp for six years. In 1951, they emigrated to Chicago, sponsored by the Presbyterian church. Within the year his former commanding officer suggested to the U.S. government that they hire Bánáthy as a Hungarian instructor at the [[Defense Language Institute|Army Language School]] in [[Monterey, California]]. While living in Monterey, he founded the [[White Stag Leadership Development Program]]. 

His program gained national attention, and the [[Boy Scouts of America]] conducted research into incorporating leadership training into its programs. The Boy Scouts of America's [[Wood Badge (Boy Scouts of America)|Wood Badge]] and [[National Youth Leadership Training|junior leader training]] programs had until then focused primarily on [[Scoutcraft]] skills, not leadership. [[William Hillcourt|William "Green Bar Bill" Hillcourt]] among others resisted the change.

After 20 years, Bánáthy left the renamed [[Defense Language Institute]] and went to work for the [[Far West Laboratory for Educational Research and Development|Far West Laboratory for Research and Development]] in Berkeley and later San Francisco. He retired from Far West in 1989 but maintained an active interest in social systems and science, including attending many conferences and advising students and others in those fields. In 1992, he helped restart the Hungarian Scout Association within his native country. In 2003, Bánáthy and Eva moved to live with their son Tibor in Chico, California. After a brief and unexpected illness, Bánáthy died on September 4, 2003.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

== Biography ==
Béla Bánáthy was born in 1919 in [[Gyula, Hungary|Gyula]], Hungary, as the oldest of four sons. His father Peter was a minister of the [[Reformed Church in Hungary]] and his mother Hildegard Pallmann was a teacher.&lt;ref name=jenink&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Biography of Béla H.

When Bánáthy was about six years old, their family informally [[Adoption|adopted]] Tamas Feri. Tamas was about 13 years old and from a poor gardener's family. Tamas took Bánáthy on his first overnight camp out with his patrol to a small forest near [[Gyula, Hungary|Gyula]]. Bánáthy's father became the Scoutmaster of the "small scouts" troop (similar to American [[Cub Scouting (Boy Scouts of America)|Cub Scouts]]). When Bánáthy was nine years old, he became the troop leader.&lt;ref name=pinebhb /&gt;&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

The family moved about {{convert|84|km|mi}} from Bánáthy's birthplace of Gyula, to [[Makó]], Hungary, about {{convert|202|km|mi}} southeast of [[Budapest]]. He joined the regular scout program of the [[Hungarian Scout Association]] and "Csanad Vezer" Troop 92. During the 1930s, the troop had more than 50 Scouts and 30 "small scouts". They held their monthly troop meetings on Sunday in a large [[Gymnasium (school)|gimnazium]] and met weekly every Saturday as a patrol. Bánáthy reported: "Our weekly patrol meetings focused on [[scoutcraft]] and Scout spirit and guiding us to move through the various stages of advancement in rank."&lt;ref name=pinebhb /&gt;

The Hungarian Scout program had four stages. During the first three years, Bánáthy advanced three stages. The last stage required Bánáthy to earn 25 merit badges. This last stage was called [[Turul]], after the mythical bird of Hungary.&lt;ref name=pinebhb /&gt; From spring to fall, as weather permitted, the patrol had many outings. Every summer the troop went on a two- to three-week long summer camp.&lt;ref name=pinebhb /&gt; Bánáthy and his troop attended the [[4th World Scout Jamboree]] in 1933. Up until this time, he had intended to follow his father into the ministry, but changed his mind.&lt;ref name=jenink/&gt;

Bánáthy later wrote,
{{quote|The highlight of the Jamboree for me was meeting [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Baden Powell]], the Chief Scout of the World. One day, he visited our camp with the Chief Scout of Hungary, [[Count]] [[Pál Teleki]] (who later became our Prime Minister), and the chief of the camp staff, [[Vitez]] Kisbarnaki Ferenc Farkas, a general staff officer of the Hungarian Royal Army. A few years later he became the [[commander]] of the [[Ludovica Military Academy|Royal Ludovika Akademia]] (when I was a student there). In the 1940s, he became the Chief Scout of Hungary. (I was serving on his staff as head of national junior leadership training.)

For me the Jamboree became a crucial career decision point. I resolved to choose the military as a life work... There were two sources of this decision. One was my admiration of [[Lord Baden-Powell]], and his life-example as a hero of the British Army and the founder and guide of scouting. The other was the influence of Captain Varkonyi, a staff officer of the Jamboree, who was assigned to our Subcamp. We spent hours in conversation about scouting and the military as a career, as a major service in the character development of young Hungarian adults. After the Jamboree we corresponded for a while. By the end of the year I shared my decision with my parents.&lt;ref name=pinebhb&gt;{{cite web | title=Béla's Story: Scouting in Hungary, 1925-1937 |url=http://www.pinetreeweb.com/bhb.htm| author=Lew Orans| accessdate=2008-08-15| date=1996-12-14 |archivedate= February 28, 2003 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030228062045/http://pinetreeweb.com/bhb.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While at the Jamboree, Bánáthy briefly met Joseph Szentkiralyi, another Scout from Hungary. Hungarian [[Sea Scout]] Paul Ferenc Sujan and American Maurice Tripp also attended. More than 20 years later, these three men collaborated in helping Bánáthy build a leadership program for youth in the United States.

Also in 1933, Bánáthy attended the regional patrol leader training week. Later in 1934, Bánáthy and six other members of his troop traveled to the National Jamboree in Poland. They camped in a large pine forest and visited [[Kraków]] and [[Warsaw]]. The Polish government hosted a banquet for all of the Scouts in the [[Presidential Palace, Warsaw|Presidential Palace]].&lt;ref name=pinebhb /&gt;  In 1934, he was awarded the best notebook prize of the national spring leadership camp and in 1935, he was invited to serve on the junior staff of the same camp at [[Hárshegy]], [[Budapest]].&lt;ref name=pinebhb /&gt; In 1935, the troop traveled to the [[Bükk Mountains]] in northeastern Hungary for their summer camp. As a Senior Patrol leader, Bánáthy and two others took a bicycle tour in advance of the summer camp to preview the camping site.&lt;ref name=pinebhb /&gt;

In 1937, Bánáthy entered the [[:hu:Ludovika Akadémia]] as was the custom for young men aspiring to military careers.&lt;ref name=jenink/&gt; In 1940, at age 21, he was commissioned as a [[Second Lieutenant]] in the [[Mechanized infantry|armored infantry]].

The Hungarian Army expanded rapidly from an initial force of 80,000, but when fighting started, the rank-and-file of the army had undergone only eight weeks of training.&lt;ref name=mollo/&gt;

In 1941, Bánáthy's unit advanced as part of German [[Army Group South]] to within {{convert|140|km|mi}} of Moscow, during a severe November ice storm.  In 1942, as a soldier in the 109,000 strong [[Second Army (Hungary)|Second Hungarian Army]] (Second Magyar Honved), Bánáthy returned to the Russian front. They fought in the [[Battle of Voronezh (1942) |Battle of Voronezh]] at the Don River bend, supporting the German attack. They were charged with protecting the [[Italian Army in Russia|8th Italian Army's]]'s northern flank between the [[Liski, Voronezh Oblast|Novaya Pokrovka]] on the [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]] to [[Rossosh]],&lt;ref&gt;Haupt, Army Group South. p. 199&lt;/ref&gt; part of the larger force defending the drive by the [[6th Army (Wehrmacht)|German 6th Army]] against Soviet General [[Vasily Chuikov]]'s [[62nd Army (Soviet Union)|62nd Army]], which was defending [[Stalingrad]]. Bánáthy was seriously wounded during the action, and he returned from the front to Budapest where he spent seven months recuperating. He married his fiancé, Eva Balazs, with his arm in a sling on December 5, 1942 in Budapest.&lt;ref name=jenink/&gt;&lt;ref name=evanaturalization/&gt; 

Bánáthy was promoted as a [[junior officer]] of the [[Military of Hungary|Royal Hungarian Army]] and served on the faculty of the Ludovika Akademia under his mentor, [[Commandant]] Colonel-General Kisbarnaki General Farkas. Farkas sought a volunteer to teach junior leader training at the academy and Bánáthy volunteered. Farkas also asked Bánáthy to organize a Scout Troop for young men, 19 years and older, which was a common practice within the [[Magyar Cserkészszövetség|Hungarian Scout Association]] at the time.&lt;ref name="teleki"&gt;{{cite book | author = Balázs Ablonczy  | title = Pál Teleki (1879-1941)-The Life of a Controversial Hungarian Politician  | publisher =Columbia University Press  |location= New York  | year = 2006  | isbn=978-0-88033-595-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|133–134}} Bánáthy became committed to training the young men in officer's leadership skills; he served as the voluntary national director for youth leadership development and a member of the National Council of the Hungarian Scout Association.&lt;ref name=vitae/&gt;

In July 1944 Farkas was Commander of the Hungarian VI Army Corps, which had been [[garrison]]ed at [[Debrecen]]. He replaced General Beregfy, who was loyal to the fascist [[Arrow Cross Party]]. During that month, Farkas' VI Army Corp was instrumental in repelling a [[Red Army]] attack across the [[Carpathian mountains]].&lt;ref name=farkas&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hvg.hu/english/20070102_kisbarnaki_farkas.aspx| title=Was Kisbarnaki Farkas a war criminal?

He also knew he would likely be executed if captured. Bánáthy was able to get his wife Eva, one-year-old son [[Béla A. Bánáthy|Béla]] and two-week-old son László out of Budapest. Bánáthy's family, along with other officers and their families, found shelter at first in farmhouses, and later in bunkers, caves, and trenches.

When the Hungarian Second Army was disbanded on 1 December 1944 due to a lack of equipment and personnel, the remaining units of the Second Army, including Bánáthy's, were transferred to the [[Third Army (Hungary)|Third Army]]. The [[Siege of Budapest]] began when the city was encircled on 29 December 1944 by the [[Red Army]]. Bánáthy fought with the remainder of his unit against the Russians until after Budapest fell on 13 February 1945. The Axis was striving to protect the last oil fields they controlled in western Hungary around [[Lake Balaton]]. By late March 1945, most of what was left of the Hungarian Third Army was surrounded and destroyed about {{convert|40|km|mi}} to the west of Budapest in an advance by the Soviet 46th Army towards Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;Dollinger, Hans. ''The Decline and Fall of Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan.'' p 199. {{ISBN|978-0-517-12399-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining shattered units fought on as they retreated progressively westward through the [[Transdanubian Mountains]] towards Austria.

Bánáthy's family and others of the remainder of his and other military units made their way west, along with tens of thousands of other refugees, about {{convert|250|km|mi}} into Austria, trying to stay ahead of advancing Russian troops. Temperatures through the time of their flight remained near {{convert|0|C|F}}.

===Life in displaced persons camp===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-2004-0100, Bayern, Hof Moschendorf, Flüchtlingslager.jpg|thumb|Refugee family in their quarters in Bavaria after the war ended in 1945.]]

Bánáthy reunited with his family in Austria. As the war ended and [[Occupation of Austria|Austria was occupied]] in April 1945 by the French, British, Soviet and US military forces, the family was placed in an Allied [[displaced persons camp]]. They were housed in a single {{convert|6|by|10|ft|m}} room in a wooden barrack; it served as their bedroom, kitchen, living room and firewood storage area. Food was extremely scarce and at times they subsisted on around 600 calories per person per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Arthur A. |last=Noyes |title=Austrian Food Must Be Cut, UNRRA Says |date=March 7, 1946 |publisher= |url=http://www.usfava.com/USFA_Articles6c.htm#article9|work=Stars and Stripes |pages= |accessdate=2008-09-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724223427/http://www.usfava.com/USFA_Articles6c.htm |archivedate=July 24, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They were among 1.4 million displaced persons in Austria at the time&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= The Early Occupation Period|url= http://www.usarmygermany.com/Sont_USFA.htm|date= 2001-09-23|accessdate= 2009-09-11|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091205185731/http://www.usarmygermany.com/Sont_USFA.htm|archivedate= 2009-12-05|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; during a worldwide food shortage as a result of the war. Food was also severely restricted by punitive U.S. policies including [[Morgenthau Plan#JCS 1067|directive JCS 1067]]. In 1947 German citizens were surviving on 1040 calories a day, but the Allies were also suffering from food shortages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = John | last = Dietrich | title = The Morgenthau Plan: Soviet Influence on American Postwar Policy | publisher = Algora Publishing | location = New York | year = 2002 | isbn = 1-892941-90-2|pages=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bánáthy later traded for milk to give two-year-old Béla and one-year-old László enough protein. As extremely little food was available in the camps, in early 1947 his wife's twin sister came from Hungary to take their older two sons back to live with the older sister. The Pallendal family, Bánáthy's in-laws, was well-educated and relatively wealthy, so they had access to more food than what was available in the camps. They intended to return the Banathy boys to their parents within a year. Beginning in early 1948, when the [[Cold War]] ensued, it became virtually impossible for refugees or displaced persons to cross from the border of one country into another, or even from one [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany|Occupation Zone]] to another.&lt;ref name=evaobit&gt;{{cite web|title=Eva Banathy Obituary|url=http://www.brusiefh.com/obituaries/Eva-Banathy-1216-2/#!/Obituary|website=Brusie Funeral Home|accessdate=7 April 2017|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170408082650/http://www.brusiefh.com/obituaries/Eva-Banathy-1216-2/#!/Obituary|archivedate=8 April 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hqmhbk.com/current.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712224600/http://www.hqmhbk.com/current.html |archivedate=July 12, 2011|title=Current Events|last=Borbas|first=K.|translator=L.B.G.

In 1948, shortly after their third son Tibor was born, the Banathy family was moved to another camp, near a [[Marshall Plan]] warehouse. Bánáthy was assigned to unload sacks of wheat from railroad cars. He contacted the [[World Organization of the Scout Movement|World Scouting Movement]] for assistance and began to organize  [[scouting in displaced persons camps|scouting in the DP camps]]. During 1947, Bánáthy was named the Hungarian Scout Commissioner for Austria; he led training for Hungarian Scout leaders along with his former commanding officer Farkas.&lt;ref name=wshistory/&gt;  He was ordained by the [[World Council of Churches]] and became minister for youth among Hungarian refugees. Banathy served as director of religious education of the Protestant Refugee Service of Austria, was editor of a religious youth service and of a Scout publication.&lt;ref name=jenink /&gt;

In 1948 Bánáthy's fourth son Robert was born. Bánáthy soon found work as a [[Draughtsman|technical draftsman]] in the statistical office of a U.S. Army warehouse.&lt;ref name=jenink /&gt;&lt;ref name="herald"/&gt;&lt;ref name=vitae&gt;{{cite web | title = C.

Seven-year-old Béla and six-year-old László Banathy, along with their Pallendal grandmother and two aunts, were put aboard a freight train and sent toward Russia. The train stopped occasionally and a few hundred people were forced off at rural towns. The Pallendal family was ejected in eastern Hungary. There an uncle located them and hid them from authorities in a small village.{{cn|date=March 2017}}&lt;!--SEE NOTE AT "Saalfelden" ABVE.--&gt;

===Begins teaching Hungarian language===
When World War II ended, General Farkas was designated as the U.S. Army's liaison to former Hungarian [[prisoners of war]]. In 1951 he recommended Bánáthy as a [[Hungarian language]] instructor, and Bánáthy was invited to teach at the [[U.S. government]]'s [[Defense Language Institute|Army Language School]] in [[Monterey, California|Monterey]], [[California]].&lt;ref name=wshistory/&gt; Bánáthy moved to Monterey in June 1951, a pivotal change in his life. At the Army Language School, he met Joseph Szentkiralyi ([[Americanization (immigration)|Americanized]] as St. Clair), the founder of the Hungarian Department. They soon figured out they had met at the [[4th World Scout Jamboree]] in 1933. The wives of the two men also realized they had been girlhood friends in grammar school in Budapest.&lt;ref name="herald"/&gt; Using her  experience managing the Pallendal family restaurant in Budapest before World War II, Eva took work as a waitress in a restaurant on the Monterey Peninsula. Bánáthy served as President of his local [[Parent-Teacher Association]] and on the board of the local [[American Red Cross|Red Cross]].&lt;ref name=jenink /&gt; In the same year, Paul Ferenc Sujan, another former Hungarian scout, joined the language school faculty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Founders: "Uncle" Paul Sujan|url=http://www.whitestag.org/history/founders/bio_paul_sujan.html|website=www.whitestag.org|accessdate=7 April 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170321123850/http://www.whitestag.org/history/founders/bio_paul_sujan.html|archivedate=21 March 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957 Bánáthy began enlarging a concept for a leadership development program. As Council Training Chairman in the [[Monterey Bay Area Council]] of the [[Boy Scouts of America]], he received strong support from the Council Executive and Council Executive Board for his proposal to train boys in leadership skills. He was assisted by fellow Hungarians Joe Szentkiralyi (aka St. Clair, Chair of the Hungarian Language Department at the Army Language school) and Paul Sujan (Hungarian Language Instructor at the Army Language school); Fran Peterson (a member of the National Council and a Scoutmaster from Chular, California); and Maury Tripp (a Scouter from Saratoga, California, a member of the National Council, and a research scientist).&lt;ref name=wshistory /&gt;{{third party inline|date=March 2017}} "Lord Baden-Powell was my personal idol and I long felt a commitment to give back to Scouting what I had received", Bánáthy said.&lt;ref name=herald&gt;{{cite news | title=Special Leadership Camps Held at Pico Blanco | author = Helene H.

As part of his [[master's degree]] program in counseling psychology at [[San José State University]], he wrote a thesis titled "A Design for Leadership Development in Scouting".&lt;ref name="a_design"&gt;{{cite book |title = A Design for Leadership Development in Scouting |author = Béla Bánáthy |publisher = Monterey Bay Area Council |year = 1963 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This book described the founding principles of the [[White Stag Leadership Development Program|White Stag program]], which was later adapted by the National Council of the [[Boy Scouts of America]].&lt;ref name="a_report"/&gt; Prior to Bánáthy's work, the adult [[Wood Badge]] and the [[National Youth Leadership Training|junior leader training]] programs had focused on teaching [[Scoutcraft]] skills and some aspects of the [[Scout method|Patrol Method]]. His research and findings on teaching principles and competencies of leadership had a huge impact on these two programs, shifting their focus to leadership skills.&lt;ref name=barnardhistory&gt;{{cite web |title=History of Wood Badge in the United States |url=http://www.woodbadge.org/history.html |year=2002 |author=Mike Barnard |work=Wood Badge.org |accessdate=April 6, 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161206114428/http://www.woodbadge.org/history.html |archivedate=December 6, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bsawbhistory"&gt;{{cite book |title=A History of Wood Badge in the United States|asin=B0013ENRE8|publisher=Boy Scouts of America|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some individuals on the national staff and many volunteers across the nation resisted the idea of changing the focus of Wood Badge from training leaders in Scoutcraft to leadership skills. Among them was [[William Hillcourt|William "Green Bar Bill" Hillcourt]], who had been the first United States Wood Badge Course Director in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Green Bar Bill Hillcourt's Impact on Wood Badge |url=http://www.woodbadge.org/hillcourt.html |year=2001 |author=Mike Barnard |work=Wood Badge.org |accessdate=March 18, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100316152939/http://www.woodbadge.org/hillcourt.html |archivedate=March 16, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although officially retired, he had many loyal followers. He was adamant that Wood Badge should continue to teach Scoutcraft skills and tried to persuade the national council to stick to that tradition, but his objections were ignored.&lt;ref name=wshistory/&gt;

The leadership competencies Banathy articulated became the ''[[de facto]]'' method for Scout adult and junior leader training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Troop Leader Development Staff Guide |publisher=Boy Scouts of America|year=1974|pages=94–95}}&lt;/ref&gt; (In 2008, the White Stag program celebrated its 50th anniversary.) In 1960, the Monterey Bay Area Council recognized Béla for his exceptional service to youth and awarded him the [[Silver Beaver]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jim|first=Himlyn|title=Image History of the Monterey Bay Area Council Silver Beaver Recipients|url=http://himlyn.com/mbac_history/silverbeaver.html|accessdate=11 September 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320224723/http://himlyn.com/mbac_history/silverbeaver.html|archivedate=20 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, due to the success of the White Stag program, Bánáthy was appointed to the [[Interamerican Scout Region (World Organization of the Scout Movement)|Interamerican Scout Committee]] and participated in three interamerican "Train the Trainer" events in [[Scouting in Mexico|Mexico]], [[Scouting in Costa Rica|Costa Rica]], and [[Scouting in Venezuela|Venezuela]].&lt;ref name=jenink /&gt; He guided their national training teams in designing leadership development by design programs. Béla also taught in [[Sunday School]] and was on the Board of the [[United Methodist Church]] of the Wayfarer in [[Carmel, California]].

===Systems science===

In the 1960s Bánáthy began teaching courses in [[applied linguistics]] and [[systems science]] at [[San José State University]]. In 1962 he was named Dean and Chairman of the East Europe and Middle East Division at the Army Language School, overseeing ten language departments. In 1963 he completed his master's degree in [[psychology]] at San Jose State University, and in 1966 he received a [[doctorate]] in [[education]] for a [[transdisciplinary]] program in education, systems theory, and linguistics from the [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California]] in Berkeley. During the mid-1960s Bánáthy was named Chair of Western Division of the [[International Society for the Systems Sciences|Society for General Systems Research]]. He published his first book, ''Instructional Systems,'' in 1968.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;&lt;ref name=jenink/&gt;

===Large complex systems===

During the 1960s and 1970s, Bánáthy was a visiting professor at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], and as he continued teaching at San Jose State University. In 1969, he left the renamed Defense Language Institute and became a Program Director, and later Senior Research Director and Associate Laboratory Director, at the [[Far West Laboratory for Educational Research and Development|Far West Laboratory for Research and Development]] (now [[WestEd]]) in Berkeley (later moved to San Francisco). He "directed over fifty research and development programs, designed many curriculum projects and several large scale [[complex system]]s, including the design and implementation of a Ph.D. program in educational research and development for [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]]".&lt;ref name=ifsr/&gt;&lt;ref name=jenink/&gt;&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

In the 1970s and 1980s, he focused his research on the application of systems and design theories and methodologies in social, social service, educational, and human development systems. In the 1980s he developed and guided a Ph.D. curriculum in humanistic systems inquiry and social systems design for the [[Saybrook Graduate School]].&lt;ref name=ifsr/&gt;&lt;ref name=jenink/&gt;&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

=== International Systems Institute ===

In 1981, he founded the International Systems Institute&lt;ref name="ISI"/&gt; (ISI), a non-profit, public benefit scientific and educational corporation in [[Carmel, California]], USA. He organized its first meeting at [[Fuschl am See]], [[Austria]] in 1982.&lt;ref name="ISI"/&gt;&lt;ref name=ifsr/&gt;

Banathy introduced a unique and never-before used approach to organizing the International Systems Institute conferences. Banathy observed that in traditional conferences, a few usually well-respected or prestigious individuals would apply to present "pre-packaged new ideas" to others. In typical conferences, presenting almost always carries more prestige than listening; the few presenters share their wisdom with the many. This one-to-many or "hierarchical knowledge distribution system" slowed the sharing and spreading of ideas about which many people cared deeply if not passionately, as there was always limited opportunity for interchange among participants. This interaction was usually wedged into the interstices of the formal schedule in the form of informal, spontaneous gatherings for which no record existed.&lt;ref name="ISI"/&gt;

The notion that presenting is more important than listening aroused lifelong antipathy in Bánáthy. When he formulated the leadership competencies of the [[White Stag Leadership Development Program]] in the 1960s, he described the passing of knowledge from one to another as "Manager of Learning". He wrote extensively about how the focus should be on the learner, not the teacher.&lt;ref name="a_report"&gt;{{cite book | title = Report on a Leadership Development Experiment| author = Béla Banathy| publisher = Monterey Bay Area Council | year = 1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bánáthy advanced a different vision for conferences, one that would allow everyone to fully engage. He proposed that everyone be given the opportunity to prepare and distribute papers to all participants in advance of the conference. And instead of listening to speeches, conference attendees took part in extended, non-hierarchical conversations about the conference papers. The conference proceedings were the result of these conversations.  Bánáthy felt strongly that systems scholars from all over the world should be given ongoing opportunities to engage in extended conversations so they might put their expertise "actively into the service of humanity worldwide".&lt;ref name="ISI"/&gt;

Bánáthy wrote: "We aspire to reap the 'reflecting and creating power' of groups that emerge in the course of disciplined and focused conversations on issues that are important to us and to our society". Participants at International Systems Institute gatherings have, since the original meeting organized by Bánáthy in 1982, organized them around this principle and referred to them as "conversations".&lt;ref name="ISI"/&gt;

===General Evolutionary Research Group===
In 1984, Bánáthy was co-founder with general evolution theorist [[Ervin László]] and others of the initially secret General Evolutionary Research Group, or General Evolutionary Research Group.&lt;ref name="GERG" /&gt; A member of the [[International Society for the Systems Sciences|Society of General Systems Research]] since the 1960s, he was Managing Director of the Society in the early 1980s, and in 1985 he became its president.&lt;ref name="ISI"/&gt; He then served on its Board of Trustees. During the 1980s, he served on the Executive Committee of the [[International Federation of Systems Research]].&lt;ref name="GERG" /&gt; In 1989, he retired from Far West Labs and returned to live on the Monterey Peninsula. He continued to serve as Professor Emeritus for the Saybrook Graduate School, counseling Ph.D. students. He also continued his work with the annual ISI international systems design conversations, and authored a number of articles and books about systems, design, and evolutionary research. He served two terms as president of the International Federation of Systems Research during 1994-98.&lt;ref name=jenink /&gt;

He coordinated over twenty international systems research conferences held in eight countries, including the 1994 Conversation on Systems Design conversation held at Fuschl Am See, Austria, sponsored by the International Federation of Systems Research.&lt;ref name=ifsr/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ifsr.org/node/33 Fuschl Conversations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017153101/http://www.ifsr.org/node/33 |date=2008-10-17 }}."

==Final years==

In 1992, Bánáthy, a long-standing member of the Hungarian Scout Association Abroad ([[Külföldi Magyar Cserkészszövetség]]), traveled from his [[Monterey, California]] home in the United States to Hungary following its renewed freedom. There, he helped restart the Hungarian Scout Association within his native country.&lt;ref name=wshistory&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitestag.org/history/history.html |title=White Stag History Since 1933 |first1=Joe |last1=St. Clair |first2=Alan |last2=Miyamoto |first33=Fran |last3=Peterson |accessdate=2008-10-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920115949/http://www.whitestag.org/history/history.html |archivedate=2008-09-20 |df= }}{{third party inline|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{third party inline|date=March 2017}}

Bánáthy spent considerable time during the last few years of his life caring for his wife Eva in their home in [[Carmel, California]]. She had been in poor health for a number of years after a stroke. In the summer of 2003 Bánáthy and his wife moved to live with their son Tibor in [[Chico, California]]. After a brief and unexpected illness, Bánáthy died on September 4, 2003. He and Eva had been married 64 years at the time of his death.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;&lt;!--THIS OBIT APPEARS FINE, AS IT IS A REPRINT OF AN INDEPENDENTLY PUBLISHED NEWS ARTICLE.--&gt;

The  '''''Calculus ratiocinator''''' is a theoretical universal logical calculation framework, a concept described in the writings of [[Gottfried Leibniz]], usually paired with his more frequently mentioned ''[[characteristica universalis]]'', a universal conceptual language.

==Two views==
There are two contrasting points of view on what Leibniz meant by ''calculus ratiocinator''. The first is associated with [[computer software]], the second is associated with [[computer hardware]].

=== The analytic view ===
*The received point of view in [[analytic philosophy]] and formal [[logic]], is that the ''calculus ratiocinator'' anticipates [[mathematical logic]]&amp;mdash;an "algebra of logic".&lt;ref&gt;Fearnley-Sander 1982: p.164&lt;/ref&gt; The analytic point of view understands that the ''calculus ratiocinator'' is a formal [[inference engine]]&lt;!--what makes an inference engine formal or informal--&gt; or [[computer program]], which can be designed so as to grant primacy to calculations. That logic began with [[Frege]]'s 1879 ''[[Begriffsschrift]]'' and [[Charles Sanders Peirce|C.S. Peirce]]'s writings on logic in the 1880s. [[Frege]] intended his "concept script" to be a ''calculus ratiocinator'' as well as a ''[[lingua characteristica]]''. That part of formal logic relevant to the calculus comes under the heading of [[proof theory]]. From this perspective the ''calculus ratiocinator'' is only a part (or a subset) of the ''[[universal characteristic]]'', and a complete ''universal characteristic'' includes a "logical calculus".

=== The synthetic view ===
*A contrasting point of view stems from [[Herbert Spencer#Synthetic philosophy|synthetic philosophy]] and fields such as [[cybernetics]], [[electronic engineering]] and [[general systems theory]]. It is little appreciated in analytic philosophy. The synthetic view understands the ''calculus ratiocinator'' as referring to a "calculating machine". The cybernetician [[Norbert Wiener]] considered Leibniz's ''calculus ratiocinator'' a forerunner to the modern day digital computer:

{{cquote|The history of the modern computing machine goes back to Leibniz and Pascal. Indeed, the general idea of a computing machine is nothing but a mechanization of Leibniz's ''calculus ratiocinator''. (Wiener 1948: 214)}}

{{cquote|...like his predecessor Pascal, [Leibniz] was interested in the construction of computing machines in the Metal. ... just as the [[calculus of arithmetic]] lends itself to a mechanization progressing through the abacus and the desk computing machine to the utra-rapid computing machines of the present day, so the ''calculus ratiocinator'' of Leibniz contains the germs of the ''[[machina ratiocinatrix]]'', the reasoning machine (Wiener 1965: 12)}}

Leibniz constructed just such a machine for mathematical calculations, which was also called a [[Stepped Reckoner]]. As a computing machine, the ideal ''calculus ratiocinator'' would perform Leibniz's integral and differential calculus. In this way the meaning of the word, "ratiocinator" is clarified and can be understood as a mechanical instrument that combines and compares ratios.
&lt;gallery class="center"&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Hartley Rogers saw a link between the two, defining the ''calculus ratiocinator'' as "an algorithm which, when applied to the symbols of any formula of the characteristica universalis, would determine whether or not that formula were true as a statement of science" (Hartley Rogers, Jr. 1963; p.&amp;nbsp;934).

A classic discussion of the ''calculus ratiocinator'' is Couturat (1901: chapters 3 and 4), who maintained that the ''characteristica universalis''—and thus the ''calculus ratiocinator''—were inseparable from Leibniz's encyclopedic project (chapter 5). Hence the ''characteristic'', ''calculus ratiocinator'', and encyclopedia form three pillars of Leibniz's project.

Community Change, formerly The '''Center for Community Change''' ('''CCC'''), is a [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] [[community organizing]] group active in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://billmoyers.com/content/deepak-bhargava/|title=Activists to Watch: Deepak Bhargava|date=October 24, 2013|publisher=Moyers &amp; Company|last1=Dreier|first1=Peter|accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded in 1968 in response to civil rights concerns of the 1960s and to honor [[Robert F.

==Activities==
Community Change generally works in low-income areas, especially within communities of color, and attempts to create resident-based groups to work on local issues of concern. The organization sponsors internships and training programs in several areas, including [[community organizing]], [[service learning]], [[union organizing]], electoral engagement, and youth/student organizing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/12/fashion/12organizer.html?_r=2|title=Community Organizing Never Looked So Good|date=April 10, 2009|publisher=New York Times|last1=Rimer|first1=Sara|accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization provides resources for grassroots groups including campaign strategy, funding and social media strategy. In 2004, through the collaboration with immigrant groups, Community Change organized the Fair Immigration Reform Movement that "empowered immigrants to speak out."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stolz|first=Rich|year=2011|title=Lessons For The Future Of Immigration Reform|url=|journal=Social Policy|volume=41.3|pages=4–19|via=Education Source}}&lt;/ref&gt; Community Change has helped to create government programs like the [[Community Reinvestment Act]] and the [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program|food stamps program]].&lt;ref name="poverty22"&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of World Poverty, Volume 1|date=2006|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=9781452265186|page=134|last1=Odekon|first1=Mehmet}}&lt;!--|accessdate=24 April 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization seeks to create workplace environments that value family, to guarantee minimum wage, "unlock opportunities in the poorest communities, and increase income taxes for the wealthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leong|first=F|last2=Tang|first2=M|year=2016|title=Career Barriers for Chinese Immigrants in the United States|url=|journal=Career Development Quarterly|volume=64.3|pages=259–271|via=Education Source}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Center for Community Change launched the [[Fair Immigration Reform Movement]] (FIRM), an immigration reform movement working for comprehensive immigration reform. FIRM received funding from the [[Open Society Foundations]] and the [[Ford Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/about/programs/us-programs/grantees/center-community-change-fair-immigration-reform-movement|title=Center for Community Change / Fair Immigration Reform Movement|publisher=Open Society Foundations|accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordfoundation.org/grants/grantdetails?grantid=121322|title=Center for Community Change|publisher=Ford Foundation|accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10895">'''The Center for Research-Action on Race Relations (CRARR)''' is a Canadian, [[Non-profit organization|non-profit]] [[civil rights]] organization committed to promoting racial harmony and [[social equality|equality]]. The organization functions as a service for victims of [[discrimination]] through activities involving [[advocacy]], [[research]] and [[legal representation]]. It is considered a leader among non-profit organizations of its type in [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;CRARR. "Our Mandate and Services." Centre for Research-Action on Race Relations. 21 Feb 2010. http://www.crarr.org/?q=node/1&lt;/ref&gt;

The CRARR has supported and assisted over 250 victims of discrimination since its inception in 1983. It takes on approximately 75 new cases per year.&lt;ref&gt;CRARR. "Services for Victims of Discrimination." Centre for Research-Action on Race Relations. 21 Feb 2010. http://www.crarr.org/?q=node/15&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of individuals aided come from the [[Montreal]] area, however, assistance is not limited to this region.

==History==

The organization was founded in 1983 in Montreal, [[Quebec]], Canada and while it has expanded the reach of its work to other parts of Canada, it maintains its base in Montreal.&lt;ref&gt;CRARR. "Our Mandate and Services."  Centre for Research-Action on Race Relations. 21 Feb 2010. http://www.crarr.org/?q=node/1&lt;/ref&gt; It was co-founded by Fo Niemi, who has maintained the title of [[executive director]] since the organization’s creation.

==Mission statement==

	The organization’s motto is "United for Diversity and Racial Equality." Its mandate, broadly speaking, is "to promote racial harmony and equality in Canada".&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt;
The organization is actively engaged in promoting equality and multicultural representation in Canada through various activities. As such, the CRARR has a strong commitment to promoting [[racial equality]], believing that "When it comes to real inclusion—real integration, real presence in decision-making positions—we still have a fairly long way to go".&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Reilly, et al., eds. Racism: A Global Reader. (Armonk, NY: M.E. Sharpe, 2002) 334&lt;/ref&gt; This position demonstrates the organization’s belief that underrepresentation of minorities is a [[social injustice]] that must be corrected.

The CRARR’s areas of expertise include discrimination and [[harassment]] in employment; discrimination in school discipline; [[hate crime]]s and hate incidents; hate on the [[internet]]; [[homophobia]]; [[media bias]]; [[racial profiling]] in public services and employment; systemic [[racism]] and critical race analysis and union misrepresentation.&lt;ref&gt;CRARR. "Services for Victims of Discrimination." Centre for Research-Action on Race Relations. 21 Feb 2010. http://www.crarr.org/?q=node/15&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current activities==

'''i. Services and Activities''' &lt;br /&gt;
The organization’s goals are largely focused on policy interventions, [[public education]] and mobilization, promotion and recognition, research-action, and training and consulting. More specifically, the organization offers a wide range of services and activities, including:

{{quote|
a.	Advocacy and defence for victims of discrimination based on race, religion, ethnic or national origin, [[citizenship]] status and related characteristics.

b.	Charter research and litigation on racial equality issues

c.	Conferences, consultations and seminars on different [[race relations]] and equality rights issues

d.	Research-action projects on systemic racism and on racial minorities’ needs

e.	Interventions and advocacy before legislative, administrative, regulatory and judicial agencies.&lt;ref&gt;Media Awareness Network. "Center for Research-Action on Race Relations." 2010. Media Awareness Network. 19 Feb 2010. {{cite web |url=http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/resources/profiles/advocacy/crarr_profile.cfm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100117054515/http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/resources/profiles/advocacy/crarr_profile.cfm |archivedate=2010-01-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In addition, the organization also honours an individual or non-profit organization with its bi-annual Frederick Johnson award. Past recipients include Hank Avery, African-Canadian who pushed for the recognition of a black slave’s cemetery in Quebec,&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt; the organization Mothers United Against Racism and Hon. [[Irwin Cotler]], Canada’s former Minister of Justice and Attorney-General.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations, Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. Questions from the Center for Research-Action on Race Relations. (Geneva: 2007) 6. http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cerd/docs/ngos/crarr.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004-2005, the CRARR hosted a conference on [[youth crime]] prevention. Additionally, the organization hosts an annual lecture on Diversity in Canadian Media that is co-sponsored by the department of Communication Studies at [[Concordia University (Quebec)|Concordia University]] in Montreal.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations 6&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ii. Recent Activities'''&lt;br /&gt;
The CRARR, represented by Civil Rights Advocate Elena Toews, is currently assisting two groups of black residents of Southwest Montreal who have filed claims with the Quebec Human Rights Commission. The individuals, Samantha Hyman-Roberts and Gallo Cham, have claimed that they were both racially profiled and [[abuse]]d by [[Transit authority|transit authorities]] after failing to show proof that they had purchased transit tickets. Both Hyman-Roberts and Cham are asking for $50,000 and $30,000, respectively. The complaints are currently in the process of being filed on behalf of the individuals by the CRARR.&lt;ref&gt;Irwin Block, "Black Montreal Residents claim racial profiling on transit," Montreal Gazette. 21 Feb 2010 https://montrealgazette.com/life/Black+Montreal+residents+claim+racial+profiling+transit/2594810/story.html{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''iii. Past Successes'''&lt;br /&gt;
The CRARR has been granted [[intervention (law)|intervener]] status in two discrimination cases reviewed by the [[Supreme Court of Canada]]. One was [[Lavoie v. Canada]] (2002) which discussed giving preference to citizens over non-citizens for government jobs. As intervener, the CRARR argued that the practice was discriminatory and "the preference operated in a particularly invidious way with respect to women." The CRARR argued that many women keep foreign citizenship out of practical considerations, such as maintain the ability to return to their former country to take care of elderly parents.&lt;ref&gt;Daphne Gilbert. "Time to Regroup: Rethinking Section 15 of the Charter." McGill Law Journal. 2003, 48:639. 25 Feb 2010. {{cite web|url=http://lawjournal.mcgill.ca/documents/Gilbert.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706185352/http://lawjournal.mcgill.ca/documents/Gilbert.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reality that citizens receive preference over non-citizens is contrary to the federal [[action plan]], Embracing Change, that was created in 2000 to increase the representation of visible minorities in the federal public service which can often include non-citizens.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations 2&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the organization has also achieved the following:

-intervened in a number of cases before the [[Canadian Human Rights Commission|Canadian]] and Quebec Human Rights Commissions and helped victims of racism receive over $400,000 in damages through various [[court case]]s
-won a case before the [[Canadian Human Rights Tribunal]] against a man in [[British Columbia]] who was affiliated with a [[neo-Nazi]] website
-aided a number of individuals in filing complaints against discriminatory and unethical [[police]] and transit authority behavior.&lt;ref&gt;CRARR. "Services for Victims of Discrimination." Centre for Research-Action on Race Relations. 21 Feb 2010.  http://www.crarr.org/?q=node/15&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current Organizational Features==

'''i. Employees/Volunteers'''&lt;br /&gt;
	The staff currently consists of three people led by the executive director, Fo Niemi, who co-founded the organization in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;CRARR. "Executive Director." Centre for Research-Action on Race Relations. 20 Feb 2010. http://www.crarr.org/?q=node/65&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the executive director, the organization also has a counsellor for victims of discrimination, a legal counsellor and a communication and research officer.&lt;ref&gt;CRARR. "The CRARR Team." Centre for Research-Action on Race Relations. 20 Feb 2010. http://www.crarr.org/?q=node/10&lt;/ref&gt;
The organization attracts [[intern]]s who study in [[law]], [[political science]], [[social work]] and [[communications]]. At least six lawyers are associated with and work closely to the rest of the CRARR team in addition to a number of other experts across Canada who lend their expertise and advice to the organization.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations 6&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ii. Funding'''&lt;br /&gt;
	As a non-profit organization, the CRARR receives funding from a range of both public and private institutions. This includes the government of Canada, businesses, unions, educational institutions, as well as donations from private individuals.&lt;ref&gt;CRARR. "Our Mandate and Services."  Centre for Research-Action on Race Relations. 21 Feb 2010.  http://www.crarr.org/?q=node/1&lt;/ref&gt;
	In 2007, the organization received a contribution from Canada’s Department of Justice in the amount of $67,000 CAD.&lt;ref&gt;Government of Canada, Department of Justice. Disclosure of Grant and Contribution Awards Over $25,000. (Ottawa: 2007). http://justice.gc.ca/eng/dept-min/pd-dp/gc-sc/details.asp?yr=20072008&amp;q=Q3&amp;id=9042{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''iii. Partners'''&lt;br /&gt;
	The CRARR is affiliated with a number of governmental and non-governmental actors. Governmental parties include the Department of Canadian Heritage, Human
Resources and Skills Development Canada, the Ministry of Immigration and Cultural
Communities of Quebec, the National Crime Prevention Strategy and the Secrétariat à l’action communautaire autonome du Québec.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations 6&lt;/ref&gt; Some non-governmental partners include the [[Royal Bank of Canada]], Banque Nationale, CHUM Ltd., [[Canadian Auto Workers]], the National Council of Visible Minorities in the Federal Public Service, the [[Canadian Jewish Congress]], and the [[Canadian Race Relations Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;United Nations 6&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Wikiquote}}'''Consent''' occurs when one person voluntarily agrees to the proposal or desires of another.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/39517?rskey=7YN1Zi&amp;result=1#eid|title=Home : Oxford English Dictionary|website=www.oed.com|access-date=2016-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;   It is a term of common speech, but may have more specific definitions in such fields as the law, medicine, research, and sexual relationships.  

Types of consent include [[implied consent]], expressed consent, [[informed consent]] and [[unanimous consent]].  Consent as understood in specific contexts may differ from its  everyday meaning. For example, a person with a [[mental disorder]], a low [[mental age]], or under the legal [[age of sexual consent]] may willingly engage in a sexual act that still fails to meet the legal threshold for consent as defined by applicable law. UN agencies and initiatives in sex education programs believe that teaching the topic of consent as part of a [[Comprehensive sex education|comprehensive sexuality education]] is beneficial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0026/002607/260770e.pdf|title=International technical guidance on sexuality education: An evidence-informed approach|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2018|isbn=978-92-3-100259-5|location=Paris|pages=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
*[[Implied consent]] is a form of consent which is not expressly granted by a person, but rather inferred from a person's actions and the facts and circumstances of a particular situation (or in some cases, by a person's silence or inaction). Some examples include implied consent to follow rules and/or regulations at an education institution and the implied consent to physical contact by participants in a hockey game.
*Expressed consent is clearly and unmistakably stated, rather than implied. It may be given in [[writing]], by [[spoken words|speech]] (orally), or [[nonverbal communication|non-verbally]], e.g. by a clear gesture such as a nod. Non-written express consent not evidenced by witnesses or an audio or video recording may be disputed if a [[Party (law)|party]] denies that it was given.
*[[Informed consent]] in medicine is consent given by a person who has a clear appreciation and understanding of the facts, implications, and future consequences of an action. The term is also used in other contexts, such as in social scientific research, when participants are asked to affirm that they understand the research procedure and consent to it.
*[[Unanimous consent]], or general consent, by a group of several parties (e.g., an [[Voluntary association|association]]) is consent given by all parties.
*Substituted consent, or the substituted judgment doctrine, allows a decision maker to attempt to establish the decision an incompetent person would have made if he or she were competent.&lt;ref name="sub"&gt;{{cite book |last=Garner |first=Bryan |date=2011 |title=Black's Law Dictionary |url= |location= |publisher=West Publishing Co. |page=726 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tort==
{{Main|Tort}}
Consent can be either expressed or implied. For example, participation in a [[contact sport]] usually implies consent to a degree of contact with other participants, implicitly agreed and often defined by the rules of the sport.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/rules_and_equipment/4200680.stm  Example of permitted and regulated contact in sport - BBC Sport: Rugby Union: "... you can tackle an opponent in order to get the ball, as long as you stay within the rules."]&lt;/ref&gt; Another specific example is where a boxer cannot complain of being punched on the nose by an opponent; implied consent will be valid where the violence is '''ordinarily and reasonably to be contemplated as incidental to the sport in question'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|VicRp|29|1976|litigants=Pallante v Stadiums Pty Ltd (No 1) |parallelcite=[1976] [[Victorian Reports|VR]] 331 at 339 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Express consent exists when there is oral or written agreement, particularly in a contract. For example, businesses may require that persons [[Digital signature|sign]] a [[waiver]] (called a [[liability waiver]]) acknowledging and accepting the hazards of an activity. This proves express consent, and prevents the person from filing a [[tort]] lawsuit for unauthorised actions.

In [[English law]], the principle of ''[[volenti non fit injuria]]'' applies not only to participants in sport, but also to spectators and to any others who willingly engage in activities where there is a risk of injury. Consent has also been used as a defense in cases involving [[Death during consensual sex|accidental deaths during sex]], which occur during [[Bondage (BDSM)|sexual bondage]]. ''[[Time Magazine|Time]]'' (May 23, 1988) referred to this latter example, as the "''rough-sex defense''". It is not effective in English law in cases of serious injury or death.

As a term of jurisprudence prior provision of consent signifies a possible defence (an [[excuse]] or justification) against civil or criminal liability. [[Defendant]]s who use this [[defense (legal)|defense]] are arguing that they should not be held [[legal liability|liable]] for a tort or a [[crime]], since the [[action (philosophy)|actions]] in question took place with the plaintiff or "victim's" prior consent and permission.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

==Medicine==
{{see also| Informed consent}}

The question of consent is important in medical law. For example, a medical practitioner may be liable for harm to a patient by a procedure which was not consented to. There are [[Doe ex. rel. Tarlow v. District of Columbia|exemptions]], such as when the patient is unable to give consent.&lt;ref name="sub"/&gt;

Also, a medical practitioner must explain the significant risks of a procedure (those that might change the patient's mind about whether or not to have it) before the patient can give binding consent. This was explored in Australia in ''Rogers v Whitaker''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|58|1992|litigants=Rogers v Whitaker |parallelcite=(1992) 175 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 479 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; If a practitioner does not explain a material risk that subsequently eventuates, then that is considered negligent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII |litigants=[[Chester v Afshar]] |year=2004 |court=UKHL |num=41 |parallelcite= [2005] 1 [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 134 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These material risks include the loss of chance of a better result if a more experienced surgeon had performed the procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|55|1998|litigants=Chappel v Hart |parallelcite=(1998) 195 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 232 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the [[UK]], a [[Supreme Court]] judgment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII |litigants=Montgomery v Lanarkshire Health Board |courtname=auto|juris=Scotland |court=UKSC |year=2015 |num=11 |parallelcite=[2015] [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 1430}}.&lt;/ref&gt; modernised the law on consent and introduced a patient-focused test to UK law: allowing the patient rather than the medical professionals to decide upon the level of risk they wish to take in terms of a particular course of action, given all the information available.  This change reflects the Guidance of the General Medical Council on the requirement to consent patients, and removes the rule of medical paternalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Supreme Court decision changes doctor-patient relationship forever - Balfour+Manson|url=https://www.balfour-manson.co.uk/news-plus-events/news/2015/03/mothers-landmark-court-win-changes-doctor-patient-relationship-forever/|website=www.balfour-manson.co.uk|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social science research ==
[[Social science|Social scientists]] are generally required to obtain informed consent from [[Research participant|research participants]] before asking interview questions or conducting an experiment. Federal law governs social science research that involves [[Human subject research|human subjects]], and tasks [[Institutional review board|institutional review boards]] (IRBs) at universities, federal or state agencies, and tribal organizations to oversee social science research that involves human subjects and to make decisions about whether or not informed consent is necessary for a social scientific study to go forward. Informed consent in this context generally means explaining the study's purpose to research participants and obtaining a signed or verbal affirmation that the study participants understand the procedures to be used and to consent to participate in the study.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|51-55}} 

Some types of social scientific research, such as psychological experiments, may use deception as part of the study; in these cases, researchers may not fully describe the procedures to participants, and thus participants are not fully informed. However, researchers are required to debrief participants immediately after the experiment is concluded. Certain populations are considered to be vulnerable, and in addition to informed consent, special protections must be made available to them. These include persons who are incarcerated, pregnant women, persons with disabilities, and persons who have a mental disability. Children are considered unable to provide informed consent.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/890179806|title=Making sense of the social world: methods of investigation|last=Chambliss|first=Daniel F.|last2=Schutt|first2=Russell K.|publisher=Sage|others=|year=2016|isbn=9781483380612|edition=Fifth|location=Los Angeles|pages=|oclc=890179806}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|51-55}}

==Planning law==
Some countries, such as [[New Zealand]] with its [[Resource Management Act 1991|Resource Management Act]] and its [[Building Act]], use the term "consent" for the legal process that provide planning permission for developments like subdivisions, bridges or buildings. Achieving permission results in getting "Resource consent" or "Building consent".

==Sexual activity==

{{see also| Sexual consent|Rape#Consent|Consent (criminal law)}}

In Canada "consent means…the voluntary agreement of the complainant to engage in sexual activity" without abuse or exploitation of "trust, power or authority", coercion or threats.&lt;ref name=canadiancriminalcode&gt;{{cite journal|last=Criminal Code|first=Canadian|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-137.html#docCont|title=‘Canadian Criminal Code’|date=2015}} Retrieved March 13, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Consent can also be revoked at any moment.&lt;ref name=Hall&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hall|first=David S.|title=‘Consent for Sexual Behavior in a College Student Population’|journal=Electronic Journal of Human Sexuality|date=10 August 1998|volume=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual consent plays an important role in defining what sexual assault is, since [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]] without consent by all parties is considered [[rape]].&lt;ref name=Roffee/&gt;&lt;ref name=Beres&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beres. A|first=Melanie|title='Spontaneous' Sexual Consent: An Analysis of Sexual Consent Literature|journal=Feminism &amp; Psychology|date=18 January 2007|volume=17|issue=93|page=93|doi=10.1177/0959353507072914}}&lt;!--|accessdate=28 October 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1980s, academic Lois Pineau argued that we must move towards a more communicative model of sexuality so that consent becomes more explicit and clear, objective and layered, with a more comprehensive model than "no means no" or "yes means yes".&lt;ref name=PINEAU&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pineau|first=Lois|title=‘Date Rape: A Feminist Analysis’|journal=Law and Philosophy|year=1989|volume=8|issue=217}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many universities have instituted campaigns about consent. Creative campaigns with attention-grabbing slogans and images that market consent can be effective tools to raise awareness of campus sexual assault and related issues.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas KA, Sorenson SB, Joshi M. "Consent is good, joyous, sexy": A banner campaign to market consent to college students. Journal of American College Health. 2016; 64(8):639-650&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the late 1990s, new models of sexual consent have been proposed. Specifically, the development of "yes means yes" and affirmative models, such as Hall's definition: "the voluntary approval of what is done or proposed by another; permission; agreement in opinion or sentiment."&lt;ref name=Hall/&gt; Hickman and Muehlenhard state that consent should be "free verbal or nonverbal communication of a feeling of willingness' to engage in sexual activity."&lt;ref&gt;Hickman, S.E. and Muehlenhard, C.L. (1999) '"By the Semi-mystical Appearance of a Condom": How Young Women and Men Communicate Sexual Consent in Heterosexual Situations', The Journal of Sex Research 36: 258–72.&lt;/ref&gt; Affirmative consent may still be limited since the underlying, individual circumstances surrounding the consent cannot always be acknowledged in the "yes means yes", or in the "no means no", model.&lt;ref name=Roffee&gt;{{cite web|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057%2F9781137476159_5|title=Roffee James A., ‘When Yes Actually Means Yes: Confusing Messages and Criminalising Consent’ in Rape Justice: Beyond the Criminal Law eds. Powell A., Henry N., and Flynn A., Palgrave, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some individuals are unable to give consent. Children or [[Minor (law)|minors]] below a certain age, the [[Age of consent|age of sexual consent]] in that [[jurisdiction]], are deemed not able to give valid consent by law to sexual acts. Likewise, persons with [[Alzheimer's disease]] or similar disabilities may be unable to give [[Consent (criminal law)|legal consent]] to sexual relations even with their spouse.&lt;ref name=NYT42215&gt;{{cite news|author1=Pam Belluck|title=Iowa Man Found Not Guilty of Sexually Abusing Wife With Alzheimer’s|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/23/health/iowa-man-found-not-guilty-of-sexually-abusing-wife-with-alzheimers.html|accessdate=April 23, 2015|work=The New York Times|date=April 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within literature, definitions surrounding consent and how it should be communicated have been contradictory, limited or without consensus.&lt;ref name=Roffee/&gt;&lt;ref name=Beres/&gt; Roffee argued that legal definition needs to be universal, so as to avoid confusion in legal decisions. He also demonstrated how the moral notion of consent does not always align with the legal concept. For example, some adult siblings or other family members may voluntarily enter into a relationship, however the legal system still deems this as incestual, and therefore a crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1093/hrlr/ngu023|title= No Consensus on Incest? Criminalisation and Compatibility with the European Convention on Human Rights| volume=14 | journal=Human Rights Law Review|pages=541–572}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roffee argues that the use of particular language in the legislation regarding these familial sexual activities manipulates the reader to view it as immoral and criminal, even if all parties are consenting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0964663913502068?legid=spsls%3B23%2F1%2F113&amp;patientinform-links=yes|title= The Synthetic Necessary Truth Behind New Labour’s Criminalisation of Incest| doi=10.1177/0964663913502068 | volume=23|journal=Social &amp; Legal Studies|pages=113–130}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, some children under the legal age of consent may knowingly and willingly choose to be in a sexual relationship. However the law does not view this as legitimate. Whilst there is a necessity for an age of consent, it does not allow for varying levels of awareness and maturity. Here it can be seen how a moral and a legal understanding do not always align.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palgraveconnect.com/pc/doifinder/10.1057/9781137476159.0009|title=Roffee, James (2015).

Initiatives in sex education programs are working towards including and foregrounding topics of and discussions of sexual consent, in primary, high school and college Sex Ed curricula.  In the UK, the Personal Social Health and Economic Education Association (PSHEA) is working to produce and introduce Sex Ed lesson plans in British schools that include lessons on "consensual sexual relationships," "the meaning and importance of consent" as well as "[[rape myth]]s".&lt;ref name=UK&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rawlinson|first=Kevin|title='Plans for sexual consent lessons in schools 'do not go far enough''|date=9 March 2015}} Retrieved March 13, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In U.S., California-Berkeley University has implemented affirmative and continual consent in education and in the school’s policies.&lt;ref name=consentpolicy&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grinberg|first=E.|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/09/03/living/affirmative-consent-school-policy/|title=‘Enthusiastic yes in sex consent education’|date=29 September 2014}} Retrieved March 13, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In Canada, the Ontario government has introduced a revised Sex Ed curriculum to Toronto schools, including new discussions of sex and affirmative consent, healthy relationships and communication.&lt;ref name=CAN&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rushowy|first=Kristin|url=https://www.thestar.com/yourtoronto/education/2015/02/25/in-ontario-sex-ed-consent-the-hot-issue.html|title=‘In Ontario sex ed, consent the hot issue’|date=25 February 2015}} Retrieved March 10, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Many universities have instituted campaigns about consent. Creative campaigns with attention-grabbing slogans and images that market consent can be effective tools to raise awareness of campus sexual assault and related issues.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas KA, Sorenson SB, Joshi M. "Consent is good, joyous, sexy": A banner campaign to market consent to college students. Journal of American College Health. 2016; 64(8):639-650&lt;/ref&gt;

===Affirmative consent===
Affirmative consent (enthusiastic yes) is when both parties agree to sexual conduct, either through clear, verbal communication or nonverbal cues or gestures.&lt;ref name=Grinberg&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grinberg|first=E.|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/09/03/living/affirmative-consent-school-policy/|title=‘Enthusiastic yes in sex consent education’|date=29 September 2014}} Retrieved March 10, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; It involves communication and the active participation of people involved. This is the approach endorsed by colleges and universities in the U.S.,&lt;ref&gt;"...affirmative consent standards have been adopted at colleges across the nation, including every ivy league university except Harvard. "Affirmative consent: A primer"  Christine Emba ''Washington Post'' Oct 12 2015 https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/in-theory/wp/2015/10/12/affirmative-consent-a-primer/&lt;/ref&gt; which describe consent as an "affirmative, unambiguous, and conscious decision by each participant to engage in mutually agreed-upon sexual activity." According to Yoon-Hendricks, a staff writer for Sex, Etc., "Instead of saying 'no means no,' 'yes means yes' looks at sex as a positive thing." Ongoing consent is sought at all levels of sexual intimacy regardless of the parties' relationship, prior sexual history or current activity ("Grinding on the dance floor is not consent for further sexual activity," a university policy reads).&lt;ref name=Grinberg/&gt; By definition, affirmative consent cannot be given if a person is intoxicated, unconscious or asleep.

There are 3 pillars often included in the description of sexual consent, or "the way we let others know what we're up for, be it a good-night kiss or the moments leading up to sex."

They are:

# Knowing exactly what and how much I'm agreeing to
# Expressing my intent to participate
# Deciding freely and voluntarily to participate&lt;ref name=Grinberg/&gt;

To obtain affirmative consent, rather than waiting to say or for a partner to say "no", one gives and seeks an explicit "yes". This can come in the form of a smile, a nod or a verbal yes, as long as it's unambiguous, enthusiastic and ongoing. "There's varying language, but the language gets to the core of people having to communicate their affirmation to participate in sexual behavior," said Denice Labertew of the California Coalition Against Sexual Assault.&lt;ref name=Grinberg/&gt; "It requires a fundamental shift in how we think about sexual assault. It's requiring us to say women and men should be mutually agreeing and actively participating in sexual behavior."&lt;ref name=Grinberg/&gt;

[[Image:cremonadiagram.jpg|thumbnail|right|Cremona diagram for a plane truss]]

The '''Cremona diagram''', also known as the Cremona-[[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]] method, is a graphical method used in [[statics]] of [[truss]]es to determine the forces in members ([[graphic statics]]). The method was developed by the Italian mathematician [[Luigi Cremona]]. However, recognizable Cremona diagrams appeared as early as 1725, in [[Pierre Varignon]]'s posthumously published work, ''Nouvelle Méchanique ou Statique''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Funicular Shell Design: Geometric Approaches to Form Finding and Fabrication of Discrete Funicular Structures|last=Rippmann|first=Matthias|series=[[Habilitation]] thesis, Diss. ETH No. 23307|publisher=[[ETH Zurich]]|year=2016|doi=10.3929/ethz-a-010656780|pages=39–40}}. See also {{citation|last=Erickson|first=Jeff|url=https://plus.google.com/+JeffErickson/posts/6UyRPX7ShXV|title=Reciprocal force diagrams from ''Nouvelle Méchanique ou Statique'' by Pierre de Varignon (1725)|date=June 9, 2016}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Cremona method, first the external forces and reactions are drawn (to [[scale (ratio)|scale]]) forming a vertical line in the lower right side of the picture. This is the [[net force|sum]] of all the force [[Vector (geometric)|vector]]s and is equal to zero as there is [[mechanical equilibrium]].

Since the [[static equilibrium|equilibrium]] holds for the external forces on the entire truss construction, it also holds for the internal forces acting on each joint. For a joint to be ''at rest'' the sum of the forces on a joint must also be equal to zero. Starting at joint ''Aorda'', the internal forces can be found by drawing lines in the Cremona diagram representing the forces in the members 1 and 4, going clockwise; ''V&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;'' (going up) load at ''A'' (going down), force in member 1 (going down/left), member 4 (going up/right) and closing with ''V&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;''.  As the force in member 1 is towards the joint, the member is under compression, the force in member 4 is away from the joint so the member 4 is under tension. The length of the lines for members 1 and 4 in the diagram, multiplied with the chosen scale [[coefficient|factor]] is the [[Magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] of the force in members 1 and 4.

Now, in the same way the forces in members 2 and 6 can be found for joint ''C''; force in member 1 (going up/right), force in ''C'' going down, force in 2 (going down/left), force in 6 (going up/left) and closing with the force in member 1.

The same steps can be taken for joints ''D'', ''H'' and ''E'' resulting in the complete Cremona diagram where the internal forces in all members are known.

In a next phase the forces caused by [[wind]] must be considered. Wind will cause pressure on the upwind side of a [[roof]] (and truss) and suction on the downwind side. This will translate to asymmetrical loads  but the Cremona method is the same. Wind force may introduce larger forces in the individual truss members than the static vertical loads.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4037">'''Dominion Rules''' (DR) is a [[role-playing game system]] for historical and fantasy [[role-playing]]. DR is notable in the history of [[role-playing games]] for being one of the first RPGs to be released under an [[open source]] (or [[open gaming]]) licence, known as the [[Dominion Rules Licence]].&lt;ref&gt;John Munsch, "Making Sure An Open Source RPG Stays Available": {{cite web |url=http://www.johnmunsch.com/2006/09/making_sure_a_open_source_rpg.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-05-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625084400/http://www.johnmunsch.com/2006/09/making_sure_a_open_source_rpg.html |archivedate=2008-06-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Development of the game followed an open source model whereby contributors, known as the Dominion Games Development Team,&lt;ref&gt;See "The Dominion Games Interview" (November 2000) at http://www.guildcompanion.com/scrolls/2000/nov/dginterview.html&lt;/ref&gt; made improvements or additions to the game and published them on the internet (often through the Dominion Games web site) under the terms of the Dominion Rules Licence, thus explicitly encouraging the creation of new skills, spells, beasts and rules by its modular structure in an attempt to establish an equivalent to the Open Source Software model in RPG gaming.

== Game Mechanic==
DR is a skills-based [[role-playing game system]] based on the twelve-sided die (d12). The game mechanic is the same for almost all actions: players roll d12 trying to roll less than or equal to the applicable skill stat, as modified by any applicable bonuses or penalties. For example, a character seeking to strike an opponent with his weapon begins with his Strike stat, adds to it the Strike bonus applicable to his weapon, and subtracts from that any defensive penalties imposed by his opponent's defensive manoeuvres and armour. A roll of 12 always fails. In many cases, a roll of 12 has particularly negative results. 

DR is designed around three major skill types, namely combat skills, priestcraft skills and witchcraft skills. All characters have access to combat skills. Priest-style characters have access to priest-specific skills such as bless, consecrate, curse, defile, heal, smite, wrath, and work miracle. Magic-using characters may either cast pre-made spells or employ free-form magic, both of which are essentially another type of skill use.

== Game Setting==
The DR rules system is intended to be generic and does not describe the kind of world (or "campaign setting") to which they apply. The system can be used in a variety of RPG settings by excluding or modifying certain rules. For a historical setting, players simply disregard the priestcraft and witchcraft rules.

== Distribution==
Dominion Rules was one of the first RPGs to be released under an open source style (or open gaming style) licence, known as the [[Dominion Rules Licence]]. The current version of DR  is distributed under version 2.0 of the [[Dominion Rules Licence]]. 

The current version of DR is free to download from http://www.dominionrules.org. Copies of the previous versions can be found in various places on the internet.

== History ==
DR 1.0 appeared in 1999. It was revised and republished as version 2.0 in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;"Dominion Rules 2.0" (game review) at http://www.guildcompanion.com/scrolls/2001/dec/reviewdominionrules2.html&lt;/ref&gt; Both versions were distributed by [[Dominion Games]]. No retail, print versions of the game were published. DR 2.0 received some favourable reviews.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, "Review of Dominion Rules Digest 2.0": http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/9/9525.phtml&lt;/ref&gt;

Dominion Games and their web site disappeared around 2006. The creators of the Dominion Rules released version 3.0 in April 2008 from  http://www.dominionrules.org to favourable reviews.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, "Dominion Rules by MAB": http://thefreerpgblog.blogspot.com/2008/11/dominion-rules-by-mab.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Dropsonde delivery system.jpg|thumb|Dropsonde delivery system on a NOAA P-3 Hurricane Hunter.]]
A '''dropsonde''' is an expendable [[weather]] reconnaissance device created by the [[National Center for Atmospheric Research]] (NCAR), designed to be dropped from an [[aircraft]] at altitude over water to measure (and therefore track) storm conditions as the device falls to the surface. The sonde contains a [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] receiver, along with [[pressure]], [[temperature]], and [[humidity]] (PTH) [[sensor]]s to capture [[atmosphere|atmospheric]] profiles and [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] [[data]]. It typically relays these data to a computer in the aircraft by radio transmission.

== Usage ==
[[File:Dropsonde.png|thumb|upright=1.25|A diagram of an NCAR GPS Dropsonde]]
Since the early 1970s,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.eol.ucar.edu/content/sounding-groups/history&lt;/ref&gt; [[hurricane hunters]] have employed dropsondes while flying over the ocean to obtain meteorological data on the structure of [[Tropical cyclone|hurricanes]] deemed to be of possible concern to land locations in the northern Atlantic and northeastern Pacific oceans.  Dropsonde instruments are typically the only way to measure the wind and pressure near the sea surface within the core of such cyclones, allowing meteorologists to reliably establish the storm's intensity and size.  The data obtained is typically fed into supercomputers for [[numerical weather prediction]], enabling forecasters to better track and predict what will happen to the hurricane.  During a typical hurricane season, the [[53d Weather Reconnaissance Squadron]] Hurricane Hunters deploys 1000 to 1500 sondes on training and storm missions.

Aircraft reconnaissance missions are also sometimes requested to investigate the broader atmospheric structure over the ocean when cyclones may pose a significant threat to the United States.  These interests include not only potential hurricanes, but also possible snow events (like [[nor'easters]]) or significant [[tornado outbreak]]s.  The dropsondes are used to supplement the large gaps over oceans within the global network of [[Radiosonde#Routine radiosonde launches|daily radiosonde launches]].  Typically satellite data provides an estimate of conditions in such areas, but the increased precision of sondes can improve forecasts, particularly of the storm path.

Dropsondes may also be employed during meteorological research projects.

== Device and Launch Details ==

The sonde is a lightweight system designed to be operated by one person and is launched through a chute installed in the measuring aircraft.  The device's descent is slowed and stabilized by a small square-cone [[Parachute#Round|parachute]], allowing for more readings to be taken before it reaches the ocean surface.  The parachute is designed to immediately deploy after release so as to reduce or eliminate any [[pendulum]] effect, and the device typically drops for three to five minutes.  The sonde has a casing of stiff cardboard to protect electronics and form a more stable aerodynamic profile.

To obtain data in a tropical cyclone, an aircraft (in the US, operated either by [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]] or the [[U.S. Air Force]]) flies into the system. A series of dropsondes are typically released as the plane passes through the storm, typically launched with greatest frequency near the center of the storm, including into the [[eye (cyclone)|eyewall]] and [[eye (cyclone)|eye]] (center), if one exists.  Most drops are performed at a flight level of around 10,000 feet (approx. 3,000 meters).

The dropsonde sends back coded data, which includes:
# The date and time of the drop. Time is always in [[UTC]].
# Location of the drop, indicated by the [[latitude]], [[longitude]], and [[Marsden square]].
# The height, temperature, [[dewpoint depression]], [[wind speed]], and [[wind direction]] recorded at any standard isobaric surfaces encountered as the dropsonde descends, which are from the set of: 1000, 925, 850, 700, 500, 400, 300, 250 [[Pascal (unit)#Hectopascal and millibar units|hectopascals]] (hPa), and at the sea surface.
# The temperature and dewpoint depression at all other atmospheric pressure deemed significant due to important changes or values in the atmospheric conditions found
# Air pressure, temperature, dewpoint depression, wind speed and wind direction of the [[tropopause]].

Also included in the report is information on the aircraft, the mission, the dropsonde itself, and other remarks.

==Driftsondes==
[[File:Dropsonde U.S. Air Force.jpeg|thumb|Dropsonde (source [[US Air Force]])]]
A driftsonde is a high altitude, durable [[weather balloon]] holding a transmitter and a bank (35 in the first models) of miniature dropsonde capsules which can then be dropped at automatic intervals or remotely.  The water-bottle-sized transmitters in the dropsondes have enough power to send information to the balloon during their parachute-controlled fall. The balloon carries a larger transmitter powerful enough to relay readings to a satellite.  The single-use sensor packages cost US$300 to $400 each.&lt;ref name="SciDay"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/videos/2007/0405-balloons_track_storms_and_save_lives.htm | title=Balloons Track Storms And Save Lives: Atmospheric Scientists And Meteorologists Use Driftsondes For Hurricane Forecasts | publisher=Science Daily | date=April 1, 2007 | accessdate=2013-05-24 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514132957/https://www.sciencedaily.com/videos/2007/0405-balloons_track_storms_and_save_lives.htm | archivedate=May 14, 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After being introduced in April 2007, around a thousand a year are expected to be used to track winds in hurricane breeding grounds off of West Africa, which are outside the operating region of Hurricane Hunter planes.&lt;ref name="SciDay"/&gt;

His crimes, committed around his hometown of [[Plainfield, Wisconsin]], gathered widespread notoriety after authorities discovered that Gein had [[Exhumation|exhumed]] corpses from local graveyards and fashioned trophies and keepsakes from their bones and skin. Gein confessed to killing two women – tavern owner Mary Hogan in 1954, and a Plainfield hardware store owner, Bernice Worden, in 1957. Gein was initially found unfit to stand trial and confined to a mental health facility. In 1968, Gein was found guilty but legally insane of the murder of Worden,&lt;ref name="guilty"/&gt; and was remanded to a psychiatric institution. He died at [[Mendota Mental Health Institute]] of cancer-induced liver and respiratory failure at age 77 on July 26, 1984. He is buried next to his family in the Plainfield Cemetery, in a now-unmarked grave.

==Early life==
Ed Gein was born in [[La Crosse County, Wisconsin]], on August 27, 1906,&lt;ref name="birthrecord"/&gt; the second of two boys of George Philip Gein (1873–1940&lt;ref name="Schechter2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Harold Schechter|title=Deviant|year=2010|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|isbn=978-1-4391-0697-6|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and Augusta Wilhelmine (née Lehrke) Gein (1878–1945).{{sfn|Schechter|1989|p=59}} Gein had an older brother, Henry George Gein (1901–1944).{{sfn|Schechter|1989|p=54}} Augusta despised her husband, an [[alcoholic]] who was unable to keep a job; he had worked at various times as a carpenter, [[tanning (leather)|tanner]], and insurance salesman. George owned a local grocery shop for a few years, but sold the business, and the family left the city to live in isolation on a 155-acre farm in the [[Plainfield (town), Wisconsin|town of Plainfield]] in [[Waushara County, Wisconsin]],&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historicmapworks.com/Map/US/58945/Plainfield+Township/Waushara+County+1924/Wisconsin/|title=Plainfield Township, Atlas: Waushara County 1924, Wisconsin Historical Map|last=LLC.|first=Historic Map Works|website=www.historicmapworks.com|access-date=March 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which became the Gein family's permanent residence.&lt;ref name="biography"&gt;Flaster, Alex. (producer) ''Biography: Ed Gain''. 2004. ''Biography''. Los Angeles, California: A&amp;E Television Networks.&lt;/ref&gt;

Augusta took advantage of the farm's isolation by turning away outsiders who could have influenced her sons.&lt;ref name="biography"/&gt; Edward left the farm only to attend school. Outside of school, he spent most of his time doing chores on the farm. Augusta was fervently religious, and nominally [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]]. She preached to her boys about the innate immorality of the world, the evil of drinking, and her belief that all women (except herself) were naturally prostitutes and instruments of the [[devil]]. She reserved time every afternoon to read to them from the Bible, usually selecting graphic verses from the [[Old Testament]] concerning death, murder, and [[divine retribution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Anne|last1=Williams|first2=Vivian|last2=Head|first3=Amy|last3=Williams|title=Fiendish Killers: Perpetrators Of The Worst Possible Evil|publisher=Futura Publishing|location=London, England|date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edward was shy, and classmates and teachers remembered him as having strange mannerisms, such as seemingly random laughter, as if he were laughing at his own personal jokes. To make matters worse, his mother punished him whenever he tried to make friends. Despite his poor social development, he did fairly well in school, particularly in reading.&lt;ref name="biography"/&gt;

===Deaths in immediate family===
On April 1, 1940, Ed's father George died of heart failure caused by his alcoholism; he was 66 years old. Henry and Ed began doing odd jobs around town to help cover living expenses. The brothers were generally considered reliable and honest by residents of the community. While both worked as handymen, Ed also frequently babysat for neighbors. He enjoyed babysitting, seeming to relate more easily to children than adults.  Henry began dating a divorced, single mother of two and planned on moving in with her; Henry worried about his brother's attachment to their mother and often spoke ill of her around Ed, who responded with shock and hurt.&lt;ref name="biography"/&gt;

On May 16, 1944, Henry and Ed were burning away marsh vegetation on the property;{{sfn|Gollmar|1981|p=85}} the fire got out of control, drawing the attention of the local fire department. By the end of the day&amp;nbsp;– the fire having been extinguished and the firefighters gone&amp;nbsp;– Ed reported his brother missing. With lanterns and flashlights, a search party searched for Henry, whose dead body was found lying face down.&lt;ref name="Wisconsin Rapids Page 1"&gt;"Rites Today For Man Who Died in Roche-a-Cri Fire". ''Wisconsin Rapids Daily Tribune'', Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin, May 19, 1944, p. 1, col. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Apparently, he had been dead for some time, and it appeared that the cause of death was heart failure, since he had not been burned or injured otherwise.&lt;ref name="Wisconsin Rapids Page 1"/&gt; It was later reported, in [[Harold Schechter]]'s biography of Gein, ''Deviant'', that Henry had bruises on his head.&lt;ref name="henry"&gt;{{cite web |last=Bell |first=Rachael |author2=Marilyn Bardsley |url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/notorious/gein/2b.html |title=Henry |accessdate=2008-11-23 |publisher=[[Crime Library]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203124822/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/notorious/gein/2b.html |archivedate=December 3, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}{{better source|date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Schechter|1989|p=30}}{{sfn|Schechter|1989|p=31}} The police dismissed the possibility of foul play and the county [[coroner]] later officially listed [[asphyxia]]tion as the cause of death.&lt;ref name="biography"/&gt;{{sfn|Schechter|1989|p=30}}{{sfn|Schechter|1989|p=31}} The authorities accepted the accident theory, but no official investigation was conducted  and an autopsy was not performed.{{sfn|Gollmar|1981|p=86}} Some suspected that Ed Gein killed his brother. Questioning Gein about the death of Bernice Worden in 1957, state investigator Joe Wilimovsky brought up questions about Henry's death.{{sfn|Gollmar|1981|p=85}} George W. Arndt, who studied the case, wrote that, in retrospect, it was "possible and likely" that Henry's death was "the "[[Cain and Abel]]" aspect of this case".{{sfn|Gollmar|1981|p=8}}{{sfn|Gollmar|1981|p=9}}

Gein and his mother were now alone. Augusta had a paralyzing stroke shortly after Henry's death, and Gein devoted himself to taking care of her. Sometime in 1945, Gein later recounted, he and his mother visited a man named Smith, who lived nearby, to purchase straw. According to Gein, Augusta witnessed Smith beating a dog. A woman inside the Smith home came outside and yelled for him to stop but Smith beat the dog to death. Augusta was extremely upset by this scene, however, what bothered her did not appear to be the brutality toward the dog but rather the presence of the woman. Augusta told Ed that the woman was not married to Smith so had no business being there. "Smith's harlot", Augusta angrily called her. She had a second stroke soon after, and her health deteriorated rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Denise|last=Noe|url=http://mensnewsdaily.com/2007/04/27/augusta-gein-the-woman-who-drove-a-man-psycho/ |title=Augusta Gein, the woman who drove a man Psycho |work=Men's News Daily|date=April 27, 2007 |accessdate=September 25, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6IviPHaro?url=http://mensnewsdaily.com/2007/04/27/augusta-gein-the-woman-who-drove-a-man-psycho/ |archivedate=August 17, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; She died on December 29, 1945, at the age of 67. Ed was devastated by her death; in the words of author Harold Schechter, he had "lost his only friend and one true love. And he was absolutely alone in the world."{{sfn|Schechter|1989|p=30}}{{sfn|Schechter|1989|p=31}}

==Work==
Gein held on to the farm and earned money from odd jobs. He boarded up rooms used by his mother, including the upstairs, downstairs parlor, and living room, leaving them untouched; while the rest of the house became increasingly squalid, these rooms remained pristine. Gein lived thereafter in a small room next to the kitchen. Around this time, he became interested in reading death-cult magazines and adventure stories, particularly those involving [[cannibals]] or [[Nazi]] atrocities.&lt;ref name="biography"/&gt;

Gein was a handyman and received a farm subsidy from the federal government starting in 1951. He occasionally worked for the local municipal road crew and crop-threshing crews in the area. Sometime between 1946 and 1956, he also sold an 80-acre parcel of land that his brother Henry had owned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mark |first1=Timothy |title=The "Ed Gein" Story |date=2015 |publisher=Lulu|isbn=9781312995697 |page=22 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6m2pCQAAQBAJ&amp;q=80+acre#v=snippet&amp;q=80%20acre|quote=Click on &gt;&gt; to expand page}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crimes==
On the morning of November 16, 1957, Plainfield hardware store owner Bernice Worden disappeared. A Plainfield resident reported that the hardware store's truck had been driven out from the rear of the building around 9:30 am. The hardware store was closed the entire day; some area residents believed this was because of deer hunting season.  Bernice Worden's son, Deputy Sheriff Frank Worden, entered the store around 5:00 pm to find the store's cash register open and blood stains on the floor.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/183986412|title=Widow, 58, Found Slain in Wisconsin|last=|first=|date=November 17, 1957|work=Star Tribune|access-date=March 3, 2017|page=1|language=en|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Frank Worden told investigators that Ed Gein had been in the store the evening before his mother's disappearance, and that he would return the next morning for a gallon of antifreeze.

When questioned, Gein told investigators that between 1947 and 1952,{{sfn|Schechter|1989|p=97}} he made as many as 40 nocturnal visits to three local graveyards to exhume recently buried bodies while he was in a "daze-like" state. On about 30 of those visits, he said he came out of the daze while in the cemetery, left the grave in good order, and returned home empty-handed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gein Also Admits He Killed Mary Hogan; Results of Lie Tests Announced|date=November 20, 1957 |publisher=''Stevens Point Daily Journal''|page=13, col. 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other occasions, he dug up the graves of recently buried middle-aged women he thought resembled his mother&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Case File – Ed Gein |url=http://www.fortunecity.com/roswell/streiber/273/gein_cf.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016184447/http://www.fortunecity.com/roswell/streiber/273/gein_cf.htm |archivedate=October 16, 2011 |accessdate=April 11, 2014}}{{better source|date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://maamodt.asp.radford.edu/Psyc%20405/serial%20killers/Gein,%20Ed.pdf|title=Edward Theodore Gein, American Psycho|author=Radford University students |publisher=Department of Psychology, Radford University|website=radford.edu|quote=Beginning in 1947 - He saw a newspaper article of a woman who had been buried that day.

Gein admitted to stealing from nine graves from local cemeteries &lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hannemanarchive.com/tag/augusta-gein/|title=Augusta Gein, The Hanneman Archive|website=hannemanarchive.com|language=en|access-date=December 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=897&amp;dat=19571126&amp;id=buUKAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=iE8DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2954,2739537 | title=Prescott Evening Courier - Google News Archive Search | accessdate=October 16, 2017 | website=news.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and led investigators to their locations. Allan Wilimovsky of the state crime laboratory participated in opening three test graves identified by Gein. The caskets were inside wooden boxes; the top boards ran crossways (not lengthwise). The tops of the boxes were about 2 feet (60&amp;nbsp;cm) below the surface in sandy soil. Gein had robbed the graves soon after the funerals while the graves were not completed. The test graves were exhumed because authorities were uncertain as to whether the slight Gein was capable of single-handedly digging up a grave during a single evening; they were found as Gein described: two of the exhumed graves were found empty (one had a crowbar in place of the body). One casket was empty; one casket Gein had failed to open when he lost his pry bar; and most of the body was gone from the third grave, but Gein had returned rings and some body parts.{{sfn|Gollmar|1981|p=48}}{{sfn|Gollmar|1981|p=49}}{{sfn|Gollmar|1981|p=50}} thus apparently corroborating Gein's confession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Empty Coffins Discovered in Graves at Plainfield; Appears To Back Up Gein's Story|date=November 25, 1957|publisher=''Stevens Point Daily Journal''|page=1, cols. 7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=DA Convinced Gein Actually Raided Graves|date=November 26, 1957|publisher=''Stevens Point Daily Journal''|page=1, col. 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=pv&amp;GRid=5965868&amp;PIpi=95172936|title=The Milwaukee Sentinel, November 26, 1957|last=|first=|date=|newspaper=The Milwaukee Sentinel, November 26, 1957|accessdate=|work=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Soon after his mother's death, Gein began to create a "woman suit" so that "...he could become his mother—to literally crawl into her skin".&lt;ref name="necrophile"/&gt; Gein denied having sex with the bodies he exhumed, explaining: "They smelled too bad."&lt;ref name="psycho"&gt;{{cite web |last=Bell |first=Rachael |first2=Marilyn |last2=Bardsley |url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/notorious/gein/weird_3.html |title=Seriously weird |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130062755/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/notorious/gein/weird_3.html |archive-date=January 30, 2009 |work=[[Tru TV]] |access-date=July 24, 2018 |publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; During state crime laboratory interrogation, Gein also admitted to the shooting death of Mary Hogan, a tavern owner missing since 1954 whose head was found in his house, but he later denied memory of details of her death.{{sfn|Gollmar|1981}}

A 16-year-old youth, whose parents were friends of Gein and who attended ball games and movies with him, reported that Gein kept shrunken heads in his house, which Gein had described as relics from the [[Philippines]], sent by a cousin who had served on the islands during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Youth Tells of Seeing Gein's Heads|date=November 20, 1957|publisher=''Stevens Point Daily Journal''|page=1, col. 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon investigation by the police, these were determined to be human facial skins, carefully peeled from corpses and used by Gein as masks.{{sfn|Schechter|1989|p=128}}

Gein was also considered a suspect in several other unsolved cases in Wisconsin, including the 1953 disappearance of [[Evelyn Hartley]], a [[La Crosse, Wisconsin|La Crosse]] babysitter.{{sfn|Schechter|1989|p=95}}{{sfn|Schechter|1989|p=100}}{{sfn|Schechter|1989|p=105}}{{sfn|Schechter|1989|p=177}}

During questioning, [[Waushara County, Wisconsin|Waushara County]] sheriff Art Schley reportedly assaulted Gein by banging his head and face into a brick wall. As a result, Gein's initial confession was ruled inadmissible.{{sfn|Schechter|1989|p=30}}{{sfn|Schechter|1989|p=31}}{{sfn|Gollmar|1981|p=31}}{{sfn|Gollmar|1981|p=32}}{{sfn|Gollmar|1981|p=33}}{{sfn|Gollmar|1981|p=34}} Schley died of heart failure at age 43 in 1968, before Gein's trial.{{sfn|Gollmar|1981|p=34}} Many who knew Schley said he was [[psychological trauma|traumatized]] by the horror of Gein's crimes, and this, along with the fear of having to testify (especially about assaulting Gein), caused his death. One of his friends said: "He was a victim of Ed Gein as surely as if he had butchered him."{{sfn|Schechter|1989|p=30}}{{sfn|Schechter|1989|p=31}}

===Trial===
On November 21, 1957, Gein was [[arraignment|arraigned]] on one count of [[first degree murder]] in Waushara County Court, where he pleaded [[not guilty by reason of insanity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gein Pleads Innocent By Reason of Insanity|date=November 21, 1957|publisher=Stevens Point Daily Journal|page=1, cols. 7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gein was diagnosed with [[schizophrenia]] and found mentally incompetent, thus unfit for trial. He was sent to the Central State Hospital for the Criminally Insane (now the [[Dodge Correctional Institution]]), a maximum-security facility in [[Waupun, Wisconsin]], and later transferred to the [[Mendota State Hospital]] in [[Madison, Wisconsin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Moira|last=Martindale|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XgaTQ7eJOFMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;cad=0#v=onepage |title=Cannibal Killers  |place=New York City|publisher=St. Martin's |year=1993 |accessdate=November 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, doctors determined Gein was "mentally able to confer with counsel and participate in his defense".{{sfn|Gollmar|1981|p=95}} The trial began on November 7, 1968&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ed Gein Will Be in Court|newspaper=Oshkosh Daily Northwestern|location=Oshkosh, Wisconsin|date=November 6, 1968|page=4, col. 6.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Gein Trial Under Way", ''Oshkosh Daily Northwestern'', November 7, 1968, p. 1, col. 5.

A psychiatrist testified that Gein had told him that he did not know whether the killing of Bernice Worden was intentional or accidental. Gein had told him that while he examined a gun in Worden's store, the gun went off, killing Worden.&lt;ref&gt;"Psychiatrist Tells Gein Account of Worden Death", ''Oshkosh Daily Northwestern'', November 12, 1968, p. 1, col. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Gein testified that after trying to load a bullet into the rifle, it discharged. He said he had not aimed the rifle at Worden, and did not remember anything else that happened that morning.&lt;ref&gt;"Gein Takes Stand, Remembers Little", ''The Daily Telegram'', Eau Claire, Wisconsin, November 13, 1968, p. 1, col. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the request of the defense, Gein's trial was held without a jury,{{sfn|Schechter|1989|p=227}} with Judge Robert H. Gollmar presiding. Gein was found guilty by Gollmar on November 14.&lt;ref name="guilty"/&gt; A second trial dealt with Gein's sanity;&lt;ref name="guilty"/&gt; after testimony by doctors for the prosecution and defense, Gollmar ruled Gein "not guilty by reason of insanity" and ordered him committed to Central State Hospital for the Criminally Insane.{{sfn|Gollmar|1981|p=172}} Gein spent the rest of his life in a mental hospital.&lt;ref name="guilty"&gt;{{cite news|title=Ed Gein Found Guilty of 1957 Murder in Plainfield|quote=Ed Gein, the handyman whose home became known as a "house of horrors" 11 years ago, was found guilty today of first degree murder.|newspaper=The Capital Times |place=Madison, Wisconsin |date=November 14, 1958 |page=2, col. 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wisconsin Killer Gein Ruled Guilty, Insane |quote=Ed Gein, 62, the recluse who horrified the nation in 1957 when the remains of 11 bodies were found on his farm, was ruled today to have been insane when he killed a Plainfield, Wis., woman. |publisher=Chicago Tribune |date=November 15, 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judge Gollmar wrote, "Due to prohibitive costs, Gein was tried for only one murder—that of Mrs. Worden.

===Aftermath===
Gein's house and property were scheduled to be auctioned March 30, 1958, amid rumors the house was to become a tourist attraction. On March 27, the house was destroyed by fire. Arson was suspected, but the cause was never officially determined.&lt;ref&gt;Gollmar, ''Edward Gein'', Pinnacle Books, 3rd ed., 1989, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; When Gein learned of the incident while in detention, he shrugged and said, "Just as well."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3X5WwY-hvKQC&amp;pg=PT99 |date=October 15, 1995 |page=90 |publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]] |title=Ed Gein–Psycho! |last=Woods |first=Paul Anthony |last2=Morris |first2=Errol |author2-link=Errol Morris |isbn=9780312130572}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gein's car, which he used to haul the bodies of his victims, was sold at public auction for $760 to carnival [[sideshow]] operator [[Bunny Gibbons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hintz|first=Martin |title=Got Murder?: Shocking True Stories of Wisconsins Notorious Killers|publisher=Big Earth Publishing |year=2007 |page=62 |isbn=1-931599-96-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gibbons later charged carnival goers 25¢ admission to see it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Reavill|first=Gil Reavill|title=Aftermath, Inc.: Cleaning Up After CSI Goes Home|publisher=Gotham|year=2007|page=228|isbn=1-59240-296-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
[[File:Ed Gein Headstone.jpg|thumb|left|190px|Ed Gein's vandalized grave marker as it appeared in 1999 before thieves stole it]]
Gein died at the Mendota Mental Health Institute due to [[respiratory failure]] secondary to [[lung cancer]] on July 26, 1984, at the age of 77.{{sfn|Schechter|1989|p=30}}{{sfn|Schechter|1989|p=31}} Over the years, souvenir seekers chipped pieces from his [[gravestone]] at the Plainfield Cemetery, until the stone itself was stolen in 2000. It was recovered in June 2001, near [[Seattle]], and was placed in storage at the Waushara County Sheriff's Department. The gravesite itself is now unmarked, but not unknown; Gein is interred between his parents and brother in the cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Michael |last=Bie |title=It Happened in Wisconsin |publisher=TwoDot |location=[[Guilford, Connecticut]] |year=2007 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=AfsoOl6qmiwC&amp;pg=PA97 97] |isbn=0-7627-4153-8 |oclc=76820808}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
&lt;!---
Please refrain from adding minor listings of instances where Gein is mentioned, only in passing, in songs, movies or other media. ''Impact on Pop Culture'' sections are not intended to be exhaustive lists of minor data. If you have an item or items you think may be appropriate (notable, historically important, encyclopedic), please, bring it up on the talk page first. Any additions not previously discussed will likely be removed. It is preferred that we not list when Bart Simpson says his name or yet another band writes a song, especially if the mention has little regard for Gein's factual history. Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

I would like to add that when "popular culture" headings become bloated with trivial references, they often get entirely deleted on Wikipedia. Before adding a book, movie, song, anime, etc influenced by Gein, ask: Is this as notable as Psycho or does it belong only as a note in the article on the influenced item with a link from there to Ed Gein. We need to be careful and encyclopedic or we will lose this. 
---&gt;
The story of Ed Gein has had a lasting effect on [[American culture|American]] popular culture as evidenced by its numerous appearances in film, music, and literature. The tale first came to widespread public attention in the fictionalized version presented by [[Robert Bloch]] in his 1959 suspense novel ''[[Psycho (novel)|Psycho]]''. In addition to [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s 1960 film of Bloch's novel, ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'',&lt;ref name="PM"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.popmatters.com/column/167248-no-texas-no-chainsaw-no-massacre-the-true-links-in-the-chain/ | title=No Texas, No Chainsaw, No Massacre: The True Links in the Chain | work=[[PopMatters]] | date=February 4, 2013 | author=Maçek III, J.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gein's story was loosely adapted into a number of films, including ''[[Deranged (1974 film)|Deranged]]'' (1974),&lt;ref name=PM/&gt; ''[[In the Light of the Moon]]'' (2000) (released in the United States and Australia as ''Ed Gein'' (2001)), ''[[Ed Gein: The Butcher of Plainfield]]'' (2007), ''[[Hitchcock (film)|Hitchcock]]'' (2012), and the [[Rob Zombie]] films ''[[House of 1000 Corpses]]'' and its sequel, ''[[The Devil's Rejects]]''. Gein served as the inspiration for a myriad of fictional serial killers across different mediums, most notably the likes of [[Norman Bates]] (''[[Psycho (novel)|Psycho]]''), [[Leatherface]] (''[[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (franchise)|The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]''),&lt;ref name=PM/&gt; [[Buffalo Bill (character)|Buffalo Bill]] (''[[The Silence of the Lambs (novel)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'')&lt;ref name=PM/&gt; and the character Dr. Oliver Thredson from the TV series ''[[American Horror Story: Asylum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Glamour (magazine)|Glamour]]|title=All the Real-Life Scary Stories Told on American Horror Story|author=Eidell, Lynsey|date=October 7, 2015|url=http://www.glamour.com/story/all-of-the-real-life-scary-sto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American filmmaker [[Errol Morris]] and German filmmaker [[Werner Herzog]] attempted unsuccessfully to collaborate on a [[Errol Morris#Biography|film project]] about Gein from 1975 to 1976. Morris interviewed Gein several times and ended up spending almost a year in Plainfield interviewing dozens of locals. The pair planned secretly to exhume Gein's mother from her grave to test a theory but never followed through on the scheme and eventually ended their collaboration. The aborted project was described in a 1989 ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' profile of Morris.&lt;ref name="singer1"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Predilections|last=Singer|first=Mark|journal=[[The New Yorker]]|date=February 2, 1989|url=http://www.errolmorris.com/content/profile/singer_predilections.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time, the news reports of Gein's crimes spawned a subgenre of "[[black humor]]".&lt;ref&gt;George W. Arndt, "Appendix A: Gein Humor" in Robert H. Gollmar, ''Edward Gein'' (Pinnacle Books, Windsor Publishing, 3rd ed., 1989) excerpted from Arndt's original "Horror, Humor and Human Nature" also published abridged as "Community Reactions to a Horrifying event" by Menninger School of Psychiatry; both versions reprinted in several psychology textbooks.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1950s, Gein has frequently been exploited by [[transgressive art]] or "[[shock rock]]", often without association with his life or crimes beyond the shock value of his name. Examples of this include the song titled "[[Dead Skin Mask]]" (1990) from the [[Slayer]] album ''[[Seasons in the Abyss]]'', "[[Nothing to Gein]]" (2001) from [[Mudvayne]]'s album ''[[L.D. 50 (album)|L.D. 50]]'', and "Ed Gein" (1992) from [[The Ziggens]]' album ''Rusty Never Sleeps''.&lt;ref&gt;The Slayer song "[[Dead Skin Mask]]" features a young girl pleading with Gein to release her; Gein never held a live captive and his victims were middle-aged women.&lt;/ref&gt; There was the band [[Ed Gein (band)|Ed Gein]] called after the murderer.  Ed Gein's atrocities were also satirized in [[Blind Melon]]'s "Skinned" from the 1995 album ''[[Soup (Blind Melon album)|Soup]]''.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}
&lt;!---
Again, DO NOT add a trivia section or trivial listings of instances where Gein is mentioned in songs, movies or other arts and entertainment media. This is covered sufficiently in this section and is not intended to be an exhaustive list. If you have items you think may be encyclopedic, bring it up on the talk page. Any additions not previously discussed WILL BE REMOVED. Thank you.

[[File:Woman collapses in the East Village of New York.jpg|thumb|Emergency Medical Technician  treating a woman who has collapsed in the street in New York. Dangers to life and health are serious enough that emergency response systems are considered vital.]]
An '''emergency''' is a situation that poses an immediate risk to [[health]], [[life]], [[property]], or [[Natural environment|environment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UK Government Advice on Definition of an Emergency |url=http://www.ukresilience.info/upload/assets/www.ukresilience.info/15mayshortguide.pdf |accessdate=2007-05-30 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070606230917/http://www.ukresilience.info/upload/assets/www.ukresilience.info/15mayshortguide.pdf |archivedate=2007-06-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most emergencies require urgent intervention to prevent a worsening of the situation, although in some situations, mitigation may not be possible and agencies may only be able to offer palliative care for the aftermath.

While some emergencies are self-evident (such as a [[natural disaster]] that threatens many lives), many smaller incidents require that an observer (or affected party) decide whether it qualifies as an emergency.
The precise definition of an emergency, the agencies involved and the procedures used, vary by jurisdiction, and this is usually set by the [[government]], whose agencies ([[emergency service]]s) are responsible for emergency planning and management.

==Defining an emergency==
An incident, to be an emergency, conforms to one or more of the following: if it:
* Poses an immediate threat to [[life]], [[health]], [[property]], or environment
* Has already caused loss of life, health detriments, property damage, or environmental damage
* has a high [[probability]] of escalating to cause immediate danger to life, health, property, or environment{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}

In the United States, most states mandate that a notice be printed in each telephone book that requires that someone must relinquish use of a phone line, if a person requests the use of a telephone line (such as a [[party line (telephony)|party line]]) to report an emergency.   State statutes typically define an ''emergency'' as, "...a condition where life, health, or property is in jeopardy, and the prompt summoning of aid is essential."&lt;ref&gt;Some examples of state statutes defining ''emergency'' for this purpose: California Penal Code, Sec. 384&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst most emergency services agree on protecting [[human]] health, life and property, the environmental impacts are not considered sufficiently important by some agencies{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}.  This also extends to areas such as [[animal welfare]], where some emergency organizations cover this element through the "property" definition, where animals owned by a person are threatened (although this does not cover wild animals).   This means that some agencies do not mount an "emergency" response where it endangers wild animals or environment{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}, though others respond to such incidents (such as oil spills at sea that threaten marine life).  The attitude of the agencies involved is likely to reflect the predominant opinion of the government of the area.

==Types of emergency==
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2014}}

===Dangers to life===
Many emergencies cause an immediate danger to the life of people involved.  This can range from emergencies affecting a single person, such as the entire range of [[Medical emergency|medical emergencies]] including [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]]s, [[stroke]]s, [[cardiac arrest]] and [[Physical trauma|trauma]], to incidents that affect large numbers of people such as [[natural disaster]]s including [[tornado]]es, [[hurricane]]s, [[flood]]s, [[earthquake]]s, [[mudslide]]s and outbreaks of diseases such as [[cholera]], [[Ebola virus disease|Ebola]], and [[malaria]].

Most agencies consider these the highest priority emergency, which follows the general school of thought that nothing is more important than human life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukresilience.info/upload/assets/www.ukresilience.info/emergresponse.pdf |title=UK Government document stating that life-saving activity is the highest priority in an emergency |accessdate=2007-05-30 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070606232027/http://www.ukresilience.info/upload/assets/www.ukresilience.info/emergresponse.pdf |archivedate=2007-06-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dangers to health===
Some emergencies are not necessarily immediately threatening to life, but might have serious implications for the continued health and well-being of a person or persons (though a health emergency can subsequently escalate to life-threatening).

The causes of a health emergency are often very similar to the causes of an emergency threatening to life, which includes medical emergencies and natural disasters, although the ''range'' of incidents that can be categorized here is far greater than those that cause a danger to life (such as broken limbs, which do not usually cause death, but immediate intervention is required if the person is to recover properly). Many life emergencies, such as cardiac arrest, are also health emergencies.

===Dangers to the environment===

Some emergencies do not immediately endanger life, health or property, but do affect the natural environment and creatures living within it.  Not all agencies consider this a genuine emergency, but it can have far-reaching effects on animals and the long term condition of the land.  Examples would include [[forest fire]]s and marine [[oil spill]]s.

==Systems of classifying emergencies==
Agencies across the world have different systems for classifying incidents, but all of them serve to help them allocate finite resource, by prioritising between different emergencies.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}

The first stage of any classification is likely to define whether the incident qualifies as an emergency, and consequently if it warrants an emergency response. Some agencies may still respond to non-emergency calls, depending on their remit and availability of resource.  An example of this would be a fire department responding to help retrieve a cat from a tree, where no life, health or property is immediately at risk.

Following this, many agencies assign a sub-classification to the emergency, prioritising incidents that have the most potential for risk to life, health or property (in that order).  For instance, many ambulance services use a system called the [[Advanced Medical Priority Dispatch System]] (AMPDS) or a similar solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tampagov.net/dept_fire/rescue_division/general_info/advanced_medical_priority_dispatch.asp |title=Tampa Fire Department EMS dispatch details |accessdate=2007-05-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060505220614/http://www.tampagov.net/dept_fire/rescue_division/general_info/advanced_medical_priority_dispatch.asp |archivedate=May 5, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.londonambulance.nhs.uk/helpweoffer/help1.html |title=London Ambulance Service details of AMPDS use |accessdate=2007-05-30 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070130163345/http://www.londonambulance.nhs.uk/helpweoffer/help1.html |archivedate=2007-01-30 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The AMPDS categorises all calls to the ambulance service using it as  either 'A' category (immediately life-threatening), 'B' Category (immediately health threatening) or 'C' category (non-emergency call that still requires a response).  Some services have a fourth category, where they believe that no response is required after clinical questions are asked.

Another system for prioritizing medical calls is known as Emergency Medical Dispatch (EMD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.911dispatch.com/info/emd/index.html|title=EMD Resources|accessdate=2007-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://health.utah.gov/ems/stdseval/training/emd_curriculum_trainee.pdf |title=EMD Training Guide |publisher=Utah Bureau of Emergency Medical Services |date=January 2005 |accessdate=2007-07-07 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070925174249/http://health.utah.gov/ems/stdseval/training/emd_curriculum_trainee.pdf |archivedate=2007-09-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Jurisdictions that use EMD typically assign a code of "alpha" (low priority), "bravo" (medium priority), "charlie" (requiring [[paramedic|advanced life support]]), delta (high priority, requiring [[advanced life support]]) or "echo" (maximum possible priority, e.g., witnessed cardiac arrests) to each inbound request for service; these codes are then used to determine the appropriate level of response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dhss.delaware.gov/dhss/dph/ems/files/demsocreport2005.txt|title=DEMSOC Annual Report - 2005|publisher=Delaware Emergency Medical Services Oversight Council|year=2005|accessdate=2007-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emergencydispatch.org/JOURNAL/articles/UsingECHO.html |title=Using the ECHO Determinant |author=Brian Dale |accessdate=2007-07-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040904075414/http://www.emergencydispatch.org/JOURNAL/articles/UsingECHO.html |archivedate=September 4, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emergencydispatch.org/articles/themostofEMS.htm|title=EMD: Making the Most of EMS|author=Jeff J.

Other systems (especially as regards [[Emergency management|major incident]]s) use objective measures to direct resource.  Two such systems are [[CHALET|SAD CHALET]] and [[ETHANE]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patient.co.uk/showdoc/40001331|title=Patient Plus reference to CHALET and ETHANE systems|accessdate=2007-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are both mnemonics to help emergency services staff classify incidents, and direct resource.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leslp.gov.uk/firstoff.htm |title=London Emergency planning committee use of CHALET |accessdate=2007-05-30 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626114729/http://www.leslp.gov.uk/firstoff.htm |archivedate=2007-06-26 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each of these acronyms helps ascertain the number of casualties (usually including the number of dead and number of non-injured people involved), how the incident has occurred, and what emergency services are required.

==Agencies involved in dealing with emergencies==

{{main article|Emergency service}}

Most developed countries have a number of [[emergency service]]s operating within them, whose purpose is to provide assistance in dealing with any emergency.  They are often government operated, paid for from [[tax]] revenue as a public service, but in some cases, they may be private companies, responding to emergencies in return for payment, or they may be voluntary organisations, providing the assistance from funds raised from [[donation]]s.

Most developed countries operate three core emergency services{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}:

* '''[[Police]]''' – handle mainly [[crime]]-related emergencies.
* '''[[Fire department|Fire]]''' – handle [[fire]]-related emergencies and usually possess secondary rescue duties.
* '''[[Emergency Medical Service|Medical]]''' – handle [[Medicine|medical]]-related emergencies.

There may also be a number of specialized emergency services, which may be a part of one of the core agencies, or may be separate entities who assist the main agencies. This can include services, such as [[bomb disposal]], [[search and rescue]], and [[Dangerous goods|hazardous material]] operations.

The Military and the [[Amateur Radio Emergency Service]] (ARES) or [[Radio Amateur Civil Emergency Service]] (RACES) help in large emergencies such as a disaster or major civil unrest.

=== Summoning emergency services ===
{{main article|Emergency telephone number}}
Most countries have an [[emergency telephone number]], also known as the universal emergency number, which can be used to summon the emergency services to any incident.  This number varies from country to country (and in some cases by region within a country), but in most cases, they are in a short number format, such as [[9-1-1|911]] (United States and many parts of Canada),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nena.org/|title=US National Emergency Number Association|accessdate=2007-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[999 (emergency telephone number)|999]] (United Kingdom),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fire.org.uk/advice/999history.htm |title=History of the 999 System |accessdate=2007-05-30 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070528022735/http://www.fire.org.uk/advice/999history.htm |archivedate=2007-05-28 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.met.police.uk/999/index.htm |title=Metropolitan Police advice on using 999 |accessdate=2007-05-30 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609160248/http://www.met.police.uk/999/index.htm |archivedate=2007-06-09 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[1-1-2|112]] (Europe)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ofcom.org.uk/static/archive/Oftel/publications/ind_guidelines/emer1002.htm |title=UK government advice on the use of 112 alongside 999 |accessdate=2007-05-30 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403072801/http://www.ofcom.org.uk/static/archive/Oftel/publications/ind_guidelines/emer1002.htm |archivedate=2007-04-03 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ec&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/civil/pdfdocs/112surv-2001.pdf |title=European Commission document on the Implementation of the Single 112 emergency number |accessdate=2007-05-30 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614210603/http://ec.europa.eu/environment/civil/pdfdocs/112surv-2001.pdf |archivedate=2007-06-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[000]] (Australia).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://emergencycalls.aca.gov.au/ |title=Australian Government Advice on Emergency Calls |accessdate=2007-05-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070531230159/http://www.emergencycalls.aca.gov.au/ |archivedate=2007-05-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of mobile phones also dial the emergency services, even if the phone keyboard is locked, or if the phone has an expired or missing [[Subscriber Identity Module|SIM card]], although the provision of this service varies by country and network.&lt;ref name=ec/&gt;

=== Civil emergency services ===

In addition to those services provided specifically for emergencies, there may be a number of agencies who provide an emergency service as an incidental part of their normal 'day job' provision. This can include [[public utility]] workers, such as in provision of [[electricity]] or [[gas]], who may be required to respond quickly, as both utilities have a large potential to cause danger to life, health and property if there is an infrastructure failure&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalgrid.com/uk/Gas/Safety/Emergency|title=UK National Gas Emergency Number|accessdate=2007-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dti.gov.uk/files/file33246.pdf |title=UK Government Gas and Electricity National Emergency Plan |accessdate=2007-05-30 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610203937/http://www.dti.gov.uk/files/file33246.pdf |archivedate=2007-06-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Domestic emergency services===

Generally perceived as pay per use emergency services, domestic emergency services are small, medium or large businesses who tend to emergencies within the boundaries of licensing or capabilities. These tend to consist of emergencies where health or property is perceived to be at risk but may not qualify for official emergency response. Domestic emergency services are in principal similar to civil emergency services where public or private utility workers will perform corrective repairs to essential services and avail their service at all times; however, these are at a cost for the service. An example would be an emergency plumber &lt;ref&gt;"http://www.silvaplumbing.com.au/"| 24-hour-emergency-plumbing-repairs. Retrieved 29/09/2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emergency action principles (EAP)==
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2014}}
Emergency action principles are key 'rules' that guide the actions of rescuers and potential rescuers.  Because of the inherent nature of emergencies, no two are likely to be the same, so emergency action principles help to guide rescuers at incidents, by sticking to some basic tenets.

The adherence to (and contents of) the principles by would-be rescuers varies widely based on the [[training]] the people involved in emergency have received, the support available from emergency services (and the time it takes to arrive) and the emergency itself.

===Key emergency principle===

The key [[principle]] taught in almost all [[systems]] is that the [[rescue]]r, be they a lay person or a [[professional]], should [[Risk assessment|assess]] the situation for [[Risk|danger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/indg347.pdf|title=UK Health and Safety Executive publication on dealing with emergencies - Danger assessment is the first point|accessdate=2007-05-30|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sja.org.uk/sja/first-aid-advice/life-saving-procedures/primary-survey.aspx|title=St John Ambulance UK Primary Assessment guide|accessdate=2007-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reason that an assessment for danger is given such high priority is that it is core to emergency [[management]] that rescuers do not become secondary victims of any incident, as this creates a further emergency that must be dealt with.

A typical assessment for danger would involve [[observation]] of the [[wikt:surroundings|surroundings]], starting with the cause of the [[accident]] (e.g. a falling object) and expanding outwards to include any situational [[hazard]]s (e.g. fast moving traffic) and history or secondary information given by [[witnesses]], bystanders or the emergency services (e.g. an [[attacker]] still waiting nearby).

Once a primary danger assessment has been complete, this should not end the system of checking for danger, but should inform all other parts of the process.

If at any time the risk from any hazard poses a significant danger (as a factor of [[likelihood]] and seriousness) to the rescuer, they should consider whether they should approach the scene (or leave the scene if appropriate).

==Managing an emergency==
[[File:Em cycle.png|right|thumb|A graphic representation of the four phases in emergency management.]]
{{main article|Emergency management}}
There are many emergency services protocols that apply in an emergency, which usually start with planning before an emergency occurs. One commonly used system for demonstrating the phases is shown here on the right.

The planning phase starts at '''preparedness''', where the agencies decide how to respond to a given incident or set of circumstances.  This should ideally include lines of command and control, and division of activities between agencies.  This avoids potentially negative situations such as three separate agencies all starting an official [[emergency shelter]] for victims of a disaster.

Following an emergency occurring, the agencies then move to a '''response''' phase, where they execute their plans, and may end up improvising some areas of their response (due to gaps in the planning phase, which are inevitable due to the individual nature of most incidents).

Agencies may then be involved in '''recovery''' following the incident, where they assist in the clear up from the incident, or help the people involved overcome their mental trauma.

The final phase in the circle is '''mitigation''', which involves taking steps to ensure no re-occurrence is possible, or putting additional plans in place to ensure less damage is done.  This should feed back into the preparedness stage, with updated plans in place to deal with future emergencies, thus completing the circle.

==State of emergency==
{{main article|State of emergency}}

In the event of a major incident, such as civil unrest or a major disaster, many governments maintain the right to declare a [[state of emergency]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldbills/077/04077.12-18.html|title=UK Government Civil Contingencies Act, giving powers to declare a state of emergency|accessdate=2007-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; which gives them extensive powers over the daily lives of their citizens, and may include temporary curtailment on certain [[civil rights]], including the right to trial. For instance to discourage [[looting]] of an evacuated area, a shoot on sight policy, however unlikely to occur, may be publicized.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26195">In [[psychology]] and [[behavioral economics]], the '''endowment effect''' (also known as '''divestiture aversion''' and related to the [[mere ownership effect]] in [[social psychology]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url =|title = On the social nature of nonsocial perception: The mere ownership effect|last = Beggan|first = J.|date = 1992|journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.62.2.229|pmid = |access-date =|volume=62|issue = 2|pages=229–237}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the hypothesis that people ascribe more value to things merely because they own them.&lt;ref name="Roeckelein2006"&gt;{{cite book |first=J. E. |last=Roeckelein |title=Elsevier's Dictionary of Psychological Theories |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Yn6NZgxvssC&amp;pg=PA147 |year=2006 |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=0-08-046064-X |page=147 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Morewedge2015" /&gt;

This is typically illustrated in two ways.&lt;ref name="Morewedge2015"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Explanations of the endowment effect: an integrative review|url = |journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences|date = 2015|pages = 339–348|volume = 19|issue = 6|doi = 10.1016/j.tics.2015.04.004|pmid = 25939336|first = Carey K.|last = Morewedge|first2 = Colleen E.|last2 = Giblin}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a valuation paradigm, [[willingness to pay|people will tend to pay more]] to retain something they own than to obtain something they do not own—even when there is no cause for attachment, or even if the item was only obtained minutes ago. In an exchange paradigm, people given a good are reluctant to trade it for another good of similar value. For example, participants first given a Swiss chocolate bar were generally unwilling to trade it for a coffee mug, whereas participants first given the coffee mug were generally unwilling to trade it for the chocolate bar.

A more controversial third paradigm used to elicit the endowment effect is the [[Mere ownership effect|mere ownership]] paradigm, primarily used in experiments in psychology, marketing, and organizational behavior. In this paradigm, people who are randomly assigned to receive a good ("owners") evaluate it more positively than people who are not randomly assigned to receive the good ("controls").&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Morewedge2015" /&gt; The distinction between this paradigm and the first two is that it is not [[incentive compatibility|incentive-compatible]]. In other words, participants are not explicitly incentivized to reveal the extent to which they truly like or value the good.

The endowment effect can be equated to the behavioural model [[willingness to accept|Willingness to Accept or Pay (WTAP)]], a formula sometimes used to find out how much a consumer or person is willing to put up with or lose for different outcomes.

==Examples==
One of the most famous examples of the endowment effect in the literature is from a study by [[Daniel Kahneman]], [[Jack Knetsch]] &amp; [[Richard Thaler]],&lt;ref name="KahnemanKnetschThaler" /&gt; in which participants were given a mug and then offered the chance to sell it or trade it for an equally valued alternative (pens). They found that the amount participants required as compensation for the mug once their ownership of the mug had been established ("willingness to accept") was approximately twice as high as the amount they were willing to pay to acquire the mug ("willingness to pay").

Other examples of the endowment effect include work by [[Ziv Carmon]] and [[Dan Ariely]],&lt;ref name="Carmon" /&gt; who found that participants' hypothetical selling price ([[willingness to accept]] or WTA) for NCAA final four tournament tickets were 14 times higher than their hypothetical buying price ([[willingness to pay]] or WTP). Also, work by Hossain and List (Working Paper) discussed in the Economist in 2010,&lt;ref name="Carrots" /&gt; showed that workers worked harder to maintain ownership of a provisional awarded bonus than they did for a bonus framed as a potential yet-to-be-awarded gain. In addition to these examples, the endowment effect has been observed using different goods&lt;ref name="Hoffman" /&gt; in a wide range of different populations, including children,&lt;ref name="Harbaugh" /&gt; great apes,&lt;ref name="Kanngiesser" /&gt; and new world monkeys.&lt;ref name="Lakshminaryanan" /&gt;

==Background==
The endowment effect has been observed from ancient times:

{{quote|text=For most things are differently valued by those who have them and by those who wish to get them: what belongs to us, and what we give away, always seems very precious to us.|author=Aristotle|source=[[The Nicomachean Ethics]] book IX (F.H. Peters translation)}}

Psychologists first noted the difference between consumers' WTP and WTA as early as the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Coombs" /&gt;&lt;ref name=SlovicLichtenstein1968 /&gt; The term ''endowment effect'' however was first explicitly coined by the economist [[Richard Thaler]] in reference to the under-weighting of [[opportunity costs]] as well as the inertia introduced into a consumer's choice processes when goods included in their endowment become more highly valued than goods that are not.&lt;ref name="Thaler" /&gt; In the years that followed, extensive investigations into the endowment effect have been conducted producing a wealth of interesting empirical and theoretical findings.&lt;ref name="Hoffman" /&gt;

==Theoretical explanations==

===Loss aversion===
It was proposed by Kahneman and his colleagues that the endowment effect is, in part, due to the fact that once a person owns an item, forgoing it feels like a loss, and humans are loss-averse.&lt;ref name="KahnemanKnetschThaler" /&gt; They go on to suggest that the endowment effect, when considered as a facet of loss-aversion, would thus violate the [[Coase theorem]], and was described as inconsistent with standard [[economic]] theory which asserts that a person's [[willingness to pay]] (WTP) for a good should be equal to their [[willingness to accept]] (WTA) compensation to be deprived of the good, a hypothesis which underlies [[consumer theory]] and [[indifference curves]]. However, these claims have been disputed and other researchers claim that ownership (attribution of the item to self) and not loss aversion is the key to this phenomenon.&lt;ref name="Morewedge2009" /&gt;

===Reference-dependent accounts===
According to reference-dependent theories, consumers first evaluate the potential change in question as either being a gain or a loss. In line with [[prospect theory]] (Tversky and Kahneman, 1979&lt;ref name="KahnemanTversky1979" /&gt;), changes that are framed as losses are weighed more heavily than are the changes framed as gains. Thus an individual owning "A" amount of a good, asked how much he/she would be willing to pay to acquire "B', would be willing to pay a value (B-A) that is lower than the value that he/she would be willing to accept to sell (C-A) units; the value function for perceived gains is not as steep as the value function for perceived losses.

Figure 1 presents this explanation in graphical form.  An individual at point A, asked how much he/she would be willing to accept (WTA) as compensation to sell X units and move to point C, would demand greater compensation for that loss than he/she would be willing to pay for an equivalent gain of X units to move him/her to point B. Thus the difference between (B-A) and (C-A) would account for the endowment effect. In other words, he/she expects more money while selling; but wants to pay less while buying the same amount of goods.

===Neoclassical explanations===
Hanemann (1991),&lt;ref name="Hanemann" /&gt; develops a [[neoclassical economic theory|neoclassical]] explanation for the endowment effect, accounting for the effect without invoking [[prospect theory]].

Figure 2 presents this explanation in graphical form. In the figure, two [[indifference curves]] for a particular good X and wealth are given. Consider an individual who is given goods X such they move from point A (where they have X&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; of good X) to point B (where they have the same wealth and X&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; of good X). Their WTP represented by the vertical distance from B to C, because (after giving up that amount of wealth) the individual is indifferent about being at A or C. Now consider an individual who gives up goods such that they move from B to A. Their WTA represented by the (larger) vertical distance from A to D because (after receiving that much wealth) they are indifferent about either being at point B or D. Shogren et al. (1994)&lt;ref name="Shogren" /&gt; has reported findings that lend support to Hanemann's hypothesis.  However, Kahneman, Knetsch, and Thaler (1991)&lt;ref name="KKT91" /&gt; find that the endowment effect continues even when wealth effects are fully controlled for.

:''Figure 2 : Hanemann's Endowment Effect Explanation''

===Connection-based, or "psychological ownership" theories===
Connection-based theories propose that the attachment or association with the self-induced by owning a good is responsible for the endowment effect (for a review, see Morewedge &amp; Giblin, 2015&lt;ref name="Morewedge2015" /&gt;). Work by Morewedge, Shu, Gilbert and Wilson (2009)&lt;ref name="Morewedge2009" /&gt; provides support for these theories, as does work by Maddux et al. (2010).&lt;ref name=Maddux /&gt; For example, research participants who were given one mug and asked how much they would pay for a second mug ("owner-buyers") were WTP as much as "owners-sellers," another group of participants who were given a mug and asked how much they were WTA to sell it (both groups valued the mug in question more than buyers who were not given a mug).&lt;ref name="Morewedge2009" /&gt;  Others have argued that the short duration of ownership or highly prosaic items typically used in endowment effect type studies is not sufficient to produce such a connection, conducting research demonstrating support for those points (e.g. Liersch &amp; Rottenstreich, Working Paper).

Two paths by which attachment or self-associations increase the value of a good have been proposed (Morewedge &amp; Giblin, 2015).&lt;ref name="Morewedge2015" /&gt; An [[attachment theory]] suggests that ownership creates a non-transferrable valenced association between the self and the good. The good is incorporated into the self-concept of the owner, becoming part of her identity and imbuing it with attributes related to her self-concept. Self-associations may take the form of an emotional attachment to the good. Once an attachment has formed, the potential loss of the good is perceived as a threat to the self.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A real-world example of this would be an individual refusing to part with a college T-shirt because it supports one's identity as an alumnus of that university. A second route by which ownership may increase value is through a [[Self-referential encoding|self-referential memory effect]] (SRE) – the better encoding and recollection of stimuli associated with the self-concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Symons|first1=Cynthia S.|last2=Johnson|first2=Blair T.|title=The self-reference effect in memory: A meta-analysis|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=1997|volume=121|issue=3|pages=371–394|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.121.3.371|pmid=9136641}}&lt;/ref&gt; People have a better memory for goods they own than goods they do not own. The self-referential memory effect for owned goods may act thus as an endogenous framing effect. During a transaction, attributes of a good may be more accessible to its owners than are other attributes of the transaction. Because most goods have more positive than negative features, this accessibility bias should result in owners more positively evaluating their goods than do non-owners.&lt;ref name="Morewedge2015" /&gt;

=== Biased information processing theories ===
Several cognitive accounts of the endowment effect suggest that it is induced by the way endowment status changes the search for, attention to, recollection of, and weighting of information regarding the transaction. Frames evoked by acquisition of a good (e.g., buying, choosing it rather than another good) may increase the cognitive [[Spreading activation|accessibility]] of information favoring the decision to keep one's money and not acquire the good. By contrast, frames evoked by disposition of the good (e.g., selling) may increase the cognitive accessibility of information favoring the decision to keep the good rather than trade or dispose of it for money (for a review, see Morewedge &amp; Giblin, 2015).&lt;ref name="Morewedge2015" /&gt; For example, [[Query theory|Johnson and colleagues]] (2007)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johnson|first1=Eric J.|last2=Häubl|first2=Gerald|last3=Keinan|first3=Anat|title=Aspects of endowment: A query theory of value construction|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition|date=2007|volume=33|issue=3|pages=461–474|doi=10.1037/0278-7393.33.3.461}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that prospective mug buyers tended to recall reasons to keep their money before recalling reasons to buy the mug, whereas sellers tended to recall reasons to keep their mug before reasons to sell it for money.

===Evolutionary arguments===
Huck, Kirchsteiger &amp; Oechssler (2005)&lt;ref name="Huck" /&gt; have raised the hypothesis that natural selection may favor individuals whose preferences embody an endowment effect given that it may improve one's bargaining position in bilateral trades. Thus in a small tribal society with a few alternative sellers (i.e. where the buyer may not have the option of moving to an alternative seller), having a predisposition towards embodying the endowment effect may be evolutionarily beneficial. This may be linked with findings (Shogren, et al., 1994&lt;ref name="Shogren" /&gt;) that suggest the endowment effect is less strong when the relatively artificial sense of scarcity induced in experimental settings is lessened. Countervailing evidence for an evolutionary account is provided by studies showing that the endowment effect is moderated by exposure to modern exchange markets (e.g., hunter gatherer tribes with market exposure are more likely to exhibit the endowment effect than tribes that do not),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Evolutionary Origins of the Endowment Effect: Evidence from Hunter-Gatherers|date=2014|url = |journal = American Economic Review|pages = 1793–1805|volume = 104|issue = 6|doi = 10.1257/aer.104.6.1793|first = Coren L.|last = Apicella|first2 = Eduardo M.|last2 = Azevedo|first3 = Nicholas A.|last3 = Christakis|first4 = James H.|last4 = Fowler}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the endowment effect is moderated by culture (Maddux et al., 2010&lt;ref name="Maddux" /&gt;).

==Criticisms==
Some economists have questioned the effect's existence. Hanemann (1991)&lt;ref name="Hanemann" /&gt; noted that [[economic theory]] only suggests that WTP and WTA should be equal for goods which are close substitutes, so observed differences in these measures for goods such as environmental resources and personal health can be explained without reference to an endowment effect. Shogren, et al. (1994)&lt;ref name="Shogren" /&gt; noted that the experimental technique used by Kahneman, Knetsch and Thaler (1990)&lt;ref name="KahnemanKnetschThaler" /&gt; to demonstrate the endowment effect created a situation of artificial scarcity. They performed a more robust experiment with the same goods used by Kahneman, Knetsch and Thaler (chocolate bars and mugs) and found little evidence of the endowment effect. Others have argued that the use of hypothetical questions and experiments involving small amounts of money tells us little about actual behavior (e.g. Hoffman and Spitzer, 1993, p.&amp;nbsp;69, n. 23&lt;ref name="Hoffman" /&gt;
) with some research supporting these points (e.g., Kahneman, Knetsch and Thaler, 1990,&lt;ref name="KahnemanKnetschThaler" /&gt; Harless, 1989&lt;ref name="Harless" /&gt;) and others not (e.g. Knez, Smith and Williams, 1985)&lt;ref name="Knez" /&gt;

==Implications==
[[Herbert Hovenkamp]] (1991)&lt;ref name="Hovenkamp" /&gt; has argued that the presence of an endowment effect has significant implications for [[law]] and [[economics]], particularly in regard to [[welfare economics]]. He argues that the presence of an endowment effect indicates that a person has no [[indifference curve]] (see however Hanemann, 1991&lt;ref name="Hanemann" /&gt;) rendering the neoclassical tools of welfare analysis useless, concluding that courts should instead use WTA as a measure of value. Fischel (1995)&lt;ref name="Fischel" /&gt; however, raises the counterpoint that using WTA as a measure of value would deter the development of a nation's infrastructure and [[economic growth]]. The endowment effect changes the shape of the indifference curves substantially &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite|url=http://docplayer.net/46319513-Behavioural-indifference-curves.html |title=“Behavioral Indifference Curves,” Australasian Journal of Economics Education. 2015, 2: 1-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The endowment effect has also been raised as a possible explanation for the lack of demand for [[reverse mortgage]] opportunities in the United States (contracts in which a home owner sells back her/his property to the bank in exchange for an annuity) (Huck, Kirchsteiger &amp; Oechssler, 2005).&lt;ref name="Huck" /&gt;

The '''Equal Protection Clause''' is part of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution]]. The clause, which took effect in 1868, provides "nor shall any State [...] deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws".

A primary motivation for this clause was to validate the equality provisions contained in the [[Civil Rights Act of 1866]], which guaranteed that all citizens would have the guaranteed right to equal protection by law. As a whole, the Fourteenth Amendment marked a large shift in American constitutionalism, by applying substantially more constitutional restrictions against the states than had applied before the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].

The meaning of the Equal Protection Clause has been the subject of much debate, and inspired the well-known phrase "[[Equal justice under law|Equal Justice Under Law]]". This clause was the basis for ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' (1954), the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decision that helped to dismantle [[racial segregation in the United States|racial segregation]], and also the basis for many other decisions rejecting discrimination against, and bigotry towards, people belonging to various groups.

While the Equal Protection Clause itself applies only to state and local governments, the Supreme Court held in ''[[Bolling v. Sharpe]]'' (1954) that the [[Due Process Clause]] of the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] nonetheless imposes various equal protection requirements on the federal government.

==Text==
The Equal Protection Clause is located at the end of Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment:

{{quote|All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; ''nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws''. [emphasis added]}}

==Background==
[[File:BinghamFacingForward.jpg|right|thumb|Congressman [[John Bingham]] of [[Ohio]] was the principal framer of the Equal Protection Clause.]]
Equality as a concept has been enshrined in America since the Declaration of Independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Antieau|first=Chester James|date=1952|title=Equal Protection outside the Clause|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/3477928|journal=California Law Review|volume=40|issue=3|pages=362–377|doi=10.2307/3477928}}&lt;/ref&gt; This does not mean that it was a part of daily life or legal practices. Before the passing of the reconstruction amendments, which included the Equal Protection Clause, there were various legal challenges for the rights of Black people in America.&lt;ref name=":52"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/60/393/#tab-opinion-1964281|title=Dred Scott v. Sandford, 60 U.S. 393 (1856)|work=Justia Law|access-date=2018-11-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blacks were considered inferior, and up until the Thirteenth Amendment, it was legal to own them as slaves. Even freed Blacks had no legal rights. In fact, in one of the most infamous Supreme Court cases of all time, the Court purported that Black’s in America had no constitutional rights which they could appeal to in society or in the courts&lt;ref name=":52" /&gt;. Before this decision there was nothing barring free Black Americans from theoretical access to rights under the law, but in the 1857 Scott v Sanford decision the Supreme Court created a precedence in which Black men, whether free or in bondage, had no legal rights within America&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2007|title=Dred Scott, 150 Years Ago|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/25073625|journal=The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education|issue=55|pages=19–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Many historians believed it was this judicial decision that set the United States on the path to the Civil War which would lead the the reconstruction amendments in which the Equal Protection Clause can be found&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Swisher|first=Carl Brent|date=1957|title=Dred Scott One Hundred Years After|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/2127194|journal=The Journal of Politics|volume=19|issue=2|pages=167–183|doi=10.2307/2127194}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  

Before and during the Civil War, the Southern states violated the rights of free speech of pro-Union citizens, anti-slavery advocates, and northerners in general. During the Civil War, the Southern states stripped many white citizens of their state citizenship and banished them from the states, effectively confiscating their property.    
Shortly after the Union victory in the [[American Civil War]], the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]] was proposed by Congress and [[Article Five of the United States Constitution#Ratification|ratified]] by the states in 1865, [[Abolitionism|abolishing]] [[slavery]]. Many ex-[[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] states then adopted [[Black Codes (United States)|Black Codes]] following the war. These laws severely restricted the rights of blacks to hold [[property]], including [[real property]] (such as [[real estate]]) and many forms of [[personal property]], and to form legally enforceable [[contracts]]. These codes also created harsher criminal penalties for blacks than for whites.&lt;ref&gt;For details on the rationale for, and ratification of, the Fourteenth Amendment, see generally {{cite book |title=Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution, 1863—1877 |last=Foner |first=Eric |authorlink=Eric Foner |year=1988 |publisher=Harper &amp;amp; Row |location=New York |isbn=978-0-06-091453-0 |pages= }}, as well as {{cite book |title=Processes of Constitutional Decisionmaking |last=Brest |first=Paul |authorlink= |year=2000 |publisher=Aspen Law &amp; Business |location=Gaithersburg |isbn=978-0-7355-1250-4 |pages=241–242 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the inequality these Black Codes imposed, Congress enacted the [[Civil Rights Act of 1866]]. This Act provided that all those born in the United States were citizens (contrary to the Supreme Court's 1857 decision in ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]''), and required that "citizens of every [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] and color ... [have] full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of person and property, as is enjoyed by white citizens."&lt;ref&gt;See Brest ''et al.'' (2000), pp. 242–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

President Andrew Johnson vetoed the Civil Rights bill of 1866 amid concerns (among other things) that Congress did not have the constitutional authority to pass such a law.   Such doubts were one factor that led Congress to begin to draft and debate what would become the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, Jeffrey. ''The Supreme Court: The Personalities and Rivalries That Defined America'', p. 79 (MacMillan 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newman, Roger. ''The Constitution and its Amendments'', Vol. 4, p. 8 (Macmillan 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Congress wanted to protect [[Scalawag|white Unionists]] who were under personal and legal attack in the former Confederacy.&lt;ref&gt;Hardy, David. "Original Popular Understanding of the 14th Amendment As Reflected in the Print Media of 1866-68", Whittier Law Review, Vol. 30, p. 695 (2008-2009).&lt;/ref&gt; The effort was led by the [[Radical Republicans]] of both houses of Congress, including [[John Bingham]], [[Charles Sumner]], and [[Thaddeus Stevens]]. The most important among these, however, was Bingham, a Congressman from [[Ohio]], who drafted the language of the Equal Protection Clause.

The [[Southern United States|Southern]] states were opposed to the Civil Rights Act, but in 1865 Congress, exercising its power under Article I, section 5, clause 1 of the Constitution, to "be the Judge of the ... Qualifications of its own Members", had excluded Southerners from Congress, declaring that their states, having rebelled against the Union, could therefore not elect members to Congress. It was this fact—the fact that the Fourteenth Amendment was enacted by a "[[Rump legislature|rump]]" Congress—that allowed the Equal Protection Clause to be passed by Congress and proposed to the states. Its ratification by the former Confederate states was made a condition of their reacceptance into the Union.&lt;ref&gt;See Foner (1988), passim.

== Ratification ==
With the return to originalist interpretations of the Constitution, many wonder what was intended by the framers of the reconstruction amendments at the time of their ratification.

The 14th amendment was ratified by nervous Republicans in response to the rise of Black codes.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This ratification was irregular in many ways. First there were multiple states that rejected the 14th amendment, but when their new governments were created due to reconstruction, these new governments accepted the amendment.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/307/433/#tab-opinion-1936403|title=Coleman v.

Though the equal protection clause is one of the most cited ideas in legal theory, it received little attention during the ratification of the 14th amendment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frank|first=John P.|last2=Munro|first2=Robert F.|date=1950|title=The Original Understanding of "Equal Protection of the Laws"|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/1118709|journal=Columbia Law Review|volume=50|issue=2|pages=131–169|doi=10.2307/1118709}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead the key tenant of the Fourteenth Amendment at the time of its ratification was the Privileges and Immunities Clause&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

During the debate in Congress, more than one version of the clause was considered. Here is the first version: "The Congress shall have power to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper to secure ... to all persons in the several states equal protection in the rights of life, liberty, and property."&lt;ref name="Kelly"&gt;Kelly, Alfred. "[http://www.utexas.edu/law/journals/tlr/sources/Issue%2087.1/fn7.kelly.pdf Clio and the Court: An Illicit Love Affair]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}", ''The Supreme Court Review'' at p. 148 (1965) reprinted in ''The Supreme Court in and of the Stream of Power'' (Kermit Hall ed., Psychology Press 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; Bingham said about this version: "It confers upon Congress power to see to it that the protection given by the laws of the States shall be equal in respect to life and liberty and property to all persons."&lt;ref name="Kelly" /&gt; The main opponent of the first version was Congressman [[Robert S. Hale]] of New York, despite Bingham's public assurances that "under no possible interpretation can it ever be made to operate in the State of New York while she occupies her present proud position."&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexander Bickel|Bickel, Alexander]]. "[http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4958&amp;context=fss_papers The Original Understanding and the Segregation Decision]", ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'', Vol. 69, pp. 35-37 (1955).  Bingham was speaking on February 27, 1866.  ''See'' [http://memory.loc.gov/ll/llcg/071/0100/01061064.tif transcript].&lt;/ref&gt;

Hale ended up voting for the final version, however. When Senator [[Jacob Howard]] introduced that final version, he said:&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, Michael. "[http://lawdigitalcommons.bc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2059&amp;context=bclr Resurrecting the Privileges or Immunities Clause and Revising the Slaughter-House Cases Without Exhuming Lochner: Individual Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment]", ''Boston College Law Review'', Vol. 38 (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It prohibits the hanging of a black man for a crime for which the white man is not to be hanged. It protects the black man in his fundamental rights as a citizen with the same shield which it throws over the white man. Ought not the time to be now passed when one measure of justice is to be meted out to a member of one caste while another and a different measure is meted out to the member of another caste, both castes being alike citizens of the United States, both bound to obey the same laws, to sustain the burdens of the same Government, and both equally responsible to justice and to God for the deeds done in the body?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[39th United States Congress]] proposed the Fourteenth Amendment on June 13, 1866.  A difference between the initial and final versions of the clause was that the final version spoke not just of "equal protection" but of "the equal protection of the laws".  John Bingham said in January 1867: "no State may deny to any person the equal protection of the laws, including all the limitations for personal protection of every article and section of the Constitution ..."&lt;ref&gt;Glidden, William.  ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=XROaAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA79&amp;lpg=PA79 Congress and the Fourteenth Amendment: Enforcing Liberty and Equality in the States]'', p. 79 (Lexington Books 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;  By July 9, 1868, three-fourths of the states (28 of 37) ratified the amendment, and that is when the Equal Protection Clause became law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usconstitution.net/constamrat.html|title=Ratification of Constitutional Amendments|accessdate=February 24, 2007|last=Mount|first=Steve|date=January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history following ratification==
Bingham said in a speech on March 31, 1871 that the clause meant no State could deny to any one "the equal protection of the Constitution of the United States ... [or] any of the rights which it guarantees to all men", nor deny to anyone "any right secured to him either by the laws and treaties of the United States or of such State."&lt;ref&gt;Flack, Horace. ''The Adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment'', p. 232 (Johns Hopkins Press, 1908). For Bingham's full speech, see ''[https://books.google.com/books?pg=PA83 Appendix to the Congressional Globe, 42d Congress, 1st Sess.]'', p. 83 (March 31, 1871).&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, the meaning of equality varied from one state to another.&lt;ref&gt;requires citation&lt;/ref&gt;

Kemble shows a sleeping congress with a broken 14th Amendment. It makes the case that Congress ignored its constitutional obligations to Black Americans.]]
Four of the original thirteen states never passed any laws barring [[Anti-miscegenation laws in the United States|interracial marriage]], and the other states were divided on the issue in the Reconstruction era.&lt;ref&gt;Wallenstein, Peter. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=HFei2wFmNfsC&amp;pg=PA253 Tell the Court I Love My Wife: Race, Marriage, and Law--An American History]'', p. 253 (Palgrave Macmillan, Jan 17, 2004). The four of the original thirteen states are New Hampshire, Connecticut, New Jersey, and New York. Id.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1872, the [[Alabama Supreme Court]] ruled that the state's ban on mixed-race marriage violated the "cardinal principle" of the 1866 Civil Rights Act and of the Equal Protection Clause.&lt;ref&gt;Pascoe, Peggy. ''What Comes Naturally: Miscegenation Law and the Making of Race in America'', p. 58 (Oxford U. Press 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Almost a hundred years would pass before the U.S. Supreme Court followed that Alabama case (''Burns v. State'') in the case of ''[[Loving v. Virginia]]''. In ''Burns'', the Alabama Supreme Court said:&lt;ref&gt;Calabresi, Steven and Matthews, Andrea. "Originalism and Loving v. Virginia", ''Brigham Young University Law Review'' (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Marriage is a civil contract, and in that character alone is dealt with by the municipal law. The same right to make a contract as is enjoyed by white citizens, means the right to make any contract which a white citizen may make. The law intended to destroy the distinctions of race and color in respect to the rights secured by it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As for public schooling, no states during this era of [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] actually required separate schools for blacks.&lt;ref name=Foner&gt;[[Eric Foner|Foner, Eric]]. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=FhvA0S_op38C&amp;pg=PA321 Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution, 1863–1877]'', pp. 321–322 (HarperCollins 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; However, some states (e.g. New York) gave local districts discretion to set up schools that were deemed [[separate but equal]].&lt;ref name=Bickel&gt;[[Alexander Bickel|Bickel, Alexander]]. "[http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4958&amp;context=fss_papers The Original Understanding and the Segregation Decision]", ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'', Vol. 69, pp. 35–37 (1955).&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Iowa and Massachusetts flatly prohibited segregated schools ever since the 1850s.&lt;ref&gt;Finkelman, Paul. "[https://books.google.com/books?id=dNtyyzGUNzYC&amp;pg=PA19&amp;lpg=PA20&amp;output=html_text Rehearsal for Reconstruction: Antebellum Origins of the Fourteenth Amendment]", in ''The Facts of Reconstruction: Essays in Honor of John Hope Franklin'', p. 19 (Eric Anderson and Alfred A. Moss, eds., LSU Press, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, some states were more favorable to women's legal status than others; New York, for example, had been giving women full property, parental, and widow's rights since 1860, but not the right to vote.&lt;ref&gt;Woloch, Nancy. ''Women and the American Experience'', p. 185 (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1984).&lt;/ref&gt; No state or territory allowed [[Women's suffrage in the United States|women's suffrage]] when the Equal Protection Clause took effect in 1868.&lt;ref&gt;Wayne, Stephen. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=oVv-AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA27 Is This Any Way to Run a Democratic Election?]'', p. 27 (CQ PRESS 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, African American men had full voting rights in five states, at that time.&lt;ref&gt;McInerney, Daniel. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ReTe5oqGna4C&amp;pg=PA212 A Traveller's History of the USA]'', P. 212 (Interlink Books, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gilded Age interpretation and the ''Plessy'' decision==
In the United States, the year 1877 marked the end of Reconstruction and the start of the [[Gilded Age]]. The first truly landmark equal protection decision by the Supreme Court was ''[[Strauder v. West Virginia]]'' (1880). A black man convicted of murder by an [[all-white jury]] challenged a [[West Virginia]] [[statute]] excluding blacks from serving on juries. Exclusion of blacks from juries, the Court concluded, was a denial of equal protection to black defendants, since the jury had been "drawn from a panel from which the State has expressly excluded every man of [the defendant's] race."  At the same time, the Court explicitly allowed [[sexism]] and other types of discrimination, saying that states "may confine the selection to males, to freeholders, to citizens, to persons within certain ages, or to persons having educational qualifications. We do not believe the Fourteenth Amendment was ever intended to prohibit this. ... Its aim was against discrimination because of race or color."&lt;ref&gt;Kerber, Linda.  ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=YAIo1k6SSKcC&amp;pg=PA133 No Constitutional Right to Be Ladies: Women and the Obligations of Citizenship]'', p. 133 (Macmillan, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:The Fuller Court.jpg|thumb|left|270px|The Court that decided ''Plessy'']]The next important postwar case was the ''[[Civil Rights Cases]]'' (1883), in which the constitutionality of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1875]] was at issue. The Act provided that all persons should have "full and equal enjoyment of ... inns, [[common carriers|public conveyances]] on land or water, theatres, and other places of public amusement." In its opinion, the Court explicated what has since become known as the "[[State action (United States constitutional law)|state action doctrine]]", according to which the guarantees of the Equal Protection Clause apply only to acts done or otherwise "sanctioned in some way" by the state. Prohibiting blacks from attending plays or staying in inns was "simply a private wrong". [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Justice]] [[John Marshall Harlan]] dissented alone, saying, "I cannot resist the conclusion that the substance and spirit of the recent amendments of the Constitution have been sacrificed by a subtle and ingenious verbal criticism." Harlan went on to argue that because (1) "public conveyances on land and water" use the public highways, and (2) innkeepers engage in what is "a quasi-public employment", and (3) "places of public amusement" are licensed under the laws of the states, excluding blacks from using these services ''was'' an act sanctioned by the state.
A few years later, Justice Stanley Matthews wrote the Court's opinion in ''[[Yick Wo v. Hopkins]]'' (1886).&lt;ref&gt;''Yick Wo v. Hopkins'', {{ussc|118|356|1886}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In it the word "person" from the 14th Amendment's section has been given the broadest possible meaning by the U.S. Supreme Court:&lt;ref name="FindLaw201311234Annotation18"&gt;{{cite web|title=Annotation 18 - Fourteenth Amendment: Section 1 – Rights Guaranteed: Equal Protection of the Laws: Scope and application state action|url=http://constitution.findlaw.com/amendment14/annotation18.html#t94|publisher=FindLaw for Legal Professionals - Law &amp; Legal Information by FindLaw, a Thomson Reuters business|accessdate=23 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;These provisions are universal in their application to all persons within the territorial jurisdiction, without regard to any differences of race, of color, or of nationality, and the equal protection of the laws is a pledge of the protection of equal laws.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Thus, the Clause would not be limited to discrimination against African Americans, but would extend to other races, colors, and nationalities such as (in this case) [[Alien (law)|legal aliens]] in the United States who are Chinese citizens.

In its most contentious Gilded Age interpretation of the Equal Protection Clause, ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'' (1896), the Supreme Court upheld a [[Louisiana]] [[Jim Crow law]] that required the [[racial segregation|segregation]] of blacks and whites on [[Rail transport|railroads]] and mandated separate railway cars for members of the two races.&lt;ref&gt;For a summary of the social, political and historical background to ''Plessy'', see {{cite book |title=The Strange Career of Jim Crow |last=Woodward |first=C. Vann |authorlink=C. Vann Woodward |year=2001 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-19-514690-5 |pages=6 and pp. 69–70 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Court, speaking through Justice [[Henry B. Brown]], ruled that the Equal Protection Clause had been intended to defend equality in [[civil rights]], not equality in [[social rule|social arrangements]]. All that was therefore required of the law was reasonableness, and Louisiana's railway law amply met that requirement, being based on "the established usages, customs and traditions of the people." Justice Harlan again dissented. "Every one knows," he wrote,

{{quote|that the statute in question had its origin in the purpose, not so much to exclude white persons from railroad cars occupied by blacks, as to exclude colored people from coaches occupied by or assigned to white persons&amp;nbsp; ... [I]n view of the Constitution, in the eye of the law, there is in this country no superior, dominant, ruling class of citizens. There is no [[caste]] here. Our Constitution is color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens.}}

Such "arbitrary separation" by race, Harlan concluded, was "a badge of servitude wholly inconsistent with the civil freedom and the [[equality before the law]] established by the Constitution."&lt;ref&gt;For a skeptical evaluation of Harlan, see {{cite journal |last=Chin |first=Gabriel J. |year=1996 |title=The ''Plessy'' Myth: Justice Harlan and the Chinese Cases |journal=Iowa Law Review |volume=82 |issue= |page=151 |issn=0021-0552 |ssrn=1121505 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Harlan's philosophy of [[constitutional colorblindness]] would eventually become more widely accepted, especially after [[World War II]].

It was also in the Gilded Age that a ruling by the Supreme Court included [[headnote]]s written by John C.Bancroft, a former railway company president. Bancroft, acting as [[Reporter of Decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States|court reporter]], indicated in the headnotes that corporations were "persons", while the actual court decision itself avoided specific statements regarding the Equal Protection Clause as applied to corporations.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[http://supreme.justia.com/us/118/394/case.html Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad]'', {{ussc|118|394|1886}}. In the summary of the case Bancroft wrote that the Court declared that it did not need to hear argument on whether the Equal Protection Clause protected corporations, because "we are all of the opinion that it does." Id. at 396.  Chief Justice [[Morrison Waite]] announced from the bench that the Court would not hear argument on the question whether the equal protection clause applied to corporations: "We are all of the opinion that it does." The background and developments from this utterance are treated in H. Graham, Everyman's Constitution--Historical Essays on the Fourteenth Amendment, the ''Conspiracy Theory,'' and American Constitutionalism (1968), chs. 9, 10, and pp. 566-84. Justice [[Hugo Black]], in Connecticut General Life Ins. Co. v. Johnson, 303 U.S. 77, 85 (1938), and Justice [[William O. Douglas]], in Wheeling Steel Corp. v. Glander, 337 U.S. 562, 576 (1949), have disagreed that corporations are persons for equal protection purposes.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the legal concept of [[corporate personhood]] predates the Fourteenth Amendment.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Providence Bank v. Billings'', {{ussc|29|514|1830}}, in which Chief Justice Marshall wrote: "The great object of an incorporation is to bestow the character and properties of individuality on a collective and changing body of men." Nevertheless, the concept of corporate personhood remains controversial. See {{cite journal |last=Mayer |first=Carl J. |authorlink= |year=1990 |title=Personalizing the Impersonal: Corporations and the Bill of Rights |journal=Hastings Law Journal |volume=41 |issue= |page=577 |issn=0017-8322 |url=http://reclaimdemocracy.org/personhood/mayer_personalizing.html |accessdate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Clause was used to strike down numerous statutes applying to corporations.

==Between ''Plessy'' and ''Brown''==
[[Image:EqualJusticeUnderLaw.jpg|right|thumb|The [[United States Supreme Court|U.S. Supreme Court Building]] opened in 1935, inscribed with the words "[[Equal justice under law|Equal Justice Under Law]]" which were inspired by the Equal Protection Clause.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, Noah. ''Scorpions: The Battles and Triumphs of FDR's Great Supreme Court Justices'', p. 145 (Hachette Digital 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;]]The ''Plessy'' decision was not all bad for civil rights. For example, in ''[[Missouri ex rel. Gaines v. Canada]]'' (1938), [[Lloyd Gaines]] was a black student at [[Lincoln University of Missouri]], one of the [[historically black colleges]] in [[Missouri]]. He applied for admission to the law school at the all-white [[University of Missouri]], since Lincoln did not have a law school, but was denied admission due solely to his race. The Supreme Court, applying the separate-but-equal principle of ''Plessy'', held that a State offering a legal education to whites but not to blacks violated the Equal Protection Clause.

In ''[[Shelley v. Kraemer]]'' (1948), the Court showed increased willingness to find racial discrimination illegal. The ''Shelley'' case concerned a privately made contract that prohibited "people of the Negro or Mongolian race" from living on a particular piece of land. Seeming to go against the spirit, if not the exact letter, of ''The Civil Rights Cases'', the Court found that, although a discriminatory private contract could not violate the Equal Protection Clause, the courts' ''enforcement'' of such a contract could; after all, the Supreme Court reasoned, courts were part of the state.

The companion cases ''[[Sweatt v. Painter]]'' and ''[[McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents]]'', both decided in 1950, paved the way for a series of school integration cases. In ''McLaurin'', the [[University of Oklahoma]] had admitted McLaurin, an African-American, but had restricted his activities there: he had to sit apart from the rest of the students in the classrooms and library, and could eat in the cafeteria only at a designated table. A unanimous Court, through [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[Fred M. Vinson]], said that Oklahoma had deprived McLaurin of the equal protection of the laws:

{{quote|There is a vast difference—a Constitutional difference—between restrictions imposed by the state which prohibit the intellectual commingling of students, and the refusal of individuals to commingle where the state presents no such bar.}}

The present situation, Vinson said, was the former. In ''Sweatt'', the Court considered the constitutionality of Texas's state system of [[law school]]s, which educated blacks and whites at separate institutions. The Court (again through Chief Justice Vinson, and again with no dissenters) invalidated the school system—not because it separated students, but rather because the separate facilities were not ''equal''. They lacked "substantial equality in the educational opportunities" offered to their students.

All of these cases, as well as the upcoming ''Brown'' case, were litigated by the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]]. It was [[Charles Hamilton Houston]], a [[Harvard Law School]] graduate and law professor at [[Howard University]], who in the 1930s first began to challenge racial discrimination in the federal courts. [[Thurgood Marshall]], a former student of Houston's and the future [[United States Solicitor General|Solicitor General]] and [[Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court|Associate Justice of the Supreme Court]], joined him. Both men were extraordinarily skilled [[appellate court|appellate]] advocates, but part of their shrewdness lay in their careful choice of ''which'' cases to litigate, selecting the best legal proving grounds for their cause.&lt;ref&gt;See generally {{cite book |title=Origin of the Civil Rights Movements: Black Communities Organizing for Change |last=Morris |first=Aldon D. |authorlink= |year=1986 |publisher=Free Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-02-922130-3 |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Brown'' and its consequences==
{{See also|Brown v. Board of Education}}
In 1954 the contextualization of the equal protection clause would change forever. The Supreme Court itself recognized the gravity of the Brown v Board decision acknowledging that a split decision would be a threat to the role of the Supreme Court and even to the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Karlan|first=Pamela S.|date=2009|title=WHAT CAN BROWN® DO FOR YOU?: NEUTRAL PRINCIPLES AND THE STRUGGLE OVER THE EQUAL PROTECTION CLAUSE|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/20684748|journal=Duke Law Journal|volume=58|issue=6|pages=1049–1069}}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Earl Warren]] became Chief Justice in 1953, ''Brown'' had already come before the Court. While Vinson was still Chief Justice, there had been a preliminary vote on the case at a conference of all nine justices. At that time, the Court had split, with a majority of the justices voting that school segregation did not violate the Equal Protection Clause. Warren, however, through persuasion and good-natured cajoling—he had been an extremely successful [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] politician before joining the Court—was able to convince all eight associate justices to join his opinion declaring school segregation unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;For an exhaustive history of the ''Brown'' case from start to finish, see {{cite book |title=Simple Justice |last=Kluger |first=Richard |year=1977 |publisher=Vintage |location=New York |isbn=978-0-394-72255-9 |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In that opinion, Warren wrote:

{{quote|To separate [children in grade and high schools] from others of similar age and qualifications solely because of their race generates a feeling of inferiority as to their status in the community that may affect their hearts and minds in a way unlikely ever to be undone ... We conclude that in the field of public education the doctrine of "separate but equal" has no place. Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal.}}

Warren discouraged other justices, such as [[Robert H. Jackson]], from publishing any concurring opinion; Jackson's draft, which emerged much later (in 1988), included this statement: "Constitutions are easier amended than social customs, and even the North never fully conformed its racial practices to its professions".&lt;ref&gt;Shimsky, MaryJane. ''"Hesitating Between Two Worlds": The Civil Rights Odyssey of Robert H. Jackson'', p. 468 (ProQuest, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''I Dissent: Great Opposing Opinions in Landmark Supreme Court Cases'', pp. 133–151 (Mark Tushnet, ed. Beacon Press, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; The Court set the case for re-argument on the question of how to implement the decision. In ''[[Brown II]]'', decided in 1954, it was concluded that since the problems identified in the previous opinion were local, the solutions needed to be so as well. Thus the court devolved authority to local [[board of education|school boards]] and to the [[United States district court|trial courts]] that had originally heard the cases. (''Brown'' was actually a consolidation of four different cases from four different states.) The trial courts and localities were told to desegregate with "all deliberate speed".

[[File:Warren Court 1953.jpg|thumb|left|270px|The Court that decided ''Brown'']]Partly because of that enigmatic phrase, but mostly because of self-declared "[[massive resistance]]" in the South to the desegregation decision, [[racial integration|integration]] did not begin in any significant way until the mid-1960s and then only to a small degree. In fact, much of the integration in the 1960s happened in response not to ''Brown'' but to the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. The Supreme Court intervened a handful of times in the late 1950s and early 1960s, but its next major desegregation decision was not until ''[[Green v. School Board of New Kent County]]'' (1968), in which Justice [[William J. Brennan]], writing for a unanimous Court, rejected a "freedom-of-choice" school plan as inadequate. This was a significant decision; freedom-of-choice plans had been very common responses to ''Brown''. Under these plans, parents could choose to send their children to either a formerly white or a formerly black school. Whites almost never opted to attend black-identified schools, however, and blacks rarely attended white-identified schools.

In response to ''Green'', many Southern districts replaced freedom-of-choice with geographically based schooling plans; because [[residential segregation]] was widespread, little integration was accomplished. In 1971, the Court in ''[[Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education]]'' approved [[Desegregation busing|busing]] as a remedy to segregation; three years later, though, in the case of ''[[Milliken v. Bradley]]'' (1974), it set aside a lower court order that had required the busing of students ''between'' [[school district|districts]], instead of merely ''within'' a district. ''Milliken'' basically ended the Supreme Court's major involvement in school desegregation; however, up through the 1990s many federal trial courts remained involved in school desegregation cases, many of which had begun in the 1950s and 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;For a comprehensive history of school desegregation from ''Brown'' through ''Milliken'' (one on which this article relies for its assertions), see Brest ''et al.'' (2000), pp. 768–794.&lt;/ref&gt;

The curtailment of busing in ''Milliken v. Bradley'' is one of several reasons that have been cited to explain why equalized educational opportunity in the United States has fallen short of completion. In the view of various liberal scholars, the election of [[Richard Nixon]] in 1968 meant that the executive branch was no longer behind the Court's constitutional commitments.&lt;ref&gt;For the history of the [[United States|American]] political branches' engagement with the Supreme Court's commitment to desegregation (and vice versa), see {{cite book |title=The Warren Court and American Politics |last=Powe |first=Lucas A., Jr. |authorlink= |year=2001 |publisher=Belknap Press |location=Cambridge, MA |isbn=978-0-674-00683-6 |pages= }}, and {{cite book |title=Judgment Days: Lyndon Baines Johnson, Martin Luther King, Jr., and the Laws That Changed America |last=Kotz |first=Nick |authorlink= |year=2004 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston |isbn=978-0-618-08825-6 |pages= }} For more on the debate summarized in the text, see, e.g., {{cite book |title=The Hollow Hope: Can Courts Bring About Social Change? |last=Rosenberg |first=Gerald N. |authorlink= |year=1993 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |isbn=978-0-226-72703-5 |pages= }}, and {{cite journal |last=Klarman |first=Michael J. |year=1994 |title=''Brown'', Racial Change, and the Civil Rights Movement |journal=Virginia Law Review |volume=80 |issue=1|pages=7–150 |quote= |doi=10.2307/1073592 |jstor= 1073592 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the Court itself decided in ''[[San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez]]'' (1973) that the Equal Protection Clause allows—but does not require—a state to provide equal educational funding to all students within the state.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Troy. "Education Finance Reform Litigation and Separation of Powers: Kentucky Makes Its Contribution," ''Kentucky Law Journal'', Vol. 80 (1991): 309, 310.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the Court's decision in ''[[Pierce v. Society of Sisters]]'' (1925) allowed families to opt out of public schools, despite "inequality in economic resources that made the option of private schools available to some and not to others", as [[Martha Minow]] has put it.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martha Minow|Minow, Martha]]. "Confronting the Seduction of Choice: Law, Education and American Pluralism", ''[[Yale Law Journal]]'', Vol. 120, p. 814, 819-820 (2011)(''Pierce'' "entrenched the pattern of a two-tiered system of schooling, which sanctions private opt-outs from publicly run schools").&lt;/ref&gt;

American public school systems, especially in large metropolitan areas, to a large extent are still ''[[de facto]]'' segregated. Whether due to ''Brown'', or due to Congressional action, or due to societal change, the percentage of black students attending majority-black school districts decreased somewhat until the early 1980s, at which point that percentage began to increase. By the late 1990s, the percentage of black students in mostly minority school districts had returned to about what it was in the late 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;For data and analysis, see {{cite web|url=http://www.civilrightsproject.harvard.edu/research/deseg/Schools_More_Separate.pdf |format=PDF |title=Schools More Separate |accessdate=2008-07-16 |author=Orfield |date=July 2001 |work=Harvard University Civil Rights Project |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070628215819/http://www.civilrightsproject.harvard.edu/research/deseg/Schools_More_Separate.pdf |archivedate=2007-06-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1]]'' (2007), the Court held that, if a school system became racially imbalanced due to social factors other than governmental racism, then the state is not as free to integrate schools as if the state had been at fault for the racial imbalance. This is especially evident in the charter school system where parents of students can pick which schools their children attend based on the amenities provided by that school and the needs of the child. It seems that race is a factor in the choice of charter school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jacobs|first=Nicholas|title=Racial, Economic, and Linguistic Segregation: Analyzing Market Supports in the District of Columbia's Public Charter Schools.|journal=Education and Urban Society|date=8 August 2011|volume=45|issue=1|pages=120–141|doi=10.1177/0013124511407317|url=http://eus.sagepub.com/content/45/1/120|accessdate=28 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application to federal government==
By its terms, the clause restrains only state governments. However, the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]]'s [[due process]] guarantee, beginning with ''[[Bolling v. Sharpe]]'' (1954), has been interpreted as imposing some of the same restrictions on the federal government: "Though the Fifth Amendment does not contain an equal protection clause, as does the Fourteenth Amendment which applies only to the States, the concepts of equal protection and due process are not mutually exclusive."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=347&amp;invol=497 |title=FindLaw &amp;#124; Cases and Codes |publisher=Caselaw.lp.findlaw.com |date=1954-05-17 |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'' (2003) the Supreme Court added: "Equality of treatment and the due process right to demand respect for conduct protected by the substantive guarantee of liberty are linked in important respects, and a decision on the latter point advances both interests" &lt;ref&gt;Lawrence v. Texas, {{Ussc|539|598|2003}}, at page 2482&lt;/ref&gt;
Some scholars have argued that the Court's decision in ''Bolling'' should have been reached on other grounds. For example, [[Michael W. McConnell]] has written that Congress never "required that the schools of the District of Columbia be segregated."&lt;ref&gt;Balkin, J. M.; Bruce A. Ackerman (2001). "Part II". What Brown v. Board of Education should have said : the nation's top legal experts rewrite America's landmark civil rights decision. et al. New York University Press. p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt; According to that rationale, the segregation of schools in Washington D.C. was unauthorized and therefore illegal.

==Tiered scrutiny==
Despite the undoubted importance of ''Brown'', much of modern equal protection jurisprudence originated in other cases, though not everyone agrees about ''which'' other cases. Some scholars assert that the opinion of Justice [[Harlan Stone]] in ''[[United States v. Carolene Products Co.]]'' (1938)&lt;ref&gt;304 U.S. 144, 152 n.4 (1938). For a theory of judicial review based on Stone's footnote, see Ely, John Hart (1981). ''Democracy and Distrust''. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|0-674-19637-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; contained a footnote that was a critical turning point for equal protection jurisprudence,&lt;ref name=Goldstein&gt;Goldstein, Leslie. "[https://www.law.upenn.edu/journals/conlaw/articles/volume4/issue2/Goldstein4U.Pa.J.Const.L.372(2002).pdf Between the Tiers: The New(est) Equal Protection and Bush v. Gore]", ''University of Pennsylvania Journal of Constitutional Law'', Vol. 4, p. 372 (2002) .&lt;/ref&gt; but that assertion is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;Farber, Daniel and Frickey, Philip. "[http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2542&amp;context=facpubs Is Carolene Products Dead--Reflections on Affirmative Action and the Dynamics of Civil Rights Legislation]", ''California Law Review'', Vol. 79, p. 685 (1991). Farber and Frickey point out that "only Chief Justice Hughes, Justice Brandeis, and Justice Roberts joined Justice Stone's footnote", and in any event "It is simply a myth ... that the process theory of footnote four in Carolene Products is, or ever has been, the primary justification for invalidating laws embodying prejudice against racial minorities."&lt;/ref&gt;

Whatever its precise origins, the basic idea of the modern approach is that more judicial scrutiny is triggered by purported discrimination that involves "[[fundamental rights]]" (such as the right to procreation), and similarly more judicial scrutiny is also triggered if the purported victim of discrimination has been targeted because he or she belongs to a "[[suspect classification]]" (such as a single racial group). This modern doctrine was pioneered in ''[[Skinner v. Oklahoma]]'' (1942), which involved depriving certain criminals of the fundamental right to procreate:&lt;ref&gt;''Skinner v. Oklahoma'', 316 U.S. 535 (1942). Sometimes the "suspect" classification strand of the modern doctrine is attributed to ''[[Korematsu v. United States]]'' (1944), but ''Korematsu'' did not involve the Fourteenth Amendment, and moreover it came later than the ''Skinner'' opinion (which clearly stated that both deprivation of fundamental rights as well as oppression of a particular race or nationality were invidious).&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;When the law lays an unequal hand on those who have committed intrinsically the same quality of offense and sterilizes one and not the other, it has made as invidious a discrimination as if it had selected a particular race or nationality for oppressive treatment.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Until 1976, the Supreme Court usually ended up dealing with discrimination by using one of two possible levels of scrutiny: what has come to be called "[[strict scrutiny]]" (when a suspect class or fundamental right is involved), or instead the more lenient "[[rational basis review]]". Strict scrutiny means that a challenged statute must be "narrowly tailored" to serve a "compelling" government interest, and must not have a "less restrictive" alternative. In contrast, rational basis scrutiny merely requires that a challenged statute be "reasonably related" to a "legitimate" government interest.

However, in the 1976 case of ''[[Craig v. Boren]]'', the Court added another tier of scrutiny, called "[[intermediate scrutiny]]", regarding gender discrimination. The Court may have added other tiers too, such as "enhanced rational basis" scrutiny,&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, Inc.]]'' (1985)&lt;/ref&gt; and "exceedingly persuasive basis" scrutiny.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[United States v. Virginia]]'' (1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

All of this is known as "tiered" scrutiny, and it has had many critics, including Justice [[Thurgood Marshall]] who argued for a "spectrum of standards in reviewing discrimination", instead of discrete tiers.&lt;ref name=Fleming /&gt; Justice [[John Paul Stevens]] argued for only one level of scrutiny, given that "there is only one Equal Protection Clause".&lt;ref name=Fleming&gt;Fleming, James. "[http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/flr/vol74/iss4/26 'There is Only One Equal Protection Clause': An Appreciation of Justice Stevens's Equal Protection Jurisprudence]", ''Fordham Law Review'', Vol. 74, p. 2301, 2306 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; The whole tiered strategy developed by the Court is meant to reconcile the principle of equal protection with the reality that most laws necessarily discriminate in some way.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Romer v. Evans]]'', 517 U.S. 620, 631 (1996): "the equal protection of the laws must coexist with the practical necessity that most legislation classifies for one purpose or another, with resulting disadvantage to various groups or persons."&lt;/ref&gt;

Choosing the standard of scrutiny can determine the outcome of a case, and the strict scrutiny standard is often described as "strict in theory and fatal in fact".&lt;ref&gt;Curry, James et al. ''Constitutional Government: The American Experience'', p. 282 (Kendall Hunt 2003) (attributing the phrase to Gerald Gunther).&lt;/ref&gt; In order to select the correct level of scrutiny, Justice [[Antonin Scalia]] urged the Court to identify rights as "fundamental" or identify classes as "suspect" by analyzing what was understood when the Equal Protection Clause was adopted, instead of based upon more subjective factors.&lt;ref&gt;Domino, John. ''Civil Rights &amp; Liberties in the 21st Century'', pp. 337-338 (Pearson 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discriminatory intent and disparate impact==
{{Main|Disparate impact}}
Because inequalities can be caused either intentionally or unintentionally, the Supreme Court has decided that the Equal Protection Clause itself does not forbid governmental policies that unintentionally lead to racial disparities, though Congress may have some power under other clauses of the Constitution to address unintentional disparate impacts. This subject was addressed in the seminal case of ''[[Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Corp.]]'' (1977). In that case, the plaintiff, a housing developer, sued a city in the suburbs of [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] that had refused to [[zoning|re-zone]] a plot of land on which the plaintiff intended to build low-income, racially integrated housing. On the face, there was no clear evidence of racially discriminatory intent on the part of [[Arlington Heights, Illinois|Arlington Heights's]] planning commission. The result was racially disparate, however, since the refusal supposedly prevented mostly African-Americans and Hispanics from moving in. Justice [[Lewis Franklin Powell Jr.|Lewis Powell]], writing for the Court, stated, "Proof of racially discriminatory intent or purpose is required to show a violation of the Equal Protection Clause." Disparate impact merely has an [[evidence|evidentiary]] value; absent a "stark" pattern, "impact is not determinative."

The result in ''Arlington Heights'' was similar to that in ''[[Washington v. Davis]]'' (1976), and has been defended on the basis that the Equal Protection Clause was not designed to guarantee [[equality of outcome|equal outcomes]], but rather [[equal opportunity|equal opportunities]]; if a legislature wants to correct unintentional but racially disparate effects, it may be able to do so through further legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://left2right.typepad.com/main/2005/03/constitutional__1.html |title=Constitutional Rights: Two |accessdate= |last=Herzog |first=Don |date=March 22, 2005 |work=Left2Right |publisher=}} Note that the Court has put significant limits on the [[congressional power of enforcement]]. See ''[[City of Boerne v. Flores]]'' (1997), ''[[Board of Trustees of the University of Alabama v. Garrett]]'' (2001), and ''[[United States v. Morrison]]'' (2000). The Court has also interpreted federal statutory law as limiting the power of states to correct disparate effects. See ''[[Ricci v. DeStefano]]'' (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible for a discriminating state to hide its true intention, and one possible solution is for disparate impact to be considered as stronger evidence of discriminatory intent.&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite journal |last=Krieger |first=Linda Hamilton |authorlink= |year=1995 |title=The Content of Our Categories: A Cognitive Bias Approach to Discrimination and Equal Protection Opportunity |journal=[[Stanford Law Review]] |volume=47 |issue= 6|pages=1161–1248 |id= |quote= |doi=10.2307/1229191 |jstor= 1229191 }}, and {{cite journal |last=Lawrence |first=Charles R., III |authorlink= |year=1987 |title=Reckoning with Unconscious Racism |journal=Stanford Law Review |volume=39 |issue= 2|pages=317–388 |quote= |doi=10.2307/1228797 |jstor= 1228797 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This debate, though, is currently academic, since the Supreme Court has not changed its basic approach as outlined in ''Arlington Heights''.

For an example of how this rule limits the Court's powers under the Equal Protection Clause, see ''[[McClesky v. Kemp]]'' (1987). In that case a black man was convicted of murdering a white police officer and sentenced to death in the state of Georgia. A study found that killers of whites were more likely to be sentenced to death than were killers of blacks.&lt;ref name="Baldus1983"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Baldus |first=David C. |authorlink= |author2=Pulaski, Charles |author3=Woodworth, George  |year=1983 |title=Comparative Review of Death Sentences: An Empirical Study of the Georgia Experience |journal=Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology |volume=74 |issue=3 |pages=661–753 |doi=10.2307/1143133 |jstor= 1143133|url=https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/jclc/vol74/iss3/2 |type=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Court found that the defense had failed to prove that such data demonstrated the requisite discriminatory intent by the Georgia legislature and executive branch.

==Voting rights==
[[File:John Marshall Harlan II official.jpg|thumb|right|270px|Justice John Marshall Harlan II sought to interpret the Equal Protection Clause in the context of Section 2 of the same amendment]]The Supreme Court ruled in ''[[Nixon v. Herndon]]'' (1927) that the Fourteenth Amendment prohibited denial of the vote based on race. The first modern application of the Equal Protection Clause to voting law came in ''[[Baker v. Carr]]'' (1962), where the Court ruled that the districts that sent representatives to the [[Tennessee]] [[State legislature (United States)|state legislature]] were so malapportioned (with some legislators representing ten times the number of residents as others) that they violated the Equal Protection Clause.

It may seem counterintuitive that the Equal Protection Clause should provide for equal [[voting rights]]; after all, it would seem to make the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]] and the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth Amendment]] redundant. Indeed, it was on this argument, as well as on the legislative history of the Fourteenth Amendment, that Justice [[John Marshall Harlan II|John M. Harlan]] (the grandson of the earlier Justice Harlan) relied in his dissent from ''Reynolds''. Harlan quoted the congressional debates of 1866 to show that the framers did not intend for the Equal Protection Clause to extend to voting rights, and in reference to the Fifteenth and Nineteenth Amendments, he said:

{{quote|If constitutional amendment was the only means by which all men and, later, women, could be guaranteed the right to vote at all, even for ''federal'' officers, how can it be that the far less obvious right to a particular kind of apportionment of ''state'' legislatures ... can be conferred by judicial construction of the Fourteenth Amendment?'' [Emphasis in the original.]}}

Harlan also relied on the fact that Section Two of the Fourteenth Amendment "expressly recognizes the States' power to deny 'or in any way' abridge the right of their inhabitants to vote for 'the members of the [state] Legislature.'"&lt;ref&gt;Van Alstyne, William. "The Fourteenth Amendment, the Right to Vote, and the Understanding of the Thirty-Ninth Congress", ''Supreme Court Review'', p. 33 (1965).&lt;/ref&gt; Section Two of the Fourteenth Amendment provides a specific federal response to such actions by a state: reduction of a state's representation in Congress. However, the Supreme Court has instead responded that voting is a "fundamental right" on the same plane as marriage (''[[Loving v. Virginia]]''); for any discrimination in fundamental rights to be constitutional, the Court requires the legislation to pass strict scrutiny. Under this theory, equal protection jurisprudence has been applied to voting rights.

A recent use of equal protection doctrine came in ''[[Bush v. Gore]]'' (2000). At issue was the controversial recount in [[Florida]] in the aftermath of the [[U.S. presidential election, 2000|2000 presidential election]]. There, the Supreme Court held that the different standards of counting ballots across Florida violated the equal protection clause. It was not this holding that proved especially controversial among commentators, and indeed, the proposition gained seven out of nine votes; Justices [[David Souter|Souter]] and [[Stephen Breyer|Breyer]] joined the majority of five—but only, it should be emphasized, for the finding that there was an Equal Protection violation. Much more controversial was the remedy that the Court chose, namely, the cessation of a statewide recount.&lt;ref&gt;For criticisms as well as several defenses of the Court's decision, see Bush v. Gore'': The Question of Legitimacy'', edited by {{cite book |title= Bush v.

==Sex, disability, and sexual orientation==
Originally, the Fourteenth Amendment did not forbid sex discrimination to the same extent as other forms of discrimination. On the one hand, Section Two of the amendment specifically discouraged states from interfering with the voting rights of "males", which made the amendment anathema to many women when it was proposed in 1866.&lt;ref&gt;Cullen-Dupont, Kathryn. ''Encyclopedia of Women's History in America'', pp. 91-92 (Infobase Publishing, Jan 1, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, as feminists like [[Victoria Woodhull]] pointed out, the word "person" in the Equal Protection Clause was apparently chosen deliberately, instead of a masculine term that could have easily been used instead.&lt;ref&gt;Hymowitz, Carol and Weissman, Michaele. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=0c-adTP64AsC&amp;pg=PT128 A History of Women in America]'', p. 128 (Random House Digital, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, the U.S. Supreme Court decided ''[[Reed v. Reed]],'' extending the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to protect women from sex discrimination, in situations where there is no rational basis for the discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.jrank.org/pages/24338/Reed-v-Reed-Significance.html Reed v. Reed - Significance, Notable Trials and Court Cases - 1963 to 1972]&lt;/ref&gt; That level of scrutiny was boosted to an intermediate level in ''[[Craig v. Boren]]'' (1976).&lt;ref&gt;''Craig v. Boren'', 429 U.S. 190 (1976).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:2007 WY Proof Rev.png|thumb|left|Each state can guarantee more equality than does the Equal Protection Clause.  For example, the state of [[Wyoming]] granted women the right to vote even before the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth Amendment]] required it.]] The Supreme Court has been disinclined to extend full "[[suspect classification]]" status (thus making a law that categorizes on that basis subject to greater judicial scrutiny) for groups other than racial minorities and religious groups. In ''[[City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, Inc.]]'' (1985), the Court refused to make the [[developmental disability|developmentally disabled]] a suspect class. Many commentators have noted, however&amp;mdash;and Justice Thurgood Marshall so notes in his partial concurrence&amp;mdash;that the Court did appear to examine the City of Cleburne's denial of a permit to a group home for intellectually disabled people with a significantly higher degree of scrutiny than is typically associated with the rational-basis test.&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite journal |last=Pettinga |first=Gayle Lynn |authorlink= |year=1987 |title=Rational Basis with Bite: Intermediate Scrutiny by Any Other Name |journal=Indiana Law Journal |volume=62 |issue= |page=779 |issn=0019-6665 |url= |accessdate= |quote= }}; {{cite journal |last=Wadhwani |first=Neelum J. |authorlink= |year=2006 |title=Rational Reviews, Irrational Results |journal=Texas Law Review |volume=84 |issue= |pages=801, 809&amp;ndash;811 |issn=0040-4411 |url= |accessdate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court's decision in ''[[Romer v. Evans]]'' (1996) struck down a [[Colorado]] constitutional amendment aimed at denying homosexuals "minority status, quota preferences, protected status or [a] claim of discrimination." The Court rejected as "implausible" the dissent's argument that the amendment would not deprive homosexuals of general protections provided to everyone else but rather would merely prevent "special treatment of homosexuals."&lt;ref&gt;Kuligowski, Monte. "Romer v. Evans: Judicial Judgment or Emotive Utterance?," ''Journal of Civil Rights and Economic Development'', Vol. 12 (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; Much as in ''City of Cleburne'', the ''Romer'' decision seemed to employ a markedly higher level of scrutiny than the nominally applied rational-basis test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Joslin |first=Courtney |authorlink= |year=1997 |title=Equal Protection and Anti-Gay Legislation |journal=Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Liberties Law Review |volume=32 |issue= |pages=225, 240 |issn=0017-8039 |url= |accessdate= |quote=The ''Romer'' Court applied a more 'active,' ''Cleburne''-like rational basis standard ...}}; {{cite journal |last=Farrell |first=Robert C. |authorlink= |year=1999 |title=Successful Rational Basis Claims in the Supreme Court from the 1971 Term Through ''Romer v.

In ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'' (2003), the Court struck down a Texas statute prohibiting [[homosexual]] [[sodomy]] on substantive due process grounds. In Justice [[Sandra Day O'Connor]]'s opinion concurring in the judgment, however, she argued that by prohibiting only ''homosexual'' sodomy, and not ''heterosexual'' sodomy as well, Texas's statute did not meet rational-basis review under the Equal Protection Clause; her opinion prominently cited ''City of Cleburne'', and also relied in part on ''Romer''. Notably, O'Connor's opinion did not claim to apply a higher level of scrutiny than mere rational basis, and the Court has not extended suspect-class status to [[sexual orientation]].

While the courts have applied rational-basis scrutiny to classifications based on sexual orientation, it has been argued that discrimination based on sex should be interpreted to include discrimination based on sexual orientation, in which case intermediate scrutiny could apply to gay rights cases.&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite journal |last=Koppelman |first=Andrew |authorlink= |year=1994 |title=Why Discrimination against Lesbians and Gay Men is Sex Discrimination |journal=New York University Law Review |volume=69 |issue= |page=197 |issn=0028-7881 |url= |accessdate= |quote= }}; see also &lt;u&gt;[[Fricke v.

In preventing Aaron Fricke from attending the senior reception, the school has afforded disparate treatment to a certain class of students those wishing to attend the reception with companions of the same sex."]&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars disagree, arguing that "homophobia" is distinct from sexism, in a sociological sense, and so treating it as such would be an unacceptable judicial shortcut.&lt;ref&gt;Gerstmann, Evan. '' [https://books.google.com/books?id=6o9FQgK7H8gC&amp;pg=PA55 Same Sex Marriage and the Constitution]'', p. 55 (Cambridge University Press, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the Court struck down part of the federal [[Defense of Marriage Act]], in ''[[United States v. Windsor]]''. No state statute was in question, and therefore the Equal Protection Clause did not apply. The Court did employ similar principles, however, in combination with [[federalism]] principles. The Court did not purport to use any level of scrutiny more demanding than rational basis review, according to law professor [[Erwin Chemerinsky]].&lt;ref&gt;Chemerinsky, Erwin. "[http://m.law.com/module/alm/app/nlj.do#!/article/1029801790 Justice Kennedy's World] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130709102734/http://m.law.com/module/alm/app/nlj.do#!/article/1029801790 |date=2013-07-09 }}", ''[[The National Law Journal]]'' (July 1, 2013): "There is another similarity between his opinion in Windsor and his earlier ones in Romer and Lawrence: the Supreme Court invalidated the law without using heightened scrutiny for sexual-orientation discrimination ... A law based on animus fails to meet even rational-basis review so there was no need to adopt a higher level of scrutiny."&lt;/ref&gt; The four dissenting justices argued that the authors of the statute were rational.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/public/mobile/document/United_States_v_Windsor_No_12307_2013_BL_168683_US_June_26_2013_C/1 United States v. Windsor]'', No. 12-307, 2013 BL 169620, 118 FEP Cases 1417 (U.S. June 26, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the Supreme Court held [[Obergefell v. Hodges|in a 5–4 decision]] that the fundamental right to marry is guaranteed to same-sex couples by both the Due Process Clause and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and required all states to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples and to recognize same-sex marriages validly performed in other jurisdictions.

==Affirmative action==
{{See also|Affirmative action in the United States}}
[[Affirmative action]] is the consideration of race, gender, or other factors, to benefit an underrepresented group or to address past injustices done to that group. Individuals who belong to the group are preferred over those who do not belong to the group, for example in educational admissions, hiring, promotions, awarding of contracts, and the like.&lt;ref name="Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy"&gt;{{cite web
| publisher = Stanford University| title = Affirmative Action| url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/affirmative-action/
| accessdate =4/6/2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such action may be used as a "tie-breaker" if all other factors are inconclusive, or may be achieved through [[racial quota|quota]]s, which allot a certain number of benefits to each group.

During [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], Congress enacted race-conscious programs primarily to assist newly freed slaves who had personally been denied many advantages earlier in their lives. Such legislation was enacted by many of the same people who framed the Equal Protection Clause, though that clause did not apply to such federal legislation, and instead only applied to state legislation.&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite journal |last=Schnapper |first=Eric |authorlink= |year=1985 |title=Affirmative Action and the Legislative History of the Fourteenth Amendment |journal=Virginia Law Review |volume=71 |issue= 5|pages=753–798 |quote= |doi=10.2307/1073012 |url=http://www.utexas.edu/vp/irla/Documents/AFFIRM.ACTION.LEGISLATIVE.HISTORY.%20FOURTEENTH%20AMENDMENT.pdf|jstor=1073012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the Equal Protection Clause does not apply to private universities and other private businesses, which are free to practice affirmative action unless prohibited by federal statute or state law.

Several important affirmative action cases to reach the Supreme Court have concerned government [[independent contractor|contractor]]s&amp;mdash;for instance, ''[[Adarand Constructors v. Peña]]'' (1995) and ''[[City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co.]]'' (1989). But the most famous cases have dealt with affirmative action as practiced by [[public university|public universities]]: ''[[Regents of the University of California v. Bakke]]'' (1978), and two companion cases decided by the Supreme Court in 2003, ''[[Grutter v. Bollinger]]'' and ''[[Gratz v. Bollinger]]''.

In ''Bakke'', the Court held that racial quotas are unconstitutional, but that educational institutions could legally use race as one of many factors to consider in their [[University and college admissions|admissions]] process. In ''Grutter'' and ''Gratz'', the Court upheld both ''Bakke'' as a precedent and the admissions policy of the [[University of Michigan Law School]]. In [[dicta]], however, Justice O'Connor, writing for the Court, said she expected that in 25 years, racial preferences would no longer be necessary. In ''Gratz'', the Court invalidated Michigan's undergraduate admissions policy, on the grounds that unlike the law school's policy, which treated race as one of many factors in an admissions process that looked to the individual applicant, the undergraduate policy used a point system that was excessively mechanistic.

In these affirmative action cases, the Supreme Court has employed, or has said it employed, strict scrutiny, since the affirmative action policies challenged by the plaintiffs categorized by race. The policy in ''Grutter'', and a Harvard College admissions policy praised by Justice Powell's opinion in ''Bakke'', passed muster because the Court deemed that they were narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling interest in diversity. On one side, critics have argued—including Justice [[Clarence Thomas]] in his dissent to ''Grutter''—that the scrutiny the Court has applied in some cases is much less searching than true strict scrutiny, and that the Court has acted not as a principled legal institution but as a biased political one.&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite web|url=http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/forum/symposium-aa/schuck.php |title=Reflections on ''Grutter'' |accessdate= |last=Schuck |first=Peter H. |date=September 5, 2003 |work=Jurist |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050909065433/http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/forum/symposium-aa/schuck.php |archivedate=2005-09-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other side, it is argued that the purpose of the Equal Protection Clause is to prevent the socio-political subordination of some groups by others, not to prevent classification; since this is so, non-invidious classifications, such as those used by affirmative action programs, should not be subjected to heightened scrutiny.&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite journal |last=Siegel |first=Reva B. |authorlink=Reva Siegel |year=2004 |title=Equality Talk: Antisubordination and Anticlassification Values in Constitutional Struggles over ''Brown'' |journal=[[Harvard Law Review]] |volume=117 |issue= 5|pages=1470–1547 |id= |quote= |doi=10.2307/4093259 |jstor= 4093259 |url=http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/fss_papers/1102 |type=Submitted manuscript }}; {{cite journal |last=Carter |first=Stephen L. |authorlink=Stephen L.

In [[Anglo-Saxon law]], an '''exclusive right''', or '''exclusivity''', is a de facto, non-tangible [[prerogative]] existing in law (that is, the [[power (sociology)|power]] or, in a wider sense, [[right]]) to perform an action or acquire a benefit and to permit or deny others the right to perform the same action or to acquire the same benefit. A "prerogative" is in effect an exclusive right. The term is restricted for use for official state or sovereign (i.e., constitutional) powers. Exclusive rights are a form of [[monopoly]].

Exclusive rights can be established by law or by contractual obligation, but the scope of enforceability will depend upon the extent to which others are bound by the instrument establishing the exclusive right; thus in the case of contractual rights, only persons that are parties to a contract will be affected by the exclusivity.

Exclusive rights may be granted in [[property law]], [[copyright law]], [[patent law]],  in relation to [[public utility|public utilities]], or, in some jurisdictions, in other ''[[sui generis]]'' legislation. Many scholars argue that such rights form the basis for the concepts of [[property (ownership right)|property]] and [[ownership]].

Privately granted rights, created by [[contract]], may occasionally appear very similar to exclusive rights, but are only enforceable against the grantee, and not the world at large.

==Types of exclusive rights==

===Property===

In relation to [[property]], an exclusive right will, for the most part, arise when something tangible is acquired; as a result, others are prevented from exercising control of that thing. For example, a person may prohibit others from entering and using their [[real property|land]], or from taking their [[personal property|personal possessions]]. However, an exclusive right is not necessarily absolute, as an [[easement]] may allow a certain level of public access to [[private land]].

===Intellectual property===

Most [[government]]s recognize a [[Bundle of Rights|bundle of exclusive rights]] in relation to works of authorship, inventions, and identifications of origin. These rights are sometimes spoken of under the [[umbrella term]] "[[intellectual property]]."

==History and arguments==

In Anglo-Saxon property law, exclusive rights have often been the codification of pre-existing [[Norm (sociology)|social norm]]s with regard to land or [[Personal property|chattel]]s.

In [[continental Europe]] there is a view that copyrights, patents, and the like are the codification of some kind of [[Moral rights (copyright law)|moral right]], [[natural right]], or [[personamility rights|personalitlly right]]. However, such arguments can only be consistently justified through [[instrumentalism]] or [[consequentialism]], as exemplified by the reasoning inferred in [[Article One of the United States Constitution]] that copyrights and patents exist solely "To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts."

The '''Five Wisdoms'''{{refn|group=note|Sanskrit: ''pañca-jñāna''; {{bo|t=ཡེ་ཤེས་ལྔ|w=ye shes lnga}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://rywiki.tsadra.org/index.php/ye_shes_lnga Rangjung Yeshe Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese: ''go-chi''}} are five kinds of wisdoms which appear when the [[Eight Consciousnesses|mind]] is purified of the five disturbing emotions and the natural mind appears.&lt;ref group=web name="Hansen"&gt;[http://basicdharma.org/index.php/The_Five_Wisdoms Lone Hansen (Shenphen Chödron), ''The Five Wisdoms''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714194208/http://basicdharma.org/index.php/The_Five_Wisdoms |date=2014-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|Anger, jealousy, pride, attachment and ignorance&lt;ref group=web name="Hansen" /&gt;}} All of those five wisdoms are represented by one of the [[Five Dhyani Buddhas|five buddha-families]].&lt;ref group=web name="Hansen" /&gt;

==Nomenclature, orthography and etymology==
''Pañca-jñāna'' is orthographically rendered into English as:  Five Wisdoms, Five Awarenesses, Five Pristine Cognitions.

==Five Wisdoms==
The Five Wisdoms are:
# ''Tathatā-jñāna'', the wisdom of [[Suchness]] or ''[[Dharmadhatu]]'', "the bare non-conceptualizing awareness" of ''[[Śūnyatā]]'', the [[monism|universal substrate]] of the other four ''jñāna'';{{sfn|Keown|2003|p=209}}
# ''Ādarśa-jñāna'', the wisdom of "Mirror-like Awareness", "devoid of all dualistic thought and ever united with its 'content' as a mirror is with its reflections";{{sfn|Keown|2003|p=209}}{{refn|group=note|''Ādarśa'' is Sanskrit for "mirror", the term may be parsed into the [[etymon]] of ''[[darśana]]'' with a grammatical [[adposition]]}}
# ''Samatā-jñāna'', the wisdom of the "Awareness of Sameness", which perceives the sameness, the commonality of  ''[[dharmas]]'' or [[phenomena]].{{sfn|Keown|2003|p=209}}
# ''{{IAST|Pratyavekṣaṇa-jñāna}}'', the wisdom of "Investigative Awareness", that perceives the [[:wikt:specificity|specificity]], the uniqueness of ''dharmas''.{{sfn|Keown|2003|p=209}}
# ''{{IAST|Kṛty-anuṣṭhāna-jñāna}}'', the wisdom of "Accomplishing Activities", the awareness that "spontaneously carries out all that has to be done for the welfare of beings, manifesting itself in all directions".{{sfn|Keown|2003|p=209}}

The Five Wisdoms "emerge through a transformation (parāvṛtti) of the eight consciousnesses at the moment of enlightenment".{{sfn|Keown|2003|p=209}}

==Five Dhyani Buddhas==
[[Image:BuddhaLoutsSm.jpg|thumb|Cloth with painting of the Buddha]]

The idea of the Five Wisdoms "underwent a considerable development" within [[Tibetan Buddhism]] where they are "symbolized or embodied" in the [[Five Dhyani Buddhas]].{{sfn|Keown|2003|p=209}}

According to [[Tenzin Wangyal]], the [[Five Pure Lights]] become the [[Kleshas (Buddhism)|Five Poisons]] if we remain deluded, or the Five Wisdoms and the [[Five Buddha Families]] if we recognize their purity.&lt;ref&gt;Wangyal, Tenzin (author) &amp; Dahlby, Mark (editor). ''Healing with Form, Energy and Light: The Five Elements in Tibetan Shamanism, Tantra, and Dzogchen''.  Ithaca, NY, USA: Snow Lion Publications.  {{ISBN|1-55939-176-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Five Wisdoms, and the accompanying Five Buddhas, are represented in Tibetan Buddhism by the "symbolic bone ornaments".{{refn|group=note|Skt: aṣṭhiamudrā; Tib: rus pa'i rgyanl phyag rgya}}&lt;ref name="Kongtrul 2005 p.493"&gt;[[Jamgon Kongtrul|Kongtrul, Jamgön]] (author); (English translators: Guarisco, Elio; McLeod, Ingrid) (2005).

Bolder, Colorado, USA: Snow Lion Publications. {{ISBN|1-55939-210-X}} (alk.paper) p.493&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Hevajra Tantra]]'' associates the Symbolic Bone Ornaments directly with the Five Wisdoms:{{refn|group=note|These are elucidated by a commentary to the ''Hevajra Tantra'' by [[Jamgön Kongtrul]].&lt;ref&gt;refer CH, f. 66a6-b1; where CH = Kongtrul Lodrö Taé, ''Disclosing the Secret of the Invincible Vajra: Phrase by Phrase Commentary on the Hevajra Tantra Two Examinations'' (dPal kye'i rdo rje'i rgyud kyi rgyal po brtag pa gnyis pa'i tshig don rnam par 'grol ba bzhom med rdo rje'i gsang ba 'byed pa).

# the 'wheel-like' (Tib.: 'khor lo) 'crown ornament' (sometimes called 'crown jewel') (Tib.: gtsug gi nor bu), symbolic of [[Akshobhya]] and 'mirror-like pristine awareness' (Ādarśa-jñāna);
# 'earrings' (Tib.: rna cha) represent of [[Amitabha]] and pristine awareness of discernment (Pratyavekṣaṇa-jñāna);
# 'necklace' (Tib.: mgul rgyan) symbolizing [[Ratnasambhava]] and pristine awareness of total sameness (Samatā-jñāna);
# 'bracelets' (Tib.: lag gdu) and 'anklets' (Tib.: gdu bu) as symbolic of [[Vairochana]] and pristine awareness of the ultimate dimension of phenomena (Tathatā-jñāna);
# 'girdle' (Tib.: ske rags) symbolizing [[Amoghasiddhi]] and the accomplishing pristine awareness (Kṛty-anuṣṭhāna-jñāna);
The additional ornament spoken of in various texts related to Hevajra is ash from a cremation ground smeared on the body (Tib.: thal chen).&lt;ref name="Kongtrul 2005 p.493"/&gt;

'''''Il Verri''''' is an [[Italian language|Italian]] quarterly [[literary magazine]], which has been published since 1956. The magazine is based in [[Milan]], Italy.

==History and profile==
''Il Verri'' was started by [[Luciano Anceschi]] in Milan in 1956.&lt;ref name="gino"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gino Moliterno|title=Encyclopedia of Contemporary Italian Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WvGGAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA289|accessdate=26 November 2016|date=11 September 2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-75876-0|page=467}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pet"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Bondanella|title=Umberto Eco and the Open Text: Semiotics, Fiction, Popular Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U2vAv7e9ZQMC&amp;pg=PA21|accessdate=26 November 2016|date=3 April 1997|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-44200-8|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gae"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gaetana Marrone|author2=Paolo Puppa|title=Encyclopedia of Italian Literary Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d9NcAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA985|accessdate=26 November 2016|date=26 December 2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-45530-9|page=985}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine is published on a quarterly basis.&lt;ref name="nla"/&gt; Its headquarters is in Milan.&lt;ref name=pet/&gt;&lt;ref name="nla"&gt;{{cite web|title=Il Verri|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/18797464?selectedversion=NBD4585623|work=National Library of Australia|accessdate=26 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1973 it temporarily moved to [[Bologna]].&lt;ref name="pet"/&gt;

In the early 1960s ''Il Verri'' began to cover the writings of [[Neoavanguardia|neo avant garde]] authors, including [[Umberto Eco]], [[Edoardo Sanguineti]], [[Antonio Porta (author)|Antonio Porta]] and [[Nanni Balestrini]].&lt;ref name=gino/&gt; They were part of a literary circle called Gruppo 63.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka|title=Man within His Life-World: Contributions to Phenomenology by Scholars from East-Central Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-hYyBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT443|accessdate=26 November 2016|date=29 June 2013|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-94-009-2587-8|page=443}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine played a significant role for Umberto Eco in shaping his theories.&lt;ref name="pet"/&gt; [[Luciano Erba]] and Alfredo Giuliani were also among the contributors.&lt;ref name="pet"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gino Moliterno|title=Encyclopedia of Contemporary Italian Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WvGGAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA289|accessdate=26 November 2016|date=11 September 2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-75876-0|page=289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From its start in 1956 ''Il Verri'' has been instrumental in making some approaches familiar in Italy such as [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], [[structuralism]] and [[semiology]].&lt;ref name="gae"/&gt; The magazine also covers poems and in 1961 Luciano Anceschi collected them in a book.&lt;ref name="gae"/&gt;

In topology, a branch of mathematics, given a topological monoid ''X'' up to homotopy (in a nice way), an '''infinite loop space machine''' produces a [[group completion]] of ''X'' together with [[infinite loop space]] structure. For example, one can take ''X'' to be the [[classifying space]] of a [[symmetric monoidal category]] ''S''; that is, &lt;math&gt;X = BS&lt;/math&gt;. Then the machine produces the group completion &lt;math&gt;BS \to K(S)&lt;/math&gt;. The space &lt;math&gt;K(S)&lt;/math&gt; may be described by the [[K-theory spectrum]] of ''S''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2762">The '''International Tribunal on Crimes against Women''' was a people's tribunal which took place on March 4–8, 1976 in [[Brussels]].&lt;ref name="Doughty, Frances 1978, p148"&gt;Doughty, Frances. ''lesbians and International Women's Year: A Report on Three Conferences'', in ''Our Right to Love: A Lesbian Resource Book'', Ginny Vida, Prentice Hall, 1978, {{ISBN|0-13-644401-6}}, p148&lt;/ref&gt; The event was created with the intention to "make public the full range of crimes, both violently brutal and subtly discriminatory, committed against women of all cultures."&lt;ref name="Doughty, Frances 1978, p148"/&gt;

==History==
[[Diana E. H. Russell]] and Nicole Van Den Ven, the main organizers of the tribunal,&lt;ref name="Chesler, Phyllis 1996, p14"&gt;Chesler, Phyllis. ''Rape as a War Crime: Reaching Moral Clarity'', ''On the Issues'', May 1996, p14&lt;/ref&gt; were inspired by [[Bertrand Russell]]'s [[International War Crimes Tribunal]], a people's tribunal on crimes committed in the [[Vietnam War]].

==Content==
The ITCW  was attended by over 2000 women from 40 countries, and specific topics include medical and economic crimes, [[rape]], [[political prisoner]]s, crimes against [[lesbians]], [[spousal abuse]], [[prostitution]], [[pornography]] and [[femicide]].&lt;ref name="Doughty, Frances 1978, p148"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chesler, Phyllis 1996, p14"/&gt;

Numerous testimonies were provided in writing by women who were unable to attend the tribunal.&lt;ref name="Doughty, Frances 1978, p148"/&gt;

Attendee Frances Doughty noted that the Tribunal confirmed for her that "the oppression of women in general and of lesbians in particular is truly worldwide"&lt;ref&gt;Doughty, Frances. ''lesbians and International Women's Year: A Report on Three Conferences'', in ''Our Right to Love: A Lesbian Resource Book'', Ginny Vida, Prentice Hall, 1978, {{ISBN|0-13-644401-6}}, p149&lt;/ref&gt;

Lesbian poet [[Pat Parker]] was among the contributors of testimony, speaking about her eldest sister, who was murdered by her husband.&lt;ref name="ilene-alexander"&gt;[http://voices.cla.umn.edu/vg/Bios/entries/parker_pat.html Alexander, Ilene 1998]&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Take Back the Night (protest)|Take Back the Night]] march took place as a candlelight procession in association with the Tribunal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dso.uncc.edu/women/TBN_Web/history.html Take Back the Night History]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
Organizers Russell and Van Den Ven published a book based on the Tribunal, ''Crimes Against Women: Proceedings of the International Tribunal'' later in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dianarussell.com/publications.html#CRIMESAGAINSTWOMEN dianarussell.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3542">'''Ionic conduction''' (denoted by {{math|''&amp;lambda;''}}-lambda) is the movement of an [[ion]] from one site to another through [[Crystallographic defect|defect]]s in the [[Crystal structure|crystal lattice]] of a solid or aqueous solution.

Ionic conduction is one mechanism of [[current (electricity)|current]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Turton. (2000).The Physics of Solids. New York:: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-850352-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In solids, ions typically occupy fixed positions in the crystal lattice and do not move. However, ionic conduction can occur, especially as the temperature increases &lt;ref&gt;http://www.teknik.uu.se/ftf/education/Disordered_materials/Ion_conduction.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Ionic conduction in solids has been a subject of interest since the beginning of the 19th century. [[Michael Faraday]] established in 1839 that the laws of [[electrolysis]] are also obeyed in ionic solids like [[lead(II) fluoride]] ({{chemical formula|Pb||F|2}}) and [[silver sulfide]] ({{chemical formula|Ag|2|S}}).

==Silver iodide==
{{confusing|section|date=October 2007|reason=Some of the text makes no sense (e.g. "nothing less than the melting") and lacks sufficient explanation}}
{{technical|section|date=October 2010}}
In 1921, Tubandt et al. found that solid [[silver iodide]] ({{chemical formula|Ag||I}}) had extraordinary high ionic conductivity. At temperatures above 147&amp;nbsp;°C, AgI changes into a phase that has an ionic conductivity of &lt;!--number and units needs fixing--&gt;~ 1 –1&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, similar to that of its [[liquid phase]]. This high temperature phase of AgI was the first [[superionic conductor]] ever discovered. The highly conductive phase of AgI is now known as alpha-AgI. It was shown that a sub[[crystal structure|lattice]] [[cations|cationic]] disorder takes place in alpha-AgI. The liquid-like state of Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions, as proposed by Strock (1934, 1936) and later reinforced by others (Geller, 1977; Funke, 1976), consists of a cubic [[crystal structure#Unit cell|unit cell]] of iodide ions (I&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;), in which a total of 42 sites (6 [[octahedral]], 12 [[tetragonal]] and 24 [[trigonal bipyramid]]al) are available for 2 Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions, as shown in the Figure 1. O' Keeffe and Hyde (1976) have argued that this [[phase transition]] in AgI is dramatic and powerful, nothing less than the melting and have also shown that the [[entropy]] change at the super-ionic transition is comparable to its value at the melting. Thus, in the -phase, I&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ions form a [[cubic crystal system|body-centered cubic]] lattice and the Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions are distributed in such a way that 42 [[crystallography|crystallographic]] equivalent [[:wikt:interstice|interstice]]s are available for the two Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions.

[[Alpha phase]] crystals of various materials like {{chemical formula|Ag|2|s}}, {{chemical formula|Ag|2|se}}, {{chemical formula|Ag|2|Te}}, etc. were soon discovered (Tubandt, 1932). By the early 1930s, it was demonstrated that these [[fast ion conductor|fast ionically conducting]] solids could be treated entirely the same as [[aqueous]] [[electrolyte]]s from the viewpoint of [[chemical reaction]]s and [[thermodynamics]], hence these materials were labeled ''solid electrolytes''.

[[File:Japanese River Otter Skelton.jpg|260px|right|thumb|Skeleton of Japanese river otter. Exhibit in the [[National Museum of Nature and Science]], [[Tokyo]]]]
The {{nihongo|'''Japanese river otter''' (''Lutra lutra whiteleyi'')|日本川獺|Nihon-kawauso&lt;ref&gt;''Kenkyusha's New Japanese-English Dictionary'', Kenkyusha Limited, Tokyo 1991, {{ISBN|4-7674-2015-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} is an extinct variety of [[otter]] formerly widespread in Japan. Dating back to the 1880s, it was even seen in [[Tokyo]]. The population suddenly shrank in the 1930s, and the mammal nearly vanished. Since then, it has only been spotted several times, in 1964 in the [[Seto Inland Sea]], and in the Uwa Sea in 1972 and 1973. The last official sighting was in the southern part of [[Kōchi Prefecture]] in 1979, when it was photographed in the mouth of the Shinjo River in [[Susaki, Kōchi|Susaki]]. It was subsequently classified as a "Critically Endangered" species on the Japanese Red List.&lt;ref name="redlist"&gt;{{cite web | title=Red List of Threatened Mammals of Japan | url=http://www.biodic.go.jp/english/rdb/red_mammals.txt | publisher=Ministry of the Environment | accessdate=August 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 28, 2012, the Japanese river otter was officially declared extinct by the Ministry of the Environment.&lt;ref name="mainichi20120828"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20120828p2a00m0na016000c.html |title=Japanese river otter declared extinct |date=August 28, 2012 |work=Mainichi jp |publisher=The Mainichi Newspapers |location=Japan |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120901105043/http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20120828p2a00m0na016000c.html |archivedate=September 1, 2012 |accessdate=August 28, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Kyodo News]], "[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20120829a6.html Japanese river otter declared extinct]", ''[[The Japan Times]]'', August 29, 2012, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; It is the official animal symbol of [[Ehime Prefecture]].&lt;ref name=facts/&gt; In February 2017, a wild otter was caught on camera on [[Tsushima Island]], [[Nagasaki Prefecture]]. However, it is not known whether the observed otter was a Japanese river otter.&lt;ref&gt;[https://jen.jiji.com/jc/eng?g=eco&amp;k=2017081700680 Jiji.com].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taxonomy==
Several genetic studies have suggested that the Japanese river otter should be treated as a distinct species ''Lutra nippon'' rather than a subspecies of ''Lutra lutra''.&lt;ref name="Suzuki et al. 1996"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Suzuki |first1=Tomohiko |last2=Yuasa |first2=Hajime |last3=Machida |first3=Yoshihiko |year=1996 |title=Phylogenetic position of the Japanese river otter ''Lutra nippon'' inferred from the nucleotide sequence of 224 bp of the mitochondrial cytochrome ''b'' gene |journal=Zoological Science |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=621-626 |doi=10.2108/zsj.13.621 |url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/10.2108/zsj.13.621}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this reclassification is not yet generally accepted in the absence of further verification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|last1=Yamamoto|first1=K.|last2=Ando|first2=M.|year=2011|title=Trends in otter-related newspaper articles in Japan over 135 years|publisher=IUCN Otter Specialist|series=Group Bulletin|volume=28|pages=31-34|url=http://www.iucnosg.org/Bulletin/Volume28B/Yamamoto_Ando_2011.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
Fully grown, a Japanese otter was between {{convert|65|and|80|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} long, with a tail measuring {{convert|45|to|50|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}}. It had a thick, lush coat of dark brown fur with short webbed feet. In addition the river otter has two types/sets of fur. Data has shown that the river otter would shed their under fur fully from May to August. After the shedding of the under fur, the otter shed their guard hair from August to November. This allowed them to adjust to the seasons changing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1 = Blundell | first1 = Gail M. | last2 = Ben-David | first2 = Merav | last3 = Bowyer | first3 = R. Terry | year = 2002 | title = Sociality in river otters: cooperative foraging or reproductive strategies? | url = | journal = Behavioral Ecology | volume = 13 | issue = 1| pages = 134–141 | doi = 10.1093/beheco/13.1.134}}&lt;/ref&gt; The otter had a lifespan of up to 25 years.&lt;ref name=facts/&gt;

== Habits ==
A nocturnal creature, an otter only left its den after dark to forage for food. Claiming a territory about ten miles in diameter, it marked the area with its droppings about one to three miles apart and sets up three or four nests under rocks or inside bushes. The otters were always on the move, visiting each den only once every three to four days. They were considered an adult after only one year. They would then venture on their own, but continue in solitude unless ready to mate.&lt;ref name="Extinct Otters"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mueller|first1=Jennifer|title=Extinct Otters|url=http://animals.pawnation.com/extinct-otters-6758.html|website=PawNation|publisher=Demand Media|accessdate=October 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reproduction==
In general, the Japanese River Otter was ready to reproduce when they were two to three years old. In addition, the males sought out the females in the reproduction process. Besides during reproduction and with the exception of young males staying with their mother for a range of two to three years until they were mature, female otters and male otters didn't generally live together. When a male otter calls out to a female otter, she must give him permission for the mating. If she does not, the male would move onto the next female otter. For the male to know that the female is interested in mating, the female will roll around with the male, which releases hormones. The Japanese River Otter could have anywhere from one to six offspring per litter. Once born, the baby otters are completely blind for a month, leaving them utterly helpless. The female otter makes for a great mother; nursing her young for up to eight hours a day, as well as teaching them valuable lessons and protecting them. After the pups are around the age of four months, the mother otter will introduce her youth to solid food and start to teach them how to hunt.&lt;ref&gt;"Otter Reproduction." Otter Facts and Information. BioExpedition.com, n.d. Web. 24 Oct. 2014. &lt;http://www.otter-world.com/otter-reproduction/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diet ==
Like most otters, the Japanese river otter was not an especially picky eater. While it primarily fed on fish, crab, and shrimp; it also ate eels, beetles, watermelons, and sweet potatoes. Many of these Japanese otters eat about 15% to 25% of their own body weight. Many otters spend around six hours to find food because of their difficult living space and their competition for food. The Japanese otter was known as one of the top carnivores in the aquatic food chain.

== Cause of extinction ==
In the past, there were thousands of river otters in Japan. Starting in the Meiji period, the government of Japan adopted a policy of increasing wealth and military prowess. Animal pelts thus became very valuable since they could be exported for money. As a result, Japanese river otters started to be hunted throughout the country. Their numbers soon dwindled. Populations made a slight comeback after the creation of hunting regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Motokazu|first1=Ando|title=Lake Biwa: Interactions between Nature and People|date=2012|publisher=Springer Dordrecht Heidelberg|location=New York|isbn=978-94-007-1782-4|pages=141–142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, pollution and human development then harmed their environment and resources to build their habitats. This pollution terminated their food sources in the rivers, causing them to hunt in more dangerous settings.&lt;ref name="Extinct Otters"/&gt; These causes grew rapidly, resulting in the extinction of the Japanese river otter in the late 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Epstein|first1=Mike|title=Japanese River Otter Declared Extinct After Three Decades|url=http://www.themarysue.com/japanese-otter-extinct/|website=The Mary Sue|publisher=The Mary Sue|accessdate=October 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Efforts to prove its existence ==
Throughout the 1990s, there were several attempts to locate a surviving Japanese river otter.

In December 1991, the [[Ministry of the Environment (Japan)|Environmental Agency of Japan]] in partnership with the Kochi prefectural government assembled a research team of experts and began their search. In March 1992, the research group found hair and excrement in Kochi Prefecture and believed to have come from an otter. Also found were three footprints, and ten additional excrement samples. After an analysis of a cross-section of the hair, the researchers determined that it came from an otter. An official from the agency's wildlife protection section stated that the hair was "scientifically solid evidence that confirms the existence of the Japanese Otter."

In 1994, zoological experts visited the area where the excrement was found. They discovered remains of the animal's urine, which the animal is believed to leave during its courtship. The prefectural government of Kochi set up an infrared camera for six months from October 1994 to April 1995 in an effort to capture it on film, but all that was recorded were animals such as [[raccoon dog]]s.

Between March 4 and 9, 1996, a group of zoo officials, municipal government officials and animals lovers from across the country searched for the river otter in the areas where finds have been made in the past. Such areas included coastal areas in Susaki, areas along the Niyodo River running through Sakawacho and Inocho, and coastal areas along [[Shimanto River]]. No evidence of the animal's existence was found.

Among these, the presumed sighting reported in Kochi by a local artist with a detailed sketch was regarded "highly trustable" by Yoshihiko Machida, an emeritus professor at the [[Kōchi University]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Mainichi Shimbun]]. 2017. [https://mainichi.jp/articles/20170329/k00/00e/040/212000c ニホンカワウソ　２００９年に目撃情報]. Retrieved on April 12, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Machida also pointed that the previous studies by the prefecture had been restricted only among coastal areas and thus not filling the definition of extinct species by [[IUCN]]. Regarding this, a survey was conducted by [[Ehime Prefecture]] in 2014, noting several recent sightings.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ehime Prefecture]].

In February 2017, a wild otter was filmed alive on [[Tsushima Island]] in [[Nagasaki Prefecture]], Japan. However, it is not known whether the observed otter was a Japanese river otter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wild otter filmed alive in first Japan sighting since 1979|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2017/08/17/national/wild-otter-thought-extinct-filmed-alive-first-japan-sighting-since-1979/|website=The Japan Times Online|accessdate=17 August 2017|date=17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Genetic studies ==
Research done in the early 1990s by the Department of Biology of Kochi University in Japan revealed some interesting facts about the genes of the Japanese River Otter. For many years, it was thought that the Japanese river otter was a subspecies of the Eurasian otter ''Lutra lutra''. However, the studies done in Kochi University revealed something different. By comparing the Mitochondrial Cytochrome b Gene of a mummified Japanese river otter corpse with Eurasian otters from Latvia and China, it was proven that the Japanese river otter was actually different, and was therefore not a subspecies. The name for the Japanese river otter was then changed from ''L. l. whiteleyi'' to ''Lutra nippon''.&lt;ref name="Suzuki et al. 1996"/&gt;

==Other uses==
The Japanese river otter was used as medicine to help cure [[tuberculosis]]. Typically a dosage that would last about forty days would cost roughly three hundred US dollars.&lt;ref name="motokazu"&gt;{{cite web|last=Motokazu|first=Ando|title=Extinction of Japanese River Otter|url=http://www.otterspecialistgroup.org/Library/Colloquium_10/Presentations/10-11-10-40_Ando.pdf|accessdate=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Beginning in the early 20th century, the otter pelts were used for military purposes as well. In 1929, the government established the "Hunters Association" which called upon people to hunt and skin these otters, which was one of the main causes of their eventual extinction.&lt;ref name="motokazu"/&gt;

==In culture==
The Japanese river otter was named the official animal symbol of Japan's [[Ehime Prefecture]], a region of Japan in northwestern [[Shikoku]].&lt;ref name=facts&gt;{{cite web|title=Japanese River Otter Facts|url=http://extinct-animals-facts.com/Recently-Extinct-Animal-Facts/Extinct-Japanese-River-Otter-Facts.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kammapatha''', in [[Buddhism]], refers to the ten wholesome and unwholesome courses of action ([[Karma in Buddhism|karma]]).

Among the ten in the two sets, three are bodily, four are verbal, and three are mental. The ten courses of unwholesome kamma may be listed as follows, divided by way of their doors of expression: 

# Destroying life
# Taking what is not given
# Wrong conduct in regard to sense pleasures
# False speech
# Slanderous speech
# Harsh speech
# Idle chatter
# Covetousness
# Ill will
# Wrong view

The ten courses of wholesome kamma are the opposites of these: abstaining from the first seven courses of unwholesome kamma, being free from covetousness and ill will, and holding right view. Though the seven cases of abstinence are exercised entirely by the mind and do not necessarily entail overt action, they are still designated wholesome bodily and verbal action because they center on the control of the faculties of body and speech. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/waytoend.html The Noble Eightfold Path by Bhikkhu Bodhi]&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Language speaks'''" (in the original [[German language|German]] ''Die Sprache spricht''), is a famous saying by [[Martin Heidegger]]. Heidegger first formulated it in his 1950 lecture "Language" (''Die Sprache''),&lt;ref name="Lyon06"&gt;Lyon (2006) pp.128-9&lt;/ref&gt; and frequently repeated it in later works.&lt;ref name="Philipse98"&gt;Philipse (1998) p.205&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Theodor W. Adorno|Adorno]] expressed a related idea when he said that language "acquires a voice" and "speaks itself."&lt;ref&gt;Carsten Strathausen (2003) The look of things: poetry and vision around 1900, Volume 8, Issue 126, p.148-51&lt;/ref&gt;

==The "Language" lecture==
The saying was first formulated by Heidegger in the lecture ''Language" ("Die Sprache") in memory of [[Max Kommerell]], first delivered on October 7, 1950 at the [[Bühlerhöhe]] building.&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger (1959) ''Unterwegs zur Sprache'', references section, p.259, quote:{{quotation|Vortrag vom 7. Oktober 1950 auf Bühlerhöhe zum Gedächtnis von Max Kommerell und am 14. Februar 1951 bei der Württembergischen Bibliotheksgesellschaft in Stuttgart wiederholt.}} translation by [[Albert Hofstadter]] in Heidegger (1971), p.xxv, quote: 
{{quotation|"Language" &lt;br&gt;
"Die Sprache," in ''Unterwegs zur Sprache'' (Pfullingen: Neske, 1959). In this volume's references Heidegger writes: "The lecture was given on October 7, 1950, at Bühlerhöhe in memory of Max Kommerell and was repeated on February 14, 1951, at the Württembergischen Bibliotheksgesellschaft in Stuggart. The lecture, hitherto unpublished, has become known in the form of many transcripts and notes."}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lecture was translated in English by [[Albert Hofstadter]] in the 1971 Heidegger collection ''Poetry, Language, Thought''.&lt;ref&gt;"Language", in Heidegger (1971) pp.187-ff&lt;/ref&gt;

Quoting a [[Johann Georg Hamann|Hamann]]'s 1784 letter to [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]], Heidegger talks of language as an "[[Abyss (religion)|abyss]]."

The so-called '''Latvian Operation''' ({{lang-ru|Латышская операция}}) '''of the People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs''' ([[NKVD]]) was a mass arrest and execution of persons of [[Latvians|Latvian]] origin in the [[Soviet Union]] during the period of [[Great Purge]] (1937–1938).

==Latvians in the Soviet Union until 1936==
More than 500 Latvian peasant colonies originated from the 19th century after the [[Emancipation reform of 1861|abolition of serfdom]] near [[St. Petersburg]], [[Novgorod]] and in [[Siberia]]. As the front line of Courland was approaching in the [[First World War]], extensive forced evacuations were carried out, so that the number of Latvians living in Russia doubled to up to 500,000 people. Many of the [[Latvian Riflemen]] were the early supporters of the [[Bolsheviks]] in 1917. With the end of the World War and the [[Russian Civil War]], many of the refugees were able to return to an independent Latvia. The Riga peace treaty explicitly foresaw the departure of former Latvian riflemen and refugees. According to the 1926 census, about 150,000 Latvians lived in the Soviet Union. They cultivated a lively [[Latvian culture|cultural life]] with the schools, newspapers and theaters. Since the [[1905 Russian Revolution|1905 Revolution]], there has been a strong Latvian faction in the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]]. Persons of Latvian descent temporarily held the high positions in the State apparatus of Soviet Russia. Of 70 Commissioners of the [[Cheka]] were in the year 1918 38 were of Latvian origin. However, with the increasing Russification of the State organs, members of non-Russian minorities were largely ousted from the management positions. In the party leadership of Josef Stalin, Latvia was regarded as a so-called "enemy nation" and Latvians were generally regarded as counter-revolutionary and suspicious. The resistance of peasant colonists to the forced collectivization at the end of the 1920s seemed to confirm to this image. Through targeted deportations in the [[Gulag]], these colonies were eliminated by 1933. From this time, a rigorous "purge" of the party and state apparatus of non-Russians took place. The [[Latvian Communist Party]] was dissolved in 1936, its members persecuted and murdered as "nationalists" and "people's enemies". One aspect of Stalin's [[Great Purge]] was state-directed xenophobia. In July 1937 the closure of the publishing house and cultural association "Prometejs" and the arrest of its employees took place. The Red Latvian Riflemen were removed from the history and school books and their veteran associations were dissolved.

==The operation==
On November 23, 1937, [[Nikolai Yezhov]] ordered the [[NKVD]] services to pool all the information gathered about Latvians in cultural and political life, the military and other institutions to be able to arrest them "just as during the Polish operation". On 30 November, the Order No. 49990 was the mass arrest of ethnic Latvians throughout the Soviet Union. The lawsuits were streamlined by forms with pre-printed accusations and confessions, which then condemned judicial victims to criminal work or shooting. Through torture, the NKVD constructed the existence of a Latvian espionage circle, which allegedly belonged to all Latvian officials from the [[Politburo]] to the school directors. The last Latvian Chekists were now also executed by their colleagues. Due to the large number of detainees, despite the so-called album proceedings, the courts were unable to impose convictions quickly enough. Therefore, the finish date of the action was extended until August 1938. In October 1938, special Troikas were then set up to work out the backlog of unedited cases. When the successor of Yezhov, [[Lavrenty Beria]] issued the command No. 00762 on November 26, 1938, the Latvian operation ended with the conclusion of the Great Purge. The liquidation of the Latvian party officials gave the Soviet authorities certain difficulties in establishing a party and administrative apparatus in the [[Soviet occupation of Latvia in 1940|occupation of Latvia 1940]].

==Deaths resulting from the operation==
In particular, 22,369 convictions of Latvians were known, of which 16,573 or 74% were shot. Various estimates are based on 73,000 Latvian casualties. Exact victim numbers are also not available because many other people were murdered under the pretext of "Latvians". Women who were sent to the gulag because of a marriage with the ethnic enemies and their children who came to orphanages were not included in the statistics. The operation led to the abandonment of their own culture among the remaining Latvians, so descendants of Latvian colonists barely speak [[Latvian language|Latvian]] today. A rehabilitation of the victims took place under [[Nikita Khrushchev|Khrushchev]]. Information about the specific death and date could only be obtained after the end of the communist rule after 1990. The perpetrators and performers of the action, often known by name, have never been held accountable. Larger groups of victims were shot at the practice places [[Butovo firing range|Butovo]] and [[Kommunarka]] near [[Moscow]], [[Levaschovo]] near [[Leningrad]] or [[Kurapaty]] near [[Minsk]]. However, the tortures and murders were carried out throughout the territory of the State.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3883">'''Lexical entrainment''' is the phenomenon in conversational [[linguistics]] of the process of the subject adopting the reference terms of their interlocutor. In practice, it acts as a mechanism of the [[cooperative principle]] in which both parties to the conversation employ lexical entrainment as a progressive system to develop "conceptual pacts"&lt;ref name=sbrennan96&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brennan|first=Susan|title=Lexical entrainment in spontaneous dialog|journal=Proceedings, 1996 International Symposium on Spoken Dialogue|year=1996|issue=ISSD-96|pages=41–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; (a working temporary conversational terminology) to ensure maximum clarity of reference in the communication between the parties; this process is necessary to overcome the ambiguity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deutsch|first=Werner|author2=Pechmann, Thomas |title=Social interaction and the development of definite descriptions|journal=Cognition|year=1982|volume=11|pages=159–184|doi=10.1016/0010-0277(82)90024-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  inherent in the multitude of synonyms that exist in language. 

Lexical entrainment arises by two cooperative mechanisms:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Garrod|first=Simon|author2=Anderson, Anthony |title=Saying what you mean in dialogue: A study in conceptual and semantic co-ordination|journal=Cognition|year=1987|volume=27|pages=181–218|doi=10.1016/0010-0277(87)90018-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Embedded corrections – a reference to the object implied by the context of the sentence, but with no explicit reference to the change in terminology
* Exposed corrections – an explicit reference to the change in terminology, possibly including a request to assign the referent a common term (e.g., "by 'girl', do you mean 'Jane'?")

==Violation of Grice's maxim of quantity==
Once lexical entrainment has come to determine the phrasing for a referent, both parties will use that terminology for the referent for the duration, even if it proceeds to violate the [[Gricean maxim]] of quantity. For example, if one wants to refer to a brown loafer out of a set of shoes that consist of: the loafer, a sneaker, and a high-heeled shoe, they will not use ''the shoe'' to describe the object as this phrasing does not unambiguously describe one item in the set under consideration. They will also not call the object ''the brown loafer'' which would violate Grice's maxim of quantity. The speaker will settle on using the term ''the loafer'' as it is just informative enough without giving too much information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brennan|first=Susan|author2=Clark, Herbert H. |title=Conceptual Pacts and Lexical Choice in Conversation|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition|year=1996|volume=22|issue=6|pages=1482–1493|doi=10.1037/0278-7393.22.6.1482}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another important factor is lexical availability; the ease of conceptualizing a referent in a certain way and then retrieving and producing a label for it. For many objects the most available labels are basic nouns; for example, the word "dog". Instead of saying ''animal'' or ''husky'' for the referent, most subjects will default to ''dog''.
If in a set of objects one is to refer to either a husky, a table, and a poster, people are still most likely to use the word "dog." This is technically a violation of Grice's maxim of quantity, as using the term ''animal'' is ideal.

==Applications==
Lexical entrainment has applications in [[natural language processing]] in computers as well as human–human interaction. Currently, the adaptability of computers to modify their referencing to the terms of their human interlocutor is limited, so the entrainment adaptation falls to the human operator; this phenomenon is readily demonstrated in Brennan's 1996 experiment.&lt;ref name=sbrennan96 /&gt;

'''''Life Is a Dream''''' ({{lang-es|link=no|La vida es sueño}} {{IPA-es|la ˈβiða es ˈsweɲo|}}) is a [[Spanish-language]] play by [[Pedro Calderón de la Barca]]. First published in 1635 (or possibly in early 1636) during the Spanish Baroque period (NADV1),&lt;ref&gt;[http://barca.classicauthors.net/WonderWorkingMagician/  Introduction to Pedro Calderon De La Barca's, "The Wonder-Working Magician" on barca.classicauthors.net] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090710014608/http://barca.classicauthors.net/WonderWorkingMagician/ |date=10 July 2009 }} Retrieved 23 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; it is a philosophical allegory regarding the human situation and the mystery of life.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett &amp; Hildy, p.145&lt;/ref&gt; The play has been described as "the supreme example of [[Spanish Golden Age theatre|Spanish Golden Age drama]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Racz | first=Gregary | year=2006 | title=Pedro Calderón de la Barca: Life Is a Dream | publisher=Penguin | isbn=978-0-14-310482-7|page= viii}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story focuses on the fictional Segismundo, Prince of Poland, who has been imprisoned in a tower by his father, King Basilio, following a dire prophecy that the prince would bring disaster to the country and death to the King.  Basilio briefly frees Segismundo, but when the prince goes on a rampage, the king imprisons him again, persuading him that it was all a dream.

The play's central themes are the conflict between [[free will]] and [[Destiny|fate]], as well as restoring one's honor (NADV1). It remains one of Calderón's best-known and most studied works.  Other themes include dreams vs. reality and the conflict between father and son.  The play has been adapted for other stage works, in film and as a novel.

[[File:Lope de vega 02.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Title page of a comedy by Spanish playwright [[Lope de Vega]]]]
[[Spanish Empire|Catholic Spain]] was the most powerful European nation by the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Cowans, Jon (ed). ''Early Modern Spain: A Documentary History'', University of Pennsylvania Press (2003), p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Spanish Armada]] was defeated by England in 1588, however, while Spain was trying to defend the northern coast of Africa from the expansion of the Turkish [[Ottoman Empire]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Drama for students [Volume 23]: presenting analysis, context and criticism on commonly studied dramas|year=2006| location=Detroit| isbn=978-0-7876-8119-7| url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?action=interpret&amp;id=GALE%7C5FCO&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=cuny_main&amp;it=aboutBook&amp;p=GVRL&amp;sw=w&amp;authCount=1| editor=Sara Constantakis|format=Collection}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the gold and silver that Spain took from its possessions in the [[New World]] were not adequate to sustain its subsequent decades of heavy military expenses. Spain's power was rapidly waning by the time Calderón wrote ''Life Is a Dream''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kidd|first=Michael| title=Critical Introduction to Pedro Calderon de la Barca's Life's a Dream| year=2004| publisher=University Press of Colorado|location=Boulder, Colorado| pages=1–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Payne, "Spanish Society and Economics in the Imperial Age" (Ch. 14)&lt;/ref&gt;

The age of Calderón was also marked by deep religious conviction in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kidd| first=Michael| title=Critical Introduction to Pedro Calderon de la Barca's Life's a Dream|year=2004| publisher=University Press of Colorado|location=Boulder, Colorado|pages=1–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Catholic church had fostered Spanish pride and identity, to the extent that "speaking Christian" became, and remains, synonymous with speaking Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kidd|first=Michael| title=Critical Introduction to Pedro Calderon de la Barca's Life's a Dream|year=2004| publisher=University Press of Colorado| location=Boulder, Colorado|pages=1–15}} This religious fervor permeated the theatre of the time in that a prevalent theme was free will versus predestination.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another current that permeated Spanish thinking was the radical departure from the medieval ideal that royal power resided in God's will, as noted in [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavelli's]] ''[[The Prince]]'' (1532). [[Francisco Suárez|Francisco Suarez’s]] treatise ''On the Defense of Faith'' (''De defensio fidei'', 1613) stated that political power resided in the people and rejected the divine rights of kings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Suarez| first=Francisco| title=DEFENSA DE LA FE (DEFENSIO FIDEI)|year=1971|publisher=Instituto de Estudios Politicos de Madrid| location=Madrid}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Juan Mariana]]'s ''On Kings and Kingship'' (1599) went even further by stating that the people had the right to murder despotic kings.&lt;ref&gt;Mariana, Jaun. ''On Kings and Kingship'' (1599)&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2014}}

Amidst these developments during the 16th and 17th centuries, Spain experienced a cultural blossoming referred to as the [[Spanish Golden Age]].&lt;ref&gt;Brockett &amp; Hildy, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Payne, Stanley G.

It saw the birth of notable works of art: ''[[Don Quixote]]'', by [[Miguel de Cervantes]] (1605), played with the vague line between reality and perception.&lt;ref&gt;Constantakis, p.186&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lope de Vega]], in his play ''[[Fuente Ovejuna]]'' (1619), talks about a village that rebels against authority. 
==Synopsis==

===Act I===
[[File:La vida es sueño, en el 35 Festival Internacional del Teatro Clásico (16).jpg|thumb|''La vida es sueño'', 35th Festival Internacional del Teatro Clásico, [[Almagro, Ciudad Real|Almagro]] (2012)]]
Rosaura walks through the mountains of Poland, dressed as a man. She finds Clarín, a jester, who tries to make her forget how miserably Poland receives visitors. They arrive at a tower, where they find Segismundo imprisoned, bound in chains. He tells them that his only crime was being born. Clotaldo, Segismundo's old warden and tutor, arrives and orders his guards to disarm and kill the intruders, but he recognizes Rosaura's sword as his own that he had left behind in [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Muskovy]] (for a favor that he owed) years ago for his child to bear. Suspecting that Rosaura is his child (he thinks she is male), he takes Rosaura and Clarín with him to court. Fife also appears in this play, who is Rosaura's friend.

[[File:Royal Castle in Warsaw during the reign of John Sobieski.jpg|left|thumb|The royal palace in medieval Poland]]
At the palace, Astolfo, Duke of Muscovy, discusses with his cousin, Princess Estrella (Segismundo's cousin), that as they are the nephew and niece of King Basilio of Poland, they would be his successors if they married each other. Estrella is troubled by the locket that Astolfo wears, with another woman's portrait. Basilio reveals to them that he imprisoned his infant son, Segismundo, due to a prophecy by an oracle that the prince would bring disgrace to Poland and would kill his father, but he wants to grant his son a chance to prove the oracle wrong. If he finds him evil and unworthy, he will send him back to his cell, making way for Astolfo and Estrella to become the new king and queen. Clotaldo enters with Rosaura, telling Basilio that the intruders know about Segismundo. He begs for the king's pardon, as he knows he should have killed them. The king says he should not worry, for his secret has already been revealed. Rosaura tells Clotaldo that she wants revenge against Astolfo, but she won't say why. Clotaldo is reluctant to reveal that he thinks he is Rosaura's father.

===Act II===
Clotaldo gives Segismundo a sedative that "robs one in his sleep of his sense and faculties" (109), which puts him in a sleep similar to death. In the Royal Palace of the capital city of Warsaw, Clotaldo has learned that Rosaura is a woman; Clarín explains that Rosaura is Princess Estrella's maid but has been going by the name of Astrea. When Segismundo is awakened and arrives at court, Clotaldo tells him that he is the prince of Poland and heir to the throne. He resents Clotaldo for keeping this secret from him for all those years. He finds Duke Astolfo irritating and is dazzled by Estrella's beauty.  When a servant warns him about the princess's betrothal to Astolfo, Segismundo is enraged by the news and throws the servant from the balcony.

The king demands an explanation from his son. He tries to reason with him, but Segismundo announces he will fight everyone, for his rights were denied him for a long time. Basilio warns him that he must behave, or he might find out he's dreaming. Segismundo interrupts a conversation between Rosaura and Clarín. Rosaura wants to leave, but Segismundo tries to seduce her. Clotaldo steps up to defend his child, but Segismundo pulls out a dagger threatening to kill him. As Clotaldo begs for his life, Astolfo challenges Segismundo to a duel. Before they proceed, the king sedates the prince again and sends him back to his cell.

The king dreams he is a king,
And in this delusive way
Lives and rules with sovereign sway;
All the cheers that round him ring,
Born of air, on air take wing.
And in ashes (mournful fate!)
Death dissolves his pride and state:
Who would wish a crown to take,
Seeing that he must awake
In the dream beyond death's gate?

....

'Tis a dream that I in sadness
Here am bound, the scorn of fate;
'Twas a dream that once a state
I enjoyed of light and gladness.
What is life? 'Tis but a madness.
What is life? A thing that seems,
A mirage that falsely gleams,
Phantom joy, delusive rest,
Since is life a dream at best,
And even dreams themselves are dreams.&lt;ref&gt;Translation by Denis Florence Mac-Carthy in ''Calderon's Dramas'', pp. 78-79. London: Henry S. King &amp; Co., 1873&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Listen|filename=Segismundo.ogg|title=Segismundo's soliloquy (in Spanish)|format=[[Ogg]]}}
After recriminating Astolfo for wearing another woman's portrait around his neck, Estrella commands Rosaura (still going by Astrea) to fetch this locket for her. When she approaches Astolfo for the locket, he says he recognized her as Rosaura and refuses to give her the locket, because the portrait inside is hers. Estrella walks in and demands to see it immediately, but, afraid of being discovered, Rosaura says the locket in Astolfo's hand is actually her own, and that he has hidden the one she was sent to fetch. Estrella leaves furious. Meanwhile, Clotaldo sends Clarín to prison, believing that Clarín knows his secret.

Segismundo mutters in his sleep about murder and revenge. When the prince wakes up, he tells Clotaldo about his "dream". Clotaldo tells him that even in dreams, people must act with kindness and justice. When he leaves, Segismundo is left reflecting on dreams and life.

===Act III===
The people find out that they have a prince and many rebel, breaking him out of his prison tower, although at first they comically mistake Clarin for the prince. Segismundo finds Clotaldo, who is afraid of his reaction. Segismundo forgives him, asking to join his cause, but Clotaldo refuses, swearing allegiance to the king. Back in the palace, everyone prepares for battle, and Clotaldo speaks with Rosaura. She asks him to take Astolfo's life, as he had taken her honor before leaving her. Clotaldo refuses, reminding her that Duke Astolfo is now the heir to the throne. When Rosaura asks what will be of her honor, Clotaldo suggests that she spend her days in a nunnery. Disheartened, Rosaura runs away.

As war nears, Segismundo sees Rosaura, who tells him that she was the youth who found him in his prison and also the woman who he tried to seduce in court. She tells him that she was born in Muscovy of a noble woman who was disgraced and abandoned. She had the same fate, falling in love with Astolfo and giving him her honor before he abandoned her to marry Estrella. She followed him to Poland for revenge, finding that Clotaldo is her father, but he is unwilling to fight for her honor. Rosaura compares herself to female warriors Athena and Diana. She wants to join Segismundo's battle and to kill Astolfo or to die fighting. Segismundo agrees. While soldiers cheer for Segismundo, Rosaura and Clarín are reunited, and the king's soldiers approach.

Segismundo's army is winning the battle. Basilio, Clotaldo and Astolfo are preparing to escape when Clarín is killed in front of them. Segismundo arrives and Basilio faces his son, waiting for his death, but Segismundo spares his life. In light of the Prince's generous attitude, the King proclaims Segismundo heir to his throne. As King, Segismundo decides that Astolfo must keep his promise to marry Rosaura to preserve her honor. At first Astolfo is hesitant because she is not of noble birth, but when Clotaldo reveals that she is his daughter, Astolfo consents. Segismundo then claims Estrella in marriage himself. Segismundo resolves to live by the motto that "God is God", acknowledging that, whether asleep or awake, one must strive for goodness.

==Themes and motifs==
[[File:Pedro Calderón de la Barca 01.jpg|thumb|upright|Calderón]]
;Dreams vs. reality
The concept of life as a dream is an ancient one found in Hinduism and Greek philosophy (notably Heraclitus and the famous Platonic [[Allegory of the Cave]]), and is directly related to [[René Descartes|Descartes]]' [[dream argument]]. It has been explored by writers from [[Lope de Vega]] to Shakespeare.&lt;ref&gt;[http://barca.classicauthors.net/WonderWorkingMagician/ De La Barca, Pedro Calderón. Introduction to "The Wonder-Working Magician"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090710014608/http://barca.classicauthors.net/WonderWorkingMagician/ |date=10 July 2009 }}, barca.classicauthors.net. Retrieved 8 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Key elements from the play may be derived from the Christian legend of [[Barlaam and Josaphat]], which Lope de Vega had brought to the stage.&lt;ref name=GarciaReidy&gt;{{cite web|last=Garcia Reidy|first=Alejandro|title=Las posibilidades dramaticas de Barlaam y Josafat: De Lope de Vega a sus epigonos |url=https://www.academia.edu/825478/Las_posibilidades_dramaticas_de_la_historia_de_Barlaam_y_Josafat_de_Lope_de_Vega_a_sus_epigonos|publisher=Universidad de Santiago de Compostela|accessdate=9 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This legend is, itself, a derivation of the story of the early years of [[Siddharta Gautama]], which serves as the basis for the film ''[[Little Buddha]]'' that illustrates the [[maya (Hinduism)|Hindu-Buddhist concept of reality as illusion]].&lt;ref name=GarciaReidy/&gt; 

;Father vs. son conflict
One of the major conflicts of the play is the opposition between king and prince, which parallels with the struggle of Uranus vs. Saturn or Saturn vs. Jupiter in classical mythology.&lt;ref&gt;De Armas, Frederick A. "The Critical Tower", ''The Prince in the Tower: Perceptions of La vida es sueño'', pp. 3–14, Lewisburg: Bucknell University Press, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; This struggle is a typical representation of the opposition in baroque comedy between the values represented by a fatherly figure and those embodied by the son.&lt;ref name=GarciaReidy/&gt; An opposition which, in this case, may have biographical elements.&lt;ref&gt;Parker, Alexander A. "The Father-Son Conflict in the Drama of Calderón", ''Forum for Modern language Studies'', 2 (1966), pp. 99–113&lt;/ref&gt;

;Honor
The theme of honor is major to the character Rosaura. She feels she has been stripped of her honor, and her aim is to reclaim it. She feels that both her and her mother were subjected to the same fate. She pleads to Clotaldo about earning her honor back, which he denies and sends her to a nunnery.

;Other motifs and themes
Motifs and themes derived from a number of traditions found in this drama include the [[labyrinth]], the monster, free will vs. predestination, the four elements, original sin, pride and disillusionment.&lt;ref&gt;Ambrose, Timothy. "Calderón and Borges: Discovering Infinity in the Labyrinth of Reason", ''A Star-Crossed Golden Age: Myth and the Spanish Comedia'', (ed.) Frederick A. de Armas, pp. 197–218. Lewisburg: Bucknell University press, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maurin, Margaret S. "The Monster, the Sepulchre and the Dark: Related Patterns of Imagery in ''La vida es sueño''", ''Hispanic Review'', 35 (1967): 161–78&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, Henry W.

==Analysis and interpretations==

===Rosaura subplot===
[[File:Burgtheater - Sigismund und Rosaura - Calderon de la Barca.jpg|thumb|upright|Burgtheater - Sigismund und Rosaura - Calderon de la Barca]]
The Rosaura subplot has been subjected to much criticism in the past as not belonging to the work. Menéndez y Pelayo saw it as a strange and exotic plot, like a parasitical vine.&lt;ref&gt;Marcelino Menéndez y Pelayo, ''Calderón y su teatro''. Madrid: A. Perez Dubrull, 1881.&lt;/ref&gt; Rosaura has also been dismissed as the simple stock character of the jilted woman. With the British School of Calderonistas, this attitude changed. A. E. Sloman explained how the main and secondary actions are linked.&lt;ref&gt;A. E. Sloman, "The Structure of Calderón's ''La vida es sueño''," in ''Critical Essays on the Theater of Calderón''," ed. Bruce W. Wardropper, 90–100. New York: New York University Press, 1965"&lt;/ref&gt; Others like E. M. Wilson and William M. Whitby consider Rosaura to be central to the work since she parallels Segismundo's actions and also serves as Segismundo's guide, leading him to a final conversion.&lt;ref&gt;E. M. Wilson, "On ''La vida es sueño''," in ''Critical Essays on the Theater of Calderón'', 63–89&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Whitby "Rosarura's Role in the Structure of ''La vida es sueño''," in ''Critical Essays on the Theater of Calderón'', 101–13&lt;/ref&gt; For some Rosaura must be studied as part of a Platonic ascent on the part of the Prince. Others compare her first appearance, falling from a horse/hippogriff to the plot of [[Ariosto]]'s ''[[Orlando furioso]]'' where Astolfo (the name of the character who deceives Rosaura in our play), also rides the hippogriff and witnesses a prophecy of the return of the mythical Golden Age. For [[Frederick de Armas]], Rosaura hides a mythological mystery already utilized by Ariosto. When she goes to Court, she takes on the name of [[Astraea (mythology)|Astraea]], the goddess of chastity and justice. Astraea was the last of the immortals to leave earth with the decline of the ages. Her return signals the return of a Golden Age. Many writers of the Renaissance and early modern periods used the figure of Astraea to praise the rulers of their times. It is possible that Rosaura (an anagram of ''auroras'', "dawns") could represent the return of a Golden Age during the reign of Segismundo, a figure that represents King [[Philip IV of Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;Frederick A. de Armas, ''The Return of Astraea: An Astral-Imperial Myth in Calderón''. Lexington: University of Kentucky Press, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:La vida es sueño, en el 35 Festival Internacional del Teatro Clásico (4).jpg|thumb|left|upright|''La vida es sueño'', 35th Festival]]

===Segismundo's conclusions===
There have been many different interpretations of the play’s ending, where Segismundo condemns the rebel soldier who freed him to life imprisonment in the tower. Some have suggested that this scene is ironic – that it raises questions about whether Segismundo will in fact be a just king. Others have pointed out that Calderón, who lived under the Spanish monarchy, could not have left the rebel soldier unpunished, because this would be an affront to royal authority.

It is worth considering that Segismundo’s transformation in the course of the play is not simply a moral awakening, but a realization of his social role as the heir to the throne, and this role requires him to act as kings act. For some, the act of punishing the rebel soldier makes him a Machiavellian prince.&lt;ref&gt;H. B. Hall, "Segismundo and the Rebel Soldier," Bulletin of Hispanic Studies 45 (1968): 189–200.&lt;/ref&gt; Others argue that, while this action may seem unjust, it is in keeping with his new social status as the king. Daniel L. Heiple traces a long tradition of works where treason seems to be rewarded, but the traitor or rebel is subsequently punished.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel L. Heiple, "The Tradition Behind the Punishment of the Rebel Soldier in ''La vida es sueño''," ''Bulletin of Hispanic Studies'' 50 (1973): 1–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

It may well be that, rather than intending his audience to see this action as purely right or wrong, Calderón purposefully made it ambiguous, creating an interesting tension in the play that adds to its depth.

'''Manasikara''' (Sanskrit and Pali, also ''manasikāra''; Tibetan Wylie: ''yid la byed pa'' or ''yid byed'') is a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] term that is translated as "attention" or "ego-centric demanding". It is defined as the process of the mind fixating upon an object.&lt;ref name=g1&gt;Guenther (1975), Kindle Locations 406-410.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eric1&gt;Kunsang (2004), p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Manasikara'' is identified within the Buddhist [[Abhidharma]] teachings as follows:
* One of the [[Mental_factors_(Buddhism)#Seven_universal_mental_factors|''seven universal mental factors'']] in the Theravada Abhidharma.
* One of the [[Mental_factors_(Buddhism)#Five_universal_mental_factors|''five universal mental factors'']] in the Mahayana Abhidharma

==Definitions==
===Theravada===
Bhikkhu Bodhi states:{{sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2012|loc=Kindle Locations 2225-2232}}
: The Pali word literally means “making in the mind.” Attention is the mental factor responsible for the mind’s advertence to the object, by virtue of which the object is made present to consciousness. Its characteristic is the conducting (sāraṇa) of the associated mental states towards the object. Its function is to yoke the associated states to the object. It is manifested as confrontation with an object, and its proximate cause is the object. Attention is like the rudder of a ship, which directs it to its destination, or like a charioteer who sends the well-trained horses (i.e. the associated states) towards their destination (the object). Manasikāra should be distinguished from [[vitakka]]: while the former turns its concomitants towards the object, the latter applies them onto the object. Manasikāra is an indispensable cognitive factor present in all states of consciousness; vitakka is a specialized factor which is not indispensable to cognition. 

The [[Atthasālinī]] (I, Part IV, Chapter 1, 133) and the [[Visuddhimagga]] (XIV, 152) define manasikāra as follows:

:...It has the characteristic of driving associated states towards the object, the function of joining (yoking) associated states to the object, the manifestation of facing the object. It is included in the saṅkhārakkhandha, and should be regarded as the charioteer of associated states because it regulates the object.&lt;ref&gt;Gorkom (2010), [https://archive.is/20130505135429/http://www.zolag.co.uk/Cetasikas/html_node/Vitality-and-Attention.html Definition of jīvitindriya]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Asanga|Abhidharma-samuccaya]] states: 

:What is manasikara? It is a continuity having the function of holding the mind to what has become its reference.&lt;ref name="g1"/&gt;

[[Herbert Guenther]] states:
: It is a cognition that keeps the complex of mind in its specific objective reference.&lt;ref name="g1"/&gt;

The difference between ''[[cetanā]]'' and ''manasikara'' is that ''cetanā'' brings the mind towards the object in a general move, while ''manasikara'' makes the mind fixate upon this particular objective reference.&lt;ref name="g1"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5728">In the teachings of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], the '''Manu''' is one of the most important beings at the highest levels of [[Initiation (Theosophy)|Initiation]] of the [[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom]], along with [[Sanat Kumara]], [[Gautama Buddha]], [[Maitreya (Theosophy)|Maitreya]], the [[Maha Chohan]], and [[Djwal Khul]].  According to Theosophy, each [[root race]] has its own ''Manu'' which physically [[Reincarnation|incarnates]] in an advanced body of an individual of the old root race and physically progenerates with a suitable female partner the first individuals of the new root race.  The Theosophical concept of the Manu is derived from the concept in [[Hinduism]] that the [[Manu (Hinduism)|Manu]] was the being who was the progenitor of the [[human race]]. 

When the ''Manu'' is spoken of in Theosophy, normally the "being" referred to, is the ''Vaivasvatu Manu.''

==Theosophy==
{{Theosophy}}
In Theosophy, the ''Vaivasvatu Manu'' is regarded as the progenitor of the fifth root race, the [[Root race#The fifth root race (Aryan)|Aryan root race]].&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path'' Adyar, Madras, India:1925 The Theosophical Publishing House Page 28&lt;/ref&gt;  This progeneration is believed to have taken place 100,000 years ago in [[Root race#The civilization of Atlantis|Atlantis]].  

The progenitor of the fourth root race, the [[Root race#The fourth root race (Atlantean)|Atlantean root race]], is called the ''Chakshusha Manu'' and is in appearance an individual of the [[Mongoloid race|Mongolian race]].&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path'' Adyar, Madras, India:1925 The Theosophical Publishing House Page 31&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to [[C.W. Leadbeater]], a colony will be established in [[Baja California]] by the [[Theosophical Society]] under the guidance of the [[Ascended masters|Masters of the Ancient Wisdom]] in the [[28th century]] for the intensive selective [[Eugenics|eugenic]] breeding of the [[Root race#The sixth root race|sixth root race]].  The Master [[Morya (Theosophy)|Morya]] will physically incarnate in order to be the Manu ("progenitor") of this new root race.&lt;ref&gt;Besant, Annie and Leadbeater, C.W. ''[[Man: Whence, How and Whither]]''  Adyar, India:1913 Theosophical Publishing House Part Three ''Whither'' Chapters 22-26 (Pages 353-495) Note: On page vii of the Introduction it is stated that the information in the book is a result of Leadbeater's inspection of the [[Akashic records]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ascended master teachings==
In the [[Ascended Master Teachings]], a group of [[religion]]s based on Theosophy, it is taught that the Vaivasvatu Manu has a ''[[twin flame]]'', i.e., a ''divine complement'' or ''celestial wife''.  However, her name has not yet been revealed.&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Mark L. and Elizabeth Clare Prophet (compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press Pages 378-379&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Ascended Master Teachings, the being C.W. Leadbeater called the "Chakshusha Manu" is referred to as ''Lord Himalaya''.&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Mark L. and Elizabeth Clare Prophet (compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press Pages 137-138&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]], "Lord Himalaya" was the teacher of [[Maitreya (Theosophy)|Maitreya]] when Maitreya incarnated in as one of the first individuals of the new Atlantean root race that was then being progenerated by the "Lord Himalaya" from the [[Root race#The third root race (Lemurian)|Lemurian root race]]—Maitreya served in the [[Garden of Eden]], which was actually a [[mystery school]] of the [[Great White Brotherhood]] run by the "Lord Himalaya" that was located in what is now [[San Diego, California]], which was then part of [[Lemuria (continent)|Lemuria]].&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Mark L. and Elizabeth Clare Prophet (compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press Page 205&lt;/ref&gt;

==Skeptical view==

The scholar [[K. Paul Johnson]] maintains that the "Masters" that [[Madame Blavatsky]] wrote about and produced letters from were actually idealizations of people who were her [[mentor]]s.  
However, although she mentioned the ''Manu'' in [[The Secret Doctrine]], she never claimed to have met him.

[[File:Assessment and treatment algorithm for overweight and obesity.png|thumb|450px|A medical algorithm for assessment and treatment of [[overweight]] and [[obesity]].]]
A '''medical algorithm''' is any [[computation]], [[formula]], [[statistical survey]], [[nomogram]], or [[look-up table]], useful in [[healthcare]].  [[Medical]] [[algorithm]]s include [[decision tree]] approaches to healthcare treatment (e.g., if [[symptom]]s A, B, and C are evident, then use treatment X) and also less clear-cut tools aimed at reducing or defining uncertainty.

==Scope==
Medical algorithms are part of a broader field which is usually fit under the aims of [[medical informatics]] and medical [[decision-making]]. Medical decisions occur in several areas of medical activity including medical test selection, [[diagnosis]], therapy and [[prognosis]], and [[automatic control]] of [[medical equipment]].

In relation to [[logic]]-based and [[artificial neural network]]-based [[clinical decision support system|clinical decision support systems]], which are also computer applications used in the medical decision-making field, algorithms are less complex in architecture, data structure and user interface. Medical algorithms are not necessarily implemented using digital computers. In fact, many of them can be represented on paper, in the form of diagrams, nomographs, etc.

==Examples==
A wealth of medical information exists in the form of published medical algorithms.  These algorithms range from simple [[calculation]]s to complex outcome [[prediction]]s.  Most [[clinician]]s use only a small subset routinely.

Examples of medical algorithms are:
* [[Calculators]], e.g. an on-line or stand-alone calculator for [[body mass index]] (BMI) when stature and body weight are given;
* [[Flowcharts]], e.g. a binary [[decision tree]] for deciding what is the [[etiology]] of [[chest pain]]
* [[Look-up table]]s, e.g. for looking up [[food energy]] and nutritional contents of foodstuffs
* [[Nomogram]]s, e.g. a moving circular slide to calculate body surface area or drug dosages.

A common class of algorithms are embedded in guidelines on the choice of treatments produced by many national, state, financial and local healthcare organisations and provided as knowledge resources for day to day use and for induction of new physicians. A field which has gained particular attention is the choice of medications for psychiatric conditions. In the United Kingdom, guidelines or algorithms for this have been produced by most of the circa 500 primary care trusts, substantially all of the circa 100 secondary care psychiatric units and many of the circa 10 000 general practices. In the US, there is a national (federal) initiative to provide them for all states, and by 2005 six states were adapting the approach of the [[Texas Medication Algorithm Project]] or otherwise working on their production.

A grammar—the [[Arden syntax]]—exists for describing algorithms in terms of [[medical logic module]]s. An approach such as this should allow exchange of MLMs between doctors and establishments, and enrichment of the common stock of tools.

==Purpose==
The intended purpose of medical algorithms is to improve and standardize decisions made in the delivery of [[medical care]]. Medical algorithms assist in standardizing selection and application of treatment regimens, with algorithm [[automation]] intended to reduce potential introduction of errors.  Some attempt to predict the outcome, for example [[ICU scoring systems|critical care scoring systems]].

Computerized health diagnostics algorithms can provide timely clinical decision support, improve adherence to [[evidence-based medicine|evidence-based]] [[guideline (medical)|guidelines]], and be a resource for education and research. 

Medical algorithms based on best practice can assist everyone involved in delivery of standardized treatment via a wide range of clinical care providers. Many are presented as [[Clinical trial protocol|protocol]]s and it is a key task in training to ensure people step outside the protocol when necessary.  In our present state of knowledge, generating hints and producing guidelines may be less satisfying to the authors, but more appropriate.

==Cautions==
In common with most science and medicine, algorithms whose contents are not wholly available for scrutiny and open to improvement should be regarded with suspicion.  

[[Computation]]s obtained from medical algorithms should be compared with, and tempered by, clinical knowledge and [[physician]] judgment.

'''Misogyny''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ɪ|ˈ|s|ɒ|dʒ|ɪ|n|i}}) is the hatred of, contempt for, or prejudice against [[Woman|women]] or [[girl]]s. Misogyny is manifest in numerous ways, including [[social exclusion]], [[sex discrimination]], [[hostility]], [[androcentrism]], [[patriarchy]], [[male privilege]], belittling of women, [[violence against women]], and [[sexual objectification]].&lt;ref name=Code2000&gt;{{cite book|last=Code|first=Lorraine|title=Encyclopedia of Feminist Theories|year=2000|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-415-13274-9|edition=1st|page=346}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kramarae2000&gt;{{cite book|last=Kramarae|first=Cheris|title=Routledge International Encyclopedia of Women|year=2000|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-0-415-92088-9|pages=1374–1377}}&lt;/ref&gt; Misogyny can be found within [[Religious text|sacred texts]] of [[religion]]s, [[Mythology|mythologies]], and [[Western philosophy|Western philosophies]].&lt;ref name=Code2000 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Clack1999 /&gt;

== Definitions ==

According to sociologist Allan G. Johnson, "misogyny is a cultural attitude of hatred for females because they are female". Johnson argues that:
{{quote|Misogyny .... is a central part of sexist prejudice and ideology and, as such, is an important basis for the [[oppression]] of females in male-dominated societies. Misogyny is manifested in many different ways, from jokes to pornography to violence to the self-contempt women may be taught to feel toward their own bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url = https://books.google.com/?id=V1kiW7x6J1MC&amp;pg=PA197&amp;dq=allan+johnson+misogyny#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title = The Blackwell dictionary of sociology: A user's guide to sociological language | isbn = 978-0-631-21681-0 | author1 = Johnson | first1 = Allan G | year = 2000 | accessdate = November 21, 2011}}, ("ideology" in all small capitals in original).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Sociologist [[Michael Flood]] at the [[University of Wollongong]] defines misogyny as the hatred of women, and notes:
{{quote|Though most common in men, misogyny also exists in and is practiced by women against other women or even themselves. Misogyny functions as an ideology or belief system that has accompanied patriarchal, or male-dominated societies for thousands of years and continues to place women in subordinate positions with limited access to power and decision making. […] Aristotle contended that women exist as natural deformities or imperfect males […] Ever since, women in [[Western culture]]s have internalised their role as societal scapegoats, influenced in the twenty-first century by multimedia objectification of women with its culturally sanctioned self-loathing and fixations on plastic surgery, anorexia and bulimia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url = https://books.google.com/?id=EUON2SYps-QC&amp;pg=PA444&amp;dq=michael+flood+misogyny#v=onepage&amp;q=michael%20flood%20misogyny&amp;f=false | title = International encyclopedia of men and masculinities | isbn = 978-0-415-33343-6 | author1 = Flood | first1 = Michael | date = July 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Dictionaries define misogyny as "hatred of women"&lt;ref&gt;''The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary on Historical Principles'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press (Oxford Univ. Press), [4th] ed. 1993 ({{ISBN|0-19-861271-0}})) (''SOED'') ("[h]atred of women").&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language'' (Boston, Mass.: Houghton Mifflin, 1992 ({{ISBN|0-395-44895-6}})) ("[h]atred of women").&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language Unabridged'' (G. &amp; C. Merriam, 1966) ("a hatred of women").&lt;/ref&gt; and as "hatred, dislike, or mistrust of women".&lt;ref&gt;''Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary'' (N.Y.: Random House, 2d ed. 2001 ({{ISBN|0-375-42566-7}})).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, primarily in response to events occurring in the [[Australian Parliament]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/transcript-of-julia-gillards-speech-20121009-27c36.html |title=Transcript of Julia Gillard's speech |publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald |access-date=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Macquarie Dictionary]] (which documents [[Australian English]] and [[New Zealand English]]) expanded the definition to include not only hatred of women but also "entrenched prejudices against women".&lt;ref name=Macquarie&gt;{{cite news|last=Daley|first=Gemma|title=Macquarie Dictionary has last word on misogyny|url=http://www.afr.com/p/national/macquarie_dictionary_has_last_word_NzrQFdWcPJG6G8qLRRiZtK|date=17 October 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019181518/http://www.afr.com/p/national/macquarie_dictionary_has_last_word_NzrQFdWcPJG6G8qLRRiZtK|archivedate=19 October 2012|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The counterpart of misogyny is [[misandry]], the hatred or dislike of men; the [[antonym]] of misogyny is [[philogyny]], the love or fondness of women.

== Historical usage ==

=== Classical Greece ===
[[File:Seated Euripides Louvre Ma343.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Euripides]]]]

In his book ''City of Sokrates: An Introduction to Classical Athens'', J.W. Roberts argues that older than tragedy and comedy was a misogynistic tradition in Greek literature, reaching back at least as far as [[Hesiod]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url = https://books.google.com/?id=73kTsV4FdrQC&amp;pg=PA22&amp;dq=Sokrates+misogyny+misogynist#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title = City of Sokrates: An Introduction to Classical Athens | isbn = 978-0-203-19479-9 | author1 = Roberts | first1 = J.W | date = 2002-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''misogyny'' itself comes directly into English from the Ancient Greek word ''misogunia'' ({{lang|grc|μισογυνία}}), which survives in several passages.

The earlier, longer, and more complete passage comes from a moral tract known as ''On Marriage'' (''c''. 150 BC) by the [[Stoicism|stoic]] philosopher [[Antipater of Tarsus]].&lt;ref&gt;The ''[[editio princeps]]'' is on page 255 of volume three of ''[[Stoicorum Veterum Fragmenta]]'' (''SVF'', Old Stoic Fragments), see [[Misogyny#External links|External links]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Deming"&gt;A recent critical text with translation is in [https://books.google.com/books?id=u_6a-sMDv6AC&amp;pg=PA221&amp;lpg=PA221&amp;dq=appendix+a+antipater+of+tarsus&amp;source=web&amp;ots=JlCnsyRBGf&amp;sig=7zsKzMVEBnV3tHag9z7E4cWCeLs&amp;hl=en Appendix A] to Will Deming, ''Paul on Marriage and Celibacy: The Hellenistic Background of 1 Corinthians 7'', pp. 221–226.

''Misogunia'' appears in the [[accusative case]] on page 224 of Deming, as the fifth word in line 33 of his Greek text.
It is split over lines 25–26 in von Arnim.&lt;/ref&gt; Antipater argues that marriage is the foundation of the state, and considers it to be based on divine ([[Polytheism|polytheistic]]) decree. He uses ''misogunia'' to describe the sort of writing the tragedian [[Euripides]] eschews, stating that he "reject[s] the hatred of women in his writing" (ἀποθέμενος τὴν ἐν τῷ γράφειν μισογυνίαν).  He then offers an example of this, quoting from a lost play of Euripides in which the merits of a dutiful wife are praised.&lt;ref name="Deming" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;38-43, fr. 63, in von Arnim, J. (ed.). ''Stoicorum Veterum Fragmenta.'' Vol. 3. Leipzig: Teubner, 1903.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The other surviving use of the original Greek word is by [[Chrysippus]], in a fragment from ''On affections'', quoted by [[Galen]] in ''[[Hippocrates]] on Affections''.&lt;ref&gt;''SVF'' 3:103. ''Misogyny'' is the first word on the page.&lt;/ref&gt; Here, ''misogyny'' is the first in a short list of three "disaffections"—women (''misogunia''), wine (''misoinia'', μισοινία) and humanity (''misanthrōpia'', μισανθρωπία). Chrysippus' point is more abstract than Antipater's, and Galen quotes the passage as an example of an opinion contrary to his own. What is clear, however, is that he groups hatred of women with hatred of humanity generally, and even hatred of wine. "It was the prevailing medical opinion of his day that wine strengthens body and soul alike."&lt;ref name=Tieleman&gt;Teun L. Tieleman, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=BBiw96gj8gkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=chrysippus+on+affections&amp;sig=6f6Y84rR_VZzorWxiGfFMYViuvM Chrysippus' on Affections:] Reconstruction and Interpretations'', (Leiden: [[Brill Publishers]], 2003), p. 162. {{ISBN|90-04-12998-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; So Chrysippus, like his fellow stoic Antipater, views misogyny negatively, as a [[disease]]; a dislike of something that is good. It is this issue of conflicted or alternating emotions that was philosophically contentious to the ancient writers. Ricardo Salles suggests that the general stoic view was that "[a] man may not only alternate between philogyny and misogyny, philanthropy and misanthropy, but be prompted to each by the other."&lt;ref&gt;Ricardo Salles, ''Metaphysics, Soul, and Ethics in Ancient Thought: Themes from the Work of Richard Sorabji'', (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 2005), 485.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aristotle]] has also been accused of being a misogynist; he has written that women were inferior to men. According to Cynthia Freeland (1994):

{{quote|Aristotle says that the courage of a man lies in commanding, a woman's lies in obeying; that 'matter yearns for form, as the female for the male and the ugly for the beautiful'; that women have fewer teeth than men; that a female is an incomplete male or 'as it were, a deformity': which contributes only matter and not form to the generation of offspring; that in general 'a woman is perhaps an inferior being'; that female characters in a tragedy will be inappropriate if they are too brave or too clever[.]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-femhist/#Mis |title=Feminist History of Philosophy (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the ''Routledge philosophy guidebook to Plato and the Republic'', Nickolas Pappas describes the "problem of misogyny" and states:

{{quote|In the ''Apology'', Socrates calls those who plead for their lives in court "no better than women" (35b)... The ''Timaeus'' warns men that if they live immorally they will be reincarnated as women (42b-c; cf. 75d-e). The ''Republic'' contains a number of comments in the same spirit (387e, 395d-e, 398e, 431b-c, 469d), evidence of nothing so much as of contempt toward women. Even Socrates' words for his bold new proposal about marriage... suggest that the women are to be "held in common" by men. He never says that the men might be held in common by the women... We also have to acknowledge Socrates' insistence that men surpass women at any task that both sexes attempt (455c, 456a), and his remark in Book 8 that one sign of democracy's moral failure is the sexual equality it promotes (563b).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url = https://books.google.com/?id=VujWajIWxkUC&amp;pg=PA109&amp;dq=Socrates+misogyny+misogynist#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title = Routledge philosophy guidebook to Plato and the Republic | isbn = 978-0-415-29996-1 | author1 = Pappas | first1 = Nickolas | date = 2003-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''Misogynist'' is also found in the Greek—''misogunēs'' ({{lang|grc|μισογύνης}})—in ''Deipnosophistae'' (above) and in [[Plutarch]]'s ''Parallel Lives'', where it is used as the title of [[Heracles]] in the history of [[Phocion]]. It was the title of a play by [[Menander]], which we know of from book seven (concerning [[Alexandria]]) of [[Strabo]]'s 17 volume ''[[Geographica|Geography]]'',&lt;ref name="Liddell"&gt;[[Henry George Liddell]] and [[Robert Scott (philologist)|Robert Scott]], ''[[A Greek–English Lexicon]]'' (''LSJ''), revised and augmented by Henry Stuart Jones and Roderick McKenzie, (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1940). {{ISBN|0-19-864226-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]],''[[Geographica (Strabo)|Geography]]'', Book 7 [Alexandria] Chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt; and quotations of Menander by [[Clement of Alexandria]] and [[Stobaeus]] that relate to marriage.&lt;ref&gt;[[Menander]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=JC11wYBkrhkC&amp;pg=PA268&amp;dq=The+Misogynist+(Misogynes)&amp;sig=y98In1TUseOWVGHrcOOMQ0Vx1dU ''The Plays and Fragments''], translated by Maurice Balme, contributor [[Peter G.

[[File:CiceroBust.jpg|thumb|[[Cicero|Marcus Tullius Cicero]]]]
Cicero reports that Greek philosophers considered misogyny to be caused by [[gynophobia]], a fear of women.&lt;ref name="Cicero"&gt;[[Cicero|Marcus Tullius Cicero]], ''[[Tusculanae Quaestiones]]'', Book 4, Chapter 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|It is the same with other diseases; as the desire of glory, a passion for women, to which the Greeks give the name of ''philogyneia'': and thus all other diseases and sicknesses are generated. But those feelings which are the contrary of these are supposed to have fear for their foundation, as a hatred of women, such as is displayed in the ''Woman-hater'' of Atilius; or the hatred of the whole human species, as Timon is reported to have done, whom they call the Misanthrope. Of the same kind is inhospitality. And all these diseases proceed from a certain dread of such things as they hate and avoid.&lt;ref name="Cicero" /&gt;|Cicero|''[[Tusculanae Quaestiones]]'', 1st century BC.}}

In summary, Greek literature considered misogyny to be a [[disease]]—an [[anti-social behaviour|anti-social]] condition—in that it ran contrary to their perceptions of the value of women as wives and of the family as the foundation of society. These points are widely noted in the secondary literature.&lt;ref name="Deming" /&gt;

=== Ancient Greek ===
In ''Misogyny: The World's Oldest Prejudice'', [[Jack Holland (writer)|Jack Holland]] argues that there is evidence of misogyny in the [[mythology]] of the ancient world. In [[Greek mythology]] according to Hesiod, the human race had already experienced a peaceful, autonomous existence as a companion to the gods before the creation of women. When [[Prometheus]] decides to steal the secret of fire from the gods, [[Zeus]] becomes infuriated and decides to punish humankind with an "evil thing for their delight". This "evil thing" is [[Pandora]], the first woman, who carried a jar (usually described—incorrectly—as a box) which she was told to never open. [[Epimetheus (mythology)|Epimetheus]] (the brother of Prometheus) is overwhelmed by her beauty, disregards Prometheus' warnings about her, and marries her. Pandora cannot resist peeking into the jar, and by opening it she unleashes into the world all evil; [[childbirth|labour]], [[Illness|sickness]], [[old age]], and [[death]].&lt;ref&gt;Holland, J: ''Misogyny: The World's Oldest Prejudice'', pp. 12–13.

=== Buddhism ===
{{Main article|Women in Buddhism}}
In his book ''The Power of Denial: Buddhism, Purity, and Gender'', professor Bernard Faure of [[Columbia University]] argued generally that "Buddhism is paradoxically neither as sexist nor as egalitarian as is usually thought." He remarked, "Many feminist scholars have emphasized the misogynistic (or at least androcentric) nature of Buddhism" and stated that Buddhism morally exalts its male monks while the mothers and wives of the monks also have important roles. Additionally, he wrote:
{{quote|While some scholars see Buddhism as part of a movement of emancipation, others see it as a source of oppression. Perhaps this is only a distinction between optimists and pessimists, if not between idealists and realists... As we begin to realize, the term "Buddhism" does not designate a monolithic entity, but covers a number of doctrines, ideologies, and practices--some of which seem to invite, tolerate, and even cultivate "otherness" on their margins.&lt;ref name=bernard&gt;{{cite web |url=http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/i7538.html |title=Sample Chapter for Faure, B.: The Power of Denial: Buddhism, Purity, and Gender |publisher=Press.princeton.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-10-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005011657/http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/i7538.html |archivedate=2013-10-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Differences in tradition and interpretations of scripture have caused sects of Christianity to differ in their beliefs with regard their treatment of women.

In ''The Troublesome Helpmate'', Katharine M. Rogers argues that Christianity is misogynistic, and she lists what she says are specific examples of misogyny in the [[Pauline epistles]]. She states:

{{quote|The foundations of early Christian misogyny — its guilt about sex, its insistence on female subjection, its dread of female seduction — are all in St. Paul's epistles.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Katharine M. ''The Troublesome Helpmate: A History of Misogyny in Literature,'' 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In K. K. Ruthven's ''Feminist Literary Studies: An Introduction'', Ruthven makes reference to Rogers' book and argues that the "legacy of Christian misogyny was consolidated by the so-called 'Fathers' of the Church, like [[Tertullian]], who thought a woman was not only 'the gateway of the devil' but also 'a temple built over a sewer'."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url = https://books.google.com/?id=clOT7Hg2CfAC&amp;pg=PA83&amp;dq=christian+misogyny#v=onepage&amp;q=christian%20misogyny&amp;f=false | title = Feminist literary studies: An introduction | isbn = 978-0-521-39852-7 | author1 = Ruthven | first1 = K.

However, some other scholars have argued that Christianity does not include misogynistic principles, or at least that a proper interpretation of Christianity would not include misogynistic principles. David M. Scholer, a biblical scholar at [[Fuller Theological Seminary]], stated that the verse Galatians 3:28 ("There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus") is "the fundamental Pauline theological basis for the inclusion of women and men as equal and mutual partners in all of the ministries of the church."&lt;ref name=CBMW&gt;{{cite web|title=Galatians 3:28 – prooftext or context?|url=http://cbmw.org/staff/|publisher=The council on biblical manhood and womanhood|accessdate= January 6, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206045217/http://cbmw.org/staff/|archivedate= February 6, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hove, Richard.

Galatians 3:28 and the Gender Dispute'', Richard Hove argues that—while Galatians 3:28 does mean that one's sex does not affect salvation—"there remains a pattern in which the wife is to emulate the church's submission to Christ ({{bibleverse||Eph|5:21-33|KJV}}) and the husband is to emulate Christ's love for the church."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url = https://books.google.com/?id=WcyqvWfJnyYC&amp;pg=PA283&amp;dq=ken+campbell+3:28+Rochard+Hove#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title = Marriage and family in the biblical world | isbn = 978-0-8308-2737-4 | author1 = Campbell | first1 = Ken M | date = October 1, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Christian Men Who Hate Women'', clinical psychologist Margaret J. Rinck has written that Christian social culture often allows a misogynist "misuse of the biblical ideal of submission". However, she argues that this a distortion of the "healthy relationship of mutual submission" which is actually specified in Christian doctrine, where "[l]ove is based on a deep, mutual respect as the guiding principle behind all decisions, actions, and plans".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Christian Men Who Hate Women: Healing Hurting Relationships|first=Margaret J.|last=Rinck

=== Islam ===
{{Main article|Women in Islam}}
{{See also|Namus|Islam and domestic violence}}

The fourth chapter (or ''[[sura]]'') of the [[Quran]] is called "Women" ([[An-Nisa]]). The [[An-Nisa, 34|34th verse]] is a key verse in feminist criticism of [[Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;"Verse 34 of Chapter 4 is an oft-cited Verse in the Qur'an used to demonstrate that Islam is structurally patriarchal, and thus Islam internalizes male dominance."
Dahlia Eissa, "[http://www.wluml.org/node/443#_ftn42 Constructing the Notion of Male Superiority over Women in Islam]: The influence of sex and gender stereotyping in the interpretation of the Qur'an and the implications for a modernist exegesis of rights", Occasional Paper 11 in ''Occasional Papers'' (Empowerment International, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt;
The verse reads: "Men are the maintainers of women because Allah has made some of them to excel others and because they spend out of their property; the good women are therefore obedient, guarding the unseen as Allah has guarded; and (as to) those on whose part you fear desertion, admonish them, and leave them alone in the sleeping-places and beat them; then if they obey you, do not seek a way against them; surely Allah is High, Great."

In his book ''Popular Islam and Misogyny: A Case Study of Bangladesh'', Taj Hashmi discusses misogyny in relation to Muslim culture (and to [[Bangladesh]] in particular), writing:

{{quote|[T]hanks to the subjective interpretations of the Quran (almost exclusively by men), the preponderance of the misogynic mullahs and the regressive Shariah law in most "Muslim" countries, Islam is synonymously known as a promoter of misogyny in its worst form. Although there is no way of defending the so-called "great" traditions of Islam as libertarian and egalitarian with regard to women, we may draw a line between the Quranic texts and the corpus of avowedly misogynic writing and spoken words by the mullah having very little or no relevance to the Quran.&lt;ref&gt;Hashmi, Taj.

In his book ''[[No god but God: The Origins, Evolution, and Future of Islam|No god but God]]'', [[University of Southern California]] professor [[Reza Aslan]] wrote that "misogynistic interpretation" has been persistently attached to An-Nisa, 34 because commentary on the Quran "has been the exclusive domain of Muslim men".&lt;ref name=issue&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/20/AR2006102001261.html|publisher=Washington Post|title=Clothes Aren't the Issue|date=October 22, 2006|first=Asra Q.|last=Nomani}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars William M. Reynolds and Julie A. Webber have written that [[Guru Nanak]], the founder of the [[Sikh]] faith tradition, was a "fighter for women's rights" that was "in no way misogynistic" in contrast to some of his contemporaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=87|title=Expanding curriculum theory: dis/positions and lines of flight |author=Julie A.

=== Scientology ===
{{See also|Scientology and abortion|Scientology and gender|Scientology and marriage|Scientology and sex}}
In his book ''Scientology: A New Slant on Life'', [[L. Ron Hubbard]] wrote the following passage:
{{quote|A society in which women are taught anything but the management of a family, the care of men, and the creation of the future generation is a society which is on its way out.&lt;/blockquote&gt;}}

In the same book, he also wrote:

{{quote|The historian can peg the point where a society begins its sharpest decline at the instant when women begin to take part, on an equal footing with men, in political and business affairs, since this means that the men are decadent and the women are no longer women. This is not a sermon on the role or position of women; it is a statement of bald and basic fact.&lt;/blockquote&gt;}}

These passages, along with other ones of a similar nature from Hubbard, have been criticised by Alan Scherstuhl of ''[[The Village Voice]]'' as expressions of hatred towards women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Church of Scientology does not want you to see L.

Gordon Melton]] has written that Hubbard later disregarded and abrogated much of his earlier views about women, which Melton views as merely echoes of common prejudices at the time. Melton has also stated that the [[Church of Scientology]] welcomes both genders equally at all levels—from leadership positions to [[Auditing (Scientology)|auditing]] and so on—since Scientologists view people as [[Thetan|spiritual beings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patheos.com/Library/Scientology/Ethics-Morality-Community/Gender-and-Sexuality.html |title=Gender and Sexuality |publisher=Patheos.com |date=2012-07-26 |accessdate=2013-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Misogynistic ideas among prominent western thinkers ==
Numerous influential [[Western philosophy|Western philosophers]] have been expressed ideas that can be characterized as misogynistic, including [[Aristotle's views on women|Aristotle]], [[René Descartes]], [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[John Locke]], [[David Hume]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|G.

=== Aristotle ===
Aristotle believed women were inferior and described them as "deformed males".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|edition = Spring 2016|title = Feminist History of Philosophy|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2016/entries/feminism-femhist/|date = 2016-01-01|first = Charlotte|last = Witt|first2 = Lisa|last2 = Shapiro|editor-first = Edward N.|editor-last = Zalta}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith 467–478"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Plato and Aristotle on the Nature of Women|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236725862|journal = Journal of the History of Philosophy|pages = 467–478|volume = 21|issue = 4|doi = 10.1353/hph.1983.0090|first = Nicholas D.|last = Smith|year = 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his work ''Politics'', he states 

&lt;blockquote&gt;as regards the sexes, the male is by nature superior and the female inferior, the male ruler and the female subject 4 (1254b13-14).&lt;ref name="Smith 467–478"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another example is ''Cynthia's catalog'' where Cynthia states "Aristotle says that the courage of a man lies in commanding, a woman's lies in obeying; that 'matter yearns for form, as the female for the male and the ugly for the beautiful'; that women have fewer teeth than men; that a female is an incomplete male or 'as it were, a deformity'.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Aristotle believed that men and women naturally differed both physically and mentally. He claimed that women are "more mischievous, less simple, more impulsive ... more compassionate[,] ... more easily moved to tears[,] ... more jealous, more querulous, more apt to scold and to strike[,] ... more prone to despondency and less hopeful[,] ... more void of shame or self-respect, more false of speech, more deceptive, of more retentive memory [and] ... also more wakeful; more shrinking [and] more difficult to rouse to action" than men.&lt;ref&gt;History of Animals, 608b. 1–14&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jean-Jacques Rousseau ===
[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] is well known for his views against equal rights for women for example in his treatise ''[[Emile, or On Education|Emile]]'', he writes: "Always justify the burdens you impose upon girls but impose them anyway... . They must be thwarted from an early age... . They must be exercised to constraint, so that it costs them nothing to stifle all their fantasies to submit them to the will of others." Other quotes consist of "closed up in their houses", "must receive the decisions of fathers and husbands like that of the church".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Rousseau and Feminist Revision|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/241893904|journal = Eighteenth-Century Life|pages = 51–54|volume = 34|issue = 3|doi = 10.1215/00982601-2010-012|first = C.|last = Blum|year = 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Charles Darwin ===
[[Charles Darwin]] wrote on the subject female inferiority through the lens of human evolution.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The history of the human female inferiority ideas in evolutionary biology|journal = Rivista di Biologia|date = 2002-12-01|issn = 0035-6050|pmid = 12680306|pages = 379–412|volume = 95|issue = 3|first = Gerald|last = Bergman}}&lt;/ref&gt; He noted in his book ''The Descent of Men'':  "young of both sexes resembled the adult female in most species" which he extrapolated and further reasoned "males were more evolutionarily advanced than females". Darwin believed all savages, children and women had smaller brains and therefore led more by instinct and less by reason.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Such ideas quickly spread to other scientists such as Professor Carl Vogt of natural sciences at the University of Geneva who argued "the child, the female, and the senile white" had the mental traits of a "grown up Negro", that the female is similar in intellectual capacity and personality traits to both infants and the "lower races"  such as blacks while drawing conclusion that women are closely related to lower animals than men and "hence we should discover a greater apelike resemblance if we were to take a female as our standard".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Darwin's beliefs about women were also reflective of his attitudes towards women in general for example his views towards marriage as a young man in which he was quoted ""how should I manage all my business if obligated to go everyday walking with my wife – Ehau!" and that being married was "worse than being a Negro".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Or in other instances his concern of his son marrying a woman named Martineau about which he wrote "... he shall be not much better than her "nigger." Imagine poor Erasmus a nigger to so philosophical and energetic a lady ... Martineau had just returned from a whirlwind tour of America, and was full of married women's property rights ... Perfect equality of rights is part of her doctrine...We must pray for our poor "nigger.""&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Arthur Schopenhauer ===
[[Arthur Schopenhauer]] has been noted as a misogynist by many such as the philosopher, critic, and author Tom Grimwood.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Limits of Misogyny: Schopenhauer, "On Women"|url = http://philpapers.org/rec/GRITLO|journal = Kritike: An Online Journal of Philosophy|date = 2008-01-01|pages = 131–145|volume = 2|issue = 2|first = Tom|last = Grimwood|doi=10.3860/krit.v2i2.854}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2008 article Grimwood wrote published in the philosophical journal of ''Kritique,'' Grimwood argues that Schopenhauer's misogynistic works have largely escaped attention despite being more noticeable than those of other philosophers such as Nietzsche.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For example, he noted Schopenhauer's works where the latter had argued women only have "meagre" reason comparable that of "the animal" "who lives in the present". Other works he noted consisted of Schopenhauer's argument that women's only role in nature is to further the species through childbirth and hence is equipped with the power to seduce and "capture" men.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; He goes on to state that women's cheerfulness is chaotic and disruptive which is why it is crucial to exercise obedience to those with rationality. For her to function beyond her rational subjugator is a threat against men as well as other women, he notes. Schopenhauer also thought women's cheerfulness is an expression of her lack of morality and incapability to understand abstract or objective meaning such as art.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This is followed up by his quote "have never been able to produce a single, really great, genuine and original achievement in the fine arts, or bring to anywhere into the world a work of permanent value".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Arthur Schopenhauer also blamed women for the fall of King Louis XIII and triggering the French Revolution, in which he was later quoted as saying:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

"At all events, a false position of the female sex, such as has its most acute symptom in our lady-business, is a fundamental defect of the state of society. Proceeding from the heart of this, it is bound to spread its noxious influence to all parts."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Schopenhauer has also been accused of misogyny for his essay "On Women" (Über die Weiber), in which he expressed his opposition to what he called "Teutonico-Christian stupidity" on female affairs. He argued that women are "by nature meant to obey" as they are "childish, frivolous, and short sighted".&lt;ref name="Clack1999" /&gt; He claimed that no woman had ever produced great art or "any work of permanent value".&lt;ref name="Clack1999" /&gt; He also argued that women did not possess any real beauty:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Durant|first1=Will|title=The Story of Philosophy|date=1983|publisher=Simon and Schuster|location=New York, N.Y.|isbn=978-0-671-20159-3|page=257}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|It is only a man whose intellect is clouded by his sexual impulse that could give the name of the ''fair sex'' to that under-sized, narrow-shouldered, broad-hipped, and short-legged race; for the whole beauty of the sex is bound up with this impulse. Instead of calling them beautiful there would be more warrant for describing women as the unaesthetic sex.}}

[[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel's]] view of women can be characterized as misogynistic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gallagher|first=Shaun|title=Hegel, history, and interpretation|year=1997|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-3381-2|page=235|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OdlvNHnC6KMC&amp;pg=PA235&amp;dq=Hegel+misogyny+misogynistic#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Passages from Hegel's ''[[Elements of the Philosophy of Right]]'' illustrate the criticism:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url = https://books.google.com/?id=rJqm5iQcsqoC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=Hegel+misogyny+misogynistic#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title =Feminist Reflections on the History of Philosophy | isbn = 978-1-4020-2488-7 | author1 = Alanen | first1 = Lilli | last2 = Witt | first2 = Charlotte | year = 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women regulate their actions not by the demands of universality, but by arbitrary inclinations and opinions.}}

== Online misogyny ==
Misogynistic rhetoric is prevalent online and has grown rhetorically more aggressive. The public debate over gender-based attacks has increased significantly, leading to calls for policy interventions and better responses by social networks like [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]].&lt;ref name=jane&gt;{{cite journal |last= Jane |first= Emma Alice |title= 'Back to the kitchen, cunt': speaking the unspeakable about online misogyny |journal= [[Continuum: Journal of Media &amp; Cultural Studies]] |volume= 28 |issue= 4 |year= 2014 |pages= 558–570 |doi= 10.1080/10304312.2014.924479}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Philipovic |first= Jill |title= Blogging While Female: How Internet Misogyny Parallels Real-World Harassment| journal = Yale Journal of Law and Feminism |volume= 19 |issue= 2|pages= 295–303 |year= 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2016 study conducted by the [[Demos (UK think tank)|think tank Demos]] concluded that 50% of all misogynistic tweets on [[Twitter]] come from women themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-36380247 Twitter abuse - '50% of misogynistic tweets from women'], ''[[BBC]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Most targets are women who are visible in the public sphere, women who speak out about the threats they receive, and women who are perceived to be associated with [[feminism]] or feminist gains. Authors of misogynistic messages are usually anonymous or otherwise difficult to identify. Their rhetoric involves misogynistic epithets and graphic and sexualized imagery, centers on the women's physical appearance, and prescribes sexual violence as a corrective for the targeted women. Examples of famous women who spoke out about misogynistic attacks are [[Anita Sarkeesian]], [[Laurie Penny]], [[Caroline Criado Perez]], [[Stella Creasy]], and [[Lindy West]].&lt;ref name=jane /&gt;

The insults and threats directed at different women tend to be very similar. [[Sady Doyle]] who has been the target of online threats noted the "overwhelmingly impersonal, repetitive, stereotyped quality" of the abuse, the fact that "all of us are being called the same things, in the same tone".&lt;ref name=jane /&gt;

== Psychological impact ==

=== Internalized misogyny ===
{{Main article|Internalized sexism}}
Internalized sexism is when an individual enacts sexist actions and attitudes towards themselves and people of their own sex.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Bearman, Steve, Neill Korobov, and Avril Thorne. "The fabric of internalized sexism." ''Journal of Integrated Social Sciences'' 1, no. 1 (2009): 10-47.&lt;/ref&gt;  On a larger scale, internalized sexism falls under the broad topic of [[internalized oppression]], which "consists of oppressive practices that continue to make the rounds even when members of the oppressor group are not present".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Women who experience internalized misogyny may express it through minimizing the value of women, mistrusting women, and believing gender bias in favor of men.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;Szymanski, Gupta, and Carr. 2009. "Internalized Misogyny as a Moderator of the Link between Sexist Events and Women’s Psychological Distress." ''Sex Roles'' 16, no. 1-2: 101–109.&lt;/ref&gt; Women, after hearing men demean the value and skills of women repeatedly, eventually internalize their beliefs and apply the misogynistic beliefs to themselves and other women.&lt;ref&gt;Bearman, Steve; Korobov, Neill; Thorne, Avril. 2009. "The fabric of internalized sexism." ''Journal of Integrated Social Sciences'' 1, no. 1: 10-47.&lt;/ref&gt; A common manifestation of internalized misogyny is [[lateral violence]].

== Feminist theory ==
Subscribers to one model say that some misogyny results from the [[Madonna–whore complex]], which is the inability to see women as anything other than "mothers" or "whores"; people with this complex place each encountered woman into one of these categories. Another variant model alleges that one cause of misogyny is some men thinking in terms of a virgin/whore dichotomy, which results in them considering as "whores" any women who do not adhere to an [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic]] standard of moral purity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07491409.2000.10162569#.U8QlTmdOXcs |first=Leah M. |last=Wyman |first2=George N. |last2=Dionisopolous |year=2000 |title=Transcending The Virgin/Whore Dichotomy: Telling Mina's Story in ''Bram Stoker's Dracula'' |journal=[[Women's Studies in Communication]] |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=209–237 |doi=10.1080/07491409.2000.10162569 |accessdate= July 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 20th century, [[second-wave feminism|second-wave feminist]] theorists argued that misogyny is both a cause and a result of [[Patriarchy|patriarchal]] [[social structure]]s.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., Kate Millet's ''Sexual Politics'', adapted from her doctoral dissertation is normally cited as the originator of this viewpoint; though Katharine M Rogers had also published similar ideas previously.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist [[Michael Flood]] has argued that "misandry lacks the systemic, trans-historic, institutionalized, and legislated antipathy of misogyny".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/?id=EUON2SYps-QC&amp;pg=PA442&amp;dq=michael+flood+misandry#v=onepage&amp;q=michael%20flood%20misandry&amp;f=false | title = International encyclopedia of men and masculinities | isbn = 978-0-415-33343-6 | author1 = Flood | first1 = Michael | date = 2007-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== British legal situation ==
In recent years there has been increasing discussion in the UK of misogyny being added to the list of aggravating factors that are commonly referred to by the media as “[[hate crime]]s”. Aggravating factors in criminal sentencing currently include hostility to a victim due to characteristics such as sexuality, race or disability.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sentencingcouncil.org.uk/explanatory-material/item/aggravating-and-mitigating-factors/ "Aggravating and mitigating factors"], Sentencing Council.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Nottinghamshire Police began a pilot project to record misogynistic behaviour as either hate crime or hate incidents, depending on whether the action was a criminal offence.&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, Libby, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/09/uk-police-chiefs-urged-to-adopt-harassment-of-women-as-hate "UK police chiefs urged to adopt harassment of women as hate crime"], ''The Guardian'', July 9, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Over two years (April 2016-March 2018) there were 174 reports made, of which 73 were classified as crimes and 101 as incidents.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-44740362 "Misogyny hate crime in Nottinghamshire gives 'shocking' results"], BBC News, July 9, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2018 it was announced that the [[Law Commission (England and Wales)|Law Commission]] would conduct a review into whether misogynistic conduct, as well as hostility due to [[ageism]], [[misandry]] or towards groups such as [[goth subculture|goths]], should be treated as a hate crime.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-45423789 "Misogyny could become hate crime as legal review is announced"], BBC News, September 6, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grierson, Jamie, [https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/oct/16/review-of-uk-hate-law-to-consider-misogyny-and-ageism "Review of UK hate crime law to consider misogyny and ageism"], ''The Guardian'', October 16, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2018, two senior police officers, [[Sara Thornton (police officer)|Sara Thornton]], chair of the National Police Chiefs' Council, and [[Cressida Dick]], Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, stated that police forces should focus on more serious crimes such as burglary and violent offences, and not on recording incidents which are not crimes.&lt;ref&gt;Tobin, Olivia, [https://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/met-police-chief-cressida-dick-backs-top-cop-sara-thornton-on-tackling-burglars-and-violence-not-a3978526.html "Met chief Cressida Dick backs senior police officer Sara Thornton on tackling burglars and violence ahead of hate crimes"], ''Evening Standard'', November 2, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Thornton said that "treating misogyny as a hate crime is a concern for some well-organised campaigning organisations", but that police forces "do not have the resources to do everything".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-46053069 "Focus on violent crime not misogyny, says police chief"], BBC News, November 1, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism of the concept ==

[[Camille Paglia]], a self-described "dissident feminist" who has often been at odds with other academic feminists, argues that there are serious flaws in the [[Marxism]]-inspired&lt;ref&gt;"Marxist feminists reduced the historical cult of woman’s virginity to her property value, her worth on the male marriage market.", Paglia, 1991, ''Sexual Persona'', p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; interpretation of misogyny that is prevalent in [[second-wave feminism]]. In contrast, Paglia argues that a close reading of historical texts reveals that men do not ''hate'' women but ''fear'' them.&lt;ref&gt;Paglia, Camille (1991). ''[[Sexual Personae]]'', NY: Vintage, Chapter 1 and passim.&lt;/ref&gt; Christian Groes-Green has argued that misogyny must be seen in relation to its opposite which he terms philogyny. Criticizing [[R. W. Connell]]'s theory of hegemonic masculinities, he shows how philogynous masculinities play out among youth in Maputo, Mozambique.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Groes-Green |first=Christian |date=2011 |title=Philogynous Masculinities: Contextualizing Alternative Manhood in Mozambique |url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1097184X11427021 |journal=Men and Masculinities |language=en |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=91–111 |doi=10.1177/1097184x11427021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Missionaries of Charity attack in Aden''' was a [[mass murder]] crime committed by unknown gunmen inside a home for older people in [[Aden]], [[Yemen]] on 4 March 2016.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/05/world/middleeast/gunmen-kill-14-at-nursing-home-in-yemen-started-by-mother-teresa.html|title=Gunmen Kill 16 at Nursing Home in Yemen Started by Mother Teresa|date=5 March 2016|work=The New York Times|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

16 people were killed including four [[Catholicism|Catholic]] nuns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/here-are-the-faces-of-the-nuns-who-were-martyred-in-yemen-84893|title=Here are the faces of the nuns who were martyred in Yemen|work=Catholic News Agency|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; An Indian priest, Tom Ozhonaniel, was kidnapped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/yemen-gunmen-kidnap-indian-priest-care-home-where-16-including-4-nuns-were-slaughtered-1547876|title=Yemen: Gunmen kidnap Indian priest from care home where 16 including 4 nuns were slaughtered|author=William Watkinson|work=International Business Times UK|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{See also|Christianity in Yemen}}
Christian presence in [[Yemen]] goes back to the fourth century AD to hold a number of [[Himyarite Kingdom|Himyarites]] believers due to the efforts of [[Theophilos the Indian]]. Currently, there are no official statistics on their numbers, but estimated at between 3,000 and 25,000 people,&lt;ref name="us"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2008/108496.htm|title=Yemen|work=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and most of them are refugees or temporary residents.

[[Freedom of worship]], conversion from Islam and establishing facilities dedicated for worship are not recognized in the Constitution or as laws or legal rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/193127.pdf|format=PDF|title=Yemen : Executive summary|website=State.gov|accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, [[Wahhabism|Wahabbi]] activities linked to [[Al-Islah (Yemen)|Al-Islah]] were being facilitated, financed and encouraged from multiple fronts including the Ministry of Endowments and Guidance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Shelagh Weir|title=A Tribal Order: Politics and Law in the Mountains of Yemen|date=2009|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=9780292773974|quote=''These activities were encouraged and financed, as elsewhere in Yemen, by the then Wahhabi-controlled Ministry of Religious Guidance (irsha ̄d), by Saudi and Yemeni business figures and by the Yemeni Reform Grouping islah''|page=296}}&lt;/ref&gt; which says that its tasks "to contribute to the development of Islamic awareness and circulation of the publication Education and Islamic morals and consolidation in the life of public and private citizens."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yemen-nic.info/ministations/section.php?SECTION_ID=452|title=وزارة الأوقاف والإرشاد|publisher=|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Missionaries of Charity, founded by [[Mother Teresa]], have worked in Aden since 1992, and the order has three other centers in [[Sana'a]], [[Taiz]] and [[Al Hudaydah|Hodeidah]]. Three Catholic nuns were killed in Hodeidah in 1998, two from India and the third from the Philippines, at the hands of a member of Al-Islah Abdullah al-Nashiri, arguing that they were calling for conversion to [[Christianity]]. In 2002, three Americans were killed in Baptists Hospital at the hands of another Al-Islah member named Abed Abdul Razak Kamel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/205561/too-deep-evan-kohlmann|title=National Review Online|author=Evan Kohlmann|date=17 January 2003|work=National Review Online|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Survivors say that the hospital was "a political football" often raised by Islamists (Al-Islah), who talked about it in mosques and hospital workers describing Hospital workers as "spies". But they emphasized that these opinions are a minority among Yemenis.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/16/world/threats-and-responses-victims-nine-bullets-that-ended-baptists-work-in-yemen.html|title=Nine Bullets That Ended Baptists' Work in Yemen|date=16 January 2003|work=The New York Times|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2015, a Catholic church in Aden was destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/gunmen-kill-16-at-retirement-home-in-aden-1457094756|title=Gunmen Kill 16 at Yemeni Home for the Elderly|author=Saleh al-Batati in Yemen and Asa Fitch in Dubai|date=6 March 2016|work=WSJ|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the escalation of the Yemeni crisis in March 2015, six priests from [[John Bosco]] remained, and twenty workers of charitable missions in the country, described by [[Pope Francis]] by the courage to fortitude amid war and conflict. He called the [[Apostolic Vicar]] of Southern Arabia to pray for all the oppressed and tortured, expelled from their homes, and killed unjustly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americamagazine.org/issue/catholics-yemen|title=Catholics in Yemen|work=America Magazine|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Missionaries of Charity were not actively engaged in [[Evangelism|evangelization]] according to the testimonies of beneficiaries of its services.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2002/12/30/three-american-missionaries-killed-in-yemen-hospital.html|title=Three American Missionaries Killed in Yemen Hospital|work=Fox News|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attack==
The attack on the house took place at 12:00pm local time, when two armed men had persuaded the guards to let them through the main gate having claimed they were going to visit their elderly mother. Once they entered, they began to shoot randomly, according to Indian officials at the Foreign Ministry.&lt;ref name="indianexpress.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/4-indian-nurses-among-16-dead-in-yemen-gun-attack-govt-verifying-reports|title=Indian nun among 16 killed by gunmen in Yemen; victims handcuffed, shot in the head|date=5 March 2016|work=The Indian Express|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inside the building, nuns were preparing breakfast. Four of the five nuns sensed danger and tried to hide in a convent, where they were shot dead in an open area. All the rooms were stormed and the meeting tent was destroyed, as were statues and crucifixes in the small church. In one picture, two nuns are shown lying on the ground in a dirt yard, after having been shot [[Capital punishment|execution-style]].

Sunita Kumar, a spokesman for the charity's mission, described the killers as "demented", adding "there is no other explanation as to why armed people would enter the premises of the home and shoot down innocent, harmless nurses who had dedicated their lives to serving others."&lt;ref name="indianexpress.com"/&gt; Bishop Michael Lewis of the Anglican Church said the compound contained seventy or eighty elderly people, many destitute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anglicannews.org/news/2016/03/prayers-offered-after-killing-of-nuns-in-yemen.aspx|title=Prayers offered after killing of nuns in Yemen|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cardinal Secretary of State]] [[Pietro Parolin]] commented that [[Pope Francis]] prayed that this pointless slaughter will awaken consciences, lead to a change of heart and inspire all parties to lay down their arms and take up the path of dialogue.&lt;ref name="qaeda"/&gt;

Pope Francis described the crime as "satanic", stating that the nuns were "martyrs of today", adding that they were killed by both the attackers, and a "globalization of indifference.".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4050">'''Morphological freedom''' refers to a proposed [[civil right]] of a [[person]] to either maintain or [[body modification|modify their own body]], on their own terms, through [[informed consent|informed, consensual]] recourse to, or refusal of, available therapeutic or enabling [[medical technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bostrom | first1 = N. | title = In Defense of Posthuman Dignity | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8519.2005.00437.x | journal = Bioethics | volume = 19 | issue = 3 | pages = 202–214 | year = 2005 | pmid =  16167401| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term may have been coined by [[transhumanist]] [[Max More]] in his 1993 article, ''Technological Self-Transformation: Expanding Personal Extropy'', where he defined it as "the ability to alter bodily form at will through technologies such as surgery, genetic engineering, nanotechnology, uploading". The term was later used by science debater [[Anders Sandberg]] as "an extension of one’s right to one’s body, not just [[self-ownership]] but also the right to modify oneself according to one’s desires."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bradshaw | first1 = H.

==Politics==
According to [[technocritic]] [[Dale Carrico]], the politics of morphological freedom imply a commitment to the value, standing, and social legibility of the widest possible variety of desired [[morphology (biology)|morphologies]] and [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]]s. More specifically, morphological freedom is an expression of [[Liberalism in the United States|liberal]] [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]], [[secularism]], [[progressivism|progressive]] [[cosmopolitanism]], and [[posthumanist]] [[multiculturalism]]s applied to the ongoing and upcoming transformation of the understanding of [[medicine|medical practice]] from one of conventional therapy to one of [[informed consent|consensual]] [[Self-Determination Theory|self-determination]], via [[human genetic engineering|genetic]], [[cyberware|prosthetic]], and [[neuropharmacology|cognitive]] modification.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

==Religion==
According to authors Calvin Mercer and Tracy J. Trothen there is tension between religion and transhumanists, particularly the [[Abrahamic]] traditions, with regards to morphological freedom. While religion generally recognizes the need to heal people and improve their situation from a medical perspective they are generally hesitant to promote a wholesale modification of the body as they see it ultimately belonging to their god.&lt;ref name="MercerTrothen2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Calvin Mercer|author2=Tracy J.

The '''noosphere''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|oʊ|.|ə|s|f|ɪər}}; sometimes '''noösphere''') is the sphere of human thought.&lt;ref&gt;Georgy S. Levit: Biogeochemistry, Biosphere, Noosphere: The Growth of the Theoretical System of Vladimir Ivanovich Vernadsky (1863-1945) {{ISBN|3-86135-351-2}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Georgy S. Levit: "[https://web.archive.org/web/20050517081543/http://www2.uni-jena.de/biologie/ehh/personal/glevit/Teilhard.pdf The Biosphere and the Noosphere Theories of V. I. Vernadsky and P. Teilhard de Chardin: A Methodological Essay]. International Archives on the History of Science/Archives Internationales D'Histoire des Sciences", 50 (144), 2000: p. 160–176}&lt;/ref&gt; The word derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] νοῦς ([[nous]] "[[mind]]") and σφαῖρα  (sphaira "[[sphere]]"), in lexical analogy to "[[Atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]]" and "[[biosphere]]".&lt;ref&gt;
"[...]he defined noosphere as the 'thinking envelope of the biosphere' and the 'conscious unity of souls'" David H. Lane, 1996, [https://books.google.com/books?id=QrwityQkdxkC "The phenomenon of Teilhard: prophet for a new age" p. 4]&lt;/ref&gt; It was introduced by [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] in 1922&lt;ref&gt;In 1922, Teilhard wrote in an essay with the title 'Hominization': "And this amounts to imagining, in one way or another, above the animal biosphere a human sphere, a sphere of reflection, of conscious invention, of conscious souls (the noosphere, if you will)" (1966, p. 63) It was a neologism employing the Greek word noos for "mind".  (Teilhard de Chardin, "Hominization" (1923), "[https://books.google.com/books?id=GnwPAQAAIAAJ The Vision of the Past]" pages 71, 230, 261)&lt;/ref&gt; in his ''[[Cosmogenesis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Tambov State Technical University: [http://www.tstu.ru/win/kultur/nauka/vernad/uchver.htm The Prominent Russian Scientist V. I. Vernadsky] (Russian)&lt;/ref&gt; Another possibility is the first use of the term by [[Édouard Le Roy]] (1870–1954), who together with Teilhard was listening to lectures of [[Vladimir Ivanovich Vernadsky]] at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]]. In 1936, Vernadsky accepted the idea of the noosphere in a letter to Boris Leonidovich Lichkov (though he states that the concept derives from Le Roy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ag-evolutionsbiologie.de/app/download/3171558102/levit_olsson_ortho.pdf "Evolution on Rails": Mechanisms and Levels of Orthogenesis by Georgy S. Levit and Lennart Olsson]&lt;/ref&gt; Citing the work of Teilhard's biographer—Rene Cuenot—Sampson and Pitt stated that although the concept was jointly developed by all three men (Vernadsky, LeRoy, and Teilhard), Teilhard believed that he actually invented the word: "I believe, so far as one can ever tell, that the word 'noosphere' was my invention: but it was he [Le Roy] who launched it."&lt;ref&gt;Cuenot, cited in Sampson &amp; Pitt, 1999, p. 4). The biosphere and noosphere reader: Global environment, society and change. New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of concept==
In the theory of [[Vladimir Ivanovich Vernadsky|Vernadsky]], the noosphere is the third in a succession of phases of development of the Earth, after the [[geosphere]] (inanimate matter) and the [[biosphere]] (biological life). Just as the emergence of life fundamentally transformed the geosphere, the emergence of human [[cognition]] fundamentally transforms the biosphere. In contrast to the conceptions of the [[Gaia hypothesis|Gaia theorists]], or the promoters of [[cyberspace]], Vernadsky's noosphere emerges at the point where humankind, through the mastery of nuclear processes, begins to create resources through the [[Nuclear transmutation|transmutation]] of elements. It is also currently being researched as part of the Princeton [[Global Consciousness Project]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://noosphere.princeton.edu/ |title=Global Consciousness Project—consciousness, group consciousness, mind |work=Noosphere.princeton.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Teilhard perceived a directionality in evolution along an axis of increasing ''Complexity/Consciousness''. For Teilhard, the noosphere is the sphere of thought encircling the earth that has emerged through evolution as a consequence of this growth in complexity / consciousness.  The noosphere is therefore as much part of nature as the barysphere, lithosphere, hydrosphere, atmosphere, and biosphere. As a result, Teilhard sees the "social phenomenon [as] the culmination of and not the attenuation of the biological phenomenon."&lt;ref&gt;P Teilhard de Chardin, (1959), ''The Phenomenon of Man'', Collins, St James Palace, London.&lt;/ref&gt; These social phenomena are part of the noosphere and include, for example, legal, educational, religious, research, industrial and technological systems. In this sense, the noosphere emerges through and is constituted by the interaction of human minds. The noosphere thus grows in step with the organization of the human mass in relation to itself as it populates the earth.  Teilhard argued the noosphere evolves towards ever greater personalisation, individuation and unification of its elements.  He saw the Christian notion of love as being the principal driver of [[noogenesis]]. Evolution would culminate in the [[Omega Point]]—an apex of thought/consciousness—which he identified with the eschatological return of Christ.

One of the original aspects of the noosphere concept deals with [[evolution]]. [[Henri Bergson]], with his ''[[Creative Evolution (book)|L'évolution créatrice]]''  (1907), was one of the first to propose evolution is "creative" and cannot necessarily be explained solely by Darwinian [[natural selection]].{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} ''L'évolution créatrice'' is upheld, according to Bergson, by a constant [[Vitalism|vital force]] which animates life and fundamentally connects mind and body, an idea opposing the dualism of [[René Descartes]]. In 1923, [[C. Lloyd Morgan]] took this work further, elaborating on an "[[emergent evolution]]" which could explain increasing [[complexity]] (including the evolution of mind). Morgan found many of the most interesting changes in living things have been largely discontinuous with past evolution. Therefore, these living things did not necessarily evolve through a gradual process of natural selection. Rather, he posited, the process of evolution experiences jumps in complexity (such as the emergence of a self-reflective universe, or noosphere). Finally, the complexification of human cultures, particularly language, facilitated a quickening of evolution in which cultural evolution occurs more rapidly than biological evolution. Recent understanding of human ecosystems and of human impact on the biosphere have led to a link between the notion of [[sustainability]] with the "co-evolution"&lt;ref&gt;Norgaard, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; and harmonization of cultural and biological evolution.

'''Austrian units of measurement''' were used in Austria until the adoption of the [[metric system]].

== History ==

In 1756, the ruling Arch duchess of Austria, [[Maria Theresa]], ordered that the Viennese ''[[klafter]]'' as well as its multiples and fractions, should be the state-defined measure of length in the Archduchy of Austria and the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. The Viennese cubit, that is 1{{frac|3|4}} of the Roman [[cubit]] (cubit's or elbow), was also used as a measure of length.

The law should also have applied to the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown]], of which Maria Theresa was queen. However, the traditional Roman foot remained in common use in [[Prague]].

When the metric system was introduced by law on 23 July 1871 (which became obligatory on 1 January 1876),&lt;ref&gt;[[History of the metric system#The German Zollverein]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=February 2017}} the length of the ''klafter'' (kl) was established as exactly 1.89648384&amp;nbsp;metres.

{{Politics|expanded=Policy}}

'''Public interest''' is "the [[welfare]] or [[well-being]] of the [[general public]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/public+interest "Public interest"], ''[[Random House Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Economist Lok Sang Ho in his ''Public Policy and the Public Interest''&lt;ref&gt;Routledge, 2012 (first published published in 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; argues that the public interest must be assessed impartially and, therefore, defines the public interest as the "''[[ex ante]]'' welfare of the representative individual." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9780415664660/ Ho, Lok Sang, Public Policy and the Public Interest, Routledge, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; Under a [[thought experiment]], by assuming that there is an equal chance for one to be anyone in society and, thus, could benefit or suffer from a change, the public interest is by definition enhanced whenever that change is preferred to the status quo ''ex ante''. This approach is "''ex ante''", in the sense that the change is not evaluated after the fact but assessed before the fact without knowing whether one would actually benefit or suffer from it.

This approach follows the "[[veil of ignorance]]" approach, which was first proposed by [[John Harsanyi]] but popularized by [[John Rawls]] in his 1971 ''Theory of Justice''.&lt;ref&gt;Rawls, John (1971) ''A Theory of Justice'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, however, the approach can be traced to [[John Stuart Mill]], who, in his letter to [[George Grote]], explained that "human happiness, even one's own, is in general more successfully pursued by acting on general rules, than by measuring the consequences of each act; and this is still more the case with the general happiness, since any other plan would not only leave everybody uncertain what to expect, but would involve perpetual quarrelling..."&lt;ref&gt;Francis E. Mineka and Dwight N. Lindley (ed.), ''The Collected Works of John Stuart Mill, Volume XIV - The Later Letters of John Stuart Mill 1849-1873 Part I, Toronto: University of Toronto Press, London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1972, Vol. XV, p.&amp;nbsp;762, 1862.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales]] argues that applying a detailed definition is likely to result in [[unintended consequences]], in [http://www.icaew.com/publicinterest Acting in the Public Interest](2012). Instead, each circumstance needs to be assessed based on criteria such as the relevant public, wants, and constraints. The key to assessing any public interest decision is transparency of the decision-making process, including balancing competing interests.

==Law==
{{main|Public interest law}}
[[File:Brandeis office 1916.jpg|thumb|Brandeis (center) in his office 1916.]]
“Public interest law” is a term that became widely adopted in the United States during and after the social turmoil of the 1960s. It built upon a tradition exemplified by [[Louis Brandeis]], who before becoming a U.S. Supreme Court justice incorporated advocacy for the interests of the general public into his legal practice. 
In a celebrated 1905 speech, Brandeis decried the legal profession, complaining that “able lawyers have to a large extent allowed themselves to become adjuncts of great corporations and have neglected their obligation to use their powers for the protection of the people.” &lt;ref&gt;Edwin Rekosh, et al.,ed. "Pursuing the Public Interest, A Handbook for Legal Professionals and Activists" (http://www.pilnet.org/component/docman/doc_download/35-pursuing-the-public-interest-a-handbook-for-legal.html); Scott L. Cummings, The Politics of Pro Bono, 52 UCLA L. Rev. 1, 13-14(2004)&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1960s and 1970s, large numbers of American law school graduates began to seek “relevance” in their work — wishing to have an effect on the social issues that were so visibly and hotly debated within American society at that time. They defined themselves as public interest lawyers in order to distinguish themselves from the “corporate adjuncts” referred to by Brandeis.&lt;ref&gt;Rekosh, supra; See also Joel F. Handler, Ellen Jane Hollingsworth &amp; Howard S. Erlanger, Lawyers and the Pursuit of Legal Rights 24-39 (1978); Note, The New Public Interest lawyers, 79 Yale L.J. 1069, 1069-70 (1970)&lt;/ref&gt;

Public interest law does not describe a body of law or a legal field; the term was adopted to describe whom the public interest lawyers were representing, rather than what matters they would work on. Instead of representing powerful economic interests, they chose to be advocates for otherwise underrepresented individuals. Consequently, a significant current in public interest lawyering has always emphasized the need to provide legal services to those living in poverty. The term has grown, however, to encompass a broader range of activities of lawyers and non-lawyers working toward a multitude of objectives, including civil rights, civil liberties, women’s rights, consumer rights, environmental protection, and so on. Nevertheless, a common denominator for public interest lawyers in the United States and in a growing number of countries remains the ethic of “fighting for the little guy”—that is, representing the underrepresented and vulnerable segments of society.&lt;ref name=Cummings&gt;Scott L. Cummings &amp; Ingrid V. Eagly, After Public Interest Law, NWU L. Rev. 1251, 1251-1259, 2075-2077(2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government==

{{globalize|date=February 2017}}

Public interest has been considered as the core of "[[democratic theories of government]]” and often paired with two other concepts, "[[convenience]]" and "[[Need|necessity]]".&lt;ref&gt;Napoli, Philip M. (2001). Foundations of Communications Policy. Principles and Process in the Regulation of Electronic Media. Cresskill, NJ: Hampton Press&lt;/ref&gt; Public interest, convenience and necessity appeared for the first time in the Transportation Act of 1920 and also appeared in the [[Radio Act of 1927]]. After that, these three concepts became critical criteria for making communication policies and solving some related disputes.

The '''quinarian system''' was a method of [[Taxonomy (biology)|zoological classification]] which was popular in the mid 19th century, especially among British naturalists. It was largely developed by the [[Entomology|entomologist]] [[William Sharp Macleay]] in 1819.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Swainson's work on [[ornithology]] gave wide publicity to the idea. The system had opponents even before the publication of [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' (1859), which paved the way for [[evolution]]ary trees.&lt;ref name=ohara&gt;{{cite book

==Classification approach==

[[Image:SwainsonQuinarian.jpg|thumb|Swainson's Quinarian structure of birds]]

Quinarianism gets its name from the emphasis on the number five: it proposed that all taxa are divisible into five subgroups, and if fewer than five subgroups were known, quinarians believed that a missing subgroup remained to be found.&lt;ref name=ohara/&gt;

[[Image:VigorsQuinarian.jpg|thumb|left|[[Nicholas Aylward Vigors]]'s Quinarian classification of birds. The missing entries represented groups that he expected remained to be discovered.]]

Presumably this arose as a chance observation of some accidental analogies between different groups, but it was erected into a guiding principle by the quinarians. It became increasingly elaborate, proposing that each group of five classes could be arranged in a circle, with those closer together having greater affinities. Typically they were depicted with relatively advanced groups at the top, and supposedly degenerate forms towards the bottom. Each circle could touch or overlap with adjacent circles; the equivalent overlapping of actual groups in nature was called osculation&lt;!--don't link to the mathematics page of this name--&gt;.

[[Image:PtilotaQuinarian.jpg|thumb|[[William John Swainson]]'s arrangement of the insects, with analogies to the vertebrates]]

Another aspect of the system was the identification of ''analogies'' across groups:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= O’Hara, Robert J. |year=1991| title=Representations of the natural system in the nineteenth century| journal= Biology and Philosophy|volume= 6| issue=2| pages=255–274| url=http://rjohara.net/cv/1991-bp.html| doi=10.1007/bf02426840}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|[W]e shall consider that to be a natural system which endeavours to explain the multifarious relations which one object bears to another, not simply in their direct affinity, by which they follow each other like the links of a vast chain, but in their more remote relations [analogies], whereby they typify or represent other objects totally distinct in structure and organization from themselves|Swainson, 1835:197&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Swainson, W.|year=1835| title= A treatise on the geography and classification of animals| publisher= Longman, London|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k97034t }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Quinarianism was not widely popular outside the United Kingdom (some followers like William Hincks persisted in Canada&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal=Journal of the History of Biology |volume=35|pages= 5–42 |year= 2002| title= Quinarianism after Darwin’s Origin: The Circular System of William Hincks| author=Coggon, Jennifer|doi=10.1023/a:1014582710287}}&lt;/ref&gt;); it became unfashionable by the 1840s, during which time more complex "maps" were made by [[Hugh Edwin Strickland]] and [[Alfred Russel Wallace]]. Strickland and others specifically rejected the use of relations of "analogy" in constructing natural classifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Strickland, H.E. |year=1841 |title= On the true method of discovering the natural system in zoology and botany| journal= Annals and Magazine of Natural History|volume= 6|pages=184–194 |url=https://archive.org/stream/annalsmagazineof06londuoft#page/184/mode/1up |doi=10.1080/03745484009443283}}&lt;/ref&gt; These systems were eventually discarded in favour of principles of genuinely natural classification, namely based on [[evolution]]ary relationship.&lt;ref name=ohara/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Panchen, Alec L. |year=1992| title=Classification, Evolution, and the Nature of Biology|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Self-affirmation''' theory is a [[psychology|psychological]] theory that focuses on how individuals adapt to information or experiences that are threatening to their [[self-concept]]. [[Claude Steele]] originally popularized self-affirmation theory in the late 1980s,&lt;ref name="Steele 1988"&gt;Steele, C. M. (1988). The psychology of self-affirmation: Sustaining the integrity of the self. Advances in experimental social psychology, 21, 261-302&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cohen 2007"&gt;Cohen, G. L., &amp; Sherman, D. K. (2007). Self-affirmation theory. In R. Baumeister and K. Vohs (Eds.), Encyclopedia of Social Psychology (pp. 787-789). Thousand Oakes: Sage Publications&lt;/ref&gt; and it remains a well-studied theory in [[Social psychology|social psychological]] research.&lt;ref name="Sherman 2006"&gt;Sherman, D. K., &amp; Cohen, G. L. (2006). The psychology of self-defense: Self-affirmation theory. In M. P. Zanna (Ed.) Advances in experimental social psychology, 38, pp. 183-242. New York, NY: Guildford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McQueen 2006"&gt;McQueen, A., &amp; Klein, W. M. (2006). Experimental manipulations of self-affirmation: A systematic review. Self and Identity, 5(4), 289-354&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-affirmation theory contends that if individuals reflect on values that are personally relevant to them, they are less likely to experience distress and react defensively when confronted with information that contradicts or threatens their sense of self.

Experimental investigations of self-affirmation theory suggest that self-affirmation can help individuals cope with threat or stress and that it might be beneficial for improving academic performance, health, and reducing defensiveness.&lt;ref name="Cohen 2014"&gt;Cohen, G. L., &amp; Sherman, D. K. (2014). The psychology of change: Self-affirmation and social psychological intervention. Annual Review of Psychology, 65, 333-371&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
There are four main principles of self-affirmation theory.

===People try to protect their self-integrity===
Self-affirmation theory proposes that individuals are driven to protect their self-integrity.&lt;ref name="Sherman 2006"/&gt; According to self-affirmation theory, self-integrity is one's concept of oneself as a good, moral person, who acts in ways that are in accord with cultural and social norms. Steele purported that the self is made up of different domains: roles, values, and belief systems.&lt;ref name="Steele 1988"/&gt; Roles include responsibilities a person has, such as being a parent, friend, student, or professional. Values are aspirations people live in accordance to, including things like living healthfully and treating others with respect. Belief systems include the ideologies to which a person ascribes, such as religious or political beliefs. Self-integrity can take many forms.&lt;ref name="Sherman 2006"/&gt; For example, self-integrity can take the form of being independent, intelligent, a helpful member of a society, part of a family, and/or part of a group. Threats against a person's self-integrity are events or messages that imply an individual is not good or adequate in a personally relevant domain. Self-affirmation theory suggests that when individuals face threat to one of these domains, they are motivated to maintain a positive global image of themselves.

===Drives to protect the sense of self are often defensive===
Self-affirmation theory purports that when individuals are faced with information that threatens their self-integrity, the response to this information is often defensive in nature.&lt;ref name="Steele 1988"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sherman 2006"/&gt;  Defensive reactions attempt to minimize the threat in order to preserve the sense of self. Examples of defensive reactions include denial, avoiding the threat, and changing one's appraisal of the event in order to make it less threatening.

===Self-integrity is flexible===
Instead of having one self-concept (e.g., I am a good parent), self-affirmation theory posits that individuals flexibly define who they are using various roles (e.g., I am a good parent, child, and worker).  Having a flexible sense of self allows individual to offset weaknesses in one domain, by highlighting the strengths in another domain.&lt;ref name="Sherman 2006"/&gt; That is, if someone perceives threat to one domain, he or she can accommodate this threat by upholding a value in another domain. Self-affirmations can come from many sources. Having a flexible self-concept allows people to adapt in the face of threat.

===Actions that promote one's values can reduce perceived threat===
It is theorized that engaging in activities that promote the values, beliefs, and roles that are central to an individual's identity can promote self-integrity.&lt;ref name="Cohen 2007"/&gt; Promoting one's values can affirm the individual and reduce the perceived threat. Engaging in such actions when facing threat serves to remind individuals of the broad, principal values by which they define themselves and their lives.&lt;ref name="Sherman 2006"/&gt; This change in perspective shifts attention away from the threat in one domain of the self toward a larger context of who they are. It is thought that when people operate from this broader perspective, they  react less defensively to the threat, which allows them to act more effectively.&lt;ref name="Sherman 2006"/&gt; Self-Affirmations can occur by both reflecting on a personally relevant value, belief, or role, as well as engaging in an activity that might evoke a personally relevant value, such as spending time with family if that is personally relevant.

Taken together, the four principles suggest that when confronted with information that threatens  self-concept, the person experiences distress and is subsequently motivated to self-defense. However, the defensive reaction can impede more adaptive ways to solve the problem (like engaging in problem-solving or changing unhealthy behaviors). It is thought that affirming an important value unrelated to the threat helps individuals to shift their perspective to their broader life context. Having a broad viewpoint diminishes the perceived threat, allowing individuals to act less defensively and more effectively.

==Paradigms used to study self-affirmation theory==
In laboratory experiments, psychologists induce self-affirmation in participants in order to investigate the influence of self-affirmation on individuals' well-being. There are two chief methods used to self-affirm  participants in experimental studies.&lt;ref name="McQueen 2006"/&gt;

===Values Essay===
One of the most common ways to induce self-affirmation is to have participants write about a personally relevant value.&lt;ref name="McQueen 2006"/&gt; In order to do this, participants rank a list of values from most important to least important to them. The list typically includes the following value domains, business, art/music/theater, social life/relationships, science/pursuit of knowledge, religion/morality, and government/politics. Participants then write about the value they ranked as most important and how it is meaningful to them for 10 minutes.

===Values List===
The Allport-Vernon-Lindzey Values Scale &lt;ref&gt;Allport, G. W., Vernon, P. E., &amp; Lindzey, G. E. (1960). Study of values: A scale for measuring the dominant interests in personality. Houghton Mifflin&lt;/ref&gt; is another measures that is administered to participants to induce self-affirmation in the laboratory.&lt;ref name="McQueen 2006"/&gt; Participants choose one of two answers after reading a statement about a value. An example item from the religion scale would be “The more important study for mankind is (a) mathematics (b) theology”.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, R. A. (1968). The interpretation of the religious scale of the Allport-Vernon-Lindzey study of values. Journal for the scientific study of religion, 65-77&lt;/ref&gt; This allows researchers to see where an individual's personal interests and values lie. It is thought that answering questions about a value domain that they find important will make that value more salient to them, resulting in self-affirmation.&lt;ref name="McQueen 2006"/&gt; There are six different value domains on the Allport-Vernon-Lindzey Values scale:  religion, theoretical, aesthetic, political, social, and economic.

==Empirical Support==
Extant empirical research demonstrates that self-affirmations can be beneficial in reducing individuals' [[Fight-or-flight response|stress response]] as well as their defensiveness toward threats.

===Self-affirmation buffering against stress===
In one study investigating the effects of self-affirmation on [[Flight-or-flight response|stress response]], undergraduate participants completed the [[Trier Social Stress Test]], a standardized laboratory paradigm used to induce stress in participants. In the Trier Social Stress task, participants are asked to give a short speech in front of a panel of judges who do not give any comments or positive feedback to the participant. Following the speech, participants must complete a mental arithmetic task, in which they count backwards from 2,083 in increments of 13 while being told by the judges to go faster. Prior to completing the Trier Social Stress Task, half of the participants completed a variation of values list self-affirmation task. Participants who completed the values list had significantly lower stress response than individuals in the control condition, as indicated by a lower [[cortisol]] response in affirmed participants compared to participants who did not complete the self-affirmation condition.&lt;ref&gt;Creswell, J. D., Welch, W. T., Taylor, S. E., Sherman, D. K., Gruenewald, T. L., &amp; Mann, T. (2005). Affirmation of personal values buffers neuroendocrine and psychological stress responses. Psychological Science, 16(11), 846-851&lt;/ref&gt;

In a different experiment, undergraduate students completed difficult problem solving puzzles in the presence of an evaluator. Participants also reported how much chronic stress they endured over the past month. Prior to completing the problem-solving puzzles half of the participants completed a values essay self-affirmation task. For the individuals who did not complete the self-affirmation task, low-stress participants performed significantly better than high-stress participants. For individuals in the self-affirmation condition, high-stress individuals performed equally as well as low-stress individuals. Findings suggest that self-affirmation buffered against the negative effects of stress on problem-solving performance.&lt;ref&gt;Creswell, J. D., Dutcher, J. M., Klein, W. M., Harris, P. R., &amp; Levine, J. M. (2013). Self-affirmation improves problem-solving under stress. PLoS ONE, 8(5), e62593&lt;/ref&gt;

For another experiment, undergraduates were recruited to participate in a research study two weeks prior to completing a mid-term exam. All participants collected urine samples for 24 hours two weeks prior to their midterm (baseline) as well as for the 24 hours prior to their midterm examination so levels their [[catecholamine]] levels could be measured. Catecholamine levels are thought to be high when individuals are experiencing higher stress.&lt;ref&gt;James, G. D., Crews, D. E., &amp; Pearson, J. (1989). Catecholamines and stress. Human population biology: a transdisciplinary science, 280-95&lt;/ref&gt; Half of participants completed two values essays in the two weeks leading up to their midterm examination. Participants who did not complete the self-affirmation condition demonstrated increased catecholamine response from baseline to their midterm exam. However, participants who completed the two values essays did not show an increase in catecholamine levels from baseline to their midterm.&lt;ref&gt;Sherman, D. K., Bunyan, D. P., Creswell, J. D., &amp; Jaremka, L. M. (2009). Psychological vulnerability and stress: the effects of self-affirmation on sympathetic nervous system responses to naturalistic stressors. Health Psychology, 28(5), 554&lt;/ref&gt;

Preliminary research results suggest that self-affirmation can protect against the negative consequences of stress.&lt;ref name="Cohen 2014"/&gt; More research is needed to understand ''how'' self-affirmations decrease stress responses.

===Self-affirmation reducing defensiveness===

Results from studies provide support for the idea that when individuals complete an activity that affirms their self-integrity they are less defensive and more accepting of information that is potentially threatening. However, more research is needed to better understand ''why'' people are more open-minded after they have completed an affirmation task.&lt;ref name="Sherman 2006"/&gt;

==Applications==

===Education===
Studies have examined the effects of self-affirmation on the academic performance of historically marginalized groups such as African American and Latino American students, who face a multitude of daily threats in the school environment.&lt;ref&gt;Steele CM. 2010. Whistling Vivaldi and Other Clues to How Stereotypes Affect Us. New York: Norton&lt;/ref&gt; Seventh grade students took part in a two-year study. Half of the students completed a values essay about their most important value approximately seven to eight times over the course of two academic years, while the other half wrote a values essay about why their least important value might be of value to someone else. The study tracked the students' grades for three years. Ethnic minority students in the self-affirmation condition received higher grade point averages than the ethnic minority students who wrote about why their least important value might be important to someone else. There was no effect of self-affirmation in white students. Findings suggest that for students who face daily, repeated stressors at school, self-affirmation buffers against worsening school performance.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, G. L., Garcia, J., Apfel, N., &amp; Master, A. (2006). [http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs375/fa13/cs375/Science-2006-Cohen-1307-10.pdf Reducing the racial achievement gap: A social-psychological intervention]. Science, 313(5791), 1307-1310&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, G. L., Garcia, J., Purdie-Vaughns, V., Apfel, N., &amp; Brzustoski, P. (2009). [https://ed.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/recursive_processes_final_science.pdf Recursive processes in self-affirmation: Intervening to close the minority achievement gap]. science, 324(5925), 400-403&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, values affirmation decreased the achievement gap for college students from low socioeconomic status&lt;ref&gt;Bowen NK, Wegmann KM, Webber KC. 2013. Enhancing a brief writing intervention to combat stereotype threat among middle-school students. Journal of Education Psychology 105:427–35&lt;/ref&gt; and for women in introductory physics courses.&lt;ref&gt;Miyake A, Kost-Smith LE, Finkelstein ND, Pollock SJ, Cohen GL, Ito TA. 2010. Reducing the gender achievement gap in college science: a classroom study of values affirmation. Science 330:1234–37&lt;/ref&gt; These findings suggest that self-affirmation can have a buffering effect on academic achievement for groups who face the most threat.

===Health===
Women concerned with their weight were recruited for a study. Concern with weight has similar effects of stress in that it can cause psychological distress, poor eating, and weight gain.&lt;ref&gt;Haines J, Neumark-Sztainer D, Wall M, Story M. 2007. Personal, behavioral, and environmental risk and protective factors for adolescent overweight. Obesity 15:2748–60&lt;/ref&gt; Half of the women completed a values essay. Self-affirmed participants had lost more weight, had lower [[body mass index]], and smaller waist circumference than non-affirmed women.&lt;ref&gt;Logel C, Cohen GL. 2012. The role of the self in physical health. Psychological Science. 23:53–55&lt;/ref&gt;

Patients with end stage [[Nephropathy|renal disease]] participated in a study assessing the effects of self-affirmation on adherence to [[phosphate binder]]s that facilitate control of phosphate levels. Poor phosphate control in this population can be dangerous and life-threatening.  There was a significant improvement in serum phosphate levels for the affirmed patients compared to the non-affirmed patients, suggesting better adherence to phosphate binders.&lt;ref&gt;Wileman, V., Farrington, K., Chilcot, J., Norton, S., Wellsted, D. M., Almond, M. K., ... &amp; Armitage, C. J. (2014). Evidence That Self-Affirmation Improves Phosphate Control in Hemodialysis Patients: A Pilot Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial. Annals of Behavioral Medicine, 1-7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Factors that influence the effectiveness of self-affirmations==

===Culture===
[[Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory|Individualist and collectivist cultures]] place different levels of importance on belonging to in-groups, and it is thought that this may vary the effects of self-affirmation.&lt;ref name="Sherman 2006"/&gt; One study investigated the effects of self-affirmation on reducing [[cognitive dissonance]]. This study found that self-affirmed participants from individualist cultures saw reductions in cognitive dissonance, whereas self-affirmed participants from collectivist cultures did not experience a reduction in cognitive dissonance.&lt;ref&gt;Heine, S. J., &amp; Lehman, D. R. (1997). Culture, dissonance, and self-affirmation. Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 23, 389-400&lt;/ref&gt; Another study examined the effect on individuals from individualist and collectivist backgrounds of writing a values essay about a value that was important to the participant compared to a value that was important to the participant's family. The authors found reduced [[cognitive dissonance]] for participants from collectivist cultures who wrote about values important to them and their families, and found reduced cognitive dissonance for participants from individualist cultures who wrote about a value important to just them.&lt;ref&gt;Hoshino-Browne, E., Zanna, A. S., Spencer, S. J., &amp; Zanna, M. P. (2004). Investigating attitudes cross-culturally: A case of cognitive dissonance among East Asians and North Americans. In G. Haddock &amp; G. R. Maio (Eds.), Contemporary perspectives on the psychology of attitudes (pp. 375-397). New York: Psychology Press&lt;/ref&gt;

===Importance of the threatened domain===
Benefits from self-affirmation are thought to primarily occur when the perceived threat is in an area of importance to the individual.&lt;ref name="Sherman 2006"/&gt; For example, in the experiment detailed above in which coffee drinkers read an article about caffeine consumption and increased risk of breast cancer, self-affirmation only reduced defensiveness in individuals who were heavy coffee drinkers and not in occasional coffee drinkers.&lt;ref name="Sherman 2000"&gt;Sherman, D. A., Nelson, L. D., &amp; Steele, C. M. (2000). Do messages about health risks threaten the self? Increasing the acceptance of threatening health messages via self-affirmation. Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 26(9), 1046-1058&lt;/ref&gt; Because an article on the risks associated with caffeine consumption might not pose the same threat to occasional coffee drinkers as to heavy coffee drinkers, self-affirmation likely does not provide the same benefit for occasional coffee drinkers. Thus, the importance of the threatened domain to one's self-integrity is thought to influence the effectiveness of self-affirmations.

==Factors underlying the effects of self-affirmation theory==
Research has not yet identified the underlying mechanisms of how self-affirmation buffers against stress and reduces defensiveness. However, it is believed that there is not just one factor responsible for the effects of self-affirmation, but rather many.&lt;ref name="Sherman 2006"/&gt; To date, increasing positive emotions and self-esteem have been investigated as mechanisms of self-affirmation, but the findings are mixed. Some studies have found that positive mood brings about similar reductions in defensiveness as self-affirmations.&lt;ref&gt;Koole, S. L., Smeets, K., Van Knippenberg, A., &amp; Dijksterhuis, A. (1999). The cessation of rumination through self-affirmation. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 77(1), 111&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Raghunathan, R., &amp; Trope, Y. (2002). Walking the tightrope between feeling good and being accurate: mood as a resource in processing persuasive messages. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 83(3), 510&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, several studies fail to detect any effect of self-affirmation on mood, suggesting self-affirmation does not operate via increases in positive mood.&lt;ref name="Sherman 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steele, C. M., Spencer, S. J., &amp; Lynch, M. (1993). Self-image resilience and dissonance: the role of affirmational resources. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 64(6), 885&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, results on the effects of self-affirmation on self-esteem are also mixed. Some studies have observed increases in self-esteem following self-affirmation,&lt;ref&gt;Fein, S., &amp; Spencer, S. J. (1997). Prejudice as self-image maintenance: Affirming the self through derogating others. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 73(1), 31&lt;/ref&gt; whereas other have found no effect on self-esteem.&lt;ref&gt;Schmeichel, B. J., &amp; Martens, A. (2005). Self-affirmation and mortality salience: Affirming values reduces worldview defense and death-thought accessibility. Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 31(5), 658-667&lt;/ref&gt; More research is needed to better understand ''how'' self-affirmation can provide benefit to individuals.

The idea of '''self-parenting''' is that a person's "[[mind]]" is created in the form of a [[conversation]] between two voices generated by the two parts of the [[cerebral hemisphere]]. One is the "inner [[parent]]" represented by the [[left brain]] with the other voice being the "inner [[child]]" represented by the [[right brain]]. The manner and quality by which these "inner conversations" take place between the two voices is most accurately described as self-parenting. The inner parent is parenting the inner child within the inner conversations.

Another way of seeing self-parenting through a different perspective is first off knowing that usually some individuals are not strong when it comes to dealing with problems with their inner self; they usually need a mentor with positive feedback, there to guide them with certain strategies and most of all to overcome obstacles. Most of the time when they are in need to dealing with the forces of reality, they may place too much pressure on certain people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://selfparenting.com/booksmodulesconsultations-middle-page/support-groups/ |title=Self-Parenting Support Groups &amp;#124; Welcome to the Official SELF-PARENTING Program Website |publisher=Selfparenting.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The individual quality of a person's self-parenting style is said to closely resemble the specific style of parenting he or she received growing up as child.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5972">In [[category theory]], a branch of [[mathematics]], a '''sieve''' is a way of choosing arrows with a common [[codomain]].  It is a categorical analogue of a collection of open subsets of a fixed [[open set]] in [[topology]].  In a [[Grothendieck topology]], certain sieves become categorical analogues of [[open cover]]s in [[topology]]. Sieves were introduced by {{harvtxt|Giraud|1964}} in order to reformulate the notion of a Grothendieck topology.

==Definition==
Let '''C''' be a [[Category (mathematics)|category]], and let ''c'' be an object of '''C'''.  A '''sieve''' ''S'' on ''c'' is a [[subfunctor]] of Hom(&amp;minus;, ''c''), i.e., for all objects ''c''&amp;prime; of '''C''', ''S''(''c''&amp;prime;) ⊆ Hom(''c''&amp;prime;, ''c''), and for all arrows ''f'':''c''&amp;Prime;→''c''&amp;prime;, ''S''(''f'') is the restriction of Hom(''f'', ''c''), the [[pullback]] by ''f'' (in the sense of precomposition, not of fiber products), to ''S''(''c''&amp;prime;).

Put another way, a sieve is a collection ''S'' of arrows with a common codomain which satisfies the functoriality condition, "If ''g'':''c''&amp;prime;&amp;rarr;''c'' is an arrow in ''S'', and if ''f'':''c''&amp;Prime;&amp;rarr;''c''&amp;prime; is any other arrow in '''C''', then the pullback {{nowrap|''S''(''f'')(''g'') {{=}} ''gf''}} is in ''S''."  Consequently sieves are similar to right [[Ideal (ring theory)|ideal]]s in [[ring theory]] or [[filter (mathematics)|filter]]s in [[order theory]].

==Pullback of sieves==
The most common operation on a sieve is ''pullback''.  Pulling back a sieve ''S'' on ''c'' by an arrow ''f'':''c''&amp;prime;→''c'' gives a new sieve ''f''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''S'' on ''c''&amp;prime;.  This new sieve consists of all the arrows in ''S'' which factor through ''c''&amp;prime;.

There are several equivalent ways of defining ''f''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''S''.  The simplest is:

:For any object ''d'' of '''C''', ''f''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''S''(''d'') = { ''g'':''d''&amp;rarr;''c''&amp;prime; | fg &amp;isin; ''S''(''d'')}

A more abstract formulation is:

:''f''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''S'' is the image of the [[fibered product]] ''S''×&lt;sub&gt;Hom(&amp;minus;, ''c'')&lt;/sub&gt;Hom(&amp;minus;, ''c''&amp;prime;) under the natural projection ''S''×&lt;sub&gt;Hom(&amp;minus;, ''c'')&lt;/sub&gt;Hom(&amp;minus;, ''c''&amp;prime;)&amp;rarr;Hom(&amp;minus;, ''c''&amp;prime;).

Here the map Hom(&amp;minus;, ''c''&amp;prime;)→Hom(&amp;minus;, ''c'') is Hom(''f'', ''c''&amp;prime;), the pullback by ''f''.

The latter formulation suggests that we can also take the image of ''S''×&lt;sub&gt;Hom(&amp;minus;, ''c'')&lt;/sub&gt;Hom(&amp;minus;, ''c''&amp;prime;) under the natural map to Hom(&amp;minus;, ''c'').  This will be the image of ''f''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''S'' under composition with ''f''.  For each object ''d'' of '''C''', this sieve will consist of all arrows ''fg'', where ''g'':''d''→''c''&amp;prime; is an arrow of ''f''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''S''(''d'').  In other words, it consists of all arrows in ''S'' that can be factored through ''f''.

If we denote by &amp;empty;&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt; the empty sieve on ''c'', that is, the sieve for which &amp;empty;(''d'') is always the empty set, then for any ''f'':''c''&amp;prime;→''c'', ''f''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;empty;&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt; is &amp;empty;&lt;sub&gt;''c''&amp;prime;&lt;/sub&gt;.  Furthermore, ''f''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;Hom(&amp;minus;, ''c'') = Hom(&amp;minus;, ''c''&amp;prime;).

==Properties of sieves==
Let ''S'' and ''S''&amp;prime; be two sieves on ''c''.  We say that ''S'' ⊆ ''S''&amp;prime; if for all objects ''c''&amp;prime; of '''C''', ''S''(''c''&amp;prime;) ⊆ ''S''&amp;prime;(''c''&amp;prime;).  For all objects ''d'' of '''C''', we define (''S'' ∪ ''S''&amp;prime;)(''d'') to be ''S''(''d'') ∪ ''S''&amp;prime;(''d'') and (''S'' ∩ ''S''&amp;prime;)(''d'') to be ''S''(''d'') ∩ ''S''&amp;prime;(''d'').  We can clearly extend this definition to infinite unions and intersections as well.

If we define Sieve&lt;sub&gt;'''C'''&lt;/sub&gt;(''c'') (or Sieve(''c'') for short) to be the set of all sieves on ''c'', then Sieve(''c'') becomes a partially ordered under ⊆.  It is easy to see from the definition that the union or intersection of any family of sieves on ''c'' is a sieve on ''c'', so Sieve(''c'') is a [[complete lattice]].

A [[Grothendieck topology]] is a collection of sieves subject to certain properties.  These sieves are called ''covering sieves''.  The set of all covering sieves on an object ''c'' is a subset ''J''(''c'') of Sieve(''c'').  ''J''(''c'') satisfies several properties in addition to those required by the definition:

*If ''S'' and ''S''&amp;prime; are sieves on ''c'', ''S'' ⊆ ''S''&amp;prime;, and ''S'' ∈ ''J''(''c''), then ''S''&amp;prime; ∈ ''J''(''c'').
*Finite intersections of elements of ''J''(''c'') are in ''J''(''c'').

Consequently, ''J''(''c'') is also a [[distributive lattice]], and it is [[cofinal (mathematics)|cofinal]] in Sieve(''c'').

A '''strangelet''' is a [[hypothetical particle]] consisting of a [[bound state]] of roughly equal numbers of [[up quark|up]], [[down quark|down]], and [[strange quark|strange]] [[quark]]s. An equivalent description is that a strangelet is a small fragment of [[strange matter]], small enough to be considered a particle. The size of an object composed of strange matter could, theoretically, range from a few [[Fermi (unit)|femtometers]] across (with the mass of a light nucleus) to arbitrarily large. Once the size becomes macroscopic (on the order of metres across), such an object is usually called a [[strange star]]. The term "strangelet" originates with Edward Farhi and [[Robert Jaffe|R. L. Jaffe]].&lt;ref name = 'Farhi and Jaffe'&gt;E. Farhi and R. Jaffe, "Strange Matter", [http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PRD/v30/i11/p2379_1 Phys. Rev. D30, 2379 (1984)]&lt;/ref&gt; Strangelets have been suggested as a [[dark matter]] candidate.&lt;ref name='Witten'/&gt;

==Theoretical possibility==

===Strange matter hypothesis===
The known particles with strange quarks are unstable because the strange quark is heavier than the up and down quarks, so strange particles, such as the [[Lambda baryon|Lambda particle]], which contains an up, down, and strange quark, always lose their strangeness, by decaying via the [[weak interaction]] to lighter particles containing only up and down quarks. But states with a larger number of quarks might not suffer from this instability. This is the "strange matter hypothesis" of Bodmer &lt;ref name='Bodmer'&gt;A. Bodmer "Collapsed Nuclei" [http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PRD/v4/i6/p1601_1 Phys. Rev. D4, 1601 (1971)]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Edward Witten|Witten]].&lt;ref name='Witten'&gt;E. Witten, "Cosmic Separation Of Phases" [http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PRD/v30/i2/p272_1 Phys. Rev. D30, 272 (1984)]&lt;/ref&gt; According to this hypothesis, when a large enough number of quarks are collected together, the lowest energy state is one which has roughly equal numbers of up, down, and strange quarks, namely a strangelet. This stability would occur because of the [[Pauli exclusion principle]]; having three types of quarks, rather than two as in normal nuclear matter, allows more quarks to be placed in lower energy levels.

===Relationship with nuclei===
A nucleus is a collection of a large number of up and down quarks, confined into triplets ([[neutron]]s and [[proton]]s). According to the strange matter hypothesis, strangelets are more stable than nuclei, so nuclei are expected to decay into strangelets. But this process may be extremely slow because there is a large energy barrier to overcome: as the weak interaction starts making a nucleus into a strangelet, the first few strange quarks form strange baryons, such as the Lambda, which are heavy. Only if many conversions occur almost simultaneously will the number of strange quarks reach the critical proportion required to achieve a lower energy state. This is very unlikely to happen, so even if the strange matter hypothesis were correct, nuclei would never be seen to decay to strangelets because their lifetime would be longer than the age of the universe. {{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

===Size===
The stability of strangelets depends on their size. This is because of (a) surface tension at the interface between quark matter and vacuum (which affects small strangelets more than big ones), and (b) screening of charges, which allows small strangelets to be charged, with a neutralizing cloud of electrons/positrons around them, but requires large strangelets, like any large piece of matter, to be electrically neutral in their interior. The charge screening distance tends to be of the order of a few femtometers, so only the outer few femtometers of a strangelet can carry charge.&lt;ref&gt;H. Heiselberg, "Screening in quark droplets", [http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PRD/v48/i3/p1418_1 Phys. Rev. D48, 1418 (1993)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The surface tension of strange matter is unknown. If it is smaller than a critical value (a few MeV per square femtometer&lt;ref name='screen'&gt;M. Alford, K. Rajagopal, S. Reddy, A. Steiner, "The Stability of Strange Star Crusts and Strangelets", Phys. Rev. D73 114016 (2006) [https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0604134 arXiv:hep-ph/0604134]&lt;/ref&gt;) then large strangelets are unstable and will tend to fission into smaller strangelets (strange stars would still be stabilized by gravity). If it is larger than the critical value, then strangelets become more stable as they get bigger.

==Natural or artificial occurrence==
Although nuclei do not decay to strangelets, there are other ways to create strangelets, so if the strange matter hypothesis is correct there should be strangelets in the universe. There are at least three ways they might be created in nature:

* Cosmogonically, i.e. in the early universe when the [[Quantum chromodynamics|QCD]] confinement phase transition occurred. It is possible that strangelets were created along with the neutrons and protons that form ordinary matter.
* High-energy processes. The universe is full of very high-energy particles ([[cosmic ray]]s). It is possible that when these collide with each other or with neutron stars they may provide enough energy to overcome the energy barrier and create strangelets from nuclear matter. Some identified exotic cosmic ray events, like the [[Price's event]] with very low charge-to-mass ratio could have already registered strangelets.&lt;ref&gt;Shibaji Banerjee, Sanjay K. Ghosh, Sibaji Raha, and Debapriyo Syam, "Can Cosmic Strangelets Reach the Earth?", [http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.85.1384 Phys. Rev. Lett. 85, 1384 – Published 14 August 2000, https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0006286]&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Cosmic ray impacts. In addition to head-on collisions of cosmic rays, [[ultra high energy cosmic ray]]s impacting on [[Earth's atmosphere]] may create strangelets.

These scenarios offer possibilities for observing strangelets. If there are strangelets flying around the universe, then occasionally a strangelet should hit Earth, where it would appear as an exotic type of cosmic ray. If strangelets can be produced in high-energy collisions, then we might make them at heavy-ion colliders.

===Accelerator production===
At heavy ion accelerators like the [[Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider]] (RHIC), nuclei are collided at relativistic speeds, creating strange and antistrange quarks that could conceivably lead to strangelet production. The experimental signature of a strangelet would be its very high ratio of mass to charge, which would cause its trajectory in a magnetic field to be very nearly, but not quite, straight. The [[STAR detector|STAR collaboration]] has searched for strangelets produced at the RHIC,&lt;ref&gt;STAR Collaboration, "Strangelet search at RHIC", [http://www.arxiv.org/abs/nucl-ex/0511047 arXiv:nucl-ex/0511047]&lt;/ref&gt; but none were found. The [[Large Hadron Collider]] (LHC) is even less likely to produce strangelets,&lt;ref name="LSAGreport"&gt;Ellis J, Giudice G, Mangano ML, Tkachev I, Wiedemann U (LHC Safety Assessment Group) (5 September 2008). "[http://www.iop.org/EJ/article/0954-3899/35/11/115004/g8_11_115004.pdf?request-id=1973667e-34da-47a4-b75a-08624558a81b Review of the Safety of LHC Collisions]" (PDF, 586 [[KiB]]).

[http://cdsweb.cern.ch/record/1111112?ln=fr CERN record].&lt;/ref&gt; but searches are planned&lt;ref&gt;A.

Nucl. 67:396-405 (2004) {{arXiv|nucl-th/0301003}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the LHC [[ALICE: A Large Ion Collider Experiment|ALICE]] detector.

===Space-based detection===
The [[Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer]] (AMS), an instrument that is mounted on the [[International Space Station]], could detect strangelets.&lt;ref&gt;J. Sandweiss, "Overview of strangelet searches and Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer: When will we stop searching?" [http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0954-3899/30/1/004 J. Phys. G30:S51-S59 (2004)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Possible seismic detection===
In May 2002, a group of researchers at [[Southern Methodist University]] reported the possibility that strangelets may have been responsible for seismic events recorded on October 22 and November 24 in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;D. Anderson ''et al.'', "Two seismic events with the properties for the passage of strange quark matter through the earth" [http://www.arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0205089 arXiv:astro-ph/0205089]&lt;/ref&gt; The authors later retracted their claim, after finding that the clock of one of the seismic stations had a large error during the relevant period.&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0505584 E.T. Herrin ''et al.'', "Seismic Search for Strange Quark Nuggets"]&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that the [[Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization#International Monitoring System|International Monitoring System]] being set up to verify the [[Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty|Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty]] (CTBT) after entry into force may be useful as a sort of "strangelet observatory" using the entire Earth as its detector. The IMS will be designed to detect anomalous seismic disturbances down to {{convert|1|ktonTNT|lk=on}} energy release or less, and could be able to track strangelets passing through Earth in real time if properly exploited.

===Impacts on Solar System bodies===
It has been suggested that strangelets of subplanetary i.e. heavy meteorite mass, would puncture planets and other solar system objects, leading to impact (exit) craters which show characteristic features.&lt;ref&gt;Lance Labun, Jeremey Birrell, Johann Rafelski, "Solar System Signatures of Impacts by Compact Ultra Dense Objects",{{arxiv|1104.4572}}[http://inspirehep.net/record/897105]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dangers==
If the strange matter hypothesis is correct ''and'' a stable negatively-charged strangelet with a surface tension larger than the aforementioned critical value exists, then a larger strangelet would be more stable than a smaller one. One speculation that has resulted from the idea is that a strangelet coming into contact with a lump of ordinary matter could convert the ordinary matter to strange matter.&lt;ref name='DDH'/&gt;&lt;ref name='BJSW'/&gt;&lt;!-- original suggestion may have been Glashow and De Rujula in Nature--&gt; This "[[ice-nine]]"-like disaster scenario is as follows: one strangelet hits a nucleus, catalyzing its immediate conversion to strange matter. This liberates energy, producing a larger, more stable strangelet, which in turn hits another nucleus, catalyzing its conversion to strange matter. In the end, all the nuclei of all the atoms of Earth are converted, and Earth is reduced to a hot, large lump of strange matter. 

This is not a concern for strangelets in cosmic rays because they are produced far from Earth and have had time to decay to their ground state, which is predicted by most models to be positively charged, so they are electrostatically repelled by nuclei, and would rarely merge with them.&lt;ref&gt;J. Madsen, "Intermediate mass strangelets are positively charged", Phys. Rev. Lett. 85 (2000) 4687-4690 (2000) [http://www.arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0008217 arXiv:hep-ph/0008217]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Madsen "Strangelets in Cosmic Rays", for Proceedings of 11th Marcel Grossmann Meeting, Germany, Jul 2006, [http://www.arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0612784 arXiv:astro-ph/0612784]&lt;/ref&gt; But high-energy collisions could produce negatively charged strangelet states which live long enough to interact with the nuclei of ordinary matter.&lt;ref&gt;J. Schaffner-Bielich, C. Greiner, A. Diener, H. Stoecker, "Detectability of strange matter in heavy ion experiments", Phys. Rev. C55:3038-3046 (1997), [https://arxiv.org/abs/nucl-th/9611052 arXiv:nucl-th/9611052]&lt;/ref&gt;

The danger of catalyzed conversion by strangelets produced in heavy-ion colliders has received some media attention,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebirdman.org/Index/Others/Others-Doc-Science&amp;Forteana/+Doc-Science-Astronomy&amp;Cosmology&amp;EarthScience/CouldScientistsCreateABlackHole.htm New Scientist, 28 August 1999: "A Black Hole Ate My Planet"] &lt;!-- ORIGINALLY: http://www.kressworks.com/Science/A_black_hole_ate_my_planet.htm --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[End Day|''Horizon: End Days'']], an episode of the [[BBC]] [[television series]] [[Horizon (BBC TV series)|''Horizon'']]&lt;/ref&gt; and concerns of this type were raised&lt;ref name='DDH'&gt;A. Dar, A. De Rujula, U. Heinz, "Will relativistic heavy ion colliders destroy our planet?", Phys. Lett. B470:142-148 (1999) [http://www.arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/9910471 arXiv:hep-ph/9910471]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. Wagner, "Black holes at Brookhaven?" and reply by F. Wilzcek, Letters to the Editor, Scientific American July 1999&lt;/ref&gt; at the commencement of the RHIC experiment at Brookhaven, which could potentially have created strangelets.

Phys.72:1125-1140 (2000) [http://www.arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/9910333 arXiv:hep-ph/9910333]&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that the RHIC collisions were comparable to ones which naturally occur as cosmic rays traverse the solar system, so we would already have seen such a disaster if it were possible. RHIC has been operating since 2000 without incident. Similar concerns have been raised about the operation of the LHC at [[CERN]]&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;Dennis Overbye, Asking a Judge to Save the World, and Maybe a Whole Lot More, NY Times, 29 March 2008 [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/29/science/29collider.html?ref=us]&lt;/ref&gt; but such fears are dismissed as far-fetched by scientists.&lt;ref name='NYT'/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://public.web.cern.ch/Public/en/LHC/Safety-en.html|title=Safety at the LHC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Blaizot ''et al.'', "Study of Potentially Dangerous Events During Heavy-Ion Collisions at the LHC", [http://cdsweb.cern.ch/search?sysno=002372601cer CERN library record] [https://web.archive.org/web/20080907004852/http://doc.cern.ch/yellowrep/2003/2003-001/p1.pdf CERN Yellow Reports Server (PDF)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of a [[neutron star]], the conversion scenario seems much more plausible. A neutron star is in a sense a giant nucleus (20&amp;nbsp;km across), held together by gravity, but it is electrically neutral and so does not electrostatically repel strangelets. If a strangelet hit a neutron star, it could convert a small region of it, and that region would grow to consume the entire star, creating a [[quark star]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last-author-amp=yes|journal=Astrophys. J.|volume=310|page=261|date=1986|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1986ApJ...310..261A|doi=10.1086/164679|title=Strange stars|last1=Alcock|first1=Charles|last2=Farhi|first2=Edward|last3=Olinto|first3=Angela|bibcode = 1986ApJ...310..261A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debate about the strange matter hypothesis==
The strange matter hypothesis remains unproven. No direct search for strangelets in cosmic rays or particle accelerators has seen a strangelet (see references in earlier sections). If any of the objects such as neutron stars could be shown to have a surface made of strange matter, this would indicate that strange matter is stable at zero pressure, which would vindicate the strange matter hypothesis. However there is no strong evidence for strange matter surfaces on neutron stars (see below).

Another argument against the hypothesis is that if it were true, all neutron stars should be made of strange matter, and otherwise none should be.&lt;ref&gt;J. Friedman and R. Caldwell, "Evidence against a strange ground state for baryons", Phys. Lett. B264, 143-148 (1991)&lt;/ref&gt; Even if there were only a few strange stars initially, violent events such as collisions would soon create many strangelets flying around the universe. Because a single strangelet will convert a neutron star to strange matter, by now all neutron stars would have been converted. This argument is still debated,&lt;ref&gt;J. Madsen, "Strangelets as cosmic rays beyond the GZK-cutoff", Phys. Rev. Lett. 90:121102 (2003) [http://www.arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0211597 arXiv:stro-ph/0211597]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. Balberg, "Comment on 'strangelets as cosmic rays beyond the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin cutoff'", Phys. Rev. Lett. 92:119001 (2004), [http://www.arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0403503 arXiv:astro-ph/0403503]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Madsen, "Reply to Comment on Strangelets as Cosmic Rays beyond the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin Cutoff", Phys. Rev.Lett. 92:119002 (2004), [http://www.arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0403515 arXiv:astro-ph/0403515]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Madsen, "Strangelet propagation and cosmic ray flux", Phys. Rev. D71, 014026 (2005) [http://www.arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0411538 arXiv:astro-ph/0411538]&lt;/ref&gt; but if it is correct then showing that one neutron star has a conventional nuclear matter crust would disprove the strange matter hypothesis.

Because of its importance for the strange matter hypothesis, there is an ongoing effort to determine whether the surfaces of neutron stars are made of strange matter or nuclear matter. The evidence currently favors nuclear matter. This comes from the phenomenology of [[X-ray burst]]s, which is well explained in terms of a nuclear matter crust,&lt;ref&gt;A. Heger, A. Cumming, D. Galloway, S. Woosley, "Models of Type I X-ray Bursts from GS 1826-24: A Probe of rp-Process Hydrogen Burning", [https://arxiv.org/abs/0711.1195 arXiv:0711.1195]&lt;/ref&gt; and from measurement of seismic vibrations in [[magnetar]]s.&lt;ref&gt;A. Watts and S. Reddy, "Magnetar oscillations pose challenges for strange stars", MNRAS, 379, L63 (2007) [https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0609364 arXiv:astro-ph/0609364]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[tensor product]] of [[quadratic form]]s''' is most easily understood when one views the quadratic forms as ''[[quadratic space]]s''. If ''R'' is a commutative ring where ''2'' is invertible, and if &lt;math&gt;(V_1, q_1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(V_2,q_2)&lt;/math&gt; are two quadratic spaces over ''R'', then their tensor product &lt;math&gt;(V_1 \otimes V_2, q_1 \otimes q_2)&lt;/math&gt; is the quadratic space whose underlying ''R''-module is the [[Tensor product of modules|tensor product]] &lt;math&gt;V_1 \otimes V_2&lt;/math&gt; of ''R''-modules and whose quadratic form is the quadratic form associated to the tensor product of the bilinear forms associated to &lt;math&gt;q_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q_2&lt;/math&gt;.

In particular, the form &lt;math&gt;q_1 \otimes q_2&lt;/math&gt; satisfies

:&lt;math&gt; (q_1\otimes q_2)(v_1 \otimes v_2) = q_1(v_1) q_2(v_2) \quad \forall v_1 \in V_1,\ v_2 \in V_2&lt;/math&gt;

(which does uniquely characterize it however). It follow from this that if we have diagonalizations of our quadratic forms (which is always possible if &lt;math&gt;2 \in R&lt;/math&gt; is invertible) such that 

:&lt;math&gt;q_1 \cong \langle a_1, ... , a_n \rangle&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;q_2 \cong \langle b_1, ... , b_m \rangle&lt;/math&gt;

then the tensor product has diagonalization

:&lt;math&gt;q_1 \otimes q_2 \cong \langle a_1b_1, a_1b_2, ... a_1b_m, a_2b_1, ... , a_2b_m , ... , a_nb_1, ... a_nb_m \rangle.&lt;/math&gt;

'''Transformed cladistics''', also known as '''pattern cladistics''' is an epistemological approach to the [[cladistic]] method of phylogenetic inference and classification that makes no a priori assumptions about [[common ancestry]].  It was advocated by [[Norman Platnick]], [[Colin Patterson (biologist)|Colin Patterson]], Ronald Brady and others in the 1980s, but has few modern proponents.  The book, ''Foundations of Systematics and Biogeography''&lt;ref&gt;Williams, D. M. and M. C. Ebach. 2008. ''Foundations of Systematics and Biogeography''. Springer Science+Business Media, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; by David Williams and Malte Ebach provides a thoughtful history of the origins of this point of view.

==Patterns vs. processes==

The traditional approach to cladistics, which traces back to [[Willi Hennig]] &lt;ref&gt;Hennig, W. 1950. Grundzüge einer Theorie der phylogenetischen Systematik. Deutscher Zentralverlag, Berlin.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hennig, W. 1966. Phylogenetic systematics. University of Illinois Press, Urbana, IL.
&lt;/ref&gt;, groups together organisms based on whether or not they share derived characters or character states that are assumed to be descended from a common ancestor. Transformed cladists maintain that the assumption of [[common descent]] is uninformative and/or potentially misleading, and that therefore cladistic methods should be free from evolutionary process assumptions, and based only on [[Occam's razor|parsimonious]] interpretation of empirical data: 

{{Quote|"If classifications (that is, our knowledge of patterns) are ever to provide an adequate test of theories of evolutionary processes their construction must be independent of any particular theory of process." (Platnick, 1979)&lt;ref&gt;Platnick, N. I. (1979). "Philosophy and the transformation of cladistics". ''Systematic Zoology''. 28: 537–546.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In other words, pattern cladists argue that the fewer evolutionary assumptions a classification presupposes, the fewer errors creep in, and greater transparency results. They draw a distinction between patterns, which are observed, and processes, which may be inferred from patterns, but which should not be presupposed. Before the emergence of cladistics as a school, [[Joseph Henry Woodger]] criticized phylogenetic systematics on the grounds that homology by way of common ancestry is "putting the cart before the horse, because descent from a common ancestor is something assumed, not observed. It belongs to theory, whereas morphological correspondence is observed." &lt;ref&gt;Woodger, S. (1945). “On Biological Transformations”. In: ''Essays on Growth and Form''. Le Gros Clark, W. E., Medawar, P. B (eds.). Oxford: Clarendon Press.&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Colin Patterson (biologist)|Colin Patterson]] later wrote similarly:

{{Quote|"We must remember the distinction between the cart--the explanation--and the horse--the data. And where models are introduced in phylogenetic reconstruction, we should prefer models dictated by features of the data to models derived from explanatory theories." &lt;ref&gt;Patterson, C. (1994). "Null or minimal models". In: ''Models In Phylogeny Reconstruction''. Scotland, R. W. , Siebert, D. J. (eds.). Systematics Association Special Volume; 173-192.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Pattern cladists, like traditional cladists, think that classifications should be isomorphic to cladograms, recognizing groups based on nested patterns of [[synapomorphy|synapomorphies]], but they argue that the discovery of characters is not dependent on apriori considerations about common ancestry:

{{Quote|"[T]o state a cladogram is a synapomorphy scheme invites the rejoinder that a cladogram must, therefore be a phyletic concept. Not so, for by ‘synapomorphy’ we mean ‘defining character’ of an inclusive taxon." &lt;ref&gt;Nelson, G. J., Platnick, N. I. (1981). ''Systematics and biogeography: cladistics and vicariance'' (Vol. 214). New York: Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Nelson &amp; Platnick (1981) also noted that: "''all'' of Hennig’s groups correspond by definition to patterns of synapomorphy. Indeed, Hennig’s trees are frequently called synapomorphy schemes. The concept of ‘patterns within patterns’ seems, therefore, an empirical generalization.” Pattern cladists hence regard synapomorphies to be patterns free of processes.

==Criticism==
A frequent (but false) accusation against pattern cladistics is that its proponents claim that systematics should be "theory free."  At some point in the 1960s and '70s [[Phenetics|pheneticists]] may have believed that, but pattern cladists are not pheneticists.  Obviously, rejecting a priori evolutionary process theories is not the same thing as categorically rejecting "theory" in toto.  Furthermore, pattern cladists do not reject post hoc evolutionary explanations for cladograms, they simply think that the evidence is independent of the explanation &lt;ref&gt;Brady, R. H. (1985). "On the independence of systematics". ''Cladistics''. 1: 113-126.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Nevertheless, some philosophers with a background conciliatory towards [[evolutionary taxonomy]] continue to offer criticisms in this vein:
{{Quote|"Pattern cladistics has remained on the fringe because of, first, its implausible assumption that there can be pure observation untainted by theory; and second, its rejection of the evolution assumption. Few systematists now think that a classification not based on evolutionary branching and history has any real signification or justification. The developing consensus is that Darwin was right – a natural classification must be genealogical."&lt;ref&gt;Ruse, M. (2008). ''The Oxford Handbook of Philosophy of Biology''. Oxford University Press. 171-172.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Of course, the distinction between the phenomenon and its explanation was clear to Darwin:  "the grand fact in natural history of the subordination of group under group, which from its familiarity, does not always sufficiently strike us, is in my judgment fully explained." &lt;ref&gt;Darwin, C. 1859. On the Origin of Species. John Murray, London, p. 413.&lt;/ref&gt;

"On the independence of systematics". ''Cladistics''. 1: 113-126.&lt;/ref&gt; introduced the terms ''explanandum'' for empirical patterns (the phenomenon to be explained) and ''explanans'' for process theory (the explanation), writing: "by making our explanation into the definition of the condition [data] to be explained, we express not scientific hypothesis but belief".  In the above quote, Darwin's "fact" is the ''explanandum''; his theory of descent with modification is the ''explanans''.

In this view, whatever the characters imply as the preferred hypothesis of relationships becomes, de facto, "genealogical" when we explain it as a result of evolution. &lt;ref&gt;Brower, A. V. Z. 2002. Cladistics, phylogeny, evidence and explanation - a reply to Lee. Zool. Scripta 31:221-223.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creationist distortion==

As noted, transformed cladistics does not deny [[common ancestry]], rather it argues a logical precedence: theories regarding processes should only be formulated after patterns are discovered.  Creationists have distorted this to argue that there are pattern cladists who are skeptical about whether evolution occurs. 

===Colin Patterson===

In November, 1981, [[Colin Patterson (biologist)|Patterson]] delivered a seminar to the Systematics Discussion Group in the American Museum of Natural History&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, C. 2002. Systematics and creationism. The Linnean 18:13-37.
&lt;/ref&gt;. In the talk, Patterson asked provocatively: "Can you tell me anything about evolution, any one thing that is true?", and remarked:

{{Quote|"As I understand it, cladistics is theoretically neutral so far as evolution is concerned. It has nothing to say about evolution. You don’t need to know about evolution, or believe in it, to do cladistic analysis. All that cladistics demands is that groups have characters."}}

A [[creationist]] in the audience taped segments of Patterson's talk to imply he was "agnostic" on the subject of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncse.com/rncse/20/3/evolution Colin Patterson: Evolution, Reports of the National Center for Science Education]&lt;/ref&gt; To his dismay, Patterson soon found his name quoted in creationist publications:

{{Quote|"I was too naive and foolish to guess what might happen: the talk was taped by a creationist who passed the tape to Luther Sunderland [...] Since, in my view, the tape was obtained unethically, I asked Sunderland to stop circulating the transcipt, but of course to no effect.  There is not much point in my going through the article point by point. I was putting a case for discussion, as I thought off the record, and was speaking only about systematics, a specialized field. I do not support the creationist movement in any way, and in particular I am opposed to their efforts to modify school curricula. In short the article does not fairly represent my views.  But even if it did, so what?  The issue should be resolved by rational discussion, and not by quoting 'authorities,' which seems to be the creationists' principal mode of argument."  (Letter from Colin Patterson to Steven W. Binkley, June 17, 1982)}}

{{Quote|"Unfortunately, and unknown to me, there was a creationist in my audience with a hidden tape recorder. A transcript of my talk was produced and circulated among creationists, and the talk has since been widely, and often inaccurately, quoted in creationist literature." (Patterson, 1994)}}  (Note that a transcript of Patterson's talk has been published in the Linnean 18(2),and may be [https://www.linnean.org/our-publications/the-linnean/the-linnean-back-issues-2001-2010 downloaded] from the Linnean Society).

{{Quote|text="Because creationists lack scientific research to support such theories as a young earth ... a world-wide flood ... or separate ancestry for humans and apes, their common tactic is to attack evolution by hunting out debate or dissent among evolutionary biologists. ... I learned that one should think carefully about candour in argument (in publications, lectures, or correspondence) in case one was furnishing creationist campaigners with ammunition in the form of 'quotable quotes', often taken out of context."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bartelt |first=Karen |date=May–June 2000 |title=Review: Evolution |url=http://ncse.com/rncse/20/3/evolution |journal=Reports of the National Center for Science Education |type=Book review |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=38–39 |issn=2158-818X |accessdate=2015-05-21}} Bartelt quoting from Patterson, ''Evolution'' (1999), p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9777">The '''two-state vector formalism''' ('''TSVF''') is a description of [[quantum mechanics]] in terms of a [[causality|causal]] relation in which the present is caused by quantum states of the past and of the future taken in combination.

==Theory==
The two-state vector formalism is one example of a time-symmetric interpretation of quantum mechanics (see [[Minority interpretations of quantum mechanics]]). Time-symmetric interpretations of quantum mechanics were first suggested by [[Walter Schottky]] in 1921,&lt;ref name="Schottky1921"&gt;{{cite journal

 | doi = 10.1007/bf01494985
 | pmid = 
| bibcode = 1921NW......9..492S
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and later by several other scientists. The two-state vector formalism was first developed by [[Satosi Watanabe]]&lt;ref name="Watanabe1955"&gt;{{cite journal

 | title = Symmetry of physical laws. Part III. Prediction and retrodiction

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1955, who named it the Double Inferential state-Vector Formalism (DIVF). Watanabe proposed that information given by forwards evolving [[quantum state]]s is not complete; rather, both forwards and backwards evolving quantum states are required to describe a quantum state: a first state vector that evolves from the initial conditions towards the future, and a second state vector that evolves backwards in time from future boundary conditions. Past and future measurements, taken together, provide complete information about a quantum system. Watanabe's work was later rediscovered by [[Yakir Aharonov]], [[Peter Bergmann]] and [[Joel Lebowitz]] in 1964, who later renamed it the Two-State Vector Formalism (TSVF).&lt;ref&gt;Yakir Aharonov, Lev Vaidman: ''Protective measurements of two-state vectors'', in: Robert Sonné Cohen, Michael Horne, John J. Stachel (eds.): ''Potentiality, Entanglement and Passion-At-A-Distance'', Quantum Mechanical Studies for A. M. Shimony, Volume Two, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0792344537}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;1–8, [https://books.google.com/books?id=DsNoIcQemTsC&amp;pg=PA2 p. 2]&lt;/ref&gt; Conventional [[prediction]], as well as [[retrodiction]], can be obtained formally by separating out the initial conditions (or, conversely, the final conditions) by performing sequences of coherence-destroying operations, thereby cancelling out the influence of the two state vectors.&lt;ref&gt;Yakir Aharonov, Peter G. Bergmann, Joel L. Lebowitz: ''Time symmetry in the quantum process of measurement'', Physical Review B., vol.&amp;nbsp;134, no.&amp;nbsp;6, pp.&amp;nbsp;1410–1416, 1964&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''two-state vector'' is represented by:
{{Equation box 1
|indent =:
|equation = &lt;math&gt;\langle\Phi| \ \ \ |\Psi\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding
|border
|border colour = #50C878
|background colour = #ECFCF4}}
where the state &lt;math&gt;\langle\Phi|&lt;/math&gt; evolves backwards from the future and the state &lt;math&gt;|\Psi\rangle&lt;/math&gt; evolves forwards from the past.

In the example of the [[double-slit experiment]], the first state vector evolves from the electron leaving its source, the second state vector evolves backwards from the final location of the electron on the detection screen, and the combination of forwards and backwards evolving state vectors determines what occurs when the electron passes the slits.

The two-state vector formalism provides a time-symmetric description of quantum mechanics, and is constructed such as to be [[time-reversal invariance|time-reversal invariant]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Dickson: ''Non-relativistic quantum mechanics'', [[Jeremy Butterfield]], [[John Earman]] (eds.): ''Philosophy of Physics'', Handbook of the Philosophy of Science, North-Holland, Elsevier, pp.&amp;nbsp;275–416, [https://books.google.com/books?id=2oSn5I70WW0C&amp;pg=PA327 Footnote on p. 327]&lt;/ref&gt; It can be employed in particular for analyzing pre- and post-selected quantum systems. Building on the notion of two-state, Reznik and Aharonov constructed a time-symmetric formulation of quantum mechanics that encompasses probabilistic observables as well as nonprobabilistic weak observables.&lt;ref&gt;B. Reznik, and Y. Aharonov: ''Time-symmetric formulation of quantum mechanics'', Phys. Rev. A, vol.&amp;nbsp;52, no.&amp;nbsp;4, pp.&amp;nbsp;2538–2550, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to other work==

In view of the TSVF approach, and in order to allow information to be obtained about quantum systems that are both pre- and post-selected, Yakir Aharonov, [[David Albert]] and [[Lev Vaidman]] developed the theory of [[weak value]]s.

In TSVF, causality is time-symmetric; that is, the usual chain of causality is not simply reversed. Rather, TSVF combines causality both from the past (forward causation) and the future (backwards causation, or [[retrocausality]]).

Similarly as the [[de Broglie–Bohm theory]], TSVF yields the same predictions as standard quantum mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;Yakir Aharonov, Lev Vaidmann: ''About position measurements which do not show the Bohmian particle position'', in: [[James T. Cushing]], Arthur Fine, Sheldon Goldstein (eds.): ''Bohmian mechanics and quantum theory: an appraisal'', Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1996, pp.&amp;nbsp;141–154,  [https://books.google.com/books?id=EFrDTg3ztfEC&amp;pg=PA141 p. 141], [https://books.google.com/books?id=EFrDTg3ztfEC&amp;pg=PA147 147]&lt;/ref&gt; Lev Vaidman emphasizes that TSVF fits very well with [[Hugh Everett]]'s [[many-worlds interpretation]].&lt;ref&gt;Yakir Aharonov, Lev Vaidman: ''The Two-State Vector Formalism of Quantum Mechanics: an Updated Review''. In: Juan Gonzalo Muga, Rafael Sala Mayato, Íñigo Egusquiza (eds.): ''Time in Quantum Mechanics'', Volume 1, Lecture Notes in Physics 734, pp.&amp;nbsp;399–447, 2nd ed., Springer, 2008, {{ISBN|978-3540734727}}, DOI 10.1007/978-3-540-73473-4_13, [https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0105101v2 arXiv:quant-ph/0105101v2] (submitted 21 May 2001, version of 10 June 2007) [https://books.google.com/books?id=InKru6zHQWgC&amp;pg=PA443 p. 443]&lt;/ref&gt;

The two-state vector formalism has similarities with the [[transactional interpretation]] of quantum mechanics proposed by [[John G. Cramer]] in 1986, although Ruth Kastner has argued that the two interpretations (Transactional and Two-State Vector) have important differences as well.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth E. Kastner, talk presented at Cambridge 2014 Conference, ''Free Will and Retrocausality in the Quantum World,'' [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMZuBbW6Rcg]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Avshalom Elitzur|Avshalom C. Elitzur]], Eliahu Cohen: ''The Retrocausal Nature of Quantum Measurement Revealed by Partial and Weak Measurements'', AIP Conf. Proc. 1408: ''Quantum Retrocausation: Theory and Experiment (13–14 June 2011, San Diego, California)'', pp.&amp;nbsp;120-131, {{DOI|10.1063/1.3663720}} ([https://archive.is/20120713100902/http://proceedings.aip.org/resource/2/apcpcs/1408/1/120_1 abstract])&lt;/ref&gt; It shares the property of [[Time reversal symmetry|time symmetry]] with the [[Wheeler–Feynman absorber theory]] by [[Richard Feynman]] and [[John Archibald Wheeler]] and with the ''time–symmetric quantum mechanics'' of K. B. Wharton.

The '''unicolor cribo''' (''Drymarchon melanurus unicolor'') is a Central American subspecies of the [[Cribo|cribo snakes]]. The eastern [[indigo snake]], ''Drymarchon corais couperi'' is another species of this genus. Until recently the unicolor cribo was considered a subspecies of the same species as the indigo snake ''Drymarchon corais unicolor''.

Unlike the [[indigo snake]], which is dark blue to almost black, the unicolor cribo has a yellow or golden color with black facial and neck bar-like markings. 

This snake reaches a length of over nine feet. It is terrestrial and [[diurnality|diurnal]]. It can be found in marshes, swamps, and riverbeds. The unicolor cribo is non-venomous. It bites its prey without coiling around it. It pins its prey, crushing it, and then swallows it whole. Its prey consists of other snakes, including [[venomous snake]]s, small mammals, small birds, [[lizard]]s, [[frog]]s, [[fish]], and other small [[vertebrate]] animals.

The '''Zanzibar servaline genet''' (''Genetta servalina archeri'') is a recently discovered [[subspecies]] of [[servaline genet]] endemic to [[Unguja|Unguja Island]] in the [[Tanzania]]n archipelago of [[Zanzibar]]. Its conservation status is uncertain.&lt;ref name=Rompaey&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Van Rompaey, H.  |author2=Colyn, M.  |lastauthoramp=yes | year = 1998 | title = A New Servaline Genet (Carnivora, Viverridae) from Zanzibar Island | journal = South African Journal of Zoology | volume = 33 | pages = 42–46|url=http://content.ajarchive.org/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/00445096&amp;CISOPTR=968&amp;REC=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evolutionary history ==
The closest known relative of the Zanzibar servaline genet is [[Lowe's servaline genet]], ''G. s. lowei'', a subspecies which is found in the [[Eastern Arc Mountains]] of mainland Tanzania. These two animals have presumably been evolving independently since at least the end of the last [[ice age]], when Unguja was separated from continental [[Africa]] by rising sea levels. The survival of the servaline genet on the island parallels that of the endemic [[Zanzibar leopard]], and the [[Zanzibar red colobus]].

== Discovery and description ==

Although the servaline was known to rural Zanzibaris,&lt;ref name=Goldman2004&gt;{{cite journal | author = Goldman, H.V., Winther-Hansen, J. &amp; Walsh, M.T. | year = 2004|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/13994952/Zanzibars-Recently-Discovered-Servaline-Genet | title = Zanzibar's Recently Discovered Servaline Genet | journal = Nature East Africa | volume = 34 | issue = 2 | pages = 5–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; zoologists remained unaware of its existence until the last decade of the 20th century. In 1995 Tony Archer, a wildlife consultant working in Zanzibar, acquired a dried skin and skull in the village of Kitogani, in south-central Unguja. This specimen was subsequently described as a new subspecies of servaline genet (''G. s. archeri''), named in honour of Archer.&lt;ref name=Rompaey/&gt;

In January 2003 live Zanzibar servaline genets were photographed for the first time in nearby [[Jozani-Chwaka Bay National Park]]. Camera traps yielded pictures of servalines at four locations, two in groundwater forest in the heart of the park and two in dry scrub to the north-east. These photographs provided new information about the distribution of the genet and its physical characteristics.&lt;ref name=Goldman2003a&gt;{{cite web |author1=Goldman, H.V.  |author2=Winther-Hansen, J.  |lastauthoramp=yes | year = 2003 | url = http://www.trailmaster.com/reference/ZbarCamTrap2003.pdf | title = The Small Carnivores of Unguja: Results of a Photo-trapping Survey in Jozani Forest Reserve, Zanzibar, Tanzania | accessdate = 2007-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Goldman2003b&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Goldman, H.V.  |author2=Winther-Hansen, J.  |lastauthoramp=yes | year = 2003 | title = First Photographs of the Zanzibar Servaline Genet, ''Genetta servaline archeri'', and Other Endemic Subspecies on the Island of Unguja, Tanzania | journal = Small Carnivore Conservation | volume = 29 | pages = 1–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
