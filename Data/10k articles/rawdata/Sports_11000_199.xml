The format consisted of 12 games, with each team facing the other competitors three times. Because the series was so small, each team had to face each other in one night. 
 
==Summary==
For the first time, Venezuela captured the competition with a record of 7-1 behind strong [[pitcher|pitching]] performances by [[Orlando Peña]] (2-0, 2.00 [[earned run average|ERA]] in 18.0 [[innings pitched]]), [[Aurelio Monteagudo]] (2-0, one shutout, 16 SO, 0.00 in 12 2⁄3 IP), [[Jay Ritchie]] (one-hit, nine-[[strikeout|SO]] [[shutout]]), and [[Larry Jaster]] (1-0, 3.30 ERA in 16 1⁄3 IP). With [[Carlos Pascual]] as [[Manager (baseball)|manager]], [[first baseman|1B]] [[Gonzalo Márquez]] was voted [[Most Valuable Player]] after leading Series hitters with a .478 [[batting average]] (11-for-25). Other contributions came from  [[second baseman|2B]] [[Gus Gil|Gustavo Gil]] (.387, four [[run (baseball)|runs]], seven [[run batted in|RBI]]),  [[center fielder|CF]] [[César Tovar]] (.349, five runs, three [[stolen base]]s), [[catcher|C]] [[Ray Fosse]] (.391, four runs), and [[third baseman|3B]] [[Dámaso Blanco]] (five runs, five RBI). Also in the roster were infielder [[Chico Ruiz]], outfielder [[Jim Holt (baseball)|Jim Holt]], and pitchers [[Don Eddy (baseball)|Don Eddy]], [[Mike Hedlund]] and [[Luis Peñalver]].

The team of Puerto Rico, with [[Jim Fregosi]] at the helm, finished second with a 4-4 mark. The pitching staff was led by [[Wayne Simpson]], who went 2-0 with a 1.12 ERA and two [[complete game]]s, including a four-hit [[shutout]]. Also in the roster were pitchers [[Mike Cuellar]], [[Paul Doyle (baseball)|Paul Doyle]] and [[Clyde Wright]]; [[catcher]] [[Pat Corrales]]; [[infielder]]s [[José Cruz]] (1B), [[Sandy Alomar, Sr.|Sandy Alomar Sr.]] (2B), [[Tony Pérez]] ([[third baseman|3B]]) and [[Jackie Hernández]] (SS), and [[outfielder]]s [[Julio Roque]] ([[left fielder|LF]]), [[Luis Meléndez (baseball)|Luis Meléndez]] (CF) and [[Bernie Carbo]] ([[right fielder|RF]]). Meléndez led the Puerto Rican offensive with one home run, six runs and six RBI.

Dominican Republic, led by outfielder/manager [[Manny Mota]], ended in last place with a 1-7 record. The team's only victory came behind a strong pitching effort from [[Reggie Cleveland]], who threw nine innings of one-hit, one run ball against Puerto Rico. The team featured players as [[Matty Alou]], [[Rico Carty]], [[César Cedeño]], [[Elvio Jiménez]] and [[Freddie Velázquez]].

==News==
[[File:Asashoryu 2004.jpg|thumb|right|Asashoryu performs the [[dohyo-iri]] during a regional tour in 2004.]]

===January===
*The number of spots in the top division increases for the first time since January 1991, from 40 to 42. The second highest juryo division increases from 26 to 28.
*At the Hatsu basho in Tokyo, achieving his first ever undefeated [[yusho]], [[Yokozuna (sumo)|Yokozuna]] [[Asashoryu]] wins his 5th championship. Runner-up is former [[sekiwake]] [[Kotomitsuki]], who has fallen temporarily to a [[maegashira]] rank but produces a fine 13–2 score and wins the Fighting Spirit [[sansho (sumo)|Prize]]. [[Kakizoe Toru|Kakizoe]] wins 11 and is rewarded with the Technique Prize and promotion to the [[sanyaku]] ranks for the first time. [[Ōzeki|Ozeki]] [[Tochiazuma Daisuke|Tochiazuma]], who was hoping for yokozuna promotion after winning the previous tournament, can only produce a disappointing 9–6 score. Former [[komusubi]] [[Wakanoyama]] wins the juryo division championship. The [[makushita]] championship is won by the 17-year-old Hagiwara (now [[Kisenosato]]) with a perfect 7–0 record. Announcing their retirements are former komusubi [[Oginishiki]] and two former juryo veterans; the 38-year-old [[Argentine]] [[Hoshitango]] and the 39-year-old [[Mutsuhokkai]], whose career spanned 23 years.
*The [[danpatsu-shiki|retirement ceremonies]] of former sekiwake [[Akinoshima]] and former komusubi [[Daizen Takahiro|Daizen]] take place at the Kokougikan.

===February===
*Former ozeki [[Takanohana Kenshi]], head of the Futagoyama stable, previously known as Fujishima stable, steps down due to ill health and passes control over to his son [[Takanohana Koji]], who renames the stable [[Takanohana stable]].
*Former sekiwake [[Terao]] branches out from [[Izutsu stable]] and opens his own [[Shikoroyama stable]].
* The Sumo Association hold exhibition tournaments in [[South Korea]], visiting [[Seoul]] on the 14th and 15th, and [[Pusan]] on the 18th. Former top division wrestler [[Kasugao]] is from South Korea and is enthusiastically cheered on by the crowds. Asashoryu wins the exhibitions.

===March===
*At the Haru basho in Osaka, Asashoryu chalks up a second 15–0 championship in a row to take his 6th overall. His winning streak now stands at 30 matches. The ozeki [[Kaio Hiroyuki|Kaio]] and [[Chiyotaikai Ryuji|Chiyotaikai]] both have excellent tournaments and finish runners-up on 13–2. Tochiazuma, by contrast, drops out after only two days. The fourth ozeki [[Musoyama]], who was in danger of demotion, retains his rank with a 9–6 score. Maegashira 12 [[Asasekiryu]] is the third runner-up on 13–2 and wins two special prizes for Outstanding Performance and Technique. Former sekiwake [[Kotonowaka]], at the age of nearly 36, wins 11 matches and his fourth Fighting Spirit Prize. [[Mongolia]]n [[Hakuho]] wins the juryo championship after a playoff with [[Hayateumi]] and earns promotion to the top [[makuuchi]] division. [[Bulgaria]]n [[Kotoōshū]] wins the makushita championship with a 7–0 score and is promoted to juryo along with Hagiwara and [[Toyonoshima]].
*The [[Takekuma stable]], run by the former sekiwake [[Kurohimeyama]], shuts down. This is because his only wrestler (his son Hagurokuni) is retiring. Takekuma is moving to [[Tomozuna stable]] and says he may re-open his stable at some point in the future.

===May===
[[File:Tochiazuma Daisuke.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tochiazuma Daisuke|Tochiazuma]] in 2004, a year in which was twice demoted from the ozeki rank after injury problems.]]
*At the Natsu basho in Tokyo, Asashoryu's winning streak is sensationally halted at 35 by maegashira [[Hokutoriki]], who has never defeated a yokozuna before. Hokutoriki remains in contention for the title right up until the end of the tournament. Coming into Day 15 on 13–1, one win ahead of Asashoryu, he is defeated by Hakuho (who scores 12–3 and wins the Fighting Spirit Prize in his debut top division tournament) and subsequently loses a playoff to Asashoryu, who wins his 3rd championship in a row, and his 7th overall. Hokutoriki is rewarded with the Outstanding Performance and Technique Prizes. Tochiazuma is still unable to compete and loses his ozeki status. Veteran former ozeki [[Takanonami]], who has been fighting in the maegashira ranks for most of the last four years, announces his retirement, leaving the newly renamed Takanohana stable without any [[sekitori]] ranked wrestlers. Former komusubi [[Hamanoshima]], in the makushita division for the last two years, and former maegashira [[Wakanojo]], who has fallen all the way to the [[jonidan]] division, also retire. Mongolian [[Tokitenku]] wins the juryo division championship. Two [[Estonia]]n wrestlers, [[Baruto]] and Kitaoji, make their professional debuts. (Kitaoji quits after only three tournaments.)

===July===
*At the Nagoya basho, Asashoryu takes his 4th [[yusho]] in a row with a 13–2 record. His wins include an extraordinary victory over Kotonowaka on Day 8, in a rematch after he was on the brink of defeat in the first bout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pair remain tied for lead at Nagoya basho|publisher=[[Japan Times]]|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/ss20040712a1.html|date=12 July 2004|accessdate=5 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Runners-up are maegashira [[Miyabiyama]] and [[Toyozakura]], who each score 12–3. Toyozakura wins the Fighting Spirit Award (no other prizes are given out this time). Kaio scores 11–4. Tochiazuma regains his ozeki rank by winning ten bouts, the fourth man to achieve this after [[Mienoumi]], Takanonami and Musoyama. Hokutoriki, who was promoted to sekiwake after his fine performance in May, manages to win only three matches. Kotooshu wins the juryo championship with a 13–2 score and earns promotion to the top division.

===August===
*Former juryo wrestler [[Kanechika]] takes over the [[Miyagino stable]], replacing the former maegashira [[Chikubayama]], mentor of Hakuho, who stays on as an assistant coach. The new Miyagino Oyakata has no connection to the stable, having wrestled for [[Kitanoumi stable]], but he has been adopted by the widow of a previous head of the stable.

===September===
[[File:Dohyo-iri ceremony.jpg|thumb|right|Asashoryu accompanied by [[Asasekiryu]] and [[Kaiho]] during the September 2004 tournament.]]
*At the Aki basho in Tokyo, Asashoryu's chance for a clean sweep of the 2004 tournaments is dashed when he pulls off a poor 9–6 record and [[Kaio Hiroyuki|Kaio]] gets his 5th championship with a 13–2 record. Asashoryu's mediocre performance is attributed to a lack of training due to his wedding reception on 31 August. [[Tochinonada]] and [[Kyokushuzan]] finish runners-up on 11–4, with Tochinonada receiving the Outstanding Performance Prize, while [[Roho Yukio|Roho]] and Kotonowaka each score ten and share the Fighting Spirit award. Musoyama and Tochiazuma both drop out through injury and will be [[Makuuchi#Relegation from ōzeki|kadoban]] in November. [[Ama Kohei|Ama]] wins the juryo championship with an 11–4 score. [[Tamaasuka]] wins the makushita title with a perfect 7–0 record and reaches the sekitori ranks for the first time. Hagiwara is promoted to the top division alongside Ama, changing his name to Kisenosato. At 18 years and 3 months he is the second youngest after Takanohana II to achieve this.
*Former sekiwake [[Masudayama]] of the [[Kasugano stable]] leaves to open his own [[Chiganoura stable]].

===October===
*2: The retirement ceremony or [[danpatsu-shiki]] of the 67th yokozuna [[Musashimaru Kōyō|Musashimaru]] takes place at the Kokugikan.

===November===
*At the Kyushu basho, Asashoryu comes back with a 13–2 championship, his 9th overall.

The '''Brick Breeden Fieldhouse''' is a multi-purpose indoor [[arena]] located on the campus of [[Montana State University]] in [[Bozeman, Montana]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://msubobcats.com/news/2017/2/26/mens-basketball-in-front-of-a-sellout-crowd-bobcats-topple-griz-in-fieldhouse.aspx Men's basketball article]&lt;/ref&gt; It is the home of the [[Montana State Bobcats]] of the [[Big Sky Conference]]; the primary venue for [[Montana State Bobcats men's basketball|men's]] and [[Montana State Bobcats women's basketball|women's basketball]] and indoor [[track and field]].

The arena regularly has numerous tournaments, concerts, plays, speaking engagements, and trade shows throughout the year; it annually hosts the [[Montana High School Association|high school]] all-class state [[volleyball]] tournament and the MSU Spring [[Rodeo]]. The Big Sky [[Big Sky Conference Men's Basketball Tournament|men's basketball tournament]] finals were played here in 1988,&lt;ref name=bsbibs&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=VqgpAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=jO8DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2646%2C7595786 |work=Spokesman-Review |location= (Spokane, Washington) |last=Boling |first=Dave |title=Boise St. best in Big Sky |date=March 13, 1988 |page=B1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1996,&lt;ref name=resid&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=p2JWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=wvEDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1678%2C4491498 |work=Spokesman-Review |location=(Spokane, Washington) |last=Lee |first=Greg |title=Resilient Idaho does job on Montana |date=March 8, 1996 |page=C1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2002,&lt;ref name=epfspodc&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=7phXAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=j_IDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6444%2C6933181 |work=Spokesman-Review |location=(Spokane, Washington) |last=Meehan |first=Jim |title=Eagles playing for spot on dance card |date=March 9, 2002 |page=C1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Big Sky Conference Women's Basketball Tournament|women's]] in 1993.

On the south side of campus, its [[elevation]] at street level is {{convert|4,920|ft}} above [[sea level]].

==History==
The building was the inspiration of architect Oswald "Ozzie" Berg Jr. and Montana State College (MSC) president [[Roland Renne]], who dreamed of an indoor facility large enough for [[college football]] games.  Though there was not enough funding to build it big enough to house a full-sized football field, the fieldhouse was the largest clear-span wooden structure in the world,&lt;ref&gt;[http://bozemandailychronicle.com/fieldhouse/21.pdf Rollie's Folly]&lt;/ref&gt; since surpassed by other buildings such as the [[Walkup Skydome]] in [[Flagstaff, Arizona]], and the [[Tacoma Dome]] in [[Tacoma, Washington]].

Opened {{Time ago|1957}} in 1957 as the MSC Fieldhouse,&lt;ref&gt;[http://bozemandailychronicle.com/fieldhouse/04.pdf 50th anniversary section] of the ''Bozeman Daily Chronicle''&lt;/ref&gt; it was named for longtime basketball coach [[Brick Breeden|John "Brick" Breeden]] in 1981.&lt;ref name=bblll11&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bozemandailychronicle.com/100/brick-breeden-left-long-legacy-at-msu/article_01c5d988-cbba-11e0-b28d-001cc4c03286.html |work=Bozeman Daily Chronicle |location=(Montana) |last=Kaiser |first=Gidal |title=Brick Breeden left long legacy at MSU |date=August 21, 2011 |accessdate=March 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main arena was named Worthington Arena in 1985 in honor of Max Worthington, a starting guard on Montana State's [[1928–29 Montana State Bobcats men's basketball team|1928-29 national championship team]].&lt;ref name=nmfh&gt;[http://bozemandailychronicle.com/fieldhouse/06.pdf Naming the fieldhouse]&lt;/ref&gt; Both were members of the 1929 "Golden Bobcats" basketball team,&lt;ref name=bblll11/&gt; named national champions by the [[Helms Foundation]]. Breeden later coached the Bobcats basketball team and served as athletic director, and Worthington, also a former coach, served as a school administrator and longtime booster.&lt;ref name=bblll11/&gt;&lt;ref name=nmfh/&gt;

From 1959-1960, the fieldhouse hosted indoor [[Little League]] games.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bozemandailychronicle.com/sports/who-s-on-first-bozeman-little-league-hosted-first-ever/article_113385ef-07ed-5fc4-ad1a-cd0095e81188.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960, the arena drew national attention as it hosted a [[National Boxing Association]] [[middleweight]] title bout between [[Gene Fullmer]] and [[Joey Giardello]] on April 20.&lt;ref name=grsftt&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=4ChYAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=IfcDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2229%2C5138810 |work=Spokane Daily Chronicle |location=(Washington) |agency=Associated Press |title=Giardello shoots for title tonight |date=April 20, 1960 |page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cdtbtc&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1960/04/21/page/109/article/fullmer-held-to-draw-keeps-title |work=Chicago Daily Tribune |agency=Associated Press |title=Fullmer held to draw; keeps title |date=April 21, 1960 |page=1, sec. 6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bdecdr&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=4ShYAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=IfcDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5403%2C5360908 |work=Spokane Daily Chronicle |location=(Washington) |agency=Associated Press |title=Gene Fullmer keeps crown as bout is declared draw |date=April 21, 1960 |page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first title fight held in Montana in 37 years, since the infamous [[Jack Dempsey vs. Tommy Gibbons]] heavyweight bout,&lt;ref name=gbbnbf&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1923/07/05/page/19/article/gibbons-brainy-fight-a-masterpiece-of-defense |work=Chicago Daily Tribune |title=Gibbons brainy fight a masterpiece of defense

[[File:BrickBreedenFieldhouse.jpg|thumb|200px|North end from Grant Street, 2010]]

==Rodeo==
The [[College National Finals Rodeo]] was annually held in the fieldhouse from 1970 to 1996, with the exception of 1979, when it was in [[Lake Charles, Louisiana]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnfr.com/previouschamps.php CNFR Past Champions]&lt;/ref&gt; MSU's annual Spring Rodeo takes place in the arena in April.

==Renovations==
The main floor was originally dirt, which was not uncommon for a collegiate multi-purpose field house in that era; [[Hec Edmundson Pavilion]] in [[Seattle]] long had an unfinished earthen floor. With its usage as a rodeo venue, the dirt surface in Bozeman was practical at the time.

A portable raised basketball court was assembled in the center of the space and wooden boardwalks led spectators from the entrance to the concession stand and bleachers. Basketball players were obliged to wipe their feet after emerging from the dressing rooms and before stepping up to the court.

In 1980, the entire arena floor was covered with a hard tartan ([[polyurethane]]) surface and new folding bleachers were installed on the main level.  Other than the new floor, the facility changed very little in its first forty years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bozemandailychronicle.com/fieldhouse/20.pdf Renovation]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Cat-Griz Basketball game.jpg|thumb|Montana vs. MSU basketball player introductions, 2017]]
In 1998, a $13.2 million renovation was completed that transformed the building into a modern multi-purpose arena.  A new main entrance was constructed on the south side that brings spectators into the arena at the mezzanine level.  Elevators and other features were added to make the building handicapped accessible.  Old bleacher and chairback seats were replaced.  The building's mechanical systems were upgraded, and additional fire, life-safety, and seismic features were added to bring the building up to modern codes.  The renovation also featured new administrative and coaches offices, locker room improvements, better concession stands, new reception areas, and a new Hall of Fame.  The arena can be converted quickly from athletic events to concerts, to theater performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{

'''Ewen Fields''' in [[Hyde, Greater Manchester]], [[England]], is the home ground of [[Hyde United F.C.]] and has also hosted [[Manchester City F.C. Reserves and Academy|Manchester City Reserves]], [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United F.C. Reserves]], [[Stockport County F.C.|Stockport County Reserves]] and Oldham Curzon Ladies. 

The stadium formerly used Baspograss, on which Hyde United played [[Darlington]] in the 1st Round Proper in 1994, the last non-qualifying FA Cup game on an artificial surface for twenty years, until [[Maidstone United]] played [[Stevenage]] on their artificial surface in 2014. 

It also hosted an [[American football]] team, the [[Manchester Spartans]], in the 1980s after a surge in the sport's popularity in the UK following [[Channel 4]]'s coverage of live [[National Football League|NFL]] games. A [[Rugby League]] [[Super League]] game between Oldham and Sheffield was staged at the stadium in 1997.

The stadium holds 4,250 people, with 530 seats.&lt;ref name="Hyde United FC"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hydefc.co.uk/a/stadium-33155.html | title=Stadium Guide | work=hydefc.co.uk | accessdate=24 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Today==

Ewen Fields is made up of five stands, the Main Stand, the Scrattin Shed, the Tinker's Passage End, the Leigh Street Stand and the Walker Lane End. All of the stands are covered.

The Main Stand is the only seated stand at Ewen Fields. It also houses the players' dressing rooms, board room and sponsors lounge as well as a refreshments bar and toilets.

Next to the Main Stand is the Scrattin' Shed, although it is more commonly known as the Shed End, despite not actually being at the end of the ground. This is where the most vociferous home fans usually congregate. The Social Club is behind the Shed, and traverses the boundary wall. There is a door inside the ground, and one in the car park.

The Tinker's Passage End (named after the footpath which runs behind the stand) is behind the goal nearest to the Scrattin' Shed. Unusually, the stand runs at an acute angle to the goal line. This is because the pitch prior to the Astroturf was not a perfect rectangle, and the stand, which used to be parallel to the goal line, shows the extent of this previous irregularity. Away fans are housed in the Tinker's Passage End on the rare occasions that games at Ewen Fields are segregated.

Running opposite to the Main Stand and Scrattin' Shed is the Leigh Street Stand, behind the home and away dugouts where another set of home fans stand. A second refreshments bar is also on this side.

The Walker Lane End (sometimes referred to as the Baths End due to the leisure centre behind the stand) is behind the goal at the opposite end to the Tinker's Passage End. When the Astroturf was laid, and the pitch realigned, it was also lengthened at this end. As a result, the Walker Lane Stand was built afterwards, and is parallel to the goal line.

In 2010, Hyde United changed their name to Hyde F.C. and had a kit change to black and white. Ewen Fields had a make over in summer 2010, funded by [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] as part of the clubs' partnership. In 2015, the club reverted to being called Hyde United.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hydefc.co.uk/news/hyde-fc-to-return-to-hyde-united-1432047.html Hyde FC to return to Hyde United]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Exer-Station''' is an isometric [[Exergaming|exertainment]] device that controls video games on several platforms. This includes the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], [[GameCube]], [[PlayStation]], [[PlayStation 2]] and the [[Personal computer|PC]].

==Description==
The platform consists of a backrest and a single isometric pole/tube with a [[PlayStation]] style controller on top. The user stands on the platform while pushing, pulling or twisting the pole and pressing buttons on the controller. The exercise is considered isometric since the pole does not move.

It was formerly known as Kilowatt.&lt;ref name="Nagle2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeanne Nagle|title=Frequently Asked Questions about Wii and Video Game Injuries and Fitness|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jYkuaDmKzxkC&amp;pg=PA14|year=2010|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-4358-5329-4|pages=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fiserv Forum''' ({{IPAc-en|f|aɪ|'|s|ə|r|v|_|f|ɒ|r|'|ə|m}}) is a multi-purpose arena located in downtown [[Milwaukee|Milwaukee, Wisconsin]].

==History==
Despite being one of the premier NBA facilities when completed in 1988, the [[Bradley Center|BMO Harris Bradley Center]] was one of the oldest active NBA arenas by the end of the Bucks' tenancy in 2018. Only  [[Madison Square Garden]] in [[New York City]] and [[Oracle Arena]] in [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] were older than the Bradley Center; however, both Madison Square Garden and Oracle Arena were substantially renovated during their lifetimes, although Oracle Arena is scheduled to be replaced by the new [[Chase Center (San Francisco)|Chase Center]] in [[San Francisco]] in 2019. The funds for the building of the BMO Harris Bradley Center were donated by [[Jane Bradley Pettit]] and husband [[Lloyd Pettit]] without any provision for the building's long-term capital needs or annual operating expenses. Although the facility was self-sufficient, the BMO Harris Bradley Center tenants, such as the Bucks, were at a disadvantage compared with other NBA teams because of the arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bradley Center a Home-Court Disadvantage|first=Don|last=Walker|url=http://www.jsonline.com/business/36087854.html|newspaper=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]|date=December 13, 2008|accessdate=April 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Building a new downtown arena was proposed by former Bucks owner and former U.S. Senator [[Herb Kohl]]. There was considerable discussion in the region about the idea of a publicly funded arena and ultimately no resolution was reached. In 2009, Wisconsin Governor [[Jim Doyle]] included a provision in the state's capital budget seeking $5 million in state bonding support to renovate the Bradley Center. The Bradley Center's board of directors told state officials that the building needed $23 million in renovations, so they reportedly agreed to raise the remaining $18 million on their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Doyle Budget Includes Help for Bradley Center|first=Don|last=Walker|url=http://www.jsonline.com/business/41916182.html |newspaper=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]|date=March 26, 2009|accessdate=April 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 18, 2013, then-deputy NBA commissioner [[Adam Silver]] toured the arena and said it was a few thousand square feet short of NBA standards, and also lacked numerous amenities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Incoming NBA Commissioner Silver Says Bradley Center Unfit for League|first=Rich|last=Kirchen|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/milwaukee/blog/2013/09/milwaukee-needs-a-new-arena-nbas.html?page=all|newspaper=[[American City Business Journals|Milwaukee Business Journal]]|date=September 18, 2013|accessdate=June 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 16, 2014, Kohl announced an agreement to sell the franchise to New York City hedge-fund investors Marc Lasry and Wesley Edens. The deal included provisions for $100 million each from Kohl and the new ownership group, for a total of $200 million, toward the construction of a new downtown arena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kohl Sells Bucks for $550 Million; $200 Million Pledged for New Arena|first=Don|last=Walker|url=http://www.jsonline.com/sports/bucks/milwaukee-bucks-sold-by-herb-kohl-for-550-million-to-billionaire-investors-b99249475z1-255535471.html|newspaper=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]|date=April 17, 2014|accessdate=June 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon afterward, the NBA gave the Bucks an ultimatum—get a new arena, or be close to completing a new arena, by the start of the 2017–18 season. If not, the league would buy the franchise from Lasry and Edens and sell the Bucks to one of two prospecting ownership groups; one in Las Vegas and the other in Seattle, which would have meant the certain departure of the Bucks from Milwaukee. On July 15, 2015, the [[Wisconsin Senate]] approved funding for the new arena by a 21–10 margin, and on July 28, 2015, the [[Wisconsin State Assembly]] approved funding by a 52-34 margin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fox6now.com/2015/07/28/wisconsin-assembly-approves-milwaukee-bucks-arena-deal/ |title=Wisconsin Assembly approves Milwaukee Bucks arena funding deal; Gov. Walker says he’ll sign it |publisher=FOX6Now.com |date=July 28, 2015 |accessdate=July 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 12, 2015, Governor [[Scott Walker (politician)|Scott Walker]] signed the arena spending plan at [[Wisconsin State Fair Park]] in [[West Allis]], [[Wisconsin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=By Brendan O&amp;#x27;Brien |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/wisconsins-walker-signs-nba-arena-spending-plan-milwaukee-163923927--nba.html |title=Wisconsin's Walker signs NBA arena spending plan for Milwaukee |publisher=Sports.yahoo.com |date=August 12, 2015 |accessdate=July 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Milwaukee]] city council voted 12-3 on September 22, 2015, to approve the plan. The city's Plan Commission gave unanimous conditional approval to the Bucks' general development plans for land in the [[Park Freeway|Park East Corridor]] on November 23, while acknowledging possible parking problems in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Posted 5:13 pm, November 23, 2015, by Theo Keith |url=http://fox6now.com/2015/11/23/plan-commission-approves-general-bucks-arena-development-plans-but-theres-new-problems-regarding-parking/ |title=Plan Commission approves general Bucks arena development plans; but new parking problems arise |publisher=Fox6now.com |date=November 23, 2015 |accessdate=July 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 13, 2016, the Bucks signed a 30-year lease to play in the new arena. In addition Marquette University has agreed to lease the arena for its home games, beginning in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Terry Sater |url=http://www.wisn.com/news/done-deal-milwaukee-bucks-sign-30year-lease/39005940 |title=Done deal: Milwaukee Bucks sign 30-year lease for arena |publisher=Wisn.com |date=April 13, 2016 |accessdate=July 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The official groundbreaking was during the 2nd annual Bucks Block Party on June 18, 2016.&lt;ref name="BucksArenaGroundbreaking" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Rick|last=Romell|title=Arena groundbreaking brings enthusiasm for Bucks|url=http://archive.jsonline.com/news/milwaukee/arena-groundbreaking-brings-enthusiasm-for-bucks-b99746853z1-383524271.html|website=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|date=June 18, 2016|accessdate=January 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 2, 2017, Milwaukee Bucks President Peter Feigin stated that construction of the arena remained on schedule and on budget. Feigin's announcement was from the site of the new arena, after the first roof truss was installed and bolted into place. The roof was officially topped off on August 24, 2017. On August 26, 2018, Fiserv Forum was officially opened in a ribbon-cutting ceremony at the 4th annual Bucks Block Party. The first live event at Fiserv Forum was [[The Killers]] with [[Violent Femmes]] on September 4, 2018.&lt;ref name="wisconsinesc1"&gt;{{cite web|author=7:00 pm |url=http://wisconsinesc.com/event/kevin-hart |title=Tickets - Kevin Hart: The Irresponsible Tour - Milwaukee, WI - Wisconsin Entertainment and Sports Center - September 13, 2018 19:00:00 |publisher=Wisconsinesc.com |date= |accessdate=May 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Bucks played their inaugural game at the Fiserv Forum during the preseason against the [[Chicago Bulls]] on October 3, 2018. They won the game 116–82.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Matt|last=Velazquez|title=Bucks break in Fiserv Forum in style during preseason opener|url=https://www.jsonline.com/story/sports/nba/bucks/2018/10/03/bucks-break-fiserv-forum-style-during-preseason-opener/1503945002/|website=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|date=October 3, 2018|accessdate=October 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their regular season home opener was played on October 19, 2018, against the [[Indiana Pacers]].

===Naming rights===
Local companies including [[Johnson Controls]], [[Miller Brewing]], [[Harley-Davidson]], and [[BMO Harris Bank]] have agreed to be partners with the Bucks, but not for naming rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nelson|first=James B.|url=https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/2017/10/09/peter-feigin-puts-international-spin-pitch-fothe-milwaukee-bucks-have-growing-international-followin/746198001/|title=Peter Feigin puts international spin on pitch for Milwaukee Bucks arena naming rights|newspaper=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]|date=October 9, 2017|accessdate=July 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Heitner|first=Darren|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/darrenheitner/2017/10/16/milwaukee-bucks-want-naming-rights-sponsor-at-7-10-million-per-year/#4dd09ae07f24|title=Milwaukee Bucks Want Naming Rights Sponsor At $7-10 Million Per Year|magazine=[[Forbes]]|date=October 16, 2017|accessdate=July 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 26, 2018, the Bucks agreed to a 25-year naming rights deal with [[Fiserv]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fiserv Forum is the New Home of the Milwaukee Bucks|url=https://www.nba.com/bucks/news/fiserv-forum-new-home-milwaukee-bucks|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=Bucks.com|date=July 26, 2018|accessdate=July 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nelson|first1=James B.|title=Milwaukee Bucks and Fiserv Co. strike 25-year naming rights deal for new downtown arena|url=https://www.jsonline.com/story/sports/nba/bucks/2018/07/26/milwaukee-bucks-arena-name-fiserv-forum/564493002/|newspaper=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]|date=July 26, 2018|accessdate=July 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the official name was announced, fans nicknamed the building the "Four-One-Forum", a reference to [[Area code 414|the city's area code]].&lt;ref name="freaked"/&gt;&lt;ref name="toomuchmetal"/&gt;

==Planning and design==
The Milwaukee Bucks released the first images and details of their vision for the development of a new multi-purpose arena and sports and entertainment district to revitalize downtown Milwaukee on April 8, 2015. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Park East and designs for arena|url=http://www.jsonline.com/multimedia/photos/designs-for-bucks-arena-and-park-east-b99477503z1-299060771.html|accessdate=April 8, 2015|publisher=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel}}&lt;/ref&gt;The images depicted early conceptual drawings of a new multi-purpose venue and entertainment district that will anchor a new development vision activated by sports, entertainment, residential and office uses. The site, which primarily sits between 4th Street and 6th Street from State Street to McKinley Avenue, will seamlessly link with active development on all sides, including Old World Third Street, Schlitz Park, The Brewery, the Milwaukee riverfront, Water Street and the Wisconsin Center.

Populous and HNTB, two firms from Kansas City, lead the arena design team with participation from Milwaukee firm Eppstein Uhen.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bizjournals.com/milwaukee/news/2015/02/25/milwaukeebucks-name-eppstein-uhen-populous-hntb-as.html&lt;/ref&gt; The arena is intended to be the focal point of a "live block" zone that includes public space surrounded by both commercial and residential development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=About Mary Louise Schumacher |url=http://www.jsonline.com/entertainment/arts/design-for-new-bucks-arena-aims-to-embrace-idea-of-modern-architecture-b99477604z1-299081621.html |title=Design for new Bucks arena aims to 'embrace idea of modern architecture' |publisher=Jsonline.com |date=April 8, 2015 |accessdate=July 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initial renderings of the arena showed a transparent facade and a curved roof and side meant to evoke the water forms of nearby [[Lake Michigan]] and the [[Milwaukee River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisn.com/sports/early-design-of-new-milwaukee-bucks-arena/32254994 |title=Early design of new Milwaukee Bucks arena |publisher=Wisn.com |date=April 8, 2015 |accessdate=July 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fiserv Forum holds 17,500 people and has fewer luxury suites, but more club seating than the [[Bradley Center|BMO Harris Bradley Center]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bizjournals.com/milwaukee/news/2016/04/23/club-seats-will-outweigh-suites-at-new.html&lt;/ref&gt;

It also features a layout and equipment for an [[National Hockey League|NHL]]/[[NCAA]]-regulation [[ice hockey]] rink and [[ice show]]s such as ''[[Disney on Ice]]'', thus it still will be able to host the [[NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Championship|NCAA Frozen Four]] as the BMO Harris Bradley Center did in the past in 1993, 1997 and 2006. However, the [[American Hockey League]]'s [[Milwaukee Admirals]] returned to the [[UW–Milwaukee Panther Arena]] in the 2016-17 season as they were not approached to play games in the arena. The Bucks are contractually bound not to recruit current tenants of the Panther Arena to move their events to the Fiserv Forum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/milwaukee/news/2016/04/25/milwaukeebucks-arena-will-include-ice-rink-to-host.html|title=Milwaukee Bucks arena will include ice rink to host NHL, NCAA games|last=Kirchen|first=Rich|date=April 25, 2016|work=[[American City Business Journals|Milwaukee Business Journal]]|accessdate=April 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7161">[[File:2013 Basque Pelota World Cup - Frontenis - France vs Spain 25.jpg|right|thumb|Frontenis match]]

'''Frontenis''' is a [[sport]] that is played in a 30 meter [[Fronton (court)|pelota court]] using [[racquet]]s (a [[tennis]] racquet or a similar frontenis racquet) and rubber balls.  It can be played in pairs or singles, but only pairs frontenis is played in international competitions. This sport was developed in [[Mexico]] around 1900, and is accredited as a [[Basque pelota]] speciality.

In frontenis, one player of the pair hits the ball with the racquet toward the front wall.  The ball must strike the playable surface of the front wall and return to the playable area of the court.  The opposing players must strike the ball before it bounces a second time on the floor of the court. As with other racquet sports, the best stroke is one that the opponent cannot return.  Frontenis demands having a great mobility, skill, physical agility, mental agility, coordination and training.

For many years, frontenis was played only in [[Mexico]], [[Spain]], [[Argentina]], and a few other countries, but now it is played in approximately eighteen countries worldwide.

==History==
Frontenis was created in Mexico in 1900. Several famous tennis players (Buttlin, Sharp, Crowle, Pérez Verdia, Maldonado, Clifford, etc.) started playing with rackets and a tennis ball hitting it against a wall. This new game, with its first modern pelota court, built in Fernando Torreblanca’s house (Mexico), was called “frontontenis” (from ''fronton'' and ''tenis'' — “pelota court” and “tennis” in Spanish, respectively), and later its name was reduced to “frontenis”.

Because of the increase of the number of pelota players, pelota courts proliferated, and frontenis expanded from Mexico to neighboring countries and later to Europe. Frontenis was introduced into the [[Iberian Peninsula]] in the 1940s by way of the [[Canary Islands]]. In the 1960s, Olympic ball was introduced in Mexico, and many Mexican players travelled to Spain to teach the technique. The game and all its innovations were taken from Spain to the other countries of Europe.

Every European country that plays pelota is member of the [[Union of European Basque Pelota Federations]] (UEBPF), and all the countries that play Basque pelota are members of the [[International Federation of Basque Pelota]] (IFBP).

Frontenis (recognized by the IFBP) started being played in international competitions in 1952, with the First World Championship held in [[Donostia-San Sebastian]] (Spain).

== The rules ==

Frontenis has its own rules, like every sport. There are international rules, national rules and territorial rules, and they differ from each other in several things.

== The court ==

{{Main|Fronton (court)}}
[[Image:FRONTENIS1.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Frontenis Court]]
The court used in frontenis is a [[Fronton (court)|pelota court]] of the Very Short type — 30 meters long, 10 meters wide and 10 meters high. Its walls must have signs to establish the distances of service, and to help the player to situate itself in the court. There are several parts that form the court:

=== Front wall (frontis) ===
This is the wall at the front of the court faced by the players. Every ball hit by a player must strike this wall before touching the ground to be valid. The front wall measures 10 meters wide by 10 meters high. The lower 60 centimeters of this wall is not a legally playable surface.  The upper limit of this non-playable surface is covered with a 10-centimeter-wide metallic sheet (''chapa'' in Spanish, ''txapa'' in Basque) that audibly indicates an impact on the upper part of the non-playable surface.

=== Left wall or help wall ===
The wall is to the players' left as they face the front wall.  It is marked with lines every 3.5 meters, measured from the front of the court.  On its upper rim is located a 10 centimeter wide metallic sheet that signals a ball striking outside of the playable area. This wall with its markings helps players situate themselves within the court.

=== Rebound wall ===

It is the wall situated in the back of the court. It has no markings and is the same size as the front wall. It has 10 centimeter metallic sheets on its rims to give an audible indication of a ball striking outside of the playable area. Many pelota courts lack this wall, and are therefore not used for official competitions.

== The racket and the strings ==

The racquet used in frontenis is, according to Spanish Pelota Federation (SPF), “similar or equal to tennis racquets, made of wood, fiber, metal or graphite. Weight and stringing are not limited, and double strings can be used. The racquets' length and width are not limited.”

Racquets have evolved considerably since the beginning of professional frontenis in 1900.  Much of this evolution has paralleled standard tennis racquets

At first, racquets were made of wood and the strings were made of animal gut. These were very heavy and did not provide comfortable play, but they were used for more than thirty years until the great player Jose, the “Poison” Becerra revolutionized the sport. Manufacturers that made tennis products started to manufacture parallel products for frontenis when Becerra started to win championships. In the 1990s a Mexican company, “Master Pro”, was created exclusively to manufacture frontenis products. Recently, other companies have appeared specializing in frontenis equipment.

Simple strings is used in Preolympic frontenis, and the tension varies depending on the ball — Penn strings require 15-19 kilos, VIP strings require 17-21 kilos, and Champion Elite strings requie 17-23 kilos. Double strings (duplication of 4 horizontal strings and 3 vertical strings) are used in Olympic frontenis in order to give more effect to the ball. Double stringing demands higher tensions, between 21 and 27 kilos.

== The ball ==

The ball in Olympic frontenis (the only modality accepted by the [[IFBP]]) is the Olympic ball.

Originally, the sport was played with ordinary tennis balls, but the fiber cover of these balls slowed them excessively, reduced their bounce, and made the game very slow. To speed the game, the fabric cover of the tennis balls was removed.  Later, balls made of oilcloth were imported from England and the United States with the goal of further speeding the game.

During the [[Second World War]], ball imports ceased, and Francisco Beltran was forced to look for substitutes. He experimented with pressurizing rubber balls. After the Second World War, Beltran started manufacturing improved balls.

A few years later the first frontenis ball company, “201”, was founded by Francisco Beltran who contributed his ball designs and Doctor Jesus Ledezma who provided financing. Ball design continues to evolve.

[[Wrestling]] and [[grappling]] sports have a long and complicated history, stretching into prehistoric times. 
Many traditional forms survive, grouped under the term [[folk wrestling]]. 
More formal systems have been codified in various forms of [[martial arts]] worldwide, where [[grappling]] techniques form a significant subset of [[Unarmed combat|unarmed fighting]] (complemented by [[Strike (attack)|striking techniques]]).

The modern '''history of wrestling''' begins with a rise of popularity in the 19th century, which led to the development of the modern sports of  [[Greco-Roman wrestling]] on the European continent and of [[freestyle wrestling]] and [[collegiate wrestling]] in Great Britain and the United States, respectively. 
These sports enjoyed enormous popularity at the turning of the 20th century. In the 1920s, show wrestling as a form of [[sports entertainment]], now known as [[professional wrestling]], separated from competitive sport wrestling, now known as [[amateur wrestling]].

Wrestling as a type of [[mock combat]] and [[display behaviour]] among males has anthropological roots, and is also seen in non-human [[Great ape|Great Apes]]. 
Its documented history however necessarily begins with the history of pictorial representations.

This continued into the Hellenistic period. [[Ptolemy II]] and [[Ptolemy III]] of Egypt were both depicted in art as victorious wrestlers.

== Viking Age Scandinavia ==

[[Glíma]] is the name of the [[Scandinavia]]n [[martial art]] used by the [[Viking]]s. The word glíma in [[Old Norse]] means glimpse or flash, which describes the systems techniques. Glima as a sport covers several types of Scandinavian [[folk wrestling]]: [[Lausatök]], Hryggspenna, and Brokartök. Glima was the most widespread sport in the [[Viking Age]] (800AD-c. 1050), and was practiced by men and women of all ages. Wherever Vikings gathered, Glima was a big part of the entertainment. Glima was so important for Viking society that their most popular god, [[Thor]], was also the Viking god of wrestling. ''Glima'' is first mentioned in 9th century Viking poetry about the Norse god Thor and his journey to Utgards-Loki, where [[Elli]] defeats Thor in a [[wrestling]] match. Glima in Iceland is almost unchanged since Viking times. The original Norwegian settlers in [[Iceland]] took Viking wrestling and the Glima combat systems with them, according to the [[Jónsbók]] law book from 1325, and the book of laws known as [[Grágás]], which refers to a collection of earlier Norwegian laws with rules for Viking wrestling.

== Medieval and Early Modern Europe ==
{{further|Ringen}}
[[Image:Sweerts, Michael -1649- - Wrestling Match.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Michiel Sweerts]], ''Wrestling Match'', 1649.]]
There is ample evidence of wrestling practiced throughout medieval Europe, both by the nobility and the lower classes. 
Wrestling remained popular during the Renaissance, and for much of the 16th century.
In 1520 at the [[Field of the Cloth of Gold]] pageant, [[Francis I of France]] threw [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] of England in a wrestling shoes match.&lt;ref name = 1193Poliakoff/&gt; 
In [[Henry VIII]]'s kingdom,  wrestling in many places was widely popular and had a long history.

The [[German school of fencing|German tradition]] has records of a number of master-''[[Ringen|Ringer]]'' of the 15th to 16th centuries specializing in unarmed combat. Unarmed combat was divided in two categories, sportive grappling or ''geselliges ringen'' and serious unarmed combat or ''kampfringen'' (where ''kampf'' is the [[Early Modern German]] term for "[[duel]]").
While sportive grappling had fixed rules that prohibited dangerous techniques, usually starting in [[grappling hold]] and ending with a [[throw (grappling)|throw]] or [[Submission (combat sports)|submission]],
''kampfringen'' can be considered a system of unarmed [[self-defense]] including    [[Punch (combat)|punches]], [[joint-locks]], [[elbow strike]]s, [[chokehold]]s, [[headbutt]]s and (to a limited extent) [[kick]]s.

One of the primary men to have shaped kampfringen at the dawning of the German Renaissance appears to have been Austrian master Ott Jud.  He is said to have developed a system of grappling to be used in combat, including joint breaks, arm locks and throws designed to cause serious injury. No treatise from Ott's own hand has survived, but his system is taught by several fencing masters of the later 15th century.
[[Paulus Kal]] counts him among the "society of [[Liechtenauer]]", saying that he was wrestling teacher to the "lords of [[Habsburg Austria|Austria]]".&lt;ref&gt;''Maister ott jud der der hern von osterrich ringer gewessen yst'' ([https://books.google.com/books?id=Qq4AAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA244&amp;dq=%22Ott+Jud%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=L98NTriaFMOV8QOSoey4Dg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwADgU#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Ott%20Jud%22&amp;f=false k. k. Ambraser-Sammlung], ca. 1470)&lt;/ref&gt; (possibly under [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III]]).&lt;ref&gt;Welle 1993, p.&amp;nbsp;259&lt;/ref&gt;
Other treatises that contain material both on ''ringen'' and on swordsmanship include those of  [[Fiore dei Liberi]] (c. 1410), [[Fabian von Auerswald]] (1462), [[Pietro Monte]] (c. 1480), and [[Hans Wurm]] (c. 1500).

It was only with the beginning [[Early Modern period]], specifically the more "dignified" code of behaviour the upper classes imposed on themselves in the [[Baroque period]] that wrestling was abandoned by European nobility, and it became a pastime of rural populations, developing into the various surviving forms of European [[folk wrestling]]. 
A late treatise on ''ringen'' is that by Johann Georg Passchen, published in 1659.&lt;ref&gt;''Vollständiges Ring-Buch / darinnen angewiesen wird / wie man Adversarium recht sol angreiffen / sich lossmachen / die schläge pariren / unterschiedliche Lectiones und die contra-Lectiones darauff machen / mit Fleiß beschrieben und mit vielen nothwendigen kupffern außgebildet.'' 1659, reprint 1663  Halle (S.), Melchior Oelschlägel; [http://jwma.ejmas.com/articles/2000/jwmaart_steenput_1200.html English translation by Eli Steenput], Journal of Western Martial Art, November 2000 [http://www.thearma.org/Manuals/Passchen/Passchen.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Maybe the last book which deals with Ringen as a deadly martial art, is possibly "Leib-beschirmende und Feinden Trotz-bietende Fecht-Kunst" from Johann Andreas Schmidt, which was published in Weigel, Nürnberg in 1713.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital.bibliothek.uni-halle.de/hd/content/pageview/102714|title=343 [319]  - Das VI.

==In the Middle East==
{{further|Varzesh-e Pahlavani}}
Many of the world's oldest depictions of wrestling can be found in the Middle East. Carvings and statues show that forms of belt wrestling existed in the region since ancient times, in addition to matches between humans and animals. Wrestling is also mentioned in the epics of [[Gilgamesh]] and the [[Shahnameh]]. Oil wrestling as practiced in present-day Turkey and Central Asia is recorded in ancient Sumeria and Babylon. In Persia, Pahlavani traditional grappling or koshti (کشتی) was practiced by both the upper and lower classes both for sport and as training for battle. In training halls known as ''zourkhaneh'', soldiers practiced resistance exercises and grappling in a tradition now called [[Pahlevani and zoorkhaneh rituals|varzesh-e bastani]] (ورزش باستانی; lit. "ancient athletics"). Ancient Iranian combat-wrestling (''koshti-ye jangi'') included not only grabs but also punches and low kicks. As Iranian influence spread with the [[Achaemenid Empire]] and later the [[Persian Empire]], the practice was adopted in the [[Indian subcontient]] as [[pehlwani]].

==In Asia==

===China===
{{further|Shuai jiao}}
Classical Chinese wrestling or ''jiao li'' (角力) was a public sport in the [[Qin Dynasty]] (221-207 BC) held for court amusement as well as for recruiting the best fighters. Competitors wrestled each other on a raised platform called a [[lei tai]]. The term ''shuai jiao'' was chosen by the [[Central Guoshu Academy]] of [[Nanjing]] in 1928 when competition rules began to be standardized.

===Indian subcontinent===
{{further|Malla-yuddha|Pehlwani}}
Wrestling in the [[Indian subcontinent]] was differentiated into four types that progressed from sport (''malakride'') to combat (''[[malla-yuddha]]''). Mughal conquerors introduced more groundwork and referred to their grappling style as [[pehlwani|kusti]]. Competitors still wrestle as in ancient times, on dirt floors while wearing only [[kowpeenam]] or loincloth.

===Japan===
{{further|Jujitsu#History}}
The term ''[[jūjutsu]]'' was  coined in the 17th century, after which time it became a blanket term for a wide variety of grappling-related disciplines in [[Japanese martial arts]]. Prior to that time, these skills had names such as {{Nihongo|"short sword grappling"|小具足腰之廻|kogusoku koshi no mawari}}, {{Nihongo|"grappling"|組討 or 組打|kumiuchi}}, {{Nihongo|"body art"|体術|taijutsu}}, {{Nihongo|"softness"|柔 or 和|yawara}}, {{Nihongo|"art of harmony"|和術|wajutsu, ৳yawarajutsu}}, {{Nihongo|"catching hand"|捕手|torite}}, and even the {{Nihongo|"way of softness"|柔道|jūdō}} (as early as 1724, almost two centuries before Kanō Jigorō founded the modern art of Kodokan [[Judo]]).&lt;ref name="classical_fighting_arts_of_japan"&gt;{{Citation

==Modern history==

===Development of modern wrestling===
The [[Lancashire wrestling|Lancashire]] style of [[folk wrestling]] may have formed the basis for [[Catch wrestling]] also known as "catch as catch can." 
The [[Scottish people|Scots]] later formed a variant of this style, and the [[Ireland|Irish]] developed the "[[collar-and-elbow]]" style which later found its way into the United States.&lt;ref name = 1190Poliakoff&gt;{{cite book|last1=Poliakoff|first1=Michael|editor1-last=Levinson|editor1-first=David|editor2-last=Christensen|editor2-first=Karen|title=Encyclopedia of World Sport: From Ancient Times to the Present (Vol. 3)|date=1996|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, CA|isbn=0-87436-819-7|pages=1190|chapter=Wrestling, Freestyle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wrestling as a modern sport developed in the 19th century out of traditions of [[folk wrestling]], emerging in the form of two styles of regulated competitive sport, "[[Freestyle wrestling|freestyle]]" and "[[Greco-Roman wrestling#History|Greco-Roman]]" wrestling (based on British and continental tradition, respectively), now{{year needed|date=May 2014}} summarized under the term "[[amateur wrestling]]" by the beginning of the [[Olympic sport|modern Olympics]].

A tradition of combining wrestling and showmanship originates in [[July Monarchy|1830s France]], when showmen presented wrestlers under names such as “Edward, the steel eater”, “Gustave d’Avignon, the bone wrecker”, or “Bonnet, the ox of the low Alps” and challenged members of the public to knock them down for 500 [[French franc#French Empire and Restoration|franc]]s.&lt;ref name="FILA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fila-official.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=14&amp;Itemid=100246&amp;lang=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011195312/http://fila-official.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=14&amp;Itemid=100246&amp;lang=en|dead-url=yes|archive-date=11 October 2011|title=Roots and history of Olympic wrestling|last=Anon|work=International Federation of Associated Wrestling Styles|publisher=FILA|accessdate=2 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 1848, French showman, Jean Exbroyat formed the first modern wrestlers’ circus troupe and established a rule not to execute holds below the waist&amp;nbsp;— a style he named "flat hand wrestling". This new style soon spread to the rest of Europe, the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], Italy, Denmark and Russia under the names of [[Greco-Roman wrestling]], Classic wrestling or French wrestling.

===Golden Age (1890&amp;ndash;1914)===
{{anchor|Golden Age}}
By the end of the 19th century, this modern  "Greco-Roman" wrestling style went on to become the most in fashionable sport in Europe. Because of that and the rise of [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasiums]] and [[Sports club|athletic clubs]], Greco-Roman wrestling and modern freestyle wrestling were soon regulated in formal competitions.  On continental Europe, prize money was offered in large sums to the winners of Greco-Roman tournaments, and freestyle wrestling spread rapidly in the United Kingdom and in the United States.

[[Image:Wrestling match during 1904 Summer Olympics.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Wrestling at the [[wrestling at the 1904 Summer Olympics|1904 Summer Olympics]].]]
A "Golden Age" for the sport followed, cut short with the breakout of [[World War I]] in 1914.
In 1898 the Frenchman [[Paul Pons|Paul Pons, “the Colossus”]] became the first Professional World Champion.&lt;ref name="FILA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last =[[International Federation of Associated Wrestling Styles]]| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =Greco-Roman Wrestling| work =| publisher =[[International Federation of Associated Wrestling Styles|FILA]]| date =| url =http://www.fila-official.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=18&amp;Itemid=36| format =| doi =| accessdate =2007-08-09| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20110711000658/http://www.fila-official.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=18&amp;Itemid=36| archivedate =2011-07-11| df =}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Leading wrestlers during this time, such as  [[Georg Hackenschmidt]], [[Stanislaus Zbyszko]], [[William Muldoon]],  [[Frank Gotch]], [[Constant Lavaux]], had the status of popular heroes.&lt;ref name = 1190Poliakoff/&gt;&lt;ref name = 1194Poliakoff&gt;{{cite book|last1=Poliakoff|first1=Michael|editor1-last=Levinson|editor1-first=David|editor2-last=Christensen|editor2-first=Karen|title=Encyclopedia of World Sport: From Ancient Times to the Present (Vol. 3)|date=1996|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, CA|isbn=0-87436-819-7|pages=1189–1193|chapter=Wrestling, Freestyle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, wrestling was dominated by [[Martin Burns|Martin "Farmer" Burns]] and his pupil, [[Frank Gotch]]. Burns was renowned as a competitive wrestler, who, despite never weighing more than 160 pounds during his wrestling career, fought over 6,000 wrestlers (at a time when most were competitive contests) and lost fewer than 10 of them.&lt;ref name=hooker-ch3&gt;{{cite book|last=Thesz|first=Lou|title=Hooker|chapter=Chapter 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also gained a reputation for training some of the best wrestlers of the era, including Gotch, known as one of America's first sports superstars.&lt;ref name=hooker-ch3/&gt; Gotch, regarded as "peerless" at his peak, was the first to actually claim the world's undisputed heavyweight championship by beating all contenders in North America and Europe. He became the world's champion by beating European wrestling champion [[Georg Hackenschmidt]], both in 1908 and 1911, seen by modern wrestling historians as two of the most significant matches in wrestling history.

Professional wrestlers during this time would participate both in sportive competition and in shows focusing more on spectacle and  entertainment, as wrestling was introduced to the public as part of a [[variety act]] to spice up the limited action involved in the bodybuilder [[High striker|strongman]] attractions. One of its earliest stars was a  Cornish-American ex-miner named [[Jack Carkeek]], who would challenge audience members to last 10 minutes with him. It is in this period that the origin between the later division between "[[professional wrestling]]" (non-competitive acrobatics and showmanship) and "[[amateur wrestling]]" (competitive) originates. 
[[Georg Hackenschmidt]], world champion after his 1905 win over [[Tom Jenkins (wrestler)|Tom Jenkins]],  associated himself with British promoter and entrepreneur Charles B. Cochran.  Hackenschmidt took a series of bookings in [[Manchester]] for a then-impressive £150 a week. Noting Hackenschmidt's dominant style of wrestling threatened to kill crowd interest, Cochran persuaded Hackenschmidt to learn showmanship from Cannon and wrestle many of his matches for entertainment rather than sport; this displayed the future elements of [[sports entertainment]].

The separation of  "[[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Work (noun)|worked]]", i.e. purely performative, choreographed wrestling from competitive sport begins in the 1920s.
The success of the more [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Work (noun)|worked]] aspects of professional wrestling in America, like [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Gimmick|gimmickry]] and [[Professional wrestling holds|submission holds]], were introduced to British wrestling. Amateur wrestler, [[Atholl Oakley|Sir Atholl Oakley]] got together with fellow grappler Henry Irslinger to launch one of the first promotions to employ the new style of wrestling which was coined "[[All-in wrestling]]".   The great demand for wrestling meant there were not enough skilled amateurs to go around, and many promoters switched to more [[Hardcore wrestling|violent styles]], with weapons and chairshots part of the proceedings. Women wrestlers and mud-filled rings also became commonplace.  In the late 1930s, the [[London County Council]] banned professional wrestling.

When the [[1896 Olympics|First Modern Olympic Games]] held in   [[Athens]] in 1896, Greco-Roman wrestling was introduced as an Olympic discipline. After not being featured in the [[1900 Olympics]], sports wrestling was seen again in 1904 in [[Saint Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]]; this time in freestyle competition. Since then, Greco-Roman and freestyle wrestling have both been featured (with women's freestyle added in the Summer Olympics of 2004).

===Interwar period and later 20th century===
The popularity of wrestling experienced a dramatic decline in 1915 to 1920, north due to the World War, and as its reputation had suffered especially among the American public because of widespread doubt of its legitimacy and status as a competitive sport.

Following the retirement of Frank Gotch, professional wrestling in the United States (except in the Midwest) was losing popularity fast. In response, three professional wrestlers, [[Ed Lewis (wrestler)|Ed Lewis]], [[Billy Sandow]], and [[Toots Mondt]], joined to form their own promotion in the 1920s, modifying their in-ring product to attract fans. The three were referred to as the "[[Gold Dust Trio]]" due to their financial success. 
This marks the beginning of "[[professional wrestling]]" as an entertainment industry separate from competitive wrestling, and to a revival of public interest in wrestling in the [[interwar period]].
Wrestling did not, however, rise to its pre-war level of popularity again, being eclipsed by [[Boxing]], which sport now experienced [[Boxing in the 1920s|its own Golden Age]].

Since 1921, the [[International Federation of Associated Wrestling Styles|International Federation of Associated Wrestling Styles (FILA)]] has regulated [[amateur wrestling]] as an athletic discipline.
In 1927, [[Raymond G. Clapp|Dr. Raymond G. Clapp]] published the rules for [[collegiate wrestling]], and the next year, the first [[NCAA Wrestling Team Championship]] took place on March 30 to March 31 on the campus of [[Iowa State University|Iowa State College]]. The rules of collegiate wrestling marked a sharp contrast to the freestyle wrestling rules of the [[International Federation of Associated Wrestling Styles|International Amateur Wrestling Federation]] (IAWF) and the [[Amateur Athletic Union|AAU]].&lt;ref name="1191Poliakoff" /&gt;  From then on, collegiate wrestling emerged as a distinctly American sport. College and high school wrestling grew especially after the standardization of the NCAA wrestling rules, which applied early on to both collegiate and scholastic wrestling (with high school modifications). More colleges, universities, and junior colleges began offering dual meets and tournaments, including championships and having organized wrestling seasons. There were breaks in wrestling seasons because of [[World War II]], but in the high schools especially, state association wrestling championships sprung up in different regions throughout the 1930s and 1940s. As amateur wrestling grew after World War II, various collegiate athletic conferences also increased the number and quality of their wrestling competition, with more wrestlers making the progression of wrestling in high school, being recruited by college coaches, and then entering the collegiate competition.

[[File:Davangere Wrestlers.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Pehlwani]]-style wrestling match in [[Davangere]], [[Karnataka, India]] (2005).]]
Both  [[freestyle wrestling]] and  its American counterpart, [[collegiate wrestling]], did not have a scoring system that decided matches in the absence of a fall until the introduction of a point system by [[Oklahoma State University]] wrestling coach [[Art Griffith]] that gained acceptance in 1941, and influenced the international styles as well. By the 1960s international wrestling matches in Greco-Roman and freestyle were scored by a panel of three judges in secret, who made the final decision by raising colored paddles at the match's end. [[Albert de Ferrari|Dr. Albert de Ferrari]] from [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] who became vice president of FILA, lobbied for a visible scoring system and a rule for "controlled fall", which would recognize a fall only when the offensive wrestler had done something to cause it. These were soon adopted internationally in Greco-Roman and freestyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The '''Haifa Municipal Stadium''' ({{lang-he-n|אצטדיון העירוני חיפה}}, ''Etztadion HaIroni Haifa''), more commonly known as '''Kiryat Eliezer''' ({{Hebrew|קריית אליעזר}}), was a multi-use [[stadium]] in the [[Kiryat Eliezer, Haifa|Kiryat Eliezer]] neighborhood of [[Haifa]], [[Israel]]. It was mostly used for [[association football|football]] matches and as the home stadium of [[Maccabi Haifa F.C.|Maccabi Haifa]] and [[Hapoel Haifa FC|Hapoel Haifa]]. It was  replaced by the new [[Sammy Ofer Stadium]] at the southern entrance to the city in 2014.

==Background==
The stadium was built in 1955, as a gift from the [[Italian Labour Union]]. It seats 14,002 among its 14 gates. Ownership of the stadium belonged to the [[Haifa|Municipality of Haifa]], though it was managed by a suborganization called ETHOS. The stadium was officially opened on 14 September 1955, with a match between Haifa XI and Tel Aviv XI.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.football.org.il/multimedia/PDF/Newspapers/hadashot/1955/09-15-1955.pdf Haifa–Tel Aviv 3:3] Hadshot HaSport, 15 September 1955, p. 11 {{he icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 September 1955 the first [[Haifa derby]] was played at the stadium, with Maccabi beating Hapoel 4-1.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.football.org.il/multimedia/PDF/Newspapers/hadashot/1955/09-25-1955.pdf The Haifa Derby Was Settled Within 25 Minutes] Hadshot HaSport, 25 September 1955, p. 8 {{he icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both clubs had previously played at [[Thomas D'Alesandro Stadium|Kiryat Haim Stadium]] in the [[HaKerayot|Kerayot]] area of [[Haifa]]. The first match played at the stadium, while it was being built, was held during the [[Football at the 1953 Maccabiah Games|1953 Maccabiah Games]], between Israel and Finland.&lt;ref name="mac"&gt;[http://jhpress.nli.org.il/Default/Scripting/ArticleWin.asp?From=Archive&amp;Source=Page&amp;Skin=TAUHe&amp;BaseHref=DAV/1953/10/02&amp;PageLabelPrint=&amp;EntityId=Ar02200&amp;ViewMode=HTML Stadium on the Way] Davar, 2 October 1953, Historical Jewish Press {{he icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium did not meet [[UEFA]]'s highest standards forcing the clubs in [[Haifa]] to host their European matches in the [[Tel Aviv]] area. At certain times, UEFA also has limited clubs from outside the Tel Aviv area from hosting even low level European qualifiers citing security concerns.

Kiryat Eliezer was the only stadium in [[Israel]] equipped with electronic gates in an effort to curb scalping and the sale of counterfeit tickets. Regulars to the stadium could have purchased a card for 10 [[New Israeli Sheqel|shekels]], which can be refilled for specific matches held at the stadium.

There was one scoreboard in the stadium, which did not had a replay screen. The only television in the stadium, outside of the television broadcast booth, was in front of the seat of [[Ya'akov Shahar]], the owner of Maccabi Haifa. Only the A section of the stadium was covered by a roof.

The last game in the stadium was played on 14 May 2014, with Maccabi Haifa hosting Maccabi Tel Aviv in the Israeli Premier League.

==Transportation==
The stadium was located in the Kiryat Eliezer neighborhood of [[Haifa]]. Adjacent to the stadium is Beit [[Egged Bus Cooperative|Egged]]. Thus the stadium was easily served by all [[Egged Bus Cooperative|Egged]] bus lines running into and out of [[Haifa]] as well as the [[Haifa Bat Galim Railway Station|Bat Galim Railway Station]], which is a central stop for all train lines running up the coast of the [[Mediterranean Sea]].

She is one of the highest-paid models in Paraguay.&lt;ref name="globo"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ego.globo.com/Gente/Noticias/0,,MUL1604459-9798,00-MUSA+DA+COPA+LARISSA+RIQUELME+E+A+MODELO+MAIS+BEM+PAGA+DO+PARAGUAI.html|title=Musa da Copa, Larissa Riquelme é a modelo mais bem paga do Paraguai |accessdate=2010-07-08 |date=2010-07-05 |work=[[O Globo]] |publisher=globo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
A famous model and actress in Paraguay, Riquelme rose to international prominence during the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref name="peck"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/soccer-dirty-tackle/larissa-riquelme-incredibly-popular-reason--soccer.html |title=Larissa Riquelme is incredibly popular for some reason |accessdate=2010-07-03 |last=Peck |first=Brooks |date=2010-06-30 |work=Dirty Tackle |publisher=Yahoo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A supporter of both the [[Paraguay national football team]] and the club [[Cerro Porteño]], she was first pictured in international media celebrating a goal during the game between Paraguay and [[Slovakia]] with her [[Nokia]] mobile phone between her [[breasts]] and she was wearing a T-shirt with Paraguay's colors (as part of a promotion for a mobile phone company&lt;ref name="peck"/&gt;). Riquelme is the face of the deodorant brand [[Axe (grooming product)|Axe]] in Paraguay&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://www.axe.com.py |title=Homepage of Axe in Paraguay |accessdate=2010-07-08 |work=Axe Paraguay |publisher=axe.compy}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at a later Paraguay game in the World Cup she was also seen with the word "Axe" written on her chest as advertising for the deodorant brand.&lt;ref name="metro"&gt;{{cite news |title=Lingerie model Larissa Riquelme to strip naked despite Paraguay defeat |newspaper=[[Metro (Associated Metro Limited)|Metro]] |date=2010-07-05 |url=http://www.metro.co.uk/sport/football/834040-lingerie-model-larissa-riquelme-to-strip-naked-despite-paraguay-defeat |accessdate=2010-07-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After becoming one of the most searched people on the Internet,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Phillips|first=Tom |title=World Cup Superfan Larissa Riquelme To Run From The Police Naked If Paraguay Wins |url= http://bleacherreport.com/articles/413240-world-cup-wag-larissa-riquelme-to-run-naked-if-paraguay-wins#page/1 |work=Bleacher Report |accessdate=22 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; she was named "World Cup's Girlfriend" by ''[[Diario Marca|Marca]]'', the largest Spanish sports newspaper.&lt;ref name="gracias"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marca.com/blogs/el-otro-mundial/2010/07/02/larissa-riquelme-gracias-a-marca-por.html |title=Larissa Riquelme: "Gracias a Marca por bautizarme 'novia del mundial'"  |accessdate=2010-07-04 |date=2010-07-02 |work=[[Diario Marca|Marca]] |publisher=Marca.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was also described as the most famous fan of the World Cup.&lt;ref name="gracias"/&gt;

Following her rise to fame, and after Argentinian coach [[Diego Maradona]] promised to run naked through [[Buenos Aires]] if Argentina won the 2010 World Cup, Riquelme matched the offer and promised that she would run naked (wearing only [[body paint]] in the colors of Paraguay) through [[Asunción]] if [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]] won the World Cup, or even if they reached the semi-finals by beating Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianews.org.in/paraguay-can-make-larissa-riquelmes-dream-come-true/archives/1676 |title=Paraguay can make Larissa Riquelme’s dream come true |accessdate=2010-07-03 |date=2010-07-03 |work=Game On! |publisher=indianews.org.in |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706065827/http://www.indianews.org.in/paraguay-can-make-larissa-riquelmes-dream-come-true/archives/1676 |archivedate=July 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Paraguay eventually lost its match against Spain, but Riquelme announced that she would fulfill her promise anyway,&lt;ref name="metro"/&gt; a promise that she kept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metro.co.uk/sport/oddballs/834495-larissa-riquelme-strips-naked-for-paraguay-as-promised |title=Model Larissa Riquelme strips naked for Paraguay - as promised |accessdate=2011-07-05 |date=2010-07-08 |work=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]] |publisher=metro.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, Riquelme did a nude pictorial for the September 2010 issue of ''[[Playboy magazine (Brazilian issue)|Playboy Brazil]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ego.globo.com/Gente/Noticias/0,,MUL1609138-9798,00-LARISSA+RIQUELME+ASSINA+CONTRATO+COM+A+PLAYBOY+E+SERA+CAPA+DE+SETEMBRO.html |title=Larissa Riquelme assina contrato com a 'Playboy' e será capa de setembro |publisher=[[Rede Globo|EGO]] |date=2010-07-26|language=Portuguese|accessdate=2011-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from modeling and acting, Riquelme has also participated in ''Bailando por un Sueño'', the Argentinian version of ''[[Dancing with the Stars]].''&lt;ref name="globo"/&gt;

The '''Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum''', often referred to as the '''Oakland Coliseum''', is a [[multi-purpose stadium]] in [[Oakland, California]], United States, which is home to both the [[Oakland Athletics]] of [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) and the [[Oakland Raiders]] of the [[National Football League]] (NFL). It opened in 1966 and is the only remaining stadium in the United States that is shared by professional football and baseball teams. The Coliseum was also home to some games of the [[San Jose Earthquakes]] of [[Major League Soccer]] in 2008–2009 and hosted games at the [[2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup]]. The Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum complex consists of the stadium and the neighboring [[Oracle Arena]].

The Coliseum has 6,300 club seats, 2,700 of which are available for Athletics games, 143 luxury suites, 125 of which are available for Athletics games, and a variable [[seating capacity]] of 47,170 for baseball, 56,057 for football, and 63,132 for [[Association football|soccer]]. In seating capacity, Oakland Coliseum is the second [[List of current National Football League stadiums|smallest NFL stadium]], larger only than [[StubHub Center]], the temporary home of the [[Los Angeles Chargers]], but the eighth [[List of Major League Baseball stadiums|largest MLB stadium]].

On April 3, 2017, Opening Day, the Athletics dedicated the Coliseum's playing surface as '''Rickey Henderson Field''' in honor of [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|MLB Hall of Famer]] and former Athletic [[Rickey Henderson]].

==Stadium history==

===Design===
The Coliseum features an underground design where the playing surface is actually below ground level (21 feet/6 meters below sea level). Consequently, fans entering the stadium find themselves walking on to the main concourse of the stadium at the top of the first level of seats. This, combined with the hill that was built around the stadium to create the upper concourse, means that only the third deck is visible from outside the park. This gives the Coliseum the illusion of being a short stadium from the outside.

===Planning and construction===
Business and political leaders in Oakland had long been in competition with neighbor San Francisco, as well as other cities in the West, and worked for Oakland and its suburbs (the greater [[East Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)|East Bay]]) to be recognized nationally as a viable metropolitan area with its own identity and reputation, distinct and separate from that of San Francisco. Professional sports was seen as a primary way for the East Bay to gain such recognition. As a result, the desire for a major-league caliber stadium in the city of Oakland intensified during the 1950s and 1960s.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

By 1960, a non-profit corporation was formed to oversee the financing and development of the facility (rather than city or county government issuing taxpayer-backed bonds for construction). Local real estate developer Robert T. Nahas headed this group (which included other prominent East Bay business leaders such as former US Senator [[William Knowland]] and Edgar F. Kaiser), which later became the governing board of the Coliseum upon completion. It was Nahas' idea that the Coliseum be privately financed with ownership transferring to the city and county upon retirement of the construction financing.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;''Oakland Tribune'', November 3, 1960, front page&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert T. Nahas served 20 years as President of the Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum Board.  On the death of Nahas, the ''San Francisco Chronicle'''s Rick DelVecchio quoted Jack Maltester, a former [[San Leandro, California|San Leandro]] mayor and Coliseum board member, "If not for Bob Nahas, there would be no Coliseum, it's really that simple." Nahas had to be a diplomat dealing with the egos of Raiders owner [[Al Davis]], Athletics owner [[Charles O. Finley]], and Warriors owner [[Franklin Mieuli]].

Preliminary architectural plans were unveiled in November 1960, and the following month a site was chosen west of the [[Elmhurst, Oakland, California|Elmhurst]] district of East Oakland alongside the then-recently completed [[Interstate 880|Nimitz Freeway]]. A downtown site adjacent to [[Lake Merritt]] and the Oakland Auditorium (which itself, many years later, would be renamed the [[Kaiser Convention Center|Henry J. Kaiser Convention Center]]) was also originally considered.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;  The [[Port of Oakland]] played a key role in the East Oakland site selection; The Port swapped {{convert|157|acre}} at the head of San Leandro Bay to the [[East Bay Regional Park District]], in exchange for {{convert|105|acre}} of park land across the freeway, which the Port in turn donated to the City of Oakland as the site for the Coliseum sports complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Chapter 2 – LWVO Study|url=http://www.waterfrontaction.org/learn/league/ch2.htm|publisher=Waterfront Action|accessdate=July 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Oakland Raiders]] of the [[American Football League]] moved to [[Frank Youell Field]], a makeshift stadium near [[downtown Oakland]], in 1962, and the Coliseum was already being heralded in the local media as the Raiders' future permanent home. Baseball was also a major factor in the planning of the Coliseum. As early as {{MLBy|1961}}, the [[American League]] publicly indicated that it wished to include Oakland in its West Coast expansion plans. In {{MLBy|1963}}, American League president [[Joe Cronin]] suggested that Coliseum officials model some aspects of the new ballpark after then-new [[Dodger Stadium]], which impressed him,&lt;ref&gt;''Oakland Tribune'', January 27, 1963, pg. 39E&lt;/ref&gt; though these expansion plans seemed to fade by the middle of the decade.

After approval from the city of Oakland as well as Alameda County by 1962, $25 million in financing was arranged. Plans were drawn for a stadium, an [[Oracle Arena|indoor arena]], and an exhibition hall in between them. The architect of record was the San Francisco office of [[Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill]] (with [[Myron Goldsmith]] the principal design architect&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Myron Goldsmith -- Noted Architect|first=Allan|last=Temko|url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Myron-Goldsmith-Noted-Architect-2974662.php|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=July 17, 1996|accessdate=March 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and the general contractor was Guy F. Atkinson Company. Preliminary site preparation began in the summer of 1961. Construction began in the spring of 1962. The construction schedule was delayed for two years due to various legal issues and cost overruns; the original design of the Coliseum had to be modified slightly in order to stay on budget.&lt;ref&gt;''Oakland Tribune'', April 3, 1964, page E49&lt;/ref&gt; (For details on the indoor arena, now known as Oracle Arena, refer to that facility's article.)

In {{MLBy|1965}}, it was rumored that the [[Cleveland Indians]] might leave Cleveland for a West Coast city (such as Oakland), but the Indians ended up remaining in Cleveland. [[Charlie Finley]], owner of the [[Kansas City Athletics]], unhappy in Kansas City, impressed by Oakland's new stadium and personally convinced to consider Oakland by Nahas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Robert Nahas -- He Brought Coliseum and A's to Oakland|first=Rick|last=DelVecchio|url=https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Robert-Nahas-He-brought-Coliseum-and-A-s-to-2870795.php|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=February 26, 2002|accessdate=September 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  eventually got permission after several unsuccessful attempts and amid considerable controversy, to relocate his American League franchise to the stadium for the {{MLBy|1968}} season (for details on the controversy, see the separate articles for the A's and the [[Kansas City Royals]], the expansion franchise created to replace the A's in Kansas City).

===Configurations===
In its baseball configuration, the Coliseum has the most foul territory of any ballpark in Major League Baseball. Thus, many balls that would reach the seats in other ballparks can be caught for outs at the Coliseum. The distance to the backstop was initially {{convert|90|ft|m}}, but was reduced to {{convert|60|ft|m}} in 1969.

From 1968 through 1981 and in 1995, two football configurations were used at the stadium.  During Raider preseason games and all regular season games played while the baseball season was still going on, the field was set up from home plate to center field (east/west).  Seats that were down the foul lines for baseball games became the sideline seats for football games, which started up to 120 feet away from the field (most football-only stadiums have sideline seats that start around 60 feet away).  Once the A's season ended, the orientation was switched to north/south: i.e. the football field ran from the left field line to the right field line; seats were moved from behind first and third base to create corners for the end zone to fit into (these seats were then placed to fill in the space that was normally behind home plate and near the foul poles for baseball games).  Temporary football bleachers were then added in front of the baseball bleachers to form the sideline on the east (visitors') side, and the baseball bleachers were not sold.  Raiders season ticket holders would thus have two season ticket locations in different parts of the stadium that roughly corresponded to the same location in relation to the field. Since stadium expansion in 1996, the field has run north/south throughout the season.

For more than its first three decades (1966–1998) the stadium was known as Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Oakland Coliseum Still Bears O.co Name|first=Angela|last=Woodall|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/athletics/ci_20347459/oakland-coliseum-still-bears-o-co-name|newspaper=[[The Mercury News]]|location=San Jose|date=April 7, 2012|accessdate=May 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1997, [[UMAX Technologies]] agreed to acquire the naming rights to the stadium. However, following a dispute, a court decision reinstated the Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum name. In 1998, [[Network Associates]] agreed to pay US$5.8 million over 5 years for the naming rights and the stadium became known as Network Associates Coliseum, or, alternately in marketing and media usage as, "the Net".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New Name in Oakland Sports: Overstock.com Coliseum|first1=Phillip|last1=Matier|first2=Andrew|last2=Ross|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2011/04/26/BAJS1J7VNM.DTL|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=May 12, 2011|accessdate=May 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Network Associates renewed the contract in 2003 for an additional five years at a cost of $6 million. In mid-2004, Network Associates was renamed [[McAfee]], restoring its name from before its 1997 merger with [[NetScout Systems, Inc.|Network General]], and the stadium was renamed McAfee Coliseum accordingly.

McAfee was offered a renewal of the naming contract in 2008, but it was declined. The name reverted to the pre-1997 name of Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum on September 19, 2008. The stadium retained its original name until April 27, 2011, when it was renamed Overstock.com Coliseum via a 6-year, $7.2 million naming rights deal with online retailer [[Overstock.com]].

The Coliseum was renamed O.co Coliseum on June 6, 2011, after Overstock.com's marketing name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About Us: History|url=http://www.coliseum.com/info/history.php|publisher=ORACLE Arena &amp; Oakland Alameda Coliseum|accessdate=September 20, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110919110056/http://www.coliseum.com/info/history.php|archivedate=September 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About SMG|url=http://www.smgworld.com/company_history.aspx?un=1|publisher=SMG|accessdate=September 20, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110922150546/http://www.smgworld.com/company_history.aspx?un=1|archivedate=September 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=SMG At-a-Glance: Stadiums|url=http://www.smgworld.com/stadiums.aspx|publisher=SMG|accessdate=September 20, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110925152425/http://www.smgworld.com/stadiums.aspx|archivedate=September 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to a contract dispute with the Athletics regarding the Overstock/O.co naming rights deal, the A's continued to refer to the stadium as the Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum in all official team communications and on team websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Athletics: No go for O.co|first=Kevin|last=Reichard|url=http://www.ballparkdigest.com/201204094693/major-league-baseball/news/athletics-no-go-for-oco|work=Ballpark Digest|publisher=August Publications|date=April 9, 2012|accessdate=October 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overstock opted out of the final year on their naming rights deal on April 2, 2016, and the stadium once again became the Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Oakland Alameda Coliseum Naming Rights Available|url=http://www.coliseum.com/news/detail/the-oakland-alameda-county-coliseum-naming-rights-available|publisher=ORACLE Arena &amp; Oakland Alameda Coliseum|date=April 4, 2016|accessdate=April 10, 2016|quote=Until further notice, the Joint Powers Authority requests that the facility be referred to as 'The Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum', by the media and in all public communications.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Overstock.com Opts Out of Naming Rights with O.co Coliseum|first=Rhea|last=Mahbubani|url=http://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/Overstockcom-Opts-out-of-Naming-Rights-with-O-co-Coliseum-374371321.html|work=[[KNTV]]|location=San Francisco|date=April 2, 2016|accessdate=April 3, 2016|quote=The stadium will, until further notice, be known as the Coliseum, Oakland Coliseum or Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum.

The Athletics dedicated the Coliseum's playing surface "Rickey Henderson Field" in honor of [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|MLB Hall of Famer]] and former Athletic [[Rickey Henderson]] as part of Opening Day on April 3, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A’s to Dedicate Rickey Henderson Field|url=http://ballparkdigest.com/2017/02/08/as-to-dedicate-rickey-henderson-field/|work=Ballpark Digest|publisher=August Publications|date=February 8, 2017|accessdate=February 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eventual replacements===

The A's then-new owner [[Lewis Wolff]] made the A's first official proposal for a new ballpark in Oakland to the [[Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum Authority]] on August 12, 2005. The new stadium would have been located across 66th Avenue from the Coliseum in what is currently an industrial area north of the Coliseum. The park would have held 35,000 fans, making it the smallest park in the major leagues. Plans for the Oakland location fell through in early 2006 when several of the owners of the land proposed for the new ballpark decided not to sell.

Throughout 2006, the Athletics continued to search for a ballpark site within their designated territory of [[Alameda County]]. Late in 2006, rumors began to circulate regarding a {{convert|143|acre|sing=on}} parcel of land in [[Fremont, California|Fremont]] being the new site. These rumors were confirmed by the Fremont city council on November 8 of that year. Wolff met with the council that day to present his plan to move the A's to Fremont into a soon to be built ballpark named '''Cisco Field'''. Wolff and Cisco Systems conducted a press conference at the San Jose-based headquarters of Cisco Systems on November 14, 2006 to confirm the deal, and showcase some details of the future plan. However, on February 24, 2009, after delays and increased public opposition, the Athletics officially ended their search for a stadium site in Fremont.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A's Abandon Plans for Fremont Ballpark|first=David|last=Goll|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/sacramento/stories/2009/02/23/daily28.html|newspaper=Sacramento Business Journal|date=February 24, 2009|accessdate=November 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Athletics later took their Cisco Field plan to a site in downtown San Jose located near [[SAP Center]] (home of the NHL's [[San Jose Sharks]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bud Selig Shouldn't Bite on Oakland's Sketchy Pitch for A's|first=Mark|last=Purdy|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/mark-purdy/ci_16765087|newspaper=[[The Mercury News]]|location=San Jose|date=December 3, 2010|accessdate=July 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The San Jose plan was opposed by the [[San Francisco Giants]] whose territory San Jose is in and on October 5, 2015, the [[United States Supreme Court]] rejected San Jose's bid on the Athletics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=U.S. Supreme Court Rejects San Jose's Bid to Lure Oakland A's|first=Bob|last=Egelko|url=http://www.sfgate.com/athletics/article/U-S-Supreme-Court-rejects-San-Jose-s-bid-to-6550805.php|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=October 5, 2015|accessdate=October 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During that time, the City of Oakland continued to propose new ballpark ideas that ranged from a proposal to build on a waterfront site in the [[Jack London Square]] area called Victory Court to a three stadium proposal called ''Coliseum City'' on the Coliseum site. Both plans went nowhere. 

The Athletics signed a 10-year lease to stay in Oakland and at the Coliseum on July 22, 2014. The deal required that the team look into a new stadium, but only in the city limits, which made it more difficult for the Raiders to tear the Coliseum down for a football-only facility. The A's began talks with an architect on August 6, 2014, to build a baseball-only stadium at the Coliseum site, according to Wolff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A's Approach Architect About Building New Ballpark in Oakland|first=Carolyn|last=Jones|url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/A-s-approach-architect-about-building-a-new-5672384.php|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=August 6, 2014|accessdate=August 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Going into 2016, [[John J. Fisher]] took majority control of the team and made [[Dave Kaval]] team president and the person in charge of the stadium hunt. On September 12, 2017, it was announced that a site near [[Laney College]] and the Eastlake neighborhood had been chosen for the new ballpark (tentatively called [[Oakland Ballpark]]) with the A’s proposing to construct a 35,000 seat stadium on the site of the college's administrative buildings which the A's would relocate to a spot of the college's choosing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A’s Want to Build New Ballpark Next to Laney College in Oakland|first1=Phil|last1=Matier|first2=Andy|last2=Ross|url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/A-s-want-to-build-new-ballpark-next-to-Laney-12193239.php|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=September 13, 2017|accessdate=September 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Laney College Board of Trustees abruptly ended talks with the Athletics in December, 2017. The surprised A's were forced to look at alternatives for a new stadium location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Laney College Board Halts ballpark Plans, Leaving Oakland A’s Shocked|first=Kimberly|last=Veklerov|url=https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/College-board-orders-chancellor-to-halt-Laney-12409978.php|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=December 6, 2017|accessdate=September 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On November 28, 2018, The Athletics announced that the team had chosen to build it's 34,000 seat new ballpark at the Howard Terminal site at the [[Port of Oakland]]. The team also announced it's intent to purchase the coliseum site and make the site into a tech and housing hub, preserving [[Oracle Arena]] and reducing the Coliseum to a low-rise sports park as San Francisco did with [[Kezar Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/11/28/report-as-settle-on-a-ballpark-site-and-a-futuristic-stadium/|title=A’s settle on a ballpark site and a futuristic stadium|date=2018-11-28|work=The Mercury News|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Raiders====

Under any such replacement proposals, the [[Oakland Raiders]] would have presumably continued to play football in the Coliseum, although there were proposals for the Raiders to play at [[Levi's Stadium]], the home of the [[San Francisco 49ers]] in [[Santa Clara, California|Santa Clara]] as well as rumors regarding the Raiders' possible return to [[History of the Los Angeles Raiders|Los Angeles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NFL: 49ers &amp; Raiders Should Share Stadium|url=http://www.fannation.com/truth_and_rumors/view/87812|work=FanNation|date=January 25, 2009|accessdate=November 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=49ers and Raiders to Share Stadium?|first=Samuel|last=Lam|url=http://mvn.com/miningthegoldrush/2009/01/49ers-and-raiders-to-share-stadium.html|work=Most Valuable Network|date=January 11, 2009|accessdate=November 15, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090119061644/http://mvn.com/miningthegoldrush/2009/01/49ers-and-raiders-to-share-stadium.html|archivedate=January 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Los Angeles stadium planner: Talks held with five NFL teams|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2011/football/nfl/06/10/los-angeles-stadium.ap/index.html?sct=hp_t2_a3&amp;eref=sihp|work=[[Sports Illustrated]]|date=June 10, 2011|accessdate=September 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Raiders proposed a 50,000-seat stadium in the same spot of the Coliseum in 2013. It would have cost $800 million, with $300 million coming from the Raiders, $200 million coming from the NFL's stadium loan program, and the final $300 million coming from the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Oakland Raiders Want New $800M Stadium When Lease Expires After 2013 Season|first=David|last=Steele|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/nfl/index.ssf/2013/07/oakland_raiders_want_new_800m.html|newspaper=[[The Oregonian]]|location=Portland, OR|date=July 16, 2013|accessdate=July 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

After the failure of the stadium plan, Raiders owner [[Mark Davis (American football)|Mark Davis]] met with officials with the city of [[San Antonio]] on July 29, 2014, to discuss moving the Raiders to the city in time for the 2015 season; they would have temporarily played home games at the [[Alamodome]] until a new permanent stadium was built.

On September 3, 2014, the city of Oakland claimed it had reached a tentative deal to build a new football stadium in Oakland, which would have resulted in the Coliseum being demolished. The claim was met with silence from the Raiders, who continued to explore San Antonio, and opposition from Alameda County.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New Stadium Deal for Raiders Gives Team Land, Pays Off Debt|first1=Phil|last1=Matier|first2=Andy|last2=Ross|url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/matier-ross/article/New-stadium-deal-for-Raiders-give-s-team-land-5729877.php|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=September 3, 2014|accessdate=September 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 19, 2015, the Raiders and the [[San Diego Chargers]] announced plans for a privately financed $1.7 billion [[Carson Stadium|stadium]] that the two teams would have built in [[Carson, California|Carson]] upon being approved to move to the Los Angeles market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Chargers, Raiders Reveal L.A.

In January 2016, Mark Davis met with [[Las Vegas Sands]] owner [[Sheldon Adelson]] about building [[Las Vegas Stadium|a domed stadium]] on the [[University of Nevada, Las Vegas|UNLV]] campus for the Raiders and the [[UNLV Rebels football|UNLV Rebels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Las Vegas Sands Wants Stadium for UNLV, Possibly Raiders|url=https://www.si.com/college-football/2016/01/28/ap-fbo-las-vegas-sands-stadium|work=[[Sports Illustrated]]|date=January 29, 2016|accessdate=January 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium location was later moved to a site across [[Interstate 15 in Nevada|Interstate 15]] from [[Mandalay Bay]]. After the approval of $750 million from the state of [[Nevada]] and backing from [[Bank of America]] after Adelson pulled out of the project, the Raiders submitted papers for relocation to Las Vegas in January 2017, and on March 27, 2017, the Raiders' relocation to Las Vegas was approved. The team plans to continue to play at the Coliseum through the [[2019 NFL season]] and relocate to Las Vegas in 2020.

==Notable events==

===1960s===

====Raiders and A's move in====
The Raiders played their first game at the stadium on September 18, [[List of American Football League seasons#1966|1966]]. In 1968, the [[History of the Oakland Athletics#Kansas City|Kansas City Athletics]] moved to Oakland and began play at the stadium. The Athletics' first game was played on April 17, [[1968 Oakland Athletics season|1968]]. The stadium complex cost $25.5 million to build and rests on {{convert|120|acre|ha|abbr=on}} of land. On April 17, 1968, [[Boog Powell]] hit the first major league home run in the history of the Coliseum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://research.sabr.org/journals/home-run-baptism-of-new-parks|title=Home Run Baptism of New Parks|publisher=sabr.org|accessdate=December 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 8 of that year, [[Catfish Hunter]] pitched the ninth [[perfect game]] in Major League history at the Coliseum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=May 8, 1968 Twins-Athletics box score|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/OAK/OAK196805080.shtml|publisher=Baseball-Reference|accessdate=December 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Coliseum hosted the 1967 and 1969 AFL championship games. Additionally, the venue had hosted the second match of the [[NPSL Final 1967]].

===1970s===
[[Image:Black Hole at Falcons at Raiders 11-2-08.JPG|thumb|275px|left|The Black Hole (sections 104, 105, 106, and 107) during a Raiders home game against the [[2008 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]] on November 2, 2008]]

From 1970 to 1972 the stadium hosted 3 [[college football]] benefit games featuring Bay Area schools versus [[historically black colleges]].

The Coliseum hosted the 1971 [[East–West Shrine Game]] on January 2, 1971.

In [[1972 World Series|1972]], the [[1972 Oakland Athletics season|Athletics]] won their first of 3 straight [[World Series]] championships and their first since their years in Philadelphia.

The awkwardness of the baseball-football conversion, as well as the low seating capacity (around 54,000 for football) and that the prime seating on the east side consisted of temporary bleachers led the Raiders to explore other stadium options. One such option was [[Memorial Stadium (University of California at Berkeley)|Memorial Stadium]] on the UC Berkeley campus. Several preseason games were played there in the early 1970s along with one regular season game in 1973 (a 12-7 victory over the [[1973 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]] during September while the A's regular season was going on). However, in response to traffic and parking issues associated with these games (while Cal games drew a large number of students who live on or near campus and walk to the games, Raiders games attracted fans from a larger geographic area who were used to tailgating at the Coliseum and were more likely to drive to games), the City of Berkeley passed a Professional Sports Events License Tax in which the city collected 10% of all gate receipts, making the staging of professional games inside the city cost-prohibitive. The Raiders were granted an injunction from the city collecting the tax, arguing that the tax was a regulatory measure rather than a revenue measure, and was therefore an improper regulation on land held in trust by the Regents of the University of California. However, the grant of the injunction was reversed by the California Court of Appeals, who found it to be a revenue measure, despite the fact that the city had made the measure immediately effective "due to danger to the public peace, health, and safety of the City of Berkeley as a result of the holding of professional sports events there".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Oakland Raiders vs. City of Berkeley, 65 Cal. App. 3d 623|url=http://law.justia.com/cases/california/calapp3d/65/623.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium was not well maintained for most of the late 1970s. Its condition was most noticeable during baseball season, when crowds for A's games twice numbered fewer than 1,000. On April 17, 1979, only 653 fans attended the game versus the [[1979 Seattle Mariners season|Seattle Mariners]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/OAK/OAK197904170.shtml|title=April 17, 1979 Seattle Mariners at Oakland Athletics|publisher=Baseball-Reference|date=April 17, 1979|accessdate=July 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, it was popularly known as the "Oakland Mausoleum".

===1980s===
[[File:1985 Mother's Cookies - Oakland Coliseum.JPG|thumb|275px|An A's game at the Coliseum in 1985]]

In [[1980 NFL season|1980]], the [[1980 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]] won [[Super Bowl XV]]. [[1982 NFL season|Two years later]], the Raiders moved to Los Angeles, leaving the A's as the only remaining tenants of Oakland Coliseum. Only days later, Finley agreed to sell the A's to [[Marvin Davis]], who planned to move the A's to Denver. However, city and county officials were not about to lose Oakland's status as a major-league city in its own right, and refused to let the A's out of their lease. Finley sold the team instead to the owners of San Francisco-based [[Levi Strauss &amp; Co.]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}  After the [[1986 Major League Baseball season]], the original scoreboards were replaced.  A new American Sign and Indicator scoreboard and message center was installed behind the left-field bleachers, while the original right-field scoreboard was replaced with a manually operated out-of-town scoreboard.  Between the centerfield flagpoles, a new [[Diamond Vision]] videoscreen was installed.

The [[1987 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1987]] [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game]] was held at the stadium. From [[1988 World Series|1988]] to [[1990 World Series|1990]], the venue saw 3 more World Series. In [[1989 in baseball|1989]], the [[1989 Oakland Athletics season|Athletics]] won their 4th Series since moving to Oakland, sweeping the [[1989 San Francisco Giants season|San Francisco Giants]] in the [[Loma Prieta earthquake|earthquake]]-interrupted [[1989 World Series|"Battle of the Bay" Series]].

===1990s===
In the 1990s, several major concerts were held, but these were not "Days on the Green", by definition, because they occurred at night.

In July 1995, the Raiders agreed to return to Oakland provided that Oakland Coliseum underwent renovations. In November 1995, those renovations commenced and continued through the next summer until the beginning of the [[1996 NFL season|1996]] football season (more info below). The new layout also had the somewhat peculiar effect of creating an inward jog in the outfield fence, in left-center and right-center. There are now three distance markers instead of one, at various points of the power alleys, as indicated in the dimensions grid.  The Raiders' return also heralded the creation of the "Black Hole", a highly recognizable group of fans who occupy one end zone seating during football games.

Along with the since-demolished [[Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium]], the stadium features the unusual configuration of laying the football field on a line from first to third base rather than laying it from home plate to center field, or parallel to one of the foul lines, as with most multipurpose facilities. Thus, a seat behind home plate for baseball is behind the 50-yard line for football. With the [[Miami Marlins]] opening their own [[Marlins Park|ballpark]] in 2012, the stadium became the last remaining venue in the United States that hosts both a Major League Baseball and a National Football League team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Report: New tSadium to Open April 4|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=6725189|work=[[ESPN]]|date=June 30, 2011|accessdate=May 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000s===
On April 2, 2006, the broadcast booth was renamed in honor of the late [[Bill King]], a legendary Bay Area sportscaster who was the play-by-play voice of the A's, Raiders and [[Golden State Warriors|Warriors]] for 44 years.

[[San Jose Earthquakes]] of [[Major League Soccer]], announced in November 2007 that they would be playing their "big draw" games, such as those featuring [[David Beckham]] and the [[Los Angeles Galaxy]], at the stadium instead of their then-home [[Buck Shaw Stadium]] (capacity roughly over 10,000) in [[Santa Clara, California|Santa Clara]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=FAQ|url=http://web.mlsnet.com/t110/faq.jsp#gen01|publisher=San Jose Earthquakes|accessdate=November 30, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009200309/http://web.mlsnet.com/t110/faq.jsp#gen01|archivedate=October 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then the Quakes moved to their new home of [[Avaya Stadium]] and play their bigger games in nearby [[Stanford Stadium]].

Midway through the decade, the stadium established a "no re-entry" policy. Each ticket can only be used once, after which a second ticket must be purchased in order to re-enter the Coliseum.

===2010s===
On May 9, 2010, almost 42 years to the day of Catfish Hunter's perfect game, [[Dallas Braden]] pitched the 19th perfect game in Major League history at the Coliseum. A commemorative graphic was placed on the baseball outfield wall next to Rickey Henderson's retired number on May 17, their next home game.

As part of a new 10-year lease signed by the Athletics with the Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum Authority in 2014, the Oakland Coliseum had a new $10 million scoreboard system (two large outfield scoreboards, 36 feet tall and 145 feet wide, and two ribbon scoreboards) installed for the start of the 2015 MLB season. Also part of the new lease, the Coliseum Authority agreed to pay $1 million a year, with 5% annual increases, into a fund to maintain the stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Oakland A’s Showcase New Scoreboards at O.co Coliseum|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/athletics/ci_27856599/photos-oakland-showcase-new-scoreboards-at-o-co|newspaper=[[The Mercury News]]|location=San Jose|date=April 6, 2015|accessdate=April 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the 2017 Major League Baseball season, the tarp covering a large amount of the baseball configuration has been removed, increasing the capacity to over 47,000 for the first time since 1995. The tarp remains on the football-only Mt. Davis.

===Concerts===
Commencing in 1973, the stadium hosted an annual [[Day on the Green]] concert series, presented by [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]] and his company [[Bill Graham Presents]], which continued on into the early 1990s.

[[Marvin Gaye]] made his official return to live performing and touring at the Coliseum on January 4, 1974 and the Coliseum was the basis for his 1 million-selling live album, ''[[Marvin Gaye Live!]]'' At the time, music industry executives cited the tour as a "heralded event" as Gaye made a comeback to live touring nearly 4 years after the death of his late singing partner [[Tammi Terrell]].

[[Led Zeppelin]] played what turned out to be their final North American concerts with twin shows during their [[Led Zeppelin North American Tour 1977|1977 North American Tour]]. This was due to the brutal assault on [[Peter Grant (music manager)|Peter Grant]]'s 11-year-old son Warren by a Bill Graham roadie, and the sudden death of [[Robert Plant]]'s young son Karac in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Trouble at Coliseum Concert|first=Jeff|last=Harrison|newspaper=Oakland Tribune|location=Oakland|date=July 24, 1977|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Parliament-Funkadelic]] recorded half the album ''[[Live: P-Funk Earth Tour]]'' at the Oakland Coliseum on January 21, 1977. The album was released in April of that year.

The stadium played host to [[Amnesty International]]'s [[Human Rights Now!]] Benefit Concert on September 23, 1988. The show was headlined by [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] and [[Peter Gabriel]] and also featured [[Bruce Springsteen]] &amp; The [[E Street Band]], [[Tracy Chapman]], [[Youssou N'Dour]], [[Roy Orbison]] and [[Joan Baez]].

[[Metallica]] and [[Guns N' Roses]] brought the [[Guns N' Roses/Metallica Stadium Tour]] to the Coliseum on September 24, 1992, with [[Body Count (band)|Body Count]] as their opening act.

[[U2]] played two nights in June 1997 at the Oakland Coliseum as part of their ''[[PopMart]]'' tour. They were supported by [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]], one of the first shows of their ''Be Here Now'' tour.

The stadium played host to The [[Gigantour]] on September 8, 2006, featuring performances by [[Megadeth]], [[Lamb of God (band)|Lamb of God]], [[Opeth]], [[Arch Enemy]], [[Overkill (band)|Overkill]], [[Into Eternity (band)|Into Eternity]], [[Sanctity (band)|Sanctity]] and [[The SmashUp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Gigantour 2008 Official site|url=http://www.gigantour.com/home.php|publisher=Gigantour|accessdate=February 5, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130142830/http://www.gigantour.com/home.php|archivedate=January 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[U2]] performed during their [[U2 360° Tour|360° Tour]] on June 7, 2011, with [[Lenny Kravitz]] and [[Moonalice]] as their opening acts. The show was originally scheduled to take place on June 16, 2010, but was postponed, due to [[Bono]]'s emergency back surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=U2 Review: Soulful, Impressive and Worth the Wait|first=Aidin|last=Vaziri|url=http://www.sfgate.com/music/article/U2-review-Soulful-impressive-and-worth-the-wait-2368175.php|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=June 8, 2011|accessdate=June 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 5, 2017, [[Green Day]] played a homecoming concert at the Coliseum. The show was part of the band's summer tour in support of their third number 1 album, [[Revolution Radio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Review: Green Day Welcomes Local Fans to Pop-Punk 'Paradise'|first=Jim|last=Harrington|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/08/06/review-green-day-welcomes-local-fans-to-pop-punk-paradise/|newspaper=[[The Mercury News]]|location=San Jose|date=August 6, 2017|accessdate=August 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium holds the distinction of hosting the most concerts by [[Grateful Dead|The Grateful Dead]] with 66 shows between 1979-1995.

===In popular culture===
[[Richard Marx]] shot the video for "[[Take This Heart]]" on the baseball field of the Coliseum.

The stadium was the location for the 1994 [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]] movie ''[[Angels in the Outfield (1994 film)|Angels in the Outfield]]''. Although [[Angel Stadium of Anaheim]] (known as Anaheim Stadium at the time) was where the Angels actually played, it was damaged in the [[1994 Northridge earthquake|1994 Southern California earthquake]]. Anaheim Stadium was used for views from the outside and aerial views, while the Coliseum was used for interior shots.

The Coliseum was also used for scenes in the 2011 film ''[[Moneyball (film)|Moneyball]]''.

===Other events===
The stadium has hosted an [[AMA Supercross Championship]] round since 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amasupercross.com/MediaGuide/SXMediaGuide_15_lores.pdf 2015 AMA Supercross media guide]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
{{Criticism section|date=July 2013}}

===Baseball===
In recent years, the Coliseum has been criticized as being one of the "worst stadiums in baseball".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The 5 Worst Stadiums in All of Major League Baseball|first=Orly|last=Rios, Jr.|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/589884-the-five-worst-stadiums-in-all-of-major-league-baseball|work=[[Bleacher Report]]|date=January 30, 2011|accessdate=October 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Problems cited include the large amount of foul territory and the addition of [[Mount Davis (Oakland)|Mount Davis]]. The former allows for more foul-outs while the latter has been criticized for "ruining" the ambience of the original configuration.

===Mount Davis===
{{main|Mount Davis (Oakland)}}
[[Image:King Booth.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Bill King]] Broadcast Booth, with a [[tarpaulin]] covering the third deck]]
One feature of the 1996 expansion was the addition of over 10,000 seats in the upper deck that now spans the outfield in the baseball configuration, enclosing the stadium. Due to the stands' height and the loss of the Oakland hills view, A's fans have derisively nicknamed the structure "Mount Davis", after late Raiders owner [[Al Davis]]. It has been criticized as an area which has made the Oakland Coliseum look ever more like a football stadium, and not at all one for baseball.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Inside the Press Box: Oakland: Less Seats, More Filling|url=http://www.loveofthegameproductions.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=1125|publisher=Love of the Game Productions|accessdate=September 15, 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007140129/http://www.loveofthegameproductions.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=1125|archivedate=October 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[2006 in baseball|2006]], the Athletics covered the entire third deck with a [[tarpaulin]] (tarp), reducing capacity to 34,077—the smallest capacity in MLB at the time. Even if a game was otherwise sold out, the A's would not sell any seats in the area. It would remain covered except if they made the [[World Series]]. The A's said that closing off the upper deck would create a "more intimate environment" for baseball. This drew criticism from fans, the [[Oakland City Council]], and sports marketing analysts baffled at owner [[Lew Wolff]]'s decision, with some stating that this was cover for a possible move to [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] (see [[Cisco Field]]). There were 20,878 seats covered up by the tarp which would otherwise have been usable for baseball.&lt;ref name="tarpcap"/&gt; In 2017, new team President [[Dave Kaval]] decided to remove several sections covered by tarps. This increased capacity by 12,103 to 47,170.&lt;ref name=tarpsoff/&gt;

In February 2013, the Oakland Raiders announced that they would cover 11,000 seats in the Mount Davis section with a tarp to avoid [[Blackout (broadcasting)|blackouts]].  This reduces capacity to 53,250, by far the smallest in the NFL (league rules require a minimum capacity of 50,000, and no other stadium, barring the temporary-use [[StubHub Center]], seats fewer than 61,000). Under NFL rules, the tarps have to stay in place all season long, no matter if they make the playoffs or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Raiders Will Tarp Top of Mount Davis|first=Vic|last=Tafur|url=http://www.sfgate.com/raiders/article/Raiders-will-tarp-top-of-Mount-Davis-4258267.php|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=February 6, 2013|accessdate=July 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sewage===
On June 16, 2013 following the game against the [[Seattle Mariners]], the Coliseum experienced a severe [[sewage treatment|sewage]] backup.  This led to pipes leaking out puddles of sewage into the showers, offices, visitor training room and storage areas on the clubhouse level of the stadium, all of which are 3 feet (1 m) below sea level.  After the game, the A's and Mariners were forced to share the Oakland Raiders locker room, located on the stadium's second floor.  According to Coliseum officials, the stadium's aging plumbing system was overtaxed after a six-game homestand that drew close to baseball capacity crowds totaling 171,756 fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A's, M's Forced Into Same Locker Room|url=http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/9393784/sewage-problem-puts-oakland-seattle-mariners-same-locker-room|work=[[ESPN]]|date=June 16, 2013|accessdate=June 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was not the first time sewage problems cropped up at the stadium.  For instance, on one occasion the Angels complained about [[E. coli]] in the visiting team's training room after a backup.  Backups occur even when no events are taking place there.&lt;ref name=ChronSewage&gt;{{cite news |title=Raw Sewage on Clubhouse Level Creates Chaos|first=Susan|last=Slusser|authorlink=Susan Slusser|url=http://blog.sfgate.com/athletics/2013/06/16/raw-sewage-on-clubhouse-level-creates-postgame-chaos|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=June 16, 2013|accessdate=June 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For instance, [[Lew Wolff|Wolff]] wanted to go to dinner on June 12, 2013 (while the A's were on the road) at one of the Coliseum's restaurants, only to find out that food service had been halted due to a sewage leak in the kitchen.&lt;ref name=TribSewage&gt;{{cite news |title=Oakland A's Owner Lew Wolff Says Coliseum Sewage Mess Not Unusual|first=Carl|last=Steward|url=http://www.insidebayarea.com/athletics/ci_23478623/oakland-owner-lew-wolff-says-coliseum-sewage-mess|newspaper=[[Oakland Tribune]]|date=June 17, 2013|accessdate=June 17, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130624030854/http://www.insidebayarea.com/athletics/ci_23478623/oakland-owner-lew-wolff-says-coliseum-sewage-mess|archivedate=June 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The''' Olympic symbols '''are icons, flags, and symbols used by the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) to elevate the [[Olympic Games]]. Some{{mdash}}such as the flame, fanfare, and theme{{mdash}}are more commonly used during Olympic competition, but others, such as the flags, can be seen throughout the years.The Olympic flag was created under the guidance of Baron Coubertin in 1913 and was released in 1914.But it was first hoisted in 1920 in Belgium at the Antwerp Olympic games in the main stadium.

==Motto==
The Olympic motto is the [[hendiatris]] ''Citius, Altius, Fortius'', which is [[Latin]] for "Faster, Higher, Stronger".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://registration.olympic.org/en/faq/detail/id/29 |title=What is the Olympic motto? |year=2013 |publisher=International Olympic Committee |accessdate=19 September 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150918085634/http://registration.olympic.org/en/faq/detail/id/29 |archivedate=18 September 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was proposed by [[Pierre de Coubertin]] upon the creation of the International Olympic Committee in 1894. Coubertin borrowed it from his friend [[Henri Didon]], a [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] priest who was an athletics enthusiast.&lt;ref name=motto&gt;{{cite web| title=Opening Ceremony| url=http://www.olympic.org/Documents/Reports/EN/en_report_268.pdf| publisher=International Olympic Committee| accessdate=23 August 2012| page=3| format=pdf| year=2002}}; "Sport athlétique", 14 mars 1891: "[...] dans une éloquente allocution il a souhaité que ce drapeau les conduise 'souvent à la victoire, à la lutte toujours'. Il a dit qu'il leur donnait pour devise ces trois mots qui sont le fondement et la raison d'être des sports athlétiques: citius, altius, fortius, ‘plus vite, plus haut, plus fort’.", cited in Hoffmane, Simone ''La carrière du père Didon, Dominicain. 1840 - 1900'', Doctoral thesis, Université de Paris IV&amp;nbsp;— Sorbonne, 1985, p. 926; cf. Michaela Lochmann, ''Les fondements pédagogiques de la devise olympique „citius, altius, fortius“''&lt;/ref&gt; Coubertin said "These three words represent a programme of moral beauty. The aesthetics of sport are intangible."&lt;ref name=motto /&gt; The motto was introduced in 1924 at the Olympic Games in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/past/index_uk.asp?OLGT=1&amp;OLGY=1924 Games of the VIII Olympiad - Paris 1924] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070303133133/http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/past/index_uk.asp?OLGT=1&amp;OLGY=1924 |date=3 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A more informal but well-known motto, also introduced by Coubertin, is "The most important thing is not to win but to take part!" Coubertin got this motto from a sermon by the Bishop of Pennsylvania during the 1908 London Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/Documents/Reference_documents_Factsheets/The_Olympic_Summer_Games.pdf |title=The Olympic Summer Games |publisher=International Olympic Committee |date=October 2013 |accessdate=29 December 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906110401/http://www.olympic.org/Documents/Reference_documents_Factsheets/The_Olympic_Summer_Games.pdf |archivedate=6 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|Olympic rings}}Rings==
[[File:Olympic rings without rims.svg|thumb|The five-ringed symbol of the Olympic Games]]

The rings are five interlocking rings, coloured blue, yellow, black, green, and red on a white field, known as the "Olympic rings". The symbol was originally designed in 1912 by de Coubertin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/story/olympics-symbols-and-traditions|title=Olympics: Symbols and Traditions|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-02-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He appears to have intended the rings to represent the five continents: [[Europe]], [[Asia]], [[Africa]], [[Oceania]], and [[Americas|America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=The Story of the Rings| url=http://library.la84.org/SportsLibrary/JOH/JOHv10n1/JOHv10n1m.pdf| work=Journal of Olympic History| date=2002 |volume=10| last=Lennartz| first=Karl| page=32| accessdate=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Coubertin, the colours of the rings together with the white of the background included the colours composing every competing nation's flag at the time. Upon its initial introduction, Coubertin stated the following in the August 1912 edition of ''Olympique'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=The Story of the Rings| url=http://library.la84.org/SportsLibrary/JOH/JOHv10n1/JOHv10n1m.pdf| work=Journal of Olympic History|date=2002 |volume=10| last=Lennartz| first=Karl| page=31| accessdate=7 January 2016| quote=De plus les six couleurs ainsi combinées reproduisent celles de toutes les nations sans exception. Le bleu et jaune de Suède, le bleu et blanc de Grèce, les tricolores français, anglais, américain, allemand, belge, italien, hongrois, le jaune et rouge d'Espagne voisinent avec les innovations brésilienne ou australienne, avec le vieux Japon et la jeune Chine. Voilà vraiment un emblème international.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- This is a translated quotation;  it is the translation appearing in the Journal of Olympic History (citation above).  Do not change it unless you find an actual error of translation.--&gt;
{{quote|... the six colours [including the flag's white background] combined in this way reproduce the colours of every country without exception. The blue and yellow of Sweden, the blue and white of Greece, the tricolour flags of France, England, the United States, Germany, Belgium, Italy and Hungary, and the yellow and red of Spain are included, as are the innovative flags of Brazil and Australia, and those of ancient Japan and modern China. This, truly, is an international emblem.}}

In his article published in the ''Olympic Revue'' the official magazine of the International Olympic Committee in November 1992, the American historian Robert Barney explains that the idea of the interlaced rings came to Pierre de Coubertin when he was in charge of the [[Union des Sociétés Françaises de Sports Athlétiques|USFSA]], an association founded by the union of two French sports associations and until 1925, responsible for representing the [[International Olympic Committee]] in France: The emblem of the union was two interlaced rings (like the [[vesica piscis]] typical interlaced marriage rings) and originally the idea of Swiss psychiatrist [[Carl Jung]]: for him, the ring symbolized continuity and the human being.&lt;ref name="AAFLA"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/OlympicInformationCenter/OlympicReview/1992/ore301/ORE301p.pdf |format=PDF |title=This Great Symbol |author=Robert Knight Barney |accessdate=29 December 2015 |work=Olympic Review| date=November 1992| number=301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1914 Congress was suspended due to the outbreak of [[World War I]], but the symbol and flag were later adopted. They would first officially debut at the [[Games of the VII Olympiad]] in [[Antwerp (city)|Antwerp, Belgium]], in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Encyclopedia of the Modern Olympic Movement| editor1-first=John E.| editor1-last=Findling| editor2-first=Kimberly D.| editor2-last=Pele| url=https://www.amazon.com/Encyclopedia-Modern-Olympic-Movement-Findling/dp/0313322783#reader_0313322783| publisher=Greenwood Press| date=30 March 2004| isbn=978-0313322785| pages=65, 75| subscription=yes| accessdate=29 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The symbol's popularity and widespread use began during the lead-up to the [[1936 Summer Olympics]] in Berlin. [[Carl Diem]], president of the Organizing Committee of the [[1936 Summer Olympics]], wanted to hold a torchbearers' ceremony in the stadium at [[Delphi]], site of the famous oracle, where the [[Pythian Games]] were also held. For this reason he ordered construction of a milestone with the Olympic rings carved in the sides, and that a torchbearer should carry the flame along with an escort of three others from there to Berlin. The ceremony was celebrated but the stone was never removed. Later, two American authors, [[Lynn Poole|Lynn and Gray Poole]], when visiting Delphi in the late 1950s, saw the stone and reported in their ''History of the Ancient Games''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/history-of-ancient-olympic-games/oclc/541303|title=History of ancient Olympic games,|last=Poole|first=Lynn|last2=Poole|first2=Gray Johnson|date=1963-01-01|publisher=I. Obolensky|location=New York|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the Olympic rings design came from ancient Greece. This has become known as "Carl Diem's Stone".&lt;ref name="aldaver"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aldaver.com |title=Logos &amp; Mascots |date=27 February 2007 |accessdate=18 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This created a myth that the symbol had an ancient Greek origin.

The current view of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) is that the symbol "reinforces the idea" that the Olympic Movement is international and welcomes all countries of the world to join.&lt;ref name="IOC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_672.pdf |format=PDF|title=The Olympic symbols |accessdate=18 March 2007 |year=2002 |publisher=[[IOC]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070316083724/http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_672.pdf |archivedate=16 March 2007}} [Broken link]&lt;/ref&gt; As can be read in the [[Olympic Charter]], the Olympic symbol represents the union of the "[[five continents]]" of the world and the meeting of athletes from throughout the world at the Olympic Games. However, no continent is represented by any specific ring. Prior to 1951, the official handbook stated that each colour corresponded to a particular continent: blue for Europe, yellow for Asia, black for Africa, green for Australia and Oceania, and red for the [[Americas]]; this was removed because there was no evidence that Coubertin had intended it (the quotation above was probably an afterthought).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=January 1951 |title=Decision adopted by the Executive Committee |journal=Bulletin du Comité International Olympique (Olympic Review)|publisher=IOC |location=Lausanne |issue=25 |page=32 |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/OlympicInformationCenter/OlympicReview/1951/BDCE25/BDCE25s.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the logo of the [[Association of National Olympic Committees]] places the logo of each of its five continental associations inside the ring of the corresponding colour.

==Different Types Of Flags==

The Olympic flag was created by Pierre de Coubertin in 1925.

===Specific flags used===
There are specific Olympic flags that are displayed by cities that will be hosting the next Olympic games. During each Olympic closing ceremony in what is traditionally known as the Antwerp Ceremony,&lt;ref name="OCprotocol2"&gt;{{cite web| title=Olympic Charter| publisher=The International Olympic Committee| date=2 August 2015| url=http://www.olympic.org/Documents/olympic_charter_en.pdf| accessdate=29 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the flag is passed from the mayor of one host city to the next host, where it will then be taken to the new host and displayed at city hall. These flags should not be confused with the larger Olympic flags designed and created specifically for each games, which are flown over the host stadium and then retired. Because there is no specific flag for this purpose, the flags flown over the stadiums generally have subtle differences, including minor color variations, and, more noticeably, the presence (or lack) of white outlines around each ring.

====Antwerp flag====
The first Olympic flag was presented to the Jr National Olympics at the [[1920 Summer Olympics]] by the city of [[Antwerp, Belgium]]. At the end of the Games, the flag could not be found and a new Olympic flag had to be made for the [[1924 Summer Olympics]] in Paris. Despite it being a replacement, the IOC officially still calls this the "Antwerp Flag" instead of the "Paris Flag".&lt;ref name="Vancouver2010Symbols"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.vancouver2010.com/olympic-news/n/news/feature-stories/the-olympic-flags-and-emblem_38344IZ.html| title=Vancouver 2010: The Olympic Flags the Closing Ceremony of the '''Los Angeles 1984 Olympic Games''', the flag was passed on to the next Olympic Games city, Seoul, and then retired. [emphasis added]| accessdate=1 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was passed on to the next organizing city of the [[Summer Olympics]] or [[Winter Olympics]] until the [[1952 Winter Olympics]] in [[Oslo, Norway]], when a separate Olympic flag was created to be used only at the Winter Olympics ''(see below)''. The 1924 flag then continued to be used at the Summer Olympics until the Games of [[1988 Summer Olympics|Seoul 1988]] when it was retired.

In 1997, at a banquet hosted by the US Olympic Committee, a reporter was interviewing [[Hal Haig Prieste]] who had won a bronze medal in platform diving as a member of the 1920 US Olympic team. The reporter mentioned that the IOC had not been able to find out what had happened to the original Olympic flag. "I can help you with that," Prieste said, "It's in my suitcase." At the end of the Antwerp Olympics, spurred on by teammate [[Duke Kahanamoku]], he climbed a flagpole and stole the Olympic flag. For 77 years the flag was stored away in the bottom of his suitcase. The flag was returned to the IOC by Prieste, by then 103 years old, in a special ceremony held at the 2000 Games in Sydney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0DE3DE1738F931A2575AC0A9669C8B63&amp;&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=olympic%20flag%20antwerp&amp;st=cse| title=Missing Flag Returns to Glory, Courtesy of a Prankster| work=[[The New York Times]]| first=Richard| last=Sandomir| date=12 September 2000| accessdate=20 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original Antwerp Flag is now on display at the Olympic Museum in [[Lausanne]], [[Switzerland]], with a plaque thanking him for donating it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Después de ochenta años le remordió la conciencia| url=http://www.larepublica.com.uy/deportes/21819-despues-de-ochenta-anos-le-remordio-la-conciencia|trans-title=After Eighty Years, Conscience Kicked Him| publisher=La Red21 Radio| location=Montevideo| date=12 September 2000| language=Spanish| accessdate=29 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Oslo flag====
The Oslo flag was presented to the IOC by the mayor of [[Oslo, Norway]], during the [[1952 Winter Olympics]]. Since then, it has been passed to the next organizing city for the [[Winter Olympics]]. Currently, the actual Oslo flag is kept preserved in a special box, and a replica has been used during recent closing ceremonies instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.vancouver2010.com/olympic-news/n/news/feature-stories/the-olympic-flags-and-emblem_38344IZ.html| title=Vancouver 2010: The Olympic Flags and Emblem| quote=Because it is so precious, and must be preserved for years to come, the Oslo flag is not used during the actual Closing Ceremony.

====Singapore flag====
For the inaugural [[Youth Olympic Games]], an Olympic flag was created for the junior version of the Games. The flag is similar to the Olympic flag, but has the host city and year on it and was first presented to Singapore by [[IOC]] President [[Jacques Rogge]].&lt;ref name="singapore"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://gamesbids.com/eng/youth-olympic-bids/other-youth-olympic-news/singapore-2010-presented-with-special-olympic-flag/| title=Singapore 2010 Presented With Special Olympic Flag| date=13 August 2010| publisher=Gamebids.com| accessdate=29 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="singapore2"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1075051/1/.html| archive-url=https://archive.is/20120728113202/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1075051/1/.html| dead-url=yes| archive-date=28 July 2012| title=S'pore presented with special Olympic flag| date=13 August 2010| publisher=[[Channel NewsAsia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the closing ceremony on 26 August 2010, Singapore officials presented it to the next organizing committee, [[Nanjing 2014]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://english.sina.com/sports/2010/0826/336406.html| title=Olympic flag handed to mayor of Nanjing| date=27 August 2010| publisher=[[Sina Corp]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Innsbruck flag====
For the inaugural winter [[Youth Olympic Games]], an Olympic flag was presented to the IOC at the [[2012 Winter Youth Olympics]] by the city of [[Innsbruck]], [[Austria]], and has since then been passed on to the next organizing city of the Winter Youth Olympics.

==Flame and torch relay==
{{Main|Olympic flame}}
The modern tradition of moving the Olympic flame via a relay system from Greece to the Olympic venue began with the Berlin Games in 1936. Months before the Games are held, the Olympic flame is lit on a torch, with the rays of the Sun concentrated by a [[parabolic reflector]], at the site of the Ancient Olympics in [[Olympia, Greece]]. The torch is then taken out of Greece, most often to be taken around the country or continent where the Games are held. The Olympic torch is carried by athletes, leaders, celebrities, and ordinary people alike, and at times in unusual conditions, such as being electronically transmitted via satellite for [[Montreal 1976]], submerged underwater without being extinguished for [[Sydney 2000]], or in space and at the [[North Pole]] for [[Sochi 2014]]. On the final day of the torch relay, the day of the [[Olympic Games ceremony#Opening|Opening Ceremony]], the Flame reaches the main stadium and is used to light a cauldron situated in a prominent part of the venue to signify the beginning of the Games.

==Medals and diplomas==
The Olympic medals awarded to winners are another symbol associated with the Olympic games. The medals are made of [[gold-plated]] silver &amp;ndash; for the [[gold medal]]s &amp;ndash; silver, or [[bronze]], and are awarded to the top three finishers in a particular event. Each medal for an Olympiad has a common design, decided upon by the organizers for the particular games. From 1928 until 2000, the obverse side of the medals contained an image of [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]], the traditional goddess of victory, holding a palm in her left hand and a winner's crown in her right. This design was created by Giuseppe Cassioli. For each Olympic games, the reverse side as well as the labels for each Olympiad changed, reflecting the host of the games.

In 2004, the obverse side of the medals changed to make more explicit reference to the Greek character of the games. In this design, the goddess Nike flies into the Panathenic stadium, reflecting the renewal of the games. The design was by Greek jewelry designer [[Elena Votsi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Juergen Wagner |url=http://olympic-museum.de/w_medals/wmed2004.htm |title=Olympic Games Winner Medal 2004 |publisher=Olympic-museum.de |date=2 July 2003 |accessdate=31 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110111105048/http://olympic-museum.de/w_medals/wmed2004.htm |archivedate=11 January 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Olympic diploma]]s are given to competitors placing fourth, fifth, and sixth since 1949, and to competitors placing seventh and eighth since 1981.

==Anthems==
{{Main|Olympic Hymn}}
The "[[Olympic Hymn]]", officially known as the "Olympic Anthem", is played when the Olympic flag is raised. It was composed by [[Spyridon Samaras]] with words from a poem of the [[Greeks|Greek]] poet and writer [[Kostis Palamas]]. Both the poet and the composer were the choice of [[Demetrius Vikelas]], a Greek [[Pro-European]] and the first President of the IOC. The anthem was performed for the first time for the ceremony of opening of the [[1896 Summer Olympics|1896 Athens Olympic Games]] but wasn't declared the official hymn by the IOC until 1958. In the following years, every hosting nation commissioned the composition of a specific Olympic hymn for their own edition of the Games until the [[1960 Winter Olympics]] in Squaw Valley.

Other notable Olympic anthems and fanfares include:
[[File:AarreMerikanto1952.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The composer of the 1952 Olympic Fanfare, [[Aarre Merikanto]], at [[Helsinki Olympic Stadium]] during the games.]]
*"[[Olympische Hymne]]": A composition for orchestra and mixed chorus composed by [[Richard Strauss]] for the [[1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Berlin Summer Olympics]].
*The "Olympic Fanfare" for the [[1952 Summer Olympics|1952 Helsinki Summer Olympics]] was originally composed by [[Aarre Merikanto]] for the [[1940 Summer Olympics]], which were cancelled. Merikanto's Fanfare won the fanfare contest organized in [[Finland]] in 1939, but the score was lost for over a decade; when rediscovered in 1951, it was decided to use it in 1952. It was recorded in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Heikinheimo| first=Seppo| title=Aarre Merikanto: Säveltäjänkohtalo itsenäisessä Suomessa| pages=465, 467, 473, 479| language=Finnish| location=Helsinki| publisher=WSOY| year=1985| isbn=978-9510133194|trans-title=Aarre Merikanto: The fate of the composer in independent Finland}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*"[[Bugler's Dream]]": Written in 1958 by [[Leo Arnaud]] as part of his ''Charge Suite'', the theme is often thought of by Americans as the Olympic Theme" due to its usage in television coverage by [[Olympics on ABC|ABC]] and [[Olympics on NBC|NBC]], starting with the 1964 Olympics.

==Kotinos==
{{main|Olive wreath}}
The ''kotinos'' ({{lang-el|κότινος}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=κότινος|trans-title=Olive Branch| work=A Greek–English Lexicon| language=Greek| url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dko%2Ftinos| first1=Henry George| last1=Liddell| first2=Robert| last2=Scott| publisher=Clarendon Press| year=1940}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[olive]] branch, originally of wild olive-tree, intertwined to form a circle or a horse-shoe, introduced by [[Heracles]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], Description of Greece, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+5.7.7&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0160 5.7.7]&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[ancient Olympic Games]] there were no [[gold medal#Olympic Games|gold]], silver, or bronze medals. There was only one winner per event, crowned with an olive wreath made of wild olive leaves from a sacred tree near the temple of Zeus at Olympia. [[Aristophanes]] in [[Plutus (play)|Plutus]] makes a sensible remark as to why victorious athletes are crowned with a wreath made of wild olive instead of gold.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristophanes]], [[Plutus (play)|Plutus]], 585.&lt;/ref&gt; The victorious athletes were honoured, feted, and praised. Their deeds were heralded and chronicled so that future generations could appreciate their accomplishments.

[[Herodotus]] describes the following story which is relevant to the olive wreath. [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]] was interrogating some [[Regions of ancient Greece#Arcadia|Arcadian]]s after the [[Battle of Thermopylae]]. He inquired why there were so few Greek men defending Thermopylae. The answer was "All other men are participating in the Olympic Games". And when asked "What is the prize for the winner?", "An olive-wreath" came the answer. Then [[Tigranes]], one of his generals uttered a most noble saying: "Good heavens! [[Mardonius (general)|Mardonius]], what kind of men are these against whom you have brought us to fight? Men who do not compete for possessions, but for honour."&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, The Histories, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+8.26&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126 Hdt. 8.26]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in later times, this was not their only reward; the athlete was rewarded with a generous sum of money by his country. The kotinos tradition was renewed specifically for the Athens 2004 Games, although in this case it was bestowed together with the gold medal. Apart from its use in the awards ceremonies, the kotinos was chosen as the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] emblem.

==Olympic salute==
[[File:GraRuebAmsterdam.JPG|thumb|''The Olympic Salute'' sculpted by [[Gra Rueb]], sculpted for the [[1928 Summer Olympics]] in Amsterdam.]]
The Olympic salute is a variant of the [[Roman salute]], with the right arm and hand stretched and pointing upward, the palm outward and downward, with the fingers touching. However, unlike the Roman Salute, the arm is raised higher and at an angle to the right from the shoulder.&lt;ref name="1924poster"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://olympic-museum.de/poster/poster1924.htm| title=Paris 1924 - Jeux Olympiques| last=Droit| first=Jean| year=1924| publisher=Olympic Games Museum| accessdate=15 March 2010| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100829002316/http://olympic-museum.de/poster/poster1924.htm| archivedate=29 August 2010| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schaap"&gt;{{cite book |last=Schaap |first=Jeremy |title=Triumph: the untold story of Jesse Owens and Hitler's Olympics |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |year=2007 |pages=163–166 |isbn=978-0-618-68822-7| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DSsdGalGcPMC&amp;q=olympic+salute#v=snippet&amp;q=olympic%20salute&amp;f=false| subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The greeting is visible on the official posters of the games at [[1924 Summer Olympics|Paris 1924]]&lt;ref name="1924poster" /&gt; and [[1936 Summer Olympics|Berlin 1936]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://olympic-museum.de/poster/poster1936.htm|title=Olympic Games 1936 Berlin: Poster|year=1936|publisher=Olympic Games Museum|accessdate=29 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Olympic salute has fallen out of use since [[World War II]] because of its strong resemblance to the [[Nazi salute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2012/08/the-official-olympic-salute-stopped-being-popularly-used-after-wwii-due-to-strongly-resembling-the-heil-hitler-salute/|title=The Official Olympic Salute Stopped Being Popularly Used After WWII Due to Strongly Resembling the "Heil Hitler" Salute|date=2012-08-08|work=Today I Found Out|access-date=2017-09-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was used for the last time by the French team in the opening ceremony of the [[1948 Winter Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfaFnZ6sEnY/|title= Full St. Moritz 1948 Official film ; see 13:15 to 13:20&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mascots==
{{See also|List of Olympic mascots}}
Since the [[1968 Winter Olympics]] in [[Grenoble]], France, the [[Olympic Games]] have had a [[mascot]], usually an animal native to the area or occasionally human figures representing the cultural heritage. The first major mascot in the Olympic Games was [[Misha]] in the [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in Moscow. Misha was used extensively during the opening and closing ceremonies, had a TV animated cartoon and appeared on several merchandise products. Nowadays, most of the merchandise aimed at young people focuses on the mascots, rather than the Olympic flag or organization logos.

==Intellectual property==

The Olympic movement is very protective of its symbols; as many jurisdictions have given the movement exclusive trademark rights to any interlocking arrangement of five rings, and usage of the word "Olympic". The rings are not eligible for copyright protection, both because of their date of creation and because five circles arranged in a pattern do not reach the [[threshold of originality]] required to be copyrighted.

The movement has taken action against numerous groups alleged to have violated their trademarks, including the [[Gay Games]]; the [[Minneapolis]]-based band [[The Hopefuls]], formerly The Olympic Hopefuls; the Redneck Olympics or [[Redneck Games]]; [[Awana|Awana Clubs International]], a Christian youth ministry who used the term for its competitive games; and [[Wizards of the Coast]], publisher at the time of the IOC's complaint of the card game ''[[Legend of the Five Rings]]''.

In 1938, the Norwegian brewery Frydenlund patented a label for its root beer which featured the five Olympic rings. In 1952, when Norway was to host the Winter Olympics, the Olympic Committee was notified by Norway's Patent Office that it was Frydenlund who owned the rights to the rings in that country. Today, the successor company [[Ringnes|Ringnes AS]] owns the rights to use the patented five rings on its root beer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://search.patentstyret.no/Trademark/31784/26743?searchId=472094&amp;caseIndex=9|title=Norwegian Patent Office record of the Frydenlund patent, showing the design|date=1 November 1938|accessdate=20 November 2016}} Ringnes is the family name of the company's founders.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a few other companies have been successful in using the Olympic name, such as Olympic Paint, which has a paintbrush in the form of a torch as its logo, and the former Greek passenger carrier [[Olympic Airlines]].

Certain other sporting organizations and events have been granted permission by the IOC to use the word "Olympics" in their name, such as the [[Special Olympics]], an international sporting event held every four years for people with intellectual disabilities.

In recent years, organizing committees have also demanded the passing of laws to combat [[ambush marketing]] by non-official sponsors during the Games &amp;ndash; such as the [[London Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Act 2006]] &amp;ndash; putting heavy restrictions on using any term or imagery that could constitute an unauthorized association with the games, including mere mentioning of the host city, the year, and others.&lt;ref name=independent-180712&gt;{{cite news|last=Anderson |first=Steve |title=The Debate: Have Olympic sponsorship regulations gone too far? |url=http://blogs.independent.co.uk/2012/07/18/the-debate-have-olympic-sponsorship-regulations-gone-too-far/ |accessdate=21 July 2012 |date=18 July 2012 |work=The Debate (blog)(The Independent) |location=London |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120721030057/http://blogs.independent.co.uk/2012/07/18/the-debate-have-olympic-sponsorship-regulations-gone-too-far/ |archivedate=21 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=atalantic-130712&gt;{{cite news |last=O'Sullivan |first=Feargus |title=The Pettiness of Olympic Branding |url= http://www.theatlanticcities.com/arts-and-lifestyle/2012/06/pettiness-olympic-branding/2256/ |accessdate=21 July 2012|newspaper=[[The Atlantic]] |location=Washington D.C. |date=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''priority draft pick''' is a type of draft selection in the [[Australian Football League]]'s [[AFL Draft]]. Priority draft picks are additional draft picks, located at or near the start of the draft, which are given only to the poorest performing teams, to provide additional help for those teams to improve on-field performances in future years. Prior to 2012, a team automatically received a priority draft pick if its win-loss record met pre-defined eligibility criteria; since 2012, priority draft picks will be awarded on a discretionary basis by the AFL commission.&lt;ref name="2012 changes" /&gt;

The priority draft pick has been the consistent subject of controversy, as several poor-performing teams have been accused of '''tanking''' during the later part of the season to ensure that they qualify for the additional draft pick.

==AFL Draft==
At the conclusion of each AFL season, there are three [[AFL draft]]s: the National Draft, the Pre-Season Draft and the Rookie Draft. The National Draft is the most important of the drafts, as it is the primary recruitment method for prospective young players once they reach the age of 18.

In the draft, the selections are arranged into rounds, with each team having one selection per round. Selections in each round are arranged in reverse ladder position order.

==Priority draft pick rules==
Under current AFL rules, enacted from the 2012 season onwards, a club can receive a priority draft pick at the discretion of the AFL Commission.

A formula which will assist with determining whether or not a team receives a priority draft pick, and at which round in the draft that pick will be taken, has been developed that takes into account such factors as:
* premiership points that a club has received over a period of years (with greater weight to recent seasons), 
* a club's percentage (points for/points against x 100) over a period of years (another indication of on-field competitiveness, with greater weight to recent seasons), 
* any finals appearances that a club has made in recent seasons,
* any premierships that a club has won in recent seasons, and 
* a club's injury rates in each relevant season.&lt;ref name="2012 changes"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/afl/afl-scraps-priority-pick/story-e6frf9jf-1226277216720|title=AFL scraps priority pick|accessdate=21 Feb 2012|date=21 Feb 2012|first=Al|last=Paton|newspaper=Herald Sun}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the [[Brisbane Lions]] became the first club to be awarded a priority draft pick under the current rules.&lt;ref name="lions"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.afl.com.au/news/2016-10-06/afl-grants-struggling-lions-priority-draft-pick|title=AFL grants struggling Lions a priority pick|last=Ryan|first=Peter|date=6 October 2016|work=AFL.com.au|publisher=[[Bigpond]]|accessdate=6 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, through a series of trades in [[2016 AFL draft|that year's AFL draft]], the [[Sydney Swans]], who had finished as minor premiers in [[2016 AFL season|the season that had just passed]] and reached the [[2016 AFL Grand Final|Grand Final]], ended up with it instead.&lt;ref name="swans"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afl.com.au/news/2016-10-20/swans-land-top10-draft-selection-after-late-flurry-of-pick-swaps-with-power|title=Swans land top-10 selection after late pick swaps with Power|publisher=AFL.com.au|first=Travis|last=King|date=20 October 2016|accessdate=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Swans used this pick to draft [[Will Hayward]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sydneyswans.com.au/news/2016-11-25/pick-21-hayward|title=Pick 21: Will Hayward|publisher=[[Sydney Swans]]|date=25 November 2016|accessdate=16 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Priority round history==
The draft was established in 1986 in an attempt to reduce the inherent inequities of the league under [[Zoning (Australian rules football)|zoning]], where the clubs with the most successful zones, such as  Carlton, Collingwood and Essendon, were able to perennially dominate the competition, while teams with weaker zones, such as St Kilda, Sydney and Footscray, were perennially close to or at the bottom of the ladder. The draft was intended to give the weakest teams access to the best prospective players.

===First priority round amendment===
By 1993, some of the weakest teams (e.g. Sydney Swans, Brisbane Bears and Richmond) were still enduring prolonged periods of poor performance, so the priority draft pick was introduced in the [[1993 AFL Draft|Draft of that year]] to further assist these teams. In its first incarnation:
* Teams received a priority draft pick if they finished with less than 20.5 premiership points (five wins) for the season.
* The entire priority round took place prior to the first round of the National Draft.
* Where more than one team participated in the same round of priority picks, selections were made in reverse ladder position order, as is the case for normal selection rounds.

It became clear, however, that a team with reasonable prospects could finish with five wins and receive a roster boosting priority draft pick as a result of an isolated poor season due to key players suffering injuries, internal dissent and/or other off-field trouble. This was unfair and counterproductive to the initial ''[[wikt:raison d'être|raison d'être]]'' of the priority pick, which was to help consistently poor teams with minimal or no prospects to rebuild.

For this reason, the AFL made further amendments to the priority pick rules in 2006.

===2006 priority round amendment===
From the 2006 draft, a club became eligible for a priority draft pick in the National Draft if it finished a season with fewer than 16.5 premiership points (four wins). The location of the priority draft picks within the overall National Draft now depended upon the team's performance over the previous two years: 
*Where the team finished with more than 16.5 premiership points in the previous season, and fewer than 16.5 premiership points in the current season, the priority draft pick was taken between the first and second rounds of the National Draft.
*Where the team finished with fewer than 16.5 premiership points in both the previous season and the current season, the priority draft pick was taken prior to the first round of the National Draft.

Another way to describe this is that in a sequence of consecutive poor seasons, the priority draft pick in the first season would be taken after the first round, and any second or subsequent priority draft picks would be taken before the first round.

===2012 priority pick reform===

Despite the best efforts of the AFL, the priority draft pick became controversial in the late 2000s and early 2010s because of the potential for corruption, as it could be automatically awarded based on the performance of the club over the past two seasons with a defined cut-off point (16.5 premiership points or four wins).

In the 2012 pre-season, the AFL, with the unanimous support of the 18 clubs, removed the provision for priority picks automatically based upon finishing results, and with the AFL commission retaining the power to award priority picks on a discretionary basis.&lt;ref name="2012 changes" /&gt;

To allow for this situation, a formula has been developed that takes into account such factors as:
* premiership points that a club has received over a period of years (with greater weight to recent seasons), 
* a club's percentage (points for/points against x 100) over a period of years (another indication of on-field competitiveness, with greater weight to recent seasons), 
* any finals appearances that a club has made in recent seasons,
* any premierships that a club has won in recent seasons, and 
* a club's injury rates in each relevant season.
To eliminate the perception of tanking, the formula for priority picks is kept confidential by the AFL Commission.

In 2016, the [[Brisbane Lions]] became the first club to be given a priority draft pick under the current rules, with that pick located after the first round&lt;ref name="lions"/&gt; (although {{AFL Syd}} ended up with the pick after the trade period).&lt;ref name="swans"/&gt;

==Tanking==
There was annual speculation that poor performing teams manipulated their results after they were eliminated from finals contention, in order to ensure they remain below the eligibility criterion and receive a priority pick under the pre-2012 format; this was referred to as "[[Match fixing#Reasons for and means of fixing matches|tanking]]."&lt;ref name="GD05"&gt;{{citation|first=Greg|last=Denham|newspaper=The Australian|date=5 Aug 2011|accessdate=15 July 2014|title=Watchdog backs AFL on tanking|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/sport/watchdog-backs-afl-on-tanking/story-e6frg7mf-1226108538420}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a wide variety of behaviours which could be considered to be tanking. These include:
*Instructing the players to deliberately lose matches
*Employing unusual tactics in matches, including using players in positions where they do not usually play&lt;ref name="GD05" /&gt;
*Resting star players with minor injuries, who would likely not be rested if the team were contesting finals&lt;ref name="07GL"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/do-blues-need-another-win-or-a-riewoldt/story-e6frf9if-1111114075010|title=Do Blues need a win, or a Riewoldt?|publisher=Herald Sun|first=Garry|last=Lyon|date=31 July 2007|accessdate=25 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Playing younger players who do not yet have much experience at AFL level&lt;ref name="libba" /&gt;

While all of these behaviours can be interpreted as an attempt to avoid winning matches, all but the first point can also be justified as a sensible player management and development strategy for a team with no chance of playing finals, which complicates the debate about tanking. In addition, tanking has the significant issue that fans of these clubs sometimes openly support against their teams on game day;&lt;ref name="07GL" /&gt; however, this could also be justified as a sign of fan dissatisfaction at the club's poor performance and/or its administration.

Also complicating the debate is the fact that different people have different opinions on what is acceptable behaviour. When speaking about {{AFL WCE}}'s 2010 priority draft pick, coach [[John Worsfold]] openly defended his right to play young players in unfamiliar positions to assist their development;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westcoasteagles.com.au/news/2011-08-03/experimentation-not-tanking-worsfold|first=Nathan|last=Schmook|publisher=West Coast Eagles|date=3 Aug 2011|accessdate=25 February 2015|title=Experimentation not tanking: Worsfold}}&lt;/ref&gt; but, when speaking about {{AFL Car}}'s 2007 priority draft pick, assistant coach [[Tony Liberatore]] said he personally thought it was wrong to play younger players in place of senior players whose niggling injuries would not be bad enough to force their omission if the team were playing finals,&lt;ref name="libba" /&gt; and [[Brock McLean]] revealed that he requested to be traded away from the [[Melbourne Football Club]] because he disagreed with similar strategies in the lead-up to Melbourne's 2009 priority draft pick.&lt;ref name="MHDT" /&gt;

The legal implications of tanking on sports betting is also a significant problem,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac;jsessionid=7C6F6CE0714B3FFA74A92250B9542DB0?sy=afr&amp;pb=all_ffx&amp;dt=selectRange&amp;dr=1month&amp;so=relevance&amp;sf=text&amp;sf=headline&amp;rc=10&amp;rm=200&amp;sp=brs&amp;cls=845&amp;clsPage=1&amp;docID=AGE110803N87L160K37I|title=Legal risk over tank admissions|first=Jon|last=Pierik|newspaper=The Age|date=3 Aug 2011|accessdate=11 Nov 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2009 a betting agency temporarily suspended betting on the wooden spoon when it became concerned about the potential legal ramifications if tanking or other corruption were ever proven.&lt;ref name="GD05" /&gt; The penalty for any player or official found to have been involved in tanking is a possible lifetime suspension and/or a fine of $100,000 for each offence.

By shifting the Priority Round from before to after the First Round in 2006, the AFL reduced the incentive to tank, but did not eliminate it; the incentive was reduced further with the 2012 reform. The AFL has the endorsement of the Victorian Commission for Gambling Regulation that the integrity of the game is sufficiently protected under the priority system.&lt;ref name="GD05" /&gt;

Some members of the media, particularly from the ''[[Herald Sun]]'', previously called for the priority draft pick to be scrapped altogether, and some journalists call for a [[Sports draft|draft lottery]] to be applied in the first round for the bottom five or six teams. When asked in 2011, the [[AFL Players Association]]'s official position was that it would like to see the priority pick abolished due to the perception of tanking and its impact on the public's confidence in the game, rather than any suggestion of actual corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/afl/afl-news/club-chiefs-happy-to-tank-20110805-1iflp.html|newspaper=The Age|first=Samantha|last=Lane|title=Club chiefs 'happy to tank'|date=6 Aug 2011|accessdate=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statements alluding to tanking===
In 2011, sacked {{AFL Mel}} coach Dean Bailey stated that he coached to "ensure the club was well placed for draft picks" in 2008 and 2009, and admitted to playing players in unusual positions, but he never claimed that the team had deliberately lost matches.&lt;ref name="GD05" /&gt; [[Tony Liberatore]] made similar statements in 2008, when he claimed that he felt like "winning wasn't the be all and end all" when Carlton received a priority pick in 2007, but he also said that he'd never seen anything to suggest that players were deliberately losing matches.&lt;ref name="libba"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=ABC News|date=15 July 2014|accessdate=10 Nov 2011|title=Carlton tanked: Liberatore|url =http://www.abc.net.au/news/2008-03-13/carlton-tanked-liberatore/1071980}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both cases, the statements were seen as an admission of guilt to tanking by some, but in the absence of an explicit directive to deliberately lose, acceptable by others,&lt;ref name="GD05" /&gt; and the AFL was satisfied that neither team had broken its tanking rules.&lt;ref name="MHDT"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/afl/afl-to-interview-brock-mclean-over-tanking-claims/story-e6frf9io-1226438966390|title=AFL to interview Brock McLean over tanking claims|date=31 July 2012|accessdate=31 July 2012|newspaper=Herald Sun|first1=Mark|last1=Hayes|first2=Daryl|last2=Timms}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cooper"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/afl/afl-news/integrity-intact-demons-20130219-2epml.html|title=Integrity intact: Demons|first=Adam|last=Cooper|newspaper=The Age|date=20 February 2013|accessdate=20 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Notable matches in the tanking debate===
;Round 22, 2007 – Melbourne vs Carlton
The [[2007 AFL season#Round 22|Round 22, 2007]] match between {{AFL Mel}} and {{AFL Car}}, nicknamed the '''Kreuzer Cup''', was the most controversial match in the tanking debate. It was the last match of the regular season, and both Melbourne and Carlton had a record of 4–17, meaning that whichever team won the match would lose the chance at a priority draft pick, and both clubs had already avoided the ignominy of the [[wooden spoon (award)|wooden spoon]], as {{AFL Ric}} had secured it with a final record of 3–18–1. Overall, this meant that there was no benefit for either club to win, but a significant benefit to losing.

The stakes were particularly high in Carlton's case, because the club had also received a priority pick in the 2006 season; as such, if it lost this match, it would receive the No. 1 draft pick as its priority pick. In Melbourne's case, the priority pick it could have received would be the No. 18 pick; the No. 1 pick would go to wooden spooners Richmond if Melbourne lost the match. The match became known as the Kreuzer Cup, named after [[Northern Knights]]' ruckman [[Matthew Kreuzer]], who had been expected to be (and was eventually, by Carlton) selected with the No. 1 pick in the [[2007 AFL Draft]].

The match was high scoring, played with low intensity, poor skills and very little defensive pressure, and two players (Carlton's [[Heath Scotland]] and Melbourne's [[Travis Johnstone]]) gathered more than 40 disposals. Melbourne had a five-goal lead by quarter time, and ended up winning the match 21.13 (139) to 15.18 (108). Carlton went on to recruit Kreuzer with the No. 1 pick in the draft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://au.sports.yahoo.com/news/article/-/8217951/demons-finish-season-on-a-high/polls/popup/-/poll_id/63414/|date=29 October 2010|accessdate=10 Nov 2011|publisher=Sportal|title=Demons finish season on a high|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405023115/http://au.sports.yahoo.com/news/article/-/8217951/demons-finish-season-on-a-high/polls/popup/-/poll_id/63414/|archivedate=5 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Round 18, 2009 – Melbourne vs Richmond
Melbourne entered the match with a record of 3–14. Because it had received a priority draft pick in 2008, it had the potential to receive a priority draft pick at the start of the draft if won no more than one of its final five matches.

The match was close for much of the game, but Melbourne kicked away to lead by a few goals in the final quarter. Richmond was then able to make a comeback, and an [[after-the-siren kicks in Australian rules football|after-the-siren goal]] by [[Jordan McMahon]] gave Richmond a four-point win. The ''[[Herald Sun]]'' later accused coach Melbourne coach Dean Bailey of making positional changes in the final quarter which were so nonsensical that they could only have been designed to ensure Richmond would make a comeback: this included moving key defenders [[James Frawley]] and [[Matthew Warnock]] into the forward-line, resting key midfielders, and using [[Brad Miller (footballer)|Brad Miller]] as a ruckman.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|newspaper=Herald Sun|first=Jon|last=Ralph|date=3 Aug 2011|accessdate=10 Nov 2011|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/afl/how-melbourne-tanked-in-2009/story-fn6cisdj-1226107012777|title=How Melbourne tanked in 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2012 and early 2013, Melbourne was thoroughly investigated for its conduct in this and other games which occurred in late 2009. The club was found not guilty of tanking,&lt;ref name="Cooper"/&gt; but guilty of bringing the game into disrepute and was fined $500,000, with Bailey (who was fired as coach in 2011) being suspended for 16 matches and football operations officer Chris Connelly being suspended for 12 months.

[[File:Tommy Haas serves.jpg|thumb|[[Tommy Haas]] serving]]
A '''serve''' (or, more formally, a '''service''') in [[tennis]] is a shot to start a [[point (tennis)|point]]. A player will hit the ball with a racquet so it will fall into the diagonally opposite service box without being stopped by the net. Normally players begin a serve by tossing the ball into the air and hitting it (usually near the highest point of the toss). The ball can only touch the net on a return and will be considered good if it falls on the opposite side. If the ball contacts the net on the serve but then proceeds to the proper service box, it is called a ''let''; this is not a legal serve in the major tours (but see below) although it is also not a ''fault''. 
Players typically serve overhead, but serving underhand, although rare, is allowed. The serve is the only shot a player can take their time to set up instead of having to react to an opponent's shot.  But as of 2012, there is a 25-second limit to be allowed between points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2012/09/atp-changes-time-violation-penalty/39398/ |title=ATP changes time violation penalty |last=Cronin |first=Matt |publisher=Tennis.com |date=September 12, 2012 |access-date=March 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The serve is one of the more difficult shots for a novice, but once mastered it can be a considerable advantage. Advanced players can hit the serve in many different ways and often use it as an offensive weapon to gain an advantage in the point or to win it outright. Because of this, players above beginner level are expected to win most of their service games, and the ability to [[Tennis terminology#B|break]] an opponent's serve plays a crucial role in a match.

For any serve, the server stands behind the baseline without touching it. For the first point of any [[game (tennis)|game]], the server stands to the right of the center point of the baseline and serves diagonally across the net to the left side (from the server's perspective) of the court, into the [[tennis terminology#S|service box]] which extends to the service line about midway into the opponent's court. For the second point of the game, the serve is diagonally from the left to the right side of the court, and for each subsequent point of the same game the positioning is the opposite of that on the previous point.

== Rules ==

An attempt at a serve may result in one of the following outcomes:
* a good serve
* a let
* a fault
* (very rarely) immediate award of the point to the server.

=== Good ===

A ''good serve'' occurs when a legally delivered ball lands in the cross-court service box or on any line bounding it without touching anything in flight. Once a ''good serve'' is hit, the play begins.

=== Let ===

A ''let'' occurs when a legally delivered ball lands in the cross-court service box having touched the net cord (but not the net post or any other object).{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}&lt;!-- This explanation is not a valid reference. Please provide one. &lt;ref&gt;As of 1999, in [[NCAA]] Division I collegiate tennis, a let service is considered playable. This rule change was made to prevent receivers from falsely claiming a valid service to be a let, which is a call that cannot be overruled. Thus, a service that hits the net before landing in the service box is a playable shot, and must be returned by the receiver. Otherwise, the receiver loses the point.&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt; Play stops immediately, and the server is allowed another attempt.  The umpire (or opposing player when there is no umpire) will usually say "let" or "net" to signal to the server a let has occurred. Lets occur more often on first serves, as the server is more cautious on the success of a second serve{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}.

=== Fault ===

There are multiple reasons why a service attempt may result in a fault.
*  A ''foot fault'' takes place when the server assumes an illegal position while serving.  The server's feet may touch only the ground behind the baseline, between the extensions of the center line and the sideline.  The server's feet must not touch the baseline or the extension of the center line or sideline at any time before the ball is struck. The server is also required to stay roughly on the same position to prevent the opponent from being misled as to where the serve will originate. Running or walking while serving is not allowed, however jumping is permitted.
* Illegal release of the ball.  The server must release the ball from one hand (exceptions are made for one-handed players, who may use the racket to release the ball).
* A miss.  If the server swings but misses the ball, it is a fault.  However, if a server releases the ball but does not attempt to hit it, there is no fault and the server may repeat the service attempt.&lt;ref name="serve_rules"&gt;International Tennis Federation: Rules of Tennis 2011 - Rule 19. SERVICE FAULT, Case 1: After tossing a ball to serve, the server decides not to hit it and catches it instead. Is this a fault?
Decision: No. A player, who tosses the ball and then decides not to hit it, is allowed to catch the ball with the hand or the racket, or to let the ball bounce.[http://www.itftennis.com/shared/medialibrary/pdf/original/IO_54581_original.PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;
* If the ball, before bouncing, hits any object other than the net cord, the opponent's racket or body, it is a fault. For example, if the ball hits the net post and then bounces into the correct court, the service is still a fault.
* If the ball fails to clear the net, or bounces anywhere other than the cross-court service box, it is a fault.

After a fault, play stops immediately.  If there has been only one fault on this point, the server is then allowed another attempt.  If there have been two faults on this point, the point is awarded to the receiver:  this is known as a ''{{visible anchor|double fault}}''.

=== Award of point to the server ===

On a service, the receiver is required to allow the ball to bounce before attempting to hit it.   In the extremely rare event of the receiver's racket or body touching a legally delivered ball before it bounces, the point is immediately awarded to the server.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itftennis.com/media/136148/136148.pdf Laws of tennis, 24(e)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== First and second ==

A ''first serve'' is made when there has been no fault on the point;  a ''second serve'' occurs when there has already been one fault on the point.  On a second serve, the server is in danger of losing the point if there is another fault.

The rules make no distinction between the first and second serve. However, the tactics used are different. The first serve is typically struck with the maximum power, skill, and deception the player is capable of with the aim of winning the point either outright or on the next stroke, by forcing the receiver into a disadvantageous position. The second serve is usually more conservative to avoid getting a double fault, and is typically hit with less power or a higher curve. Second serves often have more topspin and kick on the ball.

== Stances ==

There are two popular stances in the tennis serve: the platform stance and the pinpoint stance.

In the platform stance the feet are kept about shoulder-width apart throughout the serve, providing stable support and easy weight transfer from the back to the front foot. The hips rotate, and sometimes the back foot swings forward to complete the hip rotation.

In the pinpoint stance, the feet start apart, but as the serve unfolds, the back foot slides or steps forward until it is adjacent to or slightly behind the front foot. As a result, the feet provide a very small base of support and balance may be a problem.

=== Advantages of platform stance and the pinpoint stance ===

The pinpoint serve provides better velocity, since the feet come together as a single unit, allowing them to push harder against the ground and gain more leg power.  However, the center of gravity moves more than in the platform stance, so the player must have good body control in order to contact the ball consistently.
 
Players will sacrifice some power with the platform serve, but their balance will be better so they should be more consistent. It's still possible to produce good power with the platform serve—some big servers, such as Milos Raonic and Roger Federer, use a variation of a platform stance.

The serve each player uses will depend on their individual abilities and what they need the most—power or consistency.
If they already have good body control but would like to produce extra power, they could try the pinpoint stance. If consistency is their problem, they can use the platform stance.

=== Alternative stances ===

Platform stance and the pinpoint stance are closed stances. Fore a very long time, players who used an open stance to serve has been regarded as a sign of tennis beginner. Things have changed in recent years. At elite level, Venus Williams had used semi-open stance to serve in the past (she went back to use traditional closed stance and stayed to the old way currently). Beside Venus, Nikola Mektic &lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0Xq7m3sagE&lt;/ref&gt; and Viktor Troicki &lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llcFOZMQ72Y&lt;/ref&gt; both have abandoned closed stance to use open stance to serve.

== Types ==

In the game of tennis, there are four commonly used serves: the "flat serve", the "slice serve", the "kick serve", and the "underhand serve".{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} All of these serves are legal in professional and amateur play.

The term ''kick serve'' is ambiguous. It may be used as a synonym for the twist serve or the American twist. However, ''kick serve'' is commonly used to refer to any serve with heavy topspin or kick on it.

Servers can gain a tactical advantage by varying the type of serve and the ball's placement. The flat serve and slice serve are used primarily as first serves because they are more likely to yield an ace or force an error, although they require high accuracy. Second serves usually have topspin or kick on them, which makes them less likely to land in the net or out of bounds. Kick serves also make a good change-up{{clarify|date=July 2012}} as a first serve.

=== Flat ===

A flat serve is hit with a [[Grip (tennis)#The Continental grip|Continental grip]] (holding the racket as if it were an axe) and a swing path directly through the ball, which causes the ball to cut quickly through the air without spinning. Some professional players can hit flat serves at speeds near {{convert|150|mph|kph}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/sport/tennis/aussie-smashes-tennis-serve-speed-record-20120513-1ykfk.html|title=Aussie smashes tennis serve speed record|date=May 13, 2012|publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=March 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A flat serve must come close to the net therefore having a small margin for error. Therefore, flat serves are usually hit straight across the center, where the net is lowest. They are usually delivered as first serves, when the server does not risk a [[Glossary of tennis terms#D|double fault]]. The ball is thrown straight above and slightly forward for the optimal serving point.

=== Slice/reverse slice ===

A slice serve is hit with sidespin, which requires the server to brush the back of the ball toward their [[Handedness|dominant side]] with the racket. It is commonly hit with the Continental grip or the [[Grip (tennis)#The Eastern Forehand grip|Eastern backhand grip]] (using the forehand face of the racket). The ball is thrown slightly to the dominant side of the server then is struck laterally on the server's dominant side.

For a right-handed player, a sliced serve's sidespin [[Magnus effect|causes the ball to curve]] leftward. When the ball bounces, it skids and curves farther leftward. The curve of a good slice serve can draw the receiver {{convert|10|ft|m}} wide of the singles sideline to play the ball.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Since a slice serve has little or no topspin on it, it cannot be aimed high over the net and has little margin for error. Therefore, it is generally used as a first serve. It can be used to ace the receiver, to draw the receiver out of position, or to "jam" the receiver with a serve curving sharply towards his or her body.

The reverse slice serve (or inside-out serve) is analogous to the [[Screwball |screwball pitch]] in baseball.  It is hit with the opposite spin of the slice serve.  The server must [[Pronation|pronate]] his or her racket arm and sweep the racket across his or her body while striking the ball when hitting a reverse slice serve.  Because the direction of spin applied is reversed relative to the standard slice serve, a reverse slice serve from a right-handed player will have the same motion as a slice serve from a left-handed player, and ''vice versa''.

In professional and amateur tennis, the reverse slice serve is rarely used except as a novelty. As the word ''reverse'' is defined, one must hit opposite to the side and opposite to the path of the slice struck serve.{{clarify|date=July 2012}}

=== Kick/topspin/American twist/Reverse kick ===

[[Holcombe Ward]] and [[Dwight F. Davis|Dwight Davis]] introduced the kick/American twist serve in the late 1800s. The kick (or topspin) serve is generated by tossing the ball over the head, then hitting it laterally on the server's [[Handedness|non-dominant side]] brushing upward toward the dominant side. When hit correctly, the ball clears the net in a high [[Arc (geometry)|arc]] with heavy topspin, causing the ball to dive into the service box. Upon hitting the surface of the court, the ball may bounce high directly toward the receiver for a kick serve, or to the left for the receiver for an American twist serve. The physics of the spinning ball in flight involves the [[Magnus effect]] because the spinning ball creates a whirlpool of air around itself. The twist serve is a more extreme version of the kick serve, which involves more brushing of the ball from the 7–8 o'clock position to the 1–2 o'clock position, and faster swing speeds. If performed exceptionally, it can completely change the direction of the ball movement away from the other player, although this requires a very strong and flexible back.

Kick/topspin serves are often used as both first and second serves.  As a first serve, a player will put more pace on the ball, while it is a consistent second serve since the spin brings it into the service box with high net clearance.

The reverse kick/American twist serve is rarely used except as a novelty. As the word "reverse" is defined, one must hit opposite to the side and opposite to the path of the kick struck serve.{{clarify|date=July 2012}}

=== Underhand ===

The underhand serve is struck below shoulder level. In children's tennis, young children may be encouraged to use the underhand serve on {{convert|36|ft|m}} courts. Although this serve is legal, it may be seen as unsportsmanlike in adult tennis. Some notable examples include [[Michael Chang]]'s in the Round of 16 at the [[1989 French Open]] against [[Ivan Lendl]], and [[Martina Hingis]] was booed by the crowd for hitting one at the [[1999 French Open]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Fendrich |first=Howard |title=Hingis makes return to French Open quarterfinals |accessdate=29 July 2012 |newspaper=Ocala Star-Banner|date=6 June 2006 |agency=Associated Press |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=EQlQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=OgkEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6848,2862868 |quote=She [Hingis] was booed for hitting an underhanded serve}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pat-a-cake===

A [[Pat-a-cake, pat-a-cake, baker's man|pat-a-cake]] serve is a serve in which the racket is not swung behind the head (as in a proper serve). The player will simply toss the ball up and "pat" or tap it over the net to get it in play. It is often used by beginning players, or players who never had proper instruction. The term is usually employed belittlingly.

== Terminology ==

* [[Ace (tennis)|Ace]] &amp;ndash; a serve that lands in the service box and is then untouched by the opponent.
* Break &amp;ndash; server losing his or her game.
* Break point &amp;ndash; one point away from a break.
* [[Hawk-Eye|Challenge]] &amp;ndash; when either player disputes whether the ball landed in or out. A line judge may overturn a call made, or in professional settings, a review of the play may be made. Players are allowed a certain number of challenges per match.
* Double fault &amp;ndash; hitting a fault on the second service. The server loses the point.
* Fault &amp;ndash; an unsuccessful serve that does not start the point because the ball does not land in the opponent's designated service box.
* Foot fault &amp;ndash; a fault caused by the server stepping on or across his base line or the center line before striking the ball with his racquet.
* Hold &amp;ndash; server winning the game.
* Let &amp;ndash; a serve is called a let when the ball hits the net cord but still lands in the service court. Such a serve is not considered a fault and the server may repeat the service attempt. A ball that hits the net cord but lands outside the service box is still a fault.
* On serve &amp;ndash; both players have held each of their service games in the set or had an equal number of service breaks in the set, putting them "back on serve".
* Service winner &amp;ndash; a serve that is touched by the opponent, but not returned.

==Returning==

Since the server has the advantage of being the initial aggressor, for his opponent to return the ball and to keep it in play often involves the defensive endeavor of minimizing the opponent's advantage.  
This may involve simply lunging to get the racket on the ball before it passes. If a controlled return of service is possible, a hard [[groundstroke]] to one side or the other of the opponents's [[tennis terminology#B|baseline]] may be performed. If the server rushes the net immediately upon hitting the serve, the returner has several options: return the ball at the feet of the server not far past the net, forcing him to hit a [[half volley]] (which is hard to do aggressively); [[lob (tennis)|lob]] the ball over the rushing server's head; or hit a [[passing shot]] hard and low over the net too far to the left or right for the server to hit it.

== History ==

Sherdog was created by photographer Jeff Sherwood (nicknamed "Sherdog") in 1997 and was later refined with the help of Garrett Poe.&lt;ref&gt;

Sherdog is also home to the Sherdog Radio Network, an internet-only sports talk network featuring Sherdog writers and staffers. Weekly programs have included ''The Savage Dog Show'' hosted by Greg Savage and Jeff Sherwood, ''Beatdown'' hosted by TJ De Santis and a number of co-hosts, ''It's Time'' hosted by [[Bruce Buffer]] and ''The Jordan Breen Show''.

Until recently, the standard schedule included ''Beatdown'' on Monday, Wednesday and Friday, ''It's Time'' on Tuesdays, ''Cheap Seats'' on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and ''The SRN Rewind'' every Sunday evening. Also included for big events were SRN Roundtables providing previews and "Beatdown After the Bell" for post-fight recaps.

As of April 8, 2016, the SRN was rebuilt after Jeff Sherwood and his namesake website parted ways.  The current lineup of programming includes ''Cheap Seats'' with Jordan Breen and Greg Savage on Mondays and Wednesdays which was cancelled after the organization and Greg Savage parted ways as well. ''TJ &amp; The Tooth'' with TJ De Santis and Nick "The Tooth" Gullo on Tuesdays, and ''The Neutral Corner'' hosted by MMA veteran [[Yves Edwards]]. Still standard for high-profile events are Jack Encarnacao's SRN Roundtables providing previews and TJ De Santis' "Beatdown After the Bell" for post-fight recaps. While not officially a part of the Sherdog Radio Network, the SRN feed also includes ''Press Row'' audio blogs starring Jordan Breen and various guests in the world of MMA media.  While not officially cancelled, Jack Encarnacao's ''The SRN Rewind'' has been on an extended hiatus, and the flagship show ''Beatdown'' has been discontinued as a live radio show since the exiting of Jeff 'Sherdog' Sherwood.

Sherdog has also affiliated with ESPN to provide extensive MMA content for their site. The deal includes ESPN sharing Sherdog's extensive Fight Finder database. The deal would also include the Sherdog Radio Network being part of ESPN's podcast center.&lt;ref&gt;

The website also has a [[XenForo]]forum section composed of more than 60 thousand members from all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forums.sherdog.com/ Forums.sherdog.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The site hosts free live streams of mixed martial arts events from organizations such as Palace Fighting Championships, Wargods and [[M-1 Global]].

'''Specific Physical Preparedness''' (abbreviated '''SPP'''), also referred to by '''Sports-specific Physical Preparedness''' is the status of being prepared for the movements in a specific activity (usually a [[sport]]).

Specific training includes movements specific to a sport that can only be learned through repetition of those movements. For instance, shooting a [[free throw]], running a [[marathon]], and performing a [[handstand]] all require dedicated work on those skills. An SPP phase generally follows a phase of [[General Physical Preparedness]], or GPP, which lays out an athletic base from which to build.

Related movements that mimic certain aspects of the movement which can be specialized in and put together to form it are also part of specific training.

A record attendance of 9,700 was set in March 1991 for the [[1990–91 Yugoslav Cup|Marshals Cup]] match against [[HNK Hajduk Split|Hajduk Split]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140413093621/http://www.setaliste.com.mk/sport/fudbal/7833-koj-mec-e-so-rekordna-poseta-pod-tumbe-kafe Кој меч е со рекордна посета под Тумбе кафе?]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Pelister have hosted European cup matches at Tumbe Kafe on four occasions. Swiss club [[FC St. Gallen|St. Gallen]] was the last team to visit the stadium back on 9 August 2001 for the [[2001–02 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/season=2001/matches/round=1550/match=67840/index.html 2001/02 UEFA Cup Pelister-St. Gallen]&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium is most remembered for the violence that occurred back on 13 June 1993, before a [[1992–93 First Macedonian Football League|Macedonian First League]] fixture between eternal rivals Pelister and Vardar. The match never got started because Pelister supporters [[Čkembari]] set fire to the wooden bleacher seats, collapsed the old protective fence and clashed with the police. During the incident, most of the south stand was destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oEXHnE43uIQ&amp;list Pelister-Vardar Incidenti 93ta ]&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2010, several [[necropolis]]es were discovered at Tumbe Kafe that may date back to the third century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sott.net/articles/show/211200-Archaeologists-Stumble-Upon-Ancient-Necropolises-During-Stadium-Reconstruction
|title=Archaeologists stumble upon ancient necropolises during stadium reconstruction ||first=|last=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 June 2012, the stadium was host to a [[2011–12 First Macedonian Football League|relegation/promotion]] play-off match between [[FK Teteks]] and [[FK Skopje]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macedonianfootball.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=4656:teteks-remains-in-first-league&amp;catid=1:domestic&amp;Itemid=63 Teteks remains in First League for next season]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reconstruction and expansion==
On 8 April 2014, Bitola mayor Vladimir Taleski along with architectural firm MEGARON Engineering from [[Skopje]], promoted a new stadium reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FDbA-hvaN8 Promovirano idejnoto resenie za noviot stadion vo Bitola]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the plan, the construction work is set to begin in June 2014 and the investment is worth over €8&amp;nbsp;million. The stadium will have a [[seating capacity|capacity]] of 12,000 seats and would be a [[UEFA stadium categories|UEFA category]] two standard which means it will be able to host European and international matches. Three new stands are to be built and the current southern stand is to be overhauled, along with adding an [[Tartan track|athletic track]] around the pitch. In the press release Taleski stated, "We are going to build a stadium that Bitola has never had since the time of [[Heraclea Lyncestis|Heraclea]]. The realization of the project will start on June 1, where the largest investment and contents are related to the northern stand which is to amount to about €4.5&amp;nbsp;million, while the total amount of the whole stadium is around €8&amp;nbsp;million."&lt;ref&gt;[http://bitola.gordsys.net/?proekt_stadion_4_14 Презентиран проектот за новиот фудбалскиот стадион под Тумбе кафе] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416182826/http://bitola.gordsys.net/?proekt_stadion_4_14 |date=16 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.republika.mk/?p=116947 Bitola to get contemporary stadium]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sakame Stadion campaign==
In 2014, citizens of Bitola began an internet campaign called "''Sakame Stadion''", or "We Want a Stadium".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/pages/%D0%A1%D0%B0%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%B5-%D0%A1%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%BE%D0%BD/163203187221583 Граѓанска иницијатива за изградба на нов, модерен стадион Тумбе Кафе во Битола]&lt;/ref&gt; The main reason for the campaign was to generate support for building a new stadium in Bitola. It was also to bring notice of the current stadium's deteriorating condition and put pressure on mayor Taleski to fulfil his campaign promise from 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvAF6MmafH0 Stadium under Tumbe cafe in Bitola is situated in a desperate situation]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvjhcMQvfpA Изјавите на градоначалникот Владимир Талески]&lt;/ref&gt; The "''Sakame Stadion''" motto has now been used on hundreds of occasions, by fans, citizens and representatives of the Macedonian diaspora around the world. Photos of people holding the message on paper are published regularly online, among those from famous sportsmen (most notably footballers [[Goran Pandev]] and [[Gonzalo Higuaín]]), reporters, celebrities, officials and football clubs from Macedonia and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stadiumdb.com/news/2014/09/macedonia_waiting_for_stadium_in_btiola_and_waiting Macedonia: „Waiting for the stadium in Bitola!"

'''Stadium Municipal de Toulouse''' is the largest [[multi-purpose stadium]] in [[Toulouse]], France. It is currently used mostly for [[association football|football]] matches, mainly those of the [[Toulouse FC|Toulouse Football Club]] and the big games of rugby for [[Stade Toulousain]] in the [[European Rugby Champions Cup]] or [[Top 14]]. It also hosts the test matches of [[France national rugby union team|France's national rugby union team]]. It is located on the island of Ramier near the centre of Toulouse. It is a pure football and rugby ground, and therefore has no athletics track surrounding the field. The stadium is able to hold 33,150 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fussballtempel.net/uefa/listeuefa2.html|title=Football stadiums of the world – Stadium List Europe - Football stadiums of the world|author=|date=|website=www.fussballtempel.net|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium was built in 1937 for the [[1938 FIFA World Cup]] and has undergone two extensive renovations, in 1949 and 1997.

The stadium staged six matches during the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://1800-worldcup.com/world_cup_finals/france1998/matches.htm#Toulouse|title=France 1998 World Cup matches, by Stadium. Toulouse: Stadium Municipal|work=1800-WorldCup.com|publisher=TravelNotes.org|accessdate=5 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was also used as a host venue during the [[2007 Rugby World Cup]] for games such as Japan-Fiji, won by the latter 35–31. On 13 November 2009 the stadium hosted international rugby again when France hosted South Africa. At the time, South Africa were leading the series by 20 wins to 10 (6 drawn).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ticketbooth.org.uk/rugby-tickets/games/France-South-Africa-rugby-tickets.php France v South Africa 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Jackson]] performed in front of 40,000 people during his [[Dangerous World Tour]] on 16 September 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ladepeche.fr/article/2011/06/29/1117739-michael-jackson-revient-deux-fois-a-toulouse.html |title=Michael Jackson Returns Twice to Toulouse|date=June 29, 2011 |publisher=[[La Dépêche du Midi]] |access-date=November 11, 2018 |quote=Michael Jackson only came once to Toulouse , on September 16, 1992.
