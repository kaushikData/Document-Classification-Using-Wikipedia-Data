The '''Amphibian Ark''' (or '''AArk''') is a joint effort of three principal partners: the [[World Association of Zoos and Aquariums]] (WAZA), the [[IUCN Species Survival Commission#Conservation Breeding Specialist Group|IUCN/SSC Conservation Breeding Specialist Group]] (CBSG), and the [[IUCN Species Survival Commission#Amphibian Specialist Group|IUCN/SSC Amphibian Specialist Group]] (ASG).

The AArk was formed to address the ''[[ex situ]]'' components of the Amphibian Conservation Action Plan&lt;ref&gt;http://www.amphibianark.org/pdf/ACAP.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; (ACAP). Its vision is the world’s amphibians safe in nature, and its mission is ensuring the global survival of amphibians, focusing on those that cannot be safeguarded in nature.

Amphibian Ark staff&lt;ref name="amphibianark.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amphibianark.org/staff.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080613173520/http://www.amphibianark.org/staff.htm |archivedate=2008-06-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; coordinate ''ex situ'' [[Amphibians|amphibian]] programs implemented by partners around the world, with the first emphasis on programs within the range countries of the species, and with an obligation to couple ''ex situ'' conservation measures with protection or restoration of species in their natural habitats.

An AArk Steering Committee,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.amphibianark.org/aarkorganization.htm#SteeringCommittee&lt;/ref&gt; with Executive Co-Chairs from each of the three principal partners, provide guidance on the activities of the AArk and ensure communication with stakeholders.

A number of dedicated positions&lt;ref name="amphibianark.org"/&gt; coordinate implementation within the AArk initiative; assist AArk partners in priority taxa&lt;ref&gt;http://www.amphibianark.org/conservation_planning_workshops.htm{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; identifying and regions for ''ex situ'' conservation work; lead development and implementation of training programs&lt;ref&gt;http://www.amphibianark.org/husbandryworkshops.htm&lt;/ref&gt; for building capacity of individuals and institutions; and develop communications strategies, newsletters&lt;ref&gt;http://www.amphibianark.org/newsletter.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and other messages, and materials to promote understanding and action on behalf of amphibian conservation.

Advisory Committees have been formed to consult on species-specific issues, for example, [[reintroduction]], [[gene bank]]ing, and veterinary, legal, and ethical concerns.

Members of the AArk are WAZA members and WAZA affiliates, members of regional or national [[zoo associations]], [[International Species Information System|ISIS]], AArk approved private partners and AArk approved museums, universities and wildlife agencies.

Although action to save critical species from immediate [[extinction]] will be to send them to facilities with space and expertise, the goal is to enable the range countries currently lacking facilities and expertise to care for their own species. This will allow outside experts to free up their time and space to begin the process anew with other species in other regions of the world.

'''''Crimean chamber''''' ({{lang-uk|Кримська світлиця}}, in transliterated form "Krymska svitlytsia") is the only national Ukrainian newspaper in Crimea. It is published since 31 December 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.radiosvoboda.org/a/news/27638027.html|title=Українськомовна газета «Кримська світлиця» більше не виходитиме у Криму|website=Радіо Свобода}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its profile changed more than once during its existence, sometimes covering mostly social and political topics, sometimes becoming more literary and historical in its content, but always focusing on Crimean themes.

Since 2006 the "Crimean chamber" editorial works as a part of the state-owned enterprise (SE) "National newspaper and magazine publishing".

As a result of the [[Russian occupation of Crimea]] in March 2014, the publisher had to stop the printed version of newspaper since February 2015, so that for over a year the newspaper existed only in electronic format. However, by an order of the publisher's board of directors in May 2016 the newspaper's editorial got evacuated from the occupied peninsula to Kiev, and after a forced break, since July 2016 the publishing of the printed version of "Crimean chamber" resumed in [[Kiev]].

The entire editorial staff of the newspaper "Crimean chamber" are people from [[Crimea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://detector.media/infospace/article/116734/2016-07-12-u-kievi-povidomili-pro-vidnovlennya-prodazhu-gazeti-krimska-svitlitsya/|title=У Києві повідомили про відновлення продажу газети «Кримська світлиця»|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Crisalide (Vola)'''" is a song recorded by [[San Marino|Sammarinese]] singer [[Valentina Monetta]]. The song was written by [[Ralph Siegel]] and Mauro Balestri. It is best known as [[San Marino in the Eurovision Song Contest 2013|San Marino's entry]] to the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2013]] held in [[Malmö]], [[Sweden]].&lt;ref name=SMR1&gt;{{cite web|last=Roxburgh|first=Gordon|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=its_valentina_monetta_again_for_san_marino|title=It's Valentina Monetta again for San Marino|work=Eurovision.tv|date=30 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song competed in the second semi-final on 16 May 2013 for a spot in the final on 18 May 2013, however it failed to qualify. It finished in 11th place with 47 points, which, at the time, was San Marino's best result in the competition before they qualified for the final in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2014|2014]]

The [[time signature]] of the first part of the song is 12/8, and 4/4 of the second part.

'''Democratic Renewal''' ({{lang-ca|Renovació Democràtica}}, RD) is a social-liberal [[political party]] in [[Andorra]].

==History==
For the [[Andorran parliamentary election, 2005|2005 parliamentary elections]] the party was part of an alliance with the [[Social Democratic Party (Andorra)|Social Democratic Party]] and [[Parochial Union of Independents Group]] named '''L'Alternativa'''.&lt;ref name=NS&gt;[[Dieter Nohlen|Nohlen D]] &amp; Stöver P (2010) ''Elections in Europe: A data handbook'', p164 {{ISBN|978-3-8329-5609-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The alliance won twelve seats.

The party did not contest the [[Andorran parliamentary election, 2009|2009 elections]], but instead supported [[Andorra for Change]], which won three seats.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipu.org/parline-e/reports/arc/2005_09.htm Elections in 2009] IPU&lt;/ref&gt; It did not participate in the [[Andorran parliamentary election, 2011|2011 elections]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipu.org/parline-e/reports/2005_E.htm Latest elections] IPU&lt;/ref&gt;

Baron '''Gaston de Gerlache de Gomery''' ([[Brussels]], 17 November 1919 – [[Oudenaarde]], 13 July 2006) was a [[Belgium|Belgian]] polar explorer.

Gaston de Gerlache was the son of [[Adrien de Gerlache]] and followed in the tracks of his father by leading the second Belgian expedition to [[Antarctica]] in 1957-1958, 60 years after his father led the 1897-1899 [[Belgica_Expedition|Belgian Antarctic Expedition]] with the ship [[RV Belgica (1884)|Belgica]].

Gaston de Gerlache and his crew established the [[Baudouin I of Belgium|King Baudouin]] Base in 1958 in the context of the [[International Geophysical Year]]. On [[December 11]], [[1958]] an aircraft with four Belgians, led by Gaston de Gerlache crashed in Crystal Mountains, 250 km from King Badouin Base, Antarctica. The crew was searched for and rescued on [[December 16]] by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] polar pilot V. M. Perov on [[Li-2]] aircraft, that took off from [[Mirny Station]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015019278947;view=1up;seq=456 Rescue of Belgian Plane Crew in Antarctic], Soviet Bloc International Geophysical Year Information, January 16, 1959, U. S. Department of Commerce, pp. 18-19&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960 Gaston de Gerlache published his travel journal ''Retour dans l'antarctique''. A year later he made a documentary about his expedition named ''Plein sud''.

An article, "Belgium in the Antarctic", written by Gaston de Gerlache de Gomery appeared in the Geographical magazine (May 1962 issue).

[[Mount Gaston de Gerlache]] in the [[Queen Fabiola Mountains]] on Antarctica was named after him.

'''Hareskoven''' or '''Hareskovene''' (plural) is a forested area straddling the boundary between [[Fresø Municipality|Furesø]] and [[Gladsaxe Municipality|Gladsaxe]] municipalities in the northwestern suburbs of [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]]. Fægyden, a road between [[Hareskovby]] and [[Værløse]], separates '''Store Hareskov''' in the west from '''Lille Hareskov''' to the west. The forested area has a combined area of c. 808 hectares.

==History==
The first part of the name (Hare- or Harre-) is derived from the Norse word ''[[Hörgr]]'', meaning altar or cult site.

Hareskov was severely damaged during the [[Dano-Swedish War (1658–60)|Swedish Wars]] in the late 1650s. At the end of the war it was concluded that "the forest will only be able to feed 90 pigs". It was therefore protected for the next few years while it recovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://naturstyrelsen.dk/naturoplevelser/naturguider/hareskovene/historie/historie/#Kongelig_jagtskov|language=Danish|publisher=DNaturstyrelsen|accessdate=24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecology==
Harskov consists mainly of [[beeach|beech forest]] with scattered oak, linden and maple trees. Notable solitaire trees include the three ancient oak trees Skrædderen "The Tailor"), Grenaderen and Djævelen /"The Devil"). The latter used to look like a devil's hand reaching out for the sky. It was partly destroyed in a storm in 1981 but is still alive.

==Historic features==
Hareskoven contains a total of six [[dolmen]]s from the Stone Age. The largest one is located close to Sandskredshus at [[Skovbrynet station]].

Two examples of earthworks from the Swedish Ears known as Lejrens Indelukke and Svenskervolden can still be seen in the southern part of the forest.

==Activities==
Hareskoven forest contains a network of [[bridle path]]s for horseback riding as well as a trail for mountain biking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://naturstyrelsen.dk/publikationer/2014/sep/hareskovene/|title=Hareskovene|language=Danish|publisher=DNaturstyrelsen|accessdate=24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Head of the Republic of Mari El''' (formerly '''President of Mari El Republic''') is the highest executive position in the [[Mari El Republic]], a [[Federal subjects of Russia|federal subject]] of the [[Russian Federation]].

The first President of Mari El Republic was [[Vladislav Zotin]] when the position was created on December 24, 1991, two days before [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], replacing the [[First Secretary of the Mari Communist Party]], the equivalent position of the [[Mari ASSR]] before it was succeeded by the Mari El Republic. The status and powers of the President were determined by Chapter 4 of the Constitution of the Mari El Republic. In December 2010, Russian President [[Dmitry Medvedev]] signed a law that forbade calling the heads of federal subjects as "president", and must bring their constitutions or statutes in conformity with the law before January 1, 2015. The position of President of Mari El Republic was renamed to Head (''Vuylatyshyzhe'' in [[Mari language|Mari]]) in June 2011.

Since 6 April 2017 the Head of the Mari El Republic is Aleksandr Yevstifeyev.

The '''Indian Ocean Rim Association''' (IORA), formerly known as the Indian Ocean Rim Initiative and Indian Ocean Rim Association for Regional Cooperation (IOR-ARC), is an [[international organisation]] consisting of coastal states bordering the [[Indian Ocean]].&lt;ref name="intro"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://iora.net/about-us/membership.aspx | title=IORA Membership | publisher=Indian Ocean Rim Association | accessdate=7 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IORA is a regional forum, tripartite in nature, bringing together representatives of Government, Business and Academia, for promoting co-operation and closer interaction among them. It is based on the principles of Open Regionalism for strengthening Economic Cooperation particularly on Trade Facilitation and Investment, Promotion as well as Social Development of the region.&lt;ref name="intro2"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://iora.net/about-us/how-iora-operates/scope-of-work.aspx | title=Scope of Work - OPEN REGIONALISM | publisher=Indian Ocean Rim Association | accessdate=7 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Coordinating Secretariat of IORA is located at [[Ebene Cybercity, Mauritius|Ebene]], [[Mauritius]].

==Overview==
The organisation was first established as Indian Ocean Rim Initiative in [[Mauritius]] on March 1995 and formally launched on 6–7 March 1997 by the conclusion of a [[multilateral treaty]] known as the Charter of the Indian Ocean Rim Association for Regional Co-operation.&lt;ref name="iora"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://iora.net/about-us/background.aspx | title=Formation | publisher=Indian Ocean Rim Association | accessdate=7 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea is said to have taken root during a visit of former South African Foreign Minister, [[Pik Botha]], to India in November 1993. It was cemented during the subsequent presidential visit of [[Nelson Mandela]] to India in January 1995. Consequently, an Indian Ocean Rim Initiative was formed by [[South Africa]] and [[India]]. Mauritius and Australia were subsequently brought in. In March 1997, the IOR-ARC was formally launched, with seven additional countries as members: Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Yemen, Tanzania, Madagascar and Mozambique.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.futuredirections.org.au/publication/the-indian-ocean-rim-association-for-regional-co-operation-india-takes-the-lead/&lt;/ref&gt;

The apex body of the IOR-ARC is the Council of (Foreign) Ministers (COM). The meeting of the COM is preceded by the meetings of the Indian Ocean Rim Academic Group (IORAG), Indian Ocean Rim Business Forum (IORBF), Working Group on Trade and Investment (WGTI), and the Committee of Senior Officials (CSO).&lt;ref name="abut"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iorarc2013.org/iora-2013/about-ior-arc.aspx | title=About IOR-ARC | publisher=Indian Ocean Rim Initiative and Indian Ocean Rim Association for Regional Cooperation 2013 Australia | accessdate=7 July 2014 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714224854/http://www.iorarc2013.org/iora-2013/about-ior-arc.aspx | archivedate=14 July 2014 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Objectives &amp; Priority Areas of Cooperation===
The objectives of IORA are as follows:&lt;ref name="iora"/&gt;
# To promote sustainable growth and balanced development of the region and member states
# To focus on those areas of economic cooperation which provide maximum opportunities for development, shared interest and mutual benefits
# To promote [[Liberalism|liberalisation]], remove impediments and lower barriers towards a freer and enhanced flow of goods, services, investment, and technology within the Indian Ocean rim.

The '''Jelar Formation''' or '''Jelar breccia''' is a stratigraphic unit in [[Croatia]]. It is a coarse-grained carbonate-breccia of [[Paleogene]] age. The breccia was deposited syntectonically during the development of the [[Dinaride Thrust Belt]]. The clasts are [[Mesozoic]] in age.&lt;ref name=tari1994&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://hrcak.srce.hr/19578?lang=en|last1=Tari|first1=Vlasta Kovačić|last2=Mrinjek|first2=Ervin|title=The Role of Palaeogene Clastics in the Tectonic Interpretation of Northern Dalmatia (Southern Croatia)|journal=Geologia Croatica|date=1994|volume=47|issue=1|accessdate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Karelianism''' was a late 19th-century cultural [[phenomenon]] in the [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] and involved writers, painters, poets and sculptors. Since the publishing of the Finnish national epic [[Kalevala]] in 1835, compiled from [[Karelia]]n folk lore, culture spheres in [[Finland]] became increasingly curious about Karelian heritage and landscape. By the end of the 19th century Karelianism had become a major trend  for many works of art and literature in Finland. In the movement Karelia was seen as a sort of refuge for the essence of "Finnishness" that had maintained its [[Authenticity in art|authenticity]] across centuries. The phenomenon can be interpreted as a Finnish version of European [[national romanticism]].

The painters [[Akseli Gallen-Kallela]] and [[Louis Sparre]] are usually mentioned as the founders of the movement. They were soon joined by the sculptor [[Emil Wikström]], the writers [[Juhani Aho]], [[Eino Leino]] and [[Ilmari Kianto]], the composers [[Jean Sibelius]] and [[P.J. Hannikainen]], the architects [[Yrjö Blomstedt]] and [[Victor Sucksdorff]], and many others. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.juminkeko.fi/viena/en/karelianismi.html Karelianism]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Later, towards the [[Second World War]], some of the ideas of Karelianism were taken over by an irredentist movement aspiring to create a larger Finland. Thus some of the ideas put forward by Karelianism were used as a motivation to the proposal of a [[Greater Finland]], a single state encompassing many [[Finnic people]]s.

{{Refimprove|date=July 2007}}
'''Kitchen gods''' are [[mythology|mythical]] beings that represent abstract concepts such as [[luck]] or just propel the minor changes of everyday life.  Little things that cannot be explained, such as losing small objects like socks in the laundry are often attributed to these creatures because the explanation eludes the believer.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2356">'''Liechtenstein heraldry''' is the form of [[heraldic]] art found in the country of [[Liechtenstein]]. It does not have a heraldic body of its own, relying on primarily [[Germany|German]] influences through the ruling house. It follows the [[Heraldry#German-Nordic_heraldry|German-Nordic tradition]].

==National coat of arms==


{{Main|Coat of arms of Liechtenstein}}
The coat-of-arms of the Princely House of Liechtenstein is also used as the great arms of the nation. As the sovereign emblem of the [[Principality]] of Liechtenstein, its use is reserved for the members of the Princely House and state authorities. Private individuals may be authorized to use the great arms, if it is in the interest of the State. The arms are a history of the Princely House, and show the many different areas of [[Europe]] with which Liechtenstein has been involved, either by conquest or by [[marriage]].

It has been in use since around 1630.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ngw.nl/int/oveur/li-nat.htm National Coat of Arms of Liechtenstein] on ''Heraldry of the World''. Accessed 2009-02-19.&lt;/ref&gt; It is referred to in blazon as:
''Quarterly (1) Or an Eagle displayed Sable crowned and armed of the first charged with a crescent trefly Argent ending in crosses (2) Barry of eight Or and Sable charged with crancelin Vert (3) Per pale Gules and Argent (4) Or a maiden eagle displayed Sable the human part Argent crowned and armed of the first (Enty in point chapé) in base Azure a Hunting Horn stringed Or (Overall) An Escutcheon per fess Or and Gules''

The whole achievement (entire rendering with supporters) is surrounded by the Princely cloak, or mantle, Purpure and lined Ermine and ensigned with the Princely hat.

==Municipal heraldry==
{{double image|right|Vaduz.png|100|Schaan.png|100|Coat of arms of Vaduz, left, and of Schaan, typical, right}}
Each of the eleven [[municipalities of Liechtenstein]] bears a shield, which contain a wide range of heraldic features. The capital municipality, [[Vaduz]], has the most complex, recognising its status as the home of the ruling house. [[Coat of arms|Coats of arms]] such as that of [[Schaan]] are typical, with a two or three colour [[Field (heraldry)|field]] and primary [[Charge (heraldry)|charge(s)]].

'''Lyutika''' ({{lang-bg|лютика}}, {{IPA-mk|liuˈtika|pron}}) is a traditional [[vegetable]] mixture — [[salad]] or chunky [[relish]], popular in the northern part of [[Bulgaria]]. It is consumed in the summer. Basic lyutika is made from roasted [[capsicum|pepper]]s, [[tomato]]es, [[garlic]], [[onion]]s, and [[vegetable oil]] usually crushed with a [[Mortar and pestle|pestle in a mortar]]. Often chopped [[parsley]] is added. Lyutika is served cold. The name comes from the pungent taste (''lyut'', meaning hot, pungent).

There are varieties of lyutika that include [[yogurt]], [[sirene]] (white cheese), hardboiled [[Egg (food)|egg]]s, or chunks of cooked [[Chicken (food)|chicken]] breasts.

'''Marsa Battery''' ({{lang-mt|Batterija tal-Marsa}}) was an [[artillery battery]] in [[Marsa, Malta|Marsa]], [[Malta]], built by Maltese insurgents during the [[Siege of Malta (1798–1800)|French blockade]] of 1798-1800. It was part of [[Fortifications of Malta#French occupation (1798–1800)|a chain of batteries, redoubts and entrenchments]] encircling the French positions in [[Marsamxett Harbour|Marsamxett]] and the [[Grand Harbour]].

The battery was built at the bottom of Jesuit Hill, close to the shoreline. [[Jesuit Hill Battery]] was located nearby on higher ground. The battery was small, and consisted of a small masonry parapet with three embrasures, a hardstone gun platform, a sentry room on the left, and a flanking rubble wall on the right. A magazine was also built to the rear of the battery. Marsa Battery was designed by Salvatore Camilleri from [[Valletta]].

Like the other French blockade fortifications, Marsa Battery was dismantled, possibly sometime after 1814. No traces of the battery can be seen today, and the area is now heavily industrialized. The site of the battery is now occupied by the [[Marsa Power Station]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Spiteri|first1=Stephen C.|title=Maltese ‘siege’ batteries of the blockade 1798-1800|journal=Arx - Online Journal of Military Architecture and Fortification|date=May 2008|issue=6|page=37|url=http://www.militaryarchitecture.com/images/stories/Arx/arx6-2008.pdf|accessdate=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sciuta Tower''' ({{lang-mt|Torri ta' Xuta}}), also known as '''Sciutu Tower''' ({{lang-mt|Torri ta' Xutu}}) or '''Wied iż-Żurrieq Tower''' ({{lang-mt|Torri ta' Wied iż-Żurrieq}}), is a small [[watchtower]] in [[Qrendi]], [[Malta]]. It was completed in 1638 as the fifth of the [[Lascaris towers]]. The tower was in a dilapidated state but it is currently being restored by [[Din l-Art Ħelwa]].

==History==
Sciutu Tower was built in 1638 in Wied iż-Żurrieq, close to [[Qrendi]], on the site of a medieval watch post.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zammit|first1=Vincent|title=Fortifications in the Middle Ages|journal=Civilization|date=1984|volume=1|page=33|publisher=PEG Ltd|location=[[Ħamrun]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It served as the prototype for the [[De Redin towers]], which were built between 1658 and 1659.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Attard|first1=David P.|title=The De Redin Tower|url=http://afm.gov.mt/file.aspx?f=496|website=[[Armed Forces of Malta]]|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6YvvlFucJ|archivedate=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the British took over Malta in 1800, Sciutu Tower remained in use and was manned by the Royal Malta Fencible Regiment and later the Royal Malta Fencible Artillery. It was abandoned in 1873 but was manned by the Coast Police once again during [[World War II]]. The tower subsequently used as a police station until 2002. An original cannon dating back to the Order's rule can still be found on the tower's roof.

'''Senegambia and Niger''' was a short-lived administrative unit of the colonial [[French West Africa]] possessions, in the region of present-day [[Niger]], [[French Sudan|Mali]] and [[Senegal]]. 

It was formed in 1902, and reorganized in 1904 into [[Upper Senegal and Niger]].

==Stamps==
{{Main|Postage stamps and postal history of Senegambia and Niger}}
Despite its brief existence, the French government still managed to issue [[postage stamp]]s for the administrative unit, in the form of a version of its [[Navigation and Commerce|Navigation and Commerce series]], inscribed "SENEGAMBIE / ET NIGER".

[[File:McDonaldization.jpeg|thumb|The McDonaldization of Society: 20th Anniversary Edition cover art]]
'''''The McDonaldization of Society''''' is a 1993 [[book]] by [[sociologist]] [[George Ritzer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Warner|first1=Malcolm|title=The McDonaldization of Society (book review)|journal=Journal of General Management|date=1 December 1993|volume=19|issue=2|pages=86-90|doi=10.1177/030630709301900207|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/030630709301900207?journalCode=gema|accessdate=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ritzer suggests that in the later part of the 20th century the socially-structured form of the [[fast-food restaurant]] has become the organizational force representing and extending the process of rationalization into the realm of everyday interaction and individual identity. [[McDonald's]] of the 1990s serves as the case model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The McDonaldization of society, 6th ed|journal=Reference &amp; Research Book News|date=August 2010|volume=25|issue=3|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/The+McDonaldization+of+society%2C+6th+ed-a0233054480|accessdate=2 January 2018|publisher=The Free Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book introduced the term [[McDonaldization]] to learned discourse as a way to describe a social process which produces "mind-numbing sameness", according to a 2002 review of a related academic text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gilbert|first1=Elllen D|title=Review: Fast Food, Fast Track: Immigrants, Big Business, and the American Dream|journal=Library Journal|date=15 April 2002|volume=127|issue=7|page=112|url=https://bepl.ent.sirsi.net/client/en_US/default/search/detailnonmodal/ent:$002f$002fSD_ILS$002f0$002fSD_ILS:1168840/ada|accessdate=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''McDonaldization'' Ritzer expands and updates central elements from the work of [[Max Weber]] and produces a critical analysis of the impact of social-structural change on human interaction and identity. The central theme in Weber's analysis of modern society was the process of [[Rationalization (sociology)|rationalization]]; a far-reaching process whereby traditional modes of thinking were replaced by an ends/means analysis concerned with efficiency and formalized [[social control]]. Weber argued that the [[Archetype|archetypal]] manifestation of this process was the [[bureaucracy]]; a large, formal organization characterized by a hierarchical authority structure, well-established [[Division of labour|division of labor]], written rules and regulations, impersonality and a concern for technical competence. Bureaucratic organizations not only represent the process of rationalization, the structure they impose on human interaction and thinking furthers the process, leading to an increasingly rationalized world. The process affects all aspects of everyday life.

The analyst is also able to enter a classification string, and include a declassification date, in the sample given: 20320108 is code for January 8, 2032.  There is a category labeled "Intelligence Purpose Information," in which the analyst is able to select a geopolitical area, topic and subtopic.&lt;ref name =WaPo2&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-broke-privacy-rules-thousands-of-times-per-year-audit-finds/2013/08/15/3310e554-05ca-11e3-a07f-49ddc7417125_story.html |title=NSA broke privacy rules thousands of times per year, audit finds |publisher=The Washington Post |date= |accessdate=2014-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The screen captures suggest that the tool gives the analyst the option of suggesting how often to forward new intelligence, and enter a reason for any higher priority requests.&lt;ref name=Guardian1/&gt; &lt;!--see: Forwarding precedence, Forwarding precedence reason --&gt;

The tool has the ability to build queries regardless of whether the target's name is known.

The presence of a [[ZIP code]] field on one of the released screen captures suggests that the tool may have the ability to collect within the United States, and not be limited to foreign intelligence gathering. There is a field for "Special Authorization," presumably for targets that the analyst needs special approval to select, such as US persons, or foreigners presently located within the US. &lt;!-- suggested by other documents --&gt; The screen captures suggest that the tool requires the analyst to enter a start and end date for the authorization, and a separate end date for the targeting itself to cease.&lt;ref name =WaPo2/&gt; &lt;!-- Note: see the delayed detasking violations in the reports; not yet clear if the UTT has this issue, but some other programs clearly do --&gt;

According to still undisclosed NSA documents from the collection of Edward Snowden, the UTT replaced the telephony targeting system OCTAVE in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Marcel Rosenbach &amp; Holger Stark, Der NSA Komplex, Deutsche Verlags-Anstalt, München 2014, p. 344&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Walls of Jerusalem''' ({{lang-ar|أسوار القدس}}; {{lang-he-n|חומות ירושלים}}) surround [[Old City (Jerusalem)|the Old City of Jerusalem]] (approx. 1&amp;nbsp;km²). In 1535, when Jerusalem was part of the [[Ottoman Empire]], [[Sultan]] [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Suleiman I]] ordered the ruined city walls to be rebuilt. The work took some four years, between 1537 and 1541.&lt;ref name="MurphyOConnor"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Holy Land: An Oxford Archaeological Guide from Earliest Times to 1700 |series=Oxford Archaeological Guides |author=Jerome Murphy-O’Connor |year=2008 |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=12 |isbn=978-0-19-923666-4 |quote= |url=https://books.google.co.il/books?id=m3Yy9FDcT8gC&amp;pg=PT48&amp;lpg=PT48&amp;dq=%22began+in+the+north+in+1537+and+continued+down+the+east+and+west+sides%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Hv7zZyYFL7&amp;sig=_pxHUiAqEHj3XHuagqxlnm8OJ1M&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjk7PDUuprKAhUB1BoKHa0eC0oQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22began%20in%20the%20north%20in%201537%20and%20continued%20down%20the%20east%20and%20west%20sides%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=8 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.antiquities.org.il/jerusalemwalls/hstry_12_eng.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

The length of the walls is 4,018&amp;nbsp;meters (2.4966&amp;nbsp;mi), their average height is 12 meters (39.37&amp;nbsp;feet) and the average thickness is 2.5 meters (8.2&amp;nbsp;feet). The walls contain 34 watchtowers and [[Gates in Jerusalem's Old City Walls|seven main gates]] open for traffic, with two minor gates reopened by archaeologists.

In 1981, the Jerusalem walls were added, along with the Old City of Jerusalem, to the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] List.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/archive/repext81.htm#148 Report of the 1st Extraordinary Session of the World Heritage Committee]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pre-Israelite city==
The city of Jerusalem has been surrounded by walls for its defense since ancient times. In the Middle [[Bronze Age]], a period also known in [[Hebrew Bible|biblical]] terms as the era of the [[Patriarchs (Bible)|Patriarchs]], a city named [[Jebusite|Jebus]] was built on the [[City of David|southeastern hill]] of Jerusalem, relatively small (50,000 square meters) but well fortified. Remains of its walls are located above the [[Siloam Tunnel]]. The identification of Jebus with Jerusalem has been disputed, principally by [[Niels Peter Lemche]]. Supporting his case, every non-biblical mention of Jerusalem found in the [[ancient Near East]] refers to the city as 'Jerusalem'. An example of these records are the [[Amarna letters]] which are dated to the 14th century BCE, several of which were written by the chieftain of Jerusalem [[Abdi-Heba]] and call Jerusalem either {{lang|akk-Latn|Urusalim}} ({{lang|akk-Latn|URU ú-ru-sa-lim}}) or {{lang|akk-Latn|Urušalim}}  ({{lang|akk-Latn|URU ú-ru-ša&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;-lim}}) (1330s BCE).&lt;ref&gt;''Urusalim'' e.g. in EA 289:014, ''Urušalim'' e.g. in [[Amarna letter EA 287|EA 287]]:025. Transcription online at {{cite web |url=http://www.tau.ac.il/humanities/semitic/EA263-end.html |title='&amp;#39;The El Amarna Letters from Canaan'&amp;#39; |publisher=Tau.ac.il |accessdate=11 September 2010}}; translation by [https://archive.org/details/dieelamarnatafel01knud Knudtzon 1915] (English in Percy Stuart Peache Handcock, ''[https://archive.org/stream/selectionsfromte00handuoft#page/10/mode/2up  Selections from the Tell El-Amarna letters]'' (1920).&lt;/ref&gt; Also in the [[Amarna letters]], it is called Beth-Shalem, the house of Shalem.&lt;ref&gt;See, e,g,, Holman Bible Dictionary, op. cit. supra.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Israelite city (ca. 1000–587/86 BCE)==
According to Jewish tradition, as expressed in the [[Tanakh]], Jerusalem remained a [[Jebusite]] city until the rise of [[David]], who [[Siege of Jebus|conquered Jebus]], renamed it [[City of David]] and started expanding it. His city was still located on the low southeastern hill, outside today's Old City area. [[Solomon]], David's son, built the [[First Temple]] on the hilltop rising right above the city he had inherited, the [[Temple Mount]], and then extended the city walls in order to protect the temple.

During the First Temple period the city walls were extended to include the northwest hill as well, i.e. the area where today's [[Jewish Quarter (Jerusalem)|Jewish]] and [[Armenian Quarter (Jerusalem)]] Quarters are located.

The entire city was destroyed in 587/86 BCE during the siege led by [[Nebuchadnezzar II|Nebuchadnezzar]] of Babylon.

==Jewish postexilic city==
After the [[Babylonian captivity of Judah|Babylonian captivity]] and the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] conquest of Babylonia, [[Cyrus II of Persia]] allowed the Jews to return to Judea and rebuild the Temple. The construction was finished in 516 BCE or 430 BCE. Then, [[Artaxerxes I]] or possibly [[Darius II]] allowed [[Ezra]] and [[Nehemiah]] to return and rebuild the city's walls and to govern Judea, which was ruled as [[Yehud]] province under the Persians. During the Second Temple period, especially during the [[Hasmonean]] period, the city walls were expanded and renovated, constituting what [[Josephus]] calls the First Wall. [[Herod the Great]] added what Josephus called the Second Wall somewhere in the area between today's Jaffa Gate and Temple Mount. [[Agrippa I]] (r. 41–44 CE) later began the construction of the Third Wall, which was completed just at the beginning of the [[First Jewish–Roman War]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Josephus]], ''De Bello Judaico'' (''Wars of the Jews'') v.iv.§ 2&lt;/ref&gt; Some remains of this wall are located today near the [[Mandelbaum Gate]] gas station.

==Aelia Capitolina and Byzantine Jerusalem==
In 70 CE, as a result of the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70 CE)|Roman siege]] during the [[First Jewish–Roman War]], the walls were almost completely destroyed. Jerusalem would remain in ruins for some six decades and without protective walls for over two centuries.

The pagan Roman city, [[Aelia Capitolina]], which was built after 130 by Emperor [[Hadrian]], was at first left without protective walls. After some two centuries without walls, a new set was erected around the city, probably during the reign of Emperor [[Diocletian]], sometime between 289 and the turn of the century. The walls were extensively renewed by the Empress [[Aelia Eudocia]] during her banishment to Jerusalem (443–460).

==Middle Ages==
[[File:Old City of Jerusalem and its Walls-108391.jpg|thumb|[[Damascus Gate]] with its [[crenelations]]]]
In 1033, most of the walls constructed by Eudocia were destroyed by an earthquake. They had to be rebuilt by the [[Fatimids]], who left out the southernmost parts that had been previously included: Mount Zion with its churches, and the southeastern hill (the City of David) with the Jewish neighborhoods which stood south of the Temple Mount. In preparation for the expected [[Crusades|Crusader]] siege of 1099, the walls were strengthened yet again but to little avail. The conquest brought some destruction followed by reconstruction, as did the reconquest by [[Saladin]] in 1187. In 1202 to 1212 Saladin's nephew, [[al-Mu'azzam|Al-Malik al-Mu'azzam 'Isa]], ordered the reconstruction of the city walls, but later on, in 1219, he reconsidered the situation after most of the watchtowers had been built and had the walls torn down, mainly because he feared that the Crusaders would benefit of the fortifications if they managed to reconquer the city. For the next three centuries, the city remained without protective walls, the [[Temple Mount]]/Haram ash-Sharif and the [[Tower of David|citadel]] then being the only well-fortified areas.

==Ottoman period==
In the 16th century, during the reign of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the region, Sultan [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] decided to rebuild the city walls fully, partly on the remains of the ancient walls. Being built 1535 and 1538, they are the walls that exist today.

An inscription in Arabic from the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Has decreed the construction of the wall he who has protected the home of Islam with his might and main and wiped out the tyranny of idols with his power and strength, he whom alone God has enabled to enslave the necks of kings in countries (far and wide) and deservedly acquire the throne of the Caliphate, the Sultan son of the Sultan son of the Sultan son of the Sultan, Suleyman.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imj.org.il/imagine/galleries/viewItemE.asp?case=7&amp;itemNum=374383 Building inscription commemorating the rebuilding of the walls of Jerusalem], Accession number: IAA 1942-265&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
