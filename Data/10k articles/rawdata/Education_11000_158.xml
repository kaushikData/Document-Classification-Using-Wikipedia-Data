'''Grading system in [[Morocco]]''' is mostly a 20-point grading scale, it is used in secondary schools as well as in universities.

Most of the time, the formal grades used in Morocco are not considered in graduate programs acceptance for some misunderstanding reasons : for instance, a grade of 12 (which is actually a passable grade in Morocco but equivalent to 60% in the US where it is considered a below average) is generally a good starting grade to apply for graduate studies and financial aids or scholarships.

But some European universities use a different admission requirement for Moroccan students. Morocco's neighboring countries, [[Algeria]] and [[Tunisia]], have a very similar grading system.

Morocco – besides these two countries – is deemed as endowed by a high academic standard, and draconian selection criteria and benchmarks for its students.

==Grading system==
The Moroccan grading system ranges from 0 to 20. It would be inaccurate to merely multiply a Moroccan grade by a factor 5 to find its Canadian or USA equivalent. A score 20 signifies perfection and is virtually never given. Score of 19 and 18 are equally rarely given. Depending on the subject and level, a 16 is an excellent grade. In yet other circumstances, a 12 may also be considered as an excellent grade, this especially so when it comes to the Social Sciences or humanities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.claudel.org/admin/orientation/pages/overview.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090906082452/http://www.claudel.org/admin/orientation/pages/overview.htm |archivedate=2009-09-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Theoretically an average student was rated 11/20; a brilliant student scored - 15/20. Practically most of the academic institutions had an average grade below 10; grades over 12/20 rated the best 10 to 15% of the class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://philippines.campusfrance.org/enseignement03.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091010164212/http://philippines.campusfrance.org/enseignement03.asp |archivedate=2009-10-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many systems, the full scale of grades is divided not only between pass and fail, but into various "classes" or "categories" corresponding to broad "quality labels" assigned to a certain bracket of numerical grades. Thus, in the United Kingdom, there are "First Class," "Second Class" (divided between upper and lower sub-classes) and "Third Class" performers, while French, German or Spanish students may be labeled in a similar way as, for example, Passable (Average), Gut (Good) or Sobresaliente (Outstanding).
The meaning of these labels in their own context is tainted by culture and tradition. Thus, a British "Third Class" (a pass mark, but usually given only to a relatively small number of very borderline students) is very different from a Moroccan Passable (a widely used label that normally applies to the vast majority of pass grades). However tempting it may be, equating "passable" with "Third Class" because they both correspond to the lowest label of "pass grades" would fail to take into account their real meaning.

As a consequence, conversion scales should pay considerable attention to categories/classes of grades. A first priority should be to make certain that this core piece of information is correctly rendered when converting foreign grades; fine-tuning within each particular class/category is only a subordinate exercise: what matters in Britain is whether the grade is a "First" or not, not whether it is a 71 or a 72. This observation is particularly relevant when converting grades from systems using a broad numerical scale into, for example, the U.S. system which usually has only three pass grades (or categories) corresponding to the letters A, B, and C. In the United States, a "D" may also be considered a passing grade, but not for transfer purposes.
The need to pay attention to grade classes reinforces the conclusion that linear methods, which ignore class boundaries, are nothing but fallacious and dangerous oversimplifications. They distort the original message in the same way as a word-for-word check in a bilingual dictionary: for each word there is a corresponding word in the other language, but the sequence of words thus obtained almost certainly means something different (or nothing at all) in the target language.&lt;ref name="wes.org"&gt;http://www.wes.org/gradeconversionguide/articlewindow.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mathematical Formulas Fail to Capture the Message'''
Both in Europe and in the United States, there have been numerous recent attempts to put together automatic, mathematical formulas that "calculate" foreign grades in the national grading system of the user. However, these formulas do not produce figures that are a reliable and fair reflection of the message conveyed by the original grade. Their main shortfall is that they cannot adequately deal with certain key characteristics of grading systems:
• Grading systems are not linear and are often characterized by a strongly skewed distribution of grades actually given to students. While American or Italian teachers would use the upper part of their grading scales (albeit in different ways), others (e.g., French and British) in practice hardly ever use the top 20% of their scale. For this reason, proposals based on linear formulas can produce devastating results: I recently saw the case of a German student in France who achieved a 15 (quite a good grade) which was converted into a German 2.5 (a rather mediocre one); on the contrary, a British student who gets a 27/30 in Italy would have every reason to be pleased if that grade were linearly calculated to correspond to a British 90/100!
• Many grading systems are not continuous, but divided into several "classes" or "categories" which correspond to broad levels of performance. This means that a small difference in numbers may conceal a substantial difference in meaning when a "class" limit is crossed: in the United Kingdom, a grade of 70 classified as "First Class" is very different from a 69 ("Second Class"), while the same small difference of 1 point is irrelevant between the grades of 54 and 55 (both "Lower Second Class").

• Grading differs not only between countries, but there are, as well, marked differences in grading traditions and policies depending on the type and level of the grading institution, the field of
study, or even the type of grade (final examination, mid-term, paper, or average computed from various grade items).

Taking France as an example, it is well known that grades at "classes préparatoires," which recruit among the best students on their way to "Grandes Ecoles," tend to be particularly low, with, for example, 11/20 seen as quite a strong grade, while the pass mark in France is usually an average of 10/20 calculated on all subjects. There may also be minimum pass grades per subject set at a lower level, for example, 8/20. 
The distribution of grades tends to be different between certain quantitative fields (with grades distributed over the whole range) and the non-quantitative fields (where grades are more concentrated in the middle, and the upper part of the scale is seldom used). Thus, even within a given country, a grade may have a "normal," intuitive, abstract meaning which needs to be adjusted (up or downwards) depending on a whole series of factors relating both to who gave it and who interprets it.
From the above observations, my main conclusion is that foreign grades are not just numbers that can be calculated by applying a mathematical formula, but a message that needs first to be understood in the original system and in a second stage interpreted by users in their own system.

'''Simple mathematical formulas with their claim to universality are nothing but a fallacious oversimplification of a reality they fail to capture'''
This, however, does not mean that the process of foreign grade interpretation cannot be organized in an efficient, expedient way based on a thorough effort to understand the message that [foreign grades] carry. It is possible to draw up tables ("grade equivalence chart," "grade concordance scale") that render a grade's "normal" or "average" meaning in another grading system, first on a bilateral basis and then in a more multi-lateral context. But this exercise has more to do with the complexity of human language than with mathematics. It takes more listening, modesty and flexibility rather than a doctrinal attitude and a creed in universal formulas/answers. More specifically, the drawing up of tables that can genuinely serve as a basis for interpreting foreign grades is only possible if a certain number of key considerations are observed. The remainder of the article presents six principles that could guide future developments in the area of foreign grade handling.&lt;ref name="wes.org"/&gt;

'''Alan Graham Apley FRCS''' (10 November 1914, [[London]] – 20 December 1996) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[orthopaedic surgeon]] and educator known for his textbook, ''Apley's System of Orthopaedics and Fractures'', and for the [[Apley grind test]] in [[Meniscus (anatomy)|meniscal]] injury.

== Biography ==
Alan Apley was born in London in 1914, the youngest son of [[Poles|Polish]] [[Jewish]] immigrants.&lt;ref name="BMJ"&gt;[http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/extract/314/7085/981 Alan Graham Apley Obituary. ''BMJ'' 1997; 314:981 (29 March)]&lt;/ref&gt; He studied medicine at [[University College Hospital]], qualifying [[MBBS]] in 1938. He became a [[Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons]] in 1941.

He served in the [[Royal Army Medical Corps|Army Medical Corps]] in [[Burma]] during the [[Second World War]]. After completing his training, he became a consultant at the [[Rowley Bristow Hospital|Rowley Bristow Orthopaedic Hospital]], [[Pyrford]], where he started his FRCS course in 1948. The "Pyrford Postgraduate Course", which became known as the "Apley Course", continued twice yearly for many years, with over 5,000 trainees attending them. Satellite courses were also set up in [[New York City]] and [[Toronto]], also running for over 15 years.&lt;ref name=whoswho /&gt; Notes from this course were turned into a textbook, Apley's ''System of Orthopaedics and Fractures'', which was first published in 1959,&lt;ref name=whoswho&gt;Seyed Behrooz Mostofi. ''Who's Who in Orthopaedics'', pages 13-15. Springer, 2005. {{ISBN|978-1-85233-786-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is now in its ninth edition.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Solomon, David Warwick, Selvadurai Nayagam. Apley's System of Orthopaedics and Fractures'', ninth edition. {{ISBN|978-0-340-94205-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He designed the first purpose-built [[emergency department]] in the south of [[England]] at [[St Peter's Hospital, Chertsey]]. He became director of orthopaedics at [[St Thomas' Hospital]] in 1972,&lt;ref&gt;{{WhoNamedIt|doctor|203|Alan Graham Apley}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was elected to the council of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England|Royal College of Surgeons]] in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bmj.com/cgi/issue_pdf/admin_pdf/3/5872.pdf ''British Medical Journal 21 July 1973.] Accessed on 26 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was Honorary Treasurer of the [[British Orthopaedic Association]] from 1972 to 1977, and received an Honorary Fellowship in 1985. He became editor of ''[[Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery|The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery]]'' in 1984. He delivered the [[Bradshaw Lecture]] at the Royal College of Surgeons in 1984 and was awarded the Honorary Medal of the Royal College of Surgeons.

He died in 1996.&lt;ref name=whoswho /&gt; A trauma care/orthopaedics ward at St Thomas' has been named after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guysandstthomas.nhs.uk/our-services/wards/alan-apley.aspx |title=Alan Apley Ward |publisher=Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust |accessdate=2015-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Black Economic Empowerment''' ('''BEE''') is a racially selective programme launched by the [[Government of South Africa|South African government]] to redress the inequalities of [[Apartheid]] by giving black  ([[Black people|Blacks]], [[Coloured]]s and [[Indian South Africans|Indians]]) South African citizens economic privileges not available to [[White South Africans|Whites]]. It is a form of [[Affirmative action]]. Although race is the overriding factor, it includes measures such as [[Affirmative action#South Africa|Employment Preference]], skills development, ownership, management, socioeconomic development, and preferential procurement.  By 2015 around [[South African rand|R]]350 billion (equivalent to [[United States dollar|US$]]24 billion) worth BEE deals had been done by the top 100 companies on the [[Johannesburg Stock Exchange|JSE]] with an additional R50 billion by private South African companies indicating that 10 percent of South Africa's GDP had been transferred to 20 percent of the population in the 15 years since 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.themessenger.global/Post/details/30569-the-great-bee-con|title=The great BEE con|last=Schussler|first=Mike|date=7 May 2018|website=www.themessenger.global|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rationale ==
After the transition from [[Apartheid]] in 1994, it was decided by the [[African National Congress]] government that direct intervention in the redistribution of assets and opportunities was needed to resolve the economic disparities created by Apartheid policies which had favoured white business owners. BEE intended to transform the economy to be representative of the [[demographics]], specifically race demographics of the country. BEE was defined in the 2001 Commission Report as follows,

{{Quotation|"It is an integrated and coherent socio-economic process. It is located within the context of the country’s national transformation programme, namely the RDP. It is aimed at redressing the imbalances of the past by seeking to substantially and equitably transfer and confer the ownership, management and control of South Africa’s financial and economic resources to the majority of its citizens. It seeks to ensure broader and meaningful participation in the economy by black people to achieve sustainable development and prosperity."|BEE Commission Report, pg. 2}}

Successful implementers of BEE also see it as a means to create economic growth in South Africa, and as vital to advance their corporate strategy.

The BEE programme was implemented starting from 2003. It was criticised for benefiting only a narrow stratum of previously disadvantaged groups, and this led in 2007 to the introduction of a modified programme called [[Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment]] or B-BBEE.

== Legislation ==

On 9 February 2007, the new Codes of Good Practice of the Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment were gazetted by the South African Government.

This included the following Codes:
*Code 100: Ownership
*Code 200: Management &amp; Control
*Code 300: Employment Equity
*Code 400: Skills Development
*Code 500: Preferential Procurement
*Code 600: Enterprise Development
*Code 700: Socioeconomic development
*Codes 800 – 807: Qualifying Small Enterprises

The following sector scorecards have also been gazetted (in terms of section 12):
*Financial Sector Scorecard&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Codes of Good Practice on Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment – Financial Sector Charter |work=Department of Trade and Industry |url=http://www.dti.gov.za/bee/beecharters/gazetteno610.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-08-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927200614/http://www.dti.gov.za/bee/beecharters/gazetteno610.pdf |archivedate=27 September 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Construction Sector Scorecard&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Codes of Good Practice on Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment – Construction Sector Charter |work=Department of Trade and Industry |url=http://www.dti.gov.za/bee/beecharters/gazetteno616.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-08-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927200646/http://www.dti.gov.za/bee/beecharters/gazetteno616.pdf |archivedate=27 September 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Tourism Sector Code&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Codes of Good Practice on Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment – Tourism Sector Codes |work=Department of Trade and Industry |url=http://www.thedti.gov.za/bee/beecharters/tourism.pdf |format=PDF }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also gazetted were general guidelines and definitions, among which, the definition of the beneficiaries of BEE. The definition is the same as that of the Black Economic Empowerment Act of 2003 which states that "black people" is a generic term which means Black Africans, Coloureds and Indians and included provisions to ensure that they must have been South African citizens prior to 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Codes of Good Practice on Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment – Schedule 1, Interpretation and Definitions |work=Department of Trade and Industry |url=http://www.dti.gov.za/bee/beecharters/schedule1.pdf |format=PDF|accessdate=2007-08-23}} {{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that Chinese individuals (some of whom were classified as Coloureds under Apartheid, others as [[honorary white]]), who were also submitted to legal discrimination prior to 1990 (but exempt from the Group Areas Act as of 1984 when the Group Areas Amendment Act was promulgated), have been excluded as beneficiaries of black empowerment, has led to a renewed media debate regarding the definition of "black" in current legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Vuyo Jack |title=Chinese people fall in grey area of BEE scorecard |work=Business Report |date=29 April 2007 |url=http://www.busrep.co.za/index.php?fSectionId=553&amp;fArticleId=3803052 |accessdate=2007-08-23 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927011730/http://www.busrep.co.za/index.php?fSectionId=553&amp;fArticleId=3803052 |archivedate = 27 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2008, Chinese people have been reclassified as "black" after the Chinese Association of South Africa took the South African government to court and won.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=S Africa Chinese 'become black' |work=BBC News |date=18 June 2008 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7461099.stm |accessdate=2011-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BEE legislation is supported and functions in conjunction with various other forms of Legislation, including the Employment Equity Act, Skills Development Act, Preferential Procurement Framework and others.

The legislation was developed through numerous task teams and have taken more than 3 years to be gazetted since the first Act (December 2003) and the first Codes of Good Practice released in November 2005 which addressed Statement 100 and 200. Subsequent Codes were released in December 2006 addressing Codes 300 to 700. Based on public and stakeholder comments, the final codes were adjusted and gazetted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The BEE Codes of Good Practice |work=Department of Trade and Industry |url=http://www.dti.gov.za/bee/beecodes.htm |accessdate=2007-08-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927200634/http://www.dti.gov.za/bee/beecodes.htm |archivedate=27 September 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 October 2013 updates to the Codes of Good Practice of the Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment were gazetted by the South African Government. These new Codes provided for a transitional period of 1 year 6 months. The changes include the consolidation of duplicate elements such as Employment Equity and Management Control and Preferential Procurement and Enterprise Development. The new Codes have increased the effort of compliance, by introducing priority elements; Ownership, Skills Development and Enterprise Development. The points allocation system includes sub-minimum targets thresholds of 40% for these priority elements, failing to achieve the thresholds result in penalties of dropping the compliance level.

The updated Codes were as follows:
*Code 000: Framework for Measuring Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment
*Code 100: Measurement of the Ownership Element of Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment
*Code 200: Measurement of the Management Control Element of Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment
*Code 300: Measurement of the Skills Development Element of Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment
*Code 400: Measurement of the Enterprise and Supplier Development Element of Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment
*Code 500: Measurement of the Socio-Economic Development Elements of Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment

Sector scorecards were given until March 2015 to submit sector charters.

==Scorecards==
Enterprises may be rated based on various scorecards, however only the following have been gazetted as of February 2007:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BB-BEE Codes of Good Practice |work=Department of Trade and Industry |url=http://www.dti.gov.za/publications/BB-BEE%20Codes%20of%20Good%20Practice%20Booklet121206.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-08-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927200552/http://www.dti.gov.za/publications/BB-BEE%20Codes%20of%20Good%20Practice%20Booklet121206.pdf |archivedate=27 September 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Generic Broad Based Scorecard
*Generic Narrow Based Scorecard
*[[Qualifying Small Enterprises]] Narrow Based Scorecard
*[[Qualifying Small Enterprises]] Broad Based Scorecard
*Financial Sector Scorecard
*Construction Sector Scorecard (repealed on 17 February 2016)

The last two, Financial Sector scorecard and Construction Sector scorecard, have not been passed into law. They were gazetted under section 12 of the act, which is for comment only. They will need to be gazetted in terms of section 9 of the act to become an official sector code. Until that happens all enterprises falling in these two industries are required to use the codes of good practice in producing a scorecard.

Significant leniency for Small Enterprises has been built into the gazetted codes. Based on the Qualifying Small Enterprises Codes, all companies with a turnover under R5 million p.a. is completely exempt from BEE and automatically qualifies as a level 4 contributor or achieves 100% BEE Contribution Recognition.

The generic broad based scorecard. All seven pillars must be addressed totalling 100 points

== Exemption ==
Small businesses, generally with a turnover of less than R10m, are considered to be [[Exempted Micro Enterprises]] and do not need to be measured against the BEE scorecards as stated above.

== Criticism ==

Critics argue that BEE's aim was to attempt to create equality of the workforce of South Africa as a whole by enforcing the advantaging of the previously disadvantaged and the disadvantaging the previously advantaged. This results in businesses having to consider the race and social background of any potential applicant instead of making decisions purely based on qualifications and experience,&lt;ref&gt;News Daily, 24 May 2004&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in a system in which one's race is often the determining factor in finding employment.

Instead of using this type of policy, critics suggest that a policy of qualification equality should be used. This would allow businesses to focus on employing the person with the highest qualifications, the most experience and the best recommendations. To allow previously disadvantaged individuals to achieve these qualifications and experience, critics{{who|date=May 2018}} of BEE say that the government should place more emphasis on secondary and tertiary education, as well as subsidising companies wishing to employ entry level applicants, or fund tertiary education for students from previously disadvantaged communities.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

In response to criticism, the South African Government launched [[Broad Based Black Economic Empowerment]] which is the current gazetted framework for addressing Black Empowerment beyond enriching a few, but with little effect.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

BEE has also been criticised for creating a [[brain drain]], where the qualified white expertise is emigrating to countries where they would not be discriminated against. [[Inkatha Freedom Party]] leader [[Mangosuthu Buthelezi]] is a strong critic of BEE and supports this view. He has stated that "the government's reckless implementation of the affirmative action policy is forcing many white people to leave the country in search of work, creating a skills shortage crisis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Buthelezi slams affirmative action |date=1 February 2007 |work=Mail &amp; Guardian |url=http://www.mg.co.za/articlepage.aspx?area=/breaking_news/breaking_news__national/&amp;articleid=297671 |accessdate=2007-08-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927215102/http://www.mg.co.za/articlepage.aspx?area=%2Fbreaking_news%2Fbreaking_news__national%2F&amp;articleid=297671 |archivedate=27 September 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Warning that South Africa is sitting on a "powder keg," Archbishop Desmond Tutu argued that Black Economic Empowerment only serves a few black elite, leaving millions in "dehumanising poverty".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tutu warns of poverty 'powder keg'  |date=23 November 2004 |work=BBC |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4035809.stm |accessdate=2009-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Centre for Sinai''' is a [[non-profit]], [[non-governmental]] organization created in 1998 to highlight and preserve the culture and history of the [[Sinai Peninsula]]. Based in South [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]], [[Egypt]], the Centre also aims to preserve the [[Bedouin]] way of life, so that the [[culture]] does not disappear like other cultures in the past. Centre for Sinai has a small [[library]] and also displays items of Bedouin culture such as jewelry, dress, utensils, and weapons.

The Centre offers expeditions into the desert by [[camel]] or mountain bike. The organization is also committed to cleaning up the Sinai and keeping it that way.

[[File:Student matching cloze terms on smartboard.jpg|thumb|A student dragging terms on a smartboard to fill cloze text]]
A '''cloze test''' (also '''cloze deletion test''') is an exercise, test, or assessment consisting of a portion of language with certain items, words, or signs removed (cloze text), where the participant is asked to replace the missing language item. Cloze tests require the ability to understand context and [[vocabulary]] in order to identify the correct language or part of speech that belongs in the deleted passages. This exercise is commonly administered for the assessment of native and second [[language learning]] and instruction.

The word ''[[wikt:cloze|cloze]]'' is derived from ''closure'' in [[Gestalt psychology|Gestalt theory]]. The exercise was first described by W.L. Taylor in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Taylor |first=W. L. |year=1953 |title=Cloze procedure: A new tool for measuring readability |work=Journalism Quarterly |volume=30 |pages=415–433}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Task design==
Words may be deleted from the text in question either mechanically (every nth word) or selectively, depending on exactly what aspect it is intended to test for. The methodology is the subject of an extensive academic literature;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=J. |last1=Sachs |first2=P. |last2=Tung |first3=R. |last3=Lam |title=How to Construct a Cloze Test: Lessons from Testing Measurement Theory Models |work=Perspectives |publisher=City University of Hong Kong |volume=9 |date=Spring 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; nonetheless, teachers commonly devise ad hoc tests.

==Example==
A language teacher may give the following passage to students:
{{quote|Today, I went to the ________ and bought some milk and eggs.  I knew it was going to rain, but I forgot to take my ________, and ended up getting wet on the way.}}

Students would then be required to fill in the blanks with words that would best complete the passage.  Context in language and content terms is essential in most, if not all, cloze tests.  The first blank is preceded by "the"; therefore, a [[noun]], an [[adjective]] or an [[adverb]] must follow.  However, a [[grammatical conjunction|conjunction]] follows the blank; the sentence would not be grammatically correct if anything other than a noun were in the blank.  The words "milk and eggs" are important for deciding which noun to put in the blank; "supermarket" is a possible answer; depending on the student, however, the first blank could be [[Retailing|store]], [[supermarket]], [[retailing|shop]], [[retailing|shops]], [[Market (place)|market]], or [[Grocery store|grocer]] while [[umbrella]], [[umbrella|brolly]] or [[raincoat]] fit the second.

==Assessment==
The definition of success in a given cloze test varies, depending on the broader goals behind the exercise.  Assessment may depend on whether the exercise is objective (i.e. students are given a list of words to use in a cloze) or subjective (i.e. students are to fill in a cloze with words that would make a given sentence grammatically correct).
{{quote|I saw a man lay his jacket on a puddle for a woman crossing the street.  I thought that was very ______.}}

Given the above passage, students' answers may then vary depending on their vocabulary skills and their personal opinions.  However, the placement of the blank at the end of the sentence restricts the possible words that may complete the sentence; following an adverb and finishing the sentence, the word is most likely an adjective. Romantic, [[chivalrous]] or gallant may, for example, occupy the blank, as well as [[foolishness|fool]]ish or [[camp (style)|cheesy]]. Using those answers, a teacher may ask students to reflect on the opinions drawn from the given cloze.

Recent research using eye-tracking has posited that cloze/gapfill items where a selection of words are given as options may be testing different kinds of reading skills depending on the language abilities of the participants taking the test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McCray |first1=Gareth| last2=Brunfaut |first2=Tineke| date = November 2016 |title=Investigating the Construct Measured by Banked Gap-fill Items: Evidence from Eye-tracking|journal=Language Testing| doi=10.1177/0265532216677105}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lower ability test takers are suggested to be more likely to be concentrating on the information contained in the words immediately surrounding the gap, while higher ability test takers are thought to be able to use more global information in their selection of a word to fit the gap.

==Implementation==
In addition to use in testing, cloze deletion can be used in learning, particularly [[language learning]], but also learning facts. This may be done manually – for example, by covering sections of a text with paper, or highlighting sections of text with a highlighter, then covering the line with a colored ruler in the complementary color (say, a red ruler for green highlighter) so the highlighted text disappears; this is popular in Japan, for instance {{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}. Cloze deletion can also be used as part of [[spaced repetition]] software, for example the [[SuperMemo]] and [[Anki (software)|Anki]] applications feature semi-automated creation of cloze tests.

Cloze deletion can also be applied to a [[graphic organizer]], wherein a diagram, map, grid, or image is presented and contextual clues must be used to fill in some labels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Robinson|first1=M. E.|title=Cloze Procedure and Spatial Comprehension Tests|journal=Area|date=1 January 1974|volume=6|issue=2|pages=137–142|jstor=20000851}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2468">The '''Conservatoire for Dance and Drama''' is a [[higher education]] institution in the [[United Kingdom]]. It was founded in 2001 to co-ordinate the activities of a number of affiliated schools providing higher-level vocational training in the [[performing arts]]. These are:

*[[Bristol Old Vic Theatre School]] in [[Bristol]]
*[[Central School of Ballet]] in [[London]]
*[[London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art]] (LAMDA)
*[[London Contemporary Dance School]]
*[[National Centre for Circus Arts]] in London
*[[Northern School of Contemporary Dance]] in [[Leeds]]
*[[Rambert Dance Company|Rambert School of Ballet and Contemporary Dance]]
*[[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]] (RADA) in London

Within the Conservatoire there is a balance between the art forms of dance and drama, classical and contemporary styles, as well as the only provision for circus arts within higher education.

Each of the Conservatoire schools is a separate and distinct institution that employs its own teaching staff and remains legally autonomous. At the same time, students are registered jointly with the Conservatoire and the individual school.

The Conservatoire operates through a series of committees and working groups to determine policy for the schools as a whole. The schools themselves are involved at every level of deliberation within the Conservatoire, enabling them to share knowledge and expertise for the benefit of staff, students and the wider creative world that they serve.

The Conservatoire was placed fourth in the Guardian's University Guide 2012: Specialist Institutions League Table.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/education/table/2011/may/17/universityguide Guardian University Guide 2012 - Specialist Institutions]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2011 National Student Survey, 90% of respondents said they were satisfied with their course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unistats.direct.gov.uk/nStudentSurvey.do |title=Archived copy |accessdate=February 7, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100406193647/http://unistats.direct.gov.uk/nStudentSurvey.do |archivedate=April 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="39155">'''Digital storytelling''' is a short form of [[digital media]] production that allows everyday people to share aspects of their story. The media used may include the digital equivalent of [[film technique]]s (full-motion video with sound), stills, audio only, or any of the other forms of non-physical media (material that exists only as [[electronic file]]s as opposed to actual paintings or photographs on paper, sounds stored on tape or disc, movies stored on film) which individuals can use to tell a story or present an idea.

==Introduction==
"Digital storytelling" is a relatively new term which describes the new practice of everyday people who use digital tools to tell their 'story'. Digital stories often present in compelling and emotionally engaging formats, and can be interactive.

The term "digital storytelling" can also cover a range of digital narratives (web-based stories, interactive stories, hypertexts, and narrative computer games); It is sometimes used to refer to film-making in general, and as of late, it has been used to describe advertising and promotion efforts by commercial and non-profit enterprises.

One can define digital storytelling as the process by which diverse peoples share their life stories and creative imaginings with others. This newer form of storytelling emerged with the advent of accessible media production techniques, hardware and software, including but not limited to digital cameras, digital voice recorders, [[iMovie]], [[Windows Movie Maker]] and [[Final Cut Express]]. These new technologies allow individuals to share their stories over the Internet on [[YouTube]], [[Vimeo]], compact discs, [[podcast]]s, and other electronic distribution systems.

One can think of digital storytelling as the modern extension of the ancient art of storytelling, now interwoven with digitized still and moving images and sound. Thanks to new media and digital technologies, individuals can approach storytelling from unique perspectives. Many people use elaborate non-traditional story forms, such as non-linear and interactive narratives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Moursund|first=Dave|title=Information Age Education|url=http://i-a-e.org/articles/46-feature-articles/50-digital-storytelling.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Simply put, digital stories are multimedia presentations that combine a variety of communicative elements within a narrative structure. Media may include any combination of the following: text, images, video, audio, social media elements (like tweets), or interactive elements (like maps).  

Digital stories may be used as an expressive medium within the classroom to integrate subject matter with extant knowledge and skills from across the curriculum. Students can work individually or collaboratively to produce their own digital stories. Once completed, these stories can easily be uploaded to the internet and can be made available to an international audience, depending on the topic and purpose of the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roland|first=Craig|title=Digital Stories in the Classroom|journal=School Art|date=March 2006|volume=105|series=7|issue=7|pages=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development and pioneers==

The broad definition has been used by many artists and producers to link what they do with traditions of oral storytelling and often to distinguish their work from slick or commercial projects by focusing on authorship and humanistic or emotionally provocative content. Digital Storytelling has been used by [[Ken Burns]], in the documentary ''[[The Civil War (TV series)|The Civil War]],'' cited as one of the first models of this genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sylvester|first=Ruth|author2=Wendy-lou Greenidge|title=Digital Storytelling: Extending the Potential for Struggling Writers|journal=The Reading Teacher|date=December 2009|volume=63|issue=4|pages=284–295|doi=10.1598/rt.63.4.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his documentary, Burns used first-person accounts that served to reveal the heart and emotions of this tragic event in American history, as well as narration, archival images, modern cinematography, and music (Sylvester &amp; Greenidge, 2009). Some of the other artists who have described themselves as digital storytellers are the late [[Dana Atchley]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dana|first=Atchley|title=Pioneer of Digital Storytelling|url=http://www.nextexit.com/nextexit/nextframeset.html|work=Next Exit|publisher=Dana Atchley Productions|accessdate=6 March 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110219064738/http://www.nextexit.com/nextexit/nextframeset.html|archivedate=19 February 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; his collaborator [[Joe Lambert]], [[Abbe Don]], [[Brenda Laurel]], and [[Pedro Meyer]].

The "short narrated films" definition of digital storytelling comes from a production workshop by Dana Atchley at the [[American Film Institute]] in 1993 that was adapted and refined by Joe Lambert in the mid-1990s into a method of training promoted by the San Francisco Bay Area-based StoryCenter (formerly the Center for Digital Storytelling).&lt;ref name=woletz&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Information Science Reference| isbn = 9781599048635| pages = 587–601| editors = Sigrid Kelsey and Kirk St Amant (eds.)| last = Woletz| first = Julie D.| title = Handbook of research on computer mediated communication| chapter = Digital Storytelling from Artificial Intelligence to YouTube| location = Hershey, PA| year = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At StoryCenter (formerly the Center for Digital Storytelling), digital stories are produced in intensive workshops. The product is a short film that combines a narrated piece of personal writing, photographic and other still images, and a musical soundtrack. Technology enables those without a technical background to produce works that tell a story using "moving" images and sound. The lower processing and memory requirements for using stills as compared with video, and the ease with which the so-called "Ken Burns" pan effect can be produced with video editing software, have made it easy to create good-looking short films.

Digital storytelling was integrated into [[public broadcasting]] by the [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]]'s ''Capture Wales'' project working with organisations such as Breaking Barriers. The following year a similar project was launched by the BBC in England titled ''Telling Lives''. [[Sveriges Utbildningsradio]] created ''Rum för Berättande'' (''Room for Storytelling'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ur.se/rfb/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206003423/http://www.ur.se/rfb/|title=URs Rum för Berättande - dina digitala berättelser online / digitalt berättande|archivedate=6 December 2006|work=ur.se}}&lt;/ref&gt; Netherlands Educational TV Teleac/NOT created a program with young people in different parts of the country. KQED, Rocky Mountain PBS, WETA and other public television stations in the US have developed projects. Digital storytelling is evolving from the simple narrated video to forms that are interactive and look better. These include websites and online videos created to promote causes, entertain, educate, and inform audiences.

==Components==

The most important characteristics of a digital story are that it no longer conforms to the traditional conventions of storytelling because it is capable of combining still imagery, moving imagery, sound, and text, as well as being nonlinear and contain interactive features.  The expressive capabilities of technology offers a broad base from which to integrate. It enhances the experience for both the author and audience and allows for greater interactivity.

With the arrival of new media devices like computers, digital cameras, recorders, and software, individuals may share their digital stories via the Internet, on discs, [[podcasts]], or other electronic media. Digital storytelling combines the art of storytelling with multimedia features such as photography, text, audio, voiceover, [[hypertext]] and video. Digital tools and software make it easy and convenient to create a digital story. Common software includes iMovie and Movie Maker for user-friendly options. There are other online options and free applications as well.

Educators often identify the benefit of digital storytelling as the array of technical tools from which students may select for their creative expression. Learners set out to use these tools in new ways to make meaningful content. Students learn new software, choose images, edit video, make voiceover narration, add music, create title screens, and control flow and transitions. Additionally, there is opportunity to insert interactive features for "reader" participation.  It is possible to click on imagery or text in order to choose what will happen next, cause an event to occur, or navigate to online content.

Additionally, distinctions may be drawn between [[Web 2.0]] storytelling and that of digital storytelling. Web 2.0 storytelling is said to produce a network of connections via social networking, blogging, and [[YouTube]] that transcends beyond the traditional, singular flow of digital storytelling. It tends to "aggregate large amounts of microcontent and creatively select patterns out of an almost unfathomable volume of information,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rossiter|first=M|author2=Garcia|title=Digital Storytelling: A New Player on the Narrative Field|journal=New Directions for Adult and Continuing Education|year=2010|issue=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;  therefore the bounds of Web 2.0 storytelling are not necessarily clear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alexander|first=B|author2=Levine|title=Web 2.0 Storytelling: Emergence of a New Genre|journal=EDUCAUSE Review|year=2008|volume=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another form of digital storytelling is the [[micromovie]], which is "a very short exposition lasting from a few seconds to no more than 5 minutes in length. It allows the teller to combine personal writing, photographic images or video footage, narrative, sound effects, and music. Many people, regardless of skill level, are able to tell their stories through image and sound and share those stories with others."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Digital Storytelling|url=http://i-a-e.org/articles/46-feature-articles/50-digital-storytelling.html|publisher=Information Age Education|accessdate=24 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Telling a digital story combines a narrative, whether it be fiction or non fiction, personal or general, and digital media.  Digital media includes imaging, video, sound and all other forms of media then can be portrayed visually, the most simple of digital stories can even be a power point.  The point is to convey a message through imagery, which a lot of times can be more effective then if just conveyed through sound.  In my opinion a digital story can even be told by some social media sites such as Facebook and Instagram, where you are constantly posting images accompanied by captions in order to portray the story of your life. "A story can be as short as explaining how you misplaced your keys this morning or as long as a multivolume autobiography", the wonderful thing about telling a digital story is that there really are no rules.  Like any story you want to capture, your audience it is so important when telling a digital story. So, to sell your story, as a writer, a filmmaker, a dramatist, you more often than not will ask yourself about what stories could be more compelling to you and where you might find an interesting and profound dramatic story.

==Uses in education==
The StoryCenter (formerly the Center for Digital Storytelling) model has also been adopted in education, especially in the US, sometimes as a method of building engagement and [[multimedia literacy]]. For example, the Bay Area Video Coalition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=StoryCenter|url=http://www.storycenter.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Youthworx Media Melbourne&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=YouthWorx Media|url=http://youthworx.org.au/welcome/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709005753/http://youthworx.org.au/welcome/|archivedate=2011-07-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; employ digital storytelling to engage and empower young people at risk.

===Uses in primary and secondary education===

"The idea of merging traditional storytelling with today's digital tools is spreading worldwide."  Anybody today with a computer can create a digital story simply by answering such questions as "What do you think? What do you feel?  What is important? How do we find meaning in our lives?"&lt;ref name="kompar"&gt;{{cite web | first1 = F. | last1 = Komplar | url = http://www.greenwichschools.org/page.cfm?p=4201 | title = Digital Storytelling }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most digital stories focus on a specific topic and contain a particular point of view. "These topics can range from personal tales to the recounting of historical events, from exploring life in one's own community to the search for life in other corners of the universe and every story in between."&lt;ref name="kompar" /&gt;

For primary grades the focus is related to what is being taught, a story that will relate to the students. For primary grades the story is kept under five minutes to retain attention. Vibrant pictures, age-appropriate music and narration are needed.  Narration accompanied by subtitles can also help build vocabulary. Content-related digital stories can help upper-elementary and middle-school students understand abstract or layered concepts. For example, in one 5th grade class a teacher used digital storytelling to depict the anatomy of the eye and describe its relationship to a camera. A fifth grader said, "This year I have learned that places are not just physical matter but emotional places in peoples' hearts.  iMovie has made all my thoughts and feelings come alive in an awesome movie."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first1 = T. | last1 = Banaszewski | url = http://www.infotoday.com/mmschools/jan02/banaszewski.htm | title = Digital Storytelling Finds its Place in the Classroom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These aspects of digital storytelling, pictures, music, and narration reinforce ideas and appeal to different learning types. Teachers can use it to introduce projects, themes, or any content area, and can also let their students make their own digital stories and then share them.  Teachers can create digital stories to help facilitate class discussions, as an anticipatory set for a new topic, or to help students gain a better understanding of more abstract concepts.  These stories can become an integral part of any lesson in many subject areas.  Students can also create their own digital stories and the benefits that they can receive from it can be quite plentiful.  Through the creation of these stories students are required to take ownership of the material they are presenting.  They have to analyze and synthesize information as well.  All of this supports higher level thinking. Students are able to give themselves a voice through expressing their own thoughts and ideas.

When students are able participate in the multiple steps of designing, creating and presenting their own digital stories, they can build several literacy skills. These include the following: Research skills by finding and analyzing information when documenting the story, writing skills when developing a script, and organization skills by managing the scope of the project within a time constraint. Technology skills can be gained through learning to use a variety of tools, such as digital cameras and multimedia authoring software and presentation skills through the presentation of the story to an audience. Students also gain interview, interpersonal, problem-solving and assessment skills through completing their digital story and learning to receive and give constructive criticism.&lt;ref name="Robin" /&gt;

Software such as [[iMovie]], [[Photo Story]] 3 or [[Windows Movie Maker|Movie Maker]] do all that is required.

Faculty and graduate students at the [[University of Houston]] have created a website, The Educational Uses of Digital Storytelling,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digitalstorytelling.coe.uh.edu/|title=Educational Uses of Digital Storytelling|work=uh.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; which focuses on the use of digital storytelling by teachers and their students across multiple content areas and grade levels.

The [[National Writing Project]] has a collaboration with the [[Pearson Foundation]] examining the literacy practices, the values, attitudes, beliefs and feelings, associated with their digital storytelling work with students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = National Writing Project | url = http://www.nwp.org/cs/public/print/nwp_amsession/1417 | title = Examining the Writing Processes of Digital Storytelling }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use by teachers in curriculum===

&lt;blockquote&gt;Teachers can incorporate digital storytelling into their instruction for several reasons.  Two reasons include 1) to incorporate multimedia into their curriculum and 2) Teachers can also introduce storytelling in combination with social networking in order to increase global participation, collaboration, and communication skills.  Moreover, digital storytelling is a way to incorporate and teach the twenty-first century student the twenty-first century technology skills such as information literacy, visual literacy, global awareness, communication and technology literacy.&lt;ref name="kompar" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The educational goals for teachers using digital storytelling are to generate interest, attention and motivation for students of the "digital generation" in classrooms. The use of digital storytelling as a presentation tool also appeals to the diverse learning styles of students. Digital storytelling also capitalizes on students' creative talents and allows their work to be published on the [[Internet]] for others to view and critique.&lt;ref name="Robin"&gt;{{cite conference | first1 = Bernard | last1 = Robin | url = http://faculty.coe.uh.edu/brobin/TLA/pages/03.htm | title = Digital Storytelling Hands-On Lab | booktitle = The Educational Uses of Digital Storytelling | location = Austin, TX | year = 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A handful of teachers around the world have embraced digital storytelling from a mobile platform. The use of small handheld devices allows teachers and students to create short digital stories without the need for expensive editing software. iOS devices are the norm nowadays and mobile digital storytelling applications like The Fold Game&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thefoldgame.com/|title=The Fold • unfold stories with friends|work=thefoldgame.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; have introduced an entirely new set of tools for the classroom.

With an emphasis on collaborative learning and hands on teaching, this website offer an in depth look at how to integrate 21st Century Skills with the objectives of a rigorous academic program:

===Uses in higher education===

Digital storytelling spread in higher education in the late nineties with StoryCenter (formerly the Center for Digital Storytelling) collaborating with a number of Universities while based at [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]].  StoryCenter programs with the [[New Media Consortium]] led to links to many campuses where programs in digital storytelling have grown; these include University of Maryland Baltimore,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umbc.edu/stories|title=Digital Stories @ UMBC|work=umbc.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cal State Monterey, Ohio State University, Williams College, MIT,  and the University of Wisconsin, Madison.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} The University of Colorado, Denver,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.storycenter.org/certificate.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100402063802/http://www.storycenter.org/certificate.html |archivedate=2010-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kean University, Virginia Tech, Simmons College, Swarthmore College, the University of Calgary, University of Massachusetts (Amherst), the Maricopa County Community Colleges (AZ),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maricopa.edu/curriculum/A-C/056art150.html|title=Maricopa Community Colleges  ART150     20056-99999 |work=maricopa.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others have developed programs.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}. The University of Utah offered its first class on digital storytelling (Writing 3040) in the Fall of 2010. The program has grown from 10 students the first semester to over 30 in 2011, including 5 graduate students. [[Mark Tatge|Chicago journalist Mark Tatge]] started a Digital Storytelling program at [[DePauw University]] in 2011. Students learned journalistic-style storytelling techniques and published the resulting stories on a class website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tellingdigitalstories.com|title=Digital Storytelling|work=Digital Storytelling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The distribution of digital storytelling among humanities faculty connected with the [[American Studies Crossroads Project]] was a further evolution through a combination of both personal and academic storytelling.  Starting in 2001, Rina Benmayor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hcom.csumb.edu/faculty/2tier/faculty/fulltime/rina.html|title=Division of Humanities &amp; Communication|work=csumb.edu|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511004521/http://hcom.csumb.edu/faculty/2tier/faculty/fulltime/rina.html|archivedate=2009-05-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (from California State University-Monterey Bay) hosted a StoryCenter (formerly the Center for Digital Storytelling) seminar and began using digital storytelling in her Latino/a life stories classes. Benmayor began sharing that work with faculty across the country involved in the Visible Knowledge Project&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://digitalcommons.georgetown.edu/blogs/vkp/|title=- Visible Knowledge Project|work=georgetown.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; including Georgetown University; LaGuardia Community College, CUNY; Millersville University; Vanderbilt University, and University of Wisconsin–Stout.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Out of this work emerged publications in several key academic journals{{vague|date=November 2010}}&lt;!-- name them --&gt; as well as the Digital Storytelling Multimedia Archive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://digitalcommons.georgetown.edu/projects/digitalstories/|title=Digital Stories - Introduction|work=georgetown.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ball State University]] has a masters program in digital storytelling based in the Telecommunications Department,{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} as does the University of Oslo.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uio.no/studier/emner/hf/imk/MEVIT4130/index.xml&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the [[University of Mary Washington]] launched an open online course in digital storytelling titled DS106.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ds106.us|title=Welcome to ds106|work=ds106.us}}&lt;/ref&gt; The course includes credit-seeking students at the University as well as many open, online participants from around the world.

Digital storytelling is also used as an instructional strategy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Daigle|first=Brent|author2=Sulentic-Dowell|title=Can Digital Storytelling Improve Literacy Outcomes for Students with Autism?|journal=Georgia Journal of Reading|date=Spring 2010|volume=33|issue=1|pages=25–34|url=http://www.slideshare.net/brentdaigle/georgia-journal-of-reading-4262677}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lowenthal, P.

===Uses in public health, healthcare, social services, and international development===
[[File:Getting out of gangs (8517217065).jpg|thumb|"Day Walker" was Welcome's [[nickname]] in the [[Sonke Gender Justice]] "One Man Can" campaign tackling HIV and gender-based violence.]]

The development of the [[Silence Speaks]] project&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.silencespeaks.org|title=Silence Speaks|work=Silence Speaks}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1999 under the direction of Amy Hill (who joined the StoryCenter (formerly the Center for Digital Storytelling) in 2005) led to the expansion of digital storytelling in public health. Projects developed with the [[Centers for Disease Control]], the [[Open Society Foundation]], work in gender-based violence prevention with groups in California, Texas, New York, Minnesota, and with the organization [[Sonke Gender Justice]] in South Africa, the broad use of digital storytelling with [[Foster Youth]], and finally the connection to digital storytelling to public campaigns in substance abuse prevention and community mental health programs.

Digital storytelling is being used to raise awareness of the "human" factors in healthcare.

The [http://www.patientvoices.org.uk Patient Voices programme] is the product of Pip Hardy and Tony Sumner. Established in 2003, their project provides a means for people (patients, families or healthcare workers) to tell their stories which might affect clinicians, managers and decision-makers in the healthcare arena. The Programme has worked closely with The Royal College of Nursing, The National Clinical Governance Support Team, The National Audit Office, NHS England, NHS Improving Quality, Imperial College Healthcare Trust, Kings College London, University College London and many other NHS organisations and universities. Patient Voices projects have also taken place in Canada, Australia, Norway, Hong Kong and Tanzania and the stories are used in schools of medicine and healthcare throughout the world to prompt reflection and stimulate discussion and debate.

The Patient Voices programme also provides a freely accessible resource to anyone who desires to improve the quality of health and social care. All stories, once released, are  available at The Patient Voices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patientvoices.org.uk/stories.htm|title=Patient Voices: The Patient Voices digital stories|work=patientvoices.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The stories have contributed to an understanding of patients' experiences and their role in their illness as well as to a greater understanding of the experience of people who work in healthcare.&lt;ref&gt; Haigh, C. and Hardy, P. (2010) Tell me a story: a conceptual exploration of storytelling in healthcare. Nurse Education Today&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the process of creating a Patient Voices digital story has been used to enhance the reflective skills of newly qualified nurses and medical students.&lt;ref&gt;Stacey, G., &amp; Hardy, P. (2010). Challenging the shock of reality through digital storytelling. Nurse Education in Practice&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uses in museums===
Digital storytelling is being used by many different museums.

The largest project,  ''Culture Shock!'', is currently taking place in the North East of England.&lt;ref name="Cultureshock"&gt;{{cite web | publisher = Cultureshock | url = http://www.cultureshock.org.uk/about.html | title = Cultureshock! - About }}&lt;/ref&gt; This project is using museum and gallery collections to inspire people to create their own digital stories, which are also being added to the relevant museum collections.

Another large-scale project is the work of the [[Australian Centre for the Moving Image]].

The [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington D.C. also held a series of classes to integrate arts education curriculum with digital storytelling from 2003-2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first1 = J. | last1 = Springer | first2 = S. | last2 = Kajder | first3 = J. | last3 = Borst | url = http://www.museumsandtheweb.com/mw2004/papers/springer/springer.html | title = Digital Storytelling at the National Gallery of Art }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some museums help interpret and make community history accessible. In 2007, the [[Colorado Historical Society]] collaborated with StoryCenter (formerly the Center for Digital Storytelling) to create a program, ''The Italians,'' about Italian American History.  In 2008, a group of eleven museums in Yorkshire launched ''My Yorkshire,'' a digital storytelling project.&lt;ref&gt;http://myyorkshire.org&lt;/ref&gt;  The museums work with communities to use contemporary collected oral histories alongside those from archives to interpret local history from a personal point of view, through the use of historical oral recordings and archival photos. The group has also produced help guides to creating digital stories in a museum setting.

Finished digital stories can have many uses: advertising an upcoming exhibition, preserving a short-term project, building relations with communities. They provide skills to volunteers and can be permanently displayed in galleries.

===Uses for religious training===

In 2005, the Church of Norway initiated a project wherein young people raised questions of faith and life in short biographical mini-films called 'Digital Faith Stories'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Digital faith stories|url=http://www.uv.uio.no/intermedia/english/research/projects/mediatized-stories/studies/digital-faith.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A study of this project in a congregation near Oslo found that the method of 'Digital Storytelling' could contribute to a more systematic educational method for including the lifeworld of the young in religious training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kaare|first=Birgit Hertzberg|title=Youth as Producers: Digital stories of faith and life|journal=Nordicom Review|year=2008|volume=29|issue=2|page=193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses in libraries==

A digital story station is a public space for people to create a digital story that serves to archive oral histories from the public perspective.  These oral stories may focus on a personal experience, incident, describing a place or witnessing an event.  Based on the StoryCenter (formerly the Center for Digital Storytelling) model, over 30 public libraries ranging from Northern down the coast to Southern California have a place for people to tell their own story.

Bilingual library staff work with participants to create a recording using the digital station, which can be integrated with a variety of media, including audio, video, pictures, and images. The digital storytelling station project called ''California of the Past'' is funded by a grant from the California State Library, U.S. Institute of Museum and Library Services and Technology Act, and administered in California by librarians. The Media Arts Center in San Diego facilitates this project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oakland Library|url=http://www.oaklandlibrary.org/PR/pr010509digitalstory.htm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110922052123/http://www.oaklandlibrary.org/PR/pr010509digitalstory.htm|archivedate=2011-09-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2006, San Diego has housed a story station in its downtown library. The Media Arts Center of San Diego partnered with the downtown public library to set up a story station where the public can create a three-minute video. The topics of the archived videos range from personal to historical documentaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Media Arts Center|url=http://www.mediaartscenter.org/site/c.dfLIJPOvHoE/b.3469457/k.6F12/Digital_Story_Station.htm|accessdate=June 26, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009030357/http://www.mediaartscenter.org/site/c.dfLIJPOvHoE/b.3469457/k.6F12/Digital_Story_Station.htm|archivedate=October 9, 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses in business==
With the development of marketing in the digital world is digital storytelling implemented in business.
Digital storytelling is used as a tool of [[user-generated content]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.coursera.org/learn/marketing-digital/lecture/mqL1l/digital-concept-user-generated-content-part-1/|title=Digital Concept: User Generated Content, Part1 in the Course :Marketing in Digital World |publisher= [[Coursera]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; when consumers contribute their opinion based on their own experiences about a product to promote a firm's product in the digital world.

Digital storytelling is being used by innovative startups to pitch their ideas to the potential investors and to communicate with potential customers to get feedback about the market potential of their product or service.
 
The Enterprise Center with Salem State University organized a Big Idea Video Pitch Contest&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://enterprisectr.org/big-idea-video-pitch-competition/|title=Big Idea Video Pitch Competition}}&lt;/ref&gt;  competition for students to submit a 60-second video pitch of a unique idea for a business, non-profit or social cause. People could vote once per day using the "vote now" button that is displayed in the voting section. The Digital Story that receives the most votes was awarded. Videos were judged on originality, creativity, and the clarity of message.
 
Project [[SomePitching]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.somepitching.com/|title=SomePitching}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a crowdsourced online competition for new business ideas and early stage startups to provide feedback on their product and business ideas. The freeform explanation could be a website, a short pitching video or an animation (max. 90 seconds), a slideset (max. 5 pages with font size 20+), or any other material (or combination of materials) that was short and clear for anyone to evaluate.

SomePitching used the Innopinion platform&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.innopinion.com/|title=Innopinion platform}}&lt;/ref&gt; to manage the idea rating process and the selection of winners based on the ratings from both the public and professional jury.

The intent of this competition wasn't to present the best Big Idea of the product, service, or solution only, but also to find the way, how to interpret it by Digital Story the best way from visual and narrative point of view. Because in the public jury phase, the evaluations was based on the following categories (with percent of the final score):
*Interest to buy or use the solution (20%)
*The importance of the problem the solution solves (20%)
*The value the solution brings (20%)
*The clarity and quality of the material (20%)

==Place-based digital storytelling==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2010}}
The [[Canadian Film Centre]]'s New Media Lab (formerly MediaLinx Habitat) launched a project, Murmur, out of the 2002–2003 studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.murmurtoronto.ca|title=hear you are --- [murmur] Toronto|work=murmurtoronto.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The project integrates audio interviews into cellphone-based tours. StoryCenter (formerly the Center for Digital Storytelling) created Storymapping.org in 2006 with projects in [[Mendocino, California|Mendocino]] (California), [[Houston]], [[New Orleans]], and [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama|Tuscaloosa]] (Alabama) to promote the connection between storytelling and issues of local memory and civic planning.

'''The Voice Library (TVL)'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.TheVoiceLibrary.net|title=THE VOICE LIBRARY - Digital storytelling: Instantly record and share voices for generations to come.|work=thevoicelibrary.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; launched two, ongoing, social-giving projects in 2014.

'''Education for Liberation of Siam''' ({{lang-th|กลุ่มการศึกษาเพื่อความเป็นไท}}) is a group of high school students who demand to reform [[Education in Thailand|Thai education system]] which the core members are from ''[[the Thailand Educational Revolution Alliance]]''. It was established on 2 December 2013 by [[Netiwit Chotiphatphaisal]], who is the first secretary of the group. There has been a fan page on Facebook called "The Education for Liberation of Siam" to be the intermediate for disseminating any information concerning misconducts and questionable actions made by politicians or figures of authorities that have an effect on the Thai educational community. before [[Coup d'état]] in Thailand, in January this group set the event [[anti-coup]] in front of the army camp.&lt;ref&gt;[http://prachatai.com/english/node/3826 The great national divide, in and outside the classroom]&lt;/ref&gt; Recently there was a small event, coined “Presenting flowers to show appreciation towards the military officers for not committing [[Coup d'état]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elsiam.org/เกี่ยวกับเรา/ History and Background of ELS]&lt;/ref&gt;

By sharing the same ideology that held firmly on to the belief that an [[educational reform]] in [[Thailand]] is a necessity, and the [[philosophy]] of the group believes that education should emphasize at human aspects, [[student]] and [[teacher]]s’ beliefs, respect towards humanities and the knowledge inside individuals, as in not seeing us as empty vessels to force foreign ideologies into or exercising authorities (creating rules to name one) without consulting the principals of [[logic]], [[democracy]] and [[human rights]]. In essence, this group's existence is a testament to the Thai youths' dedication and determination to oppose the use of education system as an instrument for [[propaganda]] or usage with hidden political agendas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bangkokpost.com/lite/news/421370/fall-into-line-youngsters/Fall into line, youngsters]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mann is host of the weekly radio show ''Voices from the Frontlines: Your National Movement-Building Show'' on [[KPFK]] [[Pacifica Radio]] 90.7 in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name="KPFK"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.kpfk.org/index.php/programs/154-voicesfromthefrontlines#.VFKGTIvF-sE |title= Voices From The Front Lines|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=KPFK|publisher= |access-date= February 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Eric Mann was born December 4, 1942 in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]], into a Jewish home rooted in “[[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]], working class, pro-union, pro-‘Negro’, [[Internationalist–defencist schism|internationalist]], and [[Socialism|socialist]] traditions.” Both sides of his family were Jews who fled [[Russia]] and [[Poland]] during the anti-Semitic [[pogrom]]s of the early 1900s.

His grandmother, Sarah Mandell, a garment worker and member of the [[International Ladies Garment Workers Union]], was a role model. His father, Howard Mann, was a field organizer for the [[Textile Workers Union of America]] and went south to organize black and white [[Sharecropping|sharecroppers]]. His mother, Libby, was a department store worker, an early [[feminist]], and shaped his ethical worldview. The decisive experience of his early life was antisemitism; within the context of the United States he observed virulent racism and developed a lifelong commitment to the black liberation movement.&lt;ref name= "Palestine"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Mann|first= Eric|date= September 3, 2014|title= Palestine Will Win: Solidarity from a Self-Respecting Jew|url= http://www.counterpunch.org/2014/09/03/palestine-will-win/ |journal= [[CounterPunch]] |location= |publisher= |access-date= February 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background in social movements==

Eric Mann is acknowledged as a gifted and innovative organizer who has been organizing for more than 50 years and continues his work today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Soja|first= Ed|date= 2010|title= Seeking Spatial Justice |location= University of Bristol|publisher= University of Minnesota Press|pages= 137–138|isbn= 978-0816666683}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is credited with raising organizing practice to the level of theory, generating well-known formulations to guide other organizers, a long history of involvement in the most militant, radical, revolutionary Black and Latino-led organizations, and his success in winning high profile, big-picture campaigns that have won major structural victories and illustrated his dictum "the left choice is the best choice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Mann|first= Eric|last2= Ramsey|first2= Kikanza |date= 1995|title= The Left Choice is the Best Choice|url= http://www.ahoranow.org/mannramsey_an1_part1.html |journal= AhoraNow |location= |publisher= |access-date= February 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mann wrote ''Seven Components of Transformative Organizing Theory'' and ''Playbook for Progressives: 16 Qualities of the Successful Organizer''. His theory of transformative organizing is when organizers work to radically transform the system, to transform the consciousness of the people they are organizing, and are transformed in the struggle to change the society.&lt;ref name="MannPlaybook"&gt;{{cite book |last= Mann|first= Eric|date= 2011|title= Playbook for Progressives: 16 Qualities of the Successful Organizer |location= |publisher= Beacon Press|pages= 179–188|isbn= 978-0807047354}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964 Mann graduated from Cornell University with a BA in [[Political Science]] and a minor in [[Industrial relations|Industrial and Labor Relations]]. Organizers from the [[Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee]] traveled to Cornell to recruit students into the civil rights movement and at 21 Mann went to work for the Congress of Racial Equality.&lt;ref name="MannPlaybook"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Meier |first= August |last2= Rudwick|first2= Elliott |date= 1975|title= CORE, a study in the civil rights movement, 1942-1968 |location= Chicago|publisher= University of Illinois Press|page= |isbn= 9780252005671}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Congress of Racial Equality (CORE)===
At CORE, Mann worked as field secretary for the Northeastern regional office on an anti-discrimination campaign against the [[Trailways Transportation System|Trailways Bus Company]]. Longtime Black and Latino porters had been refused job promotions; the workers were willing to lead the fight but needed CORE’s organizational support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Clark|first= Alfred E.|date= November 18, 1964|title= 2D CORE Protest Held at Bus Line| url= | newspaper= New York Times| access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign included a regional boycott of Trailways, sit-ins at Trailways terminals, a demonstration at New York’s [[Port Authority Bus Terminal]] and filing a civil rights complaint. According to ''The New York Times'': “Eric Mann, the field secretary of CORE’s Northeastern regional office, said he and Miss Joyce Ware, another officer, had organized the demonstration ‘to bring attention to our demands that the harassment of Negro and Puerto Rican employees be stopped’.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Lelyveld|first= Joseph|date= November 8, 1964|title= Trailways Buses Picketed by CORE| url= https://www.nytimes.com/1964/11/08/trailways-buses-picketed-by-core.html?_r=0 | newspaper= New York Times| access-date= February 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After six months Trailways agreed to promote Black and Puerto Rican porters to positions as ticket agents, information clerks, and bus drivers.

===Students for a Democratic Society (SDS)===
In 1965 Mann joined the Newark Community Union Project (NCUP). Mann worked with organizers Bessie and Thurman Smith, [[Tom Hayden]], 100 community members, and 10 students in door-to-door organizing in [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]]’s Black South and Central wards where they engaged low-income people in movement-building, challenging slum housing and police brutality. He worked as a public school teacher at the Peshine Avenue School and was fired for demanding that [[Stokely Carmichael]] challenge a campus speaker from the Virginia Military Academy, for refusing to enforce what he described as repressive discipline on Black children and for teaching sex education to eighth graders.&lt;ref name= "Doolittle"&gt;{{cite news |last= Doolittle|first= William|date= March 2, 1967|title= Adjourn Teacher’s Defense: Attack on ‘Backward’ Teaching Holds Crowd to 2am| url= | newspaper= Newark Evening News | access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''World Journal Tribune'' wrote that Mann put the school system on trial with 500 parents rallying to his defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= McMain|first= Nina|date= February 20, 1967|title= Teacher Claims Class Approach Led to Suspension| url= | newspaper= World Journal Tribune | access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Convinced by the Black Power movement to organize white students to support the civil rights and anti-war movements, Mann moved to [[Boston]] in 1968 to become New England Coordinator of SDS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Ripley|first= Anthony|date= June 16, 1968|title= Student Leaders Voice Radicalism| url= | newspaper= New York Times | access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the spring of 1968, Mann played a leadership role in the [[Columbia University]] student strike led by SDS and the Black Student Union, demanding that Columbia shut down its [[Institute for Defense Analysis]], and that it “integrate” the gymnasium, which only gave Blacks and Puerto Ricans limited access and a separate entrance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Keller|first= George|date= Spring 1968 |title= Six Weeks That Shook Morningside|journal= Columbia Today |location= |publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a regional coordinator for SDS, Mann organized and spoke at rallies at [[Boston University]], the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], [[Harvard University]], and other New England colleges.&lt;ref name=Harnett&gt;{{cite news |last= Hartnett|first= Ken|date= June 19, 1969 |title= Vietnam War, Racism, Poverty Used As Campus Disorder Fuel |url= | newspaper= The Progress-Index | access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; “The Columbia strike more than any other event in our history,” Mann said, “has given the radical student movement the belief that we can change this country.”&lt;ref name= "Doolittle"/&gt;

Mann was elected to SDS national committee in 1968.&lt;ref name=Harnett/&gt; He told the [[Associated Press]] that he believed in "continuous resistance" against "institutions and policies of corporate capitalism" and that SDS chapters transition from campus protests groups to community groups that would guide students as a "de facto government."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date= May 12, 1968 |title= Columbia’s Demonstration: How It Started and Grew |url= | newspaper= Florence Morning News | access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When SDS splintered into three groups in 1969, Mann adopted the [[Revolutionary Youth Movement]]’s belief that “direct action” should be used as a tactic to dismantle the group’s perceived power centers of “US imperialism”.&lt;ref name= "silver"&gt;{{cite news |last=Silver |first= Sam|date= February 13, 1975 |title= Whipping Racism |url= | newspaper= Berkeley Barb | access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mann and 20 others were arrested in September 1969 for participation in a direct action against the [[Harvard Center for International Affairs]], which the Revolutionary Youth Movement saw the center as a university-sponsored institution for [[counter-insurgency]].&lt;ref name= "Doolittle"/&gt; He was sentenced to two years in prison of which he spent 18 months in [[Billerica, Massachusetts|Billerica]], [[Deer Island (Massachusetts)|Deer Island]], and [[Massachusetts Correctional Institution – Concord|Concord State Prison]] (with 40 days in [[solitary confinement]]).&lt;ref name= "silver"/&gt; He was released in July 1971.

From 1972 to 1974 Mann was a full-time journalist, writing for ''[[The Phoenix (newspaper)|Boston After Dark]]'', the ''Boston Phoenix'', and ''[[The Boston Globe]]''. He traveled to California to cover the prison movement and political trials; a three-part series in the Boston Phoenix led to his first book published by Harper &amp; Row in 1974, ''Comrade George: An Investigation into the Life, Political Thought, and Assassination of George Jackson''. At the Boston Globe, Mann initiated the column, "Left Field Stands", in which he partnered with Boston University professor [[Howard Zinn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Zinn |first= Howard|editor-last=  |editor-first= |title= Declarations of Independence: Cross-Examining American Ideology |publisher=Perennial |date=1991 |pages= 175–176 |chapter= |isbn= 978-0060921088}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Auto Workers (UAW) Labor/Community Coalition to Keep GM Van Nuys Open===
In 1975 Mann joined the Chicano-led [[August 29th Movement]] (ATM).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Pulido |first= Laura |editor-last=  |editor-first= |title= Black, Brown, Yellow and Left: Radical Activism in Los Angeles |publisher=University of California Press |date=2006 |pages= 75–76 |chapter= |isbn= 978-0520245204}}&lt;/ref&gt; ATM merged with Chinese-American organization [[I Wor Kuen]] (IWK) and the Black Revolutionary Communist League (RCL) to form the multi-racial, multi-national [[League of Revolutionary Struggle]] (LRS) in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Elbaum |first= Max |editor-last=  |editor-first= |title= Revolution in the Air: Sixties Radicals Turn to Lenin, Mao and Che |publisher=Verso Press |date=2006 |pages= 269–275 |chapter= |isbn= 978-1859846179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mann worked on automobile assembly lines as an active member of the United Auto Workers (UAW) and ‘transformative organizer’ from 1978 to 1986, moving from the Ford assembly plant in [[San Jose Assembly Plant|Milpitas]], California, to the General Motors assembly plant in [[South Gate Assembly|South Gate]], Los Angeles, California, to the General Motors plant in Van Nuys, California.&lt;ref name= "Pena"/&gt;

With plants facing imminent closings, Mann, with Mark Masaoka, and UAW Local 645 president Pete Beltran initiated a coalition between labor, the community and the Campaign to Keep GM Van Nuys Open, which Mann chaired for ten years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Acuña |first= Rodolfo |editor-last=  |editor-first= |title= Anything But Mexican: Chicanos in Contemporary Los Angeles |publisher=Verso Press |date=1996 |pages= 193–206 |chapter= |isbn= 978-1859840313}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Five thousand workers (50 percent Latino, 15 percent black, and 15 percent women) built the coalition in Black and Latino communities, where the members lived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Tasini |first= Jonathan |date= March 23, 1984 |title= Jobs on the Line  |journal= Reader |location= |publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Threatened with a boycott, GM kept the plant open for ten years. Reverend Frank Higgins Sr. described the negotiation of the labor/community coalition with GM president [[F. James McDonald]], “For the first time they have seen a coalition form in this nation that would make them come to the table. They didn’t come to bargain; they came to deal with us as though we were children. They wound up leaving knowing they had a tiger by the tail!”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | people=Goldman, Michael (Director) | date=1986 | title=Tiger by the Tail| trans-title = | medium=Motion picture | location=Los Angeles | publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While at GM, Mann was active in the New Directions Movement, a national UAW reform group founded by Jerry Tucker in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Schwartz |first= Jim |date= July 3, 1989 |title= U.A.W.

===Environmental Justice and the Labor/Community Strategy Center (LCSC)===
In 1989 Mann, Father Luis Olivares, Reverend Frank Higgins, [[Rudy Acuña]] and other Black and Latino leaders initiated the Labor/Community Strategy Center (LCSC) as a “think tank/act tank” that would train organizers and organize labor, environmental justice, mass transportation, and civil rights campaigns.&lt;ref name= "yo mama"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Valle"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Palestine"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Turner |first= Lisa |date= December 9, 1988 |title= The Uses of Anger: Eric Mann and Rudy Acuña Want to Bring Big Business to Heel |url= | newspaper= L.A. Weekly | access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early environmental work of the LCSC, Mann's approach distinguished environmental justice organizing from the approach of the mainstream environmental movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Schulz |first= Kathryn| date= March 30, 2006 |title= Two Eco-leaders — One mainstream, One Radical — debate the movement's past and future  |journal= GRIST magazine |location= |publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mann’s 1992 book L.A.’s Lethal Air, documents how class, race, and gender were the unspoken categories of environmental injustice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Commoner |first= Barry| date= February 24, 1992 |title= Yearning to Breathe Free "L.A.’s Lethal Air", by Eric Mann  |journal= The Nation |location= |publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1993, after the [[1992 Los Angeles riots]] Mann, as principal author with the Urban Strategies Group, wrote ''Reconstructing Los Angeles and U.S. Cities from the Bottom Up.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Dutton |first= Thomas A.| date= Fall 2007 |title= Colony Over-the-Rhine  |url= http://arts.miamioh.edu/cce/papers/Colony%20Over%20the%20Rhine%202.pdf| journal= The Black Scholar |location= |publisher= |access-date= February 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That document linked transportation, the environment, and unemployment, advocating for rebuilding the manufacturing sector through “environmentally-sound production of technologies, focusing on solar electricity, non-polluting, prefabricated housing materials, electric car components, and public transportation vehicles, both buses and trains”—and called for “the social justice state not the police state.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Pulido |first= Laura |editor-last= Dear |editor-first=Michael |title= Rethinking Los Angeles |publisher=Sage Publications |date=1996 |pages= |chapter=Multiracial Organizing Among Environmental Justice Activists in Los Angeles |isbn=978-0803972872}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the LCSC’s efforts, the [[South Coast Air Quality Management District]] implemented a “right to know” statute in which community residents were given information about the chemicals they were exposed to and the corporations that were producing them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lazarovici |first= Laureen |date= December 6, 1991 |title= Air Battles: The Watchdog Wades into the Pollution Wars on Behalf of the Other LA |url= | newspaper= L.A. Weekly | access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Mann was a delegate to the U.N. World Conference Against Racism in [[Durban]], [[South Africa]] and returned to South Africa in 2002 as part of a Strategy Center NGO delegation to the [[World Summit on Sustainable Development]] in [[Johannesburg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Mann |first= Eric| date= January 2003 |title= When US Policies Scorch the Earth, What’s Left for Sustainable Development?  |url= |journal= The ARK |location= |publisher= National Organizers Alliance | access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992 Mann and the Strategy Center founded the [[Bus Riders Union (Los Angeles)|Bus Riders Union]] (BRU) with a group of Black and Latino bus riders and started organizing on the buses of Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Simon |first= Richard |date= January 16, 1996 |title= A Driven Man Keeps Heat on the MTA |url= | newspaper= Los Angeles Times | access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Working with the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] Legal Defense and Educational Fund (LDF), with Mann as chief negotiator, the BRU crafted a civil rights lawsuit based on Title VI of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] (which prevents discrimination by government agencies that receive federal funds).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Berestein |first= Leslie |date= February 3, 1995 |title= MID-WILSHIRE Bus Riders Savor Victory on Fare Hike, Vow to Maintain MTA Vigil |url= | newspaper= Los Angeles Times | access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BRU charged the [[Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] with “transit racism”—setting up a separate and unequal transit system in which Latino and Black bus riders were subject to ‘a third class bus system for Third World people’ while wealthy contractors built rail projects for a whiter, more affluent ridership. The BRU’s “billions for buses” campaign was initiated in 1992. It was initially accused of hyperbole and excessive aspirations but ended up winning $2.7 billion in improvements for 500,000 bus riders.&lt;ref name= "Palestine"/&gt;

Sit-ins, grassroots organizing, a “no seat, no fare campaign,” court orders, and negotiations with the MTA led by Mann, resulted in a ten-year civil rights [[consent decree]] committing the Los Angeles MTA to revamp and improve its bus system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Grengs |first= Joe| date= Spring 2002 |title= Community-Based Planning as a Source of Political Change: The Transit Equity Movement of Los Angeles’ Bus Riders Union |url= http://nexus.umn.edu/Courses/ce5212/Case2/Joe_Grengs_Article.pdf|journal= Journal of the American Planning Association |location= |publisher= | access-date= February 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Kelley |first= Robin DG| date= February 5, 1996 |title= Freedom Riders (The Sequel) |url= |journal= The Nation |location= |publisher= | access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BRU was designated the class representative for LA’s 500,000 bus riders (of whom 50 percent were Latino and 25 percent were Black).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Lipsitz |first= George| date= September 2004 |title= Learning From Los Angeles: Another One Rides the Bus |url= http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/american_quarterly/summary/v056/56.3lipsitz.html |journal= American Quarterly |location= |publisher= | access-date= February 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A BRU team of Eric Mann, Chris Mathis, Norma Henry, and Della Bonner worked in a “joint working group” with MTA representatives that led to replacing 2,000 dilapidated diesel buses, with 2,500 new [[compressed natural gas]] buses—the largest clean fuel bus-fleet in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hong |first= Peter |date= December 31, 1996 |title= Riding Momentum |url= | newspaper= Los Angeles Times | access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Uhrich |first= Kevin |date= February 2, 1996 |title= Uneasy Riders: The Bus Riders Union Takes on the MTA’s Separate and Unequal Transit System |url= http://articles.latimes.com/1996-12-31/local/me-14193_1_bus-riders-union | newspaper= Los Angeles Times | access-date= February 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Novotny |first= Patrick |editor-last= |editor-first= |title= Where We Live Work and Play: the Environmental Justice Movement and the Struggle for a New Environmentalism |publisher=Praeger Publishers |date=2000 |pages= 70|chapter= |isbn= 0275960269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This story is documented in the [[Haskell Wexler]] film ''Bus Riders Union''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | people=Demetrakis, Johanna and Wexler, Haskell (Directors) | date=October 2000 | title=Bus Riders’ Union | trans-title = | medium=Motion picture | location=Los Angeles | publisher= Outpost Studios}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mann attended the 2001 U.N. World Conference Against Racism held in Durban, South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Mann |first= Eric |editor-last= |editor-first= |title= Dispatches from Durban: Firsthand Commentaries on the World Conference Against Racism and Post-September 11 Movement Strategies |publisher=Frontlines Press |date=2002 |pages= 70|chapter= |isbn=978-0972126304}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his return to the U.S., the Strategy Center launched a campaign in support of the international demands for “Reparations for the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade”; this campaign was a predecessor to the Community Rights Campaign.&lt;ref name= "CRC Report"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.organizingupgrade.com/index.php/modules-menu/community-organizing/item/65-transformative-organizing-theory-panel |title= Community Rights Campaign Report, Black, Brown and Over-Policed in LA Schools: Structural Proposals to End the School-to-Prison Pipeline in the Los Angeles Unified School District and to Build a National Movement to Stop the Mass Incarceration of Black and Latino Communities |date= August 1, 2010|website=The Labor/Community Strategy Center|access-date= February 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Community Rights Campaign took up the cause of serving the transportation needs of minority students in the [[Los Angeles Unified School District]], which it linked with "transit racism". It took up the slogans of "1,000 more buses, 1,000 more schools and 1,000 fewer police", addressing what it saw as the impacts of [[Societal racism|structural racism]] on minority students in the Los Angeles Unified School District. Led by the Strategy Center’s organizer Manuel Criollo, community rights organizers built a student pass campaign that resulted in a major victory in 2005, with the LA MTA to eliminate the application process which had been limiting students’ access to low cost student passes. This laid the groundwork for the current student organizing project, “Stop the Schools as Pre-Prisons.”  This popular campaign has produced numerous reports and won significant victories—rolling back truancy tickets and charges of willful defiance, as reported in ''Black, Brown, and Overpoliced'' in 2014.&lt;ref name= "CRC Report"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Watanabe |first= Teresa |date= January 8, 2014 |title= Federal Guidelines unveiled to avoid racial bias in school discipline |url= http://articles.latimes.com/2014/jan/08/local/la-me-ln-school-discipline-20140108 | newspaper= Los Angeles Times | access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Watanabe |first= Teresa |date= May 14, 2013 |title= Zero tolerance policies adopted after Columbine lower achievement and disproportionately affect African Americans, supporters say |url= http://articles.latimes.com/2013/may/14/local/la-me-lausd-suspension-20130515 | newspaper= Los Angeles Times | access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thestrategycenter.org/project/community-rights-campaign |title= Community Rights Campaign |date= August 1, 2010|website=The Labor/Community Strategy Center|access-date= February 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2012 the work of Mann and the Strategy Center has focused on the "Fight for the Soul of the Cities" campaign. It is a political program for international urban organizing built on the Strategy Center’s Bus Riders Union and Community Rights Campaign. It opposes privatization, pollution, policing and corporate interests and proposes cities putting the Black and Latino working class as its core.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mann |first=Eric |date=May 27, 2013 |title=Fight for the Soul of the City: The Battle Over Buses in Los Angeles |url=http://www.publicadvocates.org/sites/default/files/press_releases/thenation05_09_13.pdf |journal=The Nation |location= |publisher= |access-date=February 25, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402104005/http://www.publicadvocates.org/sites/default/files/press_releases/thenation05_09_13.pdf |archivedate=April 2, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fight for the Soul of the Cities campaign has five core demands—”No Cars in LA—Stop the U.S.’s and L.A.'s War on the Planet”; “Free the U.S. 2.5 million [[Prison–industrial complex|prisoners]]—Stop the Mass Incarceration of Black and Latino Communities”; “Amnesty and Open Borders for Immigrants—Immigrant Rights are Human Rights”; “Stop U.S. Drone Attacks—Support Sovereignty and Human Rights”; “Fight for the Right to Protest and Organize—Stop the Police and Surveillance State”.

Mann led the founding of the National School for Strategic Organizing that educates and trains a multi-racial class of future leaders. The school has recruited and trained more than 100 young organizers, who are active in social movements.&lt;ref name= "yo mama"/&gt; Based on his years of organizing and 20 years of teaching organizers exchanges, Mann’s wrote Playbook for Progressives, the book that presents Mann’s theory of transformative organizing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Uhlenbeck |first= Max| date= Feb 2011 |title= How It Would Feel to be Free: A Review of Transformative Organizing |url= |journal= Left Turn Magazine |location= |publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''FOIL''' was the name for two different [[programming language]]s.

==CAI style language==
The first '''FOIL''' was a [[Computer-assisted language learning|CAI]] [[programming language|language]] developed at the [[University of Michigan]] in 1967. The acronym stood for File-Oriented Interpretive Language and it was very similar to other [[Computer-assisted language learning|CAI]] languages like [[COURSEWRITER]] and [[PILOT]]. However, it tried to make the language somewhat block-structured using whitespace which ended up making the language vaguely similar to [[BASIC]] or [[ABC (programming language)|ABC]].

===Example===
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
 :START COUNT=0
 TY Enter the number of times you want to repeat the statement:
 ACCEPT
 MAX=NUMBER.(1)
 :LOOP
 TY This loop has run #COUNT times it will terminate when it runs #MAX times
 IF COUNT&lt;MAX,
    COUNT=COUNT+1
    GO TO :LOOP
 TY Do you want to do this again?
 ACCEPT
 IF 'yes', GO TO START
 IF 'no' GO TO FINISH
 :FINISH
 TY Goodbye!
 STOP
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

==Music generation language==
The second '''FOIL''' was a music generation language for the Touché computer instrument in 1979. The Touché was a keyboard that had digital tone generation and allowed you to program software for performances. The acronym stood for Far Out Instrument Language and was succeeded by MetaFOIL and FOIL-83. The language was developed by [[David Rosenboom]] and was based on [[Forth (programming language)|Forth]].

'''Hans Brenaa''' (b Copenhagen, 9 October 1910, d Copenhagen, 14 April 1988) was a Danish dancer, teacher, and ballet director. He studied at the [[Royal Danish Ballet]] School from 1918 and joined the company in 1928; promoted to principal in 1945. He created roles in [[George Balanchine]] Legend of Joseph (1931) and in numerous ballets by Lander, including Études (1948). He produced Aurora's Wedding for the Royal Danish Ballet in 1950. After retiring from the stage in 1955 he became a producer, staging the [[Bournonville]] repertoire in Denmark and elsewhere. He also taught at the Royal Danish Ballet School in Copenhagen from 1942 and was a tireless teacher of the Bournonville style throughout Europe and America. Among the Bournonville productions he staged for the Royal Danish Ballet are The Kermesse in Bruges (1957 and 1978), La Sylphide (1967), Konservatoriet (1968), The King's Volunteers on Amager (1970), Far from Denmark (1973), and La Ventana (1979).
Brenaa made the more straightforward and ingenuous ballets dance across the stage with an infectious vitality. During the periods in which Hans Brenaa was absent from the theatre, [[Kirsten Ralov]] was the custodian of the Bournonville tradition. In 1979 she committed the Bournonville Schools to paper.

Hans Brenaa said {{cquote | I feel, I know, it's very important to shew the young people what is Bournonville. I think we do not do as much as we should do, here at the Royal Theatre, we have too much modern ballet. Of course the young people, they like that, but if we do too much, we forget Bournonville, and Bournonville is the principal thing for Denmark !.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}}}

'''Helen Betty Osborne''', or '''Betty Osborne''' (July 16, 1952 &amp;ndash; November 13, 1971), was a [[Cree]] [[Aboriginal peoples of Canada|Aboriginal]] woman from [[Norway House]] reserve who was [[kidnap]]ped and [[murder]]ed while walking down Third Street in [[The Pas]], [[Manitoba]].

== Life ==
Osborne was born in [[Norway House, Manitoba]], the eldest of many children born to Joe and Justine (née McKay) Osborne. Her ambition was to go to college and become a teacher. In order to continue her education, Osborne had to move away from the reservation since secondary school education was unavailable. She spent two years at Guy Hill Residential School&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archives.algomau.ca/main/?q=taxonomy/term/1109|title=Guy Hill Indian Residential School (The Pas, Man.) {{!}} Algoma University Archives|website=archives.algomau.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;, just outside The Pas, Manitoba, a culturally mixed town of [[European Canadians]], [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis]] and [[Cree]] people. In the fall of 1971, Osborne went to live with a European Canadian family as part of a government program in which households were reimbursed for hosting aboriginal students. This was also known as the ''[[Sixties Scoop]]''. Helen Betty Osborne attended Margaret Barbour Collegiate in The Pas.

On the evening of her death, Osborne had spent time with friends at The Northern Lite Cafe and then at the Bensons' place (where she was staying) before heading back downtown. Around midnight, Osborne's friends returned home; very little is known of Osborne's whereabouts or actions after this time. She was walking home at approximately 2:30 a.m. when she was abducted, brutally beaten, stabbed with a screwdriver over 50 times, and killed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ajic.mb.ca/volumell/chapter1.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="medium"&gt;{{citenews| url=https://medium.com/gendered-violence/what-detectives-hide-from-you-the-story-of-helen-betty-osborne-8a04aebf60bb| title=What Detectives Hide from You: The Story of Helen Betty Osborne|work=[[Medium (website)|Medium]]|first=Allison|last=Moua|date=2018-02-01|accessdate=2018-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, Kenny Gurba, a fourteen-year-old in the town, grew tired of fishing and went off looking for rabbit tracks when he discovered her unclothed body. He and his father reported the discovery to the police.

== Murder investigation ==
Police at first suspected her ex-boyfriend, Cornelius Bighetty. His name was cleared after successfully passing a lie detector test. She and Cornelius had an argument earlier in the evening at the Cambrian Hotel. During the initial days of the investigation, attention was placed on Betty's friends. Unfortunately, unacceptable recording and preserving of evidence at the Pump House (the crime scene) seriously crippled the investigation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ajic.mb.ca/volumell/chapter4.html#3]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dwayne Archie Johnston]], James Robert Paul Houghton, Lee Scott Colgan and Norman Bernard Manger, four young, Caucasian men from The Pas, were eventually implicated in her death. However, it was not until December 1987, sixteen years after her death, that any of them were convicted of the crime. It was at this time that Constable Rob Urbanoski took over the investigation and placed an ad in the local newspaper asking for witnesses to come forward. Even then, only Johnston was convicted, as Houghton had been acquitted, Colgan had received [[Immunity from prosecution|immunity]] for testifying against Houghton and Johnston, and Manger was never charged.

The [[Aboriginal Justice Implementation Commission]] conducted an investigation into concerns surrounding the length of time involved in resolving the case. According to the Commission report, Osborne's autopsy showed that "along with well over 50 stab wounds, her skull, cheekbones and palate were broken, her lungs were damaged, and one kidney was torn. Her body showed extensive bruising."&lt;ref&gt;{{citenews|url=https://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/15-canadian-stories-helen-betty-osborne-a-murder-that-resonates-50-years-later|title=15 Canadian Stories: Helen Betty Osborne, a murder that resonates nearly 50 years later|work=[[Ottawa Citizen]]|first=Blair|last=Crawford|date=2017-09-25|accessdate=2018-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission concluded that the most significant factors prolonging the case were [[racism]], sexism and indifference of white people.&lt;ref name="medium" /&gt;
The [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] officially closed the Osborne case on February 12, 1999.

== Aftermath ==
A formal apology from the Manitoba government was issued by [[Gord Mackintosh]], [[Minister of Justice and Attorney General (Manitoba)|Manitoba's Minister of Justice]], on July 14, 2000. The apology addressed the failure of the province's justice system in Osborne's case. The province created a scholarship in Osborne's name for Aboriginal women.

The small town of The Pas, Manitoba, is still affected by this event. Recently, there has been a movement by the Aboriginal community to make strides in building healthier communities and this is having a positive impact on the town and surrounding community.

As a way to remember Helen Betty Osborne, the town of Norway House named the school after her. The [[University of Winnipeg]]'s Wii Chiiwaakanak Learning Centre is located in a building named after Osborne. 

On March 26, 2008, the Osborne family again grieved as her brother was found slain in his apartment in downtown [[Winnipeg]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/winnipeg-homicide-victim-brother-of-helen-betty-osborne-1.725167|title=Winnipeg homicide victim brother of Helen Betty Osborne {{!}} CBC News|work=CBC|access-date=2018-11-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It was Winnipeg's sixth homicide of 2008.

==Cultural references==
On December 2, 2008, a [[graphic novel]] entitled 'The Life of Helen Betty Osborne' was launched by The [[Helen Betty Osborne Memorial Foundation]]. The purpose of the graphic novel was to educate youth about racism, sexism, and indifference.

Canadian Indie-Folk Rock band [[The Wooden Sky]] has produced a four-song EP entitled "The Lonesome Death of Helen Betty Osborne" and has also released a song with the same title on their full-length album "When Lost At Sea" in recognition of Osborne. Lyrics to the song depict the night of Osborne's murder.

[[Robert Munsch]], a renowned Canadian author of children's books, discussed his experience of being walked to the grave of Helen Betty Osborne one year before her perpetrators were captured. He discussed how this single incident led to a complete evolution not only in his writing as a children's author, but also in his investment into culture, the direction of his philanthropy, and especially in his philosophy of life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/player/Shows/Shows/More+Shows/ideacity/ID/2236255854/]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Osborne case is a considered an influence on Tomson Highway's ''The Rez Sisters'' (1986). The character Zhaboonigan Peterson, a mentally challenged young woman, performs a monologue in which she describes being raped by two white men with a screwdriver (Osborne was stabbed 56 times with a screwdriver). Highway attended junior high school in The Pas and graduated a year before Osborne's rape and murder.

In 1991, a [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] TV miniseries about the Osborne kidnapping and murder was made, entitled ''Conspiracy of Silence''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Conspiracy of Silence|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101070/|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Bowen was also a proficient amateur actor in his early years, appearing with a young [[Ronnie Barker]] at Oxford.

His first post was with the [[Atomic Energy Research Establishment]] (AERE), working at the [[Wantage]] Research Laboratory, then in [[Berkshire]]. His early work started an interest in [[radioisotopes]] and [[trace elements]] that he maintained throughout his working life. While at AERE, he spent several months in 1956 attending the [[British nuclear tests at Maralinga|British nuclear tests]] at [[Maralinga]] in Australia to study the environmental effects of [[radiation]].

[[File:Bowen's Kale.jpg|thumb|upright|A jar of the botanical reference material [[Bowen's Kale]], in the collection of the [[Museum of the History of Science]], [[University of Oxford]], England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.mhs.ox.ac.uk/collections/imu-search-page/record-details/?TitInventoryNo=14609&amp;querytype=field&amp;thumbnails=on&amp;irn=30882 | title=Jar of Bowen's Kale (Botanical Reference Material), Prepared by H. J. M. Bowen, 1960s | publisher=[[Museum of the History of Science]] | location=Oxford | accessdate=18 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Bowen realised that the [[calibration]] of different instruments intended to measure [[trace elements]] was an important issue that needed addressing. His solution was to produce a good supply of a material which later become known as ''[[Bowen's Kale]]''. With Peter Cawse, he grew a large amount of the plant [[kale]], then dried and crushed it into a homogeneous and stable substance that he then freely distributed to researchers around the world for years to come. This was probably the first successful example of such a standard.

In 1964, he was appointed as a lecturer in the chemistry department at the [[University of Reading]]. Later he was promoted to Reader in [[analytical chemistry]] in 1974. At Reading, Bowen undertook consultancy for [[Dunlop Rubber|Dunlop]], investigating potential uses for their products. When the ''[[Torrey Canyon]]'' oil disaster occurred in 1967, he realised that it might be possible to use foam booms to block the oil from spreading in the [[English Channel]]. His original experiments were conducted in a small bucket in his laboratory. Although not entirely successful in reality at the time due to the rough seas, this lateral thinking combined his interest in chemistry with his love of nature and has since been effectively deployed to protect ports and harbours against encroaching oil slicks. Bowen wrote a number of professional books in the field of chemistry, including two editions of ''[[Trace elements]] in [[Biochemistry]]'' (1966 and 1976).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://openlibrary.org/a/OL1636071A/H.-J.-M.-Bowen | title=H. J. M. Bowen | publisher=[[Open Library]] | accessdate=13 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1951 onwards, Bowen was a long-serving member of the [[Botanical Society of the British Isles]] (BSBI). He was meetings secretary for a period and the official recorder of plants for the counties of [[Berkshire]] and [[Dorset]], producing [[Flora (plants)|Floras]] for both counties.&lt;ref name="berkshire-flora"&gt;{{cite book| first=H.

He was also one of the leading contributors of botanical data for the ''Flora of Oxfordshire''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first1=John | last1=Killick | first2=Roy | last2=Perry | first3=Stan | last3=Woodell | authorlink3=Stan Woodell | title=Flora of Oxfordshire | publisher=Pisces Publications | year=1998 | isbn=1-874357-07-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He acted as an expert botanical guide on tours around Europe, especially [[Greece]].

Humphry Bowen donated a large collection of [[lichen]]s from Berkshire and [[Oxfordshire]] to the [[Museum of Reading]] in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.collectionsgateway.org.uk/collections/47/collection%20lichen%20general.pdf | first=David | last=Notton | title=The Bowen collection of Lichens at Reading Museum | publisher=Collections Gateway | location=UK | accessdate=14 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He established the '''Bowen Cup''' at the University of Reading in 1988, an annual prize for the student in the Department of Chemistry at the University who achieves the top marks in Part II Analytical Chemistry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.reading.ac.uk/chemistry/News/chem-news.aspx | title=Bowen Cup and RSC Analytical Chemistry Prize | work=Chemistry: News | publisher=[[University of Reading]] | location=UK | accessdate=4 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Indigo "Indi" Walker''' is a fictional character from the Australian soap opera ''[[Home and Away]]'', played by [[Samara Weaving]]. She made her first appearance during the episode broadcast on 30 July 2009. Weaving and her on-screen family initially appeared in  2009 for a guest stint, in 2010 they were written back into the serial on a permanent basis. Indi's storylines have often focused on her relationship with [[Romeo Smith]] ([[Luke Mitchell]]). Weaving announced her departure from ''Home and Away'' in July 2013 and Indi departed on 13 November 2013

==Creation and casting==
In a June 2009 interview with ''[[Digital Spy]]'', series producer [[Cameron Welsh]] said a few new cast members would arrive during the coming weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/home-and-away/news/a161625/home-and-away-character-spoilers/|title='Home and Away' character spoilers|last=Rowe|first=Darren|date=26 June 2009|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=13 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following month, it was announced that the four-strong Walker family would be introduced to ''Home and Away''. The family consists of father [[Sid Walker|Sid]] ([[Robert Mammone]]), mother [[Jody Walker|Jody]] ([[Victoria Haralabidou]]), son [[Dexter Walker|Dexter]] ([[Tom Green (Australian actor)|Tom Green]]) and daughter Indigo or "Indi".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://holysoap.five.tv/homeandaway/news/new-family-for-summer-bay-1740 |title=New family for Summer Bay|publisher=[[Holy Soap]]|accessdate=16 July 2010|date=29 July 2009|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090801155025/http://holysoap.five.tv/homeandaway/news/new-family-for-summer-bay-1740 |archivedate=1 August 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former ''[[Out of the Blue (2008 TV series)|Out of the Blue]]'' actress [[Samara Weaving]] was cast as Indigo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.whatsontv.co.uk/soaps/home-and-away/news/home-and-away-welcomes-walker-family/6523|title=Home and Away welcomes Walker family|date=29 July 2009|accessdate=16 July 2010|work=[[What's on TV]]&lt;!--|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5w0mzI26l?url=http://www.whatsontv.co.uk/soaps/home-and-away/news/home-and-away-welcomes-walker-family/6523|archivedate=25 January 2011--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; She initially appeared for five weeks in a recurring capacity.&lt;ref name="Sun"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/news/samara-weaving-gets-acting-tips-from-uncle-hugo-weaving/news-story/019eca10c5f7dc4df058c2b91b8cba18|title=Samara Weaving gets acting tips from uncle Hugo Weaving|first=Colin|last=Vickery|date=16 August 2009|publisher=[[news.com.au]]|accessdate=13 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Walker family departed at the conclusion of their storyline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://au.tv.yahoo.com/home-and-away/a/7432170/the-walker-family/#page1|title=The Walker Family have returned to Summer Bay|date=21 June 2010|publisher=[[Yahoo!7]]|accessdate=13 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weaving reprised the role the following year after producers brought back Indi, Sid and Dexter (now played by [[Charles Cottier]]) as part of the main cast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/celebrity-life/huge-weavings-as-neice-samara-takes-up-acting/news-story/0fa38889565acb9e006470bf67964b84|title=Huge Weaving's as niece Samara takes up acting|last=Clune|first=Richard|date=6 June 2010|publisher=[[news.com.au]]|accessdate=7 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weaving relocated from Canberra to Sydney for filming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://citynews.com.au/2013/weaving-fame-from-a-passionate-past/|title=Weaving fame from a passionate past|last=Edwards|first=Laura|date=23 January 2013|work=[[CityNews|Canberra CityNews]]|accessdate=13 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of her return, Weaving stated "I have loved returning to ''Home and Away'' and working with everyone again. It's a fantastic place to work and I look forward to what's next for Indi."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://au.tv.yahoo.com/home-and-away/cast/article/-/article/7448184/samara-weaving/|title=Samara Weaving|publisher=[[Yahoo!7]]|accessdate=25 January 2011|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5w0nHOiuh?url=http://au.tv.yahoo.com/home-and-away/cast/article/-/article/7448184/samara-weaving/|archivedate=25 January 2011|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weaving also admitted that her return was "easier" as she did not have to fit in filming around her studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/home-and-away/news/a223961/weaving-pleased-over-ha-comeback/|title=Weaving pleased over 'H&amp;A' comeback|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=7 June 2010|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=13 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weaving later committed herself to a long-term future with the serial stating she wanted to be around for years.&lt;ref name="f"/&gt;

==Development==
===Characterisation===
Indi was initially described as being "in turmoil", because she believes people are all liars and cheats. Indi puts up "barriers" in order to cope. Weaving found this challenging to play, as she came from a stable family.&lt;ref name="Sun"/&gt; After an accident, Indi is described as re-evaluating her life and has a new-found level of confidence and maturity.&lt;ref name="profile"&gt;{{cite web|title=Indigo Walker|url=http://au.tv.yahoo.com/home-and-away/cast/article/-/article/7448818/indigo-walker/|work=[[Yahoo!7]]|publisher=([[Seven Network]] and [[Yahoo!]])|accessdate=31 July 2010|date=June 2010&lt;!--|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5w0nM9ENj?url=http://au.tv.yahoo.com/home-and-away/cast/article/-/article/7448818/indigo-walker/|archivedate=25 January 2011--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weaving has described Indi as being very forward, not afraid to ask questions and being confident to confront others.&lt;ref name="f"&gt;{{cite web|last=Millar|first=Paul|title=Weaving: 'I'm nothing like H&amp;A Indi'|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s15/home-and-away/news/a233617/weaving-im-nothing-like-ha-indi.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi Médias|Hachette Filipacchi (UK) Ltd]]|accessdate=31 July 2010|date=26 June 2010&lt;!--|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5w0nOoxMS?url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s15/home-and-away/news/a233617/weaving-im-nothing-like-ha-indi.html|archivedate=25 January 2011--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]'' describe Indigo as being a "tortured teenager".&lt;ref name="set"&gt;{{cite web|title=Samara Weaving's chilly day on set of Home And Away|url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/entertainment/confidential/samara-weavings-chilly-day-on-set-of-home-and-away/story-e6fredq3-1225877187773|work=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]]|publisher=([[News Limited]])|accessdate=31 July 2010|date=8 June 2010&lt;!--|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5w0nRJ025?url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/entertainment/confidential/samara-weavings-chilly-day-on-set-of-home-and-away/story-e6fredq3-1225877187773|archivedate=25 January 2011--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Clune of ''[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Sunday Telegraph]]'' describes her as a typically troubled teen.&lt;ref name="hugoweaving"&gt;{{cite web|last=Richard|first=Clune|title=Huge Weaving's as niece Samara takes up acting|url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/celebrity/huge-weavings-as-neice-samara-takes-up-acting/story-e6frfmqi-1225875980845|work=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Sunday Telegraph]]|publisher=([[News Limited]])|accessdate=31 July 2010|date=6 June 2010&lt;!--|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5w0nV3yQJ?url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/celebrity/huge-weavings-as-neice-samara-takes-up-acting/story-e6frfmqi-1225875980845|archivedate=25 January 2011--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship with Romeo Smith===
From her return in 2010, one of Indi's first storylines was her relationship with [[Romeo Smith]] ([[Luke Mitchell]]). Smith hinted at a romance between the pair before Weaving had appeared on-screen again.&lt;ref name="smith"/&gt; Whilst interviewed by ''[[TV Week]]'' Smith stated: "Initially, Indi goes out of her way to see that he's okay - even though she doesn't know him, so he thinks it's nice that she cares about him. They have a lot in common, but he tells her he's not looking for romance."&lt;ref name="smith"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title='H&amp;A' actor hints at new love storyline|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s15/home-and-away/news/a228263/ha-actor-hints-at-new-love-storyline.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi Médias|Hachette Filipacchi (UK) Ltd]]|accessdate=31 July 2010|date=16 June 2010&lt;!--|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5w0nZEDW2?url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s15/home-and-away/news/a228263/ha-actor-hints-at-new-love-storyline.html|archivedate=25 January 2011--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their relationship as friends slowly develops into more. Of this Weaving stated during an interview with ''TV Week'': "It's quite funny because Indi is yelling at Romeo for reading into their friendship too much, and then he decides to just kiss her as she's half-way through telling him off! It's what she's always wanted ever since she saw him, so it's a kiss that makes her totally forget what she's saying and why she was angry at him in the first place."&lt;ref name="weavingg"/&gt; Weaving then stated the pair would not find love together quickly: "Indigo responds well to the kiss, but there's definitely still some speed bumps pending in them getting together. Indi definitely thinks that this is going to be a relationship, whereas Romeo has his doubts about it."&lt;ref name="weavingg"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title=Weaving teases 'Home and Away' love plot|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s15/home-and-away/news/a253112/weaving-teases-home-and-away-love-plot.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi Médias|Hachette Filipacchi (UK) Ltd]]|accessdate=31 July 2010|date=30 July 2010&lt;!--|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5w0nbEvoK?url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s15/home-and-away/news/a253112/weaving-teases-home-and-away-love-plot.html|archivedate=25 January 2011--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2010 it was revealed that Indi and Romeo would begin to drift apart, with Mitchell confirming this.&lt;ref name=drift&gt;{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title='Home and Away' couple 'to drift apart'|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s15/home-and-away/news/a297979/home-and-away-couple-to-drift-apart.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi Médias|Hachette Filipacchi (UK) Ltd]]|accessdate=25 January 2011|date=14 January 2011&lt;!--|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5vr2jsiS9?url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s15/home-and-away/news/a297979/home-and-away-couple-to-drift-apart.html|archivedate=19 January 2011--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fellow character [[Ruby Buckton]] ([[Rebecca Breeds]]) falls in love with Romeo, whilst breeds states that Ruby doesn't consider Indigo's feelings because she sees him as her hero.&lt;ref name=lovx&gt;{{cite web|last=Kelly|first=Kirsty|title='H&amp;A' Rebecca Breeds teases new storyline|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s15/home-and-away/news/a290521/ha-rebecca-breeds-teases-new-storyline.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi Médias|Hachette Filipacchi (UK) Ltd]]|accessdate=25 January 2011|date=29 November 2010&lt;!--|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5vr2QV7zX?url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s15/home-and-away/news/a290521/ha-rebecca-breeds-teases-new-storyline.html|archivedate=19 January 2011--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Speaking in early 2011 Weaving stated that Indi was to face relationships drama stating: "Ruby has her eyes on my boyfriend [Romeo], so that's always cause for trouble, I guess."&lt;ref name=nhyg&gt;{{cite web|last=Clarke|first=Alice|title=Shy Samara's right at home|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/sunday-heraldsun/shy-samaras-right-at-home/story-e6frf92f-1225992893127|work=[[Herald Sun]]|publisher=([[The Herald and Weekly Times]])|accessdate=25 January 2011|date=22 January 2011&lt;!--|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5w0lh9hNg?url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/sunday-heraldsun/shy-samaras-right-at-home/story-e6frf92f-1225992893127|archivedate=19 January 2011--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Executive producer [[Cameron Welsh]] promised viewers that the storyline would play a big part of the serial in 2011.&lt;ref name=prod&gt;{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title='H&amp;A' boss teases love triangle plot|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s15/home-and-away/news/a298719/ha-boss-teases-love-triangle-plot.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi Médias|Hachette Filipacchi (UK) Ltd]]|accessdate=25 January 2011|date=18 January 2011&lt;!--|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5vr2wgd9l?url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s15/home-and-away/news/a298719/ha-boss-teases-love-triangle-plot.html|archivedate=19 January 2011--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also stated: "Fans will definitely take sides on this one. Luke Mitchell, Rebecca Breeds and Samara Weaving are having a great time with this storyline, and we'll see a new side to all of them as they face the consequences of their actions."&lt;ref name=prod/&gt; After Romeo's infidelity he decides that Indigo is whom he wants to be with&lt;ref name=dghh&gt;{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title=Mitchell: 'Romeo regrets his infidelity'|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s15/home-and-away/news/a308946/mitchell-romeo-regrets-his-infidelity.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi Médias|Hachette Filipacchi (UK) Ltd]]|accessdate=15 March 2011|date=14 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruby tells Indi the truth. Weaving said that at this point Indigo's "knight in shining armour has been shattered" as she thought he was the one person who wouldn't cheat; Indigo cannot "understand the circumstances." She admitted although you would expect them to be over "she just needs time to grieve" as it leaves her "devastated". However Indi cannot forgive Ruby, Weaving said:  "I think that friendship is pretty much over now!"&lt;ref name=leavss&gt;{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title='H&amp;A' star ponders Indi, Romeo future|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s15/home-and-away/news/a309105/ha-star-ponders-indi-romeo-future.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi Médias|Hachette Filipacchi (UK) Ltd]]|accessdate=15 March 2011|date=15 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Departure===
Weaving confirmed her departure from ''Home and Away'' in July 2013. She had already filmed her final scenes as Indi.&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Scott|first=Gavin|author2=Miller, Erin|date=3–9 August 2013|title='It was time to go'|journal=[[TV Week]]|publisher=[[Bauer Media Group]]|issue=31|pages=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actress commented "Storyline-wise, it was perfect timing. Plus, with ''Home and Away'' so well-known overseas, I felt it was time to pursue other directions, and really start a more versatile career."&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt; Weaving said filming her final scenes was both sad and exciting. She also added that she would miss the cast and the Walker family.&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt;

==Storylines==

Indi agrees to return to Summer Bay along with Sid as he returns for a permanent position at the hospital. Indi moves into the Farmhouse along with her family. Indi and Nicole see each other at school, but both end their feud and start afresh. She later meets Romeo and becomes attracted to him but Indi is disappointed when he says he is not interested in romance at the moment. Indi is annoyed when Dexter reveals to Romeo the dreams she has been having about him therefore revealing her feelings for him. She is later angry with Dexter as Romeo begins to avoid her as he is not ready for a relationship, following his split with Annie. Indi becomes disheartened when Sid starts to go back to his philandering ways, but he tells Indi and Dexter that they are the most important people in his life. Indi and Romeo start to realise their feelings for each other after spending time together, but Romeo admits he is hesitant to start a relationship. They eventually kiss and start dating.

Irene then offers Indi a job at the Pier Diner and she accepts.

Indi begins to feel like she loves Romeo and when Romeo asks her about it, she confesses that she may love him a little bit. He cannot say it back because of his feelings about Annie, so he breaks up with Indi, which leaves her devastated. Romeo realises he made a mistake and gets back with Indi by telling her that he may love her a little bit too. Romeo decides he is ready to lose his virginity to her and they go upstairs, but a few minutes later Indi runs out crying without explaining to Romeo why.

Indi and Romeo get back together although they still have a turbulent relationship. They re-open the gym in the Surf Club and it seems like their life is good. However, Romeo learns that he has skin cancer and together with Sid they keep it a secret from Indi. Indi suspects something is going on, but no one will tell her. Romeo leaves the Bay, unable to tell Indi that he has cancer and with the intention of sparing her watching him die. Indi is devastated and eventually Sid tells her Romeo has cancer. Indi tries to find Romeo, but later gives up. She begins a relationship with [[Chris Harrington (Home and Away)|Chris Harrington]] ([[Johnny Ruffo]]) and carries on running the gym, employing [[Casey Braxton|Casey]] ([[Lincoln Younes]]) and [[Heath Braxton]] ([[Dan Ewing]]) to help her. Indi later discovers that Romeo has died of his illness and she is devastated and grief-stricken. She scatters his ashes with Dex and Sasha and starts having recurring dreams about him. She also ends her relationship with Chris, feeling that she is betraying Romeo's memory. After reassessing her life, Indi decides to leave the Bay to travel overseas and leaves the gym in Casey and Heath's hands. It is later mentioned that she now lives in Copenhagen, Denmark.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4287">The '''International Medical Admissions Test''' (IMAT), is an [[aptitude test]] used as part of the admissions process for some Italian universities. These universities, with the [[Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (Italy)|Italian Ministry of Education, Universities and Research]] (MIUR), offer undergraduate courses that are taught in English and open to applicants outside of Italy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.admissionstesting.org/for-institutions/about-our-tests/international-medical-admissions-test/] http://www.admissionstesting.org/for-institutions/about-our-tests/international-medical-admissions-test/ Accessed 2018-05-24&lt;/ref&gt; The test has sometimes been incorrectly referred to as the 'Italian Medical Admissions Test'.

==Participants==
The following universities offer a number of places for both home and overseas students to study [[medicine]] as part of this initiative: 
* [[University of Bari]]
* [[University of Bologna]]
* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Università_degli_Studi_della_Campania_Luigi_Vanvitelli University of Campania 'Luigi Vanvitelli']
* [[International Medical School, University of Milan|International Medical School]] at the [[University of Milan]]
* [[University of Milan-Bicocca]]
* [[University of Pavia]]
* [[Sapienza University of Rome]]
* [[University of Rome Tor Vergata]]
* [[University of Siena]]
* [[University of Turin]]
* [[University of Naples Federico II]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medschool.it/admissions/180-imat-decree/] http://www.medschool.it/admissions/180-imat-decree/ Accessed 2018-05-24&lt;/ref&gt;

Applicants for the existing courses taught in Italian currently take an Italian admissions test (developed by the Italian Commission), with the available places awarded to those scoring highest on the test. In 2011, MIUR asked [[Cambridge Assessment Admissions Testing]] to develop and deliver the English language equivalent of this Italian admissions test. The English-language version is called the International Medical Admissions Test (IMAT).

Humanitas University in Italy also uses IMAT for its Medicine and Surgery degree course. Pirogov Russian National Research Medical University (RNRMU) uses the test for admission to its bachelor's degree in Biomedicine (English taught, with the University of Turin) and Medicine and Surgery degree (English taught, with the University of Milan).

==Format and Timing==
Recently the format of the test has consisted of the following four sections:
*'''Section 1:  Logical Reasoning and General Knowledge.''' This section tests generic skills in problem-solving, understanding argument, data analysis and inference; general knowledge. It is made up of 22 multiple-choice questions.
*'''Section 2, 3 and 4: Scientific Knowledge.''' These sections test a candidate's ability to apply scientific knowledge from school science. They are made up of 38 multiple-choice questions: Biology (18 questions), Chemistry (12 questions), Physics &amp; Mathematics (8 questions).

Recently candidates have been allowed a total of 100 minutes to complete the test (60 questions). All questions had five options, of which one was correct. A correct answer was awarded 1.5 points, a blank answer 0 points and a wrong answer subtracted 0.4 points from the final score.

The format of the test is confirmed when the Italian Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR) publish the IMAT decree.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.medschool.it/admissions/180-imat-decree/ Accessed 2018-05-24&lt;/ref&gt;

IMAT takes place in April or September. The IMAT test date and registration process for [[Humanitas University]] and [[Russian National Research Medical University]] are different to the main IMAT test session and candidates should visit the [https://www.hunimed.eu/ Humanitas] and [http://rsmu.ru/home_en.html Pirogov] websites for information.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.admissionstesting.org/for-test-takers/imat/about-imat/ Accessed 2018-05-24&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The International Summer University''' is a short-term program that is held during the summer season by the [[University of Kassel]] every year. In addition to the international master programs,&lt;ref&gt;See the list of [http://cms.uni-kassel.de/unicms/index.php?id=study International Study Programmes] for details.&lt;/ref&gt; University Kassel organizes the ISU as one of its internationalization strategies.

The program of the ISU is designed for university students as well as researchers and professionals who want to learn more about [[Germans|German]] and European perspectives in [[Environmental Sciences]] and German Language &amp; Culture. Environmental science has been one of the strengths of Uni Kassel since its foundation in 1971. During the winter season the University Kassel offers the [[International Winter University (IWU) Kassel]]. The theme “sustainability” does not only cover the academic content of the ISU/IWU, but also the program design which encourages continuous learning within and outside classrooms.

==History and development of the programme==
The International Summer University started as one of the Hessen International Summer Universities that have been designed to attract international students to [[Hessen]].&lt;ref&gt;See the [http://www.isu-hessen.de Hessen International Summer Universities (ISU) homepage] for reference.&lt;/ref&gt; Established in 2001, ISU offers short-term credit-bearing academic program featuring the strengths of University Kassel in the areas of Environmental Sciences and German Language &amp; Culture studies. Apart from the academic components with specific foci, ISU is unique in its host-family program for students to experience first-hand German lifestyle. The University’s long-standing partnerships with industries in the region and experiences in university-industry [[knowledge transfer]] also bring additional benefit to ISU students by giving them opportunities to witness the application of academic knowledge in industrial settings.

Since its inception, ISU has brought some 50 international students to Kassel every year. Some of these students returned to Kassel for further studies and many of them have become the ambassadors of the University and the city of Kassel in their home countries.

The uniqueness of ISU lies in the concern for the [[sustainability]] of global environment and [[cultural heritage]]. While ISU Kassel embraces [[globalization]] and [[innovation]] in the study program, the best practices of the program have been kept – arrangement of host families – to ensure that the visiting students are fully engaged in the [[local community]] and culture during their short stay in [[Kassel]]. Students are arranged to live with carefully selected host families and to practice their classroom knowledge with tandem partners and tutors. Workshops (e.g. German dancing, cooking, sports), field trips and excursions in Kassel and neighboring areas are also organized to introduce local culture and traditions to the students. Since the program is held during the term time, ISU students also have abundant opportunities to meet local students and participate in student activities on campus.



==Program of study==
The study program of ISU includes German language courses which are designed to meet the criteria of the [[Common European Framework of Reference for Languages]] (European Language Portfolio) at the following levels: A1, B1 and C1. Students will study in small groups under the supervision of experienced teachers qualified in "'teaching German as a foreign language"'. Interactive and innovative teaching methods are characteristics of this German language course.

The seminars for the engineering module usually cover the following topics: [[adaptation to global warming|adaptation strategies to climate change]], [[earthquake engineering]], [[environmental engineering]], and integrated environmental science [[environmental science]]. Seminars for the German culture module usually covers topics such as [[history of germany]], German politics of the 20th century, [[intercultural communication]], and [[Grimm's Fairy Tales|German fairy tales]]. Students proficient in German language may choose the German-taught seminar of "Deutsche Geschichte und Politik im 20. Jahrhundert".

Students will be awarded 9 [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System|ECTS]] upon completion of the German language course and two academic seminars in either the engineering module or culture module. The seminars are taught by experienced faculty members in English and optionally in German. Students of the engineering module are arranged to visit industrial partners. Students from the cultural module are arranged to visit the museums and cultural establishments in Kassel.&lt;ref&gt;See a list of [http://www.kassel.de/englisch/culture/museums/ museums] in Kassel.&lt;/ref&gt;

==About Kassel and Uni Kassel==

The acquittal, went largely unnoticed until September 1979, when professors [[Upendra Baxi]], Raghunath Kelkar and Sarkar of [[Delhi University]] and Vasudha Dhagamwar of Pune, wrote an [[open letter]] to the Supreme Court, protesting the concept of consent in the judgment. "Consent involves submission, but the converse is not necessarily true...From the facts of case, all that is established is submission, and not consent...Is the taboo against pre-marital sex so strong as to provide a license to Indian police to rape young girls."&lt;ref name=kh132&gt;[[#Kh|Khullar, p. 132]]&lt;/ref&gt; Later in January 1980 she formed the first feminist group against rape, "Forum Against Rape", widespread protests followed and eventually [[Indian Penal Code]] was amended.&lt;ref name="Fem web"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Mind And Heart of Lotika Sarkar, Legal Radical, Friend, Feminist |url=http://news.in.msn.com/her_courage/the-mind-and-heart-of-lotika-sarkar-legal-radical-friend-feminist |date=7 March 2013 |publisher=MSN News India |accessdate=5 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=slamming&gt;{{cite news

'''Manoel Bergström Lourenço Filho''' (March 10, 1897, [[Porto Ferreira]], [[Brazil]] – August 3, 1970, [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]]) was a [[Brazil]]ian educator and education theorist.

He was heavily criticized for collaborating with [[Getúlio Vargas]]' [[Estado Novo (Brazil)|Estado Novo]]. His work reveals several facets of the intellectual educator, extremely active and concerned about the school in its social context and classroom activities. Lourenço Filho was a supporter of [[eugenics]], who believed that white people were superior to black people, concluding by means of "researches" that skin color was directly related to intellectual ability, saying that black children should study in separate rooms from white children.

==Biography==
Born in the interior of the state of [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]], being the eldest of eight children, Lourenço Filho was educated by the influence of his father, the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] Manuel Lourenço Júnior, a creative merchant and avid entrepreneur, married to the [[Swedish people|Swedish]] Ida Christina Bergström. As a boy, he was in contact with a vast literature, he became a compulsive reader.

She completed a [[Bachelor of Music]] in 1949, and then attended the [[Eastman School of Music]] in [[Rochester, New York]], studying theory with [[Allen I. McHose]] and composition with [[Wayne Barlow]]. Kasilag returned to the Philippines, and in 1953 she was appointed Dean of the Philippines Women's University College of Music and Fine Arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://etd.ohiolink.edu/send-pdf.cgi?osu1038863092|title=The Piano Compositional Style of Lucrecia Roces Kasilag|author=Salido, Caroline Besana|year=2001|accessdate=22 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After completing her studies, Kasilag made an international tour as a concert pianist, but eventually had to give up a performing career due to a congenital weakness in one hand.

Kasilag was instrumental in developing Philippine music and culture. She founded the Bayanihan Folks Arts Center for research and theatrical presentations, and was closely involved with the Bayanihan Philippine Dance Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Filipino women in nation building: a compilation|year=1984|publisher=Phoenix Pub. House|place=Quezon City|author=Beltran-Gonzalez, Michaela}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was also a former president of the [[Cultural Center of the Philippines]], head of the [[Asian Composers League]], Chairperson of the [[Philippine Society for Music Education]], and was one of the pioneers of the [[Bayanihan Dance Company]]. She is credited for having written more than 200 musical compositions, ranging from [[folksongs]] to [[opera]] to [[orchestra]]l works, and was composing up to the year before she died, at age 90.

She is particularly known for incorporating indigenous Filipino instruments into orchestral productions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5740">'''Master of Commerce''' ('''MCom''' or '''M Comm'''; sometimes ''[[Magister (degree)|Magister]] Commercii'') is a [[postgraduate]] [[master's degree]] focusing on  [[commerce]]-, [[accounting]]-, [[management]]- and [[economics]]-related subjects. Like the undergraduate [[Bachelor of Commerce]], the degree is offered in [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] nations.

The Master of Commerce typically requires two years of full-time study.  The [[Curriculum of the Waldorf schools|&lt;u&gt;curriculum&lt;/u&gt;]] is generally concentrated on one subject area, see aside, and emphasizes underlying [[theory]]. Relatedly, programs usually include a [[thesis]] component,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120125035948/http://www.wits.ac.za/academic/clm/sebs/newsebswebsite/postgraduateprogrammes/14707/masters_amp%3B_phd.html]&lt;/ref&gt; and may be exclusively research based.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100124080827/http://www.ucc.ie/en/study/postgrad/research/masters/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20131212232222/http://www.unisa.ac.za/Default.asp?Cmd=ViewContent&amp;ContentID=26738]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessandeconomics.mq.edu.au/postgraduate_coursework_programs/master_of_commerce |title=Master of Commerce |website=Macquarie University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given this structure, the MCom differs from other business and management degrees: 
*Its concentration on one area distinguishes it from generalist degrees, such as the [[MBA]]. Some universities offer the MCom in [[management|general management]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150124141612/http://www.uj.ac.za/EN/Faculties/management/departments/bit/coursesandprogrammes/Postgraduate/Documents/MCOM%20BROCHURE%20AND%20APPLICATION%20FORM.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; although this is more similar to the [[Master of Management]] than to the MBA;&lt;ref name="financialmail1"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090924015943/http://secure.financialmail.co.za/09/0918/cover/coverstory.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;  see also [[Master of Business]]. 
*As compared to specialised [[Professional degree]]s - such as the [[Master of Science in Finance]] or [[Master of Accounting]] - the MCom places more emphasis on theory; see also [[Master of Science in Management]]. 

Admission to the MCom usually requires completion of a [[Bachelor of Commerce]], or similar compatible degree; often, an [[Honours Bachelor of Commerce|"Honours degree"]] will be required.  Depending on the degree focus, a related undergraduate major and / or a fairly strong quantitative background may also be a prerequisite.  Some MCom programs admit students from science or [[engineering]] backgrounds - these programs usually require that students complete a bridging course, &lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110509063150/http://www.uj.ac.za/EN/Faculties/management/departments/infoman/coursesandprogrammes/Postgraduate/Pages/MComBusManIKM.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt; or undertake an extended program.&lt;ref name="uq"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uq.edu.au/study/program.html?acad_prog=5165 |title=Master of Commerce |website=The University of Queensland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post graduation==
Based on specialisation, MCom graduates are typically employed in fields related to their degree foci, such as financial services, marketing and project management; graduates also often work in general management and [[business consulting]]&lt;ref name="uq" /&gt; 

[[Programs of political parties in Armenia|Programs]] are sometimes structured such that graduates are eligible for membership of various [[Professional association|professional bodies]] or [[:Category:Business and finance professional associations|institutes]].&lt;ref name="uq"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ru.ac.za/economics/studying/postgraduate/mastersfinancialmarkets/ |title=Masters In Financial Markets |website=Rhodes University}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/postgraduate/plans/2011/INFSAS8404.html |title=Information Systems |website=The University of New South Wales |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110411063223/http://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/postgraduate/plans/2011/INFSAS8404.html |archivedate=2011-04-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, the institutional qualification program itself, may, in fact, be offered as an MCom degree (e.g. the Australian [[Institute of Public Accountants]] formerly offered its [[Institute of Public Accountants#IPA Program|IPA program]] as an ''MCom in Public Accounting''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://my.une.edu.au/courses/2017/courses/MCPA |title=Master of Commerce (Public Accounting) |website=The University of New England}}&lt;/ref&gt; prior to July, 2017.)

The MCom includes a research component and thus provides access to a [[doctorate]]; progressing from the MCom, a student can pursue a [[Doctor of Commerce]] (DCom), [[Doctor of Business Administration]] (DBA), or a [[PhD in management|Doctor of Philosophy]] (Ph.D) degree program.

== Notable cases ==

Welner is best known for his role and impact in a range of legal cases within the criminal and civil courts. Those of particular prominence or legal significance include:

=== ''State of New York vs. Pedro Hernandez'' – Etan Patz disappearance and murder ===
Nearly 40 years after Etan Patz disappeared, Pedro Hernandez was arrested in connection with his kidnapping and murder. Prior to Hernandez' arrest and a relative's revelations about his confessions, many authorities believed that Jose Ramos, convicted of other sex crimes, was responsible for Etan Patz' disappearance.

Prosecutors first involved Welner at the early stages after the arrest, before filing charges,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/prosecutors-paid-massive-amount-expert-etan-patz-case-article-1.3367894|title=Prosecutors paid massive amount to expert in Etan Patz case|work=NY Daily News|access-date=2018-04-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; to consider defense claims from several psychologists that Hernandez was mentally ill and intellectually disabled and falsely confessed. The defense presented multiple expert opinions in support of their claims that Hernandez was and that his confessions were unreliable. Welner interviewed Hernandez for sixteen hours,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/29/nyregion/closing-arguments-set-to-begin-in-etan-patz-murder-retrial.html|title=Closing Arguments Set to Begin in Etan Patz Murder Retrial|last=Rojas|first=Rick|date=2017|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-04-14|last2=Pastor|first2=Kate|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; interviewed police, studied confessions he had made many years earlier to a prayer group and to a fiancée, as well as to an acquaintance, and the more recent confessions he made to police interrogators in 2012, medical staff, as well as Welner himself. Welner concluded that Hernandez confessed because he felt intense guilt and that the spontaneous, voluntary confessions Hernandez made decades earlier to a prayer group and his fiancée couldn't be attributed to a psychiatric condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://psmag.com/news/depravity-standard-a-crowd-sourced-instrument-for-objectively-scoring-evil|title=Evil Genius|work=Pacific Standard|access-date=2018-04-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case proceeded to trial in 2015. Eleven jurors voted guilty, with one holdout juror remaining after nearly three weeks of deliberation. Dr. Welner testified for prosecutors at the original trial and then at the retrial, in which a jury unanimously rendered a guilty verdict to Hernandez in early 2017. Among other points, Welner told jurors it was possible Hernandez tried to minimize the damage he'd done even though he confessed. "It is not remarkable at all for a person to recall a sequence of events and to portray it in a way that is as unremarkable as possible, scrubbing away details … (creating a) much more detached relationship between that person and a victim." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/pedro-hernandez-admitted-killing-etan-patz-2-years-article-1.2172375|title=Pedro Hernandez admitted killing Etan Patz twice in 2 years|work=NY Daily News|access-date=2018-04-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''U.S. vs. Brian David Mitchell'' – Elizabeth Smart kidnappers ===

[[Brian David Mitchell]], a self-proclaimed prophet, was charged along with his wife in connection with the 2002 kidnapping of [[Elizabeth Smart]]. In a case involving the complexities of determining religious zeal from psychosis, Mitchell had been found not competent to stand trial in 2005. Mitchell then began a consistent pattern of singing hymns in court and silence to forensic examiners.&lt;ref name="NTL"&gt;{{cite web|last=Effron|first=Lauren|title=Dr. Michael Welner Describes Evaluating Elizabeth Smart's Kidnapper Brian David Mitchell|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/inside-mind-elizabeth-smarts-kidnapper/story?id=14318730|publisher=Nightline|accessdate=2014-03-21|date=2011-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent evaluations in a state hospital, with which Mitchell did not cooperate, deemed Mitchell to be unchanged – and therefore incompetent. Three years passed, and the case was contemplated for dismissal in state court &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.doctoroz.com/episode/anti-alzheimers-sleep-quiz?video_id=5713861939001|title=The Forensic Psychiatrist Behind the Elizabeth Smart Case|website=www.doctoroz.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; when federal prosecutors asked Dr. Welner to study the matter to a definitive end.&lt;ref name="NTL" /&gt; He filed a 206-page report detailing extensive new information uncovered in his evaluation,&lt;ref name="CST"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.forensicpanel.com/data/Unsorted/BDM_CST_Report-90528-1.pdf |title=Brian David Mitchell CST Report }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(1.56 MB)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and testified to his conclusions that Mitchell was competent. At a 2010 hearing, [[Dale A. Kimball|Justice Dale Kimball]] ruled Mitchell was competent to proceed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://forensicpanel.com/data/Unsorted/Memorandum_Decision.pdf |title=Brian David Mitchell Memorandum Decision }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(552 KB)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Judge: Kidnapping Suspect Competent for Trial|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/35648245/ns/us_news-crime_and_courts/t/judge-kidnapping-suspect-competent-trial/#.UyxRqPldV8F|publisher=Associated Press|accessdate=2014-03-21|date=2010-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case proceeded to trial, where Dr. Welner testified that Mitchell was a pedophile, a sadist, personality disordered, and not legally insane.&lt;ref name="NTL" /&gt;  His testimony drew particular attention to cognitive distortions as they differ from delusions,&lt;ref name="CST" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Reavy|first=Pat|title=Brian David Mitchell stalked other girls, doctor says|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/705349810/Brian-David-Mitchell-stalked-other-girls-doctor-says.html?pg=all|publisher=Deseret News|accessdate=2014-03-21|date=2009-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and culture-specific beliefs of [[Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints|fundamentalist LDS adherents]].

=== ''State vs. Byran Uyesugi - Mass murder'' ===
{{main|Xerox murders}}
Byran Uyesugi, a forty-year-old Xerox service technician, killed seven of his co-workers on November 2, 1999 in the worst mass murder case in the history of Hawaii. Uyesugi began working for Xerox in 1984. He began making unfounded accusations of harassment and product tampering against fellow repairmen, who had great difficulty placating his anger. Coworkers told Welner, who interviewed family, friends, neighbors, co-workers, and Uyesugi prior to trial, that as early as 1995, Uyesugi was openly speaking of carrying out a mass shooting at the workplace were he ever to be fired.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Inside_the_Minds_of_Mass_Murderers.html?id=Cre7qsswRiwC|title=Inside the Minds of Mass Murderers: Why They Kill|last=Ramsland|first=Katherine M.|date=2005|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=9780275984755|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the period leading up to the shooting, Xerox management increasingly committed to phasing out the copier that Uyesugi had been servicing. He resisted learning the new machine, fearing that he could not keep up with its technical demands. After working around his refusal to train on the new machine, Uyesugi's manager insisted on November 1, 1999 that he would begin training the next day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archives.starbulletin.com/2000/06/14/special/story9.html|title=Honolulu Star-Bulletin Hawaii News|website=archives.starbulletin.com|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead, Uyesugi came to work the next day and shot his colleagues dead, narrowly missing an eighth victim, after calmly waiting by the water fountain, with "butterflies in his stomach," he later told Welner, as he contemplated the shooting before going through with it.&lt;ref name="Honolulu Star-Bulletin Hawaii News"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archives.starbulletin.com/2000/06/02/news/story2.html|title=Honolulu Star-Bulletin Hawaii News|website=archives.starbulletin.com|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Uyesugi pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity and claimed that he feared his colleagues were conspiring to have him fired. Welner testified for the prosecution that although Mr. Uyesugi was in his opinion a schizophrenic, "He knew what he was doing was wrong, and he simply did not care.&lt;ref name="Honolulu Star-Bulletin Hawaii News"/&gt;  The jury found him sane and guilty of seven murders and one attempted murder after only 75 minutes of deliberation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.deseretnews.com/article/766107/Xerox-repairman-convicted-in-killings.html|title=Xerox repairman convicted in killings|date=2000-06-14|work=DeseretNews.com|access-date=2018-04-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;   He received a sentence of life without chance of parole.  In 2002, the State of Hawaii Supreme Court upheld Uyesugi's conviction.

Dr. Welner has consulted to courts or examined perpetrators on numerous mass shooting and attempted mass shooting cases, including Colorado's James Holmes,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.denverpost.com/2015/07/10/a-guide-to-mental-health-professionals-who-saw-theater-shooting-gunman/|title=A guide to mental health professionals who saw theater shooting gunman|date=2015-07-10|work=The Denver Post|access-date=2018-04-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; NBC gunman William Tager,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=mcq495|title=Welner: Showing VT Killer's Video Is 'Social Catastrophe'|date=2007-05-02|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn53wwjiC5w|accessdate=2018-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; corrections officer George Banks, who killed 13,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/pa-supreme-court/1227285.html|title=FindLaw's Supreme Court of Pennsylvania case and opinions.|website=Findlaw|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tavares Calloway,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://law.justia.com/cases/florida/supreme-court/2017/sc10-2170.html|title=Calloway v.

=== ''State of Alabama vs. Harvey Updyke'' – Sports and culture ===

Harvey Updyke, a fanatic of [[Alabama Crimson Tide]] football, was charged with poisoning the iconic trees at Auburn University's [[Auburn Tigers|Toomer's Corner]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Toomer's Corner Oaks coming down|url=http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/8907860/famed-toomer-corner-oaks-auburn-coming-final-roll|publisher=ESPN.com News Services|accessdate=2014-03-21|date=2013-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Updyke's actions, which inspired an ESPN 30 for 30 documentary film, became a symbol of the intensity of the [[Iron Bowl|Alabama-Auburn football rivalry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Scott|first=David|title=Front &amp; Center: Paul Finebaum on ESPN Films' 'Roll Tide/War Eagle'|url=http://frontrow.espn.go.com/2011/11/front-center-paul-finebaum-on-espn-films-roll-tidewar-eagle/|publisher=ESPN Front Row|accessdate=2014-03-21|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Updyke continued to exhibit bizarre behavior after his original arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Culpepper|first=Ben|title=Harvey Updyke arrested in Louisiana home improvement store on terrorizing charge|url=http://www.abc3340.com/story/19628459/harvey-updyke-arrested-in-louisiana-home-improvement-store-on-terrorizing-charge|publisher=ABC 3340|accessdate=2014-03-21|date=2012-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''State of Texas vs. Andrea Yates -'' Insanity and child killing ===
[[Andrea Yates]] was prosecuted by the State of Texas for the murder of her five children. She claimed legal insanity as a defense at trial for the murder of three of her children. In 2002, Yates was convicted of murder, and sentenced her to life imprisonment. In 2005, the conviction was overturned because the prosecution witness, Park Dietz, falsely testified that Yates' behavior and defense was identical to an earlier episode of [[Law &amp; Order]]. There was no such episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Williams|first=Pete|title=Convictions Overturned for Mom Who Drowned 5 Kids|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/6794098/ns/us_news-crime_and_courts/t/convictions-overturned-mom-who-drowned-kids/#.UyxXwYWNPlx|publisher=NBC News|date=2005-06-01|accessdate=2014-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In anticipation of the 2006 retrial for the drowning of her five children, prosecutors asked Welner to assess her diagnosis and Yates' appreciation of the wrong of killing her children at the time of the crime, the criteria for legal insanity. In the videotaped interview with Welner, Yates admitted that she had actually determined to kill the children two months earlier and at a time of relative stability, and was waiting for her first occasion to be alone with them. She knew she would otherwise be stopped. Welner diagnosed Yates with [[psychotic depression]], but concluded that she elected to kill her children because she was overwhelmed, timed with the departure of her mother-in-law that left her as sole caregiver of her five children. Welner also discovered that Andrea Yates locked up the family dog, which was usually free to run around in the house, before drowning the children. Welner included this as one of 68 examples of Yates' appreciation of the wrong of killing her children at the time it happened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Setrakian|first=Lara|title=Despite 'Not Guilty' Verdict, Doctor Who Examined Yates Is Unconvinced|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/LegalCenter/story?id=2245394&amp;page=1&amp;singlePage=true|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=2014-03-21|date=2006-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With Welner's examination still ongoing, prosecutors called Deitz at the second trial to testify once again that Yates appreciated that her actions were wrong; Dietz also testified that Yates was not grossly psychotic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lezon|first=Dale|title=Yates not 'grossly psychotic' before drownings, Dietz testifies|url=http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/Yates-not-grossly-psychotic-before-drownings-1875541.php|publisher=Houston Chronicle|accessdate=2014-03-14|date=2006-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Welner later testified that while Yates was psychotic, she appreciated the wrong of her actions. The presiding judge neither allowed the jury access to Welner's 124-page report, nor allowed him to testify to the contents of his interviews of 23 witnesses, including Ms. Yates' husband. Prosecutors did not show Welner's 14-hour interview to the jury, nor introduce psychological testing evidence showing her lack of remorse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Welner|first=Michael|title=What the Yates Jury Never Knew|url=http://www.chron.com/opinion/outlook/article/What-the-Yates-jury-never-knew-1847217.php|publisher=Houston Chronicle|accessdate=2014-03-21|date=2006-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The jury, which had been culled from a group that was already familiar with heavy news reporting in the earlier trial&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Hare|first=Peggy|title=Yates jurors asked to set aside preconceptions|url=http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/Yates-jurors-asked-to-set-aside-preconceptions-1859692.php|publisher=Houston Chronicle|accessdate=2014-03-21|date=2006-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and without individual [[voir dire]] for their feelings about the case, found Yates not guilty by reason of insanity.

In the aftermath, Yates jurors who later acknowledged personal experiences with mental illness championed the verdict as a landmark.

=== ''State of Louisiana vs. Damon Thibodeaux -'' Disputed confessions ===
Damon Thibodeaux confessed in 1996 to raping and murdering a cousin, Crystal Champagne. He was tried, convicted, and sentenced to death.&lt;ref name="DT1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nola.com/crime/index.ssf/2012/09/marrero_man_whose_false_confes.html|title=Angola death row inmate who gave false confession released after 15 years|last=Purpura|first=Paul|date=2012-09-28|website=|publisher=The Times-Picayune|accessdate=2014-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although appeals upheld the verdict, defense attorneys raised numerous points to the [[Jefferson Parish, Louisiana|Jefferson Parish]] District Attorney to argue that Thibodeaux was innocent. No DNA evidence was dispositive and no other perpetrator had been identified beyond speculation. Given the importance of Thibodeaux' confession to the evidence against Thibodeaux, District Attorney Paul Connick asked Welner to review the available evidence, the circumstances of the interrogation and the setting in which it occurred, as well as Thibodeaux' vulnerabilities, to inform their decision-making about the case. Dr. Welner also conducted a videotaped interview of Thibodeaux, in a case that featured considerable cooperation by prosecution and defense with his protocol.&lt;ref name="DT2"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.jpda.us/documents/Thibodeaux.pdf |title=Damon Thibodeaux Press Release }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(16 KB)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Welner concluded the [[False confession|confession was false]] because physical findings grossly contradicted Thibodeaux' statements. He issued a 53-page opinion addressing the causes and factors leading to the false confession. These included the defendant's profound guilt over the fate of his cousin, being confronted with his failed polygraph, and police convincing him that what Thibodeaux himself conceded were false statements in the interrogation clinched his guilt and made continuing denials hopeless.&lt;ref name="DT2" /&gt; Informed of Dr. Welner's conclusions, the District Attorney moved to vacate the confession and Thibodeaux was released.&lt;ref name="DT1" /&gt; The murder of Crystal Champagne remains under investigation.

Welner has examined numerous other notable and cited disputed confession cases in North American courts,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://law.justia.com/cases/new-jersey/appellate-division-published/2002/a5275-00-opn.html|title=STATE OF NEW JERSEY v.

=== ''State of Kansas vs. Cheever - ''Death penalty ===

Scott Cheever was arrested for the shooting death of Sheriff Matthew Samuels at a rural [[methamphetamine]] lab. When defense attorneys raised the prospect of a psychiatric defense, federal prosecutors retained Welner to examine criminal responsibility claims, ranging from psychiatric diagnoses to the effects of methamphetamine.  Welner's review of the case included a videotaped interview of the defendant,&lt;ref name="SCO"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/13pdf/12-609_g314.pdf |title=Supreme Court Opinion Kansas v Cheever }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(100 KB)}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which they discussed the events of the crime, his movements before and during the shooting of Samuels, and what was influencing his decisions.

Defense attorneys at trial instead offered a defense of methamphetamine intoxication. Welner, whose own inquiry had studied what Cheever took, when he took it, and amphetamine's effects on his behavior, and testified in rebuttal that Cheever was making decisions and controlling his actions from moment to moment before the crime, despite having used methamphetamine a short time earlier. Cheever was convicted and eventually sentenced to death.&lt;ref name="SCO2"&gt;{{cite web|title=STATE of Kansas, Appellee, v. Scott D. CHEEVER, Appellant|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/ks-supreme-court/1610344.html|publisher=Supreme Court of Kansas|date=2012-08-24|accessdate=2014-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Kansas Supreme Court]] reversed the verdict, and ruled that the trial court erred in permitting prosecutors to call Welner as a witness because an intoxication defense was not a mental health defense. In the court's opinion, the error required a new trial because Welner's testimony included a detailed accounting of Cheever's actions in his own words, and was, "extensive and devastating."&lt;ref name="SCO2" /&gt; In a rare outcome, The [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] then unanimously reversed the Kansas Supreme Court, ruling that an intoxication defense, when raised by a defendant, waived a [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] protection, that prosecutors had a right to call Welner in rebuttal, and reinstated the verdict and death sentence.&lt;ref name="SCO" /&gt;

In addition to Cheever, Dr. Welner has examined defendants and/or testified in numerous other notable or court cited death penalty cases,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://localtvwreg.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/2443016-0-481.pdf|title=IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF TENNESSEE WESTERN DIVISION|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://law.justia.com/cases/new-jersey/supreme-court/2004/a-31-01-opn.html|title=State v.

=== ''U.S. vs. Omar Khadr -'' Terrorism and War ===
{{main|Omar Khadr}}
Khadr, a fifteen-year-old Canadian expatriate living in Afghanistan, was charged with the killing of U.S. Army medic Christopher Speer at an al-Qaeda safe house in Khost. Khadr was captured by American forces on July 27, 2002 and held first in Bagram, Afghanistan and then at [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]]. He was prosecuted through a [[Military justice|U.S. military tribunal]].&lt;ref name="TFPOK"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.forensicpanel.com/data/Unsorted/Dr_Welner_Report_Omar_Khadr_Case.pdf |title=US vs Omar Khadr Report }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(3.33 MB)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] engaged Welner to examine claims by Khadr that his confessions were coerced, or alternatively, that he was too immature to withstand interrogation. Welner was also asked to assess issues of criminal responsibility. Welner reviewed the available interrogations and secured access to intelligence sources and Khadr's classified file. He interviewed guards, interrogators, medical personnel, Guantanamo camp commanders, intelligence data analysts, and then, Khadr himself.&lt;ref name="PLC"&gt;{{cite web|last=Gollum|first=Mark|title=Omar Khadr: Peace-loving Canadian or al-Qaeda royalty?|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/omar-khadr-peace-loving-canadian-or-al-qaeda-royalty-1.1184472|publisher=CBC News|accessdate=2014-03-28|date=2012-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Welner concluded Khadr's confessions were the product of his being confronted with later-recovered video of his assembling bombs, and video of his asserting that he wanted to kill many Americans. Welner's inquiry also led him to repudiate defense claims that Khadr had been tortured.&lt;ref name="TFPOK" /&gt; He came to the impression of Khadr as worldly beyond his years, from the range of his travel and interactions to experiences with other languages and translating al-Qaeda meetings for his father, to evasion techniques he manifested in interrogations with senior intelligence personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Levant|first=Ezra|title=Omar Was Not A Child Soldier|url=http://www.ezralevant.com/omar_was_not_a_child_soldier/|publisher=The Source|accessdate=2014-03-28|date=2012-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a lengthy proceeding, Judge [[Patrick Parrish]] admitted Omar Khadr's confessions into evidence, ruling, "there isn't credible evidence the accused was ever tortured…even using a liberal interpretation considering the accused's age."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defense.gov/news/D94-D111.pdf |title=US vs Omar Khadr Suppression Motions |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101101225658/http://www.defense.gov/news/D94-D111.pdf |archivedate=2010-11-01 |df= }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(2.63 MB)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Military prosecutors also asked Welner to assess Mr. Khadr's likelihood of recidivism into radical jihadism upon release, for presentation at a sentencing hearing. Welner based his assessment on clinical data, research on deradicalization programs, research on incarcerated Muslim youth, and statistics of recidivism of Guantanamo detainees.&lt;ref name="DRTT"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/Dr_Michael_Welner%27s_testimony_at_Omar_Khadr%27s_sentencing_hearing.PDF |title=Dr. Welner Testimony Transcript }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(1.56 MB)}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the sentencing proceeding, Welner testified that Mr. Khadr was a high risk of recidivism into dangerous jihadist activities, although he did not expect him to be directly violent.&lt;ref name="DRTT" /&gt; Factors contributing to Welner's opinion included Khadr's continued strong enmeshment with his jihadist family and its legacy, the international and financial infrastructure available to him, his stature among other detainees, among other factors.&lt;ref name="PLC" /&gt; Referencing Mr. Khadr's evolution at Guantanamo, Welner's testimony noted that then 24-year-old Khadr had been "marinating in jihad," and how the deputy camp commander characterized him as a "rock star" to other inmates who engaged him to lead them.&lt;ref name="DRTT" /&gt; The jury sentenced Khadr to 40 years in prison, though preempted by a pre-existing plea bargain, he was to serve no more than eight additional years at either Guantanamo Bay or in a Canadian prison. A defense appeal directed at Welner's testimony was summarily dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Joscelyn|first=Thomas|title=A False Martyr|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/false-martyr_557737.html?page=1|accessdate=2014-03-28|date=2011-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011, Canadian Public Safety Minister [[Vic Toews]] wrote to U.S. Defense Secretary [[Leon Panetta]], asserting that Canada would need to review the sealed tape of Welner's interview in order to consider repatriating Khadr.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Perkel|first=Colin|title='I'm OK around anybody,' Omar Khadr says in interview sought by Vic Toews|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/07/24/im-ok-around-anybody-omar-khadr-says-in-interview-sought-by-vic-toews/|publisher=Canadian Press|accessdate=2014-03-28|date=2012-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; After reviewing the interviews, Canada repatriated Khadr on September 29, 2012 under heavy pressure from the United States government. However, Canada echoed Welner's previously stated concerns about the nature of Khadr's dangerousness and placed him in a maximum security facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Freeze|first=Colin|title=Minister's Khadr comments threaten parole system's integrity: lawyers|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/ministers-khadr-comments-threaten-parole-systems-integrity-lawyers/article4580000/|publisher=The Globe and Mail|accessdate=2014-03-28|date=2012-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2013, Khadr's prison transfer application, considered independently of Welner's involvement, was denied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Omar Khadr won't be moved from federal prison after judge denies application|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2013/10/18/omar-khadr-wont-be-moved-from-federal-prison-after-judge-denies-application/|publisher=Canadian Press|accessdate=2014-03-28|date=2013-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Over the objections of the Canadian government of Prime Minister Stephen Harper, a judge released Khadr to the community in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/08/world/americas/omar-khadr-canada-guantanamo-detainee-released-on-bail.html|title=Omar Khadr, Former Guantánamo Detainee, Is Released on Bail in Canada|last=Austen|first=Ian|date=2015-05-07|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-04-15|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Forensic Panel ==

Welner is the founder and chairman of [[The Forensic Panel]], a multi-specialty forensic practice which employs [[peer-review]] of its forensic consultation. The objective of peer review, pursuant to the protocols established by The Forensic Panel, is intended to minimize examiner bias by subjecting forensic assessment to the formal evaluation and scrutiny of peers, who critique the diligence, objectivity, and adherence to standards of the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ramsland |first=Katherine |url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/criminal_mind/forensics/welner/index.html |title=Profile of Dr. Michael Welner forensic psychiatrist - The Crime Library — Forensic Psychiatry — Crime Library on |publisher=Trutv.com |accessdate=2012-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Forensic Panel is composed of over thirty practitioner members who provide forensic consultation in psychiatry, psychology, neuroradiology, emergency and critical care medicine, nursing, toxicology, and pathology.

== The Depravity Standard and other research ==

=== Depravity Standard/Depravity Scale ===

Welner has pioneered research to operationalize an evidence-based approach for courts and juries charged with defining "heinous", "depraved", and "evil" crimes in sentencing determinations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tucker|first=Neely|title=Giving Evil the Eye|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/22/AR2007072201247.html|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=2014-03-20|date=2007-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Depravity Standard contains twenty-five components of intent, actions, [[victimology]], and attitudes associated with criminal offenses.&lt;ref name="CCM"&gt;{{cite book|last=Welner|first=Michael|title=Crime classification manual: A standard system for investigating and classifying violent crime|year=2013|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|pages=55–72|author2=Douglas, J. |author3=Burgess, A. W. |author4=Burgess, A. G. |author5=Ressler, R. K. |chapter=Classifying crimes by severity: From aggravators to depravity}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of the research is to promote an emphasis on gathering evidence as opposed to relying on impressionistic arguments, and to establish a methodology that prevents bias based on race, diagnosis, prognosis, or history, socioeconomics, or other personal factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Welner|first=Michael|title=Response to Simon: Legal Relevance Demands That Evil Be Defined and Standardized|journal= The Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law|year=2003|volume=31|pages=417–421}}&lt;/ref&gt; The application of the Depravity Standard distinguishes particular crimes by their severity relative to other comparable crimes. For example, the Depravity Standard's application will enable the distinction of the worst of murder relative to other murders, the worst of assault relative to other assaults, and the worst of [[white collar crime]]s and thefts relative to comparable crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The justice and therapeutic promise of science-based research on criminal evil|journal=The Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law|year=2009|volume=37|issue=4|pages=442–449}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Depravity Standard is an inventory of evidence relating to the different stages of a crime – before, during, and after. The Depravity Scale, an internet-based series of surveys and a component of the Depravity Standard research,&lt;ref name="deps"&gt;{{cite web|last=Welner|first=Michael|title=The Depravity Standard|url=https://depravitystandard.org/faq.html|accessdate=2014-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; has established public consensus for what aspects of a crime are most heinous.&lt;ref name="CCM" /&gt; The Depravity Standard, informed in part by this data, by higher court decisions, and by evidence from [[Adjudication|adjudicated cases]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Depravity Standard: A Call for Large Scale Homicide Case Research|newspaper=Empire State Prosecutor|year=2010|pages=14–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; is not a psychological evaluation or test.&lt;ref name="deps" /&gt; Rather, it is an inventory to guide inexperienced jurors on what qualities of a crime may distinguish its severity if they believe them to be present.&lt;ref name="CCM" /&gt;

=== CIEEO (Clinical Inventory of the Everyday Extreme and Outrageous) ===
The Depravity Standard research has inspired Dr. Welner's research into the CIEEO (Clinical Inventory of the Everyday Extreme and Outrageous), a 14-item inventory of non-criminal everyday evil reflecting a range of an actor's intent and effects on a victim.&lt;ref name="CDLB"&gt;{{cite news|last=Robinson|first=David|title=Seeking a Better, Fairer Method of Determining Parental Rights|newspaper=Chicago Daily Law Bulletin|date=2013-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the Depravity Standard, the CIEEO is being developed to apply in clinical and screening settings to flag behaviors that warrant treatment or other intervention in order to prevent consequences at home, workplace, or community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Welner|first=M|author2=Mastellon, T.|title=Defining Evil Through the Depravity Standard and the Clinicians Inventory for the Everyday Extreme and Outrageous|journal=Journal of Social Sciences|year=2011|volume=1|issue=8|pages=41–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CIEEO is inspired by the goals of vigilance for child abuse – namely, detection and identification being the first step toward intervention and treatment of the worst of behaviors.&lt;ref name="CDLB" /&gt;

=== Perpetrators of drug-facilitated sex assault ===

Welner researched and developed the typology for classifying drug-facilitated sex assaulters. Such offenders are distinguished by setting, be it workplace, in social interactions, or doctors. The offenders found in each of these separate settings exhibit particular qualities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=LeBeau|first=M.|title=The Perpetrators and Their Modus Operandi|year=2001|publisher=Academic Press|location=London|chapter=Drug-Facilitated Sexual Assault}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public policy ==
Welner was a key contributor a range of proposals within landmark mental health reform legislation that passed the United States Congress in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/local/region/2017/04/24/Tim-Murphy-mental-health-Trump-Elinore-McCance-Katz-SAMHSA-secretary/stories/201704250068|title=Rep.

Welner was under serious consideration by the Trump Administration as Assistant Secretary of Mental Health in the Department of Health and Human Services,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mdedge.com/clinicalpsychiatrynews/article/136628/addiction-medicine/white-house-pick-mental-health-czar-causes|title=White House pick for mental health czar causes stir|website=www.mdedge.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; a position created to direct mental health and substance abuse policy in the United States.

'''Nari Gandhi''' (1934–1993) was an Indian architect known for his highly innovative works in [[organic architecture]].&lt;ref name="Lang2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jon T.

==Early life and education==
Nariman (Nari) Dossabhai Gandhi was born in 1934 in [[Surat]] to a [[Zoroastrian]] [[Parsi]] family from Bombay. He was one of the six children with three brothers and two sisters.

Nari completed his schooling DDFF at [[St. Xavier's High School, Fort]], [[Mumbai]], and studied architecture at [[Sir J. J. College of Architecture]], [[Mumbai]] for five years in the early 1950s. He travelled to US to apprentice with [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] at the [[Taliesin (studio)|Taliesin]] and spent five years there. After Wright's death in 1959, Nari left Taliesin and studied pottery at the [[Kent State University]] for two years.

==Career==
He also briefly worked for the American Architect [[Warren Weber]]. He was a good friend of [[Bruce Goff]]. Nari returned to [[India]] in the early 1960s. He taught at the [[M.S. University]], [[Baroda]] and at the [[Academy of Architecture]], [[Mumbai]] for a brief period. He passionately worked on as many as 30 projects over a period of as many years. He died in a tragic accident in 1993 near Khopoli, while he was on the way to one of his project sites at Kolgaon.

While working in India, Nari continued to work on Wright's ideology of [[organic architecture]] and further developed his own unique style with a subtle influence of local climate and culture. He ceaselessly continued to work on Wright's idea of 'flowing space'. Nari worked without an office and rarely made any drawings for any of his projects. Nari spent a lot of time on his sites and worked closely with the craftsmen and often participated in the construction process himself.

==Personal life==

Nari lead a very simple life. He never married and had no children. He was a very religious man and believed in the [[Zoroastrian]] way of life. The simplicity of his life reflected in his work. The strong creative force behind his work also shaped the way he looked at ordinary things in life. In the later years of his life, Nari was greatly influenced by the ideas of the Indian philosopher [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]]. He used to say that ''Silence'' and ''Void'' are synonyms of the word ''God''.

Insensitivity towards (his) work would disturb him. He used to get very angry at times. He often had disputes with his clients when they disregarded his ideas and works. He used to also get angry with the workers on his sites at times. It is very unfortunate that this aspect of Nari's life has attained more significance in people's minds rather than his creative genius.

His work reflected more intrinsic element of nature, which affected consciously

==At Taliesin==

During the five years that Nari spent at Taliesin, he would spend more time working with his hands on stone and wood rather than on the drawing board. Nari left Taliesin with an ever-lasting mark, which is known amongst fellow apprentices as ''Nari's rock''. The rock remembered after him is actually a huge boulder, which Nari had pulled down from a nearby hill and which, still stands today near the entrance to the Taliesin.

==Architectural style==

Nariman Dossabhai Gandhi's ideologies and works were in sharp contrast to the mainstream architectural thinking. His works display a distinctive '''organic''' character. They appear to have evolved as a response to the context, remaining strongly rooted to the site and being very well connected to the surroundings. Nari's works display highly skilled craftsmanship and structural ingenuity. He has stacked earthen pots to construct arches out of them and built stairs out of brick arches. Throughout his works you see extraordinary use of stone, brick, wood, glass and leather.

Nari Gandhi rejected conventional ideas and paradigms and introduced his own through his work. Through his work, he started 'rethinking' about standardised practices and set up his own. When you visit any one of his houses, you will notice an evident 're-thinking' of the arrangement of various functions within the house. Each building designed by Nari is as an example of unconventional thinking in architecture.

He created built spaces that remained forever connected to their un-built surroundings allowing sunlight and wind to interact with the inside and animate the space with time. Each house is a series of dialogues between the built and the un-built.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14826">The '''National Council of Teachers of English''' ('''NCTE''') is a United States professional organization dedicated to "improving the teaching and learning of [[English language|English]] and the [[language arts]] at all levels of [[education]]. Since 1911, NCTE has provided a forum for the profession, an array of opportunities for [[teacher]]s to continue their professional growth throughout their careers, and a framework for cooperation to deal with issues that affect the teaching of English." In addition, the NCTE describes its mission as follows:

{{quote|The Council promotes the development of [[literacy]], the use of [[language]] to construct personal and public worlds and to achieve full participation in society, through the learning and teaching of English and the related arts and sciences of language.}}

The NCTE is involved in publishing journals (''College Composition and Communication'' and ''[[College English]]'') and books that address the concerns of English language arts educators. Since the 1970s, it has issued annual [[Doublespeak Award]]s and [[Orwell Award]]s. It also issues the NCTE Intellectual Freedom Award &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncte.org/awards/slate|title=NCTE National Intellectual Freedom Award - NCTE|author=|date=|website=ncte.org|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
As stated on the official NCTE website, The National Council of Teachers of English was founded in 1911 by a group of educators in Chicago, Illinois, known as the English Round Table of the National Education Association.This group wanted to create a professional response to changing needs and values regarding education, particularly English language education. The impetus for this early effort was a concern that school curricula were becoming too narrow and were incapable of addressing the needs of an increasingly diverse student population. A special committee was formed to address these issues.Since this time the NCTE has provided a forum for English teaching professionals to continue their professional growth throughout their careers, in addition to providing a framework for cooperative action pertaining to issues that affect the instruction of English.

These concerned educators at first set themselves a limited task: to explore the problems arising from a rigid, narrowly defined approach to English language instruction. Soon, however, it became apparent that more was needed, and that only a national professional organization would have the ability to affect policy decisions. By 1919 the original investigatory committee had grown large enough to become such an organization. Because of its open-door policy regarding membership, the NCTE from the first maintained a divisional structure, with separate groups representing elementary, secondary, and postsecondary educators.

Over the next several decades the organization continued to grow. By 1948 it was clear that the simple divisions based on grade level were inadequate, and the [[Conference on College Composition and Communication|Conference on College Composition and Communication (CCCC)]] was formed to address the special needs of communication and composition teachers at the university and community college level. This reliance on committee organization proved to be extremely useful, for it permitted interested groups to concentrate their focus on particular issues or trends. Membership grew dramatically in the second half of the twentieth century, and over the years new committees were formed, leading to the five-conference structure in place at the beginning of the twenty-first century. A notable past president was [[Lou L. LaBrant]] in 1954 who lived to be 103 and taught for 70 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Guthrie|first=James W.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pq0YAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=National+Council+of+Teachers+of+English+Lou+L.+LaBrant&amp;dq=National+Council+of+Teachers+of+English+Lou+L.+LaBrant&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwAWoVChMIpZSPpPvhxwIVUBeSCh0udAMX|title=Encyclopedia of Education: IEA-Lowenfeld|date=2002|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|Macmillan Publishers]]|accessdate=September 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hunnicutt|first1=Clarence William|last2=Iverson|first2=William J.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X_o0AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=National+Council+of+Teachers+of+English+Lou+L.+LaBrant&amp;dq=National+Council+of+Teachers+of+English+Lou+L.+LaBrant&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAGoVChMIpZSPpPvhxwIVUBeSCh0udAMX|title=Research in the three R's|date=1958|publisher=[[Harper (publisher)|Harper]]|accessdate=September 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
NCTE offers its members opportunities to grow professionally by interacting with colleagues in all facets of English teaching. Individuals belong to any of four broad Sections of membership – Elementary,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncte.org/elem |title=Elementary Section |publisher=Ncte.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Middle,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncte.org/middle |title=Welcome to the Middle Level Section of NCTE - your home in the middle! |publisher=Ncte.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondary&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncte.org/second |title=HIGH SCHOOL MATTERS: The Secondary Section |publisher=Ncte.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; or College.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncte.org/college |title=Welcome to the College Section |publisher=Ncte.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; They may also join other groups centered on various teaching specialties within English, each with its own journal, meetings, and projects.
Major interest groups, called Conferences, serve teachers of college writing and rhetoric; teacher educators in higher education and in-service posts; teachers with an interest in whole language; and English department chairs, K-12 supervisors, and other English instruction leaders. Assemblies are informal special interest groups, ranging in focus from computers in English to research, which meet at NCTE conventions. A notable example of this last sort of group is the Children's Literature Assembly, which publishes the ''Journal of Children's Literature''.

Commissions monitor and report on trends and issues in the teaching of language, composition, literature, reading, and media. Nearly 50 committees and task forces carry out projects on issues and topics in the teaching of English, among them testing and evaluation, censorship, instructional technology, response to literature, teacher preparation and certification, and English in urban schools.

&lt;rev&gt;In addition to commissions, standing committees are charged with focusing on issues and/or areas of continued concern that effects the English language area of study. There are three standing committees; the committee against censorship, the committee on diversity and inclusivity, and the committee on global citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncte.org/volunteer/groups|title=Serve - NCTE|author=|date=|website=ncte.org|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Committee Against Censorship===
The committee against censorship's charge is "to solicit and receive reports of censorship incidents from NCTE members, constituent groups, and sources outside the Council; to serve as a resource on current patterns of censorship; to continue to raise awareness of censorship issues; to serve as an advisory committee to NCTE Headquarters considering the kinds of support and services that an Intellectual Freedom/Anti-Censorship Center could provide; to promote policies for literature adoption that allay the possibility of censorship; to help NCTE develop rationales for the teaching of controversial texts, and to develop a white paper that further explores students' right to write and all of its implications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncte.org/volunteer/groups/censorshipcom|title=Standing Committee Against Censorship - NCTE|author=|date=|website=ncte.org|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;" This committee also is charged with determining the winner of the NCTE's

===The Committee on Diversity and Inclusivity===
The committee on diversity and inclusivity's charge is to "advise NCTE on efforts to foster diversity and inclusivity among members and potential members, including (but not restricted to) in terms of race, ethnicity, sex and gender identity, age, economic status, physical ability, and teaching circumstances.Work in concert with the Executive Committee and Executive Director on specific assignments that ensure equity and diversity within membership.Identify strategies to employ the resources and values of diversity and inclusivity to advance NCTE’s mission for all members, our students, and our constituencies.Provide annual or biannual analyses of the effectiveness of NCTE diversity and inclusivity initiatives (programs, awards, events, etc.), and to make recommendations based on that analysis. Identify existing research or resources that can support a diverse NCTE membership and their professional needs. Identify gaps or opportunities that might be met with new research or resources."

===The Committee on Global Citizenship===
The committee on global citizenship's charge is "to promote interest and knowledge of global connections and issues across the Council, including convention sessions, publications, social media, and Council projects;To promote discussions of the learning needs of students in schools and colleges who come from global contexts and of instructional strategies for teachers of these students; To encourage discussions of the teaching of English and world Englishes in global contexts as well as in North American schools and colleges with increasingly globally diverse students;To provide awareness of literacy education in global contexts in order to provide a mutual exchange of pedagogical ideas and issues;To encourage the integration of global and international literature and of strategies for intercultural understanding within schools and colleges; and to engage the Council in an exploration of the changing needs of literacy teaching and learning in an increasingly global society and as members of a broader global community." &lt;/rev&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncte.org/volunteer/groups/globalcitizenship|title=Standing Committee on Global Citizenship|author=|date=|website=www.ncte.org|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 


==Strategic governance==
In November 2003, the NCTE Executive Committee adopted a new model of policy-oriented style of governance for the Council. They have studied the meaning and ramifications of the following issues for the organization as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncte.org/about/gov ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070821234652/http://www.ncte.org/about/gov |date=August 21, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political activities==
The NCTE is engaged in a variety of political issues affecting English Education and does so primarily through SLATE: Steering Committee on Social and Political Concerns. According to the NCTE website, SLATE attempts to "influence public attitudes and policy decisions affecting the teaching of English language arts at local, state, and national levels; to implement and publicize the policies adopted by NCTE. As part of its political action function, SLATE will serve as NCTE's intellectual freedom network."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncte.org/volunteer/groups/ncteslatecom |title=NCTE/SLATE Steering Committee on Social and Political Concerns |publisher=Ncte.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===NCTE and SLATE===
NCTE and Slate are involved in many political issues, some of which include:
* NCLB&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncte.org/pubs/chron/highlights/127781.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008044313/http://www.ncte.org/pubs/chron/highlights/127781.htm |date=October 8, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Banned Books&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ala.org/ala/oif/bannedbooksweek/bannedbooksweek.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011001753/http://www.ala.org/ala/oif/bannedbooksweek/bannedbooksweek.htm |date=October 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Striving Readers Act&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncte.org/about/issues/action/alerts/126953.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713084122/http://www.ncte.org/about/issues/action/alerts/126953.htm |date=July 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The Education Reporter, the newspaper of the [[Eagle Forum]], published an article entitled "English Standards Provoke Criticism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eagleforum.org/educate/1996/june96/english.html |title=June Education Reporter - English Standards Provoke Criticism |publisher=Eagleforum.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group criticized NCTE for publishing a set of "12 Standards" that 'do not direct educators to teach phonics, spelling, grammar, or punctuation, or provide any suggestions for reading lists.' The article includes information concerning the Department of Education, which initially gave $1 million to support the project but stopped their funding in March 1994. Additionally, The Eagle Forum scoffs at NCTE’s new definitions that were set into place, as well as their philosophy that supports non-conventional spelling, bilingual education, non-traditional English use, and multiculturalism. Some of the words with updated definitions include: Standard English, text, language, reading, and literacy. Furthermore, The Eagle Forum is also quoted in saying that, “despite an enormous commitment of time and federal money, the standards have so far had no discernible impact upon student learning.”

==Present and future==
The NCTE currently has a reported 35,000 members and subscribers in the United States and internationally. This membership is composed of teachers and supervisors of English programs ranging from elementary, middle, and secondary schools to faculty in college and university English departments as well as teacher educators, local and state agency English specialists, and other professionals in directly related fields. Sponsoring over 120 regional, state, provincial, local, and student affiliates within the United States, Canada, and Asian countries, the NCTE continues it rapid annual growth.

The '''National Standard Examination in Chemistry''' or NSEC is an examination in chemistry for higher secondary school students in [[India]], usually conducted in the end of November. The examination is organized by the Indian Association of Chemistry Teachers. Over 30,000 students, mainly from Standard 12, sit for this examination.

==Eligibility==

The examination is intended for students in 12th standard, though 11th standard students are also allowed to take the examination.

==Importance==

The top 1% students from this examination are selected to sit for the [[Indian National Chemistry Olympiad]]. The theory part of the examination is held in the last week of January. The top 30 among all students are selected for the Orientation-Cum-Selection-Camp (OCSC), Chemistry.

==Format==

The NSEC comprises only [[multiple choice question]]s. The questions include physical chemistry, organic chemistry, and inorganic chemistry. The stress on biochemistry is more in the NSEC than in the typical school syllabi.

==Fee==

As per the new revised norms the fee for the NSEC is about Rs. 100. Application for this examination is typically handled through the school/college to which the student is affiliated.

{{no footnotes|date=February 2013}}

The '''Open Archives Initiative''' ('''OAI''') is an organization to develop and apply technical interoperability standards for archives to share catalog information (metadata).&lt;ref name=AboutOAI&gt;[http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/OAI-organization.php Open Archives Initiative -&gt; About OAI]&lt;/ref&gt; It attempts to build a "low-barrier [[interoperability]] framework" for archives ([[institutional repository|institutional repositories]]) containing digital content ([[digital library|digital libraries]]). It allows people (service providers) to harvest [[metadata]] (from data providers). This metadata is used to provide "value-added services", often by combining different data sets.

OAI has been involved in developing a technological framework and interoperability [[standardization|standards]] for enhancing access to [[eprint]] archives, which make [[academia|scholarly]] communications like [[academic journal]]s available, associated with the [[open access]] [[publishing]] movement. The relevant technology and standards are applicable beyond scholarly publishing.

The OAI technical infrastructure, specified in the [[Protocol for Metadata Harvesting]] (OAI-PMH) version 2.0, defines a mechanism for data providers to expose their metadata. This [[protocol (computing)|protocol]] mandates that individual archives map their metadata to the [[Dublin Core]], a common metadata set for this purpose.

'''Pre-kindergarten''' (also called '''Pre-K''' or '''PK''') is a [[classroom]]-based [[preschool]] program for children below the age of five in the United States, Canada and Turkey (when [[kindergarten]] starts).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://education.seattlepi.com/age-can-start-prek-georgia-5429.html|title=At What Age Can You Start Pre-K in Georgia?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y1C0DAAAQBAJ|title=The SAGE Encyclopedia of Contemporary Early Childhood Education|first1=Donna|last1=Couchenour|first2=J. Kent|last2=Chrisman|date=16 August 2016|publisher=SAGE Publications|via=Google Books|isbn=9781483340340}}{{pn|date=October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may be delivered through a [[preschool]] or within a reception year in [[elementary school (United States)|elementary school]]. Pre-kindergartens play an important role in [[early childhood education]]. They have existed in the US since 1922, normally run by private organizations. The U.S. [[Head Start (program)|Head Start]] program, the country's first federally funded pre-kindergarten program, was founded in 1967. This attempts to prepare children (especially disadvantaged children) to succeed in school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Andrews |first1=Shirley P. |last2=Slate |first2=John R. |title=Public and private prekindergarten programs: A comparison of student readiness |journal=Educational Research Quarterly |date=March 2002 |volume=25 |issue=3 |pages=59–73 |url=https://search.proquest.com/openview/1fd9d6a85609b39e6644082a990af151/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=48020 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
The term "pre-kindergarten" is often used interchangeably with the concepts of "nursery care" and "[[child care]]"; however, these other early childhood settings focus their goal on substitutionary care for children while their legal parents/guardians are absent as opposed to pre-K's focus on skill building. They could involve academic training, or they could involve solely [[socialization|socializing]] activities.

Pre-kindergartens, though, differentiate themselves by ''equally'' focusing on building a child's (1) [[social]] development, (2) physical development, (3) [[emotion]]al development, and (4) [[cognitive]] development. They commonly follow a set of organization-created teaching standards in shaping curriculum and instructional activities/goals. The term "[[preschool]]" more accurately approximates the name "pre-kindergarten", for both focus on harvesting the same four child development areas in subject-directed fashion. The term "[[preschool]]" often refers to such schools that are owned and operated as private or [[parochial school]]s. Pre-kindergartens refer to such school classrooms that function within a [[Public school (government funded)|public school]] under the supervision of a public school administrator and funded completely by state or federally allocated funds, and private donations.

Most school districts describe Pre-Kindergarten as "an early learning program to prepare children for kindergarten who are identified as at risk." Pre-kindergarten provides learning to children who are 4 years old on or before September 1. Preschool provides learning to children who are 3 years olds on or before September 1. Most programs are 3 hours but extended day is offered in some schools.

"K-2" is often (and controversially) used interchangeably with "pre-kindergarten". Although [[early childhood education]] experts criticize the use of the term as a way to rationalize utilizing a kindergarten model and teaching kindergarten skills in pre-kindergarten classes, public school districts continue to incorporate the term as a way to integrate pre-kindergarten into the stable of [[accountability]] under the [[No Child Left Behind Act]].

==Qualification==
To qualify for '''free''' pre-kindergarten in some states the child generally must be:

* 4 years old (some districts offer programs for 3-year-olds) on or before September 1 and meet one of the following criteria:
** Limited English Proficiency. (This refers to the United States only. In Canada and other countries, free pre-kindergarten programs may not necessarily be available to parents or may have different criteria for admission.)
** Economically Disadvantaged. Students qualifying as economically disadvantaged must meet the federal income eligibility guidelines. To qualify a family must have income below about 175% of the Annual Federal Poverty Guidelines (U.S.A.). 
** Homeless.
** The child of a parent in the military or injured or killed while actively serving in the military. Appropriate U.S. Department of Defense identification or documentation must be provided.
** In or have been in the conservatorship of the state. Appropriate documentation from the Department of Family and Protective Services must be provided.

"Pre-Kindergarten" may have different meanings in other countries. In India, this is also known as Nursery in Kindergartens such as Applekids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.applekidsblr.com|title=Apple Kids website|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Programs ==

In 2013 Alabama, Michigan, Minnesota, and the city of San Antonio enacted or expanded Pre-K programs. In New York City new mayor [[Bill de Blasio]] was elected on a pledge of Pre-K for all city children. A poll conducted in July for an early education nonprofit advocate found that 60 percent of registered Republicans and 84 percent of Democrats supported expanding public preschool by raising the federal [[tobacco tax]].&lt;ref name=nyt1402&gt;{{cite news |title=Preschool Push Moving Ahead in Many States |first1=Richard |last1=Pérez-Peña |first2=Motoko |last2=Rich |date=February 3, 2014 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/04/us/push-for-preschool-becomes-a-bipartisan-cause-outside-washington.html |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=October 14, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Funding for Pre-K has proven a substantial obstacle to creating and expanding programs. The issue produced multiple approaches. Several governors targeted existing budgets. San Antonio increased sales taxes, while Virginia and Maine look to gambling. In Oregon, currently 20% of kids have access to publicly funded Pre-K of any kind, and a 2016 campaign is working to fully fund Pre-K to 12 education, for all kids whose parents want them to have the option of Pre-K.&lt;ref name=nyt1402/&gt;&lt;ref name=ffos1&gt;{{cite news|title=Fully Fund Oregon Schools|url=https://fullyfundoregonschools.org|accessdate=March 6, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216015435/http://fullyfundoregonschools.org/|archivedate=February 16, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2012 review by the National Institute for Early Education Research at Rutgers University identified Oklahoma, Georgia and West Virginia as among the leaders in public program quality and fraction of enrolled children. Florida had the highest enrollment in 2012 — almost four-fifths of all four-year-olds. About 84 percent were in private, religion-based or family centers. That state's preschool programs did not fare well on quality measures. Other states with more than 50 percent enrollment included Wisconsin, Iowa, Texas and Vermont.&lt;ref name=nyt1402/&gt;

Florida was one of the first states to establish free prekindergarten. The programs offer a jump start to young children on their education. The program is open to all 4 and 5-year-olds who reside in Florida and have birthdays before September 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; of the current school year. Voluntary Pre-Kindergarten gives each child an opportunity to perform better in school and in the future. A strong emphasis is put on literacy skills, accountability, and smaller class sizes. These high-quality programs aid children in becoming strong readers and improving social and developmental skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.floridaearlylearning.com/vpk.aspx|title=VPK {{!}} Florida Office of Early Learning|website=www.floridaearlylearning.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several different programs for parents to choose from. They differentiate in class size, instructional hours, and teacher credentials. Florida VPK programs also offer specialized instruction for children with special needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.floridaearlylearning.com/vpk.aspx|title=VPK {{!}} Florida Office of Early Learning|website=www.floridaearlylearning.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benefits of the VPK program include better behavior, preparation for Kindergarten, and a promoted love of learning for children. The skills children learn at home are enhanced by Voluntary Pre-Kindergarten.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.floridaearlylearning.com/vpk/types_of_VPK_programs.aspx|title=Types of VPK Programs {{!}} Florida Office of Early Learning|website=www.floridaearlylearning.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact ==
A 2018 study in the ''[[Journal of Public Economics]]'' found in Italy that pre-kindergarten "increased mothers' participation in the labor market and lowered the reservation wage of the unemployed, thus increasing their likelihood of finding a job" but "did not affect children's cognitive development, irrespective of their family background."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jpubeco.2017.12.012 |title=Early kindergarten, maternal labor supply and children's outcomes: Evidence from Italy |journal=Journal of Public Economics |volume=158 |pages=79–102 |year=2018 |last1=Carta |first1=Francesca |last2=Rizzica |first2=Lucia }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several different programs for parents to choose from. They differentiate in class size, instructional hours, and teacher credentials. Select programs also offer specialized instruction for children with special needs. Benefits of the VPK program include better behavior, preparation for Kindergarten, and a promoted love of learning for children. The skills children learn at home are enhanced by placement in Pre-Kindergarten.

== Children of immigrants ==

The US Census Bureau forecast that the foreign born population in the United States would make up 19% of the US population by 2060 (up from 13% in 2014).&lt;ref&gt;Colby, S. &amp; Ortman, J. (2014). Projections of the Size and Composition of the U.S. Population: 2014 to 2060. Current Population Reports, P25-1143. U.S. Census Bureau.&lt;/ref&gt; Children of immigrant families face special challenges.

=== Cultural values and childcare options ===
Children of immigrants represent the fastest growing US population. Asians and Latinos are the two largest racial groups. Like all families, immigrants have choices when pursuing childcare options. Cultural differences influence childcare choices, such as attitudes towards early academic development. These differences help explain differences in childcare selection. Compared to Latino immigrant groups, Asians are more likely than Latinos to enroll their children in pre-kindergarten programs due to the inclusion of academics.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.childyouth.2013.04.024 |title=Predictors of early care and education type among preschool-aged children in immigrant families: The role of region of origin and characteristics of the immigrant experience |journal=Children and Youth Services Review |volume=35 |issue=9 |pages=1342–1355 |year=2013 |last1=Miller |first1=Portia |last2=Votruba-Drzal |first2=Elizabeth |last3=Coley |first3=Rebekah Levine }}&lt;/ref&gt; The focus of pre-academic, school readiness is important to Asian parents. Latino immigrant parents by contrast generally opt for more informal childcare options, such as parental, relative or non-relative in-home care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1747-7379.2007.00060.x |title=Early Child Care and the School Readiness of Children from Mexican Immigrant Families |journal=International Migration Review |volume=41 |pages=152–181 |year=2018 |last1=Crosnoe |first1=Robert }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is due in part to the opinion that academic skills are taught through formal instruction after children enter primary school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0002716208322765 |title=Disparities in the Educational Success of Immigrants: An Assessment of the Immigrant Effect for Asians and Latinos |journal=The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science |volume=620 |pages=90–114 |year=2008 |last1=Harris |first1=Angel L. |last2=Jamison |first2=Kenneth M. |last3=Trujillo |first3=Monica H. }}&lt;/ref&gt; While Latino families value the acquisition of academic skills, the in-home childcare choice is a reflection of the importance of cultural and linguistic values and traditional family dynamics. Parents with limited English proficiency are more likely to choose parental or in-home care instead of pre-kindergarten programs.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

=== Barriers ===
According to information from the [[Survey of Income and Program Participation]] (SIPP) and the [[Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development|National Institute of Child Health and Human Development]] (NICHD), low-income immigrant families are less likely to use center-based childcare, such as pre-kindergarten, than children of non-immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.0020-7985.2004.00274.x |title=The Child Care Arrangements of Preschool-Age Children in Immigrant Families in the United States |journal=International Migration |volume=42 |pages=65–87 |year=2004 |last1=Brandon |first1=Peter D. }}&lt;/ref&gt; While some Latino families prefer in-home childcare, many report wanting to enroll their children in a pre-kindergarten program. Interviews with immigrant mothers revealed common motivations for seeking pre-kindergarten placements for their children, including maternal employment, opportunity to learn English and social and emotional development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ecresq.2013.02.001 |title=Low-income African and Latina immigrant mothers' selection of early childhood care and education (ECCE): Considering the complexity of cultural and structural influences |journal=Early Childhood Research Quarterly |volume=28 |issue=3 |pages=470–486 |year=2013 |last1=Vesely |first1=Colleen K. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Obstacles immigrant mothers reported facing included high cost, long wait-lists, a need to provide documentation (especially for illegal aliens and those who lacked English-language proficiency) and a lack of information regarding eligibility for subsidized programs. On average, immigrants tend to experience higher poverty rates due to low wages, less education and a lack of English proficiency.

=== Benefits ===
While all children would benefit from pre-kindergarten and early childhood education, immigrant children, particularly those from lower socio-economic households, stand to benefit the most. Studies indicate that first and second generation immigrants lag behind children of non-immigrant families in cognitive and language skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ecresq.2009.07.004 |title=The early developmental competencies and school readiness of low-income, immigrant children: Influences of generation, race/ethnicity, and national origins |journal=Early Childhood Research Quarterly |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=411–431 |year=2009 |last1=De Feyter |first1=Jessica Johnson |last2=Winsler |first2=Adam }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pre-K's focus on cognitive, social, emotional and physical development would address these skills and reduce the inequalities in school readiness between children from immigrant and non-immigrant families. Educators must be sensitive to sensitivities of immigrant groups regarding the acquisition of the English language versus their native-language. Pre-K could help children build either or both skills. For most US students, English fluency is essential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/fare.12171 |title=Family Socioeconomic Status, Immigration, and Children's Transitions into School |journal=Family Relations |volume=65 |pages=73–84 |year=2016 |last1=Crosnoe |first1=Robert |last2=Ansari |first2=Arya }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
{{refimprove section|date=October 2016}}
The mortarboard is generally believed by scholars{{who|date=October 2015}} to have developed from the [[biretta]], a similar-looking hat worn by [[Roman Catholic]] (and [[High Church]] [[Anglican]]) clergy. The biretta itself may have been a development of the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] ''pileus quadratus'', a type of skullcap with superposed square and tump (meaning small mound). A reinvention of this type of cap is known as the [[Bishop Andrewes cap]].&lt;ref name=goff&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goff|first1=Philip|title=University of London Academic Dress|date=1999|publisher=University of London Press|location=London|isbn=0718716086}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|22–23}} The Italian ''biretta'' is a word derived from the [[Medieval Latin]] ''birretum'' from the [[Late Latin]] ''[[wikt:birrus|birrus]]'' "large hooded cloak", which is perhaps of [[Gaulish language|Gaulish]] origin, or from [[Ancient Greek]] πυρρός ''pyrrhos'' "flame-colored, yellow".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=biretta "biretta"]. ''[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The cone-shaped red (seldom in black) biretta, related to the ancient Etruscan ''tutulus'' and the Roman ''pileus'', was used in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries to identify humanists, students, artists, and learned and blooming youth in general. The shape and the colour conveyed meaning: Red was considered for a long time the royal power, whether because it was difficult to afford vestments of such solid and brilliant dye or because the high symbolic meaning of blood and life, thus the power over life and death.

It is not casual that the ''capo'' (captain) headwear is found with such frequency in Renaissance paintings as the highly famous one by [[Piero della Francesca]] of [[Federico da Montefeltro]] with his red cap. Campano wrote about these hats in his ''Life of [[Niccolò Fortebraccio]]'',  "he used to wear a red and high hat, the higher from the head the wider it became." Federico and Niccolò were [[Condottieri]]. The same cap is seen on [[Bartolomeo Colleoni]], commander of the Venetian Armies in 1454, on the Duke [[Ludovico III Gonzaga]] and on [[John Hawkwood]] in his equestrian monument by Paolo Uccello. This cap as worn by the leading Italian nobles at the end of the fifteenth century became a symbol of their military and civil powers over Italian cities at a time when the whole of Europe was going to be deeply transformed by Italian influences.

It was originally reserved for holders of [[master's degree]]s (the highest qualification in mediæval academia) but was later adopted by [[Bachelor's degree|bachelors]] and [[undergraduate]]s. In the 16th and 17th centuries ''corner-cap'' ("catercap" in the [[Marprelate tracts]]) was the term used (''OED'').

Origins of the most commonly found mortarboard in the United States can be traced to a patent that was filed by an inventor Edward O'Reilly and Catholic priest Joseph Durham who filed their patent in 1950. Their invention and subsequent patent was the result of his idea to incorporate a [[fiberglass]] stiffener into the mortarboard thus making it more sturdy. Such mortarboards are very commonplace throughout the world today.&lt;ref&gt;US patent #2880423&lt;/ref&gt;

== Variants ==
[[Image:Columbus-ohio-franklin-university-corner.jpg|right|thumb|[[Franklin University]] in [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], Ohio features a giant steel mortarboard suspended over the street as a landmark.]]

[[Doctorate]] holders of some universities wear the mortarboard, although the round [[Tudor bonnet]] is more common in [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. The 4, 6, or 8 cornered "[[tam (cap)|tam]]" is gaining popularity in the US, and in general a soft square tam has some acceptance for women as a substitute for the hard 'square'.

In the US, the mortarboard is also worn by high school pupils during the presentation of their diplomas.

== Tassel ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2010}}
[[Image:graduationtassel.jpg|thumb|right|'''Graduation tassel''' A three-colour graduation tassel in burgundy, gold and white. The charm reveals it is from a 1987 ceremony. This particular tassel came from [[Piner High School]] in [[Santa Rosa, California|Santa Rosa]], California.]]

In US graduation ceremonies, the side on which the tassel hangs can be important.  Sometimes it is consistent among all students throughout the ceremony, in other cases it differs based on level of study with undergraduate students wearing the tassel on the right, and graduate student wearing them on the left.  In some ceremonies, the student wears the tassel on one side until reception of the diploma; then it is switched to the other.

At the secondary school level, the tassel is usually either the school's primary colour or a mix of the school's colours with as many as three colors in a tassel.  Sometimes a tassel of a distinctive colour, such as gold, is worn by those graduating with Latin Honours (i.e. ''cum laude'') or on the "honour roll".

Universities in the United States might use tassels in black or the school's colors, usually for higher degrees.

For bachelor's degrees the tassel may be colored differently from the traditional black or school colors to represent the field (or one as closely related as possible) in which the wearer obtained his or her education. In 1896 most colleges and universities in the United States adopted a uniform code governing academic dress.  The tassel may be adorned with a charm in the shape of the digits of the year.

However, strictly speaking, the [[American Council on Education]] (ACE) code states that "The tassel should be black or the colour appropriate to the subject," and only makes an exception for the gold tassel. The gold metallic tassel is reserved for those entitled to wear the [[doctorate|doctoral]] gown, as is the use of velvet for headwear. Only one tassel is worn at a time.

&lt;!-- Some of the links for the colour names are different than the colour names given by the ACE. This is because the links take the reader to the colour closest to that actually used by the ACE and academic hood manufacturers. So, when reading the article, one will see a close representation of the colour and the ACE name for the colour, and can click on the name to be taken to the article on the actual colour used. --&gt;

For schools where the graduation regalia is rented or borrowed by the student, the tassel might be a part of the rental or provided separately. Some schools that do not provide a tassel for graduates to keep may offer a souvenir tassel that is not worn with the regalia.

In the UK, the tassel is shorter and is gathered at the button at the centre of the board. The U.S. style is slightly longer, gathered at a cord attached to the button.

At the University of Cambridge, undergraduates by ancient convention used to cut their tassels very short so that the tassel does not extend beyond the edge of the board. After they graduated, they wore the square cap with the tassel at the normal length.&lt;ref&gt;Hoyle, Sir Fred, Home is where the wind blows, University Science books, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; This convention has now fallen into disuse; few people now wear headgear with academic dress at any time and undergraduates in particular have no need to wear the cap.

== Traditional wear ==
[[Image:Mortarboards.JPG|right|thumb|Two British mortarboards; left one is a folding-skull and the right one is a rigid-skull.]]
[[Image:Mourning cap.jpg|thumb|right|Top view of an academical mourning cap as used at Cambridge.]]

As with other forms of headdress, academic caps are not generally worn indoors by men (other than by the Chancellor or other high officials), but are usually carried.
At the [[University of Oxford]], caps are mandatory dress for matriculation events and for all examinations. It is a commonly repeated myth at Oxford that the cap must be held and may not be worn at all except at the student's graduation; however, there is no rule in the University to this effect, and undergraduates wearing formal academic dress may either carry the cap or wear it. In particular, women undergraduates who exercise the right to wear a soft "Canterbury" cap must wear it on their head, rather than carrying it.

In some graduation ceremonies caps have been dispensed with for men, being issued only to women, who do wear them indoors, or have been abandoned altogether. This has led to urban legends in a number of universities in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Ireland]] which have as a common theme that idea that the wearing of the cap was abandoned in protest at the admission of women to the university. This story is told {{by who?|date=September 2017}} at the Universities of [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], [[University of Dublin|Dublin]], [[Durham University|Durham]] and [[Newcastle University|Newcastle]], [[University of Bristol|Bristol]], [[University of St Andrews|St Andrews]], and the [[Queen's University, Belfast]] among others.

There are several types of mortarboard that are usually made. The most common in the UK is the 'folding skull' in which the skull part can be folded for ease of storing and carrying. Traditionally, the mortarboard had a 'rigid skull' which is considered more aesthetically pleasing and better fitting than a folding-skull one. In addition, the rigid skull type has the advantage of being easier to doff than the folding skull version, as there is no possibility of the skull collapsing in on itself. Many degree ceremonies in British universities include the ritual doffing of caps. Both types require the wearer to wear the appropriate size to fit. In the US, an 'elasticated skull' is mostly used which eliminates the need to make many mortarboards in different hat sizes. Some mortarboards, especially those in east Asia are laced-up at the back of the skull cap.

The correct way to wear a mortarboard is to have the larger part of the skull of the mortarboard at the back of the head with the top board parallel to the ground. A proper fitting mortarboard should not fall off easily.

Until the second half of the twentieth century, mortarboards were often worn by schoolteachers, and the hat remains an icon of the teaching profession.

Mortarboards are often seen in party supply shops in the United States in May and June, when they appear in the form of party decorations, on commemorative gifts such as [[teddy bear]]s, and on congratulatory greeting cards.

=== Mourning cap ===
There is a version of the mortarboard that is worn during mourning. Instead of a tassel and button on top of the board there are two black ribbons that are attached from corner to corner of the board forming a cross. At the centre where the two ribbons intersect a black ribbon rosette is attached. The ribbon for the wide ribbons is grosgrain ribbon whilst the rosette can be made of either the same grosgrain or satin. This mourning cap can be worn when mourning a personal friend or a family relative.

Another version has nine ribbon bows called "butterflies" attached to the back of the skull cap (three running vertically down the back seam, two vertically eitherside further towards the sides and one eitherside at the sides of the skull) in addition to the above. This cap is worn during the mourning of the monarch, a member of the royal family or the university chancellor.&lt;ref&gt;Hargreaves-Mawdsley, ''A History of Academical Dress in Europe Until the End of the Eighteenth Century'' (1963), p.137&lt;/ref&gt;

The mourning cap is worn with mourning bands (normal bands but with a pleat running down each band) and a mourning gown which is either a Cambridge DD undress gown with "pudding-sleeves" but in black stuff rather than silk as worn in the sixteenth-seventeenth centuries or a plain black stuff gown. Hoods are not worn, as they are considered festal items. However, Cambridge proctors in the past wore their MA hoods squared, so as to conceal the lining; since the lining was white it did not clash with the black and white color scheme of mourning.

'''Susy Dorn''' (born '''Susana Gabriela Rodriguez Santander''', July 20, 1974) is a teacher, [[composer]], musician, performer, producer, and the creator and founder of the Spanish Immersion Program "Let's Play in Spanish". Her teaching methodology includes theater, [[puppetry]], games, and music that she composes and sings.&lt;ref&gt;Aviles, Mary. [http://www.laht.com/article.asp?CategoryId=13003&amp;ArticleId=324206 "Teacher Combines Music &amp; Games with Spanish lessons"], ''[[Latin American Herald Tribune]]'', 2009-5-27. Retrieved on 2009-12-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Dorn was born and raised in [[Lima, Perú]]. She spent her preschool, elementary and high school years in an American school where she was immersed in the English language from age 3. She comes from a family of teachers. Her mother and father are both educators. Dorn got her Bachelor's Degree in Child Development Education from the [[Pontifical Catholic University of Peru]].&lt;ref&gt;R.G. van Diggelen, Alison. "Let's Play in Spanish: Susy Dorn", ''[[Bay Area Parent]]'', 2006-3-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founding Let's Play in Spanish==

Dorn moved to the [[United States]] in 1998 and started Spanish classes for 8 children in the house of a friend in downtown [[San Jose, California]]. The parent participation classes started growing by word of mouth and soon she found herself driving to different cities such as Palo Alto, Cupertino, Willow Glen and [[Campbell, California|Campbell]] to teach classes full-time. Soon after that, she established her main Spanish classes at the Campbell Community Center, where people drove all the way from San Francisco to take them.&lt;ref&gt;Wicks, Amy. "Immersion program draws youngest language learners", ''[[The Campbell Reporter]]'', 2003-9-17.&lt;/ref&gt;
Later on, she hired a qualified team of native Spanish teachers and brought the program to different cities. Today the program is established in Campbell, Santa Cruz,&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Alia. "Teacher puts the fun in fundamentals", ''[[Santa Cruz Sentinel]]'', 2008-9-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Palo Alto, San Mateo and San Francisco &lt;ref&gt;Aviles, Mary. [http://www.peru.com/noticias/sgc/portada/2008/12/26/detalle17544.aspx "EE.UU: Educadora Peruana enseña español con música y juegos"], ''[[Perú.com]]'', 2008-12-26.&lt;/ref&gt;  attracting more than 700 children from 10 months to 9 years of age.

Dorn and the "Juguemos" team have performed numerous times all around the San Francisco Bay Area attracting hundreds of young followers and their parents to the concerts. Several performances have been done with benefit purposes for Peruvian street children.&lt;ref&gt;EFE.

==Discography, movies and books==

Dorn has composed and produced original materials in CDs, DVDs and books that allow parents to take the lessons home.

'''''The Cartel''''' is a 2009 [[United States|American]] [[documentary film]] by [[New Jersey]]-based television producer, reporter and news anchor Bob Bowdon, that covers the failures of [[public education]] in the United States by focusing on New Jersey, which has the highest level of per-student education spending in the U.S.&lt;ref name="thecartelmovie.com"&gt;http://www.thecartelmovie.com/cgi-local/content.cgi?g=20&lt;/ref&gt; According to The Internet Movie Database (IMDb), the film asks: "How has the richest and most innovative society on earth suddenly lost the ability to teach its children at a level that other modern countries consider 'basic'?"&lt;ref name="imdb.com"&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1433001/&lt;/ref&gt; The film regards [[teachers' union]]s as the cause of the problems (they are "the cartel" of the title), due to, among other things, the obstacles they put in place to firing bad teachers, through [[tenure]]. It also makes the case for [[school voucher]]s and [[charter school]]s,&lt;ref name="nj.com"&gt;http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2009/05/nj_educational_system_examined.html&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that the increased [[Competition (economics)|competition]] will revitalize the school system, leading to improved efficiency and performance in all schools, both district and charter.

The film debuted at the [[Hoboken International Film Festival]] on May 30, 2009 and was awarded "Best of the Festival (Audience Award)".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hobokeninternationalfilmfestival.com/&lt;/ref&gt; It opened in New York City and Los Angeles on April 16, 2010, Houston on April 23 and in Denver, Minneapolis, Boston, Washington D.C., St. Louis, San Francisco, Philadelphia and Chicago on April 30.

''The Cartel'' is Bowdon's first film; he left [[Bloomberg Television]] to focus on the project, and spent two years on it.&lt;ref name="nj.com" /&gt; The film's post production was aided by the [[Moving Picture Institute]].

==Film content==
Bowdon interviewed "school administrators, teachers, parents, students and education advocates" for the film.&lt;ref name="nj.com"/&gt; Among the interviews are State Education Commissioner [[Lucille Davy]], [[Clint Bolick]] (former president of [[Alliance for School Choice]]), Gerard Robinson (president of [[Black Alliance for Educational Options]]), and [[Chester E. Finn, Jr.|Chester Finn]] (president of the [[Thomas B. Fordham Institute]]).&lt;ref name="thecartelmovie.com"/&gt;

===Administrative waste===
The film highlights the problem of waste and corruption in the New Jersey public school system that Bowdon claims is rampant in districts throughout the country.  He chooses the New Jersey area as it serves as an example of what can happen when problems are addressed by allocating more budget money to a problem rather than attempting to find and correct the problem directly. The administrative inefficiency present in New Jersey is highlighted by Bowden's comparison of the state's educational system to that of another state that Bowden explains is chosen because it is nearby and similarly populated, [[Maryland]].  On average, Maryland has one school district for 35,000 students, whereas New Jersey has 15 school districts for the same number of students.

During 2008 budget crisis, while many other departments were "on the chopping block" (proposed budget had 4B in cuts), the teacher's union successfully lobbied for a 5% increase in education spending.

Construction costs and related corruption also represent a major cost according to Bowden.  The New Jersey School Construction Corporation (SCC), now known as the [[New Jersey Schools Development Authority]] (NJSDA), which was responsible for the managing of construction of schools and educational infrastructure in the state allegedly didn't have any set budget, and was not monitored effectively by any other body; as a result, it is alleged that the organization "lost" between $500 million and $1 billion without a trace to poor accounting.

Bowden points out [[Malcolm X Shabazz High School]], which he describes as one of the many under-performing schools in the state, which spent 6 million dollars on constructing a brand new "state of the art" football field,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Malcolm X. Shabazz Athletic Facility|url=http://www.yu-associates.com/geotechnical/malcolm-x-shabazz-athletic-facility|publisher=Yu &amp; Associates Geotechnical, Environmental and Civil Engineering|accessdate=5 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than spending the same money to improve academics.

===Inability to remove poor-performing teachers===
Another major problem with the public school system according to Bowden is the difficulty with firing tenured teachers, seemingly no matter how bad they are.  Rules originally put in place by the teacher's unions to protect teachers, he argues, have come to hinder fairness and accountability and actually hurt good teachers by keeping bad ones in place.  He cites as one example an [[Literacy|illiterate]] high school teacher in California who taught for seventeen years, relying upon the help of "student aides" to do the necessary in-class reading and writing for him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Yau|first=Margaret|title=OCEANSIDE: Teacher who beat illiteracy marks 15th anniversary of tutoring program|url=http://www.nctimes.com/news/local/oceanside/oceanside-teacher-who-beat-illiteracy-marks-th-anniversary-of-tutoring/article_5cb0b68c-4304-542f-9d00-5f6a66960a15.html|accessdate=6 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During her interview, the head of the New Jersey Education Association (NJEA) Joyce Powell responded to criticisms of the tenure process: when presented with a statistic that only 0.03% of tenured teachers are removed from the classroom, she suggested that this was true because 99.97% are "doing a good job," saying "I think 99.97% should be celebrated."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailyrecord.com/article/20090826/COLUMNISTS01/90825044/1100/NEWS01/A+film+about+N.J.+s+education+&lt;/ref&gt;

===Performance of charter schools===
As a counterpoint to all of these types of problems, Bowden suggests that the increased prevalence of [[charter school]]s which compete for students and government funding with public schools will have the effect of improving quality and efficiency across the board.  Students at charter schools have been shown to frequently perform better than their counterparts in the same areas; some assume that this is the case because they admit better-performing students to begin with, but many, like the [[North Star Academy Charter School]], select students by random lottery, often with incoming students who perform slightly lower than the district average.  North Star, as an example, spends 25% less per student, even without the large [[economies of scale]] of the large district.

8th graders of the [[Robert Treat Academy Charter School]] achieved far higher proficiency rates than students in the Newark District school on the 2007 [[New Jersey Assessment of Skills and Knowledge|GEPA]] at a far lower cost per student: 88.4% to 49.9% in language arts; 93.0% to 35.3% in math; with $10,994 versus $17,237 of spending per student, respectively.

Bowden also notes examples of charters that don't outperform district schools in their same area, like the Hope Academy, which scored far lower in language arts and math proficiency (27.8 to 21.4% in language arts, 19.6 to 14.3% in math), but says that parents will often still prefer charters, simply to get their children out of dangerous situations that exist in the public schools.  One Hope Academy student describes his old school as being "just like" the school in the film ''[[Lean on Me (film)|Lean on Me]]'', "before [[Joe Louis Clark|Joe Clark]] came in."

Perhaps the most major hindrance to the creation of charter schools, he suggests, is that the [[New Jersey Department of Education]] (NJ DOE) has the sole power to approve or deny charter school applicants, and in 2008, approved just one out of 22.  They are not required to give applicants any reasons for denial, but applicants interviewed in the film allege that they were denied on seemingly trivial mistakes in their lengthy applications.

The street interviews Bowden conducted indicate that people invariably support the increased funding of schools under the understanding that increased funding will improve the quality of education in the United States; Bowden, on the other hand, argues that efficiency and quality is best achieved through competition of resources which demands that efficiency and quality be achieved in order to thrive and attract "customers".  While people commonly cite the concern that charter schools will take away funding to the detriment of the public school system, Bowden argues that they will benefit as much as anyone else from the competition and perhaps, smaller classroom sizes.

The film credits include the reminder, "There are good teachers in the worst schools. There are good administrators in the worst districts.  Support them! (While you fight The Cartel).

==Controversy==
The NJEA called ''The Cartel'' "an orchestrated attack against public schools and the New Jersey Education Association (NJEA)."  Furthermore, the NJEA stated that Bowdon and his crew failed to identify their "true agenda" when interviewing Powell, instead questioning her under false pretenses of an "independent 'documentary on public education in New Jersey,' with a focus on No Child Left Behind, the state school funding law, and charter schools."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.njea.org/page.aspx?a=4149&lt;/ref&gt;

Bowdon said that the NJEA invented the fact that the film had had any financial support before it was completely finished, and that his partnerships and financial support were all post production.  He said that rather than addressing any of the film's substantive arguments, they focused instead on personal attacks at him.  He also said, "It's more than a little ironic that the NJEA criticized me for lack of transparency through an anonymous author."

Davy said that some issues raised by ''The Cartel'', particularly superintendents' contracts, were already addressed with new accountability regulations.&lt;ref name="nj.com"/&gt;

==Reception==
Wesley Morris of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' wrote, "as is the wont of certain TV news reporting, his approach pre-chews every detail, lest we fail to understand it. He’s smart. We’re dumb. Let the animated inserts explain the facts." He added, "it’s a testament to how fascinatingly bad things are for our public schools that 'The Cartel' is as watchable as it is."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Cartel: A digestible lesson in public-school failures|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/movies/articles/2010/04/30/in_the_cartel_a_condescending_lesson_in_public_school_failures/ |newspaper=The Boston Globe | first=Wesley |last=Morris |date=April 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brian MacQuarrie of the Boston Globe says that in ''The Cartel'', "the causes and consequences of the failings of public education are chronicled in extraordinary detail."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=MacQuarrie|first=Brian|title=‘The Cartel’ sees teacher unions’ grip as crippling|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/movies/articles/2010/04/25/the_cartel_focuses_on_the_stultifying_effect_teacher_unions_are_having_on_the_public_school_system/|publisher=the Boston Globe|accessdate=6 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amy Biancolli of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' wrote, "There's no history offered. Not a peep about [[No Child Left Behind]]. What's more, there's no breakdown of urban Jersey's demographics - the percentage of kids on school lunch aid, perhaps? - or any attempt to link classroom woes with urban problems. Yet even these gaps wouldn't have doomed the movie if Bowdon had sexed it up with a bit of old-fashioned cinematic salesmanship. The film plays more like a 90-minute TV special than a feature release. It's all talking heads, clanging music, substandard graphics, long scans of Web-page headlines and Bowdon's heavily cadenced voiceovers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Review: 'The Cartel' rates a failing grade |url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2010-04-30/movies/20877466_1_school-choice-charter-schools-public-school|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle |first=Amy |last=Biancolli |date=April 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Matt Pais of the website [[Metromix]] wrote, "Bowdon would have something if he scaled back the outrage and analyzed the causes of these practices and, ultimately, why so many children around the country aren’t being properly taught. Instead the filmmaker tries to position New Jersey as a microcosm of America and turns “The Cartel” into a local news report that goes on forever."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title='The Cartel' review |url=http://newyork.metromix.com/movies/movie_review/the-cartel-review/1907435/content |work=Metromix New York |first=Matt |last=Pais |date=April 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kyle Smith of the [[New York Post]] writes, "For parents of kids in public schools, the heartbreaking documentary "The Cartel" is a revelation," and that "few documentaries have covered such an important matter so convincingly and with such clarity. When it comes to public education, we are all New Jerseyans."&lt;ref name="NY Post"&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Kyle|title=NJ paradox: Piles of cash, failing schools|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/movies/nj_paradox_piles_of_cash_failing_6o8Pcvx3GsRs8zLRei98fK|work=New York Post|accessdate=6 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Los Angeles Times]]' Kevin Thomas calls the film a "brisk, incisive and mind-boggling — no other phrase will work — exposé of his native New Jersey's public education system," saying that "Bowdon moves beyond statistics to discover how the sorry condition of his state's public schools came to be."&lt;ref name="LA Times"&gt;{{cite web|last=Thomas|first=Kevin|title=Capsule Movie Reviews: ‘The Cartel’ examines a state falling down on the job in educating its children|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/apr/16/entertainment/la-et-capsules-20100416|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=6 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
New Jersey Governor [[Chris Christie]], who came into office in 2010, saw the movie before being elected, and said that it "helped to mold for me the final outlines of what I wanted to do if I were lucky enough to become governor." He praised that documentary, as well as ''Waiting for "Superman"'', which came out after he was already governor.  In another interview, he said that the film was "extraordinarily important" in that it tells a story about what is going on in the New Jersey public school system that "needs to be told."&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|-9KY8uAxIJA|Chris Christie Comments on The Cartel Movie -- Extended Cut}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Udutu''' is an [[Software as a service|SAAS]] platform for [[e-learning]], and is based in [[Victoria, British Columbia]]. The company's '''Udutu LMS''' product is used for employee training, customer training, channel training, and compliance training. Udutu also offers a course authoring tool and a PowerPoint to HTML5 converter for [[SCORM]] compatibility.

Udutu has just over 79,000 active registered users &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Best Elearning of 2015 |url=http://www.2elearning.com/latest-news/item/56391-best-of-elearning-2015-finalists-revealed 
 |accessdate=2018-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; of their authoring tool with 161,000 user-generated courses in their system.

==History==
Udutu's LMS and Course Authoring Tool were developed out of a [[Royal Roads University]] (RRU) initiative started in 1995&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Interview With Roger Mundell |url=https://www.udutu.com/blog/an-interview-with-roger-mundell/ 
 |accessdate=2018-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;. At that time, RRU was a newly established university with a mandate to grow its course offerings and student population, but with limited financial and capital resources to do so. In order to grow, RRU focused on developing software tools that could deliver coursework online.

Udutu was spun off from Royal Roads in 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Udutu Wins Red Herring Award |url=http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/elearning-provider-udutu-named-red-herring-canada-top-50-winner-for-2008-903520.htm |accessdate=2018-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
