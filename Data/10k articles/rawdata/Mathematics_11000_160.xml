|title = NRL and the Advanced Narrowband Secure Voice Terminal (ANDVT)
|url = http://www.nrl.navy.mil/itd/sites/www.nrl.navy.mil.itd/files/files/itd_accomp_andvt.pdf
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Devices in the ANDVT family include the AN/USC-43 Tactical Terminal (TACTERM), the KY-99A Miniaturized Terminal (MINTERM), and the KY-100 Airborne Terminal (AIRTERM). ANDVT uses [[LPC-10]] voice compression.

The functions of the MINTERM are similar to those of the TACTERM; its updated design includes an improved modular architecture, and it has been reduced in size. The MINTERM is lightweight, low-power, single channel, half-duplex, narrowband/wideband/wireline terminal providing secure voice and data communications with full key distribution and remote rekey capabilities. The MINTERM is certified to secure traffic up to TOP SECRET.

The MINTERM improvements include the following:
*Concurrent voice and data modes enable the users to connect both data equipment and voice handsets.
*[[VINSON]] (KY-57/58) mode of operation allows interoperability between the MINTERM and the VINSON wideband COMSEC equipment.
* improved SATCOM performance
* The latest DOD LPC-10 algorithm (V58) which has been enhanced to provide high-quality secure narrowband voice for military handsets and to maintain that quality and intelligibility in noisy acoustical environments.

The AIRTERM is a lightweight, self-contained secure voice and data terminal that provides secure half-duplex voice, digital data, analog data, and remote-keying capabilities for transmission over radio circuits or wireline media. It is a wideband/narrowband terminal that interoperates with the TACTERM, MINTERM, VINSON, and Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System ([[SINCGARS]]).  AIRTERM accepts classified analog voice information and uses LPC-10 at 2.4 kbit/s in narrowband voice modes and continuously variable slope delta (CVSD) modulation at 12 kbit/s and 16 kbit/s in wideband voice modes. The AIRTERM provides the same connectors, with similar functional pinouts, as the VINSON for the wideband operational modes. [http://www.fas.org/irp/program/security/_work/andvt.html]

{{Refimprove|date=January 2010}}
In mathematics, the '''additive inverse''' of a [[number]] {{mvar|a}} is the number that, when [[addition|added]] to {{mvar|a}}, yields [[0 (number)|zero]].
This number is also known as the '''opposite''' (number),&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Elementary Algebra|first1=Alan|last1=Tussy|first2=R.|last2=Gustafson|edition=5th|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2012|isbn=9781133710790|page=40|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=De4KAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA40}}.&lt;/ref&gt; '''sign change''', and '''negation'''.&lt;ref&gt;The term [[negation (disambiguation)|"negation"]] bears a reference to [[negative number]]s, which can be misleading, because the additive inverse of a negative number is positive.&lt;/ref&gt; For a [[real number]], it reverses its [[sign (mathematics)|sign]]: the opposite to a [[positive number]] is negative, and the opposite to a [[negative number]] is positive.  [[0 (number)|Zero]] is the additive inverse of itself.

The additive inverse of {{mvar|a}} is denoted by [[unary operation|unary]] [[minus sign|minus]]: −{{mvar|a}} (see the discussion [[#Relation to subtraction|below]]). For example, the additive inverse of 7 is −7, because 7&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;(−7)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, and the additive inverse of −0.3 is 0.3, because −0.3&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;0.3&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 .

The additive inverse is defined as its [[inverse element]] under the [[binary operation]] of addition (see the discussion [[#Formal definition|below]]), which allows a broad [[generalization]] to mathematical objects other than numbers. As for any inverse operation, [[function composition|double]] additive inverse has [[identity function|no net effect]]: {{math|−(−''x'') {{=}} ''x''}}.
{{anchor|diameter}}[[Image:NegativeI2Root.svg|thumb|right|These complex numbers, two of eight values of [[root of unity|{{radic|1|8}}]], are mutually opposite]]

==Common examples==
For a number and, generally, in any [[ring (algebra)|ring]], the additive inverse can be calculated using [[multiplication]] by [[−1]]; that is, {{math|1=−{{mvar|n}} = &amp;minus;1 × {{mvar|n}}}} . Examples of rings of numbers are [[integer]]s, [[rational number]]s, [[real number]]s, and [[complex number]]s.

===Relation to subtraction===
Additive inverse is closely related to [[subtraction]], which can be viewed as an addition of the opposite:
:{{math|''a'' − ''b''  {{=}}  ''a'' + (−''b'')}}.
Conversely, additive inverse can be thought of as subtraction from zero:
:{{math|−''a''  {{=}}  0 − ''a''}}.
Hence, unary minus sign notation can be seen as a shorthand for subtraction with "0" symbol omitted, although in a correct [[typography]] there should be no [[space (punctuation)|space]] after unary&amp;nbsp;"−".

===Other properties===
In addition to the identities listed above, negation has the following algebraic properties:
* {{math|− (- ''a'') {{=}} ''a''}}, it is an [[Involution (mathematics)|Involution operation]]
* {{math|−(''a'' + ''b'') {{=}} (−''a'') + (−''b'')}}
* {{math|''a'' − (−''b'') {{=}} ''a'' + ''b''}}
* {{math|(−''a'') × ''b'' {{=}} ''a'' × (−''b'') {{=}} −(''a'' × ''b'')}}
* {{math|(−''a'') × (−''b'') {{=}} ''a'' × ''b'' }}
*: notably, {{math|(−''a'')[[square (algebra)|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]] {{=}} ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; }}

==Formal definition==
The notation '''+''' is usually reserved for [[commutative]] binary operations; i.e., such that {{math|1={{mvar|x}} + {{mvar|y}} = {{mvar|y}} + {{mvar|x}}}}, for all {{mvar|x}}, {{mvar|y}}. If such an operation admits an [[identity element]] {{mvar|o}} (such that {{math|1={{mvar|x}} + ''o'' ( = ''o'' + {{mvar|x}} ) = {{mvar|x}}}} for all {{mvar|x}}), then this element is unique ( {{math|1=''o&amp;prime;'' = ''o&amp;prime;'' + ''o'' = ''o''}} ). For a given {{mvar|x}} , if there exists {{mvar|x&amp;prime;}} such that {{math|1={{mvar|x}} + {{mvar|x&amp;prime;}} ( = {{mvar|x&amp;prime;}} + {{mvar|x}} ) = ''o''}} , then {{mvar|x&amp;prime;}} is called an additive inverse of {{mvar|x}}.

If + is [[associativity|associative]] ({{math|1=( ''x'' + ''y'' ) + ''z'' = ''x'' + ( ''y'' + ''z'' )}} for all {{mvar|x}}, {{mvar|y}}, {{mvar|z}}), then an additive inverse is unique. To see this, let {{mvar|x&amp;prime;}} and {{mvar|x″}} each be additive inverses of {{mvar|x}}; then

:{{math|1=''x&amp;prime;'' = ''x&amp;prime;'' + ''o'' = ''x&amp;prime;'' + (''x'' + ''x″'') = (''x&amp;prime;'' + ''x'') + ''x″'' = ''o'' + ''x″'' = ''x″''}}.

For example, since addition of real numbers is associative, each real number has a unique additive inverse.

== Other examples ==
All the following examples are in fact [[abelian group]]s:

* [[complex number]]s: {{math|−(''a'' + ''bi'')  {{=}}  (−''a'') + (−''b'')''i''}}. On the [[complex plane]], this operation [[rotation (mathematics)|rotates]] a complex number 180 [[degree (angle)|degrees]] around the [[origin (mathematics)|origin]] (see the image [[#diameter|above]]).
* addition of real- and complex-valued functions: here, the additive inverse of a function {{mvar|f}} is the function −{{mvar|f}} defined by {{math|1=(−''f'' )(''x'') = − ''f'' (''x'')}} , for all {{mvar|x}}, such that {{math|1=''f'' + (−''f'' ) = ''o''}} , the zero function ( {{math|1=''o''(''x'') = 0}} for all {{mvar|x}} ).
* more generally, what precedes applies to all functions with values in an abelian group ('zero' meaning then the identity element of this group):
* [[sequence]]s, [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] and [[net (mathematics)|nets]] are also special kinds of functions.
* In a [[vector space]] the additive inverse {{math|−'''v'''}} is often called the opposite vector of {{math|'''v'''}}; it has the same [[norm (mathematics)|magnitude]] as the original and opposite direction. Additive inversion corresponds to [[scalar multiplication]] by −1. For [[Euclidean space]], it is [[point reflection]] in the origin. Vectors in exactly opposite directions (multiplied to negative numbers) are sometimes referred to as '''antiparallel'''.
** [[vector space]]-valued functions (not necessarily linear),
* In [[modular arithmetic]], the '''modular additive inverse''' of {{mvar|x}} is also defined: it is the number {{mvar|a}} such that {{math|1={{mvar|a}} + {{mvar|x}} ≡ 0 (mod {{mvar|n}})}}.  This additive inverse always exists. For example, the inverse of 3 modulo 11 is 8 because it is the solution to {{math|1= 3 + ''x'' ≡ 0 (mod 11)}}.

== Non-examples ==
[[Natural number]]s, [[cardinal number]]s, and [[ordinal number]]s, do not have additive inverses within their respective [[Set (mathematics)|sets]]. Thus, for example, we can say that natural numbers ''do'' have additive inverses, but because these additive inverses are not themselves natural numbers, the set of natural numbers is not [[closure (mathematics)|''closed'']] under taking additive inverses.

'''Amit Sahai''' ({{lang-hi|अमित सहाय}}; born 1974) is an American computer scientist. He is a professor of [[computer science]] at the [[University of California Los Angeles|UCLA]] and the director of the Center for Encrypted Functionalities at UCLA.&lt;ref name="fe-center"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.ucla.edu/cef/|title=Center for Encrypted Functionalities}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Amit Sahai was born in 1974 in Thousand Oaks, California, to parents who had
immigrated from India. He received a B.A. in mathematics with a computer
science minor from the University of California, Berkeley, summa cum laude, in
1996.&lt;ref name="princeton"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.princeton.edu/engineering/eqnews/fall00/faculty1.html|title=EQuad News, Princeton University, Fall 2000, Volume 13, No. 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
At Berkeley, Sahai was named Computing Research Association Outstanding
Undergraduate of the Year, North America, and was a member of the three-person
team that won first place in the 1996 [[ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icpc.baylor.edu/community/history-icpc-1996|title=History - ICPC 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sahai received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from MIT in 2000, and joined the
computer science faculty at Princeton University.&lt;ref name="princeton" /&gt; In
2004 he moved to UCLA, where he currently holds the position of Professor of
Computer Science.

==Research and Recognition==
Amit Sahai's research interests are in security and cryptography, and theoretical
computer science more broadly. He has published more than 100 original
technical research papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{DBLP|name=Amit Sahai}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable contributions by Sahai include:
* '''Obfuscation.''' Sahai is a co-inventor of the first candidate general-purpose cryptographic obfuscation schemes, with security based on a mathematical conjecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Sanjam Garg |author2=Craig Gentry |author3=Shai Halevi |author4=Mariana Raykova |author5=Amit Sahai |author6=Brent Waters | date = 2013 | title = Candidate Indistinguishability Obfuscation and Functional Encryption for all Circuits.| journal = Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS), 2013 IEEE 54th Annual Symposium on| publisher = IEEE|pages = 40–49. | doi = 10.1109/FOCS.2013.13|citeseerx=10.1.1.672.1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; This development generated much interest in the cryptography community and was called "a watershed moment for cryptography."&lt;ref name="wired"/&gt; Earlier, Sahai co-authored a seminal paper formalizing the notion of cryptographic obfuscation and showing that strong forms of this notion are impossible to realize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal = Journal of the ACM |title = On the (im)possibility of obfuscating programs |volume = 59 |issue = 2 |date = April 2012 |doi=10.1145/2160158.2160159}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Functional Encryption.''' Sahai co-authored papers which introduced [[attribute-based encryption]] and [[functional encryption]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Dan Boneh |author2=Amit Sahai |author3=Brent Waters | date = 2011 | title = Functional encryption: Definitions and challenges | journal = Theory of Cryptography | publisher = Springer Berlin Heidelberg | volume = 6597 (Lecture Notes in Computer Science) | pages = 253–273. | doi = 10.1007/978-3-642-19571-6_16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Results on Zero-Knowledge Proofs.''' Sahai co-authored several important results on [[zero-knowledge proofs]], in particular introducing the concept of concurrent zero-knowledge proofs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Cynthia |last=Dwork |first2=Moni |last2=Naor |first3=Amit |last3=Sahai |title=Concurrent Zero Knowledge |journal=Journal of the ACM |volume=51 |issue=6 |pages=851–898 |year=2004 |doi=10.1145/1039488.1039489 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sahai also co-authored the paper that introduced the ''MPC-in-the-head'' technique for using [[secure multi-party computation]] (MPC) protocols for efficient zero-knowledge proofs.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal |author1=Yuval Ishai |author2=Eyal Kushilevitz |author3=Rafail Ostrovsky |author4=Amit Sahai |title = Zero-Knowledge Proofs from Secure Multiparty Computation |journal= SIAM J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6205">In [[complex analysis]], a discipline in mathematics, and in [[statistical physics]], the '''Asano contraction''' or '''Asano–Ruelle contraction''' is a transformation on a separately affine multivariate polynomial. It was first presented in 1970 by Taro Asano to prove the [[Lee–Yang theorem]] in the [[Heisenberg model (quantum)|Heisenberg spin model]] case. This also yielded a simple proof of the Lee–Yang theorem in the [[Ising model]]. [[David Ruelle]] proved a general theorem relating the location of the roots of a contracted polynomial to that of the original. Asano contractions have also been used to study polynomials in graph theory.

==Definition==
Let &lt;math&gt;\Phi(z_1,z_2,\ldots,z_n)&lt;/math&gt; be a polynomial which, when viewed as a function of only one of these variables is an [[linear equation|affine function]]. Such functions are called separately affine. For example, &lt;math&gt;a+bz_1+cz_2+dz_1z_2&lt;/math&gt; is the general form of a separately affine function in two variables. Any separately affine function can be written in terms of any two of its variables as &lt;math&gt;\Phi(z_i,z_j)=a+bz_i+cz_j+dz_iz_j&lt;/math&gt;. The Asano contraction &lt;math&gt;(z_i,z_j)\mapsto z&lt;/math&gt; sends &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\Phi}=a+dz&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=lebowitz&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lebowitz|first1=Joel|last2=Ruelle|first2=David|last3=Speer|first3=Eugene|title=Location of the Lee–Yang zeros and absence of phase transitions in some Ising spin systems|journal=Journal of Mathematical Physics|date=2012|volume=53|url=http://www.ihes.fr/~ruelle/PUBLICATIONS/%5B157%5D.pdf|accessdate=13 May 2015|doi=10.1063/1.4738622|arxiv=1204.0558|bibcode=2012JMP....53i5211L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location of zeroes==
Asano contractions are often used in the context of theorems about the location of roots. Asano originally used them because they preserve the property of having no roots when all the variables have magnitude greater than 1.&lt;ref name=asano&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Asano|first1=Taro|title=Theorems on the Partition Functions of the Heisenberg Ferromagnets|journal=Journal of the Physical Society of Japan|date=August 1970|volume=29|issue=2|pages=350–359|doi=10.1143/jpsj.29.350|bibcode=1970JPSJ...29..350A}}&lt;!--|accessdate=13 May 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Ruelle provided a more general relationship which allowed the contractions to be used in more applications.&lt;ref name=textbook&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gruber|first1=C.|last2=Hintermann|first2=A.|last3=Merlini|first3=D.|title=Group Analysis of Classical Lattice Systems|date=1977|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|isbn=978-3-540-37407-7|pages=162|url=https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/3-540-08137-2|accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He showed that if there are [[closed set]]s &lt;math&gt;M_1,M_2,\ldots,M_n&lt;/math&gt; not containing 0 such that &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; cannot vanish unless &lt;math&gt;z_i\in M_i&lt;/math&gt; for some index &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\Phi}=((z_j,z_k)\mapsto z)(\Phi)&lt;/math&gt; can only vanish if &lt;math&gt;z_i\in M_i&lt;/math&gt; for some index &lt;math&gt;i\neq k,j&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;z\in -M_jM_k&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;-M_jM_k=\{-ab;a\in M_j,b\in M_k\}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref name=ruelle&gt;.{{cite journal|last1=Ruelle|first1=David|title=Extension of the Lee–Yang Circle Theorem|journal=Physical Review Letters|date=1971|volume=26|issue=6|pages=303–304|url=http://www.ihes.fr/~ruelle/PUBLICATIONS/%5B31%5D.pdf|accessdate=13 May 2015|doi=10.1103/physrevlett.26.303|bibcode=1971PhRvL..26..303R}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruelle and others have used this theorem to relate the zeroes of the partition function to zeroes of the partition function of its subsystems.

==Use==
Asano contractions can be used in statistical physics to gain information about a system from its subsystems. For example, suppose we have a system with a finite set &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; of particles with [[spin (physics)|magnetic spin]] either 1 or -1. For each site, we have a complex variable &lt;math&gt;z_x&lt;/math&gt; Then we can define a separately affine polynomial &lt;math&gt;P(z_\Lambda)=\sum_{X\subseteq \Lambda}c_X z^{X}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;z^X=\prod_{x\in X}z_x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;c_X=e^{-\beta U(X)}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;U(X)&lt;/math&gt; is the energy of the state where only the sites in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; have positive spin. If all the variables are the same, this is the [[Partition function (statistical mechanics)|partition function]]. Now if &lt;math&gt;\Lambda=\Lambda_1\cap\Lambda_2&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;P(z_\Lambda)&lt;/math&gt; is obtained from &lt;math&gt;P(z_{\Lambda_1})P(z_{\Lambda_2})&lt;/math&gt; by contracting the variable attached to identical sites.&lt;ref name=ruelle /&gt; This is because the Asano contraction essentially eliminates all terms where the spins at a site are distinct in the &lt;math&gt;P(z_{\Lambda_1})&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P(z_{\Lambda_2})&lt;/math&gt;.

Ruelle has also used Asano contractions to find information about the location of roots of a generalization of [[matching polynomial]]s which he calls graph-counting polynomials. He assigns a variable to each edge. For each vertex, he computes a symmetric polynomial in the variables corresponding to the edges incident on that vertex. The symmetric polynomial contains the terms of degree equal to the allowed degree for that node. He then multiplies these symmetric polynomials together and uses Asano contractions to only keep terms where the edge is present at both its endpoints. By using the [[Grace–Walsh–Szegő theorem]] and intersecting all the sets that can be obtained, Ruelle gives sets containing the roots of several types of these symmetric polynomials. Since the graph-counting polynomial was obtained from these by Asano contractions, most of the remaining work is computing products of these sets.&lt;ref name=graphcount&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ruelle|first1=David|title=Zeros of Graph-Counting Polynomials|journal=Communications in Mathematical Physics|date=1999|volume=200|pages=43–56|url=http://download-v2.springer.com/static/pdf/715/art%253A10.1007%252Fs002200050522.pdf?token2=exp=1432328921~acl=%2Fstatic%2Fpdf%2F715%2Fart%25253A10.1007%25252Fs002200050522.pdf*~hmac=d788d6228e08f8716f75d1ce7d5755b1b7af411102cf35a4886998e887f526a7|doi=10.1007/s002200050522|bibcode=1999CMaPh.200...43R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1782">In [[mathematics]], specifically [[functional analysis]], the '''barrier cone''' is a [[cone (linear algebra)|cone]] associated to any non-empty subset of a [[Banach space]].  It is closely related to the notions of [[support function]]s and [[polar set]]s.

==Definition==

Let ''X'' be a Banach space and let ''K'' be a non-empty subset of ''X''.  The '''barrier cone''' of ''K'' is the subset ''b''(''K'') of ''X''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;, the [[continuous dual space]] of ''X'', defined by

The function

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{K} \colon \ell \mapsto \sup_{x \in K} \langle \ell, x \rangle,&lt;/math&gt;

defined for each [[continuous linear functional]] ''ℓ'' on ''X'', is known as the [[support function]] of the set ''K'';  thus, the barrier cone of ''K'' is precisely the set of continuous linear functionals ''ℓ'' for which ''&amp;sigma;''&lt;sub&gt;''K''&lt;/sub&gt;(''ℓ'') is finite.

The set of continuous linear functionals ''ℓ'' for which ''&amp;sigma;''&lt;sub&gt;''K''&lt;/sub&gt;(''ℓ'')&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;1 is known as the [[polar set]] of ''K''.  The set of continuous linear functionals ''ℓ'' for which ''&amp;sigma;''&lt;sub&gt;''K''&lt;/sub&gt;(''ℓ'')&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;0 is known as the (negative) [[polar cone]] of ''K''.  Clearly, both the polar set and the negative polar cone are subsets of the barrier cone.

In [[quantum mechanics]], '''bra–ket notation''' is a standard notation for describing [[quantum state]]s. It can also be used to denote abstract [[vector space|vectors]] and [[linear functional]]s in [[mathematics]]. The notation uses [[angle bracket]]s (the ⟨ and ⟩ symbols) and a [[vertical bar]] (the | symbol), to denote the [[scalar product]] of vectors or the action of a linear functional on a vector in a complex vector space.  The scalar product or action is written as

:&lt;math&gt;\langle\phi{\mid}\psi\rangle.&lt;/math&gt;

The right part is called the '''ket''' {{IPAc-en|k|ɛ|t}}; it is a [[vector space|vector]], typically represented as a [[column vector]] and written 

:&lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle.&lt;/math&gt;

The left part is called the '''bra''', {{IPAc-en|b|r|ɑː}}; it is the [[Hermitian conjugate]] of the ket with the same label, typically represented as a [[row vector]] and is written

:&lt;math&gt;\langle\phi|.&lt;/math&gt;

A combination of bras, kets, and operators is interpreted using [[matrix multiplication]]. A bra and a ket with the same label are [[Hermitian conjugate]]s of each other.

Bra-ket notation was introduced in 1939 by [[Paul Dirac]]&lt;ref name="Dirac"&gt;{{harvnb|Dirac|1939}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shankar|1994|loc=Chapter 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is also known as the '''Dirac notation'''.  

The bra-ket notation has a precursor in [[Hermann Grassmann]]'s use of the notation &lt;math&gt;[\phi{\mid}\psi]&lt;/math&gt;for his inner products nearly 100 years earlier.&lt;ref name="Grassmann"&gt;{{harvnb|Grassmann|1862}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
Bra–ket notation is a notation for [[linear algebra]], particularly focused on vectors, [[inner product]]s, [[linear operator]]s, [[Hermitian conjugation]], and the [[dual space]], for both finite-dimensional and infinite-dimensional [[complex vector space]]s. It is specifically designed to ease the types of calculations that frequently come up in [[quantum mechanics]].

Its use in quantum mechanics is quite widespread. Many phenomena that are explained using quantum mechanics are usually explained using bra–ket notation.

In simple cases, a ket {{math|{{ket|''m''}}}} can be described as a [[column vector]], a bra with the same label {{math|{{bra|''m''}}}} is its [[conjugate transpose]] (which is a row vector), and writing bras, kets, and linear operators next to each other implies [[matrix multiplication]].&lt;ref name="Bra-Ket Notation Trivializes Matrix Multiplication"&gt;[http://algassert.com/post/1629 Gidney, Craig (2017). Bra–Ket Notation Trivializes Matrix Multiplication]&lt;/ref&gt; However, kets may also exist in uncountably-infinite-dimensional vector spaces, such that they cannot be literally written as a column vector. Also, writing a column vector as a list of numbers requires picking a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]], whereas one can write "{{math|{{ket|''m''}}}}" without committing to any particular basis. This is helpful because quantum mechanics calculations involve frequently switching between different bases (e.g. position basis, momentum basis, energy eigenbasis, etc.), so it is better to have the basis vectors (if any) written out explicitly.  In some situations involving two important basis vectors they will be referred to simply as "{{math|{{ket|''-''}}}}" and "{{math|{{ket|''+''}}}}".

The standard mathematical notation for the [[inner product]], preferred as well by some physicists, expresses exactly the same thing as the bra–ket notation,

:&lt;math&gt;(\phi,\psi) = \langle\phi{\mid}\psi\rangle = \bigl(\langle\phi|\bigr) \,  \bigl(|\psi\rangle\bigr),&lt;/math&gt;

Bras and kets can also be configured in other ways, such as the [[outer product]]

:&lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle\langle\phi|&lt;/math&gt;

which can also be represented as a matrix multiplication (i.e., a column vector times a row vector equals a matrix).

If the ket is an element of a vector space, the bra is technically an element of its [[dual space]]—see [[Riesz representation theorem]].

==Vector spaces==

===Vectors vs kets===

In mathematics, the term "vector" is used to refer generally to any element of any vector space. In physics, however, the term "vector" is much more specific: "Vector" refers almost exclusively to quantities like [[displacement (vector)|displacement]] or [[velocity]], which have three components that relate directly to the three dimensions of the real world. Such vectors are typically denoted with over arrows ({{math|{{vec|''r''}}}}) or boldface ({{math|'''r'''}}).

In quantum mechanics, a [[quantum state]] is typically represented as an element of an abstract complex vector space—for example the infinite-dimensional vector space of all possible [[wavefunction]]s (functions mapping each point of 3D space to a complex number). Since the term "vector" is already used for something else (see previous paragraph), it is very common to refer to these elements of abstract complex vector spaces as "kets", and to write them using ket notation.

===Ket notation===

Ket notation, invented by Dirac, uses vertical bars and angular brackets: {{math|{{ket|''A''}}}}. When this notation is used, these quantities are called "kets", and {{math|{{ket|''A''}}}} is read as "ket-A".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Quantum Mechanics Demystified |first=D. |last=McMahon |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=2006 |isbn=0-07-145546-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; These kets can be manipulated using the usual rules of linear algebra, for example:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
|A \rangle &amp;= |B\rangle + |C\rangle \\
|C \rangle &amp;= (-1+2i)|D \rangle \\
|D \rangle &amp;= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} |x\rangle \, \mathrm{d}x \,.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Note how any symbols, letters, numbers, or even words—whatever serves as a convenient label—can be used as the label inside a ket. For example, the last line above involves infinitely many different kets, one for each real number {{math|''x''}}. In other words, the symbol "{{math|{{ket|''A''}}}}" has a specific and universal mathematical meaning, while just the "{{math|''A''}}" by itself does not. For example, {{math|{{ket|1}} + {{ket|2}}}} might or might not be equal to {{math|{{ket|3}}}}. Nevertheless, for convenience, there is usually some logical scheme behind the labels inside kets, such as the common practice of labeling [[stationary state|energy eigenkets]] in quantum mechanics through a listing of their [[quantum number]]s.

===Inner products and bras===
{{main article|Inner product}}
An [[inner product]] is a generalization of the [[dot product]]. The inner product of two vectors is a scalar. In neutral notation (notation dedicated to the inner product ''only''), this might be written {{math|(''A'', ''B'')}}, where {{math|''A''}} and {{math|''B''}} are elements of the abstract vector space, i.e. both are ''kets''.

Bra–ket notation uses a specific notation for inner products:

:&lt;math&gt; (A, B) = \langle A | B \rangle = \text{the inner product of ket } | A \rangle \text{ with ket } | B \rangle&lt;/math&gt;

Bra–ket notation splits this inner product (also called a "bracket") into two pieces, the "bra" and the "ket":

:&lt;math&gt; \langle A | B \rangle = \bigl( \langle A | \bigr) \, \bigl( | B \rangle \bigr)&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|{{bra|''A''}}}} is called a bra, read as "bra-A", and {{math|{{ket|''B''}}}} is a ket as above.

The purpose of "splitting" the inner product into a bra and a ket is that ''both'' the bra {{math|{{bra|''A''}}}} and the ket {{math|{{ket|''B''}}}} are meaningful ''on their own'', and can be used in other contexts besides within an inner product. There are two main ways to think about the meanings of separate bras and kets. Accordingly, the interpretation of the expression {{math|{{bra-ket|''A''|''B''}}}} has a second interpretation, namely that of the action of a [[linear functional]] per below.

====Bras and kets as row and column vectors====
For a finite-dimensional vector space, using a fixed [[orthonormal basis]], the inner product can be written as a [[matrix multiplication]] of a row vector with a column vector:
:&lt;math&gt; \langle A | B \rangle \doteq A_1^* B_1 + A_2^* B_2 + \cdots + A_N^* B_N =
\begin{pmatrix} A_1^* &amp; A_2^* &amp; \cdots &amp; A_N^* \end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix} B_1 \\ B_2 \\ \vdots \\ B_N \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
Based on this, the bras and kets can be defined as:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \langle A | &amp;\doteq \begin{pmatrix} A_1^* &amp; A_2^* &amp; \cdots &amp; A_N^* \end{pmatrix} \\
| B \rangle &amp;\doteq \begin{pmatrix} B_1 \\ B_2 \\ \vdots \\ B_N \end{pmatrix} \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
and then it is understood that a bra next to a ket implies [[matrix multiplication]].

The [[conjugate transpose]] (also called ''Hermitian conjugate'') of a bra is the corresponding ket and vice versa:
:&lt;math&gt;\langle A |^\dagger = |A \rangle, \quad |A \rangle^\dagger = \langle A |&lt;/math&gt;
because if one starts with the bra
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} A_1^* &amp; A_2^* &amp; \cdots &amp; A_N^* \end{pmatrix} \,,&lt;/math&gt;
then performs a [[complex conjugation]], and then a [[matrix transpose]], one ends up with the ket
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} A_1 \\ A_2 \\ \vdots \\ A_N \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

====Bras as linear functionals====

A more abstract definition, which is equivalent but more easily generalized to infinite-dimensional spaces, is to say that bras are [[linear functional]]s on the space of kets, i.e. linear transformations that input a ket and output a complex number. The bra linear functionals are defined to be consistent with the inner product. Thus, if {{math|{{bra|''A''}}}} is the linear functional corresponding to {{math|{{ket|''A''}}}} under the [[Riesz representation theorem]], then

:&lt;math&gt;\langle A | B \rangle = \langle A|\bigl(|B\rangle\bigr)\,,&lt;/math&gt;

i.e. it produces ''the same'' complex number as the inner product does. The terminology for the right hand side is though ''not'' inner product, which always involves two ''kets''. Confusing this is harmless, since the same number is produced in the end.

In mathematics terminology, the [[vector space]] of bras is the [[dual space]] to the vector space of kets, and corresponding bras and kets are related by the [[Riesz representation theorem]].

=== Non-normalizable states and non-Hilbert spaces ===

Bra–ket notation can be used even if the vector space is not a [[Hilbert space]].

In quantum mechanics, it is common practice to write down kets which have infinite [[norm (mathematics)|norm]], i.e. non-[[normalizable wavefunction]]s. Examples include states whose [[wavefunction]]s are [[Dirac delta function]]s or infinite [[plane wave]]s. These do not, technically, belong to the [[Hilbert space]] itself. However, the definition of "Hilbert space" can be broadened to accommodate these states (see the [[Gelfand–Naimark–Segal construction]] or [[rigged Hilbert space]]s). The bra–ket notation continues to work in an analogous way in this broader context.

[[Banach space]]s are a different generalization of Hilbert spaces. In a Banach space {{math|{{mathcal|B}}}}, the vectors may be notated by kets and the continuous [[linear functional]]s by bras. Over any vector space without [[topology]], we may also notate the vectors by kets and the linear functionals by bras. In these more general contexts, the bracket does not have the meaning of an inner product, because the Riesz representation theorem does not apply.

==Usage in quantum mechanics==

The mathematical structure of [[quantum mechanics]] is based in large part on [[linear algebra]]:
*[[Wave function]]s and other [[quantum state]]s can be represented as vectors in a complex [[Hilbert space]]. (The exact structure of this Hilbert space depends on the situation.) In bra–ket notation, for example, an electron might be in the "state" {{math|{{ket|''ψ''}}}}. (Technically, the quantum states are ''[[ray (geometry)|ray]]s'' of vectors in the Hilbert space, as {{math|''c''{{ket|''ψ''}}}} corresponds to the same state for any nonzero complex number {{math|''c''}}.)
*[[Quantum superposition]]s can be described as vector sums of the constituent states. For example, an electron in the state {{math|{{ket|1}} + ''i'' {{ket|2}}}} is in a quantum superposition of the states {{math|{{ket|1}}}} and {{math|{{ket|2}}}}.
*[[Measurement in quantum mechanics|Measurements]] are associated with [[linear operator]]s (called [[observable]]s) on the Hilbert space of quantum states.
*Dynamics are also described by linear operators on the Hilbert space. For example, in the [[Schrödinger picture]], there is a linear [[time evolution]] operator {{math|''U''}} with the property that if an electron is in state {{math|{{ket|''ψ''}}}} right now, at a later time it will be in the state {{math|''U''{{ket|''ψ''}}}}, the same {{math|''U''}} for every possible {{math|{{ket|''ψ''}}}}.
*[[Normalizable wave function|Wave function normalization]] is scaling a wave function so that its [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] is 1.

Since virtually every calculation in quantum mechanics involves vectors and linear operators, it can involve, and often does involve, bra–ket notation. A few examples follow:

===Spinless position–space wave function===
  {{multiple image
   | left
   | footer    = Components of complex vectors plotted against index number; discrete {{math|''k''}} and continuous {{math|''x''}}. Two particular components out of infinitely many are highlighted.

   | width2    = 230
   | image2    = Continuous complex vector components.svg
   | caption2  = Continuous components {{math|''ψ''(''x'')}} of a complex vector {{math|{{ket|''ψ''}} {{=}} ∫ d''x'' ''ψ''(''x''){{ket|''x''}}}}, which belongs to an ''uncountably infinite''-dimensional [[Hilbert space]]; there are infinitely many {{math|''x''}} values and basis vectors {{math|{{ket|''x''}}}}.
  }}

The Hilbert space of a [[spin (physics)|spin]]-0 point particle is spanned by a "position [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]]" {{math|{ {{ket|'''r'''}} &lt;nowiki&gt;}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}, where the label {{math|'''r'''}} extends over the set of all points in [[position space]]. This label is the eigenvalue of the position operator acting on such a basis state, &lt;math&gt; \hat{\mathbf{r}}|\mathbf{r}\rangle =   \mathbf{r}|\mathbf{r}\rangle &lt;/math&gt;.  Since there are an [[uncountably infinite]] number of vector components in the basis, this is an uncountably infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. The dimensions of the Hilbert space (usually infinite) and position space (usually 1, 2 or 3) are not to be conflated.

Starting from any ket {{math|{{ket|Ψ}}}} in this Hilbert space,  one may ''define'' a complex scalar function of {{math|'''r'''}}, known as a [[wavefunction]],
:&lt;math&gt;\Psi(\mathbf{r}) \ \stackrel{\text{def}}{=}\ \lang \mathbf{r}|\Psi\rang \,.&lt;/math&gt;

On the left-hand side, {{math|Ψ('''r''')}} is a function mapping any point in space to a complex number; on the right-hand side, {{math|{{ket|Ψ}} {{=}} ∫ d&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;'''r''' Ψ('''r''') {{ket|'''r'''}}}} is a ket consisting of a superposition of kets with relative coefficients specified by that function.

It is then customary to define linear operators acting on wavefunctions in terms of linear operators acting on kets, by
:&lt;math&gt;A \Psi(\mathbf{r}) \ \stackrel{\text{def}}{=}\ \lang \mathbf{r}|A|\Psi\rang \,.&lt;/math&gt;

For instance, the [[momentum]] operator {{math|'''p'''}} has the following form,
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p} \Psi(\mathbf{r}) \ \stackrel{\text{def}}{=}\ \lang \mathbf{r} |\mathbf{p}|\Psi\rang = - i \hbar \nabla \Psi(\mathbf{r}) \,.&lt;/math&gt;

One occasionally encounters an expression such as
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla |\Psi\rang \,,&lt;/math&gt;
though this is something of an [[abuse of notation]]. The differential operator must be understood to be an abstract operator, acting on kets, that has the effect of differentiating wavefunctions once the expression is projected into the position basis,
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \lang\mathbf{r}|\Psi\rang \,,&lt;/math&gt;
even though, in the momentum basis, the operator amounts to a mere multiplication operator (by {{math|''iħ'''''p'''}}).

===Overlap of states===
In quantum mechanics the expression {{math|{{bra-ket|''φ''|''ψ''}}}} is typically interpreted as the [[probability amplitude]] for the state {{math|''ψ''}} to [[wavefunction collapse|collapse]] into the state {{math|''φ''}}. Mathematically, this means the coefficient for the projection of {{math|''ψ''}} onto {{math|''φ''}}.  It is also described as the projection of state {{math|''ψ''}} onto state {{math|''φ''}}.

===Changing basis for a spin-{{sfrac|1|2}} particle===
A stationary [[spin-½|spin-{{sfrac|1|2}}]] particle has a two-dimensional Hilbert space. One [[orthonormal basis]] is:
:&lt;math&gt;|{\uparrow}_z \rangle \,, \; |{\downarrow}_z \rangle&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|{{ket|↑&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt;}}}} is the state with a definite value of the [[angular momentum operator|spin operator {{math|''S&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;''}}]] equal to +{{sfrac|1|2}} and  {{math|{{ket|↓&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt;}}}} is the state with a definite value of the [[angular momentum operator|spin operator {{math|''S&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;''}}]] equal to −{{sfrac|1|2}}.

Since these are a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]], ''any'' [[quantum state]] of the particle can be expressed as a [[linear combination]] (i.e., [[quantum superposition]]) of these two states:
:&lt;math&gt;|\psi \rangle = a_{\psi} |{\uparrow}_z \rangle + b_{\psi} |{\downarrow}_z \rangle&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''a&lt;sub&gt;ψ&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and {{math|''b&lt;sub&gt;ψ&lt;/sub&gt;''}} are complex numbers.

A ''different'' basis for the same Hilbert space is:
:&lt;math&gt;|{\uparrow}_x \rangle \,, \; |{\downarrow}_x \rangle&lt;/math&gt;
defined in terms of {{math|''S&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''}} rather than {{math|''S&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;''}}.

Again, ''any'' state of the particle can be expressed as a linear combination of these two:
:&lt;math&gt;|\psi \rangle = c_{\psi} |{\uparrow}_x \rangle + d_{\psi} |{\downarrow}_x \rangle&lt;/math&gt;

In vector form, you might write
:&lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle \doteq \begin{pmatrix} a_\psi \\ b_\psi \end{pmatrix} \quad \text{or} \quad |\psi\rangle \doteq \begin{pmatrix} c_\psi \\ d_\psi \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;
depending on which basis you are using. In other words, the "coordinates" of a vector depend on the basis used.

There is a mathematical relationship between {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;ψ&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''b''&lt;sub&gt;ψ&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''c''&lt;sub&gt;ψ&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''d''&lt;sub&gt;ψ&lt;/sub&gt;}}; see [[change of basis]].

===Misleading uses===
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}

There are a few conventions and abuses of notation that are generally accepted by the physics community, but which might confuse the non-initiated.

It is common to use the same symbol for ''labels'' and ''constants'' in the same equation. For example, {{math|''α̂'' {{ket|''α''}} {{=}} ''α'' {{ket|''α''}}}}, where the symbol {{math|''α''}} is used '''simultaneously''' as the ''name of the operator'' {{math|''α̂''}}, its ''eigenvector'' {{math|{{ket|''α''}}}} and the associated ''eigenvalue'' {{math|''α''}}.

Something similar occurs in component notation of vectors. While {{math|''Ψ''}} (uppercase) is traditionally associated with wavefunctions, {{math|''ψ''}} (lowercase) may be used to denote a ''label'', a ''wave function'' or ''complex constant'' in the same context, usually differentiated only by a subscript.

The main abuses are including operations inside the vector labels. This is done for a fast notation of scaling vectors. E.g. if the vector {{math|{{ket|''α''}}}} is scaled by {{sqrt|2}}, it might be denoted by {{math|{{ket|''α''/{{sqrt|2}}}}}}, which makes no sense since {{math|''α''}} is a label, not a function or a number, so you can't perform operations on it.

This is especially common when denoting vectors as tensor products, where part of the labels are moved '''outside''' the designed slot, e.g. {{math|{{ket|''α''}} {{=}} {{ket|''α''/{{sqrt|2}}&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} ⊗ {{ket|''α''/{{sqrt|2}}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}}}. Here part of the labeling that should state that all three vectors are different was moved outside the kets, as subscripts 1 and 2. And a further abuse occurs, since {{math|''α''}} is meant to refer to the norm of the first vector—which is a ''label'' denoting a ''value''.

==Linear operators==
{{see also|Linear operator}}

===Linear operators acting on kets===

A [[linear operator]] is a map that inputs a ket and outputs a ket. (In order to be called "linear", it is required to have [[linear operator|certain properties]].) In other words, if {{math|'''''A'''''}} is a linear operator and {{math|{{ket|''ψ''}}}} is a ket, then {{math|'''''A'''''{{ket|''ψ''}}}} is another ket.

In an {{math|''N''}}-dimensional Hilbert space, {{math|{{ket|''ψ''}}}} can be written as an {{math|''N'' × 1}} [[column vector]], and then {{math|'''''A'''''}} is an {{math|''N'' × ''N''}} matrix with complex entries. The ket {{math|'''''A'''''{{ket|''ψ''}}}} can be computed by normal [[matrix multiplication]].

Linear operators are ubiquitous in the theory of quantum mechanics. For example, observable physical quantities are represented by [[self-adjoint operator]]s, such as [[energy]] or [[momentum]], whereas transformative processes are represented by [[unitary operator|unitary]] linear operators such as rotation or the progression of time.

===Linear operators acting on bras===

Operators can also be viewed as acting on bras ''from the right hand side''. Specifically, if {{math|'''''A'''''}} is a linear operator and {{math|{{bra|''φ''}}}} is a bra, then {{math|{{bra|''φ''}}'''''A'''''}} is another bra defined by the rule

:&lt;math&gt;\bigl(\langle\phi|\boldsymbol{A}\bigr) |\psi\rangle = \langle\phi| \bigl(\boldsymbol{A}|\psi\rangle\bigr) \,,&lt;/math&gt;

(in other words, a [[function composition]]). This expression is commonly written as (cf. [[energy inner product]])

:&lt;math&gt;\langle\phi|\boldsymbol{A}|\psi\rangle \,.&lt;/math&gt;

In an {{math|''N''}}-dimensional Hilbert space, {{math|{{bra|''φ''}}}} can be written as a {{math|1 × ''N''}} [[row vector]], and {{math|'''''A'''''}} (as in the previous section) is an {{math|''N'' × ''N''}} matrix. Then the bra {{math|{{bra|''φ''}}'''''A'''''}} can be computed by normal [[matrix multiplication]].

If the same state vector appears on both bra and ket side,
:&lt;math&gt;\langle\psi|\boldsymbol{A}|\psi\rangle \,,&lt;/math&gt;
then this expression gives the [[expectation value (quantum mechanics)|expectation value]], or mean or average value, of the observable represented by operator {{math|'''''A'''''}} for the physical system in the state {{math|{{ket|''ψ''}}}}.

===Outer products===

A convenient way to define linear operators on a Hilbert space {{math|{{mathcal|H}}}} is given by the [[outer product]]: if {{math|{{bra|''ϕ''}}}} is a bra and {{math|{{ket|''ψ''}}}} is a ket, the outer product
:&lt;math&gt; |\phi\rang \, \lang \psi| &lt;/math&gt;
denotes the [[finite-rank operator|rank-one operator]] with the rule 
:&lt;math&gt; \bigl(|\phi\rang \lang \psi|\bigr)(x) = \lang \psi | x \rang |\phi \rang&lt;/math&gt;.

For a finite-dimensional vector space, the outer product can be understood as simple matrix multiplication:
:&lt;math&gt; |\phi \rangle \, \langle \psi | \doteq 
\begin{pmatrix} \phi_1 \\ \phi_2 \\ \vdots \\ \phi_N \end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix} \psi_1^* &amp; \psi_2^* &amp; \cdots &amp; \psi_N^* \end{pmatrix}
= \begin{pmatrix}
\phi_1 \psi_1^* &amp; \phi_1 \psi_2^* &amp; \cdots &amp; \phi_1 \psi_N^* \\
\phi_2 \psi_1^* &amp; \phi_2 \psi_2^* &amp; \cdots &amp; \phi_2 \psi_N^* \\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
\phi_N \psi_1^* &amp; \phi_N \psi_2^* &amp; \cdots &amp; \phi_N \psi_N^* \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
The outer product is an {{math|''N'' × ''N''}} matrix, as expected for a linear operator.

One of the uses of the outer product is to construct [[projection operator]]s. Given a ket {{math|{{ket|''ψ''}}}} of norm 1, the orthogonal projection onto the [[Linear subspace|subspace]] spanned by {{math|{{ket|''ψ''}}}} is
:&lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle \, \langle\psi| \,.&lt;/math&gt;

===Hermitian conjugate operator===
{{main article|Hermitian conjugate}}
Just as kets and bras can be transformed into each other (making {{math|{{ket|''ψ''}}}} into {{math|{{bra|''ψ''}}}}), the element from the dual space corresponding to {{math|''A''{{ket|''ψ''}}}} is {{math|{{bra|''ψ''}}''A''&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;}},  where {{math|''A''&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;}} denotes the [[Hermitian conjugate]] (or adjoint) of the operator {{math|''A''}}. In other words,
:&lt;math&gt; |\phi\rangle = A |\psi\rangle \quad \text{if and only if} \quad \langle\phi| = \langle \psi | A^\dagger \,.&lt;/math&gt;

If {{math|''A''}} is expressed as an {{math|''N'' × ''N''}} matrix, then {{math|''A''&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;}} is its [[conjugate transpose]].

[[Self-adjoint]] operators, where {{math|''A'' {{=}} ''A''&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;}}, play an important role in quantum mechanics; for example, an [[observable]] is always described by a self-adjoint operator. If {{mvar|A}} is a self-adjoint operator, then {{math|{{bra|''ψ''}}''A''{{ket|''ψ''}}}} is always a real number (not complex). This implies that [[Expectation value (quantum mechanics)|expectation values]] of observables are real.

==Properties==
Bra–ket notation was designed to facilitate the formal manipulation of linear-algebraic expressions. Some of the properties that allow this manipulation are listed herein. In what follows, {{math|''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} denote arbitrary [[complex number]]s, {{math|''c''*}} denotes the [[complex conjugate]] of {{math|''c''}}, {{math|''A''}} and {{math|''B''}} denote arbitrary linear operators, and these properties are to hold for any choice of bras and kets.

===Linearity===
* Since bras are linear functionals,

::&lt;math&gt;\langle\phi| \bigl( c_1|\psi_1\rangle + c_2|\psi_2\rangle \bigr) = c_1\langle\phi|\psi_1\rangle + c_2\langle\phi|\psi_2\rangle \,. &lt;/math&gt;

* By the definition of addition and scalar multiplication of linear functionals in the [[dual space]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://bohr.physics.berkeley.edu/classes/221/1112/notes/hilbert.pdf Lecture notes by Robert Littlejohn], eqns 12 and 13&lt;/ref&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\bigl(c_1 \langle\phi_1| + c_2 \langle\phi_2|\bigr) |\psi\rangle = c_1 \langle\phi_1|\psi\rangle + c_2 \langle\phi_2|\psi\rangle \,. &lt;/math&gt;

===Associativity===
Given any expression involving complex numbers, bras, kets, inner products, outer products, and/or linear operators (but not addition), written in bra–ket notation, the parenthetical groupings do not matter (i.e., the [[associative property]] holds). For example:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\lang \psi| \bigl(A |\phi\rang\bigr) = \bigl(\lang \psi|A\bigr)|\phi\rang \, &amp;\stackrel{\text{def}}{=} \, \lang \psi | A | \phi \rang \\
\bigl(A|\psi\rang\bigr)\lang \phi| = A\bigl(|\psi\rang \lang \phi|\bigr) \, &amp;\stackrel{\text{def}}{=} \, A | \psi \rang \lang \phi |
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
and so forth. The expressions on the right (with no parentheses whatsoever) are allowed to be written unambiguously ''because'' of the equalities on the left. Note that the associative property does ''not'' hold for expressions that include nonlinear operators, such as the [[antilinear]] [[T-symmetry|time reversal operator]] in physics.

===Hermitian conjugation===
Bra–ket notation makes it particularly easy to compute the Hermitian conjugate (also called ''dagger'', and denoted {{math|†}}) of expressions. The formal rules are:
* The Hermitian conjugate of a bra is the corresponding ket, and vice versa.
* The Hermitian conjugate of a complex number is its complex conjugate.
* The Hermitian conjugate of the Hermitian conjugate of anything (linear operators, bras, kets, numbers) is itself—i.e.,
::&lt;math&gt;\left(x^\dagger\right)^\dagger=x \,.&lt;/math&gt;
* Given any combination of complex numbers, bras, kets, inner products, outer products, and/or linear operators, written in bra–ket notation, its Hermitian conjugate can be computed by reversing the order of the components, and taking the Hermitian conjugate of each.

These rules are sufficient to formally write the Hermitian conjugate of any such expression; some examples are as follows:
* Kets:
::&lt;math&gt;
\bigl(c_1|\psi_1\rangle + c_2|\psi_2\rangle\bigr)^\dagger = c_1^* \langle\psi_1| + c_2^* \langle\psi_2| \,.
&lt;/math&gt;
* Inner products:
::&lt;math&gt;\langle \phi | \psi \rangle^* = \langle \psi|\phi\rangle \,.&lt;/math&gt;

:Note that {{math|{{bra-ket|''φ''|''ψ''}}}} is a scalar, so the Hermitian conjugate is just the complex conjugate, i.e.
::&lt;math&gt;\bigl(\langle \phi | \psi \rangle\bigr)^\dagger = \langle \phi | \psi \rangle^*&lt;/math&gt;
* Matrix elements:
::&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\langle \phi| A | \psi \rangle^* &amp;= \left\langle \psi \left| A^\dagger \right|\phi \right\rangle \\
\left\langle \phi\left| A^\dagger B^\dagger \right| \psi \right\rangle^* &amp;= \langle \psi | BA |\phi \rangle \,.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
* Outer products:
::&lt;math&gt;\Big(\bigl(c_1|\phi_1\rangle\langle \psi_1|\bigr) + \bigl(c_2|\phi_2\rangle\langle\psi_2|\bigr)\Big)^\dagger = \bigl(c_1^* |\psi_1\rangle\langle \phi_1|\bigr) + \bigl(c_2^*|\psi_2\rangle\langle\phi_2|\bigr) \,.&lt;/math&gt;

==Composite bras and kets==
Two Hilbert spaces {{math|''V''}} and {{math|''W''}} may form a third space {{math|''V'' ⊗ ''W''}} by a [[tensor product]]. In quantum mechanics, this is used for describing composite systems. If a system is composed of two subsystems described in {{math|''V''}} and {{math|''W''}} respectively, then the Hilbert space of the entire system is the tensor product of the two spaces. (The exception to this is if the subsystems are actually [[identical particles]]. In that case, the situation is a little more complicated.)

If {{math|{{ket|''ψ''}}}} is a ket in {{math|''V''}} and {{math|{{ket|''φ''}}}} is a ket in {{math|''W''}}, the direct product of the two kets is a ket in {{math|''V'' ⊗ ''W''}}. This is written in various notations:
:&lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle|\phi\rangle \,,\quad |\psi\rangle \otimes |\phi\rangle\,,\quad|\psi \phi\rangle\,,\quad|\psi ,\phi\rangle\,.&lt;/math&gt;

See [[quantum entanglement#Quantum mechanical framework|quantum entanglement]] and the [[EPR paradox#Mathematical formulation|EPR paradox]] for applications of this product.

==The unit operator==
Consider a complete [[orthonormal]] system (''[[Basis (linear algebra)|basis]]''),
:&lt;math&gt;\{ e_i \ | \ i \in \mathbb{N} \} \,,&lt;/math&gt;
for a Hilbert space {{math|''H''}}, with respect to the norm from an inner product {{math|{{angbr|·,·}}}}. 

From basic [[functional analysis]], it is  known that any ket {{math|{{ket|''ψ''}}}} can also be written as
:&lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle = \sum_{i \in \mathbb{N}} \langle e_i | \psi \rangle | e_i \rangle,&lt;/math&gt;
with {{math|{{bra-ket|·|·}}}} the inner product on the Hilbert space.

From the commutativity of kets with (complex) scalars, it follows that
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i \in \mathbb{N}} | e_i \rangle \langle e_i | = 1\!\! 1&lt;/math&gt;
must be the ''identity operator'', which sends each vector to itself. 

This, then,  can be inserted in any expression without affecting its value; for example
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\langle v | w \rangle &amp;= \langle v | \left( \sum_{i \in \mathbb{N}} | e_i \rangle \langle e_i| \right) | w \rangle \\
                      &amp;= \langle v | \left( \sum_{i \in \mathbb{N}} | e_i \rangle \langle e_i| \right) \left( \sum_{j \in \mathbb{N}} | e_j \rangle \langle e_j |\right)| w \rangle \\
&amp;= \langle v | e_i \rangle \langle e_i | e_j \rangle \langle e_j | w \rangle \,, 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where, in the last identity, the [[Einstein summation convention]] has been used.

In [[quantum mechanics]], it often occurs that little or no information about the inner product {{math|{{bra-ket|''ψ''|''φ''}}}} of two arbitrary (state) kets is present, while it is still possible to say something about the expansion coefficients {{math|{{bra-ket|''ψ''|''e&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} {{=}} {{bra-ket|''e&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''|''ψ''}}*}} and {{math|{{bra-ket|''e&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''|''φ''}}}} of those vectors with respect to a specific (orthonormalized) basis. In this case, it is particularly useful to insert the unit operator into the bracket one time or more.

For more information, see [[Resolution of the identity]], 
*   &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; {{math|1 {{=}} ∫ d''x'' {{ket|''x''}}{{bra|''x''}} {{=}} ∫ d''p'' {{ket|''p''}}{{bra|''p''}}}},  where  {{math| {{ket|''p''}} {{=}} ∫ d''x'' ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''ixp''/''ħ''&lt;/sup&gt;{{ket|''x''}}/{{sqrt|2''πħ''}}}}.  

Since {{math|{{bra-ket|''x''′|''x''}} {{=}} ''δ''(''x'' − ''x''′)}}, plane waves follow, {{math|{{bra-ket|''x''|''p''}} {{=}} ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''ixp''/''ħ''&lt;/sup&gt;/{{sqrt|2''πħ''}}}}.&lt;ref&gt;In his book (1958), Ch. III.20, Dirac defines the ''standard ket'' which, up to a normalization,  is the translationally invariant momentum eigenstate &lt;math&gt;|\varpi\rangle=\lim_{p\to 0} |p\rangle&lt;/math&gt; in the momentum representation, i.e.,  &lt;math&gt;\hat{p}|\varpi\rangle=0&lt;/math&gt;. Consequently, the corresponding wavefunction is a constant,   &lt;math&gt; \langle x|\varpi\rangle  \sqrt{2\pi \hbar}=1&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;|x\rangle= \delta(\hat{x}-x) |\varpi\rangle  \sqrt{2\pi \hbar}&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, when all matrix elements of an operator such as 
:&lt;math&gt; \langle x|   A |y\rangle   &lt;/math&gt;
are available,
this resolution serves to reconstitute the full operator,
:&lt;math&gt; \int dx dy ~~ |x\rangle \langle x|   A |y\rangle \langle y | =  A ~.   &lt;/math&gt;

== Notation used by mathematicians ==

The object physicists are considering when using bra–ket notation is a [[Hilbert space]] (a [[Complete metric space|complete]] [[inner product space]]).

Let {{math|{{mathcal|H}}}} be a Hilbert space and {{math|''h'' ∈ {{mathcal|H}}}} a vector in {{math|{{mathcal|H}}}}. What physicists would denote by {{math|{{ket|''h''}}}} is the vector itself. That is,

:&lt;math&gt; |h\rangle\in \mathcal{H} &lt;/math&gt;.

Let {{math|{{mathcal|H}}*}} be the [[dual space]] of {{math|{{mathcal|H}}}}. This is the space of linear functionals on {{math|{{mathcal|H}}}}. The isomorphism {{math|''Φ'' : {{mathcal|H}} → {{mathcal|H}}*}} is defined by {{math|''Φ''(''h'') {{=}} ''φ&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, where for every {{math|''g'' ∈ {{mathcal|H}}}} we define
:&lt;math&gt; \phi_h(g) = \mbox{IP}(h,g) = (h,g) = \langle h,g \rangle = \langle h|g \rangle &lt;/math&gt;,
where {{math|IP(·,·)}}, {{math|(·,·)}}, {{math|{{angbr|·,·}}}} and {{math|{{bra-ket|·|·}}}} are just different notations for expressing an inner product between two elements in a Hilbert space (or for the first three, in any inner product space). Notational confusion arises when identifying {{math|''φ&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and {{math|''g''}} with {{math|{{bra|''h''}}}} and {{math|{{ket|''g''}}}} respectively. This is because of literal symbolic substitutions. Let {{math|''φ&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ''H'' {{=}} {{bra|''h''}}}} and let {{math|''g'' {{=}} G {{=}} {{ket|''g''}}}}. This gives

:&lt;math&gt; \phi_h(g) = H(g) = H(G)=\langle h|(G) = \langle h|\bigl(|g\rangle\bigr) \,. &lt;/math&gt;

One ignores the parentheses and removes the double bars. Some properties of this notation are convenient since we are dealing with linear operators and composition acts like a [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]] multiplication.

Moreover, mathematicians usually write the dual entity not at the first place, as the physicists do, but at the second one, and they usually use not an [[asterisk]] but an overline (which the physicists reserve for averages and the [[Dirac_equation#Conservation_of_probability_current|Dirac spinor adjoint]]) to denote [[complex conjugate]] numbers; i.e., for scalar products mathematicians usually write
:&lt;math&gt;(\phi ,\psi )=\int \phi (x)\cdot \overline{\psi(x)}\, \mathrm{d}x \,,&lt;/math&gt;
whereas physicists would write for the same quantity
:&lt;math&gt; \langle\psi |\phi \rangle=\int \mathrm{d}x\,\psi^*(x)\cdot\phi(x)\,.&lt;/math&gt;

In mathematics, the '''center manifold''' of an [[equilibrium point]] of a [[dynamical system]] consists of [[Orbit (dynamics)|orbits]] whose behavior around the equilibrium point is not controlled by either the attraction of the [[stable manifold]] or the repulsion of the [[unstable manifold]]. The first step when studying equilibrium points of dynamical systems is to linearize the system. The [[eigenvectors]] corresponding to [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenvalues]] with negative real part form the stable [[eigenspace]], which gives rise to the stable manifold.  Similarly, eigenvalues with positive real part yield the unstable manifold.

This concludes the story if the equilibrium point is [[hyperbolic equilibrium point|hyperbolic]] (i.e., all eigenvalues of the linearization have nonzero real part). However, if there are eigenvalues whose real part is zero, then these give rise to the center manifold.  If the eigenvalues are precisely zero, rather than just real part being zero, then these more specifically give rise to a [[slow manifold]]. The behavior on the center (slow) manifold is generally not determined by the linearization and thus is more difficult to study.

Center manifolds play an important role in: [[bifurcation theory]] because  interesting behavior takes place on the center manifold; and [[multiscale mathematics]] because the long time dynamics often are attracted to a relatively simple center manifold.

== Definition ==

Let &lt;math&gt;\frac{d\textbf{x}}{dt} = \textbf{f}(\textbf{x})&lt;/math&gt; be a [[dynamical system]] with [[equilibrium point]] &lt;math&gt;\textbf{x}^*&lt;/math&gt;. The linearization of the system near the equilibrium point is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\textbf{x}}{dt} = A\textbf{x}, \quad \text{where } A = \frac{d\textbf{f}}{d\textbf{x}}(\textbf{x}^*). &lt;/math&gt;

The [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian matrix]] &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; defines three main subspaces:
* the stable subspace, which is spanned by the [[generalized eigenvector]]s corresponding to the eigenvalues &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Re}\lambda&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;;
* the unstable subspace, which is spanned by the generalized eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalues &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Re}\lambda&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;;
* the center subspace, which is spanned by the generalized eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalues &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Re}\lambda=0&lt;/math&gt;.
Depending upon the application, other subspaces of interest include  center-stable, center-unstable, sub-center, slow, and fast subspaces.
These subspaces are all [[invariant subspace]]s of the linearized equation.

Corresponding to the linearized system, the nonlinear system has [[invariant manifold]]s, each consisting of sets of orbits of the nonlinear system.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Guckenheimer|Holmes|1997}}, Section 3.2&lt;/ref&gt;
* An invariant manifold tangent to the stable subspace and with the same dimension is the [[stable manifold]]. 
* The unstable manifold is of the same dimension and tangent to the unstable subspace. 
* A center manifold is of the same dimension and tangent to the center subspace.  If, as is common, the eigenvalues of the center subspace are all precisely zero, rather than just real part zero, then a center manifold is often called a [[slow manifold]].

== Center manifold theorems ==

The center manifold existence theorem states that if the right-hand side function &lt;math&gt;\textbf{f}(\textbf{x})&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;C^r&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; times continuously differentiable), then at every equilibrium point there exists a neighborhood of some finite size in which there is at least one of &lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Guckenheimer|Holmes|1997}}, Theorem 3.2.1&lt;/ref&gt;
* a unique &lt;math&gt;C^r&lt;/math&gt; '''stable''' manifold,
* a unique &lt;math&gt;C^r&lt;/math&gt; '''unstable''' manifold, 
* and a (not necessarily unique) &lt;math&gt;C^{r-1}&lt;/math&gt; '''center''' manifold.

In example applications, a nonlinear coordinate transform to a [[normal form (bifurcation theory)|normal form]] can clearly separate these three manifolds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1=Murdock | first1=James | title=Normal forms and unfoldings for local dynamical systems | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | year=2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A web service [http://www.maths.adelaide.edu.au/anthony.roberts/sdenf.php] currently undertakes the necessary computer algebra for a range of finite-dimensional systems.

In the case when the unstable manifold does not exist, center manifolds are often relevant to modelling.
The center manifold emergence theorem then says that the neighborhood may be chosen so that all solutions of the system staying in the neighborhood tend exponentially quickly to some solution &lt;math&gt;\textbf{y}(t)&lt;/math&gt; on the center manifold.
That is, 
&lt;math&gt;\textbf{x}(t)=\textbf{y}(t)+\mathcal{O}(e^{-\beta' t}) \quad\text{as } 
    t\to\infty\,,&lt;/math&gt;
for some rate &lt;math&gt;\beta'&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Iooss, G.  |author2=Adelmeyer, M.|title = Topics in Bifurcation Theory|pages=7|year = 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This theorem asserts that for a wide variety of initial conditions the solutions of the full system decay exponentially quickly to a solution on the relatively low dimensional center manifold.

A third theorem, the approximation theorem, asserts that if an approximate expression for such invariant manifolds, say &lt;math&gt;\textbf{x}=\textbf{X}(\textbf{s})&lt;/math&gt;, satisfies the differential equation for the system to residuals &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}(|\textbf{s}|^p)&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;\textbf{s}\to\textbf{0}&lt;/math&gt;, then the invariant manifold is approximated by &lt;math&gt;\textbf{x}=\textbf{X}(\textbf{s})&lt;/math&gt; to an error of the same order, namely &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}(|\textbf{s}|^p)&lt;/math&gt;.

However, some applications, such as to shear dispersion, require an infinite-dimensional center manifold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=A. J. |last=Roberts |journal=J. Austral. Math. Soc. |series=B |pages=480–500 |title = The application of centre manifold theory to the evolution of systems which vary slowly in space |volume = 29 |year = 1988 |doi=10.1017/S0334270000005968 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most general and powerful theory was developed by Aulbach and Wanner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Aulbach |first=B. |last2=Wanner |first2=T. |year=1996 |chapter=Integral manifolds for Caratheodory type differential equations in Banach spaces |editor-first=B. |editor-last=Aulbach |editor2-first=F. |editor2-last=Colonius |title=Six Lectures on Dynamical Systems |publisher=World Scientific |location=Singapore |pages=45–119 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Aulbach |first=B. |last2=Wanner |first2=T. |year=1999 |chapter=Invariant foliations for Caratheodory type differential equations in Banach spaces |editor-first=V. |editor-last=Lakshmikantham |editor2-first=A.

Further, they usefully generalised the definition of the manifolds so that the center manifold is associated with eigenvalues such that &lt;math&gt;|\operatorname{Re}\lambda|\leq\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, the stable manifold with eigenvalues &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Re}\lambda\leq-\beta&lt;-r\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, and unstable manifold with eigenvalues  &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Re}\lambda\geq\beta&gt;r\alpha&lt;/math&gt;. They proved existence of these manifolds, and the emergence of a center manifold, via nonlinear coordinate transforms. Potzsche and Rasmussen established a corresponding approximation theorem for such infinite dimensional, non-autonomous systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Potzsche |first=C. |last2=Rasmussen |first2=M. |year=2006 |title=Taylor approximation of integral manifolds |journal=Journal of Dynamics and Differential Equations |volume=18 |issue= |pages=427–460 |doi=10.1007/s10884-006-9011-8 |bibcode = 2006JDDE...18..427P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Center manifold and the analysis of nonlinear systems==
As the stability of the equilibrium correlates with the "stability" of its manifolds, the existence of a center manifold brings up the question about the dynamics on the center manifold. This is analyzed by the [[center manifold reduction]], which, in combination with some system parameter μ, leads to the concepts of [[Bifurcation theory|bifurcations]].

Correspondingly, two web services currently undertake the necessary computer algebra to construct just the center manifold for a wide range of finite-dimensional systems (provided they are in multinomial form).  
* One web service [http://www.maths.adelaide.edu.au/anthony.roberts/sdesm.php] constructs [[slow manifold]]s for systems which are linearly diagonalised, but which may be non-autonomous or stochastic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = A.J. Roberts|journal = Physica A|pages = 12–38|title = Normal form transforms separate slow and fast modes in stochastic dynamical systems|volume = 387|year = 2008|doi=10.1016/j.physa.2007.08.023|arxiv = math/0701623 |bibcode = 2008PhyA..387...12R }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Another web service [http://www.maths.adelaide.edu.au/anthony.roberts/gencm.php] constructs center manifolds for systems with general linearisation, but only for autonomous systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = A.J. Roberts|journal = Computer Phys. Comm. |pages = 215–230|title = Low-dimensional modelling of dynamics via computer algebra|volume = 100|year = 1997|doi=10.1016/S0010-4655(96)00162-2|bibcode = 1997CoPhC.100..215R |arxiv = chao-dyn/9604012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
The Wikipedia entry on [[slow manifold]]s gives more examples.

===A simple example===
Consider the system
: &lt;math&gt; \dot x=x^2,\quad \dot y=y.&lt;/math&gt;
The unstable manifold at the origin is the ''y'' axis, and the stable manifold is the trivial set {(0,&amp;nbsp;0)}. Any orbit not on the stable manifold satisfies an equation on the form &lt;math&gt;y=Ae^{-1/x}&lt;/math&gt; for some real constant ''A''. It follows that for any real ''A'', we can create a center manifold by piecing together the curve &lt;math&gt;y=Ae^{-1/x}&lt;/math&gt; for ''x''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 with the negative ''x'' axis (including the origin). Moreover, all center manifolds have this potential non-uniqueness, although often the non-uniqueness only occurs in unphysical complex values of the variables.

===Delay differential equations often have Hopf bifurcations===
Another example shows how a center manifold
models the [[Hopf bifurcation]] that occurs
for parameter &lt;math&gt;a\approx 4&lt;/math&gt; in the
[[delay differential equation]]
&lt;math&gt;{dx}/{dt}=-ax(t-1)-2x^2-x^3&lt;/math&gt;.  
Strictly, the delay makes this DE infinite-dimensional.

Fortunately, we may approximate such delays by the following trick that keeps the dimensionality finite.
Define &lt;math&gt;u_1(t)=x(t)&lt;/math&gt;
and approximate the time delayed variable, 
&lt;math&gt;x(t-1)\approx u_3(t)&lt;/math&gt;, by using the intermediaries
&lt;math&gt;{du_2}/{dt}=2(u_1-u_2)&lt;/math&gt; and
&lt;math&gt;{du_3}/{dt}=2(u_2-u_3)&lt;/math&gt;.

For parameter near
critical, &lt;math&gt;a=4+\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, the [[delay differential equation]] is then approximated by the system
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d\textbf{u}}{dt} =\left[\begin{array}{ccc} 0&amp;0&amp;-4\\
2&amp;-2&amp;0\\ 0&amp;2&amp;-2 \end{array}\right] \textbf{u} +
\left[\begin{array}{c}-\alpha u_3-2u_1^2-u_1^3\\ 0\\
0\end{array}\right]. &lt;/math&gt;
Copying and pasting the appropriate entries, 
the web service [http://www.maths.adelaide.edu.au/anthony.roberts/gencm.php] finds that in terms of a [[complex amplitude]] &lt;math&gt;s(t)&lt;/math&gt; 
and its complex conjugate &lt;math&gt;\bar s(t)&lt;/math&gt;, the center manifold
:&lt;math&gt; \textbf{u}=\left[\begin{array}{c} e^{i2t}s+e^{-i2t}\bar s\\
 \frac{1-i}2e^{i2t}s +\frac{1+i}2e^{-i2t}\bar s\\
 -\frac{i}2e^{i2t}s +\frac{i}2e^{-i2t}\bar s 
\end{array}\right]
+{O}(\alpha+|s|^2) &lt;/math&gt;
and the evolution on the center manifold is
:&lt;math&gt;  \frac{ds}{dt}= \left[
\frac{1+2i}{10}\alpha s
-\frac{3+16i}{15}|s|^2s 
\right] +{ O}(\alpha^2+|s|^4)&lt;/math&gt;
This evolution shows the origin is linearly unstable for &lt;math&gt;\alpha&gt;0\ (a&gt;4)&lt;/math&gt;, but the cubic nonlinearity then stabilises nearby limit cycles as in classic [[Hopf bifurcation]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5770">A '''Choquet integral''' is a [[subadditive]] or [[superadditive]] integral created by the French mathematician [[Gustave Choquet]] in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=G. |last=Choquet |title=Theory of capacities |journal=Annales de l'Institut Fourier |volume=5 |year=1953 |issue= |pages=131–295 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was initially used in [[statistical mechanics]] and [[potential theory]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=D. |last=Denneberg |title=Non-additive measure and Integral |publisher=Kluwer Academic |year=1994 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but found its way into [[decision theory]] in the 1980s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Grabisch |first=M. |year=1996 |title=The application of fuzzy integrals in multicriteria decision making |journal=European Journal of Operational Research |volume=89 |issue=3 |pages=445–456 |doi=10.1016/0377-2217(95)00176-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; where it is used as a way of measuring the expected [[utility theory|utility]] of an uncertain event.  It is applied specifically to [[membership function (mathematics)|membership functions]] and [[Capacity of a set|capacities]]. In [[Imprecise probability|imprecise probability theory]], the Choquet integral is also used to calculate the lower expectation induced by a 2-monotone [[Upper and lower probabilities|lower probability]], or the upper expectation induced by a 2-alternating [[Upper and lower probabilities|upper probability]].

Using the Choquet integral to denote the expected utility of belief functions measured with capacities is a way to reconcile the [[Ellsberg paradox]] and the [[Allais paradox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chateauneuf |first=A. |last2=Cohen |first2=M.

K., Dhompongsa, S., &amp; Nguyen, H. T. (2010). Stochastic dominance and applications to finance, risk and economics. CRC Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The following notation is used:

* &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; - a set.
* &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; - a collection of subsets of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;. 
* &lt;math&gt;f : S\to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; - a function.
* &lt;math&gt;\nu : \mathcal{F}\to \mathbb{R}^+&lt;/math&gt; - a monotone [[set function]].

Assume that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is measurable with respect to &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt;, that is

:&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in\mathbb{R}\colon \{s | f (s) \geq x\}\in\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;

Then the Choquet integral of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; is defined by:

:&lt;math&gt;
(C)\int f d\nu :=
\int_{-\infty}^0
(\nu (\{s | f (s) \geq x\})-\nu(S))\, dx
+
\int^\infty_0
\nu (\{s | f (s) \geq x\})\, dx
&lt;/math&gt;

where the integrals on the right-hand side are the usual [[Riemann integral]] (the integrands are integrable because they are monotone in &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;).

==Properties==

In general the Choquet integral does not satisfy additivity. More specifically, if &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; is not a probability measure, it may hold that
:&lt;math&gt;\int f \,d\nu + \int g \,d\nu \neq \int (f + g)\, d\nu.&lt;/math&gt;

for some functions &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;.

The Choquet integral does satisfy the following properties.

===Monotonicity===
If &lt;math&gt;f\leq g&lt;/math&gt; then

:&lt;math&gt;(C)\int f\, d\nu \leq (C)\int g\, d\nu&lt;/math&gt;

===Positive homogeneity===

For all &lt;math&gt;\lambda\ge 0&lt;/math&gt; it holds that
:&lt;math&gt;(C)\int \lambda f \,d\nu = \lambda (C)\int f\, d\nu,&lt;/math&gt;

===Comonotone additivity===

If &lt;math&gt;f,g : S \rightarrow \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; are comonotone functions, that is, if for all &lt;math&gt;s,s' \in S&lt;/math&gt; it holds that
:&lt;math&gt;(f(s) - f(s')) (g(s) - g(s')) \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;.
then
:&lt;math&gt;(C)\int\, f d\nu + (C)\int g\, d\nu = (C)\int (f + g)\, d\nu.&lt;/math&gt;

===Subadditivity===

If &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; is 2-alternating,{{clarify|reason=What does 2-alternating mean?|date=July 2012}} then
:&lt;math&gt;(C)\int\, f d\nu + (C)\int g\, d\nu \ge (C)\int (f + g)\, d\nu.&lt;/math&gt;

===Superadditivity===

If &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; is 2-monotone,{{clarify|reason=What does 2-monotone mean?|date=July 2012}} then
:&lt;math&gt;(C)\int\, f d\nu + (C)\int g\, d\nu \le (C)\int (f + g)\, d\nu.&lt;/math&gt;

==Alternative representation==
Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; denote a [[cumulative distribution function]] such that &lt;math&gt;G^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;d H&lt;/math&gt; integrable. Then this following formula is often referred to as Choquet Integral:
:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^\infty G^{-1}(\alpha) d H(\alpha) = -\int_{-\infty}^a H(G(x))dx+ \int_a^\infty \hat{H}(1-G(x)) dx,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\hat{H}(x)=H(1)-H(1-x)&lt;/math&gt;.
* choose &lt;math&gt;H(x):=x&lt;/math&gt; to get &lt;math&gt;\int_0^1 G^{-1}(x)dx = E[X]&lt;/math&gt;,
* choose &lt;math&gt;H(x):=1_{[\alpha,x]}&lt;/math&gt; to get &lt;math&gt;\int_0^1 G^{-1}(x)dH(x)= G^{-1}(\alpha)&lt;/math&gt;

== Applications ==
The Choquet integral was applied in image processing, video processing and computer vision. In behavioral decision theory, Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman use the Choquet integral and related methods in their formulation of Cumulative Prospect Theory&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=A. |last=Tversky |last2=Kahneman |first2=D.|title=Advances in Prospect Theory: Cumulative Representation of Uncertainty |journal=Journal of Risk and Uncertainty  |volume=5 |year=1992 |issue= |pages=297-323 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Claude Lemaréchal''' is a [[France|French]] [[applied mathematician]], and former senior researcher (''directeur de recherche'') at [[National Institute for Research in Computer Science and Control|INRIA]]&lt;ref&gt;INRIA is the acronym for the [[National Institute for Research in Computer Science and Control]], in the original French, ''Institut national de recherche en informatique et en automatique'' (INRIA).&lt;/ref&gt; near [[Grenoble]], [[France]].

In [[mathematical optimization]], Claude Lemaréchal is known for his work in [[iterative method|numerical methods]] for  [[nonlinear optimization]], especially for problems with [[subdifferential|nondifferentiable kinks]]. Lemaréchal and Phil. Wolfe pioneered [[subgradient method &lt;!-- mentions bundle --&gt;|bundle methods of descent]] for [[convex optimization|convex minimization]].&lt;ref name="Citation of Claude Lemaréchal"&gt;[http://www.mathprog.org/Old-Optima-Issues/optima44.pdf Citation of Claude Lemaréchal] for the [[George Dantzig]] Prize in 1994 in ''Optima'', Issue 44 (1994) pages 4-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards ==

In 1994, Claude Lemaréchal and [[Roger J-B Wets]] were each awarded the [[George B. Dantzig]] Prize. Recognizing "original research that has had a major impact on the field of mathematical programming", the Dantzig Prize is awarded by the [[Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics]] (SIAM) and the Mathematical Programming Society (MPS).&lt;ref name="Citation of Claude Lemaréchal"/&gt;

==Lagrangian duality and nonconvex primal problems==
{{See also|Lagrangian multiplier|Convex analysis|Convex optimization}}
Soon after joining [[National Institute for Research in Computer Science and Control|INRIA]] (then named "[[National Institute for Research in Computer Science and Control|IRIA]]"), Lemaréchal had the assignment of helping a glass-manufacturer with a problem of [[scheduling (production processes)|scheduling its production]], a problem whose first formulation required [[optimization|minimizing]] a [[convex function|non-convex function]]. For this non-convex minimization problem, Lemaréchal applied the theory of [[Lagrangian multiplier|Lagrangian duality]] that was described in Lasdon's ''Optimization Theory for Large Systems''.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the primal problem was non-convex, there was no guarantee that a solution to the dual problem would provide useful information about the primal. Nonetheless, the dual problem did furnish useful information.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7795">A '''combinatorial map''' is a [[Combinatorics|combinatorial]] object modelling [[Topology|topological]] structures with subdivided objects. Historically, the concept was introduced informally by J. Edmonds for [[polyhedral surface]]s &lt;ref&gt;Edmonds J., A Combinatorial Representation for Polyhedral Surfaces, Notices Amer. Math. Soc., vol. 7, 1960&lt;/ref&gt; which are [[planar graph]]s. It was given its first definite formal expression under the name "Constellations" by A. Jacques &lt;ref&gt;Jacques A., Constellations et Graphes Topologiques, Colloque Math. Soc. János Bolyai, p. 657-672, 1970&lt;/ref&gt; but the concept was already extensively used under the name "rotation" by [[Gerhard Ringel]]&lt;ref&gt;Ringel G., Map Color Theorem, Springer-Verlag, Berlin 1974&lt;/ref&gt; and J.W.T. Youngs in their famous solution of the Heawood map-coloring problem. The term "constellation" was not retained and instead "combinatorial map" was favored. The concept was later extended to represent higher-dimensional orientable subdivided objects. Combinatorial maps are used as efficient data structures in image representation and [[image processing|processing]], in geometrical modeling. This model is related to [[simplicial complex]]es and to [[combinatorial topology]]. Note that combinatorial maps were extended to [[generalized maps]] that allow also to represent non-orientable objects like the [[Möbius strip]] and the [[Klein bottle]].  A combinatorial map is a [[boundary representation]] model; it represents object by its boundaries.

==Motivation==
Several applications require a data structure to represent the subdivision of an object. For example, a 2D object can be decomposed into vertices (0-cells), edges (1-cells), and faces (2-cells).  More generally, an n-dimensional object is composed with cells of dimension 0 to n. Moreover, it is also often necessary to represent neighboring relations between these cells.

Thus, we want to describe all the cells of the subdivision, plus all the incidence and adjacency relations between these cells.  When all the represented cells are simplexes, a [[simplicial complex]] may&lt;!-- In some cases, one cannot use simplicial complex even for simplicial cells. The problem is that a simplicial complex requires that no two simplexes share the same boundary. This can be violated for a general manifold. For example, triangulating a 2D torus can generate such a triangle pair even though all the cells are in fact simplexes. --&gt; be used, but when we want to represent any type of cells, we need to use cellular topological models like combinatorial maps or generalized maps.

==Planar graph representation==
The first works about combinatorial maps&lt;ref&gt;Jacques, A. Constellations et propriétés algébriques des graphes topologiques, Ph.D. thesis, Paris 1969&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cori R., Un code pour les graphes planaires et ses applications, Astérisque, vol. 27, 1975&lt;/ref&gt; develop combinatorial representations of graphs on surfaces which includes [[planar graph]]s: 
A 2-dimensional combinatorial map (or 2-map) is a triplet ''M''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''D'',&amp;nbsp;''σ'',&amp;nbsp;''α'') such that:
* ''D'' is a finite set of darts;
* ''σ'' is a [[Permutation#Permutations in group theory|permutation]] on ''D'';
* ''α'' is an [[Involution (mathematics)|involution]] on ''D'' with no fixed point.

Intuitively, a 2-map corresponds to a planar graph where each edge is subdivided into two darts (sometimes also called half-edges).  The permutation ''σ'' gives, for each dart, the next dart by turning around the vertex in the positive orientation; the other permutation ''α'' gives, for each dart, the other dart of the same edge.

''α'' allows one to retrieve edges ('''a'''lpha for '''a'''rête in French), and ''σ'' allows one to retrieve vertices ('''s'''igma for '''s'''ommet in French).  We define ''φ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''σ'' o ''α'' which gives, for each dart, the next dart of the same face ('''p'''hi for '''f'''ace also in French).

So, there are two ways to represent a combinatorial map depending if the permutation is ''σ'' or ''φ'' (see example below). These two representations are dual to each other: vertices and faces are exchanged.

&lt;/center&gt;

==General definition==
The definition of combinatorial map in any dimension is as follows.&lt;ref&gt;Lienhardt P., Topological models for Boundary Representation : a comparison with ''n''-dimensional generalized maps, ''Computer-Aided Design'', Vol. 23, no.1, pp. 59-82, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lienhardt P., N-dimensional generalized combinatorial maps and cellular quasi-manifolds, International Journal on Computational Geometry and Applications, Vol. 4, no. 3, pp. 275-324, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

An ''n''-dimensional combinatorial map (or ''n''-map) is a (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-tuple ''M''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''D'',&amp;nbsp;''β''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''β''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) such that:
* ''D'' is a finite set of darts;
* ''β''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[Permutation#Permutations in group theory|permutation]] on ''D'';
* ''β''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''β''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are [[Involution (mathematics)|involutions]] on ''D'';
* ''β''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;o&amp;nbsp;''β''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; is an involution if ''i''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''j'' (''i'',&amp;nbsp;''j'' ∈ {&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;,...,&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;}).

An ''n''-dimensional combinatorial map represents the subdivision of a closed orientable ''n''-dimensional space.  A dart is an abstract element which is only required to define one-to-one mappings.  The last line of this definition fixes constraints which guarantee the topological validity of the represented object: a combinatorial map represents a quasi-manifold subdivision. The initial definition of 2-dimensional combinatorial maps can be retrieved by fixing ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 and renaming ''σ'' by ''β''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''α'' by ''β''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

So, for example, &lt;math&gt;M_{0}^{2}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Euclidean plane]], &lt;math&gt;M_{1}^{2}&lt;/math&gt; is the surface of the [[unit sphere]], and &lt;math&gt;M_{-1}^{2}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic plane]].

Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a [[metric space]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7981">[[File:Congruum.svg|thumb|360px|The two [[right triangle]]s with leg and hypotenuse (7,13) and (13,17) have equal third sides of length {{radic|120}}. The square of this side, 120, is a congruum: it is the difference between consecutive values in the [[arithmetic progression]] of squares 7&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, 13&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, 17&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Equivalently, the two [[Annulus (mathematics)|annuli]] between the three yellow circles have equal areas, {{pi}} times the congruum.]]
In [[number theory]], a '''congruum''' (plural ''congrua'') is the [[Difference of two squares|difference]] between successive [[square number]]s in an [[arithmetic progression]] of three squares.
That is, if ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and ''z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (for integers ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'') are three square numbers that are equally spaced apart from each other, then the spacing between them, {{nowrap|1=''z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, is called a congruum.

The '''congruum problem''' is the problem of finding squares in arithmetic progression and their associated congrua.&lt;ref name="ubm" /&gt; It can be formalized as a [[Diophantine equation]]: find integers ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' such that
:&lt;math&gt;y^2 - x^2 = z^2 - y^2.&lt;/math&gt;
When this equation is satisfied, both sides of the equation equal the congruum.

[[Fibonacci]] solved the congruum problem by finding a parameterized formula for generating all congrua, together with their associated arithmetic progressions. According to this formula, each congruum is four times the area of a [[Pythagorean triangle]]. Congrua are also closely connected with [[congruent number]]s: every congruum is a congruent number, and every congruent number is a congruum multiplied by the square of a rational number.

== Examples ==
For instance,
the number 96 is a congruum, since it is the difference between adjacent squares in the sequence 4, 100, and 196 (the squares of 2, 10, and 14 respectively).

The first few congrua are:
:24, 96, 120, 216, 240, 336, 384, 480, 600, 720 … {{OEIS|id=A256418}}.

== History ==
The congruum problem was originally posed in 1225, as part of a mathematical tournament held by [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]], and answered correctly at that time by [[Fibonacci]], who recorded his work on this problem in his ''[[The Book of Squares|Book of Squares]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Birth of Mathematics: Ancient Times to 1300|first=Michael John|last=Bradley|publisher=Infobase Publishing|year=2006|isbn=978-0-8160-5423-7|page=124|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EIdtVPeD7GcC&amp;pg=PA124}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fibonacci was already aware that it is impossible for a congruum to itself be a square, but did not give a satisfactory proof of this fact.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Number Theory and Its History|first=Øystein|last=Ore|authorlink=Øystein Ore|publisher=Courier Dover Corporation|year=2012|isbn=978-0-486-13643-1|pages=202–203|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=beC7AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA202}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Geometrically, this means that it is not possible for the pair of legs of a Pythagorean triangle to be the leg and hypotenuse of another Pythagorean triangle. A proof was eventually given by [[Pierre de Fermat]], and the result is now known as [[Fermat's right triangle theorem]]. Fermat also conjectured, and [[Leonhard Euler]] proved, that there is no sequence of four squares in arithmetic progression.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Beautiful Mathematics|series=MAA Spectrum|publisher=Mathematical Association of America|first=Martin J.|last=Erickson|year=2011|isbn=978-0-88385-576-8|pages=94–95|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LgeP62-ZxikC&amp;pg=PA94}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Euler's proof is not clearly written. An elementary proof is given in {{citation|first=Kevin|last=Brown|website=MathPages|url=http://www.mathpages.com/home/kmath044/kmath044.htm|title=No Four Squares In Arithmetic Progression|accessdate=2014-12-06}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Parameterized solution ==
The congruum problem may be solved by choosing two distinct positive integers ''m'' and ''n'' (with ''m''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''n''); then the number 4''mn''(''m''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) is a congruum. The middle square of the associated arithmetic progression of squares is (''m''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and the other two squares may be found by adding or subtracting the congruum. Additionally, multiplying a congruum by a square number produces another congruum, whose progression of squares is multiplied by the same factor. All solutions arise in one of these two ways.&lt;ref name="ubm"&gt;{{citation|title=The Universal Book of Mathematics: From Abracadabra to Zeno's Paradoxes|first=David|last=Darling|authorlink=David J. Darling|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2004|isbn=978-0-471-66700-1|page=77|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HrOxRdtYYaMC&amp;pg=PA77}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the congruum 96 can be constructed by these formulas with ''m''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3 and ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, while the congruum 216 is obtained by multiplying the smaller congruum 24 by the square number 9.

An equivalent formulation of this solution, given by [[Bernard Frénicle de Bessy]], is that for the three squares in arithmetic progression ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and ''z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the middle number ''y'' is the [[hypotenuse]] of a [[Pythagorean triangle]] and the other two numbers ''x'' and ''z'' are the difference and sum respectively of the triangle's two legs.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Recreations in the Theory of Numbers: The Queen of Mathematics Entertains|first=Albert H.|last=Beiler|publisher=Courier Corporation|year=1964|isbn=978-0-486-21096-4|page=153|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fJTifbYNOzUC&amp;pg=PA153}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The congruum itself is four times the area of the same Pythagorean triangle. The example of an arithmetic progression with the congruum 96 can be obtained in this way from a right triangle with side and hypotenuse lengths 6, 8, and&amp;nbsp;10.

== Relation to congruent numbers ==
A [[congruent number]] is defined as the area of a right triangle with rational sides.
Because every congruum can be obtained (using the parameterized solution) as the area of a Pythagorean triangle, it follows that every congruum is congruent. Conversely, every congruent number is a congruum multiplied by the square of a rational number.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Keith|last=Conrad|authorlink=Keith Conrad|title=The congruent number problem|journal=Harvard College Mathematical Review|url=http://www.thehcmr.org/issue2_2/congruent_number.pdf|volume=2|issue=2|date=Fall 2008|pages=58–73|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120090003/http://www.thehcmr.org/issue2_2/congruent_number.pdf|archivedate=2013-01-20|df=}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, testing whether a number is a congruum is much easier than testing whether a number is congruent. For the congruum problem, the parameterized solution reduces this testing problem to checking a finite set of parameter values. In contrast, for the congruent number problem, a finite testing procedure is known only conjecturally, via [[Tunnell's theorem]], under the assumption that the [[Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture]] is true.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5120">In [[mathematics]], the '''curvature of a measure''' defined on the [[Euclidean plane]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is a quantification of how much the measure's "distribution of mass" is "curved". It is related to notions of [[curvature]] in [[geometry]]. In the form presented below, the concept was introduced in 1995 by the [[mathematician]] [[Mark S. Melnikov]]; accordingly, it may be referred to as the '''Melnikov curvature''' or '''Menger-Melnikov curvature'''. Melnikov and Verdera (1995) established a powerful connection between the curvature of measures and the [[Cauchy integral formula|Cauchy kernel]].

==Definition==

Let ''μ'' be a [[Borel measure]] on the Euclidean plane '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Given three (distinct) points ''x'', ''y'' and ''z'' in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, let ''R''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'',&amp;nbsp;''z'') be the [[radius]] of the Euclidean [[circle]] that joins all three of them, or +∞ if they are [[Line (geometry)|collinear]]. The [[Menger curvature]] ''c''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'',&amp;nbsp;''z'') is defined to be

:&lt;math&gt;c(x, y, z) = \frac{1}{R(x, y, z)},&lt;/math&gt;

with the natural convention that ''c''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'',&amp;nbsp;''z'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 if ''x'', ''y'' and ''z'' are collinear. It is also conventional to extend this definition by setting ''c''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'',&amp;nbsp;''z'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 if any of the points ''x'', ''y'' and ''z'' coincide. The '''Menger-Melnikov curvature''' ''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''μ'') of ''μ'' is defined to be

:&lt;math&gt;c^{2} (\mu) = \iiint_{\mathbb{R}^{2}} c(x, y, z)^{2} \, \mathrm{d} \mu (x) \mathrm{d} \mu (y) \mathrm{d} \mu (z).&lt;/math&gt;

More generally, for ''α''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0, define ''c''&lt;sup&gt;2''α''&lt;/sup&gt;(''μ'') by

:&lt;math&gt;c^{2 \alpha} (\mu) = \iiint_{\mathbb{R}^{2}} c(x, y, z)^{2 \alpha} \, \mathrm{d} \mu (x) \mathrm{d} \mu (y) \mathrm{d} \mu (z).&lt;/math&gt;

One may also refer to the curvature of ''μ'' at a given point ''x'':

:&lt;math&gt;c^{2} (\mu; x) = \iint_{\mathbb{R}^{2}} c(x, y, z)^{2} \, \mathrm{d} \mu (y) \mathrm{d} \mu (z),&lt;/math&gt;

in which case

:&lt;math&gt;c^{2} (\mu) = \int_{\mathbb{R}^{2}} c^{2} (\mu; x) \, \mathrm{d} \mu (x).&lt;/math&gt;

==Examples==

* The [[trivial measure]] has zero curvature.
* A [[Dirac measure]] ''δ''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; supported at any point ''a'' has zero curvature.
* If ''μ'' is any measure whose [[support (measure theory)|support]] is contained within a Euclidean line ''L'', then ''μ'' has zero curvature. For example, one-dimensional [[Lebesgue measure]] on any line (or line segment) has zero curvature.
* The Lebesgue measure defined on all of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; has infinite curvature.
* If ''μ'' is the uniform one-dimensional [[Hausdorff measure]] on a circle ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; or radius ''r'', then ''μ'' has curvature 1/''r''.

==Relationship to the Cauchy kernel==

In this section, '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is thought of as the [[complex plane]] '''C'''. Melnikov and Verdera (1995) showed the precise relation of the [[bounded operator|boundedness]] of the Cauchy kernel to the curvature of measures. They proved that if there is some constant ''C''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; such that

:&lt;math&gt;\mu(B_{r} (x)) \leq C_{0} r&lt;/math&gt;

for all ''x'' in '''C''' and all ''r''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;0, then there is another constant ''C'', depending only on ''C''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, such that

:&lt;math&gt;\left| 6 \int_{\mathbb{C}} | \mathcal{C}_{\varepsilon} (\mu) (z) |^{2} \, \mathrm{d} \mu (z) - c_{\varepsilon}^{2} (\mu) \right| \leq C \| \mu \|&lt;/math&gt;

for all ''ε''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;0. Here ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''ε''&lt;/sub&gt; denotes a truncated version of the Menger-Melnikov curvature in which the integral is taken only over those points ''x'', ''y'' and ''z'' such that

:&lt;math&gt;| x - y | &gt; \varepsilon;&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;| y - z | &gt; \varepsilon;&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;| z - x | &gt; \varepsilon.&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}_{\varepsilon}&lt;/math&gt; denotes a truncated Cauchy integral operator: for a measure ''μ'' on '''C''' and a point ''z'' in '''C''', define

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}_{\varepsilon} (\mu) (z) = \int \frac{1}{\xi - z} \, \mathrm{d} \mu (\xi),&lt;/math&gt;

where the integral is taken over those points ''ξ'' in '''C''' with

:&lt;math&gt;| \xi - z | &gt; \varepsilon.&lt;/math&gt;

'''David Peter Robbins''' (12 August 1942 in [[Brooklyn]] – 4 September 2003 in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]]) was an [[United States|American]] [[mathematician]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|author=O'Connor, Anahad|authorlink=Anahad O'Connor|date=18 September 2003|title=David Robbins, 61, Unraveler Of Complex Math Equations|newspaper=NY Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/18/nyregion/david-robbins-61-unraveler-of-complex-math-equations.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He is most famous for introducing [[Alternating sign matrix|alternating sign matrices]].&lt;ref name="cnrrl"&gt;{{citation

Robbins grew up in [[Manhattan]], where he attended the [[Ethical Culture Fieldston School|Fieldston School]].&lt;ref name="cnrrl"/&gt;  He studied at [[Harvard]], where his undergraduate advisor was [[Andrew Gleason]].&lt;ref name="cnrrl"/&gt;  He went to [[MIT]] to do his graduate work and, after a hiatus during which he taught at Fieldston, finished his [[Ph.D.]] in 1970.&lt;ref name="cnrrl"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{mathgenealogy|name=David Peter Robbins|id=64867}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  He then taught at MIT, [[Phillips Exeter Academy]], [[Hamilton College (New York)|Hamilton College]] and [[Washington and Lee University]].&lt;ref name="cnrrl"/&gt;  In 1980 he moved to [[Princeton, New Jersey]] and worked at the [[Institute for Defense Analyses|Institute for Defense Analyses Center for Communications Research]] there until his death from [[pancreatic cancer]].&lt;ref name="cnrrl"/&gt;

A symposium was held in Robbins' honor in June 2003, the papers from which were published as a special issue of the journal ''[[Advances in Applied Mathematics]]''.&lt;ref name="cnrrl"/&gt; The [[Mathematical Association of America]] established a prize named in his honor in 2005, given every three years to one or more researchers in algebra, combinatorics, or discrete mathematics.

'''Digital credentials''' are the digital equivalent of paper-based [[credentials]]. Just as a paper-based credential could be a [[passport]], a [[driver's license]], a membership certificate or some kind of ticket to obtain some service, such as a cinema ticket or a public transport ticket, a digital credential is a proof of qualification, competence, or clearance that is attached to a person. Also, digital credentials prove something about their owner. Both types of credentials may contain personal information such as the person's name, birthplace, birthdate, and/or biometric information such as a picture or a finger print.

Because of the still evolving, and sometimes conflicting, terminologies used in the fields of computer science, computer security, and cryptography, the term "digital credential" is used quite confusingly in these fields. Sometimes passwords or other means of authentication are referred to as credentials. In [[operating system]] design, credentials are the properties of a [[Process (computing)|process]] (such as its effective [[User identifier (Unix)|UID]]) that is used for determining its access rights. On other occasions, [[Public key certificate|certificates]] and associated key material such as those stored in [[PKCS]]#12 and [[PKCS]]#15 are referred to as credentials.

[[Digital badge]]s are a form of digital credential that indicate an accomplishment, skill, quality or interest. Digital badges can be earned in a variety of learning environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = A Future Full of Badges | url = http://chronicle.com/article/A-Future-Full-of-Badges/131455/ |date=8 April 2012| publisher = The Chronicle of Higher Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Real / digital world analogy==
Real world credentials are a diverse social phenomenon, and as such are difficult to define. As with [[digital signature]]s it is misleading to assume a direct correspondence between the real-world and the digital concept. This holds even if defining criteria for credentials in the digital world could be agreed on.

The success of digital signatures as a replacement for paper based signatures has lagged behind expectations. On the other hand, many unexpected uses of digital signatures were discovered by recent cryptographic research. A related insight that can be learned from digital signatures is that the cryptographic mechanism need not be confused with overall process that turns a digital signature into something that has more or less the same properties as a paper based signature. Electronic signatures such as paper signatures sent by fax may have legal meaning, while secure cryptographic signatures may serve completely different purposes. We need to distinguish the [[algorithm]] from the [[Process (computing)|process]].

==Digital cash==
[[Money]] is usually not seen as a qualification that is attached to a specific person as [[token money]] is taken to have a value on its own. Digital assets like [[digital cash]] are easily copied. Consequently, digital cash protocols have to make an extra effort to avoid the [[double spending]] of coins. Credentials are a proof of qualification that is attached to a person. E-Coins are given to individuals, who cannot pass them on to others, but can only spend them with merchants. As long as they spend a coin only once, they are anonymous, but should they spend a coin twice, they become identifiable and appropriate actions can be taken by the bank. This commonality, the binding to an individual, is why digital cash and digital credentials share many commonalities. In fact most implementations of anonymous digital credential also realize digital cash.

==Anonymous==
The main idea behind anonymous digital credentials is that users are given cryptographic tokens which allow them to prove statements about themselves and their relationships with public and private organizations anonymously. This is seen as a more privacy-friendly alternative to keeping and using large centralized and linkable user records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = PRIME Whitepaper: privacy enhanced identity management | url = https://www.prime-project.eu/prime_products/whitepaper/PRIME-Whitepaper-V2.pdf | format = [[PDF]] | date = 27 June 2007 | publisher = PRIME}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anonymous digital credentials are thus related to [[privacy]] and [[anonymity]].

Paper world analogues of personalized, or non-anonymous [[credential]]s are: passports, driving licenses, credit cards, health insurance cards, club membership cards etc. These contain the name of the owner and have some authenticating information such as a signature, PIN or photograph, to stop them being used by anyone other than the rightful owner. Paper world analogues of anonymous credentials are: money, bus and train tickets, and game-arcade tokens. These don't have any personally identifying information and consequently can be transferred between users without the issuers or relying parties being aware of this. Credentials are issued by organizations that ascertain the authenticity of the information which can be provided to verifying entities on demand.

In order to investigate certain privacy specific properties of credentials, we take a more detailed look at two kind of 'credentials', physical money and credit cards. Without doubt both of them provide adequate information for doing payment transactions. However the amount and quality of the information disclosed varies. Money is protected from forgery by its physical properties. Beyond that, only very little information is revealed:
Coins feature an ingrained value and the year of coining; in addition bank notes contain a unique serial number in order to provide the traceability required by law enforcement.

On the other hand, the use of a credit card, whose main purpose is similar to money, allows for the creation of highly detailed records about the card owner. Credit cards are therefore not privacy protecting. The main privacy advantage of money is that its users can remain anonymous. There are however other security and usability properties that make real world cash popular.

Credentials used in a national identification system are also especially privacy relevant. Such an ID, be it a passport, a driver's license, or some other type of card usually contains essential personal information. In certain situations it may be advantageous to reveal only parts of the information contained on the ID, e.g., some lower limit for the person's age or the fact that the person is capable of driving a car.

===Pseudonyms===
The original anonymous credential system proposed by [[David Chaum]]&lt;ref name="chaum_bigbrother"&gt;{{cite journal | first = David | last = Chaum | authorlink = David Chaum | title = Security without identification: transaction systems to make big brother obsolete | journal = Communications of the ACM | volume = 28 |date=October 1985 | issue = 10 | doi = 10.1145/4372.4373 | pages = 1030–1044}}&lt;/ref&gt; is sometimes also referred to as a pseudonym system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Anna | last1 = Lysyanskaya | author1-link=Anna Lysyanskaya | authorlink2 = Ron Rivest | first2 = Ronald L. | last2 = Rivest | first3 = Amit | last3 = Sahai | first4 = Stefan | last4 = Wolf | chapter = Pseudonym systems | title = [[Selected Areas in Cryptography]] | editor1-link = Howard Heys | editor1-first = Howard M. | editor1-last = Heys | editor2-link = Carlisle Adams | editor2-first = Carlisle M | editor2-last = Adams | series = [[Lecture Notes in Computer Science]] | volume = 1758 | publisher = Springer | year = 2000 | isbn = 978-3-540-67185-5 | doi = 10.1007/3-540-46513-8_14 | pages = 184–199}}&lt;/ref&gt; This stems from the fact that the credentials of such a system are obtained from and shown to organizations using different pseudonyms which cannot be linked.

The introduction of pseudonyms&lt;ref name="chaum_bigbrother"/&gt; is a useful extension to anonymity.
''Pseudonyms'' allow users to choose a different name with each organization. While pseudonyms allow organizations to associate users with accounts, organizations cannot determine the real identities of their customers.  Nevertheless, by using an anonymous credential, certain statements about the relationship of a user with one organization, under a pseudonym, can be proven to another organization that knows the user only under a different pseudonym.

===History===
Anonymous credential systems are related to the concept of untraceable or anonymous payments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | authorlink = David Chaum | first = David | last = Chaum | title = Blind signatures for untraceable payments | booktitle = Advances in Cryptology | conference = [[CRYPTO]] '82 | editor1-first = David | editor1-last = Chaum | editor2-first = Ronald L. | editor2-last = Rivest | editor3-first = Alan T | editor3-last = Sherman | publisher = Plenum Press | year = 1983 | volume = 0 | pages = 199–203}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this important work, Chaum presents a new cryptographic primitive, [[blind signature]] protocols. In such a scheme the signer neither learns the message he signs, nor the signature the recipient obtains for his message. Blind signatures are an important building block of many privacy-sensitive applications, such as anonymous payments, voting, and credentials. The original idea for an anonymous credential system&lt;ref name="chaum_bigbrother"/&gt; was derived from blind signatures, but relied on a [[Trusted third party|trusted party]] for credential transfer—the translation from one pseudonym to another. The blind signature scheme introduced by Chaum was based on [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]] signatures and based on the [[discrete logarithm]] problem can be used for constructing anonymous credential systems.

[[Stefan Brands]] generalized digital credentials with secret-key certificate based credentials, improving on Chaum's basic blind-signature based system in both the discrete logarithm and strong RSA assumption settings. Brands credentials provide efficient algorithms and privacy in an unconditional commercial security setting,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.credentica.com | title = Credentica}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with several other features such as a proof of non-membership blacklist.&lt;ref name="brands_cred"&gt;{{cite book | first = Stefan A. | last = Brands | title = Rethinking public key infrastructures and digital certificates | publisher = MIT Press | year = 2000 | isbn = 978-0-262-02491-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another credential form that adds a new feature to anonymous credentials: multi-show unlinkability.  These are the [[group signature]] related credentials of Camenisch et al. The introduction of [[Group signature]]s opened up the possibility of multi-show unlinkable showing protocols. While blind signatures are highly relevant for electronic cash and one-show credentials, a new cryptographic primitive, called [[group signature]], opened new possibilities for the construction of privacy enhancing protocols.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1 = David | last1 = Chaum | first2 = Eugene | last2 = van Heyst | chapter = Group signatures | title = Advances in Cryptology – [[EUROCRYPT]] '91 | editor-link = Donald Davies | editor-first = Donald W | editor-last = Davies | series = [[Lecture Notes in Computer Science]] | volume = 547 | publisher = Springer | year = 1991 | isbn = 978-3-540-54620-7 | doi = 10.1007/3-540-46416-6_22 | pages = 257–265}}&lt;/ref&gt; As is observed in their article, group signatures bear a resemblance to Chaum's concept of credential systems.&lt;ref name="chaum_bigbrother"/&gt;

Using a group signature scheme, the members of a group can sign a message with their respective secret keys. The resulting signature can be verified by everyone who knows the common public key, but the signature does not reveal any information about the signer except that she is a member of the group.  Usually there exists another entity called the group manager, who can reveal the exact identity of the signer, and handles the adding of users to and the removal of users from the group—usually by issuing or revoking group membership certificates. The anonymity, unlinkability, and anonymity revocation provided by group signatures lends itself for a variety of privacy sensitive applications like voting, bidding, anonymous payment, and anonymous credentials

An efficient constructions for group signatures was given by Ateniese, Camenisch, [[Marc Joye|Joye]], and Tsudik.&lt;ref name="ateniese_group"&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Giuseppe | last1 = Ateniese | first2 = Jan | last2 = Camenisch | first3 = Marc | last3 = Joye | first4 = Gene | last4 = Tsudik | chapter = A practical and provably secure coalition-resistant group signature scheme | editor-first = Mihir | editor-last = Bellare | title = Advances in Cryptology — [[CRYPTO]] 2000 | series = [[Lecture Notes in Computer Science]] | volume = 1880 | publisher = Springer | year = 2000 | isbn = 978-3-540-67907-3 | doi = 10.1007/3-540-44598-6_16 | pages = 255–270}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The most efficient multi-show unlinkable anonymous credential systems&lt;ref name="camenisch_cred"&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Jan | last1 = Camenisch | first2 = Anna | last2 = Lysyanskaya |author2-link=Anna Lysyanskaya| chapter = An efficient system for non-transferable anonymous credentials with optional anonymity revocation | title = Advances in Cryptology — [[EUROCRYPT]] 2001  | editor-first = Birgit | editor-last = Pfitzmann | series = [[Lecture Notes in Computer Science]] | volume = 2045 | publisher = Springer | year = 2001 | isbn = 978-3-540-42070-5 | doi = 10.1007/3-540-44987-6_7 | pages = 93–118}}&lt;/ref&gt;—the latter is essentially a low profile version of idemix&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.zurich.ibm.com/security/idemix/ | title = idemix- pseudonymity for e-transactions | publisher = [[IBM]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;—are based on similar ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Jan | last1 = Camenisch | first2 = Anna | last2 = Lysyanskaya|author2-link=Anna Lysyanskaya | chapter = A Signature Scheme with Efficient Protocols  | title = Security in Communication Networks | editor1-first = Stelvio | editor1-last = Cimato | editor2-first = Clemente | editor2-last = Galdi | editor3-first = Giuseppe | editor3-last = Persiano | series = [[Lecture Notes in Computer Science]] | volume = 2576 | publisher = Springer | year = 2003 | isbn = 978-3-540-00420-2 | doi = 10.1007/3-540-36413-7_20 | pages = 268–289}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is particularly true for credential systems that provide efficient means for implementing anonymous multi-show credentials with credential revocation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Jan | last1 = Camenisch | first2 = Anna | last2 = Lysyanskaya|author2-link=Anna Lysyanskaya | chapter = Dynamic Accumulators and Application to Efficient Revocation of Anonymous Credentials | title = Advances in Cryptology — [[CRYPTO]] 2002 | editor-first = Moti | editor-last = Yung | series = [[Lecture Notes in Computer Science]] | volume = 2442 | publisher = Springer | year = 2002 | isbn = 978-3-540-44050-5 | doi = 10.1007/3-540-45708-9_5 | pages = 101–120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both schemes are based on techniques for doing [[proof of knowledge|proofs of knowledge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author1-link = Mihir Bellare | first1 = Mihir | last1 = Bellare | first2 = Oded | last2 = Goldreich | chapter = On Defining Proofs of Knowledge | title = Advances in Cryptology — [[CRYPTO]] ’92 | editor-first = Ernest F | editor-last = Brickell | series = [[Lecture Notes in Computer Science]] | volume = 740 | publisher = Springer | year = 1993 | isbn = 978-3-540-57340-1 | doi = 10.1007/3-540-48071-4_28 | pages = 390–420}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | authorlink = Claus P. Schnorr | first = Claus-Peter | last = Schnorr | title = Efficient signature generation by smart cards | journal = [[Journal of Cryptology]] | volume = 4 |date=January 1991 | issue = 3 | doi = 10.1007/BF00196725 | pages = 161–174}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Proofs of knowledge relying on the discrete logarithm problem for groups of known order and on the special RSA problem for groups of hidden order form the basis for most of today's group signature and anonymous credential systems.&lt;ref name="brands_cred"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ateniese_group"/&gt;&lt;ref name="camenisch_cred"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Jan | last1 = Camenisch | first2 = Markus | last2 = Michels | chapter = A Group Signature Scheme with Improved Efficiency | title = Advances in Cryptology — [[ASIACRYPT]] ’98 | editor1 = Kazuo Ohta |editor2=Dingyi Pei | series = [[Lecture Notes in Computer Science]] | volume = 1514 | publisher = Springer | year = 1998 | isbn = 978-3-540-65109-3 | doi = 10.1007/3-540-49649-1_14 | pages = 160–174}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, [[direct anonymous attestation]] a protocol for authenticating [[trusted platform module]]s is based on the same techniques.

[[Direct anonymous attestation]] can be seen as the first commercial application of multi show anonymous digital credentials, even though in this case credentials are not attached to persons, but to chips and consequently computer platforms.

From an applications' point of view, the main advantage of Camenisch et al.'s multi-show unlinkable credentials over the more efficient Brands credentials is the multi-show unlinkable property. However, this property is mainly of practical interest in an off-line setting. Brands credentials provide a mechanism that gives analogous functionality without sacrificing performance: an efficient batch issuing protocol which can simultaneously issue many unlinkable credentials. This mechanism can be combined with a privacy preserving certificate refresh process (which gives a fresh unlinkable credential with the same attributes as a previous spent credential).

== Online credentials for learning ==
{{Main|Online credentials for learning}}

Online credentials for learning are digital credentials that are offered in place of traditional paper credentials for a skill or educational achievement. Directly linked to the accelerated development of internet communication technologies, the development of [[digital badge]]s, [[electronic passport]]s and [[massive open online course]]s (MOOCs) have a very direct bearing on our understanding of learning, recognition and levels as they pose a direct challenge to the status quo. It is useful to distinguish between three forms of online credentials: Test-based credentials, online badges, and online certificates.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002428/242887e.pdf|title=Level-setting and recognition of learning outcomes: The use of level descriptors in the twenty-first century|last=Keevy|first=James|last2=Chakroun|first2=Borhene|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100138-3|location=|pages=129–131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1175">'''Dynamic timing verification''' refers to verifying that an [[Application-specific integrated circuit|ASIC]] design is fast enough to run without errors at the targeted clock rate.  This is accomplished by simulating the design files used to synthesize the [[integrated circuit]] (IC) design.  This is in contrast to [[static timing analysis]], which has a similar goal as dynamic timing verification except it does not require simulating the real functionality of the IC.&lt;ref name="ASIC world"&gt;"ASIC world: vol 10", page 13, October 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Hobbyists often perform a type of dynamic timing verification when they over-clock the CPUs in their computers in order to find the fastest clock rate at which they can run the CPU without errors.  This is a type of dynamic timing verification that is performed after the silicon is manufactured.  In the field of ASIC design, this timing verification is preferably performed before manufacturing the IC in order to make sure that IC works under the required conditions before mass production of the IC.&lt;ref name="ASIC world"/&gt;

The '''Ehrenfest theorem''', named after [[Paul Ehrenfest]], an Austrian theoretical physicist at [[Leiden University]], relates the time [[derivative]] of the [[Expectation value (quantum mechanics)|expectation values]] of the position and momentum [[operator (physics)|operators]] ''x'' and ''p'' to the expectation value of the force &lt;math&gt;F=-V'(x)&lt;/math&gt; on a massive particle moving in a scalar potential &lt;math&gt;V(x)&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2013}} Section 3.7.5&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Equation box 1

Although, at first glance, it might appear that the Ehrenfest theorem is saying that the quantum mechanical expectation values obey Newton’s classical equations of motion, this is not actually the case.&lt;ref name="Wheeler"&gt;{{cite web| last=Wheeler | first=Nicholas | title=Remarks concerning the status &amp; some ramifications of Ehrenfest's theorem | url=http://academic.reed.edu/physics/faculty/wheeler/documents/Quantum%20Mechanics/Miscellaneous%20Essays/Ehrenfest's%20Theorem.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the pair &lt;math&gt;(\langle x\rangle,\langle p\rangle)&lt;/math&gt; were to satisfy Newton's second law, the right-hand side of the second equation would have to be
:&lt;math&gt;-V'\left(\left\langle x\right\rangle\right)&lt;/math&gt;,
which is typically not the same as
:&lt;math&gt;-\left\langle V'(x)\right\rangle&lt;/math&gt;.
If for example, the potential &lt;math&gt;V(x)&lt;/math&gt; is cubic, (i.e. proportional to &lt;math&gt;x^3&lt;/math&gt;), then &lt;math&gt;V'&lt;/math&gt; is quadratic (proportional to &lt;math&gt;x^2&lt;/math&gt;). This means, in the case of Newton's second law, the right side would be in the form of &lt;math&gt;\langle x\rangle^2&lt;/math&gt;, while in the Ehrenfest theorem it is in the form of &lt;math&gt;\langle x^2\rangle&lt;/math&gt;. The difference between these two quantities is the square of the uncertainty in &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and is therefore nonzero.

An exception occurs in case when the classical equations of motion are linear, that is, when &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is quadratic and &lt;math&gt;V'&lt;/math&gt; is linear. In that special case, &lt;math&gt;V'\left(\left\langle x\right\rangle\right)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\left\langle V'(x)\right\rangle&lt;/math&gt; do agree. Thus, for the case of a quantum harmonic oscillator, the expected position and expected momentum do exactly follow the classical trajectories.

For general systems, if the wave function is highly concentrated around a point &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;V'\left(\left\langle x\right\rangle\right)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\left\langle V'(x)\right\rangle&lt;/math&gt; will be ''almost'' the same, since both will be approximately equal to &lt;math&gt;V'(x_0)&lt;/math&gt;. In that case, the expected position and expected momentum will ''approximately'' follow the classical trajectories, at least for as long as the wave function remains localized in position.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2013}} p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ehrenfest theorem is a special case of a more general relation between the expectation of any [[Quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] [[operator (physics)|operator]] and the expectation of the  [[commutator]] of that operator with the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] of the system &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ehrenfest | first1 = P. | title = Bemerkung über die angenäherte Gültigkeit der klassischen Mechanik innerhalb der Quantenmechanik | doi = 10.1007/BF01329203 | journal = Zeitschrift für Physik | volume = 45 | issue = 7–8 | pages = 455–457 | year = 1927 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 1927ZPhy...45..455E }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite book | last=Smith | first=Henrik | year=1991 | title=Introduction to Quantum Mechanics | publisher=World Scientific Pub Co Inc |isbn=978-9810204754| pages=108–109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

where {{mvar|A}} is some quantum mechanical operator and {{math|⟨''A''⟩}} is its [[expectation value]]. This more general theorem was not actually derived by Ehrenfest (it is due to [[Werner Heisenberg]]).

It is most apparent in the [[Heisenberg picture]] of quantum mechanics, where it is just the expectation value of the Heisenberg equation of motion.  It provides mathematical support to the [[correspondence principle]].

The reason is that Ehrenfest's theorem is closely related to [[Liouville's theorem (Hamiltonian)|Liouville's theorem]] of [[Hamiltonian mechanics]], which involves the [[Poisson bracket]] instead of a commutator.  Dirac's [[rule of thumb]] suggests that statements in quantum mechanics which contain a commutator correspond to statements in classical mechanics where  the commutator is supplanted by a Poisson bracket  multiplied by {{math|''iħ''}}. This makes the operator expectation values obey corresponding classical equations of motion, provided the Hamiltonian is at most quadratic in the coordinates and momenta. Otherwise, the evolution equations still may hold [[Moyal bracket|approximately]], provided fluctuations are small.

== Derivation in the Schrödinger picture ==
Suppose some system is presently in a [[quantum state]] {{math|Φ}}. If we want to know the instantaneous time derivative of the expectation value of {{mvar|A}}, that is, by definition

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\langle A\rangle &amp;= \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\int \Phi^* A \Phi\,\mathrm{d}x^3 \\
&amp;= \int \left( \frac{\partial \Phi^*}{\partial t} \right) A\Phi\,\mathrm{d}x^3 + \int \Phi^* \left( \frac{\partial A}{\partial t}\right) \Phi\,\mathrm{d}x^3 +\int \Phi^* A \left( \frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial t} \right)\,\mathrm{d}x^3 \\
&amp;= \int \left( \frac{\partial \Phi^*}{\partial t} \right) A\Phi\,\mathrm{d}x^3 + \left\langle \frac{\partial A}{\partial t}\right\rangle + \int \Phi^* A \left( \frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial t} \right)\,\mathrm{d}x^3
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where we are integrating over all space. If we apply the [[Schrödinger equation]], we find that

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial t} = \frac{1}{i\hbar}H\Phi&lt;/math&gt;

By taking the complex conjugate we find

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \Phi^*}{\partial t} = -\frac{1}{i\hbar}\Phi^*H^* = -\frac{1}{i\hbar}\Phi^*H.&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref&gt;In [[bra–ket notation]], &lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\langle \phi |x\rangle =\frac{-1}{i\hbar}\langle \phi |\hat{H}|x\rangle =\frac{-1}{i\hbar}\langle \phi |x \rangle H=\frac{-1}{i\hbar}\Phi^*H,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\hat{H}&lt;/math&gt; is the Hamiltonian operator, and {{mvar|H}} is the Hamiltonian represented in coordinate space (as is the case in the derivation above). In other words, we applied the adjoint operation to the entire Schrödinger equation, which flipped the order of operations for {{mvar|H}} and {{math|Φ}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Note {{math|''H'' {{=}} ''H''&amp;thinsp;&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;}}, because the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] is [[hermitian operator|Hermitian]].  Placing this into the above equation we have

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\langle A\rangle = \frac{1}{i\hbar}\int \Phi^* (AH-HA) \Phi~dx^3 + \left\langle \frac{\partial A}{\partial t}\right\rangle = \frac{1}{i\hbar}\langle [A,H]\rangle + \left\langle \frac{\partial A}{\partial t}\right\rangle.&lt;/math&gt;

Often (but not always) the operator {{mvar|A}} is time independent, so that its derivative is zero and we can ignore the last term.

== Derivation in the Heisenberg picture ==
In the [[Heisenberg picture]], the derivation is trivial. The Heisenberg picture moves the time dependence of the system to operators instead of state vector. Starting with the Heisenberg equation of motion

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}A(t) = \frac{\partial A(t)}{\partial t} + \frac{1}{i \hbar}[A(t),H],&lt;/math&gt;

we can derive Ehrenfest's theorem simply by projecting the Heisenberg equation onto &lt;math&gt; |\Psi\rangle &lt;/math&gt; from the right and &lt;math&gt; \langle\Psi| &lt;/math&gt; from the left, or taking the expectation value, so

:&lt;math&gt;\left\langle\Psi\left|\frac{d}{dt}A(t)\right|\Psi\right\rangle = \left\langle\Psi\left|\frac{\partial A(t)}{\partial t}\right|\Psi\right\rangle + \left\langle\Psi\left|\frac{1}{i \hbar}[A(t),H]\right|\Psi\right\rangle,&lt;/math&gt;

We can pull the {{math|{{sfrac|''d''|''dt''}}}} out of the first term since the state vectors are no longer time dependent in the Heisenberg Picture. Therefore,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\langle A(t)\rangle = \left\langle\frac{\partial A(t)}{\partial t}\right\rangle + \frac{1}{i \hbar}\left\langle[A(t),H]\right\rangle&lt;/math&gt;

== General example ==
The expectation values of the theorem, however, are the very same in the [[Schrödinger picture]] as well. For the very general example of a massive [[Elementary particle|particle]] moving in a [[potential]], the Hamiltonian is simply

:&lt;math&gt; H(x,p,t) = \frac{p^2}{2m} + V(x,t) &lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|x}} is the position of the particle.

Suppose we wanted to know the instantaneous change in momentum {{mvar|p}}. Using Ehrenfest's theorem, we have

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dt}\langle p\rangle = \frac{1}{i\hbar}\langle [p,H]\rangle + \left\langle \frac{\partial p}{\partial t}\right\rangle =
\frac{1}{i\hbar}\langle [p,V(x,t)]\rangle,&lt;/math&gt;

since the operator {{mvar|p}} commutes with itself and has no time dependence.&lt;ref&gt;Although the expectation value of the momentum {{math|⟨''p''⟩}}, which is a [[Real number|real-number]]-valued function of time, will have time dependence, the momentum operator itself, {{mvar|p}} does not, in this picture: Rather, the momentum operator is a constant [[linear operator]] on the [[Hilbert space]] of the system. The time dependence of the expectation value, in this picture, is due to the [[time evolution]] of the wavefunction for which the expectation value is calculated. An [[Ad hoc]] example of an operator which does have time dependence is {{math|⟨''xt''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;⟩}}, where {{mvar|x}} is the ordinary position operator and {{mvar|t}} is just the (non-operator) time, a parameter.&lt;/ref&gt; By expanding the right-hand-side, replacing {{mvar|p}} by  {{math| −''iħ''∇}}, we get

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\langle p\rangle = \int \Phi^* V(x,t)\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\Phi~dx - \int \Phi^* \frac{\partial}{\partial x} (V(x,t)\Phi)~dx ~.&lt;/math&gt;

After applying the [[product rule]] on the second term, we have

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
\frac{d}{dt}\langle p\rangle &amp;= \int \Phi^* V(x,t) \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\Phi~dx - \int \Phi^* \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x} V(x,t)\right)\Phi ~dx - \int \Phi^* V(x,t) \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\Phi~dx \\
&amp;= - \int \Phi^* \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x} V(x,t)\right)\Phi ~dx \\
&amp;= \left\langle - \frac{\partial}{\partial x} V(x,t)\right\rangle = \langle F \rangle,
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;.

As explained in the introduction, this result does ''not'' say that the pair &lt;math&gt;(\langle X\rangle,\langle P\rangle)&lt;/math&gt; satisfies [[Newton's second law]], because the right-hand side of the formula is &lt;math&gt;\langle F(x,t)\rangle,&lt;/math&gt; rather than &lt;math&gt;F(\langle X\rangle,t)&lt;/math&gt;. Nevertheless, as explained in the introduction, for states that are highly localized in space, the expected position and momentum will ''approximately'' follow classical trajectories, which may be understood as an instance of the [[correspondence principle]].

Similarly, we can obtain the instantaneous change in the position expectation value.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{d}{dt}\langle x\rangle &amp;= \frac{1}{i\hbar}\langle [x,H]\rangle + \left\langle \frac{\partial x}{\partial t}\right\rangle \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{i\hbar} \left \langle \left [x,\frac{p^2}{2m} + V(x,t) \right ] \right \rangle + 0 \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{i\hbar} \left \langle \left [x,\frac{p^2}{2m} \right] \right \rangle \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{i\hbar 2 m} \left \langle [x,p] \frac{d}{dp} p^2 \right\rangle \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{i\hbar 2 m}\langle i \hbar 2 p\rangle \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{m}\langle p\rangle
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

This result is actually in exact accord with the classical equation.

== Derivation of the Schrödinger equation from the Ehrenfest theorems ==
It was established above that the Ehrenfest theorems are consequences of the [[Schrödinger equation]]. However, the converse is also true: the Schrödinger equation can be inferred from the Ehrenfest theorems.&lt;ref name=Bondar2012&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bondar | first1 = D. | last2 = Cabrera | first2 = R. | last3 = Lompay | first3 = R. | last4 = Ivanov | first4 = M. | last5 = Rabitz | first5 = H. | title = Operational Dynamic Modeling Transcending Quantum and Classical Mechanics | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.109.190403 | journal = Physical Review Letters | volume = 109 | issue = 19 | pages = 190403 | year = 2012 | pmid =  23215365| pmc = |arxiv = 1105.4014 |bibcode = 2012PhRvL.109s0403B }}&lt;/ref&gt; We begin from

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
m\frac{d}{dt} \left \langle \Psi(t) \right | \hat{x} \left | \Psi(t) \right \rangle &amp;= \left \langle \Psi(t) \right | \hat{p} \left | \Psi(t) \right \rangle, \\
\frac{d}{dt} \left \langle \Psi(t) \right | \hat{p} \left | \Psi(t) \right \rangle &amp;= \left \langle \Psi(t) \right | -V'(\hat{x}) \left | \Psi(t) \right \rangle.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Applications of the [[product rule]] leads to

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\left \langle \frac{d\Psi}{dt} \Big | \hat{x} \Big | \Psi \right \rangle + \left \langle \Psi \Big | \hat{x} \Big | \frac{d\Psi}{dt} \right \rangle &amp;= \left \langle \Psi \Big | \frac{\hat{p}}{m} \Big | \Psi \right \rangle, \\
\left \langle \frac{d\Psi}{dt} \Big | \hat{p} \Big | \Psi \right \rangle + \left \langle \Psi \Big | \hat{p} \Big | \frac{d\Psi}{dt} \right \rangle &amp;= \langle \Psi | -V'(\hat{x}) | \Psi \rangle,
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;
Here, apply [[Stone's theorem on one-parameter unitary groups|Stone's theorem]], using {{mvar|Ĥ}} to denote the quantum generator of time translation.  The next step is to show that this is the same as the Hamiltonian operator used in quantum mechanics.  Stone's theorem implies

:&lt;math&gt;i\hbar \left | \frac{d\Psi}{dt} \right \rangle = \hat{H} | \Psi(t) \rangle ~,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|ħ}} was introduced as a normalization constant to the balance dimensionality. Since these identities must be valid for any initial state, the averaging can be dropped and the system of commutator equations for {{mvar|Ĥ}} are derived:
:&lt;math&gt;im [\hat{H}, \hat{x}] = \hbar \hat{p}, \qquad i [\hat{H}, \hat{p}] = -\hbar V'(\hat{x}).&lt;/math&gt;

Assuming that observables of the coordinate and momentum obey the [[canonical commutation relation]]  {{math|[''x̂, p̂''] {{=}} ''iħ''}}. Setting &lt;math&gt;\hat{H} = H(\hat{x}, \hat{p})&lt;/math&gt;, the commutator equations can be converted into the differential equations&lt;ref name=Bondar2012 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Transtrum2005&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Transtrum | first1 = M. K. | last2 = Van Huele | first2 = J. F. O. S. | doi = 10.1063/1.1924703 | title = Commutation relations for functions of operators | journal = Journal of Mathematical Physics | volume = 46 | issue = 6 | pages = 063510 | year = 2005 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 2005JMP....46f3510T | url = http://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1371&amp;context=facpub }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;m \frac{\partial H (x,p)}{\partial p} = p, \qquad \frac{\partial H(x,p)}{\partial x} = V'(x),&lt;/math&gt;

whose solution is the familiar [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|quantum Hamiltonian]]

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{H} = \frac{\hat{p}^2}{2m} + V(\hat{x}).&lt;/math&gt;

Whence, the [[Schrödinger equation]] was derived from the Ehrenfest theorems by assuming the canonical commutation relation between the coordinate and momentum. If one assumes that the coordinate and momentum commute, the same computational method leads to the [[Koopman–von Neumann classical mechanics]], which is the [[Hilbert space]] formulation of [[classical mechanics]].&lt;ref name=Bondar2012 /&gt; Therefore, this derivation as well as the [[Koopman–von Neumann classical mechanics#Derivation starting from operator axioms|derivation of the Koopman–von Neumann mechanics]] shows that the essential difference between quantum and classical mechanics reduces to the value of the commutator {{math|[''x̂, p̂'']}}.

'''Electoral Calculus''' is a [[political forecasting]] [[web site]] which attempts to predict future [[United Kingdom general election]] results. It considers national factors but excludes local issues.

== History ==
The site was developed by Martin Baxter,&lt;ref name="intute"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.intute.ac.uk/cgi-bin/fullrecord.pl?handle=20100408-11403823 | title=Electoral Calculus | publisher=[[Intute]]  |accessdate=17 October 2011 |quote=An independent UK election prediction site maintained by Martin Baxter. He attempts to apply scientific techniques to the electoral geography of Britain to predict the future general election results.}}&lt;/ref&gt; who is a financial analyst specialising in [[mathematical modelling]].&lt;ref name="open ruppert 2010"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ruppert|first=Evelyn|title=Data mobilisation and the UK 2010 Election|url=http://www.open.ac.uk/blogs/cresc/?p=17|work=CReSC: The Social Life of Methods|publisher=[[Centre for Research on Socio-Cultural Change]]|date=16 April 2010|accessdate=28 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110910073110/http://www.open.ac.uk/blogs/cresc/?p=17|archive-date=10 September 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Main features ==

The site includes maps, predictions and analysis articles. It has a separate section for [[elections in Scotland]].&lt;ref name="keele"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.keele.ac.uk/depts/por/scotland.htm | title=Scottish Government and Politics on the Internet | publisher=[[Keele University]] | work=School of Politics, International Relations and Philosophy website | accessdate=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methodology ==

The site is based around the employment of scientific techniques on data about Britain's electoral geography,&lt;ref name="intute" /&gt; which can be used to calculate the [[uniform national swing]].&lt;ref name="telegraph young 2010"&gt;{{cite news|last=Young|first=Toby|title=Who predicted the result correctly?|url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/tobyyoung/100038566/who-predicted-the-result-correctly/|accessdate=25 May 2012|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=7 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It takes account of national polls and trends but excludes local issues.&lt;ref name="thisiskent 2012"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.thisiskent.co.uk/MP-s-course-lose-seat/story-15932772-detail/story.html | archive-url=https://archive.is/20130505065719/http://www.thisiskent.co.uk/MP-s-course-lose-seat/story-15932772-detail/story.html | dead-url=yes | archive-date=5 May 2013 | title=MP's on course to lose his seat | work=thisiskent.co.uk | publisher=[[Northcliffe Media]] | date=27 April 2012 | accessdate=24 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The calculations were initially based on what is termed the ''Transition Model'', which is derived from the additive [[uniform national swing]] model. This uses national swings in a proportional manner to predict local effects.&lt;ref name="electoralcalculus newmodel"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.electoralcalculus.co.uk/newmodel.html | title=Transition Model |publisher=Electoral Calculus |date=8 July 2004 |accessdate=17 October 2011 |last=Baxter |first=Martin}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Strong Transition Model'' was introduced in October 2007, and considers the effects of strong and weak supporters.&lt;ref name="electoralcalculus strongmodel"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.electoralcalculus.co.uk/strongmodel.html | title=Strong Transition Model |publisher=Electoral Calculus |date=28 October 2007 |accessdate=17 October 2011 |last=Baxter |first=Martin}}&lt;/ref&gt; The models are explained in detail on the web site.&lt;ref name="electoralcalculus newmodel" /&gt;

== Reception ==

It was listed by ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 2004 as one of the "100 most useful websites", being "the best" for predictions.&lt;ref name="guardian 2004"&gt;{{cite news|title=Cream of the crop|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2004/dec/16/onlinesupplement.shopping|accessdate=28 May 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=16 December 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 it was described by PhD student Chris Prosser at the [[University of Oxford]] as "probably the leading vote/seat predictor on the internet".&lt;ref name="politicsinspires prosser 2012"&gt;{{cite web|last=Prosser|first=Chris|title=Predicting the next UK general election|url=http://politicsinspires.org/2012/05/predicting-the-next-uk-general-election/|work=Politics in Spires|date=7 May 2012|accessdate=25 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its detailed predictions for individual seats have been noted by Paul Evans on the localdemocracy.org.uk [[blog]].&lt;ref name="localdemocracy evans 2010"&gt;{{cite web|last=Evans |first=Paul |title=Election websites to watch |url=http://blog.localdemocracy.org.uk/2010/03/30/election-websites-to-watch/ |work=localdemocracy.org.uk |date=30 March 2010 |accessdate=25 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140921111914/http://blog.localdemocracy.org.uk/2010/03/30/election-websites-to-watch/ |archivedate=21 September 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Academic [[Nick Anstead]] noted in his observations from a 2010 ''Personal Democracy Forum'' event, that [[Mick Fealty]] of [[Slugger O'Toole]] considered Electoral Calculus to be "massively improved" in comparison with the [[swingometer]].&lt;ref name="nickanstead.com 2010"&gt;{{cite web|last=Anstead|first=Nick|authorlink=Nick Anstead|title=General Election 2010 – Action Replay (Personal Democracy Forum Event at the Royal Society for the Arts)|url=http://www.nickanstead.com/blog/?p=1886|work=nickanstead.com|date=15 May 2010|accessdate=25 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With reference to the [[2010 United Kingdom general election]], it was cited by journalists [[Andrew Rawnsley]]&lt;ref name="guardian doubly hung "&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/nov/22/andrew-rawnsley-general-election-hung-parliament | title=Why it's very likely the next parliament will be doubly hung |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=22 November 2009 |accessdate=17 October 2011 |last=Rawnsley |first=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Rawnsley | location=London | quote=The different formulas used by Electoral Calculus and Swingo both translate a six-point Tory poll lead into a Commons in which the Conservatives are short of a majority.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Michael White (journalist)|Michael White]]&lt;ref name="guardian too late for labour"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2010/apr/30/tony-blair-labour-cleggmania-michael-white | title=Tony Blair's back.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7377">In [[model theory]], a branch of [[mathematical logic]], two [[Structure (mathematical logic)|structure]]s ''M'' and ''N'' of the same [[signature (mathematical logic)|signature]] σ are called '''elementarily equivalent''' if they satisfy the same [[first-order logic|first-order]] [[σ-sentence]]s.

If ''N'' is a [[substructure (mathematics)|substructure]] of ''M'', one often needs a stronger condition. In this case ''N'' is called an '''elementary substructure''' of ''M'' if every first-order σ-formula φ(''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;…,&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) with parameters ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;…,&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; from ''N'' is true in ''N'' if and only if it is true in&amp;nbsp;''M''.
If ''N'' is an elementary substructure of ''M'', ''M'' is called an '''elementary extension''' of&amp;nbsp;''N''. An [[embedding#Universal algebra and model theory|embedding]] ''h'':&amp;nbsp;''N''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''M'' is called an '''elementary embedding''' of ''N'' into ''M'' if ''h''(''N'') is an elementary substructure of&amp;nbsp;''M''.

A substructure ''N'' of ''M'' is elementary if and only if it passes the '''Tarski–Vaught test''': every first-order formula φ(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;…,&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) with parameters in ''N'' that has a solution in ''M'' also has a solution in&amp;nbsp;''N'' when evaluated in&amp;nbsp;''M''. One can prove that two structures are elementary equivalent with the [[Ehrenfeucht–Fraïssé games]].

==Elementarily equivalent structures==
Two structures ''M'' and ''N'' of the same signature&amp;nbsp;σ are '''elementarily equivalent''' if every first-order sentence (formula without free variables) over&amp;nbsp;σ is true in ''M'' if and only if it is true in ''N'', i.e. if ''M'' and ''N'' have the same [[complete theory|complete]] first-order theory.
If ''M'' and ''N'' are elementarily equivalent, one writes ''M''&amp;nbsp;≡&amp;nbsp;''N''.

A first-order [[theory (mathematical logic)|theory]] is complete if and only if any two of its models are elementarily equivalent.

For example, consider the language with one binary relation symbol '&lt;'.  The model '''R''' of [[real numbers]] with its usual order and the model '''Q''' of [[rational numbers]] with its usual order are elementarily equivalent, since they both interpret '&lt;' as an unbounded dense [[linear ordering]]. This is sufficient to ensure elementary equivalence, because the theory of unbounded dense linear orderings is complete, as can be shown by [[Vaught's test]].

More generally, any first-order theory with an infinite model has non-isomorphic, elementary equivalent models, which can be obtained via the [[Löwenheim–Skolem theorem]]. Thus, for example, there are [[Non-standard model of arithmetic|non-standard models]] of [[Peano arithmetic]], which contain other objects than just the numbers 0, 1, 2, etc., and yet are elementarily equivalent to the standard model.

==Elementary substructures and elementary extensions==
''N'' is an '''elementary substructure''' of ''M'' if ''N'' and ''M'' are structures of the same [[signature (mathematical logic)|signature]]&amp;nbsp;σ such that for all first-order σ-formulas φ(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;…,&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) with free variables ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;…,&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, and all elements ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;…,&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; of&amp;nbsp;''N'', φ(''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;…,&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) holds in ''N'' if and only if it holds in ''M'':
:''N'' &lt;math&gt;\models&lt;/math&gt; φ(''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;…,&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) iff ''M'' &lt;math&gt;\models&lt;/math&gt; φ(''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;…,&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;).
It follows that ''N'' is a substructure of ''M''.

If ''N'' is a substructure of ''M'', then both ''N'' and ''M'' can be interpreted as structures in the signature σ&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt; consisting of σ together with a new constant symbol for every element of&amp;nbsp;''N''. ''N'' is an elementary substructure of ''M'' if and only if ''N'' is a substructure of ''M'' and ''N'' and ''M'' are elementarily equivalent as σ&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;-structures.

If ''N'' is an elementary substructure of ''M'', one writes ''N'' &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt; ''M'' and says that ''M'' is an '''elementary extension''' of ''N'': ''M'' &lt;math&gt;\succeq&lt;/math&gt; ''N''.

The downward [[Löwenheim–Skolem theorem]] gives a countable elementary substructure for any infinite first-order structure in at most countable signature; the upward Löwenheim–Skolem theorem gives elementary extensions of any infinite first-order structure of arbitrarily large cardinality.

==Tarski–Vaught test==
The '''Tarski–Vaught test''' (or '''Tarski–Vaught criterion''') is a necessary and sufficient condition for a substructure ''N'' of a structure ''M'' to be an elementary substructure. It can be useful for constructing an elementary substructure of a large structure.

Let ''M'' be a structure of signature σ and ''N'' a substructure of ''M''. ''N'' is an elementary substructure of ''M'' if and only if for every first-order formula φ(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;…,&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) over σ and all elements ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;…,&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; from ''N'', if ''M'' &lt;math&gt;\models&lt;/math&gt; {{exist}}''x''&amp;nbsp;φ(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;…,&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;), then there is an element ''a'' in ''N'' such that ''M'' &lt;math&gt;\models&lt;/math&gt;φ(''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;…,&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;).

==Elementary embeddings==
An '''elementary embedding''' of a structure ''N'' into a structure ''M'' of the same signature σ is a map ''h'':&amp;nbsp;''N''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''M'' such that for every first-order σ-formula φ(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;…,&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) and all elements ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;…,&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; of&amp;nbsp;''N'', 
:''N'' &lt;math&gt;\models&lt;/math&gt; φ(''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;…,&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) if and only if ''M'' &lt;math&gt;\models&lt;/math&gt; φ(''h''(''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;),&amp;nbsp;…,&amp;nbsp;''h''(''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)).
Every elementary embedding is a [[Structure (mathematical logic)#Homomorphisms|strong homomorphism]], and its image is an elementary substructure.

Elementary embeddings are the most important maps in model theory.  In [[set theory]], elementary embeddings whose domain is ''V'' (the universe of set theory) play an important role in the theory of [[large cardinals]] (see also [[critical point (set theory)|critical point]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1651">The '''fluent calculus''' is a formalism for expressing dynamical domains in [[first-order logic]]. It is a variant of the [[situation calculus]]; the main difference is that situations are considered representations of states. A binary function symbol &lt;math&gt;\circ&lt;/math&gt; is used to concatenate the terms that represent facts that hold in a situation. For example, that the box is on the table in the situation &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; is represented by the formula &lt;math&gt;\exists t . s = on(box,table) \circ t&lt;/math&gt;. The [[frame problem]] is solved by asserting that the situation after the execution of an action is identical to the one before but for the conditions changed by the action. For example, the action of moving the box from the table to the floor is formalized as:

: &lt;math&gt;State(Do(move(box,table,floor), s)) \circ on(box,table) = State(s) \circ on(box,floor)&lt;/math&gt;

This formula states that the state after the move is added the term &lt;math&gt;on(box,floor)&lt;/math&gt; and removed the term &lt;math&gt;on(box,table)&lt;/math&gt;. Axioms specifying that &lt;math&gt;\circ&lt;/math&gt; is commutative and non-idempotent are necessary for such axioms to work.

The book is published in two volumes as Volume I and Volume II. Jyeshthadeva's Yuktibhasa discusses various topics in mathematics and astronomy and it is purported to be an enunciation of the rationales underlying the various mathematical assertions and the astronomical concepts and computations in the great treatise [[Tantrasamgraha]] of [[Nilakantha Somayaji]] (1444–1544). (An edition of the mathematical portion of [[Yuktibhasa]] with some explanatory notes in [[Malayalam]] had appeared in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;''Yuktibhâsâ, Part I'' (ed) with notes by Ramavarma (Maru) Thampuran and A. R. Akhileswara Aiyer, Magalodayam Ltd., [[Trichur]], [[Kerala]],  1123 [[Malayalam Era]], 1948 [[BCE|CE]].&lt;/ref&gt;)
*In addition to Jyshthadeva's Yuktibhasa, [[Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics]] had produced another work called '''Ganita Yuktibhasa'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=K.V. Sarma|author2=S.

The date of composition and the name of the author of this work in [[Sanskrit]] have not been determined with certainty. The book appears to be of a later period and seems to have been  composed as a somewhat rough Sanskrit translation of the Malayalam original [[Yuktibhasa]].

==More on ''Ganita-yukti-bhasa (Rationales in Mathematical Astronomy) of Jyesthadeva''==

This edition of [[Yuktibhasa]] has been divided into two volumes, even though the original [[Malayalam]] text has no such division. Volume I deals with  mathematics and Volume II treats astronomy. Each volume is divided into three parts: First part is an [[English language|English]] translation of the relevant [[Malayalam]] part of [[Yuktibhasa]], second part contains  detailed explanatory notes on the translation,  and in the third part the text in the [[Malayalam]] original is reproduced. The [[English language|English]] translation is by [[K.V. Sarma]] and the explanatory notes are provided by Ramasubramanian, K., Srinivas, M.D. and Sriram, M.S..

Volume I dealing with mathematics is divided into seven chapters. The topics discussed are the eight mathematical operations, a certain set of ten problems, arithmetic of fractions, rule of three, [[Kuṭṭaka|Kuttakara]] (linear indeterminate equations), infinite series and approximations for the ratio of the circumference and diameter of a circle and infinite series and approximations for sines.&lt;ref name="Kinokuniya DataBase"&gt;For more details on contents see Kinokuniya DataBase: {{cite web|url=http://bookwebpro.kinokuniya.co.jp/booksea.cgi?ISBN=1848820720http://www.buscalibros.cl/libro.php?libro=2104208|title=Ganita-yukti-bhasa (Rationales in Mathematical Astronomy) of Jyesthadeva|accessdate=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Volume II dealing with astronomy is divided into eight chapters. The topics covered are computation of mean and true longitudes of planets, Earth and celestial spheres, fifteen problems relating to ascension, declination, longitude, etc.,  determination of time, place, direction, etc., from gnomonic shadow, eclipses, Vyatipata (when the sun and moon have the same declination), visibility correction for planets  and phases of the moon.&lt;ref name="Kinokuniya DataBase"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3618">In [[mathematics]], a [[polynomial sequence]] &lt;math&gt;\{p_n(z) \}&lt;/math&gt; has a '''generalized Appell representation''' if the [[generating function]] for the [[polynomial]]s takes on a certain form:

:&lt;math&gt;K(z,w) = A(w)\Psi(zg(w)) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty p_n(z) w^n
&lt;/math&gt;
where the generating function or [[kernel (category theory)|kernel]] &lt;math&gt;K(z,w)&lt;/math&gt; is composed of the series 

:&lt;math&gt;A(w)= \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n w^n \quad&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;a_0 \ne 0 &lt;/math&gt;

and 
:&lt;math&gt;\Psi(t)= \sum_{n=0}^\infty \Psi_n t^n \quad&lt;/math&gt; and all &lt;math&gt;\Psi_n \ne 0 &lt;/math&gt;

and
:&lt;math&gt;g(w)= \sum_{n=1}^\infty g_n w^n \quad&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;g_1 \ne 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Given the above, it is not hard to show that &lt;math&gt;p_n(z)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Degree of a polynomial|polynomial of degree]] &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.

[[Boas–Buck polynomials]] are a slightly more general class of polynomials.

==Special cases==
* The choice of &lt;math&gt;g(w)=w&lt;/math&gt; gives the class of [[Brenke polynomials]].
* The choice of &lt;math&gt;\Psi(t)=e^t&lt;/math&gt; results in the [[Sheffer sequence]] of polynomials, which include the [[general difference polynomials]], such as the [[Newton polynomials]].
* The combined choice of &lt;math&gt;g(w)=w&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Psi(t)=e^t&lt;/math&gt; gives the [[Appell sequence]] of polynomials.

==Explicit representation==
The generalized Appell polynomials have the explicit representation

:&lt;math&gt;p_n(z) = \sum_{k=0}^n z^k \Psi_k h_k.&lt;/math&gt;

The constant is

:&lt;math&gt;h_k=\sum_{P} a_{j_0} g_{j_1} g_{j_2} \cdots g_{j_k} &lt;/math&gt;

where this sum extends over all [[Composition (combinatorics)|compositions]] of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;k+1&lt;/math&gt; parts; that is, the sum extends over all &lt;math&gt;\{j\}&lt;/math&gt; such that

:&lt;math&gt;j_0+j_1+ \cdots +j_k = n.\,&lt;/math&gt;

For the Appell polynomials, this becomes the formula 

:&lt;math&gt;p_n(z) = \sum_{k=0}^n \frac {a_{n-k} z^k} {k!}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Recursion relation==
Equivalently, a necessary and sufficient condition that the kernel &lt;math&gt;K(z,w)&lt;/math&gt; can be written as &lt;math&gt;A(w)\Psi(zg(w))&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;g_1=1&lt;/math&gt; is that

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial K(z,w)}{\partial w} = 
c(w) K(z,w)+\frac{zb(w)}{w} \frac{\partial K(z,w)}{\partial z}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;b(w)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c(w)&lt;/math&gt; have the power series

:&lt;math&gt;b(w) = \frac{w}{g(w)} \frac {d}{dw} g(w)
= 1 + \sum_{n=1}^\infty b_n w^n&lt;/math&gt;

and 

:&lt;math&gt;c(w) = \frac{1}{A(w)} \frac {d}{dw} A(w)
= \sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n w^n.&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting 

:&lt;math&gt;K(z,w)= \sum_{n=0}^\infty p_n(z) w^n&lt;/math&gt;

immediately gives the [[recursion relation]]

:&lt;math&gt; z^{n+1} \frac {d}{dz} \left[ \frac{p_n(z)}{z^n} \right]= 
-\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} c_{n-k-1} p_k(z) 
-z \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} b_{n-k} \frac{d}{dz} p_k(z).
&lt;/math&gt;

For the special case of the Brenke polynomials, one has &lt;math&gt;g(w)=w&lt;/math&gt; and thus all of the &lt;math&gt;b_n=0&lt;/math&gt;, simplifying the recursion relation significantly.

In [[mathematics]], the '''Heine–Cantor theorem''', named after [[Eduard Heine]] and [[Georg Cantor]], states that if ''f'' : ''M'' → ''N'' is a [[continuous function]] between two [[metric space]]s, and ''M'' is  [[compact space|compact]], then ''f'' is [[uniformly continuous]]. An important special case is that every continuous function from a [[bounded set|bounded]] [[closed interval]] to the [[real number]]s is uniformly continuous.

==Proof==

Suppose that &lt;math&gt; M &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; N &lt;/math&gt; are two metric spaces with metrics &lt;math&gt; d_M &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; d_N &lt;/math&gt;, respectively. Suppose further that &lt;math&gt;f: M \to N&lt;/math&gt; is continuous, and that &lt;math&gt; M &lt;/math&gt; is compact. We want to show that &lt;math&gt; f &lt;/math&gt; is uniformly continuous, that is, for every &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; there exists &lt;math&gt; \delta &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt; such that for all points &lt;math&gt; x, y &lt;/math&gt; in the domain &lt;math&gt; M &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; d_M(x,y) &lt; \delta &lt;/math&gt; implies that &lt;math&gt; d_N(f(x), f(y)) &lt; \varepsilon &lt;/math&gt;.

Fix some positive &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;. Then by continuity, for any point &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; in our domain &lt;math&gt; M &lt;/math&gt;, there exists a positive real number &lt;math&gt; \delta_x &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; d_N(f(x),f(y)) &lt; \varepsilon/2 &lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt; y &lt;/math&gt; is within &lt;math&gt; \delta_x &lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt; U_x &lt;/math&gt; be the open &lt;math&gt;\delta_x/2&lt;/math&gt;-neighborhood of &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt;, i.e. the set

:&lt;math&gt; U_x = \left\{ y \mid d_M(x,y) &lt; \frac 1 2 \delta_x \right\} &lt;/math&gt;

Since each point &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt;  is contained in its own &lt;math&gt; U_x &lt;/math&gt;, we find that the collection &lt;math&gt; \{U_x \mid x \in M\}&lt;/math&gt; is an open cover of &lt;math&gt; M &lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt; M &lt;/math&gt; is compact, this cover has a finite subcover. That subcover must be of the form 

:&lt;math&gt; U_{x_1}, U_{x_2}, \ldots, U_{x_n} &lt;/math&gt;

for some finite set of points &lt;math&gt; \{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\} \subset M &lt;/math&gt;. Each of these open sets has an associated radius &lt;math&gt; \delta_{x_i}/2 &lt;/math&gt;. Let us now define &lt;math&gt; \delta = \min_{1 \leq i \leq n} \frac{1}{2}\delta_{x_i} &lt;/math&gt;, i.e. the minimum radius of these open sets. Since we have a finite number of positive radii, this number &lt;math&gt; \delta &lt;/math&gt; is well-defined and positive. We may now show that this &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; works for the definition of uniform continuity.

Suppose that &lt;math&gt; d_M(x,y) &lt; \delta &lt;/math&gt; for any two &lt;math&gt; x, y &lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt; M &lt;/math&gt;. Since the sets &lt;math&gt;U_{x_i}&lt;/math&gt; form an open (sub)cover of our space &lt;math&gt; M &lt;/math&gt;, we know that &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; must lie within one of them, say &lt;math&gt; U_{x_i} &lt;/math&gt;. Then we have that &lt;math&gt; d_M(x, x_i) &lt; \frac{1}{2}\delta_{x_i} &lt;/math&gt;. The Triangle Inequality then implies that

:&lt;math&gt; d_M(x_i, y) \leq d_M(x_i, x) + d_M(x, y) &lt; \frac{1}{2} \delta_{x_i} + \delta \leq \delta_{x_i} &lt;/math&gt;

implying that &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; y &lt;/math&gt; are both at most &lt;math&gt;\delta_{x_i}&lt;/math&gt; away from &lt;math&gt; x_i &lt;/math&gt;. By definition of &lt;math&gt;\delta_{x_i}&lt;/math&gt;, this implies that &lt;math&gt; d_N(f(x_i),f(x)) &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; d_N(f(x_i), f(y)) &lt;/math&gt; are both less than &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon/2&lt;/math&gt;. Applying the Triangle Inequality then yields the desired

:&lt;math&gt; d_N(f(x), f(y)) \leq d_N(f(x_i), f(x)) + d_N(f(x_i), f(y)) &lt; \frac 1 2 \varepsilon + \frac 1 2 \varepsilon = \varepsilon &lt;/math&gt;

For an alternative proof in the case of &lt;math&gt; M = [ a, b] &lt;/math&gt; a closed interval, see the article on [[Non-standard calculus#Heine.E2.80.93Cantor theorem|non-standard calculus]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8790">In [[geometry]], a '''hypersurface''' is a generalization of the concepts of [[hyperplane]], [[plane curve]], and [[surface (mathematics)|surface]]. A hypersurface is a [[manifold]] or an [[algebraic variety]] of dimension {{math|''n'' − 1}}, which is embedded in an ambient space of dimension {{math|''n''}}, generally a [[Euclidean space]], an [[affine space]] or a [[projective space]].
Hypersurfaces share, with surfaces in a [[three-dimensional space]], the property of being defined by a single [[implicit equation]], at least locally (near every point), and sometimes globally.

A hypersurface in a (Euclidean, affine, or projective) space of dimension two is a plane curve. In a space of dimension three, it is a surface. 

For example, the equation
:&lt;math&gt;x_1^2+x_2^2+\cdots+x_n^2-1=0&lt;/math&gt;
defines an algebraic hypersurface of [[dimension of an algebraic variety|dimension]] {{math|''n'' − 1}} in the Euclidean space of dimension {{math|''n''}}. This hypersurface is also a [[smooth manifold]], and is  called a [[hypersphere]] or an [[n-sphere|{{math|(''n'' – 1)}}-sphere]].

==Smooth hypersurface==

A hypersurface that is a [[smooth manifold]] is called a ''smooth hypersurface''.

In {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, a smooth hypersurface is [[Orientability|orientable]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Hans Samelson]] (1969) [http://www.ams.org/journals/proc/1969-022-01/S0002-9939-1969-0245026-9/S0002-9939-1969-0245026-9.pdf "Orientability of hypersurfaces in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;]", ''[[Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society]]'' 22(1): 301,2 &lt;/ref&gt; Every [[connected space|connected]] [[compact space|compact]] smooth hypersurface is a [[level set]], and separates '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; into two connected components; this is related to the [[Jordan curve theorem#Proof and generalizations|Jordan–Brouwer separation theorem]].&lt;ref name="Lima"&gt;Elon L. Lima,
"The Jordan-Brouwer separation theorem for smooth hypersurfaces", ''The American Mathematical Monthly'', Vol. 95, No. 1 (Jan., 1988), pp.&amp;nbsp;39–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Affine algebraic hypersurface {{anchor|Algebraic hypersurface}}==

An '''algebraic hypersurface''' is an [[algebraic variety]] that may be defined by a single implicit equation of the form
:&lt;math&gt;p(x_1, \ldots, x_n)=0,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|p}} is a [[multivariate polynomial]]. Generally the polynomial is supposed to be [[irreducible polynomial|irreducible]]. When it is not the case, the hypersurface is not an algebraic variety, but only an [[algebraic set]]. It may depend on the authors or the context whether a reducible polynomial defines a hypersurface. For avoiding ambiguity, the terms ''irreducible hypersurface'' is often used. 

As for algebraic varieties, the coefficients of the defining polynomial may belong to any fixed [[field (mathematics)|field]] {{mvar|k}}, and the points of the hypersurface are the [[zero of a function|zeros]] of {{mvar|p}} in the [[affine space]] &lt;math&gt;K^n,&lt;/math&gt; where {{mvar|K}} is an [[algebraically closed extension]] of {{mvar|k}}.

A hypersurface may have [[singular point of an algebraic variety|singularities]], which are the common zeros, if any, of the defining polynomial and its partial derivatives. In particular, a real algebraic hypersurface is not necessarily a manifold.

===Properties===
Hypersurfaces have some specific properties that are not shared with other algebraic varieties. 

One of the main such properties is [[Hilbert's Nullstellensatz]], which asserts that a hypersurface contains an [[algebraic set]] if and only if the defining polynomial of the hypersurface has a power that belongs to the [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] generated by the defining polynomials of the algebraic set.

A corollary of this theorem is that, if two [[irreducible polynomial]]s (or more generally two [[square-free polynomial]]s) define the same hypersurface, then one is the product of the other by a nonzero constant.

Hypersurfaces are exactly the subvarieties of [[dimension of an algebraic variety|dimension]] {{math|''n'' – 1}} of an [[affine space]] of dimension of {{mvar|n}}. This is the geometric interpretation of the fact that, in a polynomial ring over a field, the [[height (ring theory)|height]] of an ideal is 1 if and only if the ideal is a [[principal ideal]]. In the case of possibly reducible hypersurfaces, this result may be restated as follows: hypersurfaces are exactly the algebraic sets whose all irreducible components have dimension {{math|''n'' – 1}}.

===Real and rational points ===
A ''real hypersurface'' is a hypersurface that is defined by a polynomial with [[real number|real]] coefficients. In this case the algebraically closed field over which the points are defined is generally the field &lt;math&gt;\Bbb C&lt;/math&gt; of complex numbers. The ''real points'' of a real hypersurface are the points that belong to &lt;math&gt;\Bbb R^n \subset \Bbb C^n.&lt;/math&gt; The set of the real points of a real hypersurface is the ''real part'' of the hypersurface. Often, it is left to the context whether the term ''hypersurface'' refers to all points or only to the real part.

If the coefficients of the defining polynomial belong to a field {{mvar|k}} that is not [[algebraically closed field|algebraically closed]] (typically the field of [[rational number]]s, a [[finite field]] or a [[number field]]), one says that the hypersurface is ''defined over'' {{mvar|k}}, and the points that belong to &lt;math&gt;k^n&lt;/math&gt; are ''rational'' over {{mvar|k}} (in the case of the field of rational numbers, "over {{mvar|k}}" is generally omitted).

For example, the imaginary [[n-sphere|{{mvar|n}}-sphere]] defined by the equation
:&lt;math&gt;x_0^2 +\cdots+x_n^2 +1=0&lt;/math&gt;
is a real hypersurface without any real point, which is defined over the rational numbers. It has no rational point, but has many points that are rational over the [[Gaussian rational]]s.

==Projective algebraic hypersurface{{anchor|projective hypersurface}}==

A {{em|projective (algebraic) hypersurface}} of dimension {{math|''n'' – 1}} in a [[projective space]] of dimension {{mvar|n}} over a field {{mvar|k}} is defined by a [[homogeneous polynomial]] &lt;math&gt;P(x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_n)&lt;/math&gt; in {{math|''n'' + 1}} indeterminates. As usual, {{em|homogeneous polynomial}} means that all [[monomial]]s of {{mvar|P}} have the same degree, or, equivalently that &lt;math&gt;P(cx_0, cx_1, \ldots, cx_n)=c^dP(x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_n)&lt;/math&gt; for every constant {{mvar|c}}, where {{math|d}} is the degree of the polynomial. The {{em|points}} of the hypersurface are the points of the projective space whose [[projective coordinates]] are zeros of {{mvar|P}}.

If one chooses the [[hyperplane]] of equation &lt;math&gt;x_0=0&lt;/math&gt; as [[hyperplane at infinity]], the complement of this hyperplane is an [[affine space]], and the points of the projective hypersuface that belong to this affine space form an affine hypersurface of equation &lt;math&gt;P(1, x_1, \ldots, x_n) = 0.&lt;/math&gt; Conversely, given an affine hypersurface of equation &lt;math&gt;p(x_1, \ldots, x_n)=0,&lt;/math&gt; it defines a projective hypersurface, called its {{em|projective completion}}, whose equation is obtained by [[Homogeneous polynomial#Homogenization|homogenizing]] {{mvar|p}}. That is, the equation of the projective completion is &lt;math&gt;P(x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_n) = 0,&lt;/math&gt; with 
:&lt;math&gt;P(x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_n) = x_0^dp(x_1/x_0, \ldots, x_n/x_0),&lt;/math&gt; 
where {{mvar|d}} is the degree of {{mvar|P}}.

These two processes projective completion and restriction to an affine subspace are inverse one to the other. Therefore, an affine hypersurface and its projective completion have essentially the same properties, and are often considered as two points-of-view for the same hypersurface. 

However, it may occur that an affine hypersurface is [[singular point of an algebraic variety|nonsingular]], while its projective completion has singular points. In this case, one says that the affine surface is {{em|singular at infinity}}. For example, the [[circular cylinder]] of equation 
:&lt;math&gt;x^2+y^2-1=0&lt;/math&gt; 
in the affine space of dimension three has a unique singular point, which is at infinity, in the direction {{math|1=''x'' = 0, ''y'' = 0}}.

[[File:Montucla - Histoire des mathématiques, 1758 - 277.tif|thumb|''Histoire des mathématiques'', [[1758]].]]
'''Jean-Étienne Montucla''' (5 September 1725 – 18 December 1799) was a [[France|French]] [[mathematician]] and historian.

==Biography==
Montucla was born at [[Lyon]].

In 1754 he published an anonymous treatise on [[quadrature (mathematics)|quadrature]], ''Histoire des recherches sur la quadrature du cercle''.&lt;ref&gt;J. Montucla (1873) [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433069092124;view=1up;seq=19 History of the Quadrature of the Circle], J. Babin translator, William Alexander Myers editor, link from [[HathiTrust]]&lt;/ref&gt; Montucla's deep interest in [[history of mathematics]] became apparent with his publication of ''Histoire des Mathématiques'', the first part appearing in 1758. According to [[George Sarton]], the ''Histoire'' is
:a history of the mathematical sciences, and might almost be called a [[history of science]] from the mathematical angle, even as many histories of medicine are to some extent histories of science written from the medical angle.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Sarton]] (1936) ''Jean-Etienne Montucla (1725–1799). His Life and Works'', [[Osiris (journal)|Osiris]] 1: 519–67&lt;/ref&gt;

He was appointed intendant-secretary of [[Grenoble]] in 1758, secretary to the expedition for colonizing [[Cayenne]] in 1764, and chief architect and censor-royal for mathematical books in 1765.

The [[French Revolution]] deprived him of his income and left him in great destitution. The offer in 1795 of a mathematical chair in one of the schools of Paris was declined on account of his infirm health, and he was still in straightened circumstances in 1798, when he published a second edition of the first part of his ''Histoire''.

In 1778 he re-edited [[Jacques Ozanam]]'s ''Recreations mathématiques'', afterwards published in English by [[Charles Hutton]] (4 vols, London, 1803). After his death, his ''Histoire'' was completed by [[Jérôme Lalande]], and published at Paris in 1799–1802 (4 vols).

[[Ivor Grattan-Guinness]] described the ''Histoire'' as a milestone:
:His first volume covered Greek, Roman, and Eastern traditions, while the second covered geometry, mechanics and optics up to the seventeenth century. Forty years later the second edition began to appear, although the author then died and task of completion fell to Jérôme Lalande. With the help of various colleagues, he completed  the third volume and wrote the fourth within four years. The first two volumes covered the same material as before, while the other two handled all aspects of the eighteenth century; the whole encompassed around 3000 pages, including indexes (themselves an excellent feature)...One curious feature of the work, especially in chapters on applied mathematics, is the lack of mathematical symbolism in the text: Montucla and Lalande were often content with a verbal account of the work without entering into symbolic renderings. Of course many basic aspects of the history of mathematics were thus left out.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ivor Grattan-Guinness]] (1994) ''Companion Encyclopedia of the History and Philosophy of the Mathematical Sciences'', volume 2, page 1666, [[Routledge]] {{ISBN|0-415-09239-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the theory of [[dynamical systems]] and [[control theory]], a [[linear system|linear]] [[time-invariant system]] is '''marginally stable''' if it is neither [[asymptotically stable]] nor [[unstable]]. Roughly speaking, a system is stable if it always returns to and stays near a particular state (called the [[steady state]]), and is unstable if it goes farther and farther away from any state, without being bounded. A marginal system, sometimes referred to as having neutral stability,&lt;ref name="FranklinPowell2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gene F. Franklin|author2=J. David Powell|author3=Abbas Emami-Naeini|title=Feedback Control of Dynamic Systems|edition=5|year=2006|publisher=Pearson Education|isbn=0-13-149930-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; is between these two types: when displaced, it does not return to near a common steady state, nor does it go away from where it started without limit.

Marginal stability, like instability, is a feature that control theory seeks to avoid; we wish that, when perturbed by some external force, a system will return to a desired state. This necessitates the use of appropriately designed control algorithms.

In [[econometrics]], the presence of a [[unit root]] in observed [[time series]], rendering them marginally stable, can lead to invalid [[regression analysis|regression]] results regarding effects of the [[independent variable]]s upon a [[dependent variable]], unless appropriate techniques are used to convert the system to a stable system.

==Continuous time==
A [[homogeneous differential equation|homogeneous]] [[continuous time|continuous]] [[linear time-invariant system]] is marginally stable [[if and only if]] the real part of every [[Pole (complex analysis)|pole]] ([[eigenvalue]]) in the system's [[transfer-function]] is [[non-positive]], one or more poles have zero real part, and all poles with zero real part are [[simple root]]s (i.e. the poles on the [[complex plane|imaginary axis]] are all distinct from one another). In contrast, if all the poles have strictly negative real parts, the system is instead asymptotically stable. If one or more poles have positive real parts, the system is unstable.

If the system is in [[state space representation]], marginal stability can be analyzed by deriving the [[Jordan normal form]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cds.caltech.edu/~murray/amwiki/index.php/Linear_Systems |title=Linear Systems |work=Feedback Systems Wiki |author=Karl J. Åström and Richard M. Murray|publisher=Caltech|accessdate=11 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; if and only if the Jordan blocks corresponding to poles with zero real part are scalar is the system marginally stable.

==Discrete time==
A homogeneous [[discrete time]] linear time-invariant system is marginally stable if and only if the greatest magnitude of any of the poles (eigenvalues) of the transfer function is 1, and the poles with magnitude equal to 1 are all distinct. That is, the transfer function's [[spectral radius]] is 1. If the spectral radius is less than 1, the system is instead asymptotically stable.

A simple example involves a single first-order [[linear difference equation]]: Suppose a state variable ''x'' evolves according to

:&lt;math&gt;x_t=ax_{t-1}&lt;/math&gt;

with parameter ''a'' &gt; 0. If the system is perturbed to the value &lt;math&gt;x_0,&lt;/math&gt; its subsequent sequence of values is &lt;math&gt;ax_0, \, a^2x_0, \, a^3x_0, \, \dots .&lt;/math&gt; If ''a'' &lt; 1, these numbers get closer and closer to 0 regardless of the starting value &lt;math&gt;x_0,&lt;/math&gt; while if ''a'' &gt; 1 the numbers get larger and larger without bound. But if ''a'' = 1, the numbers do neither of these: instead, all future values of ''x'' equal the value &lt;math&gt;x_0.&lt;/math&gt; Thus the case ''a'' = 1 exhibits marginal stability.

==System response==
A marginally stable system is one that, if given an [[dirac delta function|impulse]] of finite magnitude as input, will not "blow up" and give an unbounded output, but neither will the output return to zero. A bounded offset or oscillations in the output will persist indefinitely, and so there will in general be no final steady-state output. If a continuous system is given an input at a frequency equal to the frequency of a pole with zero real part, the system's output will increase indefinitely (this is known as pure resonance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-03sc-differential-equations-fall-2011/unit-ii-second-order-constant-coefficient-linear-equations/pure-resonance/ | title= Pure Resonance|publisher=MIT|accessdate=2 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;). This explains why for a system to be [[BIBO stability|BIBO stable]], the real parts of the poles have to be strictly negative (and not just non-positive).

A continuous system having imaginary poles, i.e. having zero real part in the pole(s), will produce sustained oscillations in the output. For example, an undamped second-order system such as the suspension system in an automobile (a [[mass–spring–damper]] system), from which the damper has been removed and spring is ideal, i.e. no friction is there, will in theory oscillate forever once disturbed. Another example is a frictionless [[Pendulum (mathematics)|pendulum]]. A system with a pole at the origin is also marginally stable but in this case there will be no oscillation in the response as the imaginary part is also zero (''jw''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 means ''w''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0&amp;nbsp;rad/sec). An example of such a system is a mass on a surface with friction. When a sidewards impulse is applied, the mass will move and never returns to zero. The mass will come to rest due to friction however, and the sidewards movement will remain bounded.

Since the locations of the marginal poles must be ''exactly'' on the imaginary axis or unit circle (for continuous time and discrete time systems respectively) for a system to be marginally stable, this situation is unlikely to occur in practice unless marginal stability is an inherent theoretical feature of the system.

==Stochastic dynamics==

Marginal stability is also an important concept in the context of [[stochastic dynamics]]. For example, some processes may follow a [[random walk]], given in discrete time as 

:&lt;math&gt;x_t=x_{t-1}+e_t,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;e_t&lt;/math&gt; is an [[i.i.d.]] [[errors and residuals in statistics|error term]]. This equation has a [[unit root]] (a value of 1 for the eigenvalue of its [[characteristic equation (of difference equation)|characteristic equation]]), and hence exhibits marginal stability, so special [[time series]] techniques must be used in empirically modeling a system containing such an equation.

In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] discipline of [[graph theory]], the '''medial graph''' of [[plane graph]] ''G'' is another graph ''M(G)'' that represents the adjacencies between edges in the faces of ''G''.  Medial graphs were introduced in 1922 by [[Ernst Steinitz]] to study combinatorial properties of [[convex polyhedra]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Ernst|last=Steinitz|authorlink=Ernst Steinitz|contribution=Polyeder und Raumeinteilungen|title=[[Klein's encyclopedia|Encyclopädie der mathematischen Wissenschaften]], Band 3 (Geometries)|year=1922|pages=1–139}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the [[knot (mathematics)#Medial graph|inverse construction]] was already used by [[Peter Tait (physicist)|Peter Tait]] in 1877 in his foundational study of [[knot theory|knots and links]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tait|first1=Peter G.|authorlink1=Peter Tait (physicist)|title=On Knots I|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of Edinburgh|date=1876–1877|volume=28|pages=145–190|quote=Revised May 11, 1877.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tait|first1=Peter G.|authorlink1=Peter Tait (physicist)|title=On Links (Abstract)|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of Edinburgh|date=1876–1877|volume=9|issue=98|pages=321–332}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formal definition ==
Given a connected [[plane graph]] ''G'', its medial graph ''M(G)'' has
* a vertex for each edge of ''G'' and
* an edge between two vertices for each face of ''G'' in which their corresponding edges occur consecutively.
The medial graph of a disconnected graph is the disjoint union of the medial graphs of each connected component.  The definition of medial graph also extends without modification to [[graph embeddings]] on surfaces of higher genus.

== Properties ==
[[File:Nonisomorphic medial graph example.svg|right|thumb|300px|The two red graphs are both medial graphs of the blue graph, but they are not [[Graph isomorphism|isomorphic]].]]
* The medial graph of any plane graph is a 4-[[regular graph|regular]] plane graph. 
* For any plane graph ''G'', the medial graph of ''G'' and the medial graph of the [[dual graph]] of ''G'' are isomorphic.  Conversely, for any 4-regular plane graph ''H'', the only two plane graphs with medial graph ''H'' are dual to each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Since the medial graph depends on a particular embedding, the medial graph of a planar graph is not unique; the same planar graph can have non-[[Graph isomorphism|isomorphic]] medial graphs. In the picture, the red graphs are not isomorphic because the two vertices with self loops share an edge in one graph but not in the other.
* Every 4-regular plane graph is the medial graph of some plane graph. For a connected 4-regular plane graph ''H'', a planar graph ''G'' with ''H'' as its medial graph can be constructed as follows.  Color the faces of ''H'' with just two colors, which is possible since ''H'' is Eulerian (and thus the dual graph of ''H'' is bipartite).  The vertices in ''G'' correspond to the faces of a single color in ''H''.  These vertices are connected by an edge for each vertex shared by their corresponding faces in ''H''.  Note that performing this construction using the faces of the other color as the vertices produces the dual graph of ''G''.

== Applications ==
For a plane graph ''G'', twice the evaluation of the [[Tutte polynomial]] at the point (3,3) equals the sum over weighted [[Eulerian orientation]]s in the medial graph of ''G'', where the weight of an orientation is 2 to the number of saddle vertices of the orientation (that is, the number of vertices with incident edges cyclically ordered "in, out, in out").&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the Tutte polynomial is invariant under embeddings, this result shows that every medial graph has the same sum of these weighted Eulerian orientations.

==Directed medial graph==
[[File:Directed medial graph example.svg|right|thumb|400px|A plane graph (in blue) and its directed medial graph (in red).]]
The medial graph definition can be extended to include an orientation. First, the faces of the medial graph are colored black if they contain a vertex of the original graph and white otherwise. This coloring causes each edge of the medial graph to be bordered by one black face and one white face. Then each edge is oriented so that the black face is on its left.

A plane graph and its dual do not have the same directed medial graph; their directed medial graphs are the [[Transpose graph|transpose]] of each other.

Using the directed medial graph, one can effectively generalize the result on evaluations of the Tutte polynomial at (3,3). For a plane graph ''G'', ''n'' times the evaluation of the [[Tutte polynomial]] at the point (''n''+1,''n''+1) equals the weighted sum over all edge colorings using ''n'' colors in the directed medial graph of ''G'' so that each (possibly empty) set of monochromatic edges forms a directed Eulerian graph, where the weight of a directed Eulerian orientation is 2 to the number of monochromatic vertices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4100">In [[abstract algebra]], a '''monadic Boolean algebra''' is an [[algebraic structure]] ''A'' with [[signature (logic)|signature]] 

:&amp;lang;&amp;middot;, +, ', 0, 1, &amp;exist;&amp;rang;   of [[signature (logic)|type]]   &amp;lang;2,2,1,0,0,1&amp;rang;,

where &amp;lang;''A'', &amp;middot;, +, ', 0, 1&amp;rang; is a [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]].

The [[monadic (arity)|monadic]]/[[unary operator]] &amp;exist; denotes the [[existential quantifier]], which satisfies the identities (using the received [[prefix]] notation for ∃):
* &amp;exist;0 = 0
* &amp;exist;''x'' &amp;ge; ''x''
* &amp;exist;(''x'' + ''y'') = &amp;exist;''x'' + &amp;exist;''y''
* &amp;exist;''x''&amp;exist;''y'' = &amp;exist;(''x''&amp;exist;''y''). 
&amp;exist;''x'' is the ''existential closure'' of ''x''. [[duality (order theory)|Dual]] to &amp;exist; is the [[unary operator]] &amp;forall;, the [[universal quantifier]], defined as &amp;forall;''x'' := (&amp;exist;''x' '')'. 

A monadic Boolean algebra has a dual definition and notation that take &amp;forall; as primitive and &amp;exist; as defined, so that  &amp;exist;''x'' := (&amp;forall;''x''&amp;nbsp;'&amp;nbsp;)'&amp;nbsp;. (Compare this with the definition of the [[duality (order theory)|dual]] Boolean algebra.) Hence, with this notation, an algebra ''A'' has signature &amp;lang;&amp;middot;, +, ', 0, 1, &amp;forall;&amp;rang;, with &amp;lang;''A'', &amp;middot;, +, ', 0, 1&amp;rang; a Boolean algebra, as before. Moreover, &amp;forall; satisfies the following [[duality (order theory)| dualized]] version of the above identities:
# &amp;forall;1 = 1
# &amp;forall;''x'' &amp;le; ''x''
# &amp;forall;(''xy'') = &amp;forall;''x''&amp;forall;''y''
# &amp;forall;''x'' + &amp;forall;''y'' = &amp;forall;(''x'' + &amp;forall;''y'').
&amp;forall;''x'' is the ''universal closure'' of ''x''.

==Discussion==
Monadic Boolean algebras have an important connection to [[topology]]. If &amp;forall; is interpreted as the [[interior operator]] of topology, (1)–(3) above plus the axiom &amp;forall;(&amp;forall;''x'') = &amp;forall;''x'' make up the axioms for an [[interior algebra]]. But &amp;forall;(&amp;forall;''x'') = &amp;forall;''x'' can be proved from (1)–(4). Moreover, an alternative axiomatization of monadic Boolean algebras consists of the (reinterpreted) axioms for an [[interior algebra]], plus &amp;forall;(&amp;forall;''x'')' = (&amp;forall;''x'')' (Halmos 1962: 22). Hence monadic Boolean algebras are the [[Semisimple algebra|semisimple]] interior/[[closure algebra]]s such that:
*The universal (dually, existential) quantifier interprets the [[interior operator|interior]] ([[closure operator|closure]]) operator;
*All open (or closed) elements are also [[clopen set|clopen]].
A more concise axiomatization of monadic Boolean algebra is (1) and (2) above, plus &amp;forall;(''x''&amp;or;&amp;forall;''y'') = &amp;forall;''x''&amp;or;&amp;forall;''y'' (Halmos 1962: 21). This axiomatization obscures the connection to topology.

Monadic Boolean algebras form a [[variety (universal algebra)|variety]]. They are to [[monadic logic|monadic predicate logic]] what [[Lindenbaum–Tarski algebra|Boolean algebra]]s are to [[propositional logic]], and what [[polyadic algebra]]s are to [[first-order logic]]. [[Paul Halmos]] discovered monadic Boolean algebras while working on polyadic algebras; Halmos (1962) reprints the relevant papers. Halmos and Givant (1998) includes an undergraduate treatment of monadic Boolean algebra.

Monadic Boolean algebras also have an important connection to [[modal logic]]. The modal logic [[modal logic|S5]], viewed as a theory in ''S4'', is a model of monadic Boolean algebras in the same way that [[modal logic|S4]] is a model of interior algebra. Likewise, monadic Boolean algebras supply the algebraic semantics for ''S5''. Hence '''S5-algebra''' is a [[synonym]] for monadic Boolean algebra.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15827">The '''obstacle problem''' is a classic motivating example in the [[mathematical]] study of [[variational inequalities]] and [[free boundary problem]]s. The problem is to find the [[Mechanical equilibrium|equilibrium]] position of an [[Solid mechanics|elastic membrane]] whose boundary is held fixed, and which is constrained to lie above a given obstacle. It is deeply related to the study of [[minimal surfaces]] and the [[capacity of a set]] in [[potential theory]] as well. Applications include the study of fluid filtration in porous media, constrained heating, elasto-plasticity, optimal control, and financial mathematics.&lt;ref name="Caf384"&gt;See {{harvnb|Caffarelli|1998|p=384}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The mathematical formulation of the problem is to seek minimizers of the [[Dirichlet energy]] functional, 
:&lt;math&gt;J = \int_D |\nabla u|^2 \mathrm{d}x&lt;/math&gt;
in some domain ''&lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;'' where the functions ''&lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;'' represent the vertical displacement of the membrane. In addition to satisfying [[Dirichlet boundary conditions]] corresponding to the fixed boundary of the membrane, the functions ''&lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;'' are in addition constrained to be greater than some given ''obstacle'' function ''&lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;''&lt;math&gt;(x)&lt;/math&gt;. The solution breaks down into a region where the solution is equal to the obstacle function, known as the ''contact set,'' and a region where the solution is above the obstacle. The interface between the two regions is the ''free boundary.''

In general, the solution is continuous and possesses [[Lipschitz continuity|Lipschitz continuous]] first derivatives, but that the solution is generally discontinuous in the second derivatives across the free boundary. The free boundary is characterized as a [[Hölder continuity|Hölder continuous]] surface except at certain singular points, which reside on a smooth manifold.

}}

==Motivating problems==
===Shape of a membrane above an obstacle===
The obstacle problem arises when one considers the shape taken by a soap film in a domain whose boundary position is fixed (see [[Plateau's problem]]), with the added constraint that the membrane is constrained to lie above some obstacle ''&lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;''&lt;math&gt;(x)&lt;/math&gt; in the interior of the domain as well.&lt;ref name="Caf383"&gt;See {{harvnb|Caffarelli|1998|p=383}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, the energy functional to be minimized is the surface area integral, or

:&lt;math&gt;J(u) = \int_D \sqrt{1 + |\nabla u|^2}\,\mathrm{d}x.&lt;/math&gt;

This problem can be ''linearized'' in the case of small perturbations by expanding the energy functional in terms of its [[Taylor series]] and taking the first term only, in which case the energy to be minimized is the standard [[Dirichlet energy]]

:&lt;math&gt;J(u) = \int_D |\nabla u|^2 \mathrm{d}x.&lt;/math&gt;

===Optimal stopping===
The obstacle problem also arises in [[control theory]], specifically the question of finding the optimal stopping time for a [[stochastic process]] with payoff function ''&lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;''&lt;math&gt;(x)&lt;/math&gt;.

In the simple case wherein the process is [[Brownian motion]], and the process is forced to stop upon exiting the domain, the solution &lt;math&gt;u(x)&lt;/math&gt; of the obstacle problem can be characterized as the expected value of the payoff, starting the process at &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, if the optimal stopping strategy is followed. The stopping criterion is simply that one should stop upon reaching the ''contact set''.&lt;ref&gt;See the lecture notes by {{harvtxt|Evans|Version 1.2| pp=110–114}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formal statement==
Suppose the following data is given:
#an [[open set|open]] [[bounded set|bounded]] [[Domain (mathematics)#Real and complex analysis|domain]] &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; ⊂ ℝ''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' with [[smooth function|smooth]] [[boundary (topology)|boundary]]
#a [[smooth function]] &lt;math&gt;f (x)&lt;/math&gt; on '''∂'''&lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; (the [[boundary (topology)|boundary]] of &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;)
#a smooth function ''&lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;''&lt;math&gt;(x)&lt;/math&gt; defined on all of &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\varphi|_{\partial D}&lt;/math&gt; &lt; &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. the restriction of ''&lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;''&lt;math&gt;(x)&lt;/math&gt; to the boundary of &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; (its [[Trace operator|trace]]) is less than &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;.
Then consider the set
:&lt;math&gt;K = \left\{ u(x) \in H^1(D): u|_{\partial D} = f(x)\text{ and } u \geq \varphi \right\},&lt;/math&gt;
which is a [[closed set|closed]] [[convex set|convex]] [[subset]] of the [[Sobolev space]] of square [[integrable function]]s with square integrable [[weak derivative|weak first derivatives]], containing precisely those functions with the desired boundary conditions which are also above the obstacle. The solution to the obstacle problem is the function which minimizes the energy [[integral]]
:&lt;math&gt;J(u) = \int_D |\nabla u|^2\mathrm{d}x&lt;/math&gt;
over all functions &lt;math&gt;u(x)&lt;/math&gt; belonging to &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;; the existence of such a minimizer is assured by considerations of [[Hilbert space]] theory.&lt;ref name="Caf383"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvnb|Kinderlehrer|Stampacchia|1980|pp=40–41}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative formulations==
===Variational inequality===
{{See also|Variational inequality}}
The obstacle problem can be reformulated as a standard problem in the theory of [[variational inequality|variational inequalities]] on [[Hilbert space]]s. Seeking the energy minimizer in the set ''&lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;'' of suitable functions is equivalent to seeking

:&lt;math&gt; u \in K&lt;/math&gt;    '''such that'''   &lt;math&gt;\int_D\langle {\nabla u} , {\nabla (v - u)}\rangle \mathrm{d}x \geq 0\qquad\forall v \in K, &lt;/math&gt;

where ⟨ . , . ⟩ : ℝ''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' × ℝ''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' → ℝ is the ordinary [[scalar product]] in the [[Dimension (mathematics)|finite-dimensional]] [[Real number|real]] [[vector space]] ℝ''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;''. This is a special case of the more general form for variational inequalities on Hilbert spaces, whose solutions are functions ''&lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;'' in some closed convex subset ''&lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;'' of the overall space, such that

:&lt;math&gt;a(u,v-u) \geq f(v-u)\qquad\forall v \in K.\,&lt;/math&gt;

for [[Coercive function|coercive]], [[Real numbers|real-valued]], [[bounded operator|bounded]] [[bilinear form]]s &lt;math&gt;a(u,v)&lt;/math&gt; and bounded [[linear functional]]s &lt;math&gt;f(v)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="KS-chapter2"&gt;See {{harvnb|Kinderlehrer|Stampacchia|1980|pp=23–49}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Least superharmonic function===
{{See also|Superharmonic function|Viscosity solution}}
A variational argument shows that, away from the contact set, the solution to the obstacle problem is harmonic. A similar argument which restricts itself to variations that are positive shows that the solution is superharmonic on the contact set. Together, the two arguments imply that the solution is a superharmonic function.&lt;ref name="Caf384"/&gt;

In fact, an application of the [[maximum principle]] then shows that the solution to the obstacle problem is the least superharmonic function in the set of admissible functions.&lt;ref name="KS-chapter2"/&gt;

==Regularity properties==
[[File:Ondulationamelioree.jpg|thumb|Solution of a one-dimensional obstacle problem. Notice how the solution stays superharmonic (concave down in 1-D), and matches derivatives with the obstacle (which is the &lt;math&gt;C^{1,1}&lt;/math&gt; condition)]]

===Optimal regularity===
The solution to the obstacle problem has &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle C^{1,1}&lt;/math&gt; regularity, or [[bounded function|bounded]] [[Derivative#Higher derivatives|second derivative]]s, when the obstacle itself has these properties.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvnb|Frehse|1972}}.&lt;/ref&gt; More precisely, the solution's [[modulus of continuity]] and the modulus of continuity for its [[derivative]] are related to those of the obstacle. 
#If the obstacle &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\phi(x)&lt;/math&gt; has modulus of continuity &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\sigma(r)&lt;/math&gt;, that is to say that &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle|\phi(x) - \phi(y)|\leq \sigma(|x-y|)&lt;/math&gt;, then the solution &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle u(x)&lt;/math&gt; has modulus of continuity given by &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle C\sigma(2r)&lt;/math&gt;, where the constant depends only on the domain and not the obstacle.
#If the obstacle's first derivative has modulus of continuity &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\sigma(r)&lt;/math&gt;, then the solution's first derivative has modulus of continuity given by &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle C r \sigma(2r)&lt;/math&gt;, where the constant again depends only on the domain.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvnb|Caffarelli|1998|p=386}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Level surfaces and the free boundary===
Subject to a degeneracy condition, level sets of the difference between the solution and the obstacle, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\{x: u(x) -\phi(x) = t\}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle t &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; are &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle C^{1,\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; surfaces. The free boundary, which is the boundary of the set where the solution meets the obstacle, is also &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle C^{1,\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; except on a set of ''singular points,'' which are themselves either isolated or locally contained on a &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle C^1&lt;/math&gt; manifold.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvnb|Caffarelli|1998|p=394 and 397}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Generalizations==
The theory of the obstacle problem is extended to other divergence form uniformly [[elliptic operator]]s,&lt;ref name="KS-chapter2"/&gt; and their associated energy functionals. It can be generalized to degenerate elliptic operators as well.

The double obstacle problem, where the function is constrained to lie above one obstacle function and below another, is also of interest.

The [[Signorini problem]] is a variant of the obstacle problem, where the energy functional is minimized subject to a constraint which only lives on a surface of one lesser dimension, which includes the ''boundary obstacle problem'', where the constraint operates on the boundary of the domain.

The [[parabolic partial differential equation|parabolic]], time-dependent cases of the obstacle problem and its variants are also objects of study.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4811">In applied statistics, '''optimal estimation''' is a [[regularization (mathematics)|regularized]] [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] [[inverse problem|inverse method]] based on [[Bayes' theorem]].
It is used very commonly in the [[geoscience]]s, particularly for [[atmospheric sounding]].
A matrix inverse problem looks like this:
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{A} \vec x = \vec y
&lt;/math&gt;
The essential concept is to transform the matrix, '''A''', into a [[conditional probability]] and the variables, &lt;math&gt;\vec x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vec y&lt;/math&gt; into probability distributions by assuming Gaussian statistics and using empirically-determined covariance matrices.

==Derivation==

Typically, one expects the statistics of most measurements to be [[normal distribution|Gaussian]].  So for example for &lt;math&gt;P(\vec y|\vec x)&lt;/math&gt;, we can write:

:&lt;math&gt;
P(\vec y|\vec x) = \frac {1} {(2 \pi)^{m n/2} | \boldsymbol{S_y}|}
	\exp \left [ -\frac{1}{2} (\boldsymbol{A} \vec{x} - \vec{y})^T
	\boldsymbol {S_y}^{-1}
	(\boldsymbol{A} \vec{x} - \vec{y}) \right ]
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''m'' and ''n'' are the numbers of elements in &lt;math&gt;\vec x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vec y&lt;/math&gt; respectively &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{A}&lt;/math&gt; is the matrix to be solved (the linear or linearised forward model) and &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{S_y}&lt;/math&gt; is the covariance matrix of the vector &lt;math&gt;\vec y&lt;/math&gt;.  This can be similarly done for &lt;math&gt;\vec x&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;
P(\vec x) = \frac {1} {(2 \pi)^{m/2} | \boldsymbol {S_{x_a}}|}
	\exp \left [-\frac {1}{2} (\vec{x}-\widehat{x_a})^T
	\boldsymbol {S_{x_a}}^{-1} (\vec{x}-\widehat{x_a}) \right ]
&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;P(\vec x)&lt;/math&gt; is taken to be the so-called "a-priori" distribution:  &lt;math&gt;\widehat{x_a}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the a-priori values for &lt;math&gt;\vec{x}&lt;/math&gt; while &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{S_{x_a}}&lt;/math&gt; is its covariance matrix.

The nice thing about the Gaussian distributions is that only two parameters are needed to describe them and so the whole problem can be converted once again to matrices.  Assuming that &lt;math&gt;P(\vec x|\vec y)&lt;/math&gt; takes the following form:

:&lt;math&gt;
P(\vec x|\vec y) = \frac {1} {(2 \pi)^{m n/2} | \boldsymbol {S_x} |}
	\exp \left [ -\frac{1}{2} (\vec{x} - \widehat{x}) ^T
	\boldsymbol {S_x}^{-1} (\vec{x} - \widehat{x}) \right ]
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;P(\vec y)&lt;/math&gt; may be neglected since, for a given value of &lt;math&gt;\vec x&lt;/math&gt;, it is simply a constant scaling term.  Now it is possible to solve for both the expectation value of &lt;math&gt;\vec x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\widehat{x}&lt;/math&gt;, and for its covariance matrix by equating &lt;math&gt;P(\vec x|\vec y)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P(\vec y|\vec x)P(\vec x)&lt;/math&gt;.  This produces the following equations:

:&lt;math&gt;
\boldsymbol{S_x} = (\boldsymbol{A}^T \boldsymbol{S_y^{-1}} \boldsymbol{A} +
	\boldsymbol{S_{x_a}^{-1}})^{-1}
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\widehat{x} = \widehat{x_a} + \boldsymbol{S_x}
	\boldsymbol{A}^T \boldsymbol{S_y}^{-1}(\vec{y}-\boldsymbol{A} \widehat{x_a})
&lt;/math&gt;

Because we are using Gaussians, the expected value is equivalent to the maximum likely value, and so this is also a form of [[maximum likelihood]] estimation.

Typically with optimal estimation, in addition to the vector of retrieved quantities, one extra matrix is returned along with the covariance matrix.  This is sometimes called the resolution matrix or the averaging kernel and is calculated as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;
\boldsymbol{R} = (\boldsymbol{A}^T \boldsymbol{S_y}^{-1} \boldsymbol{A} +
	\boldsymbol{S_{x_a}}^{-1})^{-1}
	\boldsymbol{A}^T \boldsymbol{S_y}^{-1} \boldsymbol{A}
&lt;/math&gt;

This tells us, for a given element of the retrieved vector, how much of the other elements of the vector are mixed in.  In the case of a retrieval of profile information, it typical indicates the altitude resolution for a given altitude.  For instance if the resolution vectors for all the altitudes contain non-zero elements (to a numerical tolerance) in their four nearest neighbours, then the altitude resolution is only one fourth that of the actual grid size.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18799">In [[geometry]], '''[[orbifold]] notation''' (or '''orbifold signature''') is a system, invented by [[William Thurston]] and popularized by the mathematician [[John Horton Conway|John Conway]], for representing types of [[symmetry groups]] in two-dimensional spaces of constant curvature.
The advantage of the notation is that it describes these groups in a way which indicates many of the groups' properties: in particular, it describes the [[orbifold]] obtained by taking the quotient of [[Euclidean space]] by the group under consideration.
 
Groups representable in this notation include the [[point groups in three dimensions|point groups]] on the [[sphere]] (&lt;math&gt;S^2&lt;/math&gt;), the [[frieze group]]s and [[wallpaper group]]s of the [[Euclidean plane]] (&lt;math&gt;E^2&lt;/math&gt;), and their analogues on the [[hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic plane]] (&lt;math&gt;H^2&lt;/math&gt;).

== Definition of the notation ==
The following types of Euclidean transformation can occur in a group described by orbifold notation:

* reflection through a line (or plane)
* translation by a vector
* rotation of finite order around a point
* infinite rotation around a line in 3-space
* glide-reflection, i.e. reflection followed by translation.

All translations which occur are assumed to form a discrete subgroup of the group symmetries being described.

Each group is denoted in orbifold notation by a finite string made up from the following symbols:

* positive ''[[integer]]s'' &lt;math&gt; 1,2,3,\dots &lt;/math&gt;
* the ''[[infinity]]'' symbol, &lt;math&gt; \infty &lt;/math&gt;
* the ''[[asterisk]]'', *
* the symbol ''o'' (a solid circle in older documents), which is called a ''wonder'' and also a ''handle'' because it topologically represents a torus (1-handle) closed surface. Patterns repeat by two translation.
* the symbol &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; (an open circle in older documents), which is called a ''miracle'' and represents a topological [[crosscap]] where a pattern repeats as a mirror image without crossing a mirror line.

A string written in [[boldface]] represents a group of symmetries of Euclidean 3-space. A string not written in boldface represents a group of symmetries of the Euclidean plane, which is assumed to contain two independent translations.

Each symbol corresponds to a distinct transformation:

* an integer ''n'' to the left of an asterisk indicates a [[rotation]] of order ''n'' around a [[gyration point]]
* an integer ''n'' to the right of an asterisk indicates a transformation of order 2''n'' which rotates around a kaleidoscopic point and reflects through a line (or plane)
* an &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; indicates a glide reflection
* the symbol &lt;math&gt; \infty &lt;/math&gt; indicates infinite rotational symmetry around a line; it can only occur for bold face groups. By abuse of language, we might say that such a group is a subgroup of symmetries of the Euclidean plane with only one independent translation. The [[frieze group]]s occur in this way.
* the exceptional symbol ''o'' indicates that there are precisely two linearly independent translations.

=== Good orbifolds ===

An orbifold symbol is called ''good'' if it is not one of the following: ''p'', ''pq'', *''p'', *''pq'', for p,q&gt;=2, and p≠q.

== Chirality and achirality ==
An object is '''chiral''' if its symmetry group contains no reflections; otherwise it is called '''achiral'''. The corresponding orbifold is [[orientability|orientable]] in the chiral case and non-orientable otherwise.

==The Euler characteristic and the order==
The [[Euler characteristic]] of an [[orbifold]] can be read from its Conway symbol, as follows.  Each feature has a value:

* ''n'' without or before an asterisk counts as &lt;math&gt; \frac{n-1}{n} &lt;/math&gt;
* ''n'' after an asterisk counts as &lt;math&gt; \frac{n-1}{2 n} &lt;/math&gt;
* asterisk and &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; count as 1
* ''o'' counts as 2.

Subtracting the sum of these values from 2 gives the Euler characteristic.

If the sum of the feature values is 2, the order is infinite, i.e., the notation represents a wallpaper group or a frieze group.   Indeed, Conway's "Magic Theorem" indicates that the 17 wallpaper groups are exactly those with the sum of the feature values equal to 2.  Otherwise, the order is 2 divided by the Euler characteristic.

==Equal groups==
The following groups are isomorphic:
*1* and *11
*22 and 221
*&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;22 and *221
*2* and 2*1.
This is because 1-fold rotation is the "empty" rotation.

==Two-dimensional groups==

|}
The [[symmetry]] of a [[Two dimension|2D]] object without translational symmetry can be described by the 3D symmetry type by adding a third dimension to the object which does not add or spoil symmetry. For example, for a 2D image we can consider a piece of carton with that image displayed on one side; the shape of the carton should be such that it does not spoil the symmetry, or it can be imagined to be infinite. Thus we have ''n''&amp;bull; and *''n''&amp;bull;. The [[Bullet (typography)|bullet]] (&amp;bull;) is added on one- and two-dimensional groups to imply the existence of a fixed point. (In three dimensions these groups exist in an n-fold [[digon]]al orbifold and are represented as ''nn'' and *''nn''.)

Similarly, a [[One dimension|1D]] image can be drawn horizontally on a piece of carton, with a provision to avoid additional symmetry with respect to the line of the image, e.g. by drawing a horizontal bar under the image. Thus the discrete [[symmetry groups in one dimension]] are *&amp;bull;, *1&amp;bull;, &amp;infin;&amp;bull; and *&amp;infin;&amp;bull;.

Another way of constructing a 3D object from a 1D or 2D object for describing  the symmetry is taking the [[Cartesian product]] of the object and an asymmetric 2D or 1D object, respectively.

[[File:Finite-3-regular-graph-4-vertices.png|thumb|The [[complete graph]] K&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is the smallest planar graph that is not outerplanar.]]
In [[graph theory]], an '''outerplanar graph''' is a graph that has a [[planar graph|planar drawing]] for which all vertices belong to the outer face of the drawing.

Outerplanar graphs may be characterized (analogously to [[Wagner's theorem]] for planar graphs) by the two [[forbidden minor]]s {{math|''K''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''K''&lt;sub&gt;2,3&lt;/sub&gt;}}, or by their [[Colin de Verdière graph invariant]]s.
They have Hamiltonian cycles if and only if they are biconnected, in which case the outer face forms the unique Hamiltonian cycle. Every outerplanar graph is 3-colorable, and has [[Degeneracy (graph theory)|degeneracy]] and [[treewidth]] at most&amp;nbsp;2.

The outerplanar graphs are a subset of the [[planar graph]]s, the subgraphs of [[series-parallel graph]]s, and the [[circle graph]]s. The '''maximal outerplanar graphs''', those to which no more edges can be added while preserving outerplanarity, are also [[chordal graph]]s and [[visibility graph]]s.

==History==
Outerplanar graphs were first studied and named by {{harvtxt|Chartrand|Harary|1967}}, in connection with the problem of determining the planarity of graphs formed by using a [[perfect matching]] to connect two copies of a base graph (for instance, many of the [[generalized Petersen graph]]s are formed in this way from two copies of a [[cycle graph]]). As they showed, when the base graph is [[biconnected graph|biconnected]], a graph constructed in this way is planar if and only if its base graph is outerplanar and the matching forms a [[dihedral group|dihedral]] permutation of its outer cycle. Chartrand and Harary also proved an analogue of [[Kuratowski's theorem]] for outerplanar graphs, that a graph is outerplanar if and only if it does not contain a [[Homeomorphism (graph theory)|subdivision]] of one of the two graphs ''K''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; or ''K''&lt;sub&gt;2,3&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Definition and characterizations==
An outerplanar graph is an [[undirected graph]] that can be [[graph embedding|drawn]] in the [[Euclidean plane|plane]] without [[crossing number (graph theory)|crossings]] in such a way that all of the vertices belong to the unbounded face of the drawing. That is, no vertex is totally surrounded by edges. Alternatively, a graph ''G'' is outerplanar if the graph formed from ''G'' by adding a new vertex, with edges connecting it to all the other vertices, is a [[planar graph]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Felsner|2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''maximal outerplanar graph''' is an outerplanar graph that cannot have any additional edges added to it while preserving outerplanarity. Every maximal outerplanar graph with ''n'' vertices has exactly 2''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;3 edges, and every bounded face of a maximal outerplanar graph is a triangle.

===Forbidden graphs===
Outerplanar graphs have a [[forbidden graph characterization]] analogous to [[Kuratowski's theorem]] and [[Wagner's theorem]] for planar graphs: a graph is outerplanar if and only if it does not contain a [[Homeomorphism (graph theory)|subdivision]] of the [[complete graph]] ''K''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; or the [[complete bipartite graph]] ''K''&lt;sub&gt;2,3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Chartrand|Harary|1967}}; {{harvtxt|Sysło|1979}}; {{harvtxt|Brandstädt|Le|Spinrad|1999}}, Proposition 7.3.1, p. 117; {{harvtxt|Felsner|2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, a graph is outerplanar if and only if it does not contain ''K''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; or ''K''&lt;sub&gt;2,3&lt;/sub&gt; as a [[minor (graph theory)|minor]], a graph obtained from it by deleting and contracting edges.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Diestel|2000}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[triangle-free graph]] is outerplanar if and only if it does not contain a subdivision of ''K''&lt;sub&gt;2,3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="s79"/&gt;

===Colin de Verdière invariant===
A graph is outerplanar if and only if its [[Colin de Verdière graph invariant]] is at most two. The graphs characterized in a similar way by having Colin de Verdière invariant at most one, three, or four are respectively the linear forests, [[planar graph]]s, and
[[linkless embedding|linklessly embeddable graphs]].

==Properties==

===Biconnectivity and Hamiltonicity===
An outerplanar graph is [[biconnected graph|biconnected]] if and only if the outer face of the graph forms a [[cycle (graph theory)|simple cycle]] without repeated vertices. An outerplanar graph is [[Hamiltonian cycle|Hamiltonian]] if and only if it is biconnected; in this case, the outer face forms the unique Hamiltonian cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Chartrand|Harary|1967}}; {{harvtxt|Sysło|1979}}.&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, the size of the longest cycle in an outerplanar graph is the same as the number of vertices in its largest [[biconnected component]]. For this reason finding Hamiltonian cycles and longest cycles in outerplanar graphs may be solved in [[linear time]], in contrast to the [[NP-complete]]ness of these problems for arbitrary graphs.

Every maximal outerplanar graph satisfies a stronger condition than Hamiltonicity: it is [[pancyclic graph|node pancyclic]], meaning that for every vertex ''v'' and every ''k'' in the range from three to the number of vertices in the graph, there is a length-''k'' cycle containing ''v''. A cycle of this length may be found by repeatedly removing a triangle that is connected to the rest of the graph by a single edge, such that the removed vertex is not ''v'', until the outer face of the remaining graph has length ''k''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Li|Corneil|Mendelsohn|2000}}, Proposition 2.5.&lt;/ref&gt;

A planar graph is outerplanar if and only if each of its biconnected components is outerplanar.&lt;ref name="s79"&gt;{{harvtxt|Sysło|1979}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coloring===
All loopless outerplanar graphs can be [[graph coloring|colored]] using only three colors;&lt;ref name="ps86"&gt;{{harvtxt|Proskurowski|Sysło|1986}}.&lt;/ref&gt; this fact features prominently in the simplified proof of [[Václav Chvátal|Chvátal's]] [[art gallery theorem]] by {{harvtxt|Fisk|1978}}. A 3-coloring may be found in [[linear time]] by a [[greedy coloring]] algorithm that removes any vertex of [[degree (graph theory)|degree]] at most two, colors the remaining graph recursively, and then adds back the removed vertex with a color different from the colors of its two neighbors.

According to [[Vizing's theorem]], the [[chromatic index]] of any graph (the minimum number of colors needed to color its edges so that no two adjacent edges have the same color) is either the maximum [[degree (graph theory)|degree]] of any vertex of the graph or one plus the maximum degree. However, in an outerplanar graph, the chromatic index is equal to the maximum degree except when the graph forms a [[cycle (graph theory)|cycle]] of odd length.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Fiorini|1975}}.&lt;/ref&gt; An edge coloring with an optimal number of colors can be found in linear time based on a [[breadth first search|breadth-first traversal]] of the weak dual tree.&lt;ref name="ps86"/&gt;

===Other properties===
Outerplanar graphs have [[degeneracy (graph theory)|degeneracy]] at most two: every subgraph of an outerplanar graph contains a vertex with degree at most two.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lick|White|1970}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Outerplanar graphs have [[treewidth]] at most two, which implies that many graph optimization problems that are [[NP-complete]] for arbitrary graphs may be solved in [[polynomial time]] by [[dynamic programming]] when the input is outerplanar. More generally, ''k''-outerplanar graphs have treewidth O(''k'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Baker|1994}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Every outerplanar graph can be represented as an [[intersection graph]] of axis-aligned rectangles in the plane, so outerplanar graphs have [[boxicity]] at most two.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Scheinerman|1984}}; {{harvtxt|Brandstädt|Le|Spinrad|1999}}, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related families of graphs==
[[File:Cactus graph.svg|thumb|A [[cactus graph]]. The cacti form a subclass of the outerplanar graphs.]]
Every outerplanar graph is a [[planar graph]].
Every outerplanar graph is also a subgraph of a [[series-parallel graph]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Brandstädt|Le|Spinrad|1999}}, p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all planar series-parallel graphs are outerplanar.  
The [[complete bipartite graph]] ''K''&lt;sub&gt;2,3&lt;/sub&gt; is planar and series-parallel but not outerplanar. On the other hand, the [[complete graph]] ''K''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is planar but neither series-parallel nor outerplanar.  
Every [[tree (graph theory)|forest]] and every [[cactus graph]] are outerplanar.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Brandstädt|Le|Spinrad|1999}}, p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[planar dual|weak planar dual]] graph of an embedded outerplanar graph (the graph that has a vertex for every bounded face of the embedding, and an edge for every pair of adjacent bounded faces) is a forest, and the weak planar dual of a [[Halin graph]] is an outerplanar graph. A planar graph is outerplanar if and only if its weak dual is a forest, and it is Halin if and only if its weak dual is biconnected and outerplanar.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Sysło|Proskurowski|1983}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a notion of degree of outerplanarity.  A 1-outerplanar embedding of a graph is the same as an outerplanar embedding.  For ''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;1 a planar embedding is said to be ''' ''k''-outerplanar''' if removing the vertices on the outer face results in a (''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)-outerplanar embedding.  
A graph is ''k''-outerplanar if it has a ''k''-outerplanar embedding.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kane|Basu|1976}}; {{harvtxt|Sysło|1979}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[1-planar graph#Generalizations and related concepts|outer-1-planar graph]], analogously to [[1-planar graph]]s can be drawn in a disk, with the vertices on the boundary of the disk, and with at most one crossing per edge.

Every maximal outerplanar graph is a [[chordal graph]]. Every maximal outerplanar graph is the [[visibility graph]] of a [[simple polygon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|El-Gindy|1985}}; {{harvtxt|Lin|Skiena|1995}}; {{harvtxt|Brandstädt|Le|Spinrad|1999}}, Theorem 4.10.3, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; Maximal outerplanar graphs are also formed as the graphs of [[polygon triangulation]]s. They are examples of [[k-tree|2-trees]], of [[series-parallel graph]]s, and of [[chordal graph]]s.

Every outerplanar graph is a [[circle graph]], the [[intersection graph]] of a set of chords of a circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Wessel|Pöschel|1985}}; {{harvtxt|Unger|1988}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Problems, Problems, Problems''''' is a series of educational mathematics textbooks ranging from grade 7-12. The math questions are from previous math contests held by the [[Centre for Education in Mathematics and Computing]] at the [[University of Waterloo]]. The series is a resource to complement the Canadian high school curriculum and for self-development, although it is also used to study for the CEMC Math Contests. Each combined grade level has several book volumes. Each book contains around 300 questions, and is categorized into various sections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CEMC University of Waterloo: Books and Posters|url=http://cemc.math.uwaterloo.ca/books.html|publisher=University of Waterloo|accessdate=21 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each question has a reference number in the form "year-contest-question number".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=PROBLEMS, PROBLEMS, PROBLEMS Grades 11-12 Volume 3|isbn=978-0-921418-02-3|publisher=Waterloo Mathematics Foundation|date=April 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4440">'''Risk intelligence''' is a [[concept]] that generally means "beyond [[risk management]]", though it has been used in different ways by different writers. The term is being used more frequently by business strategists when discussing [[Integrative thinking|integrative]] business processes related to governance, risk, and compliance.

== Definitions ==
The first non-definitive usage of the phrase '''Risk Intelligence''' appears in the 1980s and aligns to the definition of ''intelligence'' as being information from an enemy (for example, regarding [[credit risk]].)&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
 | last = Dedijer
 | first = Stevan
 | title = Intelligence for Economic Development: An Inquiry into the Role of the Knowledge Industry
 | publisher = Berg Pub Ltd
 | location = Oxford
 | date = 1987
 | page = 288
 | isbn = 978-0854965205
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The topic of balancing risk and innovation using information and the cognitive processes involved also appears at this time.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
 | last = Fischhoff
 | first = Baruch 
 | title = Acceptable Risk
 | publisher = Cambridge University Press
 | location = Cambridge 
 | date = 1984
 | page = 204
 | isbn =  978-0521278928
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent usage is more aligned to ''[[intelligence]]'' as understanding and problem solving.

The US business writer David Apgar defines it as the capacity to learn about risk from experience.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
 | last = Apgar
 | first = David

 | title = Risk Intelligence: Learning to Manage What We Don't Know
 | publisher = Harvard Business School Publishing

 | isbn = 1-59139-954-8
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Management consultant and risk advisor Rick Funston defines risk intelligence as a dynamic approach to protect and create value amid uncertainty.
It is an enterprise wide process integrating people, processes (systems), and tools
to increase information available to decision makers for improved decision making.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
 | last = Funston
 | first = Frederick
 | title = Surviving and thriving in uncertainty: creating the risk intelligent enterprise
 | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.
 | location = Hoboken, New Jersey
 | date = 2010
 | page = 338
 | isbn = 978-0-470-24788-4
 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK philosopher and psychologist [[Dylan Evans]] defines it as "a special kind of intelligence for thinking about risk and uncertainty", at the core of which is the ability to estimate probabilities accurately.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
 | last = Evans
 | first = Dylan
 | authorlink = Dylan Evans
 | title = Risk Intelligence: How to Live with Uncertainty
 | publisher = Free Press
 | location = New York
 | date = 2012
 | page = 288
 | isbn = 978-1-4516-1090-1
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Evans includes a risk intelligence test (RQ) in his book and on his website (below) analogous to 
[[Intelligence quotient|IQ]] or [[Emotional intelligence|EQ]].

American financial executive, author, and Columbia University professor [[Leo Tilman]] defined risk intelligence as “The organizational ability to think holistically about risk and uncertainty, speak a common risk language, and effectively use forward-looking risk concepts and tools in making better decisions, alleviating threats, capitalizing on opportunities, and creating lasting value.”
&lt;ref&gt;Tilman, L.. [http://www.europeanfinancialreview.com/?p=591 Risk Intelligence: A Bedrock of Dynamism and Lasting Value Creation] Retrieved 2015-04-01&lt;/ref&gt; He has argued that risk intelligence is essential to survival, success, and relevance of companies and investors in the post-crisis world.

==Comparison with business intelligence==
As an emerging concept, risk intelligence shares characteristics with other topics such as [[business intelligence]] and [[competitive intelligence]]. As such, there are some in those camps who believe that risk intelligence is the set of processes for the transformation of risk data into meaningful and useful information for risk analysis, treatment and planning purposes.

In the mathematical and algorithmic study of [[graph theory]], the '''converse''',&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Harary |first1=Frank |last2=Norman |first2=Robert Z. |last3=Cartwright |first3=Dorwin |year=1965 |title=Structural Models: An Introduction to the Theory of Directed Graphs |publisher=Wiley |place=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''transpose'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Introduction to Algorithms}}, ex. 22.1–3, p. 530.&lt;/ref&gt; or '''reverse'''&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Essam |first1=John W. |last2=Fisher |first2=Michael E. |author2-link=Michael Fisher |year=1970 |title=Some basic definitions in graph theory |journal=Reviews of Modern Physics |doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.42.271 |bibcode=1970RvMP...42..271E |volume=42 |issue=2 |page=275}}, entry 2.24&lt;/ref&gt; of a [[directed graph]] ''G'' is another directed graph on the same set of vertices with all of the edges reversed compared to the orientation of the corresponding edges in ''G''. That is, if ''G'' contains an edge ''(u,v)'' then the converse/transpose/reverse of ''G'' contains an edge ''(v,u)'' and vice versa.

==Notation==
The name ''converse'' arises because the reversal of arrows corresponds to taking the [[converse (logic)|converse]] of an implication in logic. The name ''transpose'' is because the [[adjacency matrix]] of the transpose directed graph is the [[transpose]] of the adjacency matrix of the original directed graph.  
  
There is no general agreement on preferred terminology.

The converse is denoted symbolically as ''G''', ''G''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;, ''G''&lt;sup&gt;R&lt;/sup&gt;, or other notations, depending on which terminology is used and which book or article is the source for the notation.

==Applications==
Although there is little difference mathematically between a graph and its transpose, the difference may be larger in [[computer science]], depending on how a given graph is represented. For instance, for the [[web graph]], it is easy to determine the outgoing links of a vertex, but hard to determine the incoming links, while in the reversal of this graph the opposite is true. In [[graph algorithm]]s, therefore, it may sometimes be useful to construct the reversal of a graph, in order to put the graph into a form which is more suitable for the operations being performed on it. An example of this is [[Kosaraju's algorithm]] for [[strongly connected component]]s, which applies [[depth first search]] twice, once to the given graph and a second time to its reversal.

==Related concepts==
A [[skew-symmetric graph]] is a graph that is [[graph isomorphism|isomorphic]] to its own transpose graph, via a special kind of isomorphism that pairs up all of the vertices.

The [[converse relation]] of a [[binary relation]] is the relation that reverses the ordering of each pair of related objects. If the relation is interpreted as a directed graph, this is the same thing as the transpose of the graph. In particular, the [[order dual]] of a [[partial order]] can be interpreted in this way as the transposition of a [[transitive closure|transitively-closed]] [[directed acyclic graph]].

[[File:Illustration of supremum.svg|thumb|300px|A set with upper bounds and its least upper bound.]]
In [[mathematics]],  especially in [[order theory]], an '''upper bound''' of a [[subset]] ''S'' of some [[partially ordered set]] (''K'', ≤) is an element of ''K'' which is [[greater than or equal to]] every element of ''S''.&lt;ref name="MacLane-Birkhoff" /&gt; The term '''lower bound''' is defined [[duality (order theory)|dually]] as an element of ''K'' which is less than or equal to every element of ''S''. A set with an upper bound is said to be '''bounded from above''' by that bound, a set with a lower bound is said to be '''bounded from below''' by that bound. The terms '''bounded above''' ('''bounded below''') are also used in the mathematical literature for sets that have upper (respectively lower) bounds. 

== Examples ==

For example, 5 is a lower bound for the set { 5, 8, 42, 34, 13934 }; so is 4 if 4 belongs to the set K; but 6 is not as the set is ordered and 6 does not belong to set K.

Another example: for the set { 42 }, the number 42 is both an upper bound and a lower bound; all other real numbers are either an upper bound or a lower bound for that set.

Every subset of the [[natural number]]s has a lower bound, since the natural numbers have a least element (0, or 1 depending on the exact definition of natural numbers). An infinite subset of the natural numbers cannot be bounded from above. An infinite subset of the [[integer]]s may be bounded from below or bounded from above, but not both. An infinite subset of the [[rational number]]s may or may not be bounded from below and may or may not be bounded from above.

Every finite subset of a non-empty [[totally ordered set]] has both upper and lower bounds.

==Bounds of functions==

The definitions can be generalized to [[Function (mathematics)|functions]] and even sets of functions.

Given a function {{italics correction|{{mvar|f}}}} with [[Domain (mathematics)|domain]] {{mvar|D}} and a partially ordered set {{math|(''K'', ≤)}} as [[codomain]], an element {{mvar|''y''}} of {{mvar|K}} is an upper bound of {{italics correction|{{mvar|f}}}} if {{math|''y'' ≥ {{italics correction|''f''}}(''x'')}} for each {{mvar|x}} in {{mvar|D}}. The upper bound is called ''[[Mathematical jargon#sharp|sharp]]'' if equality holds for at least one value of {{mvar|x}}.

Function {{mvar|g}} defined on domain {{mvar|D}} and having the same codomain {{math|(''K'', ≤)}} is an upper bound of {{italics correction|{{mvar|f}}}} if {{math|''g''(''x'') ≥ {{italics correction|''f''}}(''x'')}} for each {{mvar|x}} in {{mvar|D}}.

Function {{mvar|g}} is further said to be an upper bound of a set of functions if it is an upper bound of each function in that set.

The notion of lower bound for (sets of) functions is defined analogously, with ≤ replacing ≥.

==Tight bounds==

An upper bound is said to be a ''tight upper bound'', a ''least upper bound'', or a ''[[supremum]]'' if no smaller value is an upper bound.
Similarly a lower bound is said to be a ''tight lower bound'', a ''greatest lower bound'', or an ''[[infimum]]'' if no greater value is a lower bound.
